0.40 2.48 B: hello my name is joanne 

2.56 5.20 A: hi my name is daniel 

4.61 6.16 B: oh hi how are you 

6.49 12.23 B: do you believe that five dollars and fifteen cents an hour minimum wage is enough to live on is enough 

12.90 19.36 A: [sigh] uh personally i think i mean you can get by on it if you really need to like 

19.36 34.13 A: if you're working forty hours a week and you're getting minimum wage i guess you might be able to get like room and board uh or basically just afford to live in s- like some kind of uh apartment and pay for food but that would pretty much 

34.33 43.35 A: just like the bare necessities and maybe the bus to work but i don't know about like owning a car or any anything like that what do you think about it 

42.98 51.83 B: [lipsmack] i don't think you'd be able to own a car and uh i- if you know er uh even as far as food i think that would be um 

51.95 55.79 B: not too much food not too nutritious uh 

55.96 65.92 B: and uh y- you'd have to get an awful uh cheap apartment or maybe share a room with somebody or or an apartment with somebody or something i think 

66.30 72.06 B: i i i i don't see how it's enough to live to me it doesn't seem like it's enough to live on [lipsmack] 

72.68 74.73 A: yeah like i mean i could see 

74.92 79.62 A: 'cause it's five fifteen when do you know when it was raised to five fifteen 

80.28 87.77 B: i always thought that the minimum wage was six seventy five an hour out here in california minimum wage is six seventy five an hour 

88.54 98.49 A: i'm in tennessee and it and it's five fifteen in like mcdonald's and burger king and they all get away with paying like the younger kids like that much money but 

99.14 105.02 B: well if you live home with your parents or something er i suppose it's all right i mean y- y- you didn't 

105.05 117.81 B: have to spend money to live on you know for room and board and of course you could never have a car or any uh luxuries you'd never be able to go out to eat or to the movies or nothing and [sigh] 

117.70 127.97 A: [sigh] 'cause i mean i'm i'm twenty years old and i live with my parents and i don't even have a job but if i did have a job and i was getting five fifteen minimum wage i mean they're like pretty much supporting me 

127.81 137.28 A: and they they gave me a car they paid my car insurance and basically i don't have any type of bills right now that i have to pay and i'm going to college so 

137.39 146.49 A: uh basically all the movies uh all the money i mean i wouldn't be able to live off it though because i am like completely mooching off my parents so 

146.82 147.68 B: oh 

148.14 160.35 B: yeah well uh maybe you could give them some money that way if you earned five fifteen an hour er something to show to them that you appreciate uh what they're doing for you and that you're not you know 

160.36 162.29 B: just a total mooch i guess 

162.10 162.98 A: (( mm )) 

162.41 163.00 B: (( [sigh] )) 

162.93 177.71 A: but just all the things like nowadays er you i mean you just think about all the things that like is necessary like i mean owning a car a lot of people like to like to own a car and if you do own a car you have to pay like of course the car payment and then you it's 

178.06 188.32 A: like insurance for the car and and if you own a home you have to have like i i don't know if it's legal to have home owner's insurance in california but uh 

187.56 192.02 B: we do we have home owners insurance we have to have home owners insurance 

192.22 198.41 A: yeah and then i mean it's just like it's like you legally have to have automotive insurance 

198.08 206.92 B: yeah it's the law here we have to have vehicle insurance if we get caught driving without vehicle insurance we have to pay extra money for that it's an extra fine [mn] 

208.70 212.84 A: so five fifteen uh yeah 

216.25 218.46 B: yeah it is hard er 

218.87 221.06 B: it's very hard um 

222.00 224.20 B: yeah 

223.47 232.65 A: but it's if you're getting forty hours a week and it's about five fifteen so you're roughly getting two hundred dollars a week 

232.53 241.06 A: so roughly i mean we're roughly speaking about eight hundred dollars a month could you personally live off eight hundred dollars in one month 

241.73 242.78 B: uh 

243.09 249.91 B: yeah i think i could of course i wouldn't have a car i wouldn't have maintenance on a car i wouldn't have uh 

249.82 262.04 B: at least ten dollars a day every day in gasoline which is what i have now i wouldn't have insurance uh i wouldn't have parking problems i always seem to get parking fines also and um 

262.21 262.77 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

263.53 264.33 B: (( oh )) 

265.91 267.77 A: yeah i think uh 

268.44 276.72 A: i think if i had to i could probably do it but like the living would probably be the most money to live off or uh like 

276.89 287.97 A: wherever you live your residency 'cause that would probably be a majority of the money is just going to where you live and you'd probably have to have like room mates and like split an apartment or 

288.01 292.61 A: split something to you know save money and then food and 

292.69 300.34 A: like i don't know get or i'd get the bus to work or something and live or have a job that's closer to where you live than anywhere else 

301.20 304.03 B: yeah yeah you would uh 

304.43 315.45 B: you'd have to uh live pretty close to where uh you worked so you could walk there and back or something and uh yeah it's difficult it's very difficult 

316.60 318.19 B: (( uh [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

318.97 325.98 A: so it's six seventy five in california that's like the minimum wage it's like a state law instead of a federal 

325.90 337.60 B: uh i think it is a state law instead of federal we used to uh have uh five fifteen an hour and then it went it up to uh six dollars an hour and now it's at six seventy five an hour 

338.22 352.13 A: yeah i mean they i've i've hear i've been hearing talks like over the past few years like they're going like people i mean they're just rumors but people talk about them raising it and then it never i mean tennessee it's really the cost of living isn't too high here so 

351.99 358.14 A: i guess people can get away with it 'cause i mean i guess i personally i i probably could live off it 

359.04 369.07 B: oh yeah yeah well one might be surprised what one uh can do if one has to do it i suppose but there are still some people uh it's uh 

369.67 373.96 B: extenuating circumstances that they wouldn't be able to do it 

374.13 376.65 B: that they would become disabled 

377.67 384.18 A: because you're pretty much you you wouldn't have much leeway you wouldn't have much uh of a like 

384.62 393.13 A: i don't know how to say it but any it's anything like to fall back on because you wouldn't have a lot of money to save or anything like that 

392.51 399.09 B: yeah yeah that's true i i would think you wouldn't have any money to save but definitely not a lot of money to save 

400.11 402.94 B: yeah 

402.23 404.19 A: (( so what uh )) 

404.74 408.89 A: do you think if they if they raised it that would help people out 

409.25 412.17 A: if they raised it like you so let's say 

412.29 418.95 A: seven dollars and a quarter an hour if that would help a lot of people out if like people that are having trouble 

419.12 428.58 B: uh yeah i think so i believe so yeah yeah 'cause that's uh yeah a fifty cent an hour raise yeah yeah [noise] 

428.77 432.53 A: that is 'cause they are i mean forty hours times 

432.80 438.33 A: like even one a quarter is that would be like an extra ten dollars a week 

438.39 441.10 A: and that's every week so it'd be 

441.59 444.41 A: another five hundred dollars just over a year so 

444.79 448.43 B: yeah yeah 

448.54 452.01 B: [noise] about five hundred a year that'd be an extra five hundred a year 

451.86 460.96 A: i say yeah that's just for a quarter and if you're working forty hours a week and fifty i mean that's just rough on like i'm not a math major or anything but 

461.32 469.69 B: [mn] yeah that sounds about right an extra five hundred a year yeah i think that would help i think it would help a lot uh 

470.20 479.70 B: yeah [mn] and i guess mcdonalds and burger king and uh [lipsmack] carl's junior they all pay the same thing right 

479.51 491.68 A: they yeah they basically all pay right around like five fifteen maybe five fifty but and then you don't really get much higher than like six dollars an hour after you work for a year or so i mean i've 

491.69 494.75 A: i've worked at a f- a fast food restaurant 

494.76 508.16 A: i worked it's carl carl's junior is arby's here and they're like the same type of thing and i worked there and i think i got minimum wage for and i worked there for a few months and that's and i didn't get a raise or anything and but i i i've always lived with my parents so [sigh] 

498.26 499.06 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

508.64 511.53 B: yeah so with you it didn't bother anyhow 

511.20 517.87 A: yeah so i haven't really had any i don't have to worry about paying for food or anything and 

513.01 514.49 B: (( didn't affect you )) 

517.10 520.28 B: did they give you any free food there for working there 

520.32 527.22 A: uh yes pretty much you got a free meal uh every day that you worked so it was pretty nice 

526.89 529.40 B: oh well that was nice that's nice 

527.48 529.51 A: so that was kind of good 

530.04 537.88 A: for supporting yourself on minimum wage and if you worked uh i i wouldn't say the majority of jobs but the majority of jobs that i'm familiar with 

538.04 541.66 A: that pay minimum wage would be jobs like that i mean 

540.90 543.30 B: (( yeah )) 

543.45 547.29 B: (( [noise] [mn] yeah yeah [sigh] )) 

549.01 550.01 B: um 

550.24 558.15 B: yeah [mn] well it's pretty nice though to get a a free lunch every day for working you just got one free meal a day though right 

557.67 559.06 A: yes 

558.47 559.96 B: oh yeah 

559.46 562.15 A: so if you worked an eight hour shift then 

560.12 560.88 B: (( yeah )) 

562.20 567.18 A: like you might get it right in the center of it and then when you get home you'd probably still have to eat again so 

567.16 569.15 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

568.08 572.08 A: but just thinking about it like all the things that you have to pay for and all the 

572.64 577.04 A: all the necessities like you can't i mean i guess you could survive off 

577.14 591.88 A: raman noodles and drinking water and yeah like you as you were saying earlier not a very good diet and e- and especially if you are if the money was really short your diet would probably be lacking in the nutrition department 

591.52 598.20 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah
