158.70 163.61 B: mhm yeah but you can't you can't put it too high because then 

159.84 161.40 A: then i guess i 

163.87 169.49 B: people [noise] make working at [noise] mcdonalds will be making as much as people 

163.91 164.78 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

169.58 173.93 B: working at harder jobs that you have to go to school and everything for 

172.37 175.41 A: [noise] you think so eight dollars 

175.55 177.64 B: i think eight is a bit much though 

176.05 181.92 A: [noise] [lipsmack] i guess you want to make it a nice balance for people who [noise] think it's worthwhile to go to work [noise] [noise] 

181.05 185.56 B: mhm i i think like six fifty maybe would be fair 

183.98 191.01 A: i would go to work for [noise] free right now [noise] if like somebody [laughter] could take my kids away from me [laughter] [laughter] 

188.99 190.10 B: (( [laughter] [mn] ))

194.21 197.64 A: [noise] a daycare that's another thing i guess [noise] if it's five fifteen an hour 

197.45 202.42 A: [noise] you know it it affects [noise] things like daycare [noise] c- cost of daycare [noise] when you have to r- pay 

202.21 212.73 A: more to these daycare employees and the [noise] parents have to pay more to get their [noise] child to watch the daycare [noise] and then it's a vicious cycle [noise] and then they can't um afford to go to work anyway 

208.96 209.87 B: mhm 

212.26 213.40 B: (( [noise] ))

399.01 400.64 A: yeah yeah 

400.71 401.72 A: (( [cough] )) 

404.51 416.76 A: i guess it's just a starting point like a company could say we'll start you at minimum wage three months we'll review you raise you up fifty cents and then another fifty cents kind of gets you in the door they have to start somewhere at least there's some place to start [cough] 

406.34 408.60 B: mhm 

416.31 424.51 B: yeah but see like i know mcdonalds and stuff starts real low like that but i know at home depot my stepdad would started working there they'd start him off at fourteen fifty an hour 

423.45 425.93 A: oh really well that's not so bad 

424.56 430.53 B: yeah yeah so it just i guess depends on where you're going what ya doing 

427.57 429.68 A: well yeah 

429.92 441.95 A: i usually get [noise] i usually find out what i need to find out at home depot so you know it's one thing which is true you get what you pay for with your employees if you're gonna pay [noise] them five dollars an hour you're gonna get a five dollar an hour employee if you if 

440.81 442.55 B: mhm 

442.04 453.40 A: you pay them a little more you're gonna weed out that and you're gonna get yourself more people applying for the job and then you're going to be able to choose [noise] from the people [noise] to take the job and [noise] you're gonna get a better per- better quality person [noise] i don't know [noise] 

443.01 444.07 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

449.35 451.81 B: mhm

506.61 517.41 A: and i have a two year old and a four year old and uh i used to work obviously and i couldn't afford to work now because it's too expensive i couldn't even i mean specifically minimum job but even a job that pays 

513.21 515.41 B: mhm 

517.36 524.85 A: forty thousand a year it isn't even worth working when you have two small children and it's a hundred and seventy five a week for daycare 

525.12 525.88 B: (( mm )) 

525.54 528.86 A: i don't know if you knew that daycare was that expensive but it is so 

529.18 533.82 A: [cough] but i think if you're making minimum wage you're with family and you're under a certain income level 

534.51 537.70 A: you're able to [sigh] uh get some help 

535.56 543.65 B: [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah that's what i was that's what i was just about to ask you um if they offer uh 'cause i thought they did offer some help for daycare 

538.79 539.52 A: (( [cough] )) 

542.82 550.81 A: i think if you're re- below a certain income level i mean there's all sorts of programmes out there i don't i'm not really aware of it i'm i'm not you know i- in that income level 

547.31 548.98 B: hm 

550.90 552.43 A: but um [sigh] 

552.98 556.28 A: you know if i needed to have it i would be glad that it was there because 

555.72 557.50 B: yeah 

556.54 561.49 A: you never know in this day and age i'd i know more people now that are out of work 

561.91 567.40 A: than i've ever known in all my years i mean back in ninety one er 

561.93 563.30 B: mhm 

564.55 566.51 B: mhm

567.69 568.68 B: [noise] 

570.45 574.60 A: everybody was losing their job it was everybody i know and no one's getting any calls 

573.79 576.25 B: mhm 

575.24 578.02 A: so it's pretty scary out there you know 

576.42 583.81 B: yeah that's 'cause there's so many more people around now [noise] so the people uh better people are getting the jobs 

583.07 592.96 A: yeah you know i i really think it's easier for people to apply for jobs now now that they're people can apply online they're zapping their resume over to these companies they're getting bombarded and they're they're 

591.44 594.00 B: (( mhm )) 

592.76 598.66 A: they're not able to weed out these people need to make themselves stand out a little bit more and there's there's gotta be some new way to f- 

598.68 599.89 A: promote yourself besides 

599.00 599.89 B: mhm
