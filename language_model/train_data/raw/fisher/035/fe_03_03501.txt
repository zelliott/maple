3.51 5.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

8.13 9.20 B: hello 

8.88 10.13 A: (( h- hello )) 

10.16 13.40 B: yeah did you hear what the topic was 

12.87 14.72 A: yes minimum wage 

14.75 19.43 B: minimum wage [noise] and what do they want us to talk about 

15.82 16.74 A: yes 

18.82 22.69 A: um well do you think the minimum wage is um 

22.72 28.65 A: they raised it to to five dollars and fifteen cents an hour do you think it is um that's sufficient 

28.90 33.67 B: well no [laughter] i don't think anybody does 

30.36 32.81 A: [laughter] well why 

33.17 34.57 A: why not 

34.40 37.07 B: 'cause everybody wants to get as much as they can 

36.67 40.47 A: well of course so how much do you think that it should be 

40.68 50.31 B: at least be six fifty since most jobs are like most like low paying jobs are like seven dollars an hour that's what you consider a low paying job 

50.07 51.47 A: well ten dollars 

50.35 54.56 B: minimum wage should should at least be six fifty 

56.01 57.34 A: six fifty 

57.16 59.28 B: yeah 

59.37 63.77 A: what so why do you think the uh the government makes it so low 

65.36 71.36 B: so that you have to work for it [laughter] and they have more people working more hours that's why 

66.92 68.51 A: [laughter] 

71.06 81.40 A: right 'cause i know i just applied for a job and i think the starting was nine dollars and it was like a you know a typical just grocery store job 

81.37 84.24 B: yeah well nine dollars an hour is pretty good 

83.66 89.03 A: yeah no it is but so i don't think a lotta people even follow the minimum wage 

89.11 93.87 A: um except maybe for really like you know low low paying jobs 

93.83 97.06 B: yeah jobs nobody wants [laughter] 

96.53 99.74 A: [laughter] right yeah i'm not even sure 

100.05 103.04 A: what jobs do do minimum wage 

103.26 105.48 B: those are like factory jobs [mn] 

105.03 109.99 A: yeah well 'cause i know even when i was at high school i was getting like eight dollars an hour 

110.63 111.96 A: for you know 

113.08 118.17 A: a lowly job so i guess maybe they're paying five fifteen to immigrants 

118.37 120.87 A: or you know people that don't any better 

118.41 122.60 B: [laughter] no i think they get i think they get less than that 

121.95 124.07 A: (( do they get less than that )) 

123.45 128.63 B: yeah they get like four twenty five or something like that 

124.37 125.79 A: [lipsmack] well isn't 

128.17 131.79 A: well don't um companies have to um 

132.71 135.47 A: don't they have to at least offer minimum wage 

136.37 139.61 B: that depends on where you go and who you are 

140.23 151.05 B: i mean if you're an immigrant you know nothing about minimum wage they're gonna hit you with anything basically they will pay you two dollars an hour and just work twenty four hours a day [laughter] 

144.14 145.39 A: they're gonna that's right 

150.35 151.20 A: (( [laughter] )) 

151.31 156.35 A: and they can get away with it because usually they don't speak english and they don't know any better 

156.18 158.33 B: (( yeah )) 

158.34 161.32 A: and they don't know that they don't know the laws 

161.26 162.74 B: so it always depends 

167.17 170.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

172.06 174.99 B: (( i'm waiting for somebody i'm sorry )) 

175.12 175.82 A: (( okay )) 

176.03 179.58 A: so do you think six dollars and fifty cents would be sufficient 

179.93 184.01 B: ah it'll be enough to get by until you find a better job 

185.18 186.33 B: (( [noise] right )) 

185.73 187.09 A: yeah 

187.60 190.61 A: yeah i guess six dollars and fifty cents would be 

191.60 192.72 A: (( would be )) 

191.81 195.50 B: enough to get by until you can find something better 

193.34 194.24 A: sufficient 

195.67 199.76 A: i don't even know do you know how they the government even um 

200.80 202.34 A: determines 

202.81 205.86 A: the minimum wage yeah i have no idea 

202.84 204.36 B: the minimum wage 

205.89 218.00 B: i don't know either i think they they just bring it up every couple of years since uh the economy goes up and everything else goes up they say hey we may as well bring the minimum wage up 

217.49 221.02 A: well if they just brought it up the economy is crappy right 

221.16 222.08 A: (( now )) 

221.66 223.28 B: [laughter] 

222.27 225.99 A: [laughter] it like sucks and no one can find a job so 

225.54 226.40 B: (( yeah )) 

226.03 228.62 A: that's good that they're at least raising it 

228.95 231.12 A: um somewhat 

231.38 232.50 A: but i don't 

231.48 235.90 B: yeah but they're still raising it to where nobody wants those jobs like 

236.23 242.40 B: even though nobody you could be not working you can go to a minimum wage place and always get a job 

242.72 243.97 B: always 

244.60 247.83 B: you know like i mean they'll hire you that same day 

247.82 250.28 A: right so what kind of jobs are those 

250.59 252.98 B: i told you those are like factory jobs 

252.12 255.18 A: factory jobs like jobs no one wants 

254.82 261.91 B: yeah like you stand on stand all day and do like what do you call it 

261.84 263.22 A: sorta like um 

263.33 264.85 A: [lipsmack] assembly lines 

264.52 269.02 B: yeah you do like assembly line stuff my cousin used to work the 

269.30 271.47 B: he used to tell me about it 

269.32 270.21 A: and 

271.79 274.91 A: wow and just like minimum wage 

274.77 282.75 B: yeah and you've gotta take a lotta crap you get like fifteen minute breaks lunch is like twenty minutes 

283.50 284.55 B: [noise] 

283.88 287.03 A: so they work you to death and then don't pay you anything 

287.33 289.36 B: yeah 

289.96 291.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

292.28 296.18 A: and so and now the government's saying five fifteen is sufficient [laughter] 

296.49 297.57 B: (( huh )) 

297.25 301.38 A: and now the government's saying only five dollars and fifteen cents is sufficient 

301.47 306.01 B: yeah how much was it before four 

304.46 307.14 A: i have no idea [laughter] was it like 

306.19 316.08 B: four seventy five i think but that's not even a big raise or anything four seventy five is practically five dollars anyway 

307.96 310.60 A: yeah i think it was like four seventy five 

313.03 313.76 A: (( [mn] )) 

317.64 318.77 A: so how 

317.73 321.95 B: and what fifteen more cents how is that 

320.72 323.90 A: how often do they do they raise the minimum wage 

324.54 325.60 B: never 

325.36 326.76 A: never [laughter] 

327.43 331.71 B: [laughter] after like a year i think i think two years 

332.21 333.90 B: they give you a raise 

334.41 335.94 A: (( maybe yeah )) 

336.20 341.92 B: [noise] but i think if you get uh if you get a raise then they want you to work for the company permanently 

336.74 337.75 A: that's pretty 

343.79 345.02 A: oh really 

344.89 354.61 B: yeah 'cause you're gonna move up to the the minimum wage job believe it or not you can move up to those jobs it just takes a really long time 

352.63 355.76 A: how do you move how do you move up in those jobs 

356.06 357.26 B: well 

358.08 363.48 B: i mean of course you move from the assembly line [laughter] two years later you can move to uh 

365.20 366.20 B: (( [noise] )) 

367.20 373.16 B: two years later from there you can move up to like line manager or something like that 

372.09 375.64 A: so you just basically have to work hard and take a lotta crap [laughter] 

376.60 381.53 B: take a lotta crap for a long time yeah [noise] 

377.62 379.41 A: yeah [laughter] 

379.74 384.22 A: take a lotta crap for a long time and work your way up 

384.05 388.36 B: yeah and once you get to supervisor you're good 

388.07 390.88 A: but how long does that take you a long time [laughter] 

390.29 395.57 B: [lipsmack] probably like five years [laughter] i'd rather work in mcdonalds 

395.77 397.64 A: oh well they pay 

397.70 401.46 A: i had a friend who worked at mcdonalds and i think they pay more than the minimum wage 

401.21 404.16 B: yeah they pay like seven and over 

404.56 406.03 A: yeah that's not 

407.57 409.60 A: bad but i guess like for 

409.67 420.35 A: you know in the like midwest in small towns where there's like nothing except factories and farms you know that's all that people have 

421.99 424.64 B: there's certainly not much to go around anyway 

423.55 428.72 A: yeah there's not and they're you know like especially in the economy right now there's like 

428.92 433.96 A: you know like i just applied for a real career job yesterday and they told me right up front 

433.99 438.64 A: it pays nothing but i don't care i just want a job [laughter] 

437.95 439.72 B: it pays what 

438.93 444.79 A: they're like it pays crappy they're like you can you know it it's not a good paying job 

445.28 447.40 B: what is it 

445.30 455.67 A: but it's um i'm a journalist and so it's it's a newspaper job but you know the economy right now sucks [laughter] so they're like 

448.34 449.54 B: okay 

454.98 459.95 B: but you're doing what you wanna do right but that's different that's different 

456.84 458.93 A: right doing what i wanna do 

459.37 461.55 A: yeah yeah it is different 

460.34 473.78 B: it's different when you wanna do what you want when you're doing what you wanna do and when you're doing what you have to do because if you if you have to get a job then you have to take whatever they give you it's gonna be a crappy job you're gonna hate it 

463.92 464.94 A: mhm 

466.38 467.63 A: have to do 

470.56 471.40 A: right 

473.76 481.20 B: but when you're doing what what you wanna do you don't care if you're doing it for free 'cause you wanna do it you know 

478.84 479.79 A: right 

479.86 480.92 A: that's true 

481.13 482.00 A: yeah 

482.22 488.50 B: 'cause like me i'm in i'm into um film production and i'm trying to go to school to the new york film academy

488.58 492.14 B: right and um if somebody offered me a job 

492.23 493.32 B: um 

493.61 502.65 B: grafting and just pulling wires across the street for a film job i'd do that in a second 'cause that's 

501.52 503.36 A: because that's what you want to do 

502.74 515.60 B: that's what i wanna do that's what i wanna get into but you know if somebody told me i could stand on an assembly line for eight hours a day nine ten hours a day doing nothing i'm gonna hate that 

504.08 504.81 A: right 

515.85 518.60 B: i'm not even gonna take it 

517.50 521.39 A: right and probably a lot of the time you don't care 

521.92 525.76 A: you know i don't care if they pay me ten dollars an hour i'm not gonna do that [laughter] 

525.98 527.73 B: [laughter] 

527.02 534.22 A: i mean but some people have absolutely no choice they have a family they need to support their family 

532.61 536.12 B: they need to support their family yeah

555.45 556.75 B: you gonna do 

557.23 561.75 A: and you know i guess you know the government thinks it's you know doing it's 

562.12 564.16 A: best but these are people who 

564.67 565.75 A: you know 

565.89 568.53 A: they don't they're not the ones who have to
