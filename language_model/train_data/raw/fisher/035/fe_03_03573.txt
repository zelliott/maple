21.96 25.43 B: no no same here same in philadelphia [sigh] 

25.28 26.49 A: yeah 

26.60 30.75 A: it's it's it's way too low it's r- it's ridiculous 

30.19 33.78 B: and besides most minimum wage jobs don't come with benefits either 

34.14 35.23 A: none 

34.99 35.97 B: so 

36.01 43.25 B: the it it is it's terrible well what's the what's the present minimum wage i'm i'm not even aware of that 

38.09 40.29 A: it is it's it's really bad 

42.63 46.02 A: i think it's five fifteen an hour 

45.56 48.16 B: [lipsmack] oh i thought that's what they said they were going to raise it to 

48.25 52.29 A: i think it's it's up to five fifteen an hour i do believe [noise] 

50.72 56.36 B: hm [lipsmack] well that hasn't changed much since i was back doing minimum wage stuff 

56.05 61.83 A: no it was four twenty five when i started out like uh thirteen fourteen years ago 

61.35 72.01 B: well i started out more like forty something years ago and it was a dollar or something but still the you know th- this is only five times that and everything else has gone up more than that 

64.48 66.95 A: [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] 

70.46 73.99 A: oh yeah it has terribly i mean 

74.38 78.89 A: here for a three bedroom apartment it's anywhere from eight fifty to a thousand dollars a month 

77.89 80.67 B: (( hm hm )) 

79.54 81.58 A: you can't make that on minimum wage 

81.81 88.65 B: [lipsmack] oh no no not y- you'd never you'd never get to see the inside of the apartment you'd be working the whole time 

84.35 86.45 A: not even with two people working 

87.06 87.86 A: no 

88.35 89.41 A: (( yeah )) 

88.87 99.72 B: and for a family it would be ridiculous [lipsmack] a- and families could do f- f- far better on welfare if if you know they were to continue it 

91.47 93.06 A: oh yeah yeah 

98.32 106.95 A: [noise] and this is that's why so many people are on welfare because of such low wages if they would raise [noise] the wages 

104.23 106.11 B: (( mhm )) 

107.30 110.56 A: people could get off welfare 'cause they could afford a place 

107.51 108.42 B: they would 

109.88 114.91 B: true be an- and be an incentive to be able to do better instead of worse [lipsmack] 

112.96 113.89 A: (( yeah )) 

114.30 126.00 A: well if i had to to if i had to work for minimum wage i wouldn't even want to work it's er really not worth it if you have children which i have school age children and time you pay a babysitter out of minimum wage it's just not worth it 

121.87 123.03 B: oh 

125.38 128.44 B: no because you pay the babysitter more than minimum wage 

127.95 128.94 A: yes 

129.01 135.56 B: well for one thing er it's got control of your most precious possessions [sigh] so how many kids [lipsmack] ooh

144.40 146.52 B: oh good 

145.19 146.38 A: so that's just 

146.41 152.55 A: i don't see how anybody anywhere lives off minimum wage i did it when i was younger but i was at home 

149.57 151.07 B: (( hm )) 

152.16 166.41 B: right l- live you live at home maybe maybe if they could p- could put an age a top age limit on the minimum wage you know for everybody under twenty one [sigh] something like that but when you're out on your own 

159.77 160.82 A: yeah 

163.23 164.17 A: yeah 

166.51 170.44 B: it it just doesn't c- no 

167.95 176.67 A: [noise] no it doesn't cut it you know some people just don't get the opportunity to get the education to get the better paying jobs so they're stuck in a minimum wage job 

176.37 178.28 B: (( mhm )) 

176.99 182.69 A: i mean i don't have nothing but a high school education and i just lucked up into the business i'm in 

182.44 183.55 B: (( hm )) 

183.00 185.53 A: or i would be making minimum wage 

184.91 191.92 B: [lipsmack] oh yeah i i don't have a college degree either and i lucked into the field it did very well for me what what's your business

195.19 196.15 A: yeah 

199.72 206.03 B: they change so much so fast i ended up out of a job about two years ago [laughter] but [sigh] 

202.32 203.38 A: oh yeah 

205.41 217.44 A: yeah i like computers too but they're just so complex and they're constantly changing if you're not get the time to sit there and get update update you're not you're gonna be stuck in a minimum wage job 'cause you don't 

210.91 212.18 B: (( right [noise] )) 

216.18 221.21 B: that's right and you have to go to school every two years to relearn everything you already knew [lipsmack] 

220.46 221.26 A: yeah 

221.32 222.93 B: and just 

221.32 225.43 A: and even and when you go to college too some of these jobs they don't want to pay you much an hour 

225.15 227.36 B: (( [lipsmack] oh right oh right er )) 

226.53 230.36 A: seven eight dollars tops and that ain't much above minimum wage 

229.52 233.29 B: mhm [lipsmack] and like i said with no benefits [laughter] [lipsmack] 

232.83 236.35 A: yeah i know i don't have any benefits in my job either but 

236.21 238.04 B: (( a- and there's y- )) 

237.07 239.73 A: i'm not on welfare [laughter] [laughter] 

238.11 244.14 B: yeah yeah and th- there's no incentive i don't think for the companies to 

244.94 246.03 B: (( to )) 

247.06 248.98 B: treat their employees any better 

248.72 249.65 A: no 

249.15 259.78 B: uh with the computers uh they're bringing people in from india and and indonesia and stuff like that saying that there's nobody in this country with the expertise that they need oh phooey you 

258.58 259.48 A: yeah 

259.99 263.36 B: know they just don't want to pay them anything 

261.51 268.00 A: they don't want to yeah that's right and it's like all of our stuff being shipped over there because it's cheaper no 

263.48 265.13 B: (( hm )) 

266.64 270.64 B: [lipsmack] right that's another thing all the insurance claims and 

268.77 274.96 A: but the american people are suffering because of it and they don't care 

272.42 274.91 B: mhm

279.36 280.44 A: oh yeah 

279.80 284.10 B: [laughter] but it's take a long time 

280.56 281.60 A: that's true 

284.35 299.00 A: because the poor are just getting poorer 'cause they're taking all the little jobs and shipping them out so therefore these people are just getting in the worse boat and they're on welfare and here we are paying taxes and and paying for them because they took their jobs away from them 

289.66 290.72 B: mhm 

298.22 301.44 B: [noise] [noise] right right and 

299.99 302.83 A: or don't pay them enough to support a family

394.29 395.94 B: um it's craziness 

394.43 396.37 A: (( you know it just makes no sense )) 

397.55 401.98 B: [lipsmack] it's um now that's interesting that it does tie in with minimum wage 

401.36 402.71 A: yeah 

402.18 403.33 B: (( hm )) 

403.82 413.71 B: and the d- the differences between um the c._e._o.s of the companies too and and the the workers that gap keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger [sigh] [lipsmack] 

413.28 419.19 A: yeah and also learn when you're working for somebody else you're making them rich but you're not getting anywhere 

418.88 420.85 B: that's right that's right [noise] 

420.24 427.38 A: you're you're not you're making minimum wage and they're they're living in fine mansions and you're just out of luck you know 

426.54 428.44 B: mhm

438.13 439.01 A: yeah 

439.13 440.14 A: they do 

440.99 454.47 A: and people in minimum wage jobs just don't have res- they're not respected and then they turn around they're not respected within the company because they're paid so low and they turn around and pass it on to the customers i mean 

450.66 452.58 B: mhm 

453.15 455.22 B: mhm 

454.39 461.42 A: like last night i was ordered a ice cream at sonic it took me forty five minutes to get it and i had to throw a fit to get it 

461.29 465.30 B: [lipsmack] oh my gosh saying so much for customer service you know [lipsmack] 

461.96 462.96 A: (( i know )) 

464.24 469.31 A: oh yeah i mean they they don't they're not paid much so they don't really care 

469.48 470.35 A: (( you know )) 

470.46 476.26 B: oh the owners of the company should just be around and watch that mhm hm no 

473.98 477.01 A: yeah they they don't care they're d- they're making money 

476.77 478.69 B: mhm 

477.29 482.32 A: well they didn't make any off mine 'cause they had to give me mine free 'cause i threw such a fit but [laughter] 

481.28 483.02 B: (( [laughter] mm [noise] )) 

483.17 489.35 A: but still you know nine times out of ten they treat their employees like they're nothing because they don't pay them nothing 

490.18 494.04 A: and expect uh for them to just smile and be happy 

492.80 495.63 B: mhm 

494.19 502.19 A: you know i've been in a minim- minimum wage job i made a hundred and eighty bucks a week trying to support a family my husband was going to school 

501.87 503.06 B: (( [lipsmack] wow )) 

502.48 506.68 A: it was just out of house mode and everything else it's just unreal 

506.59 507.66 B: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

507.59 513.31 A: and then he got a a good paying job and we moved now we both have good paying jobs but 

512.79 514.88 B: oh that's great 

515.80 522.24 A: i just couldn't fathom going back to minimum wage it took me a while i was up here about eight months before i found something 

518.35 520.36 B: no i couldn't 

522.23 522.79 B: (( mm )) 

522.93 532.31 A: that wasn't minimum wage 'cause if you can afford to pay childcare for that [noise] it wasn't worth it for me to go to [noise] work on minimum wage because of childcare yeah 

526.05 528.54 B: mhm 

532.24 536.07 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] well that's right that's right 

536.66 548.10 B: like i said it's you pay the childcare person more than what you would be making and you don't get much of it up here you don't you do get a slight discount for more than one kid in daycare but not much 

540.59 542.34 A: of course yes but 

546.83 547.74 A: yeah 

548.36 553.50 A: yeah well say even after d- afterschool care around here's like eighty bucks a week 

553.37 554.24 B: (( mm )) 

554.21 555.77 A: for two kids 

555.43 556.09 B: (( mm )) 

556.04 556.98 A: and that's 

557.07 560.83 A: half your paycheck for a few hours in the afternoon 

558.41 559.58 B: sure 

560.79 562.52 B: mhm 

561.80 562.78 A: (( you know )) 

562.53 566.19 B: well you wonder how old they have to be before they can stay by themselves oh 

565.70 568.51 A: yeah 'cause mine are nine and eleven 

568.57 575.12 A: and i think it's like thirteen they can legally start you know sitting other children so they're allowed to be by theirselves 

574.81 578.49 B: yeah but you still worry [laughter] 

577.34 579.05 A: oh yeah yeah 

579.00 579.91 B: (( [sigh] hm )) 

579.96 581.79 A: [noise] yeah it's ridiculous 

583.12 586.73 A: and then they've got these programmes that pay you know 

587.50 599.89 A: even these people that go to school that welf- you know welfare and all is paying for them to school even when they get out if that'll help them find a job they're still stuck they're stuck in a minimum wage job 'cause they don't have the incentive to go out and get a job after they graduate 

596.31 597.75 B: (( right and it is ))
