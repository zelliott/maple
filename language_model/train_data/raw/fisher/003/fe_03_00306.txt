0.23 1.53 B: hello 

0.97 2.68 A: hi [laughter] 

3.06 5.83 B: hi what do you think about airport ah secu- 

5.30 9.24 A: well first of all i'm just introducing myself my name is nadia and i'm from 

9.72 11.76 B: okay i'm adele i'm from 

11.91 13.77 B: cambridge massachusetts 

13.71 24.62 A: okay hi well i think that it's not going to like high security i don't think is going to decrease the risk of possible bombing or frightening situations 

25.20 27.47 A: i don't know what you think about it 

27.21 35.38 B: well i i i agree i think that if ah someone wants to ah bomb that they will manage to find a way 

35.33 36.49 A: yeah 

35.75 41.89 B: ah but it may ah stop ah some lesser types of crime 

40.34 51.83 A: right i don't know i'm from italy so i travel like at least once a year to go there and when i enter like italy i have totally no security controlling me 

46.21 46.83 B: (( yeah )) 

52.29 56.35 A: only once in germany they were like really controlling like my backpack 

56.40 64.85 A: and that was like the first time they were like also like put hands on me and control my pockets and whatever i had like in my backpack but otherwise 

56.41 57.39 B: uh-huh 

64.02 65.12 B: (( [noise] )) 

64.62 72.37 A: i could have like pretty much anything i mean i don't know like if a metal detector of course will detect like a bomb or something like that but 

73.08 74.49 A: i don't know that 

73.37 80.52 B: well i i think i've you know traveled ah as well though quite a few years ago oh 

80.57 83.41 B: and i don't know if if you ah 

83.63 89.56 B: are old enough or probably to remember that in when there was the ah 

89.68 94.16 B: there were some terrorist groups in italy ah the red brigade 

91.99 93.00 A: mhm 

94.21 95.21 A: right 

94.35 104.54 B: a- and so on and and were bombing ah um obviously at much lesser scale than ah what happened on september eleventh but it's at the airports 

102.48 103.43 A: right 

104.42 105.57 A: yeah 

104.78 111.52 B: the major airports in in italy and and germany for example was having trouble at that same time 

108.89 109.74 A: yeah 

111.71 114.63 B: um and so there were some 

114.70 115.78 B: um 

116.21 124.10 B: measures of security being done at that time but not certainly at the level that they're now now starting to do 

123.74 138.57 A: yeah well and i think also like today like it just depends who's working that day when i came back from italy in phoenix they were not like i was not checked at all 

135.16 135.99 B: uh-huh 

138.47 142.47 B: in going out of italy or in into phoenix either one 

141.36 144.64 A: coming into phoenix coming into the united states 

144.46 153.99 B: uh-huh well i think they it it's when you board the plane that they are supposed to do the security check ah other than 

153.74 156.12 A: well that makes sense 

155.75 159.55 B: but you where did you did you go through passport control in 

158.56 164.25 A: ah yeah that's where how it happened in germany and they had like kind of good controls there 

164.15 165.14 B: uh-huh 

165.14 173.37 A: but when i entered it was though they had no control at all and but when i left from the united states 

169.07 170.26 B: yeah 

173.40 178.77 A: either i was not really well controlled i think i mean they could have done more 

178.66 192.83 A: i think if they really wanted to check i know they try they look under my shoes something that they never done before and it seems that the metal detector was on a higher level because for instance like the buttons of my t shirt were beeping 

178.97 179.82 B: uh-huh 

180.15 181.03 B: uh-huh 

184.98 185.93 B: uh-huh 

192.10 192.96 B: right 

193.00 194.20 B: yeah [laughter] 

193.24 195.50 A: things that had never happened before [laughter] 

195.16 207.49 B: yeah they ah i ah went to atlanta about two weeks ago and i had taken the change out of my pocket you know in anticipation of the the machine but 

203.15 204.17 A: mhm 

207.34 210.86 B: i had left some um lifesavers 

210.65 211.72 A: mhm 

211.21 215.58 B: and the wrapping paper has is slightly metallic 

215.04 216.77 A: oh wow so it beeped 

215.83 220.74 B: and that set it off yeah and so they had then to do the the 

219.90 229.65 A: yeah yeah that i think it's higher and probably it's like better but i'm so sure that if someone wants to bring someone something on the plane 

224.26 225.31 B: yeah 

229.62 235.58 A: they're going to make it because i believe they're going to have some kind of connection with the people that work there 

229.91 230.87 B: uh-huh 

235.74 238.95 B: oh i think that's probably going to be the easiest way to do it they'll 

238.24 239.78 A: yeah i mean ah 

239.18 241.41 B: just get jobs there yeah 

240.89 250.69 A: yeah yeah like a totally fine person so no one knows your background you just study and you're fine and then at the right moment ten years from now you're going to do it again 

243.12 244.12 B: uh-huh 

250.89 252.57 B: yeah yeah well i 

251.38 253.74 A: like that's what i believe but [laughter] 

253.68 258.38 B: well i think you're right because i think that's how they were so successful the last time is because 

257.88 259.02 A: right 

258.55 261.49 B: majority of the people were living in this country 

261.62 266.93 B: and training for what they were doing right here they weren't coming in from elsewhere 

264.49 265.41 A: right 

265.96 269.98 A: i think they plan it like more than ten years ago that thing 

270.14 273.27 B: oh yeah absolutely yeah 

271.13 272.46 A: if not more 

272.89 281.53 A: and now they're planning something for the future and and would they say well maybe in a month we're going to bomb you again i don't think that's going to happen 

276.20 278.53 B: yeah yeah 

281.57 283.92 A: it's going to happen when they don't say anything 

281.87 282.97 B: well in 

283.79 298.49 B: or they're going to do something else because the free this isn't as big a concern out west because you know a lot of people take trains and subways and and such and and you know they're not heightening security on ah passenger trains 

285.21 286.59 A: oh yeah of course 

298.22 306.44 A: right i mean they just would like they were frightened of having put a bomb at in the university a couple of months ago or so 

299.17 300.62 B: you can hop on 

306.55 311.23 B: yeah and well and that's another another concern you know you could blow up 

309.50 312.92 A: (( yeah let's same security )) 

311.50 317.27 B: several thousand people at once [laughter] at at a university easily 

314.43 315.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

316.94 321.25 A: yeah and if it's a public place go to a library for instance 

317.41 318.96 B: (( mm because you know )) 

321.08 323.16 B: (( yeah or even )) 

321.40 323.21 A: and lots of public or 

323.71 331.01 B: you know ah residence hall dining room at the right time and and particularly high rise residence halls 

326.58 327.71 A: (( mhm )) 

330.79 331.81 A: yeah 

331.80 334.22 B: ah you know would kill thousands 

334.35 335.29 A: right 

334.60 337.47 B: of of students all at once and then 

336.48 339.13 A: well now i believe that the next ah 

339.44 344.56 A: day that they are afraid of passing through it's going to be like new year's day 

344.94 347.67 A: i think i don't know that's my suggestion 

347.76 349.34 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

348.19 354.06 A: like lot's of americans are going to say hey be careful that day something is going to happen just like 

353.03 355.70 B: well or or christmas too 

354.76 359.61 A: or christmas just like thanksgiving they were afraid of thanksgiving too but 

357.78 360.26 B: right right i 

360.09 361.47 A: i don't think so 

361.44 368.95 B: i i think that it- it'll be coming into or you know might be bio- biological you know you know 

367.33 370.98 A: yeah that's even worse so everyone suffers from it 

370.76 378.77 B: or something put into you know a river and and so it takes three months until everybody's sick you know 

374.20 375.06 A: yeah 

378.27 379.46 A: mhm 

379.26 383.26 B: it something you know the capabilities are endless 

383.24 384.37 A: yeah 

383.37 385.32 B: if somebody wants to 

384.77 387.29 A: especially when the mind is kind of sick 

387.57 395.42 B: yeah if you want to bad enough there's ah many ways now to particularly when ah you have a lot of money which 

389.85 390.77 A: yeah 

394.72 395.70 A: right 

395.89 397.83 B: which ah is the case 

398.24 399.48 A: yep 

399.82 412.05 A: well what do you think about the how the americans are responding to the threatening situation i mean not just besides putting high security in airplanes and but on the cities 

412.24 415.64 A: like all the all the talking we do on t._v. 

415.76 419.29 B: you mean like going into iraq and that kind of thing 

418.24 419.83 A: yeah i mean ah 

419.99 423.04 A: sometimes i have a feeling that we say too much 

423.69 428.77 B: well um yeah they for example they say the other night 

428.98 433.69 B: on the news that you know they caught you know a secret 

434.11 437.71 B: you know a shipment well it's not secret if it's on the news 

434.25 435.35 A: right 

437.35 446.56 A: right i mean why do you keep talking about it keep it like secret i mean because the other people like the iranian and all those people are going to listen to you 

442.03 443.09 B: yeah 

446.90 448.50 B: (( yeah )) 

446.99 451.18 A: so they're going to say oh you stupid americans that's what you found out it's not true 

450.43 451.28 B: well 

451.32 457.74 B: yeah well i think all the talk about war in the fall was election oriented 

457.58 458.48 A: yeah 

457.76 459.28 B: that did 

458.56 459.56 A: okay 

459.37 461.53 B: so people didn't talk about the economy 

461.37 462.43 A: right 

461.67 466.47 B: which would would have hurt you know ah bush and and his supporters 

466.50 467.41 A: right 

466.58 481.16 B: and so they got everybody scared and instead you know hysteri- comes he's hysterical about going to war then you're not going to worry about the economy and and you know now the election's passed they're slowing down and all of that and ah 

474.76 475.91 A: mhm 

479.81 480.77 A: [laughter] 

481.27 488.64 B: but i think you're right in that usually if you're going to go to war with somebody you don't alert them three months ahead that you're coming 

488.42 489.81 A: yeah 

489.13 496.49 B: you know usually historically people have been more successful if you showed up you know as a surprise [laughter] 

495.71 502.50 A: (( of course because you say oh in three months from now we're going to bomb that spot in that area )) 

502.30 504.08 B: yeah yeah 

502.70 505.42 A: huh good job [laughter] 

505.36 512.35 B: yeah and and i work with you know a a lot of of europeans ah here and ah 

512.41 518.88 B: you know it's it's like who are we to to tell other people to destroy their weapons when we have so many 

518.63 519.65 A: right 

519.49 521.51 B: (( you know it's ah )) 

519.81 527.22 A: i mean you should be the americans should be like the first and say okay we pulled down one gun now it's your turn to pull down another gun 

521.75 522.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

527.20 535.03 B: yeah it it's ah you know and not for us to say everybody but us you know get rid of get rid of your 

532.51 539.98 A: no yeah you cannot do that i see being too much like how do you say patriotistic 

535.42 536.28 B: (( weapons )) 

540.17 545.52 A: what you believe yeah you believe so much in your country so you're not going to quit 

540.44 542.32 B: a patriot patriotic 

546.13 548.48 B: yeah well i don't know i i don't 

548.52 551.45 A: i don't know this is like the first opinion i 

549.22 550.84 B: personally yeah 

551.96 554.73 A: i don't want to put it more stronger something 

555.00 561.38 B: well yeah and so many many americans you know they're just ah that's kind of been history that 

560.63 561.60 A: right 

561.71 566.97 B: we but you know to me whether or not you're willing just to run off to war isn't 

567.30 573.16 B: to me what makes you necessarily patriotic but that's a minor opinion 

573.03 574.16 A: mhm 

573.76 577.79 B: minority opinions i i think to most people it would be 

574.99 577.17 A: okay yeah you're right too 

577.88 580.91 B: you would do whatever the president says 

581.54 583.54 A: yeah go see if he's wrong 

582.48 583.25 B: and 

583.74 588.87 B: yeah whereas i think if you just agree it's more patriotic to make that known 

588.67 589.56 A: yeah 

589.10 592.23 B: because that means you care enough to want to change things 

592.41 595.27 A: yeah that's a perspective too yeah 

594.66 598.66 B: but i don't think that is the common american perspective i think 

598.35 599.28 A: okay 

599.15 602.08 B: that that's considered more liberal than 

600.57 601.38 A: yeah 

601.49 609.63 A: i don't know because in reality to tell you the truth i i'm not really following strictly what's going on both in terms of politics and war 

607.10 608.04 B: uh-huh 

609.55 610.56 B: uh-huh 

609.69 617.43 A: just because i've i mean war yes i realize it's there it's scary but it's not in my life now 

617.36 618.28 B: uh-huh 

617.82 622.07 A: so i already have enough trouble for me so i have to think about that one 

622.23 623.16 A: fine 

622.40 629.34 B: well i think that that's good because i you know like a lot of people are afraid to fly well you don't want to spend the rest of your life 

629.28 640.01 A: being afraid of or just like if every day i woke up and said oh my god where is the war what's going to happen today okay well i have to go to work and study every day what am i going to do now 

630.41 631.76 B: being afraid it's 

635.57 636.49 B: uh-huh 

638.75 639.74 B: exactly 

639.76 643.88 B: exactly yeah i agree and i you know i think you know you should travel you should do 

643.92 645.87 B: what you would do because if you 

644.81 648.53 A: yeah and whatever happens okay we will deal with it 

646.21 647.06 B: yeah 

648.43 653.72 B: yeah exactly because otherwise you're being a victim before there's anything to be a victim of 

653.32 654.37 A: right 

654.13 654.92 B: (( yeah )) 

655.00 657.35 B: so i i agree yeah 

656.47 657.88 A: yeah 

658.00 660.84 A: (( i don't know if i have anything else to say about it [laughter] )) 

660.84 664.63 B: yeah i don't know are we supposed to talk until something beeps or something 

663.96 666.13 A: ah is that the first time you do it 

665.78 666.79 B: yes 

666.39 677.00 A: me mine too but a friend of mine told me that in the last like thirty seconds the machine comes back and says you have thirty seconds to say hello to your partner 

671.88 672.78 B: uh-huh 

676.74 680.11 B: oh okay so we are good to go x. amount of time 

677.45 678.83 A: so that's sort of 

678.92 680.50 A: (( i think so )) 

680.15 682.47 B: yeah okay well we'll think of something to say 

682.20 695.43 A: something about frightening situations again oh something that really i don't like it it's like i used to travel with you know those small pocket knives just for like camping oh i cannot do it anymore 

692.15 694.11 B: oh yeah yeah uh-huh 

695.15 696.45 B: no you can't 

696.06 703.83 A: that's something that i don't like it's like something tiny come on who do you want to kill with that thing i want to cut my apple 

701.03 703.24 B: yeah well you can 

703.92 708.38 B: yeah but ah well and i usually do like needlepoint 

708.19 709.43 A: mhm 

708.83 711.32 B: ah and i can't carry scissors 

710.94 712.35 A: oh that one too 

712.27 717.03 B: yeah so and you can't carry knitting needles or anything like that so 

717.35 719.90 B: so you know you i and i don't like to
