59.30 60.09 A: um 

59.88 61.68 B: are you hearing a lot of noise on the line 

61.84 62.95 A: i am actually 

62.80 63.69 B: oh okay yeah 

63.90 64.48 B: oh well 

64.14 66.02 A: are you i'm on a cell phone but it doesn't seem 

65.53 68.89 B: oh no i'm on a land- i'm on a landline phone i think it's a long distance carrier but 

68.59 69.13 A: yeah yeah 

69.09 70.63 B: but anyway ah 

69.73 70.38 A: i i've 

70.81 72.23 B: you're a student where are you a student 

72.97 74.78 A: um at m._i._t. 

74.97 76.04 B: oh cool i'm in a 

76.40 78.55 B: i'm going to be transferring to berkeley in a couple 

78.78 79.85 B: couple of years i'm at 

79.99 80.30 B: i'm in 

80.51 81.30 B: close to bay area 

81.79 82.61 A: oh cool 

82.52 82.99 B: yeah 

82.73 84.20 A: um what are you gonna study 

84.74 87.97 B: i'm thinking probably electrical engineering or advertising 

88.14 95.74 A: oh [laugh] yeah um sure yeah i guess i don't know what would be good for an entrepreneur 

89.02 92.15 B: yeah very eh various things 

95.73 96.43 B: [laugh] yeah 

95.98 96.33 A: [breath] 

96.96 98.39 B: i mean hey you you you know 

99.14 104.93 B: advertising and you can you know start your own little advertising agency or you do electrical engineering and you can you know 

105.70 106.33 B: t- your own 

106.52 109.24 B: be th- this crazy crackpot inventor and 

109.43 112.67 B: sell your idea to millions and an- an eventually so [laugh] 

112.91 119.08 A: yeah i mean i guess the pr- the program i'm in has a very entrepreneurial attitude and a lot of people who finish the program 

119.49 119.87 A: end up 

120.67 122.86 A: you know trying to start a business or what have you but 

124.06 129.16 A: i don't know i mean it's a different market than is was a couple of years ago 

127.60 127.99 B: yeah 

129.97 130.85 A: i guess 

131.31 141.11 A: um i i guess i've been thinking you know once i graduate i i try to start my own business do some kind of consulting or if i ended with a good product idea seeing what i can do with that if i can get other people interested but 

139.86 140.24 B: mhm 

142.17 147.04 A: i don't i mean we'll see what happens when i actually get out [laugh] but ah 

144.93 145.47 B: yeah 

147.40 147.89 A: you know 

148.38 149.21 A: i imagine 

149.85 151.51 A: sort of so you're in the bay area 

150.60 151.32 B: [noise] 

151.74 152.14 B: yeah 

152.48 154.30 A: yeah so i imagine 

154.41 156.44 A: the the boston area has been pr- 

156.59 158.45 A: hit pretty hard and i imagine that 

157.88 161.92 B: it's what i've heard i have somebody who works worked for lucent in the boston area and they 

162.53 164.37 B: cut back the work force gigantically 

164.70 166.80 A: yeah (( )) really laid people off 

168.51 169.98 A: um so i guess 

170.58 173.24 A: the enthusiasm is not the same so i don't know 

173.49 173.87 B: yeah 

174.11 174.71 B: well i mean 

175.91 180.74 B: it it seems sort of strange because there are you know like there is this interesting dynamic between 

181.33 188.47 B: like you have all these you know like in the late nineties there were you know all these crazy interest companies that just sprung up out of nowhere and they had some of 

188.58 192.79 B: dumbest ideas you've ever heard of them and people threw money at these like there is no tomorrow and 

190.08 190.76 A: [laugh] 

193.62 205.21 B: and now you know oh there is has been this huge shake out and all the crazy ones have kind of gone by the waste side and the ones that are left are pretty solid reasonable businesses and yet there are still you know it still seems like 

205.34 206.13 B: you know there is this 

207.05 213.68 B: like repressed spirit of looking for something new and exciting and innovative because i mean look at this god-forsaken segway scooter thing 

213.90 214.56 B: which is a 

214.23 214.49 A: yes 

214.92 215.39 B: i mean ah 

215.05 215.41 A: yeah yeah 

215.85 219.60 B: it's i i saw i mean i heard the hype about this thing before 

219.74 222.36 B: probably half a decade already and 

221.70 222.26 A: right right right 

222.58 224.45 B: it's the most completely 

224.63 229.35 B: non interesting thing ever it's it's stupid electric scooter that costs too much 

229.69 230.16 A: [laugh] 

230.05 230.99 B: [noise] 

230.28 241.49 A: yeah and i guess you know so s- maybe there are some clever design things but do you know what do we really need something that's gonna keep us from walking is this really what this country needs right now [laugh] 

238.72 239.78 B: i know i mean like 

240.30 244.12 B: it's it's the dumbest idea because seriously you ah 

244.35 255.62 B: like a look at it and i think okay what is this good for it's good for people who want to like not actually get in a car like t- the kind of people who would ride a bike if they weren't so god damn lazy 

256.33 262.59 B: you know they they just like the (( )) la- sorry the lazy the elderly and the government there you go 

262.87 270.97 A: yeah well i guess i guess the post office is looking into it they have like in like florida or some place around there they have ah they are trying it out 

272.00 272.45 B: i mean 

272.01 274.92 A: the you know they are actually trying it out with postal workers 

274.52 276.23 B: yeah i mean yeah i i really don't 

276.54 277.85 B: think it's going to fly 

278.30 279.62 A: yeah 

279.77 283.44 A: yeah he came in he came in and i forgot what his name is now um 

283.75 285.39 A: (( came in dean came in )) 

285.12 285.56 B: mhm 

285.51 287.17 A: came in ah 

287.29 291.17 A: ta- spoke at our lab and he was just he was just very like he was a very 

291.33 295.24 A: inspiring speaker you know saying you should be working on important problems 

295.68 304.62 A: you know if you're an entrepreneur and if you're someone who is technically savvy you shouldn't be working on some stupid e. commerce application you should be working on 

305.12 308.37 A: something that solves social problems with you know 

308.52 309.54 A: technical 

309.82 311.38 A: technical solutions and e- 

311.48 312.17 A: but ah 

312.38 314.91 A: i didn't really think the scooter actually did that 

315.02 316.42 B: yeah it's it's like you know 

315.39 315.82 A: ah 

316.71 323.45 B: and th- we already have something that fills the niche you know those those stupid little aluminum scooters that you can by for like fifty nine dollars now 

323.80 324.93 A: yeah it's ridiculous 

324.10 328.99 B: and i mean the only difference there is you know you have to actually use your own energy 

329.42 329.92 A: yep 

329.51 330.60 B: so and 

331.07 338.87 B: it's fifty nine dollars for you have to push with your foot versus three f- three to five thousand dollars where you just kind of lean and it just seems like 

339.69 342.56 B: a a whole lot of flash and a whole lot of hype over 

342.92 346.85 B: the equivalent of of basically like a whole bunch of things that already exist 

347.27 351.96 B: it's not something totally revolutionary like the telephone was revolutionary when it was invented 

352.29 352.66 A: yep 

352.32 354.25 B: the segway scooter is not revolutionary 

354.62 354.96 A: yeah 

356.15 357.62 A: yeah i totally i totally i agree 

360.15 365.39 A: so so tell why it's advertising in electrical engineering because i really find that kind of fascinating 

365.71 366.43 B: well um 

365.90 366.25 A: as a 

366.56 377.28 B: i don't like i s- you know advertising there there is so much you can do with it because it it combines so many different art forms and so many different sciences right like there is the whole business of social science 

384.43 386.73 B: you know perceive different things and there of course there is 

387.11 391.29 B: the whole business of art and photography and there are so many angles you can take everything from 

391.94 392.43 B: i mean 

401.01 407.86 B: so i mean if the people with bad advertising can get clients then obv- then if someone can create really good advertising then 

404.31 405.00 A: [laugh] 

408.34 408.90 B: you know 

409.40 412.72 B: presumably there will you'll be able can get lots of clients and 

413.27 417.67 B: electrical engineering i don't know i mean i'm totally fascinated by the telephone network and the way it works 

418.07 419.35 B: and you know i've 

419.51 420.71 B: been doing kind of you know 

420.95 424.20 B: this free lance telephone wiring thing 

424.32 432.51 B: which is you know gotten me a little extra cash and so i figured there is somewhat of of a market for it and if nothing else you know there is always newer and smaller 

432.63 435.03 B: better devices being invented and suddenly you just 

435.63 437.61 B: probably for good electrical engineers 

438.87 439.26 A: yeah 

439.50 450.08 B: and if nothing else the electrical engineering end of it could probably ch- you know inventing some new electronic gizmo and the next thing you know i'll be the next person pitching the next dumb segway scootersque idea 

449.52 450.23 A: [laugh] 

450.64 453.31 A: [laugh] yeah it's just my it's maybe my goal i don't know 

453.60 454.74 A: it would be fun anyway 

454.87 455.63 B: what are you studying 

456.24 459.12 A: um i'm at the media lab which is like a 

457.60 457.89 B: [noise] 

459.41 464.43 A: kind of like a multi-disciplinary program focused on technology but different people kind of do different things 

461.61 462.02 B: mhm 

465.10 470.55 A: so there is anything from (( )) technology to people are going tangible interfaces to 

471.24 473.88 A: um what i'm doing which is more ah 

474.21 479.77 A: kind of looking at how people interact with tech- it's just it's basically psychology applied 

479.93 484.90 A: to the technical field so it's looking at how people interact with technology and how 

485.06 485.84 A: technology 

486.22 486.78 A: affects 

487.15 487.68 A: their lives 

488.01 494.62 B: i love looking at that like one of my favorite things to do is go down to the bart station in downtown san francisco during rush hour 

488.20 488.56 A: am 

493.54 493.88 A: ok 

494.87 498.31 B: during the afternoon and watch the people interact with the machinery 

495.02 495.36 A: uh-huh 

498.81 504.14 B: buying tickets going through the machines seeing what happens when th- they don't work correctly how people react to that 

500.14 500.63 A: yeah 

501.02 501.34 A: yeah 

504.86 506.57 B: it's utterly fascinating to me 

507.07 507.79 A: yeah and 

508.07 511.26 A: yeah and i usually assume that you know sort of something like that if if 

511.77 515.66 A: if a lot of people are not knowing how to use it's their my fault [laugh] i mean if 

516.23 516.61 A: eh 

516.92 518.16 A: i think a lot of things 

518.53 521.09 A: have been designed by a lot of 

521.26 524.44 A: technology we interact with it has been designed by 

526.06 532.30 A: by engineers not by designers or people who really things a little bit more deeply about how humans like to interact 

532.31 535.99 B: right and i mean there is so much bad interface design out there to i mean like 

536.43 539.01 B: one of my favorite things is i've got 

539.13 545.45 B: a whole bunch of old you know bell system cast tone desk telephones and rotary desk telephones telephones they were made you know twenty five 

545.61 549.42 B: to fifty years ago and i love the fact that they th- are incredibly 

549.76 553.17 B: there is the hand set and there is the twelve button and that's it 

550.14 550.46 A: yes 

553.71 557.10 B: there is no you know millions of buttons everywhere there is no 

557.23 557.53 B: you know 

557.98 562.40 B: billions of different options that you can set plug it in it rings you pick it up you make your call whatever 

562.63 562.99 A: yeah 

579.48 579.79 A: yeah
