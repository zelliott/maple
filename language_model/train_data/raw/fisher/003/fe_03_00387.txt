0.82 4.94 A: hi my name is suzanne i'm calling from portland oregon 

5.47 9.93 B: (( [noise] hello my name is scoon and i'm in san francisco california )) 

9.63 13.19 A: (( oh hi how are you doing )) 

11.15 11.96 B: [noise] 

12.60 14.31 B: (( good thanks how are you doing )) 

14.35 18.23 A: well it's raining here in portland as usual 

18.29 20.76 A: so um the topic 

21.09 23.62 A: i guess it's pretty timely 'cause 

24.02 30.16 A: at least here there's this huge um peace protest kind of thing going on this weekend 

30.09 31.64 B: (( [noise] which one is it that you )) 

30.55 32.59 A: i think that's happening at there too 

33.01 35.34 B: that's you're saying it's timely and 

35.41 36.45 A: yeah 

35.45 38.16 B: i feel that ah the 

38.45 44.98 B: not only the question about the role of the united states in the peace process but um the larger question will there ever be peace is 

45.85 50.03 B: um one that's been ongoing my entire life 

46.16 47.17 A: (( uh-huh well a )) 

50.27 63.26 B: and it's a um although i do feel that there will eventually be peace i don't think it's going to be any time soon and i don't think that the united states has the power or impartiality to 

63.40 64.46 B: effect it 

66.81 76.12 A: lot of that has to do i think with economic reasons because you know there's so much economic stake i think on 

77.03 79.12 A: american companies i guess 

79.32 81.78 A: in the middle east 

83.64 88.04 B: [noise] um yeah there is you're right not on- 

86.65 91.28 A: 'cause i don't think if it's say north korea i mean 

91.85 93.36 B: right you have t- 

91.96 95.30 A: north korea has no resources like oil so it's 

95.33 97.54 A: it's like back burner you know 

98.19 105.49 B: they had this um and even though the unites states is trying to calm down north korea with ah 

105.54 107.88 B: an economic stimulus package 

107.83 110.68 A: i i heard about that 

108.01 108.83 B: (( um )) 

109.96 113.43 B: g- they're um you're you're quite right there are a lot of um 

113.50 117.33 B: valuable resources in the middle east and american companies 

117.85 124.91 B: certainly have a lot of um [lipsmack] a lot of reasons to remain very involved [noise] there [noise] 

123.66 124.33 A: (( [noise] ah )) 

126.83 128.07 B: (( but ah )) 

126.90 133.88 A: but of course people are starving both in iraq and north korea i mean for a decade really 

134.22 136.42 B: oh yeah and i mean 

135.18 137.98 A: but they are treated differently 

139.32 144.83 B: well i i d- i i don't have a lot of faith in the united states to 

144.95 148.68 B: um bring peace mostly because i think the 

146.48 147.47 A: (( no [cough] )) 

148.99 153.49 B: the um world community no longer sees the united states as 

153.77 162.28 B: um an effective ah arbitrator and um thinks and i was travelling in europe recently and a lot of 

162.46 165.61 B: (( the editorials in the newspapers you know )) 

165.85 172.16 B: focused on whether or not the united states was being fair in its dealings with various parties 

172.72 177.71 B: (( and the consensus was that no the united states was not being fair )) 

178.57 181.80 B: and i i was kind of surprised to read that because 

182.03 187.19 B: (( ah having been in the united states for such a long time i [noise] [noise] )) 

185.64 189.31 A: yeah i think people are losing faith i guess you know 

189.86 191.98 A: and i guess also that ah 

192.55 195.61 A: you really have to be impartial 

195.96 199.75 A: to be somebody who can be a peacemaker 

202.08 205.89 B: that's also true yeah and 

204.61 208.18 A: and obviously we are not really impartial now [laughter] 

205.90 206.66 B: what 

208.77 211.03 B: no but i think it is important 

209.48 211.63 A: we're siding with somebody 

212.01 218.00 B: it is important to command respect ah amongst various parties if 

218.06 223.18 B: one is to bring about peace or any sort of meaningful dialogue 

223.23 224.90 A: yeah 

223.93 225.64 B: and 

226.16 233.40 B: (( [sigh] ah i i think that role belongs more to the u._n. than to the u._s. and either the u._n. is )) 

231.74 232.74 A: right 

233.44 239.95 B: um perceived as perhaps more slow and methodical and ah [lipsmack] 

239.53 245.62 A: yeah it's more deliberate even when it's not still you know it's not bar three 

247.14 253.43 A: if you come to think about how it operates and where it's coming from historically 

247.24 248.26 B: and 

250.80 251.38 B: (( yeah )) 

257.41 261.20 B: well do you feel that there will be peace in the middle east 

264.78 268.00 A: well i think as long as they 

269.01 269.64 A: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

270.74 278.86 A: they are willing to i guess accept differences you know like religious differences some of them obviously 

278.91 282.47 A: economic differences and all that 

281.76 283.57 B: mhm 

283.40 287.00 A: because it seems like they're a little bit more 

289.52 292.12 A: inflexible i guess you know [noise] 

293.38 297.00 A: because a lot of what they believe is really 

293.45 294.65 B: in what resp- 

298.14 301.25 A: what they call you know god's will whatever 

303.83 310.95 A: so it's like agree them or it just there could be there will be some kind of holy war or whatever you know 

313.74 319.35 A: and it seems like that doesn't happen here in the western world that much 

321.45 324.26 B: no here it's agree with us or it will be a 

321.49 322.61 A: 'cause like it's 

324.39 326.30 B: george bush's war 

325.86 331.34 A: [laughter] true yeah but at least we have at least more room for 

331.67 337.38 A: pluralism i guess you know the right to disagree i guess 

336.65 342.60 B: [noise] did you say that there was a um big um peace demonstration in portland [noise] [noise] 

343.49 349.17 A: [noise] um i heard it's going to be like the world wide events [sigh] 

349.25 354.97 B: yeah i think there's i remember yes that's right um the eighteenth i think 

350.04 351.37 A: this saturday 

354.35 356.06 A: yeah 

356.60 358.27 B: (( yeah there's certainly [noise] )) 

357.07 359.31 A: yeah portland has a big 

360.49 362.64 A: events like that all the time 

365.69 369.72 B: (( well there's going to be a big rally here in san francisco as well )) 

369.40 370.59 A: yeah 

380.91 381.48 A: (( [cough] )) 

380.94 384.92 B: i i i am worried that the united states will um 

385.14 386.85 B: (( act precipitously )) 

387.07 393.41 B: (( in the middle east and with the continuing build up of troops around the persian gulf )) 

387.20 388.29 A: yeah 

393.43 394.30 B: (( that )) 

393.69 394.54 A: (( [noise] )) 

394.64 399.83 B: it may trigger something bad i'm not sure what but either 

399.96 404.87 B: something harmful in that area perhaps repercussions in another part of the world 

405.18 414.97 A: [cough] and this time it seems like you know we're acting alone you know it's like maybe britain is supportive but n- nobody else 

405.84 406.65 B: and 

415.14 421.50 B: well britain has been a very strong ally of the united states in um since the ah gulf war 

421.62 423.45 B: way back ten years ago 

421.67 422.88 A: (( yeah [cough] mm )) 

423.55 434.43 B: [noise] and it's in that area the two countries have been working very assiduously together to ah ensure that iraq doesn't overstep the bounds of 

434.53 438.50 B: the ah u._n. disarmament that was put together 

438.75 440.14 B: in ninety one 

440.50 447.54 B: but it would be nice if there were more international support especially in europe where so many of our 

447.55 449.28 B: traditional allies are 

449.65 455.75 B: but um one one reads in the newspaper that turkey and saudi arabia are both hesitating 

450.01 451.65 A: right 

455.84 459.66 B: to ah share military bases with the united states 

459.79 467.18 B: but certainly it makes me pause and con- and reconsider whether um [lipsmack] our country's doing the right thing [noise] 

469.53 470.44 A: mhm 

469.57 475.07 B: i mean if turkey has also been a very strong ally of the united states in military operations in that area 

474.84 475.93 A: right 

475.16 477.62 B: and the united states was really pulling 

477.67 482.83 B: it was counting on turkey to support us ah in any 

483.04 485.61 B: (( operations we'd have in iraq )) 

486.15 487.03 B: so 

487.90 492.97 B: it it it's been making me think a lot about whether we're taking the right steps 

497.08 500.12 A: (( well hopefully this isn't )) 

500.38 502.58 A: a step i guess you know 

503.76 507.71 A: to the u._s. to separate itself from the world 

509.12 512.37 A: -s a lot of countries in history 

512.55 514.87 A: have got into the war like that [noise] 

518.28 521.48 A: like how japan went into um world war two 

521.99 523.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] that's a very good example i )) 

522.19 524.05 A: (( [cough] nineteen forties )) 

525.04 527.01 A: by isolating themselves 

529.46 533.45 B: think it might be very difficult for the united states to 

533.50 535.24 B: (( actually isolate itself )) 

535.69 537.02 B: because 

537.79 539.62 B: ah we're so tied up in 

539.84 542.31 B: trade with every nation and 

542.99 543.95 A: (( ay )) 

543.27 556.02 B: even if one or two countries like turkey decide that they want to separate themselves they're still very dependent upon the united states for so many things least of which is ah 

551.49 552.18 A: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

556.39 557.79 B: economic 

558.94 560.57 A: yeah 

562.17 564.82 B: (( or perhaps i should say not least of which is economic [noise] )) 

566.49 569.50 A: maybe all these things boils down to money though 

571.71 577.24 B: you think it's a money not not as much a issue as religion [noise] [noise] 

571.98 573.55 A: (( after all )) 

578.69 579.72 A: (( ay )) 

580.56 583.92 A: 'cause if the religion is the issue then 

584.04 589.73 A: saudi arabia for instance which is a very strong fundamental is- islamic nation 

593.70 597.87 A: yet they haven't really been attacked by the u._s. for instance you know 

598.53 599.34 B: (( that's true ))
