0.33 1.57 B: hi 

0.39 3.01 A: hello hi how are you [sigh] 

2.52 4.49 B: pretty good my name's abby 

4.18 6.33 A: hi abby my name is sheryl 

5.91 7.12 B: hi sheryl 

7.73 9.88 B: [sigh] so what type of business would you open [noise] 

9.99 17.81 A: um i would probably open a business that would involve um like ah custom tailoring and sewing 

17.69 18.78 B: oh 

17.91 24.07 A: i'm an avid sewer and ah although it's not what i do for um 

24.34 30.46 A: [lipsmack] for a career right now it's an interest of mine i'd love to turn that into a business what about you 

30.92 34.48 B: [sigh] oh i wouldn't be sewing [laughter] 

33.63 35.05 A: (( [laughter] okay )) 

34.59 36.12 B: [laughter] um [lipsmack] 

36.30 48.95 B: i don't know i i i've had a few um small businesses before i did some freelance ah bookkeeping and that was a wasn't a store front business i went from business to business and that was pretty satisfying 

48.70 49.57 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

49.17 56.18 B: and my brother owned a restaurant and i worked with him for a while and ah i might do that again but that has really bad hours 

55.91 62.38 A: [sigh] yeah um any business that i would open i'd i mean ideally i'd like to most of the work from home [sigh] 

62.02 63.06 B: (( mhm )) 

62.58 64.01 A: and um 

64.17 78.32 A: um some of the work um i'd like to have a website associated with it and this way i could do lots of um kind of um marketing but um without a whole lot of effort 

78.01 79.00 B: yeah 

78.57 80.03 A: and um 

80.32 85.46 A: i've seen some businesses that ah that seem to be successful 

85.47 87.49 A: um in that line and [noise] 

87.55 95.10 B: yeah you've wouldn't have to have too much overhead either it sounded would sound like because you could might do just customer order things to begin with 

94.71 101.43 A: right and you know i could um create something take a digital picture of it put it on the web 

101.50 102.60 A: um 

102.62 116.07 A: and then show it and explain it i've done lots of sewing most most of the sewing i've done um i like creating um you know the the soft sculpture bunnies and animals and dress them in period costumes and 

115.96 118.31 A: um i've had a lot of um 

118.55 132.55 A: rather rec- good reception as far as from different folks they'd say oh you ought to start a business and sell these and um 'cause i just do it for family and friends you know for birthdays holidays 

120.90 121.72 B: yeah 

126.94 128.00 B: (( mhm )) 

132.02 133.17 B: (( mhm )) 

133.08 146.09 A: but if i but if i didn't have um ah a regular job i would love to start a business that would involve as least something that i was interested in um from a hobby perspective 

145.72 152.42 B: [sigh] yeah that kind of sewing if you did that that product the nice thing about is that it doesn't have to fit 

152.47 158.89 B: you know having to um tailor it to somebody and have it be not quite right and then you'd have lost that investment 

152.84 153.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

158.96 163.41 A: right right and this would simply be someone would be able to see 

163.31 166.95 A: see the item say um maybe a little bit of history um 

166.83 180.16 A: i love to write a little and i could write a little history of um some of the um some of the items that i have made um i made a bunny and dressed her in like um she was dressed as lara from doctor zhivago 

179.38 181.27 B: oh nice 

180.33 194.22 A: you know and then another bunny i made for my mother she was dressed in a victorian costume that i kind of looked in at some period costumes and then came up with one that i could fashion and 

193.14 195.25 B: you just designed them yourself 

194.72 197.74 A: yeah i designed them myself and um 

197.75 203.18 A: so i was you know i was thinking this'd be great if i could do this [laughter] you know 

201.89 203.21 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

203.16 213.72 A: something that interests me something that i could do at my own time um and yet do like on a contract basis you know someone would want something specific 

213.56 214.65 B: yeah 

213.81 220.55 A: and i could you know design it and then see if it would meet a client's expectations and 

220.70 226.06 B: and you wouldn't would you consider doing things like craft fairs if you got extra made up ahead 

224.51 231.95 A: well you know no because so many people do them and lots of craft fairs items are um 

232.00 246.89 A: they're they're not that expensive you know anywhere from five to twenty dollars for an item and the the things that i have fashioned you know usually take me a full thirty hours to um to create and then sell 

234.10 235.03 B: yeah 

244.55 245.53 B: (( mhm )) 

246.90 253.92 A: and um you know that's almost like a week's worth of work and i couldn't sell it for twenty [laughter] dollars [laughter] 

251.98 254.56 B: [laughter] nope [laughter] 

254.46 260.78 A: so um and of course you know i um i'd i have to do lots of research about wha- you know mm 

260.82 263.68 A: if i was going to got that way there are some 

263.75 278.40 A: some juried art shows and some craft fairs that um that might support something like that um but they're d- they're in different parts of the country so i'd have to do some um demographic analysis first um 

266.98 267.91 B: (( mhm )) 

278.51 283.06 A: um creating the website isn't a problem i'm involved in a comp- 

283.12 285.89 A: computer industry anyway um 

285.26 286.25 B: mhm 

286.25 291.11 A: but um i've kind of you know toyed with the idea it's um 

291.45 297.10 A: it seems feasible um but of course starting any new business 

297.25 307.80 A: involves a a great deal of um a great deal of effort in the beginning [laughter] you know to get a business going and then um you need to actually make it um 

302.33 303.26 B: yeah 

308.14 312.50 A: make it so you know so that you have an income that would support 

312.54 314.64 A: you know support my efforts 

312.68 313.72 B: mhm 

314.53 326.57 B: it sounds like it's one that you could start [sigh] with um still keeping your current job um if you would if you knew that some time was coming up or you could devote extra time to it to get it off the ground 

326.11 327.35 A: right right 

326.76 330.33 B: and then slowly wean yourself off of your other job and 

330.43 340.08 A: right and i'm so risk averse i would have to do that you know i couldn't like [laughter] you know you can't just jump into it and say okay i'm going to try this now and see if it works so 

333.86 334.86 B: me too 

339.51 341.55 B: i'll quit my job ah 

341.03 351.85 A: [laughter] right it's not within the realm of of you know reality so um yeah i would do it concurrently and then see um oh well does it you know 

341.58 343.26 B: (( [laughter] )) 

346.19 346.98 B: uh-huh 

351.89 365.53 A: is it is it going to work is it ah is it something i could really devote you know full time to and would support me i mean you know lots of things go into that yeah i'd and that's what would make it hard because you'd still be working 

358.21 359.13 B: yeah 

365.29 368.70 B: mhm doing the two at once for a while would be hard 

365.98 366.79 A: (( you know )) 

367.95 374.71 A: yeah it sure would be so there's lots of considerations go into that [lipsmack] what about you mm 

374.85 377.80 B: well i i did like when i did the um 

377.57 383.72 B: [lipsmack] freelance bookkeeping and that really started with um helping out one person who was a mechanic who 

383.50 394.87 B: his business kept getting bigger and bigger and he needed somebody to help out and i would just [sigh] go to his business and um work a few hours there and then also take some home and i did his quarterly taxes and his 

394.83 403.01 B: um payroll and things like that and then i got another client word of mouth so that was pretty satisfying 'cause i like that um 

403.28 404.98 B: i like making things 

405.06 408.15 B: (( ah balance and i like ah )) 

408.28 410.00 B: the mathematics of it 

409.78 413.26 A: mhm is that associated with your current position 

410.23 411.05 B: so 

413.12 415.89 B: no [mn] right now i um [lipsmack] 

416.33 419.17 B: i'm bet- i'm in construction [laughter] 

418.69 419.94 A: oh uh-huh 

419.61 422.31 B: whole different field so um 

422.78 426.77 B: but it's nice to do the bookkeeping was nice because i got to 

427.10 441.59 B: ah set my own hours and accept clients that i wanted and um it was busy at certain times of the year when quarterly taxes were da- due and payroll and things like that but i loved being able to create my own hours and have extra time to do other things so 

435.87 437.01 A: (( [noise] [mn] mhm )) 

441.46 444.65 A: so wouldn't isn't that you know that's always i think 

444.85 449.96 A: an ideal you know to be able to have extra time to do those things that we would like to do 

449.70 450.59 B: uh-huh 

450.38 451.48 A: and ah 

451.56 452.87 A: instead of 

453.32 456.88 A: reporting to work to do something that is merely a job 

456.60 457.59 B: uh-huh 

457.73 461.13 B: yeah and i think that if it's your own business you're going to put in more time 

461.58 473.08 A: yeah um and yeah and from from other folks that i have known who have started their own business there is a lot of time involved in starting up 

462.16 463.37 B: (( to be successful )) 

473.00 487.13 A: and um there's lots of free courses to um i'm also a a college student a graduate student and um lots of business courses you know how to start your own small business and also small business administration 

483.59 484.68 B: mhm 

487.20 492.38 A: so there's lots of i i know there's information that would be easy to tap into 

492.44 493.42 A: um 

493.81 500.41 A: and also i've an undergraduate business degree so i could probably put that to use yea- [laughter] you know 

496.81 497.88 B: mhm 

499.66 502.96 B: yeah yeah at this point it sounds like you could 

502.56 516.80 A: yeah and ah i don't know though um it's it's a scary thing to you know i also hear of scary stories from folks who'd say oh i couldn't you know i couldn't imagine how much work that's really involved in having your own business or 

503.23 504.29 B: (( you just have to )) 

516.82 524.86 A: i'd have never gone into it it's so much easier just to work for someone else and get up report to work come home and then leave it behind you 

521.19 522.30 B: (( mm [sigh] )) 

524.94 533.03 A: and then um you know sole proprietors you know tend not to have to you don't have that luxury of leaving the business behind 

532.56 537.53 B: [noise] yeah they don't have vacation times and insurance and all the things that you get with a regular job 

537.30 548.71 A: right you take it home with them and um i've um been involved in a a residential remodelling we former husband and i had a small business and i did the bookkeeping for him 

548.17 549.04 B: uh-huh 

548.66 553.36 A: so i know what you're talking about as far as you know quarterly taxes so 

552.45 553.37 B: yeah 

553.65 558.95 A: and that kind of bookkeeping that goes along with the construction industry 

559.41 562.16 A: so lots of tedious work 

562.46 575.36 B: [laughter] yeah i guess you have to figure out um when you think it when you were mentioning those people that said they'd much rather work for a regular pay check i guess you have to figure out your own personality and figure out what's more satisfying to you the 

562.77 563.70 A: (( to do )) 

574.71 576.09 A: mhm 

575.51 580.66 B: risk that comes with not having that guaranteed paycheck and little bit less flexibility 

580.40 581.40 A: mhm 

581.06 581.88 B: um 

581.89 583.56 B: versus the other side [mn] 

583.46 597.23 A: yeah i think i don't know i think as we get older we maybe we're a bit more willing to take some of those risks because spending years in the work force you know you kind of begin to dream about oh wouldn't it be nice to have 

597.18 599.01 A: (( to work for myself instead of someone else )) 

598.24 599.92 B: [laughter] absolutely
