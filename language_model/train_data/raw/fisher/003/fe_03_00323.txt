0.93 2.94 B: hi my name is nadine 

2.60 5.38 A: hi nadine my name is lorraine how are you 

4.93 7.46 B: nice to meet you good good 

6.59 8.38 A: [laughter] 

8.17 14.25 B: um i guess we're just supposed to talk about this now just introduce ourselves and then talk about perjury 

13.96 15.11 A: exactly 

14.90 17.19 B: okay i guess um 

17.64 22.74 B: so i just had to look up what perjury means because i couldn't [laughter] what it meant 

21.57 23.14 A: (( [laughter] )) 

22.86 26.77 B: so i went to the dictionary i mean do you do you know what it means or could you 

25.89 30.52 A: well i think if you're you know in court and you're taking an oath you're supposed you're not supposed to lie 

30.11 31.31 B: exactly 

31.01 34.19 A: and ah if you do you're perjuring yourself 

34.53 38.79 B: so what do you think do you think you would ah do that for a friend or family member 

38.40 43.23 A: um that's really tough i mean i guess it depends on the 

43.81 47.07 A: severity of the issue i mean if i'm in court and 

47.19 51.18 A: you know i'm asked to take an oath i'd i'd like to say that i wouldn't 

51.38 53.11 A: um but 

53.21 61.99 A: if it's my best friend or my mother or my one of my sisters and i knew that you know in my heart of hearts they were- didn't mean to do anything wrong 

61.87 63.72 B: right right 

63.09 67.26 A: maybe i would i don't know i've never been in that situation before 

66.97 73.54 B: i know i know i haven't either i mean i'm thinking like it would probably be hardest if it was a child of yours 

73.22 75.35 A: mhm yeah 

73.61 77.37 B: you know because then you would feel like especially responsible for 

77.51 81.72 B: making sure that that child doesn't go go to jail or or worse 

81.65 91.79 A: that's true i mean i know in my day to day like little things i've said like little white lies and told people oh yeah i love your outfit when i think it looks absolutely awful 

90.15 95.24 B: [laughter] i know what you're talking about 

93.90 98.30 A: (( [laughter] but does that count [laughter] )) 

95.38 105.84 B: no i don't think that counts [laughter] um yeah i've done the same you know or at least like if someone asks you a question like do i look fat or 

104.95 105.87 A: mhm 

105.78 111.87 B: you know whatever i mean usually i'll try to like do what i can not to hurt their feelings or 

111.61 118.56 A: [mn] both of my sisters are overweight and they always ask me do i look fat in this like why are you asking me that 

115.90 128.65 B: [laughter] i know i know i have a few friends like that too and personally i just went up a jeans size recently like over the last like six months so um 

124.94 125.84 A: mhm 

128.06 130.65 A: it's wintertime it's okay [laughter] 

129.33 132.23 B: (( [laughter] i guess so but )) 

131.45 132.99 A: it always happens 

132.95 145.18 B: i just hope it doesn't go up another size [laughter] now that it's christmastime i'll have to be really careful about that but um so of course then you know i have to quiz my boyfriend all the time you know 

134.80 136.79 A: [laughter] 

139.09 140.02 A: (( mm )) 

145.10 149.73 B: are you sure that you haven't noticed anything and and see if ah 

149.87 157.14 B: but you know he's very good if he's like probably committing perjury everytime he tells me this but i don't mind you know [laughter] 

153.40 159.15 A: [laughter] [laughter] sometimes you just need to be told what you want to hear 

158.65 161.57 B: exactly exactly there's nothing wrong with that 

161.97 167.33 B: so what else are we supposed to talk about can we just are we just chatting for like ten minutes i had a friend that did this 

166.97 172.76 A: mhm i i think what you're supposed to talk about the topic that they gave us so that 

171.83 172.69 B: okay 

173.22 176.38 A: i assume so they can get as much um 

176.73 179.66 A: language that we use about that particular topic 

176.75 177.59 B: of our 

178.97 181.12 B: yeah how did you hear about this study 

180.95 188.83 A: well i actually um work for a publishing company that deals with reference products and language products and stuff like that 

189.13 195.38 A: and ah that's how we got interested in it so we all ended up signing up thought that it would be really exciting to contribute 

194.96 196.09 B: (( [cough] yeah )) 

195.45 197.94 A: and ah this is actually my very first call 

197.62 199.45 B: oh me too too 

198.43 200.42 A: and i just walked in the door [laughter] 

199.97 202.83 B: yeah i i just got home like twenty minutes ago 

202.39 203.31 A: uh-huh 

202.89 207.62 B: and i got first a call and then th- the um machine actually hung up 

207.25 208.34 A: mhm 

207.72 211.21 B: and then i guess and then it called right back and i was like oh cool you know 

210.92 211.83 A: mhm 

211.44 212.70 B: (( um so )) 

213.09 216.77 B: i'm trying to think of what else we can talk about with perjury um 

216.69 217.86 A: (( ah )) 

218.79 220.86 B: i'm trying to think if there's any ah um 

221.67 223.74 A: maybe we should make up a scenario 

223.45 225.10 B: okay okay 

224.19 228.37 A: and pretend you know as if we're in court and see what you would actually do 

228.19 230.09 B: okay okay 

230.00 233.97 A: all right since it's my idea maybe i should make something up [laughter] 

231.98 233.82 B: [laughter] 

234.23 235.70 A: um 

236.55 238.34 A: all right here's a good case 

237.86 238.63 B: okay 

238.41 242.28 A: um i cannot stand my best friend's boyfriend 

242.79 245.21 B: oh that's typical 

242.88 255.14 A: yeah i am at all he's a terrible person he's an absolutely terrible person it's not just because you know we've been best friends for over a decade and nobody's good enough for her that's not it i mean he's a really really terrible person 

255.01 256.01 B: yeah 

255.20 258.22 A: so i always imagine myself like you know 

258.68 263.67 A: i don't know making sure that he disappears from the face of the earth and things like that 

262.51 263.34 B: right 

263.77 266.50 A: so let's pretend you know for the sake of the discussion 

267.34 272.28 A: that you know he did disappear and i knew about his whereabouts and 

272.80 280.88 A: you know i had a discussion with him and i told him never to contact you know my best friend again and la la la and i made him feel extremely guilty so he didn't 

281.38 282.42 A: and 

282.43 287.37 A: you know my best friend hasn't heard from him in days and she asks me what's going on 

288.32 289.23 B: hm 

289.73 298.63 A: she has like this strange inkling that i may know what's going on i haven't talked to her in a long time about the relationship between her and you know her boyfriend he's just taken off 

298.92 302.73 A: they didn't have an argument nothing happened what do i say to her 

302.84 304.09 B: you know what 

303.05 305.16 A: and i'm starting to feel a little guilty 

304.83 306.78 B: right of course you know what 

306.85 312.71 B: if he's really that terrible like if it's no i'm serious like if it's not just because you're 

308.94 310.42 A: [laughter] 

312.80 319.07 B: you know you were jealous of their relationship um because i know how it is when you have a friend of yours i had 

315.00 315.99 A: mhm 

318.89 328.91 B: a friend of mine that was dating a very horrible i mean i i hated him i mean they got a puppy together he was abusive to the dog it was very upsetting she was a friend of mine forever 

322.85 323.77 A: mhm 

326.00 326.80 A: oh 

329.22 330.76 B: and she actually ah 

330.91 337.19 B: she ended up marrying him and and they have a ten month old and he just walked out like three months ago for no reason 

337.44 338.58 B: (( so )) 

337.55 339.57 A: i'm not surprised 

338.94 340.70 B: yeah so maybe 

339.76 349.47 A: it's kind of like something this guy would do like he's gone away for days not called her not said where he is and then later on shows up totally apologetic and she just takes him back 

341.74 342.57 B: yeah 

349.04 354.87 B: you know i as far as i'm concerned if you were to do something like that for her then that would be a good thing 

354.92 355.73 B: you know 

355.01 356.44 A: i think so too 

356.14 366.14 B: you know get rid of him get him out of the picture unfortunately though you know how it is i mean like it it takes two to have an abusive relationship or to have a bad relationship so they're both like 

357.42 359.05 A: [laughter] 

364.73 365.64 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

366.10 372.99 B: they're both coming back i'm a psychologist they're both coming for something you know they're both getting something out of it 

368.21 370.17 A: mhm [laughter] 

372.66 373.73 A: mhm 

373.15 375.45 B: (( out of that relationship so )) 

374.88 380.88 A: i think i would feel so guilty b- i mean because we've been best friends for thirteen years i mean how could i 

380.99 383.00 A: be so dishonest with her 

383.39 385.91 A: and is it going to come to bite me in the end 

383.60 384.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

385.98 387.70 B: well it's not like you killed him 

387.46 388.10 A: (( no )) 

387.99 388.89 B: (( you know )) 

389.31 390.28 A: no 

389.35 394.18 B: what i mean you just killed the relationship and maybe that's a good thing i mean 

392.33 393.32 A: yeah 

394.28 403.35 B: the the relationship will come back to bite her in the end it's not like if somebody is like you know got a commitment problem that it's like a little light switch they can just turn off and on 

397.20 398.17 A: mhm 

402.68 407.24 A: yeah and they have a daughter together they're not married but you know they have a daughter and 

406.64 412.25 B: yes yeah well then that that's tough then you really you then 

407.85 410.02 A: (( he's just a really bad partner )) 

412.33 414.47 B: (( then hm )) 

414.84 419.87 B: because once kids are involved then things get a little more tricky you know because you really 

417.77 418.70 A: mhm 

420.64 422.74 B: (( you know you don't want to break up the family )) 

422.31 423.36 A: mhm 

422.77 425.40 B: however she could always find another nice guy 

425.58 426.80 A: i think so 

426.85 429.52 A: (( [mn] i don't know it's a tough call i i )) 

427.04 428.12 B: you know 

429.59 433.82 A: really don't know what i would do in that situation like sometimes i'd like just 

433.85 441.77 A: call him up i mean i'm not close with him at all obviously and none of our circle of friends are nobody likes him her family doesn't like him nobody and 

441.68 449.97 A: sometimes i feel like calling him up and saying you know what's going on with you how could you how could you do this to her like how could you be so selfish and 

449.87 458.12 B: you know what he would do he would get all angry at you on the phone he would tell her and then your friendship with her would be temporarily over 

453.50 454.41 A: mhm 

458.27 463.28 A: yeah but i feel like i mean he has to be like human in someway that i could talk to him and then 

458.76 459.59 B: you know what 

463.55 471.35 A: i don't know trigger some kind of forcing him to like think about the relationship think about what he's doing to her and like get up and 

471.51 473.47 A: take care of his own life and leave 

472.86 477.88 B: you know lorraine he sounds like he just doesn't care you know and also 

476.13 477.03 A: mhm 

477.84 490.74 B: sometimes some people like like maybe that's all he has to give like maybe he really is like doing the best that he knows how to do i mean like i don't know if you know anything about his like background or his upbringing or anything like that 

483.66 484.50 A: yeah 

489.71 494.31 A: yeah his father was an alcoholic his parents divorced when they young i mean 

493.23 500.36 B: okay so he doesn't even know how to like having a loving like he's never had any kind of model of what a loving relationship is or 

498.09 498.96 A: mhm 

499.76 508.43 A: i don't think that's good enough though [laughter] like too bad for him because they've tried for three years and she's done bent over backwards for the guy and everything 

501.60 503.17 B: no i agree 

508.20 514.68 B: yeah yeah that's that's just that's very sad especially like i said when kids are involved because it's it's not 

511.71 512.60 A: yeah 

513.84 515.06 A: exactly 

514.69 516.49 B: as ah cut and dry 

516.26 518.59 A: (( exactly and i feel like in that situation that i )) 

518.88 520.88 A: maybe i would be able to lie about it 

521.08 523.74 B: yeah it would just be nice if he really went away for 

523.20 524.11 A: (( [laughter] )) 

524.37 528.78 A: without my having anything to do with it [laughter] 

524.57 525.34 B: (( good [laughter] )) 

526.71 527.87 B: yeah 

527.94 534.51 B: yeah because he probably wouldn't he'd probably come back around and you know try to ruin your friendship with her 

534.55 538.06 B: and it sounds like you're like such a strong connection for her 

534.57 535.87 A: i wouldn't doubt it 

538.08 546.55 B: you know like you're a really good support it sounds like to me at least from even the fact that you would bring this up on this conversation [laughter] 

538.10 538.99 A: yeah 

545.53 552.06 A: oh oh we've been friends since high school like i went on you know family vacations with her and you know her parents and things like that we're very very close 

546.98 547.89 B: yeah 

551.57 552.67 B: yeah 

553.08 553.67 A: (( yeah )) 

553.69 555.51 B: yeah it's very tough 

555.81 563.40 B: um i i don't even know i mean i i think that in those kinds of cases if if you're if you have to lie 

563.65 566.33 B: to get rid of him or get rid of whatever 

564.67 567.40 A: mhm for the greater good you do it 

566.64 569.34 B: exactly [cough] exactly 

567.79 568.80 A: mhm 

569.47 570.99 B: um and she 

570.35 579.99 A: i feel kind of guilty saying that on the phone you know that this is being recorded and people are going to listen to it later on and they're going to hear that you know what if we really had to we would do it [laughter] 

579.17 580.14 B: [laughter] 

581.67 587.76 A: it's okay to say it to a stranger but then to know that later on people are going to listen it'll be like wow those girls are bad 

587.52 599.10 B: oh i don't think so i don't think so everyone has been you know everyone would do the same thing i'm sure when it's when you really care about somebody and you really like had their best interests at heart 

588.63 590.05 A: [laughter] 

593.35 594.42 A: mhm 

595.89 596.83 A: mhm 

598.77 601.93 A: (( yeah and i guess of course it always depends on the situation )) 

602.08 608.51 B: yeah yeah that's that's true i mean i'm trying to think of a situation where i would definitely 

608.52 611.04 B: commit perjury um 

611.85 615.04 B: i mean i have a little brother that's had like a lot of ah 

615.08 623.99 B: he's had some run ins with the law but over like the stupidest things like he got arrested for having a fake i._d. my parents had to bail him out of jail 

619.31 620.40 A: mhm 

622.98 626.49 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

624.15 636.84 B: okay like if if if you can get arrested if it's the stupidest thing that you could possibly get arrested for he'll get arrested for it i mean it's just so outrageous um he also lives in like a town where 

631.47 632.46 A: uh-huh 

633.48 634.71 A: (( [laughter] )) 

636.85 638.90 B: there's not a lot of crime 

638.87 639.89 A: mhm 

639.30 648.68 B: it's ah you know a very small town and so the cops just kind of come out of the woodwork and they're just like they want to bust these young guys for like just crazy things 

648.02 649.78 A: because they have nothing better to do 

649.29 656.29 B: [cough] exactly so if they put me on the stand about some of this stuff that he's gotten arrested for i would i would lie for him 

650.33 651.21 A: yeah 

652.04 653.06 A: mhm 

656.14 659.26 A: mhm because you know it's all silly and that he has a good heart 

656.66 657.70 B: because i would 

659.17 665.10 B: yeah and i would just be like why are you wasting tax payers' dollars who cares if this person has a fake i._d. 

664.80 665.92 A: yeah 

665.32 675.34 B: you know i mean to me if you're eighteen i think you should be allowed to drink in this country i don't [cough] i don't understand the big deal it's like you can go off and fight in a war 

672.96 673.79 A: mhm 

675.76 682.32 B: and and get killed but i mean if you're if you are graduated from colle- or high school and you don't have to continue 

675.84 676.89 A: mhm 

682.70 686.05 B: anymore of your education like you should just be allo- i mean you're an adult 

685.89 686.69 A: yeah 

686.55 688.75 B: i don't understand what the big hangup is 

688.94 689.82 A: that's true 

689.18 691.74 B: i mean drinking and driving is completely different 

691.35 692.24 A: mhm 

691.76 696.52 B: you know that's that's a completely different issue but i mean he's never been arrested for anything like that but 

696.35 697.27 A: mhm 

697.32 702.85 B: you know so then i would lie so [laughter] or commit perjury i suppose is the 

701.02 706.70 A: [laughter] [laughter] perjure yourself [laughter] but 

702.95 703.96 B: the 

704.28 707.01 B: yes exactly exactly 

707.40 712.49 A: then there's also consequences that that you may have to suffer your lie could be found out 

712.53 713.53 A: and then what 

713.22 715.12 B: yeah that's true 

714.59 716.52 A: you get thrown out of court or 

716.61 718.43 A: you get arrested yourself 

717.08 719.89 B: what happens yeah what happens if you commit perjury
