17.14 17.68 B: uh-huh 

19.46 20.24 A: i am 

21.02 23.42 A: kind of running my own business right now 

23.57 24.18 B: okay 

24.30 25.34 A: what are you doing 

25.65 28.49 B: um i'm a p._h._d. student here in arizona 

28.62 29.53 A: okay 

29.85 33.08 B: not in the business world at all even though that's what i came from 

32.83 35.54 A: so you went back to 

34.55 38.22 B: so and assuming if you would start your own business it would be a graphics design business 

38.61 41.32 A: well either that or um 

41.99 43.95 A: an art gallery because actually 

44.20 44.61 A: by 

45.40 47.71 A: by birth i'm a fine artist 

47.80 48.28 B: uh-huh 

48.84 49.79 A: and 

49.94 50.72 A: i think 

51.32 52.96 A: that would be where my passion lies 

53.88 54.32 B: mhm 

54.47 55.15 A: so 

56.26 56.66 A: i wouldn't 

56.99 61.64 A: i'm not sure how i go about doing it because i don't come from 

62.50 63.00 A: really 

63.28 65.56 A: (( entrepreneurialship )) in the sense of 

66.30 67.35 A: having a fine 

67.47 68.35 A: base and 

68.56 69.61 B: money 

69.52 73.11 A: money i guess they said if money is not an object 

74.03 74.52 A: um 

74.04 76.69 B: so we get the big donation form some one 

76.52 81.41 A: yeah someone would say oh you're so fabulous here's some money 

80.66 83.80 B: do think though they would have the market for it or would you have to relocate 

84.61 87.45 A: boulder has a pretty good market um 

87.97 90.44 A: and there are severally really successful galleries here 

91.34 92.09 A: um 

93.14 95.23 A: i don't know which direction i would go because 

95.80 96.54 A: there are 

97.50 102.88 A: there are galleries run by young women here that have just opened and it's a more it's a younger crowd 

103.71 105.08 A: and i'm twenty eight 

106.14 106.75 A: um 

106.92 107.71 B: so they are 

108.74 109.57 B: early twenties 

110.16 115.71 A: they're probably oh no i'm not sure i think they are in their twenties i'm just thinking that niche is already filled 

113.41 113.83 B: okay 

115.91 116.47 B: oh okay 

116.74 120.92 A: so i'm not sure and we have lots of arts and craft type places 

121.48 123.68 A: and then we have really high end galleries 

124.65 125.20 A: um 

125.89 127.16 B: didn't think that would of boulder 

127.72 128.15 A: well 

128.26 128.66 A: there 

129.72 133.19 A: you'd be surprised there are so many people coming out of the university with 

134.06 138.44 A: degrees and what not and wide up making lots of money and then stay here and 

138.99 139.32 B: huh 

139.04 139.58 A: are quite 

139.88 140.87 A: educated and 

141.71 142.42 A: into the arts 

142.69 143.21 A: um 

145.17 145.56 A: so 

145.37 147.49 B: so you could open it up there that's pretty good 

147.71 148.36 A: yeah 

148.64 149.21 A: yeah 

149.73 151.93 B: and what are you doing with your graphic design business 

152.50 152.98 A: well 

153.15 155.25 A: i'm free lancing for mostly 

155.43 157.01 A: um clients that i know 

157.20 157.76 B: mhm 

157.43 159.10 A: because i was laid off 

159.20 160.23 A: surprise surprise 

160.88 162.94 A: and so i just decided well 

163.36 164.82 A: let me do this in the mean time 

166.41 166.99 A: and 

166.58 169.54 B: so what do you do are you more advertisement side 

169.95 171.17 B: logos and 

171.68 173.20 A: logos mainly 

173.44 175.14 A: i do do some marketing 

175.78 176.52 A: and so 

176.91 180.06 A: over head is nothing because i have my computer at home and 

180.54 181.67 A: you know most of my 

182.12 185.96 A: most of my clients are word of mouth actually all of them are word of mouth 

184.35 184.98 B: mhm 

186.59 187.25 A: um 

188.12 188.66 A: and 

188.89 190.66 A: i have everything i need really 

191.33 192.78 A: to do what i have to do 

194.51 195.11 A: um 

196.15 199.27 B: that's good because equipment is expensive for graphic design 

199.41 200.00 A: it is 

200.13 202.78 B: my father is a graphic designer 

202.61 203.40 A: oh really 

203.62 204.29 B: yeah 

206.38 208.62 B: yeah so i grew up with uh 

207.40 207.96 A: s now 

209.05 211.22 B: with these self employed 

211.59 212.05 B: person 

212.69 217.62 B: so that's actually why i don't think i would ever really want to open up my own business 

218.40 222.75 B: because i know it's just such an unreliable thing 

223.30 227.88 A: well it isn't reliable except other one thing i love about it is the freedom 

228.19 228.68 B: yeah 

228.88 229.43 A: because 

229.56 231.12 A: like this morning i got up and 

231.45 234.81 A: i have a friend who's a massage therapist and she makes her own hours so 

235.38 237.98 A: we just met and went for an hour long hike and 

238.36 238.93 B: mhm 

238.78 239.27 A: no 

239.75 241.38 A: you can't do that when you're working 

241.76 242.49 A: for someone else 

242.80 245.17 A: unless their really really flexible with your time 

246.20 247.53 B: yeah that's right i mean i 

246.31 246.82 A: um 

247.83 250.59 B: i like doing consulting work and and of course 

251.07 251.55 B: the 

252.30 254.88 B: the end goal is being a university professor where 

255.06 259.24 B: you're pretty flexible too i mean within certain realms but you're pretty flexible 

259.31 259.91 A: mhm 

260.59 264.53 B: but i guess if i were if i were to open a business i would probably 

264.79 265.41 B: help 

265.63 268.68 B: my boyfriend open up his business which would be 

268.78 269.24 B: um 

269.50 270.51 B: a tree company 

271.71 272.71 A: a tree company 

272.74 276.26 B: uh-huh he does completely different work then i do 

276.01 277.98 A: oh wow so actually goes and 

278.29 278.86 A: selling 

279.21 280.48 A: selling trees or 

280.01 281.92 B: no pruning them and climbing them 

282.10 282.99 A: oh my goodness 

284.63 286.37 A: i've heard that that's kind of dangerous 

286.92 288.17 B: yeah it's i mean it's 

288.60 289.77 B: so that was fun but 

291.16 295.10 B: at least so he says not hat i know that's what he claims though 

295.61 296.06 B: um 

296.53 300.29 B: here in tucson there is actually quite a lot of rich people you could 

300.67 301.54 B: market 

301.93 302.94 B: special pruning 

303.92 305.94 B: but you would need actually to find access 

306.04 308.83 B: to them and that would probably be the key problem 

309.70 311.71 B: since their closed of in their foot hills 

311.83 314.68 B: and their gated communities and finding access would be 

313.25 313.98 A: uh-huh 

315.64 317.01 B: the issue at stake 

316.98 317.65 A: wow 

318.50 321.91 B: so then it would just be a matter of getting the right equipment and 

323.02 323.77 B: and um 

324.15 325.04 B: once you're in 

325.54 327.70 B: i think it could be a pretty big business 

327.80 328.75 B: have to purchase it 

329.37 331.77 B: the tipper and the big truck 

332.30 334.02 B: the ropes and what ever else 

335.53 336.83 A: see i think that would be 

337.35 339.60 A: another kind of business where word of mouth would be 

340.10 341.42 A: would benefit him 

341.74 343.63 A: and that once you know once he 

341.75 342.73 B: definitely 

343.90 345.09 A: does one person's 

345.92 346.73 A: property 

347.08 351.09 A: and he does a good job then they'll tell their friends who are probably most likely 

351.32 353.12 A: wealthy and have lots of trees 

353.27 354.81 B: exactly then and that's 

354.94 358.00 B: we we live in oregon before and that's how we did it in oregon 

358.90 361.37 B: (( )) actually was working for himself but 

361.83 363.25 B: here it's really hard 

363.65 364.50 B: since there's such 

365.38 365.93 B: there's such 

366.10 367.34 B: segregation of 

367.58 371.50 B: of social classes it's really hard to get in contact with them 

371.89 372.60 A: really 

371.97 373.98 B: with the rich people on the hill so 

374.85 379.44 B: once you're um you're in but the getting in is the really challenging portion 

380.66 381.22 A: me me 

380.80 387.75 B: because i have a lot of other friends who have their own businesses massage therapy one person does hair one person does nails 

388.27 391.05 B: all of these people that are my neighbors here 

391.45 391.99 B: and 

392.49 395.64 B: they have a really hard time getting into the hills once you're in 

395.75 396.29 B: you're in 

398.06 398.52 A: no 

398.18 399.47 B: provided you're doing a good job 

399.64 401.62 A: yeah are their maybe like 

402.25 403.59 A: certain shops that these 

404.12 404.48 A: folks 

405.21 406.31 A: frequent and 

406.59 408.25 A: places that you could market 

406.87 410.33 B: i think probably the golf course would be 

410.42 411.30 A: mm 

410.64 412.47 B: you know being in the right golf club 

412.70 415.01 B: figuring in which one they're in and then 

416.57 417.72 B: doing the 

418.01 420.00 B: putting the money out to be there 

421.09 424.43 B: my dog is getting crazy with his chew toy 

423.94 427.09 A: i thought i heard squeaking i thought it was a bird 

426.00 429.93 B: yeah it's a squeaky toy it's his favorite toy 

429.71 431.02 A: that's so cute 

431.68 435.88 B: like let me show you what i can do because you're talking on the phone and i don't like it 

437.12 438.15 B: it's like a little kid 

439.36 444.59 B: you know how little kids walk up to you and want to tell you this really important story just after the phone rings 

445.30 445.96 A: oh yeah 

446.17 448.99 B: and they just remember it that second that story and 

449.75 453.92 B: if you're lucky they will still remember by the time you are done with the phone conversations 

454.38 455.39 B: and that's my dog 

455.73 456.85 A: that's so funny 

457.16 458.03 B: he is always 

458.98 459.39 A: i had a 

459.02 460.82 B: trying to get everybody's attention 

460.94 461.50 A: yeah 

462.16 465.83 A: i had a cat like that too i was watching the professors cat and she 

466.45 468.40 A: was siamese or part siamese 

468.92 469.59 A: and so 

469.96 470.44 A: when i would 

470.55 473.32 A: start talking on the phone she would start meowing really loud 

474.65 476.57 A: and then when i got off the phone she would be really quite 

476.71 477.07 A: so 

477.42 478.87 A: they're just like that 

478.96 479.41 B: yeah 

480.71 482.81 A: oh well i had an idea 

481.72 483.93 B: now he's being crazy and did don't know why 

484.46 485.47 B: what's going on 

486.46 487.54 B: dog 

488.31 488.80 B: sit 

490.37 490.89 B: ew 

492.86 494.21 B: she's just going crazy 

495.74 497.75 A: i was just thinking that i had an idea 

498.33 498.67 A: that 

498.96 499.82 A: if um 

500.83 502.83 A: if your boyfriend maybe did something 

503.16 503.94 A: where he 

504.49 508.24 A: maybe gave some free business for the golf course in exchange for like 

508.46 510.79 A: putting up a sign or something that said 

510.16 512.34 B: yeah that would be a good in 

512.36 513.01 A: you know 

513.12 513.69 B: yeah 

513.28 519.11 A: like please let me put this sign up and i will prune your trees and then people would see who did the trees and 

520.96 521.43 B: yeah 

521.08 523.82 A: a good way to gain exposure to like certain 

523.94 524.81 A: populations 

526.06 527.38 B: yeah i think i think that would 

527.65 528.78 B: actually work but 

528.96 532.31 B: it's it's really hard they are just really closed off 

535.07 539.27 B: yeah it's i think a lot of them are hollywood people that come out here 

539.76 540.33 B: and 

540.48 543.39 B: you know they came here to be left alone 

544.00 544.71 A: gotcha 

544.42 545.98 B: and to be amongst themselves 

546.09 546.49 B: so 

547.54 547.94 B: they've just 

549.41 552.00 B: they don't want to open up to anybody else so 

554.08 555.17 B: but yeah i think 

555.30 557.41 B: getting them through the golf courses 

557.73 558.55 B: is the way to go 

559.17 559.76 A: good idea 

560.03 560.46 B: yeah 

561.33 563.58 B: but i actually have to might do it short today 

561.48 561.82 A: who 

563.84 564.84 B: for (( )) because my 

564.94 566.83 B: dog is going crazy but also 

567.16 568.95 B: because we're leaving town tonight 

568.93 569.46 A: oh 

569.64 570.52 A: how exciting 

569.82 570.33 B: i was 

570.54 572.78 B: yeah we're going to germany so 

572.87 576.26 A: i was going to ask you if you were from germany but i was like well i don't want to be 

576.39 578.68 A: i don't want to sound like ignorant if you're not and

615.47 616.59 A: thank you 

615.97 616.34 B: but 

616.77 618.51 B: unfortunately that's sort of the 

618.78 622.55 B: the first places to get cut because once the businesses don't have money that 

623.17 626.81 A: oh it's it's completely bankrupt it it closed it's doors so 

627.09 628.53 B: yeah but i mean just like

636.32 637.63 B: there doors within

640.32 643.98 B: business were in trouble and the first thing they are going to 

644.26 645.90 B: stop spending money on is 

646.35 648.43 B: graphic design work and advertisement work 

649.57 651.07 B: and of course donations but 

651.38 652.00 A: mhm

652.91 653.75 B: yeah i know that's 

654.46 655.47 B: sort of what happens 

656.22 657.57 A: well hopefully it will turn around
