51.29 61.46 A: oh um i actually went to disney world with my family this year and i guess one thing i noticed is that everything coming in to new york seems to be like more strict 

61.55 63.43 A: then going out because like 

63.73 69.27 A: we had a sewing kit with us and it had this two inch scissor and they 

69.28 69.87 B: ah 

69.51 74.96 A: we we brought it to florida with no problem but on the way coming back to new york they made us confiscated it 

75.50 76.35 B: are you serious 

76.43 77.01 A: yes 

77.86 82.60 B: i'm mean i could see them doing that i'm surprised that they caught those cause a lot of times i can see like 

83.03 85.05 B: they don't even catch stuff like that i mean i've heard of people 

85.27 86.99 B: all the time they'll have like you know 

87.18 89.63 B: nail clippers or something like that in their bag and no one 

89.80 93.79 B: i mean they don't even catch so i'm surprised that they even caught that for you guys but 

94.18 94.69 B: um 

95.25 96.66 B: i don't know that's crazy do they 

96.75 97.06 B: like 

97.82 99.81 B: they act like they were going to 

99.96 100.52 B: not 

102.24 102.77 B: um 

103.03 105.12 B: i guess what the word i'm looking for 

105.23 115.28 A: well they offered for us to like put it in like a five foot bag and just stow it in cargo but were like it's not worth it because you're probably going to lose it anyway 

109.45 109.95 B: uh huh 

111.40 111.98 B: uh huh 

115.03 115.71 B: uh huh 

115.75 116.14 A: yeah 

115.95 120.92 B: do you know what makes me nervous cause i would think that they would think that i'm starting to actually you know 

121.05 123.59 B: you know put harm onto someone else or something like that but 

124.25 125.38 B: that's cool that they let you go 

125.61 126.15 B: i don't know 

126.38 130.15 A: yeah they it wasn't much trouble but i'm not sure like 

126.41 126.67 B: that 

130.29 136.33 A: that stuff really works like if the terrorists really want to do something they'll find a way around it 

136.13 140.94 B: uh huh oh yeah definitely i mean like for example that guy with the shoe bomber whatever his name is 

141.50 143.01 B: don't know that was about a year ago but 

143.35 145.19 B: how he had the bombs in his shoes remember that 

145.20 145.67 A: right 

145.89 149.79 B: i mean that's something just totally abstract you know you just really wouldn't ever really thing about that and 

149.90 152.54 B: is that i mean they'll get around it if they do want to but 

152.68 160.72 B: i don't know i think sometime it's the security like i was saying it's just pretty useless cause you have them your bags are going through the machines but you're not 

160.84 162.89 B: really looking that close so what's the point you know what 

163.18 167.13 B: point of them doing it half the time but half the time not just going to let the stuff slide by 

167.65 168.54 A: yeah exactly 

167.86 168.32 B: you know 

169.15 169.44 A: oh 

169.22 169.54 B: so 

171.29 173.71 B: no i haven't experienced it yet but
