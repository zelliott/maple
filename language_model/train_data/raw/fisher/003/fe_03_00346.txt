134.48 136.39 B: so um so are 

135.36 144.06 A: well i'm a school teacher and every once in a while you know i think that there there might be some other kind of business that i might like to do 

137.53 138.99 B: you okay 

142.81 148.22 B: right right yeah life life outside what what um what grade do you teach

149.31 150.32 A: uh-huh 

150.52 154.52 A: middle school yeah quite challenging math 

151.22 152.91 B: oh what subject 

154.05 155.93 B: math okay 

154.68 157.50 A: yeah and there's a lot of pressure you know 

157.14 158.79 B: oh yeah 

157.97 162.52 A: ah everything that goes wrong is is the teacher's fault so 

160.67 173.78 B: of course and and do you have ah there's been a lot in the ah newspaper around here about the end of grade testing and how much pressure the teachers are feeling to you know perform for the tests 

168.55 169.67 A: oh 

170.80 171.87 A: un 

172.24 185.99 A: unbelievable we do a city test we do a state test and then we do a proficiency test for the next for the high school it's it's just the kids are tested out and by the time the second test rolls around they don't even care what they're marking 

181.44 182.38 B: (( oh )) 

185.45 198.08 B: exactly you know when when i worked at mental health i worked in the field of of testing both group testing and individual testing and i know a lot of times especially middle school kids they don't take this stuff seriously 

186.30 187.35 A: you know we 

197.42 205.77 A: no they don't they think it's all fun and games you know and rightly so because it it takes up about three weeks of their time 

198.30 199.34 B: you know 

200.03 201.09 B: sure 

205.42 206.40 B: right 

205.93 212.13 A: and it it's just really tough so every now and then i think that the catering business might be 

208.11 209.12 B: gee 

211.25 218.41 B: [laughter] just seems real low real enticing somedays huh 

212.23 214.35 A: something that would be nice 

215.42 216.46 A: yeah 

217.03 229.07 A: yeah i like the idea of it because it's not a restaurant you know where you have to wait for customers to come in where somebody books up ahead you know and and you know exactly where you stand 

223.22 224.87 B: right right 

225.69 227.02 B: oh okay 

228.28 231.83 B: yeah that that would be neat that would be neat 

230.28 240.16 A: i kind of did as a volunteer for you know quite a few years i did a fashion show it was always like for one hundred twenty five people the only thing that scares me is if i you know 

237.09 238.88 B: uh-huh 

240.17 244.37 A: you have a a problem with the food or something like that and people get sick 

243.86 246.95 B: oh gosh whoa that yeah that that would be bad 

244.68 245.68 A: yeah 

246.57 249.12 A: i hate to even think of things like that 

247.47 250.73 B: [laughter] right right yeah 

250.06 252.54 A: so i guess where i am is pretty good 

251.89 254.25 B: there you go that's right 

252.70 256.71 A: you know you get your paycheck and you have your days off and your

341.56 342.62 A: but um 

342.33 349.82 B: okay well you know they they don't say you know number of minutes or anything like that so i i guess do you suppose we could just hang up when we're done 

346.75 347.75 A: (( no )) 

349.64 350.89 A: (( i don't know i )) 

350.70 351.39 B: (( mm ))

351.87 352.73 B: (( okay )) 

353.65 360.23 A: i know one one thing about a catering business you know or any kind of business you definitely want to own your establishment 

357.50 358.26 B: uh-huh 

359.86 361.66 B: oh yes 

360.41 364.65 A: because i know i have a friend at school who opened a business in a strip mall 

364.27 365.11 B: uh-huh 

364.60 376.26 A: and um the mall came in she had a deli and right next door they were in the business a year and the the store next door was vacant and they came in and they put in another 

368.05 368.89 B: oh 

372.50 374.33 B: uh-huh 

376.43 378.21 A: eating establishment 

377.84 379.01 B: oh no 

378.43 382.61 A: and she said it it just took the top right off of her business 

381.87 384.85 B: oh sure well i wonder why they did that 

382.84 384.28 A: and she's 

384.41 390.91 A: really upset about it well she said it's the mall there's one dollar store at one end and there's another dollar store at the other end 

385.72 387.34 B: (( yeah )) 

390.29 391.08 B: oh 

390.82 400.24 A: which was you know very bad for business that is so um you know i i know you really have to ah own your business 

392.80 393.53 B: right 

394.02 395.08 B: sure 

395.51 396.56 B: (( tough )) 

399.87 400.94 B: right 

400.31 403.03 A: and sometimes that takes a little bit of money 

402.61 403.74 B: oh yeah 

403.79 411.34 A: and whether or not you're willing to do that you know i think yeah i know that you have to young blood involved too you know you have to have somebody with ideas and what not 

410.90 415.57 B: yeah that's true someone that willing to put in long hours to make it work 

411.83 412.77 A: but we 

413.92 414.83 A: right 

414.94 427.59 A: right we recently went to a wedding and a woman ah her name she goes by the name of jewel she had catered this affair and she has a you know a retinue of people working for her and oh she did a wonderful job 

420.48 421.81 B: (( mhm )) 

426.88 427.80 B: uh-huh 

427.69 432.90 A: and it just you know makes you think gee whiz maybe i could have done something like that or 

433.19 439.45 A: i guess at this at this point i don't think i would consider it but if if i had to open a business that's what i would do 

436.36 437.19 B: right 

438.91 441.89 B: that's that's what you would do oh okay 

440.33 443.55 A: yes you still haven't come up with something 

442.54 455.01 B: i see i really haven't i really haven't um you know i'm trying to think my my parents were both self employed my dad was a um you know was um was a builder 

455.06 460.91 B: and ah and my mom ran when i was very young actually ran a a restaurant 

460.66 462.25 A: how about that 

460.91 469.42 B: you know like a dairy bar type of thing you know short you know let me see i'm s- i think she was open for breakfast but you know lunch and ah 

462.75 463.67 A: uh-huh 

468.45 469.45 A: uh-huh 

469.30 483.44 B: and ah you know supper you know hamburgers and hot dogs and ice cream and and all of that so you know so both of them were were you know business owners i i grew up in that kind of environment but gosh i don't know i just never 

472.75 473.83 A: wow 

478.81 479.79 A: uh-huh 

483.30 485.26 B: never felt the ah 

485.67 490.54 B: you know the the inclination to ah you know to have my own business i remember 

490.45 502.13 B: you know my dad saying oh my gosh you know you have got to pay you know pay taxes you know paying taxes was something you did you know once a year instead of having it you know taken out of a paycheck every two weeks 

498.92 499.94 A: right 

500.01 501.30 A: right 

501.53 502.36 A: right 

502.05 506.94 B: and ah you know having to go through an accountant to do his taxes and 

506.05 507.83 A: right i remember yeah 

507.22 515.27 B: yeah you know and it it always seemed like such a hassle you know keeping up with all of that stuff and um i remember 

510.00 511.01 A: uh-huh 

512.60 513.67 A: yeah 

515.18 520.31 B: gosh i was probably about ten and he fell one time from a ladder 

520.20 533.39 B: and um oh broke several ribs and punctured a lung and you know was out of work you know for a number of weeks and i remember him just fretting about and now they they you know he did get workman's comp but you know that wasn't much 

532.89 533.91 A: right 

533.29 543.85 B: and he's oh how are we going to pay the bills how are we going to do this you know and like we were saying before you know when when you've got a ah you know a steady job that's not in the business sector 

543.41 544.25 A: right 

543.99 551.67 B: then um you know you've got your you know paid sick leave or vacation or whatever you know you're you're pretty much set 

547.51 550.71 A: that's right that's right there 

551.32 553.60 A: a lot less responsibility 

553.35 567.97 B: right exactly exactly so you know when when they said that the um you know the topic before starting the phone call i thought oh my gosh i'm at a loss that is truly not something that that i you know really have ever thought that i'd be interested in doing 

554.62 555.55 A: yeah 

567.54 568.78 A: right 

568.13 569.60 B: (( so um )) 

569.07 578.37 A: well my sister in law opened a store um years ago and she just had the idea of buying up all sorts of fan paraphernalia 

578.04 579.13 B: oh 

578.50 583.26 A: you know like for phillys and then the eagles and stuff like that and 

581.68 585.90 B: okay yeah like a sport sport store yeah 

584.43 588.45 A: like a sport store before they had those big sport stores 

588.08 589.12 B: oh right 

588.63 593.13 A: and boy she really did well a couple of years when the phillys won the pennants 

592.50 593.41 B: yeah 

593.14 601.51 A: um she would go out like immediately and get stuff she knew she had good contacts and the people just bought that like crazy 

598.14 598.95 B: (( uh-huh )) 

601.09 602.19 B: (( wow )) 

601.91 612.90 A: so she really did well but then once again the mall put her out of business because they kept raising the rent to the point where you know she just couldn't compete with these big major chains 

605.61 606.93 B: oh gosh 

607.97 609.18 B: yeah 

612.14 614.27 B: exactly yeah 

613.27 614.21 A: so 

614.35 615.70 A: she was out 

615.39 625.85 B: because those big chains can you know just just charge just the barest you know margin of profit because you know they have so much volume but you know but the little you know 

616.53 617.58 A: uh-huh 

621.04 622.24 A: right 

623.52 624.69 A: right 

625.72 638.80 B: little dealers can't do that so [laughter] and there's there's another reason i guess why why it just never appealed to me you know but but but you know but there's some people who are just wildly successful in business and make way more than you 

625.80 626.75 A: right 

631.96 633.53 A: yeah yeah 

637.72 638.89 A: i know 

638.59 640.91 B: would ever make in the public sector 

640.22 641.18 A: uh-huh 

640.96 650.63 B: so ah yeah i guess it's just a matter of you know timing and hard work and and good luck probably as much as anything yeah 

644.93 646.17 A: right 

646.71 651.12 A: and good luck yeah yeah i think so 

651.32 652.33 B: gee 

651.72 656.22 A: so well i guess if it doesn't say any time limit 

655.63 662.19 B: okay i guess that you well maybe maybe we can you know just sign off and they'll you know do 

656.93 658.65 A: you know what do you think 

662.12 672.47 B: do whatever they do yeah because this yeah this doesn't say anything about a time limit and you know uh i don't i don't guess they break into the conversation and say you can stop talking now 

663.18 664.93 A: do what they have to do 

671.99 673.35 A: i don't know 

672.90 674.81 B: yeah yeah 

673.50 676.61 A: like i said it's it's been so long since i've done that 

675.98 680.05 B: yeah yeah you don't remember from before you know how they did 

678.01 683.02 A: but you know if they don't give you a time limit they could very you could very well hang up after a minute 

682.72 692.18 B: it oh that right right yeah just you know say a few things and you know and stop so well i guess we've probably talked long enough okay 

687.04 688.01 A: yeah 

690.50 693.50 A: i think so well it was nice to talk to you 

692.78 695.75 B: very nice to talk to you too and you take care 

694.32 696.76 A: and maybe our paths will cross again 

696.42 701.30 B: maybe so and i hope you have a wonderful christmas okay thank you bye bye 

697.14 698.17 A: okay 

698.54 700.02 A: thanks you too 

700.33 701.48 A: bye bye
