2.92 7.59 B: good thanks good so perjury huh 

7.09 8.95 A: yup what do you think about it 

9.59 10.38 B: you know 

12.26 17.59 B: i suppose i i i wouldn't be all that keen on committing perjury because the penalties are pretty severe 

18.05 18.57 A: mhm 

18.77 19.55 B: um 

21.70 23.14 B: i suppose uh 

26.10 29.99 B: you know like anything and this almost depends on where you are but i 

31.79 34.55 B: i would have a h- i would have a tough time doing it 

32.03 32.47 A: yeah 

34.82 35.32 A: would you 

35.55 36.12 B: yeah 

36.78 37.41 B: how about you 

37.16 37.45 A: yeah 

38.75 41.70 A: i think it depends on the situation i mean if it's 

41.81 43.18 A: if it's like a murder 

43.33 43.77 B: mhm 

43.37 43.81 A: you know 

44.15 46.18 A: there's no way i would do that but uh 

46.55 48.97 A: if it's to get out of a speeding ticket or 

49.45 52.15 A: something like that something minor then i think i would 

52.20 53.19 B: right right 

53.31 53.69 B: right 

54.21 54.76 A: yeah 

54.81 55.79 B: yeah 

55.94 58.80 B: yeah it's funny i would almost prefer not to know 

58.58 61.02 A: yeah exactly 

60.24 67.29 B: rather than be put in that situation i mean i suppose you're right sometimes the degree of the the of the infraction is 

61.18 61.76 A: mhm 

67.46 68.16 B: is uh 

69.81 70.41 A: yeah 

70.62 71.72 B: yeah but 

72.43 76.48 B: yeah it's such a strange thing because i mean the penalties are pretty severe 

76.83 78.55 A: are they what are the penalties 

76.86 81.86 B: in terms of yeah they are yeah i mean you can be p- you can go to jail for perjury 

82.13 82.67 B: um 

82.92 83.75 A: do they 

83.92 84.33 A: you know 

84.48 87.18 A: determine like what kind of perjury like 

88.17 93.35 A: you know like if you're lying about a little thing or a big thing are there different kinds of penalties 

96.06 97.20 B: i don't know actually 

97.87 100.47 B: i don't know if they have different degrees of perjury for uh 

101.58 102.99 B: for depending i think there's just 

103.56 108.69 B: as far i understand there's just one you know if you lie it's considered perjury and that's it 

109.33 112.80 B: i don't know if they really consider the degree they probably do though 

112.93 114.91 B: they probably do consider the degree of 

114.92 116.92 A: (( )) there's so many people that do it 

115.42 116.90 B: of what the emission was 

117.43 117.81 B: right 

118.14 118.72 A: yeah 

118.96 121.46 B: and that's one of the problems i mean there are a lot of people that do it 

122.78 124.02 B: do it you know it's just a matter of 

123.39 124.51 A: oh absolutely 

124.83 126.26 B: whether or not people are going to 

127.03 130.66 B: get caught doing i mean that makes things a little tricky 

130.96 131.94 A: yeah very 

131.10 131.58 B: um 

132.34 133.44 B: because you're right it's true 

134.29 141.43 B: i mean if it was a good friend of yours and you knew that based on your testimony they would end up going to jail for 

141.89 142.24 B: you know 

142.49 142.90 B: i don't know 

143.24 145.82 B: for the rest of their life or 

143.37 143.82 A: yeah but 

145.36 150.82 A: i think it also depends on the if there's someone else involved because you know if it's just a speeding ticket 

150.98 151.39 B: mhm 

151.16 154.42 A: there's no one else that got hurt or that it's really effecting 

154.50 154.89 B: uh huh 

155.27 155.80 A: if 

156.27 160.62 A: there was something more serious where you know it has to do with another person and 

160.97 162.82 A: then then i don't think i could do it that's 

163.05 163.45 A: you know 

163.99 165.00 B: right 

164.19 166.39 A: over the limit for me 

166.50 167.31 B: right 

167.56 172.86 B: yeah and i guess sometimes it would be a little tougher for instance like ted kaczynski would you turn your brother in 

172.80 176.71 A: ye- yeah that's pretty tough 

174.39 175.19 B: yeah that's 

176.10 182.93 B: you see that's it's a tough questions perhaps you would if you thought he was going to continue and continue killing people what if he just 

183.09 185.82 B: you know just told and said yeah i've stopped 

186.07 190.04 B: and then he got caught and then they come to you and said did he confess to you 

191.47 194.12 A: yeah that's that is difficult 

193.76 195.01 B: yeah it's a tough question 

194.28 194.85 A: wow 

195.32 200.31 B: it's at tough question i mean sometimes i see people who for instance parents who turn in their kids 

196.21 196.93 A: i don't know 

201.06 201.56 A: yeah 

201.58 202.23 B: um 

202.43 205.85 B: is that an example of tough love or is it a matter of sort of 

206.25 209.32 B: neglecting their kids because one could almost make the assumption they 

209.50 212.86 B: that parents are always supposed to stand by their kids no matter what 

213.50 214.33 B: is that true 

213.70 214.21 A: oh i don't 

214.70 220.42 A: know if that's necessarily true if it's if it's murder that's you know if it was my family 

220.57 222.58 A: or someone else close to me that was murdered 

222.66 223.35 B: mhm 

223.26 226.07 A: i i would want anyone to turn the person in so 

226.23 226.88 B: right 

227.02 228.94 A: so maybe i wouldn't turn them in but if 

229.81 233.98 A: they came to me and said you know did they confess to you i would probably say yes 

234.37 234.74 B: right 

234.63 235.01 A: he did 

235.29 235.64 B: right 

235.97 236.33 B: right 

236.77 239.01 A: it's so difficult 

238.54 240.91 B: it is a really difficult question 

239.15 239.69 A: wow 

240.91 241.52 A: wow 

241.91 246.76 B: i would say to myself yeah i'm just going to try and spend time around people who aren't going to put me in that position 

246.89 249.60 B: if you're my friend don't go kill anybody okay 

249.87 252.85 B: and if you do just don't tell me about it 

254.46 255.57 A: yeah 

255.70 256.13 A: yeah 

256.51 259.32 A: definitely something better not knowing 

258.26 261.15 B: that's right i don't want to be (( )) in that position 

263.08 267.62 B: yeah yeah it's true and i suppose sometimes i mean i people are going to 

268.42 275.73 B: going to say this is for the greater good you know are you lying in some respects are you committing perjury because of some over arching 

276.48 277.23 B: belief and 

278.98 279.77 B: problem with 

280.64 282.36 B: trial or with the system or 

282.64 283.04 B: or 

282.98 283.60 A: mhm 

284.35 285.14 B: or uh 

286.23 288.49 B: you know it whether or not that will justify 

292.04 292.92 B: doing that i mean 

294.77 297.39 B: yeah yeah it's it is a difficult question 

298.09 300.14 A: yeah i 

300.39 301.41 A: i don't know i 

301.79 302.41 A: well 

302.63 306.56 B: i guess sometimes it would depend on the situation or in fact where you are 

307.17 307.83 A: how so 

308.31 308.75 B: well 

310.94 313.69 B: (( )) in some areas there's there's a perception 

316.68 317.81 B: judges might not be as 

319.59 320.07 A: mm 

321.64 322.32 B: biased 

322.90 324.13 B: that's going to influence 

323.42 323.70 A: yeah 

324.24 327.41 B: the way that they view your case or the case against another person 

328.25 328.85 A: mhm 

329.36 330.11 A: i could see that 

331.69 332.19 A: uh 

345.30 345.92 A: can you 

347.30 350.23 A: i was actually watching uh something on t._v. that 

350.59 351.47 A: this um 

351.67 358.24 A: this guy murdered a woman and he got away with it the first time in court and then they found evidence but 

358.51 365.91 A: there's a law in that state i don't remember like kentucky or louisiana that um you can't put someone on trial for the same thing twice 

365.83 368.11 B: that's correct yeah that's true 

367.69 369.31 A: so he got away with it 

370.06 372.45 B: yeah that's that's actually the same everywhere 

372.57 376.43 B: i think you can't be tried for the same crime twice 

373.49 373.82 A: is it 

377.68 378.12 A: mm 

377.69 378.79 B: in the u._s. but 

378.97 380.10 B: one of the things 

380.44 383.32 B: that people end up doing is they'll charge you for something different 

384.86 387.08 A: yeah but something you know might be like 

387.59 393.26 A: mi- more minor you know and instead of getting the death penalty he might have to stay in jail for a few months that's 

394.21 395.12 B: right 

394.99 396.04 A: not fair but 

396.44 396.85 B: right 

397.05 398.05 B: right yeah that's 

398.28 401.74 B: that's not it's not i suppose it's to prevent people from 

401.84 405.48 B: you know being tried over and over and over again by over zealous prosecutors 

403.70 404.75 A: yeah yeah 

406.06 406.51 A: mhm 

406.40 407.81 B: who want to say well you know 

408.00 409.52 B: (( the very least let's )) keep trying them 

410.01 410.44 A: mhm 

410.11 412.19 B: five or six times 

412.29 419.56 B: and you know how long it take for it to g- to go to trial which effectively means the person's going to be in jail for the next like fifteen twenty years 

412.64 413.59 A: yeah that's true 

420.79 421.17 A: mhm 

421.30 425.39 B: it does make things i mean it does make things it doesn't mean that people don't 

425.53 427.09 B: (( decide )) to prosecute they should really 

429.45 431.21 B: make sure they have a solid case 

431.44 432.39 A: oh yeah of course 

432.63 433.84 B: before you go for it 

434.15 435.44 B: i mean i guess it can be pretty 

435.69 436.36 B: pretty tough here 

437.56 438.98 B: in terms of the requirements 

439.58 440.21 B: of of 

440.32 441.18 B: proving 

442.22 444.26 B: um whether or not someone is 

444.83 445.46 B: guilty 

446.06 448.02 A: and it's especially tough when you have a uh 

448.25 455.25 A: a witness who you know lies that commits perjury because then if they're so convincing that could just win the case or 

449.99 450.94 B: oh yeah 

451.26 451.98 B: that's true 

454.72 455.54 B: that's very true 

457.20 458.18 A: i it's horrible 

458.40 459.33 B: that's very true 

459.48 460.27 B: that's very true 

460.57 463.86 B: but the downside is is that if the witness gets caught 

464.83 465.54 B: essentially 

465.69 466.81 B: forever afterwards 

466.92 469.71 B: people know you as the person who committed perjury 

470.63 471.49 A: yeah but 

472.06 474.23 A: you move you know 

473.84 474.32 B: sorry 

474.67 477.23 A: you can move and then no one will know you 

477.07 480.81 B: yeah that's true well i don't know today in today's world 

480.85 483.58 A: well it depends on how big the (( court )) 

481.91 483.14 B: but you're right 

484.07 484.85 A: yeah 

484.14 484.71 B: that's 

484.90 487.44 B: that is a good point it does depend on 

487.92 489.34 B: on how big the case was 

489.90 490.33 A: mhm 

490.15 491.42 B: (( )) 

496.13 496.69 A: mhm 

500.36 500.75 A: yeah 

505.15 506.22 A: mhm of course 

505.97 507.71 B: or at least in your opinion 

508.19 508.63 A: mhm 

508.72 509.23 B: um
