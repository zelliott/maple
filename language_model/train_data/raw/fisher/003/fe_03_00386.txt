16.91 17.85 A: okay 

19.33 32.27 A: i you know what i honestly am not a big current events fan um so i don't really follow it all that much it doesn't seem like peace will be achieved there any time soon but hopefully one day 

32.58 33.99 A: i don't know what about you 

32.60 33.83 B: certainly not 

34.45 43.18 B: um well i i should know about this i'm ah in a public policy program um but [laughter] i'm not sure i know as much as i'd like to 

38.62 39.39 A: oh

48.39 50.80 A: oh cool that's a great school 

50.57 52.41 B: yeah i'm really enjoying it

53.98 56.87 B: oh congratulations are you a linguist 

55.29 56.12 A: (( thank you )) 

56.91 62.97 A: [lipsmack] no i'm ah i was well i was an english and theater major i kind of just applied for this 'cause it looked like fun 

63.33 70.18 A: um they've called i didn't have my p._i._n. until today they've called me like a thousand times in the past month and i just 

69.27 76.13 B: yeah i had the exact same experience i was home for christmas with no pin [laughter] i've been turning off from ten to twelve [laughter] 

72.88 73.81 A: oh 

75.26 86.68 A: wasn't it obnoxious oh my god i was so angry at them yeah i just i just said to them you people don't either stop calling me or send me a p._i._n. i'm going to kill you all but i 

79.60 80.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

85.74 89.63 B: [noise] i don't know that was the funny thing 'cause i didn't validate my p._i._n. because i 

89.98 90.92 B: (( you know )) 

90.93 95.44 B: assumed that then they would not call me until i validated it but was not how it happened 

94.73 97.44 A: no no they just keep calling forever 

97.79 98.68 B: yep 

98.67 101.59 A: so peace in the middle east huh 

102.00 108.00 B: yeah i'm not really sure whether they're talking about israel in which case no i don't think that 

108.02 113.25 B: peace is possible there any time in the near future not any time in the near future 

109.72 110.59 A: ever 

111.19 111.88 A: (( no )) 

112.94 114.25 A: no i agree 

113.73 116.53 B: (( it's just not with israel's policies )) 

114.44 120.75 A: i mean israel's has too much baggage to handle through before they're ever going to be [sigh] 

121.00 131.42 A: peace as do all the other countries you know i'm not assigning any blame but they've all got a lot and they all honestly have points on their side you know jerusalem has 

132.08 143.67 A: have different claims to it and i can't really fault any one without you know from my limited knowledge i'll be the first to say i'm not excessively aware of the subject 

143.80 146.22 B: yeah i think in that case it's such as 

146.48 148.87 B: long standing historical conflict 

149.85 154.38 B: even if someone finds a political solution that won't satisfy a lot of people 

154.27 159.66 A: no i yeah i agree there has to be it has there has to be some change in the attitudes on the 

154.64 155.39 B: (( but )) 

159.74 164.89 A: citizen level before they're ever going to be able to have peace on a national level 

165.15 170.12 B: yeah but i'm not it seems like they're they almost need a change in their you know cultural psyche 

170.05 171.53 A: mhm 

171.09 174.78 B: because i i mean i know that they run a lot of programs that really try to get 

174.93 182.60 B: young children to form bonds across cultural lines to try use up some older they become the 

179.08 180.26 A: yeah well 

180.54 181.27 A: (( well )) 

182.71 185.33 B: you know the more resistant they are to that kind of 

185.87 186.88 B: relationship 

186.76 195.75 A: of course and it's a self perpetuating cycle i mean even whatever efforts they make there's still all this hatred going on that just kids pick up on 

195.89 202.09 A: and it it's just this awful cycle and then it's i don't know how they're ever going to get out of it 

196.33 197.15 B: yeah 

202.26 208.08 B: but i mean i think some of the other conflicts going on in the middle east stand a much greater chance um you know 

206.61 207.88 A: mhm 

208.39 213.70 B: this is where conflict has to do with lack of leadership and democratic opportunity i think 

213.75 217.96 B: that you know a lot can be done there in the next twenty years 

217.74 218.70 A: sure 

218.58 219.45 B: and 

219.67 222.81 B: i don't know how i feel about the u._s.'s involvement in that 

223.61 233.36 A: [noise] you know [sigh] the united states just really has a tendency to butt their nose in where it's not wanted you know and i i i don't know i [sigh] part of me just says 

229.39 230.33 B: mhm 

233.69 239.24 A: w- we really have to deal with our own problems before we can go round telling other people how to live 

239.34 240.86 A: you know until we're per- 

240.66 253.12 A: not not perfect but until we we go through a lot improvements 'cause we have some serious problems and i don't think [sigh] that we're so evolved or enlightened that we can tell other people this is the right way to live i mean [sigh] obviously we don't want some human 

252.93 266.11 A: rights violations because those are just you know abhorrent but we can't tell people yes you should vote in free elections when our own system is flawed by its very nature we can't say ours is better [noise] 

266.30 267.20 A: (( you know )) 

266.39 275.64 B: you know the the head of u._s. i._d. came to speak at duke about a month ago and someone asked him pretty much this exact same question 

272.23 273.26 A: mhm 

275.80 288.72 B: and his response was you know about what the u._s. was doing in the middle east and you know what effect ah humanitarian aid was going to have on on the peace process and he said well 

288.85 291.61 B: [lipsmack] we can't start a protestant revolution there 

291.77 294.61 B: and so we'll never be able to solve the 

294.71 297.03 B: you know conflicts over there 

296.82 297.65 A: (( mm )) 

297.83 303.00 B: so that was a pretty shocking thing to say i mean he basically blamed islam for 

300.15 300.71 A: (( [mn] )) 

303.66 305.95 B: the current conflicts 

305.70 307.22 A: (( that's hardly fair )) 

308.21 309.22 B: i agree 

308.49 311.14 A: (( but ah it's it's pretty harsh )) 

311.63 313.38 B: yeah i thought coming from a 

313.45 317.03 B: major government representative of the u._s. i was pretty shocked [laughter] 

318.67 323.55 A: yeah you would think i don't know you'd think he'd have to be a little more p._c. than that at the very least 

324.18 325.43 B: yeah but 

325.67 327.52 B: i don't know i completely agree with you 

327.72 331.39 B: um but i just think that that is a widespread sentiment that um 

331.49 334.90 B: islamic governments aren't capable of ruling peacefully 

335.31 338.18 A: you do or do not think that 

337.04 338.74 B: (( i think it's a widespread )) 

338.63 339.41 A: mhm 

338.75 341.16 B: thought i don't believe it myself but 

340.35 355.00 A: mm mm mhm well yeah because just you know we'd have there's so prejudice put in race especially after september eleventh that anyone with with that color skin it doesn't matter what their religion or nationality or anything is we just have this this idea that 

355.02 366.94 A: that person anyone from the middle east is evil [sigh] and of course that's not true any more than you know we should all be judged by anything a given american has done i don't want to be judged for what george w. bush has done you know 

357.56 358.77 B: mhm 

366.28 367.75 B: [laughter] 

367.80 368.64 B: mhm 

367.91 379.72 A: um but but that's the sentiment around here right now and understandably so i mean [noise] september eleventh was obviously an awful horrible tragedy of course it's it's not right to blame 

380.68 384.66 A: either a whole people or a whole color of people or creed 

384.76 388.18 A: for the ah actions of some individuals i'm 

387.97 389.59 B: (( no i fully agree )) 

390.66 394.27 B: what do you think about the what do you think about the u._s. sending troops over 

390.94 391.68 A: (( sorry )) 

395.31 398.30 A: i'm sorry i there's a bad connection i couldn't hear that 

397.28 398.94 B: oh i'm sorry can you hear me now 

398.77 400.06 A: yeah 

399.67 401.99 B: what do you think about the u._s. sending troops over 

401.90 403.06 A: to afghanistan 

402.17 404.12 B: to iraq no to iraq 

403.33 404.16 A: to iraq 

404.52 405.55 A: um 

405.75 413.92 A: ha it goes back into my whole like hey we really need to work on what's here first and let other let other periods 

414.75 415.97 A: um 

416.45 423.63 A: but i don't know i hate george w. bush so kind of whatever he does i'm against it just by definition [laughter] 

421.39 422.54 B: [laughter] 

423.37 425.54 B: [laughter] interesting [laughter] 

425.48 429.88 A: (( it's a severe policy to adopt you know just oh i hate it by definition )) 

430.22 432.40 A: i'm just kidding um 

431.41 432.62 B: [laughter] 

433.02 434.80 A: but yeah what about you 

435.32 437.39 A: what do you think of the troops 

437.34 439.99 B: i think it's a really tricky situation i 

440.32 442.51 B: i know there was a study that came out 

442.62 445.13 B: ah a couple of months ago that said that 

445.47 453.08 B: even if iraq had weapons of mass destruction they were unlikely to use them unless they were challenged and were losing 

451.88 452.88 A: mhm 

453.37 454.27 A: mhm 

453.72 461.08 B: and you know i find that to be pretty plausible in which case i'm seriously against us starting any kind of violent conflict [laughter] 

460.74 466.31 A: yeah it's it's i'm not really ah a hawk i'm more about let's 

465.67 466.60 B: mhm 

466.55 468.49 A: work this out peacefully 

468.68 477.17 A: really sometimes it's just not an option but i don't think we're at that point where it's not yet and i don't think we should do anything to antagonize someone to get to that point [noise] 

479.29 479.90 B: (( no )) 

480.29 481.39 B: (( i agree with you )) 

481.78 485.58 A: so how does this work do we each get ten dollars just in the mail or something now 

481.88 482.87 B: do you think 

485.79 492.13 B: i don't know whether they're going to send us a ten dollar cheque or whether they're going to wait until we finish our cycle and send us the cheque 

492.21 506.13 A: how many conversations do we have because i was looking at the website the other day when i requested my p._i._n. again and it seemed to say we only get three or four but i've been called a million times so and just not been able to speak so i'm curious as to how much money i'm going to be able to make off of this oh 

501.51 502.40 B: (( yeah i )) 

505.50 508.56 B: don't know well they said you can have up to twenty five conversations 

508.57 510.05 A: really 

509.59 510.38 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

510.55 514.26 A: two hundred and fifty dollars for sitting and talking on the phone really can't complain 

514.09 519.72 B: i think that they must get really different ah responses to some topics because 

519.75 529.56 B: you know you and i are running out of things to say about the middle east but you know if they'd have asked a pretty basic question about our family values or traditions or things like that we probably could talk for ten minutes no problem 

522.95 524.00 A: mhm 

529.22 530.30 A: i agree 

529.69 532.65 B: but there's got to be some dud topics [laughter] 

532.24 541.45 A: that's true i i've heard some of the topics you know 'cause it you know i it says what the topic is obviously before you speak and i'm like oh that sounds interesting i wish i could talk about that one 

541.25 542.17 B: yeah 

541.46 546.31 A: but ah i've been out of luck and middle east wasn't exactly my forte 

543.78 545.13 B: sometimes i'm really 

546.71 547.81 B: no it's okay 

547.67 548.74 A: (( [laughter] )) 

548.14 553.09 B: so did you become a did you become a employed ah graduate of college or 

552.94 559.76 A: yes i'm i'm actually just got a promotion today coincidentally enough i work at score educational centers i don't know if 

556.37 557.07 B: oh 

559.80 563.29 A: you have those in we have them in north carolina but it's a 

563.49 566.67 B: is that like a skills and learning center kind of thing or 

563.73 564.49 A: kind of 

565.91 572.34 A: kind of i mean in the de- in population but a very different philosophy about how we go about it 

571.80 572.68 B: mhm 

572.39 577.13 A: so so it's a fun place and i get to work with a lot of kids and kids are cool 

577.17 579.26 A: they're generally better than adults 

579.45 582.60 B: that's good do you have young kids or high high school kids or 

582.14 583.54 A: four to fourteen 

584.04 588.66 A: so we've got kids who are learning algebra and kids who are just learning the alphabet 

588.55 590.16 B: and are you doing mostly 

590.54 592.34 B: (( are you doing mostly humanity stuff )) 

592.47 593.39 A: i'm sorry 

593.21 596.08 B: is your involvement there mostly in the humanities 

595.80 599.95 A: um no it's it's just tutoring them on their basic h- basic
