271.05 276.27 B: well yeah although at least it's in teaching so it's a little easier than someone doing some kind of theoretical thing 

276.01 280.75 A: is it easy to get a job with a phd in engli- in ah e._s._o._l. [noise] [noise] 

280.05 287.29 B: actually in e._s._l. it's pretty easy to get a job the phd doesn't make much difference at all um you know i mean 

287.52 293.39 B: they're going to pay you low [laughter] to teach people english but there are lots of people who want to learn english 

292.97 299.86 A: well if it gets bad come on out here to washington d._c. 'cause we can't even go to a seven eleven and order cigarettes without having to have a map

345.82 357.73 A: well i was in i was in a news group that i do about seven news groups i spend about an hour every night and th- somebody posted this up but ah like i was started to say i think i thought it was hokey 

350.29 351.50 B: wow 

353.84 354.79 B: mhm 

357.45 360.17 B: oh yeah yeah at first i was wondering but 

359.56 366.18 A: and i was real concerned when i saw that i had to put my social security number down me neither [laughter] 

363.04 372.72 B: i didn't do it i just ah yeah i thought well now you know thirty dollars argh it's not that much and it's not worth losing my identity [laughter] 

371.85 386.15 A: well the bottom line is is that when it comes time for pay fine pay time not to mention i'm pretty sure that somebody m- didn't go to this much trouble just to be funny um i'll be glad to give it to 'em over the phone maybe but i'm not putting it out on the internet 

381.26 382.33 B: right 

385.52 391.13 B: yeah yeah i i felt ah too too strange about doing that so i didn't do it either 

390.39 392.85 A: i was really surprised they actually asked for it 

392.93 400.84 B: yeah well i was i was too but i thought well you know i didn't know anything about if you're trying to pay people maybe you need it for tax purposes or something 

399.70 404.38 A: yeah they got to write it off probably they're going to have to issue out ten ninety nine at the end of the year 

403.71 410.10 B: yeah yeah that's true well this should be a really interesting study 'cause they're going to get lots and lots of data 

409.55 410.80 A: absolutely 

410.31 414.60 B: now of course they're going to have to pay people to go through all this and transcribe it 

414.24 422.76 A: well they probably have a huge grant d- you sound like you probably know more about it than me i mean what is the actual game plan here what are they doing 

418.84 420.22 B: yeah well i you know 

422.16 437.12 B: well probably what they're doing is they're getting all this recording and then they've got you know graduate students who will listen to these hours of recording and transcribe it and it goes into a computer and then we linguists use these big computer banks full of language 

436.92 450.46 B: to do research and they could research anything i mean how many times people use the word the or ah grammer like um you know we you and i have slightly different accents when we talk so so- someone could look at pronunciation 

447.50 448.49 A: right 

449.22 451.83 A: you sound like you live right down the street to be honest 

451.23 458.61 B: [laughter] yeah actually and you don't have much of an accent either um yo- but people in washington d._c. tend to sort of speak that 

458.17 460.64 A: it's kind of a melting pot spot 

459.33 470.98 B: yeah yeah and i've travelled so many different places in the country i've sort of gained that accent free it's not really accent free but that standard accent i suppose you'd call it 

470.80 484.22 A: well i must thank you because you made real easy at first i was sitting there and they go hold while we search for another participant i'm going am i really up for this you know i get some knucklehead i'm just not in the mood right now tonight 

476.69 477.72 B: (( oh i know )) 

478.59 481.14 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

483.62 492.98 B: well and i was worried when i heard a man's voice and thought oh boy i'm going to have to talk to some guy about sports and he's probably really gung ho so i'm glad you weren't [laughter] too gung ho i would've 

484.85 486.33 A: [laughter] 

492.18 504.14 A: and then you got to sit there and pretend you're half way interested for three or four minutes no you made it real easy i think we probably shot our dime i got a t._v. dinner down in the microwave and it's starting to get cold 

493.81 494.99 B: [laughter] 

495.34 497.59 B: yeah yeah
