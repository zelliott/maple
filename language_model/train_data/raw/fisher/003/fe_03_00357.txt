110.75 111.76 B: well actually i'm 

112.18 114.51 B: have been starting my own business as well so 

114.72 116.95 B: it's not really hypothetical 

117.06 118.81 B: as far as i'm concerned 

119.36 120.98 A: uh-huh i know 

120.60 120.94 B: yeah 

121.94 122.78 A: well

127.50 128.22 A: mhm 

127.64 127.97 B: i guess 

128.80 129.48 B: whether

131.26 131.91 A: uh-huh 

132.57 134.38 A: well that's your first concern right 

134.15 134.46 B: right 

135.03 136.01 B: i guess the question is 

136.12 137.92 B: if money's not a problem 

139.43 141.04 A: mhm yeah 

142.38 145.21 A: well as i far as i am concerned i 

145.79 148.41 A: i'm l- more like to think it is a 

148.91 151.92 A: hypothetical issue in my in my life because 

152.73 153.39 A: i guess it's 

153.56 157.51 A: never will be a time for me to set up my own business that's 

157.62 158.18 A: you know 

158.39 159.73 A: totally hypothetical 

158.89 159.16 B: right 

160.25 160.69 A: you know 

161.05 161.48 A: but it 

161.29 161.54 B: yeah 

161.91 163.39 A: if i can 

164.82 166.14 A: i'm considering 

166.28 168.25 A: doing something like uh you know 

168.39 169.85 A: food business you know just 

170.31 171.30 B: like restaurants 

172.91 173.77 B: yeah that's fun 

175.03 175.46 B: yeah 

176.48 178.14 A: yeah just like you can 

178.58 180.25 A: provide people with healthy 

180.45 181.68 A: healthy food and that's 

181.93 184.23 A: kind of accomplishment right 

186.42 187.27 A: what do you think 

188.11 189.95 B: yeah 

190.97 191.65 B: yeah 

191.96 192.62 B: restaurants 

193.98 197.95 B: i think i have considered that myself too actually i like cooking myself and stuff 

199.51 199.89 B: yeah 

200.37 202.38 B: the only reason why i thought 

202.62 204.32 B: you know restaurant would be 

205.17 205.56 B: tough 

205.89 209.37 B: is that there's so many regulations here in oregon 

209.12 209.81 A: mhm 

210.18 211.29 B: like food license 

211.41 211.72 B: thing 

213.96 216.28 B: they don't really make a lot of money just because 

217.09 220.74 B: you have to have so many things to be compliant with the laws 

220.94 222.40 A: oh yeah i know 

222.13 222.53 B: yeah 

222.68 227.31 A: well you know the the actual concern is something different from your imagination 

227.87 228.31 B: yeah 

228.03 230.53 A: i mean just life is life is 

230.68 232.92 A: something different to your imagination 

231.06 231.41 B: right 

233.24 233.74 B: yeah 

236.14 236.45 A: well 

236.37 236.65 B: (( )) 

237.08 243.44 A: are you afraid of the the codes i mean the code you have to comply to if you have your own business 

244.99 247.94 A: are they something uh really frightening to you 

250.02 251.65 B: i'm not sure either 

251.71 252.30 A: uh-huh 

254.11 255.22 B: but i guess 

255.36 256.64 B: the original question is 

256.74 257.66 B: (( )) um 

258.91 259.79 B: would i be a good 

260.01 260.92 B: business owner 

261.09 262.17 B: um 

261.16 261.84 A: mhm 

263.24 264.66 B: i guess i have a lot of skill 

265.31 265.72 A: yeah 

265.89 266.58 A: i guess so 

266.21 266.52 B: but 

267.10 268.30 B: i guess running a business 

268.41 271.90 B: is totally separate issue as far as i'm concerned because 

272.47 275.46 B: there are things like marketing and there are things like 

276.15 278.34 B: getting money from the bank or 

278.43 279.22 A: mhm 

279.27 280.17 B: investors 

281.88 282.58 B: and there are things 

283.74 284.38 B: things like 

285.00 285.77 B: book keeping 

286.20 286.86 A: oh yeah 

288.05 292.18 B: those are the things that i don't really know anything about because i've never (( )) 

292.28 293.63 B: for a major (( )) 

294.02 294.67 A: oh 

294.89 295.93 B: for economic 

296.05 296.75 A: uh-huh 

297.39 299.17 B: i was a journalism major so 

299.45 301.95 B: i know a little bit about you know 

302.09 302.46 B: like 

302.66 303.52 B: just reporting 

303.83 304.72 A: yeah i know 

304.18 304.60 B: business 

304.78 305.36 B: articles 

308.09 308.74 A: wow 

308.21 309.75 B: so perhaps yeah 

310.29 315.29 B: i would definitely need somebody who knows how to run a business and make money out of it 

316.87 317.94 B: that's actually 

316.89 317.16 A: (( )) 

318.28 320.09 B: the things that uh that 

320.21 321.30 B: i have been a lot of 

322.03 323.30 B: some doubts having 

323.39 323.89 B: a lot of 

324.15 325.46 B: problems because 

325.82 326.94 B: i seem to be doing 

328.19 329.70 B: pretty much all the right things but 

329.93 332.17 B: having hard time making money 

331.92 334.21 A: yeah exactly 

333.19 333.69 B: yeah 

334.36 336.80 B: if i get tired of that then i get discouraged 

337.03 337.97 B: so easily 

338.82 340.36 A: i know i know 

339.92 341.56 B: yeah (( how to get by in )) 

340.69 342.80 A: (( )) yeah 

342.86 344.53 B: (( )) 

344.63 345.34 B: hard to get 

347.16 347.68 A: yeah 

347.24 349.58 B: maybe setting the right price i guess 

349.86 352.46 A: oh yeah (( )) 

352.90 353.19 B: it's 

353.43 354.37 B: difficult i mean 

355.30 356.90 B: i edit manuscripts for 

357.97 358.58 B: authors 

359.29 359.79 A: yeah 

360.30 361.61 B: so they're expensive 

361.74 363.91 B: but setting prices is 

364.40 365.57 B: a little bit more flexible 

365.75 366.23 B: because 

366.38 368.51 B: (( )) all about my time and skills 

368.73 369.41 A: uh-huh 

369.76 373.08 B: i don't necessarily have to pay a lot of over head 

372.81 373.54 A: uh-huh 

374.42 374.99 B: expenses 

376.31 378.60 B: i still have to pay my bills so 

378.75 382.59 A: yeah well the actual concern is just something from your real life 

379.73 379.99 B: (( )) 

384.15 384.54 B: yeah 

386.93 388.55 B: but then again i can not really s- 

388.91 390.63 B: set the price too high either 

391.61 393.69 B: and nobody's going to be able to afford it 

393.92 396.66 A: yeah you have to be down to earth about the price 

396.37 396.72 B: yeah 

397.49 397.96 B: but i just 

398.51 398.79 B: (( )) 

398.90 399.34 B: like 

399.71 403.52 B: two dollars a page and usually and author writes a book 

403.69 406.41 B: that's like three hundred pages so that would be 

406.09 407.33 A: oh yeah 

406.70 408.08 B: hundred 

409.92 411.32 A: wow 

412.41 413.47 A: oh that's quite interest- 

413.59 414.41 A: thing but um 

414.67 415.18 B: yeah 

418.91 419.92 A: wow uh 

420.60 422.83 A: so i guess you're in oregon right

429.00 429.30 B: hello 

429.96 431.77 A: oh i guess you're in oregon 

432.98 433.58 B: yeah i'm 

433.97 437.58 B: on a cell phone so it's probably that's why you're getting some noises 

439.31 439.70 B: yeah 

440.08 446.63 A: well is it is it easy to you know set up a new business in oregon i mean 

447.30 448.69 A: do you have to um 

449.59 450.00 B: yeah

454.25 455.85 A: for you i mean personal

460.68 462.10 A: oh yeah oh yeah well
