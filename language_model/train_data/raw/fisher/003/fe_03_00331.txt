516.18 516.65 B: mhm 

517.71 521.82 B: but in the here in the united states maybe (( if i ah say before the )) 

521.56 521.90 A: uh-huh 

522.51 523.44 B: the liar or the 

523.58 526.07 B: kill for example texas virginia

549.74 550.32 A: i think 

550.74 555.16 A: i think people are likely to lie if like for example if if your son 

555.40 556.85 A: is accused of murder 

557.14 560.37 A: or he is accused of a crime that if he is found guilty
