0.00 0.91 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

2.28 3.75 B: anybody there 

3.22 5.47 A: (( [noise] yeah hi i'm dechan )) 

5.16 7.14 B: hi i'm lynne [noise] 

6.67 8.04 A: (( hi ah )) 

8.13 11.42 A: so we are talking about computers in education 

9.98 12.99 B: apparently computers in education yeah 

12.08 15.18 A: yeah so what do you think about it 

14.55 16.32 B: you don't know anything about it 

16.01 21.22 A: ah computers are today a part of life they can't [noise] be separated 

20.64 24.15 B: yeah i agree i think they're gonna they're gonna be everywhere 

21.32 22.78 A: (( and ah )) 

24.17 29.14 A: yeah and education is obviously a area where computer has to be first 

29.72 31.19 A: (( and ah )) 

31.56 38.41 A: students ah they are the first p- people to learn them because the future is going to be computers [noise] 

39.34 43.10 A: more and more of computers everything so 

42.98 53.06 B: well that and i think they're a good learning tool i think a lot of kids respond well to it they they see them as a toy and they they're gonna learn despite themselves because they 

53.05 59.70 B: um they're getting to play you know and every kid learns differently not everybody responds to the same 

53.99 55.08 A: yeah 

55.26 56.62 A: right 

59.62 61.41 A: right that's true 

59.77 61.31 B: [noise] learning tools 

62.24 64.86 B: yeah did you have computers 

63.48 68.66 A: and the computer nowadays they are designed to be [noise] in such a way that ah 

68.67 71.01 A: kids are attracted to them 

70.71 81.61 B: oh yeah well they make noise they're colorful they you know they even the little kids have got the soft pads the um the soft key- you know keypads 

71.70 72.71 A: yeah 

77.87 78.97 A: right 

81.51 82.46 A: right 

81.53 88.18 B: where they can start learning off really early so yeah i'm i [mn] i don't think you can separate the two anymore 

84.48 85.80 A: yeah 

87.86 90.03 A: [noise] yeah that's right 

89.38 91.84 B: did you have computers when you were in school 

91.96 94.22 A: yeah i did ah 

92.98 94.85 B: yeah how how old are you 

95.28 97.11 A: i am thirty four right now 

96.32 106.89 B: yeah see you're young [laughter] yeah see i didn't i mean i was um i was um out in the work field years and years and years before computers were introduced 

97.93 99.22 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

106.26 107.70 A: (( oh okay [laughter] )) 

107.45 113.51 B: and so it yeah i think it's a they're a major influence i think everybody needs to know as much as they can about it 

112.90 122.07 A: yeah and definitely when i was in my school i was in about sixth grade and i was very very very excited to see a computer 

118.28 119.46 B: uh-huh [noise] 

121.85 123.87 B: oh i bet yeah 

122.84 127.38 A: (( yeah and and that was the first time i saw the computer in front of me )) 

127.34 130.23 B: [noise] oh i was well i was probably forty 

128.11 128.94 A: (( mm )) 

130.47 143.73 B: and i was excited you know [sigh] i was just tickled to death because you know and um now i see a lot of my friends my age and a little older retiring because they're too afraid of the computer 

130.66 131.70 A: (( [laughter] )) 

132.44 133.65 A: oh yeah 

142.04 143.06 A: yeah 

143.65 145.19 A: yeah 

144.55 150.27 B: so [mn] the the next generation of kids won't be doing that because they won't be afraid 

149.67 152.85 A: [mn] yeah they will be very much fear- fearing for the computer 

152.66 165.37 B: yeah yeah and they they they know so much more about it and if you start too late then people are fearful they sit they sit there waiting not to push a button because they're afraid they're gonna do something wrong 

153.79 154.80 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

157.02 158.01 A: right 

164.93 166.94 A: yeah right 

166.33 176.20 B: yeah so no i think i think they're the more they use them the better they are plus you you get graphics and stuff i mean they've got the discovery stuff that they see on their computers where 

174.85 176.92 A: [noise] yeah everything [noise] 

176.52 178.57 B: yeah it's entertaining 

177.55 184.34 A: everything yeah and the whole you can see the whole encyclopedia on a small disc right 

178.72 179.79 B: yeah 

183.68 185.36 B: isn't that amazing 

184.39 191.86 A: yeah it it used to be a big ah thick book ah which you know kids couldn't handle ah those things 

191.57 192.80 B: yeah 

192.17 195.39 A: and this is now just a click of a button 

195.56 197.77 B: [noise] yeah see i love that stuff [noise] 

197.14 208.41 A: yeah and the things are kind of they can watch videos they can watch multi media sound they can learn faster in fact with a computer rather than a book 

208.66 218.27 B: oh yeah i think you're right and you know i hadn't even thought of the computer stuff that apparently is just gone exponential of what they can do on the computer with music 

214.97 216.01 A: yeah 

218.10 219.45 A: right 

218.84 223.28 B: i mean i think that's fabulous and i hadn't even considered that 

221.04 222.50 A: yeah that's right 

223.31 230.88 B: you know so yeah i mean i just i i don't think they can get away i think the downside is so minimal compared to the upside 

223.72 224.72 A: mhm 

230.56 235.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah there is downside but ah the other )) 

235.37 237.05 A: (( side of things so )) 

237.79 245.43 A: you have to accept them [noise] yeah but one thing is for sure that computers are a part of education now 

237.92 238.78 B: yeah 

240.95 241.86 B: yeah 

245.64 255.57 B: oh yeah and bu- and really the downside is just that the kids can get into sites where maybe they don't need to be if they're not age appropriate and 

252.14 253.12 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

253.97 259.96 A: yeah but right now we get softwares ah they can use setting controls anyway 

259.51 261.06 B: mhm yeah 

260.24 264.06 A: so we can control that to to some extent 

262.29 263.10 B: and i 

263.48 268.63 B: i would assume that the all the school systems have those controls 

267.99 270.52 A: yeah right they do 

269.11 276.22 B: yeah i mean i don't i don't know that but i would assume that that would have to be a norm where they they screen them out 

275.70 277.01 A: right 

276.20 285.00 B: if you seen that com that commercial with the m._s._n. where the butterfly keeps moving in front of the the billboard and all the things she doesn't want the kids to see 

282.50 283.56 A: right 

285.25 286.98 B: i think that's pretty cute 

286.79 288.01 A: right 

287.87 293.87 B: yeah well i'm all for it i think that the more we can offer kids [noise] the younger we can offer it the better they'll do 

293.70 295.87 A: exactly yeah 

296.11 299.24 B: [noise] 'cause otherwise they learn to be old too fast 

298.91 301.60 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

301.02 304.14 B: and that's gonna happen fast enough i'll tell ya [cough] 

304.43 305.39 A: (( [laughter] )) 

306.17 308.24 B: have you done this survey before 

306.51 307.64 A: [noise] 

308.31 312.19 A: [mn] ah no i have not done this survey this is the first time 

311.62 315.01 B: oh me too so they'll see we're both novices 

314.39 315.35 A: (( [laughter] )) 

315.02 316.06 B: yeah 

316.24 319.48 B: ah i'm not sure how in depth they expect us to go i mean i 

316.29 317.50 A: (( ah okay )) 

318.97 320.77 A: even i don't know [noise] 

320.12 326.60 B: yeah 'cause um my field is nursing so i don't know a whole lot about education 

323.77 324.97 A: (( oh okay )) 

325.95 329.64 A: in fact i am a engineering major so [laughter] 

328.95 330.58 B: if you're what major 

330.22 333.43 A: engineering electrical engineering 

331.05 332.48 B: oh yeah 

333.03 334.49 B: very good 

333.81 335.41 A: yeah 

334.88 339.40 B: so you're going to know a lot about it by the time you're done are you through school 

337.64 338.98 A: hm yeah 

339.54 342.20 A: yeah i am a grad student right now 

341.97 343.43 B: very good 

343.34 347.66 A: yeah that is i guess that must be it 

344.80 345.81 B: and so what 

347.68 356.68 B: now did you use a lot of it when you know you said you got you got it in elementary school but did you use a lot of computers like for your engineering degree 

356.33 360.61 A: yeah [noise] once i got into this engineering stream 

360.12 361.42 B: yeah 

360.72 365.87 A: i started using computers a lot in fact ah daily you can say 

365.81 371.04 B: now do do you like sketch out um i mean what what kind of engineer are you 

370.72 378.38 A: (( every ah plan of i do programming i do ah circuit designing )) 

374.21 375.16 B: yeah 

377.32 381.65 B: yeah that's what i was thinking was circuits so do you do that kind of thing on a computer 

381.91 383.13 A: yeah 

382.56 384.22 B: oh yeah but that's gotta 

383.23 391.15 A: then the simulation of different things there are a whole lot of things you can do and since the computers are so powerful today 

390.95 392.47 B: oh that is fabulous 

391.49 394.06 A: you can just imagine what they could do 

393.78 396.47 B: yeah oh that would just be fabulous 

395.87 397.41 A: yeah 

397.07 398.49 B: great 

398.55 405.77 B: yeah 'cause i mean most of the stuff that i use for computers is um word processing or um 

405.78 415.21 B: oh you know when i was working i um could design forms that were specific to my work area you know that type of thing 

410.47 411.53 A: right 

412.94 414.05 A: right 

414.98 416.84 A: mhm 

415.10 422.61 B: um but yeah to get to be able to use whole packages and to design packages like you do i mean that's fabulous 

421.98 424.74 A: mhm yeah 

422.95 424.91 B: yeah way to go 

424.86 426.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

427.64 430.20 A: ah i can't think of anything else right now 

429.53 436.27 B: no i think i've [mn] i mean unless they expect us to be smarter than this i think i've about exhausted what i think about it 

436.85 437.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

437.24 439.30 B: but i appreciate talking to ya 

439.04 440.80 A: sure i do too 

440.17 444.21 B: oh okay may talk to you again who knows okay 

442.50 443.59 A: (( sure )) 

443.71 445.22 A: okay bye bye 

444.22 445.56 B: bye bye now
