121.05 122.21 B: (( [mn] okay )) 

123.75 125.98 B: rescued our dog from the street 

125.87 128.05 A: oh really well that's nice

131.20 132.77 A: lucky oh 

132.59 136.29 B: because if he'd been out there any longer he probably would've died which is 

133.01 133.78 A: (( [laughter] )) 

135.54 136.52 A: uh-huh 

136.75 139.85 B: which is kind of good news for him i guess 

139.56 141.73 A: yeah yeah definitely [noise] 

141.44 149.12 B: but ah there you go so so wh- what do you enjoy most about the pet about this is a dog or a cat 

148.61 149.82 A: it's a dog 

149.59 151.26 B: it's a dog okay i'm s- 

151.54 154.39 A: ah well i think i mean living in 

154.24 158.39 A: new york city the security is nice um because you know the dog 

158.20 170.61 A: when i come in is always you know right at the door and of course she recognizes me so you know i get let in but i imagine if ah i was not someone that she recognized [noise] then she would not let me in [laughter] so um 

170.51 183.41 A: so it's nice to have kind of like a big dog with a you know and she's of course totally sweet and would never um hurt me or her owner but she can bark when when called upon to do so and so she's probably a nice um 

183.47 185.85 A: deterrent to criminals um 

185.90 190.20 A: so that's a nice practical thing about the dog but ah she's also really cute 

188.70 195.59 B: oh very good yeah [sigh] so living in the city i guess you don't really have much space to exercise her or 

196.50 199.06 B: or or are you close to one of the parks [mn] 

198.64 209.49 A: ah yeah there's a dog run we're in um we're i don't know if you know new york city geography at all but we're year near um union square where there's a dog run in a park so 

208.45 211.27 B: oh okay so that's really good yeah 

209.81 213.74 A: so there are places yeah where they can go socialize and run around 

213.48 220.23 B: yeah th- that's cool yeah i know i know the city quite well although i'm not sure that ah i'd like to live there i don't think 

217.23 218.30 A: mhm 

220.39 221.47 A: yeah 

221.16 225.42 B: but um i've gotten too used to the ah too used to the sunshine 

225.43 226.71 A: yeah [laughter] 

226.55 229.92 B: [laughter] oh very good yeah we have um 

230.33 241.25 B: we have ah down here we actually live out in the country so we're we're out out in the west almost out in the everglades so we've got plenty of room and he gets to go out and run quite a lot 

234.01 234.94 A: uh-huh 

237.45 238.43 A: mhm 

241.08 242.14 A: oh great 

241.28 248.05 B: although he just although he doesn't run very far which is a which is a good thing [noise] for us at least anyway 

243.79 245.21 A: (( mhm )) 

248.00 248.97 A: mhm 

248.17 251.08 B: but um [lipsmack] oh very good 

251.02 251.93 A: yeah 

251.11 251.89 B: okay 

252.00 258.93 B: so yo- um do [mn] i guess that in being a big dog does that kind of give a problem in the apartments or [noise] 

258.80 269.18 A: um not really ah i mean it's a small apartment of course but um but the dog pretty much stays in my roommate's side of the apartment um 

269.50 276.58 A: and the i don't know maybe she finds it crowding but but the humans [laughter] in the apartment are okay with it 

276.11 278.46 B: [noise] oh okay well that's good 

278.22 279.28 A: yeah 

278.98 281.31 B: that's good 'cause we kind of 

280.29 281.28 A: but h- 

281.80 288.80 A: oh i'm sorry [laughter] i was going to say your dog is ah i know y- poodle you mentioned was one of the mix is it a small dog 

281.80 282.54 B: sorry 

282.93 283.86 B: (( go ahead )) 

287.47 288.75 B: (( yeah well it )) 

288.99 290.73 B: ah i'm sorry 

290.53 293.32 A: is it a very small dog or a medium sized 

292.13 294.79 B: oh yeah he's about thirty five pounds 

294.39 295.44 A: (( oh okay )) 

295.58 301.02 B: so kind of runs everywhere and gets on very well with the with the baby and everything else so 

300.36 301.69 A: uh-huh great 

301.34 312.96 B: which is really good you know that was probably the probably my worst fear actually because we've had him a long time and then when when the baby came along he's now two of course so not such a baby any more but um 

302.74 303.51 A: uh-huh 

309.79 311.57 A: (( oh right right )) 

312.97 317.23 B: [noise] it uh they now get on very well which is good 

316.52 318.02 A: great great [noise] 

318.07 327.12 B: so that works out very well but um yeah it was kind [noise] of interesting yeah him him not being large is is a good thing 

326.91 327.93 A: mhm 

327.49 328.92 B: in that respect 

329.11 330.38 A: great 

329.76 334.24 B: i can imagine he would just run over a small child if he were any you know much bigger 

334.41 335.97 A: (( oh yeah [sigh] )) 

335.39 348.62 B: being friendly i'm not sure [mn] not quite sure i used to have boxers ah which are a a big dog a long time ago when i was back in ah back in the u._k. but um so that was kind of entertaining 

339.01 340.36 A: oh yeah okay 

348.76 350.30 B: ah but they're a se- 

350.39 358.31 B: you know they make very ah they're a likeable dog too so they enjoy socializing with ah people and other animals 

358.28 362.02 A: oh great so yeah ah i had um 

359.37 360.27 B: yeah 

361.98 376.83 A: growing up ah i mean it wasn't too long ago i'm only twenty three so [laughter] it's not like years and years ago but ah but growing up in new jersey we had a beagle and the beagle had puppies so there were many beagles at one point and um they were fun they were always very sweet to 

376.81 386.82 A: me and my brother but um they would kind of like [sigh] chew on things every so often i think i lost a few dolls to [laughter] to the beagles but um but they were quite nice 

384.80 385.52 B: (( [laughter] )) 

387.09 400.10 B: yeah the the boxers didn't necessarily chew although they dribbled on everything which was but yeah you know that was i guess that's just a a thing with the breed i you you either live with it or you don't 

392.98 394.49 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

399.80 400.85 A: (( right right )) 

400.18 406.72 B: but um you know it worked out very well m- he was a great dog and then ah the follower was also a great dog 

406.68 408.28 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

406.94 409.55 B: so they did very well but um 

409.58 415.96 B: no so it i can imagine that um beagles my wife's parents had a beagle 

415.79 416.69 A: mhm 

416.47 418.22 B: for a while and he 

418.26 420.65 B: was supposedly a bit of a psycho [laughter] 

420.99 421.76 A: oh 

421.79 423.22 B: (( in terms of )) 

423.23 424.77 B: attitude a very 

425.07 427.43 B: um highly strung apparent- 

426.75 427.96 A: oh really 

427.66 432.07 B: yeah which i don't know if that's in the br- or not 

431.88 437.13 A: hm well i think they have to i think beagles because they're hounds they have to sort of like 

437.35 442.75 A: stay and just like they have to have tasks or something i maybe this is just people that i know 

442.62 457.12 A: spouting off about something they don't know about but they have to um have lots of activity and th- i mean they do cabin fever quite easily so if they're kind of in a house and they don't have anything to chase or chew or think about then they'll go kind of crazy but um 

457.37 459.79 A: but i mean we never had any problems with ours 

461.73 462.60 A: hello 

471.94 472.68 A: okay
