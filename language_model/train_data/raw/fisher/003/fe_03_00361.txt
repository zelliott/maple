48.30 49.42 A: it the 

50.00 52.97 A: it's seems as though it should some sort of 

53.72 54.66 A: uh 

54.81 62.25 A: exit plan eventually i've heard some pretty strong arguments against it and it seems as though there should be it should be an interim kind of 

62.75 63.21 B: uh-huh 

63.13 64.46 A: kind of policy 

64.83 65.36 B: yeah 

65.91 66.66 A: what do you think 

69.02 70.29 B: oh 

70.49 71.39 B: so 

72.28 74.19 B: what's really affirmative action 

74.79 78.21 A: uh affirmative action that's when they uh 

78.37 79.45 A: uh hire 

80.03 86.03 A: uh individuals that have been discriminated against in the workplace one way or the other 

86.32 87.94 A: uh minorities 

88.25 92.35 A: uh female people with disabilities 

92.76 95.12 A: are given special 

95.63 96.49 A: consideration 

95.65 98.58 B: oh i i know that i know that in 

96.63 97.26 A: in hiring 

98.78 100.33 B: and that means in order to 

100.53 105.78 B: protect the right of minority females so give them 

106.02 107.66 B: uh high ratio 

108.52 114.23 B: and when you to enroll student or hire 

114.33 115.19 B: employee 

115.24 120.55 A: right give them give them uh uh a little chance that's a little bit more then 

116.03 116.74 B: that right 

121.06 122.16 A: uh then equal 

123.38 128.08 B: yeah yeah yeah i know that so i think mm 

128.55 131.88 B: there's some advantages and disadvantages 

132.80 134.94 B: and recently i read a 

132.85 133.23 A: right 

135.43 137.48 B: (( )) 

137.60 140.02 B: students in california 

140.29 146.95 B: you know in california there some affirmative actions in the enrollment of college students 

147.24 147.74 A: mhm 

148.15 151.28 B: because in california there's more latinos 

152.13 153.43 B: i'm 

153.83 154.95 B: maybe more then half 

155.28 156.67 B: in total population 

155.37 155.79 A: right 

156.97 157.37 A: right 

157.16 161.99 B: but you know (( )) but asia students got higher score 

162.17 163.41 B: then even latinos 

164.07 165.07 B: so if 

165.35 168.00 B: they enroll student according to the scores 

168.56 170.26 B: so we are more 

171.18 175.22 B: asia students would be enrolled then the latino students 

175.34 175.71 A: right 

176.11 179.79 B: so you you know 

180.08 183.33 B: i'm i'm a chinese so i really 

183.43 186.81 B: and news for chinese newspaper and uh 

187.07 190.63 B: some chinese students in california complain about that because 

191.06 192.83 B: even though they got 

192.93 195.05 B: very very higher score then 

195.47 196.39 B: then 

196.56 199.28 B: latino especially mexicans 

199.54 199.96 A: right 

200.13 202.09 B: the student are not enrolled in 

202.28 202.84 B: because 

203.06 207.16 B: affirmative action so it's another kind of 

208.03 210.77 B: (( )) i think 

210.20 211.12 A: another kind of what 

211.75 212.73 B: uh 

212.94 213.97 B: discrimination 

214.17 214.56 A: yeah 

214.29 214.73 B: you know 

214.87 216.45 B: yeah so 

215.48 217.73 A: well it you know it openly is uh 

218.39 223.90 A: uh a discrimination but it's in a discrimination that's intended to 

224.27 224.88 A: uh 

225.15 228.26 A: counter balance past discrimination and 

228.25 229.68 B: yeah yes so 

228.76 230.06 A: ultimately 

230.88 234.37 A: um to make things more equal 

235.13 240.56 A: uh but as a as a means to an end um it is a kind of discrimination 

241.18 241.75 B: yes 

241.92 246.00 B: so i think it's just (( complex )) and uh 

246.29 247.79 B: we can not subdue them 

247.98 249.84 B: affirmative action 

250.15 251.16 B: too far away 

251.88 252.54 B: otherwise 

252.64 253.20 B: it would 

253.50 254.90 B: lead to another kind of 

255.54 256.53 B: discrimination 

256.87 259.10 A: uh what do you mean by too far away 

256.94 258.07 B: compared with 

259.55 261.52 B: too far away means mm 

263.15 263.78 B: such as 

263.95 268.61 B: if the population ratio between um 

268.92 274.47 B: latinos and none latinos is one to one and the 

274.59 275.49 B: the strict 

275.79 277.34 B: i mean as universities 

277.79 282.52 B: uh to choice the a student that's strictly according to this kind of ratio 

282.94 285.92 B: despite all the the score differences 

286.32 289.75 B: so i i mean maybe it is too far away because 

286.36 286.75 A: right 

290.19 290.79 B: maybe 

291.05 297.36 B: mm other students can got much much higher score then latinos but they can not be 

297.65 300.77 B: can not enter the campus the university 

300.64 300.99 A: right 

301.29 302.65 B: i think maybe it isn't 

302.93 304.26 B: not work or 

303.20 305.26 A: well generally it's uh 

306.03 306.85 A: uh 

307.49 308.03 A: not 

308.36 309.14 A: um 

311.36 317.81 A: a strict quota that's required or a strict ratio that's required it's just generally that that um 

318.70 324.62 A: uh race can be taken into consideration in trying to rectify and 

325.19 326.72 A: um an imbalance 

327.85 331.39 A: and i mean as i was saying i think there's 

332.25 335.57 A: there's good reason for it as an interim measure 

336.24 337.44 B: yeah 

336.25 339.46 A: um this idea was first introduced um 

340.20 341.87 A: back in the sixties and we're just 

342.44 343.98 A: you know we still have it with us 

344.83 346.36 A: and i'm thinking that 

346.60 349.93 A: you know there should be some sort of time limit set 

350.39 351.27 A: instituting 

352.04 354.29 A: um such a policy 

354.95 355.50 B: mhm 

354.98 355.66 A: uh 

356.56 359.58 A: there's been a lot of um um 

360.87 362.75 A: what do i want to say um 

362.55 368.13 B: yeah i think there should be some sort of balance between affirmative action and 

368.69 371.32 B: and the normal action normal policy 

371.60 376.20 A: right in other words sooner or later we should be looking at trying to make 

376.81 379.81 A: uh opportunities equal irrelevant of 

379.99 381.13 A: considerations of 

381.89 384.95 A: uh of race or whatever other 

385.66 386.73 B: yeah yeah yeah 

385.90 386.39 A: uh 

387.12 388.49 A: reason might be involved 

389.02 389.94 B: so 

389.89 390.73 A: um 

393.05 399.06 A: and um you know so we kind of have to keep the that goal in in mind i think 

400.08 401.22 A: um 

401.56 404.11 A: i was going to say a minute ago that i've i've heard 

404.31 404.96 A: um 

406.27 409.92 A: in the news and on commentary programs a lot of 

410.63 411.26 A: um 

412.95 418.53 A: you know anger from uh the black community about the idea of affirmative action uh 

418.47 418.75 B: yeah 

418.95 422.16 A: uh (( )) end affirmative action 

422.84 423.60 A: uh 

423.78 426.53 A: and yet at the same time i look around and i see 

427.08 427.81 A: uh 

428.65 429.35 A: some 

429.59 432.97 A: um ethnic groups that are more recent immigrants 

433.67 434.14 B: mhm 

434.23 439.29 A: and that actually do well without having that kind of 

440.04 441.23 A: uh support 

441.76 442.35 B: yes 

442.21 444.38 A: and so sometimes i think that 

444.99 446.07 B: yes 

452.88 455.08 A: should be some sort of incentive set up and 

453.06 454.06 B: yeah yeah 

457.73 459.21 A: uh eventually 

459.83 461.54 A: be able to give it give it up 

463.14 463.75 B: yeah i 

464.11 470.39 B: i think because uh because affirmative action is so and the the now the majority is 

470.57 473.53 B: uh compared with minorities 

473.70 480.37 B: such like mm asia students or white students who are being more diligent then 

480.75 481.85 B: then latinos or 

482.07 483.88 B: or black students so 

484.18 485.38 B: it's kind of 

485.84 488.36 B: i think it kind of unfairness 

489.06 490.39 B: because um 

490.54 493.20 B: even you study study real hard 

493.98 498.32 B: you still can not enter the college the universities 

498.76 502.77 B: but if you you are latino or you are a black 

503.39 505.64 B: african american you can 

505.85 507.70 B: enter the universities 

507.86 508.32 A: uh-huh 

507.86 509.54 B: were you in the (( )) 

510.54 512.84 B: it doesn't make sense i think 

512.49 514.94 A: well i don't i don't think it's quite that simple
