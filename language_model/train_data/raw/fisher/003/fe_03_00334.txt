13.49 16.64 B: uh what kind of a business would we open if we were to open a business 

16.49 16.97 A: right 

16.89 20.86 B: yeah so what so what kind of business do you think you would open 

21.54 23.82 A: uh i think i'll get in to (( )) 

24.31 25.61 A: i'm uh 

25.74 27.53 A: astronomer by profession 

27.53 28.89 B: oh uh-huh 

28.24 31.51 A: i think i would like to get in to a business which involves 

31.63 32.70 A: essentially some 

33.07 35.87 A: making use of computing and high high tech resources 

36.17 36.97 B: oh cool 

37.00 37.36 A: yeah 

37.52 38.75 A: so i think i would like too 

39.60 41.12 A: to get in to something (( )) 

41.69 43.69 A: which will use a small part of (( )) 

44.04 44.85 A: uh hardware 

45.92 47.60 A: which can be a substitute for 

48.24 49.62 A: currently a large machine 

50.31 53.06 A: uh usually used for medical imaging and things like that 

54.21 56.14 B: more yeah that sounds cool 

56.28 59.49 B: i would probably do something a little less academic 

59.21 59.77 A: okay 

59.61 65.37 B: um so i really like like old films so i'd probably open like a like a used bookstore 

62.40 62.77 A: okay 

65.44 65.90 A: okay 

65.64 71.62 B: that like sold like old films and like ol- like books about film like that kind of a thing 

72.02 72.32 A: oh 

72.13 72.49 B: but 

72.60 73.45 B: you just (( )) 

73.61 75.82 B: um so yeah probably something like that 

76.48 77.38 A: yeah good 

78.42 79.12 A: i was 

79.23 80.25 A: okay actually i 

81.33 84.09 A: i never really thought of opening a business and stuff like that 

83.83 92.66 B: yeah i never really did either it seems like i wouldn't be good at it or i wouldn't i don't know it's also never been my life's dream to open a business 

84.26 84.55 A: (( what if )) 

84.67 84.94 A: yeah 

90.80 91.52 A: (( yeah )) 

92.12 94.53 A: yeah but what i think i would be better at is 

94.90 100.69 A: is developing something which would probably make a good product and then turn it over to someone to sell it 

99.98 103.82 B: oh so you would like develop it and like think about it like create it 

103.97 104.31 A: yeah 

104.39 104.96 B: right 

104.42 107.63 A: because that i think is something i'm better at than selling things 

108.13 108.42 A: so it would 

108.92 110.98 A: better to do something what you are better at rather than 

110.16 116.83 B: yeah that's definitely true i i never even like open a new business is just something that i never thought of doing at all 

116.85 117.22 A: (( )) 

117.28 128.95 B: so like the the idea of opening a bookstore is like very appealing to me and like i work at a used bookstore right now but um in in real life like in actuality that's not something that i would do 

129.36 129.85 B: um 

129.48 129.73 A: yeah 

130.02 132.05 B: just because i happen to like them you know 

132.03 133.13 A: true yeah and 

132.78 133.21 B: yeah 

133.66 136.99 A: in the past i worked for awhile with someone in trying to develop a product 

137.32 137.76 B: uh-huh 

137.62 138.25 A: and 

138.36 142.72 A: i mean i did i think two things like okay taking the feedback from the clients 

142.37 143.16 B: right 

142.89 144.10 A: improving the product just 

144.19 145.84 A: to meet the requirements and so on 

146.03 150.46 B: wait so do you make stuff for like i'm sorry did you say it was astrophysics 

150.63 151.72 A: yeah it's astrophysics 

151.61 153.14 B: so you do stuff for space 

153.52 154.32 A: uh yes 

155.16 157.37 B: oh like like for what kind of 

157.70 159.48 B: like what like what kind of thing 

159.65 160.72 A: okay what we 

161.07 164.56 A: uh typically try to do is we use telescopes on the 

164.69 165.82 A: on the ground 

165.65 166.12 B: uh-huh 

165.97 167.80 A: and point them to some object in the sky 

168.13 171.31 B: so you develop like technology for telescopes 

168.50 168.76 A: (( )) 

171.61 172.33 A: uh okay 

172.49 172.85 A: what 

174.20 179.07 A: okay what i've been developing is basically what you can do with the data you get from these telescopes 

178.91 179.92 B: oh 

179.65 180.96 A: once you have this data 

181.14 183.55 A: you acquire this data because you have a particular 

183.67 185.82 A: (( )) in mind you wanted some information about 

186.25 187.68 A: of that in which you were looking 

188.44 191.27 A: so how can you extract that information from this data 

191.66 193.36 A: and that's what i typically work on 

193.76 195.07 B: oh cool 

197.39 198.32 A: small signal which is 

198.66 200.35 A: (( )) deep in to the (( )) in the data 

200.55 201.16 B: right 

201.26 204.92 A: right and that's why it's something which can also be used for medical imaging with 

205.26 207.04 A: you are now typically looking for 

207.19 208.53 A: a very small signature 

209.04 211.96 A: in something which uh which is mainly noise but has 

212.07 212.70 A: some very 

212.83 214.99 A: tiny amount of information for which you are looking 

215.19 215.75 B: right 

216.02 216.59 A: so that's what 

216.86 218.37 A: i specialize in looking for 

218.93 220.61 A: for small things in a (( hay stack )) (( )) 

221.35 222.87 B: wow that sounds really hard 

223.17 225.64 A: why it's it's a matter of what you like to do 

225.49 228.60 B: right what did you want to do like where were you trained at where did you go to school 

228.75 229.44 A: uh 

229.54 231.21 A: okay i i come from india 

231.40 231.82 B: uh-huh 

231.86 232.59 A: i did my 

232.81 235.13 A: thesis um um a (( )) thesis there 

235.77 238.29 A: and then for the past two years i've been working uh 

238.46 239.98 A: at a research lab in france 

240.85 243.89 A: there also i was trying to develop some algorithms for looking for 

244.43 246.54 A: for a very small signal very deep inside 

247.39 248.35 B: wow 

248.54 252.35 B: wow yeah i'm still a student i'm studying music and anthropology 

250.86 251.14 A: oh 

252.25 253.51 A: oh wow okay i 

253.13 253.64 B: yeah 

253.99 256.59 A: tend to envy people who can make music yeah 

256.67 260.47 B: yeah it's really like i really like it 

257.83 258.12 A: (( i've )) 

260.65 263.90 B: and um it's a really good time and i'm learning like so much 

264.09 270.85 B: but i'm the only problem is like i'm not really a piano player and you have to learn to play piano to be a music major so that's been a struggle but um 

270.89 271.65 A: uh okay 

271.19 273.38 B: other than that it's good times 

273.32 274.74 A: yeah well what do you like to play 

274.78 278.39 B: um i'm a wind player so i play saxophone clarinet um 

277.77 281.85 A: oh wow okay yeah i like the the sound of the saxophone very much 

278.63 279.11 B: and 

279.25 279.52 B: (( )) 

281.23 285.29 B: yeah a lot of people do it's really pretty 

284.14 284.46 A: yeah 

285.76 286.47 B: yeah 

286.08 286.78 A: very nice i mean 

287.36 290.94 A: and also it's (( sort of )) joy to to be able to make music i mean 

291.06 292.65 B: yeah yeah 

293.11 295.64 A: and that's something which i which i can not (( )) 

295.75 302.01 B: yes but i can never do astrophysics so there you go it's all like even 

299.01 299.88 A: oh that's okay 

302.23 305.97 A: right i mean you can bring joy to (( )) well it's a little more difficult for me to do that 

306.10 312.30 B: yeah that's true that's true hence the different things that we would want to do with our like businesses 

307.83 308.72 A: that's a good one 

312.18 312.79 A: great 

312.64 314.53 B: perspectively if we were to have them 

314.48 314.88 A: -n yeah 

315.13 315.86 B: yeah 

316.46 317.10 A: great 

318.98 321.29 A: okay i suppose our time is not yet up 

321.46 321.74 A: (( yes )) 

321.58 323.24 B: i don't know how long are we supposed to talk for 

323.56 323.89 A: what about 

324.62 325.37 A: nine or ten minutes 

325.55 327.52 B: oh okay how long have we talked for so far 

327.55 329.56 A: i didn't look at my watch when we started 

329.29 332.20 B: i didn't either probably like five or something um 

330.97 331.29 A: yeah 

333.16 334.12 B: so 

333.63 337.39 A: okay i can tell you maybe the reason why i would like to get in to a business like this 

337.24 337.92 B: okay tell me 

337.95 338.70 A: yeah so 

339.15 339.53 A: i think 

340.28 342.58 A: the main reason for me is that 

342.76 348.58 A: a lot of medical equipment which is being used at the moment is really very specific to a particular task 

348.91 349.41 B: uh-huh 

349.44 352.55 A: but it is possible to have more general (( purpose )) equipment 

353.43 354.20 A: which can 

354.52 357.17 A: where the same piece of equip- equipment can do many things 

357.39 357.91 B: uh-huh 

358.18 359.14 A: so it's i mean that 

359.39 360.49 A: basically means in 

360.94 362.82 A: a smaller investment on part of the 

363.16 364.29 A: medical service provider 

364.53 365.04 B: uh-huh 

364.81 367.26 A: that using the same thing you can achieve many different things 

368.30 368.99 B: wow 

368.35 368.72 A: and 

368.92 369.64 A: and for a 

369.75 374.14 A: developing country like the one from where i come it means it it means a big thing to be 

374.24 376.06 A: to be able to have a machine which can do 

376.58 378.02 A: maybe any (( )) and 

379.52 382.66 A: and (( )) or various other kind of medical tests all in one 

382.88 383.33 B: right 

383.57 384.41 A: right so that's 

384.54 387.47 A: that was my motivation for thinking about something like this 

387.65 388.17 B: right 

388.10 393.15 A: i think it's it's pretty much possible given the technology which is around it's it's not difficult to do it anymore 

393.49 394.02 B: right 

393.93 395.64 A: only nobody seems to be interested in it 

395.78 397.74 B: right exactly like 

396.48 396.73 A: (( )) 

397.31 400.90 A: mainly if i mean i think because it means less profit for the big companies 

400.85 401.41 B: yeah 

414.26 416.27 B: and um or like it's in 

416.74 426.39 B: like a lot of organizations are trying to um like restore it and -cause it's like disappearing and like the film is like degrading and like rapidly decaying so um 

423.93 424.22 A: yeah 

426.60 427.79 B: like it would be cool to 

428.43 429.80 B: i mean be a part of that an- 

430.05 436.03 B: help to get people interested in it -cause it's so good and just most people are like totally don't know anything about it 

436.85 438.45 A: right maybe you would also like to make 

438.63 441.17 A: video copies of old old movies or that 

441.71 444.28 A: they can be preserved for future and more people can access it 

443.78 447.39 B: right and more people have access to them right exactly yeah yeah 

445.57 445.82 A: yeah 

447.50 448.31 A: it would be a neat thing to do 

449.37 450.34 B: so 

451.37 454.99 B: but i honestly don't think that i'm going to end up doing that so 

455.55 460.76 A: well same here i mean i think i'll i'll probably stick to some lab other than to some business 

460.74 461.09 B: right 

461.85 463.64 B: right well you can truly like that so 

464.64 465.40 B: that will 

465.98 467.72 A: sorry i i didn't get what you said last 

467.87 471.22 B: oh i did said you seem to really like it so that won't be a big loss 

471.26 471.74 A: yeah yeah 

471.75 472.36 B: that 

471.88 472.14 A: right 

472.24 474.43 A: yeah i'm certainly enjoying what i'm doing and i 

474.09 474.60 B: yeah 

474.92 476.40 A: instead to keep it that way yeah 

477.88 478.52 A: um good 

478.63 479.36 B: that's good 

479.42 479.71 A: yeah 

481.01 482.96 A: good so which part of the u._s. do you come from 

483.12 488.72 B: um well right now i'm going to school in boston so i'm living in um cambridge but i'm actually from los angeles 

489.46 490.15 B: so 

490.39 491.52 B: and you're from india 

491.53 494.22 A: i'm from india though i'm currently not so far from boston 

494.74 496.36 A: i'm at uh m._i._t. 

496.75 498.03 B: oh yeah i'm at harvard 

498.24 499.03 A: yeah oh great 

498.92 499.87 B: so i'm just down the road 

499.96 500.74 A: yeah sure 

500.36 501.58 B: yeah 

501.85 502.42 B: um 

503.06 506.04 B: what uh what was i (( gonna )) say i totally forgot um 

506.77 508.95 B: oh so wait how long did you live in europe for 

509.20 510.15 A: uh for two years 

510.09 511.43 B: do you miss living in europe 

512.06 513.04 A: uh a little bit 

513.22 513.82 B: yeah 

514.03 514.47 A: yeah
