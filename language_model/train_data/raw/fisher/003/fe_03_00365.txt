41.72 45.48 B: eh very pressing opinions about drug testing 

45.10 48.29 A: um i'm not too pressing about it i think um 

48.46 49.10 A: um 

49.59 50.25 A: uh i 

51.50 51.84 A: see 

52.34 56.95 A: i got nothing against it so i mean i'd i'd be for it i guess is what i 

54.05 55.18 B: no eh 

64.12 67.65 B: you know evidence that th- things were going on i think i would be eh 

68.28 70.01 B: probably (( )) possibly in 

70.93 71.47 B: uh 

71.83 73.31 B: disposed as well 

73.44 79.56 A: i mean i'd look at it as um something that could definitely effect job performance so if i was an employer 

80.15 81.32 A: uh i'd 

81.52 84.85 A: be interested in something like this to try to weed out 

85.03 87.78 A: uh anyone that would uh be using drugs 

89.12 89.74 A: so 

89.90 100.07 B: yeah i i would think especially in uh you know someplace where it it would endanger an well performance i mean it just is going to be a situation they're not going to be as efficient in 

89.90 90.26 A: that 

99.67 106.54 A: i mean take something like uh construction perhaps if you were you know driving around uh a bulldozer or something like that 

102.23 102.76 B: hm 

107.00 108.30 A: i mean i'd definitely want 

108.48 108.97 A: uh 

109.09 113.08 A: the driver to be at full potential and alert 

112.40 118.71 B: well here in chattanooga we have two large uh transportation companies and uh you know they 

113.25 114.14 A: something like that 

119.27 122.31 B: these big eighteen wheelers uh we have 

122.47 132.50 B: wrecks out here on the highway all the time uh and especially -ith something like that it would seem that uh random checking would be make a lot of sense 

130.52 131.03 A: mhm 

133.11 137.74 A: oh this is going to be boring if both of us totally agree on this 

136.40 140.66 B: yeah oh yeah they're (( gonna )) th- the computers yawning there probably 

140.16 145.59 A: yeah something like that i know they uh they try to keep it for the topics -cause then they'll 

145.74 154.02 A: i don't know be able to do word searching and stuff like that that's why they try to keep you on the topic but it's not really necessary they mainly just want the voices 

148.49 149.12 B: uh-huh 

154.58 155.94 B: yeah um 

160.19 160.75 A: um 

160.85 166.42 A: it wasn't a random drug testing it was a um for my for my job i had to get a drug test 

166.85 167.75 B: uh-huh 

166.88 168.88 A: um i've never been 

169.05 169.40 A: picked 

169.59 171.48 A: for a random drug test since then 

172.12 173.11 A: uh how -bout you 

178.02 180.22 B: the the physical thing eh 

180.79 183.50 B: uh urine and all that i guess uh 

182.39 182.83 A: mhm 

183.24 184.92 A: yeah i guess that's where it was kind of 

185.11 186.04 A: all all 

186.18 187.03 A: in the pre- 

187.11 187.66 B: yeah 

187.24 189.54 A: pre-stages kind of during the application 

195.73 200.23 B: thing called gas chromatography where they can check eh blood samples or 

200.72 202.34 B: urine samples eh for blood 

203.52 207.25 B: i know a lady who is a medical technologist 

204.46 206.36 A: so would they just come in and uh 

206.75 207.70 A: would they just come in and 

207.99 210.53 A: pull you out of your desk or something do you think or uh 

210.15 218.92 B: i don't know how they would do it i guess uh they would uh you know i mean eh in school sometimes they do it um 

219.13 219.73 B: uh 

219.89 223.82 B: yeah i i've read of high schools where they've had drug testing 

222.99 225.02 A: um -kay and just pull you out of the classroom and 

224.86 229.94 B: well i suppose it would be more eh like if you were (( gonna )) be involved in sports or something i mean 

225.21 226.53 A: bring you to the bathroom or 

230.22 230.75 A: uh -kay 

231.55 233.44 B: uh i (( don't know )) 

232.34 235.81 A: i think that would almost be a re- requirement for some of the sports 

235.63 241.46 B: well i know it's certainly at the more uh at the higher levels of sports uh when there you know -s all these -es 

241.94 244.71 B: strength enhancement drugs and stuff 

243.32 245.44 A: yeah oh yeah steroids and all that

259.54 262.78 A: but um i don't think that's well i know there's not steroids 

263.30 264.77 A: but it definitely is um 

265.23 269.35 A: i don't know performance enhancing to some degree it's not ah nutrition i guess just 

269.69 271.62 A: extra (( nutriment )) nutrition stuff 

272.08 276.76 B: isn't this interesting trying to converse about something that i really haven't eh
