1.50 2.79 B: hi my name's judy 

3.16 4.22 A: hi i'm (( maveem )) 

4.68 7.40 B: hi i i i didn't quite get your name can you 

7.93 8.91 B: spell that for me 

9.00 12.60 A: oh it's m. a. v. e. e. m. 

10.31 10.74 B: u-huh 

12.49 14.02 B: oh hi 

15.35 17.04 A: (( oh yeah )) so the topic is eh 

17.20 18.96 A: this air- airport security 

19.21 20.10 B: yes 

19.76 20.75 A: right 

21.33 21.78 B: well 

21.90 22.29 B: i 

22.49 25.47 B: guess my opinion off-hand is tat 

26.02 28.64 B: probably all this increased security 

29.26 32.85 B: doesn't make a whole lot of difference i'm not so sure it could have 

33.31 37.96 B: completely prevented hum all the kinds of problems that we've had but 

39.60 46.29 B: a- and it seems kind of more of an inconvenience but i haven't traveled by air for a while so 

45.88 47.73 A: eh yeah huh 

47.87 57.17 A: well yeah th- that's part partly true that there's a lot of inconvenience yeah ah ah i've traveled before and after and yes it's much more longer (( fleets )) and 

57.87 59.28 A: oh those are problems 

60.22 65.45 A: and what i've seen and what i've read in the papers is they keep turning up at huh 

66.58 67.38 A: all these 

68.12 75.27 A: s- small items which passengers carry then they're just catching all those things and but if somebody's really determined to get in 

75.38 75.99 A: with something 

76.54 77.54 A: (( take the stinking )) 

77.63 78.31 A: go through it 

79.40 91.30 B: yeah well at least i think one of the improvements perhaps is checking the checked luggage because hum if people are going to put things that have you know that can be 

95.11 99.37 B: that's potentially a a problem more so than little i think little 

106.10 108.41 B: how efficiently that's being done 

108.77 114.13 B: it hum it certainly seemed kind of inefficient and and really awfully hum 

114.67 115.52 B: random 

116.11 126.71 B: before random in the sense i guess in not many people were really being checked before but i i think that now didn't some of those new regulations just go into effect where now all checked 

116.38 116.70 A: right 

117.32 117.66 A: right 

126.92 128.75 B: baggage needs to be 

128.89 131.24 B: examined in some fashion 

131.40 136.42 B: i think that was start- it it's either started or about to start i can't remember really 

136.60 139.16 A: oh i'm not sure about that either 

142.06 146.03 A: yeah but i i and i guess that part of the thing that beats the purpose is the whole volume 

147.83 148.39 B: yes 

148.24 150.66 A: and there is no efficient way of doing it and 

151.73 152.03 A: hum 

152.51 155.62 A: not really sure whether they're (( )) they are really 

156.14 156.50 A: stopping 

157.23 159.11 A: things that need to be stopped 

158.74 159.04 B: yup 

161.32 163.06 A: i mean e- each time i go to the 

163.40 163.88 A: place i 

164.95 168.29 A: i need to spend at least f- half an hour forty five minutes to just 

168.46 168.96 B: yes 

168.55 169.10 A: get through 

169.24 170.32 A: right 

169.37 169.78 B: yeah 

181.92 191.76 B: it would seem that any smart terrorist is going to to be quite aware of the very public security measures that are done for screening passengers and simply 

191.98 194.61 B: look for a different way of eh 

195.12 199.25 B: of f- you know fulfilling their their ends like the you know all these 

210.26 217.79 B: i don't know it just seems to me the risk seems so small and one never and you know since they're good terrorists you kind of never know exactly where 

218.21 229.92 B: anything is going to happen whether (( you know )) it's going to be a plane or eh a ship in a port or or whatever hum or where in the world it hum you can't be perfectly safe 

229.88 230.35 A: right 

230.39 230.90 B: oh 

231.74 237.50 B: so i'm not sure how effective it's going to be i guess that that depends i guess i'm a little more confident now that 

237.64 247.32 B: that they've g- they've eh the federal government at least is regulating the kind of people who get hired and and so on and they say they've gotten rid of some of the 

247.45 248.16 B: the eh 

248.74 250.63 B: the sillier rules about 

251.39 254.68 B: you know what you're allowed to bring on and so on hum 

254.86 255.43 B: but 

255.89 260.61 B: like i said i haven't traveled recently have have you traveled since they've gotten the new 

261.01 261.98 B: screeners 

262.89 264.51 B: on rather than private companies 

265.41 267.24 A: traveled about a a month ago 

267.38 267.64 A: oh 

267.76 269.48 A: so when did they get this new screener 

275.69 277.52 B: hum so it's not those little 

278.00 281.59 B: companies was it argenbright or whatever it was that they had before 

281.79 282.49 B: hum 

283.17 285.88 B: but eh so it didn't seem any different to you 

287.23 289.08 B: or maybe they hadn't begun yet 

288.82 292.34 A: i thought m- m- maybe it was not because it was almost the same as 

292.52 292.93 A: before 

293.10 293.73 B: mm 

294.08 294.66 B: mm 

295.22 295.89 A: but then -n 

296.02 297.82 A: they're saying they're going to start a new rule (( where )) 

298.79 299.62 A: frequent flyers 

300.07 300.50 B: oh 

300.55 301.79 A: eh so they're going to make it 

301.93 304.63 A: much more easier for them so if you you can 

305.01 305.41 A: hum 

306.28 307.64 A: pay money and become a frequent 

307.99 309.19 A: join the club and then 

309.76 311.46 A: you will be passed through very quickly 

311.65 312.22 B: ah 

312.50 316.83 A: i i just read this eh maybe a week ago i'm not sure whether it's they 

316.99 318.71 A: that's i think it's just a proposal 

319.41 323.49 A: i'm not su- i u huh whether it's going to be enacted or not i'm not sure 

322.37 322.85 B: yeah 

331.51 338.52 B: certainly some of the terrorists are pret- can be pretty well funded so that would seem rather odd unless they're just going to prescreen 

334.01 334.68 A: exactly 

334.91 335.74 A: exactly 

338.65 342.49 B: the frequent flyers and somehow determine their integrity but 

342.98 346.56 B: i don't know that that does seem odd to have kind of a class system 

346.72 348.12 B: hum but 

355.87 361.17 B: checks i've had in in traveling at times i i happened to be flying hum 

361.40 367.12 B: out of hawaii on the day they gulf war started in nineteen ninety one and and they 

367.33 374.27 B: kind of just passed me through and i was leaving a state that had m- military bases and so on and i thought (( this seemed )) 

369.34 369.62 A: right 

374.42 380.97 B: really quite inadequate so i suppose some improvement is is good but how effective it can ultimately be 

381.60 382.43 B: i don't know 

382.75 383.95 B: i don't know 

384.37 384.97 B: (( )) 

386.49 388.07 A: well i guess eh that i- if you 

388.61 391.97 A: look at other countries that they're they're ver- much more stricter 

392.41 393.84 A: but i guess that the 

394.18 395.32 A: number of people using 

395.93 397.47 A: travel around by flight is 

397.68 398.32 A: a lot l- 

398.53 400.05 A: (( percentage )) was lot lesser 

400.79 401.33 A: so 

403.00 404.72 A: (( )) 

405.00 407.56 A: to my country india where it's much much more stricter 

407.73 408.16 B: hm 

409.02 410.12 A: so this is not 

410.33 413.35 A: that much for inconvenience for me because i go through this all the time i 

413.29 413.76 B: ah 

413.64 414.73 A: but 

415.56 417.82 A: it's just here i i think it's too many people 

418.07 420.98 A: there's just too many people traveling around and you just can't 

421.18 423.23 A: you i i most of the times 

424.35 426.27 A: and they just randomly pick a few person 

426.58 427.02 B: yeah 

426.91 427.90 A: what basis do you 

428.50 429.96 A: just pick a few people that's 

429.70 430.58 B: yes 

430.80 431.18 B: yeah 

431.41 434.22 B: an- and and you know and i have to say in 

431.46 431.74 A: right 

434.71 446.00 B: i i wonder what your opinions are on on profiling which has sort of gotten a bad name but it really kind of means making sensible choices about who appears to be 

446.25 449.80 B: a more as opposed to less likely person to be 

450.07 453.14 B: a terrorist and i mean it it seems clearly 

462.90 466.43 B: you know younger men and so on might be more likely 

466.74 469.29 B: and hum i don't know that just seemed 

470.02 479.84 B: to me maybe a a reasonable approach although more reasonable than randomly supposedly randomly picking people i don't know what do you think about that 

480.62 487.59 A: yeah that that eh that does make sense i mean you if you if there's somebody very old i- i- i've seen people who have been stopped who have been 

487.74 488.31 A: probably 

488.44 489.29 A: seventies 

489.54 490.03 B: mm 

489.81 490.92 A: and they've been asked to 

491.59 494.54 A: they were pulled aside and they were (( )) just because 

494.64 502.44 A: (( )) a metal detector gave an alarm they've been asked to remove their shoes and ah reopen their luggage i mean you wouldn't imagine he would be doing anything 

502.66 503.31 B: yes 

503.10 506.45 A: right so that yeah that to an ef- extent i guess that would help 

506.75 507.21 A: problem 

509.44 510.41 B: so has it has 

510.67 511.44 B: why was 

512.02 516.27 B: ah airport security so much stricter in india had they had 

517.09 518.55 B: pr- a lot of problems there 

519.77 520.38 A: (( )) 

520.49 521.54 A: c- couple of 

521.69 524.05 A: years ago i think we had ah a hijacking 

524.13 524.76 B: okay 

524.80 526.10 A: yeah so tha- 

526.61 526.94 A: so 

527.50 527.94 A: (( that i'm )) 

530.08 530.56 B: mm 

530.81 531.69 A: fact eh everybody 

534.17 534.80 A: (( much ra- )) 

534.92 538.42 A: it's not just you pick a few people everybody searched 

536.02 536.44 B: yes 

539.03 539.37 B: huh 

539.64 539.97 A: yeah 

540.50 540.87 A: (( )) 

541.93 544.47 B: and di- and what did that create a lot of 

544.60 548.34 B: concern i mean so in other words there was heightened security over the last 

548.75 550.06 A: yeah last few years yeah 

550.12 550.55 B: huh 

559.60 562.87 B: searched and people shouldn't be examining your luggage and 

563.25 566.07 B: and so on hum people seem 

566.19 568.48 B: kind of willing to do that 

568.61 569.51 B: hum 

569.80 573.60 B: even if the the likelihood of a problem is 

573.72 575.69 B: seems to me kind of small but 

575.78 576.30 B: hum 

577.09 579.86 B: i think people were were very frightened 

580.00 581.18 B: hum 

581.38 581.92 B: hum 

583.44 587.07 A: well my (( personally )) i i don't mind if somebody's going to search me as long as 

588.44 588.93 A: ensures that 

589.06 590.07 A: something's not going to happen 

590.22 592.05 A: (( )) doing it for the safety (( i mean )) 

590.25 590.83 B: yeah 

592.27 593.31 B: mm 

592.87 594.60 A: it's a small inconveniences 

595.10 595.94 A: something that i can 

596.26 597.57 A: i'm willing to d- accept 

597.50 598.10 B: mm 

598.31 598.89 B: mhm 

599.33 601.06 A: i g- i guess that's been pretty much every 

602.38 603.41 A: that's why there's not been 

605.98 606.45 B: yeah 

607.47 611.83 B: yup yeah i'm just not sure though that eh y- you know terrorists aren't 

612.52 618.12 B: i mean aren't completely stupid and it seems to me that they can find other means of of 

618.57 621.21 B: you know wreaking havoc but hum 

621.32 621.84 B: some 

622.46 628.44 B: i'm not sure this is where we should go they say hum i'm i'm in tampa florida i eh where are you calling from 

628.61 629.86 A: oh i'm from los angeles 

637.11 638.17 B: coming in and out 

638.52 639.11 B: hum 

647.79 657.74 B: for example or how can you protect ports you know from aerial attacks or other kinds of things so you know both are concerned about the inadequacy of 

658.15 661.09 B: searching what's coming in versus protecting what's coming in 

661.32 664.07 B: or in addition to what's protecting what's coming in so i think they're just 

664.18 666.96 B: other means of of being 

667.35 669.44 B: terrorists hum 

668.64 668.94 A: right 

669.83 670.27 B: so 

669.86 670.16 A: (( )) 

670.41 673.41 A: so all (( )) probably they're going (( )) 

673.63 674.73 A: doing now is going 

674.86 678.73 A: eliminate copy cats and if someone tries something new 

676.49 677.00 B: mm 

678.96 682.19 A: i'm not sure that they have enough measures in place to stop it 

681.03 681.55 B: yeah 

682.50 683.78 A: like for example before that 

684.30 686.88 A: (( )) they never used to bother checking shoes 

686.72 687.32 B: right 

687.24 688.54 A: now they check everybody's shoes 

688.29 689.31 B: right right 

688.77 690.09 A: what if somebody does something else 

690.08 690.53 B: right 

691.02 691.48 B: right 

691.66 692.15 B: right 

693.23 695.30 B: what what do you think about hum 

695.65 697.14 B: having hum 

698.18 698.67 B: the 

698.85 708.54 B: pilots and so on armed we we have my husband and i have debates about that here at home and somehow the thought of people firing guns in a 

708.86 709.64 B: pressurized 

709.96 710.66 B: airplane 

710.92 718.61 B: seems a little scary to me but i'm not sure i'd arm and i'm so i'm not sure that i would arm pilots and i don't know where that stands right now
