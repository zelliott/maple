161.08 161.90 A: hm 

161.84 165.68 B: yeah some of the topics are just really hard to talk like ten minutes on [noise] 

165.53 176.80 A: [sigh] well what kind of ah like when you do exercise regularly what or when you think of fitness health and fitness what do you do or what do you like to do 

172.10 172.97 B: uh-huh 

176.44 179.18 B: um i usually run as like a warmup 

179.37 180.44 A: okay 

179.73 184.65 B: and then i stretch and then my gym that i work out we have the elliptical trainers 

184.38 185.67 A: (( oh okay )) 

185.18 188.26 B: 'cause i think those are so much fun so i do those 

187.67 189.80 A: my friend really likes those too 

188.89 195.68 B: yeah they're fu- 'cause they're like they're really low impact like 'cause they don't running hurts my knees if i do it for a long time 

195.92 202.19 B: so the elliptical trainers are low impact so it doesn't you don't really hurt it doesn't really hurt you and then i 

199.66 200.96 A: mhm 

202.50 205.62 B: ah sometimes do the bikes and then i'll go down to the weight room 

205.91 207.78 B: and use the machines all that 

207.05 209.61 A: [noise] [noise] [sigh] i hate the weights 

209.21 211.53 B: oh really i like the weights better 

209.79 213.41 A: yeah my friend who i work with she likes the weights 

212.80 214.11 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

214.09 224.32 A: for me i usually get on a treadmill put on like my headphones and put on a good rock station [laughter] and do the treadmill for about an hour 

220.92 222.28 B: yeah [laughter] 

224.18 232.29 A: and then like today's a weights day so today's a day that's easy for me to skip because um 'cause i don't like to do that part 

224.27 225.22 B: uh-huh 

229.48 230.98 B: [laughter] 

231.43 232.79 B: yeah 

232.72 241.95 A: now when i was younger i guess staying in fit staying fit was easier because like the things you did for fun like what did you do you you go dancing 

241.50 242.56 B: yeah 

241.93 250.72 A: you know so you're keeping in shape or my friends and i used to walk we weren't old enough or drive or have cars so we walked around the neighbourhood all the time 

250.41 251.62 B: yeah 

251.26 254.60 A: whereas now it's harder to you know [noise] 

253.51 266.95 B: [noise] yeah i remember that 'cause during the summer i was a lifeguard at a pool down at the jersey shore and i couldn't before i got my licence i couldn't drive so i had no one to like drive me around so and everything was so close i'd just bike everywhere 

267.32 273.15 B: and i i lost like so much weight doing that but then once i got my licence i gained it all back again 

272.35 273.95 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

273.45 275.55 B: going [laughter] and you just go out to eat 

275.81 280.11 A: well you must be in some sort of shape to be a lifeguard that's pretty cool [sigh] 

279.10 284.92 B: [noise] yeah well i mean like you don't have to be like in great shape like i know i'm like a little overweight but 

285.45 287.31 B: i'm working on that [laughter] 

287.07 296.33 A: so like where you live is it easy for you like i kind of live in a more suburban area so you pretty much have to drive to get anywhere 

288.65 289.46 B: (( uh-huh )) 

295.66 297.49 B: yeah same i live 

297.66 303.55 B: in like they call it like the hicks of new jersey like i live off in like the middle of the mountains 

300.41 302.15 A: [laughter] 

303.11 304.12 A: okay 

303.60 305.62 B: compared to the rest of new jersey 

305.23 306.24 A: okay 

306.24 309.68 B: like it's about a good five miles for me to get to school 

309.42 310.57 A: really 

309.80 311.62 B: (( in the morning yeah ))

321.50 332.98 B: um well i want to major in psychology and then go to graduate school and do forensics and then criminology and then actu- eventually i'd work for the f._b._i. if i could [sigh] 

332.24 337.95 A: [sigh] i that's so funny i just was invited to take the test for the f._b._i. training 

337.53 338.94 B: are you serious 

338.28 353.07 A: and actually it's funny that how fitness is our topic but um i was invited to take the written test um but i didn't sign up i didn't follow through because i knew i wouldn't pass the physical test 'cause you have to be have like a 

344.24 345.16 B: uh-huh 

353.20 355.60 A: you have to be basically do boot camp [sigh] 

355.22 356.29 B: really 

355.76 356.93 A: mhm 

356.57 357.74 B: oh man 

357.38 359.19 A: so i knew i couldn't 

359.61 360.72 A: it's been 

361.50 369.13 A: let's see eighty nine was when i went away to college and that's when i pretty much stopped working out regularly so i'm really out of shape [laughter] 

368.37 369.82 B: [laughter] 

369.87 372.04 B: uh is the test hard 

372.28 379.52 A: [sigh] you know i don't know but i know it's like um i know it's like going to boot camp like there's a 

374.06 375.39 B: i it 

377.82 378.82 B: right 

380.64 386.48 A: oh no [noise] i guess like the thing i can se- oh oh it's just u._p._s. they'll just leave the box um 

386.99 387.55 A: (( [mn] )) 

387.62 392.04 A: oh heck i don't know this is going to sound funny but like in the movie ssilence of the lambs 

391.54 392.55 B: mhm 

392.23 396.47 A: um she's like preparing for that at the beginning of the movie 

395.61 396.87 B: oh okay 

396.52 398.76 A: um part of it yeah 

397.46 398.10 B: (( mm )) 

399.31 400.23 B: (( oh well )) 

399.45 407.26 A: i'm pretty sure that that would keep me from doing it but see you're in a better place you're probably in better shape [laughter] 

406.39 411.54 B: [laughter] well i hope like 'cause for what i want to do like profiling 

411.09 412.24 A: mhm 

411.99 416.25 B: i don't i hopefully like they won't make you go through the boot camp 

416.60 417.53 B: (( you know )) 

417.66 418.40 A: [sigh] 

417.93 419.58 B: like just help them out 

419.52 428.76 A: i think for everything at the f._b._i. you have to go through it [noise] but i think it's just that once like if you're doing more things in the field i think you have to keep going 

420.97 422.16 B: oh everything 

428.77 430.52 A: through more things 

428.97 431.73 B: ah is it like a week or two 

431.87 446.59 A: you know i'm not sure i i just knew that there was that aspect and because like right when you apply if you go to the web site if you to the f._b._i. web site you can actually apply for the f._b._i. online which is what i did 

433.01 433.89 B: uh 

441.46 442.34 B: (( yeah mhm mm )) 

446.46 454.11 A: and um i didn't hear from them and didn't really expect to hear from them but i didn't hear from them for about six months and then 

454.00 458.00 A: eh like one we- one day i got this package in the mail 

457.89 472.22 A: and it was all taped up and it was this big fat package and it had like um it was almost like an s._a._t. or a._c._t. book in there and it said you've been invited to take this test and it's like on tuesday so it was like less than a week away [laughter] 

465.54 466.45 B: uh-huh 

471.84 473.50 B: oh my god [laughter] 

472.62 473.80 A: (( and ah )) 

474.22 486.94 A: but when you u- go through the questions online it says part of the your hiring process will be to take this phys- physical exam do you agree that you are in shape and can do this so you have to like agr- 

487.34 491.28 A: before you can finish the process [laughter] you have to say that 

489.60 492.64 B: oh my god [laughter] 

491.77 493.62 A: you could d- do it 

493.58 494.72 B: wow 

494.88 504.44 A: but see like when i was your age i went out dancing a lot or roller skating which isn't a really big thing anymore but [sigh] when i was your age that was a big thing 

502.08 502.98 B: (( yeah )) 

505.07 506.09 A: um 

507.08 510.03 A: so i was more in shape i think 

509.41 514.90 B: yeah well i think like now it's like it's even harder for kids to get in shape 'cause of like the computer 

514.95 516.16 A: yeah 

515.43 518.48 B: and like the video games 

518.18 520.55 A: are you looking at colleges 

519.89 527.17 B: yeah i sho- i got accepted to seton hall and quinnipiac which is a small school up in connecticut 

527.15 528.07 A: hm 

527.48 531.67 B: but i'm waiting to go i really want to go to fairfield up in connecticut 

531.28 532.28 A: okay 

531.91 533.35 B: or lehigh 

533.57 535.13 B: in pennsylvania 

534.86 537.35 A: oh i just had an interview with them 

536.95 538.14 B: oh really 

537.59 538.68 A: yeah 

538.49 542.17 B: [laughter] which one fairfield or lehigh 

541.16 543.65 A: no le- berkley high 

543.06 544.43 B: oh really 

544.34 545.61 A: we have valley 

545.26 546.48 B: yeah 

545.83 546.94 A: um 

546.99 557.20 A: [lipsmack] i don't really know much about the other schools but most of the schools one thing you'll find on campus is you walk around on campus and it'll be easier for you to stay in shape 

554.49 555.77 B: yeah 

556.72 558.46 B: (( oh yeah that's true [mn] )) 

558.11 568.52 A: it's also easier to eat more because people prepare your meals for you so i think more than physical fitness like it's the eating part that gets you when you go to college 

567.65 569.66 B: yeah 'cause there's so much food 

569.83 576.71 A: and like a lot of the dorms now they have like pizza hut or or ah sparrow or 

576.72 578.89 A: peppy's or and they're 

577.41 578.45 B: yeah 

579.07 581.81 A: really good but also really high fat 

581.57 584.59 B: [laughter] prob- that's why they're so good [laughter] 

584.00 596.17 A: i know 'cause people used to complain about the cafeteria food so they got all these fast food places in the dorms at a lot of the schools [noise] i me- i'm doing a graduate program right now that's why i know a lot about [laughter] 

595.47 597.15 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

596.33 597.72 A: schools 

597.45 599.89 B: oh what did you major in or what are you 

599.17 599.95 A: english
