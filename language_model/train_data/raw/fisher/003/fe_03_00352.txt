14.18 15.93 A: i don't have the kind of uh 

16.92 17.96 A: drive 

18.36 18.79 A: that 

19.57 22.98 A: you know i mean when you have a business you pretty much have to give everything 

23.11 23.51 A: to it 

23.87 24.36 B: mhm 

24.35 25.74 A: and i have a family 

25.95 26.57 A: and 

26.77 29.18 A: i want i don't want them short changed 

29.35 30.50 A: i wouldn't mind being 

31.63 32.60 A: a partner 

33.00 33.53 A: you know 

34.26 39.57 A: one of the people that does more of the actual work instead of the administrative and financial aspect of it 

40.09 40.54 B: mhm 

40.41 42.74 A: i'm a graphic designer so a lot of the people i know 

43.25 44.16 A: work that way 

44.71 48.36 B: uh yeah my brother is a graphic designer too that's interesting yep 

47.27 47.64 A: mhm 

48.58 49.91 B: but he works for a uh 

50.12 53.13 B: a major sports company and that kind of thing you know 

52.91 53.44 A: yeah 

53.57 59.11 B: doesn't yeah he's thought about going out and doing his own thing but uh you know he's still pretty young and and 

59.25 64.04 B: i don't think he's going to do that just yet but it wouldn't surprise me if that's down the road for him anyway 

64.09 64.59 A: mhm 

65.13 68.29 A: well that's a nice thing about graphic design it is probably about the most 

68.62 70.01 A: flexible thing you can do 

70.12 70.65 B: mhm 

70.65 72.66 A: what kind of business would you start if you could start one 

74.11 75.80 B: that's that's quite 

75.91 82.36 B: a good question i did actually consider starting one recently though you know it's i'm not sure if 

83.21 88.88 B: i c- well i mean y- you could say it was starting my own because i was looking into um it was actually one of these um 

89.44 93.64 B: multi-level marketing kind of things you know that uh 

93.80 101.93 B: seems fairly reputable as far as those things can go i guess and uh it it would have involved uh selling um 

102.14 109.19 B: like air pu- air and water purification systems for home use that kind of thing and so it was it was a product that 

104.97 105.49 A: mhm 

109.08 111.58 A: oops sorry 

109.37 110.15 B: that i thought 

111.06 112.91 B: that's alright 

112.42 113.54 A: tripped over the cat dish 

114.00 116.35 B: and that that i thought definitely had some 

116.68 119.66 B: use value and i don't know i just (( )) 

120.07 131.31 B: what kind of freaked me out about it was just the emphasis on as there are in all m._l._m.'s really about um like recruiting other people you know and and kind of 

128.94 129.41 A: mhm 

131.71 134.76 B: coaching them along as well and so 

134.27 134.84 A: yeah 

143.96 148.32 B: and i mean i thought from this you could from the retail end as well but 

149.43 152.90 B: i don't know it just i got cold feet you know 

152.08 161.24 A: well i've never run across anybody whose had a truly wonderful experience with that type of system i've got a close friend who 

161.78 164.13 A: we don't live in the same town anymore but she 

164.60 166.03 A: has gotten involved with something 

166.19 169.91 A: like that they sell uh nutritional supplements and 

169.39 170.18 B: mhm 

170.20 172.71 A: skin care thing and um 

173.23 179.47 A: i could tell she was not directly trying to ask me but trying to find out if i would be at all interested 

179.61 180.13 B: mhm 

180.07 181.55 A: even thought i think she knew 

181.99 184.22 A: i'd never go for something like that 

184.02 184.54 B: mhm 

184.98 187.86 A: and it does seem like they they kind of 

187.98 189.76 A: they try to hook people in with 

190.02 193.08 A: just oh you can just become fabulously wealthy 

193.81 195.67 A: you know in such a short time 

195.54 196.12 B: mhm 

196.00 198.58 A: work ten hours a week from your basement or whatever 

198.89 199.38 B: mhm 

199.44 201.06 A: and this is also a company that's 

201.86 206.86 A: somewhat reputable at least as far as i know but it's just not something i could do i've always wondered 

208.15 208.60 A: you know 

208.78 209.42 A: who thought of 

210.29 212.54 A: this approach and does it really work 

212.76 213.29 B: mhm 

214.24 214.68 A: i just 

215.08 218.31 A: you know i know what my (( )) work enough years 

218.90 221.08 A: to know what my strengths and weaknesses are 

221.24 221.75 B: mhm 

221.69 222.18 A: not 

223.30 225.11 A: good in terms of managerial 

226.72 227.37 A: good at managing 

230.30 230.78 B: mhm 

232.47 234.28 A: i i really can't stand 

235.08 236.16 A: the politics 

236.83 238.13 A: you know they go along with 

239.32 240.56 A: setting things up and 

241.56 242.38 A: going out and 

242.52 244.75 A: getting funding and getting clients and (( )) 

244.46 244.99 B: mhm 

245.90 249.71 A: marketing although i have had to do some of those things to and uh 

250.24 251.38 A: to a small extent 

251.50 251.95 B: mhm 

251.81 252.34 A: but i'm 

253.09 254.97 A: i just like to do what i do 

255.26 257.15 A: which is graphic design so i'm 

257.36 259.04 A: i'm at my best working for someone else 

259.36 259.83 B: mhm 

260.58 261.03 A: but it's 

260.76 265.13 B: yeah well i mean it's good to know that you know it uh keeps you form 

262.57 263.05 A: mhm 

265.89 269.03 B: chasing uh false leads and hopes 

269.81 270.36 A: yeah 

269.85 273.59 B: and it keeps you on track with something you know you can do and do well so 

273.38 274.38 A: well it's it ju- 

275.06 279.89 A: you know i think there are people who have a fundamentally different approach to what they want to do with their life you know my 

280.57 283.59 A: i love what i do and i do what i love 

283.28 283.81 B: mhm 

283.72 285.45 A: see i'm in a position where i can do that 

286.33 287.55 A: but some people are 

288.58 290.01 A: doing what they do to make money 

290.40 290.88 B: mhm 

290.87 292.85 A: you know and so they're they're in pursuit of 

293.19 294.77 A: of what it will bring them rather than 

295.21 295.81 A: doing 

296.00 296.61 A: what they do 

296.95 297.45 B: mhm 

297.36 303.00 A: my husband is a scientist and he's sort of the same way i mean he is a scientist because he loves science and he loves research 

303.07 303.68 B: mhm 

304.36 307.43 A: so we we both know we would stink as business owners 

307.38 309.40 B: right 

308.41 309.77 A: (( but uh um )) what do you do 

309.97 316.45 B: uh well actually right now i'm waiting for my wife to kind of finish her p._h._d. um and 

315.07 315.41 A: oh 

316.81 317.64 B: so 

317.78 321.66 B: i've kind of i i live in um a town where it's 

334.98 335.92 A: that's fascinating 

336.11 339.32 B: which um yeah has been real enjoyable for me and 

339.75 342.26 B: what my real love is is kind of uh 

343.21 346.10 B: learning and teaching wilderness survival skills 

346.38 346.85 A: mhm 

346.89 348.32 B: and so um 

361.06 363.95 A: i think that you would be able to find a niche for something like that 

364.50 364.87 A: (( )) 

364.53 370.22 B: but there there are a number of schools like that around the country already so it's kind of like you know 

369.08 369.42 A: hm 

370.48 379.54 B: at at present i'm still very much in the process of gaining my own education to the point where i'd be comfortable teaching a wide range of skills to people um 

378.00 378.33 A: true 

379.78 381.67 B: but yeah then of course finding 

389.53 393.13 B: and where you have you know a a bit of land that you can you know 

393.40 395.16 B: set up a few buildings on and 

395.83 396.65 B: and uh 

396.92 405.35 B: so yeah there's a there's great logistical aspect to if that uh is going to be quite the challenge if the time comes 

405.14 408.52 A: so i'm guessing you're not going to go on for a p._h._d. in history then 

408.64 414.97 B: no actually the the masters in history was more or less because when i finished my undergrad i wasn't sure 

415.14 419.50 B: really what i wanted to do and uh instead of doing 

418.76 420.46 A: when all else fails go to grad school 

420.57 431.35 B: well yeah yeah exactly which is a sha- the shame of it is you know i i've since worked over in japan teaching english and stuff like that if i would have done that right as an undergrad i would have been able to put 

428.39 428.67 A: (( never )) 

431.53 434.31 B: a good amount of money away and uh 

433.73 433.99 A: (( yeah )) 

434.86 440.62 B: and been making money instead of spending it while i was trying to sort things out you know 

439.61 442.68 A: i have a number of friends who went and did that after graduation too 

442.15 442.87 B: oh yeah 

443.04 447.47 A: so and my father is actually a retired anthropology prof so i'm very familiar with 

448.12 449.81 A: the ups and owns of going through 

450.26 451.50 A: post graduate years 

451.52 452.70 B: mhm mhm 

452.67 453.93 A: well he was retired but 

454.32 456.41 A: you know i've seen it and my husband also is 

456.55 457.88 A: (( he has )) a p._h._d. too and i've 

458.12 459.47 A: been with him through the entire 

460.35 461.06 A: process 

461.01 461.70 B: mhm 

462.43 466.48 B: it's uh yeah is a pretty turbulent road 

466.00 467.50 A: what's your wife getting her p._h._d. in 

467.35 469.42 B: in applied linguistics 

469.39 470.02 A: oh wow 

470.16 471.29 A: i know some people who are 

470.30 470.90 B: yeah 

471.80 473.33 A: a married coup- they both are 

473.53 474.07 A: linguistic 

474.23 475.30 A: p._h._d.'s now they're 

476.04 477.10 A: put over to georgia tech 

477.42 478.07 B: oh really 

478.00 479.21 A: and stanford so 

479.39 479.92 B: mhm 

480.27 480.75 A: yeah 

481.98 482.24 A: i'm 

483.07 483.83 A: he's doing 

484.25 485.32 A: more things with 

485.42 485.93 A: the 

486.73 488.68 A: (( neuro )) psychology she's doing 

488.86 490.19 A: uh things more with like 

491.80 492.33 B: oh yeah 

493.80 500.94 B: yeah my wife's emphasis is on a well her background is a teaching english as a second language and so she looks at um 

499.11 499.64 A: mhm 

502.62 507.19 B: she looks primarily at the teaching and learning of um writing 

507.50 513.02 B: and to especially the speakers of other languages and so you know 

513.33 515.21 B: she uses various uh 

515.66 522.18 B: i mean comes at it from various angles but the one that she's doing her dissertation on is uh about using ah 

522.28 525.08 B: technological media be those 

525.65 535.11 B: the web uh the internet chat rooms um whatever i mean just anything word processing even and you know does this 

528.35 528.80 A: mhm 

532.76 533.13 A: right 

535.22 547.13 B: how is this being used um because in the past people have asked the questions you know like well is this better or worse than the traditional classrooms and i mean that's a pretty useless 

548.53 554.59 B: well first of all what do you mean by the traditional classroom i mean everybody does it differently anyway you know and 

558.17 558.48 A: yeah 

562.41 564.66 B: what's there background exposure to it and 

565.02 566.74 B: and so she's really trying to 

582.25 585.16 A: well even technology is such an incredibly broad 

582.34 583.27 B: statement 

585.40 585.94 A: you know 

586.07 586.76 A: term 

586.52 587.78 B: oh yeah sure
