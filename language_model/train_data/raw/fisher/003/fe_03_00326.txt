57.50 62.47 B: when yeah but then you think about it and it's for a close family member 

62.47 64.31 A: close friend or family member 

63.99 69.17 B: and and yeah and the more i got to thinking about it the more i think that 

70.40 75.07 B: uh the more acceptable it is to me not that i'm i'm necessarily one hundred percent agreed with it but 

74.91 75.36 A: mhm 

75.65 76.24 B: um 

76.57 78.93 B: if for (( )) if it were for something very minimal 

79.50 79.94 B: then 

80.58 81.08 B: um 

81.59 85.11 B: i think i would i would be okay with it but if it were for a very heinous crime 

85.71 87.70 B: i don't think i would be okay committing perjury 

87.80 88.32 A: right 

89.45 89.85 A: i 

90.90 98.92 A: i'm just thinking that with me i i always feel like it's better to tell the truth i don't always tell the truth i'm i'm human but 

99.51 102.52 A: i wonder if i'd almost end up hurting someone more 

102.69 103.21 A: by 

103.88 108.37 A: lying and then not being credible when they somehow proved that i lied because that 

108.50 110.33 A: that would be my scar- my 

110.46 111.00 B: mhm 

110.69 113.93 A: i would really be afraid to lie in a court of law because 

115.53 116.97 A: you know what if 

117.17 118.25 A: what if you can't lie 

118.69 122.22 A: what if if you can't lie well enough and they discover you're lying 

122.52 129.35 A: and then not only is your friend or family member in trouble you know then i would be too so 

128.87 129.46 B: you know what's funny 

129.62 130.77 A: i i don't know 

129.92 130.65 B: (( )) 

131.08 132.48 B: saying that uh 

133.33 136.51 B: there's a saying that it's always the best policy to tell the truth unless 

136.88 139.90 B: of course you're an exceptionally good liar 

138.31 145.54 A: right i don't think i fall into the category of exceptionally good you know i i just 

145.76 150.82 A: i don't know i'd just really try not to testify if i had to say something bad about somebody 

150.97 151.37 A: but 

152.15 153.47 B: but you're really forced to i guess 

152.21 154.17 A: maybe like you sa- what's that 

154.42 155.53 B: you're forced to though aren't you 

156.15 160.30 A: yeah i think in some sit- in some situations you are forced too 

161.04 162.18 A: i don't know 

163.26 170.75 A: this is tough to have to talk about with somebody you don't know either um i i thin- you know i'm trying to think of somebody i really love 

167.09 167.58 B: uh-huh 

171.33 172.05 A: you know 

172.17 173.14 A: deep down 

173.38 175.08 A: i think i'd have to say 

175.92 176.58 A: i'd lie 

177.47 177.98 A: i would 

178.29 182.20 B: i think i would too i mean if it were my mother or my father or my sister 

178.30 181.59 A: if it was someone if it was someone yeah 

182.01 185.65 A: right if it's someone i really love it would be like 

187.16 189.21 A: yeah lie yeah i would 

191.66 194.27 A: i would i mean especially if i felt like 

195.13 199.85 A: whatever they did was accidental or there was some reason and they were getting 

200.20 201.70 A: potentially going to have 

202.06 205.19 A: uh a horrible punishment for something that 

206.70 213.56 A: no i wouldn't want to see them get hurt i i guess also on the other hand if it's somebody i really love but if they 

213.74 219.75 A: did like you said if it was some kind of heinous crime i mean if they did something that was really sick or twisted 

216.43 216.93 B: (( )) 

218.29 220.84 B: i think exactly for me if it were really 

221.00 223.98 B: that serious that it would get to me if i committed perjury 

224.46 229.57 A: yeah and and not only that i mean i would want them to have help obviously whatever they would be 

228.28 228.88 B: uh-huh 

229.87 232.17 A: it at a trial for 

233.41 240.72 A: you know whether it's shop lifting i don't know see tha- i guess i'm debating it in my own mind as i'm talking to you about it i've never really thought about it 

239.31 244.14 B: yeah that's actually that's a good point is because it's is something simple like shop lifting for example 

243.71 244.15 A: right 

244.75 245.32 B: i mean 

245.41 248.36 A: they still need help though but hopefully just the whole 

245.45 246.08 B: i wouldn't 

247.32 249.80 B: exactly yeah you would want them to you wouldn't want 

248.52 248.82 A: (( )) 

249.98 250.66 B: a loved one 

250.83 252.32 B: to do something like that 

251.91 252.40 A: no 

253.52 255.66 B: so in that case perjury would be bad i believe 

257.07 257.50 A: right 

257.84 261.22 A: and well and the other thing is too i mean i would hope they just 

262.52 267.07 A: the punishment might even just be going through the legal process 

267.19 275.88 A: you know even if they don't didn't end up getting a sentence just having to go through the trial and the fear of being punished or sentenced in something 

277.46 279.62 A: in a way is part of the punishment 

280.95 282.19 A: i don't know i think that if 

282.32 283.74 A: i i guess 

285.09 292.50 A: i i guess neither one of us has an absolute answer right off the top of our heads i mean and how can you because it is hypothetical 

289.93 290.67 B: mhm 

292.30 292.73 B: yeah 

292.81 294.81 A: but i mean as i keep talking about it i keep 

294.96 299.53 A: shifting what i do because i'm thinking about it from different view points 

299.67 299.98 A: but 

301.85 302.32 A: i can't 

302.45 306.01 A: i wouldn't want to think about somebody i love actually being in prison 

306.58 308.05 A: from everything i've heard about it 

309.70 314.17 A: i don't know it's like keep them out of jail 

316.00 317.02 A: i don't know 

318.09 319.59 A: well this is very strange 

320.54 323.59 A: what else can we say about this it's not a very broad topic 

323.92 325.09 B: it isn't um 

324.68 330.32 A: no i know how many minutes have we had do you know um 

327.66 329.04 B: i'm not really sure 

331.03 336.84 A: let's see i'm going to think about it i actually have children so i'm going to think about it as like them 

337.78 339.63 A: and like being a mom 

341.64 347.91 A: you know i think it really would depend on what close friend or what loved one we're talking about and what crime 

348.09 348.65 A: they 

348.99 352.97 A: possibly committed and if we knew the circumstances and 

356.01 356.68 A: i don't know 

358.57 358.87 A: like 

359.14 362.78 A: all right well this is so anonymous i can just say this (( )) actually 

362.97 363.53 A: am 

363.95 368.50 A: a victim in a case that's in court right now and 

367.86 368.30 B: mhm 

369.40 372.26 A: the thought of somebody lying for that person 

374.02 374.74 A: makes me 

375.03 375.49 A: you know 

375.61 377.20 A: well that's something i i don't 

377.35 389.24 A: let myself spend too much time thinking about it until we get closer to a point when there's a trial but you know yeah that could certainly happen somebody could get up there and make something up that makes this person seem much more credible and 

390.15 390.80 A: and uh 

392.28 398.62 A: but i guess those things happen so i mean i guess too if i if i were in a situation where i had to 

400.25 402.27 A: consider lying to somebody 

402.71 403.78 A: i would um 

406.59 413.75 A: i hope i would put myself in the place of whoever was victimized too whatever that crime happened to be 

414.43 414.89 B: mhm 

416.37 419.98 A: i think i'd be really upset if i got put in that situation 

416.53 417.20 B: i think 

420.21 422.77 A: i'm upset just thinking about it 

420.27 421.39 B: yeah i think 

423.38 424.62 B: theoretically speaking 

424.99 425.38 A: yeah 

425.13 427.61 B: and the and and this is not putting it into 

427.93 428.61 B: into use 

428.75 429.36 A: mhm 

429.27 429.84 B: i think 

430.18 432.26 B: i definitely would and most people would say 

432.36 433.53 B: you would do the right thing 

433.93 434.42 A: right 

434.82 435.72 B: and 

435.99 437.74 B: because who wouldn't want to do the right thing 

438.38 438.93 B: so 

440.06 443.45 B: i'd have to think for myself that in those cases i probably would because 

444.07 444.51 B: it's 

445.57 451.74 B: if i could use your example if i had children which i don't if i had children and i lied 

448.16 448.56 A: mmm 

448.72 449.65 A: mhm 

452.48 453.05 B: for them 

453.17 453.56 A: right 

453.29 454.59 B: i committed perjury 

454.44 454.77 A: right 

455.04 462.42 B: i would just let alone like the example i'd be set- i mean it it is the example that i'm setting i should teach them not to do that they should 

461.77 462.31 A: right 

463.57 464.10 B: they should 

464.87 470.18 B: learn to not commit whatever crime they did and they should learn that lying is not is not right and i think 

469.77 470.12 A: right 

470.58 471.92 B: from that point of view definitely 

472.58 474.10 B: i mean that's definitely my answer but 

474.74 475.79 B: i i'm sure 

476.02 478.98 B: that anyone can argue there'd be some sort of situation where 

479.74 480.58 B: most people 

480.88 481.42 B: could 

481.95 486.07 B: conceive of committing perjury i don't know but i think i think i'd definitely say 

483.59 484.00 A: right 

486.90 491.36 B: just without having to actually do it that i'd probably would not commit perjury 

491.48 491.85 B: but 

492.11 492.80 B: put in 

492.91 493.85 B: the situation 

494.26 495.15 B: things could be different 

495.77 496.19 A: right 

497.25 498.49 A: i think that's true 

500.00 505.79 A: and you know if uh i'm thinking now about being a parent cause i've tra- i've gone on to that track but 

506.03 507.00 A: you know hopefully 

507.09 507.40 A: if 

507.67 508.62 A: you've parented 

509.16 517.32 A: uh that's another whole topic but i mean if you've parented i was going to say (( )) i might as well say cause we have time if you've parented correctly 

515.44 515.81 B: sure 

517.66 520.68 A: whatever that is or taught your children 

520.88 521.57 A: um 

522.05 523.46 A: to have good morals 

524.34 528.30 A: hopefully they wouldn't be in a situation unless it was a mistake 

528.53 529.09 A: and 

530.20 531.13 A: and 

531.67 532.37 A: so i wouldn't 

532.90 540.32 A: i don't certainly plan on having to defend my children or or lie for them in court i'm knocking on wood when i say that but 

540.54 541.17 A: um 

541.51 546.37 A: like you just said i mean it wouldn't ge- be a good example for them if you lied for them in court 

547.08 547.46 A: but 

550.12 553.06 A: i i hope that i give them a good example 

553.40 562.35 A: consistently as they're growing so they don't end up in court either you know what i mean i know i'm changing the topic a little bit but
