60.89 61.91 A: maybe there's something 

62.92 66.27 A: scary there but i don't know it could just stir up a lot of trouble 

66.88 69.08 A: yeah uh like with both countries 

69.66 71.10 B: exactly mhm 

70.57 72.13 A: so i mean they could 

71.79 72.20 B: that's 

72.30 76.00 B: that's one of my biggest concerns too is what the other countries are going to do 

76.05 76.55 A: yeah 

76.24 82.61 B: yeah whether they're going to back us up or it looks like we already had one that backed out on us and uh 

81.94 83.10 A: uh-huh which one was that 

83.63 84.33 B: um 

84.45 88.19 B: gosh i just threw the paper away was it uh south korea 

88.04 89.60 A: oh okay okay 

88.29 97.61 B: was it yeah so they uh just thumbed their nose at us and said basically you're on your own and they're not going with the treaty anymore the peace treaty 

97.53 97.92 A: uh-huh 

98.01 103.30 B: or with the talks yeah so that was pretty alarming too s- because they're of course pretty big 

103.47 107.11 B: country over there or pretty big place but um 

104.71 105.12 A: yeah 

108.09 115.50 B: um i guess what scares me the most is is with all the terrorism and everything that we've had that if we don't go over there and do something then 

116.11 119.98 B: i mean things obviously aren't going to get any better over there either 

119.33 121.54 A: yeah i know that's really it's really a tough 

121.70 125.80 A: position to be in i think i think that's that's it's a problem you know being in a being 

123.07 123.79 B: yeah 

126.28 132.80 A: as powerful as that you know you you've got you've got some really tough decisions to make and none of them are good which ever way you go 

132.88 133.70 B: exactly 

133.30 134.46 A: kind of a bad decision 

134.48 135.38 B: yeah there's just 

135.49 137.72 B: there just no good decision in the whole thing 

137.72 141.24 A: yeah so and i was reading an article today about um 

138.24 138.67 B: righ- 

141.79 143.33 A: how this whole thing like 

143.45 144.63 A: going in there 

145.41 146.87 A: you know y- in europe 

146.97 152.53 A: a lot of countries just like hate us even more so so it's like you know they 

149.66 150.14 B: yeah 

150.39 150.96 B: yeah 

151.88 152.41 B: yeah 

152.64 152.96 A: they just 

153.21 153.68 A: think that it's 

153.80 154.64 A: bad that we're 

155.06 161.86 B: yeah because we're obviously going to kill a lot of innocent people over there and that's what they want because they don't care 

158.48 159.05 A: yeah 

159.15 159.54 A: yeah 

161.66 162.19 A: yeah 

162.25 169.65 B: they don't care that's what they want they want us to go over there and kill innocent people so they can say we killed innocent people and then make us look that much worse 

162.34 162.65 A: yeah 

166.65 167.70 A: yeah right 

169.51 170.00 A: yeah 

173.38 173.82 A: yeah 

179.26 181.22 B: and you know the economy is just 

181.40 184.64 B: really going down hill and i think that has a lot to do with it 

185.37 191.41 B: and i mean just everybody i know is just really in a pinch and they're really worried about money and 

190.81 191.30 A: yeah 

191.46 191.91 A: yeah 

192.27 193.72 A: yeah i'm definitely in that situation 

192.46 192.88 B: and 

193.73 196.44 B: huh same here too 

195.65 198.47 A: do you think that um do you think that oil is a big 

198.73 199.38 A: think like 

199.84 200.84 A: one reason we're go- 

200.99 202.38 A: we might go in there is because 

202.76 203.56 A: we want oil 

205.21 205.88 B: um 

206.05 209.38 B: no i don't think that has a lot to do with it 

209.55 210.37 B: because 

211.47 213.24 B: um i've always heard that we 

213.51 217.09 B: were basically able to supply a lot of our oil 

223.19 225.27 B: and i think that the government will probably 

225.77 234.44 B: uh want that money more so than to want to have to give it to somebody else you know over seas so i d- i don't think that's as much of 

231.83 232.21 A: uh-huh 

235.05 238.82 B: i'm i'm sure it has a lot to do with it because obviously we don't want the 

239.35 243.25 B: the wars over the gas and petroleum and all that 

242.90 243.28 A: yeah 

243.37 244.01 B: but um 

244.74 251.80 B: i think a lot of it probably has to do with the terrorism and like they say the the nucle- the threat of a the nuclear threat 

252.47 254.38 B: you know that comes from over there too 

254.46 254.86 A: yeah 

255.06 255.57 B: um 

255.81 257.09 A: yeah i think that um 

257.71 259.77 A: that the administration now kind of sees 

259.94 261.47 A: that you know they can you know 

261.71 261.99 A: that it's 

262.08 265.56 A: not that hard really probably and it's a good time to go in you know and just 

265.81 266.64 A: get it over with 

266.83 267.73 A: because 

267.95 268.39 B: yeah 

268.14 273.60 A: you know afghanistan kind of went okay you know that that wasn't as hard as we thought and now so you know maybe we 

273.73 274.02 A: do this 

274.31 274.62 A: too 

275.03 275.67 B: yeah 

276.58 286.64 B: and maybe they're hoping if they go in there and get it over with that eventually it'll will boost the economy before it does actually get any worse but i don't know i just seem to think that 

283.35 283.75 A: uh-huh 

286.93 293.41 B: i don't know history just repeats itself it just seems like so many times you know over the years and i just think we're 

293.55 298.06 B: we're headed toward the bad one and i'm really not a pessimistic person and i 

298.52 307.70 B: i just get this feeling that we're headed for a bad one we're headed for a bad war we're going to see a lot more terrorism uh money's going to become tight i think 

307.82 316.67 B: you know families are going to start doubling up more um i think you're going to see a lot more uh extended families than what we see now 

316.86 318.76 B: and i think that's eventually going to 

319.12 324.21 B: maybe eventually on down the line maybe not in my lifetime but 

324.33 324.73 B: might 

325.08 331.77 B: um actually lead to a good thing because you're gong to have the extended families you're going to have more people 

331.89 338.80 B: telling these kids to shut up get a job you know instead of uh 

334.87 335.39 A: uh-huh 

335.69 336.17 A: uh-huh 

336.82 337.37 A: yeah 

337.95 343.01 A: yeah and maybe like more of a safety net too like you know people will take care of other people yeah 

340.09 341.23 B: exactly 

341.48 342.41 B: exactly 

342.61 344.05 B: yeah but i 

344.22 345.58 B: unfortunately uh 

345.76 353.87 B: i guess i've always thought that you had to get the really bad before you could get the good and i think that things are going to get really bad before they do get better 

354.97 356.77 A: well i hope that doesn't happen but 

356.42 358.78 B: i i certainly hope not either 

359.42 360.91 B: i certainly hope not either 

360.79 363.97 A: so they were asking do you think there will ever be peace in the middle east 

365.51 369.52 B: no i just don't think it's ever meant to be there's too many 

370.64 371.42 B: too many 

371.65 372.32 B: people 

372.89 374.64 B: involved in the peace that 

374.82 378.43 B: i- too many people involved in the process to make peace 

377.13 377.54 A: mhm 

378.47 378.91 A: yeah 

378.82 385.43 B: in the middle east and i think with that many different people involved that it's it's just never going to be it's just not meant to be 

379.81 380.21 A: yeah 

385.43 385.83 A: yeah 

386.66 388.47 A: i think that they i mean yeah it's 

388.60 394.33 A: tr- like so many centuries there's been war and stuff there but and i think that like one key is probably education i think a lot of 

394.52 395.54 A: people there aren't 

395.70 397.29 A: educated they're just like 

397.80 398.05 A: they're s- 

398.19 401.18 A: so into religion but maybe not so much into like 

401.65 402.96 B: they're backwards 

401.76 402.19 A: general 

402.74 403.68 A: yeah right 

403.26 405.47 B: yeah they're just backwards mhm 

404.85 405.24 A: yeah 

405.51 408.93 A: and so there's like no real general education so they kind of 

409.42 409.92 B: yeah 

409.96 410.24 A: don't 

410.69 411.45 A: aren't aware of 

411.37 414.59 B: unfortunately they're just not as evolved or not as 

415.32 415.64 B: uh 

415.92 416.87 B: well they're they're just 

417.18 421.54 B: i don't know for lack of a better word backwards i guess 

421.77 422.33 A: yeah 

423.08 425.01 A: yeah so what d- what do you do in ohio 

425.11 435.68 B: um right now well i was involved in retail for about twelve years but right now i'm i'm just sitting home not doing anything i got tired of all the long hours and 

429.87 430.20 A: uh-huh 

434.75 435.13 A: uh-huh 

435.85 436.56 B: all the 

436.94 437.50 B: weird 

437.69 438.85 B: hours and 

439.37 441.20 B: different shifts so 

440.91 441.25 A: yeah 

441.64 441.98 A: yeah 

442.51 443.36 B: how -bout you 

443.05 446.04 A: i'm um i teach english as a second language 

446.21 450.96 B: oh really oh great 

446.63 448.26 A: at yeah at indiana university 

449.14 450.36 A: so 

450.52 458.32 A: yeah so like that's that's really tough for us because you know like w- a lot of our students we don't have as many students as before because like the visa requirements 

458.48 460.79 A: tough to get into the country it really is tougher 

459.76 461.68 B: oh gosh yeah 

461.38 463.92 A: so that's really putting a pinch on my job 

464.07 465.25 B: oh i bet 

464.61 464.99 A: and 

465.22 466.15 A: yeah that's tough 

466.25 471.44 A: i might be actually i'm thinking about moving to canada becau- -se i have a friend there and 

469.49 470.10 B: oh 

471.64 475.18 A: the students go there now because it's easier for them to get into canada so 

477.20 477.68 A: so 

478.21 478.61 A: yeah 

485.11 495.94 B: and uh my daughter she's a senior this year she was telling me that some of her teachers were just saying ah don't worry about it i'm not going to be here next year anyway i don't care 

495.23 497.22 A: yeah that's really 

496.06 496.52 B: and 

497.56 498.98 B: and i thought well it's l- um 

497.66 498.04 A: bad 

499.10 501.77 B: you know it's lucky for her that she knows 

501.88 508.79 B: um the material and she kno- and she's a smart girl and knows what's going on but it's just too bad really that 

509.23 512.73 B: and i can understand really why they feel that way 

512.24 512.62 A: mhm 

512.94 514.48 B: you know that's terrible 

514.25 514.69 A: yeah 

514.81 515.13 B: and 

515.50 518.26 A: well yeah i guess if you know pay isn't good and 

523.03 523.49 A: uh-huh 

523.90 534.63 B: and they've past so many levies over the years we just have brand new schools here and there and just everything you know state of the art and just 

527.04 527.42 A: uh-huh 

534.96 536.51 B: beautiful schools 

536.63 542.10 B: but now they're saying they just don't have enough money to pay the teachers and nobody wants to come off of any more money 

539.64 540.06 A: uh-huh 

542.04 542.86 A: yeah 

543.01 543.37 A: yeah the 

543.41 545.94 B: and it's really unfortunate because uh 

543.49 543.81 A: tough 

546.28 548.20 B: they have some wonderful teachers here 

548.26 548.62 A: yeah 

548.85 550.08 B: i hate to see that happen
