12.84 13.86 A: okay i 

14.07 14.76 A: basically 

14.90 15.31 A: um 

15.48 18.68 A: i've flown a couple of times i guess since september eleventh and um 

19.29 21.98 A: i do think that the measures they put in place 

22.32 24.79 A: have um have an effect but 

25.14 29.90 A: to a small degree i think that uh the people running these machines and and checking people out are only human 

30.03 30.67 A: and that uh 

31.41 31.84 A: (( )) 

31.98 32.62 A: and i believe 

32.77 34.30 A: they won't catch everything 

35.31 39.58 B: i agree i've actually flown quite a few times since september eleventh and 

39.77 42.14 B: i've at first i think everyone was much uh 

42.55 44.81 B: was very agreeable and able to uh 

45.24 51.87 B: to handle the delays and that sort of thing and i think that less got through at first and now i think that people are just sort of starting relaxing a little bit 

52.34 57.36 B: and i mean i know i've gotten through with a nail file that i didn't know i had on and you know and little things like that 

58.13 59.77 B: uh is bound to slip through 

60.04 60.63 A: yeah the only 

60.77 62.63 A: i guess the only airport that i've actually noticed 

63.18 67.00 A: um heightened security would be flying back into washington national 

67.07 67.52 B: mhm 

67.50 70.17 A: it seems i've flown in from i guess j._f._k. and 

70.70 75.68 A: they wouldn't even let us in the gate area until a half hour before departure time 

75.76 76.30 B: oh wow 

76.16 76.70 A: and then 

76.84 80.76 A: they've checked everybody's passports again like whatever coming into the gate and then 

80.95 83.46 A: wouldn't let you leave the gate once you were in so 

83.26 83.62 B: right 

83.56 84.14 A: i guess they 

84.42 85.27 A: they still have uh 

85.60 88.69 A: uh heightened security for for washington national airport but uh 

89.13 92.44 A: especially others i've noticed the same thing the delays have been very minimal 

92.53 93.24 A: recently 

93.29 93.87 B: yes 

93.55 94.00 A: that uh 

94.15 100.52 B: and you would like to attribute that to them getting a little better so they are a little faster at going through everything but 

101.47 106.08 B: i mean they are not screening everyone in every step of the way and that would really be the only way to 

106.11 106.53 A: sure 

106.46 108.58 B: to stop everything and that's just unrealistic 

108.77 118.90 A: yeah i i guess one other thing i noticed recently too it seems like they do a lot of profiling though at these airports at before they you know who they check to pull apart for their uh or pull aside for their 

119.05 120.21 A: um individual 

120.72 122.75 A: searches and things and i i noticed that 

123.18 123.55 A: you know 

123.94 126.93 A: standing in line that most of the people that i would check you know if i was 

125.25 125.84 B: mhm 

127.12 127.47 A: going to 

127.67 129.19 A: dare say i'd check somebody 

128.95 129.33 B: right 

129.37 130.62 A: most of them do get uh 

130.75 131.94 A: pulled over and looked at 

131.64 132.37 B: oh really 

132.10 133.12 A: (( )) yeah 

133.18 141.79 B: i noticed that the first few times that i flew but the i really actually haven't paid attention the last few times for that matter either so it may just be that i didn't notice 

139.02 139.33 A: yeah 

141.63 145.38 A: well there is always this one it seems like there's always the one token family member you know 

145.43 146.12 B: yeah 

145.56 147.18 A: who some grandma who is 

147.29 150.30 A: just showing hey we are doing it to to everybody but uh it's 

149.26 150.11 B: right 

151.02 159.51 B: actually the very first time that i flew after september eleventh there was a woman who was just she had gotten pulled over for a random search and was just so indignant 

159.93 161.17 B: about the whole process 

161.48 168.58 B: and you could see why she got pulled over -cause she had all these bundles of like jackets and bags and everything in her arms and so it would be very easy to have just about anything in there 

166.49 166.74 A: (( )) 

169.02 171.72 B: and she was just are you saying i'm a terrorist and 

172.13 173.66 B: just completely 

173.84 177.55 B: freaking out and it was probably about it was in december and so it was just a few months after that happened 

178.06 181.69 B: and it was just you know have you been no actually i really wasn't 

178.11 179.88 A: were you were you nervous about flying 

182.31 183.18 B: i really wasn't 

183.74 189.57 B: i figu- at that point i you know whatever is going to happen is going to happen is sort of my feeling if it's your time it's your time and 

186.68 187.10 A: sure 

190.46 192.40 B: i mean definitely there was sort of uh 

192.95 197.56 B: i don't know a heightened tension i guess but uh i wasn't necessarily afraid 

194.89 195.21 A: yeah 

197.47 200.37 A: yeah well when you look at how many flights there are per day 

200.26 200.95 B: right 

200.71 202.77 A: and and the chances are very slim i guess 

202.67 203.12 B: right 

204.18 207.78 B: so you know hey and i wanted to go on the trip so 

207.05 208.16 A: you wan- you said what 

208.09 211.48 B: i wanted to go on the trip so you know that outweighed everything 

209.10 210.23 A: you wanted to go yeah 

211.26 218.39 A: that makes a big difference when it's when it's for work and you have to fly from washington to california or something like that but then you don't want to be there or something 

212.59 213.67 B: uh definite- yeah 

216.75 221.93 B: yeah actually i hadn't i hadn't even considered that of people who had to fly for business and so were forced to 

219.30 219.71 A: yeah 

222.01 222.46 A: yeah 

222.56 223.07 B: to do it 

222.63 225.46 A: well i think there's been a drop off and i know right after the uh 

225.82 227.50 A: right after the attacks there was um 

227.60 234.18 A: um e. mails going around that all travel would be optional if you were afraid or didn't want to or for some reason didn't want to you know 

234.66 239.10 A: regretted going if you were given a good chance out but i think that's kind of relaxed itself too 

239.13 240.01 B: uh exactly 

239.56 243.03 A: i don't really see people afraid to fly anymore no one really says that 
240.68 241.04 B: yeah 

242.31 246.32 B: i see one you know every now and then i hear someone say something like that like 

246.44 247.57 B: they are still afraid 

248.12 249.87 B: and it it kind of surprises me 

250.12 250.50 A: right 

250.47 255.48 B: i have to say because it's been awhile and like i i really feel like things have sort of relaxed a little bit at least in that 

256.28 261.34 B: in recent terms of airlines and that sort of thing so i think a lot of people think that they are not going to strike if 

261.58 263.66 B: something is going to happen again it is not going to be 

264.21 266.41 B: the airlines again that they are going to try something different 

266.50 266.89 A: right 

266.90 267.46 B: so 

268.44 270.87 A: think that's pretty much the case everybody is starting to feel 

271.91 275.16 B: yeah if they were going to do something they would have done it by now sort of thing but 

276.41 276.89 A: and 

276.52 278.62 B: well you never know so 

277.99 281.75 A: yeah i know you say this and then the next day in the newspaper there will be some report 

281.81 282.65 B: exactly 

282.16 283.59 A: they caught somebody or whatever but 

283.87 286.58 B: or what that code saying with the colors and 

287.11 287.54 A: yeah 

287.12 289.00 B: all the little government warnings coming out 

289.31 291.29 A: so you think they went overboard with all their uh 

291.74 294.82 A: with their screening processes putting the locks on the doors and things like that 

295.30 296.45 B: you know 

296.57 298.31 B: i guess it's good to have some sort of 

298.76 300.18 B: standard practice 

300.34 301.76 B: in line to begin with 

302.32 302.77 B: but 

303.33 304.23 B: i don't know 

304.97 307.70 B: see it's hard to say they went overboard considering what happened 

307.83 308.28 A: sure 

308.40 309.52 B: you know but 

310.66 313.08 B: i don't know i just don't think you can live your life on the edge 

313.69 314.33 A: do you think that 

313.78 317.80 B: like that like you know on the edge of your seat like what's going to happen if this person (( misses it )) you know 

317.98 318.37 A: right 

318.30 318.60 B: i just 

318.89 320.10 B: and it's not a way to live 

320.23 321.68 A: do you think the idea of giving 

321.79 323.50 A: guns to the pilots is a good idea 

323.64 324.16 B: no 

324.22 324.52 A: no 

325.09 328.67 A: (( )) you want to keep all weapons off of the plane that's the whole point 

327.70 333.96 B: i just you know if there's a marshal or a police officer or something like that on there then fine but i mean pilots are not trained 

334.45 335.55 B: for that sort of thing 

335.95 339.16 B: and so i m- even if they were i don't know it just doesn't seem 

339.14 340.32 A: it doesn't seem like a wise move 

340.35 344.39 B: no and then someone comes in and takes the pilots gun if they didn't have one and 

344.98 348.70 B: you know -cause they didn't they couldn't sneak through uh security with one so they figure they would just 

349.24 350.35 B: take the pilot's and 

351.34 354.80 A: so have you heard a lot of stories about people who say they know some one or did or that 

354.91 358.89 A: was able to walk on with guns or whatever whether it be a marshal or who whatnot 

363.99 364.47 A: right 

368.38 374.94 B: and i do know some people who have you know saying they've been caught with like nail clippers or something you know little like that but i haven't heard of anything 

375.15 375.95 A: yeah after 

375.50 377.34 B: like knives or guns or anything so 

376.85 381.61 A: i think it it was after a flight we were waiting for a long lay over and uh 

381.88 382.59 A: one of the guys 

382.94 386.80 A: uh his friend approached him and it got known that he was a marshal or whatever and 

386.65 387.32 B: mhm 

387.13 398.24 A: he started telling him about some stories about different airports where you know he checked his gun and it went right through the the screener and they didn't stop and after the fact he would tell them you know you should really look in that bag a little closer 

395.76 396.32 B: wow 

398.15 398.62 B: yeah 

398.42 403.87 A: you know and there would be rounds of ammunition so that's just where i start wondering you know how human is this 

404.24 407.47 B: right right and well i suppose it took a long time too 

404.30 405.56 A: process you know 

407.73 413.20 B: to train all the people that they wanted to train and there was talk about unionization and that sort of thing 

412.47 414.54 A: well federalization they were bringing federal workers 

413.43 414.64 B: right right 

415.05 415.44 A: do that 

415.16 415.56 B: so 

416.55 420.58 B: you know exactly so it's just a you know a regular joe like you and i 

420.89 424.87 B: doing his thing there at the airport is just a regular job and if he is having a bad day 

425.04 427.57 A: yes and if you do anything over and over and 

425.15 426.25 B: you know 

426.68 430.05 B: he was out partying last night and isn't quite paying attention then 

429.49 429.91 A: right 

430.95 438.04 A: right and if your job is to do the same thing over and over and over again then you know you'll have diminishing returns in your day on how well you can do that 

433.86 435.38 B: ex- yeah how 

436.85 438.45 B: exactly exactly 

438.96 442.01 B: i actually have a friend who uh works at logan airport 

442.96 445.99 B: and yeah and he still won't fly out of that airport 

446.28 446.71 A: really 

446.71 453.43 B: he's no he just doesn't trust it he doesn't like there's just so many people and so many so (( )) joe schmo sort of thing on the street and he just says 

453.89 457.57 B: it's just too easy he goes i could bring a bomb in there tomorrow and no one would realize it 

457.83 459.48 A: right but that you know the the whole 

459.07 462.25 B: but i i that's what i said i said well how true is that of anywhere 

462.19 465.63 A: right go to the mall here stay away from the malls and those kinds of things it's just 

466.48 466.85 A: (( )) 

475.28 478.94 B: every other week oh this flight is going to do this there are all these warnings and 

479.20 479.70 A: sure 

479.33 482.18 B: they are going to strike at the mall of america they are going to strike here 

482.19 485.78 A: well whatever someone could think of that was the next place basically so 

483.98 488.80 B: yeah you know all these massive e. mails going oh this one this and 

489.10 489.67 B: yeah 

489.50 491.14 A: i certainly don't miss all that going away 

490.81 495.74 B: no i don't not at all it's not and to that respect it's nice that things have relaxed a little bit 

495.92 496.55 A: that's right 

496.70 497.05 B: but 

497.75 499.50 B: i guess there's a trade off there so 

501.00 501.27 B: but 

502.79 503.19 A: (( )) 

502.80 505.08 B: so how many times have you traveled 

504.43 505.01 A: um 

505.21 506.63 A: since then um 

506.73 509.27 A: just a handful under five for sure 

509.22 509.61 B: yeah 

509.95 510.44 A: but um 

510.59 511.95 B: and for work or for pleasure 

511.86 513.83 A: they are always for work unfortunately so 

512.83 514.40 B: oh that's no fun um 

514.13 514.83 A: no no 

515.02 515.46 A: but uh 

517.01 519.54 A: w- i live down in the washington area so 

519.33 521.55 B: oh so that actually was probably quite heightened
