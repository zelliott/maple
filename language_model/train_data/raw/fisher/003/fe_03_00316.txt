88.21 88.57 A: right 

88.74 90.47 B: so i i draw pretty 

91.15 93.26 B: conservative lines because 

93.81 95.52 B: humor can pretty deadly 

95.81 96.97 A: yeah that's pretty good though

100.51 100.95 A: yeah 

101.91 102.59 A: my uh

110.41 112.64 A: borderline annoying but um 

111.61 111.99 B: uh-huh 

112.88 113.55 A: and he 

113.82 123.47 A: e- also (( )) like his (( )) i was talking to him about it the other day just we were joking around and uh he also kind of said that you know like he'll make plays on words and he'll make jokes about 

117.46 117.83 B: uh-huh 

124.18 129.47 A: things and media and stuff like that but he he also doesn't want to make it personal ever 

125.66 126.05 B: uh-huh 

128.54 129.07 B: right 

129.64 132.25 A: so

130.09 132.43 B: well if i make it personal i joke about myself 

132.95 135.43 B: because i know i know like what my own little things are but 

133.10 134.29 A: (( yeah )) 

135.97 137.09 B: uh 

138.36 140.68 B: yeah you just have to be really i mean words words have power to 

141.47 144.62 B: just create and destroy a lot like i one of the things i 

145.29 146.57 B: talked about with um 

147.38 151.74 B: when i was first starting to date was that i i wouldn't even joke about breaking up or about 

152.24 157.85 B: liking other women whatever just because i wanted to be real careful about not even speaking into areas that i 

158.45 159.15 B: you know that that i would 

160.06 161.49 B: didn't want to affirm so 

161.53 162.16 A: right 

161.97 164.76 B: jus- just there are certain things that i don't think are appropriate to joke about 

164.77 165.18 A: yeah 

165.35 165.68 B: um 

167.21 167.64 A: um

203.26 205.20 B: if people kind of tend to and also you just 

205.31 215.53 B: you make it a point to be reconciled with people real quickly like if you think you've said something off color then you try to address it pretty soon and (( )) just kind of let it go for a while but 

208.11 208.86 A: yeah 

210.97 212.45 A: yeah

445.82 447.68 B: pay them in uh food or something 

447.64 451.93 A: eh right i don't know i just wonder what 

452.11 459.35 A: like what they're going to actually do with this and i feel kind of bad for the person who has to sit there and listen to all the conversations 

457.76 462.49 B: well i bet it's something they they uh just time like how long you talk about the topic or something (( )) 

462.43 465.80 A: maybe 

463.09 466.05 B: they have people talk about difficult issues for longer or if they
