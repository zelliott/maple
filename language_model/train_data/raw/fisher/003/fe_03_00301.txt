32.37 34.67 B: no i haven't thought it is either um 

35.13 37.81 B: i mean it takes a little more time but it's not really a big deal

53.59 53.93 B: so 

54.06 58.69 B: i mean and we've i've flown across the country a few times since then and so i i don't think it's 

58.89 60.39 B: we haven't seen that much of a difference 

60.75 61.09 A: right 

61.80 62.15 B: but 

62.48 63.27 A: sometimes it's not as 

63.80 65.72 A: not as big a concern i mean 

65.95 67.87 A: i don't know my sister is in the navy and i kind of ah 

68.18 72.44 A: i worry about dif- different things i guess than airport security but 

71.89 79.76 B: i worry about the plane crashing you know i mean little things like that that used to concern people really aren't that much of a concern anymore but they're still there 

74.02 74.84 A: yeah 

80.86 81.52 B: um 

81.86 84.59 B: i don't know do you think it'll help to do all this added stuff 

85.04 88.16 B: do they screen your bags before you um even check in 

88.50 90.73 A: they do check -em but it's not ah 

88.65 88.97 B: (( )) 

90.83 91.66 A: i don't know i don't think 

92.91 96.64 A: there there's some messed up things about this like i went to an economics (( )) just about a month ago 

103.09 105.39 A: their own liabilities this would be something that their you know 

107.89 108.98 A: the airport um 

109.13 112.53 A: who is ah the president of i think american airlines who was saying that you know 

112.94 113.74 A: this should be 

118.20 122.94 B: so everybody else is kind of e- everybody is trying to kind of pass responsibility on to other people 

118.59 119.06 A: i didn- 

123.16 123.48 A: yeah 

123.50 125.17 B: it sounds like yeah 

125.78 126.31 B: yeah 

126.65 128.77 A: i don't know i i just kind of thought that was kind of 

130.06 132.22 A: childish on their part to say you know okay 

132.56 135.31 A: their racist even you know they're pushing the blame on to other people but 

135.43 137.18 A: same time they're not worried about you know 

137.93 142.62 A: they've never made a loss basically until now when you know u._a._l. just went bankrupt early this year 

142.77 144.13 A: earlier this week actually 

144.23 144.58 B: yeah 

144.88 145.24 A: but 

145.88 147.10 A: pretty funny to see what they do 

147.45 151.09 B: it is interesting i don't know where the responsibility should lie should 

151.60 153.63 B: be a combination of everybody to 

153.73 154.75 B: to cure it but 

155.34 156.55 B: there's so many other ways 

157.74 158.86 B: there is so many other 

160.26 161.61 B: methods of 

161.77 162.82 B: of 

163.00 165.36 B: terrorism and things like that to 

166.14 166.72 B: um 

167.10 172.64 B: to worry about that i mean i think that just concentrating on one primarily probably isn't the best idea 

172.77 173.19 B: i don't know 

174.02 175.82 A: well one of the biggest things you need to worry about 

179.76 180.35 B: (( )) 

179.87 181.02 A: there's so much stuff that doesn't 

181.69 185.41 A: blocked and so many it's only one percent of the ah force actually gets secured 

185.53 187.16 B: most definitely yeah eh it 

187.31 191.04 B: we can i mean it's it's very obvious to us in portland um 

191.17 193.18 B: with everything coming in from the um 

193.74 194.60 B: the pacific 

195.23 195.68 B: um 

195.99 196.84 B: up the river 

196.99 197.62 B: i mean (( )) 

197.34 207.45 A: mhm yeah you guys had that issued about you know about a month ago when the ah the portsmen took that strike so much stuff was backed up so much stuff could have gone on right there 

197.72 198.83 B: -thing could happen like that 

204.22 205.16 B: exactly 

207.63 210.54 B: it's just an incredible impact on the economy too 

211.52 212.44 B: so yeah it 

219.19 220.06 B: yeah because of 

220.34 221.42 B: because of that 

221.77 229.15 B: you know two week strike and so it is it's it's the it's the combination of all the different (( )) 

229.64 235.57 B: varies of transportation and economy that just interact when they effect one another 

235.98 236.31 B: so 

236.58 236.93 B: yeah 

242.42 242.95 B: the which 

245.18 245.90 B: are coming down 

246.43 247.01 B: yeah they are 

253.14 253.85 B: that's super 

254.93 264.80 B: that's super yeah we actually yeah we flew to montana for thanksgiving and it was relatively cheaper it's usually very expensive because there's three flights that go in and out of there 

264.72 265.04 A: mhm 

265.27 268.45 B: but um yeah it's getting cheaper to fly but i don't know how 

268.57 270.26 B: how that's going to effect the 

270.50 271.80 B: the business end of 

271.90 272.30 B: the 

272.55 273.44 B: the airlines 

274.33 274.77 B: you know

293.96 294.33 B: (( )) 

296.49 297.73 B: yeah no kidding

338.14 339.21 B: pilots have the firearms 

340.13 340.55 B: when we

364.68 365.23 B: like reason 

366.01 368.16 B: but i think there's a lot we don't know about it 

372.45 375.46 B: exactly in many many different areas 

376.14 376.51 B: (( )) 

378.37 378.72 B: yeah 

381.54 382.71 B: yeah to a certain extent 

385.36 385.91 B: yeah 

386.02 386.44 B: yeah 

390.71 392.60 B: so i don't know how long these are supposed to be 

394.51 394.97 B: ten minutes 

397.82 398.33 B: yeah 

398.66 398.91 B: well 

400.41 403.42 B: actually i uh just got my m._a. in linguistics 

404.45 405.09 B: (( )) 

407.26 407.76 B: so i got my 

407.91 411.34 B: (( )) in linguistics and then it just went through on the list serve from the university that i went 

411.45 411.75 B: to 

412.42 413.08 B: thought it would be int- 

413.59 414.10 B: how about you 

414.41 415.09 B: you're in economics 

416.83 417.60 B: through which list serve 

419.15 419.86 B: okay yeah 

420.75 422.96 B: it was passed on to our list serve so you got it through penn 

423.31 424.28 B: are you an alumni at penn 

427.03 427.29 B: oh 

428.55 428.80 B: so 

433.96 438.04 B: you think that they should do like random checks or do you think they should check all the baggage 

444.99 446.10 B: yeah random or 

449.19 449.80 B: mhm 

452.89 455.09 B: yeah that's kind of a loaded situation 

458.45 462.33 B: oh yeah definitely i don't think anyb- sorry about that 

462.75 464.12 B: i don't think anybody is is 

465.58 465.99 B: i mean 

466.92 468.71 B: it's not like we're complaining about it but 

469.57 471.87 B: it's just i don't know whether it's random or you know 

472.38 475.26 B: you get in to the whole issue of the profiling and 

476.12 477.42 B: (( )) a hard decision 

477.95 482.68 A: it just means that they actually they can't like produce the movies now that have you know 

482.94 488.94 A: people of different defense you know being terrorists and things like that kind of bothers me that they have to be that politically correct 

489.21 491.15 B: i know i know 

492.67 494.72 B: it it is it's difficult to i mean 

495.02 495.95 B: i think that they should 

496.32 497.52 B: (( )) all of them 

498.74 502.98 B: rather than randomly because there so the i mean the statistics that go with it are just 

504.51 506.61 B: better to check all of them but there's so much 

506.81 508.55 B: they're so much that it would be 

508.87 510.63 B: nearly impossible to function 

510.99 511.28 A: right 

515.80 517.93 A: i think we do it for over ten minutes 

517.54 518.26 B: alright 

518.28 523.11 A: yeah so i don't know if it would end or not or if we should just hang up or 

521.86 524.59 B: i don't know if we have to push the buttons or i don't know 

524.70 526.26 B: (( )) anyway um 

526.76 529.29 B: have a good flight and happy holidays and all that stuff 

530.71 531.35 B: alright bye 

531.35 531.63 A: bye bye
