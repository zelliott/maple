0.95 1.66 A: hi my name 

1.01 1.77 B: hi i'm sean 

2.10 3.29 A: hi sean my name is david 

3.60 3.95 B: hi there 

4.28 4.84 A: how you doing 

5.05 5.35 B: good 

8.54 9.02 A: how about you 

9.25 10.09 B: ah the second 

10.55 10.89 A: okay 

11.08 11.70 B: technically 

11.15 15.31 A: well do we just introduce ourselves and then hit the button or do we talk about this 

15.09 16.46 B: uh talk about this i believe 

16.81 18.03 A: ah and they are recording it 

18.35 19.18 B: i believe so 

21.12 21.43 A: okay 

21.14 24.34 B: yeah you just keep going and till they say stop i guess 

24.57 27.41 A: so we don't activate anything they just time us or something 

27.60 27.98 B: yeah 

28.45 29.35 B: i forget how long 

29.69 30.10 A: okay 

31.03 32.00 B: but uh hm 

33.53 34.44 A: if you want to go first 

34.54 35.79 B: uh yeah might as well 

37.33 42.56 B: ah lessons yeah i believe it lessons i don't think it eliminates anything 

44.18 44.61 B: i think that 

44.97 47.07 B: i think it's tougher for them to get through but 

48.86 49.31 A: yeah 

49.87 50.43 A: yeah i think 

51.08 53.48 A: it's going to be tougher for them to get through they're going to 

53.77 55.75 A: ah have to come with better ways to 

56.05 57.25 A: terrorize people and 

57.97 58.86 A: however uh 

60.02 62.84 A: i mean the root cause of this stuff is probably has nothing to do with 

64.44 66.17 A: security in my opinion it's just 

66.97 67.25 A: um 

68.74 70.79 A: miscommunication misunderstanding it's 

71.70 72.39 A: ah 

72.82 74.26 A: i mean it's the whole thing about 

75.30 76.27 A: u._s. oil and 

76.86 78.00 A: u._s. overseas and 

78.32 79.86 A: military presence overseas 

80.23 82.72 A: which i can understand aggravates a lot of people because 

83.36 85.39 A: i thing the only reason the military is overseas is 

85.54 86.82 A: for corporate interests here 

87.88 88.42 B: hm 

88.50 89.74 A: that's probably the way it's always been 

100.18 101.11 B: well 

109.83 112.70 A: the heightened security certainly is going to work to deter in the short term 

114.85 118.19 A: however there's a lot more creative ways to terrorize people i'm sure 

117.61 123.69 B: yeah you leave them you leave them free to find new methods i'm sure they will they are creative enough 

122.50 123.07 A: i mean 

123.62 124.45 A: if you just lucky 

124.57 125.58 A: mm israel 

125.95 126.51 A: you see that 

127.26 128.22 A: people are willing 

128.80 132.40 A: drop a bomb on and run into a public place and i'm actually surprised 

132.79 133.64 A: i was just talking about 

133.80 136.40 A: this to my friend the other day i'm surprised it hasn't been done here 

137.39 137.90 A: i mean 

138.16 138.70 B: not yet 

138.95 141.55 A: that's what i mean it seems like it's 

142.42 147.20 A: it's not terribly imaginative for me to think of that it's like well duh this country 

147.93 149.37 A: you walk into a shopping mall 

149.92 150.40 B: mhm 

150.34 152.57 A: heaven forbid at christmas time i mean 

152.74 156.19 A: this would be an ideal time for them to do something cause not only would it 

156.45 158.19 A: terrorize the heck out of people there 

158.50 159.31 A: it will also 

159.72 162.83 A: possibly stop people from going shopping which would really 

162.93 163.91 A: hurt the economy 

165.13 165.92 A: and a 

165.38 171.26 B: well yeah i mean the panic would you know spread across the entire country that's that's a lot of shopping malls that 

171.14 172.41 A: it is a lot of shopping mall 

171.82 172.74 B: don't get frequented 

173.05 173.79 A: it would be 

174.38 175.55 B: just from one instance 

174.70 177.18 A: it would be advantageous to any one who really wanted 

177.31 177.88 A: hurt us 

178.21 178.69 B: mhm 

178.88 181.88 A: to do something like that it's just the airline security 

182.41 184.39 A: of course it's a huge thing cause 

184.91 187.36 A: an airline when you get on an airline you're giving up your control 

188.15 188.81 B: oh totally 

188.85 190.23 A: it's like you don't even have 

190.63 194.20 A: your will to leave anymore it's just you're just at the mercy of 

194.35 197.45 A: security and you're at the mercy of the pilot is not like you can 

197.85 200.70 A: you know i want to just take my parachute off when something happens or 

201.96 202.55 A: so 

202.34 203.97 B: yeah that's not an option 

204.47 204.86 A: yeah 

204.64 206.21 B: based on commercial flights yeah 

206.44 209.12 A: i mean if we really want to do it right 

209.22 211.62 A: the countries that have been successful i know el al 

212.69 213.31 A: has 

213.99 214.85 A: fairly phenomenal 

215.32 216.73 A: security because they have to 

217.16 217.56 B: yeah 

218.40 219.16 A: and um 

219.45 223.33 A: i don't know the details i don't know what they do i don't know if we're mimicking them in any way 

225.32 225.69 B: hm 

226.33 230.95 A: and i don't know what they've decided to do with the doors leading to the cockpit or what they decided to do with 

232.30 233.51 A: pilots with guns 

234.32 235.46 A: or not having guns 

236.77 237.38 B: hm 

241.09 241.42 A: but 

241.61 242.56 B: i think that will help them 

243.11 243.48 B: (( )) 

243.19 244.14 A: it would help the pilots 

244.37 244.72 B: yeah 

246.19 246.65 A: yeah 

246.84 247.36 A: i think 

247.85 250.20 A: i i don't know if the pilots favor it i think that 

250.45 251.21 A: overall they 

252.30 254.70 A: i i don't know what the consensus is in pilot it's just 

255.49 259.55 A: some of them probably think it (( )) some of them like it others probably think of 

255.55 256.58 B: i haven't read up on that 

260.42 261.61 A: you know bullet holes in the 

262.07 263.93 A: fuselage or through a windows 

264.80 266.73 A: not a pleasant thing either so i don't know what they 

267.41 268.23 B: hm (( )) 

267.51 268.15 A: what date (( )) 

268.40 269.36 B: not sure although i 

269.73 271.37 B: i don't know i've heard that's kind of a 

272.33 273.28 B: misconception 

275.28 276.84 A: about the misfiring you mean 

277.00 278.66 B: no you know holes in the 

278.83 279.67 B: fuselage 

280.13 280.50 A: oh 

280.88 283.67 A: like if even if they shot through the wall it wouldn't go through you mean 

284.75 286.22 B: yeah i forget exactly 

286.43 286.81 A: yeah 

288.06 289.02 B: but that is but 

290.03 290.48 B: hm 

290.03 292.82 A: it it certainly is a lovely topic to talk about it's 

293.65 295.76 B: oh yeah they've they've been pleasant um 

298.15 299.08 B: (( )) 

303.41 304.91 B: oh i don't know it's 

306.09 311.14 B: um yeah the the you know economic impact of somebody pulling (( )) 

312.76 315.74 B: i mean look what you know the the airline industry still uh 

317.99 322.08 B: still in a you know par- pardon the pun a bit of a tailspin since september eleven 

322.37 323.75 A: yeah and united airlines 

324.40 325.39 B: yeah i was about to 

326.12 327.71 B: or if they haven't already 

329.06 330.43 B: uh (( )) 

331.07 332.44 B: the bankruptcy filing 

332.71 333.13 A: yeah 

333.40 334.28 A: yeah it's 

335.33 336.95 A: it is it's it's an absolute shame 

337.47 338.08 A: that it's 

338.52 339.87 A: that it's come to this and 

340.12 340.62 A: just 

341.36 344.47 A: i i i'm not sure where i stand on it it just you get 

344.65 345.34 A: you get the um 

345.53 346.08 A: people 

346.28 348.98 A: who are very very upset when you mention anything to do with 

350.42 353.95 A: u._s. foreign policy it's not even u._s. foreign policy it's more just 

354.38 359.70 A: business in other countries foreign policy like what we do internation- through international business in other countries 

360.52 361.68 A: it seems to really upset 

361.80 362.45 A: those people 

363.11 364.05 A: and then you have 

364.48 365.43 A: camps here that 

365.87 368.73 A: say that well it's too bad i mean it's just that's the american way and 

369.55 374.16 A: you know live with it it's it's capitalism it's good for everybody and all that kind of stuff and then you have people that say well 

374.86 376.39 A: september eleventh was inevitable 

376.94 379.30 A: because america was pissing people off all over the world 

380.19 381.25 A: and it's like it's 

381.42 382.01 A: it's 

382.34 383.92 A: it's really hard to even talk about 

384.97 386.02 A: people get really 

386.62 387.84 A: emotional about it and 

389.18 391.67 A: having any kind of discussion on it is is very difficult 

393.55 396.01 A: so i know we're swaying from the topic of airline security but 

402.07 402.43 B: hm 

403.04 403.50 B: um 

403.81 406.21 B: i can't believe we're the only country with uh 

407.12 410.35 B: international present international interests 

410.53 413.15 A: no no but our but our military presence 

412.81 415.53 B: but yeah whereas has to be the largest 

415.53 416.76 A: ours our our 

417.88 419.09 A: cor- corporate america 

419.68 420.80 A: it's really 

421.35 424.04 A: hard to put a finger on but it just seems like 

424.43 430.10 A: there is business and the business of america is business i forgot who said that like harding or coolidge or one of those guys but 

430.67 432.21 A: and it's 

432.33 432.75 A: and 

432.87 438.07 A: if any thing is going to stop internation- from our company from doing business internationally our military is going to step in 

439.04 442.47 A: or the c._i._a. or somebody is going to make it so that it's friendly to 

443.16 443.79 A: to our interest 

444.98 447.29 A: i think that's like the big difference maybe 

449.01 451.43 A: mean all the european countries of course didn't 

451.63 452.62 A: colonialists and 

453.09 453.77 A: gone in and 

454.69 456.35 A: claim countries for themselves and 

458.01 458.31 A: i don't 

458.42 460.27 A: know what goes through their minds when they are doing that but 

461.50 463.61 A: i understand that i just think america is 

465.25 466.28 A: has a bigger presence 

468.19 468.88 B: yeah they do 

469.20 474.11 A: i mean just the the consumption that we have forces us to have a bigger presence it's like we have more people and 

474.71 476.29 A: we consume a heck of a lot and 

476.81 479.36 A: of energy and gas and oil and all that kind of stuff it just 

480.03 481.84 A: kind of a no brainer that we would have 

482.56 484.26 A: military presence in the middle east 

484.95 488.92 A: and from their perspective the people who don't like america it's all they see is like 

490.10 492.75 A: to them it's like holy land and our military is there 

496.61 497.02 B: hm 

501.44 508.52 B: all i'm hoping is that something gets done to minimize the possibility of somebody pulling off a suicide bombing in a public 

509.24 509.53 A: right 

509.82 510.24 B: uh 

510.47 511.17 B: place 

511.84 514.79 B: oh within this country i mean september eleventh was bad enough 

515.00 515.35 A: yes 

515.89 517.95 B: planes dropping from the sky but 

518.14 520.36 A: and who knows what they are planning now i mean 

520.56 522.81 A: september eleventh was probably planned for years 

523.64 524.21 A: many years 

525.19 526.52 A: mean considering they had all the 

525.95 526.44 B: yeah 

526.73 531.81 A: they had all those people living in the country for awhile and they were fed money and stuff they had a big plan 

532.36 534.27 B: it was a big plan and a 

533.66 534.17 A: and um 

534.41 537.59 B: what's scary is i heard people saying it could have been worse 

534.47 534.92 A: if this 

538.53 539.01 A: yeah 

539.15 543.00 B: yeah they timed it uh you know they pulled off early morning flights 

543.88 545.16 B: to um 

546.41 549.29 B: you know to hit the towers when there wouldn't be so many people 

549.97 550.50 A: yes 

550.78 551.50 A: that's right it would 

550.97 553.12 B: they hit it at what a quarter to nine in the morning 

553.20 554.27 A: thankfully there were a lot of 

553.37 555.06 B: people are still just getting there 

555.14 557.13 A: a lot of people still getting off the subway and 

556.74 557.56 B: right 

557.92 558.36 A: um 

559.38 563.36 A: yeah and plus tours there's uh windows on the world which is on the top floor 

564.59 569.53 A: entire like mall and then you go up on the observation deck and stuff and it's a huge tourist attraction so 

569.32 569.66 B: right 

569.84 574.10 A: i'm i'm thinking that nobody was up there i don't know if windows on the world was open at 

574.31 576.67 A: quarter to nine in the morning hopefully not but 

576.47 577.42 B: doubtful yeah 

577.39 580.23 A: it's i mean all those employees were up there though it's just 

577.88 578.85 B: no point (( )) 

580.54 584.35 B: yeah the early pe- the early people but imagine if they had hit around lunch hour 

585.12 585.53 A: yeah 

586.04 586.78 A: oh yeah 

586.05 589.03 B: and stuff like that i mean yeah and that and you think about it that way 

589.17 589.64 A: it would of 

589.76 590.70 A: it would've been awful 

590.60 595.14 B: and that and that's the shaky part because you get the idea that they just kind of toying with us 

598.18 598.54 B: so 

598.23 598.68 A: well 

598.86 601.06 A: uh they probably had to do it that way 

601.20 604.12 A: to get on flights were there'd be less people maybe 

604.48 606.54 A: i i i don't know i don't remember 

606.33 611.88 B: well i have a hard time believing they they did that out of the goodness of their hearts they were i think it was just a 

612.04 613.33 A: no yeah i know it was 

612.72 618.94 B: it was a case of you know you know they were trying to destroy symbols it wasn't about killing people if i was there uh 

619.11 620.03 A: they're they're 

619.60 623.31 B: that's the point if the if that was if that was their sole motive they'd have killed more people 

623.32 627.88 A: yes exactly it was they definitely were symbols of amer- there were symbols symbols of capitalism 

628.63 630.02 A: that's that's the financial 

630.25 632.18 A: heart of the country is right there 

632.65 635.04 A: and they're just they're such targets cause they're so big and 

634.98 640.07 B: the capitalize it the the business presence the military presence as you mentioned 

639.79 640.19 A: yeah 

640.19 641.27 B: from hitting the pentagon 

641.35 641.87 A: pentagon 

642.21 643.25 B: and a 

645.30 650.69 B: i heard something the my first suspicion the third plane the one that they they they downed in pennsylvania 

651.52 653.79 B: was headed for the uh capitol building 

654.02 656.52 A: either yeah they said the capitol or or the white house 

656.32 660.35 B: i heard things saying the uh the capitol i figured the capitol because it's um 

660.39 661.26 A: more people i mean 

661.92 664.51 B: um well no it's it's a even bigger monument 

662.41 662.85 A: (( )) 

664.84 665.40 A: yeah 

665.87 667.17 A: oh it is i mean a 

666.66 670.07 B: a little bit of an easier target it's higher up obviously um 

668.01 668.33 A: yeah 

669.57 676.31 A: i've heard the white house is pretty i mean you can walk by it in d._c. and not even know you walked by it that's what somebody told me i haven't actually seen it but 

676.10 678.62 B: i yeah i've done that actually yeah you can 

678.81 679.95 A: capitol is pretty huge 

680.71 682.73 A: plus it would affect more it would affect i mean 

682.97 684.39 A: all those legislators died 

684.80 685.21 A: have a 

685.31 685.89 A: bigger effect 

686.90 689.44 B: just just the sight of yeah yeah that 

689.67 691.48 B: that whole that big dome just 

691.04 692.98 A: well it's from that from that tom clancy novel 

693.65 695.47 A: i figured the name of it but on the cover it had 

695.85 696.24 A: plane 

696.66 697.06 A: through the 

697.48 697.98 A: capitol 

698.22 698.56 B: hm 

698.89 699.31 A: in fact 

699.77 700.54 A: hollywood 

700.83 701.79 A: producers or 

701.91 704.28 A: people in hollywood creative people in hollywood are 

705.40 709.08 A: asked by the pentagon officials in the pentagon for scenarios 

709.46 710.78 A: that's that's public knowledge 

711.75 712.09 A: that 

712.58 715.58 A: hollywood is asked for scenarios because they're very imaginative 

716.31 718.54 A: and they do come up with scenarios better than
