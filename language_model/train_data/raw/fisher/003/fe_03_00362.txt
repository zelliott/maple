154.95 156.30 A: that's how this movie was it was 

156.88 158.55 A: it's like an independent film 

159.35 160.25 A: kind of uh 

160.56 165.05 A: kind of a strange movie and i wasn't really crazy about it when it was all said and done 

165.69 166.31 A: it was weird 

167.31 169.97 A: but um the the last movie you rented was what

188.40 190.07 B: it took him like three times 

190.24 190.92 B: to watch it

191.35 192.23 A: yeah i 

193.27 196.66 A: i think that's one of those movies you really have to see a l- like a few times 

196.96 197.48 A: to really 

197.98 198.73 A: understand it 

199.67 200.50 A: but did you like it

206.85 208.83 A: yeah

299.19 299.46 A: right 

299.58 307.10 A: like it's my first d._v._d. experience but i don't think it's that much different from the way i used to have it with 

306.05 310.95 B: exactly i was just about to say the same thing i got a d._v._d. too about three months ago and 

311.20 315.51 B: you know my husband was all over it like wow it sounds so great and i can't really tell the difference 

316.25 323.86 A: yeah i can't either i'm not really crazy about the whole wide screen thing that they do in a lot of but um 

324.19 329.67 A: my i have a friend who has um like a s- it's like a sixty inch t._v. or something 

330.28 332.64 A: she's got uh like a movie theater right in her house 

333.11 335.37 A: and we always go over there and watch movies a lot 

335.94 337.59 A: because she's got it all set up with like 

338.31 338.89 A: like the 

339.10 340.50 A: the really neat chairs and 

340.96 341.90 A: all that sort of stuff

382.07 383.84 A: cartoon stuff that they had cut out 

384.42 388.45 A: they had on the d._v._d. so it was fun to watch like all the extra stuff but

400.44 403.33 A: and uh monsters inc. was pretty neat 

404.07 405.44 B: yeah i liked them too 

406.70 411.06 A: my boyfriend's really into computer so he's he always wants to watch like the computer animation stuff 

411.81 418.31 A: on d._v._d. because he thinks it looks better on d._v._d. but again i can't tell (( )) 

417.85 419.22 B: i know how you feel 

419.24 424.00 A: um do they cut us of for have you ever done this before 

424.96 428.52 B: mm no so i was wondering what are they are going to do after the time limit 

428.89 429.70 A: i don't know 

429.73 431.70 B: i don't know probably they going to say something 

431.42 433.39 A: okay 

433.09 434.29 B: why is your phone ringing 

434.46 439.54 A: yeah my other phone i've got this on my my cell phone that's what i'm on right now but the other phone is 

439.90 441.57 A: but that's okay i mean that's not why i asked 

442.40 443.25 A: but um 

444.76 449.12 A: i don't know can you think of anything else about movies 

452.88 454.07 B: to go to the movies 

454.27 460.98 B: but then again once you're going then you get a bunch of stuff to eat and then (( )) there like forty bucks for the two of you for the two of you 

461.21 461.86 A: right 

461.24 462.50 B: you know and for what 

463.04 463.59 B: and 

463.93 465.60 B: the other thing that i was thinking a bout like 

465.90 467.63 B: in our city we use to have like um 

468.38 476.45 B: (( )) but it was only for a year or so because i don't know they went bankrupt or what happened but they used to have this movie theater where the served like beer and wine 

477.03 478.03 B: and you could eat there 

478.36 481.06 A: oh yeah the cinema draft house or whatever 

481.09 481.69 B: yeah 

483.22 485.33 B: yeah so that was kind of neat i kind of liked that 

485.75 486.36 A: yeah that 

487.52 489.56 A: like i'm going to like the dollar theaters 

489.80 490.22 B: mhm 

489.85 491.73 A: but wh- where i live we don't have one 

492.38 498.73 A: but where i used to live we had one and and i can see paying like three dollars for a movie but i can't see paying seven bucks for a movie 

499.04 499.42 B: right 

499.72 501.34 B: so what does your boyfriend think about that 

502.32 503.24 B: is he going with you 

509.86 512.10 A: we'll go out to dinner or something or go out 

512.25 517.46 A: do and do something else and then go and rent a movie instead of paying like the extra twenty bucks to go to the movies
