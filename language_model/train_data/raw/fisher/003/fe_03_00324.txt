60.84 63.88 A: and it was uh 

64.35 66.10 A: a case of 

66.63 70.36 A: uh sexual harassment and 

70.96 71.64 A: um 

72.21 76.69 A: i don't know you had seen your friend do something and you didn't 

76.83 78.56 A: you didn't want them to get in trouble 

77.10 77.58 B: yeah 

78.28 84.59 B: but i think i think if it involved if another person was involved especially where it really effected them i think i would have to 

83.71 84.19 A: uh-huh 

85.34 87.77 B: um be honest about what happened 

88.39 88.88 B: you know 

89.91 92.32 B: because it it is somebody else it's not just 

93.18 94.29 B: just his friend 

93.25 95.30 A: yeah mhm 

95.44 96.07 B: um 

96.56 97.81 B: i don't know what do you think 

98.44 102.72 A: well uh again i guess it all depends on the on what happened you know 

102.64 103.20 B: yeah 

103.63 104.75 A: um 

105.67 108.69 A: gosh it's so hard for me to think of a case because 

109.89 110.79 A: um 

112.72 119.66 A: i don't know i always think that that if if your friend is doing something wrong sometimes you need to 

120.11 121.98 A: um they need to get in trouble 

121.85 124.13 B: yeah and it and also i think 

124.25 125.32 B: maybe if somebody 

125.83 128.65 B: did something wrong and somebody confronted me about it i would 

128.79 130.29 B: maybe not lie for them but say 

130.52 132.40 B: you need to talk to them about that 

132.65 133.17 A: mhm 

133.14 136.80 B: (( )) guess as it got to a level where it is a court situation i would have to 

136.91 137.84 B: tell the truth but 

138.60 142.10 B: i guess maybe withholding the truth isn't necessarily lying but 

138.75 139.30 A: mhm 

142.36 145.44 A: what if you thought you were going to lose your job by telling the truth 

146.34 146.93 B: um 

149.43 151.09 B: i don't know that's a hard one 

150.29 152.90 A: especially in a bad economy huh 

152.36 153.65 B: yeah cause my husband just 

153.95 155.57 B: got laid off recently so that 

155.22 156.04 A: oh 

155.73 156.24 B: that would 

156.54 157.65 B: you know definitely 

157.81 159.13 B: be a hard decision because 

159.94 161.98 B: we're depending on my job right now so 

161.68 162.93 A: yeah exactly 

163.02 163.58 B: yeah 

164.40 165.23 B: more than just 

166.58 167.22 B: i don't know 

167.60 167.94 B: yeah 

170.81 176.85 A: if it was if it was just a question of justice and (( )) if it was somebody else's 

177.02 178.69 A: life or you know 

179.51 180.22 A: problem 

180.38 180.91 B: uh-huh 

180.77 184.88 A: then it would be easier to tell the truth but if you had to support your family and you thought that your 

185.60 190.37 A: your (( )) or what if you were testifying against the mafia 

191.37 193.28 B: yeah and you were worried about your safety 

193.27 193.95 A: yeah 

193.83 194.39 B: yeah 

194.16 195.59 A: and the safety of your family 

196.77 199.70 B: guess i'd have to do the witness protection program 

199.37 203.09 A: yeah you would hope that they would protect you 

201.79 205.19 B: yeah i would tru- i wouldn't trust them too though that's for sure 

204.76 206.59 A: yeah 

206.88 209.29 A: i it would depend on the case i guess 

208.88 209.41 B: yeah 

210.19 210.97 B: yeah i guess there's 

211.40 213.15 B: i i think as i get older too i 

213.34 214.42 B: you know i'm more 

215.23 217.99 B: you know when i was younger i would say no that's wrong bu- and 

218.47 219.85 B: you can't do that but now 

220.14 222.07 B: you know you can see more reasons why 

222.59 225.59 B: maybe it's wrong but maybe you need to do something or 

225.97 226.35 B: you know 

225.98 226.70 A: mhm 

226.49 227.40 B: or you um 

227.93 229.32 B: to survive yourself or 

239.85 240.37 B: uh-huh 

240.86 245.30 A: but if uh but now sometimes i think people need to get in trouble to like sort of make a change 

245.32 247.04 B: yeah they have to hit bottom 

247.17 247.71 A: yeah 

247.74 249.93 B: like poor winona 

249.72 255.64 A: yeah like winona well i don't think she's learned her lesson at all 

254.34 259.18 B: no i don't know but yeah that's the kind of thing where she does need to learn her lesson and 

259.55 260.81 B: the only way she's going to is 

259.65 260.23 A: yeah 

261.32 261.93 B: by going (( )) 

262.39 263.46 B: through what she went through 

263.67 268.28 A: yeah that's definitely a case where i would not perjure myself if my friend had a problem and i thought that 

268.47 270.05 A: that if they got in trouble with 

271.78 272.34 B: uh-huh 

272.45 275.09 A: then i would definitely tell the truth and 

274.96 275.51 B: yeah 

276.60 277.18 B: yeah or just 

277.50 281.16 B: uh there's someone at our work that definitely has a drinking problem and 

281.47 282.67 B: you know i just know 

283.18 284.74 B: she's not going to get better and 

285.09 287.23 B: the only way she's going to get better is if you don't 

288.22 289.79 B: enable her anymore by 

290.00 291.08 B: you know projecting 

291.45 292.10 A: mhm 

291.48 291.79 B: so 

292.23 293.65 A: by trying to cover it up or 

293.56 294.29 B: yeah or just 

294.40 295.19 B: you know saying 

295.53 297.07 B: yeah just covering it up or 

297.23 297.87 A: mhm 

297.76 300.10 B: pretending like you don't know something or 

300.64 302.11 B: you know when you do know something 

302.25 302.89 A: mhm 

303.04 303.39 B: so 

305.73 306.71 A: yep 

307.53 308.50 B: um have you done this 

308.73 309.12 B: um 

309.33 310.47 B: conversations before 

310.40 311.53 A: no 

311.15 314.42 B: oh me either i couldn't i never knew i had a pin so i had to uh 

314.03 317.54 A: i didn't either i had to call and get my pin today so 

316.69 319.38 B: they emailed it to me and i never checked that email and then 

319.28 320.64 A: oh okay 

319.80 320.17 B: you know 

320.85 321.22 B: so 

320.99 325.02 A: well i didn't even get an email so this is my first conversation 

323.79 325.53 B: yeah 

326.89 327.75 A: um 

328.02 330.25 A: i can't think of any other court cases like 

330.74 331.57 A: that are in the 

332.33 334.80 A: in the news that that we could talk about 

334.99 335.69 A: um 

335.04 335.68 B: yeah 

338.41 339.61 A: i feel like probably 

339.83 343.05 A: you know there's there's people that perjure themselves everyday 

343.34 343.92 B: yeah 

343.47 344.03 A: you know 

344.20 346.63 B: and it and they don't have a problem doing it either i'm sure 

346.67 347.28 A: yeah 

348.16 355.58 A: yeah or they yeah either they think it's not such a bad thing i mean and really how bad a thing is it it just depends on how bad the punishment is 

351.40 351.87 B: mhm 

355.70 356.23 B: yeah 

356.54 358.26 A: cause there's no definite right or 

358.38 359.82 A: or wrong here 

359.73 360.25 B: yeah 

361.05 361.61 A: (( as it )) 

362.28 364.49 B: uh yeah and i guess it depends on your own 

364.98 365.91 B: i mean i just feel like 

366.01 366.34 B: i'm 

366.45 367.33 B: i feel like i'm 

367.44 368.79 B: pretty honest but 

368.94 370.25 B: you know i've done things where i'd 

370.57 371.87 B: sneak into the movies or 

372.08 379.44 B: you know do stuff like that where i didn't have a problem morally with it and and even now i probably wouldn't have a problem morally with it but 

375.95 376.76 A: mhm 

379.69 380.85 B: i don't know it's just 

381.08 382.65 A: there's definitely levels 

382.56 383.26 B: yeah 

385.85 389.13 B: my brother he took a um i remember he in high school he 

389.30 393.15 B: he was trying to get a job at a gas station and they made him take a 

393.40 395.90 B: personality test that tested your honesty 

396.11 396.58 A: hmm 

396.45 396.90 B: and 

397.42 400.18 B: you know they asked him things like would you sneak into movies and 

400.64 403.47 B: he was honest and said yeah but because he was honest 

403.80 405.40 B: he didn't get the job so 

404.67 406.18 A: he didn't get the job because of that 

406.37 408.64 B: well i think so i mean they i don't think he 

408.87 409.56 B: you know he didn't 

409.73 410.33 B: fail there 

410.58 411.23 B: test but 

411.40 412.10 B: you know if 

412.60 414.55 B: how many people are going to answer that 

414.95 416.55 B: honestly that they're not going to 

416.52 428.14 A: oh yeah nobody would answer that honestly that's interesting cause i always figured if you answered all the quest- if you lied about all all tho- those things and came out perfect they wouldn't hire you because they knew you were lying 

417.20 418.33 B: yeah raise some kind of 

419.60 420.01 B: (( )) 

426.57 431.25 B: yeah i would think so too but that's why it's it's kind of ironic i think those tests you know they just 

431.30 431.73 A: yeah 

431.79 435.72 B: they don't really test your honesty i guess because you can lie so easily on them 

433.63 434.18 A: mhm 

435.89 436.50 A: mhm 

437.47 439.12 A: yeah that's really a pretty bad test 

439.43 440.18 B: yeah 

440.13 444.76 A: well how how bad is perjury anyway i mean what happens to you if you perjure yourself 

445.01 449.51 B: well i don't know i guess that i guess we like those enr- you know all the corporate guys 

449.62 451.43 B: i guess that's pretty bad you know they 

451.79 454.55 A: oh yeah that that whole enron thing 

452.71 453.06 B: they 

453.79 456.40 B: yeah or just uh you know martha stewart and 

456.99 457.75 B: you know i think 

458.46 461.44 B: she's she'd do better definitely for what she did and 

461.69 462.18 B: um 

461.91 462.86 A: yeah 

462.46 463.85 B: so did those other guys and 

464.98 466.61 B: you know they were just greedy i guess 

473.47 476.99 A: she just happened to sell a whole bunch of one thing at one time 

477.03 478.66 B: yeah i think so but 

478.87 482.49 B: i think she she either timed it really badly or she 

482.69 485.43 B: she knew and i i think she probably knew what sh- 

485.58 486.19 B: you know that 

486.07 487.92 A: she may have known she may have known 

487.16 487.46 B: (( )) 

488.09 488.79 B: and uh 

489.13 491.08 B: you know she she's in a position where 

491.64 494.04 B: first of all that much money doesn't really matter to her 

493.86 496.84 A: it does matter to them though 

494.73 495.09 B: and 

495.93 497.97 B: i know well obviously it does but 

506.58 510.88 A: the i guess the the pritt family who owns uh 

511.73 512.12 A: hyatt 

512.35 513.29 A: hotels 

513.17 513.67 B: uh-huh 

522.76 523.27 B: mhm 

528.17 532.48 A: his daughter is suing him for five billion 

531.82 533.99 B: oh brother 

532.68 535.36 A: so you know i mean 

536.14 538.11 B: oh that's pretty sad yeah i guess 

537.31 541.09 A: i'm just like you know what kick me back a million and i'll be fine 

541.49 549.42 A: you know but they do they care about their money and they have a lot to lose those people figure they can get money from them they'll go for it 

544.43 545.05 B: yeah 

549.00 551.65 B: yeah but you know you figure all the little people that 

552.14 555.32 B: that were effected by what she did and you know she 

555.99 559.75 B: you know the mom an- mom and pop investor or whoever you know that 

559.48 561.06 A: yeah 

559.92 563.87 B: isn't privy to that information suffers so much by that and 

564.22 566.58 B: you know she still would have made tons of money even if
