0.00 2.00 B: in philadelphia how 'bout you 

1.15 2.71 A: (( [lipsmack] hi )) 

2.99 9.21 B: syracuse near oh still pretty close i was wondering whether i'd get a west coast dinner for this call or not [laughter] 

3.39 4.53 A: i'm sue 

5.15 5.96 A: good 

6.76 9.24 A: okay i'm from syracuse new york 

10.17 11.25 B: okay 

11.76 20.98 B: ah yeah once a while ago it's pretty easy we just have to talk for ten minutes about the education question i guess did did you hear the prompt it was something about about computers in education 

13.02 16.28 A: no [laughter] um i've never done this before so 

16.54 17.83 A: have you done this before 

23.14 23.99 A: okay 

23.79 24.81 B: uh-huh 

24.51 25.41 A: yeah 

25.59 29.96 A: right and i'm ah a returning student getting my teaching degree right now a- 

27.14 28.04 B: okay 

30.33 33.34 A: as a older student i have teenagers at home 

33.53 40.30 A: so i don't know if that helps or hurts i don't know but wh- um what's your perspective on this 

33.60 48.25 B: well on computers in education i i guess on the one hand i think it's inevitable um so i've i'm kind of an ongoing student ah i guess i started to do undergraduate work in eighty one and i've done you know another degree and another degree and i um i also work at the university so 

48.27 57.99 B: um i've been around to see the change and at least in in higher education i don't know it's it's i think it said higher education anyway in higher education computers are just everywhere 

53.54 54.43 A: okay 

57.76 65.68 B: you know it used to be the case that ah you had to go to the lab to do your computing and ah i was i the library yesterday and i think just about everybody had a laptop 

63.31 64.87 A: right right 

65.70 79.50 B: you know plugged into the network you know in the library so everyone was doing internet while they were typing their papers and you know downloading music probably from the web and you know entertaining themselves simultaneously with working how 'bout you 

67.19 68.19 A: mhm 

70.64 72.35 A: (( mhm right )) 

74.13 75.14 A: mhm 

82.25 84.93 B: mhm 

83.69 84.57 A: right 

85.20 88.58 A: um i just think it it seems pretty important 

85.54 87.41 B: mhm 

88.67 91.78 A: um i don't think there's any way around it right now 

88.90 89.72 B: okay 

92.09 95.11 A: and i i see the same thing i have teenagers 

95.43 102.93 A: and i mean they use their computers for everything and i have students in first second third grade that i'm doing um student teaching with right now 

101.19 104.21 B: mhm 

102.94 106.99 A: and they even use the computers for um 

105.30 106.73 B: mhm 

107.18 113.76 A: just all kinds of stuff at school that you know especially with kids with disabilities it's just a huge help to them 

108.07 111.61 B: do you specialize on working with kids with disabilities yeah uh-huh 

115.68 116.63 A: yeah 

116.89 126.08 A: yeah so um it it's just it's such as big help 'cause there are all these other programs that automatically spell correct for them they do everything for them 

119.58 120.29 B: (( mm )) 

123.41 128.30 B: i'm curious what do you think is ah so useful about the ah ah 

126.57 129.28 A: so it really is a big help to them 

128.52 132.49 B: the computer for kids with disabilities why is it that it's more helpful than 

133.47 134.41 B: mhm 

136.72 143.28 A: well i think it hard for kids to even write some of 'em don't have any have very good even coordination 

137.13 138.85 B: mhm 

140.85 141.74 B: okay 

143.56 144.67 A: and 

144.70 146.75 A: the spelling really trips 'em up 

147.23 151.32 A: so if you've a got a computer that can spell or help with spelling or even do spell check 

147.65 149.37 B: right 

151.78 158.83 A: it just really helps them a lot so they don't caught up so much in trying to spell that limits them in what they wanna write creatively 

152.61 154.44 B: mhm 

159.00 165.03 A: so i think it really helps but you know i'm not a hundred percent on that but that's how it seems to me you know 

159.13 164.22 B: right when you talk about the coordination problems do you mean it hard for them to hold the pencil but it's easier to type 

164.85 165.75 B: okay 

165.21 166.17 A: so 

167.35 168.39 B: okay 

168.07 170.97 A: some of the kids yeah it's hard for them to hold the pencil 

170.73 171.83 B: right 

171.18 176.72 A: and i've even worked with kids with autism where it's just it's so necessary to have a computer 

175.22 176.85 B: right right 

176.80 179.11 A: of some kind because they can't write 

179.15 181.29 A: so it's their means of communicating 

182.12 195.02 A: but um just normal everyday average teenagers that i have i just i see them doing coming home and doing powerpoint presentations i mean things that are so far beyond what i ever could have done in high school because um 

182.55 183.56 B: mhm 

191.41 192.62 B: mhm 

195.95 204.83 A: it just wasn't available you know so i see them being much farther ahead professionally even when they get out of high school or college or whatever 

198.72 200.06 B: right right 

202.33 212.81 B: yeah certainly in the workplace you have to be able to do things like powerpoint presentations and spreadsheets and do documents on word so if if your children are learning how to do that already in school that's a great advantage 

205.16 208.35 A: just because of having that access to computers now 

212.46 213.46 A: mhm 

212.65 218.52 B: than having to learn it we have people ah where i work who you know didn't have all that that that level of experience 

213.90 214.78 A: right 

217.99 218.91 A: yeah 

218.56 225.67 B: and i sometimes forget like i'll sometimes tell some people d- do me a spreadsheet real quick that that that does the following and they'd be like i don't know how to use a spreadsheet 

225.55 235.38 B: [laughter] how do you do that and it's surprising because you know i'm i'm used to students that i see around me who are also um using spreadsheets all the time as though it's nothing 

230.74 231.98 A: [laughter] 

232.79 233.68 A: (( i know )) 

238.96 239.82 A: right 

240.43 243.71 A: right ah is this i just think that um 

243.95 258.31 B: right my wife works at a um nursery school she has four year olds in her class and the nursery school director has told them that they can't have a computer in the classroom because she thinks it's really important for four year olds to spend you know their whole time socializing 

245.05 249.92 A: computers are just becoming a necessity and i don't think there's any way around it 

254.62 255.53 A: uh-huh 

258.35 266.26 B: and she thinks that if they had computers they would you know just interact with the computer and not learn to socialize and i'm wondering what you think of that and 

263.36 264.38 A: (( mhm )) 

266.85 267.51 B: (( mm )) 

268.15 271.25 B: 'cause i'm not a teacher so i don't know but you have that perspective 

269.21 269.96 A: yeah 

271.03 273.42 A: that's that's an interesting point 

274.30 275.76 B: mhm 

275.13 278.04 A: yeah i think i think it's interesting because 

278.43 280.66 A: i can see why they would say that 

280.72 286.07 A: i don't know what your wife thinks but i can see how they're a big distraction for certain kids 

286.13 287.73 A: especially boys 

286.17 289.10 B: (( mhm )) 

288.03 300.52 A: some of the little boys with [laughter] attention deficit or whatever um they just it's it's a it's a real draw to them and they just get kind of stuck on it and they it it's hard for them to interact and those are the kids that really need interaction 

294.41 296.38 B: [mn] right right 

297.84 298.66 B: but it 

301.06 303.26 A: so i can see why they might say that 

303.53 312.95 A: but it would seem like it might be nice to have it for limited periods of time maybe you know a half hour a day or something where or it was like a reward kind of thing or you now just ah 

309.49 310.62 B: mhm 

312.97 313.86 A: maybe 

313.97 320.95 A: some time spent but you know not that it was available all day but that a certain amount of time it was available to the kids 

314.90 319.50 B: right right but you told me you're working with some kids who have p._d._d. so 

319.59 329.54 B: i guess the question is do you think that the school should sort of accommodate them by providing them with a computer which is you know helps them to write although it doesn't help their interactional skills 

321.53 322.45 A: i don't know 

329.34 337.59 B: or should kind of fight against their natural inclination and make them interact when when i think a p._d._d. kid doesn't want to often or is embarassed by trying to interact 

340.79 342.64 B: right 

341.97 346.81 A: i'm not sure that they're capable some of these kids aren't really capable of um communicating 

343.79 345.67 B: mhm 

347.53 349.91 A: and some of them can't really speak very well 

348.82 350.37 B: mhm 

350.18 359.62 A: but if they have some other means of communicating and they can use it and it works for them then yeah i think the school probably should provide it but i think most schools have it now you know 

352.92 354.76 B: mhm 

359.89 362.57 A: so i don't think it's a matter of whether they 

362.57 373.64 B: yeah i i guess i was asking the question of whether it's right to you know when you assess them you see a kid who has some kind of a socialization problem there's two things i think you could do you could say well this kid's having a problem socializing 

363.45 366.30 A: whether it's available or not i think it's just a matter of 

366.61 368.82 A: whether it's provided for them is that what you're saying 

373.51 385.44 B: so we'll provide the computer as a kind of companion or a helper to get the academic work done or you can go the opposite way and say no what this kid needs is to be sort of forced to socialize and so we're take the computer away 

374.92 376.61 A: right right 

379.08 379.68 A: (( right )) 

380.54 381.43 A: right 

383.77 385.06 A: yeah 

385.50 388.24 B: and it's a hard call very exactly 

388.45 390.04 A: right well 

390.90 397.46 A: that's a hard call you know it really probably depends on the kid's um disability and how extensive it is 

391.22 392.54 B: mhm 

397.63 398.73 A: um 

398.74 401.35 A: i i i see both sides of that but i think 

401.94 414.75 A: it it's hard to say but some kids are just so disabled that they really need it to do their work and in that case you know i think by all means provide it but it's it's a hard call it really is you know it really depends on each individual i think what do you think 

405.01 406.20 B: right 

408.87 413.99 B: [lipsmack] i think you're right i think it is a sort of individualistic thing um 

414.03 426.81 B: and ah i also guess that there's no one solution e- even though people will philosophically fall on one side or the other you know this idea that we have to fight ag- fight against you know f- force kids to do things that they don't do naturally i think can be overex- 

427.11 435.01 B: overextended you know so that the school becomes kind of antagonistic toward them if it's trying to get you know kids to socialize for example when that's 

432.41 433.38 A: mhm 

433.98 434.80 A: right 

434.92 448.92 B: you know their disability makes it makes it difficult for them and and that runs against their inclination i think what you need to do is not to create an environment where they're forced to do something but rather to find ways to encourage them or find ways to work around the disability 

436.94 437.87 A: mhm 

446.10 447.00 A: yeah 

449.42 455.95 B: so did you um have you been working with disabled kids all along or is this your new concentration since you've gone back to school 

452.91 453.86 A: mhm 

454.00 454.93 A: mhm 

459.20 460.24 B: uh-huh 

460.93 465.28 A: um it's sort of been since i've gone back to school but i have children with disabilities 

465.63 467.01 A: of my own so 

467.66 468.85 A: it's um 

468.88 473.68 A: kind of seemed like a natural thing and my husband decided to have mid life crisis and move out a few years ago so 

471.29 472.16 B: uh-huh 

473.08 475.30 B: (( so where are you are you at )) 

473.83 478.80 A: here i am back in school again i never thought i'd go back to school again but i'm getting my masters so 

476.11 477.01 B: uh-huh 

478.46 482.85 B: uh-huh and what university is this are you at syracuse yeah 

480.05 482.05 A: um i've got a year left 

482.31 484.55 A: and i'm just now starting my second year 

483.14 484.05 B: okay 

485.60 489.17 A: at syracuse university ah it's a reading language arts program 

489.57 496.88 A: and we actually h- are required to take computer classes we're required to take a like a computer in the classroom class 

490.62 492.34 B: mhm 

497.28 511.75 A: which i haven't taken yet but um and that's because they feel that that it is so critical that you're familiar with computers and what programs are available for children with disabilities and that sort of thing so i i think it's i think it's um 

503.09 504.20 B: right 

507.52 518.60 B: what do you think about the sort of diag- diagnos- diagnosis of disabilities um so you you say that you you have children with disabilities actually i have one also i have a daughter with disability um 

511.92 513.21 A: it's a pretty good thing 

519.23 524.65 B: (( ah she has ah um i'm going to forget what it's called now )) 

521.73 522.62 A: you do 

523.86 525.48 A: (( what kind of disability )) 

524.82 527.75 B: [laughter] ah auditory processing disorder 

527.96 532.22 B: um so she's very slow to pro- you probably know what it is actually she's very slow to pro- 

532.63 543.90 B: she has a difficult time processing things that she hears ah which makes it very difficult for her in a classroom because um you know the instructions are typically given verbally and she often doesn't understand what being told to her 

532.94 533.81 A: okay 

536.75 539.02 A: i don't know that much about it 

540.49 541.61 A: mhm 

543.10 544.13 A: right 

546.84 553.44 B: i think they're the best thing um she learned how to read for example from from computer games 

548.93 550.00 A: so you must 

550.18 553.52 A: have some kind of opinion on computers for somebody like that i mean 

553.37 559.19 B: um and in fact it was it was odd because she wasn't speaking very well when when she was very young but she was reading 

554.47 555.48 A: yeah 

556.74 557.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

558.85 559.72 A: yeah 

559.02 571.37 B: um quite quite ahead you know because [mn] it it that that matched her you know her we didn't try to fight her disability we didn't try to say to her no you must talk we let her kind of excel in areas that she was really good in 

566.98 567.86 A: uh-huh 

571.18 578.30 B: and we figured we'll just need to take more time to get her to speak and speak you know and and to understand that to to interact interact gracefully 

573.45 574.40 A: mhm 

578.35 583.66 B: but i also think that you know the diagnosis i i i guess i wouldn't say that a diagnosis is 

580.82 581.76 A: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

583.70 587.39 B: [mn] for a._d._d. i i think it is the case that we over diagnose 

587.62 599.95 B: um for other disabilities i don't think it's the case that we over diagnose but that we sort of created them um you know these are kids who under a less demanding school situation would not have a disability in some sense bec- 

592.20 593.65 A: [noise] [noise] right 

597.90 598.98 A: mhm
