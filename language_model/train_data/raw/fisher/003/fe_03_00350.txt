24.00 25.23 A: (( so you )) 

24.10 24.90 B: (( [mn] )) 

24.95 29.06 B: if you could open up your business and money was no object what would you open up 

29.92 35.68 A: know i probably would open up a a bakery or some such type of 

35.40 36.24 B: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

36.42 37.38 A: um 

37.76 40.62 A: i like to cook like to make cookies 

38.76 39.68 B: uh-huh 

41.56 42.43 B: cool 

42.08 43.59 A: i'm told that i can 

43.81 46.57 A: make them edible so [laughter] 

46.29 58.15 B: that would be good that sounds great i've often thought about opening up a restaurant i cook but i don't think i would be the cook per se if you were going to open up the cookie place or the bakery would you do the cooking 

54.14 54.83 A: (( mm )) 

57.89 59.76 A: yeah i'd probably do the cooking 

59.32 60.13 B: uh-huh 

60.39 61.76 A: oh it um 

61.79 63.52 A: so i'd have to have a manager 

63.30 64.16 B: uh-huh 

64.17 65.39 A: (( because i'm )) 

66.31 68.63 B: have you ever thought a- go ahead 

66.56 68.03 A: i don't hmm 

68.43 70.03 A: no what [laughter] 

69.68 71.86 B: have you ever thought about doing it for real 

72.82 74.19 A: (( well )) 

74.91 78.48 A: not really because i enjoy what i'm doing it actually so 

77.72 78.63 B: uh-huh 

78.82 81.23 A: and i kind of work for myself 

81.60 82.83 B: as it is 

82.28 83.86 A: yeah as it is so 

83.57 84.45 B: uh-huh 

83.95 85.60 A: (( it's um mm )) 

85.01 86.68 B: yeah i actually um 

86.96 91.16 B: if i were to open up a business i've often thought about opening like up a bookstore 

91.03 91.87 A: (( hmm )) 

91.21 93.68 B: because i love books i used to be a teacher 

93.84 97.16 B: um so like a children's bookstore would be nice but 

96.35 97.46 A: oh that would be neat 

97.75 101.96 B: i've got to say my husband has his own business and it's hard 

102.24 104.00 A: yeah um 

102.83 104.58 B: [laughter] 

104.56 111.15 A: that's that's probably the reason why i haven't thought of actually going ahead and doing that 

110.73 111.57 B: right 

111.37 115.06 A: now that my kids are out of the house so it's probably 

115.42 116.39 A: um 

117.23 119.96 A: more of a possibility than it would have been 

119.46 120.37 B: uh-huh 

120.11 121.75 A: previously so 

121.97 127.80 B: right it does sound i mean it does seem appealing i would love to be able to be set my own hours like my husband can uh 

127.94 128.86 A: uh-huh 

128.08 138.53 B: leave work when he wants to and go on vacation for the most part you know when he wants to and that's very appealing to me but the the finan- i mean i guess they said money was no object 

138.70 140.32 B: so maybe that's what their 

138.75 143.81 A: that would still worry me [laughter] that would still worry me [laughter] 

140.40 141.54 B: (( what )) 

142.38 144.84 B: [laughter] 

143.86 147.22 A: yeah for right now it would be no object but in 

146.24 150.37 B: (( right well that's the hypothetical situation part apparently )) 

150.01 151.10 A: (( right that )) 

150.54 161.90 B: um so i mean if that was the case yes i think i would open up a bookstore and i would like try and get children's authors into the bookstore and do little book discussions with kids and stuff and i think that would be fun i 

161.99 166.60 B: i'd love to have food in there at some point too though like [laughter] 

162.14 163.10 A: would be neat 

165.61 169.86 A: oh we could work together i could make you a little a little um 

167.00 168.17 B: there you go 

170.95 172.67 A: (( a little f- ah )) 

173.69 176.35 A: (( not not- hors d'oeuvres what am i )) 

176.67 179.01 A: like not tea biscuits but 

179.25 182.22 A: you know little itty bitty cookies that you can 

181.19 182.07 B: sure 

182.29 185.63 A: sit and munch on while you're looking at different books 

184.26 191.68 B: see you know that would be cool actually i that seems like a good business i like the combination of reading and food i think it's a good one 

191.63 193.85 A: there's this really neat coffee shop 

194.23 197.16 A: down downtown hartford where i live here 

196.69 197.54 B: uh-huh 

197.18 198.66 A: and they um 

199.78 202.33 A: have made it very very homey 

202.57 203.91 A: and ah 

204.13 205.16 A: you can 

205.53 208.14 A: eat at a table or you can 

208.57 214.03 A: sit down at a couch and put your feet up on an ottoman or you can um 

211.54 212.51 B: uh-huh 

214.74 215.62 A: ah 

216.38 222.78 A: sit and have long conversations with your friends and they don't have a time limit 

222.23 227.56 B: that's nice so it's is it a bookstore too or just a coffee shop or thing or 

223.25 224.21 A: so 

226.21 227.27 A: um 

227.71 232.14 A: it's basically i don't no they don't have a um 

232.47 234.01 A: a bookstore 

234.21 236.20 A: in that area no 

235.22 236.22 B: (( mhm )) 

236.23 239.61 A: um we just got a brand new ah 

239.78 241.46 A: oh used to have a a 

241.57 246.28 A: used bookstore but they just were called the painted lady and that one just went out of business or 

245.99 246.96 B: (( mm )) 

246.31 248.45 A: moved or something i'm not sure 

247.10 248.20 B: (( mhm )) 

248.48 250.15 A: exactly why i know it's 

250.32 253.15 A: got another little haberdashery type of 

253.96 255.36 A: thing going in 

255.08 256.89 B: how many people live in your town 

257.00 260.38 A: um between nine and ten thousand so 

259.76 260.72 B: okay 

261.21 264.20 B: so you would know when businesses come and go i would imagine 

263.43 269.40 A: it yeah the they have a pretty good little weekly newspaper that keeps everybody 

268.28 269.22 B: uh-huh 

269.51 271.10 A: (( tap [laughter] )) 

270.78 280.27 B: see now that's the kind of size community that i think um it would be fun to have your own business in because you'd know everybody that came in you know 

279.95 280.91 A: mhm 

280.54 289.74 B: and you would have your regulars everyday that would come in for your cookies or whatever like i don't know that seems very appealing to me like in chicago it's a very anonymous sort of place and 

289.80 293.05 B: i'm sure after a while you do get your regulars but 

293.09 296.65 A: yeah and i think it's it's almost as hard 

296.79 301.09 A: in this kind of an area it might seem like it'd be easier 

300.69 301.77 B: right 

301.14 307.52 A: but it's very um at least this this little portion of wisconsin's very um 

308.41 311.31 A: (( oh i don't know what not insular )) 

311.34 313.47 A: but kind of like um 

314.44 315.70 A: provincial 

315.36 316.25 B: uh-huh 

315.86 317.27 A: and they 

317.33 321.42 A: you remain an outsider for a very long time [laughter] 

320.82 323.75 B: is that right are you are you from the town 

323.16 327.61 A: no i'm not [laughter] so um 

324.26 325.61 B: (( ah mhm )) 

328.33 338.85 A: knowing ah knowing people is one thing and and you if you have if you have a reputation it's a lot easier to 

338.91 344.40 A: um if you've gone to school here and and if you've you know are one of the 

341.18 342.20 B: right 

344.47 349.53 A: upper families or the families that were here forever and ah 

345.53 347.17 B: [laughter] 

349.84 350.89 A: um 

350.92 355.31 A: there was ah even my kids we they grew up here most of them 

355.00 355.89 B: uh-huh 

355.32 356.40 A: um 

356.52 358.61 A: ah started out here 

358.65 360.04 A: (( but ah )) 

360.25 362.93 A: um they the one that 

362.95 365.89 A: the even my daughter who actually 

365.94 368.02 A: was born here oh not born here 

368.34 370.49 A: went through the whole school system here 

369.91 371.25 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

370.52 371.69 A: um 

372.16 380.95 A: still had ah a hard time actually fitting in because we had a different kind of lifestyle or 

381.15 382.03 A: um 

382.29 386.94 A: i don't know business ethic work ethic whatever than a than a lot of the 

384.69 386.26 B: that's really interesting 

387.02 388.69 A: (( natives had )) 

388.34 390.00 B: that's really interesting 

388.78 389.56 A: so 

389.67 393.00 A: yeah so if it was just different and 

392.41 395.22 B: so if your kids grew up there you've been there a long time 

394.82 399.06 A: yeah well yeah about thirteen fourteen years now 

398.75 401.60 B: so you and you still feel that that's fascinating 

401.18 414.68 A: yeah it i- it's it but that's a small town for you [laughter] so and even my mom she was in a ah even a smaller community in michigan and um 

405.23 406.30 B: right 

412.02 412.93 B: uh-huh 

415.50 417.70 A: they've lived there she's lived there 

417.92 421.44 A: oh probably close to forty years now 

421.58 435.92 A: and she's still not really looked upon as being a native of the town [laughter] she's seventy five it's like how many times are you going to move mom [laughter] um 

426.52 428.25 B: isn't that something 

429.68 431.52 B: that is just crazy 

432.74 434.89 B: [laughter] 

435.84 447.30 A: but my brothers feel like it's home because they they bas- they did grow up there and so um my my brother's on the school board that kind of thing so he was able to make a 

437.81 438.76 B: uh-huh 

440.58 441.57 B: uh-huh 

445.20 446.24 B: (( got ya )) 

447.56 454.09 A: a success and be become a part of you know the the landscape i guess 

453.18 454.65 B: (( mhm )) 

454.33 460.85 A: um and i think that's a real big plus when you're looking to be successful in just about anything 

460.38 465.89 B: absolutely definitely well that is really interesting do you think you'll ever feel like you're 

462.24 463.05 A: um 

466.69 468.81 B: you know part of the c- well 

468.77 480.15 A: yeah i think so eventually i at this point it's not that big of an issue any more you know it's i think it was more of an issue for my kids to feel like they were 

470.28 471.75 B: [laughter] 

474.39 475.23 B: (( uh-huh )) 

480.16 489.20 A: a part of a community that na- it's not like they were always they were ostracized or anything it was just that they had a different attitude towards things and 

481.87 482.93 B: yeah 

485.56 486.81 B: right 

489.29 493.73 A: and um and they noticed it [laughter] 

492.54 494.14 B: where did you move from 

494.04 501.98 A: we moved um well actually we moved around a lot and so they had a pretty cosmopolitan 

497.45 498.35 B: uh-huh 

502.18 503.16 A: um 

503.93 505.18 A: outlook on 

505.22 514.34 A: life and pretty much were were acceptable of just about anything that could happen because they'd seen just about anything 

505.66 506.53 B: uh-huh 

511.35 512.30 B: (( mhm )) 

513.95 515.05 B: right 

514.47 515.91 A: and um 

516.45 517.38 A: (( ah )) 

517.59 519.15 A: it was um 

519.25 524.05 A: they they couldn't understand sometimes the um 

524.76 526.04 A: (( the )) 

527.45 532.04 A: the i i don't know parochialism or the you know the um 

532.33 535.33 A: isolationism almost that some you know 

534.08 534.97 B: (( yeah )) 

535.39 546.11 A: what do you mean you've never driven to milwaukee you know it's only [laughter] twenty minutes away oh well we can't go there because that's the big city [laughter] 

538.64 540.22 B: isn't that something 

544.25 548.17 B: isn't that something that is really i have found that to be 

548.23 554.87 B: i it's always amazing to me that there are people that have never left like their tiny little pocket of the world 

554.48 555.72 A: mhm 

555.08 556.24 B: like um 

557.12 560.27 B: ah people on the east coast that have never been 

560.36 565.36 B: to the mid west they don't even unders- they don't understand it as a concept you know what i mean 

564.18 566.16 A: yeah [laughter] 

565.53 573.87 B: like wait a minute where is that now it's it's bizarre to me that there are people like that and then a um friend of mine's husband has never been 

567.74 568.84 A: mhm 

569.19 570.16 A: yeah 

574.74 587.84 B: east of chicago [laughter] which is you know i mean there's a whole big country out a huge country out there that is fascinating to me and i think i mean your kids definitely have the advantage as they've been around 

576.51 577.87 A: [laughter] wow 

580.57 581.76 A: mhm 

582.18 583.03 A: yeah

593.43 595.94 A: two of the older thr- um 

597.74 606.77 A: not the oldest the oldest's still pretty much a pretty good home girl but anyway [laughter] she she needs to her mommy but um 

601.88 603.06 B: (( mhm )) 

604.90 606.87 B: [laughter] 

607.10 609.14 A: the the next two 

609.15 620.81 A: in line both joined the army just to basically get out of this place [laughter] so they could have a relationship with people that knew something other than 

611.29 612.70 B: oh wow 

614.34 615.35 B: uh-huh 

620.36 622.27 B: wow uh-huh [mn]

627.88 632.96 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

631.36 633.83 A: oh it's a little drastic but 

632.99 635.88 B: [laughter] are they still in the army 

634.24 635.12 A: (( i don't know )) 

635.60 648.01 A: no [laughter] lucky for them they were able to get [laughter] to just do their time and and um oh my one of my sons is still in the in the reserves but

655.83 657.21 B: that's amazing 

658.39 660.67 B: because like you can't be that old i mean 

660.43 666.53 A: well no but we started you know you start early and and you'll end up with them 

664.33 665.34 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

666.84 672.07 A: leaving early [laughter] that's been kind of nice that way but um 

668.17 670.01 B: [laughter] 

670.83 675.12 B: that's the opposite i'm old and i have a fifteen month old 

674.78 677.89 A: (( oh wow that's so cute )) 

675.72 681.28 B: i mean i'm not i'm but i'm on the old side i would imagine of parenthood thirty six

682.72 683.97 A: that's okay 

683.99 684.80 A: (( i mean )) 

684.19 695.68 B: that's so yeah so we have the opposite thing where it's like wow i mean we tried to do all all our living before and now we're looking at being insanely old parents at our kids' high school graduation instead 

690.26 691.35 A: mhm 

693.29 699.02 A: oh right [laughter] i don't know about insanely old but 

696.26 697.07 B: (( [mn] )) 

697.68 707.13 B: you know what i mean like it's it's really interesting i have a friend who's not much older than me whose kids are grown and so she's done [laughter] it's just a whole different thing 

704.98 706.74 A: (( mhm well ah )) 

706.87 714.67 A: it's it's a whole different um i know i have a ah a girlfriend who's who actually lives in woodridge um 

713.41 714.39 B: (( mhm )) 

715.10 719.89 A: and she basically started having kids a- i mean like
