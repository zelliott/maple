91.10 91.65 A: dog 

92.63 94.20 B: do you like i like dogs because they are like 

94.41 100.20 B: very faithful and they're nice and they're going to like need your attention and love and stuff like that

103.28 103.86 B: right 

103.35 103.66 A: they 

103.84 108.85 A: they their there sometimes they're there for you they have a personality and cats i think are just 

109.08 109.61 A: kind of 

109.64 110.95 B: selfish 

110.43 111.30 A: yeah 

111.06 122.02 B: yeah because i had a friend who had a cat and every time she wanted to sit on the like if the cat want to sit on the couch and if she sat on the cat i mean the couch the cat would get really mad 

117.02 117.68 A: yeah 

122.24 123.18 A: yeah 

122.82 125.98 B: so she couldn't sit on the couch you know what i mean 

126.09 126.99 B: that's just funny 

127.08 128.81 A: yeah and the dogs are just 

129.06 131.43 A: i mean they know when you're coming home and 

130.61 131.96 B: i know they're very sweet 

132.15 133.05 A: yeah 

133.54 134.59 B: but i guess it's just 

134.84 136.64 B: i don't like it you know when pet 

137.25 138.96 B: you know they lick you or 

138.62 139.43 A: yeah 

139.48 148.04 B: i hate that that's another reason why i never want to have pet because i could never stand it like licking my face or you know any part of me that's just 

148.29 150.09 B: i'm like no that's not for me 

149.24 150.25 A: yeah 

150.60 151.17 A: yeah 

150.76 152.74 B: but i still like dogs they're sweet 

153.14 155.39 A: yeah definitely the only problem is 

155.50 158.64 A: taking care it's it's like having a child i guess is 

158.25 159.43 B: really yeah you do 

158.95 159.44 A: you 

160.50 164.89 A: you can't you know you always have to come back home you have to walk them you have to 

164.39 168.91 B: yeah feed them and take them out for walks and you know it's just it's 

165.08 166.38 A: feed them 

166.74 167.17 A: yeah 

169.08 171.96 B: i because one of my friends she's just taking care of a dog 

172.31 175.92 B: like her her friend's out so she's taking care of her friends dog 

176.47 181.54 B: and she's like it's so painful because you know i need there are times i have to take him out 

181.12 181.73 A: yeah 

181.72 185.64 B: you know i have to like be careful and then she's like my whole house start smelling 

186.29 186.64 B: because 

186.94 194.88 B: she doesn't have time to give him a bath like you know and she gives him a bath like once a week or something but she's like he just starts stinking so badly 

195.06 195.97 A: it's yeah 

195.70 199.26 B: (( )) and that's another reason i hate it when pets stink 

199.64 203.04 A: right it's that in dogs it becomes very easy 

203.15 204.38 B: yeah for them to stink 

204.23 204.85 A: yeah 

205.12 207.56 B: and then i also i guess it's also because of fleas 

207.95 208.51 A: yeah 

208.79 212.62 B: crazy like over here like atlanta it's so summer-y and hot in the summer 

212.29 213.21 A: yeah 

225.85 229.56 A: it's and then you have the dog hair everywhere 

233.83 234.23 A: yeah 

234.52 235.19 B: especially (( )) 

235.35 235.63 B: flying 

238.23 239.23 B: irritating you know 

239.50 240.08 A: yeah

263.62 264.08 B: really 

264.09 265.00 A: yeah 

264.50 265.61 B: well that's nice 

265.80 271.98 B: but this this topic of discussion is pretty to talk about yesterday they had they had something about you know 

268.85 269.86 A: yeah 

272.34 274.58 B: students going on strikes or like sport 

274.75 275.25 A: oh 

275.19 276.57 B: you know stuff like that and i'm like 

275.82 279.55 A: yeah actually i wasn't here like um two days ago an i got a message there was like 

279.72 282.00 A: sports on t._v. or something like that 

281.76 282.53 B: yeah

285.14 287.62 A: yeah yes yeah 

287.43 292.66 B: and then when i get back i have like these thirty messages on my answering machine i'm like oh my god 

293.41 294.47 B: so it's pretty crazy 

294.39 297.65 A: yeah i think that the computer just keeps calling and calling and calling and 

297.33 301.02 B: yeah but (( )) i mean it's okay and all 

301.16 301.96 A: yeah 

301.85 305.64 B: so so what do you do beside i mean your studying speech you said right 

304.72 309.41 A: yeah actually i study speech um speech perception and the reason why i got 

308.42 310.14 B: uh-huh this should help you 

309.95 312.13 A: yeah and the reason i think of it i i'm 

312.40 316.07 A: the university of pennsylvania has this um pretty interesting web site 

316.18 317.33 A: it's called a language 

317.51 318.65 A: something consortium 

318.67 319.24 B: okay 

319.18 325.71 A: and i think that i had signed up just go get e. updates of emails on on things and that's how i got information on this study 

325.74 326.22 B: okay 

326.18 328.47 A: just wanted people and of course i forwarded this web site 

328.64 332.15 A: the message to all my friends but a lot of 

332.79 337.31 A: um people who study they create um databases of conversations 

337.52 338.27 A: um 

338.45 338.88 A: and 

339.09 341.63 A: things like that from which then they'll do um 

341.30 343.89 B: so so what do you arrive once you've studied this 

344.08 344.67 A: i'm sorry 

344.69 346.76 B: i mean once when you're studying speech what do you 

347.19 351.85 B: really derive from the whole conversation do you all derive the accents or 

351.45 354.18 A: probably i mean i'm not sure but i don't my 

354.43 355.26 A: particular 

355.36 356.89 A: area of research we don't 

357.07 360.43 A: um use these databases we don't use this type of information 

360.30 360.78 B: okay 

373.07 373.69 B: okay 

373.28 377.41 A: so i'll try to get a nice database of very natural speech 

377.97 378.39 A: um 

378.89 386.05 A: in my in my lab we do we have recordings so we have people come in a booth and record things but its kind of artificial in a sense 

386.20 387.97 B: yeah because it's just not natural 

386.25 387.11 A: no 

387.58 387.92 A: so 

388.36 390.31 A: couldn't be the (( )) like this it's more 

390.56 392.83 A: um reflex more of the everyday 

392.83 399.32 B: that's yeah that's (( )) pretty impressive thing actually when i received the email it's like well that sounds you know pretty interesting 

399.56 400.47 A: yeah 

400.91 402.46 A: so i'm actually i'm 

402.60 405.49 A: starting on my dissertation right now and i'm focusing in on 

405.65 408.85 A: um english that's spoken with a foreign accent 

408.19 410.77 B: oh do you do do you find do you find that i have an accent 

408.97 409.84 A: yeah 

410.61 413.25 A: um at the beginning yeah i i 

413.50 416.32 A: i heard something and then when you said you're from india 

416.05 416.48 B: yeah 

416.92 417.60 A: yeah 

417.54 418.75 B: yeah i i mean yeah 

419.05 426.14 B: it it's i guess it's like if you go to a new accent then everybody is like you have an accent if you ever come to india they'd be like okay you have an accent 

425.66 426.23 A: yeah 

426.26 428.10 B: so it's pretty much the same 

428.44 429.44 A: but you know it's so funny 

429.61 433.10 A: um but your english how have you long have you lived in in atlanta 

433.16 434.22 B: on to six months 

434.36 435.00 A: oh okay 

435.55 438.74 A: are you do you think you'll pick up the southern accent 

438.29 444.85 B: oh do you think i have a southern accent no no i haven't picked up the southern accent it's actually like in india we have a 

439.33 441.48 A: no i don't at all not at all 

445.34 448.04 B: we follow everything um the way we write and the way we 

448.15 449.19 B: speak is it is 

449.39 454.80 B: um our it's pretty much british so um most of my friends they have such a 

449.85 450.43 A: british 

451.70 452.08 A: yeah 

454.99 463.00 B: flat accent and we don't really speak that flat as how the british would actually speak but the way we write and our grammar and our spellings 

463.71 465.87 B: it's just the way the english would spell it 

465.91 466.31 A: yeah 

466.57 466.88 B: so it's 

467.04 468.72 B: it's pretty much like that 

469.56 469.88 B: but 

470.17 472.70 A: so it my my best friend is from cashmir 

472.82 473.61 B: oh really 

473.47 475.32 A: and then i had um i lived with 

475.80 477.25 A: a roommate who was also 

477.59 478.58 A: also from half 

478.82 479.79 A: indian half 

480.01 480.55 A: um 

481.64 482.46 A: kenyan 

482.99 488.05 A: and so i reco- that's why the accent sounded very familiar to me 

486.70 487.70 B: okay 

488.26 489.19 B: yeah 

489.69 493.34 B: but yes so so are you doing your undergrad or are you doing your grad program 

492.99 495.09 A: i'm doing a p._h._d. yeah 

494.44 495.76 B: oh my god 

495.92 498.31 B: that's long p._h._d.'s are difficult 

498.13 500.44 A: it's i'm in a and i'm actually at the 

501.10 504.49 A: yeah i'm trying right now i'm going to be working on 

505.10 508.63 A: be writing my proposal it's a lot of work 

509.71 512.25 A: i feel like i've been a student for ever 

513.16 519.56 B: so yeah you know that must be crazy i mean i can i think you need so much just like will and determination to do a p._h._d. 

519.61 520.59 A: yeah
