12.28 14.39 B: yeah um 

14.44 18.42 B: would do you have any opinions on the the topic 

19.20 21.96 A: just trust and honesty [noise] [laughter] 

21.48 23.07 B: just trust and honesty 

23.68 28.10 B: um yeah i i think those are important too i think compatibility is important though 

27.41 28.17 A: [noise] 

28.88 34.53 B: too i- in the long run i mean if you're if you want to be with someone theoretically for the rest of your life you you 

34.69 39.52 B: have to make sure there's [mn] there's some enough things in common that will keep you 

39.82 41.33 B: together you know 

41.47 46.42 A: [noise] yeah yeah having interests that both that also helps [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

46.51 48.68 B: yeah yeah yeah 

49.13 53.41 B: hm but by having th- the like you say the trust and the honesty those are 

53.45 56.44 B: those are essential because um 

56.92 58.75 B: you know without those then 

59.25 61.41 B: there's really no reason to stay together 

61.76 65.40 A: [noise] you really wouldn't have anything [laughter] 

63.79 66.09 B: no no that's true that's true 

65.75 71.55 A: i know i've been married for ten years and honesty is the one of the big things [noise] 

70.99 71.84 B: mhm 

73.48 76.17 B: um [mn] have you found that um 

76.67 82.98 B: [mn] with your friends because i've never been married i'm i'm thirty one years old but i've never been married um 

83.27 87.49 B: have you found that with your your single friends that um 

88.36 93.89 B: finding someone that they feel that they can be find trustworthy and honest has been a problem 

94.21 97.03 A: well with today's uh because i'm only 

97.13 99.27 A: twenty six i mean i mean with today's 

100.59 104.02 A: i don't know outlook on life there's a lot of 

104.44 109.43 A: i- it's hard to find the honest ones you know like you see twenty year olds we have a 

107.08 108.16 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

109.49 115.98 A: a couple that they just absolutely were not getting along because of you know lying and 

115.70 117.01 B: (( mhm )) 

116.92 119.86 A: i don't know it's they find it hard 

120.20 129.55 A: to settle down but they're only in their twenties too i don't think a person some people don't start settling down 'til a lot of the times they hit their forties 

128.93 130.68 B: yeah 

130.81 132.13 B: yeah 

131.74 133.28 A: so i think the younger 

133.50 135.70 A: you are the harder [laughter] 

135.99 138.67 A: because you're not really ready to make that commitment 

139.29 143.26 B: [lipsmack] yeah i think that's true especially in in our society because 

143.32 151.06 B: er we live in such a a diverse society and m- maybe you know a hundred years ago when most people had pretty much the same 

151.07 155.10 B: values and outlooks on life it it was easier if you settled down when you were 

155.34 157.73 B: you know twenty one or twenty two 

157.45 158.38 A: (( mhm )) 

158.01 167.15 B: and you know you would kind of know what to expect for the r- the next forty or fifty years of being together but that's not so much the case nowadays because people are 

167.35 176.90 B: um people usually both partners are working and you know they they both have their own sets of ah expectations in life for themselves as well as for their partner 

177.11 184.73 B: and as well as the the honesty part there's so many i guess there's there's always been temptation you know like to cheat or 

184.95 190.84 B: or whatever but today uh it just seems there's a whole lot more i- 

191.18 194.34 B: it's just i think it would be it's harder today 

194.44 195.70 B: in a lot of ways 

196.59 198.34 A: [noise] [noise] oh that's very true 

198.58 209.64 A: that and now- nowadays um back then your parents picked your other half if you think about it and and nowadays it's a lot of kids do the opposite 

203.93 204.76 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

209.24 210.64 B: right 

210.09 214.41 A: well you know i really like this one well that's okay i'm not staying with that one [sigh] 

214.08 216.92 B: mhm yeah that's true 

217.44 223.95 B: i i don't think a lot of families really even take the initiative to to let their kids know 

223.96 231.09 B: nowadays if they dislike their partner or they they might let them know but they'll kind of stand back and they won't really um 

231.18 232.71 A: voice their opinions 

231.91 239.77 B: yeah th- they won't voice their opinions as strongly as they could have or as you know like may- maybe fifty years ago if you were planning to to marry or or 

239.93 247.15 B: ah enter into a relationship with someone that your your family really didn't like then they would go all out to make sure you didn't settle down with that person 

246.03 250.21 A: [laughter] [noise] person may disappear [laughter] 

249.36 253.31 B: yeah yeah yeah but i i don't think people do that as much anymore 

254.03 255.95 A: i know i got three em 

254.08 254.84 B: so 

256.25 260.89 A: i mean absolutely if i did not like somebody i i think i would stand up and say something 

260.64 261.51 B: mhm 

260.90 262.79 A: only for say 

262.91 266.14 A: you're gonna have the kid move out they'll gonna be right back at home 

265.87 267.28 B: right right 

266.19 268.43 A: and they need to stand on their own two feet 

268.18 271.42 B: mhm mhm that's true that's true 

272.16 275.01 B: so ah you said you had been the relationship for ten years 

274.42 277.59 A: mhm on september second it will be ten years

287.13 288.79 B: a lot of people 

289.50 295.67 B: [mn] have you found that there are any special pressures that you face just because you got married at such a young age 

295.39 296.30 A: nope 

296.18 298.12 B: (( no no okay )) 

297.35 300.37 A: but i'm a very headstrong person too so

307.85 310.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

310.98 315.79 B: ah talked out a lot of your issues before hand before you actually made the decision to get married and 

311.28 320.21 A: mhm [noise] [noise] well in our situation we both had to grow up kind of quick 

319.91 321.07 B: mhm 

320.47 326.99 A: and i don't know from fifteen to eighteen you really can't talk out too many issues 

326.60 327.62 B: right

328.28 335.39 A: up and down the little ladder of oh that seven year itch is going to come they're not going to be together well we're still together [laughter] 

334.62 336.52 B: mhm mhm 

335.88 343.22 A: so you know we grew up and did our thing and when eighteen rolled around we had already had two kids that we were 

344.15 345.98 A: so we just kind of stayed together 

345.91 346.82 B: okay 

347.51 353.08 A: we both made the decision if i absolutely can't stand you i'm not going to marry you just because i have a kid [mn] well it sounds like 

355.04 366.20 B: all right mhm [noise] compared to a lot of people i- i'm not sure a lot of people ah that young could be that mature about it but 

358.17 359.28 A: (( you you kinda knew what you were )) 

366.46 368.53 B: it sounds like you were 

368.70 372.63 A: doing [laughter] [laughter] [noise] well i can't get along with people my own age now so [laughter] 

371.99 373.50 B: (( oh okay ))

378.92 380.21 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

381.80 389.03 B: so do you find that did you find that some of your friends maybe [mn] kind of drifted off after you got married because maybe they couldn't handle 

389.42 392.98 B: ah the issues that you were having to deal with as a married person 

393.09 405.78 A: actually no we still have a l- you know all the friends that we had even through high school and i- it's just that you know we'll party or something like i still can't believe you guys are together [laughter] it's like well huh

407.99 409.36 B: (( mhm mhm ))

414.76 416.22 B: mhm

513.68 524.37 B: um even though her and her and her ah children's father are not together anymore but i i still have noticed a a really significant change in her i think she's a lot more responsible than she was before
