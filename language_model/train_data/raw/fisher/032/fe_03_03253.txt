181.19 182.54 B: yeh yeh 

183.10 196.93 B: 'cause ah let me see now i guess i've been seeing my girl for about six months and like we get along really well i mean we don't kind of we don't really grate on each other's i mean we're we get along pretty well i know it's kind of early to ah make decisions but ah i'm thinking of moving in with her 

196.98 203.09 B: um you know as soon as i'm basically able to get a job closer to her i live outside i live in jersey right now she lives in new york city so 

202.89 204.00 A: [noise] wow

210.19 212.27 A: (( [noise] oh that's cool )) 

211.81 216.20 B: yeah so probably like you know three and a half four days out of the week i'm over there 

216.20 227.04 B: and this has been going on for like now at least four months and it's it's been good i'm just kind of you know as this kind of time i'm kind of wary about what might go wrong and and you know what the stumbling points are in 

227.28 228.54 B: in relationships 

228.83 231.39 A: [noise] [noise] i don't know do you hang out with your friends a lot

231.17 234.86 B: um yeah i mean i guess uh my friends are a little bit you know i 

235.03 242.89 B: i moved here because i wanted to be closer to them and like we i used to live with them i mean i used to you know be their roommates and stuff and then i had to move out here 

243.07 248.64 B: so just the fact that i live outside the city is kind of hard for me to be as cl- you know to visit as much as possible 

248.90 260.22 B: but i try i mean i try to see them you know a couple of times a month um and then we have you know we always have you know parties at at friend's places so we always you know hang out hang out when we're there but ah you know their i think their lifestyles are a little bit different than mine

272.57 274.38 A: yeah 

272.76 279.47 B: i'm not you know we have less like i don't really like going out and just blowing you know fifty bucks hundred bucks a night on just you know going to the bars

343.21 352.07 B: yeah yeah no but but i hear you man if she she like whenever i say like i need to go out and see my friends she's like all right you know i know i wish you'd stay here but at the same time i'm not going to give you grief because i understand 

351.50 361.19 A: yeah it'll be different when you move in [laughter] it'll be different because girls girls get attached to guys they 

352.21 354.23 B: but i can see where if she was kind of saying 

355.36 358.23 B: yeah yeah that that's what i'm kinda worried about you know i mean i yeah

388.73 389.63 B: yeah 

393.14 394.88 B: yeah yeah 

400.37 410.29 B: yeah no usually usually if like it's like it's like we we talk about stuff and we really were open so if if we have problems like i'm like i i want to go out with my friends you know do you do you have anything in mind 

410.33 422.11 B: and if there's a problem she'll she'll come out and say it but but usually i like to get that stuff out in the open before you know like i can do anything because i don't want to come back and be like oh you know and have to like pick up and deal with the baggage afterward 

421.74 423.57 A: yeah 

423.00 426.34 B: but um but i mean you're happy with her i mean you're you're pretty

436.50 444.80 A: yeah i i deal with it i mean if i don't know it's kind of exciting our relationship because she's an aquarius and i'm a scorpio and we're like 

436.64 437.63 B: (( happy with her )) 

444.77 446.59 A: completely opposite 

446.24 447.12 B: yeah

454.40 455.26 B: yeah 

456.71 457.57 B: yeah 

456.73 468.72 A: because we have so much things we can find out about each other and do things together and always have something to talk about because we we don't like anything that each other likes so we're never we're d- we're never 

461.74 462.49 B: it's 

466.05 467.64 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

468.92 471.52 A: free of a conversation we can always talk

489.08 503.83 B: yeah that's pretty much how it is with us right now i mean like we we really get along you know we get along at a deeper level than i think that [mn] our other friends but i mean it's just we also go out and we make i make it up to see her friends and she has come out with me to see my friends and stuff like that so 

504.39 510.87 B: you know it's just that we spend all of our you know a lot of our free time with each other as opposed to just trying to schedule stuff
