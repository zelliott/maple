48.53 53.80 B: so how did you look for i guess we're supposed to talk about how we look for a life partner maybe 

53.31 54.49 A: um 

54.52 60.24 A: the qualities that you look for that you looked for i must say trustworthiness definitely

60.86 61.89 A: uh 

62.56 65.68 B: if they if you can't trust 'em you just wouldn't need 'em 

65.57 66.56 A: [laughter] 

67.17 69.24 A: exactly intelligence 

69.55 72.45 A: if you can't carry on a conversation with 'em 

73.38 79.79 B: yeah looks don't count for a whole lot and you can't always tell if they're gonna be rich or not [laughter] 

78.69 84.27 A: no because what you start off with is always what you get at the end [laughter] 

83.00 86.62 B: that's right [laughter] we can't judge a book by its cover [laughter] 

85.26 86.28 A: no

92.84 94.29 A: [laughter] 

93.93 98.07 B: all that good stuff which doesn't really matter much in the long run either 

98.67 101.08 B: we want somebody that's good to our children and 

101.46 104.11 B: um like you said honest and 

104.15 109.11 B: moral and all that stuff a lot more important than some things 

108.97 114.55 A: i think one of the first things i noticed about my husband was that he was good with my friends' kids 

114.33 116.65 B: yeah so that gave you a clue 

116.27 122.23 A: exactly that he'd be a good father one of these day one of those days at that point [laughter] [noise] 

119.94 127.70 B: yeah yeah well i got married when we were just really young i was still eighteen and he was nineteen 

127.79 130.87 B: so i don't know if we really could tell too much about 

130.89 136.75 B: what life was going to be like or not but then we were married several years before we started our family 

136.79 142.80 A: mhm i made it let's see i'm married let's see i met my husband at eighteen he was thirty 

142.88 149.46 A: [noise] uh [noise] we dated for like twelve years while i completed i wanted to complete college before we got married 

142.94 144.16 B: oh 

148.79 150.07 B: yeah 

149.52 151.74 A: and then decided to get married [noise] 

151.19 153.79 B: (( well you knew him pretty well by that [laughter] point then )) 

152.97 154.63 A: (( exactly mhm )) 

153.98 157.85 B: [mn] oh yeah that's good like i said we were just kids and 

158.18 159.89 B: kept on going to school 

160.25 167.60 B: in fact he was in the army and i was in nursing school and i stayed and when he got out of the army he worked and went to college so 

167.70 173.24 B: we just had to keep plodding along but you know teenage marriages can survive [laughter] 

174.37 175.19 B: (( but )) 

175.62 177.48 B: you've known yours that long it was 

177.50 179.28 B: like you've been married more like 

179.34 182.76 B: twenty years nearly haven't you [laughter] in a way 

180.75 182.26 A: (( hm exactly )) 

182.34 184.23 A: you kinda know it 

183.91 185.16 B: yeah 

184.91 189.37 A: [noise] uh he asked me to marry him like the first what the first month i think 

188.84 192.11 B: oh really well actually mine was 

189.44 191.41 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

192.22 194.08 B: dating my room mate [laughter] 

192.75 193.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

194.12 201.48 B: [laughter] she went home for the weekend and i don't know exactly what happened [laughter] but i ended up with him 

198.27 200.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

202.18 213.86 B: and so i guess she thinks i did her a favor probably [laughter] but uh the our kids in the dorm would say one week his picture's [noise] on my desk and one week it was on her desk [laughter] he sort of moved back and forth 

206.46 208.05 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

209.77 211.29 A: (( [laughter] )) 

215.79 216.86 B: (( but um )) 

215.88 218.49 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] what else do i look and )) 

219.00 221.03 A: (( what other qualities uh )) 

221.79 222.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

223.70 234.12 B: well you know i i don't seem like we didn't do a lot of serious discussing as i said we were so young but you know the similar religious beliefs and all that stuff you know is definitely going to affect 

224.05 224.74 A: let's 

226.49 227.07 A: (( see )) 

230.24 230.81 A: [noise]

233.68 235.14 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

234.34 240.96 B: things and but like i said i don't really think we ever got into all that much stuff at that young age 

240.48 241.74 A: (( exactly [noise] )) 

241.66 244.96 B: we were just i guess in a way we were just lucky [laughter] 

244.26 249.90 A: [noise] if you had to do it over again for some reason [noise] something happened what would you look for now [noise] 

249.42 250.53 B: (( hm )) 

251.71 252.82 B: well 

252.58 253.17 A: (( [noise] )) 

254.00 255.12 A: or would you 

255.23 260.88 B: well yeah i'd probably really wouldn't want to look again actually in reality but um 

255.94 257.16 A: [laughter] 

259.09 259.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

259.76 260.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

260.77 262.56 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

262.42 265.79 B: yeah looking from a more mature standpoint 

264.89 265.81 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

265.93 267.76 B: i guess you know 

268.00 269.78 B: i'd look for somebody that 

269.80 272.05 B: was like really stable and 

272.63 277.13 B: and you knew where he was going in life and had his goals definitely set or 

278.28 280.12 B: reached a whole lot of them maybe 

280.42 281.31 B: and 

281.92 287.33 B: probably look at things a lot different than i did at eighteen [laughter] do you think you would 

286.72 292.55 A: i think i would i'd look for someone that maybe enjoyed more of the same activities 

292.21 293.32 B: yeah 

294.82 295.69 A: (( or um )) 

297.23 298.90 B: (( i don't know it's )) 

300.04 302.62 B: well anyway we can't do it again so 

302.00 303.46 A: exactly 

302.91 303.59 B: (( yeah )) 

304.33 306.01 A: exactly but 

304.87 305.90 B: hm 

306.28 312.34 B: the other day we were fussing and my granddaughter said i don't worry when you all fuss you're too old to get a divorce 

312.47 320.27 B: i said oh i didn't realize that there was an age limit on divorce she said yeah it's over forty seven no more divorces [laughter] 

314.92 317.08 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

319.06 320.84 A: [laughter] 

320.78 321.93 B: (( so i don't know )) 

322.13 323.13 A: oh 

322.54 325.67 B: so maybe we have gotten too too old for it [laughter] 

326.19 327.39 B: hm 

328.02 332.97 B: but that i mean i guess everybody goes through stages there's days you think it sounds like a pretty good idea 

333.08 336.75 B: but then again we wouldn't really throw them away in the long run 

336.95 341.78 A: exactly you just kind of persevere through it if it's meant to be it's meant to be 

341.33 343.16 B: (( yeah have you [noise] )) 

343.39 347.49 B: oh does that mean our time is up or somebody might be trying to beep me 

343.78 344.51 A: (( oh )) 

347.70 349.30 B: did you did you hear a beep 

347.95 348.67 A: um 

348.88 350.30 A: i didn't hear a beep 

349.83 353.89 B: well i'm just gonna keep talking i'll see who it was at the end 

353.55 357.02 A: maybe it's just like the minute counter or something [noise] 

354.33 355.28 B: (( yeah )) 

355.92 364.00 B: it it was somebody beeping in another call but i'm sure we shouldn't interrupt this or it won't count or something 

363.62 366.67 A: (( yeah that's what it said in the )) 

365.28 369.17 B: yeah that sound it sounded interesting when i came across 

369.00 370.30 A: exactly 

369.81 379.04 B: this and signed up for it i thought well you know that's kind of neat and talk to people in other parts of the country and are you from that area i mean up where you live now 

377.58 378.31 A: (( [noise] hm )) 

378.90 381.72 A: yes mhm i was originally from boston 

379.76 380.45 B: (( so you're )) 

381.58 383.03 B: yeah 

381.99 384.32 A: and then we moved from boston down to whitman 

384.28 386.21 B: yeah so not too far 

385.95 386.96 A: no 

386.41 392.89 B: you know they say most people go through life not really live like more than twenty five miles or something away from home 

393.45 395.82 A: now is your husband from the same area too 

395.08 396.90 B: yeah mhm 

397.68 404.92 B: we lived in atlanta at one way back when we were first married but we had opportunity to come we did and have never really regretted it 

406.22 410.79 B: [cough] so you know i figure your life is only so long and if you're not around the people you care about 

410.72 412.16 A: exactly 

411.24 413.99 B: you're wasting it or something [laughter] you know 

414.11 416.71 A: yeah it's important to have family and 

416.06 417.90 B: yeah it is 

416.84 419.02 A: [noise] and close contacts 

418.99 422.95 B: it'd be awfully lonesome not to and 

422.96 432.26 B: to well you know your kids get sick and you don't have your mother or your grand or grandmother or you know a relative to go to for help that's gotta be pretty scary 

432.36 434.98 A: yep that it is [laughter] 

434.49 435.41 B: (( so )) 

435.62 443.56 B: but i don't know i think there's just a lot of interference on this line probably from this storm 'cause i keep hearing popping noises 

440.87 441.43 A: (( [noise] )) 

442.62 444.20 A: yeah i hear like clicks 

444.08 454.79 B: yeah i don't know if it has anything to like i said this is our first time anyone of us knows has anything to do with this or not it's the line and it's popping around here 

454.49 455.48 A: oh 

455.62 458.61 B: we have had so much storms the last few weeks 

459.18 460.76 B: but anyway 

460.90 471.27 B: so we've both decided we'd keep our life partners and we and like i said i didn't i was so young but i think we continued to 

463.56 464.89 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

471.37 479.83 B: grow up and develop some of those qualities we like would like in each other maybe [laughter] since we're still together and now we're too old to get a divorce 

479.30 482.86 A: [noise] i think you kind of you kind of become more similar 

482.99 488.74 B: oh yeah that's true mhm maybe not in looks [laughter] 

484.88 487.22 A: [laughter] when you 

488.29 494.14 A: when you actually able to finish each other's sentences and stuff it becomes just really scary [laughter] 

491.83 493.37 B: (( uh uh-huh )) 

493.69 497.86 B: doesn't it yeah i know it means we've been around a while with each other 

497.48 498.66 A: mhm 

497.87 502.00 B: [laughter] but isn't there still some surprises they come out with too 

501.72 504.15 A: [laughter] 

503.96 505.97 B: a few unexpected things 

506.01 507.46 B: along the way 

507.07 512.00 A: it's always nice when you're able to surprise after a after a while [noise] 

509.58 513.01 B: i know it you don't want to get too bored that's right 

513.30 515.90 B: well um are you all planning on more children 

515.55 519.20 A: mhm um eventually i probably will wait a couple more years i think 

518.96 521.39 B: how old are you now how old

521.57 523.80 A: thirty three i just turned thirty three 

522.45 526.45 B: yeah well i had my babies when i was almost thirty seven and 

526.62 537.20 B: our other son was fourteen years older than that but it was such a blessing he's been such a blessing to us that we think god worked that out really neat letting us have a baby when we got older 

536.83 538.10 A: mhm 

537.46 540.95 B: you know and had [noise] maternal 

540.99 552.50 B: well i guess you think if you've raised one child and managed to get him raised and he's still alive then you can probably handle another one but we we've been so much more laid back our older son says our younger son doesn't even have the same parents 

552.56 553.40 B: but

563.70 564.58 B: so 

564.66 566.27 B: yeah 

565.19 570.68 A: kind of know how to pick your battles at a certain point it's like some things just aren't worth it 

569.80 581.51 B: oh i know it just let 'em fly that's what i say don't give it's just like in traffic and people having all this road rage and i say if you all want the the right away you can have it just let me get out of your way i don't care 

579.04 580.20 A: [laughter]
