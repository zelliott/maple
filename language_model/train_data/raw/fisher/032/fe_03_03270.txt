0.51 2.45 A: hi my name's raquel 

3.52 5.28 B: hi i'm sergio 

5.01 6.09 A: [laughter] 

5.71 9.26 B: [laughter] 

6.35 14.08 A: [laughter] nice to speak with you [noise] um i guess we're supposed to talk about ah the important 

14.51 16.78 A: qualities we're looking for i guess 

17.06 19.31 A: in in terms of life partners 

20.31 24.70 B: i guess so ah well why don't we define what life partners means first 

24.79 25.67 A: okay 

25.72 27.38 B: um 

27.72 31.79 B: i take it when they mean life partners they're talking about romantic relationships 

31.42 32.38 A: sure 

32.53 43.33 B: um so i guess let's use that as the context initially and maybe base the discussion on that at first and then we can maybe even talk about friends that you have 

43.52 44.49 A: okay 

43.97 45.37 B: better 

45.68 50.53 B: friends for the rest of your life maybe they're considered life partners as well 

48.85 49.87 A: okay 

50.97 52.14 B: um 

52.49 56.62 B: what is the most well wh- what is the first trait that attracts you to ah to 

56.80 60.48 B: someone that potentially could or is your life partner 

60.68 67.77 A: um i think the most immediate thing is is physical um in terms of you know it's the first thing you see 

67.70 69.00 B: (( right )) 

67.90 70.01 A: um but obviously it's not 

70.55 75.92 A: what keeps you in the end um at least for me it's someone who i would need to 

76.41 77.81 A: (( ah respect )) 

78.41 79.54 A: um 

79.91 82.18 A: and someone who's compatible 

81.41 84.55 B: (( [noise] )) 

83.60 88.09 A: ah whether it's um you know shared values or shared goals 

88.35 89.66 A: um 

89.80 101.32 A: or even you know simple preferences could ah whether you know it could be someone who's more of a country person whereas i'm more of a city person and that could potentially lead to problems later down the road 

101.17 102.28 B: sure 

101.60 105.41 A: um even though in the beginning it's probably not that big a deal 

105.01 107.11 B: (( mhm )) 

106.56 111.55 A: ah so i think those are the main things compatibility just because it's 

111.59 114.57 A: ah i think in the beginning things are always 

114.84 123.11 A: [mn] you know people always expect kind of that that high and i think the best ships are the ones that can um work out 

123.21 124.65 A: r- regardless 

124.83 126.85 A: you know it it can sort of test 

126.86 127.85 A: um 

128.74 132.34 A: stand the test of time and and go through like a lot of people 

132.69 135.32 A: most people will change obviously 

135.49 150.43 A: to a degree and some people are able to deal with those changes and others don't and i always hear that as a sort of complaint from couples you know it's like oh he used to be like this or she used to be like that and i think it's the inability to adjust to that 

150.48 153.05 A: um that also creates problems 

152.50 155.24 B: mhm why do think they've changed 

155.61 159.53 A: it's life i mean everything's changing around us 

159.54 167.29 A: so it only ah follows logically that we would change as well ah not necessarily that 

166.67 181.14 B: you think it's 'cause maybe their professional life is is becoming more of a focus so they they become more geared in that fashion and then maybe they resent the other the other person that they're not as involved in their professional life is it a money 

181.03 187.28 A: yeah it it could be that or it could be the opposite you know perhaps in the beginning people really place a lot of value on that 

184.87 190.23 B: (( thing )) 

187.40 188.44 A: um 

188.42 203.12 A: and this what i how i usually see it is that it's people um when they're younger they place a lot of value and that and then as they get older they look back and see other things they wished they could've done differently and then place more of a focus on family and on relationships 

202.30 203.76 B: (( or )) 

203.11 211.98 A: um i think that's the typical pattern but of course could it could go either way i think that sort of is the more normal thing that that happens 

207.68 222.40 B: so do you think we're we ah have a better or worse chance of having long term relationships today than we did a hundred years ago maybe not a hundred years ago but maybe two decades ago 

212.15 213.11 A: um 

220.89 227.37 A: i think the expectations are much higher these days um as especially in new york 

223.65 225.36 B: (( mhm )) 

227.39 236.68 A: i d- i don't know where you are um but um ah i live in new york and the expectation's always you know everything's replaceable everything's 

236.91 241.91 A: um you know if it's not working find something new and and everything's a a quick fix 

242.12 245.59 A: so i think it's more the attitude of um 

245.69 248.17 A: replacing everything including people 

248.46 253.93 A: ah easily rather than trying to make it work with the person you're currently with 

249.62 254.89 B: [mn] 

254.20 267.60 A: um i mean i know people who are like thirty and already twice divorced so it's i think it's more of the expectation that's placed these days ah you know and it falls into careers as well i mean there was an expectation 

258.57 259.24 B: (( [noise] )) 

267.65 269.68 A: you know not so long ago where 

269.55 282.96 A: um it always obviously be the wife home and there was never a thought of her working and having a family as well and um i think it's the same thing [mn] with relationships the expectation of relationships has changed 

282.93 284.90 A: and also depending on 

284.93 288.68 A: ah i i would imagine it's different very different if you grew up in ah 

288.87 291.03 A: a smaller community you know 

288.93 294.31 B: well do you think let me ask you this if ah with all the advances in technology 

294.87 300.64 B: um cars are becoming more efficient ah cell phones are becoming better 

302.42 305.03 B: why is it that relationships are deteriorating 

306.16 315.16 A: again i think it's it's because of the expectations these days where because of that there's always something better and this is the thinking 

315.13 323.80 A: that um whatever you whatever you have and now it's like even applied to people that there's something better 

324.00 325.65 B: what tools do you use 

324.13 325.06 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

325.70 327.62 B: if any to 

327.81 332.45 B: kind of ah filter who potentially could be a partner of yours 

332.90 334.20 B: (( do you use any )) 

333.89 335.19 A: (( ah )) 

335.29 336.43 A: i guess just 

335.68 338.20 B: would you use any would you just use 

337.44 351.52 A: sure ju- well you can get a good sense of someone just in speaking with them and finding out number one what what they do for a living can give you an indicator it can it doesn't necessarily you know lots of people will do things but that's not the what they wanna do they're 

348.78 349.37 B: (( judg- )) 

351.54 358.41 A: you know in school or whatever else it may be um but it can give you an indicator of what's important to them 

358.09 359.37 B: [mn] 

358.55 362.21 A: and what their priorities are and um 

363.09 374.56 A: you know i think that's that's one way to to gauge it i mean a lot ah i meet do a lot of volunteer and i it's definitely a different breed of people um who do that versus if i 

371.73 372.75 B: (( sure )) 

374.73 376.20 A: you know i don't know 

375.47 379.39 B: wall street banker [laughter] 

376.36 385.47 A: yeah exactly so i think there's a lot that you tell um from that it's not the be all and end all but there are definitely um patterns 

385.48 388.55 A: to that and ah 

386.61 387.19 B: (( do )) 

387.86 398.08 B: you think we're gonna be more robotic with these new tools coming out could it be less of emphasis would be on emotional and more of it would be on functional this person matches because 

399.20 403.80 B: this this this they play the same sports they like the same type of music they're into 

403.17 407.44 A: no i don't i don't think so 'cause there are a lot of people who i guess are 

407.65 415.06 A: technically compatible um but there's no chemistry you know it's almost more of a a brother or a sister type of thing 

414.83 419.67 B: so how do you measure the chemistry is there any formula is is anyone gonna be able to 

418.47 421.67 A: i honestly think that's probably where the physical might come in 

421.90 434.98 A: um i i think that may be that there are guys who i think are great guys but i'm not um physically attracted to them and no matter how great i think they are that that element is just not present 

435.29 447.53 A: um and we may be compatible in every other way except for that um but it can also be the opposite where there's ah someone who i am physically attracted to but on every other level there's there's nothing there 

446.98 449.21 B: (( mhm )) 

447.54 461.13 A: um so you know again i don't think there's i think that's why it's so difficult to find the right person it's because it it's not there's no right formula it involves so many different things having to fall into place correctly 

461.36 463.32 A: and um 

463.54 466.33 A: you know i know lots of people who have ah 

466.37 475.16 A: lots of different relationships and still haven't found the right person i don't even think it's even so much a numbers game i just think it's very difficult to find 

475.17 479.88 A: the right match i mean it's easy to find someone if you're it depends on also what you're looking for 

479.72 482.72 B: so do you think we we're much more picky 

480.00 480.97 A: you know 

482.74 485.87 B: today than than we were ah 

486.74 488.15 B: years back 

487.32 495.97 A: i think so yes i think years back there was more of a feeling of ah i mean it'd be considered settling you know if you um 

496.03 501.31 A: weren't with [mn] the person who had every single quality perhaps that you were looking for 

501.33 507.59 A: ah whereas years back it was sort of more [mn] expected that this is how life is and 

506.49 509.94 B: [mn] but now we're picky 'cause we're at a buffet table and there's 

510.02 513.40 B: endless choices and we don't know where to start and where and end 

512.50 513.68 A: right 

513.86 518.68 A: which isn't necessarily a bad thing you know i'm i'm nor am i [mn] 

517.26 519.97 B: [laughter] [mn] so we delay our choices 

520.37 529.00 B: ah we we just delay our choices further and further do you think that's true like getting married later people having kids later 

525.59 533.25 A: ah oh yeah definitely i definitely and of course there's also the whole the gender gap where for men it's easier 

533.26 534.34 A: um 

534.47 539.54 A: to delay it meaning that there's a lot of cases with older men and younger women 

539.49 540.71 B: [noise] 

539.78 546.14 A: um but not really [mn] it's sort of frowned upon or seen as strange when it's the reverse 

546.20 554.41 A: so the opportunities still are just as much for a man as he gets older um but not really for ah ah an older woman 

553.84 558.04 B: mhm would you would you go for an older man 

558.57 565.18 A: ah absolutely i mean it depends on how much older if we're talking like you know i would think 

560.55 566.31 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

565.73 571.43 A: fifteen to twenty max you know i don't wanna get to the point where i feel like i'm with my father 

571.06 573.37 B: [mn] right 

571.54 574.24 A: um so i think that would be the maximum 

573.88 575.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

574.25 581.34 A: um but you can never even tell i mean i would only say that thinking ah you know you associate 

581.45 588.28 A: age with maturity and and wisdom and again that's also not necessarily the case where i know guys who are 

588.29 593.23 A: [noise] you know much younger and and have the maturity level of someone much older and vice versa 

593.60 596.03 A: but i would i would not um 

596.27 599.89 A: i might object to dating to someone younger at first ah
