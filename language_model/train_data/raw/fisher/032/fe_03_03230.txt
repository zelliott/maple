92.60 93.82 A: really 

103.12 105.08 A: [noise] oh wow 

103.73 117.36 B: [noise] so because of the kids you know giving them keys and having all that out and available i'd just as soon keep a a live security system that keeps the house safe at the same time as uh being an affectionate pet 

116.37 118.37 A: (( [noise] mm [noise] uh-huh uh )) 

117.48 127.17 B: i spend hours well from the minute i get home from work till the minute i go to bed they they both come to my bed and ask for their goodnight strokes 

126.76 127.73 A: wow 

127.90 133.52 A: that's great i can't imagine not locking my door though and having a pet like [laughter] to protect me [mn] [noise] 

128.91 129.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

132.88 146.98 B: [noise] well [noise] when when you have something like this here you know i've i've lived with them [noise] for over ten years now and [noise] they're a one owner dog they really are and the nice thing about them is because of that 

141.72 142.70 A: mhm 

146.98 157.87 B: [noise] nobody else is really friend if you're not home they are completely on guard they're adamant they'll they'll bark they'll bite they'll chew they'll attack

164.44 174.97 B: good and friendly to and whatnot but people they don't trust they make very clear that they don't trust and i find it best and advisable not to trust the people my dogs don't trust 

174.41 175.99 A: (( [mn] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

175.39 186.98 B: because those people have proven time and time again to try to break into the house and they've been caught in the end by the dogs which have paid for their worth they have stopped people from getting in the house

487.34 488.30 A: mhm 

488.86 489.44 A: (( mm )) 

488.95 489.90 B: (( it [noise] )) 

490.05 494.56 B: it brings the niche between owner and uh animal a lot closer 

493.73 495.26 A: yeah yeah 

494.57 502.01 B: um i don't know what i'd do without my bandit i i i'm taken here he is he's getting fairly old so i
