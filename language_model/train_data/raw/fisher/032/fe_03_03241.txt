148.51 152.42 A: and that he pretty much can control things [sigh] 

152.36 167.14 A: and i pretty much believed that like i have a relative that's always telling me [sigh] be careful when you're out there every time i go out and she kind of stopped because [sigh] i told her there's nothing you could do at times [sigh] just like with the death of a loved one 

153.87 155.08 B: right 

166.72 167.68 B: (( uh-hum )) 

167.54 180.32 A: um you may not want them to go but [sigh] you know and several funerals i had death in the family quite a few times recently [sigh] and the preacher even said there's nothing you could do about that [sigh] 

180.51 190.83 B: [mn] yeah well you know i always stick myself to that point i mean if there's something i have to do i just go ahead on and do it [sigh] 'cause you're right i mean if somethings gonna happen there's nothing you can do 

189.86 192.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] no matter how careful )) 

191.30 206.03 B: uh-huh no so you just yeah i mean if you th- that don't stop your every day ah activities or living i mean 'cause you can't predict anything i mean you s- stuff could happen to you up in your own house before you even get out the door [mn] 

205.13 216.19 A: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] yeah and i also have um [sigh] created an awareness like watching the news more carefully i've always watched it but [sigh] even more carefully and 

211.15 213.24 B: (( yeah i do that too [cough] )) 

216.23 223.52 A: i've always watched the news i used to joke about it but it's really not funny i said [laughter] it could be someone right next door to you 

222.96 224.37 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

223.32 235.86 A: [sigh] that's doing stuff like did you ever get people that say [sigh] well i don't watch the news it you know it's always something bad [sigh] and i don't want to see it i say well i do you you you have to be informed 

235.41 247.03 B: yeah you do [mn] yes and there's so much that's going on [sigh] um you know i- it it would behoove you to watch the news [laughter] to tell you the truth [laughter] [laughter] [noise] 

244.76 251.04 A: [sigh] [sigh] and also it um any a- after ah the september eleventh i um 

251.33 265.52 A: [sigh] i also wanted to reach out and try to help as much as i could [sigh] and at this point right now i feel inadequate 'cause i don't know how to help [sigh] i'm always reading articles in the paper and watching the news and other 

265.33 275.78 A: [sigh] ah talk shows and stuff like that maybe they'll key you in as to [sigh] how you could help [sigh] ah people that are grieving it must be a tremendous [sigh] to h- have 

275.55 286.74 A: say a father that was killed in that or a mother that was killed in that [sigh] and a lot of them heard the voices r- [sigh] they got a call maybe on the cellphone right before that 

285.44 287.71 B: (( [noise] y- y- yeah yeah [noise] )) 

287.04 290.91 A: it must be tr- a a a a tremendous stress [sigh] [noise] [noise] 

290.49 300.00 B: [sigh] well i imagine that it th- that it is but ah having experienced death ah so many times myself um [mn] certainly there's really not much a person can do 

300.32 304.23 B: [mn] [noise] ah and and sometimes it really kind of hurts to ah 

304.15 316.52 B: have someone constantly saying that they're sorry [sigh] so ah it it's something that i don't know it's places that you have to go deep within yourself [mn] ah to grieve [mn] and ah 

315.12 318.27 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] and even yeah okay [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

317.28 326.13 B: yeah in some instances it might even require you know that you go to a psychiatrist [sigh] someone might need counselling or something ah of that nature mm [noise] [noise] [noise] 

324.78 328.56 A: [sigh] yeah i can imagine because um there's a 

328.57 332.94 A: [mn] i probably have been affected by that too [sigh] in that [sigh] 

332.72 344.39 A: a trem- ah traumatic events in your life d- d- do often times require counselling [sigh] and extensive counselling with no real [sigh] the only result is that you [sigh] 

344.53 355.75 A: sort of come to grips with the loss but who could really you can't replace that and that's a rude awakening in itself i imagine that for me too [sigh] 

355.21 356.36 B: yeah 

355.78 361.81 A: you know i i often think what would have happened if that was someone close to me 

361.82 368.32 A: [sigh] i had a relative [sigh] a distant relative up in that area [mn] and um 

368.71 376.79 A: her brother was trying to reach her who was a good friend of mine [sigh] i say relative she's like an aunt to my my son 

373.07 373.69 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

376.95 383.68 A: and he he was ju- keep saying he can't reach her can't reach her and i was really feeling the effects 

383.53 395.79 A: [sigh] and you know back to the changes i just [sigh] really want to key in as to why they're attributing [sigh] ah a lot of fighting in the war now [sigh] to what happened then 

395.90 406.84 B: [noise] [sigh] i don't know the whole thing is m- [laughter] mixed up to me 'cause i don't see [sigh] that's not what he went over there for i mean you know he went over there for ma- ah weapons of mass destruction [sigh] so [mn] [mn] y- 

406.14 415.94 A: [sigh] yeah but he keyed in you know he keyed in is that's one of the reasons [sigh] why he went on ahead full steam ahead 

415.62 429.55 B: y- yeah [mn] well i i i i don't know i i'm kind of ah um leary [mn] of the administration of the government i i don't trust what they're saying especially bush so [lipsmack] um i don't know 

429.55 441.70 A: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] well i don't think it's just bush i think it's a lot [sigh] you know politicians in general [sigh] that can just sit back and i really came to see that [sigh] um 

430.29 430.90 B: (( [sigh] )) 

435.94 437.07 B: (( uh-hum )) 

441.56 447.78 A: making excuses here we got something that happened you know a a year ago 

447.67 451.47 A: [sigh] and we're just going to ah k- keep using that [sigh] 

451.26 453.35 A: you know to go kill mass ah 

453.20 466.26 A: you know for mass murder or whatever that's what i see it as [sigh] as a big excuse [sigh] and it really makes me see as an aftermath of september eleventh how [sigh] we don't really have a lot of say you 

454.87 456.21 B: (( uh-hum )) 

466.12 469.69 A: it goes back to [sigh] going to the polls to vote 

469.15 470.50 B: yeah 

470.08 480.06 A: [sigh] [sigh] how many people say i'm not going nowhere i'm not going out there well it hasn't changed my voting pattern [sigh] i'm going to voice my opinion 

470.52 471.73 B: that's true 

472.70 474.27 B: mhm 

474.94 475.62 B: (( uh-huh )) 

479.91 481.02 B: yeah 

481.40 491.53 B: [sigh] well that's true but i imagine a lot of 'em got this way since they they voted and then they turned it into such a fiasco [mn] down in florida an- and other places so 

491.86 502.18 B: [mn] but i guess you had the the thing is you have to just keep on going [sigh] if you expect to change anything you can't be the one that sits by and complains and then don't try to do anything about it 

502.15 503.94 A: (( [sigh] [noise] uh-hum )) 

503.27 504.46 B: [sigh] so um 

504.38 515.66 A: oh yeah i agree with that i agree with that a lot because [sigh] you know it even focuses in on [mn] community issues and how [sigh] you know 

515.81 526.08 A: city state and federal government just [sigh] to you it may seem like they just do whatever they want to do re- regardless of taxing regardless of voting 

523.60 524.92 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

526.14 534.42 A: [sigh] you know you got out there you sign a million petitions [sigh] and you never see things go what you think is okay 

533.80 535.23 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

534.50 543.49 A: you know safe environment stuff like that things are convenient [sigh] for you and your children if you have any family members [sigh] um 

543.32 553.90 A: to make life better [sigh] it seems like all he's concerned about is [sigh] putting on that big pretty suit [sigh] travelling worldwide with his wife and g- god knows who else 

553.88 568.86 A: [sigh] you know [sigh] that's just like when rendell got into office and i saw him with all those people [sigh] that he fed [sigh] they said they were thousands of families and friends i was like my god who has that many f- [laughter] family and friends [sigh] and who's paying for it 

565.92 567.99 B: [laughter] 

568.33 569.47 B: yeah 

568.63 580.74 A: and you should have that answer and we're not provided that [sigh] and i could see that even more [sigh] so it it pretty much tees in to [sigh] my feelings of inadequacy 

580.46 581.56 B: yeah 

581.57 585.08 B: [mn] i think a lot of people are feeling that including myself 

585.62 587.10 B: (( [sigh] you know but ah )) 

587.29 591.69 A: [sigh] [sigh] but i do think the september eleventh thing kind of like [sigh] you know 

591.78 599.89 A: scared because after that after that everything else was dos and don't [sigh] then you got the anthrax [sigh] [laughter] don't go out there because 

592.14 593.86 B: well it changed 

599.58 599.89 B: (( mm ))
