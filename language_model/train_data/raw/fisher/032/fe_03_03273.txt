128.27 129.73 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

130.51 132.76 A: that sort of stuff so i don't really 

133.99 135.66 B: so um 

135.88 144.40 B: so what okay but so even if there you don't think there's one ultimate person like what do you think would be your person that would 

144.77 148.21 B: probably stay with you the longest if that's possible you know 

149.03 152.32 A: oh oh the longest [laughter] 

150.57 156.77 B: yeah i mean like what what's like a quality like the one quality you really look for in people i think that's sort of what they're getting at

161.99 162.77 A: i

172.68 175.19 A: [mn] i don't know like not very like 

176.03 178.15 A: tied down to 

178.48 191.07 A: like a geog- geographic places you know when it comes to like locating themself in the world like i'm really i have to admit like i'm really into people that are like doing things for their community hm 

188.87 190.09 B: adventuresome 

190.74 192.05 B: adventuresome 

192.52 196.46 A: yeah well not really i mean like i'm not very if if you're thinking about like 

196.89 198.53 A: (( [mn] you know physical )) 

198.46 206.30 A: types of like [laughter] like you know we think about adventuresome like you know kind of going out and doing stuff like that i'm not really like that i 

206.22 216.35 A: i mean like i'm more into kind of going into communities and seeing what type of activism people are doing for their community but like how 'bout you like what do you look 

216.06 217.52 B: [sigh] god 

217.83 224.16 B: um well i do i do believe in life partners and it's so funny because i've been reading this book about um 

224.30 239.18 B: twin flames and it talks about you know how at your incarnation whenever the hell that was there was you know two of you created and [sigh] i do- i mean i've never met this person yet so i'm sort of going on blind faith but [laughter] i would say that um 

239.17 249.08 B: i'm really looking for someone who is interested in delving inside and finding out why we are the way we are like i'm i'm really into psychology um 

245.93 247.13 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

249.29 250.50 B: i find 

250.56 262.68 B: all that really fascinating and i find that in- when i'm hanging out with a guy or even a girl but i mean i'm not so much into girls but you know when i'm hanging out with anybody i always want to find out why 

262.72 264.25 B: we do what we do 

264.54 265.55 B: you know 

265.46 267.95 A: (( y- yeah yeah )) 

265.68 266.28 B: (( [mn] )) 

266.78 279.02 B: so like if i'm with a guy i'll be like well why did you you know just say that not in an accusatory way but i just want someone who is willing to be [sigh] um like i guess introspective or intuitive 

278.94 281.91 B: you know someone who's i guess really conscious 

282.13 283.25 A: mhm 

282.21 288.83 B: [sigh] um 'cause there's so many people out there who just sort of blow caution at the wind and you know 

288.85 296.24 B: act they they just they're reactionary and they do things and they don't think about their consequences or or how it can affect people 

294.51 297.87 A: mhm mhm mhm 

297.89 312.80 B: so that's sort of what i'm into and uh [laughter] and it's been tough to find that because like i'm twenty six and i live in l. a. and the guys that are out here are very [sigh] fast and they just wanna you know 

312.95 321.70 B: like have sex and get the hell out of there and it's so rare when you find a guy who's truly looking for a relationship and if you do it's someone who's like oh 

321.82 325.80 B: really freaky and who's never had a girlfriend [laughter] 

324.64 330.39 A: (( [laughter] okay okay that's interesting )) 

326.15 326.83 B: (( you know )) 

328.01 328.95 B: yeah 

330.43 332.95 B: [laughter] how did you find out about this study 

330.95 332.47 A: yeah 

333.37 336.22 A: well i've got i was on craig's list 

335.68 336.79 B: oh really 

336.52 340.84 A: yeah and i was looking at some like like i was uh 

341.13 345.23 A: well usually like when i'm bored at work i go [laughter] to craig's list and look for stuff 

345.09 357.59 A: [sigh] and um so i was just looking at what the categories that they had like i i i have another internship so i wouldn't be able to like get another part time job or anything but i was just kinda looking at stuff and my friend is coming 

345.11 346.15 B: oh wow mhm 

357.56 361.19 A: here and so i found this i thought this is really interesting 

361.26 365.50 A: but then like i don't think i filled out the information right [laughter] i don't know 

365.56 366.66 B: oh really 

365.62 375.13 A: but i yeah i don't know but i didn't i really didn't think it was real like i didn't think it was real at all and then i kept on getting these calls and i this is my first time actually talking to anyone 

374.82 375.91 B: oh really 

375.28 382.80 A: (( so yeah i've nev- i've never spoken to anyone on this and like i've only been i've only been on it for like two days i guess two or three days )) 

381.94 386.69 B: yeah this is my second day too i i talked yesterday about pets [laughter] 

386.23 387.81 A: oh that's interesting 

387.42 388.53 B: yeah 

388.26 391.35 A: yeah okay [laughter] [mn] 

390.22 400.50 B: it's pretty fascinating i i talked to some woman in new orleans yesterday and she's like married with kids and and you know in all honesty i'm a reality t._v. producer 

400.63 401.57 B: so 

400.93 402.51 A: (( oh seriously )) 

402.06 409.21 B: yeah so this is really fascinating to me and i i am getting a bunch of different ideas for shows off of this so [laughter] 

408.60 413.56 A: that's so funny 'cause i was i was just i don't know i mean i i live in d. c. right now 

413.12 413.95 B: uh-huh 

413.71 419.50 A: so um it's a really funny place to be living [laughter] in right now that's so interesting i like 

419.54 423.52 A: yeah i could definitely see something like this being on a 

424.21 432.33 A: i i don't know how that would work out but [laughter] yeah like a reality show okay yeah that's really funny it's interesting 

426.19 427.57 B: on a reality show 

431.89 437.76 B: yeah there's something here there's an idea here but it it's brewing and i've gotta sorta think about it [mn] 

437.40 439.83 A: mhm mhm 

438.11 442.92 B: you know [mn] i'm totally fascinated i wanna find out like well first off how old are you 

443.26 444.44 A: i'm twenty 

444.10 445.54 B: you're twenty okay 

445.07 446.07 A: mhm 

445.66 451.51 B: and um like are you do you consider yourself bi or do you consider yourself like lesbian 

452.21 457.54 A: i well i mean for me like my identity isn't fixed you know like i 

457.29 458.27 B: (( oh okay )) 

457.81 459.83 A: like i really don't 

460.39 464.32 A: i really don't actually like define myself 

460.45 461.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

464.80 476.31 A: in the way because i mean like mainly like i'm attracted to women but also i i can like i mean i'm with this guy sort of and then you know like i'm into trans people too and so 

476.31 482.10 A: it just for me like my sexuality and my gender aren't like fixed at all and they're very fluid 

480.70 481.73 B: oh wow 

482.54 488.25 A: so i mean that's how i i mean i feel like like all these things are constructions and they're like from a historical 

488.30 501.71 A: context and a historical like place and like it's their reality in terms of like how people look at them but for me like i'm also trying to subvert you know the the way that people see these identities 

498.59 499.31 B: (( hm mm )) 

501.59 504.11 A: and so that's my 

504.11 514.07 A: like i mean like i when i it depends on where i am like sometimes i tell people i'm a lesbian because like i can't deal with like some men talking to me [laughter] and like trying to you know 

511.75 512.84 B: oh right 

513.84 520.82 A: be in my face and i'll be like no you can't you know and also like for me like my identities are very like whenever i s- say 

521.25 524.03 A: how i'd identify it's very political you know 

523.76 524.78 B: (( oh okay )) 

524.37 525.29 A: (( so um )) 

525.72 526.97 A: [lipsmack] like that's 

525.87 528.58 B: well yeah you're in d. c. [laughter] 

528.01 533.49 A: [laughter] yeah d. c.'s interesting [laughter] but um yeah but that's 

534.37 537.50 A: i don't know things could change i i'm not very like 

537.66 541.15 A: i'm not gonna think that i'm gonna be in this place forever but yeah 

540.81 544.90 B: right yeah well you're definitely young too and um 

545.18 557.61 B: and and i'm not saying this from a condescending point at all like i i you know people used to say oh you're still young you'll have your whole life to de- to decide things and it's very true and i i hated hearing that from people but it's it's true like you know 

557.56 562.35 B: do whatever you want now 'cause it's now's the time to experiment and have a good time you know 

562.56 572.16 A: [mn] no yeah i mean that's that's very true i mean i i like every day is like you know you can't really count on whether you'll be here the next day you know so 

571.09 572.40 B: (( exactly no oh )) 

572.51 582.45 A: it's yeah so that's that's kinda my thought process right now but yeah having these relationships is really difficult right now [laughter] but with 

583.09 587.09 A: these people but um yeah whatever [laughter] 

586.30 590.16 B: man yeah that that must be really confusing i can't even imagine what that [laughter] 

590.44 593.39 A: i mean it's not it's not really confusing and 

593.48 596.20 A: i mean i'm confused but like i 

596.53 599.95 A: [mn] i i'm more worried about like hurting
