191.96 194.39 A: [laughter] so then 

194.78 200.67 A: kinda you know how you you don't really love somebody but then you fall in love with them that's exactly what happened 

198.07 199.93 B: right exactly 

200.13 207.54 B: oh that's good well you know what they say like a lot of times that that's the best way you know because at least you have that it's almost like a 

204.48 205.45 A: right 

206.44 208.27 A: well you get to know the person 

207.92 219.27 B: right without all that you know uh lust and all that stuff factoring in so oh that's wonderful i can't believe fourteen years i just can't even imagine that is amazing 

211.64 213.71 A: right right [laughter] 

219.08 220.24 A: yeah 

219.38 227.43 B: oh my gosh now gosh what else can we talk about [laughter] this is so hard i was wondering what kind of topics they were gonna come up if they were you know

227.20 239.71 B: i guess when i see fisher i was thinking like fisher price i'm thinking god i hope they don't want to talk about children's toys because i thought i have no kids i know nothing about that stuff so i feel so bad my poor nephew he just turned six two weeks ago 

234.18 236.01 A: (( [laughter] )) 

239.44 240.32 A: (( oh )) 

239.67 251.79 B: and the best i could give him was like a gift card to the k._b. toys i'm like here you go yeah i would have no clue what i was looking for but he likes that that way he gets to run through the toy store and exactly so he's thrilled to death but uh 

243.78 244.64 A: all

256.47 257.37 A: right 

262.17 264.58 A: [laughter]

349.46 350.80 A: [laughter] 

349.94 355.70 B: but it was still i mean fifteen we had jobs like you know straight on from like fifteen till present day i mean 

355.49 369.86 B: because my parents like look if you don't have the money for yourself you're not getting it [laughter] we cover the the food and the housing [laughter] after that you're on your own so but it's kinda good i mean because you get a good work ethic you know when you're younger when you do it that way so

519.36 530.51 B: yeah well yeah i mean it took you ten years to get around to that huh [laughter] oh that's great though but that's nice like you said that at least you guys had that background and you knew i mean 

523.05 524.78 A: [laughter] 

529.92 531.21 A: mhm 

530.36 537.08 B: if if you know somebody for fourteen years you know you're gonna get along you know what i mean there's nothing that a piece of paper's gonna change so that's that's really good 

533.20 534.28 A: mhm 

535.36 536.27 A: right 

536.92 548.28 B: that's amazing especially like you said if you had that many kids together you've got some vested interest in making things work and so that's fantastic oh see that's great that is wonderful oh i'm so jealous 

536.98 537.96 A: right 

542.68 545.68 A: yeah and we're best friends so that helps a lot

549.20 550.30 B: really 

550.53 556.38 B: oh my god see that's that's good though i would love to be able to eventually find something like that 

556.12 563.65 A: well see if we would ever divorce i'd feel comfortable that if we'd ever divorce that you know if we can't couldn't make it work 

560.10 561.00 B: mhm 

563.37 564.65 B: right 

564.02 572.46 A: that we would still be it you know there would be a period where i hate you da da da but then we would still be best friends 'cause we know too much about each other 

568.13 569.15 B: right 

571.90 580.93 B: see that is that is great and that's the thing that i always tell people it's like if i would ever be in a relationship and like it would end i want to make sure like i can still at least be friends with that person you know 

580.38 581.30 A: right 

580.95 590.84 B: you know i can't imagine like having spending that much time with somebody i can understand some of these people when something really bad happens and you hate their guts but for the most part you think gosh you've been through so much together 

587.23 588.23 A: mhm 

590.44 591.56 A: right 

590.96 595.95 B: you know you have to at least like the person afterwards especially if you have kids involved
