307.77 321.36 A: w- you know ah we just always said if we felt that we didn't love each other or like ea- [noise] you know each other any more 'cause i realize sometimes [noise] people change uh that we just be up front with the other person 

317.80 318.85 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

321.17 322.61 B: that's nice 

322.69 324.23 A: and um 

325.84 337.34 A: i i don't know we just didn't everything is [mn] like a um i'm not working now but when i was all the money we earned went into one pot it wasn't your money and his money 

336.93 338.83 B: right 

337.95 342.68 A: and maybe i'm more of the old fashioned school or something that way but 

343.42 346.89 A: we kind of always decided what to spend the big bucks on 

343.50 344.46 B: right 

346.79 350.04 B: [laughter] that's nice 

347.59 348.35 A: (( [laughter] )) 

349.88 355.27 A: you know he buys his own toys or tools i call his tools toys but 

355.06 356.20 B: right 

355.56 361.26 A: he tells me you know how much money they save us when he uses them but um 

362.71 365.70 A: i i i like i say honesty is a big thing 

365.53 366.82 B: (( okay [lipsmack] right )) 

365.77 367.34 A: i i think 

367.86 374.21 A: and that you always need a sense of humour i think because you know life has it's ups and downs 

371.12 372.48 B: [laughter] 

374.13 375.45 B: yeah 

374.81 375.88 A: (( uh-huh i )) 

376.43 378.24 B: oh that's interesting 

378.02 379.15 A: (( mean if you can )) 

379.30 383.59 B: do you have any questions for myself it seems like i've been doing all the asking 

384.18 391.10 A: ah let's see well um have you ever been in sort of a serious relationship 

391.29 392.64 B: um 

392.74 400.09 B: sixth grade [laughter] [laughter] and i think i decided then that was enough [laughter] 

393.90 394.87 A: [laughter] 

398.95 400.78 A: that that was enough huh 

400.39 402.98 B: yeah i i learned pretty quick so 

403.62 411.98 B: ah yeah i mean i- it's i don't how it is you know generation wise or if it changes or not but i guess for ah 

412.06 414.57 B: my generation i i'm in the twenties 

414.41 415.62 A: okay 

415.17 424.30 B: right so um [lipsmack] i guess for my generation it's it's you know the environment's a lot different than when ah you had grown up 

424.05 425.15 A: right 

424.50 429.94 B: so it's i you know it's pretty much like any business deal you know i 

430.18 434.17 B: you could say love or whatnot but um i mean 

434.38 441.49 B: [mn] for me it would actually be kinda nice to have someone be straightforward and honest and approach it from that standpoint like 

441.47 452.36 B: you know you have something i need i have something you need let's write out a contract [laughter] and ah you know w- whether it be monetary or [mn] you know status wise or whatever i i think 

443.43 444.47 A: uh-huh 

452.16 460.47 B: that would be something that would definitely [sigh] ah be a virtuous quality in today's age because you know today 

460.53 462.53 B: there's so much cover up 

462.22 463.57 A: right 

462.93 474.77 B: you know so it's you know a bad situation never happened but pretty much ah i'm a i'm a pretty very straightforward person and a lot of people find that intimidating 

474.60 475.26 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

475.11 480.32 B: and so i don't really go out of my way to you know 

480.39 484.39 B: you know have to have this person or that person type of deal 

484.44 485.76 B: um 

485.80 488.00 B: i'm just kinda waiting for 

488.05 498.49 B: the approach to happen because i think it takes ah especially from the opposite sex i think it takes a lot of ah determination and grit and that's another 

498.94 504.61 B: ah characteristic that i i think is important in terms of having a life partner 

504.74 509.07 B: ah just 'cause as you said you know there's good times and bad times so 

508.07 508.90 A: yeah 

509.14 515.58 B: you need you need someone i guess you know to to be out for themselves first that's what i'm looking for so that 

515.59 518.86 B: ah there is not you know a whole lot of 

519.07 523.08 B: lying and conniving going on ah just honesty like you said is fine 

522.72 524.47 A: (( [noise] right i and )) 

523.09 527.14 B: whether it's hurtful or nice doesn't matter [laughter] 

526.63 538.52 A: i know almost if like if my daughter got really serious about somebody these days and all and i this may sound crass but if you get really serious with someone you almost should check 'em out 

538.32 540.02 B: yeah i mean that's 

540.03 541.58 A: you know like 

540.15 540.91 B: (( it's a [mn] )) 

541.61 549.34 A: finance or just see their if they have a police record or you know have a private eye or however you do that you know 

547.45 550.83 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah it )) 

549.81 557.85 A: to make sure i mean you know so you know the guy says he's unmarried or something maybe he's got two wives you know what i mean 

557.47 561.59 B: yeah i mean in my opinion and this is just my opinion so 

561.67 564.22 B: ah you know take it as it is i 

564.43 571.07 B: i really don't think that [laughter] a real man should get married um tied down 'cause 

571.24 585.50 B: there's i- it's you know this it you get it's a sexist view from wh- what a lot of people have told me but i- in today's world there's just a lot of lacking things and one of them is just the leadership 

585.43 599.89 B: and the courage that ah people need to have to to step forward and just you know overcome things like fear and in today's culture you know the men running around claiming to be men i mean their manhood is based on how many wo-
