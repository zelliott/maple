10.56 11.60 A: oh 

11.88 18.12 A: well i'm gonna start by asking you [laughter] what do you think you need to find in a lifelong partner

14.56 16.42 B: [laughter] okay 

18.27 22.59 B: you know truth telling i don't have one but if i had 

20.82 21.87 A: mhm 

23.28 25.82 B: [lipsmack] probably trust 

25.41 26.50 A: yeah 

26.09 27.42 B: yeah 

26.84 39.87 A: yeah well i've been married for going on fifteen years and i've three boys and i'll tell you what trust is a very big issue [sigh] um it is something that if it's broken it's very hard to rebuild 

31.05 31.97 B: wow 

39.71 40.77 B: yeah 

40.09 50.37 A: um [lipsmack] also i think you know you have to have your communication open [noise] because a lot of trust is broken down because of not having the uh the trust issue 

49.14 50.79 B: yeah yeah 

50.61 58.19 A: um when you know if you think about it if a partner doesn't open up to you that that breaks down your your trust in the partner 

56.90 57.99 B: (( right )) 

58.43 62.62 A: so i agree i think trust is very big but you know you you've gotta 

62.82 63.94 A: um 

63.95 70.05 A: know enough about each other and um be willing to give and take 

70.20 77.51 A: with a lifelong partner it cannot be one sided a lot of people go into um [lipsmack] 

71.23 72.29 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

77.93 86.59 A: into relationships thinking that they can change the other partner and i have learned that you cannot change each other only that person can change 

87.55 88.85 A: (( so [noise] )) 

89.29 91.70 A: um where do you live 

89.65 90.81 B: (( mm yeah )) 

91.93 92.90 B: brooklyn 

92.64 104.68 A: in brooklyn oh i live in virginia [laughter] [laughter] isn't that interesting they just kinda connect you with anybody [laughter] [laughter] that's kinda cool how did you hear about this 

95.22 98.11 B: yeah [laughter] cool [laughter] 

99.72 101.23 B: yeah [laughter] 

103.11 104.32 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

104.37 109.43 B: [lipsmack] um my sister found out about it somehow she told me 

107.57 116.76 A: really yeah i found out over the internet i do a lot of survey and and secret shopper and stuff like that 'cause i stay home with my kids 

113.05 113.96 B: yeah 

117.01 118.69 B: oh good for you [laughter] 

118.01 121.01 A: yeah it's not easy it isn't easy 

121.21 122.55 A: but um 

122.75 133.73 A: you know that's another thing with with a partner you know you you've gotta come into agreement on certain issues and you know if you're not in agreement one of you's gotta be willing to give [sigh] 

133.94 138.28 A: so there's been times where we've [sigh] felt like um 

134.23 135.21 B: (( mm mm )) 

139.34 140.39 A: (( [lipsmack] you know )) 

140.30 146.89 A: the best thing is maybe to go back to work and then we'll turn around and say no and [sigh] you've gotta weigh everything and you know 

146.77 156.48 A: one of the biggest things that comes out is finances and and the two things that will separate a couple is is money or trust so there's that trust word again 

155.12 156.06 B: (( oh )) 

156.28 157.43 B: yeah 

156.79 170.22 A: so um you know i i deal with a i'm actually a um [lipsmack] christian counselor and i deal with a lot of married couple- couples on the rocks or people who are getting ready to get married and and things like that and um 

169.50 170.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

170.36 171.68 A: they just 

171.80 173.91 A: i don't know they they seem to 

174.41 187.67 A: [mn] k- kids nowadays when i say kids i know you're eighteen but you're you're there right on adulthood [sigh] so um but kids kids nowadays tend to go into relationships and not even think about what is really before them in the future 

177.71 178.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

187.92 199.41 A: [sigh] so hopefully hopefully this conversation will open some eyes for you [laughter] you know a lot of kids are making a lot of mistakes out there and you know it's it's sad 

188.82 189.94 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

193.87 194.97 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

196.73 197.56 B: yeah 

199.56 200.84 A: but um 

202.00 203.36 A: i don't know it's 

203.78 217.93 A: i give me a viewpoint from from the younger generation now since i'm considered middle middle age almost [laughter] give me a viewpoint from your standing on how kids feel about relationships 

211.50 212.22 B: [laughter] 

218.24 225.21 B: well i don't know it's it's i mean there's all like i think there's all different kinds there's some that just 

225.06 233.53 B: really wanna get on with life and will take anybody that they can have fun with and there's some that [sigh] just wanna keep away keep to themselves you know 

233.07 234.27 A: mhm 

233.64 236.73 B: there's not i don't think there's one you know 

236.95 242.55 B: universal way that people kids think but [sigh] it's mostly different you know so 

241.30 245.93 A: [noise] [noise] yeah and and what's your viewpoint on it 

245.96 250.37 B: i don't know uh i won't take it too fast take my time [laughter] 

248.83 249.79 A: yeah 

250.00 256.17 A: well that's good that's good one of the biggest things i've learned about relationships is don't go on emotion 

256.27 266.16 A: um we're built in a way that it seems like whenever we feel we've found the right partner we let our emotions go wild rather than thinking rationally 

261.68 262.24 B: (( mm )) 

263.85 264.48 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

266.12 267.11 B: yeah 

266.49 276.32 A: and that's one of my biggest advice to you is you know when you do find that person don't run on emotion run with a um a rational thinking 

276.30 277.68 A: that uh 

277.57 285.13 A: okay this person may be for me but do i know everything about him and [sigh] you know it takes a lifetime to get to know somebody 

284.89 298.62 A: i've been married fifteen years and i'm still finding things out so [laughter] [laughter] that's that's a scary thought but you know if you don't keep your communication open and and you have new ideas and new things every day that pop up um 

287.42 288.33 B: [laughter] 

298.52 300.13 A: that challenge you 

299.80 301.14 B: [noise] 

300.39 301.73 A: and uh 

301.74 302.65 A: but 

302.87 316.80 A: i mean that's good that your perspective is that you're not gonna rush it i hope that's your true perspective [laughter] some people will say that when they find out they're talking to an adult adult [laughter] but you know well i'm gonna say what's right here um 

307.65 308.74 B: yes 

309.24 310.40 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

316.88 324.08 A: but you know a lot of kids i commend you for that and i commend you for the fact that you know that you have [mn] 

324.29 328.87 A: pretty solid sounds like you got pretty solid ideas of what a life partner should be 

328.96 343.62 A: um i commend you for that and you know just keep standing strong and 'cause it's hard nowadays a lot of people out there especially you know for a female 'cause the male is the dominant species in the aspect not that they're better than us 

335.99 336.58 B: (( yeah )) 

343.57 351.68 A: but that they're pushier [laughter] you know [laughter] they can push you and they can work your emotions and they can work it for you um 

345.13 345.84 B: [laughter] 

351.83 358.10 A: [lipsmack] work for or against you on depending on what they want because the male is built um 

358.26 359.64 A: that they are 

360.00 373.94 A: they're action built you know action speaks louder than words where with women words speak louder than actions [sigh] so yeah that's another key point for you to keep in mind when you're looking for a partner um 

374.21 376.46 A: (( what do you [mn] are you working )) 

376.22 378.02 B: [lipsmack] no school 

377.78 381.72 A: you're in school oh okay have you graduated from high school or 

378.68 379.62 B: yeah 

381.40 382.81 B: (( no not yet )) 

382.27 384.33 A: so [mn] you're graduating this year 

384.14 385.22 B: yeah 

384.66 387.20 A: (( all right is everything going okay there )) 

387.06 389.13 B: yeah pretty much [laughter] 

388.13 390.93 A: good good glad to hear it 

391.06 392.11 A: so 

392.52 402.43 A: but man no ten minutes can be long [laughter] [laughter] i thought this would be easy [laughter] [sigh] 

394.83 395.39 B: (( mm )) 

395.52 396.78 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

399.27 403.93 B: [laughter] yeah you know how hard can it be to talk 

403.26 415.91 A: i know well it's difficult when you don't know the other person [laughter] but anyway well i've dominated most of the conversation is there anything you wanna say [laughter] 

406.33 407.28 B: [laughter] 

408.23 409.04 B: [laughter] 

413.96 418.17 B: [laughter] i don't know you seem to be doing a pretty good job [laughter] 

416.97 422.57 A: [laughter] you're saying as long as i get paid my ten bucks right [laughter] 

420.36 422.92 B: [laughter] oh yeah 

422.58 425.60 A: [laughter] oh lordy 

426.26 427.14 B: [laughter] 

426.49 435.06 A: gee whiz oh i know how that feels like i said i stay home with my kids so i'm i look for all different things to do to make money and stuff but [noise] 

428.92 430.04 B: [laughter] 

435.48 440.21 A: oh [sigh] well let's see the question is what do we look for in a life partner 

440.93 442.02 A: um 

443.53 446.12 A: [sigh] so have you dated anybody 

445.89 446.83 B: (( no no )) 

446.52 447.46 A: no 

447.65 448.48 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

447.86 457.67 A: you know what i didn't date my first guy [laughter] this this is really funny i didn't date my first guy until i was a senior in high school and i was engaged as a senior in high school 

457.90 461.06 A: i was engaged for three years then the guy dumped me 

461.03 462.32 A: and um 

461.63 462.52 B: oh 

462.29 469.40 A: but that's okay 'cause the guy i married now [laughter] was my second date [laughter] [laughter] and if you wanna call i mean 

469.23 478.02 A: if you put 'em in technical terms of dating as actually going out and you know being together with nobody else the i've only had two dates in my entire life 

478.07 478.81 B: oh 

478.07 488.65 A: and my second one turned out to be my life partner and although there's been bumps in the road my marriage has been a lot better off than i'd say a good eighty five percent of the people i i know 

488.77 489.92 B: (( that's yeah hm )) 

489.30 498.75 A: you know i've got i've got thr- three brothers and one sister and my sister and i are the only ones who have never divorced and remarried um 

490.05 491.32 B: yeah 

498.92 502.95 A: you know so obviously they didn't choose too well for their [laughter] life partners 

503.00 513.35 A: you know they all they're all my brothers' wives cheated on 'em [laughter] so i don't know what's going on there [laughter] but [laughter] two of 'em are cops so i guess that's why they're never home 

513.42 514.93 A: [sigh] but um 

514.73 517.17 B: what th- they're not normal hours 

515.50 521.03 A: yeah no they they work shift work so they're hardly ever home 

521.07 530.40 A: and um you know especially when you're i mean they've been on the force for years so um you know the the wives that they're married to now 

530.27 541.47 A: actually one just got divorced so he's not married now but the other one that he's with now understood all of that and she's stuck with him but his first wife left him and um so 

541.79 545.65 A: th- all three of my brothers have been divorced and remarried at least once 

545.74 546.47 B: mm 

545.90 556.57 A: [laughter] so i'm like okay but um actually the one that just just divorced um that was his second marriage so he has divorced twice 

556.77 559.45 A: so it'll be interesting to see how that goes on 

559.42 560.07 B: (( hm )) 

560.16 570.58 A: but yeah i've well my husband and i another good key point is when you get married or before you get married both of you need to make a p- [sigh] you know when you make a promise to somebody you 

570.70 576.65 A: there's a promise you know you're gonna keep and then there's a promise where inside you're like well i might renege on this 

576.49 577.58 B: yeah 

576.95 582.51 A: you need to you need to make a promise to each other that you know you will keep that divorce is not an option 

582.74 596.62 A: the only way a divorce is an option is if he beats you or there's a danger involved or say d- you find out he's a drug addict and he won't change other than that divorce really is not an option huh 

597.25 598.60 A: [laughter] 

597.38 599.89 B: like if if if you just really don't think
