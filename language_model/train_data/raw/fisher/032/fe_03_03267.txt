11.04 14.81 B: yes um what would you like to say about that 

14.24 18.84 A: well i guess first of all i guess it would be someone that 

19.15 20.68 A: (( of good character )) 

21.00 22.48 B: mhm 

21.73 26.83 A: and that's trust- trustworthy and when i say character i guess from the standpoint of 

26.88 29.14 A: not that they're perfect but ah 

29.58 31.83 A: (( they have i guess )) 

31.84 32.83 A: no 

33.23 35.72 A: (( ah legal baggage huh )) 

36.56 37.41 A: um 

36.60 41.42 B: yeah i i'd find that important too somebody who has good character and trustworthy

65.63 69.23 B: will be there for the long run and always be there 

69.68 75.04 B: and [mn] yeah i think that's the same thing you said i find those things important also 

76.30 77.31 B: um 

80.12 81.32 B: (( [sigh] let's see )) 

80.22 84.67 A: i guess the other aspect i guess i would look for other quality would be um 

86.31 87.33 A: that they 

87.53 90.12 A: they can maintain a 

91.19 96.75 A: [mn] i guess relationship and when i say that i guess in the standpoint of not ah 

97.68 100.22 A: bringing third parties thing in 

100.37 103.98 A: you know the relationship would be between the two of us and not the mother 

104.59 106.37 A: or the brother sister [mn] 

107.40 109.42 A: that affects ah 

109.72 111.81 A: you know how we relate to each other 

111.71 115.83 B: [noise] oh yeah yeah that's true yeah 

114.66 123.36 A: because when you get when i tend to see you bring a third party in the third party don't know what the two of you all share because they were on the outside and they's looking in 

123.43 126.64 B: yeah yeah that's true yeah 

125.95 131.19 A: and they tend to r- a third party tend to rush the judgment or they they tend to 

131.34 132.87 A: (( be biased [mn] )) 

133.32 135.85 B: yeah yeah that's true 

137.87 138.46 B: (( oh )) 

139.58 141.72 A: so how do you feel about that ah joanne 

141.14 145.05 B: [sigh] yeah i i agree with that also charles 

142.40 143.13 A: (( about uh )) 

145.65 146.40 B: um 

147.42 148.25 B: yeah 

149.42 150.23 B: (( um )) 

150.41 153.07 A: what what what state are you in ah 

152.37 154.72 B: i'm in california what state are you in 

154.43 155.95 A: i'm in georgia 

155.80 157.20 B: oh you're in georgia 

156.77 158.21 A: yeah 

157.69 158.44 B: oh 

158.57 159.31 B: yeah 

160.63 161.42 B: oh 

160.89 162.01 A: (( and i know )) 

162.04 165.76 A: laws huh in california that say um 

166.42 169.61 A: [lipsmack] ah what do you call the state of investment terminology now 

169.84 170.98 A: um 

171.41 174.93 A: when they sort of split assets fifty fifty [laughter] 

176.25 180.89 B: oh yeah yeah [mn] i heard that also about the community 

179.99 184.26 A: yeah community estate that's it like that the word you brought it right to mind joanne 

184.38 185.16 B: yeah 

184.64 185.96 A: and um 

187.37 191.84 B: yeah california is supposed to be a community state i mean in the case of ah 

191.96 194.96 B: marriage or divorces or both i guess 

195.29 197.10 B: yeah 

196.41 205.36 A: what seemed to be ah right and just for them does that mean they each brought some to to a relationship but they decided to have dissolve it right 

205.07 205.99 B: (( um )) 

206.07 214.55 B: yeah i think so but what if ah only one person brought something to the relationship what if both persons did not bring something to the relationship 

210.75 212.77 A: [laughter] 

214.19 222.21 A: i don't know it seems uh to that me that that quality that you know that the things that we just those that we just listed those are 

223.12 225.81 A: in a lot of cases they are somewhat 

226.19 233.97 A: relative right when somebody say trust ah ah they find that could it be 'cause 

234.51 238.39 A: ah [mn] your person the person that you choose they may say well 

238.50 241.11 A: ah ah you could trust me to 

241.20 243.90 A: ah you know pay the bills on time right 

244.96 245.89 A: right 

245.77 247.15 B: yeah right 

246.74 248.00 A: but then 

248.46 254.39 A: but i don't trust you [laughter] to go out with with your friends right 

253.76 255.05 B: yeah right 

254.89 259.48 A: so what happened so that mean it was relative right 

255.06 255.95 B: right 

258.73 260.14 B: (( right yeah right [mn] )) 

259.63 262.26 A: it wasn't finite 

261.53 263.47 B: yeah right right 

262.58 264.81 A: so that means 

264.94 278.91 A: they've had to have brought something to a relationship when they got attracted to the person because they felt they had some some quality to pull them there besides their good looks right 'c- 'cause the good looks only last could last just for a minute right 

274.62 276.50 B: yeah right right 

278.31 279.81 B: right right 

278.84 280.65 A: because if something happens 

280.61 281.36 B: right 

280.73 287.28 A: someday to them there was an accident or something they got the beautiful face carved up or either they got the body 

287.67 292.39 A: beautiful figure messed up they could've put on weight right so that mean that person 

290.30 291.90 B: (( yeah right right right )) 

292.60 294.40 A: wouldn't be ah 

294.91 296.94 A: wouldn't be attracted to them anymore 

296.85 298.44 B: yeah that's right 

297.00 303.38 A: if that's all that really was holding their relationship tog- together was their physical you know attraction for each other 

303.15 305.54 B: yeah that's right that's right 

305.16 314.27 A: 'cause then [mn] another element j- ah joanne that i look for would be ah someone that would acc- would acceptability 

315.24 316.69 B: yeah right 

316.71 325.73 A: and when i say that i guess i mean that just like we just talking then about if something happens um you know you put on weight or you got ill 

322.08 323.10 B: (( right [mn] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

326.08 328.49 A: you know they should be able to accept you 

328.75 331.04 B: yeah that's right they should 

329.86 334.47 A: and right accept you and then reject the illness right 

331.53 332.29 B: yeah 

333.86 335.20 B: yeah right 

335.72 345.12 A: ah reject ah whatever happened to you unless it's something terrible and bad that you went on to murder somebody and then somebody knew it but then 

345.12 356.15 A: you wouldn't know that unless f- you were there or somebody eye witnessed them right so then it would be a d- shadow of a doubt that they actually did this so that would mean you still need to be able to stick and stay with them 

349.44 351.22 B: (( yeah right sorry [mn] )) 

355.55 356.87 B: yeah right 

357.07 360.86 A: just like this peterson case we don't they don't really know 

357.38 358.47 B: (( right )) 

360.97 364.42 A: this guy really k- nobody saw him kill his wife right 

363.79 365.85 B: yeah right right 

365.13 369.50 A: okay it was circumstances that he was in the area fishing so 

369.86 374.96 A: that that's that was a kind of factor of what i'm saying you know you have to stick and say so 

375.03 382.78 A: ah with with your partner um give you know you know come what may unless it's something that you witnessed 

382.09 383.26 B: yeah right 

383.89 384.69 B: right 

386.97 387.99 B: (( [sigh] )) 

387.10 393.05 A: so are you ah up for ah getting a getting a life partner or you already chose your life partner 

393.21 400.64 B: i'm up for getting a life partner or at least i think i'm up for it no i haven't already chosen my life partner yet [laughter]
