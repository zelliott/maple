152.91 154.47 A: when uh 

156.31 158.58 A: well i guess we better talk about our husbands 

158.03 160.11 B: that's right 

158.64 164.03 A: husbands husbands oh we could talk [laughter] my husband's a truck driver 

160.91 162.25 B: [laughter] 

165.05 167.38 A: and he has a 

167.47 168.60 A: morning 

168.62 169.41 A: to 

169.45 173.92 A: afternoon job every day he's home with me 

173.51 174.89 B: oh that's nice 

174.55 180.34 A: in our earlier years he was on the road [noise] and that's very hard when he's gone for a week 

178.58 180.44 B: yeah i can imagine 

180.44 187.14 A: for four days at a time and that's very hard to deal with does your husband come home every night 

187.07 201.94 B: no he doesn't he [laughter] well we're in the stages right now he just finished medical school and so he's um he's in his doing his internship and so it's really hard sometimes because he um a lot of times has to stay 

194.95 197.63 A: [noise] [noise] 

202.00 205.71 B: in the hospital all night and things like that so 

204.68 209.50 A: uh-huh so he may as well be in timbuktu as far as you're concerned 

205.72 207.18 B: that's difficult 

208.54 218.73 B: yeah well some day when he finally finishes all of his training he might have a normal schedule where i can see him every afternoon but it's getting better medical school was really hard 

210.90 212.82 A: (( huh [laughter] )) 

218.30 224.57 A: [noise] i bet a lot of study time a lot of time he has to be leave me alone huh [laughter] 

223.57 235.85 B: yeah well a lot of times if he needed to study he would just um either stay at work or i mean stay at you know stay at school or whatever and during that time we didn't have the baby yet and so 

231.38 232.93 A: yeah [noise] 

235.92 241.05 B: um i also worked and so he even if he got home from classes early he'd be at home 

241.13 244.18 B: uh studying while i was still at work so 

244.19 247.00 A: you two are just pulling through it together aren't you 

244.56 246.14 B: it wasn't too bad 

246.18 249.43 B: [laughter] yeah 

249.60 254.85 B: well i think that's very valid that you said same religion so you guys are both of the same 

255.09 261.21 B: religious beliefs and so are my husband and i and we have a very good relationship i think that's 

256.16 257.25 A: yes 

261.55 262.73 B: very important 

261.91 263.30 A: (( you know )) 

263.59 267.80 A: together and under god that's first [laughter] 

265.87 270.55 B: mhm yeah well i think that also goes along with having the same goals 

270.10 271.04 A: (( uh-huh )) 

270.62 275.57 B: because if you have the same religious background then you probably you know have a lot of the same 

275.61 278.36 B: larger life goals which would you know 

277.60 279.11 A: yeah [noise] 

278.49 280.78 B: raising a family and you know 

281.39 284.08 B: kind of your plans for 

285.06 298.02 B: you know what you want to achieve and and i don't know i think that's probably one of the most important things i think if you're both are willing to put in you know a hundred percent on both sides then you know anyone can 

298.24 299.94 B: have a successful 

300.03 309.90 B: marriage if you if you're both willing to give you know i think people have the wrong idea if they say well you give fifty percent and i'll give fifty percent and that's a hundred and so we should be okay 

308.76 320.80 A: i i can affirm that that doesn't work [laughter] [laughter] oh dear sometimes one has to give a hundred and fifty too [laughter] 

310.11 313.55 B: you just both gotta give a hundred percent and then it'll work 

318.59 321.37 B: that's right that's true that's very true 

321.31 334.06 A: until the other one [noise] wakes up [laughter] or grows up [laughter] oh dear it seems like well we were married young as you can figure that out [noise] 

323.32 325.30 B: [laughter] 

334.97 337.79 A: and [noise] there was times in our early marriage where 

338.02 341.07 A: i had to wait on him [noise] to grow up [laughter] 

340.02 347.40 B: [laughter] people always ask me when are you guys gonna have kids and i said as soon as i finish raising my husband [laughter] 

346.72 350.51 A: exactly and that's exactly right 

350.92 354.39 A: because we didn't [noise] we had one right away 

353.90 355.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

354.98 359.85 A: and so we were going from apartment to apartment and we were saving money to get a house 

359.87 368.78 A: and he goes and takes our savings and buys a motorcycle so you know i had to wait for him to grow up [laughter] again [laughter] 

363.41 365.05 B: oh no you 

367.39 370.27 B: know that was the same thing my husband likes um 

369.99 371.20 A: [laughter] 

370.14 374.09 B: he likes stereo equipment and he i remember one time coming home and he says 

373.91 380.20 B: i hope you don't mind i he had this sub woofer that he had built himself you know it was pretty inexpensive and he 

379.96 391.25 B: blew it out when the lady upstairs he knew she was gone so he thought he'd crank it up real loud and here how it sounded and he blew it up and so he feels really sad and he went shopping and he bought himself a new sub woofer 

391.28 401.24 B: and i think it was probably like eight hundred dollars or something and i just came home from work and i said honey what are you doing [laughter] yes but 

397.95 403.13 A: (( [laughter] god yes [laughter] )) 

401.24 411.81 B: yeah sometimes [laughter] you know i just i think that's true you're just gotta let 'em have their little vices and just understand about it and then just let 'em have it 

403.15 404.63 A: [laughter] 

408.77 410.06 A: oh 

411.71 413.09 A: [laughter] 

411.78 416.53 B: and they eventually come to and realize what they're doing but [laughter] 

415.40 422.10 A: yeah 'cause it probably set us back you know saving eight hundred dollars when you're first married is not very easy to do 

419.86 421.86 B: [laughter] 

422.32 435.16 A: that was our down payment for a house [laughter] but eventually we did get there no doubt [laughter] it just took us a while longer [laughter] 

425.32 426.96 B: oh my gosh 

430.82 432.45 B: [laughter] 

434.99 438.77 B: well it sounds like you've made it uh made it pretty well anyway 

438.13 439.56 A: (( yes )) 

439.61 441.32 B: so that's great 

442.56 454.07 A: so let's see they didn't give us five choices my last phone call they gave us five different things to talk about this is kind of tough just just your husband for ten minutes [laughter] 

447.89 449.21 B: oh really 

453.05 457.37 B: well let's see what other good qualities sense of humor is definitely good 

457.49 458.40 B: um 

457.62 461.15 A: yes oh yes definitely 

459.72 464.40 B: because you have to be able to laugh at the stupid things that you do or uh 

464.75 472.40 B: i don't know i can't say i'd say patience is good but i i have to say i'm the more patient out of the two of us 

467.56 468.84 A: uh-huh 

472.03 474.60 A: yes my husband's a great teaser 

474.33 475.84 B: [laughter] 

475.89 482.84 A: and the the thing about that is our kids are all teasers and our grandkids are all teasers 

480.18 490.30 B: yeah you know what that's i i can tell my daughter already is going to be that way because you know my husband is the one who y- you go into the checkout line and he's joking with the 

490.19 496.31 B: you know the guy who's packing out your order and you know just always making jokes and talking to people 

490.79 492.77 A: yeah talks to everybody 

495.00 497.00 A: right never knew a stranger 

497.06 499.22 B: exactly exactly 

497.09 498.89 A: talks to everybody 

499.67 502.53 A: definitely sounds like you got the same kind of man i do 

502.18 504.19 B: [laughter] 

503.04 505.99 A: [laughter] 

505.06 506.54 B: oh that's funny 

506.17 510.67 A: but um i was always shy and i think opposites attract in that way 

510.64 511.60 B: uh-huh 

511.20 514.02 A: he was outgoing and that attracted me 

515.08 516.91 A: were you kind of shy 

516.51 524.48 B: i was i i was shy in some ways but i think a lot of people took that to mean or took my shyness as a 

524.56 525.76 B: maybe a little 

525.91 540.71 B: uh snootiness or something because i i'm always the one who if i see someone i know i kind of wait for them to say hi to me just in case they don't remember who i am or in case they don't really want to say hi and i think a lot of people growing up i found out later that 

535.75 538.85 A: [laughter] 

540.75 546.18 B: even though it was my own shyness they thought i was just being snooty or something like that 

545.50 547.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh misunderstood )) 

547.50 549.33 B: yeah misunderstood 

548.99 550.58 A: [laughter] 

549.70 554.17 B: but i don't i don't think my husband thought i was really shy when he met me 

553.15 555.12 A: [laughter] 

554.20 555.27 B: he just 

555.61 556.72 A: oh 

556.99 560.30 B: although i'd i have to say he's he's a little more 

560.34 563.52 B: easy to you know just talk to whoever 

560.60 564.53 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

563.66 566.44 B: uh that i am so 

564.70 566.24 A: [laughter] 

567.26 569.55 A: oh so do you um 

571.01 574.48 A: do you get along as far as do you both not smoke or you 

574.62 588.54 B: yeah we don't neither well that's also kind of part i guess the religious convictions but neither of us smoke or drink and that that helps out a lot because i think there's a lot of friction in families where you know you've got one person who 

578.96 579.91 A: yeah 

580.83 582.21 A: that's sounds that 

583.53 584.61 A: can be it's 

588.52 599.89 B: you know does that especially it seems like it takes up so much money and you know money can be another big you know argumentative factor if someone smoked or drink it just eats up so much money 

590.24 592.32 A: major [laughter]
