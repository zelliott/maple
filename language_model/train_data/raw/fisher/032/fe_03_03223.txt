209.55 210.63 A: [laughter] 

215.04 228.79 B: ah first she was you know disappeared for like under under the bed for like two days and finally she came out [sigh] and she just talks all the time in a loud [noise] loud voice and i work at home i'm a freelance writer i do my interviews on the phone and what not [sigh] and she'll walk in and she'll start with this this 

218.32 219.23 A: uh-huh 

228.58 229.41 A: [laughter] 

228.65 242.20 B: loud voice i don't what she's saying i don't know what it means [sigh] you know i i always make sure that exactly exactly but she's older so she doesn't like to play she you know she she's a pretty fat cat too she's like nineteen pounds yeah she's a fat cat 

232.95 235.71 A: i want attention that's what it means [laughter] 

240.35 242.37 A: (( oh my gosh that's pretty big [laughter] )) 

242.17 248.68 B: so you know i do my best you know and she she likes to be brushed but um [lipsmack] i it's so frustrating because she just comes out meow meow meow meow 

248.67 251.04 B: (( you know like this and she's so loud )) 

250.84 260.02 B: [lipsmack] but ah so i'm here all day most of the time but um i get to the point where if i'm going out she thinks i won't be back until [sigh] a long time and so she wants to eat all kinds of 

257.99 259.21 A: right right 

259.90 265.94 B: you know s- strange times and [sigh] [mn] but you know it's a it's a pretty easy life i mean my daughter loves to tell the 

265.71 278.62 B: you know the the shelter that you know this cat went from [sigh] a cage in yonkers to live in fifth avenue to to a fifth avenue [laughter] [laughter] and so it's cute [sigh] and ah i have we just spent the weekend in connecticut with um 

272.77 275.14 A: [laughter] that's great 

279.00 287.49 B: [lipsmack] an an ex girlfriend of my sweetheart [sigh] who has i think eleven cats it's unbelievable the time she has to s- spend just you know cat boxes and 

282.53 284.82 A: (( oh my gosh that's a lot of cats oh )) 

286.93 288.46 A: oh i know 

287.50 299.33 B: buying the food and fixing it and w- washing the dishes and -d combing their hair and [sigh] and she's lucky she has a big back yard and all that but still whoa so ah o- one cat's pretty easy i have say [laughter] 

298.21 300.05 A: that's good is it an indoor cat o- 

299.54 310.09 B: yeah oh yeah yeah it's ah completely indoors and so [sigh] um i've most apartment cats i'm told they think when you go when you leave in the day they think you're going out in the hall [mn] and that you stand out in the hall all day 

309.68 310.98 A: (( o- o- oh [laughter] )) 

310.16 319.42 B: so it's taken about like six or seven years before she finally got to the interest the courage or whatever to when i open the door wants to you know pop out [sigh] so [sigh] she has walked up and down the corridor 

319.02 320.04 A: [laughter] 

319.41 328.84 B: ah but then the elevator arrived just as she was you know so she ran d- dashed back in and but she's getting pr- getting pretty brave now [sigh] ah the one thing i haven't had to do is actually be [sigh] 

329.10 339.05 B: around when a pet has died but both times i wasn't with either c- cat and i've never had to make [sigh] what they call final arrangements whatever so i'm you know i don't want to think [sigh] negatively but i just know 

339.02 348.35 B: jeez no i'm not going to escape it this time [laughter] it's a horrible thing to think about exactly like oh gosh so i i'm trying to you know 

341.18 345.40 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] i know i know that's just the hard thing i know it 

348.36 354.39 B: trying to not [sigh] be negative but try to think ahead of time w- what i should do and how i should do it and you know whatever 

350.70 351.50 A: (( [sigh] )) 

353.90 355.49 A: would you get another one 

355.28 364.07 B: [sigh] um i'd probably take a break f- for a while um only because it is it is a tremendous responsibility i mean you you know it's just it it um 

363.89 369.31 B: you know when you go away you have to make sure you have someone to come in and feed her and what not you know that well you have even more [sigh] 

365.30 368.46 A: yeah [noise] yes yes yeah 

369.22 379.98 B: so um i think i probably will take a a slight break um i'm you know i'm no spring chicken myself as they say i'm and i'm seventy although my mother who i'm going to visit in florida tomorrow [sigh] [mn] she's eighty eight so 

379.30 380.60 A: god bless her 

380.36 385.47 B: it's she still gets two year magazine subscriptions so i guess i shouldn't think so negatively but 

385.05 387.16 A: (( [laughter] )) 

385.28 386.40 B: you know [mn] 

386.25 400.82 B: i just hit the big six oh and so um that's sort of thing makes you feel like hm that's such a big number it's such a horrible number to me then but you know i have friends who's a a friend who's also turning sixty and she said [lipsmack] she said now karen when i go in a store and i buy a jacket i think well this is probably the 

400.71 407.86 B: l- last jacket i'll need i say oh my god [laughter] real horrible [laughter] 

402.70 412.07 A: [laughter] oh no that's horrible [laughter] i sell magazine subscriptions and it's so funny 'cause i tell 'em well um as long as you have a subscription girl going you will live 

408.24 409.00 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

411.49 413.97 B: [laughter] that's good 

412.66 420.10 A: [laughter] because they all say oh at my age i don't renew subscription sub- subscriptions and i'm like [noise] yeah but this'll ensure your lo- longevity 

415.58 418.16 B: [laughter] 

419.39 422.50 B: (( exactly it's a small price to pay [laughter] [lipsmack] o- o- o- )) 

420.45 423.17 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

423.20 435.77 A: well that's um [sigh] yeah it it is hard my sister has um [noise] four four cats and [noise] and two dogs and then one cat passed away and it it was her first one you know that um and so that was really hard too [noise] but um 

432.74 433.95 B: (( oh )) 

435.76 440.14 A: but i've had other animals pass away b- before and it it's it is very hard 

439.49 440.81 B: yeah it is yes 

440.33 443.16 A: and like you say no more no more you know but 

442.40 444.62 B: [laughter] exactly 

443.80 447.22 A: (( [laughter] but it's hard i i mean e- )) 

445.13 445.69 B: (( mm )) 

447.26 451.34 A: especially if you've been an animal person your whole life it it's hard not to 

451.35 461.03 A: h- have an animal like you say it's hard to go away when you have an animal that's one of the thing i have a problem with [sigh] but um one is not bad in fact one is not bad at all [noise] 

454.22 455.58 B: it is it is 

459.97 470.59 B: no no and my my daughter w- she lives in the city as well so she um she comes up and feeds her when i'm away and that's fine while we're away so there's no problem like when i'm going away to follow my my

470.52 483.47 B: boyfriend's not coming with me so he'll he'll take care of her [sigh] um so it's you know it's a pretty easy going and s- she's used to being alone a lot they say you should have two cats but i don't think she'd be happy with another one she's r- really set in her ways [laughter] 

472.77 473.76 A: (( right [mn] ))
