14.60 23.72 B: [sigh] well i i i've done this a couple of times before um what we're supposed to talk about the the topic that they asked us to talk about for the next ten minutes 

23.21 24.44 A: oh okay 

24.28 31.34 B: and i think the topic they told me was ah choosing a life partner and what kind of things are important in doing that 

28.25 29.18 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

32.08 35.88 B: so ah what kind of things are are you married

38.44 40.81 B: ah well this is good timing then 

40.92 45.61 B: so wh- what do you think is important in looking for your mate 

44.99 46.71 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

47.68 49.30 A: well i think 

49.54 54.77 A: i mean the obvious things would be a common interest and that sort of stuff but i think really the most important thing is 

55.20 56.54 A: um 

57.00 59.81 A: c- like compatible um 

60.83 68.96 A: attitudes sort of compatible personalities everything else you know liking the same movies all that kind of stuff um 

63.42 64.32 B: uh-huh 

70.27 74.49 A: can be worked around i think but you need to be able to ah 

75.89 79.34 A: put up with the other person's personality [laughter] otherwise forget it 

78.23 79.50 B: i guess so 

81.06 82.64 B: yeah maybe ah 

82.85 92.18 B: common goals i think might be important um i've been married before i'm i'm i'm married now and i've been divorced twice 

85.00 86.33 A: yeah 

92.47 93.66 B: so ah 

93.30 95.82 A: i guess you're more of an expert on this than i am [laughter] 

95.00 105.35 B: well [laughter] no i don't think [laughter] maybe not exp- an expert but i've had some ah experiences i guess [laughter] [sigh] um 

105.47 110.70 B: you know my my [mn] first wife was um 

110.79 123.62 B: different than me i my our cultural differences were quite a bit different you know i i grew up in the southwest and she grew up in new york city and ah she's of italian she was of italian descent and ah 

118.36 119.42 A: oh okay 

123.50 129.88 B: you know i was just a normal [sigh] guy [mn] and ah some of our differen- you know 

129.89 144.08 B: when i we first met ah actually the fir- we didn't get married for quite a while ah maybe several years yeah but it was all the differences that were seemed to be exciting to me and i i liked all of our differences 

144.37 147.37 B: but [mn] because it was so interesting 

147.48 153.04 B: but after a while the differences were the things that were making the difficulties 

153.12 154.41 B: and ah 

153.47 154.70 A: right 

154.47 161.40 B: so i- i'm i- i'm thinking now um at you know different stages i'm alm- i'm almost fifty years old now 

161.55 166.99 B: i'm forty nine and i'm thinking my current thoughts on the matter is that 

167.29 176.67 B: when you're young you know in your twenties and thirties after your first marriage that and you're thinking about building something by by building something i mean building a 

176.80 179.42 B: a um a family or 

178.76 180.01 A: mhm 

179.43 192.43 B: building a house or building a thing i think the differences are really good because you have different ways of looking at things and you have different you know ways of look but i think that as you get older it seems 

188.09 189.36 A: right 

192.75 195.50 B: being the same is much easier [laughter] 

195.10 203.49 A: yes i i agree um [lipsmack] i well i'm gay and i've been dating my boyfriend for about two and a half years now 

203.21 204.29 B: (( mhm )) 

203.63 212.71 A: and um i've never i've never dated anyone that was younger than me it just coincidentally i always dated someone that was at least a year or two older than me 

209.05 209.90 B: (( mhm )) 

212.71 219.30 A: ah but my boyfriend is actually six years younger than me and um 

216.62 217.55 B: uh-huh 

220.13 230.45 A: i didn't really think it would be a problem i did because it it never felt like a problem in in i never when we were first dating i never stopped and thought well you know he's just immature or this or that it just 

230.62 235.57 A: felt like it was just a biological fact and not a real factor in our relationship 

235.18 236.28 B: yeah 

235.62 237.02 A: um 

237.04 239.50 A: but you know [mn] over the years i've 

239.83 246.80 A: i mean that's something that we definitely have to work at because um [lipsmack] not so much that i feel more mature than him but there 

246.88 251.02 A: you know for talking about an issue or politics or the arts or something 

251.21 257.59 A: you know there's just things he was not really aware or or you know 

251.68 252.87 B: right 

258.19 260.59 A: grown up enough during things like the 

260.66 263.25 A: iran contra and and you know 

263.71 273.67 A: the hostages and challenger and it's just cultural events that he wasn't really aware of that helped shape you know who we are and things like that um 

272.16 273.45 B: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

274.37 278.70 A: you know i find that i i'm thirty one and i find that he has 

278.97 289.54 A: a certain optimism that at first seemed nice you know and refreshing but now sometimes it feels a little tedious you know like oh come on you know 

287.07 288.05 B: yeah 

289.31 291.81 B: so [mn] now how long have you been around him now 

292.16 293.78 A: i'm sorry how long have you 

292.93 294.36 B: have you been with him 

293.86 295.39 A: ah two and a half years 

295.05 296.41 B: two and a half years 

296.43 298.95 B: and you said he's like what five years younger 

298.79 301.30 A: ah five and a half six [sigh] 

300.38 302.27 B: five and half yeah so that's 

302.90 304.10 B: that's 

304.11 305.16 B: that's 

305.12 313.25 B: certainly an issue i mean d- do you think that if you met him five years later let's say five years from now you met him and you were 

313.03 323.09 B: you know the same age do you think that those differences would still be there i'm i'm wondering if you can pin it down to really differences in maturity or just really basic differences in the way that you are 

322.67 327.56 A: well i think and most people agree that that the age difference is more 

327.63 332.01 A: of an issue the younger you are obviously someone who's forty and someone who's forty six 

332.07 334.53 A: the age difference is not really going to matter 

333.35 335.37 B: right that's right 

334.74 339.50 A: but when you're dealing with someone that's twenty four and someone that's thirty 

339.03 341.63 B: that's right the big difference 

339.77 340.89 A: um 

340.99 351.42 A: there's just things and it obviously it hasn't been such a big issue that it's caused us to break up it's that i would say probably that's the biggest issue that we deal with in our relationship it's just 

351.52 352.72 A: um 

353.44 354.55 B: (( [lipsmack] well )) 

353.87 356.81 A: his his perspective being much more 

357.44 360.02 A: idealistic and and you know 

360.12 362.96 B: [sigh] yeah well one thing is you know 

360.34 361.78 A: (( optimistic )) 

363.10 364.59 B: i'm thinking over 

365.28 375.03 B: [sigh] you know over a period of time by short period long period and short period medium period long period wh- when y- when they say what are you looking for in a life partner 

374.95 381.12 B: you know when you meet someone in the very first three or four years of a relationship 

381.19 393.53 B: i think that some things are important and then in the medium years you know the say the five to ten year range different things are important and in the long term you know like fifteen years or or more yeah the different things are important 

393.02 394.26 A: definitely 

394.28 397.09 B: and it's kinda like 

397.41 398.81 B: um 

398.93 408.62 B: you know i i'm going through this see i'm right in the [mn] i'm thinking actually [lipsmack] i'm in the process of um having some real difficulties with my wife now i've been married for 

408.78 410.72 B: i don't know eleven ten years now 

411.22 419.13 B: and the same thing is she and i are completely different and i found those differences really exciting ten years ago and and 

419.28 433.63 B: you know we built a lot of stuff together you know she and i have been building these things but a you know a house a family and and we've got quite a number of um of a [noise] quite a large estate but i'm at this point now that 

433.87 437.72 B: th- the things she does are so much different than mine 

437.82 444.97 B: it's almost like i'm willing to throw it all away and now i really wanna find someone who's really just like me [laughter] very similar to me 

442.67 443.81 A: (( mhm mm )) 

444.32 445.59 A: (( well [mn] )) 

445.80 454.67 A: the the question itself had me thinking you know what do you what do you look for in a life partner and i've always thought and i don't have as much perspective on this as you do but 

454.68 459.23 A: maybe that's a flawed ah thesis maybe 

459.24 464.62 A: we're not maybe some people maybe all people are not supposed to have a life partner maybe 

464.65 473.94 A: you know the idea of being with someone i mean obviously we're not the same person that we are when we're twenty that we are when we're forty or sixty and maybe we're not supposed to be with 

472.19 472.75 B: (( [sigh] )) 

474.04 479.02 A: a single life partner from age twenty two to seventy or whatever 

475.24 476.14 B: (( that's a )) 

478.15 489.78 B: that's a very interesting idea because ah my my wife has told me that before you know she said you know i think that ah she said you know i think that you get tired of you know my first wife i was married to 

490.22 497.84 B: oh let's say seven years and the second one like maybe three and now this one i've been married to ah ten 

498.21 511.31 B: and you know it's kinda like it's just nothing is of interest anymore and and you know maybe maybe that is it maybe maybe the better question is what are you interested in for your 

511.27 515.31 B: your partner for the next ten years or the next fifteen years or whatever 

513.92 516.03 A: mhm 

515.47 517.97 B: and just the whole id- the h- concept of our 

518.06 524.29 B: our um the basic concept that people think that oh you should get married for life is is a 

524.36 526.28 B: n- not a you know 

525.82 528.13 A: it's a flawed kind of thing 

527.53 533.10 B: yeah now i'm sure that a lot of a lot of religious people would really find that [laughter] 

528.22 529.00 A: (( yeah )) 

532.33 535.57 A: well i think it depends on the person i think some people [mn] 

536.51 542.50 A: want that and and are suited for one person for life and other people um 

542.62 547.19 A: are not i used to think that i wasn't i used to think that i would just 

543.39 544.58 B: yeah 

547.41 548.66 A: um 

549.28 550.17 A: you know 

550.37 551.58 A: date 

551.64 558.46 A: [laughter] for life or whate- what have you or have a number have maybe five or six long term relationships over the course of my life 

553.07 554.94 B: yeah right 

558.04 568.69 B: well like with this fella you're with now are y- are you thinking about um [sigh] when you say [mn] when i mean you're not thinking about marrying him are you or or financially [mn] 

567.48 570.98 A: well i am i mean more and more the longer we're together i think about 

571.03 575.55 A: settling down but i am sort of objective enough to know that's 

575.95 590.92 A: because i'm i'm you know in in the midst of a relationship you know if i wasn't i mean like i said i used to think that i would never s- you know sort of settle down and now i feel like i want to um we're talking about moving in in together and stuff like that 

587.49 588.39 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

591.05 592.77 A: so um 

593.02 599.89 A: yeah it's hard to say i mean i know i keep thinking well what about you know eight years down the road
