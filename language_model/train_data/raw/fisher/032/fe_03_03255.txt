0.67 1.76 A: hello 

1.43 4.49 B: hi my name is juanita how are you 

4.35 14.24 A: i'm fine thank you my name is sarah [laughter] i am new to this um [noise] system i don't you know i haven't ever done this before so [laughter] 

6.26 7.43 B: hi sarah 

13.28 18.08 B: okay well basically the topic today is um what do we both look for in a life partner 

18.18 21.46 A: okay um do you want to start then or [laughter] 

19.06 19.95 B: and 

20.80 22.75 B: well for me i'm a christian 

22.51 23.39 A: uh-huh 

22.76 24.06 B: and um 

24.31 27.43 B: i'd prefer a man that loved the lord 

27.72 32.11 B: how much he goes to church is not that important to me 

31.92 32.76 A: mhm 

32.07 42.87 B: but mostly important that he will love my three kids just as they were his own um and be spiritually led because most men that are spiritually led they have morals they are less likely to cheat 

36.23 37.23 A: mhm 

42.70 43.64 A: mhm 

42.96 44.16 B: or to 

44.50 46.34 B: lie or to 

46.53 55.68 B: you know just be out of character treat you bad and that's what i've found from my walk with god so that's what i truly desire is a man that will love me like god loves the church 

49.40 50.29 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

55.44 56.47 A: mhm 

55.73 57.25 B: and that is seeking 

57.53 60.07 B: you know a lifetime commitment you know 

59.86 60.73 A: right 

60.06 65.16 B: that's very you know where no matter how bad it gets he's not going anywhere 

65.06 71.08 B: no matter how bad it gets when i say bad i don't mean like an abusive relationship like verbally or physically 

70.93 80.33 B: those are things you know you have to get help or you just have to walk away but i mean when finances hit because a lot of couples they break up because things are bad 

79.34 80.76 A: mhm right 

80.47 83.10 B: people always do that it's like if it's bad 

83.18 87.64 B: you know they just walk out you know if finances are rough you know 

88.23 90.34 B: some people use that as an excuse to cheat 

90.21 91.05 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

90.35 91.45 B: um 

91.60 98.81 B: for me personally i just i want someone who has as much love in their hearts as i have to give and you know it's equal 

99.07 101.56 A: right i agree there 

100.81 103.33 B: [laughter] so what's 

101.51 111.31 A: [laughter] when i was i was when i see i'm married right now when i was looking you know i wouldn't even say i was looking for a husband he just kind of found me but 

111.20 124.30 A: when we started dating you know i knew that i was looking for someone i knew would be a good dad you know without really even thinking about it i knew that i wanted to have children and i knew that i wanted him to be able to take care of my kids though 

124.29 130.99 A: and it's one of the things i notice about my husband right off and that you know i agree about being a christian i'm a christian myself 

130.84 139.95 A: and my husband is a christian also so that you know had to be compatible with my belief and you're right i don't think that it's important as much about how to 

139.88 146.20 A: how often he goes to church but how he believes in god and and carries that on and how he acts every day 

146.33 159.81 A: and you know i really think that i found the right man with my husband i agree that it seems like you need someone that will be able to get through all the problems and the hard times my husband and i have gone through a lot of hard times because 

159.91 163.87 A: we've had some problems medical problems with our children 

163.71 177.35 A: and a lot of families split up over that i mean finance too we've had difficulties with [laughter] we've kinda been here with the book and a lot of times he tells me that his faith is what has gotten him through some of those hard times when he thought 

177.38 180.38 A: you know maybe it would just be easier to quit and get a divorce 

180.39 191.01 A: but for whatever reason you know his faith really carried him through and his um faith gave him more of a conscience than some other men might have had so i agree with that i think it's important too 

191.09 200.86 A: that you know the men and women will have some of the same um likes and dislikes but it's also important that they have their own lives outside of the marriage too probably 

200.93 212.89 A: so that you know they can still be able to go out and do other things with other people and [laughter] get away from each other a little bit i guess but you know it's important to be able to go out and do things together as a couple though too it's 

208.26 209.00 B: (( yes )) 

212.82 219.78 A: something my husband and i have a little bit of trouble doing right now though um it would be nice if we could have some more help doing it 

219.61 228.75 B: oh me i'm a single mum so i i i i i'm envious [laughter] because doing it as a single mum is even harder because there is no breaks 

223.90 225.07 A: yeah 

229.27 230.56 A: yeah 

229.63 234.12 B: and um i do it solely as an entrepreneur from home and um 

234.89 241.50 B: i constantly am praying to god to send me that man that will love me like he loves the church that will 

241.95 245.61 B: support me and my children and i'm not talking about just financial i mean 

245.54 247.13 B: emotionally 

246.70 247.93 A: mhm 

247.00 253.01 B: i mean come in and that's the hard thing i know i'm asking a lot from god right now because a man to come in and take on 

252.85 265.85 B: you know a seven month old a five year old and a four year old and just all of a sudden take on the screaming and the hollering and god forbid if he has no children or only has one you know because most guys they if they come to you the children are usually with the mother 

255.98 256.95 A: mhm 

265.67 267.35 A: mhm right 

266.01 271.03 B: so that's like the hardest part for me but i just keep the faith that it can happen 

271.13 274.46 B: that it will happen um when i don't know 

274.60 286.06 B: um but i keep an open mind about it because it's almost like a plague you know you never know when they're gonna find a cure for the disease you've just gotta hold on and i never know when mr right is gonna knock at my door 

285.99 297.21 B: and say those are my kids this is our family and when you need a break i'll help you and when i need a break he'll help me and when we need childcare we'll look for it together because even being married to their dad 

292.51 293.63 A: mhm 

297.16 303.15 B: it was always me if we he if we wanted to go out i still had to find the childcare if i wanted to go out with him 

303.05 304.34 A: yeah 

303.27 314.79 B: and i used to think that was so unfair because they're our kids and we're trying to get time together but that was his way of you now getting out and being by his self and cheating which is one reason we're not together 

314.82 326.03 B: so from him i learned a lot about what my ideal mate is you know as far as someone that's honest i want to be able to trust my man no matter where he goes if he's in a room with five hundred beautiful women 

318.20 319.58 A: mhm 

325.99 333.21 B: i want to be able to just say i'll talk to you later honey or i'll see you soon and know that he's he's it's me 

330.29 331.38 A: mhm 

333.26 334.21 A: right 

333.46 342.05 B: and today with the way the world is and people looking at so much t._v. and so much divorces [mn] everybody's definition of an ideal man is 

342.08 344.42 B: can you last the year longer you know 

344.35 345.73 A: yeah 

344.80 348.90 B: because every body's getting divorced i mean really fast and 

349.00 356.21 A: yeah they think that's the cure all for the problem in the marriage is just get out of it [laughter] 

349.02 350.12 B: nobody 

355.39 357.78 B: yeah and nobody you know nobody's 

358.28 364.23 B: nobody's holding on it's like okay you know what he's gaining too much she's gaining too much weight i'm gonna move on 

358.41 359.24 A: yeah 

364.05 365.39 A: mhm 

364.75 369.30 B: and the stupid reason used to be the toothpaste the wrong way they wanted a divorce 

369.19 380.16 B: you know or you've got one person that doesn't think the same way about finances as you do or budgets and you know and everybody didn't every time you turn around the woman's left with the kids anyway 

380.35 382.07 B: but that's the thing i don't mind 

380.43 385.83 A: right you're right about the either that or they think that if there's something wrong 

385.90 387.65 A: after a couple of years they think 

387.92 394.79 A: that they should get whatever they need from someone else even though they're still married you know and then they go cheat on you you know [laughter] 

393.90 400.44 B: but the thing of it is people don't realize and i guess that's why i haven't been in a relationship in a year and a half is because i won't settle anymore 

400.23 401.22 A: mhm 

400.51 404.54 B: and by not settling i've decided one important thing 

405.11 407.95 B: and that's i will not settle period 

407.97 409.80 B: and if 

408.14 408.97 A: (( mhm )) 

410.13 413.44 B: the person if i compromise you're settling 

413.38 414.68 A: mhm 

413.98 415.57 B: if you 

416.31 420.98 B: if you see some things that are doing that remind you of previous relationships run 

421.19 422.58 A: (( yeah )) 

421.78 434.58 B: you know there's always those telltale signs you know and fortunately for you i mean fortunate for you you you know found that mate that's been there and people have got to realize the hardest thing to do sarah is start over 

434.35 435.77 A: mhm 

435.08 442.00 B: starting over is the hardest thing to do in this world because now when a new male walks into my life guess what 

441.87 442.94 A: mhm 

441.87 448.49 B: we got to learn each other's likes and dislikes and what we like about each other what we don't like about each other 

448.29 462.65 B: and how to fit the kids in how to do this and it's the starting over point and some people have don't have a problem starting all over because some people meet today and they're married tomorrow i don't want that i used to be that type of person but not anymore i want a man that wants to take it really slow 

460.06 461.01 A: mhm 

463.16 469.11 B: come in you know be a friend and i've been dating someone like that for three years off and on 

465.53 466.71 A: mhm 

468.97 470.02 A: (( mhm )) 

469.21 470.45 B: and um 

470.89 473.81 B: he just continues to tell me god is in control you know 

473.62 482.19 B: take it slow and now he's gonna be stationed closer we don't know what's gonna happen i'm not predicting 'cause normally women we we we read so much into stuff 

481.97 492.13 B: then we end up getting hurt and we try to blame another person it's really not their fault it's our fault for reading too much into it so i take it with a grain of salt okay he's coming and 

485.72 486.89 A: mhm 

487.85 488.91 A: mhm 

492.21 494.46 B: we'll let time see what happens 

494.43 495.87 A: mhm 

494.85 500.11 B: you know and whether he pursues me because i'm not gonna chase a man that part i won't do 

499.96 501.14 A: right 

500.37 506.45 B: i will not the bible tells us we're not supposed to chase men even though today's modern woman thinks that it's okay to 

506.71 515.82 B: you know if you see a man tell him you like him ask him ask him to marry you well i'm from the old school i believe a man should knock on your door ask you to eat i believe he should be the one to propose 

515.68 516.78 A: mhm 

516.02 517.69 B: that's how it's always been 

517.97 521.98 B: you know how'd your husband propose to you and how did you know he was your life partner 

518.14 519.01 A: (( yeah uh )) 

522.35 533.22 A: well he actually proposed to me while i was really sick [laughter] yeah i was really sick um one day with um 

527.65 529.03 B: are you serious 

533.59 539.06 A: i think it was a urinary tract infection and to tell you the truth it was really horrible i was throwing up and everything 

539.16 550.82 A: [laughter] so he doesn't have a very good sense of romance [laughter] he um had just off the phone talking to his mum and i guess she had said to him on the phone 

550.88 560.50 A: something to the effect of we're making plans for something in the summer and we kinda need to know what your plans are with sarah if you they're kinda 

560.88 562.98 A: saying if you get our hint you know 

563.20 572.68 A: um so they wanted to kinda know if he was planning on asking me to marry him and he got off of the phone with her and he said to me he turns around and says 

572.99 577.94 A: what his mum said to him and then he goes well i guess i could just ask you now [laughter] 

576.66 580.47 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

579.66 586.36 A: so i was really sick and then a couple of days later we went out and picked out a ring and everything after i'd gotten better but 

586.33 595.24 A: no he wasn't very romantic about it but you know we had both kinda hinting about it for a couple of months before he actually did propose 

595.27 599.95 A: and a lot of people would probably have been you know thinking that we had got together too fast
