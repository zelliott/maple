89.14 90.65 A: [laughter] 

91.35 93.61 B: i just kinda look at things a little 

93.81 97.07 B: a little off skew for everybody else i guess 

95.26 96.39 A: yeah 

96.56 101.43 A: oh off skew's really good we like the far side a lot so i'm [laughter] 

99.84 102.07 B: yeah that's that's me 

101.69 103.62 A: we're into off skew here 

103.28 104.70 B: (( mhm mhm [laughter] )) 

104.16 108.40 A: well with me religion's a big part of it um 

108.31 121.55 A: you know my husband wasn't a christian when we got married but he is now but if i was oh god please no i never want to be out there again but [laughter] if i was it would have to be someone that was a christian and have the same morals and values that i did 

113.88 114.82 B: mhm 

121.81 128.24 A: and um but then you know personality's a really big part of it i really don't care about looks 

128.23 131.47 B: right you have to kind of give that up because 

128.83 129.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

131.31 139.66 A: exactly those go away i mean you know you get you get older and your boobs sag [laughter] and you know if they're they're 

134.13 135.05 B: (( i know )) 

137.41 138.46 B: yeah 

138.64 142.73 B: everything that was tight gets loose [laughter] 

140.73 149.06 A: right [laughter] exactly so you know personality and like you said someone who came me laugh and smile i think is really important 

149.31 154.83 B: yeah i kinda think it's kinda hard for me now because i am getting older and 

154.28 155.16 A: yeah 

155.23 157.61 B: you know i can't compete with 

158.03 160.45 B: the mid- the bare midriffs and the 

160.26 161.58 A: oh exactly 

161.09 162.17 B: the uh 

162.75 165.13 B: the butt crack showing i 

163.99 168.38 A: [laughter] oh no way [laughter] can't wear those 

166.68 169.07 B: wouldn't want to do that anyway but 

168.87 170.28 A: [laughter] 

169.11 170.01 B: um 

170.64 173.51 B: i just can't compete with that right there so 

173.28 179.48 A: oh i know and you know what's so frustrating to me is that you look at these these guys um i mean my mum is um 

179.65 189.84 A: fifty eight and she's single but she wants to be but what frustrates me is that she looks at guys her age and they're all going for girls in like their forties early forties 

186.21 187.31 B: (( mhm )) 

189.08 190.30 B: mhm 

189.96 192.55 A: no-one wants to look at someone their own age 

191.72 193.31 B: their own age 

192.78 202.43 A: so if you were looking at someone like around my age i mean if you were looking at the guy who was forty he's gonna be looking at a girl that's twenty and like you said i can't compete with that 

199.43 200.57 B: mhm 

201.75 204.24 B: mhm and i don't want to 

204.03 205.16 A: no i don't 

204.25 205.10 B: and then 

205.47 209.79 B: they get it and they realize after she's taken all their money or 

209.21 210.07 A: [laughter] 

210.10 217.07 B: half killed 'em that they should have just went on went with someone their own age but by that time they realize it 

211.50 212.38 A: right 

217.74 219.97 B: we don't want them by then 

218.84 226.53 A: exactly [laughter] well there's a maturity issue too because i mean what is a forty year old really going to have in common with a twenty year old 

221.87 222.98 B: mhm 

226.00 227.15 B: nothing 

226.94 228.56 A: you know i mean 

228.63 236.86 A: when they talk about music or i mean you know their idea of music is um justine timberlake and things like that so they're not going to have anything in common 

235.55 236.13 B: (( [mn] )) 

236.64 237.67 B: right 

237.72 241.71 A: but [mn] i don't know i i just think it's really hard 

242.77 245.26 A: especially with everything that's out there today 

245.10 245.97 B: i know 

245.77 255.04 A: it's like when i first got married i mean we didn't go to the doctor and say okay i need to be tested to make sure i'm h- h._i._v. positive make sure i don't have hepatitis b. or c. 

251.88 253.07 B: mhm 

254.44 255.38 B: mhm 

255.12 257.89 A: you know and today i mean you've got to do that that's just 

258.26 259.27 B: yeah 

259.11 260.45 A: that's scary 

261.78 263.18 A: (( so i don't know yeah so )) 

263.01 264.84 B: (( that's kinda of crazy )) 

265.96 268.10 B: it really is crazy 

268.37 272.50 A: yeah so i'm glad i don't have to look for one but you know um 

271.83 275.70 B: i you know i've kinda given up on that i'm just not even 

275.38 276.39 A: (( have you )) 

276.13 277.75 B: no i'm not looking 

277.54 279.63 A: you figure if it happens it happens 

277.84 278.87 B: (( if it )) 

278.89 283.17 B: happens it happens if it doesn't it'll just it'll be okay 

282.91 285.31 A: yeah yeah that's that's kind of the 

284.67 289.21 B: i i was trying for a while you know i was trying really hard to try to 

289.75 297.58 B: make something into what i was looking for you know make someone into what i was looking for and then it just 

293.26 294.09 A: (( uh-huh it )) 

297.83 300.63 B: you know i just said i'm not doing that anymore 

300.34 301.45 A: didn't work out 

301.45 302.20 B: (( uh-uh )) 

302.52 311.26 B: because they just along with it to make you happy but if it's not wholehearted it's gets on your nerves because it's just by rote 

311.14 316.03 A: yeah right well i think part of the thing is too is people don't change 

316.45 317.32 A: um 

316.57 317.53 B: mhm 

317.43 318.91 A: you know i mean 

319.45 321.69 B: only can change if they want to 

321.23 332.59 A: yeah exactly and you know i mean i admit that my husband is not perfect and i'm not perfect either even though i don't admit that very much [laughter] but we've changed no i don't tell people that 

327.76 328.92 B: [laughter] 

329.13 331.11 B: 'course you don't tell people that 

332.46 336.64 A: um but we've changed because we wanted to ourselves 

336.41 337.38 B: (( mhm )) 

336.79 339.09 A: not because he wanted me to change or 

339.31 343.33 A: and um i just think it's amazing today that so many people um 

343.62 344.60 A: i mean 

344.91 350.77 A: it's it's i don't know i mean marriage has just changed and finding someone so much has just changed just like 

350.72 364.99 A: you know you see people divorced three four five six seven times and uh it's like they're not willing to work really i mean there's very definitely reasons to get divorced obviously i mean my mum had a great reason 

353.45 354.26 B: (( uh-huh )) 

361.97 363.10 B: (( mhm )) 

365.06 368.01 A: and um he's just a total jerk 

367.45 368.42 B: mhm 

368.08 369.72 A: um my dad was but 

369.76 377.34 A: you know people are not willing to fight hard and um and compromise they just i want it my way and no other way so 

377.98 381.70 B: yeah that's that's what happened with us i i 

381.86 384.18 B: one of us was willing to fight 

384.32 385.30 A: yeah 

385.08 388.92 B: and i'm not gonna say it was me because it wasn't 

387.32 389.11 A: [laughter] 

389.06 391.89 B: but you can only fight by yourself so long 

391.31 392.69 A: oh exactly 

392.47 394.19 B: until it gets old 

393.63 395.05 A: exactly 

395.80 398.70 A: so so you've said you've done this a bunch of times
