163.38 165.21 B: (( do mhm [laughter] right )) 

165.94 174.47 A: but it's a fun game you know it's just just to where we can spend time together and then sometimes we just take off and go for a drive and you know 

174.67 179.80 A: no certain destination but we're together and yeah so 

179.18 181.11 B: we like to go hiking

205.35 215.23 B: mhm yeah i think it's important that you have the same religion you know because when you don't go to church together and 'cause there was a lot of years when he didn't want to go to church and 

208.26 209.32 A: (( mhm )) 

214.02 215.00 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

215.54 219.10 B: and that was it just wasn't the same you know and i was lonely 

219.24 224.71 B: and wanted him to go with me and now he does and it's it's a special time you know 

222.33 223.14 A: yeah 

223.83 228.09 A: it fills that emptiness that that was there yeah 

225.62 226.53 B: yeah 

227.38 231.33 B: and it makes it a christian family it makes it more 

229.28 230.87 A: mhm yeah 

231.41 236.61 A: it builds a strong relationship i think when you know you can do that together and 

236.77 241.23 A: 'cause little things you do together also helps to build a strong relationship 

241.36 242.43 B: mhm 

242.89 245.66 A: and do you guys have any pets at all 

246.06 247.13 B: any pets

275.17 289.45 B: no we not unless like if we're at a wedding or something and slow dancing but he's he's not one for you know up beat dancing [laughter] he's self conscious i think 'cause he doesn't know how or whatever but we used to we used to do bingoing 

278.27 279.90 A: mhm yeah 

281.71 282.85 A: yeah 

288.84 289.78 A: mhm 

289.36 293.11 B: used to do that and bike riding sometimes 

293.41 294.28 B: (( um i )) 

295.20 298.33 B: don't know just walking taking walks together 

296.54 298.12 A: yeah yeah 

298.88 305.23 A: that's a good time to talk you know and catch up on on each other's lives what goes on during their day you know and 

304.03 304.80 B: mhm 

305.13 315.00 A: if you work and they're away and he works and he's away and then you can just take a slow leisurely walk in the evenings or something you know and discuss the days events and 

315.38 316.27 B: sure 

315.39 318.59 A: we we do that once in a while 

317.07 318.05 B: (( we sit )) 

318.77 321.75 B: we sit on the bench swing together and talk 

320.49 322.32 A: mhm yeah 

322.85 323.77 A: yeah 

323.85 326.84 A: yeah yeah it's kinda nice to do that

337.04 338.16 B: [laughter] 

337.71 338.65 A: (( so yeah but )) 

340.48 351.01 A: i think uh building a lifelong relationship you know is a full time process you start it from day one of your marriage and it's the constant work i mean it 

351.04 353.05 A: takes two and it's uh 

353.17 356.21 A: a give give situation in my opinion 

356.22 356.93 B: hm 

356.25 361.10 A: you know you gotta give some you gotta take some he's gotta give some and he's gotta take some so 

361.96 366.87 A: but i think it's a lot it's uh um well rewarded 

366.88 368.87 A: event afterwards so 

369.72 374.81 B: gotta have a good friendship and your husband to be your best friend 

373.31 375.03 A: mhm right 

375.95 379.27 B: and you should want to spend time together and 

377.59 378.95 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

383.08 391.68 A: yeah i think the older that a person gets the more things that they find that they can do together you know that earlier years like 

391.69 399.86 A: just take me for instance in earlier marriage and stuff i didn't feel like i should go out fishing and stuff because i didn't feel it was the womanly thing to do 

399.95 403.44 A: you know even though we'd be together but now you know it's 

404.26 411.44 A: i'm out there with him and i'm i'm half way enjoying it and i don't dare tell him i like it [laughter] so 

409.19 410.50 B: [laughter] 

413.44 415.17 A: do you garden at all 

415.50 417.39 B: what's that 

416.12 417.54 A: do you have a garden 

417.76 422.80 B: no not really there isn't a good place in my yard to really put one [laughter] 

418.60 419.33 A: no 

421.31 422.18 A: mhm 

422.78 432.15 A: yeah our garden amounts to we work in it together so there we are again you know out there together we do the onions and the potatoes and 

432.30 439.90 A: some green beans and lettuce and peas and then i have lots of flowers like i said but he's not fond of the flowers 

441.27 443.59 B: yeah my husband does more of the 

443.67 456.30 B: just because i'm not really very good at it but that's one he's really good about is he's so helpful you know he did the bushes in the front yard and he put um like wood landscaping around it 

445.57 446.45 A: mhm
