60.95 65.15 B: no i'd like to have a dog but i lived in an apartment and i just don't feel it 

65.40 66.92 B: it's really fair to 

67.48 68.35 B: to do that 

68.53 69.59 A: to the d- to the dog 

68.69 69.50 B: eh i don't know 

70.20 70.56 B: hm 

70.78 72.41 A: i uh oh yeah i know what you mean 

72.59 74.05 A: like right now i have um 

74.24 74.72 A: a little 

74.90 75.85 A: tiny um 

76.11 78.25 A: poodle terrier whatever i think it's a poodle 

78.43 78.84 B: uh-huh 

78.63 79.87 A: it's a miniature poodle 

80.00 80.95 B: oh 

80.69 84.39 A: and that one is um not even ten pounds if that 

84.52 84.90 B: uh-huh 

84.99 86.64 A: and but i do have a big akita 

87.27 88.53 B: oh my gosh 

87.94 89.16 A: yeah so 

89.61 91.06 B: you have a cat 

91.38 93.33 B: a a poodle and an akita 

93.25 94.87 A: and an akita 

94.44 97.46 B: i don't think they'll get along 

95.97 98.90 A: believe it or not they do 

99.31 102.98 A: they get along just fine and i think it's because the poodle was here first 

103.31 103.81 B: uh-huh 

103.98 106.16 A: and it's an older poodle so it's about 

106.41 106.78 A: i would 

106.90 108.97 A: say in human years ten 

109.48 109.87 B: yeah 

109.63 111.05 A: very o- it's getting pretty old 

111.63 115.89 A: um then then it was followed by the akita now the akita's only uh it's still

141.51 150.00 A: i- i- i found it attacking my door it just wanted in you know and it and it attacked being a kitten and these two bigger dogs you know they just knew it i guess 

150.17 152.53 A: they knew instantly though there was a small 

152.84 155.28 A: baby kind of an animal and they they've been fine 

153.11 153.48 B: uh-huh
