200.02 200.95 A: (( uh-hum ))

571.62 572.58 A: (( oh [noise] uh-huh )) 

572.34 577.35 B: i was s- so scared the only way i the only reason why i found her was because 

577.40 579.32 B: [noise] we'd hear her meow 

579.56 589.68 B: and then we'd like we'd walk towards where we heard it and then she'd meow again and we'd get closer [laughter] like it took forever but i'm so glad we found her [noise] [sigh] because she does she was 

579.75 580.63 A: [laughter]
