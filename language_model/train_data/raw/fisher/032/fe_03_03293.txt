137.91 140.28 A: [laughter] i knew it was gonna be embarrassing 

140.54 143.55 B: and you're still young though you're not an old maid [laughter] 

142.64 144.66 A: i'm thirty four 

144.65 151.60 B: now you said some other characteristics in a a spouse that you would look for 

151.23 154.83 A: well i look for someone that has a stable job 

155.01 157.27 A: someone that um 

157.27 171.31 A: is employed most of the time you know because that's important i have friends that that um is going after a man that just do not have a job it's like from job to job 

159.90 161.94 B: mhm 

171.17 172.63 B: really 

171.70 182.85 A: and i just i don't like that i want someone that's gonna show me they're stable and that and someone like that is someone that should that you should choose 

182.94 188.69 B: yes someone who has some ambition and who loves life and wants to make the most of their lives 

188.67 190.30 A: exactly 

190.86 193.36 A: i think we're on the right page here 

192.93 199.61 B: [laughter] yeah i think there are many people out there who are just plain old lazy and that would be awful to have that in a spouse 

199.26 200.61 A: that's right 

201.51 202.61 B: so 

202.91 208.18 B: what do you think are the most en- enduring things that make a marriage work 

208.19 210.10 A: i'm sorry i didn't hear you 

209.88 213.30 B: what what characteristics should be 

214.19 218.45 B: in a person that would help make a marriage work forever 

217.96 228.39 A: well i think there should communication should be really the number one thing between two people because if you don't have that then your marriage is doomed 

228.54 233.44 B: and you have to care about the per- the other person as much as you care about yourself even more 

233.16 237.28 A: exactly and love another thing love is a choice 

237.35 243.99 A: uh it's not a feeling based on butterflies in your stomach it's like a decision because all of that goes away 

244.31 245.49 B: that's true 

246.38 255.51 B: and you have to be there for the person through thick and thin and when they're old and gray and [laughter] if you're just going after the external things it's not going to last 

255.67 257.30 A: exactly 

258.25 259.43 A: right 

258.94 263.26 B: what about common interests do you think that would be another key area 

263.23 272.44 A: yeah the yeah i would say but not as much my husband and i we do have things in common but then again we're like what you like what [laughter] 

273.72 276.40 B: (( well at least overall common values )) 

276.61 277.72 A: yes 

277.32 281.72 B: he might like golf and you might like tennis but at least you're both 

282.92 285.83 B: enjoying activities you know 

285.48 286.75 A: right 

286.84 295.27 A: and another thing we don't do this i wish we did exercise i've heard that if people like exercise together they stay together 

294.96 297.21 B: (( oh really i haven't )) 

295.76 299.72 A: i've heard that but it's like i can't get my husband out there 

299.32 300.77 B: [laughter] 

299.86 301.64 A: i would love to do that 

301.76 307.35 B: my husband exercises too much for my taste he's in very good shape actually 

303.99 305.89 A: oh really 

306.92 308.50 A: oh that's good 

308.08 312.03 B: so yeah very good very inspiring 

310.45 314.68 A: yeah so wouldn't you agree that some- that that's good too 

314.35 316.42 B: mhm 

314.82 317.16 A: but it i mean it's not as important though 

317.09 318.12 B: right 

318.57 320.00 B: and uh 

320.33 321.83 B: also liking 

322.04 323.59 B: (( you know sometimes to )) 

323.63 329.58 B: do things that are adventurous together traveling and cooking maybe cooking some 

326.38 327.73 A: yeah 

330.34 337.42 B: great dish that you saw on food network or something [laughter] just challenging yourself to do what you ordinarily wouldn't do 

333.31 334.76 A: yeah 

337.44 339.63 B: and doing it together makes it more fun 

339.26 342.82 A: yeah it adds a little spice to the marriage 

343.31 345.98 B: and how about liking to meet new people 

345.96 347.44 A: what was that 

347.58 353.13 B: liking to meet new people together meeting new couples and [noise] 

352.98 358.01 A: i think that's a good idea we we don't really do that but we probably should more 

357.68 360.78 B: mhm and uh 

361.60 372.30 B: i really like traveling with my husband i always have fun and learn new things about him we went on a safari to africa and learned that he was afraid of mice he wasn't afraid of the lions or the elephants [laughter] 

372.04 374.67 A: oh i think that's great 

375.34 376.56 B: and uh 

377.42 382.34 B: and and building on a relationship is the most important thing and all these things help that happen 

382.24 383.71 A: yeah 

384.78 390.29 B: now is it your first this is the first time that you've been in a long term relationship 

389.95 404.60 A: pretty much so i mean i had like a couple let's see i went out with someone for three years and then one for two years but i just knew that was that it wasn't going to work out because i was looking i mean i met him in a bar and 

400.50 401.26 B: (( i )) 

404.25 406.08 B: right [laughter] 

404.56 408.39 A: you know that's just not that's not the way to go 

408.20 410.09 B: (( mhm )) 

410.23 413.43 A: 'cause you'll never find someone like that in you know 

413.61 415.89 A: in a bar [laughter] 

413.97 417.62 B: (( and )) 

418.18 420.50 B: your your family do they like him 

420.45 421.95 A: oh yes 

422.00 423.42 A: they really do 

422.23 423.42 B: that helps 

424.08 425.29 A: they really do 

424.15 434.63 B: yeah 'cause that can make it really so difficult when family doesn't like the other person they're always picking on you and then you have fights with them and 

429.90 430.97 A: yeah 

432.57 434.89 A: yeah i i think you're right about that 

436.02 441.70 B: so many people have that sort of stuff going on and then kids can bring stress to a marriage 

441.85 444.78 A: yeah i we do not have any kids 

445.22 451.57 B: that's why you're still smiling no i'm kidding [laughter] [laughter] no kids are fun but they 

447.30 448.80 A: [laughter] 

450.86 452.49 A: how many do you have 

452.12 458.69 B: well i have three stepkids so that's a whole other ball game but it's really uh it's it's 

453.90 455.00 A: oh okay 

458.74 459.93 B: i think children 

459.97 467.48 B: while they are a great asset in terms of a relationship with another person it takes away time from that person and 

466.24 467.75 A: that's right 

467.76 471.87 B: we all need we all only have twenty four hours in a day [laughter] 

471.40 472.45 A: right 

471.98 472.78 B: (( so )) 

472.85 478.84 A: takes away time from that special time between you and your mate like you might be tired 

478.58 479.93 B: exactly 

479.24 480.23 A: and you won't 

480.77 482.98 A: yeah i can see how that would be a problem 

481.86 491.94 B: and everybody i hear that has kids they keep telling me about what they're going to do in twenty years once the kids are gone and i'd rather live life and do everything now [laughter] 

491.40 496.01 A: well that sounds that sounds like you've got a good head on your shoulders that sounds pretty good 

496.37 497.55 B: (( thanks )) 

496.74 498.03 A: yeah 

498.61 503.00 B: so if there was one thing you could change about your spouse what would it be 

503.10 513.97 A: well he procrastinates like i'll have a honey do list and i'll have to literally hound him did you do this did you do this and that drives me nuts and it drives him nuts 

514.68 520.49 B: yeah i could see that [laughter] especially if he doesn't it it would drive me nuts [laughter] 

516.69 517.76 A: yes 

519.11 523.10 A: [laughter] right [laughter] what about you 

523.16 536.87 B: uh i would say his worrying worrying about the future or something that might happen that really won't happen and just conjuring up all this stupid stuff in his head for no reason 

532.12 533.10 A: right 

536.61 537.59 A: right 

538.20 548.91 B: i'd rather him just relax and be positive and plan well and live life as though it was the most exciting thing on earth which it is [laughter] 

548.53 549.97 A: right 

548.67 553.47 B: (( and i think we all tend to forget in the day to day boring stuff )) 

553.39 554.59 A: yeah 

553.83 565.77 B: and plus seeing the events of the world around us but i also like somebody who can talk about those things i think that is something that i like about my marriage my husband loves to talk abut current events and 

564.37 567.74 A: yes mine too he's a big history buff 

567.39 568.55 B: oh is he 

567.95 570.65 A: and he always watches those world events 

571.13 573.83 B: that's good so he has a lot of uh 

574.57 575.47 B: interest 

575.27 582.69 A: yes and he was in the military and he's got all that yeah he was in the air force and 

579.07 581.59 B: uh but he's not 

582.08 584.22 B: wow did he fly a plane 

584.16 586.34 A: no i don't think he did 

586.86 590.59 B: oh okay well i guess you would know if he did right [laughter] 

589.14 595.69 A: yeah maybe i should ask him when he gets home tonight [laughter] [laughter] i don't think he did though 

591.64 592.81 B: yeah 

595.57 599.95 B: i'm just learning about see you didn't even know that so there's always something to learn
