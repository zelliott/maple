60.52 62.96 B: yeah we're about 

61.58 65.97 A: i guess you must have pretty good communication if you're engaged so 

65.17 68.21 B: yeah i think so i think so

99.23 100.57 A: right 

100.00 102.22 B: yeah 

101.55 103.94 A: [sigh] yeah i know how that can be 

103.57 105.15 B: yeah it's 

105.95 111.04 B: not [sigh] a good feeling when somebody you love is sick like that 

110.57 112.99 A: [lipsmack] yeah that's the truth 

112.38 113.70 B: yeah 

113.05 117.93 A: how long have you you said you had been and had been with your er fiancee for how long 

117.37 119.85 B: we've been together for five years 

119.22 121.89 A: oh okay that's a long time 

119.91 121.15 B: yeah 

121.29 123.22 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

122.42 126.21 A: yeah you ought you're probably i guess pretty sure [laughter] 

125.62 129.17 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] pretty much so 

126.74 127.50 A: (( huh )) 

129.44 132.07 A: yeah that's that's good 

130.06 131.33 B: yeah 

131.52 133.05 B: yeah 

132.38 137.51 A: well i'm not married now i was i'm divorced actually um 

137.85 144.03 A: but ah i i just think it's r- i think it's im- commun- communications is right up there with um 

146.82 155.92 A: with the tr- the ah tr- [lipsmack] honesty but th- the question was what quality and that's why i said that because 

153.18 154.05 B: uh-huh 

156.82 158.37 A: i think that um 

158.49 162.95 A: if a person is dishonest you can't trust them 

161.15 162.43 B: right 

162.99 172.62 A: then what they're communicating is is not doing a lot of good i mean communicating dishonesty and you know distrust what good is that 

166.24 168.28 B: (( right )) 

170.23 171.57 B: yeah 

172.04 177.06 B: yeah you're right you're right that does play an important part of it too trust 

176.41 178.51 A: oh yeah yeah i [noise] 

177.56 184.84 B: very important because once you lose that you have you have nothing really if you can't trust the person 

184.57 188.06 A: you really don't have much of a relationship without it 

186.63 190.24 B: y- yeah you're right 

188.91 203.34 A: yeah that's why i say that but i think you've gotta be able to communicate too you gotta be able to talk to each other and and let the other one know how you know let one person the one person has a let the other one know how she or he feels 

203.03 204.65 B: right 

203.87 208.80 A: in order to ah keep a relationship healthy and vital and all that so 

208.79 210.38 B: yeah 

209.12 212.01 A: yeah so have you been married before 

211.44 215.34 B: yes i have i got married when i was sixteen 

215.33 216.83 A: oh my goodness 

216.11 224.65 B: yeah yeah so [laughter] that's another reason why i'm just kinda like taking it real slow 'cause i made a lot of mistakes 'cause i was young 

224.98 227.03 B: you know when i got married 

226.50 227.52 A: (( mhm )) 

227.19 228.37 B: too young 

229.05 230.79 B: and 

229.73 232.77 A: so you wouldn't advise your girls to do that huh 

232.00 236.23 B: oh no i wouldn't advise any young girl to do that 

236.70 242.13 B: i mean i would think anyb- an- anybody and everybody should should wait 

242.19 243.87 B: until they are ready 

244.84 250.78 B: um yeah i made a lot of bad choices by doing it 

248.70 250.30 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

250.37 258.62 A: you can't undo what's been done but [sigh] you can certainly not go back and make the same mistakes in the future that's for sure 

257.49 260.35 B: (( right right you're right about that )) 

261.20 263.93 B: we learn from our mistakes don't we [sigh] 

263.35 267.24 A: oh yeah definitely i've made some too i don't i don't know 

267.28 269.53 A: of anybody who hasn't 

268.96 271.33 B: right nobody's perfect 

270.93 276.64 A: well one thing about making mistakes is that you always learn well you should learn from them anyway 

276.10 278.51 B: right right 

278.79 286.13 A: [lipsmack] that's what i try to do let each one be a lesson and hopefully it's not a one of those lessons that can't be reversed 

281.68 282.81 B: yeah 

285.66 294.55 B: right [laughter] you don't wanna go back and repeat the same lesson over and over again you wanna go you wanna go to a different state

394.71 405.40 B: doing yeah m- since we are divorced and we my kids are by my my my former husband he's remarried and ah he has two other kids now so 

405.34 414.17 B: my my kids kinda feel like sometimes they kinda feel left out because he doesn't spend a lot of time like with them when he like he used too you know 

414.27 416.40 B: and when they were the only two 

416.42 417.97 B: you know and 

417.32 418.56 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

418.04 422.09 B: they're kinda like dealing with it now you know he just had

426.15 427.17 A: (( mhm )) 

426.69 430.68 B: with his new wife and they're really dealing with it right now 

431.29 437.03 B: and actually my um my younger daughter she's she's starting to 

438.03 440.70 B: i guess she's trying to act out you know 

441.27 444.04 B: some things because she's upset with him 

444.25 448.17 B: because i she's been having a l- a little behavioral problems 

448.64 449.59 A: (( mm )) 

449.68 451.66 B: (( ah [sigh] [mn] )) 

451.91 457.37 B: going on uh right now you know just little minor things i think she's trying to get attention for 

457.96 465.66 B: just things out of the ordinary that she's not you know i'm i'm not accustomed for her doing because i know what kind of child she is 

465.87 468.47 B: you know and i know why she's doing it 

469.82 480.12 B: [lipsmack] yeah so i i'm trying to get them to know that you know he he has another life now but he is still your daddy you know we have to learn how to get along 

480.66 481.64 B: you know 

481.22 485.75 A: yeah yeah so they don't get to see him every week 

485.45 493.42 B: no it was they were going over there like every other weekend now they don't you know it's like they barely ever see him now 

493.72 498.20 A: well the other thing too is that you've got a the wife involved 

497.64 500.18 B: right and they don't like her [laughter] 

499.58 500.99 A: oh they don't [laughter] 

500.26 510.80 B: [laughter] no they don't so and and that's another thing i'm not gonna make them go anywhere that they don't feel comfortable you know and they not they don't feel comfortable around her 

508.21 509.04 A: right 

511.47 515.46 B: and that's a another thing to deal with the situation also is 

515.47 518.66 B: they really don't like her so i'm not gonna make them go 

519.64 520.63 B: yeah 

519.97 522.45 A: yeah i can understand that too 

522.01 523.25 B: yeah 

523.07 528.86 A: i think maybe in time that'll that'll all be taken care of you know they'll 

529.54 536.76 A: maybe things will change and they'll kinda come together i i i know i have a sister who's in a situation like that 

529.66 530.75 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

536.06 537.43 B: really 

536.75 544.81 A: yeah she's divorced and her ex-husband has remarried and it was kinda like that with [cough] with the 

540.98 542.02 B: yeah 

544.97 550.34 A: the father of her kids for a while but now they're they're all very close 

549.96 551.39 B: oh okay 

551.04 557.04 A: so a lot of times it just takes some time for them to kinda get adjusted to it and 

556.48 557.75 B: right 

557.12 558.85 A: all that [mn] 

558.90 560.15 B: yeah 

560.18 570.39 B: i guess so because i mean they've they've been the they've been married for about three years now and um but she's just had the baby you know so it's it's like [mn] 

570.38 581.63 B: for the first two years they were fine you know they still didn't like her but they tolerated her just to be around their dad but now the baby's here you know they feel a whole lot different you know 

572.88 573.67 A: mhm 

582.71 583.84 B: (( [sigh] so [sigh] )) 

583.07 588.12 A: but some of it is the fact that she's had this baby and it's not your baby 

587.44 590.37 B: right yeah i think so 

590.35 595.28 A: yeah and that's probably a lot of why they don't like her it's probably not just her 

594.99 596.30 B: right 

596.01 597.86 A: it's the situation 

597.78 599.17 B: yeah 

598.47 599.89 A: the circumstances
