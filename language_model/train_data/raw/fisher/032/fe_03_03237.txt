38.44 40.45 A: we can't 'plain about the uh 

40.56 44.10 A: lack of cool uh the lack of hot weather basically 

43.72 51.09 B: (( [noise] [mn] yep i don't have any pets uh-huh )) 

45.73 46.86 A: but um 

49.31 53.31 A: [noise] anyway i guess the topic tonight is pets 

52.92 53.75 B: (( oh yes oh )) 

53.74 54.72 A: um 

53.92 67.44 B: (( yeah )) 

55.27 57.73 A: [laughter] and neither do i um 

57.80 65.75 A: not directly i have pets indirectly um my dad has a dog and uh it's a full blooded chow 

66.22 67.39 A: and 

68.06 71.24 A: i used to have a uh full blooded doberman 

72.06 74.21 A: mhm and uh 

74.78 78.07 A: i used to have an iguana as well 

78.56 79.95 A: [noise] but um 

80.70 84.37 A: i haven't i haven't myself had a pet since 

84.45 86.46 A: oh about nineteen ninety nine 

86.60 87.69 A: but um 

87.84 91.59 B: (( uh-huh )) 

88.05 89.63 A: i do tend to 

89.84 91.77 A: lavish a lot of attention on my 

92.85 94.88 A: uh my dad's dog 

95.67 101.03 A: [noise] but other than that i i really don't have i guess you could say like i said a pet 

101.44 102.50 A: (( but um )) 

102.62 104.85 A: i do look forward to getting pets um 

105.38 108.32 A: right now i live in an apartment 

108.25 109.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

108.35 109.69 A: and um 

109.72 113.73 A: in the south they're kind of peaky about you know pets and 

114.08 115.26 A: um 

115.48 121.45 A: it's always like their size or their breed um some apartment complexes will let you have pets 

121.46 123.89 A: but the dog has to be under twenty pounds 

123.39 125.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

124.03 129.16 A: and it it's not too many dogs that are under twenty pounds of course unless you're starving it to death 

129.17 132.57 B: (( uh right )) 

129.40 134.23 A: and then um there are some apartments that only allow certain breeds of dogs 

133.46 136.50 B: (( mhm )) 

134.62 135.50 A: so 

135.79 146.27 A: it just kind of depends on where you live that down here as far as whether you can actually have a pet you know if you don't have a house with a yard but um 

136.46 168.48 B: (( mhm )) 

146.75 153.29 A: [noise] i don't want any pets right now 'cause i figure you know i'm a big dog person um i don't like cats 

153.82 155.05 A: and 

155.29 158.64 A: you know so i definitely want to have space for 

158.85 162.92 A: not only a indoor out uh indoor dog but outdoor as well 

163.53 164.73 A: (( but um [noise] )) 

166.89 168.53 A: other than that 

169.57 172.68 B: right [noise] stephanie can you talk a little a little louder 

171.87 173.91 A: [noise] [noise] am i talking too low 

174.17 175.60 B: that's better 

175.70 176.83 A: okay 

176.68 177.74 B: thank you 

177.77 179.13 A: no problem 

178.81 181.33 B: (( i don't hear very well )) 

180.58 182.42 A: oh okay okay [noise] 

182.49 184.07 B: (( um )) 

184.20 190.19 B: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] i think a lot of places are like that about you know pets in apartments )) 

190.14 201.24 B: (( i know here in new york city it's hard to get an apartment where you can have pets uh i live in an apartment too )) 

201.15 211.59 B: (( a lot of people in new york live in apartments a lot more than the average uh in uh the rest of the country )) 

211.71 217.09 B: so there's about oh there's probably a lot fewer pets here as a result 

219.06 222.02 A: bu- [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah i i was thinking um 

222.44 224.86 A: when i went down there um 

225.47 228.98 A: i don't recall seeing a lot of people walking pets 

229.36 239.01 A: um like here's it's a very common thing as a matter of fact um we're such fanatics down here that we actually build parks for pets 

238.91 241.11 B: oh yeah [noise] 

239.79 243.07 A: where yeah where people who have pets um 

243.43 255.05 A: can just go and walk their dogs you know um 'cause a lot of people are afraid of dogs or they don't want dogs around their kids so they build these parks just for dogs and cats um 

250.82 252.90 B: (( right )) 

255.08 258.69 A: i mean you know the only requirement is that the dog has to be on a leash 

258.50 278.26 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

258.70 268.87 A: um you know within certain areas of the park but there are open areas where you can go out and throw a frisbee or throw a ball to the dog and and have fun 

269.18 272.99 A: so yeah they actually build parks just for animals down here 

273.56 278.04 A: believe it or not and they they are very popular very busy 

278.40 281.28 A: um because it's i mean it's such a 

281.65 288.32 A: it's such a hassle um with other people with other people around because like i said some people are so 

288.41 303.30 A: um conscientious when it comes to dogs especially if a person has a certain breed of dog you know you're [noise] you're more likely to walk up to a person who has a say a poodle for a dog versus someone who has a a pit bull or a rottweiler for a dog 

293.60 294.63 B: (( [noise] right )) 

303.14 304.27 B: uh-huh 

303.37 306.72 A: and so you know y- when you go to these parks you see your 

306.54 309.76 A: dogs of all shapes and sizes and 

309.57 323.17 A: it's just you know everybody's there to to walk their animal or spend time with their animal and i mean you see people out there like these pets that are their kids and they they stay out there thirty minutes an hour or two and just um 

323.24 330.71 A: you know spend time with their pets i've i've never i mean even the times that i had pets i never really paid attention to 

330.85 332.00 A: um 

332.02 334.80 A: [lipsmack] how much time i actually spent with the pet 

335.13 336.31 A: um 

336.90 338.16 A: (( you know i n- i )) 

338.41 339.70 A: knew that 

340.86 351.57 A: you know i spent quality time with them but as far as like you know sitting there and say oh well i spent thirty minutes or an hour or anything like that i never kept up with it because you don't about it like that but 

352.02 353.39 B: (( [sigh] [mn] [noise] mhm [noise] well )) 

352.71 354.37 A: i know some people do [noise] 

354.50 356.21 B: when i had uh 

356.85 359.41 B: a poodle when i was a child 

359.59 364.34 B: i used to play with her all the time when i came home from school 

364.90 366.06 B: (( every day )) 

366.94 368.05 B: but now 

368.98 371.42 B: i don't think i would want a a 

371.62 378.27 B: pet so i guess it's different than you looking forward to having one because i just don't know how i would ever find the time 

379.54 382.61 B: i'm too busy basically for a pet 

382.85 383.79 A: yeah 

384.94 392.05 A: i just kind of i don't want one for right now uh you know busy working and busy with school and things like that so 

392.11 399.20 A: you know i figure once i have left you know a little bit more time and not only time but um space you know 

399.31 405.08 A: um i think it's i think it's definitely um which is probably why the pet parks are so popular 

405.19 407.49 A: because i mean nowadays a lot of people 

407.72 411.93 A: um especially in this economy they can't afford homes 

411.94 416.20 A: so a lot of people are living in apartments and um 

412.00 412.97 B: (( [noise] right )) 

416.21 421.63 A: you know tho- those parks are a godsend because it's very hard to um 

421.82 428.43 A: um matter of as a matter of fact the apartment complex i live in they do allow dogs but um 

428.78 430.53 A: it's not too much 

430.74 433.73 A: um space to run around with a pet 

433.77 435.05 B: (( right mm )) 

434.06 439.38 A: um so it tends to create a problem because i know we have one tenant over here where 

439.30 449.59 A: they pretty much got evicted because of their pets um they had two boxers and these were very ferocious dogs you know that you could tell these dogs had been trained to 

449.52 457.31 A: pretty much attack on command if needed and uh the thing the problem with the dogs were they would attack 

457.48 472.14 A: and [laughter] they pro- they probably not had been given the command to attack um i know that the dogs attacked some other guy's dog one time and um they went up to the dogs went up to somebody's child and things like that so 

472.29 477.93 A: the um apartment manager pretty much told them you know hey you get rid of the dogs or you have to move 

478.35 479.95 A: and 

480.84 484.17 A: [lipsmack] they moved i guess 'cause i haven't seen them 

485.16 487.56 B: (( mm mm i don't know why anybody would want to keep )) 

488.05 491.80 B: (( dogs like that that's just asking for trouble )) 

491.78 498.23 A: so [noise] [noise] and you know i mean the thing about it is that a lot of people don't realise that these dogs that people get 

498.37 503.43 A: they're not born with that type of disposition people train dogs to be like that 

503.00 504.17 B: (( i know it )) 

504.29 509.26 A: you know so you know like i said those dogs are trained to be mean dogs 

509.46 510.99 A: (( and um )) 

511.15 519.02 A: you know of course you know it's it's a certain like i said there's certain dogs you wouldn't even want in an apartment anyway some dogs just need the space to roam and to run 

519.49 524.91 A: and two i mean one boxer let alone two are not apartment dogs 

525.46 532.46 A: and i mean i p- i pretty much have a i have a pretty spacious apartment i know have over a thousand feet square feet here 

525.52 526.39 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

532.79 534.85 A: and all the apartments hm 

533.20 534.05 B: okay 

534.81 537.46 B: okay that's a pretty nice size 

537.02 544.66 A: yeah you know so all the apartments here are pretty spacious but i mean still that's not enough room for two boxers to run around 

545.43 546.61 A: and they were 

546.72 548.72 A: they were pretty big dogs they were 

548.84 553.07 A: i would say mm at least fifty pounds had to be 

553.85 556.28 A: but um like i said they 

556.65 560.18 A: they got in trouble about the dogs so they ended up moving and 

561.52 563.35 A: [noise] haven't seen them since 

565.33 570.10 B: [noise] hm i know when i lived in philadelphia there was one of these dog parks [noise] 

570.24 576.31 B: but the funny thing about it was that it was it was not created to be a dog park 

576.69 581.56 B: in fact it had signs on the fences around it saying no dogs 

581.96 584.07 A: (( [noise] okay [noise] )) 

582.50 586.69 B: but that's the only thing that it was used for was for people to bring 

587.19 592.49 B: their dogs there so even though the they kept the signs up saying no dogs it was 

592.86 595.42 B: essentially a dog park anyway 

596.10 597.16 A: hm 

596.50 599.89 B: because nobody would go there for any other reason other than
