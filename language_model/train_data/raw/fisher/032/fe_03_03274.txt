40.04 41.18 A: okay 

42.24 45.18 A: i met my life partner at my church 

44.91 46.64 B: wow how about that 

46.05 47.39 A: how exciting 

47.87 51.33 A: actually he was the pastor's son 

51.42 52.62 B: uh-huh 

52.36 54.18 A: and that's how i met him 

53.80 60.29 B: well good what do you think is important about um how to determine who's 

60.80 63.37 B: [mn] i i'm just not used to this ah 

63.75 65.91 B: language of life partner 

65.32 67.46 A: yes something new 

66.18 68.36 B: it's awkward to me 

67.70 68.75 A: yes 

69.31 75.69 A: um you know as a- as she gave the topic i my immediately res- 

75.79 78.31 A: immediate response was um 

78.50 80.29 A: to be a friend first 

80.00 81.03 B: uh-huh 

80.68 82.85 A: and we did not do that 

82.99 83.98 B: (( [noise] [sigh] )) 

83.84 90.09 A: and so with my life partner it's been a struggle a twenty eight year struggle 

89.96 90.91 B: uh-huh 

90.98 95.01 A: but um i think things would have been different 

95.23 98.11 A: had i looked for that first 

97.51 98.60 B: (( hm [lipsmack] )) 

99.27 100.26 A: i don't know 

99.37 102.75 B: my my first thought was compatibility is 

102.83 103.73 A: okay 

103.33 106.59 B: that the same thing as saying uh to be a friend first [sigh] 

105.93 108.66 A: [mn] well it and it could be 

109.36 111.11 A: i think more of the 

110.38 111.87 B: (( mhm )) 

111.13 112.44 A: i don't know [mn] 

112.76 117.50 A: not just do a a one on one immediately you know one on one date 

117.57 120.64 A: but more of a group setting and get to know 

121.78 123.11 A: the real him 

122.81 123.91 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

123.26 125.46 A: or the real partner i should say [mn] 

124.76 126.69 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

127.22 135.17 B: i uh i was friends with my wife before we [mn] [mn] started dating we were in a uh small group bible study together 

136.10 142.65 B: and uh we socialized together in uh group settings and the singles group 

142.92 148.80 B: so i i felt like i did have a a good friendship with her before we ever decided to start dating 

149.17 149.73 B: (( [mn] )) 

150.05 157.37 A: okay yeah i had a different experience and and b- i think because of that not looking for 

158.18 159.19 A: um 

159.58 161.37 A: a friend first 

161.65 168.81 A: looking maybe even looking for a husband first and not looking for that friend first it has it has caused difficulty 

168.60 170.26 B: (( mm [lipsmack] i see [sigh] )) 

169.63 171.15 A: but um but 

172.09 175.96 A: [mn] i don't know i think friendship now is important so 

174.77 175.69 B: mhm 

176.12 179.65 A: i not that i'm gonna do it over again because i have my life partner 

179.33 180.70 B: mhm 

180.15 182.97 A: um you know we just work through the struggles 

184.23 195.35 B: [lipsmack] faith is a would be a very important factor for me i i am a born again christian i w- wouldn't follow the bible's dictates not to be unequally yoked 

195.08 195.95 A: right 

196.26 199.87 B: so that would be a very very high criteria for me 

199.84 202.10 A: if you were now looking for a life partner 

202.08 204.39 B: yeah if my wife died or something then 

203.53 205.35 A: yeah yeah 

204.77 210.01 B: um like i i wouldn't just go you know trolling around the singles bars or something 

209.36 211.82 A: right no actually my 

211.88 215.47 A: i i am a born again christian too my husband is a pastor and 

214.75 215.69 B: (( uh-huh [noise] uh-huh )) 

215.60 219.01 A: um i don't know that i'd get married again i mean 

219.02 227.13 A: you know my husband um was a pastor's son and [mn] you know people think hey you know 

227.16 238.53 A: get a pastor's son as a life partner [mn] if we use that term you know they've got good morals they've you know this and that they've been brought up right and that's not always the case because 

238.76 244.90 A: with my life partner um my husband has beat me and has beat my children and 

244.01 245.31 B: oh my goodness 

245.21 247.87 A: but he found the lord 

247.91 254.37 A: he really found the lord you know you think they've found the lord at nineteen but that wasn't the case 

253.90 254.87 B: i see 

254.68 258.96 A: he didn't have a re- personal relationship he just knew of god 

258.66 261.02 B: right knew a lot about him 

260.31 264.63 A: mm exactly and not until you get that personal relationship [mn] 

265.38 270.95 A: does it change a person and it it has changed my husband it has changed my life partner 

268.37 270.48 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

270.99 272.75 B: (( good )) 

271.50 274.82 A: you know so yeah i'm very thankful for that but 

274.94 277.80 B: what uh kind of church is he a pastor of 

277.05 279.48 A: he's a uh non denominational 

279.55 282.44 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

280.99 282.14 A: here in michigan 

283.99 285.31 A: (( so [noise] )) 

287.45 289.61 B: i think it's also er 

290.04 292.29 B: good to have some common interests 

292.30 293.13 A: oh 

293.32 294.45 B: (( um )) 

295.11 300.16 B: [noise] my wife is a singer and i'm i'm a just a music lover 

299.90 301.09 A: oh wow 

300.96 306.83 B: but uh i very much love to hear her sing so i thought that'd be kinda neat to have my own little songbird 

303.45 304.37 A: yes 

306.83 308.99 A: yeah that's where your compatibility 

308.80 309.36 B: (( [cough] )) 

309.11 313.29 A: takes place i guess you you both like the same thing 

310.45 311.55 B: uh-huh 

313.43 321.52 A: and with my life partner we're both the opposite yes he he does like music he was a music major in college and i don't care for music 

315.86 317.03 B: is that right 

321.06 322.23 B: (( hm )) 

321.53 323.39 A: and he likes 

323.51 324.93 A: cold weather 

325.25 327.83 A: and i like warm i like ninety degrees 

328.43 333.86 A: you know he i like to sleep with the window open he likes it closed you know just complete opposites 

334.25 338.91 A: but they say opposites [mn] you know attract each other i don't know but 

338.30 348.12 B: [lipsmack] [lipsmack] yeah my wife and i have a lot of o- opposites in our [mn] personalities i'm pretty laid back and she's pretty uh driven 

343.82 344.84 A: yeah 

348.02 349.37 A: oh okay 

349.36 353.61 B: but uh we do have one interest in music in common 

353.36 354.46 A: that's good 

354.04 358.27 B: she uh she does like um university of maryland football 

358.54 360.98 B: i'm sort of a sports fan in general 

360.70 361.58 A: okay 

361.12 364.14 B: so we we do have that that we can share in common 

364.53 365.82 A: okay yeah 

365.84 368.34 A: well uh [mn] not everything do we 

368.70 374.50 A: look at the opposite way but you know i think we've got more opposite than than 

370.84 371.87 B: uh-huh 

376.05 378.20 A: that things that we like together 

378.32 380.03 A: but you know we've 

380.06 382.31 A: made it a go and 

382.00 383.12 B: well super 

382.34 383.91 A: you know so 

384.77 389.86 A: [lipsmack] it's been a struggle but i i think i think being a friend first 

389.54 390.57 B: uh-huh 

390.58 398.42 A: i- is the first step and then you know all the other things will will line up if you know if that's w- what the lord has for you 

398.21 399.16 B: uh-huh 

398.81 402.05 A: you know it might not be the lord's you might want this person 

402.63 407.58 A: but the lord says i don't think so i think this one's more your style [laughter] 

406.46 407.39 B: uh-huh 

407.90 409.04 A: but 

410.99 411.88 B: i think 

411.11 412.75 A: how long have you been married 

412.35 416.20 B: uh i've been married uh thirteen years 

415.58 416.99 A: okay okay 

418.71 422.05 A: right i'm going on twenty nine actually 

421.86 424.50 B: uh-huh good 

428.76 432.47 B: um i figured also that it is important to have um 

432.62 440.56 B: some level of physical attraction i don't think that should be your highest priority but there does need to be an element of that there 

441.58 447.40 A: yeah it's long time yeah yeah yes yeah and and mine was more physical than any other thing 

447.17 448.10 B: (( i see )) 

447.68 454.99 A: but i was young i was only twenty one looking for a life partner you know what do you what do you know at twenty one looking for somebody that you're going to spend the rest of your life with 

454.60 457.74 B: [noise] yeah i was a little older i g- um 

457.94 461.25 B: i grad- i went through college and then i went to law school 

461.26 465.07 B: and when i was in law school i w- was 

465.45 467.14 B: (( very uh [mn] )) 

467.95 471.46 B: made a [mn] a conscious decision not to date 

471.58 472.68 A: oh 

472.06 475.79 B: um i knew that would be very distracting to me 

476.01 478.62 B: and uh so i was 

478.83 481.29 B: (( oh twenty )) 

481.95 484.45 B: uh twenty five 

485.04 490.19 B: when i graduated law school s- so just a little bit of extra time there 

489.53 491.11 A: (( yeah )) 

490.24 491.66 B: i think there's um 

491.74 505.26 B: i th- i i and i wouldn't i wouldn't judge someone else who who in time took a different path but [mn] for me i i know that would have been a a very big distraction if i'd [mn] tried to get romantically involved um while i was in in school 

505.26 506.09 A: right 

507.27 512.89 B: but some people are in law school and other kinds of schools like that er wh- and they're married 

507.56 508.29 A: i 

512.96 515.34 B: uh i think that would be really hard [noise] 

514.90 520.41 A: oh yeah yeah with all the things that come along with that and try to keep up your studies 

520.65 524.43 B: so that was an intentional decision on my part 

525.16 531.55 B: uh once i graduated from law school i was pretty much uh eager to get on with the rest of my life 

529.55 530.45 A: (( yeah )) 

530.85 532.16 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

532.97 536.83 A: and it was probably better working out that way you know get 

537.18 541.16 A: other things done first before you commit to someone 

542.16 547.81 B: [lipsmack] yeah we actually started dating right after i graduated law school my wife my wife and i 

546.09 546.97 A: wow 

547.36 548.33 A: yeah 

548.94 553.87 B: and we got married just a little over a year later about a year and a half later 

554.00 555.51 A: (( oh okay okay )) 

556.72 559.08 B: but we had been [mn] friends 

559.13 560.73 B: (( [mn] uh )) 

561.75 566.72 B: for at least a year prior to wh- ever dating i think more like two years 

567.07 569.45 A: wow that's re- that's really good 

570.01 573.93 A: that's really good i have a a twenty one year old daughter that's um 

574.35 577.80 A: [lipsmack] that's a born again christian and she feels the lord has said 

578.15 580.94 A: you don't date you're not looking 

581.71 585.62 A: you're gonna be friends you're going to do group 

586.18 587.34 A: and 

588.18 591.57 A: maybe eventually get married but no dating 

591.19 598.04 B: [lipsmack] well a lot of people uh in uh our church circles here are emphasizing the courting concept 

598.79 599.95 B: but is that something
