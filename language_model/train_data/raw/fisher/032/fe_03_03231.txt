90.32 97.22 A: [sigh] but ah yeah i feel pets a- are a big part of especially children's lives and even adults because i mean fish are 

97.64 103.93 A: some fish are very very calming you can sit and watch 'em and watch what they do and i find that calming 

103.58 104.62 B: right 

104.22 113.45 A: and therefore in pets i feel that you know [sigh] if it's for a child it's a companion for them a friend [sigh] if 

113.45 126.42 A: like as in my pit bull that i have in the house most people think that they're vicious animals but they're actually not [sigh] ah my pit's been around since my daughter got pregnant and he was the one who actually told us that my daughter went into labor 

126.58 132.24 A: [sigh] and he's been the most wonderful dog he's been the best companion [noise] to me 

133.23 141.91 B: right i had a friend who b- bred pit bulls when i was growing up and i knew that there was that big stigma of [sigh] you know stay away from her dogs but they were the most lovable dogs 

140.98 144.71 A: [noise] right it all depends on how you raise 'em [noise] 

143.83 144.85 B: correct 

144.71 155.83 A: [noise] i mean if you raise 'em to fight and you beat on 'em and you don't take care of 'em sure they're gonna be vicious [noise] they're gonna be mean [sigh] but if you raise a pit to know that okay this is your family 

155.73 168.43 A: [sigh] you protect your family but also you know don't be vicious to other people unless you're given a command [sigh] and i can count out of t- the two years that i've had the dog he's never once attacked nobody 

168.02 174.38 B: right it's kind of d- dogs i think are just kind of like humans also like if you raise them to be violent then they're gonna be 

173.72 175.13 A: (( [noise] right )) 

175.37 177.91 A: [noise] right i agree [laughter] 

177.98 187.66 A: and i mean as long as you give 'em food attention love run 'em play with 'em i mean they're perfect [sigh] i mean they they're there for you when you need 'em most [sigh] 

183.55 184.55 B: (( right [laughter] right )) 

187.50 188.74 B: (( [noise] uh-hum ))

198.75 199.68 A: (( [noise] yeah and )) 

199.60 205.68 A: ah our little puppy in the back he's only a- a- ah he's only four months old but he's not potty trained yet [sigh] 

205.61 216.34 A: and i don't want to throw him in the house and [sigh] he messes all over everything and then i have to fuss at him so we're training him by keeping in a cage [noise] and we only feed him three times a day 

213.73 214.79 B: (( uh-hum )) 

216.20 221.25 A: he h- has a small bowl of water when it's empty we go out and refill it [noise] but we let him know that's all you're getting 

221.08 224.73 A: [sigh] and if he uses it in his cage we 

224.49 236.81 A: t- tell him you know you've done wrong and we take a newspaper and spank him for it [sigh] and then we clean his cage out and we put him back in it so he's sort of gotten the concept now don't use it in the cage i've got to go outside to do it [sigh] 

231.17 232.02 B: right 

236.68 243.72 A: and we keep him in a covered porch that a way he's warm [noise] i keep a heater for him and [sigh] he stays real comfortable out there 

243.41 244.38 B: (( uh-hum )) 

243.69 248.43 A: it's not like s- some people who just take their animals throw 'em outside and forget about 'em 

247.99 248.93 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

248.36 261.06 A: [sigh] and we make sure that he comes in at least twice a week gets a bath gets de-ticked in case he goes in the yard and [sigh] we make sure that our animals are well taken care of i mean the smallest sniffle sneeze [sigh] wrong 

260.93 265.43 A: l- like little noise from 'em they're rushed off to the vet 

265.32 274.19 B: yeah i think that people get pets and they don't realize that they're a a financial responsibility just like [sigh] a child that you know you need to make sure that you can take care of them 

273.78 284.05 A: [sigh] i [sigh] right i mean i- it's like you get the dog you feed him you water 'em and they're perfectly fine i mean you have worm medicine they have shots they need just like an infant does [sigh] all the time [noise] 

282.36 283.21 B: (( uh-hum )) 

284.30 294.79 A: [sigh] and i'm trying to instill that into my grandson because he spends a lot of time with me and i try and instill that in him [sigh] that he has to go out there and feed the dog he has to water the dog and he's only two 

294.55 306.71 A: [sigh] [sigh] but he understands the concept when the dog scratches he knows it's time to go feed him and he runs for the food he gets the water and he goes takes care of the dog [sigh] when it's vet time he loads the dog in the car and [sigh] he knows 

294.72 295.51 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

306.64 310.80 A: he knows the routine i try and instill that in my grandchildren while they're young 

311.18 319.40 A: [sigh] because if you don't teach 'em now they're going to grow up and not know unless you teach 'em at a later age and then they may not get the concept [sigh] 

318.88 320.11 B: (( [noise] [noise] right right )) 

323.35 325.72 B: yeah i think you can learn a lot f- from a pet 

325.07 326.75 A: [noise] [sigh] oh yeah 

326.26 333.90 B: i think it's a i think if you can afford to have them [sigh] and you're in you're in a place where you can have a pet then it's good if you have children to get a pet 

333.94 339.92 A: [noise] right right and there is a lot of people this day and age that i just don't understand [noise] i mean 

333.96 335.64 B: to grow up against 

340.06 353.50 A: you try and look for a decent place to live for your animals so they have room to run and play outside and [sigh] most people today are like pets are a bad thing you're not allowed to have a pet in my home and i'm like well i'm not going to let them get in or i'm not going to buy 

353.58 362.02 A: [sigh] or even a- attempt to rent if i can't have my animal there just because you had a bad experience before [sigh] you need to give somebody else a chance 

361.98 362.77 B: right 

362.52 374.98 A: and that's like the home i'm in the process of buying now i'm allowed to have all the animals i want [noise] and my landlord is amazed because he's like oh my god you know you're animals don't tear up [mn] and we're like 'cause they were taught right [noise] 

366.98 367.87 B: (( uh-hum )) 

375.40 383.54 A: we take 'em out when they need to go we feed 'em we water 'em i mean these dogs even get a bath even the one inside gets a bath every night just like a human 

383.92 386.76 A: [sigh] he's very spoiled [laughter]

463.14 471.98 A: it's like with a baiter they're quiet and they just lay there like they're dead [sigh] but then again the minute the food hits the water poop they're all over 

471.65 472.58 B: (( [noise] right )) 

471.84 486.82 A: [sigh] and it's really interesting to have 'em because you don't need the water pump and everything [noise] you just give 'em their water their special water they need [sigh] and their food [sigh] but there's no pump that they need or anything [sigh] they're real easy to tend with they're real easy to clean they're awesome animals 

487.95 496.52 A: [sigh] and i've also heard of the ones that you had before [noise] and they're really [noise] neat but with m- my grandson he would want to stick his hand in the fish aquarium 

496.64 499.07 B: [noise] [noise] oh yeah not good [laughter] 

496.77 506.29 A: [sigh] that's why we chose a baiter because it has the closeable lid to where he can't get into it i just have to watch him with dumping the water [sigh] [noise] 

503.05 503.99 B: (( uh-hum )) 

509.83 515.49 B: yeah my when my brother was little he had a goldfish that he won at a carnival [sigh] and he would pet it 

515.25 516.87 A: [laughter] [mn] 

515.65 519.12 B: [sigh] we'd walk in and he'd hold it in his hand and be petting it 

519.10 520.51 A: oh l- [laughter] lord [sigh] 

519.81 522.89 B: [laughter] it's funny 

522.64 524.54 A: oh yeah 

524.55 538.07 A: [sigh] yeah i mean it's just p- pretty much like i said before any animal you get you just have to show 'em love and attention and affection i mean just like you would any animal [noise] i mean if y- you [noise] have children grand children a husband [noise] [sigh] i mean [sigh] 

532.65 533.49 B: (( [noise] [mn] uh-hum )) 

538.02 542.65 A: if you're gonna pay them attention you need to turn around and pay your animal just as much attention 

542.71 543.58 B: (( [noise] right )) 

542.76 553.91 A: [noise] i mean i don't care if i go and walk to the mailbox my dog's right there at my side [sigh] even the puppy when my when my grand kids are here and they're outside and playing we turn all the dogs loose [sigh] [noise] 

553.95 561.24 A: and it kind of makes the neighbors uneasy but like we tell 'em the dog's not going to hurt nobody [sigh] he's the most loving dog you've ever seen 

561.58 568.05 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] i mean we can and most cops are even scared of pit bulls and i mean [sigh] my aunt well 

565.41 566.30 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

568.10 577.35 A: excuse me my sister runs a pit bull kennel [sigh] and she sells her dogs to t- the police department to help sniff out c- criminals and stuff 

576.98 577.80 B: (( uh-hum )) 

577.48 582.03 A: and it's quite interesting because most cops are scared to death of pit bulls [sigh] 

582.62 586.45 A: and it's like it all depends on how you train them 

586.47 591.46 B: right they just have the stigma and and people who have raised them to be attack dogs 

591.36 592.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] correct [sigh] )) 

593.45 595.11 B: so people just see that [noise] 

595.16 596.29 A: right
