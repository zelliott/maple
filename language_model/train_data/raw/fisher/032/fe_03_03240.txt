71.03 75.56 B: [sigh] i've tried all my life to exercise and it's just [sigh] i 

75.54 80.69 B: always take dance classes and i i love that because it r- requires 

80.51 93.69 B: you know some thinking but people who can just [sigh] exercise and not think not have anything to distract them just [sigh] i don't see how they do it i i would just go insane 'cause all i can think about is how much it it's h- hurting [laughter] 

93.03 105.34 A: [mn] [laughter] [noise] [laughter] yeah well i i just don't e- enjoy it [sigh] the only thing i do is i do [sigh] and i'm not doing it right now but i do 

105.79 107.53 A: water aerobics 

107.93 111.23 B: [sigh] that's what a lot of people say they really like 

110.51 119.34 A: and i enjoy doing that [mn] um it makes you feel good it's not h- hard on you [sigh] um 

120.25 125.17 A: you're i mean you get a good work out and um

141.10 142.52 B: (( yeah )) 

141.32 145.93 A: [sigh] and p- people that don't live with it have no clue what we're t- [laughter] talking about 

144.95 148.11 B: (( [laughter] no of course not and you know [noise] you )) 

148.24 150.65 B: go out there and o- oh 

149.56 162.12 A: well ah except except in el paso now we went to el paso about [laughter] [sigh] oh three years ago i guess [noise] and and the humidity got up to twenty percent while we were there [sigh] and you 

153.14 154.58 B: [laughter] 

160.50 163.28 B: m- m- miserable in summer [laughter] 

161.92 169.82 A: heard people in church complaining i thought it was wonderful [laughter] it was h- hot but it wasn't hot like it is here [noise] [noise] 

169.51 181.94 B: yeah it's true [sigh] [mn] it's just i just don't you know once it gets up to about ninety there's just i'm not going to be going out doing a whole lot of stuff because i'll stay inside and you know again that's [sigh] for 

182.05 195.86 B: dance classes or i mean if i could if i had somewhere i would do w- water aerobics because that's the same thing [sigh] you can be [sigh] in the pool and actually that might be something i should consider because it's low impact and it probably wouldn't mess with my back as much so 

195.07 206.61 A: um the the class that i attend there are a lot of [sigh] people the doctors have recommended that they go t- there [lipsmack] 

205.67 211.58 B: [mn] yeah and i think i remember i've had a physical a physical therapist say that that could be a good thing to do 

210.66 213.02 A: um it's um 

215.06 228.65 A: [lipsmack] r- r- r well ah like ah just walking back and forth in about waist deep water [sigh] fifteen minutes in the pool at a very slow pace [sigh] is equivalent to walking an hour [noise] 

228.34 229.50 B: really 

228.91 229.91 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

230.01 232.70 B: that's that's nice [laughter] 

231.72 234.54 A: (( uh-hum uh-hum )) 

233.36 236.22 B: [sigh] yeah that's really that's a good idea 

234.59 243.44 A: the the amount of energy that [noise] you expend [sigh] ah in relation to you know [noise] what you get back for it is is very minimal 

243.57 248.52 B: that's [sigh] really that's really good i didn't realize that it was the benefits were that that much 

244.26 244.82 A: (( [sigh] )) 

247.12 256.37 A: uh-huh and ah the the class that i that i go to [sigh] we walk for fifteen minutes before we start the 

256.30 264.15 A: you know doing the exercises [sigh] and then we stretch and m- move around it moves every joint in your body 

264.39 272.46 A: it's very good for arthritis [sigh] very good physical therapy [noise] ah i have a friend that just had a knee replacement [sigh] 

272.10 273.26 B: (( uh-hum )) 

272.66 276.35 A: ah her doctor recommended she do that [mn] 

276.07 288.21 B: in fact my my grandmother um swears by it she [sigh] you know she's like me she'll exercise she'll exercise but she says she's had k- knee replacement s- surgery and she has arthritis and everything and 

285.12 286.15 A: (( no uh-hum [noise] )) 

288.60 297.14 B: [sigh] i i'm really kind of afraid that i'm inheriting all of all all of those t- traits so it would be good to [laughter] i'm probably too 

293.86 297.40 A: well you probably are [laughter] 

297.24 303.38 B: [laughter] [sigh] i'm twenty six years old [laughter] and a c- couple of weeks ago i was walking around like a hunchback so 

302.96 310.92 A: well sounds to me like you probably are [sigh] now we had a girl in our class last summer [sigh] that was in a car wreck 

303.91 305.39 B: [laughter] 

305.59 306.75 B: [laughter] 

310.69 314.31 B: oh yeah that that's one of the things that happened to me [sigh] 

311.57 313.21 A: and she was 

313.31 315.28 A: she was ah 

315.42 317.36 A: [lipsmack] eighteen or nineteen [sigh] 

317.66 320.14 A: and her doctor had sent her there 

319.86 320.83 B: uh-huh 

320.92 328.44 B: which [sigh] that's definitely something i should consider especially as it gets hotter because i won't do it [sigh] in the heat 

325.48 327.82 A: [lipsmack] ah yeah yeah 

328.04 334.41 A: uh-hum [lipsmack] well um w- we have a a s- sports com and ah

334.71 349.42 A: [sigh] they have a heated indoor pool and [mn] [sigh] it's heated to the temperature i've forgotten exactly what it is like seventy four [noise] [sigh] somewhere there abouts it's heated to the temperature for [sigh] people with arthritis 

349.21 350.80 B: oh okay 

350.95 355.55 A: [noise] they also have [noise] they also have some [noise] others um 

351.09 353.15 B: that's really yeah 

355.77 358.50 A: (( g- g- groups that [noise] um )) 

358.57 362.34 A: [noise] maybe don't work every thing in your body but um 

362.22 362.86 B: (( [sigh] )) 

364.12 366.21 B: just whatever you need i guess 

365.31 372.38 A: [sigh] um yeah i found that it it mak- it just gives me a little bit more stamina i'm fifty nine

374.45 375.38 B: (( so )) 

376.54 378.96 B: that's definitely something to consider

483.15 496.84 A: [noise] [sigh] many many years ago i mean i played sports when i i played basketball when i was in high school [sigh] um i didn't like doing the exercise then i enjoyed playing ball but i didn't like all the o- other stuff that went with it [sigh] [noise] 

496.30 504.02 B: oh yeah oh competition yeah i mean that's f- fun but no we're not even but i mean whenever there's a game involved

509.36 510.73 B: (( no )) 

511.65 523.47 B: it's not fun and it h- h- hurts [laughter] [sigh] you can make it of course there's so many kids j- just make it to where you could just not think about it for you know thirty minutes a day and just do [sigh] 

523.38 524.75 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [sigh] [noise] )) 

523.58 527.32 B: they would you know make a million jillion dollars too so 

526.45 528.50 A: [noise] oh yeah oh yeah [noise] 

527.41 534.00 B: it's just not going to happen if there could be some sort of self hypnosis that just let you forget about that half hour of the day [sigh] 

533.32 535.11 A: right right 

534.01 537.03 B: it would be [sigh] something interesting 

536.71 538.16 A: but um 

537.47 538.30 B: (( [sigh] )) 

538.19 544.62 A: you know if you're having back problems and what have you the [sigh] the water aerobics would be good for you i think 

544.37 550.04 B: that's that's probably something i should consider because i i need to do something besides 

550.32 558.71 B: you know i mean everybody's always oh just rest just rest but at the same time the more you rest the more tired you are whenever you do anything 

558.15 560.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum uh-hum )) 

559.10 560.70 B: so it's just 

560.84 568.36 B: it it sometimes it it's good that you do that i do it but at the same time i just feel like i'm sapped of everything 

568.14 569.88 A: (( uh-hum uh-hum )) 

568.91 573.43 B: you know so definitely that would be something to consider doing [sigh] 

571.81 575.74 A: [noise] yeah you'll have to check into it 

575.44 578.48 B: p- so [sigh] so it's just it's very um 

579.14 584.96 B: [mn] i would think p- passive but very meditative at the same time it can be really relaxing 

585.03 586.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] it is )) 

585.58 587.39 B: i would hope [laughter] 

586.53 594.92 A: it is [sigh] well we have a [sigh] we have one little lady [sigh] that i get so tickled she must weigh [sigh] maybe eighty pounds [sigh]
