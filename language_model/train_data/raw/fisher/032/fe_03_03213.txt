108.35 118.51 A: harm his young daughter but i was going to get some grapefruit this morning he he says bob anytime you want any grapefruit just pick it off my tree so 

118.39 131.26 A: i was going over towards the tree and i looked down at this uh trap that had been there i guess for about a week [laughter] and dolefully looking up at me were these great big green eyes of a cat [laughter] 

130.34 131.25 B: oh 

131.04 143.31 A: so and the the cat was in the cage and it just was looking at me so i went over and and uh had to release the trap and the trap was so small that i had to uh 

143.28 149.64 A: [noise] l- lift it up and and back the animal out you see because because i mean he couldn't turn around 

149.59 163.30 A: and the minute he got out he he just leaped for the wood fence and went you could hear his claws going up the wood fence and and i never saw him again he never even looked back to say thank you you know [laughter] no 

160.72 164.21 B: [laughter] oh he's never going to come back you know he's never going to come back [noise] 

163.39 166.68 A: no so um uh but uh 

166.71 168.02 A: um 

168.04 172.01 A: tha- that's about the most recent experience except 

172.36 177.38 A: um two or three years ago i had a really strange experience uh the uh 

177.80 184.18 A: it was a nice saturday afternoon and i decided ra- i didn't want to shine my shoes inside i wanted some sunshine so 

183.94 196.43 A: i got a little stool and i was outside doing my shoes like you know you used to do back in the well you've never been in the army you're in college but anyway you always had to shine your shoes and it was saturday afternoon it was sunday and i thought you know i'd shine my shoes 

192.43 193.90 B: (( right mm )) 

196.21 199.13 A: so i'm sitting there shining my shoes and all of a sudden 

199.55 203.30 A: [mn] down beside me about um oh i'd say 

203.30 216.06 A: two feet away lands this beautiful um sort of pinkish rusty pinkish uh carrier pigeon he i knew it was a carrier pigeon because he had the uh bracelet on his leg 

215.90 216.65 B: (( [noise] )) 

216.73 220.28 A: and he turned his head and looked at me and he said you know uh 

220.54 232.09 A: i'm hungry and i said oh you are huh and he said yeah yeah and i said well you're in you're indeed in luck because just the other day i had bought some millet a friend of mine told me how to make millet 

231.87 243.64 A: and use it for breakfast cereal see so i still had the raw millet so i went inside and got some and and he waited patiently and he came out and uh he gobbled up the millet and he said uh 

243.97 256.99 A: gee uh have you got some more of that and i said yeah yeah so i went inside and i got some more and came out and he said now uh if you leave some out for me i'll i'll uh be back uh tomorrow and i said okay so 

256.83 266.19 A: i noticed that it rained that night and i couldn't imagine where this bird found shelter but anyway i had a garage and i was hoping that maybe 

266.08 272.80 A: he'd go in the garage and shelter himself there whatever but in the morning sunday morning i'm going out the door 

272.62 286.38 A: and there's the bird so i got the more food out for him and uh he did that every morning and then finally during the day he'd perch himself across on the rooftop of the house uh uh the the houses down here are only normally one story high and so 

286.31 290.84 A: you know he'd sit up there and sun himself and um so um 

290.78 303.66 A: every day uh he'd keep coming down for food and that went on for a couple or three days and [noise] i thought well w- gee maybe maybe i'm going to be lucky enough to own a bird you know because he was a handsome looking bird 

303.56 310.12 A: and uh but he had that bracelet on and i knew he belonged to somebody and i actually got him once um 

310.03 323.51 A: b- but he was a little fearful so i didn't want to cause any trauma in the bird uh so i didn't pet him or get any closer although i could reach out and touch him and did once grab him to look at the uh leg bracelet but anyway 

323.38 325.98 A: so um one day 

326.71 328.97 A: uh bu- after about the third fourth day 

328.83 335.23 A: he put on a demonstration for me he he had some food and he said now i'm i want you to watch me fly and he soared around 

335.01 346.87 A: just like a jet he opened his wings up you know and he soared through the air and gl- gl- uh glided around and land back on the roof and he looked over at me and i'm standing and he says what do you think of that and i said tha- that's pretty neat 

346.81 352.21 A: and so then i went inside and i thought well i'll do something special so i cut open a green pepper 

352.24 357.49 A: with the seeds in it you know and i thought sure enough the bird would like the green seeds 

354.24 355.04 B: mhm [noise] 

357.75 363.43 A: well he came down looked at that and said no way [noise] i want my millet and uh 

363.24 365.87 A: so i gave him some more millet and uh 

365.68 376.71 A: then he he said well uh this is it i've gotta you know continue on my voyage and and go back now that i'm rested and had food for four or five days and so he took off and flew 

376.66 387.51 A: into the horizon and i never saw him again but [laughter] that was my bird experience as a uh four days of a pet [laughter] 

384.92 388.06 B: mm four days then he left you [laughter] 

387.37 396.23 A: [laughter] yeah but he left he but uh you know bu- well of course it th- the the bracelet indicated that it was somebody's property and the bird 

396.03 402.77 A: i guess had uh tired out or maybe lost his direction or just was plain hungry 

402.74 411.09 A: because he landed right beside me can you imagine you're shining your shoes and here comes a bird and lands right beside you 

411.00 413.84 B: yeah usually birds don't do that uh [noise] 

412.78 419.71 A: i know yeah and uh especially when he looked at me a- and uh um i mean i just 

419.67 428.13 A: realised that i had a bird brain [laughter] i could understand what he wanted [laughter] 

425.69 430.72 B: that's pretty cool i i mean i guess you must be a pet person you're obviously like an animal person 

430.74 436.81 B: i mean i don't know what my dog wants my dog just comes up to me it bites me and i don't know what it wants 

431.04 432.96 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

433.52 435.38 A: well 

436.29 441.62 A: oh well in service um i i'm seventy two so a bit your senior but 

441.25 442.29 B: wow 

441.64 445.23 A: in in the military service uh over in japan 

445.24 446.11 A: um 

446.02 460.86 A: we lived in this uh w- uh quanson hut a number of quanson huts it made up a a an e. shaped building and for some reason the guys got a dog and uh they called it debasan which means uh uh honorable honorable fat dog 

460.50 461.82 B: [laughter] 

460.64 472.04 A: and uh and uh you know everything's honorable by with the san at the end you know you never call yourself bob san you would call yourself bob but you would uh i would call you 

471.82 478.13 A: um uh by your first name and add san to it and that makes you honorable well anyway so 

478.10 488.33 A: everybody loved the dog oh the and i never saw the dog very much except that if if the dog went out and rolled around in some fish 

488.32 497.01 A: or something like that that was somewhat indigenous to japan or uh a pile of fish or or whatever in the neighborhood [laughter] 

497.01 506.71 A: nobody wanted to have anything to do with this dog because it reeked of fish and everything else so i would dutifully take off my clothes 

500.47 502.08 B: (( [noise] [laughter] ew no )) 

507.18 512.51 A: and she'd follow me i i'd grab her by the collar i guess and i'd take her in the shower 

512.34 523.56 A: and i'd squeeze her between my legs and take a shower [laughter] to get the dog all cleaned off well of course it's cold sometimes in japan in the wintertime so 

516.91 517.49 B: (( [laughter] )) 

523.33 533.55 A: we had these little space heaters that were actually on the floor and that's what uh kept uh each room warm and i'd put down some paper on the floor 

533.37 539.45 A: and tell her to lie on it and then put a like a little tee pee of uh loose paper over her 

539.27 541.00 A: and she'd stay there 

540.88 544.33 A: until she was warm and dried off and then she'd get up and i wouldn't 

544.30 558.49 A: see her for another two to three weeks [laughter] until she went out and yeah rolled around in some more fish and everybody kicked her out of the uh room you know that she go from one room to the other and uh you know it was uh she was sort of queen of the roost 

547.19 549.45 B: (( [noise] until she ran into some more fish [noise] [noise] [noise] ))
