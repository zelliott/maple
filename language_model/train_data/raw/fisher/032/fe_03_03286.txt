12.33 13.32 B: good 

14.06 18.36 B: well i guess our topic is uh what's the most important thing in 

18.40 21.50 B: to look for when you're looking for your life partner 

21.96 23.24 A: mhm 

22.61 26.54 B: and i guess i should ask you are you married or 

26.47 27.87 A: yes i'm married

28.08 30.51 A: (( going on fifteen years )) 

28.52 29.92 B: i'm married too 

30.28 31.65 B: fifteen years

39.97 41.75 A: [mn] very close there 

41.36 44.89 B: yeah we'll be six we'll be six years in july so 

46.56 48.44 B: well um 

46.71 47.99 A: yeah 

48.75 54.36 B: what what do you think probably was the most important factor when you were looking 

54.55 56.13 A: uh i think 

54.74 55.92 B: for someone 

56.88 61.05 A: he was willing to consider my feelings and listen to me 

61.43 62.46 B: mhm 

62.01 63.56 A: you know try to 

64.02 65.95 A: see both sides of the issue 

66.62 68.01 B: that's good 

68.06 69.21 A: what about you 

69.37 77.83 B: um i don't know i think probably that we had the same [noise] goals and objectives [noise] you know like we were working toward the same 

78.16 79.62 B: type of 

79.63 81.24 B: life i guess 

81.07 81.97 A: right 

81.42 84.97 B: you know we both wanted to have a family and 

85.00 87.81 B: um just have kind of similar 

88.46 91.65 B: religious um beliefs and goals 

92.03 93.04 B: so 

92.95 98.53 A: yeah i guess that would be important too we both went to the same church and that was easy to 

98.24 99.19 B: uh-huh 

98.77 102.44 A: you know that wasn't a barrier between us that worked out very well 

100.83 104.95 B: yeah i think that's that's uh important especially if you're both 

105.09 110.70 B: you know not only maybe belonging to the same church but that you both have the same level of commitment 

110.39 111.73 A: right 

110.82 112.03 B: perhaps 

112.54 117.63 B: but um that was really important to me i i don't know that i ever really 

118.08 122.54 B: i guess i did think about that as being something very important that maybe that was like my 

122.57 131.88 B: you know base work i just always assumed i would marry someone who was who had my same belief system but it certainly makes things easier i think 

129.15 130.07 A: right 

131.75 138.29 A: yes i've seen lots of couples you know that didn't and it was a hard thing that they had to overcome you know 

137.87 138.86 B: (( mhm )) 

139.57 144.54 B: yeah my um my grandma when she married my grandfather um 

145.34 155.45 B: they did not you know she belonged to a church and he did not and for however many years they raised eight children and she always took 'em to church and he ended up going with her 

155.48 157.55 B: uh every once in a while and 

157.76 165.34 B: he never let the kids be baptized into the church until they were eighteen years old and and um but eventually they 

165.54 167.68 B: uh they all did and actually 

167.69 168.85 B: um 

169.42 182.30 B: by the time my mum had turned eighteen i think uh he decided finally that he was going to join the church too so it's interesting that i mean they've been married now fifty years and i can't imagine them ever being with anyone else 

182.45 187.03 B: so [noise] i guess that can't be like a total determining factor since they neither of them 

187.37 195.69 A: oh no i think many marriages go on without it but you know it would be a more difficult marriage i believe you know if you've got that battle i think 

195.23 196.61 B: i think so too 

196.70 199.86 B: [noise] gotta be really strong people to be able to 

200.03 202.28 B: [noise] to go through with that still 

202.67 203.88 A: yeah 

203.74 204.80 B: so 

205.15 206.67 A: (( uh i )) 

207.49 212.45 A: think a lot of times also it depends on you know like you said you want the same thing 

211.85 213.24 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

212.48 220.57 A: like one battle in our marriage has always been the fact of him wanting me to work and i want to stay home 

220.52 221.48 B: uh-huh 

221.12 225.96 A: and so that's always been a battle you know i wish that that could be different 

225.37 226.30 B: uh-huh 

225.98 227.26 A: (( but um )) 

227.63 229.73 A: you know other than that 

229.16 230.57 B: do you have children 

230.37 231.67 A: yeah i have two 

231.50 232.51 B: two kids 

232.53 234.03 A: yeah 

233.56 239.10 B: that's great yeah i always i worked until i had my baby 

239.27 240.28 B: and then 

240.47 244.09 B: i guess we've both just decided it was probably best if i didn't 

244.31 246.95 B: um work and so 

246.90 251.85 A: well it only makes sense i mean day care is so high and everything else you know 

247.05 248.17 B: i'm glad 

251.36 259.03 B: yeah well by the time you figure it out you know for the cost of day care and the cost of commuting to work and you know everything else it just 

259.24 268.51 B: you know and then taxes it just everything just kind of worked that it probably isn't that much of a difference in the money we're making if i stay home or 

268.65 269.95 B: or uh 

270.05 273.37 B: put her in day care and i'd much rather be home with her 

273.16 280.02 A: right i would too i you know i've always kept mine and it i've kept others in order to keep mine you know 

279.79 284.73 B: yeah my cousin does that and i think she it's a good alternative for her 

285.31 287.27 A: (( yeah so )) 

290.55 292.44 B: oh another 

293.19 299.58 B: thing that i think was important for me was finding someone with a good sense of humor just because 

299.74 300.78 B: i think 

301.14 302.08 B: uh 

302.43 305.63 B: especially for me that's one way that i really 

305.72 314.72 B: um deal with things and stress and that kind of thing is by you know laughing at myself and um you know having 

314.84 318.67 B: being able to laugh at situations and and look back on things 

318.69 328.98 B: you know or even you know when you're middle of so big crisis or something and still keep things focused and and be able to [noise] have a sense of humor about things 

329.20 333.96 B: [noise] rather than being you know just really serious and stressed out about things a lot so 

334.09 342.50 A: yeah it does help it also helps to be able to you know enjoy doing some of the same things you don't have to enjoy everything 

334.17 336.31 B: was something else important 

342.57 356.24 A: but like you know we like to go to other couple's houses and play games and stuff like that and we both really enjoy that you know and it makes for an enjoyable time especially with the friends that have kids our our kids ages you know 

349.62 350.61 B: mhm 

355.82 356.76 B: uh-huh 

356.25 363.26 A: it makes a good environment for the whole family you know to enjoy a night out without having to go out and spend a lot of money or whatever 

363.03 364.02 B: mhm 

364.05 364.82 A: so 

364.13 365.59 B: yeah that is good 

365.52 378.07 B: i know it's in a lot of ways my husband and i have very different interests but we still have enough of the same that we have things that we enjoy doing together like he he really enjoys um sports he likes 

377.88 383.27 B: not watching sports which thank goodness because i think watching sports is the most boring thing known to man 

383.50 395.36 B: don't ask me why but [laughter] i never enjoyed it but he doesn't like to watch sports but he likes to play sports he loves to go you know play basketball or racquetball or go jogging and stuff and i've never been a really huge 

391.52 392.47 A: right 

395.40 409.10 B: sports person i'm not very coordinated and you know about the most exercise thing i do is um go jogging every once in a while but um so that's not something that we necessarily do together a lot but we do enjoy 

409.29 410.36 B: um 

411.16 419.02 B: i i'm an artist too and he has absolutely no artistic talent but he likes to look at art i look at art we like to 

419.22 428.79 B: um he's really into um making improvements on the home and stuff like that and i really enjoy decorating and so we have a lot of fun 

429.12 430.10 B: um 

430.25 432.76 B: you know doing projects on the house together 

432.35 436.46 A: yeah that would be neat my husband's totally not into the house at all 

436.14 437.55 B: [laughter] 

436.66 440.87 A: you know getting him to change a light bulb is like you know major ordeal 

440.52 442.03 B: [laughter] 

440.92 450.94 A: [laughter] i like decorating the house and doing stuff to it you know but he's more of an outdoors person he would rather go hunting or fishing or you know 

447.27 448.29 B: mhm 

450.58 451.59 B: uh-huh 

451.05 457.68 A: that kind of sports stuff not basketball and stuff he likes watching the sports [laughter] 

454.80 455.80 B: mhm 

457.04 465.12 B: yeah see i'd rather i'd rather go uh hunting well not hunting i'd rather go camping or fishing or something like that and my husband's not into that so much 

464.95 468.68 A: see i'm not either i'm a totally inside person 

465.19 466.15 B: but 

468.19 469.75 B: [laughter] 

469.17 474.93 A: i like the computer and the television and you know in my house like he is so 

472.09 473.23 B: mhm 

475.40 476.74 A: but uh 

477.49 485.16 B: but still you know even though you have different interests which is good because i think it lessens with competition like i know a couple that 

485.09 490.79 B: um they both were really you know big basketball liked to play basketball and they were always 

490.66 505.53 B: just like oh my gosh they would get into these big fights and stuff over uh i don't think they played like one on one very much well maybe they did but um like when he would watch her play he would get on her and tell her things to do and just you did this wrong and you need to do this and 

505.42 517.72 B: they would just yell at each other about you know how they were doing in sports and i just though oh it's a good thing i'm not athlete 'cause i wonder if he always be trying to correct or if i'd always be pointing things out to him or stuff so 

517.72 518.77 A: (( yeah )) 

518.21 523.59 B: it's good to have different interests but then still have common ground where you have things you enjoy doing together 

521.86 525.92 A: right as long as there's stuff you can enjoy doing together you know 

525.46 526.52 B: mhm 

525.96 529.71 A: it helps keep the family unity going you know 

528.81 530.89 B: [laughter] 

529.89 535.34 A: because otherwise you would never spend any time together you know if you didn't have any common interest 

532.46 533.52 B: yeah 

535.95 536.77 A: so 

537.44 538.67 A: yeah i think 

538.98 549.85 A: choosing your life partner is very important you know to really think about what you're doing at the time we were awful young so we've had to grow into a lot of it as we went you know 

549.01 550.01 B: mhm 

550.27 555.43 A: 'cause we dated three years before we got married but still we were only twenty when we got married so 

554.95 560.05 B: yeah i see we did the same thing we did three years and i was twenty but he was twenty four 

560.24 561.21 B: so 

561.46 564.17 B: uh still you know pretty young and 

564.44 566.44 B: leaves a lot of time to 

566.59 575.47 B: you know if you've dated for three years you're not like you know jumping into something you don't really know what you're doing but um you also have a lot of growing to do together 

572.87 576.57 A: but you're still awful young and a lot of things change too 

575.83 576.98 B: (( mhm )) 

577.39 583.75 B: yeah and especially at that young age you know you're always kind of struggling financially to make things work and 

583.55 586.40 A: yeah i was still in college when we got married so 

586.19 590.17 B: yeah i still had a year left and he had just graduated
