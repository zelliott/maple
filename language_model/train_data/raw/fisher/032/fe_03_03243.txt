0.60 1.81 A: hello 

1.36 3.99 B: hi i'm melissa from philadelphia 

3.77 5.93 A: hi i'm alice from new jersey 

6.03 7.04 B: how are you 

6.84 7.75 A: hi 

8.10 11.36 A: um i don't know about you but i didn't understand [laughter] the question 

11.23 13.05 B: (( you didn't hear the question )) 

12.60 15.09 A: i i heard it but i don't really understand it 

14.52 26.23 B: oh you know i don't either corp- i mean i don't really honestly i don't really pay attention to that sort of thing and i know that's kind of you know i'm young and naive but i'm not really 

27.28 29.67 B: unfortunately i'm not really concerned with 

30.17 31.94 B: that sort of thing 

32.27 35.58 A: well i think that you know a lot of the time is 

35.59 38.09 A: stuff that wouldn't be news 

38.22 41.58 A: if they you know unless they needed something to fill out the news 

40.90 44.03 B: [laughter] right yeah yeah that's probably true 

43.50 44.74 A: because i mean 

44.81 47.64 A: business is business people just do stuff 

47.19 51.16 B: yeah i mean i don't really think there's anything the government could do 

50.71 55.22 A: yeah the government i don't the government should do anything about it you know 

51.30 53.25 B: to stop that 

55.29 59.07 A: there's there's a limit to how much regulation is a good idea 

58.59 59.71 B: right 

59.97 63.12 B: yeah yeah that's a good point i mean because once they start 

63.32 71.98 B: you know working on the regulations for corporations eventually it's gonna trickle down to small businesses and a lot of them will probably you know 

63.35 64.33 A: you know 

69.64 70.81 A: yeah 

71.37 73.97 A: i am a small business owner and and 

73.32 76.12 B: oh you are what kind of business do you have 

74.20 75.17 A: (( yeah )) 

75.72 77.58 A: um computer consulting 

77.53 78.78 B: oh yeah 

78.19 84.06 A: yeah but uh you know i don't want the government telling me how to do business 

83.91 88.01 B: oh yeah i i can understand that i really 

88.40 93.35 B: i seriously wouldn't want someone telling me how to do just about anything i mean 

93.15 94.42 A: yeah 

93.56 98.26 B: i understand that we need rules and stuff but please don't you know 

96.94 102.49 A: there's there's there's some things that need to be regulated just you know for commonsense 

101.85 103.09 B: mhm 

102.89 110.71 A: but there's a lot of things that are really nobody's business and it's up to the people who are doing them to work out the details 

103.45 104.54 B: yeah 

109.57 110.95 B: mhm 

110.76 113.60 A: and i think business to a large degree is that way 

113.21 114.24 B: right 

114.41 120.15 A: and you know if a if a business is really corrupt it'll it'll get caught on the 

119.24 121.65 B: (( yeah yeah absolutely )) 

120.32 125.93 A: you know it'll either collapse of its weight or it'll get caught i mean look at this enron business you know 

122.76 123.78 B: yeah 

125.16 129.00 B: right right i mean you can't you can't go on like that forever and 

128.14 129.17 A: right 

129.46 133.66 A: but you know things things have been going on for thousands of years and you know 

133.55 144.53 A: a a little contribution here a little skimmed off the top there a little hiring your idiot nephew 'cause he needs needs a job that kind of stuff you know 

141.60 146.80 B: [laughter] yeah 

146.76 150.43 A: trouble is the idiot nephew got managed to buy himself an election this time 

150.08 153.72 B: (( [laughter] yeah well as far as [laughter] i don't )) 

154.75 158.84 B: know as far as the recession's concerned i don't i don't really 

159.48 163.62 A: i tend to think of you know the economy and recession and inflation 

163.71 164.63 A: and the 

164.65 166.39 A: i to me that's weather 

166.46 168.27 B: yeah i i 

166.82 169.41 A: you know there's nothing you can do about it 

168.42 173.74 B: exactly and i don't i don't think that the corruption in the business has anything to do with that i mean 

172.97 180.52 A: no it it if anything it's hysteria in the press has more to do with it because it scares people into into 

177.69 179.68 B: right yeah exactly 

179.82 184.95 B: exactly exactly uh what was it for instance the other day 

185.05 198.36 B: on the news they were talking uh there's this bank it's something based in chinatown it's like for for asians it's not a very well known bank have you heard about this there was that rumor and so everybody just 

193.13 194.21 A: yeah 

194.90 195.93 A: (( yes )) 

196.67 200.43 A: yeah there was a run on the bank it sounded like nineteen twenty nine 

198.65 199.59 B: (( yeah i )) 

200.58 203.29 B: know that's insane i mean 

203.40 209.54 B: that is that's definitely the media's fault that had nothing to do with corruption that 

210.14 215.08 B: well i say that you know three weeks from now we'll find out that something weird happened but 

215.09 216.10 A: right 

217.38 220.71 B: wow they really gave us a boring topic tonight 

220.81 222.13 B: (( [laughter] )) 

221.61 222.78 A: yeah well 

223.13 225.58 A: they gave me sports one time 

225.75 231.28 B: i didn't get that one oh that must have did you end up talking to somebody who did 

226.15 228.59 A: i don't anything about sports 

230.77 233.11 A: yeah unfortunately i 

233.07 235.79 B: you end up listening to somebody who did 

233.30 235.33 A: got a guy that night 

235.60 237.98 A: i got a guy that night 

238.53 240.46 B: oh a guy hm 

240.85 242.13 B: that's funny 

242.55 243.57 B: wow 

244.06 244.85 B: hm 

246.13 252.17 B: i do work i do work for a corporation i work for barnes and noble which i mean i 

251.22 253.06 A: that's pretty big yeah 

252.20 258.66 B: they they're really big and fortunately i'm i'm one of the peons in the company though you know i 

259.24 260.65 B: i don't really 

261.12 273.89 B: although from the peon perspective i definitely do kind of get fed up with their behavior like the changes in policies and stuff like that just 

273.86 282.85 B: i mean i've worked there for three and a half years and like every few months something happens that just in my opinion makes me think that they 

282.90 286.38 B: respect and value their employees less and less 

287.16 292.06 A: well you know the more people there are out of work the easier it is for them to hire people and fire them 

291.58 296.60 B: yeah yeah absolutely although you know that the strange thing about barnes and noble is that 

296.68 299.52 B: i don't think they fire people 

300.27 304.52 B: in in all the time that i've worked there i've seen them fire one person 

304.57 308.51 B: and that was because she just coming to work drunk 

308.82 311.18 A: well that's a good reason 

310.10 323.09 B: that is a great reason to fire somebody but it took that sort of extreme you know i mean people who like who steal and are late constantly and bring their personal lives 

322.52 323.59 A: yeah 

323.03 329.32 B: with them every day it's i mean it doesn't really seem to matter to them they just 

330.03 332.18 B: (( i don't know but at the same time )) 

332.41 336.77 B: they want to cut our hours but still hire people 

337.31 338.77 A: yeah [mn] 

338.58 344.33 B: and i mean i know it's cheaper and it's cheaper to have more part-time people without benefits 

342.57 347.08 A: well yeah because then you don't have to have to give them the healthcare and all that 

346.69 352.67 B: oh but that's i mean then you're not really giving people the incentive to want to work 

352.76 355.17 B: for you at their full potential 

354.92 356.21 A: that's true 

355.70 358.45 B: you know i mean if i worked for a company who 

358.87 362.38 B: who i knew wasn't going to get any benefits like well you know 

362.58 370.80 B: i mean i wouldn't say screw that but i wouldn't i probably wouldn't work as hard as i would for a place who would provide that 

369.44 372.52 A: oh i'd be looking for a place that would give me benefits 

371.12 377.77 B: yeah exactly exactly i mean that would definitely not be the kind of place i would want to stay for any length of time 

380.28 381.45 B: (( i don't know )) 

380.85 383.26 A: yeah 

382.56 384.24 B: well how is your business 

384.39 385.36 A: um 

385.79 386.82 A: bad 

386.63 387.81 B: bad 

386.97 388.99 A: really really bad 

388.42 389.63 B: is it is it 

389.70 391.90 B: is it the war or is it just 

391.28 392.72 A: no just 

392.99 396.09 A: i picked a bad time to get into the computer field a 

395.50 397.31 B: oh how how long have you had it 

397.03 398.38 A: couple of years 

398.73 400.71 A: and it you know just just 

400.16 402.80 B: do you think you waited too late or 

402.35 403.85 A: no [mn] 

402.94 404.31 B: (( too early )) 

405.09 409.65 A: just it just coincided with all the all the stuff that happened you know 

408.86 410.05 B: (( hm )) 

410.44 411.45 A: and 

412.39 415.97 A: just haven't been able to really get things rolling the way i'd like to 

418.19 422.42 A: but i have confidence that it'll work eventually 

422.01 424.57 B: oh that's good i mean you're not giving up that's 

424.16 425.12 A: (( no )) 

426.91 429.37 B: that's the kind of thing they want us to do 

429.54 434.06 B: i think to cave in to corporate america let the corporations do it 

434.01 436.68 A: no i think there has to be a mix 

436.84 442.40 B: i absolutely agree i'd eventually like to have my own business as well i'm only forty three years old 

440.43 444.65 A: i mean there are things that there are some things that big business do better 

444.99 446.58 B: yeah that's true 

446.17 448.01 A: and there are some things that 

448.11 450.55 A: really belong to a small business you know 

448.16 451.66 B: they can't do it all yeah yeah there i mean 

451.97 456.29 A: and where are you gonna get innovation if you don't have small businesses 

455.72 456.80 B: mhm 

457.82 461.50 B: did you go to school for it for that or did you learn through 

459.75 460.71 A: no 

460.75 465.19 A: no i just kind of held my noise and jumped off the high board 

464.32 467.84 B: [laughter] oh really what kind of training do you have 

465.51 466.46 A: yeah 

467.32 471.49 A: um well i taught myself how to web page design and some 

472.78 475.72 A: code stuff and just you know 

475.89 477.10 A: kind of wung it 

476.91 477.90 B: yeah 

478.57 482.41 B: i kind of have a tendency to stay away from computers i 

481.95 485.02 A: well i was an electronics technician before 

484.94 486.04 B: (( uh )) 

485.22 488.97 A: i'm semi i was sort of semi retired but uh
