135.45 145.64 B: you know i can see that they have you know a good relationship and it's kind of you know just an unspoken thing that you see one compensating for the other 

146.15 149.41 B: and you know and even if something 

149.44 157.94 B: you know seems maybe a little weird or whatever they they put up with because the most important thing to them is that they love the other person

160.87 163.86 A: i i i agree that you have to 

164.91 169.66 A: to to love the other person and and i think you also have to like them because

190.24 191.20 B: (( know )) 

191.81 203.11 B: that pretty soon that person is the only one that really looks good to you and you know it it may not be that it would be looking good to everyone else 

203.34 208.21 B: but to you that's the only one you know that that you find 

208.59 212.85 B: attractive or you know you would be attracted to 

213.75 216.52 B: i've found this more and more i think you know

236.42 243.22 B: you know really matter how much money a person has although you know money problems seem to tend to 

243.96 246.88 B: drop a relationship sometimes but 

246.92 253.80 B: you know i feel as i'm a lot happier than a lot of friends who are lot wealthier than i 

255.06 255.93 B: so 

256.44 257.60 B: but i 

256.45 257.40 A: (( well we )) 

257.65 258.60 B: i know 

257.66 258.44 A: we have 

258.55 261.86 A: lots of friends that are that are wealthy but 

258.82 259.84 B: go ahead 

262.09 262.93 A: (( you know )) 

263.41 265.53 A: there aren't very many of them that 

265.85 267.25 A: are as happy 

267.40 268.30 B: no 

267.41 268.69 A: i don't think 

270.77 272.63 B: um i i'm just 

273.15 278.05 B: i i don't know i [cough] i i think that you know when two people 

278.06 281.21 B: kind of feel that their relationship is unique 

281.92 288.81 B: you know then it makes it it kinda maybe just makes it all all complete 

289.68 294.47 A: yeah we've got five kids and the oldest is is almost thirty 

290.02 290.82 B: (( yeah )) 

294.71 295.84 A: and 

296.35 299.81 A: the youngest is fourteen and only one of them's married 

299.83 301.91 A: but all of them tend to 

302.18 307.04 A: like uh the oldest is married and he's been married almost three years now 

307.13 308.13 A: (( and he )) 

309.77 313.39 A: this is the like the second person he ever dated 

313.32 315.21 B: that's nice 

314.14 318.97 A: he didn't date and none of the other children have have done that they've had one or two 

319.61 324.21 A: boyfriends or girlfriends they they tend to stick to the same the same partner 

324.67 327.67 A: and i you know i was complaining to 

327.99 329.37 A: the oldest 

329.43 330.48 A: about 

331.13 332.47 A: you know one of the 

332.99 338.36 A: younger one's boyfriends or girlfriends i don't remember which and they you know and i go 

338.38 345.10 A: well you know he just he spends all his time with her you know they just they're just always together and he goes 

345.17 354.46 A: yeah i go don't all that that's just ridiculous you should be dating around you should be out looking for somebody and he goes well mum look at our example [laughter] you know you you 

355.13 360.42 A: all met you were almost like the first people you ever dated and you got married and you're still married 

361.00 364.71 A: so i think it's a good example to to stay married 

364.83 366.94 A: unless there's a really bad reason 

366.98 371.41 B: yeah i well there's no reason you know if a relationship is 

371.82 385.37 B: deteriorating one person you know to i mean that's no reason to stay with it but you know of course i think a lot of people just refuse to um work things out you know they get too stubborn 

385.68 390.23 B: and they you know and and and it takes two 

390.41 404.86 B: so it really isn't like absolutely one person's fault all the time you know 'cause myself i'm divorced and i really thought it was my husband you know his fault 

405.61 413.98 B: but after we were divorced i seemed to have been able to look back and see that i wasn't i could done things a lot differently too 

414.73 415.64 B: (( so )) 

416.68 421.10 B: i and and it's good if a person doesn't um you 

421.28 422.47 B: know when they 

422.69 426.29 B: do leave a relationship like that that they don't leave 

426.44 429.46 B: just blame the other person because 

429.55 440.81 B: usually they're not going to let it go and you run into these people every day that you know they've been divorced ten and twenty years and they still rant about their ex spouse 

441.11 444.86 B: those are people i kind of try to avoid to avoid 

443.58 444.24 A: oh 

445.18 446.95 A: [laughter] yeah 

445.50 452.06 B: because i mean it's just it's it is not helping anybody by listening to them 

452.58 457.38 B: and going on and they're feeling sorry for themselves they're viewing themselves as the victim 

458.39 470.23 B: but you know i admire when you know like when we get together to plan our class reunion a lot of the couples in there you know they were went to school together and they've been married since then 

470.31 479.50 B: and i think that's i think it's it's really nice it doesn't unfortunately happen to everyone but i i really admire those people 

481.43 482.56 A: (( yeah it )) 

483.10 489.50 A: it's it's strange and hardly any of the the people we went to to college with are still married 

489.69 491.01 A: the couples 

490.86 491.85 B: hm 

492.06 496.04 A: and we're still friends with with most of 'em you know separately 

496.61 497.42 A: but 

498.19 508.09 A: i get tired of hearing them rant and rave i mean i'm like hey it's been twenty years get over it you know you've been remarried twice why are you still taking about them [laughter] 

503.04 503.88 B: yeah 

506.64 519.89 B: i know and you know and and obviously that person isn't happy where they are at in life now is because they wouldn't be at that spot that's what i figure i wouldn't be where i am today 

519.90 526.61 B: if i were still you know in that relationship so you know i learn from it and i moved on 

527.19 530.26 B: and i i consider myself 

530.76 531.78 B: (( you know )) 

532.15 541.20 B: pretty well adjusted but i i i know a lot of people that i work with and that i went to school and they just 

540.98 550.79 B: have not been able to get over something like that and i think that that probably might reflect something that was wrong in their relationship you know when they 

550.91 554.80 B: have an attitude like that too they probably weren't willing to 

555.69 557.12 B: to uh you know 

558.97 562.26 B: take into consideration the other person a lot 

563.06 564.32 B: (( it's just all )) 

564.39 566.60 B: (( me me me i suppose )) 

567.15 569.99 A: yeah i see that attitude a lot that 

570.15 571.59 A: the me me me 

571.69 573.52 A: i mean my husband is a a 

571.74 572.59 B: (( yeah )) 

574.13 581.28 A: [mn] computer person but he also he's uh a musician and he has a degree in music and so he plays music 

581.79 586.52 A: he goes and he plays and he practices with his friends and he plays in a couple of bands 

586.68 589.47 A: and i see some of the other wives of the 

589.84 592.66 A: and even husbands of the other musicians 

593.22 597.01 A: oh they just spend so much time practicing oh blah blah blah blah and it's like
