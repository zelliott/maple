0.00 0.94 B: hello 

0.70 2.70 A: hi my name is anne 

2.16 3.66 B: my name is jenny 

3.41 6.39 A: hi jenny do you want to go first 

6.09 11.43 B: ah sure i prefer well it's it's a mix but i prefer to eat out in a restaurant 

11.90 13.62 B: because they serve you 

13.96 19.30 B: and um i'm always on the go and i rarely get a chance to cook for myself 

20.55 21.94 B: is that what the question was 

21.72 22.99 A: i think so 

22.57 23.52 B: okay 

23.02 35.85 A: um i actually um i prefer to eat in a restaurant part of the time because i like to eat things that i wouldn't be able to make myself because they're too complicated or 

32.48 34.12 B: right 

36.09 39.39 A: um too elaborate to prepare easily at home 

39.44 47.13 A: but i actually really like to cook so i also really like to eat at home as well so it's kind of a toss up for me 

44.56 56.42 B: sure [sigh] i do too it's it's a very tough question to ask because most people like both but if i had to make the choice since i don't have a lot of time usually i would like even though i eat at home most of the times 

56.44 58.56 B: i wouldn't mind a good cooked meal 

59.13 61.62 B: and that you could usually find in a restaurant [laughter] 

61.47 75.67 A: yeah i mean i really like french food so i en- enjoy things that have sauces that take like seven or eight hours to make [sigh] but you know i've tried at home a couple of times and just don't have the patience or fortitude [laughter] to actually 

73.28 74.52 B: to do it 

75.15 78.81 B: sometimes i just don't even have the talent too like g- good mexican food 

78.84 81.83 B: i'd rather get out than make myself 

81.72 84.55 A: or i guess like chinese restaurants 

84.30 85.65 B: also this 

84.75 95.10 A: they can get the the wok so hot l- on a professional stove much hotter than you can get it at home so you can't make it taste the same at home 

94.40 101.60 B: i was just going to say there's no way i can make as well as i can make a stir fry i can't make it taste the same as i can get from a chinese restaurant [sigh] 

100.45 109.86 A: exactly or the same with like a professional pizza oven [laughter] [laughter] i would love a professional pizza oven in my house [laughter] 

103.70 105.64 B: well that's true [sigh] true 

108.42 115.25 B: [laughter] but on the other hand if it's other italian foods since i'm italian i really rarely will eat out 

115.33 121.48 B: besides pizza you have to have pizza out um because just they don't have the same taste to me 

121.72 126.46 B: it depends you know you have to find a really really good italian restaurant and then usually you're paying 

126.57 129.38 B: the money for it when you could just make it at home 

127.67 128.63 A: (( yeah that's )) 

129.17 139.03 A: yeah that's true and i mean definitely um some things i think are better at home like i don't like pie crust in restaurants 

139.13 141.71 A: i don't know what it is but it never 

141.44 142.60 B: tastes the same 

141.76 144.84 A: tastes like the same as home made to me 

143.09 146.64 B: but see if you can if you can make a good pie crust 

147.53 151.53 B: i i don't think i can i haven't had much luck with that 

149.31 150.38 A: yeah i lo- 

150.77 152.43 A: i love to make pie 

152.22 153.69 B: oh so you're a baker 

153.32 162.56 A: yeah i love to bake so and i think you know people usually like my crusts and it ta- like somehow it gets flakier to me the ones in 

163.12 168.30 A: restaurants all taste like i don't know like like the pilfery frozen crusts that you buy 

164.65 165.63 B: do they have 

167.25 171.06 B: yeah i was going they have more does it seem like they have more lard in them or 

171.27 173.14 A: (( i don't know if it's even )) 

172.11 174.19 B: they seem heavier for some reason 

173.46 176.94 A: it yeah it's definitely heavier it's thicker 

177.01 181.90 A: and it's more like cookie like than pastry like to me 

182.19 187.59 A: like mine is i mean it's not like puff pastry but it's kind of got more that flaky puff pastry 

186.79 188.27 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

187.88 189.58 A: feel to it 

189.74 190.64 B: now 

189.92 192.23 A: which i really like [laughter] 

192.32 196.88 B: now there are cert- you know it all depends on the restaurant you go to or it depends on the bakery you go to 

196.92 200.27 B: that you can make your preferences but if it was any old restaurant 

200.46 203.13 B: you know it depends on you know the question 

203.24 210.29 A: right in general i would rather eat at home but if i could pick like a great restaurant it would be out definitely [laughter] 

208.28 214.85 B: that right if i had time to cook the things that i like to cook then it would be in home 

215.13 217.36 B: but if i have to you know if 

217.41 219.04 B: i want a good meal 

219.12 221.38 B: and i don't have the time it would have to be the restaurant 

221.19 230.33 A: also i have a baby so it's kind of hard to take a baby out to eat a lot where [laughter] it's much easier at home to keep her occupied 

224.19 225.13 B: (( out )) 

228.30 236.15 B: and i really yeah i really trying to stay away from fast food so it would have to be a restaurant restaurant [sigh] but we do like to go for breakfast a 

236.41 240.57 A: ooh breakfast is my favorite meal i like to eat breakfast for dinner too 

237.18 238.67 B: (( lot )) 

239.51 252.05 B: yeah so do i if i had a choice i'd ra- i usually get it at lunchtime you know or later in the day but um we have twenty four hour restaurants by us and that's what we usually do is go for breakfast at any time of the day 

251.85 257.33 A: oh that's great breakfast like late at night after you've been out is the best too 

256.31 261.75 B: yeah sometimes we go like two three in the morning we'll go to a late show then we'll go to an all night restaurant 

261.79 264.37 B: and eat breakfast [laughter] 

263.98 266.89 A: we never get to do that anymore [laughter] 

265.32 267.71 B: i bet you don't how old is your child 

267.41 269.40 A: she's eighteen months old 

268.56 270.80 B: eighteen months old how sweet 

269.99 276.41 A: yes so she's wonderful but yes no no more super late nights out for me [laughter] [laughter] 

271.08 272.13 B: (( now i have )) 

275.18 283.56 B: [laughter] well they'll come again i i have fifteen nieces and nephews and um my sisters that's who i usually go with so they find they find time 

281.59 282.69 A: wow 

283.68 285.66 B: you know t- take turns or 

285.76 298.38 B: the husbands watch them that's why it's usually late night 'cause once the kids are asleep then we can go out and so you definitely want and after a long day you definitely want someone to serve you coffee that's another reason why i like restaurants 

291.54 292.66 A: right 

298.42 302.22 B: 'cause i like coffee and they just keep pouring it in and pouring it in [laughter] 

302.27 303.07 B: or 

302.32 313.18 A: i like coffee but i don't drink very much of it for me it's like a little treat i'll get myself a starbuck's like when i'm out and i need a pick me up but i don't drink coffee every day 

312.56 315.54 B: oh mine's daily it's morning noon and night 

315.09 316.77 A: [laughter] 

315.81 318.93 B: it's it's like relaxes me for some reason [laughter] 

318.64 327.19 A: but yeah there's something about coffee like starbuck's coffee or good coffee out that's so much better than coffee you can make at home 

327.12 330.19 B: yeah i i spent a lot of money out but 

328.08 334.54 A: well i don't have any i don't have an espresso maker so i'm sure that would make part of the difference but even so 

333.31 340.54 B: then again it's a hassle it's so much easier to go in and give a couple of dollars and you get what you want than to have to try to make it where 

340.60 344.30 B: especially in an espresso maker where like you can get the right flavor and everything 

344.28 349.14 A: yeah it's so good [laughter] ooh now i want coffee [laughter] 

348.50 351.48 B: [laughter] well you're going to have to make yourself one or go out 

351.30 355.53 A: i guess so my baby's napping so i'll have to wait 'til she wakes up [sigh] 

355.94 357.24 B: but um 

357.52 360.03 B: [lipsmack] just trying to think about restaurants again 

359.26 363.61 A: what other ki- what kind of foods do you not like to eat out besides italian 

363.82 364.82 B: (( ah )) 

364.94 375.33 B: i you know i'm pretty much open for anything i have never been to like a sushi bar or anything like that i'm not like i have cousins that try every kind of restaurant there is 

375.35 383.53 B: i've tried like thai food and different you know indian foods greek food is you know they're all those are all okay they're an occasional thing 

383.25 384.25 A: mhm 

383.87 385.13 B: but um 

385.62 394.19 B: so i wouldn't choose a restaurant if it was like ethnic in that way but any family restaurant i do like and like i said mexican chinese 

393.77 400.34 A: you should go try japanese food you can get things other than sushi some japanese food is so amazing 

399.71 401.26 B: is it really good 

400.53 403.08 A: yes it's really really good 

402.43 410.07 B: you know if i have someone to go like if i have someone daring or someone says oh i know this restaurant or they're having this festival then i usually will go and try something 

409.88 417.98 A: sometimes we go to um japanese restaurants that have what they call the teppan tables where they cook the food in front of you 

416.02 417.50 B: cook it right in front of you 

417.66 419.47 B: (( i always wanted to do that )) 

418.44 430.26 A: and that is so fun and it tastes again that's something you can never ever ever make it taste that way at home my husband loves that kind of food and we'll go 

422.42 424.43 B: that got to be kinda like a 

425.20 426.10 B: right 

429.20 433.80 B: that's what i was going to say gotta kinda gotta be like a special night or a date night kind of a thing 

430.33 431.11 A: and 

433.29 435.04 A: exactly we 

434.15 435.96 B: where you can really enjoy it 

435.31 438.52 A: we last went there on new year's eve 

438.58 446.98 A: with some friends and we like rolled out of there because we ate so much but it's so good and again you just cannot match that flavor 

446.20 448.00 B: what area are you in 

447.68 449.66 A: um i'm in southern california 

448.99 450.76 B: southern california i'm in chicago 

450.75 457.93 A: ah b- i'm sure they have teppan restaurants in chicago i'm sure they have like a benny honner which is the big chain that has that 

453.32 454.69 B: yeah i'm sure 

455.50 463.88 B: they do they definitely do they actually i almost had a chance to take a i'm a teacher i had a chance to take a group of students but i let someone else take them go with them 

463.67 472.20 A: you should go some night because it's really mainstream it's not it's not scary it's not sushi it's not raw if you like like thai food you will like it 

471.53 477.37 B: yeah i i think i would i just gave up my one opportunity [laughter] maybe my other opportunity will come 

473.34 476.19 A: um chicago has [laughter] 

477.21 479.74 A: well you have to go on a date or something 

479.24 482.26 B: yeah it has to be something like that where it's a special night 

480.93 483.28 A: or somebody's birthday or 

482.32 489.25 B: right where you're going to take them out but that's always why f- you'd i'd rather like for s- for birthdays we always go out to eat 

489.62 499.36 B: we just you know it's kinda go choose a restaurant the whoever the person's favorite restaurant and try to do that it seems like more special than because we do cook at home all the time 

499.22 500.38 A: right 

499.72 508.89 B: you know so that makes it more special so for special occasions when you're you know things are quick or you want to meet somebody eating out is always 

509.26 510.48 B: my preference 

510.63 513.70 B: then you don't have to clean the house too to have guests over [laughter] [sigh] 

512.96 521.52 A: that's absolutely true [laughter] yeah we we usually end up with a couple of special occasion restaurants that we go to 

521.84 527.89 A: ah for things usually usually like they're either japanese or french usually 

528.07 529.48 A: so 'cause again 

529.52 538.48 A: french food i- it's just so hard to recreate at home where you know good like american style family style food barbeque 

533.85 534.71 B: right 

538.58 542.28 A: i can come pretty close at home to creating 

542.77 545.96 A: you know almost anything i can eat out like that 

542.85 544.13 B: there you know it's 

544.96 559.68 B: that's to say i think there's certain like regular american type foods or things that you can't get out like i make like chicken and dumplings and everyone's like they'll never order it out because it's like you know the old country buffet might have it but it's not like really real food 

559.27 563.26 A: yeah m- not moist and i love chicken and dumplings 

562.55 568.16 B: yeah it's like the home made and you can't beat the home made certain things you can't beat home made you know 

565.42 566.71 A: well like i made 

567.97 574.16 A: yeah i made pot roast last night and that's kind of one that i wouldn't ever order pot roast out 

568.36 569.81 B: but it's more american 

572.17 586.80 B: you wouldn't order out yes and i i can make a really good roast we have a i have a recipe where you put like a consume in there and a can of beer and um these hot peppers and that's when it's cooking it just like gets all the flavor in there and it's like 

585.51 587.52 A: that sounds good 

586.85 592.98 B: and you can't no it's you ca- i would never order that out either so there are certain things that you have to have home cooked 

593.80 598.00 B: but again [sigh] i do like those restaurants [sigh] 

597.65 599.89 A: oh yeah do you have a favorite restaurant
