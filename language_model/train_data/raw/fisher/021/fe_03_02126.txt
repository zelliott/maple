96.24 99.01 A: [sigh] yeah i would say that most of my 

99.13 112.27 A: adult friends that i'm [noise] still really close with are from work too which is really interesting [mn] um [mn] i don't really well i keep in touch with a couple of people still from high school and i tend to kinda lose touch with them 

109.81 110.69 B: uh-huh 

112.13 117.21 A: and then find them again after a couple of years [laughter] and then lose touch with them and find them again [noise] [mn] 

116.16 124.35 B: right yeah as a matter of fact a friend of mine who i used to kind of get holiday cards from and i used to keep in touch with 

124.44 135.13 B: i've just lost touch with and i don't have her phone number and it's funny because you ever check out that um em- oh no website called classmates 

134.60 135.70 A: oh yeah 

135.36 144.53 B: yeah so i saw her on there she's listed on there and i listed my name but you have to subscribe to the service i guess you pay 

144.28 145.72 A: oh no 

144.30 155.02 B: a premium or something to get her email but i'm considering doing it just to get in touch with her plus ah it's it would be my twenty five year reunion 

150.29 151.41 A: yeah 

155.14 169.94 B: [cough] this year and i really wanted to see if they were gonna do a reunion and i haven't heard anything about it and i was trying to find out you know on the internet whether there was anything planned and i haven't seen anything anywhere 

155.28 156.28 A: (( wow [noise] )) 

165.61 166.44 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

169.85 170.87 A: uh-huh 

169.87 175.62 B: and ah i thought that would have been really cool to meet up with some of these people 

175.61 178.24 A: i know it would be [laughter] 

177.68 181.38 B: [laughter] are you still living in the same area where you grew up 

181.32 185.76 A: no actually i grew up in washington in seattle [sigh] 

184.74 187.73 B: oh okay so that's a big distance 

187.16 189.36 A: yeah yeah and um 

188.14 189.11 B: mhm 

189.36 202.95 A: actually the people that i still keep in touch with from high school don't live in seattle any more either so i i don't every really get the opportunity to see them which is a shame [sigh] and then i actually just moved to kansas um back in september 

197.62 198.64 B: uh-huh 

202.36 204.19 B: that's a big change huh 

203.53 206.80 A: so yeah very big [laughter] 

205.94 210.63 B: i my cousins lived in kansas for a while they lived in lawrence 

210.17 218.56 A: oh okay yeah lawrence is a little bit better actually than manhattan [laughter] so [laughter] yeah [laughter] but [lipsmack] yeah [mn] 

213.09 215.68 B: oh is it [laughter] 

216.91 224.83 B: yeah they l- they lived there i guess for about five years they m- moved around a lot 'cause my uncle was a contractor 

224.95 229.59 B: and he used to build ah [lipsmack] like roads and 

229.29 230.56 A: oh okay 

229.70 236.19 B: homes and things like that so he was always taking these jobs in different places so like 

235.13 236.26 A: and he that must 

237.13 237.98 B: (( huh [sigh] )) 

237.84 240.44 A: that must have been interesting for the family [laughter] 

239.62 249.24 B: yeah yes and no right you know i mean i i don't think i would've liked being uprooted like that i mean i grew up in new york 

241.60 242.32 A: (( [sigh] )) 

245.51 246.83 A: yeah 

249.03 249.96 A: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

249.16 261.43 B: i mean the only big move that we made was from jersey when i was five and then the rest of the time has been spent in queens new york and i've just never left queens new york 

254.11 255.45 A: oh wow [sigh] 

261.14 263.17 A: (( wow but )) 

262.13 264.25 B: (( so but no go ahead )) 

264.04 272.32 A: do you think that it's easier for you to keep in touch with people because you kind of grew up there and you're all still in the same place like are do most of your friends 

272.50 276.53 A: like who you met there still live there or have people moved away [lipsmack] [noise] 

275.76 287.93 B: i don't think it is really that easier because i yeah i think people have gone elsewhere and you just kind of change you know you change your direction and where you're going so 

287.04 288.50 A: yeah 

287.80 294.78 B: you i really haven't kept in touch with those people you know except for like the two friends that i have from high school 

294.43 296.20 A: yeah 

294.77 306.32 B: like just um they moved out to long island and you know we've just kinda like kept us they m- they wound up getting married and um you know we just kept in touch um 

306.28 320.07 B: [mn] but the rest of them i really have no idea you know and even though i'm still in queens i think some days like maybe i'll run into somebody but i really don't [laughter] so [mn] 

309.88 311.60 A: [sigh] yeah 

316.33 327.54 A: doesn't happen [laughter] i think you know that's interesting because i would say like 'cause a lot of the people that i keep in touch with now especially like email has made such a difference in the number of 

327.12 328.40 B: right 

327.75 331.42 A: [lipsmack] um kind of a- close acquaintances that i keep in touch with 

330.81 331.70 B: true 

331.52 337.21 A: um and i would say like there are people that i keep in touch with that you know i met when i lived in seattle 

336.83 337.94 B: mhm 

337.47 349.94 A: [sigh] and i w- don't necessarily have all that much in common with them any more but it's not that hard to kinda send them an email every once in a while and still keep in touch that way whereas i think if i was actually living there we probably wouldn't 

341.88 342.89 B: right 

345.26 346.35 B: right 

349.94 358.10 A: keep in touch because we would have to always make excuses why we weren't seeing each other and things like that [sigh] so i think that probably makes it a little easier 

350.57 351.58 B: yeah 

354.18 355.65 B: right right 

357.53 359.91 B: yeah it definitely does my email 

359.90 374.58 B: address list keeps growing and growing [laughter] and it's so easy to just you know pass on a you know a joke or a poem or you know something and you know just kinda like keep in touch that way [noise] 

362.46 363.34 A: (( [noise] mine do- )) 

364.15 364.96 A: [laughter] 

369.29 370.52 A: yeah 

373.90 382.04 A: i know it's so nice i did some travelling um while i was in college actually and it was really interesting because um 

378.98 379.94 B: mhm 

381.96 382.57 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

382.34 391.86 A: i went back i probably travelled about five years after that again and the first time i went travelling [sigh] nobody ha- i mean a few people had email addresses but not many at all 

391.64 395.65 A: and i don't keep in touch with anybody that i met on that trip b yeah 

395.30 396.19 B: (( mhm )) 

395.43 408.33 A: and then five years later i went back and travelled some more and i met [sigh] you know the same amount of people but then all of a sudden every body had email addresses and i k- still keep in touch with you know [noise] probably fifteen or twenty people in other countries that 

402.67 403.67 B: right 

405.28 406.19 B: yeah 

408.14 411.13 A: i just wouldn't if i didn't have email [laughter] so 

410.02 413.15 B: (( yeah that's interesting it's really interesting it's brilliant the thing )) 

411.46 414.73 A: [laughter] it's made a huge difference [sigh] [noise] 

413.59 427.89 B: yeah well um we're considering relocating now me and my husband [cough] because we have a baby and [sigh] you know we just want to have ah him grow up in a different kind of environment 'cause 

422.88 423.51 A: [mn] 

427.26 428.41 A: yeah 

428.03 441.84 B: queens is nice but you know like to get into a good school you really wanna get into a private school it's very expensive and housing is very expensive here so we're thinking about going down to florida and 

435.47 436.65 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

441.08 441.73 A: oh 

441.90 449.80 B: something that's kinda preventing us from doing that though is the fact that we have friends and close ties here 

449.64 452.16 B: and you know it it would mean 

451.94 460.58 B: making new friends you know and and both of us have kind of like you know we've both grown up in new york we've never lived outside of new york so we're kinda like 

453.64 454.66 A: yeah 

460.36 474.85 B: afraid to make that move but at the same time we know it's like you gotta grow up [laughter] you know and you have to sometimes make these choices and you know [mn] that i think that's probably gonna happen within the next year mhm 

465.15 467.48 A: yeah i know [laughter] 

474.88 483.70 A: is that yeah that i mean that is hard because my husband and i we actually just got married this last summer and then moved out here to kansas and it's really 

483.78 498.34 A: hard to make friends kinda the older you get it seems you know it's like when you're in high school or college or whatever you're kind of with these larger groups of the people and you all have something major in common and and it's just [sigh] i don't know it's really interest- 

486.98 488.03 B: yeah 

491.88 492.93 B: right 

494.13 495.02 B: right 

496.61 499.01 B: yeah you have to find something that 

499.13 505.72 B: ah mutually ties you into somebody like if you have a child it's easier because you meet other mothers 

503.15 507.24 A: [sigh] yeah yeah 

505.99 509.38 B: you know in play groups and things like that um 

508.82 514.25 A: yeah that's true and around here i mean it's very like conservative mid west and 

513.82 514.80 B: uh-huh 

514.01 524.14 A: you know a lot of people are very religious and so church is a major like place for people to go and socialize in my husband and i neither of us are religious like we don't attend church so 

518.68 519.76 B: right 

521.95 523.16 B: (( oh i see )) 

523.27 524.19 B: yeah 

524.18 526.68 A: so i can see you know because there is another 

526.46 535.62 A: co-worker of my husband's that moved here at the same time with her husband and they attend church and you know that kinda gives you like a little automatic social life around here and 

529.70 530.62 B: yeah 

531.28 532.14 B: right 

533.48 534.39 B: yeah 

535.38 547.15 A: and besides that besides kind of the university and [mn] you know religion there's not a whole lot going on around here it's not like you can go out and sign up for a class at night 'cause there just aren't any so 

542.61 543.55 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

544.13 545.08 B: right 

546.76 558.21 B: well something that my husband and i have [cough] that i'm gonna just confide to you because i don't know who you are and you're never going to see me ag- talk to me again [laughter] is that we're both in a._a. 

547.51 548.36 A: like 

555.79 557.69 A: right [laughter] 

558.11 559.25 A: oh okay 

558.22 564.32 B: and that's how we met and um so we know that wherever we go there's going to be an a._a. meeting 

564.25 567.26 B: so we always meet people 

567.09 568.38 A: yeah 

567.18 572.84 B: and we know that if we went down to florida that we would immediately meet a group of people 

572.65 582.44 B: who would open their arms and kinda like just welcome us you know so that's kinda like an advantage to being an alcoholic [laughter] 

575.89 576.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

577.97 579.49 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

580.40 592.42 A: [laughter] that's a very like positive spin on that i've never ever though of that advantage but that is nice [laughter] and i guess it's kinda good motivation to keep attending the meetings and things like that too [laughter] 

583.28 586.14 B: [laughter] yeah right [laughter] 

586.45 587.32 B: [laughter] 

591.31 593.03 B: yeah it is it is 

593.08 594.15 B: um 

593.21 594.40 A: wow 

594.30 599.89 B: [lipsmack] so that's kinda like an incentive you know for us to move is that we know that we'll always
