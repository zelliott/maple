403.40 404.15 A: (( you know )) 

404.46 418.12 A: [sigh] on the other end of things sometimes things just aren't going right and you know you got the you got the three people that called off and nobody'll come in to work for you and [sigh] you know and that's no excuse for you know bad service or anything but sometimes things happen but 

416.55 417.55 B: (( run one yeah )) 

418.44 421.73 B: [mn] yeah so what would your idea of a perfect meal be [laughter] 

421.05 425.21 A: my idea of a perfect meal is [laughter] is where [sigh] 

425.21 439.70 A: whether it be at home or going out where you can sit down and enjoy it and everything turns out nice you know what i mean and it's something that you wanted to order versus like well we're kinda on a tight budget tonight type thing like say you went out to ah 

432.05 432.83 B: yeah 

439.69 449.93 A: i don't know what you got out there but [sigh] you go to one of these restaurants and you just be able to order whatever the heck you want off the menu or or or just go out shopping for you know 

445.83 446.71 B: yeah 

449.73 456.31 A: kinda have no spending limits you know like i i i prefer s- ah steak and lobster are my two favorite things [sigh] 

455.40 456.50 B: yeah 

456.49 458.20 A: so if i can go out and buy a 

458.66 467.96 A: buy a big old lobster tail and a and a and and a porterhouse steak or something and make a huge meal out of it for like me and my wife or something that would be perfect 

467.57 468.78 B: yeah 

468.24 479.24 A: and then what would top it off is if everything turned out you know sometimes when you buy lobster and stuff you get a bad one you know and [sigh] sometimes when you trying to trying to make a a perfect meal 

479.50 484.54 A: your lobster tail will be bad or something and that kinda ruins the whole idea you know what i 

481.71 482.53 B: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

485.85 499.16 A: mean mm [noise] or if you go out and you know like you said get you get bad service or something that kinda ruins the whole thing when when it all just kind of flows and [sigh] the meal just kind of stuffs you up and [sigh] you're you're all happy about it you know 

498.98 499.82 B: yeah 

500.19 502.11 B: i think a combination of that and like 

502.24 510.86 B: oh i've had like you know the meal was like kinda whatever but like the fact that the family was there and like the conversation kind of overcame 

511.02 513.54 B: whatever might have gone wrong with the food that's always like 

514.31 515.75 B: kind of puts the 

516.51 518.48 B: the whole meal experience in 

518.61 522.46 B: i don't know it makes it a good meal even though like maybe the food wasn't the greatest 

521.62 526.81 A: yeah even though wh- yeah i i can see what you're saying yeah it'd be cool [cough] 

525.92 532.86 B: yeah well 'cause i remember like what was it last thanksgiving i made like a huge spread and then like nobody talked and it was like okay what was the point [laughter] mhm yeah i 

532.28 537.18 A: [laughter] atmosphere wasn't there huh 

537.55 538.62 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

539.25 541.20 A: well i can understand that too 

542.70 544.68 B: don't know kind of a combination of 

545.43 547.56 B: everything that makes it a good meal [sigh] 

551.28 557.77 B: i don't know i'm kind of wondering what the subjects will be tomorrow [laughter] i i'm wondering if food's going to be another subject on 

553.84 555.33 A: [sigh] what's that 

558.41 559.89 B: to talk about 

559.67 561.40 A: oh when you make these phone calls 

561.10 562.20 B: yeah 

562.69 568.01 A: this is the second one i did it's kinda hard for me to not get distracted because my kids are like dra-
