17.12 18.92 A: (( yeah )) 

19.74 23.37 A: yes uh this is uh bob in florida 

22.18 24.44 B: (( you are where are you in florida )) 

24.04 26.72 A: uh in pompano beach 

26.13 27.37 B: i'm in ocala 

27.08 28.34 A: okay 

28.00 33.60 B: (( okay well no i'll take the other side of the issue i'd rather uh eat at home yes well uh because i feel the food will be better )) 

33.42 35.66 A: (( food okay i'd )) 

35.85 38.36 A: (( much prefer to eat in a )) 

37.68 40.62 B: (( prepared uh nowadays most everything is done on a fast food basis even )) 

38.82 46.38 A: (( restaurant how 'bout you [laughter] )) 

46.39 47.40 A: (( oh )) 

48.21 50.29 A: (( really why )) 

50.01 51.24 B: (( in a restaurant right )) 

50.57 61.11 A: and um i'm more interested in nutrition uh than i am in um the taste of the food 

60.05 63.48 B: oh okay well the selection as far as nutritional 

63.52 66.32 B: value is better if you cook at home 

66.48 74.83 B: and i you know but as far as sanitary i mean you can restaurants are pretty strict as far as you know sanitary conditions 

74.10 83.64 A: yeah except now with this uh this sars situation i wouldn't want somebody coughing over the food or anything like that and um 

83.55 89.53 A: uh having uh owned a commissary um it was very difficult always to uh 

89.49 99.02 A: um get the people to wash their hands after any number of activities uh for example something slips on the floor and somebody picks it up 

98.79 104.94 A: uh now at home um i was always taught that you immediately went and washed your hands 

104.80 116.99 A: thoroughly uh before you would touch an- any other object in the kitchen or at the dinner table so uh i'm not sure that everybody obeys that so therefore i'm uh 

110.40 111.33 B: right 

116.90 124.08 A: more conscious of that having also uh owned the commissary um in florida like you i know what the uh 

124.00 138.76 A: uh the it's a restaurant and hotel commission they come in and they they do uh um examine and uh inspect constantly and uh but their rules are are still pretty liberal 

133.79 134.99 B: mhm 

138.69 143.57 A: and uh i know uh having run a commissary um 

143.79 148.30 A: that there are ways to get around uh some of those issues and i know in a restaurant 

148.24 159.08 A: um business when people are in a hurry and uh they're working on tips and so forth like that i would imagine um haste i- is is more 

159.09 164.90 A: of their mind than it would be to uh uh stop and wash their hands uh so on and so 

163.98 164.82 B: (( mhm )) 

164.87 177.15 B: that's probably right i do wonder too about you know like on buffets there's things under light you know i think there's some sort of rule as to how long you can keep food under lights and i wonder you know 

175.97 186.13 A: forth well uh yes i've always had a problem i- if i uh at church we have a buffet 

177.43 180.50 B: if they really follow that pretty rigidly 

185.99 192.18 A: and if it's during the flu season two or three days later i will have some minor uh 

192.09 199.17 A: uh symptom of the of th- the flu whether and i know that it's just because people have uh 

194.99 196.39 B: oh 

199.09 209.74 A: touched the food maybe touched their nose or shaken hands with somebody else and then touched uh something that that has to do with the preparation of the food now 

209.96 215.01 A: out in a restaurant where there's a buffet you notice that they do have the 

214.95 228.20 A: the glass shield at an angle over the food so that people can't uh inadvertently sneeze or cough or or something uh so that the food is better prep- er 

216.44 217.40 B: right 

228.35 232.80 A: stays more sanitary but it's still a problem isn't it 

231.27 234.14 B: right yeah well how 'bout um 

234.37 245.51 B: food that like hot food like fried chicken underneath those lights i mean chicken is a big source of like salmonella you know and how long can you 

241.18 242.57 A: [laughter] 

242.64 245.06 A: absolutely yeah 

245.65 250.19 B: you know are they under restriction as to how long they can keep that food out 

250.17 260.95 A: i don't think so but of course the longer they keep it out under the heat the less the salmonella i i i would imagine because i'm not no i'm not sure of my statement on that i don't know 

261.00 261.94 A: whether 

262.08 276.41 A: salmonella incubates under after some well see supposedly the premise would be it would be thoroughly co- cooked to begin with so that the salmonella wouldn't be there when you uh put the heat lamp on but 

269.82 270.83 B: right 

274.66 277.87 B: and is the heat sufficient enough though to you know 

277.87 287.17 A: but you see nowadays we realize science realizes that anything that's heated over a hundred and eighteen degrees i believe it is 

286.11 287.53 B: mhm 

287.90 293.97 A: oh see boiling point is er one twelve no i'm wrong it's a hundred and eight degrees 

293.37 294.66 B: mhm 

294.34 297.81 A: uh under er see wat- water boils at 

297.68 301.47 A: no no water boils at two hundred and twelve degrees doesn't it yep 

300.61 301.96 B: right right 

301.33 304.24 A: i'm totally wrong it is a hundred and eighteen degrees 

304.24 317.39 A: all right yeah anything over a hundred and eighteen degrees you begin to lose all the the real nutrient value in the food because the enzymes in the food are the things that make it um 

310.98 312.28 B: oh 

317.71 321.18 A: oh being very simple about it nutritious 

321.02 335.46 A: to the body um and it's just like taking vitamins and minerals which i take by the handful but science says that if it isn't in its natural form with the with the enzymes 

322.27 323.14 B: (( really ooh right mm )) 

335.29 347.10 A: you probably aren't going to absorb it oh and if you do er it's not going to be um of a nutritious nature so um it's i eat two 

345.79 347.92 B: you mean an adequate amount of it 

347.77 350.51 A: meals a day where i don't cook 

350.07 351.03 B: oh 

350.72 357.37 A: uh but on the third meal i succumb to tradition and and palate er perhaps and then 

357.21 360.71 A: uh w- will cook but i try now 

360.54 365.95 A: i live in a small apartment and uh for a while the only thing i had was a microwave well 

364.97 366.37 B: mhm 

365.73 375.68 A: uh i realize now that uh [laughter] like like in england they're all concerned about the d._n._a. and the irradiated food well of course a microwave 

375.71 390.31 A: uh is a very dangerous piece of equipment wi- ra- that irradiates and of course the newer ones are supposedly have a better um window uh no what's the word i want opening yeah what do you call that thing that opens and closes 

390.40 399.20 A: on a microwave the door yeah a better door uh so that the radiation doesn't come through so uh 

390.95 393.26 B: the door you mean yeah 

399.17 407.45 A: but what is happening to the food it's all the enzymes and all the aspects of it are under this microwave 

406.96 407.54 B: (( mm )) 

408.00 418.32 A: and there again [sigh] we're changing the substance of the food the molecular action molecular restructure of the food and and what it whether there's any nutrition in it oh it's cooked 

418.47 420.13 A: but then again 

420.46 421.56 A: um 

421.85 426.74 A: when you're out in a restaurant how do you know how much of it is microwaved 

426.77 435.61 B: well that's true too i guess you know the word sterilize really [laughter] would m- mean stripped of everything [laughter] 

433.70 443.83 A: right and of course you being you being a woman uh you- you've cooked all your life and so to you being able to go out and have somebody um um 

442.23 445.87 B: right wait on me is a luxury right 

443.98 457.42 A: yeah it's an absolute positively uh -tival luxury right and uh i understand that and i'm being a bachelor and cooking uh for myself um i guess i would have the same 

457.56 465.15 A: desire but then again um when i look at what we're getting nowadays when we're out um 

465.30 473.85 A: and i'm more interested in good health see being aged seventy one and still exercising twice a day and still you know 

473.97 475.20 B: wonderful 

474.78 485.20 A: yeah so therefore i've realized that food is [laughter] more than just the uh the opportunity to have somebody else prepare it 

484.98 485.90 B: right 

485.23 486.34 A: um 

486.74 498.16 A: yes i would like to have a maid [laughter] but i'm sure she'd she'd want to cook it her way and and uh we'd have a breakdown in in um relationship [laughter] 

489.00 490.46 B: [laughter] 

497.57 500.45 B: (( [laughter] )) 

498.06 503.70 A: very quickly [laughter] [laughter] 

501.05 512.94 B: [laughter] i i guess the bottom line is is just going out to eat is just a luxury it's really not the most nutritional or healthy way to go because it's all loaded with fat you know that 

510.03 511.83 A: but you can't 

512.75 522.44 A: yeah fat makes something sweet and and very palatable and and tasteful and and of course now science has realized that uh there are good fats and bad fats and uh 

521.63 529.33 B: right now blooming onion is definitely not a good fat [laughter] [laughter] 

525.28 533.73 A: [laughter] right so uh and and most the time when you go to these restaurants um 

533.86 542.55 A: the whole menu is predicated on how quickly they can serve it and get it to you so it's a pretty fast food entry 

542.11 543.26 B: yeah 

542.81 550.40 A: and um remember the old days the old fashioned restaurants uh where it was like a home cooked meal 

549.81 550.86 B: oh yeah 

550.72 563.61 A: and uh and uh my goodness a roast a roast lamb or something like that it it takes only a very high caliber restaurant today that would do something like that 

562.05 564.81 B: would even tackle something like that you know 

563.78 566.38 A: right and uh so 

565.77 569.64 B: and when they cooked your eggs right in front of you and [laughter] things like that 

569.49 577.84 A: yes yes and eggs now eggs are very healthy they've come uh a hundred and eighty degrees on that eggs are uh 

570.05 571.02 B: you know 

573.76 574.74 B: mhm 

577.16 580.22 B: isn't that the truth [laughter] 

578.64 579.46 A: (( ya )) 

579.49 582.75 A: butter butter is is very good for you 

582.15 583.67 B: mhm 

583.06 587.65 A: and of course um then of course the olive oil 

587.31 588.56 B: mhm 

587.84 596.04 A: and other safflower oil and the uh even the coconut oil um the reason that coconut oil was labelled so 

596.82 599.89 A: got such a bad reputation is when they
