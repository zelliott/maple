57.11 63.02 A: okay i have i i'm more of i'm not very good at meeting people [laughter] as you can tell by this conversation 

61.54 62.31 B: oh 

63.05 76.99 A: so i have a very a few close friends um i have a lot of acquaintances people that i work with but i consider a friend someone who i can depend on you know regardless of what the situation is if i call them i have a problem 

72.62 73.58 B: mhm 

76.98 84.16 A: then i'd call one of my friends because i know that they're going to be there to to help me with the situation um 

83.61 85.06 B: (( mhm right )) 

84.69 93.22 A: and like i said i i'm not real good at at meeting new people or i'm a friendly person i'm just not good at meeting people in the beginning 

94.28 107.57 B: [mn] yeah uh i'm ex- i'm outgoing and all that people kinda think i'm a little crazy but i just i'm just who i am and i don't really care [laughter] what other people think um i'm sixteen 

107.73 108.60 B: so 

108.98 111.78 B: uh i don't know if that has something to do with it [laughter] 

111.71 116.97 A: [laughter] oh i don't know [laughter] i'd say you know as you get older 'cause i'm older 

113.82 115.26 B: [laughter] 

116.80 131.37 A: [laughter] that that things change but i think i was like this when i was sixteen i had a lot of you know i had my close knit friends i knew a lot of people when i was in high school but there was a certain group of us that hung together 

116.98 119.26 B: [laughter] yes [laughter] 

125.13 126.14 B: mhm 

131.21 137.39 A: and um i would consider them my friends even to this day these people are still considered my friends 

137.25 138.46 B: (( [sigh] wow )) 

137.36 151.18 A: and you make these you know lasting relationships even though you've gone your separate ways and you may not see each other for quite a while but it it's good that when you do get back together you can just pick up where you left off 

151.07 153.70 A: and continue on with your friendship 

151.24 152.17 B: mhm 

153.33 160.09 B: wow that would be really ni- i hope i still have my friends that i have now when i get older that'd be nice 

159.71 168.06 A: yeah and so that's why pick your friends now wisely [laughter] 'cause they may be ones that you have to depend on you know at a later date mhm 

166.32 167.33 B: right 

168.72 176.13 B: yeah i i guess i haven't m- some of my friends i guess they can depend more upon me than i can on them but 

176.16 177.20 B: hello 

177.40 179.63 B: (( that's i guess that's just how it goes )) 

179.80 181.26 B: sometimes they're just 

181.80 182.99 B: whatever 

183.18 185.99 B: i'd be there for 'em if they needed something 

186.03 191.39 B: and i guess they'd try to be there for me some of 'em can't drive so that's kind of hard 

190.61 191.31 A: yes 

191.70 193.50 A: do you do you drive 

193.22 194.57 B: yes i drive 

194.31 197.03 A: do and do you have a car that you can drive 

196.74 198.80 B: yes [laughter] 

198.02 203.84 A: [laughter] [laughter] so i guess that makes it easier on your friends though [laughter] that you make because you do have a car 

201.54 202.71 B: (( i do )) 

203.55 209.37 B: exactly it's more beneficial for them and you know come pick me up and i'm like great 

206.53 208.12 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

209.82 210.68 B: fun 

211.26 212.31 B: um 

212.48 226.71 B: yeah talk about my friends okay well i used to go to a private school so i have more girlfriends than i do guy friends but now i go to a public school so i've kind of started getting more guy friends and 

225.93 231.76 A: so how was that transition for you from going from and i take it you went to an all girl private school 

231.40 232.72 B: (( yes )) 

232.51 234.07 A: (( to now a mixed [laughter] )) 

232.73 233.76 B: it was 

234.32 236.44 B: really hard [laughter] 

236.76 243.82 B: i didn't think it was going to be that hard but it was pretty hard because i it was a total change i was in culture shock 

243.90 247.85 B: extreme it was just really bad um 

248.19 251.96 B: i'm going back to my [laughter] private school because i just 

252.00 257.22 B: 'cause public school's too different for me i guess and i just 

257.49 260.58 B: i miss my friends at my my other school 

260.84 262.94 B: and yeah 

263.28 265.44 A: so you're sixteen are you a sophomore 

263.48 264.53 B: i don't 

265.36 266.38 B: yes 

266.52 269.53 A: and did you go to private school all this time 

268.69 275.39 B: i we- pretty much for nine years i went to a private school so that's where [laughter] i've grown up and that's where everyone 

275.88 277.19 B: (( i know is )) 

278.26 281.79 A: that it would make a difference then if that's what you were used 

278.33 279.34 B: there 

281.96 288.56 A: to and now going out and entering out into the public school realm i asked that question my daughter is in private school right now 

288.31 289.82 B: (( oh yeah )) 

288.93 295.35 A: and um but not an all girls school it it is mixed but even she the thought of her going to 

295.40 300.36 A: a public school is like ooh i don't want to go to public school [laughter] 

299.06 300.93 B: exactly 

301.36 302.57 A: (( and i you know )) 

301.56 302.54 B: (( i did )) 

302.73 315.13 B: yeah it takes a certain type of person no oh okay i'm sorry it takes a certain type of person to like be able to go to a private school and then to change over to a public school it's just hard 

303.32 303.99 A: i 

304.07 305.40 A: (( go ahead i'm sorry )) 

305.94 306.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

307.58 308.59 A: (( that's okay [laughter] )) 

316.04 317.67 B: too hard 

317.22 323.14 A: well i guess my husband and i we think it's kinda funny 'cause both of us grew up in public schools that was all we knew 

322.62 323.85 B: mhm 

323.18 324.75 A: (( you know so um )) 

324.93 329.40 A: to us public school is like okay you know it's all right but 

327.82 328.82 B: mhm 

329.16 330.16 B: right 

329.66 333.96 A: to her it's a horror [laughter] you know it's a nightmare waiting to happen to her 

331.36 332.83 B: [laughter] 

332.88 335.08 B: [laughter] yes 

334.64 335.61 A: (( so um )) 

336.56 341.94 A: so now i guess i'll be a little more understanding since i've talked to somebody else [laughter] [sigh] 

340.64 342.52 B: exactly [laughter] 

343.76 348.19 B: um shoot okay more about my friends friends friends 

349.17 352.95 B: there's not a lot to say about my friends for ten minutes about my friends 

351.78 352.96 A: [laughter] 

353.10 354.30 B: um 

354.21 359.79 A: well the the most important thing i can say is you know do pick them wisely now 

359.71 361.16 B: (( mhm )) 

360.12 363.96 A: and um you know one because it'll keep you out of trouble too you know 

363.49 365.89 B: right that's my problem 

364.31 365.35 A: but then 

365.60 369.75 A: you are talking about you know possibly some lasting friendships 

369.69 370.71 B: mhm 

370.38 382.53 A: and um so you want to choose your friends wisely the ones that you're going to know when you're forty or forty five you know [laughter] and you you're looking for a group to go out and go cruising with or something on a cruise ship 

377.28 378.15 B: right 

381.44 382.57 B: mhm 

382.84 385.66 A: so you you want to just pick your friends wisely 

386.54 392.44 B: wow i don't know if i could stand some of my friends for a whole cruise i'd probably end up killing some of them 

390.04 391.39 A: [laughter] 

392.10 400.18 A: (( [laughter] well that's because they're sixteen now too right [laughter] so wait until they get a little bit older [laughter] okay and maybe they'll change [laughter] )) 

395.53 397.47 B: exactly [laughter] 

399.55 401.43 B: [laughter] hopefully 

401.63 402.56 B: yeah 

402.76 405.19 B: they would need to change [laughter] a lot 

404.98 410.83 A: [laughter] well i think we all do we all do some growing up we all do some maturing and 

410.12 411.18 B: mhm 

410.86 425.19 A: um you know and and actually when you get out in the workforce it's going to be similar to the way it is in school the only difference is in the workforce you're doing it for your livelihood in school you're just doing it for convenience you know to have a social life 

423.57 424.49 B: right 

425.22 437.62 A: but um it's basically the same thing just like in school you find you know good people to hang out with and then there's some bad people that hang out to hang out with and there's those that like you and do- and those that don't 

437.50 438.47 B: mhm 

437.73 445.03 A: and when you enter the workforce it'll be the same way there's some good people in the office to hang out with and there's some not [laughter] so good people and 

444.24 445.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

445.63 446.57 A: yeah 

446.75 450.79 A: so um i i think it all equals out in the end 

450.64 452.66 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

453.94 458.00 B: yeah wow i'd never really thought [laughter] about it like that i 

458.22 460.58 B: mean i guess i did but i didn't really 

461.04 465.61 B: i didn't think about working i guess i don't really think about that a lot 

465.92 466.78 B: (( the work )) 

465.95 470.69 A: and then too when you're sixteen there's a lot of things as far as life goes that 

470.79 471.91 B: mhm 

470.87 484.94 A: you know we just take for granted that it's going to happen and you know eventually one day i'll graduate from high school with these friends and some of those friends may go off to college with you and they may even influence [laughter] the college that you choose to go to 

484.86 486.07 B: right 

485.36 489.98 A: you know 'cause you want to take some of your friends with you and some of them you're going to go oh no i 

487.72 488.76 B: mhm 

489.99 492.55 A: i want to get as far away from them [laughter] as possible [laughter] 

491.55 494.94 B: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

494.71 508.84 A: [laughter] and then you'll go down and you'll meet some new friends and then some of your old friends and i have an older daughter too so [laughter] this ki- this kind of boils into it you find out that you know even if you do go off to college with some of your friends 

501.59 503.08 B: (( oh yes [mn] )) 

508.68 523.53 A: that once you get down there they may change because now they're in a different environment they're away from their parents you know and a lot of things that they couldn't do when they were at home and they had some restrictions and some constraints they no longer have now 

523.34 524.34 B: right 

523.45 525.04 A: and people change 

525.85 527.75 A: so you just have to be careful [noise] 

527.52 528.59 B: mhm 

530.07 537.63 B: my friends oh goodness that'd be bad my friends [laughter] without any restraints on them i don't scared what they might do 

535.35 537.11 A: [laughter] 

537.28 538.53 A: (( [laughter] well )) 

538.63 539.41 B: (( [laughter] )) 

540.08 544.51 A: hopefully they've they've had some good upbringing and they'll all be good [laughter] 

544.09 545.95 B: mhm [noise] 

545.98 547.19 B: um 

547.37 554.11 B: i don't really have a varying in age with my friends i don't think they're mostly like my age 

554.21 562.08 B: and like maybe seniors would be like the oldest friends i have um do you have any older friends 

561.73 563.29 A: mhm oh yes 

563.11 564.22 B: okay 

563.93 573.20 A: but see what happens is after [laughter] after you become an adult [laughter] and actually get out here and get older age changes age isn't 

568.05 569.00 B: mhm 

573.29 576.18 A: looked at the same way it is when you're younger 

576.44 577.37 A: um 

577.54 579.80 A: you know it's like right now you 

579.81 581.27 A: you're a junior right 

581.41 583.04 B: a sophomore sophomore 

582.23 591.52 A: i'm sorry a sophomore okay so you wouldn't imagine hanging out with someone who was maybe in the seventh or eighth grade 

591.38 593.35 B: right [laughter] no way 

592.04 599.95 A: you know spending [laughter] spending the weekend at the mall or whatever and when you think about it age wise they may be only three years younger th-
