1.19 2.38 A: hello 

2.04 3.31 B: hi i'm zoe 

3.35 4.81 A: hi i'm lynn 

4.41 5.48 B: hi lynn 

5.85 11.27 A: uh this is funny because this i i've only done this once but that was what my call was last time 

8.94 9.96 B: yeah 

10.72 12.33 B: (( oh no you have the same thing )) 

12.36 13.95 A: really yeah 

13.38 14.84 B: that's funny 

14.26 17.72 A: so i don't know if i'm supposed to do it again i i'll just do it again it's 

16.63 19.45 B: oh do it again [laughter] 

19.09 24.20 A: (( [laughter] so um you go first since i've already done this [laughter] [noise] )) 

22.17 28.36 B: okay [laughter] well it's funny 'cause when the first part of the question said do you have lots of friends and acquaintances or do you only 

28.52 29.66 B: i 

30.24 39.52 B: i guess i i kind of have split between like i have a lot of friends who i'll kind of keep updated about like the major things in my life 

39.14 40.10 A: uh-huh 

39.60 40.70 B: um 

41.76 47.06 B: [lipsmack] but i've i'm young and i've moved a couple of times since college 

47.01 51.11 B: so there's sort of like a couple of different groups of friends in different places 

47.32 48.42 A: how old are you 

49.75 50.59 A: uh-huh 

50.63 51.71 A: right 

51.06 65.07 B: and i keep in touch with them to varying degrees but there's like really two or three friends who i just no matter where i go i really sort of stay in touch and every time i talk to them feel very close and connected with them and um 

65.77 69.33 B: and then whenever i move the people who 

70.47 83.59 B: the people who like you know are in my neighborhood or or who i hung out with um where i was living i don't necessarily keep in total touch with them once i leave so i guess so i guess i have you know a bunch of people who 

80.12 81.08 A: right 

83.51 97.02 B: you know i know pretty well and if i'm there living in the same place [laughter] as them a lot i'll i'll see them a lot and they'll know what's going on in my life but then you know something changes and shifts and i don't necessarily keep in touch with them afterwards 

97.43 98.13 A: hm 

97.84 99.79 B: so that's sort of what i what i'm like 

100.18 101.98 A: [noise] um i 

102.03 108.59 A: am i'm a little bit older than you obviously but i um i've lived in this same area for my whole life 

108.18 109.13 B: uh-huh 

108.88 120.64 A: so i like have i have the most wonderful friends in the whole world and people i've been friends for for a long time uh my my son is a senior in high school this year 

116.57 117.97 B: yeah 

119.88 121.19 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

120.63 127.59 A: and he is actually one of his friends is the son of one of my friends from high school 

126.83 129.03 B: oh wow that's incredible 

127.98 142.22 A: and so i mean and i have actually and my best friend from high school just lives not far from me and we actually lost touch for a few years but what was so weird was when we when we finally did talk it was like we never missed a beat 

134.26 135.25 B: uh-huh 

141.73 142.67 B: right 

142.37 153.38 A: so the the people [sigh] i mean i have a lot of different degrees of friends but i feel very blessed in that department it was interesting that they would pick that subject for me because 

152.69 153.72 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

153.47 161.51 A: um i i always tell people i have the best friends in the whole world not just people that like are acquaintances that [sigh] you know you 

161.67 163.08 A: i mean i'm talking 

163.33 177.93 A: deep serious friends that would do anything in the world for me and have and and the same with me so i feel but then i have you know casual acquaint work people work acquaintances but it seems like every time that i've changed jobs 

164.84 165.87 B: (( yes )) 

167.91 168.95 B: yeah 

173.44 175.01 B: right right 

178.10 181.51 A: um and i'm forty one so i've had several jobs 

179.48 180.37 B: uh-huh 

181.43 187.06 A: but it's like i carry at least one friend [laughter] that i still talk to so 

183.76 184.81 B: (( yeah huh )) 

186.86 190.94 A: i'm i'm a very talkative chatty person and i usually seem to make friends 

188.96 189.91 B: uh-huh 

190.71 203.11 A: but i think being uh the last lady i talked to said she said i think it's 'cause you've lived in the same area for so long 'cause it's easier to keep you know you run into people yeah you even run into people but like now i was trying to think when you were talking about moving 

197.25 199.35 B: keep keep in touch yeah 

202.70 203.57 B: right 

203.62 215.27 A: if i moved now i you know i still have a tremendous amount of friends that i feel like i would keep in you know pretty close contact with and would still know but it's hard you know if you move around and 

211.39 212.49 B: right 

214.49 215.71 B: yeah 

215.71 225.03 A: um then and then when you have kids too you know you bond more with the parents and it just happens to be cool that it's girl a girl that i went to school with you know 

219.72 221.21 B: that's true yeah 

223.97 225.78 B: yeah 

225.15 226.90 A: so you know 

225.94 227.39 B: that's really neat 

227.34 229.48 A: yeah that is pretty cool where do you live 

227.73 228.74 B: yeah 

229.15 230.75 B: i live in philadelphia 

230.71 232.71 A: oh wow i live in texas 

231.25 234.88 B: where do you live texas i was figuring so but 

232.89 234.03 A: (( yeah 'cause you pr- )) 

234.31 236.58 A: (( yeah [laughter] i figured you could probably tell )) 

234.99 244.00 B: i don't i don't know i haven't been i've never been really south of washington d._c. so i i can't tell by people's accents what part of the country they're from at all 

242.96 246.70 A: really most most of the time texas is a dead giveaway 

246.38 251.55 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah yeah yeah 

246.91 254.82 A: [laughter] you know other than that you know i guess i just knew you were somewhere different than texas [laughter] 

253.10 256.03 B: right right right right right yeah 

255.05 261.89 A: well so you did you just sign up to do this have you this is a kind of a new thing i'm i was just thinking okay i can do this 

261.42 268.28 B: yeah well some friends of mine some friends of mine you know work at u. penn which is where the study's being done 

262.01 263.20 A: [laughter] 

268.03 268.94 A: uh-huh 

268.41 271.14 B: so they sort of hear about the studies whenever there's a study 

271.35 275.06 B: and so some one of my friends just emailed me about it yeah 

271.45 272.82 A: and they let you know 

274.24 279.01 A: see and now i i was unemployed at one point and it's been over two years ago 

278.87 284.63 A: and a girl used to send me these she said well this'd be something that you could do that you know give you extra cash in the meantime 

284.43 295.65 A: and i don't do very many but when i got this one i was like okay i can talk to people this is cool and i hang up and i go inside i just made ten bucks okay this is great you know 

289.21 290.54 B: exactly

293.99 295.09 B: yeah 

295.21 296.54 B: yeah it's fun

296.81 298.56 B: yeah yeah 

299.06 306.70 B: right it was interesting to hear you talking about your friend from high school because i've actually spoke to my best friend from high school this afternoon 

306.75 309.87 B: and i like grew up in boston [lipsmack] 

310.72 314.63 A: oh you did see i worked for fidelity in our corporate offices here yeah

314.92 316.69 A: do you know anybody that works for fidelity 

316.00 325.38 B: no i don't no i don't but i so i grew up in that area and then my best friend moved when she went to college she went to canada she went to toronto 

318.14 318.82 A: (( yeah )) 

325.24 326.33 A: oh wow 

325.62 328.39 B: and when i went to college i went to philadelphia 

328.59 338.42 B: and we so you know it was ha- it was pre- kind of hard to keep in touch we kept in touch pretty well during college but not that well and these days we try and ta- you know 

336.14 337.10 A: right 

338.70 346.01 B: she you know we on- we're not we're not neither of us are that great at keeping in touch but we'll talk every you know couple of months at least 

346.22 349.43 A: well see yeah my my best friend from high school that i was telling you 

349.29 362.75 A: we lived by each other we lived near each other uh for several years but it wasn't until our reunion that we kind of got back in contact and then it was just like we ne- and it was like oh my gosh we've lived this close for all this long 

353.46 354.40 B: yeah 

357.31 358.52 B: yeah 

361.78 362.69 B: right 

362.64 371.92 A: 'cause her kids are a little bit younger i just have one son and she's got three girls and so you know you you know when you're doing the parent thing you kinda get involved with the parents of

371.54 372.49 B: yeah 

371.84 383.23 A: your age group of kids more more like but i i could call her today and we'd talk for hours and it would be like yeah remember in you know from high school and you're like yeah yeah you know [laughter] 

372.89 373.97 B: yeah 

374.50 375.44 B: yeah 

382.74 385.28 B: right the same energy's still there 

383.62 384.47 A: (( and that's )) 

384.57 386.28 A: that's really cool 

385.64 386.78 B: yeah 

386.14 399.76 A: and even you know [sigh] i'm very blessed and i almost think i'm bragging but i do really have wonderful friends but i think even if you have just one person that you can do that with that you're still you're just as blessed 

392.44 393.64 B: that's great 

396.02 397.11 B: yep 

397.90 398.74 B: (( yeah )) 

399.13 400.55 B: yeah yeah i have 

399.81 410.63 A: because some people don't connect with you know they just don't seem to you know you've got to have one you've got to have somebody somewhere i don't care if they're on the other side of the world that you can just totally be you 

401.36 403.27 B: that's true mhm 

404.68 405.48 B: yeah 

410.19 412.72 B: that's right that's right yeah 

411.38 414.78 A: and and you should always have that everybody [laughter] should 

414.22 418.00 B: i feel i feel lucky that i do i have people like that it's funny because 

418.02 423.49 B: in you know both times that i've moved and started you know [mn] meeting new people 

424.28 429.36 B: i you know just it's it's incredible how you meet the right people it just sort of happens you know 

427.70 428.61 A: (( yeah )) 

428.82 436.48 A: yes well it's like you just attract the chemistry it's like it's like meeting uh you know a guy it's like it's still it's a chemistry thing 

429.42 430.76 B: and uh 

431.28 432.41 B: yeah 

433.77 435.37 B: right exactly 

435.63 436.55 B: right 

436.48 437.37 B: right 

437.31 438.80 B: yeah so i so 

438.69 453.42 B: it's and it's kind of fun too when i'm in a new when i've you know i've been living where i'm living right now for two years now but i'm still search figuring out who are the people that i really want to get to know better but it's really neat to no- to notice that when i first 

453.47 460.70 B: you know meet somebody for the first time like you know i can kind of really tell okay like here's somebody that i really want to you know try and connect with more 

456.90 458.30 A: yeah right off 

460.51 462.22 A: right yeah 

461.09 468.67 B: but it's so interesting because you know some when when you move somebody who move you know who's new to this area some of some of the folks who 

469.07 470.77 B: [lipsmack] i want to get to know 

470.93 479.91 B: um have been living in this neighborhood for a while when they went to college they were living in this neighborhood or whatever and all their friends they know from school and um 

480.45 489.35 B: so it's sort of interesting to see how new friends how certain people are open to new friends in their lives more than others yeah or just you know 

486.68 488.47 A: and other people aren't yeah 

488.58 490.91 A: (( yeah some people are very private )) 

490.28 492.08 B: yeah yeah 

491.12 503.84 A: i mean like to me it would panic me to move to a new place just because i've lived here all my life but i can tell you that it wouldn't take me long to meet people just because of you know i just seem to meet people very easy 

495.99 496.98 B: sure 

503.23 504.13 B: right 

503.76 514.43 A: but you know i i have friends even that you know are just they're more private than our than i am you know and i always say and they're okay with that you see i i think my sec- part of my security
