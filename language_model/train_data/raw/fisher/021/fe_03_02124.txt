0.00 1.24 A: [laughter] hello 

0.85 2.47 B: (( hi i'm rachel )) 

2.21 3.54 A: hi rachel i'm jay 

3.12 4.01 B: hi 

4.30 5.04 B: um 

5.03 10.16 A: so ah do we keep introducing or do we start talking 

5.49 6.05 B: (( [mn] )) 

9.07 11.43 B: we might as well start talking i guess and 

10.77 14.84 A: all right so ah so i i guess the question again was ah 

15.20 19.74 A: [cough] t- w- about your friends right [laughter] 

17.26 18.21 B: (( yeah )) 

19.25 20.48 B: (( [sigh] )) 

20.51 21.65 A: (( so ah )) 

21.73 24.10 A: do you have more than ten friends 

24.36 26.18 B: well i think 

26.28 36.62 B: i'm a college student right now and in high school i was definitely the type to have just a few friends but in college i have a lot more friends which i think is a function of the type my my particular college 

36.68 38.54 A: (( [noise] what what kind of college do you go to )) 

37.91 42.27 B: um it's a small liberal arts college but it seems to attract [sigh] 

42.45 43.17 B: um 

43.25 44.11 B: (( i don't know )) 

44.24 46.22 B: people who can be my friends 

46.44 47.46 A: (( ah )) 

47.39 48.11 B: so 

48.25 51.58 B: that's kind of neat but i think in general i'm a few close friends person 

48.36 49.41 A: um 

53.01 55.91 A: [mn] i think i think it's tougher as you get older too 

55.94 59.24 A: like like i'm i'm i'm in graduate school so 

59.62 60.79 A: [mn] i think as 

61.82 62.88 A: (( [sigh] )) 

63.42 66.18 A: maybe that's not necessarily true but it's 

66.41 70.57 A: yo- you f- fi- you tend to find your f- friends through different environments 

69.85 70.66 B: mhm 

70.59 80.81 A: where i think where you're in high school and and to some extent college though in i think college it starts to choose especially high school you're sort of just kind of dealing with the people around you 

80.68 87.36 A: that sort of end up being your friends but you you get a lot more chance to pick and choose the older you get 

82.42 83.85 B: yeah 

89.96 94.54 A: mm it's a good question i'm not sure so who who's your -s your best friend go to your college right now 

94.85 98.80 B: i don't know um best friend is an interesting like 

98.93 109.04 B: when i was little i had someone i considered a best friend and like [sigh] i guess i still when i think of best friends think of her even though i'm m- more or less out of touch with her 

108.93 109.90 A: uh-huh 

109.23 114.04 B: now um but putting anyone else in that category it's kind of difficult 

114.08 119.92 B: but i think my closest friends go to college yeah in general how about you 

120.20 126.86 A: um i think i would say i [sigh] well it's kinda tough because [mn] i'm about to get married actually in a couple of months [noise] 

126.10 128.08 B: oh congratulations [sigh] 

127.12 129.37 A: oh thanks [cough] and um 

129.74 137.36 A: i think [mn] i mean my best man is going to be a guy that i've known for years and years but we we probably only talk once every 

137.91 139.55 A: couple of months maybe 

139.52 140.97 B: oh that's not too bad 

139.83 146.97 A: i've known him for about ten years and then but i guess to some extent i consider my him my best friend because [sigh] 

141.72 142.95 B: mhm 

147.53 150.07 A: he's seen me sort of go through 

150.52 159.77 A: so much um he can he can relate to a lot of my past experiences whereas some of my newer friends don't really know me from [mn] from either college or 

156.93 157.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

159.83 162.69 A: working at a camp or the peace corps or whatever so 

163.01 164.87 A: it's kinda 

165.70 174.92 A: i i don't think necessarily that that [mn] a best friend is s- necessarily gets the most contact 

174.21 176.00 B: right no definitely not 

174.94 176.15 A: yeah 

176.90 183.08 A: and then i've got another guy who's going to be another best man and just 'cause i have a lot of contact with him and 

184.06 194.83 A: [mn] i i guess i kind of know him w- know him pretty well [mn] but he kinda he kinda gets on gets on my nerves [laughter] but ah 

195.29 197.19 A: i don't know it's ah 

198.42 204.45 A: [noise] i i think i think i'm sort of probably more his best friend than he's my best friend but i know that that's important to him 

202.49 203.28 B: (( mm [sigh] )) 

203.74 204.99 B: (( mm yeah )) 

204.72 205.73 A: (( and so )) 

207.02 219.94 A: that's that's an interesting thing [noise] um and in fact right now we have some friends who are over who are we're helping them make wedding invitations for their upcoming wedding yeah we make paper so we're 

216.90 218.01 B: oh nice 

220.14 221.16 B: oh cool 

220.72 223.34 A: [sigh] making paper yeah and 

226.01 232.44 A: ah but it i think one of the harder things is is actually balancing all your f- your friends um 

230.87 231.59 B: (( mm )) 

232.52 243.58 A: and in some ways just kinda you get to a point where you just cut f- certain people off because they're not close enough and i think i think that kinda it goes around like i'm thirty and it's [mn] 

237.50 238.69 B: yeah 

243.51 248.93 A: i think a lot of people do that just after a while you either change groups of friends or you 

249.31 254.06 A: you just nobody seems to have time for anybody because you have so much more going on 

256.15 258.05 A: but um 

259.93 265.18 A: and wait can you hold on one second hey guys a black ford just pulled up outside the 

261.88 262.69 B: sure 

266.50 281.31 A: stoop [noise] [sigh] anyways um we're laughing because there's a we'd ordered chinese food and um about ten minutes later they pulled up again next door and now they just pulled up again to across the street it's really funny [laughter] 

270.37 271.04 B: (( mhm )) 

277.48 278.33 B: oh 

278.47 281.55 B: [laughter] oops [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

281.28 282.11 A: (( [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

282.86 289.40 A: um it's funny though too i think as you get older you tend to you you find functions where you can accommodate more friends 

290.03 291.02 A: so 

290.20 292.63 B: like what do you mean ah sorry functions 

291.16 299.41 A: well it it's like okay for example my fiancee and i we have basically two nights out of the week that we're not either at work or in school 

299.13 299.85 B: (( okay )) 

299.65 312.06 A: and so we tend to get together with some friends because you when obviously you find someone you really like you you get into a relationship you like acquire all their friends so all of a sudden you have to re- sort your time out 

302.87 303.67 B: mhm 

310.29 311.44 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

312.83 313.99 A: (( [laughter] )) 

314.63 315.90 A: and so 

316.07 322.45 A: it's like so we have these gatherings where we like try to accommodate a lot of people at once because we know it's maybe weeks before 

322.53 326.35 A: and not only do you have to like get them together they have to have time for you 

326.34 327.32 B: right 

326.63 327.46 A: so 

327.48 328.83 A: everybody gets a l- 

327.65 329.62 B: yeah coordinating schedules [mn] 

329.06 338.12 A: yeah it's like everyone gets less and less time not only do you have to coordinate your friends' time but as soon as they find a partner then you have to c- coordinate their partner's time as well so it's just like 

338.20 342.77 A: the chances [mn] it just gets harder and harder i think [cough] 

344.25 345.20 A: um 

345.72 352.04 A: and and so how often so when you get together with your friends how many people do you tend to get together with 

351.66 352.50 B: well 

352.85 355.43 B: at college it's pretty informal it's like 

355.70 358.02 B: we all end up at the dining hall at the same time 

358.00 359.24 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

358.45 359.53 B: sort of thing 

359.72 360.56 B: so 

360.64 372.70 B: it varies i mean i think like i definitely have different interactions if i'm with one or one person or two people or a whole big group i tend to be much quieter if i'm out with a big group and i listen more than i talk 

372.73 375.46 B: but if i'm with just a few than i talk more 

372.91 373.81 A: uh-huh 

375.70 376.67 B: (( um [mn] )) 

378.62 384.67 B: yeah so it really it depends i sometimes will invite a lot of people but depending what else is going on 

384.48 388.82 A: [sigh] d- so do you prefer the smaller interactions if you can help it 

385.06 386.26 B: fewer will come 

387.52 389.83 B: i like a a mixture of both 

389.63 390.33 A: (( huh )) 

389.96 390.77 B: um 

390.89 391.90 B: i think 

392.22 393.13 B: but 

395.64 399.05 B: but yeah there is something really nice about the smaller ones 

401.27 406.38 A: yeah there's it's funny my fiancee's ah she's when we're together with friends we ah 

406.47 411.58 A: [mn] have a hard time like if in in larger groups she doesn't get as much 

411.78 413.85 A: input because everyone's 

414.68 425.75 A: [sigh] ah she needs about eight seconds before she'll interject [laughter] eight seconds of ssilence and most people need about six or seven so it's harder for her to 

418.60 419.31 B: mm 

424.37 425.27 B: yeah 

426.24 431.94 B: for me too sometimes this is even if i start talking sometimes someone else will start talking too and they win 

432.29 433.69 B: (( um i'm n- )) 

433.81 438.51 B: not quite sure how that works but [sigh] getting into conversations can be tough 

439.45 442.72 A: yeah that is tough and i think it's it's harder too because when 

442.84 443.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

444.32 453.88 A: a lot of conversation revolves around [noise] like i'm not saying this is true for you but i've noticed it because i teach at the university as well and um [sigh] 

453.95 463.54 A: students tend to when i pay attention to their conversations kind of informally like in the dining hall or whatnot a lot of the conversations start with like kinda me me me [laughter] 

459.35 460.05 B: (( mm )) 

463.68 471.87 A: and so there's there's less of especially with less int- less maybe less intimate friends may- ma- may not be true when 

471.98 474.87 A: [mn] you are already familiar with someone and what's going on in their life but 

474.94 477.76 A: if you [mn] pay attention to conversations 

477.73 489.61 A: uh you might find that people will start something off with something interesting and then someone will interject not about to ask them about what's going on with that but to actually s- 

489.59 504.18 A: to discuss something similar so it's a lot of i'm talking about myself and then you kind of jump in and you say yeah i'm gonna talk about myself too [laughter] and but it's neat 'cause as you get older i think that happens less and less people are less comfortable talking about themselves [laughter] 

491.39 492.88 B: mhm yeah 

496.85 497.77 B: (( yeah mm )) 

503.96 506.23 A: and there is much more questioning going on 

506.51 508.35 B: so what do they talk about 

508.45 516.34 A: what do they talk about a- anything it's like what happened last night oh yeah i got so drunk last night and i i was at this party and then and s- 

509.30 510.30 B: yeah 

515.36 517.88 B: no but when it's i mean when it's not about oneself 

519.31 531.79 A: oh well i think then you tend to respond to what someone else is saying not with [noise] not with a similar situation that resolves around yourself but asking them to expand on that or to like um 

523.28 524.61 B: oh i see okay 

529.27 530.05 B: okay 

532.75 536.12 A: like back tailing which is like mhm yeah uh-huh 

535.32 537.14 B: yeah [laughter] 

536.65 542.34 A: and uh so it's kinda i don't know do do you notice that when with your friends 

542.18 543.03 B: um 

543.15 545.23 A: or certain friends maybe 

545.40 549.49 B: i think that i've been part of both types of conversations 

549.72 554.95 A: [sigh] [noise] oh yeah i don't that you're i don't think it's ever exclusive i think [noise] 

550.11 550.93 B: um 

551.28 552.26 B: i don't [noise] [noise] 

553.27 555.58 B: yeah i guess i think 

558.11 565.85 B: yeah that would be interesting i haven't though about before when when each type shows up if it's with people i know better or 

565.87 568.74 B: less better or who's interacting with whom or 

568.76 571.23 B: why it's working that way that is really interesting though 

568.85 569.72 A: why tha- 

571.43 576.09 A: i i don't think and it's not that some people do and some people don't i think everybody does it 

575.47 576.86 B: right but in different 

576.27 580.50 A: [mn] but but there's just different degrees and it's harder to relate to someone 

577.14 578.37 B: situations 

580.46 592.23 A: who like you you walk away and you know like man they didn't ask me anything about myself [laughter] i or they knew that all this was going on and they didn't they didn't want me to share they just kept sharing theirself 

585.71 586.81 B: (( yes )) 

592.25 593.76 A: and it's kind of if 

594.71 596.12 A: yeah it's 

595.09 597.51 B: talking at each other instead of with 

596.34 599.95 A: yeah it instead of instead of like kind of giv-
