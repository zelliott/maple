16.91 20.89 A: yeah friends a lot of friends and yourself 

20.82 21.72 B: um 

22.06 28.28 B: i since i'm a foreigner it takes a you know a little a while for me to develop friendships so to speak 

27.96 28.98 A: (( oh )) 

28.28 37.87 B: so it's kind of harder and um i've been in this country for over five years but i think it's easier to make friends when you are younger 

32.33 33.30 A: okay 

38.21 42.03 B: and maybe because you're more naive and you kind of forget little things 

41.80 44.43 A: [laughter] 

42.51 46.82 B: [laughter] than when you're getting older and it's getting harder and harder 

46.34 51.14 A: it gets harder and harder right right well in your other country um 

47.53 48.38 B: so 

51.16 56.64 A: you you had friends there right okay and do you still keep in contact with those friends 

52.90 54.08 B: yeah 

55.93 68.17 B: i'm trying to but uh the country's too far away so you know everybody gets busy but i think it's for me it's um easy to kind of you know make an acquaintance but then it's 

59.23 60.43 A: (( oh )) 

60.76 61.71 A: okay 

63.36 64.20 A: mhm 

67.07 67.96 A: mhm 

68.29 76.41 B: it's hard to be a close friend as i understand you know to be a friend is just you know everything pretty much 

70.31 71.24 A: okay 

76.14 77.84 A: everything sometimes 

76.84 85.39 B: and you can yeah you can trust with everything and you can go with um any trouble you have [noise] so that's much harder 

86.27 86.85 A: (( ooh )) 

86.86 87.93 A: well 

88.01 97.88 A: you say friends friends acquaintances good best friend [laughter] a a best friend is like you say is kind of hard 

93.18 94.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

97.28 99.19 B: yeah 

98.32 106.36 A: uh you feel uh uh uh uh how would you say violated i guess a lot when when you say best friends 

106.66 109.42 A: you you know friends sometimes 

106.76 107.61 B: (( uh )) 

110.86 121.98 A: violate your con- confidentiality you understand what i'm saying so is that why it may be hard for you to connect and make friends here here in this country 

113.07 114.04 B: yes 

114.65 115.56 B: yes 

117.41 119.39 B: maybe yeah 

119.84 121.21 B: yeah 

121.68 135.05 B: i think uh you know prior i had some i've i've been burned a few times so now it's very difficult to to just say okay i'm going to trust this person again because you're thinking okay that happened before so 

125.77 127.04 A: exactly 

127.85 128.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

130.83 132.36 A: exactly 

132.46 133.82 A: yeah 

134.90 137.49 A: yeah i mean but on a general 

138.26 139.69 A: uh 

139.77 149.26 A: friend [laughter] they're i guess they're good to have you know because you you'll always need somebody to talk to i guess you know you 

148.86 150.60 B: oh yeah absolutely 

149.85 152.62 A: you know so i don't know if you would 

152.75 156.08 A: categorize that as a friend or 

156.31 158.13 A: or um 

159.09 162.03 A: (( well what would you say [noise] yes )) 

163.14 164.85 B: so i would agree with you 

164.68 167.17 A: okay you're absolutely right 

167.82 169.44 A: oh my 

169.29 170.52 B: are you um 

171.02 179.62 B: do you have a lot of friends that you kind of uh kept from your childhood or um not like from high school or something like that 

179.44 182.60 A: you know at this point in my life i am 

183.00 185.99 A: i'm i i'm looking for i say 

186.29 188.09 A: a change of career 

187.79 188.78 B: okay 

188.63 197.87 A: so my my idea with the change of career i'll i'll surround myself around a whole new setting of people to obtain 

197.89 201.55 A: better friendships that i've had haven't had 

201.18 202.24 B: okay 

201.59 203.19 A: (( yeah so )) 

203.70 210.06 B: okay well that that will be nice i hope you will be able to achieve your um result so to speak 

208.18 209.30 A: right 

209.51 215.42 A: right right right right yeah because uh high school friends everybody you know 

216.16 221.93 A: (( goes their own ways and you know you you you you grow apart )) 

221.88 223.12 B: mhm 

222.44 232.52 A: and so i don't know you try to find somebody that's on the higher level and you know aim towards the ty- same type goals and stuff that you set you know 

232.45 233.91 B: mhm 

233.76 238.92 A: so that you won't get burnt [laughter] you know what i mean yeah exactly so 

235.61 237.33 B: yeah yeah 

238.23 243.40 B: well you've got to be careful but then on the other hand friendship takes a little bit of um 

243.27 254.10 B: sacrifice from yourself so to speak because you gotta you gotta open up because if you don't you'll you'll never become a friend of that person you'll just you know meet each other and say hi and that's it so 

246.88 247.88 A: mhm 

252.69 254.38 A: right right right 

254.38 266.56 B: i don't know i guess um i i i do have um a few close friends in this country so that helps because if i um you know if i do need to talk to somebody i can always give them a call and i know they will listen to me 

260.61 261.63 A: mhm 

266.08 267.90 A: right right right 

267.79 271.41 B: so do you have this kind of friends that you can trust 

269.73 280.93 A: um actually no i don't i don't i don't find that [laughter] no no no 'cause like you say i guess i'm still stuck on the burntness part of of of situation you know 

279.19 280.24 B: oh 

280.75 281.79 B: okay 

280.86 286.97 A: (( you you you you you you you shut off a lot of that i have plenty of friends but then )) 

285.01 285.98 B: mhm 

287.79 291.44 A: [noise] you just you don't take it personal 

291.26 292.26 B: okay 

291.46 299.31 A: there's more on a hi bye level you know you don't want to involve your your feelings and all that old gooky stuff you know what i mean 

298.98 300.35 B: mhm 

299.55 301.28 A: because no 

301.24 308.03 B: what about uh relatives do you um keep a close contact with relatives okay 

305.38 313.44 A: well i have children i have children and i constantly tell them i'm not your friend i'm your mother but on the next note i am your friend 

313.12 314.67 B: [laughter] 

313.49 322.55 A: so that's mainly more where my attention is focused towards the children and watching them uh with their friends and you know 

317.26 317.98 B: okay 

322.19 323.19 B: okay 

322.62 324.29 A: yeah so that's 

323.70 329.29 B: they probably get burned quite a bit and then they'll run to you and say oh my goodness what did you do to me 

327.65 328.76 A: (( they're just )) 

329.01 332.53 A: they're just actually starting to reach that point yes 

331.95 332.90 B: oh 

332.83 335.25 A: yeah what the twins are eight or whatever 

335.29 338.83 A: so uh they're just just starting to reach that point so 

339.45 346.86 A: i'm i'm more sort of focused on who's your friend and what are you doing with your friends you know type thing so 

346.98 350.90 A: yeah i guess that's another reason why i don't focus too much on 

351.02 353.33 A: my friends per se you know 

353.13 354.55 B: mhm 

353.74 360.58 A: yeah because i'm so much involved into the things that their their friends friendships and stuff you know 

358.50 360.06 B: oh well that's good 

360.53 364.24 B: at least i would hope that you would know who their friends are because 

363.14 365.20 A: exactly yeah 

364.36 367.27 B: it's very important to stay out of trouble if 

365.71 367.00 A: yeah 

367.04 373.25 A: exactly their friends mothers call me to ask me have i seen their children 

367.54 369.17 B: um [noise] [noise] 

372.68 376.42 B: oh [noise] oh that's good

383.75 384.85 A: okay 

385.23 386.12 A: okay 

385.47 388.35 B: [noise] [noise] yeah but um 

388.61 392.21 B: i guess it's um it's not your first time is it 

391.49 395.81 A: yeah yeah actually it is actually it is yeah this is the first time 

392.25 393.42 B: (( oh okay )) 

396.14 398.71 A: so it's a 

399.50 406.06 A: new topic but today is friends and we're supposed [laughter] to stay focused on friends right [laughter] 

404.15 409.44 B: mhm well maybe you can meet a friend like that too while talking you never know 

408.37 412.04 A: right right right right right yeah so 

410.02 410.93 B: yeah 

411.42 418.42 B: well have you moved a um a lot around the country because if you move a lot it's also um very easy to lose friends

423.04 424.71 B: oh okay 

423.71 425.71 A: so yeah

427.28 435.80 A: so my i would love to be able to move [laughter] to find you know maybe some new friends [laughter] but you know 

430.76 432.05 B: [laughter] 

434.60 435.63 B: mhm 

435.95 441.35 A: that's that's that's definitely a go but as for you know i need stability

486.11 487.36 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

486.87 499.41 B: not um get burned and maybe it will be better for them if you do stay in the same town because if they start develop their shi- friendship and do find very good friends if they move then they lose it 

498.26 500.53 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

499.89 502.22 B: that's a bad part about it
