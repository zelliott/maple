0.00 1.58 B: hi my name is andrew 

1.02 2.45 A: i'm sheila [sigh] 

2.56 4.87 B: oh okay how how you doing sheila 

4.24 5.21 A: okay 

4.92 10.91 B: that's good [sigh] um well i guess i'll get started here if you don't mind um [lipsmack] 

10.80 20.56 B: (( i have to say i probably like eating in restaurants more um just for the simple fact that you don't have to really do anything that they the job is to spend the time to take care of you and they bring you your food and then you get to select from the menu and so all the items are already going to be made you don't have to be )) 

20.66 23.81 B: (( very involved in the preparation yeah i i never cook so [noise] cooking to )) 

23.84 34.10 B: (( me [noise] would be buying food [sigh] um in a a [noise] place where i can take the food out whether a fancy [noise] supermarket or h- you know fancy food place and bring it home and open the containers [noise] so i eat out all the time except for breakfast food )) 

29.40 30.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

33.44 38.21 A: (( [mn] )) 

38.34 48.74 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] [noise] [noise] )) 

48.89 52.08 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

51.90 64.36 B: okay b- but i would have to say though that it sometimes it is nice to cook for yourself because for one thing you get to control how the food is going to taste more so than if you go to a restaurant [sigh] 

53.91 56.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

57.25 58.13 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

62.11 62.96 A: uh-huh 

62.99 63.82 A: uh-huh 

64.27 76.66 B: and for another like a couple of weeks ago i cooked ah supper for my girlfriend and she really liked it and so it's nice when you're able to cook for somebody else and you're able to make something they they like 

66.91 67.74 A: uh-huh 

69.45 70.28 A: uh-huh 

70.73 71.54 A: uh-huh 

73.96 74.79 A: uh-huh 

75.64 79.25 A: well if you want to do that but [mn] at this point i don't want to cook 

78.81 81.16 B: okay [laughter] well yeah 

79.62 87.25 A: uh-uh i've cooked for years and years and years and you have to prepare it and you have to wash up and you have to buy the food and blah blah blah 

86.59 88.63 B: d- did you work in a restaurant 

88.20 90.81 A: no i didn't [sigh] never did 

88.94 90.06 B: (( oh okay )) 

90.23 91.51 B: (( oh okay oh )) 

90.82 96.48 A: or may- maybe once for one day [noise] [sigh] ah but um you know i really didn't work in restaurants 

92.70 93.85 B: okay 

96.31 97.68 B: right 

96.70 108.50 A: but um at this point i'm just a lazy person and i just like you know getting the food there and also one sees other people there so it's a it's not quite a connection but at least you're not isolated because at least you see 

99.94 100.50 B: (( [noise] )) 

108.34 113.33 A: get to talk to the waiter or the waitress and sometimes other people there [sigh] an- 

109.49 111.38 B: (( [noise] right )) 

112.45 114.84 B: now you mentioned oh sorry go ahead go 

114.08 115.33 A: go ahead [sigh] 

114.89 119.64 B: you mentioned that you like to go pick up items and then bring them back home to eat is that correct 

116.28 116.84 A: (( [noise] )) 

118.70 127.78 A: well when i shop you know if i get water or orange juice or something i mean i might get some other item i got some nuts yesterday [sigh] and i got um 

122.41 123.37 B: uh-huh 

127.84 136.13 A: some sort of um plastic field beets from france the other day and you know i get other foods or i might get cereal or something 

136.04 141.42 A: so when i get that then i get [sigh] um maybe a package of take home food some 

141.33 155.44 A: veggie healthful veggie things prepared you know from a good salad bar without too much grease [sigh] um or you now other foods that i'm just wanting to eat maybe some turkey slices or a prepared chicken or whatever it might be 

155.13 168.46 B: okay so it sounds like when you when you do go buy something to to take back home you try to look for healthy choices i mean you mentioned turkey and chicken which are generally healthy and then you also mentioned kinda like salad type items 

158.70 159.52 A: uh-huh 

163.39 164.50 A: yeah i d- 

165.43 166.40 A: yeah 

166.45 167.52 A: oh yeah 

167.81 175.97 A: yeah or i might get cooked salmon you know broiled salmon or something [sigh] um and i might get you know a banana or some veggies or whatever and i 

176.07 181.61 A: i keep thinking and i know i should be eating more veggies so i am trying to eat more salads [sigh] 

180.82 182.06 B: (( [sigh] mhm [mn] i see )) 

181.66 182.66 A: uh-huh 

182.24 191.95 B: so you're more the exception because i would think that a lot of people when they say they go yeah if they're going to go to a restaurant like a a a ruby tuesday's or like a 

187.36 188.43 A: (( [sigh] )) 

191.67 193.72 A: no i hate those kind of places 

192.15 192.88 B: (( a )) 

193.04 196.64 B: yeah where you just get burgers and things like that 

195.14 198.65 A: no no no i'm not i don't go to places like that 

198.15 199.31 B: okay 

198.67 213.37 A: there's a very good italian restaurant near me that isn't very expensive and i could go there for about as much money as going to ah olive tree and olive tree i figure is such a dump and this place has great bread [sigh] um they have olive oil with 

213.32 223.64 A: garlic and olives an' you dip your bread in that and you know the food is really good [sigh] yeah and um [noise] salmon with um horsera- filled with horseradish covering and 

216.88 217.79 B: (( mm mm )) 

217.80 219.28 B: does sound good 

223.64 231.74 A: um ah spinach with pinola nuts you know for about twelve ninety five so why should i go to olive tree for ten ninety five and eat that crap 

231.20 236.64 B: [mn] that's true so you like to go to it looks like more your local kinda restaurants 

234.67 235.94 A: (( [sigh] )) 

236.54 240.55 A: um yeah definitely to a ma and pa sort of restaurant 

238.14 239.16 B: okay 

239.94 248.22 B: okay [sigh] yeah those usually are pretty good they usually have a pretty good fare and then too they're also more willing i i i've noticed to 

244.41 245.17 A: uh-huh 

248.15 255.27 B: accommodate special requests you might have about how you like the food prepared or if you if you want something left off or whatever whereas kind of 

251.90 253.47 A: definitely [sigh] 

254.52 256.20 A: (( [noise] [noise] sure sure )) 

255.32 259.38 B: more at the restaurants or main chains they kinda just 

257.36 258.36 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

258.83 263.69 A: right i have and also i have a very small kitchen i have eight inches of counter space 

259.45 261.06 B: just 

263.44 264.64 B: oh 

264.00 267.51 A: so i have to clear this makeshift tabletop that i built 

267.40 279.46 A: you know behind that area um or in front of it if you want to describe it that way [noise] so you know there's d- when i used to give dinner parties years a go i used to have pots and pans on my bed which is adjacent to the kitchenette [sigh] 

271.68 272.69 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

278.85 280.07 B: (( oh [sigh] )) 

279.58 293.14 A: so you kn- and or i would put the dishes in the refrigerator if i was too tired to wash them at night [sigh] um s- it's 'cause it's not easy cooking you know it's one thing if you have a big kitchen with plenty of counter space it's more fun that way 

284.00 286.84 B: mhm mhm 

292.73 298.39 B: yeah [sigh] so is is part of it n- not only just um [lipsmack] ah 

297.19 297.97 A: (( [sigh] )) 

298.43 305.82 B: convenience for you but it also sounds like a space issues as well yeah right yeah 

299.68 300.74 A: yeah 

301.76 315.81 A: oh definitely both issues definitely once in a while i like to make a kinda complicated dish i mean one you know for going to somebody's house for a holiday or whatever that i don't mind if it takes several hours or whatever [mn] 

307.90 308.93 B: uh-huh 

312.02 312.95 B: uh-huh 

315.21 316.17 B: (( i see )) 

316.44 320.54 B: so well that ah i guess oh go ahead [mn] 

318.35 319.52 A: yeah re- 

320.16 334.82 A: recently i went downtown i wanted what's um called potato cogo it's a potato pudding with ground potatoes and it's made with onion and egg and seasoning [sigh] um and it's not something that i do every day so i went and got it from this place i knew had it downtown 

334.53 344.38 B: uh-huh sounds like you're in an area where there is a lot of local kind of restaurants and and places that you can sample like that oh okay 

339.96 340.69 A: (( mhm )) 

341.86 345.14 A: yeah i'm in new york in manhattan where are you 

345.22 346.94 B: knoxville tennessee 

345.43 347.61 A: [noise] oh really [noise] 

347.08 354.23 B: yeah so there's not too many ah kinda there's a lot of chain places around here and 

348.75 349.66 A: uh-huh 

351.94 360.71 A: [sigh] there are chain places too and we have plenty of um mcdonalds and wendy's and you know things like even wendy's is better than mcdonalds i think 

354.24 355.50 B: (( right [noise] )) 

357.09 359.02 B: right 

359.73 371.25 B: right but i think that ah i i would have to say that just my perception of new york having never been there lived there is that there probably quite a few local places that the the local places have a better chance to survive 

363.51 364.26 A: uh-huh 

365.07 365.85 A: uh-huh 

371.20 374.90 B: in that kind of area than than some other places 

371.62 372.70 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

374.08 376.72 A: wouldn't they [noise] s- be able to survive where you are 

376.36 383.66 B: [sigh] [mn] well ah you would think so but there's like there's not too many really what i would say just locally owned restaurants that are 

382.55 387.96 A: the the the reason that landlords rent to these chains is they get more money 

387.63 388.99 B: yeah 

388.34 390.10 A: they get the higher rent [noise] 

389.41 391.33 B: that's true that's a good point 

390.73 403.54 A: i know somebody who's in the real estate business you know and they rented a mcdonalds and and building actually it was owned by this quite famous artist at that point [sigh] and they get really high rent so i mean you know it's a shame that it 

398.79 399.58 B: (( mm )) 

403.47 408.47 A: sells out the public by having these awf- [mn] and i think it's kind of awful places 

408.05 413.34 B: right [sigh] it yeah it's i mean it's unfortunate that ah i guess the sad fact is that 

408.62 409.47 A: um 

413.17 427.98 B: in just the way m- mcdonalds and these other places are just so dominant that they can basically drive anybody out which is which is a shame 'cause i think you know a a l- a lot of these local places have something important to offer 

414.04 414.60 A: (( [sigh] )) 

416.47 417.32 A: uh-huh 

418.23 419.05 A: right 

421.01 422.51 A: right right right 

423.76 424.70 A: right 

427.51 431.86 A: i would think that you know lower rent streets would be able to have them or something 

431.13 433.14 B: yeah 

431.95 436.65 A: or the side streets do you have more ma and pa places on the side streets 

433.28 434.25 B: yeah 

436.81 446.13 B: um yeah k- you know yeah kinda off the ah off the main roads kind of that is where you're going to find some of those kinds of places right 

439.64 440.59 A: off the m- 

440.99 442.00 A: yeah 

443.20 448.79 A: the sort of secondary ones but i guess in knoxville do you drive to where you eat mostly 

448.22 450.31 B: oh yeah yeah ah 

448.97 449.83 A: (( oh )) 

450.03 451.36 A: here [sigh] you 

450.63 457.08 B: yeah public transportation here is not ah nearly as good i'm sure as in new york [sigh] um 

456.76 459.03 A: not only that [noise] most people walk 

458.99 461.40 B: yeah 

459.74 469.02 A: you know this is one of the last cities where they walk to a lot of the activities not always but you know people might eat near their home or near their work or whatever 

463.65 464.21 B: (( [mn] )) 

466.72 467.96 B: right 

468.30 474.72 B: n- now i know a lot of myself i bring my lunch to work but i know there's several there's several ah 

471.33 473.66 A: ah ha aren't you good 

474.50 486.82 B: ah ladies i work with here that they make a regular habit of going out to some of the local places and there are a few places downtown here that they eat at but there are also some ah other restaurants that they go to 

476.14 477.21 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

479.27 480.65 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

482.05 483.98 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] uh-huh )) 

486.23 487.61 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

486.74 491.01 B: um kind of you know five m- minutes away or so 

490.64 491.50 A: uh-huh 

491.01 493.42 B: that they drive to ah 

493.05 494.47 A: uh-huh [sigh] 

493.38 506.18 B: and so they they really like going out to those places and i think they go to several kind of local kind of places like there's a place called tomato head and i think they make special they make speciality kind of pizzas and that kind of thing so 

495.97 496.84 A: uh-huh 

500.49 501.37 A: uh-huh 

503.75 505.31 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

505.46 508.67 A: uh-huh but aren't you good that you bring your lunch 

508.59 513.11 B: well it's more a ah cost saving measure than anything else 

511.16 517.12 A: yeah it certainly is it's a cost saving and you can eat healthier [sigh] or eat eat exactly what you want 

513.55 516.27 B: yeah yeah and 

516.60 519.26 B: basically yeah yeah it's a 

518.24 519.13 A: uh-huh 

519.28 522.17 B: it it gets expensive eating out i mean 

521.22 532.12 A: oh yeah i mean y- i used to be able to find three dollar places at one time and some dollar fifty places and i'm not talking when it was just cheap food before seventy three 

526.05 527.03 B: yeah 

531.78 532.84 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

532.24 539.11 A: but um it's it's extraordinary to find a place for lunch that where you end up p- paying under five dollars 

538.52 543.95 B: yeah if you can pay under five dollars and you get a good meal that's yeah you're you're 

540.62 541.38 A: (( i )) 

543.01 556.85 A: mean if you get a meal if you get something i found a fantastic wrap with veggies where i got half a wrap in this very fancy place near when i went to an um a- an arthritis exercise place recently and that's kind of amazing 

544.51 546.65 B: [laughter] right 

550.52 551.64 B: yeah 

554.31 555.27 B: uh-huh 

556.99 566.24 B: yeah i i have a friend here at my work too he ah he always tries to [mn] he his wife works downtown here too so they go out to eat 

566.06 574.65 B: and he's got a few places that he goes to regularly because he can get a good deal like that he can get a good p- portion to eat 

567.26 567.82 A: (( [sigh] )) 

569.28 571.24 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

574.05 574.96 A: (( uh-huh )) 

574.49 582.39 B: and not have to pay you know an exorbitant amount for the both of them so yeah it's tough to find places [mn] 

576.04 577.20 A: (( a lot )) 

578.25 579.91 A: yeah yeah 

581.53 584.41 A: do you have local southern restaurants at all there 

584.66 586.02 B: there are a few 

585.67 586.54 A: uh-huh 

586.03 599.95 B: um [sigh] but yeah um [sigh] i'm trying to think there's it it is kinda disappointing that there aren't more kind of sit down nice restaurant kind of choices downtown in this downtown area 

594.27 595.08 A: uh-huh 

596.14 597.00 A: uh-huh
