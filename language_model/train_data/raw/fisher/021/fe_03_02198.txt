6.86 8.80 A: i'm okay um 

8.92 14.53 A: well uh i like i prefer eating in restaurants myself as opposed to having to cook at home [sigh] 

15.04 19.15 B: um i prefer to cook at home 'cause i i love cooking 

19.19 21.07 A: oh that's good [laughter] 

19.67 28.62 B: [noise] [laughter] though once in a while in a restaurant is not too bad as a special treat but i do prefer at home 'cause i always know what goes into the dish 

21.45 22.16 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

28.47 29.97 A: mhm that's true 

29.75 31.21 B: yeah are you in the 

31.86 33.32 A: i'm in new york city 

32.39 35.65 B: states oh you're in new york city oh i'm in montreal canada 

35.66 43.24 A: oh okay wow [laughter] well see here i guess if when you're in well in new york city it's always so much of a choice 

36.66 38.26 B: [laughter] so well 

43.35 46.31 A: and so many different different um kinds of 

45.25 48.72 B: (( that's what i was going to say the restaurants are really great in new york city )) 

48.36 52.87 A: yeah i mean there's yeah and they're always open very late too which is another thing and in new york 

52.99 63.20 A: one of the the things that you kinda lose when you get apartments is kitchen space so for me i don't really have a i i like to cook myself actually i love to but i don't really have the room to do it 

57.68 58.33 B: (( yes )) 

58.62 59.66 B: (( [noise] )) 

63.53 73.67 A: or the very best refrigerator at that so it's kinda hard so i really if when i look at it that way i do prefer to go out it's easier to have somebody clean up and 

73.50 80.34 A: it's just easier than having to make a mess in a tiny kitchen where there's really no place to move around you know 

80.03 87.92 B: i would probably feel the same way as you i'd like to go out more if my kitchen was small i would 'cause i like to cook but i lot i like a lot of space 

84.48 85.71 A: right 

87.85 88.81 A: mhm 

88.53 89.87 B: to cook and ah 

90.02 91.05 B: keep it [noise] 

90.19 95.27 A: yeah i think i you know sometimes i see beautiful kitchens inside these magazines you know with the 

95.03 96.22 B: (( yeah 'spec- )) 

95.41 106.55 A: the islands to cook cut up your food sub zero fridge the stainless steel you know like ovens and i think wow if i had that i'd love to stay home and cook too i mean it would be great 

101.78 102.44 B: yeah 

107.09 111.03 A: but uh you know unfortunately [laughter] i have a tiny little counter space 

111.14 114.85 A: ah the fridge is not tiny but it's not the biggest 

114.88 124.40 A: once you get inside it doesn't go in deep so you gotta be careful how much food you buy 'cause you don't want the stuff to go bad because you know the door was open or the freezer door was open so 

124.59 129.31 B: what are the like ah in new york city i guess you guys have really good ah markets 

124.73 125.79 A: that's why 

129.25 135.95 A: yeah we do actually we have um ah new ah gristiti's i don't know if you're aware of the gristiti's chains a 

135.35 136.08 B: no

140.39 146.02 A: all different types of food they have a big bakery fresh bread seafood 

146.30 151.79 A: um a whole big cold cut area i mean it's it's huge 

151.96 154.02 B: does it have pre prepared stuff 

151.97 153.63 A: and we actually 

153.87 154.54 A: (( hm )) 

154.35 158.78 B: do they have pre prepared stuff like if you if you didn't want to cook but you wanted to pick up a meal 

156.65 158.39 A: you yes 

158.66 168.04 A: you mean like the ones at yeah they have like let's say you wanted to get um they have a pre prepared cooked ah roast chickens but they have the meals that also come with like mashed potatoes and stuff 

168.17 170.46 A: and vegetable sides and all that 

170.52 173.33 A: and it's fresh it's not like a um 

173.77 174.79 B: then they're 

173.89 180.91 A: [lipsmack] it's not like a microwaveable where it's frozen it's pre pre made but it's still fresh and they keep it like in a cool area 

175.77 176.56 B: (( okay )) 

176.60 177.52 B: yeah 

180.88 195.79 A: [noise] and um it's really good though i mean we we i've gotten some of their um meals there like if i don't want to cook that night i just want something quick i was hungry i just wanted to go home and just eat i picked up that type of stuff and it's nice it's and it's good i've never had a complaint about it 

181.32 182.13 B: (( oh right )) 

196.45 197.43 B: (( oh that's good )) 

196.56 202.87 A: but i d- i do agree with you say about um it's always good too to know what you're actually cooking 'cause sometimes you're not sure of 

202.86 208.51 B: yeah in restaurant especially if you're watching like what you're eating like with a special diet like if you have 

203.11 204.82 A: some places cleanliness 

207.70 209.73 A: i'm a vegetarian myself 

209.17 210.61 B: oh you're a vegetarian 

210.23 211.16 A: yes 

210.83 216.67 B: oh so then the logistics of going out to eat is is probably that's it you'd want to know what's what it's prepared with no 

216.56 221.98 A: yeah well a lot of times i will frequent like a some thai restaurants i usually um 

221.68 223.87 B: oh thai i love thai food 

223.33 227.77 A: right 'cause there's a lot of those types of restaurants they they primarily have a 

224.08 224.81 B: yeah 

227.75 239.19 A: a menu with vegetarian meals where you can actually find out whatever's in it you can question everyone but i like restaurants like that that you can ask about what's this what's that or that indicated on the menu 

239.36 241.35 A: but this is vegetarian i mean 

242.25 249.49 A: even i mean i normally go to restaurants that even more you know they don't cook the food with the meat as some places will see

265.85 268.32 A: yes i did actually for the first couple of months 

268.34 271.40 A: but it became very hard because i wasn't producing enough milk 

271.44 273.39 A: but i did it as long as i could 

271.61 273.51 B: oh i had the same problem 

273.52 274.23 A: hm 

273.93 275.50 B: i had the same problem 

275.29 277.89 A: yeah really yeah i it was it 

276.34 278.20 B: i toughed it about five months 

278.84 283.63 A: yeah for me it was even it was shorter it was like a couple of months and i tried getting help but 

283.84 286.37 A: um you know it would i kept getting well 

286.58 292.40 A: you know maybe they're not latching on right and blah blah bl- you know the same old same old stories but i'd do it and 

291.68 292.53 B: (( yeah same here mm )) 

292.85 305.62 A: i'd know i was feeling the crunch in my on my uterus i was i was knowing that the baby was sucking but she would say hungry hungry hungry all the time so i started supplementing with formula and completely switched over 

305.89 310.10 A: and i had to i started taking dairy again when i was pregnant 'cause i knew it was very important 

310.18 316.76 A: for the developing baby so that's why i stopped being a vegan 'cause it was just too strict while i was pregnant i didn't think it was it was good 

317.24 319.81 A: [lipsmack] so that's why i became just vegetarian 

319.93 323.10 A: um how does you have a child then yeah 

322.17 323.75 B: yeah a year and a half 

323.38 326.56 A: wow [laughter] congratulations to you

328.11 329.60 A: thank you [laughter] 

329.50 334.80 B: so that means yours is like november ah december january february march april so five months 

334.55 338.58 A: yeah she's about five and a half months now 'cause she'll be six months on the eleventh 

335.20 336.00 B: (( oh okay )) 

338.54 340.19 B: so she's on solids 

338.77 339.86 A: of may 

340.11 340.77 A: (( hm )) 

340.55 342.21 B: she's starting to eat solids 

341.57 347.61 A: i just started introducing cereals to her and i'm going to introduce like solid foods around when she turns six months 

344.24 345.21 B: (( oh okay )) 

348.03 351.69 A: like ah eating broccoli and start some vegetables and fruits 

351.74 353.12 A: [lipsmack] but um 

353.24 362.89 A: you know it's it's going good with her and i guess the same i mean who knows what she might like when she get's a little older probably see i was thinking about as far as food's concerned for her making them fresh 

363.10 365.76 A: um getting the broccoli myself 

365.89 367.90 A: and chopping it up and feeding it to her 

367.95 375.44 A: um and see how that works too because i i have a little mixer here in the house where i can chop it up and mix it and make it you know mushy so they can eat it 

375.36 377.32 B: oh the best thing's a hand held you 

377.39 381.42 B: (( know the hand held mixers like a um i think um moulinex has one )) 

377.75 378.70 A: hand held 

381.23 382.07 A: uh-huh 

381.66 385.90 B: that's the best 'cause i made all my ah my own ah i used um 

386.08 388.29 B: [lipsmack] what do you call it in english it's organic 

388.30 389.23 A: yes 

388.43 392.86 B: yeah and i fed him only organic vegetables so i prepared everything myself 

390.95 391.94 A: oh that's good 

393.09 394.67 B: um it's the best 

394.68 396.65 A: that's great yeah 

395.40 399.41 B: yeah if you're if you're looking and you use a hand held ah mixer 

399.47 400.39 A: mhm 

400.00 401.78 B: a hop skip and a jump and it's done 

402.14 406.55 A: yeah and and i know that too it's another thing it's also economic too 

406.32 411.11 B: oh yeah exactly but you also the same thing you know what they're getting because if you the ingredients 

407.40 408.49 A: you buy 

409.69 410.54 A: exa- 

411.06 411.94 A: right 

411.57 413.16 B: (( on the )) 

412.47 414.82 A: and there's all kind of preservatives and stuff in there 

414.79 418.26 B: yeah and you just freeze it you put it in wi- ice cube trays [mn] 

417.70 418.59 A: mhm 

418.39 420.28 B: you know yeah it's it 

419.65 420.89 A: well that's a good idea 

420.90 424.73 B: oh no great you just stick in a couple they usually eat one or two 

425.10 426.46 A: that's a really good idea 

425.85 429.77 B: veggies yeah and then you can start mixing like peas and carrots and stuff like that 

429.46 430.32 A: right 

430.09 433.46 B: but ah no it's it's the best you'll see try it 

433.97 437.60 A: yeah that no definitely i will that's great thanks for [laughter] the information i was 

437.02 439.10 B: (( i know p- [laughter] no problem )) 

439.07 449.82 A: i always take um any kind of information i want and any advice that you give me 'cause i'm new to this you know and i'm baby but i mean i love it but it it can it's overwhelming

461.85 464.23 B: well we're having one around here 

464.28 475.24 B: like a a french one 'cause it's also 'cause the problem with the ones in the states like i ha- i ah i go on the parents pages and stuff like that but ah to get information 

466.48 467.47 A: mhm 

472.42 473.22 A: mhm 

475.45 486.23 B: ah it doesn't apply to us canadians there's a lot of stuff like coupons and stuff like that it's all sold in the u._s. and there's a lot of cool stuff that you guys have i can't get here 

477.49 478.65 A: oh that's true 

480.86 481.78 A: right 

486.02 491.52 A: right because it like contests and stuff because i- if you win a prize they don't send send it overseas or whatever 

491.48 494.00 B: no that's it and ah yeah 

493.29 499.08 A: or they don't send it um if they consider another crun- country they don't want to pay the shipping and handling prices and 

497.86 506.61 B: the international fees and stuff like that but it's even just accessing getting stuff like ah at the stores like you know you see something oh that's interesting 

500.00 500.99 A: right

516.87 518.94 A: right red tape basically 

518.47 520.80 B: (( it yeah it's a little bit more complicated )) 

520.66 524.04 A: well hm have you taken um your son to a restaurant yet 

524.57 526.19 B: (( ah yep )) 

525.70 531.17 A: yeah i took my daughter and [laughter] i had gotten a little bit of um [lipsmack] what do you call it the ah 

532.08 535.65 A: [sigh] the the fruit it's not ice cream it's a sorbet 

535.38 536.68 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

536.36 540.97 A: [lipsmack] and um i was giving her little bits on her mouth and she was just loved it 

541.32 550.29 A: and she was freaking out it was like one of the first restaurants i took her to and it's just a problem sometimes when you go to some of the restaurants that don't have like they're not baby friendly they don't have um [lipsmack] 

550.03 551.74 B: (( no the ones i've taken him to )) 

550.76 552.61 A: diaper changing and 

552.23 555.45 B: yeah the ones i've taken him to are are ah kid friendly 

555.31 556.12 A: right 

555.71 561.16 B: like we have a a few restaurants who have like a a separate little room where there is a a video that plays 

560.91 562.62 A: mhm oh that's great 

561.26 568.55 B: and they have all types of toys and stuff so when you're eating dinner like you're near the room and it's all glass so you can see him so 

567.87 569.61 A: oh that's great 

568.80 573.05 B: oh it's yeah it's really great if you can find like a couple of restaurants like that 

572.86 575.23 A: uh-huh that's really cool what's the name of that one 

575.19 578.10 B: (( ah it's here in quebec it's ah saint hubert )) 

578.16 580.77 B: it's like a chick- it's ah yeah it's like a chicken place 

578.18 579.23 A: saint hubert 

581.28 592.99 A: well i always find that there's a lot of good things in other places besides new york uh you know a lot of times it's they only have such great restaurants which they do but they don't have always have those options though those added options like if you have children 

593.02 594.62 A: or anything like that 

593.30 598.00 B: yeah new york's probably not big on kid friendly restaurants because it's more of an adult ah ah to 

597.42 598.68 A: (( right and )) 

598.08 599.74 B: (( the city )) 

599.49 599.89 A: (( then ))
