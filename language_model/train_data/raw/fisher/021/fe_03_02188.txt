206.76 207.47 B: i 

208.58 215.85 B: that's right but if go and you sa- and you dwell on the bad things in your life my gosh the whole world's gonna be unhappy

216.98 218.06 B: and 

219.58 220.53 A: that 

220.95 227.50 A: that as you get older in life the more you don't take so you know you don't take things to heart so much 

226.95 235.47 B: yeah exactly you're right you're right [laughter] i think you're a- i've never talked about that but [mn] i mean i've gone there and th- that's the way i feel 

235.77 242.85 A: yeah and when you're young you take everything like oh this is it and that's why i think 

241.56 245.05 B: it's like a disaster yeah yeah 

243.76 252.13 A: that's why i think all those things like ah the things you hear on the news with the kids in the high school going nuts and everything 

250.04 252.76 B: (( mhm ahah [cough] )) 

252.40 256.88 A: because they're taking everything like this is it and you know 

257.32 267.40 A: you have to just wait i remember years ago when i was young you know you go through those stages oh life isn't worth living and all this and that 

266.04 267.16 B: yeah 

267.23 268.08 B: right 

267.36 278.09 A: and my friend told me he says oh don't feel that way he says don't you want to be around to see curtain going up 

277.68 278.94 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

278.04 285.09 A: so he says look at life like a stage show you know you wanna see what's the next act is 

284.78 286.23 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

285.13 288.65 A: and i never forgot that because if you look at 

287.13 289.34 B: that's a very good example 

289.01 295.31 A: yeah if you look at life like it's just a show you wanna see what's gonna happen [laughter] 

294.36 298.27 B: (( [laughter] yeah let's see what's behind the next curtain [laughter] )) 

297.26 304.22 A: right and oh i know what i was gonna ask you how's the job situation in texas 

303.85 307.95 B: well [sigh] pretty tight but i i think it has gotten better 

307.96 308.93 A: (( yeah b- )) 

308.15 316.66 B: um there's still a lot so many people unemployed i mean i was unemployed for a while and jobs were just not out there you couldn't get a job 

316.55 325.88 B: i mean it is really sad because like all these older people like my mother for example twenty eight years in one company and she was fifty eight years old well they they're forcing them to retire 

326.01 327.66 B: and you know 

327.72 333.53 B: th- so they hire somebody who had a lower income and all and it's not it's just awful it's sad 

333.04 335.20 A: that's what they're doing now 

334.67 346.16 B: it is so sad 'cause at at that age my mother wasn't old enough to draw all her social security and she wasn't old enough i mean she she couldn't live off of what you know the little bit that was coming in 

343.08 343.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

346.04 347.44 A: right yeah 

346.85 350.63 B: and then you gotta try and find a job at that age and nobody wants you 

349.72 351.91 A: (( [mn] exactly [sigh] )) 

351.21 365.23 B: and that's tell me that ain't discrimination and my mama took i think two and a half years to find a job bless her heart and it was awful you know she'd go from like maybe ten bucks at sh- an hour to hardly any at six or seven and you yeah something like that 

365.25 373.83 B: but you it it is times are very tough if you if you got a job you better hang onto it around here 'cause they're few and far between 

373.23 386.68 A: and that's what i tell everybody it's not if if you work and you hate your job and you don't like this one or don't like that one just be quiet and just say it's just a pay check and just 

375.36 378.10 B: yeah i mean i don't care if you don't 

379.71 380.93 B: (( uh-huh )) 

385.25 400.18 B: [sigh] and be thankful you have a pay check coming in you're right oh absolutely you know 'cause [sigh] if you like i say if you got a job you better keep it you like it or not un- unless you got to find one first you know and that's they're hard to find i'm i 

388.35 390.09 A: exactly 

400.21 410.67 B: talking from experience i i just you know i moved to another city um in december and of course i didn't look for a job immediately so around january i started actually looking 

410.92 421.78 B: and i finally it took me about a month before i found a job you know i'd have all these interviews or go put in applications among two hundred and three hundred others you know they may call you back 

422.21 424.14 B: but it's pretty tough 

423.76 427.78 A: yeah where in the past gee five years ago 

427.95 431.83 A: (( there were so many jobs and there weren't [laughter] enough people to fill them )) 

430.26 439.58 B: yeah you didn't have to worry about any you know if you walked out mad and decided to quit you could [laughter] but now golly don't walk out [laughter] you better keep what you got 

432.24 433.23 A: [laughter] 

439.76 448.19 A: yeah because that's exactly what happened to me i got laid off and sometime i get just in the dumps you know that there is no work 

443.28 444.83 B: (( [noise] [noise] [sigh] )) 

446.39 447.44 B: (( [cough] )) 

447.47 450.49 B: i know it you got that right [noise] 

448.71 457.55 A: so i've gotten to the same point too just like your mom i figure i'm going to go below my education 

453.02 454.92 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

456.92 465.82 B: (( it's sad that you have to though [noise] you know but if you want an income you have to it it it's just that it's like starting all over again )) 

461.57 462.98 A: right 

465.86 473.56 A: and just ah take a job and just start because you know i say the thing is gonna open up again 

466.30 467.15 B: (( [noise] i )) 

473.29 478.78 B: i think so [noise] i really do so i think everything's the same way their end 

475.35 476.57 A: yeah
