197.92 206.09 B: um kind of not really i i try not to 'cause i mean like the more you know about it the less you want to eat there one of those things you know 

200.50 201.39 A: (( yeah )) 

204.33 207.52 A: right yeah it it's it's it's really bad yeah 

206.76 211.27 B: yeah especially like taco bell like once you find out about taco bell you just you never want to eat there again 

211.30 212.14 B: [laughter] 

211.30 217.85 A: right yeah i just i just refuse to eat at any of the ah any of the fast food places just it's unbelievable how bad they are 

217.24 222.39 B: yeah that's good like i i i try not to and every now and then i i will but 

221.79 227.24 A: yeah i mean if there's if i'm starving and there's no food except for a mcdonalds hamburger then i guess i'll eat it but 

226.70 236.91 B: yeah likewise but yeah um i i've just heard horror stories about you know fast food restaurants how everything's like instant and ugh just 

227.52 228.34 A: (( [laughter] )) 

232.60 233.54 A: yeah it it's 

233.85 234.95 A: crazy 

236.31 246.49 A: it's amazing how many mcdonalds there are up and everything like that mcdonalds actually it's really interesting i don't know if you knew this they're actually the largest um not the largest one of the largest landowners in the world 

246.29 247.46 B: oh really 

247.28 249.25 A: as far as real estate goes yeah 

248.66 251.01 B: wow that that 

249.78 256.52 A: because what what they do is they buy the property then they rent it out to um you know the whoever runs the franchise of mcdonalds 

252.16 253.05 B: mhm 

256.21 262.34 B: mhm i i heard somewhere that mcdonalds owns like one percent of all the beef in the united states 

262.32 263.34 A: [laughter] 

262.58 268.34 B: and like i mean one percent isn't really that much but when you think about it i mean gee that's a lot for one company 

268.21 271.07 A: yeah it is it's it's a lot of cow 

268.85 270.57 B: yes it's just yeah 

270.72 274.16 B: yeah [laughter] mhm but like 

271.50 272.56 A: (( [laughter] )) 

274.14 287.22 B: all all of my ah relatives like under the age of thirty are thirties cousins and ah an older brother are are vegetarians and they're always trying to convince me to go vegetarian and i guess there's a lot of you know 

287.23 289.82 B: good reasons for it but i'm just you know 

289.95 291.81 B: ah a natural meat eater so 

292.10 294.38 A: yeah um a lot of people 

292.11 294.31 B: i can't i can't really switch 

294.54 305.77 A: i know a couple of people that that were vegetarians or are or or are you know are kind of vegetarians and i know like some people that are um you know the vegan style vegetarian where you don't eat you know 

299.92 300.76 B: right 

305.18 308.33 B: yeah that'd be so hard to be vegan 

305.94 307.56 A: (( you need to control )) 

308.54 317.57 A: yeah and and i think i actually i mean every- ah my- the research that i've done shows that you're actually healthier if you eat you know some meat because 

309.04 309.83 B: yeah 

317.05 318.51 B: right 

318.12 328.31 A: you you need like you need some vitamins like iron i think is one of the things that that you get a lot from from eating meat and you know i mean like you can probably get it some some other way but oh yeah yeah 

322.82 323.99 B: (( mm )) 

324.73 325.62 B: mhm 

327.60 339.10 B: yeah you see a a friend of mine is like um he's a vegetarian but the rea- the reason being not really for animal rights reasons well it is now but he ah 

329.36 331.49 A: (( um )) 

339.94 346.16 B: like he never tried meat like he just refused to eat meat from like an early age for some reason or another 

346.00 360.34 B: it's just so weird i just can't picture ever like not trying meat i mean i'm sure he's tried it like accidentally sometime but like he he's like his body's so like set on not eating meat that now if he probably even had just a little bit it would probably make him sick 

360.06 361.87 A: but your body would just reject it 

361.42 369.84 B: yeah exactly but i don't know that's so weird and like he's he's sick a lot so maybe like not eating meat does something to your immune system or something 

369.18 371.76 A: yeah yeah it probably does yep 'cause he 

370.78 374.07 B: protein deficiencies and he's really weak so 

371.86 374.57 A: (( get it yeah yeah you don't get a lot of that stuff when you )) 

374.59 376.00 B: what's that 

375.39 381.11 A: you know you don't get a lot of things that you i mean we're meant to eat meat you know maybe maybe not as much as we eat now 

378.42 379.24 B: yeah 

380.72 382.09 B: yeah [laughter] 

381.70 383.27 A: (( [laughter] i- )) 

382.46 384.79 B: especially americans we eat so much meat 

384.66 386.49 A: it's really crazy 

385.77 392.38 B: yeah i mean compared to other cultures i mean they eat you know just just basic foods you know beans rice 

392.24 393.14 A: right 

392.41 396.82 B: things like that that i mean that's just their staple like meat is just like a staple in out diet 

397.00 406.99 A: it's like the the american diet is so crazy like i was um i was in my room the other day and i had like this cup in my room ah i just had like water i drink a lot of water so i had some water in it 

406.34 407.32 B: yeah me too 

407.25 418.74 A: and ah so but i was looking at the cup and it was like a cup that um i'd gotten at like a i think it was like a mc- you know a mcdonalds or maybe it was a baseball game or something but the cup was so big 

416.46 417.22 B: mhm 

418.81 419.69 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

418.82 427.98 A: that it was ridic- and it was a soda cup so like the the you know you would never go to another country and find like you know a um it had to be like a t- you know twenty four ounce 

427.65 428.64 B: oh yeah 

428.30 432.14 A: cup like that's ridiculous you don't need to drink that much soda 

429.89 430.84 B: (( yeah )) 

431.79 438.56 B: yeah the super sized nation i i yeah at seven at seven eleven and stuff excuse me 

433.79 435.22 A: oh yeah [laughter] we're getting 

435.28 437.19 A: (( super sized hips and everything )) 

437.97 440.14 A: we're getting super sized hips and 

439.51 445.55 B: oh i know it's just [laughter] [laughter] exactly i mean just the the obesity rate too is just you know 

440.46 441.18 A: (( [laughter] )) 

445.86 453.11 B: i've heard that like i i don't quote me on this but it's like one in four people are like severely over- sev- severely overweight 

453.21 455.30 B: or something like that that's just oh jeeze 

455.32 467.44 A: yeah yeah that i mean there's really it's only and the and there there's only like one percent oh not one percent excuse me one fourth i heard the same thing i think one fourth of people who actually are at a healthy weight 

463.02 463.87 B: yeah 

467.03 468.47 B: mhm 

467.93 480.37 A: and then some people are you know like a- another fourth is really you know unhealthy and obese and then the other people are just you know not at the right weight like they could you know lose weight or mm yeah like i i'd probably actually be considered overweight 

476.48 477.40 B: yeah 

479.81 480.77 B: mhm 

480.20 484.95 A: um only not because i'm out of shape i'm actually i work out every day for for like and hour or more 

484.14 486.20 B: (( mhm 'cause ah )) 

485.03 487.69 A: and ah i just weight more than i should like i 

486.66 488.67 B: yeah muscle weighs more than fat though 

488.38 497.00 A: yeah so i but for my height and everything i'm probably like about twenty or twenty five pounds over weight which i don't know if that's you know terribly unhealthy or not but the 

493.28 494.13 B: right 

496.32 497.51 B: yeah 

497.43 498.59 A: most part just 

498.79 500.45 A: aren't at the right you know 

500.39 514.58 B: yeah i don't know about where you live but cleveland's you know a big fat city i mean there's just fat people everywhere a f- a friend of mine's ah ah grandma who lives in the netherlands comes over and visit and that's something she always comments on wow there's a lot of fat people here

514.32 515.86 A: [laughter] 

514.95 521.14 B: i mean 'cause 'cause if you go to europe and stuff i mean there's just not nearly as many fat people as there are in the states you know but 

519.01 520.08 A: right 

520.71 526.46 A: yeah i it just the way we look at um eating is just a lot different than the rest of the world

526.35 528.10 B: i i mean i mean 

529.03 535.75 B: yeah i mean i i think in europe and stuff they view eating as kind of like a a a an art but i mean they don't overdo it
