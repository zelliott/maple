20.29 26.22 A: no we're not no no [laughter] to go right along with the topic huh 

25.28 27.26 B: right [laughter] 

26.80 31.15 A: so so d- did they ask us what to describe our perfect meal 

30.60 31.70 B: yes 

32.54 34.71 B: what's your perfect meal [sigh] 

33.80 35.46 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

37.63 43.03 A: well sometimes it's at home and sometimes it's to go out that depends on 

42.08 43.24 B: do you cook 

43.22 44.20 A: pardon 

43.84 45.15 B: do you cook 

44.57 46.07 A: not very often 

45.91 51.82 B: me neither [laughter] my perfect meal is somebody else fixing it whether it's at home or in a restaurant [laughter] 

46.60 48.01 A: [laughter] 

51.37 55.66 A: yeah well my husband does most of the cooking so and we're retired 

55.90 57.13 A: so 

57.66 69.41 A: but there are times that i could say i have a perfect meal at home and there's a time when i go out and have a perfect meal [sigh] and i guess to describe it it would be um 

69.49 74.24 A: a quiet restaurant not a lot of noise um 

74.34 76.02 A: glass of wine 

76.86 83.46 A: and probably prime rib would be my first choice 

83.96 85.99 A: and um 

87.65 91.28 A: maybe go to a movie after but generally not 

92.03 93.94 A: and just the two of us 

94.05 96.25 A: i think would be the perfect setting 

96.06 101.14 B: [lipsmack] wow that is right up there for me too the glass of wine the quiet 

101.23 113.13 B: i like going to places where there's not you know a lot of noisy children [laughter] and prime rib maybe would be my second choice i like the fillet mignon [sigh] 

113.27 116.40 A: [noise] i like that too i like that too 

114.77 115.75 B: uh-huh 

116.42 118.91 A: and i think a perfect meal at home 

117.63 118.19 B: (( [sigh] )) 

119.73 121.39 A: probably 

123.34 125.03 A: would be 

126.29 130.97 A: when we're entertaining but just another couple not big entertaining 

130.57 131.90 B: mhm 

131.32 132.47 A: um 

133.05 135.21 A: on a small scale 

135.94 138.13 A: somewhat informal 

139.16 140.42 A: um 

141.68 145.54 A: and it could be a wider variety of food really 

145.56 148.47 B: now you didn't mention any dessert would you have dessert 

147.89 155.83 A: oh yeah i would oh yeah if i had room yes i would yes i would i'd probably have a cheesecake 

151.19 152.96 B: [laughter] 

155.43 157.51 B: (( [mn] [lipsmack] ooh [mn] )) 

158.04 165.33 B: i usually have well anything that has chocolate in it is fair game um but i'm partial to ice cream 

165.45 167.15 B: ice cream sundaes 

167.73 173.63 B: probably my favorite type of restaurant is ah [lipsmack] one of those japanese steak houses 

173.16 174.24 A: uh-huh 

174.27 182.41 B: the meats there are just incredible they're always really tender and really flavorful i really like those 

181.68 189.04 A: you know i haven't been to a japanese steak house in a lot of years but i enjoyed it but i don't even really remember what i ate 

188.85 190.32 B: mhm 

190.62 197.19 B: and they have they have that uh plum wine that's real sweet and kinda kinda got a little tang to it 

197.74 199.46 B: that's really good 

198.72 202.47 A: i've i've had that because i have a japanese brother in law 

202.01 203.13 B: (( oh you do )) 

202.58 204.65 A: yes i do yes 

204.97 208.76 A: so i've definitely had that but i don't like most 

208.83 211.91 A: japanese traditional japanese food 

211.82 217.36 B: yeah i i don't care much for the sushi or the saki type of drink 

216.69 219.53 A: (( yeah and they ma- also make um )) 

219.79 222.05 A: [lipsmack] a fermented 

223.04 224.11 A: [sigh] 

224.67 232.89 A: oh it starts with cabbage and i don't know what all goes in it but it's also hot but it's fermented 

232.27 234.28 B: (( oh ah [sigh] )) 

234.21 235.33 A: i can't remember 

234.48 236.17 B: it starts with a k. 

236.56 240.51 A: if you said it i might i might recall but i i 

236.61 237.57 B: (( k- )) 

241.16 243.36 B: [lipsmack] i know what you're talking about 

241.95 247.30 A: i've tried that several times i've had it out and i've also had it home made so 

248.47 250.05 A: and neither way 

250.31 251.53 A: neither way 

251.95 254.16 A: so what else did they ask us 

253.95 255.61 B: [sigh] well let's see 

255.62 264.38 B: a- actually i only heard two questions do you like eating out better or in at home better and describe you're ideal meal your perfect meal 

264.89 266.70 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

265.94 270.45 A: i don't ha- i don't i like both there are times i like home 

271.85 277.07 A: i i don't have a preference it depends on the day and my mood 

276.87 278.14 B: mhm 

278.60 282.23 A: if i don't feel like getting gossied up then i prefer to be at home 

281.88 286.40 B: oh exactly yep if dressing up is part of it that's a whole different story 

283.42 284.32 A: and there is 

284.78 294.13 A: yeah sure it is and if although living in florida you can go rather casual to a lot of places but um 

294.79 299.17 A: i again i think it depends upon my mood and what kind of a day you've had 

298.58 305.16 B: mhm and the budget [lipsmack] [sigh] [laughter] 'cause you could always eat cheaper at home than you can eat out 

300.55 302.78 A: true yeah yeah 

304.47 306.85 A: that's true that's true 

306.50 314.32 B: although i've had some awful cheap meals at mcdonalds that weren't half bad [laughter] i'm sure they were terribly unhealthy but 

314.36 317.75 B: they they were tasty and they were cheap and they were fast 

317.07 321.44 A: well i well i i enjoy that once in a while but 

321.72 331.03 A: um i travelled too much with my daughter on the road she was a competitive swimmer so i saw too many years of of fast food 

331.26 332.40 A: so 

332.77 335.15 A: that's not my preference 

334.66 336.08 B: yeah 

336.57 337.24 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

336.67 339.25 A: d- do you do you like meals at home 

339.56 343.60 B: i do but i [lipsmack] i don't cook either and so 

339.72 341.54 A: do you like to entertain 

343.71 344.72 B: um 

344.46 349.97 A: well i used to cook it's just since we're retired my husband loves to cook so 

349.63 351.09 B: oh well there you go 

350.61 352.95 A: he he does 

353.51 356.69 A: [lipsmack] almost a hundred percent of it 

357.36 359.04 B: [lipsmack] yeah i am 

359.70 362.49 A: do you like to entertain at home in a meal [noise] 

362.08 365.56 B: it you know usually if i'm gonna um 

366.06 375.06 B: en- enjoy someone's company then i do prefer to go out to a restaurant because then we can sit and chat while somebody else is doing all the work 

374.45 375.36 A: right 

375.23 387.05 B: and that to me is is more fun than one either me or the other person having to um you know be up and about and worrying about the stove and the oven and 

386.35 397.22 A: well it you the one frequently when we have a meal at home and we're entertaining and again i'm talking small a small number we try to 

397.31 398.39 A: um 

398.60 401.31 A: plan our menu where we're not 

402.60 406.42 A: we're not really doing anything once our company has arrived 

406.44 409.09 A: it is kinda done food 

408.50 410.09 B: oh yeah there you go 

409.76 412.13 A: um so we're not 

413.79 416.02 A: we're not in the kitchen cooking 

415.80 416.93 B: (( mhm )) 

417.41 418.46 A: so 

419.12 423.55 A: other than that i'm i'm kind of at a loss for words on this subject 

423.81 429.33 B: [lipsmack] well how about um how important is it to be healthy do you think about that or 

429.08 431.04 A: (( not often enough )) 

429.35 431.88 B: is it more [laughter] 

431.19 433.59 A: not as much as i should oh 

434.06 436.46 B: i've been trying a little bit more lately 

436.51 447.44 B: um [lipsmack] i've been watching my cholesterol readings that's the big thing that i've been looking at and i've just made a few small changes like going to skim milk instead of whole milk and 

447.43 461.43 B: maybe not eating quite as much red meat if i have a choice between chicken and steak maybe every once in a while i'll choose the chicken instead and it's it's helped it's gone down the cholesterol so [lipsmack] yeah it didn't take that much of a change 

457.39 459.83 A: that's good that's good 

460.88 463.15 A: now do you do that when you dine out 

463.84 466.80 B: [lipsmack] well it's tougher when you dine out because 

466.14 468.24 A: see i don't do that at all 

466.98 468.66 B: (( [lipsmack] no )) 

468.25 471.32 A: that that's an extra special treat to me 

470.89 471.82 B: right 

471.60 480.76 A: so it it's any type of calorie watching or or anything is gone it's gone 

481.04 488.01 A: totally where i would not have desserts that often at home but i i would if i had room for it when i was out 

487.38 497.93 B: [lipsmack] right well i can't even keep desserts around the house literally i can't keep them around 'cause i eat 'em right away if there's chocolate or ice creams so i i just never buy them unless i'm 

498.29 501.48 B: going out and making a special night of it you know 

501.09 502.11 A: uh-huh 

501.60 505.55 B: [lipsmack] then it then it feels like a treat and it's not so often 

506.50 511.87 B: but if you're gonna have ice cream you know why have the the low fat stuff [laughter] [lipsmack] 

511.34 513.41 A: you do you like um 

514.09 515.76 A: [lipsmack] chain restaurants 

515.14 515.70 B: (( a )) 

516.55 518.98 B: (( few of 'em yeah um )) 

519.74 520.91 B: let's see 

521.29 524.11 B: t._g._i. fridays do you have those down there 

523.46 525.79 A: yep mhm 

524.92 528.76 B: those have there's so much on the menu there's always something good 

529.36 534.42 B: um and actually for the japanese steak house you know benihana's is just fine 

535.14 539.74 B: i know they have other ones but benihana's is oh okay 

537.41 539.39 A: i've never heard of that 

539.79 546.73 B: [lipsmack] they had those in i used to live in minnesota and they had those there and they have 'em in indiana and they have 'em here [noise] 

546.25 550.69 A: and i wasn't aware of those in michigan and i've only been gone from michigan for 

550.85 552.85 A: not quite two years so 

552.18 553.30 B: oh okay 

553.88 554.69 A: (( [lipsmack] no )) 

553.90 555.53 B: i used to live in wisconsin 

555.64 558.32 B: so i'm a bit cheese eater too [laughter] 

558.56 561.11 A: well that's not too good for the cholesterol 

560.15 562.04 B: no it's terrible 

561.46 563.28 A: yeah yeah 

562.65 569.02 B: and you know since i cut i cut back on cheese a little bit and i used to get migraine headaches and now 

569.10 573.17 B: i i hardly ever get them and i think some of it was the cheese 

573.98 576.44 A: was it dairy period 

574.11 575.57 B: so [sigh] 

575.82 587.80 B: [lipsmack] well it might be i hope not because i'm still drinking milk and and like ice cream and things like that but i used to have cheese at least once a day every meal had some kind of cheese 

581.99 583.30 A: yeah 

587.21 588.94 A: oh we have cheese all the time 

588.46 590.14 B: uh-huh [sigh] 

589.70 592.68 A: i mean if we're hungry we grab a hunk of cheese 

592.05 599.90 B: mhm well it's so good and wine and cheese and some good bread and well that's a meal all in all in itself
