381.21 382.71 A: when people work together 

383.35 388.34 B: yeah not necessarily at a job but you know at some kind of an activity yeah you know [noise]

406.87 408.03 A: (( [mn] [sigh] but )) 

408.05 419.69 A: i guess i'm just not one of these people who wants to have friendships i think take a lot of work if you do them right [laughter] yeah and people have you know fifty friends and it's like how do you 

420.08 421.31 A: maintain them 

421.13 429.61 B: [sigh] yeah i think there's always also kind of a different you know there's a different social skill set among people who make friends easily [sigh] um 

429.42 437.59 B: you know where um you know your [mn] i'm fairly horrible at the small talk i'm glad they give us a topic to talk about otherwise i wouldn't know what to do about here 

437.15 438.66 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

437.83 439.23 B: but um 

439.26 451.75 B: ah you know there are other people who just you know [noise] a- are wonderful at that sort of thing and um you know so they tend to put people at ease faster and [sigh] maybe the friends are superficial but ah 

451.82 456.16 B: you know that that that depends on what happens later but [sigh] 

455.39 459.36 A: yeah my husband is the centre of the circle when he walks in it's [mn] 

460.03 466.96 A: you know [noise] it all revolves around him and it's just kinda neat to watch [laughter] but [laughter] not for me [laughter] [noise] 

466.75 474.86 B: mhm [lipsmack] and ah you know it's it's you know you can ap- appreciate somebody else's skills in that area even if you 

474.90 476.70 B: even if you lack 'em 

475.32 476.09 A: yeah 

476.60 484.87 A: i'm not so sure that it's all skill i don't think it's necessarily learned i think some people it's in the they're just born that way 

484.79 494.93 B: yeah oh that's probably true and you know there are certain things that certainly help with it [noise] ah you know certain physical attributes and [sigh] 

487.81 488.57 A: yeah 

496.28 501.76 A: like people who talk with their hands [laughter] i think that's attractive to people they feel like they're 

501.90 503.66 A: open and welcoming [sigh] 

503.70 505.08 B: (( um yeah )) 

505.02 506.37 A: body language 

505.44 507.38 B: either that or deaf one of the two 

508.46 517.76 A: [laughter] oh yeah i don't know any deaf people actually so [laughter] i don't have any deaf friends do you have any deaf friends 

517.47 520.64 B: well actually ah four of my sisters are deaf so 

521.01 522.25 A: wow

522.98 525.31 A: you have four sisters and they're all deaf 

525.04 527.82 B: yeah so there's just the five of us 

528.61 533.70 A: oh my goodness now how did that happen it it's obviously a genetic thing right 

533.12 542.20 B: yeah it's some sort of recessive gene so the fact that they're all girls and the fact they're four out of five of them is just you know that sort of random luck [sigh] but ah 

541.50 542.25 A: oh 

542.85 548.49 B: um so you know [mn] when i think of talking with the hands that's the first thing that comes to mind 

547.99 549.75 A: oh is your mother deaf [mn] 

549.40 550.73 B: no uh-uh 

551.14 552.42 B: [sigh] and ah 

552.60 554.86 B: [sigh] the funny thing is that ah 

554.87 556.03 B: um 

556.16 562.77 B: you know the there's there's three that are profoundly deaf and one who can use the phone but still leg- is legally deaf 

562.71 572.83 B: [sigh] so she has the most hearing but she married a deaf guy who has i- it's much more strong genetically in his family so she's the one the only one who has ah 

573.15 581.67 B: two of her kids are deaf and one is not um so you know that's kind of the interesting thing there ah 

576.58 577.42 A: oh 

581.26 581.83 A: (( [noise] )) 

583.40 587.53 B: sorry you're fading in and out actually you're out now
