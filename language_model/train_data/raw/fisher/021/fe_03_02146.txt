158.58 162.86 B: mm [sigh] well i i like eating at home because of [mn] y- you know 

163.31 171.81 B: [noise] you know we we call it an outing we go ahead and bring the food into the the rec room or the living room or whatever and spread out and you know

172.42 173.51 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

174.08 185.02 B: and that [mn] you know i kind of enjoy that even more because you know you don't have to wait [sigh] then you know you [noise] could sit out the couch or you know what lay on the floor do whatever you want 

185.06 186.08 A: okay 

185.61 189.44 B: [sigh] and you know you don't have to worry about the kids running around [noise] and

199.72 201.47 B: [laughter] 

200.81 209.45 A: you know it's just that my husband likes to watch all that sport [noise] so he has a little [mn] coffee little thing in front of his t._v. only on sundays do we really

209.59 211.90 A: i make sure that they really eat 

211.98 225.90 A: you know at at the table but unfortunately that's the problem at a restaurant you couldn't do that really you have to all sit at the table and you have to [noise] and even though you try to watch you know a sports program it's kinda hard so that's another advantage of eating at home 

213.41 214.24 B: mm 

223.47 224.31 B: (( mm )) 

225.56 226.42 B: (( yeah [noise] ))
