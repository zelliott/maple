0.06 1.83 A: hi this is lynn 

1.87 3.79 B: hi this is stephanie 

3.67 5.76 A: hey it's nice to talk to you 

5.45 6.89 B: (( nice to talk to you )) 

6.74 10.32 A: [laughter] [sigh] um what do you want to begin 

10.51 11.45 B: um 

11.52 18.03 B: sure so we're supposed to say whether we'd prefer eating at home or eating out and basically what our best 

18.31 19.44 B: reason is 

19.22 20.21 A: yeah 

19.87 31.61 B: okay i prefer eating out [laughter] just because i cook all the time [laughter] um i prefer dining at i have a few restaurants that i like the most um based on their 

31.77 37.61 B: food quality and service and it's kind of a nice break just to get out of the house 

37.14 39.01 A: (( yeah i could imagine )) 

39.08 43.25 B: i have two small children and a husband who love home cooked meals 

43.11 44.55 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

43.69 51.20 B: [laughter] so it's always a nice break to just get out and go get a bite to eat and relax and be waited on 

52.32 62.18 A: yeah i kind of agree with that um i don't cook very much at home 'cause i'm still a student but when i do get a chance i like to i guess um currently my 

62.20 72.37 A: best meal would be a home cooked meal only because i know that i can't get indian food in in a restaurant like i can just when i cook myself at home 

71.93 72.96 B: right 

72.78 81.14 A: yeah so i like to just like last week i think that would be my best meal in a year 'cause i cooked a um three course meal for my friends 

81.10 92.50 A: as a graduation present and i- yeah and i had them over for the entire evening and all we did was eat and eat and eat and i think that was definitely my best meal [sigh] [mn] 

83.01 84.87 B: oh that's nice 

89.29 90.59 B: [laughter] 

92.38 106.10 B: [sigh] yeah you know it's sometimes nicer when you can cook for everybody too especially when it's the kind of food that you're used to or a certain type of culture [sigh] i agree you can't find that at a restaurant 

105.92 107.90 A: yeah yeah 

106.14 107.12 B: at all 

107.64 109.78 B: yeah i have i mean i'm 

109.85 115.80 B: half i'm part chinese and like when my mom makes chinese food it does not taste like a restaurant 

115.71 116.76 A: oh that 

115.85 120.01 B: it tastes completely like home made authentic 

119.70 121.05 A: yeah 

121.35 132.59 A: i think in restaurants they just sometimes i mean unless you go to a really good authentic small restaurant they tend to put a lot of oil in the food and it's just so greasy that that kind of covers up the rest of the 

122.25 122.89 B: (( [cough] )) 

132.70 133.67 A: (( flavor )) 

132.84 139.49 B: right right yeah it's hard to find a a restaurant that has like home made good food 

139.62 143.77 B: instead of just like the regular everyday commercial kind of food 

143.37 144.56 A: yeah 

145.37 146.88 B: i would say yes [laughter] 

145.56 146.36 A: (( where )) 

146.96 150.50 A: wh- where is your mother from is sh- are you first generation 

150.15 157.07 B: um my it's actually my dad is hawaiian chinese and japanese but my mom cooks 

154.67 155.63 A: (( [sigh] )) 

157.78 160.24 B: she learned to cook from his mom 

160.11 161.76 A: (( oh wow )) 

161.17 164.39 B: so she cooks all that kind of food 

164.37 165.80 A: and do you cook 

164.44 165.96 B: which is really nice 

166.42 174.44 B: i cook some chinese food it doesn't ever taste as good but i cook more like american food and italian and things like that 

169.85 170.70 A: okay 

174.06 175.18 A: right 

176.04 178.88 B: easy stuff 'cause i have two toddlers so 

178.35 179.84 A: (( oh )) 

179.51 181.08 B: they have to you know 

181.12 182.70 B: they have to like it too 

182.43 185.16 A: yeah what what do they like to eat 

185.01 187.01 B: [sigh] um [sigh] 

187.26 197.61 B: they're basic they like chicken they like steak they love vegetables and fruit and things like that so anything time i incorporate like vegetables and stuff they love it 

197.92 198.92 A: okay 

198.55 201.56 B: so they'll eat just about anything as far as that goes 

201.41 203.24 A: oh where do you stay 

203.44 205.62 B: i am in southern california 

205.57 208.96 A: oh wow i have a cousin who's going to u._s._c. currently 

208.71 209.85 B: oh okay 

209.53 210.63 A: yeah 

210.05 212.30 B: that's about an hour from me 

212.09 213.84 A: okay she loves it 

214.80 220.65 B: the good thing a- like in that area there's a lot of more bicultural restaurants and things like that over there 

220.59 221.78 A: oh 

221.09 224.83 B: which is kind of nice l._a. has a lot of that to offer 

225.05 227.17 A: okay um do they have 

227.20 231.43 A: like a d- do they have any indian food restaurants or chinese food restaurants down there 

230.49 232.66 B: (( oh ya ya ya )) 

232.50 233.63 A: (( that's great )) 

232.80 237.15 B: in the city that i live in there's a couple of indian um 

237.23 243.00 B: restaurants in fact i've never been to them but i have friends who've gone and said they're really good 

242.50 243.41 A: okay 

243.16 246.80 B: but i think it's hard to compare when you're used to like the home made 

246.73 247.97 A: yeah 

247.55 249.61 B: it's much harder to compare it 

249.90 263.17 A: yeah and i think that's how if i do go to a restaurant i like to eat the um food that i'm not so familiar with for example like malaysian food i like going to a restaurant for it because even though i've been to malaysia once i 

263.17 270.75 A: i you know it's still close enough to be authentic and i don't know enough about it to be able to point out faults in [laughter] 

267.96 268.98 B: right 

270.09 271.09 B: right 

270.80 272.55 A: it and then makes it easier 

272.70 276.77 B: yeah i love trying different new foods i've had i've had 

277.04 281.17 B: i had indian food a long time ago when i was a child 

281.28 288.02 B: and parts of it i liked and parts i didn't [noise] i just remember there was a ton of food and it came in a lot of courses 

287.62 288.59 A: (( [laughter] )) 

288.04 290.29 B: [laughter] 

288.66 290.93 A: [laughter] yeah 

291.00 293.29 B: i do remember that from when i was a kid 

292.91 294.24 A: [laughter] 

294.26 298.47 B: but uh yeah i had a friend who had taken me there in fact 

298.38 299.55 A: oh 

300.28 302.78 B: but uh yeah i've had lots of different 

302.80 307.01 B: uh types of food where i live you get your basic italian 

307.05 312.55 B: um american food things like that but it's nothing real extreme 

312.50 313.48 A: (( okay right )) 

313.87 318.82 B: but there is like i think there is two indian restaurants out by me 

317.70 318.60 A: right 

318.87 319.59 A: (( yeah )) 

319.56 320.92 B: but i haven't been there 

320.98 324.78 A: oh you should try them the i like indian food a love it 

324.24 328.53 B: i should try them the problem is is my husband is very picky [laughter] 

327.89 329.47 A: oh [laughter] 

328.81 334.84 B: he's not as open to eating new things i grew up eating sushi and he wouldn't even try sushi 

334.61 336.04 A: oh really 

335.58 339.59 B: so yeah it just makes it you know it's a little different when uh 

339.86 342.08 B: you grew up on certain things 

341.74 343.03 A: yeah 

342.37 345.13 B: and your spouse doesn't [laughter] 

344.73 352.79 A: yeah that's true i i've never i've never eaten sushi well i tried it once after coming here but i didn't like it and i think it's a developed taste 

352.39 356.35 B: oh yeah and plus there's so many different kinds of sushi to eat as well 

355.16 357.11 A: yeah yeah 

358.22 364.84 B: yeah i mean i've i've had different kinds growing up it's been in my family since i was a kid 

362.00 362.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

363.51 366.59 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

365.13 367.61 B: but my husband hates sushi so 

367.36 370.73 A: [noise] oh so i guess you don't get to eat it all that much any more 

370.32 373.05 B: only if i go with my girlfriends [laughter] 

372.39 373.85 A: okay [laughter] 

373.36 374.72 B: they'll eat it 

374.55 375.94 A: yeah 

375.14 378.12 B: they all like it but he's not too partial to it 

378.50 379.65 A: like i 

379.42 390.02 A: live next to philadelphia and so when we dine out it's usually in philadelphia and there's there's there's a lot of these asian fusion restaurants which i think [noise] end up being better than 

387.36 388.79 B: mhm 

389.83 395.04 A: um a lot of authentic or what claim to be authentic [sigh] food restaurants just 'cause it's 

395.06 402.55 A: like it's so different for example the last time i went i had something called pea soaked um beef ribs 

402.50 403.86 B: mhm 

403.04 407.29 A: and they have got to be the best ribs that i've ever eaten [laughter] in my life 

405.85 407.06 B: [laughter] 

407.37 408.95 A: they were so good 

408.69 411.28 B: i've never had something like that huh 

410.60 421.93 A: yeah me neither i had never heard of them but it's just i guess it's like the pea soaked pod comes from somewhere in the east and then the spare ribs i figure is southern food so a nice blend of both 

421.77 423.62 B: oh yeah that is nice 

423.25 424.50 A: yeah 

423.80 427.00 B: it sounds good i've never had anything like that 

424.95 426.06 A: (( yeah and )) 

426.77 427.60 A: [laughter] 

428.50 433.62 B: hm sounds like something i'd like to try i'll have to see if there's any place out here that has that 

431.14 432.18 A: yeah 

434.57 437.05 B: that would be nice so you're in philadelphia 

436.90 441.28 A: yeah i study at bryn mawr but um we go to philadelphia a lot 

441.02 446.26 B: oh okay i have uh my husband has family that live in 

447.20 448.63 B: (( [sigh] oh )) 

448.69 450.25 B: i'm trying to think 

450.82 452.75 B: [lipsmack] it's near hershey 

452.88 454.13 A: okay yeah 

453.83 457.62 B: they live over there somewhere his grandmother lives there 

455.09 456.01 A: oh 

457.48 458.40 A: okay 

458.50 460.34 B: but uh yeah 

460.64 463.02 B: there's a lot of small towns out that way 

462.75 464.76 A: yeah there are a lot 

464.08 468.32 B: i think they live in like dillsburg or harrisburg or something like that 

468.31 469.23 A: okay 

468.94 470.38 B: it's somewhere near there 

470.67 477.73 A: so do your husband's mm parents uh did you say one's a hawaiian he's one's a hawaiian one's a 

476.83 481.81 B: no that that's my dad uh my husband is 

479.00 480.28 A: oh your dad 

481.97 488.52 B: swedish french and something else i don't remember he's very very white 

488.48 490.97 A: oh [laughter] 

488.58 494.95 B: [laughter] as opposed to me i have like hawaiian skin and dark hair 

494.69 496.27 A: (( oh oh )) 

495.65 499.06 B: so he is really fair fair skinned 

500.73 508.57 B: so he's he's used to just plain old things and i'm used to a lot more different kind of cooking and stuff like that 

500.79 501.64 A: and 

507.75 508.74 A: okay 

509.89 511.28 A: oh that's neat 

511.04 519.30 B: but yeah i try to cook a variety of things 'cause he'll eat anything he just [sigh] he doesn't care as long as it's dinner [laughter] he'll eat it 

518.17 520.04 A: [laughter] 

519.32 523.04 B: [laughter] so he's really easy when it comes [noise] to that kind of stuff so 

522.40 523.97 A: oh that's great 

523.67 529.81 B: but i love cooking but i just do it all the time i get bored so i'll be w- i'll want to go out or something 

529.26 538.53 A: yeah oh once in a while i just like um i have an aunt nearby who's house i visit and sometimes she just gets so sick of cooking at home that she just 

538.60 541.27 A: they just have like a pizza night once a week 

540.99 542.27 B: oh yeah 

541.94 547.42 A: and that's just fun 'cause um they all just sit in front of the television don't talk to [laughter] each other [laughter] and eat pizza 

547.81 560.38 B: yeah it's it's nice to get [laughter] out every once in a while my husband and i do a lot of date nights and we get a babysitter and we go to you know we try to go somewhere different for dinner and maybe go to a movie or go get a coffee or something 

552.88 553.95 A: oh 

560.20 561.80 A: ah that's so nice 

561.39 566.80 B: so we try to do a lot of that just because he knows i get burnt out from cooking and 

566.15 567.44 A: yeah 

567.18 572.03 B: [noise] different stuff like that it's not always that fun [laughter] 

569.74 570.52 A: oh 

571.60 573.65 A: [laughter] i can imagine 

573.68 577.10 A: i couldn't imagine cooking on a daily basis i think that would get 

577.30 579.63 A: it would take the novelty out of it i think 

579.30 582.86 B: it's it does [laughter] especially when i 

580.69 581.96 A: yeah [laughter] 

583.04 587.38 B: i'm cooking usually three meals a day breakfast lunch and dinner for my kids 

587.19 588.01 A: okay 

587.68 589.65 B: so it's it's a lot 

589.70 590.69 A: oh 

590.51 598.41 B: but they they don't care they would eat jelly sandwiches every day they would be happy with that so with them i i'm very flexible 

593.70 594.85 A: [laughter] 

595.39 596.02 A: (( yeah )) 

598.14 599.12 A: okay 

599.43 599.95 A: (( i w- ))
