23.13 24.11 B: okay 

24.42 27.78 B: well uh let me see um 

28.18 35.45 B: i am really more the kind of person i have a lot of acquaintances a lot of people who i like 

35.47 46.19 B: hanging out with but um i probably only have like uh maybe a handful of really close friends like friends that i 

36.35 37.48 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

46.75 49.96 B: totally trust just without even thinking [noise] 

49.88 61.35 A: mhm mhm um i i don't have a lot of friends friends i it's it's it's kind of similar to you and yet it's a little different i have a couple of uh 

61.82 73.14 A: close friends that i've known for many years but i tend to be more of a loner type so i don't need a lot of people um i have some acquaintances but 

73.37 74.95 A: you know if if if 

75.01 82.19 A: if they're around good if if they're not that's okay too i i can do things by myself i don't really need to have a lot of people around me 

82.08 83.33 B: right 

82.51 90.53 A: but i would say that my best friend i guess possibly because i trust her is my daughter uh 

89.83 91.87 B: (( oh that's so sweet )) 

92.07 100.54 A: [laughter] thank you it's just that i i trust her uh you know she's blood and all this other stuff if it's a a friend um 

100.97 102.61 A: i don't know it just 

102.70 106.87 A: i'm i'm i guess i'm not a very trusting person so uh 

106.04 107.26 B: right 

107.16 115.63 A: anyway my daughter's my to me uh she's my best friend if you ask her she's got other best friends but that's okay um 

111.04 112.07 B: oh 

115.71 122.56 A: but you know it's just for me [mn] it's not that important to have many many friends 

122.27 127.70 B: right i agree and and and the acquaintances that i have it's just um 

125.80 126.81 A: (( mm oh )) 

127.91 134.45 B: i'm around a lot of sport a lot and like you said although i'm around a lot of people 

134.33 137.58 B: i'm an only child and i i 

137.44 149.46 B: i i would almost much rather sometimes much rather be by myself um because it's just that's the way i like it and sometimes when i'm around my friends too much even my closest friends 

141.35 142.38 A: (( uh-huh mhm mhm )) 

149.28 154.23 B: i have to have what i call becca time and just be by myself 

154.02 168.49 A: uh-huh uh-huh i i understand what you mean i i myself am also an only child so i didn't like it growing up but you develop a a sort of independence that uh because of that situation so that you can 

168.63 176.69 A: be by yourself you don't really need to be with a lot of people but i find it interesting that we're both you know only children and 

175.70 177.07 B: that is funny 

176.81 180.05 A: yeah and we kind of feel the same way 

180.02 183.42 B: yeah i i agree um 

180.55 182.02 A: mhm 

184.25 191.48 B: i um let me see what else about friends uh i recently have um 

192.05 198.66 B: i graduated from college last may so i've been out of college for almost a year now 

194.74 195.77 A: uh-huh 

198.34 199.56 A: mhm 

198.74 207.52 B: and um it's been kind of and i've moved and it's been kind of i've kept my my close knit group of friends from college but it's been really hard for me 

207.71 208.85 B: you know 

207.91 209.55 A: (( mm yeah )) 

209.01 216.63 B: new friends i mean i have a new job but it's it's different with that work atmosphere is so much more different than that school atmosphere 

216.09 217.68 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

217.02 218.03 B: um 

218.62 221.00 B: so that 

219.50 231.54 A: yeah no no i understand what you mean in in a school atmosphere you're sort of like all in the same boat you're sharing things uh it's it's the first time that maybe you're away from home and you're becoming independent 

226.18 227.19 B: right 

231.34 237.56 A: whereas if you're working and especially if you've moved somewhere it's completely different there's a big expectation 

231.53 232.57 B: right 

237.47 243.51 A: and you have to make money whereas in school maybe they have parties and things that you do in groups 

239.88 241.91 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

241.92 243.16 B: (( [laughter] )) 

243.35 255.66 A: at work depending i mean there are some uh places where you work where they do have uh like softball or soccer or things that they do every once in a while but yeah the focus is a little different i think so 

243.53 244.90 B: (( yeah )) 

255.18 256.19 B: right 

256.15 261.39 A: it is hard it is hard and also i find that sometimes people are very cliquey 

261.41 262.42 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

261.98 271.26 A: so it's very hard then to to get into that clique if you're at work and you've just you're new there and other people have been there a long time it's very hard to get in there 

270.98 280.63 B: uh-huh another thing that i found to be a little bit challenging is that like while i am making those like kind of new acquaintances that might one day end up developing into 

280.58 288.44 B: a a meaningful friendship um my room mate who i've had for five years isn't really in an environment at all where she would meet 

287.71 289.51 A: (( mhm oh )) 

288.35 299.22 B: new people and so it's been a little challenging because i'm out meeting new people and making new kind of connections and she's not and sometimes i feel so um 

299.24 303.72 B: kind of sad about that and almost guilty for for meeting new people [noise] 

303.11 304.60 A: mhm mhm mhm 

304.62 315.91 A: um i guess if she really wanted to she could make the effort to meet someone also i don't think you should feel guilty for something you know that she may not she may not want to do it 

315.58 317.40 B: [noise] right [noise] 

316.22 320.93 A: you know because even though she's not in that environment if she really wanted to she could make an effort 

320.88 322.00 B: mhm 

321.23 326.38 A: so i was just talking about the guilt part that you know um 

326.47 327.56 A: that that's 

327.85 334.25 A: i know we're supposed to talk about friends but it's you know don't don't put that burden on yourself i guess that's what i'm trying to say 

334.22 335.19 B: (( [noise] right )) 

334.98 336.74 A: you know but anyway we're supposed to we're 

336.79 339.80 A: supposed to talk about friends yeah and um 

339.86 343.14 A: i guess you're influenced by her obviously you know if if 

342.50 349.41 B: [noise] well i am i mean she's she's my she's i was with her for five years and while i consider her um 

346.91 347.98 A: (( oh well )) 

349.53 357.46 B: my i consider her one of one closest friends just because she really does know me so well because we have lived together for such a long time 

354.39 355.42 A: mhm 

356.98 358.04 A: mhm 

357.62 360.52 B: um but um 

360.66 365.10 B: you know th- you can't always be best friends with the people that you live with you know 

364.23 366.23 A: right right [laughter] 

365.15 376.96 B: you can [laughter] you know you can't can't always do that i i just think that's great that you said that your daughter was your best friend um i i i i i think of my mother as one of my close friend you know 

367.71 368.95 A: mhm 

376.06 390.11 A: oh really oh oh that's really nice that's important because i think then when when you have children you'll you'll have that with you and you probably will end up being a best friend or a close friend with your children you know when you get to that point 

377.12 379.32 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

390.11 391.11 B: right 

390.49 396.74 A: you know uh it's i guess what you bring to it but thank you for that um i was just 

395.10 397.13 B: (( no i think that's great )) 

396.89 402.17 A: i was just curious where where do you where did you finish or where did you go to college

432.83 439.06 B: yes well and it's a little bit more spread out than it is in new york i haven't been to new york in about 

439.17 447.40 B: i'd say five years five or six years [noise] so yeah i had a great ti- i had a great time when i when i went there

445.75 446.88 A: yeah it's it's 

447.05 455.11 A: it it's changed now because of you know nine eleven the atmosphere is a little different than it was before too do you know what i'm saying so mhm

464.87 475.48 A: yeah yeah but uh we're we're doin' okay [laughter] we're doin' okay but um i ge- we're supposed you know i find it very hard to like just focus on one topic for ten minutes 

468.20 469.61 B: (( good )) 

474.33 479.17 B: i know it's hard i can't talk about like like just friends forever 

478.58 490.00 A: [laughter] right [laughter] exactly it's like ten minutes is too long to talk about one topic [laughter] yeah so i'm like i'm trying to wrack my brains to come up with 

484.54 485.82 B: it's true 

486.50 487.99 B: definitely true 

489.79 497.31 B: i know well this one time i had this friend i [laughter] i can't think of i can't think of of of every kind of example you know

534.92 543.73 A: um but again i don't really feel i need that much which is good because sometimes you can't count on your friends 

544.22 545.05 A: so

546.88 555.89 A: actually she had moved out she had moved out to long island and then because it became very expensive new york is very expensive she came back
