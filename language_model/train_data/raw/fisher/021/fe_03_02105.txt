5.16 6.22 A: how are you 

5.82 7.47 B: i'm fine thank you 

7.49 19.24 B: i i guess we're supposed to talk about best friends or i don't have a whole lot of friends i don't know about you i have more male friends than uh female friends uh but i do have uh quite a few uh 

19.32 25.48 B: long distance female friends that are best friends in different states um nothing local 

25.77 31.64 B: uh so i don't know i guess i [laughter] you'd have to say what uh what friends you have [laughter] 

30.99 36.09 A: i have lots of friends only a few that are very close 

35.64 37.24 B: (( mhm )) 

36.32 48.41 A: and most of those i've known for a long time and live halfway across the country um i do have a few close friends locally uh after you some people you just 

41.65 42.98 B: mhm 

48.44 51.11 A: meet and get along with right away and 

50.66 51.99 B: mhm 

51.33 58.55 A: i've got a couple of those friends here but for the most part [sigh] my really good friends i have a small group of really good friends 

58.60 61.70 A: and then a pretty big group of [sigh] 

62.29 64.66 A: somewhat friends and acquaintances 

64.12 74.32 B: mhm yeah well i have i call those associates i have a whole lot more ass- associates than what i would consider uh close friends i'm very reclusive uh most of the time 

68.89 69.68 A: (( [laughter] right [laughter] )) 

74.20 87.80 B: and because of hurt in my past i don't tend to trust right away it takes me a minute to uh people are in trust with me it's not like i wear my trust on the sleeve once i see you i automatically trust you that's not how it works for me 

78.75 79.60 A: right 

87.66 90.52 B: uh but once i see that i can trust you 

90.42 99.02 B: then you're like a friend to the end for me that's what i consider a friend for i do have you know uh where i used to live up and down the east coast so 

98.80 106.96 B: i have a fr- best friend in each state pretty much [laughter] and whenever i can get there uh i do you know we keep in touch and if we don't 

101.93 102.70 A: (( [laughter] yes )) 

106.78 121.27 B: hear from one another nobody holds it against the other we we appreciate it whenever we do you know and that's what i consider a friend you know that could understand that you have your life too [sigh] and that they don't you know get upset because they didn't hear from you today 

121.28 133.15 B: uh so you know that's pretty much how uh i do it but i love having them whenever i do have a friend [noise] uh you know the male friends are a lot better because they uh they're not as petty for me 

132.77 133.75 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

133.20 135.98 B: women tend to watch what you wear 

136.00 139.90 B: you know criticize it if you're attractive oh she thinks she's all that 

139.80 150.32 B: you know but you should think you're all that if you don't no one else will but guys tend to not be concerned with that it's like you're just their friend [laughter] let's go have a good time 

143.06 143.88 A: (( yes )) 

150.13 164.35 B: and that's that [laughter] so that's basically where i am with the friend thing uh but i i tend to get like a lot of people wanting to be more around me than i am you know they're calling all the time and i'm like a diehard friend 

164.60 175.51 B: but i'm not as receptive [laughter] you know of the other side of it yeah so you know they they think that they're closer to me than what they really are [laughter] in my book 

166.61 167.39 A: (( yeah )) 

173.84 174.74 A: well 

174.84 177.58 A: the ones i consider my closest friends are 

177.66 179.27 A: almost like family 

178.93 180.06 B: mhm 

179.63 185.84 A: and then i have a bunch of friends that i like to hang out with and we do stuff fairly frequently 

186.08 189.11 A: and spend time together and talk lots and 

188.85 190.34 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

189.72 192.74 A: have fun and then of course there are the 

192.92 200.36 A: associates and stuff that you see occasionally and they call and they think there's more there than there really is and 

199.66 201.99 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [laughter] )) 

200.64 202.72 A: all that kind of good stuff so 

202.09 211.75 B: yep [laughter] that's because you're not a mean person and that's the way that i am i'm not mean so i don't want you to think that i don't like you that's not how i come off 

211.53 219.19 B: but what i consider close to me um i just don't verbalize it i'm friendly with everyone um but you know 

216.92 217.66 A: yes 

219.08 224.54 B: those who are really my best friends they know that they are my best friends because i say it 

224.19 226.41 A: actions and words yes mhm 

224.34 238.75 B: and exactly so you know but everyone else it's you know they think that we're like that and ah de dum because ah you know that's fine but i do keep a certain amount of distance um within my personal affairs my personal life 

238.56 253.06 B: uh with my my family my children you know what comes across my threshold what walks into my home is definitely has to be a friend yeah so you know um other than that i hold the rest of everything else that i'm 

252.91 259.78 B: going through within me [laughter] until i can get to the real friend [laughter] it's [laughter] well that- 

257.30 258.37 A: yes 

258.78 262.25 A: you don't want to spread too much to people who could betray you [laughter] 

261.84 272.94 B: oh of course i've seen enough of that to last me the rest of my life and i mean they use it as weapons so i uh tend to uh stay away from that it keeps me alive a little longer 

272.67 273.48 A: (( yes )) 

273.96 274.74 A: i 

274.09 274.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

274.91 278.46 A: think in the past i've tended more to over trusting than 

278.28 279.41 B: mhm 

279.18 282.57 A: not but uh i haven't been burned too badly 

282.14 284.56 B: yeah i understand 

282.87 283.52 A: i 

284.11 286.40 A: i do have a few friends that 

286.58 287.56 A: well 

289.85 292.73 A: a few people i'm friendly with that uh 

293.11 296.13 A: really annoy me but i just 

294.34 295.72 B: yeah [laughter] 

296.28 299.10 A: don't have the heart to say go away 

298.67 300.59 B: yeah yeah [noise] 

299.72 301.69 A: [laughter] fortunately 

302.04 308.12 A: the key ones have moved across the country so i don't hear from them very often 

307.78 311.96 B: mhm which is great [laughter] 

308.53 309.50 A: and it's 

309.63 310.87 A: a relief 

311.30 321.42 A: [laughter] it sounds horrible to say it but it's a relief but i've never been able to you know they're nice enough people it's not their fault they were born with a obnoxious personality disorder 

315.77 316.79 B: mhm 

320.87 322.66 B: yeah [laughter] 

322.02 329.00 A: uh type of thing uh it's nothing in particular it's just everything all together they're annoying [laughter] 

323.21 324.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

329.14 343.56 B: i know i know they can't help it and that's another reason why you find it hard to uh you know to to not say it i mean to say it to them because you don't want to hurt someone who's just just naturally being themselves i mean they don't know any better 

341.56 346.08 A: right i mean if they were doing it on purpose i would have no problem saying you know what 

345.08 346.52 B: exactly 

346.12 353.10 A: you're a pain get away from me but when you can tell it's not something they're doin' on purpose and that they're really trying 

348.51 349.36 B: [laughter] 

352.74 354.65 B: yeah yeah 

354.04 358.48 A: i just don't have the heart to say you know what you bug me go away [laughter] [mn] 

357.06 370.08 B: [laughter] me either i'm i'm actually the same as you i guess that's why i have so many of those type on my plate they they kinda gravitate toward me my personality i'm friendly i'm giving i'm loving 

370.01 380.83 B: and they they're fooled by that to think that you know they can always be my buddy but at the same time they're so far off where i am i'm a business person and uh 

381.00 387.17 B: i'm into other things and inherent you have those who don't want anything in life and they are 

387.04 391.83 B: you know draining and you know weighing heavy on me and they don't realize that 

391.71 394.65 B: when they can call you at three or four in the morning 

394.43 399.39 B: you know sometimes you're stressed and you wish you can have someone to talk to at three or four in the morning 

399.17 411.49 B: but they're the same ones that say oh well don't you realize how late it is or you know the very ones that quickly forget that they just called you last week you know at four in the morning and you had to be up at six for work 

404.35 405.24 A: yeah 

407.74 408.83 A: mhm 

411.49 426.35 B: you know what i mean so i i'm i'm one of those people if you cannot you know if there cannot be a balance i don't want it i don't want it at all you know because i'm not going to keep giving giving giving and there's nothing coming back you know you gotta come 

412.32 413.15 A: (( yeah yes )) 

424.76 431.66 A: [mn] yeah you see i have my key player list and if it comes up on caller i._d. at three in the morning and it's not on my key player list 

430.86 432.93 B: [laughter] 

432.05 435.64 A: uh i'm not answering my my machine'll get it 

433.04 434.21 B: [laughter] 

435.11 449.18 B: exactly well see i have to get like you i'm not that way yet i've a tendency to feel guilty for not answering it thinking that someone would really need me and if it was me i would wish that someone would did it have done for 

448.16 450.12 A: well if it's an emergency 

449.76 450.94 B: (( mhm )) 

450.28 456.60 A: i mean it's enough that i'll groggily listen to whatever the message is while they're recording it 

456.04 457.04 B: mhm 

456.83 459.21 A: so if it's an emergency i can pick up 

457.82 462.31 B: yeah i see what you're saying [noise] 

460.62 464.94 A: but if it's not an emergency why are they calling me at three in the morning 

464.60 466.31 B: yeah [noise] i hear you 

466.25 468.97 A: a real friend in a non emergency 

469.46 470.48 A: um 

469.64 472.33 B: yeah would not do that 

471.55 476.26 A: you know unless they're the key players on my list they know they're allowed to 

475.97 477.05 B: mhm 

476.43 478.93 A: everybody else is supposed to understand you know 

478.32 479.72 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

478.97 484.48 A: ten o'clock at night on if you there's work the next day [laughter] that'd be the cut off at 

482.71 483.68 B: mhm 

484.25 485.44 B: [laughter] 

484.52 485.78 A: at the minimum 

486.06 492.19 B: i hear you well i'm going to have to do like you because friends is what got me out of the hospital this morning 

492.12 504.83 B: uh from you know stressing attack and being everybody's shoulder so i'm really going to have to uh prioritize uh the same way that you are perhaps i'll live a little longer you think 

504.49 505.62 A: [mn] yeah 

505.00 506.55 B: [laughter] 

505.66 510.21 A: that that would be a nice thing and your really close friends will really appreciate that 

506.94 508.44 B: (( [laughter] )) 

509.58 524.47 B: exactly you're right about that and i'm gonna take your advice i there's nothing wrong with having friends but i think that it should be you know a not a one sided thing it should be everybody's that really appreciating uh the friendship not just one 

522.16 523.34 A: definitely 

524.38 533.91 B: person so that's where uh i think i'm going i'm going to copycat you [laughter] i'm going to have a key player list [laughter]
