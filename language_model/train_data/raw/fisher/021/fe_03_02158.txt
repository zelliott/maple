231.70 233.07 A: mhm 

232.40 237.87 B: you know so i like doing that and that's the way i like to cook at home is do things like that 

237.24 238.60 A: yeah 

237.91 241.04 B: something that's 'cause sushi is very expensive

241.30 242.38 B: when you eat it 

242.73 249.81 B: when you eat it out you know well this is very exciting to be able to talk to somebody from clear across the country

248.84 251.12 A: (( i know i know )) 

249.86 255.25 B: and we- and we're to talk on the topic of probably [laughter] one of our favorite things 

253.91 257.63 A: [laughter] things which is food i know [laughter] 

256.04 259.83 B: you know 'cause they really didn't give us any guidelines

260.53 262.58 B: just said talk 

261.92 263.54 A: talk mhm 

262.54 277.52 B: okay so let's let's talk about food i watch oh god i watch all the cooking shows and listen to them on the radio oh yeah because i like i learned how to do the art of muki mono which is a japanese vegetable carving 

264.85 265.79 A: yep 

267.89 268.98 A: oh do you 

270.02 270.95 A: mhm 

273.98 274.84 A: mhm 

277.06 278.36 A: mhm 

277.70 283.73 B: you know when you see like in fancy restaurants and they'll have something carved out of a or made into a rose 

283.12 284.64 A: mhm mhm 

283.88 286.62 B: okay i can do all that i've got a 

285.18 290.56 A: oh th- those are so pretty and does it does it take a lot of time to do it 

289.87 294.95 B: it takes a lot of time to learn it but once you learn it it's very simple 

291.73 292.71 A: yeah 

293.28 294.27 A: mhm 

294.46 295.55 A: (( oh okay )) 

295.15 300.93 B: it really is 'cause it all just makes sense i took a class over here at our local college at night 

297.29 298.40 A: mhm 

299.93 301.14 A: oh okay 

301.09 309.60 B: and the lady was wonderful and then i bought all the books that i could find on it and then some of the books they're smart they sell it to you with the tools 

302.68 303.88 A: mhm 

305.22 306.76 A: mhm mhm 

309.17 311.19 A: oh that's good 

310.58 315.08 B: oh you have everything but i that's what i enjoy 

312.18 313.59 A: mhm 

313.62 317.12 A: so do you mostly do that when you have company or something like that 

316.53 320.31 B: no i do it every night if i'm fixing my husband dinner at home 

319.78 320.89 A: oh okay 

320.64 326.46 B: i will fix it i will do something attractive he always goes the plate is so attractive 

325.81 327.20 A: mhm 

326.56 329.32 B: because i like the difference of the colors 

328.87 331.02 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

329.52 336.08 B: you know so you know we'll got out like basically for lunch during the week because we work together too 

333.27 334.21 A: mhm 

335.63 337.39 A: oh okay 

336.29 346.79 B: and then a couple of dinners a week but the nights that i'll fix him even his breakfast plate i'll put a decoration with a with a orange slice twisted on it 

341.73 342.64 A: mhm 

346.06 350.32 A: that is so sweet [laughter] 

347.44 351.23 B: [laughter] 

350.49 353.75 A: you are so creative [laughter] 

351.99 365.19 B: [laughter] it just gives it that other extra little touch and then i always ask if who ordered the number four at this table [laughter] 

354.45 355.01 A: (( [sigh] )) 

357.03 358.02 A: yeah 

360.78 366.78 A: [laughter] yeah 

365.63 376.02 B: but it just seems i don't know it seems like as you get older too you eat less and less and what happens is you wind up taking it home you take half of it home 

369.09 370.06 A: mhm 

373.79 374.77 A: yeah 

375.55 380.90 A: i do whenever we go out i usually take some home mhm if they give you 

376.36 377.35 B: i do 

378.73 382.27 B: right because then you get another meal out of it [laughter] 

381.89 386.59 A: i know i know and i keep it for lunch the next day or something like that 

386.00 395.35 B: exactly exactly so that- that's that's the same thing that we do here you know it's funny probably all across the country people do this well it- 

386.71 388.16 A: mhm 

390.94 392.13 A: mhm 

394.36 396.24 A: i think so mhm 

395.35 401.41 B: they said this group well when i read about it on the internet that there was going to be like five people in the group 

401.49 402.62 A: really 

402.03 403.46 B: did you read that 

403.58 415.18 A: mm no we- i read something about later on when they finish this they'll have like more calls or something like that but i just thought it would be just two people you know doing a conversation 

414.74 417.58 B: okay so let's talk about food 

417.00 418.89 A: yeah okay 

417.66 420.36 B: we we don't even know how long we've talked 

420.20 427.38 A: uh they- they'll let you know after eight minutes then they give you like thirty seconds to say goodbye so i guess we're still 

426.15 429.09 B: and then do they call you back or what do they do 

428.54 438.67 A: mm mm it it just ends and then they like you know um make a notation i guess of that you talked um you know however many calls you can talk like three total i think 

438.55 439.59 B: i see 

439.12 441.46 A: mhm and then they you know keep a 

440.48 442.60 B: and then they just send you a check 

442.26 456.21 A: right right i haven't gotten mine yet but um i s- did a couple like a couple of months ago but my friend said that um he got his because you know he was the one who told me about it but he says they're good about paying so i guess we won't have to worry about that 

442.81 443.74 B: (( cool mhm )) 

455.90 465.80 B: yes and i hope they're listening [laughter] 'cause those internet ladies that love food [laughter] have to make some extra money now and again 

457.34 461.54 A: [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah [laughter] 

461.90 463.58 A: [laughter] 

464.89 471.99 A: that's right so that we can go out and by the things that we need to cook it with [laughter] 

466.94 468.03 B: and eat 

468.39 482.50 B: [laughter] exactly exactly i never i never really think to go to fine dining restaurants either though you know because we have one on ventura boulevard which is very close to the studios 

472.90 473.74 A: [laughter] 

476.59 477.58 A: mhm 

482.38 489.91 B: and when they first opened we zoomed on by and got a menu and i was shocked at the prices 

486.39 487.34 A: mhm 

489.22 495.16 A: oh i know i know they are they can be astronomical that's another thing that 

491.21 492.66 B: you know i mean 

493.54 498.09 B: you know where do they come off charging seventeen dollars for a salad 

497.80 500.77 A: i know that's ridiculous mhm 

498.23 508.99 B: it's it's outrageous you know so i don't i don't wind up going to those places and i also don't wind up going to places that's buffet now because of all the sicknesses 

502.74 503.76 A: me either 

508.37 512.32 A: i know i know it's scary with those you know and then 

512.34 517.94 A: everybody is touching the same utensil you know so you need to wash your hands again before you eat 

517.96 519.32 B: exactly 

518.73 528.23 A: yeah i don't i don't really like those at first they were really big like you know in the um early eighties and nineties but um i'm getting away from them because uh 

527.33 531.50 B: yeah i don't think that they're safe because you always hear of food poisoning to 

530.75 532.63 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

531.62 537.21 B: do with those kind of places and boy that that's not for me i've had that once already at a sizzler 

533.05 533.96 A: yeah 

536.73 539.63 A: ooh i know that's awful 

537.51 538.59 B: and i 

538.98 550.13 B: i never want that again you know but with oh yeah well there's just too many sicknesses they said that's a sneeze guard i don't know a lot of people are shorter than that [laughter] 

540.57 541.49 A: (( mm )) 

544.86 545.89 A: yeah 

548.07 558.32 A: that's true that's true and all those hands and everything that's touching i i don't really like i i sort of prefer we usually like to go to like ruby tuesday or 

557.54 559.16 B: what's ruby tuesday 

558.70 560.66 A: oh ruby tuesday it's um 

560.73 567.69 A: it's like an upscale restaurant it's not really all that expensive they have like um you can get uh veggie burgers burgers uh fries 

566.58 568.10 B: do they have alcohol 

567.76 568.96 A: (( ah yeah )) 

568.56 569.66 B: oh good 

569.03 570.25 A: salad bar 

570.76 575.91 A: and [noise] just a variety of things and it's the prices are pretty reasonable 

575.96 580.81 A: so two people can eat for like i guess about twenty five twenty six dollars 

576.15 577.23 B: yeah well that 

580.35 583.86 B: oh uh that's like t._g._i._f. or something like that 

582.70 585.55 A: yeah it is it's a lot like that mhm 

583.87 586.62 B: yeah yeah okay okay 

585.77 586.68 A: yeah 

586.64 597.13 B: yeah we have places like that too you know but the thing with the veggie burgers they always cook them right next to those uh meat patties and they use the same spatula 

588.53 589.57 A: mhm 

594.27 595.50 A: mhm 

596.93 598.64 A: mhm yeah 

597.54 599.95 B: and if restaurants would learn that
