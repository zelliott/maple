15.94 17.23 B: (( no )) 

16.79 17.86 A: okay 

17.36 21.94 B: i mean i thought maybe i'd talk to somebody who's from the deep south or [laughter] 

20.51 22.07 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

22.13 23.53 A: (( well okay [noise] )) 

22.29 25.08 B: so we're supposed to talk about friends huh 

24.77 30.74 A: yeah we're supposed to talk about our best friends or because i only have the one real close 

25.91 27.32 B: [sigh] well [sigh] 

28.72 29.75 B: yeah 

30.75 32.93 B: well you want to go first [laughter] 

31.75 34.14 A: friend um well 

34.43 42.73 A: yeah i'll go first um she's her name is kelly williams um i've known her for about six years now 

35.56 36.74 B: (( okay mhm [noise] [mn] )) 

42.83 48.66 A: met her when i was going to um school we were in the same program together 

49.17 57.57 A: and um she's been a real close friend and i think the only reason why we are the best of friends is because we don't spend too much time together 

57.11 59.68 B: [laughter] 

57.83 62.10 A: [noise] um [cough] we have um she has a nine year old son 

62.24 70.08 A: and i have a six year old and a three year old so sometimes the six year old and the nine year old get together and play [noise] and 

69.09 69.92 B: mhm 

70.01 77.49 A: we do [noise] you know every once in a while do special things together and stuff but it might be two or three times a month 

77.78 80.40 A: but we talk to each other on the phone 

80.69 82.57 A: probably about 

82.81 87.41 A: once every two weeks and we talk for a while when we do 

87.50 102.09 A: but you know we leave each other messages email all the time and stuff but like if i have a problem she'll talk to me about it if she has a problem she'll talk you know i'll talk to her and so it's just like you know i think that's the reason why we're such close friends we just went out to lunch together 

91.60 92.76 B: mhm 

102.27 112.19 A: the other day so we do that e- once once a month so i think that's the reason why we stay pretty close but she's the my only friend that i can really really confide in 

112.41 114.79 B: mhm wow does she live close to you 

114.73 119.79 A: yes she lives probably about ten minutes away [laughter] yeah 

117.25 121.14 B: oh yeah [laughter] you're probably just very busy like we are 

120.38 122.34 A: mhm oh yes she's very busy 

122.39 124.91 B: yeah wow 

125.13 131.31 B: well i asked [mn] kind of i was trying to think real quick about what my answer to that question was whether 

131.36 137.93 B: i have more acquaintances and just lots of friends or or close friends i don't know i think i have both 

134.46 135.76 A: mhm 

137.55 138.42 A: really 

138.21 140.67 B: i have a lot of acquaintances like 

141.08 146.20 B: i have a home business and so i talk to a lot of people on the phone too that have become 

142.93 144.10 A: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

146.28 149.57 B: good friends that i i haven't necessarily met [laughter] 

149.08 150.04 A: right 

149.66 152.10 B: but i talk to them on the phone all the time 

152.35 157.52 B: and i guess my best friend though lives in the same area here and i i 

157.68 163.15 B: guess kinda like yours i haven't i don't see her that often i see her more now than i used to but 

161.03 161.98 A: mhm 

163.35 167.59 B: i've known her for probably nine years and we met at our church 

165.44 166.39 A: (( oh okay )) 

167.93 172.93 B: and she's got a daughter that's sixteen and a daughter that's 

172.96 174.28 B: six [laughter] 

174.05 175.10 A: (( oh okay )) 

174.58 177.48 B: and um i have five children so 

177.52 178.43 A: (( okay mhm )) 

178.40 185.53 B: um our kids don't really play together or we don't we don't go to the same school district or anything anymore so 

186.40 188.62 B: [lipsmack] but ah she actually just 

188.75 192.61 B: just bought one of my puppies [laughter] we have puppies so 

191.53 192.57 A: oh okay 

192.70 202.07 B: so i've been talking to her a lot lately [laughter] but yeah we go out we go out for lunch too and that kinda thing and um 

194.69 195.37 A: (( mm )) 

202.35 206.46 B: i think [mn] our philosophy of life is pretty similar so 

206.00 206.78 A: mhm 

206.47 213.06 B: that's probably we get along really well i know that pretty much the way i think about things is the way she [laughter] does too so 

212.65 213.86 A: oh that's good 

213.45 215.62 B: that makes it you know we don't really 

215.70 218.68 B: have any any disagreements about anything 

218.95 223.14 B: except maybe child rearing sometimes [laughter] 

221.63 223.69 A: (( mhm right [mn] yeah )) 

223.41 231.19 B: i'm a lot more loose than she is when it comes to kids she's very a lot more structured and i guess maybe that's good [laughter] 

225.71 226.48 A: (( oh okay )) 

226.66 228.36 A: [laughter] 

229.90 231.25 A: (( uh-huh okay )) 

231.39 232.86 B: (( [sigh] ooh i )) 

233.45 238.31 B: was thinking about long distance and i think even back to high school and college friends um 

238.98 243.92 B: i still there are still people i feel really close to that i don't talk to very often at all 

243.82 246.08 A: oh really from high school 

244.53 245.89 B: but when we g- 

245.90 252.96 B: yeah but still when we get together it you know once in a great while it still seems like 

246.65 247.51 A: really 

253.14 258.36 B: um we've never been separated i just still feel really close to 'em so 

255.37 256.08 A: (( mm )) 

258.31 259.64 A: that's good 

259.58 260.49 B: yeah 

259.80 263.31 A: i don't have my high school friends i don't um 

263.77 272.73 A: we had a reunion [sigh] like about ten fifteen years ago but i still i don't really talk to any of 'em i hear about some of 'em 

272.36 273.70 B: mhm 

272.99 276.54 A: through my relatives that live in the same town but um 

276.15 277.37 B: right 

276.97 278.07 A: i don't 

278.56 287.62 A: really associate -ate with them at all there is one particular girl that um kept trying to get a hold of me and i was always doing something where i just couldn't 

287.74 290.10 A: really call her back and um 

289.21 290.34 B: mhm 

290.88 294.20 A: once in a while i would call back and we just lost touch period 

294.16 295.28 B: yeah 

294.62 298.03 A: but that's pretty good if you can keep up with your high school friends 

297.56 308.18 B: well it's just like like you say it's one that there's one in particular that i was really close to and [lipsmack] and she lives in iowa so it's not real far apart in fact in 

308.43 323.11 B: um few years ago our two oldest daughters were really good friends and we used to kinda send them back and forth and they would spend some time at the other one's house for a week or so in the summer so we haven't done that in a long time so 

320.46 321.64 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

322.63 323.31 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

324.26 328.67 B: [sigh] she's somebody i've been thinking about a lot lately that i should probably call her [laughter] 

327.78 328.81 A: (( nice )) 

329.46 330.36 B: (( but i )) 

329.52 331.17 A: that's [mn] that'd be nice 

330.98 338.38 B: yeah my college i don't know my college friends all seem to have moved far away and 

332.04 332.78 A: (( [cough] )) 

338.72 348.03 B: i even speak to them less the internet really helps if i do email and you know my best friend from college just had a baby so i just heard about that [mn] 

341.82 342.70 A: yeah 

342.84 343.64 A: (( [laughter] mm mm )) 

348.83 354.15 B: but she got married way later than i did so we didn't have a lot in common for a long time 

353.83 354.90 A: oh okay 

354.88 356.73 B: you know she lived here but 

357.78 360.47 B: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] i don't know i i )) 

360.63 374.53 B: didn't ever think i was really [laughter] the social person for a long time till like i say i started doing the home business thing and [sigh] and now i i've been kinda thrown in to having to talk to a lot of different people and and making friends 

364.19 365.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

373.26 374.69 A: well i'm the same way 

374.84 380.03 A: [noise] i have a hard time socializing usually [mn] i think i'm a kinda shy person 

377.06 378.18 B: yeah 

379.54 388.55 B: kind of a homebody i would just as soon sit at home with a book [laughter] 'cause my husband doesn't really like going out or anything either so 

380.90 381.83 A: uh-huh 

383.90 386.13 A: yes [laughter] 

388.51 389.98 A: well that's good 

389.32 391.52 B: um yeah it is 

391.23 392.84 A: mhm 

391.79 404.58 B: it is we we've just finally over the last and we've been married [sigh] eighteen years and we've just finally over the last two years started to have really more couple friends that we do 

402.79 404.06 A: yeah

408.30 415.43 B: for a long time we didn't even do that i just had some girlfriends and he had some guy friends and we didn't really have friends together so 

412.45 413.69 A: mhm

419.66 423.38 B: i have friends who actually have families like we do and
