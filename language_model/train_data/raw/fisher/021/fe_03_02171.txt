1.57 3.28 B: (( hi my name's adam )) 

2.89 3.97 A: hi adam 

4.52 6.15 B: hi so um 

6.28 8.26 B: what's your opinion on the question 

7.72 13.74 A: uh my opinion will be t- um in home and the best probably will be italian 

13.66 15.81 B: yeah i'd say 

16.13 17.26 B: um 

17.58 19.86 B: i guess it probably all depends on the day 

19.70 20.73 A: okay 

19.95 21.48 B: but um 

22.80 36.06 B: uh like if i i'm at college right now and if i hadn't if i haven't been home in a while then i'd definitely rather eat at home but with my friends i'd rather we just go out i think um 

29.83 30.87 A: okay 

36.12 40.56 B: and my ideal meal would probably be italian food as well 'cause i'm a pretty picky eater though 

38.69 39.61 A: okay 

39.96 41.84 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

41.92 43.49 B: [laughter] 

42.73 46.13 A: where are you located are you lo- uh locally in california adam 

45.82 47.73 B: [cough] uh i'm in virginia actually 

46.96 49.21 A: oh virginia okay okay 

47.90 51.63 B: yeah i'm from new york but um i got to school in virginia 

49.35 50.21 A: okay 

51.04 52.19 A: i got it 

51.90 53.51 B: yeah so 

53.90 56.61 B: um how come you prefer to eat at home 

56.03 59.67 A: [lipsmack] uh i'm a house wife so i'd rather cook at home 

59.37 60.20 B: (( mm )) 

59.74 65.35 A: and i'd rather eat uh something that is healthy and uh you know prop- uh fresh 

65.58 68.82 A: so that's basically the reason i choose the second option 

68.74 69.90 B: yeah 

69.27 70.64 A: [laughter] 

69.98 71.63 B: i think that um 

72.50 79.06 B: i don't know like sometimes i feel like uh because my mom um 

79.15 82.48 B: is like at work some days until late so some days [cough] 

83.12 89.19 B: um if she comes home like after a meeting or whatever i think i'd rather just go out just because i feel bad that like 

85.42 86.23 A: uh-huh 

88.54 94.10 A: you don't want to bother her been to cooking for you okay [laughter] that's understandable 

90.24 91.78 B: yeah [laughter] 

92.04 93.15 B: um 

93.50 99.40 B: yeah but like i don't know 'cause it sometimes a lot of it i guess uh 

99.93 102.25 B: we eat out a lot of the time so 

102.42 115.37 B: um there's a there's like certain restaurants back home that like are almost like eating at home you know like with somewhere so many that it's just like you know we know the people who work there and like um 

109.54 110.73 A: oh yeah 

114.73 118.05 A: you trust their c- c- their cooker [laughter] 

116.79 119.39 B: yeah [laughter] um 

119.68 122.33 B: but yeah i don't know 

122.90 125.69 B: uh eating at home though is definitely nice 

125.11 132.17 A: [sigh] more beneficial it's more healthier you know what is in you know and s- and what uh they're putting into and 

126.80 127.70 B: yeah 

129.17 130.35 B: right 

131.87 132.96 B: yeah 

132.09 141.95 A: it's fresh so [sigh] um i if i had the option if i was working out definitely my s- my my option would have been eating out too but i'd rather um eat at home 

141.77 142.89 B: yeah 

142.25 143.48 A: for that reason 

143.47 144.53 B: um 

143.55 144.36 A: so what 

145.55 148.29 B: i don't know i think that like 

148.81 161.79 B: there's something to be said for both but like when you're eating at home it's kind of nice 'cause like you know the atmosphere is like it's your house and like um you're just sitting your focus is just sitting their with your family and like it's kind of nice 

159.57 161.00 A: exactly 

161.85 164.92 B: [cough] like on holidays and stuff um 

166.11 170.27 B: you we have this like tradition of definitely eating at home for like every meal 

168.85 169.76 A: mhm 

170.00 170.98 A: okay 

170.30 172.54 B: like at on holidays but um 

174.22 177.23 B: i don't know like i think a couple of years ago 

177.21 179.71 B: um we'd started going out to eat 

179.54 192.77 B: and like on thanksgiving i don't really like doing that too much um but because like my grandparents are like kind of sick and like they'd rather just like go out and like them have to be like around like preparing and like um 

182.27 183.34 A: (( mhm )) 

192.96 196.21 B: my mom offers to but they're like no let's just go out you know 

196.30 197.51 B: (( um [cough] )) 

197.64 199.81 B: me and my sister always talk about it and like 

200.24 207.89 B: we definitely would prefer to just eat at home um same thing with like christmas i'd say too but um 

202.69 203.69 A: right 

208.95 219.28 B: i don't know it it all depends because like my family's just like this italian family and like if we go out to like an italian restaurant that like we've been to like a million times then i like doing that too 

215.87 216.70 A: uh-huh 

219.17 220.15 A: uh-huh 

219.64 220.70 B: um 

220.78 228.72 B: if we're just going to like somewhere like a regular place that like isn't like i don't know i just associate like italian food with like um 

228.83 230.76 B: like christmas eve dinner 

230.24 234.51 A: eve uh-huh wh- what is your background adam are you um 

234.53 238.27 A: uh do you have an italian background or its just yeah you're just 

236.76 241.75 B: yeah um half my half my family [cough] is italian 

241.29 242.83 A: oh they are okay 

242.38 250.43 B: um and my mom's side is kind of mixed but um yeah i'm definitely majority italian 

249.81 250.81 A: huh 

250.87 251.43 B: (( [cough] )) 

250.88 252.05 A: interesting 

251.53 252.90 B: but um 

253.86 264.77 B: so i was just kind of like raised in that environment you know i'm like my italian grandma lived with us for like i think eight years so i'm used to like hearing like people speaking italian you know 

256.29 257.69 A: mhm 

264.06 265.61 A: [laughter] 

265.08 269.59 B: um her cooking like authentic type meals and stuff like that so 

267.76 280.68 A: right exactly well my background i'm persian so we e- eat a lot of persian food too but um you know i said um option definitely italian is my i love you know um italian foods and stuff 

271.35 272.17 B: mhm 

274.65 275.98 B: (( hm )) 

280.14 282.02 B: yeah 

281.66 282.54 A: so 

282.96 285.82 B: yeah on my mother's side it's like 

286.12 289.11 B: um it's like half german and then 

289.12 296.55 B: a quarter or an eighth no yeah so i guess that would be like a quarter of me is german and then i'm like an eighth is 

294.23 295.83 A: german okay 

296.69 299.25 B: like french canadian or something and then the rest is 

298.57 300.02 A: (( oh my god )) 

300.02 307.06 B: so it's like that side i mean like if we were to eat like authentic german food i i don't think i'd really like it [laughter] 

306.32 309.48 A: [laughter] that's interesting 

307.37 308.39 B: um 

309.44 314.10 B: well i don't know if i could i barely eat like american food but it's like mostly italian is what i 

313.74 323.48 A: i mean em em er you know american food is um there's they really don't have much of a it's all burgers and and for me it's very un- unhealthy food 

319.89 321.27 B: right 

323.24 325.01 B: yeah 

323.91 326.49 A: but um that's interesting
