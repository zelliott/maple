165.31 171.53 A: ah lemon juice or lime juice or just regular lime ah lemon juice and that's it 

166.39 167.35 B: mhm 

171.33 172.78 B: oh well that's easy 

172.51 174.58 A: the w- ah sometimes i 

174.67 179.71 A: ah add ah little bit of chopped onion and then the fresh onion 

178.47 180.42 B: mhm mhm 

179.82 181.35 A: how do you cook it 

180.94 187.09 B: well i've started poaching it and i found i really like that um i've been poaching it in wine 

184.54 185.48 A: oh 

187.10 187.90 A: oh 

187.23 201.57 B: and i mean that's about as easy as it gets [laughter] you just bring a little wine to a boil and [sigh] throw in the fish and ten minutes later it's done and it really gives it a nice flavor and i generally add a little lemon juice to the to the wine too 

189.75 191.45 A: oh yeah it's 

197.85 198.66 A: (( ah )) 

200.17 202.29 A: (( good yeah yes ahah )) 

202.33 207.86 A: and ah is this how they cook it in the restaurant too which is very tasty 

205.84 207.04 B: sometimes 

207.11 221.32 B: um actually that was the first place i had it when i started on my health food kick the first time i ever ordered salmon it was poached and i loved it i said oh my gosh th- and i had never thought to make it that way it's just it's so simple 

215.05 216.00 A: (( ahah )) 

219.41 220.70 A: really that's 

220.96 228.84 A: that's the first time i'm hearing poaching ah i i'm wonder if you can do with any other ah fish also 

224.26 226.20 B: it's very good that way 

228.48 238.65 B: yeah you can but salmon's about the best and ah you know why one thing it does is you know salmon's kind of fatty it it sort of takes a little bit of the fat out of it too 

235.14 235.95 A: (( ahah )) 

236.71 241.82 A: (( oh discard it that's true yes that's true yes yes )) 

239.67 240.85 B: yeah 

241.43 255.80 B: but it it really gives it a nice i i like the flavor of fish anyway you know i'm a i am i really do enjoy fish but that gives it a little bit you know it's a nice mild flavor and you don't really taste the wine it just give the fish a a very nice flavor 

245.11 245.95 A: (( ahah )) 

247.46 248.74 A: (( yes ahah ahah )) 

254.29 259.31 A: the fish is a little bit yeah when you cook the wine you it goes away the alcohol goes away 

257.72 262.83 B: right right and you're boiling it so all it does is really give you the liquid 

261.85 269.65 A: yes that's give's a different flavor yeah so ah when you go to the restaurant what do you order you order seaf- 

263.86 265.15 B: yeah 

269.80 271.48 A: (( food or you order ahah )) 

270.62 285.02 B: yes if i think it'll be good yeah [laughter] yeah well like i said it's hard to get good seafood around here but we do have a couple of restaurants that are are very you know good with seafood and yeah that's probably my preference and i'll or-
