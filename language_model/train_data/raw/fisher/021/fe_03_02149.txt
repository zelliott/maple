104.57 111.04 B: too often i find ah when i'm eating a good meal in a good restaurant that it's pretty much home cooking [noise] 

111.14 122.06 B: um [noise] and i'm not like a cordon bleu ch- chef but [noise] i i think the greatest gift you can give yourself is a good meal [noise] ah by that i mean you know prepare it yourself

122.62 132.27 B: so i [mn] i i i'm not personally comparing but i i've had meals in restaurants where i've though this is not as good as what i would have done myself

145.53 159.35 B: sometimes to have the the same meal again because it's so good but um ah i ah i prefer actually to to to eat at home [noise] and prepare my own meal and it's sort of a money thing because ah 

149.04 150.50 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

159.23 167.95 B: um often times ah w- what i'll pay for a meal i think you know okay they've got to pay the help [noise] and they gotta pay [noise] the chef and they gotta pay the staff [noise] [sigh] 

167.85 179.29 B: but i could knock this meal together for a fraction of what i just paid for it but then it it's the pleasure of being with the people you're having the meal with [noise] and the occasion the occasion that you know gets you there in [noise] first place [noise] 

174.68 175.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] exactly )) 

179.20 180.29 A: (( right right [noise] [noise] [noise] ))

284.10 285.28 B: um 

289.41 290.35 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah ))

295.66 302.44 B: well i mean just just [noise] a really good book ah ah again just browsing through it [noise] and seeing [noise] if what [noise] what 

302.71 315.32 B: the person is writing about sound like [noise] what you'd [noise] like to eat [noise] that's almost a fair [noise] indication but ah [noise] yeah i mean convenience [noise] is definitely [noise] a factor there's no doubt about it [noise] um [noise] and i think maybe [noise] i don't know ah 

307.17 308.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

315.53 326.77 B: two of the [noise] four meals i have out are on expenses but ah yeah well that [noise] eases [noise] some of the pain [noise] um [noise] and [noise] and and [noise] the food [noise] is generally good [noise] um
