241.11 250.39 A: [laughter] no i guess they say when people get married like your your friends they're not they don't change but it's not like i guess uh 

250.68 254.61 A: it's not as important as it used to be especially when you start getting married and having kids 

255.11 260.55 B: yeah because ideally the the person that you're married to should be your best friend 

259.91 261.07 A: gotcha 

260.76 263.30 B: but you still should have your friends 

263.52 265.31 B: your own friends too 

265.18 267.87 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

265.69 270.30 B: yeah it's not see i made that mistake when i was married that um 

270.86 283.57 B: i i didn't want my um husband to have friends that weren't my friends too you know i didn't want him to go out without me i thought his friends invited him i ought to be able to go along too 

283.25 284.11 A: (( mm )) 

284.16 291.17 B: so i would really nag him and not want him to go out and stuff so now i now i really regret that and 

291.03 305.18 B: now my nineteen year old daughter has gotten married and so i've given her some advice about that you know let her husband have his friends [laughter] he's kinda taking advantage of it and going out partying every night but he's only twenty one so 

301.50 303.31 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

306.06 309.48 B: but um she's letting him have his friends 

310.06 314.87 B: it it's important you can't make the other person your your whole world 

314.63 327.24 A: yeah yeah i can't really imagine myself getting people always ask yeah don't you in terms of like meeting new friends but i can't really imagine myself i really don't even search for you know making new friends 'cause the ones i have you know 

327.40 330.12 A: pretty content with them 

329.45 330.41 B: yeah 

331.13 333.05 B: yeah it usually 

333.06 338.10 B: when you get new friends it's more when you enter different activities like 

338.21 344.71 B: me with my my running it seems like my running friends kind of come and go you know like 

344.90 357.73 B: like i'll be running with somebody for a while and then i don't know they'll move or they quit running or whatever my my best friend that i was telling you about um we were co captains on the cross country team 

357.88 359.61 B: in high school so 

360.01 362.32 B: she actually got me um 

362.40 365.82 B: running my first marathon when i was 

365.92 367.68 B: (( i was like about thirty one )) 

367.87 370.25 B: um she'd been walking 

368.26 372.23 A: (( yeah )) 

370.41 375.95 B: kinda running walking the l. a. marathon for several years and then she got me doing it but she's [noise] 

376.18 379.58 B: had some injuries since and she's not running anymore but 

380.34 381.45 B: but um 

381.77 387.32 B: but i have a number of friends that've been in you know in that running circle and then 

387.78 393.23 B: you know have a lot of a acquaintances because um i'm a musician so 

394.14 398.32 B: you know people i play in the orchestra with and 

398.38 400.75 B: and teach with and stuff but 

402.50 406.50 B: and and of course my boyfriend's one of my best friends too 

406.78 418.69 A: [noise] [noise] yeah and i guess also like um i i've actually when i think about like when i would have a new job or something you make your friends there and hang out with them for a while and you and i guess you kinda of and then if you go to a new job or 

414.61 415.53 B: yeah 

418.96 433.83 A: [mn] you go to a new job you're kind of stay in touch with them for a while but it's never like i guess i've never really stayed in touch with them more than a couple of months after i left [laughter] 

426.84 434.23 B: yeah yeah it's funny how it happens it was just like when when i went to my reunion you know we all like ex- exchanged 

434.17 442.82 B: email addresses a lot of us well have i gotten any emails from any of them [laughter] you know and have i sent them any no [laughter] 

441.97 442.75 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

443.17 446.71 B: so i guess we didn't all want to stay in touch that badly [laughter] 

446.01 454.12 A: yeah i think the email address is like yeah that's the that's the way of saying ah maybe i'll stay in touch it's it's not the same as i guess exchanging phone numbers 

454.55 455.48 B: yeah 

454.65 459.48 A: 'cause it's like you have it's like the easiest thing to do but also the most mundane 

459.96 462.82 A: so most people don't do it yeah 

460.11 461.12 B: yeah 

461.81 465.55 B: true but then you know you have like some friends that even though they're 

465.93 471.26 B: they move away like they're still your you still consider them like your best friend even if you 

471.39 473.91 B: don't get to see them much like i have 

473.92 480.95 B: another friend from high school and you know she's been in bakersfield for a couple of years and um 

481.21 490.67 B: but you know she's we still call each other you know maybe three or four times a year and she came to my daughter's wedding and you know it was just like

521.82 522.71 B: (( um you know )) 

523.02 525.22 B: some several years back we
