87.03 89.89 A: five and a half years and um 

89.95 99.69 A: we hooked up about a year after that uh we the first year we lived in live in a neighborhood that was newly built and so the first year was really really busy for both of us getting 

99.63 107.89 A: organized and you know fixing our yards up and stuff like that and about a year after that we started walking together and have been together ever since 

107.83 108.96 B: super 

108.84 115.15 A: so and our husbands get along so it's easy for us to you know get together as groups and get and do things 

114.54 117.59 B: oh yeah that makes it nice 

115.81 116.64 A: so 

116.92 118.15 A: yeah it does

132.37 134.26 A: oh yeah imagine 

134.77 148.13 A: you know like uh we've been that way too quite a bit i mean anytime one of us needs to talk we say okay it's time to walk [laughter] even if we've already done it yeah exactly i trust her with anything that i had to say and vice versa 

141.12 143.36 B: yeah and you can say anything 

148.10 153.29 B: yeah you don't have to worry about any repercussions 

148.72 149.57 A: so 

152.69 153.82 A: exactly 

153.93 155.16 A: exactly 

155.37 164.40 A: and even though you know we are friends as couples also we can still you know go to each other and complain about our spouses without worrying about it 

164.11 165.11 B: yeah 

165.27 166.81 A: that makes it real nice 

166.87 170.66 B: yeah you've got to have somebody that you can sort of bounce things off of 

170.46 172.04 A: exactly 

170.70 172.43 B: i feel anyway 

172.08 173.27 A: exactly 

173.01 176.47 B: you don't want to go round forever you know with things pent up 

177.28 179.96 A: it makes it a lot healthier [laughter] 

177.71 178.72 B: i have a 

179.11 180.15 B: yeah 

180.26 185.83 B: well i have a room mate situation and i've known her for about fifteen years and um

189.51 192.20 A: yeah [laughter] 

190.65 195.40 B: [laughter] i'm actually renting a room in her house but i get the whole house for six months 

192.96 193.91 A: yeah 

195.05 196.18 A: wow 

195.48 198.20 B: she's due back the fifteenth of may

204.92 206.03 B: (( but we )) 

206.25 212.94 B: oh yeah and we're good friends but we're it's funny we can live under the same roof 

209.02 210.54 A: right 

213.04 219.01 B: um for six months out of the year but we're not best friends we're not bosom buddies you know 

216.56 217.40 A: right 

218.67 219.89 A: exactly 

219.59 222.83 B: it it's really strange i can't tell her everything 

222.58 224.06 A: right 

223.06 226.99 B: i just don't feel comfortable doing that and we live together 

225.11 226.55 A: right 

226.90 234.26 A: right i did the same thing there was one girl that lived with me for a while right after i bought my first house and um 

227.81 228.74 B: so 

234.37 238.00 A: we were better friends when we were not living together 

238.56 253.41 A: we did more things together when we weren't living together than when we were living together because we worked together and lived together and it i guess it just became where we were together too much and so we ended up kinda growing apart because of that and um 

248.29 249.44 B: yeah 

253.75 261.36 A: you know it it seems to be easier to be able to walk away at the same time you know have a best friend that you don't have to be around twenty four hours a day or whatever 

260.96 266.32 B: yeah it's true [mn] i do do more with her now that i sort of live 

262.25 263.09 A: so 

266.38 267.42 B: with her 

267.12 268.86 A: mhm 

267.50 268.97 B: when she's home 

268.88 270.58 A: right 

269.14 270.15 B: um 

270.68 275.67 B: it's terrible i love to cook and show it and she hates to cook 

275.31 278.63 A: [laughter] well that works out good then right 

277.58 281.07 B: [cough] well in a way except she likes to eat out 

280.66 281.54 A: (( oh )) 

281.73 284.34 B: and i can't afford to eat out 

283.66 284.79 A: right 

284.67 287.01 B: but that that's her thing 

286.75 288.59 A: right 

287.25 288.59 B: and um 

290.10 302.50 B: she still wants half the refrigerator she's now on weight watchers and she's counting points so she says remember i'm coming home soon so when you go shopping remember half the freezer's mine and half the refrigerator's mine [laughter] [mn] 

293.26 294.09 A: ah 

294.81 296.49 A: yeah 

297.97 298.71 A: (( [laughter] )) 

301.56 306.25 A: how funny yeah it does take a lot of space to do that weight watchers 'cause i've done that 

306.24 307.17 B: oh 

306.36 309.28 A: and it does if you want to stick to your points you 

309.31 311.52 A: you've got to have the right foods and everything 

311.67 314.83 A: to do it it's hard to do it 

312.60 315.98 B: well she takes up an entire shelf with nothing but water 

315.71 317.46 A: yeah 

316.07 320.00 B: these flavored fruity two os and h. two os 

318.02 320.61 A: oh she does yeah 

320.05 329.66 B: i use plain tap water she's got a well out here see this is her house and that water is ice ice cold even on the hottest days 

323.03 324.29 A: oh wow 

327.26 328.98 A: i bet it's wonderful 

329.34 331.21 A: oh how great 

330.28 331.91 B: it is awesome 

331.92 333.27 A: that's neat 

332.83 334.05 B: but uh 

334.25 337.52 B: i said i take water right out of the tap [laughter] you know 

336.99 339.43 A: yeah see i do too that's how i am 

339.39 341.69 B: i have to have it iced 

339.46 342.25 A: i'd rather have it than flavored right 

342.09 347.19 B: um i i take bottles that used to have water in them 

346.58 347.92 A: exactly 

347.42 350.30 B: and put 'em in the fridge in the freezer 

349.12 350.15 A: right 

350.33 353.03 A: i came across a half gallon 

353.22 354.22 A: um 

354.55 359.71 A: bottle that looks like those big um bottles that sit on top of the container thing 

359.43 360.56 B: oh yeah 

360.38 365.52 A: and it's a half gallon one and it has a little handle and that's what i carry my water in 

366.28 369.18 A: and so it doesn't take up a lot of space in the fridge 

367.19 370.32 B: (( wow that's three and half pounds )) 

370.31 371.17 A: huh 

371.08 373.26 B: that's three and a half pounds 

372.48 381.63 A: to ca- yeah but i carry it like to work and put it on my desk or carry it when i go like i don't carry it like if i'm going shopping or anything but like or i'll keep it in the car 

375.90 377.20 B: oh okay 

380.05 384.85 B: i was picturing you running doing your little walkies and 

381.80 383.25 A: oh no no no no 

383.51 389.75 A: no not when we're walking or anything but um but like if i go to the park or anything like that you know that's what i carry it in 

390.42 394.58 B: well i take mine and put 'em in the freezer half filled with water 

390.45 391.23 A: so 

394.75 400.88 B: and um then when i'm ready to use them i take them out of the freezer and add the rest water 

395.04 396.75 A: mhm 

400.60 401.85 A: yeah 

401.13 407.92 B: and they last a good long time i've got some insulating jackets for a couple of them but not for all of them 

408.16 410.78 A: yeah that's a good idea for when you're walking and stuff 

410.55 412.56 B: yeah and you can 

412.72 420.35 B: they've got them now that come with little uh carabiners on them so you can clip 'em right to your belt i said well you got to get at least two so you're even 

420.43 429.07 A: yeah right so [laughter] so you're not lopsided while you're walking [laughter] that'd be kind of difficult [laughter] specially if you tried to jog or anything [laughter] 

420.43 425.33 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

425.99 427.36 B: yeah
