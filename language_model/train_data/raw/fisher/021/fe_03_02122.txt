119.00 121.91 A: so then i have a lot of acquaintances too but 

122.04 126.96 A: we moved around a lot when i was a kid so i never really got a chance to have life long friends [noise] 

129.09 130.29 B: (( [cough] [noise] mm um i have a lot of )) 

130.62 136.19 B: i think i have probably m- more friends than acquaintances but um 

136.77 144.86 B: it's like i said as the years are going on i'm struggling to they're [laughter] becoming more acquaintances just because [sigh] family time takes up a lot 

141.55 143.42 A: it's hard to make time 

145.08 147.49 A: well family counts as friends too though 

145.38 146.51 B: but that 

147.13 160.45 B: yes absolutely and we moved from idaho so most of our friends are from there and it's hard to i i understand what you're saying moving around a lot it's hard to build a friendship move build a friendship move and [sigh] 

160.43 162.38 B: that's the kind of phase we're in right 

162.29 166.39 A: yeah plus with no time left it's really it gets even harder 

167.39 170.02 A: (( gets even harder yeah )) 

170.12 175.41 A: they make a big difference in in your life but they're also a high maintenance thing too 

175.41 180.31 B: now so oh yes absolutely oh yeah [laughter] speaking of which i just had some friends call tonight to say that they are 

180.39 187.04 B: in laughlin which isn't very far from here it's four hours and they wanted us to drive down and meet them and i said i can't 'cause 

187.14 190.02 A: yeah no kidding not without prior planning 

187.22 197.30 B: it's too far with the kids well and they are going to rent a car and come down and see us and ah you know last minute thing they'll be here tomorrow and we already had plans to do things 

197.39 198.48 A: oh okay 

197.86 202.32 B: but what can you say you can't say no to friends that are gonna rent a car to come down and see you right 

201.76 203.01 A: no

205.93 208.43 B: [laughter] so are you friends with any lakers 

208.40 209.91 A: [laughter] 

208.62 210.52 B: laker fans [laughter] 

211.24 222.53 A: i'm a college basketball fan not so much a pro basketball fan yeah the n._b._a. is pretty much i think of it as bullfighting and i think of college basketball as ballet so 

214.09 215.41 B: an n._b._a. fan 

222.27 223.72 B: (( okay well there you go i'm not very )) 

223.25 225.31 A: i prefer college basketball 

225.41 233.80 B: happy with some of the n._b._a. officially lately but okay [laughter] so i'm with you on that one [laughter] we could be friends [laughter] 

228.14 236.45 A: [laughter] [laughter] so it sounds like you're good sports do you have any college friends 

235.97 238.85 B: um yeah you know my college buddies are my 

239.07 245.04 B: i would say my closest friends but i went to a school in idaho and moved out here so 

244.85 247.40 A: ah okay so you are not much of affecting 

246.11 250.81 B: actually missing college life a little bit and college buddies and [noise] 

250.89 254.70 A: that was easier it was easier to have friends 

254.17 256.31 B: oh absolutely 

255.64 266.14 A: because their job's like what four hours a day or something [laughter] the rest of the time we could study really hard i think but yeah yeah then we could talk 

258.67 261.45 B: yeah oh college 

262.70 264.91 B: yeah stay up all night and 

265.33 279.54 B: drink coffee and [laughter] yeah my college i have one really good friend that came out to arizona and she's studying at one uh getting her doctorate degree out here so i was able to keep in touch with her so 

267.69 269.61 A: yeah 

276.55 278.00 A: oh very cool 

280.39 282.04 A: mm that is good 

280.84 282.08 B: (( that's good so you )) 

282.38 286.44 B: you've college buddies now or you're in back in college or in college oh 

285.39 289.69 A: no actually i was just i don't know oh 'cause i was thinking college basketball 

289.13 290.74 B: okay oh that's right 

290.37 293.65 A: that was that's what made the topic change but yeah it's 

293.73 296.13 A: ah everybody kind of 

296.31 298.14 A: grows away 

297.98 300.64 B: yes the older you get i find that too mhm 

300.27 302.86 A: yeah and then plus 

303.16 312.65 A: my interests have gotten much more refined i was a generalist back then and now i'm not and so it was easier to have a common denominator 

312.94 314.31 B: (( oh right mm )) 

314.30 320.79 A: and now it's harder to find common denominators not impossible because of course everybody's got something in common but 

320.71 334.66 B: [mn] i totally agree well then i think that's why it's harder do th- and just even with as age goes on people are move into the things they want to do and family time a lot of people get married and have kids and 

330.41 331.60 A: (( yes )) 

333.99 343.68 A: and th- those are very specific and focused areas of interest and in order to be with your kids and keep their interest you start getting into what they're into and 

342.64 344.25 B: (( [sigh] absolutely [sigh] )) 

343.86 345.75 A: (( the next thing you know oops )) 

346.19 347.18 B: (( it's hard to )) 

348.88 349.77 B: (( is that our )) 

350.03 352.79 B: was that you- did your phone beep oh that was my phone that beeped sorry 

352.08 353.19 A: oh okay 

353.31 357.50 A: yeah i was wondering i thought maybe our time was up but it seemed like it went by really fast 

356.87 358.61 B: um i was going to say 

359.24 360.95 B: it's hard to um 

361.52 366.57 B: make new f- friends but my neighbour and i have gotten 

366.65 376.17 B: close just two people that would have never been friends ten years ago but common denominator of both stay at home moms and struck up a pretty good friendship through that 

375.86 384.00 A: oh that is that is that is really cool that is really cool 'cause i remember all those sitcoms where neighbors were good friends 

384.69 389.24 A: we have we have an interesting um couple down below us they're french 

389.21 390.10 B: (( yeah oh )) 

389.60 393.90 A: and so it was really cool getting to know them and talking to their kids and everything

410.46 413.31 B: and they yeah and um 

413.61 420.05 B: they they're here this week and so it's the same thing it's so fun to hang out with them and get to know them and their culture and have us over 

419.40 424.72 A: yeah it's a great new way to look at the world and i think that is one thing friends do is 

424.97 430.15 A: you know they've got something in common and yet they are not from family so they've got they don't have the same 

430.39 432.94 A: [mn] prisms and filters and stuff 

432.33 433.38 B: (( yes )) 

433.94 438.62 A: and so you can as listening to their take on the world it was really interesting 

437.94 439.95 B: so i take it you're in an apartment then 

439.76 441.16 A: (( yes [noise] )) 

440.49 441.59 B: so are yo-

464.39 466.34 B: [noise] oh wow how interesting 

465.91 480.30 A: yeah and it really is because i mean a lot of times you see the old guys walking around with all their medals from world war two and you know it really is interesting finding out what they're about they've got a completely different way of doing things like even getting on the bus or 

474.38 475.02 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

480.56 482.36 A: talking to each other 

482.86 490.35 A: [sigh] we had one next door neighbor lady that um she was russian and she fell in love with an african american guy

506.10 514.43 A: oh no not in the comple- although i think our our exact next door neighbour is a vet but he's kind of quiet about it but in the neighborhood definitely 

507.30 508.40 B: oh okay

516.41 518.16 A: [laughter]
