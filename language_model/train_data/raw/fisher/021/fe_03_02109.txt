8.72 15.43 B: uh we're supposed to be talking about friends if we have lots of friends or if we just have acquaintances 

14.93 16.59 A: oh okay okay 

16.84 20.73 A: um well myself i've got quite a few 

20.97 22.07 A: um 

22.25 25.27 A: acquaintances i have a few close friends 

25.43 26.62 A: um 

26.07 28.79 B: are your close friends from growing up 

29.49 33.73 A: [lipsmack] you know i've got a couple that are um but 

34.40 38.68 A: i think the majority of them are like people i go to church with and stuff 

39.07 44.91 A: but um are yours er how how is your friend life [laughter] 

43.95 46.94 B: uh-huh [laughter] um i actually have 

47.50 51.34 B: let's see i would say my best friends are from high school 

50.99 52.11 A: uh-huh 

51.67 64.59 B: and um some of those people have obviously drifted but and then i would say i have a few friends from college um but again we've all drifted into our own direction 

56.45 57.41 A: right 

64.39 65.34 A: right 

64.73 71.25 B: and then i recently moved to a new city in the past two years and i've made a good group of core friends here 

71.15 72.25 A: great 

71.71 83.71 B: but i prefer i used to have a lot of friends and i could never keep in touch with them all but now i just kind of have like i said my core group and that's who i talk to weekly or 

74.75 75.48 A: uh-huh 

83.81 85.04 B: daily 

84.92 86.07 A: right 

86.11 87.95 A: yeah i've got 

87.96 90.63 A: i don't know i have a lot of um 

91.21 97.95 A: [mn] um well i my husband and i have a business and we we have a lot of friends that we 

97.97 102.58 A: deal with through our business too i've made quite a few friends 

102.64 109.36 A: and um i have some that are all over the place in washington and [laughter] 

108.57 111.52 B: oh yeah that's what happens as we get older 

111.31 112.58 A: yeah 

111.97 115.31 B: do you think it's harder as we're older to make friends 

114.94 116.35 A: i think so too 

116.06 117.14 B: yeah [mn] 

116.56 120.65 A: i do personally i think it is yeah but 

119.53 128.28 B: there's not an instant like connection like when you go to high school you're stuck with those people all day or when you go to college you see them in the same classes and the same social outings and then 

122.71 123.63 A: (( mm mm )) 

128.38 136.15 B: if i don't know if you went to graduate school but i did but you still have planned activities but since then it's been very hard to meet new friends 

136.20 139.91 A: yeah i think so too 'cause everybody is so 

140.08 152.83 A: set in just doing their everyday thing and they just and you know do i mean i think it's very rare true best best friend i think is very it's very rare 

143.48 144.67 B: true 

152.43 153.25 B: yes 

153.35 154.55 B: i agree 

153.66 154.22 A: (( um )) 

154.98 159.56 B: i work in a environment where i'm the youngest i'm a school teacher 

159.40 160.47 A: oh okay 

159.59 170.07 B: and i work in a inner city school and most of the teachers actually grew up in that neighborhood and i'm a minority there not just by age but also by race 

161.81 162.81 A: mhm 

165.16 166.26 A: (( mm )) 

169.77 171.03 A: mhm 

170.33 176.93 B: so i don't have i haven't i'm unlike you in that i haven't made friends through my work environment 

176.33 177.75 A: mhm 

177.10 180.61 B: but that's okay because then it's more on a professional level 

180.55 192.80 A: right yeah that's true that's true and i think even in in the work field it's hard to to make friends i mean it it's just it's it's different it 

192.25 193.57 B: mhm 

193.08 195.69 A: is relationships are different 

196.19 199.15 B: (( my parents i go ahead were you going to )) 

196.20 197.06 A: (( but i )) 

198.49 201.18 A: no that's fine go ahead [laughter] 

199.44 205.33 B: [laughter] it's so difficult my parents um met when they were thirteen 

205.46 206.30 A: (( mhm )) 

205.54 213.62 B: and which is very rare but my point of saying that is that they've been each other's best friends since the age of thirteen 

207.93 209.14 A: (( wow wow mhm )) 

213.66 220.39 B: and they have very few couple friends to go out to dinner with or go social you know to social outings with 

220.30 232.22 B: and um we've been discussing my wedding and things and we've been noticing how i don't have that many people to throw showers for me or you know host the brunch or host events because 

232.19 238.42 B: they've just kinda kept to themselves [laughter] so they haven't made many friends because they met at such a young age 

234.26 235.25 A: (( mhm wow right )) 

238.38 239.55 A: wow 

239.62 243.20 A: i know my husband and i we we've been 

243.39 246.85 A: like really good friends i we've been married for 

247.02 252.88 A: um going on a year but we've known each other we've actually been friends for twelve years [laughter] 

249.34 250.31 B: oh 

251.85 254.47 B: (( oh isn't that a neat story yes )) 

253.61 255.93 A: yeah so i mean we've known 

255.07 258.88 B: so a friendship turned into something more in that instance 

257.69 272.69 A: yeah it did it really did and and it's been just the most wonderful thing ever and um i i know that since we we've recently just moved and as well and um we're right now 

272.73 276.70 A: when we moved here we knew nobody at all [laughter] 

275.45 278.83 B: oh wow so you have met a lot of people since you moved 

277.65 290.59 A: yeah we have we really have and our i think our business has helped a lot with that too so that we came we came to a more heavily populated area and we have um 

288.10 289.09 B: uh-huh 

290.47 296.07 A: our our business has really taken off up here and and a lot of people have um 

296.15 301.08 A: um become friends you know sort of kind of through through our business 

300.75 302.29 B: right [mn] 

301.84 307.39 A: i mean of course you have you know the ones that are are more close to you than others but 

306.55 307.61 B: uh-huh 

307.62 308.99 B: (( do you think )) 

309.06 319.16 B: if you were not married you it would be easier to make friends if you moved somewhere new or do you think it's easier being married 'cause you have a partner to go out with to meet other people with 

319.37 322.12 A: you know i i don't know really i 

322.26 324.21 A: (( i don't know 'cause )) 

324.74 325.73 A: um 

326.27 329.65 A: i don't know what do you think about that i don't know [laughter] 

329.25 339.76 B: i think it's hard i i moved here and knew just my best friend and my boyfriend at the time and because they had been here for a year i met all their friends 

339.46 340.55 A: (( mm mhm )) 

339.74 345.24 B: but i think if i moved here by myself i would have been too shy probably to go out 

345.37 346.47 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

345.47 355.36 B: i guess you know i would have joined i joined a running group like you said through your church you've also made friends but i guess by joining different organizations that's an easy way to make friends 

354.38 356.49 A: that's true i think so 

356.05 357.87 B: but it's still hard 

357.83 359.55 A: yeah [laughter] 

358.02 366.22 B: because it's not like that constant companionship and you see 'em all the time 'cause my organizations that i've tried to make new friends with 

362.58 363.46 A: right 

366.33 367.27 B: um 

367.53 372.14 B: it's just not the same i guess 'cause you don't see 'em on a daily basis 

369.71 370.89 A: mhm 

372.29 376.70 A: right that's true that is true and then that's so hard even 

376.71 383.87 A: you know like when you are in school and in college and stuff when you do make those buddies and then you know 

383.93 390.91 A: everybody kind of goes their own way and it's like oh me and you think about somebody it's like i wonder what they're doing i wonder where they're at you know 

389.00 389.66 B: (( [mn] mm )) 

390.13 392.21 B: mhm that's true 

390.97 392.00 A: and 

392.37 395.59 A: because it does it's hard to keep in touch it is 

395.36 399.04 B: it yes it is especially after people start having babies and 

398.37 400.48 A: yeah and get married and 

399.46 401.90 B: [laughter] everyone starts to drift 

401.84 411.99 B: well another aspect of friends uh is um obviously since i'm a teacher i can talk about my students and who i see as friendly and those who are not 

407.63 408.64 A: right 

411.86 419.79 B: and obviously in the friend circle of young children there are the bullies who children are friends with them 'cause they're afraid of them 

419.30 420.38 A: (( ya ya right right )) 

419.93 424.87 B: and then there's the shy children who have no friends 'cause they don't have any social 

424.91 427.36 B: skills i guess may be why 

427.58 436.13 B: but it's very interesting to see the mixture of my classrooms and see who is friends with who and who's singled out 

436.33 437.15 A: right 

437.14 439.74 B: it's kind of sad i don't know if y'all have any children 

439.52 442.29 A: yeah we have we have four actually [laughter] 

441.56 445.90 B: (( oh my do they have a lot of friends or are they young young young )) 

442.31 443.52 A: [laughter] 

444.38 445.20 A: (( um )) 

445.33 448.42 A: they're they're my oldest is nine and 

448.43 461.47 A: he's very well populated i mean he has got friends left and right and it's like people just flock to him but my youngest boy he's seven and he has a really hard time making friends i you know he's like the 

459.92 460.96 B: oh 

461.43 466.76 A: my oldest one's like the leader and my my younger one he's kind of like the follower and he 

465.95 467.08 B: uh-huh 

466.87 479.64 A: he's really cautious with who he hangs out with and and does things with you know and um he's more cautious than my oldest one my oldest one just kinda does i don't know 

479.57 486.10 A: i don't know if you would even call my oldest one a leader he might be kind of a follower [laughter] 'cause he kind of does whatever anybody else does but 

485.31 490.29 B: but is he more he's more outgoing than the younger son the youngest 

487.27 500.44 A: yeah well somewhat i mean my other one is too they both play a lot of sports and stuff like that so they make friends you know through their sports but it just seems like my oldest one he's just got that natural 

500.39 504.43 A: i don't know friend making thing going on or something [laughter] 'cause he 

503.33 505.19 B: (( that's interesting )) 

504.75 511.76 A: yeah it is it's it's and my two girls they're younger they're like five and four so their friends kind of just 

512.24 519.73 A: [mn] i don't know if you my my five year old she made her first real true friend i think this year in kindergarten and 

520.31 523.87 A: um she's been calling her and stuff [laughter] you know and 

520.79 521.91 B: how cute 

523.27 527.14 B: oh really they talk on the phone at that age okay i didn't know 

524.06 524.99 A: yeah 

525.84 526.83 A: yeah 

527.03 539.75 A: yeah and my older kids you know they the two the two boys they really never at kindergarten they never were calling people or going over to people's house and stuff they weren't doing that type of thing but 

535.19 536.40 B: mhm 

539.65 545.53 A: i don't know it it's kind of weird how how generations and years go by how things change you know 

545.47 546.57 B: that's true 

545.60 549.31 A: and she's she i don't know she seems to have made 

549.53 552.98 A: um friends a little easier but 

552.68 560.86 B: do you do you notice that the girls have more friends than the boys may i mean i don't know if you can generalize girls versus boys any anyway but 

560.37 562.13 A: yeah um my 

562.51 567.37 A: like i said my oldest one he he is pretty much 

567.67 568.55 A: (( the )) 

568.43 579.19 A: the ruler of [laughter] friends i mean [laughter] he has got a lot of friends he's got a few and i mean it's so funny 'cause we could go to a park and 

569.94 571.33 B: [laughter] 

579.02 585.41 A: um he he could make a friend just automatically just he'll walk up to somebody and start talking 

585.18 586.00 B: (( oh my )) 

585.55 590.33 A: but like the other kids they're kinda more laid-back kind of shy type kids 

589.57 590.86 B: uh-huh 

590.62 599.95 A: they don't they're kinda of nervous to go you know say anything so it's really weird how how their personalities are and i think that has a lot to do with friends too personalit-
