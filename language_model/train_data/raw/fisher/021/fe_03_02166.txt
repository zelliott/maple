22.67 27.85 B: mhm that's that was my first thought i don't have to do anything except just sit there and enjoy it 

27.51 28.51 A: right 

28.04 36.04 B: and it depends on which restaurant of course if it's my favorite restaurant then or one of my favorite restaurants then i'm a happy person [laughter]

53.58 66.61 B: or grab a lunch bite out a few times a week or in the evenings i'm more the type that i go out to eat once maybe twice a week and it's a place that i like and think about i don't do the fast food stuff 

66.31 67.19 A: (( no )) 

66.78 81.23 B: and i think oh most people i know most of my friends do and so it's no big deal they'll get the coffee and the muffin on the way to work and then the sandwich at lunchtime and all that [sigh] and i always bring my lunch because i l- 

80.24 81.65 A: i always did that too 

81.30 92.30 B: yeah are you like that i love food and if i go into places i'm going to indulge so i t- i treat eating out like like a treat that's just what it is and when i go out i don't want to be watching i 

82.61 83.40 A: yeah 

88.23 89.04 A: mhm 

92.22 106.41 B: it- it's like how much extra money do i have to spend i have so much money and i have so many calories and so i don't look to go out just to have a piece of pizza you know the hamburger or something i want to go and have something that i really like and that 

105.40 107.58 A: yes that you sound just like me 

107.18 114.67 B: oh really and that's that's what i do and that's my husband too you know we're just not the grab a bite kind of people 

108.01 108.89 A: [laughter] 

114.87 117.40 A: well once in a while you have to have a pizza though 

117.29 122.51 B: oh yeah yeah i mean we definitely do once in a while but i you know some of our friends 

118.12 119.41 A: [laughter] 

120.28 121.06 A: (( yes )) 

122.55 127.80 B: joke and uh they don't even joke they just say well you guys can afford all those restaurants we can't afford that 

127.73 139.40 B: but more than one time we've sat down and talked about what we all spend and what they spend in a week is definitely what what we spend in restaurants except we just spend it in maybe one place 

132.20 133.04 A: mhm 

138.98 139.75 A: yeah 

139.51 153.09 B: and and they spend it oh i don't feel like cooking i'm going to get the burrito or the pizza or the yeah oh yeah i love the pizzas and the hamburgers but yeah just don't do it very often rather go on the friday or saturday night and have a nice meal and um 

153.69 166.38 B: [lipsmack] but then delis are great you know and not everything has to be real expensive i love delis especially if the weather's nice stop in the deli and get some yummy yummy um picnic food but y-

157.58 158.38 A: right 

165.66 168.04 A: i like to go to subway once in a while

173.29 174.35 A: mhm 

175.92 187.53 B: that's that's music to people's ears oh i can lose weight and eat subway food [sigh] but you know that i really like their stuff because they do the olive oil and vinegar on the bread instead of dairy and that's a great flavor 

184.09 184.93 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

185.67 186.41 A: yeah 

187.16 187.91 A: yeah 

187.58 189.36 B: yeah that's how i cook at home 

189.47 193.82 A: i i don't know if we're supposed to talk about this but can we make more than a one call in a day 

194.49 197.70 B: oh um no i don't think so 

197.37 198.12 A: (( oh oh )) 

197.77 198.53 B: no 

198.57 204.27 B: no we need to talk about the food otherwise they're gonna come back in and and ding us so [laughter] 

200.22 201.08 A: (( yeah )) 

201.76 202.44 A: oh 

202.93 210.40 A: [laughter] okay um but no i well i lost quite a bit of weight about a year ago and i really just try to keep it off 

208.06 209.09 B: you did 

209.91 211.94 B: how how much did you lose 

211.69 214.22 A: um probably about thirty pounds 

214.06 218.46 B: you know what about fifteen years ago i dropped forty five 

218.16 219.27 A: wow 

218.78 221.09 B: yeah a lot a lot 

220.15 227.70 A: and now i have a a daughter who's getting married in about two weeks so i i really need to watch my ps and qs and watch what i'm eating mm 

226.82 232.39 B: you know it's um it's just one of those things that it gets a lot easier home cooking for me 

233.19 239.68 B: is is is safe and that's the reason that i i don't but i do bring lunch to work and that i don't 

239.54 252.96 B: that i don't stop and grab something in the morning on my way to work [sigh] because i i do better when it's not in my face when i don't see it i i don't have it in the house unless you know certain things i don't put in the house [sigh] unless i've got company coming 

247.76 248.53 A: mhm 

253.13 265.02 B: and i i can just control myself better [sigh] i dropped forty five pounds and [sigh] as each year goes on it gets easier to keep it off in that first year i yo-yoed with about ten or twelve pounds and now 

264.79 269.65 B: at this point fifteen years later [sigh] i probably yo yo with at the most five pounds 

269.22 270.35 A: (( yep me too )) 

269.98 273.69 B: and that's and that's about about it and um 

273.40 278.09 A: what do you do you have uh when do you like to cook at home when when you do cook do you enjoy do 

277.14 284.47 B: i love i love to cook and my friends think i'm i'm a good cook my husband thinks i'm a good cook i th- i like my cooking 

283.02 285.74 A: you try to cook healthy or do you mhm mhm 

284.79 295.55 B: i do you know what you know what you know what healthy is to me healthy to me is low dairy i i'm not i don't stress the fat i do the olive oil i use olive oil i use vinegars 

295.69 310.15 B: i what i really watch are sugar if i have a ch- you know a lot of the stuff you see in stores today where it says sugar free [sigh] i could care less i'm er rather fat free usually when it's fat free it's loaded with sugar and your body converts sugar into fat anyway 

309.48 310.83 A: (( mhm right )) 

310.36 321.50 B: so i would choose the sugar free over the fat free like ice creams in stores [sigh] when it says fat free but then it's loaded with sugar and then you've got the sugar free but it's low fat [sigh] i would always pick the sugar free al- always 

320.53 321.30 A: yeah 

321.29 330.81 B: so what i watch at home definitely is dairy 'cause i love it i just don't allow myself to have it very often [sigh] i watch dairy and i watch carbs i 

325.72 326.53 A: mhm 

329.91 332.07 A: and salt i watch salt 

330.71 341.76 B: absolutely yeah just keep away from them you know i know people who eat sandwiches everyday i don't even eat one slice of bread every day bread is not in my daily diet just isn't 

332.18 332.85 A: (( um )) 

340.96 344.19 A: oh i am a carb freak i love bread 

342.93 355.26 B: [sigh] you know i i am too i am too but i just tell myself and after all these years i'm better at it i just tell myself well you can't have everything you like it doesn't mean you can't ever have it just means you can't have it today 

344.50 345.21 A: (( [cough] )) 

349.30 350.07 A: yeah 

354.87 362.86 A: now i'm having something tonight that i don't know but i've heard a lot of people that don't live in iowa have never eaten and that is a turkey and dressing sandwich

507.57 508.68 A: mhm 

508.00 517.17 B: because it it definitely made a difference i remember when i started losing the weight that i had and it was coming off and then um 

517.41 518.83 B: i ended up 

518.85 528.81 B: doing a whole bunch of exercise and it came off twice as fast not that it was coming off too fast but it really i- instead of one pound every two weeks it'd be like a pound and a half a week 

523.99 524.74 A: (( mhm mm )) 

528.79 540.73 B: and it was it was all because of the exercise and you know now that i've i've gotten older and i i read it all the time and i've i'm sure it's true you know the more active you are in getting that heart rate up you know to where you're panting 

539.80 548.05 A: but see you don't live in iowa when you live in iowa you can exercise and not sweat when it's zero degrees outside [laughter] 

546.23 558.37 B: oh well that's if you're outside see i'm in a gym i'm in a gym and when you're pounding away on a treadmill it doesn't matter what the temperature is i could be like outside you're going to sweat eventually you're just going to sweat you get your heart rate up there and and 

549.05 550.44 A: yeah yeah 

557.31 559.11 A: well i live i mean i
