7.20 9.24 B: [laughter] i'm doing pretty good 

9.62 15.88 B: i'm doing pretty good a little strange doing a talk on the phone but pretty good [noise] 

12.32 13.05 A: uh-huh 

15.25 16.27 A: (( i'd say )) 

17.18 20.01 A: would you take a million dollars to leave the u._s. 

20.62 24.67 B: would i take a million dollars to leave the u._s. uh 

25.11 30.59 B: you know i don't know i on one level i would say no because it's 

30.97 35.29 B: i have traveled outside the u._s. a little bit and lived outside for a couple of years 

35.55 39.03 B: and uh i certainly wouldn't have wanted to live there in fact there's 

39.05 41.48 B: very few places i would want to live 

41.56 43.25 B: outside the u._s. 

43.69 46.25 B: so if uh even for a million dollars 

46.71 47.59 A: right 

46.84 47.93 B: um 

48.47 52.66 B: but the the the reasoning for it 

52.70 54.42 B: um [lipsmack] 

55.22 64.67 B: i don't know uh why why would i i guess the question is there's a time and place and what was going on and i could resettle anywhere 

64.80 65.97 B: (( uh )) 

66.10 73.58 B: would i wanna do that um you know even as we're talking and i'm i'm thinking i was thinking well i really like vancouver canada 

73.67 75.52 B: the island of vancouver 

75.54 80.63 B: it's a beautiful place but then i realize as part of the uh question is is and never return 

82.23 83.12 A: right 

82.46 85.11 B: that makes it really really difficult 

84.72 85.59 A: right 

86.77 87.83 B: how 'bout you 

88.44 90.93 A: for one million dollars i would never do that 

91.27 92.80 B: you would never do that 

91.93 95.26 A: the the stakes would have to be so much higher 

95.77 99.74 A: you know to have to uproot my family and myself 

96.21 96.90 B: (( really )) 

98.93 100.78 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

99.78 102.48 A: or be without my family there's no way 

102.69 104.07 B: (( mhm )) 

103.56 109.78 A: you know there's so many things that i think that especially um especially just going through the war with iraq 

109.95 113.58 A: there are things that especially as a woman that i 

113.61 124.46 A: it was brought so close to my attention that i take for granted on a daily basis i'm given the freedom of speech and in how many other countries would i get that due to gender 

125.02 125.99 B: (( mhm )) 

125.24 129.56 A: you know i have two girls i raise you know two girls and 

129.73 137.59 A: they wouldn't have that and all the things that that i pretty much you know just do on a daily basis because i can 

137.94 139.85 A: could easily be taken from me 

140.36 141.73 B: how old are your girls 

140.41 141.46 A: and so 

141.96 143.34 A: twelve and thirteen 

145.03 146.93 A: you know and as anything 

147.11 150.67 A: right now it's so important they're able to get a good education 

150.76 151.66 B: uh-huh 

151.21 162.92 A: they have so many opportunities available for them you know they have the they have the ability to go so far and in so many countries you know women aren't afforded that option 

158.47 159.29 B: uh-huh 

163.99 165.12 B: i i 

164.06 165.65 A: (( now if i )) 

165.84 166.64 A: (( go on )) 

166.75 169.06 B: oh i was gonna say um 

170.00 176.63 B: um in my experience there's there is there is very very few countries that that would that they would be afforded that option 

176.62 177.81 A: exactly 

177.94 187.33 A: you know now if they offered me twenty or twenty million dollars yeah i could probably do it because i could live comfortably it wouldn't necessarily matter as to what my children had to worry about 

187.23 193.92 A: and my family who still is in the u._s. i could afford to come and see me but for one million dollars no chance 

194.12 195.03 B: uh-huh 

195.02 196.02 A: no chance 

196.34 197.30 A: you know 

198.42 199.39 A: i mean 

198.75 199.63 B: (( yeah )) 

199.80 201.33 B: and it it 

200.22 201.02 A: and it 

204.28 205.62 B: go ahead 

205.40 208.80 A: um and any place that i would want to live 

209.71 214.90 A: there isn't much of a reas- there isn't any place that i can think of off the top of my head 

214.95 216.77 A: to visit great 

217.28 222.27 A: i've traveled you know but there's no place that i know of that i would want to go live 

222.42 223.30 B: (( uh-huh )) 

223.31 225.02 A: (( you know i'm very )) 

225.23 227.96 A: i don't even want to use the word content with 

228.05 231.72 A: where i'm at right now i'm more than content i'm overjoyed 

231.85 232.72 B: uh-huh 

232.13 234.92 A: i have so many opportunities and 

235.17 238.19 A: you know for that i have to be grateful 

239.85 241.00 B: (( [lipsmack] well that's )) 

240.01 251.03 A: and i think a lot of its been brought into perspective because of just you know having the war with iraq and you know having people close to me serving in it just genuinely realizing 

252.31 253.40 A: what 

253.90 255.68 A: what my options are 

256.66 265.21 B: you know and that's that's one of the things that that does make a big difference here that is that um the options are s- are 

265.64 279.43 B: regardless of gender regardless of race regardless of all all the things that everybody says there's people who have made it un- under um fantastic odds they've still made it they've still became the top of their field 

279.58 284.11 B: they've still progressed they may become millionaires they became happy they became 

284.63 290.01 B: other than housewives mothers fathers [sigh] and all the things that they couldn't do other places 

289.98 291.21 A: (( [noise] exactly )) 

292.01 293.05 B: (( so )) 

292.39 293.71 A: exactly 

294.38 296.15 A: you know i mean i think that 

294.82 295.60 B: i 

296.54 303.28 A: just you know i and i you know and i'm sitting here doing the call trying to think of reasons why i want to leave 

303.48 304.53 B: (( mhm )) 

303.63 305.96 A: i i can't think of one 

306.68 310.56 A: do i get disgruntled at times the choices that our country makes 

310.84 314.98 A: yeah but is it enough to make me want to leave 

315.60 316.71 A: no 

316.90 317.80 A: not at a chance 

318.52 321.01 B: well you know it's it's [sigh] 

321.14 333.20 B: i think you really hit it on the head i i think there are a lot of different scenarios where you could probably come up with some outrageously fantastic reason why why you would leave um 

333.15 337.59 B: you know if if the only place you could go was 

337.62 349.42 B: uh you know the only as an example if one of your children was sick and the only the only place that would could could heal them was uh say switzerland and you had to go there 

350.29 356.76 B: and you know with a million dollars it took you a million dollars to do that would you do that probably because it's your child 

355.14 356.52 A: absolutely 

356.92 358.20 A: exactly 

358.13 367.67 B: you know so you could come up with all kinds of fantastic but as you pointed out we have so much to be thankful for and we have so many blessings that have been given to us 

367.96 371.04 B: (( uh my children and they go from home )) 

368.11 369.45 A: (( well exactly )) 

371.97 380.27 B: so it's it's a little bit different in that respect because they are going back would i give up the right to see them no 

381.17 382.52 A: exactly 

382.90 386.87 A: exactly i mean i think that there's so many reasons if i was single 

387.11 394.47 A: and carefree and i could take the money and you know make my life what it what i wanted it to be i think it would be different 

393.23 393.90 B: (( uh-huh )) 

394.50 406.66 A: but being faced with the challenges that i'm faced with having kids and you know a husband and you know family that i genuinely care about and just individuals as a whole that i want in my life on a daily basis 

407.09 408.13 B: (( mhm )) 

407.51 408.15 A: (( mm )) 

408.24 410.75 A: not for a million dollars 

408.61 409.59 B: oh 

411.14 418.39 B: could you uh and in fact i lived quite a way from them for a long time 

418.55 423.02 B: and uh we just moved to adjoining areas where we're close to them and uh i hope to 

423.12 428.01 B: uh see them more on a weekly basis if if we want to and if they want to 

426.94 427.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

428.33 436.86 B: and uh you know it's it's meant so much to them at this point in time i couldn't couldn't see that being taken away from them 

436.86 438.10 A: exactly 

438.48 444.91 B: couldn't see it being taken away from myself i mean in that respect i'm selfish [laughter] i want i want things to be good 

445.91 447.02 A: (( definitely )) 

447.28 454.02 A: (( i mean i think that that i think that that right there you just hit exactly what i feel i feel very selfish )) 

454.03 457.82 A: towards the rights i have living in [mn] 

458.65 461.49 A: you know i think that we can always pick out a flaw 

461.84 474.29 A: with our country or our state the government you know the bureaucracy there's always gonna be a flaw with something in your life you've gonna always pick that out but when you start to outweigh you know 

471.47 472.32 B: sure 

474.51 476.83 A: the flaws with you know 

476.93 477.68 A: the 

477.92 478.56 A: (( just )) 

478.59 480.90 A: all of the options we have 

480.57 481.38 B: uh-huh 

481.25 483.67 A: our flaws really aren't that bad 

483.28 485.26 B: you ever you uh 

485.82 488.39 B: you ever hear of a guy named maxwell malts 

489.28 490.19 A: no 

490.26 493.98 B: he wrote a book a long time ago it was called synethics 

494.11 497.98 B: and the reason he wrote it was because he um 

498.31 500.37 B: [cough] was a plastic surgeon 

501.10 506.16 B: and one of the things that he found was that no matter how many surgeries he did on men or women 

506.90 517.13 B: that almost invariably is that his life uh you know a nose job or doing something on the eye or something like that that no matter how how he did it 

517.56 521.68 B: if they weren't if they didn't feel good about themselves 

521.72 524.17 B: then then there was something with the job 

524.76 525.66 A: (( [noise] right )) 

525.63 531.92 B: he could technically peek he he could look at it technically and say that's a great nose i did a great job 

532.15 533.79 B: he'd have pictures of it 

533.86 538.13 B: and people could look at that and say it's a great job that looks great that looks perfect 

537.42 538.43 A: [noise] 

538.55 541.58 B: but if the person didn't feel good about themselves 

541.95 554.24 B: then they would find they they would look at it and say oh that's a horrible job that's horrible i don't like my nose it's i come here to get my j- my nose worked on and you didn't do a very good job of it 

554.41 555.82 B: even though it was perfect 

554.69 555.63 A: right 

556.49 562.35 B: and i i think that that applies to a lot of other things i really and to me and so what you're saying there is if 

562.91 568.36 B: if you if you [sigh] we we need to be able to complain because that's how we get better 

568.54 569.63 A: exactly 

568.66 578.15 B: but if we don't like it and we don't like ourselves then it becomes the that becomes the issue rather than what's what what we can do about changing it 

580.71 583.98 B: uh i think that that change is an important part of this 

584.67 586.24 A: (( [mn] )) 

587.32 588.94 A: you know and i think that 

589.06 593.79 A: i think tune it like a session looking at you know having a twelve and a thirteen year old 

594.03 599.95 A: you know my husband and i strive daily to get them to have you know a self confidence level that's on par
