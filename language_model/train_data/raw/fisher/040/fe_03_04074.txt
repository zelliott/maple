12.91 14.44 A: would you like to start 

14.28 22.14 B: sure um i think that if i was gonna o- [mn] start my own business i would start my own publishing company independent publishing company 

21.29 22.84 A: oh i see 

22.44 25.01 B: yeah produce independent publications 

24.82 32.40 A: [lipsmack] well i would probably um start a daycare business because i have a eight month old son so 

32.30 33.59 B: (( oh that's nice )) 

33.12 35.40 A: that would probably be what i would start 

35.11 35.87 B: hmm 

36.77 39.30 A: how do you think you would go about starting it [lipsmack] 

38.52 43.33 B: um well right now i'm in college studying english and journalism so i guess that 

43.61 56.15 B: i don't know through internships connections made over ah internships and various publications i'm involved with now i would try to get um support and involvement and possibly some some money that way to build a 

56.34 61.05 B: get something started um i'd get a group of people together who are interested 

61.17 63.70 B: and i guess just go from there 

64.39 65.62 A: (( i see )) 

66.12 77.10 A: well i would probably start mine by i guess um [lipsmack] advertising because i know there's lots of right now i'm a stay at home mom i know there's lots of um 

72.07 72.88 B: (( mhm mm )) 

77.17 83.36 A: women that need daycare which i was looking into and i couldn't find that's why i'm still at home so 

82.87 83.67 B: (( mhm )) 

84.07 90.06 A: um i'd probably advertise like at church and the y._m._c._a. and different things like that 

90.97 92.00 A: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

93.37 101.58 B: yeah i guess i'd have to get a lot of advertise advertisers involved first um to collect revenue you know and then their ads would run in our publications 

101.30 102.94 A: mhm 

102.23 103.20 B: um 

104.19 109.72 B: um i don't know i guess basically i don't i would probably try to keep it um local 

109.56 110.95 A: mhm 

109.73 113.92 B: and that way i could get a lot of community involvement and community support for it um 

113.80 114.67 A: right 

115.70 116.32 A: (( um hm )) 

118.75 121.32 A: [lipsmack] what else were we supposed to talk about 

120.23 122.39 B: (( i know [laughter] i'm trying to remember )) 

122.56 123.74 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

125.73 128.73 B: no i guess would you start it in your hometown or 

128.52 134.05 A: um [lipsmack] yeah probably i live in like a smaller town um 

134.62 138.20 A: we live in between like two large cities so 

138.51 146.82 A: we're kind of a suburb of two large cities so i would probably start small and see how business went and go from there 

142.00 142.80 B: yeah 

146.50 147.17 B: (( mm )) 

147.37 150.88 B: i'm not sure where i would start mine because right now i'm going to school in um 

150.99 159.78 B: in kind of a ah it's not really suburban and not really rural rural it's kind of small town in upstate new york but i don't know if that's where i would choose to actually um 

160.45 161.77 B: start a production 

161.91 162.87 A: (( mhm i see )) 

164.38 165.25 B: um 

164.51 166.77 A: so would you start it out of your home or 

166.55 169.97 B: um i would probably see if i could get some people together to 

170.16 173.78 B: rent a space with them like an office space that we could do it from 

173.49 174.39 A: mhm 

174.13 178.04 B: you know i don't know bring in our home computers and i guess work on it that way 

177.83 178.75 A: right 

178.67 182.33 B: because i don't know i don't think i would personally wanna work out of my home 

182.26 186.91 A: yeah i had thought about it and i just don't think my home's big enough to do that 

186.26 187.28 B: yeah 

187.58 191.69 B: yeah i don't really have a home [laughter] just yet because i'm just a college student so 

190.49 191.29 A: (( [laughter] )) 

191.34 192.34 A: (( [noise] right )) 

192.33 194.90 B: it it would kinda be necessary to um 

194.99 196.82 B: rent some space i guess 

196.66 197.59 A: mhm 

197.91 201.65 B: and i don't know this small area there's already a couple of independent 

201.68 206.81 B: publication and uh publishing houses so i think that it would be better to try somewhere else 

206.75 207.65 A: i see 

207.68 212.90 A: i don't even i'm not sure what a publishing like what you're talking about would you just like 

212.76 217.88 B: um like independent magazines and newsletters newspapers things like that yeah 

213.25 214.26 A: get 

215.41 217.04 A: oh okay i see 

217.58 218.61 A: (( i see )) 

219.30 219.96 A: (( hm um )) 

219.59 225.21 B: provide an alternative press to you know op- alternative options to 

225.27 237.23 B: the ones that are out there um like for instance right near where i live in auburn new york there's this great independent weekly newspaper that tends to be a lot more controversial than the main newspap- daily newspaper 

236.92 238.69 A: right 

237.51 244.87 B: and i really admire for them for that that they can be more community based and more focussed on 

245.31 248.69 B: the alternate alternative issues like abortion and 

248.70 255.12 B: you know politics in a different light than the daily newspaper which has to remain more objective 

250.56 251.90 A: mhm 

255.14 256.16 A: (( i see )) 

256.50 257.21 A: (( hm um )) 

257.71 261.91 A: yeah we have newspapers around here and they're not real objective either 

261.59 263.92 B: yeah well it's yeah it's you 

263.84 275.83 B: know in studying journalism it's it's really hard to and to remain objective but i mean that's one of the biggest things that you're taught in journalism is that when you're writing stories no matter how you feel on it you have to 

275.72 281.59 B: you can put a slight spin on it but for the most part you're supposed to try to remain as as objective as possible 

281.25 282.30 A: (( [noise] mhm i see )) 

282.41 285.72 B: except when you're doing opinion pieces which are then subjective 

285.33 286.21 A: right 

286.43 289.85 A: well i recall we just in november we had a um 

290.21 294.27 A: individual running for um i think it was congress and 

294.50 306.24 A: he owns like all of these different newspapers and so naturally all of the newspapers were printing articles for him and not against him and so that was a big controversy and 

297.96 298.65 B: mm 

300.04 301.68 B: (( [mn] endorsing him yeah )) 

301.86 302.80 B: yeah 

303.19 304.17 B: of course 

304.92 305.71 B: (( [mn] )) 

306.57 308.72 A: (( you know [lipsmack] i don't know )) 

309.78 310.55 A: (( but )) 

311.26 318.14 A: i had thought about the daycare but i just don't think i could handle more than one child at this time [laughter] 

315.56 316.47 B: (( yeah do )) 

316.77 318.82 B: you work out of the home now [mn] 

318.52 325.12 A: i'm no i just i'm a stay at home mother and i had thought about opening a daycare like out of my home 

325.18 330.36 A: but my little eight month old is such a handful i don't think i could do more than one child right now 

329.98 330.92 B: yeah 

331.02 331.92 A: so 

331.77 334.83 B: (( yeah well it sounds like i can't imagine [laughter] but i don't know )) 

333.83 334.68 A: [laughter] 

335.44 338.95 A: he is definitely a handful and he's trying to learn how to crawl so 

338.44 339.36 B: aw 

339.21 344.86 A: at first my husband and i were excited but now we're thinking you know once he crawls he's going to be into everything [laughter] 

343.85 344.88 B: yeah 

345.27 346.07 A: so 

346.40 347.19 B: (( mhm )) 

347.66 349.17 A: i don't know [noise] 

349.24 349.89 B: (( hmm )) 

351.33 356.02 B: no i i mean definitely think there's there's something that there's always a market for which is 

356.39 365.91 B: you'd probably be have a pretty good chances of success whereas you know independent publishing would be something that i would be i'd i'd probably consider not going into it really 

362.88 363.55 A: (( [noise] )) 

365.99 367.03 B: only if 

367.16 372.01 B: i don't know depending if i could get enough backing but it's definitely something that would depend on 

369.50 371.31 A: mhm 

372.36 376.91 B: uh the supply of money and if finances weren't really my main objective 

376.75 381.92 A: yeah well i think it said at the beginning of the call if if money were no issue so 

381.18 384.71 B: (( yeah exactly [laughter] and it would definitely would have to not be yeah )) 

382.96 385.57 A: (( you know just got to dream [laughter] )) 

386.54 391.41 B: (( yeah i mean if i was being more realistic um probably i would say pick something completely different )) 

386.62 387.32 A: (( hm um )) 

388.83 390.01 A: yeah 

391.66 392.34 A: (( hm um )) 

393.98 395.18 A: (( [lipsmack] i see )) 

395.76 397.24 A: so what school are you going to oh 

397.11 401.60 B: (( but mm [mn] um it's a state school in upstate new york not too far from new york city )) 

401.78 402.79 A: (( i see )) 

402.44 405.41 B: yeah it's going well i'll be a junior in the fall 

405.72 406.61 A: (( mhm )) 

406.23 407.46 B: plugging through 

409.04 410.62 A: (( [lipsmack] well )) 

410.73 415.72 A: just stay with it because i struggled through and i made it but [laughter] 

415.54 417.64 B: (( [laughter] mhm oh yeah i like school i like yes )) 

415.87 420.19 A: [noise] it's well worth it i keep telling my sisters that so 

420.25 422.37 B: ((  )) 

422.38 424.06 A: that's good 

422.50 433.46 B: for the most part sometimes it gets a little tedious and i think that i'd rather just get out now and enter the real world but then other times i think about it and i'm like no i'm just gonna in my safe little haven of college 

427.08 428.95 A: [laughter] 

434.04 435.96 A: (( [noise] goodness )) 

436.61 437.33 A: hm 

438.33 439.81 B: you know oh i hear a cat meowing [laughter] 

439.38 441.61 A: huh yeah that's that's one of my kitty cats [noise] so 

442.23 442.96 B: you 

443.70 446.01 B: [mn] yeah i don't know i've thought a lot about um 

446.55 459.16 B: doing independent publications is particularly for teenage girls because i i look at the stuff that's out there like seventeen and cosmopolitan and and just i i just feel that they completely perpetuate stereotypes and and 

449.83 450.43 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

458.92 459.96 A: mhm 

459.47 463.90 B: things that w- really we should not be directing towards teenage girls 

461.43 462.47 A: right 

462.79 465.17 A: yes i would agree completely on that 

465.04 468.84 B: i mean everything is just about sex about body image about 

467.77 469.99 A: mhm yep 

469.30 470.96 B: fitting in and i just 

470.32 473.08 A: weight and everything else 

472.05 474.19 B: exactly and i i really feel like 

474.97 479.24 B: we're really giving them the shorter end of the stick by not providing something else 

479.13 488.65 A: right yeah i i think i just heard the other day about some magazine that was trying to get away from that i can't remember the name of it though 

489.26 500.85 B: i mean like a couple of magazines have tried i know there's to do something else but it's just it's so hard because you're so tied down to the advertisers and you know when you're advertisers are tampax and noxima they 

496.70 497.91 A: right 

500.12 505.16 A: mhm yes and covergirl and maybelline [laughter] 

500.96 501.94 B: (( you know )) 

502.17 503.09 B: (( they're they're )) 

504.16 507.89 B: exactly there's certain kind of context they're they're aiming for 

507.54 508.63 A: right 

508.87 509.61 A: (( mhm )) 

510.24 523.85 A: i've never understood why they can advertise like tampax and stuff on t._v. but you hardly ever see condom commercials and it's like you know we we really should if we're gonna advertise sex we should really advertise preventative sex 

517.16 518.32 B: yeah 

523.06 529.49 B: exactly like they're they're doing it i've seen more and more recently i mean and they're even trying to 

529.52 533.15 B: keep them in that kind of um what's the word i want kinda of like 

533.79 546.66 B: pop culture sort of style you know making them making it seem hip and cool and stuff which is good i guess if they're trying to use that method for something like condoms rather than just cigarettes and tampons [laughter] but 

535.77 537.41 A: (( [laughter] [noise] mhm )) 

538.82 539.79 A: right 

545.99 549.69 A: yeah [laughter] hm 

549.57 550.54 B: nonetheless 

550.52 552.53 A: (( huh well )) 

552.71 553.83 B: what was that 

552.73 553.37 A: [noise] 

553.75 555.60 A: that was my little baby 

555.19 556.86 B: (( oh o- o- oh cute )) 

556.86 560.21 A: i was getting ready to change his diaper when they called so [laughter] 

559.18 560.44 B: [laughter] 

560.72 561.78 B: i'm sorry 

560.75 563.62 A: he's kinda wandering around with me [mn] 

562.97 563.86 B: (( [laughter] )) 

564.22 567.87 B: my stepmother just um had a baby six months ago 

567.58 569.55 A: oh really 

568.21 573.42 B: yeah so it's weird having such a younger sibling he's almost he's nineteen years younger than me yeah good [mn] 

570.63 572.16 A: (( yeah i'm )) 

572.96 574.79 A: (( sure it is [laughter] )) 

574.06 575.34 B: (( yeah it's )) 

575.93 577.13 A: goodness 

578.26 578.96 A: hm 

579.96 581.01 B: unusual 

582.33 585.12 B: yeah actually i wrote a paper for a class 

585.21 589.18 B: a couple of semesters ago about the whole idea of the way um 

590.49 591.64 B: what um 

591.57 592.37 A: (( um [noise] )) 

591.74 599.89 B: pop culture caters to teenage girls and about poor messages that we send them so i it's definitely for me i have a lot of interest in it and i think i could definitely 

596.05 597.23 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm ))
