11.56 13.88 B: oh could you tell me about um 

14.01 16.51 B: you know the business you're planning to open 

16.71 23.67 A: um i don't know i haven't really thought about that but like if i had money enough money i would 

24.06 26.40 A: i don't know open up a 

26.71 29.32 A: a basketball franchise [laughter] 

28.81 31.29 B: really well that's really neat 

31.06 32.46 A: yeah how 'bout you 

32.73 37.69 B: oh well what i would do is um actually i would 

34.17 35.38 A: (( [noise] )) 

37.81 49.85 B: open an education center and tutor university students because that's the profession i went to college um with so uh 

39.81 40.92 A: (( oh okay )) 

46.92 47.85 A: okay 

48.93 51.31 A: for a profit or um 

50.39 52.74 B: pardon me oh yes yes 

52.10 53.65 A: for a profit okay 

53.29 55.30 B: right it would be um 

55.38 57.74 B: you know a private um 

58.36 62.95 B: [lipsmack] one on one sess- session with each student and uh 

63.09 67.57 B: but i would be contracted through like the local university 

67.20 68.25 A: okay 

67.71 71.05 B: uh so that i could help you know students 

71.31 74.61 B: but i'm interested in hearing about the basketball 

74.46 87.87 A: oh yeah uh i don't know i mean it's gonna require a lotta like big capital because uh the salaries of players are pretty high but i was thinking about opening 

88.09 100.24 A: opening one in an overseas country not in the states because it's much and definitely it's if i recruit people from america they are so much better than 

100.64 103.94 A: the players in other countries so i think 

104.32 114.55 B: really you think so now um i know that some of the teams over here um have are you local in the united states or 

106.22 107.47 A: yeah 

113.80 117.23 A: actually i'm not from the states i'm from korea 

116.86 121.02 B: oh really oh that's ter- i've been there before 

117.93 119.23 A: yeah 

120.56 121.64 A: (( oh you have [mn] )) 

121.19 131.41 B: yes and uh not to get off the subject here but uh back to basketball we have uh some players that are from overseas like africa and um [lipsmack] 

121.69 122.62 A: [noise] 

130.59 132.43 A: yeah 

132.17 137.73 B: you know so and then of course when we're dealing with other sports we have uh 

137.82 141.39 B: you know other players from different countries too so 

141.61 144.20 B: uh y- you know but um 

144.27 147.11 B: with our university here 

147.14 156.04 B: uh [lipsmack] we have a lot of good basketball players that have been recruited to uh national league so 

150.64 151.56 A: yeah 

155.87 156.86 A: yeah 

156.29 161.39 B: um you know you're right about the salaries they demand 

159.23 160.13 A: yeah 

161.43 162.53 B: (( you know )) 

162.56 164.01 B: a lot for 

164.42 168.46 B: uh just bouncing a ball [laughter] around a court 

167.49 168.49 A: yeah 

169.06 170.42 B: but um 

170.75 173.95 B: [lipsmack] you know how would you like how would you go about picking 

174.21 177.20 A: uh like i went to a boarding school in the states 

176.83 178.95 B: oh did you really mhm 

177.74 180.11 A: yeah and actually uh 

180.34 188.21 A: the that school has a a fantastic basketball team the players there uh those high school players they 

188.25 192.81 A: go out to like uh division one schools with a full scholarship 

192.55 193.51 B: sure 

193.18 206.76 A: so uh so i have the connection to like recruit people from the states i know the coach and all and i mean he he knows like all the like like college coaches and n._b._a. coaches 

206.93 208.80 A: and i mean 

208.81 211.02 A: the one thing i'm planning was uh 

211.14 212.77 A: getting like top 

212.85 224.33 A: players in korea and send them to the states and probably like a camp or like school and have them play here for a couple of years it's kinda like studying abroad [laughter] 

219.62 220.72 B: (( oh yeah )) 

223.77 225.64 B: oh sure well that would 

224.81 229.88 A: you know it's uh like the athletic version of it but then they go back and 

229.98 232.98 A: and then play against uh 

233.17 234.04 A: (( their )) 

234.41 237.23 A: their korean counterparts [laughter] 

236.77 251.56 B: well maybe we could drum up some business here if they're not good academically you could send them to me i'll tutor them and [laughter] and send them send them back to you especially if they come here on scholarships 

244.12 245.27 A: (( oh yeah )) 

245.68 247.31 A: you can tutor in english 

251.05 252.14 A: yeah 

251.55 252.77 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

252.32 257.67 A: i mean so basically the costs will be i will have to recruit the top people from korea 

257.73 258.90 A: send them to 

258.93 263.21 A: the states i will cover every single cost but then 

263.25 273.86 A: i will make a contract with each player that once they get outta those uh schools in the states they will have to play in my team for at least like five years or something like that 

273.30 274.74 B: oh sure 

273.90 277.44 A: (( so i will really recoup my costs [mn] )) 

277.23 281.44 B: sure well they have basketball teams in the olympics don't they 

281.07 284.64 A: i mean they do but they're not that that good so 

284.15 290.47 B: right because i was gonna say i don't think there's a korean team and that would be great if you could do something 

290.36 291.39 A: yeah 

290.66 294.21 B: you know in that order order and you would be uh 

294.22 304.73 B: you know head coach but like i said what you could do is you know send them to me [laughter] i'll i'll charge a a reasonable uh or a decent fee 

298.05 299.15 A: yeah 

299.61 300.58 A: yeah 

303.86 305.78 A: (( huh yeah )) 

305.20 315.98 B: for them and uh but i think that's pretty interesting that you would wanna do something like that what do you think about me opening up my own private tutoring business 

306.20 307.25 A: yep 

315.38 321.93 A: uh that sounds good i mean i've thought about that too but um that's 

322.52 327.27 A: kinda h- i i mean how would you go about recruiting people recruiting tutors 

326.80 331.47 B: [lipsmack] well actually um what i would do is 

331.48 342.52 B: contact the local universities and colleges in my area and i would tell them that i'm available if students uh you know for a fee 

334.36 335.36 A: yeah 

342.55 344.02 B: if students 

344.20 347.58 B: need one on one help and 

347.49 360.78 B: they're just not getting the help that they need from the university i um i'd like to tutor a lot of foreign students especially in english and a lot of them like they wanna learn like american history 

355.01 355.89 A: uh-huh 

360.29 361.66 A: yeah 

360.96 362.22 B: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

362.54 373.52 B: i would you know tutor them in american history and i like the idea of working one on one with with each student because you get to learn from them as they learn from you 

373.08 374.32 A: yeah 

373.60 378.32 B: so even though i'm getting paid for it i'm you know i'm constantly 

378.36 380.36 B: learn- it's a learning 

380.40 382.93 A: so so you will be the only tutor 

380.40 382.17 B: challenge for me 

383.25 387.89 B: i i assume unless the business takes off if i could uh 

387.52 390.52 A: but then it won't wouldn't it be too small 

390.13 402.54 B: well actually i don't think so because when i've worked for the university in the past i've tutored many uh i've tutored about forty students a day 

402.24 403.18 A: okay 

403.07 405.72 B: and um 

405.14 406.75 A: were you getting paid 

406.75 408.52 B: oh yes yeah 

407.73 408.56 A: oh 

408.59 414.22 B: and the um it's it's very it's a profitable business 

414.60 415.61 A: yeah 

414.90 417.02 B: but when you're working for 

417.04 429.92 B: you know an employer you don't get to charge as much and um i in the past i've tutored even grammar school kids and high school students in science 

421.46 422.43 A: right 

429.58 430.73 A: mhm 

430.16 432.15 B: and uh 

432.16 437.11 B: but i've done that on my own if they if parents went through the school district 

436.47 437.79 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

437.19 439.94 B: what they would have to do is um 

440.06 446.02 B: you know they would have to pay the school district and then i wouldn't get as much of a fee 

445.67 446.70 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

446.10 447.52 B: (( as um [lipsmack] )) 

447.84 449.99 B: you know i like i would like 

450.15 454.61 B: uh and to be fair with the fee that i would like to charge 

454.62 456.05 B: so um 

456.07 460.39 B: i would i'd like to open up a learning center because i think that 

460.65 463.90 B: um it could be very helpful 

463.92 476.52 B: to a lot of students even the even the lower grade students they have a problem in math now in that case if i open up this learning center i will need 

468.60 469.67 A: yeah 

474.33 475.14 A: uh-huh 

476.69 477.77 B: other 

477.93 479.53 B: you know tutors 

479.25 480.24 A: yeah 

479.65 489.28 B: and um so i'll have to like go through their qualifications and see how much education they have and or you know and if they're qualified to 

489.45 492.40 B: uh you know tutor a student in 

492.43 497.97 B: a subject that that student needs tutoring in and uh so 

498.01 500.97 B: i would have to pay them a decent wage 

501.00 501.82 A: right 

501.23 503.36 B: um and then 

503.50 513.26 B: the state where i live you know teachers don't get paid a lot anyway [laughter] so i would i would want to not only make a profit for myself 

513.39 516.07 B: in this business but i would like to 

516.17 517.20 B: um 

517.70 521.74 B: be able to pay a decent wage to 

521.86 530.16 B: uh people that are employed by me in in this profession and there are a lot of you know there are a lot of retired people 

524.24 525.08 A: uh-huh 

530.23 531.88 B: too that um 

531.97 539.79 B: uh have worked for big corporations that are very qualified to tutor and they just want something to do so 

536.41 537.64 A: (( yeah )) 

539.81 540.74 B: um 

539.86 541.01 A: (( yeah )) 

540.86 545.54 B: you know i'd i'd be giving them you know like a fairer wage 

545.40 546.36 A: yeah 

545.77 554.43 B: and uh you know they could they could do that for me so the possibilities are endless when you're talking about opening up a business 

554.27 555.12 A: yeah 

554.56 558.38 B: and um getting involved with 

558.47 564.59 B: the community uh the educational community because uh that's what you're specializing in 

559.87 560.66 A: uh-huh 

564.75 568.95 B: you know that's what you'll want to do so um 

565.48 566.40 A: (( yeah )) 

569.08 574.66 B: it uh will take a lot of planning and of course the financial 

574.73 575.76 B: uh 

575.79 579.67 B: you know you're gonna need money i'm gonna need money for that 

579.16 580.43 A: (( yeah )) 

579.86 594.68 B: because i wanna a comfortable place where students can come and they could feel at ease and relax and um i know myself when i was a student i always felt tense at at different subjects but you know 

587.97 588.81 A: uh-huh 

594.72 599.89 B: when i approached different subjects so i wanna make the student comfortable 

596.47 597.54 A: yeah
