113.56 114.40 B: (( yeah )) 

115.76 118.64 B: well inter- internet service provider is fine 

118.88 119.95 B: um 

120.01 123.82 B: if you're going to offer things that everybody else doesn't have 

123.80 128.55 A: yeah um around here w- we really don't have a whole lot of uh 

128.60 139.57 A: choices as far as like high speed internet um we have a we have a whole bunch of dial up service around but i mean we only have 

130.89 131.79 B: uh-huh 

139.62 142.24 A: a couple high speed 

142.82 144.07 B: d._s._l. 

143.89 145.48 A: well we have 

144.52 146.29 B: everybody's got d._s._l. 

145.85 155.88 A: yeah we have horizon in some places like i don't know i've called about it before to try to get it and they said that it wasn't available when i called but yeah 

154.26 155.25 B: it wasn't 

155.70 157.98 B: uh it depends on the location 

157.60 158.82 A: yeah 

158.60 159.60 B: like 

160.65 172.39 B: uh the internet provider that i have is only in my area but when i tried to find something better or cheaper i can't get because it's out of my area and it's a long distance call for me 

172.29 174.09 A: (( oh yeah )) 

173.19 176.47 B: i mean i live in the country you've gotta pipe in sunshine to me 

178.38 184.40 A: [laughter] yeah well i think that would be a cool thing to do though i think that would be a fun business 

184.82 188.65 A: [lipsmack] but i don't really know i think it'd be a lot of work [sigh] 

188.98 189.80 B: well 

190.36 191.20 B: hey it 

191.56 197.05 B: if something that you do that you like and you enjoy doing then it's not considered work 

196.57 198.43 A: yeah that's true 

199.39 201.38 A: my brother works for uh 

201.69 205.08 A: just as a tax for an internet service provider 

205.33 206.29 A: so 

206.35 209.54 B: which would you rather do work for somebody or work for yourself 

209.87 210.95 A: (( uh huh )) 

209.99 213.31 B: this way you get to make your own hours and do what you want to do 

211.94 217.66 A: right yeah i think i would like that more but 

216.81 221.71 B: that way you're your own boss or somebody else's boss not somebody being your boss 

218.85 220.05 A: right 

221.21 222.32 A: (( yeah huh )) 

222.58 229.27 A: and i think that would definitely be good but i'm not ready for that right now i mean i'm only sixteen so 

229.60 231.54 B: oh you're just a little thing 

230.58 232.32 A: yep 

231.56 234.92 B: [laughter] for those of us who are older than that 

233.97 238.52 A: but yeah well i think that some time in the future it's 

238.70 242.80 A: it's an option but i don't really know yet 

241.96 246.94 B: well it doesn't if you can't start with a dream and you can't write it down what you would like 

247.25 249.36 A: (( [noise] yeah mhm yeah )) 

249.83 253.11 B: or you find something that somebody else d- 

253.79 256.62 B: usually you start with something that you like to do 

257.49 261.09 B: and the- or you find something that's not in your area 

261.25 262.92 A: yeah 

263.63 269.84 B: so you always go with what you're good at m- my grandfather always said you always have a jack of all trades 

266.70 267.91 A: (( i think mhm )) 

270.10 275.67 A: i just i was thinking about starting a company with my friends a little while ago for web design 

276.01 284.45 A: 'cause around here there's there are really not that many places to do that i mean there's a couple s- real small businesses that'll do it 

284.49 288.96 A: and i mean i just think like the prices they charge are just 

289.25 296.27 A: [lipsmack] it's more than they need to but i think that that would be a really fun thing to do 'cause that's what i enjoy doing 

296.43 298.35 A: so like i 

299.08 301.75 A: i could see myself doing that in the future [lipsmack] 

304.89 307.43 A: (( but i don't know yet [sigh] )) 

307.72 311.28 A: so i have a while to decide about that 

314.53 315.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

318.93 320.85 B: [noise] i so i guess that's about it eh 

321.01 325.10 A: [sigh] um i don't how long have we been talking do you know 

324.34 326.24 B: i don't know but we have ten minutes 

326.78 328.26 A: yeah 

327.46 328.67 B: (( [laughter] [lipsmack] )) 

329.04 331.38 A: (( well um hm can )) 

335.36 338.24 A: you think of anything else we should be discussing here 

343.49 346.96 A: you said you had uh one other person with you in your business 

346.36 347.29 B: yes 

348.35 351.58 B: we're we are two homeschool moms that do it 

348.64 349.39 A: then 

351.04 356.17 A: oh and so you're do you don't have like people working under you it's just 

355.38 361.25 B: no it's just her and i we do it together we contract together we split the fee in half 

356.54 357.62 A: (( just yeah that's )) 

361.47 362.66 B: um 

362.93 365.68 B: and we're usually there between 

365.80 369.48 B: two and three hours then we come home and homeschool our children 

369.10 371.21 A: cool hm that's cool 

372.69 374.84 A: so it probably keeps you pretty busy 

372.75 373.56 B: so 

374.99 377.61 B: yeah it does it does 

377.93 380.53 B: considering this house is huge [laughter] [noise] 

379.61 380.84 A: [laughter] 

381.51 387.86 A: yeah [sigh] yeah i would like to have someone be able to just come in here and clean the house for me 

388.18 390.30 B: that's a g- that's a guy thing

403.18 405.12 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

403.30 406.52 B: you gotta learn to do it 'cause sometime you gotta get out on your own too
