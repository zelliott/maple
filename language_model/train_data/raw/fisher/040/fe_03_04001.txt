3.16 4.49 A: yeah hi 

6.62 7.90 A: hi i'm kevin 

7.80 12.57 B: kevin oh nice to talk to you [laughter] nice to talk to you 

8.37 9.51 A: yeah 

10.48 11.32 A: huh 

12.54 16.33 A: okay ah so what do you think about that perjury [mn] 

16.57 17.52 B: um 

17.94 19.37 A: would you do it [mn] 

18.82 20.36 B: you know [mn] 

21.03 23.74 B: i've never had any chance to 

24.07 25.04 B: (( what do you need )) 

26.50 28.08 A: well i think like 

27.24 28.66 B: (( [mn] sorry )) 

28.34 29.51 A: if you 

30.17 36.45 A: there's many situations you can do that in like if you're just like helping out a friend like not in the court 

36.49 39.90 A: i would definitely do that but i don't know if it's a law 

40.30 42.35 B: yeah 

41.31 42.98 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

42.42 50.44 B: yeah i can't say that i would i don't think i mean i'm trying to rack my brain and think of any time that i think it would actually be something i would do 

51.40 56.48 B: you know i don't maybe if it would save somebody's life [laughter] i might 

54.24 60.93 A: yeah yeah but then if it's like murder or something you know why why would you do that 

60.48 68.67 B: yeah i certainly wouldn't do it to cover up for sometime a friend of mine had done if they had like you know killed somebody or something and 

68.28 77.01 A: yeah it's like definitely but it's like if you know they didn't do it would you act- would you and they have like no proof 

77.30 84.86 A: like no proof that they she i don't no proof that she didn't do it or something would you commit perjury then 

84.87 90.22 B: see i don't kn- think i would have to then because i wouldn't know that she did it so i wouldn't need to lie 

90.43 91.76 B: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

91.53 92.82 A: yeah but 

93.16 95.04 A: it's no proof then 

95.07 97.10 B: yeah 

95.13 98.97 A: like nothing really would you make something up or 

98.82 107.06 B: no i think i would just say i don't know anything about it i think that's the best [laughter] way to get around something is to say i don't know [laughter] 

106.68 109.79 A: i guess this is kind of a weird question though [laughter] 

109.01 117.55 B: yeah yeah yeah 'cause i can't say that i can think of a [mn] a situation even a hypothetical situation that 

117.57 120.31 B: i would really feel like i needed to lie for someone 

121.06 124.28 B: that it would actually be something i would think worth doing 

124.32 130.15 A: yeah yeah this is like the clinton situation kind of makes me think of that 

127.63 129.04 B: yeah 

129.58 131.01 B: yeah [laughter] 

131.22 134.06 B: [laughter] yeah 

133.18 139.11 A: so for like family or something maybe give up a job for a family or something like that i don't know [laughter] 

139.02 140.49 B: yeah 

140.57 145.06 B: like i think um y- i i kind of consider myself a pretty giving person 

145.09 148.53 B: but i also consider myself a pretty moral person so if i 

149.40 157.51 B: if the situation or something where i could sacrifice something of my own for a family member i would do that but lie for them i don't think i would 

157.32 158.36 A: (( oh )) 

158.16 162.12 B: like if i could take their place or do something to help them 

162.36 166.58 B: out of a bad situation you know if they needed money or if they needed something 

166.44 167.58 A: yeah 

167.30 168.85 B: i'd do that [mn] 

168.42 174.05 A: yeah yeah but then yeah just like lying to the law it's not a good thing [laughter] 

173.43 178.23 B: right [laughter] then i think you're just asking for trouble for yourself [laughter] 

177.64 178.89 A: (( exactly )) 

178.40 181.99 B: if you get caught you're probably in more trouble than that person was [mn] 

181.62 183.16 A: yeah 

182.60 184.07 B: yeah 

184.69 185.81 A: i would 

184.70 187.82 B: [mn] yeah have you ever had to do like jury duty or anything 

187.88 191.12 A: no i'm pretty not eighteen yet [laughter] 

190.89 199.04 B: oh [laughter] well that's good yeah i got called once but it wasn't for i didn't actually get i 

195.10 196.15 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

199.27 201.91 B: didn't actually get to sit in on any cases 

201.51 205.52 A: oh yeah what's the penalty for perjury anyway like 

202.78 203.58 B: so 

205.64 207.82 B: i don't know that's a good question 

207.55 208.49 A: yeah 

209.30 215.48 A: like what did clinton get is that just for like president impeach- 

209.59 210.45 B: (( i have a )) 

216.13 222.16 B: like i know they know started impeachment proceedings against him but they got dismissed 

221.91 226.86 A: yeah but like what about a regular person [laughter] can't really impeach them yeah 

222.38 223.38 B: so 

226.68 227.69 B: no 

227.84 231.23 B: i think it's fines or depending on 

231.28 233.76 B: the severity of it time in jail 

234.30 236.81 B: i think i've heard that happening before 

238.51 242.11 B: so yeah i i mean i know people get caught doing that [laughter] 

241.29 242.91 A: (( i see that's cool [mn] )) 

242.46 249.21 B: yeah so it wouldn't be wor- i don't know why you'd think it would be worth it i unless there was just no way to prove otherwise 

249.30 251.59 B: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

251.27 252.45 A: (( really [mn] guess )) 

253.90 255.20 B: yeah 

255.42 257.35 B: (( [mn] yeah i don't know [mn] )) 

258.82 265.04 B: i i haven't had any personal experience with that i haven't had any relatives or friends [noise] on trial for anything 

265.02 266.81 A: (( hm yeah me neither [laughter] )) 

266.28 269.90 B: yeah yeah so i just don't have a lot of experience with it 

270.38 273.44 A: i don't i don't really know how the court works actually [mn] 

273.07 274.46 B: really [laughter] 

273.57 274.88 A: yeah [laughter] 

274.59 277.57 B: [laughter] yeah 

276.07 278.05 A: (( so pretty weird )) 

278.27 282.36 A: [mn] so when you get called for jury duty do you actually ah 

278.54 279.61 B: yeah 

280.75 281.62 B: uh-huh 

282.87 286.43 A: go there and answer all their questions and stuff or do they pick 

285.78 293.78 B: yeah they ask you a bunch of questions to see if you are fit for whatever case is up that day because if you've 

293.83 301.11 B: you know if the case was somebody who was killed because of a drunk driver and you've had someone in your family killed by a drunk driver they probably won't 

301.13 302.37 B: let you 

302.46 306.07 B: be on the jury because they would a- think you would be prejudiced 

306.16 307.47 A: (( oh that makes sense )) 

306.97 311.15 B: against the person so like they'll you questions or if you 

311.81 315.37 B: if there was you know something racial that had happened in the 

315.61 322.11 B: court case and you're of the race that might have been persecuted you might be more apt to 

317.46 318.24 A: so 

321.68 322.76 A: (( yeah that makes sense )) 

322.12 326.37 B: you know convict the person so they want to make sure everything is 

325.13 328.30 A: would that would that be considered perjury if you lie 

328.32 329.86 A: (( to get onto that jury )) 

328.39 329.33 B: yeah 

329.61 330.47 B: uh-huh 

330.12 331.28 A: (( yeah mm )) 

330.74 332.55 B: yeah yeah 

331.98 335.07 A: [mn] i thought it was just during the court session 

335.24 336.46 A: you know the 

335.85 346.60 B: well i- it was i don't you couldn't get i'm pretty sure you couldn't get sentenced to anything to the same degree that you would if you were testifying in court and committed perjury but 

346.76 349.68 B: 'cause i mean you can have an influence in the jury 

349.87 350.91 A: yeah 

350.05 354.22 B: so if you lie to get on the jury you could get in some serious trouble 

351.84 352.77 A: yeah 

353.87 357.65 A: yeah that that's what make me scared about like american 

357.90 364.83 A: like law and stuff [laughter] people could just doing like a little lie and they just get get through whatever 

359.69 360.80 B: uh-huh 

364.64 365.91 B: yeah 

365.25 366.83 A: yeah 

367.07 370.72 B: yeah what is your background have you lived in the u._s. your whole life or 

370.74 376.48 A: nah i've lived in china till i was five and then i moved here [laughter] 

373.27 374.11 B: oh 

375.90 376.94 B: oh cool 

376.55 377.66 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

377.67 382.93 B: [mn] h- do you know the laws over there are they similar as far as like perjury or jury duty 

381.73 382.70 A: (( ah )) 

382.75 388.43 A: it's not there's not nah there's nothing like that really it's just like the cops they come and get you 

388.54 389.81 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

389.05 391.61 A: yeah [mn] when i lived there that was like

396.58 397.34 B: huh 

397.35 406.36 A: they really yeah they were really like stringent back then can't couldn't even like say anything if you say anything against the government they'll like lock you up and stuff [laughter] [mn]

417.58 418.58 B: yeah 

420.03 420.78 B: hm 

422.11 423.50 B: that's interesting 

425.28 429.86 B: do they j- just have judges that decide everything then instead of juries
