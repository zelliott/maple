8.49 9.96 B: hi how you doing so 

9.44 11.13 A: [lipsmack] i'm doing fine 

11.33 19.07 A: our topic is supposed to be if we were to collect a million dollars to leave the country and never come back where would we go is that 

17.56 21.28 B: well would would we take it i think that i think the answer would be yes [laughter] 

20.64 21.58 A: mhm 

21.40 24.62 B: um you can pay me that much to leave the country [mn] 

25.09 27.06 B: well why don't you start where where would you go 

27.62 33.21 A: jeez i i'd have to think it'd probably be some place where i'd know i'd be happy for the rest of my life 

33.41 37.22 A: um to give up what we have here in the united states 

36.96 40.57 B: yeah so where would that be got so many places really 

37.48 39.71 A: um um 

40.93 43.27 A: i heard germany is a cool place 

43.28 44.59 A: um 

44.92 48.83 B: i i actually used to live in europe and and i can attest to that it is a cool place [mn] 

48.29 55.95 A: mhm [lipsmack] i saw pictures of it on t._v. so it looks like a pretty nice place like how are the people there the german people [lipsmack] 

55.30 60.52 B: uh y- you find you know nice people and not nice people you know anywhere but 

59.40 61.04 A: pretty much the same thing yeah 

60.46 73.02 B: th- the different the difference really is though is if you live there or if you're a tourist you know and if you know if we had a million bucks and we went and moved there i'm i'm sure we would find you know it's like you're you're a local and then you know you're not an american you know who's visiting 

63.71 64.83 A: mhm 

65.28 66.26 A: mhm 

70.31 71.44 A: mhm 

73.07 75.35 B: i think it's pretty much that way anywhere 

76.76 78.21 A: well i 

78.36 82.41 A: don't know if we'd be better to move to a place like mexico or or um 

83.31 85.46 A: what's the other country um 

86.09 87.58 A: ecuador where you're 

87.82 94.69 A: things don't cost as much like you can get maid service for five dollars a day or you know what i'm saying or 

89.57 90.83 B: well there you go 

93.76 96.54 B: yeah and food and everything else yeah 

95.38 98.50 A: or go to some expensive place like you know 

98.53 107.98 A: germany or someplace in europe and um just try to invest the money and make a good investment so the money will last i mean the hours could go go by fast 

105.23 106.42 B: yeah i mean a million 

107.62 110.49 B: yeah yeah it's a good start though [laughter] 

109.53 111.10 A: mhm 

110.27 123.46 B: like i i would see how long i could last on that i was thinking of costa rica i've not been there ever but the friends of mine who have said it's just like you know any other beach community but it's not nearly as expensive and it's not nearly as crowded i said okay that'll work [mn] 

112.45 113.25 A: (( mm )) 

115.06 116.15 A: mhm 

119.09 120.05 A: mhm 

123.18 124.71 A: yeah 

124.35 127.62 B: and also they have a lot of other stuff interesting in that country too but 

128.24 133.21 B: [lipsmack] yeah i don't know i mean what was the other question what would we miss most what would you miss 

132.57 134.20 A: (( what would we miss most )) 

135.62 137.49 A: (( probably let )) 

141.46 142.72 A: (( me think )) 

142.96 153.17 A: maybe the food would probably be different 'cause i understand i understand like the italian food isn't the same in italy or chinese food's not the same in china so [lipsmack] and we have to 

145.09 146.65 B: yeah yeah i was thinking that yeah 

152.50 156.90 B: yeah we have all the americanized versions of all those yeah that's true 

154.57 162.21 A: yeah so that might take us some adjustment but i think the chinese diet's a good diet though 

161.28 163.99 B: yeah they they seem to live pretty long [laughter] 

163.09 165.18 A: mhm but they have this 

165.57 167.99 A: sars there so i don't know if i'd wanna go there 

166.37 167.05 B: so 

167.79 170.62 B: ah well yeah so we couldn't go to 

171.01 176.87 B: good big chunks of mainland china and also taiwan and then hong kong and one or two other places right 

172.84 174.36 A: mhm 

176.49 177.61 A: mhm 

176.96 180.65 B: and and canada for that matter because they've got a little bit of a scare going up there 

180.25 185.41 A: [lipsmack] i'm thinking australia i like their accent but um it's so hot there in the summer 

185.12 193.23 B: yeah they've all sorts of deadly bugs don't you watch on cable all the time [laughter] i wouldn't mind going there too though because i know they like americans down there 

187.84 189.65 A: mhm 

193.20 196.14 A: yeah i heard they're friendly nice people 

195.58 197.93 B: yeah yeah exactly exactly 

197.22 205.00 A: but um maybe like ireland i like their accent too ireland and it sounds like that'll be a pretty area but 

204.87 207.18 B: yeah yeah or england you know 

205.07 206.02 A: um 

206.35 207.46 A: mhm 

207.98 210.18 A: england 

208.07 208.83 B: yeah 

209.20 222.14 B: there's there's a lot of places but i i was thinking you know for a million dollars you could you could just travel for like you know ten years you know [laughter] five years at least you know and find some place you like basically you know after having checked out every place around 

215.23 216.89 A: [mn] that's true 

219.69 220.68 A: mhm 

221.55 222.85 A: right 

223.47 229.91 A: fly around the different countries and see most most of the united states though we know what it's like here already 

229.59 242.20 B: yeah yeah it's it's i actually for for me it's kind of interesting though because i i lived in europe as a as a child and so i saw most of europe as a child but i didn't see the united states much and so it's like i actually have a lot of traveling to do here 

236.18 237.06 A: mhm 

241.86 242.97 A: mhm 

242.34 245.37 B: which isn't isn't part of our question but [laughter] 

244.56 245.66 A: (( no )) 

245.55 247.79 B: but i'd like i'd like to see this country 

248.50 251.61 A: [lipsmack] wh- what country did we did you consider 

252.10 262.49 B: well i i mean since i've already lived in europe and and my brother in fact lives in in in england now i i probably would go to england first um but i probably would wanna end up like in costa rica [laughter] actually 

258.73 259.84 A: mhm 

261.67 263.25 A: mhm 

262.50 267.02 B: you know i i figure as long as i have a little notebook p._c. and i can you know hook up to the internet 

267.09 272.18 B: you know you're always in contact with you know your family and your friends by email which is yeah that's pretty good 

271.68 272.70 A: mhm 

272.61 274.66 B: you know i'd obviously i'd miss my family 

273.96 275.97 A: send pictures and stuff yeah 

275.14 284.13 B: yeah yeah i mean that's that's it's actually kinda cool because people that travel now get to you know take digital pictures and send them immediately and that's kinda cool 

281.12 282.13 A: (( that's true )) 

283.02 286.69 A: and we can ca- call long distance and it doesn't cost that much like 

286.04 287.46 B: exactly 

286.80 291.22 A: that was it used to be like almost unheard of to call long call another country 

290.96 293.79 B: yeah oh yeah and incredibly expensive 

293.85 299.35 B: yeah now it's now it now you you can't even find expensive connections anywhere i mean they're all cheap 

298.18 299.21 A: mhm 

300.05 302.86 B: when i call my brother right now it's like uh 

300.11 300.83 A: (( mhm )) 

303.92 306.90 B: like six cents a minute [laughter] or something like i 

305.54 306.62 A: mhm 

306.97 310.23 B: mean i've i've never been able to call him for that inexpensively 

310.93 313.75 B: so yes so a million dollars would last a long time so 

313.25 314.27 A: mhm 

315.03 316.93 A: [lipsmack] so you're in l._a. 

316.44 323.85 B: we're i'm in los angeles yeah i i wouldn't miss the congestion in los angeles at all [laughter] it's just you got you i'm sorry 

317.88 319.20 A: (( oh okay )) 

320.76 322.92 A: yeah wh- what part of 

323.37 325.04 A: what part of l._a. are you in 

324.70 327.20 B: uh west los angeles right right near u._c._l._a. 

326.93 328.07 A: (( uh-huh uh )) 

327.96 331.15 B: w- are you where are you in seattle i've been to seattle i love that city 

330.50 334.32 A: i'm in i'm right in the downtown the heart of downtown seattle 

333.94 334.90 B: (( oh okay )) 

334.64 337.49 A: between the space needle and the pikes market 

337.97 340.72 A: [sigh] yeah i'm right on the waterfront there and 

338.25 339.15 B: okay 

339.76 345.13 B: the waterfront yeah that's yeah i've i mean i've i've been there like everyone else that goes there i i like that city 

340.80 341.64 A: mhm 

344.48 346.11 A: when was the last time you were here 

345.83 349.62 B: i i went and visited a friend of mine in portland about a year ago 

349.44 350.52 A: mhm 

349.73 356.39 B: and we we drove up you know for the day to seattle and we even went down to the waterfront and you know the fish market and all those places around there 

353.58 354.77 A: mhm 

355.80 356.79 A: right 

356.35 365.06 B: and it's just seattle has the same temper- has has the same weather as belgium which is where i used to live in europe so i really like it i mean i like the rain you know what i mean 

361.82 362.63 A: mhm 

363.88 374.86 A: yeah i do i like i think it's a mild climate here even our winters are really not so bad compared to other parts of the country i mean we hard- hardly ever see snow up in the mountains that's about it 

374.27 376.30 B: yeah yeah i mean you you just get wet basically 

375.50 380.67 A: so if you wanna get you wanna go skiing or something then that's only like a forty five minute an hour drive 

380.43 381.94 B: oh so convenient 

381.03 383.02 A: to see snow but um 

383.04 386.41 B: but you you've got you've got traffic problems now too though right or is 

385.55 390.39 A: oh yeah i think we're the we're the second second city with traffic problems after l._a. 

389.57 394.32 B: that yeah isn't that crazy i think a lot have californians must've moved up there 

391.45 392.88 A: yeah 

394.06 402.06 A: yeah and then now i'm i just read today in the paper that the universities are so overcrowded they don't have room for students to get into city colleges 

401.73 402.72 B: really 

402.58 405.00 A: mhm they're overcrowded 

404.26 410.75 B: oh jeez that's that's yeah i mean down here they are too i don't know if they're cutting anything but it's it's terrible 

410.12 411.41 A: that could be 

410.98 413.70 B: yeah i mean i i think it's happening everywhere which is 

413.80 416.23 B: real sad to see i mean you need to educate 

416.52 418.24 B: uh your your young people 

417.64 421.32 A: i i well it's more of the influxes people 

421.39 422.82 A: to the areas uh 

423.11 434.06 A: something to do with the baby boom i i don't know understand it people have less kids now than they used to but i i guess more kids are going to college than there used to be or something i don't know what exactly it is 

423.45 424.27 B: (( right )) 

425.90 426.78 B: yeah 

432.90 442.06 B: no yeah i think yeah you're right there are there are just more people basically [laughter] and then they haven't i mean you don't hear about people building new colleges you hear about new prisons all the time but you never hear new colleges 

435.70 436.72 A: mhm 

439.60 441.59 A: mhm mhm 

442.15 445.18 B: so yeah i can understand that there probably are a lot of people 

446.51 451.96 A: [lipsmack] yeah so what what are you uh are you in college or working or 

450.80 456.75 B: i'm i'm out of out of college i'm i'm a consultant i do consulting with a manufacturing company 

454.08 455.13 A: oh 

456.13 457.05 A: mhm 

456.84 462.36 B: um it's it's kinda hit or miss you know 'cause manufacturing is basically dead in this country [laughter] 

461.77 462.87 A: mhm 

462.53 463.85 B: (( so what what do you do )) 

464.06 467.32 A: i'm a student right now i'm uh started started 

467.41 470.03 A: school here at the seattle central community college 

469.64 470.57 B: (( oh okay )) 

470.12 473.37 A: i've been in school for about a month now yeah 

472.72 474.49 B: (( so how much longer do you have )) 

474.83 476.87 A: it's a fifteen month program 

476.62 477.77 B: (( oh good )) 

477.20 481.61 A: and if i make it through um i probably will go for some advanced training 

481.70 482.91 B: mhm 

482.48 485.11 A: because you pretty much just get the basics in 

484.99 489.94 B: yeah uh that sounds sounds pretty quick but i'm sure there's other stuff after that you can learn 

487.17 488.37 A: (( mm )) 

489.58 497.08 A: yeah so it's you know it's a pretty intense course there's a lot of studying involved and i've been out of school for quite a long time so it's 

497.03 501.02 A: getting back into it it's starting to get easier now but still 

500.03 501.54 B: (( it's a though [laughter] )) 

500.90 512.44 A: yeah you know you school to five and and then you come home you dinner and you've got to study and so but luckily it's four days a week so pretty much four days a week i'm just not available i just have to study and 

512.33 518.09 A: do the pop quizzes and tests on fridays and ti tired and 

515.57 516.94 B: well you you have 

516.97 518.97 B: some some time for yourself though 

519.21 525.49 A: yeah i have saturday sunday like now i'm resting i should be really reading my book tonight you know doing some work but 

523.62 524.52 B: [laughter] 

526.72 532.18 A: i i may still do that but i have tomorrow but you know it's always the last minute then something happens 

531.78 541.58 B: always always yeah i was thinking about you know taking some classes too and it's like you know i've been so it's been so long since i've you know done all that and you know i would have to get back on that schedule too you know where you 

532.54 533.84 A: mhm 

541.05 542.28 A: mhm 

541.51 552.40 B: i'm going to study for these couple of hours and i'm going to do this work and but if if you don't do it for a long time it's easy not you know to get out of you know uh a condition [laughter] as i'm sure you sure 

550.24 551.29 A: yeah 

553.09 555.71 A: well luckily i'm not working i don't have children but 

555.25 556.29 B: (( well there you go )) 

555.72 566.89 A: a lot of the women in my class have children little children and they work too i don't know how people do it even just working and going to school without kids would be hard 

566.46 573.23 B: yeah i can't imagine people with kids that do that and the country doesn't make it really easy you know for working mothers to do anything really 

568.69 570.02 A: (( yeah )) 

572.63 582.49 A: yeah i know so unless they have one child the oldest child that kinda takes over cooks the dinner and kind of you know guides the other kids along while she studies i don't know 

582.61 584.60 A: have some kind of a system going 

584.19 591.18 B: yeah they must i i i'm not a parent so i don't know but i'm sure yeah like they they do it much better than i ever would so 

586.93 588.19 A: mhm 

590.45 592.18 A: yeah 

591.26 592.15 B: (( [laughter] so i'm )) 

593.21 599.89 B: trying to think are there any other questions that leave leave the united states with a million dollars what would you miss
