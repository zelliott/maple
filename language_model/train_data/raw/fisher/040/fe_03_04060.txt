0.85 2.76 B: hi this is deirdre 

2.46 6.03 A: deirdre this is david how ya doing 

4.56 6.48 B: i'm great thank you how are you 

6.14 9.39 A: good good i'm not sure [lipsmack] 

7.83 10.21 B: so what's your thought on opening a business 

10.22 22.33 A: what's my problem and would i think about it well i don't know i've you know the stipulation was that money would not be an object so that means that you could open you could open a uh 

12.25 14.33 B: uh what would you do [laughter] 

18.53 21.36 B: right i was pleased to hear that right [laughter] 

22.90 31.35 A: business as big well i guess in any area that you wanted to get in and you wouldn't have to through that mess about going to a bank and applying to 

27.39 28.60 B: i guess 

31.34 40.11 A: for a loan or borrowing from your relatives or anything like that but i think i would choose a business that would really be fun 

31.99 33.69 B: exactly 

34.60 36.15 B: exactly 

39.93 41.34 B: that would really be what 

41.03 43.72 A: fun something that i could have real run at 

43.37 44.33 B: uh-huh 

44.38 56.81 A: so that i could just uh you know just enjoy it and [noise] i would wouldn't mind putting in all of the hours required to get it to get it going what what would you do 

52.93 55.72 B: right exactly exactly 

56.45 63.89 B: well i think i i'm kinda with you that i'd want it to be something real fun um and probably what i would do is open up would be open up a bookstore 

63.82 65.46 A: a bookstore 

64.62 74.40 B: yeah just because i i used to work at a bookstore when i was in college um and uh and it was just real peaceful and you know quiet and calm [laughter] 

73.49 77.22 A: aren't you afraid of the big guys that are taking over the business today 

76.63 82.21 B: well money is no objection so i figure um it'd just be something that i'd be doing for fun 

82.19 86.10 A: that means you have to open a bookstore like borders or barnes and noble then 

85.85 92.56 B: no no i would open up my own private deirdre's bookstore [laughter] i have lots of plans maybe some uh 

86.99 87.76 A: (( no )) 

89.44 91.06 A: oh oh which 

92.58 94.06 A: would you sell uh 

92.75 95.26 B: jazz musicians 

94.35 96.47 A: would you sell certain kinds of books 

96.34 107.86 B: oh i would probably just sell a wide variety i mean i'd sell fiction and non fiction i'd want to be kinda small and uh you know have a lot of benches and things for people to sit and read um [lipsmack] 

99.99 101.45 A: (( uh-huh )) 

106.28 107.28 A: (( uh-huh )) 

107.83 116.38 B: and that way you know i think that one of the things that that would be stressful would be you know if if i opened up a business that was kinda fast paced you know i'd be worried about it just 

116.31 128.58 B: being giving me a headache to be there all the time i have an aunt and uncle that opened a restaurant um and it was just you know it was so stressful for them it actually kinda led to the devise demise of their their marriage because 

127.72 130.76 A: they had to they probably had to live at the restaurant 

130.30 142.03 B: they had to live at the restaurant they had a hard time trusting employees they they found one woman that they trusted to to run things in their absence and then they found out that she was stealing from them so um 

132.54 135.34 A: (( right )) 

140.47 141.55 A: uh-huh 

142.15 151.78 B: yeah i just i wouldn't want anything that was i don't know i'd i'd want it the type of business where the environment is just so calming that [laughter] you know the problems that you deal with would be uh 

147.15 154.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

152.12 153.38 B: would be 

153.60 155.89 B: you know i don't know something i could handle 

155.88 156.87 A: (( uh-huh )) 

155.96 164.43 B: although uh you know one of the things that they mentioned was whether or not you thought you would be successful at it and my concern is that i hate dealing with paper work um 

160.46 161.61 A: (( uh-huh )) 

163.87 164.98 A: (( uh-huh )) 

164.40 171.92 B: so i don't know how successful i would actually be at at owning a business because i wouldn't want to deal with the accounting end or the um 

168.03 169.83 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

172.16 173.66 B: (( i don't know just )) 

172.21 185.09 A: well you want do you want hear something i took early retirement and i guess for maybe the past uh three or four years i've been thinking about owning a new business i mean opening up a business 

174.20 175.44 B: what's that 

176.58 177.38 B: uh-huh 

182.89 183.85 B: yeah 

184.23 186.48 B: have you really and what type 

185.31 190.97 A: yeah but you know you know what the problem is it's just what you say it's all the damn paper work 

187.10 188.41 B: what's that 

190.00 191.18 B: right 

190.98 205.94 A: sometimes you have to get a a a license and and that and you have to get a permit from the city and you have to do this and you have to do that you have to file [noise] all kinds of reports and jeeze you'd almost spend you would spend half your time doing the damn reports 

199.13 200.10 B: right 

205.20 206.89 B: exactly 

206.34 210.78 A: yeah [noise] so i don't know 

207.01 208.70 B: it's pretty exhausting 

209.33 210.54 B: yeah 

211.08 221.18 B: yeah i also i used to work um [lipsmack] as a computer programmer and i had worked before where uh i could it's it's called uh software contracting 

217.51 220.55 A: (( yeah )) 

221.03 222.01 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah )) 

221.05 228.16 B: um where you know a company will hire you to come in and work and some people that i knew would start their own business just because they could make more money that way 

223.01 244.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

228.00 239.49 B: um and i could've done that but just because of the paper work i never did you know i would just always be hired by somebody else that owns their own company and just not even deal with that i figured you know i'd rather make less money 

239.35 244.94 B: and consider it to be you know that i the difference being something i'm paying someone else to deal with the paper work [laughter] 

244.52 251.39 A: (( yeah )) 

245.27 246.16 B: so 

246.43 248.09 B: that's pretty challenging 

248.44 252.43 B: so do you think that you will open your own business then or you think that 

251.56 264.40 A: well i'll just have to think about it some more so i think about something or decide i want to get into it when i look into what's involved it's more setting up and organizing it just it just sort of turns me off 

259.75 261.53 B: right 

262.17 263.58 B: right 

264.11 268.95 B: well so now if money were no object i guess you could probably pay somebody to deal with all the stuff 

268.29 270.76 A: well see i guess that's what i would do 

270.31 274.45 B: that so what kinda you said you'd want to do something fun what sort of business do you think would be fun 

272.20 279.39 A: i would do something consultant but do you know what i really would do i would open up an office i'd be like a private detective 

279.01 281.95 B: oh that would be neat [laughter] yeah 

280.17 289.94 A: yeah and uh you know come to me with a problem tell me what you want me to investigate and if money were no object and if if expenses were no object hey i could 

285.09 286.06 B: uh-huh 

290.28 292.55 A: feel free to travel or 

292.11 293.23 B: right 

292.89 296.66 A: do whatever i needed to do get you some uh answers 

295.62 300.17 B: right and probably make things interesting for you too everything would always be changing 

296.95 302.95 A: yeah oh yeah no no telling what you would uh end up getting into 

302.51 306.85 B: now do you think you would hire other people as well or would you just be the only investigator 

306.42 314.77 A: well i think i'd probably start out as the you know the sole the primary investigator but i w- i would hire somebody if i needed help 

314.18 315.45 B: yeah 

314.88 325.94 A: probably need it you know after a while put together a little team and of course if i ever needed a real specialist in the area well i'd have to hire 'em and that's what i would do 

318.06 318.96 B: uh-huh 

322.00 323.10 B: right 

323.29 325.18 B: right exactly 

325.54 326.86 B: exactly 

326.75 330.27 A: (( yeah uh-huh uh-huh )) 

327.21 330.10 B: that's a really good idea [laughter] 

330.16 332.56 B: yeah businesses are tough i've actually been 

332.79 341.26 B: uh i i stopped working about a year ago 'cause i had a baby and now i'm staying home with him and i've been trying to look for opportunities that i can make money from home 

341.15 342.29 A: (( uh-huh )) 

341.37 343.59 B: and it seems that there are a lot of of uh 

343.70 357.07 B: mothers that start their own businesses but a lot of it is selling stuff which i don't really want to do 'cause you know basically i'd just be selling it to other moms that probably also [laughter] don't really want to be spending money at the moment you know tupperware or something 

347.25 351.84 A: yeah yeah 

353.01 358.11 A: (( yeah [noise] yeah uh-huh uh-huh )) 

357.89 359.03 B: so uh 

359.21 363.39 B: yeah starting a business is kinda challenging i think [laughter] 

362.71 370.26 A: oh yeah oh yeah and do you know what in the long run it's so much easier to work for somebody else and let them have the headache 

364.47 365.56 B: yeah 

368.25 369.81 B: exactly 

370.28 371.51 B: exactly 

370.30 374.44 A: all you do is get a pay check you know at the end of the week or whatever 

374.90 381.05 A: and uh you can walk away from the job and guess what the owner's still got the problems you know 

378.96 381.29 B: right exactly 

381.33 381.87 A: and i'm 

381.43 382.61 B: exactly 

381.88 389.34 A: thinking about what you said uh at the beginning when you said that some of your people opened up a restaurant you know my uh i 

387.22 388.11 B: uh-huh 

389.34 397.39 A: was talking to a guy once who owned a restaurant and you know what the waiters made more money than the owners 

395.16 396.41 B: [laughter] 

396.58 397.79 B: oh man 

397.53 407.81 A: the owners have to buy the food they have to be responsible for everything the taxes cleaning up the waiters all they do is take the food from the what kitchen 

401.56 402.93 B: right 

403.09 404.17 B: right 

407.75 417.72 A: the table and serve it and they get a tip and at the end of the night they just walk out and go home they don't have to clean up they don't have to worry about inventory shopping or anything 

408.32 410.35 B: right right 

414.09 415.33 B: right 

417.34 418.37 B: right 

418.14 432.41 A: (( and i say jeeze that's you know that's something yeah yeah uh-huh )) 

421.43 431.39 B: yeah exactly it makes you wonder like for the the businesses that are really successful like you know barnes and noble and stuff you know how they got started and made it work 

432.35 435.71 B: whoever barnes and noble are [laughter] 

434.36 447.37 A: yeah yeah not necessarily well you might wanna think about opening up a a a specialty bookstore i'm in uh i'm in philadelphia 

436.10 440.03 B: i guess you just have to be in the right place at the right time and have the right plan 

444.53 445.49 B: right 

446.92 447.79 B: uh-huh 

447.54 453.92 A: and there are a lot of specialty bookstores there's college bookstores there's bookstores that sell nothing but technical books 

449.39 450.22 B: yeah 

453.48 454.30 B: uh-huh 

454.09 457.43 A: i know of a bookstore that sells nothing but medical books 

457.00 457.82 B: uh-huh 

457.78 459.30 A: (( uh )) 

460.52 463.81 A: there's a store that sells nothing but uh religious books 

463.26 464.13 B: uh-huh 

464.46 465.87 A: so you might wanna 

466.48 475.91 A: think about you know getting into a certain area yeah yeah 

467.60 468.33 B: yeah 

469.24 470.90 B: right that's a good idea 

471.54 476.17 B: try and just become the best at whatever that area is yeah that's smart [lipsmack] 

476.67 482.56 B: unfortunately right now i'm living in texas um and it's kind of a college town and um 

481.64 483.26 A: where at in texas 

482.92 484.30 B: college station 

484.29 498.84 A: where is that houston and austin i've been in austin yeah that's the university of texas there right 

485.47 489.94 B: um it's basically in between houston and austin 

491.42 492.45 B: it's about 

494.04 495.15 B: okay 

495.45 496.81 B: i'm about 

497.08 500.22 B: exactly yeah i'm about two hours away from austin 

500.16 502.08 A: okay okay 

501.77 509.18 B: yeah but it's kind of a small town i don't think i would ever open a bookstore here just because i don't i don't know how well it would do 

502.67 503.64 A: uh 

509.43 514.76 B: with uh you know all college students here unless i opened a bookstore that was selling something that 

510.53 512.91 A: [noise] 

513.04 517.75 A: uh-huh where would you open it would you open it in a mall 

514.90 516.59 B: you know textbooks or something 

517.84 522.46 B: no i think i'd want it well no i think i'd want it to be kind of its own building 

521.77 524.48 A: some building 

522.67 523.96 B: um [lipsmack] 

525.04 526.29 B: and uh 

525.56 530.67 A: (( uh-huh )) 

526.73 537.08 B: i don't know maybe what i would do in like i'd i would want it to be books that were expensive enough that i wouldn't need enough customers you know i would just have kind of a small customer base but when somebody bought something it would be 

537.40 540.39 B: it would you know be expensive enough that uh 

538.81 550.61 A: well i guess you'd need to start out with some kind of study to determine what kinds of people are around and what sorts of things they would most likely be 

540.63 542.69 B: that would be sufficient for my sale 

547.15 548.33 B: right 

550.43 557.07 A: (( be reading what subjects yeah )) 

551.55 552.45 B: right 

553.68 554.58 B: right 

555.74 557.44 B: yeah that's a good point 

558.42 562.12 B: yeah maybe like a or maybe a bookstore that's also a coffee shop 

562.63 569.30 B: um so people could come there and study and hopefully buy some books [laughter] 

562.98 568.47 A: (( yeah well )) 

568.65 577.96 A: that's what that's what barnes and noble has done here in philadelphia they have converted all their bookstores to little cafes but they are still bookstores but they all have a cafe 

571.78 573.35 B: (( yeah right )) 

574.31 575.31 B: uh-huh 

577.46 578.34 B: uh-huh 

578.23 580.82 A: or a reading room they all have uh 

581.77 595.29 A: they even have musicians coming in to play some nights they have poetry poetry readings uh-huh 

583.69 584.83 B: oh really 

585.92 586.76 B: oh that 

586.99 587.87 B: right 

588.12 599.78 B: well it seems like that kind of stuff encourages people to stay in there if you have a poetry reading maybe people will go there to hear the the poet and then afterwards they say oh you know i got some time to kill maybe i'll go browse and and they're buying something 

597.83 599.89 A: yeah
