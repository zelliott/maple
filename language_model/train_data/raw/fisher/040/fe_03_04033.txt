1.64 3.46 A: hi i'm diana 

4.30 5.56 A: can you hear me 

4.37 7.15 B: perjury huh [laughter] um 

6.33 7.39 A: [laughter] 

7.86 10.51 B: tough one i guess what i would [sigh] 

11.00 13.66 B: i don't think that i would y- um 

13.68 19.49 B: however if it was my husband i might consider it depending on the circumstances 

19.02 22.03 A: oh my god you guys must be close [laughter] 

21.40 22.66 B: we are 

22.88 25.00 A: [laughter] 

25.23 30.73 A: oh god um i was actually talking about this one time with my boyfriend ah 

29.60 30.82 B: oh really 

30.71 41.81 A: yeah it's really weird um this was actually a couple of weeks ago and we were asking each other if we would lie for a family member and i'm very close to my little brother 

38.10 38.95 B: yeah 

41.86 43.41 A: and i mean 

43.50 46.00 A: i don't know if i could lie i mean 

46.41 52.17 A: i'd want to protect him but if he did it like if if like if he had killed somebody 

52.26 59.10 A: i don't know i would have to tell him go to the police and i you know i don't think i could lie i don't know 

57.74 58.67 B: yeah 

58.76 63.11 B: it's it's a tough one a lot of it ah for me would depend on the circumstances um 

63.26 72.11 A: right but then again you you'd wanna think that you would do everything for your family or or a friend or you know a husband or a boyfriend 

67.70 68.96 B: right 

71.96 73.46 B: yeah 

73.12 78.13 A: so it yeah but i i guess it depends on the situation [laughter] 

76.71 82.73 B: i think a lot of it too would depend on does anybody else know or does anybody else have the potential to know 

82.68 84.69 A: oh yeah 

83.21 86.68 B: or is it truly just the two of us that would know 

86.99 87.91 B: um 

87.13 90.18 A: oh yes yeah that's really 

89.08 92.65 B: you know what's the potential of getting nailed [laughter] oh 

91.84 93.00 A: yeah 

92.75 93.81 B: um 

93.55 98.54 A: like ah and we were also talking about like what if it was a our children 

98.72 99.58 B: yeah 

98.86 107.12 A: you know like i don't have any kids um but you know my little brother he is thirteen years younger than me so i helped to raise him 

106.65 107.53 B: yup 

107.46 117.48 A: um and ah you know it's just if it were my children i'm i'd be the type of mother that i'd be supportive but at the same time i wouldn't lie for my children ah 

116.60 123.69 B: no i wouldn't either because i think you know we you teach children when you're raising them that we don't have children either but um 

122.87 123.86 A: right 

123.99 129.71 B: you know to tell the truth and the truth is important and i think that that would be reinforcing the wrong things 

129.72 132.88 A: yeah yeah i mean you know right 

130.19 131.12 B: (( and um )) 

131.52 137.42 B: you know when they're if they did do something then they they do need to deserve they do deserve the time 

137.49 138.79 A: yeah they they 

137.64 140.02 B: or the pun- you know whatever the punishment is 

138.87 147.63 A: they yeah they should own up to it but it's really tough i mean neither of us have children somebody might be like oh if you had children you'd you'd think differently 

146.23 148.59 B: yeah exactly 

148.11 155.44 A: but i mean you know ah [sigh] i don't know like the like you like i see my brother and he's like my my my kid 

155.66 159.11 A: you know i mean i'm i'm thirty he just turned seventeen yesterday 

159.27 160.27 B: yup 

159.65 168.13 A: and you know i just so it's like i literally saw him g- i helped to raise him i changed his diapers i would you know my mom 

168.14 182.78 A: i was a very hands on sister so he's like my baby people would even think that he was my child when when i was younger 'cause i i developed early and i really don't think that so i try to say to myself okay i'm not a mother but but say you know he were my child 

174.73 175.43 B: yup 

182.66 183.45 B: right 

182.82 192.58 A: and i like you know like i think i would be the type and i and i've seen it on the news mothers do that it's like let's say their kid does something wrong they'll call the police and and you know on their kid 

187.38 188.56 B: yeah 

192.15 193.06 B: yeah 

193.40 196.21 A: and i really think i would be that type of mom 

195.97 204.68 B: i think i would too or take the child with me and you know and u- unfortunately a law they didn't give us anything as far as you know give us an example 

196.25 197.10 A: (( you know )) 

197.38 198.83 A: yeah 

199.11 200.31 A: right 

204.47 208.23 A: (( i know [laughter] [laughter] )) 

205.00 209.74 B: um but 'cause that would've you know that would've really made a difference 

209.48 210.78 A: yeah [laughter] 

209.81 221.69 B: um you know you're in a room with a thousand people and somebody shoots you know your husband shoots someone would you lie well ah no [laughter] kind of pointless in that scenario 

218.52 220.25 A: [laughter] 

221.18 231.75 A: [laughter] like i tell my brother all the time if you ever 'cause okay maybe it has to do with the fact that growing up my mom like wasn't very supportive of him 

231.69 237.21 A: but so i always tell my little brother but she changed with my little brother 'cause you know she had thirteen years 

236.01 237.82 B: they have a habit of doing that 

238.02 244.25 A: right right you know a thirteen year difference i guess she learned on me you know i got a [laughter] i got the front end of everything 

242.01 243.09 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

244.32 252.00 A: so um so i say to my brother all the time well you know if if you ever feel the need to if you ever think you can't turn to mom 

251.79 265.30 A: you can turn to me no matter what it is i will be there to support you i don't care how bad it is i will be there to support you but at the same time i don't think i would lie for him but i will you know i'll be the first one to be there for him 

264.96 266.25 B: yeah 

265.72 270.62 A: you know i mean i'd feel bad for the victim's family like lets say if he were to kill somebody 

270.19 271.56 B: yeah 

271.46 280.21 A: but i'd definitely be there for him i wouldn't agree but [sigh] i don't know it's really hard like you said th- th- that they didn't really give us like a 

279.99 282.41 B: yeah you know if you're if you're out fishing 

282.59 297.17 B: and you know you're just with your husband and he doesn't have a fishing licence and you end up going to court or whatever and you know the guy say's well was he fishing and you know he he didn't have the pole in the water at the time well you know we're the only two that are gonna know 'cause there was no one else there [laughter] 

296.90 299.14 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

297.82 302.77 B: you know i don't really want the fine either it's not like it's just getting for him [laughter] 

302.18 304.79 A: [laughter] 

303.81 306.77 B: you know and no one's dead so [laughter] 

306.66 309.22 A: (( [laughter] the fish is dead )) 

307.49 309.58 B: (( yeah i think in case i would )) 

309.33 311.00 A: [laughter] 

310.25 314.47 B: but if you know he goes out and murders somebody then there is a room full of people 

312.62 313.84 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

314.51 316.48 B: sorry honey you're on your own 

314.67 316.01 A: yeah 

316.80 319.66 A: yeah that's true oh that's so tough 

318.24 320.79 B: you know there's not a lot i can do to help you there 

320.88 322.05 A: yeah 

322.06 327.45 A: but the question is would would he lie for you [laughter] 

325.48 328.38 B: yeah that's a good one i don't know 

328.64 335.61 B: i don't know i think you know i think that i don't agree with lying for someone for perjury and stuff 

329.64 330.63 A: (( yeah )) 

335.35 336.26 A: yeah 

335.77 339.10 B: but i think in some situations it may be 

339.23 340.16 A: yeah 

339.47 341.68 B: more acceptable than in others 

341.63 347.88 A: the thing with me i'm a nervous person to begin with so even if i'm not lying people would probably think i am 

344.77 345.81 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

347.35 348.43 B: uh-huh 

348.64 354.69 A: or or like with me i tell the truth and i laugh so people think i'm lying and i'm not [laughter] 

353.77 355.18 B: exactly 

355.69 356.59 B: yeah 

355.93 360.62 A: so i would probably look like i was perjuring when i really wasn't i would just be nervous 

361.43 362.33 A: you know 

361.94 363.11 B: this is true 

363.09 371.09 A: like i i always i always get nervous like let's say i do have to take a lie detector test for any reason i'd be the first one to fail one even if i'm innocent 

370.74 373.24 B: oh yeah oh definitely 

371.63 382.94 A: [laughter] you know 'cause i'm just such a nervous person even when the phone just rang i was like oh my god is that my mom oh my god it's the test people oh let me just take it stop being silly 

375.39 376.19 B: yeah 

381.58 383.87 B: yeah same here [laughter] 

383.26 389.13 A: [laughter] yeah so i hope i'm not never presented with that situation otherwise oh god 

389.25 394.11 B: yeah i don't think it's a situation anyone ever wants to have to have to do um 

389.25 390.81 A: you know they'd just think i was 

394.79 399.95 B: and i g- and for me it would totally depend on what what the circumstances around it were 

399.91 405.14 A: yeah like if it's i guess if it's something if the difference is whether or not it's something major or minor 

404.80 406.14 B: yeah 

406.03 407.56 A: you know like ah 

407.62 420.72 A: so i guess that would be the difference like my brother's about to go to to off to college in a year less than a year or what ever and you know would i lie to to get him more of a financial aid package 

412.09 413.39 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

421.00 426.19 A: ah i don't know would we go to court i don't know maybe i would 

424.11 429.57 B: yeah you know who's gonna what are the repercussions from it and wh- you know how in depth are they gonna look yup 

429.65 436.94 A: right you know i mean it wouldn't be much of a lie anyway because um our family doesn't really have much money so 

433.83 434.78 B: [laughter] 

436.03 439.32 B: yeah i hear you there college isn't cheap 

437.71 440.95 A: [laughter] yeah so 

439.95 441.98 B: my husband's a student right now 

442.09 443.27 A: oh really 

442.66 447.06 B: yeah so it's like oh one more yeah thank god that's it 

446.52 449.58 A: i never finished i i still have one more year 

449.27 454.37 B: yeah i oh i never finished my degree but he went back at about five years later so 

450.03 450.70 A: i 

454.64 455.88 A: (( how old are you )) 

456.46 458.80 B: thirty i'll be thirty two the end of the month 

459.09 469.00 A: i'm actually going to be thirty in june so but i'm already saying i'm thirty 'cause ah what's a month [laughter] yes i'm you know thank god people think i look younger thank god 

463.73 465.89 B: yeah so 

468.72 470.95 B: yeah i guess i'd say you know if it's 

469.67 470.61 A: [laughter] 

471.58 473.84 B: if it's murder then no i don't think i would 

474.09 476.51 A: yeah ah i i don't i don't think i would 

474.54 478.94 B: but if for for a minor offence for a nonjailable thing 

479.14 480.27 B: then yeah 

479.29 487.18 A: yeah like if yeah if it's something small probably yeah i'd probably lie but if it's something big like murder i mean you would have to 

486.04 488.00 B: murder hm yeah 

487.48 500.40 A: i mean as much as you we love our family members the person that lost their family member they love them too or what if our family member happens to be like a bad seed i i don't think i could lie for a bad seed you know 

493.17 494.07 B: yup 

497.07 497.88 B: yeah 

499.99 500.74 B: no 

500.93 507.03 A: right so so i mean if my brother were to be a bad seed i mean i i can't perjure myself 

506.44 508.87 B: i love you and i'm sorry but you're on your own 

509.08 512.37 A: yeah i'll support you but i'm not gonna lie 

510.92 513.82 B: i'll come and visit you every sunday but [laughter] 

513.48 517.68 A: [laughter] yeah i'll support you but i'm not gonna lie for you 

515.70 517.57 B: send you a christmas card 

517.83 518.91 A: [laughter] 

519.15 520.05 B: (( yeah i don't )) 

519.72 522.86 A: really would you still be there for ah your family member 

523.16 525.27 B: i think so um 

524.54 525.29 A: (( yes )) 

525.62 534.07 B: it would depend on which family member i mean if it was my mother maybe not but but if it was my um father or my nephew 

530.14 531.15 A: (( oh really )) 

534.15 536.16 B: my sister or something yeah i would 

536.14 537.84 A: oh wow 

538.09 539.12 B: yeah 

538.30 543.31 A: yeah i my mom you know wasn't exactly she tried to be a good mother what um 

542.38 544.25 B: my mother tried she just failed 

544.44 550.30 A: [laughter] my mother tried she sucked at it but you know i forgive her um 

550.21 564.37 A: and i feel a strong bond towards her so i guess i'd huh i i guess i would you know because i know she tried she tried with her best with whatever was available to her 'cause my father left her when i when you know when i was born 

557.40 558.40 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

564.05 565.27 B: yeah 

564.85 566.96 A: so yeah so i think 

567.07 576.30 A: since she tried so you know i i'm i'm starting to get over it i forgive her so i think i would i feel like a very strong bond towards her now now that i'm older 

576.18 577.12 B: (( yup [laughter] )) 

576.34 586.15 A: so i think i i think i would lie for her just just just to show her look you know i don't resent you 'cause sometimes she's like ah you you resent me and like oh stop i don't resent you 

586.40 591.49 A: okay [laughter] so i i think that i i i think i would lie for her 

591.86 593.92 A: you know or maybe 

594.07 599.89 A: well again depending on what it was like you said you know if it was something small [noise] i think i would 

596.74 597.70 B: yeah
