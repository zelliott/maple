0.55 1.83 B: hello 

1.40 2.90 A: oh hello 

3.01 7.58 A: hi this is h- this is gill hoover i'm calling from johnstown pennsylvania 

3.17 4.12 B: hi 

7.91 11.19 B: okay this is kimberly from new jersey 

11.34 12.34 A: hi 

12.81 14.59 A: wow what a topic 

15.05 18.58 B: i haven't done this before so do you know what we're supposed to do 

15.15 16.21 A: um 

17.25 28.28 A: okay this is only my second time okay ah i i did this yesterday we're supposed to discuss whether we would commit perjury for a relative or a close friend 

27.93 29.05 B: mhm 

28.99 31.50 A: and that sort of 

31.77 35.84 A: is kind of a weird topic to have to discuss 

35.89 37.03 B: okay 

36.30 37.16 A: huh 

37.56 38.67 A: (( i )) 

39.20 44.40 A: i hope i have good morals i don't know i would say no at this point 

44.87 49.07 A: that i you know i'd i can't conceive myself committing perjury 

49.62 54.10 A: for a friend or a relative but i don't know for sure 

54.69 65.56 B: um i think for me it would have to do deal with the situation um if it was a slight detail that you know we're talking about something 

65.52 75.54 B: that maybe the person's being falsely accused and if i change a slight detail it makes them look more innocent even though i know they didn't do it and they're being you know 

75.99 82.94 B: um accused of something an- and all the circumstantial evidence looks like you know it's against them 

83.51 85.92 B: um and and if it was like 

86.04 93.48 B: um like a time that say you know were you there at one o'clock and they were really there at one fifty two 

93.58 97.09 B: i mean um twelve fifty two or something like that 

97.44 107.17 B: ah maybe i'd be willing to s- change slight details if i think that you know there's like a witch hunt against them because they can't find any other suspect 

107.11 112.20 A: well yeah i think too you could say they were there around one but you weren't looking at a clock 

112.42 116.96 B: right right exactly exactly sort of bend the truth a little bit 

115.27 116.20 A: um 

117.00 118.05 A: (( yeah ah )) 

118.70 126.06 A: going through this thing that's going on now with the the ah junior girls and the senior girls hurting the junior girls 

126.26 138.73 A: you know that something like that shocks the heck out of you and i can perceive their friends lying to hopefully get their friends from being hurt and i think that's wrong 

139.56 152.81 B: yeah now that yeah that i would say definitely um if you know that someone did something and you're lying just to get your friend off that's a different story but i mean if i'm talking about if i know someone's being falsely accused 

139.57 140.72 A: you know what i mean 

152.65 153.90 A: mhm 

152.87 164.31 B: and they need my assistance and it's sort of making a little bit of a white lie to to make it look so they look more innocent and they are innocent 

164.37 166.30 A: mhm 

164.82 176.72 B: ah ah i don't think i um would have a problem doing that because people get stuck in these weird situations where all the arrows are pointing to them and that they're guilty and and sometimes they're not 

176.78 186.09 A: well that's true too i yeah it it would be a hard decision to make i've been a- a- o- o- on a jury and watching what's going on you know 

185.99 194.56 A: um i you know it would i think i think it would have to some real extenuating circumstances before i i would lie for someone 

194.79 196.58 A: but then again somebody else 

195.20 196.61 B: well i'm not but 

197.50 201.18 B: well i'm not talking like [laughter] 

197.68 198.96 A: (( now i i )) 

200.09 209.42 A: something major i understand exactly what you're saying a- a- a- and i tend to agree with you but then i would have i would have guilt trips all over the place myself 

209.20 213.75 B: well like for instance okay suppose my mother and i got into a traffic accident 

213.78 219.67 B: okay and she hurt her neck in the accident and they asked her was she wearing her seat belt 

214.16 215.10 A: uh-huh 

220.13 229.88 B: now if if she says no then maybe they can blame the fact that she has this neck injury because she wasn't wearing her seat belt 

228.40 231.29 A: oh okay okay i 

229.96 231.57 B: and in my mind 

231.97 241.72 B: i'm gonna s- you know if she want's to say yes she was wearing her seat belt then i'll probably say yes she was wearing her seat belt because i think that whether she was wearing it or not and she got hit 

232.80 233.50 A: (( imagine )) 

241.57 252.87 B: behind by a car her neck's gonna hurt regardless but if they have that extra little thing to say well you weren't wearing your seat belt therefore we're not gonna you know pay your medical bills 

252.51 253.24 A: oh 

253.26 261.02 A: oh i agree with you there yeah sometimes i think things are very unfair that way i understand what you're saying exactly about that 

261.59 271.00 A: i'm heading more towards the end of my life and the more i head towards the end of my life the more i look at the end that i have to face myself in the mirror 

271.09 271.80 B: (( mm )) 

271.12 277.23 A: and i agree with i agree exactly with what you're saying i would probably do the same thing 

277.38 280.77 A: although i think i would [laughter] feel guilty about it you know what i mean 

277.41 278.41 B: mhm 

280.70 281.57 B: mhm 

280.82 286.09 A: but if but the yeah i often wondered like if um 

286.86 293.42 A: i i saw a thing on t._v. where someone was really badly hurt and their friend gave them their um 

293.45 298.24 A: medical card because they had no insurance and told her to pretend that she was 

299.05 303.19 A: the person th- that had the medical card so she could get care 

300.21 301.31 B: uh-huh 

301.54 302.57 B: (( i see )) 

303.07 304.08 B: uh-huh 

303.97 305.67 A: i can see lying 

305.71 310.61 A: to help someone like that and i think if i would you know 

311.86 316.34 A: i think there are circumstances where there is such a thing as a good lie 

316.25 317.34 B: mhm 

317.23 320.67 A: you under- i i i i see exactly where you're coming from 

320.87 322.02 B: right 

321.84 323.16 A: you know and 

322.04 324.78 B: and even though you you're under oath 

324.80 326.83 B: um you could just say 

326.84 330.42 B: i don't remember if they were wearing their seat belt or not 

330.52 332.38 B: you know i mean 

331.00 332.89 A: (( well that's true that's true )) 

333.04 335.98 A: yeah yeah it's such a hard 

333.09 333.75 B: (( [sigh] )) 

334.30 335.88 B: i don't think that 

336.55 348.15 B: i don't think that you know when you're when you're in a courtroom and and you're saying you know with your hand on the bible i think it's really the the relationship between you and god and if you think that god would understand 

348.34 353.09 B: then i don't think that that anyone else has a right to say that you know 

353.54 359.23 B: y- your per- you know your your your perjury or whatever it's between me and and him or 

353.87 354.83 A: yeah 

359.22 360.65 A: (( yeah )) 

359.48 360.76 B: and that's that 

361.06 362.05 B: 'cause it 'cause 

361.17 362.55 A: it's really 

362.68 364.01 A: go ahead 

364.03 376.80 B: 'cause i don't even know why they have to have the whole bible i- in the courtroom anyway you know when you put your hand on the bible and you swear to tell the truth i mean if this is supposed to be separation from god and state you know religion and state 

369.52 370.75 A: mhm 

375.20 376.82 A: oh well that's true 

376.57 379.78 B: wh- what you know what is that doing there anyway that 

379.72 381.67 A: mhm yeah 

380.03 382.75 B: you swear on the bible to tell the truth 

383.09 384.65 A: right right 

383.22 386.15 B: that shouldn't be a part of the process you know 

386.46 394.52 A: well i don't know if you have children or not but there are often times that you will do things for your children that you wouldn't do in a normal situation 

395.30 402.48 A: you know that that oh well that makes makes a big difference in what's going on um 

395.91 397.60 B: no i don't have children 

403.17 406.11 A: see if somebody said to me could i kill someone 

406.17 409.39 A: and i said no and then i thought yes 

409.60 416.38 A: if someone if my child was in harms way and the only way to save them was to kill that person i would do it 

416.06 417.10 B: mhm 

416.51 422.52 A: you know i think there's extenuating circumstances to everything and with perjury i think that 

422.59 423.79 A: (( you know that's )) 

423.82 429.56 A: i i do i agree with you i think there are some things that you could just have a faulty memory 

429.62 430.67 B: mhm 

429.84 430.82 A: and 

430.95 432.15 A: you know 

432.48 436.18 A: i think if it wasn't gonna change things ma- majorly 

436.22 446.40 A: then perhaps i would i would do the same thing that i would have a real foggy memory over what happened did you see this did you see that and i'd say well you know i can't really remember 

442.57 443.52 B: mhm 

445.08 458.45 B: yeah and i'd have to think about whether i wanted to do that or not i mean it wouldn't be just because they're my friend or just because they're my relative i'm gonna lie i mean if i feel that there is some sort of situation that calls for that 

446.66 447.46 A: yeah 

454.22 455.59 A: exactly 

458.81 459.87 B: you know 'cause 

459.27 469.93 A: oh i a- yeah i agree totally it's just really hard to know what you would do in a situation you could say what you would do but when it actually came down to it it might be a whole different thing 

469.86 470.84 B: mhm 

471.20 473.63 A: you know it's it's amazing 

472.64 480.74 B: and and you know what the weird part is i'd be it'd be easier for me to lie for someone else than for me to lie about my own actions 

480.80 484.16 B: i would not be able to sit up there and say 

481.43 482.74 A: oh yeah 

482.82 484.48 A: i don't think no 

484.54 488.43 B: i didn't do that when i really did i wouldn't be able to do that 

484.67 486.23 A: (( no i don't think )) 

488.82 491.98 A: b- and that's the same thing with me um 

492.03 500.13 A: if i was stupid enough to do something to end up in that situation i'd deserve what i got [laughter] you understand what i mean i mean so 

496.97 498.08 B: mhm 

498.62 500.68 B: (( yeah no i do i do )) 

500.88 502.46 A: you know i i just 

500.89 502.92 B: 'cause 'cause i wouldn't be able 

503.00 509.28 B: i i wouldn't be able to lie for myself i it'd be easier for me to to kind of help and lie for someone else 

503.32 504.18 A: right 

509.69 515.78 B: 'cause you have to give them the benefit of the doubt and i know what i was thinking when i did it and you know 

509.99 511.65 A: yeah i think so too 

515.07 523.35 A: mhm oh sure oh sure we just had that situation in here in town where two girls got mad at another girl and beat her to death 

523.74 525.14 B: (( oh my god )) 

523.89 527.21 A: and now they're crying crock now they're crying crock 

527.44 528.58 A: over 

528.57 532.79 A: being in jail for the rest of their lives well they chose to do that 

532.52 533.73 B: mhm 

532.73 546.46 A: you know and that's that's their problem and that's their responsibility they killed the girl they deserve what they get you know and i i you know but i yeah i agree perjury is a real 

541.24 542.11 B: right 

547.28 550.67 A: you know hard thing to talk about or to deal with 

550.68 560.12 A: and i guess it i agree with you i think it would totally depend on what the situation was and w- w- if i told a white lie 

561.25 563.29 A: if it would help my friend 

563.81 573.23 A: you know i couldn't totally lie and say like they asked if a person was there and they weren't and they said they were i would have to say they weren't there 

573.32 574.40 B: mhm 

573.61 575.40 A: i couldn't lie about it 

575.20 576.17 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

575.58 576.77 A: you know what i mean 

577.23 580.72 A: and i'd just i think it depends on the degree of 

580.83 583.45 B: of the crime and and the situation 

581.13 582.35 A: culpability 

582.56 583.51 A: right 

584.17 586.51 A: yeah it just really makes a difference 

584.95 599.89 B: and if you know the person you know the person is like you know they volunteer they do volunteer work they give to charities they go to church you know that they're a good person and maybe they made um a wrong judgement and it's not that the judgement hurt anyone i mean it could be some 

599.27 599.89 A: mhm
