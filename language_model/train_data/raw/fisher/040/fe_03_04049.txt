31.33 32.07 A: (( mm )) 

32.42 39.86 B: i could be a consultant i could hire myself out to like engineering companies 

39.97 45.23 B: or natural resource management firms 

45.53 46.56 B: or 

46.62 50.96 B: like a local government city government county government something like that

80.74 82.04 B: oh 

81.39 94.88 A: the two things i've been thinking about i know when i was younger i always like noticed that a lot of the young kids or rather that there's not like a lot of things to do around here so i always thought about opening up something for like 

84.38 85.39 B: uh-huh 

92.08 93.00 B: uh-huh 

95.06 108.11 A: for like the young kids like a little recreation or something like that like an arcade or like a nightclub with like arcade games like go karting and stuff like that but i never knew how to get money so they said money's not an option 

98.05 99.48 B: (( oh )) 

99.76 100.78 B: yeah 

104.15 105.25 B: yeah 

107.90 109.04 B: right 

108.39 121.09 A: yeah i would do that or like i want to do something like advertising like advertising agency or something like that 'cause i know there's a lot of money in that but i really don't know which one i should go into 

114.80 115.89 B: (( oh yeah )) 

116.57 117.73 B: really 

120.78 125.34 B: well [cough] at this point we're just talking right so we can talk about both of 'em even 

124.69 126.03 A: mhm 

125.54 126.62 B: (( why not )) 

126.66 129.05 B: now where are you if i may ask 

128.41 129.99 A: i'm in new jersey 

129.62 133.36 B: new jersey okay see i'm in minnesota 

130.29 132.54 A: uh-huh where are you at 

132.81 133.77 A: (( oh )) 

133.53 135.67 B: yeah it's a small town in minnesota 

135.18 137.61 A: yeah i'm a small town in new jersey 

137.24 138.75 B: really okay 

137.79 139.03 A: yeah 

138.79 142.81 B: see i didn't know there were any small towns in new jersey [laughter] 

140.71 144.02 A: [laughter] in south jersey there is 

143.70 144.92 B: okay 

144.42 146.80 A: but i don't know 

145.58 148.14 B: now are you close to the atlantic 

148.16 149.05 A: huh 

148.73 150.80 B: are you close to the shore the 

150.27 152.25 A: [lipsmack] i'm about 

152.43 154.85 A: an hour or two away i'd say 

154.16 155.86 B: okay yeah 

154.88 156.22 A: not that far 

156.13 157.70 B: mhm 

157.72 162.08 B: now if you were to open say the kinda the nightclub 

161.88 163.64 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

162.87 166.41 B: uh these would be for like teenagers and younger 

166.73 169.27 A: [noise] yeah i would see teenage and younger 

168.80 174.94 B: mhm so then you couldn't serve you know alcohol right but it could still be 

171.38 173.17 A: alcohol no 

175.03 176.92 B: seems like it would still be 

176.95 180.01 B: a good idea you can have soft drinks and whatever 

179.61 180.71 A: uh-huh 

180.36 181.98 B: coffee or whatever 

181.99 184.56 A: the problem is though teens 

185.04 192.98 A: if stuff gets out of control they bring a lot of a lot of problems that's another thing you have to look so i don't know what age 

189.18 190.43 B: yeah 

193.21 194.24 B: yeah 

193.33 201.76 A: what age group i would say 'cause at least with the older crowd i'm sure won't be that much problems but they have a lot of stuff for the older kids and the younger kids need something to do 

197.68 198.53 B: mhm 

201.65 202.60 B: yeah 

201.87 205.14 A: but the first thing i would do instead of opening up a um 

205.39 210.68 A: [lipsmack] a club i would open up the recreation thing go carts and stuff like that do that first 

209.43 212.64 B: [cough] [lipsmack] okay okay would that be indoors 

212.56 216.64 A: yeah indoors with with the go carts be outsides probably 

213.67 214.62 B: okay 

216.38 218.20 B: yeah okay okay 

218.28 222.15 B: (( you could have you know basketball courts half courts something )) 

220.67 221.47 A: (( mm )) 

222.25 227.15 A: uh with that computer business like does that that's good money doing that 

226.58 234.11 B: yeah when i was working um in that field before see i'm in college now i'm in graduate school now 

233.32 234.77 A: mhm 

234.24 238.07 B: because i thought that would help me advance faster 

237.90 238.67 A: (( mm )) 

238.39 240.07 B: and i think it will work out 

240.09 245.87 B: um but my last job i made forty six thousand a year which for me was real good 

245.17 246.44 A: yeah 

246.26 250.94 B: but i think af- with a master's degree an advanced degree i should be able to do even better 

250.67 255.90 A: [lipsmack] yeah and my dad he went to comput- you ever heard of chubb institute 

255.74 256.82 B: chubb 

257.07 258.38 B: no i can't say 

257.42 269.07 A: i think it it might just be out over here and he went there it's supposed to be like a real good school and he went to two computer schools as a matter of fact and he came out [lipsmack] and he got a couple of jobs but they weren't what he wanted so 

260.16 261.09 B: (( mhm )) 

262.86 263.91 B: mhm 

264.80 265.73 B: mhm 

268.43 269.83 B: (( mhm )) 

269.15 272.94 A: h- he he and his teacher opened up a business 

272.77 274.16 B: (( oh )) 

273.07 287.47 A: like they were gonna first they were trying to open up a school but the school really wasn't flying like that so they had like a computer repair shop or and networking and stuff but he's having a hard time with that and i thought it would be easy doing computers 

275.99 276.99 B: yeah 

278.11 279.07 B: uh-huh 

281.16 282.14 B: yeah 

285.93 286.77 B: (( mm )) 

287.20 288.42 B: yeah 

287.36 291.62 A: as before he uh he was a correction officer but he got hurt 

291.12 292.83 B: oh oh man 

291.72 299.87 A: so he he went they sent him to school for computers but it doesn't seem like it's working for him that the way they're expecting 

293.77 294.84 B: okay 

295.30 296.36 B: yeah 

299.27 304.59 B: well [sigh] i mean i think computers are gonna be with us you know from here on 

302.78 305.25 A: yeah that's when mhm mhm 

304.60 309.23 B: so in general it seems like a very good idea to me and [lipsmack] 

306.99 308.62 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

309.36 315.47 B: they're gonna be more and more part of everybody's every day activities 

315.53 328.99 B: you know foundation of business and foundation of government and so on and so on so like in general it's a good idea if you can find you know networking is being a network administrator is a good thing or if you can write programs 

328.79 331.90 A: yeah i i remember i had programming at high school [mn] 

332.10 333.27 B: really 

332.68 339.96 A: the first level one was all right level two started getting a little harder and i didn't take the next level 

336.66 337.55 B: oh 

339.26 342.75 B: yeah i mean it's hard it's a different way of thinking about things 

340.45 341.59 A: [laughter] 

342.12 343.85 A: yeah it is 

343.17 345.83 B: it really is so i mean i'm not good at that either 

345.48 347.03 A: the programming 

346.43 348.54 B: right the programming that's like 

347.58 350.22 A: so with the maps what do they what do they do 

350.23 354.08 B: okay now for instance if we were going to take your 

354.19 358.89 B: idea for the arcade and the entertainment place right 

357.33 358.17 A: yeah 

358.90 364.10 B: um we could do what's called a suitable site analysis 

364.66 369.38 B: and you know you might even want to think about this for the future just put it in the back of your mind or something 

368.68 370.16 A: mhm 

369.54 372.00 B: but what you do is um [lipsmack] 

372.23 385.01 B: like i don't know well for instance we'd have to look at zoning [lipsmack] you know where certain types of business is allowed everywhere or are there just certain zones where the local government allows business 

383.11 385.84 A: (( mhm allows you to put your business yeah )) 

385.14 389.09 B: yeah like maybe you can't be within a thousand feet of a school 

387.87 393.71 A: yeah i learned that last last semester in school i didn't know that 

390.72 392.33 B: yeah right 

393.28 399.81 B: yeah 'cause there are you know some places are zoned for residential and some are zoned for industrial and some are zoned for 

400.08 404.01 B: oh light industrial or you know business and so on and so on 

402.53 403.47 A: mhm 

404.19 405.40 B: so then 

405.74 409.72 B: so what we're looking for is the best place for your new business 

409.86 417.09 B: and so we take into account for instance the zoning [lipsmack] then we would look for um 

417.70 422.22 B: is there like a high school nearby or an elementary school nearby 

421.78 422.98 A: mhm 

422.58 428.16 B: uh that's see that'd be like your clientele that'd be where your business would come from would be those people 

426.75 427.66 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

428.30 437.59 B: so you'd want to be fairly close 'cause these people are probably too young to drive if we're going for the younger crowd so they'd have to walk or bike or something like that 

431.94 432.95 A: mhm 

437.63 444.14 B: and so we're looking for zoning and we're looking for um nearby schools 

443.76 444.86 A: mhm 

444.26 446.13 B: and you want it to be 

446.52 448.69 B: um a safe part of town 

448.47 449.90 A: yeah 

449.28 458.23 B: so we could look at uh crime statistics you know the police department would have that and 'cause some police departments are using this computer mapping 

454.12 455.16 A: mhm 

457.63 458.69 A: they are 

458.38 460.06 B: yeah more and more 

459.04 460.63 A: (( mm uh-huh )) 

460.54 462.20 B: and 

462.37 466.60 B: well let's see like i'm really going on and on in this but then the next step would be 

466.54 475.58 B: to look and see if there are any uh competitors close to where like for instance if you find a a building that looks good 

475.45 486.92 B: then we'd we'd look at that building it's location 'cause it's all about location in relation to the schools in relation to the zoning and then in relation to any competitors 'cause like if there's one across the street 

486.69 487.84 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

487.45 489.24 B: you know maybe it's too much 

488.16 503.10 A: i know if i opened up one of those things like if money was not an issue if the if the company could have like like a bus like have like a certain stop like a regular bus but it was just for that that would bring a lot of business 

492.97 493.90 B: (( [cough] yeah )) 

501.58 502.57 B: okay 

502.67 504.17 B: yeah it could be 

503.64 505.61 A: i've never seen that before 

505.27 509.78 B: that's a great idea [laughter] that's a great idea like a shuttle 

505.98 507.16 A: [laughter] 

509.12 517.98 A: yep just like a little bus to stop like at a certain points to pick up 'cause i know when i was growing up i wished i could've got around like that 

512.33 513.62 B: yeah 

517.43 519.02 B: oh yeah 

518.18 523.33 A: but if they could do that that would that would kill all competition nobody does that 

522.63 527.98 B: [laughter] it'd be great advertising too there you go 

523.41 525.08 A: nobody 

525.46 526.76 A: (( [laughter] just )) 

527.61 531.02 A: to pick up pick up the kids and drop them off at a certain time 

530.43 534.16 B: yeah and 

532.03 533.14 A: (( i don't know )) 

533.22 536.54 A: i go to school i have a couple of ideas 

536.28 538.91 B: that's great that's a good one 

536.77 537.84 A: [laughter] 

539.14 545.36 B: but you see how how how i was describing you know you can use this mapping business 

542.84 543.92 A: mhm 

545.65 549.72 B: to look at to find the best places for a new business 

549.36 553.25 A: so how do the police use it you work you do any work for them 

552.84 558.83 B: no i had a class from a guy who did the mapping for uh the county sheriff's department 

556.40 557.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

558.84 566.31 B: and he was describing some of the things for instance like if there's a certain corner or intersection that has more accidents than some other place 

565.92 568.68 A: oh then that's where he'll put like a traffic light or something 

568.01 578.75 B: yeah they could either put a cop out there or uh put a traffic light like you say they might want to go from a four a four way stop sign thing to a regular traffic light 

578.74 585.20 B: or if there are certain neighborhoods that have a certain type of crime like mugging or something you know they can uh 

583.12 584.18 A: mhm 

585.91 587.40 B: [lipsmack] put more 

587.86 591.09 B: uh patrols or whatever and that kinda thing 

590.98 595.92 A: is there any other thing you would do besides that or that's pretty much what you would like 

594.64 597.03 B: well see that's a good question 

597.26 598.79 B: (( and [cough] ))
