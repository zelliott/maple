180.84 189.01 A: and he was had requested from one of the black boys um to uh go ahead and promote his album 

188.95 203.68 A: and so uh he started doing that and it just led from one to another person to another person and the people from nashville started calling him and so we decided to open this so we're getting ready to do a big benefit because of course we were 

189.45 190.66 B: oh 

196.67 198.15 B: wow 

203.65 213.03 A: part of the country who's been hit by these tornados and so we're getting ready to do a benefit and bring quite a few people in to help out on that

209.53 210.59 B: yeah 

210.73 211.65 B: (( [sigh] )) 

211.94 213.88 B: oh uh-huh 

212.93 219.11 A: so that this is an interesting topic because it's not even a hypothetical it's a real topic 

218.66 219.65 B: right 

219.21 222.32 A: and we just like last week put a name to it all 

219.89 221.37 B: well mhm 

222.51 226.87 B: well also it's a joint business it's a joint business 

222.59 223.59 A: so 

225.06 226.17 A: right 

227.12 231.76 B: and had you ever c- um you know conceptualized ch- um 

232.01 238.49 B: going into if you were say with again hypothetical if you were not married say you know 

238.60 242.87 B: would you go into a different kind of business or 

242.01 243.87 A: well see [sigh] 

244.09 252.43 A: i i have thought about doing just the basics we've got four kids and i thought about doing like the flea market type of thing 

252.34 256.25 A: you know you can you can go with a business on that depending on 

252.51 253.60 B: oh 

255.28 256.49 B: uh-huh 

256.13 270.96 A: you know where you are and we're at the four state region right on the corner and so i've got four states that i can get into pretty easily so yeah i have hypothetically thought about doing that and using the funds to finance our kids' educations 

256.88 258.95 B: (( oh yeah uh-huh oh uh-huh )) 

269.39 270.59 B: oh 

271.31 272.41 A: (( so mhm )) 

271.35 278.50 B: you could almost combine the two like have your benefit and have i mean th- they're outdoor activities 

277.92 278.99 A: right 

279.20 280.19 B: uh-huh 

279.66 283.43 A: that would that's a great idea that's a real great idea 

282.19 285.74 B: i i'm not the first one to think of it i wouldn't think 

284.59 285.83 A: [laughter] 

286.33 287.36 A: (( so uh )) 

286.45 289.45 B: [sigh] but uh were you affected by the tornado 

289.17 300.71 A: we were not my us per se but we did have family members and my i am divorced and so my my children's um father's home 

300.73 309.41 A: um is no longer there as well as lots and lots of people you know that we've been acquainted with so 

307.96 322.06 B: uh-huh [mn] uh-huh mhm so if you like if we weren't discussing money that back and you know and you had an opportunity again you know to h- have your own business apart from your husband um j- it seems like this is mostly 

322.09 325.63 B: would would i be correct in saying that this is your husband's 

325.91 326.97 B: business 

327.09 338.91 A: yeah no basically it's both of ours because i'm on the end of knowing he moved here to marry me and so i know i know a lot of the people and i also 

334.25 336.50 B: oh 

337.30 339.55 B: oh 

338.84 344.62 A: i also know how to do the financial ends of it because i have like an accounting degree 

342.39 344.51 B: oh you're you're like an accountant 

344.51 359.32 A: right and yes and so i can basically do of the l- he does the legwork by getting out there after i make the appointments and and everything and he has the end of knowing the uh the pitch 

345.36 346.94 B: oh really oh 

353.68 354.52 B: uh-huh 

359.03 359.93 B: uh-huh 

359.17 368.61 A: and and knowing if somebody has stage presence to be able to book them and i have the end of getting knowing the venues that he can contact 

362.71 363.60 B: uh-huh 

368.21 370.45 B: did you go to school for that 

369.84 374.95 A: uh-huh i have a yeah i have a bachelors in accounting and marketing 

373.38 375.59 B: masters degree in accounting 

375.52 376.66 A: right and mark- 

375.61 378.01 B: i hope you weren't connected with anderson 

377.85 379.35 A: no [laughter] 

379.07 382.95 B: [laughter] my brother got stuck with merrill lynch up here 

382.62 384.43 A: really [laughter] 

383.51 386.74 B: (( oh uh-oh )) 

384.68 391.76 A: yeah well i tell ya i i learned real quick you you don't put all your funds in one place [laughter] 

390.88 392.38 B: uh-huh 

391.87 394.53 A: so um [mn] 

393.65 395.66 B: but anderson's still big 

395.29 396.90 A: yeah it is 

396.94 410.18 A: uh so we we basically we're a good team to where and i've also although i have a degree in accounting like i said i have four kids and so i own my own business as well and have for ten years which is a daycare center 

410.10 411.56 B: oh really 

410.32 424.75 A: and right and so between us we we have three businesses altogether but like i said you know i'm looking into opening a new one in the flea market type of thing ebay and that sort of thing 

416.35 417.08 B: oh 

422.39 423.37 B: oh 

424.85 426.01 A: um 

425.02 434.08 B: seems like there'd be a lot of antiques out that way for some reason i feel like in that [mn] that four state region there would be 

433.53 435.78 A: um especially missouri 

435.67 450.63 A: they have an awful lot um haven't seen a lot in in like in a if we would go two hour radius to each one of the states um i would say missouri would be our best opportunity because they have an awful lot of things like that 

436.09 436.98 B: uh-huh 

437.47 438.38 B: uh-huh 

442.99 444.00 B: uh-huh 

444.36 445.22 B: uh-huh 

448.13 448.93 B: uh-huh 

450.58 452.56 B: w- now would you um 

452.63 458.18 B: [mn] [lipsmack] you know hypothetically would you would you have uh an indoor flea market 

457.90 464.34 A: y- probably i probably would not go to any of the trades for a day i would probably probably rent a booth 

464.47 475.60 A: um and depending on uh how much draw that that particular flea market brought in that would determine what size of booth that i would want to rent 

474.08 478.16 B: oh remember there's no there's no money in um you know we don't have to 

477.01 478.32 A: [lipsmack] okay 

478.35 484.59 B: see in a way this is difficult for you because you have to s- you're an accountant and you have to suspend all your 

483.59 486.97 A: that's true [laughter] that's how my mind thinks 

485.70 487.91 B: (( very difficult for you )) 

487.40 488.87 A: (( mhm )) 

488.17 494.34 B: you know you probably talk to a lot of people uh every day uh who have pipe dreams 

492.20 493.18 A: oh ver- 

493.66 506.91 A: that's right and it's all worked around money you know that's that's a okay hypothetically yes i would probably do an indoor uh because of it could sell while i wasn't there 

495.67 496.67 B: uh-huh 

497.71 500.05 B: uh-huh right you gotta bring them 

502.28 503.37 B: uh-huh 

507.34 509.16 B: right uh-huh 

509.40 515.71 B: it could sell again you're thinking you're thinking along the terms it's very difficult for you to get away from the money 

516.23 525.31 B: from the money um uh [lipsmack] aspect you know that's because you are an accountant you know it's come it's come very difficult you know 

519.49 520.57 A: mhm 

521.50 523.47 A: [laughter] 

524.34 525.43 A: mhm 

525.45 529.37 B: probably everything that you see you have a penny 

529.60 531.16 B: penny sign 

529.89 535.07 A: that and when your when you've got four kids and three of them are teenagers 

532.93 536.30 B: oh yeah oh i'm not making fun of you 

535.61 544.10 A: oh no oh i understand that but you do you you look at at expense and what you need for tomorrow 

536.51 537.90 B: oh i i 

537.93 539.46 B: i respect you 

544.09 545.24 B: oh yeah 

544.67 547.10 A: and and so 

547.12 555.70 A: i didn't realize with the question how hard that would be to change yeah so you just look at dreams and and 

550.46 551.56 B: (( for you )) 

553.87 556.43 B: oh yeah don't you feel drained 

556.62 557.75 A: uh 

557.95 561.04 A: yeah [laughter] 

559.29 562.66 B: [laughter] it's like 

561.88 563.44 A: definitely 

562.77 573.38 B: that's this is my you this [mn] that's like you're you're um [lipsmack] your s- the center of your universe don't you think it's like [mn] you know how go in there 

569.65 570.74 A: uh-huh 

573.43 577.51 B: but ah you're a perfectionist see i'm a dentist 

577.17 578.63 A: you are 

578.11 587.91 B: yeah and i but i've over the last twenty years i've done a diff- totally different kind of dentistry it has more to do with psychiatry than anything 

588.14 594.65 B: and so i've become kind of an adept at you know uh at anal- analyzing people 

594.27 595.50 A: mhm 

594.97 598.68 B: you know who are different different ways um 

599.06 599.95 B: probably
