72.02 73.28 B: [noise] [laughter] 

76.62 81.37 A: i don't know let's see if i were able to open my own business 

80.75 85.95 B: i once read this book about starting your own business and it was just like 

86.29 95.09 B: [lipsmack] it it was like three hundred and sixty five ways to open or to start your own business but it really it was more it was more about uh 

95.45 101.98 B: ways to get started then it was about different ways to do it or like different businesses to do 

102.21 108.31 B: and it just it had a couple of ideas in there and it had this one about this uh newsletter 

108.63 112.96 B: that was like i guess the first chapter [laughter] and pretty much the only chapter i read 

112.99 119.78 B: but uh it had this i- it gave me an idea that i might try and start a newsletter or something like that [lipsmack] 

119.76 129.12 B: i don't know i- i thinking about like uh doing something local and [mn] starting like a a club type thing where people would just like be on a 

129.09 139.26 B: meet on a written format y- on a written forum or something like that you know and that would be the newsletter everyone would like contribute to it [lipsmack] i thought it was a good idea but [lipsmack] 

139.64 141.37 B: i don't know [laughter] 

140.79 143.46 A: (( mhm [laughter] i don't know that it might work huh )) 

143.41 145.24 B: yeah 

143.55 147.53 A: well i've been thinking well another business is teaching um 

147.78 156.54 A: [lipsmack] giving lessons for the um computer i have been approached by a few people that would that wanted me to teach them how to use the computer 

156.62 158.38 B: oh really [noise] 

157.47 159.33 A: so that's um 

159.34 162.12 A: a thought as well um 

160.10 160.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

162.34 176.97 A: maybe even you know teach some kids how who'll have it during the week um i'm not sure yet if it would be like how much i would charge per hour or or would it be per week but um that's a thought too to um 

166.87 169.08 B: [noise] 

173.60 176.37 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

177.18 178.87 B: yeah 

177.67 179.74 A: have my own business teach 

180.20 182.25 A: i think i'd be pretty good at it 

180.45 183.04 B: i'm not very good at the computer [laughter] 

182.45 189.95 A: oh i'm i'm i'm really good i mean i'm not an expert or anything but you know i'm i love being on the computer 

184.29 185.38 B: (( really )) 

185.56 187.01 B: [noise] 

189.99 199.33 B: really i like i like surfing on the internet but i i'd i don't know anything about computers and sometimes i [noise] get real frustrated 

190.10 191.65 A: (( ah yes )) 

197.72 206.08 A: well i don't the technical aspects of it but you know i could teach someone how to use you know the basics or whatever 

203.82 204.89 B: yeah 

206.19 207.22 A: um 

207.82 213.34 B: i've tried to like uh i got like this [mn] card greeting card program 

207.83 209.03 A: i'm sure mhm 

213.55 218.20 B: and it's kind of like uh fifty thousand different cards on it 

217.74 219.17 A: right i have 

218.25 223.06 B: that w- that would be good idea to like make cards [mn] as a business you know 

222.60 228.90 A: yeah that would work too and sell them cheaper than what the s- hallmark or you know the other stores would sell them for 

227.66 238.92 B: [noise] yeah i tried to make a card for mother's day and [noise] and i just got so frustrated finally er after like three hours trying to figure that thing out i finally printed one out [noise] 

229.14 230.23 A: yeah that 

238.34 240.19 A: oh y- you didn't finish it 

239.93 249.66 B: [noise] well i finally printed one out but i was on there for a long time [noise] trying to figure it out [lipsmack] but i don't know i didn't really read the book i was just trying to make a mother's day card 

250.06 255.61 B: [noise] but [sigh] it i guess once i use it a little bit more it will be easier quicker 

255.96 256.57 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

256.99 262.48 B: but that's um pretty much all of my ideas for a business i don't know [noise] 

262.34 269.19 A: i haven't really thought too much i mean i i've always wanted to have my own type of business but it would have to be something 

269.37 270.23 B: [noise] 

269.84 271.65 A: you know that 

271.87 275.05 A: would be re- really really flexible flexible 

274.67 275.88 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

275.05 287.28 A: because you know i'm ill i'm not able to really work outside the home so that's why you know i have these other ideas on you know what i can do at home on the computer and you know because i'm pretty good on the computer 

285.12 296.06 B: yeah oh it's there's definitely some something lucrative [mn] there's lots of possibilities that you could have on a computer you know 

287.34 288.33 A: you know 

296.48 302.37 A: but yeah and i've even tried posting at ah different colleges and everything to do typing 

302.48 307.49 A: for people um yeah i used to be in a legal secretary when i was working [laughter] 

303.43 304.90 B: oh really 

307.18 309.48 B: so you can type real fast [laughter] um so so you 

308.49 311.96 A: well yeah i used to be [laughter] able to yeah i can type 

310.95 312.65 B: (( know that's another thing but )) 

312.03 313.71 A: (( i'm not )) 

312.75 315.52 B: (( i mean i've actually kind- tried that and )) 

315.16 321.89 A: (( very good typer so um [noise] )) 

317.07 318.74 B: (( didn't have really much success )) 

319.84 320.54 B: (( with )) 

321.93 322.94 B: (( it really )) 

323.20 327.56 B: oh i would think that different schools would want people to type stuff 

325.73 326.88 A: well it 

327.15 338.64 A: i don't know um i i like i said i went to different colleges and posted uh on the board that i was available um and i really didn't get too much response 

338.36 339.51 B: [mn] you didn't 

338.99 343.40 A: so maybe there's another way maybe that is something i can do but uh 

343.41 354.16 A: i didn't try or yes i did i did- i even p- posted in the uh the local paper here [laughter] too but not for long you know it costs money to keep an ad in the paper 

349.28 350.57 B: really 

352.39 354.79 B: you didn't get any kind of response 

355.21 356.59 A: (( very little )) 

356.96 358.17 A: very little 

357.79 358.74 B: really 

358.36 363.67 A: yeah i didn't know if it was timing you know uh it maybe it's something i could try again 

363.36 364.90 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

363.72 367.75 A: ah a- and it might work this time i i don't know but um 

365.69 366.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

368.58 375.48 B: yeah i'm my newsletter thing my idea was that i was just gonna like find different ways to make money working 

375.51 377.88 B: not really just at home but like 

377.98 381.96 B: different ways like [noise] you could sell c._d.'s or 

382.03 383.47 B: you could ah 

383.71 393.55 B: go sell some clothes c- on consignment stuff [noise] like that and i was gonna put like different stuff like that in the newsletter and just write about my experience 

387.77 388.33 A: (( [mn] )) 

388.45 389.41 A: yeah 

392.82 402.96 A: well that's another thought too that that could work yeah you should maybe give it s- [mn] uh try it out have you spoken to anyone about it have you shared your idea with anyone 

393.80 395.56 B: [noise] 

400.80 407.54 B: no i've i've i've i've kinda been trying to do a little bit of research i went to this consignment store and i'm 

407.59 420.37 B: i swear they told me that it was like they were going to [mn] send me a letter in the mail and tell me everything that i had consigned and the different prices that they were going to put on i didn't price my own things they were going to price them for me 

419.91 420.87 A: uh-huh 

420.53 435.16 B: and this was back in like march or february and i haven't received anything in the mail so i guess it was just a bad experience with that consignment store and i haven't gone back there to find out what what the outcome of my [noise] consignment [noise] stuff was 

435.21 437.18 B: and i probably should but 

437.08 444.08 A: yeah maybe you should follow through on it or try you know foll- i'd still follow through on that one and also try a different one mhm 

438.24 440.58 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

441.37 442.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

443.84 451.26 B: [lipsmack] yeah and i was also gonna like just kinda of [noise] make some phone calls and [noise] call around and just 

451.13 460.98 B: i don't know i i guess i got kinda side tracked but [noise] i did have a program on c- on my computer for like a publish- publishing n- newsletter type thing 

461.05 464.42 B: and i was gonna use that so it'd would probably be easy if i just 

464.59 472.42 B: could like it i guess it has like different formats and stuff for newsletters and i haven't really even installed it yet 

472.89 477.46 A: yeah and and there is another thought actually i guess i do think of all this a lot [laughter] 

475.60 479.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

477.50 479.43 A: um selling on ebay

530.74 543.16 A: yeah i mean i've just looked but i've never purchased anything 'cause i'm afraid i'm like oh what if i don't really get it and i lose my money heh [laughter] but then on the other hand i'm like well i could maybe try to sell it but i don- really don't know 

534.09 535.50 B: [noise] [laughter]
