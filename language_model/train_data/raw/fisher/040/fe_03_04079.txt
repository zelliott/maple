0.06 4.36 A: hi my name is chang and i'm a college student in uh 

4.39 6.24 A: philadelphia pennsylvania 

5.94 12.29 B: hi my name is amy and i'm a stay at home mom in fora texas 

13.02 15.33 A: okay so does the conversation start now 

14.99 16.72 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

15.70 17.92 A: okay uh do you want to start or should i 

17.86 20.54 B: um you can go ahead if you want 

19.28 20.13 A: okay 

20.31 32.81 A: um i [laughter] am actually um i didn't tell you in my introduction but i'm actually a philosophy major also so i'm not [laughter] actually a very practical person [laughter] in any sense so um 

32.99 40.42 A: [lipsmack] i think if i was to start a business i think i'd probably start a food business and i was actually thinking about this 

40.46 54.50 A: uh like ten twenty minutes ago when i was walking around town and i was thinking to myself wow you know these restaurants look like they're making a lot of money or at least it seems like a pretty enjoyable business and um 

52.70 54.10 B: mhm 

54.61 64.17 A: i think it would be o- or at least my restaurant business would be an absolute failure because i [laughter] don't think that i'd be able to 

60.70 61.47 B: [laughter] 

64.20 65.25 A: um 

65.28 73.05 A: necessarily provide the sort of menu that people would appreciate i think i have a pretty eclectic eclectic sort of um 

73.45 81.91 A: food preferences and um i think in order to kind of bring together the sort of things that i enjoy i 

81.98 92.41 A: probably would waste too much money trying to buy the materials and then not charge enough and then feel bad for people if they won't show up to a restaurant or offer free food or something [laughter] 

85.56 86.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

91.73 92.69 B: yeah 

92.46 93.96 A: yeah 

93.16 94.19 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

94.49 106.67 B: well i have actually thought about this before as well and what i've always wanted to do is just um open like a pet grooming place because i love animals 

104.77 105.50 A: (( uh )) 

106.68 117.77 B: and um so it would have to be something to do with a- with animals you know um whether it would be like a house sitting um where when people go out of town you go take care of their pets for them 

111.06 112.04 A: mhm 

117.33 118.37 A: mhm 

118.01 120.93 B: um or just a g- a grooming 

121.03 130.46 B: um type of business and i think i would be successful in the sense of t- well for taking care of the animals because i just love 'em so much but 

122.48 123.44 A: uh-huh 

129.67 130.60 A: mhm 

130.57 140.24 B: on the financial side and business planning and all that i don't think [laughter] i could do that i would definitely have to hire someone to do that for me 

132.55 133.44 A: [laughter] 

140.24 150.52 B: and um my husband he owns his own business so he could probably help out in that sense of it but i think it would um be really interesting to do that 

149.22 154.08 A: uh-huh uh-huh so you're not you don't have you're a stay at home mom 

153.85 154.95 B: yes 

154.18 155.81 A: as a yeah that's 

155.07 162.35 B: i um actually i was working for peer one at the home office and we had our baby in about eight months ago so 

162.31 173.26 B: we um decided for me to stay home then but if i ever do start working that's always a possibility to um to start my business you know because that's what he does so 

170.52 171.55 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

173.52 175.88 B: but i don't know if i could ever do that or not 

175.58 180.71 A: oh so d- are are you planning to just basically stay at home for the time being or i mean are there 

180.77 184.56 A: actual- like concrete plans on actually going back out and working again 

184.44 189.47 B: i want to you know but i wanna to wait for the baby to get started in school 

185.53 186.41 A: mhm 

188.72 190.55 A: [noise] mhm mhm 

189.86 191.61 B: and but i do plan on 

191.23 204.19 A: yeah actually that's an interesting kind of point i i go to um i actually uh have no idea if we're supposed to stay on topic [laughter] um but i uh actually go to a women's college and um a lot of i've been talking to my friends about um 

200.58 201.26 B: (( uh-huh )) 

204.40 209.38 A: [lipsmack] the idea of you know the stay at home mom and also you know is it 

209.53 210.51 A: um 

210.59 222.66 A: [lipsmack] like i i don't know i guess is it fair to h- to for a woman to have to you know start her career and then just sort of i mean i guess in some sense you don't give it up because you can choose to go back 

222.20 223.29 B: mhm 

222.65 237.62 A: but just um i mean i don't know like to go through the schooling and go through all that educational preparatory stuff and then you know you get married and it's a great time and then you end up having a child then i mean even though it's kind of a um 

237.69 245.80 A: you know like a shared decision that the mother will stay home like whether that's i don't know i mean i guess that's a discussion that comes up every so often 

240.97 241.81 B: right 

245.84 246.68 A: so 

246.03 253.21 B: oh i um i wanted to just because i don't want anyone taking care of my child while they're young 

248.70 249.73 A: mhm 

251.24 252.27 A: mhm 

252.77 253.84 A: yeah 

253.24 260.99 B: so that was nothing that i complained [laughter] about i went to s- i went to college but i didn't complete my degree 

260.55 261.84 A: mhm 

261.08 265.01 B: um so i'm not i guess you're how long have you been in school 

264.63 268.53 A: well i'm gonna be a senior next year so yeah 

266.71 267.68 B: uh-huh 

268.77 272.53 A: but i don't know i mean it's just it's just interesting i guess 

272.31 274.70 B: yeah and that's something that you don't think you could do 

274.75 282.27 A: um i don't know i mean it's just one of those things that i guess i think about and i'm not really in th- in the position to 

282.18 288.54 A: think about well what's gonna happen when i get married you know because [laughter] i mean i that's not something that's occurred to me yet 

284.65 285.80 B: right 

287.99 289.09 B: mhm 

288.46 301.51 A: so i don't know i mean it's actually um i mean yeah i c- i uh can agree with you in terms of uh you know you d- you don't really want somebody else taking care of your child when they're that young you know because you don't know who you can trust so 

298.14 299.32 B: right 

301.13 302.85 B: well some people um 

303.27 304.67 B: don't mind 

304.32 305.42 A: yeah 

305.04 312.92 B: keep to keep working you know and take their child but back on the subject [laughter] we'd probably better get back on the subject here 

306.79 307.90 A: yeah 

312.34 313.60 A: [sigh] i know 

313.10 314.07 B: um 

314.35 315.74 B: [lipsmack] let's see 

315.90 318.11 B: what was the full question just 

317.36 321.43 A: it was uh just about hypothetical situation of the restaurant 

321.88 326.22 B: and starting your own business yeah if you would be successful or not 

323.23 324.47 A: yeah 

326.92 332.71 B: i think to start your own business i think you have to um really en- want to do 

332.72 336.39 B: or be interested in that field do you know what i mean 

336.09 337.20 A: mhm 

336.97 340.19 B: does that make sense you have to have your heart there 

338.23 339.33 A: um 

340.21 351.75 A: [lipsmack] i don't know how much i agree with that i think sometimes the motivation can just be financial i think for a lot of people it's just like well what can i do to make money 

346.90 347.80 B: (( uh-huh )) 

351.33 352.42 B: right 

351.83 354.18 A: and they end up doing something that 

354.21 366.74 A: you know they can deal with i mean financially but they don't really like have their heart there i mean the what they have their heart is the business slash financial part but not really like what they're doing 

363.91 364.79 B: mhm 

366.79 372.43 B: yeah i i i agree somewhat but i think that if you did if you did go into um 

372.77 377.17 B: something that you're not really into i don't know if it would last you know 

376.37 377.43 A: mhm 

377.46 385.53 A: well i think if it's something that you have your heart in totally i think you might i think a person could get um very much wrapped up in it 

385.15 386.21 B: (( mhm mm )) 

385.61 389.25 A: and prob- and and may lose um 

389.40 395.83 A: i don't know the ability to make really sound decisions i feel like like for example if you have a restaurant and you um 

396.59 400.94 A: [lipsmack] um i don't know you you are really involved and you have your 

400.81 411.86 A: like you throw your soul into it and then it it's it's not doing well i think you might start to like mortgage your house or like sell your car and borrow money from people even though 

411.96 419.06 A: like it might not like you know like in your heart that it's not going to last but even though because you love it so much 

418.79 419.94 B: right 

419.43 428.26 A: yeah so i don't know i i feel that way i sort of sometimes feel that it's good to be involved and like what you do but to love what you do can be a little bit um 

428.28 429.83 A: harmful [laughter] 

429.49 431.67 B: you think i don't know [mn] 

430.98 445.37 A: yeah i i don't know i guess it's that sort like that's the only part practical of you know practicality that i have i think it's just if you get too involved with something you have you make less sound decisions yeah 

438.22 439.17 B: uh-huh 

443.90 447.15 B: right well how long have you thought about um 

447.18 450.86 B: opening like a restaurant is that just something that you were throwing up 

448.43 449.48 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

450.15 460.36 A: i mean i think about it every so often i mean i'm a big i don't know i i i guess i like going out to eat and i always feel like oh well you know this might be a nice thing to do but i mean um 

458.24 459.34 B: mhm 

460.42 474.02 A: i guess i've thought about it for a while but i don't think it's necessary something that i could i could do either just because of um i mean there are a lot of other issues that go into it like you know like wasting food and just the money thing so 

473.37 474.37 B: right 

474.02 479.65 A: yeah i don't know i mean i don't know how seriously you've thought about the um pet grooming uh thing 

474.57 475.70 B: i think it 

480.18 484.34 B: i um i've really thought serious about it because 

484.41 497.00 B: well whenever we go or when we take trips or anything we hire people to come in and take care of our our dog and i just thought that was and there's not a whole lot of those around at least there's not here w- in this area where i live 

496.99 505.40 B: so that's something that i've really been thinking about lately and my husband even said you know if you want to just you know do that and but 

505.51 514.87 B: it's i haven't actually looked into it you know to see what what um what it takes and i haven't really thought deep into it [laughter] yet 

515.28 524.77 A: mhm mhm i mean um do you think like um that the community where you live would um benefit from having a business like that 

525.02 526.79 B: yeah i think um 

526.93 530.55 B: i think any area [mn] wouldn't you think so 

530.26 543.95 A: um yeah i mean i think you know just having different businesses in an area is a good thing but i guess um my question is you know with the way the economy is going and i mean i guess pet grooming would be considered like a luxury item 

543.96 545.40 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

544.58 548.65 A: like how do you think that would fare in this sort of environment 

548.93 553.94 B: well the pet grooming thing might be um might not 

553.99 563.52 B: do so well right now but as far as people taking or going out of town or like for business trips and things like that they don't want to take their animals to um 

564.36 565.61 B: (( a um [lipsmack] )) 

565.71 578.69 B: a boarding place all the time you know what i mean some people don't want to take their animals out they wanna leave them in the um the environment of their own house to make them feel comfortable so i think that's something that would always do well 

568.70 569.26 A: (( [mn] )) 

573.69 574.89 A: yeah 

578.28 579.33 A: yeah 

579.12 583.44 B: but the pet grooming yeah that may not um since it's a luxury 

583.33 587.51 A: yeah 'cause i mean i think it's a really good idea um actually um 

587.87 599.89 A: [lipsmack] i travel between philadelphia and new york and in new york there's just i mean there are a lot of pet grooming places you know that are um on the upscale side and you know people bring their pets all the time and you have you know celebrities bring 

596.08 597.14 B: mhm
