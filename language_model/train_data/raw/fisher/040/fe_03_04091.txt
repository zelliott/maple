1.90 3.62 A: hi i'm laurie 

3.64 4.22 B: (( hi )) 

4.72 5.92 A: how are you 

5.63 7.40 B: good how are you [laughter] 

6.59 9.95 A: fine thanks [laughter] this is my first time doing this 

9.21 11.05 B: oh really oh cool 

10.48 12.11 A: is it not yours 

11.66 13.02 B: this is my third one 

12.68 16.83 A: oh dear i honestly have no clue what to do so [laughter] 

15.88 20.07 B: [laughter] yeah i'm not really sure what they're listening for so i guess we just talk [laughter] 

19.45 26.27 A: oh okay they said hypothetically if we had money was no object how we would open our own business 

25.67 27.19 B: yeah what would you do 

27.65 35.96 A: boy it just takes me by surprise um about a year ago my family opened a small barbeque restaurant so i think i would open some sort of 

36.30 39.02 A: restaurant uh a large one 

37.42 38.46 B: cool 

39.37 40.86 A: maybe a pizza 

40.79 41.89 B: mhm 

41.35 42.88 A: what do you think you would do 

43.18 48.44 B: um i've been freelancing for the past year doing graphic design work so i think i would 

47.18 48.60 A: oh wow 

48.71 52.83 B: i would probably continue with this and open a graphic design business [laughter] 

52.29 54.11 A: oh that would be great 

54.50 57.65 A: and so you've been successful for a year and i'm 

58.10 61.45 A: then you would be successful longer than that 

60.88 65.52 B: yeah i think so i mean i wouldn't really call it successful we've been uh 

65.71 68.45 B: solvent i guess for a year but uh 

67.66 69.25 A: [laughter] 

69.73 81.38 B: [sigh] yeah um i guess i would or i should i should say [sigh] um focus more on um [lipsmack] sales and business development work um 

81.37 88.46 B: that i've found is like the toughest part of being self employed uh book handling doing the work as well as looking for the work 

88.01 94.90 A: uh-huh okay so you do most everything yourself that's was i was going to ask you what about hiring people or um 

92.00 93.00 B: yeah 

94.94 97.51 A: you know getting others to work for you 

97.45 108.55 B: yeah i i guess i'm not really big enough for that 'cause i'm working out of my home um [lipsmack] i don't know i hadn't really thought about that how was how are you guys being doing with being in business for a year or 

101.82 102.80 A: uh-huh 

107.56 117.29 A: um it it's probably the worst time to open a business but really it's picked up since last year we've been pretty busy it's just our family we don't have anyone 

110.43 112.26 B: [sigh] oh [laughter] 

117.30 125.64 A: so i think if money were no object i would uh hire some people [laughter] that would uh help quite a bit take 

121.51 122.58 B: mhm 

124.59 127.43 B: how many people do you have working there and all your family 

127.42 138.67 A: ah my brother and my parents run it and my brother's wife and their two kids and then my two boys and i help in the summer and a couple of times a week and my sister and her three kids 

137.29 138.09 B: (( oh wow )) 

138.70 141.35 B: wow that's great 

139.55 140.45 A: so 

140.78 142.28 A: yeah we're pretty busy 

142.41 146.66 A: how are you open or you just work every single day 

146.76 151.84 B: [laughter] um [lipsmack] probably not every single day i'd say maybe like 

152.35 156.84 B: f- four to six days a week it depends on the week really 

156.42 157.53 A: mhm 

156.90 163.02 B: um i mean being like self employed i'm definitely able to make more of my own hours and i don't really have like 

161.60 162.41 A: right 

163.06 165.61 B: core hours that i work or anything 

164.99 178.38 A: mhm you know what's really becoming um popular are day spas and i think that would be so interesting to do i might if the restaurant didn't work out i think i would open some sort of day spa 

175.56 176.56 B: [laughter] 

177.96 179.72 B: yeah that would be fun 

179.26 180.50 A: uh-huh just 

179.75 186.79 B: that'd definitely be good especially because it's like with each customer they're paying like a a higher premium too for that type of thing 

185.23 192.76 A: yeah yes and we could take advantage of all of the uh services [laughter] that we would offer too 

191.08 193.87 B: right right right yeah [laughter] 

193.55 195.26 A: oh that 

194.33 195.57 B: that would be fun 

195.52 201.08 A: what was the other questions i i didn't get to write it all down ah about being 

199.62 203.90 B: um i think uh what would you do to be successful 

203.32 206.28 A: oh okay what would we do to be successful 

204.41 205.73 B: (( and that type of stuff )) 

206.46 211.69 A: well i think that starts even before you open it don't you you have to do a lot of research and 

211.03 218.61 B: yeah a lot of research and definitely like building up your network of either vendors or potential clients too to get you started 

216.64 217.73 A: mhm 

218.05 221.58 A: mhm and location is so important 

220.05 221.01 B: mhm 

221.78 222.77 A: um i'm 

221.97 226.62 B: where are you located with uh your pizza business uh i'm sorry your barbeque business 

225.54 235.73 A: barbeque um well i live in the country and we're in uh indiana it's in a a larger town and it's in a pretty good spot the the 

236.16 237.55 B: (( oh wow hm )) 

236.80 242.10 A: metropolis it's quite a bit of traffic there and they researched that so that was that was good 

241.86 245.17 B: and i'd imagine they probably don't have a lot of barbeque in that part of the country 

244.55 247.78 A: there really isn't no no not at all 

246.62 248.26 B: (( that's pretty neat that's neat )) 

248.36 250.56 A: are you in a big town a big city 

249.73 251.02 B: i'm in boston 

250.71 258.16 A: oh wow yes i you know i think of boston when i think of graphic design or something like that [laughter] 

255.28 256.86 B: [laughter] 

257.74 263.79 B: yeah it seems like a pretty popular city for it [laughter] i don't know if that's good for my business or not but 

263.91 266.38 B: there's definitely a lot of designers here [laughter] 

265.99 276.86 A: uh i oh great well that sounds very interesting that i i'm not talented crafty artsy in the least so that's that's very very interesting 

273.62 274.63 B: [laughter] 

276.70 280.99 B: i wouldn't know the first thing about running a a restaurant what have you had to do with that 

280.96 288.52 A: um i i like i say i wasn't so much we farm for a living so i wasn't so much into that but um 

284.61 286.54 B: mhm oh wow 

288.61 295.33 A: they have the smoker out back cook their own meat do everything from scratch we make everything cut up 

293.61 294.62 B: wow 

295.53 299.48 A: the meat and we have no one else working for us 

299.27 300.30 B: mhm 

299.58 311.15 A: was just a strictly family and it's very it's small it it's just a carry out so i would like to branch out into either dining in or at least a drive through or something 

304.37 305.25 B: mhm 

310.29 311.81 B: [lipsmack] oh that would be nice 

311.24 313.27 A: like that yes it 

312.40 316.93 B: you could do like a big dining in thing like in the summer time with like the warm weather and all [lipsmack] [mn] 

315.05 315.96 A: (( yeah )) 

316.38 320.36 A: yes we have picnic tables out back people do come and eat under 

320.56 323.58 A: we have a canopy they eat under that in the summer 

323.29 324.57 B: oh that's nice 

323.89 328.05 A: um but yeah to make it indoors because we can't be open all winter [mn] 

327.37 328.53 B: mhm 

328.54 332.58 A: it's just a carry out so that's something i would look into also 

333.22 336.69 A: but i there's a lot of work having your own business it's 

336.02 338.69 B: yeah yeah i hear ya [laughter] 

339.40 343.48 A: [laughter] oh dear what else do we say um 

342.83 344.18 B: (( um hmm )) 

344.38 349.15 B: what's i mean if you run a farm that's that's definitely self employment right 

348.23 362.38 A: [mn] yeah that is true uh-huh and i guess i could go so far as to say if money were no object to even expand our farm land's expensive now i would sure buy some more we have two boys and if they wanna do that i'd like to have enough for them to 

355.67 356.61 B: mhm 

362.32 364.58 B: mm what type of farm do you have 

362.68 363.86 A: be able to

369.08 372.58 A: raise our own beef it's grain fed beef yeah we enjoy it 

371.95 375.23 B: oh so does that is that sort of fueling the barbeque then 

375.07 379.16 A: no [laughter] i never thought about that [laughter] 

378.35 381.41 B: have your own ecosystem set up there [laughter] 

380.09 394.42 A: yeah that's true boy we could have a really that's that's really true i never thought about it yeah we don't do that he buys all my brother buys all his meat already prepared and well i mean he cooks it but it's there in roast so 

385.05 386.43 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

394.06 395.10 B: mhm

403.23 404.09 B: wow 

403.64 411.69 A: i'll never forget the first day we tried it because we didn't know anything about barbeque and [laughter] we spit it out we tasted it and [laughter] spit it out 

411.00 412.82 B: [laughter] 

411.81 413.71 A: so he's come a long way 

413.66 424.15 B: [cough] that's funny i i love barbeque and like there's um a chain of barbeque restaurants i know they have a branch in chicago um called brother jimmy's 

414.80 415.99 A: it was 

420.55 421.59 A: really 

424.93 429.31 B: oh what is it brother jimmy's chicken shed no no brother brother jimmy's barbeque that's it

428.79 430.03 A: oh wow 

429.72 437.07 B: and it's fabulous i really really like it i know it's not um like traditional like north carolina barbeque but it's 

431.80 432.98 A: is it good 

436.23 437.15 A: uh-huh 

437.17 443.83 B: it's really really good and like they've got several branches in new york city now as well and uh yeah it's good stuff 

442.70 455.86 A: i've not heard of that i know they say the south is famous for their barbeque we don't have a smokey taste to ours um we don't care for the smokey taste and people around seem to really 

447.81 448.38 B: (( mm )) 

450.60 451.27 B: (( hm )) 

453.23 454.32 B: yeah 

455.94 460.77 A: like it um we haven't advertised that much it's been word of mouth 

460.17 462.62 B: oh wow that's great 

460.78 466.37 A: so i i too would advertise more um get the word out 

464.01 464.94 B: mhm 

466.22 478.55 B: yeah actually i need to do that for myself more because it's kind of like you know the cobbler's children who have no shoes here i am a graphic designer and i've you know worked on business cards for other people but i still don't have my own done [laughter] 

466.48 467.31 A: write a bit 

472.51 473.56 A: oh 

474.99 475.89 A: uh-huh 

477.70 479.39 A: oh [laughter] 

478.94 486.29 B: like i put up my website and like that's designed of my branding and all but [lipsmack] i don't have my own business cards or letterhead done yet 

485.61 494.98 A: oh isn't that funny well you know it's really expensive to advertise in the papers and magazines and uh it's very very expensive 

487.08 487.88 B: (( mm )) 

491.59 492.65 B: yeah 

494.05 502.87 B: [sigh] i think like word of mouth or doing like imprinting like if you have like t. shirts that have your logo on it or like even like balloons that you can give away at a fair or something 

498.93 500.08 A: uh-huh 

502.35 503.80 A: that's an idea 

503.36 507.88 B: that's i i think that really goes a long way if you can get like your logo out there 

507.63 515.08 A: we would mail out our menus we would we pounded the pavement quite a bit the summer before we opened passing out our menus 

514.45 515.60 B: mhm 

515.36 520.58 A: then we expanded a little into a delivery business over the winter and that really was successful 

521.01 527.37 A: so there's so much so much to do and be done and if money were no object i think you could really 

521.85 522.94 B: that's great 

527.79 529.42 A: make it bigger and better 

528.15 528.78 B: hm 

529.33 532.31 B: mm how did you decide to go into barbeque [noise] 

532.46 533.47 A: um 

533.77 543.64 A: my dad had just heard about it he was going for h- open heart surgery and said as soon as he got out of that he was going to and and he did [laughter] that's what they did 

541.79 542.89 B: wow 

543.95 545.29 B: that's great mhm 

544.96 552.73 A: yeah really it's but he's always wanted to open a restaurant and so he finally did i don't know why he waited till the economy was so bad to do it 

551.71 554.14 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

553.41 563.44 A: [laughter] but it it's going like you say with word of mouth and there have been two other barbeque businesses in town but they went out of business so uh we've been very fortunate 

562.85 564.91 B: (( oh wow mm [lipsmack] )) 

564.30 566.40 A: and so do you 

566.48 569.70 A: are you married or have a family or you do it on your own 

569.54 575.95 B: no i do it i do it on my own um my boyfriend has taken some design classes but uh 

569.75 570.87 A: your business 

576.15 583.21 B: yeah maybe if i'd had like a lot of like production heavy jobs like wedding invitations or something like that i would definitely bring him in to help with that 

580.69 581.37 A: uh-huh 

583.05 586.93 A: so you have done that in the past weddings and things like 

586.15 597.98 B: yeah yeah i do um weddings everything from like stuff for private individuals like doing all like the print collateral that goes along with weddings to um corporate websites and stuff like that as well 

596.70 599.95 A: oh wow oh you've really expanded into
