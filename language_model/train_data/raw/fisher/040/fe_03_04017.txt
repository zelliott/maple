370.90 373.15 B: and one of the best friends 

373.20 376.04 B: had been um found b- 

376.23 391.23 B: suspected of setting all these fires in the arizona area on these big big houses and he was a big environmentalist and he didn't believe in people ah you know building houses in like c- cons- conservation areas 

378.58 379.90 A: oh 

380.83 382.67 A: mhm 

390.53 391.83 A: okay 

391.52 398.97 B: [noise] and so the um the friend actually after about a year had passed and he was still being 

399.18 407.79 B: and a as a suspect and they were watching him and they caught him on videotape the friend finally just the friend finally decided to wear a wire 

403.56 404.83 A: oh boy 

408.21 411.24 A: oh my gosh okay 

410.05 415.75 B: yeah and so he really didn't want to he was you know they were both very ah 

415.81 427.88 B: [lipsmack] churchgoing good people and everything and he just said he took him to the grand canyon and that he just felt like he would open up there because he would feel like nobody was following him or 

427.17 429.64 A: oh sure open area 

428.40 438.66 B: nobody would and he could you know trust his friend his best friend and um and the guy confessed that he was responsible for setting all the fires 

438.19 440.29 A: oh my gosh 

439.67 442.62 B: so he got like fifteen years in jail 

442.15 444.45 A: sure [lipsmack] oh 

443.46 447.64 B: and so of course they're no longer friends or anything but 

446.83 451.81 A: yeah but that was very hard for the other fellow to do but 

447.77 448.48 B: you 

451.28 457.30 B: so at the same time would you [noise] you wouldn't commit perjury for your friend but would you 

457.44 459.79 B: you know would you set them up would you 

459.07 471.16 A: go that far i i guess when you're doing damage to other people you know i i guess i couldn't stand by and see that either 

466.85 467.66 B: mhm 

471.24 472.17 B: right 

471.33 483.09 A: i i don't always agree with our building in a lot of places we've we have a lot of that here too and it's displacing our deer and you know some of our animals 

481.06 482.25 B: mhm 

482.82 483.92 B: yeah 

483.71 489.31 A: so um that would that would be quite a question too wouldn't it [lipsmack] 

489.06 490.95 B: yeah it would 'cause 

491.05 496.75 B: i granted you want to do what's right and if your friend is burning peoples houses down that 

495.70 498.58 A: (( right right [lipsmack] )) 

496.95 498.76 B: you know and you're you're i 

499.60 502.93 B: mean these are huge houses like million dollar homes 

502.16 504.22 A: oh gosh 

504.49 510.29 A: [lipsmack] but you know you could be taking somebody's life in one of those homes too 

508.45 514.66 B: [noise] [noise] right and maybe and i mean it's not like people haven't worked all their life to have their dream home 

514.15 515.97 A: right right 

514.89 518.56 B: and there you are just torching it in five seconds 

517.17 520.39 A: [lipsmack] ah oh my gosh 

520.41 529.42 B: [noise] so i just think that i don't know how i would have handled that but his his friend honestly thought that he didn't do it he thought there was a good chance he didn't do it 

528.48 531.49 A: [lipsmack] oh okay okay 

530.48 540.44 B: and then when he found out when the guy confessed and said yeah i did it but i'm never i was i'm finished i'm not doing it again i shouldn't have done it [noise] but it was too late you know 

539.68 545.01 A: yup yup by then he had he had admitted it [lipsmack] well 

543.25 543.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

543.84 547.59 B: but they pretty much had evidence against him and everything so 

547.22 553.08 A: i was gonna say don't you think it would have come out eventually and i mean i feel that 

550.96 551.94 B: (( it would have [noise] )) 

553.18 559.99 A: [lipsmack] maybe with somebody that would commit perjury too usually in the end it's gonna come out [lipsmack] 

557.68 559.41 B: right and they said that he 

559.63 563.53 B: yeah and they said his best friend pretty much just hit the nail on his coffin 

563.39 564.82 A: oh gosh 

564.11 568.95 B: that's kind of a horrible thing to just feel as a friend that 

568.27 570.60 A: yeah i know but 

570.93 572.95 B: what are you gonna do [laughter] 

571.41 577.41 A: [lipsmack] i know i know i guess you'd have to do it [laughter] [sigh] 

576.12 580.50 B: mhm but i'm just hope to god i'm never in that situation [laughter] 

577.81 578.51 A: (( mm )) 

579.66 590.01 A: yeah isn't that true isn't that true well i don't think any of my friends would do anything too bad that i would have to lie for them i guess [laughter] 

587.53 591.74 B: yeah ho- hopefully we don't have pyromaniac friends or anything 

591.72 595.36 A: right right that's true that's true 

592.71 595.01 B: [laughter] 

595.13 595.77 B: (( so )) 

596.16 599.89 B: but it was a really interesting act- it was one of those shows that you just couldn't t-
