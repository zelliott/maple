64.29 65.96 B: (( mhm mhm ))

67.08 68.70 A: trying to get some people 

69.52 72.41 A: to to get you know signed up that way 

72.45 76.03 B: so perhaps like prospecting for business in advance 

75.63 77.04 A: yeah 

76.70 78.32 B: test out your market 

78.82 82.04 A: yeah just a little bit because i'm not ready to have too much work 

81.79 82.86 B: mhm 

82.78 86.81 A: 'cause see they said if money were not object but see time is the bigger object 

86.52 89.62 B: right good point [laughter] 

88.61 90.67 A: right now i have i have two infants 

90.85 93.46 B: oh bless your heart [laughter] 

93.58 94.85 B: and how old are they 

95.38 98.98 A: they are twenty one months and six and a half months 

98.82 100.06 B: wow 

100.28 102.41 B: [noise] you've got your hands busy right now 

102.24 104.08 A: and they're supposed to be napping 

104.29 109.49 B: [laughter] uh-oh [laughter] well let's see how long we can go right [laughter] 

108.38 110.22 A: yeah and you 

110.27 118.81 B: well actually i would like to open um christian gift and uh book store type of thing like crafts and 

119.53 123.84 B: clothing and accessories and that type of thing 

123.85 125.87 B: books c._d.s 

126.00 127.66 B: i just think that would be really fun 

127.36 131.61 A: so would you do like a walk in store or a website or both 

130.56 143.12 B: yeah i w- i would do uh well i'd probably eventually go to the website but i'd initially do a hands on where you can actually touch people and shake their hand and talk to 'em and 

140.69 141.32 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

143.32 156.97 B: pray with them if they you know have something that's burdening you know a lot of people have cancer and you know people have deaths in the family and they just want somebody to listen so i think that's really cool that we can connect with other people [lipsmack] 

157.24 160.46 B: um actually that that is one of my dreams so 

160.98 164.87 B: that's kind of a secondary thing i'm already engaged in 

164.94 171.57 B: doing my own home based business through a multi level um marketing company through the networking industry 

172.10 179.15 B: so eventually when i get to that point that's kinda something that i want to do arts and crafts and christian materials 

179.18 181.20 A: and how would you get started in that 

181.66 186.54 B: [lipsmack] ah using my revenue from my multi level so i imagine it will be 

186.55 188.69 B: probably three to five years out 

189.92 191.44 B: and then just 

190.13 195.11 A: and if you didn't have to worry about the money i mean well how do actually go about starting getting all that together 

195.97 197.70 B: ah resourcing 

197.75 209.95 B: what what sources are available as far as um materials what the costs are um just because that's something you have to do in business whether cost is an object or not 

209.57 210.73 A: yeah 

209.99 215.97 B: looking at locations i think you know the first thing to do is for me would be to kinda dream 

216.17 224.18 B: uh you know whether i'm meeting my own visionary dreams as to where i want it and how i want it to be or whether i'm looking at 

224.46 229.23 B: you know the surrounding areas or like demographics i w- i would be 

229.35 234.73 B: doing it more for myself at this point i'm i'm a little older probably than you so 

231.32 232.40 A: right 

235.23 242.89 B: i would want to uh live in an area like colorado that [laughter] i've not been there but i've heard it's really beautiful 

243.25 246.91 B: but actually i was thinking about north carolina 

243.36 244.78 A: it it's nice 

246.69 248.69 A: that's nice too i used to live there 

248.39 250.58 B: oh you did ooh awesome 

249.49 256.63 A: and it would actually there's there's probably a lot of pockets in north carolina that would be a really really good market for 

255.82 257.03 B: yeah 

257.69 260.66 B: yeah that's kind of a bible belt area too isn't it 

259.77 262.87 A: yeah it it really is 

261.57 275.18 B: yeah sweet country folk and people that you know i think we've gotten away from relating to each other that's kind of part of the reason that i signed up to do this i thought this'll be fun you know i like meeting people and connecting with people so 

274.87 279.71 A: yeah i just actually i was surprised i got a call today i signed up yesterday 

276.39 277.51 B: that's cool 

279.71 286.55 B: oh wow yeah i signed up with it last night or the night before i think it was the night before 

280.45 281.47 A: [laughter] 

287.22 290.23 A: yeah i didn't expect a call so fast [laughter] 

289.42 294.09 B: yeah that's awesome well i thought i would take the bull by the horns and go ahead and call in because um 

294.48 302.83 B: [lipsmack] i'm gonna be going out of town thursday so all these time slots that i said i'd be available well temporarily i'm not gonna be available so i thought i'd better get some calls in 

302.20 303.63 A: oh yeah 

302.95 305.28 B: 'cause i do want to participate so 

305.55 307.29 B: well what was your um 

307.49 309.40 B: do you have a website currently 

309.69 321.15 A: i do have a couple i mean just little things i've played around with really um i've been taking classes which i guess is the first step is to try to learn more about it and know 

317.33 318.26 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

321.17 322.39 B: (( sure mhm )) 

321.67 328.92 A: you know the dos and the don'ts and and then how to i mean a lot of stuff that i think is really cool i just don't even know how to do yet 

329.27 330.19 A: and 

329.28 331.11 B: good point yeah 

330.32 332.81 A: you know you can get the book and read it and i 

332.82 340.12 A: do a little bit of that but you know without any guidance sometimes it can be really hard to just sit down and read a book and figure 

340.21 346.93 B: so you almost need a like a mentor also besides capturing resources or education don't you 

340.32 341.46 A: out how to do 

346.21 354.32 A: yeah so i've been going to the classes and actually the teachers in this program are really really good in that um 

354.80 362.16 A: you know she's already you know they'll tell you okay you know it's not part of th- this course but you know when you're looking for a job 

362.34 366.99 A: keep this in mind you might wanna you know make sure you could do this or 

363.62 365.23 B: mhm mm tips 

366.61 367.85 B: yeah 

367.44 370.93 A: and they kinda help you out with that kind of stuff so that helps too 

370.78 374.92 B: that's great yeah real world tips wouldn't you say [laughter] mhm 

374.50 380.89 A: yeah exactly like right now i've been doing one for the school i used to work for i was a teacher until my first daughter was born 

381.40 386.65 A: [lipsmack] and so i still work with that school and i've been keeping their website up to date for them 

386.78 388.75 A: i created it in the first place 

388.81 390.26 A: and so like since 

388.89 391.66 B: (( mhm oh so you've already got your hand in it then don't ya [laughter] mhm mhm )) 

390.97 400.39 A: yes so since it's for a school like i've learned so much that there's so much that i just don't even have right on the website that's up there i mean it's okay and they think it's wonderful 

400.78 402.64 A: but uh [laughter] 

402.76 405.62 A: you know since it's a school i figured i'd wait till summertime 

406.01 407.28 A: to rewrite 

407.95 410.11 A: and and make it right 

408.21 409.21 B: yeah 

410.15 412.04 B: less pressure then too 

411.68 416.50 A: less less parents trying to access it and look stuff up and 

414.28 415.47 B: right 

416.82 424.44 A: not as worried if a page is down there's less pages to keep up during the summer because you know if there's no active news going on 

425.24 428.68 A: there's no hot lunch to keep up with there's no [laughter] just 

425.36 426.00 B: (( right mhm )) 

428.13 433.18 B: right all the events and activities of the normal year [laughter] 

431.16 432.30 A: (( stuff yeah )) 

433.49 435.72 A: everything that goes on during a school year 

436.31 437.54 A: yeah 

436.84 439.51 B: mhm there's a lot of yeah there's a lot of activities 

439.27 441.64 A: there's just yeah it's a lot to keep up with i- 

439.63 440.66 B: wow 

441.91 450.01 B: and some day your kids will be in school and you'll just be right there 'cause you'll have the website up and you'll know exactly what's going on if they go to that school right [laughter] 

449.81 450.69 A: it 

450.75 452.01 A: it could happen 

452.07 454.03 A: (( i don't think they'll go to that school though )) 

453.69 454.73 B: (( [laughter] no )) 

454.50 459.29 A: 'cause hopefully see colorado is nice but i don't wanna live in colorado 

459.13 461.21 B: no where would you like to live 

460.71 464.55 A: i'd like to live southeast my parent's live in georgia 

465.15 467.21 A: so we used to live in florida 

466.72 475.26 B: mhm mhm oh that's [laughter] so funny i mentioned colorado and north carolina and you're like you've lived both places and i live in florida and you're talking about georgia and florida too 

475.09 475.95 A: i mean 

475.28 476.51 B: (( that's hilarious )) 

476.11 484.62 A: yeah my my one sister lives in florida another sister is and that was uh another nice thing about website design too you can do it all over the net you can do it from anywhere 

484.24 486.34 B: that's true yeah 

485.51 491.27 A: you know i could start doing stuff here and even if i had some some clients here 

486.81 488.16 B: it would be an excellent mhm 

491.31 494.72 A: and i moved back i could still keep up with those clients 

494.30 495.72 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] right )) 

495.28 497.83 A: and do the the website for them 

497.62 498.70 B: right 

498.11 501.34 A: whereas i mean if you're actually opening up a store 

501.02 509.72 B: oh yeah you're definitely tied down and you have to worry about employees and there's overhead and administrative functions and yeah it can be a headache for sure 

501.59 503.67 A: you kind of have to be there 

509.36 512.03 A: that just sounds like a lot of work to me 

511.70 512.89 B: mhm 

512.36 513.28 A: to start 

513.53 514.86 A: and you can't just 

515.03 517.92 A: like step in a little bit on something like that you'd have to 

517.38 519.22 B: oh right yeah 

519.40 527.41 B: but i think the point you brought up was really good too about searching out basically resources of information and education and 

527.48 539.54 B: you know and then going beyond that and getting tips from people that are actually you know in that industry maybe looking to people that are successful in that industry and having them kind of mentor you or 

539.77 548.72 B: you know y- somebody that you can look up to that can actually help you succeed maybe they can let you know where some of the pitfalls are that you can avoid so 

548.17 549.36 A: yeah 

549.20 552.99 B: you know you have to find somebody that's willing to share their information some people 

553.03 555.95 B: are really great at that and some people are 

555.99 558.04 B: not so great with that [laughter] 

556.31 556.87 A: (( [mn] )) 

557.09 560.95 A: yes well some people are afraid you're gonna take it all away from them 

558.28 559.55 B: competitive 

560.34 564.26 B: right right and that's always a concern in the business world so 

564.94 568.27 B: and with a lot of people h- starting home based businesses you 

568.30 570.07 B: know like you said it's 

570.26 573.49 B: it's an open field to a lot of people because they can do it from anywhere 

573.92 577.97 A: [mn] yeah you can do it from anywhere you can do it when the kids are taking a nap 

578.45 579.79 A: so that you don't have to 

578.64 581.32 B: [noise] mhm flexible hours yeah 

581.88 585.60 A: yeah 'cause i mean that's my biggest thing i don't wanna put my girls in daycare 

585.52 597.30 B: yeah i agree i stayed home until mine was uh two and a half and then unfortunately her daddy left he was playing house somewhere else he's a bad boy so [laughter] 

594.81 596.03 A: (( oh )) 

597.72 599.89 B: and uh i had to go back to work
