52.88 57.22 B: or a close friend i don't know it would depend i guess on 

56.68 62.77 A: we- eh that what i'm say it depends on the issue though it depends on what he now if he'd a rob a bank i [laughter] 

57.44 58.58 B: the crime 

61.65 67.75 B: yeah [laughter] but if it was like murder or something that would be different yeah 

66.37 69.60 A: yeah m- yeah murder i wouldn't stand up for him but you know 

69.75 80.07 A: ah murder or something like that like if it was a lit- ch- ah eighteen year old or whatever though maybe my nephew and he this his first time and he was really sorry for him i may you hear what i'm saying

91.80 93.41 B: [laughter] 

92.95 101.48 A: well well if you but if lie they go well i guess you know i see a lot of perjury but they don't take 'em to jail for perjury most times at all they could but [mn] most times they don't you know what i'm saying 

101.01 104.67 B: oh really what do people perjure o- themselves all the time you figure 

104.31 113.00 A: [mn] i guess i've been watching too many of them shows on t._v. that's probably what it was i don't know 'cause a lot of people perjure a lot of people perjure in yeah a lot of people that i there'd be a lot there are a lot of people that lie for their families and stuff you know 

112.62 114.30 B: yeah they must 

113.92 120.19 A: they lie for their families but i [mn] but ah like i said i- i- i- i- i- it d- d- depends on if it if it just um i don't 

120.31 126.62 A: know if they called me on actually how a person really is and i knew how i might try to help him get a job they tried to or something you know what i'm saying 

126.13 127.51 B: (( oh yeah i know what you mean ))

136.11 146.20 A: you know a little white lie and i tried not to because y- you know you don't you don't want to do it because i i i'm a believer and i i try not to do all that but sometimes you know when it comes to family it'd be different though you know what i'm saying 

145.60 147.12 B: yep yeah i do 

147.29 149.10 A: yeah 

147.46 151.61 B: so i don't know ah yeah it just all depends on what the 

151.67 153.49 B: ah what the case was 

153.93 155.09 A: right what the case 

154.91 160.85 B: yeah i couldn't i couldn't really tell you just you know would i perjure myself or not i don't know 

161.18 163.47 A: (( yeah 'cause it is i- ah it )) 

161.31 166.61 B: maybe i'll maybe i'd say oh yeah of course i would but when the time came be like ooh i don't know 

166.53 169.78 A: yeah but i i i think you would do it for your mother though what you think 

170.09 171.81 B: depends on what she did 

171.60 172.99 A: [laughter] i gue- 

172.02 173.85 B: (( [laughter] and ah if )) 

173.11 175.12 A: i guess whatever my mother did though 

173.94 177.44 B: (( if i was getting along with her at the time [laughter] )) 

176.57 182.17 A: yeah but my mother's a chris- you know she's a christian woman too but ah she wouldn't do it though but i'm saying if i had to do it 

179.14 180.09 B: yeah 

180.66 185.25 B: i know my mother i don't think my mother's ever lied a day in her life actually yeah 

183.89 187.45 A: yeah yeah but i wouldn't i'm saying but if i had to [mn] 

187.46 191.20 A: if it's 'cause i love my mother i really do i really love my mother you know 

189.03 192.28 B: to protect her that's true that's true 

192.20 196.04 A: and my family members the same we i i love my brothers and sisters though you know what i'm saying 

194.77 200.51 B: but but if it was some crazy relative and you were afraid they were going go out and do it again then you might not 

199.03 199.95 A: yeah 

199.96 211.02 A: but i don't my family my family's not into that doing that crazy stuff that's the thing about it you see i know them real good they're not into it they might say a little light white lie and say look [mn] ah say i've been living here for five years or something that you know what i'm saying 

210.59 211.99 B: yeah 

211.34 213.86 A: something like [mn] that for a credit report or something you know 

212.10 215.88 B: something yeah something little like that yeah but um 

214.25 216.74 A: yeah [laughter] 

216.00 223.03 B: yeah that's a good good point you bring up too 'cause i don't know anybody that would be in this kind of situation that i would have to perjure myself for 

222.78 227.90 A: (( right and i guess it would be in an environment you got to be round though but like i say i'm not in that environment you know what i'm saying )) 

227.18 229.81 B: yeah me too yeah i do know what you mean yeah 

229.38 230.74 A: (( you know but ah )) 

230.84 240.00 A: but ah you know so i mean if if i if i want to get in trouble though i know if it had somebody's if i had to lie for them f- for the point of death i probably would though you know what i saying 

238.70 241.49 B: yeah that's yeah well 

242.33 245.58 A: (( [mn] i don't want to see anybody die though [laughter] )) 

244.35 248.64 B: ah i i wouldn't either but if they killed someone that'd be the only reason they'd be 

247.50 252.71 A: oh yeah if they if they killed somebody that's different though [noise] yeah if they killed somebody you know 

250.43 251.44 B: yeah 

252.45 253.65 B: yeah 

253.05 265.65 A: but ah but if yeah if they killed somebody but i don't know you know it it to help 'em keep their job or something like that they [mn] you know they come to me and said well look i i i told 'em i was in the doctors office i didn't go to the doctors office or something like that you know what i'm saying 

265.13 267.73 B: yeah right i agree with you yep 

266.30 268.06 A: something like that you know 

268.29 270.09 B: have you ever been on a jury 

270.32 273.31 A: [mn] [mn] you know no i never did in my whole life you have 

272.84 282.75 B: i have yeah i got called as a jury duty once and i figured you know i'd go in and sit around be bored to death 'cause i did jury duty in the past and never got picked and i got picked 

276.27 277.22 A: uh-huh 

282.96 292.44 B: and it's um it's almost comical to listen to the people get up and tell their stories and oh my god they get so personal with the questions that they ask the people 

292.27 293.61 A: right right 

292.83 294.83 B: oh my god yeah 

294.16 305.31 A: well see i lived in miami and and the way they do some of their jury duties but they ask you a question about [mn] i was up for jury many many times and i'm f- i'm going on forty this year and i'm surprised i've never been to been to jury duty but what they do they they just

401.57 406.62 A: and we thought she was in there 'cause she used to leave about four o'clock in the mo- in the morning and she'd be there at seven or something like that but 

406.75 419.38 A: she no she is there at four o'clock in the morning every day but somehow she left at seven o'clock and we had thought she w- we thought we just we just count her dead though [mn] and she waited two o'clock two or three o'clock in the afternoon and called everybody you know what i'm saying you know we 

414.12 414.88 B: oh 

417.33 426.03 B: oh we- i think it was hard for them to call out like we ah i know we couldn't call in we had to wait to hear from kerry as she she had to use her cell phone to call out 

423.17 424.13 A: yeah 

425.69 432.90 A: oh that's what it was yeah yeah yeah that's probably what happened 'cause she could- yeah and she did she may have said she couldn't call on her cell phone or something you know 

426.84 428.09 B: yeah 

432.52 437.69 B: yeah yeah but yeah kerry and sal um i think september eleventh 

433.58 434.92 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

437.94 441.65 B: was the deciding factor for them to get married 

440.27 442.55 A: (( right so you have any kids )) 

441.97 443.77 B: it really brought them together 

443.64 444.94 A: do you have kids 

444.32 448.11 B: do i yeah my kids are older my kids are eighteen and twelve 

445.00 445.86 A: yes

450.92 451.81 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

451.46 454.84 B: probably not because i wouldn't want to set a bad example 

454.81 455.83 A: uh-huh 

455.32 457.88 B: you know i i pro- i really 

458.01 462.35 B: always try to be that way i i'm not like the type of person to cover for 

461.20 464.59 A: [noise] but if if you knew your child was going to go 

464.75 468.84 A: (( to prison for five years you would lie for him if if if it counted on what you said )) 

467.50 470.70 B: no it would teach him a lesson [laughter] 

469.96 475.51 A: but not five years come on five years of time i i believe everybody deserves a first chance for something though 

470.85 473.09 B: i really would because i 

474.74 476.07 B: yeah but if 

476.66 481.77 B: telling the truth doesn't get him out of it then he must have done something wrong you know 

481.20 487.99 A: okay i guess ah i guess i guess i see differently on with you on that though [laughter] especially wh- if it's a child like your chi- 

485.22 490.95 B: yeah well because i wouldn't want him to think that he could get away with something you know 

489.89 495.99 A: [noise] no but you give him the first chance and if he did the second chance then he'll pay for it i i believe everybody in life deserves a second chance though 

495.83 497.78 B: yeah my son's had plenty of chances 

496.00 502.70 A: now if they mess that if they mess that chance up if they mess that chance up then then then i won't do it the next time do see what i'm saying

503.48 505.76 A: ah oh no i i have no kids at all ah 

504.92 505.99 B: oh yeah 

506.20 507.82 A: right 

506.87 510.57 B: i'm surprised that you feel so strongly that way then [laughter] 

510.21 512.64 A: (( yeah because oh you mean as far as kids )) 

512.22 513.45 B: yeah 

512.88 518.89 A: oh 'cause i love kids i'm crazy about kids and i three neph- [mn] two nephews and one niece that i raised up my- myself you know 

518.57 522.72 B: oh so it's like you have kids yeah so it's like you have kids then 

519.20 520.14 A: and 

520.23 521.17 A: (( huh )) 

522.14 532.65 A: yeah it's like i have kids i mean i've i i've had kids and [mn] all through my life though 'cause you know some of the relationships i've had [mn] they have kids ah some of their kids say how're you doing though they still talk to me 

528.54 529.39 B: yeah 

532.50 537.42 A: some of them just call me dad though they never had a dad before because i'm always good wi- i always was good with kids though you know 

536.71 538.43 B: oh oh that's no nice 

538.08 541.40 A: yeah and i just wish i i wish i had some kids but i guess 

541.66 545.24 A: he didn't [mn] the lord didn't bless me with none i guess so [laughter] i guess you know 

545.11 548.46 B: oh we need more people like you in the world that's nice 

547.44 552.57 A: y- yeah i love kids i get o- i get on the ground i get down and play monopoly and stuff like that you know 

552.14 554.15 B: yeah do you like teenagers 

553.74 554.76 A: (( huh )) 

554.28 556.28 B: [laughter] do you like teenagers 

556.06 557.54 A: do you i enjoy teenagers 

557.03 558.08 B: yeah 

557.58 560.22 A: (( oh yeah i played board games and everything with 'em you know )) 

559.77 564.75 B: oh really i think those are the tough years ugh i think those are the toughest years 

562.11 563.10 A: (( huh )) 

564.71 567.43 A: oh ah oh the toughe- oh yeah oh yeah 

566.27 568.28 B: oh god yeah 

567.67 569.95 A: yeah they go through a lot of stages and all 

569.51 570.65 B: oh yeah 

570.07 575.98 A: but you have to know how to deal with them and sometime you gotta use psychology on 'em and how to deal 'em that's the thing everybody don't know how to deal with a teenager though 

575.77 577.81 B: yeah it's very difficult though 

577.16 580.83 A: [mn] and then the teenagers are different because they have more peer pressure too you know 

580.38 588.18 B: they have peer pressure and they're trying to get their independence and you know you say black they say white and you're always wrong ugh 

585.91 587.07 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

587.36 599.95 A: but but but but see but see they we- yo- you got to use psychology on them because they want to [mn] they want the opposite though you know what i'm saying and w- and when you let them know you trust and the key is trying to let them know that you trust th- [mn] you trust their decisions too [mn] 

593.27 594.37 B: (( that's true )) 

599.29 599.89 B: yeah
