23.23 24.53 A: hi i'm john 

24.62 27.05 B: down all right john my name's james 

26.83 32.30 A: james okay so they're i guess they're asking if you'd commit perjury for a close friend or family member 

28.12 32.26 B: (( well )) 

32.76 36.28 B: (( i hadn't heard any question yet because i had laid the phone down )) 

35.69 44.78 A: oh okay well what they said was they said um would you commit perjury ah for a close friend or a family member and under what circumstances 

44.38 46.95 B: no i wouldn't because that's a criminal 

47.10 61.33 A: right but wh- i don't know what if like there was um [mn] you know like like you knew that a f- um a family member like was innocent of a crime but like the w- the testimony that you if you know if you told the absolute truth then they would you know 

52.09 53.24 B: (( offence )) 

61.42 64.02 A: i- it would it would look really bad you know [mn] 

63.82 65.97 B: yeah 

64.47 66.51 A: under no circumstances would you [mn] 

66.12 67.37 B: (( no i wouldn't )) 

67.65 68.99 A: really ah i 

69.13 76.89 A: i don't know i'm i'm a little torn i mean i i feel the same way but i think th- the bigger problem is that i have a hard time lying and being convincing about it 

75.76 85.56 B: (( yeah )) 

77.30 88.43 A: you know i i understand it is a criminal offence but [mn] to save like you know to save like you know your [noise] your your wife or somebody from from going to jail for a long time if you were just gonna 

88.32 93.84 A: if you were just gonna you know commit perjury which is less of an offence rather than like to keep them from getting executed 

94.43 99.62 B: well i don't i don't know about that see i'd have to be confronted with that in order to answer that question 

99.25 100.27 A: right 

99.63 103.45 B: [mn] 

100.89 101.67 A: huh 

102.08 107.52 A: so i don't know ha- ha- has have you ever had a situation where you felt you had to lie for somebody 

107.46 109.03 B: not in court no 

108.82 110.77 A: what about like just in general 

110.53 116.42 B: yeah in general yeah i've done that 

112.57 116.85 A: so [mn] [noise] so it's it's mo- it's more the court situation for you 

117.53 124.14 A: mm [mn] i don't know i i i seem to [mn] i understand the problem but for for me in court 

119.07 131.20 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

124.09 138.40 A: in court versus in real life yeah so i guess in court you know the problem is you can get punished for it but for me a lie is a lie either way [mn] which isn't which isn't to say that i don't feel like i- like you shouldn't lie in any situation i think that there are cases where you can lie 

131.84 136.38 B: yeah that's 

136.17 154.09 B: (( true )) 

138.43 139.37 A: um 

139.49 150.27 A: [mn] and the fact that the court is gonna punish you makes it more dangerous but i think there's still c- i think there still is a case in both situations you know there there are cases when it's appropriate to lie 

150.33 160.80 A: um just because you know the- there are situations where ah where the truth is more damaging than ah than otherwise so so i mean i i can't say that 

160.99 172.56 A: [lipsmack] [mn] yeah the problem is getting caught but you know there are situ- there are of course times in in in court where you know if you lie [mn] like if you lie and you were never gonna get caught so you were gonna commit perjury but nobody but people wouldn't know 

173.00 179.22 A: and and that could mean the difference between you know a loved one being in jail or being you know executed or something you 

179.26 180.88 A: think in that situation 

181.05 184.17 B: well i i really don't know i couldn't answer that unless i was 

184.09 197.69 B: (( confronted with it )) 

185.07 185.86 A: (( oh )) 

187.09 188.03 A: well 

188.15 189.92 A: (( [mn] i don't know um )) 

190.63 192.12 A: i mean i'm not 

192.63 193.41 A: (( you know )) 

194.01 198.11 A: s- perjury is just a weird thing t- to me to begin with anyway i mean 

197.63 204.04 B: (( it is it really is well i think it )) 

198.12 201.58 A: [mn] like why why is lying illegal right 

204.14 214.11 B: (( has something to do with the personal personal individual well what i'm saying there's some people will lie for nothing there's some people will lie to save someone )) 

207.56 208.52 A: (( what do you mean )) 

213.45 214.52 A: right 

213.92 220.01 B: (( yeah )) 

216.11 220.03 A: so oh so you mean some people they just lie all the time 

219.84 222.10 B: (( they would ah there's some of them that do )) 

221.92 249.33 B: (( right )) 

222.74 227.41 A: like even when they say like you say um what's your favorite color and they say red but it's really green 

227.86 230.72 A: something like that right and then 

231.30 232.73 A: well i don't yeah so 

232.82 241.46 A: [mn] i mean in general when i when i know such people right there's people i know who just lie randomly i tend to you know not make them my friends and not want to spend a lot of time with them of 

241.80 242.74 A: course 

242.79 247.97 A: um [mn] but as far as um i don't know in in a 

248.24 253.69 A: in a in a difficult situation i mean you said yourself right there there are cases where you would lie right 

253.19 257.70 B: i would ah if it was to save save somebody my loved one or somebody 

257.22 258.27 A: right 

258.65 259.94 A: have you ever had to 

259.77 262.42 B: no not so far 

260.52 264.03 A: hm i'm trying to think [mn] i mean 

264.79 266.48 A: [lipsmack] well like let's say 

267.25 274.25 A: let's say um you're you're you're driving your car right and um and somebody left a beer in the car 

274.21 287.03 A: and you're not drinking the beer or anything like that but you get pulled over anyway and you know that there's a beer in the car and the cop says is you know is there any alcohol in this car right like what would you say in that circu- circumstance 

287.89 293.49 B: well i- i- i i'd think i would just say yes there's some in here but it's not mine 

293.06 295.49 A: right but you know of course 

295.63 301.23 A: what that's gonna mean you know all the cop knows is right there's liquor in the car i pulled you over 

301.18 311.11 A: you know and now i'm gonna you know arrest you for having liquor in the car and you're gonna have to go through all this problem but if you said no and the cop and you know there was no way the cop could find this this in the car 

311.13 313.53 A: (( you know you'd be able to go on your way right )) 

312.96 316.20 B: (( yeah )) 

314.06 314.92 A: so 

315.22 319.09 A: [mn] i mean in that circumstance i think for me i would ah 

319.24 321.51 A: i would say no there isn't any beer in the car 

321.18 323.53 B: i would too i would say no too 

323.37 324.37 A: yeah 

324.51 325.43 A: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

325.73 326.69 A: i mean 

328.51 330.92 A: it's a it's a weird question [mn] 

332.57 333.47 A: but 

334.00 335.94 A: in general um [lipsmack] 

337.80 342.35 A: i don't know um so in general you'd say you tell the truth most of the time in situations 

341.04 344.73 B: (( yes i would yes i would )) 

342.55 343.50 A: right 

343.78 344.84 A: um 

345.18 348.59 A: y- have you ever lied just like for the he- for fun of it 

348.94 351.61 B: not really for the fun of it not that i know 

350.49 351.37 A: (( no i )) 

352.09 355.12 A: think i have when i was i think ah 

354.51 356.36 B: when you're a young kid you do 

355.96 357.56 A: yeah exactly 

356.59 360.65 B: (( ah would you hold on one second i gotta pick something up off the floor all )) 

357.92 368.71 A: i i mean i wasn't young all too long ago i'm ah i'm twenty four myself and ah so yeah you know i can i can i can remember times when i was you know a teenager 

360.42 401.40 B: (( right )) 

368.98 370.21 A: (( and ah )) 

370.65 373.58 A: i would just make up stuff so that people would ah 

374.14 378.74 A: peop- just you know to see what peo- see what people would think you know like 

379.15 391.26 A: go around and you know ah say that i was very religious or something like that and see how people would relate to me um you know you just try on a different persona so essentially you're lying right because you're not being true to yourself 

391.39 397.42 A: but you know if you keep that up for a long time it's basically like you're acting you know in some ways acting is like lying 

397.76 398.63 A: (( you know [lipsmack] )) 

398.94 401.54 A: and it's it's a it's a weird thing to think about i don't know 

401.78 437.93 B: (( [noise] all right )) 

404.45 405.45 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

419.10 420.04 A: (( so th- )) 

421.65 431.87 A: the greater topic of this was hypothetical situations was what the what the the voice said when they picked up i don't know it seems like we've kind of come to end of of what we can talk about about lying 

432.70 433.55 A: you know 

434.22 438.11 A: so i don't know maybe we should talk about other hypothetical situations 

437.71 442.62 B: (( [mn] yeah yeah yeah well hypo- th- th- the o- only thing about hypothetical s- situations )) 

442.79 447.99 B: you usually have to have ah come in contact with it in order to make a positive answer 

447.89 464.49 B: (( right )) 

448.37 450.62 A: really i don't know if i agree with that 

450.65 461.60 A: because like you know what they they could say is like what if the world was gonna end you know like wh- or or what if you know like what do you think you would do obviously you don't know what you would do because it's not going to happen 

462.32 464.73 A: right so like [lipsmack] but 

464.40 466.62 B: (( but then we don't know whether it'd happen or not )) 

466.58 468.99 A: right we don't know if it's gonna happen or not but 

468.43 470.96 B: (( it's a hypothetical situation like you )) 

470.11 473.52 A: but you could you could imagine what you might do right 

471.61 472.45 B: (( said )) 

473.08 478.38 B: yeah 

473.75 477.60 A: like you know [mn] um let's say ah let's 

477.65 481.66 A: say there was a tornado coming right now and you could f- and you can hear it in the wind right 

481.27 487.18 B: yeah yeah i'd go for cover 

481.83 485.39 A: i mean y- you can you can imagine what you might do right now right 

485.49 496.89 A: you know like i'd i'd right exactly you know that's that's a pretty easy hypothetical situation right 'cause [mn] you know but like okay so let's say a comet's heading for the earth and you know you're gonna die in two days [mn] 

497.40 500.38 A: can you ca- you can imagine what you might do right 

497.48 503.07 B: (( i'd try not to be there )) 

501.86 512.93 A: [laughter] all right but ah but if you knew that the world was gonna end and that you know [mn] you had a you had a last chance to say goodbye to people you love or maybe do something you never had done before like go skydiving or 

513.63 514.90 A: (( you know [noise] [mn] )) 

515.04 517.72 A: i mean i think it's useful to think about these things 

517.47 518.18 B: (( yes )) 

517.98 519.75 A: (( i- because ah )) 

518.55 537.42 B: (( it )) 

520.36 524.96 A: yeah you kno- you never know i mean it's it's just you know it's it's a it's a good exercise 

525.29 531.53 A: you know um [mn] and i try you know you've gotta also you want to prepare yourself maybe for [noise] ah 

531.63 534.41 A: for an unpleasant situation right like um 

534.76 537.24 A: you know you ever have like a a fire drill 

537.26 542.98 A: right um well i mean i've never been in a f- in a house fire before right 

537.68 541.01 B: (( is yeah ))

554.41 560.70 B: (( yeah that's the first thing you do is get out of there wherever the fire's at )) 

557.39 558.52 A: right 

558.98 563.51 A: well you might think you know well if you see the curtai- curtains catch on fire well i should try and put 'em out
