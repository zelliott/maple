32.59 34.06 A: [laughter] 

37.25 38.25 A: uh-huh 

38.87 40.10 B: and it would be 

40.14 47.57 B: right now we're into americana and stuff like that and they're doing different things with that 

47.70 56.87 B: and i don't know i think it would be interesting to just to see the different people who would come in and and if money was no object then you know 

55.40 56.69 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

57.47 61.00 B: i would put it in a big shopping mall [laughter]

62.53 67.19 B: [laughter] but ah as for my own business i don't know 

67.53 70.39 B: that would be i think that's what i would go for [noise] 

69.35 79.87 A: mhm oh i i really have never thought about it but if if i were going into it i don't know what type of business it would be but i know that first i would you know investigate ah 

79.83 85.12 A: um what the possibilities would be for success and i guess um 

86.29 96.84 A: if if it were something that needed ah rental space look for that i i- it it just came on me so suddenly that i had no idea to even think about something like that 

94.40 95.25 B: [laughter] 

96.21 97.67 B: yeah but 

96.84 106.66 A: as far as crafts are concerned i can remember when my kids were little there were they were having a fair um i- in one of the local schools and someone asked me 

106.68 118.51 A: to help so i said sure and she brought me all these clothes pins and little pieces of material and stuff oh are you kidding i couldn't [laughter] i couldn't make a clothes pin doll to save my life 

114.13 115.32 B: [laughter] 

117.97 121.22 B: i don't think i could either and i'm not that real good at 

119.33 120.28 A: [laughter] 

121.37 125.30 B: at painting and doing things like that but i think i could manage 

125.77 127.73 B: the part of the business part 

126.94 128.18 A: (( mhm )) 

128.14 137.39 A: you know if i i thinking about it now i think if i ah were to go into my own business i would like to have some sort of an employment agency 

137.30 138.17 B: well that 

137.31 150.48 A: because all the years that i worked i was in the personnel department and and human resource- sources manager in one of them and i think that would really i i really love finding jobs for people 

150.07 150.75 B: mm 

150.81 152.81 B: i think that would be very interesting 

152.19 156.63 A: i'm pretty old to start anything like that though [laughter] 

152.85 153.89 B: mhm 

154.69 158.38 B: me too i mean they they should have picked younger people for this but 

157.57 167.79 A: well i i i guess maybe they well they're when they first mentioned it they mentioned two different subjects and i can't remember what the other one was when they first called me 

167.37 170.13 B: now when they called me this was the only one she give me 

169.50 172.38 A: oh yeah w- where do you live nancy 

171.80 173.88 B: (( in ah barnesville ohio )) 

173.55 179.31 A: oh well i'm in westchester county in new york about fifty miles outside of new york city 

179.00 186.56 B: and i live in a little town so starting a business i mean we have a lot of empty spaces i could probably put anything in this town 

180.60 181.55 A: uh-huh 

186.30 187.52 A: (( mhm )) 

186.85 190.20 B: because everything has basically kinda closed down 

190.60 195.84 B: so you know you could an employment agent here would go real well [laughter] yes 

194.13 198.84 A: really really well maybe i'd better move [laughter] 

196.21 197.40 B: [laughter] 

197.72 204.14 B: because the one we had basically has closed down and you have to call an eight hundred number now 

200.68 201.67 A: uh-huh 

203.86 205.17 A: oh my 

204.54 208.05 B: and that you know you can't even sign up for employment around here so 

207.28 208.47 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

208.14 210.27 B: i think something like that would go over 

210.72 212.47 B: real well around here [noise] 

211.45 216.59 A: yeah well the when the kids were um little i stayed home i didn't work 

216.37 229.58 A: and then after they graduated from school and i was bored i went back to work when i was in my fifties and i did go to work for a um a personnel agency and i really really enjoyed it and 

229.40 235.45 A: you know if money was no object you could have a gorgeous office [laughter] 

232.72 233.59 B: (( oh yeah )) 

234.37 237.40 B: hey who would want to work if you couldn't have a gorgeous office 

236.76 239.27 A: that's right [laughter] 

238.04 250.09 B: i quit working when my kids were and basically i just by the time i got they got bigger i thought hm nobody's gonna want to hire me now you know mostly the- they'll go for the younger people but 

249.22 257.92 A: but yeah that's what i thought and i i guess i was fifty seven and saw an ad in the paper and just as a lark i answered and she hired me 

258.12 259.54 A: and then um 

259.03 261.93 B: well i really think older people are more dependable 

261.31 266.17 A: i think so too but ah most of the employers [laughter] don't think so 

262.32 263.40 B: mhm 

265.10 269.09 B: no i'm i'm even i can it myself though just in the late 

269.44 275.73 B: people here in town how they talk that the younger people are not as likely to show up for work or
