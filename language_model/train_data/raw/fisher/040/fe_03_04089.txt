82.09 82.96 B: so 

82.98 84.95 B: (( are you crafty at all yes ))

92.38 94.04 B: oh that's neat uh-huh 

93.59 96.71 A: yeah and it it was a lot of fun and um [lipsmack] 

97.28 104.30 A: but didn't really have a lot of success with with marketing it and was going to do it on the internet but saw that a lot of other people were doing that 

104.46 105.90 A: as well 

105.96 111.42 A: um and so she kind of was just you know doing it as gifts and 

109.97 113.15 B: [noise] yeah that's nice you can get a lot of different ideas when you 

112.52 113.70 A: mhm 

113.25 119.34 B: [noise] there's a lot of different concepts with baskets because you have all different events that you can make 'em for you know 

119.11 122.04 A: right right right like with 

120.57 131.58 B: and it depends how much you want to put in and i have so many baskets here i'm not sure what to do with them because i inherited a bunch from a girl that was used to doing [noise] different things with the baskets and putting material and that in them 

132.31 134.23 A: mhm mhm 

133.02 138.18 B: um i never really got rid of them thinking maybe that i'd do something else with them you know 

138.25 139.67 A: right 

138.74 141.62 B: well i've got all different sizes here pretty much 

141.31 143.44 A: [laughter] 

141.88 151.20 B: [laughter] my girlfriend's daughter got into to doing uh her own bath towels but she uses a smaller array of baskets she doesn't want any of the large ones to fill up a big basket with 

151.33 152.60 A: oh really 

152.37 159.37 B: so she provides her own uh bath salts you know potions and everything else [noise] all kinds of different [noise] things she's made 

159.39 165.88 B: and she's sold them you know to friends and that and i guess she's trying to you know she's on the internet and she's trying to get more diverse with it 

165.90 167.95 A: uh-huh right 

166.42 170.71 B: (( so that's pretty interesting but i wish that i could have gave her some of my [laughter] craft to )) 

170.06 174.88 A: [laughter] so how did she get started with that i mean is that some 

171.20 171.83 B: (( sell [mn] )) 

173.94 182.55 B: she does she does actually she went to nepal in um before she graduated i guess she was looking for a sidekick you know something to make a little extra money 

182.49 183.96 A: mhm 

183.07 188.96 B: and uh and she just sort of she went on the internet and i guess she looked up different ideas and was it was more or less a 

186.73 187.61 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

188.77 198.70 B: she ordered bottles from different companies and and came up with you know making her own solutions it was really amazing my girlfriend said her kitchen looked like a laboratory 

198.91 209.15 B: so it it was something really different but very unique you know and the the thought that she did it all with her own you know thinking her own knowledge trying to look up different uh 

209.24 212.86 B: chemicals and everything it's really something to be able to do that 

212.72 215.85 A: yeah you definitely have to have a knack for it i would think 

214.88 218.22 B: right right so i mean that was pretty darn good and um 

218.46 225.12 B: well i guess now she does it on occasions she's getting her masters uh in teaching i guess she's just got a teaching job 

224.77 226.38 A: oh really 

225.67 228.34 B: kind of does this more or less on the side you know 

228.13 229.96 A: mhm mhm 

229.05 233.32 B: and i guess sells it to a lot of her young friends 'cause she's in her twenties only you know 

233.77 243.21 B: but um so it is kind of an interesting past time it's something you know to keep you busy and i i always like to be creative i always thought it was just uh 

243.51 248.16 B: to do things on the side and you know and then try to be creative with your thinking 

246.67 247.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

248.44 250.13 A: right right [sigh] 

249.50 258.34 B: not just trying to make money i never made much money selling anything but i enjoyed you know giving it for a gift or just kind of you know using it as a creative outlet more of a 

257.95 264.11 A: mhm yeah someone just invited me to a um creative memories party have you ever been to one of those 

258.77 259.54 B: (( so ))

314.18 315.03 B: (( and um )) 

315.11 319.85 B: the thing is teaching people again people are really into it that's the big moneymaker right now

346.02 348.25 A: is it that's too funny 

347.60 356.47 B: and i you know it's funny because i i didn't wanna go on the speakerphone i was looking i have a painter here and i was looking for my other phone and i just found out about this and it 

354.17 357.48 A: [laughter] 

356.73 361.68 B: and i thought gee i'm gonna try and you know do a few little things on the side here and see what happens 

360.93 362.72 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

362.30 367.55 B: and um i didn't know if i was trying to look into what they said in the beginning because i was walking in 

367.96 376.16 B: and i thought maybe there was something you know like it was a director or somebody calling but then i thought that they said something about it's a person's like yourself and you 

376.28 378.32 B: talk about a topic you know 

377.81 379.63 A: right right right 

379.32 383.77 B: so that's the thing but um so you do any crafting yourself then or 

383.78 392.05 A: um no i don't i mean the the thing that i've dabbled in a little bit is like re- real estate related like buying a home and rehabbing it 

391.45 397.72 B: oh that's really nice too that's something i always thought was real creative too because you could get into the interior decorating line and 

392.74 394.67 A: mhm 

397.16 398.84 A: right right 

398.30 404.59 B: that to me would be really fun i mean did did you like take a do you have a degree in decorating or just do it on the side or 

404.25 412.96 A: oh i just did it on the side i took some like local courses not um degreed or anything but just you know getting ideas from different people 

412.68 414.66 B: oh that's really neat yeah 

413.64 418.03 A: [lipsmack] and then you know places like home depot they have classes as well 

417.75 419.21 B: (( oh yeah i used )) 

418.55 422.67 A: that are free and they teach you you know different things stenciling um 

422.05 433.13 B: the home depot does really they do that here in or not but uh yeah how is the housing market out in maryland is it quite diverse do they have a lot of different homes do they have like foreclosures and that or 

423.46 424.52 A: yeah 

432.58 438.74 A: oh yes yes definitely definitely i live close to baltimore and there are quite a few there 

438.54 443.11 B: oh that's really neat gosh yeah i've never been up in that area i'd been up in um 

443.70 449.07 B: uh parts of maine and different um never in baltimore but i've been up into um 

449.43 454.88 B: new hampshire vermont i just kind of browsed and went through the area i drove through it at one point 

450.26 452.02 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

455.00 465.01 B: with my husband and my husband died in december so now i don't know if i'm gonna be out there traveling a lot but but i would like to hit that vicinity again but i think the housing market again with uh 

460.08 461.01 A: right 

465.27 478.47 B: being able to do that is really neat you know to take an old home and uh without any major major work it's just more almost decorating it and you know do you have a husband in uh any other line like of helping with the major work or 

473.06 474.12 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

478.83 484.88 A: [noise] um basically i just hired contractors in the area and then you know some of them give you 

484.96 490.21 A: um ideas as you go along like one guy knew someone who did designs in ceilings 

489.81 491.08 B: oh that's neat 

490.25 499.03 A: and he tried to explain it to me and it was and it's not just like stucco or stucco swirls he does like diamonds and patterns and 

498.56 500.57 B: (( oh wow that's really neat different )) 

499.15 504.04 A: and he took me around to some other houses and showed it to me and you know and 

503.51 504.94 B: ideas yeah what 

504.29 507.61 A: yeah that just really gave it a unique flavor 

507.69 509.42 A: and um then i 

508.52 514.11 B: oh that's really neat do you get like houses in ill repair or are they in pretty good shape and you just decorate 'em or 

513.86 526.40 A: [mn] yeah you try to just find stuff that's um cosmetically distressed you know not a whole lot of major rehab but this one house the basement wasn't finished so that was like the biggest thing that i did 

519.86 520.62 B: right 

521.35 522.09 B: yeah 

525.83 530.98 B: oh i think that's really neat though and then do you like um hire people to put the kitchen cabinets and all that in 

530.73 532.47 A: uh-huh yeah 

531.73 534.80 B: that's nice yeah and then do flooring and everything 

534.46 535.73 A: (( mhm )) 

535.43 543.53 B: yeah and then again if you can get certain uh people you can work with in a vicinity you could get like you know get them to do more work at a reasonable price for you too 

542.86 545.39 A: (( oh yes definitely definitely didn't have many hours to )) 

544.71 559.48 B: that's really nice i would much rather get into that even than doing the little stuff like i said i'm not doing much of the little crafting any longer but i always wanted my husband to buy uh old houses up and tried to do that but he was uh in working for many years he had his own company 

558.19 560.36 A: (( he had uh like a family )) 

561.17 565.98 B: (( [lipsmack] oh really )) 

565.24 566.45 A: ((  )) 

566.56 572.75 B: for um you know doing anything other on the side i mean he had to keep up you know the house property and everything 

573.50 588.19 B: here and uh you know we have a little bit bigger piece of land than the normal person so it's a lot of grass cutting and that and of course now my boys are going to have to do more of it you know but um i think you know rehab and to me is just it's so interesting it's a it's a 

584.22 586.03 A: (( business so he didn't have )) 

587.37 589.11 A: (( a lot of time mhm )) 

588.24 590.11 B: money maker it's exciting 

590.21 594.26 B: to see the difference the change like that trading places on t._v. to see 

594.64 597.07 B: (( what you could do to a room you know )) 

594.77 595.82 A: mhm 

596.88 598.94 A: right right 

597.94 599.89 B: you do alteration
