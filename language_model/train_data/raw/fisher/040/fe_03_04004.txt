33.63 34.52 A: [noise] 

34.79 44.74 B: use common sense not to do something uh to begin [laughter] with so [sigh] and if they uh dare do something then they need to be held accountable like everybody else 

36.47 39.45 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah 

42.72 43.59 A: [noise] 

44.30 52.36 A: that's right that is so true but i don't know i know people do it all the time but i don't know how they can have a conscience [noise] how they could sleep at night 

51.98 55.53 B: i know it amazes me because uh i know i sure couldn't 

55.21 58.69 A: no i couldn't either i couldn't do anything and 

58.73 62.27 A: it'd bother me if i hurt your feelings it'd bother me and not know it [noise] 

61.93 66.65 B: i know in fact growing up my sister she used to jokingly call me honest abe and 

66.39 67.39 A: [laughter] 

66.48 80.19 B: you know i i you know and when i was y- younger that upset me but as i got older i thought you know that's something to be proud of that people when they think of you think of you as being honest because you know that's t- er really important to me 

73.68 74.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

79.69 82.55 A: [noise] [noise] yup that's how i feel too it's 

82.61 85.89 A: but i don't know there are a lot of dishonest people in the world [noise] 

85.44 86.48 B: yes 

86.29 91.35 A: you know and that it upsets me and i just keep saying we need to pray for the people [laughter] [laughter] 

89.96 93.93 B: [lipsmack] i know you know i i watch the news 'cause i like to be informed 

93.72 96.83 B: but there's days that by the time the news is over 

96.59 109.19 B: you know i'm just shaking my head and thinking you know at least seventy five percent of it is people that if they follow the the rules of of living [laughter] and the rules of the bible they wouldn't even be in the news on that story 

105.19 105.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

108.62 113.00 A: [noise] [noise] i know uh that's the problem i think the bible that's taken everything away [noise] 

112.51 127.17 B: yeah you know it's funny they duh the whole thing about the perjury and honesty i look at the situation right now where those uh girls beat up the other girls at the school and the school is saying well it wasn't on school property we've got nothing to do with it but 

113.89 114.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

115.59 116.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

127.37 138.25 B: you know if they were being honest with themselves since this is a tradition that they do every year you know seems like somebody would have tried to do something about stopping it before now [lipsmack] 

137.21 142.48 A: [noise] i know i can't believe that the schools let that stuff go on though 

142.23 153.45 B: i know and see now they're trying to pass the buck and to me that's that's that's another form of perjury because if you're saying well yeah i knew but it's not my job to do anything about it well 

153.34 162.37 B: you know you might as well have been there encouraging it and and now they say some of the parents were the ones that bought the kegs that were there that they were drinking from 

156.58 157.69 A: yeah and 

162.25 164.70 A: shoo mm mm mm 

163.90 176.93 B: that just you know i i i teach here an- and they just some of the parents i mean some of the things that they say and do you know i'm thinking to myself well i hope their child's strong enough to kind of develop their own 

176.99 184.09 B: right or wrong despite what some of their parents think and feel and i guess that goes back to that that family issue too 

184.26 191.66 B: yes your family is blood but you have to also be an individual and know your right from wrong and and go accordingly 

189.29 189.88 A: (( [noise] )) 

191.51 197.19 A: yeah and you have to i think they need to put the bible back [noise] in the schools [noise] uh myself 

196.19 204.89 B: [lipsmack] i saw a teeshirt not too long ago that said um when guns and things were allowed in is when god was kicked out 

205.12 206.21 A: truth 

206.24 208.08 A: that is probably the truth 

206.34 207.22 B: and 

207.63 210.30 B: yeah [laughter] i mean it just really hits home 

210.43 216.88 A: yep that is so true but i i don't know the i think though the whole system is messed up too though 

216.78 217.73 B: yeah 

217.13 222.05 A: the criminal system because i know there's people in prisons and jails that are innocent 

222.44 223.46 A: you know 

223.96 224.99 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

225.10 226.75 A: but i don't know 

225.71 231.05 B: and there's and there's a lot of perjury and covering up that goes on in general too that just 

231.24 237.12 B: you know kind of perpetuates the whole you know thing that we're talking about whether they're in jail or 

237.14 243.73 B: or whether they're in school the more you lie and cover up it's just you know it's just like a snowball 

241.85 244.61 A: and it's all it just snowballs yep 

243.80 244.92 B: yeah 

244.65 253.22 A: and and you know 'cause i ran into that with my son's girlfriend a while back she went to her church and told the biggest lie and i mean i was flabbergasted 

253.28 260.87 A: and it's like this is supposed to be a little girl that's a christian and she goes to church every sunday sunday night and wednesday and blah blah blah 

253.36 254.13 B: (( mm )) 

261.01 265.40 A: and to lie like she did and then come to find out it wasn't the first time she's ever done this 

264.87 266.08 B: oh no 

265.52 270.76 A: and i told the kids 'cause my son goes to a christian school and i said you know you just need to pray for the little girl 

270.39 271.45 B: yes 

270.83 277.83 A: she she's reaching out for help we don't know what goes on at her home you know behind closed doors nobody knows 

276.70 278.03 B: that's so true 

277.93 280.96 A: i said she's really i think she's crying out for help 

280.69 281.63 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

281.54 289.49 A: she's trying to get away from the situation or something i don't know it's sad though and i said we can just pray for the child [noise] you know [noise] it's all you can do 

289.11 290.77 B: yeah you're right 

290.46 292.40 A: (( [noise] [noise] you know )) 

291.38 293.11 B: you are so right 

293.13 294.40 A: (( [noise] you know )) 

293.69 299.47 B: this this is um my first time doing one of these this is uh this is neat it's different 

299.22 304.07 A: i know this is my first time too they called last night and i missed the call [laughter] [laughter] 

302.89 305.41 B: oh me too i wasn't home 

304.16 310.34 A: [laughter] [laughter] and it was like ten thirty last night and i missed the call and i was so upset 

309.98 310.82 B: uh-huh 

310.83 311.92 A: so 

310.98 317.15 B: yeah i i've been looking forward to this you know you never know whether they may g- uh hook us up together again [lipsmack] 

316.44 319.53 A: yeah now are you on r._m._c. [noise] 

319.10 321.55 B: um r. r._m._c. what's r._m._c. 

321.31 324.72 A: um refunder the refunding cents 

324.74 327.92 B: oh like where you get so much back for each call 

327.96 335.58 A: no no no no no no the refunding cents at the website and they talk about they talked about this program that's how [noise] i found out about it 

330.85 331.85 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] oh and )) 

334.52 340.53 B: oh no i found out about it through another program um yeah [laughter] 

337.55 339.13 A: (( oh okay [laughter] )) 

339.30 343.50 A: [laughter] [laughter] oh god but it 

340.85 342.32 B: oh wow 

342.42 353.28 B: yeah this is kind of neat i um i th- i think this one i've forgotten what the other one was called 'cause it was one of those that led from one length to another so this is like third length away three lengths away 

351.80 353.84 A: (( [noise] o- -kay )) 

353.58 357.34 B: 'cause um you know how they advertise on other ones 

356.51 357.84 A: [noise] yeah 

357.63 370.09 B: but this is really you know you you don't realize when you're talking like um like the more we were talking about the topic there is just so many different things that that can cover when you talk about perjury 

369.81 372.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah [mn] [noise] )) 

371.30 377.10 B: 'cause i guess your first thought is when you go to you know when you're in court and um 

377.40 388.03 B: [lipsmack] you're doing it before a judge and a jury but i guess perjury could be anywhere you know even in class with your teacher or like you mentioned like at the church 

387.38 389.55 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

388.61 395.38 B: any form of of not telling the truth really i mean perjury's just kind of a fancy word for lying 

395.27 398.83 A: yeah [laughter] that's the truth though 

396.21 398.45 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

398.47 400.15 B: yeah really 

399.20 406.49 A: [laughter] it really is but so we're driving down the road now it's pouring rain here in ohio 

403.77 404.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

406.31 407.82 B: oh no 

407.49 410.79 A: yeah we got off the deck [laughter] we quit doing that 

410.38 414.19 B: [noise] well we need some rain we um it's been very dry here 

411.04 411.71 A: (( [laughter] )) 

412.56 413.37 A: ew 

414.04 416.47 A: there was lightning then now 

415.54 416.43 B: oh 

416.50 418.41 A: are you on a cell phone too 

418.01 420.36 B: no this time i'm not on a cell phone 

418.79 419.45 A: (( yah )) 

420.14 422.10 A: okay see i'm on a cell phone 

421.76 431.13 B: [lipsmack] ah i see now okay since this is your first time too you don't know i was gonna ask you at some point do they beep and tell you you need to wrap it up how do they do it [lipsmack] 

430.57 437.09 A: i don't know i know that it the machine told me that it would beep in and let us know when our ten minutes was up 

436.56 437.64 B: (( oh okay )) 

437.76 441.85 A: so and and then it said we could leave comments afterward 

437.84 439.03 B: (( okay [lipsmack] )) 

441.30 442.17 B: okay 

441.97 447.59 A: so i guess it'll just come in and tell us [laughter] we're both new peas we're just learning 

444.26 445.62 B: (( yeah [laughter] but )) 

447.42 456.04 B: this this is good i mean it's pretty easy it seems pretty simple just talking and i don't have any problem talking [laughter] 

455.01 458.98 A: [mn] oh i don't either call me motor mouth [laughter] 

457.27 461.63 B: (( [laughter] yep that was one of my little nicknames they used to call [laughter] me [laughter] )) 

459.77 464.10 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

463.31 464.42 B: neat 

464.60 476.31 A: but no i don't know though it just bothers me i think they need to put the bible back in the schools and you know at least let the kids have the say so in the public schools you know 

471.00 471.91 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

475.05 481.06 B: well you know i don't know if you're familiar or if they do this up in ohio but have you ever heard of character education 

481.19 482.90 A: no [noise] never heard of 

481.92 486.47 B: okay it's like the virtues of like honesty and fairness and 

486.26 487.73 B: those type of things 

487.54 493.18 B: and it's real controversial here because some people say we shouldn't include it in our classrooms 

493.01 505.32 B: because that's something that should be done at home and through church but then the other people say well you know it needs to be included because unfortunately it's not got the same stronghold in our country that it used to be 

505.10 514.12 B: where people automatically got that growing up you know it's such a different world nowadays [noise] and you can't really go wrong by having it in the school 

514.03 521.81 B: and so they get really technical here whether you can include it or not and that's why i like teaching the grade i teach i teach pre-kindergarten 

520.77 522.44 A: (( it uh-huh )) 

521.60 534.45 B: because that way i can kind of slip those lessons in to any of my lessons 'cause since with three and four year olds a lot of what i'm teaching them besides their basic colors and numbers and things like that is um 

534.30 537.23 B: [lipsmack] what they call um social skills 

537.05 538.12 A: (( okay )) 

537.06 547.59 B: so that is something that i'm able to teach and i just put that under the social skills you know like just the basics you know the manners and saying please and thank you and excuse me 

547.43 555.65 B: and and getting them to think about like when they hurt somebody's feelings and you know like trying to avoid it and and be fair and honest 

555.58 568.79 B: and you know it's it's just so funny whenever they debate here if we should or should not be teaching that and sad that you even have to think twice if it's wrong to teach it like you know eh nothing but good can come out of it 

568.48 569.77 A: that's right 

569.08 579.13 B: 'cause i've had parents even say to me that they're seeing a difference at home the way some of the kids respond to their older brother and sisters the younger when they get home 

579.02 579.87 A: uh-huh 

580.23 581.31 B: so 

580.78 582.58 A: yep they need it 

581.97 583.15 B: oh yeah 

582.47 589.79 A: [noise] and you know with everybody it used to be you know the nineties was the thing and i don't 

589.62 597.65 A: i think people just need to read their bibles and i think [noise] well you know after the nine eleven they said church attendance did increase 

596.99 599.89 B: yes it did but isn't it sad that it took something like that
