0.27 1.54 B: hello 

0.40 1.57 A: hello 

1.63 3.09 A: hi i'm jeff 

2.65 3.92 B: i'm jeff too 

3.85 6.45 A: oh that's weird [laughter] how're you doing 

5.83 7.40 B: (( doing all right )) 

7.10 11.49 A: ah okay so um the topic is perjury i think 

10.72 11.54 B: mhm 

11.53 13.39 A: yeah i guess i would obviously 

14.10 15.39 B: and why is that 

14.18 15.69 A: depending on the situation 

16.41 17.35 B: (( 'scuse me )) 

17.36 22.13 A: ah depending on the situation i would definitely be willing to commit perjury for a friend or family member 

22.81 24.54 B: i i'm in agreement too 

22.99 23.78 A: i mean if 

24.52 28.17 A: ah are there any situations where you wouldn't 

29.13 32.71 B: um [mn] that'd be that's a good question maybe if i 

33.32 39.28 B: maybe it depends on the severity of the ah of the issue you know if a family member or a friend of mine murdered somebody 

36.37 37.36 A: right 

39.14 39.99 A: uh-huh 

39.79 43.21 B: i don't know if i could could give them an alibi 

43.17 45.12 A: even if it was a murder 

45.16 46.99 A: that you could kind of justify 

47.89 48.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

48.48 56.18 B: well that that's a that's a whole 'nother issue i mean like you know if it if it was like rage or something or accidental 

51.20 53.10 A: yeah [laughter] 

54.64 59.41 A: yeah or self defense or revenge [mn] 

57.11 58.20 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

59.69 68.12 B: yeah but i'm i'm that i c- that i mean that brings a whole you know crinkle in the scenario but definitely if it's something that 

68.41 70.01 B: [noise] that um 

71.08 74.59 B: that i feel i like could be justified but if it's just cold blooded murder 

74.38 76.31 A: yeah 

75.28 82.45 B: then i i couldn't so it would have to be something that's pretty severe but if it's something like and also probably a hit and run 

82.58 83.42 A: uh-huh 

83.48 95.28 A: [noise] all right well what if um what if this was your mother or your father and ah you knew that he or she was going to get the death penalty or be put away for life or just have some really really harsh consequences 

83.48 84.35 B: yeah 

97.97 101.45 B: i don't know because i'd have to live with my conscience you know the 

100.65 105.23 A: [noise] right but so do they right i mean maybe that's punishment enough for them [noise] 

104.89 106.61 B: fact that they did it 

106.17 111.76 A: yeah can you hear me okay ah the subway is going by right now 

111.50 112.82 B: no that's cool 

113.28 118.59 B: no i mean you bring up you bring up very good points and i just i i've had to ponder it i mean 

119.14 126.57 B: i mean these are moral dilemmas that you know that i hope hopefully i'll never have to face but i- it is it brings up an interesting issue 

121.31 122.84 A: [laughter] 

123.28 124.84 A: [laughter] 

126.74 127.60 A: uh-huh 

127.32 128.63 B: but um 

128.83 136.05 A: so basically i think we both agree that under certain circumstances we obviously would commit perjury yeah i think so too 

133.75 134.70 B: yeah 

134.74 137.98 B: i mean definitely for things that are that are not as severe 

137.50 138.60 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

138.42 140.57 B: you know like if i knew a friend of mine 

140.58 147.23 B: was having an affair an- and his wife asked me you know are they having an affair i would definitely you know perjure myself 

146.48 148.12 A: sure deny it of course 

147.86 148.89 B: yeah 

148.17 152.16 A: 'cause you know your friends come first over their wives of course [laughter] 

150.99 154.86 B: right i mean and the severity of it i mean i mean h- you know 

153.08 153.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

155.43 158.23 B: so things like that so there's 

157.56 166.91 A: so in other words i i mean i guess both of us are kind of saying that there are [mn] there are or there okay let me ask you this i mean are there absolutes you know 

167.12 169.20 A: we're talking about absolutes in a sense 

169.28 170.79 B: yeah there are absolutes 

170.64 172.61 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

172.28 177.77 B: well i mean [mn] but it's but it [mn] you can't define it on paper you just have a you have to go with your your gut 

177.66 178.61 A: yeah 

178.11 179.87 B: like the affair scenario 

179.80 181.38 A: yeah and you have to kind of 

180.26 181.26 B: (( or a fr- )) 

181.73 191.63 B: or a friend of mine lied on his resume and i knew it i'm not gonna you know if somebody asks me i'm not gonna i'm not gonna you know 

181.90 182.89 A: (( ah )) 

184.64 185.54 A: uh-huh 

189.34 189.96 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

192.35 195.56 A: have you ever done something like that have you ever perjured yourself 

194.56 196.14 B: lied on my resume 

196.04 197.76 A: well no i mean [mn] 

198.27 200.18 A: (( ah i don't know i guess just )) 

200.72 203.03 A: [mn] i mean obviously we've both li- 

201.36 202.81 B: no integrity i 

203.02 207.01 B: (( mean it's the contradiction in my persona because integrity is very important to me )) 

205.80 208.03 A: [noise] [noise] uh-huh 

207.70 209.24 B: but so is friendship 

209.42 212.73 B: but just because integrity is important to me 

213.74 218.00 B: for my own my own comforts but as far as of another person you know 

219.06 219.81 B: is 

219.83 222.24 B: (( i don't know it's it's a contradiction )) 

222.25 223.12 A: uh-huh 

222.26 226.88 B: like for my own like i wo- i'd do my best not to cheat and lie and stuff 

227.53 231.10 B: but if it came to it i mean like 

229.50 230.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

232.26 241.69 B: like the scenario if somebody approached me and said you know so and so would i lie for them then the answer is yes so i would lie for other people but not for myself 

239.08 240.01 A: mhm 

241.54 244.96 A: uh-huh so it's kind of selfless in a sense 

244.58 248.39 B: yeah like like lying on a resume i would never do 

248.45 249.37 A: uh-huh 

248.76 262.03 B: but if a friend of mine did it and i was approached by an employer or you know a coworker or something like that i would i would cover up for him so um what about you 

259.34 260.18 A: uh-huh 

260.61 261.85 A: hm 

262.51 264.40 A: ah in that same situation 

263.94 265.21 B: yeah 

264.56 268.27 A: oh yeah i'd definitely i would definitely lie for him you know 

268.10 280.35 A: there's um i'm an e._s._l. teacher and one of my little stupid discussion questions it's you know to teach a certain grammatical point but anyway so you do this by giving them these hypothetical questions kind of like you know if 

278.24 279.14 B: right 

280.58 285.16 A: um you know what would you do if blah blah blah so one of the questions is what would you do if um 

285.35 296.57 A: your friend who is recovering alcoholic ah or who is struggling with alcoholism i think is how it's worded um what if he you know wanted a job in your company you know would you give him a good recommendation to your boss 

296.70 300.90 A: you know and ah yeah of course i would i would lie even though you know 

301.20 308.86 A: ah if your friend is struggling with alcohol alcoholism you know there's if there's a chance that he's gonna you know it's gonna blow up in your face because he might 

308.91 309.72 A: (( you know )) 

310.21 313.40 A: he's like a loose cannon right i guess or something so 

312.25 316.48 B: yeah [mn] but th- th- the whole issue gets complicated so let's say 

317.13 322.53 B: [mn] let's say you did perjure you know you did lie to somebody you know 

322.61 333.76 B: and then that person did harm and had you and had you not lied if you were honest i mean let's say let's let's take the work scenario and go with you let's say um 

325.21 327.03 A: mhm right 

333.82 342.67 B: you know the person you know you're working at a plant or something and um you know this person has an alcohol problem but you really want your friend to work at this plant 

337.09 337.97 A: yeah 

342.96 344.73 B: and because of 

345.03 351.33 B: because of your recommendation he was hired you know that for a fact it was between two candidates and the foreman of the plant 

351.13 360.65 B: told you that because of your good word he got the job okay so there's no it's not ambig- it's not ambiguous who was responsible for bringing in this person to the job okay 

354.12 355.00 A: [laughter] 

360.04 361.42 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

360.96 363.93 B: and let's say because of this person's alcoholism 

364.44 366.29 B: um ah 

366.47 371.21 B: injured not only himself but also a coworker on the on the line 

371.37 373.37 B: because he was drunk now 

372.74 375.78 A: (( [noise] right )) 

374.57 376.22 B: so you know 

377.28 379.21 B: h- how how would you feel then 

379.34 380.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

380.28 382.97 A: yeah that would definitely be my responsibility you know 

382.26 385.15 B: and there's c- there's consequences for your actions 

384.66 395.43 A: sure so i guess if you were in that situation you would have to take that into consideration and then kind of you would also be kind of obligated to keep your eye on him or her you know [noise] try to 

394.13 398.44 B: you'd have to weigh it you would have to weigh it like hm if i if i do 

398.71 411.56 B: i mean [mn] and you can't be like you know you can't say well i'll get back to you you had to make a quick decision whether or not you're gonna do it but you have to kind of think in your head well what's the position what would be the re- what would be the consequences if i give him a good recommendation 

405.46 406.52 A: right 

411.87 419.27 B: i- is he gonna put himself or anybody else you know in danger because of the fact that i know he is he has an alcohol problem 

415.19 416.11 A: (( danger )) 

418.90 420.51 A: [laughter] 

419.97 423.32 B: you know what i'm saying but it's for to be an actuary or something 

423.19 425.26 A: yeah right like weighing risk 

424.08 424.84 B: (( and )) 

425.00 428.91 B: yeah where they're not doing any mechan- anything which machinery or whatever 

428.98 437.44 B: then it'd be a slam dunk of course i would lie but if i knew that you know if he was a he was a construction worker and he was you know [mn] 

431.36 432.24 A: (( mhm )) 

437.69 441.06 B: doing working with heavy equipment and stuff then i would ah 

441.66 446.58 B: i wouldn't be as forthcoming but then an- and then again i contradict myself because 

446.60 451.12 B: well it's really the plant's responsibility to do the drug testing and stuff 

451.46 454.54 A: yeah but drug testing is different from alcohol right 

453.94 456.04 B: well they still test for alcohol too 

455.95 458.53 A: yeah but how can they tell if a person's an alcoholic 

459.78 463.05 A: like they can't right there's no tests for alcoholism there is 

461.21 462.23 B: (( yeah there is )) 

463.25 464.56 A: i've never heard of it 

463.55 465.71 B: there's a urine test for alcohol 

465.67 478.29 A: yeah but that's only if they're you know if they're under the influence at that time you know if if you're if you're taking drugs and you know you're straight at that time you can still detect the drugs via the test or whatever but with alcohol that's not so true 

469.26 470.46 B: (( right right right right )) 

478.16 482.36 B: i'm just saying what can go in your mind about how to rationalize you know 

481.55 483.48 A: yeah 

482.44 489.87 B: if if the person did get injured you probably could somehow spin it in such a way that well it's really not my fault just because i gave him the recommendation 

489.85 490.69 A: uh-huh 

490.09 492.68 B: it's the plant's responsibility so 

493.29 497.26 B: [mn] i mean it i- it is interesting because um it all goes back to if 

497.75 500.79 B: you know if you if you per- if you commit perjury 

500.96 508.83 B: you know what are the consequences and if you don't let's say you're honest is that person not going to be your friend 

502.82 503.69 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

507.91 517.23 A: [mn] well he or she probably doesn't have to know you know i mean in the in the in court obviously they would know but if it's just a private consultation with the boss 

517.45 521.48 A: you could just be like oh i gave you a really recommendation but sorry guess you didn't get the job 

522.05 525.18 A: you know but in court yeah that there goes your friendship 

526.05 529.27 B: yeah because it's out in the open it's public knowledge 

527.97 528.69 A: (( yup )) 

529.30 531.13 A: [laughter] 

530.18 534.01 B: [laughter] it is interesting and it's always interesting i think when people 

535.65 539.14 B: [sigh] when people divulge confidentiality you know 

539.70 541.03 A: what do you mean 

540.95 548.94 B: well like you tell somebody you know not to not to say anything and then they go ahead and say it and then you confront them and they lie about it 

544.63 546.47 A: uh-huh and then they betra- [laughter] 

548.98 551.03 B: just because they've been caught 

550.80 552.23 A: yeah 

551.54 562.65 B: it wasn't me it must have been somebody else and you know it had to have been them ah you know i just think using your words is is so important and i'm sure you as a teacher really 

553.65 554.87 A: right 

555.51 556.65 A: but yeah 

562.85 565.98 B: i mean empha- have to emphasize that because um 

566.87 569.65 B: it's just amazing what what harm words can do 

569.52 570.61 A: yeah 

570.20 574.47 B: i mean sometimes it's even it's even worse than murder in some in some sense 

574.55 579.02 B: you know if if you lie and the consequences could be so grave 

574.71 575.80 A: yeah 

579.00 579.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

579.36 582.09 B: you know but and with murder they're already dead you know 

579.70 580.44 A: (( mm )) 

582.33 590.13 A: i'm trying to think of some consequences that i've suffered because i've lied and i can't really think of anything that's major 

591.26 595.71 B: it is i when i've lied i [mn] you know i i hated getting caught 

595.71 596.70 A: yeah 

596.20 598.82 B: and liars are is you're always caught 

599.07 599.89 A: (( i don't think so ))
