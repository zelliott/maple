32.24 34.05 B: (( hm i'd probably )) 

35.01 37.59 B: probably 

37.61 38.81 B: (( um )) 

40.28 42.12 B: [lipsmack] some type of schooling 

43.06 45.81 B: (( if you know to help kids and everything ))

50.24 51.54 B: (( mhm right mhm )) 

52.43 53.29 A: school 

54.41 56.86 A: and how would you go about doing that 

56.82 60.77 B: uh that'd be tough probably do a lot of internet research 

60.48 61.73 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

61.43 66.97 B: you know just look around see what's going on what about you mhm 

66.14 72.84 A: um i would probably do the same you know it's how to find people um in the industry 

73.49 74.56 A: see um 

74.88 84.75 A: you know how have the kind of success they had um and really just gathering as much information as i could before i just jumped into it you know 

81.75 82.72 B: (( right mhm )) 

84.96 89.75 A: um 'cause like man i i have like i'm doing an internet business right now 

89.82 101.33 A: and um sometimes i just jump into it and don't realize all the work behind it [laughter] you know and it's like i want to get out of this you know but really just going through everything before i'm i'm committed to um 

94.01 94.93 B: right 

101.86 104.28 A: [lipsmack] you know going forward with the whole 

104.47 117.72 A: you know process of you know it's a big industry the record industry you know the music music business and just really you know counting the cost before getting into that [laughter] you know there's a lot of there's a lot of labels out there 

112.82 113.79 B: (( [noise] right right mhm )) 

117.81 119.26 A: that are born 

119.29 126.66 A: within a certain year and die within [laughter] that same year and lose millions and millions you know and they're still paying 'em right now 

126.73 130.43 A: so [cough] just really looking into that to see 

130.87 134.38 A: if that would be best you know looking at all the options 

132.08 133.05 B: yeah 

133.75 138.74 B: yeah in my inter- b- internet business i don't know i'm not sure it was going on for two years 

138.95 142.09 B: (( i don't know i put a lot of money into it )) 

141.41 144.13 A: oh yeah what did you do what did you sell 

142.39 146.92 B: um a web page i sold internet service web pages 

147.85 153.20 B: and all kinds of things but i don't know it just for some reason it didn't wanna catch on 

153.01 156.54 A: mm was that your own was that the own your own thing that you can came up with 

156.06 162.38 B: well someone placed an ad in the pa- paper and i responded and the kit was six hundred dollars 

162.85 166.97 B: and he he would help you out along the way which he did 

167.20 175.41 B: and he's also struggling too so it's not working out for him he happened to live two blocks away from me which was kinda nice 

167.23 168.63 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

171.51 172.36 A: wow 

173.96 174.94 A: oh yeah 

175.39 175.95 A: (( mm )) 

175.43 176.45 B: so 

176.49 178.75 B: you know i went over to his house 

178.79 180.87 B: every once in a while 

181.37 187.00 B: but i don't know amazon worked out is working out but there is [laughter] yeah 

184.94 199.83 A: yeah [laughter] it's all in the marketing for everything you know from what i realize because you know [lipsmack] if i had lamborghinis and could sell them for a hundred bucks you know i wouldn't sell any if nobody know [laughter] about it that's the problem um 

195.10 195.96 B: oh yeah 

197.00 198.01 B: right 

198.39 199.56 B: (( right mhm mhm )) 

199.86 211.32 A: [lipsmack] but web development is definitely a big thing 'cause everybody wants a website nowadays [lipsmack] a- an idea i had for that would be to uh just go to small business owners who don't have websites 

211.37 224.14 A: that are strictly you know just buildings and just ask 'em you know i can design your website it was web design right you were designing a website or something like that yeah just go to them 'cause i guess direct marketing is probably the 

213.83 214.61 B: right 

219.36 220.57 B: right mhm 

224.31 227.46 A: the best way to get the to get the word out you know 

227.25 228.20 B: yeah 

227.49 234.21 A: word of mouth rather than putting out a million ads [laughter] and just hoping that something bites 

232.10 233.16 B: yeah i 

233.91 235.98 B: i put out brochures too 

236.24 238.65 B: ads and ads on t._v. 

238.74 245.34 B: but for some reason it didn't wanna catch on and i did it for a while it wasn't like i did it for six months 

243.07 243.86 A: mm 

245.68 246.49 A: (( wow )) 

246.07 248.52 B: (( you know and i don't know )) 

248.95 250.61 B: why it didn't catch on 

250.07 252.43 A: so did you make any money on that 

252.98 257.46 B: n- none whatsoever it was mostly just putting [laughter] money into it 

254.59 255.73 A: wow 

257.84 261.03 B: so that didn't work out too good 

260.37 261.19 A: (( oh mm )) 

261.58 265.71 B: that's too bad it didn't work out but most businesses don't 

265.80 270.65 A: [lipsmack] yeah the the failure rate is really [laughter] high [lipsmack] 

266.83 268.31 B: unless you have unless 

268.51 269.64 B: because you've 

270.13 274.86 B: like the question then i guess if you have a unlimited amount of money 

274.91 278.59 B: that you could spend i'm sure it could work out don't you think 

278.08 279.97 A: yeah i mean 

280.04 281.97 A: [lipsmack] if you spend it right 

282.17 283.35 A: um 

283.31 288.25 B: yeah i would like to another one would a made in the u._s._a. store 

288.15 289.46 A: (( hm yeah )) 

288.66 292.56 B: i'd like to do that you know just sell projects to the u._s._a. 

291.22 292.54 A: that's interesting 

292.60 294.05 B: that may catch on 

292.94 299.09 A: yeah yeah 'cause a lot of people you know they they only they will only buy u._s. made products 

298.89 301.09 B: (( right a lot of people spending )) 

299.37 302.72 A: and um that might be a big thing you know because people 

302.92 313.36 A: [noise] look at the products before like they'll look on them to see made in china oh i'm not gonna buy it [laughter] you know but if they knew that everything in the store was uh made in the u._s._a. 

308.02 309.19 B: right 

313.40 321.08 A: that's something that might pick up i think you know a lot of older americans you might wanna target it towards them 

315.50 316.37 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

321.28 322.72 B: definitely 

323.40 325.31 A: [lipsmack] so that's a good idea 

325.11 328.17 B: yeah i would think but 

328.68 337.07 B: it's just the money situation you know but like the question says you've got unlimited [lipsmack] amount of money that would be my second choice definitely 

331.17 332.14 A: yeah 

333.83 335.59 A: unlimited money 

336.44 339.47 A: yeah hm 

337.15 340.31 B: um i would imagine it would definitely work out 

340.04 341.31 A: (( [cough] mm )) 

340.80 348.68 B: but you'd probably to put what a hun- a couple of hundred thousand [laughter] and i'm sure it would catch on 

345.56 346.61 A: yeah 

348.21 351.53 A: yeah but money's not a problem so [laughter] 

350.66 354.15 B: yeah since the question says you had an unlimited amount of money 

353.44 359.01 A: yeah and that's something because if i had an unlimited amount of money i wouldn't be trying to open up a business [laughter] 

358.90 360.06 B: that's true 

359.24 360.36 A: but um 

360.20 365.07 B: yeah you would just put it in the back and then live off the interest 

364.75 368.22 A: yeah pretty much you'd wanna invest it you know 

365.38 366.44 B: [laughter] 

367.78 368.80 B: right 

368.74 371.59 A: i guess the second thing that i would do that 

372.10 375.73 A: i'm getting into right now real estate um [lipsmack] 

374.47 375.37 B: (( mhm )) 

375.82 382.47 A: i don't think there's ma- there's not much risk into it if you don't if you don't put any money down you're not really risking anything [laughter] 

382.31 383.17 B: right 

382.58 383.72 A: um 

383.93 385.99 A: so if a deal fell through 

386.10 394.57 A: uh all you've lost is your time really so i'm i'm getting into that now i think another business i would start would be that um 

388.74 389.64 B: yeah 

394.75 404.73 A: [lipsmack] only because real estate is probably the most has made more millionaires than any other industry [laughter] so um i'm getting into that right now um [lipsmack] 

400.51 401.63 B: (( oh yeah )) 

404.97 411.24 A: i hope to start a business with that and and mentor people you know like you were like schooling i guess in that 

411.31 412.47 A: and um 

412.89 415.74 A: i guess just build that up you know 

416.16 420.60 A: 'cause i guess knowledge is probably the most important thing for anything 

420.17 421.38 B: (( mhm right )) 

420.68 435.16 A: and um i just that's what i've been purchasing right now and i just graduated from uh college and i don't have a job [laughter] you know and i'm just like it's been kinda crazy so then i've been looking into you know like more entrepreneur type things um 

428.47 429.65 B: oh really mhm 

435.46 438.40 A: [lipsmack] instead of just sitting around my parents' house 

437.91 440.26 B: so you took the four years of college 

439.67 446.47 A: y- four and a half years [laughter] yeah [cough] um marketing actually business but um 

440.85 441.75 B: uh-huh 

447.07 461.20 A: [lipsmack] so yeah you know knowledge is very important and not even that they want experience so but i've been you know investing in some real estate things and i'm looking to get into that and i guess another business i would have would be to 

461.52 473.29 A: open up a corporation become incorporated because you get a lot of tax tax cuts and that or exemptions for having your own incorporation a lot of things get written off um 

473.75 476.14 A: [lipsmack] and um 

476.45 479.50 A: i guess rather than having employees 

479.30 480.24 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

479.63 489.95 A: i'd rather just mentor people who would be like you know on my team like i would teach them what i know for free and just get you know a small a percentage of what they make 

481.63 482.53 B: right 

489.97 491.09 A: on their own 

490.89 492.29 B: (( mhm right )) 

491.85 493.25 A: so um 

492.39 494.64 B: yeah that would make sense 

494.38 495.84 A: yeah 

495.56 501.69 B: that's too bad that uh four years didn't help much but i've heard a lot of stories like that do you 

500.48 503.18 A: yeah it's been kinda rough [laughter] 

502.14 508.65 B: it's like you've gotta it's like you've gotta go to another four on top of that [laughter] then you're home 

506.02 509.67 A: yeah you just gotta keep going [laughter] 

508.73 511.82 B: then maybe [laughter] if you're lucky 

509.87 511.02 A: (( yeah )) 

511.27 513.71 A: yep you've just gotta keep going you 

514.35 518.23 B: but unlimited amount of money well that would be 

518.31 529.75 B: that would be exciting you know i'm sure something would pan out if the first idea didn't work out you know the second didn't work out i'm sure eventually it would you know after a few years down the road 

528.75 531.50 A: (( know [laughter] something would )) 

531.05 533.58 B: [laughter] you would think 

531.60 532.43 A: (( give )) 

532.52 533.82 A: yeah 

533.87 534.73 B: (( but mhm )) 

533.94 536.80 A: or maybe you can just go through um 

537.50 540.73 A: [lipsmack] i don't know go through some kind of a 

540.93 543.85 A: look for an i- an invention to invest in 

544.10 547.36 A: and just sell that you know the next big thing 

548.22 555.32 A: 'cause um you know there's a lot of new things coming out and you can make a business out of that rather than uh 

553.36 558.64 B: yeah yeah my my uncle tried an invention with a bingo display 

558.73 560.95 B: but someone beat him to it 

560.41 561.60 A: (( oh yeah )) 

561.01 561.92 B: so 

561.95 565.03 B: i think he missed out by a couple of months so 

564.79 566.03 A: that's harsh 

565.79 567.15 B: yeah so 

567.17 568.89 B: cause you know i would've 

568.99 570.47 B: been in it with him 

570.93 571.97 A: (( wow )) 

570.98 576.66 B: you know his side man but that didn't work out either unfortunately 

575.95 581.07 A: you you should keep trying with it [laughter] don't stop in inventing things i guess 

577.99 579.31 B: with what the 

580.54 581.77 B: oh yeah 

580.86 594.11 A: 'cause i just saw a couple of commercials 'cause you know how like all the commercials are geared like during the day geared to people who aren't working and also they present them with a lot of money making opportunities like the inventions they have like an inventor's kit 

587.69 588.50 B: right 

590.75 591.70 B: right 

593.85 594.85 B: mhm 

594.16 599.89 A: that i'm probably gonna send away for there's a couple of different ones you know it's it's for free and you register your idea 

596.01 597.18 B: oh how much
