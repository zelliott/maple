16.07 26.42 A: okay well i have been involved in um you know different home based businesses at home but i think if i were to start something on my own and money wasn't an issue it would probably be 

26.52 29.58 A: ah i love animals so it would be something to do with animals 

29.88 32.42 A: maybe opening up a clinic for animals 

32.87 35.60 B: huh yeah that sounds good that sounds like fun 

35.31 46.01 A: yeah 'cause i love animals um [lipsmack] a lot so i'd probably open a clinic where if there were some people that couldn't afford to pay for their animals and they were in trouble that we would be able to help them 

45.28 46.89 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

46.15 50.23 A: you know with surgeries and kind of a non profit i guess you'd say 

49.85 51.73 B: yeah 

52.29 55.04 B: mm that sounds like it would be interesting 

55.29 65.88 A: right and if ah money wasn't an object well then i'd go ahead and build a facility and ah go ahead and start marketing myself on line and off line 'cause i market a lot on on line for my different businesses that i'm in 

65.67 66.69 B: really 

66.78 72.37 A: yeah so i have a few different businesses i'm opening an on line entrepreneur website 

71.98 73.08 B: oh really 

72.43 77.96 A: ah yeah so that people can network across the united states and out of you know out of the country 

77.61 78.57 B: (( wow )) 

77.91 89.96 A: but it's something i have an interest in too and i would just if i had a facility but i'd love to have my on line community going if money wasn't an object i'd use that to advertise you know get more people aware of the ah group 

88.36 90.84 B: [noise] oh yeah yeah 

90.14 93.94 A: it's called small biz preneurs so it's like two different ideas i have 

94.26 95.39 B: (( wow )) 

96.15 102.22 B: well yeah i'm just just starting out at this so [laughter] you're way ahead of ah me 

101.23 103.07 A: oh at the home based business stuff 

102.67 103.99 B: mhm 

103.84 107.72 A: yeah there's a good book i i have a newsletter for small businesses 

107.30 108.50 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

107.80 112.27 A: and there's a good book um i was mentioned in her book pricilla huff 

112.38 116.93 A: and she talks a- it's called one hundred and one best home based businesses for women 

116.52 117.73 B: mhm 

117.11 125.29 A: and she takes you through all the steps and who you need to contact if you want to start different businesses like a reminder service business or if you want to start a cleaning business 

125.68 128.25 A: or you want to do an errand business or 

127.93 129.23 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

128.42 131.90 A: you know like tour services kids parties that kind of thing 

131.38 133.21 B: mhm 

132.03 143.48 A: she takes you through all the steps approximately how much money you'd need and the different pricing guidelines and how to market and advertise and where to go and ah it's really helpful it's got hundreds and hundreds of links 

143.31 144.74 B: (( [noise] wow i like )) 

143.74 147.87 A: and ah contact names of people you can contact for different organizations 

147.22 149.43 B: that i oughta check that out 

148.75 154.85 A: well that would be the first good book to start looking at if you were looking at opening your own home business that that wasn't like you know 

152.39 154.59 B: (( yeah i think i'll do that )) 

154.64 164.12 A: direct sales it wasn't emalon if you were looking at something like that hundred and one best home businesses for women they have it a barters and do you go do you have a barters near you you 

156.18 159.16 B: right right 

163.49 164.79 B: yeah 

164.15 166.29 A: (( do okay what state were you in again )) 

165.93 167.23 B: in texas 

166.67 169.32 A: oh okay i'm in michigan [laughter] 

168.52 171.59 B: [laughter] just a little bit d- ah difference there 

171.66 174.76 B: it's about a couple of thousand miles isn't it [laughter] 

174.10 176.43 A: [laughter] just a little [laughter] 

176.75 181.29 A: so that's probably what i would do i'm not sure am i supposed to talk for not in the whole ten minutes right 

180.08 183.29 B: i don't know i've never done this before but [laughter] 

182.61 184.21 A: right right 

184.78 190.99 A: i think it said it it says um we have to you speak on the proposed topic for eight minutes i guess that means both of us for eight minutes 

190.24 194.55 B: yeah probably so i probably have to think of something to say now right [laughter] 

193.94 200.28 A: so but that's what i would suggest what kind of i guess i could help you get going by asking you what kind of things are you interested in 

199.70 210.32 B: oh probably like um you know running errands for people putting maybe putting some ads out in the you know like our neighbourhood like the th- thrifty nickel and the green sheet 

210.33 216.29 B: you know or getting to run errands for people i haven't really thought it through a whole lot but um [noise] 

215.53 217.45 A: well what kind of things do you like to do 

217.87 224.83 A: do you have any hobbies that you like to do you know like if someone liked stamping they they might open a card business and sell their cards 

224.24 226.83 B: yeah mostly j- i guess 

226.93 234.81 B: just shopping [laughter] i can't think of yeah i mean i like animals too but ah i got bit by a dog once so i'm kinda scared of 'em too you know 

228.31 229.41 A: shopping 

231.35 232.54 A: yeah me too 

234.76 237.28 A: yeah there's food delivery service you could do too 

236.86 239.03 B: oh yeah yeah 

238.03 245.76 A: which is actually pretty popular here in um the detroit area there's someone that um it's a company that for different ah 

246.21 258.97 A: you know businesses like red lobster and um you know just all the different restaurants in the area they'll take your order a- and they'll take your order they'll call that restaurant for you then have it delivered by them called delivery butler 

247.99 249.49 B: mhm 

250.77 252.31 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

259.03 259.92 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

259.48 265.38 A: and then they deliver it for you and you tip 'em like you tip 'em some money and then it costs there's like a charge for ever time 

265.15 266.29 B: right 

265.55 270.90 A: but it keeps you from having to make all the arrangements they actually make all the arrangements for you and they get paid 

269.36 270.40 B: yeah 

270.68 272.37 B: that's a good idea too

361.93 365.41 B: yeah it sounds great it sounds like a good idea 

363.81 367.11 A: and ah you you would look into the errands 

367.30 372.67 A: just how would you go about it well i would read books i'd go to ah the small business association 

373.13 379.32 A: to get information from people and see if i could get a mentor that's already done this kind of business in the area that would match for me 

378.02 380.08 B: yeah yeah 

379.44 381.21 A: there's score or something 

381.90 384.36 A: those are like different ideas that you can get some ah 

383.49 388.15 B: that sounds that's given me a lot of good ideas [laughter] 

385.71 396.53 A: yup there's scores that's what i would do score dot org is their website i'd try them out s. b. a. dot gov that's the small business asso- um [lipsmack] administra- or association 

391.15 391.90 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

398.15 402.00 B: got a whole piece of paper filled up now [laughter] 

401.22 409.30 A: yeah that's what i would do just to get going and same thing i would look into you know what the regulations are for non profit to have a animal 

409.48 412.22 A: animal rescue type of ah business 

410.73 414.18 B: yeah if money was no object [laughter] 

413.36 417.87 A: [laughter] yeah it said no money no object so definitely that would be great 

417.04 418.89 B: yeah that would be great 

420.34 421.29 B: (( [noise] well )) 

421.31 423.76 B: i wonder how long it's been now [laughter] 

423.49 425.68 A: i don't know i think we're doing all right 

424.10 424.82 B: (( is it )) 

424.98 431.96 B: yeah it's pretty good ah i this is the first time i've ever done it and i don't even know where i got this ah email from really 

432.02 433.16 B: but um 

434.36 439.65 B: [noise] i don't know it has it's not too bad i guess i didn't think i could get so many good ideas from somebody 

440.06 444.12 B: i mean it just said they're just gonna give you a topic of discussion i was well 

440.39 441.86 A: yeah it's pretty neat 

444.33 446.14 B: you know start your own business 

444.37 445.44 A: right 

446.23 448.05 A: right right 

447.13 449.44 B: get you motivated to do it i guess 

449.42 459.21 A: yeah everybody been dabbling for a while it's hard though but ah if you had the money ah i think the big problem is is a lot of people that start out don't have the money to advertise as much as they'd like to 

457.53 460.24 B: exactly mhm 

459.53 468.02 A: they have the idea they've got the means and the you know idea of how to go about it doing their they've done their research but if they don't have the money to invest in it 

463.66 464.62 B: yeah 

466.73 473.99 B: that's exact- yeah that's exactly what's kept me from starting up i've been i've been off work for three years now and 

474.11 478.31 B: yeah it's if you don't have some money to start something up it makes it pretty hard mm 

477.67 482.96 A: right that's why a lot of people do direct sales like i do direct sales for um telecom 

482.70 484.06 B: mhm 

483.38 487.63 A: um you know it's actually free to resell phone services 

486.98 488.07 B: oh really 

487.64 493.70 A: yeah so people do direct sales and they don't have that income but this said if you know income or funding is unlimited 

493.68 494.60 B: right 

494.16 497.44 A: so if funding was unlimited you'd still do the errand service do you think 

496.72 497.71 B: mhm 

497.72 500.33 B: yeah yeah probably i can't 

501.05 508.29 B: [noise] and and let it exp- probably interior decorating is what i you know what i want to probably start doing but that's kinda 

508.46 510.55 B: would be hard to get in to i think 

510.62 511.70 A: yeah 

512.34 513.46 B: but 

512.99 519.39 A: maybe unless i mean ah you know you can make your connections go to um different business meetings in the area and join your chamber of commerce 

519.13 520.60 B: mhm 

520.02 524.32 A: you know it takes a long time to get things started i know 'cause i've been dabbling for five years 

523.72 525.09 B: yeah 

524.66 526.05 A: [laughter] so 

525.30 529.25 B: well you've given me about a million ideas i wouldn't of thought of [laughter] 

528.45 531.80 A: well yeah remember pricilla huff too if you go to a um 

531.98 534.57 A: her name's pricilla h. u. f. f. 

534.65 535.56 B: okay 

535.77 539.08 A: it's everything you need to know about getting started on the road to success 

541.54 542.10 B: (( [noise] )) 

541.87 545.16 A: hundred and one best home based businesses for women 

544.74 546.30 B: (( yeah i got that down )) 

545.87 548.86 A: and then she talks about all those different businesses the errands 

549.05 556.62 A: gives you research what your target market would be who you should contact for supplies contact names for organizations all that stuff 

557.04 558.20 B: (( [noise] right )) 

560.54 565.00 B: yeah i know it's kinda hard for it's just hard to get it started i guess if 

566.65 575.89 A: yeah it's it's the capital too you know some things some things you can start with little money but then it takes forever to grow so when they said unlimited income well then you could do a lot more 

569.52 570.83 B: exactly 

571.20 571.89 B: mm 

575.61 576.54 B: yeah 

575.92 581.75 A: or you have to get into your support groups and make sure you get some good advertising and target your market and your nets 

580.69 581.96 B: right 

582.36 593.26 A: say who am i gonna go through and then go through like a list service like poke there's different like postmaster and poke you know you can buy lists for your target audience and start calling them and 

587.98 589.08 B: mhm 

591.23 593.38 B: right mhm 

593.46 599.81 A: so there's a bunch of things you can do 'cause they want to know how we would get started so that's how i'd get started i'd look into organizations i would look into and that
