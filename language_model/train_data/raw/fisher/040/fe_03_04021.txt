1.61 2.71 A: (( hello [noise] )) 

8.51 9.46 A: hello 

30.74 31.86 A: (( [noise] hello )) 

44.42 45.56 B: hello 

45.57 46.53 A: hi 

47.04 47.93 B: hi 

47.96 49.89 A: [laughter] my name's paula 

49.38 53.38 B: hi paula i'm michelle [laughter] i thought i lost you there for a minute 

51.00 52.02 A: hi 

52.78 54.64 A: yeah it sounded like it 

54.85 57.34 A: okay ah you want to go first 

55.79 62.49 B: firstly yeah so we're supposed to talk about perjury and hypothetical situations [laughter] how about you go first [laughter] 

58.89 59.79 A: uh-huh 

60.41 61.44 A: right 

61.82 63.52 A: okay um 

63.67 65.69 A: gosh that's a hard one but 

64.80 70.54 B: i know i'm trying to think of what situation that you'd put yourself in or that you'd be under 

67.04 68.02 A: um 

69.87 75.93 A: right it it it it'd depend on what it was i guess if it was perjury for murder or 

76.03 80.56 A: some of those things i'd probably not perjure myself [laughter] 

79.65 81.39 B: yeah no doubt 

80.78 82.88 A: yeah so um 

83.37 90.92 A: but let's see if it was for let's see something minor and it was for a family member 

90.89 101.62 A: 'course you wouldn't want 'em to get in trouble but yet you don't want to perjure yourself either 'cause then you're fined and in trouble so i'd probably say i wouldn't 

97.92 99.75 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

101.76 105.50 A: it'd take a lot of thought you know if it was something small but 

105.25 106.96 B: yeah i think if it was 

107.14 109.52 B: my child or 

108.47 109.81 A: right 

109.76 113.72 B: um my husband if it was something minor and i 

114.28 116.20 B: you know i really thought that 

116.98 121.60 B: you know it was a situation where it wasn't their fault or something or 

121.84 122.78 B: (( you know )) 

123.01 124.62 B: i don't know i probably 

124.80 135.90 B: i would probably feel compelled to help my child or my husband but i don't think in any other case i really would [noise] for anyone else to ever 

129.33 130.74 A: right 

133.94 135.40 A: right 

136.61 139.69 A: perjure yourself to get in trouble or 

136.74 137.58 B: (( you know )) 

139.19 142.81 B: yeah yeah 'cause i'm a a very 

140.13 141.78 A: yeah um 

143.38 155.00 A: just like some of the cases that some of the cases that are going on now like with lacy peterson and all of that i mean could you imagine having to get up there and [sigh] 

143.43 145.91 B: big stickler on telling the truth 

152.60 153.71 B: no 

155.08 157.32 A: i mean that's tough 

157.12 162.29 B: yeah i can't even imagine i mean i can't even imagine being in that situation where you would 

163.07 167.26 B: be on that kind of spot if you're put in that kind of spot where you would have to 

167.93 170.14 B: lie or something [noise] 

169.34 170.40 A: right 

170.22 175.86 B: but i don't know i don't think i i don't think i there would be very many instances where i ever would [noise] 

175.13 176.19 A: right 

176.44 180.69 B: perjure myself for any reason but i guess if it was my child 

180.14 180.99 A: (( mhm )) 

181.47 189.16 B: or my husband then i'd probably be conc- compelled then to do it but um that's probably the only reason 

182.74 184.04 A: right 

185.76 186.89 A: right 

188.86 192.05 A: you don't want to see a family member you know 

192.07 193.54 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

192.82 199.84 A: get in the [sigh] in deep water it's a hard situation between the love for them and you know 

199.88 202.41 B: [noise] yeah and then knowing right from wrong 

202.08 203.01 A: right 

202.81 205.02 B: [cough] which you know you should never do 

204.60 218.86 A: right but then on the other side you're like well if it was my child it'd be a good learning step for them you know to teach them not to lie you know for someone so i- you know what do you do you know it's like 

213.60 215.33 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

217.86 224.48 B: yeah 'cause if you're always raising your children to tell the truth and then you lie for them that doesn't set a very good example 

219.80 220.84 A: right 

221.76 223.82 A: right then then 

223.99 225.29 A: right 

225.26 236.01 A: now if it was my husband well if he got himself in trouble then maybe he ah he deserves it [laughter] that's sad huh 

231.64 234.75 B: (( [laughter] )) 

234.77 236.16 B: this is true 

235.82 246.06 A: [laughter] hopefully hopefully he'll never put himself in that position because i'd be like probably worse on him than the court system [laughter] 

236.46 239.30 B: [laughter] it's like well he 

244.66 252.16 B: [sigh] [laughter] yeah that's true i'd be like well ah you put yourself in that spot so don't put me in a bad spot to get you out 

248.36 250.81 A: [laughter] 

251.81 252.94 A: right 

252.47 254.48 B: (( [noise] that's true hm )) 

253.91 255.68 A: so i don't know 

254.50 262.29 B: unless it was something you really knew that they didn't do or and you had a felt like you had to twist the truth or something in order to 

262.00 270.00 A: right right definitely perjury would be that you knew they did it and you were holding back information so 

263.55 265.04 B: help them out but 

269.07 275.06 B: yeah i don't think i could ever do it unless -less i s- like i said unless it was my child and 

274.17 276.52 A: i know it's ah some people can 

275.12 277.05 B: and then it would be a fine line 

276.67 285.52 A: yeah some people can get up there boy and act you know like no conscience but i tell you i guess it was impounded in me as a kid you know don't lie and then 

284.27 287.10 B: [noise] yeah me too 

286.75 287.87 A: so 

288.20 290.91 A: but then like we said we want to 

288.35 289.17 B: yeah 

291.02 294.17 A: not see our kids get in trouble too so 

293.45 296.31 B: [noise] yeah 'cause you would feel like that you needed to 

296.76 299.75 B: set a good example for them but you wouldn't want to see them ever 

298.15 299.21 A: right 

299.80 301.81 A: yeah that's true but 

300.86 305.45 B: go to jail or be put in prison or who knows what god forbid [noise] 

304.06 312.81 A: and there have been i know that there has been a few cases where the dad's turned their son in or their son's turned their dad in and 

312.85 314.61 A: that's a tough you know 

314.36 317.74 B: [noise] i know i i can't imagine being in that situation where 

317.90 321.48 B: [noise] you would know if your child did something or 

322.42 324.25 B: and you would have to [noise] mhm 

323.12 335.56 A: [noise] yeah i was reading in the paper the other day that there was a son who went in and fixed a computer for their dad or something and he found all kinds of pornographic sites and stuff and he he yeah and he ended up turning him in 

332.41 333.72 B: yes 

335.64 340.94 B: you know there was one here too a wife did that um turned her husband in 

335.75 336.94 A: it's like 

339.04 339.80 A: (( mm )) 

340.49 341.90 A: mhm 

341.28 345.20 B: and it was the same situation where she found a bunch of child porn [noise] 

345.11 346.22 A: right 

345.49 347.47 B: on their home computer [noise] [noise] 

346.35 353.07 A: under that situation you know i don't i mean that would definitely if it was a family member and i knew that they were 

352.88 364.03 A: you know pedophiles after a young child if and you know my dad or my grandfather or somebody had done that i'd probably do the same in that situation you know to protect children or whatever but 

355.51 356.93 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

360.36 362.23 B: yeah 

363.76 365.53 B: (( absolutely )) 

365.12 371.68 A: so you know i guess is the whole thing would be whether or not what the situation was so 

371.61 379.03 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i it it truly is 'cause you never know what what you would do in a certain crisis situation with a family member 

378.59 379.60 A: right 

379.16 383.75 B: [noise] but i would have to say that ninety nine percent of the time i would never 

383.57 384.62 A: right 

384.44 385.80 B: perjure myself 

384.67 386.39 A: where where are you from
