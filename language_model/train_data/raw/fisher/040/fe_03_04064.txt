0.09 2.00 B: (( hello i am patricia )) 

2.46 4.26 A: [lipsmack] hi i'm brett [lipsmack] 

7.42 12.32 B: well brett if i had my own business i would have a publishing company 

12.99 14.75 B: (( and i would offer books )) 

15.80 17.59 B: children's books specifically 

19.06 25.43 B: um targeted to trying to show kids how to read with an audio 

25.54 27.97 B: tape attached to the book 

28.16 29.24 B: which will 

29.29 35.87 B: hopefully speed the process of learning how to read identify objects as well as words 

36.20 39.11 B: and putting those words um to meanings 

40.84 42.15 A: well that's great 

42.96 47.82 A: well if i were to start a business i already have a business of my own 

47.37 48.44 B: oh you do 

47.92 52.41 A: yes i do consulting work for sales and marketing effectiveness 

52.48 61.80 A: but i would say that if money were no object [lipsmack] i would probably start a business that was a little more fun and required a little less 

61.90 64.53 A: personal work 

64.64 66.07 A: and um 

66.56 70.55 A: would be along the lines of like uh an art gallery 

70.96 75.28 A: with um interactive art exhibits with 

75.54 78.77 A: using a lot of technology related 

78.93 85.85 A: um devices and display screens and those sorts of things so that people with 

86.06 90.52 A: maybe a high tech house could install those and um 

90.75 93.34 A: you know kind of target the high end um 

94.23 96.51 A: clientele with um [lipsmack] 

96.68 100.46 A: you know need for some customized solutions 

100.77 102.99 B: how will you get the pieces for the gallery 

103.68 105.57 A: i'm i'm sorry what was the question 

105.05 107.31 B: how would you get the pieces for the gallery 

107.66 115.88 A: um well i would i would look for different um artists sculptors and and technology 

116.02 117.26 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

117.62 119.66 A: let's say developers 

119.81 124.56 A: around the world that that i like their work and uh would you 

124.66 128.51 A: know offer to be a distributor and and also look for 

128.76 133.71 A: local artists that might have um some talent 

132.99 144.76 B: yeah 'cause i know a lot of authors who write other types of books so um the reason i said children's books is because we h- um i know an organization that has a program targeted um 

143.46 144.02 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

145.18 153.73 B: trying to keep our kids in school and learning how to read and i know sometimes we get our kids get frustrated when they can't um 

153.73 157.50 B: do something they get embarrassed when they can't 

157.40 170.21 B: they don't want anybody to know that they can't read or they can't do something so they pretend a lot so this would be a method the books with the audiotape would be a method where they don't have to be embarrassed they could be in be in their home 

170.36 180.66 B: or or whatever setting you know to help them along with with the reading and there could be an advanced um advance a level as you know they're willing to you know to go 

181.56 189.47 A: i see and so the um the audiotapes would be to help them to to understand what the different words were 

189.07 202.70 B: right also w- with with the objects because you know you have um uh when i was growing up in my church growing up i know they had reading classes for adults and we sometimes we just focus on the adults but you've got kids going out there who really can't read 

202.73 204.10 A: mhm 

203.36 214.95 B: they just identify you know you know mcdonalds they know burger king but they really cannot read they can't put those words together and comprehend or um know what they've read after they've finished 

214.58 223.84 A: mhm [lipsmack] and and these kids are actually getting through the the public school system and progressing to the next 

221.44 222.38 B: (( mhm )) 

222.94 229.64 B: some of them have and some of them are held back for about two or three years and how long are ya gonna hold someone back 

224.84 226.15 A: (( grade mhm )) 

229.52 230.49 A: right 

229.84 242.17 B: you know they're they're they're twelve years old and their their grades you know how long are ya gonna hold them back you need to find a method where wherever they are weak in that area you just find that method where you need to target to get them 

242.25 243.67 B: where they should be 

243.56 245.68 A: mhm 

244.99 246.95 B: and then you know go from there 

247.76 253.38 A: right [lipsmack] and um like how much money do you think you would need to capitalize this business 

252.92 266.81 B: oh i'm i'm pretty sure i'm glad money would be no object in in this thing but i think to capitalize this and the marketing of it um going state wide going through the school system probably about a a million dollars 

266.72 267.70 A: mhm 

267.01 271.33 B: just really go out there and target you know all the in the in the school system 

271.23 272.09 A: right 

271.49 279.38 B: um you know 'cause you know money is an object for them but if you could provide those tools to them well they don't have to worry about where are we gonna get this money from [mn] 

280.96 282.02 A: (( right [noise] mm )) 

281.36 282.27 B: you just 

282.42 290.23 B: here are your tools that you need you don't have to worry about the money i just need the qualified teachers to work with these kids targeted specifically to work with these kids 

289.50 291.17 A: mhm 

290.48 292.96 B: 'cause you know sometimes they distract the class 

293.10 297.19 B: because they they aren't learning or they're f- frustrated 'cause they're not learning 

297.17 309.73 B: and you know you don't want them i was gonna say you've got to keep them isolated but you want to put them in an area where they're not disturbing everyone else and when they get to the area where they are contributing then you go ahead and put them in a classroom setting 

310.15 311.34 A: mhm 

310.26 312.63 B: transition them into the classroom setting 

312.77 314.58 B: and then they can contribute 

315.50 317.13 A: right 

317.73 320.27 A: well that's a good that makes a big difference 

319.97 320.83 B: now 

320.90 331.31 B: um what i was listening to about your uh project i went just come just came from uh dallas and noticed that there was an art um gallery in um one of the malls 

331.14 332.15 A: mhm 

331.51 341.45 B: um dallirea mall as as a matter of fact in in dallas which was something different that i had not ever seen in a mall with an art gallery [mn] 

339.89 340.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

341.22 344.70 A: right well it seems like a lot of um 

345.06 347.88 A: a lot of uh arts 

348.29 352.18 A: well i guess you know the art gallery stores 

352.43 355.35 A: uh are around you know most of the malls 

355.50 359.66 A: have something like that but um not really a um 

360.98 367.76 A: you know um like for instance not far from where i live there's a a little um art gallery 

368.13 371.71 A: that um also does framing and things like that so 

372.21 380.74 A: um but they have they have some [noise] nice um [sigh] nice prints for that or um 

380.97 385.42 A: [noise] you know oil paintings or acrylics that uh a lot of people would 

385.87 390.04 A: would go in and um [noise] you know spend time looking at and hopefully buy 

391.01 396.59 A: but i you know the difference with my [noise] with my approach would be that it would be a um [lipsmack] 

397.27 400.73 A: you know it would it would be kinda a high tech 

400.48 401.40 B: uh-huh 

401.19 405.62 A: um gallery that would deal with some interactive 

406.04 413.18 A: exhibits and i 'cause i think it's kind of an up and coming area in um in the art world something that 

413.30 414.55 A: you know you can 

414.99 419.97 A: in- instead of just looking at it it's it's something that would interact with you and 

420.26 421.12 A: (( you know )) 

421.47 424.00 A: different technologies are being developed that 

424.22 428.66 A: can sense your your mood can um you know 

429.60 434.70 A: you know have some artificial intelligence programming built in that would actually do um 

434.91 436.88 A: different things based upon 

437.06 441.13 A: you know what you just said to it or how you moved or 

441.23 442.21 A: um 

442.48 445.43 A: you know the time of day those sorts of things 

444.79 454.04 B: mhm now would it be something that a technology that you al- already have to know or you have to um learn it as you go through this interactive thing 

454.39 457.58 A: [lipsmack] well no i think um 

458.09 460.39 A: like like any technology 

460.41 466.17 A: it should be available to anybody that that sees it it doesn't have to be 

466.28 467.32 A: um 

467.51 470.60 A: doesn't have to work better for somebody that knows how to use it 

470.61 480.23 A: but by the same token you know it it might come with some instructions on you know how the tap into some more of its capabilities as opposed to 

480.39 482.62 A: just trying to find out what it is 

482.88 486.74 A: [lipsmack] on your own you know like they have different computer games now that 

486.83 489.29 A: um you know some 

489.64 493.66 A: they they don't offer you a a lot of instructions 

493.79 498.68 A: and part of the fun of the game is to you know discover all the things that it offers 

498.87 507.80 A: but um so i see the art in having some of that capability but also the the um you know for the people that aren't aren't 

507.89 509.75 A: really interested in um 

510.06 514.95 A: you know discovering things and you know quite frankly there might be things they would never discover 

515.42 519.86 A: that they wouldn't think of interacting with it a certain way or or um 

520.53 522.40 A: you know using it a certain way 

523.75 526.81 A: and you know it could be anything from um 

527.28 533.30 A: something that looks like a sculpture to something that might be more of a [lipsmack] 

533.83 536.93 A: um you know like a computer display with 

537.03 539.48 A: uh interactive graphics 

539.71 543.92 A: with that has a sensor and a camera and other things 

544.96 548.67 B: mhm mhm mhm now for instance if i want was interested in like um color 

548.52 549.53 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

548.92 552.42 B: and want to know what color makes another color 

552.37 553.74 A: mhm 

553.04 558.55 B: a color [laughter] you would have something like that showing that interactive something 

554.31 555.20 A: right 

557.07 558.18 A: yeah 

558.45 566.39 A: well i mean that that sounds like more an educational kind of program but i think you know the the interactive nature of it is 

566.49 568.24 A: is something that um 

569.03 577.46 A: you know maybe what what this would be would not necessarily show you what you know what colors or what um 

578.58 585.68 A: [sigh] you know what hues make up particular color but you know you might have a capability to to change the colors 

585.72 589.35 A: in an artwork or a a sculpture or something 

587.01 587.85 B: (( okay mhm )) 

589.45 591.71 A: in order to um 

592.47 594.26 A: [lipsmack] you know in order to 

594.33 598.16 A: change it to better meet your needs and then maybe 

598.77 599.95 A: it would have a voice
