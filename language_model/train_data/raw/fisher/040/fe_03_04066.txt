59.62 69.63 B: in a a g- you know a regular job on and off different places for th- the last ten years and i don't really work well in a corporate american environment either so 

66.44 67.26 A: uh-huh 

68.82 71.06 A: i understand [laughter] 

69.72 74.97 B: yeah it's it's tough though like my big thing is i don't really have a lot of um 

75.44 86.99 B: i guess i don't have a lot of real business savvy i don't mean to sell myself short but i'm better at like doing the work it's like the sales stuff like getting the business is the tough part for me 

78.59 79.61 A: mhm 

82.13 83.30 A: right 

86.56 90.25 A: uh-huh you like asking for money [laughter] 

87.13 88.02 B: so 

89.32 94.35 B: yeah yeah ah buy my work you know stuff like that i have a handful of clients but 

91.77 92.90 A: yeah 

94.43 102.12 B: you know i i'd like to get more i'd like to actually save some money or be able to buy stuff and things like that i'm just kinda maintaining right now but 

98.90 99.85 A: right 

101.77 102.73 A: yeah 

102.18 104.27 B: (( ah you know there are worse things in the world )) 

104.16 113.71 A: i i suppose that the most difficult part would be to to actually set it up initially it's like you know for for everything that's gonna come afterwards 

113.40 114.97 B: right right 

114.63 119.65 A: financial planning and business plans drawing all of that stuff up 

119.57 121.33 B: what was your major in college 

120.11 120.82 A: (( but )) 

121.36 129.50 A: ah comparative religion but right [laughter] right now i'm i'm my career track is wilderness leadership so i suppose 

123.01 123.82 B: oh 

128.20 129.70 B: oh that's kinda cool 

129.52 135.39 A: yeah i suppose that opening my own business doing wilderness expeditions would be interesting 

134.99 140.24 B: yeah i wonder how you'd go about that maybe you could just start up by advertising and 

139.51 147.45 A: yeah well i'm al- i'm also getting myself involved in a number of organizations and leading for them so i can see how they work 

147.22 154.74 B: oh that's good you learn a little bit that way and i guess maybe once you make a couple of connections with people maybe word of mouth is a good way to get going too 

148.18 149.41 A: yeah 

154.20 161.48 A: yeah but a lot a lot in that business is about money i'm sure in most businesses that's the case but like 

161.43 169.32 A: glossy brochures and fancy catalogues typically draw the the people who are willing to pay the amount of money that it costs 

164.63 165.64 B: right 

169.25 170.39 B: right 

169.54 171.74 A: to go on such an expedition so 

171.52 173.45 B: where would you look to um 

173.53 178.44 B: to to s- you know run your expeditions like what part of the world or s- ah country 

178.16 190.29 A: um i'm not sure i i mean i've done a lot of travelling so i think ideally i'd like to eventually ah make it to nepal to do a lot of expeditions there 'cause i i lived there for about six months 

190.54 195.34 A: and i would love to to do some sort of leadership stuff there 

195.05 196.38 B: that's pretty cool 

196.08 199.23 A: yeah [laughter] that's through in my 

199.25 202.64 A: you know ideal world [laughter] 

201.50 209.52 B: yeah yeah now i wonder if you'd take ah westerners or americans or if you could encourage you know the people in that area 

208.60 211.38 A: yeah yeah that 

209.90 211.51 B: to go on your tours 

211.60 213.72 A: would be that would be fantastic 

213.16 221.64 B: so that would be like your ultimate dream would you start like smaller would you say ah give tours through canyon country in the states like in utah or something 

220.74 226.52 A: oh yeah i'd i'd start small [laughter] definitely [laughter] 

222.41 224.25 B: yeah [laughter] 

225.22 237.95 B: that's cool i actually worked on a couple of tour guides for ah a book publisher out there who yeah it for people not so much in in your situation but for people like in who want to take those jeep tours and stuff like that 

230.31 231.38 A: oh really 

236.78 237.61 A: uh-huh 

237.98 240.22 B: now would you be interested in that at all or 

240.21 246.38 A: i don't know i'm i'm open to all possibilities [laughter] you did a graphic design for them or 

242.78 244.32 B: yeah 

246.10 253.65 B: it was more kinda boring typesetting for the most part but i guess you say light graphic art like i placed the photos and put the captions and stuff 

250.00 250.78 A: uh-huh 

252.29 253.01 A: (( okay )) 

253.26 255.76 A: is that the kind of stuff that you do now is 

255.85 268.33 B: yeah pretty much and i i write for um for a publication every other month and it works out i was a newspaper reporter when i got out of college and i just didn't like that kinda grind but i think it made me you know 

256.01 256.64 A: (( ah )) 

257.05 258.18 A: (( brochures )) 

264.56 265.54 A: (( oh cool ))

282.46 283.23 A: uh-huh 

288.06 293.61 A: yeah how did that work out doing freelance stuff 'cause i've been thinking about that myself [laughter] 

292.68 304.65 B: that actually it was pretty cool other than that i had no benefits and stuff like that but i don't know when you're in your early twenties and if you're healthy and stuff like that and you're willing to take a couple of risks you know i think it's okay

300.03 301.24 A: yeah 

302.81 304.04 A: right

308.70 323.46 B: you know their framework like i had to cover this meeting or that meeting or this parade or that parade or whatever but it was kind of cool like you'd get back and it was like this surge of energy to get your story written before the deadline and then it was kinda cool rewarding to see it in the paper the next day 

310.14 311.26 A: right 

313.48 315.03 A: right right 

321.64 322.81 A: (( yeah ))
