16.44 17.61 B: [laughter] 

17.42 19.28 A: [cough] there are um 

19.31 21.25 A: in some ways i 

21.31 24.82 A: would like to do that i mean i would do that but uh 

25.91 29.36 A: i have shared custody of kids and stuff like that so 

27.70 28.77 B: oh 

29.21 31.31 B: well maybe you could take them with you 

30.00 33.62 A: i probably would not [laughter] 

31.67 34.10 B: yeah what if you could take them with you 

34.95 38.36 A: i there's a good chance i would 

37.70 38.54 B: yeah 

38.79 47.03 A: i've traveled uh quite a bit i've been to europe a few times and to to south america just a little bit and um 

47.79 52.19 A: there are there are some places that i like that are outside the united states 

51.58 53.75 B: mhm that you think you could live in [laughter] yeah 

53.38 54.78 A: [laughter] 

55.34 59.29 A: if you had enough money you know that you could live well and 

58.34 59.35 B: right 

59.66 65.27 B: well i don't know a million bucks seems like anywhere else w- would go a lot farther than here [laughter] 

64.30 70.35 A: [laughter] yeah well there are a lot of places it would for sure there are some places maybe not but um [lipsmack] 

70.69 75.20 A: now i guess their their premise was that you would never return 

74.70 76.45 B: right exactly 

76.48 78.24 B: and that that would be hard 

77.97 79.90 A: that would be pretty tough if 

80.22 85.60 A: it'd be you know it'd be a lot easier if you could just come back from for vacations or 

84.87 85.98 B: (( yeah right )) 

85.64 89.32 A: sneak back once in a while [laughter] 

86.67 88.24 B: [laughter] 

88.89 91.13 B: well i don't know if that would count though 

91.62 103.39 B: it would seem like you're um almost in one of those uh witness protection programs you know to leave and never come back and you're just basically dropping your life and uh trying to start all over again 

103.17 105.16 A: yeah 

103.70 112.76 B: you know so there goes all family connections and well i guess you could always call and write and what have you but never to see them in person unless they came to see you 

109.92 111.47 A: (( yeah )) 

113.85 116.72 B: so i don't know if i could do that i mean [mn] 

115.64 119.62 A: [sigh] yeah have you have you traveled abroad very much 

119.17 123.57 B: um i've been like uh to south america and i've been to 

123.65 124.63 B: um 

125.06 130.24 B: that's probably it other than within the united states i've traveled within the united states but 

130.19 132.83 A: well did you ever the experience of 

133.33 138.98 A: like growing a broader appreciation of the [laughter] united states to travel outside of the country you have 

136.43 138.05 B: oh absolutely 

138.34 140.75 B: absolutely i went to brazil 

140.88 143.52 B: and i'm like wow [laughter] 

143.07 144.08 A: [laughter] 

143.63 146.72 B: i i feel so rich you know [laughter] 

146.04 147.97 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

146.94 152.79 B: so i you know but i mean they don't know the difference do you know what i'm saying we we just take so much for granted 

152.94 162.78 B: and and they they you know they they probably don't see themselves as poor 'cause they they have you know happiness and stuff and and maybe that's just all they need 

162.79 165.36 B: i i mean that's just what i thought [laughter] 

165.89 170.53 B: but i don't know maybe we'd have to ask them to see what they really thought about their their um 

171.58 175.01 B: their level of finances and their financial status i guess 

175.54 177.15 A: yeah when were you there 

177.02 178.82 B: um probably 

179.26 182.24 B: like over a decade ago gee whiz 

182.67 183.59 B: yeah 

182.83 187.20 A: yeah things i think have gotten worse down there in the last few years too 

186.39 190.46 B: [laughter] i don't know how they could they seem to be dirt poor already 

188.16 188.86 A: (( [mn] )) 

191.34 198.05 B: but a million bucks to go live someplace else and never come back i i just don't see i don't think i could do it 

198.18 200.54 B: i would have to take all my family [laughter] 

200.21 201.71 A: yeah huh 

201.35 207.30 B: i'm talking brothers and sisters and moms and dads and you know nephews and i just i don't think i could do it 

207.81 213.11 B: a million bucks would not be enough to to to buy my way out of this country 

212.91 226.36 A: well what if you weren't too far like just went a little way south of the border on the mexican coast you know where you have nice beaches and stuff and then it wouldn't be uh too expensive for people to come down there 

226.31 230.81 A: if you had a nice place and a million dollars would go a long way down in mexico 

230.45 234.70 B: that's true that's true but the lifestyles are so different down there 

234.64 235.94 A: yeah 

235.05 239.75 B: um i mean just it's it's a totally different way of life i've been to mexico quite a bit 

239.78 245.54 B: and [mn] it's just such a different lifestyle you know i mean crossing the border 

245.79 248.49 B: it's it's kinda like a twilight zone transition 

248.13 249.29 A: yeah 

248.57 255.83 B: you know it really is and i just don't think that a million bucks would do it for me maybe a billion [laughter] 

254.34 255.64 A: [laughter] 

255.86 269.11 A: you know that's kind- that's been kinda my experience too and even in going to places where um like i've been to germany and to france and where the standard of living is is comparable and everything but the uh 

256.05 256.94 B: (( i don't )) 

263.59 264.50 B: mhm 

266.80 267.76 B: is it mhm 

270.39 272.21 A: the culture is 

272.37 275.47 A: different enough you know that uh 

275.64 279.53 A: it's not entirely comfortable you know 

277.15 278.16 B: it would be hu- 

278.54 280.60 B: right it would be a huge adjustment 

280.20 281.76 A: yeah 

281.01 283.88 B: i i can only imagine i've never been to europe 

283.90 288.36 B: but i can just totally imagine i've i've housed um foreign exchange students 

288.63 295.22 B: and you know they they seem to have a hard time you know with the adjustments well this is what i do at home 

295.28 298.26 B: well that's not what we do here you know [laughter] 

297.08 298.25 A: yeah huh 

298.31 305.94 B: so it's i mean it's it's interesting to see just the differences um but i mean it would really be a huge life adjustment 

307.92 308.48 B: (( [mn] )) 

308.62 310.02 B: germany gosh 

311.37 312.57 B: (( [sigh] )) 

312.10 316.86 A: so how can we get that million and not go [laughter] 

314.47 320.43 B: [laughter] i would actually just like to drive on the auto bahn for a few a few days 

321.95 324.42 B: but still a million bucks wouldn't cut it 

325.57 328.96 B: if they gave me a billion maybe i might consider it a 

325.57 326.71 A: yeah 

327.95 329.81 A: [laughter] 

329.13 330.53 B: little bit more 

330.31 332.85 A: they'll have to increase the ante a little bit huh 

332.06 333.73 B: that's right that's right it's 

334.01 335.18 B: (( just argh )) 

335.25 336.04 A: mm 

335.70 337.92 B: i don't see a million bucks doing it 

337.51 341.38 A: yeah if it if it was uh a few million then 

341.48 349.01 A: you could feel more secure about you know being able to constantly bring a stream of people over that you like that sort of thing yeah 

343.04 344.09 B: right 

346.66 347.80 B: right 

348.10 349.93 B: that's true that's true 

350.05 354.51 B: but but it it comes down to your life so our and you know my life 

354.80 363.91 B: would would make the huge change you know and and seeing people visiting p- you know people coming to visit and what have you just isn't the same as living 

363.94 366.01 B: you know in in the u._s. 

366.50 368.10 B: (( you know it's really )) 

368.36 374.46 B: we really have so much freedom and and our i mean our country's so wealthy period 

374.67 381.32 B: you know and i'm not talking just financially wealthy just you know the mix of people the the cultures the 

381.38 383.07 B: there's just so much 

383.11 387.04 B: and and i don't think it's the same anywhere else in in the world 

388.50 390.23 B: (( i don't know what do you think mhm )) 

391.27 394.55 A: well i agree that you know we're 

394.61 401.13 A: we're unique other places are are unique but i mean there are a lot of ex patriots you know that uh 

402.31 406.63 A: left the united states there's things they they didn't [lipsmack] like it here you know 

406.69 414.44 A: charlie chaplin you know they've been some famous m- musicians you know jazz artists and different folks that have uh 

410.45 411.27 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

415.01 416.03 A: felt 

416.57 422.04 A: not welcome here you know yeah yeah there's there's a few different uh 

418.65 419.90 B: really 

422.07 423.53 A: uh 

423.77 435.71 A: like black actors and jazz musicians you know that found other places like france in particular you know that were less racist you know this was some years back but uh 

432.37 433.58 B: really 

434.32 436.54 B: mhm well i can see that [mn] 

436.56 440.15 B: i mean i think i think that issue has gotten a little bit better 

439.94 440.92 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

440.38 443.96 B: um but it's definitely still alive like 

444.87 451.26 B: um but i i really had no idea that there's you know that f- france for instance would be less racist 

451.40 453.63 B: than the u._s. for instance 

453.47 464.74 A: yeah well that certainly was the case but you know that's changing a little bit too now uh the france went through that situation uh about a year ago i guess where they had that election and that right wing 

464.59 469.55 A: anti immigration guy got into the run offs and i think that uh 

471.02 476.86 A: the french were kind of embarrassed about the whole thing that [laughter] that could come up in their country 

476.90 477.98 B: really 

477.04 479.69 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

478.25 480.33 B: i i had no idea you know 

480.92 482.88 B: i don't watch the news a whole lot [laughter] 

483.04 486.21 A: yeah well as you know we 

486.32 500.01 A: we're such a melting pot and i think we've we've we've kind of discriminated against each group [laughter] as they've arrived but made them welcome at the same time you know if people had been able to to generally uh uh 

488.01 489.32 B: exactly 

495.58 496.53 B: right 

500.05 507.82 A: achieve their dreams here you know whether they've they've been the irish or the italians or you know whoev- whatever wave current wave it was 

501.78 503.00 B: right 

508.02 509.17 A: um 

509.67 524.31 A: and some of the uh a few of the european countries i think they didn't have the streams of immigration quite as much but they have more in recent history and there's some backlash to it the the elections in france showed that and then 

517.58 518.40 B: (( mm yeah )) 

524.42 535.49 A: in england the first time i went to england i was really surprised you know england having all those colonies they had a lot of people that came from the colonies you know so they have lots of like indians for example 

531.78 532.67 B: uh-huh 

535.21 536.29 B: really 

535.91 549.19 A: yeah so when i when i went to england uh the first time it was like all right i'm going to england i'm going to have some fish and chips you know and then i go looking around it's like there is no fish and chips places they're all kebabs you know 

542.77 544.61 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

549.23 553.40 A: (( [laughter] like i don't get it )) 

551.01 552.46 B: how funny 

552.67 558.04 B: how funny but i i really don't think any other place is is quite the melting pot that the u._s. is 

557.97 561.61 A: no well certainly not in california [laughter] 

559.83 561.26 B: (( [laughter] )) 

561.42 564.05 B: that's true i think all the um 

563.66 565.46 A: so where are you from anyway 

564.75 566.36 B: i'm in california [laughter] 

565.68 567.97 A: oh okay i'm in california so [mn]

578.84 579.66 A: (( ah )) 

579.66 580.62 B: [laughter] 

581.06 582.08 B: so yeah 

582.36 586.41 B: a million bucks i don't think would be quite enough to get me to 

586.54 588.48 B: to uproot 

588.66 592.74 B: i mean literally uproot and and and move someplace else 

588.79 589.60 A: (( yeah )) 

591.99 597.32 A: yeah probably not for me either but you know if they raised the offer [laughter] i might consider it 

596.01 599.89 B: right exactly exactly they'd have to significantly raise it to to
