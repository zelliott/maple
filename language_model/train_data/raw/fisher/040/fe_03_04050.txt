3.70 5.35 B: hi i'm cathy 

5.09 5.96 A: hi 

5.98 7.26 B: hi melissa 

7.42 8.63 B: did you want to begin 

8.52 9.36 A: (( sure )) 

9.18 10.02 B: okay 

10.01 13.37 A: ah the type of business i would open 

13.84 19.69 A: [lipsmack] probably be a service business maybe in babysitting dogs in people's homes 

20.36 26.17 A: um something like that where you can make you know less time but good money 

26.87 36.55 B: you know i was thinking about the same thing actually something to do with animals i have a dog ah that i love dearly and i love all animals i love going to dog parks i love 

28.64 29.48 A: (( huh )) 

36.69 41.35 B: you know visiting breeders i i don't think i'd wanna be a breeder but [cough] [lipsmack] 

38.40 39.87 A: (( right )) 

41.72 52.86 B: probably something in the dog industry i know a lot of ah businesses here i'm in portland oregon have begun with doggy day care and i thought that would be really fun to do 

50.23 51.81 A: mhm 

53.17 62.37 A: yeah we've seen services where they're called doggy baby sitters and i don't know about you but when we leave we don't put her in a kennel i put her we ask somebody to watch her 

62.02 63.42 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

62.70 70.73 A: and there's professional services where you can start your business and they charge up to fifty dollars a day or more 

69.57 70.85 B: oh my goodness 

71.10 79.77 A: and you know you you offer them to come in twice a day and you know feed the dog walk the dog um 

79.72 91.16 A: and then if they want more like if they want you to spend the night then that's extra you know if it's far away that's extra or however you want to run it i don't know if i would do all that but some people do 

84.39 85.72 B: mhm mhm 

90.94 92.21 B: yeah 

91.51 96.56 A: and that's a good way to help out people 'cause i don't putting dogs in kennels 

96.01 102.84 B: i don't either i don't either and i love i love dogs and actually i'm losing my job at the end of june so 

102.58 104.03 A: really 

103.49 110.71 B: but you know it's something that i've considered but i just don't think i have the capital to put up any money right at this point in time 

109.61 117.49 A: right because you have to advertise and live off for yourself [laughter] [laughter] until it gets going 

115.08 116.69 B: right 

117.18 121.33 B: and i don't know about where you are but there's just a glut of of dog 

121.36 129.47 B: type services here in portland so i just don't know how well it would go over at this point you know 'cause there's so much competition but 

123.31 124.74 A: oh really 

128.52 130.08 A: do you like grooming 

130.09 134.59 A: they also have ah pr- um what is it called mobile groomer 

134.66 148.00 B: oh yeah yeah i thought about that now i do have a i have a schnauzer and she does need grooming i haven't tried it myself yet but um i know that i pay about twenty five dollars every other month to have her groomed 

139.89 140.80 A: uh-huh 

147.84 153.22 A: right my husband went into mobile grooming where you have a little van and you bring 'em out to the van 

153.44 157.78 A: and you know you go to their house so the person doesn't have to go out 

155.36 156.25 B: uh-huh 

157.82 162.71 A: and do it right there and so the dog's not there at a place all day 

162.78 168.58 A: and i guess supposedly people pay extra money just for you to come out to their house you know 

167.28 171.44 B: i love that idea yeah that the convenience of it would be great 

168.65 169.51 A: (( you know )) 

171.05 172.52 A: right 

171.50 173.69 B: now how would you wash the dog though 

173.52 184.43 A: it's it's a little van i don't know where he found it but it's a little van like and it has everything in it you know like you said though it's the capital it was like ten or fifteen thousand dollars to buy it all and 

176.39 177.23 B: (( [cough] )) 

184.54 191.14 A: you know but once you start rolling people would probably pay in upwards of fifty depends how rich they are 

190.43 191.89 B: right right 

191.24 195.44 A: you know or more for you to come pamper their dog 

195.58 199.83 A: so it's a good idea but like you said capital i don't know 

198.78 199.81 B: right 

200.11 202.91 A: i don't know who has the money for all that [laughter] 

202.24 207.00 B: but i guess this was the question was actually if if money wasn't an object so 

206.06 207.33 A: oh that's true 

207.08 216.49 B: so like i think i'd do that ah you know i love i love animals i don't know if i'd be a good groomer but i'd love to do something with animals and i know here in portland they have some 

216.34 229.94 B: actually some like play structures inside where animals can go and play it sounds kind of ridiculous but here in portland it rains all the time and the parks get really muddy and you know you're dog's cooped up all winter 

225.31 226.61 A: right 

230.16 239.83 B: and ah i've thought about that too i know there's a place i haven't been to it yet but there's a place maybe ten miles from where i live that charges five dollars for two hours 

239.86 247.44 B: and you go in and and there's just play structures and things for the dogs to do it's little agility runs and 

247.22 261.41 B: and ah they get to interact and socialize with the other dogs and the other adults that are there and you know i i know it sounds silly but it if you're a dog lover it really isn't you know people i know people are willing to pay you know to have their dogs entertained 

251.90 252.96 A: right 

259.48 263.42 A: well people are willing to pay to take their kids to those indoor 

263.59 266.75 A: gym places so [laughter] 

264.88 268.00 B: exactly exactly that's true 

267.48 282.23 A: well i have four kids and i don't pay to go to indoor if it's raining oh well [laughter] but you know it people pay for all kinds of stuff nowadays i think the business to start would be a service business because people pay for anything 

269.75 273.51 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

275.92 277.09 B: that's true 

281.96 283.80 B: that's true that's true 

282.76 287.33 A: those that have the money those of us that don't have the money [laughter] want to start a business 

284.13 285.20 B: that's true 

286.95 300.37 B: [laughter] that's very true you know 'cause people are real busy and involved in their lives and i think they're looking for you know things to make their lives easier and i think they're looking for ways to indulge their their dogs and their you know 

295.33 296.84 A: right 

300.57 305.90 B: children [laughter] so do you have any dogs melissa 

301.57 303.38 A: right [laughter] 

305.46 309.10 A: yes i have one she's a american eskimo dog 

308.34 310.60 B: oh i bet she's gorgeous 

309.49 313.40 A: [noise] yes she sheds but she's she's beautiful 

312.99 314.71 B: yeah yeah 

314.22 321.29 A: yeah and i we thought about grooming because of the way she sheds and we pay thirty dollars to get her 

321.49 326.72 A: groomed and that's the cheapest that is around here in kentucky so 

322.47 323.54 B: oh 

326.75 332.44 B: so does she have to be groomed then or is that just to be bathed and brushed out or 

331.34 337.00 A: [noise] oh no we can do that but we take her to get [noise] professionally clipped and 

337.08 348.65 A: you're not really supposed to clip her as far as a._k._a. or whatever but we clip her because she sheds her winter coat like all summer starting like in march so 

338.73 339.58 B: uh-huh 

349.20 351.80 A: you know we're vacuuming twice a day [laughter] 

351.11 353.83 B: oh yeah oh yeah 

352.18 357.83 A: if we don't clip her so we go ahead and clip her and she doesn't look bad she still looks pretty 

357.29 361.97 B: oh i bet she does now do they clip her short and then it just grows out or 

359.01 359.76 A: so 

361.42 367.37 A: i do it about an inch so it's not too so it's not like a labrador type short but 

366.41 367.37 B: right 

367.61 369.47 A: yeah it's pretty short for her 

369.66 371.83 A: and then and we let it grow all 

372.14 375.73 A: summer so in the fall her winter coat starts coming in 

376.33 377.71 B: (( oh wow )) 

376.54 378.70 A: then she is ready for the winter again 

379.02 381.90 B: and how much do they charge you there to do that 

380.83 382.86 A: thirty bucks 

382.03 382.96 B: wow 

383.06 384.84 A: yeah 

383.69 386.02 B: so you have that done a couple of times a year 

386.03 390.52 A: yeah well we just had it done a month ago so we're gonna have to get it done again 

390.34 391.61 B: wow 

390.77 395.84 A: she's already set in she her hair grows really quick [laughter] 

394.77 396.07 B: how big is she 

396.04 398.64 A: she's only twenty five pounds 

397.37 398.47 B: (( oh okay )) 

398.81 403.95 B: yeah not too b- too big i was expecting a bigger dog [laughter] 

398.91 399.87 A: so 

402.30 404.92 A: no no she's not like um 

405.27 407.11 A: [lipsmack] husky or anything 

406.63 408.19 B: right right 

408.54 412.18 A: she's what they call a standard so she's actually the biggest for her 

412.62 414.24 A: they have little ones 

413.64 414.78 B: oh 

414.38 418.31 A: we got her at a humane society somebody gave her up 

416.49 417.48 B: (( mhm )) 

418.12 419.32 B: oh 

419.14 426.08 A: and so you know she's probably not full blood but that's what she is american eskimo 

425.87 427.11 B: how old is she 

427.31 430.31 A: she's four now ah we think [laughter] 

429.62 431.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

431.25 433.02 B: as well as you can tell 

432.53 433.51 A: right 

433.19 434.27 B: yeah 

434.32 435.76 B: yeah 

436.05 440.34 A: ah yeah we would probably start with animals [noise] just [lipsmack] because it's 

440.53 442.69 A: you know it's needed 

442.49 445.19 B: yeah it i think it is i think people 

445.25 451.10 B: are really attached to their dogs and willing to spend extra money to have them 

446.43 448.34 A: [noise] 

452.24 455.23 B: you know to have extra things for their animals 

454.56 456.43 A: yeah 

455.63 467.25 B: i don't have any extra money or [laughter] but i know that i love my dog and you know that she's a big part of of my son and my life and you know we're willing to give her little extras as we can 

457.62 459.59 A: (( no [noise] )) 

467.59 470.46 B: 'cause she's been you know a great great dog 

467.75 468.89 A: yeah 

470.54 472.04 A: oh 

471.52 472.31 B: (( [laughter] )) 

472.73 476.01 A: yeah we she barks a lot but that's okay 

475.70 478.64 B: [laughter] is she protective 

477.98 486.09 A: she she's a barker and she will run after other dogs like she ran after two pit bulls that came in the front yard 

485.68 487.25 B: oh my goodness 

486.60 492.69 A: but when it comes to men and other people she'll bark but she'll back up while she's barking you know 

492.30 493.82 B: right right 

492.97 503.77 A: but so she'll never attack a person [laughter] but and with the four kids when they were little you know they would grab on her and she never once nipped at 'em or anything 

494.37 496.92 B: [laughter] 

503.41 506.74 B: oh that's great so your are your children real young or 

506.73 509.12 A: three five seven and nine

523.35 530.89 B: yeah yeah i would i would agree teenagers are not a lot of fun they seem to know everything or they think they do 

524.12 526.20 A: [laughter] 

527.34 529.13 A: [laughter] 

530.56 537.76 A: right and then i'll have four of 'em and they already fight now the closest ones fight you know the two years apart 

531.30 532.18 B: but 

537.40 539.51 B: do you have both boys and girls or

569.69 576.78 A: the seven and nine fight the nine and seven and five fight and the five and three fight but the others all get along 

571.11 571.99 B: right 

576.64 578.46 B: well that kind of makes sense 

577.82 579.39 A: [laughter] 

578.51 584.08 B: they're competition with each other probably a little bit and yeah yeah yes yes i am
