1.93 3.67 A: (( hi my name is helen )) 

3.45 4.46 B: mm 

4.67 6.54 B: [lipsmack] hi my name is james [mn] 

7.25 8.28 B: how're you 

8.43 9.41 A: okay 

9.12 13.67 B: good so we're supposed to talk about um 

13.82 17.08 B: whether we'd commit perjury for a friend or family member 

16.98 18.25 A: mhm 

18.43 23.11 B: all right well what do you think about that 

22.74 23.65 A: (( well )) 

25.68 37.02 A: i don't know perjury on the witness stand i guess it would be hard i would be thinking of i'd be worried about the implications for me i don't know if i could commit perjury or plead the fifth 

37.22 39.42 B: right right [mn] 

39.87 50.48 B: yeah i wonder well pleading the fifth that wouldn't ah i don't know if a witness can do that actually this is kinda funny 'cause i have a law degree [laughter] so yeah um 

47.88 50.03 A: [noise] oh [laughter] 

50.47 55.29 B: [cough] but i i don't think y- you can only plead the fifth ah if your 

55.87 59.98 B: rights somehow would be or wait 

61.46 66.13 B: oh gosh oh no y- it's incriminating yourself 

66.45 67.40 B: so 

67.60 72.06 B: you couldn't really you'd be like compelled to to be a witness 

72.32 73.41 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

72.43 73.41 B: you know 

73.98 80.65 A: [noise] so what do you think would it be the degree of um do you think it would matter that it was the degree of the crime 

74.57 75.31 B: [laughter] 

81.06 85.11 B: oh you know what that's an interesting point 'cause um [mn] 

85.97 97.57 B: well [sigh] yeah you remember um the clinton thing right when he he was being sued by paula jones and [mn] and ah well he actually lied himself 

90.23 91.35 A: yeah 

97.54 108.27 B: so it wasn't like somebody lied for him but um a lot of people were saying oh it's just you know it's just a sexual harassment case whatever it's just made up anyway paula jones is just lying 

108.48 120.34 B: um so it was like no big deal but i had just gotten out of law school and ah even though i'm you know relatively liberal politically i just i couldn't ah 

120.85 125.24 B: i didn't see any justification for clinton lying 

125.67 129.64 B: on committing perjury under oath you know um 

130.16 131.61 B: (( just ah )) 

131.77 137.15 B: [lipsmack] [mn] you know be- partly because it was like the democrats and clinton 

137.12 147.14 B: and all his buddies who had pushed through sexual harassment laws in the eighties and here it is coming back to bite him on the butt and they're like oh these law- thi- this stuff is these 

141.77 143.03 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

147.22 150.12 B: these cases are lame you know it's like oh okay 

150.30 153.15 B: now they are [mn] but um [lipsmack] 

153.32 156.00 B: yeah i don't know for myself i 

157.01 167.71 B: [sigh] it would just it would depend on the case situation yeah i mean if it like you say if it was like a murder maybe you know it'd be kinda hard to to lie but if it's like 

167.62 173.39 B: somebody suing your friend and it's a bogus case or something like that i don't know 

173.59 175.55 A: [lipsmack] do you think it would be different 

176.08 176.88 A: (( um )) 

176.94 181.31 A: like a friend like i have two kids or like your children 

181.68 182.77 B: right 

181.75 182.71 A: or just 

183.04 185.41 B: right you know yeah i 

185.52 192.30 B: i think it's you know um [cough] i don't know about like outright lying but i'd definitely try to [mn] 

192.51 195.99 B: i could see situations where i might try to 

196.10 200.70 B: shade the truth so that it benefits persons close to me you know 

201.50 204.27 A: (( because one i saw on um [lipsmack] )) 

205.36 215.51 A: television on one scenario and it was this witness and she changed she said that she saw the person but she changed the color of his shirt 

215.74 223.54 A: so that when he was picked up he was picked up like in a black not a red shirt and they said are you sure and they said yes 

218.14 218.93 B: (( mm )) 

224.74 228.13 A: it c- then it came to find out there were two different people 

227.82 228.72 B: ooh 

228.60 234.55 A: in it but she did do the perjury by you know switching the color of his shirt [lipsmack] 

233.91 236.49 B: oh she said it was that guy huh 

236.70 245.28 A: well she said she she saw the person well a description of the person that matched for that night but she said they were wearing a differing color shirt 

244.97 246.39 B: mhm 

245.74 253.48 A: and so when they picked this person up they had a red shirt like instead of the black shirt and they said are you sure and she said yes so she did 

252.13 253.39 B: (( oh i see )) 

253.49 256.45 A: she did commit perjury right 

254.98 256.95 B: but it was the right guy 

258.08 259.16 A: well 

258.96 261.00 B: i mean it was the 

259.57 260.13 A: (( [mn] )) 

260.70 264.97 A: it turned out later that it was you know another guy but um 

264.07 265.53 B: oh really [laughter] 

265.54 274.25 A: yeah so i mean she perjured because she knew and it really wasn't him but she did see him in a red shirt 

266.47 267.27 B: ooh 

273.91 274.93 B: yeah 

274.26 280.63 A: so she changed the i mean she identified but said it was a different shirt 

278.99 286.34 B: that's not cool 'cause cops can like pick up anybody and just 'cause they're picked up by the cops it's like [mn] 

286.96 288.43 B: that poor guy 

288.44 290.99 B: [laughter] oh well i mean yeah 

290.20 292.30 A: so i mean that was like um 

291.94 297.34 B: that wasn't actually perjury though that was like with cops that wasn't like un- under oath 

296.39 298.74 A: yeah it was on the witness stand 

298.05 299.62 B: (( oh )) 

299.01 309.67 A: she said when they she was a witness that saw them running from the the it was beating up someone and they saw 'em running and she said she saw him in a red shirt 

305.46 306.38 B: yeah 

309.52 310.78 B: mhm 

310.08 320.44 A: or whatever the opposite color and when they picked them up right after the scene so this was on the witness stand that she changed the color of the shirt [mn] [mn] 

312.31 313.24 B: right 

316.58 317.72 B: oh wow 

319.94 328.20 B: yeah that's that'd be a hard thing to do just 'cause just just 'cause the cops had picked up some guy walking around [sigh] 

328.56 335.54 B: huh yeah i don't know yeah it's you know it's i suppose it's one thing to protect somebody 

335.22 335.78 A: (( [mn] )) 

335.88 341.37 B: to perjure yourself to protect somebody but to like put an innocent guy in jail that would be 

341.74 344.66 B: i would probably be against that [laughter] 

345.16 346.07 B: (( oh )) 

345.17 352.19 A: oh well they didn't know there was another person she didn't do it naming somebody else she just changed the color of the shirt 

351.66 355.20 B: okay but she thought she had the right guy 

355.41 365.43 A: she thought it was him but she changed the shirt because of you know his school record he was a kid in the neighborhood she couldn't believe that it was him 

359.14 360.34 B: (( yeah right )) 

362.36 363.53 B: (( oh )) 

365.60 371.24 A: but she did you know see him and actually he was running because they had um 

365.77 366.70 B: yeah 

371.90 377.55 A: [lipsmack] ah beat up a friend of his so he was there with somebody else who actually 

373.87 374.83 B: okay 

377.42 378.58 B: sounds pretty 

377.62 378.51 A: (( did it it )) 

378.63 380.40 B: yeah sou- 

379.74 382.25 A: was complicated but i mean it's like [mn] 

381.00 383.56 B: (( sounds complicated yeah )) 

383.02 384.09 A: um 

384.11 388.42 A: you know i you know on the surface i would say well i would never do it 

388.52 391.14 A: but it's just like some the 

388.75 389.55 B: right 

391.25 403.88 A: innuendos and the things that happen these days that you know you find the falsehoods in everything and then you know your family members saying they're gonna go away or you know whatever you would hope that 

401.77 402.69 B: right 

404.07 405.06 B: right 

404.38 411.98 A: you know you raised your kids in the right manner and that this wasn't really true i don't know it kind of would be denial [laughter] [mn] [mn] 

409.29 410.40 B: yeah 

411.57 419.86 B: yeah well the thing is it's like we all know that cops and prosecutors an- and and all those people 

419.74 426.85 B: do lie we know that for a fact and and [mn] why regular folk who aren't 

427.04 435.64 B: cops and and prosecutors why they should be the only ones bound to honesty is doesn't seem fair to me 

435.31 437.46 A: (( oh yeah that's another point [mn] )) 

437.13 444.33 B: yeah you know let's face it i mean the cops don't lie all the time but but they they do and ah 

444.93 455.44 B: make up stuff and what not um you know just because they think they have this big picture in mind well this guy's really probably guilty of something else so you know [sigh] 

455.79 458.89 B: or whatever justification so 

458.88 471.30 B: yeah i don't know come to think of it i- if i were to get embroiled in some case or something like that knowing that you know so many prosecutions just just degenerate into 

471.46 478.96 B: um like you said innuendos falsehoods you know half truths and stuff like that i would probably just do what 

479.51 483.05 B: i'd be probably as dirty as everybody else you know 

483.11 490.12 B: and just try to try to work the system to my friend's benefit or my family member's benefit 

490.92 491.48 B: (( [cough] )) 

491.78 498.17 A: well how would you do you think you would tell if um one of your witnesses were [mn] committing perjury 

498.54 504.41 B: oh yeah like if i were on trial or something and somebody was lying for me 

503.63 504.99 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

505.31 520.06 B: well i don't know like again that would probably depend on the situation if i've gotten to the point where i'm at trial and i haven't like pleaded out pleaded guilty to some lesser offence or whatever and just gone on my way if i'm pr- contesting it 

520.45 527.04 B: then you know it i might be in a desperate situation so i might just you know 

527.67 529.21 B: just kinda hope 

529.46 533.28 B: you know and again ah i guess i i come back to this thing where 

533.46 543.09 B: you know if like hypothetically if i were on trial i would know that the pro- you know invariably or in a lot of cases at least the prosecution just does whatever it ta- 

543.84 551.85 B: does whatever it can do to convict and [mn] i don't know sometimes you do have to get kinda down and dirty and start um 

552.62 559.43 B: you know start playing rough and i don't know i think maybe i i probably wouldn't do anything 

559.44 560.49 B: i mean 

560.62 570.75 B: you know this is just all i of course i hope private [laughter] this conversation but you know and it's hypothetical so i don't know i i'm not sure but um 

563.81 565.52 A: (( [noise] yeah ah )) 

571.26 575.71 B: [mn] that's a tough one how about you would you stop ah a friend from lying for you 

577.66 583.71 A: oh [laughter] i don't know i guess i'd rath- you know [mn] 

584.62 586.53 A: i don't know if i would [mn] 

587.72 591.00 A: i would just hope i wouldn't be in that place 

590.56 591.64 B: yeah 

591.18 596.97 A: [laughter] it's and if i were 

592.87 593.64 B: (( [laughter] )) 

593.74 595.11 B: i know what you mean 

596.98 597.72 B: (( [cough] )) 

597.11 599.95 A: i guess i wouldn't advise them to if i
