0.13 1.42 A: (( hello )) 

0.77 3.27 B: [lipsmack] hello my name is evelyn 

3.06 5.11 A: hi my name is marshall 

4.80 6.99 B: and i live in brooklyn new york 

6.46 8.97 A: huh i'm in long island i'm in north abalone 

8.72 13.12 B: oh good that's not very far now we have to discuss businesses 

12.71 13.95 A: [mn] okay 

13.35 16.11 B: have you had a business or you've ever been in business 

15.30 21.63 A: uh actually yes i started my own i'm in i'm my regular job is uh with news day 

21.47 25.36 B: mhm [lipsmack] oh that's interesting 

21.64 28.10 A: i'm a i'm a writer [cough] and i started my own and i tried to start my own monthly publication 

27.21 29.20 B: that would be nice 

28.52 29.98 A: yeah but um 

30.50 33.64 A: [lipsmack] some of the problems is you know is uh 

33.78 42.10 A: with a publication you need advertising revenue and yeah so you need money up up you need start up cash or you 

36.29 38.14 B: yes you need a lotta money 

42.82 46.11 A: have to generate the revenue and 

45.05 46.36 B: [lipsmack] i see 

46.41 51.72 B: well i never thought about starting a business but since i'm a refunder i would start something with 

51.80 60.33 B: uh sample items selling sample items at half price getting them free through an eight hundred number and have you ever done anything like that [noise] well 

59.71 62.27 A: um no not really 

61.44 66.98 B: that's what i would think of and also ladies sportswear which i think is a good item to start a business with 

66.35 67.94 A: yeah 

67.35 73.52 B: but uh it's not easy because you have to have a big cash outlay you have to have a place of residence or 

73.56 78.67 B: store or an office or whatever so uh i kept thinking about it but there's 

74.61 76.04 A: right exactly 

77.78 80.08 A: yeah it's overhead that you have to worry about 

79.60 81.69 B: right and you know how many businesses 

80.69 85.56 A: but this but i think they said on the recording just now that if if money was not an issue 

84.84 86.79 B: oh right that's true 

85.68 90.43 A: yeah so if you were able to start it you would just be able to get a store and uh 

89.93 91.38 B: [lipsmack] [mn] right 

90.67 93.27 A: and build up your inventory 

92.82 96.90 B: [lipsmack] but you know how many businesses fail more than half fail 

95.41 99.66 A: oh yeah well the economy plays a major factor especially right now 

99.10 102.01 B: (( right now things are very bad soon you'll have to forego )) 

100.83 106.25 A: yeah and right now and then the other thing you have to face is um is the large retailers 

103.50 105.14 B: yeah 

106.21 113.92 B: right and i'm sure macy's and uh the others will compete so i was thinking of sample items like cute you know 

106.38 108.57 A: (( but um )) 

109.02 109.94 A: yeah 

113.91 123.04 B: sample sizes of make up shampoo uh food items but uh it's hard to get that because where do ya get all of these sample items 

117.90 119.63 A: right 

122.40 129.38 A: yeah plus you have to get 'em through the manufacturer 'cause they they use 'em more for promotion of their products 

125.35 126.32 B: right 

129.05 134.40 B: and then sometimes i'm sure your stores have triple coupons do you have that so you can buy these 

132.73 136.46 A: yeah they come once in a while most of the time it's double 

134.45 138.88 B: so you can get these so you can get these things free and then sell them 

137.55 138.40 A: yeah 

138.75 140.56 A: right 

139.28 142.50 B: (( and uh you can do it outta your own home actually )) 

141.87 142.68 A: true 

142.90 145.78 B: so maybe that's something to be thinking of 

145.18 154.70 A: yeah i would think i was actually thinking yesterday we were talking as we driving uh there's a building that used to be a roller skating rink and 

152.53 155.33 B: in north abalone i'm not familiar with that mhm 

154.73 160.96 A: um it's it's in this one is in bay shore so it used to be a roller skating rink and they closed it down about two years ago 

160.58 161.61 B: (( yeah [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

160.97 164.63 A: and i was thinking i mean right now 

164.42 178.31 A: physical fitness is a big deal and they're talking about how children are are overweight and out of shape and and i would think that i was actually talking with my fiance about how that would be a perfect place to put in like a roller hockey 

169.40 171.12 B: yeah very true 

178.15 180.54 A: deck hockey type of arena 

180.04 182.43 B: that's a good idea i never thought of that [noise] [noise] 

180.88 186.05 A: because it's already established and you would just have to re- rebuild it but um 

186.35 192.27 A: it would just need refurbishing but then you know she was mentioning that the biggest thing in that in that type of business is the insurance 

191.93 199.18 B: oh yes yes that's true and also thinking of tai chi or yo- um not yoga what do they call it tai chi 

192.82 193.99 A: but uh 

194.08 195.05 A: (( i was )) 

198.95 201.62 A: (( um yeah jujitsu karate )) 

199.31 200.17 B: um 

200.95 213.01 B: yes karate karate 'cause my son used to take karate lessons there's non overhead involved there just having a large large with padded walls padded ceiling get a japanese guy to teach and you're in business 

206.45 208.75 A: [mn] true you just need a yeah 

212.43 214.18 A: yeah 

213.22 215.10 B: that's one possibility 

214.22 218.98 A: but you probably i think i would think insurance and that is probably very important too 'cause 

218.37 219.86 B: because you have children 

219.46 221.87 A: yeah plus and and plus the 

221.92 225.97 A: the moves and that are fairly dangerous from what i you know 

225.50 232.85 B: well my son took it so i know it's not that bad but uh you're right well they have padded floors padded walls you know and mirrors 

226.98 228.50 A: yeah 

230.49 238.15 A: right but the contact that's that's made is i mean you know depending on you have to have a very well educated teacher 

234.57 235.83 B: can be dangerous 

238.00 243.43 B: well it's like japanese guys were teaching that but i'm afraid the insurance would too high you're right 

239.86 241.60 A: yeah 

242.61 244.34 A: yeah 

243.50 246.94 B: so what kinda possibilities [laughter] are left for a business 

247.07 250.93 B: you have to get something novel something that nobody has thought of before 

250.43 259.29 A: [mn] i think the best business to go into right now is something that people need like a like a need type of business like a pharmacy um 

254.42 255.28 B: oh what 

256.34 257.57 B: (( yeah well what )) 

258.03 261.98 B: [lipsmack] yeah but then you have as you say you're facing k. mart and wool mart and [lipsmack] 

261.21 266.83 A: true but like here there's there's a store 'round the corner from my house is a a genevieve owned by 

265.86 268.16 B: yes yes we have it too 

266.95 277.96 A: and they just rebuilt the entire store and the pharmacy the quality in the pharmacy is is really bad and the service has gone way down hill they 

269.27 270.29 B: yeah 

274.70 276.00 B: oh yes 

278.27 286.19 A: they if you call in your prescription it- they'll tell you it's ready in like two to three hours and it's not ready for like six seven hours sometimes the next day 

284.02 286.00 B: (( oh we don't have that well )) 

286.20 294.71 A: so i mean no matter what business you go into you really have to realize that you're you know the customers are are you need the customers 

288.88 290.22 B: (( is become proficient )) 

294.11 303.33 B: i think what you have to get is something that's novel that has not been done before i was thinking of a candy gram but that's not a business actually candy grams you know you call up 

301.03 302.01 A: true 

302.40 304.26 A: yeah 

303.19 309.97 B: i know people on diets that are desperately hungry if they don't have candy in the house they will call for a candy gram to deliver to themselves 

306.45 307.01 A: (( [mn] )) 

309.37 321.41 A: well that's not a good thing then 'cause like i i myself had gastric bypass surgery and i shouldn't be eating it and huh you know if i know that it's accessible i i don't think i would want it [laughter] but i mean you 

314.77 316.54 B: (( no [laughter] )) 

319.10 321.21 B: (( yeah that's true too and of people who have )) 

321.63 324.59 B: bypass surgery that's something i've never heard of but that's 

324.02 326.12 A: yeah it's where you have your stomach stapled 

326.09 329.82 B: oh for overweight oh forget it that's not for you [laughter] 

327.29 328.48 A: yeah 

329.13 330.58 A: no not at all 

330.14 341.79 B: but i know somebody who was on weight watchers and didn't like to keep candy in the house and what she did was sent a candy gram to herself from her parents and she took it and she ate the whole pound up 

333.89 334.99 A: right 

338.59 340.56 A: [laughter] 

341.22 343.66 A: no that's not good that's defeating her purpose 

342.13 343.02 B: oh that 

343.29 349.00 B: of course so oh your having your the stapling that's um i know what you know so we have to skip that 

344.04 344.90 A: yeah 

348.17 358.84 A: well like in my in my type of thing i mean i'm sitting here with um little kinds of nutritional stuff and it's in front of me and you can never find the type that i mean there's there's a 

354.22 355.18 B: yeah 

358.99 365.48 A: it's another thing like in my gym that i go to they just opened up a facility that that has uh 

361.60 362.36 B: yeah 

365.50 372.14 A: sportswear and nutritional supplements and um i mean i'm i'm in need of taking protein supplements 

367.50 368.69 B: (( [mn] that's good [lipsmack] )) 

371.99 382.62 A: and to find the ones that are any good is very hard and everybody that i know that's had the surgery that's going through the support has trouble finding the supplements that we need 

380.27 381.51 B: (( that's true )) 

381.95 384.31 B: so you think that might be a good business then 

383.80 393.23 A: um i think it would be maybe not right now but maybe down the road because a lot more people are having the surgery and 

387.69 389.08 B: mhm yeah 

392.10 394.15 B: i thought it was rare [laughter] [lipsmack] 

393.82 401.03 A: no it's getting really popular and coming you know coming into the situation where people need like protein bars 

400.17 402.52 B: what is that for protein bars 

401.91 406.50 A: um well because when you have the surgery you need to have um 

406.75 411.86 A: you have to have so much protein because protein is what makes the rest of your body work 

411.27 414.31 B: oh i see so maybe that's another possibility then [noise] 

413.03 420.21 A: you know and that's like something like you know i mean most of the protein supplements are coated with most of the protein bars i've found are coated with a 

420.40 427.14 A: chocolate substitute and not many people like it and the flavoring i mean they don't taste very well 

420.92 421.87 B: yes 

422.15 423.28 B: oh yes 

425.36 426.13 B: (( no )) 

426.49 427.48 B: well 

427.16 430.65 A: but uh there are a few out there that are pretty good and 

429.72 435.35 B: it might be a good idea for a business also then protein bars and uh t shirts 

431.96 432.70 A: (( yes )) 

434.17 439.39 A: or maybe find a way to manufacture 'em yourself and sell 'em yourself i mean that's that's i mean 

438.34 441.26 B: manufacturing is not that easy though [laughter] 

440.18 444.85 A: no but i mean if if i mean it's all up to the ingredients you know 

442.26 443.49 B: that would go 

444.00 452.49 B: well i would go with sportswear with t shirts and sweat pants and sneakers and visors and things like that sun visors sunglasses 

448.03 449.28 A: yeah that's 

451.22 457.53 A: well that's that's what they're selling outta the gym in the same place where i i bought the protein bars today they're selling all these things and 

455.57 456.36 B: yeah 

456.73 459.71 B: what's the name of that cob solutions by any chance 

459.40 464.60 A: um yeah one of those i think yeah i mean advantage myoflex yeah 

463.61 469.20 B: [mn] yeah cob solutions are very very sweet over nauseatingly sweet [laughter] 

466.33 468.10 A: yeah 

468.82 470.00 A: yeah 

469.32 474.33 B: so that might be a possibility too health bars sweat shirts t shirts [noise] 

473.30 477.71 A: i mean right now you know i mean people i mean luxury items are pretty much 

477.66 489.40 A: something that people aren't purchasing anymore right now with the economy the way it is and maybe you know i mean people would are more conscious i mean my gym gets is getting more and more crowded 

481.35 483.35 B: (( yes that's true )) 

486.58 487.44 B: yeah 

488.43 501.58 B: is that a goals gym by any chance another one 'cause we have goals here in brooklyn i'm not familiar with north abalone i have friends in oceanside island talk long beach that's about it i know you're much further you're i know 

490.26 491.11 A: no 

492.61 493.75 A: (( yeah no )) 

498.34 500.90 A: i'm further out east yeah 

501.33 502.40 A: but uh 

501.59 507.26 B: so what other possibilities could there be for a a business that would be novel that would be different 

507.11 508.44 A: um 

507.39 513.34 B: that people would have a need for that people can afford and it's uh not an easy thing to think of 

512.54 517.51 A: no like like i mean out out here in the suburbs people are 

514.91 516.06 B: yeah 

517.78 526.67 A: especially at this time of year people are looking landscaping wise and i know finding like i've found yeah gardeners landscapers 

521.41 522.28 B: (( yeah you )) 

523.05 524.24 B: mean gardening 

526.53 527.52 B: (( that's good )) 

526.59 537.22 A: i found that you know we were talking about it yesterday that trying to find somebody that's reasonably priced and reliable is not an easy thing and 

532.46 533.49 B: yeah 

536.29 537.89 B: even like gardeners 

537.69 544.00 A: yeah yeah somebody who comes in and cleans up your does cleans up all the leaves in the garden bed and weeds and 

539.24 540.49 B: (( that's bad )) 

541.40 545.87 B: (( oh forget it i know is [laughter] very expensive i know friends that )) 

544.63 549.08 A: yeah i mean it's it's hard to find somebody and then when you do they're not reliable 

548.50 549.54 B: yeah 

548.94 552.36 A: and you know that's other thing it's like i've learned through 

552.17 566.57 A: the years of owning a home that that the key is customer service you wanna you wanna if you're gonna be in a business you have to know that you got and if you wanna money you have to service the customers and you have to to be reliable and 

553.78 554.87 B: yeah 

557.42 558.96 B: yeah of course 

564.33 565.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

565.71 571.73 B: i got around that we do our own gardening here [laughter] because we have an attached house so we don't have a garden 

568.00 569.02 A: yeah 

569.96 579.43 A: right i have a small property so i i take care of it myself but i had my surgery last year so i had people take care of it for me but they weren't reliable at all they didn't do the job 

573.12 574.26 B: that's right 

576.26 577.31 B: i see 

578.14 583.91 B: but that's a good a good idea for a business also is landscaping gardening taking care of shrubbery 

580.57 582.19 A: yeah 

582.50 587.56 A: you also have to know you also have to know like i mean i myself i don't know 

587.89 594.68 A: the different i would i don't know what grows when and what you know you know colors and when they bloom 

591.28 593.21 B: no i don't either [laughter] 

593.32 599.62 B: but though you could always have somebody that's a potter that could know these things you you put the money in they put the know how in 

596.55 597.72 A: right but but 

598.74 599.85 A: yeah
