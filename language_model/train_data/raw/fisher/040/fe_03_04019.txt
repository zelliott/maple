14.23 16.08 A: okay well i think it's 

16.37 25.10 A: yeah what about perjury well first of all first of all my name is shelley and i live in um ah on the east coast and 

24.18 25.88 B: uh-huh me too 

25.55 32.31 A: okay and ah let's see perjury um we're ah was i going to commit perjury mm if i 

32.39 33.42 B: [laughter] 

32.52 35.03 A: no i probably wouldn't well it depended 

34.91 42.24 B: yeah i think so maybe probably i would do that for my friend or for my family but not for 

42.70 44.39 B: somebody i don't know 

44.08 58.42 A: right and it all depends too on the morals involved it was some if it was something really morally reprehensible i don't know that i could you know it depends ah on how strongly i felt about the particular pro- ah problem 

57.64 59.73 B: yeah yeah 

58.63 64.12 A: you know like if if it was something that's very um 

64.17 70.76 A: [lipsmack] judge- ah that's very subjective even though they broke a law but i don't agree with the law i might 

69.53 70.64 B: mhm 

70.77 79.03 B: yeah this is what i'm thinking yeah sometimes the court is really not so fair to some people 

71.48 72.44 A: (( you know but )) 

79.91 81.40 B: (( maybe the law )) 

81.55 84.12 B: itself is ah has something 

84.21 86.17 B: that need to be improved 

86.57 93.36 B: and at that time probably i would do something against the law and but do you know how 

93.39 96.09 B: (( how is ah perjury punished )) 

96.20 101.35 A: well um if you commit perjury which means that you um 

101.43 109.37 A: um you know lie in court to protect somebody um they can put you in jail too and give you a fine usually 

108.06 110.59 B: oh really in jail 

110.16 112.14 A: yeah you can get in jail 

112.11 113.49 B: (( oh huh )) 

112.67 114.85 A: yeah it depends on what it is 

113.87 115.04 B: that's tough 

115.13 116.51 B: [laughter] 

116.16 117.28 A: yeah 

117.41 118.29 B: (( but )) 

118.51 122.88 B: if it is just a fine probably it's okay for me [laughter] 

122.05 130.26 A: yeah yeah um i guess if it were something like um let's say 

131.18 136.76 A: ah my daughter um did something that was really really bad 

136.32 137.56 B: (( mhm )) 

136.81 138.99 A: and and if i 

139.50 145.34 A: told the truth she would go to jail for for her life 

145.64 148.07 A: i don't know i might try to protect her 

148.14 150.83 A: i might try to um 

150.72 155.15 B: but this is understandable right so in your case 

150.88 152.00 A: be 

152.65 154.37 A: right right 

155.34 157.75 B: i i don't think it would be so 

158.20 162.56 B: it it would need to be punished as to sent to a jail 

164.43 166.62 B: if they found out the truth 

166.31 167.27 A: right 

168.47 180.60 A: um yeah i mean they might be lenient with me or i might decide that o- once i figure out what the penalty will be i might go ahead and commit perjury 

168.55 169.37 B: so 

180.56 183.55 A: because i think i can handle the punishment 

183.49 184.73 B: yeah 

184.12 185.85 A: that could happen too 

185.67 186.79 B: yeah 

186.97 187.72 B: (( yes )) 

187.12 192.49 A: um but you know you're not supposed to [laughter] you're not supposed to do any of that stuff 

190.26 191.89 B: [laughter] i know 

192.24 193.67 B: yeah 

193.29 194.38 A: yeah 

194.58 200.87 B: yeah but sometimes it i- it really it's really hard to say when you have to 

201.31 203.71 B: tell a lie under your oath 

203.99 204.83 B: (( so )) 

205.25 207.45 B: ah in front of so many people 

207.03 207.99 A: uh-huh 

208.31 209.53 A: yeah if there's 

208.42 212.46 B: do you think your like your face will turn red or i- 

212.73 216.71 B: it would be very obvious that are telling a lie 

212.93 214.15 A: yeah i think 

216.53 224.44 A: yes i think some people can see right through it um you can usually tell when somebody's not being truthful 

219.34 221.29 B: yeah i think so 

221.95 223.42 B: [laughter] 

224.34 229.27 B: yeah i and i i see in films that those lawyers they are 

229.19 241.12 B: really they can see through you and they can ask some questions that make you make mistakes and right at that point they can point out that you are committing perjury 

231.53 232.42 A: right 

241.11 242.08 A: right 

242.26 243.74 B: this is difficult 

243.43 248.11 A: yeah yeah it is um and you know i don't trust lie detectors 

248.23 249.27 A: um 

248.51 250.04 B: i don't trust them 

249.87 257.16 A: yeah because i've seen even um examples on television where people have been able to trick 'em 

257.23 260.64 A: um so you know some people think 

260.68 264.95 A: you they can tell when somebody's lying and others say they can't 

265.01 276.34 A: ah i don't know i i dislike anything that sounds like i would not tell the truth but i have to be honest and say that at some point i might want to water it down i would not um 

275.29 276.11 B: (( mm )) 

276.72 280.19 A: ah you know i might say part of the truth you 

279.85 280.89 B: mm 

280.38 282.85 A: know so that i wasn't really lying 

283.03 290.52 B: i i think if somebody ah that they are if they are just accustomed to lying those lie detectors they wouldn't 

290.55 293.03 B: detect anything unusual 

292.95 293.93 A: uh-huh 

293.78 300.69 B: if they are telling lies all the time it's not so difficult for the to tell just one more single lie 

300.39 307.77 A: right yeah that's true that's true [sigh] yeah that's a tough question and i wonder why they picked that one 

307.35 311.27 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

307.79 308.74 A: i ah 

309.22 318.01 A: [laughter] i mean i'm not a law student or anything and i'm wondering if these phones are being tapped by the f._b._i. now the justice department 

316.15 319.43 B: [laughter] 

318.33 323.75 A: you know our our favorite person ashcroft you know he's going to tape this now 

321.16 324.31 B: (( [laughter] i think this is the )) 

324.33 331.25 B: just a ethical thing it's not a law it's not nothing about law right [laughter] 

330.37 334.92 A: no i it's just an opinion we still have freedom of speech at the moment so 

333.98 336.20 B: yeah [laughter] 

335.18 338.29 A: yeah and that's just a sample it's just a sample 

337.73 343.97 B: yeah but why don't they pick topics like something related to everyday life [laughter] 

343.68 348.96 A: yeah well there are times i mean i've i've been called for jury duty before 

348.50 349.69 B: oh really 

349.09 352.02 A: yeah and um you know it's 

351.05 353.46 B: (( is it interesting exciting )) 

353.31 358.55 A: ah well [sigh] i didn't get past the jury selection part 

357.97 359.02 B: oh 

358.46 368.78 A: yeah i i was um [lipsmack] i was part of two different jury pools actually three different jury pools in one day and i didn't get selected for any of 'em 

363.95 364.83 B: oh 

368.10 369.74 B: [laughter] 

369.04 382.43 A: the first one um they told me what the case was about and it was about child abuse and um and i broke down in tears and said i can't even listen to the testimony [laughter] 'cause i don't want to know 

374.84 375.84 B: oh 

382.12 383.26 B: oh 

382.69 385.16 A: so they excused me from that 

385.56 386.67 A: um 

386.99 392.79 A: you know the problem with the justice system and being in a jury is that everything 

392.85 402.58 A: is everything sounds right i mean this side says one thing oh yeah he's right that sounds good and then this side says something and they say yeah that's right 

398.71 400.08 B: (( mhm )) 

402.36 403.30 B: (( mm it )) 

402.61 405.14 A: and so you have to decide which one 

405.31 414.11 A: um is the correct answer based on what the law is and you know it i- it's not easy being a juror 

414.26 417.21 A: um some people say it's very interesting though 

417.06 417.78 B: (( mm )) 

417.83 425.20 B: ah do all those ah twelve people have to agree on their judgement before 

424.15 433.95 A: it depends on what it is it depends on what it is sometimes it has to be a unanimous and sometimes ah a majority i'm not sure what the difference is 

433.68 434.81 B: oh 

435.27 438.11 B: i'm not quite familiar with those things 

437.66 441.83 A: yeah yeah i think for for the bigger um 

442.01 445.75 A: [lipsmack] um charges they have to be unanimous 

445.63 448.25 B: oh like death penalty 

447.45 452.60 A: yeah like death penalty or like a murder trial or 

451.12 451.97 B: (( mm )) 

452.79 456.88 A: you know huge embezzling or something i think for minor stuff 

456.86 457.99 B: oh 

457.58 459.66 A: it it works a little differently 

459.46 460.53 B: oh 

460.62 470.51 B: i i saw on the newspaper that sometimes ah people were called for a jury duty and they didn't actually go they could be put to jail too 

470.60 485.16 A: they didn't go oh my yeah they can be sent to jail that's right i know some people who won't even ah register to vote because that's where that's where they get the roles for um the jury pool they don't want to ever be on a jury 

471.79 472.73 B: yeah 

484.89 485.87 B: oh 

485.39 486.97 A: so they don't vote either 

486.86 488.12 B: oh 

487.61 489.54 A: yeah i think that's a shame 

489.59 490.50 B: (( mm )) 

490.53 491.32 A: so 

491.44 492.83 B: [laughter] 

491.92 497.99 A: well anyway so that's ah so we're not talking about perjury anymore but um i guess we should talk about 

497.67 498.56 B: yeah 

498.25 500.90 A: ah um you know lying in general 

500.58 501.68 B: yeah 

502.39 504.22 A: you know what's a white lie 

504.99 511.38 A: is it okay to tell a white lie and well yeah everybody does ah it doesn't mean it's right but 

508.55 510.46 B: yeah everybody does 

510.72 512.97 B: (( that's a point [laughter] )) 

512.13 514.59 A: yeah sometimes you have to do it 

514.50 515.55 B: yeah 

516.18 516.95 B: (( but )) 

517.08 517.83 B: mm 

519.88 521.02 A: so 

521.24 523.05 A: um 

523.61 525.24 A: and where are you from 

525.34 527.39 B: i'm actually from china 

527.03 530.43 A: uh-huh from ah taiwan or from mainland 

527.73 528.65 B: yeah 

529.79 531.06 B: mainland 

530.46 534.02 A: uh-huh oh you have a very different justice system there 

531.17 532.58 B: an hour 

533.32 542.22 B: yeah it's totally different hey i've never seen any jury in my country and ah i i don't see any people 

542.47 544.22 B: ah they have to ah 

544.57 548.97 B: swear under oath that they are telling the truth 

548.88 549.82 A: uh-huh 

550.03 551.66 B: i don't think so i would 

550.08 555.42 A: well if they don't tell the i mean do you have juries there do you get selected for jury duty 

553.50 554.23 B: (( the )) 

555.76 558.89 B: no we don't have any jury duty 

556.38 557.70 A: oh not at all 

558.47 559.38 A: uh-huh 

559.05 560.32 B: it's ah 

560.66 564.04 B: i think if you are appearing in court you are 

564.17 569.01 B: bind by you are bound by law that you have to tell the truth but 

569.07 574.21 B: you don't have a have to ah swear under oath that you are telling 

574.67 576.98 B: the truth yeah 

574.83 577.26 A: oh really oh 

577.26 587.07 B: because we we don't make we don't have a um a religion like ah you have to swear under a bible or or something well we don't have that 

584.17 585.15 A: right 

586.65 587.70 A: mhm 

587.28 590.27 B: (( but it's just um the law )) 

590.13 591.10 A: mhm 

591.59 592.70 B: and 

591.69 597.21 A: and and so if somebody is found um that they're not telling the truth what happens 

598.18 599.95 B: probably just a fine
