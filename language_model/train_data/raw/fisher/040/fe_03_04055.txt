20.91 24.57 B: one way or another you know i i mean that's the kinda thing that 

25.17 37.63 B: [mn] well then i mean if money were no option i'm assuming i could hire like a really good financial analyst [laughter] you know because that's not uh that's not something i could deal with 

32.06 32.87 A: right 

36.88 38.78 A: (( right there's a lot of peop- if )) 

37.75 38.77 B: i mean 

38.77 53.33 A: that was me probably my prior- i'd love to do it i've never had the opportunity or the capital in fact uh here lately i've been researching uh as far as government grants and funds and stuff like that and been speaking to my wife about getting a business for ourselves or possibly uh 

53.26 55.94 A: either a restaurant or either some type of uh 

56.00 66.80 A: sports store or something like that but probably me i wouldn't trust the the p._p._a.'s and the financial advisors i'm i'm probably a workaholic and keep my nose to the book too long and uh 

65.85 67.66 B: yeah 

66.96 76.27 A: that uh yeah i'd be worried to death about the liabilities involved and what not but the other the the whole game and the whole problem is is coming up with the capital that's for sure 

74.18 81.62 B: yeah oh definitely oh definitely i mean if if i were to open a business i'd probably open a bookstore 

81.93 83.01 A: oh that'd be 

82.02 83.12 B: i 

83.32 96.57 B: i i read a lot [laughter] and and i live in new york city you know and i always i always feel that vance and noble has a bit too much of a hold here it's like i mean there's there's a vance and noble every twenty or thirty blocks in manhattan 

83.50 84.84 A: that'd be a great one 

92.45 93.34 A: right 

96.59 103.38 B: and i used to work for vance and noble you know so and i i don't like the way [laughter] they run their businesses i mean 

96.68 97.48 A: (( yep )) 

102.48 103.49 A: (( oh right [mn] )) 

103.70 111.60 A: oh that's you probably have more in common with my wife she's a i love to read but she she plants her nose in a book for a day or two until she finishes it 

103.73 105.61 B: i think that 

111.39 113.17 B: yeah 

112.20 115.58 A: (( and um dayton ohio )) 

115.28 117.01 B: right 

115.60 120.87 A: so w- we're in the manufacturing belt you know a lot of auto industry and general motors here and uh 

120.97 127.42 A: that uh you know constantly as far as small business and stuff like that yeah if i i definitely if i had the capital 

127.43 135.16 A: i would still right probably a risk with the economy like it is and what not uh if the economy was in a bet- in better shape 

127.65 129.60 B: well yeah 

131.55 133.52 B: oh yeah 

134.99 148.10 A: you know if if if this was three years ago i'd be more more apt to want to jump into it uh if i had the opportunity to use the capital but right now i'd just be scared to death that uh you know it puts you in really bad hardship 

142.82 144.57 B: yeah 

147.96 155.11 B: yeah i mean if it was like three or four years ago i would even you know just ditch the idea of starting up a store for i'd open a web base business 

155.20 156.39 A: oh yeah 

156.04 170.28 B: i mean bec- um back then when at at the top of the dot com boom when everything [laughter] you know looked like it was the absolute future and nothing could possibly go wrong you know i would i would i would probably open a small niche 

166.24 167.87 A: oh definitely 

170.11 175.32 B: probably selling you know computer hardware or something like that um you know 

173.05 176.96 A: right right oh yeah i'd like to i'd like to have been on uh 

177.21 187.45 A: on the end of owning some of yahoo stock when all and god became self made millionaires i mean i know it busted the bubble busted before they they went from zero to hundred like it was nothing 

182.36 184.21 B: [laughter] 

187.28 191.12 B: yeah and then they were smart and got out hopefully 

189.62 196.45 A: well i'm i'm hoping it'll come back around as far as the uh dot com business and and we looked in that really hard also 

196.35 197.64 A: um you know 

197.49 200.74 A: uh just a few years ago a lot of people went to 

199.60 202.40 B: (( yeah )) 

200.64 214.57 A: going into business for themselves at their home cutting the cost of all the overhead and you know and a lot of corporations down to doctors' offices you name it were paying people to work from their home so they wouldn't have the cost of uh rent or leasing buildings patients uh 

210.20 211.95 B: right 

214.33 218.39 A: having to worry about the workers comp or paying a light bill you name it and uh 

217.68 219.42 B: yeah 

218.56 224.14 A: we looked at it really hard we were really interested and it it disappoints me that the dot com has 

224.02 236.67 A: has busted like it has i'm hoping the economy will come back around the next two years and i think with technology we'll see that pick back up but the everything i've looked at studied and wanting to look at opening a business 

236.53 243.86 A: in the united states is global trade with nasa it's just putting so many of the labor jobs out of the country that uh 

242.27 243.66 B: yeah that's true 

243.63 257.52 A: [lipsmack] that you know that if if if i could get into something i would love to see about doing something like what you're talking about with a dot com business or uh you know doing even even if it was dealing with overseas you know uh global marketing and what not 

257.34 268.71 B: yeah but the problem with the problem with with with working on the internet right now is that about f- four or five years ago it was a good idea you know four or five years ago the net market wasn't as saturated as it is now 

264.36 265.58 A: (( right right )) 

268.61 276.11 B: you know when ama- when amazon started up ten years ago it was a new thing because there were you couldn't buy books online now 

275.87 282.98 B: you got amazon you blance and noble you've got books in millions you've got you know all of that stuff but you you you'd there's 

281.04 281.96 A: right 

282.79 294.08 B: anything that you want online now practically you can get and it just makes you know i mean it it makes you it though though and anything that you didn't think a website would exist for there's always e. bay 

286.87 288.03 A: (( oh yeah )) 

293.95 305.95 B: [laughter] or there's half dot com you know where where you can just slide in and find whatever you need that fills in you know any of the niche markets that that individual websites could work for 

294.18 295.11 A: right 

295.13 296.07 A: [laughter] 

296.51 297.38 A: right 

302.11 303.25 A: (( oh yeah )) 

305.59 319.06 A: oh that's just it's it's amazing you know uh years and years ago before before we ever had access to the internet anywhere from macy's department stores you know it would send their corporate executives to japan and tokyo and third world countries and shop for uh 

318.95 330.05 A: you know basically items made by third world labor to put in our store front and the access of the internet is just unreal i i hope they really push it with the business the small business associations uh 

321.31 322.18 B: (( yes )) 

330.06 335.74 A: you know because now like you said it's just uh if anything i'm gonna buy or even consider 

335.63 347.00 A: that i can just get access to it immediately and you know uh so you can price compare and what not but yeah if i could if money wasn't an object and and i had my access to a to a good business loan or uh 

346.77 347.32 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

347.08 353.14 A: or you know something that that i could do that would help spur the economy and what not then it it would probably entail 

353.06 362.61 A: if i opened any type of business it would probably be tied up in some some form or shape i would probably use the internet as much as possible for my business you know uh 

362.62 368.55 A: uh look at using that access instead of doing sort of you know the hard knocks way the old school way 

368.33 373.59 B: yeah i'm involved with with the thing about at least living in a metropolitan area like new york is that 

373.42 387.96 B: the the net for uh after you know the all the hype died down because we killed a lot of local businesses around here a lot of them you know if if i can go to vance and noble and order a book and if i order it before noon it'll be here the same day 

379.60 380.50 A: right 

387.95 388.82 A: right 

388.16 394.11 B: [laughter] why would i you know apart from the exercise why would i get up and leave why would i go 

394.14 401.66 B: and you know head down to my local bookstore i don't need to do it anymore you know i give 'em a couple of extra bucks in shipping and they don't charge me tax or at least they didn't then 

401.60 403.17 A: right right 

402.23 407.69 B: you know and and it's it's we live in a culture that is based on convenience you 

407.78 412.48 B: know absolute convenience and you know oh what was it back um 

407.87 409.11 A: (( oh yeah )) 

412.26 425.51 B: [lipsmack] it was i think it was oldsmobile or chrysler you know back in the sixties where they went from marketing cars to marketing a lifestyle associated with the cars you know i mean it's not the it's not a a car gets you from one place to another 

416.12 416.95 A: right 

419.81 421.45 A: (( oh yeah exactly )) 

425.33 432.52 B: [laughter] and that's basically it and anything else they throw in there they don't sell the features anymore really unless they're safety features unless they're you know 

432.32 443.27 B: airbags or you know side impact dent panels and all that stuff it's not that anymore it's what buying this car will do for your life [laughter] 

433.05 433.85 A: right 

440.18 444.56 A: yeah let's let's get it yeah will it fit your image that's it exactly 

444.26 457.14 B: yeah and i mean it's it's it's just ridiculous and even when you said well you know i'm gonna go counter culture you know i'm not going to buy anything from microsoft or i'm not going to buy anything from one of the big 

444.58 445.52 A: yeah 

457.15 464.55 B: um you know big car manufacturers or what not well there are marketing companies that now market towards that niche so there's nowhere you can go 

464.44 474.77 B: you know you don't want to buy microsoft buy a mac [laughter] you know and advertising is very slick you know you don't wanna deal with master card go to american express their advertising right now is very very smooth 

464.63 465.46 A: right 

467.12 467.93 A: (( right exactly yeah )) 

474.73 486.87 B: you know you don't want an oldsmobile get one of the little volkswagen beatles you know and and it and it then then if you truly want to be counter culture and [mn] it takes so much work 

475.20 476.57 A: (( oh wow [laughter] right )) 

486.75 487.54 A: right 

486.86 501.13 B: that i i mean i know so many people who who have been like damn the man and do the whole thing and given you know two or three years they'll give up because it's so much work and and you can't look anywhere without being hit with that kind of corporate 

501.37 504.10 B: advertising you can't and so 

501.85 504.57 A: oh yeah well that's like 

504.23 508.35 B: you know when it comes back to opening up a local business around here we'd be or 

508.20 521.04 B: you know i don't know much about [cough] going further west but around here we don't have a prayer you know i mean apart from you know real estate and and um real estate prices and taxes and regulations and legislation and all of that stuff 

512.70 513.70 A: (( yeah )) 

520.39 525.40 A: oh yeah well that makes it hard that makes it hard here my father in law he's a 

521.07 523.22 B: i mean that 

525.46 529.65 A: a you know a different spectrum and a different era than you guys over there in new york but 

528.11 529.80 B: right 

529.65 540.28 A: uh just a couple of years ago he went right when right when the uh two thousand election happened he decided to go back he's been a general contractor for years and he decided to go back into business for himself 

540.27 548.32 A: and the economy goes down the tubes and uh he is just struggling struggling and trying to run it on his own it's about bankrupt him two or three times in the last two years 

547.57 549.78 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

548.23 554.98 A: and uh you know we just spoke to him today and i told him he said boy i'm i would love to have a business loan about now and uh 

554.06 555.92 B: (( yeah )) 

554.89 561.10 A: he's he's scared to and but that's the you know the issue uh where's the money gonna come from you know 

561.00 567.14 A: uh how can i get the money how much you know could i if i could get through the red tape of getting any money from uh 

567.04 581.97 A: from loans from the government or anything like that you know how long how much the interest rate's gonna be what are they gonna charge me you know what where do i go from here and uh the paper trail the money's out there but the paper trail i mean i've done some serious research and the paper trail's just unreal 

581.45 583.28 B: [laughter] 

581.83 584.44 A: what you have to go through to get to it 

584.11 585.87 B: yeah 

584.34 593.10 A: and and i think that is a major major uh uh discouragement to people who wanna get into small business but uh 

593.00 599.90 A: yeah as far as as far as the topic if money was no object well i could come up with a with a million things and like you said 

593.11 594.79 B: (( right )) 

596.48 597.82 B: yeah i know
