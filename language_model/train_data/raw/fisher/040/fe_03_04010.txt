84.78 85.86 A: mhm 

85.43 87.12 B: and 

87.61 97.85 B: with my friends and my one of my best friends and i we have this this really [lipsmack] and people think it's really weird it's like even though i i'm married now and 

97.89 100.24 B: i tell my husband that 

100.28 110.92 B: it's really hard for me to say now but even if something were to happen and you know he were to go to jail and if i knew that it wasn't his fault you know he was with me or what have you 

111.14 114.95 B: um i'd still find it difficult to visit him in jail 

115.04 116.05 A: mhm 

115.49 125.08 B: and so committing perjury for him as much as i love him to death [laughter] i don't think that i would do that i i 

120.66 121.57 A: right 

125.22 135.47 B: i have a newborn that's three months old and now i think that the stakes are even a little bit higher [laughter] i think the stakes are higher and 

132.66 133.68 A: right 

134.35 135.53 A: definitely 

135.29 146.35 B: a friend and family member i'd do i'd tell my family that i'll do just about anything for them within reason and well i don't know i i think 

147.37 152.67 B: there are certain limits of the law that i i'll um [lipsmack] i can't 

153.18 162.34 B: can't really abide by it secondly i mean um i have a security guard licence there are a lot of things that would [laughter] definitely prevent me from doing these things 

158.72 160.34 A: oh yeah 

161.97 164.58 A: yeah really yeah definitely 

163.04 164.25 B: [laughter] 

164.68 165.97 A: definitely 

164.94 165.73 B: (( yeah )) 

166.08 167.45 A: do you work full time

174.76 176.24 A: mhm mhm 

175.61 180.41 B: yeah i'm really not ready to leave the nest but i have to [laughter] 

178.63 181.07 A: (( right i hear you i hear you )) 

180.84 182.00 B: (( oh you understand )) 

181.77 186.94 A: yeah i have two ah boys twenty one and eighteen and i've been married for twenty four years 

185.24 186.53 B: oh 

186.76 189.22 B: wow congratulations 

188.49 198.89 A: thank you but i probably wouldn't do it either and even though um teenagers can get into trouble and what ever i don't think i would ah 

195.81 198.00 B: yeah that's true 

199.36 205.87 A: do that either 'cause there are certain standards that i think that i need to maintain and i think i would be 

204.33 205.35 B: (( right )) 

205.85 214.84 A: you know doing more harm than good if i were to set that example for my well for my kids even though i would hate for that to happen 

208.40 209.70 B: (( exactly mhm )) 

214.81 216.16 B: exactly 

214.98 221.60 A: but you know and i would hope that i would never have to [laughter] have be in that position but you never know i guess 

220.06 232.50 B: i know i know that's what i said too that's the example i mean if my nieces or nephews were to get in trouble that wouldn't be a good example for me to present to them 

232.61 246.19 B: to continue with because then everyone i mean you could start the ball with one person if they broke the law i did it for a reason whatever the reason may be but then the person that you committed perjury for 

238.67 239.69 A: right 

246.54 259.64 B: will then see that it's okay to possibly do it for someone they love or something and it's just ah you'd just be nowhere there are already so many people that do it um that commit perjury 

259.76 260.87 B: for 

260.94 267.44 B: reasons that they feel that they're justified for and it's actually against the law so i don't [laughter] 

263.31 264.20 A: right 

264.91 277.86 A: yeah it really is it really well that and you're putting yourself in a situation well you know so and so got me out of trouble maybe th- she can help you too or whatever you know i mean you're setting yourself for you know several examples of 

272.68 273.96 B: right 

274.89 275.70 B: (( exactly )) 

277.15 279.49 B: exactly right 

278.19 281.46 A: not being able to just get yourself out of it you know what i mean 

280.42 292.91 B: exactly like well you did it for so and so why won't you do it for me or you have more than one of 'em on trial then like well you did it for this one and can and that's bad that's really something that you don't want to get caught up into 

287.59 288.54 A: right 

292.48 295.54 A: right right especially a family member because you feel 

295.33 308.23 A: especially if you're the older of the you know the the the couple or whatever you you have i feel i really believe that you have to set a standard and if you don't set that standard in ah being a good example what kind of adult are you you know what i mean 

305.68 306.59 B: (( [noise] )) 

307.61 310.39 B: [noise] [noise] that's true 

309.95 323.51 A: you know so especially your kids i just feel like i've set this moral standard all my life for them and i don't want to you know do that for something that you know they should have acted right the beginning [laughter] you know what i mean so 

312.44 313.50 B: mhm 

324.60 326.22 B: (( [noise] [noise] that's true )) 

325.86 327.29 A: yeah so 

327.12 327.77 B: (( um )) 

327.99 330.02 B: (( [noise] that is very very true ))

388.93 394.57 A: yeah i did i did with my with the mate what does most compar- what do you find would be most 

394.67 401.16 A: ah of value in looking for your future mate that's one i did yeah that was an interesting topic 

397.97 402.77 B: oh really that's pretty interesting yeah [laughter] 

401.67 404.73 A: that was really that was really a good topic 

402.93 408.85 B: (( that honestly would be interesting yeah i like that one [laughter] )) 

405.14 406.07 A: yeah 

406.62 412.89 A: yeah i thought so it was it and we could ah really talk they they broke us off and we didn't even get to say goodbye to each other [laughter] 

410.07 410.93 B: i 

411.18 421.15 B: that's so funny 'cause i would say i could do end- i mean that [laughter] that topic is is pretty intense and long and you can talk for a while about that one [laughter] 

414.36 415.73 A: [laughter] 

419.37 426.27 A: yeah you you really can you really can yeah this situation you either have an opinion or you don't you know kind of a 

421.51 423.37 B: (( that one's so fun )) 

425.26 432.29 B: right exactly it's like either you do or you don't and you either you're for it or against it and 

431.43 432.51 A: right 

433.09 439.84 B: i think that you know with our topic it's pretty i don't know to me it's pretty clear cut and i guess there are people that you know [noise] 

437.59 438.55 A: yeah 

440.25 448.29 B: either fortunately or unfortunately the two of us see eye to eye and the two of us see eye to eye and there's really no justification for 

449.46 452.37 B: [noise] committing perjury so 

450.09 450.98 A: right 

451.32 462.79 A: right i agr- i totally agree and i was a court reporter for a few years too so you have to take an oath of you know you you just just can't do that that's just totally against the law 'cause you're working for the court system and 

452.68 454.45 B: [laughter] 

455.80 456.92 B: oh really 

462.01 463.52 B: exactly 

462.70 466.96 A: you know you have to be an upright citizen i work in a bank now so 

466.34 469.13 B: oh really okay so [laughter] 

467.76 472.97 A: ah you know so there's just certain standards that you have to have to to be in those positions 

470.61 474.76 B: exactly in order to have that position mhm 

473.51 479.48 A: that's right so not not just a good citizen but a you know really a moral person too you know 

475.78 476.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

479.06 482.83 B: exactly sometimes i remember um a while ago an 

483.32 489.75 B: ex boyfriend of mine said that [sigh] that i was too moral [laughter] like what do you mean 

488.51 489.33 A: yeah 

489.59 490.92 A: [laughter] 

490.14 497.48 B: like i don't understand how that could be possible [laughter] it's like i don't think he's like you're very ideal and you 

493.29 495.31 A: right right 

497.29 505.93 B: anything i don't think so i think that that's how i i think that i should you know stand by my beliefs and my values so therefore 

506.19 517.90 B: if i were to have children and i'd raise them the same way and i think that it's very good not to be easily influenced by the public and by public opinion and just 

515.33 516.34 A: right 

516.85 518.07 A: totally 

517.83 530.26 B: it doesn't really matter what other people think about you know how my beliefs and my values that's how i was raised and [noise] that's what i'm going to continue to pass on to my kids so 

529.38 534.45 A: right right i believe in that too that's right that's so true and it's so important to do that 

531.14 532.43 B: [laughter] 

534.24 535.43 B: (( that is )) 

534.47 544.30 A: 'cause your kids are your ah you know your they're your eternal values you know there's not you can invest in a car and that'll wear out you can invest in your house and that'll you know that's gonna fall apart eventually anyway 

538.91 539.73 B: (( exactly )) 

544.08 552.47 A: yeah but your children are something they'll you know that they they'll pay off all the other people what you've taught them and the house and the car and all that they won't do that so 

544.25 545.72 B: (( exactly [noise] )) 

551.88 555.05 B: exactly that is so true [noise] 

552.64 554.10 A: you know they're 

554.41 562.20 A: so that's why i believe in in you know in investing in that and and that's why you have to be a moral upstanding person and a good citizen and 

561.64 573.29 B: exactly i mean it's not just a a lot of people do or do it or say that it's you know all for show but it's a lifestyle i mean it's [laughter] it's the way 

562.57 563.98 A: right right 

573.28 580.02 B: it's not only in cert- on certain occasions that you would do that i think it's just 

579.95 582.28 B: it becomes so second nature 

582.05 583.01 A: right 

582.19 587.54 B: to me that i don't think of it as such a big deal that's [laughter] some people try to 

587.45 597.42 B: say oh well now i need to be a good husband and but that should just be a natural everyday thing i don't know [laughter] 

596.61 599.89 A: right that's right because to me if you're gonna ah
