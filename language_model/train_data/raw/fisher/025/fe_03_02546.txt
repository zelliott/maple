420.58 421.59 A: (( you know what's )) 

422.70 430.56 A: yeah i think he is you know and actually i was talking to him the other about this whole scott peterson thing i'm sure you've heard about it 

424.86 425.81 B: (( [mn] )) 

429.94 431.29 B: oh yeah mhm 

431.01 439.28 A: because you know for a while he was gonna be defended by his ah the public defender of modesto and i just wanted to talk to my brother about what he thought about it 

439.43 441.23 A: and it's just crazy i mean 

442.37 448.29 A: [noise] people are so quick to convict him even though they don't know any of the details about it you know and 

448.26 458.81 A: they see this pretty white girl who was murdered with her with her unborn child and they're so quick to like say oh so and so's guilty it's gotta her husband he's such a slime ball and 

457.67 464.43 B: gotta be her husband yeah i mean yeah all we know are sort of the d- dirty old details we don't know anything about their lives really 

459.26 461.13 A: my brother's yeah my 

464.68 467.31 A: yeah you don't know anything i mean 

464.92 465.83 B: so i guess i 

468.26 469.69 A: what do i know 

468.56 480.48 B: mean it's it's usually pretty typical though for the for the husband to have been the one that actually did it so it [laughter] may be not a an unreasonable assumption to which um people have jumped [laughter] 

474.26 475.88 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

479.57 491.85 A: well well my brother said was like you know one out of four spouses cheat on s- cheat on their spouse and just because they cheat doesn't mean that you know one out of four spouses murders their husband of wife 

485.55 486.76 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

491.70 502.37 A: you know even though the guy's a scumbag doesn't mean that he's guilty of murder and just because he has this mistress and all this circumstantial evidence doesn't mean that he needs to have his life taken away literally 

502.38 507.18 A: like put to death i mean there's it's just it's not [noise] it's not logical 

507.20 512.19 A: but so many people wanna jump on that bandwagon it's like fry that guy you know 

512.75 516.21 A: [noise] so weird so do you go to trial and stuff [noise] 

516.21 519.39 B: mm mm not often no i rarely go to trial 

519.83 525.50 B: and it's kind of reminded me actually the way people w- w- the way people reacted to ah nicole brown simpson's murder 

525.49 527.37 A: [noise] yeah i feel the same way 

526.92 534.50 B: yeah it r- really is people felt so personally attached to her is what was really surprising to me yeah i mean somebody who 

531.34 532.75 A: isn't that funny 

534.76 540.25 B: would never have given any of us the time of day [laughter] [laughter] she lived in her completely own world and 

537.58 539.24 A: exactly 

540.40 547.29 A: well as a civil rights lawyer how do you feel about that though i mean here's a high profile african american 

540.92 542.58 B: couldn't have related to any of us 

547.36 550.73 A: you know hyper masculine personality 

550.95 556.03 A: who's been put on the stand for this because you know probably circumstantial evidence i don't know 

556.15 559.26 A: it was so long ago i don't know anything about it 

556.44 562.89 B: right well my personal yeah my personal view on the thing was that he he probably killed her but he was framed by the police i 

563.33 575.48 B: i think there was a lot of mishandling of evidence intentionally and i think they intentionally framed him i mean think a- the the killer drops one glove at the scene of scene of the crime and drops the other glove in his own backyard 

563.40 565.04 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

575.51 577.72 B: that's just not gonna happen so 

575.53 576.43 A: hm 

577.91 582.67 B: [noise] and and i think as a lawyer my perspective on that is that ah to have innocent 

578.43 579.27 A: and 

582.81 588.83 B: go free is the price that we as a society pay when the police misconduct themselves in that way 

589.08 599.96 A: [cough] isn't that funny that in a way that whole trial was kind of in itself reality t._v. and all of us wanted to just escape our lives and be glued to the car chase and gl- 

594.16 595.19 B: yeah [laughter]
