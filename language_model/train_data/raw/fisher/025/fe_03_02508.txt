6.55 11.40 B: [laughter] uh i kind of like it it's it's all right um 

11.30 18.74 B: like uh the mr personality show i i think that one's okay 'cause everybody's a little bit more honest if the guys don't want to go through with it they're 

18.64 26.55 B: usually willing to take off their masks and say you know i've had it you know and walk away whereas uh joe millionaire [cough] was okay 

21.39 23.36 A: right 

26.61 31.71 B: in the beginning but i didn't think he was actually going to stay with that girl in the end 'cause she 

30.69 32.39 A: yeah i didn't think so either 

32.03 36.42 B: 'cause she wasn't really really into him you know 

35.17 37.60 A: yeah she was looking at the money right [laughter] 

37.41 41.71 B: yeah and it was just killing him having to be someone he wasn't you know 

41.42 48.11 A: right right yeah i mean eh you know what it comes down to everybody wants to be a star 

42.45 43.49 B: yeah 

43.51 44.32 B: but it 

47.89 49.38 B: yeah basically 

49.06 52.59 A: and this is an easy way for someone to become a celebrity 

52.18 54.40 B: yeah and also uh 

53.63 56.81 A: you know what i say i don't need to be because i'm already famous 

56.27 59.57 B: [laughter] oh you're already famous [laughter] are you su- really 

59.33 60.58 A: (( no i'm just kidding )) 

60.29 64.63 B: [laughter] yes um as far as reality shows go um 

64.67 65.71 B: (( uh )) 

65.26 66.72 A: where are you calling from 

66.57 67.55 B: l. a. 

67.16 68.70 A: oh you're in l. a. okay 

68.31 73.57 B: yeah it's competing with all the other shows that aren't based on the whole reality thing 

73.23 77.02 A: right would you consider fear factor a reality show 

74.18 75.26 B: but um 

76.80 77.68 B: huh 

77.34 80.39 A: you know f- is fear factor considered a reality show 

79.95 92.25 B: uh it's reality in in the in the way where if a person is is uh challenged and they're actually frightened and you get to see some real emotion i think you could say it's a reality show but other than that 

90.66 91.85 A: right right 

92.09 96.80 B: um you know it's a it's a battle of wills to competition i really wouldn't call it a reality show 

96.59 97.76 A: (( yeah i hear you )) 

97.89 101.97 A: to to me the beginning of the reality shows was like the gong show when i was a kid 

101.64 103.76 B: yeah yeah i used to watch that 

102.54 105.56 A: chuck chuck berry's right 

103.95 107.47 B: uh-huh yeah i used to watch that when i was a kid sure did 

107.02 112.11 A: yeah yeah there's so many reality shows i can't keep up with all of them 

107.86 109.44 B: yeah it was pretty good 

111.64 120.00 B: yeah i can't either the only one that i really pay attention to is um [lipsmack] i i think i was watching it last night uh the bachelor 

119.73 121.14 A: right right 

120.48 125.76 B: yeah but he's pretty easy to figure out i mean as far as i'm concerned the only girl he wants is kirsten 

125.84 128.04 A: which one was that 

126.77 135.80 B: uh she's a she's a brunette she's real exotic looking in comparison to the the one that got uh the other brunette that got um ousted last night 

134.80 138.87 A: she got she got the boot right she got the spanish elbow 

136.55 137.66 B: yeah 

138.54 148.23 B: yeah uh-huh yeah i think he really likes kirsten but then i also think that he thinks it's a challenge to go after the blonde uh tina fabulous 

147.61 150.65 A: right yeah every guy thinks the blonde is a challenge 

149.96 158.58 B: yeah well well he thinks it's a challenge to go after her because she's so cold you know he's determined to [mn] to prove to himself that she's going to like him 

153.97 155.13 A: yeah 

158.26 159.81 A: right right 

159.14 163.63 B: and she's the only one in her family that actually behaves like that 

163.46 174.93 B: and it's uh it's a shame to see him eventually pick her if he does do that because he'll be spending the rest of of what maybe two or three weeks trying to convince her that she really wants to be with him 

174.57 177.33 A: right yeah she has like a bit of a chip on her shoulder right 

176.70 179.06 B: uh yeah she has a problem with him 

177.97 180.38 A: she's she's like lisa marie presley 

180.03 185.78 B: [laughter] yeah yeah who who looks like elvis but she looks like a really mean elvis you know 

184.05 187.93 A: [laughter] yeah you know she's just a spoiled brat that's what it is 

187.36 188.42 B: uh-huh 

188.00 189.62 A: but i think she's cute though [laughter] 

189.56 194.51 B: yeah she's attractive she looks so much like him though she's just not like him 

192.26 193.63 A: yeah she does 

194.57 204.63 B: and i guess because she really didn't grow up as close to him as she could've been you know elvis being on drugs and everything you can't really get close to people so she turned out the way she did 

200.67 202.73 A: right right 

203.39 206.02 A: yeah she had a rough childhood i'm sure 

205.75 207.18 B: yeah 

206.50 209.18 A: so are there any wha- what was i going to say um [lipsmack] 

210.29 213.25 A: what's the la- what's the newest reality show that's happening 

213.16 218.32 B: uh i think uh mr personality is the newest one it comes on monday's 

216.19 217.47 A: that's the newest 

217.56 219.20 A: that's the guy with the mask 

218.83 220.02 B: uh-huh 

219.49 220.92 A: right right 

220.26 224.43 B: yeah she's after the guy there's a guy on there that's a um 

224.51 227.86 B: (( uh what do what does he call himself motivational speaker )) 

227.45 229.45 A: right right 

228.15 242.00 B: and i figure he already had an edge because he's he's already uh figured out what she wants to hear how she wants to be treated and sh- and she doesn't you know she's vulnerable enough to 

241.94 251.01 B: not be able to see through him so i feel i feel he's the one she's going to go after eventually and all the other guys are just being strung along pretty much 

249.69 251.66 A: right right 

251.07 254.54 B: but they all become celebrities after it's all over you know [laughter] 

253.42 258.22 A: yeah you see that's the whole thing they may become a celebrity and then it it it catapults them into 

258.57 262.70 A: doing pretty much what you know uh other you know whatever they want 

262.48 263.59 B: yeah 

262.89 265.35 A: and they have all this you know notoriety 

265.29 276.77 B: like uh i guess you could call american idol a reality show i guess i don't know i watch that but um the only person i really like on there is clay i think clay's an excellent singer no that's josh 

268.68 270.54 A: yeah 

273.57 274.98 A: is that the marine 

276.26 278.13 A: josh is the marine right 

277.20 278.22 B: uh-huh 

278.50 280.01 A: do you think he can sing 

279.89 292.01 B: well josh is okay but clay clay can out sing all of them even if he doesn't have the dancing and the the image that they're looking for he has the voice long enough for people to listen you know 

283.24 284.59 A: yeah he can 

289.52 290.88 A: right right 

291.70 299.39 A: yeah josh is uh [mn] i think because of the war [mn] he's a marine you know i think that ha- that he has an edge because of that 

295.06 296.34 B: (( uh-huh i )) 

298.69 309.77 B: wish they hadn't lied about that because see they had already pulled some strings so he wouldn't have to go i knew that from the beginning and they you know they lied about that they wanted to have him around in the in the event that he might get chosen 

303.09 304.97 A: see that 

309.44 311.82 A: right they swept that under the rug right 

311.19 322.45 B: uh-huh but last night he was um he was pretty upset last night because i think they got rid of trenice and they were kind of making him look like it should've been him 

322.60 331.71 B: you know they but between him and trenice he he should've done the worse but when you have a bunch of marines all voting for you you know it makes a really big difference [laughter] 

322.60 323.62 A: yeah 

330.33 332.85 A: yeah exactly 

331.86 333.98 B: (( i'll be able to tell you're not voting for )) 

333.13 334.97 A: [laughter] 

334.89 339.16 B: him but uh now you know he can do country and western but how many garth brooks are there you know 

338.82 340.80 A: yeah 

339.29 345.26 B: only one he sounds like garth brooks and reuben i think reuben is really good you know but um 

345.68 352.67 B: as far as r. and b. is concerned um he i could i could find at least four other guys that sound like him 

352.91 354.39 A: yeah 

352.91 365.25 B: you know he's he's good but but you have to you have to have something that's a little bit different and i think it would be interesting to see them bring out the best in clay without changing who he is 

364.78 366.00 A: right right [laughter] 

365.54 371.13 B: he's kind of like a johnny appleseed looking character you know but he has an excellent voice 

370.83 373.41 A: yeah he can sing right 

372.12 379.28 B: yeah it's it's it's almost as good as it would've been you know back in the seventies when you had people like neil diamond singing and you had 

379.23 391.10 B: um a lot of other singers out there that had mellow voices and they were you know considered classic rock or well not even classic rock soft rock that's what they called it so even if he did 

388.05 389.01 A: right 

390.12 392.04 A: corporate rock right 

391.37 401.90 B: uh-huh even if does make it he's going to he's going to be the kind of voice you hear on k._b._a. wave or something like that they're not really going to be able to change him into 

401.90 406.75 B: what they want him to be but he has an excellent voice i can sit and listen to it and not watch him 

404.13 405.72 A: (( [mn] right )) 

406.28 412.95 A: and not watch him at all because he can sing right what about like the what about like the m._t._v.'s real world do are you into that 

408.24 409.38 B: yeah 

412.37 425.03 B: um i was watching that i haven't watched it in a long time so last time i had a look at it it was like last year maybe year before that but i thought it was pretty good last time i saw it there was a hawaiian girl on there that had a drinking problem 

424.49 427.77 A: yeah yeah she was always uh hawaii 

425.52 426.61 B: and 

427.42 436.14 B: yeah and that that was the last time i actually watched it i watch the osbournes uh sometimes and i'm a fan of ozzy osbourne i 

436.05 444.72 B: been watching well actually watching him and listening to his music for a long time but i don't i don't care for his wife or his daughter 

439.84 440.91 A: oh really 

444.73 452.67 B: i don't care for that see in my house you can't say f. you you mother [laughter] you know you can't do that but you know 

444.83 447.54 A: yeah yeah they're [mn] yeah 

448.98 451.16 A: oh you can't do that yeah 

451.57 454.70 A: yeah he has a drink the son is [mn] is in rehab now 

454.53 463.13 B: yeah he is that's not surprising though but the thing with ozzy is that ozzy is on um medication for uh 

461.36 464.18 A: (( depression anxiety )) 

463.81 465.90 B: no it's it's manic depression 

465.61 467.16 A: right 

466.40 470.69 B: and he should've been on it many years ago but he's on it now so that's why 

470.48 481.78 B: he's you know teetering around like he's on the edge of a cliff basically because his medication does that to him but then he's got sharon next to him all the time and she's everything he can't be 

481.81 494.37 B: uh as well everything he doesn't need to be you know she's loud when he's not she's talking when he's not when he's not talking you know she's likely to embarrass herself in public in ways where he's already been there and done that 

493.92 495.12 A: right right 

494.50 509.11 B: you know it seems to me that he would need somebody next to him that uh that would bring out the best of him and put up with whatever the medication makes him want to do whereas she seems to be the kind of person who needs as much medication as he's on 

509.23 515.48 B: i mean when she got socked in the jaw that wasn't for nothing it's because she uh she spat on the girl that hit her 

515.12 520.50 A: right right yeah she thinks she can just get away with that right 

515.90 516.73 B: you know 

517.32 519.19 B: she saw her in a restaurant 

519.26 527.15 B: uh-huh she saw her in a restaurant she hassled her about the uh the the necklace that she had won i guess fair and square 

526.58 527.80 A: mhm 

527.16 534.17 B: and she didn't like the fact that that uh she had won probably won the ticket from her and said something nasty to her and got punched in the jaw 

534.02 535.29 A: right right 

534.11 545.44 B: i mean sharon is that type if you've seen her on the m._t._v. awards or whatever every other word is an f. word then you know that's how she's going to carry herself in public but in england she can never get away with that she'd get ignored mhm 

543.86 547.14 A: yeah she's got a toilet mouth right [sigh] 

547.39 557.37 B: but i i have respect for ozzy other than the fact that you know he used to bite birds heads off and all that stuff but some of his music is pretty cool i think crazy train was a great song i loved it 

556.51 558.87 A: (( oh the crazy train )) 

558.04 558.98 B: (( [laughter] )) 

559.05 560.05 B: (( he seem mm )) 

559.22 562.95 A: let me ask you a question about these calls we we have to do three of these calls 

564.99 566.34 A: is that how it works 

566.07 567.08 B: three 

566.72 568.16 A: yeah 

567.86 570.51 B: oh was is it like three different questions or something 

569.68 571.76 A: three different calls we have to call in 

571.61 576.14 B: oh yeah we do but not in the same night it's like consecutive nights 

574.19 575.36 A: (( is that right )) 

575.42 578.80 A: so once after the third call that's it you don't have to call again 

578.40 579.63 B: right 

579.52 581.70 A: and then they send us the money right 

581.34 585.26 B: i guess so they told me four to six weeks i'm hoping it's sooner than that 

584.75 586.10 A: beautiful 

585.66 592.56 B: [laughter] i hope it is but the lady i talked to was mean she's some indian lady i could tell by the sound of her voice 

591.95 598.09 A: oh one of your other call you're you're the second because this is the second call and the the first person was from l. a. also 

593.37 594.39 B: uh-huh
