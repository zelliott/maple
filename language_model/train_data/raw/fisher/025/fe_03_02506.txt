24.19 25.23 B: you do 

24.79 35.92 A: mm yeah because it seems like she's not she don't she don't see the uh the uh physical appearance of the person first so she's going by the personality and how they're acting and when they this weekend they were drinking and

44.94 47.77 B: well that's like uh on the uh bachelor 

47.98 62.38 B: that i think what makes it uh the bachelor so popular is the because there are so many women looking for mr right you know and and probably just like mr personality too you miss you know the ladies looking for mr right too 

55.62 56.68 A: it's true 

61.96 63.67 A: right 

62.62 66.75 B: so um it just seems like with the bachelor they 

66.80 67.80 B: (( you know they )) 

67.84 77.49 B: [mn] it was just a funny show lately because it seems like he keeps telling each one he's interested in 'em and then at the last minute it's like no you're not going to get a rose so

102.11 103.09 A: right 

102.76 115.37 B: and with um not so many people getting involved with it by watching it because they think oh well you know they're just going to do the same thing they did last season whereas they try to get a new place like thailand or you know

307.87 311.16 A: oh yeah that was stupid that made you watch it though 

309.33 310.48 B: yeah 

310.84 325.55 B: yeah i know yeah because they even said that [cough] charlie the one that wasn't chosen he even said he thought that you know that even when he watched it that he he could see how the public thought it was going to be him 

312.04 313.02 A: (( [laughter] )) 

325.09 326.16 A: right 

325.82 328.60 B: you know [laughter] which is funny you know to think that 

328.16 334.65 A: then they had who wants to marry a millionaire and that end- then she i think i don't know if she married him and got divorced or something [laughter] 

330.40 331.59 B: uh-huh 

333.17 333.73 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

334.21 335.93 B: oh yeah yeah 

334.91 338.32 A: to garrett connor or whatever hell comvy or something 

337.93 339.49 B: mhm 

338.84 340.32 A: that was funny too 

339.87 353.46 B: i know yeah all different ones but i think a lot of people are interested in 'em because they like the the excitement and they tune in every week you know to watch it so i i maybe i really think that people enjoy watching them 

353.19 360.93 A: i think it's like a nosy neighbour like you're eavesdropping into people's lives like bits and maybe it's m- more adventurous than your own life 

357.40 358.74 B: mhm 

360.33 367.79 B: yeah yeah or it's something you might be wishing for you know that they'd rather have the glamorous life like that 

367.49 368.39 A: right 

367.73 375.88 B: you know that they um could be lavished with gifts every week or you know go out and yeah [laughter] 

372.62 374.93 A: i wish [laughter] 

376.20 384.22 B: you know and go these different places and have a a sit down dinner served to you every night and you know [cough] 

381.38 382.47 A: right 

383.48 388.24 A: well i couldn't believe the end of joe millionaire 'cause the woman did get a million dollars and the guy just 

387.63 389.28 B: yeah 

388.76 391.69 A: ending it like that that was really nice 

389.74 391.11 B: i know 

391.23 396.01 B: mhm i know that was kind of the twist to the e- whole thing at the end you know 

395.50 397.32 A: yeah you weren't expecting it 

396.81 402.95 B: yeah yeah but i think more people are interested in 'em so i think they'll be adding more and more all the time too 

401.88 410.10 A: they should make 'em earlier in the day because all they have is talk shows on and soap operas which i watch but it's getting boring the talk shows are getting ridiculous 

409.51 411.42 B: oh yeah mhm 

410.82 417.50 A: so they should have them on maybe like du- even if they have to repeat them for people who can't stay up that late they should put the reality shows during the day 

417.13 425.20 B: mhm that would be a good idea yeah you know because like you said with people being home all day all they watch is the soap operas but 

418.81 420.18 A: yeah 

424.58 425.96 A: yeah 

425.36 427.60 B: they could just switch off and watch that 

427.30 428.16 A: mhm 

427.75 428.73 B: (( you know )) 

428.53 430.30 A: i wish they would 

429.48 432.95 B: mhm i i think they will i'll think they'll add more 

433.17 438.45 B: and i think like fox t._v. is getting into um more 

438.19 440.47 A: (( yeah they're doing it a lot but )) 

439.40 445.30 B: yeah yeah seems like everytime they're talking about the new s- shows they're they're reality ones 

445.48 448.92 A: i wonder where you go to audition for these things [laughter] 

447.55 454.51 B: i know it [laughter] yeah i guess they probably get a lot of resumes from people that want to be on those shows 

453.89 454.87 A: uh-huh 

454.66 461.01 B: and then um [lipsmack] what was that other one i was thinking of um fear factor 

460.66 467.30 A: oh that was disgusting oh [laughter] with the roaches and they had these things that were crawling over them oh 

461.99 463.85 B: oh my goodness 

465.90 466.81 B: oh 

466.83 468.41 B: it was terrible 

467.82 471.71 A: i watched it but it was getting me nauseous i had to turn it off [laughter] 

470.75 476.38 B: yeah i'd be like to turning my head you know sometime when they'd have different ones that emptied the bugs or what 

475.76 484.34 A: yeah that's disgusting but there was one where um oh maybe it was fear factor where you had people have swallowed bugs was that it 

476.84 477.87 B: (( there )) 

482.53 486.27 B: oh yeah uh-huh oh yeah yeah 

484.53 485.60 A: okay 

485.67 487.69 A: that was the fu- that was disgusting 

487.37 488.65 B: i know 

488.03 490.75 A: [laughter] i don't care how much money [laughter] you're going 

490.18 493.77 B: (( [laughter] i don't think i want to swallow any bugs either [mn] )) 

492.76 497.66 A: to get no and they were eating like i think w- worms or something that was alive 

496.96 507.95 B: yeah and they had the time when they put 'em like in a plastic casket and had all these rats running across them and stuff i thought oh yeah that'd be the day when i'd be in some casket with a bunch of rats climbing all over me 

501.34 502.81 A: oh [laughter] 

506.40 508.44 A: (( oh it's disgusting [laughter] )) 

507.90 513.66 B: and they had to put goggles on because the rats would go right toward their eyes and stuff and i thought oh geez 

512.56 515.24 A: oh they probably scratch or some yeah 

513.78 524.22 B: yeah mhm mhm yeah they were eating bugs and you know all different testicles from cows and stuff like that and oh 

517.83 519.32 A: (( [mn] )) 

522.72 525.06 A: right [laughter] no that's okay 

524.65 526.66 B: [laughter] 

525.60 529.96 A: i'd rather stick to the other ones like uh joe millionaire and stuff where they don't eat those things 

528.06 531.45 B: (( yeah [laughter] i know [laughter] )) 

530.80 533.16 A: [laughter] that is so disgusting 

532.56 540.36 B: mhm yeah and then people would try out for that you know want to be a contestant on that and try to win money on that 

537.49 538.47 A: right 

540.39 546.28 B: but those were seemed like young kids not young kids but younger people not so much um 

545.69 550.94 A: did you see the one that she told the other girls she had a boyfriend and she was only there for the money 

551.06 552.72 B: (( oh no i didn't see that )) 

551.82 557.87 A: that was on joe millionaire one of the girls that were in the first beginning of the episode she said she was only there for the money 

557.31 559.26 B: oh really oh 

558.06 562.34 A: yeah but she whispered i think at night but i don't think she knew it was being taped 

561.71 562.70 B: uh-huh 

562.44 566.40 A: and then they found out and they basically threw her off the uh off the show [laughter] 

565.67 568.19 B: oh wow 

567.98 569.26 A: that was funny 

568.58 569.74 B: gee 

569.90 575.57 B: yeah 'cause i guess they can do that you know i guess they put you through a [lipsmack] um you know 

574.51 577.71 A: like a test or or at least you got a sign probably something 

577.25 586.59 B: yeah probably a screening process and stuff because otherwise you know people would just be lying that was just like the recent one that they did for um 

578.85 580.76 A: (( mm yeah )) 

587.17 591.31 B: [lipsmack] uh american idol where you know they found out that that one guy 

589.46 593.12 A: oh somebody had a a record or something yeah 

591.67 599.89 B: yeah yeah see 'cause they didn't disclose it you know they have to disclose that stuff and and if they didn't then they'd have 

595.10 596.47 A: right
