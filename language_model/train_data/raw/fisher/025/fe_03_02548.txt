10.87 13.26 B: (( what do you think of reality shows )) 

13.55 19.99 A: reality television i think it's got a mass appeal because ah it's relatively new 

20.12 31.40 A: [noise] and ah people really like the reality i guess they're tired of you know watching the same old actors and actresses on the screen what do you think about that 

28.71 29.72 B: yeah 

31.11 32.14 B: (( yeah um )) 

33.56 34.73 B: (( i )) 

37.54 39.64 B: i um 

40.26 43.17 B: i've watched some of 'em 

43.79 48.92 B: i watched joe millionaire and the survivor show 

49.62 51.57 A: right 

50.29 52.27 B: and um 

53.96 56.89 B: i sort of liked the joe millionaire show 

57.60 61.46 A: yeah why was that was it really funny or 

62.09 64.00 B: well it was sort of 

64.66 66.10 B: decent 

66.87 69.93 B: and but i think this um 

71.08 75.57 B: ah survivor show is sort of dirty 

76.22 84.83 A: [noise] survivor yeah i think it's ah it's got its days numbered i think it lost popularity by a long shot over the other shows 

84.98 86.08 B: yeah 

84.99 94.88 A: um 'cause they seem to be pushing the envelope even further i don't know if you've noticed but with fear factor the kind of stuff that goes on there it's really pushing the envelope 

94.71 96.19 B: right 

97.02 100.26 B: eating worms and whatnot 

97.12 98.80 A: (( yeah )) 

99.55 101.87 A: right right 

103.70 107.41 A: yeah um so what are the shows you like [noise] 

108.20 111.16 B: well i like to watch movies 

112.75 117.87 B: we get cable and i can have my choice of um 

118.17 120.71 B: h._b._o. cinemax 

121.40 123.77 B: showtime and the movie channel 

124.11 126.65 A: great where do you see um 

126.72 132.76 A: the the future of reality television do you you think it's kind of ah 

133.48 139.00 A: you know gain more appeal get more popular or it'll kind of fizzle out 

137.11 141.32 B: (( i think it'll be i think it'll sort of fizzle out )) 

141.15 145.82 A: yeah that's what i think too um because you could never have 

146.07 153.57 A: 'cause people like you know th- they i guess they get they they tire quickly of the same thing 

152.84 154.21 B: right 

154.63 160.40 A: like you know survivor was like really huge and you know it you would see it in 

159.20 162.19 B: we watched that big brother show 

162.24 168.13 A: yeah yeah yeah shows like that are not coming back i mean it's just not happening 

165.53 166.59 B: yeah 

167.78 169.06 B: yeah 

169.56 170.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

171.19 185.88 A: yeah i hear the ah the actors guild and all these other um organizations have a big ah problem with reality television because of actors th- ah they're not getting jobs or 

185.76 189.42 A: acting gigs what do you think about that 

188.03 191.80 B: some of those reality shows have actors in 'em 

191.63 195.76 A: yeah yeah that's that's that's another topic i was gonna bring up too 

195.95 208.35 A: um what do you think ah like for example you mentioned joe millionaire do you think actual joe millionaire was an actor or was it scripted or do you think it's all based on 

207.08 210.20 B: well he has been an actor one time hasn't he 

208.55 213.40 A: i'm i'm yeah do you think it's based on spont- spontaneity or 

213.71 215.50 A: or is it scripted 

214.15 217.55 B: i think some of that is is rehearsed 

217.55 219.41 A: yeah 

218.17 222.05 B: some of his speeches to the girls 

222.53 227.90 B: i think he was pre- those were prepared by hand by the crew or some 

228.15 229.56 B: (( scriptwriter )) 

228.23 229.31 A: yeah i 

229.68 240.58 A: i think so too 'cause the produ- the producers you know if they see that the show is not going so well it's going as exciting as it should be i think they do manipulate and step in 

237.73 238.64 B: yeah 

240.72 243.93 A: in order to make it more interesting you know 

243.25 244.29 B: right 

244.53 246.73 B: they probably do that 

247.35 253.02 A: yeah well i i've heard of ah 

249.49 250.05 B: (( [mn] )) 

253.03 258.14 A: ah reality television diversifying now i don't know if you've heard about the real cancun

259.21 266.71 A: the latest movie the the real cancun it's a movie that just came out about ah ca- about spring break

269.11 270.28 A: well 

269.14 270.18 B: (( spring break )) 

270.49 276.54 A: yeah there's it's like the very first ah reality movie 

276.93 278.39 B: yeah 

276.99 283.45 A: it's like it it's from the from the same people that brought you know the real world and all those other shows [noise] 

282.96 284.50 B: (( yeah [cough] )) 

284.71 285.85 A: so 

286.15 289.94 A: i think it's diversifying in that way into film

315.39 317.03 B: i don't think it's here 

317.60 318.36 A: (( mm ))

322.76 327.75 B: and ah they brought home a list of the movies and that wasn't one of them 

327.77 329.47 A: (( right )) 

329.03 331.80 B: (( yeah ))

348.06 349.05 B: yeah 

353.57 361.20 A: like some of the things that that were on the movie were you know predetermined to work out in a certain way 

359.32 360.13 B: yeah 

360.77 362.07 B: yeah 

361.49 364.85 A: in ord- for the entertainment value you know [lipsmack] 

363.88 365.21 B: yeah 

365.57 374.55 A: um or else you know 'cause you have to think about it it would take a lot of time in the cutting room floor to come up with those gems you know those precious 

374.36 375.40 B: yeah 

374.49 387.13 A: you know funny moments or you know dramatic moments but i i think i think it's a lot easier if they're just scripted and you know kind of manipulated by the producers or directors et cetera [noise] 

378.22 379.65 B: right 

386.66 388.37 B: right 

388.55 390.53 A: yeah
