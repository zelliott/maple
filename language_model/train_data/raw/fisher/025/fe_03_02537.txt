541.33 544.21 B: giving us more and more and more and more 

544.18 556.27 A: well i think people got a little tired of what the t._v. was and then the first reality show came in and boom that was different so everybody watched it and then they just flooded it and people will get sick of it and will look for something else 

550.11 551.92 B: right 

552.61 553.90 B: yeah 

555.87 560.94 B: yeah they do that a lot as soon as ah one thing hits they 

561.14 574.84 B: just god they you know go go go and then it'll die off but it's been a few years now that the whole reality thing has been going on but it actually it seemed like m._t._v. started it with ah 

575.07 580.72 B: with the real world but real t._v. didn't pick up on it for like years 

576.11 577.21 A: yeah 

580.10 581.11 A: yeah 

581.30 585.93 B: and then finally someone did a reality you know regular t._v. show 

586.24 590.79 B: and now they're doing the reality movie which is something about cancun
