7.50 13.44 B: okay i'm sorry uh did you understand what our topic was to be about today 

12.79 17.33 A: yeah i think they asked uh what we think about what's going on in iraq and what 

17.39 21.35 A: what we think should be done or how involved we think the u._s. should be 

21.09 32.47 B: the only thing i got was something about arms maybe and and so i really wasn't sure on the on the total topic but anyway iraq is a good subject right now 

24.37 25.49 A: oh really 

31.92 33.27 A: yeah 

32.54 34.55 B: how do you feel about the war 

34.24 44.45 A: oh dear i don't know it seems really abstract to me because i don't see any of it going on so it's kind of hard hard to formulate an opinion about it what do you think 

43.87 46.42 B: you mean because you're in the u._s. 

46.09 52.36 A: yeah and i mean i don't see the sh- soldiers i don't see you know the whole issue so 

46.58 47.58 B: mhm 

49.01 51.14 B: right right 

51.58 53.78 B: i'm in oklahoma where are you 

53.21 54.76 A: i'm in massachussetts 

54.41 55.71 B: okay 

55.95 59.62 B: [cough] well i know when ninety nine one one happened 

58.98 59.74 A: [noise] 

59.79 60.79 A: mhm 

59.98 67.39 B: uh it made me more aware of how people in other countries live on a day to day basis you 

67.65 73.00 B: know like in in israel where they have bombings uh it's an every day occurrence 

72.31 73.40 A: (( mhm right )) 

73.10 78.39 B: and i thought golly how do those people live like that every day 

77.89 79.32 A: (( right )) 

78.86 82.02 B: but i don't know that um 

82.06 85.25 B: it it really opened a lot of eyes i think 

84.90 86.04 A: yeah 

85.49 88.45 B: we we're so fortunate in our country 

88.15 89.29 A: yeah 

88.86 92.95 B: we've always been blessed to live in peace and freedom and 

93.07 97.56 B: but i don't know on the arms do you think they will find uh 

97.66 101.34 B: what are your feelings on their finding any weapons of of 

100.45 104.07 A: well i'm not really sure but i can't help but wonder why 

104.17 105.20 A: um 

105.29 109.05 A: why we're so opposed to killing here but um 

109.08 121.87 A: as as i've been hearing on the news um what's going on in iraq is murder of innocent civilians also so it seems like they pick and choose and decide what what we should you know protect you know 

121.53 122.56 B: mhm 

121.98 123.18 A: and um 

123.43 126.75 A: it's more the president that we're supposed to support than 

126.77 130.55 A: what we believe our country stands for sometimes you know 

128.46 132.68 B: mhm do you think we should not have went to war at all 

132.22 138.27 A: um you see that's because that's what they said before which is it's hard for me to know because i really don't i'm not 

138.28 144.23 A: you know involved in the real stuff of what's going on so it's kinda like my opinion isn't based on anything 

140.80 141.90 B: mhm 

143.80 144.93 B: mhm 

144.39 145.78 A: substantial you know 

145.57 153.77 B: well you can look at both sides of the issue and see pros and cons you know on both sides when you listen to 

150.35 151.19 A: mm 

154.60 169.09 B: to all the details on the news reports and of course no one ever likes to see innocent people hurt i mean that goes against everything that anybody stands for i think that any anybody that's decent 

157.01 157.93 A: (( right yes )) 

168.52 169.88 A: (( yeah right )) 

169.25 174.83 B: but no one wants that but that's the sad thing about in in war 

175.16 176.96 B: not only are 

176.97 187.27 B: innocent people hurt and killed but our own people are also hurt and killed so it's a sacrifice we have to pay for for freedom 

183.30 184.51 A: right 

187.25 188.51 A: yeah 

187.88 189.60 B: it it's hard 

189.00 199.90 A: it seems so barbaric to go in though and be violent when our whole point is to not be violent you know our the whole problem is that we think the issue of our being violent i mean 

200.99 205.43 A: it attacking people in the same way that you feel they're attacking attacking you 

205.11 206.37 B: mhm 

205.60 209.61 A: just elicits more violence from those people you know [noise] 

209.08 223.06 B: mhm it would be nice if we could live in a world where everyone was at peace and got along and loved each other but you know what it's it's it's this is the real world that we're in it's not a 

214.14 215.03 A: (( yeah )) 

223.30 224.62 B: it's not heaven 

224.29 225.24 A: yeah 

225.59 231.52 B: so i think we're always going to have that i mean that's just part of life we have to accept that 

231.72 236.58 B: bad things are going to happen and we have to do the best we can do with it 

233.87 234.64 A: (( yeah yeah i )) 

236.91 240.01 A: guess it's also sort of shaded over by 

240.14 247.51 A: um other motives for the administration to go in besides finding weapons like the oil 

247.17 248.14 B: mhm 

247.55 248.52 A: um 

248.73 251.19 A: and it makes you wonder because his father also 

251.34 252.16 A: uh 

252.27 255.96 A: invaded iraq um back in the early nineties so 

255.28 256.40 B: mhm 

256.42 260.55 A: it sort of makes the connection in your mind about ulterior motives 

260.14 261.23 B: well 

261.59 266.66 B: you may have those thoughts and and i don't know that's 

268.00 270.17 B: i had thoughts about 

270.76 274.08 B: whether we should even go into it or not at the beginning 

274.51 275.71 B: but 

276.03 285.10 B: the way it's been handled i have great respect for the way they took so much care in trying to avoid hitting 

285.11 296.16 B: you know when they were just bombing where they thought the the main uh part of his army was and tried to avoid the civilian population 

292.09 293.89 A: mhm right i mean 

295.82 296.72 A: (( yes )) 

296.41 301.14 B: and they could do that and that was amazing and i really admired that 

300.53 306.04 A: yeah i mean they could definitely be more violent than they are which is which is good that they're not being violent 

301.51 302.28 B: so 

304.57 310.26 B: uh-huh right i i try to look at the good that's going to come out of it it 

306.26 307.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

310.27 315.60 B: the people over there now seem to be the majority of them seem to be happy 

315.64 323.01 B: and ready for a change and peace and so we have to focus on that i think you know what what they want 

318.01 318.87 A: mhm 

322.42 330.29 A: that's true see i mean it's not that it's not as though we're really going to change what what the administration has decided so you might as well be optimistic about it 

329.73 334.03 B: mhm we might as well and i think good will come out of it 

333.53 334.29 A: (( mm )) 

334.56 338.88 B: just pray and give it to god and he will take care of it 

339.79 353.30 B: but [sigh] i don't know uh i just hope those people have a better life than they've had it seems like they have been so downtrodden and and with little hope and little chance and i know their own people have come over here 

350.56 351.42 A: yeah 

353.55 361.69 B: to learn and now maybe they will take that back and you know like the doctors here i've seen so many of them that are here 

358.99 359.90 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

361.28 361.98 A: mm 

362.04 367.00 B: and maybe they will go back now and and help build their land and 

366.35 367.10 A: mm 

367.26 368.50 B: (( i don't know [lipsmack] )) 

368.09 369.32 A: yeah 

368.76 375.67 B: i just want the country to to be a happy free country and i would like for us all to live in peace 

372.42 373.79 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

375.16 376.50 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

376.93 379.48 B: do you think that might ever happen [sigh] 

378.99 391.20 A: um i don't know it seems like throughout history we've never really had i mean right even if there's a time of peace it's like a cycle you know and war inevitably comes it's like human nature you know 

382.42 384.25 B: never really have we 

387.01 388.04 B: mhm 

389.57 390.79 B: right 

391.28 402.91 B: you know i thought after our last major war that we would never again see a war because of the nuclear possiblity and i thought well there will never be another war again 

391.70 392.63 A: [noise] 

395.48 397.39 A: mhm right 

398.86 399.91 A: right 

402.41 407.51 A: right because as soon as you bring up conflict like that there's you always run the risk 

406.53 407.74 B: mhm 

407.92 411.21 B: so now we have to worry about um 

411.52 412.96 B: north korea 

413.30 415.01 B: and what they might do 

413.36 414.68 A: (( [noise] right )) 

414.82 415.70 A: yeah 

415.97 419.39 B: with their weapons and i don't know but 

417.15 418.68 A: yeah 

420.22 420.78 A: (( [mn] )) 

420.39 421.59 B: anyway 

422.41 423.95 B: well [sigh] 

424.54 429.93 B: you bring up something now thi this is fun for me what about you 

426.04 427.02 A: um 

427.85 429.09 A: yeah 

429.34 431.66 A: yeah this is the second time i've called so 

431.19 434.04 B: mine too it's my second one 

432.00 432.94 A: yeah

440.22 441.61 B: mhm 

441.78 443.23 A: (( [noise] um )) 

442.40 447.91 B: which but uh i don't know this this seems to touch the hearts of people deeper 

447.50 448.42 A: (( right )) 

448.18 449.23 B: so 

449.65 450.63 B: (( [cough] ))

462.39 465.47 A: what did he out- what was his main point 

465.66 473.48 B: just the parts that got uh just about the war and about the freedom for the iraqi people 

473.00 474.42 A: (( mhm right )) 

473.50 483.02 B: and where we're going from here hopefully and that's what we all want is peace you know i think everyone has to want that
