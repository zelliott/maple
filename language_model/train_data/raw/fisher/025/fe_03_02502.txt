223.20 224.14 A: uh-huh 

223.54 230.10 B: and they asked him if he would like to be on change of heart and he didn't even have a girlfriend and they had a girlfriend there for him like it was staged 

228.93 230.25 A: oh my god 

230.35 232.01 A: so it's totally 

230.42 231.41 B: and he 

232.12 235.03 A: it's totally like it it's not real then 

234.64 243.88 B: no it was like and so he was deciding who to stay with between two people that he didn't know it wasn't like it was the girlfriend [mn] for a long time and then some other person off the street it was like 

243.92 246.78 B: two people that he didn't know and one of them he was pretending 

247.10 249.56 B: was his girlfriend for a long time [noise] 

249.26 251.31 A: huh that's interesting 

249.99 250.71 B: and i 

250.78 257.72 B: i was like upset to hear that 'cause i didn't i thought it was [laughter] at least that part of it was real that the contestants were really dating 

252.45 253.61 A: yeah 

257.65 261.63 A: yeah that's kind of ridiculous i wonder [mn] 

259.74 262.98 B: so i wonder how many of them are really like that 

262.63 277.60 A: yeah well i know um [lipsmack] my room mate like uh this guy that she's friends with um one of his like friends from high school's um brother i think was one of the contestants on the bachelorette 

277.51 291.02 A: and i know that um [lipsmack] he wasn't allowed to like no one was allowed to talk about it i mean they they weren't allowed to say anything about it so and i don't know how he originally got on the show i mean they probably have like a casting or something but 

290.96 297.20 A: for that i mean it just seemed like since they had to keep it so quiet about it that it was actually you know but that it 

294.44 295.67 B: (( [noise] right )) 

296.06 299.33 B: yeah you're wondering why they had to keep quiet 

298.70 301.56 A: yeah that's true too [laughter] 

300.01 301.27 B: yeah 

301.63 302.76 B: i don't know

319.22 321.05 A: oh like [mn] like 

321.38 327.01 A: like what marry a millionaire or something like that yeah that was like one of the very first 

322.88 325.32 B: yeah that one that one 

327.42 330.90 B: and he had this really bad past and stuff that 

327.46 328.63 A: versions

332.25 333.57 A: yeah 

335.22 336.91 A: wait and what she wa- 

335.50 336.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

337.26 339.37 A: someone was ma- what did you say 

338.93 346.74 B: that he had like a bad past like he was stalking his ex-girlfriend or something like that and she didn't know about it until she was already married to him 

343.61 344.60 A: oh 

346.48 349.13 A: and then they ended up getting divorced too right 

348.11 350.38 B: yeah she didn't even wanna be near him 

349.92 358.53 A: [laughter] it's so ridiculous [laughter] i guess the one good thing now that comes out of it is getting famous if they do [laughter] 

351.25 353.13 B: so i don't know what these people 

357.80 359.26 B: right right 

359.27 363.00 A: although i don't know how many of them become that famous but 

362.68 363.82 B: no 

363.47 366.85 A: i don't know they're just all starting to seem the same now 

367.26 372.10 B: yeah it's not as good like you were saying before when it's a n- something's new 

372.17 373.43 A: yeah 

372.82 379.70 B: then you really wanna see it but now it's kind of like every th- every show that you turn on is a reality show so 

379.42 388.88 A: yeah and like the real word like i haven't watched it lately i saw a couple of episodes last season which i think was when they were in vegas 

388.45 389.34 B: right 

388.75 403.17 A: and uh it just didn't really interest me that much anymore because it felt like the people on the show like are you know kind of like try to i don't know like act like act and also act like maybe they try to you know what the original shows were like 

395.86 396.73 B: act 

402.50 404.25 B: right [noise] [noise] 

403.10 409.92 A: there's just like there's no more originality left in it you know because it's like i don't want more 

405.40 406.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

409.74 410.67 A: like 

410.48 415.55 A: it's just like the same stuff happens all the time like the people in the house hook up and like 

415.36 426.54 A: you know like or like there's always someone with an attitude problem you know there's someone that has to be like the the troublemaker like it's just like i don't know it just gots to be the same stuff 

419.56 420.67 B: right 

425.96 429.54 B: well do you ever watch when there's a like a reunion of those shows 

429.43 431.66 A: when there's a what oh a reunion 

430.25 440.31 B: they have like the reunion like and it always seems like there was so much cut out that happened that would've made for more interesting t._v. but i guess they didn't want to show it for some reason 

431.73 433.04 A: yeah 

440.18 446.64 A: yeah that's weird 'cause i mean i know that they do cut out a lot but i thought that they they cut things out just to make 

446.45 459.65 A: you know things more interesting i thought they cut out the boring parts i think they also they they cut things and they put things together to like skew things you know what i mean like to create what might seem like just something like juicy 

454.72 456.63 B: right yeah 

459.15 460.89 B: [noise] and it's not really 

460.52 461.97 A: exactly 

461.35 462.78 B: yeah [noise] 

462.20 472.61 A: and actually i saw one of those um i was visiting a friend at um [lipsmack] who went to syracuse a few years ago and they had the the people from one of the casts um 

472.65 481.48 A: i don't remember which cast it was but it was one of the very first ones um and they were you know just talking about it and stuff and they said that it was totally like 

481.56 487.28 A: you know skewed like i said like they're they said there were so many things that happened that like 

486.27 489.15 B: so they come off looking terrible [noise] 

488.32 494.26 A: exactly [laughter] it's like it's like the people on the sh- it's like you know the producer's like 

490.03 490.98 B: (( oh )) 

494.37 504.45 A: not that they instigate but it's like they i- it's like what you know reporters do when like they interview someone you know like they take things like out of context kind of 

500.54 501.66 B: right 

503.86 510.71 B: well no one wants to sit and watch like these five people that get along with each other all the time [laughter] and nothing happens you know 

507.99 509.66 A: and exactly that could 

509.83 517.27 A: exactly yeah that's what they have to do i guess to have an audience and get good ratings that's the whole that's the game [laughter] 

516.21 522.48 B: well i think there's a new one on something about i think it's called high school reunion or something like that 

521.43 524.83 A: [sigh] i heard about that one too [laughter] 

524.32 528.67 B: [noise] i don't know about that [laughter] i didn't see it 

524.91 525.88 A: did you s- 

526.28 528.02 A: did you see uh 

528.08 529.80 A: is it on yet or 

529.38 533.32 B: [noise] i'm not even sure i just remember hearing about that 

532.99 536.92 A: yeah i think that's a pretty interesting concept i mean 

537.01 542.60 A: like i don't know to see people go back you know like to see like what they've become and stuff 

537.46 538.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

541.91 544.80 B: [noise] i mean i think it would be good to see like 

544.96 553.51 B: [lipsmack] someone who was like made [laughter] fun of or something in school like comes back and they're like something really good and that kind [laughter] that whole kind of 

547.67 548.71 A: yeah 

553.39 554.82 A: yeah 

554.20 555.48 B: story line 

555.23 567.32 A: which is probably like what they i mean there's probably like one of those people and then there's probably like someone that was like you know a jock like a really popular jock or something who's like a loser now [laughter] or 

565.37 566.52 B: yeah 

566.56 573.39 B: or like they wanted to date when they were in high school but now but they never did and now they're finally getting together or something [noise] 

572.59 587.18 A: yeah exactly but they even have like they they've had some similar stuff like that on talk shows you know like i've definitely seen stuff like that on when you know people come on you know like ricki lake or whatever any show like that and and uh 

587.14 588.06 A: they're 

588.11 592.36 A: you know like they went to high school together and one's one that got made fun of or or 

591.61 593.34 B: mhm 

592.65 594.27 A: whatever [laughter] 

594.13 599.79 B: i always like to see the [mn] the reactions of the people who used to like be the bullies or whatever 

599.04 599.89 A: (( yeah it ))
