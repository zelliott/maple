12.56 14.20 B: yes 

14.13 16.72 A: so do you watch the reality shows 

14.25 15.29 B: um 

16.04 20.71 B: you know the only one i watched was the bachelorette how 'bout you 

20.36 24.29 A: the only one that i watched was the first original survivor 

24.08 26.84 B: oh really and how what did you think of that 

26.14 37.24 A: [noise] i really kind of got interested in the first one but then after that when they came on with a second one it was like okay i saw the first one it i'm not interested anymore 

36.83 38.01 B: yeah 

37.39 41.07 A: and the other ones i just don't really i haven't gotten into 

41.16 42.15 B: uh-huh 

41.29 43.00 A: how 'bout how 'bout you 

42.73 52.32 B: well i watched the first um program of survivor and i couldn't stomach the bugs when they 

51.44 53.00 A: [laughter] 

52.59 60.65 B: when they started to eat bugs i said this is not for me and so i didn't turn it on again [laughter] yeah 

56.14 57.46 A: [laughter] 

59.99 61.43 A: [laughter] that's funny 

61.82 69.09 A: well see that's what gets me about some of them uh its going into shock t._v. now as opposed to 

69.34 73.08 A: i think what the reality shows are they're no longer 

73.51 82.83 A: about real people it's just to shock the audience and i think half the people that um try out for these shows are wannabe movie stars anyway 

82.43 89.16 B: mm and some of them are i mean they you know as they uh i agree with you in the uh 

89.17 92.52 B: that just to get reactions from 

92.54 93.71 B: uh 

94.30 96.51 B: the people but i 

96.85 108.03 B: am one that um as a rea- to live to watch someone in a in a reality situation 

108.27 116.91 B: it it it doesn't interest me and and i guess the reason that the bachelorette interests me was the hype 

116.92 119.26 B: from the promotions 

119.41 120.76 A: oh okay 

120.38 123.74 B: and but the survivor um 

124.00 132.03 B: [lipsmack] i could not get into even though i i heard you know that that there was hype and um 

129.89 130.79 A: mhm 

132.42 133.65 B: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

133.67 136.99 B: it is something that i um 

137.26 139.02 B: i i've just even 

139.81 145.88 B: the movie stars that have reality shows i i can't it does not interest me 

145.30 154.23 A: i can't get into those either the i to my mind it's not reality because if you were to put a camera in my house for twenty fours 

154.12 155.36 B: mhm 

154.68 156.77 A: you would be pretty bored 

156.20 157.74 B: absolutely 

157.22 160.87 A: and i think that they're just manufacturing a lot of it 

160.98 164.97 A: and they're making money there's a there's an advertiser and they're making money 

164.67 165.79 B: (( mhm )) 

166.08 172.69 B: now i must admit in the evenings when i am surfing through the channels 

172.79 174.65 B: and um 

175.54 178.65 B: i can't recall her name now but she has 

179.19 180.75 B: anna nicole 

181.16 182.67 A: (( oh yes [laughter] [noise] )) 

182.80 197.40 B: [mn] you know and and i will briefly watch that and shake my head and go [laughter] go on you know because uh it it seems like to me that might may be reality for her but how many 

198.35 203.75 B: celebrities even i mean that's not reality t._v. 

203.26 210.87 A: right uh i think that you probably do the same thing that i'm doing you as you say you're surfing something catches your eye 

210.37 211.61 B: mhm 

210.88 212.55 A: and then it goes from 

213.16 216.48 A: from what you [mn] what was interesting to the ridiculous 

215.92 217.36 B: absolutely 

216.98 220.81 A: or i think the um [sigh] oh the ozzy um 

220.83 222.29 B: the osbourne's 

220.86 221.43 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

221.68 222.79 A: osbourne 

222.44 223.61 B: mhm 

222.99 227.42 A: sometimes i've watched that until it's so much bleeping out 

227.93 233.42 A: that it's like [laughter] you're missing half the sentence because everything is bleeped out 

232.86 238.26 B: mhm you're right and i i did not i don't believe i 

238.87 250.42 B: i even saw any of that i it was very sad her situation and i u- understand that the show you know when she did uh get the cancer that they did not 

251.03 255.80 B: i i don't know if if they continued the reality show during that period or not mm 

255.20 270.09 A: they did because they were sometime they were uh people magazine i think showed or some place i was reading that she was actually being uh somebody was following her while she was in the doctor's office going through some of the therapies and and that type of thing 

269.11 270.58 B: (( mhm )) 

270.14 274.64 A: but she's being paid millions to do this 

274.28 275.57 B: mhm 

274.95 277.58 A: not even thousands millions 

276.93 278.76 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

278.08 280.80 A: i guess people will do anything for money 

280.55 282.30 B: yeah yeah 

281.45 283.18 A: that's what it boils down to 

283.07 284.38 B: that's true 

284.64 286.76 B: and i um 

287.91 294.22 B: i i don't recall any other reality shows that i have even 

294.74 300.10 B: um observed i'm um trying to think through 

300.83 303.17 B: some of them it's either 

302.17 307.36 A: well i think the original one didn't it originally start with m._t._v. wasn't 

306.77 309.77 B: that's true i remember that now 

308.20 309.03 A: and 

309.30 312.13 A: and [sigh] [lipsmack] i'm just trying to think 

312.99 316.80 A: i guess they had a group of people that either lived together or 

317.12 319.21 B: oh was it the big brother 

319.46 320.99 B: was that one of them 

320.36 330.97 A: that no i mean the one on m._t._v. how i think how the reality started was with m._t._v. where they had people living together and then yes you're right there was a big big brother one 

325.66 327.03 B: oh okay 

331.01 332.02 B: uh-huh 

331.57 335.29 A: um that wasn't m._t._v. that was a regular station 

334.98 340.34 B: now i believe that show originated in britain did it not 

339.81 341.03 A: yes 

341.06 342.44 A: yes uh 

341.46 344.11 B: and i know it was quite popular there 

343.79 347.58 A: who wants to be a millionaire i believe uh originated 

347.59 348.94 B: right 

348.29 349.80 A: over there also 

349.35 354.98 B: right yeah yeah but i the the reality shows 

355.14 361.60 B: did they i i think they did originate from britain and then we then they came over here 

361.00 362.38 A: mhm 

361.72 364.40 B: and um and they are 

364.54 367.10 B: proving to be quite popular 

367.12 368.33 A: oh yes 

368.37 369.82 B: and um 

370.01 371.82 B: so [mn] um 

372.31 373.65 B: i was 

374.27 377.70 B: [mn] i'm interested to know in um 

378.28 380.59 B: is it the bachelorette 

381.68 389.26 B: that's what i watched was the bachelorette the not the bachelor it was the bachelorette with the i think that was tristan and ryan 

389.65 391.67 B: is that right do you remember 

390.67 393.87 A: see i don't i don't think i followed that one at all

401.82 402.69 A: mhm 

402.76 406.42 B: and uh to see who she would choose 

406.50 410.23 B: and [mn] there for a while i guess they were 

410.52 416.51 B: uh planning a marriage and so forth but then i i just read where 

417.43 421.45 B: they had broken up but that's you know i again
