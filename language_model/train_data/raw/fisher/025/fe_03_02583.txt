101.90 105.14 B: yeah that's what they're gonna have to do some time in the future 

106.32 111.23 B: right now i think the people would be happy just to be ge- get rid of saddam hussein 

111.53 115.00 A: yeah that's that's the m- most important thing right now 

116.11 125.21 B: so i think it is important what's going on over there but i think a lot of the they already already some of the troops are coming home so that's good 

125.35 127.41 A: (( yeah )) 

128.01 131.17 A: yeah we need them to come home safe and everything 

130.54 137.70 B: yeah we just and another thing we need to make sure that that the people that that are put in charge over there are 

138.01 144.04 B: are better than w- the people that was there because you never know how how the new people are gonna be 

144.13 150.05 A: yeah well we wanna good leader we don't want like you know [mn] [noise] 

148.95 157.76 B: yeah there's there's i mean there's other people that that are waiting in there they might be the same as hussein all they want is the power they don't care about the people 

157.86 160.57 A: yeah we need somebody that actually cares about [noise] 

160.86 163.12 A: their country and [noise] 

162.07 163.55 B: that's right 

165.91 171.13 B: so now that the war is over pretty fast that things went pretty well so now you 

171.35 180.28 B: i think that now they're more con- the united states is concerned of what about what the whole world is thinking and and we need to make sure that 

180.48 187.44 B: that things are taken care of and that that somebody else doesn't come in and just try to take over for the oil and the money 

187.39 194.01 A: how do you think um yeah how do you think clinton would have dealt with what the s- the same situation do you think they'd of went to war in iraq 

193.42 196.49 B: uh i don't think so i think he would have he would 

196.91 198.87 B: have tried to um 

199.54 201.60 B: maybe just just uh 

201.70 204.03 B: buy his way out or something 

204.44 205.21 A: mm 

204.69 207.60 B: maybe give give hussein something just to 

207.66 214.54 B: to to keep him happy he would've thought of that if he could keep him happy then he didn't have to worry about any kinda 

214.70 216.40 B: terrorist attack 

216.46 220.92 A: so do you think that bush deal with it um right or not real good or no 

220.70 224.29 B: yeah well i'm i i think it is because 

224.33 237.02 B: a- all these people it's like it's like they find out now that all of 'em were all the people being tortured and killed and it makes me think of like hitler during world war two what he did 

237.17 238.75 B: and so like all these 

238.80 243.60 A: [mn] i think bush he's wanted the um the oil that's what i think he wants 

243.45 244.46 B: yeah 

244.46 249.04 A: that's what i yeah i think that's the main reason why he went to war i mean 

247.83 259.21 B: i don't know i i can't tell but i would it seems to me that that you would think that that that they would know more about it than i do with the f._b._i. and the c._i._a. 

259.18 264.06 B: that they have more intelligence and and that they were more worried about uh 

264.09 266.51 B: attack on the united states 

266.46 268.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm yeah )) 

268.05 282.49 B: 'cause although they never found any of these weapons that they said or they never found any of this poison i don't know i saw somebody the other day who said well yeah they did find it but they don't wanna tell us i don't know why they would wouldn't wanna tell us because that's so 

282.49 288.10 B: one of the reasons they said they were going there was to try to find these weapons of mass destruction 

288.06 296.52 A: well they wan- they probably don't wanna scare us they probably they probably haven't found the weapons uh the uh nuclear weapons and all that but they probably found maybe i don't know 

296.88 305.48 A: maybe um some of the soldiers may have encountered a you know like attack for like um for and something that they had 

304.87 306.00 B: yeah 

306.24 307.48 A: (( like um )) 

308.06 309.05 A: (( i'm not sure )) 

308.10 315.11 B: i don't know it just seems to me that they w- if they found 'em they would want the world to know that they were there and that that like 

315.30 318.60 B: the attacking iraq was justified 

319.11 328.57 B: but i don't know how somebody somebody said well oh yeah they found 'em but the but the government wants doesn't want us to know well how does that person know what makes that person so smart 

328.56 338.14 B: i don't know it just seems to me that the people don't trust the government any more and and and no matter what the government says everybody's gonna say well they don't believe 'em 

338.69 339.47 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

338.90 340.44 B: i think that what they 

340.48 342.96 B: all the people i mean you saw the 

343.16 351.72 B: if you saw on television i mean when the united states when they were coming into iraq the people on the all the citizens standing and cheering i mean it 

351.83 354.89 B: it made me feel good that we were helping these people 

355.34 368.28 A: yeah well sometimes you gotta watch out 'cause like they they could look like they're innocent bystanders but i've seen i mean i heard the little kids they go they they are trained to like kill like to kill themselves to kill americans [noise] [noise] 

366.78 368.42 B: yeah i know that too 

368.72 379.35 B: but sometimes um or like when they when they're pulling down the statues and things they were happy like when it happened but then later on once uh 

379.62 391.85 B: the looting started and everything they were all of sudden they're you know they're angry with the united states they want they think the united states is gonna is gonna be in charge over there instead of electing somebody to 

392.12 396.55 B: to be their representative so they're angry about that right now 

394.58 395.37 A: (( mm )) 

397.56 405.75 A: so what do you think the united states is gonna do do you think they're gonna take over themselves they're gonna let their own country somebody from their own country take over and like [noise] [noise] 

404.05 411.56 B: no i don't think the united states is gonna take over they want i think they want somebody else but they have to be careful because there's just a lot of uh 

412.56 420.83 B: there's a lot of religious fanatics over there who i'm sure would love to be in charge like even people from other countries like syria iran 

420.90 424.56 B: they wan that wanna already they wanna move in there and take over 

423.04 424.68 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

424.95 427.48 B: so they see where see where it's a big 

427.53 436.60 B: a big power thing and and the big thing over there i think is the oil you have to be careful because somebody moves in there and all they see is all the money 

436.83 445.55 B: that that hussein has from all this oil and and that's all they can see is how they're gonna be be real rich just like he was 

445.39 447.47 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

446.16 457.34 B: i think it's important what's going on over there and the united states needs to watch but i don't i don't think we need to to be over there all the time and and like be in charge because 

457.43 469.72 B: for one thing it's a there's a big difference between the people in the united states and people in the muslim countries they whole they have a whole different different attitude and a whole different heritage that that 

469.89 471.68 B: we're not familiar with 

471.08 472.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] uh [noise] )) 

473.66 475.52 A: [noise] mm yeah 

473.71 474.63 B: so i 

474.75 485.45 B: it's it's important to to get somebody in there that that knows the iraqi people maybe one of these there were some people that left the country because of 

485.25 497.77 B: h- hussein and and get one of get maybe one of those leaders get them to come back but i think it has to be it has to be who the people want because if the people don't support 'em it's going to be the same thing all over again 

497.63 499.95 A: yeah yeah that's true 

500.90 513.63 B: and so i think now that now that it's done in iraq i don't think you have to have to move into other countries i think the united states should should stay there for a while just to make sure that that things are are 

513.72 515.64 B: kept peaceful and then 

515.01 517.30 A: and everything is safe and every- yeah 

516.12 522.30 B: yeah and then and then move out i don't think we need to to keep all the other war 

519.86 521.07 A: [noise] 

522.45 528.92 B: equipment and everything else in there we can move out because otherwise the people are gonna think that we're trying to take over 

529.29 529.90 A: (( uh-huh )) 

530.11 530.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

533.97 541.04 A: well yeah i just i just hope everything's fine over there like 

540.44 549.31 B: yeah well you know and everybody was worried there was gonna be all kinds of terrorist attacks in the united states well there still could be i think the peop- 

548.71 549.84 A: yeah 

549.76 550.83 B: i i 

549.98 555.74 A: because they they kinda moved out right they moved out the country probably the um like all the terrorists from iraq and everything 

555.76 558.95 A: they probably moved out right to another country or something 

558.30 561.48 B: sure they're just waiting on the on the sidelines 

561.59 567.84 B: that's why they can't find all these weapons 'cause they've they had all this time to move 'em out so they're not there but they 

562.45 563.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

567.55 568.16 A: [noise] 

568.14 577.05 B: they still could be around and the the terrorists are still there they haven't been killed and so i think the united states needs to keep their guard up 

577.45 578.26 A: [noise] 

577.82 584.55 B: you start letting everybody you know fly in the airplanes you'll have another another disaster like they had in new york 

580.31 581.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

581.57 582.18 A: [noise] 

584.41 589.82 A: yeah i think that the that was too easy for them the terrorists that was way too easy 

589.26 590.21 B: yeah 

590.27 592.22 A: god i mean hm 

592.38 593.92 B: but now that they 

594.10 598.98 B: the way things are now i think when they keep they keep telling everybody that to 

599.04 599.89 B: (( to be on your ))
