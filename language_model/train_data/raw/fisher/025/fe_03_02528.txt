67.78 69.03 A: mhm 

72.45 77.64 B: that would be quite a surprise because they're meeting under not realistic circumstances 

78.10 87.51 A: well basic- you know there's it seems like uh uh t._v. now i'll i'll see a lot of this uh reality it seems to be coming more and more popular 

87.22 88.34 B: mhm 

88.00 91.78 A: but um i i don't watch a lot of it i just hear about it or 

92.18 98.19 A: [cough] might have caught pieces of it when it first began and that that would be about it for me but 

98.88 100.47 B: yeah i i like 

100.54 105.18 B: i only watched a little bit of that too and i just thought it was everyone kind of

109.05 113.21 B: um just seeing people at their worse you know 'cause they're trying to win [laughter] 

111.56 112.57 A: (( [laughter] )) 

113.14 125.04 A: i know and i i you know what i wonder is people that are doing this reality t._v. they're being seen by millions and millions of people and i'm sure a lot of people know them and can you imagine 

125.20 129.62 A: putting that you know [mn] that face in front of everybody 

129.32 131.03 B: yeah

132.71 140.90 B: well i know and most of us i i talk about this at work too somet- every once in a while and they're like yeah who's going to really think they're going to find the man or the woman or 

140.04 141.25 A: (( [laughter] )) 

140.77 149.29 B: dreams on t._v. you know and it's like well i think they're probably [mn] some of these people not all i got to admit from what i've seen some 

149.15 150.14 A: mhm 

149.39 154.02 B: obviously are doing it for that publicity and you know getting all that attention 

153.82 155.04 A: mhm 

154.21 155.43 B: but um 

155.67 163.03 B: i think people watch it just to kind of feel like they think they're like everything those popular like jerry springer or anything else 

162.42 163.68 A: oh my god 

163.05 167.61 B: it's so's if you're you have a secret into someone's life and 

167.21 168.28 A: mhm 

167.92 176.30 B: um or seeing what people how people react in different situations without supposedly being you know censored or you know 

172.50 173.30 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

176.64 180.52 A: do you think they're the the average american that are doing that though 

181.08 181.97 B: (( uh )) 

182.30 185.74 B: mm it depends i guess on the show 'cause i mean especially like 

185.86 192.26 B: [lipsmack] they're you know like the bachelor and i think the millionaire shows so they're going to try to find you know the 

192.27 196.73 B: upper class or middle well not upperness i mean but middle class america 

196.45 197.53 A: mhm 

196.88 200.18 B: so that's that's who watches it i was joking with um 

200.47 213.22 B: one of the girls saying yeah they should do one for the african americans they should do one for the hispanics so then while i i i know the spanish station 'cause i'm hispanic they they've done some of the reality shows already too so 

204.41 205.90 A: (( yeah )) 

207.70 208.77 A: mhm 

211.71 212.59 A: oh 

212.91 213.82 A: oh 

213.19 224.00 B: it's yeah they've crossed over there too just with mhm they've done like a survivor version and they've done um what is it big brother version 

215.93 217.49 A: i didn't know that 

222.98 224.10 A: oh yeah 

224.00 231.32 B: and something similar to um not the same they kind of change a little bit some of them like similar to um american idol 

231.42 232.38 B: um 

231.70 232.31 A: (( mm )) 

232.65 237.01 B: kind of a [mn] combination american idol with oh what is it 

237.75 240.10 B: uh [mn] um 

240.63 246.58 B: big brother kind of scenario but it's the same it's the same thing they put the pretty girl showing off 

241.90 243.28 A: oh okay 

246.61 248.98 B: nothing changes in t._v. i mean that's 

248.78 250.06 A: mhm 

249.40 253.45 B: sex still is the main sell i think you know and all that 

251.97 253.63 A: yeah or violence 

253.75 259.88 B: or yeah well 'cause the violence would be or the extreme like the there's one fear factor 

258.16 259.39 A: mhm 

259.65 263.97 A: oh yeah yes i've watched that i i 

262.79 266.20 B: yeah i got to admit i watched it a few times too and then [mn] 

265.63 270.36 A: yes i have too it's kind of interesting just to see how far they'll go 

268.29 269.24 B: mhm 

270.12 279.83 B: yeah and i mean these aren't obviously they're picking people that will be able to are you know they're kind of very competitive and they'll try anything 

278.76 280.43 A: mhm 

280.11 287.32 B: so from you can tell by the way they picked them out because if i'd be out it'd be like uh [laughter] i'm out of there [laughter] 

285.02 286.18 A: [lipsmack] you know 

286.57 300.25 A: the um very first survivor show that they the they were having uh they had a newspaper ad out and and uh my mother sent me an application and you had to make your own video and 

299.66 300.91 B: oh yeah 

300.53 314.26 A: but um i had halfway thought about it [mn] at the time i just thought well that'd be kind of interesting but then they were saying there was rats on the [laughter] island and all these different creatures and i i decided you know what i don't want to do that 

314.24 320.15 A: but it was interesting i did actually think about it and i do have still have the application that 

317.53 318.95 B: mhm 

319.60 327.35 B: well that's yeah i've known people that have uh also wanted to do that do the video 'cause they're kind of adventuresome kind of people 

326.66 328.08 A: mhm 

327.67 328.90 B: and um 

329.76 331.59 B: i mean i don't know i think it's 

331.89 345.02 B: it's got it's good and it's bad i think you know you can't take it too seriously and obviously it's kind of it i think it's just a sign of what our society is about the american society is you know being famous 

334.04 335.42 A: mhm 

343.87 345.28 A: i think so too 

345.17 349.74 B: is the thing and now any anyone can possibly become famous 

349.69 350.88 A: that's right 

350.22 356.90 B: and in different ways you know and you just find your niche which one do you think you might be able to get on and if you really want that 

356.91 358.91 A: yes if that is your niche 

357.21 358.02 B: (( um )) 

358.52 363.14 B: mhm yeah and there's some people out there it is but i i mean i like the um 

363.20 368.57 B: the bachelor 'cause i'm single it just kind of that's our little thing [laughter] and we just kind of 

365.70 366.85 A: (( [laughter] )) 

367.40 372.52 A: i haven't seen that i i don't even know what that's about it's it's a lot of bachelors or 

370.27 371.80 B: [sigh] it's uh 

372.10 380.66 B: uh well actually right now it's one bachelor and like it starts with twenty five girls and then he starts eliminating and at the end you know 

377.35 378.39 A: (( oh oh )) 

379.59 383.92 A: oh sort of like the uh guy that got marr- or wanted to get married 

383.38 392.27 B: yeah same idea but it's not so cheesy it's a little bit well there's always gonna be what do you call it like cat fighting and stuff that goes on 

390.84 392.83 A: [lipsmack] oh yeah sure 

392.62 406.79 B: a little bit but um they don't focus on on they try to make it nice and not um dirty and risque like i think that show i watched a couple of times they were i think they brought in 

401.86 402.95 A: mhm 

403.04 404.14 A: yes 

404.59 405.82 A: yes 

406.76 413.02 B: the the ex-boyfriends and said all this stuff about the girls i thought that was just low 

410.31 412.24 A: yes yes 

412.66 417.46 A: i did too i i i i felt a little bit of that and i that turned me off 

415.44 425.47 B: that's like a jerry springer version [laughter] see that yeah that's like a jerry springer and then um bachelor is like an oprah version of you know that show 

417.52 419.23 A: yeah i i 

423.11 424.31 A: mhm 

425.23 426.81 A: [lipsmack] yeah it's like uh 

425.61 428.00 B: a little bit more classy 

427.14 428.90 A: more like the enquirer 

428.98 431.19 B: mhm mhm 

429.15 433.63 A: almost that uh some of the reality shows remind me of that a 

433.73 442.61 B: yeah but i think the bachelor tries not to be that way oprah's like if you want to compare it to that i mean it's not a hundred percent because there's still stuff that 

434.09 435.12 A: bit more [lipsmack] 

437.47 438.90 A: well that's good 

439.76 440.81 A: mhm 

442.78 447.43 B: kind of goes on but um and then you also want hear later that the way they 

447.58 453.99 B: cut things you know [mn] you may be make people look worse than they are the way they edit you know 

451.80 452.92 A: oh yeah 

453.61 456.03 A: [laughter] yeah 

454.81 460.40 B: so you're not getting a clean picture sometimes and about what it really is going in 

458.21 459.33 A: sure 

460.42 462.90 A: oh that's interesting what nights is that on 

462.82 464.47 B: uh it's wednesday nights 

463.96 473.69 A: wednesday night i'll have to just take a look 'cause i i i haven't seen that one i like to just take a look to see when somebody says something about it at least i and say oh yes 

464.86 466.02 B: mhm 

467.89 468.72 B: (( yeah )) 

471.93 478.19 B: have an idea what they're have an idea and just kind of know what they're talking about but um yeah 

474.80 475.87 A: yeah 

477.01 479.62 A: course then i'll know what you do for entertainment 

479.48 480.56 B: [laughter] 

480.10 481.33 A: [laughter]

486.86 488.44 A: (( oh geez ))

493.48 494.72 A: yeah 

498.32 500.85 A: do you ever watch that date 

501.78 505.55 B: uh i think i heard about that uh 

504.50 508.47 A: it's it's usually one guy or one girl and they're given um 

508.71 516.17 A: four or five people that they go out with and they they just um they just eliminate 'em through the evening 

516.05 516.82 B: huh 

516.62 519.89 A: 'til they get down to the one that's that's 

518.21 520.19 B: oh really same idea kinda 

520.00 524.49 A: yeah it's kind of interesting or blind date i don't know if it's called blind date where they 

524.57 526.47 A: set 'em up with somebody that 

526.72 528.02 A: that they um 

528.76 533.41 A: both of them send in their profiles and they set 'em up those are pretty wild i've watched that 

532.42 538.38 B: yeah that's true i i mean there's more reality shows than we even [mn] i mean i can't even imagine now

553.16 554.65 B: having reality show 

554.42 555.59 A: mhm 

555.12 563.32 B: it has you know well of course they all are 'cause they're trying to fix someone's house and you kind of get to know the people and all that so that's 

563.81 572.23 B: 'cause you kind of get to see different go into someone's house and you know help them fix it and then there's one that's kind of a dating thing too 

570.68 573.06 A: [laughter] sure i've seen that 

572.47 573.93 B: have you seen the dating one 

574.18 575.76 A: no no 

574.58 580.44 B: where there's two i think like either two girls or two guy it changes and then 

580.56 591.88 B: they oh they go into these these bachelor's pads and then one girl decides whose pads going to be um fixed up and then they kind of have a date i mean it's real casual it's not real you know
