12.65 13.77 B: yep 

13.59 23.39 A: [lipsmack] and i um and if you like 'em i like 'em i think that they're very um entertaining i just can't believe that real people would sign up to do that kind of stuff 

23.24 28.33 B: [laughter] yeah i don't i guess i don't really watch 'em very much i'm a full time student 

28.47 30.98 B: so i don't really get a chance to watch t._v. 

31.17 34.69 B: but what i have seen of them they're they're different 

34.76 36.45 B: interesting [laughter] 

36.77 50.89 A: like i um i watched um it they said who wants to marry a millionaire i watched that first show um then the married in america i can't believe that people actually wanted to marry who america picked 

50.56 51.93 B: yeah 

51.41 56.17 A: and um survivor i watched that first season but not the other two 

56.38 62.80 B: i've watched survivor and there was another that i watched and i can't even remember what it's called 

63.13 71.62 B: but they would send a bunch of people out to with like a certain am- certain things and they had to like survive go through like a time thing 

71.28 72.69 A: oh okay 

72.18 82.86 B: yeah and so that was kind of cool they had to kind of like they'd get matches and they had to figure out how to waterproof the matches and swim out to this thing and light a fire 

73.23 74.08 A: it 

83.89 85.68 A: so they had challenges 

85.44 86.55 B: yeah 

86.49 92.31 A: now i um well i loved the mole and i watched all three seasons of the mole 

92.12 92.87 B: oh 

92.82 96.88 A: um it was the ah reality show that they went to europe 

92.97 93.77 B: (( really [mn] )) 

96.59 97.74 B: mhm 

97.12 103.04 A: and they had to go use clues to get to the country that they had to end up in 

103.11 104.18 B: oh okay 

104.03 107.76 A: and the person was trying to um to fool them 

108.01 113.38 A: um one person was hired by the producers to um get people to get out 

113.44 117.28 A: um to not be able to play the game they had they failed their tests 

116.87 117.96 B: oh yeah 

117.78 125.70 A: um and if you fool if the mole's got you if you were you know if you were caught by the mole then you wouldn't get to go for the next week 

125.46 126.61 B: oh weird 

125.97 132.83 A: and so you were trying to figure out who the mole was and still get money and figure out your clues to get to your next destination 

132.57 133.34 B: (( ha )) 

133.94 135.67 B: yeah i think i watched that one 

135.43 145.88 A: yeah it was really neat just because it was filmed in europe and um you got to see all the european countries um they were in italy they were in spain 

138.91 139.68 B: (( uh-huh )) 

146.62 150.25 A: so you got to see all the locales and then you got to watch the show 

149.96 151.35 B: oh well that's nice 

151.68 152.93 B: yeah that's cool 

153.21 154.23 B: um 

154.62 158.94 B: yeah i liked survivor i watched that a couple of times that was kind of neat 

158.98 162.52 B: and there's one for like younger people 

162.14 163.25 A: mhm 

162.83 164.35 B: (( that i was watching )) 

164.44 172.27 B: um i can't ever remember the names of all the shows but anyway it was pretty much like survivor but it was more kid based 

171.74 172.83 A: mhm 

172.85 174.18 B: so that was that 

174.21 181.40 B: was pretty interesting but i liked survivor just because you know they'd give you a they'd give you these tasks to do 

181.71 188.21 B: and and you sit back and you think my god i wonder if i can hold my arm up in the air without tipping a bucket of water over me or something 

187.46 189.24 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

188.26 196.29 B: you know [laughter] i mean you actually sit there and start thinking about it look at your husband and say okay you wanna try it [laughter] [laughter] 

196.49 197.50 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

197.50 202.95 A: yeah and ah they they're something else i i just can't like i said i can't believe people would actually 

203.24 205.04 A: you know do it 

204.42 206.00 B: exactly 

205.34 211.56 A: and i haven't seen ah any other shows like the gross shows like fear factor or those others that they make the people eat 

211.64 213.09 B: (( oh i )) 

211.69 215.12 A: awful stuff and i haven't seen those 

213.70 228.29 B: actually saw that i saw fear factor once or twice and they have to eat blood and well i'm swedish so [laughter] i've had to i've had to eat blood myself but [laughter] i mean 

222.52 223.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

226.23 227.22 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

228.45 231.82 B: but yeah there's some nasty nasty things they make you do 

231.91 232.99 B: terrible 

234.29 241.03 A: and so yeah i haven't um i didn't i didn't watch fear factor and i think fox had a ah had a pretend show 

241.08 242.13 A: um 

242.46 245.83 A: that they would challenge people to do the um 

246.23 249.19 A: the dangerous things for money but really 

249.27 251.96 A: so they would have one person got shocked 

251.84 252.82 B: oh yeah 

252.06 265.25 A: on the electric chair show or whatever but it really it wasn't on and so the person who didn't know it wasn't real would try to hurry up and answer the questions and and be upset if they answered it wrong 'cause they thought they'd get shocked 

255.97 256.89 B: oh 

261.03 262.00 B: [laughter] 

265.47 267.09 A: [laughter]

270.95 273.74 B: or what's that show where they um 

274.23 279.99 B: what would you do if you're being chased by sharks and then they have like stunt people being chased by sharks 

279.40 292.16 A: yeah that's brand new that's brand new and it's supposed to really end up helping you because it gives you situations that may happen and you'll have solutions for what you um you know to what you could do to survive 

281.48 282.63 B: [laughter] 

291.57 293.93 B: yeah well 

293.01 296.06 A: like if you ever were attacked by a dog
