51.02 53.65 B: [noise] [lipsmack] oh what was it married by america 

53.87 58.42 A: i haven't seen that i haven't the only ones that i have watched is survivors 

54.12 54.89 B: and 

58.81 59.80 A: and 

59.09 59.96 B: and 

60.08 63.87 A: i'm pretty much gotten hooked on survivors and 

63.97 64.85 A: um 

66.16 69.42 A: um basically i haven't seen any of the other ones 

69.72 74.09 A: i have you ever watched like the one where they have the people locked up in a house 

74.43 75.45 A: and they 

74.53 75.44 B: [mn] ah 

75.82 83.04 B: the ah i think it's called something like the manor house or something like that i haven't watched it personally um 

79.77 80.57 A: (( they keep )) 

81.71 82.92 A: i haven't either 

83.35 90.69 B: i saw one not too long ago i started out watching it where it's one with this family they were competing for one million dollars 

88.00 89.23 A: (( mhm )) 

90.01 90.94 A: mhm 

90.72 92.23 B: and um 

92.55 98.47 B: after a while i think i watched maybe two shows of it and after that it's like okay yeah you know 

97.30 99.44 A: [laughter] 

98.48 101.06 B: [laughter] ah this is not worth too much 

101.11 115.59 B: but um i'm guilty of watching the ones where i have a vote in what you know in what i see and what goes on and who stays like american idol but that's not that's not a reality t._v. show but um the one 

107.84 109.42 A: oh like um 

111.61 112.57 A: yeah 

114.66 115.66 A: yeah my hus- 

115.76 118.52 A: ah my husband's hooked on that one um 

117.75 118.55 B: [laughter] 

118.68 131.30 A: but i like the survivors and it's they they say one of the questions is why we think they're popular and i think they're popular people watch those shows because they can actually visualize themselves 

131.42 133.38 A: doing those things 

133.94 136.84 A: they actually think that they themselves 

136.86 138.35 A: could participate 

138.71 144.25 A: i mean i i think that's why i watch survivor is because i i think i could probably go there and do it 

146.46 149.11 A: what do you think why do you think they're so popular 

147.76 148.45 B: w- 

149.26 156.01 B: w- the reason i really think they're so popular is because people are just trying to get away from everyday normal life 

155.95 157.53 A: oh from reality 

156.29 157.21 B: (( um )) 

157.47 159.53 B: yeah i mean you know they're 

158.16 164.24 A: [laughter] they're watching reality shows to get away from reality actually i i i think you're probably right 

161.39 162.38 B: (( yeah )) 

164.22 171.32 B: and i mean because the thing is is that even though these are reality t._v. shows people half the people who watch those shows 

167.96 168.85 A: mhm 

170.88 171.79 A: mhm 

171.17 179.05 B: they don't ei- they either don't have enough nerve to even consider doing something like that or they don't think they have enough ability to do anything like that so 

174.96 175.85 A: uh-huh 

178.41 179.25 A: right 

178.84 188.60 B: you know they sit there and they watch it and you know it's like you said they wished they could do it and they get so involved in it but a lot of people who watch reality t._v. shows 

181.23 182.21 A: mhm 

182.88 183.78 A: mhm 

188.92 192.08 B: really wouldn't consider even doing half like fear factor 

192.35 198.95 B: half those people wouldn't go on there and eat you know goats' brains and and things like that you know so 

195.71 196.91 A: (( oh god )) 

197.75 198.66 A: yeah 

198.77 202.83 A: that's why i don't watch that particular one because to me it's disgusting 

203.29 204.22 B: yeah 

204.20 211.40 A: and the thing with survivors when they had the episode where they have to eat the worms or whatever i that's the one i always do missed 

204.53 205.39 B: (( oh )) 

211.59 213.95 A: because that to me is yuk 

215.22 216.08 A: um 

215.46 217.36 B: i understand that 

216.71 219.05 A: [laughter] so um 

219.70 220.65 A: (( let's see )) 

221.47 225.78 A: um well we covered why they we think they're popular um 

227.45 228.72 A: (( what else can we say )) 

227.63 235.40 B: but um i mean i believe they also said like to discuss ah some of the ones you watch but you know you basically ah you said you watch survivor 

235.31 238.69 A: yeah i only watch survivor an- and you which ones do you watch 

235.70 236.81 B: and um 

238.63 248.92 B: um i have watched i'm a celebrity get me out of here um like i said i tend to watch those t._v. reality shows that i can vote on ah i watched married by america 

246.18 247.10 A: uh-huh 

249.23 253.12 B: ah believe it or not i did get into joe millionaire 

252.78 254.36 A: oh did you watch that one 

253.98 258.94 B: i got into it right at the end um i think i might have saw 

259.34 260.45 B: um 

260.49 264.19 B: i saw the last two or three episodes where he was down to two women 

264.09 264.98 A: uh-huh 

265.03 268.37 B: um and i believe those were the last two or three episodes so i 

268.49 276.88 B: um i wh- what i usually do when it comes to those shows i watch the first show to see who's all competitive no who all the competitors are 

274.05 275.04 A: mhm 

276.54 277.45 A: mhm 

276.99 281.50 B: and then after that i you know watch the last show to see who won 

281.55 285.19 B: you know because ah i think the first um 

285.64 290.47 B: the first guy ah who ah who wants to marry was it a who wants to marry a millionaire 

289.80 291.44 A: (( yeah who wants to marry a millionaire )) 

290.47 296.43 B: oh no no no no it was yeah i think that was the first show but the bachelor the first bachelor that was enough 

296.31 311.01 B: once you watched the first bachelor you knew how the rest of 'em were gonna go you know the bachelorette and i mean it's ah i did i i watched the last show of that i did not watch the first bachelorette but i did watch the last two shows when she was down to the last two men 

299.74 300.30 A: (( mm )) 

306.37 307.09 A: (( mhm )) 

310.90 314.53 A: did you watch the new one that's coming out with monica lewinsky 

311.25 312.21 B: but 

314.43 317.74 B: no i'm not watching mr personality um 

316.70 322.34 A: no i haven't seen it either and what do you think about her being a um person on that show what do you think of 

318.32 319.78 B: i did 

321.39 322.04 B: [laughter] 

322.42 327.16 B: i just figure anything that has monica lewinsky hosting it is probably trash 

322.50 323.25 A: them 

326.68 328.25 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

327.21 328.71 B: i just you know 

328.94 331.78 B: i'm sorry i just i really do 

330.05 338.42 A: yeah exactly it's very strange that she gets a job um or a position doing that just because of having sex with the president 

339.67 341.07 B: yeah 

340.45 343.82 A: yeah i pretty pretty sleazy pretty sleazy 

343.03 345.02 B: very sleazy [laughter] 

344.80 345.69 A: [laughter] 

345.49 348.42 B: especially for um 

348.44 351.83 B: personal gain you know that's just really awful 

349.73 351.30 A: mhm 

351.70 353.61 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

352.66 362.63 B: that's just really awful so and i mean that was that was her main reason um she knew that when she went into that situation there was a something there was a chance of something to happen to her like it did 

354.04 355.54 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

362.29 363.81 A: mhm 

362.66 375.63 B: and unfortunately it didn't really blow up as big she wanted it to 'cause she wanted to get paid you know out of it but i mean you know she she basically she's ruined her life and her career because look at where she's at now she was a intern 

368.11 369.50 A: yeah 

375.48 377.07 A: mhm 

375.67 378.88 B: on her way to probably being some type of congress woman 

378.60 379.68 A: mhm 

379.09 384.36 B: and she demoralized herself but now you know she's doing t- you know t._v. reality shows on 

384.45 385.47 B: (( um )) 

385.43 396.26 B: somebody who is supposed to be picking somebody over their personality of all things 'cause i don't bet she picked bill clinton over his personality i'm sure he's a pretty nice guy but um you know 

389.36 390.28 A: mhm 

394.02 394.94 A: mhm 

396.17 401.00 B: i think if at any point in time if it if it was any president she would have did it 

400.90 404.51 A: yes well anybody in in a power position she would've 

401.13 403.06 B: (( so i just don't think it )) 

404.40 407.25 B: (( yeah i think helped that he was attractive )) 

408.19 410.66 A: mm you think bill clinton's attractive 

410.66 413.82 B: so well it when he first got into office 

413.41 415.72 A: i i i liked his hair and that was all 

413.86 414.57 B: i 

416.40 422.70 B: ah when he when he first got into office when it 'cause of after he got out of office his hair was grey 

418.57 419.60 A: mhm 

422.45 424.12 A: mhm 

422.83 436.21 B: that he was he was starting to age but but if if you look can look back to nineteen ninety two i believe when bill clinton first got elected he had that dark hair and he was very distinguished looking he was an attractive man he 

424.85 425.95 A: mhm 

429.08 430.20 A: mhm 

432.54 433.76 A: mhm 

436.09 444.08 A: yeah he is he was good looking but there's nothing that'll age a man faster than being the president if you've never noticed when they've 

436.52 437.61 B: really was 

438.62 439.78 B: mhm 

442.65 448.56 B: yeah 'cause bush has started to look his age and he hadn't even been in there two three years yet oh 

445.16 445.83 A: yeah 

447.94 449.41 A: yes yes 

449.88 452.04 A: as a matter of fact he's on t._v. right now 

452.20 453.25 B: is he 

452.88 454.07 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

454.07 459.51 B: um i think they've shown that here is that the one where he's giving the speech the address 

458.35 460.30 A: yeah we saw that now he's 

460.48 463.40 A: somewhere else they're just showing it on the news 

463.38 464.65 B: oh okay 

464.78 465.59 A: (( ah um )) 

465.73 466.51 A: yeah 

467.01 472.40 A: but anyway um to that's a real reality show watching the troops over there 

471.18 472.40 B: [laughter] 

472.57 474.54 B: yeah yeah um 

474.62 482.95 B: i don't know i think and i think that's another thing too people get so hooked into reality t._v. shows because it's really hard nowadays to distinguish reality from fiction 

482.50 483.69 A: mhm 

483.35 497.46 B: you know you you you know you see things on who wants to be a mar ah who wants to marry a millionaire and bachelorette and you know i'm i'm um a celebrity get me out of here and um what's the other shows um 

493.95 494.85 A: mhm 

496.58 511.39 A: well there is one that's that the kids watch that's called jackass or something and i i keep reading different articles where these stupid teenage kids and younger watch those shows and then they do that to themselves like set themselves on fire 

500.67 501.94 B: mhm 

511.41 513.49 A: and um 

511.49 512.70 B: mhm 

514.16 517.73 A: s- some of 'em have gotten really injured because they watch that 

516.29 517.16 B: yeah 

517.85 521.44 A: on their reality shows and then they think they can do it 

522.18 523.65 A: which is really stupid 

523.74 526.93 B: yeah and i think i mean i think um 

526.97 527.93 B: that's 

528.24 533.01 B: that's what's so hard about like you know they call it reality t._v. shows 

532.61 533.85 A: mhm 

533.11 542.93 B: so these kids see jackass and they see these guys doing these stunts and get injured but you know what they survive 

539.81 541.50 A: mhm 

542.78 543.80 A: right 

543.50 549.27 B: so why can't we do it because this is reality t._v. these guys actually are doing these stunts 

549.29 551.66 A: that's an excellent point stephanie 

549.95 550.76 B: (( you know )) 

551.46 564.01 B: so you know so why can't we do it because you know you know i've i've seen a few of those shows and they've shown johnny knoxville a few times i mean he's been on crutches and he's had a broken leg and broken 

557.86 558.47 A: (( yeah )) 

563.97 567.89 B: (( arm and i like i said these i mean these kids still watch it and stuff )) 

567.64 570.11 A: what is he a person like evil kenevil or 

567.98 569.17 B: and 

569.75 571.21 B: yeah 

570.38 571.84 A: oh i've never seen it 

572.55 573.22 A: (( mm )) 

572.82 577.72 B: so i mean you know it's it's i mean they do some horrendous stunts 

577.41 578.38 A: mhm 

578.01 580.66 B: i mean it's real i mean it's just awful 

580.75 581.46 A: hm 

580.78 581.83 B: um 

582.24 588.48 A: i i've never seen it but i sure have read a different a couple of different times articles in newspapers about kids who have 

588.64 589.73 A: who have 

589.79 590.64 A: um 

591.50 599.72 A: really injured themselves severely trying to do some of those stunts and then their parents turn arou- are suing the show
