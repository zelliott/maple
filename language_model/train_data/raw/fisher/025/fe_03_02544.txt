9.84 12.78 B: oh okay it's my first time as well 

12.85 18.45 B: and um i guess our topic is reality the the reality shows 

18.09 19.09 A: yes 

18.46 21.71 B: do you um do you get a chance to watch those 

21.52 24.10 A: not at all i've seen 

24.37 26.67 A: survivor once 

26.14 27.22 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

27.78 39.85 B: oh this is gonna be very interesting because i haven't seen [laughter] [laughter] very very interesting so we just have to keep the call going [laughter] 

31.63 32.84 A: [laughter] 

37.42 40.53 A: so you haven't seen reality t._v. at all okay 

40.15 50.65 B: no because and i may um kind of make this a little let's let's make this a little long here [laughter] because um 

43.79 46.77 A: (( we haven't so next subject [laughter] mhm mhm okay because um it's like no i haven't seen it i )) 

51.21 56.22 B: for some reason i've gotten out of the habit of watching television 

56.28 58.32 B: um i love movies 

58.35 61.63 B: so i might rent a lot of movies um 

61.74 76.45 B: and ah you know or if a movie comes on t._v. i'll watch it but ah i leave all the t._v. shows up to my children and i know they keep up with the reality t._v. 'cause i hear them always making comments about it 

76.32 86.45 B: and so um people at work you know how that is people at work they get together and start um talking about the t._v. shows and i can't really 

84.23 85.12 A: (( haven't seen it but )) 

87.16 88.44 A: (( you know time is )) 

88.81 90.00 B: (( comment )) 

90.03 93.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

96.77 97.94 A: (( so short you know yes )) 

97.29 106.57 B: and um so what i spend a lot of time probably a little bit too much time doing is on um i'm on the computer 

106.67 107.63 A: okay 

107.05 108.55 B: so um 

108.87 118.75 B: but i'm not just looking for anything i um have one email address where i have um just different businesses coming to me 

118.57 119.48 A: mhm 

119.02 121.71 B: and and that's how i found out this one 

121.66 122.68 A: okay 

122.41 127.69 B: so what i do is you know i'll um and i have six children so 

127.57 138.76 B: um once i get them situated and i think i pretty much got 'em situated 'cause we all went out shopping tonight but um once i get them situated i'll get on the computer for about an hour or two 

138.58 146.95 B: and i will look you know check out different businesses and so like i said um that's how i found out about this one 

146.83 148.48 A: okay so 

147.46 153.67 B: so so you tell me a little bit about [laughter] you know you did see one you saw one episode 

150.08 150.91 A: next 

152.57 160.73 A: i've seen survivor i don't know if i've seen the entire episode i doubt it um i just i i i'm 

157.36 158.29 B: uh-huh 

160.79 167.18 A: i guess the next topic within this is why do we feel that people watch reality t._v. 

166.60 167.67 B: okay 

167.41 178.17 A: and so i guess it's a form of escape for people i think that it's a form of escape who watch t._v. in general but i think as far a reality t._v. goes it's it's you're watching someone who's actually 

179.25 193.21 A: um you know real life person um doing something some sort of i guess challenge rea- survivor's a challenge to do something or or survive on an island or something doing something that everyday people can do 

181.51 182.07 B: (( [mn] )) 

184.98 186.04 B: right 

186.66 187.69 B: yeah 

187.90 188.98 B: yeah 

190.36 191.32 B: mhm 

192.74 197.42 B: [mn] right and another thing i think that's really interesting is that it's real time 

197.88 198.96 A: (( yes you )) 

198.24 207.27 B: and um it's like it's not you know taped ahea- well it could be taped ahead of time i'm not sure but it's not acted out 

205.04 206.42 A: think they're taped ahead 

207.56 208.50 A: mhm 

207.64 217.30 B: and it's like okay what's gonna happen you know [laughter] and i think you know that is that has a lot a to do with it 

216.73 219.77 A: so you think people are looking for suspense when they're watching it 

219.10 233.59 B: yeah yeah and it's like it's not acted out so it's like okay what's gonna happen next and they're just you know thinking and hoping and ah p- probably wishing that you know something out of the ordinary happens 

233.59 234.53 A: okay 

233.71 245.51 B: you know and ah i you know it's it's a form of entertainment of course just like you know all the rest of it but then i think this one is a little bit more intriguing 

245.48 248.73 B: um because y- you just don't know what's gonna happen [noise] [noise] 

248.85 251.43 A: okay i just i just i 

251.51 255.66 A: from what i could see of survivor and um i've seen 

255.88 258.01 A: i guess i saw the last 

258.20 262.58 A: piece of the bachelor which is a reality show um i 

259.87 260.62 B: (( mhm )) 

261.35 262.26 B: uh-huh 

262.85 270.61 A: was over at a friend's house they were all kind of watching the end of it and and they were very caught up in the whole 

265.63 266.55 B: mhm 

266.93 267.78 B: mhm 

270.52 284.52 A: reality of it and yelling and screaming at the t._v. set and and don't chose this and do that and do that and i just thought it was you know this is somebody else it's not you why are you so involved don't you have other things to keep you busy 

272.70 275.56 B: [laughter] 

275.74 277.71 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

280.35 281.27 B: right 

281.97 285.82 B: right [laughter] 

284.80 292.03 A: so i i usually have other things to keep me busy um and i i do watch t._v. i'm not gonna say that i'm a huge 

287.11 288.01 B: right 

290.22 291.15 B: mhm 

292.09 299.76 A: fan of t._v. but i watch t._v. but i don't watch reality t._v. because i think there's enough going on in the world that's real 

298.50 300.98 B: right right right 

299.82 304.98 A: there's enough that you see every day that's that's so real especially with um 

304.99 316.98 A: you know the reporting and things up close and in your face there's enough reality on day to day life and just getting through that other than watching other people who aren't like you and i 

309.39 310.67 B: right 

311.12 312.06 B: uh-huh 

312.64 313.52 B: mhm 

316.49 317.48 B: mhm 

317.16 320.67 A: getting through a show it it's um 

319.28 320.23 B: yeah 

321.48 324.11 A: it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me whatsoever 

322.91 326.48 B: yeah i don't know i i guess i think it's um 

326.60 329.89 B: just really intriguing to some people 

329.74 344.28 B: you know and there's like oh my god i gotta get home n- you know to watch this and they make sure they watch it some people if they miss it they tape it you know to make sure they don't miss anything but it's almost like a soap opera 

339.24 340.28 A: mhm 

344.52 346.30 A: well yes 

345.68 348.59 B: almost you know you wanna 

347.17 355.37 A: almost in a sense but it is real [laughter] so i mean with if it's a soap opera you know it's a complete fantasy and you know you've got the drama you've got the music you've got 

349.81 351.63 B: yeah yeah 

355.52 356.49 B: right 

355.64 363.92 A: you can sort of predict on soap operas what's going on but with reality t._v. i i would presume that they feel like it's very unpredictable 

363.49 368.32 B: yeah but i feel like it's more like a soap opera in that 

368.15 370.25 B: you know you're caught up in it 

370.05 383.15 B: um when you're when after the show is over you gotta call you know girl did you see that or it's the topic at work every day okay what happened i missed you know survivor last night what happened 

382.93 392.06 B: you know and in that respect i think it's like a soap opera [laughter] you know 'cause i'm sure a lot of people discuss it 

391.79 398.44 A: oh a lot of people do discuss it [mn] well i have a female all female office so they're they're constantly discussing 

393.07 394.03 B: yeah 

396.10 397.00 B: uh-huh 

397.78 399.15 B: yeah 

398.53 411.71 A: different reality shows that happen and i in a in a way i feel left out in a way i just kind of listen to them go and forth and the banter that goes back and forth and at some points i think it's absolutely ridiculous 

400.49 401.48 B: yeah 

408.34 409.23 B: mhm 

411.11 413.55 B: [laughter] 

412.92 417.03 A: (( [laughter] you know i saw that last night and it wasn't reality t._v. )) 

416.43 418.32 B: oh goodness 

417.46 418.81 A: so it's ah 

418.89 423.66 A: i i guess it's a cop- a common ground for a lot of people as well 

423.21 424.16 B: yeah 

423.80 431.16 A: i don't know if people have gotten together before on other t._v. shows and and and talked basically about what happened other than soap operas 

427.16 428.08 B: mhm 

430.59 432.60 B: right right 

431.23 436.57 A: but i guess reality t._v. has something for everyone it's more like common ground 

434.58 435.54 B: mhm 

435.95 437.59 B: mhm mhm 

436.79 438.38 A: which is very interesting 

437.99 444.45 B: right right so i don't know um it makes me even just want to 

444.57 456.83 B: look at an episode just so you know 'cause you know they picked this topic for some reason so it makes me wanna even just look an episode to just see what's going on 

456.96 457.99 A: (( oh boy )) 

457.35 459.85 B: you know [laughter] 

458.41 460.65 A: that's more peer pressure [laughter] 

459.96 468.10 B: [laughter] you know but it's not something you know that i think i would get hooked up in 

468.25 471.04 B: you know i'd just all my time is 

471.33 472.21 B: you know 

472.93 474.07 B: i have to 

474.18 476.12 B: weigh things out here 

476.40 485.12 B: but but i think another reason why um i don't watch t._v. like i should it's because i don't know how to get away from it 

484.93 494.26 B: you know you watch these shows and then the next one come on and then the next one come on and before i know it i'm up at one or two o'clock in the morning 

493.86 495.00 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

494.28 499.82 B: 'cause it's like oh my god this the previews look so good i just gotta watch it 

499.38 500.59 A: mhm 

499.90 501.50 B: so it's like 

501.66 511.50 B: um i'm just undisciplined in that area so it's like okay it's better for me just to stay away for right now you know 

510.48 516.09 A: well wh- when you say that the previews look so good then you obviously have an interest in watching what's going on 

515.71 518.45 B: yeah yeah i do oh 

516.48 520.04 A: okay so they it it would hook you if it if if you 

519.25 520.67 B: oh 

520.49 527.35 B: no doubt no doubt [laughter] it's not that i don't have it it just is that 

527.17 535.72 B: i don't know how to control it [laughter] control it and and i just like i say i find myself 

535.98 546.19 B: i'm show after show after show after show for hours 'cause you really can do it for hours become a t._v. junkie 

543.98 545.02 A: okay 

545.83 546.74 A: mhm 

546.32 547.24 B: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

547.38 561.57 B: that's um for me it's better right now to kind of spend my time a little wisely elsewhere um but i'm sure i'll get back to it and i'll probably get sucked right back into the same thing 

561.55 563.13 A: [laughter] 

562.54 566.54 B: [laughter] yeah 

565.03 566.74 A: okay well 

566.67 567.66 B: so 

567.16 581.56 A: if they if they if they do something that's probably very intriguing to me or within my field i did watch and it i i would presume its p._b._s.'s version of reality t._v. they have a show on called um manor the manor house 

577.20 578.33 B: oh 

580.94 582.26 B: oh okay 

581.53 587.77 A: or manor house um for the last three evenings and that's was intriguing it because it was they took 

582.46 584.13 B: mhm mhm 

587.90 591.25 A: several people and they took them back into the eighteenth century 

590.90 591.89 B: (( mm oh )) 

591.31 597.91 A: and put them in this manor house in england and they had to live as if they were in edwardian times with um 

593.52 594.55 B: (( wow )) 

598.05 599.89 A: oh coal in the st-
