20.35 22.68 A: cool yeah it's beautiful down there 

22.30 28.23 B: so do you watch who wants to be a millionaire or or who wants to marry a millionaire and all the rest of this stuff 

27.63 35.12 A: um let's see i watch american idol um that's probably the only reality show that i really watch 

34.71 35.61 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

35.19 36.30 A: how 'bout you 

36.21 43.35 B: i don't watch any of them i can't stand them that's cool in fact this morning i was watching either 

38.03 39.42 A: none of them 

40.28 41.40 A: [laughter] 

43.25 56.04 B: the today show or good morning america one of the morning news shows and they're constantly interviewing you know losers from survivor or losers from american idol or winners from the bachelor and it's just 

46.81 47.92 A: mhm 

54.58 55.81 A: uh-huh 

56.02 69.36 B: the whole the whole trend with the bachelor and and the bachelorette really to me is i mean i might have sampled it for thirty seconds and i just went i'm not watching this [laughter] 

65.58 67.12 A: mhm 

68.63 74.39 A: i know yeah i even sampled that new one um mr personality 

73.90 76.83 B: oh with monica lewinsky [laughter] mhm 

75.31 84.40 A: yes because um it was on the same channel as the show i was watching before that so i didn't turn it right away and it was terrible it was the worse thing i've ever seen on t._v. 

83.92 94.84 B: yeah i i actually slipped over i think while whatever i was watching was in commercial and saw uh same thing maybe thirty seconds and i went nope not worth my time 

85.76 86.52 A: (( [cough] )) 

88.75 90.15 A: mhm 

94.29 97.67 A: yeah yeah they're really bad um 

98.01 106.27 A: [lipsmack] but they're so much a huge part of the culture now like you said they're always on t._v. people at work are always talking about 'em and so i'm kind of out of the loop [laughter] 

103.89 104.85 B: (( yes )) 

106.30 114.53 B: well i j- i i used to work in broadcasting and i just find [mn] television news now just it's 

109.36 110.69 A: oh did 

114.99 116.22 B: (( [mn] infotainment you )) 

116.40 117.83 A: (( you yeah )) 

116.53 123.85 B: know and to call some of these things reality you know the whole joe millionaire thing which was a put up job 

123.81 131.93 B: um i never watched that but you couldn't you couldn't get away from references to it on on you know talk shows or other things and i 

123.95 125.12 A: yeah 

131.84 140.42 B: try and limit my t._v. watching to news programs and sports and a couple of series like tonight e._r. is on i will watch er 

138.69 141.26 A: uh-huh yeah 

140.57 151.60 B: but um to me it it it you know it's cheaper for them to do these programs than than a sitcom or an hour long drama which is the most expensive thing to produce 

151.09 155.06 A: well yeah and they don't have to pay established actors 

154.43 155.70 B: exactly 

155.13 160.66 A: so and i think it's a lot of people who are really in it to break into show business 

160.06 165.60 B: i agree and i gather this summer there are going to be a bunch more of them 

161.14 162.16 A: so 

165.04 171.25 A: that's what i've heard and they're actually now on cable gonna have a a reality t._v. channel 

170.54 172.22 B: oh i saw that 

171.68 173.15 A: did you [laughter] 

172.71 176.13 B: i saw that news clip i went that's just that's 

175.98 184.33 B: that's beyond the pale of course you know when they announced that there was going to be the game show channel i didn't think that would ever fly and the cartoon network and 

180.67 181.71 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

184.03 185.40 A: mhm 

184.22 195.99 B: i actually occasionally watch the cartoon network [laughter] i'm in my forties i don't know how old you are but now and then when huckleberry hound is on and i haven't seen it since i was eight years old it's pretty entertaining 

186.57 188.56 A: so do i yeah 

190.00 191.15 A: [laughter] 

194.27 203.07 A: uh-huh yeah actually they have some weird ones the newer cartoons are just they're kinda out there [laughter] but um 

200.65 202.29 B: yeah yeah 

204.11 206.77 A: [lipsmack] yeah i don't know it's kinda crazy 

206.95 215.74 B: the the other thing about these so called i mean to to call it reality program just it's it's wrong to me to begin with but uh 

214.39 215.78 A: oh yeah 

215.91 217.92 B: but when um when the 

218.08 228.84 B: game show who wants to be a millionaire was such a big success and i think it was the same summer that survivor first came on i think that's the first one did you watch that the original survivor much 

221.54 222.21 A: (( mm )) 

224.65 226.67 A: i think so yeah 

228.36 241.88 A: i i didn't no and i found it very like um i think i saw the very end of it maybe the last show because some of my friends were hooked on it but no i never i've never watched a whole season of survivor so 

237.64 238.52 B: uh-huh 

241.12 249.98 B: yeah and i didn't think that that would be such a success 'cause that was very much a summer replacement kind of thing 'cause you know it was a a condensed 

246.99 248.38 A: mhm 

249.91 262.72 B: single shot kind of feeling but they've had what four spin offs since and i i same thing i don't watch them it's it's people like you said who are lusting after a career in t._v. or wanna be famous for fifteen minutes 

260.53 262.22 A: mhm 

262.49 268.67 A: yeah and it's definitely not going to end i mean like i watch the real world i think um 

268.42 269.76 B: on m._t._v. 

268.75 280.65 A: [mn] yeah a a few times i was never one of those people that watched every episode of the season but i'd seen a few of them and i didn't think that that would last either and i think there's been like twenty of them 

280.17 285.84 B: yeah they they did it in seattle here some years back and uh i didn't have 

283.11 284.88 A: oh yeah i remember that 

286.11 294.14 B: uh in fact this this baseball season is the first baseball se- i'm a baseball fan first season i've had cable since nineteen ninety 

290.65 291.67 A: uh-huh 

293.42 294.81 A: oh wow 

293.99 304.21 B: i i purposely went when i moved to seattle in ninety four cable was so expensive i just refused to buy it so i relied on over the air tv so anything i was out of the loop on 

299.61 302.80 A: oh yeah uh-huh 

304.21 316.67 B: uh all of m._t._v. and and comedy central i mean uh the south park phenomenon and uh when the real world a new one would come up it got a lot of discussion and publicity here in seattle when they were 

308.03 309.02 A: (( [mn] )) 

309.59 311.20 A: oh yeah 

316.72 323.69 B: filming it here and i was completely oblivious because i didn't have cable and [laughter] and so i didn't watch it 

317.81 319.05 A: i bet 

320.97 332.13 A: i know it's tough yeah even now all of my friends have um the pay channel h._b._o. and everything and there's so many shows on those channels that are so huge 

331.79 341.73 B: yeah and see i have cable but i don't get h. i don't use the pay channels so i'm out on the s- with the sopranos and six feet under which i gather are very entertaining programs [mn] yeah 

335.63 336.63 A: uh-huh 

337.32 339.23 A: mhm 

340.44 343.33 A: that's what i've heard yeah i haven't seen them though 

342.29 346.89 B: and what's what's the one about gay uh gay people uh queer as folk 

345.38 346.49 A: oh 

346.54 348.08 A: yeah exactly 

347.35 349.99 B: and that got some good press i've never seen it 

349.67 355.07 A: i haven't seen any of them either i know they have 'em on video and everything now they're at the video store 

350.88 351.96 B: (( i guess you unbelievable )) 

355.47 356.60 A: huge 

356.14 357.36 B: yeah 

356.96 367.91 A: yeah when i was in i lived in florida for a little while and we didn't i didn't have cable there for a year and my husband's a big sports fan too so he was kind of dying [laughter] 

367.18 372.98 B: [laughter] well you know you learn to live without it [laughter] [lipsmack] 

368.16 369.38 A: [laughter] 

370.85 377.11 A: yeah yeah he said if i could just have e._s._p._n. and nothing else 

374.65 380.99 B: well that's what i always said if i could just have e._s._p._n. and c._n._n. but after the experience of the war i have no 

377.87 379.56 A: yeah 

380.95 390.64 B: [laughter] no great love for c._n._n. yeah and and i have somewhat limited cable so so one of the nice things i have is um canadian broadcasting company 

382.86 384.43 A: yeah 

389.96 391.45 A: (( oh do you )) 

391.13 405.61 B: so i got to watch their coverage of the war more and on canadian t._v. they don't have any so called reality shows but they do have some great new satire programs there's one called the royal canadian air farce 

398.56 399.81 A: mhm 

402.81 404.42 A: (( oh do they )) 

405.33 406.75 A: oh how funny 

405.47 412.58 B: which is all about current affairs and the other one which is my favorite show on television it's called this hour has twenty two minutes 

407.51 408.83 A: (( uh-huh )) 

412.17 413.23 A: uh-huh 

412.74 423.39 B: and it's it's there used to be a show from britain you're probably too young to remember called that was the week that was and they tried to do in syndication in this country maybe twenty years ago and it failed and it was just 

418.87 419.96 A: uh-huh 

423.26 429.21 B: it was sort of sort of what saturday night live does with their weekend update news segment 

428.79 430.58 A: oh yeah i love that 

429.83 436.41 B: and right and that's kind of what this hour has twenty two minutes is it's a half an hour show and it's a fake newscast 

433.66 435.44 A: oh uh-huh 

436.06 437.85 A: oh funny 

436.33 448.14 B: but it's based on the current events and a lot of it deals with america and the war you know in the last month if if you um if you scoop uh i mean surf the internet you can pick it up on uh 

438.63 439.58 A: right 

440.29 441.69 A: oh 

445.43 446.36 A: uh-huh 

447.94 457.48 B: [lipsmack] they have replays of it on it's it's just w. w. w. dot twenty two minutes dot com or it might be dot c. a. because it's canada 

454.00 454.96 A: oh 

456.01 460.52 A: is twenty two spelled out or is it just oh okay 

457.59 459.80 B: twenty two with the two digits 

459.87 469.87 B: yeah um w. or the other thing is if you go to w. w. w. dot c._b._c. dot c. a. and then you can link to twenty two minutes 

465.10 466.16 A: uh-huh 

467.14 468.01 A: uh-huh 

469.56 471.11 A: oh okay 

469.96 473.73 B: it's it's very very entertaining and and for 

472.28 474.66 A: yeah i'll have to check that out 

473.62 487.88 B: for people who can't get c._b._c. over i wish that cable companies you know like it was very interesting to watch al jazeera when they carry it on the cspan or they carry it on c._n._n. for brief times where cspan did a lot of during the war a lot of 

482.86 484.41 A: right 

487.67 492.65 B: other countries' news coverage they had the b._b._c. news they had 

489.69 491.13 A: mhm 

492.53 502.97 B: um the lebanese [laughter] news channel you know to see the point of view they carried cana- um canadian but also uh chinese they carried the chinese t._v. news 

495.75 497.05 A: yeah 

501.96 513.38 A: oh i never saw that see i watch b._b._c. news um quite a bit and they did that as well on b._b._c. they would show al jazeera and jordanian news but i never saw anything from china 

504.80 506.02 B: mhm 

511.14 512.82 B: other countries yeah 

512.96 524.95 B: yeah it's it's really fascinating to get you know their perspective and a and a different point of view and i think the whole reality t._v. thing on american network television is just it's just junk it's not even 

517.63 519.50 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

525.20 530.53 B: i'm amazed the ratings it gets it proves that people will be entertained by anything 

528.80 529.68 A: (( [sigh] )) 

529.95 537.20 A: i know and well in i guess that reality t._v. channel they're gonna have a lot from britain i guess britain started it 

536.69 544.69 B: yeah well i think american idol was originally a british show and and the who wants to be a millionaire game show was originally a british show 

539.64 541.54 A: yeah 

543.94 550.37 A: yeah they were saying that we think we invent everything but a lot of [mn] our ideas come from english tv 

549.06 549.78 B: yeah 

549.84 563.08 B: yeah yeah and i guess i guess the reality thing has been somewhat big in japan to just like game shows have always been huge in japan and they're very evil i mean they do they do cruel things to people and uh uh 

551.11 551.93 A: so 

554.63 556.43 A: oh really 

561.02 562.44 A: really 

563.44 566.48 B: i've never seen any but the few things i've read about it they're 

566.20 571.97 A: they have shows like that on m._t._v. i think where they kind of do that they 

572.14 577.15 A: they do mean things to people kind of play pranks on 'em and mhm 

573.55 576.93 B: they're mhm yeah these prank jokes yeah yeah 

577.52 584.54 A: yeah i'd be interested to see if the [sigh] ones in england are a lot different than our reality t._v. shows 

584.22 593.43 B: yeah yeah well i if i ever get to england i'll be sure to to to watch that but unlike most of my friends who spent last summer in europe i've yet to go [laughter] 

588.32 589.24 A: [laughter] 

591.87 593.76 A: oh really 

593.68 598.50 B: never been overseas been to mexico a lot in fact when i lived in tucson we went down all the time 

597.90 599.46 A: (( oh yeah i bet ))
