0.00 1.78 B: hello my name is paul 

1.26 3.02 A: hi my name is sharon 

2.79 4.41 B: how are you doing today sharon 

3.79 5.97 A: got a hot topic don't we [mn] 

5.19 9.13 B: oh most definitely most definitely it's a hot dead issue 

8.75 10.25 A: yeah [mn] 

9.38 14.53 B: what should they do in iraq how do you bring democracy to a fuhrocracy type country 

14.17 17.00 A: yeah okay you go first [mn] 

16.31 21.69 B: okay well since i have i've got prior military experience and i have been in that part of the world 

21.10 22.14 A: okay 

21.68 35.99 B: i find it to be a very interesting concept because they do they did those tho iraq is a country that's used to being controlled by an individual by a military monarch if you ever notice when you see pictures of presidents 

31.71 32.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

35.90 48.62 B: and leaders of countries in the united states they wear a suit in britain they wear a suit in japan they wear a suit in north korea they wear a military uniform in iraq they wear a military uniform in iran 

37.00 37.93 A: mhm 

45.29 46.34 A: (( okay i )) 

47.28 49.21 A: never would have caught that 

48.79 49.84 B: yes 

49.22 50.84 A: (( mhm i see what you mean )) 

50.39 65.13 B: all right so now this guy saddam hussein regardless of how anybody feels about him he was the main focal poi- point of hate in that country so you have these various people the shiite muslims the sunni muslims and you have the kurdish people 

59.41 60.60 A: (( mhm )) 

64.87 66.01 A: mhm 

65.43 68.09 B: so those three groups of people hated him 

68.22 80.43 B: in essence so he kept the country under control because they had one common enemy now that he's displaced for america to continue to stay there they're going to have to find a way to placate all those three different groups of people 

72.07 73.02 A: right 

80.44 83.59 B: b- before we become the hated enemy 

80.67 81.47 A: (( mhm )) 

83.34 84.36 A: (( i see )) 

84.20 85.73 B: okay go ahead 

85.86 90.14 A: well [laughter] w- what is your opinion then on 

89.76 100.95 B: well my my opinion on my on the reality of for it is that is being that they already went up they already went in there so you know you can't we can't undo it 

100.35 101.65 A: right 

101.01 106.43 B: but what they're going to have to do is they're going to have to wind up staying there a lot longer than they anticipate staying there because 

105.78 106.58 A: (( okay )) 

106.63 115.06 B: the shiites make up sixty percent of the country but they never contro- they never controlled it saddam hussein's people controlled it and he's a sunni muslim 

110.87 111.82 A: i see 

114.88 126.97 B: and they only make up like fifteen percent of the country they have cut out with the kurdish people that they that uh th- they cut out with the kurdish people that was their buffer between the shiites the kurds and the sunnis 

127.12 140.35 B: so i'm looking at it from from the perspective that since we've already went in there the only thing to do is to place the best government as possible in place but therein therein lies the rub of your problem when you place a government in another country 

134.53 135.66 A: mhm 

140.58 142.72 B: what happens to the people that live there 

142.73 143.47 A: (( mhm )) 

142.85 155.34 B: does that does that they already have enough resentment against this country anyway does it help the resentment build or does it placate the resentment because just because you're the biggest bully on the block at this point in time and the strongest person on the block 

146.18 147.42 A: right 

154.70 156.29 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

155.62 164.29 B: people fear the strong and after a while they start to resent the strong and then they find ways they wanna find ways to make the strong topple or to bring them down 

165.06 165.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

166.41 169.15 B: so my opinion is that they already went in there 

169.18 182.79 B: try to put the best government as possible in place that the the majority of the people will follow or listen to and then you step back but remember that you're going to have to go back in there at some other point in time if the shiites decide they want to take over the country 

182.45 184.79 A: so you're going to have to please them the rest of 

184.50 191.66 B: y- y- you have to please them the rest of the way remember you've got three groups of people that had a focal point of hate 

189.23 189.86 A: (( mm )) 

191.25 192.38 A: (( yeah well )) 

191.89 199.38 B: that was saddam hussein now their focal of hate has gone so the the animosity that they have towards each other 

193.39 194.27 A: (( h- right is )) 

196.21 196.91 A: (( is )) 

198.78 199.80 A: (( surfacing now )) 

200.77 204.46 A: yeah well how are you so knowledgeable in all this [mn] 

204.04 204.89 B: (( mm )) 

204.50 207.64 A: how are you so knowledgeable in all this the people groups and the 

207.25 221.12 B: yeah well i i spent i spent eight years in the military service and i w- i was like special a special type of soldier so i had an opportunity of going into these different countries and training when america was on the side of iraq when they fought against iran 

210.47 211.53 A: okay 

216.45 217.43 A: okay 

221.20 222.66 B: [laughter] the 

221.95 223.76 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

222.98 229.47 B: sort of weapons of mass destruction that they've always are said to have were not something that they produced on their own 

229.23 240.13 B: it was something that was supplied to them by friendly western countries to maintain the fight against communism and all that other good stuff because russia backed iran in that war 

232.97 233.95 A: yeah 

239.68 240.62 A: (( okay )) 

240.24 241.24 B: yes 

241.33 242.93 B: so what is your opinion 

242.49 244.16 A: (( [mn] well )) 

244.76 252.04 A: uh i guess like you said now that they're there they need to finish what they started although it's 

252.93 255.14 A: [mn] i don't know [mn] 

255.24 265.28 B: well you see that's the great thing about america we're able to fight for like uh som- uh intangible thing i- a- ideal 

255.39 256.16 A: i 

262.92 264.11 A: mhm 

264.73 265.86 A: right 

265.71 273.22 B: but they fight for rea- you know th- they're saying this is something tangible that you have to have my particular belief 

270.38 271.38 A: yeah 

273.07 282.94 B: or you have to have my particular faith see so it's slightly different so when y- w- w- w- if i want a good soldier in a fox hole with me i want an american soldier because we we nuts 

282.62 284.00 A: [laughter] 

283.42 285.24 B: (( [laughter] y- we nuts )) 

284.76 286.13 A: (( yeah )) 

285.26 299.52 B: you see they have a specific ideal they're fighting for you know they have a jihad that's a holy war you know they have a name for each thing that they do so when you deal with iss- when you deal with things like that you have to really think about it because 

288.62 289.19 A: (( [noise] )) 

290.98 291.93 A: yeah 

299.93 304.20 B: the the people that believe like that they'll jump off a roof for their belief 

303.44 305.84 A: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah it's nuts 

305.91 307.16 A: (( [mn] )) 

307.56 310.66 B: or explode themselves i mean think about it now 

307.68 308.39 A: huh 

309.31 311.42 A: exactly yeah [noise] 

310.77 316.17 B: when i was in vietnam i used to watch the tibetan monks that were against the war 

315.88 316.89 A: okay 

316.19 317.86 B: set themselves on fire 

317.78 318.65 A: (( oh )) 

318.07 326.42 B: and they would not move i mean if i thought i was burning my hand i would be hollering and screa- they set themselves on fire and stayed right into that position until their body fall over 

322.76 323.36 A: yeah 

326.02 328.75 A: how can you have such a strong 

328.79 330.15 A: for anything 

330.39 331.00 A: [mn] 

330.52 333.01 B: well look look at the conditions of 

333.13 338.83 B: in america we never can we'll never be poor or hungry because there's there's you know things in place to take care of us 

337.72 339.44 A: right yeah 

338.71 351.31 B: in countries like that you have the ruling class or the ruling party that controls all the money doles it out only to those that they think they can placate or put on their sides and this is how iraq was running all these years 

342.70 343.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

350.88 351.81 A: (( yeah )) 

351.07 353.91 B: this is how most of those countries run in 

353.87 363.45 B: euro asia or mic- or asia minor that's how most of the countries most of the countries run so since they run like that when you want to introduce an 

356.82 357.67 A: (( yeah )) 

363.30 375.23 B: entirely brand new system yes some people will embrace it because the capitalism aspect will come into place they want money but now you st- so what you now you do you create three different classes of people 

370.31 370.89 A: (( mm )) 

375.05 389.84 B: the ruling class they're slightly out of power but they're going to still have a little power in there those that are strongest from the weakest of the people to grab on to hold onto things and you still have the weaker set of people so you still haven't solved your problem [laughter] 

388.21 398.49 A: yeah but do you think when we went over there that that you know our government didn't realise th- how long this is gonna take a commitment for or 

397.83 405.02 B: well they realised that but they they not supposed to talk about that the only thing they're supposed to talk about is quick victory and 

404.34 405.62 A: why is that 

405.04 409.38 B: not too many deaths because who wants to discuss the aftermath 

408.76 410.10 A: yeah i guess 

409.76 414.54 B: because then once you discuss if you discuss the aftermath before the before 

414.62 420.67 B: [mn] what happens is the people say well wait a minute why are we going over there if we have to wind up staying there that long 

420.23 421.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

420.76 431.73 B: well you see but now you had a tangible target osama bin laden was floating around they say he's on a hundred and twenty first street in harlem selling video tapes but i don't know if that's true [laughter] 

430.08 433.18 A: [mn] i haven't heard that [mn] 

431.95 446.56 B: yeah well now you have a person you have a person saddam hussein running the government so you have a person that's in place so you can actually go in there and do something so you see we're fighting the war against terrorism do they have to fight a war against terrorism yes 

441.29 442.13 A: yeah 

446.85 450.42 B: is can a war against terrorism be won not really 

449.81 451.27 A: not really no 

450.88 456.54 B: you can make you could you could dampen it for a while but people simmer festering spirits 

453.78 454.81 A: right 

455.90 457.14 A: yeah 

456.54 467.16 B: the little kids they carry a._k. forty sevens five and six and seven years old ala akbad jihad kill the jew kill an american kill the infidels 

458.97 459.73 A: wow 

466.60 467.97 A: that's unreal 

467.89 468.76 B: yes 

468.33 469.76 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

469.39 484.23 B: yes but it's similar to the sub cultures that we have here in the united states people that call themselves outlaws and thugs i- it's really no difference it's it's that belief their particular belief that the the world c- this 

476.03 477.09 A: yeah 

478.40 479.58 A: (( i guess [mn] )) 

484.30 491.13 B: the world owes me everything and since they're not going to give it to me i'm going to take it [laughter] yes 

485.66 486.51 A: right 

488.39 490.81 A: how ever way i have to yeah 

491.18 502.10 B: but um and and um the my son is over there anyway in iraq he's a marine he'll be coming home say i i heard from him a couple of weeks ago he'll be coming home in about another month 

495.16 496.75 A: oh really 

501.37 502.88 A: oh oh 

502.20 504.54 B: he's in special forces with the marines 

504.34 513.97 B: he's seen a little bit of action i'm i was in vietnam so you know the military runs in the family so i i sort of look at these things from all different aspects 

510.65 511.62 A: yeah 

513.74 521.39 B: the only thing i could see that's really good about it now is when they did the insertion and they they went into iraq the loss of soldiers was very light 

520.80 521.66 A: (( yes )) 

521.48 530.19 B: it was very light and you could see that when this country was built up as being all this terrorism and powerful and stuff that these soldiers were literally surrendering 

529.85 530.91 A: yeah 

530.31 543.51 B: so now it makes you really look like the bully on the block because you go in there and everybody's running down the street hey i wanna surrender feed me feed me i need water i need water [laughter] you know so it was like but the thing was is that you did have that one small section 

534.73 535.69 A: (( [mn] )) 

536.55 537.65 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

543.50 549.61 B: in that i think they did the best saying look if we're only going in there to get this particular group 

549.38 550.29 A: yeah 

549.74 564.42 B: we're not going in there to mess with anybody else that precision bomber was pretty good but i know no no bomb is one hundred percent precision because that's the bomb is a mindless thing regardless of whether it's hooked up to a computer or not [laughter] 

555.89 556.96 A: (( right )) 

560.73 562.31 A: yeah yeah 

563.52 564.51 A: (( yeah )) 

564.44 565.64 B: (( yeah ))

569.48 574.96 B: oh thank you very much but i mean i i live here so that's part of i think i think that's part of the free
