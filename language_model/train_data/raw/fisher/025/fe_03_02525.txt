31.37 32.18 A: it's 

32.91 36.74 A: i i watched a little of the first survivor but 

36.79 39.46 A: [mn] it just doesn't interest me i don't know 

39.25 45.04 B: yeah me neither i think um first of all i think it's gotten totally out of hand 

45.16 46.17 A: yeah 

45.46 58.53 B: like it [mn] was [mn] it was i guess real world m._t._v. whatever that started as some one thing no actually you know when it first started i did watch it um for a second because you know it was new and it was interesting whatever 

58.24 59.40 A: right 

58.61 66.46 B: um and it was somewhat real not even that real but that's the whole thing about them is that they're not really that 

66.61 69.87 B: (( it's [mn] to me you've you've captured like )) 

70.39 73.61 B: point five percent of america you know what i'm saying 

73.23 79.94 A: exactly exactly they and they pick and choose who gets on i think they manipulate who wins too 

79.33 80.81 B: (( totally )) 

80.46 81.49 A: (( you know )) 

80.94 84.11 B: totally and that's just these people and they have like 

84.25 91.40 B: i don't know not the people that i'm around they're number one goal in life is not money and sex you know and that's 

89.41 91.22 A: absolutely 

91.19 103.09 B: the only kind of people they portray everybody's out to like get each other everybody's out to like do each other and like kill each other for money and it's just kind of crazy like th- they really ruin people [laughter] like that 

103.07 111.07 A: yeah and i think the new ones with uh [mn] married by america and joe that's kind of that's dangerous 

108.53 113.06 B: oh my god that's gross yeah wait no which one which one 

112.72 116.78 A: um married by a millionaire and joe 

113.76 114.84 B: married 

115.72 117.79 B: yeah yeah 

116.95 123.15 A: it's [laughter] the whole concept of commitment goes right [laughter] out the window you know 

122.88 124.23 B: (( totally )) 

124.41 127.91 A: so yeah i agree i watched big brother the first one 

128.00 129.07 B: okay 

128.37 133.25 A: and i liked that but then after that even that got really cheesy 

132.83 136.46 B: right i think i watched survivor like once but then 

136.61 143.46 B: it's like one either it's all being set up and people are just whatever getting 

143.94 146.67 B: paid like they're doing a script or whatever 

146.80 147.78 A: right 

146.84 153.25 B: and if that's the case then that's really sad and if it's not the case then that's still really sad [laughter] because 

153.47 165.85 B: if really i mean if you're willing to like have your life taped to like go on some t._v. show and like just act like an asshole i don't know that's kind of [lipsmack] sad and then if you're willing to get married off or 

164.61 165.47 A: [laughter] 

165.74 168.72 B: you know [mn] you know which one is it where it's um 

168.94 183.02 B: one guy and he gets to eliminate like he gets like ten girls and then slow- or i guess they do a but he just gets to eliminate them and they compete for him and like they tell ea- on each other some something [laughter] 

176.71 177.61 A: yeah 

181.90 193.40 A: exactly exactly i know and you know [mn] all the girls that they pick for all of these shows have the perfect bodies it perpetuates that myth that we all have to look a certain way 

183.23 185.13 B: (( no and )) 

189.95 191.67 B: right 

193.14 200.60 B: exactly and that we all sounded like and the majority of them yeah it's also interesting because the majority of them are white women 

194.17 194.90 A: (( in )) 

196.84 197.56 A: (( [mn] )) 

200.63 201.56 A: uh-huh 

200.87 209.54 B: and white men i don't know it's just this image of like the average and this is what people think this is what people do this is how they are and 

209.58 219.93 B: that that these women that that in reality all these like women are like willing to just like throw out like female bonds just for a man you know and just 

219.58 220.89 A: exactly 

220.30 228.06 B: drool after him like that like just like he's some big huge prize and not even good look- i don't know [laughter] it's just crazy 

227.39 233.25 A: well in the one he they told 'em they lied they told all the girls that he had all this money 

233.19 234.86 B: (( yeah what was that )) 

233.41 236.80 A: i can't remember which one it was but 

235.21 239.83 B: it's i think it was joe millionaire and he ended up being like a construction worker or something 

237.10 238.54 A: yeah 

239.35 241.38 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

240.50 248.86 B: was that but was that like was that part of the t._v. show that they find out they lied or was that like news coverage later on that he lied or 

247.74 248.69 A: (( no )) 

248.87 256.21 A: they said in the commercials all the way in the beginning that they that it was [mn] all a farce that he was a a construction worker 

254.77 256.64 B: oh 

256.86 258.76 A: but the girls didn't know it 

257.32 258.52 B: (( whoa )) 

258.92 260.71 B: oh i did not know that 

260.75 261.94 A: (( yeah )) 

260.93 263.54 B: (( that is crazy )) 

263.22 266.87 A: to me that's like fraud right off the top you know 

265.57 268.17 B: yeah basically basically 

267.94 270.33 A: but it was funny the girls' reaction 

270.74 274.39 A: how it varied from girl to girl as far as you know 

274.98 276.20 B: right 

275.37 279.31 A: what what they thought about that if they were in it for the money or 

279.48 280.89 B: yeah 

280.88 282.50 A: but i don't know 

281.46 289.43 B: i don't know and i swear there was one i may have just imagined this okay where literally they try to hurt each other like 

289.76 302.31 B: it's like this mystery and one person's going to i didn't i didn't understand it do you know what i'm talking about 'cause you can't kill i mean you can't kill people on i mean you can't do it but yet the way the commercial was setting it up was like 

293.07 294.88 A: yeah i think i remember 

302.39 315.93 B: one person's out to get everybody but can they get them first and literally people are like screaming like there's like blood in the commercials it's out of control and i was just like you know what this is like an american sickness right here like 

316.08 318.34 B: it's not funny you know what i mean 

317.97 320.07 A: (( ex- [mn] absolutely yes )) 

319.30 333.33 B: like there's all these great topics in the world there's all this stuff happening there's all these important things that we could talk about all these productive ways that we can use t._v. yet we're using it to watch each other like go to the bathroom go to a nightclub 

333.20 339.75 B: have a petty argument like that's and then and people get off watching this stuff as if nothing's going on in the world you know 

337.17 338.09 A: right 

339.42 342.19 A: i know and see who can be eliminated that's 

341.65 343.94 B: exactly exactly 

342.65 350.13 A: i i very seldom watch network t._v. usually it's history or discovery channel or 

350.16 352.17 A: one of the news channels or 

350.84 353.07 B: yeah 

352.22 355.57 A: very very seldom do i watch network t._v. anymore 

355.17 368.48 B: no it's yeah now it's it's just at its worst i feel you 'cause i um [lipsmack] i'm a first year law student and i'm broke partially why i'm doing this [laughter] you know and so i don't even have a t._v. actually ha 

368.04 369.08 A: oh 

369.16 378.51 B: so [mn] my god when i'm over at somebody's house or whatever i just like i smell that stuff and i just turn it off i really can't stand it like 

378.60 391.20 B: it's just not that interesting it's really not after a while it's really predictable and it's all the same story different twist you know like survivor and then survivor on a boat and then survivor on a raft [laughter] you know 

388.51 389.41 A: (( absolutely )) 

389.87 399.75 A: yeah exactly you know then the [mn] there was this one a friend of mine watches where they set 'em up on dates blind date and they like totally mismatch 'em

409.41 411.10 B: (( yuk )) 

410.81 413.79 A: it's just really bad taste you know

485.14 486.54 B: that's cool 

486.77 493.28 B: yeah i don't know i'm trying to think of another one that i watched i honestly real world if i had to pick if i had to watch one 

492.95 494.31 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

493.66 497.55 B: i guess because it was at that time it just 

497.60 508.89 B: it was the least exaggerated i think they as pathetic as it kind of was already like they started with they had some kind of mission that they did or something like that they all like one was a doctor one was you know what i mean 

508.46 509.72 A: right 

509.10 513.63 B: they weren't just people i mean just whatever random people it was like very 

514.56 519.11 B: whatever exotified kind of jobs or you know what i mean 

518.70 520.73 A: right right 

519.45 530.07 B: they were just kind of sort of normal people who i mean i i know i know people that you know tried out for that like in our university auditions or whatever like they would come to universities and 

530.23 533.94 B: people would just do it just to like make some money get famo- whatever 

533.68 534.61 A: uh-huh 

534.24 541.28 B: but um [lipsmack] yeah i remember like the first one it was that guy who had aids pedro and then 

541.47 554.46 B: he actually died like during or like after the t._v. show i don't know there was something more real about it there was something more you know we're going to use this space to like talk about real issues or something something that takes thought 

554.46 555.42 A: right 

554.56 562.94 B: [laughter] and brain cells um [lipsmack] and then yeah people hooked up or whatever but for the most part it was 

555.81 557.00 A: right 

563.18 571.67 B: kind of regular i mean it's funny 'cause at the time i i didn't think so but now comparing it to all these random other things i feel like okay 

571.71 574.19 B: maybe that was actually great [laughter] 

573.68 576.98 A: [laughter] yeah yeah i know 

575.09 584.32 B: you know and like road rules was one and they you know actually had like missions and tried to figure stuff out or whatever you know 

585.33 588.23 A: yeah anymore it's just how how 

588.30 594.89 A: what can we think of how can we get the shock factor elevated you know and i 

591.70 592.80 B: yeah 

593.82 596.67 B: but it's weird to me that people still fall for it 'cause it's 

596.50 597.64 A: (( know )) 

596.69 599.89 B: so old now it's so like okay i'm gonna
