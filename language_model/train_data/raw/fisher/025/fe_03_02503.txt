77.31 90.29 A: oh i used to watch that last year but um or two years ago but then i just i got really busy with school so i stopped and um i don't know i think the bachelor's really interesting it's cute it's funny and i don't know i wonder if he's really going to marry the woman at the end 

78.93 79.78 B: mhm 

89.75 94.31 B: [laughter] i don't know all the [mn] i i watched uh i guess the bachelorette i watched that one

101.88 109.21 A: that uh you and i just talking about reality t._v. for this oh okay so what else can we talk about um [lipsmack] do you find it realistic 

104.30 105.97 B: yeah that's all it is 

107.03 107.77 B: we 

109.86 110.91 B: um 

111.08 113.98 B: painfully so [laughter] you know 

113.54 118.06 A: do you think uh they're fr- like [mn] any of it's scripted by hollywood or by the directors [mn] 

118.32 120.36 B: uh i'd like to think not 

120.19 124.06 A: neither do i but somehow i just don't think that it's natural 

123.77 137.36 B: yeah well yeah i'm sure of the i'm sure that they're directed somehow um you know i mean if they like if if they go off tangent or something it may be they may somehow throw something in to direct it a a different way just like they do on survivor you know when things are going wrong 

127.29 128.75 A: (( yeah or scripted )) 

134.30 135.19 A: right 

137.25 142.32 B: they'll they'll change the make up of the of the of the um tribes or something like that 

141.58 146.35 A: yeah yeah or um what else have i watched oh american idol's a reality 

145.61 147.92 B: yeah i think that's a reality show too 

147.13 148.71 A: yeah i think so and that 

147.94 151.27 B: and i what i'm i'm hooked on that one too [mn] 

150.69 154.38 A: and they're having a canadian idol actually and i'm going to try out for it 'cause i sing 

153.98 156.34 B: oh terrific i'll look for you 

154.73 155.63 A: yeah 

156.11 157.97 A: oh thanks [laughter] 

156.62 158.24 B: [laughter] 

158.32 167.17 A: so what else about reality t._v. i find it more interesting than regular t._v. just because it's it's [mn] like real it's real people and not actors or actresses 

160.00 160.98 B: um 

165.79 166.68 B: well 

167.08 175.87 B: but yeah that's that's that's one one way to look at it too and and uh like old sitcoms and i i do watch a lot of television i'm i live alone right now and i watch a lot of t._v. 

175.47 176.50 A: oh yeah 

175.87 182.82 B: um but i ended up they all they're all the same stories over and over and over and this one you you do find something different going on 

182.70 189.03 A: yeah i like um the fact that it's a creative [mn] nobody's ever done it before and it's just such this new phenomenon going on 

188.59 198.47 B: but you know i think it [mn] originally all started in europe in england and yeah it started in europe a lot of these things they're they were a little more drastic than we with nudity and all that 

192.19 193.27 A: oh really 

198.20 199.19 A: mhm 

198.56 209.41 B: but it did start there the original survivor the idea for that and a few which surprised me [laughter] we always look like to think that we in north america are above it all right [laughter] 

201.91 202.79 A: (( mhm mm )) 

207.05 208.08 A: are the first 

208.14 216.95 A: actually i think i think it's europe that actually is the first for everything they have the new the newest music the newest technology which is interesting 'cause people don't know that about europe 

213.47 214.74 B: right mhm 

217.43 222.30 A: [lipsmack] but um wha- did you see uh survivor a couple of years ago with like a 

221.71 226.35 B: i didn't see the very first one except for the last um the last one 

226.12 227.25 A: oh really 

226.81 230.95 B: and then so then i said that was interesting then i started watching 'em since then 

231.10 238.66 A: um i find it it hooks me in you know like i'll watch it and i'll want more and more like whereas other t._v. programs i i find it fake 

232.97 233.63 B: (( mm )) 

238.31 243.80 B: right and i i put it on i put it on to on to tape 'cause i'm afraid i'll miss it [laughter] 

242.80 249.61 A: yeah like it's addictive you know like i definitely prefer reality shows like definitely oh have you watched extreme makeover 

247.01 247.90 B: mhm 

249.59 253.51 B: [sigh] last night was the first time because it happened to be on right after the bachelor 

252.85 254.26 A: how good is that 

254.23 260.33 B: i [mn] i mean that was freaky that that was freak- i don't know well you know it 

256.45 257.85 A: isn't that crazy 

260.46 266.32 B: just to submit yourself to such pain but actually how else are you going to get it something like that done 

265.83 268.65 A: you can't it's [mn] yeah it's crazy 

266.34 268.99 B: for free i'm sure it's for free 

268.87 276.05 A: well it's like a real it's it's unbelievable like that is an a crazy show like i saw it with my boyfriend he was like dying over it 

275.47 282.44 B: yeah i i that's the first i'd heard about it but i never th- you know [mn] as it happened to be on the same station as what was before the bachelor 

282.10 283.04 A: mhm 

282.67 286.81 B: right which was you know after something else that i happened to be watching 

287.65 298.13 A: yeah it's it all comes to like you you get the like they're all after one and the aft- after the other pretty much like you watch one then the ones after and then aft- like it's you just sit in front of your t._v. it's make it very convenient 

296.45 303.41 B: mhm actually there's a station coming out a new t._v. um station that will be all reality t._v. 

303.06 306.64 A: oh really that's so cool i wonder if they're going to have that here 

303.74 304.54 B: yeah 

305.00 308.38 B: the first thing right the first thing that they're making is 

308.45 311.53 B: uh a story about reality t._v. how it came to be 

311.21 312.22 A: wow 

311.63 319.92 B: and now that it and they'll be showing reruns of all the all the reality programs until they get themselves going and then i guess they'll have some of their own 

314.35 315.74 A: (( do you do you )) 

319.59 325.39 A: what do you know if the t- the reality t._v. people are actors that get paid like hollywood actors do 

325.42 332.56 B: i don't know i just [mn] they have to i was thinking that like in at least in the survivor as as long as you stay you probably get a little bit of money 

332.58 333.73 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

332.67 334.56 A: i think so yeah 

334.19 338.37 B: i don't think they would do it for free i think they do get some money but i don't know 

338.22 340.68 A: and do they really starve them on survivor 

340.08 347.18 B: they probably well i i tell you i did find something out that's really interesting i was in california doing a workout class and in california 

345.19 346.18 A: mhm 

347.21 360.81 B: the the my the te- the instructor was uh um [lipsmack] her husband was a producer of one of the survivor in africa w- australia and she went along with him and she was the um workout person for the for the people there 

355.04 356.01 A: mhm 

360.40 361.40 A: oh yeah 

361.06 366.09 B: so i guess so they wouldn't die i mean she actually worked out with them like once or twice a day 

366.29 367.48 A: wow 

367.23 376.95 B: so that shows that they it's not totally um i mean obviously there's lots of things that they don't film or they don't show but i guess to keep them uh ali- you know going 

376.99 379.27 A: well they can't starve them it's impossible 

377.01 378.62 B: they have things like that 

378.95 384.64 B: yeah i mean they watch em su- i'm sure they doctor them and make sure that they're not going to you know um fall away 

383.74 386.37 A: because like how can you keep your morale up how can you 

385.49 388.63 B: well just uh [mn] um fear factor 

389.14 390.56 B: have you watched that one 

389.15 392.34 A: oh i've seen that a couple of times that's scary 

391.69 398.19 B: when they put the rats that got me very first one when they had the rats [laughter] oh and they have to eat stuff i gag 

394.09 395.18 A: (( ew )) 

398.08 399.97 A: ew what what happened with the rats 

399.64 403.29 B: that was the very first one they had to lay 'em in a crate and they dumped 

403.74 409.99 B: uh uh like uh i don't know twelve pounds of rats on top of them and they had to stay in this crate with the rats nibbling at them 

409.94 411.91 A: the rats literally like bit them
