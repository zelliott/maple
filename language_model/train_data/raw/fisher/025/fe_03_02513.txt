190.43 192.03 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

191.20 194.71 B: what what you say is so true that you know that's not the qual-

196.56 197.93 A: (( mm mhm )) 

199.81 204.71 A: now they they call this reality t._v. and i'm not sure that's that's so real 

205.19 208.10 A: you know you look at some of those shows that they have 

206.99 209.57 B: you know you got a point that's not reality 

209.01 210.11 A: no 

209.72 211.31 B: they call it that 

210.66 211.91 A: yes 

211.96 213.82 B: the only reality show 

214.36 222.13 B: that i can actually stomach is because i don't have cable i have to watch [laughter] various things is fox has one for children 

222.53 226.57 B: where where they're on the island and they have to compete in different little things 

226.19 227.20 A: oh 

226.83 231.05 B: for their group to stay but it it they're educational things 

231.35 232.28 B: you know 

231.57 234.98 A: mm my grandchildren are too young for that right now but 

234.15 243.75 B: yeah this this is more for like nine or ten year olds i guess maybe like up to thirteen but they all have to do different little challenges and they're usually they're athletic or 

236.79 237.76 A: yeah 

243.94 247.36 B: based on you know like educational things 

247.58 249.39 B: now that i think is okay 

249.22 256.12 A: well then you can see that what one person is strong in one time they may be weak in something else 

255.67 256.66 B: right 

256.21 266.18 A: you know but that's not as- you know [mn] reality t._v. it builds no sense of community i mean it's not anybody helping raise the village helping raise a child kind of a thing 

261.27 262.17 B: yeah 

266.20 267.35 A: they're all 

267.61 269.44 A: vicious to each other 

269.00 281.89 B: well yeah that's [mn] the one thing that i noticed with those shows even though i don't really watch 'em but you know people at work talk about 'em or whatever it's usually the worst individuals who win those with the least morals and values 

279.30 280.46 A: mhm 

281.31 282.38 A: mhm 

282.68 289.51 B: and are the most vindictive or manipulative or lie or whatever and i'm like now what does that accomplish 

288.99 290.06 A: mhm 

290.71 291.79 B: i don't know 

290.78 298.49 A: and we want to raise a whole generation who thinks that competitiveness is is a a real plus 

298.22 299.20 B: yeah 

299.81 301.89 B: you know it it does worry me about 

301.91 306.20 B: about kids and the things they see and with games and everything it doesn't really teach 

304.77 305.78 A: mhm 

306.29 308.08 B: a lot of the values 

307.47 308.57 A: mhm 

308.17 310.95 B: [mn] i was raised in a pretty traditional family 

311.09 316.62 B: you know and things like lying and cheating and being mean wasn't tolerated 

316.64 318.70 A: no much less praised 

318.30 319.34 B: yeah

361.41 362.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

365.27 366.22 A: mhm 

366.24 368.84 B: and then you wonder how much is scripted too

387.85 390.51 A: you know and who's being manipulated then 

390.75 396.32 A: are the viewers the ones that are really getting the short sh- short shaft as it were 

396.20 402.02 B: yeah you know and then you see some of the people who are on the show and afterwards they're like they feel manipulated 

401.45 402.95 A: mhm mhm 

402.25 403.46 B: and it's like well 

403.67 405.11 B: why not question 

405.56 407.48 B: why they want to be 

408.06 413.66 B: why they want as much attention to be on national t._v. you know it's like well what did you expect

431.82 434.98 B: nail salon that's owned by a vietnamese family 

435.28 440.85 B: you know and most of the immigrants or whatever work really hard to you know try to make a living 

441.11 453.50 B: and they happened to have the t._v. show on fear factor and i asked them i was like what do you think of that and they just laughed and shook their heads and i was like would you do any of that if it were a whole lot of money and they were like no of course not 

453.01 454.32 A: mhm 

453.63 456.55 B: you know and they just thought it it was bizarre 

456.76 458.23 B: and i'm like you know 

459.00 463.49 B: maybe americans are as greedy as we all think we are [laughter] i don't know that's so bad 

463.44 472.21 A: yeah and some of these families that are immigrating in look at our families and they feel that they have a stronger sense of family than we do [lipsmack] 

471.98 473.39 B: isn't that true 

473.43 475.77 A: and isn't that sad 

473.44 474.02 B: what 

475.03 477.55 B: what part of um florida are you in 

477.48 479.84 A: uh melbourne it's on the east coast

486.42 487.62 B: oh okay 

487.95 491.13 B: yeah like we have a large hispanic population here 

491.36 492.31 B: and 

492.55 493.38 B: you know 

494.13 502.61 B: they all tend to live with their grandparents or whatever and you know they wouldn't put their grandparents in a nursing home you know it's just not their culture they don't think 

496.00 497.02 A: mhm 

500.29 501.13 A: no 

502.64 503.76 B: that way 

503.46 504.53 A: yeah 

504.41 511.98 B: and you know it's kind of refreshing to see people who actually spend a lot of time with their family and you know that's more the focus 

512.22 514.60 B: they don't drop their kids at day care [laughter] you know 

513.98 516.07 A: no [laughter] [laughter] 

514.68 516.34 B: or [laughter] whatever 

516.87 518.71 B: yeah it it really 

519.32 521.30 B: can be a little discouraging 

521.55 524.62 A: but i think some of the respect for the elderly 

524.55 525.57 B: yeah 

524.92 530.05 A: is really great and of course these reality t._v. shows have none of that sort of thing 

529.81 533.08 B: well no there there's no substance or quality or 

533.17 534.96 B: or ethics 

534.37 536.76 A: it's every person for themselves 

536.30 546.91 B: yeah i know like p._b._s. did a reality show where they had um a family go back in time and live like you would've lived if you were in the like mid eighteen hundreds 

546.39 547.46 A: (( oh )) 

547.36 553.00 B: and i caught a couple episodes of that where they actually had to chop wood and not have electricity and 

552.22 553.37 A: mhm 

553.09 557.43 B: you know wash their hair with with like bar soap and 

556.75 558.58 A: lice soap yeah 

557.92 565.71 B: you know and and they went into it thinking oh this is going to be so fun and rustic and after three days they were like you want me to eat what 

562.31 563.31 A: mhm 

565.66 566.90 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [mn] )) 

566.32 567.37 B: (( you [laughter] know )) 

567.58 580.39 B: and it i don't know it really made you appreciate the things you take for granted you know the luxuries that that you know running water and things we deal with everyday that we don't really appreciate as much as you know we would if we 

572.15 573.27 A: yes 

581.00 583.58 B: went through something like that 

582.70 585.58 A: and i think that's good for kids to see 

585.47 589.00 B: yeah i think so too like as a kid i always went camping 

585.97 586.53 A: (( [mn] )) 

588.82 589.77 A: mhm 

589.58 596.30 B: you know and things like that i think it's it's really healthy for kids to be in the outdoors learn about nature 

596.59 599.31 B: get away from the t._v. and the games and
