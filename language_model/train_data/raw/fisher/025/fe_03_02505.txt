91.72 95.16 B: yeah they just got attitude they get to judge the people 

94.63 109.27 A: yeah but what i find is that television has been drifting towards that now you know more reality based television i think because it is not only cheaper because remember you'd have they'd have to pay all these high priced stars you know 

100.11 101.14 B: (( mhm )) 

105.04 105.81 B: (( [mn] )) 

107.73 111.24 B: yeah nobody wants to pay high prices 

110.67 123.54 A: ah that's it so you know for them it's it's like paying mexican workers [mn] yeah yeah right you know it's like dime a dozen they get anybody off the streets and just well it's good 

112.13 113.21 B: you know 

115.63 121.78 B: (( [laughter] pesos [laughter] [laughter] [mn] [laughter] )) 

122.08 125.57 B: and they just get them and set 'em up you know what i mean 

124.02 129.75 A: right right but then again it's good for for the ordinary civilian because 

128.84 130.18 B: yeah 

129.78 134.15 A: you know at least it gives them a chance at stardom you know what a lot of them they enjoy 

132.28 135.80 B: and they don't give a lot of people chances either 

135.08 142.91 A: that's right that's right and what i find is that they've been releasing a whole batch of stars you know like even like american idol 

136.73 137.83 B: and um 

140.35 141.81 B: oh my god

176.07 180.41 A: it comes on say between july and it ends like in september it's 

179.15 182.01 B: [mn] yeah if f- i i fo- uh 

180.45 186.07 A: a group of people that living under one roof for like two to three months 

184.94 190.74 B: oh see that that hasn't even been on in a while that has not been on in a while 

187.93 196.13 A: right yeah it comes on only in the summer time only the summer time it comes on this would be the i think the third or fourth one i think the fourth one 

190.85 192.35 B: yeah 

195.71 202.85 B: the fourth one yeah it's about the fourth because the last one i think uh was uh manual lewis and all them in the house 

196.61 197.82 A: yeah 

202.11 210.67 A: yeah yeah but it's fun and like i say it gives the ordinary person a chance at the yeah 

202.95 204.40 B: oh man 

207.95 212.96 B: just like soap opera soap operas are reality shows [laughter] 

211.79 219.33 A: [laughter] yeah but but i like the idea though i really like the concept of reality t._v. 

213.91 215.81 B: oh my god 

216.66 223.82 B: the idea's fine it gives people it gives people something else to laugh at besides you know troublemakers you know 

220.39 221.78 A: yeah 

222.20 227.27 A: mhm and it adds to our imagination and it it 

225.16 232.01 B: yeah and personality too [laughter] [laughter] 

227.23 237.86 A: mhm yeah yeah and i [laughter] yeah it just makes you wonder what is going to happen next you know it's it's not it's very unpredictable so it adds to the intensity 

233.54 235.14 B: oh my god 

235.38 239.28 B: and sometimes you can figure it out [laughter] [laughter] 

237.88 245.08 A: yeah it adds to the intensity and the excitement it makes you wonder what next is going to be happening or who next is going to be kicked off the show or 

239.60 240.53 B: [laughter] 

244.43 246.48 B: oh that seventies show

274.61 281.84 A: yeah yeah yeah it's going to be getting a lot of advertisements meaning that they really shouldn't be running out of money to keep it on you know 

278.27 279.94 B: (( a lot )) 

281.32 290.94 B: oh man 'cause you just some reality television shows don't last long if they're like too good you know as you can't like be too good you know if you're too real they're gonna cut you off 

285.09 287.61 A: that's true that's true 

288.30 289.74 A: mhm 

290.44 303.14 A: absolutely [laughter] yeah that's true that's true because even all these talk shows that are like dime a dozen you see them on today and within a couple of months they're off i remember the show 

291.16 294.20 B: (( [laughter] )) 

295.33 296.29 B: [laughter] 

298.32 299.63 B: mhm 

302.88 303.87 B: mhm 

303.14 308.98 A: i mean that lady is so good she can really motivate her listeners and her audience and so on but 

308.72 309.78 B: yeah 

309.17 323.56 A: i remember i was like a part of her audience at one stage and i kept [mn] yeah it was it was okay you know i was just being like an extra and they told me that well then i was to ask some relevant questions they put me in the front row yeah and say just ask some questions but 

312.09 313.68 B: oh yeah that was cool 

317.38 318.48 B: (( mm )) 

320.33 321.64 B: [laughter] 

323.58 330.77 A: everytime i attended which was like once per week during her tenure i kept saying this show is not going to last 

330.24 340.16 B: [mn] yeah you are oh my god we sitting in front of the television like oh my god this is not going to last at all i'll give it about two weeks 

331.16 334.90 A: (( it was just too too clear cut and predictable )) 

336.48 339.12 A: (( yeah yeah and you see )) 

339.75 342.79 A: believe you me as you see them you can tell 

340.95 343.71 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

342.91 346.07 A: even the connie chung show all right she comes on c._n._n. 

344.24 345.98 B: oh my god 

345.93 359.91 A: and just yesterday i realised that she was off i hadn't seen her in a little while but then i you know i had said it was because of the war you know and then last night i heard it and um the recently canceled connie chung show and i said oh my god 

346.29 347.41 B: yeah 

352.12 353.49 B: yeah 

357.94 358.68 B: (( [mn] )) 

358.97 364.02 B: and you know she's married to maurie oh man yeah i watch that too 

360.57 364.88 A: right and he has his own talk show i was on that show too his show is good 

364.07 366.77 B: [laughter] his show makes me cry 

365.03 365.96 A: (( his show )) 

366.25 372.92 A: right [laughter] yeah because he's always featuring freaks of nature and some absurd topics what he's 

366.86 368.68 B: [laughter] 

370.23 371.45 B: (( mhm )) 

372.31 376.81 B: some people some people that don't know that they're going to be this way when they're born you know 

376.25 378.24 A: yeah that's true 

377.12 380.34 B: um i i [mn] i cry because of the fact you know 

379.86 382.75 A: uh-huh but you can still say that 

380.79 383.45 B: so he's a he's a good show he gets high ratings 

382.88 393.61 A: right but you can [mn] that too can be classified as reality t._v. because you know when the guests go on although they are being given leave you know like they're being given um 

387.09 388.23 B: mhm 

393.79 397.65 A: an order in which questions will be asked and how they should answer 

395.38 398.87 B: oh okay okay i never i never knew that 

398.02 406.08 A: yeah they are in most situations but what happen is that they are allowed to be flexible because sometimes they even show them cue cards and say st- 

404.81 407.13 B: just like they have to talk about a certain thing 

406.59 412.06 A: right right but sometimes they're allowed to be improvisational you know 

407.29 409.73 B: oh okay oh right 

411.79 413.02 B: uh-huh 

412.20 420.10 A: so i would put that uh i really classify that as reality t._v. too because sometimes when you watch them you realise whatever they're saying is what they really want to say you know 

418.78 426.23 B: yeah and sometimes whatever it's not everything on uh reality television that you agree with but sometimes you agree with it to the fullest extent too 

423.27 424.16 A: uh-huh 

425.32 427.34 A: yeah that's true 

426.30 433.61 B: you'd be like oh my god it hap- happened that that happened to somebody i know before or even thinking that you know like oh my god i'm seeing it 

430.08 432.39 A: (( absolutely ab- )) 

433.42 434.94 A: yeah 

434.01 435.81 B: i'm seeing it [laughter] 

435.10 448.94 A: absolutely but one one thing i've uh been observing too is that on these reality [mn] t._v. shows they make the people look so beautiful you know what i mean you know to me they really look like stars although they're just you know doing their little fifteen minute stint they look 

442.63 443.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

444.73 446.57 B: [laughter] 

447.68 448.31 B: (( mhm )) 

449.27 450.06 A: (( beautiful )) 

449.39 456.25 B: like joe millionaire and he didn't really have any money and now he has life from the guy who has no money [laughter] 

450.52 452.10 A: yeah 

453.30 462.80 A: i'll tell you oh my god i'm telling you but they really do make these people look beautiful like they look like stars you know 

460.17 461.57 B: (( mm )) 

461.92 463.15 B: (( i know )) 

462.70 472.59 A: even the bachelor and the bachelorette i've been watching those on who'd believe that these people are scraped up off the streets you know or who'd believe that they really audition for these kind of parts you know 

464.93 465.82 B: (( mm )) 

472.01 473.43 B: mhm 

472.63 481.31 A: yeah it's good though it's really i love the concept i really l- and i'm happy that they chose this topic because i really had a lot to talk about it 'cause i'm a t._v. freak [mn] 

475.64 477.29 B: (( yeah that's brilliant eh )) 

479.49 489.51 B: and i'm yeah and i know a lot of people yeah i do watch some i know people that don't even watch it and when i'm like talking about reality shows they'd be like i don't want to hear it i'm all like oh man you need to get in hip with it 

488.98 491.46 A: [laughter] 

489.56 495.24 B: because it's a lot of stuff you know that you need to listen to and learn you know some people don't know for what 

492.65 502.27 A: yeah that's true right that's true and they don't know when they might be into that position too or when they might see somebody that they identify on t._v. 

495.42 496.92 B: [laughter] 

498.02 504.64 B: uh [mn] mhm mhm everything is not what it seems on reality t._v. 

504.10 512.49 A: absolutely absolutely but at school the schools television is taking a new twist and i like the spontaneity of it all you know 

504.89 506.71 B: [laughter]
