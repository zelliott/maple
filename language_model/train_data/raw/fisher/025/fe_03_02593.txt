330.77 339.86 A: um yeah in college i did take my core classes but we never really even went into you know all the deep end you know discussing topics like this 

340.11 341.19 A: um 

341.59 344.09 A: just basically general stuff 

345.32 346.36 B: yeah 

345.44 347.89 A: yeah but i [lipsmack] um 

348.28 355.39 A: yeah i am against dis- disarming uh any foreign nation that is a a threat to the united states 

355.50 364.89 A: it doesn't matter who or where they're from it doesn't matter as long as it it's a threat you know it should be you know eradicated 

355.59 356.48 B: right 

364.27 367.90 B: yeah the problem is is they start but they never finish 

368.33 369.91 A: right 

369.00 373.98 B: they need to finish the job and get rid of all the weapons of 

374.26 380.28 B: i don't know if they have mass destruction because i haven't seen any at all so i have no idea if they have any 

380.43 387.21 B: or anything like that because i have not seen any evidence on t._v. but that's all i only watch the news once a day 

387.59 388.39 B: but 

387.74 399.92 A: well i'm i'm a big conspiracy theorist [laughter] and i believe that the media is uh is really just telling us one thing when the truth is another thing do you you what do you think about that 

399.95 407.14 B: uh well what i like is they're having the media with the troops in iraq why 

406.97 415.81 B: because they will now say it immediately oh this was a friendly fire they would have said oh we don't know yet the government will cover it up 

415.22 417.07 A: (( right )) 

416.08 426.71 B: but having the media there that made a difference of us knowing the facts in that situation but otherwise no the media they they say what they wanna say and they 

427.60 430.44 B: i don't know the way they describe 

430.88 433.51 B: (( the news it's so )) 

434.43 439.89 B: oh so much jolly instead of just say give me the facts misleading you're correct 

435.46 437.31 A: (( it it it's mis- )) 

439.13 441.61 A: it's misleading right 

441.00 449.17 B: uh just give me the facts and that's all i need to know but they start speculating and no i don't like that 

449.73 451.63 A: (( yeah )) 

450.26 453.35 B: i i like to know the facts and that's it 

453.50 460.18 A: yeah 'cause it's it's in the best interests of the media to project the vision that 

460.11 471.58 A: the united states is winning the war you know what i mean that we're we're doing our job we're winning this war and we're gonna bring the boys back home you know that's that's the image they have to project 

471.62 479.28 A: um on on t._v. on the news or whatever you know they they don't show you you know the babies being killed they don't show you 

479.17 487.12 A: you know the hospitals being burned they don't show you all the all the bad things that happen you know only visions of you know 

487.05 500.25 A: of soldiers winning the war and you know etcetera stuff like that that's what i think you know they're not they're not gi- they're not giving us the whole truth because it does does not benefit us it doesn't doesn't benefit the american public 

492.39 493.42 B: yeah but 

500.22 505.84 B: yeah but after vietnam you don't remember that you probably weren't even born [laughter] 

504.90 507.01 A: no [laughter] 

506.70 508.54 B: that's all they were showing 

508.88 510.18 A: yeah 

509.34 517.35 B: that they were showing only the sad things and we know the soldiers doing their job and it was a war that was never finished 

517.48 518.89 A: right 

518.68 520.67 B: but that's another 

520.14 523.73 A: that's another issue [laughter] 

521.38 525.64 B: that's another issue i don't wanna get into it because it annoys me 

525.75 528.87 B: my husband was there too [laughter] 

528.15 530.05 A: [laughter] oh man 

529.38 534.55 B: so all on the gulf war and all of that so it it's just horrible 

535.11 539.20 A: yeah [lipsmack] hm
