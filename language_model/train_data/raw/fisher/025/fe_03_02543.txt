148.46 151.51 B: situations and and people 

151.53 153.60 B: i don't know it's almost like a 

153.74 156.81 B: i've i've never been a soap opera watcher but 

157.78 159.69 B: i think maybe that's the reason that 

160.12 163.23 B: some people like op- soap operas it's the same thing it's it's 

164.11 165.46 B: you know these 

165.97 173.58 B: fantasies but it's like the opposite but it's it's like the opposite where a soap opera's a fantasy where somebody wants to be like it 

167.35 169.18 A: yeah 

170.21 175.13 A: [noise] they wanna be like that [laughter] yeah 

173.60 181.47 B: but the reality show is almost the opposite where you're like oh boy you know my life ain't so bad it's ah 

175.79 177.40 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

180.29 181.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

181.56 183.61 A: yeah 

182.39 185.37 B: because they're not ah things are not so tough 

185.26 187.47 A: yeah think so i agree with them [noise] 

187.47 191.58 B: i don't know but then like would would something like ah oprah 

188.62 189.72 A: so 

191.79 195.01 B: be considered a reality show or are they only talking about like 

192.52 193.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

194.53 196.49 A: (( [noise] um i )) 

196.75 204.73 A: don't know i think that's more like legitimate maybe more like it's a talk show like not so trashy maybe 

204.67 208.76 B: yeah i don't think that's i don't know i can't even i'm trying to think of the different 

207.70 208.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

208.95 211.81 B: (( um but then what about would like ah ))

423.06 424.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] hm )) 

424.53 432.57 B: i i i i don't know but obviously they they keep coming on because i remember years ago it was just that judge judy and then there's 

424.67 425.71 A: (( well )) 

426.92 428.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

429.20 431.08 A: yeah

441.66 444.74 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah but other than that else but )) 

444.80 450.40 A: yeah i think it'll probably like it can't go on like it'll probably stop sometime [noise] [noise] 

449.44 453.41 B: well it's like yeah 'cause you think like you have that survivor now i never 

453.70 457.48 B: i never really i saw like one or two 

457.70 464.93 B: my sister was all into it she just like yeah i'm like how do you have time to be wat- i don't even know what night it was on 

460.19 461.43 A: really 

464.72 466.80 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

465.45 466.36 B: i i don't 

466.55 473.42 B: i don't have time and um but people people get into it i don't know whether it just 

468.16 470.11 A: yeah 

473.13 474.55 A: (( [noise] i )) 

474.25 479.57 B: [noise] i almost think it just takes you out of your real life and you can focus on 

474.58 476.25 A: (( don't know [noise] )) 

479.30 483.15 A: [noise] you can see how other people act in real 

483.17 487.43 A: in reality situations and maybe you compare to you self 

485.52 489.58 B: yeah but are those really reality situations though i don't 

488.57 494.54 A: yeah they're probably not probably influenced by the camera of course but [noise] mhm [noise] 

492.97 495.29 B: know because then i think too like 

495.44 497.39 B: (( that survivor show )) 

497.46 499.71 B: like everyone on that island 

499.05 501.00 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

499.72 512.43 B: they're all like they had nothing to eat but like bugs or i mean whatever [mn] i guess they had like ten different ones but they had like bugs and raw fish and all this really nasty stuff and everyone still looked really good i'm like 

509.77 510.82 A: yeah 

511.18 511.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

512.51 518.69 B: i don't know i mean i i think i look pretty good but i think after that much time like i don't think i'd be looking so good like 

512.83 514.03 A: (( oh )) 

518.49 521.37 A: [noise] so you think they put like make up on them and stuff 

520.96 523.66 B: i don't know i think they don't pick 

521.58 522.17 A: (( [noise] )) 

524.78 531.46 B: in like that case that show like it like a geraldo or something oh it's real people all right they're real scary people but 

531.40 532.50 A: yeah 

531.47 533.78 B: i don't know then you think like that survivor like 

534.16 536.32 B: does everyone really look that 

536.29 549.62 B: you know would everyone really you or me or you know somebody else really look that good after that many weeks just eating some bugs and no having no soap to even wash and like you can't wash your hair 

544.49 546.72 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah )) 

549.44 552.90 A: yeah yeah i don't think so and fair enough 

550.23 551.51 B: and is this like 

553.53 557.64 A: see that's kind of unrealistic [laughter] 

553.61 554.97 B: (( [laughter] but um )) 

556.61 567.66 B: yeah i know but they did they still looked like really pretty good so i don't know that they have the average person and and either way they're not the average person it's either somebody that's 

560.75 561.93 A: yeah 

564.03 565.44 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

567.70 572.15 A: yeah they're usually good looking people or something like that 

570.05 576.00 B: right but then on the geraldo end it's you know somebody that's like has like a really sad life and 

575.45 576.92 A: [noise] oh yeah 

576.28 580.77 B: and you know not necessarily more attractive or less attractive but just 

580.87 581.91 B: you know 

582.70 583.90 B: people 

583.97 590.17 B: in really like sad situations whether they chose it sometimes or 

588.21 589.37 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

590.50 591.90 B: whether 

592.32 593.92 B: you know they 

594.67 596.54 B: (( i don't know whether they just )) 

596.65 599.15 B: you know you just have bad situations 

598.93 599.89 A: yeah
