25.00 26.90 B: yeah 

25.52 30.10 A: how nice that's a beau- i tell you that's a beautiful area mill basin 

27.03 27.89 B: (( mm yeah )) 

30.09 31.56 B: yeah 

31.47 33.68 A: it's like a little bit of long island you know 

33.66 34.92 B: yeah 

35.64 37.72 A: do you watch reality t._v. show 

37.73 45.09 B: ah no i don't i never really i'm not a big t._v. watcher actually but no definitely not reality t._v. 

44.94 51.21 A: well i tell you reality um t._v. it's funny they have that name because it really is the furthest thing from reality 

51.10 60.08 A: people are put in situations kind of for example i'm not a ah a fanatic but especially i prefer surfing the internet over t._v. any time 

55.90 56.99 B: right 

60.06 60.89 B: right 

60.47 64.53 A: but i will tell you that the um survivors is basically 

64.57 72.05 A: um i forgot how many people are put on there but i think this assuming it's a small group of people approximately an equal number of men and women 

72.07 75.03 A: and they go they're put on a deserted island 

75.06 77.63 A: and um what happens is hello 

77.67 78.67 B: (( yeah )) 

78.10 79.38 A: oh you're still there okay 

79.00 80.01 B: [laughter] 

79.51 86.18 A: i'm sorry they're put in on a deserted island and what happens is that the ah conditions are very primitive 

86.04 87.00 B: right 

86.28 92.03 A: you know there's snakes and there's lizards and it can be scorching sun or or like torrential downpour 

92.24 98.30 A: and um [cough] then at a certain period of time they have to vote who they want off 

98.36 99.28 B: okay 

99.19 108.81 A: and in the last program it was really really interesting because and remember i most of the time i don't watch t._v. i don't even like soap operas but it tells you about human nature 

106.90 107.74 B: right 

108.78 116.18 A: i had no idea who was going to be voted off and i'll tell you who was voted off nobody famous these are ordinary people but the reason is interesting 

114.27 115.15 B: uh-huh 

116.38 123.18 A: the reason is the one who won who was not who the last one there who was never voted off was the one that got the food supply 

120.77 121.62 B: uh-huh 

123.24 124.59 B: oh 

124.45 131.03 A: now he didn't work for the program he was a regular person but what he did was he went the extra mile he went into the ocean he went fishing 

131.01 131.89 B: uh-huh 

131.41 135.02 A: whereas the other people would just wait for the um 

135.37 142.20 A: would just wait for um the ah the the people that ran the t._v. program did ship them food once a week 

138.11 139.26 B: the ration 

141.98 143.08 B: right 

142.21 145.75 A: but if you didn't like the food or if it ran out 

146.13 147.47 A: then you're stuck 

147.44 148.30 B: (( okay )) 

147.88 157.17 A: so they now the one that won would not only [laughter] not only did he was he responsible for their survival ah more than anyone else but he was gay 

157.30 158.24 B: oh 

157.90 161.81 A: so i don't know what implication that is but the other people are straight and he was gay 

161.62 162.57 B: right 

161.98 165.99 A: it shows that when push comes to shove how everybody's equal 

166.31 167.61 B: right 

167.18 171.58 A: well what do you um do you ever watch any t._v. at all like a documentary 

171.85 180.86 B: um well honestly the only programming that i do watch on t._v. is um children's because i write children's books for a living 

180.93 185.62 A: oh how wonderful i love reading that was always my favorite subject in in school 

180.99 181.88 B: (( so )) 

185.41 186.44 B: (( my )) 

186.26 192.77 A: how wonderful when you when you write children's books um do you also do the artwork or is there an artist 

187.23 188.06 B: [laughter] 

192.49 199.77 B: well i sometimes i outsource illustrators sometimes i'll do it myself a lot of times the publishing company will match 

199.74 214.01 B: so um i mean because i am published i don't have much ah input besides um you know what i write but when i do like my own projects either i'll do it myself or i'll find somebody online bring some sort portfolio work or 

213.38 219.79 A: you know i've i've always [cough] wanted to write and i i just have one question which you probably can answer 'cause you've done it already 

219.45 220.44 B: mhm 

219.80 224.48 A: the fact is when you write your first book no matter what the subject is but you write your first book 

224.59 226.92 A: how do you get it published if you're unknown 

227.01 236.84 B: well [laughter] it's a lot of hard work i ah you know i've been pitching i i have one book published through a major publishing company penguin and i've been um 

237.07 240.78 B: pitching right now to scholastic and i don't 

238.93 243.92 A: oh how wonderful did you have to pay for the publishing because because you were unknown 

242.65 255.55 B: no well that's a vanity publishing press and i don't recommend doing it because you don't get the exposure that you probably deserve ah basically you just need to keep going and i mean my first book that was published 

246.02 246.84 A: yeah 

254.45 258.71 A: how did you how did you get pen- did you need an agent to get penguin interested in you 

258.58 267.92 B: well i fell into like the lap of luck because a boy that i'd gone to school with begin began a job as a publish- as an illustrator for penguin 

267.74 273.86 B: so he he kind of pushed my book through for me you really need to know people i mean do you have to do like 

273.64 286.59 B: networking or stuff like that but it's really hard it really is it's [laughter] it makes me very sad every day when i have to troop out into the city and and sell myself basically but you do what you gotta do to make a living 

285.50 287.91 A: but you've been able to do it without an agent 

288.06 294.23 B: yeah i don't have an agent and i'm i'm twenty one years old and i've been publishing since i was sixteen i've never had an 

293.13 294.41 A: oh my god 

294.39 295.48 B: yeah 

295.98 296.86 B: so 

296.88 298.59 B: [laughter] 

297.55 311.31 A: that's i think that is really commendable you know i'm i'm kind of old fashioned i i i'm i'm insecure without a regular paycheck so i work for civil service but you know how lucky i am i'm not a city worker anymore you must've read in the papers what they're doing to city workers 

298.82 299.38 B: (( [cough] )) 

305.62 306.58 B: right 

311.34 315.11 B: well my father's a city worker so don't say anything bad 

314.81 323.35 A: well i used to work for the police department as an office worker but in nineteen ninety i changed to the courts the courts used to be um city now they're state 

317.74 319.12 B: right 

323.08 324.14 B: mhm 

323.55 328.50 A: so i'm a state worker but if i didn't get out i probably would've been laid off is your dad still working 

324.73 326.48 B: right 

328.30 330.37 B: my dad's a deputy commissioner 

330.11 331.05 A: he's what 

330.84 332.70 B: a deputy commissioner 

332.79 333.56 A: hm 

333.38 337.01 B: of new york ah for welfare fraud investigations 

336.87 340.93 A: well i bet he should be the very last one to go because they desperately need him 

341.00 342.08 B: right 

341.79 345.65 A: you know what i do i um i'm a court assistant in brooklyn criminal court 

345.52 349.57 B: oh really maybe you can get me out of jury duty [laughter] 

348.27 354.53 A: actually you wanna know the truth that's a special division and that and you really have to know someone to work in that division it's supposed to be 

353.44 354.86 B: yeah 

354.61 360.70 A: um the elite [noise] [lipsmack] ah what i do is i do the um i have you ever been on jury duty 

360.57 368.98 B: i just got ah i have i had to postpone i got summoned for the grand jury so i have to serve but i have i'm gonna do it in the summer 

368.69 375.37 A: well i think you know you'll get treated very well 'cause i was on jury duty myself before i worked for the courts just an ordinary person 

375.22 376.46 B: mhm 

375.58 380.88 A: many times i can't promise you but ninety nine percent of the times you get an extended lunch and you get paid for that 

380.63 381.58 B: right 

380.98 394.01 A: um and you then they finally let you go home early [sigh] um i think if you don't get chosen i believe if they still do it this way 'cause i'm talking about over thirteen years ago i believe that they don't keep you more than three to five days 

393.86 405.69 B: well [mn] the grand jury is it's mandatory for everybody to serve for two weeks straight and if you don't get picked the first time you're called in then you have to keep going back until you serve so 

404.54 410.63 A: see i don't have experience with grand juries so you're telling me something i didn't know i was just going by by criminal court 

408.10 409.04 B: right 

410.26 419.21 B: right no it's it's completely different i i thought that would just have no problem with it telling them i'm a student but apparently there's no getting out of this so 

412.64 413.57 A: yeah 

418.35 427.02 A: oh no they like students 'cause i met student on the ah when when i ah was on jury they as far as i don't know about getting picked for a ju- for actual 

427.06 432.46 A: ah the actual trials but i can tell you they they have no problem with serving people who were students 

432.16 433.44 B: yeah i know 

432.82 442.23 A: [laughter] and and i tell you the the defense likes it because they think see they make the problem is they stereotype and the stereotype students in one lump as liberal 

441.97 444.12 B: right as liberal yeah 

443.28 445.24 A: i don't think it's necessarily true 

445.07 460.01 B: well i mean if you're talking about the nineteen sixties then maybe that would be true but i don't [laughter] i don't think so now i mean i consider myself extremely leftist but i have plenty of people in my classes that are conservative more than i could ever say my grandparents are so 

448.45 449.84 A: [laughter] 

456.86 457.89 A: (( good hm )) 

460.43 461.56 B: yeah 

461.70 464.28 B: i think the times have changed [laughter] 

464.03 476.06 A: yeah i think you're right also in fact i i was very surprised when i saw a newspaper article two weeks ago that it wasn't it was not in this state i forgot which state it was but it was in america that a particular college campus was 

476.09 478.02 A: in support of the troops 

478.67 479.59 B: really 

478.77 487.16 A: and i nearly had a heart attack 'cause i'm in support of the troops too and i said my god you know usually college students always feel the opposite of how the government feels usually 

486.63 491.58 B: [noise] well i can tell you something very amusing that um on my college campus we had 

491.39 503.37 B: um an apathy protest which sounds absolutely ridiculous but basically they were marching around screaming like what do we want anything when do we want it anytime 

500.20 502.16 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

503.25 510.34 B: because i mean i i can speak you know i'm i'm gonna be a graduating senior and really don't think that there is many 

510.37 518.08 B: sent- i mean i go to a local school but i don't really think that kids my age are getting riled up about politics anymore 

517.95 527.51 B: and and i say that and i keep my eye you know open i near as constantly tuned into what's going on but i don't that it's such an issue anymore to people my age 

526.90 540.09 A: i think you're right in fact i'm fifty one years old and i agree with you because i'm not just saying it to agree but ah let's face it in the daily life of a typical american if there is such a thing politics doesn't really affect us like they do in third world countries 

539.88 550.25 B: no because you can you can do whatever you want to you can do your daily thing and nothing's really gonna affect you unless there's bombs flying over your head which isn't really gonna happen in america 

542.58 543.94 A: (( but exactly )) 

549.31 556.22 A: [laughter] you know but um come to think about it what your um i'm glad that your father has a very secure job 

556.23 567.63 A: really and ah with the courts they they can very they have in the past laid off in the early nineties they have laid off state court workers but it was a kind of a thing where they were laid off for two or three months 

564.67 565.54 B: right 

567.42 572.32 A: however even though they weren't getting paid their health insurance continued which is very important 

570.86 572.88 B: well that's good yeah 

572.42 575.84 A: (( so in a way that's like a salary i mean if you have to go to a doctor [laughter] you know )) 

575.82 576.92 B: right 

576.17 579.26 A: but they were they were taken back after three months 

578.28 579.01 B: i 

579.22 587.09 B: i lost my job after september eleventh and i haven't had good luck with a job ever since like right now i'm collecting unemployment because 

586.48 589.74 A: that's not an author is it writing books you're talking 

590.14 599.89 B: no no writing that's not my pr- i mean i would love for that be my profession but i i was doing clerical work you know i'm a college student i need to pay bills 

596.23 597.78 A: about oh oh 

598.74 599.95 A: was it in the world trade
