0.20 2.23 B: hi my name's tiffany 

2.76 5.16 A: hi tiffany my name is evelyn 

5.15 6.33 B: hi evelyn 

6.61 7.86 B: well um 

8.00 12.95 B: i guess uh this is about iraq and our problems with iraq um 

13.38 27.26 B: i feel that we need to um go over to iraq and um no only um take all their chemical and nuclear weapons i feel we should disarm the entire place i think every civilian 

27.49 29.56 B: should be armless 

30.08 33.63 A: [noise] i agree totally um i feel that 

34.20 45.10 A: there's a lot that needs to be done in the united states and we're over there and spending a lot of our our money that we can be using right here in the united states and helping a lot of people um 

45.70 58.47 A: as far as uh disarming i agree totally because if there are no guns um and there is no chemicals over there then it's a lot less that we have to worry about and hopefully there won't be another war 

59.14 65.31 B: do you feel um that these have to uh wars have helped anything 

65.64 68.88 A: do i feel the war has helped anything um 

69.96 72.29 A: for the iraqi people yes 

72.33 80.25 A: i do completely um the leader that they had over there was absolutely uh one of the most destructive people 

80.47 82.93 A: um mind and body that i've ever 

83.51 84.83 A: ever heard of 

84.92 85.98 A: (( [mn] um )) 

85.00 95.58 B: but you don't feel that we should have let them um deal with it themselves if they had such a problem i mean now they hate us because we went in there and took him away now they've got two people to hate 

93.06 93.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

94.04 94.86 A: um 

95.54 108.27 A: well i don't feel that they hate all of us uh i don't feel all of the people hate us just a select few of 'em in the leadership um because the people themselves the citizens they just admire the united states 

108.34 111.91 A: in fact they want to join the army of the united states 

111.77 112.68 B: huh 

112.71 113.73 A: um 

115.06 123.06 A: uh i i agree that um as far as them taking care of themselves no they they'd never be able to take care of themselves 

122.82 130.26 B: so do you feel the u._n. should step in and propose and and create some type of government for iraq 

130.55 135.33 A: i believe uh that should be done because i don't think that they can do it themselves no 

134.40 140.24 B: instead of letting them elect their own people and getting in the same boat and getting someone worse than saddam hussein 

137.99 138.95 A: um 

139.95 142.43 A: i think that they'll probably elect their own 

143.05 149.82 A: um let's just hope that it's not anywhere near the the type of people that they had put into uh 

150.89 152.69 A: leadership beforehand 

152.55 153.83 B: yeah 

153.69 159.93 A: and a lot of them were related you know i mean he had his he had two sons in there 

159.76 161.23 B: yeah that's true 

161.10 166.42 A: and uh they definitely were not any better than he was in fact they they 

167.24 168.89 A: really um 

169.75 171.86 A: like they were hungry for torture 

171.94 174.87 B: do you think that we should continue um 

172.00 173.01 A: i mean 

175.81 183.11 B: you know bombing iraq and and and trying to find uh saddam hussein and and not stop until we do 

182.92 185.15 A: i i think he's fled 

185.29 190.62 A: i just my opinion i think he's fled i don't think he's there any more so 

188.02 198.47 B: [mn] so okay we we osama and saddam are just running around and we've created two wars killed off hundreds of thousands of people destroyed no telling what and 

198.74 200.67 B: we didn't get the people out of power 

201.16 203.94 B: they can go and start up whenever they feel like it 

204.98 206.19 B: somewhere else 

205.47 208.91 A: um i don't think that they would because i don't think the people would let 'em 

208.85 209.73 B: (( huh )) 

209.49 219.99 A: um but i i do feel that he's fled because if not then i think we would know b- you know by now if he was where he where he was killed definitely 

219.82 221.17 B: absolutely 

220.97 223.13 A: and uh the leadership as well 

223.04 229.51 B: so what do you think that um we should do um as far as w- we're standing right now with our position 

231.04 233.06 A: uh just rebuild the government 

233.22 244.02 B: so continue on what they're doing with their rebuilding tactics and um continue searching for um these weapons that don't exist 

243.98 244.96 A: yeah 

244.63 246.27 B: [laughter] 

245.00 259.67 A: there's a lot [mn] there's a lot underground there's a lot in houses i- in i mean in the walls of uh houses that have been deserted they've found oh god what did they find inside the house wasn't it like five hundred thousand dollars 

259.77 261.34 A: i mean five hundred 

261.44 265.13 A: six hundred and some odd million dollars in the wall of a house there 

265.25 268.12 A: uh the leader used so 

267.05 268.28 B: wow 

268.22 269.44 A: (( yeah )) 

269.45 270.77 A: all in cash 

270.61 277.10 B: that's amazing so um do you think that we should continue with our military ef- efforts 

271.72 273.48 A: yeah it really is 

277.61 280.39 B: and um continue um 

280.45 283.56 B: fighting um the rebels and um 

283.66 288.05 B: continue what we're doing as far as um trying to restore peace 

287.84 290.03 A: i think that's exhausted now 

291.07 292.78 B: so you think we're beyond that 

291.29 294.52 A: no i think i think yeah i believe so 

294.69 302.90 A: i believe it's peace now i i mean they're gonna you know find some here and there you know that are still going to side with uh 

294.80 295.62 B: huh 

303.22 305.98 A: uh uh saddam hussein but 

306.13 309.51 A: other than that no i think it's just about exhausted 

309.82 311.08 A: the whole war 

311.11 312.01 B: huh 

312.58 313.53 A: um 

313.00 314.67 B: are you happy with the outcome 

316.84 320.91 A: yes and no i mean it cost a lot of money for the united states [mn] 

319.53 324.58 B: see i'm not happy at all with it i feel we've wasted our time we've wasted our money we've killed people um 

324.92 329.77 B: and i feel that they've tried to brainwash us into believing that we're doing something right 

329.99 331.10 A: really 

330.69 331.69 B: uh-huh 

331.50 332.69 A: yeah 

332.87 336.85 A: and what do you think about all the women and the way they were tortured over there 

336.26 343.67 B: i think that they're going to get somebody else in power over there that's going to do the same thing because they've been letting it happen all these years they're not going to stop 

344.31 352.81 B: you know i mean i mean looking at kuwait i mean the women could uncover their faces and they chose to cover them up because they'd been covered for so long 

353.00 354.04 A: yes 

353.86 363.51 B: you know um you know as soon as saddam got out of power they bashed their heads with rocks and you know walked around covered in blood saddam hussein wouldn't allow that i wonder why 

364.23 368.28 B: you know it's like those people over there are crazy they're like savages 

367.65 369.63 A: they bashed whose heads in rocks 

368.80 372.96 B: they bashed their own heads with rocks and walked around covered in blood you know 

372.23 375.07 A: oh my god i yeah i didn't know that 

373.47 377.99 B: i mean there was little ten year old boys covered in blood with big gashes in their heads 

377.37 378.50 A: man 

378.42 381.77 B: and you know they're like oh saddam wouldn't allow this it's like i wonder why 

381.98 386.62 A: i know they had rape rooms and and all kinds of things going on over there 

386.27 394.71 B: yeah and you know but the thing is that they've allowed it for so long us stepping in or whatever is not going to make it end i don't believe 

394.59 396.71 A: no well maybe you're right 

395.12 402.81 B: i believe that the that the next person that comes in is going to be like yeah well i mean that's like a normal every day thing getting raped and killed 

403.63 406.23 B: you know over there it's like part of life 

406.07 411.91 A: i know that if a woman is raped or was raped over there then the brother 

411.99 414.35 A: uh was the one that had to kill her 

414.80 417.00 A: so that she wouldn't shame the family 

415.00 415.67 B: (( god )) 

416.67 417.95 B: (( god )) 

417.23 420.77 A: because they always blamed it on the the woman being raped 

420.64 421.38 B: uh 

420.86 427.40 A: and they also when they're i believe when they're babies uh the women are babies they cut the clitorises 

427.58 428.38 B: (( ugh )) 

427.76 430.52 A: so that they won't grow up enjoying 

430.71 432.61 A: uh pleasure from sex 

432.70 433.55 B: uh 

432.88 435.86 A: so that so that they you know won't um 

436.49 437.14 A: (( uh )) 

437.28 439.72 A: go find love elsewhere other than your 

439.76 440.85 A: (( uh partner )) 

439.79 443.84 B: so are we um are they still practicing that now that uh 

443.23 448.50 A: um i hope not i hope not i hope that that's you know that stopped that 

443.87 445.25 B: saddam's out of power 

448.65 449.81 A: i'm hoping [mn] 

449.77 453.04 B: so do you think then that basically um that 

453.05 466.92 B: we should continue with our efforts now trying just to rebuild iraq and not concentrate so heavily then on the arms issue do you feel that we pretty much have found everything and they really didn't have as much as we thought they did 

461.64 462.70 A: that's right 

466.79 469.74 A: that's what i hope that's what i think yes 

469.76 474.77 B: you don't think saddam's hiding out somewhere with his thirty two bombs 

472.71 473.54 A: um 

474.14 475.30 A: i i 

474.82 476.53 B: ready to aim 'em at us 

476.01 480.98 A: i don't know i really don't know i don't know if he's fled the country or if he's still if he's 

481.07 484.68 A: you know hiding underground somewhere and um 

484.11 486.89 B: i think when we least expect it we're in trouble [mn] 

484.83 486.02 A: with all the weapons 

487.21 490.66 A: really and then you think they're going to come out from hiding and mm 

490.27 504.67 B: yeah he's probably got a secret little army hidden somewhere you know wherever he's at they're just protecting him that's what they need to concentrate on finding i think i think they shouldn't stop until they find saddam hussein because once he's dead and gone and they see his body 

504.53 508.76 B: then they will finally feel that something has been accomplished 

508.19 517.90 A: well see that's the thing i think they should find the body i mean as you say you know they haven't found it and they should keep going however i mean they're pretty sure that they got him 

517.73 518.69 B: (( yeah but )) 

518.61 519.70 A: (( um )) 

519.03 520.73 B: there'd be some remains 

521.24 524.38 A: there should be something for d._n._a. testing 

524.12 533.04 B: i mean look at osama we did all that with afghanistan and osama is still running around we don't even you never even hear about him any more what if that's going to happen with saddam hussein too 

529.84 530.81 A: (( i know )) 

533.70 534.93 A: (( i know )) 

533.76 537.52 B: you know we're just going to forget about him and destroy our country and 

536.89 541.63 A: there should be something found somewhere from that building that they bombed 

541.70 549.88 A: and they're pretty sure they got uh him and um his sons and um you know they should find something from one of 'em 

549.81 557.60 B: i mean there's no proof that we even basically went over there to go get somebody and we never even got that person and and we destroyed everything and now what 

558.43 559.54 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

558.74 559.79 B: [laughter] 

560.19 561.34 A: yeah 

560.72 562.58 B: they were not the objective 

562.38 568.11 A: not to mention how much you know it cost cost the united states uh billions 

564.74 566.03 B: oh yeah 

567.11 572.48 B: [noise] and they're deploying more troops over all the time i mean it's costing us money still every day 

573.30 576.71 A: mhm and where i live here i live in tampa florida 

576.42 577.45 B: (( oh wow ))

583.96 585.54 B: what are the yellow ribbons for 

585.78 589.58 A: uh for the family members you know the husbands the sons 

588.66 590.65 B: oh god really 

590.11 599.95 A: oh y- oh yes one of um one of the high schools down here in fact they had a big funeral service for 'em all the students because it was uh one of the honor students
