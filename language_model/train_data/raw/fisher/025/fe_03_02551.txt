92.96 93.93 A: wow 

94.35 102.21 B: so um but the other reality shows but see i'm i'm not man enough for like the amazon or

101.65 102.51 A: (( [laughter] )) 

103.00 110.06 B: or all of that i i um i'm just not you know a a tough enough person to do that 

109.69 124.47 A: yeah yeah and i enjoy it not so much for the personalities or the clashes of personalities but i'd really like the scenery and and i like the the physical aspect of that seeing how people cope in that kind of an environment 

122.84 124.48 B: that's interest- 

124.34 128.51 A: that's that's why i like it that's why i didn't like big brother because it was too much 

124.55 125.94 B: that's interes- 

128.52 132.23 A: of just the personalities and that didn't interest me 

130.81 137.29 B: well and see that's interesting because wh- when i have watched um amazon 

137.35 145.02 B: that that's one of the reasons i watched it was for the scenery and that the wide open spaces because now 

141.81 143.14 A: (( mhm yeah mhm yeah you )) 

143.83 146.00 A: mean survivor yeah 

145.45 149.82 B: yeah because now that now that i'm getting older 

149.58 150.68 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

150.02 154.12 B: if i were going to do one it would not be big brother 

154.31 160.56 B: um it would be one of the amazon type things because i would love to see 

160.61 163.64 B: the the different environments 

163.21 165.49 A: oh so you gonna apply you think 

165.08 170.40 B: oh no no they wouldn't accept me i have a d._u._i. so they would never accept me 

170.28 171.33 A: [laughter] you think so 

171.44 174.09 A: (( ooh i don't know people have had worse than that banana )) 

171.46 173.17 B: [mn] but no 

173.98 183.16 B: well i know but but see 'cause they they've gotten beat up so much because you know the first few rounds of every reality show 

175.20 176.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

178.87 179.64 A: yeah 

182.79 184.26 A: mhm 

183.94 189.56 B: they had like a slasher and a rapist and a d._u._i. and all that 

187.32 188.22 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

188.91 190.04 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

189.82 194.48 B: you know i couldn't even begin to apply for one of those shows 'cause 

194.57 200.05 B: you know i would be up front with them but i figure being up front with them they wouldn't accept me 

199.76 201.58 A: probably not yeah yeah mhm 

201.27 202.22 B: (( you know )) 

202.41 210.76 B: so but then they get these people that slip through [laughter] [laughter] that that bring 'em up in the headlines 

210.85 218.97 A: yeah well i thought about applying but i don't i i doubt that i will however if i ever did what gets me i think the first thing i would do 

211.09 212.14 B: so 

219.04 233.30 A: is learn how to fish i can't believe all these people go out there and they don't have the a clue on how to fish and you know and and most of the s- ah the areas that they're in that's the way they're gonna survive as far as getting food 

232.48 241.18 B: well but remember when you do apply okay remember when you do apply that some of the older people like us 

241.47 248.10 B: who have who have applied um that's what the younger people have against them 

249.05 250.14 B: so 

250.72 251.60 A: (( [mn] [mn] yeah [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

251.49 256.75 B: if you know how to do that that's great but don't don't shine off to them 

256.46 262.24 A: no no but i mean before i went there i think i would try to learn some survival skills 

262.06 264.37 B: well i would hope that everybody 

262.69 264.69 A: these people seem to have none they 

264.75 267.95 B: anybody that applied should have those skills 

265.62 266.67 A: don't prepare 

267.27 275.11 A: yeah but you see people couldn't make a fire they can't fish they can't build shelter it like god what are they thinking you know 

274.42 279.31 B: well they're in midtown manhattan so what are they gonna do [laughter] 

277.05 278.34 A: yeah right 

280.66 286.68 A: yeah so um that that's the only one though that you you liked was big brother yeah 

286.44 291.73 B: no it's the only one i liked it's the only one i related to at the time 

288.62 289.36 A: oh 

291.23 292.66 A: i see 

292.18 298.89 B: you know and now i'm thoroughly well not thoroughly you know you always 

298.91 301.50 B: feel responsible for your kids 

301.21 302.58 A: mhm 

302.18 309.86 B: so um they're getting at that point in their college education that i can start thinking about myself 

309.98 310.84 B: (( you know )) 

311.03 315.98 B: because they're getting good scholarships and they're getting internships 

314.86 316.53 A: are they all in college now 

316.69 321.51 B: and yeah the final one started in january so [laughter] 

317.52 318.26 A: (( wow )) 

321.88 326.85 A: [laughter] yeah i've got one at u._c._l._a. and another one going there next ah fall so 

326.67 328.67 B: really i have two at uc-

329.05 331.20 B: i have two at u._c._i. 

330.71 332.41 A: (( yeah oh yeah yeah )) 

331.74 332.62 B: so

340.74 351.60 B: [laughter] so you know then once that's taken care of then i figure then you know they feel they have ah responsibility in their education 

351.63 352.44 B: you 

353.38 355.93 B: know so that'll help me a lot 

355.56 359.88 A: (( [mn] yeah mhm yeah oh and you have more time to watch reality shows right ))

370.88 384.92 A: yeah but i'm amazed so many people watch the again going back to the dating ones and stuff because to me that is so fabricated and you know the girls the guys they don't have any intent to do anything long term it's just to be 

384.99 396.03 A: glorified or to make a name for themselves or just to be put themselves in the public's eye or something you know but i just can't believe people get so wrapped up in that stuff 

395.62 398.72 B: [noise] [noise] you're talking like the joe millionaire thing 

398.66 399.65 A: the which one 

399.71 402.41 B: that joe millionaire or whatever it is 

401.33 404.48 A: yeah that one or the bachelor or the series

413.40 417.47 B: (( that's getting a little um come on [laughter] )) 

416.39 420.15 A: [laughter] yeah again it's just all 

420.51 423.11 A: (( put on for the camera you know it's just ah yeah )) 

422.44 424.99 B: well it has to be i would think 

424.63 429.01 A: right soon as the the cameras rolling you know they're gonna act a certain way and 

428.72 430.33 B: exactly 

429.50 437.04 A: yeah mhm people wanna put themselves on display like that oh okay i guess but i'm not gonna watch it doesn't interest me

438.43 439.17 A: no 

439.80 441.00 A: (( no yeah )) 

441.08 447.61 B: so but i think that's great for them if that's what they wanna do go ahead on but 

446.21 451.46 A: i did that actually i did that once but my wife will probably say you know you'll never do it again 

451.25 453.45 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] ))

467.64 470.10 B: no oh god did that suck 

470.71 484.52 A: yeah well they the way they edit things you know it kind of makes you look bad and they said it was gonna be a soft piece and they were just gonna show a family in las vegas and then then they interviewed me and they started asking me all these really hard questions about why you're bringing you children here 

474.29 475.74 B: yeah that's true 

483.35 485.23 B: (( oh no ))

522.19 533.37 A: and it's interesting to watch you know how they do it and how they follow you around and how they have the you know a whole crew with the camera and the mike and the ah reporter and her producer all following you and you know it's 

534.31 536.65 A: it's ah a set up in a way

566.01 567.40 A: (( seems like an expensive [mn] )) 

566.29 572.33 B: from what i understand they're they're to create some new dolls that'll have

579.09 580.31 B: dialect 

580.56 585.66 A: you're kidding me that's what this is about 'cause it's a university that's why i don't understand
