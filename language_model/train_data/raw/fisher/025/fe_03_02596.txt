3.09 4.93 B: hi my name is jill 

5.08 7.02 A: hi jill i'm sarah 

6.60 7.44 B: hi 

7.67 8.25 B: (( [cough] )) 

7.75 22.66 A: how you doing [laughter] yeah neither have i it sounds i don't know interesting but yeah okay so i didn't entirely hear the question did it we're supposed to just talk about arms in iraq disarming 

8.40 11.08 B: good how are you i've never done this before [laughter] 

14.01 15.42 B: yeah [laughter] 

21.35 29.56 B: it said i believe the question said what do you think if anything should the u._s. do about disarming iraq 

28.27 28.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

29.38 32.05 A: [noise] disarming iraq right okay 

32.31 35.01 A: (( all righty do you wanna start or [laughter] )) 

34.69 36.34 B: (( mhm well )) 

36.85 38.58 B: go ahead [laughter] 

38.24 48.11 A: okay um well i don't think we should've been there in the first place um i don't think they were any or near as much of a threat as places like north korea are 

48.12 54.55 A: um [lipsmack] and we probably should have tried to disarm them first before we even went somewhere where we can't even really find anything 

54.42 55.40 B: mhm 

54.80 55.87 A: um 

56.02 62.74 A: [lipsmack] but that's me i know it's a bit inflammatory [laughter] i don't know what do you think 

62.13 65.43 B: well i you know i mean i don't think that 

65.66 71.38 B: war is ever a good thing i mean it sometimes it's necessary but it's never 

67.93 68.94 A: right 

71.40 72.91 B: good 

72.51 73.42 A: right 

73.15 74.94 B: but um 

75.59 79.75 B: i do think that saddam was a very bad person 

79.80 82.50 A: i agree i i absolutely agree 

80.91 81.97 B: but 

82.35 85.11 B: i also think that 

85.48 94.66 B: i you know north korea probably is also a a big threat to the united states because they probably do have nuclear weapons 

90.03 91.94 A: [noise] i mean yes 

94.06 100.90 A: yeah well we know they do i mean they've they've started [laughter] they've started a reactor [laughter] yeah 

95.63 96.53 B: [cough] 

96.96 100.47 B: well they've started the process but you know 

100.57 104.43 B: whether we ever will be able to find out that they actually 

104.47 106.31 B: have assembled 

106.41 112.78 B: weapons you know is another thing [sigh] you know i don't i think all in all 

106.51 107.50 A: right 

112.85 114.42 B: the um 

115.68 116.86 B: i don't know 

117.68 124.55 A: yeah i mean i just i i don't even know if there are any in iraq honestly [laughter] i'm really starting to doubt it 

123.89 132.04 B: well you know they found some some questionable stuff but they've yet they have not they 

124.62 125.50 A: but 

128.70 129.61 A: yeah 

131.16 132.16 A: wasn't it 

132.33 133.86 B: they've yet to find 

132.43 133.84 A: like pesticides 

133.96 135.25 B: i'm sorry 

134.49 138.43 A: (( i don't know [laughter] it was like pesticides or something like that i don't know )) 

136.87 144.70 B: well i think it was like mustard gas agents that you know and that that is bad stuff i mean 

140.99 142.79 A: yeah 

144.77 146.37 A: right 

145.45 147.12 B: but you know and 

147.19 157.75 B: some have compared saddam to hitler which you know i- in ess- in essence he he was you know a dictator and 

150.83 152.07 A: right 

152.38 153.18 A: (( huh )) 

156.08 156.67 A: (( [noise] )) 

157.82 161.83 B: like i said it's it's probably a good thing that he's no longer in power 

161.78 163.01 A: yeah 

162.30 164.39 B: but whether 

165.54 167.95 B: they were really the biggest threat 

168.05 171.68 B: for for the united states to be addressing at the time 

171.69 174.18 B: i think remains to be seen 

171.86 176.86 A: yeah definitely and i yeah but i 

176.94 188.24 A: i just i think there's a lot of propaganda involved too as there is with any any kind of military action i don't know i don't i don't feel like we're getting the full story i think it's definitely been very obscured 

181.58 182.47 B: right 

188.00 193.89 B: there well yeah there's and you know maybe there are reasons that we don't get the full story i don't know 

188.45 189.31 A: (( um )) 

193.47 204.46 A: right 'cause i mean like looking at other international news sources they they provide a much different type of coverage like say british news for instance is 

201.49 202.66 B: right 

203.66 216.75 B: right and i have read i have read some reports from british news [sigh] online before so i you know i'm f- a little familiar with you know the other side of things the way that [sigh] 

204.55 205.98 A: far more critical 

209.73 210.86 A: right 

218.03 220.21 B: that other countries are 

220.60 221.66 B: [sigh] you know 

221.59 235.93 B: responding and what they're saying about it and everything but [sigh] i don't know i guess all in all what it boils down to is that he was given a deadline and he didn't you know 

222.79 224.22 A: mhm 

236.19 238.67 B: i guess at that point 

236.40 237.43 A: yeah 

239.16 241.16 B: for us to back down 

241.20 242.59 B: it would have been 

243.58 245.65 B: i don't know you know kind of 

243.60 244.61 A: right 

244.78 246.06 A: i just 

246.34 249.36 A: i don't i i didn't i didn't see that he 

249.42 250.43 A: (( wasn't )) 

250.53 259.44 A: i mean i i understand that there's a fine line between full cooperation and not [laughter] you know not cooperating but seeming to comply 

256.50 258.77 B: right right 

259.48 266.16 A: i i don't know i don't think that was investigated far enough and i really think we messed up by not going with world opinion 

266.15 278.94 A: uh that we needed more time to really look and see if he was indeed lying because the ultimatum we gave him was just to leave and that's that's a tough ultimatum i mean who's gonna really do that it was kind of a declaration of war 

272.72 273.88 B: right 

278.75 291.45 B: right and you know i mean from what from all reports it looks like that's what happened anyway i mean no- nobody has ever confirmed whether he was actually alive or dead just that he is out of power so 

279.96 280.70 A: so 

285.09 286.93 A: (( [noise] right )) 

289.69 290.70 A: right 

291.75 293.22 B: you know it's 

292.76 294.12 A: exactly 

293.52 296.77 B: it's kinda where are you calling from by the way 

296.89 299.54 A: [noise] pardon me [noise] 

300.92 301.89 A: hello 

301.40 303.78 B: yes i was just asking where you're from 

303.73 307.00 A: oh i'm i'm actually i'm from california but i live in new york city 

306.56 308.37 B: oh are do you really 

308.20 309.97 A: yeah [laughter] 

308.70 311.68 B: well i'm from texas i'm from texas so [laughter] 

311.06 319.29 A: right interesting yeah i i thought so i was i was sensing the the drawl [laughter] yeah but you know it's interesting 

316.07 317.17 B: yes 

317.87 319.18 B: and you know 

319.73 333.21 B: geo- george bush was our governor before he was our president and as a as our governor he did a good job but you know and i know that his approval rating has dropped some in the past few months but 

320.10 321.00 A: (( int- )) 

326.37 327.37 A: right 

333.43 334.60 B: i don't know 

334.67 336.52 A: (( [noise] yeah i'm )) 

335.03 336.58 B: all in all 

336.68 337.65 B: you know 

336.70 337.66 A: just 

337.74 344.19 A: definitely not a fan myself [laughter] no yeah but you probably picked up on that you know i 

339.53 340.94 B: are you not 

342.98 345.42 B: well yeah but you you know 

344.43 345.30 A: think 

345.51 348.61 B: i'm partial because i'm from texas you know 

345.61 346.71 A: (( it's )) 

348.27 351.92 A: right yeah and that's you know that's understandable but i 

348.89 349.89 B: and 

350.56 351.61 B: it just 

352.06 356.24 A: [sigh] i have i have big problems with him 

355.51 357.77 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

356.25 357.66 A: i really do 

357.56 359.83 A: just yeah i've yeah i'm 

359.68 367.66 A: i'm kind of it it's really kind of making me feel kind of unpatriotic even that that he's in in power and [sigh] 

366.64 367.74 B: oh really 

367.47 380.36 A: uh yeah yeah it's it's been it's it's frustrating to me 'cause i i feel like he hasn't listened to people as much as he should have and he took actions that were very detrimental to our 

380.24 391.15 A: our place in the world i mean i i i think other other countries aren't gonna wanna be friends with us any more as infantile as that sounds but he's you know he's really really 

391.57 402.05 A: killed some of our relationships with other countries which is really unfortunate because that's the way we need to go and we're not the only people on the planet [laughter] you know there's 

395.53 396.58 B: yeah 

400.50 410.51 B: and i really hope that that's not the case i mean when when it all boils down because you know when other countries are in trouble we always go to their aid 

403.67 404.68 A: yeah 

410.63 411.68 B: you know 

410.91 418.05 A: well sometimes though not just not always [laughter] yeah right 

413.23 418.63 B: well i don't i just mean throughout history not particularly you know 

418.89 419.69 B: in 

419.77 427.88 B: any partic- just you know throughout history we have always been some a country that other countries have turned to [sigh] for support 

428.03 439.66 B: during times of trouble and i just you know i hope that after everything is over other countries can look past everything that's happened you know and 

428.54 429.60 A: right 

429.93 430.80 A: yeah 

438.43 442.99 A: i fully agree i really really do [laughter] yeah 

440.02 447.78 B: and and view you know and and you know put everything in perspective i guess [cough] 

446.68 449.37 A: [noise] yeah i i hope 

449.39 453.31 A: i hope this doesn't hurt us as much as it as it could stand to 

453.41 457.68 A: and oh and and aside from that i i think it's pretty appalling 

457.69 469.47 A: the state of our country [laughter] and that we're going off and spending billions of dollars 'cause i'm a teacher and it's it's it's awful i mean all the first year teachers in california have been laid off because of budget problems and 

469.47 472.79 A: the the state of schools next year is gonna be just 

473.07 483.33 A: [noise] awful awful really bad and you know we're spending money in iraq and not in schools [laughter] that's just really hard for me to deal with 

479.54 482.10 B: right and see i don't 

482.21 489.59 B: texas has not been hit with any of that so i'm not but i know oklahoma has and my sister is a teacher in oklahoma 

484.61 486.46 A: right yeah 

489.38 490.51 A: right 

489.57 502.97 B: and they have suffered some budget cuts and are having to look at starting school later in the year because it's so hot here it'll save so much money on air conditioning you know and 

498.01 498.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

502.77 505.24 B: things of that losing their 

503.28 504.74 A: right 

505.27 513.05 B: well i know oklahoma fired all of their janitors and the teachers are now gonna be responsible for keeping their own rooms clean 

508.70 509.89 A: yeah 

512.89 514.14 A: wow 

514.08 518.10 B: so you know i am familiar a little bit texas has not so much 

518.26 519.80 B: had anything 

519.49 521.14 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

520.19 522.40 B: along those lines to happen 

522.41 531.68 A: no yeah it's it's california is just being devastated right now with with the cuts it's really incredible and uh actually same thing in new york city 

531.42 532.35 B: (( right )) 

531.52 546.19 A: new york city is the budget here is just it's incredible so many people are being laid off all the time in in public service and it just really saddens me to see all these people who are trying to do things to improve our quality of life and 

546.43 547.56 A: you know they're 

547.47 562.03 A: they're being laid off [laughter] and that's that's sad um because that's that's not that's not that's not the point of this country the point of this country is to you know to kind of everybody gets to do their thing everyone can find employment 

551.04 552.29 B: yeah 

561.69 563.06 B: right 

562.10 573.20 A: the government helps us out instead of hurts us and we divert our attentions inward rather than you know going out and dealing with problems that really aren't ours to deal with 

566.80 568.07 B: mhm 

573.83 574.93 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

574.90 586.67 A: err well they are they are in the sense that we are the most powerful country in the world and we should be we should be looking looking at what's going on certainly and being part of the diplomatic process but not necessarily 

578.98 580.33 B: right 

586.63 593.47 A: not not going to war like that when the rest of the world isn't with us when we have when we have such problems at home 

594.04 594.95 B: right 

595.41 599.89 B: and you know i think i don't know somehow in my opinion 

595.83 596.79 A: (( so ))
