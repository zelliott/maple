118.49 120.38 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

119.18 127.00 A: so i just i i really couldn't um [noise] i don't know i know some people really like it now i even tried to watch the bachelor 

127.38 128.76 B: (( yes mhm )) 

127.72 132.47 A: but i thought that was wrong how he was doing those women 'cause he was hugging and kissing on all of 'em 

132.91 141.02 A: [noise] and you know dating all those women and making 'em think that they could be the one and you know he'd eliminate them i i just didn't like that [noise] [noise] [noise] 

141.28 151.44 B: yeah um no i mean other than than those two i really didn't watch anything else because they're i guess they're not that interesting as people seem to think 

150.86 152.45 A: (( [noise] mhm ))

157.45 166.97 A: [noise] i don't think they really real i don't know why they call it reality t._v. because they're not really realistic about it they keep hiding see 'cause even joe millionaire

170.06 171.17 B: well i 

178.41 183.47 B: i think that the one that really was more of a reality show to me 

183.24 184.53 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

183.50 185.42 B: was the big brother one 

185.28 186.30 A: okay

192.44 195.18 B: um but do are there any other ones 

195.27 199.02 A: [noise] i gu- i i um [noise] i know well 

199.13 201.66 A: they consider like those dating ones 

201.68 209.43 A: they have the bachelor now they got the bachelorette they have mr personality i think those are considered reality shows but you know

223.28 224.27 B: uh-huh 

227.33 231.43 B: ah what's the name of it it's meet my parents i think 

231.18 232.36 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

232.68 237.08 A: [noise] but you know they had also had a show on [noise] where um 

237.01 249.27 A: [noise] they had it's called like the family or something and they all stay in this mansion or whatever [noise] and it could be like cousins brothers or sisters and parents or whatever and one of them is um 

250.95 253.13 A: [noise] oh gosh one of them is like [noise] 

253.78 263.93 A: really against each other everybody or whatever they they're supposed to win like about i think it's like fifty thousand a hundred thousand dollars or something at the end of it if they if they're like the last one 

263.69 265.02 B: (( mm yeah )) 

264.82 267.12 A: [noise] did you ever see that one no 

267.13 277.01 B: no no i don't watch any like i said you know i don't know why i honestly don't know why people think that they're popular i mean why they became so popular because 

274.18 275.34 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

275.85 278.78 A: maybe the people have a boring life and that's what they 

278.79 282.72 A: [noise] [laughter] that they have nothing else to [laughter] 

279.56 280.91 B: i think so 

281.81 294.86 B: i think i'd take a taped reg- i mean a regular show other than survivor you know i stick i still stick to my friends and my e._r. and all of those i think they're very very nice [mn] 

287.42 289.84 A: [laughter] 

290.89 291.87 A: uh-huh 

294.09 298.91 A: yeah i like i like e._r. friends is funny but i i don't um 

297.59 298.42 B: mhm 

299.01 310.59 A: i can't imagine just sitting there you know week after week have to be home at a certain time to watch these reality shows and i'm thinking you know a lot ah maybe their lifestyle is just not so demanding that they have kind of time 

310.50 312.29 B: yeah um 

311.21 319.24 A: 'cause i mean if i miss survivor i'm not gonna die one way or the other [laughter] because it it's it's not that you know 

315.68 316.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

316.35 317.80 B: and yeah 

319.56 328.58 B: i think they you know somehow or some way they have to have some type of not acting but premeditated whatever they call it 

328.39 329.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

328.82 335.78 B: um things where they do it because you know they they must cut some things out they don't put everything in 

335.30 336.87 A: [cough] right 

336.14 338.23 B: (( so that that wouldn't be cons- )) 

338.32 339.24 B: you know 

338.52 351.25 A: [cough] that's what i was thinking too 'cause um [noise] after they did a joe millionaire thing and it showed some of the the different things that they deleted [noise] you know after he had um picked the one that he wanted to be with or whatever 

347.21 348.15 B: uh-huh 

351.16 356.88 A: and when they found out that he wasn't wealthy they really did th- that girl didn't want to be with him either 

351.17 352.06 B: yeah 

356.90 357.84 B: mhm 

358.27 368.85 A: [noise] [noise] even if they got a new one a new show out where um they're gonna actually pick somebody where even you wanna marry this person [noise] and it's like you can't turn back or whatever 

368.88 369.79 B: uh-huh 

369.24 372.67 A: i don't know if it came out yet but it it's supposed to 

373.41 378.28 B: is it that like the one on fox i think all the shows on fox are messed up you know 

377.75 378.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

378.39 383.75 A: mm [laughter] i don't know i just i had seen the preview of it but i don't know [noise] 

379.77 380.70 B: i mean 

384.95 386.43 B: no um 

385.58 389.61 A: i've seen the one where the guys had the masks on their face and then 

388.77 389.79 B: you know the 

389.68 395.14 A: and they were and the one guy got upset so he pulled his mask off he was like forget this [noise] 

395.03 403.30 B: i think the only the only reality show that ah that i used to watch and i don't know if it would be considered a reality show was you know that m._t._v. show 

403.90 408.43 A: yeah um real world yeah [laughter] 

404.88 406.46 B: the real world 

407.17 415.87 B: i that's the only one that was actually you know kind of into it that it was i don't think they acted or anything it was just something 

409.94 410.97 A: [laughter] 

411.75 413.33 A: mhm 

414.74 421.54 A: oh yeah 'cause they did yeah i think that was you're right that was a good one that was a good one 'cause i caught that a couple of times 

418.76 419.71 B: yeah 

421.14 428.90 B: yeah so i mean that's the only one that would actually think that was a reality show oth- all those like you know they're playing for money 

429.22 432.83 B: so i to me they're not they're acting you know because when 

430.81 432.79 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] [laughter] )) 

432.89 436.43 B: people a lot of people think they are not but you know they're actually 

436.38 439.00 A: yeah 'cause they get angry and everything 

439.00 440.33 B: yeah 

439.77 444.81 A: yeah and i have watched um you know where they the wrestling the people that are trying to be wrestlers [noise] 

444.53 445.73 B: (( yeah )) 

444.98 455.13 A: [noise] and they have to show 'em like training and things like that [noise] [noise] now those shows are people's tempers tempers are real high like they get really mad at one point 

448.80 449.74 B: mhm 

452.88 453.76 B: (( yeah )) 

454.99 461.18 A: 'cause i think one time this guy accidently kicked this guy in the face and he kept kicking the guy in the face 'cause he couldn't do the stunt 

461.03 471.70 A: and the guy turned around to him and you kick me one more time in my face and i'm gonna punch you dead in your chest and he was like really you could tell that he was really angry 'cause he was tired of the guy not being able to do it 

471.73 472.60 B: uh-huh 

472.22 481.09 A: [noise] so um i guess you got some real some some of 'em are really real and then some of 'em you can tell that [noise] the people are just pretending
