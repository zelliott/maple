0.18 2.10 A: hi i'm tiffany 

1.63 3.35 B: hi i'm marnie 

3.63 10.35 A: um well i guess we're supposed to discuss about what the u._s. is going to do uh about iraq 

9.86 10.91 B: right 

11.10 13.50 A: so you can start [laughter] 

13.04 14.05 B: okay 

14.72 16.75 B: let's see um 

16.81 26.48 B: i think that the u._s. needs to h- we need to have some kind of hand in there because they haven't i from my feeling from watching the news 

26.31 34.19 B: is that they the iraqis from being under saddam hussein for so long the only thing they know is to do what he says 

34.09 45.40 B: and if we don't if we or the british or any other country don't step in and like try to help him along in a more peaceful or a democracy whatever direction 

45.62 52.24 B: then they're just going to keep going like you know a hamster in a wheel it just keeps going and doing what they've been taught 

52.78 55.29 A: okay so do you think that um 

55.33 67.86 A: ir- people that are in iraq should be allowed to um continue having um weapons of mass destruction um once uh they get a new government established 

67.83 74.26 B: um i don't think they do for a number of years until um we know that we can trust them more 

74.76 88.08 A: i agree um i i feel that they should go in and i think that they should do a type of martial law and since we have so many problems with the people opposing what we're trying to do over there 

88.03 96.06 A: um and americans are getting killed over there i think they should take away all of the guns get someone from the u._n. in there to run iraq 

96.03 106.62 A: and um make some type of government control so they don't have all those problems and so much looting and beating and fighting and you know and everything over what we've 

106.64 109.26 A: ha- what we've had uh happen over there 

108.90 110.20 B: right i agree 

109.84 115.32 A: and they shouldn't have arms they you know shouldn't be allowed to have arms um i feel that 

115.75 118.79 A: that we need to be running things over there [mn] 

118.44 130.42 B: right we just have to be careful about we're not seen even though we're probably already seen as just like this anyway like a like a colonial imperial power like we don't we shouldn't be seen like that 'cause we're not trying to like annex it you know what i mean 

129.86 131.06 A: yeah 

130.31 135.08 B: but y- we need to have a presence but not seem like we're taking over you know 

134.85 141.93 A: because apparently we must be a major threat if people are you know are still shooting the americans and doing all of that 

140.37 145.18 B: well they don't like westerners that's the problem they don't like they don't like the west 

145.26 153.27 A: so is there not anybody in the u._n. um that they could get over there that iraq would um feel less threatened by maybe they should do that 

152.69 163.08 B: well the problem is like other countries that would be potential allies for us are so embedded in the oil trade with iraq and the other 

162.93 172.29 B: um arab countries that they're afraid to do anything because they'd lose their lucrative oil deals that's that's why france and all those other countries in europe didn't get involved 

172.52 182.49 A: why can't we just take everybody i- in iraq move 'em to iran and syria and turkey and we'll just keep iraq as our you know the the united nations oil 

179.27 180.82 B: (( [mn] 'cause yeah )) 

182.50 191.30 B: yeah well the problem is if you put them all in those countries there's already plenty of terrorist camps and anti west sentiments in those countries 

183.30 184.85 A: [laughter] 

191.22 205.22 B: you know and it's scary enough i mean i spent a year living in jerusalem in israel and it was pretty scary with you know with what's going on because they see there's a lot of americans a lot of foreigners you know and they 

205.20 210.87 B: any anything western they just don't like and it's not just iraq it's all the a- arabic countries 

210.80 215.74 A: so do you feel then that iraq should be disarmed for a number of years 

215.37 220.46 B: absolutely until the new government is shown to prove itself to be trustworthy 

220.39 224.57 A: and who do you think should be in charge of uh this new government 

224.17 225.50 B: (( i have no idea )) 

225.27 229.58 A: [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] 

225.94 227.32 B: (( [laughter] somebody )) 

227.47 228.56 B: [laughter] 

229.54 233.61 B: but i couldn't tell you who to put in charge but somebody else 

233.75 235.12 B: [laughter] 

234.81 241.70 A: okay so we should go in there and we should basically remove all of the rest of their weapons 

241.45 242.54 B: right 

241.92 243.56 A: and what should we do with them 

244.30 245.46 B: um 

245.18 246.45 A: [laughter] 

245.96 247.90 B: give them to our allies 

247.76 251.02 A: so we we should give 'em away to other people 

251.36 252.21 B: or just 

251.43 257.42 A: that don't have as like maybe like the afghanis we took all their planes and bombed everything that we should give them some 

255.80 265.19 B: well i don't think we should give them to afghanistan but [mn] but give 'em to people that that we know are our allies or we should just destroy them or keep 'em for ourselves [mn] 

257.64 259.89 A: [laughter] 

264.85 266.43 A: [laughter] 

265.68 267.45 B: [laughter] i don't know 

267.36 271.22 A: or maybe even divided to the united nations and we all take a little bit 

271.34 282.92 B: yeah but that's still i think you know a little dangerous to to say hey lebanon have some guns you can point them you know at america take some more hostages 

274.22 275.15 A: yeah 

281.27 289.07 A: so do you feel that what we've done uh so far as right or wrong are you for what they've done um in iraq 

289.13 290.12 B: i'm 

290.15 294.97 B: a little bit i i'm kind of seeing it on like both sides of the issue 

294.29 299.52 A: are you number five on a scale of one to ten ten being for the war and one being against the war 

299.09 301.49 B: yeah i'm i'm around in the middle 

301.02 311.69 A: that's where i'm at too i see reason but i don't know if it's it's the paparazzi and the propaganda in america that's making me see the other side i was anti it for so long 

311.43 312.37 B: right 

312.88 317.17 A: [mn] but i do feel the arms problem is a major issue 

316.88 317.95 B: mhm 

317.76 327.93 A: um but then again i feel that they don't have what uh they said that they had you know i mean w- why we went over there in the first place they never found all these chemical weapons and things that you know 

327.05 336.21 B: right but they were a perceived perceived threat you know and also george bush had to finish what his daddy started so that that's the other issue you know 

330.48 331.46 A: yeah 

335.83 343.81 A: well we still have osama running around we still have saddam hussein running around now what have these two wars accomplished 

340.02 340.83 B: right 

344.31 351.04 B: yeah they just kinda put us over there and made most of the world hate us i think that's what it accomplished [laughter] 

345.80 346.49 A: (( [mn] )) 

349.45 350.66 A: yeah 

351.11 351.93 A: (( hm )) 

352.02 353.02 A: so [mn] 

353.00 365.05 B: it's like a never ending cycle like even if like we get some kind of stability there some other dictator's going to rise up and start something that's like there's such turmoil in that part of the world because they're caught between 

359.43 360.94 A: that's the way i feel 

364.88 376.45 B: their culture and the rest of the world's culture like they're totally caught between being you know being muslims and trying to fit in with the west and that's the problem 

376.28 377.30 A: yeah 

377.63 378.44 A: hm 

378.46 390.87 A: so what what what are we supposed to do i mean shall we continue what we're doing um do you feel that that's the right thing that we're doing now just trying to kind of rebuild iraq and just keep make sure that people aren't destroying it or um 

390.95 397.28 A: should we go over there and like i said go take all of the guns and all the weapons from all the civilians 

397.62 404.98 A: um you know so that there can't be running around playing terrorists or looting or stealing or killing 

404.85 417.23 B: right both of those ideas you know sound pretty decent but they'll alw- even if we take stuff away they'll they could always you know get stuff from a neighboring country there's always contraband and stuff going on 

416.21 423.67 A: yes so basically you're saying that if we disarm iraq there really is no good because they'll get more guns and more um arms 

419.16 421.37 B: they're just going to replenish themselves 

421.59 422.52 B: right 

423.17 426.45 B: right it's a never ending vicious cycle that's the problem [mn] 

425.74 427.60 A: so you think we're wasting our time 

427.42 432.88 B: um i don't think we're wasting our time because as stuff comes in you know we're taking it away 

428.55 429.87 A: [laughter] 

432.92 438.45 B: or however it's going to work as we find things and take it away so they maybe will get some new stuff and hopefully we'll find it again 

437.95 439.76 A: so they can't get a surplus 

439.36 448.86 B: right so they can only hopefully get the bare minimum hopefully you know and if we keep finding it and taking it out maybe eventually you know kind of like pavlov the dog look at the picture 

448.80 449.88 A: yeah 

449.29 449.93 B: (( [mn] )) 

450.31 451.16 A: hm 

451.06 452.93 B: but who knows it's it's 

453.11 454.40 B: just really 

454.44 458.98 B: scary and you know it's just culture clash that's the problem 

459.09 462.60 A: do you feel that if we disarmed iraq that it would end terrorism 

462.86 463.93 B: uh no 

463.93 465.24 A: [laughter] 

464.87 466.35 B: [mn] not at all [mn] 

466.12 476.01 A: um what do you feel that they uh think we're going to accomplish if we uh what what do you think they're trying to disarm i mean do you th- they're just trying to take the weapons of mass destruction 

476.25 478.67 B: i think so anything that could do like 

478.02 479.28 A: chemicals 

478.76 485.50 B: chemicals anything that could harm like destroy the land and lots of people you know 

485.53 488.13 B: like chemical weapons they're pretty scary [mn] 

487.86 494.95 A: so you don't feel iraqis have a cause in resisting and um you don't feel that they have a reason to fight for what they believe in 

495.17 508.79 B: well i think what they're like the not like the government people but like the every day civilians like they're angry because i think they they feel that their culture is being taken over and they're you know and they don't want their children to be killed 

500.95 501.74 A: mhm 

508.83 521.66 B: you know so like every day iraqis like i think they're angry because they see us coming in and like trying to take over but then there's the government people that they themselves want to take over the world or or take over or demolish 

521.63 529.30 B: capitalism in the west in the west so i think we have to be more sympathetic to the civilians than to the government people 

528.54 530.78 A: so what do you think the u._s. should do about it [mn] 

532.88 538.68 B: like show the civilians that we're r- that we're willing to like help rebuild their city like you mentioned before 

538.07 542.81 A: but aren't we doing that and aren't they still like trying to kill our marines and fight us 

539.26 540.11 B: yeah 

541.60 545.96 B: yeah yeah because they see us as intruders that's the problem 

543.26 544.61 A: so what can we do 

544.89 548.84 A: what can we do to make 'em um let us disarm peacefully 

549.10 550.76 B: i don't know maybe 

551.08 562.85 B: i don't maybe we could get like if there is ir- like there are plenty like you know iraqis living in america maybe we could have some of them be like spokespeople and be like it's okay we're trying to help you look we live here we're fine you know 

562.74 573.48 B: like let the americans help you that that way they have something to identify with not like you know people different culture different colors coming in and saying hey do what we say that way it's someone just like them 

562.76 563.80 A: yeah 

571.93 574.66 A: all of the iraqis i've met are for the war 

574.86 578.40 B: really oh okay well then never mind [mn] 

575.53 576.32 A: yeah 

577.76 583.29 A: all the ones that i mean here in america are for the war that we're doing that americans are trying to help 

579.96 580.79 B: mhm 

583.12 584.68 B: okay okay 

584.58 587.59 A: you know i mean like the guys at seven eleven you know what i mean 

587.14 588.12 B: mhm 

588.07 590.02 A: they're they're totally for it 

590.28 594.95 A: you know they think that uh we should definitely stop whatever's going on over there 

594.02 599.95 B: because they probably left left the left iraq to come here so they could live a normal life because hussein was like te-
