2.17 3.50 B: hello 

3.06 4.62 A: hi this is dianne 

4.22 5.60 B: hi i'm dawn 

5.41 7.03 A: hi how ya doing dawn 

6.30 7.58 B: oh okay 

7.80 11.23 A: i had a little bit of trouble hearing what the topic was 

10.85 24.53 B: yeah me as well um it's regarding iraq uh whether we feel you know what is our opinion uh whether they should arm them or whether they should um how should they go about handling the war with iraq 

24.39 29.71 A: uh-huh okay i have some certain thoughts what are your feelings 

28.88 29.77 B: um 

30.62 38.78 B: i'm not really sure how i feel because i know that like weapons uh you know the use of weapons just escalates problems 

39.35 41.40 A: that's that's true too 

39.87 40.53 B: you 

41.47 47.50 B: know but then with some people it's like you have to treat them the way they act 

47.83 49.24 A: exactly 

47.98 53.18 B: and and they haven't been acting towards uh the u._s. very nicely 

54.38 58.53 A: no they haven't it's kind of a double blade sword there that's for sure 

55.19 56.32 B: right 

57.33 60.63 B: exactly exactly 

59.13 66.28 A: [cough] i think we do need to arm their military i mean once everything's re- reformed 

66.60 69.39 A: and and their police the policing 

70.39 78.77 B: yes definitely i mean i think i mean i don't know do you feel that the president is doing his and the mayor is doing this his part 

79.21 80.42 B: like i s- 

80.66 83.14 B: i somewhat feel that uh 

83.35 96.40 B: they're siding with uh iraq too much like they're favor i feel they're favor- uh that the president is favoring iraq and he's not doing what he can to uh protect us 

97.95 99.05 A: um 

99.53 100.39 A: it's 

101.13 107.73 A: they picked such a tough subject this is my first call and they probably picked a tough subject 'cause i've got a brother in special forces that's over there 

107.13 108.63 B: oh wow 

108.34 109.93 A: so um 

110.60 118.40 A: you know i really think that i think for the media it's it's probably put out there to 

112.33 113.21 B: are you 

113.71 114.64 B: uh-huh 

119.50 122.96 A: look that way i m- i i really don't know 

122.79 124.54 B: are you from new york 

124.26 127.07 A: no i'm not i'm from north carolina 

126.76 129.88 B: oh okay because i i'm in new york yeah 

129.77 130.81 A: (( oh yeah )) 

129.98 136.70 B: so i mean i don't know like if your president because i know we oh no well yeah we have the same president and the same mayor 

137.41 139.28 B: (( you know so i mean it's a so )) 

140.01 148.25 B: you know i think it lies the problem really lies with you know the type of security and the type of actions that uh they're going to take 

148.28 150.75 B: (( you know that plays a part for all of us )) 

150.49 158.17 A: [noise] [mn] exactly but i do think it's going to be years in the making i just don't think it's something they're going to be able to go in and 

154.63 156.05 B: oh really 

158.40 161.18 A: bing bang bomb it's done in a month 

161.14 162.14 B: wow 

161.59 170.87 A: i think it's gonna be years of rebuilding years of of retraining because these people were in the thought process of hate 

171.33 176.54 A: and they were geared that way and they lived that way and if they didn't they were they were killed 

176.48 177.38 B: (( mm )) 

177.19 183.29 A: so i think it's going to take years of commitment by the united states and and other 

184.46 189.08 A: um top countries to go in there and really make a difference because i feel 

188.03 189.01 B: (( mm )) 

189.24 191.96 A: if we don't do something to change 

192.49 206.70 A: the way that they've lived and the only message that they know that things are not going to improve whatsoever for them i mean we can go in and rebuild all we want but unless unless we give them the ability and the knowledge 

207.18 209.87 A: and the example of how to 

209.90 212.09 A: run a country how to 

212.18 213.36 A: live 

213.96 219.40 A: in non hate and acceptance i think i just think it's all gonna be for naught because 

219.59 225.72 A: my personal feeling is that whether they get saddam hussein 

225.89 233.46 A: or bin laden or whoever in any of these other countries it's really not going to matter because they are merely 

227.70 229.03 B: [laughter] 

233.57 234.59 A: the way 

234.69 237.03 A: i figure it is a cancer 

237.05 241.12 A: and it's a malignancy and just by removing 

242.22 245.56 A: that one growth it is still already spread 

245.29 248.29 B: right because they have other people that are under them 

247.78 251.51 A: exactly so we have to treat the entire 

251.19 252.41 B: exactly 

251.94 259.22 A: population in order to ever ever change anything and i just don't think that's going to be an overnight process 

260.73 261.87 B: oh yeah i mean 

261.75 276.38 B: like what was it about a month or two ago when we had such scares that they could bomb us that you know we cou- we were under uh terroris- we were going to be terrorized i mean we would never know when or how 

276.68 291.16 B: i mean you know imagine just like walking down the street one day and like fainting and never waking up you know but you know they're putting poisonous gases in the air or you know whether they're just gonna blow us up at any given moment 

290.38 303.31 A: exactly but this is w- it's hard for us to understand living in a free society what the people of these other countries this is the way they live all the time this is all they know i mean it's not 

291.80 293.25 B: i mean that's 

298.17 298.96 B: (( mm )) 

301.24 302.41 B: oh wow 

303.56 307.81 A: i mean if i saw a tank driving down my street 

307.96 309.82 A: i would just like panic 

310.05 314.62 A: but these people are used to seeing this i mean they go to sleep at night hearing bombs and it's 

314.65 319.41 A: and it's long before we came in you know as in the united states and uh 

319.54 320.71 B: mhm 

320.02 324.51 A: and the coalition it's just that these people this is what they know and i think 

324.52 326.98 A: we just really have to try to 

327.52 333.39 A: change their thinking process to that this is not acceptable 

333.57 336.03 A: and then who's to say i mean you know they 

337.79 343.79 A: i i wonder are we any better than they are trying to force our beliefs on them i don't know 

344.65 347.74 A: but i mean you know it's d- during the fall of uh 

349.35 351.52 A: russia there many people 

351.66 363.09 A: many civilians they they died because they didn't know how to defend themselves and and they doofed themselves due to the fact that the government had always taken care of them maybe the government took care of them poorly 

362.94 364.49 B: mhm [noise] 

363.70 377.36 A: but the fact remains that they were taken care of and so when they were left to make their own living and supply their own rent and their own medicines many of them just couldn't survive it so we've got a lot of work ahead of us 

377.42 381.63 A: you know we we bit off a big piece here but i think in order to 

382.24 384.49 A: ensure our safety 

384.68 386.89 A: it was something that had to be done 

387.18 391.02 A: i mean i'm in i'm in an agreement that it had to be done 

391.05 392.58 B: (( [noise] right )) 

391.11 395.16 A: i wish it i just wish it hadn't had to have been done 

394.36 403.03 B: [noise] but you know what the thing is i mean in this place another big part uh we never went over there just like uh 

403.33 405.82 B: how do we say um just 

406.59 409.10 B: um oh what am i looking for 

409.26 412.72 B: just bombing their country you know i mean just 

413.76 417.27 B: blowing up a plane hijacking a plane i mean 

417.08 427.45 B: we never did any or u- uni- united states people never did anything like that to them i mean why you know why in the world you know would they take it upon themselves to like 

427.26 434.46 B: you know hijack a plane and like kill thousands and thou- innocent thou- thousands of innocent people 

433.75 436.44 A: because these people are bred in hate 

436.28 437.69 B: (( oh god )) 

437.29 448.52 A: i mean this is all they know i mean they don't have c._n._n. and they don't have they got the iraqi t._v. which they're listening to what they are being told which is what 

448.61 454.51 A: the government wants them to hear and they're brought up from a very young age to hate hate hate 

455.00 468.70 A: and i mean they live in such poverty that you know someone tells them well you go ahead and hijack this plane and i'll make sure that your family gets ten thousand dollars well they're so they're so desperate 

466.15 467.69 B: oh wow 

468.77 471.60 A: that they go ahead and they do these things and there's no 

471.64 476.92 A: telling that there's any follow up that what has been promised them obviously is going to happen 

476.61 478.10 B: mhm [noise] 

476.96 479.54 A: the reason for all these suicides 

480.32 481.24 B: right 

480.80 484.49 A: folks and stuff you know what would possess a person to 

484.63 493.95 A: arm themselves with a bomb and and walk into a group of people i mean it's just the mindset i mean they killed people that the kids they went to um 

494.85 504.21 A: the homes to recruit young men into the military after the conflict started and if they refused to go they killed one of their siblings 

503.65 504.67 B: (( mm )) 

504.90 510.27 A: and and they would continue to do it till they went so these people had no choice 

510.54 512.88 A: they they know no other way 

513.18 514.29 B: (( [noise] hm )) 

514.40 515.72 A: it meant 

516.10 526.29 A: i i don't know i we've got a lot of work not only rebuilding the the country and the physical structures but we've got to try and get to the people and i think 

526.82 533.42 A: the older they are the more difficult it's gonna be because their minds are made up it's 'cause it's all they know 

534.91 541.10 A: you know the old the old adage we we live what we learn this is what they've learned 

535.58 536.71 B: right 

542.32 544.89 A: so we have a big job 

545.15 546.82 A: ahead of us but i 

546.93 551.76 A: i did think i heard on the question something about arming them and i do think that we 

551.29 552.31 B: yes 

551.90 553.75 A: you know they do need to be 

553.76 566.22 A: they need to be able to be self protected i mean our military our law enforcement agencies all have weapons i'm not saying that we should go into every household and say here here's a grenade 

556.97 557.83 B: right 

566.84 575.83 A: but i think for them to live in a dem- democratic they've got to be able to have the same choices than any other democracy has that if they 

576.74 579.23 A: they want they can have you know what i'm saying 

578.30 579.95 B: [noise] mhm 

581.66 582.74 A: i don't know 

582.83 589.77 A: i i don't i just don't think it's and from talking to like i said my brother i just don't think this is going to be a short 

590.23 595.34 A: short term goal this is this is going to be a very long process 

596.40 599.89 B: yeah either that or you know many people are gonna
