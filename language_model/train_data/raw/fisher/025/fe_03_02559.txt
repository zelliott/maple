133.73 144.71 B: that's right exactly yeah i think there was a lot of um i think there was just a lot of propaganda and i think there was i i i think that we didn't get to see a lot of the stuff that was really going on you know 

144.67 145.65 A: yeah but 

145.98 153.06 A: you know if we i wish we had got u._s. i mean u._n. sanction to go over there and do this thing because 

153.17 154.06 A: we 

154.12 159.37 A: and as far as the world concerned we look like almost like invaders almost 

159.24 171.03 A: everybody a lot of countries started coming on board once we got in there a lot of other sort of countries started coming on board to support but that's only after we got and and one thing else i don't like believe

191.15 205.09 A: and topple his regime a lot of other countries oh yeah that's a good idea then and we we support you in it but before that everybody no we don't do it we should take another vote on it and everybody was against it and then when what 

192.68 193.73 B: mhm 

204.96 209.52 A: the actual conflict started a lot of people started supporting it 

206.93 207.80 B: uh-huh 

208.93 211.05 B: do you remember do you know who 

210.86 214.89 A: i know france was one of those and then fra- and 

214.10 217.77 B: well i know that france wasn't supporting but have they come on board now 

217.41 223.38 A: well they they more in line with what took place now and the germans and that and you know like 

221.77 222.73 B: okay 

223.78 230.80 A: one thing they wanna go in like right now and you know there's a lot of money to be made because they gotta rebuild the country they gotta 

229.94 231.81 B: right all the oil 

230.60 241.05 A: get the oil wells and everything got to get all that stuff up and running doing ah reconstruction and and i understood there was over seven hundred and something million dollars or a billion dollars worth of 

233.97 235.03 B: mhm 

235.92 237.24 B: mhm 

241.01 248.61 A: of companies that go in there and and gonna go in there after the war to do the rebuilding and the reconstruction of the area and you know 

247.14 248.12 B: oh my gosh 

250.17 253.22 A: united states and britain they led the 

253.34 261.43 A: led the ah fight in there and now a lot of other countries wanna go in there and partake of all the as they say the spoils of war 

261.16 262.32 B: mhm 

262.61 269.38 B: yeah that's [laughter] i think it's kind of funny that that happens but they said that that would i mean that something the people predicted too 

269.23 277.66 B: is that they would go in you know that once once they found out or once they defeated them then or defeated the regime that um 

277.15 284.53 A: yeah because they would never that was that was gonna happen then because we knew that was gonna happen even if united states had to lead it by themselves 

280.20 281.00 B: (( right )) 

284.23 288.70 B: mhm well we did have britain's support thank thank goodness 

287.26 288.27 A: (( yeah that mhm )) 

288.88 294.04 B: i'm pretty thankful for that now do you think that um that um it's important 

294.40 298.59 B: for the reg- or do you think that's important that there is a regime change 

298.75 300.89 A: i think that re- there's a 

301.06 307.04 A: there's a a big imp- big important reason that they should have a regime change because 

307.47 314.63 A: at at everywhere all like when the soviet union fell all these countries that was under the soviet block 

314.69 324.22 A: they started wanted break away and they wanted their own freedom and just like iraq the in people in iraq they want freedom they were under saddam's thumb for so long 

318.14 319.17 B: mhm 

323.89 324.91 B: mhm 

324.22 330.47 A: they didn't know they could say nothing they could do nothing that he didn't like now they want their own freedom but i think it gonna 

330.49 338.24 A: it gonna be a a disaster just like the soviet union because you got the kurds and then you got the other people ah the o- 

338.48 340.36 A: (( the kurds in the north and um )) 

341.11 341.98 A: (( ah )) 

342.15 350.20 A: i forgot the ones in the south but you know each one of them wants to rule their own part of the country so it gonna be a turmoil in there 

348.26 349.19 B: right 

349.97 354.21 B: (( mhm mhm yeah that's that's that's right )) 

353.21 354.62 A: but there's one thing i 

354.66 357.34 A: i'd like the this country said 

357.63 366.79 A: you know we used to go in somewhere and we'd set up a government so but we they said they want the iraqis they ah to rule theirselves 

366.90 372.56 A: yeah we could help them set up the government but no we not gonna tell you who to who 

368.72 369.79 B: right 

372.42 373.63 B: to put in place 

372.77 378.76 A: who to put in place and who gonna d- you know this is your country you rule it but we do not want 

374.01 374.88 B: right 

377.05 377.93 B: right 

378.57 390.80 B: well it's like kuwait like you know after liberating kuwait i mean the same thing happened right i mean i mean if you look at the country now it's you know flourishing and and they're being run by people i mean they're not oppressed and they're being run by 

378.83 379.52 A: (( to )) 

379.60 380.64 A: yeah 

383.40 384.05 A: (( mm )) 

390.81 396.20 B: you know u._s. friendly but at the same time they're you know i guess kuwaiti picked right 

395.64 400.10 A: right but that's one thing i i you know there's a lot of 

396.33 397.41 B: yeah so 

400.30 401.54 A: i think we should 

401.58 405.16 A: yeah we should keep some type of force there so we can 

405.78 415.69 A: drown any type of resurgence resurgent activity that might pop up but you know we should get as many people out of out of that country as fast as possible because 

410.27 411.05 B: (( mm )) 

415.66 426.70 A: there's a lot of anti american sentiment in that country there's a lot of although they love what we did we we toppled a reg- regime a lot of 'em they don't like american because 

418.82 419.96 B: oh yeah 

423.82 424.59 B: (( mm )) 

426.85 431.56 A: america is always perceived as the country with all the power with all the money and then 

426.93 428.20 B: well they've heard about it 

428.97 429.68 B: (( yeah )) 

432.08 437.71 B: well they've taught them it's in the education system different things about you know the americans so 

432.16 433.11 A: (( and )) 

434.56 435.46 A: yeah 

437.74 445.54 B: you know that makes that totally makes sense but i think that you know once there there's like a change over then they'll get a different perspective on the whole thing 

444.56 446.85 A: yeah and you know like 

446.93 453.14 A: the most of the most of the muslim countries i mean over there they still 

453.17 454.02 A: (( as )) 

454.13 465.53 A: if in the seventeenth eighteenth century where women like don't have any rights and they have to walk around [mn] and i think they need to put a government in there which is gonna be more supportive of human rights 

465.41 466.35 B: mhm 

465.49 469.88 A: all not not only men but all all people 

469.36 476.84 B: mhm yeah that's why you think it's ah important right do you think is is that like the major reason 

473.08 474.87 A: mhm 

478.15 479.20 A: say again 

478.25 480.30 B: that we get involved in iraq 

479.57 484.24 A: no i don't think i think i think the reason we got involved in iraq because 

484.36 486.35 A: well i got some personal reason but i 

486.17 493.31 A: that's not that's my opinion but i think we were got in there because of the atrocities that saddam 

493.10 507.23 A: would was committing against his own people and also because he supported terrorism the well we always know that iraq supports terrorism outside of its own borders 

495.88 496.67 B: mhm 

507.34 517.10 A: and i think that's one of the reason because we're trying to hit all the terrorist bases like even with looking at syria because syria supports terrorism 

516.76 517.81 B: right 

518.08 519.04 A: i think 

518.76 520.56 B: that's good i agree with you 

519.12 526.82 A: since nine eleven i think we trying to topple all the countries that support terrorism 

526.23 527.69 B: mhm 

528.17 530.14 B: and you think that's a good idea right 

530.94 544.77 A: i think it'd get a well i i think it's yes and no i think it's a good cut it's a good concept that's what i think but it's a idea you know all ideas is good when when put on paper but the reality is it 

536.98 537.98 B: right 

542.94 544.17 B: ideally 

544.94 556.18 A: by you going out there hitting at them they gonna bring the war closer to you if they if they want to think about you as a terrorist targets and now they just say oh they come in our area now now we gotta go to l._a. to get them 

555.54 556.72 B: mhm 

556.80 562.63 B: yeah yeah i kind of see what you're saying but i think i think that even though um 

562.69 572.62 B: i think that if you break it down becau- [mn] it would be really hard to break down just the united states and just kind of take out the whole united states and so they have to resort to kind of terrorist activity 

571.93 586.76 A: yeah no they're not gonna take they're not they can only hit sections of the united states i mean but th- the concept of millions of people like the world trade center when all those innocent people that never had they probably never even seen the country even heard about the 

575.78 576.64 B: right 

586.30 587.53 B: uh-huh 

586.96 593.62 A: the conflict they just somebody flew i don't ah they said bin laden supported that um but you know 

593.77 599.95 A: they didn't ever show us the evidence they said they got evidence and um but you know we as americans we got the right to know who did it but
