9.03 10.43 B: hi how are you mac 

10.51 12.51 A: uh i'm pretty good 

12.03 13.19 B: okay 

12.85 16.11 A: so what do you think about disarming iraq 

16.24 30.44 B: well i feel well me being ex military i'm all for it for one you never know what they have uh uh too because i used to be when i was in the navy i used to go round and board uh ships 

18.94 19.85 A: yeah 

22.90 23.88 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

26.78 27.37 A: (( [noise] )) 

30.48 36.89 B: and you you would swear up and down that these ships would be like uh just regular freighters or 

37.06 44.39 B: passenger ships you know yachts and stuff and you wouldn't believe how much drugs and guns they would they would transport 

43.78 44.98 A: really 

44.41 49.96 B: yeah so i mean i'm all for it and i know for a fact for them to be 

51.67 65.80 B: in the middle of all that like for instance israel iran and all that in the middle right in the middle of everything they they had to have had some powerful stuff over there otherwise they would have taken 'em over years ago 

59.17 60.05 A: mhm 

65.66 67.00 A: yeah 

66.46 72.35 B: so i feel yeah they should they should disarm them a hundred percent 

71.71 78.75 A: yeah i feel like we should disarm iraq right now um i really don't know too much about military or politics because 

78.82 85.20 A: i just recently over the past conflict got involved in you know the politics 

85.17 95.17 A: of the war and i'm just sixteen years old but i think that yeah there's definitely a big conflict going on over there and that 

95.28 103.50 A: you know right now it may just affect their part of the world but pretty soon after it's done there it's going to escalate to everywhere else 

103.01 104.29 B: (( mhm absolutely )) 

103.72 105.59 A: it's just gonna spread you know 

105.39 110.49 B: yeah and i think the next place they're going to go after is going to be korea 

110.19 115.05 A: [cough] yeah that or russia i'm thinking because of the nuclear technology 

113.21 114.16 B: (( no )) 

114.41 118.36 B: oh no 'cause russia's free west they're they're 

119.15 129.30 B: ever since the cold war they're more they're more a a debt with u._s. but north korea they have the capability of bombing us now and then we don't get along with them too well so 

129.15 130.60 A: oh yeah 

129.94 132.63 B: so i see they're gonna be next 

132.56 133.65 A: yeah 

133.06 135.76 B: they're gonna have to do something real big 

136.07 141.63 B: with them because maybe try to strike them they're gonna try to nuke us 

142.01 145.27 A: yeah i could see that happening pretty easily 

145.70 148.11 A: what do you think about the chemical weapons 

148.41 151.60 B: i well i don't did they find some 

151.85 155.51 A: um i heard they found five hundred gallons of anthrax 

155.54 156.45 B: (( hm )) 

156.55 158.01 B: five hundred gallons 

158.40 161.43 A: yeah and i also heard that they found um 

161.85 171.04 A: oh those sanitation suits those um chem proof suits in a hospital at one of the main hospitals in iraq 

171.43 176.83 A: like supposedly one that all the iraqi leaders were supposed to be using 

176.19 177.59 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

177.36 186.91 A: and i think they found like just enough suits um for the people inside the hospital like that's you know suggesting they were going to 

187.31 190.75 A: start or plan an attack 

190.53 193.33 B: good thing we stopped them when we did 

192.79 193.72 A: mhm 

193.42 196.31 B: see 'cause years ago my my ex wife 

195.97 196.65 A: (( [cough] )) 

196.41 198.62 B: she was in the service and she was 

198.67 202.87 B: she was over there at the first during the first war 

202.65 203.99 A: mhm 

203.58 208.75 B: and so they should have disarmed them back then 'cause otherwise they wouldn't have gotten this far 

209.22 211.78 A: yeah i agree with that 

210.66 212.94 B: yeah see and then right now 

213.01 217.42 B: i know a lot of their people's gonna be tried for war crimes and everything because 

217.81 220.15 B: they were they were killing 

220.55 226.44 B: soldiers you know after they got 'em and they were prisoners of war they just executed them 

226.09 227.88 A: yeah 

226.77 230.74 B: you know and that's it's against the geneva convention 

231.13 235.99 A: yeah it is that's another thing they don't really fight clean they always fight dirty 

232.09 232.97 B: (( so )) 

235.72 248.35 B: yeah same thing and they're wondering they're they're raising hell and high water now that everybody see right now they should go in there and take everybody's weapons they shouldn't even leave guns in there 

248.47 250.03 A: yeah 

249.22 258.67 B: because right now that's how they're they're doing those suicide bombings the grenades and all that junk and killing the killing the you know people now 

254.39 255.24 A: (( [cough] )) 

258.45 260.20 A: yeah 

259.42 260.38 B: so 

261.10 262.97 B: (( yeah they should go in there )) 

263.12 267.65 B: and i'm all for it i feel they they pulled out too easy t- too soon 

267.85 275.34 A: yeah i think so too i i didn't think that they got too much proof of you know getting too many of the leaders 

275.13 285.74 B: yeah see in just the same way i i'm totally disappointed because they didn't find bin laden yet so i mean it's like anyone could just disappear you know 

285.06 288.29 A: yeah it's like everybody just forgot about him overnight 

287.71 292.82 B: [mn] yeah then all of a sudden if say right here in the in their own u._s. 

292.78 302.92 B: if if you're wanted they look for you and they put your face in everything and they will continue hunting you till they get you well they're all i don't seem 'em trying to hunt 'em down 

295.10 296.91 A: mhm 

303.45 305.19 A: yeah me neither 

304.78 305.69 B: so 

306.00 307.04 B: (( so it's [mn] )) 

307.44 312.86 A: seems like after the first year they just kinda like gave up and focused on another target 

310.57 314.55 B: yeah yeah they're and they're the ones that are looking foolish 

314.41 315.82 A: mhm 

315.27 317.83 B: see 'cause uh bloody idiots 

317.92 320.90 A: yeah we made a lot of threats that we didn't follow through on

344.34 352.02 B: i i know they don't wanna be at peace with palestine and all that so the first thing they should do if they're not going to then why go through 

352.31 359.69 B: through peace talks okay if you're gonna continue bombing people and all that they should just well leave it alone 

353.79 355.17 A: exactly 

360.59 361.74 B: (( leave it alone )) 

361.59 366.60 A: yeah it's like a two thousand year old conflict i don't really think we're going to solve it any time soon

443.59 444.60 B: man 

444.67 449.41 B: so have they left are they gonna leave any troops now over there mhm 

448.85 456.90 A: uh i'm not sure i think they might be leaving just a few people to make sure that the politics um are going to come out all right like 

457.05 464.96 A: the politicians that the iraqis choose to lead them are gonna you know be 

465.15 469.72 A: i guess um cooperative with the rest of the world 

469.12 469.96 B: uh-huh 

470.42 478.66 A: so i just think they're going to leave a few yeah i heard that they're gonna leave a few people to make sure that everything stays all right when they leave 

479.80 481.87 B: [noise] oh that will work sure 

482.22 484.61 B: they need to they need the 

484.78 491.68 B: you know what they need to do they need to put somebody 'cause they have a lot of politicians here that are exiled 

491.47 493.06 A: mhm 

492.32 501.05 B: you know that they left the country when when saddam first they should go back and try to make things right 

501.24 514.69 A: yeah i think they should 'cause like so many people that left that were afraid of saddam that you know were actually good politicians that can now go back i think that they could do a lot of good for the country especially because they're natives 

514.24 515.34 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

514.70 518.90 A: i think if a politician that we choose goes in there 

519.58 520.84 A: to do work 

521.26 524.67 A: i really don't think that would work out at all because 

523.31 525.27 B: no they should 

524.79 527.29 A: you know it's not one of their own 

527.22 535.29 B: yeah don't blend in yeah how we gonna know what the trials and tribulations that they went through all those years we we weren't there 

533.55 534.57 A: yeah 

535.14 536.98 A: yeah exactly 

537.28 544.31 A: and we probably put a lot of our own rules on them that you know really wouldn't apply and would just cause matters to get worse 

543.80 545.58 B: yeah you're going 

546.87 547.73 A: (( [cough] )) 

547.12 551.45 B: [mn] well best to leave this has got to be a- this has got to be approved by the u._s. 

551.26 552.28 A: uh-huh 

552.25 554.53 B: 'cause for one they're they're not gonna 

554.97 561.03 B: they're not gonna what's a call they're not gonna put anyone that's not gonna help the u._s. out anyway so 

560.80 561.72 A: yeah 

561.51 562.45 B: see 

562.60 565.41 B: then we don't need them so [mn] 

565.22 567.89 A: yeah they're not gonna put a tyrant in power 

568.36 569.47 B: (( hell no )) 

569.74 573.02 B: sure no foreign [laughter] that's crazy 

573.55 575.77 B: so yeah 

574.92 581.52 A: [mn] i'm kinda surprised how the iraqis left the gas fields and the oil fields alone 

581.31 588.84 B: yeah i was surprised at that too i guess they were they weren't expecting [mn] expecting it like that 

586.72 587.72 A: yeah 

588.26 595.78 A: i guess it's probably because we you know first landed in kuwait and made sure that kuwait was the first thing secured 

596.96 598.59 A: the first area 

599.07 599.89 B: (( okay and that ))
