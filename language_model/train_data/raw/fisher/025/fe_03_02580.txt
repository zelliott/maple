0.25 2.22 A: (( hello i'm mia )) 

1.93 5.14 B: hi this is lisa [cough] hi 

3.38 4.47 A: hello 

5.04 7.71 A: uh well we got quite a topic 'cause 

7.28 11.46 B: y- yeah i- it's very timely for sure and to be honest i'm not 

11.89 14.54 B: as politically minded [laughter] so um 

13.99 19.42 A: well it seemed kinda like a point [laughter] at this point because we already did it [laughter] 

16.07 17.78 B: yeah 

18.39 23.14 B: yeah exactly we we took care of it it's kinda okay now what you know [cough] 

21.41 23.76 A: yeah it's gonna be a tough one 

23.96 31.09 B: um we yeah we we we definitely um brought down the hussein regime and now i guess we just have to 

31.45 37.02 B: install a new government [laughter] or help build a democracy there but 

33.15 34.79 A: (( i guess )) 

35.89 37.41 A: or something 

37.21 44.66 B: yeah who knows how that's gonna go i i don't really know what to expect sometimes i don't know seems like when you replace a leader 

45.42 50.24 B: later on the replacement becomes just kind of not so great also 

48.54 49.64 A: worse than 

49.83 51.09 A: yeah 

50.44 52.24 B: i mean over time you know 

51.62 55.80 A: no that's that's happened a lot so in history i guess 

53.23 55.20 B: (( [cough] yeah )) 

55.87 57.80 B: (( yeah )) 

56.00 58.52 A: that the cure is worse than the disease 

58.23 59.66 B: yeah 

59.43 64.05 A: i don't know i mean it seems like it's so tough over there now 'cause it's so chaotic 

63.83 66.99 B: definitely definitely so i can't imagine 

66.98 81.59 B: just what what the citizens are feeling and going through it's gotta be although [cough] they've been liberated it's gotta be somewhat traumatic because the whole way of life that you've known all of a sudden i mean even if it's bad you're like used to it and you just know how to work with it but then 

78.10 79.18 A: mhm 

80.73 81.51 A: mhm 

81.55 82.09 A: (( i )) 

82.12 86.21 B: somebody comes along and kinda changes everything and gives you all these freedoms but you don't really 

86.48 98.54 B: know exactly you know i i think just it's a massive change and i think some of them might be having a you know kind of a difficult time of figuring out what's going on and [mn] maybe even having some fears that you know somehow saddam hussein will 

92.76 93.74 A: (( think so )) 

94.37 95.45 A: yeah 

98.88 108.40 B: retaliate against the people or whatever for you know the ones who cheered when you know they brought a statue down and whatnot i don't know i mean i just can't imagine being in those two 

100.99 102.08 A: right 

108.16 109.25 A: i know 

109.06 109.86 B: (( [cough] )) 

109.34 113.90 A: well actually i saw one thing on t._v. one thing about a a family that iraq have um 

113.82 125.48 A: the husband and wife are both doctors they had worked for the government and they don't know when they're ever gonna get paid again they lost their home and they have their little two year old they have to live with their parents again and they just don't know what's going on 

115.57 116.55 B: mhm 

120.17 123.01 B: oh my god oh that's right 

125.23 131.23 B: oh oh my gosh i didn't think about that that's terrible but you're right that all the government employees it's like well 

127.98 128.86 A: i know 

130.75 135.16 A: yeah where [mn] where's their you know pay check gonna come from 

131.77 133.67 B: oh my gosh 

135.00 144.86 B: [cough] oh my gosh and they you know i mean not only for themselves but i'm sure they have families to feed and oh my gosh i didn't even that didn't even occur to me that's terrible 

135.25 136.59 A: which is awful 

139.38 140.93 A: mhm 

141.54 142.82 A: absolutely 

144.24 159.16 A: yeah that that was almost the worst part because it's like well if you were living in a slum it's probably going to be the same but if you were just having kind of a reasonably normal life you know as a professional or something you probably worked for the government 'cause there's not a lot i i wouldn't think private enterprise over there 

145.37 145.96 B: (( [cough] )) 

153.79 154.74 B: right 

158.70 162.13 B: probably not yeah i think everything's probably pretty much um 

159.47 161.09 A: [laughter] 

162.48 165.58 B: politically controlled [laughter] [cough] 

163.48 169.44 A: yeah so you know i hope that they get something in place for those people to be able to go work and whatnot 

168.98 172.74 B: oh my gosh i just can't imagine i wonder how many people 

172.96 178.05 B: would want would would wanna like emigrate somewhere else you know what i mean just yeah 

177.01 181.90 A: i was wondering that too because i'm wondering are we gonna get a lot of iraqi refugees moving to america 

181.22 184.96 B: see i don't yeah i wonder about that too because 

182.14 183.08 A: after this 

183.55 192.62 A: 'cause if you think about it like you've got a lot of vietnamese you know immigrants coming here after the vietnam war at least where i live in the part of the country where i live there's a lot of of vietnamese 

188.81 189.62 B: yeah 

192.45 196.61 B: yeah you're absolutely right they did and and that does make me wonder because 

196.65 210.59 B: again it goes back to you know well either a maybe some of the people [noise] who actually you know kinda followed saddam hussein because he was their leader and and really came to believe in him [mn] might be disgruntled and leave but then also the people who just fear 

210.75 224.84 B: what's next you know my my land is in an uproar everything i've known has just gone tipsy turvy and even though it may be ben- everybody feels it's gonna be beneficial for us i'm scared and i need to get the hell out of iraq you know [laughter] i mean [cough] i just 

215.54 216.52 A: mhm 

221.12 222.66 A: yeah i know 

222.95 233.20 A: i know or to see an opportunity because like you know who wouldn't want to live in america and it just wasn't an option i wouldn't think for iraqis to to emigrate here pretty much before because i don't suppose they would let them out 

232.95 237.37 B: yeah that's true that's true this may really open up the floodgates especially 

233.90 236.42 A: (( i mean i think they're defector )) 

237.38 251.06 B: um because it's you know we're still seen as the land of of capital and commercial opportunity and so if they just really wanna go make a living and have their religious freedoms and and this is this is the place to be you know 

243.13 244.02 A: mhm 

250.06 254.41 A: i know i would definitely want to [mn] an issue 

251.59 252.15 B: (( [cough] )) 

252.23 255.38 B: yeah if i didn't live here i would probably be trying to get here 

254.77 256.19 A: yeah i mean 

255.72 256.54 B: (( [mn] [cough] )) 

256.96 262.81 B: with the exception of maybe like sweden because they might be just about as good but in a different way but uh 

260.46 261.46 A: yeah 

262.91 265.87 A: but i mean i i think like i wonder what 

265.95 268.37 A: if you have an easier time emigrating 

268.57 272.21 A: to america because if your country's been in a war with us 

272.15 276.05 B: yeah i don't know i wonder that's a good that's a good question i don't know if 

275.57 276.69 A: because it's easier 

276.08 288.41 B: i._m._f. would be more flexible you know with with um you know incoming incoming citizens than they would normally if we hadn't just been a you know that's a really good that's a really good point gosh 

278.25 279.11 A: yeah 

288.47 289.89 A: i wondered about that 

289.29 297.65 B: yeah i don't know that would be interesting to research though to find out like you know i don't know if i'd look it up on the web or something but that is a really good question 

297.65 308.89 B: and do they and have they always had flexi programs like that where they're kind of like a little more lenient and open armed to to refugees than to just general [cough] immigrants or 

309.08 310.05 B: (( you know )) 

310.06 323.25 B: do they put special programs in place for those particular groups at the time that they know that you know people are gonna be coming [cough] people are gonna be fleeing their their homeland [noise] so that's a really good point 

318.27 318.88 A: (( mhm )) 

320.49 321.58 A: mhm 

323.19 324.87 A: (( yeah yeah i wondered about that )) 

323.87 325.30 B: i just don't know 

325.57 330.66 B: [noise] i kinda i i just you know i just feel for for those people because [sigh] 

331.09 346.07 B: like i said i know i know it's a good thing for them but it's such a huge change that it's just gotta be they've gotta be kind of shocked and stuff and [cough] to be handed all this freedom after they've been like under the thumb for so long it's just gotta be kinda like well 

335.91 336.94 A: yeah 

339.43 340.45 A: sure 

347.43 356.58 B: now what do i do [laughter] like what's the first thing i should do you know besides after we celebrate in the streets now what how do i get on with my life from here you know for those that are 

348.45 349.73 A: i know 

350.68 351.87 A: (( i know i know )) 

356.86 364.02 B: trying to decide whether to stay or leave iraq or for those that that just know that they wanna stay but just don't know what to do with themselves now [cough] 

363.16 365.70 A: (( mhm i know )) 

364.36 364.93 B: (( [noise] )) 

365.15 369.40 B: so that's that's really uh [noise] yeah [noise] 

366.87 368.07 A: really tough 

368.26 371.66 A: but i guess like time heals all wounds eventually you know 

371.95 374.61 A: and they will get regain some kind of stability 

374.86 379.51 A: after a while but it's hard to go through those type of periods where things really aren't 

375.69 377.05 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

379.91 380.90 A: stable 

381.42 384.64 A: i mean like i don't know how you live your daily life under those circumstances yeah 

381.58 382.69 B: hopefully 

384.21 386.47 B: yeah oh i just can't imagine 

386.47 400.53 B: i mean i suppose after as time goes by you get used to anything or if that's the like the way it's always been your whole life you know if it's somebody was you know just kinda born and grew up and is is sort of a young adult you know through saddam h- hussein's reg- regime then 

391.26 392.39 A: mhm 

397.11 398.15 A: mhm 

398.47 399.35 A: right 

400.69 405.12 B: i mean that's that's just the way you've always known it and you've never really known it any other way so you didn't i 

403.93 404.84 A: yeah 

405.65 410.32 B: mean you pro- probably could dream of different possibilities or hear of stories of different ways but 

410.92 418.02 B: yeah i mean it's just like well [laughter] it's always been this way now what you know or i can't wait to do this or 

413.33 414.73 A: [laughter] 

415.65 416.70 A: yeah 

418.03 419.11 A: mhm 

418.52 426.31 B: it's always just [cough] i wondered about the oil control though too it kind of like i said i think [cough] somebody having that much 

427.31 428.78 B: that much control 

429.05 432.08 B: over [cough] a product that is so 

432.33 436.05 B: globally needed especially by us the big dogs over here 

435.66 436.86 A: mhm 

436.44 437.03 B: (( [cough] )) 

437.61 439.32 B: i just don't know 

440.18 441.72 B: even if we 

442.14 451.13 B: install like our favorite pick for you know the the iraqi leader the new iraqi president even though we say it's gonna be an election or whatever or 

447.81 448.87 A: mhm 

451.07 458.29 B: if we just kind of suppose well if our government just hangs back a little bit and sees what the people do as far as picking someone [cough] 

456.11 457.12 A: mhm 

458.90 461.08 B: i mean i just 

461.33 471.93 B: i just don't know that you know in in ten or fifteen years that we're not gonna have some guy going up going i control the oil you know just you know just you know because absolute power just makes you go crazy and if you have 

467.58 468.64 A: yeah 

470.72 471.91 A: for sure 

471.78 483.55 B: that much control over something that other people want so badly sure you're just gonna start going a little muddy and want 'em to play let's play this power game and that power game and [cough] so i just 

477.51 478.48 A: (( i know i know )) 

482.06 487.86 A: well it's it's real weird to have so much of that resource just concentrated in one particular area of the world 

487.50 492.02 B: i think that's not a good thing [laughter] yeah [cough] 

488.01 498.52 A: that's an unstable one too yeah i know that's why i definitely you know when i eventually hopefully would buy another car i'd definitely get one of those hybrids so that just to use a little bit less you know 

498.20 503.97 B: oh i think those are cool yeah yeah i've seen the new honda one and i i really like that i think that's pretty cool 

499.43 500.90 A: yeah i mean i feel like 

503.32 508.26 A: yeah it's just not safe to be so dependent on something that we don't control really [laughter] 

506.73 511.29 B: [mn] see i think i've always thought that was so goofy too i mean there's just not 

511.15 526.10 B: i mean we've already milked all the oil out of our country or the the majority of it which i guess is i assume is why we started you know importing it so many years ago 'cause you know they've taken as much as they can out of alaska and and out of the you know the uh the southern continent in the u._s. and it's like well 

514.76 515.39 A: yeah 

521.40 522.51 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

526.11 532.60 B: there isn't a whole lot there we've kind of tapped all that we're gonna have to get it imported and it seems like the middle east is the only place 

532.64 534.30 A: well yeah i mean 

533.34 536.61 B: nobody else seems to have it [mn] like you said [cough] 

534.83 538.19 A: it's weird i know there's some in russia because 

539.04 545.07 A: i uh i i don't know who they're selling they they they need it for themselves or something because it's a big country russia 

544.47 546.96 B: that's true they are they are pretty large 

545.67 547.29 A: (( so they don't import so much )) 

547.31 548.11 A: yeah 

547.88 550.49 B: i wonder yeah it's just 

550.86 557.53 B: it seems like we should or could have by now tried to find another way 

557.86 559.01 A: yeah 

558.37 562.69 B: so that we weren't quite so dependent i mean i don't think we'll ever be able to eliminate 

562.64 564.11 A: yeah probably not 

562.83 565.36 B: some dependency on the middle east for oil 

564.97 565.84 A: mhm 

565.51 566.82 B: (( but )) 

567.10 570.40 B: i think we need to find other ways to supplement that [laughter] 

569.28 571.11 A: mhm [laughter] 

570.40 578.05 B: um i don't know if it's through you know manufacturing process if we can you know or alternative alternative energy alternative fuels 

576.74 577.73 A: mhm 

578.05 589.52 B: um or like you said you know maybe finding another region of the world who has a good oil supply and saying let's let's make a deal if you've got a little to spare we'll get some barrels from ya and [cough] so 

583.86 584.66 A: yeah 

587.19 588.65 A: mhm 

589.59 590.27 A: (( [mn] )) 

589.87 592.67 B: i just yeah i don't think it's a good idea that we 

593.02 599.95 B: we are so desperate for them and like you said it's such an un- even even a fight from iraq is just such a a place of unr-
