0.16 1.27 A: hi 

0.18 1.94 B: hi my name's nathan 

1.86 3.57 A: hey nathan this is jonathan 

3.41 5.16 B: hi jonathan so 

5.31 14.00 A: hi well i guess our topic is uh the arms uh or is is it arms inspections in iraq or is it disarmament at this point i guess 

11.38 12.53 B: (( well my )) 

13.48 16.45 B: yeah i think i guess that would be it 

15.84 19.21 A: yeah 'cause arms inspections that seems a little bit moot at this point 

19.57 21.93 A: uh well as far as the 

22.14 25.97 A: the uh c- continued disarmament obviously we're we're 

26.12 28.85 A: trying to find these weapons of mass destruction 

29.68 30.89 A: they're looking very 

29.71 34.05 B: yes i have some some thoughts that uh we won't find too much though 

33.99 34.95 A: yeah 

34.23 37.87 B: i think most of it's been uh ferried out of the country or been destroyed 

37.69 39.63 A: where do you think it's been ferried to 

39.20 42.67 B: ah syria and uh iran 

43.47 50.30 A: and do you think that there i mean has our intelligence uh why haven't we had any sort of 

51.02 56.18 A: further corroboration of this why why didn't we pick this up when it was happening 

56.21 57.20 B: um 

57.42 65.08 B: that i don't know i think we weren't we just missed something that we were just so focused on finding hussein himself 

64.77 65.67 A: right 

65.32 70.91 B: that the sort of like the ants ran out underneath while we were looking for the queen 

71.21 81.77 A: so as as far as with our surveillance the satellites all of the the sur- the surveillance of the the ground communications you think we still allowed that to happen though 

81.69 85.83 B: i i don't yes i do actually because um 

86.73 90.21 B: hey they they found a pipeline that no one knew about 

89.99 90.90 A: right 

90.45 93.32 B: and i mean hiding a pipeline 

93.36 94.81 B: that's pretty hard to do 

94.79 95.73 A: right 

95.58 97.46 B: so if 

97.51 101.77 B: in that kind of situation i mean especially knowing what i know about the 

102.06 105.73 B: uh the way oil is shipped through a pipeline 

105.52 106.34 A: (( mhm )) 

105.74 111.17 B: it wouldn't be hard to containerize something and run it through the same pipeline 

111.22 117.23 A: so they could've so that it didn't require any vehicles then it was something that could've been done just through that pipeline 

116.69 126.25 B: that's a possibility also with the amount of traffic that goes in and out of uh iraq because it had such porous borders 

125.12 126.98 A: (( mm right )) 

126.40 130.24 B: especially with syria and the amount of trucks bless you 

128.15 128.71 A: (( [cough] )) 

130.32 131.24 B: um 

130.40 131.18 A: thank you 

131.84 142.26 B: i i think that it's not hard to move small things like that 'cause how big does a does something like that need to be okay especially chemical weapons 

140.68 141.51 A: right 

142.03 146.01 A: right all the more i mean all the anthrax that they were talking about 

145.86 150.31 B: yeah but still they they um what was it they found uh 

150.61 152.56 B: before um 

152.76 154.44 B: when they showed how 

153.04 153.95 A: traced it 

154.67 159.06 B: even using a mobile laboratory that was in the back of an eighteen wheeler 

159.15 163.89 B: they could make enough anthrax to destroy [laughter] a a large area 

159.18 160.08 A: right 

163.22 170.68 A: yeah that's that was really disturbing do you think the iranians are do you think that they would've really dealt with the iranians in that way 

170.84 176.80 A: the the iraqi government do you think the i mean syria i could see that that's a possibility because 

178.23 181.13 A: [cough] but iran it still seems like there was a lot of 

181.19 183.69 A: [cough] antagonism between the two countries 

183.06 197.94 B: i i wouldn't say it's with the official iranian government but with um probably some sort of splinter group that's based in the area uh i don't wanna say al qaeda because i i you know 

186.78 187.57 A: uh-huh 

193.74 195.31 A: right one of the 

198.07 202.14 B: but something along that lines um some type of militants 

202.22 207.41 B: that are just camped out in in in the deserts 

206.88 208.58 A: right how do you 

207.55 210.36 B: even though i don't know if it's all desert and all that so 

209.50 210.33 A: right 

210.47 224.72 A: well i mean i think it obviously the you know we we've gotten rid of a regime that was rotten to the core and was probably one of the most brutal regimes of the twentieth century so i don't hopefully people are not shedding any tears but what is the 

225.34 234.82 A: the way for us to do this i mean if you look at what we've done i guess in other countries we still have troops in germany we still have troops in japan you know and that was 

234.79 244.85 B: well my yeah i i sort of feel that this whole bit is um american imperialism um but it's it's like the um the rise of the american empire 

234.97 236.69 A: almost sixty years ago 

245.54 248.90 B: uh being the only world superpower 

248.69 249.66 A: right 

249.18 252.32 B: and but we have a different way of 

252.35 265.59 B: empire building we we go in we take over we say it would be nice for you to be democratic we'll help you along those lines and then we generally we even let them be but sucking off the profits as best we can 

262.82 263.78 A: right 

265.77 273.29 A: yeah well i don't like i don't know how we're going to uh i guess there's one thing that was a little bit upsetting to a lot of people was 

273.41 287.76 A: the way that i guess halliburton and and bectel had these these contracts awarded to them and there was no and they were closed to the we really don't understand the way that the bidding process went and how these companies were chosen rather than others 

287.49 292.13 B: that and when i read in the paper that exxon mobil just had their 

292.26 296.57 B: best quarter ever and uh what was it ch- 

293.34 294.25 A: right 

295.14 297.76 A: and the british petroleum all of them did 

296.59 302.91 B: chevron texaco announced today record earnings and i look at what i'm paying at the gas pump and i'm going why you 

299.62 300.50 A: right 

302.75 303.69 A: yeah 

303.16 307.00 B: know these people are just raping us at least the one i'm looking at 

304.98 305.93 A: yeah 

306.80 309.03 A: it's true i mean it's it's 

309.08 321.68 A: i would think that you know it that's that's an old sort of i guess paranoid delusion that people say well you know at this point can't we have come up couldn't we have come up with some kind of an alternative to oil but it's like you 

321.74 329.63 A: know we went through the oil shocks of the seventies and then oil got very cheap in the eighties we went through the oil shocks of the original gulf war 

329.46 343.77 A: and oil was very cheap in the nineties and the economy went fine and then oil seems you know there seems to be obviously a might be oversimplifying but seems like the you know the the the the economy started to go soft here 

343.65 346.39 A: uh when oil prices started to go up again 

346.20 353.96 B: yeah well i am i work for a company that's that's very heavy an extremely heavy uh oil user 

353.62 354.53 A: uh-huh 

354.08 355.79 B: um i work for a railroad 

355.63 356.73 A: oh okay 

356.10 360.34 B: [laughter] and our stock price plummeted because 

360.52 364.70 B: our our oil or the cost of fuel went up twenty cents a gallon 

364.47 367.45 A: right and look what it's doing to the airlines too i mean 

366.65 371.97 B: yeah and twenty cents a gallon to us i mean a locomotive uses a lot of fuel 

371.71 373.30 A: yeah that's that's 

372.35 375.43 B: even though it still is cheaper than trucking 

374.82 385.28 A: right i mean it's [cough] what do they say it's for every penny that gasoline goes up in price it's a billion dollars out of other out of uh the economy for other things 

384.66 386.38 B: hm i didn't know that 

385.79 398.35 A: i i heard that somewhere it's uh it's pretty scary you know for every penny that you know that's a billion dollars less that are gonna be spent on other goods and services that would be a lot more productive probably for our economy 

397.96 403.42 B: yeah i mean especially considering most of the oil companies now are are based offshore 

399.18 399.93 A: (( you know )) 

403.00 403.94 A: sure 

403.71 408.77 B: uh i think only there's one or two of the majors left in the u._s. and everybody else is offshore 

408.66 410.60 A: yeah it's really and wh- 

410.45 419.09 A: but the problem is is okay now that we're gonna have the oil flowing again you know look at everybody i mean my car you know i'm as guilty as anybody my 

418.98 426.36 A: my i have an s._u._v. my i get less mileage now than i did probably fifteen years ago when i drove a a compact car 

425.76 429.74 B: yeah i'm in the same way i drive a s._u._v. too so 

429.13 431.86 A: yeah so we're all i mean we're all guilty of this 

430.40 434.41 B: but i guess i have a good excuse i live on a farm and i kinda need one [laughter] 

433.44 440.18 A: well yeah yeah i don't need one at all where i live there's no reason for it and i'm a lot of times the only passenger in it too 

439.46 450.20 B: well i am too and i have a long commute to work every day and it would make sense for me to buy a small car to drive back and forth to work and keep the truck on the farm but who wants to 

442.54 443.45 A: yeah 

446.84 447.73 A: right 

450.96 452.02 A: (( yeah i know )) 

451.03 452.24 B: and i guess 

451.84 454.98 A: that's the thing we don't you know we a lot of i guess 

454.95 468.84 A: there's some some sort of you know i'm as much of a hypocrite as anybody i complain about it and yet i'm wasting gasoline and so that's you know as long as we're gonna be wasting gasoline and it's it's demand driven it's almost like a dr- like drugs you know 

468.56 469.51 B: oh yes 

468.61 480.04 A: people don't demand them then then there's no getting there's not gonna be a a a need to supply them there's not gonna be the the the willingness to supply something for which there's no demand obviously doesn't exist 

479.76 482.73 B: no i the the um 

482.85 486.65 B: the big car companies are working on different approaches 

486.32 488.27 A: right the yeah 

486.66 490.76 B: and g._m. and b._m._w. have just agreed to 

490.84 495.21 B: a uh common method of uh for hydrogen delivery 

494.58 495.63 A: right 

495.33 497.82 B: which is which is a a major 

499.31 507.54 A: it's promising but you know i guess there's a couple even more immediately the the hybrids are already up and running and they work very well i mean a lot of these hybrids 

506.40 509.43 B: yeah and we're gonna see a lot more hybrids 

508.84 519.03 A: i hope so 'cause 'cause i know ford has reneged they were they were talking about increasing their fuel efficiency i think something like twenty five percent and they just downgraded that 

518.91 522.56 B: yeah we're gonna see a lot more um hybrids in especially in trucks 

522.27 523.22 A: yeah 

522.64 529.78 B: um a lot more mainstream vehicles are gonna be hybrid instead of odd looking honda insights and 

529.03 530.61 A: right right 

529.95 533.34 B: toyota previces and things like that 

532.74 537.26 A: yeah something that'll be a little more marketable to the the average driver 

536.78 537.76 B: right 

537.66 542.50 A: yeah it's or even you know these natural gas vehicles that are out there too 

542.44 544.74 B: the problem with that is the delivery 

542.54 543.52 A: i mean there's 

544.95 545.84 A: uh-huh 

545.39 552.17 B: the infrastructure's so in place for the oil industry um it's unbelievable the infrastructure that's in place 

547.91 548.95 A: right 

552.55 556.25 B: to deliver gasoline in this in this country 

555.56 556.55 A: sure 

556.60 561.41 B: and uh that's one thing they have to overcome with any other delivery system 

560.77 561.76 A: yeah 

561.56 570.71 B: and then hydrogen where are you gonna get the hydrogen from are you gonna take the hydrogen out of the petroleum or are you gonna use electricity to uh 

561.77 562.53 A: so 

566.36 568.00 A: exactly yeah that's 

571.45 574.27 B: uh crack water and take the hydrogen out of it [laughter] 

573.67 579.26 A: i think they say they're gonna use the the cheapest way to do it is using natural gas from what i recall 

579.53 588.74 A: which is something luckily that we have you know pretty substantial domestic supplies of so you know i guess we have enough in 

588.77 599.89 A: but it's amazing that you know the internal combustion engine there hasn't been any real improvement in that in the in the internal combustion engine in what you know we've been using the the same fundamental technology for over a hundred years now 

588.82 589.38 B: (( [noise] ))
