94.13 94.90 B: [laughter] 

98.06 103.55 B: i guess we're all done from what i understand but i think what they wanted us to do is sh- should we 

103.97 109.29 B: [sigh] i don't know are we supposed to subsidize them or what are we supposed to do with iraq now 

109.44 112.17 B: are we obligated to do anything i guess 

112.42 115.88 A: i mean i guess we sorta are 'cause we 

116.04 125.06 A: we wrecked it [laughter] and now you know our tax dollars are gonna go into rebuilding the the nation 

117.32 119.54 B: yeah we did [laughter] 

124.54 125.60 B: yeah 

125.09 129.80 A: and that's that's not cool either but [laughter] 

127.03 128.35 B: i i know 

128.90 131.38 B: it isn't really of course i didn't really well 

131.55 134.65 B: they had to do something about saddam but 

134.61 138.00 A: yeah i mean he's he's a cruel like uh 

138.20 150.87 A: dictator and all but i mean uh was it our responsibility [lipsmack] no i don't really think it was our responsibility the u._n. didn't didn't approve it and for a good reason 

139.48 140.62 B: yeah 

143.76 147.88 B: [sigh] hm i don't know i don't think so but i think 

148.77 153.81 B: no i think that we need to take care of people here before we take care of people overseas 

153.25 160.00 A: oh definitely but you know we don't have a pipeline that's untapped here [laughter] 

158.13 162.28 B: right oh absolutely i mean i'm not really against helping 'em 

162.72 164.29 B: you know if they need help 

162.76 171.00 A: yeah it's like yeah there there's other nations out there that are that are you know suffering and and and there's other nations with 

171.05 179.94 A: more of a nuclear weapon threat like you know north korea and stuff but yeah that's not our priority because you know they don't have oil reserves [laughter] 

174.69 175.48 B: (( yeah )) 

179.21 183.18 B: i guess that's what it all boils down to you know they've got assets [laughter] 

182.14 185.63 A: yeah and no matter how many times they say oh it's not about oil 

185.58 187.22 B: well yeah it is 

185.85 187.94 A: it is too about oil 

187.54 188.86 B: yeah it is 

188.95 195.36 B: i think you know how high i don't know how high gas is down there but it got up to a dollar eighty here 

193.15 194.36 A: well it got up 

194.72 199.73 A: yeah it's about a dollar seventy something here dollar eighty well yeah for regular unleaded it's like 

196.39 197.39 B: yeah 

200.29 203.13 A: (( a dollar yeah seventy or so )) 

202.50 208.04 B: yeah i mean like about a month ago it was really high and now it's down to a dollar sixty something 

208.42 212.36 B: now that that junk's all over with but junk you know but 

208.49 210.25 A: yeah 

212.07 219.96 A: but yeah i mean [mn] it's uh the gas thing that sucks but i heard it pretty much had that had nothing to do with like uh 

220.94 226.75 A: [sigh] it it it has nothing to do with the the war that was going on there was something else with uh 

226.68 239.39 A: trade relations and stuff another country i forgot someone was telling me but but then you think it's kinda like propaganda and stuff because then they'll get people pissed you know oh man we gotta get more more oil and more you know 

229.73 230.62 B: no 

235.18 236.44 B: mhm 

239.37 240.21 B: yeah 

239.54 242.31 A: petroleum and gas because you know 

242.56 248.15 A: 'cause of this war or whatever you know it gets people like yeah yeah it's a whole big game 

244.44 249.16 B: yeah it's a whole big game if you ask me it's just control an under control thing 

249.17 252.22 A: yeah it's all about money and whatever it's 

250.82 253.08 B: [noise] yeah i guess everything is isn't it 

253.31 256.70 A: (( yeah it really sucks but you know what are you gonna do )) 

254.87 255.76 B: i know it 

256.11 257.31 B: (( i don't know )) 

258.46 261.41 A: but um i mean [mn] [noise] 

258.54 259.19 B: [laughter] 

261.77 264.17 A: did we actually find saddam or no 

263.87 265.09 B: i don't think so 

264.74 269.25 A: well we could've and they they might not have said anything [laughter] who knows 

266.66 273.39 B: i yeah really i mean who knows is right i don't think they officially did but they probably did 

273.65 275.29 A: yeah i mean 

275.40 276.53 A: this 

275.54 276.65 B: i don't know 

277.48 280.66 A: (( this i don't know this situation's not )) 

279.71 282.07 B: he's got a lot of look-alikes too i guess 

282.07 288.01 A: yeah and he could've went into plastic surgery real quick anyway he could be walking in new york city right now 

282.27 283.41 B: seems like 

284.51 286.32 B: [laughter] 

287.38 288.67 B: who knows 

288.32 291.89 A: who knows but i mean uh [mn] 

292.85 296.40 A: i don't know [mn] the the way like the uh 

296.72 298.94 A: budget is for like uh 

298.97 302.51 A: education and stuff like that and and how they're making these tax 

300.60 301.57 B: mhm 

302.79 314.59 A: cuts for the rich like like i don't know whenever we fight a war in this country like you know it's on the backs of of the poor you know it's because we're taxed more overall and um you know 

309.84 310.58 B: yeah 

314.62 316.24 A: somehow always the uh 

316.51 327.90 A: rich end up getting a a bigger tax break they could fix all our problems by not giving a tax break to to the rich and you know if they just had an equal way of taxing people in this country which 

318.84 320.03 B: yeah always 

322.73 323.49 B: mhm 

327.03 328.82 B: yeah but there never 

327.91 338.56 A: then a lot of our problems would be solved financially but that's all it would take but they would never do that because they're the ones in control so why would they take money away from them 

333.97 335.05 B: that's right 

335.24 339.56 B: that's right so it wouldn't yeah they don't wanna do that they wanna you know 

339.46 341.30 A: they wanna like cut cut 

339.90 342.16 B: give themselves the upper hand there 

341.87 350.55 A: they wanna cut like after school programs and in school programs and [noise] about our school this our school's that but they're not you know 

345.10 345.93 B: (( yeah )) 

350.13 351.34 B: i know but there's 

350.57 353.45 A: they're saying whatever to get elected and then then say no 

352.26 355.26 B: yeah and then they do what they want basically 

353.92 367.86 A: yeah and then they get they get campaign funding from these big corporations and they say whatever and even they say whatever just to get [laughter] just to get elected and when it comes down to it they're they're obliged to the uh 

357.81 358.60 B: (( yeah )) 

364.55 365.33 B: yeah 

367.86 373.30 A: corporations who funded them money so they have to kinda do what they say or they're not getting any more money 

372.84 374.63 B: yeah really yeah 

373.92 376.05 A: that's that's that's kinda like 

376.44 379.82 A: (( that's kinda how it goes so it's like )) 

377.47 382.70 B: i agree you know it's not right but it's never been right and i don't think it ever will really 

383.14 384.08 B: (( you know )) 

383.21 384.13 A: yeah 

384.31 385.61 B: it just won't 

384.36 385.37 A: (( yeah )) 

385.88 391.14 B: but i i don't know about what we're supposed to do over there what's our obligation now that we blew 'em up 

390.68 393.39 A: (( i don't know i think that uh [noise] )) 

392.00 395.53 B: i mean yeah f- feed 'em that's okay 

396.11 399.89 A: yeah well what you know what happened throughout history is 

398.14 400.21 B: rebuild whatever they did 

399.94 407.65 A: what happened throughout history was uh you know like this has happened before and we've just come in 

405.27 405.98 B: sure 

407.78 412.84 A: you know took over well not taken over set up a democracy quote unquote [lipsmack] 

412.22 413.23 B: right 

412.98 414.91 A: you know which is us 

415.24 426.98 A: basically putting someone in power and not creating a democracy 'cause yeah we'll create a democracy but we're gonna fund the candidate we want such and such and millions and billions of dollars 

424.14 425.39 B: [laughter] yeah 

426.84 436.40 A: and no one else in that poor country will have the money to even compete or get their name out therefore whoever we want to run the country will and then we'll get a cut 

431.12 432.27 B: absolutely 

433.14 434.62 B: mhm will 

435.92 437.45 B: probably or 

436.64 442.75 A: of uh of the you know the oil proceeds and you know and everything will be uh 

438.54 440.24 B: some of the oil yeah 

442.63 443.85 B: the way it was 

443.89 445.04 A: yeah 

444.39 446.71 B: basically i mean maybe not 

446.87 450.11 B: to such an extreme hopefully but 

449.37 456.37 A: no no i mean i don't think that things will be the way it was in that country people won't be suffering and that'll be the justification of everything but 

450.65 451.49 B: yeah 

455.17 456.21 B: right 

456.68 460.46 A: we're gonna benefit financially we're gonna get a piece of the pie of course 

459.70 461.67 B: (( yeah yeah oh yeah )) 

460.56 466.87 A: and we're gonna we're gonna oversee everything and they're gonna be it's gonna be another u._s. government puppet abroad that's all it is 

466.49 468.37 B: yeah that's why that's right 

468.00 470.44 A: and and i think um 

471.49 474.35 A: just the way we are as a country just i mean 

474.73 484.58 A: people in general are always hungry for more like in our quality of life and what we need here in the states is is like or what we think we need is ridiculous you know the s._u._v. 

476.75 477.33 B: yeah 

484.36 490.64 A: everyone needs a s._u._v. now every company's making s._u._v. and you know it's all v. eight gas guzzling 

487.69 489.03 B: mhm 

489.82 491.15 B: (( yeah they are )) 

490.83 502.70 A: like whatever and it's just like you know we need more and more as we consume more and more so we're gonna need more and more oil and more and more gas and what's gonna happen when when all that crap is gone 

498.80 499.54 B: (( yeah )) 

499.60 500.36 B: (( yeah )) 

502.32 503.43 B: that's right 

503.53 504.52 B: then what 

504.19 508.05 A: well then i think we're probably just gonna move to electric cars like 

505.40 506.19 B: then 

506.55 509.38 B: oh yeah sure sure we will but 

508.08 519.82 A: that we have the technology and everything to have all the cars being electronic right now like you know what i mean like think about it what but doesn't right doesn't benefit the big business so 

513.82 517.33 B: oh yeah but it doesn't benefit the oil companies 

519.21 521.37 B: yeah so they are gonna 

520.04 526.21 A: until we run everything dry until it's not economical any more that's when we're gonna see the 

523.57 524.50 B: (( yeah )) 

525.84 527.31 B: yeah i think so 

526.24 532.59 A: changeover to electric you know we got they got those hybrid cars that honda i think it is i forgot what it is 

530.03 530.96 B: yeah 

531.24 536.07 B: um yeah i think so that they're part gas and part electric 

534.84 541.53 A: yeah but those cars are so they make 'em i don't know why they make 'em so ugly why can't they make it look a little nicer [laughter] 

536.16 537.25 B: but they 

538.49 539.55 B: yeah i know 

540.19 543.31 B: they don't have to be ugly to run [laughter] 

541.98 544.27 A: i know right it's crazy 

543.76 549.46 B: i know they really are ugly but i i don't know i've never seen one in person but [sigh] 

545.62 546.88 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

549.54 552.08 B: i don't know how how good they work actually 

552.14 556.58 A: (( yeah yeah but uh [sigh] [lipsmack] i don't know )) 

556.18 557.37 B: i don't either 

556.65 557.90 A: this whole 

558.94 562.24 A: [noise] this whole thing is just crazy 

560.54 561.43 B: yeah 

561.55 563.45 B: now how long are we supposed to talk 

563.07 566.76 A: uh ten minutes they said 

564.27 569.13 B: ten minutes oh is it did you hear a beep or something an interruption or what 

568.38 570.52 A: they'll probably just cut it off 

569.97 571.51 B: maybe i don't know 

572.08 573.84 B: i have no idea i haven't done this 

572.98 575.68 A: well it's been like what maybe like six minutes 

575.26 576.37 B: (( i don't know )) 

576.40 579.92 B: [laughter] i didn't pay attention wait my phone tells me let's see 

576.59 577.81 A: (( um [noise] )) 

583.03 585.31 B: eleven minutes and thirteen seconds 

585.76 588.76 A: really but that's probably been 

586.22 587.24 B: yeah 

587.81 590.03 B: probably from when the phone rang 

590.08 596.36 A: yeah and then you had yeah and then you had to wait for me to pr- probably pick up or whatever 

590.36 592.01 B: and i had to listen to the
