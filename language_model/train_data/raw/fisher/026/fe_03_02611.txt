9.86 16.77 B: hey could you help me i didn't um my hearing's not so good and i didn't hear even hear what the topic was 

16.60 20.93 A: oh the topic is arms inspections in iraq 

21.00 25.28 A: and if you think what you think the u._s. should do about it 

24.63 26.42 B: [laughter] okay 

26.09 27.53 A: [laughter] 

27.65 28.81 B: gee that's a 

27.69 28.91 A: um 

28.96 30.52 A: yeah that's a tough one 

31.45 36.32 A: um well i don't know i feel like i'm not a can you hear me okay 

35.93 37.65 B: yeah i hear you fine 

37.49 43.61 A: oh yeah i feel like i'm not as informed on the issue as i could be i have uh my own 

43.54 55.77 A: i guess personal opinions about it but i don't know [sigh] uh i don't really think i have all the facts very well so i i don't know uh basically i mean i've i've never been for the war [lipsmack] 

51.05 52.02 B: yeah 

56.14 59.00 A: and uh and i don't think that uh 

59.40 63.54 A: based on what i know that the the motives i agree with 

63.93 65.13 A: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

65.17 74.79 A: um but you know i feel like um obviously if there are weapons of mass destruction they they should be disarmed but we should go about it in a legal way 

75.68 76.71 B: uh-huh 

76.94 79.94 B: well i yeah i'm not um 

80.24 85.78 B: i wasn't really in favor of the war although i'm glad to see the way it went [laughter] 

85.00 86.74 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm [laughter] )) 

85.86 87.75 B: (( uh 'cause um )) 

87.87 93.41 B: i i like you said i don't have all the information i'm not over there but um 

93.17 94.19 A: right 

93.60 95.95 B: and i'm you know um 

96.20 97.26 B: the things [noise] 

98.96 101.58 B: uh the things that he was doing is 

101.92 105.03 B: uh not very good but uh so 

105.46 107.33 B: um if we should con- [noise] 

107.83 112.48 B: inspections i definitely think we should because um 

110.84 111.95 A: right 

112.56 118.24 B: uh the u._n. wants wants that you know basically the entire world wants 

118.71 125.46 B: you know to keep any more countries from getting more uh mass destruction weapons which 

125.55 133.27 B: i'm i'm definitely in favor of that i mean i i'd like to see peace everywhere [laughter] and and nobody um 

131.19 132.20 A: right 

133.25 145.88 B: um you know i i hope that you know within the next few years that things can change i i think the u._s. needs to take a whole different um approach 

145.88 153.28 B: to the situation i mean these people don't around some people around the world don't hate us for no reason at all 

146.17 147.22 A: (( definitely )) 

153.24 154.47 A: right 

153.41 159.96 B: and sure they some of them might get propaganda from the wrong people but at the same time um 

160.21 172.65 B: we're we're sitting over here rich and having a a great lifestyle and and it's because there's people around the world working for nothing and some people in prisons 

172.71 179.00 B: providing making stuff that we get really cheap then and then go buy it at you know 

179.00 183.71 A: right yeah definitely i think that you know it's 

179.87 181.43 B: and that's not right 

184.11 189.53 A: i i don't know i mean i think that if our motives are really to um you know 

189.49 195.60 A: liberate the people of iraq and to you know keep them um 

195.43 204.65 A: out of harm's way or saddam hussein or you know any [sigh] i feel like that's noble of us if that really was the only motive but i 

204.63 212.51 A: you know there's third world countries uh you know all over the world who have really harsh dictators who we support 

212.35 221.01 A: um and who we give weapons to and and you know it's like we support them when it's in our interest and we will fight them when it's in our interest 

212.91 214.47 B: exactly 

220.83 229.62 A: and here you know it was in our interest to disarm saddam hussein and i think it would be a lie to say that you know oil wasn't a big factor 

229.46 236.87 A: um and i think that we definitely need to you know invest a lot in rebuilding the country i mean they've been devastated by war 

236.97 249.38 A: for years you know and and had been abandoned and i think that we really we need to to help them in that sense and we also need to understand that if we are instituting a democratic government there 

249.15 260.55 A: that we have to accept that they don't really like us [laughter] and that you know if if they're going to have a democratic government that doesn't like us but it's the government that's going to allow them to 

260.60 269.05 A: be more free in expressing the fact that they don't and we need to accept that i mean you know it's like we have also done even though we've done a 

269.03 277.37 A: a supposedly good thing here and i think that we have in some sense even though we've also caused a lot of damage um i think that you know 

274.77 275.62 B: yeah 

277.30 289.03 A: we've done so many bad things in the past that you know it just can't be forgotten that um [lipsmack] that there's a reason why you know that the people don't like us and and i really don't know um 

283.44 285.33 B: yeah yeah 

288.97 295.88 A: the the weapons of of mass destruction that they that [laughter] they have over there um i feel like there is a legal 

295.71 304.02 A: way i mean the you know the united nations has a process for this that i think we sort of abandoned [laughter] and that 

302.77 316.84 B: yeah but they were they weren't cooperating with the u._n. and the u._n. wasn't really standing behind what they said that they had to do and uh but you know we're the ones that put saddam hussein in hussein in power to begin with 

308.57 309.60 A: right 

316.55 318.30 A: right [laughter] 

317.24 319.52 B: uh and um 

320.07 321.52 B: you know i think 

321.77 323.33 B: we can um 

323.86 332.88 B: you know win over the world a lot better by example than by uh and you know you never can really achie- achieve peace by war 

327.43 328.57 A: right 

332.76 334.37 A: right definitely 

333.02 336.63 B: because the underlying causes are still there 

336.68 337.67 B: you know 

336.79 337.61 A: (( and i )) 

337.47 343.16 A: yeah i agree and i think that um you know what a lot of people are concerned about is you know that 

343.02 345.45 A: president bush and the media has 

344.24 345.36 B: [laughter] 

345.28 356.66 A: instilled sort of a fear in people of of terrorism that you know they need to do this in order to protect us and the whole rest of the world but i mean i think this is also going to cause a lot of 

354.29 355.76 B: (( [noise] )) 

356.50 366.58 A: lot more anger in potential terrorists and i don't really think it's going to keep us safe from future terrorist attacks or you know other countries i think that 

366.56 373.95 A: really the only thing that um will will help us i think is the u._s. not being this superpower house of needing to 

373.95 382.29 A: you know be the ones who fix everything and you know ha- they have to have a hand in in every country um you know i think in some 

382.24 393.11 A: in some instances we can just pull out you know like i think that we should pull out of uh our interests you know in israel and and palestine but i know we will will never do that so [laughter] 

393.51 407.94 A: too much money involved and there's i mean i think there's just a lot that we don't know because i i don't think that the media is very um [lipsmack] i don't think that they're very accurate in everything that they've put out and i think it's pretty one sided [laughter] 

405.31 406.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

408.76 409.75 A: but 

409.81 410.90 A: are you still there 

411.30 412.97 B: yes i'm still here 

412.33 423.19 A: oh okay [laughter] um but i i don't know if we should stick on the topic of disarmament as far as that goes i really i don't know i don't know the right way to go about it you know i think um 

423.31 429.66 A: force uh is what we've done and i i don't think we can really back out of that now 

429.97 432.89 A: um you know i think whatever 

433.17 440.68 A: whatever they have but at the same time i don't really understand how you know it's it's okay that we have whatever weapons we you know 

440.75 446.05 A: need to protect ourselves and that you know we're uncomfortable with other countries having the same thing it's 

446.23 447.54 A: it's a little 

447.80 450.05 A: you know disconcerting [laughter] 

450.19 451.31 B: yeah 

451.29 452.63 A: but 

452.90 454.01 A: (( um )) 

454.03 455.09 A: well i 

455.27 460.95 A: not not to get off topic here have you done this um this fisher thing before

516.91 518.51 A: well yeah 

522.14 524.54 A: (( yeah it seems like it's been a long time )) 

523.46 526.23 B: well actually no it hasn't been that long that's how long 

526.40 528.05 B: since i called in

529.92 531.58 B: anyway so 

530.73 534.15 A: well yeah i i think that um 

533.35 537.86 B: but yeah we need to keep doing inspections over there um 

537.02 538.06 A: right 

538.02 546.99 B: 'cause um i you know i they did you know [laughter] i mean they gassed their own people back a while back you know 

546.86 548.01 A: right 

547.79 549.47 B: and um 

549.50 552.45 A: yeah it's i mean i i definitely don't think that 

552.39 560.08 A: but i mean i'm not a supporter at all but i and i i'm not a saddam hussein supporter either i think that he's you know a very bad person but 

559.96 568.70 A: at the same time you know like you said i mean we supported him in the past um and even when he did worse things than than this 

568.18 569.23 B: yeah 

568.61 577.02 A: um you know we supported him all the way through his worst atrocities and because it was in our interests at the time and i think you're right i mean we definitely 

577.07 582.20 A: um need to set an example by not you know in the future 

582.26 583.18 A: (( supporting )) 

583.19 588.21 A: dictators like that and then later when we realize the mistake we've made you know 

588.22 599.89 A: go back and and annihilate them i think it's best just not to support them in the first place [laughter] and uh you know i think we also need to to work a lot on our diplomacy with other countries um 

593.28 594.52 B: yeah
