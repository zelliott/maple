74.36 77.20 A: with the country but i'm just like 

77.74 81.56 A: i i don't know i don't feel that's a valid enough reason to 

81.84 87.98 A: you know like go to war and then like kill so many people and lose so many american lives as well 

88.26 91.75 A: um sometimes i just think it's um 

92.15 96.34 A: what is it like it's a it's a front for 

96.49 109.12 A: uh what his real agenda is you know and i don't think it's real like even if i mean 'cause we have nuclear arms ourselves so what's i mean why can't iraq have arms too you know so 

109.87 110.99 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

110.87 112.76 B: yeah i know what you mean 

113.77 114.94 A: um 

115.02 117.73 A: i kinda think yes i'm like really against 

117.85 127.82 A: the war pretty much um yeah 'cause now i mean now that we've toppled iraq i think we're trying to go into other countries too for like the same reason 

127.94 128.94 A: like 

129.00 133.65 A: and i don't know i just yeah i don't agree with the whole thing 

133.30 135.26 B: [noise] i don't agree with it either 

135.23 136.62 A: yeah 

136.26 139.92 B: have you heard about the two children that were hurt badly 

139.97 142.48 A: no i didn't what happened [noise] [mn] 

142.64 144.32 B: there were two children in 

144.39 145.75 B: (( iraq )) 

146.61 147.46 B: (( one li- )) 

147.48 153.65 B: one male one little boy and one little girl and the little boy 

154.07 155.10 B: he was 

155.48 162.67 B: they didn't answer because they didn't know eng- they didn't know english and they fired at the children 

162.76 164.90 A: (( oh wow )) 

165.29 169.38 A: that's horrible where did you did they put this on the news where did you hear about this 

169.66 172.57 B: (( i heard about it in denning new mexico )) 

172.75 173.53 B: (( on )) 

175.18 176.50 B: (( on the denning )) 

177.29 178.49 B: (( newscast )) 

178.97 180.55 A: (( oh okay )) 

180.82 182.32 A: (( at the news at ten )) 

182.44 185.46 A: (( yeah see that's the thing like i don't think )) 

185.60 195.32 A: i don't look i didn't hear about that and i think people the american public needs to know more about stuff like that like 'cause i don't think a lot of people like who support the war realize 

195.35 201.03 A: you know some of the horrors and stuff like children being killed that's going on 

201.05 206.07 A: you know and that's another problem i have with it like the media doesn't really cover it 

206.28 213.40 A: at that well or they're covering it so that um people will just rally behind the president and stuff and 

213.61 215.67 A: yeah that really um 

215.97 218.85 A: yeah that really makes me mad that's so sad 

219.45 220.49 A: (( um )) 

220.23 222.36 B: oh really 

221.77 222.99 A: (( [laughter] )) 

222.75 226.09 B: it makes me mad too i mean they should 

226.21 231.70 B: i mean like they should respect the children i mean they're just children they 

231.80 234.51 B: they don't even know what war is 

233.81 235.70 A: yeah 

235.74 237.70 A: i know that's just 

237.68 251.98 A: yeah like and i don't think like if people 'cause 'cause i think the u._s. is different because we haven't had a war on our like soil like in our country you know since like the revolutionary war or the civil war which was like 

251.93 254.50 A: generations and centuries ago 

254.42 268.55 A: and um i don't think a lot of people realize that when we go to war like it's really traumat- not even like even if you don't kill people like it's traumatizing to people because i mean can you imagine like looking out your window and seeing tanks 

268.47 280.32 A: rolling by and like hearing gunshots and bombs outside and you know like so i i think people would be less inclined to go to war if they realized just uh how 

280.18 286.03 A: detrimental it is you know like 'cause we've just never had to experience that and i think that's 

286.25 288.07 A: (( a problem as well )) 

289.07 292.10 A: yeah it's really the whole thing is really sad 

292.10 293.69 B: [noise] oh really 

293.42 294.92 A: yeah 

295.38 298.75 B: [sigh] well the children aren't dead but they're

303.25 307.07 B: if his leg doesn't get better they may have to amputate it 

306.44 309.22 A: oh do you know how old the children were 

309.60 314.85 B: [noise] the little boy was seven and the little girl was only six [noise] 

314.62 316.26 A: wow 

317.57 320.51 B: that made me so angry when they did that
