38.32 50.41 B: it's all about the oil and i'm like against the war because what they're doing in there is [noise] they're talking about weapons of mass destruction and they sh- they couldn't even come up with any weapons of mass destruction 

38.59 39.28 A: uh-huh

50.47 62.69 B: you know and it's all about the oil about bush going in you know destroy the country fight have a war and then say i'm sorry you know what let's help you and let's clean up and then they're gonna put the pipeline through their country to get the oil 

50.50 51.28 A: (( uh-huh )) 

62.02 75.03 A: yeah no i agree i think it's like it's definitely a financial thing there's a a lot of other countries are very war torn and a lot of like bad leaders in the countries and yet we're not doing anything about it like north korea has definitely like 

72.54 73.31 B: [noise] 

74.81 87.06 A: posed like a nuclear threat like has the u._s. gone in there and done anything because it's like there's nothing for us to to get in a way to take advantage of i know that sounds bad but you know i guess 

76.92 77.96 B: yeah 

85.89 87.40 B: that's true yeah 

87.32 97.99 A: i mean i agree it's like i agree with you how like ku- like in iraq like if they didn't have oil there we most likely wouldn't be there it wouldn't be a concern 

96.29 97.35 B: it's a beau- 

97.88 99.81 B: yeah i'm sorry yeah [noise] it's 

99.54 100.43 A: so 

99.99 104.84 B: a beautiful country a beautiful country and look what they did so far to it 

104.91 118.18 A: yeah i mean i agree like that you know we have to intervene in that like there are inhumane things going on there and that as human beings we can't let people suffer but it's like 

109.17 110.30 B: (( [noise] )) 

111.88 112.62 B: (( mhm )) 

118.12 123.56 A: how do we pick and choose battles and like how do we like suddenly go from afghanis- 

123.44 135.15 A: afghanistan to like osama bin laden to suddenly like well saddam is suddenly a threat but we knew that like we knew that from long like years and years ago and so forth so 

128.88 130.25 B: yeah i know 

134.95 143.06 B: [laughter] well i'll tell you this you know bas- you mentioned about korea korea has weapons of mass destruction do you see them going over there 

141.44 142.63 A: exactly 

142.98 154.85 A: yeah i mean it's crazy like it was in like it's in the newspapers it's definitely in the media and like they declare that they have nuclear weapons and they're well willing and ready to use them at any time and it's just like 

150.61 151.45 B: [noise] 

154.77 159.03 A: are we doing anything about them and it just seems like a very slow process how we're 

159.00 171.63 A: so concerned about this iraq business and it's because we have there's oil there and we know that we can sort of exploit that and like we decided to go in without the u._n. and we decided that you know like 

161.61 162.28 B: mm 

169.40 170.51 B: yeah 

171.78 184.65 A: therefore we have control of what we can do to this country and how we wanna set it up and whether you know and it's it's hard because we're a very different we're a very westernized country and the country there 

184.49 190.02 A: part of them want our assistance but a lot of people don't want our assistance and 

189.38 190.21 B: (( mm )) 

190.85 191.92 A: so 

192.32 198.90 B: well i'll give you the example um my husband emailed me a picture of this girl who just got killed by a bomb 

200.53 202.56 B: killed over this whole war 

202.37 203.17 A: uh-huh 

202.71 207.22 B: her leg was ma- mangled her actually her foot was hanging off and her head was like 

207.35 211.12 B: like it was blown you know half way off it was just 

210.39 211.42 A: mhm 

211.30 220.38 B: sad you know you see all these innocent people but a lot of people who are not aware what's going on what bush is all about he's a he has money in oil 

220.31 221.38 A: yeah 

220.67 235.04 B: he has money in oil and he's sending these people out there to first of all he's sending the troops out there on what they what they think he's right so they go in there pumped up and like war we're gonna fight and they don't even know what he's doing over there you know 

234.22 237.89 A: and true and it's like i mean i was reading an article on how like 

237.89 247.22 A: all i mean it's it definitely shows that we care about oil 'cause we have guards standing around the oil you know like the refineries and so forth yet like we have no one guarding 

247.12 253.60 A: the like library and then the museum which like the people the iraq people looted themselves and it's like 

252.86 254.45 B: oh yes 

253.81 258.70 A: and it now is so sad because it's like it's part of our history just part of human history and like 

258.03 260.19 B: they destroyed their history 

259.89 260.90 A: exactly 

260.99 274.64 A: that happened and then donald rumsfeld was saying like well boys will be boys and like that's what happens when people don't have freedom and suddenly have this freedom and that's total b._s. because we like i was reading another article on how 

266.18 267.12 B: oh 

268.46 269.43 B: yeah 

274.68 287.18 A: there was consultants that told the military the top twenty things to protect and like the library which had the basic human writing and the history of just humankind 

287.04 293.10 A: they at the museum they were told to protect and that was like number two and number three and they didn't choose to do that 

292.89 305.92 A: and it's not like and it's not like the u._s. are lacking of troops they're protecting different interests and that have more immediate monetary value not and it shows like americans with our brief history of like two hundred years 

293.07 294.20 B: oh yeah 

305.99 317.45 A: we you know it's like what we're concerned with is like money what's important now versus what was important in history and of mankind and i think it's very sad and how 

315.00 316.01 B: oh yeah 

317.44 327.86 A: you know i'm sure other people view us it's like this imperialistic [noise] power going in and doing what we want because we can and i mean it's good that we're 

327.87 331.40 A: alleviating suffering but it's like at what cost 

331.09 341.64 B: yeah at the cost of innocent people men women children who are getting killed you know over what what is it and they can never explain all they can say is we need to 

342.01 345.02 B: kill him you know um we need to take 

343.29 344.23 A: mhm 

346.78 347.93 B: mass destruct 

348.27 348.98 B: (( you )) 

349.06 350.01 A: yeah 

349.47 350.19 B: know 

350.44 351.67 A: yeah 

351.05 358.78 B: they just oh they the the country before they even went in it was it's a beautiful country and they just messed it up they mess up the people 

359.61 361.04 A: yeah 

360.87 362.52 B: homeless they have 

363.83 365.02 B: (( destroying their )) 

364.85 365.57 A: [noise] 

367.44 368.35 A: uh-huh 

370.18 378.76 B: they wanna go in just like going to the the museums or offices everything just like destroy every- everything just because bush with his 

378.41 379.61 A: [noise] 

380.60 391.75 A: yeah and then the but i also think like like as humankind that you'd think we'd progressed very far in that we don't fight we can at least have some type of 

391.89 394.29 A: diplomacy conversation where we can 

394.22 406.47 A: solve the problems yet like we still have to resort to very animalistic behavior where we have to fight and kill and that sort of results in like it's just this constant power struggle and 

406.40 409.64 A: that i don't know i think it's just it's very sad like 

409.99 416.89 A: i don't know how far we've progressed in like thousands of years as mankind like we still kill to get what we want 

416.94 426.76 A: and so i don't know i just think it's like we're supposed to be this intellectual power yet we're not really because we still resort to like basic 

426.82 436.65 A: animalistic instincts i mean i have friends that argue differently it's like well you know you fight to get power and you do it whatever means war is a consequence of that so 

436.75 437.75 A: (( i don't know )) 

442.63 443.95 A: (( [noise] hello )) 

448.31 451.79 A: [noise] i'm doing this survey it's ten dollars for ten minutes of conversation
