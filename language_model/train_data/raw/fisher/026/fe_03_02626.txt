7.65 9.83 B: i'm here in southern california 

9.38 10.55 A: (( oh )) 

10.71 14.52 A: i did not even hear the question it was did you 

14.41 18.08 B: it's about disarming iraq ah wh- how you feel about that 

15.87 16.88 A: (( oh ok- oh )) 

17.01 24.07 A: okay it she said so quick i was like what i what iraq oh i'm not very political how about you 

21.11 22.17 B: yeah 

24.05 30.24 B: oh somewhat but um i think that you know it's kind of a past tense question but i guess we did the right thing 

28.53 29.72 A: yeah 

30.32 34.10 B: you know i mean it's something that's sort of after the fact [mn] ah 

31.45 32.16 A: (( [mn] )) 

33.53 42.11 A: right absolutely so you think they just had this one going and then things calmed down and ended and they still got the the same question going 

42.18 49.27 B: yeah perhaps that's the case i mean now it's less of a political question than than an academic one whether or not we did the right thing 

48.92 50.13 A: uh-huh 

49.99 54.90 B: and it seems like that there's been i guess that there was a reasonably good job done 

55.19 60.50 A: yeah [laughter] from what i could tell it looked really good 

57.45 58.01 B: (( [mn] )) 

60.77 65.62 B: yeah it looks like that ah the people there are doing somewhat better although there's quite a bit of anarchy 

66.05 76.01 A: mhm you know i haven't seen the news in the last few days and the last time i really watched was when they were desecrating the museum and it was just so upsetting 

75.99 84.70 A: and that was that was pretty much the last time which was probably like two weeks ago even that i really focused on what was happening 

76.29 78.05 B: well that was too bad 

84.76 86.36 A: currently there 

86.16 87.11 B: mhm 

86.64 90.07 A: um so what what do you know is going on now 

89.98 97.27 B: [sigh] um i guess they're trying to restore order but just just you know at the l- local leadership level there's just a lot of um 

97.29 104.48 B: issues and problems like there's there's a shiite faction you know and and and and they were worried they were going to become like iran 

104.71 108.86 A: what um what's the jihad factor what's that 

105.14 106.60 B: americans 

108.03 112.28 B: the shiite the ah i guess there's two kinds of muslims 

111.64 112.57 A: okay 

112.54 118.81 B: there's the ones that hussein was the sunnis and then there's the shiites which are the kind like iran 

115.83 116.88 A: okay 

119.45 120.92 B: but um 

121.19 123.99 B: they're worried it could become like another religious or 

124.09 128.85 B: uprising and that they'd have to worry about this whole new kind of regime you know 

127.67 129.73 A: oh brother 

130.18 131.10 A: (( oh my )) 

130.32 132.26 B: i hope not you know 

131.30 145.62 A: oh my god it's like enough already why would that happen because they feel like they need to assert their identity and not like be taken o- [mn] influenced by us or why would that even happen 

145.79 155.38 B: i guess because th- they want to be [mn] you know they want to be- you know they want to believe in their god right and it's it's part of their culture and they don't someone else to tell them what to do 

150.36 151.53 A: uh-huh 

154.80 156.48 A: yeah 

155.94 158.24 B: it sure seems that way doesn't it 

157.62 160.88 A: yeah that would make sense 

161.70 165.29 B: um is this have you done any surveys before or 

164.21 166.14 A: no i've never done one have you 

165.98 169.23 B: no i just that's why i just called in did you call in too 

168.48 170.05 A: i just called in 

169.89 177.96 A: and i was surprised at how quick everything was happening and all of a sudden you were on the line i didn't know it was going to be we were going to discuss the whole 

177.87 188.36 A: thing [laughter] i just figured it'd be like an automated thing asking me questions and yeah this is actually kind of fun i like that [laughter] do you do surveys 

186.22 187.56 B: it's interesting 

188.51 192.90 B: oh yeah i just went to an auto survey yesterday where they ah do greenfield online 

193.02 198.19 B: and they sent me to auto survey where you get a hundred dollars for looking at cars that for about three hours 

197.59 200.53 A: ah well i do mystery shopping 

200.21 201.37 B: i do too 

200.88 204.18 A: yeah i love it it's so fun 

204.27 206.77 B: i understand you can make a good living doing it 

204.41 205.14 A: i 

206.08 217.95 A: you know i'm starting to kind of gather up a lot of them i work four days a week and i just seem to fill up my spare time doing them but um 

218.79 221.05 A: what's the what's the 

221.19 228.26 A: auto shopping thing do you thi- do you think they're like taping our conversation and we're supposed to stay on our topic [laughter] 

223.35 224.39 B: oh that was just 

227.97 231.89 B: [mn] i guess so so i could go back [laughter] um [mn] 

230.24 234.87 A: okay [laughter] you're going to have to do most of the educating in this one 

234.26 236.52 B: oh no um i think that 

235.24 236.47 A: [laughter] 

236.58 240.36 B: [sigh] it's just interesting though the po- politics of what's going on 

240.37 241.65 A: mhm 

240.59 242.66 B: you know um 

243.11 249.98 B: [mn] i guess it's going to be an election year next year so it was kind of a political football for for bush 

249.78 251.25 A: uh-huh 

250.90 255.84 B: it had to go well for him or otherwise he'd be in deep deep weeds you know 

255.45 257.84 A: yeah that's a good point 

257.87 259.15 B: (( and it looks )) 

258.04 263.57 A: and so what do you think 'cause it's going to be an election year how's that going to influence things 

262.94 269.61 B: well it might help him escape the criticism he'll certainly receive if the economy doesn't get better soon 

269.63 270.89 A: (( uh-huh )) 

270.89 283.61 B: [mn] but i guess right now he looks like he's played his cards pretty well but i i think that this was a you know regardless of that i think that i think that i hope that there's more security now than there was before 

284.02 285.86 A: in in america 

284.34 285.37 B: (( you know )) 

285.84 287.25 B: yeah 

286.59 287.71 A: uh-huh 

287.78 290.17 B: i hope that that that we're in the

309.76 310.80 A: but 

309.97 314.43 B: it's like the black um middle upper middle class now 

313.90 317.20 A: yeah it wasn't like that 

316.98 319.58 B: what was it what was it like when you were there 

318.72 328.17 A: it was all white and i don't know i'm you know based on me walking myself to school to kindergarten i remember 

327.96 336.11 A: getting lost one day and it was only a few blocks away it was just really safe and really community 

336.46 343.13 B: yeah but it's funny it's funny there's you know there's even oil wells up little ones little oil derricks on the side but 

340.38 341.48 A: yeah 

341.78 355.69 A: i don't remember oil wells [mn] i went back there recently and i just saw a lot of bars on windows and i knocked on a couple of doors and people were still the people we grow up with still lived there we couldn't believe it but it was a little bit scary 

346.97 348.21 B: (( oh )) 

356.11 359.58 A: doing that and um i lived in three different houses there 

359.68 361.09 B: oh

373.77 375.13 B: but um 

376.07 381.57 B: [mn] this is an interesting sort of thing i i i just found out about it today too looking at the mystery shopping thing 

381.12 394.80 A: yeah i i they called me three times i missed them so i figured oh yeah though that's right so i'll call in it seems to happen pretty quick don't you think like i wasn't really ready i wasn't really paying attention did you miss something 

393.38 394.36 B: i 

395.57 402.91 B: no i i i'm using my cell because you know it's it's a weekend so it's it's it's easy it's actually 

401.17 404.15 A: oh re- already it's the weekend 

403.61 408.99 B: oh actually you know i have a lot of mi- minutes i forgot 'cause i was off today but it's okay i have a lot of minutes 

407.32 409.57 A: (( oh you have lots of weekend )) 

409.33 422.62 B: i'm sorry i have a lot of minutes left i work i work in um with the government but i had the day off 'cause i'm going out for some training so this is a good day to talk politics and it's starting to rain here 

410.21 411.63 A: (( what do you do oh )) 

414.97 416.09 A: okay 

418.70 419.73 A: oh 

421.95 428.14 A: oh it's pouring here not at the moment but i took my dogs for a walk and i got caught in a downpour 

427.99 430.29 B: oh that was too that's too bad 

430.07 431.80 A: so let's see 

432.13 436.57 A: wh- how do i feel about iraq it's really 

434.76 435.33 B: (( [sigh] )) 

436.09 440.52 B: they should have asked how do we feel about syria or what's going on beyond this you know 

439.62 443.78 A: oh my god i wouldn't have known that even less [laughter] 

443.34 446.12 B: but but it's interesting topic 

446.87 453.26 B: i guess there's a lot of different opinions you have the dixie chicks you have everyone weighing in on this 

453.02 454.96 A: yeah 

455.41 457.67 A: (( um hm )) 

457.46 462.85 B: you had you had you had people from that were very much against and people that thought we should do more 

462.16 467.47 A: oh my god all the protesting that was really i think painful to watch that 

467.36 468.54 B: yeah 

467.87 480.04 A: you know i mean yeah i don't want people to die and eighteen year old kids now that i'm older look so young and they just look so innocent and that broke my heart 

479.88 492.41 A: but that's what we stand for we stand for like protecting ourselves and other people so i didn't really understand why people were so against it i felt it was misdirected 

492.24 498.15 B: i think so too because again the privilege to be free [mn] a lot of it comes from 

495.28 496.89 A: yeah 

498.78 502.05 B: you know having to be strong and defend oneself 

501.11 503.74 A: right like not being free for the moment 

503.57 517.81 A: but it's like we i think we stand for the higher good of our men and i like that about us and you know what else is there in life except for really fighting for what you believe and i think that goes [mn] to all 

503.67 504.65 B: mhm 

517.61 519.16 A: subjects 

519.09 521.06 B: i think definitely so 

521.95 523.05 B: um 

523.92 529.64 B: and and it- it's a tough it's a tough decision to go to war to do something but 

529.71 541.41 A: yeah it was really scary the couple of days before and then wasn't it kind of strange how we were going to go to war at five o'clock that wednesday that was weird like i didn't know you picked a time to go to war [mn] 

538.20 538.98 B: well 

541.04 544.91 B: i didn't know either it it that shock and awe and all that stuff 

544.43 545.32 A: yeah 

546.16 547.07 A: yeah 

547.73 551.63 B: [mn] so is this the university of pennsylvania is that what this thing is 

551.63 556.36 A: i don't know let's see i'm looking at it you can participate in up to three calls 

556.45 558.15 A: each successful call 

558.29 564.57 A: re- recorded will give you a virtual lottery ticket in our lottery and you will receive ten dollars per call 

564.66 566.90 A: (( we have developed blah blah blah )) 

567.71 568.90 A: (( mm hm hm )) 

569.57 579.51 A: um we also hope the following information will be used along with recorded telephone calls in language related research country born and then that did you fill out a thing online 

579.65 585.40 B: um i ah think it was a brief brief sort of thing on where i was born what you know a cou- 

584.41 585.92 A: yeah 

585.51 587.88 B: a few demographic questions 

586.95 595.92 A: yeah they're going to use that so i wonder if they put us together at all i don't think it felt pretty random we're going to look for another caller okay we got one [laughter] 

595.49 599.95 B: and i'm not sure about the s. i didn't put my s._s._n. in i'm a little leery about that but i don't think they need
