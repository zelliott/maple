18.85 21.91 B: ah i'm i mean i'm in concord in the east bay 

21.76 24.90 A: oh okay my roommate in th- um college was from there 

24.95 26.77 B: yeah it's a good place 

25.71 26.70 A: yeah 

26.75 29.41 A: okay uh what's your favorite holiday 

29.59 31.54 B: i like thanksgiving 

31.56 33.45 A: oh okay why is that 

33.56 35.03 B: i um 

35.20 39.99 B: for example like christmas is is a good holiday i can't 

39.94 42.01 B: i don't have anything against christmas 

41.78 56.49 B: but in fact there is a lot of pressure cos you gotta do all the shopping beforehand and then there's the pressure of you know if i buy uncle bill a present will uncle bill like the present and then after you get all your presents if you don't like them at least 

46.04 47.12 A: yeah 

51.96 53.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

56.29 64.37 B: what i do is i return the ones i don't like so then you have to deal with all that and it's almost as much hassle as it is fun 

64.48 65.58 A: yeah the 

64.63 65.66 B: where whe- 

65.72 70.68 B: where as for me thanksgiving it's just kind of like uh you know you go 

71.01 74.41 B: and i guess in my family it's not very good 'cause 

74.74 79.54 B: my mother does all the cooking so all i do is i just show up eat 

79.58 87.13 B: you know help her clean up and then leave so it's like i don't have much of the work to do but i get to do all of the eating plus i like turkey 

82.01 83.04 A: yeah 

87.26 89.00 A: yeah definitely 

89.05 91.06 B: wh- what's your favorite holiday 

90.83 104.86 A: um halloween [noise] um i just kinda i never really dress up but i just really enjoy seeing other people dress up but mostly i just like seeing the kids and it kinda the last couple of years there hasn't really been as many trick or treaters 

105.13 108.28 A: since september eleven which ki- you know i don't like it 'cause 

108.56 119.27 A: you know we bought all this candy hoping that you know that first um october [noise] in two thousand and one there would be a lot of kids but there wasn't any 'cause most people just kept their kids at home or had small parties 

118.14 119.94 B: mhm mhm 

119.32 130.28 A: so that kind of makes me sad but i don't know it just makes me happy to see all the the kids really happy and the the kids can't go to school in costumes anymore either in l. a. 

121.89 123.01 B: mhm 

130.05 131.19 B: you're kidding 

131.06 139.00 A: no because um well they have to wear uniforms all the time so that i think for halloween they get to have a free dress day as opposed to costumes 

138.66 143.44 B: so so like on halloween they just get to dress up like they in their normal street clothes 

142.94 154.87 A: yeah exactly but i don't know it's still it's still pretty cool though like you know i'm hoping that this year i'll probably go to san diego where my family is and hang out with the kids in my family and watch them 

155.04 156.26 A: get dressed up 

156.73 159.13 B: you know what happened um 

159.89 162.40 B: basically where i am 

162.29 172.57 B: i think my neighbourhood is kinda like a more mature neighbor- you know like people who are retired and older people so there aren't a lot of kids in my neighborhood so this year i got 

171.68 172.69 A: yeah 

172.40 184.59 B: no trick or treaters i have a coworker though who lives in kind of a neighborhood where you know there are younger families so there are a lot of kids and she said she got a lot of trick or treaters so i think 

184.82 190.73 B: the amount of trick or treaters one gets depends you know a lot on what what kind of neighbourhood you live in 

187.69 188.74 A: yeah 

189.43 190.44 A: i live 

190.65 200.34 A: yeah i lived in a a kind of a poor neighborhood where there usually are lots of trick or treaters you know and there was a ton of kids and we didn't get any trick or treaters 

195.63 197.53 B: (( mm hmm )) 

200.05 201.46 B: (( hm )) 

200.48 214.51 A: they just didn't they didn't come and we had like our gates open and you know we put the dog in the house yeah lights on we had to like yell out to the few kids who did come to make 'em come over i don't know it's really strange mm hmm 

205.36 206.61 B: lights on 

214.20 218.64 B: hm now the other thing i have a another coworker who has 

218.99 220.98 B: she's like six years old 

221.26 236.12 B: and one thing that they did this year you know i asked them are you going to take your kid trick or treating and he said no we're not going do we're not going to go for like from house to house and i said well what are you going to do and he said well we're going to take the kid the child to the mall 

236.15 237.55 B: i said really 

236.82 238.91 A: oh they going from store to store 

238.47 239.89 B: yeah 

239.59 242.21 A: yeah 'cause stores do give out candy 

240.19 241.06 B: and 

242.25 244.62 B: y- exactly he said 

245.00 253.81 B: what he said is a it's like safer 'cause you know the chances of getting attacked or mugged in a shopping mall are like next to zero 

252.44 253.46 A: yeah 

253.67 266.58 B: it's also safer that you know let's say you get this bag of candy and you know you got some cuckoo you know some kook in the neighborhood he poisons the candy and kills the kids that's probably not going to happen if you get all your candy at a store 

263.37 264.40 A: yeah 

266.43 267.55 A: yeah 

266.61 269.89 B: you know from the different stores and the third thing he said was 

270.28 283.17 B: [laughter] just efficiency sake you know you can go from store one to store two pretty quickly if you're going from one house to the next you know you have to walk up the walkway ring the doorbell wait for the person to answer 

276.06 277.14 A: yeah 

282.99 297.05 B: you know the person answers trick or treat you get the candy then you have to walk down the walkway down the sidewalk to the next walkway up the walkw- knock answer and it takes so much longer so he said you know you get more candy when you go to the mall and oh 

294.18 295.50 A: yeah 

296.16 301.42 A: yeah it's kind of unfortunate though 'cause i really i don't know i just like the old way of doing things you know 

301.87 302.77 B: right 

301.92 309.27 A: like my yeah my last couple of thanksgivings haven't even been as what they were before when i was a kid you know 

309.35 311.19 A: 'cause i don't know it's just 

311.57 313.59 A: everything just gets a little bit different 

314.23 315.00 B: (( i think )) 

314.42 319.76 A: maybe when i have kids i'll try and make it kind of the way it was [laughter] but probably not 

319.65 324.36 B: well you know holidays they they all evolve 

324.34 325.46 A: yeah 

324.40 328.98 B: see everything evolves constantly and maybe like now people are 

328.81 339.50 B: like you said a little bit more paranoid and a little bit more safety conscious so they don't want to go out but maybe you know little you know ten years from now the trend will be the other way people will be a little bit more open and a little bit more 

339.40 344.06 B: community minded and will be more able to 

344.13 345.61 A: trust each other 

345.36 353.61 B: exactly or or you know like my first coworker the one who actually lives in a neighborhood where there are a lot of kids you know i guess 

346.57 347.54 A: yeah 

353.96 357.63 B: in some parts of the state there are still neighborhoods 

357.65 360.41 B: like [mn] that'll do things 

358.46 372.16 A: yeah there are still some yeah i think i'm just in los angeles so and in san francisco there was no trick or treaters either 'cause you know the neighborhoods are so compact and all the apartments are closed off from people so 

369.01 369.80 B: (( ye- )) 

371.46 374.21 B: yeah makes it hard now what part of l. a. are you in 

374.23 378.48 A: um i live in los angeles los angeles like in the wilshire district 

378.48 379.97 B: (( in the wilshire okay )) 

379.85 381.98 A: yeah just south of hollywood 

382.13 383.19 B: okay 

382.34 387.00 A: what was what was the second question that i heard the machine ask i don't remember 

386.68 391.34 B: if you were to make up your own holiday what would it be 

390.34 393.68 A: (( oh yeah yeah uh do you have an answer for that )) 

393.76 397.27 B: no [laughter] you answer first i'll think while you answer 

397.18 398.38 A: um 

397.30 399.19 B: or do you have an answer 

399.33 402.28 A: i don't know probably just like a a 

402.98 414.17 A: a community day you know where you kind of you know how they used to have block parties and stuff i've never been to one of those so i always wish there was a day where you know people celebrated community and just 

407.53 408.40 B: mhm 

414.19 420.54 A: got together [noise] with their neighbors an- and you know celebrated together [noise] and maybe had a drink 

420.61 430.86 A: potlucks or you know and got to know each other because a lot of people don't do that so yeah i you know as opposed to mothers' day fathers' day like community day i think that would be mine 

429.44 430.09 B: tha- 

430.60 437.42 B: that's actually a very good idea 'cause i mean those type of things make a community just 

432.87 433.90 A: yeah 

437.83 441.68 B: you know it's so much nicer when you live in a place where you know 

439.98 441.06 A: yeah 

441.96 452.42 B: you know everybody around you i mean even if it's just kind of like a just a friendly first you know friendly basis you don't need to know like all their intimate details and whatnot but just you 

443.94 445.07 A: (( definitely )) 

448.67 449.75 A: yeah 

452.35 461.65 B: know hey that guy there the the guy's fred he's a- architect and that that lady there my neighbor sally she's an accountant that type of thing 

456.65 457.85 A: yeah 

461.59 464.58 A: yeah that would be i don't know i think that would be a good idea 

464.97 466.79 A: maybe i'll pitch it to someone 

467.26 468.27 B: i'm sorry 

468.18 471.90 A: maybe i'll pitch it to the government to make a community day 

470.15 471.35 B: yeah 

471.76 483.51 B: or you know even make it like er maybe even start it like at the city level just start at your whatever ci- well l._a.'s a big city but if you lived in like a smaller city you they they like that type of thing 'cause it helps 

476.19 477.29 A: yeah 

482.85 486.46 A: yeah definitely well do you have any ideas for that or 

486.07 492.28 B: well the idea that just popped into my head and again it just kind of popped into my head is kind of like a 

493.10 497.32 B: like an international day a day where 

495.34 496.21 A: ooh 

498.59 499.63 B: you know 

499.53 501.76 A: celebrating other cultures kind of 

500.86 510.92 B: other cultures yeah and tolerance basically you know a day where yeah you're just supposed to learn about another culture you know i think th- 

503.60 504.76 A: yeah 

510.10 511.56 A: that would be cool 

511.14 524.50 B: the world's getting obviously smaller and smaller and smaller and we're all getting more you know americans are becoming more intertwined with the rest of the world as the rest of the world's getting more intertwined with everything so 

523.82 524.98 A: yeah 

524.56 529.79 B: it's just a day where i think you take time out just to learn 

529.81 534.97 B: about other cultures other lands other peoples other religions 

534.98 536.50 B: that type of thing 

536.30 538.06 A: wow that would be amazing 

538.49 546.47 B: um i don't know if it would actually work i think actually your idea is better 'cause really your idea could 

538.70 539.51 A: huh 

546.93 560.33 B: could you know really help communities come together whereas my idea i think would just be kind of like oh you go to a festival for a day or something you think wow those people know those other countries are neat but then you forget about it 

557.02 558.85 A: yeah but 

560.17 564.61 A: yeah that's a good idea too though because i mean you know we used to have um 

565.48 572.23 A: fairs in junior high in high school where it would be like you know cultural different cultures and stuff and that 

571.04 572.13 B: oh like like 

572.56 585.37 A: yeah [noise] we would just like have different foods and different musicians and stuff and i mean you know it's kind of like a day where you had to learn tolerance [noise] and take time out to like recognize other cultures so it was 

584.08 588.68 B: so they'd pick like like one other country or like today will be china day 

588.28 591.63 A: yeah it would go on for like a week or something and there'd be like 

592.37 599.58 A: different representatives of like europe asia and africa and latin american so it was pretty cool
