170.57 171.55 B: yeah 

173.98 184.12 A: like a little [mn] immigrant's day where they'd have parades about that would kinda celebrate everybody's backgrounds you know like and just in school like everybody kind of sharing 

184.26 188.04 A: you know where they're from what the traditions of their family were [mn] 

187.57 191.32 B: yeah that that would be a great holiday that would be in- inclusive 

190.88 198.31 A: [noise] [noise] yeah and you'd like get to learn like celebrate your own past but then also like learn [noise] more about other people you know mhm 

191.34 192.80 B: uh it's it's 

197.35 211.08 B: right it would be a a an [mn] it would be open to every it would still be a holiday that's open to everybody like they always have a big fit about columbus day or they have a you know saint patrick's day or whatever that's only for one particular group of 

202.22 203.41 A: [noise] 

211.20 220.01 B: americas you know that's tha- that's kind of an interesting concept you know because none of us are then i guess native americas are
