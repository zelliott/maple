165.99 166.83 A: i 

166.92 176.56 A: i really you know but i guess some of the stuff that's come out and is currently coming out i think last this last week where they've

189.42 192.82 B: i'm i don't know i've always had kind of a 

192.92 200.42 B: a sour opinion of france and the people there just because how they they just dislike americans you know 

201.00 205.22 B: and they and after this i really don't like it over there [laughter] 

201.03 201.84 A: yeah 

205.99 207.50 A: yep and um

209.36 222.79 A: no no i don't i don't i know that there are a few um that don't agree with what france has done that we have a a gentleman that works er where we work where i work 

222.83 227.41 A: and um he is french and um he said uh 

227.58 229.02 A: he didn't agree with it 

229.54 233.63 A: and he said it makes me ashamed of my own people and 

233.41 234.49 B: wow 

234.04 236.35 A: so there are a few out there 

235.89 242.10 B: yeah i can imagine it's you know not not the whole country just like here in the united states there's some people who 

242.22 244.72 B: for some reason don't agree with what we're doing 

245.32 245.94 A: (( mm )) 

245.34 247.95 B: or don't don't believe that it's right you know 

247.96 256.23 A: no there are and that's what makes us free you know free to be able to do it you know to to be able to say no i don't agree with it 

248.87 249.61 B: and 

250.53 251.37 B: (( yes )) 

255.72 258.85 B: yeah and i i'm thankful for that right 

256.37 257.44 A: um 

258.43 269.76 A: mhm but i don't think that they have the right to sit in the streets and block the traffic and and you know uh tie up our policemen 

259.03 259.76 B: but 

260.92 261.78 B: yeah 

265.30 266.24 B: (( no no )) 

269.78 273.90 A: when you know that i don't believe have a peaceful march 

274.07 275.52 A: go for it 

274.79 279.46 B: yeah speak your mind you know when when you have an opportunity to but don't 

279.51 282.45 B: don't interfere in our everyday lives with it you know 

282.37 283.58 A: absolutely 

284.21 285.45 A: definitely 

284.33 293.83 B: but yeah i just it just doesn't even seem real that we've gotten fo- so far along that you know we're starting to actually rebuild the place 

293.95 300.21 B: to actually have them wanna be free and to wanna be like us and it's just amazing [laughter] you know 

294.02 294.93 A: yes 

300.21 301.75 A: yes i i 

301.92 305.85 A: i do hope that they will be able to 

306.86 310.64 A: [sigh] have a balance there of representation 

310.38 311.26 B: yeah 

310.67 312.77 A: um i i worry 

313.08 314.81 A: that the shiites 

315.30 317.37 A: will try and overrun it 

317.44 318.44 A: um 

319.87 324.53 A: you know um true you know the majority of the people are muslim 

324.63 326.78 A: and that's fine you know 

326.43 327.72 B: mhm 

327.31 328.79 A: but um 

328.86 336.23 A: i hope we can find that they you know that they can establish a fair representation of all the people 

336.08 342.89 B: yeah where they can at least like we we believe over here that it doesn't matter what religion you choose 

342.79 353.50 B: as long as we can get along and enjoy our freedom together it would sure be nice if they can somehow figure something out like that 'cause i agree with you i think that 

344.52 345.86 A: absolutely 

354.03 356.38 B: so many of them are gonna be so [sigh] 

357.59 359.22 B: hard to uh 

360.05 362.75 B: hard to understand the other side 

362.43 363.55 A: mhm 

362.77 370.12 B: as far as their own people even you know that they're just gonna say i'm right and this is all there is and if it doesn't go this way then 

370.69 374.07 B: it'll end up being just like what we just got rid of you know 

374.54 376.42 A: yeah th- that's true 

376.64 377.68 A: (( that's true )) 

376.67 383.29 B: but i'm just i'm hoping knocking on wood that things can just be planned out right and hopefully they can 

383.38 387.91 B: you know understand that we deal with the same situation only with us it's 

387.92 400.94 B: you know we've got baptists and catholics and jews and and any kind of religion out there yeah and we get along fine you know we can stand hand in hand you know it would sure be nice if we can somehow 

392.68 395.29 A: and muslims mhm mhm 

401.42 403.90 B: indoctrinate that into them you know 

404.03 414.49 A: yes yeah their their cultures are so very different than ours and um i i think that's that's one thing that we have to work in 

414.82 418.41 A: is um their culture you know um 

416.77 417.65 B: mhm 

419.25 420.26 A: which 

421.80 423.62 A: takes in a lot 

423.83 427.23 A: of their religion you know but um 

429.22 433.75 A: [mn] it's not going to be easy and i don't think it's gonna be quick 

433.97 435.33 B: no i don't either 

434.62 437.47 A: and um i just i 

438.91 440.36 A: i hope that 

440.78 443.39 A: you know a lot of people we're just such 

443.47 444.99 A: aren't we just such a 

445.09 449.42 A: instant society we want everything instantly 

449.07 451.98 B: yeah we think well why can't you just 

449.91 451.32 A: yeah 

452.17 457.99 B: mirror us right now [laughter] you know be exactly like us but they're never gonna be like us 

453.83 456.58 A: [laughter] 

458.23 459.14 A: (( no )) 

458.31 462.89 B: they might be they'll be better off because they're not underneath that guy's 

462.93 470.81 B: stronghold any more but it's gonna be it's gonna be a totally different kind of society than ours 

464.67 466.32 A: oh absolutely 

470.91 471.90 A: yeah 

471.99 474.88 A: yeah i [mn] oh i i think so 

475.15 479.41 A: but hopefully it will be a society that will be able to 

480.59 484.71 A: [sigh] accept america and be allies with america 

485.57 487.39 A: you know i think you know 

487.53 488.81 A: instead of 

489.78 492.15 A: like france slap us in the face 

491.97 499.57 B: yeah and then you know as soon as we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel as soon as they started to thank us and pr- you know 

499.56 509.27 B: tell us we we are glad that you came here and tried to get him off of us and we appreciate that then then france just wanted to be all a part of it then 

509.33 511.55 B: but they wanted to be a part of the uh 

511.79 520.93 B: you know they wanted to have some kind of part of rebuilding it you know have have i want my share but they sure didn't wanna help us 

515.66 516.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

521.57 525.83 B: they just i get on my soapbox because it it does bug me you know 

525.03 534.16 A: no i [mn] it's it's funny because i just so totally agree with what you're saying um i really do 

534.21 535.70 A: it it's like 

536.38 537.66 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

539.96 544.76 A: i think they're trying to get their hand in it because they wanna ensure 

544.80 546.16 A: (( their )) 

547.91 553.10 A: [sigh] agenda they want to they wanna ensure their portion 

553.66 556.26 A: and um to make sure that 

556.45 561.17 A: that they get benefit out of it it's for their benefit it's not for anybody else's 

560.77 564.59 B: yeah that's just so selfish you know 

565.14 566.38 A: (( yes it is )) 

565.52 575.97 B: we when when we're we're you know we've lost some lives already we've we've had to we've paid the ultimate price which is what war is you know 

576.01 581.31 B: and what have they paid they haven't given anything other than a headache 

581.95 585.30 A: no they've they've they've done and paid nothing 

586.17 589.41 A: no no wait a minute maybe they paid saddam [laughter] 

588.46 590.36 B: [laughter] 

592.04 597.55 B: but it it sure is nice to get to see images now of american flags waving
