68.68 72.25 A: you know 'cause everybody's busy sort of regular throughout the whole year 

72.21 79.08 B: [noise] i think it's because you know i have one child but i have nieces and nephews and you see it through a child's eyes

110.86 111.92 A: okay 

111.65 116.53 B: you know i think if we had a deadbeat parents' day and you put all the deadbeats' pictures up 

117.49 121.00 B: [noise] and you know that way you can show them what they're missing 

121.43 125.58 A: [noise] yeah yeah i mean i i was thinking

130.38 133.12 A: (( that's that's that would be sorta nice yeah because )) 

132.94 134.36 B: (( [noise] you can quieten 'em )) 

133.31 141.13 A: thanksgiving thanksgiving and and christmas is right at the end of the year and there's nothing else for the rest of year really 

139.97 142.34 B: (( well i mean there's easter or ))

143.06 143.64 B: (( [noise] )) 

145.57 151.39 A: know there aren't too many people actually actually celebrate you know and feel obligated to go 

149.34 154.20 B: yeah i think it's more yeah it's more like a holy day for some people 

153.43 159.62 A: yeah not a lot of other fe- a lot of people feel obligated to go and celebrate with their families they tend to celebrate [mn] 

155.42 155.98 B: (( [noise] )) 

158.45 162.41 B: you know they should have something where m- a family day 

162.38 164.21 A: yeah 

162.75 167.09 B: where just the whole family gets together and you're celebrating [noise] because you're together 

166.87 172.50 A: [noise] exactly that's that's what i'm thinking you know something of family oriented that would um 

173.53 178.68 A: that would um you know k- k- get us back together in the middle of the year at least you know 

174.07 182.81 B: [noise] [noise] yeah that you know be i say you kn- well it should be done 

179.01 180.65 A: (( that )) 

183.05 185.62 B: maybe like in the summer you know b- 

184.50 190.23 A: yeah some more time it gives us yeah there's a long period but even even if they have to eve- if you consider easter 

190.30 197.29 A: between easter and what's the next holiday that's really thanksgiving that's a really long break so 

192.31 194.98 B: [noise] and thanksgiving that's a long 

196.05 203.62 B: yeah they should have one day you know where we all get together and you put your differences aside and you get together as a family 

203.28 208.17 A: exactly because of the i mean that's why a lot of families nowadays have uh 

208.21 209.39 A: a lot of 

209.46 214.63 A: you know black areas that they don't know about you know a lot o- they're distant from each other 

212.01 217.02 B: because they only get together t- yeah they see each other twice a year if they're lucky 

215.86 218.23 A: and that's not enough 

217.50 221.01 B: no i think they should have it they should make it a legal day 

220.96 222.72 A: yeah 

221.35 224.85 B: where you just celebrate being together as a family 

224.80 226.67 A: exactly 

225.70 230.56 B: you know you could talk about what you did between [laughter] christmas and then 

231.61 236.36 A: that's yeah talk about your life [laughter] say hello tell 'em what's going on 

236.00 237.31 B: [noise] excuse me 

236.67 241.89 A: i said that you tell your family what's going on in your life yeah that's it you know because 

238.94 240.05 B: that's true 

241.93 249.52 A: you know you y- you just you come home and people don't know what you've been doing what you've been going through for the last you know 

250.02 252.28 A: eight months six months and [mn] 

251.72 255.51 B: yeah i mean we have a fathers' day you know we have a mothers' day 

252.53 254.62 A: thanksgiving [laughter] 

255.61 260.05 B: but it should be something for the whole family where everybody is included i 

259.92 261.16 A: exactly 

260.53 265.17 B: mean you don't have to you know i'm not saying give out presents nothing like that just celebrate 

265.20 267.91 B: that we're here we're alive and we're together 

267.94 274.92 A: exactly i mean that's j- it should be something of a non religious um factor i think too 

274.90 276.33 B: because nowadays 

274.95 280.19 A: 'cause you have family you have families that are not all of the same back- background of religion too 

278.64 286.71 B: yes they're insi- you have a lot of families that could be raised one way but it's like interfaced [cough] where they celebrate easter 

284.94 285.82 A: (( yes )) 

286.81 293.39 B: and some also celebrate passover so it should be a day that there's no religion involved 

293.23 294.12 A: yes 

293.71 296.15 B: (( [cough] it's just family )) 

295.78 303.71 A: yeah-huh that's what i think because i mean there's a lot of people that might get left out because there's easter and they're not catholic or you know they're not christian and they're married 

303.75 305.69 A: to a christian or 

305.93 315.85 A: you know things of that sort or their parents are christian and they're not christian you know they decided to take another path so they get left out you know the whole rest of the family is sitting together 

316.49 320.70 A: you know being happy and they're sitting out there just okay 

321.38 323.03 B: [noise] and that's true too 

322.82 324.93 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

323.94 333.66 B: yeah i mean at least this day there's no pressure of okay well i'm going to see the family so i have to go to church with them or i have to 

333.69 341.12 B: you know do what they want i mean if you had family day whe- you can have a barbecue you can or bring whatever you want 

341.54 348.35 B: and it's just like a you know a relaxing day where you catch up on what's been going on in each other's lives the last couple of months 

348.60 349.85 A: exactly 

349.90 351.89 B: i think that would make a good day 

351.66 353.03 A: yeah that's true 

352.01 354.89 B: and they can you know they can even post it or 

355.15 358.52 B: send out little invitations you can make up on the computer 

358.88 365.99 A: yeah exactly they could do that and i mean it's just [mn] some i don't know i just figure that there should it 

365.95 373.40 A: should be something during a warm weather i think 'cause you know during winter you're all hidden in the house and you can't do anything it 

373.30 384.51 A: gets crowded it'd be nice you know something warm would be nice in summer or or in the something turn time it's warm and enjoy you know going outside and enjoying 

384.10 388.47 B: mm you can have a big picnic a barbecue you know in the summer it's 

384.73 386.34 A: you know what i'm saying [noise] 

388.82 392.47 B: more warmer you can go to the you know even at the parks 

392.17 397.21 A: yeah it's different than the other holidays that we have which are in the winter and cold [noise] 

394.84 400.84 B: well it's not stressful and you know with christmas it's more like okay 

401.15 410.77 B: you know you gotta get the perfect gift and what if they don't like it and or i don't like this one so i [laughter] i still gotta get you know get this one a gift even though i like them 

401.30 402.20 A: (( yeah i m- )) 

406.44 409.09 A: there's so much pressure [laughter] 

409.69 410.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

411.08 418.91 A: you gotta clean up the house and make sure everything looks perfect so you know nobody makes a comment and it's too much pressure 

415.74 419.71 B: yes it's more like commercial than really being a family 

419.45 421.19 A: (( yeah )) 

419.97 428.75 B: so i would agree with that that they should you know if we can make up a holiday it should be a family day you know and not just for the in- you know intermediate family but [noise] 

422.16 423.02 A: (( [cough] )) 

425.33 426.74 A: (( exactly [mn] ))

434.61 441.03 B: you get together and you just have fun and you don't worry about okay i gotta you know what we're gonna do 

441.32 443.94 B: just something that's outdoors and relaxing 

444.12 456.44 A: yeah i was saying [mn] another thing i was gonna add should be not just immediate immediate family i mean yeah y- you've got families that are you know of adoptive adopted kids and so forth 

449.73 450.67 B: mhm 

456.40 466.57 A: you know if you just make it sound like it's a family family day you know then those kids might be left out you know once they find out they're really not part of the family they're adopted you know 

466.48 470.23 B: yeah well they should make it where it's extended family also 

466.66 467.51 A: (( you )) 

470.16 471.10 A: (( kn- yes ))
