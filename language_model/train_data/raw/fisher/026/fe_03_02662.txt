52.13 60.20 B: it's like it feels to me like we should all still take vacations like we did when we were kids you know beyond [laughter] beyond break [laughter] for the summer 

56.24 59.61 A: yeah [laughter] 

60.02 70.38 A: [laughter] i like christmas because not only i think it's a holiday for everybody um not only for kids but you know families your fa- you know most of 

64.51 65.66 B: yeah 

70.28 84.64 A: everyone's whole family gets together and the presents and things i think it's fun buying even though you hate afterwards where you have to pay all the bills [laughter] but i think it's fun to go out and buy presents for people and then to see the 

77.70 79.77 B: [laughter] 

84.62 90.55 A: the the happiness on the childrens' face so i think that's why i like you know christmas 

87.20 88.14 B: right

90.97 96.38 A: so um now we're supposed to stay on here for ten minutes right [laughter]

101.14 106.47 A: what's your well i guess they said that the holiday we like the m- the most right 

105.56 108.45 B: and then if you could make your own holiday what would it be 

108.49 109.93 A: hm 

110.16 112.04 A: probably 

113.49 116.34 A: a holiday would be the um 

116.41 123.57 B: see for me it's definitely something that involves eating [laughter] lots of cooking lots of food lots of frie- family and friends [laughter] 

118.74 119.98 A: really [laughter] 

120.07 120.85 A: [laughter] 

120.92 123.40 A: [laughter] 

123.47 132.09 A: i think it should be a day where you don't have to go to work i mean you know what i mean like a off work holiday 

127.40 129.11 B: yes i agree 

131.51 132.74 B: right 

132.11 135.55 A: um where everyone is off of work and you just 

136.05 142.93 A: do whatever you want to do but nothing conce- concerning work [mn] 

141.54 146.37 B: right like they can't even make you take something home with you [laughter] 

144.24 154.35 A: right [laughter] if you work on the phone at like if your job if you work on the phones i think you shou- you shouldn't even touch the phone that day 

153.22 154.78 B: mm mhm 

154.46 159.62 A: um just i don't know just something like that i think that would be a cool holiday 

157.25 159.48 B: no computers for anybody 

159.97 166.85 A: [laughter] 'cause a lot of the holidays other than like christmas and things a lot of people still have to work you know 

166.09 167.89 B: yeah no it's true 

167.57 168.54 A: so 

168.56 172.04 A: oh well that's what i i i think that would be pretty cool 

170.94 181.38 B: [noise] yeah i wish that we could come up with a holiday that was global that wasn't related to a particular country's event and that wasn't related to a particular religion's event either 

177.17 178.81 A: mhm 

180.95 182.85 A: (( yeah )) 

181.24 195.23 B: something that everybody could celebrate and nobody's gonna feel excluded i think that would be really valuable 'cause it seems like ei- i mean you know either you're celebrating something from your religion or something like the fourth of july so it's part- particularly american 

184.60 186.86 A: right right 

194.74 196.30 A: right 

195.43 198.74 B: you know that it doesn't mean anything to anybody else [laughter] outside of 

197.34 205.68 A: mhm independence day but i think um like canadians they have a independence day too but theirs isn't the same as ours though right 

198.77 200.15 B: america right 

204.47 206.44 B: right it's a different day 

205.72 217.50 A: it's a different day and then of course like with christmas you have the jehovah witnesses they don't celebrate it or kwan- yeah yeah exactly 

207.02 207.88 B: yeah 

212.82 213.72 B: right 

214.07 217.91 B: or anybody who's jewish or muslim or 

217.57 219.29 A: right so 

218.48 219.68 B: yeah 

219.35 221.37 A: now mothers' day 

221.02 224.01 B: well that's true is that international or just american 

222.81 227.62 A: yeah i think that's international mothers' day and fathers' day uh-huh 

224.93 226.61 B: oh well that might be 

227.33 228.61 B: are you a mother 

228.33 242.24 A: no i don't have any kids well i've got i have two step children but one's sixteen and the other one he's grown he's twenty seven [laughter] but um i have a lot of niece and nephews [laughter] 

228.76 229.58 B: oh 

229.59 230.88 B: me neither [laughter] 

232.29 233.33 B: (( oh okay )) 

235.86 237.73 B: [laughter] 

240.96 244.80 B: right you're does your whole family get together on most holidays mhm 

244.59 254.44 A: yes uh-huh my father he just passed um last month so i think like memorial day will be kinda you know 

253.86 255.18 B: mhm it'll be tough 

254.85 260.51 A: yeah it'll be kinda sad because you know he's always been there so 

259.83 260.69 B: right 

261.49 265.36 A: but [sigh] that's one of those things in life 

263.94 266.72 B: and has your mother already passed or is she still around okay 

265.70 274.18 A: no she's still alive mhm yeah so um i think it'll be harder for her than than us you know than the children 

273.73 275.52 B: right do you have a big family 

274.38 276.92 A: (( uh excuse me )) 

276.13 277.68 B: you've a big family 

277.20 280.11 A: um it's four i have four brothers and sisters 

279.48 281.73 B: that's pretty big [laughter] 

280.20 283.25 A: mhm well six of us [laughter] 

281.96 285.35 B: well i'm an only child so yeah 

284.71 286.81 A: oh 

285.98 296.95 B: but uh my dad's got a brother and a sister and they all have kids in my generation and uh [sigh] so and we all live real close by so it seems like having brothers and sisters sometimes [laughter] 

292.77 293.64 A: (( really ooh )) 

296.11 300.83 A: right so how many children do you have oh you don't 

298.06 304.49 B: oh i don't have any yet i i definitely plan to just not not yet i'm too young so 

301.24 302.27 A: uh-huh 

303.01 305.69 A: do you want to have a lot of kids 

304.73 308.89 B: i don't know i mean there seem to be nice a- there's something nice about being an only 

308.97 319.07 B: you know you get all that one on one time with your parents and everything but on the other hand you know when i get older and my parents get older and they need taking care of and stuff like that i'm going to be all on my own 

310.59 313.17 A: mhm mhm 

318.77 320.07 A: right 

319.36 323.57 B: that's gonna be tough and plus i think holidays would be more fun to have 

321.63 325.32 A: [laughter] but um 

324.07 326.34 B: you know the more people you have 

325.98 332.81 A: u- usually people that don't have any siblings they usually have at least two children don't they 

332.49 334.24 B: (( do they i don't know )) 

333.50 344.57 A: i'm thinking because they usually they think that with them knowing that they've only been the only child they would want their child to have another sibling 

344.09 345.00 B: right 

344.72 348.86 A: i think that's it but then again the way the um 

349.71 353.26 A: economy is now it's it's it's rough 

352.83 360.56 B: yeah i think you're so much shaped by how you grow up like i have a friend who was who had a twin and he passed away when they were children 

353.69 354.64 A: (( you know )) 

360.04 360.96 A: uh-huh 

360.39 373.98 B: and so she swears now that she'll only ever have three kids or more so that god forbid something happens to one of them no one child is left alone because that's what she had to live with you know i think it's very much shaped by what you know 

364.92 365.65 A: (( ooh )) 

367.09 368.87 A: (( right )) 

369.29 370.19 A: right 

370.88 371.89 A: uh-huh 

374.23 375.26 A: (( mm )) 

374.87 376.26 B: how are the horses doing 

376.25 378.17 A: oh they just had one 

378.98 384.85 A: [noise] funny side ah [laughter] i think he was a long shot too 

379.72 381.65 B: [laughter] 

384.99 388.10 B: see this is kinda like a holiday people you know 

386.97 389.84 A: (( just be- mhm )) 

388.51 392.48 B: getting toge- it's kinda like a holiday to celebrate the kentucky derby 

391.25 402.82 A: yeah well there's so many celebrities there and it's a million dollar race and and it's it's a big upset because everyone was thinking that um 

394.34 395.46 B: yeah 

397.08 397.90 B: right 

402.73 406.26 A: this one they had a favorite horse called empire 

406.33 418.02 A: maker and he didn't he he didn't do anything did he [noise] he came in third [noise] but the this horse funny side i think his odds were real low he's the o- huh 

407.04 407.90 B: uh-huh 

417.91 421.97 A: twelve to one twelve to one odds um he's the one that won 

421.75 428.15 B: wow some somebody's real happy [laughter] somebody's laughing all the way to the bank 

422.25 423.41 A: but so- 

423.86 434.20 A: yeah [laughter] yeah but it's i i i haven't actually been i mean i live in kentucky 

433.69 434.51 B: right 

434.28 445.25 A: um i'm eighty seven miles from where the derby is and i've been up there to the derby festivities but i've never actually been in you know to the derby 

437.29 438.07 B: uh-huh 

443.70 445.47 B: right watched it there 

445.25 448.43 A: but um here where i live and in lexington 

448.36 462.04 A: they have kingland where there's usually like twenty seven thousand people that go out there today on derby day and you can go out there and bet it's just like you're there at kingland i mean you know i mean at churchill down you know 

459.20 460.19 B: right 

461.21 464.03 B: like an off track betting kind of a thing [mn] 

462.25 467.62 A: yeah yeah so i've been out there couple of years in a row and it's fun 

467.18 469.44 B: yeah it must get really high energy 

469.07 470.16 A: mhm 

469.49 478.89 B: see that's another thing i like about holidays in general is that everybody gets so especially the little kids are all pumped up on sugar and everybody's all high energy and 

477.34 479.32 A: right right 

479.22 489.04 B: but i guess also that's why it's hard for some people like people who get you know depressed around the holidays or whatnot i know that's pretty common for people too now that i think about it 

484.35 485.24 A: mhm 

488.70 496.16 A: right right that's that's true and you know i i 'cause i hear like christmas and 

489.50 490.55 B: (( i don't know )) 

496.50 500.49 A: is it christmas and new years where you know they have those um 

500.58 513.08 A: help centers that you call like the people that are real- yeah the people that are really depressed what is the two holidays that they call the most christmas and thanksgiving or christmas and new years 

502.47 504.36 B: oh like a mental help line 

511.59 513.66 B: well you've gotta bet christmas is one of 'em 

513.45 518.65 A: yeah i think it's christmas and new years or christmas and thanksgiving one of 

518.96 524.13 A: those are the two where they have the most telephone calls that's sad isn't it 

521.44 522.35 B: right 

523.63 525.13 B: yeah it's 

524.45 527.15 A: mhm that's when they said people 

525.39 526.17 B: (( [mn] )) 

527.16 532.33 A: more people want to commit suicide and stuff like that yeah 

529.26 530.74 B: (( right yeah yeah )) 

531.90 541.48 B: okay so why do you think christmas eve is usually social like people have friends and they go visiting and stuff but christmas morning is usually family why do you think that is 

541.46 545.14 A: [mn] why do more people go to visit friends on christmas eve 

544.57 553.09 B: yeah instead of christmas morning like i don't know my experience with my friends has always been that they people go visiting on christmas eve but they always stay home with family christmas morning 

545.94 547.23 A: (( 'cause they go )) 

552.34 561.55 A: right um be- uh christmas mor- christmas morning and day is more for the family where christmas eve um 

561.58 570.06 A: a lot of people go out and drink socially [laughter] on christmas eve [laughter] and then they go to see um 

563.95 566.48 B: (( [laughter] )) 

566.49 567.32 B: (( [laughter] )) 

570.66 578.71 A: um well i know some like when my sister's my niece when she was smaller i would go over there and help my sister put her stuff together 

578.23 579.19 B: mhm 

578.92 580.05 A: um 

580.57 592.05 A: a- and it it just depends on if a lot of people that don't have children that go ov- to people's houses that do have kids on christmas eve just to you know give a hand or whatever 

591.48 592.50 B: right 

592.14 599.89 A: but like i said a lot of people go around socially [laughter] drinking [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

595.30 599.89 B: [laughter] to drink right i guess they don't want to be drinking first thing in the morning [laughter]
