44.34 52.13 B: [sigh] i'm kind of the same way i i was really against it when we were first going in and i thought it was really kinda 

52.15 54.93 B: stupid that we told them our entire 

54.98 60.93 B: plan of action and [laughter] like we're going to go in and do this and then this and then this 

61.08 70.64 A: ri- right yeah i i just was [sigh] i was like wait a minute what's this is just i i just thought it was so absurd it was just so obvious that they're doing it for 

70.66 77.18 A: ulterior motives an- and this whole thing about like chemical weapons was just a big facade which it probably still is 

72.48 73.55 B: (( uh-hum )) 

77.06 86.57 A: but ah um i don't know i just i'm just glad it was over as fast as it was and you know not as many people got hurt i thought it was going to be like another vietnam times ten 

86.51 87.77 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

86.65 94.77 A: [sigh] [noise] so i was like you know oh this is going to be this is going to be a nightmare everyone's like everyone's going to hate us like they already hate americans now they're going to really hate us [noise] 

94.57 100.25 B: yep that's exactly how i felt i was just like why are we even going in here 

99.84 101.34 A: (( yeah yeah [noise] [laughter] )) 

100.35 108.33 B: why are we sending our people out to to do some personal vendetta [laughter] against them it 

107.80 111.82 A: yeah it almost was like a personal like you know daddy i'm gonna ye- 

110.53 124.40 B: was like bush was just going to go and do what he wanted to do and here we go and i've never been a very political person like i'm very apolitical i don't vote i don't [sigh] usually keep up on politics 

112.69 113.74 A: (( yeah [noise] uh-hum mm )) 

124.09 125.53 A: right 

124.66 129.49 B: so it's kind of a matter of why are we doin' this [laughter] [noise] 

128.78 139.52 A: yeah yeah i just thought that i also like i had i'd gotten laid off and i we- i was just thinking this is just a just just a big distraction from the real issues that are going on here [sigh] 

139.34 152.66 A: and um and it was just like well you plug all that money when they you know when they said it was going cost [noise] like seventy billion dollars like seventy to ninety billion [sigh] like you know if you spent i guess they did a study if you spent i don't know how many billions of dollars like even half of that much 

152.52 155.20 A: you'd be able to give everyone in this country health care 

154.75 155.97 B: right 

155.39 169.27 A: and it was like come on you know an- an- and you could you know re-stimulate jobs or create um you know ah you kn- i mean educate poor people it's just it's just so look th- to me it's like such an absurd thing in the big in the long run like in the big picture 

169.17 180.17 B: right why why spend all that money to go to [noise] war instead of and i i mean it very well could have and still could i think turn into a world war three i mean we 

169.44 170.65 A: (( you know [noise] )) 

172.71 174.48 A: right 

178.87 187.07 A: [noise] yeah yeah i thought that too i thought we're well it's going to be kind of maybe beginning of world war three with like russia and and france against us 

185.81 189.80 B: we've got so many countries pissed with us [laughter] because of 

188.13 199.93 A: yeah yeah but i guess we just kind of muscled our way you know it's just so funny how we ended up with just muscling our way through again and everyone just being so kind of um 

199.86 201.37 A: you know non 

201.22 212.56 A: non violent but you know it's almost like violence [noise] you know wins in the end in in some weird way at least now i mean in the [sigh] you know i think in in the other world after world or whatever there is [sigh] 

205.48 206.83 B: (( this uh-hum )) 

212.32 217.99 A: (( i think we're [laughter] i think [laughter] there's going to be people are going to be paying for their deeds i i i truly do )) 

213.17 214.10 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

217.65 218.74 B: yeah 

218.46 230.51 A: yeah i an- and um so [noise] i don't know ah that's my take [laughter] i can't even talk you know it's like you can only talk i really talked about this thing so much in my own head in my own like i had the conversation with myself for so long now 

226.28 227.44 B: (( yeah )) 

230.34 234.96 A: that [noise] now i i'm just like i just want to move on and not want to think about it [laughter] 

234.13 239.33 B: yeah when it first started like everybody i met was against it they were all against the war and i 

237.65 238.64 A: yeah 

239.19 250.54 B: just said [sigh] i don't know anybody who is for this war and then i said that to my mom and she was like well i think it's a really good thing and we're going in there we need to support the troops and blah blah blah blah blah [laughter] 

243.33 244.27 A: yeah 

249.70 263.76 A: yeah i think once it became like once the troops were in and an' like all these people got behind it but before that like what if you asked a normal like a person who had any intelligence you know like why are we going to war [sigh] i i i mean i can't imagine ah like like americans 

263.59 273.90 A: going well um because 'cause of terrorism we need to get rid of those guys and i mean it was really they really there was no rea- i mean really was no good reason 

267.89 268.66 B: [laughter] 

273.66 275.35 B: (( yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

273.90 280.57 A: this whole chemical weapons thing and if they don't find them now an- and then if they're get in the hands of someone who

292.23 296.46 B: [sigh] yeah i think i i don't know i think if we were 

296.71 304.68 B: gonna do the war we probably [noise] shouldn't have given him as much warning as we did [sigh] it should be like okay you can leave now [sigh] 

302.82 307.72 A: [noise] yeah yeah it's true they gave them kind of ah time they to to get ready to get out an'

355.43 359.59 A: [sigh] but i don't know if it's our business to go in there [noise] and y'know straighten them out mm 

359.12 360.44 B: [laughter] yeah i 

360.33 374.39 B: i don't know why we think it's automatically us that's gotta [sigh] you know people in favor of the war all the all along were saying well we've gotta protect ourselves [sigh] like how are we protecting ourselves they're half way around the world 

373.77 375.60 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

374.30 383.42 B: they're not really you know yeah they might have the nuclear weapons but ah we gave them enough warning that if they had them they took them somewhere else

397.49 398.58 A: yeah 

397.98 406.78 B: that he you know tortured them and raped them and this and that and the other thing why did we think that he was gonna leave the country to save the destruction

410.53 412.10 A: yeah we gave him 

412.22 414.11 A: yeah i mean it's funny when you 

414.24 428.11 A: there you look at like right back in the eighties and donald rumsfeld meeting personally with saddam hussein like shaking his hand and do do you know about that story the back story of this he actually yeah wh- when they were in the iraq iran war we were supporting iraq

452.90 453.91 A: no 

454.27 469.17 A: and the- then i mean the bottom line is i think actually they [noise] forgot about um israel and how they were really really really for us going in there [noise] they really wanted it they were like that was i think that was one of the main reasons why we went in there we went in there and no one really talks about 

468.84 469.90 B: (( uh-hum )) 

469.10 472.19 A: it it was an israel like factor the fact that they 

472.16 482.69 A: um [noise] it's it's kinda like [noise] it's going to create a balance in their favor when we're there like [noise] dominating iraq and you know occupying them [sigh] 

482.62 492.11 A: so [noise] yeah you know no one ever talks about that [noise] yeah talks about everyone talks about oil but no one [noise] talks about like the whole geopolitical strategy [sigh]
