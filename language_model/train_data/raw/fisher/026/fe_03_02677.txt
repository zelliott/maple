228.58 230.90 A: [noise] [noise] that's my other phone again 

230.94 234.88 A: hold on one second but i agree with that that appreciation hold on one second 

238.59 240.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

241.51 242.21 A: (( all )) 

244.14 245.97 A: right you can finish 

244.70 245.52 B: okay 

246.13 247.23 B: okay that's 

246.14 250.18 A: wait wait one more second 'cause [laughter] [noise] 

250.51 251.37 A: (( all )) 

252.33 253.17 B: [laughter] 

252.58 256.92 A: right that's weird because they called my house phone and nobody has my cell phone number 

256.54 257.34 B: (( uh )) 

256.98 265.19 A: for it to ring it was freaky all right i am so sorry 'cause we're talking about holidays and i want them to call me back again and i think an appreciation day we're both in agreement 

264.95 265.87 B: yes 

265.57 272.21 A: and you just pick somebody who has done something special so this way it's at least you can bring in all those people who 

272.23 274.02 A: don't get a special day 

273.68 274.90 B: yeah 

274.30 283.21 A: and then maybe you know people would think of them but of course they might think well that's a nice way to say it appreciation day you wouldn't want it to be a pity day you know [laughter] 

281.27 285.26 B: [mn] no not a pity day that's not a celebration [laughter] 

284.18 287.26 A: no so you like want to make people feel special you 

286.39 289.97 B: yeah make 'em feel special make 'em feel like honored 

287.75 291.34 A: and then this way you can come out with any idea that you want 

291.33 292.55 B: yeah 

291.92 295.34 A: and i think it's right i think it should be in the summer time too 

295.10 296.28 B: yeah 

295.62 299.28 A: so that it can be you know just a very lively bright 

299.30 300.28 B: yeah 

299.68 310.58 A: time because ah you have all the other holidays and the thanksgiving and christmas and everything take up the winter a lot you have halloween and all those so i think yeah right in the midst of summer 

300.61 301.78 B: exactly 

311.37 313.54 A: [sigh] i'm gonna say august 

314.25 316.55 B: [mn] eh i'd say june 

315.93 317.13 A: you say june 

316.72 317.85 B: yeah 

317.82 318.45 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

317.95 322.33 B: 'cause it's everything is still new august it's so hot 

322.44 326.30 B: you're in s- you're sweltering in humidity and heat what's that 

323.33 328.08 A: that's true that's true that's true that's true you've got a good point there 

328.57 340.61 A: [mn] and what kind of food would we serve [laughter] at the [mn] the person's favorite food that would be like you have to do something in honor of them and you have to find something that they like and you do that with them 

328.61 330.07 B: [mn] i think yeah 

331.12 332.71 B: what kind of food 

333.96 335.82 B: yeah exactly 

340.40 341.20 B: (( yeah )) 

340.56 345.48 A: and then something that they like to eat and that's what you serve or you go out to eat 

343.70 344.92 B: yeah 

345.15 350.46 B: and the food from their gener- or the uh music would be from their generation whatever they're into 

350.72 355.56 B: you know something that takes them back to when they were young and in their prime 

354.94 356.71 A: i think that's good [mn] 

356.22 359.28 B: because like i was playing a lot of uh 

359.66 361.60 B: the old music from the um 

361.73 366.96 B: twenties and the thirties and the rest of the family at the family reunion didn't appreciate it 

366.95 378.40 B: so i'd say the music would have to be from when they were in their prime and ev- every generation has its music that's why they have that's why the older generation really don't like the new generation's rap you know what i mean 

369.15 370.37 A: for the person 

370.38 371.51 A: yeah 

377.75 379.03 A: right right 

378.81 382.90 B: that type of thing that type of music and um [mn] 

383.32 391.53 B: and r- you know i think basically every family has that one relative that everybody appreciates yup 

388.63 395.03 A: that does stand out exactly yeah like i have aunts that have been just like moms to me 

394.53 395.75 B: mhm 

395.06 401.45 A: but you know there's not a special day for them i mean even though like i said you might get them a card or something on mother's day it's still not the same 

402.00 407.37 A: it's like it's not their day they s- it has to be something just specifically for them [mn] 

402.18 403.35 B: yeah 

406.79 411.46 B: but i'd say that would be about it because i'd i'd say we have enough holidays [mn] you know 

410.45 412.61 A: yeah yeah 

412.01 418.35 B: 'cause [mn] you know i mean [mn] over time you're gonna get to the point where every day is a holiday [laughter] and then it becomes insignificant [noise] 

415.95 417.06 A: that's true 

417.29 424.61 A: well you know there's certain holi- there's certain days like just card days that you don't even kn- like they started a grandmother's day and they start you know 

424.87 430.39 A: ah secretary's day and all those kind of things to you know to tr- but if you had just one appreciation day 

429.88 430.98 B: mhm 

430.65 436.81 A: that can cover all those people like the secretaries and of course hallmark wouldn't like that just one day you 

433.50 434.50 B: yeah 

437.00 438.93 A: have to have special days for everything 

438.66 449.38 B: oh yeah that way they can keep their sales up keep them employed keep the money rolling in but uh i'd say yeah i'd say the family i'd say a special family member 

440.74 441.53 A: (( [laughter] )) 

449.57 453.01 B: and their music and their food 

452.43 453.26 A: right 

453.16 458.81 B: the kind of food that they appreciate because you know if it gets to the point where you get sick of ham you get sick of 

458.87 464.18 B: it's actually i'm just i'm a- i'm at the point where i'm tired of food that's why i say 

462.29 463.43 A: oh really 

464.20 467.46 B: that's why when i when when you asked i said easter 

467.80 468.95 B: because 

468.98 474.91 B: that was a significant food and now that they're gone they've passed we don't have that anymore because 

472.32 473.31 A: yeah 

475.29 478.21 A: and it'll just always be associated with them and 

475.49 477.54 B: everything's quick and easy 

477.67 481.46 B: yeah that food is assoc- associated with them 

480.83 483.39 A: yeah i i wonder like if my mom died or 

483.77 489.04 A: what what would we continue our traditions or you know how would all that work because 

489.07 494.80 A: that's you know everything revolves around her and the special things that she does and makes at all the holidays 

495.09 497.16 A: it's like i wonder what would happen 

497.03 500.35 B: [noise] yeah well you'll have your then you'll have your own kids 

498.02 498.71 A: (( yeah )) 

499.73 502.30 A: yeah you've gotta try to make your own traditions i guess 

501.93 507.02 B: yeah and carry the ones on you know that that were existing and [noise] 

507.46 512.59 B: but you always have that special family member and mine is ida [laughter] 

512.12 512.98 A: (( [laughter] )) 

512.90 516.54 B: she was english she oh she was english so

530.60 532.44 A: oh did you and how'd that turn out 

531.86 535.07 B: [laughter] i didn't make it thick enough 

534.62 535.81 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

535.17 545.13 B: you're supposed to roll 'em up roll 'em up like cinnamon rolls and i didn't i rolled 'em too thin and it was just yeah well you know what i i'll forget next year and i'll forget what i did wrong 

537.16 538.05 A: uh-huh 

539.64 542.04 A: well you're just gonna have to keep working on it 

543.66 547.20 A: well you've got all year long to work on it before next easter you know 

547.02 548.57 B: oh my god 

547.81 552.53 A: i'm sure your girlfriend wouldn't would appreciate it if ya made her one once in a while [laughter] 

552.36 558.03 B: i'd say i'd say she'd be more interested in me losing about twenty pounds [laughter]
