0.05 1.28 A: hello 

0.60 2.88 B: hi [laughter] hi 

1.72 3.86 A: hi my name's tracey 

3.10 6.30 B: hi this is my first time doing this my name's nina 

5.81 10.56 A: okay this is my second time i did this yesterday matter of fact yeah 

8.26 14.89 B: oh really [laughter] they called me earlier and i wasn't home so [laughter] so 

11.98 13.78 A: oh okay 

13.84 16.41 A: yeah i'm i'm in l._a. are you in l._a. 

15.88 20.52 B: no i'm actually in massachusetts yeah right outside of boston 

17.93 19.66 A: oh okay 

19.97 21.48 A: yeah 

20.81 21.85 B: so 

21.72 23.14 A: okay uh 

21.96 24.42 B: this is weird all right 

23.60 28.05 A: the topic has to do with arms in iraq or something like that 

26.96 34.54 B: i think like in general like what to like what to do about the state of iraq or like what should the u._s. do or whatever 

33.99 40.05 A: yeah i'm not sure what the u._s. should do but i think it's north korea we should be worried about actually 

39.36 52.19 B: i know what you mean i know i just i mean the whole thing i mean i supported the troops in the first place but i don't know i i worry more about sort of what goes on domestically than sort of around the world which i know is sorta bad but 

48.49 49.80 A: (( uh-huh yeah mhm )) 

52.06 60.31 B: i don't know i don't wanna get like too involved with anything i just i don't know being the world's policeman just sort of unsettles me a little bit 

57.76 58.93 A: yeah 

59.66 74.49 A: yeah i've i've been really neutral about the whole thing i i think that [noise] whatever's going on here is way more important you know with with uh [cough] you know the county closing a lot of health uh places a lot of hospitals are closing down for poor people and 

61.71 62.94 B: yeah 

73.72 75.00 B: (( right [mn] [mn] )) 

74.49 78.62 A: um you know it's funny how they could come up with a billion dollars you know to 

78.65 84.93 A: fund the war but they don't have a billion dollars to you know get help homeless people find a better place to live 

83.83 93.19 B: i totally know what you mean actually uh well this guy that i was dating for six months i actually just broke up last week which i'm totally bung- bumming about but he was actually um 

93.22 104.81 B: in the first gulf war and we were watching the t._v. one time and he was like asking me my opinion and i'm like well you know i think we have like a lot of starving children here and the fact that we try to do all this stuff overseas i don't know 

102.05 103.09 A: (( mhm mhm uh-huh )) 

104.71 117.96 B: and like this wasn't even the reason why he broke up with me but he was like you know if you're really liberal you know i don't know if this is really gonna work you know because i'm really not and i'm like look i'm not a bleeding liberal i mean obviously i think people should take responsibility i said 

114.63 115.60 A: right 

117.90 127.34 B: you know but i just think it's weird and he said well he said the way it works there is um i guess as he put it the minority was ruling the majority 

127.00 128.19 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

127.53 131.85 B: and that children like were homeless like not because 

132.05 143.57 B: uh like like here like a lot of the young children are like basically he was sort of blaming it like not really on the system but like on the parents where there it was it's more like the system just really wasn't good 

143.06 144.30 A: right 

143.44 151.60 B: so that's why so but i know what you mean i just i don't really wanna get too too involved with iraq at this point i don't really see the point 

148.60 149.82 A: yeah 

151.21 155.93 A: there's a lot of people who are who are unusually patriotic at the moment you know 

155.38 156.95 B: i know 

156.09 166.13 A: and i never have been i'm i'm just not like that i don't care where i'm living i'm i'm not likely to go around carrying a flag i'm just not in- that involved i don't get that emotionally caught up 

164.11 174.87 B: i know i know like for for like either way i'm tot- i know i know that's why like this is so weird i'm like i have to talk about my opinion like what if i don't really have one [laughter] 

171.92 176.51 A: (( [laughter] yeah right and i was thinking this is a issue what am i gonna say you know )) 

175.33 177.93 B: (( [laughter] i know i know )) 

176.60 185.81 A: because i mean ev- even celebrities get on t._v. and all of a sudden you know they have something to say and all of a sudden you you don't hear about them any more because they're you know against the war whatever and that's totally unfair 

183.68 197.50 B: i know and so many of those celebrities like i mean i i don't know like obviously what your educational background is but like a lot of these people like like some of them like didn't like go to college or like really finish high school so it's like okay do they really have an educated opinion 

192.98 193.97 A: uh-huh 

196.94 198.66 A: right right 

197.60 201.39 B: so you know i mean not that i'm judging it's just i know what you mean 

201.11 202.35 A: yeah 

201.69 203.40 B: i know so 

203.42 204.32 B: i know 

203.58 208.82 A: i was i was glad they got the p._o._w.s back that i lost interest after they came back you know i was i was 

207.71 219.16 B: really i i was really glad about that i'm just glad it's like over basically like i don't know i think um bush gave a speech yesterday saying that it was like he was basically calling an end to to everything 

212.37 213.52 A: mhm 

218.77 219.90 A: yeah 

219.15 232.45 B: so i mean i'm glad about that i mean i'd rather have it be quick and not so dirty but the fact that anybody died is just rid- i don't know it's just rid- it just it just like it nauseates me but i guess you know that's the way it is i suppose so 

225.77 226.97 A: it's awful 

228.44 229.42 A: mhm 

231.61 239.55 A: the the most i was hoping for is that if uh if america really wanted to bring you know some sort of liberation to the uh to iraq 

239.34 251.37 A: i'm just hoping that the women can finally walk around without being afraid that uh if they're not you know covered up that they're gonna get hurt or like like i was reading an article about an iraqi woman who was uh 

247.35 248.41 B: right 

251.19 258.41 A: a doctor or at least she's studying to be a doctor and she was worried that if there's a new regime will they take that right away from her 

258.03 259.04 B: oh my 

258.37 270.30 A: will she have to wear what they call a burkha or something like that that's what i was conc- uh concerned about as far as liberation but i i don't feel the u._s. is interested in that kind of liberation i think they're they wanna 

260.34 261.62 B: right 

270.17 274.53 A: they want iraq to get a dictator that won't stop the oil from coming over here 

273.73 277.92 B: right well i don't even think i don't really think they want a dictator i mean 

276.70 278.76 A: mhm or you know someone some kind of 

277.97 280.52 B: yeah i know what you mean i totally know what you mean 

280.35 293.00 B: but um no i mean i guess as i said i guess the minority was well the majority was ruled by the minority so hopefully like if you know things turn around that that won't happen to that woman because the majority hopefully 

285.49 286.52 A: mhm 

292.99 296.65 B: um i think what what is what's the name of it like are they like um 

296.44 298.19 A: the shiite muslims or something 

297.44 304.95 B: yes thank you yes the shiites like they're the majority and i don't know i don't think they like really practice like all that stuff but um 

303.90 305.52 A: real serious yeah yeah 

305.31 312.03 B: i don't yeah i know i don't think they're as hard core but um i don't know it'll be interesting to see what happens i mean i'm just i'm just sorta glad it's over 

311.60 322.33 A: because you know with the taliban when they got the taliban out of afghanistan they changed things but from an article that i read not that long ago not a whole lot has changed over there as far as that's concerned yeah it's 

320.35 321.82 B: really [sigh] 

322.19 329.96 A: it's not like the taliban has come back but the rules are still the same women are still getting beat down in the streets there's still a lot of starvation um 

329.91 343.19 A: uh you have to be you know really very pro muslim to actually succeed or else you know it's just like being in iraq and having saddam there you know so who knows if they're ever going to find him one thing's for certain he's probably not dead 

338.23 339.54 B: right 

342.75 345.44 B: i don't think he's uh there's no way he's dead 

344.82 347.72 A: no uh uh just like osama's not dead [laughter] mhm 

346.91 357.89 B: i mean i think like it's funny when they show people that like they claim like are saddam like actually they don't look like him like they they they look like it could be like a decoy but like i don't really think that means saddam's dead 

357.62 358.64 A: right 

358.00 361.97 B: so but no i mean obviously i mean he's probably he's probably doing fine 

361.65 362.68 A: mhm 

361.96 370.28 B: you know and i just i don't i don't know i guess the whole thing just bothers me because it's like who's to keep them from coming over here or like send- you know sending missiles over here because 

370.13 377.28 B: obviously like they've sent scud mis- you know they basically like they did use scud missiles and technically they weren't supposed to have those 

376.97 378.22 A: oh 

377.31 382.79 B: so when they sit there and say oh no we don't have weapons of mass destruction it's like hello you just used scud missiles 

382.38 384.01 A: oh 

383.49 387.79 B: so yeah i don't know it'll it'll be interesting to see what happens but 

386.90 392.13 A: yeah because somebody told me that half the stuff they have the u._s. gave them when they were fighting iran 

391.75 394.96 B: [laughter] 

392.92 402.72 A: yes uh-huh yes that's why the u._s. wants to know where that stuff is they want it back [laughter] [laughter] yeah they half the stuff they're looking for they handed over to 'em 

396.52 400.26 B: [laughter] 

401.61 405.31 B: (( because they want they want it back indian givers [laughter] )) 

403.03 405.88 A: (( yeah now they're saying well that stuff you had can you give )) 

405.70 412.77 A: that back to us because we need that now yes see it wasn't illegal for them to have what they're hiding because it was given to them 

406.15 408.79 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

412.59 422.75 A: to fight uh iran when iran was paired up with russia and a couple of other people but now that that's over it's suddenly illegal for them to have the very thing that they received from us 

421.07 430.09 B: my god oh my god that that is really it i mean it's funny but it's sad [laughter] i believe it i totally believe it [laughter] 

425.33 427.12 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

428.33 440.39 A: [laughter] yeah yeah so so you know of course they're gonna hide that stuff they're thinking well as long as korea has you know nuclear this and that and and everybody else has got their stuff they're gonna keep theirs you know 

439.70 448.87 B: i know i just always feel like it's like one thing after another and it's like i don't really think they concentrate on like what's going on over here i mean people are starving here people are homeless here 

445.89 446.85 A: (( no mhm )) 

448.66 456.87 B: you know people you know i don't even think here can i mean yeah they feel free to you know they have their religious beliefs and they're free to some extent but i mean 

456.92 461.15 B: i don't know i just don't think there's enough being done for the the crap that goes on here 

460.72 467.18 A: mhm i'm wondering if the if the taxes are gonna go up you know uh to to pay for all this 

464.30 466.73 B: oh probably 

466.78 474.33 B: i know i know there's probably so much waste anyway i know yeah they probably will and i don't even wanna think about that 

470.08 471.10 A: yeah 

473.68 482.01 A: and see living over i i live in l._a. so i'm on the west coast and with that north korean thing going on over there that guy's thinking about sending missiles to hawaii 

481.67 482.72 B: oy 

482.44 495.92 A: yeah and hawaii is close to here you know you know he wants to start another pearl harbor because they said he's he's very uh their leader is very paranoid you know and he doesn't want the u._s. telling him what they can and cannot do 

484.90 486.75 B: (( [laughter] oh my )) 

491.24 492.43 B: (( god right )) 

496.02 504.18 A: so that that's the next thing it's like the guys may have come home today but they might as well keep their uniforms on because they're probably gonna have to go [laughter] to north korea now 

496.08 497.02 B: mm 

502.55 508.75 B: right i don't blame that guy i don't like i don't think we should be telling i mean i don't i don't know i mean i just 

508.72 518.20 B: i mean about world war two and all the stuff that happened then and it's like you know we should have gotten involved earlier because that was just wrong but i i don't know 

513.92 514.92 A: mhm 

518.34 519.34 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

518.36 523.46 B: it it's hard to say you know every every every every situation is so different 

522.84 523.92 A: mhm 

523.82 525.01 B: (( so )) 

524.97 531.17 A: and like here in l._a. there's quite a few hospitals that are that are gonna close if they don't get uh federal funding 

531.20 538.86 A: one in particular that i had to go to a long time ago is called rancho los amigos and it's a hospital for people with spinal injuries 

538.24 539.53 B: oh my god 

539.06 553.92 A: and uh it's a county run hospital but you know they also get money from other sources and now all of a sudden they're talking about closing it and people are trying to rally to keep it open and trying to get celebrities and anybody that might wanna uh take it over 

552.39 554.56 B: oh my god 

553.98 561.47 A: and i'd hate to see it go too because like i'm i'm walking and talking now but when i was there it was really iffy as to whether or not i was gonna be able to 

560.93 563.40 B: right do you mind if i ask what happened 

562.78 569.74 A: yeah i was in a car accident and i was a passenger and i wound up with uh a fracture in my spine 

564.55 566.09 B: oh my god 

569.04 571.27 B: [mn] aye yay yay 

570.65 581.55 A: so i had to be sent there to for rehabilitation and they had to operate and do all that stuff but my situation turned out a lot better than some some people wind up in that halo traction you know 

580.87 582.52 B: (( oh god )) 

581.62 584.37 A: and even if they heal they may not walk 

583.82 585.82 B: oh my god 

584.92 591.85 A: so it's kind of like that they should be putting money into that i mean if they can give billions of dollars to iraq they can keep some of these hospitals open 

591.09 594.59 B: i i agree i agree i totally agree 

594.32 599.89 A: you know and the homelessness here as well as here san francisco it's kind of out of control around the summer time
