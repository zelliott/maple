231.75 233.31 B: [cough] i have to say 

233.90 237.76 B: [lipsmack] i don't think we've ever really had a fourth of july [laughter] tradition 

238.52 239.33 A: (( [noise] well )) 

238.57 239.83 B: (( [cough] )) 

239.85 253.10 A: my son in law doesn't ah he was from a small town not near a large town in pennsylvania and [sigh] he um they they just didn't have much going on ever [sigh] um and so 

239.89 240.77 B: um 

253.54 257.78 A: we introduced him [laughter] to the festivities last year [laughter] [laughter] 

257.51 260.77 B: yeah [laughter] well i guess 

258.88 260.77 A: (( it's just it's a lot of fun )) 

262.12 268.09 B: an- and it's really unusual because one of the clearest memories i have of my 

268.38 271.83 B: my father um who passed away when i was ten 

272.06 275.82 B: um is actually going to the fireworks with him [noise] but 

275.29 276.48 A: oh 

276.38 277.48 B: um 

277.93 279.18 A: (( that's sad )) 

278.25 281.60 B: i just [mn] it it's never been 

281.85 289.27 B: a big deal when my kids were little and i was still married to their father we lived in southern california 

283.00 283.89 A: uh-huh 

289.58 296.27 B: and we i i guess the tradition was we went to the beach every year 'cause they always had the fireworks off the pier 

295.96 297.57 A: wow that would be fun 

296.39 296.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

297.51 310.24 B: and i hated it and it ah was like all day long you [sigh] if if the kids went in the water the the waves were too strong and they'd get knocked over because they were real little then and 

309.40 310.52 A: uh-huh 

310.20 317.64 B: you know you had to worry about sunscreen constantly 'cause they were real little and would get burnt to a crisp and knock 'em flat 

317.71 318.80 A: [laughter] 

318.20 319.72 B: and um 

319.81 328.22 B: it was just always so much work and i've never liked the beach sand gets places that i honestly don't believe god ever intended sand to be [sigh] 

326.65 327.40 A: i 

327.82 339.51 A: i don't either i don't either i i just my m- kids we live in oklahoma so we do have lots of bodies of water but you know to have a bona fide beach you know it's [sigh] 

328.98 330.02 B: [laughter] 

339.00 339.91 B: uh-huh 

339.81 348.46 A: and i don't like to plan vacations there [sigh] and so they're always asking me you know i just want to live on the beach or i want [laughter] you know 

348.47 350.87 A: go and you go [laughter] you go [laughter] 

349.37 354.71 B: i like looking at the ocean but going down and getting in it is nothing to me [laughter] 

351.39 352.35 A: uh-huh 

352.89 361.65 A: [laughter] it's not and there's all sorts of things fly floating around in there [laughter] swimming around yeah so i'm just 

358.27 360.08 B: [laughter] 

361.15 365.97 B: an- and i can't blame it on jaws anymore but [laughter] 

363.76 365.93 A: yeah really really 

366.06 368.95 A: so if we wer- if you were to create 

366.31 367.28 B: [laughter] 

369.25 371.35 A: (( a um holiday [cough] )) 

372.31 373.73 A: (( what would you create )) 

375.72 376.78 B: um 

378.91 382.31 B: well i don't really know there 

383.12 389.17 B: i'd like to see a lot more emphasis put on veterans' day but that's not creating a holiday 

388.86 393.64 A: well it's i like that idea though that's creating [sigh] um 

393.67 395.13 A: something [laughter] 

395.35 398.27 A: much more than what we have now right [laughter] 

397.86 399.69 B: oh yeah i mean 

399.76 402.03 B: i i think anymore 

403.22 408.68 B: i i think our country used to be really focused on its history and where it came from an- 

408.25 409.56 A: (( yeah uh-hum uh-hum )) 

408.78 416.98 B: and the melting plot melting pot concept [sigh] ah maybe it's a melting plot too i know [laughter] [laughter] um 

415.42 416.27 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

417.13 418.16 B: um 

418.61 423.33 B: and i think we've lost an enormous sense of our history [sigh] 

423.19 424.55 A: (( yeah uh-hum uh-hum uh-hum )) 

424.21 428.77 B: um we've become such a microwave society that 

429.29 433.15 B: ah you know people forget where you came from [noise] 

433.21 434.13 A: (( yeah uh-hum )) 

433.42 437.84 B: when when i was a kid one of the things my mom would always say 

438.04 442.94 B: and i still say to my kids when they leave the house remember who you belong to 

443.34 444.05 A: (( uh-hum )) 

443.43 444.83 B: and um 

445.76 447.43 B: (( you you know to )) 

447.81 449.35 B: promote that 

449.63 455.81 B: sense of family that you belong to you you're part of a a larger whole 

455.89 458.01 A: (( yeah well you know )) 

456.82 458.18 B: (( and )) 

458.10 472.08 A: i think that that probably that's part of why i like our fourth of july so much it's celebration here it's because there is a strong emphasis in the parade on the veterans 

472.03 473.01 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

472.08 480.72 A: [sigh] you know and it does bring up [sigh] especially when the kids were younger talking about [sigh] the founding of our country an- and ah 

481.16 483.25 A: we always have um 

483.68 486.34 A: ah people [sigh] re-enact 

486.55 493.71 A: or in the costumes on horses um from the civil war both sides and um 

492.59 494.01 B: [noise] right 

493.88 495.90 A: we have um ah 

496.25 507.26 A: a drum is it i think it's drum and fife corps you know from the revolutionary war yeah and they um they're always walking in the period costumes and 

499.54 501.61 B: uh-hum drum and fife 

502.03 502.97 B: yeah 

506.53 510.99 B: yeah i'm not too far away from you i'm up in kansas i live in the wichita area 

509.26 512.40 A: so yeah yeah and and 

511.36 512.37 B: yeah 

512.47 518.06 A: so that's pretty neat because it it does foster that you know for us um 

518.57 527.76 A: but you know maybe they needed to do more combining of the two the veterans' day and [sigh] fourth of july and really stress that um 

528.40 532.56 B: i i just i feel like the the country has lost 

532.47 544.78 B: [sigh] and maybe with this last war and so on there there's more of a fostering of it then there ever was but it was like after the vietnam war and and that kind of stuff [sigh] 

544.78 547.79 B: people became almost ashamed 

547.52 548.32 A: (( fact uh-hum )) 

548.09 549.82 B: if they were a veteran [noise] 

550.42 551.65 B: and 

552.58 554.21 B: [sigh] you know

564.33 565.55 B: and 

567.67 568.99 B: you know um 

570.05 575.78 B: my brother talked about how it was really difficult for him after desert storm because [noise] 

576.63 581.08 B: ah nobody acted like that when they came home from vietnam [noise] and um 

582.93 585.81 B: you know i i i really felt for 

588.02 589.23 B: (( him because )) 

589.70 594.78 B: wherever you go if you're following ah a larger call 

595.24 598.53 B: um something above your own selfish interests
