3.26 4.17 B: hi 

4.52 7.68 A: hi [laughter] so the topic of the day is 

5.90 10.29 B: i missed half of the topic yeah 'cause my phone is going in and out [laughter] 

9.69 15.44 A: yeah like it's holiday uh like what um what's our favorite holiday and why 

11.23 12.15 B: okay 

13.42 14.58 B: in general 

16.28 18.06 B: okay yes 

16.62 17.51 A: rachel 

17.95 19.62 A: (( oh okay i didn't know if you were still there )) 

19.09 21.46 B: yeah favorite holiday they said 

21.43 27.23 A: yeah i guess the first part about it was what's our first fav- er what's our favorite holiday and why 

28.13 29.97 B: okay do you wanna go first or 

29.92 32.32 A: [laughter] no you go first 

30.97 32.92 B: (( [laughter] oh okay um )) 

32.33 33.04 A: [laughter] 

33.41 35.77 B: m favorite holiday is 

36.64 38.13 B: (( i don't know i guess christmas )) 

38.58 40.25 A: okay why [mn] 

39.05 40.19 B: and 

40.89 51.40 B: just because i think like my family didn't do much for it when i was younger [laughter] so now that i'm older and i do m- like it's a much more festive season so it's kinda like i'm in control of the christmas i wanted 

51.56 52.98 B: so i guess that 

53.86 57.27 B: i don't know [laughter] i'm not a big holiday person 

57.00 64.85 A: [laughter] me neither but i guess if i had to pick my favorite holiday it would be probably saint patrick's day 

64.54 66.66 B: really so you're irish 

66.01 74.88 A: yeah not at all but on saint patrick's day i tend to uh go to a lot of irish pubs and drink a lot of green beer 

68.20 69.86 B: really [laughter] 

74.59 75.88 B: [laughter] 

76.06 83.82 A: yeah no basically i'm from detroit and for some reason it's just that has become like a huge huge thing there 

83.44 85.54 B: are there are a lot of irish people in detroit 

83.86 84.66 A: where 

86.34 98.56 A: um i don't think so but for some reason everybody just kinda tends to start early in the morning at seven o'clock and start drinking green beer all the way through and it it's just one giant party throughout the whole city 

98.40 99.56 B: see that's funny 

98.77 100.91 A: like everybody takes off from work 

100.68 111.29 B: [mn] yeah 'cause i'm in new york where there's a ton of irish people and people can't take off from work like if anything it's the weekend closest you go out to beers uh to bars but they don't even do green beer anymore 

111.42 114.19 B: so that's really funny that detroit's like kinda run with it 

111.48 112.33 A: yeah 

114.30 115.57 B: [laughter] 

115.18 121.30 A: that's i i hated i mean i'm out in l._a. now but [laughter] uh [laughter] 

119.23 120.25 B: oh 

121.41 123.60 A: yeah we're on opposite ends of the coast 

123.02 124.13 B: [laughter] 

124.11 137.76 A: but uh yeah back when i was in detroit that was that was probably my favorite holiday and that's why but it it's just there was a big huge party that the whole entire city seemed to celebrate and that's you know i like things like that 

137.22 138.88 B: right well that sounds cool 

139.20 140.96 A: you have that in new york everyday 

141.49 144.36 B: um no i don't think so 

143.04 144.18 A: [laughter] 

144.43 153.28 B: i don't know i think new york's kind of like overrated [laughter] as this party and like exciting place and people come together but i don't think it's like that as much anymore 

154.01 156.09 A: hm well 

156.22 158.16 B: okay so is that what 

156.28 158.00 A: (( you have to change that )) 

158.13 168.16 A: you have to change that [laughter] now anyways the second part of the theme that we had was um we had if we could create our own holiday 

159.38 160.49 B: (( [laughter] )) 

168.81 171.34 A: what would it be or something like that 

171.21 174.26 B: okay this is like a college application essay topic 

173.57 176.41 A: i know yeah it seems like that 

174.99 181.00 B: [laughter] [laughter] like yesterday i got one completely current event and this one's kinda goofy um 

182.22 183.21 B: yeah 

183.44 185.08 B: hm [laughter] 

184.24 187.47 A: so what would be your creat- created holiday 

187.01 189.42 B: (( [mn] um [lipsmack] )) 

189.44 191.08 B: (( i'm not really sure )) 

191.24 192.93 B: um [laughter] let's see 

194.57 195.56 A: [laughter] 

195.58 197.54 B: yeah [laughter] 

196.85 198.76 A: [laughter] 

201.05 204.51 A: don't look for me to fill in because i'm just as stumped as you 

201.89 209.98 B: [laughter] i mean i think hallmark has already created every holiday you know [laughter] i don't know if there's any left [laughter] um 

206.31 207.31 A: i know 

209.40 212.75 A: i know it seems like there's a holiday every week or something 

211.90 221.40 B: there really is 'cause i used to teach and they'd give you this calendar of like so you could celebrate everything with your kids so they'd have this worldly thing and if you really start looking into 

221.31 228.07 B: secretary day and ice cream week there's really a holiday everyday [laughter] designated by some organization 

228.44 229.44 B: um 

230.32 232.65 B: let's see if i could do a holiday 

232.54 236.38 A: that's hard for either one of us 'cause neither one of us are holiday people 

235.97 243.89 B: yeah i mean i guess like wh- it would be completely non secular so everybody could actually celebrate and nobody would be left out 

243.30 244.31 A: (( uh-huh )) 

244.18 244.90 B: hm 

245.40 246.49 A: okay 

246.39 252.38 B: it's kind of hard because if you're doing it in honor of an occasion it's probably already [laughter] been invented [mn] 

252.54 253.50 B: so 

253.53 254.42 B: (( uh )) 

255.51 259.87 A: i it it's like for like you know you said they've all been done they're all there 

259.25 260.29 B: yeah 

260.42 262.46 A: so i don't know i mean um 

263.74 269.51 A: definitely for me it'd be something where it's definitely a party a celebration for everybody 

269.13 270.02 B: right 

271.24 272.14 A: (( you know )) 

272.22 275.25 A: i kinda tend to take part in everybody's holidays 

274.61 278.28 B: [laughter] anything to drink and have fun [laughter] 

275.43 276.66 A: (( [laughter] it's )) 

277.39 280.93 A: g- exactly cinco de mayo coming up on monday 

279.96 284.45 B: [laughter] god do you have that in your l- ta- uh circled on your calendar [mn] 

284.31 285.69 A: oh yeah 

285.10 286.12 B: um 

289.32 290.59 A: (( hm it's a )) 

289.45 297.10 B: yeah maybe it'd be nice if there was like a stay in bed day where you just kinda [laughter] stay in bed all day and then wake up late and go out [mn] 

294.87 296.18 A: there you go 

296.68 308.94 A: i -s okay y- i went to camp up in canada and we had this thing called the z machine whenever it was raining yeah and y- that's exactly what we did we'd stay in the cabin and just you know read comic books whatever 

308.82 310.17 B: oh that's pretty neat 

309.16 310.66 A: play cards 

310.67 315.95 B: yeah like 'cause you know people don't take enough leisure time so maybe it would be a forced leisure time holiday 

316.03 325.15 A: there we go z machine holiday [laughter] just everybody just sits chills with the family just really doesn't do much of anything 

317.35 319.05 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

325.55 331.68 B: right you know make sure all those workaholic dads and moms stay home with their kids for a day and [laughter] 

330.75 336.31 A: exactly just no business nothing just the whole country just kinda 

334.98 340.20 B: you know the phone company would shut down phone service [laughter] you can't be interrupted 

338.40 346.07 A: exactly no phone calls no nothing [laughter] no emergencies no hospitals 

342.21 343.25 B: [laughter] 

345.25 350.29 B: [laughter] [laughter] so true i mean what could really happen if everyone's in bed [laughter] 

346.84 348.32 A: [laughter] 

349.67 353.99 A: [mn] yeah just just everybody just stays at home and does nothing 

353.62 354.73 B: [laughter] 

354.52 357.15 A: and then we can deal with everything the next day 

357.19 363.32 B: yeah [laughter] you know if your bills were due they're not that day [laughter] it's stay in bed day 

357.33 360.39 A: [laughter] don't think it would work but 

361.71 362.45 A: nope 

363.65 365.62 A: stay in bed day there we go 

366.06 371.87 A: ah again i sh- although i know a lot of people who take that as a personal holiday 

366.24 367.30 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

373.74 375.37 B: wait what do you mean in what way [noise] 

375.81 380.27 A: in other words where they just no you know i'm not going into work today i'm just going to lay in bed all day 

379.65 391.50 B: oh yeah like the mental health days [laughter] see but you have to lie usually when you're taking a mental health day [laughter] so this is you know promoting honesty in your staying in bed [laughter] there's nothing to be ashamed of for staying in bed all day 

391.51 396.24 A: wait wait wait you actually have a mental health day as part of work 

394.70 405.18 B: well no people call it like oh yeah i'm gonna have to just take a mental health day but they don't really have it that's what i'm saying is that they have to lie about being sick but if you're just burnt out and you know like what you're saying like you just want to take a personal day 

400.02 400.77 A: oh 

405.28 409.18 B: like a lot of jobs don't really have personal days where you don't say what's wrong with 

409.24 410.97 B: or why you need to take it 

411.62 412.71 A: ouch 

412.31 414.76 B: yeah there's a lot of that now 

414.98 416.17 A: (( ouch )) 

415.31 417.66 B: they're getting like strict with days off 

417.77 425.42 A: yeah well luckily i don't work for a big corporation so i don't i basically well i can take off whenever i feel like it yup 

425.43 428.40 B: but so you work for like a small company that they don't care 

428.47 434.02 A: well i kinda part time work for small company then i have my own company as well 

429.43 430.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

433.13 440.54 B: oh so your own company that's the difference [laughter] then you can do whatever you want as long as you get things done 

435.74 436.44 A: (( yes )) 

440.68 448.80 A: although my sister works for for um is it blackstone or blackrock i can't remember which company in new york black 

449.26 451.94 A: i don't know one of those two companies 

451.46 453.06 B: okay [laughter] 

452.80 457.59 A: and she seems to be taking a lot of days off whenever she feels like it 

457.80 461.26 B: ah she must be high up or they're not paying her for them 

461.68 469.56 A: [laughter] no neither nor she makes a good salary but she's not that high up but for some reason i don't know i guess she's just too cute to say no to 

462.20 463.13 B: (( really )) 

469.26 470.59 B: [laughter] 

470.75 474.70 A: but yeah she makes her own little personal holidays as she goes [laughter] 

474.37 475.62 B: that's funny 

476.26 478.11 A: yeah but mm 

478.30 483.45 A: [laughter] you know as far as the holidays go like i don't know i'd rather be working 

483.51 484.62 B: really 

484.51 485.83 A: yeah 

485.85 497.17 B: yeah see not so much here [laughter] actually though like right now i just got laid off so i'm unemployed and a- actually now i'd rather be working but [laughter] uh once i have the job it kinda would be nice to have a holiday like once a week 

488.19 489.09 A: no 

497.65 499.73 A: yeah 

499.01 501.09 B: just to have that mandatory day off 

501.40 509.52 A: yeah for me it's like you know i would love a few hours off here and there when i you know wanna do something but otherwise i don't mind working seven days a week 

509.73 513.50 B: [noise] see that's 'cause you're you're in your own i think working for yourself 

513.92 522.63 B: i don't know everyone i know who's working for themselves and you know they see like by working i'm really moving somewhere and getting something it's i think a lot more gratifying 

514.40 515.09 A: (( yes )) 

522.94 524.53 B: a position to be in 

523.30 525.14 A: yeah well 

525.24 529.33 A: (( [mn] except when you've got all the bills that have to get paid so it's [laughter] )) 

528.33 531.63 B: that's true so you feel a little more pressure [laughter] 

530.64 532.77 A: ye- oh there's a lot more pressure 

533.10 536.99 A: definitely but you know hey whatever whatever it is it is 

536.67 538.36 B: so you live in l._a. now 

538.40 540.30 A: yeah 

539.33 541.73 B: oh probably warm there 

540.55 542.12 A: yeah 

542.18 547.38 A: ah except for today er last night it was raining today it was raining but it'll be warm from here on in 

547.67 548.83 B: that's good 

548.60 550.59 A: they've promised me that 

550.07 553.32 B: oh have they you and the meteorologists have a special deal going 

553.50 554.47 B: [laughter] 

553.61 554.45 A: yup 

555.46 563.42 A: no but even even when it's raining it's still so nice out here just you have that difference between you've got the city and then the mountains right there 

562.99 565.11 B: right yeah i like california 

563.91 565.25 A: and then the ocean 

567.48 568.32 B: (( hello )) 

567.67 570.01 A: it's just so cool all three of them right there 

569.87 571.01 B: yeah 

571.51 575.60 B: that's what i like there and you can see it the mountains from almost you know once you get 

575.62 583.80 B: a like i was in the valley for a while just like staying there with people for a f- like for about three weeks and you just look to one side and you see mountains and 

577.85 578.73 A: (( uh-huh )) 

584.29 586.69 B: even when you're near the highway it's kinda nice 

586.72 587.45 A: (( yes )) 

587.82 589.70 B: new york is very 

587.93 588.78 A: (( all these )) 

590.10 593.96 B: different [laughter] i think than california like the pace and everything 

593.98 596.35 B: like i think people are a lot more friendly there 

596.69 598.57 A: they are they really are 

597.36 599.89 B: yeah people look at you in the eye when you're walking
