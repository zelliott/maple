28.32 29.90 B: yeah i [laughter] 

30.90 36.11 B: why is it my favorite i don't know i guess probably 'cause family gets together that's probably 

37.32 41.54 B: why i like it best why do you like spring break best 

41.44 43.66 A: [laughter] um 

43.49 44.84 B: [laughter] 

44.11 55.55 A: i like spring break because you know you get to look forward to meeting new people because wherever you go everyone's in that festive mood of just getting loud and crazy 

54.83 56.26 B: oh yeah [laughter] [noise] 

55.58 61.21 A: um [laughter] and it's probably not a holiday i mean if that's not considered a holiday 

61.16 70.33 A: i'd go for thanksgiving because like i mean with christmas you just have such high expectations like you're always disappointed in the end [laughter] and with thanksgiving 

68.34 69.30 B: yeah 

70.28 84.20 A: it's just it always amazes me with how many people come together and even if my family decides like my family rarely ever celebrates thanksgiving like the only turkey they get there's like one that somebody else gives us for free 

84.25 92.82 A: like hey you guys don't have a turkey then it's like when it comes to my friends they always invite me to their family things and i just feel the love 

92.83 94.81 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] [laughter] [mn] yeah we usually )) 

95.01 108.48 B: try to get the kids together and we always cook a huge meal [mn] and then if it's just um my fiance and i then we we still do a turkey big turkey the whole nine yards so 

108.53 115.51 B: if we can't make it and i did get to travel back to see my family for thanksgiving this year so that was fun so 

113.98 115.39 A: (( mm [noise] [mn] hu- )) 

115.64 118.81 B: it's really always a special time so 

119.15 122.63 B: so if you could create a holiday [laughter] [laughter] 

122.17 125.57 A: oh yeah that question oh gosh 

126.03 131.60 A: you know what are there any holidays that celebrate you know birth or children 

133.31 134.40 B: uh 

133.57 134.50 A: 'cause it 

135.05 139.62 B: not really just [mn] individual birthdays i think probably so 

138.95 139.71 A: (( [mn] hm )) 

140.21 147.76 A: maybe we need a holiday for the gift of life or something [laughter] that's the only one i can think of 

145.11 146.40 B: that'd be a good one [noise] 

148.21 154.56 A: or maybe like you know another group that's ignored like pets a pet holiday [laughter] 

154.08 155.88 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

156.24 163.29 B: okay i think if i created one it would be maybe a no holiday holiday or a a no reason 

162.47 163.81 A: (( oh god [mn] )) 

163.67 169.27 B: a no reason everyone gets the day off work well you can't have that though can you

197.21 199.17 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

197.64 203.86 B: that's how i would celebrate it and just not have to do anything i think just be a 

204.49 209.22 B: plain old day where you have the day off no obligations no 

209.74 213.20 B: [mn] you know no need to cook huge meals [noise] or

217.31 221.84 A: what do you think is an ideal length for a holiday i mean 

222.36 226.94 A: would it be crazy to have a two week holiday [laughter] that we made [laughter] it

240.71 242.34 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

241.24 254.78 A: i totally assumed that everybody 'cause i [mn] this is my third time and like the first two times they were from the east coast so by now i don't even ask i just assumed that they were recruiting people only over there 

248.73 249.95 B: oh yeah [noise] 

254.45 268.13 B: yeah i'd i we live so close to canada that um canada has a lot of holidays [laughter] i don't know if you've ever noticed that but they really do they go in for three day weekends all the time

268.82 272.56 B: so they really got the holiday thing down [laughter] 

272.82 274.60 A: [laughter] they have it down pat 

274.38 275.90 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

275.36 285.96 A: i went um to europe and i was just you know i was i think that the whole work pace over there is completely different because 

286.14 290.89 A: i saw shops closing in the middle of the day it was like two p._m. 

290.79 291.56 A: and 

291.43 297.20 A: and it and it it was like italy and france the the shops are just closed in the middle of the day 

297.01 310.09 A: and i just thought that is so cool and i guess they open up maybe like it's from twelve to three or from twelve to four they just close it for and um i just thought maybe we didn't we wouldn't need as many holidays if 

310.31 312.97 A: if we had a schedule like that i 

313.73 314.80 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah that's ))

317.40 318.37 B: (( yeah i know )) 

322.12 324.52 B: yeah well [mn] 

324.73 337.63 B: in my experience i th- i think as you get out there and work y- you buy more stuff and even if you get a raise then you buy [noise] more stuff and you're constantly going in circles [laughter] 

334.13 335.21 A: (( oh yeah ))
