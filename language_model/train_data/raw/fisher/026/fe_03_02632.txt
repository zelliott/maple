14.78 16.57 B: yeah great [laughter] 

15.91 17.25 A: [laughter] 

16.93 19.42 B: so we're gonna talk about iraq ha 

19.08 21.72 A: yeah this one's a loaded question man 

20.83 25.00 B: really i'm so glad it seems like the end is near [sigh] 

21.91 23.11 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

25.00 32.38 A: yeah um this is a tough one because you never know who you're gonna talk to because everyone has such extreme views but 

26.45 27.03 B: (( ah )) 

31.84 33.57 B: well i'm not radical 

33.35 35.57 A: [laughter] that's good to hear 

35.44 40.07 B: i'm i think i tend to be more conservative but first i was real 

40.61 51.98 B: [sigh] real worried about going there at all you know without more support from the united nations but i'm glad we did go and i'm glad it's turned out the way it has 

52.11 60.70 B: [sigh] um it seems like we minimized [sigh] the amount of damage and the amount of deaths as much as possible 

61.04 67.85 B: [sigh] and i i think maybe it was necessary i i don't know if we can ever be sure we have to kinda trust 

67.98 74.23 B: [sigh] those in charge you know that's what we elected them for although i didn't vote for 'em but ah [laughter] 

73.27 74.66 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

75.55 76.92 B: (( you know ah )) 

77.10 79.63 B: i don't know it it's it is tough 

79.57 84.59 A: i yeah i'm with you completely on that i also did not vote [laughter] for him but um 

84.86 92.25 A: but like you said it's it's about putting your faith that they know something we don't or or an' that they're capable of doing what they need to do 

92.06 93.39 B: yeah i g- 

92.49 93.72 A: i mean obviously 

93.94 101.77 A: i i agree with you though we didn't have the support there are a lot of unanswered questions a lot of ulterior motives and and you know 

101.80 102.92 B: yeah i 

102.00 108.43 A: i feel like they just kept changing their idea of why we were going in different excuse every time 

106.71 107.63 B: yeah 

108.51 118.65 B: well you know i get kind of um worried about the press and people who are commenting on what's going on about how can they be so sure 

118.89 130.21 B: [sigh] i mean we don't have all the facts and i'm sure [sigh] that a lot of things can't be told to us because [sigh] it in this day and age of of news media 

118.91 120.00 A: right 

130.01 140.68 B: everything travels so quickly [sigh] so you can't reveal your hand [sigh] so i i think yeah it just it just came down to trust that [sigh] we had to wait and see [sigh] 

132.29 133.30 A: yeah 

139.42 146.92 A: yeah you never know because i i subscribe to newsweek and every week for the past three months they've been outlining the war plan 

147.09 148.02 B: yeah 

147.11 149.34 A: (( and you have to assume that you know )) 

149.39 155.46 A: um you turn on the news and they're saying we're going through this route and we're using these missiles and 

154.40 162.69 B: i know and i really don't care about all that stuff i only care that [sigh] that the most people as possible come back alive 

162.58 163.88 A: exactly 

163.45 166.01 B: do you have any family members in the service 

165.72 172.29 A: i i do have one and um it it actually makes me very very angry that people are 

167.50 168.36 B: yeah 

172.78 180.09 A: so quick to condemn people for speaking out because i i support our troops very much so and i want them to be safe and 

179.43 180.48 B: yes 

180.26 184.56 A: and i think you know the sacrifices their families make by you know 

184.18 185.80 B: oh i know i saw 

184.96 191.27 A: with them out there i i i can't i can't imagine that kind of selflessness but at the same time it doesn't mean i have ta 

191.39 195.68 A: you know blindly follow and not question what's going on 

194.45 200.29 B: right well you have to keep reminding yourself i as i do that everybody has the right to their opinion 

200.21 202.27 A: right and 

200.48 204.15 B: [sigh] and i may not agree with them but that's still their right 

202.42 203.67 A: exactly 

204.02 215.14 A: yeah so i w- i was pleasantly surprised that it you know it went the way it did but then again who knows what the consequences are it will be a long time before we know 

210.17 210.99 B: (( yeah )) 

213.20 214.17 B: really it 

215.17 223.90 B: yeah [sigh] yeah i hope i suppose we'll be over there for a long time yet [sigh] and i suppose that it's it is going to cost us money 

223.82 224.80 A: oh yes 

224.17 236.10 B: but then they keep finding so much wealth that the the people who were in charge had i think that the that wealth should be converted to pay for all the transition 

236.13 239.38 B: [sigh] i don't think we should have to foot the bill for everything 

236.24 237.40 A: i agree 

240.30 245.77 A: and i definitely think we need to repair relationships and and ah 

244.81 246.12 B: yeah 

246.03 251.21 A: i don't know i don't know if we had the right p._r. guy because [laughter] we do [laughter] 

248.85 250.55 B: right [laughter] 

251.38 256.84 B: well it's it is hard to think that so many people hate us that that's hard to accept 

251.78 252.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

255.20 269.74 A: yeah and and we we did exactly what they expected us to do and and and we kind of acted like a bully ta everyone else and it's going to be tough to you know this whole question about liberation versus occupation 

269.35 270.30 B: right 

269.94 271.99 A: you know this is where our true 

270.66 276.00 B: and and yet i look at it and i think well maybe maybe we needed a bully 

276.16 279.14 B: maybe that's what it took i maybe other people 

276.21 277.21 A: right 

277.94 280.97 A: yeah i think it's long time i mean we 

281.07 290.41 A: i think the u._s. has a history of of supporting people when they need to you know when it's convenient for them and and we helped saddam hussein at one point and 

284.81 285.74 B: yeah 

289.57 303.44 B: you have to laugh how france and germany now are are all of a sudden oh yeah well maybe yeah [laughter] except i do have to laugh too when ah in in minnesota here there was talk just t- the last couple of days about about 

292.52 293.94 A: oh i know 

294.98 295.96 A: [laughter] 

303.49 311.13 B: renaming anything french and i know they've done that in some places but come on that's pretty stupid [laughter] i mean [laughter] 

306.19 307.26 A: (( yeah )) 

309.84 315.23 A: exactly and it's just it's not the image i it's not what feel you know i don't wanna 

312.95 313.93 B: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

313.95 324.99 B: french fries are always going to be french fries just [laughter] give it a rest [laughter] [laughter] ah that's such a silly little n- nothing thing that people focus on 

316.48 320.13 A: right freedom fries and [laughter] 

322.93 335.78 A: right and it makes us it makes us look petty and and you know this now that we've done you know what we did with [noise] the success that we did i think now's the time for true compassion and and working together 

326.69 327.68 B: really 

335.70 336.72 B: yes 

336.03 341.53 A: and saying look you know this is for the greater good no matter what other people 

339.98 343.59 B: well i think if we could see some things that the soldiers have seen 

344.01 350.20 B: that we'd probably all change our minds and you know be convinced of of what was you know what was you know 

344.44 345.42 A: yeah 

350.20 352.07 A: well we're so isolated 

350.22 352.14 B: what was right and what was wrong 

352.21 358.16 A: i mean i wish i could see i wish i had like european television or at least some other form of of 

358.68 360.36 A: news coming at me 

358.75 364.03 B: i know i sometimes wonder if we're getting the whole story or if it's slanted or you know 

362.02 363.43 A: right 

363.84 371.26 A: our version is the wrapped in a bow you know they say oh two americans were killed today a- and we slaughtered a bunch of iraqis but you know 

370.14 371.14 B: yeah 

371.42 381.20 B: and then again i'm sure that that the iraqi people are being told what what their [sigh] media people think they should be told you know 

381.16 382.34 A: definitely 

381.37 389.32 B: just as we're probably being told what what we what the u._s. um news people think we should be told i don't know 

388.50 389.37 A: (( uh-huh [cough] )) 

390.16 398.10 B: [sigh] oh it's hard to understand and sift through all the junk i stopped reading a lot of it and i stopped watching a lot of it 'cause it was just overload [sigh] 

397.92 399.53 A: (( me too it's just )) 

399.77 401.61 A: too much and 

400.93 404.60 B: yeah do you ever watch david letterman or jay leno's show 

403.97 406.09 A: yeah yeah all the time 

404.91 415.67 B: you know i get kind of nervous [laughter] when they start making all the political jokes and i i wonder if other countries see some of that stuff what they must think [sigh] they must think we're pretty flippant [sigh] 

413.44 414.49 A: (( right )) 

416.13 423.04 A: exactly they they i you know they think we're cocky an- and that we think we can do anything we want an and we'll see now 

421.76 424.59 B: and we're just as human as everybody else 

424.38 425.89 A: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

425.90 435.30 A: but now you never know what is going to happen with other countries if if we say hey we we're threatened by you so we're going to invade you you know what's to stop other people from doing the same so 

432.23 433.18 B: right 

434.80 439.90 B: i know i don't want to be seen as as the country that's the big bully of the whole world 

435.71 436.81 A: (( it's tough )) 

439.33 445.71 A: right right we have a real chance to to be like a helper which is what we want to do is 

445.30 453.04 B: right and as far as disarming iraq i think they mentioned that we were supposed to discuss that too i aren't we doing that i mean 

453.31 454.67 A: [laughter] i don't know 

453.39 459.88 B: i think we are i think anything they find they're collecting and i don't think they're just going to give it right back to the iraqi people 

459.86 470.99 A: right but then again they they've shown like stockpiles of weapons that the u._s. tried to destroy but [cough] ended up going off and killing you know innocent people in towns 

460.43 461.64 B: i have to laugh 

469.85 472.41 B: oh yuk i didn't even see that 

472.39 473.66 A: (( [cough] yeah [laughter] )) 

472.53 473.07 B: (( are ))

507.28 510.45 B: [sigh] ah about something about the weapons 

511.76 523.05 B: oh i know it's about the people who used to be in iraq who have now gone back to their country an- and are just kind of taking over 

523.24 530.09 B: [sigh] you know i wonder who these people are that they think they can do that maybe they are someone 

524.24 525.17 A: right 

530.11 535.21 B: trustworthy and of good intentions but i kinda 

533.67 534.39 A: (( [cough] ))

540.17 541.28 A: (( right ))

552.29 553.26 B: yeah 

554.39 563.29 B: [sigh] well yeah i i i think i think the united na- well i don't know if i trust the united nations anymore but [sigh] some some governing

566.44 567.44 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

572.39 576.03 B: [sigh] i still wonder if there are some 

576.10 583.07 B: of saddam's people or saddam and his sons themselves who will still try to take over again once 

583.18 586.31 B: the u._s. or whoever else pulls out 

586.12 587.15 A: right 

587.04 589.70 B: [sigh] i mean they still haven't found them for sure have they

590.36 592.42 B: not as far as i've heard anyway 

592.75 597.51 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] oh dear [sigh] there's always something to worry about

597.11 599.89 A: [cough] so many questions not enough answers
