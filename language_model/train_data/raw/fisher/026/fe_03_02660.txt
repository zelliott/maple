116.13 130.86 A: i guess my favorite holiday would be hm friendship day you know it's not celebrated as much as christmas or new years' day and even new years' day i like the renewal of friendships and the renewal of 

125.56 126.44 B: right 

131.53 137.71 A: old friends and the gathering of new friends so i just combined friendship day with new years' day

361.24 365.01 B: to me a holiday is when i get away from my kids even if it's an hour or so 

365.03 369.47 A: well that's good you know a nice spa a bubble bath uh 

368.74 369.88 B: that's it

383.06 386.55 A: wouldn't that be great [laughter] 

384.56 395.69 B: well we just i'm i'm jewish and my boyfriend's catholic so my second daughter who's three has to do the easter eggs and i have to do the passover so it's very it's tiring [mn] 

392.79 395.44 A: [laughter] you have to do 

395.51 399.25 A: yes you have to do both of them i know i know what you mean 

397.23 401.95 B: yeah and then you have to try explain that you know what the eggs are for and 

401.67 402.92 A: mhm 

402.13 410.88 B: all that stuff and then you have to try and explain passover to them which is even harder to me than to explain the uh easter [laughter] with the easter eggs 

403.38 405.38 A: [laughter] 

409.42 410.49 A: yes 

410.79 419.60 A: i know i'm catholic and my husband's orthodoxy so we celebrate two easters as well 'cause theirs is different but 

415.83 416.89 B: right 

417.54 419.57 B: what's the what's the difference 

419.74 427.32 A: it's um well they go for the jul- go by the julian calender and the catholicism changed the calender from the days of 

427.43 429.63 B: oh so there there's two easters 

427.45 428.63 A: (( juliu- ))

434.22 435.13 B: right 

434.45 438.10 A: (( christian and orthodox which is a- actually very interesting )) 

438.47 444.82 A: i think orthodoxy is a little more tradition than catholicism after growing up catholic i can actually say that [laughter] 

443.66 447.28 B: but it's still the same thing when jesus was resurrected 

446.99 459.09 A: yeah it's the same thing but it's just they have more of a show more of a grandiose to it grandiosity to orthodoxy it's it's actually interesting not knowing about it until i met him 

453.43 454.33 B: okay 

457.87 458.76 B: right 

459.15 460.89 A: so that's always fun 

460.60 471.28 B: well at passover we have to sit down at the table and there's this there's a big meal and you have to take eat um a- all the uh symbols of passover meals that are told at the table each of the foods 

463.26 465.27 A: (( [laughter] )) 

471.14 485.13 B: they're symbolic yeah like there's bitter there's bitter herbs they call that's the bitterness of slavery the matzah which is the unleavened bread 'cause they didn't have time to make leaven bread a bone of lamb to show um some kind of a it's a sacrifice of a lamb
