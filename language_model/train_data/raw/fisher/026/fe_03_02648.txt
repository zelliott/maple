14.17 26.76 A: right [noise] i guess i would probably have to say mine is christmas just because [sigh] it's like a special time of year [lipsmack] and i guess it's the advertising they start it so early any way you got it's in your face you know by um thanksgiving 

27.16 29.37 B: (( [sigh] yeah ah [cough] i )) 

29.60 44.20 B: i i don't like christmas as much as you because as as you said it's too much hype in it [sigh] the advertising hype is started too early [cough] i do like some aspects of the christmas season such as the christmas lights and the remembrance day parade

52.44 60.72 B: tourist season and swimming season and it indicates the [sigh] warmer season because i like warm weather and i dislike cold weather [sigh] how about you 

59.31 60.24 A: right 

60.75 75.52 A: well i in kind of the same thing the fourth of july is really nice then too because it's in the middle of th- the summer and hopefully it doesn't get too hot you know so you can still be outside and be you know not very uncomfortable in the heat and um 

60.84 61.40 B: (( [sigh] )) 

75.51 82.75 A: it's really nice usually because every town has some kind of fireworks and people get together and have picnics so that i think that's nice too 

82.39 84.67 B: [sigh] ah i'm sorry what was your name again karen 

84.56 85.52 A: alison

95.45 96.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

95.67 97.73 A: um just because [sigh] 

97.60 108.84 A: it's ah like a festive time of year and with my family we have a huge um dinner the night before [sigh] and then the next day we see each other on christmas then the next day too so 

108.72 116.97 A: [mn] i'm a college student so i don't see my family a lot so when i do go home for my winter break and it's christmas that's probably again why i really like it 

116.43 122.51 B: [sigh] yeah yes it's a good family holiday and i can see why you you like it [cough] ah 

122.59 123.95 B: (( [cough] again now ah )) 

123.87 138.19 B: which holiday i would create they asked us to stay on the topic so which ah new holiday i would create i have to really [laughter] think hard about that [sigh] ah i'd have to say welcome to spring holiday i just had that creative insight i hope [sigh] ah welcome to spring holiday where ah 

126.97 127.70 A: (( right [noise] right [noise] )) 

138.28 143.55 B: [cough] everyone would ah [sigh] have a big ah outdoor party ah in center of city 

143.88 149.58 B: ah welcoming spring having a few drinks and dancing and ah [sigh] with the mummers 

150.48 151.86 B: (( ah bands )) 

151.81 152.69 A: right 

152.12 158.39 B: and al- all kinds of ah festivities because that's how much i hate the winter and love to welcome the spring [laughter] 

158.17 159.08 A: uh-huh 

159.43 163.80 B: [noise] [cough] so ah do you have a holiday you'd like to create ah alison [sigh] [noise] [sigh] 

163.23 164.83 A: well kind of um 

164.67 171.04 A: working off of what you said i think i don't like um winter either i think it's a cold and kind of bitter but 

170.89 180.30 A: maybe if there was some kind of like welcome to winter [sigh] because a lot of people seem to not like winter that much and if you were to get kind of every town having um 

180.35 188.18 A: kind of like you know hot chocolate and ice skating and then some kind of outdoor activities people might be um 

188.34 196.57 A: you know kind of like maybe [mn] like winter a little bit more since a lot of people don't s- seem to like it as much as spring and summer and i guess fall 

196.21 203.14 B: [noise] i agree with you so i i'm i'm just taking it interpreting it alison as you're saying you would have like a welcome to winter holiday [sigh] 

202.56 203.73 A: right yes 

203.49 210.68 B: that's a good idea and i would enjoy that too because as much as i dislike the winter [sigh] i've heard in other countries such as iceland they have ah [sigh] 

210.66 220.72 B: thermal baths and ah people party in the winter and it's more pleasant than here so i think that's a good idea [sigh] ah make a winter festive holiday i think that's an excellent idea alison ah 

213.75 214.67 A: (( right right )) 

216.05 216.94 A: (( uh-hum )) 

220.98 222.35 B: (( so [cough] )) 

222.45 227.36 B: [sigh] ah so you- your's is a welcoming winter holiday and mine's a welcoming spring holiday 

227.01 228.42 A: [noise] yes [laughter] 

227.80 230.18 B: (( oh i think that's good [sigh] ah )) 

230.23 236.08 B: [cough] now getting back to my favorite holiday memorial day ah again it's coming up soon and ah 

235.88 245.61 B: sometimes it's too chilly to to swim on memorial day but still [sigh] it ah [cough] it's a harbinger of of of the ah warmer weather [sigh] and ah 

245.78 257.49 B: [cough] it's like ah ah an indicator that t- the winter's over and we'll be soon be able to go swimming and picnicking and ah having a couple of beers outside and i like to go to the beach 

251.95 252.78 A: (( [noise] right )) 

256.24 256.80 A: (( mm )) 

257.71 266.70 B: [sigh] in the summer and and there's a certain beach i like to go to in north jersey so memorial day ah is a harbinger of that would you agree with that 

265.19 265.75 A: (( mm )) 

266.06 273.19 A: yes is m- memorial day it's usually is there a specific date or is it the last weekend in may is that what it is 

272.59 286.65 B: yes i think it's the fourth monday in may i'm pretty sure [sigh] it's ah this month it's a one two three [sigh] yeah it's the fourth the congress changed the holiday laws some years ago probably before you were born [laughter] making it on mondays 

275.06 276.27 A: oh right right 

286.66 289.11 B: making most of the holidays on mondays [sigh] 

286.71 287.56 A: (( [laughter] all right [noise] )) 

289.12 292.44 B: so i think it's the fourth monday of the month of may 

293.30 294.27 B: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

293.58 295.23 A: that's it i'm sorry 

294.39 295.43 B: pardon me 

295.60 308.72 A: and also it's good because you know you get a day off summer holidays like um [sigh] valentine's day you don't not as if that's a huge huge holiday but that's um something you don't get off so it's nice to have um the monday off on three day weekends 

308.30 314.83 B: [sigh] yeah but ah in the interests of st- staying on the topic you you you do like you prefer christmas you said right [sigh] 

314.49 315.92 A: yes i do 

315.71 324.95 B: [sigh] and an well a lot of people probably prefer christmas ah because do you enjoy seeing ah christmas lights strung on trees and santa clauses and reindeer etc [sigh] [noise] 

324.97 337.08 A: yes um i really like that i think um [lipsmack] some houses at christmas time will have very just you know like a nice nice wreath wreath or something and sometimes that is a nice that's a little nicer than 

325.09 325.65 B: (( [sigh] )) 

336.96 347.94 A: ah really decked out houses that almost every town seems to have but sometimes it's nicer just to have holly or something plain on the house where it's not very [sigh] gaudy but it's still festive 

347.50 352.87 B: yeah i i i agree with you i agree with you a hundred percent alison i wouldn't like excessive gaudiness no i don't 

351.99 352.82 A: right 

352.70 355.86 B: in fact in my neighborhood [sigh] which is pretty rich a 

355.83 367.80 B: lot of people decorate [sigh] their houses for d- different holidays even valentine's day etc but i want to [sigh] continue on with ah memorial day being my favorite holiday it's difficult these topics are not easy but ah 

361.10 361.70 A: (( yes )) 

364.19 364.87 A: right 

367.77 382.10 B: [cough] [sigh] memorial day's coming soon and of course there's a patriotic element and i'm a veteran of the vietnam war and i'm a patriotic person so ah memorial day honors ah our fallen dead servicemen and women [sigh] [sigh] and that's sort of important to remember don't you think [noise] [noise] 

372.21 373.51 A: (( [laughter] right right )) 

374.11 374.90 A: oh 

381.77 389.15 A: uh-hum yes i think especially if you said this year it'll be [sigh] maybe a little closer now i guess it has been for the last maybe 

388.97 399.11 A: [sigh] since nine eleven which is nice because it's not even it's like a nice time to relax and i think but still you're able to appreciate the people that have um served the country [noise] 

398.40 402.00 B: [noise] [sigh] yeah you have to remember the significance of our holidays ah [sigh] 

402.24 412.59 B: like christmas is jesus' birthday memorial day is honoring our fallen ah armed services members [sigh] and ah it it's it's it's fair let's remember they paid the price 

412.41 417.77 B: ah they they're no long- no longer among the living on this earth and that's a pretty big price to pay don't you think 

412.74 413.47 A: right 

417.58 418.45 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

417.83 432.26 B: [sigh] for freedom and liberty so i think that's ah another reason why memorial day is my [sigh] favorite holiday as far as a holiday i'd create again i have to go back to ah welcoming spring day which actually what day would i make it what date i i guess i would make it ah 

432.97 440.99 B: [sigh] may first may day [laughter] and when when would you ah appoint what day date would you appoint for your ah holiday new holiday alison 

435.27 436.49 A: yeah [laughter] 

440.75 454.96 A: well i think t- the first day of winter is the twenty first usually the twentieth or twenty first [noise] that's very close to christmas so i think maybe with my holiday people wouldn't really [noise] want they would be focusing on christmas as opposed to some other 

444.59 445.41 B: (( uh-hum )) 

445.95 446.79 B: (( uh-hum [noise] [noise] )) 

454.75 457.33 A: different holiday so maybe i would say 

457.43 463.24 A: um december first or it could just be not really a welcome to winter but more of a 

463.19 473.59 A: winter holiday and have it maybe february first because february is such a kind of a dreary month and it's short but still [sigh] very cold and my holiday would be able to 

473.38 478.75 A: help people maybe be a little bit more happy and [sigh] outgoing and meet with um neighbors and friends 

478.34 485.91 B: [sigh] [noise] oh i i couldn't agree with you more an and of course we have to [sigh] you'd have to plan you'd have to start we'd have to start a holiday committee to plan these things 

485.47 486.90 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

485.74 489.20 B: as to the exact appropriate date don't you think alison [sigh] 

488.14 490.08 A: (( oh yes uh-hum )) 

488.98 501.00 B: so this these aren't easy ideas to come up with right away but [sigh] continuing on ah i don't ah trying to think of what other ah festivities we could have when they're welcoming my welcome to spring day which ah 

500.04 500.67 A: (( yes )) 

500.82 514.27 B: [sigh] i would have ah scheduled on may first which used to be called may day i guess it still is ah i guess we could have [cough] [sigh] well i've seen a lot of people go to old city in philadelphia and ah party [sigh] and that would be a good idea 

504.70 505.84 A: (( uh-hum )) 

514.16 515.22 A: (( uh-hum )) 

514.46 520.80 B: and maybe i would have a feature where [sigh] ah single people ah ah should try to meet each other 

520.65 521.54 A: (( uh-hum )) 

520.87 531.41 B: and everyone else married people or people and couples should tr- try to be friendly and meet other people [sigh] as friends [sigh] because sometimes i think ah americans don't meet each other enough and have enough friends [sigh] 

531.16 532.24 A: right 

531.65 533.30 B: (( okay what do you think of that alison )) 

532.99 547.71 A: yeah i think that's a good idea especially since it's starting spring everyone's out more they're working on their lawn or they're out exercising and people just want to get out and interact with more people and your holiday would really help people maybe begin to do that for the season 

547.57 560.26 B: oh i appreciate your input into that and that [sigh] so since christmas is your favorite holiday [sigh] do you stay in i assume you live in the philadelphia area do you stay in your home area alison or do you t- travel to miami or somewhere like that 

559.70 565.70 A: well actually i'm going to college here in philadelphia i live in north jersey so i go home 

564.34 565.13 B: oh 

565.71 574.32 A: um usually my college we get out um around like the fifteenth so i'm home able to start planning for christmas and [sigh] buy my gifts for everyone 

574.49 581.67 B: right yeah well christmas is a very popular holiday and ah ah ah ah sort of an expensive holiday in the united states as people 

580.49 581.09 A: (( right )) 

581.52 590.05 B: most americans spend a lot of money on gifts although i don't spend a a lot of money on gifts because i just don't believe in it i just buy [sigh] a gift for my girlfriend [laughter] and [sigh] 

589.51 590.47 A: (( uh-hum )) 

589.98 598.47 B: send cards to my family members that's all i do i put a wreath up on my door and candles on my in my windows etc do you do any of those things a- alison [sigh] 

594.72 595.46 A: right 

597.89 599.89 A: yes like i i said ah i don't really like
