288.32 289.03 B: (( reb- )) 

291.02 296.26 B: right right and i and i think and the reason i support it is because you know i felt 

296.04 307.70 B: what president bush was saying about the regime over there is that they were oppressing the people [noise] you know and um then they was being killed or poisoned and you know they were just not free [noise] 

307.59 308.81 A: yeah 

309.04 311.33 A: i- is that a phone of your's ringing

312.40 313.94 A: oh yeah [sigh] 

313.32 315.45 B: (( yeah yeah my kids'll get it )) 

314.77 327.11 A: i was reading in the ah local paper here tonight ah in the editorial the person wrote a rather interesting and ah lengthy e- editorial on she's a teacher 

327.43 335.42 A: ah about um ancient history [mn] and she was ah pointing out that over in iraq [mn] [lipsmack] 

335.73 337.76 A: (( during the war that [sigh] )) 

338.05 339.24 A: the ah 

339.94 347.22 A: ah u._s. was mainly concerned well not mainly but it was ah concerned about ah protecting the oil fields 

347.26 352.07 A: and ah certain areas of military importance but 

352.11 353.50 A: the 

353.62 355.89 A: [sigh] area as you know [mn] 

355.91 360.56 A: ah is the cradle of civilization and they had the 

360.57 374.90 A: ah several museums or the ma- or the major museum there contained [sigh] um much irreplaceable ah documents and history of of ancient history of mankind's beginning and ah 

374.76 383.23 A: they gave no protection to that and most of it was destroyed which was upsetting to her 'cause she's a teacher of [mn] ancient civilization 

382.98 384.20 B: (( [noise] uh-hum [noise] [noise] )) 

384.59 390.50 A: but anyways ah what i'm saying is it is just too bad that ah that ah 

391.56 399.49 A: [sigh] ah things of importance to to humanity like that just didn't get the same protection as um 

399.95 402.18 A: (( some ah )) 

402.23 409.54 A: [lipsmack] features that the government co- ah feels are important to militarization [mn] 

408.26 413.87 B: mm you know [noise] i don't think [noise] you know i i don't think they were thinking about that [noise] 

414.32 424.74 B: you know ah did not have [noise] the knowledge that all of that was there [noise] i don't know though i don't know i mean i really don't know [noise] if they did or didn't [noise] 

417.97 419.87 A: (( [noise] oh i see )) 

420.34 422.75 A: yeah yeah 

423.90 426.38 A: right [sigh] [noise] 

425.26 431.73 B: you know i i feel they if hadda thought about it then they would've protected it 

431.32 433.25 A: yeah 

431.83 436.06 B: but that's just my guess on the subject well i felt bad too 

435.88 437.73 A: yeah 

436.18 437.99 B: ah that you know 

438.12 440.10 B: history was de- destroyed 

439.51 440.65 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

440.41 441.36 B: (( you know )) 

440.76 443.77 A: but then there is the ah the ah 

443.83 451.16 A: groups so to speak that feel that things could have been accomplished or settled or handled ah in a more 

451.30 456.76 A: peaceful way without going in there i don't know that ah how do you feel about that 

456.15 463.09 B: well i you know i i feel [noise] in in time it ah it would ha- happened in time [noise] 

462.79 464.60 A: yeah 

463.50 466.39 B: ah it would ah happened in a more peaceful way 

466.65 467.57 B: (( ah )) 

466.87 476.37 A: [sigh] but isn't it strange when they ah [lipsmack] were over there before that ah nothing was done to remove them him from power at the time when they 

476.20 477.07 B: (( ah huh )) 

476.54 482.41 A: when they were there and su- and supposedly ah [laughter] w- won the battle [sigh] 

481.80 484.20 B: right right right 

483.18 491.59 A: but ah there they go they they pull out over there at that time and left him there and i just ah myself don't understand that one do you 

491.45 493.51 B: i don't i don't understand it either 

493.15 494.85 A: (( yeah )) 

493.93 496.02 B: i don't understand it either no 

496.03 506.78 A: so there you know i do have my mixed feelings and i do have a lot of ah unanswered questions but ah anyhow ah i'm not placing judgement one way or the other [mn] 

499.09 499.81 B: (( right )) 

506.65 513.35 B: yeah yeah i i'm the same i have my mixed feelings about it you know ah you know i'm a man of peace [noise] 

512.87 514.86 A: (( yeah )) 

513.39 525.04 B: you know [noise] but you know at the same time you know i know that you know sometimes you know you have to go to war ah you know to to obtain peace that's my feeling you know 

523.00 526.23 A: yeah yeah yeah 

525.52 538.64 B: i know that someone asked me as being a man of god would i ever fight i said ah if someone's going to come and mess with my family yes i will [laughter] you know i will protect my family to the end 

535.83 539.60 A: yeah yeah oh yeah sure sure 

538.80 542.76 B: you know so yes i will you know but i will not commit murder or 

543.03 543.87 A: no 

543.07 544.73 B: (( anything like that you )) 

544.40 545.46 A: yep 

545.11 546.23 B: know i will 

546.44 554.29 B: and i think in th- the regime there in iraq they were ah committing murder and everything else you know on on their own people 

553.73 556.81 A: (( yeah oh yes yeah )) 

555.35 562.21 B: yeah so i was so in that respect i was glad that ah the u._s. went in 

562.28 564.72 B: and ah set the people free 

564.50 565.54 A: yeah [sigh] 

565.12 566.78 B: (( from that regime )) 

566.21 576.99 A: but i find it interesting too that ah the people over there ah you have different factions such as ah groups that ah was glad to see the troops and ah claimed to ah 

575.47 576.26 B: right 

577.24 590.42 A: be happy to have these ah [lipsmack] restraints lifted that ah saddam and his group had had over the country but then there is the groups ah the group or groups that 

582.06 582.84 B: yes 

590.52 596.04 A: just didn't want the u._s. there at all i mean just why would they feel that way i wonder [noise] 

596.19 599.89 B: well i- right the ah ah
