176.25 178.78 B: so my sister and i are the two only girls 

178.39 181.99 A: [laughter] so you have more responsibility than most [laughter] 

181.34 183.33 B: yeah basically 

183.73 186.13 B: but um back to holidays 

184.65 191.65 A: it's good training though you know it's really good tr- 'cause then you get to you'll be eventually the matriarch of your family

197.80 199.64 B: (( [laughter] ah it's too [noise] )) 

198.13 206.38 A: well you know i i guess i should probably tell you one of the reasons i like christmas so much it's not just so much the families and the food and the 

206.45 213.48 A: and the guests it's like it's more sacred to me it's the most sacred and and spiritual of all the holidays 

213.01 215.44 B: oh so you're very religious [noise] 

214.69 218.86 A: well no i'm not really religious but i would say i'm spiritual 

218.40 220.46 B: mhm [noise] 

218.97 231.17 A: because um you know what a- i- ah there's a huge difference to me and um th- all the imagery with ah christmas you know with the tree and the seven branches of the tree corresponding to the 

227.88 229.60 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

231.16 235.93 A: seven seals in the bo- in the human body and the seven planes but 

235.27 238.89 B: oh really oh are you more of a holistic person 

238.43 240.25 A: yeah definitely holistic

253.81 255.07 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

254.45 265.01 A: you know and the whole pagan celebration of of the changing of the seasons and christmas and the time to dream you know to be quiet and dream dream a new year into being 

264.98 270.22 A: for christmas and you know to me that's really [mn] that's the most profound 

270.41 278.18 A: moment is that's we're at our greatest creative moment because we're dreaming a whole new year into being at christmas 

270.65 271.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

277.46 283.92 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah yeah christmas is definitely the end of the year and time for celebration [noise] [noise] 

283.23 290.86 A: [noise] yeah and you know people just generally are happier and their they're more generous and more considerate and more thoughtful and 

287.76 289.17 B: yeah [laughter]

437.15 442.78 A: you know you could do it you could do neighborhoods or you could do sections of town if you're in the big city 

442.27 443.76 B: yeah 

443.11 445.36 A: you know but for me 

443.87 453.87 B: yeah that would be nice and it it would have to be like volunteer you know like you don't have to go 'cause i mean people that go and p- you make somebody do something that they don't want do it's never a good thing 

445.49 446.76 A: (( oh it is )) 

453.63 458.42 A: yeah it'd definitely be volunteer but it'd be so much fun that who would want to miss it 

457.58 463.68 B: [noise] [noise] i know [laughter] yeah that would be fun oh i want to do that now 

458.64 460.55 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

462.20 476.68 A: i think so because you know we used to do it when i was a kid we'd get together in the summer like not fourth of july but later on in the middle of the summer like usually a couple of weeks later and all the community we'd bring pies and salads and 

471.10 472.28 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

474.36 478.53 B: yeah i like big barbecues [laughter] [noise] 

477.07 485.35 A: yeah and then everybody the kids would play games outdoors 'cause we had an island in between two rivers that went through the town 

481.09 482.42 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

485.03 486.51 B: oh that's cool 

486.19 490.89 A: yeah and so everybody would come to the island and you could come and go all day long 

490.66 491.82 B: that's cool 

491.08 499.76 A: you know so people would come in leave come back you know and we just e- and you know we'd just have food and games for the kids and 

499.92 513.59 A: all th- you know everybody would talk and people you hadn't seen you know all year you'd get to see 'em again and renew old friendships and and meet relatives and it was really special so i'd i'd like that holiday too i think 

502.24 502.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

503.90 504.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

504.50 506.45 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

512.73 522.95 B: yeah i like barbecues just like you eat and you enjoy [noise] and we used to have campfires 'cause it would get darker and colder [noise] and everyone would sit around and roast marshmallows it'd be fun 

522.57 524.50 A: [laughter] 

523.26 529.72 B: and then i had some with my friends too [noise] and we were swimming and stuff it it'd have to be when it was warm 

530.19 538.98 A: oh definitely that's the best that's that's definitely the best 'cause then you don't have to worry about all the challenges that go with weird weather 

531.94 533.48 B: [mn] like maybe 

533.85 535.62 B: maybe in late may 

538.57 546.12 B: yeah [noise] yeah like late may 'cause june it gets a little bit warm to be outside well [mn] it all depends on if it's like a swimming pool party 

546.13 548.08 A: [laughter] 

547.39 554.63 B: [noise] so our holiday would be a big giant barbecue slash swimming slash community fun day [laughter] [noise] 

554.07 566.76 A: food fest fun day or something [laughter] community fun day [laughter] and maybe we should celebrate it once a month [laughter] instead of just once a year [laughter] [laughter] 

555.24 557.70 B: (( yeah [laughter] food fest )) 

557.91 560.89 B: [laughter] that's good 

562.93 565.21 B: yeah once a month would be good 

565.52 570.46 B: we need one big giant arena or something for everybody to come or a big tent 

570.55 573.44 A: oh that would be great a big huge white tent 

573.24 574.73 B: yeah 

573.59 579.64 A: you know and little tents like you know with special things for the kids or for the older that need a place to sit down
