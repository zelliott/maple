2.33 4.09 A: [noise] hi i'm sherice 

3.84 5.35 B: i'm gregory 

4.92 5.84 A: how are you 

5.72 7.25 B: all right how are you [laughter] 

6.59 7.82 A: i'm okay 

9.06 12.13 B: [sigh] it's seems we've got a pretty outdated topic [laughter] 

11.92 13.89 A: yeah i was really surprised [laughter] 

14.73 19.19 A: yeah i mean i think we're over there for a reason let's get rid of it and get going 

19.25 20.58 B: i'm sorry 

20.03 23.15 A: i think we went over there for a reason to disarm 'em 

21.55 22.22 B: ye- 

23.29 25.22 B: well that's what we said anyway [sigh] 

25.26 27.06 A: i mean i don't know 

27.84 37.01 A: if we're over there why we're not doing what we're going to do but i i'd hate to see us go over there and leave 'em with all this arm and then have to go back again some time 

36.69 40.28 B: yeah from what i can tell from the newspapers it sounds like 

40.33 50.46 B: they went in there claiming they would find stuff um they were so sure they had the intelligence reports and so forth [sigh] but they've been there for months now and nothing has been found right [laughter] 

49.82 51.47 A: (( they didn't find anything big )) 

51.57 53.15 B: right right 

52.14 56.29 A: they might have found you know they didn't find what they had thought they were going to go get but 

56.40 60.34 A: then again how how do i really know that's they went over there for [laughter] 

60.64 63.64 A: that could've been just what they said they were gonna do [noise] 

62.61 65.57 B: [laughter] right it was a good selling job you know 

64.91 66.30 A: (( yeah bu- )) 

65.72 70.53 B: they spun the invasion pretty well in the press [laughter] 

69.84 72.05 A: but they need to get over there and ah 

72.58 76.06 A: get what they wanna do and get out and come back home and [sigh] 

76.13 78.64 A: then leave 'em on their own [sigh] [noise] 

78.08 81.60 B: we- i guess the question becomes then how to leave them on their own i mean 

80.85 84.98 A: [mn] i don't know because they're sure violent against us right now all of a sudden [noise] 

84.86 86.11 B: i'm sorry 

85.49 87.70 A: they're sure fighting us right now 

87.31 88.21 B: right 

87.80 90.39 A: [noise] you know i thought [noise] we went over there to help them 

90.07 92.45 B: [sigh] that's what we said [sigh] we 

91.43 95.18 A: and so if we're over there helping them why are they turning on us 

95.52 98.89 B: [sigh] probably because they aren't happy with us either [laughter] 

98.17 99.10 A: (( [noise] well )) 

99.19 101.80 A: i can't believe they wanted to live the way they were living 

101.57 105.10 B: well it's possible th- that they like neither option right 

104.46 113.06 A: right yeah wh- what's your other choice though [laughter] there's not a whole lot of places [laughter] you know it's either this or that [mn] 

106.83 109.26 B: right [laughter] 

111.59 112.38 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

113.20 116.88 A: and it seems like we were being pretty nice guys to go over there and help 'em 

117.64 120.18 B: [mn] i suppose i don't know i'm a little 

119.28 123.72 A: i don't know i guess you know i'd have to really [sigh] wonder you know 

124.22 130.99 A: you know nobody asked my opinion when they went over there so i guess [mn] i don't know all the facts 'cause if i did i might have a different opinion 

131.25 134.85 A: [noise] i only know what th- the media's reporting don't i 

134.66 139.51 B: [sigh] right yeah i've been trying to read british newspaper websites and so forth to 

135.69 137.19 A: that would 

139.54 140.87 B: try to get some 

141.10 144.03 B: angle on the story at least that's not the official u._s. 

144.93 146.19 B: [sigh] angle [sigh] 

146.06 148.84 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] but is their op- opinion any different 

148.22 155.31 B: [sigh] um they're somewhat more open about criticizing their government [mn] ah i think the invasion wasn't quite as popular over there in britain 

151.63 152.40 A: oh 

154.97 155.88 A: (( uh-huh )) 

155.80 160.40 B: and so you know the newspapers aren't quite as much in line with ah 

160.66 162.29 B: rah rah let's go 

162.15 167.20 A: [noise] [noise] well after seeing ah bush [noise] last night it seemed like he had quite a lot of support 

167.41 170.06 B: [laughter] he was on the aircraft carrier right 

169.44 172.52 A: yeah but even the news media today played it up pretty 

172.85 173.90 B: ok- that's true 

172.96 174.66 A: pretty good you know 

174.37 175.69 B: yeah 

175.37 176.49 A: that ah 

176.41 183.91 B: [mn] -s a good point [sigh] i do wonder about the credibility though like we said like you said that we're going to go over there and find stuff 

177.97 178.54 A: (( [noise] )) 

184.16 189.42 B: and if we don't find anything what's going to happen next time with the next country 

186.04 186.75 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

187.72 188.65 A: well 

189.99 193.67 A: yeah but hasn't every president had his own war [laughter] 

193.19 195.93 B: ah [laughter] maybe bush got jealous 

195.55 198.30 A: i mean isn't that kinda like norm [laughter] 

198.36 199.38 B: i'm sorry 

198.82 207.41 A: everybody every president's had their own wars or maybe he's just wanted to i don't know but [noise] he sure doesn't seem to be low in 

202.71 203.89 B: i suppose [sigh] 

207.43 211.78 A: right now he seems to be okay in his ratings right now after last night's speech 

211.95 216.50 A: every thing i read said he people were really impressed with his speech 

216.36 220.01 B: ye- yeah i didn't see it but i i the newspapers they seem to be 

217.50 218.71 A: but 

219.58 221.17 A: (( but ah )) 

220.50 222.19 B: pleased with it yeah 

221.60 227.86 A: but then you know i could do a good speech too if i had five hundred people [noise] helping me write it [laughter] 

225.29 227.17 B: [laughter] [laughter] right [laughter] 

227.88 231.07 A: it's my crummy speech all by myself that gives me trouble 

230.70 232.08 B: [laughter] 

231.32 233.65 A: [laughter] 

233.11 237.63 B: i d- i wonder when do when do presidents stop writing their own speeches 

237.36 239.07 A: i don't think they ever do do they 

239.11 241.66 B: you don't think like lincoln or washington wrote their own 

240.69 247.86 A: well yeah back in those days 'cause they didn't have any flunkies like we do right nowadays i think nobody in the government president 

243.72 245.15 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

246.86 251.82 B: no i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure like junior senators have speechwriters uh left and right [noise] [laughter] 

249.85 253.19 A: yeah but i think ya know 

253.40 258.40 A: i don't know he's [sigh] that would be a tough call i don't want to make it if i you know [sigh] 

258.71 262.95 A: i don't want to have to go worry about going to war if i'm going to be president [laughter] just 

263.21 266.42 A: let me to do up the big things like the price a gas or something 

267.14 268.31 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [mn] )) 

267.29 271.74 A: [mn] but he'd better do something if he goes over there 'cause if he comes back with nothing 

272.42 275.89 A: ya know it's like a little boy crying wolf we're not going to believe him again 

272.95 273.72 B: yeah 

275.86 280.51 B: yeah and i'm sure th- that's going to be the other side of th- of the suspicion 

280.59 286.08 B: that if they come over there spend two months looking around all of a sudden tomorrow they say they found something 

286.38 288.23 B: (( people are going to say is it planted )) 

287.57 289.07 A: (( [noise] right [sigh] [noise] i )) 

288.33 293.31 B: is it just us putting things there because we can't not find anything [laughter] 

293.44 295.13 A: guess he's not going to win is he 

295.91 298.76 A: how many more years does he have to [laughter] 

297.71 301.24 B: [laughter] i think he put himself in the situation though 

300.86 302.79 A: yeah 

301.42 306.25 B: it's his fault for going in there with no international backing and no 

306.52 307.85 A: yeah 

308.26 312.03 A: [mn] and do we don't even know if we'll ever find if we got the man or not 

311.54 319.36 B: [sigh] right he's dispp- he's disappeared bin laden yeah bin laden disappeared saddam disappeared 

312.63 314.53 A: (( so how are we to ever know )) 

314.89 316.29 A: that we got him 

318.77 321.01 A: yeah everybody's gone 

320.21 324.88 B: mm yeah they don't die they just [mn] go into hiding it seems 

321.68 322.44 A: (( so [noise] )) 

324.27 329.76 A: yeah well yeah [laughter] i guess i'd go into hiding too if they were shooting at me 

329.50 335.85 B: s- sure but are they any safer are th- are they any less dangerous to us when they're in hiding 

330.73 331.53 A: (( right )) 

335.28 336.17 A: no 

335.98 336.84 B: no 

336.86 338.90 A: i don't know because 

339.13 343.50 A: [sigh] it it seems like we kinda took out all his ah helpers didn't we 

343.26 347.23 B: [mn] ah sounds like it i'm sure he doesn't have the same you know 

347.13 348.35 A: so i mean 

347.47 352.42 B: deluxe accommodations and communication network that he used to have so 

352.32 356.77 A: [noise] i mean we've taken out his relatives even [laughter] 

354.62 358.42 B: [sigh] [laughter] well they keep capture capturing his half brothers 

358.52 359.68 B: on the border 

358.56 360.02 A: did we get them too 

359.95 362.05 B: yeah they got a couple of them um 

361.46 362.28 A: oh 

362.43 366.04 B: which is i guess useful for d._n._a. testing i think 

365.23 368.21 A: he sure lived like the king didn't he 

368.35 369.99 B: i'm sorry yeah 

368.91 370.68 A: he sure lived like a king 

370.79 377.17 B: [laughter] i must say i loved the photos of the u._s. soldiers lounging around in the golden beds and the gilded 

374.05 375.86 A: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah and then the 

376.91 381.06 A: i think you know they should all go there and have a shower or something and play because ah 

377.81 378.84 B: bathtubs 

379.25 380.47 B: [laughter] 

382.13 386.07 A: boy oh boy the way he lived i'd only could dream of 

386.21 391.41 B: yeah well when you're an absolute dictator you can live as you wish i'm sure 

389.29 392.18 A: yeah how did he get so much money i guess 

392.50 393.62 B: yeah 

393.26 393.88 A: (( oh )) 

394.13 399.66 B: they were finding charred dollar bill corners i heard like charred hundred dollar bills 

398.23 399.40 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

399.60 400.59 A: shh 

400.88 405.28 A: everything was gold and it oh my god it was just so beautiful i just 

405.36 410.87 A: think the people that would be over there would be so angry when they saw the inside of those pictures 

410.46 412.39 B: [laughter] [mn] oh i'm sure they knew 

412.51 416.52 A: [noise] because god oh if my president were living like that and i don't have any 

417.14 420.21 A: [noise] place to even sleep you know [laughter] 

419.45 420.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

421.37 422.55 A: but then 

422.66 424.95 A: i guess it's a different way to live over there 

425.09 426.98 B: [laughter] yeah but 

427.02 428.87 A: i don't want to go over there and live though 

428.73 430.19 B: (( [laughter] )) 

430.06 432.51 A: have you ever done one of these before these

455.33 457.49 A: oh aha i hope they call me a lot 

457.43 460.91 B: well it's three calls per person i think 

459.85 461.62 A: for wh- for good 

461.29 464.65 B: i'm sorry i i think that's what they said yeah 

461.92 462.90 A: forever 

464.04 465.18 A: oh well 

464.99 465.94 B: because 

466.25 473.02 B: i suppose they want a wide net of people um you know they want us to have lots of different voices and accents and so forth 

472.87 473.86 A: oh 

473.68 477.37 B: so that's my guess i don't know i'm not quite sure what they're doing with these ah

480.32 483.58 A: i signed up to read the ads too and i've been reading those so 

483.47 485.99 B: mm how are those i haven't seen that 

485.42 491.14 A: um they're not bad an- it takes [noise] it's just a pop up ad ya know so i read those and 

491.24 496.12 A: [sigh] it's kinda boring [laughter] but you only have to stay on ten seconds 

492.84 493.93 B: [laughter] 

496.06 500.77 B: yeah i suppose the only interesting advertising i've ever heard of is on the superbowl 

497.30 497.98 A: (( so )) 

500.77 501.51 A: (( oh )) 

501.23 503.17 B: all the other ads are boring [sigh] 

502.59 506.76 A: yeah well these are definitely boring 'cause they're all the pop ups on the computers 

506.75 508.47 B: mm that's no fun 

508.07 510.08 A: so they're very very boring 

510.12 514.36 A: [mn] so [noise] now does somebody come back and talk to us when we're done or what happens 

513.35 517.85 B: [sigh] oh they said they would tell us when ten minutes are up um 

518.82 519.75 A: (( oh )) 

518.83 522.43 B: [noise] at the beginning that's what they said i'm not sure if ah 

520.19 521.37 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

521.83 524.82 A: (( well [noise] i don't know i just )) 

523.95 526.69 B: i thought i thought it was ten minutes by now but [sigh] [laughter] 

526.09 530.46 A: i just hope my sons never have to go over there and fight [laughter] anywhere 

530.87 538.43 B: yeah i guess that's the plus side of an all volunteer military right unless there's a draft you can never be forced to fight 

531.39 532.40 A: [laughter] you know 

535.33 536.33 A: yeah 

537.74 539.00 A: thank god [noise] 

538.84 540.92 B: yeah definitely 

540.31 553.87 A: that would really but you know i don't know if it's worse though when you know you watch all these people over there and you thank god we're going over there we're doing you some good at least we thought we were going to do you some good and now all of a sudden you're shooting at us 

553.93 556.01 A: i think i'd be pretty angry [laughter] 

555.44 556.44 B: (( yeah [laughter] ah )) 

556.76 557.66 B: (( [sigh] )) 

557.71 561.24 A: you know i'd want to think that when i went over there it was for a reason 

561.86 565.20 A: [noise] but i don't know if was or not you know how am i supposed to know 

565.05 570.27 B: [sigh] well if you can't trust your president i guess there's not much of a way to tell 

569.99 570.83 A: (( [noise] well )) 

571.12 574.82 A: i've never had to not trust him so i guess i'd better tr- trust him now so 

574.08 579.13 B: [laughter] he doesn't behave in a very trustworthy fashion though [laughter] 

575.22 576.92 A: [laughter] 

578.50 586.15 A: [noise] he's you know he's got a nice little [noise] soft accent you know he kinda [noise] reminds me of like [noise] a hometown [noise] boy and i kinda 

586.73 592.51 A: you know he doesn't tr- [noise] give me a bad vibe or anything you know at all [noise] 

590.71 595.25 B: right i guess that's his ap- that's his appeal right that oh shucks 

594.61 596.16 A: i guess you know of 

595.38 596.40 B: image 

596.25 598.06 A: course i liked his daddy
