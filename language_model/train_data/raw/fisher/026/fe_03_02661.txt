146.97 149.72 B: oh yeah yeah of course of course um 

150.05 153.74 B: [mn] well hey if you could create a holiday what would it be 

154.03 154.76 A: (( um )) 

154.90 169.00 A: it'd probably be it'd probably be on one of the solstices it'd be creation and destruction on monday so you'd like take out your bureau and stuff that you didn't really want and i don't know have captions and you'd probably destroy them all then you then you'd have a nice meal 

168.98 173.04 A: and um get pretty smashed and then you put it all back together in a whole new way 

173.07 175.63 B: [mn] oh that's very nice [laughter] 

174.51 181.93 A: i think i think so i mean it incorporates food it incorporates you can dress up as you destroy things and as you create things i don't know 

182.57 184.39 A: just that sort of thing how about you oh 

182.65 186.12 B: [laughter] i'll i'll show up for it um 

185.60 187.66 A: (( woohoo [laughter] )) 

186.96 188.50 B: there would be 

188.91 191.29 B: um hanging out at the beach day 

191.35 195.75 B: a- and i and i think people would just hang out at the beach and be nice 

191.50 193.07 A: ooh that's nice 

195.90 197.92 A: (( yeah wo- would there be costumes involved )) 

197.58 205.68 B: [laughter] i- if you want i think it would be like you know pretty open rules you know i think people should talk about their feelings though for like three hours of the day 

205.87 209.58 A: for three hours of the day of of of that of that particular day can 

206.94 208.21 B: yeah that would be 

209.41 211.01 B: yeah yeah i think 

210.15 212.27 A: they sit on anyone's lap while they did it 

212.22 217.68 B: i don't know but since you know since it is my fantasy holiday [laughter] i i like 

216.98 219.11 A: but there might as well be some lap sitting 

218.54 224.77 B: there should be some lap sitting and there should be some just people talking and people playing with the car hanging out 

224.92 228.35 B: i'd like it [laughter] 

226.07 232.93 A: and and would would there be food too like would like the food of this holiday holiday be burritos and like orange crush or something but 

232.06 242.30 B: i i think i'd leave that open too 'cause uh if you just have the kind of the pressure of the unsaid need for the food then everyone would kinda you know choose to their favorite 

241.19 248.29 A: the other thing is like people need food everyday and there's sort of a wonderful thing just to like the smell of the turkey and just knowing that that's 

248.80 260.11 A: um i don't know that that's something to look forward to and it is sort of a task but it's wonderful to have tasks that are directed towards like pleasing other people or just to creating a mood i don't 

259.41 260.83 B: oh yeah totally 

261.76 262.60 A: (( know )) 

262.71 265.05 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

264.12 265.89 A: i i i i don't know 

266.30 270.14 A: like that's that's how i feel and then there should be um 

270.52 276.20 A: and see plus i don't know just like it didn't feel like a holiday to me if my back doesn't hurt from overeating 

275.99 276.96 B: (( uh-huh )) 

276.36 281.04 A: um so yeah i don't know something could be done about that 

280.41 283.51 B: i remember it was a couple of christmases ago i um 

283.56 293.32 B: you know i ususally don't live where my family lives and so i'd come in and it was uh a big feast a big huge feast like you can imagine like every two hours another meal came out of the oven 

292.71 294.02 A: this is christmas 

293.67 296.01 B: yeah and um 

296.15 305.69 B: i would eat till i was physically ill and then i would pass out cold i would just i would fall asleep and as soon as i woke up i'd just start eating again 

298.61 300.20 A: [laughter]

305.00 306.84 A: (( meal would be ready mhm )) 

306.25 315.12 B: it it was a really funny thing but like admittedly like i had a friend over and she was like oh my god what's wrong with you and it was like kinda like you know petting my forehead and massaging my stomach 

311.20 313.35 A: (( [laughter] ))

319.71 334.18 A: it sounds so italian just like the i mean the bombatoriums that sort of thing i could i could get into that every every once in a while i mean like not every day like lunch i have to vomit again but um but i think maybe like once a year i could probably get into that 

323.13 325.22 B: uh-huh exactly 

325.94 327.53 B: [laughter] 

333.30 337.37 B: i mean the people took over the world let's say you know [laughter] back then [laughter] 

336.43 341.22 A: you know they they must have had something going on and i think that thing is the vomiting 

340.82 342.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

341.25 352.95 A: it it didn't go on they had lead pipes and that's my grandfather says that's the reason that the italian um civilizations started to fall because people started getting lead poisoning but i don't i don't know civilizations has its prices

529.84 531.36 A: [laughter] 

533.61 546.49 B: for me at least it's always it's always coming back to holidays you know the the times when you reflect on on where you've where you've gone in your life 'cause it's a static thing you know and they're like tied in with the seasons 

546.13 547.72 A: it's all cyclical 

547.54 549.12 B: of course of course 

548.13 560.68 A: you know um my family has a hazelnut farm in oregon and i haven't been back for harvest for five years and this year's going to be the first year that i'm gonna be back for harvest and it just feels like i mean that's a little five year cycle there that's 

560.82 567.54 A: well it i i feel that it's quite overdue but it's just and it's gonna bring everything home like just that sort of like wrapping up again 

567.43 571.31 B: yeah yeah totally it's gonna be such powerful stuff you know 

571.36 578.52 A: it's gonna be extremely extremely powerful i'm going to be feeling the earth goddess like coursing through my body as i'm on that tractor 

578.52 584.54 B: no doubt no doubt and i think i think that's i mean frankly that's like the origin of like a holiday you know 

578.55 579.26 A: so 

584.59 586.36 B: is like the the power 

585.87 587.53 A: is feeling the spirit yeah 

587.08 599.89 B: yeah it's the the spirit and and the power and the particular energy of a point in time and just the basic life functions that need to occur at that time um and and then you know you got like ho- 

594.80 595.56 A: yeah
