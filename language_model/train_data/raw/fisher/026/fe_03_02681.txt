153.60 161.68 A: um but yeah at a again then it all depends you know you can only celebrate it if you're in a relationship otherwise uh it's not really a holiday 

161.33 164.40 B: right [laughter] um 

163.48 169.49 A: but uh i don't know that was kind of an interesting question that i just don't know how to answer it about creating a holiday 

167.22 168.71 B: [mn] yeah i mean 

169.10 178.27 B: [mn] um i don't know i mean i i guess i'd almost like everybody has created their own holiday in their birthday you can celebrate it however you like [mn] 

177.50 178.69 A: exactly 

178.32 181.31 B: (( um but yeah i'm trying )) 

180.49 192.12 A: but i don't you know i have an idea they should create a holiday so that everybody can be lazy without feeling bad and call it watch t._v. day and you do nothing but sit at home and watch really bad t._v. 

188.19 189.76 B: [laughter] 

191.74 193.26 B: [laughter] 

192.13 194.82 A: like the game show network all day long 

194.41 197.86 B: [laughter] that's a great holiday [laughter] 

195.58 205.88 A: that's my holiday seriously it should just be watch t._v. day and then no one has to feel bad about being a lazy bum just for day order food for three meals 

199.66 200.82 B: [laughter] 

202.11 203.82 B: [laughter]

210.33 212.78 B: that's a good holiday yeah [laughter] 

212.20 220.01 A: hopefully that will be taken into consideration that uh if i ever hear of that i'll know uh hopefully they'll pay me for the idea [noise] [noise] [noise] 

215.37 216.14 B: [laughter] 

219.35 233.31 B: [laughter] [mn] oh i'm trying to think um what other holidays are there [sigh] uh i think that the holidays that are like in celebration of people that did good things like martin luther king day um 

231.98 232.85 A: mm 

233.56 238.42 B: but tho- those aren't end up tha- that ends up being just like all about black people um 

237.77 248.87 A: yeah [mn] those kinds of holidays and that and president's day those are the kind of holiday that are just excuses at this point in time like the meaning is lost they're excuse to get out of school and work 

245.03 246.63 B: right right right 

247.09 248.33 B: right 

248.50 249.56 B: right 

248.72 257.01 A: because they're federal national holidays but they don't actually you know as far as i know they don't um celebrate the actual 

256.85 260.76 A: person you know president's day it used to be like i guess 

257.98 259.03 B: right 

260.56 261.17 A: (( [mn] )) 

261.00 275.85 A: it wasn't always called that it would be washington's birthday lincoln's birthday but then they combined them because they only wanted to give people one day off [laughter] and they made it you know oh they're birthdays are close let's combine it's like people who's birthdays are near christmas let's combine you know 

262.67 264.71 B: right it was like washington 

265.11 266.20 B: right 

268.92 270.08 B: [laughter] 

272.59 273.73 B: right 

275.11 277.14 B: right right right right 

277.20 281.77 A: those uh those holidays don't seem to have the meaning that they're supposed to you know 

281.06 284.40 B: right [mn] well new years is a good holiday i guess then 

284.89 287.88 A: [noise] new years is a good party holiday but uh 

288.06 294.70 A: i don't really enjoy it anymore because i i can't seem to find people to hang out with that don't like drink too much 

294.34 295.65 B: right right 

294.72 299.68 A: every everyone i know seems to not know what their alcohol limit is for some reason 

299.37 300.52 B: right 

300.28 303.85 A: and that's always a problem on a holiday like new years you know 

302.89 311.50 B: right right yeah i had a party at my house for new years a couple of years ago and i'll never do that again [sigh] never again [laughter] yeah 

308.54 316.22 A: never never no point in allowing drunk people into your house to trash it as they as they fit as they see fit 

314.22 315.39 B: yeah 

315.72 317.32 B: [mn] yeah 

316.40 325.65 A: but uh [noise] yeah that's that's the problem with new years is that it can be fun but so many people just don't know how to handle it don't they don't know how to handle holidays where it's like 

325.93 333.29 A: you know it's uh common to drink so okay let's drink but let's why drink till you get sick 

332.76 338.93 B: right right right you're supposed to just drink to have a good time not to like get totally be wasted [sigh] [noise] 

335.32 336.46 A: exactly 

337.79 340.70 A: exactly but i don't know i guess it's just uh 

341.09 342.67 A: you know my ir- 

341.59 343.70 B: the nature of the beast [laughter]

353.20 354.11 B: yeah 

353.39 354.61 A: i don't really 

354.42 367.16 A: i mean you know saint patrick's day is another one it's an excuse to get drunk it's not really about saint patrick who admittedly i don't really know who he was [laughter] i just know it's an irish holiday and you know used to be fun but again it's 

357.94 358.97 B: right 

362.40 363.58 B: right [laughter] 

366.92 371.55 A: one of those like let's get trashed and fall down holidays and i don't really do that so 

370.87 380.37 B: right right but i think that's the whole the whole point of like the new years like the new years' resolution that's like a you know it's a good idea and some people actually do hold up to them [mn] 

371.95 372.93 A: um 

379.78 380.95 A: yeah 

380.39 382.39 B: or um or even like 

382.40 393.25 B: uh like the idea of lent um and that you know that you have to give up something for a while [mn] [mn] i think it's a g- i mean it's a good idea especially if you believe you know in all that [mn] like you know 

387.10 388.71 A: right right 

391.37 401.75 A: in those things yeah i mean i [mn] i believe in god but i'm not religious and i don't i don't follow lent i don't go to church on easter and you know maybe i'm going to hell for that i don't know but i doubt it you know 

395.39 396.68 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

398.76 400.81 B: yeah i'm the same way [noise] [mn] 

402.50 409.78 A: i don't i don't know i mean i again if you believe in it it's a good idea 'cause it's a way it's a it's like a discipline thing you know if 

409.14 410.67 B: right right right 

409.98 417.59 A: you can keep to those types of things but uh i just don't see the point personally for me you know but for other people it's you know 

414.49 416.31 B: yeah me too [laughter] 

417.26 418.40 B: [sigh] 

417.74 419.38 A: whatever works you know

425.62 426.57 B: um 

425.74 427.37 A: don't know but uh 

427.70 431.08 A: the most pointless holiday not that they ask but [noise]

433.46 434.63 A: (( flag day )) 

434.43 435.65 B: flag day 

435.54 442.82 A: exactly that is g again it's it it wouldn't be pointless if it was one of those days that you actually got off for you know 

442.04 444.10 B: (( [laughter] )) 

443.22 444.24 A: (( [mn] [noise] ))

450.42 451.55 B: (( right )) 

459.05 460.41 A: [noise] there's a 

459.45 463.00 B: well aren't flag day and grandparent's day really close to each other 

462.90 464.88 A: i don't know but there's a it is 

463.69 468.97 B: i think i remember in elementary school having grandparents' day and flag day like all in the same day or something 

468.83 469.91 A: really 

469.31 471.03 B: [laughter] yeah 

470.05 473.07 A: it's just that it's never celebrated you know i mean like 

473.64 484.04 A: [mn] those are made up holidays and they're good ideas but grand- you don't hear grandparents' day like mothers' day you know mothers' day you celebrate grandparents' day is just like uh when is it 

475.41 476.38 B: mhm 

478.86 480.90 B: [mn] right right right 

483.39 484.53 B: yeah

491.28 492.82 A: [laughter] that's uh 

493.13 496.69 A: that's another one yeah secretary's day too i think [noise] may- 

496.54 509.46 A: maybe maybe [noise] yeah maybe secretaries have celebrate that you know people do something for that but i don't know when it is i don't know definitely a lot of made up holidays i think there's i think you could probably find a holiday 

501.92 502.83 B: right 

503.12 504.13 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

509.23 522.41 A: in any given week you know that [mn] it's it exists but not everybody participates so which is probably why they're having this survey you know to see what people do know about and celebrate but uh [mn] most [noise] 

510.49 512.17 B: right right right 

514.12 516.05 B: celebrates it right [noise] [noise] 

520.19 524.16 B: [noise] yeah i think there should be like a um a um 

524.20 532.70 B: random act of kindness oh uh you know day where everyone just does random nice things for people that they don't know and don't tell them their names and you know 

532.55 534.64 A: that's a good idea actually 

532.69 539.61 B: just to just to help out like you know the world around you you know what i mean just to make people nicer to each other [mn] [noise] 

538.54 545.50 A: that is a good idea that's yeah i would go for that i would definitely one day i could stop being a bitch that's excellent 

544.06 546.52 B: [laughter] i'm the same way 

545.70 550.31 A: and that would make me feel better about the other three hundred and sixty four days absolutely 

548.66 553.22 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

550.32 554.75 A: absolutely good idea [noise] so you know but uh 

555.01 560.28 A: i don't know you know it's jus- the big holidays i celebrate the rest of 'em 

560.45 563.55 A: are kinda just there but uh

568.37 568.98 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

569.06 570.38 A: any of those 

570.60 580.59 A: you know national holidays i don't get off work for so like i said you know that's the only reason that that that people actually acknowledge those days unfortunately so 

579.76 581.40 B: right right right 

580.79 585.91 A: i don't really pay much attention to them myself because i don't uh they don't really affect me which i 

585.23 599.89 B: right right yeah i'm i'm a musician so um holidays are just kinda like if it's usually on holidays are days that you have to work [laughter] like you know 'cause of the days that most you know people really want to be entertained you know so [mn] 

593.24 594.24 A: (( right [noise] )) 

598.00 599.49 A: exactly
