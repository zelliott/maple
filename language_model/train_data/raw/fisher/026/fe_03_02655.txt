0.00 1.95 A: yes good afternoon my name is paul 

1.51 4.45 B: [noise] hello paul my name's christie 

3.90 5.43 A: how are you doing today christie 

4.80 6.40 B: oh fine [noise] 

5.91 8.33 A: all rightey so why don't you start on the topic 

8.03 11.49 B: ah [sigh] what would your favorite holiday be 

11.06 15.36 A: [sigh] my favorite holiday is veterans' day because i'm a veteran [noise] [noise] 

14.73 16.04 B: oh okay 

16.23 22.10 B: all rightey um mine well i guess ah one of my favorites would be fourth of july 

22.04 24.39 A: oh fourth of july [noise] independence day 

23.93 24.87 B: yeah 

24.53 25.41 A: (( uh-hum [noise] [noise] )) 

24.90 26.89 B: i love summer and i 

26.92 29.07 B: love ah [sigh] history 

29.37 31.65 B: and the importance of ah 

31.88 34.12 B: fourth of july so i guess [sigh] 

34.61 36.26 B: that's a good one for me 

35.99 49.06 A: [noise] [noise] yeah well veterans' day is a good one because i served in vietnam [sigh] i did a tour of duty over there [sigh] my son is serving in iraq right now in the marines [sigh] so it's going to be a sort of family trait now from now on [noise] 

44.89 45.88 B: oh 

48.43 49.73 B: (( oh uh-hum )) 

49.12 62.98 A: but the other part of it was wh- what would i trade it for and for me that would be kind of hard i mean as we veterans don't well we get two days actually we get memorial day for the dead and just v- you know veterans' day for all veterans [sigh] and um 

61.18 62.33 B: (( uh-hum )) 

63.11 69.78 A: the only thing i would like to trade is that when i came back from vietnam they didn't have no parade for us [laughter] i mean that's about the only thing that um [sigh] 

68.92 70.26 B: yeah 

69.62 80.79 A: sort of saddened me a little bit about that because you know after the [noise] you know desert storm they got a parade world war two world war one [sigh] everybody got a parade [noise] but everybody who came back from vietnam it was like we fought the um 

80.71 85.28 A: [sigh] the un-winnable war or something like that but for trading it for another day i 

85.35 86.33 A: i 

86.41 93.25 A: since it's only one day i i really don't see any need to trade it off for something else it's doing you know 'cause it's it's in warm weather 

93.28 104.21 A: and [sigh] ah hopefully i would like for more people to show up for the parades [noise] but [sigh] i think for in the years to come more and more people will probably show up for the parades again like they used to do ah you know in the y- years past [noise] [noise] 

103.87 107.45 B: uh-hum ah maybe they need to have um vietnam 

107.92 110.35 B: ah war veterans' day 

110.57 112.10 B: to celebrate 

112.16 113.65 B: just that war 

113.78 116.69 B: that was a [noise] that was a hard one 

117.23 122.81 B: [noise] and really and like you said i don't think you [sigh] really got recognized for it [sigh] 

122.94 124.82 B: when the troops came home 

125.02 127.30 B: [sigh] they didn't recognize them like they should've 

125.05 137.52 A: [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] well it was yeah it it didn't have the popularity [noise] [noise] an- and it's unfortunate to use that word [sigh] but it didn't have the popularity but [sigh] the the only thing i understand is that it's for [noise] 

128.98 130.13 B: (( yeah uh-hum )) 

137.94 147.64 A: today's war in iraq [sigh] it it it was an intangible just like the vietnam war was on an intangible and world war one and world war two was a definite move [sigh] 

147.47 157.46 A: okay um [noise] we we we got to defeat the enemy ah that [noise] 'cause they want to take over but th- [noise] you know vietnam was we don't want nobody nobody want they they couldn't take over us 

157.44 162.70 A: and there was no way we was going to take over them [noise] we could have probably changed the government again [sigh] [noise] [sigh] ah 

162.47 176.63 A: but you know it was just one of those things but [sigh] i'm i'm i tell you i'm a little bit at a loss as as far as how do you trade off a holiday and why would you want to trade it off that's the ah the one part of the topic [laughter] i really didn't understand i could see what's your favorite holiday [sigh] [noise] [laughter] [noise] 

175.08 179.21 B: [lipsmack] yeah i i don't know if i got that in my notes but ah yeah i wouldn't [sigh] 

179.47 180.45 B: i don't know 

180.76 184.08 B: [sigh] i don't know about that [laughter] [noise] 

181.90 194.64 A: [noise] yeah [noise] yeah i i listened to the topic it says ah w- what would you trade it for and i'm like okay well my favorite pick a favorite holiday and then trade it [sigh] [noise] [noise] a- and [sigh] and then i done thinking [noise] ah 

189.76 190.85 B: yeah 

194.68 203.57 A: [sigh] i'm trying to figure if where something else comes in like ah a holiday comes monday m- m- m- make your holiday on a tuesday so you can get a a extra day off of work or something 

202.49 205.03 B: yeah friday or [laughter]

206.43 207.34 B: [laughter] 

206.90 219.61 A: that's the only ration- rationalization i can [laughter] get from that you know [noise] [noise] if i get two holidays in a row [laughter] then if i do go to work i get double time and a half and if i don't well then [laughter] i get two days off and i still get straight time pay 

210.14 210.94 B: (( [laughter] )) 

212.77 213.71 B: (( uh-hum )) 

215.87 216.96 B: yeah 

219.67 220.29 A: (( [laughter] )) 

220.25 229.82 B: [laughter] as far as having making another holiday i'd probably [sigh] commemorate september eleventh [mn] i've 

220.46 222.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

229.87 231.94 A: [noise] oh you come on nine eleven 

230.17 230.99 B: i would 

231.50 237.30 B: ah yeah i was surprised they didn't um do that the first time round when when 

236.70 241.13 A: [lipsmack] [noise] oh okay that's the that was the second part of th- the topic [noise] oh okay 

239.17 242.01 B: yeah the year following yeah 

241.41 255.06 A: all rightey see see you see you've got to slow those people down from new york we know every damn thing up here you know that right [laughter] 'cause we've got an opinion on everything [laughter] [noise] [noise] [sigh] ah yeah but okay [sigh] so 

246.25 247.96 B: [laughter] 

251.11 253.27 B: [laughter]

262.36 268.34 B: well that's when it happened [sigh] so you know when else would you commemorate it i don't know 

267.24 270.82 A: mm yeah oh okay all rightey all rightey [noise] that's 

270.58 285.37 A: [sigh] but then how how how do you list that like okay do you do you call it a nine eleven holiday or [sigh] the memorial for civilian casualties of a terrorist attack [sigh] i mean you you you understand what i'm talking about 

282.47 283.47 B: yeah 

284.63 287.13 B: anti terrorism day or i

295.16 296.72 B: [laughter] 

298.00 299.02 B: (( yeah and [noise] [laughter] right ))

308.68 322.99 A: yeah well you know what [noise] maybe we'd better start thinking of a name because some ti- ah some point in time in the near future [sigh] they might run one of those contests [sigh] where they ask people to submit a name [noise] for some kind of day [sigh] commemorating nine eleven 

322.62 323.91 B: yeah 

323.34 329.44 A: (( and they might have a million dollar prize and who knows [laughter] we might be able to win [laughter] [noise] )) 

326.02 328.11 B: yeah look how long [laughter] 

328.44 334.42 B: look how long it took 'em to figure out what what type of um memorial they were going to have 

334.29 335.44 A: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

334.50 338.24 B: that took a while i guess they're working on that now i think they're 

338.25 338.81 B: (( [sigh] )) 

338.86 346.30 B: from what i understand they already picked [sigh] an architect and his plans and um i don't know when they're going to start [noise] 

345.50 351.88 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah well they did pick an architect and his plans but they also opened up [sigh] [noise] open competition 

351.89 357.27 A: [sigh] for people to ah contribute architectural designs [sigh] [noise] that will be incorporated [noise] 

355.17 356.16 B: (( uh-hum )) 

357.38 367.12 A: into the designs that they're already gonna use [noise] but they're still having a problem with the footprints of the towers the the area below the area where the two twin towers stood 

359.98 361.17 B: (( uh-hum )) 

366.82 368.11 B: oh yeah 

367.52 372.80 A: okay they're having a problem with that [sigh] because some people wanted it to remain open [noise] 

372.65 386.30 A: [mn] and they they saying no we need to make that into a parking garage and a bus depot they saying no no no no no [sigh] you have to leave that open you know for commemoration [sigh] [noise] and then another group is saying [sigh] well who wants a big grave yard in the middle of a business area [mn] 

386.35 386.99 B: (( mm )) 

386.96 395.98 A: so it's it's it's going to be a little while before i think they have really really anything done on that maybe we're looking at two thousand and nine or something like that 

387.27 387.84 B: (( [noise] )) 

394.57 395.97 B: oh jeez [noise] [noise] 

395.78 402.53 A: yeah [mn] well it's going to be a while you know and new york city's in a fin- in a financial crisis [noise] well the whole country is in reality but ah [noise] 

401.96 405.63 B: yeah that's what i heard that they were trying to get a lot of 

405.66 409.73 B: ah business in there and they're still hurting that's what 

409.46 412.14 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh most definitely most definitely [noise] )) 

411.26 424.15 B: i heard and they had their peak there for a while everybody was coming [sigh] right afterwards 'cause they were [sigh] they were asked to come and [sigh] and we everyone wanted to help 'em out but now you know that period kind of left [sigh] 

424.41 427.26 B: and now they're starting to feel the [noise] 

428.30 438.42 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah but you got you got you got yeah you got my mind going now because i'm really [sigh] [noise] looking at what do you what would you call the day like a a day ah you know a holiday 

429.07 430.27 B: (( per- [sigh] )) 

438.33 445.80 A: com- commemorating nine eleven [sigh] [noise] this is just now that's it's like on my mind it's creating you know because i'm saying 

443.24 444.34 B: [laughter] 

445.76 453.82 A: [sigh] [noise] see but i i tell you i just thought memorial day but memorial day in in essence is act- in actuality [sigh] for soldiers that died in wars 

454.00 462.05 A: and well well yeah because well for soldiers because nobody never attacked this that country on that level or this country on that level before well you know 

461.83 467.15 A: [sigh] [noise] except for the revolutionary war and then the [sigh] civil war [noise] was this country decided we wanted to fight each other [laughter] 

467.04 478.86 A: [noise] [laughter] but that's neither here nor there [sigh] [noise] but now and so memorial day and veterans' day covers all of those [sigh] [noise] but um yeah and i think anti-terrorism day is kind of [sigh] [noise] it sounds kind of harsh [noise] 

467.22 468.09 B: (( uh-hum uh-hum mm ))
