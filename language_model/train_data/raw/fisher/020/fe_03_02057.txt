170.96 184.73 A: ahah right yeah no i'm in the mid west and it gets pretty brutal actually [mn] i've always lived in the mid west and i don't know why [laughter] because the winters get very very cold and the summers are very humid so 

185.06 187.75 B: i could do with some very very cold winters 

185.16 185.93 A: just 

187.80 189.41 B: our winters here are 

189.85 193.23 B: you know really pretty mild um 

191.39 192.67 A: oh really 

193.59 194.85 B: you know we

202.26 206.18 A: yeah they're just no- [laughter] frightened by that huh 

204.83 208.77 B: i'm serious everything just well we're not equipped to handle it 

208.19 209.49 A: yeah 

209.22 215.39 B: um so you know there's not a lot of outdoor type cold weather activity for round here you know 

214.92 216.00 A: yeah 

216.26 217.29 B: um 

217.33 223.40 B: the main thing to do outdoors in in the cold weather is to go from one place to another and 

222.77 223.93 A: mhm 

224.04 225.65 B: then get inside 

225.07 228.84 A: (( yeah no ski slopes huh in your area )) 

228.27 230.13 B: no no 

229.02 231.19 A: [laughter] yeah 

230.61 236.69 B: they have a man made hill ah called mount trashmore out in virginia beach [laughter] 

234.81 235.58 A: oh 

236.07 238.15 A: that sounds very appealing [laughter] 

236.94 250.40 B: [laughter] oh and people used to go sledding on it but um they've stopped in the last couple of years from going sledding the past couple of times it's snowed because they were doing some construction around there or something 

249.76 252.24 A: (( oh i see yeah )) 

251.30 255.45 B: [mn] um now the only kind of skiing to do around here is water skiing 

255.33 258.77 A: okay yeah yeah 

257.74 260.53 B: and that's obviously a summer time activity 

260.28 261.83 A: right right 

262.41 276.39 A: yeah i mean i like indoor things too but sometimes the winters get a little long you know once the weather turns a little bit [mn] it's nice to get out and people seem to be in such a good mood too you know no matter what they're doing outside 

276.47 278.92 A: i think just because the winters are kind of 

279.59 283.68 A: they get on people's nerves you know [laughter] around here 

282.18 289.34 B: yeah i don't know you know well i mean in the early part of the winter you know it's all holiday season and everything and i just love that 

288.73 289.80 A: yeah 

289.42 291.14 B: [laughter] 

290.40 292.29 A: yeah that is nice 

291.58 292.91 B: um 

293.64 297.38 B: you know one of the things i i wish we had around here was a white christmas 

297.14 298.08 A: oh 

298.64 299.99 B: um 

301.14 304.67 B: we've we've never seen one of those around here 

301.19 302.17 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

305.22 307.37 B: come close a couple of times but 

307.12 308.13 A: yeah 

307.58 313.37 B: it's not unusual like thanksgiving time to decide that you know it's a nice day for a walk 

313.40 314.57 A: mhm 

313.62 315.62 B: ah in the seventy degree weather 

315.42 317.36 A: seventy oh wow 

316.39 318.65 B: oh yeah you know so i mean 

319.89 321.42 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

320.45 330.23 B: you know it's just you know and that at that time of year you think you know w- w- with thanksgiving and the turkey and stuff like that cold weather would be much nicer 

330.12 333.86 A: so that's pretty normal to have weather in the sixties or seventies 

333.28 336.56 B: oh yeah in november and december yeah 

335.05 339.31 A: oh wow i didn't know it got that warm get or stayed that warm 

339.13 341.01 B: oh yeah um 

339.75 340.92 A: in virginia 

341.15 347.03 B: [mn] course right around here you know w- we have the water which helps keep us warmer you know the ocean 

346.23 348.05 A: (( mhm okay )) 

348.04 349.34 B: um 

349.43 351.02 B: but um 

351.76 360.97 B: you know so i guess you know when you when you talk about you know do you like cold weather better [laughter] or the hot weather my idea of cold weather is a little different than yours [laughter] 

355.97 356.89 A: mhm 

358.76 368.40 A: yeah i guess yeah i think we're talking from two different [laughter] perspectives like today is beautiful here i mean it's probably sixty 

368.72 374.90 A: [mn] you know i think it might get to seventy and this is perfect oh really 

372.21 379.02 B: that's about what it is right here yeah a little muggy but it was in the high sixties to low seventies 

378.92 380.16 A: oh okay 

380.24 386.06 A: it's actually a little almost chilly though because we have a wind kind of a breeze so 

386.52 388.36 A: [mn] it's okay if you take 

387.48 390.94 B: oh we had a little bit of a breeze come through we had a thunder storm come through 

391.25 392.22 A: (( okay )) 

393.00 396.29 A: yeah it must be nice to be near the ocean though i 

396.71 398.24 B: oh it's nice 

396.99 397.93 A: (( image yeah mhm )) 

398.49 399.64 B: (( i don't know )) 

400.65 404.24 B: i've spent most of my life near oceans of one sort or another 

404.68 408.61 B: so [laughter] i don't know what it would be like to be away from an ocean 

408.06 412.31 A: oh really see yeah i'm jealous i've never you know 

410.92 412.18 B: um 

412.47 414.00 A: had that experience 

413.99 417.25 B: you know i've talked to people and you know they they you know 

417.69 430.80 B: that that live inland and when they come to visit in this area and suchlike that and you know they say the air smells different and suchlike that you know only time i can smell it is when the tide's out [laughter] um 

421.29 422.74 A: mhm 

424.38 425.30 A: yeah 

427.68 429.13 A: (( [laughter] )) 

430.78 431.85 A: yeah 

430.95 432.30 B: but um 

432.39 442.44 B: yeah a couple of times i've gone as far inland as the blue ridge mountains and when i came back i could smell the sea so to speak for a few minutes at least 

439.65 440.79 A: mhm 

441.90 442.88 A: mhm 

442.46 444.13 B: but um 

445.16 447.91 A: then you're just immune to it i guess huh 

446.47 449.16 B: yeah um 

450.51 453.23 B: i'd say so what sort of indoor activities do you do 

453.69 455.72 A: (( um [mn] i )) 

455.83 458.85 A: let's see i'm trying to think i do um 

458.79 468.34 A: you know do things on the internet or kind of surf the net a little bit not a whole lot i mean i'm not too big into it um [lipsmack] i 

468.25 474.79 A: i'm not much of a bowler i found out recently i cannot bowl [laughter] so i don't do that any more 

471.69 472.74 B: [laughter] 

473.87 475.88 B: i used to bowl when i was young oh 

475.32 485.03 A: [laughter] i'm not very good um [mn] but i like to read too and i actually i'm a big movie renter even 

485.11 491.00 A: even in nice weather it doesn't matter i really i like to rent movies and um 

491.50 499.37 A: [mn] sometimes if i can find someone i like to play scrabble but ah i don't know that many people who like it any more 

499.12 500.81 B: [laughter] 

500.00 502.60 A: yeah i know it's [laughter] 

501.72 506.13 B: i like it but the only way i'll play it is if there's a dictionary handy 

505.59 508.29 A: ah and you can use it right 

507.03 515.54 B: i've i'm no no i don't want to use it to find the words i want to use it for the challenges and it has to be it has to be an unabridged dictionary 

512.11 513.22 A: (( oh )) 

514.96 515.85 A: (( ahah )) 

515.98 521.91 B: because too many times i've had words challenged nobody heard about them and if they didn't have an unabridged dictionary 

521.99 528.71 B: you know it it just didn't hold up so [laughter] you know i'm sorry you know [laughter] 

524.09 525.21 A: right 

525.87 526.91 A: and then 

527.40 528.60 A: [laughter] 

528.97 531.95 B: it's really a word [laughter] 

530.58 533.29 A: it really is a word yeah no 

533.40 536.86 B: [mn] yeah there's nothing more frustrating than to lose 

536.87 545.75 B: you know the twenty six points that you managed to come up with finally simply because they've never heard of that word and you you don't have an unabridged dictionary handy 

540.36 541.69 A: mhm 

545.15 548.41 A: yeah oh that's pretty good yeah twenty six 

546.70 548.03 B: um 

548.08 554.57 B: you know well i'm one of those that you know other than that i i i play these two and three point words [laughter] 

553.92 555.04 A: mhm 

555.13 567.28 A: yeah i know i don't know if i've ever played it officially with the official rules where you can challenge the other person you know maybe the other people i played maybe we all believe each other [laughter] 

565.89 569.86 B: well well well what bothers me about the rules on it is that 

569.93 574.35 B: you know you cha- you know if you challenge a person and you're wrong 

574.27 575.40 A: mhm 

574.40 576.15 B: you there's no penalty 

576.36 578.37 A: [mn] is that right though 

578.16 579.41 B: that's right 

578.84 582.17 A: don't don't you lose your turn or something like that oh mhm 

580.44 581.38 B: no 

581.63 584.67 B: you know that's the way i like to play it you know if you challenge me 

584.78 593.99 B: and you're wrong because if if you win the challenge then i lose my turn i have to take my letters back and i lose my turn 

593.50 595.77 A: yeah there should be some sort of 

594.32 595.87 B: and if you you 

595.96 599.95 B: lose the challenge there should be some penalty for for even bringing it up
