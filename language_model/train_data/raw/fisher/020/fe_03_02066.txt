423.02 424.20 B: yes 

423.69 428.83 A: so it's just kind of interesting that we we got linked up and we're both from the same area

440.44 441.72 A: oh really 

441.14 443.53 B: and we got disconnected so 

442.72 443.97 A: oh boy 

443.96 448.43 B: i don't know what happened but i called them and let them know i was still willing to do the study 

447.93 450.53 A: yeah yeah 

449.68 455.07 B: and i didn't get the last subject i had no idea what she was saying it just went off my mind 

454.32 458.30 A: yeah well i was switching telephones so i i didn't catch it either [lipsmack] 

457.78 458.99 B: mhm 

459.03 465.03 B: they have to do a little better uh i'll tell them when i but the the recording 

464.91 466.05 A: yeah 

465.46 469.88 B: yes perhaps a little bit be clearer and louder [laughter] 

466.18 467.18 A: yes 

469.23 472.17 A: well the guy i talked to from new jersey 

471.72 472.67 B: yes 

472.09 478.52 A: he told me that he thought um 'cause we kind of got off the the the topic that we were supposed to be talking about 

477.99 478.80 B: uh-huh 

478.42 487.36 A: and he said that you know he didn't think that they really cared what you talked about they just kinda wanted to he said he thought the study was about um 

487.33 496.56 A: you know your your voice patterns and and things of that nature he said they just they just wanna give you something to talk about so you don't just sit there on the telephone 

489.54 491.20 B: yes i believe so 

495.55 497.25 B: yes uh-huh 

496.80 503.70 A: so and that that kinda makes sense i don't really think they care if i like the outdoors or i like the cold weather [laughter] 

503.12 514.67 B: y- yes [laughter] i believe that's what is how you how you speak on the telephone that's the most important thing and how you are able to fill the questions that are asked because 

509.05 510.23 A: yeah probab- 

512.54 513.58 A: yeah 

514.84 518.54 B: you and i may have a opinion and someone else may have another 

518.12 519.30 A: right 

518.68 526.31 B: totally different from what w- uh we're talking about they move people move to different cities for jobs and things of that sort 

525.68 526.75 A: yeah 

526.19 535.56 B: what is- -ever's available in that city i moved here b- because i retired but you're here because you're in the military [laughter] there's always a reason 

530.77 531.71 A: right 

533.25 534.52 A: right 

535.04 536.24 A: exactly 

535.58 541.55 B: why people move or or live in a place for lots of time or live there forever 

541.48 544.63 A: well and this is a a neat place for us because 

544.70 549.47 A: um my family and my wife's family are both in alabama so 

548.70 549.72 B: oh yes 

549.48 556.13 A: uh we're you know for for once in my career we're really really close to you know the rest of our family 

555.59 556.51 B: uh-huh 

556.17 557.85 A: so that's been kinda nice 

557.36 558.97 B: when will you get out 

558.86 564.97 A: uh i've got at least uh i've been in for about ten years now so i've got at least ten more to go 

564.95 577.36 B: well my my my brother's son my nephew he's on the u._s. uh enterprise and they were the first ship to go out but now they're um at uh norfolk virginia 

576.79 577.94 A: oh really
