15.22 16.06 B: oh 

15.78 28.80 A: and the two questions that she said to address are whether you prefer cold weather or warm weather outdoor activities but then whether you prefer outdoor or indoor activities 

28.83 30.53 B: my gosh well 

32.10 35.62 A: i guess part of what makes it relevant is where you live

43.01 46.68 B: yes we do as a matter of fact the guy i talked to last night was in philly 

46.50 54.57 A: i i think that's because they ran they've been running ads recently um through the university of pennsylvania to do this 

50.91 52.08 B: (( oh huh )) 

53.91 55.97 B: oh oh i see okay

62.90 65.17 B: well personally i'm uh i'm 

65.21 72.75 B: i'm past the age of outdoor activities so i like [laughter] i like indoor activities games and cards and stuff like that

166.04 170.41 B: anymore um when i was at now when i was in miami i 

170.60 173.63 B: it was in the days when you could walk the streets

185.31 187.32 A: no i don't think i'd do 'em i actually 

187.13 201.58 A: i my girlfriend lives down in orlando but she lives in a gated community so we can walk out and leave her door unlocked and you know walk w- and it's large enough that you can put in the four miles that way here in the city

194.10 195.71 B: oh yeah that's excellent 

200.31 201.25 B: yeah 

201.47 211.49 A: if we're together we go up along um boathouse row by the philadelphia art museum and i don't know if you've ever seen the scene where we have all these there's rowing clubs along 

211.40 224.48 A: the scoocal river and there's lights on the outside they'll show it a lot like if they're broadcasting a sports event or something and they'll show the typical scenes um but i i wouldn't do that walk by myself 

213.12 213.94 B: (( uh-huh )) 

218.86 219.79 B: yeah 

221.98 223.69 B: i remember that bridge 

223.87 226.63 B: all i remember is that bridge with the lights on it 

226.14 234.54 A: yeah ben- the benjamin franklin bridge probably across the delaware river from philly to jersey i i can actually see that out of my apartment window

235.02 235.84 A: yeah 

238.10 245.58 B: and uh i would walk every day just to walk and i didn't know whether i was safe or not [laughter] so 

240.55 241.44 A: (( uh-huh )) 

244.23 258.87 A: well it's interesting center city are sort of laid out in a grid pattern that makes it fairly easy to do that but yeah from from one block to another you can be very nice and then go very bad and you need to know where you are 

256.45 258.61 B: yeah y- yeah 

258.62 259.87 B: right yeah 

259.15 268.08 A: but um but yeah yeah i i like tomorrow we're supposed to have a fairly nice day i'll probably go out and walk east towards the river 

267.85 268.78 B: yeah 

267.97 278.94 A: and then probably can go down back and maybe then go past more in the other direction they're they're sort of it was laid out with four squares that say writtenhouse square 

273.23 274.14 B: mhm 

277.18 278.06 B: (( mhm )) 

278.40 279.42 B: (( oh yeah )) 

278.81 292.69 A: it's it's kind of like saying um [lipsmack] oh yeah the nice uh buildings on central park in new york or something well writtenhouse square has all the nicest buildings that kind of thing or um so there's four squares 

285.49 286.41 B: yeah 

287.00 288.32 B: yeah oh 

288.34 289.46 B: oh i see 

292.74 301.85 A: that sort of are the four corners of center city in a way so you can walk down to the river towards one of the squares and then up in the other direction 

296.48 297.25 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

301.43 302.52 B: yeah 

301.88 306.64 A: and uh and you can make an hour's walk out of it if that's sort of your goal which is mine 

304.67 305.46 B: oh 

305.72 313.10 B: yeah yeah i uh recently of course i'm [cough] babysitting my mom now she's ninety six and i can't get 

313.07 321.70 B: i can't get much walking in so i said well mom i'm gonna walk around the house well ten times around the house is a mile like because it's a a large um 

318.86 319.80 A: oh okay 

321.70 330.42 B: yard and so that's what i been doing and [laughter] just trying to get my exercise in and it's um [lipsmack] walking around the house about forty times 

322.27 323.23 A: mhm 

330.05 331.01 A: right 

330.46 334.59 B: and by that time that's ten twenty that's about four miles and i'm done 

334.30 335.34 A: mhm 

334.98 346.75 B: but uh i i've got all of that i've got a treadmill i've got all kinds of exercise equipment over at my house which is just next door but if i go over there she misses me and she's not too well so [sigh] 

347.07 350.81 B: so i'm getting flabby and uh [laughter] 

349.62 353.90 A: [laughter] i've owned some of that kind of equipment it tended to turn into a clothes rack so 

353.10 355.01 B: yes yeah right 

354.10 355.74 A: much like a lot of people 

355.63 357.09 B: yeah i think so 

357.17 362.86 B: i i been trying to talk her into selling the farm and and letting us rent somewhere because 

363.50 369.12 B: we could be together all the time and and like you said they've got usually have equipment in um 

365.17 366.06 A: mhm 

369.77 373.93 B: in basements and things and and we could we could survive 

373.71 374.62 A: right 

374.48 375.70 B: but uh 

376.04 380.96 B: other than that uh with her i play cards like gusget bow or something simple 

380.43 382.07 A: yeah yeah 

381.12 382.85 B: to keep her counting 

382.67 383.61 A: right 

383.16 385.52 B: and uh keep her mind going 

385.27 390.73 A: uno's another good one 'cause you can use the numbers and the um the colors i like that 

388.47 401.95 B: yeah yeah yeah she had a stroke about four oh gosh i don't know how long ago now but i used skip though to bring her back to counting it was it was rough uh we had some people out here 

400.01 400.90 A: right 

401.96 413.00 B: trying to teach her trying to get her mind back but what they tried to get it back with i couldn't even do i said she can't figure that out and they said well she's gotta try i said she doesn't have to try 

407.44 408.46 A: yeah 

412.76 416.69 A: they have a card game version of monopoly now that uh 

415.74 416.76 B: oh they do 

416.92 429.05 A: is uh i don't know we got a real bright nine year old in the family that it was bought for and you know some of the nuances are a little bit i can't be bothered but the general idea 

421.30 422.12 B: uh-huh 

427.34 428.67 B: oh yeah 

428.86 431.94 A: because he understands how to play rummy 

431.56 432.48 B: yeah 

431.71 444.63 A: he understands the concept of trying to get the three orange properties or the three green properties but then there's sort of trading and discard piles and of a a little bit more sophisticated that that's a little 

435.38 437.78 B: oh yeah yeah uh 

439.87 441.72 B: oh [laughter] 

443.45 444.16 B: (( oh )) 

444.56 448.35 A: a little difficult sometimes but it does for us too so yeah 

447.39 452.18 B: yeah right i didn't know they had something like that that'd be okay that'd be fun

456.63 457.31 B: oh 

457.38 458.17 B: yeah 

459.47 465.47 A: did they also get him i wanna say a a card game version of clue and i don't even know if that one's been opened yet 

464.37 466.39 B: oh no kidding yeah i uh 

465.53 467.81 A: to start him with the monopoly version 

467.32 468.89 B: hadn't seen that either
