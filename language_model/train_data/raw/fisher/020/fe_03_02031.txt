232.38 233.50 B: (( well )) 

233.76 241.31 A: i'm i'm afraid i never was very good at fishing it's frustrating to do something that you are really bad at 

239.43 240.26 B: (( [noise] )) 

241.37 246.59 B: i usually [noise] go i don't like fishing i just sit there and watch them fish 'cause

251.78 254.42 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

253.15 263.72 A: oh well that's good see if you get some- something on the line then you feel like okay let's go back and do it again you know but just being outside and being together i'm sure is the big thing 

263.15 274.31 B: [noise] [noise] yes it is my husband he's a good fisherman [noise] [noise] he can go fishing and he [noise] catches most of the fish [laughter] [noise] and anybody else goes with him how do you do that how do you that like i don't know [noise] 

266.00 266.94 A: mhm 

269.16 270.26 A: yeah 

273.31 277.29 A: he must just know the right places to go where the fish are 

277.67 290.33 B: that and you have to know whenever they bite you have to know whether to leave it alone or let 'em take it or what [noise] to do and most time i get too excited and i just want to pull it in [laughter] [laughter] yeah [noise] 

284.05 285.04 A: ahah 

286.68 289.02 A: you want to reel it in right now 

289.08 291.86 A: yeah interesting interesting 

291.94 292.88 A: no 

292.77 303.96 A: and ah but you know where i live there are a number of lakes and rivers and people do go fishing here i used to work with a lady and they'd go fishing over the weekend they had a boat they'd go out in their boat 

303.84 309.87 A: and she'd come back and she'd say yeah we caught you know a hundred fish i'm going a hundred fish 

308.63 309.19 B: (( [noise] )) 

309.34 310.92 B: gosh 

310.20 324.39 A: yeah and and they they had fish in their freezer they had fish to eat all the time all the time because they caught so much every time they went you know it just it amazed me it just amazed me 

323.78 327.06 B: [laughter] that would be amazing to catch that many fish 

327.74 332.78 B: [mn] this is supposed to be the ca- fish capital of the world tennessee is and or the 

328.71 330.04 A: i know 

332.81 338.74 B: city that we live in but when we go fishing we catch maybe ten fifteen that's all we ever catch 

338.14 340.42 A: (( well that's still a lot of fish )) 

339.59 341.98 B: yeah that's still a lot of fish [laughter] 

341.05 350.78 A: you know i think that's pretty good i think i think that's very good you know the only time i ever caught a lot of fish was one time when i was a kid we went on vacation to canada 

350.94 364.23 A: and you rented like a boat and it came with a guide and all the fishing tackle and everything and this guy he knew where they were biting took you out in the boat to like the middle of the lake to me you know i was a kid who knew 

364.14 376.18 A: where we were going i don't know how he could find the same place more than once you threw your line in the water you got a fish you took the fish off you threw your line in the water you got a fish now that's fishing 

366.22 367.12 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

367.23 368.41 B: [laughter] 

375.56 380.98 B: [noise] yes it is that'd be really amazing to go fishing somewhere like that and 

380.44 381.65 A: (( ahah ahah )) 

381.05 382.44 B: fish like that 

381.67 385.48 A: i mean we caught all that you were allowed to catch in about twenty minutes 

385.17 386.46 B: oh my goodness 

386.30 390.26 A: yeah i mean it wasn't a lot it was like four fish per person you know 

390.15 393.32 B: [noise] [noise] that's still plenty for one [noise] person to catch 

392.49 396.00 A: yeah yeah it was a lot of fish 

395.54 396.31 B: [noise] 

396.05 398.44 A: so anyway it was um 

399.27 405.16 A: [mn] and it was after that you know any other fishing was just too disappointing 

404.97 406.15 B: (( uh-huh well )) 

406.27 407.42 A: yeah 

408.61 414.72 B: i know we live we got a little branch that runs beside our house it's not a creek or nothing it's just a little branch 

411.78 412.81 A: mhm 

413.96 415.01 A: yeah 

414.74 421.23 B: and sometimes in the summer time the kids get out there and play in it they just have to watch for the snakes [laughter] 

421.43 425.61 A: mhm mhm yeah are snakes a big problem where you live 

425.11 426.57 B: ah yes they are 

426.73 429.14 A: like poisonous snake- snakes 

428.14 428.84 B: um 

428.93 433.86 B: where we live at they have turned like five hundred rattlesnakes loose 

433.81 434.64 A: [mn] 

434.56 436.79 B: i think it's like three years ago they do it 

436.07 437.37 A: (( why )) 

437.06 441.41 B: to cut down on the rodent population on the mice and 

439.91 445.50 A: well okay now that part of it is good but couldn't they use some kind of other snake to do that 

445.19 449.52 B: no because rattlesnakes are the best snakes to [noise] catch the rodents 

449.24 454.37 A: i'm sorry but i think i could live with the rodents more than with poisonous snakes what about you 

450.43 452.21 B: [laughter] 

453.33 460.51 B: [noise] oh if we see 'em we try to kill them because i got kids and i don't want them to get hurt [noise] 

460.81 463.55 A: right by rattlesnakes exactly 

462.89 464.66 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

463.98 469.13 A: right i mean i mean i know rodents carry disease and all that kind of thing but 

469.14 474.73 A: um you know rattlesnake you get bit you're dead it's it's pretty straightforward you know 

473.75 476.45 B: [noise] well they had several little kids die [noise] from 

476.28 477.91 A: from the rattlesnakes 

477.30 478.66 B: yep 

477.93 482.54 A: what did some government agency do this this is like the weirdest thing i've ever heard 

481.98 490.72 B: um i don't know who had okayed it all i know is that it was in the newspaper in our local newspaper that they had turned loose like five hundred rattlesnakes 

487.77 488.54 A: that 

490.28 492.17 A: that just blows my mind 

492.33 493.04 B: [laughter] 

493.05 495.30 A: you know i just ah 

496.35 504.73 A: i i can't imagine such a thing because i thought there were like you know rat snakes i mean they call them rat snakes because hello they eat rats 

504.21 509.03 B: [noise] yep and they do have snakes that do good on eating those animals [noise] [noise] 

507.97 510.75 A: right and they don't and they are safe for people 

510.27 511.09 B: (( yep )) 

511.06 512.31 A: wow 

512.44 523.75 A: that that's just that is just really weird and so like at what point do they finally decide okay the rattlesnakes are more dangerous and try to round them up or do you you guys just have to suffer with it 

513.42 514.21 B: [noise] 

515.73 516.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

517.93 519.82 B: [noise] 

521.02 522.23 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

523.41 526.20 B: we just have to suffer with it we're not even supposed to kill 

525.90 528.25 A: which part of the state are you in again 

527.77 529.53 B: (( them we are in like the )) 

529.90 532.79 B: the southern part right by 

531.85 532.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

532.81 535.59 B: between alabama and mississippi [noise] 

534.98 543.70 A: okay i was just wondering 'cause i have some property in east tennessee and i mean i've seen some snakes there but nothing like that so 

543.86 553.00 A: wow i i just that is just the most amazing thing i have ever heard that they would send out rat a poisonous dangerous snake 

544.61 545.85 B: wow [laughter] 

551.45 552.52 B: [noise] snake 

552.65 553.64 B: yep 

553.45 557.35 A: just to deal with rodents i mean why not just send cats 

557.19 560.11 B: (( i know they need to send something else out there besides )) 

559.71 568.47 A: oh yeah there's a whole lot of other ways you can get rid of rodents wow i [mn] they must not have been thinking very clearly when they did that 

560.29 562.10 B: dangerous [noise] [noise] 

566.68 567.25 B: (( [noise] )) 

568.46 569.75 B: (( [noise] i don't [noise] )) 

568.84 572.30 A: i can't believe that people didn't rise up and complain 

572.39 582.53 B: well they turned them loose like up in a little it's an uncorporated place called alice hill and there's not very many people that live up there and it's mainly wooded area 

581.95 582.98 A: (( ahah )) 

582.73 585.94 B: so that's why they [noise] turned them loose up there but they know they're going to travel 

585.51 588.35 A: well of course and they're also going to breed 

586.91 587.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

587.76 588.84 B: (( yes )) 

589.16 597.09 A: wow this fascinates me this is just the strangest thing i have ever heard i feel so badly for you what a thing to have [noise] to live with 

591.87 592.82 B: [laughter] 

594.69 596.39 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

597.13 599.89 A: to know that at any [noise] time you know they're in your yard
