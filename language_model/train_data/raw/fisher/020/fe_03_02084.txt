117.03 118.26 B: um 

118.69 124.66 B: some people like my mom would say well the humidity gets to her whatever 'cause it gets muggy but uh 

124.00 124.71 A: oh 

125.36 133.03 B: it's not it doesn't get real hot i've lived in a place that's been really hot and you know some of the places are really cold but here it's kinda in between

127.49 128.38 A: [noise]

140.71 143.31 B: i i love indoor activities too so 

143.46 147.27 B: you know when it because it's raining so much i'd rather be inside 

147.40 153.48 B: and when it's sunny out i like going out and uh fixing up the garden or 

153.35 163.94 B: i like going for walks i guess that would be my favorite activity would be walking i like going out and walking the dog or walking with my kids so that's that's one of my favorites

185.22 186.46 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

186.03 187.35 A: and um 

187.71 189.99 A: and as far as um 

190.24 192.43 A: outdoor activities 

193.80 199.56 A: oh man [sigh] i don't know i like going to the park and walking around 

198.91 200.97 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

200.06 202.00 A: and um [lipsmack] 

202.12 204.74 A: i used to like riding my bike 

204.83 208.61 A: but it's not working right now [laughter] 

206.77 219.19 B: no [laughter] well i have a bike too but i haven't taken it out yet [laughter] so [laughter] this this year anyways but we have a park real close by and it's uh it's just got a small lake 

219.44 223.40 B: and uh it's really nice and so we i love going there 

223.55 224.59 A: yeah 

224.00 227.31 B: because it's got a playground for the kids so 

227.47 233.13 B: we can go out there it's got a large grassy area it's got an uh outdoor pool in summertime 

233.35 235.54 B: so we like going to the pool in summer 

233.53 234.88 A: oh yeah 

236.05 240.88 B: and it's a really great park you can have a picnic there and it's got 

239.95 241.65 A: oh that's nice 

241.16 245.89 B: yeah if you go all the way round it's about a forty five minute walk all the way around 

246.12 250.70 B: so it's really nice there's a lot of people that go out and use the park because of that 

251.15 255.83 B: it's a nice park so but then you know i think a lot of the preferences 

251.16 252.40 A: that's nice 

256.14 256.95 B: is 

257.05 264.44 B: has to do with uh the weather like you say you know when it's really cold or here when it's rainy that's when you 

259.91 260.87 A: right 

264.89 266.15 B: you do indoor 

266.93 271.50 B: indoor things you know like with my girls um i love playing cards 

271.82 272.84 A: yeah 

271.82 273.06 B: (( and so )) 

273.66 280.59 B: um we might have a another couple over and and play my husband and i and this other couple might play 

281.63 283.82 B: [sigh] some some games you know 

283.94 285.14 B: (( and uh )) 

285.52 292.14 B: or with the girls they're playing games like today we were uh putting a puzzle together one of those 3d puzzles 

291.54 293.71 A: oh yeah i like those 

292.57 300.05 B: and so yeah and so that kinda thing it's uh i think it depends on the weather [laughter] what we do 

300.14 308.40 A: yeah i um i i guess this would be considered an activity but i like i like going to sporting events 

308.17 309.11 B: oh 

309.32 310.54 B: mhm 

309.70 311.02 A: yeah 

311.12 320.56 A: um we're the town i live in is their home is has a college in it and we're fans of the college team and we go 

320.64 321.67 A: to 

321.79 329.61 A: football games basket basketball games um baseball games i mean we're always going to some sporting event 

329.35 330.77 B: right right 

330.18 332.64 A: and that's fun i like doing that 

334.51 339.40 B: [noise] well the- that's nice that's uh that's fun you know 

339.41 340.93 B: i haven't uh 

341.54 346.66 B: [sigh] i moved around a lot so i guess we've never really gotten into any particular sport 

346.61 347.88 A: mhm 

347.25 351.77 B: and so we really don't go a lot my husband isn't much into sports either so 

352.51 353.62 B: um 

354.14 358.58 B: we like going to the movies we like going to if there's a movie we like we'll go uh 

359.31 361.96 B: to a movie [sigh] um 

362.71 367.64 B: (( we're not that's about if we're not going out we're going out for a meal )) 

367.84 368.95 A: right 

368.48 373.56 B: and so i guess in that respect if if we go out at all it would be for camping or 

374.06 377.21 B: or um that would be in the summertime of course 

377.19 378.16 A: right 

378.57 381.05 A: we like camping also a lot 

378.83 379.47 B: (( so )) 

380.86 382.07 B: (( no [laughter] no )) 

382.14 383.60 A: we like to camp 

382.35 383.23 B: well 

383.40 385.46 B: it's a lot of uh it 

386.07 394.97 B: it depends what kind of camping you don't do but anyways it's not the same as staying at home and it is a big hassle but [laughter] that's true 

389.15 390.22 A: [laughter] 

392.84 393.90 A: [laughter] 

395.32 396.61 A: [laughter] 

395.78 397.02 B: but uh 

397.67 402.60 B: it is once you get uh all set up and you get there you wonder if it's worth it [laughter] 

402.04 407.50 A: yeah um you said movies my husband um 

408.17 417.88 A: is the manager of a a movie rental place and so so we do and- one of our big indoor activities is watching movies at home 

411.43 412.28 B: oh 

416.74 417.56 B: (( yep )) 

417.68 418.60 B: yep 

418.40 421.39 A: and i like doing that it's nice 

421.69 423.17 B: we do that a lot too 

423.05 426.43 A: yeah sit and relax and watch movies 

423.86 424.74 B: (( yeah )) 

426.76 436.53 B: you go and you pick up even some th- some that you watched before and enjoyed you know and and uh it turns out that you can relax and 

436.65 437.90 B: generally we get 

437.92 443.33 B: maybe one for the kids or one for us or if it's the weekend get a couple of each and that 

442.17 443.08 A: yeah 

444.19 445.82 B: that's enjoyable too 

446.02 447.42 A: yeah 

447.04 449.57 B: and so i guess that that's probably one of the 

450.22 454.85 B: entertainment fields you know that people do a lot lot of now 

454.86 456.37 A: yeah i know 

455.83 456.63 B: (( so )) 

457.30 463.80 B: you know unless we go out to go to a movie generally it would be only if there's a particular one we want to watch and it might be 

463.90 470.36 B: once a year or a couple of times a year if if there's particularly type we like you know 

470.37 471.60 A: right 

471.12 482.83 B: so that but we'll watch movies at home we watch them a lot you kind of wait wait around for for them to come out in video or d._v._d. to pick it up you know [laughter] 

482.17 490.00 A: i know we always wait for stuff to come out unless it's star wars we have to go and watch all the star wars movies on 

488.87 491.04 B: (( that's true yeah )) 

490.43 498.34 A: because of my husband i mean i like seeing 'em too but he says we have to go [laughter] 

491.93 492.85 B: (( [laughter] )) 

494.77 497.35 B: yeah [laughter]
