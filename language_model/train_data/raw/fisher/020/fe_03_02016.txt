64.23 65.03 B: mhm 

70.89 75.64 A: even like the scandals like my old job was on television for like 

75.72 88.59 A: scandals and stuff like that and um because they were like misusing and misappropriating funds and just everything and even they were like i think buying like their own stock and 

77.81 78.50 B: (( mm mm )) 

88.63 90.74 A: i mean it was just crazy 

90.81 91.40 B: (( mm )) 

90.81 98.17 A: so they were on television the higher ups in our organization were like on t._v. in new york getting arrested 

98.13 99.25 B: oh my 

98.64 106.69 A: so and they they were taking like taking them from their homes and stuff but they had a three million dollar golf course

114.60 116.81 B: uh-huh mhm hm 

115.96 124.50 A: but they had like a three million dollar golf course that they were building um it was a father and his sons and stuff like that 

124.57 130.23 A: and they were building like this golf course and they had all this money and you know it's just like 

130.50 137.08 A: they were misappropriating funds it was a family owned business and then they stepped down but the the 

137.10 140.65 A: way that they left the company i mean it was just like 

139.39 141.82 B: oh right it can never survive 

141.72 144.53 A: right so the company went in chapter eleven 

144.45 145.61 B: of course 

144.61 146.95 A: you know and then they had to step down 

147.25 159.78 A: but it's just like at that point you screwed up the lives of so many people i mean it's just like as far as like money is concerned you can only get a certain amount of raise and then after that you couldn't get a raise you know 

161.04 162.66 B: (( mm that's trifling )) 

162.69 165.29 A: yeah it it was really trifling and i just 

165.20 177.20 B: but you know you i come to expect actually big business it's a small when the small ones when small family owned ones are are corrupt that that kinda hurts a lot but i kinda expect like big business to be 

177.36 179.39 B: corrupt in some kind of way 

177.44 178.46 A: (( mhm )) 

179.42 180.35 B: (( yeah )) 

179.46 190.00 A: and they were like taking i mean and it had gotten to be so bad like say for instance they were like [laughter] keeping the money in the family and like the wife 

187.92 188.48 B: (( mm )) 

190.22 198.32 A: like say for instance like when they hired like when they ordered the um furniture for the offices like 'cause they had offices all over i mean just everywhere 

198.13 199.36 B: mhm 

198.46 204.43 A: so when they had the building i mean when they had the the offices and they wanted to furnish the new offices 

204.44 208.81 A: his wife had the furniture business and would furnish the offices 

207.61 210.65 B: oh my goodness that's so yeah right 

210.27 212.01 A: i mean so you 

210.77 212.34 B: (( how convenient how )) 

212.37 213.62 B: (( convenient )) 

213.44 217.25 A: right yeah how convenient if that but where did she get the business from 

217.33 221.55 A: (( of of the money that you made from the other business )) 

220.55 222.55 B: (( other business right )) 

221.77 225.50 A: so it's just like you're just taking money and reusing it and it 

224.93 226.05 B: right exactly 

225.61 228.72 A: just it's just circulating within the family 

228.23 230.74 B: that's right that's how the rich stay right 

231.11 236.18 A: how about that so and then it was just like and they was just i just felt like 

232.44 233.17 B: (( right )) 

236.19 243.55 A: poor com- you know i just i didn't want to work there anymore well i had the i found a new job recently so i'll be starting my new job on next week 

243.21 244.40 B: (( oh congratulations )) 

243.41 252.19 A: and today was my last day there but it's just like even with that then they came and told us okay well you can't you can only have a three per cent raise 

252.65 260.11 A: then they said okay well that's go ahead you know what just i'm sorry i'm driving i get road rage 

259.69 261.19 B: oh my god that's 

260.64 264.36 A: i'm sorry [laughter] but then they told us that um 

262.39 263.06 B: (( okay )) 

264.49 276.69 A: you can only have a three per cent raise and like we used to have a scoring system from like one to five then all of a sudden they said okay well you can't have a five any longer if you were rated a five 

270.16 271.50 B: (( mhm )) 

276.17 278.70 B: you didn't get your full three full three per cent 

279.00 280.42 A: i'm sorry 

280.05 283.46 B: if you didn't have a five then they didn't give you the full three per cent right 

283.26 290.61 A: right but listen this is the whole thing now well we used to go from like one to like maybe five per cent i think it was 

290.43 291.27 B: mhm 

290.59 301.30 A: so like i guess whatever you were rated was the percentage that you received then they said okay well you can't have above three per cent okay fine three per cent is the highest now they're saying 

294.26 295.10 B: right 

299.72 300.40 B: oh 

301.61 305.69 A: if you're a if you were rated a five which is like the top of the line 

304.97 306.62 B: perfect right uh-huh 

305.99 310.60 A: right if you were rated a five in your overall rating and your scoring 

310.56 324.15 A: then now you can only be a three no matter what so what is that saying to people who were once fives they become threes now and it makes it look seem or it makes it look as if they're doing less work like you're slacking 

322.54 325.04 B: (( it's less work right right )) 

324.33 336.85 A: so it's easier for them to get rid of you because they can go back and say okay well it looks like you've been slacking in your workload not that the people have been slacking but because they told us in our office you can only get a three 

330.33 332.01 B: right exactly 

335.87 337.67 B: get a three uh-huh 

337.08 341.58 A: so what about people who were threes and they were average so now they're ones 

340.51 343.41 B: people with the ones right they're gone 

343.27 345.03 A: (( yeah so it's like )) 

343.75 345.61 B: it's unbelievable 

345.25 356.93 A: it's a way to eliminate people and i really really think that it's unfair and something should be done about it and i think there are systems in place to protect to really protect the people you know 

355.90 367.76 B: yeah this is the point there should be some systems in place where you have some kinda some kinda say as as as but then that would be a union i guess and i don't like them too much either [laughter] 

366.13 366.97 A: (( yeah )) 

367.13 370.20 A: i think i would rather have a union i'm totally 

369.32 370.51 B: really 

370.37 382.40 A: yeah i mean working for um the organization that i worked for and what happened to us i think i would really rather have a union that way you have a mouth piece or somebody that's fighting for you 

382.37 386.89 A: you know and with something like this and actually i thought about it at one time 

386.99 397.80 A: um organizing a union in my job [laughter] i think oh god they're gonna fire me for sure like you can't get you can't get fired for starting a union you can't 

393.53 394.92 B: exactly 

397.06 400.63 B: no you can't but they can sure make your life freaking miserable 

400.45 402.84 A: yeah they now that they can do 

402.53 403.32 B: yeah 

402.86 407.16 A: fire you they can't but they can make you so miserable that you just want to leave 

406.58 407.98 B: leave right 

407.96 415.46 A: so i mean it's just like even the strength the changes and the restructuring of our company is the company is still in chapter eleven 

415.62 419.30 A: they haven't gotten out yet [noise] oh 

416.29 417.19 B: (( absolutely )) 

417.35 418.69 B: oh my goodness 

419.70 422.17 A: and it was in chapter eleven since last year 

422.63 423.99 B: oh my goodness 

423.45 424.86 A: so yeah 

424.11 431.70 B: so that was a smart move for you for you to get out so they really affected you you it i hope you got a job that was better 

431.53 434.09 A: ah yeah i did get a job that was better 

432.27 433.89 B: (( 'cause this economy is )) 

434.16 437.91 B: is very hard to find i don't know about in philly but i know up here 

438.31 439.94 B: it's very rough 

439.81 443.07 A: yeah how 'bout that i did 

441.44 443.11 B: (( trying to find a job )) 

443.15 446.03 A: i did find a job of course it was in jersey 

446.05 460.74 A: so now i have to drive to jersey but at least i did find a job but i had to get out of it i mean it was just it's pathetic i mean in the way that they do people and i really do there should be some kind of system or something in place 

446.59 447.82 B: (( oh god )) 

452.98 454.19 B: right right 

460.70 473.93 A: where people that are being affected by the changes and just the shady stuff that's done in these organizations can speak up and i mean it's okay good he got the people and like i mean like um 

474.57 485.35 A: like the people with enron and you know my company okay these people were arrested and they were seen on national television but yet and still what about the people 

481.50 482.45 B: right 

483.20 487.94 B: all those people that had that's right those people had lost all their pension money 

487.90 489.48 A: that's right 

487.95 491.12 B: all of the things what happens to them that's 

490.92 503.94 A: nothing i mean and then you're without a pension you're without any money you know you you had a life your life savings saved up and you're without that and then i mean it's just like what can they say oh sorry 

496.89 497.88 B: (( damn right )) 

502.48 508.53 B: oh we're sorry that's right we're sorry you can visit them in prison and torture them if that makes you feel better 

507.67 518.60 A: [laughter] but what good is that when you you had a million dollars or so saved up for your retirement and now you gotta work 'til like you're ninety five it's not right 

508.65 509.69 B: i mean 

516.83 517.72 B: (( mhm )) 

518.43 530.54 A: it's like what is in place to protect the people why do you i mean why do they do this you know and it really that really bothers me because i feel like okay good you get the shady people but 

530.74 543.85 A: on the flipside it's just like the the people that were working for these organizations it's like backlash they get everything i mean they just get all the backlash from it they're out of job 

543.85 544.86 B: that's right 

544.36 547.56 A: they don't you know their pension money is gone 

547.61 557.55 A: the company's in chapter eleven they can't get raises they can't get you know the um the amount of money that they they really deserve increases and stuff like that 

556.40 565.92 B: exactly that's what's disgusting you can't get any kind of raise and and they blaming everything on the economy but then you're like well but didn't you just get a new car and 

565.77 573.92 B: isn't that didn't you just buy a new house and didn't you just hire all of these your friends at high salaries but yet you're telling us 

573.90 581.32 B: that we can't get a raise 'cause that's what most companies is like oh we we're holding holding our raises holding um 

575.89 576.98 A: yep 

581.25 591.50 B: cost of living adjustment this you know this year and i'm like you can't hold it m._t._a. didn't hold it my grocery store's not holding it my rent isn't holding it
