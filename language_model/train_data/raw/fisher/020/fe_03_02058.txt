223.07 235.58 A: and when we sold the house ah a year before i retired i brought my bicycle down to manhattan with me and then that's i used to go down to the lower east side and you know on weekends it's quiet 

236.17 237.51 B: mhm 

236.75 238.67 A: i could get outside but 

239.56 251.79 A: it's it's it's a chore you know ah you can't just sort of stroll out your door you have to take the elevator and walk down halls and go in and out of doormen and things like that
