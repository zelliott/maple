97.99 98.55 B: (( [mn] )) 

100.88 107.92 A: ah how are we going to get businesses to conduct themselves in an ethical manner i think that's the real issue 

107.57 111.30 B: well actually i think it starts back with the way people are raised 

111.92 113.39 A: (( ah true )) 

112.71 114.99 B: morals values ethics 

115.01 116.39 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

115.45 116.60 B: character 

117.09 124.75 A: it goes all the way right right into government i mean even in my own little city that i live in i think there's corruption in its own little city hall 

125.20 128.30 B: oh i know i just went to a theatre and 

128.33 132.96 B: there was five posters that were just stolen last monday i mean 

133.14 134.67 B: give me a break 

134.45 135.96 A: (( mhm )) 

135.06 137.95 B: inside the theatre and outside 

137.80 139.23 A: mm i hear you 

139.24 140.74 A: um 

139.81 145.19 B: and and you're talking corporate now i mean and corporate's even more complicated 

145.06 146.69 A: mhm mhm 

145.73 149.05 B: because you're dealing with the multi factions here 

148.88 149.88 A: mhm 

149.07 152.15 B: multi levels you're dealing with ah 

152.22 157.41 B: access situations here unauthorized access and so on 

156.54 159.96 A: it's all about ethics and morality and 

160.22 161.88 A: you know [sigh] 

162.13 175.51 A: i mean if they're going to really cheat just how well can they cheat if they're going to hide how well can they hide doesn't the government hide and cheat behind our back 

177.03 179.68 B: yeah we're not supposed to get into that subject though 

179.96 183.04 A: well isn't the subject about monitoring 

183.40 186.32 B: well it's about corporates though 

186.59 191.20 B: and i don't really think that we can do enough to 

191.79 193.84 B: secure ourselves 

194.90 200.32 B: or monitor ourselves i think it really has to do with the human person themselves 

200.60 201.72 A: well 

200.68 206.25 B: and how they're raised um it doesn't matter you got hackers you've got 

206.51 212.89 B: i mean no matter how much security you put up someone's going to get in it it's a challenge 

213.69 214.82 A: i agree 

214.97 217.71 B: if you deal with a person individually 

217.79 219.66 B: on how they're raised 

220.25 222.16 B: it's like my husband said 

222.36 229.65 B: my husband got fired ah a couple years ago and he said and he was management and 

230.24 233.73 B: he goes you know i train my people to be better than i am 

234.16 235.58 B: what does that tell you 

237.33 239.71 A: i don't know i'm listening that 

239.46 243.31 B: well if you consider that if you're a manager [mn] 

244.13 249.06 B: and you want the best for the people that are under you and you're willing to 

249.26 254.55 B: sacrifice yourself he f- got was fired because he would not fire someone else 

254.87 256.12 A: (( mm mm [lipsmack] [noise] )) 

255.28 260.07 B: because there was a pet peeve between upper management about him and this person 

260.26 265.14 B: and they were finding any way to axe him and and my husband stepped in and said no 

265.93 267.04 A: (( mm )) 

267.47 269.19 B: just like that 

269.27 274.95 B: did it several times and they didn't like it and so they fired him and told him that he wasn't 

274.97 277.90 B: he wasn't supporting the corporate 

278.81 280.02 B: unity 

280.50 281.67 B: and so 

282.51 285.77 B: in washington you don't have to have a reason to fire 

282.60 283.81 A: well 

286.40 287.22 A: (( hm )) 

287.17 290.22 B: but see that gets you right there i mean 

287.50 288.66 A: that's terrible 

291.30 297.43 B: our companies are just as corrupt it's a buck and it comes down to just a buck 

298.57 299.92 B: so people 

298.58 301.68 A: yes you're right you're right absolutely right 

301.04 306.04 B: i mean let's get i mean you might as well get to the root of the problem not 

306.15 307.98 B: what the symptoms of it 

308.16 310.49 B: corruption is the symptoms right 

310.37 311.96 A: absolutely 

312.30 316.29 B: so how do you affect it you've got to start small 

316.75 320.23 A: [mn] right it all starts at the beginning doesn't it 

319.63 324.31 B: yeah it really does i don't care how you look at it it really does 

324.93 334.53 B: and it doesn't matter what raise what situation you're in morals character ethics all these things 

334.73 336.08 B: are 

336.49 337.49 B: taught 

337.76 339.03 A: mhm 

339.10 344.50 A: i have a friend who has a s- ah a son who's i think in grade seven 

344.62 346.32 A: and he was raising 

345.13 346.52 B: i have one in eight 

346.51 347.43 A: (( oh )) 

346.89 348.00 B: a daughter 

347.80 360.82 A: well he was raising marijuana in his bedroom so that he can buy a four thousand dollar laptop first of all why does he even need a four thousand dollar laptop 

350.68 351.85 B: oh my goodness 

361.33 362.92 A: is the question 

363.30 371.09 A: and ah there are better ways to raise money than to 

371.12 373.43 A: grow marijuana to sell it 

373.10 377.20 B: yeah but if you had a good relationship with your child i would think 

377.53 378.97 B: you would know 

378.56 384.54 A: right exactly his his mother had no idea till he started to sell 

379.06 380.60 B: they were doing that 

382.60 383.79 B: there's there's 

384.38 390.59 B: see and there you go from generations yeah and it goes from generation to generation 

385.52 387.86 A: (( it and that's how the corruption starts )) 

390.56 392.51 A: exactly 

390.65 396.52 B: and it and that's how it is effect we can't get any better if we don't start at the beginning 

396.42 397.54 A: (( mhm )) 

396.72 404.35 B: our family unit but then i'm dealing religiously also in the sense of i'm a non-denominational um 

404.38 406.82 B: believer and ah 

407.49 420.42 B: i i really feel we have to take some of the responsibility ourselves we can't keep it off on our parents and and everyone else yes so what i had a bad rough background so i've had rough times 

420.49 424.09 B: that doesn't give me any excuse am i willing to change 

424.89 426.44 B: i have that choice 

425.17 425.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

426.25 429.68 A: well change is hard though you have to work at it but 

428.82 430.53 B: you have to want to

454.07 456.54 A: you've got to put the work in and the effort 

457.09 460.71 B: but how do we stop corporate co- corruption and so on 

461.29 467.42 A: well first of all we have to have a public awareness of it we've got to be aware of it and start at the beginning the root of it [mn] 

467.67 471.23 A: early on in childhood in our upbringing 

469.70 470.44 B: mm 

472.06 475.24 B: and how it affects and how it's a rippling effect 

475.18 478.56 A: that's right from generation to generation to generation
