405.32 413.75 A: well that's the thing it's really funny because you just really get to know like how like you know with that first scene when he's looking in the window of glen and glenda and he just kind of stops and he looks and he's like 

411.64 412.56 B: (( yeah )) 

413.52 423.89 A: and like he literally like johnny depp does this scene where they do it and it's like one shot and he's like and it's a horrible shot and he's like that was perfect you know [laughter] and they move on because he was just so crazy 

420.77 422.97 B: [laughter] 

423.43 430.41 B: he must have been a nut i swear to god he must have been really really a nut [laughter] because [laughter] 

430.46 437.48 B: i can't understand how they ever did these things [laughter] why they spent so many thousands of dollars to do these things 

433.49 435.97 A: i believe he got funding 

436.82 442.28 A: that's what i mean i c- i was actually surprised he got the funding especially during that time now it's a little bit easier 

442.33 447.96 A: because i mean it's so low budget but back then you know six seven thousand dollars is a lot of money 

447.23 451.54 B: yeah they were talking about for christine jorgensen something about a 

450.71 452.12 A: yes

467.75 470.33 B: i have to admit though men are pretty weird 

469.75 472.18 A: yeah they do a lot of weird stuff it's very true 

471.32 472.86 B: well i can't understand who would 

473.05 480.18 B: actually consider it to be a wonderful thing to wear a roo- a noose around their neck and that that's what men do with ties every day 

480.46 481.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

480.66 481.86 B: (( it's a noose )) 

481.42 487.31 A: [mn] well you know women we do it with the heels i mean it's just a different it's just a different form of torture [laughter] 

483.73 485.16 B: oh that's horrible 

486.69 488.51 B: it sure is 

488.24 497.52 A: i never get that you know actually my foot condition my doctor's like oh if you wore high heels it wouldn't have happened i'm like no but then i would have a knee and back problem so what would be the difference 

495.96 497.01 B: yeah 

497.12 498.33 B: yeah you would 

498.13 499.09 A: (( you know )) 

498.47 501.46 B: yeah it depends on your body style too because um 

502.34 504.81 B: foot injuries could be caused by so many different things 

504.09 507.64 A: well mine is because i have flat feet so that's why a heel would be 

507.36 508.36 B: yeah 

508.10 510.09 A: it would be good but i'm not putting them on 

509.98 510.88 B: (( no )) 

510.57 515.24 A: [laughter] when i was around twenty one i decided i will never wear heels again [laughter] 

514.94 516.44 B: no they're painful 

515.87 517.33 A: (( they are really painful )) 

517.10 523.08 B: i just can't believe that they they they push all the weight into the front of your foot then you have a bunion 

522.89 525.37 A: yep or you get a neuroma 

523.68 524.93 B: or a corn 

526.38 529.55 A: which is where the ner- the the bones rub against the nerve 

526.39 527.17 B: yeah 

529.10 530.89 B: yeah oh it's painful 

530.46 531.53 A: yeah 

532.02 537.26 A: so how about warm or cold do you which one do you prefer i mean obviously we're in the east 

534.21 538.07 B: well i was in florida one time did you ever go to florida 

537.53 541.33 A: i lived down there for a while right after college because i love the warm 

539.70 541.55 B: i lived there for nine months 

541.54 543.86 A: you did i lived for like ten [mn] 

543.39 545.22 B: oh my god isn't that weird 

543.94 546.48 A: this is like a very alternate reality [laughter] 

545.35 549.66 B: [laughter] that is a strange coincidence isn't it 

549.00 551.11 A: yeah did you like it down there though 

550.88 552.81 B: well my sister lives down there 

553.00 558.35 B: so i had a nervous breakdown so how do you like like it when you have a nervous breakdown right [laughter] but um 

557.16 558.30 A: yeah well 

558.64 561.23 B: i i think i think i 

558.67 561.81 A: at least they're friendly down in florida the people are nice 

561.54 574.62 B: these people are nice the churches are nice down there there's a lot of fun bike trails down there there's a lot of things you could do there's like a boardwalk everywhere down there whereas up up in new jersey it's like it's very seasonal 

574.36 575.43 A: yeah 

574.60 577.66 B: because because it's warm all the time you could do so much 

576.62 577.99 A: exactly 

578.83 581.62 B: but and your body does get used to the heat 

581.04 594.85 A: yeah i mean people are like oh i can't b- i was there that summer when there was all the fires and they're like weren't you hot i was like no it was like a hundred degrees i mean you get used to it if you're if you're if you're winter is seventy degrees going to a hundred's not that big of a change 

594.12 599.89 B: no no it does and and and i was really close to the gulf the gulf bea- 

595.50 596.35 A: yeah
