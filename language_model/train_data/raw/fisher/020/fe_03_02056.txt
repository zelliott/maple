237.20 240.76 A: spring is having a hard time making it this year 

240.39 241.92 B: yeah 

241.40 244.89 A: so ah i don't know if that was the same with you and we haven't 

244.01 250.86 B: well it's been kind of cool here in fact we had the heat on you know in the house for a couple of days now 

249.36 250.27 A: okay 

251.02 252.10 B: and ah 

251.07 252.13 A: (( oh okay )) 

252.11 254.09 B: but it's been nice you know 

254.76 262.37 A: i guess you know what i think the most important thing that i'm learning because the changes in weathers are so unpredictable 

261.95 263.09 B: mhm 

262.81 265.94 A: is that not to expect anything 

266.13 276.23 A: and go with the flow and when i do that i don't i guess i get more in tune with the weather that we have and i don't resent any weather so much 

275.37 276.36 B: mhm 

276.79 281.46 A: ah it doesn't mean that i don't get fed up a bit but much much less than i used to 

281.57 288.42 A: and i think it's because it's so unpredictable like i used to say it's not supposed to be doing this at this time of the year 

288.04 289.48 B: yeah yeah 

288.64 290.77 A: and i would get angry at that 

290.68 293.32 B: well now here it's almost may 

293.37 295.90 B: and you know it's cool 

293.62 294.58 A: yeah 

295.82 303.82 A: i know it's not it's not the normal weather it's not it's certainly not the norm- i don't think we can expect normal any more or there's no such thing as normal any more 

297.96 299.13 B: mhm 

303.17 306.54 B: well i always say it's from going up to the moon [laughter] 

305.78 308.48 A: it's going up to the what's going up to the moon 

307.89 311.00 B: [laughter] you know going up there and messing arou- 

309.87 311.52 A: we're all going up there 

311.22 312.31 B: [laughter] 

311.91 313.37 A: is that what you said 

312.80 319.46 B: no ah [laughter] it's like messing around up there with the atmos- atmosphere 

314.44 315.88 A: oh okay 

317.64 322.54 A: oh it's because of the it's because of ah us sent you know sending people to the moon 

322.27 323.57 B: yeah [laughter] 

322.96 325.79 A: (( in ah as space that's ah )) 

325.09 327.90 B: space yeah i think that's affecting the weather 

327.61 330.84 A: it could possibly be i mean you know 

329.51 330.43 B: mhm 

330.53 335.14 B: i've heard a lot of people say that you know i know they have to do it and everything 

335.72 338.40 B: like that but ah you never know 

337.39 342.83 A: oh i'm sure it has effect because i think all the universe is connected and everything has ah 

341.67 342.77 B: mhm 

343.08 350.75 A: has some bearing on each other you know we're we are all connected in some way or other so it has to affect us like ah 

344.91 345.48 B: (( mm )) 

347.01 348.19 B: oh sure 

350.83 357.09 A: going for oil in the ground must affect the earth somehow it has to i mean you know it's 

353.86 355.05 B: mhm 

357.25 358.97 A: in my mind anyway 

358.67 359.63 B: mhm 

358.98 364.03 A: in my brain it does ah it has to have an effect so ah 

363.84 364.73 B: yeah 

364.12 365.88 A: you're probably right 

366.06 367.47 B: you never know 

366.27 367.06 A: that 

367.16 371.07 A: you never know and ah unfortunately i don't think anybody knows 

371.07 371.97 B: no 

371.74 375.07 A: we always know too late the consequences of our actions 

374.97 378.62 B: mhm would you like to go up there being an astronaut 

379.04 385.55 A: ah now that would be really really be an outdoor activity wouldn't it [laughter] 

383.17 386.17 B: it sure would [laughter] 

385.70 389.39 A: actually i'm adventurous enough to say yes 

389.30 390.45 B: mhm 

389.49 395.62 A: i would i think ah that would be the ultimate outdoor activity i think um 

393.25 394.06 B: yeah 

395.91 400.56 A: so i think you know wh- what i think one day it will probably happen 

400.50 401.46 B: mhm 

400.57 406.92 A: there will be peop- you know on a regular basis that would be one of our choices as an outdoor activity 

404.90 406.19 B: yeah i think 

406.47 408.85 B: and sky diving you know [laughter] 

408.01 412.68 A: yeah but that's not going to be in my life time i think [laughter] no i

413.41 425.99 A: oh i well not well sky diving i haven't done i haven't even done it from a plane yet so i'm not too sure about the other but i don't know if ah you know if you could just kind of float like you see the anti gravity and just ah 

418.70 421.15 B: [laughter] 

425.64 426.71 B: yeah 

426.13 430.85 A: and kind of control where you're go not just go out in outer space and just float there for the rest of your life 

430.47 431.73 B: mhm 

431.07 432.16 A: (( but ah )) 

432.21 438.88 A: yeah it's ah it's fascinating when you really start thinking about indoors and outdoors it brings all kinds of thought 

438.37 440.50 B: that's right mhm 

439.24 448.01 A: you know just even the gravity that we're we're held to the ground i mean it's a ball it's round and we don't fall off [laughter] it's [mn] it's 

442.36 443.39 B: mhm
