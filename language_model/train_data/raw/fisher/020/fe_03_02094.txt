110.11 111.33 B: um

172.26 181.28 B: kind of unusual circumstances we were both at a garage sale and we happened to have kids that were the same age real young 

181.26 188.15 B: and we just started talking and from then on we were friends [laughter] just i mean it's 

188.23 196.84 B: it's not the way you really expect to make a friend but we felt a connection right away it was just something that drew 

197.56 199.37 B: us to each other 

200.96 201.92 B: um 

204.53 209.51 A: mm that's kind of what i have i've got two two people like that

228.35 229.97 B: i it's just 

230.92 236.92 B: we can not talk to each other for months and we just pick up the phone and it's like we've never been apart 

237.25 243.03 B: so and we used to live real close together we were within a block of each other 

243.67 251.49 B: but now we're [laughter] i don't know i'm trying to think how many miles it is eighty miles i guess so 

251.28 252.59 A: that's a ways 

252.13 255.66 B: yeah that's a ways but we keep in contact so 

256.83 259.26 A: so friendship's uh it's 

259.27 262.42 A: so do you have different categories of friendship 

262.79 267.41 B: uh yes definitely definitely um 

263.63 266.23 A: i do [laughter] 

267.73 274.11 B: my family says that i can i can get someone's life story out of them 

274.27 280.55 B: within about [laughter] five minutes usually just by walking up to them i just i really tune into people 

280.59 281.86 A: (( so do i )) 

281.36 285.06 B: but that doesn't mean that um 

285.63 290.47 B: they're necessarily friends i'm just interested in people 

291.93 293.35 B: so [laughter] 

292.57 293.91 A: so casual 

294.17 295.06 B: pardon 

295.21 296.44 A: casual 

296.29 304.92 B: right right and it's not that i'm not interested only i just don't have as close a relationship with them as you would a real good friend 

307.37 310.07 B: uh let's see [laughter] 

311.89 313.56 A: well i'm the same way 

313.65 318.83 A: um exactly actually i actually have these little categories 

316.17 316.86 B: mm 

318.54 319.65 B: right 

319.56 328.34 A: that uh you have where you have the hi and goodbye friend it's not really a friend it's more of an acquaintance and then i've got the 

323.48 324.48 B: right 

326.87 327.86 B: right 

329.76 331.29 A: the um 

332.33 334.10 A: (( [noise] here's your pen )) 

334.07 336.07 B: [laughter] 

336.17 337.66 A: and then uh 

337.98 339.94 A: i've got the uh 

341.59 344.64 A: oh you get together once in a blue moon 

344.74 352.69 A: kind of friend it's not really someone that uh you can trust a hundred percent with everything 

345.92 346.99 B: right 

352.93 354.50 A: then i've got your 

355.67 357.53 A: closer friends 

357.81 361.37 A: that when you're in a pinch or you need some help then uh 

361.62 370.96 A: they're there and then you have your really best friends that uh no matter what you do say or whatever they're always still going to be your friends 

362.71 363.75 B: right 

370.39 371.75 B: that's right 

372.74 376.31 A: i've got these like categories it's terrible but i do [laughter] 

374.64 381.92 B: yeah yeah [laughter] oh i don't think it's so bad i mean each each one meets a different need 

381.83 383.15 A: mhm 

382.33 383.29 B: um 

383.92 386.85 B: because i have i have other friends that i see 

387.81 388.94 B: but 

389.61 397.32 B: we don't have the emotional connection that a couple of my friends and i do um 

399.38 403.64 B: [laughter] i think sometimes it's because 

404.38 405.76 B: um 

407.00 408.46 B: some people 

410.36 414.97 B: have a hard time being a real friend um hm how do i say 

414.37 415.39 A: (( [noise] love )) 

415.98 425.18 B: well i've got one that i'm thinking of [laughter] in particular that's been a friend for a long time and we kind of grew through our kids again and um 

425.35 437.27 B: we've kind of grown apart and i still care about her but in in the past several years she i think she's had so many problems that she's kind of 

437.74 442.60 B: um she can't seem to relate to other friends anymore 

442.70 443.69 A: mm 

443.44 445.68 B: and she's kind of 

445.98 451.32 B: i think because of the emotional problems she has found her own little world 

452.06 453.98 B: and it doesn't include 

454.58 459.60 B: her friends it includes people that she's working with 

460.17 462.81 B: however it's not a true friendship 

463.48 465.95 A: so she feels safer than getting 

463.69 465.21 B: she's kind of absorbing 

466.80 467.93 A: close 

468.39 469.41 B: right 

469.69 472.01 B: right she's grown away from 

473.53 478.72 B: from her other friends and she's absorbed herself so much in her work 

479.99 482.15 B: that she doesn't seem to have time 

482.82 485.09 B: um for friends anymore 

486.56 487.88 A: yeah 

487.25 488.78 B: [laughter] 

487.92 491.82 A: well some people just kind of they have their levels their walls 

490.88 492.50 B: right right 

492.14 494.99 A: you know they don't want to 

492.94 493.79 B: right 

495.41 504.24 A: they can't handle any more and so they just kind of keep those walls up and just want to float through life without having any hassles 

497.14 498.04 B: yeah 

500.28 501.42 B: yeah 

502.51 503.48 B: yeah 

503.91 504.67 B: yeah 

505.03 506.61 A: sound about right 

505.89 509.38 B: and no connections [laughter] right right 

507.83 512.49 A: yeah well you don't grow with those 'cause a friendship is like a marriage 

511.93 514.97 B: the friendship kind of dies um 

515.09 519.21 B: we call each other once in a while to to um 

520.73 528.11 B: try to stay in or i call her to to let her know about other friends and things that are happening in their lives and things but 

528.22 530.22 B: there really isn't any 

531.40 533.34 B: uh real connection 

532.45 533.01 A: (( [mn] )) 

534.38 535.82 B: so [laughter] 

535.38 537.68 A: so there isn't a depth to it then 

537.15 548.72 B: not like there used to be right and then i have friends that i just like to run that i run into and you visit and you kind of catch up on things but you never really get together much 

550.39 552.83 B: and you still care about them 

550.42 551.47 A: yeah 

553.11 560.05 B: but it's it's like your your your lives are paralleling or you know you never [laughter] 

560.23 566.88 B: just because you're all busy and you know but you still care about them on a different level 

567.03 568.29 A: mhm 

568.71 570.71 A: and you want what's best for 'em 

569.66 573.29 B: yeah that's right [laughter] 

572.63 574.96 A: yeah i can understand that 

573.75 575.28 B: yeah yeah 

576.04 577.35 A: but uh 

578.47 585.12 A: yeah we do have different levels of friendship it it's kind of sad but uh 

580.76 582.16 B: definitely 

585.33 591.29 A: we all have our baggage i guess you'd say and because of that then uh 

587.76 589.32 B: right right 

593.40 594.83 A: then um 

596.34 599.89 A: you just uh you have to get through the walls sometimes
