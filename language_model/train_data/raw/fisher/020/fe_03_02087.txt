33.91 34.98 A: (( but um ))

43.28 44.05 A: (( son's )) 

46.07 49.23 A: (( friend um and um )) 

49.66 50.60 A: so 

51.42 55.44 A: i can make friends easily but they're not real close friends 

55.72 56.80 B: right 

56.70 58.11 A: and um 

58.28 64.87 B: i think that happens as we get older too you know it seems harder um the older i get to um you know 

58.53 60.00 A: [noise] 

65.38 66.59 B: keep the 

66.61 74.14 B: best friend that maybe you had for a long time and it seems like you can't the relationships don't get as close as they did when we were younger 

67.51 70.50 A: [noise] 

71.73 73.28 A: [noise] 

73.98 76.16 A: (( right i think i think )) 

74.66 78.84 B: you have less time for friends [laughter] that's what i find 

77.60 80.42 A: (( [noise] i think it's harder to i'm sorry )) 

80.27 81.24 B: that's okay 

81.86 84.00 A: i think that it's harder to 

84.94 85.78 A: (( um )) 

85.79 90.16 A: keep friends in this day and age and [noise] close friends because 

90.38 92.40 A: (( life is just so hectic [noise] )) 

92.09 93.43 B: right 

92.47 95.21 A: (( and you're and )) 

95.62 97.74 A: you're trying to 

97.89 98.76 A: (( um )) 

98.94 103.29 A: do things with your family get you know your life in order 

103.32 108.55 A: and it seems like a day's gone before you realize that you can't even keep in touch with anyone 

108.66 109.66 B: right 

109.83 110.59 A: so 

110.02 119.72 B: i know and um with us we move a lot but i know that like i have i have three very close friends that um no matter where i move 

120.70 135.41 B: i've always been in touch with them and um even if we're not in the same state for a while or whatever we you know we talk on the phone at least once a month and it seems like our friendship never changes and when we do get together it seems like we've been together every day you know because we have so much in common 

133.41 134.25 A: right 

135.54 140.69 B: and then other than that i feel like everybody else is just kinda acquaintances coming and going and you know 

140.65 143.07 A: right that's basically how 

143.24 147.27 A: it is with except i've stayed in the same place and my friends have moved 

147.21 148.06 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

147.58 150.47 A: [laughter] and so it's like 

150.59 155.99 A: i've been in the same town for almost thirty years and it's just like 

156.68 161.70 A: everyone else moves away and we um [lipsmack] 

162.03 171.89 A: we keep in contact somewhat the ones that i keep in closest contact with seem to be the ones that are like sisters you know 

171.60 172.58 B: right 

172.75 174.67 A: they um they're 

175.09 183.89 A: really only two that i've kept in such close contact with that it hasn't there hasn't been a lull in our relationship 

184.01 188.36 A: and then one that has stayed living here in town with me so 

188.41 194.93 A: she's over at my house every weekend and it just and we do anything for each other and 

195.40 200.09 A: if i have a problem with my children i know she'll take care of it if i can't 

200.27 201.20 B: right 

201.06 201.77 A: (( uh )) 

202.86 205.20 B: yeah i um that's how it is 

205.32 211.43 B: i usually find um [sigh] well we do move a lot and so when we get into a new new area 

211.46 224.90 B: you know it usually takes me about maybe six to eight months sometimes a year to really develop a close friend in town that you know like you're together with all the time and you know watch each other's kids and you know do things together and so forth 

224.86 233.00 B: and then we end up moving [laughter] and i usually keep in touch with that person for probably about a year afterwards and then it seems like it just fizzles 

233.08 237.51 B: but then i have these lifelong friends who you know i've spent you know 

237.53 242.01 B: like my friend that we went to missionary training school together and we lived together for several years and 

242.03 250.36 B: and we talk on the phone every single month and we see each other maybe every two years but we're just so close because we went through so much together for such a long time 

250.32 251.39 A: right 

251.18 258.69 B: so i know that i always have those lifelong friends that i can call you know and that i have a very close family so my sisters are always around 

258.79 260.82 B: but um as far as you know 

261.36 265.29 B: [lipsmack] making friends and holding friends and best friends and stuff seems like 

265.59 268.72 B: i have a long list of [laughter] 

268.61 270.34 A: (( right best )) 

269.61 272.08 B: most are former friends [laughter] 

270.93 274.19 A: right that's very interesting because i have um 

274.21 282.79 A: four brothers and two of 'em i'm very close to and we do things together all the time more so than i would would friends 

280.15 280.72 B: (( [noise] )) 

283.14 286.21 A: you know outside the family friends 

285.57 286.53 B: right 

286.41 291.41 A: and because i consider them as two of my best friends 

291.06 292.12 B: right 

291.70 293.29 A: and um 

294.22 299.91 A: this girl that i went to college with was like your brothers can't be your friends [laughter] and i 

299.94 303.68 A: was like they are the people that are always there for you 

303.66 304.87 B: yeah 

304.51 310.10 A: and um your brothers are your protective you know they are protectors they protect you 

310.70 314.23 A: no matter what you know it doesn't matter if 

314.24 319.09 A: the person picking on your is twenty times their size they're going to defend you 

319.62 320.33 A: so 

320.54 323.49 B: i never had a brother i had four sisters [laughter] 

322.21 323.31 A: oh [laughter] 

323.56 326.20 A: yeah i always wanted a sister they'd um 

326.37 327.63 A: i guess that's 

327.72 329.62 A: why they um 

329.66 331.79 A: girls that i did stay close to 

332.68 333.49 A: (( um )) 

334.05 337.12 A: they're families were similar to mine so it was like 

337.33 340.37 A: and they became close to my parents 

340.41 342.97 A: so it was like we were sisters 

341.65 343.50 B: [noise] 

344.20 345.11 A: they 

344.94 346.44 B: right [noise] [noise] 

347.61 351.61 A: and they don't have sisters they have brothers also [laughter] so 

352.26 356.07 A: i just you're kind of attracted to the same kinda people 

356.75 358.60 A: or you know like 

358.77 361.51 A: you're family members or yourself 

361.12 365.28 B: right people who have the same kinda uh values and ideas and 

364.87 366.00 A: right 

365.46 367.70 B: yeah i tend to look for um 

368.57 373.63 B: you know to spend time with people that raise their children the same way as i do 

373.30 374.76 A: yeah right [laughter] 

374.04 377.33 B: you know so then we all well 'cause i have four and when we're all you know 

376.48 379.57 A: i do too [laughter] yeah 

377.44 378.42 B: (( oh do you )) 

379.10 380.09 B: and uh 

380.65 383.63 B: so when we get together and stuff you know on a 

383.92 386.51 B: it's hard if you get together with someone 

386.84 392.15 B: the don't last as long if they're raising their children extremely different than yours you know 

391.21 393.00 A: or if they don't have children 

393.19 394.60 B: oh yours don't have children 

394.37 407.51 A: no i'm saying oh they they don't like one of my friends yeah like my very best friend she doesn't have children but she treats my children like hers and she knows what my values are and she's not going to 

396.00 398.29 B: oh right or if they don't have children 

407.48 409.44 A: talk against those 

408.78 410.24 B: right 

409.62 415.98 A: they there are people that i've befriended and i thought we could be good friends but 

416.18 429.98 A: my children have got in in the way it's in their viewpoint because they didn't have kids and so they were jealous of my kids because they were taking me away from that relationship and um you know so 

420.17 421.14 B: right 

427.57 428.50 B: right 

429.98 431.63 B: (( and )) 

430.89 432.43 A: and the 

433.13 435.87 B: i know children take a lot of time 

435.50 436.77 A: right 

436.09 437.06 B: you know 

437.49 441.85 B: so i'm not as free as others to get together and do you know 

442.34 444.53 B: can't get together with friends as often 

444.39 445.53 A: (( right )) 

444.62 446.29 B: when you have smaller children 

446.60 448.19 A: and it's um 

448.46 452.39 A: like playgroups and stuff like that are really cool because then you can 

452.66 456.04 A: see other people in your same situation 

455.88 457.34 B: right 

456.60 457.54 A: (( you can )) 

457.86 462.69 A: and they may just stay acquaintances they they're still acquaintances that you can 

462.76 466.21 A: kinda you can talk to and relate to on 

466.67 469.12 A: on that those grounds you know 

470.20 473.88 B: this is true yeah i yeah some of my good friends that 

474.44 476.13 B: i've met in playgroup 

476.17 480.65 B: and then in church i've spent a lot of [laughter] time in church nursery [laughter] 

479.70 484.62 A: right that well [laughter] and it's because your kids are all the same age so 

484.88 488.01 A: you're going to be able to communicate better that way 

488.03 489.04 B: right 

489.56 490.80 A: so are you 

490.87 493.48 A: is your family in the military or what do you 

492.73 505.25 B: no we just move a lot [laughter] we get asked that often but we just we just move a lot for different opportunities and seems like we come back and forth to chicago though we spent quite a bit of time in chicago that's where i'm from 

494.21 495.78 A: (( oh okay [laughter] )) 

500.37 501.26 A: right 

505.61 510.11 B: but we've also lived in indiana virginia texas i lived in mexico for a while 

510.25 519.40 B: so i a lot of lot of the stuff i did is um i moved because we were working with the missions organization so i do a lot of traveling within that and now um 

510.33 511.80 A: oh that's cool 

517.78 518.65 A: uh-huh 

519.50 527.13 B: and since then my h- my ex-husband well he was pursuing you know the corporate ladder and so we moved for better opportunities several times 

527.26 530.01 B: and now i'm back in chicago with my kids 

529.32 530.96 A: yeah well 

530.04 530.76 B: (( so )) 

530.80 532.44 B: starting over [laughter] 

531.06 541.17 A: my husband yeah [laughter] my husband grew up in military so he got to move around a lot but that kind of now he wants to stay stationed and i'm like 

541.18 546.99 A: oh but it would be so cool to go see this or that so [laughter] he's already gone and seen it so [laughter] 

545.50 549.11 B: (( [laughter] well he's probably burned out )) 

549.49 550.35 A: (( yeah so )) 

549.51 564.39 B: there's uh 'cause there are other times you know just like the friend thing for me i tend to make friends extra easier than my children because i'm more open and i'm just you know i'm just i want friends i'm gonna pursue friends and that's the way it is you know i i feel like if you show yourself friendly you will always have friends 

557.31 558.06 A: right 

564.34 565.16 A: right 

564.37 568.39 B: and um but now like my son he's very quiet 

568.71 574.60 B: so he has a harder time making friends and it seems like every time he finally gets a really good friend we move 

574.17 575.21 A: yeah 

574.77 581.34 B: and so i do see that we need to i mean he's thirteen now and i do think we really need to i need to settle down 

581.58 592.09 B: for the rest of their you know for the rest of their their years and let them have some stability because we are constantly moving and and then they you know they make friends and they lose their friends quickly 

591.78 599.95 A: yeah do you think that has anything to do with the media um talking a lot about stranger danger and things like that and
