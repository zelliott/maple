502.02 513.56 A: i did something today i've never done before i had some big ferns and i planted them in the ground usually i just plant 'em in big containers but i took 'em out of the containers and planted them in the ground i up on a kind of a porch awning in the shade

513.05 514.94 B: yeah they're definitely shade 

514.25 520.99 A: yeah they gotta have shade so i'm real gonna be really interested in how my ferns are gonna do planted in the ground instead of the big container this year

521.32 529.96 B: yeah ferns grow everywhere where i'm from like they grow as tall as me bigger than me they're like everywhere but that's oregon 

528.81 541.49 A: i've got one that i kept over through the winter at work and it was huge it took two people to pick it up and we potted it today so i'm anxious to see how it'll do i babied that thing all winter long and swept up under it and 'cause they shed so bad so i 

533.35 534.35 B: (( wow )) 

538.91 539.90 B: (( hm ))

547.09 555.07 B: yeah ferns are really nice 'cause they don't much work and they grow really well and they're really a nice touch in the garden 

555.17 564.46 A: that's one thing i really enjoy is is flowers and planting outside and just seeing everything grow and going out the next day and see what's happened and and 

562.86 565.11 B: mhm yeah

577.01 583.10 B: i mean i don't have a front yard at all it's just the uh [noise] like my stoop and then the sidewalk

584.20 585.51 B: it's a row home 

585.91 599.95 B: um on like on the east coast there's like houses that are like old brick houses usually um [lipsmack] and they're right up next to each other so there's not like a space between the next house like they're all smooshed together which is nice in the winter because
