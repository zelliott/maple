10.04 13.13 A: do you wanna start tell me what you like 

12.51 20.74 B: sure um i guess i'm more of an inside activities person and in that case it really doesn't matter whether it's winter or summer 

20.79 25.28 B: um i like to read i like to work on my computer 

25.36 30.54 B: but um i do also like to work in my garden we've really started working on it this year 

30.61 37.94 B: and obviously i like sort of this weather early spring weather best everything's growing and green outside 

38.47 50.34 A: yeah well [cough] i like the spring and the autumn best uh the winter's too cold for me [laughter] and the summer gets too hot and i don't wanna be out in the sun and the humidity 

44.17 45.78 B: yeah [laughter] 

49.74 51.05 B: yeah 

50.44 55.41 A: so i i but i do enjoy the spring because it brings a feeling of renewal 

55.13 56.47 B: yeah 

55.77 65.34 A: and uh i put i do both inside and out i try except when the weather's really bad to get out for a little while each day 

59.34 60.46 B: mhm 

64.66 66.18 B: yeah me too 

65.50 69.60 A: and i can't do anything very strenuous i'm seventy nine 

69.21 70.70 B: (( oh wow )) 

69.99 72.82 A: but uh i do a lot of walking 

72.35 73.41 B: mhm 

73.02 84.86 A: and um we have a rooftop pool i live in an apartment building so in the summer uh i go up i swim a little bit but we also have water exercises 

78.01 79.05 B: mhm 

84.57 85.98 B: (( [noise] cool )) 

85.05 93.77 A: and i enjoy that but walking is my main outdoor activity there's not much else i can do at this point mhm 

90.27 91.32 B: yeah 

92.86 100.70 B: yeah i love to walk too actually i i now live in ashville north carolina but i used to live in charleston south carolina 

100.54 101.62 A: uh-huh 

101.04 111.08 B: and during the summer it would get so hot just about the only thing you could do was walk get anything any more excited and you're gonna get overheated 

110.40 116.55 A: yeah yeah well i live in the city in philadelphia right in the center of the city 

116.10 117.50 B: oh wow 

116.84 128.77 A: but there's a beautiful park just about a five minute walk from where i live and sometimes i just walk around the park sometimes i bring a magazine or a book and i sit and read and rest for a while 

120.53 122.54 B: mhm mhm 

128.17 129.61 B: yeah 

129.13 136.52 A: so i enjoy that and living in the city has the advantage i can walk to many of my errands 

136.06 137.43 B: yeah 

136.63 140.52 A: so that gives me an opportunity to exercise a little bit 

140.10 154.29 B: i totally i used to live downtown and i could walk wherever i wanted to go and now i sort of live in the suburbs and it makes it i think actually i'm outside less because i don't get the chance to walk like i don't walk to work and i don't walk to run errands 

143.78 145.21 A: yeah 

154.31 160.08 B: so i'm sort of i don't know stuck inside either a house or a car all the time and 

159.45 160.82 A: yeah 

160.18 162.19 B: usually in the air conditioning 

162.19 168.44 A: yeah it's hard when you need a car to even get a newspaper or a loaf of bread or something [laughter] 

167.53 172.63 B: yeah actually um like i said i'm twenty two and i am just learning to drive 

172.44 173.40 A: (( uh )) 

172.91 176.80 B: yeah i just learned to drive actually um about two months ago 

176.99 182.73 B: and but i actually i have to say as far as an outside activity goes i really like it 

182.88 193.18 B: um it's really fun i feel totally liberated because i did i lived here for about two or three months without having my license so i couldn't really do anything outside 

192.93 194.20 A: oh yeah 

193.26 196.99 B: outside the house or just sort of stuck in our yard 

197.01 202.89 B: um [lipsmack] but now i can get around it's a lot more convenient i'm getting a job um 

197.15 198.04 A: (( well )) 

203.12 204.65 B: but anyway my thank 

204.02 207.25 A: it sounds like things are going fr- well for you 

206.95 208.12 B: (( you )) 

208.07 213.47 A: yeah you know i still drive because uh if i have to do marketing or 

213.18 214.51 B: right 

213.58 218.96 A: certain errands or visiting certain friends but i don't drive great distances anymore 

218.42 219.69 B: yeah 

219.05 232.18 A: and i tend to stay off many of the freeways and expressways here because they're you know they go way beyond the speed limit and they cut in and out and i'm not as brave as i used to be [laughter] 

227.65 229.82 B: yeah 

231.43 232.82 B: yeah 

232.19 243.51 A: but um my car really gives me assis- without it i'd have to have people take me to my errands or you know do things for me and i like to feel independent 

239.72 240.96 B: mhm 

242.93 245.42 B: yeah i know exactly how you feel 

244.01 244.94 A: yeah 

245.22 254.04 A: but i do a lot of reading too and uh i've had a computer now for about two years i was a little late getting on board 

246.91 247.98 B: mhm 

253.44 254.67 B: yeah 

254.09 259.67 A: and now i'm an addict i'm at it every day [laughter] you know with something or other 

255.78 257.34 B: oh yeah 

257.53 259.03 B: [laughter] 

259.19 261.43 B: (( checking your emails )) 

260.67 266.46 A: yeah oh and i have friends you know all over the united states and in europe and canada 

264.31 265.46 B: mhm 

266.06 267.41 B: me too 

266.51 272.77 A: and uh we uh corres- you know go back and forth as though they were right around the corner 

272.28 273.89 B: yeah 

273.16 278.50 A: and uh i i love the internet i find new things all the time 

278.06 279.14 B: mhm 

278.68 282.18 A: and it's a way to keep learning and growing for me 

281.80 289.97 B: yeah yeah i think it's a really good tool and i think it's really fun i have a great time i visit a lot of sites like um 

290.24 294.27 B: you know comedy sites and joke of the day type things and 

293.68 295.18 A: oh yeah 

294.60 303.89 B: um 'cause i haven't had a job lately i've sort of been bored and the most entertaining thing in the house i would have to say is the computer and i do spend a lot of time on the computer 

303.49 306.92 A: yeah i've got you know it's like a drug though you [laughter] you 

306.82 308.54 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

306.82 318.67 A: know it's the you get almost addicted to it it's hard for me to drag myself away sometimes but i do set a time limit i tell myself at such and such a time i'm shutting it down 

312.85 314.13 B: mhm 

315.87 317.67 B: [laughter] 

318.14 319.55 B: yeah 

318.99 327.64 A: and uh but it's it's fun you know i have grandchildren and they send me emails all the time about little things that they're doing 

322.74 323.82 B: mhm 

325.20 326.64 B: yeah 

327.40 328.92 B: that's cool 

327.68 337.14 A: because uh they're not always home for me to call them and i'm not always here we miss each other on the phone but this way we have our emails and 

332.43 333.43 B: mhm 

336.34 337.51 B: yeah 

337.65 345.03 B: yeah my dad works a lot so i can pretty much always contact him by email 'cause he has to check his email for work 

344.71 345.91 A: oh yeah 

345.31 347.56 B: so i know he's always looking at that 

347.26 348.85 A: mhm 

348.23 354.02 B: but um yeah i would say as far as limiting myself the only think i really have to limit is reading 

348.94 349.91 A: yeah 

354.09 358.95 B: um i read a lot uh i love to read um 

358.97 361.87 B: i'll read all day if i can [laughter] 

360.88 363.75 A: [laughter] yeah what sort of things do you like to read 

363.18 373.85 B: um just about every type of novel i even like a lot of non fiction i'm reading a really good book right now called the alienist by caleb carr 

373.57 379.02 A: oh someone told me about it someone recommended it uh i'll have to look for it 

376.83 377.64 B: it's

383.47 384.87 A: yeah 

384.26 391.59 B: a- but it's really good and it has um sort of a fictionalized account of theodore roosevelt in it which is really cool 

391.14 392.50 A: mhm 

391.89 399.49 B: and the he's an excellent writer the book is fairly long but it's very good very sort of engaging
