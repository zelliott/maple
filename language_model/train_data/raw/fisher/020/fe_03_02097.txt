11.86 21.28 B: [laughter] i didn't hear the beginning of the message because something else was going on but i did hear say introduce yourself to the other participant [laughter] 

20.23 31.31 A: was this to talk about friendship friends and whether they're we have friends that are numerous or whether we have few few close friends [laughter] how about you [laughter] 

30.64 33.36 B: oh oh well 

33.27 47.99 B: i have some of both but i call um like the numerous number of friends i call them acquaintances but i have really good acquaintances too so you know but i have i have several really good friends that i've had like all my whole lifetime 

48.03 55.36 B: and i'm in my fifties so [laughter] it's been a long time that i've had 'em as friends what about you 

55.21 62.09 A: same here i'm in my sixties i'm a little senior here uh yes i have friends i've had all my life but it seems like 

62.15 63.66 A: the friends that i 

64.07 67.08 A: (( friendships that i have developed uh )) 

67.33 70.52 A: that we ha- really have become like a kindred spirit 

70.79 77.78 A: they're always there i mean they are my friends forever and like you i have acquaintances but quality acquaintances i'm not really 

70.83 71.62 B: yeah 

77.76 88.46 A: a social person that collects people [laughter] uh i think i'm too busy to do to do that but um the friends that i have we have a lot in common and i'm comfortable with them and i can trust them 

80.76 81.71 B: right 

88.45 100.75 A: with everything or anything and they're just always there and i know they're always there if i need them and it we can go for weeks or months and not talk to each other like i have lived in nine states before 

100.66 105.23 A: and in my living in that many states i kept friends like christmas cards or whatever 

105.20 118.62 A: but just to give you an example last week a friend i haven't seen in twenty years and maybe talked to during that time three or four times we sent christmas cards [laughter] and that's about it and maybe we'll say we have another grandbaby or whatever 

118.63 120.57 A: they just called and said 

120.65 126.25 A: we're going to be in your area we're taking a cross country trip we'd like to stop in and see you [laughter] 

125.57 126.82 B: oh wow 

126.27 129.00 A: we are so excited [laughter] 

127.68 130.70 B: oh yes yeah isn't it neat 

130.13 136.65 A: and it sound like we're just picking up where we left off [laughter] and it's been the kids were babies then and now they have their own babies [laughter] you know 

132.47 133.26 B: yeah 

135.69 149.74 B: [laughter] oh well you know i think that is a sign though of a true friendship you know i mean of where you just have an enduring friendship where you feel as if you have just you can pick up wherever you left off no matter how many years it's been 

137.62 138.86 A: so it is 

149.43 153.42 A: (( that's true that's really true and you have it seems like there's some friends that )) 

153.48 158.23 A: they can be busy or involved or whatever but you know that if there is a need 

158.34 170.28 A: they will call you will just rise to that occasion or if you have a need they'll rise to that occasion maybe you haven't heard from 'em or have been too busy to [sigh] plan anything and you'll just call 'em and say you know i just had you on my mind or whatever 

160.89 161.88 B: mhm 

170.38 184.32 A: and it doesn't matter it's just the sweetest kind of thing and i think i like also that i can be vulnerable to my friends i mean they can come over and catch me not at my best or my house not the cleanest i run a day care so there's usu- [laughter] there's a lot 

177.99 178.87 B: right 

182.34 186.04 B: oh wow oh wow you must have some energy [laughter] 

184.79 190.96 A: yeah i tell you there's a lot of stuff around and they they can come in i'd love to have it kinda 

191.05 200.83 A: guest related but they can come in and move things aside and take the toys and everything and sit down and they can go to the kitchen and the dishes may be still in the sink and they'll just just have some coffee you know 

194.76 195.57 B: yeah 

200.90 202.56 A: and i think 

200.94 201.94 B: (( yeah )) 

202.83 216.65 A: those kind of things they build and you can cry with them if there's something sad and you can laugh if there's something [laughter] happy and and you can care about them you pray for each other because we're christians and we really always do that and and that kind of cements things and 

213.38 214.50 B: mhm 

216.01 217.06 B: it does 

216.91 229.28 A: so we feel like that you someone i read somewhere that friends are like fl- flowers you gather for a bouquet and it it's really true each one of 'em has their own beauty and their own function and there's no competition or any real threat but 

229.25 234.59 A: you know you're never you know you're never alone or isolated they're there out there so [laughter] 

233.48 234.06 B: (( it )) 

233.98 243.44 B: does [laughter] well i have um it's kind of odd um i still think i'm more comfortable with friends closer to my own age in general you know 

243.24 252.45 B: however i have such a diversified group of friends and if they do meet each other they you would think that since i like them 

252.32 260.89 B: they'd all like each other but i find quite often that they don't necessarily um and then i have a friend who has recently 

261.03 265.19 B: just really we hit if off but she's only twenty three years old 

264.88 266.10 A: (( oh that's great )) 

265.31 271.53 B: and i'm actually old enough to be her grandma you know uh [laughter] well her mom was really young but uh 

270.38 271.87 A: [laughter] and she doesn't see it 

271.85 272.87 B: pardon me 

272.58 273.98 A: she doesn't see it 

273.81 277.11 B: yeah well she does with me one on one 

277.34 282.43 B: but then one of my other friends was over who is in her seventies 

282.54 292.19 B: and she was my friend who is in her seventies was sitting at the table um my kitchen table i didn't realize they were both going to come over but i just had surgery friday 

292.23 293.36 B: (( and )) 

293.56 300.04 B: the other friend is very she just kind of takes care of herself she doesn't expect me to wait on her 

300.12 312.65 B: and so she went to the refrigerator got something to drink and and the the older friend just about fell off the chair you know she was just appalled [laughter] and i kinda liked it because i don't have to 

301.82 303.05 A: [laughter] 

308.67 310.11 A: [laughter] 

312.61 313.66 A: yeah 

312.67 316.81 B: to attend to her all the time you know she just makes herself comfortable 

316.27 327.43 A: there's a compliment in there for you it says that you make me feel so comfortable that i know that i i can take liberties and and and it's okay and that's like saying your home must make her feel 

327.38 334.56 A: at home and there there's homes you go into that you don't feel that so i think there's a compliment when someone uh decides that they can 

330.73 331.58 B: true 

334.59 342.47 A: save you uh the steps or whatever and say if you don't mind i'll just go to the refrigerator and pour myself a a glass of juice or something i think that's a wonderful compliment 

342.09 343.73 B: yes yes 

343.09 351.70 A: i do too and i have friends likewise that are young and old but then i have have remarried after many many years of divorce and my husband's a lot younger than i am 

351.74 361.32 A: and so we we flow in two different groups we find that we're that we're like magnetized by the young people that he finds interesting and a lot of energy with and 

360.69 361.65 B: uh-huh 

361.39 375.91 A: and uh and then he feels very comfortable in the grandma grandpa set [laughter] he's sort of adopted my children and their children and he he feels like he's a grandpa and sometimes i think he acts more like one than i do [laughter] 

364.95 366.92 B: [laughter] 

369.46 370.45 B: (( wow )) 

374.50 377.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

375.87 380.47 A: that's what happens you live with somebody for a few years [laughter] you know 

378.36 384.88 B: [laughter] i got remarried after after ten years of being divorced you 

384.99 391.46 B: know but i married a guy that was a year older than me uh but he had trouble adjusting to the grandpa 

391.52 396.38 B: situation whereas i because i was a grandma and he wasn't you know at that point 

391.76 392.58 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

396.15 399.93 A: but that that passes so quickly 'cause you know children have a way 

399.89 405.67 A: of getting into your hearts and they make friends for you too i mean my grandkids will 

404.23 405.39 B: mhm 

405.54 416.17 A: they make friends for us because they have their little girlfriends and we actually have met two neighbors that we hadn't had a chance to get to know because the little kids found each other and so we found out well we have to get to know them 

414.12 414.99 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

416.30 423.82 A: we thought wow they're so cool we've got to have them over for dinner one night [laughter] and we didn't even we'd just seen them in passing we didn't realize you know so sometimes we could 

423.88 431.73 A: you can see the friends or about to be friends and that's the really important part too [noise] is you're always open to increase the numbers if that's 

426.75 427.76 B: (( uh-huh )) 

431.74 435.47 A: you know if that's what's meant to be and and it goes on 

434.13 435.25 B: i think so 

435.34 445.75 B: i think when you're a christian too your heart is open to all kinds of relationships and accepting people as they are not as you you know expect them to be 

442.01 444.22 A: yes oh yes oh yes 

444.41 447.53 A: [noise] and you have an in- instant common denominator 

446.96 447.81 B: right 

447.48 452.36 A: because you have faith and that that instant faith that instant common denominator puts you in 

452.27 462.62 A: the same value system and and that's what so cool 'cause you can uh you already have w- it saves working through a lot of stuff [laughter] but we have friends that aren't christian that 

453.77 454.63 B: true 

459.91 461.47 B: (( [laughter] great )) 

462.73 469.90 A: that um we believe will be and they're drawn to us and that we think that's really good too 

467.81 468.95 B: (( ah )) 

469.36 471.68 B: yeah yeah 

471.40 480.97 A: and we teach in a we teach school in a church school and and uh we're finding that these little children uh that we teach are fifth and sixth graders they kinda look to us as 

475.25 475.98 B: (( mm )) 

481.11 486.83 A: one one of the little girls wrote us an email and she said [sigh] you are my very best friend 

486.24 487.87 B: oh 

487.21 491.70 A: and i you never ever think about a ten year old thinking that i'm their best friend and 

491.03 492.44 B: oh 

491.79 496.56 A: we just thought that was so special we said well we know we're meant to be in her life [laughter] you know 

495.64 500.00 B: yes [laughter] oh my that is special 

497.09 498.13 A: so that is 

498.32 507.09 A: that's real special but you know you talk about getting married again you know i i married my friend i and we hear that statement and i never thought yeah the first time i was married i was a kid 

507.15 512.10 A: and the second time we were just buddies and friends for a year and a half and it it is true 

512.05 512.96 B: yeah 

512.16 519.03 A: the friendship being there first makes the marriage so inevitable it it yeah makes it so beautiful 

516.92 518.04 B: yeah 

518.69 526.14 B: yes yeah 'cause the friendship is enduring you know and some of the more superficial things usually are not 

524.15 525.19 A: (( that's true )) 

525.80 530.12 A: that's true you you're you're absolutely right and there's times of a 

526.22 528.06 B: so that's true 

530.18 533.00 A: special occasions and stuff they're wonderful 

530.49 531.78 B: oh oh 

532.65 534.98 B: [laughter] oh what do we do now

536.31 538.36 B: uh i didn't hear anything
