96.96 103.75 A: but yeah i mean obviously the activities are are dependent on the weather as well i mean yeah so 

101.80 103.09 B: oh definitely 

103.54 113.04 A: you don't know ah i mean it depends on what you like to do outside i mean [noise] some things require cold weather and some require warm so

157.96 159.80 B: that's right [laughter] 

159.03 165.81 A: so you know and i guess you know it depends on what you're wearing i mean people could say it's cold but i mean you can always dress warmer or dress lighter

275.60 277.66 B: yeah that's r- it's awesome 

277.71 279.46 A: see a lot of fish and all that 

278.91 282.05 B: oh yeah [mn] we we're with we went to 

282.47 288.69 B: bermuda and that was the first time i had snorkeled that was a few years ago and it's funny because we took this 

283.71 284.62 A: mhm 

287.07 287.86 A: yeah 

288.59 291.03 B: group run you know snorkel trip 

290.90 294.26 B: (( and you know you go out in a boat and y- everybody jumps in )) 

294.13 301.89 B: but there's like fifty people you know and none of them have ever done it and you're getting smacked in the head [laughter] with flippers and all this stuff and 

299.25 300.43 A: [laughter] 

301.46 302.34 A: yeah 

301.90 309.34 B: so we're like i can't believe we you know pay all this money to go on this trip and [laughter] and you just you know spent the whole time defending yourself against other people 

309.14 310.39 A: [laughter] 

309.55 321.63 B: and so um then we find this place that's called snorkel park and it looks you know it's all run down it looks totally tacky and [laughter] the beach looked really bad but it's you know like here's your five dollars for your snorkel and fin and everything 

316.20 317.23 A: mhm 

321.69 327.61 B: and so you have to like wade in through all these really bad rocks but then you swim through this little little channel 

327.48 328.34 A: (( ahah )) 

327.54 338.25 B: and it was absolutely amazing we spent hours out there [mn] like fish were just huge and it was it was the best trip ever [laughter] yeah and [sigh] we thought oh yeah 

334.97 335.93 A: oh yeah 

337.14 342.65 A: yeah i've been snor- i've been snorkeling a few times ah it's it's great because it's not as like 

342.68 354.87 A: involved as scuba diving would be but it's just kind of and it doesn't require much effort you know so it- it's it's and just just the amount of things you see just i mean you just look all around you and you see all s- all s- all sorts of things 

344.08 344.89 B: no 

346.90 347.69 B: no 

354.31 355.89 B: oh yeah it's really cool 

355.20 357.05 A: yeah it's great

361.57 362.64 A: excuse me 

364.77 365.76 A: yeah 

365.15 367.06 B: but that's i don't know that's 

366.18 369.41 A: it it takes a lot of training like you need to get a certified 

367.44 372.18 B: it really does and i'm not like the best swimmer i prefer just to you know [laughter] 

372.21 373.42 A: (( stay on the surface )) 

372.82 384.29 B: yeah and i like i like when you can like walk into the ocean and snorkel instead of just jumping you know off the end of a boat in the middle of nowhere [laughter] i like [laughter] i like to just take it easy 

373.63 374.65 A: yeah 

376.95 378.02 A: mhm 

380.91 382.36 A: yeah [laughter]
