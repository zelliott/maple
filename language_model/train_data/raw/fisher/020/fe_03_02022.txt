54.51 56.67 A: i don't know that much about it [laughter] 

56.01 59.27 B: you know i was thinking that too something about the corporate 

59.38 68.15 B: ah [mn] something about corporate scandals how has that affected you i guess how i guess it's like a trickle down type of thing maybe how is the economy i don't know 

66.16 67.13 A: (( yeah )) 

68.14 71.69 A: i don't know i mean as far as it goes with me 

71.27 72.02 B: (( ahah )) 

71.93 74.26 A: i don't see any difference in my area 

74.31 75.31 B: right 

74.50 79.08 A: as far as other than people just don't trust the companies like they did 

78.87 80.75 B: oh absolutely not 

80.24 87.95 A: you know that way but as far as overall we are not well i'm not even anywhere near close to where that enron thing is 

87.59 89.20 B: yeah yeah 

88.25 95.69 A: or any of those i mean they were all the big ones that really goofed up and so far the ones around here haven't been caught yet 

95.18 99.66 B: [mn] that's the thing yeah see there's the the trust factor it's [laughter] 

95.71 96.91 A: [laughter] 

99.67 108.51 B: it's really hard to say um you know what i know what companies are are doing you know like the insci- [mn] like the inside scoop on things [laughter] [mn] 

101.60 102.85 A: it is funny 

108.56 115.01 A: yeah well that's i mean the companies that i even associate with i would never hear about it till 

114.32 115.78 B: (( ah yeah )) 

115.51 120.92 A: it was done because i work part time for the school system around here 

120.44 121.57 B: mhm 

120.96 123.58 A: so we are not affected by 

123.94 125.05 A: that 

125.15 126.38 B: [mn] right 

125.45 129.78 A: and so we don't hear about it till it hits the national news then we go oh no 

129.83 141.68 B: probably i don't think the average person probably is directly affected maybe i don't know maybe some people are indirectly ah affected maybe they realise or maybe they don't it could be small things 

141.35 148.62 A: yeah well another i mean it the even the small person in those bigger companies basically just lost their job 

148.63 150.19 B: yeah yeah 

149.63 154.28 A: except for where they had invested everything they had in the company 

153.55 156.22 B: oh i know that's that's just just awful 

154.93 157.02 A: that was sad but 

156.47 160.24 B: oh horrible yeah those people definitely should be prosecuted and made to be 

159.78 161.50 A: oh i think so 

160.06 174.30 B: paid back yeah they should be put away for a long time absolutely i mean that that's that's horrendo- that that's such greed you know [mn] and there's such greed that takes over you know like it's never enough for those people i mean they have more money than [laughter] than they absolutely n- need you know 

168.90 169.86 A: yeah 

174.06 175.46 B: much more [noise] 

174.26 182.47 A: well that's what [mn] when there was a movie about enron and that's the only one i can think of right now that's been recent that was a big major 

182.48 186.41 A: corporate oh my goodness they did what [laughter] 

186.23 187.36 B: mhm 

186.58 191.88 A: but the movie portrayed 'em as the company just they wanted to party all the time 

191.76 192.76 B: yeah 

192.45 198.05 A: they were just in the they wanted money they were never happy with enough money they had to have 

196.77 198.13 B: [mn] there you go 

198.16 199.12 B: mhm 

198.29 202.14 A: more money and money's the root of all evil i don't care 

202.69 205.57 A: greed and money i think go hand in hand 

204.95 218.87 B: yes i really do yeah yeah i think this is just ah you know just my opinion i guess i think certain people have [mn] i could be wrong certain people have ah personalities that may be are they are predisposed to behave that way 

205.66 207.60 A: all the way around 

218.92 225.19 A: yeah i think well god has a sense of humour [laughter] i just haven't figured it out yet [laughter] 

222.94 224.21 B: yeah 

224.74 226.07 B: yeah 

225.37 226.31 A: [mn] 

226.39 236.23 A: i mean after all just look around this world there's enough things to just laugh at that animals or nature or something so he's got a sense of humor somewhere [noise] 

231.04 232.22 B: i know 

232.70 234.22 B: yeah i know 

235.14 238.23 B: i know you really have to or else you'll you know [laughter] 

238.24 239.08 B: (( you know )) 

238.33 244.58 A: but i mean the government should've never let it go that long [noise] till they could ruin so many people 

244.76 246.44 B: oh i know gosh 

245.67 247.73 A: because they had to have had [noise] an 

248.02 251.32 A: inkling between tax returns and just 

252.07 257.15 A: insider anything somebody somewhere had to know [noise] 

256.43 261.74 B: [mn] that's the thing y- you wonder who knew and you know why were they hiding it or 

261.76 263.71 B: you know there's so many so much thing- 

262.29 265.60 A: yeah were were they being paid off somewhere 

264.83 271.26 B: [mn] yeah there's so many things that the the public will just never know probably you know with a lot of those things 

269.28 270.14 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

270.91 274.82 A: well they do that and then well down where we're at bell south 

275.46 276.49 B: what's the name 

275.57 278.37 A: which is the telephone company bell south 

277.62 279.44 B: oh bell south yeah right ahah 

279.12 286.86 A: yeah and they were a well mabelle was a huge thing that the government stepped in and said no 

287.09 294.11 A: but the thing is it's still the same company they just divided it up and gave that four presidents with one owner 

289.57 290.70 B: i know 

291.00 292.14 B: yes 

294.09 298.99 B: and you wonder what the purposes of that i i d- [laughter] i don't know i just don't get 

294.23 295.34 A: type of thing 

297.66 301.75 A: i never understood it it's kind of like well even microsoft 

300.03 301.10 B: yeah 

301.65 302.78 B: i know 

302.48 311.67 A: he's done a lot of illegal things apparently but i don't see any i know he don't they the company donated computers to our school

319.28 320.35 B: yeah 

320.86 327.36 B: yeah see that's what i'm saying it's the small maybe on a smaller scale for the average person and these things probably do take a while 

327.20 330.46 A: yeah 'cause [noise] i mean we would've bought a computer anyway 

330.72 331.67 B: mhm 

331.01 339.04 A: and he had the i mean i in a lot of ways i think they were wrong in keeping him from charging what he wanted to for his stuff

340.20 341.80 B: (( i think like they call that )) 

340.40 344.20 A: but at the same time he had that monopoly on it 

344.05 345.40 B: mhm 

344.97 350.05 A: and it just i don't know i [mn] do not understand this stu- [laughter]

424.77 426.12 B: yes he does 

429.32 441.82 A: talk over your head and leaves you in the dark and he brings something that to me would seem very complicated and makes it understandable even that my kids would understand 

433.58 434.74 B: oh i know 

441.02 443.88 B: [mn] that's true yeah he really does 

442.63 447.14 A: he seems to be able to do that and he likes to take things 

447.21 457.52 A: like our what our topic's supposed to be tonight [laughter] and break 'em up and say now this is what they are doing and do you think they should do this and then he lets people respond with 

449.71 450.95 B: mhm

533.77 534.91 A: oh man 

536.18 549.03 B: i guess a topic that maybe people just know on the the fringes about it but unless you are really in the in the world of business i guess or it really affects you you really wouldn't be an expert on the subject the average person yeah r- seriously 

546.97 547.87 A: yeah 

549.15 550.35 B: that's the way i look it 

549.31 555.69 A: well it's not something that [mn] it affects me somehow some way down the line but 

553.22 554.17 B: (( right ))
