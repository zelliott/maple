1.54 4.04 A: um my name is liz [noise] [noise] 

4.00 5.25 B: hi liz 

5.63 7.08 B: (( [noise] um )) 

7.98 21.27 B: i actually i like outdoor activities better um especially when it's warm because um i'm a person i like i like the weather and i like i like being outside i'm very active 

21.02 21.95 A: mhm 

22.16 23.08 B: um 

23.67 28.56 B: so i i'm very much into um [noise] walking and biking 

29.28 36.56 B: and pretty much moving around so um especially it being warm right now um i like to be outside 

37.03 38.51 B: (( rather than being inside )) 

37.08 38.12 A: [noise] makes sense 

38.12 47.61 A: yeah i'm i'm kind i'm kind of ambig- it's it's kind of two minds um i'm really am [noise] essentially a very lazy person 

39.48 40.49 B: how 'bout you 

47.60 49.16 A: so [laughter] 

49.05 53.50 A: so for me to go out and do [noise] the running or the walking or anything is is 

49.16 49.81 B: (( mm )) 

53.51 66.87 A: not so much i do enjoy doing things like cross country skiing in the cold weather but i enjoy getting out and gardening and pottering around my lawn in the warm weather i just feel more outdoorsy i think in the warm weather too 

58.20 59.15 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

67.91 71.30 B: yeah i think that that makes a huge difference because you really 

72.04 75.80 B: you really don't want to be running around outside too much when it's cold 

77.31 78.65 A: exactly 

77.63 78.53 B: [noise] but 

78.64 89.87 B: i mean [mn] with my with my job i mean i'm i'm very very active you know i'm on my feet running around so i think that has a lot to do with wanting to get outside too because you are inside all day you know 

89.71 90.93 A: (( [noise] right )) 

91.27 95.08 B: so i mean i i think that has a lot to do with it too 

95.17 97.35 B: (( um how 'bout you um )) 

97.53 101.73 B: does your work involve you running around doing a lot of um 

102.45 104.33 B: you know activity like 

105.28 106.77 B: walking and running 

105.28 106.32 A: actually 

106.48 112.44 A: my job is extraordinarily sedentary i work um at a call centre and i work third shift 

112.34 118.31 A: so all i do is sit and and take calls and do customer service all night long so 

112.58 113.63 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

118.21 130.71 A: um i think that for me too is that i i spend [mn] much of the day sleeping and so i'm only really awake from about four o'clock on and i think that really has a you know a difference as far as what you do as 

130.58 140.26 A: you know i i really should get out and and do more active ah you know just to to actually do something but i don't know [laughter] 

139.84 140.84 B: [laughter] 

141.66 156.39 B: um but like on your days off do you do you find that you are running around trying to catch up with ah a lot of stuff that you are not able to do during the week like you feel like you had to do laundry and and grocery shopping and all that you have to do all in one shop pretty much [noise] [noise] [noise] 

156.02 162.20 A: i do yes i have ah basically half a friday and all of saturday that i do everything so my 

162.25 167.88 A: my fridays are usually the ah the shopping and laundry days and and saturday i spend trying to 

167.69 180.43 A: keep up with either the snow shoveling out you know or or my gardening or whatever and it's kind of nice the kids enjoy being around the dirt so we are actually losing a lot of lawn and gaining a lot of garden lately [laughter] 

179.93 182.26 B: that's good [noise] 

181.00 183.53 A: they just dig for me [laughter] 

182.82 187.15 B: your your kids are really ah a big push to get you out 

187.14 200.39 A: they are they are i think honestly had i you know my own way i'm like i said pretty sedentary i'd probably sit around and and read all day but the kids enjoy being out so we we try and do as much as we can outside 

200.28 204.54 B: that's that's one indoor activity that i enjoy very much too is reading 

204.45 217.71 B: i feel like every day i have to i have to read something like the paper or a magazine or or something that you know [mn] 'cause you gotta keep your your mind going too i mean i really agree with you on that 

217.77 219.12 A: exactly 

219.29 221.27 A: exactly i feel 

219.67 221.30 B: what what kind of books

295.04 297.05 B: have you ever heard of hummel figurines 

296.43 303.01 A: i have yes we lived in ah in germany for quite a while and they were every damn place you turned [laughter] 

301.50 308.97 B: [laughter] well that's that's kind of like my thing now but you have to save up for them because they are so expensive 

309.01 314.67 B: so it takes it takes a while to really get the money together and then see one you really like 

314.43 315.62 A: yeah 

316.36 320.38 B: but where i'm at um [noise] there's a store where you can you can 

320.69 328.42 B: put money down on so that that kind of works out good so that's kind of like my that's my hobby right now my my big hobby 

323.96 325.10 A: (( oh that's nice )) 

328.07 329.04 A: mhm 

329.47 330.47 B: (( so i'm )) 

330.66 332.71 B: (( going to see how it does from there )) 

333.26 344.31 A: that's interesting what i do um what i did for quite a while before i um took this most recent job is i um bought and resold antique glass so that actually is my passion 

344.20 345.63 B: wow 

344.33 345.55 A: and ah 

345.44 351.86 A: so [mn] [noise] looking around my office now and i actually um i collected for a long time the carnival glass and 

351.68 366.62 A: that was all of my activities i went ah to auctions and and flea markets and and wandered around but now what i'm doing is the smaller tumblers and i just have tons and tons of these i'm looking around and just kind of glowing with pride i love my my 

366.55 368.24 A: my collection of tumblers 

368.26 378.88 B: sounds interesting because [noise] i mean [noise] i think it's really beautiful and you don't see it very often all because it's so rare is that ah is the depression glass 

376.30 377.31 A: mhm 

379.46 381.30 A: yes yes 

382.05 386.94 B: and um i don't know i know there is a particular gla- brand that's like really 

387.33 391.56 B: i can't think of it off the top of my head but [noise] um 

391.76 393.07 B: (( it's really )) 

394.00 399.05 B: there's a certain type of depression glass that's really ah [noise] really popular 

399.70 411.55 A: [noise] well the colored glass right now is incredibly popular and there and there's you know so many different kinds they have the clear and they have the pressed and and then you have the etched and it's it's actually a very that's 

412.07 418.61 A: so what i did for so long and i just have i have stacks [noise] and stacks of [noise] books about all the different kinds i just enjoyed it so much 

418.60 419.81 B: wow 

419.21 422.16 A: it's ah very indepth [laughter] 

422.24 428.00 A: which goes along with my reading thing i i'd snuggle up in bed with a good glass book [laughter] 

428.38 431.71 B: wow that's that's really fascinating 

432.55 435.97 B: (( there's a little there's a little [noise] shop not too far from um )) 

436.21 437.71 B: where i used to live [noise] 

438.24 439.33 B: that um 

439.74 444.33 B: that that's all they do is they they they blow and make their own glass [noise] 

443.75 445.46 A: oh how fun [noise] 

444.52 456.03 B: and and i have been there a couple of times and it's just like i mean they have a little area in the in the back where they do it and they can't take you back there but i mean they have pictures and you can 

448.32 448.90 A: (( [noise] )) 

456.22 457.59 B: you can um 

458.19 460.55 B: like put in orders 

461.14 464.66 B: you know if there's something specific that you want that you don't see 

462.60 463.88 A: sure 

464.85 470.05 B: it's just it's just really really neat they take you through the process of of glassblowing 

470.68 473.20 B: and it's just it's just really beautiful 

471.05 476.69 A: i i think that's just amazing that they can manipulate the the glass like that 

475.94 480.67 B: i know it's it's just incredible that it turns out 

480.98 482.86 B: the way that it does [mn] 

486.53 491.69 B: so i i mean [noise] it it seems like when you think about it though you know really 

486.61 487.31 A: i 

492.13 497.73 B: even with you know your indoor activities i mean it's really pretty multifaceted really 

494.24 494.90 A: (( [noise] )) 

497.77 511.26 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] i think they really are i just i'd love to have you know more time to to pursue what i you know ah truly enjoy which is definitely not answering calls at this call centre [laughter] that i work 

510.26 512.19 B: [noise] [noise] oh yeah [noise] 

511.63 513.27 A: at but there's i mean 

513.70 523.11 A: yeah i think that just as as far as myself i try and try and balance them out you know when [noise] doing the glass i spent a lot of time researching but then ah 

523.27 529.55 A: we were near quite a few huge flea markets and i would and the kids and i would go and 

529.32 541.26 A: and take a picnic basket and and walk around these stalls [noise] and and ah you know then go to the you know go to the the side park and have a picnic and there was ah you know there's a park for them to play on and we would do that also 

541.34 543.40 A: so i think that you can actually 

543.50 549.51 A: do both if you have to tie this into indoor and outdoor activities [laughter] [noise] 

548.91 552.93 B: oh yeah well with having kids i mean 

552.95 554.47 B: you really have to 

554.80 560.99 B: [mn] to keep a balance because what what they want to go and do and what you want to do could be two entirely different things 

560.38 561.54 A: oh yes 

561.16 562.06 B: you know 

562.44 565.47 B: so i mean i i g- i give you a lot of credit there 

566.54 570.00 B: um i don't i don't have any kids right now so 

567.64 568.40 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

570.67 571.75 B: (( so um )) 

571.85 573.48 B: (( i don't know i pretty much )) 

574.13 578.39 B: if i'm not too tired i try to i try to get out as much as i can 

580.09 592.56 A: [noise] and that's difficult too sometimes like you know i i know that for health reasons you should be out in the sun and it and it helps you sleep better it makes you a healthier person but ah you know it's it's hard to balance just the whole 

583.34 584.27 B: sure 

592.49 597.42 A: um you know just what you want to do and what you should be doing too 

597.24 598.81 B: yeah well 

599.30 599.90 B: (( there's ))
