0.56 2.28 A: hi my name is john 

2.00 4.15 B: hi john my name is bree

4.58 5.63 B: yeah 

5.05 6.19 A: how you doing bree 

5.65 7.99 B: good where where are you from john 

7.54 10.27 A: i'm from uh pittman new jersey 

9.91 11.94 B: oh okay i'm in chicago 

11.74 15.78 A: chicago i talked to somebody in arizona a little while ago 

12.53 13.58 B: yes 

15.56 16.51 B: really 

16.09 18.68 A: yeah this is pretty interesting 

18.17 23.55 B: yeah this is only the second one i've done but this topic is really deep 

23.53 25.07 A: yeah 

24.45 25.39 B: um 

26.24 35.17 B: i don't even know where to start with it because luckily it hasn't affected me too much any of these corporate scandals has not affected me directly 

31.08 32.30 A: well it 

34.94 42.87 A: i don't think it's affected me directly either but i think it affects every one of us if we have a 401k or a stock option in our company 

42.63 46.13 B: yeah see i don't have either one of those because i'm self-employed but 

45.68 46.75 A: i have both 

46.61 48.68 B: okay so it does affect you 

48.03 49.85 A: mhm 

49.33 49.89 B: (( [cough] )) 

50.55 54.12 A: and as far as i'm concerned what the government can do 

54.31 58.70 A: with the enron people and everything else like that you just lock them up and throw away the key 

59.46 69.14 A: i mean how do you take money out of people's retirement and and just [mn] just shrug it off like it's a like it's a mosquito 

69.16 81.28 B: yeah see i don't know how much the government can change people's moral um morality do you know what i mean people's ethics that's the word i'm looking for because unfortunately greed is such a 

76.69 77.50 A: right 

81.57 86.11 B: you know driving force in the world that i don't know what 

84.13 85.29 A: right 

86.27 89.13 B: if anything the government can do to 

89.54 91.68 B: you know to try to um 

91.91 93.53 B: curtail this 

93.13 100.38 A: well i i think our government is involved a little bit if you look at our big leaders they have questions among themselves 

101.22 103.19 A: and if you look at bush and chaney 

102.96 106.13 B: you mean questionable dealings themselves or 

105.02 106.46 A: yes yes 

106.23 110.70 B: yeah i mean because big business has got to be big for a reason i mean 

110.22 111.33 A: right 

110.71 120.32 B: you know i mean i'm sure there is some legitimate businesses out there that grew on their own and just on their own but unfortunately i think a lot of them 

120.45 127.23 B: traded favors and um did a lot of different things to um 

127.52 129.33 B: get where they are today 

130.75 135.59 A: but i i i think when they trade favors it only affects the little guys like us 

135.42 141.48 B: right exactly i mean and even though this like enron or any of those big places has not 

141.56 152.16 B: affected me directly it's affected the way that i look at i mean i'm self-employed one of the reasons i'm self-employed is because i don't trust any big businesses i don't 

151.43 152.85 A: mhm 

152.19 162.43 B: i don't trust working for a company for thirty years and putting all my heart and sole into it to either lose my job or lose my retirement 

163.68 166.56 B: you know so i guess it has affected me and 

166.70 167.65 B: um 

168.19 170.90 B: you know one thing i'll say which sounds a little bit 

171.22 177.09 B: cruel but something like this happening has at least kind of proven my point 

178.70 180.31 A: yeah yeah 

179.35 188.30 B: you know i mean like someone like my dad who's a lot older he doesn't understand like why i don't have like a typical nine to five job why i don't go to work and 

187.51 188.76 A: right 

188.20 198.89 B: you know and i've tried to explain to him and when scandals like this come out then i think maybe people in his age bracket think wow things aren't the same as when we were 

198.90 200.01 B: working 

199.66 209.47 A: oh absolutely and i just talked to the lady before you and that's exactly almost the same thing that's come up way back when you didn't hear about stuff like this 

209.38 210.42 B: right 

209.82 216.51 A: it's only it was kept hush hush or it wasn't released to the public or maybe the media wasn't as as 

216.67 219.47 A: story hounded as they are today 

219.68 225.09 A: and you know i i guess it's just the modern world that we live in today i don't know 

225.86 228.64 A: (( and i mean i'm just i'm just unsure )) 

228.97 234.76 A: of if this stuff has been happening since roosevelt and everybody else as president you know 

229.09 229.75 B: (( [mn] )) 

235.06 237.90 A: how how did they how did they deal with it 

238.01 244.15 B: i don't know and like you said was it happening and it just wasn't spoken about or was it not happening 

241.68 242.76 A: mhm 

244.00 245.50 A: yeah that's true too 

245.19 248.49 B: you know because maybe it was just a different time where 

248.83 259.33 B: you know people wouldn't you know or people would be in the minority to to be that way to their what that's that movie with jimmy stewart the christmas movie 

259.47 261.25 A: uh 

260.38 261.91 B: it's a wonderful life 

261.28 262.22 A: yes 

261.99 266.13 B: i mean in some of that there was embezzlement and all you know 

266.34 269.68 B: but um i don't know i like to think it's 

270.00 276.42 B: the um unusual rather than the norm and i don't know that's why i'm saying i don't even know if government 

276.51 280.11 B: could do anything or if they even should do anything 

280.71 282.15 B: because i mean 

282.29 286.92 B: [mn] a lot of things don't prevent crime so i don't know how anything would be 

286.39 287.75 A: [cough] 

287.15 292.15 B: prevented unless they just audited every single step of the way and tha- 

291.34 293.36 A: right right exactly 

292.77 299.93 B: and that's just like a whole another layer on top of government things now and you know i don't know 

298.93 299.49 A: (( [mn] )) 

299.55 309.82 A: yeah i mean i mean the generalized topic that we're talking about is really not so generalized because it it involves damn near everything if you really think about it 

309.91 311.27 B: exactly 

310.49 312.94 A: i mean you you just you don't know 

313.11 321.53 A: when to open your mouth when to get involved when to shut up when to not get involved you know i- it's and and i'm sure they go through the same things that we do 

322.36 326.53 A: but i think that being in their background where most of them 

326.54 332.07 A: most of them i'm not going to say all of them but i i would say a good percentage of them are attorneys 

332.40 333.60 B: right in that 

332.69 335.51 A: all the elected officials were attorneys at one time 

335.18 341.12 B: right and if they are not attorneys then they have very close relationships with attorneys 

340.54 341.82 A: right 

341.20 347.28 B: you know where someone like i don't you know i've never used an attorney in my life i've never had a reason to 

347.47 353.53 B: you know so i don't you know i don't have any relationship i know i just think the government 

353.88 361.00 B: i don't know we can only get involved in so much i mean you just have to depend on people as people to 

360.70 362.07 A: right right 

361.34 362.34 B: you know 

362.99 366.50 B: [mn] you just did this survey did you just talk to someone else about this or 

365.79 367.51 A: yeah exactly 

366.92 370.05 B: oh my god and then what did they do call you back or 

367.76 368.60 A: (( yeah )) 

369.53 373.15 A: no no no you can you can call another number 

373.43 378.18 A: you can call a number and then ge- and get put in a pool and talk to somebody else about the same thing 

377.94 379.26 B: really you can call 

378.49 380.60 A: yeah you can do that up to three times 

381.39 383.19 B: three times a day or 

382.50 388.69 A: yeah i i i assume that's what it says in my email it doesn't say per day but it says up to three calls 

388.34 396.38 B: yeah and see i don't know because i just actually missed one of their calls on my phone you know by the time i picked it up it had already gone into my voice mail 

395.74 397.05 A: right 

396.45 406.98 B: so i just called i said well let me call and i don't you know i didn't quite understand the way the whole thing i mean i do understand but i didn't know if i thought it was just three 

407.18 408.22 B: you know 

408.51 415.09 B: because does anyone know like this is getting off the topic but like how we get paid i mean do they do it on i mean 

414.92 423.55 A: well you you submitted all that information and i'm sure that they'll they'll do whatever they got to do but you can participate in up to three calls 

424.37 428.63 A: lottery and all that stuff but you you know you're supposed to talk about the tub- 

428.40 440.07 A: the subject for at least eight minutes of the conversation and so on and so forth i mean this is all new to me i heard it on the radio but the interesting part is you never know what the topic is going to be 

439.46 447.64 B: yeah i mean like i said this is only the second one i've done and the one i did the other day was family so that was a much more general 

447.03 448.79 A: oh yeah yeah 

448.12 450.71 B: general topic that i was you know 

449.92 451.99 A: and they called you one time for that right 

451.98 456.07 B: yeah actually i called in on that one too because i just wanted to see how it would work 

455.50 456.35 A: (( aha )) 

456.30 457.42 B: and um 

457.71 462.24 B: [lipsmack] i talked to a a young college student and she was very interesting and 

461.58 465.40 A: yeah and you know it it it i i guess it's i don't know 

465.52 470.56 A: i guess the purpose is i don't know if they monitor or whatever it is but you know 

470.83 473.88 A: who knows maybe the government has their hands in this too 

473.19 487.61 B: no i had actually thought of that that's why i thought of that because i said wow you know everything looks cool but i don't remember seeing any placing what day we would get a cheque like what day of what month or anything like that and then i'm thinking 

473.93 475.38 A: [laughter] 

480.88 481.75 A: [cough] 

485.18 488.18 A: right right and you don't that 

487.52 491.76 B: what if this is all part of a government thing to see how we would react 

491.11 492.26 A: that's true 

491.83 499.84 B: to the government should they be controlled what if this what if we're all uh test subjects to see if they need more government regulation 

499.45 501.84 A: right yeah i mean we we don't know 

501.86 504.05 A: and i guess that's what you know 

504.51 508.05 A: that's probably what this survey is about 

507.93 516.56 B: hm i'm wondering if they just throw out topics to see how two people i don't know i know i'm getting off the topic but it's it's you know i mean it 

508.60 509.63 A: to see 

515.93 517.53 A: to see how they converse 

517.21 518.83 B: well exactly 

518.23 520.79 A: yes that could that could very well be true too 

520.46 521.92 B: you know because 

521.12 528.90 A: i mean i mean it it's it's very it's puzzling but then again it's sort of like attractive because you don't know 

529.46 533.49 A: who you're talking to number one and you don't know what they're going to say number two 

533.21 543.80 B: oh yeah i know it it's fascinating to like i i mean this particular topic i mean you know i've seen this on c._n._n. and the corporate scandals s- and all that 

543.73 553.71 B: because it hasn't affected me directly i haven't really i've never even given a thought to what the government should do only because it doesn't have any bearing 

550.29 551.38 A: right 

553.95 566.50 B: personally on me you know if i was somebody obviously involved in enron or involved in one of these companies i would be you know totally thinking of what the government should do but 

554.88 556.41 A: yes exactly 

558.66 559.43 A: (( [cough] )) 

565.61 570.84 A: i mean [mn] in a situation like me i just got my annual performance raise 

570.88 579.39 A: and i got a decent annual por- performance raise and i was willing to i was ready to dump a certain percentage in of that into my 401k 

579.84 582.18 A: but then it sort of makes you think 

582.35 586.15 A: if you're dumping it in there what's what's really protecting it 

585.77 592.26 B: i know that's i mean i wonder that too even about social security that's why i don't know if the government 

592.48 597.10 B: how they you know it seems like they're having trouble running social security 

596.74 597.82 A: right 

597.15 599.89 B: so to start you know monitoring pr-
