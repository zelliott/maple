147.69 149.01 A: oh okay 

148.26 152.74 B: but we've always had this big cart that you attach to the back of the bikes 

152.23 161.02 A: my sister gave me hers and i'm hoping this summer i'm hoping this summer to uh do it the funny thing is is she gave it to me and she lives across country and 

161.09 166.51 A: and she gave it to me all folded up and i can't figure out how to open it up [laughter] 

165.12 169.03 B: ooh yeah you probably have to put all the wheels on and everything 

168.47 169.76 A: yeah and 

169.04 171.83 B: yeah that'll take you some time to figure it out [laughter] 

171.23 176.25 A: yeah 'cause i'm usually pretty good at those things and i and i didn't have a clue [laughter] 

175.17 178.02 B: yeah yeah it might take you a little time 

177.58 179.57 A: yeah to figure out 

178.56 187.26 B: we we started doing that just when the kids were little and we'd go on vacation we'd have to get two carts because none of them could really bike safely by themselves 

184.12 184.93 A: wow 

186.83 187.63 A: right 

187.41 191.57 B: and then we got to where we were down to one cart and one in a baby seat 

191.21 192.36 A: oh that's good 

191.51 199.64 B: and one on her own bike and now we're down to two on their own bikes and two in a cart [laughter] so slowly we're working out of all this but um 

194.89 196.94 A: [laughter] 

199.55 211.91 B: we we love to do that we actually had the cart flip over on us one time the children were fine but my husband took a corner pretty quickly just having a good time with them and sure enough they just toppled right over 

203.17 204.07 A: ooh 

207.21 208.19 A: right

215.83 216.69 A: right 

219.96 220.96 A: right 

220.67 227.01 B: so yeah we did not put the helmets on the ones in the carts but we're learned the older kids have always done the helmets but 

226.84 227.95 A: yeah 

227.20 233.09 B: they um yeah we we we need to be always better about putting on the ones in the cart as well
