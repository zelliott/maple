0.70 1.93 A: (( [noise] hi )) 

2.44 4.41 B: hi i'm pamela anderson 

4.69 6.42 A: um yes can you hear me 

6.41 9.02 B: yes i can i'm on a cell phone 

7.78 8.49 A: hi 

8.77 12.34 A: me too [laughter] that was the easiest way to be reached my name's connell 

12.59 13.76 B: hi 

13.89 15.98 B: what was the question they were asking 

16.18 23.10 A: well they had um two sets of questions the first one is do you like i believe warm weather activities or cold weather activities 

23.49 28.03 A: and then it said um do you prefer inside activities or outside activities 

28.68 30.54 A: so those were the two sets 

31.10 31.81 B: (( oh )) 

31.93 33.73 A: (( [noise] which is fairly easy )) 

33.88 35.66 B: yeah it is 

35.82 40.46 B: let's see i like ah what do i like i like both 

40.72 44.55 B: but actually i'm in washington so i like it kind of cooler 

44.21 45.45 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

45.07 49.24 B: so our ah summers are cooler so i like that 

48.95 55.79 A: yeah and you know what for me it's kind of different b- not different but you know there's there's so different in activities that you could do 

55.86 67.44 A: [noise] but i guess the best one for me would be year round because you can play football when it's cold even when it's hot and you can play basketball when it's cold or hot but i guess the definition is if it's snowing do you think that's it 

68.28 74.20 B: yeah that would that would limit it [laughter] you can't play tennis too well while going snowing 

71.15 72.95 A: yeah [laughter] 

73.82 82.72 A: exactly unless you're [laughter] yeah you can't do that [laughter] it would be kind of slippery but i so i would say i would like it better with um warm weather activities 

74.55 77.11 B: (( snowing [laughter] )) 

82.89 87.64 B: yeah i agree but i like to ski we like to snowboard 

87.03 88.46 A: mhm mhm 

87.89 89.92 B: we like the mountains 

89.62 90.84 A: yeah that is fun 

91.08 99.19 A: [noise] in california you only have like a month or two where you could do it really like when it's really when the sno- snow's really good because i don't like the artificial snow that they produce 

91.23 92.31 B: so we [mn] 

99.16 102.69 B: oh yeah my brother lives down there 

99.34 100.21 A: so 

100.48 102.21 A: that's pretty bad 

102.82 104.23 B: in california 

102.93 112.91 A: yeah and it's [mn] it's really hard here like during the um the winter seasons and stuff like that you have such a limited time for the snow to be there and it's like good snow rather than the slush [noise] 

113.35 114.99 B: oh yeah 

114.35 117.23 A: and so that's why i think i prefer the warm weather ones better 

117.06 119.64 B: well tahoe has some nice ones though 

117.38 118.16 A: so 

119.43 120.52 A: yeah they do 

120.91 127.34 A: yeah they do but i prefer like the the warm weather ones just like ball games and you know like right now 

126.22 128.61 B: scuba diving [laughter] 

127.80 134.88 A: yeah it's just it's just nice and then you get to be outside but not in the dead middle of summer because that's kind of painful [laughter] 

131.49 132.21 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

135.32 145.54 B: yeah i agree [mn] air conditioning city so i'd like between the spring or the fall time are my favorite times for here in washington 

138.77 139.83 A: yep 

143.76 144.97 A: yep 

145.40 147.68 A: mhm i can imagine that 

146.11 150.72 B: because it's [mn] not too hot and not too cold and not a lot of raining 

149.23 150.10 A: mhm 

150.81 152.59 B: (( [laughter] )) 

152.34 155.39 A: that's true because when it's raining you can't do anything 

155.54 157.62 A: pretty much any outdoor sports 

155.92 162.27 B: well actually no not in washington in washington we pretty much do everything that we always do 

162.47 163.99 A: during the rain also 

163.84 169.61 B: (( yeah [laughter] [mn] except for gol- [mn] we go golfing we ah )) 

165.10 165.87 A: (( [mn] )) 

168.74 170.06 A: (( oh that's true )) 

169.73 173.90 B: [noise] we do all that stuff and so 

172.99 180.19 A: you have to because ah i guess in places where it rains inconsistently you have to just kind of go through it or else [mn] you'd be stuck 

174.16 175.77 B: [laughter] 

179.02 181.29 B: well you don't really notice it [mn] 

180.96 181.99 A: really 

181.97 185.18 B: yeah after a while it's pretty much 

187.13 189.32 B: it's pretty much just ah 

190.96 192.02 B: (( i don't know )) 

192.22 193.87 B: you don't notice it [noise] 

194.24 195.33 B: at all 

194.29 202.26 A: that's true and i guess i'm spoilt because if it's like a sprinkling i'm like all right time time to [mn] bring the game inside we can't play anymore that's just how i am 

201.17 202.58 B: [laughter] 

202.34 213.08 A: the floor's [laughter] the floor's too wet i'm going to slip and someone's going to get hurt so but i like it when it's like you know basically like right now in california it's sunny but then there's a nice breeze 

202.64 203.51 B: [laughter] 

213.18 214.22 B: (( mhm )) 

213.43 220.27 A: so i i think that'll be like the optimal time to p- to play any type of outdoor sports except for of course skiing because you can't [laughter] 

220.52 224.06 A: but um so how do you do you prefer indoor or outdoor sports better 

225.17 230.18 B: ah my husband likes outdoor sports i like ah outdoor sports 

230.10 235.72 A: mhm i think it's easier yeah it's easier to do the out- out- outdoor sports um 

230.38 231.76 B: i agree 

236.03 248.97 A: [noise] in comparison to the indoors because there's not really a lot of things that you could do indoors when you think about it there's not too many venues that you could actually unless you go to a gym that has like the racquetball courts and you know indoor pools and stuff like that 

248.95 250.22 B: right 

249.71 250.67 A: (( [noise] so )) 

250.87 262.00 A: i think there's m- you know you could do more things when you're outside you know when when the weather's good even when it's cold because you have you know your variety of things that you know you could do in the winter and in the summer 

265.51 267.51 A: i'm not really s- yeah i'm 

265.58 266.76 B: i agree 

267.74 274.87 A: not really sure what else you could say except if we talk about individual sports that we d- that you could do [laughter] if we start listing them 

275.27 276.49 B: that's true 

276.98 280.69 B: (( i don't know i like bicycle riding [laughter] )) 

279.22 290.41 A: you know what that's that's right that's another type of sports yeah those are two sports and then like also there's hiking that you could do in nice weather [noise] and that burns off a lot of calories 

281.51 282.73 B: and swimming 

286.97 287.87 B: yep 

290.35 291.74 B: yeah it does 

291.71 294.14 A: [noise] [noise] and you know what 

292.19 294.96 B: i'm recording this [laughter] 

294.27 296.62 A: oh really [laughter] i'm im- 

295.32 302.11 B: yeah well i'm doing a i'm doing a mystery shop right now and you called right [mn] they called right in the middle of it 

301.12 303.58 A: oh i'm so sorry about that [laughter] 

302.56 306.82 B: that's not your fault [laughter] really nice though 

303.89 308.41 A: oh that's true it's their fault i've been waiting for one [laughter] it is it's nice 

307.14 309.20 B: oh have you is this your first one 

309.20 310.41 A: this phone call 

310.29 312.08 B: yeah 

311.04 312.08 A: yes 

312.24 313.70 B: oh ok- 

312.58 313.40 A: (( yeah )) 

313.76 314.90 A: i've been waiting 

314.20 316.02 B: oh i didn't know that 

315.96 317.79 A: yeah i just 

316.08 317.83 B: (( this is my seventh )) 

317.84 318.81 B: [laughter] 

317.89 321.56 A: [mn] i signed up like maybe a week ago and this is the first phone call 

321.49 322.95 B: oh 

322.85 324.28 A: yeah so i 

323.25 327.93 B: yeah there's a lot of them i'm on my seventh one now so i'm not quite sure what they're doing 

324.92 325.48 A: (( [mn] )) 

327.98 329.91 B: i'm going to have to give them a call 

329.28 332.49 A: [noise] and see exactly what they want us to specify 

332.19 332.96 B: (( ahah )) 

332.73 343.97 A: it's pretty [mn] you know [mn] you know there's only so much that you could say about in- you know pretty much indoor sports yeah i like indoor or outdoor sports ah what do you like better winter [laughter] or summer [laughter] basically and that's pretty much it 

344.18 345.97 A: but i think i think 

344.33 348.13 B: yeah i agree i don't know what else you can say about it 

347.31 348.80 A: yeah i just think 

349.01 353.56 A: sum it up i think that you could do more things um when it's 

353.99 358.12 A: [noise] you know with warm weather compared to cold weather 

358.33 361.71 A: although there's [mn] both numerous things that you could do with each one 

361.90 368.20 A: but my ah preference is the warm weather and i believe that i like outdoor sports better than i do indoor sports [noise] 

369.75 377.43 B: yeah so if you're ah if you like the cold weather then you like to snuggle and you like to be indoors more of the time 

376.05 377.42 A: yep 

377.49 379.96 B: or you like to ski where 

380.09 386.32 B: if it's [mn] you like the outdoors well then you like the summer time and you do more outdoor things than indoor 

386.25 387.87 A: correct and then 

386.96 390.08 B: pretty much sums it up doesn't it 

388.41 401.26 A: yeah [laughter] it does [laughter] and because [mn] besides like indoor sports like th- this is just my ideas just that you have to have you know some type of money to be able to perform indoor sports where actual there's activity going on 

390.34 391.56 B: [laughter] 

401.02 405.80 A: like for me indoor sports since i have kids it's more like um 

405.96 415.99 A: just games and hide and go seek and stuff like that activities more than sports so and it's always better to be outside you burn you know more energy that way and 

409.73 411.97 B: yeah 

415.98 421.96 B: that's true the sun feels nice at least it does right now [laughter] [laughter] 

416.10 428.55 A: you could relax outside yeah yeah it does it does [laughter] i'm happy for the weather right now and plus when you when you go in- when you're inside doing something you just you know you wind up feeling so confined 

423.08 424.21 B: me too 

428.88 431.31 A: because of the walls and the ceiling and 

430.70 433.22 B: i think you do we don't [laughter] 

432.67 433.89 A: [laughter] 

433.28 436.00 B: [laughter] we're snugglers in our family 

435.86 447.51 A: we are too but you know i guess [mn] most of the time [mn] during the day it's just me and my daughter and the only thing that we have to do are just like basically coloring and just indoor things where if we're outside we can do a whole 

447.48 452.18 A: you know lot of other things so we're we're not too 

451.15 451.71 B: (( [mn] )) 

452.41 458.39 A: it's strange because if you really ask me how many times i go outside during the day [laughter] it depends on what i have to do [laughter] [laughter] 

458.59 460.63 B: that's true that's true 

460.72 465.99 B: i i kind of a stay at home mom more or less but my kids are all older so 

466.02 468.32 B: i'm more of a run around mom now 

468.20 471.65 A: oh goodness my daughter she's um in 

469.90 474.52 B: [laughter] but i do like to drive in the in the sunshine more than i do the rain 

474.50 483.83 A: it's true it's just also it's like a safety concern also because you figure you don't there's not r- a lot of well there of course there's because they didn't scratch it but during um 

474.92 476.78 B: [laughter] 

478.99 481.67 B: (( mhm )) 

483.89 497.93 A: the winter time when you have to drive to places that are you know that you're going to be attending sports games or anything else and you know there's more of a danger involved because of the wet roads and then when you're playing the slippery ground whereas the summer it's just like oh it's a nice day let's go [laughter] 

498.32 500.29 B: that's true that's true 

501.42 508.58 B: oh boy you know you run out of things to talk about with this this ah subject i haven't had that problem with the other subjects 

502.53 503.49 A: [laughter] 

506.09 507.63 A: (( yeah )) 

508.40 512.24 A: really what kind of what kind of other subjects do you usually 

508.73 510.07 B: this is weird 

511.09 516.54 B: ah one was on saddam hussein and iraq and the other one was ah 

516.82 518.79 B: shoot what were they um 

519.74 523.27 B: oh gosh i've done so many now i don't know which 

523.83 530.42 A: well you know i think it's [mn] it's it's better when you have a broader subject to talk about because there's you know a lot of things that you could say 

524.20 525.02 B: they've 

530.46 533.24 B: i know you're really limited 

530.81 531.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

532.37 540.01 A: [mn] yeah this is so it's not a very good [mn] first experience for me [laughter] but it's good enough you know i stated my case i like what i like [laughter] 

540.29 544.91 B: yeah i did too and then you've just kind of run out of things to talk about i 

544.43 546.47 A: yeah exactly 

545.09 548.91 B: wonder if they're trying that but that's what this is all about if i'm not mistaken 

549.19 550.33 A: just about ma- 

549.35 550.38 B: is ah 

550.43 553.76 B: not the subject but just how we interact with one another 

553.49 554.72 A: oh really 

554.67 555.86 B: i think so 

555.66 559.95 A: oh because it's a study for a a university is that correct and and what okay 

558.26 560.08 B: yes yes it is 

560.19 567.10 A: okay well they have to get the right people because there's a lot of people that will just not say anything else and you know 

560.47 561.51 B: yeah 

566.05 569.15 B: well they record all this so then they know what we're saying 

569.07 573.95 A: yeah pretty much i [mn] i'd love to have that job listening in on this phone call [laughter] 

570.03 571.49 B: [laughter] 

573.59 580.22 B: [laughter] i know but you know they got to pick subjects that have a little more detail or issues involved to um 

578.18 579.22 A: yes 

580.26 587.59 B: controversial or otherwise but just talking about the sun and the winter and the weather and so on it's 

582.17 583.66 A: mhm that's true 

587.63 588.99 B: kind of boring 

587.99 596.22 A: and it and that's yeah exactly and like like all the topics it's everybody's preference but um [mn] it's a little bit more limited with this one 

596.26 599.80 A: [noise] just because it is just so cut and that's it
