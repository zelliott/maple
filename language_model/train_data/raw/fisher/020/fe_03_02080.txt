246.65 250.64 A: i mean we we have um 

251.11 256.68 A: we have snow about every four or five years and when i say snow i mean

261.01 265.79 B: oh i'm originally from michigan so i know the cold weather [laughter] 

265.85 268.11 A: ooh you really do 

267.97 271.99 B: yes and the weather from up there and down here is very different [laughter] 

272.69 276.91 A: and from where you are to where i am it's probably even 

276.97 279.03 A: that much different again 

278.58 279.75 B: probably 

279.48 280.55 A: yeah 

281.19 292.31 A: now i don't think i could take really really cold weather i just wouldn't well in the first place i wouldn't know how to i wouldn't know how to handle myself i wouldn't know how to um 

283.79 284.70 B: [laughter] 

292.70 298.33 A: to navigate we can't drive in the ice and snow because we never have 

297.21 303.54 B: yeah and that's the way people are around here whenever we get a snow they're at the grocery store buying everything [laughter] 

302.92 304.02 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

304.62 305.66 B: so [laughter] 

304.87 306.00 A: and uh 

306.06 315.48 A: [lipsmack] so it i i'd be dangerous if i were out and as a matter of fact when i have vacationed where there is snow i can hardly walk 

315.66 318.26 A: i don't know how to stay up on it you know 

318.38 321.74 B: yep i understand 

318.49 319.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

319.74 323.61 A: i keep wishing i had cleats in my shoes so i wouldn't slip 

323.42 324.25 B: (( oh [lipsmack] )) 

324.82 328.05 B: i don't know if that would help you here or not [laughter] 

327.64 329.76 A: i don't i've seen uh 

330.48 335.89 A: [mn] i've seen rubber band things that you put over your shoes and the bottom of 'em have like uh 

336.16 340.67 A: well they look almost like cleats but they're little razor blade sort of points 

340.21 341.01 B: uh-huh 

341.12 342.29 A: so that 

342.61 345.39 A: your weight digs them into the ice 

345.51 346.29 B: (( huh )) 

345.53 349.21 A: supposedly i don't know if they work or not because i've never 

349.55 353.26 A: tried them but it looks like it would keep you from slipping 

350.63 351.67 B: (( [mn] )) 

354.28 358.08 B: i don't know i've never tried 'em or i've never seem 'em [laughter] 

357.34 360.61 A: [laughter] maybe they just sell 'em to southerners 

360.99 364.05 B: [lipsmack] i don't know [laughter] it'd be something 

361.94 363.20 A: [laughter] 

364.14 365.16 A: yeah 

365.66 367.84 B: you do you keep your grandchildren 

368.44 378.28 A: sometimes i do uh but i work and so unless it's some sort of real emergency or unless it's a holiday i don't usually keep them 

378.20 381.29 B: oh you guys would play games or somethi- 

380.06 386.03 A: and besides that they're getting up pretty big now they're about they're fourteen and twelve 

385.41 386.27 B: oh 

386.28 388.35 A: so they don't need much keeping 

388.07 391.36 B: they're pretty well dependent on their own self [laughter] 

390.70 392.03 A: right 

392.80 397.77 A: so i don't i don't sit with them very much i used to sit with them when they were 

398.19 405.50 A: you know toddlers but now they don't need me [lipsmack] and my mother lives with them 

401.86 402.50 B: (( hm ))

431.07 435.56 A: but when i was a girl when i was raised at the coast 

435.65 436.41 B: (( oh )) 

435.87 442.14 A: on the gulf coast and so we used to play beach volleyball volleyball a lot 

441.73 444.74 B: yeah volleyball's a lot of fun ah it's a lot of fun to play you 

444.59 445.58 A: yeah 

445.28 448.64 B: can get a lot of exercise from it [laughter] 

447.09 460.92 A: yeah we used to play at the beach and the sand is good we used to play barefooted it was before there were there was any fear from needles and things like that and uh the sand was really good for your feet it polished 'em 

455.95 457.03 B: yeah 

460.97 468.44 B: well we usually play out in our front yard and it's grass so we usually i usually kick my shoes off and play without any shoes on [laughter] 

467.04 471.64 A: oh yeah that's good you must have a large yard 

470.93 473.52 B: (( we have a pretty big yard )) 

473.04 478.16 A: yeah well it sounds like you guys do a lot of activities outside 

473.74 474.89 B: my husband 

477.42 482.21 B: we do my husband he works outside because he he's an outdoorsman anyways 

482.40 483.67 A: what does he do 

483.38 485.12 B: uh he lays asphalt 

485.61 486.94 A: oh 

485.88 487.67 B: works for an asphalt company 

488.22 491.99 B: so he's outdoors in hot hot weather [laughter] 

493.48 499.01 A: so is asphalt as expensive as concrete or less 

493.55 494.34 B: (( [cough] )) 

498.80 499.57 B: (( uh )) 

499.70 502.57 B: i think asphalt's more expensive than concrete is 

502.73 504.66 A: more expensive 

503.92 505.39 B: yep 

505.29 506.67 A: that's amazing 

506.82 508.53 B: yes it is [laughter] 

507.77 513.82 A: i always thought that it was less expensive and somebody told me a couple of years ago that they were about 

513.83 521.56 A: the same price and i was shocked so i was that's why i was checking with you just to find out if the information i had was true 

521.37 529.53 B: i think concrete's a lot less expensive i think asphalt's more it costs more uh 'cause all the work that you had to put in to the asphalt 

523.92 524.74 A: wh- 

528.84 530.07 A: oh 

529.96 538.73 B: 'cause you have to remember you put it down you have the paver that goes over it then you have rollers that go over it to give get it level and 

539.23 543.62 A: right and so the only bad thing about it is that 

544.16 547.61 A: diesel fuel will ruin it is that right 

547.38 550.63 B: no they use diesel on it uh-huh 

549.30 550.24 A: they do 

551.48 552.84 B: the smell 

551.65 555.40 A: well somebody told me if you had a diesel spill on it it would hurt it 

555.44 556.95 B: it may make it weak 

557.15 558.08 A: oh 

557.91 559.16 B: but see they use 

559.71 563.75 B: they use it and they have to keep watering the rollers 

563.99 568.22 B: to keep the asphalt from sticking to the rollers 

567.03 568.50 A: oh i see 

569.46 572.38 B: so it's pretty cool [laughter] 

572.60 574.89 B: i try to learn what i can [laughter] 

574.08 576.83 A: pretty hot work in the summer i bet 

576.56 581.31 B: yes ma'am it is he usually comes in and he's hot and tired 

580.77 582.11 A: i'll bet 

582.14 583.70 A: oh yeah 

583.33 592.53 B: i don't guess he gets enough of the outdoors whenever it rains he usually finds something to do in the house either watch movies or play on the computer or play games 

585.77 586.90 A: hm 

594.16 596.67 B: [mn] about all we can do whenever it rains uh 

596.93 599.60 A: so how many of these calls have you made
