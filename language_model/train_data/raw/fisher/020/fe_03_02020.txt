69.77 81.33 B: for your personal gain we can cut off one arm and if it's a million dollars we'll cut off two arms you know [laughter] and and so forth and m- maybe that would be a bit of a in- incentive not to or some- [laughter] 

74.89 77.19 A: oh wow [laughter] 

79.13 87.10 A: i [mn] i would think that would do it i would think that would do it especially if he didn't have any arms or legs left he couldn't do much of anything so 

87.11 89.24 A: guess it's learning a lesson the hard way 

87.18 88.19 B: well 

89.31 90.52 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah ))

97.95 101.56 A: i think we need to punish those guys severely i mean 

100.82 102.22 B: mhm 

101.85 106.43 A: you know take their little toys away from them you know put them in a regular house like 

107.25 110.64 A: you know the people that work for them and and just let them 

111.11 111.92 A: you know 

112.27 113.79 B: mhm yeah 

112.55 117.37 A: live their life the way the [mn] a way the way the average person would have to live it and 

117.45 118.61 A: and um 

119.18 123.66 A: [noise] actually they should go to prison and their families could live just a normal life 

123.52 125.26 B: yeah 

124.16 128.38 A: [noise] you know i just don't i think we we pamper them too much 

128.37 133.47 B: have you have you um do you happen to read the the cartoon strip doonesbury 

133.42 135.75 A: i have yeah 

134.80 142.63 B: i remem- i remember back um [mn] after after it all came out but when they wh- when things started getting um 

142.86 154.73 B: cleared up and and so forth they they ran a s- a series where they had the ken lay and his wife were um having like a a yard sale [sigh] of their house all the contents to [laughter] to pay for the bill- 

152.11 153.31 A: (( oh i think that )) 

154.70 155.57 A: yep i 

154.79 162.50 B: bills and liabilities and stuff it was he he he stuck some really good [laughter] um just commentary in there 

157.00 159.27 A: i think i saw that 

163.01 167.07 A: yeah i think i remember seeing that i don't remember actually what it said but 

166.70 167.89 B: yeah 

167.30 168.72 A: yeah i thought it was 

169.16 174.72 A: it was pretty good and i [mn] well i don't know i know they're not talking about 

174.80 181.00 A: um you know the presidential things and stuff but i even think when the clintons left the white house and 

180.93 181.97 B: [laughter] 

181.56 183.03 A: took some of their little 

183.14 187.24 A: gifts along with them i thought you know that they should be penalized for it you know 

187.07 189.30 B: well it's probably true mhm mm 

187.65 192.39 A: and it it shouldn't have been what they wanted to pay for it i think they you know 

189.89 196.04 B: (( hm )) 

193.16 199.32 A: it's like [mn] you know i think it it shows like the younger kids if you're rich you can get what you want 

199.94 200.87 A: (( you know )) 

200.93 203.22 A: but yet let the poor guy 

203.40 206.56 A: take something that doesn't belong to him and you know 

207.49 215.81 A: they go to prison and and i think it should just you know it shouldn't be based on what you have [noise] as to what you get 

214.21 215.30 B: yeah 

216.28 226.64 B: i'll have to admit that if if i had been working in the white house you know as some you know little desk worker or something i- it would be pretty tempting to to have a little fun on your way out [mn] 

226.51 237.71 A: [mn] well i think some of the things could be legitimately [noise] called gifts and stuff but you know when you walk out with all of the the china and the silverware and the goblets and you know 

236.18 237.66 B: mhm 

237.78 242.69 B: (( yeah [mn] th- th- th- th- th- there's certainly [mn] [mn] yeah you )) 

237.79 238.90 A: and um 

239.87 242.62 A: linen [laughter] you know i 

242.71 247.79 A: i think there is there's a limit as to what you should be able to call yours [noise] 

247.21 250.04 B: mhm th- th- th- that's definitely true 

251.74 255.65 A: oh i don't know i don't know it's just but i i do think like 

252.86 253.66 B: (( mm )) 

255.93 263.32 A: i think there's been so many things come out about them you know these big businesses and stuff and these people that have have um 

264.20 273.30 A: you know sold their stocks and and pocketed their money and everything while they're telling the employees just to hang loose you know and and be cool and stick with them 

264.78 265.89 B: (( [noise] )) 

273.45 286.17 A: you know and and they they made their big bucks and everything and then their employees lost all of their money i just think that they they need to make an example of them because i think it's happening more and more because people are getting away with it 

273.68 275.27 B: mhm yeah 

285.94 288.12 B: i think that's true um 

288.74 293.90 B: it's [mn] i'm a i'm a college student right now and [mn] the um 

291.02 291.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

294.04 298.30 B: the the the question of ethics in business has been 

298.51 310.91 B: um often raised in it's one of our favorite things we do to to make fun of the business students [laughter] point out you know you don't even have ethics classes how can you claim to [laughter] support them and stuff 

308.72 310.09 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

310.96 311.99 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

312.12 315.17 A: that's true [laughter] i um 

313.90 315.11 B: yeah 

315.70 319.17 A: i have not worked in a while so i i um i 

320.57 325.89 A: don't know i've been out of the work field for for quite a while now but i but i just think you know 

326.27 332.34 A: i just think that you know employees [mn] well even even um american airlines what they've gone through you know 

332.38 333.45 B: mhm 

332.91 333.82 A: (( [noise] um )) 

333.92 337.92 A: you know they talked their employees out of raises and and you know 

338.71 353.05 A: [noise] um i have a [noise] a nephew that works for them and and they take you know pay cuts and or other compensations and stuff and and yet these employees ah these big shots have given themselves big bonuses you know where they haven't actually they haven't actually taken 

349.45 350.75 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

352.45 353.64 B: [noise] 

352.96 362.11 A: from their employees you know as far as because they haven't gone bankrupt yet [noise] but you know if they go bankrupt they're they're still have padded their pockets now 

356.87 357.98 B: yeah 

362.30 368.15 A: and if they go bankrupt their employees are out of a job and they might be out of a job too but they have more money to show for it 

362.39 363.92 B: (( mm hm )) 

367.97 370.41 B: (( [noise] indeed yeah i )) 

368.67 379.03 A: [noise] so i i just think they need to make an example to some of these places more than just a slap on the hands because i don't think it's going to stop until they you know these people are punished 

374.26 374.91 B: (( mm )) 

378.83 382.93 B: hm i'm i'm kind of wondering if it's 

383.04 385.01 B: something that can stop i mean 

386.05 387.56 B: is it is it say 

387.99 395.56 B: you know [mn] something that is just almost irresistible to people in charge of large amounts of money or is it just a 

395.89 399.49 B: you know [noise] whe- when you're when you're making all these decisions 

400.74 401.63 B: i mean 

402.18 411.15 B: i g- i guess it's it's not [mn] entirely clear to me that i- that it's you know something we can get rid of not that we shouldn't do anything about it but i'm 

411.42 414.46 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] oh i think they could get rid of it i think if 

411.58 412.73 B: not 

414.16 415.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

414.47 422.73 A: i think if there was more of a [noise] um what do they call it um um [mn] i can't even think of the term they use like check on 

421.94 423.55 B: deterrent or [lipsmack] 

423.08 424.14 A: well 

424.20 425.87 A: no just like 

426.12 428.42 A: you know if they have more of [mn] a 

428.73 430.61 A: (( gosh what am i thinking )) 

430.70 431.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

431.44 437.07 A: (( um you know like they check on people i can't think of what [mn] what it is )) 

434.67 439.56 B: more more um oversight or auditing or something 

437.76 445.00 A: yes yeah yeah i think if i think if well people pad their their figures too but i think if there was 

443.53 444.68 B: mhm 

445.17 457.69 A: if the i think maybe an audit would do it i don't know if i would if it would be an audit or if it would be [noise] like a committee that would go over every book in every detail you know to see where the money is actually going 

457.86 458.88 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

458.66 461.28 A: i i think it could be done and i think you have to 

461.86 467.38 A: have honest people you know that run these corporations [noise] you know it it 

468.36 472.76 A: they know what they're doing they know if they're being underhanded or not you know 

472.40 473.50 B: yeah 

472.91 474.87 A: they know if they know if they're ah 

475.96 489.98 A: [noise] giving themself a raise when they're asking their employees not to take a raise or they [mn] they know that that they cashed in all these stocks and stuff but yet they've told their employees to hold on to them knowing that the stocks are going to drop you know 

489.23 490.80 B: mhm 

490.05 497.77 A: so i i think they could put a stop to it if they would [noise] if they'd really go after them [noise] [noise] 

494.25 495.96 B: oh you're you're probably 

496.31 504.21 B: yeah mhm well you're i i think you're certainly right [mn] they they definitely know what they're doing um 

505.01 508.56 B: i guess there's a question of whether 

509.18 512.06 B: do they actually think of it as wrong 

513.55 514.74 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

516.54 517.66 A: (( [noise] well )) 

518.87 521.14 A: [noise] i don't know i would think 

521.43 525.38 A: [noise] i don't know i i would definite- i believe they think it's wrong 

525.89 526.75 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

526.06 533.33 A: [noise] i i think if they didn't then why wouldn't they just admit to what's going on [noise] you know why would they try to cover it up [noise] 

532.29 538.75 B: well [mn] there there there's a difference between doing something you think is wrong and something that other people think is wrong 

539.44 540.46 B: i mean 

541.87 545.46 B: ah [mn] trying to think of a e- easy example but it i mean [mn] 

542.00 543.48 A: no it's 

544.65 548.09 A: [mn] well yeah i know what you're saying and and that's true 

548.10 553.01 A: that's true that there is a difference because you see things the way you want to see them you know 

552.09 552.99 B: mhm 

553.43 554.60 A: [noise] but um 

555.91 566.65 A: [noise] i just think if if i tell somebody you know not to do this because the company is going to be okay and then i don't have enough faith in the company that i'm selling my stock 

567.47 579.63 A: and i'm going to make sure that i sell it quick enough to get my money back out of it or most of my money out of it you know i'm not going to take a big loss but yet i'm telling these people to hold on to theirs you know 

567.59 568.78 B: mhm 

573.70 574.62 B: mhm 

579.59 586.45 A: i should be holding on to mine if i have that much faith in the company i mean after all i'm i'm one of the big shots and and you know 

585.71 587.26 B: mhm yeah 

587.04 592.12 A: i just so i [noise] i think they know that that they were in the wrong i really do 

589.87 591.61 B: mhm 

592.72 593.57 B: (( [laughter] )) 

594.82 597.72 A: tell me you're the head of enron [laughter] 

598.92 599.95 A: or or
