242.24 245.19 A: okay we need to talk about something else about warm weather 

244.69 246.23 B: [laughter] okay 

245.28 247.66 A: [laughter] 

246.53 250.85 B: [laughter] it's so funny it's such it's it's a limited topic i would say i mean 

251.01 258.80 B: um i mean i i i would say unless you like skiing or something you wouldn't like the cold weather especially outdoor activities 

259.06 264.66 A: i've never tried the skiing because i was always afraid that i would end up with a broken leg 

264.21 269.68 B: yeah or just everything broken [laughter] like in my case [laughter] 

269.42 276.07 A: no i like the warm weather i'm like you i like the walks and th- the cook outs and the picnics and the swimming and 

275.33 276.62 B: yeah 

276.37 278.01 A: you know things like that mhm mhm mm 

277.70 282.40 B: yeah this will be my first summer actually that i haven't um 

282.63 288.34 B: had the use of ah my parents' pool because they they recently moved to maine 

288.36 292.37 B: they used to live in the philadelphia area out in the suburbs and um 

292.63 296.37 B: wow it was it was so beautiful out there um 

296.57 301.70 B: quite a contrast between i would say where i live now which is in the city 

302.09 313.93 B: and out where they lived which is um almost i would say rural it's not even town it's kind of [mn] it you know it's it's out there a little bit so they had a huge backyard and um 

314.49 329.38 B: i well i i'm still a painter but i used to paint all the time especially um back when i was in college and i would go home for the summer and um i would take all my paints outside and just sit outside and paint the landscape paint what i saw 

329.27 330.78 B: or um 

330.82 341.08 B: just do some different things maybe if i wasn't painting directly from nature i would find um a photograph of um i did this whole series 

341.19 355.29 B: when i took a trip to ireland a few years ago and i did a whole photographic series and a whole sketch series and i took that outside and just just to be outside to get a tan and stuff like that and the weather was so nice and i would paint that stuff and ah 

351.57 352.89 A: (( oh yes mhm mhm )) 

355.86 359.15 B: um because i use oil paints 

360.57 366.78 B: the fumes kind of are overpowering if you are indoors like if you don't have a very well ventilated space 

366.91 370.59 B: so i didn't want to just like use my bedroom and have it smell like paint all the time 

370.82 376.88 B: so yeah that's one thing i miss because i don't have a backyard anymore it's just 

376.78 381.21 A: [mn] i bet you could get some beautiful ah paintings in maine in the summer time mhm 

380.59 391.57 B: ah yeah yeah i actually have um back when i used to vacation with my family um you know up until a few years ago i used to take my paints up there and um 

391.71 402.34 B: i'd be right on the coast i would set my um my easel up and it would be so windy and everything would blow away and i'd get paint all over me but i came up with a few fun things you know 

403.24 404.49 B: but 

405.93 408.78 A: do they do a lot of sailing in the summer time at maine 

408.52 409.99 B: (( um i )) 

410.44 417.57 B: think some people do i know my parents don't they they mostly like to take hikes and stuff like that um 

417.89 420.97 B: they don't do much of the the boating aspect 

421.83 425.80 A: i imagine they they have some beautiful trails in the summer time up there in maine [mn] 

425.38 428.55 B: they do yeah they are right um 

429.11 434.29 B: where they live it's the northern most coast of maine up um 

434.76 449.66 B: right like basically right on the border of canada so sometimes they'll take hikes from maine into canada [laughter] yeah and i mean it's it's so i mean it's so close by basically it's just that invisible line between maine and canada but they um 

440.79 442.05 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

450.01 456.28 B: they've gone to um campobello island um which is canadian i believe 

456.33 457.99 B: and um 

459.07 460.36 B: (( yeah so [mn] )) 

460.50 465.36 B: they are very outdoorsy nature people so i guess maybe that's where i got it from 

465.13 466.66 A: ah that could be 

466.18 474.15 B: yeah but they like cooler weather which is why they moved to maine in the first place um most people that i know of when they retire go down to florida 

473.69 474.82 A: yeah 

474.20 481.46 B: um and they just went the completely opposite direction and it's you know good for them if that's what they like 

481.15 486.67 A: well now me i like the warm weather i would much rather be w- warm all the time [laughter] 

483.07 483.90 B: (( ahah )) 

484.59 488.83 B: yeah now west virginia would you say that's um 

489.47 500.45 B: [mn] w- would that be any [mn] i'm trying to think of i know geographically where it is would that be um basically the same weather that you would get in philadelphia or um 

499.28 504.00 A: yes because we are like a hundred ah two hundred miles from pittsburgh 

503.85 504.88 B: oh okay 

504.61 510.69 A: it's where i live and whatever the pittsburgh weather is it's basically the same thing that we have here 

510.26 512.47 B: right right so you guys 

511.71 518.63 A: now today it's a little bit on the chilly side but it's not cold enough to wear a coat it's just been overcast 

517.99 519.26 B: right 

518.82 522.99 A: but in the summer time we get a lot of hot weather and very humid 

522.45 529.01 B: ah y- we do too yeah especially living in the city it's you know it gets really unbearable 

523.84 524.67 A: yeah 

529.15 530.30 B: um 

530.71 535.10 B: in the summer i'm mostly outdoors because my apartment i'm on the fourth floor 

535.24 536.51 B: and um 

536.93 539.76 B: as you can imagine it's sort of like um 

540.18 552.16 B: i don't know just like going up into your attic in the summer time that's that's what the weather's like in here there's windows only on um one side of my apartment so there's no cross ventilation 

543.07 544.29 A: (( oh yeah )) 

551.91 552.61 A: (( mm )) 

552.26 557.65 B: and um if the wind doesn't happen to be blowing in from the west i um 

557.92 563.97 B: it gets it gets pretty bad in here um at night i was using a um 

564.41 567.16 B: a window fan like an exhaust fan and 

567.54 578.72 B: but um i think now that i have a little bit of extra money i'm going to just have to break down and get an air conditioner because [laughter] any place that you can sit in the middle of the day 

574.07 575.13 A: mhm 

578.68 583.99 B: and not be able to breathe and just watch candles melt all by themselves without being lit 

582.63 585.02 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

584.12 585.83 B: (( you know it's warm )) 

585.53 587.46 A: that's warm very warm 

586.20 595.36 B: [laughter] i i have all these warped candles in my apartment to prove it [laughter] that that's how warm it gets it's just um almost inhumane 

595.06 599.68 A: [mn] now we have two great big maple trees in our front yard 

595.49 596.44 B: [laughter] 

599.06 599.95 B: (( ahah ))
