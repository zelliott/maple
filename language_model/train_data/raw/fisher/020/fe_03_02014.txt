1.84 2.84 A: hi 

4.31 5.58 B: hi 

6.20 6.98 A: [noise] 

7.08 8.62 A: hi my name's pam 

8.97 10.65 B: hey pam how's it going 

10.13 11.10 A: fine 

12.39 13.58 A: and what's your name 

12.68 13.48 B: (( i ah )) 

13.64 15.05 B: i'm jacob 

14.70 15.79 A: hi jacob 

16.64 18.80 A: so we're gonna discuss 

16.98 17.90 B: so 

19.37 20.93 A: government and the 

21.22 22.84 A: how they should deal with 

23.39 24.13 A: the 

25.10 28.84 A: shall we say crooks in the business world [laughter] 

28.25 32.69 B: crooks in the business world okay pam let's talk about it um 

32.85 40.79 B: [laughter] all righty so i mean yeah crooks in the business world i mean if guys make that much money there's no reason for them to be crooks you know 

40.94 42.01 B: so 

42.38 44.24 B: i don't think they should 

44.61 55.93 B: like do that stuff i think the government should crack down on them and like take all take all the money they steal and give it to their employees or something like that what do what do you think 

55.55 60.51 A: well the employees would probably be real thrilled [laughter] 

58.86 64.15 B: yeah i know i think i think rob the rich feed the poor you know like robin hood back in the day 

64.01 66.75 A: [laughter] 

66.81 81.07 A: well i'd definitely say they need to do something because you know like you say you look at enron and how that left definitely the employees thinking they had hundreds of thousands of dollars to retire and ended up with a lot of them nothing 

81.08 82.57 B: yeah 

82.59 90.63 A: so um i'm not sure what the government how they can do it except probably check things out a little better but you know 

91.12 92.10 A: um 

92.60 98.89 A: i'm sure with everybody anybody that's had money in the stock market um like for instance when m._c._i. 

99.16 101.99 A: filed bankruptcy i mean the stock market went 

102.35 104.52 A: terribly down and 

103.91 105.16 B: yeah 

104.54 107.26 A: lots of people lost money like that 

107.49 116.68 A: so i don't know i don't know how much the big corporations how much the government really even does or if they monitor them at all or what 

117.16 118.72 A: but i'd say they're gonna 

117.44 118.67 B: (( yeah i don't know )) 

119.53 124.28 A: no idea what they do there you know they always post the reports and everything but 

124.29 126.16 A: i don't know if the government really 

126.73 129.08 A: has anybody that checks into that or 

130.35 143.21 B: they probably they probably have a few people but i don't think they do too much they just like go visit in the corporations give them a tour or something like that i don't think the government really has like spies in corporations or anything like that really monitor them 

140.78 146.71 A: [laughter] no you're right i don't think they've had 

146.82 151.06 A: spies in there they might think they ought to now after everything that happened but ah 

150.12 152.34 B: (( you know yeah )) 

152.23 153.40 A: i don't know 

152.36 160.18 B: but um i don't know my parents work for exxon mobil and like my mom was telling me like the exxon like really was like 

155.86 156.72 A: (( mhm )) 

160.23 170.57 B: works on moral business and like after that whole enron thing they had a bunch of meetings like telling everybody like just be good and like don't mess up like enron did so 

163.28 164.15 A: uh-huh 

171.25 172.16 A: well 

171.36 172.40 B: um i 

172.54 176.55 B: think like it's really different corporations like act differently 

176.61 180.58 B: and it's kinda sad that that happens to so many people so 

180.66 181.84 A: i agree 

182.00 183.14 A: and ah of 

183.35 193.68 A: course what you're mom's saying if the if up at the head the company's telling everybody to do that and try to do the right thing they're definitely got to start up there to get some good leadership for sure 

190.06 191.40 B: yeah 

192.84 194.64 B: right 

194.50 200.88 A: because ah it did leave a lot of those people and especially i guess enron probably is the 

201.10 204.26 A: company we know the most about that people got ah 

204.27 205.59 A: got into it but 

205.94 206.87 A: um 

207.74 209.81 A: yeah it's got to be people's 

210.84 217.39 A: the way they look at things how they want to do business whether like you said earlier they're just out to line their pockets with money or whether they're 

217.76 218.69 A: in 

219.34 223.76 A: in for it really realizing how many people are going to be affected not just them 

223.82 224.78 B: (( yes )) 

224.92 226.01 A: and um 

226.54 228.43 A: but i'll say that 

228.87 233.16 A: it's definitely affected a lot of people and unfortunately 

233.62 236.57 A: um most of them in the negative 

236.99 238.11 A: (( and ah )) 

237.17 244.70 B: yeah i'm from houston actually where enron was based so like i like one of my friend's dad's worked for enron and he lost a lot of money and stuff so 

245.96 253.19 A: yeah i remember seeing some buy on one of the news shows twenty twenty or something and he had retired thinking he had 

254.37 265.83 A: oh i don't know i'm not sure whether it was a million dollars but anyway a tremendous amount of money he had bought this huge horse farm and all these horses and i think his payments were like ten thousand dollars a month and then 

265.89 267.92 A: by the time enron 

268.04 276.69 A: well all that came out i think his stock was worth maybe a thousand dollars and he was going to have to sell everything 'cause he couldn't even make the monthly payments 

276.68 277.86 B: yeah 

276.75 279.24 A: and he'd worked for them for a number of years 

279.92 281.38 B: mhm 

280.84 290.08 A: i guess the thing that aggravates me so about enron is that um even after all that then hear the guy that they were taking to court's flying in in a company jet 

290.53 297.19 A: so here the poor lowly employees have nothing but the ones still higher up that made all the money in the first place still have some of the 

291.05 292.69 B: yeah 

297.25 299.18 A: perks of the business so 

298.81 301.74 B: yeah that's pretty bad 

301.59 309.61 A: but i'd say that's but that's encourage that your mom said that her company's talked to everybody so it sounds like you know some of the companies may do 

309.71 311.35 A: start on their own 

311.72 321.50 B: yeah i i don't think the government has the power to really regulate these companies i think the companies have to like take it upon themselves and just learn from other companies' mistakes you know 

321.98 324.87 A: yeah i mean at some point you do have to take 

325.63 329.01 A: some blame and some thought and take responsibility 

329.07 330.36 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

329.10 330.77 A: for it that's for sure 

332.30 343.21 A: and ah 'cause i agree i don't think the government government's probably got enough people to do it enough money to do it time and effort and all that other stuff so i'd say a lot of the businesses and maybe 

343.75 345.90 A: i don't know have some kind of 

346.17 348.67 A: overseer type person that 

349.22 351.49 A: every now and then can just go in or 

351.67 354.82 A: you know kind of like the i._r._s. does the rest of us if 

355.73 361.29 A: our books or our taxes don't look right they just audit you [laughter] and do a check like 

359.44 361.02 B: uh-huh yeah yeah 

361.70 363.98 B: i mean that makes sense 

363.32 365.64 A: yeah do something like that 

365.65 366.55 A: um 

367.12 371.29 A: it has definitely affected the stock market and everything else any financial 

371.42 382.99 A: billings and even if you were you know like for instance um when i mentioned m._c._i. when i mean when they filed bankruptcy all of the companies that had anything to do with telecommunication 

383.01 389.63 A: whether they were innocent or not it didn't matter their stock went down and affected everybody like that too so it's 

386.92 388.02 B: yeah 

388.31 392.39 B: yeah 'cause people lose trust in those companies so 

390.94 391.92 A: mhm 

392.78 394.24 A: (( yeah and i and i think )) 

394.36 398.96 A: the government's not going to make people trust those companies again they're going to have to do that 

399.05 400.42 A: (( all by themselves )) 

400.13 403.08 B: yeah it just takes time a lot of it 

404.15 406.82 A: yep i agree but ah 

407.55 414.28 A: it does look like people are getting back in the stock market a little bit that seems to go up so hopefully maybe just um 

415.23 416.87 A: with companies 

417.09 422.18 A: taking a stand and i do know i can't remember now what it was the government did but it 

422.31 427.32 A: seems like several months ago um i heard them say they had passed 

427.93 432.07 A: something saying that if you had caught were caught 

432.26 441.41 A: overestimating your value or something like that there was a huge penalty so and they gave the companies you know like sixty days if you wanted to 

436.94 437.90 B: okay 

441.54 444.19 A: maybe change your information 

444.24 449.18 A: but after that anybody that did it or was found falsifying were gonna get a big penalty or 

444.43 445.70 B: mhm 

448.96 449.83 B: okay 

449.28 453.66 A: something and ah of course i didn't hear of any companies that came out and said their 

454.28 456.88 A: figures were incorrect but 

456.91 459.57 A: ah they kinda had a little grace period there and ah 

460.00 473.74 A: i'm sure that they realised the government is watching them maybe a little bit whereas before i think i mean really who would ever thought that i don't my brain doesn't work that way i wouldn't of thought about trying to falsify the price of something but 

473.72 475.10 B: yeah 

474.85 485.89 A: as with enron they said it went up so much that people should of realised it was just one of those too good to be trues but it kept going and for months and years so it you would think if it was false it 

483.71 484.61 B: uh-huh 

486.10 490.16 A: would of fallen after a little while but boy when it did fall it 

490.77 494.10 A: what is that saying the bigger they are the harder the fall but 

493.66 495.05 B: yeah 

494.70 498.21 A: oh i do i do sympathize with those employees that 

499.79 512.32 A: who had no choice and of course one thing the government has done now they've um i think that law has been passed that now you can only have a certain percentage of your money in the stock in the company that you work for 

512.16 514.57 B: okay yeah 

513.00 515.55 A: so that's one thing they changed um 

516.38 519.60 A: because like with enron everybody had their money in enron 

519.69 520.58 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

520.34 525.99 A: and ah so that's changed so that should help some i would think um 

527.25 533.38 A: so you know it's some little things they're doing but i i personally don't know anything that i'd recommend that they'd do to 

533.56 535.16 A: (( to make that change )) 

535.58 541.35 B: yeah i mean i think things will get better with time i mean i i have confidence in that i mean 

541.43 550.92 B: this i don't think will happen a lot i think people will learn and improve i mean still people are gonna make mistakes it's inevitable but i think everything's gonna be okay 

551.47 552.52 A: i agree 

553.23 554.68 A: i think people will 

555.31 558.51 A: generally most people are pretty trustworthy so they'll 

558.89 565.01 A: may stay out for a little while but then they'll think things are okay and they'll get back in and go for it again and ah 

563.41 566.65 B: mhm yep 

568.14 569.29 A: (( then if the )) 

570.22 573.69 A: if some if some of the new regulations the government's passed 

574.18 578.19 A: will probably work well and for those that don't 

578.80 586.07 A: um but hopefully there won't ever be another scandal like enron or even m._c._i. for that matter of course m._c._i.'s still doing business so 

585.87 586.76 B: yeah 

586.14 590.24 A: at least they weren't like enron that they totally 

591.43 598.63 A: went out of business and had to to sell everything so they're still operating and they still have some employees working so 

598.60 599.65 B: yeah 

598.89 599.89 A: theirs wasn't as
