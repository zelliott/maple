23.71 25.38 A: [laughter] really 

24.67 27.11 B: (( no it's about eight o'clock there isn't it )) 

26.78 30.64 A: [laughter] i guess it's all er relative 

28.44 29.51 B: (( [sigh] )) 

33.59 37.20 B: so we're discussing the business issues huh 

36.98 38.15 A: (( uh yes )) 

38.16 39.64 B: okay 

39.19 40.45 A: um 

40.92 42.74 A: let's see [laughter] 

42.46 45.51 B: i'm let you start [laughter] 

43.62 44.80 A: okay 

44.88 53.63 A: uh how can we uh prevent uh illegal activities in business i think was the first part of it 

54.65 55.69 B: (( mhm )) 

55.29 58.31 A: ah i'm going to say that um 

58.71 65.41 A: they need to the government needs to change the laws uh in regards to 

66.47 68.41 A: allowing the 

68.53 72.22 A: companies that audit um 

72.90 73.98 A: companies 

74.21 86.89 A: [mn] to not also work for the company in other words they should be independent and they should not be allowed to be paid by the same company that audit them s- audits them like worldcom 

87.83 93.66 B: well i think that they should screen the employees better 

94.55 96.83 B: and see if they have um 

97.55 98.52 B: (( you know )) 

98.78 109.24 B: dig deeper like test them for more drugs and any abuse like that before they hire them and then they won't be doing it in the workplace 

109.32 112.40 A: mhm that's a good idea [laughter] 

112.03 113.45 B: [laughter] 

114.40 117.89 B: well and they need to check them see if um 

119.03 121.57 B: if they have had any problems with 

121.65 126.64 B: taking money stealing money you know and [sigh] that way they won't be 

126.68 130.73 B: they won't be um embezzling money either so 

131.37 133.89 A: you know i found out the other day this is interesting 

133.99 136.62 A: a lot of the people that do the um 

137.36 138.40 A: uh 

138.56 143.24 A: customer service like you call a customer service number if you have a problem are actually in prison 

143.61 144.32 B: (( mm )) 

143.93 150.90 A: [laughter] that seems like an odd thing to allow prisoners to ge- have personal information on people like that 

150.31 151.82 B: yeah 

151.26 159.06 A: like if you call to order something like one of those infomercial deals often the person that takes the orders is actually a prisoner they are in prison 

155.22 156.33 B: mhm 

158.93 160.11 B: wow 

159.88 162.29 A: they farm out the um 

162.37 166.88 A: customer service so they have your credit card numbers and everything it's pretty scary 

166.15 167.26 B: (( shoo )) 

167.53 177.53 A: they should change that [laughter] i'm not so happy about uh some criminals having my address and phone number and [mn] uh credit card information 

168.72 170.16 B: (( i know )) 

177.42 178.88 B: me either 

178.41 179.94 A: yeah 

180.44 183.56 B: they they could put a stop to that too couldn't they 

182.66 189.94 A: [laughter] yeah that seems like it shouldn't really be legal but i guess it's like really it's a good deal for them because you know 

184.29 185.71 B: [laughter] 

189.58 192.03 B: do they get paid for it [laughter] 

191.27 193.10 A: yeah they get paid for it 

193.07 194.47 B: wow 

193.75 198.22 A: so and they have you know what else are they doing [laughter] 

198.41 200.98 B: [laughter] well that's true 

200.58 211.03 A: [laughter] plus i guess it's it's much cheaper for the employers because the companies pay out don't have to pay prisoners that much so you 

210.58 214.87 B: how do they know that the prisoner is not going to take our information and 

215.01 218.09 B: (( you know just huh go crazy with it )) 

217.34 227.54 A: see that's the problem i think some of them do actually that's what the story was about apparently some of them were actually writing down the credit card numbers 

221.72 222.47 B: (( mm )) 

227.86 229.13 A: and uh 

229.18 238.21 A: bringing them back to their cells and then they you know they're allowed to make phone calls so they were calling and ordering things [laughter] it's a little strange 

235.14 236.33 B: yeah 

238.85 243.15 A: they could cut that out [laughter] 

240.01 242.76 B: [laughter] that's true 

243.11 247.87 B: i mean you never know when the prisoner is going to call now [laughter] 

246.10 247.11 A: no 

247.16 249.87 A: hey i could be in prison [laughter] 

248.29 254.04 B: instead of calling a._t. and t. you know collect phone call [laughter] 

253.02 260.20 A: but you know that's the thing you really have no idea they should have you know what they should at least have to identify themselves as prisoners and 

259.57 261.01 B: yeah 

260.35 263.12 A: then if you didn't want to give them the information you wouldn't have to 

263.16 269.45 B: hello i'm an inmate i'm [laughter] [laughter] but i'm not so 

265.23 266.49 A: yeah uh-oh 

267.10 272.68 A: [laughter] you're supposed [laughter] well i'm not telling you my credit card information then 

271.68 275.47 B: [laughter] no i don't want it [laughter] 

274.85 282.53 A: [laughter] all right [laughter] uh let's see what else how has this affected us [laughter] 

281.91 283.28 B: oh man 

283.10 284.48 A: have you been affected 

283.33 285.67 B: the way the economy is now 

285.21 286.65 A: (( yeah )) 

286.36 290.23 B: i mean they do credit checks for everything you 

289.86 291.25 A: yeah that's true 

292.08 293.47 A: it's pretty crazy 

292.36 296.88 B: (( can hardly even go you can hardly even go to a doctor without having to do a credit check )) 

296.76 297.91 A: it's true 

298.48 301.00 B: and i think they need to cut back on that 

301.37 302.45 A: (( all right )) 

301.83 304.46 B: i think people would 

305.03 310.22 B: i think we could benefit more if they could raise the minimum wage 

310.74 313.60 B: and if they could cut back on taxes 

310.76 311.66 A: (( okay mm )) 

314.89 317.77 B: (( and if they would )) 

318.03 319.92 B: just um 

321.17 324.34 B: you know not have to check credit for everything you do 

324.59 331.98 B: i mean [mn] i can understand checking credit for uh what buying a house or buying a car 

332.26 341.27 B: but when you want to open uh like a checking account or savings account they have to check your background and i mean 

342.25 348.56 B: [sigh] that shouldn't have anything to do with um whether you can open a checking account or not you know [sigh] 

348.66 355.35 A: yeah i had them check my er credit the other day when i wanted a cup of coffee i thought that was a little too much [laughter] 

353.56 355.99 B: (( [laughter] )) 

355.70 357.73 A: [laughter] 

356.50 358.76 B: is starbucks getting that way now 

358.61 363.95 A: yeah they wanted three forms of i._d. and you know my last tax return [laughter] 

363.40 364.68 B: oh wow 

364.79 366.82 A: [laughter] i thought that was a little too much 

367.32 373.53 A: [laughter] i can't believe i'm getting paid to make jokes [laughter] uh 

370.56 371.66 B: yeah 

374.57 377.45 A: yeah i think um 

379.40 388.07 A: a lot of people have been affected that hold stocks because of these companies and a lot of people uh even people that don't hold stocks directly like if they have a 

388.38 388.94 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

388.79 403.49 A: retirement or a pension plan at their where they work a lot of times a good portion of the money of uh that's in those accounts is invested in the stock market and they don't even know really which stocks 

403.59 410.01 A: so a lot of people have had to actually go back to work because um their retirement funds have been depleted because of these 

410.25 411.49 A: companies 

412.05 412.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

412.62 419.48 A: misrepresenting the amount of money they make and then the stock dropping to almost nothing i don't think that's 

419.80 422.97 A: there should be more safeguards to protect people from 

423.51 427.81 A: fraud from the people from the reporting of income because 

427.99 430.39 A: it it affects the stock market and then 

430.48 435.89 A: it really can affect people especially people retirement people who are trying to live off of their 

436.37 438.43 A: savings or retirement funds 

438.32 439.57 B: mhm 

438.50 440.56 A: to have them lose 

440.76 450.40 A: not only their the interest that they are making to live off of but also the principal of of their uh the money is i think pretty criminal i think it should be much more 

450.44 459.36 A: there should be much stronger standards and also the people that are involved in that type of fraud should have [mn] should be punished [mn] more heavily than they are 

459.89 462.17 B: yeah i think so too 

461.89 465.56 A: yeah it's i don't know how those some of those people can sleep at night 

466.35 471.69 A: well they rip off not only are they ripping off their shareholders but the people that work for them 

470.90 472.27 B: (( [sigh] [mn] yeah )) 

472.68 477.68 A: it's it's those poor people that worked at er enron and worldcom and that owned stock 

477.76 480.19 A: th- th- that were sometimes 

480.40 490.76 A: heavily invested for their future [mn] in that way lost all of their income i mean that's uh that's like losing your retirement your entire retirement fund in one swoop 

491.60 494.90 A: that's horrible and they knew they were doing that 

494.13 496.97 B: yeah the economy's gone down i mean 

498.77 505.86 B: uh heh people losing their jobs and i know um 

501.31 503.02 A: yeah that's a problem too 

506.47 515.13 B: it's had a real major effect on people that have had jobs for with the same companies for over twenty or thirty years and 

514.36 515.14 A: (( mm )) 

515.27 520.74 B: they're having to um cut back on their hours and or just 

520.92 524.25 B: some even have to move because they can't afford to 

524.39 527.49 B: pay for rent or pay for the mortgage any more 

527.14 527.99 A: mm 

528.38 530.25 B: and um 

531.69 536.94 B: about stocks well [sigh] i personally don't have any but 

535.84 541.04 A: well that's good [laughter] you're lucky because this is a bad time to own stock 

541.34 545.15 A: [laughter] don't buy any [laughter] 

544.32 550.07 B: but the- these people that have stocks you know i don't know if they're really going to the right place 

550.50 553.30 B: that you don't know if they're really um 

550.54 551.10 A: (( [mn] )) 

553.49 558.78 B: growing or if they're being invested in someone's pocket you don't you never know 

559.20 560.98 A: no it's difficult to know 

561.18 565.85 A: and these guys if they're crooks there's [mn] pretty much not much you can do about it 

566.49 569.63 A: i mean after the fact it's too late 

566.50 567.36 B: (( yeah )) 

570.10 571.74 B: yeah that's true 

571.46 578.70 A: so that's why they need to be more accountable they shouldn't just be able to the problem is that they will hire they can hire their 

578.72 590.28 A: the people that audit them to make sure they're honest so they're paying the people what are they going to do come back and say well we think you're dishonest they want to keep their they want to keep getting paid er 

590.55 593.21 A: it doesn't make a whole lot of sense it 

592.91 593.66 B: no 

593.60 595.94 A: it has to be more independent 

595.56 599.95 B: they need to hire people that they know will work instead of just
