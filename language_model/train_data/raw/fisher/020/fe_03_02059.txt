389.00 395.95 A: you know i don't but they they do 'cause we have a oh a tremendous amount of people that come down here 

389.62 390.28 B: hm 

396.52 399.56 A: and that's the only recreation down here 

399.91 404.65 A: that and the boardwalk which um that's good for the kids the rides 

400.10 400.99 B: yeah 

404.95 407.58 A: but other than that there's not too many sports 

407.23 408.05 B: yeah 

408.04 413.56 A: at this point so what do you think you'll be doing in your future as far as sports when you get about thirty 

414.08 423.65 B: i don't know probably not much with with my husband and i's lifestyle my husband's an evangelist and we um he goes round and preaches at different churches and we sing together and i play piano for him 

423.42 424.45 A: oh 

423.89 430.67 B: and because of our lifestyle we're just we'll never know wh- where we'll be next we're not fixed i- in any place so 

430.41 433.39 A: oh okay so you constantly travel 

431.33 432.32 B: trying to 

433.31 440.52 B: pretty much pretty much every weekend we're somewhere and then we- we'll have quite a few weeks in the year where we're at one place for a week 

434.31 435.41 A: really 

440.33 442.94 A: mhm that must be pretty exciting 

442.45 444.28 B: it is it's a neat life 

443.78 453.87 A: yeah we do that in the summer um i think the last august i was down in merlin bishop mairs had his i think he's from tennessee isn't he 

454.12 455.46 A: or near there 

455.18 456.52 B: mhm

460.17 461.41 B: yeah 

460.71 468.96 A: so that was great and met a lot of different people there and that's like recreation for me you know once a year we go to a conference and stay a week 

468.88 470.21 B: yeah 

469.39 472.26 A: and that's basically recreation nowadays 

472.39 476.65 B: yeah that's one thing i'm concerned about for our kids when when we um 

476.86 480.59 B: since we're in it fulltime how am i gonna have activities for the kids 

480.24 481.33 A: mhm 

480.75 488.80 B: with as much as we're traveling it would be nice to have some sort of to you know every time we go to have some sort of open gym that sort of thing but 

487.69 490.12 A: right where they can run and play and 

489.37 490.48 B: right 

490.09 504.63 A: everything i know that's kinda hard because my son he doesn't there's not really too many things down here for him to do and since we uh since i keep him in church we're a church family um he doesn't get involved in other things like other kids do 

496.38 497.51 B: mhm 

504.23 505.10 B: yeah 

504.77 516.10 A: so it's really not mostly what he does is in the house or mostly schedule a trip to go to the zoo or something like that you know and they really don't get that much recreation in school 

512.44 513.26 B: yeah 

516.11 521.16 A: not nowadays i mean gym is like twenty minutes a week or something
