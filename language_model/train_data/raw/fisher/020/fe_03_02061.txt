0.60 2.39 A: hello i'm mary 

1.84 3.63 B: hi i'm meredith 

3.75 10.64 A: hi meredith um was the first part of the question do you like uh cold weather or in- or hot weather activities better 

10.74 17.64 B: um yeah i guess i like cold weather activities better because i'm initially from wisconsin so we don't really have a whole lot of warm weather 

17.68 18.77 B: what about you 

17.71 26.35 A: oh that's interesting i like cold weather activities better actually i'm from minnesota although i've lived in texas now for a long time but i like cold weather 

23.97 26.03 B: oh midwest 

26.85 27.65 A: pardon 

27.36 29.06 B: midwest yay 

28.70 30.94 A: uh from minnesota right 

30.00 31.36 B: yeah that's cool 

31.45 34.92 A: uh-huh um do you like indoor activities or outdoor better 

34.90 35.97 B: um 

36.49 37.62 B: (( [lipsmack] i guess )) 

37.88 40.41 B: i guess outdoor like i like flooding and stuff 

40.61 43.09 B: and um i like swimming inside so 

42.72 43.70 A: uh-huh 

44.18 44.86 B: wh- 

44.93 46.97 B: so what do you like better indoor or outdoor 

47.05 47.94 A: well 

48.04 60.44 A: truly i like outdoor but i don't like to get in the to have a lot of sun which of course is really hard in south texas but um i like to go actually i love to go on volks marches which i don't know if you're familiar with volks sporting 

53.70 54.65 B: uh-huh 

60.05 61.01 B: (( uh-uh )) 

60.60 70.99 A: they're they're um clubs that set up walks and they're usually either ten kilometer or twenty kilometer walks and they set them up in scenic places and it's just for the 

71.19 78.51 A: for the healthfulness and the pleasantness of going for walks together it's not you know for your raising money for something or anything 

78.51 90.64 A: and so i've gone on volks marches in well actually in northern mexico and in texas in different pretty places and i really like to do that just have to wear a hat and put lots of sunscreen on but uh 

89.56 92.18 B: yeah that's cool 

90.96 97.26 A: anyway yeah it's very very nice and of course and it's really a lot nicer in cool weather [laughter] too 

96.85 98.08 B: (( mhm )) 

97.33 98.11 A: (( um )) 

98.45 100.19 A: [lipsmack] and the heat um 

100.20 106.80 A: i had found one year that i hadn't been going on any volks marches for a while for a few months and then i went on one at the 

107.02 120.73 A: [lipsmack] i think i went with one of my friends around june and it was so hot and it just was really really u- unpleasant it's like you have to do it often to be you know walking like six miles or so at a time in order to be able to do it in the heat 

120.40 121.54 B: yeah 

120.74 123.66 A: otherwise it's just it just wears you down too much 

123.44 127.12 B: well i bet texas after minnesota is quite the heat difference 

126.53 133.59 A: yeah yeah um where you live is it is it hot tend to be hot or tend to be cooler or a little bit of each 

133.11 140.48 B: um [lipsmack] it tends to be cold for most of the year i'm like i'm from southern wisconsin but like right now i go to college in philadelphia 

140.39 141.30 A: uh-huh 

140.89 146.30 B: and that um that's a lot warmer than where i'm from so i mean like clearly not as warm as texas but 

146.34 155.56 A: right well i i guess philadelphia would have the the moderation of the sea breezes and the proximity to the ocean um i know um 

151.06 152.34 B: (( yeah )) 

155.69 159.45 A: is a lot like minnesota very very cold in the winter and 

158.83 160.09 B: yes 

159.56 162.70 A: and and pre- certainly warm in the summer um 

162.97 165.24 A: [lipsmack] although not not like texas 

164.82 175.13 B: yeah [laughter] i know but people always assume that like since it's the midwest that like it never ever gets warm and i'm like no in the summertime like we get we get summer weather like it's not like it's not warm then but 

175.04 185.51 A: yeah yeah i remember real hot days like i think you get days in the nineties but it seems like the nights are a little cooler though there's just a little more tendency for the nights to be 

179.44 180.52 B: yeah 

185.54 188.03 A: maybe in the sixties and pleasant 

187.57 188.54 B: uh-huh 

188.39 203.17 A: that's the difference from here like we're on a summer night you know my or a summer day might be a hundred and the night might be eighty four you know and so it just it just doesn't cool off as much and and and doing things in the heat um 

195.96 196.68 B: (( ooh )) 

203.73 209.49 A: well it's like you just have to get do it because there's really no option unless you stay in air conditioning 

209.06 214.93 B: yeah but oh that's so hard i'm like when it's so hot outside like you just don't wanna eat or do anything or ooh 

215.03 216.82 A: mhm mhm 

216.26 218.79 B: i don't think i could handle living in texas [laughter] 

218.64 227.70 A: uh-huh well it depends what other activities are there really available around philadelphia i mean like going to parks or concerts outside or things like that 

227.10 235.47 B: uh-huh um yeah i mean i don't get to experience that much 'cause like college takes up so much time but um i really like running outside like i'm on the track team so 

231.61 232.59 A: yeah 

235.14 236.78 A: (( mhm )) 

235.68 237.87 B: going for runs is nice and um 

238.07 241.98 B: i don't know it will be really nice to just like sit outside and study but [mn] [sigh] 

241.57 242.62 A: mhm 

243.53 252.30 A: yeah oh i bet it is and i bet you don't have fire ants either that's the only thing about texas and sitting outside you cannot get away from fire ants which um 

246.32 247.53 B: no 

252.51 255.21 A: is it just it just seems so 

255.46 261.19 A: unfair somehow that we have all these nasty little creatures because i don't know are you very familiar with fire ants 

256.58 257.97 B: [laughter] 

260.60 262.90 B: uh-uh what yeah i don't even know what they are 

261.65 262.38 A: they 

262.74 265.27 A: um i think they were imported from 

265.12 267.16 A: maybe brazil or somewhere 

266.98 280.48 A: and they're very aggressive little black ants um develop huge colonies and they attack you and they they just bite and bite and bite like they sort of flash at you and of course their little so this all this very tiny action but um 

280.42 292.80 A: it irritates the skin and then you get a pustule that forms and it really hurts it stings and some people are very allergic and even if you aren't the fire ants swarm so if you happen to step in a puddle they swarm all over you all of them do this 

292.49 293.60 B: (( oh [sigh] )) 

292.71 295.45 A: (( so like people can get very very um )) 

295.43 297.10 A: it can be very miserable 

296.40 298.15 B: (( ooh yeah )) 

297.00 299.83 A: and you have to always watch for them i mean 

299.69 313.42 A: i like i do not go out and sit on a blanket or or anything like that here because i just i can't stand them even though if you're not on a mound you're probably not gonna get more than a few bits but i'd rather not have any to tell the truth uh 

312.22 313.83 B: yeah 

313.78 323.27 A: but um i know in the north you can sit out and enjoy it and actually my daughter went to college in in massachusetts for a year and half so i really hoped she'd stay there but um 

323.23 334.90 A: just because it for a lot of reasons but i was would say well you're not gonna have fire ants and [laughter] and um my son was in connecticut so he um he was at a actually at a prep school so he got to enjoy the same 

327.51 328.92 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

334.87 340.86 A: outdoor benefits you know where he could sit down in the grass and not have those horrible little creatures coming 

337.99 339.30 B: (( yeah )) 

340.37 345.95 B: [laughter] yeah the east coast is like a i feel like it's a nice climate to live in like 

345.32 346.49 A: mhm 

346.20 349.14 B: mo- more moderate than the midwest so 

349.25 350.20 A: uh-huh 

349.27 360.03 B: i kind of like that like it's not like the extreme cold in the winter i mean like it's a little bit hotter in the summer but like not much worse than where i'm from so like it doesn't really i'm like hm this is kind of nice but 

352.50 353.47 A: uh-huh 

359.96 369.98 A: uh-huh well do um do you ski in the winter i can't remember if i the phone was a little uh distorted so i you said you liked to do something and i couldn't hear quite what it was a while ago 

369.64 372.77 B: oh yeah no i don't i don't ski i've never skied 

371.95 373.64 A: (( you don't ski uh-huh )) 

373.77 376.44 B: um yeah do you ski [laughter] 

375.82 386.74 A: well i tried it a few times and i really i wasn't very good i went down to those beginner slopes but i thought it was fun um but that was like way back when i was in right around the end of high school 

380.56 381.46 B: uh-huh 

386.34 387.40 B: yeah 

386.87 387.69 A: um 

387.77 391.21 A: [mn] and so no and i never did learn to water ski 

391.19 395.40 B: i know that looks like so much fun i always wanted to try that like 

393.69 394.83 A: mhm 

394.93 396.84 A: like very refreshing yeah 

396.12 401.53 B: yeah like i've been tubing and that was really fun and i'm like water skiing you can just stand up like that that seems 

401.87 410.75 B: even cooler but i don't know if i'll get the opportunity since this summer i'm going to alaska so i don't i don't feel like [laughter] there'll be a whole lot of water skiing 

403.36 404.36 A: uh-huh 

408.00 408.97 A: oh 

409.36 413.34 A: is it like for for some kind of work thing or school thing 

412.93 415.31 B: yeah i'm a linguistics major um 

415.04 415.85 A: uh-huh 

415.63 425.80 B: we get to go um [lipsmack] they set up an internship and i'm going to alaska and they're gonna pay me to do like linguistic research and work with the professor there so that's kinda cool 

425.72 431.29 A: oh that sounds really really interesting and and so i'm guessing that you probably go to upenn um 

431.38 436.92 B: uh actually i go to southmore it's a really tiny little art school it's like twenty minutes from upenn so 

433.27 436.24 A: oh okay uh-huh oh yeah i'm familiar with it 

436.71 438.89 A: uh-huh yeah it's um 

438.80 451.83 A: very select because i remember 'cause my dau- my daughter is um she graduated in two thousand and one and so i remember all those schools and they were sending information and learning about them and she actually chose smith but she wasn't happy there so 

447.36 448.32 B: uh-huh 

451.22 452.78 B: oh that's too bad 

452.00 456.28 A: like yeah she came back to texas now she's working right now and um 

456.38 457.94 A: but anyway um 

458.32 459.99 A: [lipsmack] but i was just thinking well 

460.51 471.22 A: upenn my daughter's the one who found this study she um i don't know she found it but anyway so she had started participating or had had one call i guess and then she told me about it so 

471.26 472.38 A: that's why 

471.98 478.44 B: yeah the [lipsmack] um linguistics department out here and they're like looking to make some extra money and i was like sure why not so [laughter] 

478.00 481.50 A: yeah yeah it's kind of fun and um 

481.96 487.35 A: [lipsmack] but like she said some for ten minutes so i of talking on a particular topic 

486.79 495.60 B: i know i know like the topic for the day is and you're like outdoor activities okay like what do i know about them not so much necessarily but like you're supposed to just 

488.14 488.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

496.55 500.64 B: and like it's kinda weird 'cause like it's you're talking to this person you've never met and like 

500.45 506.01 A: yeah yeah and i'm trying to think of things on the topic actually um 

505.89 509.97 A: i would say that here in texas in the hot months which is most of the months 

509.74 523.37 A: i really do do probably enjoy indoor more on average just because you can be more comfortable so like walking around in malls or um visiting friends and being indoors unless it's after dark when it's not quite as hot um i really 

521.21 523.95 B: yeah you don't have those ants or 

523.83 532.34 A: yeah right u. i really do in this climate prefer indoor most of the time except for when i'm out you know like going t- walking 

524.16 524.72 B: (( [sigh] )) 

532.02 534.75 B: uh-huh well those walks you do sound really fun 

534.84 536.98 A: mhm mhm yeah 

539.60 552.88 B: yeah uh do you know what like i don't know what they want like i don't know if they want like our actual information like on the topic like 'cause last time i've done one of these other phone calls and like it was a completely different topic and i i'm just really curious like what they ho- 

549.33 550.33 A: mhm 

551.02 551.86 A: uh-huh 

553.12 554.90 B: what they're studying like 

554.97 562.49 A: well i am too and i'm really curious as to why they want to know what kind of phone we're using and how we're using it and um 

563.18 566.32 A: and i even wondered if there might be a psychology aspect 

566.33 570.93 A: although i i i know it's fizzled into linguistics department so probably 

570.81 571.85 B: yeah 

571.27 582.27 A: there isn't a psychology aspect on it but i would think that this would be more interesting really for for a psychologist to study on like how to strangers in a kind of an odd situation 

582.04 583.09 B: (( yeah )) 

582.27 586.41 A: strike up a conversation and stay on one topic for ten minutes um 

586.67 587.52 A: uh 

586.68 591.99 B: yeah and like i don't i don't think that people really do 'cause you can't like you don't just 

591.54 599.89 A: no [laughter] it's it's a little harder this time i think the the other conversation i had was with a she was a motorcycle riding grandma from california
