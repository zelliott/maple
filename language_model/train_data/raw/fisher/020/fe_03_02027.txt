49.78 50.90 A: mhm 

50.52 52.26 B: (( i'm sorry i did want mean to cut you out )) 

51.48 53.51 A: no i wasn't i wasn't even saying anything 

53.63 55.42 B: um actually 

55.64 57.45 B: it's kinda funny um 

57.47 60.23 B: are are you by any chance one of the mystery shoppers 

60.21 61.50 A: (( mhm )) 

60.91 65.88 B: are you are you on the lists at all do you subscribe to lila's lounge 

65.90 72.97 A: yeah um i have visited there but i don't subscribe i don't get her i don't get a newsletter 

72.89 76.31 B: okay um well i just posted um 

76.47 79.98 B: something yesterday in fact my son is doing 

80.25 83.51 B: a class project he's in school for computer networking 

83.09 84.23 A: mhm 

83.60 90.09 B: and one of his finals he has to make a business application and he's making me a an access shopper database 

90.12 99.16 B: and so i you know posted it out there and asked for some feedback on it and i've gotten a real good response back he you know he wanted some input for his project and stuff 

99.08 107.33 B: and um i got real good feedback from it and i was talking to him about it he's thinking about turning it into a shareware product you know a real reasonably priced shareware 

107.44 112.98 B: and this kind of ties in to the the topic of the day because i you know i'm all of a sudden thinking 

113.09 121.68 B: okay well if you're gonna put a product out there you know you've got shareware and you have to worry about the people who are gonna you know just take it and use it and not be honest about it and i'm just going 

121.49 125.36 B: on and on and on and i had to stop myself and say wait a minute 

122.43 123.30 A: uh-huh 

125.17 137.36 B: no this is different group of people we're dealing with here we don't need to do this stuff you know they're they're they're honest business people and i caught myself thinking and i this is where it ties back into just 

129.51 130.60 A: yeah 

137.48 147.43 B: corporate scandal and stuff i caught myself thinking immediately that everybody is gonna just try to get something for nothing and screw the little guy and you know 

146.69 148.33 A: yeah 

147.97 156.34 B: and i guess you know even the huge companies are doing it and it just startled me that i stopped myself in my tracks so quick thinking 'cause normally i don't think that way 

156.17 157.59 A: right yeah 

156.46 161.71 B: you know and y- you know i guess that's a product of my environment 

162.40 166.94 A: well it's i think it's a part of everyone's environment it's a day to day 

167.04 181.83 A: it's everyone i mean you have to well i would i would say that for the majort- for the major part that um people are good [laughter] but it you know the the the saying you know it takes one apple to spoil the whole bunch is very true 

174.52 176.41 B: i agree i agree 

180.74 181.57 B: (( yeah )) 

181.99 191.85 B: and i guess when you think about it it's the small companies and the small businesses that are trying to be out there and be honest and make a living and but the new is cluttered with all these 

189.75 196.83 A: no no that isn't true [laughter] no the small business owner has to steal from himself just to make ends meet 

192.01 193.58 B: you don't think so [mn] 

196.77 201.99 B: well that's true but you know given they have the opportunity to make an honest living- 

203.40 206.18 B: [mn] what i'm saying what i meant to say is that 

204.11 211.15 A: [laughter] they do have the opportunity they just want to make more money so they have to steal from themselves [mn] 

210.21 217.96 B: that's true but i guess the point i was trying to make is that you know you turn on t. v. and you hear about all the big major corporate scandals 

217.32 219.04 A: right right 

218.02 221.36 B: that you know if it's starting at the top of the tree 

220.93 222.17 A: yeah 

221.53 226.62 B: you know getting to your point then yeah how can the bottom guy survive without doing it 

225.79 229.51 A: it you're exactly it's uh it's just uh- 

232.34 235.47 A: there's no way that you can't you can't get around it because 

236.17 239.30 A: the the larger corporate scandals and ah 

239.12 251.43 A: you know the money laundering and all of this is is um causing everybody else's pocketbooks to get tight because they're taking more than you know what i mean the money's not getting back into circulation the you know the wealth isn't being shared at all 

251.25 258.22 B: exactly but yet it's being passed on to the consumers and the the buyers and the the share holders and you know it 

255.82 258.16 A: right right 

258.37 270.19 B: it's getting passed on to everybody even in government i mean it just makes me sick that you know governments you expect them to i don't care what country it is or if they're you know democratic or what they are you expect them to operate 

262.27 263.33 A: yeah 

270.05 276.46 B: if a government can't operate at a particular standard who the hell can who the hell cares you know 

275.62 277.41 A: right right i know 

276.63 286.77 B: i mean we gotta get it from somewhere you know and that's too bad i grew up in a self-employed family and my father taught me from a very young age you know honest hard working 

278.68 279.93 A: yeah 

282.24 283.15 A: mhm 

286.61 295.49 B: um you know be good to your customers and they come back well he's sixty six and he wants to retire and he's so god damn broke he can't get out of business 

295.13 296.05 A: yeah 

295.47 310.00 B: and it's because he has spent his life being honest and yet he's got buddies that are just crooks and they're making money head over heels and he gets very disgusted he's thinking man i could be on a cruise boat but then he goes no i don't wanna be that kinda businessman 

302.42 304.26 A: right right i know 

309.68 310.56 A: right 

309.95 316.73 B: and he's broke you know he's actually living poverty level and he can't even retire because he he can't make his house payment 

316.41 320.99 A: right well i i do believe that what goes around comes around and 

317.03 317.99 B: it's 

321.50 322.50 B: (( so do i )) 

322.02 324.66 A: you know and eventually [sigh] you know 

324.53 328.77 B: you're just not gonna get rich doing it but i think you're a heck of a lot happier 

328.68 334.01 A: right well but but on the same token yeah it's a it's a trade off i mean 

329.22 330.38 B: personally 

334.07 342.33 A: [mn] i would i would see most of the people that are doing are you know are stealing from themselves or from their business that they work for or whatever 

342.06 342.98 B: mhm 

342.19 355.00 A: um have for the most part a a conscience and that they have to live with that on a day to day basis and the people that don't have a conscience eventually comes back like it has you know what i mean they're getting in trouble they're they're having to you know 

351.51 352.81 B: exactly 

355.66 357.95 A: they're being prosecuted and ah 

357.35 358.19 B: right 

358.53 361.06 A: you know what i mean in one way or another i mean you know it's 

361.08 373.68 A: happened it's happened with you know the major corporations they're getting you know prosecuted but they even the small businesses owners they're getting audited more they're having to you know come up with stuff for the i. r. s. and you know it's 

369.69 370.49 B: yep 

372.36 377.76 B: it's it's not above anybody as far as getting caught and prosecuted 

374.52 375.99 A: no it's not 

377.01 378.74 A: right right and 

377.77 389.12 B: but i would rather be poor and honest i really would than like you said the conscience you know and to live with that so what's a couple extra bucks gonna buy me when i have to know that i'm doing this 

381.31 382.62 A: (( yeah to what )) 

388.66 390.15 A: ((  )) 

389.70 390.79 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

391.07 393.29 A: (( to live with this right right )) 

391.08 392.15 B: (( right )) 

393.30 400.43 A: when it's not a matter of trying to ba- to basically meet the needs of your family and when it you know what i mean 

399.45 400.48 B: right 

400.55 404.20 A: to go over and beyond to live the high life [laughter] but 

400.92 401.79 B: right 

403.93 405.51 B: (( exactly )) 

404.94 406.76 A: [mn] it's definitely not worth it 

406.77 411.96 B: i i think our ah business is unique do you do this full-time or is this just a side thing 

411.70 414.36 A: it's just a side thing i'm a stay at home mom so 

414.28 415.47 B: (( are you okay )) 

414.70 415.94 A: yeah 

415.53 416.47 B: um 

416.65 429.06 B: i actually went from the corporate world to um stay at home mom now and this is what i'm doing so i've seen of seen both sides and i'll i'll take this one any day [laughter] you know it's 

423.69 424.62 A: mhm 

426.71 428.25 A: yeah yeah 

429.26 431.69 A: we're well we're self-employed we run 

431.96 435.07 A: um three restaurant slash bars 

435.45 436.63 A: and ah 

437.22 452.01 A: it [mn] in and so we know a lot of the local you know people in our area and i we're from a small town so we like my my uncle is the mayor i have you know relatives that are cops and you just you know what i mean you just 

442.83 443.65 B: okay 

448.23 449.61 B: oh whoa 

452.27 458.87 A: [mn] see it there's favoritism there's corruption and all effects of government and it's 

459.14 465.76 A: it's everywhere it's absolutely everywhere and it's not even- in some situations it's not even looked upon it's you know what i mean 

465.82 471.64 A: it's sometimes it's a matter of who you know that's the whole you know what i mean that's how you get where you're at 

470.63 472.60 B: that's the point yeah 

472.68 479.08 B: [mn] unfortunately it's become too mainstream in our society like listen it's not even looked upon it's just what you do 

478.77 487.50 A: right it's almost it's getting to the point where it's almost i mean in comparison to like a you know a family dynasty if you're not related then you're not in [laughter] 

479.18 479.99 B: and 

486.90 491.30 B: exactly and it's begin it's becoming accepted and it's 

491.31 494.08 A: right it's becoming the standard 

491.35 493.17 B: i think that's sad 

494.19 495.02 B: (( yeah )) 

494.20 501.63 A: and it is really unfortunate because there's a lot of people that maybe could make some positive changes that will never have the opportunity to do so 

496.24 497.01 B: (( yeah )) 

501.68 505.21 B: exactly exactly and have a lot to offer people 

504.86 508.75 A: right right and people that shouldn't be getting in there are 

508.62 522.17 A: are i mean i don't know if you are aware of this but ah and i don't even know what your it was but in some federal court it was ruled legal that when registering to vote you could use a park bench as your address 

522.17 529.94 A: i mean if you're homeless you can if you don't live in a house you can say right it is legal to register the vote that way 

525.69 526.90 B: really 

530.12 531.25 B: really 

530.64 534.07 A: mhm and i don't know if that came about 

534.11 537.80 A: you know exactly what brought that about but it was it had 

538.13 552.98 A: my first my first thought when i heard about that was that um they maybe did that when you know when like the mafia was bringing you know drunks in to vote and re-vote and stuff to get the people they wanted elected but um a federal court ruled on that 

547.03 548.01 B: yeah 

553.08 554.10 B: well 

554.52 558.51 B: i guess the way i think about it initially when you said that is 

558.58 570.16 B: in america it is our constitutional right to be able to vote so are they gonna tell us if we don't have a home we can't vote you know so it's somebody's you know lame brain lame brain let's just 

564.92 566.35 A: right right right 

570.04 576.07 B: reach for the stars on this one and make it so ridiculous just to prove that we're being constitutional 

575.70 576.94 A: right right 

576.61 578.01 B: you know what i mean 

577.67 582.94 A: right but i mean i was just kind of like hm you know what i mean i think you need to list um 

580.88 582.14 B: that is odd 

583.00 584.06 A: like a 

584.52 592.95 A: [mn] somewhere that you can be i mean really i mean are you i i guess if you're really able to be contacted at that park bench on a regular basis 

592.84 599.89 A: then i suppose it is your house but you know it would seem you know a little more ah appropriate maybe to list a a homeless shelter or a 

593.91 595.28 B: (( [laughter] )) 

599.32 599.95 B: exa-
