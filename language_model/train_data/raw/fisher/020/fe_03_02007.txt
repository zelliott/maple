21.62 22.87 B: and 

23.00 27.63 B: how has corporate america affected you 

27.96 30.29 B: and how has it affected 

28.18 29.14 A: yeah 

30.42 31.83 B: uh the economy 

33.73 34.69 A: okay 

34.38 35.86 B: interesting topic 

35.80 40.07 A: yeah my husband would be better at this because he pays attention to the stock market all the time 

37.38 39.61 B: [laughter] 

40.16 44.47 B: oh great well what's been your impression of uh 

43.67 48.00 A: i'm hold on i'm doing this this study thing i need to talk 

50.39 51.12 A: (( okay )) 

51.82 53.62 A: (( sit down please )) 

54.98 55.67 A: (( [noise] )) 

57.99 59.50 A: okay sorry 

58.91 60.01 B: that's okay 

59.95 60.91 A: um 

62.19 65.20 A: well the first thing that comes to mind to me is 

65.28 68.08 A: the uh scandals with enron 

68.47 73.12 A: and some of the big companies um fixing their books 

72.07 72.91 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

73.29 80.52 A: and i know that we had some actually my husband had bought some stock in a company a local um tech company called peregrine 

80.22 81.35 B: mhm 

80.65 81.78 A: (( or peregrine )) 

81.82 82.99 A: and um 

83.73 97.97 A: it was like a really fast rising company and it i just saw an article in the paper the other day where they well they did go bankrupt and then [sigh] the uh c._e._o. did admit to fraud and that he had 

91.09 91.81 B: oh 

98.10 102.60 A: basically cooked the books and you know claimed that they had bigger profits than they really did 

103.16 104.12 A: so 

103.76 108.15 B: well see that's what i don't understand about the whole thing i haven't followed it that closely 

108.31 112.36 B: but there are generally accepted accounting practices 

112.06 113.04 A: mhm 

112.59 117.86 B: every c._p._a. when you sit in accounting class this is what you are preached this is what they preach to you 

117.97 120.69 B: there's a way to keep the books period 

121.18 129.37 B: there's one way that is acceptable everything else is not acceptable fine so what happens when you get to corporate america there's a whole different set of books a 

129.63 131.40 B: whole different set of rules 

129.68 130.63 A: right 

131.25 134.21 A: i know what they were doing is that they were counting 

134.43 148.88 A: um they had like orders purchase orders that they had um [lipsmack] they had loans for and they had sold these loans and then they were counting these as incoming orders something to that effect i can't remember exactly how they did it but they really 

141.00 141.99 B: right 

148.84 150.42 A: kind of twisted things 

150.72 153.27 B: yeah it sounded like they were counting 

151.06 151.64 A: (( [mn] )) 

153.57 155.33 B: the expenses 

155.45 156.69 B: early 

156.72 157.53 A: yeah 

156.75 158.02 B: (( so that [mn] )) 

158.71 159.62 B: (( well )) 

159.69 163.58 B: that's absolutely against accounting practices 

163.23 165.79 A: are you very familiar with accounting practices 

165.18 166.89 B: well a little 

166.74 167.56 A: oh 

167.23 170.21 B: a little and what they were saying just did not 

170.52 176.03 B: make sense to me why they would even do that because it's not something you can bury it for a while 

175.73 176.73 A: (( [noise] right )) 

176.11 180.44 B: but at some point you have to do an audit especially when you're a major corporation 

180.23 181.05 A: right 

180.58 182.14 B: and it's going show 

182.75 184.99 B: but see then they got some of the 

185.00 187.65 B: big guns accounting firms to go along with this 

187.72 190.82 A: oh yeah what was the name of the um anderson 

190.87 192.27 B: anderson wasn't 

191.39 193.05 A: they went along with um enron 

192.41 193.24 B: yeah 

193.31 194.25 B: so 

194.98 198.76 B: like i said there's a whole different set of rules when you reach corporate america 

198.49 199.45 A: right 

198.80 202.23 B: i can understand wanting to make your stock holders happy 

202.45 205.98 B: but inflating the numbers for any reason 

206.59 209.38 B: is is just simply n- not ethical 

209.07 212.98 A: right and y- you know i know that er you probably heard this too the other big 

213.12 215.77 A: topic of uh interest with corporate 

215.92 217.79 A: um bookkeeping 

217.85 218.98 A: type uh 

219.32 220.81 A: subject is the 

221.66 226.68 A: offshore um headquarters you know where they are doing that to get 

222.77 223.65 B: (( oh yeah )) 

224.06 225.69 B: yes yes 

226.74 228.71 A: um the tax breaks 

229.36 232.62 B: i can understand tax breaks th- they need them 

232.70 238.83 B: i can understand finding loopholes but you still have to stay on the side of 

234.94 235.89 A: (( [noise] right )) 

239.03 242.77 B: ethics y- you have to do it the right way you can't just 

242.93 251.61 B: well we want to show this so we've gotta you know they they're starting with the number they want to show and they're getting creative on how to get to that number 

251.34 252.59 A: right 

252.06 253.53 B: and it's wrong 

253.55 256.20 B: and the way it has hurt people 

256.27 264.13 B: i mean you have people who are not involved who lost their jobs who and we already have a problem with jobs in america 

263.99 265.82 A: (( oh yeah )) 

264.75 267.94 B: so why do we need corporate america making it worse 

268.89 272.84 B: and now what the president can do to stop that i don't know 

273.10 277.00 A: i know [laughter] it's it's like way over my head but um 

277.56 278.47 A: (( you know )) 

278.75 280.75 A: i guess we as 

280.84 286.64 A: the average citizen or uh people who actually pay attention to current events i guess could um 

286.92 287.85 A: you know 

288.30 291.58 A: write to their congressman or their representatives or whatever 

291.05 292.25 B: right 

291.71 295.74 A: you know is from their state that is their voice in government 

295.82 297.80 A: and basically let them know 

297.90 299.95 A: what our thoughts are and you know 

300.21 301.90 A: what can you do about this 

301.30 302.72 B: but how 

303.02 315.75 B: when that's that's well and good i mi- understand the letter writing campaigns and the phone campaigns to your congressman and your senator and all that but when they're standing on the floor are they really voting our conscience 

315.77 320.85 B: they'll say i'm going to vote the consensus of my people but we don't know what that is 

320.40 321.26 A: (( i know )) 

321.27 327.56 A: you really i mean you'd really have to put a lot of time and energy into following like [sigh] 

324.92 326.01 B: yes you do 

326.75 329.79 B: and the average american is not going to do that 

328.59 333.25 A: well because you can't you don't have time and and i think that the politicians know that 

332.79 333.82 B: sure they do 

333.33 337.63 A: and they basically go where the money is i mean 

337.10 338.29 B: exactly 

337.68 351.90 A: the lobbyists who you know the big companies who fund their campaigns and give them all the perks and all that and how they you know they i mean i don't think that there is any solution to make it um 

342.18 343.16 B: mhm 

344.08 345.11 B: mhm 

352.15 357.02 A: you know up you know open up i mean i think that that's impossible 

356.90 358.96 B: i think it pretty much is it 

359.14 362.98 B: a friend of mine just a few minutes ago and i were talking on the phone 

363.13 370.14 B: and we said you know society has just the time is just speeding up everything is so fast now 

370.19 373.21 B: and i think everybody is actually afraid to put on the breaks 

373.84 378.32 B: and it it's not just corporate america it's every aspect of our lifestyle 

377.93 378.88 A: (( oh right )) 

378.49 381.99 B: nobody wants to stop and look at the problem any more 

382.06 383.15 A: yeah i agree 

382.36 386.12 B: i i guess they kind of figure if we keep running we can outrun it 

386.50 388.66 B: but it's it's only getting worse 

388.46 389.81 A: yeah that's interesting 

390.37 391.61 B: you know and 

391.78 394.48 B: the only experience i've had with 

395.21 399.11 B: all the results of enron is sort of the trickle down companies those 

399.15 403.40 B: the feeder companies because i was working during that time [mn] 

403.58 405.41 B: at the state employment office 

405.35 406.75 A: oh 

406.21 407.96 B: and i saw 

408.84 415.57 B: oh my well it started back with uh nine eleven a lot of companies fell apart we know that 

415.16 416.04 A: right 

415.75 420.96 B: and then the trickle down effect is the smaller companies can't afford to operate any more 

420.97 432.07 A: well [mn] i know exactly what you're saying because i experienced that first hand my husband works for a family business that um they put on corporate events like when like microsoft was in town 

427.20 427.85 B: mhm 

432.68 447.05 A: you know they're at a hotel and they have the ballroom you know reserved and my husband's company he's the manager there and his sister and um her husband own it but he uh manages the technicians' audio visual text and he set up the computer equipment and the projectors and what have you 

444.87 445.89 B: mhm 

446.82 447.70 B: right 

447.00 458.33 A: and you know these were big money events companies have tonnes of money to throw into these types of events oh we saw a huge huge drop in what people were willing to spend 

451.48 452.24 B: (( yeah )) 

452.51 453.46 B: yes 

457.84 459.05 B: absolutely 

458.40 467.05 A: after nine eleven so i mean i mean companies that you wouldn't you wouldn't even know about or even know exist are affected by this 

459.30 460.45 B: absolutely 

467.06 469.20 A: you know such as my husband's company 

468.83 471.71 B: yeah exactly i saw 

472.01 478.84 B: guys fifty years old which is young in today's society fifty years old who were 

475.19 476.11 A: mhm 

479.05 488.62 B: they used to be called the whiz kids because they were the computer geniuses of the early seventies and eighties these guys are being left uh being dropped from their companies 

488.83 490.07 A: (( yeah that's amazing )) 

489.48 495.76 B: they're being terminated because they're too old because they have a new crop of of boy wonders coming in 

491.92 492.94 A: yeah 

495.89 499.67 B: and they're like what do i do now this is all i've done all my life 

500.41 506.16 B: and i there was one guy who stood there in front of me and he was so upset he was trembling 

503.27 503.95 A: (( gosh [cough] )) 

506.12 507.43 A: (( ooh )) 

507.11 512.76 B: and i went to my supervisors because i was kind of afraid of what he might do he seemed so fragile 

512.37 513.59 A: (( yeah you never know )) 

513.12 514.98 B: and i said um 

515.19 518.24 B: help me find something for him 

518.49 522.69 B: and the only thing that they could recommend to me right then 

522.83 527.36 B: was seven dollars an hour at u- at u._p._s. 

527.59 528.39 A: (( oh )) 

527.76 532.86 B: hoisting boxes i said this man has worked with his brain all his life 

532.99 535.27 B: and that's a slap in the face 

535.80 537.97 B: you you can't take someone from 

538.34 540.31 B: the kind of work he's been doing 

540.05 540.86 A: (( my god oh )) 

540.35 543.00 B: and tell him to put these boxes on the truck 

543.16 544.62 A: (( my god no oh wow )) 

544.67 548.05 B: his lifestyle is not set on seven dollars an hour 

548.61 550.10 B: that's ridiculous 

549.68 550.66 A: right 

550.29 552.03 B: but that's all that was there 

553.02 553.95 A: wow 

553.71 558.86 B: so the one of the big bosses came out and talked to him and i don't know what happened after that but 

559.67 560.85 B: all of this 

561.35 566.89 B: you know the the enron the nine eleven the whole thing the state of our economy right now 

567.25 568.90 B: it's so fragile 

569.00 569.85 A: right 

569.60 574.71 B: you know we may be a superpower to the rest of the world but internally we're hurting here 

574.80 581.31 A: oh i know and you know i'm thinking about all the money that was invested in this war and you know 

581.76 586.49 A: doesn't the money run out some time [mn] how do we do we have an endless supply of money 

584.41 595.00 B: exactly how do you how do you how do you say there's a deficit and suddenly you have two billion dollars for a war and i don't know the exact number i'm just throwing a number out there 

594.94 596.22 A: probably more 

595.06 597.46 B: how do you how do you do that 

597.62 599.89 A: i don't know i just wonder you know what hap-
