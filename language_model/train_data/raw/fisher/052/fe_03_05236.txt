113.94 116.31 B: i don't know it's just something 

115.91 117.37 A: it's really gross

126.60 127.43 A: (( [cough] )) 

127.16 135.72 B: don't know i cut them i mean i chew them or i i do it so neatly that it looks like you know i don't even bite my nails

135.94 137.76 B: [laughter] but it wears your teeth 

138.12 144.97 B: and um i was a moderate coffee drinker for years and i've gotten off coffee and i switched to ah 

140.02 140.58 A: (( [cough] )) 

144.99 150.79 B: tea green tea and you know whatever black tea and um it's a big difference 

150.70 152.60 A: in terms of the stain or 

152.52 153.91 B: the what 

153.29 155.83 A: in terms of the stain to your teeth you mean or 

154.86 166.25 B: no tea has like only forty percent of the caffeine that coffee does and tea does not raise your cortisone levels in your body in other words your stress levels 

165.57 166.88 A: oh interesting 

166.03 174.54 B: so yes coffee has about two hundred different kinds of chemicals in it plus the overload of caffeine that causes you to stress out 

174.29 175.64 A: yeah 

175.00 182.23 B: so if you can if you switch to tea you'll lose between five and eight pounds and also you won't be stressed 

181.96 184.62 A: yeah i guess you just have to like tea 

185.29 187.56 B: um 

185.47 187.45 A: that could be an obstacle to 

187.94 189.43 A: [laughter]

194.15 195.83 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

194.58 204.60 B: but um yeah if you can occasionally switch the coffee with a cup of tea you know you can put milk in it and um you know just start switching over gradually 

201.84 203.39 A: yeah that's another thing i 

204.10 206.16 A: i can't do milk either 

206.01 208.56 B: (( uh-huh you put soy in it or something you know )) 

207.98 211.76 A: yeah yeah but soy in tea is kind of ee- 

211.93 214.19 A: kind of not the greatest 

214.19 215.41 B: mhm

217.26 218.56 A: (( no let me )) 

218.71 220.28 A: think about it i guess 

220.42 231.22 A: um i guess if it's like vanilla or something like that plain flavored milk's just got kinda actually you know what's nice um or probably what would be nice would be um 

224.37 225.44 B: uh-huh

239.46 240.71 B: yeah 

240.97 244.86 A: yeah i don't know it's crazy 

244.55 249.19 B: and ah what other personal habits do you have um mine are um

253.52 256.02 B: i overload on sugar and carbs 

255.29 256.90 A: oh yeah well

258.75 262.38 A: why not life is short 

262.50 265.62 A: i i don't know um 

266.53 268.11 A: i'm a little ah a 

269.57 271.98 A: little fascinated with 

272.09 286.81 A: on one hand the culture like the corporate culture of america is like eat more eat more shit america and especially like if you ever go to a dollar store you can see how like the poor in america eat 

286.36 291.79 B: yeah we're very overweight here and um because people are loading up on the sugar and carbs you know 

288.60 289.50 A: (( yeah )) 

291.42 296.68 A: but that's the thing on one side there's this one prong of the like 

297.56 299.44 A: industrial 

299.55 311.70 A: you know media complex thing be slim you know watch your carbs do all this and then on another one there's this one like pushing consumption pushing it pushing it pushing it so hard 

311.31 313.35 B: i know especially in the northern 

312.24 323.17 A: if you ever like had to sit through like twenty minutes of like nickelodeon you had no idea why you would totally know why like america's kids are fucking fat 

323.23 332.72 B: well anyways especially if you're in a northern city where you don't get very much sunshine in the winter time a lot of ah people let up on carbohydrates to make themselves feel better 

332.96 344.47 B: and it gives you a high it picks you up but see we're on the east coast here we have a good we have pretty good sunshine amounts even in the winter time and ah i mean the people are slimmer here 

334.58 335.51 A: yeah 

341.11 342.06 A: yeah 

344.49 345.39 B: (( you know ))

369.81 374.69 B: ah um i don't know that's really not part of the subject matter i don't 

373.78 387.75 A: well it's just because i'm in toronto and i don't know wh- i just i'm just curious as to whether or not the american media at all has reported and acknowledged that the government here has finally struck down the law against gay marriage 

375.78 376.60 B: (( know )) 

387.71 390.20 B: [laughter] oh they did they did do it up there 

389.60 395.24 A: yeah and i'm just wondering whether that's in the media at all or whether they're just afraid of even reporting it or 

394.81 401.77 B: um it might be in the ah you know the gay newspaper here but i haven't seen it i know they were talking about it up there you know 

399.16 400.11 A: wow 

400.71 405.72 A: it's like it's you know first news article kind of thing here right 

405.19 406.57 B: have they struck it down 

406.74 416.18 A: ah well th- the the actual federal government is still trying to decide whether or not they're going to step into it and like prevent it because there's been like kind of a 

416.12 428.24 A: predic- predictable outcry from the religious right here but right now there's actually there have been like i think a hundred and twenty marriages marriage ceremonies that have gone on in 

428.45 439.36 A: in ontario in the last forty eight hours by people now that it's like you know if they can't take it even if they ruled back the law they can't take away the marriage licenses that were like given in that time 

438.82 443.71 B: yeah so do you have any more bad habits we gotta stick to the subject 

441.44 443.06 A: (( yes i do )) 

443.64 448.74 A: i totally do um [cough] do they like take away the money if you stray from the subject 

448.43 449.95 B: i don't know 

449.75 456.37 A: that's a good that's a good question i mean like what happens if you just start kind of like triangulating on ah 

456.40 464.24 A: some weird you know kind of apocryphal subject bad bad habits i think um going on tangents 

459.98 461.36 B: yeah 

463.87 465.57 B: mhm 

464.33 467.88 A: in conversations is a particularly annoying habit of mine 

468.02 470.22 B: oh really going off the subject or 

469.97 472.98 A: yeah and also just interrupting people when they talk 

472.71 474.09 B: yeah 

473.30 476.81 A: but you probably might have noticed in the last five ten minutes 

476.47 480.13 B: well you might not not have gotten a lot of attention in your childhood 

479.54 482.95 A: no to the contrary i got way too much attention 

482.63 483.61 B: okay 

483.10 487.67 A: i was like a virtual only child my older brother was just a big loser 

486.80 488.41 B: mhm 

487.90 488.88 A: so 

489.32 496.20 B: see that is that could be a bad habit interjecting in someone's conversation not being an affect- an affective listener 

495.99 497.11 A: yeah 

496.26 498.89 B: yeah that could be a bad habit 

498.65 501.66 A: yeah like my girlfriend makes great 

501.75 503.47 A: strides in trying 

503.80 510.64 A: to ah correct the habit but it's just one of those things i think it is kind of some kind of a power trip 

510.18 511.28 B: how old are you 

511.14 515.22 A: um shit i shouldn't have to think about this thirty two 

514.78 516.03 B: (( oh okay ))

519.82 521.17 A: (( late thirties are you )) 

520.88 527.33 B: but you should put some polish on it in your thirties that's when you polish it all up and by the time you're forty you know you should be good to go 

527.04 529.30 A: [laughter] no 

528.71 530.45 B: you sound a lot younger

558.05 559.15 A: yeah 

558.49 568.13 B: and you know once you hit your thirties you sort of put that behind you and a lot of people want to start settling down or they want to start getting serious about life or you know 

562.05 563.13 A: (( yeah )) 

567.71 573.22 A: yeah but i mean i'm watching my friends start to breed and stuff and it's a little off putting

585.99 592.14 A: it's just kind of ah i feel like a bystander a little bit you know [cough] 

589.54 590.90 B: (( uh-huh )) 

592.97 598.00 A: i feel that i harbor more resentment of them than they deserve 

597.54 599.95 B: oh because you're not like them in that respect
