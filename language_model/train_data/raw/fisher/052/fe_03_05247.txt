144.85 155.32 A: and it would you know be full of uh you know sodas all the time and i tried to cut back and 'cause like it's not that the caffeine it's not the caffeine or anything it's just that yeah 

145.00 146.59 B: (( yeah )) 

150.80 151.69 B: (( yeah )) 

153.17 155.70 B: it's just all the other stuff

228.92 229.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

230.33 231.25 A: (( they )) 

231.62 233.91 A: should've swooped the series a long time ago 

233.96 235.40 A: or yesterday 

234.32 241.49 B: both teams are so sucking it up like new jersey just watching the games it's so bad 

237.80 238.51 A: yeah 

241.40 242.67 A: yeah it is 

241.65 244.34 B: it's like both teams are playing horrid 

244.51 251.24 A: yeah i'm i i haven't had like ever since the uh i think the most interesting series was um 

251.28 252.48 A: the dallas one 

252.39 254.36 B: yeah 

253.80 258.44 A: and after that i really haven't had much interest i kinda like the uh the the first uh 

258.70 261.72 A: the first round with um san antonio and the sun 

261.54 263.45 B: yeah 

262.46 264.36 A: 'cause i'm a i'm a sun's fan 

264.20 264.97 B: (( ah )) 

265.52 267.38 A: (( but uh apart from that it's boring i )) 

265.75 267.28 B: yeah they were it's 

267.45 269.31 A: (( find it just kinda boring )) 

267.75 273.94 B: surprising that the uh number eight team gave the number one a run for their money 

273.17 275.64 A: yeah yeah 

275.08 277.94 B: yeah but uh [mn] we 

278.30 280.25 B: should probably get back to the topic 

281.72 282.81 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

283.55 285.89 B: [laughter] it's a pretty bad topic but uh 

285.79 290.48 A: (( yeah i don't know how we're supposed to talk about this for ten minutes but [laughter] )) 

288.91 290.75 B: yeah 

290.86 293.18 A: (( but uh yeah i i don't know smoking )) 

293.64 297.47 A: causes the most harm i i guess 

297.70 308.51 B: yeah and then also there's like we've got laws that are trying to go in to to like ban smoking from all public pl- places 'cause you know it damages other people besides yourself 

308.51 314.86 B: just like the act of you doing it secondhand smoke other people get it done to them 

309.03 309.80 A: oh 

314.49 316.25 A: mhm 

315.35 324.93 B: yeah so they're sorta forced into it while everything else everyone's got a choice if they're gonna do it or not like you can choose not to exercise you can choose to drink caffeine 

321.33 322.30 A: yeah that's 

326.25 331.51 A: you can choose to smoke too but you know other people can't choose to not breathe secondhand smoke 

327.63 329.50 B: (( yeah )) 

330.48 338.10 B: yeah you can't not breathe yeah the only other one that uh i think really affects another person is if uh 

333.45 334.66 A: they they actually have 

338.73 343.88 B: like if you drink excessive alcohol or something you've got issues there 

344.69 345.90 A: yeah that's true 

346.13 353.01 B: like if you do excessive alcohol drinking then uh your issues can be spread on to others if you're an abusive alcoholic or 

353.81 356.63 B: all that and then that can ruin 

355.44 356.38 A: and uh 

356.93 358.59 B: other people's lives 

359.63 361.67 B: mainly their children 

359.91 361.66 A: and also second uh 

361.76 363.72 A: drunk uh drunken driving too 

363.13 364.85 B: yeah drunk driving too 

365.35 374.17 B: i knew a guy who was killed by a drunk driver yeah went to my school that was no good yeah 

368.71 370.30 A: (( mhm )) 

371.79 372.66 A: really 

374.57 380.03 B: yeah i don't know there's there's quite a few drunk drivers in san antonio 

380.31 382.58 A: oh there's a lot here too you know [laughter] 

381.78 384.13 B: yeah i imagine 

384.62 392.11 A: and i mean there's most of 'em are people that you know they've had just a little bit too much to drink but they think they can handle it 

389.95 392.90 B: yeah yeah 

392.14 395.07 A: either that or they're too lazy to call a cab or something but 

394.91 396.61 B: mhm 

397.99 399.79 B: or don't wanna leave their car there 

398.24 399.08 A: (( uh )) 

400.39 401.44 A: yeah 

400.50 403.22 B: there's a lotta stupid excuses 

404.52 407.05 B: and then uh usually that leads to 

407.22 408.63 B: tragedies 

409.03 409.93 A: mhm 

409.22 412.98 B: and they walk away from it yeah 

413.28 415.40 A: yeah and it's innocent people that get hurt 

415.27 416.82 B: yeah 

417.69 421.75 B: [laughter] i wonder how long we've been talking a couple 

423.79 424.56 B: (( of minutes ))
