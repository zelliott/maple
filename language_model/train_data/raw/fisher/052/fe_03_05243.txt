14.55 15.62 B: no 

15.39 17.79 A: okay the topic is 

17.42 19.79 B: gossiping smoking 

19.21 26.03 A: right which which is worse drinking smoking lack of exercise overeating 

20.66 21.47 B: right 

26.27 29.14 A: and i guess we could add our own if um 

28.61 30.50 B: mhm 

29.36 30.56 A: if we choose to 

30.55 31.37 B: okay 

30.62 32.52 A: [lipsmack] by the way have you done this before 

32.03 33.94 B: yeah i did it one time before 

33.45 35.15 A: this is my second time also 

34.97 35.80 B: okay 

35.68 36.63 A: okay 

36.31 40.03 B: um yeah the first time i talked about food so 

39.55 44.71 A: [lipsmack] i talked about illness the first time which would've been a side one to this but uh yeah 

41.13 41.97 B: oh 

43.42 44.26 B: uh-huh 

44.90 46.79 B: (( um hm )) 

46.97 48.09 B: so 

48.55 50.32 B: i guess 

51.07 51.97 B: i i 

52.25 57.30 B: overeating it has negatives but it also has positives so i think i could rule that one 

56.18 58.60 A: what are the positives to overeating 

58.25 61.78 B: um because food can taste good and be fun 

61.52 62.89 A: (( oh okay )) 

62.56 63.77 B: um 

63.18 70.08 A: well but you could say that about anything like over drinking can be fun to some people 

69.76 71.83 B: (( yeah but )) 

72.16 77.92 B: i suppose i suppose that's true i guess i guess i'm just not much of a drinker um i guess i'm more of an eater 

76.18 77.14 A: okay 

77.57 79.43 A: [laughter] okay 

78.13 79.27 B: um 

79.59 82.07 B: and but i mean like i guess 

81.29 85.36 A: but it does have consequences of overeating it does have consequences 

83.70 91.33 B: yeah it it does have consequences i guess they all have consequences it seems like the consequences of overeating wouldn't be as serious as some of the other ones so 

91.51 94.87 B: uh at least drinking too much can you know 

91.52 92.54 A: okay 

94.02 95.49 A: right 

95.55 97.34 B: make you die 

97.36 98.43 A: (( [laughter] )) 

97.46 103.19 B: and overeating can i guess make you die if you take it to an extreme but it's a much rarer extreme 

101.62 104.30 A: oh yeah high cholesterol and uh 

103.65 105.02 B: right 

104.42 106.76 A: all that stuff and uh [lipsmack] 

105.62 111.33 B: right but i mean it usually won't like bring you to a critical condition like in the short term 

111.29 112.23 A: okay 

112.00 113.21 B: um 

112.58 115.43 A: well what if you smoke just moderately let's say 

115.85 117.66 B: uh i 

116.67 129.56 A: that's the only one that's really not socially acceptable or less and less so these days as as you're probably aware in new york maybe in in cambridge and boston and also you you can't smoke in any restaurants or even in bars now 

119.62 120.59 B: yeah 

129.32 136.58 B: they actually just outlawed it in cambridge we were the only community a- around greater boston that had it legal and um 

135.76 136.93 A: in bars 

137.17 140.29 B: yeah uh i think it's in bars 

138.22 139.09 A: really 

139.67 141.43 A: mhm 

140.31 142.88 B: um in restaurants certainly 

142.83 143.73 A: mhm 

143.13 147.34 B: and um the city council just voted to make it illegal 

147.22 148.46 A: yeah 

147.91 149.79 B: um so it's 

149.38 155.41 A: yeah there's really it's not only a health stigma but uh a health consequence but also a social stigma to smoking 

150.45 151.06 B: (( [cough] )) 

152.02 152.93 B: right 

154.64 158.69 B: right i mean i've never smoked personally i mean so 

157.18 158.06 A: mhm 

158.98 165.55 B: i don't really see the upside i guess just personally um 

164.61 165.45 A: right 

165.62 166.94 B: and so 

166.72 173.21 A: but you know even people who don't smoke find it unreasonable that it's been banned in bars 

172.79 173.66 B: (( mm )) 

173.22 176.12 A: and [lipsmack] i do smoke by the way 

175.62 176.78 B: right 

176.15 177.42 A: (( although i'm i'm )) 

177.51 180.26 A: always thinking of quitting but 

178.90 182.79 B: yeah i i know i i mean i know a lotta people who 

182.87 185.76 B: have tried to quit and but it can be hard so 

184.13 185.16 A: mhm 

185.57 186.82 A: mhm 

186.23 187.36 B: um 

188.25 189.18 B: i don't know 

189.41 192.58 B: and then and then gossiping i guess 

191.62 194.08 A: [cough] i you know i didn't hear that on the list 

193.73 198.66 B: yeah that was on the list that was actually the the like i caught i think that was one of the first things 

195.03 195.93 A: yeah 

198.31 202.15 A: that kinda doesn't fit in the category with all the rest 

199.98 200.85 B: yeah 

201.84 204.30 B: it it doesn't really um 

204.32 207.46 B: i'm pretty sure that's what i heard um 

205.72 206.93 A: mhm 

207.67 210.80 A: that can certainly be uh very injurious 

210.58 212.71 B: it it can um 

211.59 212.41 A: mhm 

213.20 214.91 B: but i don't know 

213.82 215.79 A: in a different way [laughter] 

215.41 217.60 B: yeah i i guess 

217.91 219.11 B: um 

219.18 223.50 B: it's less hurting yourself a lotta time and more hurting other people 

221.62 222.56 A: okay 

222.96 223.95 A: okay 

223.57 224.71 B: um 

225.10 226.55 B: and so 

227.16 234.00 B: in a way that might make it one of the worst because you don't have like kind of a a disincentive to do it 

234.16 235.03 A: okay 

234.32 236.16 B: um on your own 

236.09 237.16 A: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

237.02 238.15 B: um 

240.51 254.02 B: [mn] i mean it's it's sort of all these things are kind of it's it's kind of hard to rate them they're they're not really they all have it's like comparing apples and oranges what 

247.75 248.83 A: yes 

250.89 255.85 A: well you you would need some criteria you would need some criteria to rate them 

254.66 256.46 B: you would um 

258.09 258.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

259.39 260.67 B: i guess 

261.13 263.11 B: causing harm 

263.34 264.36 A: okay 

263.86 272.59 B: and but like what kind of harm is the worst kind of harm i guess causing harm to people's health causing harm to people's emotional well being 

272.39 275.77 A: mhm which which can lead to causing harm to health 

272.70 274.37 B: but then that even that 

275.84 276.86 A: i think to 

276.18 278.58 B: right and but even then like 

276.91 277.84 A: people 

278.59 280.73 B: y- when you're talking about um 

282.88 290.04 B: causing harm to health like like what level is smoking are you comparing to what level of drinking you know i mean 

289.12 294.00 A: sure sure it depends on the amount and the uh the frequency and the uh 

291.23 292.40 B: right 

294.30 298.73 A: certainly i mean moderate drinking is certainly socially acceptable 

295.10 295.97 B: right 

298.08 303.81 B: absolutely and so it's hard to it's really i mean i guess 

298.81 299.96 A: and uh 

305.29 309.82 A: well there there are people who think that even one drink is harmful and and uh 

305.40 306.25 B: it 

310.12 311.72 A: (( you know so )) 

311.06 314.30 B: well it seems like we both agree that that's not the case 

313.25 314.65 A: yes okay 

314.88 316.08 B: um 

316.97 319.11 B: i mean i i really don't know 

319.12 321.32 B: what to make of this question i 

321.25 322.72 A: right 

322.71 323.88 B: um 

323.52 325.55 A: [lipsmack] yeah it's it's a bit of a tricky one 

325.23 326.57 B: mhm 

327.17 328.41 B: i guess 

329.41 330.83 A: well certainly 

329.60 334.26 B: any any the worst i guess the worst vice is something that will kill someone 

334.27 342.62 B: and so drinking will well drinking like you know gallons and gallons of alcohol in one night is probably about as 

334.37 335.31 A: okay 

342.63 348.24 B: bad as it gets on that list as you know well i guess eating until you explode would probably 

344.82 345.79 A: okay 

348.22 350.80 A: [laughter] i don't know if that's ever happened 

348.28 349.56 B: count there too 

350.20 353.32 B: yeah but i mean you know you know never know so 

352.69 359.41 A: yeah well okay so it's not like binge drinking can lead to can lead to immediate death is is that what you're saying 

356.20 357.00 B: right 

358.99 359.95 B: sure 

359.63 361.52 A: okay and and 

360.39 365.28 B: um so that's that's that's like a terrible vice i'm not sure if uh 

365.60 367.10 B: they were really 

367.15 369.82 B: if that really counts as one of them or 

368.84 371.92 A: but binge drinking oughta mhm 

370.18 372.87 B: yeah i mean 

372.41 372.97 A: (( [cough] )) 

374.50 377.28 B: the smoking smoking can um 

374.62 375.51 A: yeah 

378.20 382.73 B: have consequences for yourself and others like it's second hand smoke 

381.55 383.43 A: with second hand smoke 

382.85 387.92 B: but so can drinking it's like you know you you can like beat someone up or 

387.32 389.90 A: oh drinking and driving is the most common uh 

388.17 390.37 B: drunk driving what 

390.07 393.10 A: drinking and driving is the most common uh 

391.30 392.71 B: right right 

393.57 395.71 A: situation as far as hurting others 

395.15 397.61 B: right and then 

396.19 396.91 A: so 

398.57 402.75 B: i i think like i still think overeating seems like the most harmless 

403.04 404.04 A: mhm 

403.14 404.90 B: of of them so 

404.99 408.64 A: [lipsmack] how would you rate lack of exercise that was also one of them 

405.21 406.50 B: and i and i 

408.03 410.38 B: lack of exercise hm 

409.57 410.80 A: mhm 

410.76 412.19 B: um 

413.32 417.52 B: again i don't think it can hurt other people so it's it's sort of 

417.26 419.01 A: right 

418.20 420.80 B: and and i mean 

421.21 424.23 A: so you would put that a- about on the same level as 

423.97 425.39 B: overeating i guess 

424.36 425.60 A: overeating 

425.40 427.51 B: except that i i i wouldn't 

426.66 430.04 A: although in combination they [laughter] could a synergistic effect and uh 

429.17 435.32 B: right except that i i'm not sure if i would put it with overeating 'cause overeating again can be pleasurable 

434.91 439.23 A: and what is what what is what is overeating exactly 

438.64 439.90 B: um 

439.41 442.16 A: what what does that even mean overeating 

440.84 443.87 B: well i guess what i do too much of um 

442.74 443.67 A: [laughter] 

444.18 447.74 B: you know just eating when you're not hungry 

445.91 448.05 A: you have a personal perspective on it 

447.93 448.80 B: what 

448.45 450.83 A: you have a personal perspective on it 

450.23 454.73 B: yeah i i guess uh i guess eating when you're not hungry maybe eating too 

450.91 451.69 A: mhm 

453.77 455.52 A: can i ask you a personal question 

455.12 455.95 B: sure 

455.74 457.02 A: (( are you overweight )) 

457.02 459.05 B: yep somewhat 

457.79 458.77 A: okay 

459.01 460.76 A: how do you feel about being overweight 

460.66 462.13 B: uh it's 

462.24 463.67 A: are you yeah 

463.04 466.63 B: i mean i would obviously prefer not to be but 

466.02 471.20 A: mhm but the pleasure of eating is too too is stronger than that 

466.88 467.82 B: like 

470.59 472.26 B: yeah i'd say so 

472.15 473.10 A: okay 

472.78 480.69 B: i mean i i don't think i'm that so much overweight that it terribly interferes with my life and i i 

479.91 480.83 A: okay 

480.71 485.90 B: mean like i guess i would 

486.08 493.06 B: i if i would the uh the ultimate state of being would be to have 

492.83 501.87 B: sort of the self control to you know be happy and have without you know succumbing to all these temptations and i think that would be a 

500.25 504.80 A: so so you eat when you're not hungry is that what you were saying before 

502.81 503.82 B: yeah 

504.33 505.60 B: yeah 

505.44 508.30 A: because you you it's just pleasurable 

507.87 509.34 B: right 

508.87 509.91 A: okay 

510.16 514.57 B: i mean i guess that would be like my working definition of overeating maybe 

514.91 517.25 A: what to eat when you're not hungry 

516.85 518.70 B: yeah 

517.66 518.63 A: okay 

518.89 520.36 A: uh 

520.88 528.36 B: but i still enjoy it i enjoy the taste i enjoy like you know the texture the the sensation of chewing you know 

520.93 521.80 A: would you 

522.85 523.64 A: right 

527.80 532.32 A: are we talking about you know fine restaurants or are we talking about junk food 

532.42 534.69 B: um just food in general 

533.03 533.69 A: (( [cough] )) 

534.87 535.82 A: okay 

535.42 539.57 B: i mean if you're i mean in a way if you're going to eat when you're not hungry 

539.80 540.89 B: it's 

541.18 551.01 B: by definition you know hedonistic you know you're not doing it to feed yourself or keep yourself healthy you're doing it 'cause it's a pleasurable experience 

547.42 548.44 A: right 

550.69 552.28 A: mhm 

551.88 553.12 B: um 

554.00 555.03 B: so 

555.04 558.89 B: it like and and then 

558.93 564.88 B: i think sitting around and not exercising is sort of more 

565.02 567.90 B: a question of not having motivation or 

567.88 569.70 A: or feeling tired or whatever 

568.20 572.34 B: it's it's sort of it's uh it's a less happy way to be i guess 

571.69 572.63 A: okay 

573.02 574.24 B: um 

574.97 579.48 B: so i'd i'd put i'd put overeating as slightly better than 

579.84 580.94 B: um 

581.15 582.67 B: not exercising 

582.08 584.11 A: slightly less harmful 

583.57 591.55 B: yeah well better not less harmful whatever and and then i'd put smoking and drinking as 

584.32 585.21 A: okay 

586.49 587.34 A: mhm 

591.73 595.40 B: slightly worse than those because they can hurt other people 

595.42 596.47 A: mhm 

595.79 597.30 B: (( and )) 

596.70 597.67 A: (( [cough] )) 

598.19 599.89 B: i don't know what else
