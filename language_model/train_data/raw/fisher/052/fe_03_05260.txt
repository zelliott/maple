37.52 38.71 B: [mn] i see 

40.41 47.29 A: um some programs but that's only because people tell me about it or perhaps i might you know 

47.12 57.45 A: be really sleepy and be sitting on tele- on on the couch and just you know glancing at the images and somehow grasp something but for the most part um 

52.87 53.94 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

54.88 55.76 B: (( yeah )) 

57.85 59.81 A: i don't really watch 

58.25 58.84 B: (( yeah )) 

59.64 60.78 B: yeah 

60.94 63.75 A: um do you what what do you watch 

65.58 69.60 B: [sigh] you know uh there's some local shows that i watch uh 

69.93 74.90 B: there's this show called oregon art beat which just which features artists around the state 

74.84 75.82 A: right 

74.96 78.99 B: and and i occasionally watch the financial shows 

79.29 87.84 B: and news and little bits and pieces of saturday night live and that's about it i'm not much of a t. v. watcher 

87.76 92.27 A: um do you get a lotta comment from people you know on reality shows i 

91.69 95.06 B: no i don't know anybody who attracts that stuff 

92.62 93.51 A: mean 

94.89 98.07 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

95.44 99.74 B: i'm in a no it's like not part of my world [laughter] 

99.45 108.87 A: right no most certainly i mean out here in texas well i think across the united states and across most of the world people are definitely getting hooked on to reality shows in a certain 

108.91 110.09 A: sense 

110.38 112.32 A: and i think that's because 

112.34 117.86 A: of a great want for knowing what it might be like in a situation where 

117.91 121.23 A: they could never possibly be in to begin with 

121.28 128.10 A: and therefore they really have no concept on what they would do should they ever be in the situation that they would never be in 

128.12 129.06 B: yeah 

128.46 132.18 A: and thereby entertaining a fantasy of theirs which uh 

132.42 136.74 A: i suppose is just a thrill ride something like going on a roller coaster for some people 

137.09 140.26 B: yeah i think that's right it's a thrill thing 

140.99 144.52 A: and i the way i see it is is a lotta times 

144.64 145.53 A: uh 

145.74 148.05 A: there is very little 

148.40 149.86 A: well there's there's 

148.43 149.21 B: (( you )) 

149.96 157.86 A: more and more or there's less and less truth in many of the shows than it was when it did start out 

158.58 162.60 A: just so that it increases the fantasy value of it 

161.80 162.73 B: know 

162.92 167.38 B: yeah so so it's misnamed reality t. v. it's not 

167.01 176.79 A: e- exactly uh they're they're it's getting more and more away from reality than like the original survivor was at least something you could 

176.65 185.28 A: conceptualize like yeah okay fine they do have islands out there where you know you could actually see this situation 

186.16 191.38 A: but everything following that has really been more of an extreme fantasy than anything else 

191.05 193.73 B: yeah yeah yeah i agree with you there 

194.15 195.25 A: but um 

195.25 208.01 A: um from from the television network's perspective you know it's it's a great business but i i think there's also shows and what society's looking for that has been ignored greatly which is that um 

207.91 214.68 A: there's a void in in people's imagination which has resulted in this 

215.42 217.88 A: and the void being that um 

218.57 221.77 A: kids growing up nowadays have been 

221.87 233.73 A: have been introduced to a certain level of numbness in in in imagination which has translated into growing up expecting a certain norm and when that norm gets too boring uh 

233.84 239.31 A: something has to fill up the the void and in our age and our generation it seems to be reality shows [laughter] 

240.70 243.39 B: (( so [cough] well that's a plausible theory )) 

245.27 248.22 A: uh it's a big theory that's all [laughter] 

247.57 253.07 B: um yeah i don't know i just there's not a lot i can comment about them because i think that there's 

253.35 259.25 B: there's not a lotta substance to them you know that's all i can say is there's not a lotta substance to them and there's 

259.40 265.23 B: it seems like it's dreamed up it's far from reality it's just it's fantasy it's 

265.53 271.79 B: somebody's trying to think of what's the grossest thing that you can watch or what's the most daring thing it's 

270.19 273.45 A: oh no question no question about that um 

273.68 279.60 A: they they have that show on t. v. called reality factor or whatever fear factor or whatever i mean 

278.76 280.09 B: fear factor 

279.76 281.67 A: it it it really has 

281.72 283.28 A: no real 

283.89 286.31 A: uh it doesn't make any sense i mean 

286.42 294.95 A: why would anybody want to put themselves through that it's not so much about fear as it is about disgust and there's a big difference in those two feelings 

295.16 296.80 B: (( yeah uh-huh yeah it's )) 

295.49 296.55 A: um 

297.04 301.42 B: well they they they spice it with money you know they put 

300.63 308.24 A: well no of course everything is spiced with money i mean i think i would rather have a show that says you know um 

308.72 320.53 A: we will give you like a million dollars if which which team can challenge themselves to be the the most successful or which team can challenge themselves to come up with the most innovative concept to help 

320.63 322.23 A: some situation 

322.04 323.01 B: mhm 

322.38 325.07 A: you know and that that way 

325.47 334.33 A: at least there there appears to be some kind of a positive outcome i mean it's not just a tremendous waste of energy and time 

334.44 341.67 A: you're putting you're putting the people who participate to good use anyway you know and for the most part the people who participate tend to be younger 

341.72 346.21 A: uh in their late teens or mid to early twenties 

345.99 346.84 B: uh-huh 

346.98 347.99 A: um 

348.31 356.87 A: considering that these are the people who tend to be in the in the prime of their imagination and their uh their budding careers 

357.15 358.19 A: um 

358.37 363.75 A: i would think it would be beneficial to a lotta people if their creativity were ch- challenged uh channeled 

364.47 369.53 B: (( mhm no i agree with you yeah yeah i'm sort )) 

367.12 368.73 A: (( yeah )) 

369.85 375.06 B: of it's a sad commentary on our country if that's if that's what 

373.19 381.73 A: [laughter] well uh it's unfortunately it's it's not just our country it's just about everywhere if you looked around um 

382.29 386.94 A: other countries have a lot a greater degree of resistance to um 

386.91 393.24 A: american television programming but eventually it does get accepted and it does become normal there as well 

393.13 403.42 A: um i i think if you looked at television in the far east and in in south asia uh it's what american television was six years ago 

404.71 407.90 A: just exactly the same except in the local languages 

407.87 409.79 B: (( yeah i see is that where you're from )) 

409.67 411.57 A: um yeah i'm from south asia 

411.70 412.64 B: where 

412.07 413.68 A: uh uh india 

413.45 414.81 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

414.22 422.00 A: and um uh it's rather odd that um um that the programs that used to be on television 

422.06 434.62 A: before the opening up of the economy uh were boring just because there was there was no flair there was no marketing put into it but they were intelligent and that was the that was the problem with 

434.67 443.00 A: the old style of programming there but with the with the introduction of of uh uh western presentation wh- 

442.99 450.11 A: which is excellent um t- they haven't merged that original programming with the new 

449.98 459.49 A: uh presentation instead they've just moved on to the new presentation and the new material um thereby sacrificing a lotta good things they actually might've had 

459.62 460.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

460.47 461.32 B: (( yeah )) 

460.60 461.48 A: um 

462.48 463.05 B: (( [cough] )) 

463.25 469.45 A: but no i then again this is basically what i have come up with 

469.56 473.75 A: based on what i know of reality t. v. and not so much about what [laughter] i watched 

475.24 483.55 B: well like i say i've seen little bits and pieces and it all looks kinda trumped up and not uh not worth my time 

482.57 485.29 A: no no certainly not certainly not [lipsmack] 

485.48 486.42 A: um 

488.17 490.53 A: in fact i have not found 

490.94 495.14 A: any show on television that i find worth my time 

495.42 498.00 A: um except perhaps p. b. s. 

498.01 502.62 B: yeah no that's that's what i watch over here are you a student there in dallas 

502.65 506.17 A: um no actually i i'm working i have my own company 

506.14 506.87 B: (( oh )) 

506.99 511.64 A: um and and in a great sense i think my opinion 

511.83 519.14 A: on television and on television programming is influenced by the work i do and vice versa 

519.27 529.93 A: uh we we do human resources so you know it it goes right back into working with people and get- helping 'em get jobs but right away you have to deal with 

530.02 537.63 A: people and what they want and what they don't want and you can see a clear connection on how um 

537.70 538.74 A: various 

538.79 544.72 A: var- various inputs influence them television being one of the big inputs in people's thought processing 

544.12 546.52 B: mhm 

545.58 551.96 A: um therefore affecting expectations judgment and 

552.05 554.23 A: b- a basic concept of reality 

555.25 555.97 B: (( uh-huh )) 

557.28 558.13 A: um 

557.34 559.94 B: yeah i agree 

560.12 573.60 A: yeah and and um it's unfortunate but you know by the time people begin to accept our reality of today's economy today's situation and maximizing their potential the economy will improve and so they're gonna be behind the curve 

573.79 588.44 A: of um d- due to influences from sources which should not be influencing them in the manner in which they are getting influenced as in television to stay on television and purely as entertainment and not be 

588.73 591.31 A: helping you make decisions on your life 

591.60 592.73 B: (( yeah )) 

592.35 595.93 A: uh where some people actually use that kind of in- influence it's 

595.57 597.87 B: do they yeah i suppose that's true 

597.38 599.89 A: it's unconscious i think i don't think
