0.36 2.75 B: hey i'm joel filo 

3.29 5.66 A: my name's victor rodriguez 

5.57 7.01 B: hello nice to meet you rick 

7.03 8.36 A: nice to meet you too 

8.62 11.26 B: um this is my first time doing it do we just start talking 

11.21 16.77 A: man that's i don't know this is my first time too i don't actually uh i don't know what to do 

12.58 13.32 B: (( [mn] )) 

15.34 16.23 B: okay 

16.92 21.41 A: uh i guess you want to start the topic or you want me to start 

20.79 28.67 B: i i mean i guess i can start it it was about whether we want to eat at restaurants or at home and i'd have to go with a restaurant because you don't have to [laughter] clean up 

28.99 30.01 A: mm 

30.26 37.54 B: and i don't know my wife likes it better too 'cause i don't know she doesn't really like to cook and i don't really like to cook so i'd have to go with a restaurant 

30.68 31.24 A: (( [mn] )) 

38.34 51.84 A: yeah i'd have to agree with you i'd uh probably like eating at a restaurant more than i would at home but then there's nothing like eating at home because you already know what you're gonna have and and uh exactly what you how you can prepare 

52.22 56.37 A: but if anything i'd probably choose a restaurant over home too 

56.12 62.66 B: well i mean if it was like my mom's home cooking or something well my mom's not a great cook but [laughter] maybe if it was like 

61.10 62.40 A: [laughter] 

62.44 72.87 B: some- i don't know my dad cooks pretty well and so you know if it's someone else doing it but it's like a family meal then i'd probably say that i'd prefer that but uh 

72.91 78.22 B: i i don't really want to cook myself so i mean i'd say that's good 

78.39 88.57 B: [mn] i agree with you on that and then i gue- i guess the perfect meal would for me i mean i i really like south western food um 'cause i grew up in the south west so for me a perfect meal would probably be like 

88.50 102.85 B: um you know like some enchiladas and and chili rellenos and or having like family around and i don't know just good spicy food with you know like maybe some some good home made salsa or something 

102.74 105.65 A: mm yeah that sounds pretty good 

105.07 106.67 B: [laughter] 

106.01 107.15 A: um 

107.75 112.17 A: i guess my perfect meal would probably be 

112.78 114.86 A: something from the south 

115.27 119.26 A: um probably dealing with some gumbo or some jambalaya 

119.66 120.68 B: (( mm that sounds )) 

119.90 124.82 A: 'cause my grandmother was raised down there and i kind a grew up on southern food 

125.58 127.37 B: like with seafood and stuff in it 

127.20 135.50 A: yes um actually it's my grandmother actually makes one with seafood with crab shrimp um 

136.76 146.98 A: uh sausages and she also makes one with meat because my ma's actually allergic to seafood she makes it with chicken and 

144.31 145.11 B: (( oh )) 

147.81 148.94 A: um 

149.23 152.51 A: she makes it with uh c- certain sausages 

152.59 154.81 A: when she does the meat kind 

154.98 159.68 A: so it's it's kind a it's kind of a a a different taste 

159.57 171.18 B: yeah i've had gumbo like once or twice i mean [mn] there's some restaurant here i can't remember the name of it has louisiana style food um razzoos that's that's the name of it and uh i think i had some there but uh i 

159.82 161.03 A: when it comes 

170.51 171.40 A: (( to mm )) 

171.21 176.80 B: had some gator there too for the for for once it it was pretty good did you ever eat gator 

176.90 190.11 A: no i actually haven't tried gator i uh i haven't really i didn't know restaurants out here really served it i i mean i tried a restaurant over in the avenues and they served um 

190.12 194.21 A: um squid and octopus and 

194.35 197.58 A: frog legs and i was like wow 

195.37 196.59 B: [laughter] 

197.66 201.51 A: (( i didn't even know that there was restaurants that served that kind of cuisine )) 

201.17 208.93 B: yeah i've never i've never had frog legs before but but squid y- you can usually find at like italian places because they just call it calamari 

208.92 210.66 A: yeah 

209.07 211.47 B: and it's just like fried squid or 

211.48 212.83 B: i don't know about octopus 

211.62 212.90 A: frog leg 

213.36 216.25 A: frog legs would probably be something that you like chicken 

216.06 218.23 B: well yeah i mean i like chicken i like fried chicken 

217.53 224.64 A: well see if you like fried chicken you'd like frog it's it's it's nothing but a a smaller version of fried chicken i 

224.61 228.34 B: well gator's [laughter] like chicken too so [laughter] 

224.89 226.98 A: (( tell you it tastes the same )) 

228.04 229.07 A: (( mm )) 

228.55 242.32 B: they say everything tastes like chicken [mn] gator's kind of a little bit rubbery um it it really doesn't taste i mean you'd think it i don't know it'd be fierce or something [laughter] 'cause it's a big animal but it it just tastes kind a like a rubbery bland version of chicken 

242.68 243.43 A: mm 

242.76 243.66 B: (( so )) 

243.81 246.54 B: i don't know but that that was in uh dallas 

244.29 245.97 A: might be something i might try 

247.20 249.83 B: dallas has a bunch of restaurants like that 

250.22 260.54 A: yeah i i haven't i haven't really i didn't even um i haven't actually you are the first person i've ever spoken to that has actually had uh alligator 

260.43 266.98 B: [laughter] that's funny so so you grew up in louisiana they didn't really eat that kind of stuff or somewhere in the south i guess 

266.66 276.91 A: i i'm i'm i was born and raised in san- here in san francisco but [cough] my moth- my family are from down south i got a lot of family from down south 

270.15 271.44 B: oh okay 

276.23 277.29 B: (( i see )) 

276.74 281.79 A: i mean i if if they had they never told me that they ate alligator 

281.82 282.91 A: or they've never 

282.96 287.59 A: given a recipe for it to get let anybody try it but 

287.88 291.97 A: i mean i've i've seen cook shows that served it 

288.67 289.23 B: (( [mn] )) 

291.82 300.06 B: yeah i think it's just a novelty 'cause you couldn't really um eat it regularly it's not very easy to hunt [laughter] alligators i don't think i mean 

300.16 301.43 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

300.48 301.04 B: (( [mn] )) 

301.32 306.35 B: but uh yeah san francisco probably has good seafood i mean i'm here in texas so we uh 

306.63 308.50 B: we don't get it as much 

308.93 317.43 A: yeah we're out here we're pretty much yeah mainly seafood [mn] 'cause we got a lot of um crab 

317.46 318.85 A: crab um 

319.08 321.65 A: crab warehouses that do a lot of crabbing 

321.53 331.63 B: yeah i like crab i like stone stone crabs or whatever they ca- i like the the big ones yeah snow crabs that's it i i don't get it very often because it's expensive but i've had it a few times 

325.93 327.26 A: snow crabs 

331.92 335.86 B: it's better than lobster in my opinion i mean i just like the taste better 

332.21 333.98 A: yeah 

335.96 338.51 A: yeah and plus there's more of a portion 

338.32 341.14 B: yeah than a little [mn] more bang for your buck [laughter] 

341.07 342.57 A: yeah [laughter] 

342.85 347.36 B: but uh i guess you don't really get very good uh mexican food there do you or 

343.07 344.43 A: yeah 

347.08 353.22 A: actually yeah we do we actually have a a wide variety of mexican food here um 

352.04 353.95 B: i guess a big city would 

354.13 358.26 A: yeah we have uh we have a whole mission district 

358.25 359.26 B: wow 

358.62 370.71 A: that's just full of mexican restaurants i mean mexican restaurants they serve it every way you can think of because there's some portions down in the caribbean puerto rico mexico 

370.93 374.46 A: cuba there's all kind of different styles 

371.97 373.02 B: wow 

374.42 379.23 B: yeah i guess there are because i've had some like uh south american dishes before that didn't really 

374.71 375.43 A: so 

379.37 392.89 B: [mn] seem familiar to me you know it's not all the same i like you know real mexican or tex mex but you get into the like uh some of those central american type dishes or the plantains and stuff it's a little bit weird 

392.60 394.24 A: yeah 

393.44 395.30 B: but it's still good i 

395.84 399.06 B: mean so food it's making me hungry [laughter] actually 

398.77 400.24 A: [laughter] 

399.82 400.91 B: but uh 

401.64 407.14 B: anyway so i guess that's the perfect meal i don't know how much time has [laughter] passed 

406.98 411.72 A: i think it's supposed to be a ten minutes uh time schedule 

411.27 415.65 B: yeah i think they probably beep or something whatever when time is up 

414.38 416.15 A: yeah possibly 

416.10 421.01 B: so it must be uh what is it out oh it's earlier out there so have you had dinner out there yet 

421.22 424.70 A: uh yeah it's actually oh god what time is it 

425.36 426.86 B: i guess it's like 

425.74 428.96 A: yeah it's actually four minutes to nine out here 

429.61 431.29 A: so i mean 

430.37 431.74 B: yeah sure 

431.35 434.34 A: dinner was over like three hour- two hours ago 

434.29 441.26 B: yeah well i just ate like even though i just ate i'm still hungry though 'cause i have class 'til late at night and then we just go snack so 

441.62 442.65 A: mm 

441.63 445.20 B: now i'm thinking about real food instead of like a burger and it 

445.34 447.61 B: sounds like it a little bit better 

448.41 449.54 B: but 

449.16 450.86 A: how is um 

451.01 454.68 A: my grandmother is actually from uh houston texas 

454.33 455.96 B: yeah that's right near me 

454.90 460.28 A: and yeah i mean is is uh dining down there 

461.10 467.17 A: like how is it 'cause i've never been uh i mean i've always wanted to go um i want to hear from another person 

465.02 470.48 B: well you you drive i mean you you drive every place there's a lot of big chains um 

470.54 475.52 B: [mn] seems like texas and the whole southern area on the same restaurants over and over 

475.49 480.43 B: um a a lot different from san francisco i've visited there and you can actually get around without a car 

480.37 485.85 B: and the dining seems a little more upscale and expensive uh houston and dallas and around here 

485.77 500.59 B: um you there's a lot of places you can go for less than ten bucks um you could spend a lot of money um but most of the restaurants are like i don't know if you've ever heard of like fridays or outback or um some of these standard chains there's just a ton of them um 

496.75 497.82 A: mm mhm 

500.59 512.89 B: and i think a lot of people go out to eat i know dallas supposedly has like the most restaurants per capita and houston is probably not far behind um there's a lot of really big restaurants different themes um 

512.80 517.78 B: so y- you can really get like just about anything you want food wise 

517.84 518.98 B: and uh 

518.00 519.02 A: mm 

519.00 522.73 B: you know you you don't really necessarily have to spend a whole lot of money either 

522.82 532.08 B: 'cause i think people go out to eat so much you know they can't really make it a a great expensive dining experience every time they just you know want to spend twenty bucks for the two of them 

531.89 533.85 A: yeah like for a budget dinner 

533.92 540.16 B: yeah um so there's probably a ton of places to eat i mean i've been to houston uh it's 

540.33 542.94 B: about an hour from here and uh 

543.02 547.82 B: it's just vast i mean you know a very sprawling city you can't really walk anywhere so 

548.34 556.04 B: so that's kind of a down side 'cause i liked in san francisco it seemed like there were more uh just smaller places that you could walk to and stuff 

556.57 559.84 A: yeah we're kind of a a it's 

560.52 568.80 A: the city's actually declared big but we're only i believe uh six by six miles wide 

568.36 569.43 B: wow 

569.08 577.02 A: and everything once you get in here it's like everything's in walking distance and if it isn't there's a bus that'll take you five minutes 

577.21 579.01 A: ten minutes to get there 

578.65 586.12 B: yeah see houston's sprawling it's probably like i don't know thirty forty miles across [laughter] you know what i mean it it it's just this 

584.32 585.27 A: mm 

586.18 592.52 B: very it urban sprawl exemplified you know it's just a people drive everywhere so 

592.71 599.78 B: you know if something's ten miles away it's not really far [laughter] just jump in your car and go on the highway
