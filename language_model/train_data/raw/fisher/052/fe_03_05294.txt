0.37 1.44 A: (( hello )) 

1.08 3.94 B: yes my name's karl i'm f- in wisconsin 

4.18 6.67 A: hi i'm andrew and i'm in california 

5.97 8.24 B: andrew from california okay 

7.99 8.87 A: yep 

9.06 11.12 B: i've never done this before have you 

9.16 10.02 A: okay 

11.33 12.15 A: no 

12.21 13.16 B: (( okay )) 

13.40 18.57 B: the subject is what can we do to prevent what can the u._s. do to prevent terrorist attacks 

13.40 14.45 A: so 

18.61 21.50 A: yeah something like that what do you think 

21.64 23.33 B: yeah well i think ah 

23.82 28.65 B: i think we've really stepped up the the security and i i think that definitely has helped 

28.92 32.61 B: 'cause we really haven't had any over here for a while and ah 

32.72 34.49 B: i think there's gonna be more 

34.96 40.25 B: i really do and i i think it's just a matter of beefing up the security to make it a little tougher 

35.11 35.98 A: right 

40.55 41.41 B: (( i know )) 

40.65 41.53 A: (( yeah )) 

42.14 43.00 B: you know 

42.31 47.48 A: it i i think the ah security is um heightened security has definitely helped i 

47.50 60.41 A: remember i went to um italy a couple of years ago um in june of two thousand and one actually and i remember observing how much tighter their security was there and i thought it was kind of strange just compared to ours and and then um 

58.28 59.12 B: sure 

59.46 63.80 B: we were very we were very lax for years and years do you do any flying 

63.94 65.66 A: (( yeah )) 

64.82 70.68 B: okay i i'm recently retired i used to fly an awful lot when i was working 

70.77 76.22 B: ah since i retired i haven't flown too much but we went to disney world ah two months ago 

76.36 80.81 B: and i was amazed ah the airport security that was 

76.40 77.22 A: uh-huh 

81.22 85.39 B: you know i mean i really they really did a nice job the lines were very long 

81.38 82.43 A: right 

85.52 90.47 B: and everybody gets a little upset with time allowance but ah it's something you have to do 

90.55 92.26 B: and i thought they were doing a great job 

92.41 97.78 A: yeah i mean the ah the random screenings are a little bit inconvenient but if that's what we have to do you know 

97.46 98.25 B: sure 

98.38 105.69 B: the other thing i think they could do i think they could ah make the penalties penalties a little stiffer when they catch somebody 

105.58 106.63 A: yeah 

105.87 114.55 B: you know i think they just gotta hang 'em up by their thumbs and shoot 'em you know i i i can't see putting them in jail for thirty years or something i i think we gotta 

114.62 116.97 B: you gotta put a little fear into these guys 

117.16 120.68 A: [laughter] yeah yeah um i can see that 

119.82 120.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

120.72 130.42 A: um i mean personally i'm not terribly big on capital punishment but um except in certain situations then i guess this might qualify as one of them 

130.26 139.09 B: well yeah you know what the what they've done i mean do you the only real terrorist attack we've had over here was ah in new york with the the world trade center 

139.39 142.03 B: ah i can't recall any other 

139.61 140.59 A: (( yeah )) 

142.48 146.87 B: t- terrorist attacks that we've had on our on our grounds here in the u._s. 

147.18 150.78 B: but what they did i mean it was so just unreal 

151.11 155.83 B: and ah i think the penalty for what they did there you couldn't penalize them enough 

156.04 160.65 B: you know so i don't believe in capital punishment either but something like that i certainly do 

161.06 162.44 A: right 

162.22 168.01 B: i don't know what else we could do i really don't but i think they've done a nice j- i think president bush has done a great job 

168.50 171.24 A: yeah i mean i i think it's it's great to um 

171.43 178.88 A: to beef up the security just as as long as it doesn't involve too much of like a privacy invasion you know 

174.08 175.25 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

179.52 180.51 A: um 

180.91 181.76 A: 'cause i 

181.05 183.24 B: and i think how they're gonna put um 

183.58 187.96 B: they're gonna put some weapons in on a piloted aircraft i think that's fine 

188.01 189.08 A: yeah and th- that 

188.20 190.25 B: i think we gotta trust them you know 

190.20 192.89 A: yeah the air marshal's that's good 

191.62 192.53 B: sure 

193.20 197.25 B: so other than that i don't know you got any other ideas that somebody would like to hear um 

197.95 199.94 B: i don't know who's got the answer to it 

200.53 203.48 B: we got a lot of smart people trying to figure it out you know 

200.67 201.45 A: (( yeah )) 

203.35 206.08 A: right right and i think um 

206.13 210.46 A: i think the intelligence um s- situation you know is 

210.57 216.03 A: i think they're r- they're working on that too and that's a that's a that's a good thing i think that's 

213.15 213.96 B: sure 

215.32 216.59 B: oh yeah 

216.11 219.75 A: probably one of the most important parts too in addition to the security 

219.34 222.56 B: yeah well you know most of these terrorists they have 

222.82 229.18 B: you know they think they're gonna just ah go right to heaven if they do this you know that's their religious beliefs and ah 

226.84 227.83 A: right 

229.57 231.61 B: y- they think that they're gonna be 

231.88 235.70 B: in the hereafter they're gonna be ah praised for what they're doing 

235.78 236.71 A: right 

236.01 238.22 B: (( so i i guess that we're always gonna have it )) 

238.95 242.34 B: i don't think we'll ever be able to stop it i really don't 

238.95 239.90 A: (( yeah )) 

242.43 245.49 A: right 'cause people are gonna believe what they're gonna believe 

245.01 246.51 B: that's right 

247.52 250.50 A: you can't really force them to believe anything else 

249.34 250.87 B: (( that's right no no )) 

251.48 253.19 B: what part of california you live in okay 

253.40 257.01 A: um southern california somewhat near l._a. 

257.50 259.53 B: well i would have to think ah 

260.46 263.37 B: that would be prime area for a terrorist attack 

263.47 268.81 B: chicago l._a. new york i'm just in the mid west here we're in a small town 

265.52 266.54 A: (( b- yeah )) 

268.96 270.12 B: i don't think they 

268.97 270.66 A: where in wisconsin are you 

270.46 280.65 B: wisconsin yeah so i don't ah we don't have anything here that they could really destroy that would make an impact like the world trade center did 

280.90 281.75 A: right 

281.75 284.31 B: you know you got you've got you guys got ah 

284.59 288.81 B: so many people out there in chicago and i think if they would hit a 

288.99 292.72 B: a city they would hit one of the larger metropolitan areas 

292.69 293.79 A: right 

293.16 297.39 B: but hopefully ah hopefully we're not gonna let 'em do that 

297.12 301.22 A: right and i guess um i guess we foiled a lot of um 

300.41 301.71 B: oh sure 

301.51 303.33 A: different 

302.43 304.04 B: yeah but they're still out there 

303.88 305.56 A: right 

304.71 307.46 B: they're still waiting for the opportunity 

307.17 312.91 A: yeah they're just waiting for us to to let our defenses down even for a second 

311.80 313.13 B: sure sure 

313.84 318.90 B: yeah so i don't know what else to say about it i think the topic is ah 

319.13 322.31 B: a good topic to talk about but there ain't that much 

322.34 323.58 A: [laughter] right 

322.51 324.75 B: ah answers that y- i can come up with 

325.23 330.06 A: right yep well um how long has it been 

330.67 334.92 B: i don't know ten minutes long like a long time when you're just trying to talk make conversation 

335.84 336.82 A: right 

335.90 340.95 B: you sound like a young fella see i'm retired ah my kids are all grown 

341.15 351.43 B: after after the attack on september eleventh i really thought that my children and my grandchildren would never enjoy the life that we did 

351.77 355.42 B: i thought there would be a lot more changes than what has happened since then 

355.83 358.98 B: you know i thought i thought there was gonna be more 

356.02 356.95 A: (( yeah )) 

359.27 366.00 B: terrorist attacks right after that but um i guess because of the beefed up security we kinda put a stop to it for a while 

366.92 370.89 A: right but now it's like there's a lot more fear now i think too 

370.73 374.50 B: oh sure you know and i i'm sure they're gonna want to retaliate for what 

374.74 376.86 B: what we did over in iraq 

376.75 378.46 A: right 

377.49 381.93 B: you know i mean i'm sure you know the problem is all those people over there hate us 

381.95 383.78 A: right there was a um 

382.64 386.06 B: i mean really the far east hates us 

384.11 385.19 A: (( i don't know if you )) 

386.05 388.11 A: yeah i mean i don't know if you s- 

386.98 388.37 B: they have for years 

389.04 399.59 A: yeah i i don't know if you saw but there was a um there is a political cartoon writer writer march something like that there was a picture of one of those uncle sam posters you know that was like ah 

399.93 406.18 A: i want you to like uncle sam wants you to join the terrorist organization or something like that and it's 

405.18 408.04 B: yeah yeah like in world war two 

406.28 407.55 A: pulling like 

408.03 410.06 A: (( yeah )) 

408.79 410.29 B: yeah 

410.86 412.91 A: (( m- yeah )) 

411.11 413.16 B: i didn't see it 

413.37 415.77 A: (( and so i mean it's 'cause they're )) 

415.98 419.40 A: they're made to think that we're the enemy 

419.10 422.85 B: oh yeah yeah they they think um 

423.69 427.43 B: ah they just think we're all terrible people 'cause i i think 'cause we live 

427.69 432.25 B: we have a lot that they don't have i guess i don't know i don't know w- how else to explain it 

431.63 432.88 A: right 

432.56 435.19 B: i don't know if it's a jealousy thing or what 

435.45 437.66 A: well i've heard that um 

437.80 442.30 A: one one person that i've had in contact from who's from india mentioned something about 

442.31 450.96 A: that there's a lot of palestinians that get annoyed um they find out that these bombs that the israelis drop on them are from ah 

451.19 453.06 A: are made in the u._s. 

452.77 455.28 B: oh is that right i never heard that 

454.37 459.04 A: yeah that's i don't know h- how positively true that is but that's that's what i've heard 

460.23 462.85 A: and so you know that provides one reason 

462.73 463.84 B: (( oh yeah oh sure sure )) 

464.37 469.37 B: yeah it's just those people over there they kill themselves and y- over there you know with these suicide bombers 

469.95 474.81 B: you know it's just hard to figure out people have no regard for respect for human life 

475.43 476.80 A: right 

476.22 482.14 B: but the you know they've been at war over there for thousands of years you know there's never gonna be any peace over there 

482.24 484.16 B: i really don't think there ever will 

484.95 488.43 A: (( i mean there's always that possibility )) 

487.31 488.54 B: oh let's hope so 

489.40 490.68 B: let's hope so 

491.14 492.20 A: yes
