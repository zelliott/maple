68.93 69.90 B: mhm 

69.91 72.86 B: so do you have an opinion about this topic earl 

73.25 76.28 A: the ah arms inspection in iraq 

76.83 88.35 B: yeah i think it has something to do with that disarming like ah just should the u._s. be interested in disarming iraq something like that 

88.85 93.85 A: well yeah i've got mixed feelings on that ah you know when the war started i 

94.65 99.14 A: you know they they said they had a preponderance of evidence just no smoking gun about 

99.15 110.56 A: the weapons of mass destruction and they should ah disarm 'em ah you know i i feel saddam hussain was basically ah an evil person and a dictator and 

110.77 118.18 A: [lipsmack] um disarming the country and getting rid of him i think was a step for the common good 

118.26 120.23 B: i agree 

120.64 121.24 A: [mn] 

120.75 134.55 B: but ah now they're having trouble finding the weapons of mass destruction it almost seems like ah they were just saying they had 'em to ah scare everybody because they haven't found them yet 

133.90 140.91 A: well yeah i i agree ah you know they said they found those two trucks that supposedly were the mobile 

141.29 147.37 A: mobile ah labs for the bio weapons but that's all they've really found and there was no evidence within 

147.51 151.62 A: those trucks to ah substantiate it there there is no smoking gun 

151.77 155.60 A: and ah basically i think it was all 

155.85 159.14 A: all justification for the war itself for 

159.17 163.06 A: george bush to oust saddam hussain 

163.48 168.69 B: ahah but maybe that was a good idea because ah 

168.94 175.00 B: he ah he ah seems to have been a very bad leader ah who was ah 

175.10 180.73 B: a dictator ah kind of like adolf hitler and we shouldn't allow 

181.00 183.25 B: that type of thing to ah 

183.39 194.29 B: exist in the world because it could get out of hand ah winston churchill m- ah i remember a quote from winston churchill that said that um 

194.55 195.54 B: if 

196.70 205.35 B: if if you wait for ah evil to do its thing ah just because its not 

205.39 209.42 B: affecting you personally that um 

209.74 213.41 B: it could have very bad consequences later on 

213.82 217.84 B: so you have to you have to nip it in the bud you have to catch it early 

217.88 219.22 B: um 

219.34 230.54 B: other otherwise you [mn] if you get it late y- you could be so weak that you can't ah do anything about it i mean th- that's a paraphrase but it was something like that 

229.56 232.66 A: right well you know it's 

232.99 238.74 A: they didn't really catch it early ah saddam's been in power for you know decades 

238.61 239.64 B: mhm 

238.88 249.20 A: and you know i think it was twelve or fourteen years ago the united states actually was in ah cooperation with saddam hussain and actually did some trading for him 

249.91 251.43 A: ah way back when 

250.11 251.28 B: say that again 

251.94 253.10 B: say that again 

253.13 264.00 A: um actually the united states was in cooperation with iraq and saddam hussain and ah i think supplied him weapons at one point and actually ah did some training with him 

264.12 266.73 B: ah i didn't know that 

265.65 273.24 A: yeah so it's you know it's a tangled web government is never clean cut there's so many things going on behind the scenes that we don't know 

273.28 274.58 B: i agree 

274.69 279.40 A: it it was unfortunate that it came down to war to fix the problem 

279.64 281.49 B: (( ahah yeah )) 

280.54 285.21 A: you know the loss of life on both sides is regrettable it's tragic 

286.00 288.01 A: actually and you know i 

286.21 287.19 B: yeah 

288.96 291.76 A: [lipsmack] it's too bad it had to come to that 

292.03 295.29 A: but all in all i think it'll be for the best 

295.13 307.68 B: b- me too i i wh- when it was occurring and the the people were against it i i was thinking how you how could you be against such a thing but i've ah 

307.96 316.89 B: [lipsmack] modified my opinion a little bit because they can't find the weapons of mass destruction which is what it it was about another thing is um how 

317.36 324.71 B: i- it's not ah clear how closely tied in osama bin laden is to um 

324.97 326.09 B: um 

326.45 328.79 B: saddam hussain ahah 

326.79 327.75 A: saddam 

328.88 330.41 B: it's not clear 

329.07 330.13 A: yeah i'm 

330.38 337.11 A: i'm sure there's ties somewhere it just seems that ah a lot of those nations are just too cosy 

337.97 347.54 A: especially ah syria and libya you know there's a lot of top iraqis leaving iraq and going into ah syria i believe 

347.86 348.86 B: (( ahah [noise] )) 

348.73 358.50 A: you know i i think a a lot of those muslim nations are very much in cooperation with each other just as you know the united states is with canada and mexico and 

361.51 364.57 A: it's a it's a tangled web it is um ah 

368.58 371.77 B: is this what people talk about in bars do you think [mn] 

373.21 376.57 A: i'm sure some people talk about that in bars i 

376.09 382.13 B: i usually don't i usually don't have conversations about such things because um 

382.40 388.23 B: i don't feel that i have ah i can affect it too mu- too much 

388.35 398.30 B: now my my aunt pearl she's ah she does a lot of emailing on ah this ah on terrorism and the israeli situation 

398.20 403.42 B: and um she really gets into that but ah 

404.29 410.65 B: i ah i put most of my attention on stuff i can do something about you know what i mean 

409.90 421.56 A: we- yeah a lot of people believe in grass roots movements and you know having conversations and giving people ah more information that they don't have originally is somewhat of a grass roots 

421.81 432.87 A: movement type thing and you know basically it comes down to if someone has information and they go to vote in the next election well your vote should make a difference 

433.57 445.28 A: now in this p- this past election it came down very close and all the the florida debacle and counting the chits and you know who knows it could have been ah bush or ah i mean gore 

433.64 435.52 B: yeah 

445.16 446.27 B: [laughter] 

446.33 449.90 A: in the same situation i'm you know i'm glad we have bush i 

450.29 452.31 A: i would have rather had him than 

452.61 454.68 A: gore but 

454.57 458.91 B: well most people seem to think he's doing a good job 

459.35 468.49 A: well it's ah interesting i work with a a guy he's twenty five years old and he's from germany and him and i were on a trip and driving and we discussed this and ah 

469.45 472.30 A: he was actually ah ah pro 

472.60 474.27 A: (( war [noise] )) 

474.63 480.65 A: he actually thi- thought that ah taking saddam hussain out was a good thing 

479.80 480.68 B: (( ahah )) 

481.05 492.16 A: so ah it was it was very interesting to get ah international opinion on it even though you know most of germany was protesting he thought it was a good idea 

491.93 492.89 B: (( ahah )) 

494.64 495.73 B: (( hm ))
