18.25 23.29 B: if you ever can't hear me because of this band that's playing just let me know 

21.79 22.76 A: oh 

23.13 24.54 A: okay sure 

25.72 26.64 A: great 

26.63 29.37 B: so what was the topic again 

28.71 30.03 A: um 

30.38 33.24 A: the topic was disarming iraq 

32.57 35.49 B: (( oh yeah it )) 

33.92 35.86 A: what the u._s. should do about it 

36.46 48.80 B: seems a little bit well i guess we could still talk about what to do in the aftermath of the war but the way that they phrased the topic made it sound like maybe they phrased it about two months ago 

44.99 46.42 A: [mn] 

48.50 53.69 A: yeah yeah it sounded like ah we hadn't done anything yet at all but [mn] 

53.84 57.27 A: um [mn] are they still fighting over there 

56.62 63.10 B: oh yeah people are still getting killed i guess ah i was just thinking when i saw 

57.31 57.87 A: (( [cough] )) 

58.70 59.28 A: (( [mn] )) 

63.26 74.54 B: some news item about ah some people being killed in iraq how that must be really confusing for their families you know they probably felt the war was over [mn] 

72.52 73.33 A: yeah 

73.96 76.37 A: [mn] [mn] yeah yeah right 

75.36 81.35 B: they probably heard that news and thought well nothing more to worry about 

80.20 83.80 A: right right it's weird [mn] 

83.52 95.21 B: hang on one second [noise] okay sorry about that 

93.79 95.02 A: (( all right )) 

95.84 99.14 B: so [mn] yeah i guess what ah 

98.88 100.28 A: (( [mn] )) 

100.29 102.72 B: what i picked up is ah 

102.79 110.28 B: there's still some saddam loyalists over there who are are getting involved in skirmishes with ah 

105.97 107.47 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

110.52 113.57 B: the soldiers that are still there 

113.53 115.58 A: [mn] it's just ah i 

115.61 117.46 A: don't understand how 

118.19 119.30 A: (( like a )) 

119.32 125.22 A: normal functioning person could [mn] support [cough] somebody like that 

125.31 126.94 B: (( you mean like saddam )) 

126.56 127.47 A: yes 

127.24 141.58 B: well i guess it's just that you know they- they're born in iraq and they grew up having it beaten into their heads and they never really had access to any other ideas besides that saddam is is all there is 

136.58 137.57 A: right 

140.03 140.59 A: (( [mn] )) 

141.39 143.78 A: [cough] [mn] it's a good point [mn] [mn] 

143.13 153.70 B: which makes me wonder you know now what what they're gonna do i mean i hope that it doesn't end up being like the former soviet union 

153.07 154.58 A: (( nah i don't )) 

153.77 161.70 B: where they basically embraced capitalism right away and they're not quite ready for it so now it's just run by gangs 

161.36 167.76 A: right exactly no we don't want another russia [mn] man [cough] 

169.01 170.61 A: i guess what i'm ah 

170.65 171.64 A: (( ah )) 

172.37 182.99 A: yeah i guess that's part of my the main thing i'd be concerned about too 'cause there are you know i think that ah they really want democracy to work there but 

183.92 191.84 B: i i just wonder if ah i mean 'cause [mn] up to this point a lot of those people have no idea what democracy is 

190.61 192.91 A: [cough] right right 

192.11 198.30 B: so i wonder how they're gonna adjust i mean it seems like a lot of 'em are are programmed to 

198.55 205.60 B: bow down to anybody that comes through with enough firepower and i wonder if that's not just gonna happen again 

202.63 203.91 A: [mn] yeah 

205.23 210.90 A: yeah [mn] and you know they ah the other groups wanna 

211.11 212.10 A: um 

212.32 215.36 A: (( [mn] some of the iranian groups you know they wanna [mn] )) 

215.60 217.61 A: have a theocracy [cough] [mn] 

217.55 221.57 B: yeah that well there's there's a big contingent for ah 

221.86 226.13 B: yeah just ah making it an an islamic state 

225.53 226.79 A: yeah 

226.22 227.29 B: which 

227.14 233.66 B: it seems like you know if there is some way to make that work without it turning into a 

233.44 242.34 B: some thug basically using that to keep everybody under his thumb and that that's okay with me but i haven't really seen it happen 

235.71 236.67 A: yeah 

241.90 246.00 A: mhm [mn] and you know that's really what saddam did he was a 

246.44 251.66 A: he was s- supposedly a muslim but the guy was just a hypocrite [mn] 

250.70 253.88 B: (( he was like he was an apostate as far as all i g- )) 

252.21 253.37 A: yeah 

253.80 267.20 B: the one thing i never bought was the idea that he was in league with bin laden because all those people had fatwas and ah hits taken out on each other because as far as they were concerned 

258.79 259.86 A: right 

264.45 265.67 A: yeah 

267.16 277.64 B: saddam was was using islam just to to further his own agenda which i i'm i'm worried is the the exact same thing just repeated so 

271.50 272.80 A: exactly 

276.72 278.43 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

279.17 281.41 A: i'm telling you p- it seems like 

281.54 282.51 A: (( ah )) 

282.70 292.34 A: you know people use any means necessary if they're power hungry you know if that even includes like using a peaceful religion or whatever 

291.92 298.98 B: yeah and if if you're taking over a country full of people that have been basically brainwashed since birth 

298.11 299.07 A: (( right [cough] )) 

298.99 307.47 B: t- and told over and over again that they're gonna be shot if they say something bad about the the dictator it's hard to believe that you can just say 

302.95 303.70 A: (( [cough] )) 

306.00 306.93 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

307.59 317.84 B: well all right that's all over now you know go out and start small businesses and don't take any shit from anybody i just wonder how that's gonna work 

312.68 316.76 A: [laughter] [mn] 

317.30 327.62 A: that's [laughter] that's a really good point [mn] yeah i doubt i mean how do you do that i mean that's that's i can't even begin to comprehend what that next step is i mean i 

327.83 331.31 A: i grew up in the u._s. you know and it's like [mn] 

331.30 339.81 B: i can't pretend to know what it's like to be an iraqi and all of a sudden just have things do a complete one eighty like they have 

333.72 334.29 A: (( [mn] )) 

338.46 339.49 A: yeah 

339.62 340.67 A: i mean 

341.87 353.20 A: [mn] oh that's wild i mean no wonder that no wonder it's like complete chaos well it was initially you know i'm sure people are just freaking out they don't even know what to do [mn] 

353.24 354.36 A: (( you know )) 

353.26 355.08 B: a lot of them are just still 

355.06 366.49 B: don't really believe it like they don't real- they think that america's gonna come in and and set up an an american dictatorship 'cause that's all they're really familiar with 

356.62 357.62 A: yeah 

364.77 365.38 A: [mn] 

365.79 366.83 A: right 

366.47 379.00 B: as soon as they see tanks rolling into town they figure well you know we better figure out who sent them and not say anything mean about them 'cause it's just gonna be another dictatorship 

368.99 369.95 A: right 

375.37 376.94 A: (( yeah ))
