524.76 526.66 A: like carbohydrates 

526.85 528.05 B: yeah 

528.05 536.37 A: and that's why i feel guilty about eating the pasta tonight if i ate it at at home my wife would make whole wheat pasta

538.84 548.29 A: is better for you in that sense it doesn't turn it's not like made from flou- you you know what i mean it doesn't become sugar 

548.39 553.35 A: in in your blood but on the other hand it [laughter] doesn't have the taste either 

553.54 555.30 B: (( [mn] mhm [laughter] ))

563.13 566.17 B: [mn] it doesn't taste good huh 

565.55 579.00 A: it's [mn] it's not that it doesn't taste it doesn't taste bad but it i don't i don't think it tastes terrific that's why [laughter] i get tired of eating at home because we broil chicken
