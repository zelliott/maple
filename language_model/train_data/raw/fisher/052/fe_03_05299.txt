0.07 1.15 B: hello 

0.41 1.39 A: hello 

1.98 3.52 B: hi my name's james 

3.42 4.65 A: hey i'm david 

4.26 5.32 B: (( how's it going )) 

5.15 6.77 A: (( not too bad how're you doing )) 

6.11 7.70 B: i'm pretty good [laughter] 

7.60 8.56 A: um 

8.80 10.87 A: (( all right this is the first time i've done this so )) 

10.51 13.63 B: oh okay yeah this is the second so [laughter] for me so 

13.56 15.21 A: (( all right ah )) 

14.20 15.13 B: um 

16.02 19.17 B: go ahead ant thoughts on the topic 

18.03 18.92 A: (( um )) 

19.53 30.47 A: huh i don't this is it's a kinda of a tricky to me because i don't i mean besides increased intelligence i'm not sure there's much we can do i mean you can only fight terrorism just to a degree 

29.86 30.86 B: yeah 

30.76 32.11 A: and ah 

32.56 34.35 A: have there's only y- you can 

34.58 42.54 A: increase your intelligence i guess and try to ah keep up with what's going on but bioterrorism's particularly scary just because it's 

43.63 45.79 A: i don't know it seems like it's harder to detect 

45.49 46.58 B: yeah 

46.67 57.46 B: well ah what i'm what i wonder about is like the whole anthrax scare that that was a while back and there's still not very much information of where that came from or you know 

52.31 53.53 A: yeah 

57.54 60.68 B: so if we can't even prevent something like that then 

61.33 62.36 B: um 

63.69 67.01 A: i yeah um it seems 

67.14 71.12 A: it seems like we're so geared up for 

70.99 74.95 A: preventing something like like if we we was going somewhere with tight security 

74.54 75.42 B: mhm 

74.75 87.40 A: you could metal detect go through a metal detector and maybe you know they search for explosives or guns and everything is so geared towards that but it doesn't seem like there's really much in place to search for 

82.26 83.07 B: mhm 

87.28 91.60 A: someone getting on a plane with some sort of biochemical weapon you know 

90.75 97.73 B: mhm mhm yeah what i was i've read an article not so long ago about um do you know about ricin 

92.57 94.34 A: i'd 

97.89 99.19 A: about what 

98.46 99.54 B: (( ricin )) 

99.35 100.71 A: no i do not 

99.99 101.26 B: it's um 

101.61 115.59 B: it's a highly lethal chemical that you can make from um i'm trying to remember what kind of it's just like a bean that you n- some kind of process that that people can make it just relatively easily and you know a very small amount can kill 

112.26 113.48 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

115.47 117.97 B: you know a hundred people so 

118.20 121.02 B: you know if people were able to create the stuff i wonder if 

121.40 129.44 B: 'cause you know since the anthrax thing there hasn't been too much of like anything like that going on so i wonder how much of that's hyped up as well as 

129.64 130.65 B: (( you know )) 

130.84 134.46 B: that maybe they are catching a lot of stuff with intelligence and 

134.80 143.08 A: yeah you have to i mean you have to wonder how good i mean how good a job they're doing i- it could be there could be lots of stuff that goes on that they just don't tell you about because you'd be scared 

141.67 142.50 B: mhm 

143.87 151.73 A: ah [laughter] it's the whole ill- sounds like the whole men in black thing you know like all this stuff goes on but if everyone knew about it they'd be crazy 

147.20 148.87 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

151.03 152.78 B: yeah exactly 

152.93 155.10 B: yeah i don't know if they [sigh] [lipsmack] 

156.24 166.56 B: i mean i can't really think of much else that the the you know the government could do ah besides people just being more aware of people around them i guess you know suspicious people doing you 

167.27 168.74 A: yeah um 

167.37 170.33 B: know or watching certain certain you know 

170.62 171.76 B: um 

171.96 176.78 B: you know undergrounds groups militia groups and stuff like that that might and terrorist groups 

176.87 180.47 A: yeah do you have well do you have an opinion on profiling 

180.55 181.52 B: um 

182.07 185.51 B: mm it it's so tricky with that because 

185.94 187.05 B: you know 

188.71 196.99 B: i i se- you know i see where people come from where yeah they shouldn't just they can't just randomly pick people 'cause if they just pick some old woman in a wheelchair that's eighty years old 

197.09 203.83 B: to check you know it seems kind of like a waste of time but at the same time it i see where 

200.10 201.20 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

203.84 209.04 B: you know people's rights are being violated because of the way they may look and and things like that so 

209.56 210.73 B: (( i i can't )) 

209.62 211.82 A: yeah i agree with oh go ahead 

210.76 214.08 B: can't ever come up with like a a decision on that [laughter] 

213.92 215.96 A: yeah i i go back and forth i i 

215.99 228.21 A: the the logical part of me says you know it makes sense to you don't look for someone you don't look at someone unless you think there's a chance they're doing something wrong and i- i- it's not it's not fair that the world's that way but i mean that's 

228.37 229.23 B: yeah 

228.58 230.84 A: the majority of the attackers are that way 

230.86 237.26 A: on the other hand i [sigh] it's i i don't like saying that 'cause it's really easy for me to say that as a white male 

236.92 238.19 B: mhm 

237.50 243.60 A: you know [laughter] see i'm c- probably not the one who's gonna to get called out for it so 

241.54 254.65 B: right of course you have then there's n- then i wonder how mu- how well it'll work when you have people like somebody like ah you know timothy mcveigh or the uni bomber or somebody like that that would probably not get picked out you know 

254.10 255.90 A: yeah 

255.34 261.55 B: um that wouldn't fit the profile of what people are looking for now as far as the terrorist um 

256.12 257.94 A: yeah 

260.95 262.86 A: yeah 

262.94 264.09 B: (( but um [laughter] )) 

263.32 266.50 A: [laughter] in conclusion i guess the world is just um 

266.52 274.45 A: lot's of shit can go wrong in the world and [laughter] it's kind i guess i guess i tend just to not to worry about it and assume that 

268.19 269.81 B: yeah 

273.53 287.42 B: i think that's m- that's the thing with the bioterrorism is that i mean things are gonna happen regardless and there's only i mean not that you shouldn't the the government people shouldn't try and stop it but that people can't let it run their lives 

284.79 286.26 A: [laughter] 

286.39 287.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

287.57 292.19 A: yeah you can't live in fear of that kind of thing because at that point then 

292.33 299.41 A: there there's so much that could be going on that you can't stop that [noise] you just have to do you know live your life and hope that hope for the best 

293.81 294.51 B: yeah 

294.92 295.77 B: yeah 

298.97 299.71 B: (( yeah ah )) 

300.62 301.54 A: um 

302.02 303.21 A: (( [noise] hm )) 

303.28 305.19 A: anything else interesting on the topic h- 

304.69 307.77 B: [laughter] trying to think here 

308.87 310.95 B: are you more of like a 

311.19 313.73 B: republican democrat leaning oh right 

313.00 323.45 A: um [noise] um i tend to be more republican but well [noise] ah middle of the road republican [noise] [noise] um [noise] what about you 

323.19 325.65 B: okay um pretty middle of the road um 

326.72 333.81 B: i'm not too happy with like the r- whole republican ideology right now 'cause it just seems like everything's war war war and 

333.43 335.21 A: yeah 

334.07 335.11 B: um 

335.25 339.81 B: when the economy's doing so bad and other things here aren't doing too good 

339.56 342.75 A: yeah the econ- [laughter] i'm a i'm 

342.77 345.57 A: about to be a senior in college right next year 

345.18 346.47 B: mhm 

345.86 352.50 A: and ah i just i had a lot of friends that just graduated and the the economy is apparently jus- i mean just it's been really hard to get a job 

351.95 353.14 B: yeah 

352.75 353.69 A: um 

354.21 358.81 A: just ah peop- lots of people are just going to grad school just because they can't get a job 

358.31 360.09 B: (( i guess that's one method [laughter] yeah um )) 

359.45 360.40 A: [noise] 

361.15 362.70 A: but 

363.22 368.17 B: yeah it's it's kind of interesting i actually work at a a local police department um 

367.14 367.97 A: uh-huh 

368.32 370.25 B: and like 

370.44 380.03 B: when you hear about how like the federal government's trying to pass onto the city and local government's information to try and get you know to work from the- with them and it's l- 

380.18 387.29 B: like when the we raise the terr- when the terror alert's raised in the police department like we don't really do anything different you know 

382.79 383.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

386.52 388.37 A: mhm 

387.42 388.45 B: um 

388.49 389.50 B: it's pretty much 

388.70 390.37 A: you don't do anything different 

389.71 391.24 B: i mean they they 

391.27 400.72 B: watch things a little bit more but and they do more ch- daily checks of the buildings you know major buildings in the area and stuff like that but um 

396.31 396.94 A: (( [noise] )) 

398.78 400.82 A: mhm 

401.67 406.41 A: [noise] do you did you say do you work for are you a policeman or a police officer or 

405.13 410.73 B: n- no no um i do data entry so i enter the police reports and things like that 

410.12 414.40 A: oh okay do you know like do they deal a lot with terrorism or is that something that 

414.29 426.68 B: um the that's the thing is that i think that they they do have to do more like checks of the major buildings and stuff like that which i think just takes away from the regular community policing and so 

420.86 423.45 A: mhm 

427.01 428.93 A: mhm 

427.54 439.78 B: you know it doesn't actually help the community any you know and i don't think that it it tr- it should be really relevant for 'cause this is a small city outside of orlando so i could see if it was like atlanta you know 

437.12 438.07 A: (( oh )) 

439.85 441.51 A: yeah 

440.04 441.96 B: police they definitely you know 

442.25 444.56 B: but a major city like that but 

444.82 447.62 A: w- well well then w- where do you draw the line though 

448.22 452.34 B: mm see that's the thing is i don't know i don't know i just 

452.36 453.74 B: 'cause i see 

454.35 455.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

454.68 459.23 B: you know f- fewer reports come through when the you know the officers are 

459.24 464.93 B: you know off just having to do re- routine checks of things and it doesn't seem like you know 

465.73 472.95 B: maybe some of those things in the community aren't getting taken care of because of that and that like the whole terror alert system 

473.56 480.59 B: they had you know they say oh we have information that there could be a terror alert at some time some place well 

475.33 478.42 A: (( yeah )) 

480.64 482.36 A: [laughter] yeah 

481.29 483.40 B: okay [laughter] 

483.02 491.89 A: yeah it seems like they wanna try to alert you but not well j- just tell you something might go on but then not tell you anything about it which doesn't seem very helpful at all 

488.94 490.07 B: (( right mm )) 

492.60 493.66 A: um 

493.67 495.85 A: [laughter] 

496.69 498.24 A: [lipsmack] let's see 

497.51 498.80 B: [laughter] 

498.32 500.04 A: [laughter] um 

501.85 503.93 A: (( how l- how long have we been talking )) 

503.74 506.94 B: ah it should be getting close to ten minutes here [laughter] 

506.33 512.09 A: yeah i'm trying to think so are you pretty anti are you pretty against the war 

507.32 508.25 B: (( i don't think )) 

512.00 512.95 B: um 

513.36 519.57 B: m- i think that it need to ge- to get that iraq needed to be taken care of like that i just think that the whole 

517.81 518.69 A: uh-huh 

520.14 523.49 B: bush was saying that they were such a threat to the u._s. 

523.28 525.02 A: mhm 

523.46 527.88 B: which i don't think that was the case i think you know and now they're talking turn around and trying to say well 

527.80 538.50 B: we were lib- liberating the iraqi people and that was the right reason to do it i don't think that this whole you know weapons of mass destruction and the threat to the u._s. i mean 

530.70 532.34 A: mhm 

539.01 542.23 A: so you think we should've done it but you don't think that our reason was right no 

539.06 539.89 B: 'cause i 

541.81 545.31 B: i don't think the reason that ah was originally given was right no 

545.33 546.39 B: that those 

546.44 547.56 A: but i don't think 

546.45 548.73 B: that they had weapons and 

548.69 558.79 A: do you think the people would've backed a war if for the for the liberation of the iraqi peop- like do you think i mean obviously i guess you would've and honestly i probably would've too but i don't know that much of america would've 

558.50 559.63 B: (( yeah that's n- )) 

560.24 561.71 B: that's true but 

562.24 563.21 A: a- and if 

563.42 569.08 A: ah i though though i'm not sure that the reason that bush wanted to go to war was for the liberation of the iraqi people either 

568.63 569.37 B: no 

569.24 570.85 A: [laughter] 

569.70 572.85 B: and i didn't i don't think that at all but 

572.05 574.24 A: [laughter] yeah 

573.25 587.44 B: um and it's kinda scary now because you've got s- a country like north korea that does seem to be a real threat you know to our safety with nuclear capabilities and things and we don't seem to really it's like oh well what do we care 

586.77 592.32 A: yeah it yeah it makes you question [laughter] whether the qu- why we went into iraq 

592.51 593.66 A: (( i- if we're )) 

593.86 596.22 A: if we're not gonna mess mess with them at all 

596.21 599.89 B: yeah yeah 'cause i think if if they did actually if there was any 

596.44 597.57 A: um
