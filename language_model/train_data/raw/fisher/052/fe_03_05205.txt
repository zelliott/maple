158.60 159.60 A: yeah 

158.93 160.26 B: believe me 

160.12 168.79 A: yeah the humidity right now especially is real oppressive and [mn] it stays that way right up until uh mid october 

160.51 161.40 B: and 

163.48 165.18 B: mhm 

168.50 169.77 B: yeah 

169.20 170.17 A: so 

170.37 172.66 A: we don't do much cooking out [laughter] 

172.46 173.59 B: (( yeah i )) 

173.70 177.15 B: know the heat and humidity spoils the fun of that you know 

177.30 181.13 A: i imagine from texas that you prefer beef i'm just guessing 

180.66 190.91 B: oh yeah uh my wife's [mn] just the opposite uh she she does the chicken thing mostly and um grilled chicken you know and um she she's kind of a health food 

191.02 193.53 B: nut you know she she don't eat 

191.79 193.27 A: yeah so's 

193.57 194.73 A: so's my wife 

194.65 202.69 B: yeah [laughter] that that's probably why the men usually die sooner [laughter] no women maybe we should maybe we should learn a lesson from 'em 

197.73 199.08 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

199.88 200.60 A: (( yes )) 

202.39 204.19 A: yeah i think so [laughter] 

203.04 205.27 B: but um but um 

205.35 207.50 B: but no we we just um 

208.19 214.70 B: you know we we grocery shop and just buy stuff that convenient that we can prepare for the kids you know [mn] 

214.84 221.45 B: you know just get [mn] as cheap as we can and um you know we might go out to eat maybe two times a month or something the whole family but uh 

220.48 222.12 A: oh i s- yeah 

221.58 223.43 B: not not real often 

222.79 224.62 A: i can understand that 

224.27 226.55 B: (( but i um )) 

226.12 229.26 A: our eating habits have really changed over the years 

229.35 230.27 A: um 

230.95 235.29 A: i would say in the last ten years especially now that uh 

235.39 244.76 A: we've become so much more aware of uh fat content and uh and uh sugar in the soft drinks and things like that 

240.33 241.73 B: right 

242.47 244.26 B: mhm 

244.54 245.61 B: yeah 

244.98 253.53 A: that uh maybe we should've been uh a little more aware of it earlier in our life but it it seems to have really come out in the news 

253.65 257.42 A: oh i'd say in the last ten fifteen years maybe 

257.33 258.39 B: yeah 

257.59 268.71 A: and maybe that's why we've kind of drifted away from beef a little bit is because of the the concern about red meat and your cholesterol and things like that so we 

266.70 269.30 B: right yeah 

268.63 274.65 A: we kind of stick to uh pork and chicken things that are 

275.09 277.20 A: a little bit more healthy for you 

276.80 279.38 B: right exactly 

278.41 282.56 A: and i and i really wasn't much of a salad eater at all 

283.20 286.47 A: uh i would say until the last ten years [mn] 

285.87 288.08 B: mhm 

288.12 297.07 B: sometimes that's all my wife will get is a salad i'm like man i don't understand that i don't see how you can just eat a salad as a meal [laughter] i mean me it might be a 

292.28 293.30 A: [laughter] 

296.48 297.11 A: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

296.94 304.55 B: eat eat eat before the meal but uh it just don't fill me up you know i know now it has chicken and everything else in it but um 

304.63 315.42 B: you know i'm not a real big salad eater but um do you and your wife do you al- always agree on where you're gonna go or does she want to sometimes go one somewhere and you want to go another place 

314.98 318.96 A: uh pretty much we decide together to go wherever 

318.68 319.73 B: yeah 

319.09 321.46 A: it's it's usually uh 

323.72 332.50 A: [mn] it's something that we both prefer to go to that we agree on usually it's not it's not uh a one sided thing like 

328.59 329.54 B: so 

331.71 332.83 B: right 

333.14 336.83 A: but we generally like to go to the same type of restaurants 

336.51 338.16 B: so do you all eat out like 

338.43 340.73 B: five times a week or what 

339.60 343.65 A: i would s- i would say pretty close to that yeah yeah 

342.03 343.17 B: yeah 

343.34 349.71 B: so you probably spend three four hundred dollars a month on eating out at least i would say 

348.70 351.29 A: oh well god i would say um 

350.56 352.30 B: uh more than that probably 

351.88 355.01 A: yeah it's probably closer to seven hundred [laughter] 

354.30 358.91 B: (( yeah [laughter] yeah two people eating out almost every day yeah )) 

357.68 361.02 A: but see you see it when you're retired 

361.47 363.61 A: that um 

364.28 377.64 A: some of that money that you use for entertaining you know taking your kids to ball games or or whatever [mn] you know we've got that money that we can use just to go eat out 

371.12 372.61 B: right 

372.94 373.89 B: yeah 

377.40 379.28 B: right exactly 

377.72 383.08 A: because we don't we don't have to buy clothes for the kids and well you know what i mean 

381.30 382.38 B: yeah 

383.05 384.58 B: yeah exactly 

383.12 387.12 A: and the and the grocery bill at the store is not as much so 

386.61 387.72 B: right 

387.14 391.56 A: it tends to give you a little bit more money to eat out 

391.01 392.64 B: yeah 

391.93 393.05 A: i mean we're 

393.07 395.32 A: we're moderately uh 

396.18 401.65 A: i would call us a moderate income we're not we're not a high income couple at all 

398.37 399.56 B: yeah 

401.13 409.14 B: right but um yeah now that you've got the kids out of the house man that's huge as far as the money goes oh man 

407.48 410.78 A: [laughter] especially after college 

410.59 413.50 B: oh my gosh i'm i'm 

412.39 418.87 A: and i you know i really i feel for you when they get that age because it's it's rough it really is 

418.35 422.44 B: i know i got a few years to go my oldest one's nine years old and um 

422.66 432.55 B: you know [laughter] when they get into co- i'm gonna have i got four kids they're all two years apart so that's that is going to be tough but we're going have to start working on scholarships or something 

433.36 434.69 B: (( but um )) 

433.51 436.53 A: yeah it it's not easy 

437.68 439.05 B: but um 

438.42 441.62 A: if i could offer some advice i i would uh 

441.83 453.87 A: i would tend to send them the first two years to a a community college where they [cough] where they can commute from home to school and then [cough] the last two years they can 

447.26 448.43 B: right 

450.95 452.14 B: yeah 

454.01 460.05 A: transfer those credits to a university and and you can save a lot a money that way 

457.12 458.27 B: mhm 

459.79 461.77 B: yeah that's a good idea 

460.37 464.02 A: and i actually i actually think that's better for 'em anyways 

463.73 471.92 B: yeah well they still graduate from a a university [mn] um you know that's all anybody cares about you know 

467.27 468.40 A: that's right 

470.96 475.47 A: we're kind a drifting away from the from the topic here but 

475.15 478.37 B: yeah we are but [laughter] um 

479.33 481.17 B: but you know 

480.04 484.40 A: it all boils down to what you can afford at that time in your life 

484.38 490.38 B: yeah that's true i mean we would definitely eat out a lot more if it wasn't for the uh the the expense 

490.51 499.83 B: and uh but still even so i think if i could totally afford to eat out every single meal i'd still like to eat at at home sometimes in front of the t._v. or whatever uh 

498.28 499.45 A: mhm 

499.88 504.93 B: you know just stick something in the oven or you know uh we never cook fancy meals 

503.29 507.40 A: oh i was i was the same way when when our kids were at home 

507.29 508.50 B: (( yeah )) 

509.07 514.37 A: the only time we usually ate out when the kids were home were [mn] like a saturday or sunday 

514.22 515.27 B: right 

514.46 524.73 A: but uh the holidays thanksgiving was probably our biggest holiday we and still is we have uh the whole family over for turkey and that's something special 

526.27 527.40 B: right 

527.62 534.35 B: [mn] did you all say you you all cook on like holidays at home like christmas and thanksgiving that that 

531.64 541.44 A: right yeah we usually we usually eat in and have the family over for holidays and it's usually it's usually turkey 

541.06 542.35 B: yeah 

541.48 543.85 A: that seems to be the big favorite 

544.55 545.81 B: (( yeah )) 

546.03 554.18 B: i like uh most those kind of occasions the leftovers you know [laughter] is as good as do the actual m- meal when everybody sits around the table you know 

554.28 558.17 B: just cut some turkey and throw it in the microwave and you know 

556.71 559.13 A: yeah hot turkey sandwiches 

558.57 561.88 B: (( oh yeah with mayonnaise oh man that's the greatest )) 

562.29 563.60 B: but um 

564.37 569.33 A: yeah it seems like every every thanksgiving we're watching the dallas cowboys play somebody [laughter] 

569.16 570.46 B: (( oh yeah )) 

570.57 575.00 B: hopefully they'll start winning some of those but uh yeah we al- [laughter] we always watch those too 

575.24 579.43 B: and um usually eating leftovers but um 

580.82 584.84 A: i've noticed too that we've become a lot more uh 

584.98 591.21 A: vegetable eaters in in our later years here too i'm in my fif- i'm in my fifties now 

589.01 590.29 B: oh yeah 

591.00 592.34 B: yeah 

591.69 595.88 A: and uh i wasn't a big vegetable eater but i'll tell you y- 

596.01 599.86 A: you get so much more health conscious when you're
