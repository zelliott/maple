89.28 92.37 A: okay it is canada i know but not in the states 

92.17 101.87 B: [noise] well it it it's actually works out better ah as a prescription right now 'cause it's cheaper 'cause they write you a three month supply but [laughter] 

96.97 98.66 A: oh yeah uh-huh 

101.18 113.86 A: yeah no that makes sense yeah i i don't know like when i when i start to feel something's coming on i usually start popping claritins you know every like one a day the twenty four hour ones but i mean 

106.88 107.69 B: yeah 

111.90 122.97 B: yeah well if you now now do you does that get worse now this that's a good question for the change of seasons now you you don't have a change of seasons perse but isn't there like varying degrees of smog 

118.00 119.21 A: yeah 

123.13 135.59 A: yeah i guess so yeah that's true the visibility it's not as bad as it used to be but yeah i just i when i start popping claritins ah it's mostly to prevent something from happening if i feel bad already it doesn't really help that much 

123.14 126.53 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

135.01 137.86 B: not really yeah that's true allegra does the same thing 

137.59 139.54 A: yeah 

137.72 147.77 B: you you gotta if you know it's gonna come it's good but once you you know it's funny 'cause what i was gonna say 'cause my uncle used to live in los angeles he moved to san diego because he said in ah 

147.57 154.94 B: los angeles their change of seasons was when it got cam to like june july they started to get like smog in there [laughter] 

154.12 163.98 A: oh yeah definitely yeah although it was pretty cold last week um but i don't i don't notice it with the seasons i mean i used to live in philadelphia and even when i was there 

157.35 158.90 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

163.88 170.20 A: i didn't i didn't notice with the seasons more than just the actual temperature outside

211.98 221.39 A: um so ah let's see what else ah what about other stuff like did like joints or i guess you know some people have problems with arthritis or joint stuff 

219.43 229.31 B: oh yeah that that actually yeah i mean that that that that's actually a good reason to live in ah l._a. 'cause at least it's humid all year so you don't get the [laughter] 

228.40 234.36 A: it's actually not that humid like right now it's really more humid where you're at than it is here it's it's a pretty comfortable 

232.22 236.50 B: yeah every time i've been there it's been so humid it yeah 

234.66 235.85 A: really 

236.16 238.64 A: oh wow you won't have the problem in vegas 

236.83 238.11 B: yeah actually 

238.20 244.43 B: actually i don't think anything is as humid as we are right now so it's bad [mn] 

242.55 244.73 A: i was gonna say yeah i mean 

244.91 247.68 B: yeah it's bad jersey gets bad with humid 

247.43 255.69 A: yeah it does it's awful during the summertime [mn] you the west coast almost never gets as bad as as the north east during that time 

254.92 269.78 B: yeah in the win- ah the winter's even like wet here i mean like i've been actu- yeah well i've been to um where was i actually i'd never been out west yeah 'cause my father went to san francisco my parents went to san francisco in the winter and they said it's like a di- totally different type of ah 

259.57 260.75 A: (( it really )) 

269.79 272.17 B: (( you know 'cause we got like that cold haze )) 

272.01 274.77 A: yeah no it's not like that at all out here 

273.90 279.87 B: yeah and you can you got you got that in philly 'cause i know in philly they get that wet cold haze too [noise] [cough] 

279.22 294.10 A: mhm yeah that's that's kind of true but in in l._a. i mean it's not just 'cause i'm originally from here but it's pretty much the most comfortable level of humidity you could have it it's not very dry and it's not very humid unless you come from a dry area you'll think it's humid 

293.81 294.73 B: (( right [mn] )) 

294.17 305.53 A: but it's not it's not bad in any way it's just absolutely perfect with that but man it gets so muggy up by new york around there and it just kills me my my allergies and it's just 

301.83 302.58 B: (( oh yeah )) 

303.22 304.02 B: yeah 

305.86 310.47 A: ugh your nose just plugs up you can't breathe right i hate that 

308.60 318.69 B: that that's the one good thing i'm waiting about to go to las vegas is 'cause i know when i get there it's it's you know at least gonna be dry i can not worry about my allergies for a week [laughter] 

313.28 314.94 A: yeah 

317.79 319.42 A: yeah really huh 

319.10 320.89 B: (( [mn] you know i i ah ah )) 

321.24 325.98 B: that's that's well i mean except that peop- we're staying at the rio 

326.00 328.06 A: oh yeah right of the strip sure 

327.36 330.43 B: yeah so some people have said that it it's a little bit ah 

330.45 333.63 B: [laughter] it's a little bit smokey there but we don't ah we don't 

332.81 341.70 A: oh yeah anywhere in vegas will be smokey though so you'll problems no matter where you're at and actually the buffet at the at the rio's awesome you'll really enjoy that if you go 

335.71 336.60 B: yeah 

340.82 343.02 B: ah the seafood one or the other one [cough] 

342.05 351.45 A: ah i haven't been to the seafood one but the big one's really really good yeah so what's the i guess we're getting off topic let's see what else 

345.81 348.62 B: oh good gotta try that yeah 

350.27 354.92 B: [laughter] ah yeah i think you drift well it's funny 'cause the last time i did this 

354.21 355.96 A: yeah 

354.94 359.27 B: i got one topic and the person i was talking to got another topic 

358.62 367.05 A: i don't ah my my assumption is they're interested in the topic at all they're just interested in vocal patterns and inflections and 

366.54 368.11 B: yeah probably 

367.45 373.56 A: and that stuff voice recognition purposes they just give you a topic to just kind of run with it 

372.14 377.03 B: and see how to see whether you can keep sustain a conversation [laughter] 

375.11 385.32 A: i guess so i i've never heard that saying before though about a doctor what was it you have a cold it'll be gone in seven days if you have a if you go to the doctor it'll be gone in a week 

385.23 396.03 B: yeah that's right ah well actually you know what that was funny 'cause i'm taking ah i'm taking micro biology ah i i just took micro biology and i my professor that was her favorite phrase 

385.39 386.67 A: did they say that on 

395.44 398.00 A: oh really 'cause i've never heard that one before 

397.77 401.11 B: yeah it it's pretty funny eh 'cause i was ah [lipsmack] 

401.69 406.85 B: [mn] i'm actually going i'm actually about going back to school for nursing so i was 

406.13 407.40 A: oh cool 

406.89 410.90 B: so we took ah i took micro biology you know 'cause that's a pre req- and 

410.16 411.14 A: sure 

410.93 423.77 B: then you know [laughter] that was her big thing you know if you you know go go to the doctor it you know if it take if if you have cold it's five to seven days go to the doctor it's a week so it was pretty funny when i heard that i was cracking up 

417.12 417.68 A: (( [cough] )) 

421.06 422.05 A: [laughter] 

423.15 429.30 A: it depends if it's yeah that must be funny for you it depends on if it's bacterial or not though if it's bacterial it doesn't really 

427.20 428.11 B: yeah 

429.67 438.71 A: you know i mean it you can get rid of it almost immediately with a good antibiotic it just depends on how you diagnose it you know if you got a fever you better go see a doctor 

433.11 434.24 B: that's true 

434.84 436.22 B: that's true 

439.01 444.80 A: well that's actually that's the ironic part if you if you've got a fever it's more important and you need to see a physician 

444.62 454.34 A: but then they can't do anything if it's viral but then if you don't have a fever it's most likely bacterial and then they can do something so either way you're kind of screwed 

446.05 446.95 B: (( [noise] that's )) 

453.05 462.82 B: well yeah ex- except isn't that if you have if your fever is like under a certain level it's better not to do anything about it because it's probably just killing of the bacteria 

462.35 472.52 A: oh yeah probably well usually bacterial infections don't come with a fever unless they're you know based on surgery or something like that you know but you'll you'll be aware of what's going on then 

466.93 468.45 B: right yeah 

472.10 483.65 B: oh yeah [laughter] i know we ah i i we saw a lot of that with the um you know incubating everything in if you're temperature you know like oh my god this e. coli grows at this great you know 

483.00 486.75 A: yeah like you've got sars roaming through you at this point [mn] 

485.95 488.20 B: [laughter] oh i know well that's 

488.54 489.44 B: [mn] that's 

489.49 492.37 B: that's that's a fun one sars so i i wonder 

491.38 493.39 A: it's overblown 

493.00 501.49 B: yeah oh yeah i mean because the amount of people who actually die from it you know or or have something compromised is you know minimal at best 

496.72 498.67 A: yeah 

500.88 507.64 A: exactly i i think it's just i my attitude towards it is it's scary because it could explode 

507.48 521.57 A: ah and become a big deal you know like ah they just wanna contain it so it doesn't ever really spread but the the actual illness itself isn't all that bad i mean it's not that huge a deal you know it's not like aids or anything 

518.73 519.46 B: (( [mn] )) 

520.75 524.67 B: yeah i mean the panic from it is probably worse than the 

524.94 527.07 B: than the disease itself 

526.39 533.52 A: oh yeah oh yeah well i'm on a i'm on a immunosuppressant right now myself so it's like i couldn't really go to hong kong i'd be pretty screwed 

532.29 538.94 B: [laughter] yeah [mn] ah i mean [mn] now there's so many things you can't take anything for with immuno- 

533.82 534.63 A: um 

539.11 543.85 B: there's so many things that contra- cont- contraindicated you know with immunosuppressants 

539.95 540.96 A: (( ah )) 

543.33 546.88 A: oh yeah i know it i i have crohn's disease so 

546.66 548.33 B: oh okay yeah 

547.34 551.63 A: so yeah so i take an immunosuppressant that helps out with that 

550.85 555.01 B: yeah i know a couple of people with crohn's that's that's coming up a lot 

554.40 567.20 A: right yeah it's because people are starting to talk about it the incidence rate's actually really really high it's just that people haven't been too aware of it it's one of those things where i'd never really heard i mean well i heard about it in med school but you know not in the public literature all that much 

564.18 565.42 B: (( yeah [mn] [mn] )) 

567.12 581.86 A: and then once i got it and then started talking to people about it everybody's like oh i know somebody with that like everybody i know knows somebody with it so it's kind of strange that ah it's it's as common as it is i didn't really realise it had such a high incidence in the population 

580.60 586.02 B: yeah i was gonna say 'cause that's what more people are immunosuppressants for crohn's than for anything right now 

585.71 593.65 A: yeah i mean and the medication you take is ah well one of the medications you can take anyway is the same as you take for ah leukemia purenathol 

592.76 594.82 B: yeah yeah 

594.17 596.36 A: so it's like great you know 

595.72 597.29 B: [laughter] 

596.44 599.89 A: you know i walk outside and i just get sick now it sucks but i mean i'm
