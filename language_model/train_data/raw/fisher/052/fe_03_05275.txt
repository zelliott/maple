0.40 1.47 A: hello 

0.45 2.04 B: hi my name is jordan 

1.96 5.33 A: mine is david how are you pretty well and you 

3.14 4.55 B: how's it going 

4.92 6.79 B: (( pretty good )) 

6.22 7.91 A: good 

7.27 9.16 B: [mn] so where are 

8.11 10.95 A: so we're supposed to talk about iraq 

10.69 12.57 B: i guess so yeah 

13.06 15.39 A: [mn] do you have ah any thoughts or opinions 

16.25 17.89 B: um 

18.83 22.21 B: i don't know [lipsmack] i think it's not a bad idea [mn] 

22.38 23.51 B: i guess 

22.40 23.47 A: to 

24.17 25.15 B: to 

24.20 26.50 A: to disarm it 

26.29 29.56 B: yeah you know i haven't 

30.24 39.46 B: really i don't know now understand that there might not be any weapons there but i find that hard to believe kind of you know myself 

38.17 39.10 A: mhm 

39.48 41.88 B: but i don't i don't think it's a great 

43.99 47.32 B: way to live for those people as it was so 

47.28 48.06 A: (( ahah )) 

47.66 51.85 B: you know i don't know about war but you know it's kind of one of those [mn] 

52.83 56.43 B: inbetween i guess what do you think about it 

55.61 62.48 A: well um i mean if you had ah asked me before the war started i mean i would have ah i would have said that um 

63.14 69.09 A: it it would almost be a certainty that they had some sort of weapons of mass destruction and they're doing all that so 

69.48 70.60 A: um [cough] 

70.97 76.49 A: it's interesting that they haven't found any since then considering all the the evidence that they were supposed to have had beforehand 

76.22 77.59 B: yeah [mn] 

76.65 80.80 A: um i think it's um it's being a little hypocritical 

81.30 87.53 A: ah to go in saying that the reason that we're doing it is for the weapons of mass destruction and then 

87.65 102.60 A: ah [mn] almost immediately in mind of the fact that we haven't found any they changed it to the focus is now freeing the people of iraq ah when so that that now being what seems to be hid- held up as the primary purpose 

94.36 95.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

95.82 96.91 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

102.84 113.29 A: there are all these countries in the world many of them worse off than iraq that we make no efforts to do anything with and so that leaves it sort of circumspect that 

113.39 125.21 A: it's it's not the weapons or at least that we haven't found yet we're doing it to save the people but it seems obvious that it's more than that and oil's probably one of the major issues oil and retaliation for 

117.14 118.95 B: mhm 

125.22 127.22 A: ah the past ten years or so 

125.52 126.73 B: yeah 

127.28 131.55 B: yeah [mn] yeah i don't [mn] i heard the other day 

131.82 134.68 B: that um that they've only 

134.90 138.22 B: um looked at thirty percent of the sites 

138.00 139.18 A: mhm 

138.54 141.05 B: the chemical weapon sites so i don't know 

141.12 146.90 B: if it's just bad luck they haven't found any yet or [laughter] who knows [noise] 

144.82 157.77 A: well but you would think based on i mean you know we've got all these satellites and we we they're doing all these recon ah operations before the war started and they had all this evidence that supposedly should have proven 

157.60 164.43 A: you know before they even started that they knew you know the president and the top you know senate panels and everything they were supposed to know where these are 

164.19 165.15 B: mhm 

164.52 169.26 A: and if they had seen them you would assume that they would also track them and so 

167.83 168.76 B: right 

169.45 180.63 A: th- it may be true that they've only looked at thirty percent but those thirty percent should have been the ones that had you know eighty percent of the you know the evidence that they had found 

180.09 181.81 B: right 'cause they would know 

180.41 187.10 A: and so the other seventy percent were just you know other sites that might have had something and so i mean you know 

185.46 186.79 B: yeah 

187.47 197.23 A: i i think it- it's it's possible and likely that ah there was stuff and they were moved to places that are less obvious to look for but at the same time 

194.70 195.68 B: mhm 

197.36 204.42 A: if we really had evidence from the beginning we would have been tracking them because you know they could have used it against our troops 

204.36 205.51 B: right 

204.51 208.90 A: and so that that would have been military ah information that they would have 

208.86 220.52 A: needed to keep track of and so i think in mind of the fact that they haven't found it they didn't have it in the first place because otherwise they would have been tracking it this whole time to make sure that they it wasn't used against our troops 

220.71 221.27 B: [mn] 

220.78 221.65 A: so 

221.70 224.09 B: n- did they have it 

222.38 223.39 A: i i ju- 

223.88 225.46 A: mhm 

224.76 226.80 B: did they have it the first time 

227.04 228.49 A: the in the first war 

228.37 229.47 B: yeah 

229.20 230.98 A: ah they well i mean 

229.94 230.71 B: for the 

231.39 241.34 A: the ah gulf war syndrome is they're still debating on what what exactly caused that ah but ah to my the best of my recollection 

233.75 235.37 B: (( yeah mm )) 

241.24 246.51 A: they didn't ostensibly use any chemicals or anything against our troops 

246.34 247.55 B: right 

246.70 253.06 A: th- the best ah case of that was when they they dropped the ah chemical stuff on the kurdish um people 

251.92 253.20 B: yeah 

253.03 266.26 A: and so we know that they have used them and therefore they had to have had them um and i think that ah you know the arguments are pretty good that well we know that they've had them since the gulf war which meant that you know they were in breach of what they were supposed to be doing anyway 

256.48 257.69 B: right 

266.31 275.43 A: ah and they evidently ah you know they keep tra- records of everything you know like you move a paper p- paper clip from one desk to another and they had paperwork for it 

275.40 276.70 B: right 

275.43 289.09 A: and so they should have had evidence that they destroyed it and so i think that's a good argument for saying yes there probably was ah storages of of materials ah in all likelihood they were moved somewhere secretly um 

288.94 295.53 A: 'cause like i said i mean i i never doubted that there was some stuff there i don't know if i would have thought that it was a 

295.74 306.17 A: ah very large programme if they were developing nuclear or you know i have no idea about that but i don't doubt that they were developing something i think the bigger question in my mind was 

306.09 312.48 A: would it have been something they would have ever used against the united states i think it's more likely they would have used it against israel 

309.63 310.64 B: right 

312.60 323.78 A: ah and maybe you know territorial wars with like iran or kuwait or something like that but ah i think it it's fairly unlikely that any of it we would have ever seen against ah u._s. interests 

317.90 318.87 B: mhm 

323.94 329.86 A: so i mean they didn't even use them in the war with us which would have been the you know the best time for them to use them 

324.16 325.54 B: so do you think 

326.30 327.38 B: right 

329.36 331.34 B: [laughter] what their 

330.01 340.37 A: and so if they're not using 'em there when it was like all or nothing i think it's pretty unlikely that they would have done anything with them anyway from the from the looks of it so 

336.15 337.82 B: [noise] yeah 

339.19 340.13 B: right 

340.51 343.81 B: you think it's our job to go in there and do that [mn] 

343.67 349.29 A: well i i think that ah we we need to draw a line in the sand and say either 

349.06 362.78 A: you know it's our job to do it in which case well we need to do it for everyone so we need to go to burma and ah north korea cuba i mean all these other countries that have dictatorships regimes that you know kill people myanmar 

359.07 360.06 B: right 

362.75 364.34 B: mhm 

362.78 365.46 A: um either we do it for everyone 

365.62 370.48 A: or we don't do it for anybody and i think that it's um i think it's it's gross 

367.37 368.44 B: right 

370.78 383.23 A: ah misuse of power to do it only because you know there's oil there and so it's like oh we're just we're saying that we're doing it for them but in fact it looks like we're doing it for ourselves 

375.85 376.77 B: mhm 

382.40 383.76 B: (( [noise] right )) 

383.14 389.18 A: so i mean either you do it all or you don't do it or or you just say outright well we're doing it because you know 

389.22 394.62 A: by doing this we stabilize the oil and you know we're benefiting us and everyone else in the world that uses oil 

389.48 390.79 B: there's oil there 

394.56 395.86 B: yeah 

395.27 398.22 A: i just don't like ah double speak and 

398.33 399.68 B: trying to cover it up 

399.41 405.16 A: ah trying to yeah i mean 'cause it's you know even in the first one it was pretty obvious that you know they were attacking kuwait because 

405.15 416.65 A: as small as it was it had like the third largest oil ah production in the world or something like that and so we knew that if if iraq took that it would have been really bad for ah oil production 

416.77 417.98 A: (( and um )) 

418.09 431.01 A: [mn] i mean so [cough] it seemed pretty clear that that was the cause and especially with this um [lipsmack] wavering back and forth about what was the real reason we went was it weapons of mass destruction was it to free the people of iraq was it to get rid of a dictator 

431.10 438.51 A: you know they never they never did really prove that ah iraq was trying to actually aid any terrorist organizations i mean they 

438.64 446.79 A: they claimed that they were but they still haven't actually given any real conclusive evidence of that ah so um so i mean 

445.36 446.12 B: (( ahah )) 

447.10 455.97 A: the the reason that we did it is still up in the air you know based on what what um what people in leadership have said 

455.84 457.02 B: mhm 

456.47 461.37 A: um so at that point it just becomes speculation from everyone sitting on the sidelines 

461.40 475.50 A: and ah i think the best place to look at the head is just you know the evidence that we've got [mn] unless they say otherwise you know we don't have all the documentation that ah blair and and bush and and ah the other leaders have 

463.96 465.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

465.57 466.42 B: yeah 

475.45 476.38 B: mhm 

475.64 483.79 A: we only have what they tell us and what we see and right now the only thing that we see is that there's nothing you know we no weapons of mass destruction 

483.95 496.17 A: um you know ideologically we're trying to better the lives of the people that are there we haven't been doing a very good job of it yet but you know we knew it was going to take you know a year or more to do that 

491.71 492.72 B: yes 

495.29 496.49 B: right it's 

496.34 506.59 A: um so and and well it was interesting that ah the oil was a top priority from the beginning you know they had special forces go and try to secure the oilfields 

506.43 507.53 B: mhm 

506.52 514.02 A: they were defending the ah department of oil buildings from any type of looting or anything when everything else was ah free for grabs 

513.60 515.04 B: going crazy [mn] 

514.68 521.94 A: yeah yeah i mean they actually had troops there from the very beginning to make sure that n- that no looters went in that building when the the ah 

520.25 521.15 B: (( [noise] )) 

521.95 533.69 A: you know the water the power the energy ah the ministries of every other department were basically left open for looters and ah sometimes actions speak louder than words 

529.88 531.25 B: not oil 

533.28 536.21 B: yeah well it's 

537.26 538.87 B: (( [noise] i )) 

539.16 541.70 B: don't know it's kind of hard to believe that 

542.19 547.61 B: he wasn't doing anything wrong but you know exactly what is another question 

546.11 548.40 A: ah you mean ah hussain 

548.51 550.06 B: yeah sorry 

549.47 558.47 A: oh yeah yeah no i mean ah it [mn] we we know that he was he was doing lots of things wrong i don't think anybody would argue that ah 

555.19 556.86 B: (( yeah )) 

558.98 560.12 A: (( it's ah )) 

560.79 564.32 A: it's it's tough to know for sure without all the information 

562.26 563.67 B: (( yeah )) 

564.53 567.08 B: exactly [laughter] 

565.32 568.86 A: [cough] well 'specially [cough] it's interesting that we don't know where he's at now 

569.04 571.56 B: yeah now do they 

571.62 575.20 B: say that he's still alive i haven't kept up on it lately so 

573.82 589.42 A: well th- i heard there's speculation you know they had this very recent ah insurgency there's like a triangle that was held by sunni muslims and ah there was some speculation that he might be ah heading up the operations there that were causing you know the recent aggression 

581.87 582.81 B: mhm 

589.46 590.34 B: (( right )) 

589.65 590.82 A: but um 

590.65 591.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

591.26 597.88 A: i i heard you know just as many people counting that that's unlikely there would have been some word of him or something so 

597.96 598.77 B: oh 

598.83 599.89 B: (( yeah i don't ))
