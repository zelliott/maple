138.34 151.72 B: yeah i mean i my my views on smoking have changed so dramatically over like the last year like um i used to not care at all like i used to smoke and go crazy and stuff but i mean i guess now now that i've been smoking for a long time i 

151.88 152.97 B: um

196.76 202.88 B: yeah yeah 

199.79 202.84 A: um let's see what else 

203.26 204.56 A: (( ah )) 

205.31 213.48 A: do you think that um like any of these things are tied together necessarily like smoking and drinking 

211.37 212.86 B: um 

213.81 218.44 B: oh yeah definitely i mean i i think that um i mean the reason 

218.26 230.18 B: they way i got into smoking was just by hanging out and drinking and then like just picking up a cigarette and and you know then i was just smoking more and more and then i didn't really care so i just smoked more 

221.89 222.77 A: uh-huh 

230.22 234.32 A: do you ever like feel bad if you're smoking a cigarette and like ah 

234.36 239.54 A: you see someone that maybe you want to give them a different first impression of 

239.09 244.19 B: oh yeah absolutely i think the worst is like is smelling like cigarettes 

243.83 244.71 A: (( you )) 

244.24 247.30 B: and like going into like i don't know 

247.62 254.61 B: like a class or something at some point or going to work and like you know somebody doesn't smoke or like you know 

254.43 266.39 B: like i have two jobs right now but like one of them is like retail so like like if somebody comes in like and you know like i had one person ask me do you smoke and i'm like yes you know and like you know 

263.27 264.46 A: yeah 

266.47 280.82 B: i mean i feel i mean like with all this stuff i mean like you know i feel discriminated against because it's just kind of funny um which is funny i i don't feel like i mean suppose like if i was really like 

266.76 267.66 A: (( mhm right )) 

281.00 285.26 B: it's funny like smoking versus like overeating or something like that and like 

285.03 298.53 B: if somebody was like you know discriminating against me because i was like being a pig or something like that i would feel i wouldn't feel as bad about that you know like you know i don't when i when i do overeat or something like that as opposed to like when i'm smoking 

298.57 300.11 A: mhm 

298.91 300.68 B: (( but )) 

300.39 302.16 A: um 

302.30 311.69 A: yeah wh- [laughter] actually i was ah one situation that was surprising to me i was working um 

303.08 304.61 B: yeah 

311.79 316.27 A: at a ski area where all of the employees were you know 

316.19 328.22 A: athletes because we had to just ski all the time um and you would expect them to be healthy at least while they're on the slopes but almost everyone there smoked cigarettes constantly 

318.83 321.18 B: mhm 

327.41 330.06 B: (( oh re- well yeah )) 

328.90 332.08 A: and ah i found that real surprising 

331.59 335.93 B: yeah i played rugby and like i mean like i was you know 

335.84 346.68 B: everyone's like yeah i mean everyone tries to keep like fit the most part and everything but i mean like everyone drinks really heavily everyone smokes a lot of people smoke pot and stuff so i mean 

343.89 345.34 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

346.18 347.93 A: right 

346.82 348.75 B: yeah 

348.14 352.91 A: um let's see what else your parents know that you smoke 

352.62 358.13 B: um my dad does my mom doesn't i think my mom would flip out 

355.83 357.05 A: yeah 

357.48 362.91 A: yeah no my parents [cough] would expect that i wouldn't you know be 

362.16 367.44 B: oh yeah i mean my parents don't know that i drink as much as i do either but 

366.24 373.83 A: yeah sometimes i feel guilty about the smoking because it's so explicitly understood how bad it is 

373.12 379.60 B: yeah yeah but i mean i guess i figure like these days for some reason like um 

379.85 386.82 B: i don't know younger kids these days just don't i mean they don't seem to care as much honestly like i see so many smokers around me 

386.53 387.44 A: yeah 

386.86 398.44 B: like um as far like i guess maybe like in another generation like you know the seventies sixties seventies and then stuff like that it kind of died down for a little bit and even the eighties are just kind of like 

398.24 411.24 B: like really early eighties i don't know like the people who were young adults then were just didn't smoke so much but i think smoking's come back big yeah and

457.04 471.83 A: no really i'm i'm going to stay away from that sometimes i do things like when i was younger like in high school and i would ah buy packs of cigarettes i would have these ah feelings of guilt and like throw the pack away when it was when i hadn't finished it 

457.49 459.38 B: yeah 

461.91 463.94 B: (( mhm )) 

470.68 479.19 B: oh yeah absolutely that i i i do that every once and like if i you know like i start smoking a cigarette and i just put it out or something because of a guilt complex

525.06 530.05 B: yeah i really dislike that about america actually like the people are 

530.10 544.15 B: i don't know it but people would discriminate more on um you know i guess like overeating and and stuff like that or like they feel more like i feel even like it's more acceptable to to criticize against that for some reason but i mean like 

543.31 545.04 A: yeah

571.57 586.54 A: ah you know it didn't really bother me but sometimes i wonder what the the people their kids ah what's going to happen with them i hate i i really don't like um when parents indulge their kids to the point that the kids are fat
