143.56 147.06 B: and ah w- what was that that seven days thing 

146.55 160.52 A: well i guess i guess what they're trying to say is that there's a saying that if if you go to see a doctor ah a cold'll last a week if you don't it'll last for seven days in other words it lasts the same time amount of time regardless of whether you go to the doctor or not 

160.41 161.21 B: oh 

161.22 170.72 B: um yeah yeah i guess i agree with that because yeah i mean there's no cure for a common cold and they'll just they'll just tell you take you know medicine get some sleep and stuff you know
