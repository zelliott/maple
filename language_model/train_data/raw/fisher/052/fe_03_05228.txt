124.77 127.57 A: sets them up and makes them more subject to um 

127.72 135.44 A: some kind of illness if it comes around i'm kind of wondering if it affects their ah immunity i don't know but i'm just thinking 

135.36 147.46 B: i see and it's a you mean it's dehydration and and you're exposed to to all kinds of illnesses ah here we have have plenty maybe maybe too much of water and ah

162.34 171.91 B: i- i- i- in any way um because um this is this is not only ah i mean water is one thing but but ah 

171.91 182.88 B: too much heat is is bad for the heart and the lungs and everything i mean there are more probably more cases of heart diseases ah people diagnosed with this in 

182.94 186.83 B: when it's that hot do you do you find that to be true 

187.49 190.10 A: i think so um considering um 

190.99 193.14 A: it's dangerous to get 

193.35 195.70 A: when it's hot you can 

194.47 195.42 B: (( mm )) 

195.72 196.84 A: you can get 

197.42 199.85 A: i think ah heat exposure 

200.01 201.70 A: can be fatal 

201.40 216.10 B: yeah it can be very very very very very bad and fatal even in some cases yes ah particularly for you know for athletes you know for you know there there there have been cases of athletes 

201.92 203.25 A: that is 

216.48 220.46 B: ah just just just dying because you know the ah 

220.74 222.20 B: exposed to heat 

222.30 225.60 B: (( and ah ah s- )) 

225.47 238.49 B: anyway and even if ah you know the the consequences are not that bad ah i mean people go and to see the doctor more often than they normally do than they normally have to 

238.90 246.52 B: and ah it's not always good i think i think ah [laughter] there is one aspect that ah 

246.59 258.74 B: ah i find ah i find not not not not so good you know when you go to the to the doctor oftener than you have to you just become not sure of your own 

258.71 263.14 B: resources of your own vitality you know wh- what i mean 

263.19 269.36 B: and it it makes you so much dependent on on on the medical profession and it's um 

269.57 278.43 B: i think it it turns into a bad habit if if nothing more damaging happens do you think that that's the case 

278.45 279.77 A: i would think so 

279.85 282.05 B: (( yeah ah how old are you john ))

440.06 442.83 A: yes i think that health is high um 

442.22 446.52 B: yes it's high on the on the um on the list and high on the agenda too 

446.72 455.87 B: and um wh- wh- what what what do you do what what kind of stuff do you use when you um when you catch cold or something 

455.86 465.69 A: if i need 'em i usually use like things like triaminic or robotussin if and only if i need them i don't like to use 'em

465.89 468.84 A: without a real need for 'em 

468.96 476.45 B: i see well that's that's that's that's a good policy because you know again it does not make us dependent on those ah 

476.67 486.86 B: ah on those drugs and and stuff and ah not dependent on doctors but there are cases when you have to ah take some medication right 

486.23 487.49 A: yeah there are

508.86 512.35 B: ah to work it to work it out by itself 

512.72 525.93 B: ah which may be true in some cases but not in all cases but do you have among your friends or or those people who you know ah who stick to this to this rule or 

526.14 528.29 B: is it is it kind of exception 

526.14 527.93 A: i think i've got a couple

550.79 552.81 B: it's actually um 

553.16 563.11 B: with with all the stuff that our our body does by itself ah it's um yeah it's getting rid of those diseases but 

563.10 575.70 B: but but most of them and in most situations but not always but these people i find them they're so stubborn they ah i mean they refuse to see how critical the situation may be 

575.68 588.80 B: ah because you know they have this rule and they stick to it and sometimes i feel they they it does more harm than it does good you see it may not do all that good that they're
