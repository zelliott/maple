1.02 3.48 A: hi this is don in san diego 

3.15 4.55 B: (( hey how're you doing man )) 

4.29 6.84 A: okay where are you calling from 

5.18 6.16 B: (( all right )) 

6.62 7.84 B: (( los angeles )) 

7.50 8.85 A: (( los angeles )) 

9.21 14.14 A: yeah this ah particular topic is one i was discussing with my wife about an hour ago 

13.67 15.29 B: yeah mm okay 

14.19 17.01 A: and i said that ah we can't 

17.24 20.64 A: we can't stop now and ah we're in too deep 

21.09 24.67 A: and we've got to watch them and watch iran as well 

24.87 27.07 A: (( because the ah )) 

27.55 31.01 A: the the terrorism situation is not going away 

31.44 34.34 A: i don't know where the money is coming from but ah 

34.80 37.86 A: oh i got an idea and it seems that ah the 

38.00 40.97 A: killing of more people is going on 

41.30 52.89 A: and ah it's it's not stopping i don't i think the u._s. could do more in the way of maybe providing jobs and water and hospitalization and ah medical things 

53.13 57.11 A: but beyond that ah it's a troubled country 

57.70 58.80 B: (( [mn] i )) 

57.79 61.17 A: and ah this this ah it's just starting 

61.59 65.31 B: agree with what you say that we're in too deep to just pull out now 

61.62 62.34 A: (( i )) 

65.10 66.90 A: yeah yeah but 

65.70 68.00 B: oh you can't do that 

67.39 77.14 A: i kinda think that ah at some point we had to do this because ah not so much as saddam hussain i i don't think he 

77.18 84.75 A: had what we ah all thought he did personally but ah i think that ah that whole area is such a hotbed of 

84.83 89.89 A: and i think religion ah religion is ah behind it that particular religion 

90.34 91.54 A: (( and ah )) 

91.56 97.01 A: it's ah it's a problem there's been more wars in the name of religion than any other thing 

97.21 102.32 A: and this one in particular now it's the palestinians and the ah israelis 

102.66 107.67 A: i don't ah as far back as i can remember they've been fighting and 

106.74 108.59 B: right exactly 

107.91 111.88 A: and i don't even know who's wrong any more who's right or who's wrong 

111.12 113.76 B: right right it doesn't even seem to matter 

113.62 120.81 A: you know something every time i watch television and i and i see all these guys like my age in the street i wonder what're they doing for work 

121.31 122.52 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

122.10 123.19 B: right 

123.45 125.23 A: how can they be in the street 

124.90 126.06 B: (( right )) 

125.47 128.95 A: i mean if i could be in the street all the time i i couldn't be working 

128.54 130.14 B: [mn] exactly 

129.51 133.76 A: it's amazing to me that ah they're constantly ah 

133.95 139.96 A: in the street ah available for ah whatever parade or something like that and kids 

138.94 140.45 B: that is their job 

140.56 143.17 A: kids i can understand but not grown men 

142.80 144.81 B: it seems like that is their job 

144.66 148.25 A: it maybe is a job they may be getting paid you know 

148.64 151.95 A: but i think that ah the country if you look at it is like 

152.13 154.03 A: sand and rubble 

154.37 163.03 A: and you see the pictures of the hospitals not only the united states television but b._b._c. too and they're very good they're not as biased as we are 

162.79 164.15 B: (( right right )) 

163.34 168.75 A: and ah they show the lack of medication and things like that for children 

169.00 174.26 A: i don't think children have anything to do with the war politically so why make them suffer 

174.24 175.95 B: (( well you know what that is that's )) 

174.43 175.33 A: (( you know you know )) 

176.30 177.91 B: for years to come 

178.35 183.01 A: yeah well we'll be paying for this war for years to come 

179.09 180.84 B: see that's what 

182.39 186.11 B: oh yeah sure but also we'll be profiting from this war too 

186.12 189.05 A: well i hope so but in what way do you think 

188.47 190.27 B: ah the oil 

190.21 193.05 A: yeah well i hope they do that because ah 

193.30 198.07 A: i know that france was in there getting her nose in and so was ah russia 

195.95 196.96 B: right 

198.58 202.12 A: and putin turned out to be a rat as far as i'm concerned 

201.54 209.78 B: right i think that ah he did have the weapons of mass destruction or he would have let us in immediately 

209.47 212.58 A: yeah that's true you know he 

211.23 212.11 B: you know 

212.81 215.93 B: if he had nothing to hide why why not just open the door 

212.91 214.30 A: i think that 

216.23 217.46 A: yeah 

216.94 217.83 B: you know 

217.92 220.79 A: (( but i i kind of think that ah )) 

221.06 230.73 A: maybe ah bush junior tried to be a popular president by winning a war that probably any country could have won 

230.29 231.56 B: yeah plus 

232.00 234.95 B: he wanted he needs the oil he's a oil man 

234.67 237.66 A: yeah he he does need the oil yeah 

236.55 240.66 B: and it's it's big business and look at the company ah halliburton 

240.64 241.85 A: yeah 

241.35 245.33 B: halliburton's over there and that's the vice president's company 

244.86 247.46 A: and that's a big big money outfit 

246.90 251.54 B: right that's that you know it's a big money outfit's an understatement they ah 

250.84 260.39 A: you know ah a few years back i put a lot of money into it ah took a second mortgage out on my house and everything to put into this ah [lipsmack] ah 

261.33 263.78 A: oh what the hell this fuel cell thing you know 

263.44 264.73 B: right 

264.16 268.23 A: and i got in with a direct company i can't reca- ballard that was the name of it 

267.96 268.92 B: (( mm-kay )) 

268.32 274.84 A: and ah now i find out that ah they're putting it off they say it may take decades 

275.09 284.34 A: well all of a sudden ah bush gets in there and i guess maybe the guys behind the gas stations and the oil and the what have you the infrastructure that's existing now 

284.40 285.87 A: probably 

286.18 294.97 A: said hey ah you know we we want you in there to keep the situation ah as it is you know so we can make money but if fuel cells come in 

291.70 292.73 B: right 

295.10 297.42 A: we'll be out you know 

296.47 298.43 B: (( exactly exactly mm )) 

297.90 303.13 A: so ah if all the fuel cell admitted was water vapor 

303.46 308.76 A: well that seems to me to be a good thing rather than 

308.88 313.14 A: kill the the fish and the water and the air and every other damn thing 

313.34 316.28 B: and i think you know what else is a shame 

313.77 314.58 A: so it 

316.51 319.55 B: ah i think they need to rotate soldiers more 

320.25 323.00 A: (( yeah yeah that's been a [mn] )) 

321.19 329.95 B: to me th- everybody need everybody needs to do their share over there everybody that signed up you know just signing up for it's no problem you know 

330.14 334.04 B: ah you need to do six months a year then get out of there 

334.01 344.31 A: why d- why are they killing our guys now why i it was a shock to hear that th- they they stopped they said ah one guy in the car said he was sick in the car and they walked over there and they got shot 

343.96 347.99 B: you know what they're doing that's they're sympathizers 

348.49 349.76 A: (( you think )) 

349.19 351.37 B: yeah that's sympathizers and it's 

351.68 353.11 B: (( you know ah )) 

353.30 354.64 B: (( [lipsmack] it's )) 

355.06 358.87 B: (( that's what makes it so dangerous you know i i i work in a oil field )) 

359.03 361.88 B: and i could go over there and do work 

361.84 363.13 A: mhm 

362.57 365.20 B: but and make very good money 

364.76 368.87 A: oh i know they can a buddy of mine worked overseas for three years 

368.43 373.51 B: but i'm scared to do that because i'm over there minding my business say digging a hole one day 

373.93 375.81 B: and somebody could come by in 

375.86 379.26 B: a jeep and just blow us and themselves up and 

378.52 382.47 A: well sure especially if you're with the u._s._a. and you're taking their oil 

382.18 386.94 B: and they don't look at you as being black or white or whatever they just look at u._s._a. 

388.52 393.16 A: yeah i don't i don't think it's an ethnic issue i think it's with them it's ah 

392.90 394.52 B: just u._s._a. period 

394.16 401.85 A: they hate the u._s._a. and they hate the lifestyle we have and ah if you look around at their country ah 

395.27 396.08 B: yeah 

402.06 408.36 A: i i don't know about you but i couldn't last much ah longer with ah just looking at sand and sit 

407.35 410.18 B: no i couldn't live over there no way [laughter] 

409.46 412.53 A: sit in a cement block house with one room 

412.14 413.95 B: no i know th- 

412.64 414.26 A: you know i'd go nuts 

413.97 416.02 B: yeah there's no way in hell i could 

416.18 424.39 B: you know i i could i could only go over there to work and i would still have to have things from america over there to keep me occupied when i'm not working 

423.78 425.90 A: yeah what would you do at nights yeah 

425.31 429.07 B: right sit up there and look at ah tarantulas or something like that 

427.94 431.61 A: you can't even there's no t._v. is there or is there 

430.20 431.10 B: (( no )) 

431.40 434.72 B: or i- if it is t._v. you watch what they want you to watch 

434.14 435.81 A: yeah one channel 

435.21 436.59 B: yeah 

435.96 438.33 A: osama bin laden reruns 

437.73 440.16 B: (( all night long [mn] yeah yeah )) 

439.66 442.73 A: all night long jesus christ but that 

440.46 441.38 B: yeah 

441.49 444.68 B: and i think his money is well connected 

444.89 451.28 B: in the east coast like in new jersey ah massachusetts the university of massachusetts ah 

448.34 448.90 A: (( [mn] )) 

451.75 458.20 A: well another the one thing that gets me too is oh what was it ah seventeen out of the nineteen 

451.82 452.54 B: you 

458.51 463.44 A: ah that were doing the destruction that they did on ah nine eleven were 

463.50 465.08 A: saudi arabians 

464.75 466.66 B: right 

465.60 470.20 A: and um they got paid and um they all got the same thing 

470.30 475.03 A: twenty five thousand dollars and what was it twenty five virgins 

474.84 476.86 B: (( yeah something like that )) 

475.82 489.24 A: and yet th- they they traced them and then a few nights before they were in atlantic city watching the chicks you know with the the dancers ah you know and that kind of crap so they're not really really being true to their religion 

485.46 486.68 B: yeah 

488.86 490.74 B: no they're not they're not 

489.76 491.58 A: it's all mouth you know 

491.23 492.80 B: once they get over here 

493.10 495.35 B: they would take that money and run 

495.19 498.44 A: yeah i think i think if they could 

495.83 496.70 B: but 

497.89 502.93 B: yeah they'd take their money and live in florida and open a beer bar or 

503.29 509.99 B: some other store for the rest of their life but they've already been obligated and they know that they would get killed anyway 

507.02 507.95 A: yeah 

510.08 514.20 A: yeah i think so it's a it's a very very strange and ah 

514.24 526.92 A: i think a lot of them suffer from some sort of depression like it's they don't have any goals they don't have anything to look forward to it seems maybe i'm wrong but ah you know you look around there's no 

526.98 532.86 A: the roads aren't paved they there's no cars there to speak of ah what the hell do you have to l- 

531.60 532.90 B: well they never they 

532.91 537.38 B: never been introduced to anything better so they don't want anything better 

537.40 543.05 A: but you know they they do have some t._v. and they see enough to resent our lifestyle 

542.48 548.35 B: that's what it is it's more resentment because they can't get hold to it and live it their way 

548.49 552.08 B: so they don't you know they- they'd rather be against it they're brainwashed 

552.10 556.57 A: yeah ah they they certainly are they h- how the hell can you pray five times a day 

556.38 561.60 B: (( [mn] but ah hold it now i'll tell you who wasn't brainwashed i hussain wasn't brainwashed ))

566.13 569.77 A: (( he he used them fairly well he really did )) 

569.30 571.28 B: right he lived to the 

570.03 572.21 A: (( i mean that's why it's t- )) 

572.27 574.42 A: seven castles did he have 

573.87 575.57 B: yeah castles
