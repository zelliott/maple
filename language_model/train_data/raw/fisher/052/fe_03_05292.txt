22.86 24.66 A: chemicals and stuff 

23.92 25.42 B: right 

25.16 26.05 A: what do you 

26.47 31.58 B: (( w- well i i think what we're doing is uh )) 

28.09 32.47 A: (( think )) 

31.81 38.07 B: telling the world very clearly that uh we won't put up with terrorism uh 

35.12 36.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

38.35 44.41 B: they've bombed out the world trade centre huh and we've uh 

44.42 51.89 B: wiped out two armies as a result in afghanistan and uh iraq

59.80 60.80 B: (( well [mn] )) 

62.54 72.09 A: we've done that already but what can we do to uh prevent it from happening out here you know my my you know what i think 

72.01 83.38 A: i would think that we would have to go with all the foreigner businesses liquor stores any type of little stores that they have and uh put restrictions on them because right there that's how they can get to you 

83.79 86.57 A: because a lot of them own businesses 

86.22 88.17 B: (( well yeah )) 

86.75 88.13 A: (( you understand what i'm saying )) 

88.63 90.88 B: but uh amer- 

89.91 102.73 A: cigarettes people are the the the the daily things that americans buy are right up in these stores and uh with bin laden having all the type of money he has i don't think he'd have a problem you know 

103.37 105.95 A: [noise] working with them 

106.31 113.10 B: well i don't know i think we get a lot of interested people uh to suffer 

106.38 107.94 A: (( what do you think about that one )) 

112.02 126.06 A: well you well you have to watch ev- you notice that a lot of people are innocent and a lot aren't you know how can we we you you can't just pick them no one knows anyone so therefore to be safe let's just deal with the whole situation 

125.29 133.70 B: well that sounds like what we did in world war two when we put all the japanese in con- -centration camps 

131.78 137.51 A: [noise] well it worked i- it worked and it prevented some other uh things happening 

138.21 149.15 B: well i don't [mn] i'd rather do things like uh increase the border patrol increase the customs 

146.02 152.86 A: well you can increase the border patrol as much as you can it still seemed d- that the seem still seems not to work 

153.01 154.06 B: (( well )) 

154.80 160.00 B: uh my experience is that the 

160.62 162.85 B: our government reacts 

162.91 167.74 B: to things that they don't uh have the best border patrol be- 

167.83 172.56 B: in the past because they didn't need it they didn't have the best immigration 

172.61 179.92 B: control because they didn't need it now they need it and they've reorganized and they have 

179.02 181.58 A: [noise] why are the drugs still coming in 

182.15 186.26 B: well i guess people want drugs uh 

185.48 194.25 A: yes but if they weren't here they wouldn't have to use them th- the those things come from a third world country [noise] we're supposed to be in a safe environment right now 

188.27 189.86 B: (( [laughter] )) 

194.79 200.74 B: [mn] yeah but people want drugs that's just like saying alcohol 

195.03 196.39 A: (( you understand what i'm saying )) 

198.49 204.12 A: i don't care how bad you want it they ain't over here you won't be getting them 

202.60 205.98 B: uh that's what people said about prohibition 

205.89 218.48 B: and it made uh more criminal elements get involved with alcohol and drinking and gambling and prostitution that went with the excesses 

217.35 224.97 A: [laughter] 

218.65 219.61 B: (( um )) 

219.77 228.44 B: the we learnt we should have learnt from that that if you want to stop something you have to educate the people not to do it 

228.44 235.95 B: because they banned liquor and they sold more liquor during prohibition than before and after well 

232.33 233.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

236.17 239.14 A: but you didn't have as much alcoholics back then [noise] 

239.86 245.76 A: now that they made it legal you got a ton of alcoholics on your hand people killing people driving cars and stuff so 

246.00 248.03 B: they did it then 

246.29 247.89 A: i can't agree with that one [noise] 

248.11 249.63 A: (( uh-huh )) 

248.97 250.24 B: i think they 

249.80 253.65 A: (( [noise] well )) 

250.25 263.39 B: did that same amount of drinking and driving uh proportionately as the as now maybe uh everybody drives more including people that drink but 

263.40 264.56 B: uh 

263.93 269.31 A: they got uh statistics that say i think uh a drunk driver hit somebody uh every what hour or two 

269.29 276.68 B: yeah well that's because we got a a lot more people driving now than we did back in the nineteen twenties 

276.27 283.40 A: well we got a lot more people uh doing uh giving up um fuck started a fight and still they say a fight breaks out on alcohol every 

283.28 294.04 A: twenty two minutes so they didn't have quite that's because there's more of it out there and it's legal [noise] you understand what i'm saying 

285.72 286.85 B: (( well )) 

292.93 296.06 B: yeah i hear what you're saying but i don't [laughter] 

293.92 300.17 A: well that's how but that's i think i think the only way to prevent this bio hazard situation is 

300.21 300.77 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

300.86 308.27 A: to take these peop- these people they come from their country i know you're here and stuff but a lot you can't trust anyone 

308.53 312.26 A: trust is our big problem we trust too many people 

312.34 315.41 A: and you trust people and problems happen 

315.29 328.46 A: key uh key to this don't trust anyone do it like world war two and put people in concentration camps if they want to go back home go back home and to but until we deal with this this is what's going 

329.03 330.63 A: (( on you understand what i'm saying [noise] )) 

330.72 332.83 B: yeah [mn] i d- 

331.80 341.87 A: and no re- and not actually steal anything from them take the get their markets and it money they've invested give it back to them and americans the government 'cause that's how they going to get to us 

342.06 346.56 A: they can w- w- the ti- i remember about six months ago i w- i would buy cigarettes 

346.48 359.05 A: and the cigarettes had a different taste they were marlboros but they had a different taste whenever i went to these certain type of people's stores 'cause they own a lot of them 'specially out here where i live where do you live [noise]

452.29 454.88 A: (( [noise] )) 

455.30 457.28 B: (( discount stores )) 

456.46 468.76 A: okay i guess it's a little bit different around out there than it is out here but i know how they can get get us out here and i know how to prevent it too [noise] 'cause that's the way they going to come at you with the least thing that you could expect

465.04 465.92 B: (( oh )) 

469.28 477.25 A: and so many of these people own liquor stores i wouldn't be surprised if bin laden hadn't of backed them with the down payment to open them 'cause the gang um own them out here 

478.36 485.05 A: so that's my theory we buy our liquor there our beer there never know what they could be doing up to that stuff
