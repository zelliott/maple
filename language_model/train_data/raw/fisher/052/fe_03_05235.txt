511.52 512.91 B: yeah 

512.39 517.47 A: hm well that's i mean there's lot of places to find that type of thing it's just a matter of what your

527.19 527.93 A: (( mm )) 

527.88 529.25 B: yeah 

528.94 532.12 A: so hopefully maybe you could help them out in some way 

531.42 539.94 B: i'm thinking that you know because like i said i was homeless for four years and i know what it's like to be outdoors an- and the weather changes and stuff you know 

540.27 550.68 B: rain and trying to find a dry place to sleep how your sleeping bag gets stolen your bag of clothes gets stolen and stuff it's really hard to find places to stash stuff that 

550.78 552.97 B: other homeless people don't look 

551.88 554.49 A: (( hm right )) 

553.36 554.53 B: (( yes )) 

554.82 557.98 A: oh well you should write something about that as well 

555.27 556.21 B: (( you )) 

558.15 562.30 B: know i'm thinking about that where would i send something like that into 

559.62 560.64 A: mhm 

562.78 574.43 A: um i guess it depends what form it takes if it's you know just kind of an essay or if it's a a story i mean i think that there is different places for different forms of whatever kind of writing you would do 

574.18 575.16 B: mhm 

574.46 582.07 A: probably even that that newspaper you were selling would take stories like that so it depends on what 

578.99 585.42 B: yeah yes i i i know they would take that story i know they would yes 

583.75 584.79 A: right
