26.86 34.19 A: (( ah [cough] i wouldn't agree with you because it's like if you're not exercising )) 

34.57 44.10 A: so be it [laughter] but i think ah from the bottom to the top the worst thing is like ah smoking 

43.50 49.93 B: yeah i think i would put that right there with it being a non smoker that's ah it can really ah 

46.27 49.30 A: (( yeah )) 

49.89 51.55 A: (( and )) 

50.17 52.40 B: cut your life span down

105.16 106.76 B: i wouldn't say that that's 

107.19 109.36 B: quite as bad as the other ones 

107.38 108.11 A: (( but )) 

109.78 116.64 A: it's it's again it's the thing is it's like ah every whole issue is moderation right 

116.06 118.41 B: yeah absolutely i would agree with that 

117.21 121.74 A: (( so you can [laughter] if you're not really abusing it ))

188.19 192.86 A: (( think and i think what's the last item on the list what's th- )) 

192.07 197.59 B: let's see they said smoking ah drinking ah caffeine oh drinking lots of caffeine 

194.01 194.85 A: oh 

196.48 203.02 A: drinking again it's the whole thing is like moderation [laughter] yeah 

201.53 204.07 B: yeah yeah i definitely agree with that 

203.53 217.30 A: (( yeah and it's it's again like if you look at the at the french people or the mediterranean type they they drink a lot they drink a lot so i don't see [cough] as long as )) 

217.73 223.91 A: they are not really abusing drinking is not bad and it keeps ah your 

224.00 226.35 A: good cholesterol level 

225.95 229.45 B: yeah yeah red wine can be very helpful for that that's true 

226.42 227.13 A: (( that's )) 

228.14 229.16 A: right 

229.95 239.59 A: right and ah that's that's um that's like yeah that's that something w- w- w- what else can we you suggest too ah 

239.11 240.17 B: um 

240.37 242.08 B: (( let's see um )) 

242.87 244.71 B: i think ah 

246.00 250.51 B: so you're saying you're not a big advocate of ah exercising 

249.56 261.82 A: i'm not saying i'm big advert- ah advocate of exercising but out of one list i think this is not the worst thing [laughter] 

260.87 265.79 B: right right but you'd you'd agree that that's that's pretty important you know for keeping yourself healthy right 

264.75 273.29 A: (( yeah sure that's important of course [laughter] that's that's one of the things that's keep- no i understand that's that's important )) 

271.68 273.22 B: yeah right 

273.66 279.71 A: (( but it's like out of [laughter] the whole list the most harmful to you )) 

278.70 284.06 B: yeah it it's tough to say because i mean you know all those things i guess can have different sort of affects on you 

284.50 286.43 B: on on you body and so forth 

285.81 291.28 A: right but if you're not exercising it's like it's not equal to 

291.47 295.45 A: ah smoking which is basically self destructive right 

294.85 300.46 B: yeah i i would i would agree that's a very bad very bad thing to do i mean it's ah 

300.75 304.87 B: you know it's going to run your body out and you know you see people that ah 

306.11 311.11 B: you know spending so much money on the stuff it's kind of ridiculous really if you think about it 

310.66 317.31 A: i don't know how much or whatever how ridiculous it is it's it's it's the matter of choice 

318.30 321.65 A: if ah because some people can sometimes see that 

321.69 329.85 A: it's so ridiculous to spend on like whatever exercise machine right or on an expensive wine 

330.05 337.83 A: or one of something similar in nature maybe people it it's i think it's a matter of opinion [laughter] 

336.92 339.84 B: well yeah i mean it it's just a matter of ah 

339.96 345.21 B: you know one thing is going to help you out and you know the other thing's going to be a hindrance to you it's 

343.60 351.60 A: yeah but it it's like yeah the smoking is something which you know it it's it's a big expensive habit 

345.32 347.00 B: not really that comparable 

351.66 353.51 B: yes absolutely 

351.99 354.99 A: it's not the most expensive 

354.78 356.67 B: no that that is true 

355.20 357.61 A: [laughter] 

356.88 360.09 B: of course you know on that same token people 

360.24 364.16 B: you know they go out drinking every night they can they can blow a heck of a lot of money 

363.61 365.62 A: yeah much more than that 

365.01 367.23 B: yeah that that's that's true 

366.64 375.57 A: so that's ah yeah it's expensive because ah [laughter] you're not going drinking each day [laughter] my envy 

375.52 382.31 A: or it it's again [laughter] i think the drinking is much more expensive habit than ah smoking 

381.84 383.11 B: yeah that's true 

383.13 392.24 A: yeah but ah [laughter] it's like everything else it's a matter of choice and it it's again drinking i don't know 

392.57 399.24 A: but like for example a couple of years ago i went to physician and the guy told me you know 

399.58 405.41 A: you have to start drinking to boost your good cholesterol at least one drink a a day 

405.87 415.19 A: so i say i said to the guy you know [laughter] i can't stand i can't drink so much he told me [cough] you have to 

415.99 421.33 A: (( or i have to put you on prescription medicine which is much worse )) 

421.07 428.80 B: yeah right yeah yeah well definitely you'd definitely be better to have a glass of red wine with dinner or something absolutely 

426.28 436.33 A: (( right right a a drink [laughter] and again if you ask me if i'm drinking i'm not really )) 

436.32 444.45 A: but [laughter] it feel like you're not drinking you are taking the pills or something like that 

443.75 450.52 B: oh yeah sure plus they can have you know you know a different negative side effect a lot of those new medications 

450.28 451.90 A: yeah yeah 

450.62 453.97 B: you know giving you headaches or or dry mouth or whatever 

453.95 455.01 A: right 

454.38 456.83 B: depending depending on what it is you're taking 

456.95 463.58 A: yeah yeah that's that's fine that's basically yeah and um that's what i 

463.69 466.56 A: (( yeah )) 

465.48 472.41 B: i've never been much of a big fan of the taste of wine myself but ah i mean that that's true you know it can help you out 

469.43 476.32 A: [cough] it's again i look at as do you have choice when you have flu when the doctor prescribes you 

476.19 477.75 B: yeah right right sure 

477.24 488.46 A: so most likely you don't [laughter] and ah l- like for whatever the amount of time's left for us to talk 

479.82 482.75 B: (( yeah )) 

488.70 494.58 A: ah we need to talk probably of something else and ah what about caffeine 

495.28 496.41 B: (( caffeine )) 

495.86 497.35 A: (( yeah )) 

496.53 497.61 B: (( ah )) 

498.96 510.79 B: [cough] i i usually i like to have ah some caffeine like you know fa- fairly early in the morning when i get up and ah you know maybe something ah with lunch you know to kind of help you get ah a little 

504.82 505.73 A: yeah 

510.82 520.11 B: revived you know when you eat your meal and you know you get back to work and i i find that to be kind of helpful ah but you know definitely i try to stay away from that in the evening 

519.97 523.59 A: oh no [laughter] it's again it's the ages 

522.70 525.63 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

523.61 526.85 A: you know a funny thing way way ago [cough] 

526.99 530.83 A: i ask my friend on his way from italy 

530.91 539.99 A: (( to bring me whatever coffee maker the small one which is used in italy or whatever it's here coffee mainly )) 

539.35 541.01 B: the small coffee you said 

540.62 541.39 A: (( huh )) 

541.28 543.17 B: you said the coffee from italy 

543.08 545.96 A: (( ah not the coffee the coffee maker )) 

546.09 547.47 B: oh the maker okay 

547.59 552.00 A: (( and whatever it is in italy mainly they drink espresso )) 

552.17 553.32 B: yeah sure 

553.10 557.90 A: which is ah much stronger that's why [laughter] they drink a spoonful of it 

557.34 559.58 B: yeah lot's lot's of caffeine in that 

558.95 562.90 A: yeah because it it's again it's more concentrated 

563.12 571.68 A: (( and i start doing it and i stopped immediately because it's like ah after getting small cup of it in the morning )) 

571.72 576.01 A: i start feeling like doctor pepper morgan [laughter] 

575.37 581.49 B: yeah right yeah it's that's pretty strong [laughter] like like one of those jolt colas or something 

580.68 586.13 A: right right and ah i feel phew ouch i am over stimulated 

586.16 589.32 A: and i switched to the normal one 

589.38 599.13 A: but it it's again this thing is like [laughter] more mature you are it's like less stimulation you can tolerate 

599.01 599.89 B: (( yeah yeah ))
