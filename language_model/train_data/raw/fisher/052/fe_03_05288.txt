21.89 25.73 B: well i think personally i think that we need to get rid of bush 

25.89 35.28 B: i think he's a very bad president and i think [noise] that when clinton was in office none of these problems were happening and as soon as just like just like before with the other bush same thing happened 

35.46 37.23 B: um 

35.64 38.77 A: what happened we didn't get attacked when the other bush was president 

38.05 39.87 B: no but he went to war 

40.57 42.82 A: well why did why why did we get attacked though 

42.93 44.48 B: why did we get attacked 

43.89 46.53 A: yeah 'cause bush was in 

46.44 50.36 B: no not because bush was in but just because they hated the united states [lipsmack] 

50.13 54.86 A: yeah but they attacked us in uh ninety three too didn't they 

53.81 54.80 B: yeah 

55.18 56.48 B: (( yeah but that was [noise] [noise] )) 

55.59 58.20 A: and they attacked us our embassies in um 

58.52 68.70 A: uh africa and they attacked our ships in during the clinton administration i don't think it has to do with the president that's in charge um and i think we're going a little off topic too 

69.46 70.69 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

72.44 78.49 A: what we what we need to do to prevent further attacks on our count- upon our country that that's the topic 

79.12 82.21 A: um what would what should we be doing 

82.82 86.32 A: you see what we're doing now what would you recommend that we do 

87.97 89.21 B: well i mean 

90.96 93.04 B: [noise] i don't know i really [laughter] 

92.65 101.95 A: you gotta think about it well i mean we've been attacked we were attacked on nine eleven right in our country that was the first time we were attacked in our country 

93.54 94.78 B: yeah 

97.40 98.37 B: mhm 

100.99 103.54 B: (( no no that was that was not the first time [noise] )) 

103.03 107.12 A: well the first time being attacked well are you are you talking about um 

104.89 106.24 B: seriously 

106.73 109.37 B: (( ser- i'm talking about the last what )) 

107.27 108.67 A: uh mcveigh 

108.77 112.02 A: you know are you talking about oklahoma city 

110.45 114.21 B: (( yeah that well that and also the last time the world trade center too )) 

114.11 121.49 A: you're right exactly um so this this group that we're looking to uh defeat in this world 

116.83 119.27 B: [noise] so twice they attacked us 

121.18 122.38 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

121.62 132.29 A: um you know they have a possibility of using biological weapons and they're scared of them using chemical weapons and one day they're scared of using um um nuclear weapons 

131.71 133.13 B: mhm 

133.48 148.18 A: so it seems like since nine eleven we really haven't been attacked so i don't know what well i i have a couple things i know what they've been doing um it seems like they've been safeguarding us i don't think we were attacked because uh bush was in office i think we would have been attacked no matter who was in office 

147.80 154.19 B: [noise] [noise] no but he he's also a good reason uh to he he goes around bullying a lot of different countries and 

151.60 152.16 A: (( [mn] )) 

153.60 157.85 A: but prior to that he wasn't was he what was he doing 

154.85 156.77 B: [noise] no yeah i guess not 

156.99 165.50 B: i guess you're right prior to that he wasn't but ever since like he's just [noise] it seems like he's trying to just trying to take over the world for some reason to me 

165.96 168.35 A: [lipsmack] no i don't i don't i don't look at it that way 

165.97 171.86 B: he just seems like like they ever since they put him in in in to be the president it seems like he's like 

172.26 174.32 B: i don't know he thinks he's like 

173.08 187.92 A: well i don't i don't look at it that way i look at it that we were attacked and we were attacked numerous other times throughout the world over the past decade and i think our intelligence agencies have been telling us that and i think our intelligence agencies 

179.97 180.88 B: mhm 

181.78 183.04 B: (( yeah definitely [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

187.77 189.78 A: need to to be 

189.94 197.15 A: really um bolstered and reorganized and hopefully they're doing that who knows i mean look at the mess they're in now 

193.17 194.07 B: uh-huh 

195.10 195.96 B: yeah 

196.84 197.82 B: (( yeah they )) 

197.10 200.27 A: with the intelligence with iraq and the weapons of mass destruction 

199.77 200.97 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

200.22 214.04 A: i mean i'm i mean it wasn't only our intelligence that said they were over there i mean france germany u._n. they all said they were there but my question is and i'm a bush supporter so i just wanted to let you know but my question is why 

206.28 207.42 B: mhm 

210.95 212.04 B: yeah 

214.46 222.98 A: um i think he's doing a good job with it 'cause we haven't been attacked again and i think we need to confront these terrorists before they you know we can't just we can't 

217.28 218.69 B: (( [noise] oh yeah definitely but )) 

220.57 228.41 B: that's also we haven't been attacked because of also the heightened security we've had i i don't know about where you live but over here 'cause i live like ten minutes from new york 

226.09 227.72 A: yeah 

227.82 229.43 A: (( where oh do ya )) 

228.65 230.74 B: oh yeah i live like right over the bridge

245.71 249.24 A: much closer than jacksonville florida [laughter] [laughter] 

247.05 260.47 B: oh yeah well of course it is but no but i mean like the heightened security like over the bridge and stuff now to get over the bridge it's almost an hour every time you go they got people checking every every truck i mean i think that's i think that's great personally 

253.47 255.18 A: yeah 

257.53 258.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

260.21 270.18 A: yeah i seriously i i i i don't know i don't live up there that would that would be a nuisance to me that seem like it might be going overboard [noise] 

260.81 262.21 B: because [sigh] 

264.55 265.87 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

268.69 274.88 B: [noise] well it it is a nuisance but i mean it all it's also good 'cause they're you know they're they're trying to look out you know they 

274.95 277.85 B: they don't want anything bad to happen again i guess you know 

277.48 278.90 A: okay 

277.91 281.22 B: they got they also got soldiers walking across the bridge 

280.97 282.09 A: yeah 

281.24 283.63 B: on each side two guys on each side [noise] 

282.72 291.07 A: [sigh] well the recent news is they they're talking to that guy that was caught in pakistan uh mohammed the guy that was look in in the tee shirt [laughter] 

288.10 289.10 B: yeah 

289.77 290.94 B: (( yeah yeah yeah [noise] )) 

291.23 301.25 A: um and i was just reading an article about how um they been looking to do uh help with biological and chemical weapons and this and that they're getting some information from him and one of the spots that they were looking to attack was the brooklyn bridge 

300.83 302.16 B: mhm 

301.83 303.45 A: matter of fact they said the uh 

302.67 303.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

303.49 309.81 A: the bridge over in the godzilla movie they wanted to uh get uh materials to tear it down 

305.11 306.72 B: (( [noise] yeah yeah )) 

310.03 310.96 B: uh-huh 

310.64 311.54 A: so 

311.55 312.96 A: um 

313.97 315.77 A: i guess we went a little off topic 

315.46 316.83 B: yeah [laughter] i guess so 

315.86 318.64 A: are people [laughter] but 

316.91 317.85 B: [laughter] 

318.71 319.71 A: (( i don't know )) 

319.72 329.01 A: uh one thing that we i think we need to do is uh kinda rein in our our um intelligence apparatus and get them all in sync 

328.53 329.59 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

329.68 335.96 A: so they communicate with each other better i i still i was i been reading articles where they're still not in sync 

335.98 346.79 A: and uh that was a big problem with the nine eleven and i mean they haven't even invest they still haven't done a thorough investigation with the nine eleven where they're and they're not releasing the reports which which makes me [sigh] 

338.08 339.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

343.03 344.56 B: (( well that's what i [noise] )) 

347.36 349.68 A: you know i don't know what they're hiding but we all 

349.90 351.63 B: they're definitely hiding something 

351.20 353.11 A: [mn] you know what it is 

353.24 355.86 A: i think our government's too big to begin with 

355.13 356.47 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

355.94 358.54 A: [laughter] and um 

359.18 365.58 A: no matter what whether it's education or intelligence or um uh uh um 

366.64 373.02 A: uh government programs it's just too big and bureaucratic and it's not streamlined enough you know what i'm saying 

368.18 368.94 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

372.98 373.93 B: uh 

374.11 375.48 B: kind of i guess [noise] 

375.48 383.79 A: 'cause it gets so big that there's no uh there's no real uh organization to it i mean there is but it's just so massive that it's so hard to get 

383.57 393.61 A: information from one end of it to the other you know what i'm saying it takes time so i think um uh that's something that they need to work on and maybe they have been i don't know 

385.42 388.19 B: yeah i guess i guess yeah i understand what you're saying 

391.71 392.57 B: i also 

393.08 396.29 B: i also think they should tell us a little more than they do tell us 

395.70 397.14 A: like what 

396.43 400.99 B: like i don't know there there's a there's a lot of things that they hide from from the people you know 

400.76 401.38 A: [mn] 

401.05 402.99 B: that i think should be said 

402.57 409.81 A: sure like what i mean they don't well there's a fine line there though because they can't say i mean look at the stuff that's going on in the midwest now with that monkey pox 

409.56 410.45 B: (( uh )) 

410.22 412.16 A: right you know you know what i'm talking about 

411.46 412.22 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

412.40 419.08 A: well i mean who says that's not bioterrorism you know they said they blamed it on some rat that somebody imported in some uh pet store 

418.66 419.73 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

419.25 423.31 A: but i mean all these different diseases that are coming up who says that that's not or sars 

422.83 424.16 B: mhm 

423.67 429.90 A: you know what i'm saying that stuff that was in toronto and uh it's still not really controlled but 

425.98 427.12 B: definitely 

430.17 434.77 A: where how are they going to know when bioterrorism is here you know what i'm saying 

433.92 435.46 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

434.88 439.21 A: because who says that this stuff isn't bioterrorism how do they really track that down 

436.82 437.98 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

439.81 441.50 B: (( i guess you're right )) 

440.88 446.44 A: so it's a it's a tough it's a tough subject they told us to talk about but i think it has to 

446.41 447.41 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

446.93 448.93 A: has to do with um with um 

449.15 450.84 A: uh um 

451.05 452.73 A: the terrorism as a whole
