271.10 273.50 B: [noise] oh really wow wow 

272.34 278.62 A: then a lawyer and now i guess his firm he was kind of an associate he wasn't like really hired a hundred percent but he got fired 

278.78 284.20 A: um [laughter] after they saw what happened so it's kinda it's kinda funny and he had like 

283.20 284.40 B: i can't 

285.06 286.61 A: (( oh no go ahead )) 

286.02 298.55 B: i can't believe he was a jag officer that's unbelievable i can't i just can't believe that and he got drunk on screen and everything that's that's that's that's too much man i can't believe that but that that's a pretty good that's a pretty good idea i mean uh i like that one that's that's pretty good that's 

288.51 289.57 A: yeah 

293.32 294.75 A: [laughter] 

298.47 307.45 B: that's pretty good but i totally believe those women would totally compete for that million dollars i mean do what it takes you know what i mean to win that money so that'd be kinda interesting you know 

304.20 305.31 A: oh yeah 

305.98 306.76 A: yeah 

307.69 317.83 A: you know it's funny with these reality things it used to be like five years ago it was all the um you know all the talk with the talk shows and now it's uh and now the big craze is these you know 

307.75 308.70 B: but uh 

317.44 318.49 B: yeah 

317.82 323.93 A: survivor and and you know survivor was kinda like the first one but then every- you know everyone had a spin off and it doesn't feel like survivor 

320.45 321.68 B: yeah 

322.59 325.53 B: celebrity survivor yeah 

324.21 333.20 A: celebrity yeah that's the one [laughter] and then you have kind of like um the real world is kind of like a form of uh reality the real 

326.55 328.09 B: (( that was just too much )) 

330.53 338.55 B: right yeah the real world i think it was it has been around for a while because i remember i was watching it when i was uh in high school and uh yeah that's 

336.84 339.43 A: yeah it's it's been around for a while you're right 

338.60 349.71 B: that's like one of the first i guess reality shows and uh yeah that'd probably be it that's that's the earliest one that i can remember where they have like with the cameras everywhere and that's when they had that i mean i just 

347.62 348.47 A: yeah 

348.58 349.60 A: (( i think that was )) 

349.71 363.40 B: yeah now it's just i think they're really gonna cross the line with like ethics and what's ethical or not ethical or not like the the one that we were talking about earlier or last i don't think that's ethical man you know uh tricking people like that the the one where they're they're competing for a million dollars the women 

358.81 359.86 A: which one 

363.32 365.54 A: (( oh yeah yeah i i know what you mean yeah )) 

364.04 373.54 B: yeah that's that's i mean i mean that that i don't know you know i'm sure that they have tons of lawyers and they're making 'em sign all types of agreements they can't sue this or that you know 

373.51 379.92 B: but you know the guy he's going into it and he thinks that you know he's looking for like you know may- maybe he's looking for some type of you know 

373.65 374.76 A: no you're right 

380.50 386.86 B: genuine love or commitment and you know and he's gonna find out that they're really just competing for the money so 

385.96 392.82 A: well i wonder what kind of jobs do people have that allow them to like take off work for like what three or three weeks or five weeks or something you know 

392.13 393.43 B: (( yeah )) 

393.04 406.66 A: and they can just like you know take like a little you know extended vacation time and then i don't know it just seems kinda weird that you know i guess they uh i guess they're there for the money they get to go for and the the first guy to kinda be deceitful was that joe millionaire guy i mean he had to lie for 

406.64 409.28 A: you know be a millionaire so i guess it's the acting thing 

407.86 419.29 B: that's true too that's that's true too that's true that's true too i thought that one was a pretty good id- idea joe millionaire when that came out i mean this guy really was just like a construction worker or whatever just like a a regular guy 

419.33 431.16 B: and uh man i'm sure that these women were just like totally disappointed and then some of 'em i was watching some talk show and they swore they thought oh no this guy totally has a million dollars you know there's no way that he doesn't just by the way that he talks 

430.98 434.40 B: this and that you know and that's just that's just unreal 

436.48 440.87 A: and then that well then that girl that didn't get chosen she was like i knew he wasn't a millionaire [laughter] 

439.69 442.79 B: oh she said that she said that [laughter] 

440.95 451.03 A: yeah that that that sarah girl the one that like uh was like had had posed for like playboy or whatever after like uh she was like yeah i knew he wasn't a millionaire and i'm like yeah whatever 

443.73 445.23 B: (( oh )) 

447.18 448.77 B: oh okay okay 

450.84 453.21 B: yeah i'm sure you did [laughter] 

452.30 459.96 A: and it was it was funny because like if you notice like in joe millionaire the women the women weren't as attractive as they had like been on the bachelor or other shows 

455.41 456.26 B: yeah 

459.07 460.79 B: right right 

459.97 467.75 A: they weren't like they weren't like super hot and so i was i don't know why if they were if they were you know because he wasn't as good looking i don't know did you notice that or not really 

467.22 470.81 B: no i really didn't notice that i really didn't notice that because i didn't follow it that closely 

470.65 483.60 B: but uh maybe they just sought some hungry like money hungry women that's what i'm thinking you know just to just to make some drama into it but you know it may not have been in looks maybe i was thinking something along the lines of that but um [noise] 

474.74 476.35 A: [laughter] 

476.59 477.74 A: oh you're right 

482.39 484.08 A: (( no you're absolutely right so ))
