1.00 2.22 A: hello 

1.96 4.27 B: hi i'm luanne 

4.51 6.06 A: hi i'm dave 

5.91 8.49 B: hi dave [laughter] where are you calling from 

8.45 11.22 A: uh i'm in the atlanta area how about you 

11.02 12.65 B: i live in marietta 

12.82 14.22 A: uh i'm sorry 

13.93 15.50 B: i live in marietta [mn] 

15.28 19.33 A: oh okay well actually i i've just come from marietta [laughter] 

19.62 23.27 B: yeah well we're supposed to talk about movies [noise] 

21.80 25.29 A: yeah i think so uh it's like a pretty easy topic 

25.31 27.67 B: i think so um 

26.63 27.55 A: yeah 

27.95 31.53 B: i guess the question was what was the last movie that you saw 

32.11 38.62 A: yeah that's uh that's that's a tough call for me the the last movie i saw in a theater 

38.69 43.58 A: uh i think was uh last year when star wars opened up 

42.82 45.14 B: uh see i see movies 

45.24 49.78 B: at least i have two kids so i see movies twice a month i would say 

50.01 51.04 A: wow 

50.18 56.17 B: um yeah my fourteen year old is begging me to go see matrix reloaded right now but he's only fourteen 

56.24 68.54 A: right right i uh i actually would [noise] love to see the matrix and uh [noise] love to see the new x. men movie but haven't really had the time to to get into a theater [noise] to do it 

68.76 69.56 A: um 

69.04 72.90 B: yeah well then you don't have a fourteen year old boy [laughter] 

71.57 73.26 A: right right exactly 

73.46 76.04 B: right i just saw x. men last x. men 

76.32 78.26 B: two last week 

77.86 78.74 A: yeah 

78.78 81.29 B: with my fourteen year old [noise] 

80.61 86.73 A: yeah what uh what about what about rentals do you do a lot of movie rentals and that sort of 

85.71 88.30 B: i do a lot of movie rentals 

87.58 89.72 A: (( stuff yeah )) 

88.70 101.38 B: i do because i have kids like we just took a trip to florida so we instead of even renting we purchased a whole bunch of movies and a portable d._v._d. player to take to florida 

91.34 92.15 A: (( right x._n. )) 

101.26 103.48 A: right right 

102.46 108.96 B: so it yeah i have a daughter so she wanted like legally blonde and you know that kind of stuff [noise] 

107.13 108.03 A: right 

108.70 110.14 A: mhm 

109.64 111.61 B: yeah so [noise] [mn] 

111.09 117.53 A: yeah that's uh th- those portable d._v._d. things are are very cool i uh 

116.76 117.33 B: (( mm )) 

117.63 123.74 A: i don't own one myself but i i i am pretty sure that the next vehicle i buy is gonna have one in it 

124.10 131.23 B: [noise] [sigh] well you know we just bought a new car i just bought a mountaineer and we looked at purchasing a d._v._d. player in it 

127.67 128.46 A: (( right mhm )) 

131.29 135.00 B: and we thought it was better a better value 

135.18 138.28 B: to purchase a portable d._v._d. player 

138.27 140.25 A: right right and that 

139.24 147.33 B: because when we sell the car or when my son drives or you know whatever we could just take the d._v._d. player with us wherever we go [noise] 

147.10 161.65 A: yeah that that that makes a lot of sense usually i uh um rather than than getting into the theaters obviously i don't do that a lot i i on occasion do rentals maybe one or two a month and and then i have a laptop and i i load movies onto that frequently but 

161.99 171.85 A: um un- unfortunately still not uh still not quite [noise] quite uh up to the current [noise] with [noise] with a lot of the movies [laughter] [noise] 

171.27 177.37 B: yeah well i was a communicat- video communications major and i did video stuff 

177.16 178.12 A: oh yeah 

177.39 187.01 B: so i i used to always see movies like star wars [laughter] a- and then when my kids were little you stop seeing them un- unless it's about them 

181.27 182.08 A: right 

187.27 188.12 A: right 

187.58 196.84 B: and so i now last year i joined a book club which is very cool because one month we do a movie and one month we do a book 

196.57 206.76 A: oh that's that's actually a cool idea i've uh i have a a very young son uh he is he's just about twelve weeks old now 

206.94 207.80 A: (( and oh )) 

206.99 209.15 B: oh congratulations [sigh] 

208.85 216.00 A: thanks i i imagine that the next several years worth of movies i'm gonna see are gonna be very kid oriented movies 

216.43 221.54 A: the the idea of doing a book club like that is is is a really good idea 

216.64 218.51 B: they are 

221.35 227.69 B: [noise] [mn] well we were all kind of mums with kids i have an eleven and a fourteen year old who were 

226.51 227.83 A: right 

227.70 235.62 B: you know just kind of like in between and we had all stopped reading we had all stopped doing anything for ourselves that's all we do is take care of our kids 

235.00 236.67 A: (( [noise] right )) 

236.09 250.51 B: so eight of us got together and we [noise] thought we did not have time to really read at all and we never saw movies any more so we do one every month and it really is [noise] it's very difficult to get there um 

243.76 244.61 A: right 

249.91 251.02 A: right 

250.78 253.73 B: [noise] but it's the best of both worlds really [noise] 

253.14 256.29 A: right well that that makes a lot of sense in fact my uh 

256.36 270.12 A: my wife has been talking about starting some sort of movie club with with friends of uh of ours uh and and she's also very into the whole book club idea so that kind of combination thing sounds like a good idea 

256.37 257.20 B: [noise] 

264.48 265.12 B: [noise] 

269.55 273.67 B: [noise] well it really took a long time to pull it together it took us 

272.80 273.53 A: right 

273.80 286.04 B: you know really it took us a year of talking about it before anybody did anything about it [noise] and then one day we just said you know what we just the third thursday of the month you're coming that's it 

279.35 280.17 A: right 

285.70 287.02 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

286.98 293.44 B: and so we also take turns picking movies which is good because i see stuff 

293.54 296.31 B: that i would never have picked in a million years 

296.05 297.40 A: oh yeah 

296.87 300.96 B: [noise] yeah and movies like i really wanted to go see adaptation um 

300.17 300.97 A: yeah 

301.10 309.26 B: and so i picked mine was last month so i picked that because i never would've seen it because my husband and i are too busy with our kids taking them to x. men 

309.03 311.60 A: right [laughter] right and 

309.71 310.70 B: [laughter] 

310.91 313.46 B: or doing social stuff right 

313.39 316.91 A: right and that that that just seems like a great idea i 

316.97 323.94 A: uh i kind of have a broadcast [noise] background and uh and was very very heavy into movies uh 

323.82 333.52 A: was involved with [noise] the atlanta film and video festival for a long time [noise] and and i haven't done anything even remotely like that in the past year year and a half or so 

333.68 338.80 A: and uh it seems seems like putting something like that together is a good idea because 

333.85 334.87 B: right 

338.88 344.86 A: there are a lot of movies that i might not otherwise get to see and and certainly a lot that i would like to see that are 

344.89 349.47 A: you know i i look up and now they're they're out on d._v._d. and stuff like that so [laughter] 

349.35 354.87 B: yeah and it's nice having the kids the age they are because we can actually rent a lot 

354.53 355.42 A: yeah 

354.72 364.41 B: um that are p._g. thirteen even though my daughter's eleven it you find it different with the second we let her watch a lot more than my son at eleven ever did 

358.06 358.86 A: right 

364.13 365.47 A: right 

364.97 368.56 B: and we see a lot of 'cause a lot of 'em are p._g. thirteen 

368.64 369.76 A: right yeah 

368.64 374.59 B: and so we will sit and turn that into like family night and go rent a movie that way 

374.57 383.38 A: yeah they that's yeah that's true that's uh it it it's kind of interesting that this this particular topic comes up on this project today 

383.51 384.78 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

383.84 391.33 A: just because i i work for a college in marietta and uh i was out there today today was our student movie day 

391.40 395.93 A: and uh the students were watching spiderman which i i still had not seen 

392.35 393.04 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

395.99 397.41 A: and 

397.16 399.80 B: yeah we own that one [laughter] 

398.93 410.19 A: right right i actually i went out and bought the d._v._d. because i figured i would i would uh wanna wanna watch it eventually and and uh i was sitting there a- as we were sh- as we were screening the movie 

408.53 409.64 B: [noise] 

410.36 416.25 A: just kinda thinking you know it's it's interesting here i am showing this to my students and i i haven't you then 

416.40 427.75 A: and uh so so doing things like that and and having the the sorts of student activities in the family nights too is i- is uh kind of where i see all of movies now [laughter] 

420.64 421.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

427.21 430.90 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah well is it raining on you 'cause it just started pouring here 

430.93 433.50 A: uh no actually i 

433.62 437.31 A: i uh kind of drove through a monsoon on the way out to marietta today but 

437.56 441.18 A: nothing uh nothing serious i'm i'm in alpharetta now so [laughter] 

440.83 446.18 B: [noise] yeah well my son is canoeing south of georgia and he did not want to go 

446.11 458.18 B: because the matrix was coming out [laughter] and he was begging me to take him and i'm still not going to until i see it because he's seen the edited version of the matrix on t._v. 

453.62 454.91 A: right right 

457.97 459.24 A: right 

458.74 464.98 B: but to see the real thing on a big screen i think he could have nightmares for a really long time 

464.81 471.29 A: yeah that's that's entirely possible [laughter] yeah it's it's it's kind of a very uh 

466.44 467.94 B: [noise] 

471.41 472.70 B: [noise] 

471.56 478.39 A: e- even though it's keanu reeves and it's a it's a lot of action and all that there are a lot of very heavy topics involved there mhm 

477.60 488.99 B: [noise] yeah well you know i love my d. my little portable d._v._d. player because what i've been doing i work part time and i'll but i work out of the house so what i'll do is i walk around with the d._v._d. player 

488.94 503.34 B: and i rented the regular matrix so i could just watch it to see whether he could watch it so i can just stop it and start it and and so and i find with the portable d._v._d. i have um been renting a few more movies 

489.02 489.85 A: uh-huh 

494.60 495.52 A: right 

503.12 504.06 A: yeah 

503.36 513.22 B: because i can just like take it with me or i drive car pool 'cause my son goes to saint francis and i'll let like them watch it on the way home or something like that so 

506.81 507.92 A: (( right mhm )) 

513.60 514.83 A: yeah what 

513.67 515.42 B: yeah so it's been interesting 

515.32 518.37 A: yeah that's that's actually a really good idea i 

518.59 520.18 A: (( i i am kind of )) 

519.44 520.04 B: (( [noise] )) 

520.39 526.70 A: very into technology and as as much as i am i'm it's a little surprising to me [noise] that i don't have one of those yet 

526.95 527.90 A: um 

527.22 541.35 B: yeah well we pur- we just purchased a regular d._v._d. slash v._c._r. i own a mac and a p._c. and yet i find myself using this portable d._v._d. player [laughter] except when we watch it as a family 

534.24 535.32 A: right 

541.19 542.71 A: right right 

542.91 550.17 A: well that yeah that's that's very interesting as i said i had a lot of stuff on my on my laptop at one point i was travelling a great deal 

544.87 546.46 B: [noise] 

547.73 551.07 B: [noise] [noise] 

550.29 559.10 A: and almost every movie i saw for you know a good year was either on an aeroplane or something i had loaded onto my laptop um 

551.87 553.87 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

559.53 565.43 A: but uh i i like the idea of the portable d._v._d. players just i- if for no other reason than [noise] you 

565.53 570.29 A: you certainly do have more freedom to kind of kind of go where you need to go and get that done 

569.87 579.45 B: [noise] yeah and see my kids had been my son in particular until we password protected him he was downloading a lot of movies from kazaa a lot of stuff 

575.85 576.70 A: right 

578.42 580.44 A: yeah right 

579.73 583.10 B: and yeah i really found that to be troublesome 

583.12 584.87 B: [laughter] 

583.41 592.71 A: yeah well in yeah in addition to not having any any real direct control over the subject matter you uh you also have all kinds of 

592.80 595.91 A: uh of copyright laws and and that sort of thing do you know 

596.19 596.78 B: (( [sigh] )) 

596.22 598.90 A: it uh it definitely can be a problem i 

598.95 599.89 B: right well even
