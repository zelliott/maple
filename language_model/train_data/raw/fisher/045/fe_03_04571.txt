73.22 83.48 A: well some of my friends and of course i'm older too but some of my friends that went to see it enjoyed the music [sigh] but they thought it lacked a storyline

119.52 133.53 A: it is funny and um i felt like a needed a good laugh [laughter] so i did but i don't care about renting movies and for one thing it gets kinda stressful to me to have to get 'em back in a certain time 

123.37 125.00 B: [laughter] yeah yeah 

133.94 140.75 B: yeah and then you know sometimes my v._c._r. would break would [laughter] break down and the tape would get stuck in there [laughter] yeah it's 

141.18 148.11 A: right and i and i think that it lacks a lot don't you not having the big screen 

148.52 152.35 B: yeah yeah the i the the movie experience is really better 

152.36 156.61 B: the uh the theater experience yeah but i prefer the big screen and so on 

155.75 158.48 A: right the sound effects and 

157.81 159.58 B: yeah 

159.07 162.20 A: and sometimes the social part of it 

162.74 169.55 A: although in louisville [laughter] if you go to the movie in the matinee there's practically nobody there 

169.50 183.97 B: yeah well sometimes i'll go to a matinee and and and there'll be a lot of people there you know actually whenever i i go to the movies whenever i go by myself if i don't with with uh someone else i always prefer to go to the matinee because 

181.37 182.42 A: mhm 

184.29 190.22 B: like uh like i could pay ten dollars like nine or [laughter] ten dollars to go see a movie you know 

190.30 193.79 B: and pay like like half price to go to a matinee you know 

193.50 199.19 A: right it really is ridiculous i mean here it's five dollars for a matinee 

195.78 196.62 B: yeah 

199.12 201.28 B: yeah yeah it's same here same here 

201.14 202.60 A: oh well then it's 

201.72 207.19 B: is it there are people paying eight nine dollars for a regular movie in like in kentucky 

206.16 208.00 A: oh [sigh]

212.04 214.26 B: (( oh yeah )) 

213.43 216.77 A: and i though louisville was cheaper than 

217.22 218.92 A: like where you live 

218.99 224.52 B: yeah you know i hear a lot of stories about that like that this is the most expensive p- place in the country to live 

224.27 225.36 A: right 

224.92 228.40 B: i don't i don't know i always wonder about the detail how much it is 

227.59 232.18 A: but you make a lot more money [laughter] that's what i hear 

229.96 231.66 B: yeah yeah 

231.81 235.94 B: yeah that's true that's true you have to 

235.36 239.19 A: so how often do you go to a movie 

239.25 241.64 B: like [laughter] two or three times a year 

242.09 244.50 B: sometimes yeah 

242.13 243.26 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

244.74 253.96 B: sometimes i might go like every month it you know different years it depends on if there's anything good playing sometimes it seems like there's only bad movies out 

244.79 245.69 A: (( and d- )) 

253.43 259.77 A: now i have to agree with that [laughter] [sigh] course we probably don't like the same kind of movies but um 

260.09 263.36 A: [lipsmack] i just think there are a lot of bad ones out 

263.67 265.18 B: yeah 

264.59 267.76 A: and i don't like three hour ones either [sigh] 

268.18 269.33 B: yeah 

268.74 270.63 A: how do you feel about that 

271.40 274.75 B: no i i can't sit still for a three hour movie either 

275.02 276.28 A: yeah 

276.14 279.74 B: and usually those those three hour movies they're 

280.37 283.05 B: they're they're boring they're like um 

284.48 297.77 B: they're like like like english movies like they're they're like to me it would seem like that they're a lot of boring stuff that you'd see like on channel thirteen like dances with wolves with kevin costner i didn't like that or [sigh] titanic you know 

297.80 304.73 B: like those historical movies i don't know i i guess i could maybe sit better through a three hour comedy [laughter] 

299.62 300.72 A: right 

305.48 309.35 A: so what kind of movies you say you like sci fi 

308.94 315.71 B: yeah like i [mn] i i saw star wars when i was like three or four years old when that first came out and i've loved it ever since 

315.41 319.26 A: [laughter] that's my son in law's that way too 

319.01 320.33 B: yeah 

319.98 326.32 A: and what is that other one that he likes so well they're they're about to make the third one 

328.16 329.45 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] i don't know

344.86 346.00 A: mhm 

346.31 353.77 A: my son in law really liked it he had he had read the book and [sigh] but it didn't look like anything i would like

354.14 358.38 B: yeah yeah i my dad likes that stuff it's 

359.07 363.97 B: it's like that's like an from an english novel from a few decades ago like 

363.99 369.46 B: like people who are are interest in i think like european writing are more interested in that kind of thing 

368.91 369.93 A: (( oh )) 

370.04 374.78 A: huh well course my son in law's older than you but he's uh

376.97 377.90 A: but 

378.02 381.83 A: i mean that's kinda young to like that kind of stuff isn't it 

382.15 384.31 A: or forty three seem old to you 

383.94 384.89 B: well 

385.33 389.85 B: actually actually [mn] yeah well it's older than me a lot older than me 

389.68 390.83 A: right

397.93 399.49 B: yeah 

399.24 400.20 A: [laughter] 

399.68 404.52 B: yeah my my dad rented uh a lord of the rings video tape 

404.82 409.92 B: a few years ago and i i it was like three hours long i thought it was boring you know 

409.71 410.93 A: right 

410.26 422.19 B: actually actually i think i saw it when i was like a child like maybe ten years old i would i would have though that was interesting i a lot of the things yeah like a lot of the things i liked years ago i don't like any more 

417.58 418.79 A: oh really 

422.96 435.20 B: like just movies in general i really don't i don't like very much you know like [lipsmack] i i think i've just got gotten narrow interests narrower interests in movies now like like 

423.12 423.72 A: (( w- )) 

434.58 435.51 A: yeah 

435.51 439.73 B: like if it's a famous actor that i like i'll i'll watch it like 

440.28 443.28 B: i really like the uh austin powers 

443.49 444.99 B: series you know i i'll 

444.19 446.20 A: (( oh do you [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

445.01 445.97 B: yeah 

446.43 448.60 A: you get a lot of laughs out of that 

448.22 449.11 B: (( you )) 

449.41 453.14 B: know my chaste- change tastes change a lot from year to year 

453.13 464.23 A: well not only that it's so expensive to go to them to the movie if you're dating or something and [sigh] of course i know dating's different now than it was in my day but 

464.13 470.34 A: you know if you're paying for your girlfriend and so forth that's a big expense 

469.91 478.13 B: yeah yeah and uh yeah but it you do get a lot more for it if you go out and see it in the theater i guess you get what you pay for 

478.82 486.66 A: yeah of course when i was growing up i mean the movies were so cheap and that's what we did for entertainment 'cause there wasn't any t._v. 

486.69 488.40 B: yeah 

487.77 492.44 A: so uh it was a lot different then that's the way we dated 

493.05 493.84 B: yeah 

493.10 493.98 A: so 

494.35 498.03 A: so life has just moved along a lot differently 

497.76 502.69 B: yeah sometimes though i i i will watch movies like from when my father was 

503.03 512.03 B: a child like from the forties and fifties and they're interesting you know they have to grow on you though [laughter] you have to you know sit down and really watch it to start to like it 

512.00 521.19 A: [laughter] oh i think the really good movies were made back in those days the gone with the winds and um 

521.14 528.84 A: [lipsmack] just a lot o- but of course you know like you grew up with star wars that we kinda grew up with the other movies 

528.86 530.09 B: (( but yeah )) 

529.52 532.68 A: so maybe that's where the line is 

532.97 536.53 B: yeah yeah i think i probably would like a lot of the 

536.65 544.55 B: the older movies from the forties and fifties if i just sat down and watched them like um like once i saw mr smith goes to washington 

540.32 541.31 A: right 

544.31 547.08 A: yeah that's a great movie [laughter] 

546.39 549.95 B: yeah [laughter] i i i liked it i liked it 

549.00 552.15 A: and out of africa have you ever seen that 

552.06 554.06 B: no i've heard of it 

553.49 555.39 A: i think you would like that 

555.31 557.02 B: yeah 

556.76 557.97 A: but uh 

558.50 562.83 A: [lipsmack] i mean there are just uh the acting seems so much better [laughter] 

563.24 565.87 B: yeah yeah 

564.15 569.18 A: and but i guess we're we're into the generation gap 

569.67 570.56 B: yeah 

569.82 573.02 A: so does you dad live up there with you 

572.79 577.20 B: well he lives in eddiston he that's about like uh forty minutes away
