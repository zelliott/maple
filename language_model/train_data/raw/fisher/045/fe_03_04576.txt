123.03 133.05 A: [mn] who else does it have in it i don't i don't remember the other guys' names but it's basically a group of guys and one of 'em finds out that his his wife is 

132.98 138.84 A: uh cheating on him and so he has to move out and he gets this apartment but it's basically like a 

138.95 152.33 A: um a frat house that he buys on campus [laughter] and so the rest of the movie they're throwing parties and he becomes the the godfather of the [laughter] frat house on campus it's very it's very funny so

158.85 160.14 A: yeah 

159.62 161.75 B: it was um 

163.23 164.97 B: [sigh] took place i think in the 

166.35 167.48 B: fifties 

167.29 168.32 A: mhm 

167.84 177.56 B: or whatever but it was it was just like an excellent movie like such a departure for tom hanks f- from some of the other movies he's played in like you don't re- really expect him to be like a a hit man 

174.48 176.05 A: yeah it looked pretty good 

177.83 184.66 B: and y- it just you know you're astounded wow he's played such an evil nasty role over here what a [noise] oops 

183.17 185.67 A: [laughter] i wanna check that out 

184.94 191.25 B: but it was an excellent movie it holds your interest from beginning to end it really holds your interest 'cause it spans 

187.80 188.62 A: yeah 

191.40 194.61 B: like a trying to think what it spans a short period of time 

194.46 195.39 A: uh-huh 

194.85 195.71 B: i forgot h- 

196.97 199.15 B: trying to think no i think it only spans like a 

199.75 208.54 B: i'm not sure if it spans like a year of the guy's life or what maybe even a shorter period of time but paul newman is the boss like the head of you know the head of the gang whatever else 

205.91 206.79 A: uh-huh 

208.38 209.27 A: uh-huh 

208.59 217.61 B: and he does a a terrific job but the movie is excellent and the cinematography in it is excellent you know how like the godfather just like the way they set up the scenes and whatever else 

217.33 219.01 A: yeah i liked the godfather 

217.37 224.70 B: it kinda reminded you of that i'm not really into that part of it too much i just enjoy the storyline more but this time as you're watching the movie you think 

224.80 229.43 B: boy this is really well directed and you know shot and everything [laughter] else 

229.25 230.18 A: yeah 

229.60 232.27 B: that was very good have you seen chicago 

230.85 231.75 A: yeah 

232.31 235.16 A: uh no i haven't 

234.65 238.02 B: yeah i wanted to see it but i guess i keep kept missing it 

238.13 239.73 A: (( yeah i heard it was good )) 

239.16 241.72 B: (( yeah i know got a lot of awards )) 

241.20 244.17 A: there's yeah there's quite a few movies i guess i haven't seen 

244.78 245.54 A: (( that i )) 

245.63 246.38 B: (( do you )) 

245.66 247.07 A: wanna go see 

246.78 248.10 B: what you wanna go see 

248.17 253.05 A: um [mn] what was the one that the gangs of new york 

253.35 257.49 B: i people at work some of the girls at work have seen that and some said it was 

257.62 259.34 B: violent but excellent 

259.09 259.94 A: uh-huh 

259.37 261.56 B: and others said it was a little bit too long 

261.76 262.69 A: yeah 

262.09 266.47 B: i think i would like to see it 'cause i think it was probably very interesting 

263.92 264.74 A: yeah 

266.50 269.55 A: yeah you never never know what you're missing until you go see 

269.32 270.27 B: right 

270.58 273.71 A: it and the new matrix movie's coming out 

273.59 276.02 B: i've never i've never really seen the other one 

275.76 279.88 A: oh you never saw the first one it's it's interesting it's definitely different 

276.55 277.75 B: no no 

278.44 280.67 B: (( what is it basically about )) 

280.53 281.37 A: (( huh )) 

280.88 282.69 B: what is it about 

282.51 285.75 A: well the the first one is uh [mn] 

286.21 291.66 A: i i saw it quite a while back and i'll try to remember what the kind of the main point was that 

290.89 291.68 B: mhm 

291.64 303.08 A: the world they were living in wasn't really a real world even though they thought it was most of it was either computer generated people or uh 

301.85 306.18 B: does it take place in present time or is this supposed to be like something like way out in the future 

304.98 309.04 A: yeah yeah no it it takes i i believe it's the present time it takes place in 

307.80 308.49 B: oh 

309.13 319.27 A: and i the gist of it is that uh i i can't remember what the the big thing is but it's it's kind of a cross between computer generated images 

318.75 319.67 B: mhm 

319.05 325.43 A: and these people who are born who have their brains kind of linked up to the to this 

323.38 324.11 B: oh 

325.99 329.20 A: kind of hardware that runs this whole thing 

329.51 333.87 A: and so i mean it's it's different so it's interesting though 

334.20 337.72 B: 'cause watching on the news at the the move- uh last night 

337.65 351.46 B: it's already made around forty two forty three million dollars and it has been released worldwide and i was laughing at one point 'cause they were saying that some principal in some school i forgot where he was he noticed that a lot of his students were missing 

340.63 341.91 A: yeah 

351.05 352.65 A: [laughter] 

351.48 366.16 B: that day so he says they must be at the theater so sure enough he plants himself outside the theater and these kids start walking out of the thea- he busts 'em all and suspends 'em [laughter] i says those kids were dumb they should've waited until after school and gone to it 

354.46 355.44 A: yeah 

355.63 357.03 A: yeah probably 

360.85 362.51 A: that's funny 

366.00 369.20 B: like the you know the showing at night or something [laughter] 

367.89 371.42 A: yeah r- well i guess they didn't 'cause they figured it'd be sold out huh 

370.72 376.39 B: yeah i've never lined only remem- movie i ever remember lining up for and waiting in line for was the exorcist 

376.26 377.71 A: [laughter] 

376.38 382.54 B: a- remember that one years ago i remember my girlfriend's brother he her him and his date had gone to like the 

378.05 379.04 A: yeah 

382.46 389.00 B: afternoon show i think they had so many shows of it going on because it was like crowds all over the place so we just you know 

385.22 386.18 A: uh-huh 

388.89 398.12 B: g- he he came back with the tickets and we you know we went to the evening show it was just like a mass of people you couldn't even walk in it was just like you just got pushed in [laughter] you just got 

396.65 401.35 A: yeah every every once in a while they come out with one that was hugely hyped movies 

398.92 403.59 B: you you just got pushed down the isle whether you wanted to go or not [laughter] 

402.40 404.19 A: yeah 

404.20 410.98 A: yeah like when star wars released the second edition and all that just [mn] it's ei- 

406.83 408.60 B: i've never seen that either 

409.44 413.51 B: i don't know why it's like i don't know why i just don't think i could get into those movies 

413.13 418.65 A: i saw it and i i didn't think it was really that great but i guess it's such a following that you know 

417.31 418.30 B: mhm 

419.25 422.05 A: that just everyone wants to go see what it's about 

419.32 420.46 B: like i look at some 

421.46 436.03 B: yeah my aunt's in her sixties and she saw them i says how in the world did you ever wanna watch that and she said well a couple of years ago she was her next door neighbors have three you know small children she says and that she was babysitting 'em and the kids wanted to watch that movie and she says you know what she says the movie turned out to be good 

435.75 436.48 A: yeah 

436.54 444.67 B: i says what and she says yeah and i've seen all of 'em as time went along as i babysat the kids oh let's watch watch the next [laughter] segment of the movie 

444.67 450.07 A: yeah s- some movies that just kind of generate a following where you have to go see what the next thing is 

450.56 452.93 B: i enjoy movies i find 'em very relaxing 

452.76 454.53 A: yeah definitely 

454.22 462.53 B: only time i don't find 'em relaxing is when there's a bunch of like you know thirteen or fourteen year old kids just y- jib jabbering all over the place or you know having food fights with one another 

461.98 463.64 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

462.63 464.23 B: but for most parts they 

464.28 465.93 B: they're pretty well behaved 

464.48 470.24 A: oh now they're starting to show like commercials and st- in at the instead of the preview 

469.72 470.75 B: mhm 

470.28 472.38 A: you noticed that 

471.96 473.72 B: last time around 

474.16 476.83 B: it was commercials it was for pepsi 

476.57 477.65 A: yeah 

477.10 479.97 B: and i forgot whatever else and the f- 

479.03 484.02 A: well the one we went to last night had a a visa card commercial [laughter] 

483.93 487.96 B: yeah b- and and then the previews that they show were off a movie that you say 

488.14 496.52 B: i don't even wanna go see these movies [laughter] [mn] i'd rather see the commercials but i noticed like like you said in like the past year there's been a big change 

489.83 490.89 A: yeah 

496.60 511.38 B: whereas like up until maybe what a year ago even maybe eight nine months ago all you got were previews and this time around it was the commercials and the one for like pepsi and as you're watching it you're really thinking is this a movie 'cause it started with some 

501.85 503.32 A: right right 

511.36 517.03 B: kid like you know like a in a car like in a dessert or something and you're saying to myself okay 

514.90 515.84 A: uh-huh 

516.99 529.76 B: what's going on over and everyone in the theater's doing the same thing what movie is this i don't recognize this movie star [laughter] and then all of a sudden you the pepsi logo comes on and the rest of the commercial goes on like oh even in the movies now you get stuck with a commercial 

521.88 523.07 A: [laughter] 

527.23 528.11 A: yeah 

529.08 531.18 A: yeah get stuck with the commercials 

530.33 532.05 B: yeah and can't get away from 'em 

532.11 537.48 A: oh well [laughter] i'd i'd still rather go to the theater than than rent a movie 

532.79 534.53 B: [laughter] 

537.75 542.59 B: i like to rent movies too but like i said sometimes i have a tendency to walk out of room and think oh yeah 

542.78 553.84 B: [laughter] and not put it on pause and go back where where if you're in a theater it's like totally rel- relaxes you you're out of your house you're not near anything that you have to do and like you says there's no phone ringing no one can interrupt you 

553.98 557.00 B: and so you just sit there and watch the movie i enj- i enjoy it 

556.66 560.65 A: yeah a- and i get the surround sound and the huge screen and 

560.05 561.02 B: yeah 

560.75 561.95 A: all that 

561.34 565.82 B: but the surround sound can sometimes make you deaf [laughter] what depends what they're playing 

563.80 566.22 A: yeah it's it's a little too loud 

566.38 574.35 A: although it although it keeps you from being distracted by anyone else who might be talking in the theater [laughter] so loud you can't hear 'em 

571.56 573.14 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

573.88 577.49 B: yeah by the time you walk out you're stone deaf anyway so it won't make any difference 

577.13 578.11 A: yeah 

577.75 579.62 B: what's your all time favorite movie 

579.55 580.89 A: um 

581.09 582.38 A: gosh 

583.80 586.53 A: uh i don't do you have one let me think on that 

586.00 587.15 B: okay well 

587.24 588.85 B: i like pretty woman 

588.58 589.47 A: uh-huh 

589.58 592.42 B: and but i think my all time favorite 

592.52 594.09 B: would have to be the godfather 

593.94 594.85 A: uh-huh 

594.21 596.24 B: the first uh godfather one 

596.97 599.89 A: you know what movie i really like and i don't even know if this came out
