13.77 14.62 B: yes 

14.87 19.17 A: all right oh well i think that answer gets a big old resounding yes 

20.19 22.95 B: oh what say it again i'm sorry 

22.32 27.58 A: ah do you feel that there's something seriously wrong with the schools in the u._s. right now 

28.22 33.23 B: well the only topic i'm talking about the school system 

33.49 39.19 B: there are all especially on the [noise] lower grade school system 

40.17 41.16 B: [noise] from 

41.61 43.27 B: kindergarten 

44.01 45.96 B: for the elementary sides 

46.97 47.91 A: really 

47.00 53.41 B: some of the complaints that i have been ah received for many of this are fundraisings 

53.86 60.89 B: most of these funds are just soliciting around areas er ah that's ah the problem that i in 

61.71 66.49 B: i understand that most of these people are are having complaining about 

67.84 70.43 B: [noise] ah also some of these ah 

67.88 68.79 A: (( that )) 

71.26 77.28 B: ah school system that i have been looking into it is just ah still ah 

77.39 81.34 B: ah existing some of the ratios ah ah 

81.36 82.99 B: problems around 

83.13 84.63 B: these systems 

84.97 91.64 B: ah that's the only thing that i can be able to talk about and [noise] and there's some other things that there's some issues 

91.82 105.15 B: there are very eh populated that mostly some of the educations they stop from ah producing values from the kids sometimes they they couldn't even ah find out what the kids' value 

105.73 108.93 B: [noise] you know what's their value has been ah [noise] 

105.95 107.03 A: right 

110.04 117.27 A: right though the question would also be er or is a school a place for them to learn their values or is that something you learn at home 

116.90 117.97 B: yes 

117.63 119.87 A: because it they can only s- 

118.47 130.44 B: now um the probably the most important value is from home if that's that's where they come on and and when they come outside some of this value are not producing into the ah 

122.16 123.38 A: right 

130.86 134.98 B: ah in the proper manners because they see some of these things that look like ah 

135.31 143.34 B: you know it's just not not the way they have been taught from home they just see some other kind of ah different things or 

143.74 146.26 B: so that's that's what i'm talking about 

147.12 151.44 A: right well yeah i agree with that ah 

151.58 159.19 A: you mentioned a fundraising part are you talking about like when the kids have to go trying to raise money for for especial events 

158.69 164.56 B: well it's i i believe in this because some of the systems are are coming from different states 

164.66 172.94 B: and especially some of the states they're using ah some kind of a a lottery for funding some of the school 

172.55 173.74 A: right 

173.15 178.47 B: and even some of the the public schools are still existing this funding thing [noise] 

178.53 190.67 B: so that's another thing that i would not be able to agree if they have some of this ah percentage going to the school where are they why are the why are the school dis- 

190.37 194.29 A: well because now they say since you're getting money from 

194.18 208.30 A: the lottery system for example we don't need to give you as much money as we did before because now you have this other source of income so it's not additional money any more it it's kind of off setting 

207.86 213.02 B: [mn] yes [noise] ah ah some of some of this fundraising [noise] 

208.38 211.12 A: you know how much they were getting from the state 

216.28 217.44 A: go ahead 

216.93 225.71 B: ah ah some of this fundraising's e- e- i believe because if we look into it some other thi- it's just like ah advertising some other type of business 

225.87 239.99 B: and and those are the are the other issues that come out e- in e- e- it's like it's like business in the sometime you're not solic- you are soliciting in other f- in the kids can m- go 

239.97 244.56 B: knocking through doors things like this and then going through the publics 

244.62 248.85 B: those are are things that could the kid can can ah you know 

248.70 260.41 B: can be heard of doing some of these activities and and those are the some of the questions that will be coming up i'd say they would why what happened or they were doing fundraising on the street or something like this 

256.92 258.13 A: would yeah 

259.87 263.59 A: they need to come up with creative ways to try to raise money 

263.10 264.09 B: yes 

263.65 267.18 A: whether it's having ah let's say coca cola 

267.34 271.95 A: be the only soda sold on campus in exchange for money 

272.02 281.74 B: is it notice on the east used to have we're looking at so if if if they want a a do something like that so so that would be able to have all kind of different things 

281.68 296.67 B: if e- e- you know should be have ah for using for the fundraising not just ah candies not disco or other thing so those are the things they open to the to whatever the want to raise the fundraising whatever they use to raise the fundraising 

297.44 298.32 B: so 

297.47 302.75 A: yeah i not i don't really care for the idea of having the kids trying to raise money to have enough ah 

302.96 311.72 A: the put in enough time at school then they have homework and now they need to also go out and try to make money 

306.86 307.62 B: yes 

309.88 317.64 B: yeah that's a that's a su- some of those things that's why i i ah i agree with some of those issues that come out that ah they don't like ah 

317.52 328.52 B: ah doing this fundraising and then they have they say the k- the kids going to sell so much of this now they're doing some kind of a promotion thing then they will receive certain things [mn] 

327.95 330.77 A: right a a trip somewhere 

330.06 331.82 B: [laughter] 

330.87 332.00 A: or 

332.16 334.01 A: i hear you right 

333.25 338.70 B: [mn] so those are the those are the issues that i disagree with many of the school 

338.55 340.70 B: especially public school 

340.54 342.69 B: ah private school 

342.53 355.95 B: ah i m- i monitor some of the private school they really ah donate whatever they have or they do some kind of ah ah garage sales ah those are the things that they can do in there so 

356.20 360.24 B: i i don't have any complaint about them because they have their own own ah 

359.80 362.31 A: oh they have their own income coming in though 

360.94 362.00 B: yes 

363.66 368.76 A: they don't have the as large of a problem with income though as a public school as with income 

368.53 369.65 B: mhm 

369.01 383.68 A: it's hard to blame the public schools for trying to come up with creative ways of coming money when like everyone else they're seeing their budgets decreased but ah i have more problems with the larger class sizes 

384.20 388.90 A: when you have thirty five forty people in a class with only one teacher 

389.27 390.31 B: yes 

389.70 393.18 A: that's harder to control the class or it's harder to 

393.30 395.94 A: to give them individual attention 

396.50 400.52 A: to each each student you know used to be 

399.43 401.94 B: [mn] that's another issue we have 

401.28 409.26 A: right it used to be twenty twenty five students for every teacher and it's easier for them to learn and for the teacher to control the class now 

409.93 413.82 A: some of these public schools you're going up thirty five forty people 

413.93 416.05 B: well that's one gonna [mn] 

416.15 418.99 B: (( most of this issue is is on those )) 

419.19 423.20 B: ah populated area it's like in los angeles 

422.84 424.64 A: right 

423.88 426.70 B: ah i mean san francisco 

426.86 440.30 B: some of those areas in especially from ch- from elementary junior high school high school those are the areas of of education that most need to be educated 

441.19 455.50 B: they they really ah look at and focus and monitor the kids but ah some of this ah things happen with the populated area those are the things that it's going to be difficult control 

441.26 442.08 A: that's 

455.32 458.88 B: they have to have some kind of system of controlling because 

458.89 461.68 B: in the gangster 

462.10 465.19 B: ah most of those those those things and ah 

465.39 467.34 B: and some of these kids they have 

467.33 472.77 B: different environment background and and and mostly those environment background 

469.44 470.51 A: right 

472.77 482.44 B: they they manipulate it and they get together and and some of the teachers they hardly control them because they have different ah different case of of ah a- 

482.66 497.37 B: and some of the some of the teachers have the gifted of knowing how to control them ah those are the those are the very difficult issue that i've been looking around here [laughter] and and and what is really bad about it because 

487.59 488.70 A: right 

493.36 494.33 A: i like it 

497.21 501.82 B: when when you see the kids come out with with those ah very ah ah 

502.36 512.59 B: ah kind of gangster environment and they hang around they got to be ah monitored that kid right in front of the face 

512.77 518.65 B: and they have to understand how to monitor the kid and control that kid 

518.04 520.01 A: (( [mn] right )) 

520.65 523.23 B: because most of the thing happen now is just 

523.24 526.34 B: very bad for the kid to do some kind of ah 

526.61 527.71 B: of ah 

528.11 532.32 B: you know one of this ha- happen nowadays in school killings 

532.61 533.95 B: shootings 

534.12 545.86 B: these are the things that we should be able to control these things and how we can control it this is most of the questions that have been asked they've been they they've been asked for so many populated area 

545.15 547.83 A: well a lot of it is also peer pressure though 

546.41 547.22 B: yes 

547.81 548.97 B: (( and then oh )) 

549.15 556.82 B: how much of of funding are they doing around this kind of school w- how we going to be able to provide the school 

556.78 571.07 B: now we come out with the one teacher for thirty five how many good students then some of this kind of ah ah populated area can be controlled could be a small amount not can have a popu- ah over amount 

570.63 574.75 A: right what happens to the rest um like you said they go onto 

572.62 573.45 B: yes 

575.09 577.62 A: whether it's the gangs or 

577.79 580.73 A: or they become the loners the outcasts 

580.08 583.15 B: yes some of them they should be able to ah ah 

580.99 581.86 A: (( well a )) 

583.29 592.36 B: understand the background of kids ah where do they come from how they being doing this all thing be start screening very early 

592.15 595.05 A: lot of that's also parental control 

594.75 599.95 B: yes because when it come up to the higher level it's going to be hard to control they can isolate it
