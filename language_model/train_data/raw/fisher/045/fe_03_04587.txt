73.41 75.11 A: yeah [laughter] 

74.36 78.95 B: i mean i i guess i'm not trying to say i'm cheap i'm just saying gosh there's 

79.26 81.26 B: there's so many movies out 

81.84 85.65 B: so many different types of movies that uh 

83.89 84.94 A: yeah 

86.34 97.41 B: as a whole's a lot to me a lot of the uh seem like the secular popular ones are very violent and we're uh 

97.86 101.21 B: uh parents of four younger kids which 

101.41 102.80 B: we can't go to 

102.96 104.46 A: right 

104.07 108.98 B: and that's best for us uh not to uh expose them to that so 

109.02 111.94 B: our movies are are a lot 

112.36 114.13 B: more i guess uh 

114.43 117.54 B: vanilla but family based 

117.12 124.26 A: right oh my kids are are a little more liberal than that and uh they've turned out great 

118.26 119.55 B: (( so oh that's great )) 

124.27 125.53 B: oh that's great 

124.42 127.07 A: uh my oldest son is uh 

127.57 129.69 A: in the at the university of washington 

129.75 137.46 A: he's a grade a student gets on the dean list all the dean's list all the time and my second son is uh 

137.57 150.56 A: also a grade a student and he is getting ready to go to college so they turned out you know non violent they don't smoke drink or any of that stuff so you know that type of movie hasn't really affect them that much 

146.87 148.03 B: well that's good 

150.51 152.99 B: that's good well that's you know and it's 

153.40 156.14 B: i guess once again it's it's how 

156.17 160.33 B: uh they're brought up one and and what their own 

160.37 161.32 B: uh 

161.43 174.01 B: uh values and choices that they make you know i i don't think it's gonna be the the movies or anything that's gonna really change it i it it's just that it seems like a lot of more a lot more violent than 

175.02 178.02 B: uh what we were used to seeing when we were younger 

177.29 181.31 A: oh yeah that's definitely that's definitely true 

178.81 179.81 B: (( yeah and there's )) 

181.07 189.14 B: you know that that's all the way across the board but i guess that's just a sign of the times there are some good movies out there um 

191.04 197.62 B: i can't tell you the last movie that i saw i think that was one of the questions is uh they said does 

197.97 200.10 B: i think we saw um 

199.27 200.50 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

201.21 207.72 B: beloved which was a an oprah movie and my wife and i sort of walked away scratching our head 

208.00 210.19 B: why did we go to that movie [laughter] 

210.27 212.22 B: and that was several years ago 

212.97 215.40 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] what what what movie did you say 

215.48 217.58 B: the name of it was beloved 

217.47 218.33 A: oh 

218.59 220.14 A: i'm not familiar with that one 

218.72 219.85 B: and 

220.22 223.97 B: yeah and it well y- you didn't miss a thing the way 

223.22 225.65 A: oh [laughter] okay 

224.39 238.65 B: you didn't uh we were we were really up for it because both of us do like oprah i mean it it's uh uh i i have my times i do i have my times that she's you know wasting everybody's time but that's neither here or there 

238.63 239.70 B: (( uh the )) 

240.96 242.58 B: most of the movies 

242.78 254.81 B: we'll see if they're we have cable and there's a lot of movies there's turner classic movies and then there's hallmark and and there's uh so many others that we can see that 

250.72 252.05 A: right 

255.73 263.37 B: granted it's not like seeing 'em in a big movie house but uh like you said i'd rather stay home and uh 

263.63 277.00 B: with the cost of movies now that's almost a must for us with four kids and you know ourselves you're you're talking about six people that would uh you would cut into a hundred dollars real easy there you know 

264.71 265.61 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

269.94 271.74 A: [sigh] oh sure 

275.99 277.32 A: easy 

277.08 282.16 B: yeah so and that would be on the cheap end that would be saying no to a lot of things 

282.40 284.13 A: yeah 

283.29 291.16 B: but uh no i i still think there's a lot of good movies made they're far and in between you know but uh 

291.90 300.01 B: it seems like the mindset of the movie makers uh are if it doesn't get out there and really 

300.34 301.30 B: uh 

302.10 305.43 B: you know make a lot of money they just 

306.27 309.83 A: well you know that's the key i mean they're they're after the bucks 

310.10 319.01 A: whatever whatever s- whatever sells the the best i mean if it's if it's violence and and sex then that's that's what they'll be doing 

313.73 314.64 B: yeah 

319.30 330.86 B: it also seems like a lot of the movies a long time ago would stay and run at the movie houses for weeks or months on end and like i said now 

330.74 335.20 B: if they're not making them any money they pull them and go to something else 

334.97 336.14 A: yeah that's true 

336.33 337.31 B: so 

336.61 338.32 A: pay per view is uh 

338.96 341.15 A: nabs those things pretty quick 

340.35 352.68 B: yes mhm you know and there's a there's a lot of things that i think that've hurt the the movie business too it's like you said pay per view there's d._v._d.s there's all kinds of tapes that you can rent uh 

351.80 352.69 A: right 

352.81 355.14 B: from the blockbuster or 

355.51 360.43 B: wherever you go but uh we can get 'em from the library here you know so 

360.18 361.17 A: sure 

360.49 369.72 B: uh there's so many different avenues to to do that that uh not unless you were just real hooked on 

370.33 377.61 B: on the movies uh you could save a lot of money by taking any of those other avenues 

378.83 380.10 A: yeah that's true 

381.42 382.77 B: but um 

383.20 388.04 B: i used to like a lot of the older black and movies in fact i still do 

387.27 392.74 A: oh yeah me too yeah actually i still do i'll watch one of those every now and then 

393.85 396.35 A: in fact i watched one day before yesterday 

396.21 398.03 B: and what was that 

397.51 398.79 A: it was uh 

398.96 400.62 A: (( oh what the hell was it )) 

404.36 407.86 A: i don't remember the name of it i caught it about half way into it 

407.43 408.36 B: did you 

408.56 415.14 B: i didn't get to watch one which i had seen once before which was uh how green is my valley 

414.63 416.53 A: oh yeah 

416.29 424.34 B: an an old i think roddy mcdowell is a little boy and uh there's some of the other uh 

424.74 427.97 B: movie stars in it about an 

428.58 440.11 B: an irish village that was uh coal mining and uh and how uh rough the times were back uh i guess before the turn of the last century 

440.30 442.02 A: yeah 

441.18 449.09 B: but uh there's there's so many uh good movies it's funny that you i can't think of any right off hand now but there's you know 

449.12 453.87 B: there's uh so many classic movies that uh we both 

453.88 457.73 B: that that uh you know are definitely uh 

458.79 461.15 B: i'm sure are etched in both of our minds 

462.37 464.11 A: yeah 

466.23 467.54 B: but uh 

467.68 468.92 B: i guess
