0.29 1.51 A: hello 

0.88 2.20 B: hi 

1.88 3.28 A: hi there 

2.68 4.20 B: i'm clementine 

4.01 5.36 A: clementine 

4.92 9.51 B: clementine oh my darling oh my darling [laughter] 

6.92 10.77 A: [laughter] oh clementine my name is louis 

10.16 12.12 B: hi louis how are you 

11.50 13.04 A: (( fine how are you doing )) 

12.54 14.14 B: fine thank you 

13.80 17.27 A: so what are your feelings so far about affirmative action 

16.29 21.70 B: [noise] well i have many opinions but i think i would like to um 

22.04 25.89 B: i think it's really very good that we do have affirmative action 

25.95 30.67 B: but it is not always promising when it comes to different races of people 

30.27 31.27 A: (( yeah uh-huh uh-huh )) 

31.02 34.55 B: all right and i'll see what you've got to say 

35.39 42.87 A: well uh i'm for it uh 'course yeah i think many times you have to consider the 

43.20 46.88 A: uh individual circumstances i suppose 

46.26 47.93 B: mhm 

47.25 51.06 A: [lipsmack] and l- like you i agree that it's not always promising 

51.46 59.42 A: but uh [sigh] i think you have to take each and every uh circumstance under its own merit and uh 

59.71 61.06 A: uh 

61.68 63.86 A: and take it from there i think 

63.08 74.76 B: right i'm prone to agree with that because there's so much that is going on here uh you know we have so many entities that we deal with in our lives in our communities at our jobs 

74.80 76.25 B: and its 

76.75 78.26 B: ever present 

78.77 89.86 B: always just just constant and its constantly changing it's something that is not going to remain the same it's something that's going to change and but it it's good that people can take time to 

79.66 80.76 A: (( so right mm )) 

90.37 93.64 B: work on things in um 

93.90 95.45 B: a positive manner 

95.62 104.85 B: and to have affirmative action working behind you working with you doing the it's it's promising and it gives you a little motivation and a little of uh inspiration 

105.06 107.60 B: you know i like it um 

108.18 110.27 B: [noise] oh like that 

110.58 116.76 B: oh i should not have said on the phone have to go to the bathroom but i'm not going to do that might hold it tight talk my ten minutes 

112.44 113.78 A: (( mm uh-huh )) 

114.37 115.27 A: (( good oh )) 

116.08 118.82 A: [laughter] 

117.01 122.50 B: (( [laughter] that's what i think i must do anyway why did i get on the telephone )) 

121.89 123.28 A: [laughter] 

122.31 127.54 B: my god it came on so quickly but it's all right you know i didn't um 

127.33 140.74 B: i was told anyway that as soon as i called it probably wouldn't take me today because the pin number might not go through so i think i was looking at the negative [laughter] i don't think that was wonderful i shouldn't have done that 

134.35 135.96 A: (( mm )) 

136.24 138.97 A: (( uh-huh okay [laughter] okay [laughter] )) 

141.20 145.06 B: oh but anyway [lipsmack] so um what type of work do you do 

145.02 149.81 A: i'm in sales and marketing the i'm out in the cali- the state of california where are you 

149.44 151.44 B: i'm in malverna new york 

150.86 153.42 A: (( oh okay that's okay )) 

151.72 156.47 B: okay so they hook us up like that this is quite interesting 

154.04 155.43 A: (( yeah )) 

155.92 158.03 A: ver- very much so 

157.18 163.38 B: and being so this job is um from a college i wonder how they actually feel about it 

163.66 165.64 B: uh you know [laughter] 

164.62 173.09 A: uh it's hard to say because i'm sure that you know you you can sit a hundred people down and you're going to get various views and opinions 

172.49 173.81 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

173.48 176.19 A: um [sigh] [lipsmack] 

176.97 182.12 A: and for the sake of trying to be objective about the whole thing uh uh 

182.46 184.23 A: (( uh )) 

184.71 190.83 A: i i think just like we had said y- you have to take ea- each each circumstance on its own 

191.46 197.50 A: [lipsmack] and look at it from that point of view however overall i think affirmative action is good uh 

197.76 207.23 B: yeah because it's a good outlook that that we do have you know if you have an affirmative outlook that is a positive thing and that's what i love about it and 

201.12 202.30 A: (( uh-huh )) 

204.57 205.60 A: mhm 

207.13 211.42 A: and it gives you a level playing field to some degree i would think 

210.80 212.82 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

211.84 212.87 A: so 

213.02 215.67 A: forever for all concerned so 

216.23 223.68 A: personally i'm for it uh there there's nothing that's one hundred percent there's no such thing as utopia 

223.52 224.41 B: mhm 

223.60 232.08 A: you're going to have problems or whatever endeavour in life that we embark upon but i think for the most part it it's good 

228.89 230.02 B: mhm 

231.89 243.72 B: yes and um if we had an argument but if i was in favor of the [lipsmack] oh let's see when i was in college i was thinking about uh what was it moral majority 

243.51 244.45 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

244.34 252.68 B: and it was a topic of the day and my teacher says well is anyone here a part of the moral majority you know 

252.92 259.46 B: and i said i don't know am i [laughter] i i i i really didn't know 

254.77 257.65 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

259.01 260.43 A: (( right mhm )) 

259.67 260.91 B: and um 

261.07 264.46 B: i sat back and i listened to the rest of the students and 

265.12 277.97 B: i said well i think i am a member of the moral majority well the classmates looked at me but you know i can be an advocate at times because i am very firm and steadfast with what i believe in 

269.07 270.27 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

278.18 280.95 B: and if i 

281.54 286.87 B: think that that is something wonderful i'm going for it wholeheartedly despite what anyone says 

286.68 287.80 A: right 

287.26 288.99 B: you know so 

289.85 295.25 B: this affirmative action comes out in a favor- favorable way in that 

295.54 303.41 B: it gives me the power to speak or to be able to go ahead in my direction of positivity 

297.75 298.91 A: (( mhm absolutely mhm )) 

303.62 307.41 B: you know or um to just 

308.40 314.39 B: be able to go on with my life just being the me that i am you know what i mean 

312.82 313.89 A: uh-huh 

313.92 315.21 A: absolutely 

314.56 316.07 B: yeah so 

316.10 318.70 B: um i i i think that's kind of cool 

318.71 321.48 A: uh i think it is because the 

321.50 332.13 A: other alternative is uh hypothetically speaking if you were to remove affirmative action that i just see as taking a step backwards uh as to where we once were 

331.68 335.01 B: mhm mhm few steps 

332.80 339.02 A: and that's no good yes i mean absolutely [laughter] uh-oh [laughter] 

335.77 337.68 B: (( [laughter] )) 

338.41 339.72 B: (( we would )) 

339.36 340.31 A: (( uh )) 

339.73 345.57 B: and i don't think um any of us even nowadays want to really go back like that you know it would be 

344.67 345.44 A: (( we )) 

345.46 353.56 A: we don't but i i you know there are s- those who do because there's there's a lot of pro and con on affirmative action 

352.96 354.33 B: (( yes yeah mhm mhm )) 

353.75 360.40 A: and there are those out there who would love to see us go back into time and and see things as they once were 

360.74 367.30 A: uh but uh fortunately those people hopefully will not get their way [laughter] [laughter] 

364.83 366.05 B: i hope not 

366.43 372.50 B: but i would argue why wouldn't they want it you know why wouldn't you want affirmative action 

372.42 375.12 A: well [sigh] mhm 

374.14 375.89 B: i don't know why 

375.98 377.45 B: i i just don't 

378.81 379.89 B: (( do you know [noise] )) 

379.51 385.45 A: i would think that those who are against it are somewhat biased 

385.63 386.90 B: well we are too 

387.40 394.02 A: uh we're biased for it yeah uh-huh but um mhm yeah 

389.14 391.57 B: yes yes mhm 

394.78 396.01 B: what would it 

396.02 397.14 B: harm 

397.28 411.31 B: how does it harm a person when i start weighing my pros and cons i i always ask myself in everything i do how is it going to benefit me am i going to learn something from it you know um w- will it benefit me 

405.79 406.72 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

411.26 412.45 A: (( mhm )) 

411.85 417.43 B: i i want to know and if it does okay and if it doesn't why doesn't it benefit me 

418.35 419.08 B: [sigh] 

419.19 427.80 B: and then i come up with my little answer and then i can be very positive in my negative statement [laughter] or that when i have something to say 

423.93 426.39 A: [laughter] 

427.50 429.16 A: (( uh-huh you're )) 

427.92 436.13 B: [laughter] you know so i tell you so um [lipsmack] i guess now you are over the college age aren't you 

429.75 430.52 A: (( right uh-huh )) 

435.72 437.05 A: (( yes i am uh-huh uh-huh )) 

436.25 439.49 B: i can hear it in your voice and i'm sure you can hear it in mine 

438.26 439.70 A: (( um )) 

439.78 443.40 B: and um are you in a college state uh

450.03 451.32 A: [laughter] 

453.76 460.71 A: [laughter] well believe me i'm not [laughter] 

462.10 475.93 A: i i i pretty much you know be on the outside looking looking in and looking at all how things are going and just shake my head many times and you know and just take it from there 

467.55 468.56 B: (( mhm )) 

475.45 476.50 B: uh-huh 

476.02 477.95 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

477.04 487.02 B: wow i i [laughter] i i don't know i just when i hear of california i think about [mn] about a million things at one time 

486.90 488.71 A: [laughter] 

487.74 489.02 B: and 

489.55 492.28 B: um in the work that i do 

492.56 496.02 B: i first thing that came to my mind was gangs 

495.73 497.05 A: (( oh okay )) 

496.29 501.82 B: california gangs then i thought about my brothers who live out there then i thought about the earthquakes 

497.42 498.79 A: oh well 

501.57 502.85 A: (( okay )) 

502.24 512.66 B: out of all those are well one one positive connotation and two negatives [laughter] so i don't want to run down there for the earthquake and i don't want to get beat up by anyone in a gang 

506.92 508.17 A: [laughter] 

512.30 513.92 A: uh-huh uh-huh so 

512.89 516.45 B: but i do want to go see my brothers you know [laughter] which i've never been

517.48 520.33 B: i have um one in l._a. one in nevada 

520.13 521.52 A: (( what oh okay )) 

520.91 528.02 B: and um my brother um peewee ocean something he just moved from there he wasn't there for a long time ocean something another 

528.34 531.47 B: so i don't remember where that was he's in texas now so 

531.16 532.38 A: oh oh okay 

531.73 543.82 B: i don't know and um my oldest my oldest brother has been down there like twenty years and he keeps trying to get me there i say honey i'm await for you to come up this year you know i'm not going [laughter] i'm 

543.98 545.57 B: afraid of earthquakes 

545.37 546.66 A: oh okay 

546.34 547.90 B: you know so 

548.02 556.65 B: um i don't know how affirmative action would fit that programme [noise] at all so far as i was concerned [laughter] not with that i 

556.84 558.81 B: really don't think 

558.48 559.59 A: (( [laughter] yeah nope )) 

558.85 559.81 B: but um 

559.89 564.35 B: now you got to help me with the conversation that we have to stand here ten minutes so you know you ever 

562.75 573.07 A: yeah we're we're almost done too but uh yeah in insofar as earthquakes and affirmative action are concerned they're at opposite ends of the pole i would think 

565.30 568.19 B: [laughter] 

572.74 573.90 B: mhm 

573.28 574.94 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

574.06 581.22 B: but if we can assert ourselves in in a manner of what we believe in or what we want or just the truth itself 

581.05 582.30 A: (( mhm )) 

581.61 582.81 B: then 

583.11 587.17 B: that is the way it should be that's my belief 

587.26 598.04 B: and i think we can continue on um [mn] well i- i- it gets to me when it comes to affirmative action it kind of comes to a reli- a religious kind of thing 

597.74 598.78 A: (( uh-huh )) 

599.24 599.95 B: (( and the truth )) 

599.34 599.89 A: or
