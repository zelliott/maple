6.26 8.41 B: oh i'm doing pretty good yourself 

8.22 9.56 A: i'm okay 

9.63 12.77 A: what part of the country are you [mn] from 

12.19 13.96 B: i'm from oregon yourself 

14.17 15.19 A: l._a. 

15.65 16.36 B: (( oh [lipsmack] )) 

15.70 18.83 A: california southern california 

19.99 22.69 B: my father grew up down in san diego 

22.84 25.77 A: oh that place has changed tremendously 

26.93 29.40 A: [mn] i'm sure you know that 

28.62 30.22 B: [noise] yeah [laughter] 

30.24 31.15 A: are you on a 

30.48 31.25 B: (( been down )) 

31.32 32.82 A: are you on a speaker phone 

32.96 34.62 B: yes i am [noise] 

33.95 35.11 A: (( oh okay )) 

35.74 40.31 A: okay to the topic of affirmative action [sigh] in the workplace 

42.24 44.87 A: what are your thoughts on that 

44.37 46.29 B: i think that it h- 

46.48 48.74 B: it has the right idea 

49.03 53.65 B: but i also think that some of the effects that we've seen are 

54.35 61.45 B: a bit negative because [noise] we've kind of moved from the original intent of affirmative action to [sigh] 

61.55 71.61 B: in a sense you also have an argument that you could say that it's bad because it takes people that are less qualified than others just because they have to fill a 

71.64 75.49 B: minority spot that the affirmative action 

75.57 76.91 B: would bring in 

78.11 86.17 A: okay well uh j- the thing is that when they said the workplace they did not emphasize 

86.40 91.74 A: what type of workplace [mn] be it public sector or governmental 

91.81 93.02 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

93.11 94.77 B: (( yeah )) 

93.72 95.30 A: (( [sigh] governmental )) 

95.34 98.66 A: is pretty much um [sigh] civil service 

99.00 100.35 A: right 

100.88 103.16 A: and that is tremendously 

103.57 104.56 A: um 

105.31 106.89 A: affirmative action 

106.96 114.37 A: i mean pretty much a civil service job you know is a a hundred percent ci- affirmative action i you probably know that 

113.69 115.44 B: yeah 

114.95 117.30 A: in the private sector 

117.69 121.42 A: affirmative action at least here in l._a. 

121.90 122.93 A: um 

123.13 131.87 A: it it it really is not as much a factor as it was maybe [lipsmack] ten or fifteen years back 

132.32 136.47 A: probably due to the fact that l._a. is um [sigh] 

137.84 143.45 A: well there's sixty different languages spoken in this area you know what i mean 

142.16 142.96 B: mm 

143.58 145.70 B: [sigh] yeah 

144.64 147.38 A: so i mean if if you own a business 

147.85 154.05 A: in the private sector and you run an ad in the newspaper help wanted 

154.25 159.99 A: the chances of you uh having a per- a caucasian apply for the job is rather remote 

161.38 163.10 A: right 

162.88 164.50 B: yeah 

163.91 164.85 A: (( i )) 

165.93 167.91 A: mean myself uh 

168.58 169.98 A: (( i i think )) 

170.81 175.91 A: i agree with you i think it is a a concept that has pretty much um 

176.07 177.64 A: gone the distance 

178.13 179.16 A: um 

180.06 186.24 A: i i don't know if it is really practised very much in the military for instance 

186.54 191.37 A: as far as promotions and such do you have any idea about 

195.22 201.23 B: [sigh] i don't know i have i have pictures in my head of the movie lone star 

196.77 200.65 A: (( that )) 

202.04 204.70 B: um i don't know if you're familiar with that or not 

204.19 207.89 A: oh man i haven't been to movies in years [laughter] 

208.10 215.84 B: it's a fairly old movie and [lipsmack] and it probably only focuses on the around culture in [sigh] 

215.87 217.27 B: um texas 

217.46 227.67 B: or i mean around um mexicans americans and mexican americans and in general like immigration and crossing over and stuff like that and 

227.85 236.72 B: [noise] there's a there's a feeling in it [noise] where one of the units that's [noise] stationed in the area that 

236.88 240.01 B: they're there and their unit is an 

240.47 249.13 B: all colored unit and they're there as kind of a offset no one else really wants to be there so you guys get to go there and so i can kind of see 

250.50 256.30 B: [mn] how it's kind of showing that basically from that you end up having 

256.45 259.40 B: this division between 

260.28 270.70 B: even if you have people that are in higher positions they even still tend to get put in the less desirable places than those that are of the 

270.92 271.83 B: race 

271.17 272.76 A: less qualified 

272.74 280.42 B: ethnic background uh and the people that are of the ace the race or ethnic background you prefer 

280.44 283.77 B: that tend to get [lipsmack] more of what they want 

284.60 291.64 A: yeah i i i concur and also um i might note that here in california 

292.50 300.10 A: two years ago a proposition was passed to end affirmative hiring in the workplace 

300.47 303.97 A: it was actually passed by a majority vote 

304.25 305.97 B: (( [noise] hm that )) 

305.39 311.71 A: and it was taken into the court [sigh] and kicked out because it was um 

312.43 314.96 A: supposedly illegal right 

315.97 317.51 A: so it 

317.01 319.77 B: that affirmative action was or that the law 

319.67 330.61 A: the law the the proposition that [sigh] i mean this thing got over seventy percent of the public vote to end affirmative action in california 

326.36 327.40 B: (( uh-huh )) 

329.94 331.13 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

331.30 343.68 A: [sigh] and then the the losers took it to the uh appeals court they took it to the court system and ultimately the court sy- the higher court ruled that it was um 

344.25 348.87 A: they couldn't do that it was illegal to have that on the ballot in the first place 

349.53 351.61 A: so it was shot down 

351.89 360.03 B: that's nuts because i mean it shows especially when you have not even just right at the margin of a like a fifty fifty that 

359.09 361.12 A: right so the majority vote 

361.39 362.48 A: exactly 

362.58 364.94 B: a clear majority i mean it's not like it's 

363.97 366.21 A: exactly over seventy percent [sigh] 

367.02 367.95 B: not like it 

367.07 374.16 A: and i mean you know you got to think about it 'cause california seventy percent of california is not all caucasian 

374.25 375.97 B: yeah 

375.39 380.68 A: i mean that that what's happening is affirmative action is actually backfiring 

380.89 384.36 A: on the people that it was originally meant for 

384.49 387.91 A: which was the blacks in the sixties 

388.73 389.62 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

389.34 393.49 A: i mean this was a this this was the brainchild of lyndon johnson you know 

398.35 402.10 A: and i- i- it just um it's pretty much gone its distance 

402.66 404.01 A: in my opinion 

405.13 407.06 A: what do you think 

408.36 409.24 B: well 

409.33 412.03 B: i definitely think that the heart's in the right place 

412.12 417.67 B: but like a lot of things implementation is kind of lacking because 

417.75 421.83 B: you get in effect you take when it first started and you have it 

422.07 436.03 B: whenever with anything you have a difference which we know that are around in the environment and which aren't and then you have the after effects of those people that are around with it being commonplace 

436.02 441.51 B: instead of groundbreaking and you have an af- a kind of 

441.57 444.51 B: i don't know generational gap i guess 

444.62 446.61 B: between the people 

446.68 451.44 B: that it was meant for and the environment that it was breaking through to begin with 

451.49 460.02 B: and then people coming by later on and saying why do we need that because they are they're so used to having it that they don't even understand wh- so needful 

459.97 473.64 B: in the first place and so instead it just is another tool to be used for one purpose or another for good or for bad instead of actually understanding why it might be needed and how it should be used in the first place 

473.83 483.76 A: [sigh] yeah exactly and you know like considering that this concept was created during the civil rights movement which was really good that it was done [sigh] 

483.79 488.97 A: i think that they should emphasize that in certain regions of the country where there is 

489.11 493.49 A: imbalances in employment you know like um [sigh] 

492.00 492.84 B: yeah 

493.61 495.93 A: like say maybe idaho 

496.10 497.54 A: or something like that if 

498.53 500.22 A: that makes any sense 

500.44 501.87 B: yeah it does 

501.83 506.33 A: i mean because here in california i mean it clearly i mean um 

507.02 508.08 A: you know 

508.70 510.23 A: the majority 

511.12 520.09 A: what was once the considered minorities i mean you know you have a heavy asian population hispanic population you know what i mean 

520.13 522.67 A: and and they put i i mean 

520.45 521.27 B: yeah 

524.31 530.81 A: i i think they ought to look in at it regionally i mean it's a governmental type thing but 

533.44 538.35 A: [mn] you know i haven't really given it much though but you know other than what i've read in the papers 

541.48 543.20 B: yeah [sigh] 

545.23 548.82 B: i try not to read the news or watch the news 

548.92 553.08 B: if anything truly important is happening i'll end up hearing from lots 

552.38 555.49 A: you will that's right that's very true 

555.52 560.63 B: that that's how i get my news if something that important enough is happening i'll find out 

556.15 556.71 A: (( [noise] )) 

560.05 563.28 A: i can relate to that i don't even own a t._v. 

563.94 567.13 B: i do but the only thing that it gets used for is 

566.50 567.60 A: sports 

567.99 569.89 B: -ing movies [mn] 

569.90 572.15 A: how about sports [laughter] 

572.28 579.00 B: nope not even sports the only thing i'm rip- when it comes to sports is i got into playing water polo back when i was still in high school 

575.54 578.27 A: (( [laughter] )) 

579.03 581.81 A: yeah [laughter] yeah i know 

580.72 586.47 B: went through to college and and even still now working at the pool i work at 

588.75 589.95 A: but um 

590.24 592.91 A: (( you know i i i h- i think maybe um [sigh] )) 

594.04 599.95 A: the affirmative i i just think the affirmative action issue it needs to be reworked i
