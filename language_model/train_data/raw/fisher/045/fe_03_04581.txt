8.51 11.29 B: oh not too bad so you're a big movie guy 

10.17 11.00 A: (( uh )) 

11.41 18.22 A: [noise] yeah i love the movies actually don't get to uh do do you like 'em

17.41 21.53 B: yeah i i love going come on well you know well i mean good movies yeah 

19.57 23.18 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah who doesn't 

22.88 25.33 B: yeah exactly [noise] 

25.63 29.53 A: (( how much do you uh do you go out to the movies more do you rent 'em more what do you do )) 

29.39 42.73 B: well i don't really rent anything 'cause i i think that's just wasting my money but i i do buy quite a few movies but then also if there's something that needs to be seen in the theater such as like the new matrix movie or something i i will definitely make the trek out to go see it 

35.56 36.46 A: oh really 

43.14 47.26 A: right on but you into buying you buy more movies than you rent huh 

44.11 45.29 B: like i think so- 

46.97 50.11 B: oh yeah i haven't rented a movie in in years 

47.95 49.18 A: yeah 

49.68 51.04 A: really wow 

50.74 55.79 B: yeah because i'll forget to take it back and then by the time you pay for the late fee you may as well have bought it exactly 

55.55 68.44 A: exactly exactly yeah that's really true 'cause i end up uh you know i'm pretty busy so i ended up end up like being like a day or two late every time i rent a movie and it ends up being about ten ten twelve bucks anyway so 

67.35 74.05 B: ten twelve bucks if you just kind of bargain shop and and y- you get your movies on line or something you usually get 'em for about that price so 

73.26 75.27 A: yeah true 

74.67 79.06 B: and then you own it forever and if it's good enough to watch once it's probably good enough to watch a few times 

78.90 86.60 A: [laughter] exactly exactly do you have an any idea do you know anything about the movies before you buy 'em or do you just buy movies that you've seen before or what do you do 

86.45 101.20 B: well i read a lot of on line you know i read what other people have liked or you know like i probably i would say most movies i have i have seen in the theater but then there are some movies i i've bought just on a recommendation and it turned out you know that they were really good
