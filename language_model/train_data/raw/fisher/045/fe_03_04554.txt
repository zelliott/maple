0.63 4.25 A: hello are you out there [sigh] who am i talking to 

1.77 3.26 B: yeah 

3.73 5.36 B: uh my name's robert 

5.09 6.88 A: hi robert my name's john 

7.50 9.18 A: [sigh] so what do you think 

8.75 16.59 B: oh [sigh] well [sigh] i don't know i think there is a lot of good arguments for and against affirmative action honestly [sigh] um 

17.71 27.69 B: [sigh] i don't know i i think i i have a lot of problems with the way that it's uh implemented sometimes like especially 'cause i've i've worked in several capacities for the the state of georgia 

27.47 28.44 A: (( [noise] [noise] okay [noise] )) 

27.93 32.33 B: uh and i'm i'm currently in employ at the at the georgia tech actually 

32.36 33.41 B: um 

33.52 39.64 B: and i mean even even there it it does come into play to a certain extent like it just it's 

40.22 46.63 B: i mean it it's good to see a good ethnic balance you know of of various races or whatever in the workplace 

46.25 47.34 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

46.72 58.94 B: but you know sometimes it really sucks you know to have to hire one candidate over another you know who may be more skilled you know just because they happen to black or hispanic or asian or whatever 

58.21 69.97 A: [noise] [noise] yep [noise] yep i completely agree i think uh [sigh] i think it has its place but i think uh you know first and foremost companies are in business to make money [sigh] and to put you know good teams together [sigh] 

69.81 83.92 A: and i think uh skill sets have to be matched and i think you can [sigh] you can achieve these these quotas [sigh] by recruiting highly talented uh you know minorities and so forth so i think if if that's kind of uh 

84.54 91.66 A: maybe [mn] where things are going i would be more in support of it but uh [sigh] you know it i think i i agree with you there's good points and bad points 

89.20 91.77 B: it never it never seems to turn to turn out that way 

92.54 95.27 B: i'm sorry go ahead [laughter] 

93.70 95.92 A: oh no that's okay i didn't hear what you said [noise] 

95.53 99.73 B: oh i said it you know that it it never it never seems to turn out that way 

99.65 113.66 A: [sigh] it's unfortunate and uh [sigh] because uh [mn] you know i believe in the power of diversity i think it can really get a a great team together [sigh] but at [noise] the same time you have to [noise] bring a skilled team together and you can't you can't make it so that it becomes a crutch 

113.49 117.11 A: and and one [noise] one or two individuals are holding down the team [sigh] 

117.15 118.34 A: and uh 

118.56 125.04 A: i think that's that's what you really see or hear a lot in the news and and that's why people have a knock at it [sigh] 

125.07 127.85 A: but uh yeah how would how do you think [sigh] how do you 

128.38 137.03 A: how do you get quotas filled but at the same time make sure that they're high qual- high caliber teammates or work associates or [noise] 

136.52 140.86 B: yeah i mean that's that's that's kind of the problem right there um 

141.47 156.40 B: i mean unfortunately you know you can't just go after you know a set of people with a given given demographic or whatever [sigh] and just say you know all right i want you know ten african american applic- uh applicants and i want ten hispanic applicants and i want ten white [sigh] 

156.29 158.10 B: applicants like [sigh] 

158.14 161.23 B: you know you're kind of at the mercy of whoever sends you a resume 

161.24 162.30 B: so 

162.82 168.44 B: you know sometimes possibly because of the environment you know the location or 

168.46 176.95 B: you know maybe the the job wasn't publicized very much like [sigh] i mean it's real easy to favor one group over another you know for all sorts of reasons 

174.83 175.54 A: (( mhm )) 

176.54 178.22 A: (( mhm )) 

177.61 178.80 B: um 

181.25 182.45 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] i don't know 

181.36 185.35 A: do you have do you have hiring and firing responsibility where you work 

184.79 193.99 B: oh no no but i've uh i work closely with some of the executives but i i'm just i mean i'm i don't have any power myself [laughter] 

185.60 186.35 A: no 

192.95 205.75 A: yeah [sigh] so i'm wondering how how uh [sigh] do you have a a program in place where uh that that their sole function like in h._r. is to monitor e._e._o. [sigh] and uh [sigh] affirmative action 

205.54 210.04 B: [sigh] uh i'm fairly certain yeah [laughter] 

209.31 224.16 A: 'cause that's that's even kind of another you know that's there's there's a positive 'cause you need some type of enforcement [noise] but at the same time there's a negative because [sigh] you're kind of uh [sigh] you're putting an administrative function in place to kind of police the organization which is really not 

224.00 225.86 A: core business [sigh] 

226.06 229.59 A: they're really not needed to produce a product or to 

229.62 232.43 A: deliver the services you provide you know [sigh] 

232.74 239.30 A: so and it's kind of curious how they [sigh] how they administer it um i i don't have a and hiring 

239.42 243.45 A: capability either so i'm not sure how it's administered at where i work 

242.81 243.47 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] )) 

243.48 246.88 B: yeah [sigh] no i think that would be weird you know 

246.84 260.43 B: because you know normally the hiring is left up to uh you know the manager of a particular department [sigh] you know and there there you have to go strictly on merit [sigh] you know that they go their boss and say hey you know i'd really like to hire this person and your boss says well 

260.50 262.46 B: you know we really have to hire 

262.51 266.57 B: somebody else for this job you know to meet the quota [sigh] um 

268.26 276.69 B: i mean sometimes it's not a big deal um you know and and i'm sure sometimes it works out in you know in favor of the of the talented minorities or whatever but [sigh] 

277.59 278.71 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

277.93 281.76 B: i think i think it gets exploited to a certain extent 

281.20 291.29 A: [sigh] it does [sigh] and it funny funny thing though is uh [laughter] you know what continues down the road the uh the white male will be the uh minority in the workforce 

291.33 293.65 A: so it's it's almost uh 

292.73 306.81 B: you know and i'd i'd i honestly would not even have a problem with that you know if there was sufficient talent you know i mean and i think [sigh] at least on see i work for the for the i._t. department at georgia tech 

306.34 307.17 A: uh-huh 

306.81 316.10 B: um and it's it's actually worked out very well and i honestly don't know if this was due to you know affirmative action or if this was just pure random chance but we have 

316.16 318.42 B: we have several um 

318.69 321.77 B: african american and uh asian 

321.58 322.42 A: uh-huh 

321.89 325.22 B: professionals you know very very high up in the levels of management 

324.92 325.66 A: uh-huh 

325.29 326.43 B: um 

327.58 329.40 B: (( you know i guess )) 

329.45 337.67 B: i don't i i guess i guess we're fortunate you know because it is it is kind of an international school and international environment so it just sort of lends itself to that but 

336.85 338.21 A: (( s- sure [sigh] )) 

337.68 341.76 B: you know as to whether there's somebody actually governing it i'm not really sure [laughter] 

341.78 349.40 B: so you know i guess in that respect you know that's that's one environment where it it has worked well you know whether it was artificial or 

349.50 360.39 B: you know just random chance um you know but i've i've been other environments where it did not work out well you know especially in like [sigh] say like a highschool [sigh] um 

355.59 356.34 A: right 

358.71 359.87 A: mhm 

360.31 370.98 A: [sigh] but you know it getting back then you don't want to stereotype but typically uh i'm in i._t. too i think you get a lot of technical skills uh from you know with asian backgrounds and so forth 

371.13 382.40 A: so it's it's almost uh [sigh] you to some degree you're still you're still giving jobs based on technical skills or management skills of tech- technical concepts 

382.06 383.88 B: right 

382.69 386.90 A: uh it's be interesting to see how that is in other areas you know other departments [sigh] 

386.45 388.42 B: well actually um 

388.91 392.93 B: uh at least in the atlanta area certainly in georgia tech um 

393.01 395.37 B: there's an awful lot of uh 

395.60 396.75 B: indians 

397.52 407.59 A: mm and they're they're traditionally known for being good jobber programmers and [laughter] uh yeah there's a lot of off off shore development going on and that's where a lot of it they really 

397.68 398.54 B: who 

400.76 403.08 B: (( are [laughter] )) 

407.00 412.39 B: microsoft has a has a huge office over there 

410.12 410.90 A: uh-huh 

411.85 420.26 A: [sigh] so it's in some regards that's that's i wonder if that could even be classified as an e._e._o. or [sigh] um [sigh] you know a 

420.37 426.26 A: a because that's purely skilled based in some in some you know corporations 

424.66 425.59 B: right 

426.14 434.87 B: [sigh] right well i mean i guess as far as like i could i could certainly see it working out for like lower skilled employments 

434.35 435.15 A: uh-huh 

434.96 436.64 B: you know um 

437.26 439.92 B: i mean i guess like 

440.29 445.77 B: you know things but you know jobs that don't really require a a college degree and that type of thing um 

444.16 445.22 A: (( sure [sigh] )) 

446.12 449.23 B: you know i mean i i think i think that's pretty fair because you know 

449.27 454.29 B: poor people that you know that either either can't afford or are not able to get a college education 

454.40 466.05 B: [sigh] you know they should [sigh] they should have a a fair opportunity in the workforce you know because they're they're competing against people that don't necessarily have more or less skills you know it's it's jobs that don't require a whole lot of skills 

458.19 460.00 A: to to to make a living yeah 

465.63 477.88 A: sure sure [sigh] but typically those jobs there's probably less uh [sigh] less margin or profit margin and so forth than the businesses [sigh] so it's almost probably more difficult for them t administer 

477.60 479.40 B: right 

477.93 487.30 A: um you know if you think of that you know take it to the lowest level but like a gas station attendant or a or a you know mcdonalds or so forth you you can't really have a [sigh] 

487.63 493.05 A: you know someone on staff whose sole job is just working on e._e._o. or 

493.21 496.78 A: you know affirmative action because that would you know there's just not enough 

498.08 502.18 A: there's [sigh] you know work for them to do a and b. it's not cost effective 

502.12 504.58 B: right [sigh] well 

503.59 510.25 A: but but you're right that's probably the the the place where it's probably i i think best to have it and 

509.72 517.27 B: right you know i mean like you know factory workers custodians [sigh] you know people that work in like uh i mean even retail [sigh] 

511.16 512.49 A: give everyone a a 

517.42 523.00 B: you know i've i've i've seen that a lot um i mean i remember when i was younger i actually uh i had a job at target 

522.71 523.64 A: (( mhm )) 

523.07 527.43 B: and affirmative action was very much in place there um 

525.90 526.64 A: (( mhm )) 

527.83 531.51 B: and i mean it it worked out well because uh 

531.77 533.69 B: you know nothing [sigh] 

534.24 540.80 B: nobody you know none of the candidates really had anything to offer [noise] over any of the others so so there was any 

538.40 540.07 A: exactly 

540.91 543.94 B: there wasn't any performance impact [noise] 

543.12 551.40 A: but you know where we're going we're going back to where skills are still first and foremost [sigh] the criteria you need to hire or use to hire 

547.92 549.04 B: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

551.39 562.32 A: and when uh when you put skills aside if you've got several candidates that all meet that qualification then i think you kinda [sigh] can go and use affirmative action to kind of 

562.52 566.56 A: s- settle the uh you know the tie between candidates at that point 

566.60 571.62 B: right yeah i mean and that's that's a pretty that's a pretty fair 

567.04 568.82 A: but you know well i think 

570.44 573.54 A: [sigh] but you still got to look at skills to get things done 

573.69 579.10 A: in you know in an efficient manner uh [mn] you know you don't want it to be a hindrance to an organization 

579.24 582.01 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

583.17 587.71 A: well [sigh] where are we at on time i'm sure we've got to be close to ten minutes [sigh] 

587.69 590.83 B: [noise] yeah i don't know [laughter] 

590.48 592.20 A: have you ever done this before [lipsmack] 

590.89 594.72 B: i didn't i didn't look at the clock uh this is my second time [noise] 

593.70 599.89 A: okay i s- just signed up for it the other night it's an interesting topic i uh [sigh] it doesn't it it 

596.64 597.78 B: yeah 

598.59 599.95 B: (( yeah well ))
