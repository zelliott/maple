0.00 1.82 A: how're you doing my name is alan 

1.93 3.64 B: hi i'm amy 

3.17 4.66 A: hi amy how are you 

4.78 5.88 B: okay 

5.63 11.24 A: [sigh] okay they said the topic was affirmative action in promotions 

12.26 15.38 B: promotions i thought it was something about the workplace and 

14.29 18.56 A: right okay i guess the affirmative action uh you can start the conversation 

17.99 19.81 B: [laughter] 

18.97 21.44 A: 'cause it's kind of strange for me 

20.95 23.08 B: (( yeah [laughter] um )) 

23.25 27.45 B: i guess i think people should be hired based on their skills and their experience and [sigh] 

27.95 29.19 B: not taking 

29.42 32.55 B: race and whatever else into consideration 

32.58 45.01 A: right that's true see i remember growing up and it had gotten to a period of time [sigh] to where we you know women's lib got big and all this [sigh] and they to hire x amount of women for like say construction jobs [sigh] 

44.84 55.00 A: and then x amount of minorities and a lot of people started to get really upset about that for what reason i don't understand [sigh] you know for me it doesn't make a difference 

55.18 65.25 A: you know if you have somebody who's qualified to do the job [sigh] or is qualified for say the b- the better position [sigh] you know what i'm saying i feel they should be allowed to uh you know do what they gotta do 

57.89 58.95 B: mhm 

65.51 77.78 A: you know i mean they what do they call it it's supposed to equal opportunity for everybody [sigh] you know but [lipsmack] some some sometimes some um private corporations don't look at it like that 

65.84 66.97 B: right 

78.95 89.86 B: yeah and i don't think the corporations would have to should have to worry about that that they have to have a certain number of this nationality a certain number of that nationality a certain amount of women men and [sigh] 

89.94 92.03 B: they should just be able to hire the best one [noise] 

92.24 96.94 A: [lipsmack] exactly should be based on your qualifications and your experience 

97.49 103.29 A: i mean sometimes qualifications it don't mean anything it's more about the experience 

103.31 112.09 A: [sigh] i mean anybody can you know anybody can read a book or go to college but you really need the experience to be able to you know [mn] to be able to do 

112.47 114.44 A: you know whatever your job entails 

115.47 122.01 A: you know but for me like i said i think everybody whoever long as you know [sigh] it should just go to the better man or woman 

121.99 122.98 B: right 

122.03 126.17 A: you know there shouldn't be have to be any status quotes on anything 

126.30 127.37 A: you know 

128.35 130.60 A: (( but )) 

130.77 133.57 A: [sigh] unfortunately sometime it doesn't happen [noise] 

130.89 131.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] right uh-huh )) 

133.97 136.36 A: you know but um 

137.04 144.17 A: [noise] you know it's like it's like with like i mean i'm new york [sigh] and you know you got a lot of people that are like on welfare quote unquote 

143.93 145.05 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

144.34 150.99 A: and you know that's fine and dandy if you need or you're stuck or whatever but you see they have what they call down here the work experience program 

151.18 160.95 A: [sigh] and what that's doing is that's taking a lot of jobs from like the department of parks sanitation this and that [sigh] to where they're working for their little welfare check 

161.03 162.09 B: yeah 

161.09 166.54 A: [sigh] but but meanwhile they're not opening up a test for people to take to get a real job 

166.36 167.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

167.49 170.97 A: like the parks department they haven't given a test in like eight years 

167.57 168.64 B: mhm 

169.93 170.80 B: [noise] 

171.38 179.06 A: same thing with sanitation and or you know it's just [lipsmack] you know and i don't feel i don't feel that that's fair 

178.80 180.33 B: yeah 

179.73 183.23 A: you know what i'm saying everybody should be entitled to try to get you know 

183.48 188.56 A: try to get something you know i mean [sigh] you can't work in macdonalds and support a family 

188.03 189.74 B: (( [noise] yeah that's true [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

189.15 191.05 A: you know that's the bottom line 

191.72 193.11 A: (( you know but )) 

194.42 197.32 A: you know i don't whether we're off the topic or not but you know 

196.76 197.96 B: [laughter] 

197.69 199.81 A: it's just a strange topic 

199.43 204.15 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah i'm not sure exactly what all is included under affirmative action anyway [laughter] [noise] 

203.66 211.85 A: yeah yeah me too i know it c- you know it could have been something different but [sigh] you know i mean i've heard of affirmative action hiring 

211.83 212.91 B: mhm 

212.23 218.78 A: but i'm not i never was really you know to me it never m- it never was important to because you know i work in construction 

215.07 216.16 B: [noise] 

216.73 217.33 B: [noise] 

217.80 218.51 B: (( mhm )) 

219.19 222.14 A: you know it's about the skills and you know what you can do 

222.33 224.46 A: [sigh] and if you can do it the right way 

224.85 232.28 A: [sigh] so you know affirmative action to me sounds like well you have to have and even maybe an even keel or you can bounce the x amount of people 

232.16 233.13 B: [noise] 

232.51 236.01 A: being in various minorities and you know men and women 

236.09 237.18 B: [noise] 

236.85 238.57 A: you know what i'm saying i don't know 

238.64 252.10 B: yeah i think it means sometimes [noise] that they have to they have to have a certain amount of [mn] of a race or maybe it reflects the population with the percentages or something like that but then they can be turning away someone who's more qualified [noise] just to meet their quota 

252.19 253.25 B: [noise] to 

253.46 254.29 B: (( [noise] )) 

253.83 264.58 A: [lipsmack] exactly and that's not you know that's technically not fair but you know apparently that's just how things are some times [sigh] you know you got have x amount of this x amount of that 

256.55 257.30 B: [noise] 

258.06 258.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

264.79 270.08 A: [sigh] but if you look into to the sports industry you know i don't know if that works like that in that industry [sigh] 

270.23 271.33 B: [laughter] 

270.68 272.44 A: you know what i'm saying it's 

271.80 273.00 B: yeah 

272.49 277.18 A: i mean that's a whole different type of ball game [sigh] but um 

277.81 292.31 A: [lipsmack] you know like i said you know for me i i have no problem you know who who i work with [sigh] you know what nationality they are or what race they are or what or what sex they are it doesn't make a bit of difference to me [sigh] as long as they can hold their own weight 

292.22 294.59 A: [sigh] you know that's all that really matters 

295.05 307.18 A: because you know in my type of professional [sigh] you know if quote unquote there is quotas [sigh] and you hire somebody just to make a quota and they don't know what the hell they're doing they can kill somebody or seriously hurt somebody 

305.33 306.34 B: mhm 

307.43 308.84 A: you know but 

310.22 312.06 B: [noise] yeah i heard they [noise] the 

312.17 318.03 B: [sigh] the women have different standards than the men [noise] for fire departments [noise] and military and stuff and then 

315.83 316.93 A: right 

317.90 327.40 A: but you know i've heard that now when you t- talk about office work [sigh] like say your standard like secretary receptionist [sigh] things like that [sigh] 

321.79 322.68 B: mhm 

327.23 335.83 A: that ninety percent of the time supposedly they'll hire a woman over a man [sigh] because women are quote unquote more responsible to show up to work 

336.23 341.25 A: [sigh] and i guess i could kinda believe that you know because um 

339.24 340.07 B: (( hm [noise] )) 

341.28 347.56 A: you know i got friends and it seems like the women show up more to work than some of the men do [sigh] for various reasons 

345.46 346.44 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

348.15 359.18 A: you know but as far as like you know [lipsmack] um you know responsibility wise i think women are more responsible than men when it comes to making it to work [sigh] you know on a daily basis 

359.74 365.42 B: hm [sigh] i would think the women would miss more just because if the kids are sick it's usually the women that stay home 

365.78 373.64 A: [sigh] right but i know but nowadays you never know maybe if there's if you could be situation where the man works nights the woman works days 

366.06 367.53 B: rather than the dads 

373.88 376.59 A: [sigh] you know it could be an even flow that way too 

376.34 377.28 B: yeah 

376.97 384.89 A: so you know that's really hard to say but [lipsmack] i think on an average the women are still more responsible [sigh] but [sigh] 

385.56 388.99 A: you know what do w- you know those type of things are sometimes 

389.02 391.04 A: but um 

391.99 406.56 A: i don't know it's just really it's just affirmative action is just you know a strange type of a thing [sigh] you know there shouldn't be any quotas for this or that [sigh] but i remember growing up through the seven- through like the when i was like oh i'm thinking like mid sixties 

406.61 409.14 A: [sigh] when i was just coming around being like ten eleven 

409.53 414.96 A: and i used to hear people talk well you go down to the sanitation department see my friend mike he'll get you right in 

415.16 420.33 A: [sigh] you know and there was a lot of favors for this favors for that so like you know a lot of outsiders couldn't get in 

415.42 416.27 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

420.17 421.27 B: yeah 

420.63 435.58 A: that's probably when they started all this thing with you know you gotta give tests you gotta hire x amount of this people x amount of that type of people [sigh] you know that's most likely probably where that came from [sigh] because i know for a fact if you like like i tell you even down in the city here [sigh] 

435.51 441.68 A: all your upper level like people who work for department of parks [sigh] most of them are all old time white people 

442.21 444.84 A: you know you don't see a lot of minorities in it 

444.90 446.05 B: (( mhm )) 

445.35 454.04 A: until recently i guess like when they gave the test about five or seven years ago or ten years ago [sigh] when they had a big hiring now it's more diverse 

455.03 455.98 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

455.99 461.08 B: [noise] i think i think something they try to make especially diverse is like teachers at elementary schools 

461.38 462.63 A: (( yes school )) 

461.57 464.88 B: they want they want all the kids to be able to see someone that looks like them 

464.75 467.79 A: yeah same thing with the police and the fire departments 

467.37 469.18 B: and then you get teachers who [sigh] 

469.44 473.05 B: can't even speak proper english and they're trying to teach english [laughter] 

472.42 474.75 A: yeah i know and that's that's horrible 

475.05 477.85 A: (( that's horrible [mn] you know but )) 

479.54 486.58 A: [mn] you know it's just i don't know you also gotta remember that so many ethnic ra- groups and races in schools now 

486.38 487.66 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

487.06 491.52 A: that it's just you know i mean we have we've got a big diverse you know 

491.64 494.13 A: [sigh] diverse ethnicity 

494.41 501.42 A: [sigh] it's not like it was you know in the old days when i went to school there was like just it was basically [sigh] everybody had to speak english 

501.41 502.34 B: uh-huh 

501.95 510.75 A: now i mean there's like a friend of mine she speaks like three different languages she's haitian she's speaks french [sigh] she speaks english and she speaks something else 

510.75 518.94 A: [sigh] but she has trouble getting a job because her english isn't as g- her english is good but you really got to listen to her speak 

518.70 519.92 B: mhm 

519.29 525.73 A: you know and that's you know that's just you know unfortunate but you know she's she's got her skills 

526.91 528.52 A: (( [sigh] but [sigh] )) 

527.04 528.15 B: yeah 

529.14 532.24 A: i don't know yeah but i believe the school system should be diverse 

532.41 539.53 A: you know that's that's that i agree with that same thing with the police departments they should be more you know they should be the way they are 

539.23 540.46 B: yeah 

540.21 545.09 A: [sigh] you know this way you got all types of cultures nobody can say anything about anything 

545.08 548.60 B: yeah say that it's a [sigh] racist arrest or whatever 

548.37 551.46 A: [lipsmack] yeah yes without a doubt 

550.70 551.95 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

554.83 555.67 A: (( but )) 

557.03 558.05 A: (( [lipsmack] i don't know it )) 

557.31 558.35 B: [laughter] 

558.36 562.58 A: [sigh] i guess affirmative action is more of a big thing than maybe i realize it is 

563.58 564.64 A: (( you know )) 

565.94 567.15 A: but um 

568.24 571.00 A: [lipsmack] oh this robot was pretty cool on the phone 

571.78 573.17 A: (( but i don't know )) 

572.65 573.88 B: [laughter] 

574.02 577.03 A: i don't know i don't know what else to say about this topic 

577.55 579.83 B: yeah i don't know i worked in in daycares [sigh] 

580.23 585.29 B: till i had my daughter and it seems like they just pretty much hired anyone who could breathe so [laughter] 

584.74 588.09 A: you know and that's a shame too because you know you're working with children 

587.89 589.16 B: mhm 

588.49 599.95 A: [sigh] you know what i'm saying i mean [sigh] i know in the i know in the i know in state or in the city where i live and i have to get a job as a you know uh in the evening a red negro called up a registered daycare [sigh] but they do
