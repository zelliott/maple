120.28 121.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

123.53 135.48 A: ah intelligent people people that ah good i._q.s and good ah earlier academic credentials they don't prefer to go to ah public schools 

135.19 136.06 B: yes 

135.64 138.09 A: i don't know that's what my thinking is 

138.89 141.77 B: you say that they don't go to public schools 

140.97 143.96 A: yeah they don't like to yeah yeah 

142.46 148.23 B: yeah [noise] and i think some people that are like that that are in public schools aren't challenged enough

156.19 157.78 B: let's see [sigh] 

158.33 163.50 B: hm [laughter] i think i'm like i know the school that i went to 

163.66 164.62 A: mhm 

163.83 165.89 B: like high school and stuff like that 

165.94 169.44 B: they had um honors classes 

169.86 174.97 B: where you could take like an upper like you could you'd be taking the same class 

169.87 170.84 A: okay 

175.29 177.58 B: but it would be more accelerated 

178.02 179.06 A: (( okay okay )) 

178.85 180.38 B: like um 

180.47 181.88 B: you would take 

182.05 186.66 B: algebra or something like that but you would take 

187.01 190.15 B: like an i._p. algebra or honors algebra 

190.60 192.20 B: where you would be 

192.36 197.99 B: you would skip like some i know in some classes that we took we never made it all the way through the book 

198.29 199.13 B: (( you know )) 

199.13 200.00 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

199.56 205.15 B: and then like the honors classes they would either have another book that would um 

205.84 207.61 B: you would start out like 

207.65 210.78 B: say it would be like in the middle of the book 

210.84 215.61 B: or you know that some like comparison to where the other classes would start 

212.11 213.05 A: mhm 

215.85 222.28 A: okay so you skip the basic material or the material that you think is not hard enough for the level 

218.49 220.48 B: yeah 

222.51 225.13 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

223.35 224.32 A: okay 

224.43 230.84 A: yeah that's a good way to improve the ah academic i don't know the syllabus the curriculum 

231.27 232.15 B: mhm 

231.40 232.47 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

232.98 238.33 B: you'll have to excuse me i have a cold [laughter] a lot of sniffling and [laughter]

246.77 248.06 A: (( [laughter] )) 

248.21 260.16 A: yeah so what else about public schools i don't know i think public schools maybe people who don't have enough money to spend on a good private schools they opt for public schools 

259.86 263.39 B: (( yeah and i'm sorry go ahead )) 

260.70 261.65 A: do you think 

263.46 265.35 A: (( yeah so what do you think about )) 

264.81 274.65 B: [laughter] well yeah and the money issue also it's the same in the public schools um a lot of public schools are not funded enough 

274.67 277.37 B: to have higher education 

277.33 278.84 A: (( that [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

277.73 281.04 B: to have more accelerated learning um 

281.31 282.88 B: better teachers i 

282.94 287.25 B: mean i know like private schools some of them have you know 

288.13 292.97 B: teachers that have you know masters degrees and such 

293.24 294.17 B: (( [noise] um )) 

294.45 300.62 B: and the classes that they're teaching [laughter] you know as far as public schools you know um

322.13 323.29 A: yeah 

325.14 327.13 B: um people with more 

326.89 327.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

327.60 328.28 B: um 

328.85 330.29 B: that are more 

330.05 343.11 A: better professors type higher paid ah teachers and all that stuff yeah yeah yeah that's true i mean if they are charging more for their students they are obviously in a better position to pay 

331.07 337.47 B: yeah yeah yeah [laughter] there's another word i was looking for but yeah [laughter] 

343.18 348.23 A: higher ah to their teachers and attract ah better and ah 

346.29 348.01 B: (( yeah )) 

348.27 353.54 A: more ah i don't know published teachers or something like that [noise] 

351.42 352.86 B: (( yeah )) 

352.93 359.01 B: [noise] you know it's like in cincinnati right now um a lot of schools have become charter schools 

359.27 367.16 B: which they're still public schools but they're charter schools where if you're in cincinnati you can choose to go to any public school 

359.55 360.48 A: okay 

362.18 363.09 A: mhm 

368.05 369.09 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

368.59 372.63 B: and i know they have they're starting that in um the dayton area too 

372.84 379.84 B: you know and if there's there's there's schools that are getting more students are getting more money 

379.88 385.03 B: from the government to get better teachers [laughter] so you know they 

380.12 381.89 A: mhm 

383.15 391.46 A: oh yeah that that's true i know many public schools have ah which are state funded ah they have this policy that ah 

391.54 396.66 A: every student they admit the state's going to pay ah an equal amount of 

397.12 397.84 B: yes 

397.14 405.65 A: ah to the state as much as the student pays to the school yeah yeah oh yeah but i don't know how much how that ah 

400.36 401.12 B: yes 

403.18 403.97 B: hm 

405.94 411.91 A: (( improves their ah standing as to as to the academics is concerned )) 

411.83 412.95 B: i th- i 

412.22 415.26 A: i know most of the public schools are making losses 

415.65 416.38 B: (( d- yes )) 

417.40 419.25 B: and l- like i mea- i'm 

419.71 426.01 B: in that sense because some of the schools like and some of them are losing out 

426.77 428.10 A: (( some of them are what )) 

427.82 439.41 B: they're losing out on funding on students on you know popularity because it's almost becoming like charter schools are almost becoming like private schools 

435.82 436.72 A: uh-huh 

439.52 442.97 B: because they're getting more funding and you know 

439.72 440.68 A: uh-huh 

443.01 449.73 B: you know the the students do not have to pay to go there but the government is paying for that student to go there 

446.68 447.69 A: yeah 

449.51 462.45 A: yeah yeah most students who go to public schools provide a lot of scholarships and ah like then it makes sense also public schools are supposed to be their their motive is to provide ah 

454.04 454.97 B: yeah 

462.23 469.27 A: good education to everyone so that everyone who doesn't have money ah to spend on education they can 

467.15 468.86 B: (( yeah )) 

469.34 479.67 A: ah they can go to a public school and at least get some education there i don't think that necessarily their aim their mission they're motivated to um have a very 

479.69 485.37 A: high quality education but i think their mission is education for all maybe 

481.31 482.45 B: right 

485.01 487.19 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

486.33 490.09 A: so that everyone can have access to education which 

489.29 491.94 B: yeah and i i and some of 

492.18 501.14 B: i don't know the way i look at some of the schools like i've been here in cincinnati for three years and my fiancee i went to visit his old high school 

501.95 506.33 B: and i walked in that place and i was appalled by what i saw 

506.98 509.83 B: the buildings run down 

510.15 513.52 B: just um it seemed like there was more students 

514.34 517.12 B: like the student to teacher ratio 

517.46 519.06 B: was very high 

517.62 518.68 A: mhm 

519.10 525.18 B: like the there was a lot of students and very little teachers very little supervision 

523.40 524.59 A: mhm 

525.24 526.40 A: mhm 

525.80 537.07 B: um i don't think that now in in the high school that he went to is now broken up into what there's three high schools three different um there's like an international school 

537.11 542.00 B: and um then just like their general and then there was another like 

537.20 538.12 A: uh-huh 

542.41 546.79 B: i don't know if it's an honors or i i'm really not sure how they explain the other one 

547.36 555.37 B: but um it just seemed that the the buildings were run down the materials 

555.48 559.63 B: i mean i went to you know graduated from high school in ninety seven [noise] 

559.97 562.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh yeah [noise] )) 

560.15 567.89 B: and i think back at what we used in class and i look at what they're using now and it's like two thousand and three 

567.87 569.84 A: mhm and besides 

568.42 570.94 B: and you'd think that it would be better 

570.96 571.97 A: yeah 

571.09 573.05 B: but it looked worse 

573.15 576.46 B: and i mean it might be either different different cities 

573.25 574.34 A: and besides 

576.52 579.26 B: but it's still you know [laughter] 

578.37 587.59 A: yeah exactly and besides ah different public schools in different states they have different standards ah like recently in my m._b._a. course ah 

584.15 585.07 B: yeah 

587.58 599.89 A: i had ah ah i don't know what to the exact title was but he was a very senior person in the ohio education board and he had all the data about ah 

596.87 597.92 B: uh-huh
