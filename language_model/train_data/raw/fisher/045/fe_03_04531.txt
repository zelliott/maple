12.15 13.07 B: good 

13.98 20.34 A: i'm riding back to my workplace from deep south georgia so that's uh 

20.71 25.05 A: down here where the watermelons and the strawberries and the peanuts grow [laughter] 

23.95 27.44 B: yeah i love georgia i've been there quite often i come down 

26.60 35.40 A: ah it's a wonderful place and everything in the south georgia's coming into bloom the the the corn is just about shoulder high i'm a short person so 

35.47 37.96 A: it got warmer in a hurry here 

37.53 38.88 B: yeah huh 

38.88 44.98 A: and looks like we've got roadblocks okay but i can talk affirmative action is the subject correct 

44.35 45.76 B: mhm 

45.10 49.10 A: and we're supposed to talk about whether or not we think it's a good idea 

49.44 54.77 A: [lipsmack] okay who want's to go first you can i can or we can go back and forth you want me to go first 

52.08 54.47 B: oh you can yes 

54.58 55.73 B: yes 

55.23 67.41 A: all right i really believe it is still a good idea i know that that's controversial and a lot of folks believe that the the time and the need for that has passed 

67.24 75.21 A: uh personally i don't um i think that businesses need to um 

69.22 70.40 B: (( mm )) 

76.61 80.54 A: [sigh] be specially mindful that that uh 

80.94 90.21 A: even in today's time we haven't come into uh full equality on on in in the workplace for either women or minorities 

89.25 91.47 B: i agree with that one hundred percent 

90.79 99.36 A: i thought we're going to have nothing to talk about [laughter] the problem i think there is is that when it's treated as if it is a 

92.72 94.63 B: [laughter] 

99.42 108.65 A: um a quota or when people um [lipsmack] i don't know how to say this just really do not um 

109.30 120.38 A: they give it tokenism okay i i have been in the workforce many years now and i was um i guess you would say the first uh can you hear me 

111.19 112.24 B: mhm 

119.91 121.39 B: yes ma'am mhm mm 

120.59 126.25 A: okay i i'm going in and out of a signal or something but i was i guess the first white female professional 

126.41 127.57 A: um 

127.89 133.48 A: in basically an all white male l- location and um 

131.45 132.45 B: (( mhm mm )) 

133.75 137.54 A: i didn't even get invited to management team which 

137.58 146.64 A: you know after i'd been in them i shouldn't you know i would flipping grateful i didn't have that wasted time for three hours every monday [laughter] but uh 

146.75 153.50 A: truly um i didn't even raise this as an issue 'cause i was straight out of graduate school but anyway back to the subject i 

153.47 163.92 A: i can i can relate to this this topic um as as one that that if if you're not even fully included once you're hired that's also an issue that's also a problem 

162.77 164.66 B: yes uh-huh yes 

164.16 165.72 A: um 

166.19 175.26 A: how do you feel like the recent turn of events in terms of uh the judge speaking out and saying that we no longer need affirmative action has an impact on this however 

174.97 185.82 B: no well i think he was wrong i think we still need it 'cause um a lot of especially in the in here in the inner city uh a lot of uh disadvantaged uh children and uh 

185.74 193.17 B: well i would say college students cannot even get into school they would need that um affirmative action programme mm 

187.57 188.85 A: mhm 

192.42 195.81 A: n- uh-huh uh-huh when you think affirmative action 

195.82 198.58 A: to use which groups does that speak to 

198.49 202.99 B: well basically i would say that speak to the afro american group 

202.43 203.57 A: uh-huh 

204.06 205.04 A: uh-huh 

205.63 218.96 B: 'cause um right after the uh civil rights laws was passed and everything and we start getting an influx of um different people from all over the world i think the afro american was pushed more to the back 

215.18 216.22 A: yes 

219.21 223.69 A: yeah in terms of of percentages probably at this point yeah uh-huh 

221.73 222.62 B: yes 

223.95 229.51 A: yeah it could well be i don't really know my statistics that well but i would imagine that um 

226.00 226.58 B: (( mm )) 

230.25 237.63 A: in terms of if anything is if anything you're you're per- percentage for afro american is lower now than ever before 

237.18 238.44 B: yes ma'am 

238.28 243.94 A: and then you know of course the other issue is is and and you know i don't know maybe 

244.30 250.70 A: i think there may be even time to reframe [sigh] as it were affirmative action 

250.25 251.32 B: mhm 

250.71 254.44 A: to speak to some other issues in addition to 

254.63 258.22 A: afro american maybe an issue speaking to 

258.24 270.78 A: um hispanic population speaking to asian population you know it's a question of does it does it i'm a sociologist so does it does it sit as it is or is there 

270.82 273.53 A: a ref- a refinement of it uh per se 

273.68 277.74 A: um that's that's where i think it would probably hit a really big fight 

277.27 278.41 B: mhm 

277.58 285.05 A: as it were when not you know once we get beyond that first uh layer do we still need it or not 

284.86 292.87 A: i i think the business community in the large part i guess it's it depends which business community you you're dealing with you know 

291.94 293.77 B: yeah exactly yes 

293.17 294.60 A: um 

294.91 296.13 A: er 

296.19 301.97 A: and that gets tougher i mean i'm i'm i work w- in the government and you know it's certainly 

302.30 312.15 A: from the positions i work in and all where i i work with state government uh there's not a doubt that you know that it's here that we you know that we are full compliance with it 

304.40 305.34 B: mhm 

311.01 314.39 B: yeah i'm working with the city government it's 

313.46 314.64 A: uh-huh 

314.98 315.81 B: (( mm )) 

315.85 318.41 A: um can i ask you which city or are we allowed 

317.81 320.66 B: oh i'm in um new york city 

320.09 325.19 A: new york city uh-huh and how does the city uh respond to its 

320.74 321.56 B: yes 

325.51 326.84 A: mandates 

326.85 328.41 A: requirements i should say 

329.00 330.40 B: (( well it )) 

330.61 333.56 B: we don't have that um 

334.23 339.64 B: affirm ho- you know i'm an instructor and i have a tape on and it's just finished right now 

337.94 338.82 A: uh-huh 

339.44 340.38 A: uh-oh 

339.69 343.11 B: could could you wait two minutes okay ma'am 

341.06 342.16 A: sure 

375.76 378.90 B: [noise] [noise] uh hello ma'am oh okay 

376.44 378.27 A: [noise] yeah 

378.98 382.45 B: uh i had to give them another i teach the defensive driving 

381.87 383.00 A: okay 

382.58 384.21 B: mhm 

384.34 386.60 B: uh for taxi cab drivers 

386.17 395.85 A: oh my gosh now that's a fun job [laughter] i jus- i just took a defensive driving for myself to lower my rates so it's a good class 

389.65 390.66 B: well 

393.75 395.10 B: yes that's 

395.60 396.98 B: yes yes 

397.11 407.21 B: um well uh my c- the class that i'm teaching most of the people that are here are majo- majorities from um other parts of the country pakistan and from the east from asia 

403.82 405.09 A: yes 

406.45 407.33 A: (( yes )) 

407.49 408.62 A: yes 

408.56 417.22 A: and i think in fact culturally you drive a lot differently every day i just came back from south east asia about two months ago and 

416.47 417.63 B: mhm 

417.02 425.60 A: you just get out there and you go [laughter] 'course that'd be good for new york yes [laughter] [laughter] 

418.72 419.94 B: [laughter] 

422.22 423.85 B: oh no well 

424.51 430.48 B: i try to make them slow down 'cause we have there's a lot uh more cars here in new york than up across the country 

428.90 439.35 A: yes yes yes i yeah now getting off topic a bit but that's i um i am not you but i i i think that it's going to you know um 

439.58 441.99 A: [lipsmack] i know there's a lot of feeling 

442.07 455.95 A: not necessarily it's a southern feeling i think there's a lot of feeling everywhere that our work is done and in one sense on affirmative action getting it's uh like okay well at least we're cognizant maybe a little more um 

446.80 447.75 B: mhm 

456.12 462.78 A: but it's it's like anything else once you assume it's all taken care of it to me there can be little residuals of it i know 

462.84 476.46 A: the go word of the seventies and and eighties perhaps more the eighties and nineties for women was you know the sexual discrimination and there was an assumption that that's all over that's taken care of and and truly it's not you know so it's 

475.52 476.41 B: no 

476.50 489.23 A: it's um it's difficult i know people want to move on to other subjects you know that it's not the hot topic anymore the the n- hot topic as it were is security and so forth you know 

481.30 482.25 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

489.48 494.39 A: and i think people get weary and that's the hardest thing is you know [lipsmack] 

490.74 491.82 B: mhm 

495.08 499.84 A: i'm a i'm a writer by my uh not my profession but my interest 

497.94 500.07 B: [noise] 

500.25 506.05 A: so um i think i think we c- we need to come up with some language not necessarily to 

506.14 507.58 A: make it um 

507.73 510.92 A: less important but to make it more 

510.96 516.43 A: publicly under heard again you know it's like anything else it can get a bit um 

513.58 515.29 B: (( mhm mm )) 

516.58 519.28 A: it gets old for people so they quit listening 

519.64 530.54 A: so something like equality in the workplace or you know even beyond that no another word equality's not even the word that i'm looking for but access you know opportunity something 

528.80 529.63 B: (( yeah )) 

530.39 535.46 A: uh priority in the workplace something that gets at it but it's it's a 

535.52 541.64 A: i think we have a um a you know we're sort of hitting the grind on the economics everywhere 

539.61 540.55 B: mhm 

541.83 543.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

543.81 545.19 B: (( [noise] )) 

546.25 548.21 B: mhm yes ma'am
