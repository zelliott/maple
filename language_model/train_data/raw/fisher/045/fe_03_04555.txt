0.40 2.30 B: uh hi my name's chris all 

2.37 3.89 A: h._i. i'm scott 

3.92 5.31 B: right 

5.81 6.66 A: [laughter] 

6.15 8.73 B: so uh [sigh] affirmative action 

8.46 10.52 A: affirmative action uh 

10.30 12.29 B: what do you think about it [laughter] 

12.22 13.38 A: [laughter] 

13.67 18.11 A: uh i think it's got it's it had it's i think it's served its purpose already 

17.84 19.18 B: yeah 

18.77 21.72 A: i think it's a little out of date and i think it needs to be changed 

22.17 29.57 B: yes uh well me uh i'm not sure by your voice what ethnicity you are but i'm a white male 

29.18 30.50 A: (( yes i am too )) 

29.59 41.37 B: uh [cough] and uh i just think that affirmative action is definitely hurting me i mean [laughter] in in pretty much all way pos- all ways possible because 

41.48 47.53 B: it does nothing for me in fact it helps other people to rise above where i would be so 

47.67 50.71 B: of course i don't really agree with it 

50.58 51.70 A: yeah [noise] 

52.78 53.71 B: um 

54.37 56.33 B: but i think that uh 

57.00 66.20 B: there's problems you know with it and there's problems without it and i don't know it's i don't think it's a very good system either way 

66.90 73.79 A: [lipsmack] yeah i think it kind of l- like boosted minorities to get into into college and jobs and stuff 

72.08 73.03 B: yeah 

73.40 74.60 B: yeah 

74.04 78.18 A: back when it was needed but i don't think they need that need it that much any more 

78.03 80.62 B: yeah yeah i mean 

80.76 81.32 B: (( [cough] )) 

81.85 85.26 B: i just think that everything should be fair i mean it shouldn't be 

85.38 97.03 B: what like whenever you you have a job and you know you have a coworker who's black or you know i don't know whatever other ethnicity 

96.44 97.92 A: mhm 

97.64 104.24 B: it should just mean they shouldn't go by what you look like or what your background is they should go by how you work i mean 

104.66 116.81 B: i just don't think that it's it's i think it's like reverse discrimination in a way i mean i i can see why they instated it at first but now it it's just it doesn't make sense to me 

116.66 118.77 A: [noise] yeah definitely 

119.01 120.42 B: (( definitely )) 

122.02 122.98 B: (( but [lipsmack] )) 

125.95 127.53 B: (( um )) 

129.05 130.36 B: and uh 

131.96 133.62 B: it's bad for us [laughter] 

136.53 141.72 B: but i mean for college applications it's different i guess i mean 

143.18 157.73 B: i don't know i don't know if if many colleges actually use it like i think they do i think some colleges try to accept a certain number of black kids and a certain number of asian kids and a certain number of indian kids but i don't know i mean 

151.06 153.80 A: (( yeah )) 

157.64 160.96 A: [noise] [laughter] i don't know i'd like to i'd like to find out if they do 

158.02 159.34 B: i'm not really sure 

160.75 162.01 B: yeah 

161.61 164.31 A: [sigh] 'cause it just doesn't seem right 

163.39 171.29 B: i mean i know i think i just read something in the news that either virginia or virginia tech is uh 

171.66 174.65 B: is reinstating that policy 

174.73 176.61 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

175.01 184.46 B: like they hadn't they hadn't before i mean like over the past few years but they're now going to begin accepting a certain number of black kids and um 

178.72 179.28 A: (( [sigh] )) 

184.93 187.55 B: i don't know i just think that's going in the wrong direction 

187.29 193.54 A: i could have sworn that president like [mn] the first bush i though 

193.46 194.24 B: yeah 

193.62 197.64 A: got rid of that like made it illegal i thought [noise] 

195.35 196.73 B: oh yeah 

197.57 211.41 B: oh really yeah i'm not really sure i i've never i haven't really looked up many of the politics on affirmative action i just know that it doesn't it doesn't suit me at all in fact it hurts me so therefore i don't really enjoy it and its uh 

208.94 209.92 A: (( mm )) 

211.50 213.47 B: institution as a whole 

213.36 214.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

213.68 214.76 B: but uh 

216.92 217.99 B: [sigh] i don't know 

218.39 218.95 B: (( [cough] )) 

219.40 223.82 B: but like i go to college in atlanta and uh 

223.94 226.99 B: there's quite a few minorities in our college so 

226.59 229.35 A: (( yeah it's not like they're not getting into college any longer [noise] )) 

229.29 231.31 B: yeah exactly i 

231.39 232.64 B: (( mean [sigh] )) 

233.25 237.97 B: i just think like i j- i just think it should be blind to what your 

237.98 238.92 B: uh 

239.97 250.80 B: i mean it if a kid comes out of high school with you know a low s._a._t. school and poor grades but he's of a different ethnicity and you as like a white person 

250.67 262.76 B: come out of high school with a high s._a._t. score and decent grades and you are you are denied simply because you're white and he is he's uh accepted into the college simply because 

262.55 266.73 B: he is of another ethnicity i just think that's completely wrong like 

265.64 270.11 A: it's it's reverse of what we wanted it to be for 

267.70 268.99 B: exactly 

269.78 284.07 B: exactly it should be it should be exactly the opposite it should be you are they're blind to they shouldn't ask you what ethnicity you are on the application they should just say what's the s._a._t.s what's the grade you know like what are the activities that they're involved in 

276.59 277.89 A: (( right [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

284.17 288.42 B: and and in that way then then it's the truly fair way 

289.31 291.05 B: but 

291.28 302.61 B: i mean maybe i don't know maybe i'm j- i just have a view of it since i'm a you know a white male and you know affirmative action does nothing but hurt me but i mean that's the way i see it i mean 

303.53 310.87 A: like i try to look at it from like minority perspective perspective and [sigh] i really don't see like how 

303.54 304.46 B: (( i don't know )) 

306.65 308.28 B: right right 

311.21 313.32 A: [mn] how they can think it's fair either 

313.00 320.06 B: yeah no i yeah like if you look at it from their perspect- i mean personally i don't like to be given things i mean i 

320.82 329.70 B: i don't like my values are that i would like to work for things and i don't i don't like to feel like somebody gave me something because of because i'm i was a charity case 

329.48 341.24 B: and in that way if i was a minority i wouldn't want affirmative action either i'd say you know what we're going to do this on our own like we're not going to take your charity you know if if we have the good grades then we're going to get in to the good schools and you know 

334.96 337.22 A: exactly 

342.03 348.06 B: like i just think it kind of demeans them them as the race to say okay well you guys need a little bit of help 

347.97 357.77 B: and we're obviously dominating you so therefore we're just going to give you a little push in the right direction i mean i i'd be offended by that and 

357.93 359.74 B: but that's what 

358.47 360.01 A: (( yeah i mean i'm a )) 

360.38 365.58 A: i'm a high school senior you know so i'm going to graduate in two in like a month 

365.13 367.49 B: i yeah so you're l- you're l- you're 

366.16 371.38 A: and i know what it took to get there i know what it took for me to get accepted to college 

368.83 369.74 B: yeah 

370.96 372.81 B: yeah exactly 

371.61 382.20 A: i don't want someone who does less work than me far less work that [mn] [sigh] far less work than me doesn't care to get into the same like to take my spot 

376.45 377.31 B: right 

381.92 386.44 B: yeah exactly like someone who goes to [mn] a like an inner city school 

386.31 400.22 B: who doesn't who doesn't like hardly ever go to school but you know somehow they apply to a school with a decent grade as you like [mn] around the same you may have better than them and they get into a school that you don't i mean 

399.77 401.60 A: mhm 

400.57 410.60 B: that's just i don't i don't agree with it and i don't think that's really helping our society i think it's telling them like hey look you know we're sorry we you know 

410.66 416.79 B: we're going to offer you reparations for slavery and things like this and so now you're going to get a free ride even though 

413.80 414.71 A: (( [sigh] yeah [laughter] )) 

417.02 417.99 B: you know 

418.17 425.70 B: i j- i just think like you know we're all equal let's just treat everyone as though they're equal and things will work out better 

423.39 425.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] exactly )) 

426.52 427.66 B: but hey [sigh] 

428.66 429.55 B: (( you know )) 

430.05 433.51 B: i i guess i should try to read about the uh 

433.66 437.55 B: the current state of affairs in the politics i don't even know 

437.78 445.67 B: where it's at right now [sigh] i think most schools don't use it but i'm sure some do i mean it has to if it's still a topic of discussion 

443.31 445.18 A: yeah 

446.21 449.42 B: i mean in the workplace i think it's absolute bullshit 

450.15 451.14 B: but hey 

451.40 454.25 B: (( am i allowed to swear on this thing i guess i just did oh well )) 

455.32 457.18 B: (( but [cough] )) 

459.70 460.60 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

463.12 464.87 B: where are you headed to college 

464.84 467.49 A: um [lipsmack] a school in new jersey 

467.64 468.47 B: (( nice )) 

469.71 470.78 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

471.02 473.86 A: it's n- it's n- it's not big it's not small 

471.15 471.96 B: but 

473.71 478.90 B: yeah do you know anything about their application process like if they uh 

479.47 485.64 A: they had some um ethnic questions but they were all optional 

479.55 480.51 B: i mean 

483.58 484.66 B: yeah 

485.47 486.73 B: yeah 

486.58 495.07 A: and there w- there was one like for the the housing but that was just so that like they just want to make you comfortable in your dorm 

489.81 491.10 B: oh right 

493.96 495.74 B: right right 

495.96 502.94 B: 'cause like when i was applying to georgia tech i mean they we had some questions about it but i usually don't answer them just 'cause 

496.09 497.88 A: yeah 

503.13 508.17 B: i don't like whether i mean it's not going to help me either way to to say i'm like a white man 

506.43 508.56 A: yeah i i don't answer them either 

508.18 519.19 B: and it it can only hurt me to to answer that so i just don't answer them but i i think that i think if it's optional then how could they i mean like if 

520.59 526.96 B: if they were going to base some sort of application on a s- on a little check box that they put on the application i mean 

526.81 540.28 B: you could say you could write like oops i'm i put that i was black and say oops i made one mistake like one little check box i mean they can't i don't see how they could base a whole application off one little check box that people can you know 

535.20 536.06 A: [laughter] 

538.04 539.79 A: yeah definitely 

540.58 551.40 B: accidentally write the wrong one or something like that but i mean maybe the schools where it's uh mandatory or where they actually y- do use uh 

551.99 556.34 B: this uh [sigh] type of uh acceptance maybe 

556.42 561.95 B: it when they ask you that question it's just not optional like you must write something down i don't know 

562.68 563.45 B: but 

564.82 570.94 A: [sigh] i could see how maybe like maybe in like in the south during the the fifties and sixties how 

568.67 569.76 B: yeah 

570.87 572.30 B: oh yeah i know 

571.24 576.78 A: it you know it probably helped a lot of minorities to get into school where they weren't going to get in 

575.55 577.59 B: definitely definitely 

577.62 580.33 A: but now things are a little bit more equal 

580.06 584.37 B: yeah and like i mean 

584.79 587.13 B: i just think that you know there's 

587.63 599.89 B: [cough] whenever i mean whenever a school gets an application from a minority they think oh okay this is good we you know like we need more mi- more minorities in our school so you know if they have the
