12.13 20.45 B: yeah the lady i talked to l- ah last night ah lived in southern california oh pairing us up with people that live fairly close i guess [laughter] 

16.48 17.56 A: oh really 

19.41 21.63 A: similar yeah that's interesting 

21.12 23.97 B: so what do you think about the public schools [laughter] 

23.21 24.71 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

24.77 28.92 A: well i guess my first my first ah 

29.67 35.21 A: thing that kind of comes to mind is um i guess i i think that there's probably a lot of 

35.72 44.32 A: cultural issues that are affecting the public schools and ah the fact that there's really not very much money being 

44.83 48.91 A: ah directed to the public schools probably not as much as as there needs to be 

46.50 47.36 B: (( right )) 

49.22 50.76 B: yeah 

49.46 50.41 A: um 

51.58 52.49 B: (( um )) 

51.60 55.00 A: that's that's my idea about it my in- my initial ideas about it 

54.55 58.69 B: yeah it's been a while since i've had kids in the school system so 

58.70 60.08 A: oh really 

58.81 73.68 B: um ah well i teach music and so i you know i have contact with a lot of kids that are still in school of course but um my kids are grown and [laughter] and have have gone through the school system here and i thought at the time 

62.46 63.44 A: oh you do 

65.79 66.69 A: wow 

67.95 69.06 A: yeah 

71.29 72.48 A: yeah 

73.86 76.59 B: the school system i think at that time was better 

76.99 78.09 A: (( uh-huh )) 

77.31 84.09 B: than it is now well i know it's deteriorated somewhat as far as the like you said the cultural 

78.52 79.77 A: yeah 

84.53 86.50 B: cultural issues of course there 

86.57 95.35 B: they've eliminated a lot of the cultural things from the schools the music programs and everything is just non existent anymore like they used to be 

92.09 93.44 A: (( uh-huh )) 

94.24 95.57 A: yeah 

95.62 96.72 B: and ah 

96.54 102.95 A: well i guess i'm thinking in terms of you know the fact that both parents are working now and you know that sort of thing 

100.62 101.82 B: right 

103.16 105.04 B: yeah i'm and um 

105.19 110.46 A: a lot of responsibility is being really being put on the shoulders of the teachers where you know 

109.05 110.30 B: right 

111.01 114.63 B: a lot of schools now are forced to have the after school 

114.80 120.15 B: programs you know for the kids that don't have any place to go until their parents pick them up you know 

117.00 117.95 A: yeah 

118.42 119.65 A: right 

119.80 120.95 A: right 

120.33 126.44 B: they have all kinds of activities going on and i know some of my students are involved in a lot of those daycare type 

126.38 127.75 A: mhm 

127.08 129.32 B: situations after school 

129.26 130.41 A: yeah 

130.75 131.78 A: yeah i was 

130.78 132.83 B: (( i mean i i think too )) 

133.09 137.23 B: one of the problems too is that a lot of times they put too much homework 

137.85 141.91 B: on the kids i know from ah just being a music teacher that ah 

140.46 142.65 A: (( hm )) 

142.26 151.37 B: um some of my kids f- anywhere from about the fifth or sixth grade up have three or four hours every night 

150.92 152.18 A: really 

151.68 159.59 B: of homework and therefore i it's really difficult for them to find time to practise an instrument or anything you know and i think well that's 

152.86 153.88 A: wow 

156.77 157.93 A: yeah 

159.91 163.64 B: i know maybe to keep up with the technology and everything they have to 

163.58 164.51 A: yeah 

163.78 168.52 B: really push kids but i think you know where when do kids have time to pursue 

168.84 176.45 B: other activities you know or just be a kid and want to sit around and do nothing you know and [laughter] relax or 

170.85 171.78 A: right 

173.54 177.14 A: right [laughter] uh-huh 

176.89 180.30 B: you know or read a book or something that they don't have to you know 

179.66 180.84 A: yeah 

180.60 184.82 B: that's like when i went to school there was a lot of time to just read or 

184.96 191.64 B: or practise an instrument or belong to scouts or do a you know those type of things 

187.48 189.45 A: yeah i don't remember 

191.35 197.89 A: yeah i don't remember having to do that any more than maybe an hour average of homework every night 

195.69 201.12 B: right oh the kids nowadays are loaded up i mean i have kids that stay up until 

201.48 208.09 B: you know al- past midnight getting their homework done and ah you think that's not good for them physically either 

203.46 204.56 A: wow 

204.68 205.67 A: wow 

207.87 209.13 A: yeah 

208.89 210.52 B: (( but ah )) 

210.30 213.64 A: huh i wonder w- i wonder why mm 

212.74 214.01 B: i don't know 

216.47 228.67 B: i don't know i guess each teacher feels that their subject is most important or something [laughter] and they don't take into consideration that all of the different teachers are piling on the homework 

222.43 223.75 A: (( [lipsmack] wow mhm )) 

228.45 229.58 A: yeah 

229.50 230.41 B: but 

230.63 233.12 B: then there's so much to learn though and [sigh] 

230.74 231.66 A: maybe 

233.36 239.10 B: a lot more there's a lot more to learn now than there was when i went to school too [laughter] 

233.49 234.68 A: right 

235.72 236.89 A: (( right )) 

236.99 240.19 A: right that's true the age of information right we've got 

239.42 241.32 B: yeah all this information 

240.25 246.55 A: so much of it out there they've got to drill as much as they can into the students' heads right 

245.55 246.56 B: right 

246.86 250.75 B: i think academically a lot of times they're way ahead you know 

250.99 257.20 B: than what they used to be but i think that ah a lot of the stuff that they're being taught is not 

251.61 254.35 A: hm 

257.72 259.34 B: the greatest either 

257.80 260.23 A: (( hm no no theory uh-huh )) 

260.24 265.50 B: and i i think that a lot of things are prejudiced as far as 

265.76 268.00 B: the views that they present 

268.02 269.16 A: mhm 

268.09 269.72 B: of history and 

269.45 270.52 A: yeah 

270.11 273.00 B: and science and things like that you know 

272.23 273.29 A: yeah 

275.37 275.93 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

276.03 285.79 A: yeah i guess i'm i've been ah i graduated high school in nineteen eighty nine so i've been out of out of that school you know that part of school i mean i went to 

280.41 281.54 B: mhm 

285.84 290.41 A: i guess ah state college after that to u._c. santa barbara 

287.68 288.53 B: uh-huh 

290.16 291.32 B: (( oh uh-huh )) 

291.22 292.71 A: and um 

292.92 295.95 A: [lipsmack] i really you know i wanted to go a u._c. school 

296.08 297.15 A: um 

297.36 300.20 A: because it was it was good but i've h- you know i've heard that it's 

300.40 303.98 A: not quite as good as it used to be whatever ten or twenty years ago 

302.55 303.57 B: yeah 

305.14 306.54 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

307.60 310.55 A: although i'm sure some schools are better than others ah 

310.03 318.40 B: yeah well i just recently ah was ah high you well a couple of years ago played ah was hired as a pianist for 

318.54 326.13 B: one of the middle schools in this area for their choir and their band orchestra and everything and um 

320.10 321.26 A: (( mm )) 

326.21 327.60 B: so i had some 

327.77 339.41 B: you know connections with the teachers there and i i found out that you know we they always are saying there's not enough money for this or enough money for that but these teachers get requisitions 

329.98 331.20 A: mhm 

336.68 337.75 A: yeah 

338.88 341.25 A: (( hm )) 

339.82 352.78 B: for supplies for their room you know for their classrooms every year and i hear- you know and i would hear these teachers saying well what can we spend it on this year so because if we don't spend it all then we'll get less next year 

341.84 342.80 A: yeah 

343.64 344.71 A: yeah 

352.61 354.25 A: oh wow 

353.58 360.91 B: you know and they're just looking around for things that they can spend it on and that's i think that's kind of a strange way of doing it they should just 

357.15 358.15 A: huh 

360.11 361.41 A: (( uh-huh )) 

361.32 370.50 B: have to put in a requisition if they need something and then the funds would be allotted to them but for them they each get you know a certain amount of our taxpayers' money 

366.65 367.81 A: right 

370.28 371.41 A: right 

370.64 375.02 B: to spend in some way and then have to look for ways to spend it [laughter] 

372.35 373.24 A: huh 

374.28 375.49 A: yeah 

375.77 376.68 B: (( you know )) 

376.29 379.10 A: (( hm )) 

377.79 383.30 B: i i think that that's kind of something that maybe needs to be changed in the system you know 

383.01 387.74 A: uh-huh so that they have have more decision making at the top about what it's going to be spent on 

387.80 394.91 B: right or ah the ah there's just the procedures of you know not just allotting everybody so much money 

393.47 394.62 A: right 

394.99 400.98 B: to spend you know it's like giving them an allowance and then if they don't spend it then the next year they get less 

395.99 397.03 A: right 

397.68 398.82 A: yeah 

400.57 401.87 A: right 

401.38 412.71 B: they figure they don't need as much but you know the needs change from time to time especially in the music department because one year you may not need any instruments the next year you may need to replace some you know 

406.84 407.75 A: right 

409.99 411.07 A: right 

411.83 413.75 A: right totally 

413.17 415.11 B: and 

414.33 415.92 A: so you're teaching now 

415.83 417.10 B: ah yes uh-huh 

417.60 418.98 A: at for ah 

417.87 423.56 B: not in not in a public school i teach in i teach in out of my home and also in a private music school 

420.82 421.86 A: oh 

423.21 424.34 A: oh wow 

424.43 425.58 A: that's neat 

426.48 427.16 B: (( mm )) 

426.51 428.94 A: yeah i used to play piano and 

428.47 429.15 B: oh 

429.96 433.35 A: ah french horn and trumpet [laughter] 

432.24 433.15 B: uh-huh 

434.04 435.05 A: um 

434.08 438.93 B: well i i teach mostly piano and then i do a lot of accompanying and performing 

438.95 440.46 B: but um 

440.44 454.28 B: you know that's i i still have contact with the kids in the schools and i know what they're going through and some of their classes and stuff so [laughter] but ah i don't have as close a contact as i did of course when my kids were in school but ah 

444.75 445.76 A: yeah 

446.13 447.14 A: yeah 

448.59 449.60 A: wow 

453.22 454.32 A: uh-huh 

454.75 461.09 A: [lipsmack] so if you were to if you had if your kids were school age now would you consider sending them to a private school 

461.13 463.34 B: if i could afford it i think i would 

462.90 463.87 A: yeah 

464.67 469.03 B: (( i probably would because because of the ah i mean there's just ah )) 

469.87 473.78 B: well i don't know there's so many restrictions on what the teachers can teach ah 

473.40 474.55 A: (( uh-huh )) 

474.45 475.57 B: as far as 

475.60 480.98 B: you know i think that the judao christian beliefs and everything are completely 

481.23 484.69 B: ignored or you know it's forbidden to 

484.07 485.21 A: uh-huh 

484.74 492.03 B: to even mention and i think that they should be mentioned along with other beliefs you know i mean that people should be able to ah 

486.42 487.56 A: right 

488.77 490.27 A: right 

492.54 493.39 B: (( you know )) 

493.48 497.09 B: i know some of the schools even had an issue over christmas 

497.28 501.98 B: songs or something they couldn't sing christmas carols or anything you know at christmas time well 

497.36 498.43 A: yeah 

499.81 501.10 A: yeah 

502.14 512.20 B: i think that's a little bit ridiculous you know [laughter] and you know our country was founded on those beliefs and those systems and yet we can't you know people are 

503.78 505.19 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

512.24 514.04 B: criti- are um 

514.45 521.37 B: not able to use you know to to write a a report or something on like a bible character 

521.45 522.36 A: yeah 

521.74 524.56 B: or or something like that you know um 

522.75 523.85 A: really 

525.11 529.26 B: which the s- used to be taught at least as literature you know 

529.05 530.27 A: yeah 

529.98 531.32 B: and ah 

531.69 534.94 B: so i think there's a lot of prejudices against 

533.10 533.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

535.42 540.66 B: ah those kind of issues in the schools which are i'd like to see changed 

537.60 539.19 A: yeah 

539.27 544.59 A: i suppose the country's you know e- more diverse than it ever has been you know 

543.67 544.92 B: right 

544.75 546.81 A: so maybe it's ah 

547.04 548.39 A: sort of a negative 

548.97 551.08 A: ah effect of that you know 

550.46 554.46 B: yeah well you know i mean they can they can teach ah 

555.24 562.72 B: all the other beliefs and everything but [laughter] [laughter] w- which is really s- you know 

557.16 558.47 A: yeah 

563.20 566.07 B: i mean it's part of the culture you know a lot of 

565.23 572.33 A: yeah they they should be able to figure out a way for students to celebrate whatever tradition they've grown up with you know 

571.01 572.98 B: right mhm 

573.02 578.71 B: well i remember when we were in school we had christmas you know we we also had different kinds of ah 

573.14 574.07 A: yeah 

575.94 576.92 A: oh yeah 

579.00 586.73 B: celebrations you know i mean if they're for other country we learned about how other people celebrated different holidays and everything and 

584.57 585.77 A: mhm 

586.79 587.97 B: in their country 

586.92 588.36 A: where did you grow up 

588.38 590.31 B: (( i grew up in southern california )) 

589.90 590.89 A: oh okay 

590.81 592.86 B: it's just back in the fifties and sixties 

592.74 593.90 A: yeah 

593.17 596.78 B: [laughter] [laughter] it was a lot different though then 

595.89 597.34 A: yeah yeah yeah 

597.10 599.89 B: a lot different and
