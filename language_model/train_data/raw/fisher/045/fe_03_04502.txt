3.58 5.01 A: my name is jennifer 

4.75 6.10 B: hey jennifer 

6.71 11.55 B: well what do you think do you think there is anything wrong with the public school system 

12.89 15.69 A: tough big wide question there [laughter] 

13.03 13.96 B: [laughter] 

15.39 16.98 B: yeah 

17.21 19.90 A: well i know in my area um 

20.64 24.67 A: i think that the the class sizes are way too big that they're 

24.38 25.48 B: oh yeah 

24.86 26.28 A: you're not getting the 

26.82 27.90 A: the direct 

28.80 32.70 A: one not necessarily one on one but not able to ask 

33.03 36.81 A: you know as many questions because they have such short time schedules and everything so 

36.88 39.32 B: (( ah where are you at i'm in )) 

38.54 40.79 A: ah i'm in deluce minnesota 

40.66 44.87 B: deluce oh okay i'm over in provo utah 

41.26 42.33 A: mhm 

44.57 45.51 A: okay 

46.47 48.63 A: how w- how is the school system there 

48.76 49.80 B: (( ah )) 

49.90 54.53 B: well i have two kids one's in high school one's in middle school and um 

55.80 63.97 B: one thing that hasn't been working too good is they're pretty they have a pretty strict attendance policy where um 

64.17 71.58 B: i mean if they miss a certain number of days it really messes them up i don't know how it is back there at deluce 

70.50 78.44 A: yeah they they recently probably the last um ten years they started that where if you miss so many days per semester or quarter 

78.66 79.64 A: um 

80.25 84.20 A: you to repeat or you know like get a severe discipline for that i mean even if 

84.37 88.18 A: even if it's like surgery or some kind of illness you know it's 

88.66 91.20 A: i mean it's like two or three days in in the same 

88.71 89.56 B: (( ah )) 

91.23 93.24 A: semester and you're in trouble so 

93.08 95.88 B: yeah well um 

96.37 105.55 B: they have one school district here where um there is no attendance policy they just have to score well on their tests and um 

106.23 112.69 B: and that's what my son preferred but unfortunately we live in the other district where 

112.05 113.52 A: oh [laughter] 

112.91 114.59 B: yeah so 

114.87 117.13 B: anyway but that's been 

117.79 121.98 B: something ah hi- his comments were that he wished um 

122.11 125.30 B: he could just be graded on what he knows 

125.36 130.73 B: and pass the test and not be graded so much on um 

131.04 132.17 A: on showing up 

131.85 135.34 B: such an external thing as sitting in a classroom 

134.72 136.01 A: yeah 

135.67 137.27 B: so much time 

138.59 144.55 B: and all but that's just one possibility of how to change schools 

143.20 144.96 A: [noise] 

144.70 149.52 B: ah d- did you go to school i mean [laughter] 

147.61 148.45 A: (( yeah i )) 

148.98 150.51 A: went to public school yeah 

150.25 154.22 B: you did yeah ah so what year did you finish your schooling 

153.60 155.54 A: ah ninety four actually 

154.84 160.24 B: oh ninety four okay yeah i got out of high school in seventy four 

155.78 156.83 A: mhm 

159.85 160.75 A: okay 

160.52 162.31 B: yeah 

161.92 168.22 A: um even where i went to school there was still nothing like ah and i was out for almost a month with a 

168.23 170.20 A: appendicitis and 

170.90 176.26 A: you know i wasn't on one of my classes i was docked because actually just one of my 

176.86 178.95 A: classes ended up 

179.93 182.03 A: (( having more attendance )) 

182.26 185.70 A: and it was a psychology class i had to be actually be there 

185.75 186.70 B: oh 

185.76 193.76 A: there was more um over fifty percent of the grade was attendance so i didn't do so well that semester but i didn't have to repeat anything so 

193.71 200.48 B: yeah thank goodness you didn't have to repeat anything gee that would be crummy getting appendicitis 

195.99 197.11 A: yeah 

201.49 203.76 B: i hear a kid in the background is that yours 

203.41 206.61 A: yeah i've a seven month old daughter here so 

203.91 204.70 B: (( oh )) 

206.50 209.36 B: oh so she's still too young for school huh 

208.80 212.66 A: yeah but i i'm already kind of keeping eye out to 

212.81 214.61 A: you know what what would be best 

214.91 217.22 A: um schooling for her to get a 

217.27 219.67 A: another school district i mean here it's 

220.17 223.63 A: we started out with three ah high schools 

223.82 235.90 A: along with middle school and elementary schools all separate and i grew up in one school where a kindergarten twelve went so i was used to a class size of you know sixty five seventy people maximum 

235.80 237.67 B: that would be so neat 

237.05 238.02 A: (( yeah )) 

237.71 239.37 B: k. through twelve 

239.46 241.87 B: that's like an old fashioned school 

241.29 242.86 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

242.63 248.13 B: man i wonder if it was better when everybody did this old fashioned school thing 

247.56 249.29 A: yeah i mean it was ah 

249.61 257.97 A: [mn] they still have an all in one building and they're still but they changed a lot of their um class hours and they have less 

258.38 260.01 A: class options 

260.07 261.79 A: right now they do 

262.04 268.23 A: i don't know if they're using my old school like a guinea pig school or what for different ideas of schooling but they're 

268.36 275.69 A: they've started like doing the home room thing what she didn't never used to do they did it like my last year in in high school but um 

276.10 280.44 A: now they're doing it you know more along with extending 

280.79 291.67 A: classroom time which basically means that you can't take as many classes so electives like ah band and choir and like art class and stuff are pushed aside 

291.58 292.65 B: yeah 

291.66 296.42 A: because you need to get your english and math and science and stuff out of the way so unfortunately 

296.51 298.97 A: it has a lot more strong 

299.23 307.17 A: focus on those which is not bad but you know well rounded they come out just you knowing the book studies and they don't they're not they're not 

300.99 302.04 B: yeah 

308.33 309.21 B: (( so did )) 

308.35 311.33 A: good in the their music or art or you know 

311.61 312.69 B: when you were 

311.82 313.30 A: (( they're just doing the basics )) 

312.99 321.93 B: oh when you were still in school did they still have the band and everything at that time but it's just recently they they did kind of did away with it right 

316.68 317.56 A: mhm 

321.30 325.67 A: yeah i mean they they still have it but basically people are 

325.81 328.85 A: um sacrificing other 

328.87 332.73 A: ah classes to be able to be be a part of band and choir 

332.39 334.10 B: oh yeah yeah 

332.74 336.28 A: so it's a lot smaller group i mean when i was in choir there was 

337.14 339.68 A: probably close to seventy people in the choir 

339.72 342.81 A: and now there's like twenty probably left [laughter] 

341.08 342.46 B: (( oh man )) 

342.59 344.23 B: that's changed a lot 

342.87 345.91 A: yeah we used to win competitions and everything you know i 

346.43 347.54 A: mean it it 

347.75 354.67 A: ah it was as very good thing for me to be in because i'd rather be in band and choir and they had to it was same the hour 

354.67 355.61 B: yeah 

355.01 360.61 A: of the day but then they split it you know depending on the day of the week you were either in band or choir or half and half you know 

360.66 364.56 A: and that worked out fine but i don't know why they're just cutting everything down 

365.36 368.78 B: oh i don't know how they could change that because i mean 

369.07 376.12 B: it's kind of a problem because the kids still don't get all that neat well roundedness that they used to have but um 

376.30 379.62 B: i mean they still got a take all their 

379.89 382.24 B: needed classes and stuff 

381.79 382.91 A: yeah 

382.32 385.88 B: i don't know may- maybe it's not even that important to take those 

385.99 388.43 B: required classes [laughter] 

387.68 388.93 A: (( i know the the )) 

389.26 393.89 A: i mean you know i i loved taking the the science courses and everything but i mean it's 

394.35 397.41 A: my english is even after high school so 

397.29 398.24 B: yeah 

397.51 399.09 A: it's not really 

399.13 403.13 A: i mean i- you know i know it's important to know your basics and stuff but 

403.83 405.72 B: yeah 

404.90 413.14 A: and some of those classes have you take how many years in math and everything and you know i i i've never used geometry in my life [laughter] so 

411.63 412.74 B: oh yeah 

413.31 416.18 A: i mean depends on what what career you're going in but then 

416.34 418.05 A: why not leave it for college 

417.86 418.77 B: yeah 

418.14 421.44 A: you know take take those kind of courses in college then 

422.57 423.76 A: (( but [sigh] )) 

423.40 434.89 B: you know what when when i first connected on the phone with you you told me your name and this isn't this is my first call so i was kind of all hyped up and i spaced your name what's that 

426.61 427.54 A: mhm 

434.02 435.92 A: that's okay ah jennifer 

435.53 437.87 B: jennifer okay and my name's art 

437.50 438.30 A: okay 

438.35 443.40 B: okay jennifer from deluce minnesota oh that's cool 

440.45 441.59 A: (( yeah )) 

443.52 445.53 B: um well my 

445.63 459.25 B: i don't know i i have some friends that home school their kids and just love it and ah there's this one kid that he didn't even go to he didn't even finish high school he just took his um 

460.04 462.25 B: i think he took is g._e._d. 

462.06 462.93 A: okay 

462.29 472.37 B: and then just did ah college i mean when i was in school they'd always say well you're employer's going to look at your diploma and they're always going to ask 

472.35 479.46 B: just and look to see if you graduated but in all the years since i've graduated i can hardly remember a time when 

479.56 483.46 B: they even checked to see if if i was a graduate 

481.30 482.32 A: [laughter] 

483.54 484.83 A: yeah 

484.52 489.13 B: so the kids you know they tell them it's so very important but i don't know if ah 

489.26 492.22 B: if people really care once they get out in the 

492.48 493.92 B: world because then you 

493.09 497.48 A: not as long as you're able to do the job that they're supposed to be doing there i don't yeah it's 

497.58 499.01 B: yeah because i'm 

499.53 501.06 B: yeah i mean 

503.16 509.81 B: [sigh] i know lots of people that went on to advanced degrees and then they still don't even use it they just do something else anyway 

508.94 510.65 A: yeah [laughter] 

509.91 512.02 B: it seems weird doesn't it 

511.53 513.41 A: like my husband's a um an 

513.83 520.92 A: example he's got a bachelors degree in in ah christian education and he works for a collections company so 

520.73 521.98 B: wow 

521.20 532.61 A: [laughter] you know he's trying to get back in there but you know a lot of times when you're you're going to school for something too then by the time you're out those jobs are not on the market anymore it's something different so 

533.79 534.65 A: (( [cough] )) 

535.30 543.45 B: yeah well i can think of lots of things that could possibly be wrong maybe the teachers aren't paid enough or there are not enough teachers or something like that 

542.15 548.05 A: yeah i think there's a yeah i think there's a lot more of like administrative stuff administrative people 

548.22 549.05 A: that 

548.28 550.17 B: yeah 

549.20 552.65 A: yeah they could probably cut out a few middle people and 

553.15 554.11 A: um 

554.13 558.45 A: well have assistants to a systems and if there's [sigh] 

559.27 560.97 A: i don't know i think if they 

561.11 571.04 A: were to have like smaller schools they wouldn't have such a people and have to worry about doing so much for them rather than the teachers and i think the people actually teaching the kids 

571.57 576.46 B: and i think when you're interacting with so many different ages all at once 

572.34 572.93 A: (( [cough] )) 

576.45 579.66 B: it kind of makes the kids be more balanced in a way 

579.26 580.16 A: mhm 

579.56 592.48 B: because they have to be careful not to step on or squash the littlest one in their p._e. and then they also have to be careful not to offend the big ones that could punch them out if they [laughter] if they don't like them 

583.34 584.25 A: yeah 

591.22 592.33 A: yeah 

592.75 599.89 B: so i mean it it kind of forces a person to get along with ah a bigger cross section of
