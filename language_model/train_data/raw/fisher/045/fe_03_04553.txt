0.01 1.67 A: [sigh] this is chris 

1.24 6.01 B: (( [noise] hi chris this is gail and i have to i'm fine i hope you are )) 

3.20 4.73 A: [sigh] hi gail how are you 

5.67 7.81 A: yes yes very much so 

6.50 10.28 B: [noise] i apologize my dogs are going off because somebody's walking down the street so 

9.82 11.33 A: oh okay 

10.76 13.07 B: pardon me but we'll get through this [sigh] [sigh] 

12.49 13.77 A: (( that's okay )) 

14.09 15.10 A: um 

15.68 17.48 B: okay affirmative action 

16.67 19.45 A: [lipsmack] [noise] affirmative action [cough] 

17.88 18.90 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

20.12 26.74 A: [lipsmack] personally it it it's always been something that i've been against [sigh] um [sigh] 

26.75 29.45 A: only because i i um i don't 

29.99 41.43 A: [sigh] i i mean i i guess personally i i'm not a part i wouldn't be considered part of a minority [cough] but i think that if i were [sigh] i think affirmative action would [sigh] 

41.90 48.56 A: lessen the challenge for you if if you're being given something upon numbers alone 

48.18 49.21 B: right 

48.78 51.41 A: [lipsmack] you know i mean personally i think it's um [sigh] 

52.06 55.78 B: you have to prove yourself versus your color race gender and all that junk 

55.67 64.66 A: correct correct you know and i think if someone's handing it to you like that it may they may be doing you more harm than good to a certain extent you know 

56.24 58.44 B: uh-huh yep uh-huh 

62.06 63.24 B: mhm 

65.34 73.19 B: but [sigh] how do you feel about like males and females doing the exact same job side by side and one makes more than the other and 

66.58 67.28 A: (( [sigh] )) 

73.48 75.92 A: [cough] [sigh] oh i'm not for that whatsoever 

75.46 76.61 B: (( excuse me okay [laughter] )) 

76.55 82.81 A: i i don't think it's you know [sigh] i mean i i mean i would hope that it should be something dependant upon experience 

82.23 83.08 B: right 

82.84 83.81 A: (( you know )) 

83.58 84.84 B: (( yes and if )) 

84.07 92.89 A: [sigh] [sigh] and and i've never come across that personally but i i have heard practices like that but [sigh] but i guess you know i haven't worked in payroll but [sigh] it was always 

93.02 99.10 B: well you know i i had a a corporate job for fourteen years and i was [mn] neck and neck with a lot of 

100.16 106.45 B: uh males females i don't know what i saw more than the gender thing was um 

105.49 106.33 A: (( [cough] [lipsmack] [sigh] [cough] [sigh] )) 

106.82 110.12 B: those with families and i and i'm not i i'm single 

110.03 111.21 A: mhm 

110.46 119.87 B: but there there seemed to something skewed along those lines and i didn't know what their paycheck was [sigh] but i knew they had better cars and houses than me [laughter] and so you can kind of figure 

117.50 118.40 A: really 

119.75 122.23 A: because they had families you're saying 

121.94 128.30 B: mm well there there seemed to be a common thread about maybe their reviews were based on the fact that they had more mouths to feed than i did 

128.42 129.57 A: (( ah )) 

128.45 130.75 B: i don't i d- i never knew one or the other 

131.07 137.29 B: in a yeah and like the only think i had to go on was that they had a b._m._w. and i had a chrysler or whatever you know what i mean 

131.67 133.21 A: (( [noise] [sigh] right )) 

136.50 138.63 A: mhm [lipsmack] right right 

137.72 140.24 B: and they lived in such and such and i didn't 

140.02 140.58 A: (( [sigh] )) 

140.74 153.03 A: [cough] well i mean i think that's something like that there's even there there's two sides to the coin i mean [sigh] someone who i think people think that someone who is single they don't have a lot of responsibilities so you may think okay well [cough] 

141.12 141.89 B: and so 

152.82 157.81 A: maybe they won't be here maybe they won't put in the effort because they don't have to 'cause they're only feeding themselves 

157.11 157.83 B: (( mhm mm )) 

158.19 169.71 A: [sigh] but on the other hand [sigh] if you're single you're availability is probability is probably much more greater than if you have a family you don't have to leave work because you son you know is sick at school or what have you you know [sigh] 

163.75 164.89 B: exactly 

168.48 179.87 B: right johnny doesn't have a play tomorrow yeah we we used to tease about that and then i said used to i'm going to pretend my dog's sick and call in [laughter] [laughter] mhm mhm mhm 

170.99 171.85 A: right 

172.05 172.68 A: (( [cough] [lipsmack] )) 

174.20 175.10 A: uh-huh 

176.79 179.28 A: there you go there you go 

179.64 183.02 A: [sigh] but but i think af- affirmative action to me is uh [sigh] 

183.10 186.01 A: i you know i do think that 

186.71 187.34 A: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

187.81 189.83 A: playing the other side of the coin 

189.87 193.67 A: i think affirmative action may be put into play because 

193.79 198.75 A: a lot of people say that you need to know someone [sigh] to get a good job [sigh] 

199.18 201.89 A: and i think that maybe because 

202.19 214.16 A: [sigh] maybe the corporate world or the working world [sigh] maybe and i and i'm saying this off the cuff i don't know this for sure but [sigh] it maybe it it it's more so composed of whites than it would be [sigh] 

214.23 217.22 A: [cough] african americans or latinos or what have you 

217.51 229.30 A: [sigh] i i could see where they were they coming in- would come into play with something like that but i mean you know to look at someone's credentials i i don't see where the [sigh] where the problem would be hiring someone or what have you you know 

230.09 231.18 A: (( [sigh] [cough] )) 

231.73 233.04 A: (( but [sigh] )) 

234.79 236.76 B: where are you located chris 

236.75 238.30 A: uh los angeles 

237.72 239.35 B: are you okay okay 

239.67 242.09 B: okay um i'm on the other coast yeah 

241.36 242.10 A: mhm 

242.60 244.36 A: (( [cough] [lipsmack] [cough] on the east cost )) 

243.78 245.90 B: yes i am uh-huh i'm in north carolina 

245.49 247.03 A: oh okay okay 

248.52 249.29 B: (( yeah yeah so )) 

248.52 249.78 A: [sigh] but 

249.64 254.75 B: in general you see affirma- affirmative action as a not necessary step 

256.77 262.18 A: [sigh] i [sigh] i don't know it it it to me it just sounds like such a [sigh] 

263.44 267.42 A: a i want to be careful and maybe not say handout but it it's it's [sigh] 

267.60 272.72 A: something that could be comparable to those lines if something like that were to be abused you know 

271.37 277.07 B: right or you can blame it on i i didn't get it because i'm a girl or i'm a black or i'm an asian or uh-huh 

276.47 278.73 A: mhm yeah 

278.08 278.79 B: (( yeah )) 

278.76 280.68 A: [sigh] and and and i think that 

280.91 283.15 A: [cough] i think you could use something like that as [sigh] [mn] 

283.23 293.14 A: as a scapegoat mentality [sigh] you know which i don't think is right either but i mean i think basically it it it's the credentials of [sigh] you know whomever is i [sigh] 

285.39 286.18 B: (( yeah right )) 

293.20 298.24 A: you know i know jesse jackson spends a lot of money with his rainbow coalition 

296.41 297.19 B: (( [laughter] )) 

297.78 298.96 B: (( [laughter] [noise] yeah well he's )) 

298.34 306.96 A: going to these fortune five hundred companies and saying [sigh] you don't have this percentage of african americans in your [sigh] company something has to change [sigh] 

306.92 313.58 A: and it's like [sigh] you know [sigh] i mean he he's been all over the n._f._l. because of the lack of black head coaches [sigh] 

313.64 321.90 A: and it's [sigh] i i you know i just i don't think that you should put pressure on someone because of that you know it's just [sigh] 

319.48 320.52 B: exactly 

321.34 325.31 B: well he's another story [laughter] [sigh] he's another phone call 

322.79 323.91 A: oh yeah 

324.55 328.87 A: i yeah well i wonder what he does [sigh] you know i wonder how he makes his money you know 

327.96 330.19 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] yes [laughter] mm )) 

329.14 336.54 A: i don't know what he does for a living you know it it it seems like he [sigh] he badgers a lot of these i mean from what i've heard he he can 

336.44 348.87 A: content to badger some of these organizations and say look we need [sigh] your percentages to to go up because you know and i don't even know if he's concerned with anyone else [cough] other than african americans as far as minorities are concerned 

348.30 349.85 B: right [sigh] and it 

349.01 358.01 A: like is he [sigh] is he also i mean and if he is then i think that's plausible if he's [sigh] you know also going after [sigh] you know latinos 

357.28 360.39 B: anything that's inequitable yeah exactly 

358.93 360.83 A: yeah you know 

360.59 367.25 B: it's along the lines of this university of michigan standards or whatever that's in the news or was in the last few months you know 

363.14 364.01 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

367.57 371.84 B: [sigh] whereby they ma- they make the quotas for this many blacks and this many blondes 

371.96 372.87 A: uh-huh 

372.53 382.10 B: mm now gpa and all that i don't know i i tend to be color blind [mn] you know i want to be and [mn] whether you're chiniquois or heather uh 

376.95 378.40 A: (( right [cough] )) 

381.48 382.41 A: uh-huh 

382.49 385.54 B: or bob or tyrone 

385.21 386.32 A: right 

385.76 387.35 B: that's what your g._p._a. 

387.29 388.60 A: exactly 

387.99 393.27 B: but there's a whole lot of emphasis on this many uh on numbers very fine numbers 

391.66 392.73 A: yeah 

393.05 406.89 A: [sigh] well in p- and the whole thing with that is that you have all of these [sigh] these sports players you you've college athletes may pr- primarily football and baseball [cough] or football and basketball rather [sigh] that are getting into these colleges with absolutely no grades whatsoever 

401.07 401.86 B: right 

406.42 407.29 B: right 

406.66 410.82 A: but only because they're so good at their sport that they're bringing more equity in for the school 

410.21 410.97 B: uh-huh 

410.91 413.32 A: [sigh] you know and now they want to get paid for it 

412.70 413.52 B: (( mhm mm )) 

413.57 419.00 A: so i mean it's it's like [cough] i don't know it's it's just a whole round robin thing there [sigh] 

418.68 422.07 B: yeah it is yeah yeah you've pegged it perfectly [sigh] no 

422.21 423.45 A: (( yes [sigh] [sigh] )) 

423.62 426.19 A: but i affirmative action has been 

427.21 437.58 A: [mn] [sigh] i i mean i i [sigh] see i'm not too familiar with like the laws that have been passed on something like that [lipsmack] or if jesse's actions trying to [sigh] or whomever is is trying to 

437.99 446.57 A: [sigh] incorporate some law to congress federal law to congress about you know hiring you know about having your quotas and so forth [sigh] you know 

444.83 446.12 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

447.04 448.05 A: [sigh] i mean 

448.45 457.83 A: [cough] primarily i i work in the entertainment industry i work in hollywood and it's it's very [sigh] um age specific [sigh] 

453.15 453.71 B: (( [mn] )) 

457.65 460.65 B: well there's another little issue [laughter] 

459.01 463.13 A: m- yeah more more so than anything else very age specific 

461.37 463.81 B: okay yeah uh-huh mm 

463.35 464.34 A: (( you know ))

469.47 470.28 B: right 

470.97 476.46 B: you can get in trouble there too i mean the laws are created for to protect all that stuff 

472.70 474.26 A: oh absolutely 

475.89 476.72 A: (( [cough] )) 

476.99 481.08 B: good better indifferent i don't know somehow i feel like it's a safety net 

480.95 481.94 A: mhm 

481.30 482.98 B: somehow but then 

483.53 491.85 B: there's a whole lot of lawyers' pockets getting padded over you know he said i was too blonde or too short or too tall or too white or too something 

486.73 488.52 A: mhm 

492.03 493.07 A: right

497.65 500.62 A: yeah [sigh] [cough] that's that's pretty much the gist of it i mean 

501.34 507.57 A: [sigh] personally i just see like uh a lot of people out here that [sigh] you know th- they have their [cough] 

507.54 521.38 A: they have their specific jobs and [sigh] some of those jobs are because of who they know and i mean primarily i see that you know i've i've seen i used to live on the east coast and you know i see that all over the place it just [sigh] it seems so much any more that [sigh] 

521.19 523.49 A: that's what it's dependant upon who you know 

523.08 524.25 B: (( mhm oh )) 

523.57 525.25 A: and it's you know [sigh] 

526.34 529.93 A: good in some ways but [sigh] you know not so good in others [sigh]

531.01 532.20 A: yeah 

533.47 534.45 A: right 

533.48 538.05 B: because if for those of us who got trained or educated or
