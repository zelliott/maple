62.17 65.37 A: half the time they have to stop me to ask me 

65.65 67.08 A: what i meant 

67.14 71.16 B: maybe you could just talk a little softer for me we've got a really strong connection here 

71.30 72.77 A: oh i'm sorry 

72.30 73.54 B: that's that's okay 

73.58 77.82 B: so you they they can't even understand when you're when you're talking to them sometimes

100.33 101.21 B: yeah i 

102.21 108.32 A: but the seventeen year old and the nineteen year old should not have to ask 

108.16 111.42 B: no they're almost adults they should understand what you're saying pretty much 

111.29 114.41 A: exactly and like when you'll use words like 

114.50 117.07 A: enclave um 

117.12 119.12 A: nomenclature 

119.47 121.83 A: they don't know any of this and

125.28 127.92 A: oh no it's it's everything um 

128.04 132.68 A: they kind of teach math well they don't teach 

132.94 141.22 A: social studies worth crap um history they don't learn the problem is either the teachers don't care 

140.93 141.74 B: uh-huh 

141.71 145.74 A: or like okay in catholic school 

145.77 150.94 A: which is what i went to i went to a private catholic school um if you didn't want to do your homework 

151.22 160.30 A: tough titty pretty much like [laughter] you had to do it and you had to do it right and you had to care they made you care 

159.45 160.47 B: (( exactly )) 

160.14 166.71 A: well in public school if you don't care the teachers are not there to make you care 

166.25 171.82 B: well let let me ask you this the area where they go to school is it like a rough neighborhood is it like a big ci- 

171.22 172.09 A: (( um )) 

172.13 180.78 A: not really i mean granted yeah if you look at a store like k. mart and you see tons of gold lexuses 

180.71 181.68 B: right 

180.93 185.16 A: you you're watching a drug deal going go down 

185.88 194.46 A: um it's it's but it's not like so dangerous that you can't walk in the dark from our house to the movies which is like four miles away 

194.12 196.25 B: right right 

195.53 199.47 A: like if i wanted to walk home at eleven o'clock at night i'd feel completely safe 

200.69 204.54 B: geeze that's e- so you think it's just the teachers don't care 

204.54 206.47 A: well yeah 

206.68 209.50 A: and the teachers that i've talked to don't care 

210.22 211.38 A: it's like 

212.19 215.90 A: they can't care because when they start caring 

216.18 223.01 A: they come up with more and more rules in the school that takes them and distances them from the students 

222.44 229.03 B: so so it's a matter it's more a matter of money which would be the same thing here they just don't put enough money into the education 

228.44 236.04 A: yeah they don't make enough at all which is ridiculous because education should be one of our finest priorities 

235.58 236.89 B: right 

236.62 243.23 A: because i mean these are our children and supposedly our quote unquote future 

244.16 252.21 A: that they're messing around with and if you don't pay your future enough well what do you expect to get in the long run 

252.34 262.25 B: right that's like that's like me we have three kids and i what i do is i've been i've i went to school for two years and now i'm just doing all sorts of things so that i'm working a lot from home 

262.27 263.29 B: so that i don't 

262.28 264.79 A: can you talk just a little bit louder 

264.45 269.93 B: oh sure i can i'm just i'm i'm trying to work from home a little bit so i can be with my kids more often 

265.54 266.61 A: (( oh thanks )) 

270.01 275.18 B: so that i don't have to get daycare and stuff like that you know and so that they can learn from me instead of other people 

272.05 273.78 A: mhm 

275.69 284.38 A: well you see i had an excellent education in grammar school too which gives me a little bit of an advantage over the normal 

285.23 291.20 A: kid because i mean our school if you were in first grade you learned second grade material 

290.93 292.66 B: right 

292.04 295.14 A: and that's why my mother 

295.30 301.08 A: that's why my mother put me in that school is to give me that because louisiana schools 

301.24 303.49 A: (( ordinarily are )) 

303.56 305.78 A: some of the worst in the nation 

305.65 306.96 B: really 

306.77 316.65 A: yes they are um because the teachers aren't paid enough the t- the teacher salary in louisiana is some of the worst 

317.10 319.06 A: in the entire nation 

319.15 328.26 A: um the teachers aren't paid enough they have all these rules now where it's like it's hard for them to get involved with the actual children because like 

328.54 336.14 A: it used to be if a teacher gave you a hug at the end of a day it was because you did a good job and she was you know she was 

336.28 337.33 A: giving you 

337.61 343.78 A: kudos but now if you get a hug from a teacher it's sexual harrassment and she's trying to rape you 

338.54 339.56 B: right right [laughter] 

343.40 347.02 B: no shit [laughter] there's a lawyer in every box 

346.77 358.47 A: you know exactly and it's like the t- i mean you know they blame the teachers for distancing themselves from students but how can you blame them when they're getting every time 

358.26 371.38 B: yeah exactly it's it's like i see on the internet not too long ago where a kid ah a little girl slammed her brother's hand in the door and ah the father spanked her in the parking lot and it went he went to court he was you know they want to take the kid away and everything 

371.10 373.48 A: i yeah that's i mean [mn] 

371.94 372.78 B: (( that's like )) 

372.89 381.03 B: you know she tried to slam her brother's hand in the door just missed i mean he could have had broken fingers i mean it was a legitimate spanking [laughter] you know what i mean 

381.21 386.54 B: you got to it's the same with teachers you got to let them do things and there's got to be a 

383.10 390.16 A: mhm well yeah people i mean people 

390.38 403.28 A: are afraid to discipline their children lately i've seen people try to intervene in a mother child you know disciplinary action and then they wonder why children today are monsters and they are 

392.90 394.00 B: (( oh i know )) 

403.15 409.27 B: well it it's true i remember like my my child my childhood wasn't that hard but i i was disciplined 

409.37 417.21 B: i mean my kids my my parents didn't beat me but i mean kids now they just know they know they can get away with whatever they want 

416.40 420.56 A: well yeah and if you don't discipline them 

420.74 422.21 A: what are you doing 

422.59 424.46 B: (( exactly )) 

423.88 425.18 A: yeah i mean 

425.10 437.38 A: i'm a waitress and i like my job and i am excellent with children and the funny thing is people don't realize that the reason why when families come in they request me as a waitress 

426.30 427.23 B: uh-huh 

437.26 442.71 A: is because you know what if they don't have the guts to discipline their children i will 

442.41 444.17 B: yeah really 

443.58 450.76 A: if you come to a restaurant and you sit in my section and you think you're going to behave like a hooligan think again 

451.48 456.66 A: you're going to behave and you are going to learn some table manners and you know 

453.79 454.53 B: (( [laughter] )) 

454.98 456.65 B: well maybe you should 

456.97 460.41 B: maybe you should be a teacher then maybe you should be a teacher then 

457.04 458.82 A: kids need that 

460.43 463.08 A: well actually that's what i'm going to school as 

462.43 464.30 B: oh you are oh well that's 

463.71 465.66 A: yeah [laughter] 

464.71 468.35 B: good that's well then maybe the education system does have a chance 

468.78 473.29 A: i'm i'm going to school to be a teacher i know funny as that sounds 

472.63 475.71 B: that that's pretty cool the subject fits you 

476.26 482.79 A: but it i mean it it's something that you know it's it's hard because 

482.71 494.43 A: people even in the restaurant they're like i don't know how you get away with it you discipline other people's children and the thing is you know what i think most people would like to discipline their children and they are afraid to 

494.24 501.48 B: oh i know kids kids are well behaved when they come to my house because i just if if they get out of hand and they start hurting each other they're separated instantly and then they're 

501.26 511.45 B: lonely and bored you know they learn really quick that they can't be hitting each other and screaming at each other and that sort of thing i mean you can't have kids just running the whole place 

514.35 515.36 A: i mean 

515.52 519.03 A: i don't know it's just silly 

520.34 521.61 A: but i do 

521.58 522.93 A: think that our 

522.73 531.46 A: schools need to change and i think that part of the problem is we need to get the lawyers out of the classroom and get more teacher participation in 

531.24 538.05 A: we need parent participation too though because parents cannot expect teachers to be the mommy and the daddy 

537.87 546.92 B: well that there brings up a whole another subject about parents being able to afford to live and both having to work and you because everything's so expensive and it's pretty tough 

546.29 552.93 A: oh i understand that i mean because when i have children i would like to stay home but i doubt i'll be able to 

549.72 550.59 B: i 

552.48 563.88 B: yeah unless you can find something to arrange so you can it's it's really tough so they got to they got to figure out how to pay one one family member one parent enough money so that they other parent can stay home 

563.61 565.22 A: mhm 

564.11 565.24 B: you know what i mean 

566.27 568.59 B: we got a really bad connection here don't we 

569.13 570.60 A: no i can hear you 

570.26 571.93 B: (( oh you can hear me good oh okay )) 

571.84 575.65 A: well i can't believe that i can hear you though if you're in canada 

575.79 580.51 A: it's just funny to me that i'm talking to someone from canada [laughter] 

579.16 581.02 B: you've never talked to anyone from canada 

581.50 585.13 A: well actually um i'm bisexual 

584.75 585.68 B: uh-huh 

585.62 587.08 A: and i had a little 

587.53 592.35 A: sexual thing with a canadian the other day but besides that no 

592.19 599.89 B: ah you know what i find it funny that the americans think we're just a small little tiny place you know that's that goes back to education right there
