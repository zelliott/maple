189.12 202.62 B: yeah i mean they were trying to say you know hey we g- we got a great minority reporter here you know we want him to do as well as we can get him to do because it only makes us look good and instead you know 

194.12 195.10 A: right 

199.56 200.60 A: right 

202.66 205.47 B: rather than you know if the kid had talent

220.68 234.44 B: you know well we only did this because of the minority 'cause then they're going to look like they're prejudiced you know so they have to just cover up the incident so and that aspect of affirmative action is working against the purpose of it
