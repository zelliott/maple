142.18 144.01 B: (( oh )) 

155.28 157.12 B: (( oh ))

159.64 161.95 A: ten percent and you're increasing 

162.46 167.30 A: public ed- you could increase public edupending education funding by 

167.52 171.30 A: like seventy five or like sixty percent 

171.37 172.38 A: so 

173.92 178.20 A: ah it seems like they're doing a fairly good job with the amount of money that they are using though it

431.00 433.73 B: because i went to parochial school 

434.32 436.64 B: and i know children 

436.78 439.57 B: that go to parochial school and they would 

440.16 444.58 A: right now you know people that are you know people that are currently attending school 

440.23 442.01 B: you know they would watch 

444.74 446.25 B: ah excuse me 

446.24 447.50 A: you know people 

446.35 449.52 B: oh i and i have a ah child i 

449.62 454.92 B: want my child really to attend parochial school so 

454.85 465.04 B: the public even though i think you know i consider it the public school system good but i would like to have a ah put a you know if i had a child 

465.14 467.45 B: put them in parochial school 

467.88 469.51 B: that's even better 

469.87 471.58 A: why do you think that's better 

471.43 472.30 B: huh 

472.34 475.00 A: why do you you think that's better because for 

474.86 480.76 B: why do i think it's better well not that it's better it's just that um 

475.21 476.45 A: what reason 

480.60 482.13 A: that's your belief mhm 

481.34 483.46 B: i guess both um
