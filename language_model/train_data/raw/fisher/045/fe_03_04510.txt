13.02 14.03 B: d._c. 

14.51 21.00 A: oh excellent um do you want to start on the topic or how do you want to do this 

21.42 30.24 B: i'll go ahead and get started as far as their question is something wrong with the public schools my answer would my ans- 

27.35 28.61 A: yes there is 

28.95 30.49 A: right and 

30.57 32.61 A: go ahead i'm sorry 

31.81 33.73 B: (( mm oh yeah )) 

33.77 35.97 B: i answer an emphatic yes 

36.40 37.91 A: i would do too 

38.20 39.31 A: totally 

39.63 42.18 A: um i was trained to be a teacher 

42.32 47.71 A: and um left the field and went into another field because of some of the problems 

48.39 50.32 A: what do you think's wrong with them 

50.99 52.55 B: oh the problem is 

52.85 56.32 B: there's a wrong emphasis in terms of subject matter 

57.05 59.03 B: and 

57.34 58.24 A: uh-huh 

61.00 67.33 B: ah well there's a problem when say we want to teach the three rs yet two of them don't actually start with an r 

68.01 70.91 A: okay that's an interesting point 

71.32 73.64 A: um have you [mn] 

71.76 74.38 B: but we don't em- my 

74.29 75.38 A: go ahead 

74.77 78.14 B: what i think is a problem is we don't emphasize enough 

78.20 81.09 B: history and geography [laughter] 

81.97 92.83 A: very interesting because i was a history teacher i like to hear you say that [laughter] well i have a little bit different perspective and that is as an ex teacher 

92.84 95.57 A: that some of the conditions of teaching 

95.63 103.45 A: that were in the schools made it almost impossible to do a good job do you think there's any merit to that 

104.09 105.30 A: point of view 

105.56 111.73 B: i think so as well i mean there's just too much bureaucracy in terms of public schools 

106.12 106.68 A: (( [mn] )) 

111.38 119.74 A: and um perhaps overcrowded classrooms and s- students with problems so that 

115.85 117.64 B: mhm 

119.79 123.42 A: you're attention sometimes are everything but teaching 

123.75 128.77 A: but i agree with you also that ah where the emphasis is and you know 

128.93 132.10 A: what you're teaching now um do you have any children 

132.23 133.00 B: (( no )) 

133.43 134.28 A: pardon 

134.48 135.63 B: no none 

134.73 135.59 A: no 

135.97 140.67 A: well i have three grandchildren and all of them are in private schools 

140.47 142.28 B: mhm 

140.90 143.77 A: because of what you're talking about so i've seen 

144.09 147.72 A: what can happen in private school you know if the 

147.79 149.78 A: the appropriate resources 

149.95 152.85 A: the support of the parents right 

152.88 155.36 A: and most of all adequate funds 

153.02 154.81 B: mhm 

155.93 157.64 B: mhm 

156.99 158.06 A: yeah 

158.62 160.01 A: so um 

158.89 160.70 B: yeah 

160.69 163.51 A: what what do you think would correct the public schools 

164.45 174.22 B: ah it's hard to come up with anything simple i mean some more broad aspects like more parental involvement would help greatly 

173.83 174.68 A: uh-huh 

174.81 176.00 B: (( ah )) 

176.17 178.68 B: (( i support vouchers i i )) 

178.86 181.64 A: yes i do too i do too 

181.77 182.81 B: mean that's 

182.93 192.14 B: the complete incentive for public schools to actually get their act together otherwise people'd say we'd better spend more money on schools yeah but that's kind of rewarding failure 

192.90 194.19 B: saying you know if you're 

193.26 196.71 A: somewhat yeah it's real hard to get to isn't it 

196.73 197.64 B: mhm 

197.01 198.05 A: yeah 

198.43 206.28 A: you know i i have mixed feelings about vouchers and i'm always scared of blaming the victims you know because i met so many well 

206.65 210.18 A: capable caring teachers but just 

210.41 216.84 A: it was real hard for them to stay focused because of all their other assignments and some other problems in the schools 

217.00 217.74 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

217.14 221.59 A: you know i don't and i don't i'm like you i don't think it's a matter of just throwing more money at it 

221.92 226.67 A: [noise] i i mean i don't know if i can totally even say what i'd suggest 

227.06 229.51 A: at this point it overwhelms me do 

227.33 228.20 B: uh-huh 

229.43 237.02 B: mhm one problem i see from my perspective you probably won't like this but the unions teachers unions are too powerful 

237.94 242.92 A: you think um i never got involved i wasn't in it long enough to really get a 

242.95 246.81 A: a relationship or a bias on unions you know 

246.92 256.36 B: mm oh i'm from originally i'm from los angeles and i went to l._a. public schools and they have a huge union over there and it's got a lot of political clout 

251.75 252.68 A: uh-huh 

256.57 269.31 B: but one problem with that is they have a lot of rules about how to fire a teacher and we had stories of how teachers have been molesting children and they still can't get fired because of regulations 

256.84 257.47 A: uh-huh 

269.00 274.48 A: okay so issues of accountability they they're unable to hold somebody accountable 

271.64 272.93 B: mhm 

274.54 275.38 B: right 

274.69 284.40 A: i was i have a sister in law that's into teaching and she's very active actually in the union and i was interested they went out on strike once and their issues were 

284.55 286.78 A: the two i remember the most were 

286.85 290.72 A: that they were insisting on appropriate classroom size 

290.95 294.20 A: you know that wasn't even a personal gain per se 

294.27 302.91 A: and i was very impressed with that frankly that they were trying to fight to be good teachers by saying if you gave us a decent classroom size maybe we could do a better job 

303.16 309.76 A: and the other issue i thought was interesting they showed that with starting teachers in the state of michigan 

310.29 312.46 A: the salary was so low 

312.55 316.49 A: that they qualified for public assistance if they had a family 

315.33 316.64 B: mhm oh my god 

316.79 326.44 A: you know now they they have a high ceiling you know they can get to but starting salaries so they were saying it was difficult to ah recruit 

326.92 335.60 A: so i suspect that somewhere in the middle between you and i are the unions too powerful or maybe they're not fighting for the right things i don't know 

335.57 337.19 B: i guess it's more of a l- 

337.55 340.56 B: probably more of a locational thing 

340.57 344.15 A: yeah perhaps yeah g. now los angeles 

344.42 352.01 A: you know hasn't had just as detroit and michigan hasn't had very good press i think regarding some of their schools 

352.36 357.03 A: you know but i i didn't go to school in detroit i i went to school somewhere else 

357.68 363.30 A: but so i don't know if that's big city issues versus world versus all education you know 

364.11 370.52 A: i just know anybody to do a good job has to have a chance to be successful [laughter] you know pr- 

370.74 374.33 A: proper tools classroom size you get the idea 

374.89 379.08 B: mhm and also just content i mean just 

377.66 380.57 A: yeah and well go ahead yeah 

379.84 380.40 B: (( [mn] )) 

380.54 382.32 B: oh sorry do- but do they 

383.03 384.25 B: schools in michigan 

385.21 387.87 A: um which kind of schools i'm sorry 

387.89 388.88 B: magnet 

388.83 392.73 A: magnet schools i don't think i'm familiar with that term 

390.46 391.36 B: yeah 

392.72 397.37 B: mm maybe that's also a california thing but it's more of 

398.85 400.29 B: um 

400.38 407.18 B: i guess more a._t. style like i was in a magnet for high school and it was humanities focused 

407.41 411.38 B: and the classes were a lot more intensive than just the regular 

411.71 415.33 B: curriculum so we'd have a lot more writing in class 

413.01 418.00 A: what's like college prep like college prep type classes you mean 

417.35 419.30 B: yeah 

418.30 419.98 A: yeah yeah 

420.08 426.12 B: and i was thinking schools could benefit if they would just adopt all classes in that style 

426.12 429.10 A: did you got on to higher education 

428.94 430.91 B: mhm i have a masters degree 

430.96 431.93 A: (( so )) 

432.10 445.97 A: do i well that's interesting wonder how we got matched [laughter] but yeah yeah now i went to public schools but i'm an old lady and so i went early in the years before a lot of these issues were even talked about much 

434.20 436.84 B: (( hm [laughter] )) 

446.43 450.71 A: but like i have three granddaughters they're my daughter just decided 

451.67 456.67 A: she wasn't even going to fight it she was just going to pay the dollars and put them in a private school 

456.82 458.00 B: mhm 

457.39 458.35 A: so 

458.48 461.97 A: um i i can tell you from experience 

462.03 465.65 A: that's quite a financial commitment [laughter] 

464.94 466.70 B: mhm 

465.80 470.92 A: you know like we may not like the schools but are you willing to you know put your money you know 

471.57 475.52 A: um do you think that's the answer what she did pulling them out 

476.19 478.02 B: (( i don't know it's )) 

479.17 481.56 B: an individual thing 

482.07 482.99 A: right 

482.22 484.59 B: i guess but for 

484.92 488.84 B: as far as fixing the whole problem no but as far as one person goes yes 

489.54 492.79 A: you were talking about in your school you had to do a lot of writing 

489.81 490.72 B: (( mhm )) 

492.83 494.21 B: mhm 

492.85 494.61 A: you know i'm real serious 

494.83 499.23 A: i was just living with a girl for a while and building a home and ah 

499.39 506.27 A: her daughter has a three point nine g._p._a. and when she applied she's applying to holyoake 

506.33 518.82 A: you know back east and sher didn't have any writing examples she goes to a public school she didn't have any writing examples that they wanted her send she with those kind of grades she's taken all college pre advanced courses 

518.85 521.08 A: and nobody had ever had her write anything 

521.25 522.63 A: i was shocked 

523.21 524.53 A: just shocked 

524.78 528.43 A: yeah and you were saying you got a lot of writing assignments right 

528.41 530.18 B: mhm 

529.65 531.36 A: yeah yeah 

532.11 533.66 A: so um 

533.67 535.57 A: do you have any brothers or sisters 

535.50 536.91 B: i have a sister 

537.30 540.42 A: and so she too went to pub- ah went to public school 

540.36 547.62 B: she actually went to private school and she went to private school and when she was done there was no money left for me so i went to public 

548.06 551.80 A: oh ouch [laughter] 

551.04 554.24 B: oh that's benefit i guess of being the first born 

555.10 559.00 B: she was the beneficiary of primogeniture 

555.31 556.27 A: well 

559.54 565.87 A: so um did she um do well do you think i mean did it pay off for her to do that 

565.85 567.14 B: um 

565.94 566.81 A: you know yeah 

567.60 570.99 B: i think it was just unnecessary in her case because 

571.34 577.22 B: she went ah she's a graphic designer now and a lot of that came from her 

577.26 579.87 B: (( kind of innate artistic skills )) 

580.13 582.20 B: something that school like helped 

582.36 586.15 B: refine but a lot of what she had was already there 

586.24 588.56 B: and she took herself out of school 

588.79 591.49 B: so the private school's really unnecessary 

591.43 599.89 A: you know that's really interesting because i have a friend who's a college professor and we were just talking about these new schools and california's got some big ones online like corin-
