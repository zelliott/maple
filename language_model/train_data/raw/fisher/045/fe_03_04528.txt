0.90 2.81 A: hello this is anil 

1.16 2.24 B: (( hello )) 

2.98 4.82 B: uh this is beverley 

4.51 6.26 A: hi beverley 

5.65 6.92 B: how you doing 

6.60 8.62 A: (( good )) 

7.40 9.04 B: good do you want to start [noise] [noise] 

9.48 10.39 A: um 

10.40 12.52 A: (( sure i uh )) 

13.10 17.79 A: i think it sure is a good practice and it ought to be continued 

18.09 19.09 A: (( uh it )) 

19.23 25.21 A: the the affirmative action opens up a lot of possibilities for people who are 

25.37 29.34 A: otherwise not able to compete on equal basis 

29.85 30.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

31.66 42.34 B: um i agree i think it's a good policy i think it's very much needed in a lot of work places um due to the fact that um 

42.84 46.66 B: a lot of places aren't diversified 

47.12 52.26 B: and i think that it's um it gives the world a global 

52.72 57.07 B: you know outlook instead of looking through the eyes of one particular 

57.16 67.73 B: you know either males or females it it helps to um level the playing field so i definitely think uh that it's something needed very much uh needed and it should continue 

68.00 68.79 A: mhm 

68.87 77.34 A: yeah i agree most of the corporations still tend to do a lot of hiring from schools and um unless 

74.69 75.47 B: mhm 

77.42 81.64 A: no affirmative action is fed in directly into those schools 

81.66 82.59 A: um 

83.05 94.10 A: it you know it would be the the recruitment would be lopsided so uh for for corporations to actually make an effort to hire 

94.38 98.38 A: um based on the policies of affirmative action and then also 

98.31 112.77 A: after hiring to promote and mentor uh people based on these policies i think it it it goes a long way in um basically in dividing the the big gap between the haves and the have nots um 

112.70 116.44 B: right um the field that i work in is um 

116.55 123.19 B: television and so every day that i go into the board meeting for us to decide what we're going to put on our air 

123.39 135.71 B: it's me and it's um six other white males so i think that's one reason i mean nothing against white males and we do need them in that board meeting but we don't need six to one female 

127.98 129.24 A: [noise] 

135.88 137.56 B: so i think um 

135.92 137.26 A: right 

137.68 142.28 B: if programmes like affirmative action you know could help 

142.30 154.54 B: equal equalize that playing field i mean we need you know all races in there not just um white or not just black or not just hispanic we need asians and we need everyone so we can 

148.44 150.17 A: [lipsmack] yeah i agree 

154.46 161.66 B: you know 'cause we're telling people what's on you know we're giving people news i mean what's news to a white male 

158.34 159.79 A: (( mhm )) 

161.86 176.75 B: may not always be you know news to someone else so we need to have different nationalities in there to um provide news for asians african americans hispanics whites as well so i think it's very 

175.45 182.42 A: yeah absolutely and i think they way the whole um demographics of the nation is changing 

182.01 184.59 B: (( important )) 

182.44 186.45 A: um even though this policy may be uh 

186.91 193.24 A: beneficial to one sector at this time i think over over over a period of time 

192.97 194.24 B: yeah 

193.58 197.92 A: all the different races are going to equally benefit from such a policy 

197.45 207.43 B: right and i think that's just a matter of time once they establish that we do need it because i think it's up in the air right now people trying to say that we don't need it 

198.18 199.05 A: um 

200.42 202.13 A: right 

207.20 215.56 B: so once it's established that we do need this in our society i think it'll branch out to all types of nationalities 

215.45 220.83 A: yeah and you know over time i i personally would like it to see more 

221.38 223.37 A: oriented towards um 

223.38 231.47 A: affirmative action based on you know what how much money you have seems like p- people who are poor um 

227.66 230.30 B: mhm 

231.95 234.31 A: are people who cannot afford colleges 

234.44 235.85 B: (( right )) 

234.60 245.85 A: you know there are a lot of bright people who cannot afford to go to colleges and they miss out on a lot of opportunities in the corporate world so um so so at some point hopefully this whole uh 

241.43 242.46 B: that's true 

246.61 256.57 A: um process of affirmative action will be applied towards people who cannot afford to go to college people who cannot afford higher studies 

256.60 263.86 A: and give them a chance to to use this um process to achieve what they want to achieve yeah 

256.76 258.36 B: (( yeah )) 

261.27 262.31 B: to help 

262.71 263.93 B: them that's true 

264.02 277.65 B: i don't know where you live i live in texas so it's a big issue here with um you know the university of texas you know declining you know trying to take it out and everything and i know when i was at texas a and m. there was a big um 

278.26 285.90 B: you know rally being to to um you know try to stop affirmative action but it's it takes it's a really big issue 

285.29 294.72 A: mhm yeah i i live in north carolina in the roller durham area it it is really not that big a issue here because uh we have a very good school system 

288.79 289.83 B: oh okay 

294.02 297.08 B: mhm 

294.75 306.00 A: and um there are many many colleges that you know if you can't if a kid cannot get into the colleges which are you know expensive they can always get education at colleges which are less expensive 

305.93 306.87 B: oh really 

306.05 320.28 A: so um uh lot of people do use those opportunities and go and and then many many bright kids come out of those colleges and actually end up in corporate world working peer to peer with somebody who came out of duke so 

313.86 314.84 B: mhm 

320.45 327.05 A: um it's not that big of a deal here at this time but um i i have a feeling over time 

321.76 324.30 B: [noise] 

327.15 334.69 A: uh it probably could become a big deal based on the you know the the economic divide the haves and the have nots 

334.56 336.34 B: right 

334.93 338.57 A: and that that's always a possibility 

338.23 339.37 B: and um 

339.58 350.12 B: i i i'm t- for um went in affirmative action prog- a programme helped me get into grad school so i mean i'm i'm a witness that it works and it helps you 

350.74 360.24 B: get the job path that you want because i was given a like a grant or whatever for to go to university of nevada reno and work at a station 

360.40 366.57 B: you know s- right out of you know right out of college so i mean these programmes are beneficial and they do help 

366.48 378.96 B: you know the future of our kids growing up and you know help you know society as a whole and and like i said i'm like i'm the only one in that me- female in that meeting but i mean 

379.20 387.85 B: [mn] without that programme it could could have been you know seven whites you know what i mean for seven white males [noise] 

383.22 389.48 A: mhm right yeah yeah definitely yeah i i would agree i think diversity is very important in every field 

389.71 396.33 A: and more so in corporate field where people tend to make uh decisions on you know what products to make and what products to sell 

392.05 392.98 B: (( right )) 

396.17 397.48 B: right 

396.45 405.84 A: and if there is equal representation from all communities uh i think you will have a good breadth of uh products that will appeal to a bigger 

404.91 405.71 B: (( right )) 

405.88 410.50 A: bigger section of the population than just one specific um 

410.56 411.85 A: section 

412.14 421.56 A: so it definitely has some benefits and you know that that's where there's a lot of people who actually are are fighting in support of it 

420.56 429.44 B: yeah i don't know if people who are against it clearly understand that the entire you know process i mean i think they 

427.78 429.66 A: right 

429.59 435.59 B: think oh well i might not get a job because of affirmative action but basically what it does is it's helped 

435.65 439.69 B: it doesn't take necessarily takes jobs from you know 

439.61 453.10 B: various people but it just helps like i say equalize and helps others who are not as fortunate as others to get the opportunity but they're not less qualified or anything they just don't have that opportunity 

441.64 443.55 A: right and it 

446.83 447.95 A: yeah 

452.69 459.79 A: that's right i would think if anything else this would uh probably challenge each and every one of us to basically excel in what we do 

459.72 461.43 B: right 

460.09 464.96 A: um whether we you know whether we are economically well off or not 

464.61 466.32 B: mhm 

465.31 472.98 A: with the existence of these programmes we know that there is a chance that if we do good in our s- high schools and whatnot that 

473.30 477.35 A: you know we have a good chance of making something in our lives later on 

476.35 479.19 B: right yeah i agree 

479.20 481.40 A: absolutely um 

483.15 486.56 A: i'm not sure how long we're supposed to keep on talking on this [laughter] [laughter] 

486.38 488.85 B: i think it's just a few more minutes 

489.57 491.41 A: yeah i actually have um 

491.88 499.52 A: i work i work at in a networking company and there are a lot of different um backgrounds here people of different backgrounds 

499.21 500.39 B: right that's 

499.61 505.42 A: and it it really is interesting to see a mix of you know i when i walk in a meeting i 

505.47 509.57 B: (( good right )) 

505.72 512.91 A: don't have the same kind of problem that you just described because there is usually there are people with many many many different backgrounds 

512.89 514.81 B: yeah 

513.25 516.91 A: and from different races and and it always adds 

517.05 517.98 A: to 

518.04 519.90 A: the experience 

519.86 520.56 B: (( right )) 

519.94 527.70 A: um and not only we look at a given product from one person's point of view we also look at from all the other people's point of views 

527.30 528.60 B: yeah that's true 

528.48 536.12 A: and you know i also think that you know economically we all reap the benefits of such an such an action 

536.47 537.37 A: um 

537.61 544.67 A: there are a lot of people from uh minority races who are very very well off in in the company i work for 

544.01 546.61 B: oh definitely yeah 

544.78 547.00 A: so um you know 

547.95 554.16 A: by such a process being there they have been able to make use of it 

554.23 555.18 B: right 

554.90 566.92 A: now i mean i'm not saying they're here simply because of affirmative action [laughter] but i'm pretty sure quite a few of them have been able to you know make a break with the help of that that policy 

565.22 578.38 B: yeah yeah now i just think it's a good tool i mean it gives people um just a chance to succeed i mean a lot of people um their situation is not 

578.29 583.77 B: you know for the good and so this gives them a chance to look at something maybe break 

583.78 584.71 B: you know 

584.64 598.68 B: with what the family history has been doing and it just gives them a opportunity to do something better for themselves and succeed so i i think it's definitely needed and especially in corporate america [laughter] 

592.54 593.47 A: yeah 

598.54 599.89 B: like i say you know
