167.24 168.14 A: right 

167.76 174.70 B: but i also don't think that people should get promotions just based on affirmative action i don't think it's right 

174.29 175.10 A: true 

174.75 178.49 B: and i think people should get paid should get promotions 

179.05 180.30 B: based on 

180.44 184.90 B: merit that they've earned that that they have the ability to hold those positions 

185.47 188.49 B: uh not because they happen to be 

189.68 191.29 B: a different color 

191.59 192.58 A: correct 

192.28 193.50 B: and um mm 

193.50 199.62 A: yeah that's uh there's there's positives and negatives and i think it sounds like we agree 

200.08 200.90 B: yeah 

200.24 202.72 A: on that aspect of it it's uh 

202.97 207.23 A: you know if someone's been been doing a job for 

207.43 209.01 A: ten years and they're 

209.64 211.42 A: r- and they're the most 

211.58 213.31 A: then they're the best candidate 

213.34 214.31 B: (( mhm )) 

213.99 217.45 A: it doesn't matter who they are they need to get that position 

217.72 219.50 B: absolutely i 

218.49 220.89 A: and when and and i'd 

221.25 222.51 A: i have 

222.81 224.95 A: heard of times when someone 

225.18 226.43 A: that is 

226.82 232.19 A: in a quote unquote minority position has gotten that um that's 

229.95 231.13 B: mhm 

232.91 235.19 A: (( i- i- i understand )) 

236.12 238.65 A: why sometimes it has to happen but 

239.26 242.48 A: don't necessarily always agree with it i always say it should be done on merit 

242.51 251.47 B: should be done on merit i mean i i ran a large organisation before i retired and i had a lot of um [noise] african americans working in my company 

246.02 246.87 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

251.84 262.43 B: and i personally promoted the best i di- i didn't look for cr- [noise] i didn't even in some cases i didn't even know who the guy w- i mean i knew his name but i didn't know what race he was 

262.22 263.32 A: right 

262.66 276.38 B: and i would select his name just based on his like last five year performance say he'd make a good supervisor or he'd make a good manager he got promoted it's only afterward i realized that [noise] this guy was black or he was hispanic 

267.22 268.02 A: (( right )) 

270.90 271.59 A: (( yeah )) 

276.00 277.03 A: mhm 

276.39 278.66 B: didn't matter to me 'cause he was doing a good job 

278.30 279.30 A: i agree 

280.54 281.62 B: it uh 

281.56 283.45 A: i do i mean the 

283.57 288.64 A: the whole purpose uh like you said earlier it gets back to 

288.67 291.67 A: really if if they would've just 

292.36 294.81 A: if putting affirmative action 

294.84 295.83 B: (( mhm )) 

295.19 304.40 A: together and they would have stuck to the original plans of hey we want to get w- want to have a more diverse company or we want to allow 

305.03 307.60 A: minorities more opportunities 

307.06 308.06 B: (( mhm )) 

308.36 309.86 A: concept's great 

310.11 313.47 A: but it has been i mean bottom line it it's been abused 

313.31 321.83 B: it has been abused um and bu- but on the same token uh as i said before everyone is entitled to a fair crack at the whip 

321.50 322.17 A: (( yep )) 

322.04 325.06 B: (( and they should not be discriminated upon by )) 

325.08 325.77 B: (( y- )) 

326.26 327.79 B: any aspect i mean 

327.70 328.51 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

327.90 328.96 B: religion 

329.64 331.81 B: height weight i 

332.06 335.49 B: mean even even fat people are getting discriminated against 

335.15 335.93 A: (( yep [noise] [noise] )) 

335.51 337.55 B: and i don't think that's right either 

337.74 342.96 A: yep i just uh lost thirty five pounds so hopefully that won't happen to me [laughter] 

342.17 351.86 B: yeah that's good that's good well i'm a slim one sixty two so i don't worry about it but there's a lot of discrimination goes on uh it's human nature to 

346.75 347.82 A: yeah 

351.86 361.32 B: [cough] 'cause you know certain parts of the country it's just ingrained in the character that you're not going to like blacks or you're not going to like um uh 

355.97 356.72 A: yeah 

356.95 358.10 A: (( absolutely mhm )) 

361.56 362.77 B: new yorkers 

363.21 367.10 B: or you're not going to like hispanics i mean it's ingrained in you and you can't get away from 

366.91 367.93 A: yeah 

367.27 370.94 B: it it's just like people who com- whose parents 

371.19 376.12 B: and their grandparents vote democrat they will automatically vote democrat you know 

375.96 377.20 A: most often mhm 

376.74 380.80 B: (( yeah most of them and the same on the other side republicans do the same thing )) 

381.78 382.95 B: but um 

383.61 386.12 B: i'm not so sure that affirmative action 

386.22 390.34 B: will be necessary i i think it's going to be necessary for the ne- next fifty 

390.44 394.30 B: fifteen or twenty years but i think it's b- gradually going to have to be phased out 

395.50 397.87 B: and just let people earn their living 

397.98 399.49 B: earn their promotions 

399.67 401.73 B: on their abilities 

401.60 403.57 A: yeah i i just think that 

404.40 406.90 A: you know in the u._s. that we've become 

407.58 413.36 A: the whole u._s. has become more of a melting pot than just the major cities and and that's 

410.24 411.01 B: yeah 

414.13 417.83 A: you know just going to be part of every day now so 

417.86 420.76 A: i i think that your statement has some merit 

420.61 422.62 B: (( yeah i mean you [laughter] th- )) 

422.86 426.92 B: it's not going to back you're not going to go back to the way things were a hundred years ago 

426.72 427.54 A: right 

427.32 430.79 B: the people are here they're living here they're working here 

431.25 433.93 B: and everyone [laughter] i mean 

434.20 448.07 B: they'll never reintroduce the past they got to accept the fact that these people are here and they're going to live here and they're going to need to be to get good jobs like everybody else and earn a good living and let them raise their kids in good schools i mean that's 

436.80 438.00 A: (( let's hope not mhm )) 

448.44 449.79 B: i think it's only fair 

449.53 452.06 A: yep it's the american way [laughter] 

450.02 450.81 B: yeah 

451.62 454.08 B: you got it the american way
