0.39 3.75 B: (( hi i'm philippe uh leipzig who are you )) 

3.47 6.66 A: hi i'm dale brown uh california 

6.43 10.61 B: oh okay i'm oh yeah i'm from california too i'm from c._u. city actually 

10.24 11.34 A: oh okay 

10.74 13.41 B: so uh what do you think of affirmative action 

13.40 19.33 A: uh i believe in it i believe it's it's still necessary in the times we are living in 

19.64 20.82 A: (( um )) 

21.81 28.54 A: i believe [sigh] uh there's still not equality or fairness in the job place 

28.41 29.65 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

29.10 30.49 A: and um 

31.07 37.69 A: [mn] no matter what we put on as a cover or smile there's still some un- injustices in un- in 

37.74 45.92 A: things that are not equal or not a playing field and we still need laws to help it make a player field for every man and woman so we can 

46.63 49.51 A: i don't know work together how you feel about it 

48.89 59.49 B: well i think i feel uh in a democracy i feel affirmative action is very important um um we nee- we need i mean uh today the rich get richer the poor get poorer 

53.80 54.58 A: (( mm )) 

59.20 60.41 A: right 

59.78 68.48 B: [laughter] and so uh in order to uh to balance this you need to be able to a voice i mean to have your voice uh somewhere 

68.29 69.54 A: mhm 

68.89 79.36 B: no some people because uh i have another caller tell that it may be too much affirmative action i don't know because i'm not in politics so it's very difficult for me to you know to have a general 

79.41 90.55 B: general idea of what's going on in affirmative action but uh being myself in a minority i will set a cer- certainly encourage affirmative action to to still be here 

82.61 83.57 A: mhm 

87.85 88.81 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

90.02 91.43 A: (( mm right )) 

90.82 96.47 B: (( no matter what um without affirmative action we will be in big big trouble okay )) 

96.26 97.96 A: (( right uh )) 

96.59 101.36 B: (( [laughter] so uh yeah i'm for affirmative action obviously so [mn] )) 

100.92 107.88 A: yeah i i just believe that i- in the times that we're living in i mean even i i see it where you know um you know 

107.83 111.52 A: america uh you know w- like you said this whatever th- 

111.33 124.98 A: they believe in the system that the strong s- shall survive and the strong devour up the weak and you know we live in in a a cultural multicultural society but it has to be equal playing field a voice has to be heard 

122.97 123.73 B: yes 

124.49 125.31 B: uh-huh 

124.75 132.66 A: some some of the greatest minds if it wasn't for an affirmative action you know wouldn't be it n- congressmen or senators now 

132.49 133.62 B: (( yes mhm )) 

133.07 142.36 A: that you know or you know even for our children you know and and for especially women an- an- an- an- and mothers it's important that um 

142.75 146.52 A: that our voices we keep an equal playing field 

146.53 159.24 A: an- and even as it when it comes to schools you know i i believe that uh it's not even it's not the environment but if you take a child out of the environment and give them a chance you you never know what he'll excel to 

159.30 166.56 A: if you equal the playing field b- but if they're saying but they're saying that well if you don't have the money and resources or will then 

160.96 161.96 B: yeah 

166.57 169.22 A: and and then that's not fair [mn] 

168.86 177.61 B: yeah no i agree with that the only problem i have with affirmative action or in general with what's going on with the news the news are misleading you 

177.52 178.63 A: right 

177.67 188.03 B: because all the time you know uh people are waiting for drama and you don't have uh you don't have uh so people sometimes say it's too much affirmative action but unfortunately it's entertainment 

181.27 182.49 A: right 

187.61 189.45 A: (( [noise] right )) 

187.98 197.31 B: and uh uh it's why sometime people are upset because it's too much but guess what when we have an earthquake you see only the building falling you don't see the building which stay 

197.29 200.89 B: (( stay there because if you see it's not entertainment so )) 

200.10 201.95 A: right 

200.74 206.46 B: so people have ze- uh have a very wrong idea of what's going on when you watch the news 

206.23 217.14 B: to read books is probably better to be more to go to school you know to be more educated about it and to do something about it [laughter] instead of just to to listen to propaganda one way or another 

211.75 212.93 A: (( mhm )) 

213.08 214.09 A: (( mhm )) 

217.09 223.12 B: and yeah and people have tendency to be to be sheep uh sheeps and not individual 

217.10 218.88 A: right 

223.16 229.39 B: especially be in my country i was born in switzerland uh they are j- just for you know they are neutral but then 

229.30 235.61 B: their honesty is more like following authority and if authorities say that is stealing is bad [lipsmack] 

235.44 250.01 B: then uh they will not steal but if authorities say that it's okay they may steal [laughter] but i do say we need the more philosophy in our in our life and more education and uh minority uh you know i mean uh affirmative action is uh 

245.02 246.08 A: (( [mn] right )) 

250.05 256.59 B: you need to be aware of what's going on and i i don't think so the news give you the the right idea of what's going on 

256.33 259.19 A: and i believe and i believe um uh i think uh 

259.11 267.94 A: uh what you're saying is very true because i believe that even the uh news media's become a political uh vehicle 

267.75 279.46 A: for certain political views instead of having a a a bipartisan that's the word i wanted to say be bipartisan when it comes to affirmative action or something like that it's just one is really you're hearing 

269.79 270.79 B: (( yes mm yes mhm )) 

279.46 293.91 A: a uh the political right when it comes to f- you know affirmative action you're hearing really one side of of a party that really wants to say you know this is how we feel about it instead of having a a neutral or a a a bipartisan 

293.84 296.27 A: uh view on affirmative action 

296.10 309.91 A: because i believe we wouldn't co- be here as come this far as a country if it wasn't for affirmative action and there are people who have given their lives have have have white yellow red black the whole multi cultural rainbow 

309.89 316.89 A: of people who have actually given their lives for this for th- for us to have an equal playing field and i'm 

315.71 328.35 B: yeah and there's also a wonderful country because here you can really express yourself and you can even criticize your president which is what's part of democracy and its you know it's okay to to say what you you want to say 

320.31 321.42 A: (( right mhm )) 

322.65 323.74 A: mhm 

328.27 332.36 B: and if you take affirmative action out of uh you know of a picture 

332.26 334.00 A: mhm 

332.43 336.21 B: uh its kind of you take part of a democracy that we are so 

336.37 337.63 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

337.30 347.54 A: true and you see and that's what i'm saying but you hear the president saying well you know wis- we don't we're no longer living in these times and i believe that societies may have changed the face of societies may change but 

347.45 354.25 A: you know we still have a long way to go and a long way to grow in becoming a uh uh uh 

354.19 361.77 A: a multi equal you know basis we still carry some old philosophies and i still believe 

361.69 365.80 A: that we have to still for for especially young people 

365.71 371.64 A: uh you know i believe ev- even these young uh people out here now they're saying what's happening to our generation 

371.43 386.27 A: we have to make it uh uh uh equal balance system for them to try and even reach for other things beyond and what they're seeing in their in their cities or what they're seeing even in poor neighborhoods and i believe affir- affirmative action is the vehicle toward this 

386.29 399.64 A: and you see so many people want to take it off of uh the federal and take it out of the state and and take it out of all these levels where you know this is still a viable vehicle that is needed in d- in society today 

399.40 405.33 B: yeah unfortunately you know when people have freedom they don't use it [laughter] but i could say for example 

403.29 404.76 A: mhm oh 

405.40 415.60 B: votation in switzerland you know most no people vote because you can but then you think you would not change anything and i guess it's a little the same here 

407.60 408.25 A: (( mm )) 

412.88 413.97 A: mhm 

415.53 424.86 B: uh so uh you have a you know you can talk but people don't talk because they think sometimes not important and i i believe that it's important 

415.62 416.33 A: mm 

424.87 428.90 B: because if you don't talk then you can lose your freedom you know one point so [mn] 

428.41 438.97 A: true true and as and i- b- i'm a firm believer in that that the um d- the voice of affirmative action needs to be said and spoken of in each the outcry still needs to be voiced but we 

429.23 430.02 B: (( mhm )) 

438.76 446.65 A: we're told not to rock the boat about the issue and try to go along and get along w- w- we know we still need to speak up for what's right 

446.17 452.42 B: yeah and also to be objective about it because uh if you you know if you are against something 

446.83 447.50 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

452.58 459.18 B: and you go to the extreme you will not achieve anything you know i mean if you act violent against violence 

455.51 456.43 A: right 

458.91 459.77 A: yeah 

459.14 468.82 B: it doesn't work because then somebody will hate oh i'd you can't impress everybody but what i have to say to be smart about it as well you know to be educated about it 

460.36 461.34 A: right 

461.83 462.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

466.79 473.21 A: yeah w- well the same policies that martin luther king had i mean i b- i- there can a peaceful demonstration when it comes to this 

469.89 470.67 B: yeah 

473.00 473.75 B: yeah 

473.16 474.75 A: (( you know we can )) 

474.57 479.61 A: we can speak and stand and have and speak for peace about it but we we need to just 

479.42 489.66 A: have our voices heard because you know like i said i believe that the vehicles that made this country made this country great are still applicable they still must be applied 

489.33 490.18 B: yes 

489.99 498.90 A: and there's no thinking well it was good then and not good now well if it was good for the country at all and it's and it's we're still growing then it we still need it 

498.47 507.35 B: yeah yeah a- another thing also uh tha- is not the topic of today but uh b- for example cellular phone okay 

506.51 508.16 A: mhm mhm 

507.46 515.81 B: it's the same with mine i mean uh you know uh political action or whatever it is people have a tool but then we are rude with it 

516.22 517.33 A: right 

516.57 528.33 B: so you need to uh to you know to use the tool without excess to use the tool smart and to be smart smart about it and not to to abuse the system because then it doesn't go anywhere 

520.26 521.57 A: right 

528.22 537.65 A: yeah and then you have people who want to abuse the system yeah well if i can get a you know those and and i believe i believe there's checks and balances to everything 

537.35 539.72 B: yeah you need you need we need to have a 

537.51 544.89 A: and and you know but even with that there need to be checks and balances to make it work just like country there has to be checks and balances 

544.42 545.56 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

545.24 556.01 A: to make it viable an- and with affirmative action if we had uh uh closer checks and balances who's trying to abuse the system who's not trying to abuse the system and you know it won't work 

555.69 556.91 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

556.56 563.08 A: you know i- it's just like anything in this country there has to be a checks check and balance system in everything 

561.73 564.37 B: yeah it's just a very long process [laughter] 

563.85 565.26 A: yes 

564.46 569.19 B: yeah and uh you know it doesn't and i hope you know that we continue to have war 

569.23 578.75 B: so sometime uh i i i wonder what what do we learn from the past because we continue to repeat the same mistakes of the past um 

577.83 585.25 A: see an- an- and that's the thing [laughter] w- w- we keep repeating but when we learn from it is when we can grow from it 

584.92 597.07 B: yeah and we have to remember also we are individuals so you have good and bad person in every ethnic group in every color scheme or whatever it is and uh you need to be an individual and most other people are just following uh 

587.73 588.52 A: (( mm )) 

591.76 592.93 A: mhm 

597.15 598.23 B: a leader 

598.32 599.37 A: right 

598.33 599.89 B: (( and if a leader is good or ))
