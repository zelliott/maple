2.58 3.76 B: (( [noise] hello )) 

3.59 4.87 A: [noise] hello 

4.95 6.71 B: hello my name's roxanne 

7.14 8.65 A: my name is ilago 

8.99 10.35 A: [noise] 

10.50 12.48 B: i understand we're supposed to uh 

12.80 15.62 B: discuss affirmative action for ten minutes i guess 

12.96 13.86 A: we're talking 

14.86 16.76 A: (( [laughter] )) 

17.33 20.17 A: [lipsmack] yes uh to me that's what the uh 

21.08 23.22 A: what they call the the issue with oh 

21.85 24.15 B: [noise] yeah the topic of the day 

24.00 25.75 A: the topic of yes 

25.56 26.50 B: okay 

26.25 29.67 A: oh what what what's your opinion about that 

30.30 32.34 B: [sigh] you know [lipsmack] 

32.71 35.57 B: it's a it's a very difficult issue i think uh 

35.70 46.57 B: [noise] [lipsmack] if there are a number of uh individuals who are equally qualified i think there are uh there are places where affirmative action probably [sigh] is appropriate as long as uh 

46.63 53.01 B: [sigh] the people fit the bill in other words they have qualifications for whatever job or [sigh] position it might be [noise] [noise] [noise] 

52.41 53.37 A: yes way 

53.59 56.54 A: [noise] see nowadays on uh [lipsmack] 

57.02 58.53 A: on this issue 

59.21 61.41 A: there are certain 

61.47 64.52 A: [noise] uh places of uh 

64.83 65.94 A: of jobs 

66.95 72.88 A: it's for example sometimes it's a white collar [sigh] or a blue collar [sigh] 

73.40 80.41 A: [lipsmack] or a [sigh] some of these jobs in city county [sigh] companies 

80.56 82.54 A: (( [sigh] there is a word )) 

82.58 83.64 A: (( that [sigh] )) 

83.80 87.98 A: i always heard when people are talking about promotion 

87.66 88.67 B: mhm 

88.61 91.22 A: and they said [lipsmack] it's not what you 

92.42 102.54 A: but it's it's [sigh] who you know do you understand some of those kind of words they come out with those people when they promote somebody into the this 

96.25 97.27 B: mhm 

104.29 112.95 A: [sigh] what do you think [sigh] what i was talking about when when when they cut into those kind of issues that's mean evaluation is not being done right 

112.84 114.58 B: mhm 

114.07 115.12 A: and uh 

116.59 118.04 A: [sigh] they are 

118.26 121.19 A: picking somebody into uh different promotions 

121.27 123.98 A: because of knowing s- that person 

123.75 127.69 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah well and and there are other things too [lipsmack] um 

124.47 125.41 A: and that 

127.87 137.10 B: you know i think generally when you talk about affirmative action you think about promoting someone of a minority group [sigh] but it can work the other way too um 

137.80 138.78 A: [sigh] what yeah 

137.86 138.39 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

138.26 152.93 B: uh a person i know very well is in a an engineer within the city system in the city where i live and uh [sigh] uh generally they're paying a lot of attention to how many [sigh] [noise] uh minorities are promoted so basically for some of the higher jobs it 

152.69 159.33 B: it's almost become the opposite of what it used to be where um [sigh] uh they're looking for black women or um 

159.29 170.35 B: uh [sigh] non caucasian people to fill the bill and they're not looking at qualifications at all but really th- they're just looking at quotas [sigh] so it can work in uh in both directions i think uh [sigh] 

170.16 177.77 B: whatever decisions are made have to made by people who really um [sigh] can fulfill the job but it think it needs to be fair [noise] 

177.23 184.94 A: yes uh i think you you got the the most important uh [sigh] uh issue [noise] when they come out to uh some of those kind of 

185.02 191.94 A: [sigh] areas like minority [sigh] because sometimes [noise] they i believe they have something like what what you mentioned quotas 

191.44 192.44 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

192.29 200.62 A: yeah they have uh certain quotas [sigh] to establish [noise] [sigh] this is in in depend to what type of policy the company can have 

199.94 210.66 B: [noise] yeah see the city will do it in favor i think of minorities [sigh] in private business it seems that the white male [laughter] the white male gets the benefit most of the time 

205.49 206.33 A: yes 

207.19 208.57 A: [laughter] 

210.21 218.71 A: well this is how m- many of these things happen [sigh] but most of the government i b- i i believe the government always establish a a certain position 

218.66 221.12 A: in to establish the quota 

220.64 221.75 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

221.04 229.43 A: in in cert- in minority in in [noise] into what group uh this had to fill up this this uh area [sigh] 

229.31 237.88 A: and that's how they've been able to look in and evaluate [sigh] the uh the [sigh] [lipsmack] the prospect or or whom- whomever sort of 

236.42 241.77 B: mhm i i think they try to reflect the percentage of the population of the city or the 

241.23 242.83 A: yes that's another thing 

241.78 244.21 B: the municipality where they are sure 

243.33 248.93 A: looking into it so those are very good [sigh] uh a point the [mn] [sigh] 

249.20 255.65 A: and uh if some comp- [mn] some company uh or or some area they're very opposed this issue 

256.14 269.09 A: they just whatever comes or first come first served those kind of things like that and [laughter] i i and i found out th- th- there's probably n- no establishing policy [sigh] 

259.18 260.81 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

269.07 280.45 A: or because sometimes they always have to look [lipsmack] what policy do they have and some of this policy they have to be reevaluate every six months to a year 

280.04 281.39 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

280.58 290.22 A: [sigh] uh and certain things it's it it well it whoev- whomever is uh [sigh] uh is holding the the highest positions of controlling 

289.28 303.90 B: [noise] mhm [sigh] well and it it even goes down to education now 'cause i think uh [lipsmack] you know there's some i know there's been some controversy at the university of michigan where uh [lipsmack] [sigh] uh they would like to very much maintain a uh 

303.86 313.16 B: uh diversity within the university yet if they completely [noise] disregard any kind of nationality or whatever [sigh] um 

313.10 318.92 B: you know things may work out to be very unfair so i think there's actually a suit going on right now there 

318.81 320.73 A: is that right well it's 

318.93 322.37 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] um trying to turn over affirmative action 

321.21 322.03 A: yes 

322.52 327.79 A: well those those are the things we look into it because [sigh] the only thing we're looking at because 

328.12 331.10 A: our nation is not the same as th- 

331.23 332.55 A: other nations 

332.11 333.44 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

333.02 343.81 A: see we have a well established constitution and everything that falls into it so these are the things that [laughter] it's all under the bills it's it's all under the law 

337.34 338.86 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

343.99 345.30 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

344.64 349.77 A: and that's why l- y- you know this nation is is really stand firm 

351.10 360.16 A: [sigh] when those kind of areas i- it's look like it's been neglected evaluating [sigh] then there goes a law suit [laughter] [laughter] yeah [sigh] [lipsmack] 

358.62 359.57 B: mhm 

360.18 361.36 A: and i believe it 

360.63 369.71 B: well and i think everyone looks at it in a personal way too [sigh] if it happens to be your child or your niece or something like that and they happen to be [sigh] um 

363.56 364.21 A: (( mm )) 

369.70 378.07 B: you think they're victimized by the way the rules go then it when it becomes real personal i think uh [sigh] it gets harder to uh look at it objectively you know 

377.37 392.14 A: yes that's uh another important area we can look both ways [laughter] and evaluate both sides so [sigh] a- a- and f- the main reasons we we're looking at it's just to to maintain the balance and and equal [sigh] into it's uh 

380.66 381.61 B: (( mm [noise] [noise] )) 

392.54 401.88 A: fair way [sigh] freedoms understanding and all those kind of [mn] areas like this but [sigh] in when it comes to a promotion area [sigh] 

393.71 396.28 B: (( [mn] mhm mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

401.95 406.47 A: and [sigh] sometimes uh it is difficult 

406.97 419.61 A: [noise] when they evaluate the person [noise] and if if there were about six or or seven o- of them there are about equal the same uh [noise] 

419.62 424.76 A: same thing they'd been doing they are very doing uh intelligently then uh 

424.80 434.27 A: who's going to make a decision it's going to be tough [sigh] you look into the evaluation they'd say i don't know who's going to call [lipsmack] who's going to call to take over because i believe 

431.53 432.48 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

433.26 447.83 B: if it's going to be done by committee or the senior person [sigh] and it's usually someone that's the most similar to the person in power or the person highest up you know i uh [sigh] they they're looking for someone they can easily relate to [noise] [lipsmack] and sometimes that isn't always fair you know 

434.94 436.40 A: yes [sigh] c- 

441.09 442.07 A: yes 

442.19 442.95 A: so 

445.19 446.05 A: (( mhm )) 

449.67 450.68 A: (( yeah yeah [noise] they )) 

450.98 456.87 A: [sigh] it it's very important because sometimes when when you hold a very high position 

457.21 462.49 A: (( you're looking down into a into who has been a )) 

463.47 466.92 A: who's been in the candidate to a certain position [sigh] 

466.93 471.43 A: and then you look into it and [noise] and and de- and try to define 

471.55 473.54 A: what value and uh 

473.94 479.70 A: [lipsmack] uh what is the quality and all those kind of things that you're looking at to the person [sigh] 

479.32 480.52 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm mhm [noise] )) 

479.87 482.47 A: sometimes you probably don't know the person 

482.63 489.96 A: [sigh] and you're looking into all the the rest of them and every the biography of those [sigh] [noise] things that bring the persons up 

483.05 483.85 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

489.73 490.74 B: mhm 

489.93 503.16 A: [sigh] so [lipsmack] the either way when you gonna be able to evaluate [sigh] knowing the person or not knowing the person [lipsmack] [sigh] so [laughter] and probably the when it comes to the interview that's probably 

503.11 510.64 A: reflected [noise] to w- whi- which which directions you going into when you're going to find out [sigh] and 

510.88 512.81 A: [noise] and some of those areas 

512.81 522.26 B: [noise] yeah and and you hope uh [sigh] i i think it in many ways it's a matter of conscience in terms of how fair people are about uh [sigh] these kinds of things you know [mn] [sigh] [noise] 

520.86 522.04 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

522.19 522.92 B: (( um )) 

522.72 533.04 B: th- they tend to favor people who went to certain schools or people who are [noise] from certain areas or whatever uh [lipsmack] uh you know sometimes you can never even detect whether [noise] things are done uh 

532.91 538.24 B: [sigh] a hundred percent fairly you know you just hope that things have changed [noise] and uh [sigh] 

538.31 550.07 B: over the years 'cause i know in the past uh [mn] certainly is a real uh there was a real need for affirmative action [laughter] certainly [noise] uh you know people in power brought in other people who were similar to them so uh 

544.57 545.34 A: yes 

545.57 546.89 A: yeah uh 

550.18 551.85 B: you know it makes it very difficult [noise] [noise] 

550.30 554.40 A: and sometimes we're looking at [sigh] that people in the the different [noise] 

554.57 567.64 A: uh [mn] uh other other directions [sigh] because uh we look into the positions [sigh] how the position is going to better the way you think [sigh] and how the position's going to be uh more uh [noise] 

567.51 571.34 A: [sigh] uh profits y- that's they way we're looking at [sigh] 

571.69 575.86 A: so it's if we look into the different uh a person 

575.97 577.59 A: in a way a 

578.01 580.35 A: a we evaluate 

580.49 594.49 A: and sometimes we we look into it for the security [sigh] all those kind of things [sigh] because sometimes we always look into the background [sigh] if a person seems fit to be in you know not uh [noise] 

585.64 587.20 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

595.98 599.89 A: not discriminating some other stuff or things like that [sigh] 

599.15 599.89 B: oh sure
