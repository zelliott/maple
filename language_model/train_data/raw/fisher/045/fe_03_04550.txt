24.84 38.27 A: yeah it's very ver- uh hey i'd like to be in las vegas right now but not till uh affirmative action i think affirmative action's unfair i think it had its place once but i think at this point it's become a crutch for too many

30.44 31.41 B: yeah 

37.87 44.78 B: [sigh] you know what i agree with you a hundred percent so how are we going to talk about this for ten minutes [laughter] 

42.46 43.98 A: (( i don't know but we but )) 

43.85 47.58 A: well you well you know the the problem is see he you know 

47.35 58.43 A: they w- y- affirmative action had a valued thing there were many inequities in society and there are still are we're not a perfect society you know and i i i'm fairly conservative almost libertarian 

54.03 54.95 B: right 

58.13 59.10 B: mhm 

58.24 65.85 A: but i can admit we're not a perfect society and there were many inequities but at some point people have to go on their own 

66.15 68.00 A: [sigh] uh skills 

67.43 68.44 B: mhm 

67.81 81.42 A: you know it's you know it's time to stop babying and s- get an education stay in school don't get people pregnant uh you know don't get people pregnant uh you know try and uh have a kid and you know [sigh] 

81.23 95.86 A: try and you know do the right thing and if you if you bust your butt and ev- if you are an underprivileged class no matter race whatever [sigh] whether economically or whatever [sigh] you got to work twice as hard well 

83.71 84.67 B: mhm 

95.15 96.17 B: mhm 

96.01 101.28 A: (( you know my p- my f- forefathers came from overseas and had to do the same thing ))

102.99 105.18 B: oh okay i'm a year older than you 

104.81 105.37 A: (( yeah )) 

105.19 117.69 B: and so i mean i even remember when affirmative action started and [sigh] and i was a kid but i remember knowing and understanding that it it was meaningful and it was a really good thing [sigh] but i think like you do that's 

117.69 124.29 B: totally gone too far it's gone the opposite direction and now it's unfair to to just normal average white people 

124.01 131.96 A: (( well it doesn't have to be just white people i understand that you know it's people it's basically at this point )) 

132.11 134.84 A: (( you know white and that's good enough no matter whatever )) 

135.03 147.77 A: (( you know it's at this point people's opin- people have to start going on their own powers and if they're of a traditionally a traditional passage that had everything against them then they will work twice as hard i mean my )) 

139.57 140.39 B: yeah 

147.80 160.32 A: (( grandparents great grandparents my great grandparents came from poland or russia and they you know the first thing they did is learn english now i'm on the phone most of the day and you wouldn't believe how many people don't speak english )) 

151.92 152.88 B: mhm 

159.82 162.34 B: oh believe me here in las vegas 

161.67 167.58 A: (( hey i'm switching to a regular phone too much static on the other one [noise] yeah how's that ))

168.67 169.73 A: okay now 

169.52 171.72 B: it was getting to the point where i couldn't hear you 

171.21 177.19 A: yeah so but you know bottom line is you know about half the people i speak to well they don't even speak english 

176.57 184.58 B: [sigh] one of the things that bothers me is um here in las vegas if you look at the the the help wanted ads [sigh] most 

184.63 197.27 B: [mn] a lot of them say you must be bilingual [sigh] and what bothers me is that i grew up in america where english is my language and i shouldn't be expected to know spanish and have to not [sigh] be able to get a job i want because i don't know spanish 

195.51 196.23 A: well 

196.49 207.88 A: well unfortunately we're turning uh y- we're one step away from becoming like canada you know where fran- you know you have to there are parts of the country which if you you have to learn it has to be in fr- uh french 

200.56 201.56 B: mhm 

207.47 208.46 B: yeah 

207.88 222.87 A: you know you know like you know i'm having my kids learn uh spanish at school because it's the fastest growing language that it's a necessity but the bottom line is do we want to have we'll be we're creating a segregated society by making 

214.38 215.34 B: yeah 

222.86 225.38 A: a second language the norm 

224.77 227.36 B: yeah you're absolutely right 

225.41 226.49 A: i mean 

226.84 228.77 A: i mean it it you know [sigh] 

228.94 243.18 A: it's the bottom english the language you do what our gran- our grandparents great grandparents our father did you learn english first i mean you speak it in the home but the kids you know you you speak only english kids and you know 

236.13 237.11 B: mhm 

241.23 242.57 B: (( mm mhm )) 

243.15 248.73 A: and you know but it's you know back to back to the original topic you know uh 

248.70 259.26 A: you work twice as hard you're behind you work harder you you're depr- you know you work harder you you know whatever your you know as i said you and you could this is a country where there's no 

251.54 252.50 B: mhm 

260.25 267.36 A: well there will always be uh class differences or there'll always be economic deprivation [sigh] 

267.33 274.28 A: uh then you work twice as hard 'cause it's there are some countries where it's an ac- i won't call the law 

269.17 270.16 B: mhm 

274.18 287.24 A: but it's even more cultural i mean the e- so called english class system though that's broken down a little you know there's some countries you know where you know like you know the arab countries where you know women you know 

279.19 280.13 B: mhm 

287.38 290.35 A: [mn] god forbid if you're woman trying to get ahead 

289.90 291.08 B: (( [laughter] yeah i know )) 

290.68 296.27 A: yeah i mean you know you're considered uh all but a dog there so i mean you know 

294.42 300.36 B: [lipsmack] well one of the things i didn't learn until just a few years ago is is that there are certain 

300.34 311.12 B: i guess when you're trying out for certain jobs maybe governmental i'm not sure that um minorities are automatically awarded a certain amount of points and it's like a handicap 

301.10 302.26 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

309.37 321.16 A: in massachu- yeah in massachussetts you're given uh i think it ac- like twenty points same thing yeah if you're of a minority status that's why you always read about people who pur- 

318.09 319.08 B: mhm 

321.32 332.68 A: they won't they'll go any way they can to try and classify themselves as a minority you know they if they're one forty second uh uh zanghesi 

326.53 327.61 B: right 

332.51 333.56 B: [laughter] 

332.80 335.69 A: you know it's all of a sudden they're a minority 

335.04 349.84 B: right and when i when i heard about the way that system works i was i was mortified because i think that [sigh] if two people apply for the same job how how outrageously in the wrong direction it's gone that the minority will get that job and the white person doesn't [sigh] it's the 

348.80 350.22 A: as i said you know 

350.68 360.48 A: there has to come a point i mean you you read about it even further you know i mean you read about people trying to sue to get reparations for slavery i mean there's an extension for [sigh] 

358.15 358.99 B: yeah 

360.30 366.66 A: uh you know for affirmative action you can look at that as almost an extension [sigh] at some point you gotta say okay 

362.34 363.18 B: yeah 

364.14 365.00 B: right 

366.96 380.89 A: you know you've had you've had a leg up now it's time to to you know fish bait or swim and that's w- you know that's spanish you know african american you know uh if someone from another whatever 

370.98 372.22 B: (( [sigh] )) 

372.77 373.81 B: (( mhm )) 

380.44 381.44 B: mhm 

381.09 382.03 A: you know 

382.37 392.81 A: you know you it's time you know you've g- you go to school if you don't go to harvard and you can get into a state school then you get as there and you'll do better that all of someone at harvard getting cs

416.11 428.51 B: pay the rent and and keep everything going [sigh] so what she does is she works a job that requires her to write for a magazine and she has to go to four s- different states [sigh] so she ends up with her kids in the car

437.32 450.43 B: we had very long conversations about [sigh] how she's taking the black attitude and i'm taking the white attitude [sigh] and i i feel that she's just not trying hard enough and that she if she worked more [sigh] or if she took a job she didn't really like 

450.35 454.61 B: [sigh] she would be getting ahead financially but she's not worried about that 

453.26 462.26 A: yeah most of us don't have jobs we like you know i i commute fifty miles and do a job i absolutely loathe but i do it because i have to support a family
