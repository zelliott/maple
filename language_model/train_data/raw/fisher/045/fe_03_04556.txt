0.00 1.01 A: hello 

0.60 2.96 B: hi this is will [noise] 

2.54 4.24 A: this is rob how are you 

4.34 6.32 B: uh i'm good 

5.93 10.70 A: okay affirmative action um hell i'm not even sure what affirmative action is it's something 

10.24 14.42 B: [lipsmack] affirmative action is the policy by which um [lipsmack] 

15.00 29.31 B: uh it's kind of broad term but basically members that are not oh members of ethnic groups [sigh] or maybe socio economic groups [sigh] that are not well represented in the diversity of a certain company [sigh] or any sort of organization 

29.18 35.73 B: are therefore selected for in the the future hirings of that company or uh 

35.99 39.09 B: or applications to the university let's say 

38.88 41.33 A: okay just because of that they're 

39.51 40.39 B: so 

41.53 44.28 B: [sigh] well it the idea is to 

41.59 42.68 A: of a 

42.84 45.46 A: whether they're black or asian or a minority 

44.76 53.88 B: right the idea is to promote diversity uh in various organizations such as universities [sigh] and uh companies 

53.52 62.92 A: right well i don't know about that because i mean i believe and i mean i bust my ass at work and i believe it should be how hard you work at whether you get promoted 

58.76 61.39 B: mhm merit based 

62.55 64.40 B: right 

63.23 67.33 A: it doesn't matter what color you are if you if you earn it then you earn it 

66.85 76.94 B: mhm yeah that's true um i mean and also [sigh] i think there's the problem that most people have is that [noise] i mean it sounds great you know on [laughter] at some level you know like oh you know we're helping 

76.86 87.29 B: out [sigh] whatever but i mean you forget that for you know each person that you help out with that policy you're hurting someone that really deserves to be there [sigh] and uh yeah i definitely 

83.97 85.47 A: (( right especially )) 

85.91 90.73 A: that in everyday jobs are people getting passed over for promotions that deserve it 

89.64 95.28 B: mhm yeah yeah [sigh] um and i think also in the case of universities [sigh] 

95.32 103.46 B: uh you do create kind of a double i mean two levels of pe- of uh you know merit 

103.46 109.85 B: because i mean there is uh [mn] the other the other thing that is kind of assumed is that like [sigh] 

103.47 104.36 A: right 

109.68 111.12 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

110.88 125.83 B: even people of the race that uh you know are selected for uh are kind of well people other people at university or the company might suspect that they don't deserve to be there because they may have been selected for with one of these policies 

125.47 126.57 A: right 

126.00 132.23 B: so i do think that um if the go- if the objective of the policy is to [sigh] 

132.94 140.70 B: uh basically allow for better relations between races and you know en- encourage diversity that's not the right way to do it 

138.87 143.84 A: but it makes people yeah that's not they went about that wrong that's not the right to do it 

140.91 149.65 B: mhm and also i mean in the general population it creates kind of this uneasiness and kind of resentment 

148.03 152.99 A: yeah you've got that barrier there because you know that hey you know this person just got my job 

152.39 154.16 B: (( mhm [noise] mhm yeah )) 

153.23 156.42 A: just because they're black or asian or whatever 

156.06 157.23 B: right 

157.42 159.43 A: yeah i i don't agree with that one 

157.66 159.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

159.48 160.97 B: mhm uh 

159.82 162.82 A: they d- i mean i understand where they come from with it 

162.24 163.99 B: right 

163.23 166.99 A: but they they should have come up with something a little bit different than that 

166.50 179.29 B: well the problem is that i mean as i understand it there was a law case about affirmative action policies in universities [sigh] and the problem with affirmative action is that um 

179.20 186.71 B: the judge that made the ruling on it ruled against it but was extremely vague in their um 

187.26 193.97 B: in their interpretation of the law in the you know 'cause they they write a they write up a h- a um 

189.64 190.74 A: right 

192.12 193.15 A: [cough] 

193.82 206.56 B: a summary of what they decided in the hearing [sigh] and that summary is used for future cases [sigh] and the problem is he was very vague because he didn't want to h- come down against any sort of diversity policy [sigh] and the problem is 

199.43 201.63 A: right and it's too vague 

204.91 211.95 A: well it's a fine line it's a line that don't nobody want to cross you say the wrong thing okay it's gonna come back and bite you later 

206.59 208.97 B: mhm yeah yeah it 

209.35 224.30 B: right right mhm and i mean i think the problem is that because of that vagueness people you know i i mean i think he wanted the his intent was to you know [sigh] not hamper diversity policy [sigh] but um 

224.14 230.04 B: [lipsmack] the problem is that it's allowed affirmative action policies are inherently unfair [sigh] to remain [noise] 

230.17 231.92 B: (( uh active )) 

231.29 235.10 A: right and also people use that to their advantage 

234.94 237.19 B: mhm yeah 

235.87 241.70 A: i mean because see i i mean i've gone to jobs nowadays well not lately but a few years ago 

241.65 253.05 A: and [noise] i mean it it came down to me and a black guy and i'm quite sure he got the job because he was black because he was much younger than me and i had a lot of experience [sigh] 

252.77 254.58 B: mhm 

253.39 256.42 A: i mean so i mean i've experienced that myself 

256.72 264.22 A: [sigh] and at the same time i pretty much thought the same thing you know man that's messed up you know i deserve that and [sigh] he really didn't [sigh] 

259.89 261.58 B: mhm 

264.62 268.26 B: [lipsmack] yep so i'm saying like uh 

268.44 280.12 B: that that's kind of my opinion on it it shouldn't be used for hiring pro- practices um i think that i mean though if the end goal is diversity [sigh] then what you really need to do is i mean 

279.96 286.34 B: [sigh] for one thing it's it's totally irrelevant to i mean i think that it shouldn't be based upon 

286.51 299.84 B: i think the idea that it should be that the reason why people put this policy in place uh this is the reasoning that demographically there are there okay there are demographic groups [sigh] that are not as well represented socio economically 

299.80 300.70 A: right 

299.86 314.64 B: right [sigh] and those groups do not have the same access to higher education [sigh] and so therefore they have to be selected for it [lipsmack] so really then if you do want that policy to be in place you should select for socio economic groups not for racial groups do you see i mean 

312.30 319.19 A: right [sigh] well also at the same time everybody wants to be treated equal well that's not treating equal 

316.22 317.22 B: yeah 

318.54 321.01 B: yeah i know it's not 

320.12 322.29 A: that just that leaves a whole new 

323.10 323.90 B: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

323.50 328.78 A: playground there that's [sigh] uh people of uh the the white race could attack 

329.68 332.53 A: i mean 'cause it's not treating everybody equal [laughter] 

332.37 333.83 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

334.39 335.70 A: yeah that's a 

334.65 338.35 B: i was uh i think we're in agreement here so [laughter] 

337.05 339.86 A: yeah we're definitely in agreement 

338.96 341.17 B: (( so um )) 

342.53 353.04 A: [cough] it's just something that i don't know i th- i think i i agree with you on that that's kind of something that they need to rewrite it make it a little bit different make it not less vague 

346.93 348.20 B: mhm 

353.68 354.43 B: mhm 

354.63 356.43 B: [lipsmack] uh 

359.38 360.28 A: hm 

359.73 361.50 B: yeah [laughter] 

360.54 365.75 A: [laughter] yeah kinda takes a little while don't it [laughter] [sigh] okay uh 

363.94 365.44 B: yeah um 

366.10 372.36 A: has there been any people like politicians that have got where they're at because of affirmative action 

372.95 375.27 A: like that jesse jackson or 

373.13 377.36 B: mm i don't know about that i mean politics is a little bit different because 

377.44 384.68 B: um the reason why affirmative action policies can be in place is because it well it's the result really of 

385.32 386.29 B: hello 

386.81 388.12 B: (( hello all )) 

387.23 388.08 A: yes 

388.07 390.85 B: right [sigh] it's the result really of um 

390.73 393.55 B: you know a very closed selection process 

393.36 405.84 B: like in college admissions and in company hiring there is this private council that kind of decides who will you know be ent- admitted right [sigh] whereas with with politics 

402.43 403.69 A: right 

405.77 413.82 B: um it's more of a public thing you know people vote or a council you know publicly decides and so i mean 

410.84 412.58 A: (( yeah yeah kind of )) 

412.89 414.84 A: just very democratic 

414.31 421.44 B: mm yeah and so it really that couldn't happen you know i mean it really is it's a measure of public opinion rather than anything else 

421.08 425.62 A: can you think of any well known cases just you know to eat up time that uh 

425.83 431.91 A: some affirmative action that has led to somebody getting an important position that 

430.80 435.63 B: uh i mean it's it's it's mostly about ground level hiring policies 

435.45 438.63 B: and um college admissions although i heard of 

438.03 438.60 A: [cough] 

438.43 442.20 B: i don't know any off hand but i know that there were some cases 

441.97 454.16 B: oh and the other problem with affirmative action cases is that i mean it's very hard to prove you know it's hard to say oh they gave this guy a promotion because he's black when you know i mean there are lots of reasons people get promotions you know 

446.79 447.72 A: (( right you've )) 

451.23 453.34 A: got no way of proving that's what it 

453.52 454.67 A: (( yeah )) 

454.05 459.65 B: like maybe he has a very good attendance i mean and you don't realize so it's hard to really point that finger [sigh] um 

458.31 462.20 A: right that's something really is very hard to prove either way 

461.92 471.17 B: mhm [lipsmack] and so i mean people can't really say that and um [lipsmack] that's another reason why it's hard to bring up but um [sigh] i did you know that there is like um [lipsmack] 

472.32 476.71 B: uh there w- a while ago they were saying that um [lipsmack] 

477.44 484.09 B: well yeah i i don't really know any any any statistics about that so i i really can't say anything 

483.86 489.21 A: i believe it's like that in sports of lot of th- there's a lot of affirm- affirmative action in sports nowadays [sigh] 

488.70 491.26 B: you mean for players 

490.87 492.11 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

492.34 494.93 B: mm [sigh] how do you say how so 

494.43 502.16 A: oh there's like coming out of college i mean i've seen people in college that can play basketball just like larry bird [sigh] 

502.50 507.08 A: but they'll get a taller guy who just because he's black 

507.37 510.28 A: and go with him i mean in my opinion 

509.93 512.08 B: well but he's taller though you said 

511.19 515.80 A: [sigh] i mean well yeah but it but it it's still uh the other guy plays better 

515.26 527.83 B: mm i don't think that's true i don't think that'd be true because i mean if there was a better guy out there um they they w- obviously keen to want him i mean i mean if he's i the only sport i really follow is n._b._a. 

527.57 528.48 A: right 

527.81 540.75 B: but i'm saying like with n._b._a. draft you know there are these c- scouts hunting [sigh] and it's like if there was some guy that was good but like you know but uh he he was white i mean i i c- i i still see people really wanting him you know 

540.88 542.21 A: yeah [sigh] 

542.23 544.90 B: i mean i i think that um 

545.63 551.63 B: 'cause i mean the second round in in the second pick in the n._b._a. draft will probably be a white guy 

551.89 555.39 B: darko milicic this guy from [mn] uh eastern europe 

555.40 556.51 A: okay 

556.42 570.61 B: yeah well it depends actually i it it's on a couple of factors um they say that um well grant jays will definitely be the first just 'cause he's the most well known even if people don't need to fill that spot he's easily tradable [sigh] but the second dra- 

570.41 575.58 B: uh second take will either be darko milicic or connell anthony i don't know if you follow ncaa 

575.16 578.73 A: (( no i follow football [laughter] )) 

576.12 577.21 B: oh it c- 

578.08 585.41 B: oh okay okay actually uh [mn] you know syracuse won the ncaa tournament right this year 

584.32 585.28 A: right 

585.36 599.89 B: and one of their players connell anthony is this big star he plays uh what's it [sigh] small forward no no no he plays uh shooting guard sorry or point guard he plays point guard [sigh] and darko milicic plays small forward [sigh] so really
