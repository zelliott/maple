36.94 42.56 B: it seems like and it could be that just public schools are so overcrowded now that 

43.00 48.25 B: um [sigh] maybe the teachers are so over most to the 

48.37 54.36 B: the students don't get the one on one attention that they should and and maybe the schools are so large that they don't

135.09 135.97 A: well 

136.07 138.27 A: where i'm at 

138.70 140.17 A: it seems 

140.44 144.80 A: to be a pretty good school system 

144.20 145.13 B: uh-huh 

145.50 146.61 A: um 

147.70 151.98 A: the clovis unified school district is is 

152.04 157.45 A: highly recommended they are very sports minded 

157.03 158.78 B: right 

157.96 159.71 A: but um 

160.77 169.45 A: [lipsmack] academically i think i think they're doing pretty well um i have a junior high student 

165.18 166.26 B: uh-huh 

169.89 171.02 A: and 

171.21 180.04 A: she's excelling in in math to a degree i i never obtained even in high school 

179.48 187.23 B: right that's the way it seems with my nieces it seems like they learning stuff um a lot younger than than i did 

180.11 181.68 A: [laughter] and 

187.77 190.45 A: so i you know i i 

190.82 194.64 A: think all in all the public school system has 

194.85 197.78 A: ah improved over time 

196.13 197.32 B: uh-huh 

198.37 199.75 A: um 

201.61 202.96 A: but 

203.22 205.54 A: i'd almost need to 

207.29 209.01 A: [mn] talk to the 

209.79 216.02 A: [laughter] talk to the administration where she's at t- to get a 

209.84 210.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

212.27 214.19 B: (( right )) 

216.47 222.42 A: clear you know to be a little more educated in that area i think their student um 

219.31 221.18 B: right 

222.66 225.83 A: limit is thirty per class 

225.17 226.11 B: (( is it it's )) 

226.57 229.88 A: and so it's not it's not too bad 

229.29 231.38 B: (( not too bad )) 

231.57 232.55 B: um 

231.59 233.49 A: but you you think that 

233.73 237.02 A: they don't get enough one on one time 

236.67 245.26 B: well it just seems that whenever i was in school that um [sigh] maybe you you knew everybody the classes were 

245.55 247.52 B: um smaller 

248.02 253.88 B: ah now it's you know i i went to my niece's school in near and 

254.41 261.82 B: ah she was real young i'm not sure what grade she's in third or something but they were already switching classes you know 

261.89 264.45 B: from one teacher to another right 

262.18 263.43 A: oh gosh 

263.57 266.13 A: like like they don't have a home room 

265.76 271.61 B: right well they did like maybe half a day and then they went to other teachers' classes for the other half a day 

267.17 268.43 A: that's young 

271.36 284.40 A: and a see that's how m- that's how the junior high or the intermediate school works here they have a b. classes in the morning or the afternoon 

278.13 279.30 B: right 

283.97 284.94 B: (( mhm right )) 

284.48 285.86 A: d- depending on 

285.98 287.30 A: (( [lipsmack] on what )) 

288.11 297.85 A: [noise] unit they're in in school but um then the other three or four classes are different teachers but those initial [noise] um 

294.37 296.88 B: (( mhm right )) 

298.55 303.92 A: mandatory classes a- are with the same teacher 

300.65 302.02 B: (( right mhm )) 

304.52 309.35 A: so if they're doing it in the third grade that's really early because 

308.63 312.78 B: it is um i guess um overall i'm really pleased with the way 

313.30 315.54 B: um my nieces are 

315.95 324.38 B: getting their education but i did know of a lady who's son and or yeah her son and her daughter both 

324.70 327.21 B: they were in remedial classes they didn't 

327.57 337.34 B: i don't think ah her boy did it i don't think either one of them could read probably over a third grade level ah and they both received a diploma though 

337.98 340.77 A: [noise] oh that's not good [laughter] 

339.86 347.35 B: (( that's not good i don't know how how they passed i don't i guess maybe they get to a certain point where they thought well okay )) 

347.39 349.76 B: as long as you know this or 

350.35 356.36 B: whatever then they would pass them that's what they did they both received their diploma just like everybody else 

354.39 361.18 A: well you've hi- you've hit on one topic that that does bother me um 

361.39 364.47 A: when i am correcting 

364.67 366.51 A: the the written 

367.83 369.14 A: work 

369.47 377.41 A: i see a lot of um mistakes a lot of punctuation and spelling mistakes but some of that 

372.04 372.94 B: uh-huh 

374.87 376.60 B: right 

377.80 384.89 A: is due to how how quickly she's getting her homework done and not n- 

383.42 385.74 B: right i understand 

385.17 387.90 A: but at the same time 

388.77 391.14 A: [cough] i'm trying to get her 

391.17 397.15 A: and i and i don't think i'm getting a lot of teacher support in that area i'm trying to get her to do it right 

397.08 407.16 A: even when she's writing quickly because when she gets to college they're not going to accept it they're they're they're just n- not going to go for it at all 

403.01 405.29 B: [noise] right exactly 

407.18 417.63 A: and it bothers me that they're not on top of it and it makes me the bad guy because i'm always pointing it out and i i want to be real positive 

415.19 416.48 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

417.82 419.19 A: and yet 

419.65 425.09 A: i- i can't i can't be real positive when there are all these mistakes and i'm thinking 

425.32 430.25 A: oh college is right around the corner and this isn't going to work [cough] 

428.96 430.07 B: right 

430.73 432.16 B: (( so you are a teacher )) 

432.68 442.00 A: no i'm n- i'm not a teacher [laughter] um but ah it's one area that i am good at 

433.96 435.13 B: oh okay 

441.37 442.31 B: (( is that okay )) 

442.87 444.39 A: and um 

444.66 449.85 A: and so that i guess bothers me and yet she's excellent 

450.29 451.66 A: (( at math )) 

452.11 453.30 A: and 

453.32 455.05 A: she's excelling 

455.43 461.52 A: um in that area and i i didn't so [cough] 

461.84 468.22 A: they're doing i- they're doing something right and although it may be it may be just a difference in 

468.26 469.13 A: (( um )) 

469.29 474.45 A: how the brain works usually if you're a good reader and speller and 

469.40 471.17 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

474.26 476.05 B: right 

474.74 480.83 A: all of the language portion if you have that down then you're not as good at math 

480.59 482.36 B: right 

481.50 484.64 A: at least that's what i've been told [laughter] 

484.46 485.56 B: [laughter] 

486.49 493.42 A: so um but all in all i think the public school system where where i'm located 

493.96 495.60 A: [mn] is pretty 

496.02 499.23 A: pretty good and pretty structured and 

499.24 500.23 A: um 

501.57 502.86 A: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

503.21 508.79 A: i don't know i can't think of anything else bad [laughter] ah any improving 

505.94 507.64 B: [laughter] 

509.18 510.70 A: maybe 

510.76 511.93 A: um 

510.97 512.46 B: maybe security 

512.48 514.75 A: yeah maybe secur- well they're 

513.78 515.25 B: (( right [noise] )) 

515.66 520.34 A: they're pretty good around here on a security of i- of their 

520.58 521.59 A: um 

523.12 529.77 A: students and like they don't they don't go they can't they're not allowed to leave on the lunch hour and 

529.06 532.47 B: right not even in high school 

530.13 531.12 A: um 

532.52 535.91 A: um i don't know about in high school 

536.19 539.03 A: i really don't know i only know about the 

539.08 541.53 A: junior high right now and she's going 

539.88 540.86 B: uh-huh

543.21 544.12 B: right 

545.40 546.42 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

547.00 549.47 A: i just i i don't know 

550.24 557.14 A: but they did send letters home assuring us that everything is secure ever since nine eleven 

556.93 559.23 B: (( right )) 

557.52 565.28 A: and um that they have plans in place and i did go to the 

565.29 568.02 A: school one day and they had um 

568.69 573.99 A: an unplanned drill and everything was al- all the kids were really 

574.32 583.23 A: you they you could see all the energy in the air that something different had happened for the day and so they were all talking and because it wa- had just ended
