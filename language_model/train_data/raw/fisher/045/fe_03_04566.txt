0.00 0.63 A: (( [noise] )) 

0.42 1.71 B: hello 

0.87 1.72 A: (( hello )) 

1.88 6.26 B: yeah hi i'm robert and i'm uh in brooklyn new york city 

5.66 8.54 A: [sigh] high i'm bryan i'm in chester new jersey 

8.44 14.35 B: oh okay the topic of the day is movies [sigh] um do you want me to start 

13.71 15.64 A: [sigh] sure [noise] [noise] [noise] 

14.95 22.11 B: um [sigh] well i see a lot of movies but i tend to see them either on television them or i occasionally rent tapes 

16.07 16.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

22.08 32.86 B: i only go to a theatre uh [sigh] three or four times a year at most it's usually for a film that i'm very anxious to see and that doesn't happen really very often 

27.18 28.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

32.74 34.70 A: [noise] oh yeah i know [sigh] 

35.14 43.50 A: same here uh i usually like since the movie theatre prices are so expensive now [sigh] i'd rather just like rent movies and everything 

42.92 56.71 B: yeah that's that's somew- somewhat true for me also [sigh] if i go into manhattan it's ten bucks for a movie and even here in the neighborhood in brooklyn it's about eight fifty well i can rent i can rent a movie for five days 

52.67 54.23 A: yeah same here 

56.83 62.53 B: for a maximum of three dollars eighty eight cents if it's an old movie it's only a dollar ninety nine 

62.29 63.72 A: [noise] same here 

62.59 64.33 B: so it's a terrific bargain 

64.38 68.66 A: definitely it definitely is what was the last movie you've seen 

68.36 69.75 B: what's that 

69.23 71.17 A: what was the last movie you saw 

70.49 74.79 B: oh i was [laughter] i wasn't working uh yesterday afternoon 

74.57 86.02 B: [sigh] so i was tuning around o- on television i just happened to catch this film [sigh] uncle vanya on forty second street made about seven years ago [sigh] i suspect you haven't seen it 

85.46 86.62 A: no 

86.07 100.58 B: and you may not be interested because it's a rather unusual movie but i rather liked it [sigh] i have a tendency i i about two months ago i signed up for digital cable prior to that i just had regular cable do you happen to have digital cable 

99.85 102.91 A: uh-huh um no i have regular cable 

102.24 108.69 B: okay when you get digital cable [sigh] you have added to your [mn] station list 

104.09 105.43 A: (( [noise] )) 

109.19 122.17 B: about twenty five channels that show nothing but movies and the interesting about it is that [sigh] these stations show movies without commercial interruptions which is what i prefer 

120.05 120.91 A: [noise] 

122.19 123.55 B: (( [sigh] 'cause )) 

122.52 126.68 A: uh yeah i know definitely i i had prefer that too 

123.92 124.93 B: (( y- so )) 

126.33 137.36 B: so whenever i have some time on my hands and i want to mo- watch a movie the first thing i do is i check uh check out the digital stations to see if there might be anything on that uh 

135.19 135.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

137.13 143.51 B: that i might be interested in [sigh] and then if there's nothing there i'll either go to to the movies or perhaps rent a tape 

142.87 146.37 A: yeah definitely [noise] 

145.68 147.68 B: do you watch uh 

148.19 153.10 B: the movies on regular cable wh- where they have commercial interruptions 

152.93 157.10 A: yeah sometimes i do yeah if if i really enjoy the movie 

156.43 157.89 B: it doesn't bother you 

157.82 162.75 A: no it d- it does but i can see through it 

162.07 169.91 B: okay see the other problem is that i find that in stations where they have commercial interruptions i strongly suspect the movie's been cut also 

169.57 172.69 A: oh yes de- i can definitely see that 

171.46 174.35 B: 'cause you can see where it's kind of disjointed 

173.83 176.15 A: (( yeah )) 

174.71 181.19 B: [sigh] so that's a pretty terrible way to watch a movie i think i mean i do it occasionally but it's you know i hate it 

177.94 179.11 A: yeah 

180.78 185.59 A: oh yeah i i i dislike that they cut some good scenes and things like that too 

185.91 195.86 A: it's pretty ba- i don't like i don't like that part i mean at the most time whenever i watch a movie like that it's always one that i've seen full length before so 

195.23 197.88 B: right have you seen chicago 

198.16 201.94 A: yes i have i yeah i really did did you 

199.20 200.70 B: did you like it 

202.01 210.23 B: oh i that's a film i'll go to a theatre for i haven't seen it yet but it's still playing in a few theaters [sigh] so i'll probably see it within the next week or so 

209.85 215.35 A: oh yeah i def- i would definitely recommend that that is a really really good movie 

214.37 216.42 B: i heard the uh 

216.57 224.31 B: the cast album of the broadway show which is quite good i didn't hear i didn't h- hear any part of the movie soundtrack though 

220.37 221.65 A: no i i haven't 

224.11 234.49 A: [sigh] no the the mo- the movie soundtrack's pretty good i i haven't seen chicago like in the actual like on broadway but i would really like to see it there 

234.30 238.99 B: as far as i know it's still playing it's been playing for like two or three years 

236.93 237.91 A: (( excellent )) 

239.02 244.55 A: yeah actually i'm i'm thinking of going pretty soon [noise] to see it 

243.70 248.80 B: [sigh] the problem with that is that if you pay full price it's like a hundred dollars or close to it 

248.29 250.74 A: oh i know [sigh] i know 

250.42 257.87 B: but what i do occasionally if i want to see a show is i try the [sigh] the two for two ticket booth on broadway 

257.85 262.20 A: yes yes where it's like uh like reduced price tickets and 

261.52 267.34 B: yeah exactly so occasionally i've lucked out and i've got [mn] a show at fifty percent off 

262.91 263.82 A: yeah 

267.24 272.35 A: yeah that's definitely nice i've done that in uh a couple of times 

271.68 274.25 B: have you ever paid full price for a show 

274.46 276.59 A: uh yes i have 

275.89 277.49 B: like what was that 

276.96 278.94 A: (( uh to see aida )) 

278.79 281.54 B: oh right right right was that a hundred dollars 

281.44 286.87 A: it well it came out to um how much was it it came out to eighty eight dollars 

286.59 288.16 B: was it worth it 

287.64 291.71 A: yes i i really enjoyed that 

291.52 293.98 B: is that the one at the new amsterdam 

294.49 296.27 A: um i 

295.03 297.95 B: no i guess not the lion king's at the new amsterdam 

297.15 300.54 A: yeah the lion yes the lion king's at the new amsterdam 

300.13 304.28 B: [sigh] you're talking about the one where the music is written by um 

304.53 307.79 B: what's his name that famous rock singer and composer 

307.43 313.25 A: [noise] yes um oh r- reece not not reece um 

311.50 317.71 B: no no the fellow's been around for like twenty five years already but he's still famous but that it yeah 

314.36 315.35 A: (( yes )) 

315.85 321.49 A: yeah it it it it's right on my tip of my tongue i just [laughter] can't remember it 

320.90 326.11 B: yeah i see him on television occasionally and i used to listen to a lot of his records years ago 

326.00 338.89 B: [sigh] but you're right i g- we know who it is it's a goodish singer who's very popular and ahs has later been writing shows and movies in any case i heard a few of the songs from that show on the radio [sigh] and they seemed okay 

329.28 330.39 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

333.03 334.03 A: yeah 

338.47 341.69 A: yeah i i it kept me interested 

341.24 343.00 B: did you see the lion king 

342.61 347.49 A: [sigh] no i haven't seen that yet i want to though have you seen it 

345.93 355.08 B: yeah [sigh] i haven't seen it yet that might be a show that you can get uh the uh reduced tickets to i suspect [sigh] 'cause it's been playing for like four years already 

352.74 354.71 A: oh yeah 

355.20 362.99 A: yeah true um do you get a chance to see uh [sigh] oh what was it rocky horror picture show 

363.03 364.56 B: do you mean the movie 

363.42 366.99 A: before it closed down the no the uh on broad- 

365.76 367.10 B: oh the show 

367.68 371.36 B: [sigh] no was that on broadway or off broadway i don't remember 

369.87 378.24 A: yeah um it c- it i i had i saw it the sec- the day before it closed i got tickets 

377.58 379.16 B: and you liked it 

378.87 385.23 A: oh yes i really wish it was still on i really do it was it was like wonderful 

384.58 387.35 B: then you must uh have liked the film 

387.36 388.78 A: yeah i did i 

387.51 389.46 B: or didn't you see it yeah 

388.82 394.91 A: i liked the film i actually have the film [noise] yep i have the tape 

392.11 393.68 B: oh you mean you have the tape 

395.29 396.70 A: of it 

396.11 405.70 B: yeah i never saw it it used to play all the time on weekends at a couple of theaters in manhattan [sigh] it was playing like for years [sigh] but i never did get to see it 

401.71 402.68 A: (( yeah )) 

405.73 408.74 A: it was it was really good i liked it a lot 

408.44 412.42 B: i don't know if it's ever on television i've never noticed it on television 

412.08 415.98 A: i have a couple of times like around uh halloween 

416.43 422.15 A: it was it's kinda it's on like v._h. one sometimes 

416.69 418.73 B: oh yeah that makes sense 

421.02 423.77 B: and that must have been the first movie with [mn] 

424.05 426.45 B: which in which susan sarandon 

426.76 428.67 B: starred as i recall 

426.76 427.83 A: yeah i 

428.11 431.12 A: yep she she was the one that starred in it 

430.47 434.39 B: yes so she must have been like uh twenty years old at the time or something 

433.86 436.73 A: yeah she w- she looked really young in it 

436.24 437.81 B: is that a musical 

437.73 438.74 A: yes 

438.48 443.08 B: oh okay [sigh] 'cause i originally though that it was basically a regular 

443.17 446.58 B: horror horror film not not a musical film 

446.06 459.80 A: that's what i thought at first too but then it it was a musical but it i i liked it from when i first saw it and so i just sort of went and i s- i wanted to see it on broadway before it closed 

459.13 464.38 B: so if you saw the if so if you have the tape you must have watched it uh multiple times 

463.98 467.81 A: (( yep i ha- )) 

466.72 469.37 B: do you rent do you rent tapes at the store 

469.59 471.95 A: um sometimes yes 

471.87 479.87 B: oh because i generally rent it really doesn't make sense for me [sigh] to buy because i rarely want to see a film more than maybe once 

479.78 482.73 A: uh yes but um i mean like 

482.58 482.92 A: (( [sigh] )) 

482.90 486.89 A: my whole family is like into musicals and everything and uh 

486.87 501.49 A: and they live like we live at like a bunch of different like towns like around around like where i live and so uh so they all of them really like wanted to see it and i saw it on s- on sale actually for a really good price 

492.71 493.61 B: yeah 

501.34 505.28 A: so i bought it and i let them borrow it borrow it instead of having them 

503.84 508.66 B: oh all right so in others you buy a tape and many different people see it at different times 

508.09 509.38 A: yes 

508.76 519.59 B: yes so then i guess it may make sense [sigh] in my in my tape store [sigh] once a tape's been around the store for a while they usually sell it out for sometimes as low as as ten bucks 

511.02 512.26 A: yeah 

519.91 520.81 A: yeah 

519.94 524.40 B: but matter of fact occasionally they'll have a special where it's as low as like three for twenty 

524.06 527.59 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

526.38 534.52 B: so that's a pretty good deal i guess but no i rare- i but nevertheless the uh the last time i bought i tape i don't even remember it's at least two or three years ago 

528.34 529.42 A: (( that's )) 

536.82 539.42 B: what was that [noise] are you there 

539.77 540.62 B: oh 

542.28 546.03 B: i guess we've been cut off or we have ten minutes hello 

546.69 547.49 B: (( oh )) 

550.70 551.70 B: hello 

558.82 559.97 B: (( hello [noise] )) 

578.97 580.19 B: (( hello [noise] )) 

580.90 596.67 A: (( the thing yeah [noise] ))
