5.05 5.84 A: (( good )) 

6.12 7.62 B: all right 

7.92 9.92 B: (( um now what do we do )) 

9.81 17.51 A: [laughter] you just basically talk about the ah the the topic so ah do you ah do you think that sports ah 

17.73 21.64 A: ah sports ah athletes ah should be paid as much as they do 

21.92 23.73 B: ah well i mean 

22.02 22.87 A: they are 

24.03 32.84 B: up to a certain extent it's they're like entertainers so like if we pay like movie stars and other people like that you know bil- millions of dollars why not them 

32.67 34.09 A: yeah 

33.51 37.52 B: so but like for them to go on strike i think it's a little ridiculous 

37.68 39.46 A: yeah no no totally 

39.42 40.49 B: yeah 

40.04 46.54 A: i mean i i guess that when they go on i mean ninety nine million dollars what's that that was just offered to ah 

46.77 48.12 A: to jason kidd 

47.88 48.86 B: yeah 

48.37 55.29 A: [laughter] and ah he ah well i i guess he's not going on strike so it really doesn't matter in that regard but ah 

55.49 59.24 A: yeah i don't know i guess some people have a big problem with it 

58.72 65.40 B: yeah well i mean think about it like arod's making twenty five million dollars a year and that's like winning the lottery for like ten years straight 

65.39 66.57 A: yeah 

65.97 73.79 B: so when you think about it like that it's pretty ridiculous and then they're complaining i i don't know what their complaints are they have all the money in the world i i don't know 

74.36 78.43 B: is it because they're greedy and want more um yeah it's 

74.46 75.02 A: (( do )) 

76.25 77.71 A: you think they're greedy 

78.66 81.03 A: it could be i'm not i'm not disagreeing with you 

80.39 81.44 B: possible 

81.92 87.85 B: [cough] yeah i think it's also a culture thing like because you always want more money i guess that's how the culture is built 

89.54 95.40 A: yeah no that's true that's true hey i mean i guess if you're you're spoilt and you're making tons of money why not 

94.85 98.29 B: yeah well like lots of athletes come from ah i guess 

98.85 100.46 B: they just don't have a lot 

101.29 106.05 B: like basketball players lots are more inner city guys i mean occasionally you come across ah 

106.37 113.85 B: someone who's just had like every advantage and you know someone like alan hewson who was like a coach's son and someone who worked in the system 

113.64 114.72 A: yeah 

114.12 115.88 B: but then you have other people 

115.91 122.06 B: ah i guess like a- alan iverson who's just from the street you know and everything he's always taught is you know 

122.38 126.29 B: that money's great money does this for you and all that other stuff 

127.22 129.59 A: so what yeah yeah i guess i mean 

130.14 144.50 A: i mean like okay if if if if they're going to make it over the ah the people like i mean if george steinbruner is gong to make the money because his team's doing well as opposed to ah one of his players i'd rather see it go to the players the talent instead of ah 

144.45 146.96 A: instead of the executives behind the ah 

147.02 158.99 A: you know behind the curtain who basically ah control everything i mean i can un- that's what i can i mean when you see big movie stars and stuff making money i mean it doesn't really bother me if the s- you know if they're making it over the studios 

158.67 160.19 B: yeah yeah that's true 

158.84 167.23 A: i like it to that you know what i mean like it i guess it's kind of greedy when they decide to strike because you think of like the fan quotient and how much the fans ah 

167.35 178.47 A: you know if if they're like basically not going to be able to see their team play as well as they could because the person leaves but i guess it's it's not as ah it's not all that simple to just blame them for for doing it 

178.77 189.07 A: i mean i don't know i mean if i was making that much money and i was in that sort of mindset where i was making tons of money and ah and i felt that i was getting screwed i guess it's a i guess it's a case by case basis i don't know 

188.73 190.46 B: well i mean definitely i mean 

190.49 197.35 B: like an owner like george steinbruner compared to like mark cubin um you know you know the dallas guy 

194.44 195.72 A: mhm 

196.96 198.39 A: right 

197.77 204.61 B: yeah i i would have no trouble with him making more money 'cause i just feel like he'd invested into the team whereas george steinbruner 

205.45 213.68 B: ah i guess it'd just go in his pocket or just for him to win more champion- i don't i don't i just don't like how steinbruner spends his money 

213.14 216.21 A: yeah yeah yeah are you are you a new yorker 

216.02 217.23 B: yes i am 

216.90 218.39 A: where in new york 

217.85 219.21 B: um brooklyn 

219.00 221.36 A: yeah i'm in brooklyn too that's funny [laughter] 

220.65 221.52 B: yeah 

221.90 224.07 A: but ah yeah are you mets or yankees 

223.76 225.78 B: i'm a mets fan myself 

224.90 226.98 A: (( oh okay there you go [laughter] then )) 

226.82 228.34 B: (( yeah )) 

227.45 229.70 A: (( you really hate steinbruner [laughter] )) 

229.10 231.31 B: yeah i i really hate him but 

231.68 237.21 B: at the same point like you know i think he um he got rid of his plan a couple of years ago 

236.68 238.48 A: i didn't know that yeah 

237.68 240.58 B: yeah that was one of his ways of ah 

240.95 245.37 B: i guess cutting costs like it paid derek ninety million dollars a year or something like that 

244.27 246.94 A: yeah see that's ridiculous yeah 

246.25 247.28 B: mhm 

247.08 249.72 A: yeah that's that's that's really ridiculous 

249.37 258.51 B: yeah i think the mets did something similar though i don't remember it off the top of my head 'cause i remember something like may to december the day before the mets 

259.02 260.23 A: yeah 

259.63 260.98 B: (( yeah )) 

260.40 263.70 A: what's the um ho- how are the mets doing this year actually 

263.69 267.26 B: ah i believe they might still be in last place 

266.90 268.03 A: oh really 

267.71 271.42 B: yeah but they they're rebuilding so they're trading everybody so they're trading 

270.21 275.68 A: and and what's his name is is ah what's him name playing um piazza is he playing or is he hurt 

275.08 280.56 B: [cough] ah he's still hurt i mean they're saying that he might be back i guess late august 

279.96 280.86 A: okay 

280.93 282.35 B: but i'm not sure 

281.91 283.33 A: how do you feel about him 

284.09 287.41 B: um what do you mean in general or 

286.64 289.31 A: yeah in general do you like the guy or i mean he 

288.50 291.54 B: yeah i mean i think he's a good player he plays hard 

290.44 292.19 A: (( is he is a good player )) 

291.84 296.67 B: yeah he catches a bad rap for not having a great arm but he still calls a great game 

296.27 297.99 A: yeah 

296.99 303.11 B: and the mets won with him as ca- you know they got to world series with him as a catcher so i don't see what the problem is 

303.14 308.50 A: yeah no i just know that like people have conflicting views of him who live in the city you know i mean 

308.66 316.63 A: i i'm not a big m- mets fans so i really don't you know one way or the other but i know that some people ah don't like him and some people do and i know that he is a good player though 

316.73 319.11 B: yeah he's a great player i think 

318.82 321.92 A: yeah what about what about college ah 

322.64 326.31 A: what about um college players getting money [laughter] 

326.91 331.29 B: well i mean in a perfect world i mean you go to school to learn 

331.83 333.94 B: so i mean it really shouldn't be an issue 

333.86 335.35 A: right 

335.03 336.97 B: but at the same time um 

337.33 339.73 B: you know i've been a student myself and i know 

339.99 341.40 B: ah having money 

341.43 350.90 B: coming in is pretty hard just to work on a side and be an athlete becomes a top priority for them so i mean i guess if they can get ah some type of stipend it would be good 

345.62 346.54 A: right 

350.67 352.11 A: yeah 

351.55 354.81 B: i mean just just so that you can get by just for food and other 

354.93 356.21 B: things like that 

356.17 357.02 A: yeah 

356.34 367.69 B: but i mean ge- getting like a salary or you know or a schol- or a scholarship's ending up being who gives them the most money or who gives them the most pocket cash that that isn't the right way to go about it 

367.49 369.59 A: who gives them some gifts and stuff 

369.23 370.25 B: yeah 

370.26 374.54 A: yeah 'cause i know that some of them get like you know even though it's illegal that some of them get stuff 

374.75 375.93 B: oh definitely 

376.08 378.92 A: have you done ah have you done this ah survey before 

378.65 379.82 B: no i haven't 

379.49 383.31 A: it's the first time [laughter] yeah keep looking at your watch 

380.56 381.45 B: yeah 

383.88 384.86 B: what happened 

384.55 386.35 A: do you keep looking at your watch 

386.39 387.46 B: yeah 

386.88 391.17 A: [laughter] yeah i know where did you find out about it 

390.58 392.49 B: i just saw it today on the internet 

392.30 393.80 A: on the craig's list 

393.87 395.29 B: yeah craig's list 

394.84 396.68 A: that's funny yeah 

396.08 397.09 B: yeah 

396.77 398.46 A: why not 

398.85 403.00 A: but ah okay we got three minutes to talk about sports still so ah 

402.58 403.56 B: okay 

403.17 405.39 A: are you jets or giants 

404.45 405.01 B: (( [cough] )) 

405.96 407.20 B: (( ah giants )) 

407.34 408.63 A: yeah 

408.04 412.34 B: unfortunately yeah that one i just can't stop i don't know 

412.16 416.31 A: the ah the jersey giants or new york giants [laughter] 

415.73 418.38 B: ah i'm going to call them new york [laughter] 

417.67 421.36 A: yeah [laughter] yeah why not 

418.41 419.30 B: yeah 

420.77 424.03 B: collins collins is i think he's a terrible quarterback but 

425.21 430.25 B: [cough] that's just my opinion other than that i think they have a pretty solid team now that they got rid of seahorn 

430.03 433.32 A: mhm right right how about hockey 

431.28 432.10 B: yeah 

433.53 436.95 B: i mean i'm not much of a hockey fan i don't really know much about it 

437.13 439.06 A: yeah how about basketball 

439.11 442.51 B: ah basketball i used to be a bigger fan than now but 

442.81 446.27 B: i've been reading up on it lately so i've been following it a little more 

446.97 453.04 A: yeah i i don't know i think ah i like the mets but ah just as a home team but you know when are they going to win 

454.52 458.00 B: well once they can get rid of some of these the salary they have 

457.97 461.13 A: exactly as long as they don't go on strike [laughter] 

460.55 462.06 B: yeah [laughter] 

462.22 468.77 A: you know and i mean the mets i i i don't know i root for them just because they were just so they were doing so poorly for so long 

468.68 472.25 B: yeah i think other than that i couldn't care less if they win or lose 

472.12 482.30 A: right and i guess another thing with striking i mean if if that's their only option i mean i can sort of understand it but i mean like you get a lot of these ah athletes that are 

482.65 483.94 A: that are um 

484.63 487.71 A: (( ah what do you call it they get endorsements like crazy you know )) 

487.38 488.58 B: yeah 

487.98 494.51 A: so it's like i mean i can almost i i don't know i mean maybe it's their only option and they they're worth more you know 

494.63 502.94 A: i mean it's sort of america just to sort of you know free enterprise in terms of ah i'd be trying to get as much money as i can get you know i don't know 

502.82 508.46 B: i mean i i do understand that the business side of it that you know because 

506.59 507.82 A: right 

509.06 511.91 B: but the fact that they're making so much money kind of bothers me 

511.96 521.04 A: yeah it bothers me too i mean it's sort of like because it's like ah you know what are they doing with that money i mean they're you know they're for what they're they're extremely lucky and what about ah 

520.87 522.47 B: yeah i mean yeah 

521.06 527.49 A: what about all the people that are suffering i mean if they did if they did stuff with it plus you know i think they have a responsibility to the fans you know 

527.53 529.06 B: (( yeah )) 

527.72 541.42 A: but yeah yeah you're right i mean you watch like a football team like the jets and you got ah you got these people making millions of dollars a year and then you get these third string people like running backs and stuff who are barely able to play and they're making like the minimum you know and that kind of sucks 

541.09 543.52 B: (( yeah yeah no that does suck )) 

544.35 549.94 B: [cough] i mean like i was like um i went to college and i'm not i'm not making a lot of money 

549.44 551.13 A: yeah tell me about it [laughter] 

550.89 555.57 B: no i mean the entry level is what twenty eight thirty thousand dollars a year 

556.22 564.81 B: and meanwhile you have these guys are just making so much money and they have the nerve to complain about it it that that's what irks me at times 

564.25 566.03 A: yeah no totally 

567.29 568.12 B: so 

567.74 570.87 A: you know they they complain about it go on strike and then ah 

571.63 577.81 A: the team and then fans just basically ah you know can't can't can't see what they're they're paying for and what they support it's 

577.60 578.63 B: (( no i )) 

578.36 583.23 A: one of the you know one of the reasons why they're so popular half the time is because it's the fans that like them 

583.12 591.57 B: that's true and at the same time every time they ask for more salary we're the ones who pay for it it goes in the ticket prices it goes in concessions 

589.46 590.81 A: yeah that's right 

591.38 593.68 A: concessions ticket prices 

593.51 596.01 B: ah all that so 

596.47 599.89 B: (( i just think the fans like they're the ones who end up hurting ))
