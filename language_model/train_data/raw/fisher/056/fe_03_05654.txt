20.91 22.42 A: about two weeks 

23.00 28.96 B: oh um we're supposed to talk about airport security to going through with the airport so um 

28.98 31.47 B: what questions do you have concerning the airport security 

31.70 34.14 A: do you think that um 

35.12 39.23 A: with the heightened airport security do you think it's going 

39.36 44.03 A: [noise] to make it harder for terrorists to attack us using the airways 

44.95 52.87 B: (( yeah i think it will make it a lot tougher 'cause like [noise] there's more restrictions now 'cause like um )) 

53.16 56.62 B: (( when i used to go in the airport like they used to um they )) 

56.72 58.46 B: (( you know more like um they )) 

58.73 72.31 B: stopped me more like when i went to florida last year [noise] even like pulled me to like the side and like take me they made me take off my shoes they made me like whatever beat them they made in check in but they 

72.80 77.91 B: (( like with all technology like even though like there's um )) 

78.73 82.94 B: (( you you still a person still can go through it once they take [noise] )) 

83.19 87.95 A: yeah i had the same thing happen to me whenever we flew through ah 

88.23 98.96 A: fort worth texas they pulled me to the side and they searched me took my baggage and ah looked through the baggage made sure i was okay mhm 

98.59 105.37 B: but do you think like you feel more comfortable to it's better for you one day like they stopped you and they didn't check you 

105.85 106.98 B: better 

107.39 110.06 A: yeah i i feel a little bit safer um 

110.19 111.30 A: i mean 

112.34 114.74 B: (( yeah 'cause like they still have um )) 

115.78 125.01 B: like undressed um security officers or police people that are that are trained for that so it is is a little bit safer 

121.43 122.55 A: yeah 

126.08 132.30 B: [noise] so what do you think what what what what do you think is the flaws 

132.31 133.78 A: is the fall 

133.86 137.92 B: like what what flaws do you think in airport security 

138.01 139.28 A: um 

145.02 147.66 A: probably with the drivers licence ah 

145.29 146.16 B: hello 

148.04 154.96 A: i really can't answer your question too well but ah the drivers licence the airport terrorists that you know 

155.03 166.46 A: were in control during nine eleven they all had fake ah drivers licence from i believe florida and i guess they should check that more in depth 

166.81 178.05 B: (( oh yeah i understand i understand i didn't see like that here um but do you think like maybe like security like when a person is coming to um )) 

178.11 182.11 B: (( to get the tic- like to give them the tickets and everything )) 

181.50 184.93 A: yeah i think they should add more security yeah you know 

185.38 187.74 B: (( but you know like um )) 

185.52 186.28 A: more 

188.11 189.80 B: (( that's like a budget [noise] problems too )) 

191.87 193.02 A: (( what do you mean )) 

193.67 196.58 B: like you have to spend more money on that 

196.54 198.14 A: yeah yeah 

197.98 203.91 B: and like um and the and we the taxpayers we we pay for that 

202.99 215.89 A: yeah but like right after nine eleven happened you you saw how the airport or not the airports but the airlines themselves were ah you know in some really bad money trouble because nobody 

206.33 208.38 B: yeah 

216.01 219.19 A: nobody thought it was safe to travel you 

219.63 230.53 A: know where i'm i'm the type of person where you know i'm not going to live in fear i i'll still travel even you know with the risks it's just there are a lot of people that 

230.74 236.01 A: if they don't feel that it's the least bit safe they won't do it 

236.71 240.55 B: yeah i understand like i think i think it's safe 

240.61 250.42 B: but i think they'd be stood up but like i don't know like i think like where do you live now like 

242.17 243.10 A: uh-huh 

249.22 250.71 A: indiana 

250.54 256.08 B: oh indiana so where was you when nine eleven happened 

251.50 252.77 A: yeah 

254.85 258.86 A: i was in ah i was actually still in high school when that happened 

259.60 262.89 B: oh that and that's in indiana 

261.73 262.94 A: yeah 

262.93 265.52 B: oh like like me i was 

265.88 280.46 B: i stayed i was in new york i live in i live in new york and i seen like i seen like on t._v. how that happened and i i went through the world trade centre to see have a look so i seen it as the situation has occurred there 

269.16 270.21 A: oh 

281.87 286.89 B: and i seen the one on t._v. like on the second plane crash i seen that on 

286.48 287.85 A: mhm 

287.38 295.29 B: like it was scary like when i went there you see all the buildings the big building just crumpled on the floor just flat 

294.71 297.24 A: did you actually see it fall 

297.17 303.27 B: on t._v. yeah yeah on t._v. both of them 

298.52 299.65 A: you did 

301.80 306.53 A: mm i watched 'em on t._v. but i was all the way over here 

306.75 309.54 B: (( yeah like my father was actually near it )) 

310.09 312.53 B: and like and smoke that came off 

312.95 320.94 B: my father had to cross the bridge hold on i'm [laughter] there's a there's a insect down near me sorry 

320.31 321.81 A: (( that's all right )) 

321.66 325.64 B: yeah um yeah my father had to cross the um the brooklyn bridge 

325.81 326.74 B: um 

327.09 330.08 B: he had like he came home late that day 

331.29 333.73 B: so it was pretty it was pretty sad 

333.65 335.39 A: yeah 

335.60 338.31 B: (( so what else do you have what other questions do you have )) 

340.05 343.68 A: do you feel that it's safe to travel right now on an airplane 

344.90 354.21 B: yeah 'cause i believe like they give the government are giving the funding that finally they are giving them 'cause remember you said like you said those in a crisis 

354.33 355.65 B: (( those like )) 

355.88 361.79 B: (( some airlines are going bankrupt and they was really really needing government help )) 

361.73 362.75 A: right 

362.19 365.39 B: so i think that we have seen enough money um 

365.52 366.94 B: some i 

366.96 370.62 B: i think the small okay the smaller companies 

370.80 375.07 B: i think they are i think they are messed up 

375.20 376.87 A: why do you say that 

378.02 379.12 B: because um 

382.00 386.42 B: (( like do you not have that the legal companies )) 

388.22 392.58 B: (( because not not that much people going on smaller they are going on bigger air companies )) 

392.15 400.93 A: mm yeah and something else about that is you know to do with money the smaller companies have to charge a higher price 

401.44 403.47 A: you know to to make their 

403.46 409.89 A: um to make their profit whereas a bigger company can take a a small hit every once in a while 

409.70 420.89 A: you know with coupons or something whereas a smaller company probably cannot you know they can't afford it they don't have as much money to fall back on to as delta 

421.11 423.86 B: yes that's right so i think they'll 

424.03 427.34 B: they'll they'll they get the hit the hardest 

426.30 427.62 A: yeah 

427.61 428.57 B: (( 'cause )) 

429.48 439.84 B: on the smaller companies like oh you know so they need check on too remember remember you said drivers licence and everything 'cause remember you said like um they learn they they 

440.02 448.71 B: (( they learn how to fly planes to like driving school like how to fly airplanes in the little schools airplane schools i don't see how you can get tough on those )) 

445.33 446.16 A: yeah 

449.29 449.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

449.77 450.57 A: yeah 

449.94 453.91 B: make make a whole background check and and 

453.95 458.53 B: everything more stricter and you can like have oh just let them go through 

458.53 460.21 A: yeah 

460.94 462.92 A: yeah you're right with that um 

464.49 468.91 A: that should really be toughened up right there in that area 

469.69 471.83 A: where they are actually being trained to fly 

472.68 477.70 B: (( [noise] yes so i i think they should be tougher on that makes sure they should be tougher on that )) 

477.14 482.31 A: now what do you think about these software programmes for like computers that teach you how to fly planes 

484.02 485.82 B: i don't know like 

486.23 488.26 B: um hold on like 

489.04 490.58 B: (( let me see um let )) 

491.37 494.80 B: (( me think about it well if it's the )) 

496.74 498.09 A: (( the what )) 

497.76 500.54 B: technology time is good 

499.47 507.06 A: yeah but do you feel that having software like that out on the market is pretty safe 

507.27 509.15 B: yeah 

508.57 510.69 A: (( you think that's all right )) 

509.78 510.94 B: (( out of my hands )) 

512.68 514.56 A: have you um 

514.83 517.58 A: played one of those simulations 

517.50 518.35 B: what 

518.85 520.39 A: do what 

520.11 521.37 B: (( i'm sorry what did you say )) 

521.23 523.72 A: have you played one of the simulations 

523.70 526.86 B: (( no i i only did um bus simulations )) 

528.57 530.44 B: (( that's it )) 

530.85 531.78 B: have you 

531.94 535.70 A: oh yeah i actually have one of the flight simulators 

535.44 537.41 B: how is it 

537.41 538.36 A: (( well )) 

539.61 544.64 A: it's not the easiest thing i'll i'll tell you that actually you 

544.66 550.02 A: know it actually teaches you every little thing about every little thing 

550.36 553.05 A: of the aircraft um 

553.50 560.13 A: to you get a really good knowledge on how to take off how to land it and how to turn and bank it 

553.74 554.52 B: uh-huh 

560.21 561.15 A: and 

560.57 561.14 B: (( yeah ))

562.32 565.22 B: how many how many times you did that 

564.66 566.50 A: how many times have i played it 

565.91 567.79 B: yeah 

566.51 569.37 A: oh i'd say a good nine or ten 

569.64 572.88 B: (( you think like you know from that you know how to fly an airplane )) 

573.76 577.03 A: no no um i know 

577.09 578.68 A: how to control it 

577.33 580.74 B: like the like the base like the basics like that 

579.91 581.96 A: yeah yeah the basics 

582.39 583.63 A: (( um )) 

584.27 586.25 A: i know how to do the basics 

587.68 594.93 B: (( well i never did anything you should be in the right hands i think that's another stricter policy which they have like )) 

594.97 599.89 B: (( aeroplanes people should have like like the airport the industry ))
