0.00 2.13 B: hi i'm tony 

1.74 4.43 A: [mn] hi i'm adam how ya doin' 

4.56 7.94 B: i'm all right did you hear what the quest- the the topic was 

8.00 16.33 A: yeah airport security like does um basically do you think that it the raising of airport security improves safety 

16.21 18.19 B: [sigh] [sigh] yeah 

17.27 18.50 A: that's what i heard 

18.50 19.81 B: (( all right )) 

19.84 22.62 A: [noise] yeah so we gotta talk about this um 

23.02 30.51 A: well i don't know um for starters i guess it does but it has a lot of problems attached right 

23.62 24.49 B: [mn] 

30.84 32.75 B: [mn] a problem with what 

32.95 37.96 A: it certainly does improve security but i mean it's not without its problems 

38.40 39.29 A: you know 

38.44 48.76 B: for sure i mean i hear all the time about like you know how uh something gets through or you know like it 

48.69 61.87 B: you know there there are flaws in it and i mean uh [sigh] you know it's uh i guess it's one of those cost things you can put uh only so much money and get so much benefit from it [cough] 

61.60 69.78 A: yeah yeah it's true i mean better to have it than not to have it but i guess it's not a a total fix it's not a total solution 

68.18 68.96 B: (( mhm )) 

70.16 78.15 B: [mn] right i think that uh i think israel has like the best record as far as airport security goes 

70.92 71.81 A: (( you know )) 

77.54 82.68 A: that's what i heard yeah i guess they they've had a long history of having to take it very seriously 

79.05 79.82 B: (( [mn] )) 

81.76 82.49 B: yeah 

82.84 85.76 A: you know when i was a kid sorry go on 

83.13 84.95 B: but they use racial mm 

85.88 87.64 B: (( go ahead go ahead )) 

88.06 95.01 A: uh when i was a kid we we my parents flew backwards and forwards a lot from new zealand to england and um 

95.05 100.61 A: you know the security then was a lot tighter than it than it is was until recently you know 

100.61 104.44 A: like since two thousand and one obviously things have got very tight but 

104.35 117.85 A: in the last fifteen or twenty years it got more and more relaxed i can remember when they wouldn't allow certain toys i had 'cause they were made of metal and things like that and and they they screened you a lot more than they have in the last decade or so you know 

117.92 118.70 B: (( uh-huh right )) 

118.14 122.28 A: so i think you know it's only a case of like getting back to sort of more and more 

122.49 123.39 A: (( you know )) 

123.42 134.02 A: consciousness of it i mean in the seventies there was all the hijackings if you remember i don't know if you remember that but it it was more [laughter] but it was kind of a that was the issue at the time you know 

129.37 130.51 B: ah not really [noise] 

134.51 138.18 A: so i guess they had a reason for being aware of it internationally 

138.24 141.07 A: but these days you know people have got more and more 

141.38 144.47 A: cushioned haven't they so they don't worry about things so much 

145.32 148.74 B: [mn] right i don't know i don't i personally i don't know if 

148.81 152.61 B: you can successfully hijack a plane anymore 

152.92 154.35 B: because of 

153.35 155.26 A: yeah yeah 

154.61 158.08 B: because of what happened on the one plane during nine eleven 

158.25 159.15 A: (( mm )) 

158.27 162.26 B: where the uh the passengers decided to rebel 

162.47 163.72 A: yeah 

163.34 164.31 B: you know 

163.70 174.45 A: yeah that now the fact that it's known that's a good point the fact that it's just known that this wa- was something that happened and known by everyone pretty much um makes it a lot harder to pull off 

174.40 180.22 A: yeah just that in itself is actually a a difference in uh the security [mn] 

174.94 176.08 B: i mean the 

179.23 183.37 B: i mean the minute someone ta- takes a knife out on board a plane 

183.68 186.49 B: they're going to get mobbed [laughter] 

185.59 189.12 A: yeah totally i mean i i've often thought that you know um 

189.07 203.73 A: i wear a lot of punk jewellery and they have long spikes that a friend of mine makes i mean they're really sharp and they're totally deadly looking but i'm not remotely violent you know what i mean i just have these and and they obviously they i can't even go in the post office near where i work because they scan and i 

197.07 197.89 B: right 

203.59 206.40 A: you know i just take them off before i go in you know 

206.36 207.14 B: right 

206.50 221.18 A: but i mean i wouldn't be allowed them on a plane but i tell you what i mean a you know there's a lot of people that would would you know be pretty deadly if if they [laughter] you know saw something like this happen because everyone's going to go crazy just like you said you know [mn] 

221.38 235.95 A: i just they just crossed my mind that it's funny that they basically leave me sort of without what is technically a weapon even though i wouldn't use it you know what i mean and in that situation i would go crazy you know if and i would absolutely leap on some guy you know yeah 

235.62 239.69 B: right i mean you know if the choice is 

239.81 248.42 B: you know let them take the airplane and run into a building or something or you know or get cut with a little knife 'cause they're not going to have a huge knife 

242.85 244.08 A: [laughter] 

246.61 248.12 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

248.37 249.28 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

248.63 251.99 B: you know you you got your choices set out for ya 

251.65 261.29 A: yeah i think like you say the the awareness of it the knowledge of that that's what somebody has already done you know and this is what is actually happening for real right now 

257.95 258.68 B: (( mhm )) 

261.14 272.50 A: um that does change things because i mean there's the terrible thing with that situation is seeing somebody with a knife to their throat or something at the front of the plane most people don't want to see that person get hurt but 

272.38 278.91 A: if you know that if you let this situation go on for another ten minutes you're all dead it's very different isn't it 

272.40 273.18 B: right 

278.64 282.45 B: you're all dead and you know you could be killing other people 

282.37 284.07 A: yeah yeah yeah 

283.45 284.38 B: (( you know )) 

284.50 299.11 A: yeah it's funny i mean i a lot i'm actually very patient with them when i travel i don't travel internationally much but i mean if i do it's like yeah yeah you gotta do it you know i mean some people are cool about it and some people are assholes about it the security guys you know 

294.35 295.18 B: right 

298.99 310.00 B: right from what i hear the reason why israel is as successful as they are is 'cause they use racial profiling you're from an area that promotes terrorisms 

310.05 316.00 B: they uh interview you and you know they do strip searches and the and the and the like 

312.74 313.98 A: (( [mn] [mn] yeah )) 

316.13 323.84 A: yeah i think that yeah i mean that's something that sort of vilified here as being not politically correct and and it is certainly 

316.67 318.08 B: (( and uh that might not )) 

324.07 329.51 A: fraught with problems you know it you know it's not a good thing necessarily racial profiling but 

329.49 343.02 A: um that's true that is that has been part of their success but another thing that's been part of their success is they're trained better they're more they're raised to take it much more seriously you know i mean we have a pretty laid back attitude here 

339.31 341.14 B: sure and i think that 

343.02 348.18 B: don't you if you're if you're born there you have to be part of the military is that at some point 

348.04 349.39 A: yeah i think so 

348.39 356.51 B: for a little while and you know that gives them probably you know slightly better training before they go and get a job at the airport 

349.45 350.33 A: yeah 

356.38 357.24 A: (( mm )) 

357.16 362.51 B: you know whereas the people in the united states you know are getting paid who knows what an hour 

357.38 358.30 A: yeah 

362.71 366.85 B: are you know they're just literally guys off the street 

367.02 367.88 A: (( mm )) 

368.02 370.24 B: you know who just want to get paid 

368.32 368.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

370.28 372.61 A: yeah totally yeah 

370.59 373.58 B: and have no training or relatively none 

373.83 382.69 A: i think people here are are are less interested in international news generally and um that makes a difference too you know because um 

378.30 379.10 B: uh-huh 

382.70 394.46 A: it makes it harder to really sort of know how to to treat and and understand people that are not like you you know in in for a situation if for instance somebody working as a secur- airport security guard you know 

389.44 390.22 B: right 

394.70 404.15 A: as people like in other countries like in israel or in europe um european countries they're just more sort of conditioned to what's going on outside so you know 

404.61 410.83 A: they understand a little bit more of the people that they're encountering in an international environment like an airport you know 

410.83 414.31 B: that's probably the case you know we have we live our 

414.32 417.72 B: own little sheltered lives here in the u._s. and uh 

418.11 422.16 B: you know mo- i think some of us acknowledge that [laughter] so 

421.39 430.02 A: yeah yeah and it's a sad thing because it it's a sad thing to have to say because it's such a good society here that it it ought to be able to do that if it wants you know 

422.24 422.87 B: (( so )) 

429.72 430.50 B: (( right [mn] )) 

430.42 436.34 A: it's sad [mn] yeah um it's funny actually like the difference between um 

436.37 446.32 A: airport security i mean prior to nine eleven the uh around the states compared to internationally because my parents traveled a lot when i was a kid so i i've been 

446.11 459.02 A: exposed to a lot of that you know international flights and so i'm used to that much more than the incredibly laid back national flights you know which is like getting on a bus you know i mean there's almost no security or was 

453.98 454.81 B: right 

456.59 457.64 B: pretty much 

458.88 466.02 A: and that's all had to be changed but i mean i can remember thinking many times like you know ten years ago five years ago that um 

466.79 473.66 A: they really ought to have a bit more security you know locally you know within the states it's still a a plane for christ sake you know 

470.20 471.01 B: uh-huh 

472.77 473.69 B: i took 

473.88 475.41 B: i took a plane to 

474.05 476.55 A: even though it's local you know [laughter] 

476.32 480.06 B: i took a plane to seattle like four or five years ago 

480.28 483.42 B: and i left my ticket at home 

483.61 484.54 A: uh-huh 

483.79 486.08 B: but my name was on their list 

486.08 487.65 A: yeah 

487.09 494.19 B: and they let me on like just no just accepting the fact okay well you don't have a ticket but that's all right 

493.71 496.42 A: did they make you see did you show them i._d. 

496.23 497.61 B: (( yeah yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

496.94 501.68 A: yeah yeah yeah it's a strange thing yeah i mean 

501.67 512.13 A: um there are so many ways to you know i guess that's what they're finding now and they're probably improving it step by step but there's so many ways to get around the security things i mean 

511.93 520.63 A: in the sense of like obviously these terrorists had like american probably probably had american drivers' licenses and i mean i know some of them they cert- some of them went to school here 

519.78 522.04 B: they had american pilots' licenses 

521.75 524.71 A: oh really i'm not quite that up on the news yeah 

522.24 530.66 B: [laughter] [laughter] they took they uh they definitely did go for training they learned to fly but not to land 

527.92 528.78 A: (( mm )) 

530.19 531.32 A: yeah 

530.72 533.00 B: and you'd think that would have keyed them off 

533.12 534.08 A: yeah 

533.31 536.95 B: like no we don't need to learn how to land we just want to know how to fly 

535.33 536.84 A: (( yeah [laughter] 'cause that like a )) 

536.90 543.14 A: (( warning signal you know like how how come you want to be a pilot but you don't want to learn how to land [laughter] )) 

542.72 543.54 B: (( [mn] [noise] uh-huh )) 

543.98 546.25 A: yeah that's a bit that's black humor huh 

546.58 548.65 A: [mn] yeah well 

548.71 550.32 A: (( [lipsmack] i don't know what else to say )) 

550.44 551.45 A: (( um )) 

551.73 562.44 A: [lipsmack] a friend oh i thought of something um i have a friend who's a um documentary film maker and he he has lots of friends that are cameramen and things like that and and uh 

560.94 561.73 B: right 

562.21 567.53 A: the the there was everybody's got these stories of um security guys at the airport 

567.50 577.28 A: mishandling their equipment like you know thirty thousand dollars worth of camera that's about a foot and a half long it just looks like a camera but this has has to be handled in a certain way it's got 

570.84 571.67 B: sure 

574.72 575.54 B: right 

576.64 577.44 B: uh-huh 

577.31 587.99 A: you know it has to be balanced and things like that you can't tip it on its end all kinds of weird shit like that um and they're just grabbing hold of this thing and trying to pull bits off of it like you know 

582.82 584.01 B: right 

588.38 599.89 A: like uh you know monkeys' tea party you know what i mean 'cause they're just not trained in how to use it and and some people are saying well if you're going to have this security we're we're all for it too you know but you're going to have to have people that 

591.63 592.51 B: right
