1.55 2.76 B: hello 

2.46 4.15 A: (( hey what's up )) 

4.27 6.45 B: hi i'm jeff from texas 

5.51 6.76 A: hi i'm robert 

7.12 8.34 B: how are you doing 

8.20 10.66 A: pretty good where are you coming from 

9.86 10.98 B: texas 

10.97 13.51 A: oh okay i'm calling from um michigan 

13.93 15.29 B: okay cool 

16.55 20.81 B: so uh what do you think about the war in the middle east 

21.57 27.11 A: well i i don't know what to think about it i mean a lot of the stuff with it seems kind of 

29.44 34.90 A: mixed you know mixed up that it even happened the way that they did it ah 

35.99 41.94 A: you know i think there's a lot of stuff going on that maybe we don't totally know about about that you know 

42.42 53.14 A: as to as to what's going on so it makes it hard to really have a good opinion of what what they're doing ah you know what the u._s. is doing i guess you know 

53.39 59.16 B: yeah i really get the the feeling that there's a lot [cough] 

59.55 62.41 B: a lot going on that they're not telling us about 

63.28 69.03 B: like uh like they were just like they've been talking about recently um 

69.63 75.18 B: they haven't been able to find the weapons of mass destruction like they've been talking about that's 

75.03 77.53 A: yeah that's true they ah 

77.66 86.71 A: they haven't done that now one of my friends in the in the military like reserves you know she's like a dentist or whatever she was talking about how 

86.80 91.40 A: some of stuff she's seen like when she was in even in puerto rico and other places 

91.19 101.42 A: is in a part of the u._s. but but it's just ah she wonders if some of the even conspiracy type stuff is true in her mind and ah 

101.29 110.52 A: that was kind of surprising to me that you know she would feel that way about it but that that she would feel that way with some potential credibility to some of the really extreme stuff even 

110.62 120.98 A: (( yeah )) 

114.57 115.36 B: pretty 

115.79 119.12 B: [cough] i think that um 

119.69 127.23 B: the u._s. wouldn't be wouldn't even be involved if they didn't have if it wasn't for nine eleven 

129.20 133.29 A: i i i think so i i would say that probably that that's 

133.39 137.75 A: a big thing although you i've heard those theories that some of the people 

137.57 152.04 A: in the administration that are directing the war have wanted to have some kind of excuse to remake the middle east even without nine eleven that they were pushing for stuff like this but i think probably that may have given them more 

152.07 164.72 A: you know credibility within the rest of the administration to say oh yeah let's do this now whereas maybe if they'd tried it before nine eleven people would have said well it's not worth the effort or whatever it's not worth all the all the stuff we have to do to try to do this 

165.21 171.95 B: yeah wouldn't have had any support really at all because in afghanistan there's 

172.10 173.08 B: been 

173.66 178.27 B: stuff going on for twenty years and the united states 

178.73 181.76 B: didn't feel like they needed to do anything about it 

181.75 184.57 A: (( oh yeah that that was a big ah )) 

184.62 194.08 A: [mn] i mean nobody's ever been able to control afghanistan ah one of my teachers was there she married ah someone from that country and converted to islam and everything and ah 

194.47 201.46 A: she was there when the russians moved in and she i remember she taught a class in high school about islam and all that and she was saying how that they ah 

201.56 209.70 A: ah except for th- the capital city that it it's been ah you know no one's ever controlled that that country except the local people 

213.09 216.70 B: yeah definitely 'cause it's scary there 

216.99 219.45 A: yeah yeah kind of weird 

220.42 231.58 A: you know no one seemed to care too much about the whole issue until recently anyway i mean it was ju- it was just kind of floating out there 

231.75 233.42 B: (( yeah )) 

232.00 232.89 A: and they're 

235.24 236.06 B: (( say what )) 

235.25 237.81 A: and you know there's been a big impact here 'cause you know detroit has 

237.82 250.91 A: like probably the biggest moslem population outside the middle east and everything and a lot of people are people that left iraq because of hussein you know a lot of them are christians and stuff that moved over here and a lot of them more recently are 

250.78 253.58 A: not it's sort of a mixture but it's like ah 

253.85 256.40 A: you know there's a a 

256.48 258.29 A: lot of ah 

258.34 267.13 A: lot of issues with that a and then there's a lot of things too i mean it was funny that one of the politicians here that the democr- you know pretty much a liberal democrat has ah 

268.27 270.48 A: (( has gotten has pushed um )) 

270.41 285.09 A: all these demo- all the arab democrats to vote for bush last time 'cause of they didn't like lieberman and they were seen to be like kind of anti jewish or anti semitic kind of thing with that [mn] that you know he was jewish too extreme and this and that so they had to vote for bush and everything it was kind of weird you know 

285.10 286.68 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

285.39 299.97 A: and his his public was really there i mean he's like uh 'cause he works for the he's like a civil rights attorney and everything else he's a democrat he is a democrat but i mean because of the who was running on the ticket he thought it was more important uh to break ah 

300.77 305.15 A: you know to break the thing and and go for bush back then kind of kind of weird 

307.58 309.91 B: yeah that is that is strange huh 

310.32 316.26 A: yeah and it was all lieberman 'cause i i saw the quote you know where he was in the paper and everything about him 

318.37 323.96 A: (( so that was pretty weird so you're from texas originally oh okay cool )) 

321.21 322.20 B: yes 

327.50 332.35 B: and you live in in detroit itself or the suburbs 

331.25 337.22 A: i live yeah i live two blocks from detroit the city i live in a like a township that's 

334.51 335.51 B: oh okay 

337.40 345.16 A: unincorporated next to it ah but i'm right on the border like i can see it i walk down a block of my street and i'm right there on the border with detroit 

345.68 346.87 B: oh okay 

347.15 355.17 A: you know i like um i like detroit it's ah a lot of people here don't like it even i mean it's just kind of kind of what you 

355.64 360.83 A: you know what you like or what you know uh it's better than what people think but it's like ah 

361.60 365.65 A: clearly the whole you know racial thing 

366.23 375.14 A: [mn] just destroyed so much of what was going on in detroit ah [mn] along with th- the auto industry kind of went downhill i mean it was ah 

375.03 382.69 A: you know back up till around nineteen sixty detroit was like the l._a. of you know ten or twenty years ago it was one of it was probably the richest city in america and uh 

382.63 394.54 A: sort of the trend setter in a lot of stuff but then it just sort of fell back you know and gone downhill but i i like it it's it's interesting i mean it's interesting all these y- you know rappers 

388.02 389.29 B: yeah 

394.45 400.75 A: (( musicians that are coming out of detroit it's kind of there's something here that seems to do it but )) 

401.58 405.93 A: it's different are you living in a small big city or a small town there or 

404.90 406.56 B: (( hm um )) 

406.69 408.91 B: in dallas kind of 

408.22 409.35 A: (( oh okay ))

411.71 412.68 A: (( oh okay )) 

412.94 417.37 A: (( fort worth seems like kind of cooler i mean it seems like sort of just )) 

417.32 427.02 A: like until recently economy wise i mean it's not big like detroit it never went down to the depths but it seems like fort worth has like more of the stuff 

426.79 433.22 A: from the past of fort worth preserved in it you know and i do think fort worth from what i know of it 

433.36 438.56 A: was a a bigger influence and a bigger city say a hundred years ago 

438.68 449.44 A: compared to like now you know dallas and the whole dallas thing it's sort of you know sort of like minneapolis st paul is like that too nobody ever really thinks of st paul but a hundred years ago they were pretty even you know 

440.66 441.89 B: yeah 

446.94 447.90 B: yeah 

449.71 454.52 B: um nowadays it's pretty much just a really big suburb of dallas [laughter] 

454.81 460.78 B: but but back in the days of like th- the cattle drives and so on [mn] 

459.00 463.95 A: mhm yeah i've seen some of the little you know like ah 

464.20 476.68 A: ah buildings and stuff from say eighty or a hundred years ago that are kind of cool that sort of limestone or brick or not brick but stone or some kind of construction and everything it looked kind of interesting yeah some 

477.20 483.44 A: (( of that stuff that's left over from then is kind of cool and detroit has i mean detroit's the last thing that [mn] have you ever been here )) 

483.17 484.92 B: no i haven't 

484.31 493.54 A: it's like the downtown with a couple of exceptions are all buildings like built from like the twenties a- and earlier so it's like it looks like you're going back in 

493.43 494.28 A: (( like the bat- )) 

494.20 495.86 A: you know like it looks like the city batman 

495.78 503.76 A: would be in or something you know 'cause all the buildings are these gothic kind of skyscrapers from eighty years when there were very few other ones to mess up the view or anything 

500.13 501.23 B: [laughter] 

503.68 513.82 A: i- i- it's it's interesting biggest trouble is most of them are like not well a lot of them are are vacant you know they're totally boarded up and everything which is kind of interesting 

504.68 505.50 B: (( hm )) 

513.67 515.11 B: yeah 

515.21 516.62 A: (( you know there )) 

517.25 526.25 A: for a while but now there's a unless you're right downtown a large number of them are just totally empty which is really bizarre when you go down there and visit you 

526.30 529.22 B: yeah that that is because 

528.04 542.40 A: know and and we got canada five minutes away which is interesting this is an interesting you know place in some ways uh i was in dallas one time it was [mn] i used to work for that e._e._s. for a little while and they had us go to plano and everything so that was kind of a 

542.34 543.75 B: [laughter] 

543.67 554.00 A: i didn't i didn't get to do much i was working all the time but it you know it seemed like it was certainly dallas was growing a lot that was the you know that that seems to be what a lot of people 

554.75 560.10 A: like in the city i mean i'm sure it's good for jobs and everything 'cause there's ah houses were just going up everywhere back 

560.47 562.02 B: yeah it's
