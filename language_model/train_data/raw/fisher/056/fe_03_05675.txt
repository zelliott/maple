46.41 52.18 B: do you ah do you have any ah personal stake in it i mean are you ah

54.22 55.83 B: how's that

66.10 67.20 A: and how about you 

67.90 76.30 B: um well i i only follow it in the newspapers you know i i did ah study ah political science in college 

76.68 77.95 B: um 

79.37 81.08 A: so you're a lawyer or a 

81.52 85.82 B: no i'm a an unemployed office worker at this point 

84.92 85.96 A: okay 

86.80 88.34 A: well that won't be forever 

88.00 89.66 B: yeah 

89.82 91.11 B: um 

90.98 94.94 A: do you think the middle east policy is going to help your your situation 

95.08 96.43 B: uh 

96.46 99.85 B: no not not particularly um 

100.45 102.18 B: i do think 

102.19 104.13 B: that uh 

105.68 109.81 B: you know although there's always going to be violence in the world that uh 

109.95 116.27 B: you know things certainly aren't going to ah get better until there's some kind of a you know 

116.59 120.17 B: uh something worked out over there 

118.87 119.67 A: (( mm )) 

120.36 127.50 B: ah that and i don't think it can really be up to either side at this point you know i think 

127.76 130.51 B: they've talked about sending a u._n. ah 

130.82 134.10 B: u._n. troops in to kind of police the uh 

134.30 138.28 B: you know areas of unrest i i think that's the only thing that would really 

138.38 141.74 B: settle things down a little bit you know 

141.07 141.91 A: (( mm )) 

142.52 145.05 A: yeah but those are going to be our troops and british troops 

145.77 146.97 B: well it's 

146.24 147.55 A: for the most part 

147.69 152.38 B: ah well not necessarily if if it was like a u._n. ah 

152.59 158.09 B: resolution it would be a lot of different european ah troops as well as like other ah 

159.05 161.88 B: countries from the region um 

162.07 163.37 A: but not france 

164.21 170.09 B: no i think ah this is something that they would that they would back as far as i know 

170.25 171.28 B: um 

171.82 173.36 B: 'cause they've ah 

174.96 185.18 B: long been pretty active in the region and you know it's not like iraq where they didn't want us going in there but i think they [sigh] they do have a lot of ah 

185.16 190.00 B: interest there they have a lot of muslims in france uh itself so 

187.80 188.65 A: mhm 

190.02 196.93 B: i think there would be a lot of pressure on them to actually you know participate a lot 'cause 

196.77 206.49 B: it's the palestinians that want the the you know multinational ah troops to come in 'cause they are tired of the israelis um 

206.56 210.45 B: being the only ah people policing them you know 

211.00 214.67 B: ah so i think they would respond better if it was ah 

215.11 219.64 B: troops from other countries like that would come in and be a little bit more 

220.46 222.29 B: even handed with it you know 

222.28 224.29 A: people that don't know the area at all 

224.61 226.80 B: yeah i guess so um 

226.79 229.13 A: that don't know the language don't know the culture 

229.22 231.53 B: well that's what's going on in iraq 

229.34 231.72 A: don't know the location 

231.76 234.45 B: that's what happened in iraq you know they 

234.25 235.87 A: right that didn't work 

235.98 238.93 B: well it's not working but uh 

238.09 238.88 A: no 

239.49 241.39 B: uh i think it was ah 

242.21 248.09 B: a questionable premise to go in in the first place to iraq i think ah 

248.95 252.03 B: you know it it wasn't really ah 

252.98 254.32 B: welcomed 

254.35 261.11 B: you know by the people like we thought it would be you know whereas this y- you know and they're trying to control the whole country 

261.23 270.89 B: it's the size of california what not and the area's in the middle east you know and and israel would be a lot smaller that they would have to ah 

271.14 272.52 B: be working with 

274.26 275.22 B: (( 'cause then )) 

274.41 276.30 A: then of course we pay for that too 

277.66 281.09 B: ah well we probably pick up a good portion of it i guess 

281.89 286.53 B: s- sounds like you're you're against the idea what do you think would would help over there 

286.53 288.62 A: i think if we minded our own business 

288.47 289.35 B: really 

291.28 293.41 A: because this is getting us 

293.43 297.38 A: spread thin in areas that we have no knowledge obviously 

297.31 299.27 B: right 

298.49 300.57 A: it's obvious that the president is 

301.69 306.07 A: giving speeches based on information that may or may not be correct 

306.06 307.42 B: right 

307.48 311.35 A: and it's whatever is politically expedient for him to say rather than the truth 

311.14 313.07 B: right 

312.84 316.69 A: so we're not getting the ah the actual truth from anybody 

316.74 320.91 B: uh-huh well i believe that [laughter] um 

322.12 329.35 B: yeah you know i i think i agree with you in in principle i i think you know we should be more um 

331.04 332.95 B: for- focussed on 

333.09 335.81 B: our own country and the problems we have here 

335.59 342.79 A: well he's taken care of it very well you know he's he's cut the taxes for the most wealthy in the country he's taking away 

342.70 350.78 A: as much as he can from everybody else he's going to destroy the health insurance system uh he's working on dismantling medicare 

347.47 348.53 B: yeah 

350.83 351.88 B: right 

351.26 353.76 A: um raising taxes 

353.89 358.14 A: ah on the state and local level which compensate for the 

355.82 357.02 B: right 

358.21 360.15 A: ah federal tax cuts 

360.32 363.97 A: i mean he's doing he's doing everything for this for the people i 

363.19 364.84 B: (( mhm )) 

365.97 367.79 B: [laughter] 

367.04 367.99 A: mean 

368.18 374.40 A: you'll you'll see that he it's he's dismantling more and more social service programs 

374.40 375.36 B: uh-huh 

375.00 378.28 A: uh because he doesn't have to pay for them personally 

377.13 377.96 B: right 

379.15 381.68 A: and his friends don't don't have a need for them 

381.59 383.47 B: right 

383.78 384.66 B: (( ah )) 

384.35 387.86 A: and he's now cut overtime or they're they're working on that 

386.86 391.03 B: i know i can't ah i found that pretty hard to believe 

391.03 393.23 A: and nobody is saying anything 

392.77 402.81 B: that's a little puzzling to me why are people not ah i mean i've seen a couple of things in the paper but i mean how is this getting passed i don't understand that 

402.19 404.54 A: well the same way we're in the middle east 

405.54 407.28 A: and nobody is saying anything 

409.38 411.28 A: and the numbers keep getting worse 

410.99 412.37 B: yeah 

411.78 413.64 A: the casualties get worse 

415.57 418.40 A: the dollars and cents get worse the prognosis is 

418.48 419.70 A: undecided 

421.78 423.22 A: the war hasn't ended it 

426.58 428.19 A: really hasn't ended over there 

427.97 429.66 B: no not at all 

428.98 429.70 A: no 

430.58 432.92 B: uh it's not going to any time soon 

434.16 435.14 B: um 

437.35 440.10 B: yeah i you know it's just ah 

442.52 451.00 B: it may not be the way you and i would ah choose to do things i think i it sounds like you were against going to war in iraq and i certainly was too 

450.65 454.03 A: well just because this guy went after his father is not a reason 

454.39 458.07 A: to to take the whole country against uh against someone 

458.50 461.42 B: well you know if they if they impeached ah 

461.49 464.30 B: clinton over ah lying about uh 

464.85 467.01 B: you know his escapades 

466.54 470.44 A: right which had nothing to do with the operation of the country 

467.26 468.70 B: [laughter] how 

469.03 470.01 B: how 

470.19 475.21 B: i mean what bush has done already is ah a hundred times as impeachable you know 

474.77 475.59 A: true 

475.23 477.33 B: (( presenting misleading ah i )) 

477.83 481.36 B: mean sending us to a war on false pretenses and ah 

481.00 483.61 A: well he showed us the evidence supposedly 

484.01 495.71 B: yeah but it was [mn] forgeries and and ah half truths and and ah just they spun everything and left everything out that that you know wasn't 

495.81 497.63 B: wouldn't benefit their case 

497.20 499.49 A: i don't know if they spun it or they just 

499.87 502.49 A: didn't present it mm 

502.87 508.62 B: yeah well either way you know i mean a lie is can be an omission of the truth as opposed just to a f- 

508.77 510.54 B: flat out lie 

510.77 511.93 B: (( and ah )) 

512.88 516.34 B: you know if i was the parents of a 

516.47 519.76 B: someone that was killed over there or

520.99 521.91 A: mhm 

523.98 526.37 B: i wo- i would be pretty outraged you know 

528.37 530.29 B: especially considering ah he 

530.54 536.06 B: you know he does these flyovers you know on to the aircraft aircraft carriers and uh 

536.21 541.10 B: all the evidence shows that he did everything he could to avoid serving in vietnam you know 

540.79 541.58 A: (( mm )) 

541.85 544.86 A: well that's going to be a good picture for the reelection campaign 

544.83 546.07 B: yeah 

545.47 548.97 A: you know than showing how much is happening in the middle east 

548.40 549.32 B: uh-huh
