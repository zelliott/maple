0.00 0.55 B: reuben 

0.65 1.75 A: keith 

1.74 3.68 B: hey keith how you doing 

3.05 4.40 A: pretty good how are you 

4.15 10.89 B: good thanks i guess we're supposed to to discuss ah airport security do you travel much 

5.44 6.48 A: so 

11.12 18.25 A: um i travel a little bit i used to travel a bit more in the past i don't do it as much now what about yourself 

15.90 16.83 B: uh-huh 

18.00 25.19 B: uh i do do like to travel my wife and i enjoy travelling um at least twice a year 

25.25 26.09 A: right 

25.32 36.15 B: ah for vacation ah she used to travel more on business and stuff but not any more so we do travel so uh do you think ah the high end s- it ah 

26.98 27.82 A: mhm 

31.35 32.07 A: right 

36.35 38.03 B: (( curtails ah )) 

38.11 39.61 B: terrorism 

39.87 46.76 A: well i'm not sure i mean i think ah terrorists are going to do whatever it takes to ah carry out their goals 

46.46 52.21 B: yeah yeah i agree with that but i think with the added security and the higher end security now 

47.13 48.39 A: i think that 

52.03 61.81 B: um it has definitely improved things i don't think anything will ever be fool proof um until the terrorists figure out how to get around um 

56.95 57.99 A: right 

61.60 74.30 B: the current security measures but i just read an article today as a matter of fact that two thousand two was the ah safest year for flying uh ever so all the added security measures ah 

71.17 72.04 A: right 

75.02 77.40 B: are doing some good 

76.48 82.85 A: right i i definitely think they are doing some good i think it's ah it's just going to be difficult though because 

82.65 84.41 A: you have i mean for 

84.19 98.41 A: you know certainly it's b- it's better than it has been but there's always going to be certain security holes and and i just know that i live in new york and i know that for whatever screening they do there are people who always tend to slip by if they really want to 

98.20 104.50 B: (( yeah absolutely no doubt there was this situation in philadelphia where um a )) 

104.57 107.19 B: a guy um had left 

107.64 110.22 B: working for the airport um 

110.97 118.54 B: for several months and he was still able to get in get behind none of the passwords had been changed to the doors leading down to the uh 

118.37 130.82 B: tarmac and uh behind security and he had a camera with him and everything so that just exposed that you know even though there is heightened security as far as passengers getting on planes and going through checkpoints that uh 

130.64 138.65 B: i don't think they've done as much with uh behind the scenes security as far as workers and access to restricted areas 

137.81 142.41 A: right you bring up a good point about workers i think it's tough to assume that people who 

142.38 156.18 A: are put in these situations probably not the kind of training that maybe ah you know certain other workers have gotten all throughout their career to expect them to you know to out there i think it's a little bit unrealistic hopefully it's getting better though 

156.34 158.74 B: yeah yeah um 

158.64 167.55 B: and then they uh just made the workers federal employees i don't know what uh that's supposed to ah improve whether it's the screening of uh 

167.44 174.12 B: employees or being able to keep track of them better um i i don't know 

171.39 172.39 A: yeah 

174.34 177.63 B: what that's supposed to improve but um 

176.49 177.84 A: right right 

177.79 191.58 B: i i guess they know whatever they're trying to do there i hope it's doing some well but i do feel like uh because of the added security measures um in recent travels it's probably about the safest time uh there is to fly 

179.58 180.56 A: [laughter] 

191.56 193.28 A: right 

192.56 193.56 B: right now 

193.60 206.99 A: right well i i definitely think i agree with you i think things have gotten quite a bit better um but i really think that until it's ah i mean you sort of still hear about some of the ridiculous things where uh 

206.77 213.90 A: you know i had a friend of mine who was stopped at the airport you know detained and for no reason and they let some other people on which 

213.94 226.71 A: you know i i mean this friend was probably you know sixty years old you know white guy you know businessman you know and uh you know it just seems a little random and then then of course you hear about the ridiculous 

218.63 219.46 B: (( mhm )) 

221.44 222.73 B: yeah yeah 

226.76 232.86 A: you know things where people are stopped with a you know a a a metal earring 'cause they went to th- the metal decec- detector 

232.62 233.48 B: right 

232.94 236.35 A: so but i think they need to have some commonsense right 

234.98 235.74 B: well 

235.58 245.08 B: th- the yes they do but [mn] also my opinion is there's really no ridiculous stuff because uh if you're thinking like a terrorist you're you may be thinking uh 

244.87 250.79 B: okay here's a guy that grew up overseas or in the middle east who looks like a white businessman 

250.59 262.82 B: happens to have light skin or whatever so if you're not going to suspect those people you're opening yourself for a hole there so i mean even if i'm detained and ah gone over i have nothing to hide and and i certainly don't mind it 

262.36 263.75 A: (( yeah right )) 

262.65 272.53 B: um i guess people get aggravated more because of the time constraints because all of a sudden now you're waiting in two hour lines and uh it's taking you longer to get to your flight but 

272.38 278.14 B: again i really don't mind it i don't think there's any uh really ridiculous stops because uh 

278.21 290.81 B: it could be a loop hole you know if ah you know if somebody says ah it's a little old lady she can't possibly be well y-you know they just started using ah female terrorists now in ah 

279.83 281.94 A: no you're absolutely right [mn] mm 

290.79 302.89 B: um israel as far as ah bombers um suicide bombers because they were never suspected or used before so ah and and i don't have a problem w- with it um 

293.61 294.39 A: right 

297.34 298.73 A: right right [mn] 

303.29 314.07 B: uh and then some people say about um the security measure and your rights and everything well when you know you're getting on a public plane or whatever um 

315.14 327.73 B: you know you have to not give up certain rights but i think you know f- for safety you have to be willing to be searched and if you have nothing to hide i don't see why there would be a problem there 

324.09 324.94 A: certainly 

327.59 331.70 A: right right what do you think the ah i i mean 

331.98 340.32 A: you know obviously there are certain [sigh] you know certainly people of mid- middle eastern descent i'm sure have been under a little more scrutiny i mean do you think that that's something that they yeah 

339.05 348.18 B: well this this'll probably be controversial statement but ah i'm all about and i'm all for um racial prof- profiling 

348.00 348.84 A: mhm 

348.17 354.50 B: because let's face it um again i had read an article one time about all the recent um 

354.80 365.62 B: terror attacks around the world and they were carried out by uh men of middle eastern descent between the ages of twenty five and forty they all cer- fit a certain profile 

363.53 364.41 A: right 

365.46 367.77 A: (( right right )) 

366.02 380.78 B: and i mean [mn] that's just fact you call it racial profiling and put a negative connote onto that term but the fact remains that um these are the type of people doing these things so you do have to have an open eye toward that thing 

369.74 370.54 A: right 

377.63 379.32 A: right 

380.29 395.03 A: certainly so with that though what i'm i'm curious about is then when you have i mean you know let's say like a little old lady i mean would you advocate you know stopping her simply just to make sure that uh you know maybe she's not inadvertently carrying something is that 

394.42 398.41 B: well a- a- absolutely she has to go through the same uh 

398.59 399.58 B: um 

400.33 407.61 B: requirements for search and seizure or um random selection that everybody else does um 

406.30 407.16 A: mhm 

407.75 419.57 B: but also i'm saying that if you see a man of middle eastern sus- descent that fits the profile of a terrorist you should take a little extra hard look at him and if he has nothing to hide i don't see what the problem would be 

413.89 414.74 A: right 

416.61 417.50 A: right 

419.44 420.31 A: right 

419.59 431.22 B: um it's when you start um accusing people charging people and treating people differently because of a certain profile that you get into problems but ah 

429.86 431.51 A: right 

431.28 438.32 B: the fact that you know he's he's searched like anybody picked at random would be searched for whatever reason he was picked to be searched 

438.20 453.07 B: and comes up clean then i don't see a problem there but uh if you start taking him in the back and interrogate him intensely and slapping him around or whatever then you find yourself in trouble but then i guess that's a whole nother issue but ah i don't have a i don't have a problem with uh 

441.38 442.97 A: right 

450.32 451.56 A: right [laughter] 

452.94 461.64 B: airport security and beefed up security i think uh the people that have nothing to hide don't either because uh it's for my own safety and my own good 

461.48 463.61 A: right right 

461.52 470.27 B: so i think too many other things can go wrong as far as mechanical that ah maybe they should start paying more attention to also beside security 

465.35 466.27 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

470.02 472.22 A: right right 

470.41 473.24 B: um maintenance of planes and things like that 

472.66 475.49 A: right right what 

473.68 475.44 B: (( ah safety yeah )) 

475.56 481.02 A: yeah what about ah actual ah you know screening of employees you know airp- you know airports you 

480.87 491.72 A: know technicians and pilots and that sort of thing i mean you know i mean i'm sure you remember that the egypt air thing a few years ago where you know i just still think that's up in the air as to what exactly happened 

491.26 493.70 B: yeah yeah um 

493.83 498.96 B: again i guess ah with making airport employees federal employees 

498.71 500.38 A: mhm 

499.17 512.58 B: they're um addressing that issue i don't know exactly how or when but i'm all for adding security and ah screening employees and i think they should have to be randomly drug tested 

512.64 513.48 A: right 

512.78 518.25 B: because if you have a flaw like that that can potentially be a problem or a gap 

518.10 518.92 A: right 

519.00 523.50 B: that ah could be exploited by a terrorist or some other 

519.19 520.91 A: (( yeah )) 

523.68 525.69 B: um criminal network 

523.70 535.43 A: right right i guess what i'm worried about is something like where if you have a foreign carrier you're not going to be subject to the same regulations as a u._s. carrier would be right 

531.13 536.12 B: exactly yeah what do you do then yeah y- y- you're basically uh 

536.10 549.17 B: on your own as far as foreign travel although being recently in spain i mean they had military people um not searching random but searching everybody before we got on the plane from spain back to uh the u._s. 

538.47 540.12 A: right 

549.19 550.34 A: right 

549.94 556.57 B: um so i felt they were doing a good job but ah some other places i guess 

553.75 554.68 A: right 

556.70 557.69 B: um 

558.17 560.26 B: (( yeah so that's mhm )) 

559.03 569.20 A: right now i haven't flown in a couple of ye- actually th- the last time i flew was before september eleventh but the one thing that kind of bothered me is i used to fly out of j._f._k. all the time 

569.08 582.72 A: and ah i would come in i'd have a lot of equipment with me you know com- laptops palm pilot cell phone or whatever and you know and i distinctly remember the airport security being very you know lax about going through 

582.92 592.86 A: you know going through my stuff yeah i'd you know open up show them i had a palm pilot i was never asked to turn it on you know that sort of thing i was wondering if you noticed any change in that type of security 

587.98 588.88 B: (( mhm )) 

592.87 594.33 B: um 

594.46 599.95 B: i i have been asked to turn on my video camera and electronic equipment
