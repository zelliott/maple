0.64 2.64 B: hello i'm dan 

2.51 6.51 A: hi dan my name is garry i live near dayton ohio 

7.39 12.11 B: um um i'm dan and i live in live in michigan 

12.32 15.61 A: oh i talked to someone in michigan last night 

15.29 16.37 B: did you 

16.93 27.06 A: yeah i guess we're talking about um [cough] peace in the middle east and i assume in this respect they're talking about the israeli palestinian situation 

21.22 22.55 B: (( yep )) 

29.62 30.93 A: at least that's my 

30.02 30.80 B: yep 

31.23 32.24 A: i'm sorry 

32.26 34.55 B: oh yeah yeah i'm sorry 

34.77 37.76 A: well my personal opinion is um 

37.89 39.64 A: it's going be a tough go 

40.05 48.05 A: um when you consider the historical situation there whether israel was created by throwing the palestinian's out 

47.96 60.19 A: and the israelis took over the palestinian land and the palestinian's are just irritated as heck they'd like to for their land back but that's not going to happen 

60.48 70.69 A: and so it's one of these situations where neither side is willing to give and i'm not sure what the solution is if there is in fact a solution to the situation 

71.42 72.32 A: um 

72.55 82.77 A: i read one article where a guy suggested maybe the best thing to do is to give them all lots of weapons and see who could kill the other one off and then it would solve the problem [laughter] 

82.60 85.85 B: i don't think that would be the best solution right there 

85.25 87.58 A: no it wouldn't be a solution 

87.35 88.54 B: um 

88.73 102.43 B: from my thoughts and what i gather from other people and from what i hear is that at um now we tend to think that they're fighting just mainly and like cause they're like religion and everything cause their religions are clashing 

102.78 104.13 B: and um 

104.93 110.68 B: i don't know to me i don't see why you know like why we should be involved with 

110.88 118.41 B: you know you can't you know so fight over it and i mean to me i think it's pretty pointless 

119.71 132.16 A: yes it is from um you know we're looking at it from an outside perspective and you know how we the united states can can implement anything i rather doubt um 

132.48 138.82 A: i'm not sure there is a winning solution to this problem it's been going on since nineteen forty seven 

139.16 142.33 A: and the situation doesn't seem to improve 

142.30 150.75 B: yeah um another thing i want to mention too is that you know you tend to see that oh you know um 

150.73 158.75 B: you know all of the fighting is wrong and stuff but yet i mean they're so used to it their accustom to it so it's not that necessarily that big of a deal you know 

158.71 169.85 B: and it's just like an everyday on going thing and you know i mean if they're are to come to here no war or anything i mean i'm sure they'd think it's pretty weird you 

168.82 170.17 A: oh absolutely 

169.98 184.16 B: know so i mean i think it's like they're different cultures and you know i mean i guess i don't think that us being you know americans anything are who to say you know you shouldn't be doing this you shouldn't be doing this when they're used to it you know 

184.93 186.69 A: well 

185.15 190.48 B: i mean when we tend to think it's wrong and everything but like um 

191.11 193.34 B: we think it's wrong but 

193.38 197.37 B: i mean why should we have to stand in the way when it's their fight you know 

197.22 200.45 A: that's absolutely right and um 

200.85 207.29 A: one thing i'm a hand radio operator and i talk to people in israel quite frequently 

206.70 207.69 B: really 

207.28 217.66 A: and i ask a couple of guys um that i talk to over there you know all that we hear on the news is that you guys are blowing each other up every day 

217.83 225.55 A: and his comment was well yeah he said it does happen but out of the whole country it's such a tiny 

225.67 229.55 A: percentage of things that's going on that for every day life 

229.60 235.05 A: it really isn't as big a deal as the news media over here make it out to be 

235.43 248.71 A: um very much like northern ireland where it always sounds like their blowing themselves up over there and i talk to people there and they say uh it's not the situation and realistically i mean there are a lot more people killed in our slums 

248.82 253.20 A: on a weekend than are killed in israel and palestine 

253.58 264.30 A: um we have an on going war in our slums if you will and we don't even think about it it's just that's the way it is 

264.94 266.09 B: (( yeah )) 

265.48 276.48 A: they're places you know i live on the um outside of dayton ohio but i am out in the country side about fifteen miles out but there are section of that town that i don't drive through at night 

276.95 279.14 A: if that's just the way it is 

281.61 283.07 B: (( yep um )) 

283.39 288.37 B: what else i was going to say like just the fact that um 

290.17 291.68 B: (( i don't know like )) 

291.78 298.11 B: you think like a lot of people think that all jews are crazy and everything i mean they're just accustom to it 

299.19 300.80 B: (( that's )) 

301.37 302.12 B: (( you )) 

302.36 303.22 B: know 

302.93 304.50 A: right 

303.40 304.59 B: i mean 

306.01 316.62 A: i'm not sure how the u._s. is going to help the situation it always seems it seems to me like every time we try to help everybody ends up hating us more no 

309.04 310.54 B: oh yeah 

315.70 317.32 B: oh exactly 

316.70 321.14 A: matter who we help that always seems to be wrong 

320.57 321.91 B: (( yep )) 

321.29 329.74 A: they they claim of course that and it's a truism that the um israelis have a very strong lobby in washington 

329.95 335.31 A: and of course the palestinian's say we're on the side of the israelis 

335.52 343.57 A: and of course the israelis think we're on the side of the palestinian's because we're now trying to kiss up to them to try to get into their good favor 

343.44 354.42 A: and they it's a no win situation because you end up after it's all said and done just like in iraq you know we go in there trying to be the good guys we're going to be end up hated more than saddam was 

354.81 357.19 B: yep exactly 

356.64 368.24 A: and we're going to spend probably in the next ten years a trillion dollars on that i worked it out the other night it is probably going to cost us about fifty thousand dollars per iraqi by the time we're done 

366.93 368.00 B: really 

369.20 373.65 A: and we still don't spend that much on our own people 

372.48 386.61 B: oh exactly you know i mean like it seems to me that we're getting carried away with helping people that aren't even our country you know rather than helping our own people that are dying of aids dying of other causes you know 

386.44 388.04 A: absolutely and i 

388.61 390.83 A: (( i don't know it's noble an effort )) 

390.88 394.36 A: but i think it's pretty much like flogging a dead horse 

394.40 400.66 B: i mean this is like basically out of here say or whatever or what happened from but um 

400.64 414.83 B: like people actually told me that um from nine eleven or whatever that the people um the families that died that died or whatever they're families and stuff didn't even get like a any money or anything 

414.03 416.25 A: that's right they're still 

416.15 421.96 B: and like you hear about all of these big donations and stuff and yet where are they going 

422.01 423.29 B: i mean 

422.69 436.19 A: most of the families didn't get what i felt they should of gotten out of it in fact as it started out they weren't going to get much of anything until they made such a stink about it the red cross was going a pocket a big chunk of it 

430.92 432.07 B: (( yep )) 

437.15 441.12 A: so i don't know it's um it's a tough go and 

441.15 450.42 A: should the u._s. be involved well probably but then i have to think where are the europeans at what's with the european union here 

450.32 459.18 A: i mean this is in their backyard these folks don't have any interest in helping out on this situation they are just like we'll let the americans do it 

458.48 460.24 B: yeah 

459.61 471.29 A: and of course we go over there and we end up with a black eye out of the whole situation for trying to help and it just never works out at least it hasn't since world war two 

465.54 467.32 B: (( yep )) 

471.58 478.93 A: um that was probably one of the few cases where we came out actually helping people and they were appreciative of it although 

478.98 489.11 A: you would wonder about it now um a few years later how much appreciation we we get for what we did during that period of reconstruction 

481.18 482.44 B: yeah 

491.14 496.90 B: i don't know i guess it seems to me like um they're like a certain amount of people that are actually 

498.01 498.96 B: (( like )) 

499.66 501.38 B: separate countries you know 

501.56 504.28 B: like um in iraq or whatever you have 

504.75 513.87 B: like and all of those people that are on saddam's side and muslim people are probably just like us they don't want to have anything to do with the war or anything like that you know 

514.00 515.59 B: (( i )) 

516.22 518.38 A: absolutely 

518.08 519.01 B: (( mean )) 

519.36 523.79 B: they're beat up on and kicked on and every thing 

523.90 525.14 B: so 

525.03 528.52 A: if we can't do any better then we did in iran 

529.82 532.25 A: i guess we're going to get chopped 

532.03 535.15 B: yep i mean like i do think that we should have 

535.70 537.37 B: like the palestinian's 

539.48 543.60 B: but i mean if we're just like i 

544.10 545.03 A: right 

544.16 546.30 B: mean wouldn't mind like 

549.40 550.99 B: (( hello )) 

557.13 559.48 A: i think we've been cut off catch you dan 

563.03 563.95 B: hello 

564.07 564.76 A: (( [noise] )) 

566.60 567.53 B: hello
