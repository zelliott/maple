31.89 34.45 B: middle east palestinians 

34.76 44.78 B: the palestinians are getting like i've been reading a lot up on like just the palestinians kind of view point from it really like is a 

44.91 46.14 B: (( city )) 

46.86 56.10 B: and the palestinians like aren't allowed to like build or anything sometimes and they're moved off land and sometimes they're bulldozed off 

55.99 56.96 A: mhm 

56.28 57.63 B: so that's 

57.67 69.10 B: you know they're probably just really angry over all of that stuff and then like when they go to move like if they go like they can't really move really freely with in like on the west bank 

68.62 69.56 A: mhm 

69.25 74.19 B: they can't move around like we would be able to move around 

73.51 87.41 A: yeah that's that's true like well the the thing that i would like to know is this like israel you know cause they have that policy whoever is a suicide bomber um if they find out who the family is they're going to bulldoze their houses and i want to know 

87.24 94.49 A: um i mean if it actually works if it actually deters people from becoming suicide bombers 

94.24 103.09 B: oh the suicide bomber stuff that's weird i don't know the suicide bombers are weird cause i mean they know they are going to kill themselves 

96.51 97.82 A: yeah 

103.03 109.02 A: it's it's really scary i can't even imagine anyone wanting to do that to themselves i mean i can't imagine 

108.52 109.21 B: (( oh )) 

109.93 111.08 B: (( yeah when )) 

111.25 115.61 A: (( being that that )) 

115.54 122.43 B: the um when the um palestinians are like that they they they go at it 

117.12 125.46 A: (( um )) 

122.47 135.10 B: and then they try to look for them to be like in sex and everything you know upsets people and that's not a good thing when they go looking because them people want to get into like a group and they make you get into a group 

134.22 148.64 A: true to a cause i mean it's just yeah they they they tell them that like they are going to have like fifty virgins and have all of this kind of you know stuff to try to get them to try to fight for the cause and you know when they're if if they really know completely what's going 

149.03 152.14 A: or if someone is just trying to convince them to do this you know 

152.92 154.68 A: um but 

154.05 155.37 B: [noise] 

155.41 160.51 A: how do you feel about the new peace process that's that's going on 

160.52 174.19 B: i haven't really read much on it like it's really something that you i don't know you know clinton didn't clinton do that before he was there too didn't like even carter do that too 

174.09 182.10 A: yeah i think i think the u._s. is um i don't know how i don't think they should be completely involved but i think it's 

182.18 186.96 A: good um too have us try to help them reach an agreement 

186.26 187.84 B: [noise] 

187.18 190.51 A: they really need like a neutral third party 

190.43 193.75 B: oh you mean like they need somebody from the outside to come in 

193.76 194.64 A: mhm 

194.12 203.84 B: i don't know it's it's kind of weird like you know all of a sudden they in forty nine they're the jews are allowed to come back in i mean you know how much money they with 

203.81 217.07 B: what you know what they get from us what they get from the u._s. as like you know they what is it like like domestic help or something like foreign foreign aid well we give them as foreign aid 

216.90 220.69 B: like all that they do is really stick it in the bank around somewhere 

220.61 227.66 A: i yeah you know i've always wonder what their that do with it and actually it makes me kind of upset that we have so many problems at home i mean like 

227.58 238.81 A: i live in new york and um there's a lot of homelessness a lot of the time like all of this foreign aid that we're giving to the middle eastern whoever and all of the other countries why don't we use it for ourselves first you know 

238.96 247.34 B: oh yeah well you can't you know you can't live you can't live in a bubble you can't live in a bubble 

243.77 246.85 A: true true yeah 

247.22 256.33 A: that's very true i mean we definitely need to help out and have like the world bank and everything i'm not exactly sure how how that works but i have always kind of wondered that actually 

256.34 260.85 A: but i mean yes i mean especially the countries in africa too i mean 

261.01 264.68 A: i think we're sending our troops into uh liberia now 

264.87 275.74 B: oh yeah like in liberia but that happens all over africa i mean they are going to use liberia they're using liberia as an example of how they want to do things i mean 

275.61 282.14 B: the same thing happens in um where it's in somalia the same thing happens in 

282.61 292.38 B: let's see let's look at some south east asian countries that do that same thing too um that island there's one huh 

289.86 291.18 A: mhm 

291.92 293.04 A: sorry 

292.91 293.88 B: which one 

293.87 297.23 A: like in the in the philippines i think 

295.98 305.69 B: yeah it's somewhere it's somewhere in the far east mideast or something not in the middle east it's i'm trying to remember it's an island it 

305.62 319.99 B: used to be called and i forget what it's called now and they have troops out there and they're always fighting too so it's always it's kind of like where would you find the greatest excuses because you because it makes you money 

305.72 307.14 A: mhm 

320.57 323.49 B: or what else there is other places too 

323.31 336.66 A: yeah i mean i don't know how much money there is to be made in liberia but in terms of like iraq i mean they have i mean they can make a lot of money off the oil but i hope they take all of that money that they sell the oil and put it into rebuilding iraq you know 

336.58 343.59 B: oh and then building itself i'm sure that they have had a lot of money enough themselves already you know 

343.30 348.32 A: oh yes they can finally you know like a million dollars here and a million dollars there 

347.49 351.85 B: oh yeah really like can you just imagine like just having bury a million dollars 

351.23 357.77 A: that's incredible i mean i wouldn't mind finding it i'm sure there's soldiers probably keep some right [laughter] 

356.94 359.14 B: yeah really 

358.01 360.35 A: i don't know about that but 

360.73 363.55 B: they thought they do try to keep some you know 

363.54 375.86 B: but if they know if they look to shuffle they i'm sure they will check them how do you get rid of like let's say one hundred thousand dollars in your you know in your pants pocket you know while you're walking across the desert 

368.17 369.20 A: mhm 

375.88 379.50 A: yeah [laughter] but um 

379.64 390.69 A: like i think i've been reading a lot of stuff and i've been increasingly concerned about how um a lot of the evidence that bush used to convince everyone to attack iraq was found to be false 

387.59 390.03 B: oh yeah 

390.17 402.03 B: i know it turned out to be false i mean like they never really found anything they really didn't find any like i mean he probably moved it out way before hand but still you never 

402.04 403.42 B: unless you know 

404.03 408.11 B: (( um yeah hold on wait [noise] )) 

404.22 405.54 A: yeah 

406.65 407.67 A: (( what )) 

408.89 410.00 A: (( was it )) 

412.22 413.04 A: hello 

421.06 421.87 A: hello 

421.19 423.26 B: [noise] my neighbor's are here i'm sorry 

423.10 424.34 A: oh that's okay 

423.94 436.99 B: no i just no you're right that's right i'm just trying to find the per instances that he said that he lied about or did he just like they didn't they they missed the omission or something 

436.85 437.86 A: mhm 

437.48 448.76 B: like they just don't sometimes like the work i kind of do that you realise sometimes that like one agency doesn't talk to the other agency about what the other ones doing and then 

448.61 449.64 A: mhm 

449.12 460.25 B: so it often happens like that and it's never like ci- i think it was like a c._i._a. or the f._b._i. like they supposedly like the like supposedly 

460.45 466.47 B: they they don't arrest as many criminals as like state police do 

466.41 467.38 A: yeah 

466.77 476.22 B: like they never as per as the amount of money that you give them they never arrest as many people as you would think they would 

475.62 476.66 A: mhm 

476.28 482.91 B: yet they're very sophisticated agency that's supposed to be so um detailed and correct so 

482.84 484.16 A: (( yeah )) 

483.01 486.47 B: i guess we're just seeing the finding the errors 

486.25 497.45 A: yeah exac- i mean because i think um bush even put it in his um state of the union appearance but then they claimed that we would of attacked them anyway even if it wasn't true so 

497.38 501.69 A: but it's it's kind of hard to go back and look at it like that you know 

501.50 515.20 B: yeah it's an error is what it is it's an error he and he just he's aired and they just i i'm sure they just and they all just try to cover themselves and make it sound good so it's the end 

504.37 505.43 A: yeah 

514.57 521.64 A: oh yeah yeah they always um i mean there is always some stuff that we're never going to know 

521.60 533.51 A: but i often think that the government like tries to hide well like actually tells too much even while we're attacking iraq i mean we knew where the troops were and everything i thought it was too much information 

532.84 539.49 B: [noise] oh you thought it was too much i think there is always one i always think that there's information that we don't know 

539.32 540.49 A: that's true 

540.11 543.89 B: like they're always a conspiracy theory right 

543.11 548.68 A: of course yeah no there is always stuff that we don't know but i felt like you know they had those reporters were embedded in 

548.68 554.58 B: no that was more about television and c._n._n. did a really awful job really 

554.35 558.58 A: mhm yeah i don't i don't think they did a great job either 

558.05 560.22 B: i think they did an awful job 

560.34 567.54 A: yeah it was it was boring to watch and too and they showed some guy like in the you know like riding like 

568.36 574.13 A: you couldn't even see you couldn't even see much and there was like it wasn't very in depth it was just like 

574.17 580.41 A: you know people just wanted to see the soldiers running around i thought n._b._c. did a much better job on that 

581.45 583.69 B: yeah 

583.05 589.48 A: yeah because they actual did some more in depth coverage and like it was it was like more understandable 

588.98 599.35 B: it was kind of nice to see some of like the foreign agency's do other ones like that seemed like to be really good like the foreign one like they come 

595.95 596.97 A: yeah 

599.43 599.89 B: like
