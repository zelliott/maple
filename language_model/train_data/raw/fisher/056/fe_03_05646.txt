0.20 1.74 A: hi i'm jeffery 

1.67 3.10 B: hey i'm rob 

3.14 4.22 A: (( how're ya doin' [noise] )) 

4.09 7.65 B: pretty good um uh what was the topic again how does airport security 

6.23 12.79 A: the topic is yeah is uh airport security uh any better [mn] basically 

12.89 19.52 A: um since nine eleven i mean i haven't been on a airline since nine eleven so 

18.78 20.45 B: yeah same here 

20.23 32.79 A: i i all i can go by is the reports that i've seen in the news and seen a number of what they do the undercover um where they show how they were able to breach 

33.06 35.00 A: airport security 

35.13 46.21 A: so to me it's not so much i think they they there are probably more eyes out there looking for things but i don't know how much more secure it is 

40.43 40.99 B: (( [mn] )) 

45.76 60.46 B: right i i i think it's a little better but i really don't think that it really can prevent terrorists 'cause i know they do a lot more random searches and stuff like that but i don't i really don't think that um uh like if terrorists really wanted to get on the plane i still think they could 'cause there's so many it's like 

51.19 51.97 A: right 

53.19 54.04 A: right 

58.65 59.83 A: uh yes 

60.32 63.62 B: basically if you know the right people it's like you could get in 

63.52 75.05 A: right yeah 'cause money talks [laughter] unfortunately money talks and and and [mn] and yeah if you drop enough money on somebody well look i i'll i'll act like i didn't see you 

65.65 67.12 B: right right 

75.76 79.58 A: you know um 

76.22 86.15 B: right right like um uh i got when i go like i used to go to india and like whenever i go there like me and my family don't even have to go through customs and everything just because we know people 

85.85 86.71 A: okay 

86.22 92.33 B: like so it's really shady like i i don't know i really think airport security everywhere is terrible 

92.34 94.61 B: um uh i don't know 

93.30 94.98 A: except for one place 

95.00 97.71 A: except for one place israel 

96.72 97.75 B: what place 

97.73 100.41 A: israel they've never had 

97.83 98.77 B: israel 

100.46 105.05 A: they've never had a a problem it'll to my knowledge they um 

104.95 118.81 A: 'cause they've always had uh what do you call it the uh on air uh marshals but and and and israel hasn't had a prob- like they've never had a a bombing of any of their planes i don't think they've ever had a hijacking of any of their planes 

118.92 124.46 A: um so i think they're the only ones that that can um 

122.39 126.88 B: well what are marshals are they just like basically like policemen on a plane or something 

126.26 132.80 A: right they're they're the policemen on a plane and that's what uh a number of the um u._s. airlines are doing 

132.71 143.41 A: 'cause i know they were hiring for that you know and um between that having marshals on there um and then this whole thing where the airline 

143.33 155.96 A: uh what do you call it the uh transport what i can't think of the name of the exact organisation but the new people that they put in place to do the the searching as you go through um the 

154.12 155.04 B: right 

156.21 161.53 A: uh the checkpoints and checking the bags most of those people when i saw 

161.42 175.56 A: uh one of the evening newscasts that some of those people haven't been totally cleared 'cause they were trying to reach a a a certain number by a certain time and they just filled the positions and are still checking their backgrounds so 

175.65 179.47 B: yeah i that that just sounds really bad god 

178.55 179.41 A: yeah 

179.84 181.06 B: um uh 

182.16 183.35 A: so you haven't been 

182.30 188.85 B: what would you what what what would you do though um uh differently that would help uh airport security what what would you like 

188.71 190.21 A: well you [mn] 

190.51 194.83 A: to me one of the things is i know like i'm from philly where are you from 

194.88 196.60 B: i'm from uh detroit 

196.72 202.98 A: okay in philly one of the things that they have done is they've they've done away with curbside uh 

201.17 201.75 B: (( uh-huh )) 

202.99 213.97 A: uh uh check in i think they're going to reinstate it 'cause of the fact of you know the low level of uh whatever it is the that uh our former governor 

214.09 221.63 A: is now that he's head of uh homeland security reeves tom reeves i think they're going to allow uh curbside 

221.40 232.75 A: check ins to start up again but you know they stopped all the parking there any type of parking you know you have to go inside the airport now and and uh check your bags 

232.57 246.02 A: uh because of the concern of someone just pulling up leaving a bag walking away and perhaps you know blowing it up but i mean you could almost do the same thing inside the the uh terminal um but to answer your question 

243.38 244.30 B: right 

246.29 250.23 A: [mn] that's a that's a that's a darn good question what would i do 

250.59 254.64 A: to to to change things i you know i probably would have 

254.91 256.28 A: even more 

256.34 257.52 A: um 

257.71 259.23 A: more armed 

259.42 260.60 A: uh 

261.71 264.72 A: uh what do they call it the uh not the coastguard the uh 

265.37 267.71 A: national guard in the airport 

266.87 267.63 B: hey 

267.75 278.68 B: but basically if if i felt like our borders were more secure i think i'd feel a lot more comfortable just 'cause like um uh like whenever i go to canada and come back sometimes it's really easy and like i don't feel like they're doing a good enough job 

268.10 268.90 A: (( i )) 

278.46 280.03 A: oh really okay 

278.47 283.93 B: on screening people yeah um uh 'cause this is right next to windsor and everything so 

282.97 283.92 A: right 

283.91 297.15 B: so um uh we go across ambassador bridge and like it's really easy to come back sometimes like sometimes they don't even ask for my passport and stuff like i i don't know like it just makes me worried sometimes 'cause like anybody like the people who came from nine eleven i think i think some of the people came from canada 

297.09 300.70 B: so that makes me feel really scared so i don't know 

297.93 298.88 A: right 

299.82 314.13 A: yeah uh yeah [mn] well that's a good point too you know probably yeah uh uh beefing up the patrol on the uh on on the borders [mn] uh it it's look i agree with you if if they really want to do something 

309.36 310.37 B: right 

314.10 319.70 A: they're going to be able to do it they may not i don't think they'll ever be able to do anything to 

319.88 327.78 A: the to the to the to the extreme of what they did in nine eleven but they can do little things i mean here 

326.75 327.59 B: right 

327.67 341.15 A: you know in philly like uh and it may be the same i mean i've been to detroit a couple of times but you know i haven't been all around the city our our water um system in terms of you know 'cause they have uh 

332.59 333.43 B: (( mhm )) 

341.85 349.46 A: where the water comes from the they purify it runs through the system and comes through into your house it's wide open they just started putting up 

349.33 359.28 A: uh wrought iron fences what used to be just cyclone fences around it now they're starting to put up wrought iron fences i don't know whether that's to prevent somebody from actually driving in and dropping something in 

359.07 373.09 A: but you could take something and hur- and throw it over the fence into the water if you want to kill somebody or kill people so to me the wrought iron fence means nothing you can just take whatever you want and throw it in there [laughter] i i don't know 

362.76 363.67 B: yeah 

364.79 365.73 B: right 

365.87 366.68 B: right 

370.66 371.87 B: right 

372.37 378.07 B: the only the only thing it really prevents is people from coming across but that doesn't really stop like them chucking bombs or something over 

376.47 377.14 A: right 

378.76 380.72 B: so um uh 

380.76 382.83 B: we're supposed to talk for how long eight minutes 

381.67 386.39 A: um ten minutes and they'll let us know uh at the point 

384.96 386.42 B: ah i see 

386.50 398.51 A: so you you used to i used to ride for i used to ride places i used to uh fly quite a bit and like i said since nine eleven i haven't been on a plane since nine eleven so i don't know i only hear from people 

398.57 399.95 A: um 

400.26 401.99 A: you know what they've gone through 

400.43 412.27 B: like i hear i i know that like checking in your bags and everything takes a lot longer 'cause like um uh i think they do a better job of that i i hope um uh but that's all i really know that's really a big chance 

404.83 405.82 A: right 

412.64 418.80 B: so it was just the waiting line um uh i really don't know what else they they do that's different um uh that would really help out 

418.67 431.22 B: if they had marshals on the planes or something like that uh i'd feel a lot better 'cause like if like people come on like i think they had packaging knives or something for nine eleven um uh on airplane if if there are just some marshals on the plane like 

431.22 436.74 B: they'd probably be able to help out a lot i'd feel a lot more comfortable if um uh if some more of those people were on 

433.25 434.16 A: right 

436.85 437.95 A: well i do 

436.89 441.37 B: but do they have do they have people like that on every plane right now or do they only have them on some 

440.01 449.43 A: no i don't think they have 'em on every plane i think they have 'em on some planes and i'm not really big on the pilots carrying guns but 

449.51 462.89 A: [sigh] you know it it's um i think there's one air i think they were pushing for that and i think it went through where the pilots will be allowed to start carrying guns i don't know if that's a good idea um 

449.59 451.55 B: planes the pilots the pilots carry guns now 

462.22 464.23 B: yeah i don't know about that 

463.91 471.47 A: um but [sigh] you know [sigh] well you gotta do something well you is everything right is everybody want to agree with everything no 

471.32 472.32 B: that's true 

471.55 477.13 A: but you you're trying to make people feel more comfortable um and uh 

474.66 475.60 B: right 

477.69 487.14 A: you know i i [mn] to be honest with you like i said i mean i guess it's just a matter of sitting down and not and just trying to uh come up with a brainstorm 

486.99 494.42 A: what are you going to do to make people feel more secure going through the airports flying um i i just 

487.16 488.13 B: right 

492.87 494.18 B: another reason 

494.24 502.47 B: another reason they might want to like another reason um all the airlines might not be able to do all is just 'cause like it costs so much money and a lot of airlines were losing business anyway 

501.56 505.00 A: [mn] yeah they're losing bus- yeah they're losing money yeah uh 

503.93 510.01 B: so that that might that might be why like we haven't seen as much change as they wanted like they might want to do more but they might not be able to 

509.95 523.18 A: right well i you know i i know it cost a a lot to to uh replace a door but i was for the stronger doors you know between the pilots and um between the cabin and the rest of the plane 

523.19 527.03 A: um because if they put a stronger door there at least 

527.08 530.21 A: you know unless you are one right 

528.21 531.82 B: barricade yourselves inside the the cockpit or whatever 

531.23 544.23 A: right it'll be it'll be a lot harder unless you happen to be one of the people in the cockpit that's a terrorist uh so that way you know you might you you might end up losing some lives if they say well if you don't open the door we're going to take a life 

536.12 537.00 B: right 

544.28 559.08 A: and it's a shame because you can say you can speak now until it happens to be someone that you know or one of your relatives that might have been sacrificed as a result of them not opening a door you know the take off for the plane to um you know not be hijacked 

558.54 560.33 B: (( right [mn] )) 

559.74 562.22 A: you know so that's it's it's difficult 

562.37 566.40 B: right it's it's a icky situation i i don't i really don't know um uh 

566.78 575.09 B: what we could do that would like make everyone comfortable but we could definitely do stuff and make at least some people comfortable like everyone isn't going to like everything like you said so i don't know 

571.87 572.79 A: right 

574.24 580.36 A: yeah yeah it's it's going to take time it's going to take time and you know i i think they've done 

580.23 590.16 A: you know it's a shame it took nine eleven for them to kinda wake up 'cause i think they've done things and they've put things in motion to try to prevent things from happening and now 

589.96 599.89 A: they're doing like you know making the from the from the sky they can see a pin drop on the ground you know with with with the satellites that they have up there i think now that they're
