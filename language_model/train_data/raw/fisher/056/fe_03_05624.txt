11.51 12.59 B: rodney 

12.61 14.32 A: rodney hi stephen 

14.28 15.36 B: hi 

16.82 19.40 A: so ah sports athletes huh 

20.27 21.94 B: (( what's my favorite athlete )) 

22.21 27.39 A: no no the topic was to talk about ah sports athletes you know wh- whether you believe 

26.29 27.27 B: yeah 

28.03 29.77 A: so what's what's your opinion 

30.94 31.98 B: (( ah )) 

33.01 42.22 B: i believe they shouldn't strike because they're getting paid all this money you know they shouldn't be striking if they're getting paid all this sum of money that they get paid 

41.38 42.37 A: um 

42.95 48.77 A: did you ever did you ever hear about how ah sports athletes initially like guys in baseball how it initially started off 

49.65 54.53 A: basically back back in like the twenties and thirties and stuff ah up until i think it was the seventies 

49.97 51.04 B: (( you know er )) 

54.67 59.14 A: ah you were required to work for a specific team for i think it was 

59.41 69.37 A: it was it was you know your your entire contract you had to work for a specific team and then you couldn't leave that team unless they wanted to give you away 

69.42 73.98 A: so these guys were sort of stuck in a situation where they had to 

74.02 81.75 A: where like you know that's why mickey mantle and all these other guys you know were on the same team for you know their entire career it's because they never had the option of leaving 

82.22 96.75 A: um so you know basically the first strike was initiated because these guys were getting screwed they were getting paid way under value and you know they initially struck because you know they wanted to and they wanted to be able to leave 

96.61 106.12 A: um yeah so back in the day you know initially for them to get that i can understand why they were striking nowadays it's a lot different 

104.75 105.88 B: yeah well now 

106.42 112.52 B: (( and obviously now it's different they're striking for you know they're striking for you know and that but )) 

111.39 112.30 A: yeah 

112.50 114.06 A: and i mean what what 

112.57 114.17 B: i see no reason 

114.61 117.74 B: (( and i see no reason for them to be striking for that )) 

117.53 122.90 A: yeah and one one one of the main problems that you hear that you know these guys you know who 

122.82 133.94 A: you know m- most guys you know the m- the minimum salary in basketball baseball and stuff you know i- is a high very salary you know whether it's five hundred thousand or a million dollars doesn't really matter it's a lot of money 

133.71 135.86 B: (( yeah it's a lot of money [laughter] )) 

133.94 144.93 A: what makes what makes what makes you sick are the guys that are making like sixty million dollars going on strike saying it's not enough that that's you know i think that's the main problem you know a lot of people 

140.02 140.90 B: yeah 

143.76 145.01 B: that's bad 

144.99 145.97 A: yeah 

145.09 150.46 B: that's bad the guys who are making a lot of money shouldn't be striking you know leave that for the guys who are making less money 

150.80 152.32 B: (( you know if they strike on )) 

151.16 160.92 A: yeah and and unfortunately i mean th- this strike goes on for all players so you don't really know if it's the guys who are making you know the si- the minimum within 

161.25 166.73 A: ah you know within a league or or it's the guys who are making sixty million and want to make a hundred million 

167.00 168.27 A: and you know 

167.22 168.21 B: (( instead of )) 

168.31 168.87 B: (( st- )) 

169.25 172.52 B: (( instead of striking why don't they just go and talk to management )) 

173.32 182.34 A: yeah i mean you know what i don't know if we know enough about it honestly i mean because you know there are a lot of guys who go back and renegotiate their contracts 

182.43 191.48 A: um you know those guys you know they'll be in the paper like you know alexander rodriguez going on a tax list and getting what was it a hundred and eighty million dollars 

191.51 195.83 A: (( i mean i don't know the number off hand but it was like the most it was the highest salary that any )) 

196.46 199.26 A: ah ba- baseball player's ever gotten 

199.65 212.97 A: so i mean guys like that you know maybe they can't go to management and renegotiate but you know the guys who are warming the bench can't really do that you know management doesn't really give a shit about the third string catchers you know they can replace them with another third string catcher but 

212.80 223.49 A: if that guy is having you know issues paying his bills which i don't know if that's you know i don't know if i really see that if he's making league minimums which is you know a few hundred thousand dollars 

223.55 224.77 B: yeah but 

223.86 226.32 A: yeah be lucky he made the major league 

226.55 232.43 B: yeah but these guys all have people that take care of like their contracts and things and all that stuff for them 

234.84 236.41 A: yeah i i don't know 

237.37 245.86 B: (( yeah but i believe they have a manager to take care of your paperwork you know and you just concentrate on playing baseball you know you have people that take care of that )) 

244.59 253.19 A: as far as as far as the managers go um i don't know where their loyalties lie as far as you know taking care of the players 

253.22 263.37 A: um i mean it's really more the owners and then you know the way the owners are portrayed nowadays especially i mean like i i live in new york i don't know where you are oh 

262.01 263.83 B: yeah i'm in new york 

263.57 271.46 A: are you yeah i mean like steinbruner's always looked at as you know a heartless guy who will pay anything for a good player and probably doesn't give a shit about 

271.01 276.51 B: because all he all steinbruner wants to do is win win that's all he wants to do 

275.70 278.35 A: exactly and you know what you know there was 

278.42 289.10 A: there was with the league structured right now like the top the top three teams in the league have to give a certain amount of money to the bottom three leagues to the bottom three teams in the league 

289.36 300.28 A: so like steinbruner and i don't know boston and texas chicago or something they have to give like you know five million dollars to toronto and kansas city at the end of every year 

300.19 309.96 A: and you know if steinbruner were to make out that he was like you know what he was like i i hate giving money to these guys because when i bought a team i wasn't stupid enough to buy it in some crappy franchise 

310.14 320.15 A: you know that that that's steinbruner's mentality i mean like yo- you're doing all this stuff to win you know if if you can make that kind of money because you got a franchise in 

321.03 324.96 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

322.52 326.43 B: (( i know yeah it's just about a wining mentality so )) 

326.07 328.02 A: yeah 

327.68 331.00 B: and that steinbruner he just want to win so he will pay 

331.13 332.31 B: any money you 

332.63 335.66 B: know to get anybody like oh he went and get gianni i 

335.85 339.78 A: yeah but i have i have friends from boston that that hate steinbruner 

340.12 340.93 B: (( know )) 

340.84 347.11 A: but the thing about is you know it's i mean all what he does is he pays a lot of money to get the best players 

346.95 356.35 B: yeah yeah he did that for yeah he did that for roger clemens he got roger clemens you know then he went out there and get gianni after the season 

348.05 350.29 A: and you know he wins 

354.81 358.40 A: roger clemens is a great frigging player 

358.25 360.25 B: yeah so you know 

360.57 362.75 B: (( but yankee's got some good players on there )) 

360.61 366.22 A: i mean you're talking about the yankees striking and i mean it may be like one reasons like you know 

366.01 377.09 A: since we're living in new york you know it it's a little harder for us to understand substantially because you know all the guys are yankee you know play on yankees to make megabucks 

377.08 378.15 B: (( yeah i know )) 

377.42 382.61 A: and you know maybe the guys in toronto aren't making it i don't know i mean they can't fill the seats 

382.91 388.12 A: so you know i- the way it works is they do it with the entire league 

388.62 399.78 A: um you know the league votes so if all the yankees vote no we don't want to strike you know all the other teams say yes we do people in new york will still look at the yankee players and say you know you guys struck screw you 

399.68 401.91 B: (( [laughter] yep so )) 

402.24 403.81 B: (( but they earn a )) 

404.77 405.74 B: (( ah )) 

407.09 410.18 B: salary a a baseball player's supposed to be making 

411.13 412.61 A: what is the salary 

412.86 413.98 B: yeah 

414.89 421.57 A: i mean guy guys that start make a lot more than guys that don't obviously but um 

421.73 434.72 A: i i know they make a few hundred grand if you know they're playing at all i mean if they're on the team if your on the roster you get at worst league minimum and league minimum is you know two three five hundred thousand dollars 

435.21 436.96 B: (( okay i think that's )) 

437.31 438.31 B: (( oh )) 

437.33 439.16 A: yeah 

439.02 451.82 A: i mean when when you're talking you know to the guys just out of school or you know the guys who've been working sanitation jobs that are making forty you know twenty forty or sixty grand and hearing that you know the guys the 

439.30 440.25 B: (( that much )) 

451.74 457.88 A: guys that they want to root for saying oh a million dollars doesn't can't feed my kids 

459.21 462.43 B: those in the minor league are making even less than that
