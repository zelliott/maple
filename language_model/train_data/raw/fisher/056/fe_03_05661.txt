4.61 5.76 B: [noise] hello 

5.35 6.66 A: hi 

7.11 8.05 B: hi 

7.98 10.10 A: hi i'm seth i'm from new york 

10.44 14.19 B: hi a- ah this is brigosh [noise] from missouri 

14.07 27.06 A: oh wow missouri tonight isn't this the best thing ever i love it all right so what's our topic airline security it's so political lately first nine eleven and now this 

15.99 17.04 B: yeah 

19.13 20.34 B: yeah 

22.93 23.88 B: yes 

27.07 28.79 B: yeah 

28.02 30.19 A: um you wanna start or shall i 

31.37 40.28 B: ah yes ah do you think increased airline security has reduced the terrorist threat that was the question that was given a- 

37.66 39.49 A: [laughter] 

39.62 49.31 A: no i don't think so i think it's just ah wasted a lot of people's money and a lot of people's time because they're obviously not gonna do anything in the airlines anymore they 

49.47 62.76 A: they're gonna find something new to do i mean it's stupid to do the same things over and over so they're not gonna [noise] do the airlines so why are we spending all this time doing security when it's so obvious that they're gonna come up with some new idea 

63.80 68.17 A: [noise] and it wastes our time and i don't like taking off my shoes [noise] 

68.88 70.28 B: y- you think so 

70.05 74.80 A: yeah and then they racial profile which is ridiculous my friend is indian 

74.72 87.49 A: and they like took her aside they didn't take me aside 'cause i'm white and it's just ridiculous and she said that when she travels with her family they take all of 'em aside even the grandmother who's like this old indian woman 

82.22 83.30 B: (( uh-huh mhm mhm )) 

87.28 88.08 B: yeah 

87.38 91.48 A: 'cause they don't realize that indian people are totally different than arab people 

90.89 92.23 B: yeah that's true 

91.27 104.62 A: and then they're like they say they make 'em take off all their clothes and their shoes and stuff and they do all this like strip searching stuff and then she went with me on vacation and we didn't get stopped at all 'cause she's with me and i'm white 

105.39 107.10 B: yeah 

106.57 107.19 A: (( [noise] )) 

108.27 109.93 A: 'cause the government sucks 

110.06 111.21 B: yeah 

110.25 110.88 A: (( [noise] )) 

112.66 115.84 A: (( [noise] do you have anything to add [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

114.84 115.87 B: (( ah )) 

116.14 124.64 B: i think it's better ah it's better that ah we increase the security and ah i like the racial profiling also because 

124.66 135.87 B: o- of course there are going to be mistakes people don't know that ah indians are different from pakistanis or ah or that because they all look alike there is definitely a chance that they can 

136.04 146.97 B: (( misidentify people but that is not a reason to ah not do the racial profiling because if you don't do that how do you catch the )) 

147.35 148.71 B: problematic people 

148.15 153.29 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah but the terrorist is just as likely to be white that's their problem is all the 

152.62 155.84 B: no that's not always true it could be anybody it could 

154.15 163.98 A: all they have to do is find a white person who agrees with them politically and they send the white person in the white person has no problem getting through and blowing things up 

165.27 174.52 B: see racial profiling is not the only solution racial profiling is good but that's not all you have to be alert on all fronts 

174.95 177.38 A: but it's impossible to cover all fronts 

177.33 190.52 A: they need to probabilistically randomize what they're doing or they should just do it to everybody because it's ridiculous that they don't i mean now in newark they make us all take off our shoes which is stupid but at least 

185.90 187.14 B: that's true 

190.30 194.63 A: we're all doing it because one person had one shoe bomb 

191.54 196.87 B: (( i agree with you they have to do it for everybody not just a few )) 

196.80 197.57 A: [noise] 

196.94 204.22 B: random set of people that's wrong that's ah not going to be effective you have to do it for everybody 

205.82 207.30 B: that's my opinion 

207.64 215.06 A: but they're not going to 'cause it takes so much money so they're just going to do it to the people who racially then then they racially profile them 

214.58 222.95 B: that's okay if you don't have enough money at least ah focus your ah attention on those who you think may cause trouble 

223.86 225.38 B: that's okay i think 

224.72 227.30 A: that's bigotry and racism [noise] 

228.59 229.48 B: see 

230.83 241.22 B: (( sometimes you have to do racial profiling because you know how these people are the people who ah did the nine eleven we know they're arab p- people )) 

241.44 249.24 A: [noise] well that was just one terrorist attack there are plenty of white people who are terrorist attacked i mean the real fucked up people in the country are all the christians [noise] 

250.29 260.74 A: i mean they're the ones who blow things up you never know you never know who's gonna do it it's all about religion the what you need to do is abolish religion and then you won't have any more problems in the world 

254.91 255.98 B: but they 

262.92 263.74 B: mm 

264.30 279.22 A: that's the real issue but for now they're just gonna racial profile people and nothing's happening obviously 'cause no one's gonna make another terrorist attack with the airplanes because they're gonna do something much more creative than that 'cause they're really smart people 

279.70 287.98 A: maybe they'll blow up the hoover dam or something with cars they'll use cars this time or helicopters you know they could use helicopters [noise] 

288.18 299.47 B: that is also a possibility but just because that's a possibility we should not discount this possibility happening again they can do the same thing that they did on nine eleven again wh- who knows 

298.45 312.14 A: no they're not gonna do it again because they know people are looking out for it you can't do something if people are looking out for you to do it again they're obviously gonna come up with something so clever and new that no one has seen it coming 

312.45 314.50 B: if you don't um 

314.67 320.70 B: do this kind of airline security you're opening you're leaving the war doors open 

317.09 322.27 A: [noise] it's bullshit to make the people you're you're but it's all bullshit 

322.66 325.49 A: you're making all these people go through this hassle 

325.32 334.94 A: when there's no point in it and it's a waste of time and a waste of money and people are scared to fly for stupid reasons because they're not gonna do anything again 

334.72 341.55 A: and if something blows up it's not gonna be terrorists it's just gonna be a random person and it could m- just as easily be anyone 

349.34 352.16 A: [noise] i'm having carrots that's why i'm chewing [noise] 

352.58 354.23 B: yeah i'm sure 

356.81 357.81 B: (( ah )) 

358.99 360.43 B: i don't know what to say 

360.80 363.53 A: well it's your turn i talked a lot 

362.89 364.19 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

364.57 365.65 B: (( ah )) 

370.57 381.43 B: see on the one hand you are saying this is all waste of money and we don't have to do all this but on the other hand you are saying be- if we because we are doing all this terrorists are not going to do 

381.96 383.34 B: the same thing again 

384.06 386.90 B: so you are contradicting yourself 

386.84 392.25 A: no i don't think if we didn't do any of it the terrorists would do the same thing again anyway 

392.35 397.19 B: because then the security's going to be like it was on september tenth 

397.02 405.68 A: it's still the same the security is still the same there hasn't been any changes and if there are they're so stupid that it they haven't made any difference 

405.91 407.59 A: and i'm sure that if 

407.72 418.24 A: they had the same security in place they have right now that this september eleventh still would've happened n- it's nothing they've done has prevented that 

418.92 433.07 A: because the people worked smart and they beat the system and so now you change the system the people will learn how to adapt to the new system because terrorism cannot be stopped by s- by making the rest of the general public suffer by you know having more security 

433.20 438.74 A: terrorism can't be stopped in fact it can't be stopped at all which is why it really sucks 

438.64 449.34 A: and that's the biggest problem and the what the country should do is stop meddling with the rest of the world's affairs and mind our own business and maybe instead of putting all this money to blow up iraq 

449.13 464.13 A: so we get lower oil prices which still hasn't even happened maybe we should spend the money on educating people or providing free health care for our citizens and for worrying about the homeless and for providing you know more affordable college for people 

463.97 473.40 A: why don't we put the money there instead of w- wasting it blowing up the rest of the world so that the rest of the world gets so angry at us that they have to come and do terrorism 

472.83 478.50 B: i agree with you one hundred per cent on all the points ah that you mentioned ah just now 

479.06 483.95 B: we should um not meddle into others' affairs that much i agree 

484.07 497.40 A: i don't understand why we have been and we've been doing it for years and so i mean it's the government's fault that nine eleven happened it's not you know anyone's fault but the government the government and religion 

497.43 503.52 A: it's always religion's fault her people s- all stop believing in god then we wouldn't have any war 

506.40 511.26 A: well it's true [laughter] my friend tan is laughing at me 

513.16 514.88 B: (( mm yeah )) 

514.87 520.96 A: i must say it's really nice and cool today which is such a nice change 

521.08 522.28 B: yeah 

522.58 528.56 A: it's just so funny that they pay us to talk about such random ass topics 

527.50 528.55 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

528.56 530.49 B: is this your first time or 

530.06 532.32 A: no this is my third time now 

531.93 532.98 B: okay 

532.69 547.17 A: i don't know if that's the limit but i like the topics that weren't political i mean i'm sick of talking politics i like the the health and fitness day where we just talked about working out all the time that was nice and low key 

539.43 540.38 B: (( b- [noise] yeah )) 

544.38 546.04 B: yeah 

547.52 548.68 B: yeah 

549.24 559.67 A: these are heated debates we're having here tonight i know i got this guy from michigan and he's all like it's a different world in michigan what do i know about michigan you know 

551.93 553.25 B: they're sa- [laughter] 

554.84 555.77 B: yeah 

559.37 560.59 B: yeah 

562.74 563.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

565.33 573.51 A: all right so i guess we just keep talking airline security sucks [noise] i hate flying i just went to chicago 

567.60 568.83 B: yeah um 

569.11 570.08 B: okay 

573.76 576.31 A: (( and they made me take off my shoes )) 

576.23 582.20 A: but i it wasn't so bad newark wasn't bad at all which is funny 'cause i think september eleventh flew out of newark 

582.11 584.51 A: and it took us no time at all to get through 

582.30 582.99 B: (( mm )) 

584.40 598.54 A: and then we went through midway and that actually didn't take any time either they didn't even have me take off my shoes they had my friend take off her shoes 'cause she's indian though and i laughed i i thought that was really funny [laughter] but we only had carry ons 

592.89 593.60 B: yeah 

595.69 596.59 B: yeah 

598.92 599.89 A: it was very very
