85.88 90.24 A: does heightening security in the air reduce the risk of terrorism 

91.91 97.71 B: well i i i really believe that we got to have some good high security in our country 

97.98 105.17 A: i think it does but it's you know there's a lot of things that like i would never want to do something a lot of the things that 

105.15 115.27 A: they're stupid like the people that um you know the people that check you at the airports they're just too underpaid they're paid like seven dollars an hour they're not going to be you know trained enough or qualified enough to know what to look for 

115.51 122.78 B: well i think that's better though than having somebody take advantage of our of the freedom that they have and blowing up our country 

123.02 124.07 B: uh 

123.42 129.42 A: no i know i i'm just saying that i think i think you know know sp- spend a little bit more money and and uh 

129.43 131.79 A: you know have a have more of 

132.76 136.68 A: the like taxes go to security and you know they 

135.48 144.39 B: uh i believe we have to spend as much money as we need in order to make sure that the liberties that we have are secured and that's very important you know 

142.09 142.98 A: (( right )) 

144.38 153.90 A: yeah but uh i'd like to have uh you know spending like billions of dollars to make more nuclear bombs or whatever they make they can use that money to make uh 

154.27 160.09 A: you know put it toward the federal government so they can use it toward the safety in the airplanes 

159.99 166.01 B: are are are you are you happy with the security that you're you're having with the liberty you're getting 

166.18 170.42 A: (( yeah i am but i think that the money could be better used than it's being used now [noise] [noise] )) 

170.96 173.31 B: you have a complaint 

173.02 173.72 A: (( uh )) 

174.67 179.05 A: (( i guess you'd call it a complaint i don't like the way that my money's being used by the federal government )) 

180.20 187.27 B: well i'd rather i'd rather use the money now than spend it later where to rebuild the the country that we we love so much 

187.44 195.30 B: i just think that that's a shame that uh we have to live in fear of somebody coming up and doing some harm to us 

195.57 202.07 B: i mean you can't you have to can't even go out of the house without locking your door now because you're afraid of what people's coming in and going to do something 

202.40 208.91 B: so i think we have to have all the security we have and that's why we have good police forces in the town and good 

208.15 214.93 A: that we definitely got that definitely got a good police force definitely got a good police see my girlfriend right my girlfriend works in the airport 

209.85 210.76 B: pardon 

214.85 219.53 A: and she was telling me she works in uh j._f._k. airport and she was telling me that like 

219.38 231.94 A: all the stuff we hear on t._v. about you know the they're catching this guy and they got she said that for everything that we hear about there's so many things that happen [noise] that we don't even hear about so i mean i think i don't think the security works 

231.79 246.66 A: as well as we think so i'm saying instead of spending of money to you know make bombs use that money for security but in another way like have better trained people working at like something's better than nothing but i just think they could do more do you not understand what i'm trying to say like i 

245.58 258.87 B: how long do you how long do you think it takes to to train a person to to uh look in a bag or use an instrument to find out if you have carrying any any uh drugs or anything like that doesn't take very long to teach somebody that does it 

258.44 261.76 A: no it doesn't but you know in countries like in um 

261.79 274.77 A: like in israel israel where they have a lot of you know bombings and stuff they they um they got all these expensive machines that they rub like you know a piece of paper on all over your clothes and everything and if they even 

262.14 262.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

273.35 277.12 B: so you're saying we should buy more machines and stop buying bombs 

277.08 282.00 A: right like like you know those machines that like pick up traces of like any kind of like 

280.26 286.44 B: well i hope i hope i hope that you you never have anybody any problem with anybody doing anything to you 

286.50 298.23 B: i i i just think that the the security that we have with that nine eleven incident that we had uh we need more security on that whether we have to spend money or what we have to do we're going to have to do it 

296.61 297.65 A: exactly 

298.47 300.18 A: exactly i agree with you there 

302.47 306.50 B: so that that's that's what i that's my opinion i i just think that 

306.36 320.12 B: security is uh uh liberty is not free and security is not free you gotta pay you say well instead of using bombs where do we use bombs we use bombs to help another country uh this this is fine this is what we have to do 

319.79 320.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

320.00 324.80 B: i i'm a retired military man myself and i know wherein i speak 

324.97 334.80 B: and i am i'll i'll do all the security i can to help this country of mine because it's the greatest country that we have and if people don't like it let them get the hell out 

325.22 326.13 A: (( oh )) 

332.16 333.71 A: see see the thing is 

334.57 342.55 A: see the thing no see i love this country but you know is like like you know you being in the military you know this is true as well like when wartimes happen we all 

342.69 348.00 A: we boast about how like how much we love our military our firefighters and all you know our 

348.11 361.21 A: uh police people but then when it comes time like september eleventh new york when it came time to do the budget the first people that lost their jobs were the firefighters and the police fighters the military doesn't get paid enough you know i think that's what they need to and and look people should 

359.89 362.90 B: are you registered are you registered to vote 

362.83 363.63 A: huh 

364.99 366.52 B: do you vote 

366.07 366.88 A: yeah 

366.97 371.56 B: well you better 'cause if you don't you don't have a right to speak on anything at all 

372.50 376.58 A: oh i vote i vote on everything from who's going to be on my town council to 

376.89 380.30 A: who's going to um to who uh voted for 

380.51 393.51 A: the presidential election i vote yeah i vote like 'cause i i you know me and my mom and dad and my sister we all vote 'cause i i you know all those people that they a lot of people that don't vote and they still bitch and complain about everything's that wrong 

382.09 383.27 B: yeah 

392.16 396.12 B: that that's a shame they have no right to complain if they don't go and vote 

393.65 394.53 A: that's just 

395.94 404.09 A: 'cause people you know quite frankly people die all over the world just to get right to be able to you know vote and then we got this right and then most of the people 

404.17 408.38 A: don't even do that right you know that they have they don't they don't vote for 

407.57 415.32 B: that's right oh i'm with you a hundred percent on that that's why i believe that we have too many people abusing the rights that they have 

415.39 424.17 B: and and uh if we need to pay more for security let's pay more for it because i don't want somebody breaking into my home i don't want somebody 

423.02 433.74 A: see that's see every like everybody wants some security but a lot of people i'm willing to pay the higher taxes but a lot of people don't want to pay the taxes and then when they don't want to pay the taxes obviously things are going to have to get cut you know [noise] 

430.27 431.14 B: well 

433.30 438.38 B: the ones that don't want to pay their taxes are probably the ones that are not working and living on the government anyhow 

439.84 444.58 B: they don't have to pay taxes the ones that are complaining they don't pay taxes 

444.81 445.62 A: mhm 

444.96 446.22 B: they're not working 

447.92 454.54 A: if they're not working they just need something to complain about they're just the people that need something to complain about doesn't really matter what it is 

447.93 448.67 B: (( see )) 

450.16 450.97 B: huh 

454.44 465.80 B: well i i have i have no complaints except that the more security we have the more i'm willing to pay for it i'm willing to pay for a guard to to guard my house if i had a a real expensive house 

454.57 456.00 A: (( they shouldn't com- )) 

465.75 477.18 B: uh i'm i'm willing to pay for that because it it we have taken for granted too many years the security the liberties that we have and the freedom that we have which we which we took 

474.94 476.19 A: we definitely have 

477.26 484.17 A: realize that it's not it's it's our right but to most to most of the people in the world it's a privilege 'cause not that many people have the right to we 

483.25 485.28 B: (( that's right most most people )) 

484.38 486.57 A: got a privilege to live in this country and then 

486.47 489.70 A: people want to bitch and complain about paying a little bit of extra money 

489.69 503.81 A: you know people in other countries die about die over trying to get food and 'cause they got the mil- government like killing people and not taking care of them properly we have that and people complain about not wanting to spend the money you know and you can't do that like if you want the security 

503.71 516.72 A: the money for it and it's you can't really blame the government on it too much because a lot of people try to you know even the lot of the rich people they try to they try to get out the little loopholes a lot of the companies do the same thing and you think then huh 

514.83 515.76 B: well 

516.51 529.67 B: yeah i i guess so i i'll tell you about i think though that we all have to wise up and and and be grateful for the wonderful country we have and thank god that if we haven't been attacked we're lucky 

529.67 536.69 B: and if and if we have to pay for security to make sure we're not attacked let's pay for it you know that's my my opinion 

530.10 531.16 A: mhm 

535.03 549.97 A: the other thing is the other is is after after nine eleven happened everybody's all uh all worried about security but i think since it's been almost two years people already are trying to forget about it ay because you know nothing's happened in a while we can't forget about it 'cause 

548.84 551.36 B: oh no we can't forget about security yet 

550.54 562.75 A: 'cause the first time you know the first time the world trade center thing happened for a while everybody you know when they got bombed like in ninety one for like two three years we worried about it and then we stopped worrying about it and then you know something like this happened we've stopped worrying about it now [noise] 

560.31 561.59 B: yeah but you see 

562.08 575.48 B: you see what's happened we've gone along for years and years and years i'm eighty years old and i i remember i don't remember ever worrying about anybody coming in and doing any harm to me or my country 

575.48 588.32 A: right now yeah exactly like last time anything like this happened to us was probably back in like pearl harbor i guess you know being attacked from in a non uh in a non wartime any any like u._s. civilians being attacked [noise] [noise] 

575.65 576.44 B: (( but )) 

586.98 599.89 B: yeah but what i'm saying is that we took so much for granted we didn't appreciate the liberties and now that we're losing our our freedom we're we're being have having to uh have check in at the airport like your girlfriend does and stuff like that they have to check
