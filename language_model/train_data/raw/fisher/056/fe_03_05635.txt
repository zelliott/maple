5.90 7.02 A: how you doing 

7.18 9.61 B: pretty good so airport security 

9.47 14.74 A: ah yeah is does it ah does it lessen the chance of terrorism in the skies 

14.71 16.46 B: (( ah )) 

16.72 23.63 B: maybe it lessens the chance of terrorism in the skies but ah it probably doesn't lessen the chance of terrorism overall it 

23.37 32.72 A: no it definitely doesn't i'm sure it i'm sure it helps i mean the fact that there's you know it it makes a difference as far as [sigh] planes blowing up or not if if they you know [sigh] 

31.72 45.62 B: yeah but it's like well even that it's like if somebody's actually gonna blow up a plane they're just gonna think of another way to do it you can we- weaknesses are available to the ah to the hunter not to the ah the hunted so it's just like well i mean look somebody could drive their car out 

45.72 54.80 B: ah you know strapped with bombs and crash down a fence on the on the runway and blow it up right on the runway or or use a surface to air missile or use a b. fifty seven as it takes off 

50.93 52.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

52.58 58.55 A: yeah that that's that's the big one is like the surface to air one sure yeah it's definitely 

55.43 56.27 B: (( yeah or )) 

57.15 67.45 B: it's like if somebody and and if somebody wants to kill themselves if they're willing to die like we can't stop 'em the only thing that can stop 'em is like if they don't wanna do it it's just like 

67.63 75.46 B: i mean ninety percent of the time that's gonna be the case i mean they got lucky catching those columbine kids there's that [mn] that latest pair that 

70.00 71.36 A: yeah 

74.42 76.33 A: [sigh] oh the jersey ones yeah [noise] 

75.51 82.50 B: yeah the jersey jersey columbine kids but i mean it's just how it goes you gotta deal with things at the root you can't 

82.53 86.80 B: you can't i mean you can't expect to win all the time with ah you 

86.97 89.64 B: know trimming things at the top so 

89.22 94.59 A: [sigh] yeah yeah i i agree but ah you know i guess if i took a a flight i would ah 

94.50 98.80 B: yeah i i fly all the time actually so it's like i'm ah 

95.08 95.91 A: i 

100.77 111.90 B: yeah i mean i i'm glad for the security you know i'm glad to have heightened airport security it's not i don't really you know bitch a whole lot when you know i have to wait in line to take off my shoes it's 

105.69 106.83 A: yeah 

111.37 122.38 A: well american ones definitely the american ah terminals have always been far more lax than european ones or let's say like heathrow in particular has always been the most locked down [sigh] kind of airport heathrow [mn] 

120.16 121.22 B: which one 

122.72 129.44 B: oh oh yeah well there you can they've always they've been de- dealing with like you know i._r._a. terrorism for a while right so it's like 

125.68 128.20 A: yeah they've been dealing with it for a while 

129.30 140.60 B: you know if [mn] they never had to really deal with it here but i mean again i i still think that it's like you know it's kinda like as far as you know big terrorist actions it's not gonna 

140.98 141.96 B: ah 

142.70 146.29 B: do you know do a whole lot because it's just like 

146.50 152.54 B: it's already been done it's like they they'll never even if you could get on a plane and try to hijack it like everybody would just jump you 

152.34 153.41 A: yeah 

153.15 162.91 B: you know it's like you could never pull it off again it's like it worked that one time they had surprise the people out there probably flying to you know some other country and then they'd be like 

161.00 169.17 A: yeah or they felt it was you know it was political and well well not political but money related i mean that they would get money [mn] you'd ah [mn] 

164.16 165.72 B: yeah yeah 

168.71 175.53 B: right right exactly or just political like ransom like old old school style you know you ransom off your hostages 

175.03 180.94 A: yeah you would always you would assume it's about money but if it's you know so it's like a passionate thing that you would kill yourself over then 

175.72 177.31 B: or you or you 

178.29 179.18 B: yeah 

181.08 183.63 A: [sigh] yeah then there's not much to do to prevent it 

181.28 182.51 B: yeah 

183.01 185.95 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

184.99 186.97 A: so you you fly all the time 

186.58 191.32 B: [noise] well i fly a fair amount between ah jersey and new york and florida 

190.95 192.50 A: oh right 

192.23 193.92 B: so where are you at 

193.34 195.28 A: i live in new york in manhattan 

195.33 197.21 B: oh really huh 

196.11 202.65 A: yeah so i ah i when was the last flight i don't fly too much anymore just just for vacations but ah 

202.78 203.89 B: yeah 

204.23 212.00 A: but um but yeah it's you know security [mn] obviously it it helps but there's no ah i've never i'll never 

212.02 217.92 A: feel a hundred percent safe but it's not like i feel scared but ah [mn] i'll never know i'm secure 

215.50 222.80 B: yeah i mean like yeah it's like it's like again if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen it's like if somebody wants to 

223.06 227.21 B: kill themselves it's like their options are pretty wide open 

226.43 230.55 A: [laughter] yeah 

227.23 242.13 B: to how they can do it you know what i mean i mean that's it's like if like i said they could drive a van right out through the airport right onto the you know the terminal as a pl- you know and a plane's loaded with fuel all it has to do is ignite you know ignite the the fuel and the plane's gonna blow up so 

242.86 249.00 A: 'cause in in in africa is where they had the surface to air missile i think it missed a plane wasn't there one that 

242.95 244.49 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

249.36 256.67 B: yeah i mean the technology for that is weaker i mean because the people who basically develop technology are ah 

256.75 257.72 B: (( you know )) 

257.76 261.49 B: the bombers you know they'll the the like surface to air missiles developed 

261.75 274.32 B: ah in in force in during the vietnam war because the you know the soviets had at least a little bit of money to help develop it it's like you know people at m._i._t. aren't busy developing a weapon to shoot down b. fifty twos 

274.57 284.18 B: ah they're just [laughter] they develop weapons that drop bombs from b. fifty twos you know onto buildings it's not it doesn't work the other way around and so technology you know takes 

279.59 280.96 A: yeah 

284.09 290.17 B: time money investment and waste to develop i mean that's how things get done so 

290.24 303.72 B: the surface to air missile stuff is like it's it's it's a credible threat but i think it's a more likely threat to work like on a runway it's it's if it's very hard they don't have like serviced air missiles that can shoot a plane down like high up in the sky 

303.56 304.40 A: (( no )) 

304.11 310.06 B: ah especially like f- like most of the missiles are what they call fire and forget it's like you just you kinda aim 'em and they 

309.97 321.43 B: kinda can go and some of them are like heat seeking but like the [mn] the ones that the the only good ones are like the sights which is like not you can't it's not feasible you need like a whole 

321.39 325.66 B: they cost a lot and they have to be like planted in the ground and stuff like that so 

324.63 329.93 A: [noise] [noise] yeah but e- but even like the fire and forget ones like a grenade launcher you know could be 

328.14 335.67 B: sure sure like on the ground like on the ground outside of a runway yeah absolutely like that can easily easily hit 

333.72 338.18 A: and even like even a broken tyre can bring down a plane like the concorde 

336.90 337.91 B: right 

338.00 339.18 B: right 

338.57 340.70 A: which was my my favorite plane 

341.12 342.10 B: [laughter] 

341.76 343.03 A: (( [sigh] but ah )) 

342.39 344.08 B: yeah 

343.05 344.99 A: and it just had it's last ah 

345.12 346.34 A: last run 

346.95 352.66 B: yeah i i don't kn- i don't know [mn] i think ten minutes is too long for airport security it should of given a bigger 

352.99 355.16 B: bigger topic [laughter] 

354.25 358.96 A: [laughter] and ah you know they should of they ah 

356.86 357.97 B: (( i don't )) 

358.99 367.30 A: i wonder exactly what they're looking for too whatever that studies is the ah you know they'll say that this is what they're after but it's always something else it's funny 

359.23 359.81 B: (( know )) 

361.44 362.72 B: (( yeah i think )) 

367.13 371.72 B: oh for psychol- yeah if it's a psychology thing it's just like oh um

380.97 389.75 B: [laughter] like what do you remember you know 'cause it'll be like the extraneous information like that's always the psych psych projects i do 'cause i you know 

384.65 385.66 A: [laughter] 

390.13 392.28 B: (( do 'em as often as i can 'cause i can't )) 

392.34 393.84 B: can't find a job

428.55 431.37 A: [laughter] yeah 

429.39 436.85 B: yeah hopefully they're not like applying for credit 'cause you never know i mean there was also a kid at a college who like started up a fake airline 

436.87 443.45 B: and was like offering tickets tickets to hawaii for eighty nine dollars and like he just pocketed the money there was like no airline [laughter] 

437.04 438.85 A: (( yeah )) 

442.72 444.33 A: [laughter] 

444.15 445.96 B: (( but it's like )) 

445.04 449.34 A: but i just how does he like i just wonder how he imagined to get away with it all for ah 

449.43 454.23 A: for so long or like in the end ultimately how would you ever get away with it 

450.06 451.01 B: well 

451.11 452.15 B: yeah like 

452.24 453.71 B: yeah 

454.29 462.14 B: right i mean you'd think you could just ah he would just have done it you know once and then taken the money and ran but 

462.43 466.42 B: oh well i don't know people are curious try that try that kind of 

466.93 470.62 B: stuff but back to airport security ah 

469.27 470.17 A: (( yeah )) 

470.42 478.35 A: yeah i also think the workers i mean we pay you know these minimum wage guys that are men and women that you know 

470.82 472.28 B: it's ah 

477.73 485.46 B: oh they ch they changed that they they they federalized it so it's like they don't have the the minimum wage people anymore it's not like it yeah it is 

483.06 487.89 A: oh that's great government workers really give a shit about all the things that they do too 

487.19 493.21 B: well they do but there's a thing about government workers though is they have to follow protocol whereas like business workers 

491.12 492.28 A: yeah 

493.03 500.36 B: the business has a single role of profit in mind i mean that's why the government that's why government workers are can be very beneficial 

500.13 506.05 B: it's like you sometimes you just don't need to put a price tag on it and you simply need to have a job done 

505.97 517.61 B: efficient like done well even if it's not efficient like basically and and i haven't had much problems like going through security recently it's pret- it's been pretty fast 

516.95 522.22 A: no i get annoyed with the ah the drop off and pick ups so you ah you can't 

517.75 518.97 B: (( yeah like )) 

521.69 524.54 B: yeah that's a little ridiculous yeah it's a little ridiculous 

522.84 523.91 A: anymore 

524.30 528.31 A: because like a car bomb going off so far away from any plane like 

524.65 525.56 B: (( yeah i mean )) 

526.31 527.45 B: right 

528.37 535.69 A: like you know the your athletic events you can still tailgate or you know there's tonnes of places to to blow up and it's just ah it's annoying to 

532.93 534.12 B: yeah 

535.01 542.08 B: yeah but those it's like the terrorist targets are are commerce targets they're not like i mean that's what people said like oh if they 

542.25 548.36 B: you know if they really wanted to try to kill a lot of people they would of done it on a sunday and crashed into ah you know football stadiums 

547.84 553.43 A: yeah or if they wanted to kill people they would of crashed you know a half hour later and they would have gotten twice as many people [sigh] 

551.74 552.62 B: yeah 

552.80 560.45 B: right exactly or or done that exactly i mean but but like think of a football stadium it's got like fifty thousand people in each stadium you could just 

558.69 564.78 A: yeah well i went i went to michigan we have like a hundred and tw- the biggest stadium in united states like a hundred and twenty thousand now [mn] 

563.05 564.12 B: right 

564.21 578.76 B: yeah exactly i mean you'd just destroy like everything if you crash a plane in there there's just there's [mn] you know the protection nobody has anything [mn] yeah that'd be a mess it'd be a mess so yeah i mean i know what you mean like driving up on the outside of the ah [mn] 

579.24 593.77 A: it it's actually dangerous the and i only went to pick up a a parent maybe like a week ago and since you can't wait outside i didn't want to park the car so i kind of waited on the the exit ramp from the expressway to the philadelphia airport 

587.97 588.80 B: yeah 

590.68 591.61 B: yeah 

593.64 599.89 A: and there were like thirty other cars all waiting there you know and they're waiting to get a call from the cellphone or whoever they're picking up [mn] 

596.73 597.96 B: (( yeah yeah mhm ))
