110.23 115.31 B: yeah but it it's gotten out of hand i don't know 

115.55 117.20 B: greed has gotten 

118.21 123.32 B: more of i guess everybody's morals than than anything else [cough] 

123.61 131.36 B: now it's just now it's just the domino effect everybody wants to do the same thing you know ah apartment complexes they're 

127.53 128.56 A: right 

131.50 135.60 B: doubling you know i mean charging way too much way too much more than they should 

137.32 138.63 A: yeah 

138.56 144.59 B: but as far as i guess we're supposed to talk about the strike on the sports but [laughter] 

142.88 146.24 A: what's the rules we're supposed to talk about the high salaries too 

145.99 153.02 B: yeah yeah ah it must be nice you know [laughter] but ah 

151.07 151.99 A: right 

153.09 157.15 B: no i i don't think it's i don't think it's worthy ah 

159.41 160.37 B: it's 

160.60 166.61 B: i mean jeeze i could go out there and play too just with a little bit of practice a little bit of coaching but you know why so many millions 

166.84 179.86 A: right well actually it's pretty hard to do that i think because these players that play they they have to play some time and prove their worth and then they have to be injury free almost to draw it 

179.17 181.34 B: right and that's the thing um 

181.67 185.98 A: then they have to make the contract pay the agent 

185.89 187.62 B: yeah 

186.20 188.87 A: maybe move to another city 

188.84 190.32 B: mhm 

189.87 193.13 A: (( and break up their home and everything else )) 

193.08 193.90 B: (( for i )) 

193.83 194.85 A: just for 

194.30 199.28 B: mean just for the minor alone i suppose they're they're moving a whole lot but ah 

198.45 200.34 A: yeah 

199.58 200.54 B: (( you know )) 

201.21 201.96 A: (( rod- )) 

202.05 204.18 A: (( rodriguez in texas )) 

204.14 205.01 B: mhm 

204.29 207.95 A: he's making twenty five million a year for nine years is it 

207.42 210.40 B: [laughter] insane 

210.02 213.57 A: [laughter] and then they use it as a there 

212.98 215.49 B: [laughter] 

215.86 219.59 A: i would think they should have some sort of accountability i 

219.12 228.94 B: that's it you know i mean what i mean [laughter] oh my gosh 

228.46 231.78 A: suppose you could compare it to some business executives 

231.57 234.47 B: right well see that's the thing you know i mean 

234.69 238.79 B: it seems like somehow or another there should be kind of a boundary as far as 

238.90 252.07 B: ah you know sports incomes as opposed to you know hard working you know business types or or any other hardworking individual i mean it's just it's it's it's way preposterous how much money they're making and movie stars too 

251.85 257.28 B: but um i i just don't know how it got on such a grand scale all of a sudden i i don't i 

256.12 257.10 A: yeah 

257.91 259.57 A: right 

258.88 261.49 B: (( don't i don't know where that came from and then all of a sudden it )) 

261.76 265.46 B: you know and everybody started wanting multi million dollar contracts 

266.36 267.31 A: right 

266.53 273.64 B: gee you know [laughter] first it was tennis or something or other i don't know god who who knows but ah 

267.53 268.73 A: right 

273.80 275.70 B: back in my day it wasn't that way 

275.42 276.49 A: no 

276.42 281.72 B: so i mean i'm not that old but jeeze [laughter] i wish i was stuck with something 

280.14 286.73 A: i think the highest paid baseball player twenty years ago was making a million dollars a year 

285.97 288.36 B: who would have thought 

287.13 288.53 A: twenty years ago 

288.38 292.22 B: yeah i mean hockey players especially because that sport was so 

292.69 299.80 B: i mean it wasn't you know no no real media coverage whatsoever and then ah with the last ten or fifteen years all of a sudden you see hockey all over the place it's 

296.03 297.01 A: yeah 

298.97 300.08 A: cable 

300.04 308.15 B: yeah yeah i mean thank goodness i mean that's my favorite sport but ah you know it i don't know just ah

325.66 326.97 A: gee whiz 

326.15 327.62 B: it's like but 

328.80 330.79 B: (( i )) 

331.49 333.61 B: think he's he's the most

336.84 337.90 A: yeah 

337.35 348.94 B: because only because he was so good and he [laughter] could basically get it out of these franchises or what have you that that he's worked with and and you know set the standard for you know other other teams to 

343.58 344.49 A: right
