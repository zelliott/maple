0.57 1.98 B: my name's tom 

1.86 3.06 A: i'm mike 

3.02 3.93 B: hey mike 

3.92 4.82 A: (( how are you doing )) 

4.53 6.22 B: good 

5.62 8.13 A: i'm from allentown right out in pennsylvania 

8.33 9.71 B: i'm from philadelphia 

10.08 11.57 A: (( all right um )) 

12.07 16.00 A: so what the topic was professional athletes and ah their strikes 

15.44 23.07 B: strikes yeah i think it's ridiculous actually [laughter] um especially the amount of money they get paid um 

23.36 28.41 B: i guess if the owners are going to give them money um they certainly 

28.80 29.62 B: (( you know )) 

29.75 39.44 B: have every right to get everything they can but the fact that you know the average fan is going and spending so much money at the baseball park or wherever sport it is 

39.78 49.13 B: um i think they have to have some loyalty to ah you know to the fans because they just really when it comes down to it they really don't seem to care too much about them it's just all about the money 

49.30 51.40 A: it's in any professional now 

51.87 53.43 A: why should that be any different 

54.38 57.36 B: that's true but millions and millions of dollars 

57.38 62.67 B: to just to play baseball and and because maybe they don't they're not getting enough or they're not getting 

69.40 72.22 A: (( ridiculous it's an entertainment )) 

72.23 85.05 B: sure it is um but it just ah doesn't really make the fans feel any better doesn't it certainly keeps the fans away from the ball park um and who who pays the salaries who who who are paying these owners and who are paying these salaries the fans are 

85.42 91.75 B: if ah players continue to strike you'll definitely see less and less fans at each of these games unless unless sport's being played 

91.70 102.40 B: ah it's going to happen this year in hockey and basketball ah there're going to be lockouts and so forth and ah you know baseball that that happens more than ev- ah more than in any other sport 

102.73 108.24 B: you know less and less fans go to the park and you'll see less and less ah less and less of these big salaries being paid out 

107.32 109.57 A: baseball i agree about but 

109.65 111.81 A: (( i )) 

113.19 119.60 B: hockey really hasn't seen much of this yet but i think hockey salaries are starting to get really out of hand and ah 

113.23 114.40 A: don't think you 

119.61 124.54 B: and i know this year because i'm a hockey fan i know something's coming up this year where either the ah 

124.83 126.90 B: there's going to be some type of um 

126.83 140.34 B: strike or lock out or something like that and ah they're trying to put a cap i think on salaries or just lower them because they were getting out of hand and ah that that leads to strikes i mean not that that's the subject but it leads still leads to that so 

140.67 146.82 B: um i'm a big fan of hockey and i know if the if the players went on strike as a fan i'd 

146.79 160.77 B: it would take me a while to to come back and start watching it again it'd just turn me off and ah you know i'm i'm not alone there i think a lot of fans get turned off by that and they stop paying these high prices to go see these players play 

163.20 165.86 A: (( know a hundred and )) 

169.74 171.05 A: (( twenty five dollars )) 

171.10 172.78 B: yeah 

173.92 175.89 B: (( right i know ah )) 

176.54 179.56 B: i certainly can't afford that right now and um 

179.82 181.42 B: with ah you know 

181.92 189.87 B: i don't know like i live in the city now so i know like we're we're going to be moving um so i know like there's other my my point is 

190.01 200.02 B: there are other priorities in people's lives than than going to you know going to see sports and you know one of the things you sacrifice is the entertainment you mentioned that earlier entertainment it is strictly entertainment 

200.07 205.51 B: and ah you know that certainly you know i wouldn't miss it you know that much so 

205.71 207.28 B: (( but ah )) 

207.44 208.94 B: (( you know sorry i kind of )) 

209.05 209.86 A: (( for )) 

210.22 214.37 A: i don't think i don't think the athletes deserve it any less than movie stars do 

214.45 219.13 B: true that that is true ah movie stars [laughter] same thing you 

219.14 225.11 A: you have no problem you never hear people complain about their salaries and everything it's always it's always 

223.56 225.82 B: (( know you're you're )) 

225.39 226.42 A: (( sports )) 

226.12 236.74 B: right people really don't think about it you know as much as sports because you know not that they don't get the attention but just sports seems to whenever the players strike it's always 

236.57 243.62 B: front page news and all that stuff and you don't really i don't know i don't know about movie stars strikes and things like that like ah 

243.72 247.54 B: i i i know the salaries are ridiculous but um 

247.69 261.93 B: you know you don't see them going on strike too often and and they don't seem to those unions don't seem to hold their guys together as much as like say the the baseball union does or any other any any other sports do 

262.27 265.76 B: you know there's more people inclined to cross the picket line 

266.40 268.97 B: you know as an actor or actress 

269.96 274.08 B: um but ah you know overall i just ah 

274.55 275.34 B: (( you know )) 

275.64 283.47 B: like i said just get turned off by it if if it occurs and i know and just a lot of friends and family and stuff like that who won't they won't watch baseball 

282.28 286.02 A: (( yeah )) 

285.61 286.64 B: i'm sorry 

288.07 293.24 A: baseball had their strike a couple of years back and i think fans were definitely were definitely turned off too 

292.79 305.26 B: oh yeah and like i said as i was getting too friends and family who they will not watch a baseball game go to a baseball game because of that and i think overall [laughter] out of all the sports those salaries are the most ridiculous and um 

305.77 310.94 B: definitely out of like you know because people just get so jaded by it they're like man uh-huh 

312.08 314.02 A: with other sports as well and 

313.50 315.14 B: yeah 

314.41 315.52 A: (( their salaries )) 

315.24 317.65 B: certainly yeah so 

318.31 325.70 B: um so that's my that's my thoughts [laughter] i don't know if i have much else but and i don't know if that was worth ten minutes ten minutes worth 

325.79 327.33 B: (( [laughter] um )) 

327.78 329.08 B: you know um 

329.24 330.04 B: (( don )) 

330.74 344.65 B: i i myself actually i'm going to see a baseball game this weekend in new york so and i'm paying sixty bucks for a bus a ticket and everything and ah i know if this was like a you know a recent strike or a pending strike i know i wouldn't be going 

345.03 348.10 B: um i'd just totally be turned off by that 

348.01 348.85 A: mhm 

349.73 350.65 B: so 

351.21 357.19 B: i don't know it took me a while to come back from the last one it took me about three years before i started watching baseball again 

357.35 359.47 B: or even start to care about it 

359.85 362.92 B: (( and there's too many other things happening to um )) 

363.63 369.61 B: you know to worry about that and to you know to even pay any attention to it or put any more money in their pockets so 

370.28 371.53 B: it just really it 

372.00 373.62 B: just really turns me off 

373.78 374.68 B: so 

375.63 376.55 B: um 

377.37 380.84 B: that's all i have to say really so any comments [laughter] 

382.35 384.16 A: (( like you when you said )) 

383.86 385.71 B: yeah 

386.63 391.61 A: i i think some sport like baseball i think it's definitely the salaries are 

393.41 395.53 A: like you said about loyalty ah 

396.26 398.32 A: some of the players i mean they'll go 

398.37 403.42 A: when they're making a hundred and eighty million if someone were to offer them a hundred and twenty for a team they've i mean 

403.85 410.36 A: they they'll go for that for that little extra money they don't they don't care about the fans or anything 

409.96 410.75 B: (( hm )) 

410.97 411.96 B: that's true 

412.60 418.21 B: yeah customer well customer loyalty fan loyalty is really another thing you know there's not really um 

418.65 419.93 B: the team is 

420.03 422.12 B: you know small market teams 

422.17 427.09 B: aren't as successful as large market teams these days 'cause they just can't pay those big salaries 

427.33 434.53 B: and that that's true in any sport i think and um and there really is no loyalty in in i 

435.00 438.77 B: don't know if it's you know i'm sure the player's associations are out there saying you know 

438.99 444.06 B: get what you can get because you're really only in the sport for i think the average 

444.07 450.61 B: average lifespan or of like a professional sports player whatever sport it is is like maybe ten years 

450.91 464.60 B: so they got to get what they can get and and that's what they're thinking about they're not really thinking about oh i'd love to stay in philadelphia i'm not going to leave there you know it's my ah it's the only place i want to play and i i'll take a pay cut you never hear a player saying that [laughter] if you do it's like 

464.58 465.98 B: you know one in a million 

466.13 466.98 B: (( so )) 

467.07 474.06 B: and ah and all of them are in line with the strikes you know there's there's not many at all that um would even think about 

474.12 474.98 B: you know 

475.26 481.03 B: um not striking nor crossing the picket line they'd be blackballed you know from the sport forever and from their 

481.28 484.19 B: you know um co-players and so forth 

484.67 485.50 B: um 

485.78 489.20 B: so fan loyalty definitely out of the question it doesn't happen [laughter] 

489.44 490.23 B: so 

490.92 492.55 B: it's all it's all about the money 

493.47 494.54 A: absolutely 

494.32 496.20 B: yeah 

495.14 497.18 A: that is that is society though 

497.91 499.63 B: yeah 

498.74 499.96 A: because i mean 

500.99 509.30 A: some some i think it's just it really is not the money i don't think you would care about the loyalty but it's the amount of money that they make 

508.81 510.77 B: yeah 

509.85 512.43 A: and for what they do for how much they actually work 

512.02 520.23 B: [laughter] exactly you don't even mention movie movie stars also you know the same thing it's like ah it may take a month to shoot a film 

520.07 532.25 B: and you know a month's work for you know jim carey twenty million dollars a film plus royalties it's amazing [laughter] you know i'd never have to work a day another day in my life if i just got that but you know it's um 

532.14 535.42 B: they'll continue to get those you know the big bucks and um 

535.92 538.86 B: you know people will continue to pay and 

538.37 541.68 A: well pitchers in baseball i mean they don't it's not like they 

542.01 544.06 A: they don't have a game every day and 

543.66 544.69 B: that's true 

544.47 546.61 A: they play one in seven games 

545.86 553.02 B: yeah yeah they're playing ah you know every what is it five five man rotation mostly and ah so they're playing like every five six days 

553.22 557.49 B: and they're they're the ones getting the really big salaries the pitchers and um 

557.48 572.41 B: the guy who played for the philly's a couple of years ago was andy ashby he he stunk i think he won like maybe one game out of like fifteen he was so bad but he went he got traded to like l._a. or something like that or that's where he came from and you know he got a he got a raise you know 

572.53 575.64 B: he got a raise it sounds ridiculous [laughter] 

575.90 578.08 B: you know and then they're gonna they're gonna strike 

578.16 579.37 B: (( it's you know )) 

580.87 583.58 B: that that makes me sick so you know just ah 

583.78 593.82 B: being a bad like it's like being em- it's like being bad employee being transferred getting a raise and then if i'm not happy with the salary saying you know what i'm going to sit this out until they give me more so 

594.10 599.99 B: he's not happy with that especially like to the hard you know to the blue collar well whatever you are blue collar white collar
