0.00 3.38 A: hi my name is scott glazier from massachusetts 

2.76 7.85 B: [noise] hi my name is ken newell i'm down in uh florida gainesville florida 

7.15 8.70 A: hi nice to meet you 

8.27 9.83 B: you too [laughter] 

9.19 11.85 A: so shall we talk about this [laughter] 

11.24 13.43 B: airport security 

12.77 15.18 A: yeah this is my first time doing this so 

14.97 16.90 B: do you travel much 

16.36 23.13 A: um i do actually um i go to school in chicago um actually evanston uh northwestern university so 

22.11 23.85 B: so what's your experience 

23.51 24.76 A: i'm sorry 

24.14 28.25 B: so what's your experience with the uh airlines and going through security 

27.65 39.44 A: well it seems that everytime i'm in boston um which is where i'm uh where i fly out of um security is tight since um september eleventh actually orig- well i mean one of the flights originated from boston 

38.75 40.12 B: oh that's right 

39.56 53.21 A: um but whenever i'm in chicago it's a breeze to get through um and actually i feel safer with the security than when i did before i feel as though now it's a lot safer to fly than it ever was in the past 

52.67 54.74 B: so you don't feel hassled by it at all 

54.27 64.64 A: um not really like 'cause i get to the airport relatively early i'd rather be safe and spend an extra hour you know making sure things are okay than to regret it later 

64.32 73.63 B: but what about all those uh incidents you hear about where they breached the security where somebody carried a gun onboard and they didn't discover it until they got off or somebody had a knife 

72.46 76.72 A: yeah no that's actually a really good point but um even so 

76.83 84.09 A: like i guess it's still better than it was in the past though you do make a good point obviously there is room for improvement 

84.13 85.79 A: do you travel a lot 

85.55 88.82 B: i i uh when i travel i go overseas 

88.19 89.36 A: oh really 

88.75 90.70 B: so i was already used to 

90.71 95.84 B: most of the security procedures that they've implemented because traveling overseas 

95.85 108.63 B: uh they ask you a lot of questions uh where you're going who had your bag last uh who packed your bags do you own everything in your bag do you have anything that looks like a weapon guns scissors hairdryer 

100.30 101.52 A: (( [noise] )) 

108.51 116.07 B: you know and you have to tell them everything and then they inspect your documents very carefully your passport and your tickets and they match up 

110.36 111.44 A: right 

116.08 125.65 B: names and things and for a while i had a problem because my my first name is really oron but i don't use it much because people don't get it but they get ken 

125.53 137.06 B: my my middle name is kenneth so i use ken and a lot of times when i made my reservations i made my name you know ken newell but on my passport it has my full name of course 

127.24 128.16 A: uh-huh 

136.44 137.57 A: i see 

137.04 147.40 B: so the passport name wouldn't match up exactly with the uh [laughter] name on the ticket and uh right after nine eleven i got hassled on that twice 

146.79 148.27 A: oh right 

147.60 149.13 B: (( yes )) 

148.51 150.81 A: and i'm sure that's a bother to you 

150.23 158.92 B: it it was it was a little bit of a bother because i had to go you know i'm a computer type and i have you know i make my reservations online and i have 

158.30 159.70 A: yeah as do i 

158.76 168.38 B: frequent flyer club so i had to go and change my name on my frequent flyer membership it was uh it was quite a quite a lot to do for for a little while 

167.65 176.49 A: yeah but did you find it's like worth it though like i mean i mean even though they ask all these questions and what not it like makes the trip a little safer 

178.20 185.00 B: you know i i have mixed feelings on it i i'm an older person so i don't i don't like to be hassled too much 

181.64 182.73 A: yeah 

184.62 189.24 A: that's understandable yeah and see like you're in a different situation than i am i 

185.32 187.20 B: yeah 

188.23 194.44 B: and it used to be where you would uh you know go get on a airplane like you went to get on a city bus 

193.95 194.99 A: right 

194.36 203.31 B: and now days you know you every time you go to get to uh go on an airplane it's a it's a major it's a major thing you you have to spend an hour 

203.38 214.38 B: just uh preparing for it another hour you know going through the security process uh and another you know if you got an hour flight it almost makes sense to uh drive instead of flying 

213.70 217.48 A: right well i mean it is safer to fly than drive 

217.59 220.38 B: oh definite what safer to fly than drive 

219.72 226.24 A: yeah like there's been more deaths um from car accidents than from plane crashes 

226.03 228.04 B: well of course yeah 

227.41 236.16 A: so it it i mean it seem and plus with the security i think it's safer to fly than drive but it is also most of the time more expensive 

236.18 238.59 A: um to fly 

238.23 239.04 B: right 

238.36 253.04 A: i mean as you said it ta i mean when you just go out and drive you know you can just leave whenever you want but you know when you have an airplane you have like a scheduled time you have to get ready you know take take into consideration everything that's going on in the airport and at home 

245.51 246.82 B: right 

252.84 255.95 B: and i i think i heard also that most of the uh 

254.18 255.38 A: [noise] 

255.73 266.33 B: you know they call them airport incursions or or uh security incursions when they happen and most of the ones that i've read about or heard about have always been 

266.18 277.55 B: uh uh except for the the few that where like the guy carried the gun through and they didn't find it till afterwards uh but except for those few the incursions have been from airport employees 

277.60 278.87 A: really 

278.23 283.46 B: from hand baggage handlers uh from uh undocumented workers 

282.80 284.86 A: yeah so it could be a lot of sleepers 

284.70 287.07 B: ye- ye- yeah exactly so 

286.41 287.20 A: yeah 

286.92 295.47 B: you know that's why i i really don't know that you know frisking all the passengers and uh putting the passengers through those kinds of uh 

295.31 302.24 B: ex- you know sometimes embarrassing uh checks you know take your shoes off you know what if you got a hole in your sock 

302.19 303.17 A: right 

302.56 304.27 B: you know that's kind of embarrassing yeah 

303.91 305.30 A: that's a good point 

304.73 306.01 B: [laughter] 

305.32 312.72 A: now now what out of all these like incursions that you've heard of what race have the people been just out of curiosity 

313.08 320.26 B: i usually don't pay much attention to race but being in florida the cur- incursions at miami for instance were uh hispanic 

320.09 321.16 A: yeah 

320.55 322.96 B: and caribbean uh 

323.22 324.88 B: descent 

323.29 334.40 A: 'cause i was going to say if the incursions were uh i mean it's obvious what type of race that the people in airport security are looking for um because like i i've realize that i i you know 

334.22 340.89 A: sometimes they'll take random people and like really examine them you know check all their all the stuff in their baggage 

340.82 346.51 A: and the majority of the people they check happen to be dark skin looking like middle eastern individuals 

345.65 347.50 B: (( [noise] yes i can [noise] )) 

346.44 359.59 A: and and because of like me for example i i'm i'm jewish um really dark skinned a lot of facial hair like a lot of people think that i'm from uh a middle eastern country so often i get um i get stopped 

359.34 361.64 B: you get looked at because of that yeah 

360.14 373.49 A: yeah but like i mean so that's why i was considering whether or not the incursions were uh people of the middle eastern race or dark skinned or just not or were they white caucasian people that you wouldn't expect to do anything 

372.49 384.04 B: yes yeah well i my uh my partner is a muslim and he has he used to wear a dark beard uh pretty long beard uh and he shaved it as a result of nine eleven 

376.37 377.37 A: uh-huh 

383.37 385.55 A: right which is unfortunate 

385.57 392.67 A: um but a lot i mean i think ever since then a lot of people have had to change their ways especially you know 

385.76 388.29 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

392.26 397.04 B: i think it's made quite an impact on uh on all of the people in the united states 

396.06 401.04 A: so like do you think something else should have been done instead of all this tight security 

400.77 405.68 B: [noise] what else could that's the question what else could could they have done uh what else could they do 

402.27 403.73 A: yeah exactly 

405.25 406.45 A: right 

405.83 412.95 B: you know uh yeah i don't know [noise] you know and we don't know what the [noise] expense is either oh sorry about that 

412.24 413.91 A: [laughter] no problem 

413.34 416.29 B: uh we don't know what the expense is either so 

416.21 421.24 B: you know the real question is if we had full disclosure of everything uh 

421.23 431.37 B: you know could it be done a different way uh i don't know do we have to trust our government officials to tell us this is the most the least expensive way and the highest security you can get 

431.55 439.27 A: well like i don't know from my high school background my college background from everything i've learnt it's very difficult to trust the government 

438.76 439.94 B: yes 

439.45 442.70 A: and to trust anything that people tell you so 

442.41 448.53 B: yes yeah and the the fact that we don't know what the security costs and i know that security costs are high 

449.31 456.24 B: uh actually we should take questions we should take uh guidance from from israel because they they've had the most secure airline 

456.28 460.37 B: uh travel from from every point in the world 

459.57 461.28 A: right el al right 

460.63 472.71 B: yeah el al yeah they they really know how to do it and uh i don't think that those passengers really go through well they go through scrutiny but they go through scrutiny from the time the ticket is purchased 

463.34 464.33 A: right 

472.36 473.32 A: right 

472.66 479.00 B: you know they they start seeing who this person is they they don't do a background check but they make sure that it's a real person and that they can 

479.10 491.92 B: uh you know they know where they are who they are and things like that i think with the terrorists you know you don't know who they are or where they are and and if you try to do some some check on them you you you would find some fuzzy information 

482.26 483.43 A: right yeah 

491.44 492.71 A: that's true 

492.48 496.62 B: and didn't they say that those terrorists bought their money their their tickets with cash too 

497.20 500.17 A: i don't know honestly 

499.76 501.32 B: yeah i don't remember that 

500.65 508.69 A: and like even if they did say that like i mean as i said it i find it very hard to believe anything our government says 

507.94 509.65 B: (( [mn] [noise] yeah [laughter] [noise] )) 

508.72 520.90 A: and like esp- especially with iraq i know it's not really the topic of conversation but how there's been all these like issues from the c._i._a. saying that they warned the united states not to make these accusations 'cause they weren't 

516.40 517.30 B: (( yes )) 

520.94 524.16 A: truly proven and then now obviously 

522.08 524.00 B: right 

523.99 533.12 A: you know they did make that mistake so and like so therefore when it comes to airport security like i honestly don't know if it's like the correct thing to do 

525.79 527.32 B: yeah they sure did 

532.92 540.49 A: whether it could be done better more cost efficient but i mean something had to be done after what happened then right 

540.18 550.80 B: i i think there's uh probably uh fifty million or more uh older people in the united states that uh from say the midwest and places like that that um 

550.68 559.07 B: are happy with the security arrangements they feel their government is doing something to protect them and that's about the only visible thing you can think of 

559.27 564.08 B: where you can see the government actually doing something to for your protection 

563.07 568.54 A: well also like yeah do a lot of people in the midwest the south are very ignorant 

568.88 575.63 B: [noise] right right so when bush uses terms like evil doer you know we have to put down the evil doer they're all for that [noise] [noise] 

568.98 570.55 A: of of what 

574.96 578.97 A: right because i mean bec- i mean if you look at them it's unfortunate to say 

578.78 590.39 A: but like in my opinion i think the majority of the country you know they are gung ho about you know patriotism but yet they really don't know exactly what's going on or they're ignorant of what is really happening 

589.79 591.11 B: right 

590.23 599.95 A: i mean and like this is what i learned when i first when to college it's not the fact that northwestern is in the midwest but i met a lot of people from the south who when they went to hear
