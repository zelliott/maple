33.54 34.88 A: uh yes i am 

34.89 36.59 B: oh so what do you study 

36.73 38.59 A: electrical engineering 

38.37 39.81 B: oh cool you're 

40.60 44.34 B: so uh um are you a grad student or 

44.24 46.04 A: yeah 

45.44 47.39 B: oh that's good 

46.41 48.00 A: how about yourself 

47.76 49.45 B: (( yeah i'm a grad student too )) 

49.33 50.59 A: oh what are you studying 

49.53 50.40 B: (( um )) 

50.72 51.82 B: (( um i'm )) 

52.36 54.23 B: (( studying transportation industry )) 

54.15 55.17 A: (( oh okay )) 

55.00 56.73 B: mhm 

55.79 56.82 A: cool 

56.82 60.80 B: so [mn] what do you think that september eleven has done to to your life 

60.49 63.55 A: [noise] um not much really [laughter] 

63.37 70.46 B: yeah that's right but i think this this has done some indirect affect but directly hasn't done anything like 

63.73 64.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

66.77 69.92 A: (( mhm )) 

70.29 83.36 B: i mean indirectly like uh you could say it's an economy factor you can see the security has been you know the airport the airport has more security you have to go through that security and it takes more time now [laughter] 

81.93 83.70 A: yeah 

83.19 87.24 B: uh but directly i don't see any effects what do you think 

86.45 89.27 A: yeah i haven't really done much differently um 

89.80 93.98 B: yeah to [mn] uh where you were you uh during the time september eleventh 

94.20 97.29 A: i was uh going to school [laughter] 

97.16 98.22 B: (( oh )) 

97.30 105.69 A: i heard it down somebody i was with turned a radio on and said hey a a plane just flew into the building well actually i heard it on the on the way to school um 

102.68 103.69 B: (( oh mhm )) 

105.79 119.87 A: on the since we're on the west coast it i guess it happened it was like around seven or a little earlier and i heard on the radio and and then the announcer sounded like he made it sound like it was very suspicious so 

109.14 110.01 B: yeah 

112.46 114.29 B: mhm oh 

119.79 121.43 B: yeah [laughter] [mn] 

120.59 122.20 A: (( that and you know )) 

122.67 125.64 A: he didn't believe it was an accident 

124.71 128.08 B: [laughter] yeah so what was your uh first reaction 

128.24 129.55 B: (( and how )) 

129.08 135.65 A: uh i was surprised i i mean it's you know the way the announcer made it sound it just sounded like it was 

135.69 139.54 A: kind of suspicious it sounded like a terrorist attack really 

138.75 144.41 B: yeah i it it did and but uh did you have anybody i mean uh 

144.61 153.03 B: (( your uh some you know yo- your family have got affected with this i mean some relative or something oh )) 

150.66 156.22 A: oh no one not really hadn't how about your how about your reaction what did you think 

155.67 158.96 B: (( [laughter] i was in uh india at that time so )) 

158.31 160.08 A: mhm 

159.42 166.62 B: once of it was totally i was totally shocked because uh by that time i i mean until that time i had this is my uh mind that 

166.41 178.62 B: nobody can actually attack [laughter] u._s. and it took so much uh planning and because it it should it could have taken you know and four or five years of planning [laughter] it was the way it was planned so i was really shocked i 

175.43 176.70 A: yeah 

178.47 191.61 B: couldn't uh you know at first i couldn't agree to it that it was something can happen but later i mean more and more they told me that yeah this is true and then i saw it on t._v. it was really really bad 

183.27 184.07 A: (( mm )) 

190.28 192.50 A: mhm mhm 

191.90 196.18 B: and then after that so many really you know being 

196.71 198.95 B: (( because uh i took but are )) 

200.06 206.70 B: they going to afghanistan then the iraq war everything [laughter] is just a consequence of that really 

203.11 204.93 A: mhm 

206.22 210.57 A: yeah yeah it's kind interesting how that turned out 

210.69 214.40 B: [noise] yeah hopefully it's it has ended now [laughter] 

214.72 221.32 A: well it's kinda strange i mean i i d- i didn't think bush had uh a reason to go to uh iraq [noise] 

216.78 218.05 B: yeah 

221.15 223.86 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

221.67 233.68 A: personally i mean it was you know going into afghanistan after the you know taliban and al qaeda i can understand i have no problems with that 

231.28 232.48 B: yeah 

233.03 234.14 B: (( i [laughter] )) 

233.76 236.45 A: but with iraq it was a lot different it's 

236.47 237.61 B: (( yeah they )) 

236.57 240.62 A: i think he's he's making it the bad situation kinda worse you know 

240.72 243.91 A: unless he can improve something very quick [laughter] 

240.87 242.36 B: yeah i think 

243.80 251.14 B: mhm yeah because uh you you you're never sure that you really hit uh some terrorist or you just hit them people 

251.26 252.92 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

251.55 259.42 B: (( so if if you really and that would really be uh more uh uh )) 

259.50 260.24 B: (( they'll )) 

260.29 264.13 B: feel that now they have to do something really really bad because 

263.66 264.92 A: mhm 

264.51 268.09 B: yeah so that can actually be really dangerous yeah 

267.45 269.54 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

269.99 273.19 B: so uh how's it going how's your summer 

273.56 276.96 A: oh pretty good [noise] how's yours 

275.01 276.06 B: (( oh good )) 

276.49 280.60 B: uh just hanging around what are you doing in summer are are you taking some course 

280.81 281.77 A: no 

281.22 282.91 B: (( on campus oh no )) 

282.28 284.18 A: no [noise] how about yourself 

284.49 287.52 B: not taking any classes i mean [laughter] just relaxing 

287.69 289.76 B: (( actually i would have said that this kind )) 

290.15 296.08 B: so i had to do some research these days i'm working on my thesis now- nowadays 

293.03 293.78 A: (( mm )) 

295.46 296.31 A: oh 

296.46 298.39 A: well that's good 

297.84 302.47 B: yeah uh what you have you completed one year of your grad student uh grad year 

301.58 305.27 A: yeah yeah got another year to go [laughter] 

302.79 304.36 B: oh so you 

305.09 306.23 B: [laughter] 

306.44 308.32 B: so uh what 

308.42 309.55 B: (( are you )) 

309.63 311.18 B: (( what kind of research do you do )) 

311.58 312.87 A: what kind of what 

312.70 313.79 B: research 

313.88 317.44 A: research it's um more an interest in analogue electronics 

317.38 318.20 B: oh 

319.64 321.05 B: (( mhm that's good )) 

320.90 322.85 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i mean 

324.26 330.91 A: the um engineering field has been pretty [noise] down since i guess uh a couple of years ago 

329.83 341.61 B: yeah yeah that's a that's so scary you know you've got one more year to graduate but [laughter] what do you plan to do do you uh plan to uh do some phd doctor study or you wanna go to 

339.73 342.45 A: no hopefully just get a job [noise] 

342.30 346.82 B: oh yeah but [laughter] you have just one one more year [laughter] let's to see how it goes 

346.66 348.82 A: yeah how about yourself 

348.16 352.86 B: [mn] yeah similar i just want to complete my grad studies and then go to some 

353.33 360.07 B: job but i'm not too sure what j- jobs can i use and it it's so bad you know i i 

356.84 358.61 A: mhm 

359.08 363.95 A: well supposing you know supposedly with the uh after nine eleven all the um 

365.10 366.41 B: mhm 

365.51 372.76 A: the economy was supposed to get better for engineering with uh you know [noise] a lot of defence industries hiring but it hasn't really happened 

368.71 370.41 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

372.97 387.75 B: yeah actually you know i don't believe these days when they say that [laughter] the economy should improve because one article would say that one guy would the other guy would say that it shouldn't actually [laughter] do and really understand who i believe 

382.75 384.45 A: [laughter] 

384.60 386.37 A: right 

387.76 389.51 A: mhm 

387.90 391.80 B: you see but the thing is that nothing is improving you know i had uh 

391.87 405.89 B: in my uh university we have some forty five students and uh computer science uh major and you know at least i mean not more than uh some five or six have got a job others are just looking for a job and they've got to do the 

397.43 399.20 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

406.31 408.01 A: not more than how many 

407.73 411.20 B: (( um some five or six guys like all of )) 

410.30 411.53 A: got a job 

411.50 414.60 B: yeah just five or six got a job out of forty five 

414.64 415.77 A: oh wow 

415.94 418.57 B: [laughter] but do you think it's good [laughter] 

418.38 425.73 A: that's not good um well in our school there's like a huge computer engineering department 

419.49 421.01 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

424.76 430.79 B: yeah it's a huge department and people are not getting jobs that's the bad so 

429.06 438.53 A: yeah i mean that field is kinda strange anyway it it seems kinda general and there's nothing you know real specific about it [noise] 

434.64 435.79 B: yeah i i 

438.70 446.57 B: i'm not seeing uh the i'm not saying they're better than people used to get jobs too easily 'cause i just came uh last fall i mean i 

448.14 457.19 B: uh so i have not been pleased to get job but now i've seen the guys that [laughter] so much a fear in their their eyes everybody's so scared to graduate 

457.31 462.19 B: they're happy that you know their study [laughter] once they graduate it's still bad 

457.35 458.15 A: (( mm )) 

459.88 460.79 A: (( mm )) 

461.85 462.52 A: (( mm )) 

462.74 464.39 B: yeah 

464.40 465.18 B: so 

464.58 467.11 A: yeah that's not good [laughter] i 

467.19 470.50 A: don't know i'm thinking of transferring to another university actually [noise] 

469.72 473.63 B: (( mhm but mhm yeah how about your university )) 

473.28 475.03 A: what 

474.01 475.27 B: how about your school 

475.48 476.70 B: (( how is it there )) 

475.62 476.68 A: um 

477.03 478.97 A: how is it 

477.95 480.84 B: how is it there in your school i mean 

479.86 486.16 A: it's crowded [laughter] i i mean i've met so many people who got laid off 

481.61 482.96 B: (( [laughter] )) 

486.19 487.84 B: oh that's 

487.21 489.62 A: and they're in a graduate program now 

489.59 491.63 B: mhm oh so 

490.67 491.99 A: which is weird 

492.54 496.19 B: have you worked uh before or you just uh finish your 

495.28 497.85 A: uh well no i was an intern but you know 

497.92 498.75 B: oh 

499.44 500.20 B: (( so )) 

499.48 501.03 A: that was that 

501.16 504.40 B: mhm so because uh the thing is uh that 

504.42 512.60 B: like me i've not worked for uh any time i i just got some internal that's it i i've not worked so it's like uh 

512.49 527.32 B: does they initially look for the people who have worked for some time and then [laughter] they look for like experience and i can get experience only once i get get some job [laughter] it's kind of a catch twenty two problem [laughter] i can't get a job without experience and i i can't 

520.77 523.38 A: [noise] mhm yeah 

523.80 524.72 A: [laughter] 

527.16 532.54 B: get experience without a job [laughter] [laughter] and so [laughter] so 

528.50 529.96 A: right [laughter] 

531.69 536.98 A: so what is it that uh [mn] transportat- transportation engineering is about 

536.34 544.04 B: uh it's about uh more about you know this uh road and traffics and you know uh these days it's been uh autom- autom- 

544.07 550.81 B: automated all along you know we have this th- where uh this you have these uh intersections 

550.53 551.56 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

550.86 555.17 B: right so uh it it has the red time and green time so 

555.61 560.94 B: to connect uh every uh intersection has a fixed time for red right so 

560.22 561.02 A: (( mm )) 

561.00 572.50 B: like uh say for one minute it'll be red for this uh north vehicles or something and for another minute it'll be green for the now they've uh they're trying to you know 

572.68 586.29 B: make it automatic so it uh it has some sensors and it uh sensors that car well when the cars are coming on the road it'll give them green and then um if there is no car on the road it'll turn 

579.85 582.26 A: mhm mhm 

586.24 588.55 B: (( turn off to red so )) 

587.66 588.63 A: okay 

588.63 592.53 B: so and so finally make it very very efficient you know 

592.38 593.26 A: oh 

592.65 599.95 B: 'cause sometimes you see that there is uh red for you and uh the other approaches has green but there are no cars so 

599.17 599.89 A: mhm
