1.47 3.28 B: hi my name is joe 

3.10 5.50 A: hi joe my name is janice 

5.82 6.74 B: hi 

7.24 16.26 A: hi i i'm not sure i understood everything the lady was saying but i think she said about professional athletes going on strike 

11.89 12.89 B: yeah 

16.06 20.97 B: yeah and she said that if they deserve the salaries that they're getting right now 

20.77 22.20 A: mhm 

21.51 25.39 B: yeah so what do you think about that 

24.62 28.50 A: well um i personally don't think they should go on strike 

28.66 31.41 A: and it's not actually because they get 

31.71 34.41 A: overpaid it's just that 

34.45 37.89 A: you know a lot of people this is american 

38.09 43.50 A: sport and they count on 'em and you know it just takes away from that 

43.32 46.85 B: yeah yeah i mean 

46.80 48.90 A: do you think they should go on strike 

48.80 54.56 B: no they shouldn't be- they- they're going on strike because of their salaries right that they're not getting paid enough 

54.44 57.02 A: that's what they seem to always say 

56.90 58.76 B: yeah 

63.09 69.02 A: and the more their salaries are the more it makes it impossible for the everyday 

69.61 73.61 A: jane and john doe family to go to the ball park 

73.25 80.58 B: yeah and they're they don't even know that they're getting so much more than the average person they 

80.71 88.87 B: they think they're not getting enough but they they say that after taxes they don't have that much but after taxes they still have plenty of money 

88.74 92.25 A: i would like to be so [laughter] broke wouldn't you 

91.92 93.30 B: yeah 

93.59 96.89 A: to have to live on their after taxes 

97.65 99.92 B: how much are their after taxes 

100.13 103.77 A: oh i'm sure they're still walking away with a couple of million a year 

103.33 104.55 B: yeah 

103.95 105.24 A: the good ones 

106.53 111.60 A: but i just i don't think they should be allowed to go on strike um 

110.89 111.67 B: (( no )) 

112.23 117.99 A: maybe if if all the teams got together and put a cap on the salaries 

118.12 123.79 A: and the players knew that that cap was there then they wouldn't be able to ask for more 

123.56 125.50 B: yeah that's a good idea 

125.24 128.63 A: that would eliminate the situation altogether 

128.79 135.30 B: yeah i mean they're not who ga- who gives them the power to go put on a strike 

136.68 138.97 A: i agree i agree 

139.79 149.37 A: and it's not that it just affects them personally it affects even the people that are trying to make a decent living at the ball parks 

148.68 150.04 B: (( mm yeah )) 

149.43 152.89 A: you know that that does away with their salary out of no 

153.57 154.67 A: you know 

154.81 156.36 A: fault of their own 

157.13 160.62 B: yeah so it's affecting a lot of people not only 

159.87 163.30 A: yeah because one person or 

163.68 168.58 A: or a group of people decide that their enormous salary isn't enough 

168.66 173.02 B: it's like they're so ah selfish they don't know that 

172.84 174.65 A: yeah 

173.76 176.34 B: (( they're not thinking about anyone else )) 

176.45 177.87 A: exactly 

177.23 179.62 B: they just got used they're just probably 

179.91 183.23 B: got used to the living the high life 

183.03 185.22 A: yeah well 

183.46 188.15 B: and they forgot what it is before they were big superstars 

187.54 194.62 A: right instead of appreciating what they have they're i guess that's kind of a border line greedy in my eyes 

194.02 197.99 B: yeah have you seen yeah 

197.25 203.90 A: more is better to a point but when you have more than most people ever have [laughter] why should you 

204.91 206.81 A: disrupt so much 

206.86 209.55 A: trying to get even more 

209.61 213.36 B: have you seen the commercial for champion sportwear 

213.85 214.98 A: which one 

214.73 223.04 B: it i i think they only have one it's like they advert- their commercial their point is how 

223.45 225.81 B: everything sports is now 

225.91 230.77 B: in the business page and it's all about the money and greed and contracts 

230.40 232.38 A: oh no i haven't seen that one 

231.23 235.40 B: yeah and then the champion is 

235.65 246.61 B: is saying the only contract you sign is with yourself and they're the only ones that are true they're they're not all about the money they're really correct about that 

244.01 245.01 A: mhm 

246.23 248.46 A: (( hm well you know [cough] )) 

248.81 254.22 A: excuse me with all the sponsors that a lot of the players get which is 

254.26 256.45 A: in addition to their salary 

256.76 260.63 A: i just can't even see why there would be a need for a strike 

260.90 262.69 A: to up the salary 

263.01 265.80 A: the need's not there the need's with the 

266.12 269.11 A: the everyday middle class people 

269.06 270.18 B: yeah 

269.59 275.11 A: to be able to take their child to a ball game without having to re-mortgage their house [laughter] 

275.40 279.15 B: yeah is there are they is someone on strike right now 

279.29 281.95 A: excus- um not that i know of 

281.36 284.54 B: oh i thought there might be someone 

284.71 285.51 B: (( hm )) 

285.11 286.41 A: i don't know 

286.47 290.47 A: it may be time i was thinking it was last year but maybe it was the year 

289.41 291.26 B: it was like 

291.43 294.22 B: last year i remember the 

293.85 297.36 A: but it was about this time of year wasn't it it was in the summer 

296.90 300.30 B: yeah i guess that's probably why they have this topic right now 

300.14 306.16 A: yeah could be i i don't listen to that much sport so 

300.71 302.29 B: yeah 

306.23 309.73 A: i'm not aware of it but it may be forthcoming 

310.15 311.36 B: do do you go to 

314.47 315.88 A: do what 

315.00 316.89 B: do you go to college 

316.63 319.41 A: no i have a son in college 

317.28 318.08 B: no 

318.87 320.28 B: oh i see 

319.69 321.25 A: (( [laughter] )) 

322.37 323.20 A: (( yeah i )) 

323.39 324.48 B: yeah 

323.90 329.10 A: mean he's not a big ball fan or a sports fan but if he were i would like to know that 

329.32 333.23 A: you know i would be able to take him to a game [laughter] 

333.03 334.41 B: yeah 

333.78 341.16 A: but it's it's just a pure matter of fact if they get more they're going to pass the cost down to everybody else 

341.02 344.02 B: yeah is like it'd be great if 

344.37 347.28 B: have you ever been at a sporting event 

348.30 350.59 A: oh yeah i've been to some games 

348.92 349.76 B: yeah 

350.14 352.96 B: you know like in basketball games or something they 

353.04 354.30 B: they um 

354.37 358.68 B: have like mascots throw stuff in the crowd like tee shirts and stuff 

358.49 359.44 A: uh-huh 

359.19 364.87 B: yeah it'd be good like if they just threw like money you know 

364.58 365.72 A: right 

365.18 367.00 B: yeah 

366.72 368.23 A: exactly 

368.63 373.24 A: and i think the sad thing a lot of those mascots don't even get paid [laughter] 

372.64 374.54 B: they don't get paid oh i didn't 

373.96 375.56 A: i don't think they do 

376.32 381.18 A: for some teams i guess it's just the p._r. the glory or the whatever 

381.59 383.34 A: that they do it for 

382.87 387.20 B: know that yeah i think there is like a school for mascots and you train to be a mascot 

386.62 389.41 A: oh i i didn't realize that 

388.54 390.72 B: yeah then you make it in the big league 

391.39 395.49 A: hm i guess if you were up there with the big boys you'd probably get something 

395.18 399.30 B: yeah maybe like a dollar a day 

399.75 402.08 A: a little something to stick in your pocket it 

402.09 403.43 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

402.92 409.57 A: would be nice but i hope they don't do another strike it just messes up everything 

408.25 409.15 B: yeah 

410.36 412.00 A: and it even hurts 

412.07 419.18 A: the guys that are coming up in the sports world that need the opportunity to make a name for themselves 

419.60 423.67 A: every game that's called off you know it takes away from them 

425.22 431.15 A: and it's from what i've seen it's usually the ones that are making the most money that are crying loudest [laughter] 

432.04 433.18 B: (( yeah a )) 

434.29 435.94 B: sad thing 

436.42 437.66 A: yeah so 

437.74 441.14 A: i personally don't think they should be allowed to go on strike 

441.32 444.97 A: i think if they have a issue with their money they should have 

445.00 452.26 A: something in their contract that says a mediator will be brought in and they'll abide by whatever the mediator decides 

452.20 454.73 B: er yeah i bet like someone 

455.60 464.17 B: some guy from their team says oh you know let's go on strike because we're not getting paid enough and everyone's like yeah yeah okay 

457.80 458.70 A: yeah 

464.27 466.16 B: so they all go on strike 

464.46 465.43 A: yeah 

466.09 470.50 A: and they'll all go on strike if i guess if one does everybody does 

467.53 468.67 B: yeah 

471.33 472.38 B: i mean 

472.25 479.43 A: i think they're protected by unions their union people must decide if they need to go on strike but 

479.75 480.77 A: still 

480.92 484.69 A: greedy is greedy and and you know it's just 

484.71 488.14 A: it should be able to be resolved without ever going that far 

488.41 492.31 B: when they go on strike do they usually get their demands met 

492.31 493.90 A: usually get what 

493.29 495.18 B: their demands met 

495.35 497.30 A: pretty much i think 

496.76 497.81 B: really 

497.79 501.08 A: 'course i think the one before the last one 

501.07 510.22 A: they were out a long time it really lingered on i mean that even affected like i i'm probably most into baseball 

510.18 519.55 A: and it you know it affected the series and everything 'cause how can you have a true series when all the games weren't played that's not fair to anybody 

519.26 525.59 B: yeah are are the taxpayers the ones that pay for the salaries of the people 

525.01 528.97 A: no i think that all comes from the revenue brought in by the games 

528.54 530.39 B: oh okay good 

529.76 538.17 A: that's why and sponsors i'm sure sponsors pay a lot i i live in georgia so i'm a big braves fan 

534.49 535.38 B: yeah 

538.15 540.16 B: oh i live in ohio 

539.91 541.63 A: wow that's a ways 

542.11 553.00 B: yeah i think our cleveland indians might have went on strike like a year or two ago i'm not sure maybe those are the ones that are in the news 

548.89 550.26 A: mhm 

553.21 554.19 A: yeah 

553.56 557.54 B: i forgot i don't really keep up with the indians because i don't like baseball that much 

556.94 558.30 A: mhm 

557.60 559.95 B: i i i'm a basketball person 

559.88 561.32 A: oh really 

560.68 562.03 B: yeah 

561.48 566.35 A: yeah well they all make an enormous amount of money 

565.74 567.26 B: yeah 

566.86 571.11 A: more than they could ever need have the need for more you know 

570.16 575.35 B: and plus they almost got all of them got their own commercials for 

575.06 580.07 A: oh yeah so just what they're making in sponsorship alone is unreal 

584.29 588.07 A: or if they do decide to go on strike maybe like they 

588.30 590.39 A: they can limit it to 

589.64 590.65 B: yeah 

590.44 594.01 A: if it's not resolved in a month or two weeks rather 

594.58 596.35 A: if ever [laughter] 

595.75 596.91 B: yeah just 

596.38 598.35 A: everybody back to playing ball 

598.60 599.94 B: yeah just let 'em go on
