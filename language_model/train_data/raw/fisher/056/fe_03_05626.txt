32.09 33.38 B: (( ah why don't you )) 

33.85 39.84 A: well okay i think that athletes are paid way too high salaries now 

40.35 43.90 A: with stuff that's going on in our country and in the world 

44.67 50.74 A: um i think it's outrageous that a person should be paid that much to perform 

50.11 52.57 B: well it's entertainment right 

52.02 59.07 A: yeah but i mean it's way out of proportion there's a lot of things they could do with that money besides entertain people do you know what i'm saying 

59.23 63.94 B: well i mean that's a wrong assumption because if you think about 

63.77 65.68 A: what's that 

64.62 69.41 B: it that's a wrong assumption because if you think about it there is supply and demand 

69.63 78.13 B: the economics of the situation is that there are very few people who can perform of that statute in that physical condition 

77.89 81.15 A: yeah and where where where does it end though

92.98 96.05 A: spread some of that money around do you know what i'm saying 

96.28 99.73 B: i think if a person is worth it he should get paid for it 

100.11 105.13 A: hm well i i can see that we're not going to agree on this so do you want to move on to something else 

104.82 112.17 B: well i'll ask you a question on this subject do you think michael jordan when he was making forty million dollars a year do you think that was 

106.50 108.11 A: yeah 

112.26 113.81 B: equitable 

113.52 128.44 A: well you know i i think that jordan sponsoring the ah the brand that he did when they're exploiting people around the world to work for nothing and then sell it here was totally wrong where's his consciousness do you know what i'm saying to you 

128.55 136.00 A: a lot of these people are getting paid a lot of money and they're doing nothing with the money except taking it and setting bad examples some of them too 

136.09 137.36 A: for the youth

148.81 150.67 B: (( for the best player )) 

149.40 160.17 A: are you are you going to equate him with a politician as far as that salary he's getting come on man he's playing he's playing basketball he's basketball dude 

154.68 155.76 B: (( no )) 

160.68 163.93 B: exactly he's the best there is 

161.99 164.50 A: right he's playing basketball 

164.54 165.53 A: (( you know )) 

166.44 169.33 B: let's say if you were ah [cough] the 

169.42 179.33 B: working in a company you were doing the best job better than anybody else i mean nobody else would even be close to you wouldn't you want to get paid the most 

179.37 184.40 A: would would i want to get paid forty million i think that's no i wouldn't 

183.54 186.28 B: so if somebody offered you forty million dollars 

186.43 188.03 B: you wouldn't take it 

186.55 193.32 A: i would i would i would take it but i certainly would spread it around i wouldn't take the forty million for myself

196.65 201.82 B: well jesus christ if you think about it he's not putting that money under his pillow is he 

201.18 204.14 A: what what does jesus christ have to do with this 

204.14 205.80 B: it's an expression 

205.76 208.08 A: oh okay i was just wondering do 

209.23 221.03 A: you think jesus christ would go for it in your right do you think in your right mind he would say this is good well you know i think you're wrong you know half the world is starving 

221.48 232.85 A: do you know what i'm saying to you and we don't care here in america because we have it cushy we can pay athletes forty million dollars and it's nothing think about it i'm trying to open your consciousness 

230.89 235.85 B: well you know you have to be that good to get that kind of money nobody's just going to come out 

235.62 240.95 A: nobody's saying that you're not good i'm saying it's not right 

241.00 242.48 A: (( do you know how is )) 

242.63 246.59 A: how is it getting subsidized in europe three dollars 

246.60 252.97 A: by the government and you know people in africa get less than a dollar day think about that equation 

253.39 256.01 B: it doesn't apply here 

255.38 256.74 A: well huh 

256.99 259.88 B: it does not apply with what you're saying 

259.32 268.94 A: oh of course it does these people are in positions to set examples and to flush some of that money around think about it you think you can just make all this money and not pay your dues 

269.04 276.42 A: especially where they're coming from they're coming from the ghetto lots of them do you here me they have an obligation 

276.53 283.86 A: to pay back for the people that were loyal to them for all the the ah sponsorship etcetera 

283.80 295.00 A: that's what this is about that's what makes a better world not to hoard all this money endorse products where they exploit people around the world and coming out looking shiny i don't think so 

295.43 304.13 A: do you know i'm just trying to open your mind to this okay there's a lot of problems in our state right now man we don't even have a budget they've cut all these programs 

304.56 307.80 A: out because we ain't got no money do you think that 

308.35 311.65 A: that's right when these people are getting all these millions

346.74 351.52 A: you don't all right well you don't get it and you're not going to get it because you're stuck on 

351.72 357.80 A: that you got to think about everybody everything else being fair you know other people getting equal pay

498.89 502.34 A: that's what i would do yeah i would 

499.40 500.91 B: in your opinion 

502.63 507.43 B: you would make it that these people would all have the same salary 

506.82 520.45 A: no that's not you're putting words in my mouth that's not what i'm saying at all what i'm saying what i'm saying to you is i believe in equal pay for equal work you know i mean not something so disproportionate as that 

509.76 512.43 B: okay well why don't you tell me how much money they should make 

519.04 524.74 B: yeah that's right that's right so if you were winning six of the eight championships in a row 

520.85 527.76 A: that guy dude that guy bouncing the ball around no matter how good he is does not deserve forty million dollars man 

527.73 529.85 B: that's your personal opinion

557.13 561.39 A: well yeah people are yeah people do all kinds of things you know 

561.45 575.92 A: i'm into raising people's consciousness being aware of what's going on and be aware about your fellow man and that's basically what christ said in a nutshell you know look out for him and you know i think if you're in a position of stardom and you can do some good by all 

561.69 562.59 B: yeah
