2.58 3.86 B: hi i'm jacob 

3.80 5.38 A: hi jake how ya doin' 

5.15 6.41 B: (( all right how are you )) 

6.30 8.02 A: oh pretty good 

7.42 8.77 B: that's good 

8.03 21.37 A: uh they guess we're supposed to talk about the airport and i think security's necess- is necessary and i think the more we have the safer we're going to be to fly a lot of people won't fly but i'll fly because i think we're doing a good job 

11.11 12.12 B: yeah 

21.45 27.54 B: yeah i i i think we're doing a good job also i um [lipsmack] i think that some of the stuff that they do [sigh] 

28.20 37.98 B: we could do without though i think a lot of a lot more [sigh] care should be taken into uh making it easier for people to get in and out of the airports 

38.35 47.71 B: 'cause i think that's a a problem that a lot of people deal with is like getting there having to get there so early because they're concerned about waiting in lines for security and and things like that 

47.08 53.48 A: [noise] well i don't think there's a better way to do it than what they're doing it now where they check everything and even even for a person 

53.73 66.72 A: having a bomb in their shoes you got to check everything and the more they check the the least chance we have of having another incident of uh uh like the world trade center being bombed you know 

66.92 68.20 B: right yeah 

67.09 71.13 A: uh i i i'm all for any kind anything that's secure 

71.19 76.36 A: uh anything for our security i am we have taken so much for granted in our life 

76.46 87.82 A: that that we didn't appreciate the we didn't appreciate the freedoms we have now we're losing some freedoms because we have to have the airports checked we have to check our luggage we have to do this 

87.70 95.29 A: and some people are mad about it i'm not mad about it i'm glad about it 'cause i don't want to i don't want to be up in a plane and have somebody uh 

95.50 99.14 A: uh uh come in and take the plane away from us you know 

98.77 102.04 B: right yeah yeah i guess though a lot of people 

102.16 106.20 B: see it just they're not as they're not angry about having to uh 

106.30 113.15 B: you know to wait in lines and things like that they're just angry because it affects them and they're angry because they're used to not have to do that you know 

112.66 115.04 A: yeah that's what it is it's it's that 

113.99 115.61 B: right 

114.86 128.95 A: they we never appreciated the fact that we had so much freedom before and we didn't have to worry about things like that now it's it's you can't you can't even go out without locking your door with without thinking about of security and what you have to do you know 

120.92 121.85 B: yeah 

128.88 131.21 B: yeah obviously i think 

130.18 133.53 A: i i go to the airport from time to time and i think that 

133.31 145.55 A: uh there is delays that that uh you don't you don't like but you have to put you either put up with it or take a chance in having somebody come in and and [laughter] destroy it and i mean hell i'd i'd rather fight them if somebody 

145.37 149.63 A: raises their fist to me i'd rather fight with them now than fight with them later 

149.54 150.93 B: right [laughter] 

151.61 153.11 B: yeah i i agree 

152.43 155.01 A: you you agree you do you fly a lot 

154.62 158.61 B: oh yeah i fly i guess i fly maybe three or four times a year 

158.12 159.54 A: yeah that's nice 

159.31 160.22 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

159.67 162.56 A: ni- nice to able to to take 'em but you see but the 

162.58 173.97 A: all the security and everything now is is hurting the airlines the airlines are in people aren't flying the airlines are going bankrupt you what what would you do if we didn't have air how would you go any place you know 

173.81 175.20 B: (( right mhm )) 

173.96 183.50 A: you charter a plane and and uh it it's one thing even because of our security even even our government there was a report this this today's news 

183.49 192.20 A: where some man got on the the presidential uh uh plane for news people yesterday and he didn't have his credentials and nobody checked them 

192.09 193.29 B: (( wow right [laughter] )) 

192.67 203.19 A: you know just think what could have happened if somebody would have shot uh the president there or or did something there uh somebody was wasn't doing their job security was not taking care of 

203.24 211.39 A: and it should be done even if we have to pay more bucks or get smarter people or what [laughter] whatever you do i don't know what you'd do for something like that you know 

211.02 212.79 B: yeah that that's crazy 

212.45 217.63 A: you know that's that's the way it is but oh uh lucky that guy got didn't do anything that he [mn] 

218.12 222.73 A: he got on the plane and the newspaper recognized that he he he he was 

222.74 231.12 A: uh not one of them but nobody said anything nobody did anything and luckily they they they found him after they they got they landed 

224.39 225.33 B: right 

230.95 231.95 B: yeah 

231.35 236.51 A: they they found he didn't have any papers he didn't have a passport so he couldn't get into the country you know 

236.24 242.96 B: [laughter] wow yes some something was obviously overlooked with uh security wasn't doing their job or 

237.11 237.94 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

241.17 252.81 A: oh yeah well now some somebody's head's going to roll on that they're going to the con- congress will pass another bill to do another thing which isn't necessary because they didn't pass the bill in the first place you know 

244.08 245.62 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

252.46 253.69 B: right 

253.10 256.18 A: it's it's a i i don't have too much uh 

256.19 257.11 A: uh 

257.20 264.70 A: uh respect for some of the the way our congressmen work i i don't like the idea that uh 

264.56 275.29 A: they make a bill not to solve a problem but to criticize somebody or to to do something for a friend or something like that you know i think we ought to get back to the the good old days when we were all 

275.10 283.20 A: good patriotic americans and we appreciated our freedom and we liked it and if we have to do it for security let's do it you know 

277.13 277.93 B: yeah 

283.46 288.77 A: i i like my life i have had i hope i live about ten more years [laughter] you know 

287.52 289.09 B: [laughter] 

288.85 290.88 A: arthritis and everything you know 

290.70 295.60 B: yeah i i agree with what you're saying though i think that uh the congress 

295.47 307.63 B: it doesn't seem like they they do things any more to solve problems but they they do 'em to solve problems but they also take you know big businesses into account and how it's going to affect everything instead of the wellbeing of the citizens 

307.26 315.21 A: well they have they have a very responsible job and it's a hard job and they shouldn't play politics they should do what the job co- 

315.04 326.30 A: contains in order to uh what the job is needed to be done in order to get the job done that we need security or whatever it might be now instead of doing that they'll play sil- they'll play politics and say 

326.07 330.85 A: (( oh well nixon shouldn't have done this or or uh somebody else should [mn] )) 

330.86 338.20 A: that's that's not that's not the way they have to get like what line do we need to have to keep us from doing that you know 

338.30 345.87 A: i get a little bit ticked off about we we find a terrorist we find somebody who uh is is causing all this problem 

345.88 351.02 A: and they put him in jail and he stays in jail for twenty years nobody even tries him you know 

350.95 360.93 A: that's not right i'd like to see these guy guys brought to trial right away and and punish them and get if they're if they're immigrants send them back to their country or do whatever you have to do you know [mn] 

360.53 372.10 B: right right yeah i don't i don't know if we should send them back to their country i think that if they commit a crime here that unfortunately i think that they should that we should pay to have them incarcerated here to keep an eye on 'em obviously 

371.42 375.82 A: yeah well when i say send 'em back to their country if they don't have if they're an immigrant 

376.03 380.59 A: and they don't have a passport then what should we do let we shouldn't let them stay 

379.82 386.59 B: oh all right yeah if they're an illegal if they're an illegal alien then send them back because obviously you should 

381.05 382.83 A: here that's what i mean you know
