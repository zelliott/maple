1.85 3.10 B: okay 

3.06 4.21 A: hello 

4.38 5.75 B: (( yeah what's up )) 

5.39 7.47 A: how you doing my name's matt 

7.60 9.54 B: (( oh my name's gamaliel )) 

9.42 12.42 A: all right so 

10.37 12.41 B: (( [laughter] ah )) 

13.55 18.84 A: we're talking about threats to ah what did they say u._s. sovereignty or something 

18.76 22.44 B: just um countries that we thought a threat to the um u._s. 

22.46 25.27 A: all right so what do you think 

23.45 24.58 B: yeah 

24.64 28.11 B: ah i'm not really opinionated about this topic really ah 

28.32 33.47 B: um this might be one of the worst topics i've got let me think what country that's a threat to this 

33.63 34.90 B: country 

37.75 44.25 B: um i guess i re- i really don't think any country's a threat to this country like that because of how developed um america is 

45.27 46.03 A: mm 

46.25 46.89 B: yeah 

47.80 49.01 A: nobody 

49.03 51.81 B: nobody no not nobody at all 

55.27 56.88 A: you don't think ah 

57.35 60.65 A: that kim jong il is kind of a threat 

59.99 61.05 B: mhm who who 

61.14 64.14 A: kim jong il the guy from north korea 

63.74 66.20 B: (( oh no i don't i don't feel i mean well )) 

66.35 76.10 B: i know north korea [laughter] the koreans i remember when when there was ah america when bush said that he he don't mind going to war with korea and um 

76.26 80.70 B: and um iraq the koreans said that um 

81.07 82.23 B: (( what did they say )) 

82.58 89.31 B: that america feel that they're the only country that is capable of um like launching a offensive attack and i i i know 

88.25 91.10 A: they're they're wait the other country that's what 

90.55 101.26 B: that that korea said that america believes that they're the only country capable of launching an offensive attack like [mn] every country doesn't have to be on the defensive 

101.08 102.49 A: all right 

101.34 112.83 B: yeah and i believe that was the issue that kind of um kept america from declaring a war on north korea so i guess if any country uh would do it it might be north korea but even still i don't think that's much of a problem 

112.91 117.25 A: yeah the problem is we got such a big military base in japan 

117.09 117.94 B: yeah 

117.26 127.26 A: and like all that dude wants to do is like he wants to he wants to kind of slander and then he's he's already trying to get like these mini nuclear bombs and i mean 

127.62 135.43 A: you know radiation is not a good thing in in any form if if it's not controlled and that guy just kind of um 

135.74 137.40 A: he's got his own little 

137.47 140.57 A: got his own little like nook he's like the kind of guy who 

140.98 142.00 A: you know 

142.36 148.03 A: when in college in your freshman year was just the guy who was in his room all the time 

148.30 155.40 A: nothing never socializes with anybody and that's kind of the way that guy is on the world scene and those are you know those are always the least stable people 

155.19 156.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

155.53 164.38 A: so that guy doesn't give a shit he'd rather make a name he lives in some little shit house country and what he's got nothing better to do he's got a pampered life so he'd rather probably 

159.71 160.55 B: yeah 

164.18 175.65 A: create a legacy for himself and go out in a blaze of glory i mean one of these clowns you know they they want to just take as many shots at the u._s. as possible every everybody everybody 

175.73 183.19 A: kind of probably entertains it who's not on our good side so i i definitely think that north korea's somebody who 

183.63 198.23 A: you know if we took out that regime that probably that probably i think that's a much more direct threat than than iraq was i mean it's it's easy to say now twenty twenty in hindsight but um iraq doesn't seem like it's you know 

190.90 192.14 B: (( mm yeah )) 

194.69 195.44 B: (( yeah that much )) 

198.40 201.21 A: like it would have been a big threat 

201.21 202.14 B: (( of a okay )) 

201.45 203.99 A: what what did you think about the whole 

204.08 205.23 A: ah 

205.41 207.42 A: threat that was 

207.46 211.65 A: told [mn] that he would be to us before the war and and what do you think about it now 

210.56 213.24 B: (( oh sorry i i didn't hear the last thing you said what did you say )) 

213.09 221.88 A: like what what do you think about the threat that iraq was before we went to war and what do you think about the threat that they could have been now that the war's over 

221.18 222.54 B: oh um 

222.80 236.29 B: well even when the war started i didn't think iraq was that much of a threat i told you i think ah the outlook that i have is l- less on um a historical or or or social point of view it's more like um the u._s. is is um 

236.12 241.19 B: highly like ad- advanced as as far as the military and things of that sort so 

241.26 244.09 B: even when you talk about a nuclear um 

244.31 250.58 B: nuclear attacks and things of that sort like the u._s. has a lot of they're they're they're highly prepared for attack like that 

247.13 248.07 A: yeah 

251.71 254.63 B: like the um defensive um things that they have 

255.49 260.00 B: so that that that's where my point of view is coming from it's not really coming from a social standpoint i suppose 

260.07 264.31 B: who's more um likely to attack us or to attack the 

264.55 272.85 A: [laughter] yeah i wish i thought more like you because i work with these russ- i work with these russian guys who are like 

272.99 283.06 A: you know in russia everybody's who's in kind of like solid academic or trade skill has it's it's geared toward the military in some way these guys were always telling us like 

280.61 281.44 B: yeah 

283.72 284.76 A: the 

285.20 292.21 A: fucking they could if they set off a dirty bomb if they get a dirty bomb into the country which which is very very possible 

291.79 292.85 B: yeah 

292.29 303.22 A: they could they could fuck up ah pardon my language they could screw up manhattan for eighty years based off even even a like a low grade dirty suitcase bomb 

298.04 298.86 B: (( oh yeah )) 

303.20 304.19 B: oh yeah 

304.20 312.58 A: yeah so these guys i mean maybe they're maybe they're bsing me but i mean they just it doesn't make for the best sleep at might when you talk to these guys who are like 

312.56 320.15 A: who are like russian they're just programmers but they were engineers for the russian military and they they 

317.36 318.16 B: yeah 

320.09 334.88 A: they're schooled in what is you know what can be done and how to prevent it and stuff and they say you're never as you're never as safe as you think and i mean let's face before nine eleven if you told anybody what was going to happen if 

325.91 327.06 B: oh wow 

328.99 329.88 B: yeah 

335.08 338.68 A: you knew that it was going to happen and you told somebody before then 

338.65 340.12 B: mm 

338.79 344.55 A: never they never would have believed you they you never would have believed anybody who would have told you that would happen 

344.31 345.62 B: (( yeah )) 

344.70 351.45 A: so that's what sucks about it all is that you think you know like we think you've got all this protection but 

350.90 354.06 B: yeah well another thing is that um this 

353.95 368.69 B: is why again i think north korea might be the biggest threat because of the guy's pomposity and things of that sort because man yeah you could you could say oh a dirty bomb could mess up manhattan for eighty years i mean i'm not denying the fact that that that is bad you know what i mean that's not good 

367.71 368.84 A: yeah 

368.78 375.54 B: that's a lot of lives could be um lost from from from any type type of destruction but manhattan is not 

375.88 377.74 B: five percent of the u._s. 

378.15 380.77 B: so you got to understand for a country to be 

380.85 383.21 B: for a country to attack the u._s. 

383.23 397.78 B: it would have an effect but at the same time they have to think about the consequences of what the u._s. could do to them 'cause i'm sure there's a lot of countries that could could um could launch an offensive against us but not enough to do that much damage to that much that much percentage 

397.71 402.27 B: of the u._s. so that that that's what people have to weigh before they attack the the u._s. 

402.20 416.29 A: right yeah you're definitely right about that however what we forget is that like you and i probably think the same thing that you know you're king of a country you go to attack america you you going to stay you're going sink with the ship of the country that you're 

416.22 418.87 A: that that you're from that's attacking america 

418.64 430.83 A: these guys are weas- these guys are the biggest weasels in the world like saddam hussein he survives two u._s. wars he considers himself victorious if the guy just survives you know what i mean 

430.63 437.55 A: he considers survival victory they don't care if their their their people get wiped out or whatever they live in a little 

430.78 431.56 B: (( yeah yes )) 

437.34 451.36 A: they live in a little f- little ivory tower in their own country and they're totally disconnected from the people but they have all the power so they don't mind going doing something with that power they have and then scramming disappearing so long as they keep their life safe 

451.35 455.41 A: and then you know resurfacing within a couple of years just like 

451.38 452.21 B: yeah 

454.40 455.27 B: yeah 

455.73 463.86 B: what i'm saying as far as the weapons on the scale of weapons the u._s. i'm not that i know but the i'm sure the u._s. has 

464.22 466.71 B: weapons like if they really wanted to 

466.96 467.89 B: (( ah )) 

468.03 469.85 B: kill saddam hussein 

470.21 478.15 B: i mean yeah they'd have to kill a lot of other people but it's possi- like you say how you say iraq is a small place and saddam hussein is in a in a small ivory tower 

477.92 491.07 B: it's possible to wipe out a whole iraq i'm sure with some of the weapons that the u._s. has but that's when the social issues come in about those things not right um thi that and the third so i'm saying like like ah for instance like 

491.06 493.59 B: you know ah what was it the forties when um 

493.68 498.93 B: japan attacked um the u._s. and then they they um the the u._s. dropped the the two um 

499.17 500.26 B: the two um 

499.28 500.74 A: atomic bombs 

500.29 512.14 B: atomic bombs yeah which which wasn't really merited some people might argue but due to the scale uh that that attack was when japan attacked us that's how the u._s. responded and and that crippled them for 

512.28 526.63 B: even today know what i mean so i'm saying a country will really have to deal with that so saddam hussein can rest knowing that the u._s. is going to go war with them and they're going to be in the country people a few people are going to die but they know the u._s. isn't going to [laughter] like 

526.06 530.11 A: is going to go yeah just annihilate the place like we did in world war two 

528.13 537.63 B: exactly they're not going to but i'm sure a dirty bomb that would ruin manhattan for eighty years the u._s. would easily be able to pose a threat 

538.02 540.73 B: a lot more devastating than that so 

540.39 547.64 A: [mn] yeah but what if we didn't know who did it and nobody claims responsibility you know what if it was a terrorist group or something like you know 

545.00 545.72 B: (( mhm )) 

547.61 548.45 B: mm 

548.23 549.54 A: you know what i mean 

549.43 552.01 B: yeah i i i i guess i guess you do have a point though 

552.30 559.97 B: i guess you do have a point though but i guess that's what a sort of conversation like this is for people that m- more um people that more um 

559.92 571.11 B: versed in these type of things like the c._i._a. should know like we're we're discussing who we think the the biggest threat to the u._s. is but they should have a lot more information on who they really believe is a bigger threat to the u._s. so 

571.15 572.08 B: i mean i 

571.31 572.21 A: (( yeah i )) 

572.59 577.59 B: yeah but my my my attitude comes from the point that it it don't really pay to be so scared or whatever 

578.07 579.92 B: it really it really don't pay at all 

579.71 590.02 A: i i j- i completely agree it's just that if i start to talk uh in my normal you know moment to moment life you know i'm not obsessing over it but when i start to talk about it i realise 

581.90 582.76 B: yeah 

587.58 588.52 B: yeah 

589.85 599.89 A: like it's just underneath the surface of everything you know what i mean it's just beneath there and it's good that i'm not too in touch with it but it it 

596.59 597.41 B: yeah 

598.90 599.86 B: mm
