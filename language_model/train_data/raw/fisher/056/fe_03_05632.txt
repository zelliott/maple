0.93 2.14 B: hello 

1.92 3.41 A: (( yes how are you doing )) 

3.08 5.17 B: (( good how are you doing )) 

4.10 5.94 A: good my name's mike by the way how are 

5.49 6.81 B: my name's val 

6.97 9.08 A: you doing where are you calling where are you from sir 

8.81 10.56 B: i'm in l._a. 

10.43 15.43 A: oh my last two times i talked to guys from new york so i'm in michigan myself so 

15.12 16.07 B: okay 

16.39 18.75 A: so what do you think about the players salaries 

18.89 27.92 B: um you know i think that they entertain and that people pay to go see 'em and people watch them on t._v. and that 

28.42 32.56 B: you know they sell what you know what can i say so i think they deserve 

31.79 34.29 A: (( you don't think it's too outrageous at all )) 

34.51 38.75 B: i think they're getting they're getting starting to get a little outrageous 

38.11 41.72 A: i mean with rodriguez twenty five million dollars a year it's kind of ah i 

41.77 42.59 A: (( mean )) 

43.31 54.27 A: granted ah they're decent ball players and stuff but i think it's a little steep only because i think it's one of the reasons why you gotta pay a hundred bucks for a ticket to go somewhere you know a family of four or whatever can't really go to a 

54.30 56.79 A: to a sporting event very cheap any more 

57.06 60.89 B: yeah i agree i agree it is getting it is getting difficult to 

60.98 65.22 B: be able to afford any kind of event 

62.96 64.15 A: (( yeah and )) 

64.33 76.07 A: and the thing with me is i've always said that if i could change anything like i i was i'm mainly a baseball fan myself i don't go much for football or basketball or that i i used to collect a lot of cards and stuff and 

75.39 76.24 B: uh-huh 

75.95 84.01 A: if i had my way about it i would pay them based on they'd earn a salary at the start of the year based on how many years they played the game for instance 

83.61 85.77 B: so you think you think that 

86.51 88.69 B: you think the rookies are getting paid too much 

88.84 102.33 A: um you know his base salary is a million bucks a year i think you know or two million or whatever but i i would pay them so much base salary at the start of the year and then what i would do at the end of the year is they would earn bonus money based on what the performance was 

101.99 103.58 B: mhm 

102.18 111.00 A: now if you you hit an extra amount of home runs you'd get a million dollar bonus you get this and how many times have you seen the guy sign these big contracts and they come up next year and don't do crap 

111.19 112.40 A: (( you know i )) 

111.28 114.62 B: so you think they should offer incentives for them to perform better 

114.62 123.68 A: think so yeah you know and that way they how many guys you know like nowadays you see a guy who wants to d._l. 'cause he's got a sort thumb or something when years ago guys played through that crap 

123.51 132.26 A: you know he didn't have the d._l. a case in point i'm ah in the detroit area and we had a gentleman a few years back he was called charlie hudson i don't know if you've ever heard of him he was pitcher 

132.45 133.58 B: (( mhm no )) 

132.49 138.16 A: he earned seven hundred and fifty grand the one year he played he went off like on the third day of the season he was dropped 

138.31 144.98 A: got in a car wreck and never played the whole year and he still juiced seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars and i think he might have pitched one game the whole year 

144.99 149.95 A: and he got paid three quarters of a million dollars to me that's just that's a rip-off is what it is 

145.02 146.22 B: right 

149.49 160.63 B: right yeah i don't think any of them i don't think a player should get paid for his own actions you know as far as i mean that's not an injury he sustained on the field 

150.27 153.79 A: there's no way and ah but i think 

156.60 157.46 A: yeah 

160.41 169.44 A: yeah but i say some of the guys find the easiest excuse to take time off and go into d._l. dean palmer's another one he signed for the tigers and he signed like he's played texas 

169.54 177.80 A: and he signed like a three year deal with this like twenty or thirty million bucks i don't think in the three years he's been here he's played a total of fifty games in three years 

177.45 179.27 B: mhm 

178.12 187.04 A: his back hurts this hurts that hurts and now i see the other day they're saying he might be retiring and stuff but i mean there's no way you know why should you carry a guy for that kind of money 

186.99 196.50 A: if he if he don't play for you you know years ago i don't know how old your are i'm forty five myself but years ago in the sixties and that them guys pitch a double header if they had to 

188.86 189.74 B: right 

196.95 207.65 A: and now you got the guys who've got the game set up you got the guys that starts then there's a middle reliever then this one then there's the closer you know and you got eight different guys where before they'd just throw one whole game and 

206.98 208.66 B: mhm 

207.60 216.74 A: that's why i don't think you'll ever see another thirty game win in the major leagues because you don't you got too many guys in between pitching and crap man you know it kind of takes it a way 

214.51 216.22 B: (( yeah i i )) 

216.84 228.72 B: i'm more of of a football basketball fan and especially in basketball you got these these guys coming out of high school and coming from overseas and you know they're giving them all this money and most of them 

224.11 225.17 A: oh yeah 

227.82 235.42 A: well look at what's his name there james ah a good name have you not heard of lebron james he's playing for cleveland i mean christ he's fresh out of high school 

231.96 233.77 B: right 

235.05 236.88 B: right 

235.22 248.98 A: he signs a ninety million dollar deal with nike and crap and ah i mean that's just i get what do you expect a kid to do at eighteen years old or whatever he is and he's drawing almost a hundred million bucks i mean he doesn't know what the hell to do 

238.34 240.28 B: yeah 

244.06 245.32 B: yeah he's eighteen 

247.55 248.48 B: and that's 

248.52 252.73 B: and plus the contract he's going to get is going to be the same probably another hundred million 

252.56 262.08 A: yeah but i say he won't know what life is on the road it's going to be a little different than in high school and traveling with a you know pro team and stuff all these different cities and everything and um 

261.08 264.82 B: and it's like you know forty more games and 

264.10 275.85 A: yeah he don't know if he's there's what five six guys maybe that have done that kobe and um a few other ones that have come along from out of high school and done i think mcgready was another one possibly and um 

275.11 279.18 B: right and um what's his name from minnesota ah 

279.72 282.02 B: kim garnett 

280.61 284.69 A: yeah but for every one that makes it there's probably three hundred that don't 

284.48 286.44 B: yeah 

284.96 298.50 A: so i mean and guys have all these dreams and stuff and um personally i think if i was a player i wouldn't take that kind of money i would rather take a smaller salary i might sound stupid and that and maybe have a deal that reduced the ticket prices and try to put some people in the seats 

298.28 299.51 B: yeah 

298.77 303.98 A: you know what i mean especially in tiger stadium because our our team is just about fucked this year [laughter] 

303.07 308.26 B: what isn't baseball ha- haven't they had problems the last couple of years filling the seats 

306.52 319.81 A: yeah yeah well especially in detroit i see because we've only won twenty games this year i think [laughter] so we got trammell as our coach or manager now and they just ulrich owns the red wings too and he puts tons of money into the red wings 

311.72 312.72 B: (( oh )) 

319.35 320.17 B: (( oh )) 

319.81 327.87 A: but he won't spend piddly on the tigers and i'm thinking if he don't want to put the money in the team why don't he put it up for sale and let somebody else do something with it 

327.33 328.35 B: right 

327.67 335.81 A: we haven't got a decent ball player in i don't know how many years it's been it's every year it just you know last year we lost a hundred and six or seven games it's like that every year 

336.11 347.24 A: i used to go down thirty times a year but i just go i used to collect autographs i got a bunch of probably two three thousand cards and i've got signed baseballs and different odd things so i'd go down just for that purpose 

347.18 353.42 A: you know but it's kind of hard to root for a team that it's kinda like the lions were the last couple of years too they won one or two games out of sixteen [laughter] 

352.55 354.53 B: you live in a tough city 

354.13 358.57 A: oh yeah we have the red wings but they bowed out on the first round this year so 

357.86 359.67 B: right 

359.63 367.07 A: fifty to sixty million bucks i think going out in the first round until somebody figured out for revenue if they won a couple of rounds and home games but ah 

364.78 366.57 B: right 

367.40 371.48 A: i just think they need to ah tone it down a tad a bit i think 

370.96 374.20 B: what players have been striking 

373.50 383.60 A: ah baseball talked about again last year you know if they don't make enough money now and stuff and i think it's a good thing they called it off because if they did it's probably the end of baseball as we know it 

376.68 378.26 B: right 

383.75 393.22 A: i mean where else can you go and make that kind of money and you know they're making rodriguez makes like sixty seven thousand dollars a day i think i figured it out to at twenty five million a year 

393.36 400.26 A: i don't make i work two jobs and i barely make that in one year and he gets it sitting on his butt playing ball one day and that's just kind of ridiculous 

394.99 397.99 B: (( mhm )) 

399.67 403.09 B: yeah yeah i agree it is getting out of hand a little 

401.82 408.52 A: you know i mean there's a lot of guys there's you know police officers and different ones you know lieutenants there and that they don't make that kind of money 

408.04 410.23 B: no definitely not 

408.31 416.94 A: and he does it for you know whacking a baseball one day or if he sits out the day he still gets his sixty four grand or whatever twenty five million divided by their games comes out to be 

416.94 417.81 B: uh-huh 

417.28 428.29 A: it's a lot of money [laughter] you know granted he's he's a hell of a ball player but i really don't think he's worth that much money and he hasn't really done nothing for 'em because their team still stinks [laughter] 

427.28 432.00 B: yeah i remember reading something in the paper this past year um you know scotty pippin 

432.48 435.71 B: who's on the trailblazers now he 

436.16 441.09 B: you know got paid all this money just because his name you know but he's getting old 

439.76 440.64 A: yeah 

440.90 441.87 A: oh yeah 

441.32 448.89 B: and they figured out that he got paid pretty much it was something like twenty thousand dollars for every basket he made this past year 

448.18 448.92 A: (( oh )) 

449.04 450.26 A: that's crazy 

449.23 453.25 B: which was just crazy yeah just totally totally 

452.08 463.19 A: isn't it but they take it i guess and we willing enough to pay it to them i guess but i think all that does is just jack the prices up ah you know like red wings if you can get a ticket to get in the place it's like a hundred bucks a seat 

462.41 465.03 B: mhm 

463.63 473.19 A: and who's got that kind of money to dole out all the time i sure don't actually the tigers have a deal where you can go for eight bucks and get a seat on the right field you get a hot dog and a pop for eight dollars 

466.84 468.65 B: right 

472.92 475.09 B: yeah 

473.63 487.23 A: but then again nobody wants to go watch 'em so that's probably why [laughter] so but i mean granted you know a family of four could actually go down there for like thirty forty bucks and watch a ball game but then it owes you twenty five bucks to park your car across the road too though so 

486.62 493.26 B: right yeah it's getting to the point where you know only the only the rich can pretty much afford it 

492.67 499.04 A: yeah you know football's the same way i don't know which teams are in your area you said you're in california i know the lion 

497.20 500.30 B: (( yeah i've only been here for )) 

500.78 503.66 B: recently i'm from washington d._c. originally 

502.65 505.50 A: oh are you okay yeah the lions i think 

503.79 506.77 B: (( yeah )) 

505.90 513.08 A: play on a an hour and a half from here and i think they're close to a hundred bucks a seat they just went into that new field a year or so the ford field they built 

512.77 514.22 B: right 

513.41 519.47 A: actually next to co america where the tigers played side by side but i think it's seventy five hundred bucks a seat there 

519.62 525.02 A: and you know you take three or four people and you're talking three hundred dollars for a football game that's pretty steep 

524.81 528.08 B: (( yeah that's that's pretty much how the red skins were )) 

527.86 528.92 A: oh yeah 

528.39 530.37 B: go to see a red skins game 

530.43 538.45 A: it was good in the old days i loved them back in the ah john regan's days they used to have a decent ball team i don't think they've done a whole lot since then if i 

534.49 535.37 B: uh-huh 

538.48 543.76 A: remember correctly i've kind of got a way from football but i used to watch them all the time when they had them guys playing 

542.09 545.41 B: not not too much they ah 

545.99 553.65 B: they're struggling with coaches and ownership and they got steve spuria from the gators now 

554.50 556.99 A: oh yeah isn't the owner like a billionaire or something 

556.52 562.44 B: yeah dan schneider he is he's throwing money around and 

557.97 559.33 A: dan schneider yeah it 

560.89 564.05 A: hasn't done him any good though has it it doesn't look like 

563.35 565.86 B: no not not so much no 

565.84 572.13 A: yeah sometimes it works and some you know george steinbruner seems to have pretty good luck with his money he tosses around but um 

571.82 573.03 B: yeah 

572.41 578.37 A: do any good if they knocked off a thing and made a cap or something it makes them more teams compat- you know compatible 

578.22 580.01 B: mhm 

578.50 590.32 A: instead of having two or three teams it's always like it's atlanta new york you know year after year after year it seems like in the world series it's actually nice to see um anaheim angels win it last year i guess it was 

589.93 596.32 B: yeah i got out here right about that time and it was a big deal because you know anaheim's right on the street 

595.66 599.89 A: yeah but i mean how many teams do you see year after year after year that don't do squat
