0.75 3.05 A: hey how are you doing i'm martin 

0.86 1.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

2.44 4.23 B: (( i'm neil fleischer how you doing )) 

4.01 6.98 A: pretty good pretty good so your name was neil 

6.46 7.37 B: yes 

7.96 10.87 A: so neil what do you think about this i 

10.74 12.76 B: well i think i think 

12.92 18.02 B: iran and north korea is a threat to the united states what do you think 

17.14 24.17 A: think that north korea is a threat to the united states i think that north korea could possibly be a threat to the u._s. but i think that ah 

24.46 34.79 A: i think that the foreign policy that bush puts in place makes north korea more of a threat than it than it would be north korea's essentially pretty broke country and 

30.45 31.28 B: right 

34.19 35.42 B: right 

34.82 42.13 A: you know um by george bush coming out and saying that ah they're part of the axis of evil 

42.20 49.46 A: and ah you know really putting pressure on on the country they're kind of like a rat backed up in a corner 

49.16 50.40 B: right 

49.81 56.00 A: like have you noticed you haven't really heard too much about north korea in the past couple of months i was actually just thinking about this this morning 

55.79 56.56 B: yes 

56.10 66.05 A: because i was looking at a time magazine fr- back in february and ah they were talking about the danger of north korea that ah you know they could be 

66.06 78.52 A: running these arms to uh all these other countries and uh funding terrorist organizations you know if it's such a great threat how come i haven't heard anything about it in the past you know three four months 

77.86 79.12 B: right 

78.42 86.90 A: so ah you know i'm a little skeptical i think that uh if our foreign policy was set up in a way 

87.07 99.71 A: to really not try to instigate we'd be uh better off um i don't know about iran i think iran could be a threat and really the problem with i think the problem with uh a lot of uh 

100.82 108.44 A: a l- lot of uh positions that that you and i could take is that w- we're not really privy to a lot of information either so 

108.18 110.07 B: right 

109.45 110.83 A: yeah 

110.92 116.20 B: (( it's a it's a 'cause they got the uranium you know they got the uranium down there you know )) 

115.86 117.15 A: they got the what 

116.64 118.44 B: (( ura- uranium )) 

117.87 119.26 A: uranium 

118.66 120.43 B: right that's the key you know 

120.76 134.24 A: yeah they've got uranium but you know it's ah it's a little more complicated than that because just by having uranium doesn't mean that you're ready to make weapons it needs to be a certain grade it needs to be weapons grade uranium 

122.46 123.29 B: right 

134.28 141.22 A: and ah you know even to get to that point means that that your country has the technology 

141.52 150.99 A: to synthesize that or to produce it to process uranium to make it weapons grade uranium i mean it's like one thing to have enough ah nuclear 

150.52 151.65 B: right 

151.10 164.05 A: uh material to run a nuclear power plant it's another thing altogether to have nuclear material or the or the processes to make that nuclear material weapons grade so that you can actually have a weapon 

152.18 152.87 B: right 

163.46 164.89 B: right 

164.70 167.16 A: so i think there's a little bit of a ah 

167.03 181.82 A: i think it's a little disingenuous to ah attack a country strictly for having uranium and it's also kind of two faced too because you know the united states does have all these weapons as well you know like who's policing who 

178.71 182.25 B: right right what about the anthrax situation 

182.57 183.65 A: what's that 

183.01 186.44 B: what about the anthrax situation what do you think that could do 

185.59 187.68 A: the anthrax situation 

186.47 188.39 B: right right 

187.73 193.63 A: i think that's a little bit different uh anthrax is something that you can create 

193.93 206.65 A: um in a lab you know someone could be making that anywhere you know it's not like it's not like uh trying to whip up a nuclear bomb in your kitchen you can whip up anthrax i believe 

195.94 196.77 B: right 

198.90 199.75 B: right 

203.88 204.70 B: right 

206.64 210.68 A: once again it's a question of what grade of anthrax you know the finer 

210.35 211.37 B: right 

210.72 219.43 A: the molecules the more dangerous it is what do you think about the what do you think about the anthrax attacks that happened in the ah country 

213.67 214.23 B: (( [cough] )) 

218.86 221.60 B: i think uh i think it was one of the uh 

221.85 227.39 B: people that that know what they're doing you know the people that you know with knowledge you know 

227.29 233.16 A: you think it was like a u._s. scientist possibly or uh do you think it was ah 

232.29 234.99 B: maybe kids huh what do you think about kids or 

234.39 235.91 A: kids 

235.22 238.05 B: kids you know kids that you know teenagers 

236.59 238.75 A: kids whipping up anthrax 

238.16 240.95 B: teenagers or something maybe teenagers 

240.38 241.72 A: excuse me 

241.11 242.54 B: teenagers maybe 

242.37 243.77 A: teenagers 

244.00 256.32 A: mm they'd be some pretty bright teenagers i guess you know from what i understood from what i remember it was uh i'm not sure whether it was weapons grade anthrax or not actually 

255.72 259.16 B: right well i think i think 'cause they did that 'cause 

259.27 263.96 B: they had all this thing happen in new york and they tried to you know 

263.91 265.85 A: yeah are you are you from new jersey 

265.44 266.73 B: no philadelphia 

266.38 269.54 A: philadelphia oh i just moved out of philadelphia 

267.06 268.01 B: right 

269.00 270.36 B: right 

269.96 272.22 A: yeah yeah well you know 

272.97 281.40 A: ah as far as the new york situation i don't know what wh- which one are you referring to what happened in new york 

280.23 284.51 B: you know the um you know the attacks you know with the airplanes and all that you know 

284.17 285.64 A: with the airplanes 

285.02 286.51 B: right 

285.88 288.09 A: what happened with the airplanes i'm not familiar 

286.92 288.63 B: you know they bombed the uh 

288.73 290.60 B: empire you know the um 

290.74 293.37 B: that building the world trade center you know 

292.81 295.59 A: yeah what about it 

295.05 297.56 B: [mn] i think it was connected to that 

297.30 302.16 A: (( ah could have been it could have been were you in philadelphia when that happened )) 

301.56 302.83 B: (( y- yes )) 

302.50 307.10 A: yeah i was i was in new york when that happened yeah i was right down on twelfth street 

306.65 307.95 B: right 

307.49 310.70 A: and sixth avenue saw the whole thing go down 

308.70 309.59 B: right 

310.20 311.63 B: right 

311.14 312.87 A: man that was crazy 

312.33 314.43 B: i know i know everybody was 

313.14 315.47 A: but ah what's that 

314.90 317.59 B: everybody was scared that day you know it was 

316.86 324.40 A: oh absolutely it was horrifying the most horrifying thing i've ever witnessed with my own two eyes in my life probably ever will 

318.83 320.04 B: right 

322.58 323.48 B: right 

324.06 325.14 B: right 

324.61 333.91 A: um but you know i think that that uh when events like that happen and getting back to the topic of foreign relations 

333.39 334.33 B: right 

333.75 344.96 A: ah it turns into a free for all i mean ah if you can see what happened after september eleventh uh immediately uh the united states really went onto this 

336.37 337.22 B: right 

345.70 347.20 A: unilateral 

347.25 360.11 A: ah campaign across the world and ah i- it really makes you question exactly what went on who's responsible what are the motivations exactly 

349.72 350.58 B: right 

360.70 368.31 A: what is the government really getting out of doing what they're doing you know um you know afghanistan 

364.66 365.68 B: right 

365.79 370.24 B: right do you think do you think saddam saddam hussein is still alive 

370.21 372.57 A: do i think saddam hussein is still alive 

371.38 372.83 B: yes yes 

372.63 380.09 A: apparently it sounds like he is you know from from the reports th- that i've read in the papers and the internet 

374.58 375.45 B: right 

378.79 379.66 B: right 

380.12 385.18 A: ah you know i don't know i haven't talked to him but they think he's still alive right 

381.52 382.90 B: you think he could do 

383.42 385.98 B: right do you think he could be a threat to the united states 

385.67 386.87 A: excuse me 

386.28 388.53 B: you think he could be a threat to the united states 

388.01 389.46 A: saddam hussein 

388.81 389.71 B: yes 

389.69 397.57 A: ah in a weak- well he seems like in a in a very weakened capacity but sure without question if he has a network 

397.57 409.74 A: you know to ah to activate uh some kind of a terrorist operation you know without question i think there are a lot of a lot of organizations around the world that 

408.87 412.70 B: well see what do you think will happen to his weapons of mass destruction 

412.63 414.80 A: his weapons of mass destruction 

413.81 417.26 B: yes what do you think he sold them to somebody or um he's hiding it 

415.71 424.89 A: um pr- i'm very skeptical whether or not weapons of mass destruction actually existed in iraq post nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety seven 

424.42 425.57 B: right 

424.99 437.46 A: um it seems to me that somebody would have found them i mean the u._n. would have found traces of uh of some kind of activity you know and it's more of a red herring i 

437.63 440.49 B: but they did that in kuwait they did something you know 

441.03 444.75 B: kuwait you know they did they did do something you know 

443.38 444.30 A: (( think )) 

444.57 445.96 A: in kuwait 

445.36 446.53 B: right 

446.87 451.03 A: the you're saying they found evidence of weapons of mass destruction in kuwait 

450.38 454.03 B: no i said they they used it i think they used it on kuwait didn't they 

453.58 459.89 A: y- well yeah they well are you talking about just this time around or in the early nineties 

459.32 461.20 B: early nineties yeah 

460.49 466.83 A: yeah exactly but the point would be that after that happened ah they had u._n. 

467.85 475.57 A: u._n. forces there that had been going through and dismantling um all the weapons of mass destruction 

475.88 484.11 A: meaning ah the ah i think it was mustard gas generally chemical warfare biological warfare 

483.51 484.43 B: right 

483.89 493.94 A: and ah i think they cleaned them up and if i remember correctly by nineteen ninety seven uh iraq was essentially clean 

494.33 504.25 A: so you know at this point i don't think they're really going to find anything maybe they will maybe they took it took the whole shop over to syria who knows 

495.44 496.13 B: (( right )) 

498.41 499.22 B: (( right [mn] )) 

502.56 515.04 B: right you think his excuse was the president's to take over the oil fields is that what was his excuse his excuse you know for attacking iraq is that because of the he wanted to take the oil fields away or 

507.80 509.27 A: excuse me 

514.23 524.51 A: well i think it's a little more complicated than that but i think that there were opportunities that were definitely taken advantage of if you look at afghanistan um 

517.00 517.83 B: mhm 

524.93 536.09 A: what happened was that ah [sigh] while we were in afghanistan um a military base was built right around turkey and pipelines were put into the caspian sea 

527.48 528.04 B: (( [cough] )) 

535.64 536.41 B: right 

536.03 544.76 A: which is a huge oil reserve that you know the united states i'm sure has been looking into for quite some time and didn't have access to until 

542.08 543.49 B: because look at 

543.61 549.03 B: 'cause look at the higher higher price of gas [mn] then and n- now it's going lower you know 

548.70 552.12 A: it's go- it is going lower it is going lower 

550.12 553.08 B: yes i think there's something going on you know 

552.59 563.49 A: there most definitely could i mean if you if you look at the uh if you look at the cabinet if you look at the uh bush's government ah most of those guys are oil barons 

554.05 555.00 B: you know 

560.13 561.24 B: right 

562.86 564.28 B: right 

563.89 568.55 A: they're all oil barons so it's you know and it seems like kind of a 

565.07 566.41 B: right 

569.13 573.77 A: kind of something a little sketchy going on there could be a little shystey 

571.38 572.44 B: right 

573.20 574.45 B: right 

573.86 575.56 A: (( no doubt )) 

575.01 580.24 B: what about uh israel you think they have a threat to the united states israel israel 

578.41 579.75 A: excuse me 

580.66 591.92 A: i think israel is a threat to the united states by sheer virtue of the relationship between the united states and israel i think that ah when you're dealing with a situation 

587.90 588.78 B: right 

591.91 599.89 A: as unstable as the middle east it it doesn't do anybody any good to be viewed as you know 

596.89 597.71 B: right
