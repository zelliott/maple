68.83 70.89 A: lower haight 

69.91 80.01 B: oh yeah yeah uh you you being somebody who's uh a resident of new york you might uh be sensitive about the subject of uh airline security 

79.78 83.32 A: um i don't really know 

83.86 85.68 A: um do you fly 

86.53 90.07 B: occasionally uh not so often uh

93.32 94.99 A: right 

94.01 98.13 B: and uh i i i cannot remember 

98.22 100.86 B: an incident when i was on airplane 

101.27 107.63 B: when uh [mn] when i i was frightened for security reasons 

105.37 106.34 A: mhm 

107.05 108.43 A: right 

107.81 119.05 B: i mean i was on one flight where it was a it was a small plane that might even have propellers on it i [laughter] probably not but it was a you know little dinky plane and uh [mn] 

119.30 123.40 B: it might you know as as where where i'm actually from is massachusetts uh 

122.46 123.30 A: mhm 

123.72 130.50 B: and uh you know it it was some kind of a maybe a flight out of newark or something from there to providence rhode island 

128.47 129.30 A: mhm 

130.72 131.88 B: and uh 

132.46 137.63 B: you know it was a a frightening experience because the wind was just knocking the plane all over the place 

137.21 138.15 A: right 

137.84 138.99 B: and uh 

139.03 143.42 B: you know i that you know that was a a time that i had fear for my life but i 

143.52 151.84 B: i can't think of a an incidence where there was you know airport security was really on my mind i've on- i've only flown once since the september eleventh 

152.39 153.30 B: uh 

153.59 158.35 B: incident and i've you know that that's when i i got a 

158.26 168.78 B: a firsthand look at all the added security they have now and i mean i'm glad that that's there you know it it it does make me feel safer and i think it's appropriate 

162.67 163.79 A: right 

169.22 170.99 B: but uh [mn] 

171.24 176.28 B: you know boy uh uh i i i don't know how far you can go with that type of thing 

176.79 178.22 B: you know and 

176.89 182.99 A: well it's interesting i heard something on m._p._r. the other day that none of the the freight that's shipped is checked 

182.61 183.44 B: (( mm )) 

183.35 191.16 A: so there like there's extensive you know personal checking of people but if someone's working for a company that ships airfreight 

191.01 198.56 A: like none of the freight gets checked it gets put into the hold of the of the commercial i mean the yeah commercial aircrafts that are flying passengers 

197.99 202.34 B: so you're saying if someone wanted to destroy a 

202.47 205.56 B: like a u._p._s. airplane if there is such a thing 

204.69 210.27 A: no no no they put they put the freight on normal passenger planes they put it in the in the cargo hold 

210.42 217.51 B: so you're saying if you're going to just put a bomb in a box and ship it somewhere by airmail 

214.27 215.37 A: right 

215.54 217.23 A: yeah you you just you 

217.41 228.21 A: you either ship it or if you work for the company then you could put it in because once they get the crates they don't look they don't look in them because it's uh they can't x. ray them 'cause they're too big so 

219.58 220.22 B: (( mm )) 

228.23 234.74 A: they just accept them and put them in the planes even though they're searching passengers very thoroughly so 

233.51 235.32 B: oh yeah um 

235.86 238.62 B: i i didn't know about that uh 

238.74 241.78 B: you know that would be something if what you're telling me is true 

241.96 245.02 B: uh i would feel better if um 

246.07 248.01 B: you know if they did something 

248.28 250.41 B: to increase security that way 

250.16 251.26 A: (( mhm right )) 

250.64 255.35 B: you know and uh i think that would lead to safer airplanes if what you're telling me is true 

255.38 260.38 B: but i've you you know i i've never heard of that before so uh 

260.02 273.72 A: i think some people have uh they're trying to put a bill into congress and they're of of course the all the shipping companies are arguing with them because that'll make their prices go up and the time be longer and then they'll be less competitive with ground shipping so 

272.24 282.19 B: oh and who who are your congress people there uh i i know you got well you know uh that's you actually have hillary clinton as a senator right and 

280.89 289.62 A: yes she's a junior senator and chuck schumacher schumer is the the senior senator 

289.87 291.16 A: um 

292.24 296.35 A: [lipsmack] gosh i don't even know who who is representative in the house of rep 

296.30 299.73 B: you you uh do you know who's sponsoring that bill even or 

299.11 301.96 A: oh i don't think it's a new york um 

301.51 302.14 B: mm 

301.93 315.21 A: senator or congress person who's sponsoring it necessarily i forget who it was who was trying to sponsor a bill i don't think it was actually on the floor it [noise] yeah but they were trying to introduce it [lipsmack] i forget who 

315.06 320.35 B: it's it's probably not a massachusetts congress person who'd do this but um 

318.35 319.89 A: (( [laughter] )) 

320.55 324.47 B: (( i i mm hm )) 

320.66 326.65 A: probably somewhere where there's not a bunch of companies that ship stuff in the uh ship stuff by air 

327.70 335.67 B: yeah well [laughter] yeah uh you know that's something i'd be in favor of i mean if if you know if what you're saying is accurate that you can just 

335.40 336.57 A: right 

335.76 338.92 B: put a bomb on an airplane without much difficulty 

338.94 347.15 A: well you have to be able to get it [noise] you'd have to be able to have access to uh something that's going to be shipped like as freight 

339.09 340.07 B: then uh 

347.37 353.09 A: so you're going to have to like either work at the company that's pack that's sending the stuff or 

351.94 352.70 B: mm 

353.52 355.12 A: (( somehow )) 

355.29 360.38 A: i don't know like i think it's mostly commercial shipments so it's probably a bit more difficult to access 

360.05 361.45 B: huh 

360.91 364.96 A: you know like they're they're shipping larger items um 

363.87 368.99 B: yeah you you know who my congress person here is is it's uh nancy pelosi 

368.60 370.59 A: mhm 

369.18 371.82 B: i don't know if you're you know that up on 

370.94 371.71 A: (( don't know )) 

371.91 375.35 B: politics and current events and that kind of thing but she's the uh 

375.42 377.99 B: the minority leader you know she's the 

378.14 384.34 B: the the leading democrat in the in the house of representatives i mean of the minority of the dem- what's that 

378.49 379.50 A: in the house 

380.85 382.48 A: is she is she the whip 

383.72 386.05 A: right is she the the minority whip 

385.53 387.27 B: no no minority leader 

387.09 388.10 A: right 

387.43 390.12 B: uh maybe it was dick army 

390.26 394.50 B: that uh she stepped in for or i know that dick uh park was a 

392.24 392.90 A: (( park )) 

394.86 399.23 B: you know was a was up there on for the democrats also but 

398.71 404.24 A: the democrats depress me so much i can't really follow electoral politics these days i have to say [laughter] 

400.59 401.22 B: (( uh )) 

403.55 407.43 B: yeah well the yeah the republicans kinda took over this uh 

407.89 411.41 B: you know i mean it's just republican all through the federal government 

410.77 418.36 A: yeah it's crazy it's uh they have they have house wait do wait do they have [noise] they they have all three 

418.75 423.13 A: branches now not branches but do they have the house and the senate 

418.90 419.82 B: um 

422.35 423.59 B: um 

423.63 434.37 A: who switched i remember right after the elections one of the republicans switched and gave the democrats a one person lead but then i think there were new elections and they lost that 

429.26 429.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

430.85 431.58 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

434.19 438.52 B: yeah there was there was both a a um it's that's that's it was both a 

438.74 449.92 B: a i mean right know both the senate and the house are republican you know and they're it's just you know there's it's just all through but this state is is uh democratic 

442.36 444.15 A: right right right 

449.58 450.75 A: right 

450.09 451.99 B: you know it's uh but uh 

452.62 458.97 B: but but but here we're on a record record budget it's like a thirty five plus billion dollar 

459.13 469.10 B: debt that the uh that the state's run up [laughter] and it's kinda frightening [laughter] you know what i mean but i i guess california has the the uh the fifth largest economy in the world 

468.59 470.37 A: (( [noise] right )) 

469.38 470.51 B: so uh 

470.62 473.24 B: you gotta look at things on that scale you know uh 

473.63 475.75 B: [sigh] oh but um 

476.63 482.19 B: you know i i don't know of any terrorist incidents on airplanes here in california so 

482.28 485.53 B: you know maybe heightened airline security 

485.67 492.27 B: uh is not all that important uh here in this state you know um 

492.06 505.92 A: i'd like to compare i mean i don't mind the security checks that people have to go through i mean i fly a fair bit and i've gone through them a lot and they don't bother me i'd like to compare to somewhere like israel where they have who always have like heightened security 

505.73 510.08 A: so and see like how intensive it is in comparison to that 

509.82 514.57 B: yeah i mean i i mean i ri- right where we live in mm uh 

512.15 521.17 A: or maybe i'm just in court [laughter] in courts a lot that like i have to go through the same kind of checks that are similar to airplane checks but i mean they're not like that big of a deal 

521.19 523.49 A: you know it doesn't seem to 

524.08 528.50 A: i don't know how effective it is but it doesn't seem to really be that much of a bother 

528.34 534.66 B: [sigh] yeah i mean like you know i i made one phone call already on this earlier so this is my second phone call 

534.67 540.24 B: and towards the end of the phone call like i started to comment that i would feel better if they put 

540.28 546.67 B: a guard near the cabin where the pilot and the copilot and the you know those people are 

546.75 550.30 B: and then uh maybe a guard towards the rear of the airplane 

550.07 551.24 A: (( mhm right )) 

550.78 552.64 B: you know and and uh 

552.50 562.42 A: well do they have the cabins locked now they were trying to get permission for the cabins to be locked and for the the uh pilots to be armed i remember 

562.11 564.50 B: mm well yeah i mean hopefully there'd be a 

564.78 569.83 B: you know hopefully they took at least an extra step after the you know the september eleventh 

569.80 570.74 A: right 

570.43 575.67 B: uh incident and you know uh as far as locking the cabins and that kind of thing 

575.97 583.90 B: but uh i i don't know how far you can go with that sort of thing and i mean i'm i'm confident that they have professionals who have 

585.00 587.32 B: put hours and weeks and months into 

587.43 590.46 B: you know uh analyzing 

591.01 595.71 B: uh airplane security and and moving towards the the uh uh 

592.69 593.91 A: right 

596.64 598.69 B: the best uh 

599.03 599.92 B: you know the best
