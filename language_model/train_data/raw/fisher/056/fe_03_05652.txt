2.17 3.49 A: hi scott 

3.54 4.58 B: (( how are you )) 

4.30 5.61 A: pretty good 

5.10 9.03 B: um so airport security what's your opinion 

10.07 12.04 A: talking about the airport 

11.86 13.17 B: i'm sorry 

12.56 14.77 A: we're talking about the airport security 

14.20 15.40 B: yes we are 

15.10 16.04 A: okay 

16.45 18.67 A: i i'm all for for it 

18.30 19.62 B: [laughter] 

19.18 21.84 A: i think it's a great thing i mean anything that will 

21.94 24.41 A: save our lives and bring back some of the the 

24.44 27.30 A: freedom that we took for granted before is good what 

26.76 39.37 B: um now what do you think about all the um the stuff that's been talked about how people have broken security they've brought guns on to airplanes and they've just passed right through it like like the the incur- incursions that've happened even with the tight security 

38.81 40.27 A: oh yeah yeah 

39.69 49.29 B: you know how they have all these like tight they ask you all these questions and they make sure you go through um all the radar detectors and sensor stuff but people 

49.32 54.67 B: especially employees have gotten on the plane past all the detections with with weapons 

55.52 63.23 A: well if if that's necessary to to avoid a catastrophe ah i think we should tolerate it and put up with whatever it takes 

63.35 68.27 A: a couple of hours or time so what we are going to be our lives if we do you know 

67.80 75.91 B: yeah oh no i don't disagree with you i think the airport security is a very good thing i was just trying to bring it up because um 

76.07 81.20 B: i just feel that you know there is a lot that has been done but i don't think it's good enough 

81.96 94.58 A: i i well i i think it is i i've been over several times and and ah the wait is annoying but it's for our own benefit so i i accept it as a necessity you know i've 

94.49 105.67 A: talked to several people who travel a lot maybe travel once or twice a month and they say that the thank god they have it they're back back in the air again flying where before they were afraid to go you know 

98.18 99.16 B: right 

105.62 114.53 B: true and it is safer to fly than drive so or at least there are less um deaths from a plane crash than there are from driving 

114.95 117.38 B: so i guess that's another good thing for it 

116.90 127.13 A: oh yeah well you know you you you just never know i i can't believe you know when you hear the report about the man that had the bomb in his shoe now they had to check your shoes 

126.80 127.76 B: yeah 

127.14 138.47 A: it it it doesn't bother me at all because i thank god they found that they found out that it was legit that he did have the bomb in his shoe and and ah that he could have caused an explosion you know 

138.29 141.83 B: right now um now where are you from may i ask 

141.68 143.90 A: i'm i'm from cincinnati ohio 

143.48 145.22 B: oh wow okay 

145.48 147.13 B: and you travel often 

147.48 148.39 A: pardon 

148.10 149.57 B: do you travel often 

149.72 152.01 A: not much any more i used to 

151.83 152.74 B: okay 

152.36 160.27 A: i used to travel quite a lot but ah i used to go go back and forth to new york quite a bit when when i when i was working i'm retired now 

157.50 159.67 B: yeah um 

159.93 161.20 B: oh yeah 

160.59 162.41 A: (( and to me it's i )) 

162.48 176.07 A: will tell you but i'm a great believer in in this country and i think that i'm a little bit irked about all of the things that have happened to us and if it's just an inconvenience at the airport that's going to help save this that's fine with me you know 

165.37 166.37 B: [laughter] 

175.43 180.10 B: right i agree with you on the fact that you know i really think that the 

180.09 193.17 B: you know the airport if they try to make our lives safer it's a good thing um but like but the thing is though like i travel from boston to chicago pretty often because i'm a student at north western university 

189.75 190.68 A: uh-huh 

192.53 193.50 A: uh-huh 

193.10 197.69 B: and every time i leave boston you know security is very tight 

197.46 200.87 B: um they often make sure that you know 

200.76 206.01 B: they're checking people very very closely but every time i leave o'hare 

205.91 216.04 B: um chicago i like it's very very weak and i just keep thinking to myself that this that they're not doing a good enough job and that it needs to be tighter 

216.32 229.37 A: yeah well i i tell you i'm in favor of it if if if they found any cases where they they are not doing the job i think they either get rid of them or hire more people or or reprimand those that didn't do the job and get rid of 'em you know 

229.03 230.12 B: right 

230.00 237.72 A: this is so important to all of us you know and i think the air the airlines have gone bankrupt because people are afraid to fly you know 

237.99 242.90 A: what we'd we'd be in one hell of a way if we didn't have a plane you know we'd have to walk 

242.63 244.32 B: (( mhm )) 

243.61 245.25 A: that's good 

245.37 249.77 A: i'm glad you called me i hope that i can help in some way 

247.14 248.18 B: [laughter] 

249.82 250.71 A: (( ah )) 

250.90 256.37 A: i i certainly enjoy ah these little chats and i think it's a good thing to do you know 

255.97 260.24 B: yeah i agree with you i think we should have a little more though to talk [laughter] 

259.87 268.32 A: i used to work in in a job where i did focus group discussions where i would get groups together and we would talk about various things 

268.28 276.46 A: and boy i tell you we have learned an awful lot from the people and that is what you've got to do you know what people's what people's attitudes are 

273.52 274.56 B: yeah 

275.89 284.54 B: and i'm sure each generation are like even groups of ten years of age have different opinions as a whole in each subject matter 

284.40 285.69 A: yeah 

285.24 286.16 B: so 

285.75 296.20 A: well i'm i'm in favor of it and if i had to give a a nickel on every buck that i spend in order to to bring pay them a little bit better make 'em do a better job i'll do it 

295.95 305.63 B: [laughter] yeah i mean as would i unfortunately i mean do you know how much is spent on like airport defence and like security 

306.30 311.19 A: oh not not much in the past couple of months because i haven't been travelling since i retired you know 

310.47 317.36 B: yeah um it's i mean unfortunately it's hard to tell i mean the government really 

315.78 320.37 A: i used to i used to pay i used to pay five six hundred dollars a month when i was travelling with my business 

320.47 323.26 B: oh you mean for an airplane ticket 

322.83 326.51 A: oh yeah i'd i'd get an airplane ticket and fly to new york sometimes 

326.34 328.29 B: and you'd pay five hundred dollars 

328.22 331.06 A: huh oh i paid at least five hundred 

330.97 336.64 B: yeah but but this is for um oh yeah but this is like to the airline it wasn't necessarily 

336.05 346.38 A: oh no no no that was that was for the airline ticket you know to to go you you have the ticket and then you go over there and then they inspect you and then say let's see okay you can go or you can't go you know 

345.99 347.37 B: right 

346.91 349.43 A: (( that's that's good how do you like it in north western )) 

349.44 351.87 B: um how do i like it 

351.39 353.56 A: did did you get your degree yet 

352.99 356.13 B: oh no i'm not done yet i'm still a student 

355.52 357.53 A: (( what what are you going to major in )) 

357.07 360.01 B: um i am a premed econ major 

359.75 361.07 A: (( premed that's a )) 

360.48 363.97 B: yeah so yeah [laughter] 

361.76 363.17 A: good idea 

363.25 364.64 A: we need 'em 

364.06 365.36 B: i'm sorry 

364.74 366.49 A: we need them very bad 

365.90 375.70 B: yeah [laughter] thank you i mean i'm really interested in the pediatrics so i might become um either just a pediatrician or even better a paed- a pediatric surgeon 

376.11 383.57 A: i'm i'm proud of the fact that i was a scout master for thirty years and one of my boys is a is an orthopedic surgeon 

383.31 384.53 B: oh wow 

383.91 398.42 A: and boy i tell you you're just proud of these kids and i tell you they they know what they're doing they're they're they're our future too just as in security that they're giving us at the airport that's our future that's our future either we have it or we don't you know 

398.27 401.03 B: and it's such a rewarding you know career 

401.32 408.53 B: too in my opinion to like make a difference in the world i think being a doctor and stuff is one of the ways to do it 

408.45 409.68 A: what was that again 

409.47 415.84 B: i i'm saying one of the reasons why i'm interested is because being a doctor it's a great way to make a difference in the world 

415.52 416.64 A: yeah 

416.07 426.58 B: and so that's one of the reasons why i'm doing it like um there is also the option of business but i feel as though if i go into that i'm not really helping individuals as much as i could if i were a doctor 

426.33 427.20 A: yeah 

426.66 427.41 B: so 

427.62 429.53 A: (( well i will tell you that's )) 

429.62 439.20 A: nice to have a a feeling to to help individuals to help this country and to make sure you vote that's all you don't have anything to say if you don't vote 

438.89 450.54 B: right yeah no i yeah like in massachusetts there's a very strong believer in voting and like and like trying to make a difference mostly like the democratic liberal individual so 

450.34 455.53 A: yeah well you know to me ah i think the thing is that there's too much emphasis on 

455.40 469.75 A: whether you're a a democrat or a republican and i think that when we elect elect these legislat- legislation people in the legislature that ah they should they're in there to do a job and at the time they get in there it should be nonpartisan you 

469.54 471.70 A: know they shouldn't hold ah 

471.99 477.33 A: their own conventions because of party over a good idea such as 

477.64 485.81 A: better security at the airport you know they say oh no no no the democrats said this or the republicans said that and we should have did this a long time ago 

479.30 480.23 B: i know 

485.93 489.51 A: and that's just they're they're trying to get elected again you know 

489.16 491.89 B: but that's politics right there unfortunately 

490.69 496.65 A: oh yeah i i i tell you we wish we have ah more pat- patriots 

496.96 501.87 A: patriots and and and and less politicians then we would have a better country you know 

501.65 508.04 B: i would definitely agree with you unfortunately i think that possibility is very thin and 

507.41 522.03 A: well i i think they're going to get better because i i think right now we can see improvement and ah people are getting used to the the the security checks at the airport they they know it's an inconvenience and they have to leave an hour early they have to 

521.98 533.30 A: maybe sometimes be held up a little bit but the the people that i talk with in charge who just come back and stuff like they said it wasn't too bad they took a book and read it and everything was fine while i was sitting there you know 

533.18 539.68 B: i know i don't mind the wait at all but like for me personally my interest in travelling has definitely gone down 

539.55 540.39 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

539.90 547.87 B: because like it's like you have to get there i mean it took a whole day to travel like you had to get there really early you know make sure things are okay 

547.70 560.17 B: and then you know go through airport security and then you wait even longer and then you get your flight and then you you know it it takes time which i don't mind but but but i would i would definitely sacrifice two hours of my life 

555.71 557.52 A: oh no no how 

559.49 560.72 A: old are you 

560.98 561.94 B: i'm sorry 

561.74 562.90 A: how old are you 

562.46 565.08 B: i am nineteen i'll be twenty in two months 

563.89 568.04 A: well good for you that's that's the guys we need in this country 

567.48 569.37 B: [laughter] thank you very much 

568.39 571.95 A: did did did you sign up for the reserve or anything like that 

571.05 573.78 B: um i think i have actually yeah 

573.31 574.48 A: (( you have )) 

573.96 575.84 B: i definitely have yeah 

575.23 578.10 A: oh that's good i'm retired military too 

577.84 579.13 B: oh really 

578.57 580.75 A: retired navy chief twenty years 

580.57 586.12 B: i actually hope though that i'm not called up for the reserves only 'cause i feel as though i'd make a bigger difference 

585.65 599.89 A: yeah i hope you don't have to be called up because you know i i i think right now that the we've got a good army and a good marine navy and so forth and they're great they're great they're doing the job and we're paying 'em and because they're 

598.37 599.20 B: right
