79.79 81.76 B: yeah um 

81.83 83.56 B: i i don't i guess

88.90 91.57 A: huh what i i didn't understand you 

91.73 97.75 B: okay the palestinians are [mn] pretty much broke compared to the amount of money that the israelis have 

97.59 98.46 A: mhm 

98.13 102.89 B: and they feel like the only way they can do anything is with these 

103.28 104.29 B: cheap 

104.47 114.84 B: bombs [mn] blowing shit up blowing blowing all sorts of people and places up because then they'll be heard and and

123.74 126.91 B: so you think get rid of the groups and then peace will come arafat ah 

126.16 135.45 A: if you get rid of all the little groups you know like with the [cough] what's his name that we've already gotten rid of and slowly taking out his whole group 

134.38 135.92 B: ((  )) 

135.54 136.94 A: no the other one 

136.96 139.54 B: ((  )) 

138.36 140.20 A: (( the one who lives in caves )) 

140.70 141.67 B: (( each other nothing's )) 

141.50 153.48 A: bin laden yeah you know we once you get rid of that group and then his followers and then the other side's group and their followers and just have it to where it's just the civilians 

154.13 161.87 A: and the new elected government officials without these other little militant groups then maybe someone can sit down and harass 

162.35 164.59 A: rationalize stuff out [mn] 

164.67 166.69 A: (( that makes )) 

165.72 166.78 B: (( ever going to )) 

167.39 169.33 A: (( the only way )) 

172.59 180.86 A: it's going to happen is if we step in we say you're just abolished you're gone you're history you're same thing 

172.60 173.26 B: (( happen )) 

173.37 174.43 B: yeah 

181.21 187.04 A: h- here's new this is all going to be new this is all going to be new now you guys sit down and hash it out 

188.93 190.94 B: yeah um 

192.50 193.76 B: i don't 

193.95 196.67 B: [mn] i don't know if that will ever happen because of 

196.81 200.75 B: (( whether i guess we're not really to talk about whether it will happen but what we think will happen )) 

200.61 201.47 A: yeah 

200.77 201.84 B: um 

202.51 210.35 B: i yeah the is- the palestinians as for our involvement like the u._s. involvement um 

210.12 220.12 A: put it this way i've been involved in many things like this in you know just personal life half the time you cannot resolve a situation without a middle man 

222.73 224.54 B: you mean like without a 

223.23 230.24 A: so what they you need is a middle man whether it be us or somebody else that doesn't have an interest in that country 

230.46 236.31 A: you know something that can't you know someone that doesn't need to gain from that country anything 

237.16 244.74 A: that way you know neither side can say hey i'll give you this if you go our way i'll give you or the other guy go i'll give you this if you go our way 

237.24 238.06 B: uh-huh 

244.88 247.31 A: you know somebody that don't need nothing 

247.87 251.25 A: might be like us we don't really need anything from them 

253.40 258.32 B: so you you mean there needs to be some be some middle peace negotiator or what 

259.18 262.15 A: what you need is somebody that has a clear head 

262.47 264.90 A: that knows right from wrong 

265.47 266.82 A: to sit down and say 

266.88 271.13 A: this sounds fair that don't sound fair you know 

271.43 276.32 A: to hash it out between the two you know these two say okay this is my proposal this is mine 

271.62 272.71 B: yeah 

276.47 277.47 A: okay 

277.84 285.91 A: now they're both not fair so you need somebody in there to say okay well let's tweak this one this way let's tweak this one this way how does that sound to you guys 

285.97 295.93 A: yeah that sounds a little better okay then well now let's work on this one and this one you know until you got everything fifty fifty or you know at least where both sides agree okay everything's fine 

296.73 298.43 A: then once that's all done 

298.49 300.28 A: then both sides adhere to it 

301.85 310.31 A: but you need somebody to sit there [mn] that will have a clear mind because when you know w- when you get angry your mind ain't clear no more 

309.56 310.40 B: no 

311.00 316.85 A: so what you do is you got to have a third party there that really is not on either side 

316.89 321.11 A: or involved in the argument they're just sitting here refereeing 

321.25 334.09 A: is basically what they're doing they're saying okay you can do this okay that's fine okay this that that sounds reasonable basically what that person does is keep everybody calm so they can think right 

333.33 335.41 B: so not the united nations 

335.53 337.14 A: (( hm )) 

336.49 338.02 B: the united nations 

338.09 339.47 A: ah what was that now 

339.53 340.64 B: the u._n. 

341.05 344.18 A: that could be us or it could be anybody else 

345.65 346.44 B: mm 

346.86 352.19 A: yeah i mean you know if you want you can have more than one middle man you can have three 

352.71 361.56 A: that way you could you know in a way make sure that one person ain't being you know bought in a pocket and 

361.97 364.05 A: you know keep on eye on each other 

365.11 366.02 A: (( you know )) 

365.21 366.24 B: yeah 

368.74 369.67 B: (( ah )) 

369.35 371.96 A: or if you want have everybody get together 

375.23 377.22 A: but you know it's going to take 

377.35 378.77 A: 'cause see ah 

379.78 383.30 A: like all these bombings like israel bombs this guy [mn] 

383.77 386.34 A: you know back and forth right 

386.46 387.41 B: yeah 

386.85 398.89 A: it's because it's not the civilians that are doing it it's the military groups you know the the rogue military groups not the actual military military 

398.76 407.19 A: you know like our united states navy and stuff like that it's not their ground forces it's just the militants and bin laden's bombers you know 

407.94 416.12 A: that's all it is is it's a militant group they're just going out doing what they you know oh well you hit us we're going to hit you 

416.31 417.89 A: but see the thing is but 

416.62 419.72 B: well what what about the israelis' army 

420.01 422.00 A: but see the thing is though 

422.74 425.34 A: is the ar- israeli army goes in 

425.64 428.60 A: and fights but the thing is though 

428.72 429.81 A: they're 

430.26 434.44 A: not paying attention to what the hell they're doing that's the only problem 

434.79 438.69 A: 'cause what it is is the palestine's is the militant groups 

439.81 444.27 A: you've got you've got your good civilians [mn] civilians and then you've got your militant groups 

445.10 449.31 A: and it's hard to find a militant group that blends in very well with your civilians 

451.53 452.42 B: uh-huh 

452.30 457.61 A: and there's almost no way of solving that one to a point 

457.97 461.33 A: because of that you don't know who's who 

467.53 472.35 B: so what could be done and should the u._s. even be involved 

471.57 474.84 A: what can be done and should like i said 

475.50 479.97 A: u._s. is one of the best probably to be involved 

481.99 483.70 A: 'cause how many times 

482.02 484.59 B: but isn't the u._s. biased be- 

484.29 485.12 A: huh 

485.02 493.77 B: the u._s. is biased probably naturally because we have many more jewish people in this country powerful jewish people than palestinians 

493.16 496.00 A: well that's that's true too but [cough] 

497.37 500.14 A: the thing is is it depends on who you send 

503.38 506.33 A: (( and who they're influenced by i )) 

503.53 504.36 B: (( um )) 

506.53 511.66 A: guess that's the best way i would think about it are you with me 

507.14 508.24 B: so do you think 

512.33 518.13 A: send somebody that's not really republican that sits down and thinks rati- you know rationally and commonsense wise 

519.26 525.92 A: 'cause me personally if i was sitting down with them i'd say fine you got a problem here and you got a problem here let's do this let's split everything fifty fifty 

525.98 528.21 A: you get this half you get this half 

529.55 533.86 A: you know ten thousand square feet you know split it into five thousand square feet 

536.08 536.93 A: you know 

537.04 539.00 B: yeah 

538.55 540.86 A: just split it up 

541.91 542.70 B: (( mm )) 

542.95 544.64 A: (( all right )) 

546.31 551.10 A: i got a picky son i'm trying to figure out what to get him to eat 

551.46 553.35 B: [laughter] 

554.72 555.96 B: uh 

559.20 560.33 B: so 

561.44 562.87 B: yeah i don't know 

563.04 565.26 B: i don't really foresee 

566.05 569.00 B: there ever not being conflict 

569.21 572.17 B: in the middle east um 

570.95 576.77 A: well there's been there's been times times of peace and granted it wasn't 

577.54 578.83 A: all 

580.01 581.86 A: that 

582.55 584.69 A: (( but )) 

587.74 589.19 A: but anyway 

589.71 590.64 A: i mean 

590.85 594.37 A: when there was a little bit of peace i mean it wasn't all 

594.78 598.77 A: i mean it wasn't no major shit going on but it wasn't
