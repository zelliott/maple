7.00 7.88 A: and so 

8.24 12.24 A: yeah this is interesting i've never done uh this is my first one 

11.83 14.05 B: mm same with my me 

13.68 18.35 A: okay so um what [laughter] what are we supposed to do are we supposed to just talk like 

17.26 28.33 B: we're suppos- we're suppos- the topic that is they said was something about athletes getting ridiculous salaries and how we feel about it and how them striking for money or something like that 

27.68 36.65 A: right how we feel about um their striking and how do we feel about their salaries how do you feel about the um ha- salaries that um 

32.24 33.17 B: right 

37.11 38.95 A: that um uh 

39.37 40.46 A: they get 

40.57 50.48 B: uh i think the the majority of 'em the sports is ridiculous um it's something like seventy percen- five percent of the team's revenue goes to all the players 

44.63 45.55 A: yeah 

50.58 65.26 B: and most that's the reason most of these sport teams don't even make money they lose money is because they've just hi- such high salary caps you know over the years i mean it's grown exponentially if you look even 

65.43 73.27 B: twenty years ago it was like one tenth of what it is today it's just ridiculous how much they've gotten out of hand and i mean alex rodriguez getting 

73.18 83.72 B: i don't know how much the exact number was like a hundred and eighty million or whatever it was i mean what one player's worth that amount of money i mean who how no matter how great he is michael jordan didn't even get that amount of money 

83.67 97.29 B: you know and he was the top of his game so i mean who's to say that that someone is you know obviously it's an open market but who's to say that someone's worth that amount of money you could buy probably a whole team for a hundred and eighty million dollars you know 

95.87 110.05 A: mm see i i'm just suspicious about um claims that they don't make um that that that the teams don't make money i mean they um [mn] they wouldn't continue being in this business and they wouldn't continue playing in these paying these mm um 

102.45 103.76 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

109.90 124.07 A: players if they weren't making some some money off of the off you know the television contracts um i just don't think that anybody would stay in that business they would you know move onto another business if they weren't making some money um 

114.69 115.63 B: mhm 

122.64 124.67 B: mhm you mean the owners 

124.04 125.28 A: the owners 

124.90 138.18 B: mhm well i fee- really i feel i don't do it as a hobby to to m- sounds like to me i mean more than a you know as a passion you know they they're business people that made you know were had success in business world 

125.41 126.55 A: yeah 

138.13 143.05 B: and decided to you know that they wanted to you know own a sports franchise 

143.10 146.80 B: and um although i'm sure they run it like a business 

146.85 148.80 B: i i just i mean 

148.88 151.23 B: even though they do have ridiculous um 

151.38 152.88 B: (( salaries [mn] )) 

153.17 155.41 B: and seventy five percent of the you know the 

155.42 162.11 B: gross goes to them and stuff that leaves twenty five percent to go to the rest the operations and everything else i mean 

162.26 167.88 B: i- it's a very small margin [mn] you know it's i mean i wouldn't be surprised 

168.01 174.05 B: i- if there were some teams in the black but i don't think any team is making serious money 

174.27 175.13 A: (( well )) 

174.30 177.91 B: even with all the you know revenue streams [noise] 

177.97 180.77 A: i don't know i mean i look at it as um 

180.86 185.24 A: i i don't i look at sports figures as entertainers 

184.74 186.07 B: mhm 

185.44 186.38 A: um 

186.24 200.38 A: and um i think that they work really hard um to get to um a place where they can make a living doing this and there's a really short shelf life for these entertainers you know suddenly you wake up and you're 

189.34 190.28 B: right 

196.80 198.82 B: (( mhm that's true mhm mhm )) 

200.19 213.44 A: you know because you're thirty eight years old you're too old to to to work in your chosen profession and so in some ways i see that kind of pay as retroactive pay um and also something to um you know 

205.40 206.42 B: right 

209.62 210.61 B: mhm 

213.51 217.61 A: to to cover people for the rest of their lives you know they 

217.78 231.38 A: the the s- sp- sporting kind of dictates that to when people reach a certain age they're suppose to just change careers well sometimes you know these people aren't suited to do anything else and so then what you know and um 

227.76 229.26 B: (( [noise] right mhm )) 

229.41 231.03 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

231.32 242.51 A: an- an- and ultimately to me the the proof is in the the obvious enjoyment that um people get i mean specifically just you know americans 

241.98 243.05 B: right 

242.42 247.27 A: um you know the enjoyment that americans get from these entertainers 

246.43 247.59 B: mhm 

247.12 259.10 A: you know there's a lot of value in that these people are providing and i know it's not a real popular um point of view but i i just think if if they're asking for it and they're getting paid this 

250.92 251.93 B: right 

258.55 259.90 B: mhm 

258.94 263.81 A: amount of money then there must be money somewhere to pay them for it 

263.24 268.18 B: well i mean yeah there is money i mean i'm not saying i'm saying after you know 

268.17 279.67 B: there's obviously a lot of money coming in but i'm saying the majority goes listen you've got um basketball in n._b._a. minimum salary is like three hundred grand that's the guy sitting at the end of the bench paying 

279.53 289.99 B: playing two minutes a game or whatever it is and he's making three hundred thousand dollars you know i don't know baseball's like two hundred something i mean it's for you know 

290.56 300.01 B: for nothing i mean that's [laughter] you know that's the minimum you're gonna make is three hundred grand up to you know whatever the highest player in the team is probably five ten million 

299.94 309.80 B: a year i mean that's a lot of overhead i mean if you if you're in a corporation like that with your all your players making you know a minimum of that kind of money 

310.04 310.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

310.80 313.66 B: you know you'd be out of business it's 

313.81 316.22 B: they do it obviously because 

316.31 319.75 B: the uh brand loyalty is you know 

320.09 328.87 B: i'm going where the money is nowadays it's not like oh i wanna stay you know i got signed by this team i wanna stay with them i'm loyal to the fans 

328.74 342.76 B: you know it's like oh oakland just uh this other city's gonna pay me more i'm moving there that's what you see a lot you know a lot of days now it's all about money it has nothing to do with the game it has nothing to do with the entertaining the fans you know 

333.81 334.84 A: mhm 

343.11 347.69 B: essentially you know it's they're all free agents and so to speak 

345.16 346.11 A: it's the 

346.90 359.10 A: mm right yeah it's their business i mean they may be entertaining us and it may be an unusual job that they have but they're they are in it for the money in in the same way that you know somebody who 

349.46 350.56 B: yeah 

358.96 362.97 A: you know works in a meat packing plant is in it for the money it's their job 

361.71 362.59 B: mhm 

364.07 373.42 B: well yeah but they're not entertainers you know they're not there to like make sure all the other meat factory workers are have a smile on their face and you know 

366.83 368.10 A: no but what 

374.05 377.47 B: the- that's two different uh you know things 

377.47 382.20 A: nah i don't i don't really think so i think that it is a job i mean we may 

378.02 379.00 B: (( you know )) 

382.01 396.10 A: glamorize it and and project our own stuff onto it but ultimately these people are born with a talent and um we get excitement out of um watching this talent and display and um and they you know if 

388.93 389.88 B: mhm 

392.74 393.59 B: right 

396.49 400.38 A: they wanna be paid to to do it 

399.41 400.82 B: mhm 

401.30 405.23 A: and um i i i think it's also just part of um 

405.34 415.48 A: it's part of the american you know dream in a way too i mean 'cause a lot a lot of these peo- most of these people are people that um um 

409.38 410.20 B: right 

415.38 422.78 A: you know we still live in a country where if your grandparents have money or your parents have money the whole world is open to you 

422.39 423.50 B: mhm 

422.89 433.61 A: you know you have an opportunity to be groomed and shaped to go to the best schools in the world you have you know a built in network waiting for you of you know 

429.38 430.26 B: right 

433.39 447.99 A: um parent you know friends of your parents waiting to give you opportunities you know in wor- in your chosen field and you know this is a country where um people who aren't born to wealthy families don't really have the same opportunities 

437.20 438.11 B: mhm 

447.63 448.53 B: mhm 

447.79 460.12 A: and so a lot of these people that are a lot of these athletes are people that would never ever have an opportunity to have this kind of a life a- and then p- and pass this life onto their own children 

455.40 456.53 B: right 

459.60 467.65 B: mhm so where do you draw the line um i mean how much is too much or is you know do you wanna pay a guy five hundred million is that okay i mean yeah 

466.98 481.68 A: i think it's what the market will allow i think if suddenly um the uh um teams are losing m- money and they the teams fold and there's no more uh teams for anybody to play or it starts to look like the competition 

479.25 480.16 B: mhm 

481.46 490.60 A: it's not competitive any longer um then yeah people will begin to say sorry you know this is how much a basketball player makes period 

489.70 501.65 B: okay but let's say you know these contracts keep going up and up ticket prices keep going up and up and up less people keep going to the games you know wh- w- they all have an adverse effect you know 

501.28 510.02 A: well yeah i mean the same thing i mean if suddenly the peo- the the um stands the seats aren't being filled then people will need to um 

510.32 522.00 A: take a look at that and and they'll have to you know make decisions but right now i think um you know the popular teams are supported by the fans and people do go out and and attend these games 

518.41 519.39 B: mhm 

521.82 522.67 B: right 

521.99 526.79 A: it it's the same thing with broadway you know i mean you know 

527.42 538.08 A: yeah everything's gotten really expensive um and the and a seat to see a broadway show is a hundred bucks but you know the top musicals on broadway people are willing to pay it 

533.21 534.49 B: mhm 

537.57 544.28 B: right yeah but that's you know i think uh i guess i see the difference is that baseball's always been a family 

544.34 554.12 B: t- pastime you bring the kids you know you bring the family whereas broadway's always like you go with your wife or you know it's a night out um 

554.41 562.26 B: so i that's m- i guess i that seem i see that in a different light and baseball games you bring the whole family you know it's 

562.20 576.21 B: kid friendly and you know you can bring everyone which is yeah you could bring your kids to to broadway but that's not you know they they're not targeting that demographic and it's not being marketed as you know a kid uh venue 

575.29 584.24 A: well the last time i went to uh um a baseball game um i don't remember exactly how much i paid but i remember it was pretty affordable for all the fun that i had 

583.70 585.81 B: mhm what what team 

585.69 594.59 A: um [mn] it was the uh uh it was in atlantic city it was the atlantic city um surf so kin- you know it's not major league it's minor league 

591.58 592.47 B: mhm 

593.62 594.54 B: right 

595.15 598.46 B: oh right so mi- yeah minor league i mean that'll cost you five 

599.13 599.99 B: eight bucks a
