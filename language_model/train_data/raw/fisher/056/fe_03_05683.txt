9.49 10.40 A: yeah 

11.05 12.15 B: um 

11.17 12.04 A: so 

12.66 13.92 B: i um 

13.38 15.65 A: so our topic of the day 

15.47 16.78 B: yes 

16.67 17.77 A: [laughter] 

18.00 20.46 A: my third attempt they've had uh 

21.39 26.57 A: you know i've accepted two other calls and they nev- didn't line someone up to talk to so 

26.58 28.14 B: oh 

27.62 31.30 A: but hey who who knows how it operates so 

30.90 32.19 B: i know 

32.38 33.18 A: (( yes )) 

32.95 34.48 B: i know um 

35.14 35.93 B: (( so )) 

36.03 38.29 B: (( i ah )) 

38.77 45.14 B: think there'll never i tend to be a pessimist about these things human nature being 

42.64 44.23 A: [laughter] 

44.92 48.73 A: but is it really being a pessimist or is it really just being a realist 

48.93 50.71 B: good point 

50.06 53.25 A: because i you know i tend to be a 

54.14 63.05 A: i'm not definitely not a pessimist but i just don't see how they'll uh how they'll they will ever have peace in in what they want to call the middle east 

63.74 65.38 B: i truly agree 

65.52 67.21 A: be- because it's just 

67.24 70.69 A: everything is so entrenched entrenched i'm sorry 

70.71 72.68 A: and almost inbred that 

71.48 73.90 B: (( yeah )) 

73.26 77.54 A: you know the the the goals of each side are just 

78.29 84.83 A: so ah contradictory to each other that ah it it just never can be 

86.46 87.94 B: i agree 

88.40 89.65 B: um 

91.37 93.22 B: and uh [cough] 

93.37 97.46 B: i think that ah i had a friend 

97.58 99.31 B: talking about this 

99.89 105.39 B: coincidentally and he was saying that he thought it would just get increasingly worse for a lot of reasons you know just 

105.65 111.52 B: many of them what you were saying and what in the you know the next ten years or less 

112.06 116.65 B: that things won't have improved but they'll have gotten worse 

117.07 118.90 A: yeah i can see that [mn] 

117.24 121.96 B: and and sadly i think that's true 

122.40 123.99 B: you know i mean 

125.03 131.42 B: ah i'm just glad i'm not eighteen right now and you know if they start to draft again and all that 

131.62 133.79 A: right well i think i think 

133.84 136.71 A: you know like you said it's sadly that 

136.79 140.39 A: you know they can't have peace and you know you think about it 

140.42 148.43 A: [mn] you know if you could just you know if they snap your fingers and say okay this this this this and this you know are done deals and we'll have peace 

148.95 150.83 A: even if you could do that 

149.16 152.28 B: (( yeah )) 

151.66 154.65 A: it would still explode after that because 

154.92 157.51 A: like i said before the goals of 

157.94 160.45 A: you know the groups of people there are so 

161.03 164.27 A: um well they're foreign to us 

164.04 165.11 B: yes 

164.28 166.28 A: and they're and they're 

167.44 170.18 A: so um 

170.46 180.65 A: um i don't know what the word i want to use is so aggressive and um like i said contradictory is a bad word but it's as close as i'll get to close 

178.27 179.52 B: (( yes )) 

180.57 190.39 A: contradictory to what is what is going on one group wants this and just wants the other group gone i mean that doesn't it doesn't form a basis for negotiations 

186.64 188.09 B: right 

190.79 197.97 A: you know if you can't negotiate then you're not going to get anywhere you know right now the pale- palestinians have no leverage 'cause they have nothing 

198.24 200.55 A: nothing to give up other than 

200.93 205.23 A: you know the terror that they hold that's their their leverage is terror 

205.51 210.18 A: and and that's they've already given up their land to you know be occupied and all and it's just a 

208.94 212.83 B: (( right )) 

210.55 211.68 A: (( a )) 

212.11 215.36 A: recurring cycle no one's willing to say okay we'll stop 

215.88 219.80 A: but they can't stop 'cause they got to retaliate for the last time so it's 

219.84 221.66 A: just going to keep going and going 

222.12 222.94 A: but 

223.06 224.75 B: and it's too bad 

225.55 226.86 B: that um 

226.87 228.19 B: we are so 

230.06 237.60 B: [sigh] just i don't know human nature itself is so aggressive 'cause i was watching something on t._v. you know and [sigh] 

237.87 238.71 B: just 

238.98 243.38 B: the damage all this causes and innocent people and 

242.21 246.95 A: oh no question that's the thing i you know i i'd like to get an accurate 

247.19 248.84 A: percentage of say 

249.08 254.51 A: the people in the middle east who would you know what percentage just wants peace just hey 

254.83 265.93 A: give us peace granted we ought to give up something what percentage really wants peace i i don't know what that really is it seems to me that the percentage is too large to really um 

264.60 268.02 B: (( yeah )) 

267.07 269.96 A: [mn] that or it's too small to get things done 

270.07 272.53 A: there's just too many who don't want peace 

271.94 273.39 B: right 

272.70 277.31 A: for any for any cost they don't want to give up anything they want more and more but they don't want peace 

277.81 281.67 A: unless you know the other side gives in to every goal they have 

277.96 278.82 B: (( i know )) 

281.76 283.56 A: which will never happen 

284.21 285.78 B: oh i know 

286.04 287.33 B: and uh 

287.72 289.15 B: (( but )) 

289.27 292.20 B: just think as 

292.88 299.67 B: you know technology advances and we become more powerful and you know and like 

300.78 303.91 B: other countries become more powerful it's just frightening 

304.28 307.96 B: that we can't i mean 

308.13 311.45 B: this is [mn] these are not the colonies any more and we 

312.33 314.28 B: um you know it's just 

312.36 313.70 A: right 

314.49 316.07 B: it's frightening to think of 

316.64 318.02 B: the outcome 

318.42 321.36 B: as we all get so powerful you know each nation 

322.62 324.14 B: and um 

324.70 326.20 B: i just you know 

327.24 330.35 B: shudder to think in ten years or less 

330.11 331.46 A: or less 

331.07 332.82 B: or less yeah 

332.29 336.44 A: well i think with you know like you say with technology and and the power 

336.99 343.74 A: things will happen quicker as opposed to ten years it'll take four years as opposed to twenty years it'll take eleven years 

343.39 344.87 B: good point 

343.83 345.29 A: everything will happen 

345.34 352.98 A: quicker and quicker you know just because you know technology and the power and and the cycles are just that much quicker 

353.51 357.10 A: information travels that much faster so it's just going to make everything 

353.64 355.61 B: yeah 

357.33 363.38 A: that we'd anticipate happening you know twenty years ago would have happened in ten years is now going to happen in four years 

363.43 365.61 A: and that's almost makes it even scarier 

365.57 366.65 B: yes 

366.74 371.92 A: that you know whatever might happen and you know you're saying ten years you 

372.32 374.64 A: know it could happen tomorrow that it just 

374.94 379.68 A: everyone just says okay forget it we're just going to um 

379.70 384.32 A: put it all on the table and you know lay it all on the line and and and go for broke which 

384.12 385.39 B: right 

384.39 387.20 A: and it once someone decides to do that 

387.35 390.57 A: um it's really going to be ugly 

392.34 396.58 B: and it's too bad that people can't sit down 

397.28 398.08 A: well 

397.41 400.40 B: and discuss these things 

399.73 404.33 A: that's another thing who do you talk to who you know who represents who and 

403.58 405.40 B: yeah 

404.54 406.70 A: why can't you just sit down like 

406.72 407.53 A: (( you know )) 

407.69 412.65 A: get this upenn group to go and do a phone thing over there so people can talk to each other 

412.62 414.10 B: yeah 

413.49 414.49 A: (( you know )) 

414.18 416.04 B: you know because um 

416.50 417.55 B: when i was 

417.72 422.83 B: watching this news broadcast it's like they're just people 

422.18 433.04 A: that well that's see that's the thing they are they're just me and you they could be sitting in their homes just bsing they could be cook- well it's obviously early in the morning there but 

425.71 427.15 B: yeah 

429.23 430.49 B: yeah 

433.10 435.86 A: they do all the same they're going to do all the same things we do 

435.94 438.18 B: and they could be yeah 

436.15 437.02 A: they all 

437.58 443.36 A: they put their pants on you know one leg at a time they cook breakf- they're cooking breakfast in an hour or so 'cause i don't know 

443.48 444.69 A: it's about 

444.91 448.33 A: six or so i don't know what the ah the time difference is but 

448.62 451.08 A: you know they do all same things we do 

451.80 453.14 A: it's just that they 

451.90 460.15 B: they probably yeah they're probably talking the same way you know things are going to get worse and what are we going to do and 

456.62 457.50 A: (( really )) 

458.75 470.36 A: right you're you're exactly right and it's so foreign to us because it's you know it's somewhere else there it's in their back yard and front yard and um on their buses obviously and 

460.30 461.75 B: yeah 

466.59 467.81 B: yes 

470.78 473.65 A: in their marketplaces and restaurants 

473.77 476.39 A: and here we don't you know we don't know what that is 

476.73 480.24 B: yeah 'cause like i they were showing 

478.20 479.24 A: yeah you know 

480.26 485.12 B: newscasts and you know it was right in their backyard as you were saying 

484.60 485.38 A: (( right i )) 

485.56 498.41 B: and ah the um the hilton over there you know was damaged and it it's easy when it's over there and it's easy when it's somebody else's yeah 

485.90 486.58 A: mean 

491.17 492.11 A: right 

494.00 496.02 A: correct that's correct 

496.15 500.43 A: you you know you can get on a bus in downtown seattle and 

500.68 506.11 A: for the most part ninety nine point nine percent of the time you know full well you'll get on it and 

506.31 510.56 A: you know you'll get from i don't know seattle at all but you can get from downtown to 

510.80 512.67 A: wherever you need to go and 

512.74 515.39 A: there's not you don't have to give it a second thought 

515.44 520.50 A: i don't know how people there get on buses any more or any place where there's a crowd of people 

520.25 521.16 B: i know 

520.82 522.49 A: without the thought of 

523.80 529.53 A: [mn] something happening that could take their lives their friends' whatever the case may be 

529.72 530.95 A: it's scary 

531.29 532.35 B: yes 

533.24 534.38 B: i know 

534.84 537.89 B: and it hadn't really dawned on me until i watched 

538.11 543.95 B: that uh news broadcast that you know they're just people they're not that different from us 

540.02 540.80 A: right 

543.06 543.88 A: yeah 

544.03 545.77 A: that see that's true 

546.28 547.51 A: that is true 

547.02 551.69 B: and until you can you know look out your window and see bombs going off 

551.53 552.43 A: right 

552.62 553.49 A: you know 

552.94 560.40 B: it's still a little more you know intellectual for us and yeah 

556.40 559.95 A: (( right it's it's oh now i don't want to say it's a )) 

560.25 565.32 A: it's almost like um i don't say a war game but a um 

566.10 567.93 A: what would you say an intellectual 

568.49 573.89 A: you know three dimensional kind of three d- intellectual three dimensional board game somewhere 

573.44 574.91 B: yeah 

574.20 580.66 A: that you you know you keep tabs on you know you're not playing it but it's out there but you know it's going on 

580.97 584.70 A: and we don't have to play and we're lucky for that you know on that account 

584.93 587.53 A: but again why can't they sit down and say okay 

588.33 591.13 A: let's just you know stop the game 

591.23 595.15 A: you know here you get this we get this done deal move on 

591.53 592.10 B: (( [sigh] )) 

595.84 598.41 A: but you know i guess it'll never happen 

597.96 599.95 B: and i don't know what it would take
