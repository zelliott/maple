0.85 2.50 A: hello 

1.70 3.06 B: hi how are you 

3.57 4.85 A: how's it going 

4.29 6.14 B: good my name is brian 

6.06 7.51 A: (( hi i'm dave )) 

7.04 8.44 B: hi dave how are you doing 

8.11 9.24 A: (( good )) 

8.65 11.61 B: i guess we're talking about foreign relations 

11.14 12.25 A: right 

11.66 15.84 B: and if any other country is a threat to the ah u._s. 

15.55 16.48 A: yep 

16.52 18.23 B: and um 

18.43 20.14 B: what are your thoughts on that 

19.82 25.50 A: (( um [laughter] ah i guess it depends on what you mean by threat you know )) 

25.23 26.60 B: mhm 

26.27 28.30 A: (( right like )) 

28.48 33.60 A: i mean realistically like i don't really think there are any countries that are that big of a threat you know 

33.35 37.37 B: mhm i think the danger also sometimes the [cough] 

37.48 41.01 B: for to to to create news 

41.30 46.71 B: sometimes things get um exaggerated or heightened you know what i'm saying 

46.46 47.42 A: yeah 

46.82 51.90 B: that maybe in in another time people could have just sat down face to face 

51.98 53.54 B: and talked things through 

53.31 54.40 A: mhm 

53.78 57.06 B: but now everything has like becomes a story you know what i'm tying to say 

56.91 58.03 A: right 

57.40 59.89 B: everything becomes hot [laughter] 

59.79 60.91 A: mhm 

60.29 65.96 B: and um th- there's like a danger sometimes in that the press can then contribute sometimes 

66.41 67.68 B: um 

68.14 74.17 B: and sometimes i think we focus so much on tradition or whatever you consider enemy or 

74.14 85.84 B: that we forget about other places you know what i mean for instance all the focus is always on the mideast right well maybe we should be thinking about other parts of the world [laughter] 

80.73 82.36 A: mhm 

85.22 86.33 A: well that's true 

85.88 88.44 B: maybe south america you know 

86.58 91.20 A: (( but )) 

88.49 89.72 B: um 

90.10 93.50 B: and maybe the threat doesn't take traditional forms 

93.17 103.32 A: sure well that's what that's my point it's like in [mn] like like i think that's such a like vague way of trying to think of something like that you know like threat to your country is like a pretty like large statement you know 

102.58 104.15 B: yeah exactly 

103.27 108.93 A: i mean you can have like threats to individual lives you know like in different situations but 

107.25 108.14 B: right 

108.84 112.00 B: yeah the threat could take forms that we're they're not even considering 

108.99 109.99 A: it's like it's 

111.75 112.81 A: right 

112.36 116.06 B: like for like a decline in population and what does that mean 

116.17 117.29 A: right 

116.70 119.04 B: you know [laughter] um 

118.04 122.34 A: i'd have to i'd have to say like we're like we're probably our own biggest threat you know 

121.79 131.88 B: oh i'd say i believe that too you know what i think is a threat too is um the inability to get the truth it seems that despite the technology 

123.59 124.37 A: (( uh-huh )) 

132.35 136.39 B: it's harder and harder to know what's actually real any more [laughter] 

136.13 137.23 A: right 

136.88 138.23 B: um 

138.36 145.83 B: and ah i think what happens um unfortunately a lot of our politicians are have have their own interests 

145.57 146.86 A: mhm 

146.32 146.88 B: (( [cough] )) 

147.09 150.65 B: and those interests are probably not yours or mine [laughter] 

150.00 151.89 A: right 

151.94 155.94 A: no well i mean you know it's so much of it's just political spin you know 

155.41 156.54 B: exactly 

156.72 159.88 B: (( and so it ah )) 

156.76 157.73 A: um 

161.25 170.53 A: no i mean we're being we're being sold the idea of threat all the time like i'm kind of surprised like this is like a topic of conversation you know [laughter] but i guess it's but i guess it's like you know kind of i don't know 

167.10 168.03 B: yeah 

170.65 173.37 A: a general thing maybe people talk about you know 

173.19 176.06 B: mhm well because yeah a lot of times 

174.89 176.91 A: it's in the news i guess 

176.29 182.16 B: well you might talk to your family or your friends but you seldom have the opportunity to talk to somebody like really that you don't know [laughter] 

180.08 181.11 A: mhm 

182.45 188.87 A: right i mean like my girlfriend travels a lot like she spends a lot of time in like south africa and you know 

187.22 188.47 B: mhm 

188.99 195.40 A: we don't really it doesn't come up that much like you know like being threatened by guns in america and abroad i mean it's 

193.84 195.07 B: mhm 

195.85 197.09 A: (( you know )) 

196.96 197.79 B: (( yeah )) 

197.16 197.90 A: (( you know )) 

198.16 200.35 B: i think also that uh 

201.19 207.25 B: i think sometimes ah the way we see the world there's a bit of arrogance on our part 

206.62 207.78 A: mhm 

207.12 218.65 B: that ours is like the only way [laughter] to do things and like no other country n- no one else knows anything [laughter] and we're does that come from you know 

209.69 211.43 A: right 

211.76 212.85 A: yeah 

214.99 216.52 A: yeah 

218.56 219.98 A: right 

219.62 224.97 B: you know just because we have the might doesn't mean that you use it 

224.09 225.64 A: yeah 

225.15 226.23 B: you know 

226.42 227.53 B: um 

228.17 229.64 B: it it's ah 

229.95 235.53 B: you know there's a danger of us becoming super bully [laughter] instead of superpower 

233.33 235.40 A: mhm 

235.50 236.68 A: right 

236.84 237.99 B: um 

238.73 243.53 B: but i think sometimes that we ourselves are the ones to be afraid of 

243.30 246.17 A: sure i totally agree 

243.75 244.40 B: (( [mn] )) 

245.13 256.55 B: as much as the ones that were pointed out to us last year uh iran korea and ah cuba that we also are part of that group [laughter] 

250.12 251.06 A: (( mm )) 

255.37 257.92 A: sure yeah i think we've done a 

258.03 258.60 B: (( [cough] )) 

258.19 262.82 A: done a pretty good job of like creating an environment for threat you know um 

261.45 271.68 B: yeah and everything has become confrontational the the lat- latest episode what was it a few days ago there was that expression you know c- bring it on or come on you know 

268.06 269.15 A: mhm 

271.50 272.62 A: right 

271.74 273.01 B: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

273.07 274.09 A: mhm 

273.16 276.89 B: well what's that all about [laughter] 

274.85 275.81 A: yeah 

276.61 280.07 A: and you're pretty lucky they didn't match you with like a republican you know 

279.67 280.61 B: huh 

280.42 283.37 A: you're kind of lucky they didn't match you with a republican you know 

282.88 285.03 B: yeah right [laughter] 

285.32 286.95 B: yeah i um 

287.55 296.94 B: you know it's it's like we we sort of we're almost like taunt the world sometimes and i i have a friend some friends i talk to on the internet who live overseas 

297.49 301.47 B: and they just can't believe what we the way we portray ourselves 

300.96 310.90 A: [mn] mhm yeah uh it's pretty bad i can't i mean i'd i wish i read more foreign press you know i mean like i listen to the b._b._c. a lot and 

301.78 302.73 B: you know 

303.03 304.14 B: um 

310.13 312.11 B: yeah do you ever see b._b._c. america 

312.05 313.98 A: um sometimes 

312.74 316.78 B: 'cause if you if you see the news on that you really get a different slant 

316.41 317.94 A: yeah 

316.88 321.06 B: than just watching the regular a._b._c. or c._b._s. or n._b._c. news 

320.75 323.75 A: (( yeah )) 

321.60 325.15 B: it makes you see see things just a little differently [laughter] 

324.53 326.62 A: yeah oh definitely 

326.02 334.77 B: you know um but you know i think that ah it's sort of scary times that we're in right now [laughter] 

334.05 336.08 A: yeah definitely 

335.40 341.85 B: you know i just wish that ah we had more leaders and less politicians [laughter] 

340.14 346.38 A: mhm yeah i think it's i think there's something kind of weird like with the idea that you know like 

346.27 356.09 A: you know at the same time that you hear about like like the world okay becoming like a smaller place you know and this sort of thing like the more globalized like every society becomes it's like all of a sudden it's like 

351.50 352.34 B: right 

356.22 361.58 A: you're also being like sold all these ideas about you know threat you know like i think there's something 

361.64 364.79 A: there's like a relationship between those ideas you know 

364.05 366.82 B: uh-huh right yeah i i think that's a good good point 

366.16 376.29 A: i mean it was kind of different when you know it was like war was like i don't know whatever it was like you know terror for lack of a better word it was like this like very foreign concept and now it's like 

368.32 368.88 B: (( [cough] )) 

374.41 380.18 B: yeah it's like when we talk about weapons of mass destruction we don't talk about those that we have 

378.05 378.98 A: mhm 

380.26 381.83 A: right 

380.58 383.84 B: 'cause those are okay [laughter] 

381.87 386.85 A: mhm yeah yeah 

383.98 388.45 B: that somehow gets lost [laughter] 

387.51 390.75 A: oh definitely and that's a threat to us as well you know 

390.38 393.93 B: yeah exactly um 

392.60 393.33 A: (( mm )) 

394.19 395.66 B: so it's ah 

396.46 399.84 B: yeah i think the language affects a lot of this a lot 

399.21 401.05 A: mhm 

400.12 402.41 B: and what does the word threat really mean 

401.95 406.51 A: yeah it's it's a it's a shame you know like we haven't really provided a very like 

402.45 403.28 B: that 

406.57 415.64 A: you know pleasant dialogue you know internationally for you know this sort of thing like this the whole way like we've gone about like addressing i guess the threat you know like is this topic but 

415.73 423.30 A: you know i mean this hasn't been very good it it should be like so much more diplomatic and you know reasonable and 

417.26 418.18 B: (( i know a- )) 

422.66 424.48 B: and it's also like 

423.53 428.16 A: to me to me that would do a lot more to alleviate like the idea of threat than you know 

427.84 432.32 B: you never really get a sense that there's like a new approach to these problems 

432.02 433.66 A: mhm 

432.43 443.58 B: when i see footage from the middle east it's like i've seen these videos since i was about ten years old [laughter] it's the same video in a way you know what i mean yeah all all about revenge rather than okay where can we go with this 

437.32 439.04 A: yeah 

439.30 440.53 A: (( mhm )) 

443.48 447.43 A: right yeah it's not terribly productive 

444.16 445.06 B: you know 

445.23 457.98 B: um no no so we have you know all these people in d._c. and other places with all these resumes that don't connect [laughter] yeah so 

454.05 454.89 A: mhm 

459.53 461.83 B: um where are you located 

460.68 463.40 A: yeah it's a shame um new york 

462.86 464.48 B: oh okay in the city 

463.86 469.29 A: yeah yeah in brooklyn yeah oh nice 

465.02 466.48 B: okay okay

470.46 472.04 A: where are you where are you now 

473.94 477.55 A: okay right mhm 

474.56 477.57 B: yeah i moved from connecticut um 

478.19 481.02 B: got too expensive in connecticut [laughter] 

480.66 484.47 A: oh it's terrible man i'm just here for the summer i to school in boston and it's 

484.63 490.94 A: it's like it's outrageous you know i mean yeah it's like money just like comes out of your pores here 

486.38 488.18 B: uh-huh i can imagine 

490.35 491.92 B: (( oh i know it's i )) 

491.99 494.74 B: have a friend who lives in bay ridge you know that area 

494.10 499.51 A: [mn] yeah yeah yeah i've stayed up there before it's really nice pretty 

496.83 497.63 B: yeah 

497.87 503.53 B: yeah so yeah i grew up in willison park as a kid you know where that is nashua 

502.59 503.52 A: (( uh-uh )) 

504.23 508.91 B: it's right near minneola that area um 

511.29 512.96 B: but 

513.58 515.76 B: yeah threat is ah 

516.09 519.68 B: i i think also this i have a feeling this is what they call the patriot act 

518.93 522.24 A: mhm 

520.06 526.29 B: that also to me is a threat [laughter] because it's threatens the way i live now 

522.25 524.78 A: yeah [laughter] that's true 

525.84 527.75 A: mhm 

526.90 534.59 B: and there's a perception that every [mn] if everything gets blurred through patriotism that's a danger 

534.53 535.81 A: yeah 

534.87 540.62 B: then we d- then we're no longer in a democracy ourself that's a threat as well [laughter] 

539.20 547.31 A: yeah and it's you know it's like the idea of like you know what patriotism is like was never like very clearly defined i mean it's just sort of like vague you know 

546.89 549.02 B: yeah yeah 

547.52 550.55 A: kind of like mystic mystical sort of you 

549.58 553.54 B: yeah i i was raised catholic and i don't know if you know anything about the catholic church 

553.20 554.92 A: know a little bit yeah 

553.82 566.11 B: but one of the big things they would tell me when i was a kid [mn] it's one of the mysteries what does that mean [laughter] i could have said that it's one of the mysteries [laughter] 'cause they don't have a better answer 

558.55 559.11 A: (( [mn] )) 

560.48 561.61 A: (( oh yeah )) 

562.72 565.15 A: right [laughter] 

566.00 567.52 A: (( yeah )) 

566.75 570.00 B: you know so there's this blurring of stuff you know 

569.29 570.48 A: mhm 

570.59 577.72 B: you know there's ah but the i think the threat is as much of an internal thing as an external thing 

576.87 577.82 A: sure 

577.74 587.43 B: and i think that our politicians can fan the concept of threat and take it from something that wasn't really an issue to being a full fledged issue 

581.29 582.67 A: mhm 

587.15 590.66 A: right yeah it's it's you know it's a marketing tool i mean 

587.64 588.96 B: [laughter] 

589.99 596.52 B: yeah yeah it's like what ever happened to true diplomacy [laughter] [laughter] 

594.51 595.90 A: (( yeah )) 

596.33 599.89 A: you know what i mean we don't we don't it's unfortunate that we don't have politicians that are really
