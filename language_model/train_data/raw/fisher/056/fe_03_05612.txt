5.04 6.54 A: not bad how are you 

6.58 8.61 B: i'm all right i'm all right 

9.20 21.18 A: well what's fascinating is i know literally nothing about strikes by professional athletes all i remember was the baseball strike a couple of years ago 

21.12 26.21 A: and i really haven't paid attention to just about anything after that 

25.54 33.44 B: well i don't think there's been a major a major sports strike i think that the the trade unions for those 

33.45 44.43 B: for major athletes is they're doing okay i think there hasn't been talk of strike but i'm i'm well see i'm with you i don't know i mean i i think it's ridiculous that they go on strike 

44.58 47.94 B: they're making the minimum of like a million dollars a person 

48.71 53.24 A: [lipsmack] right and and and they go on strike on top of that for 

53.91 55.95 A: ridiculous reasons 

55.60 57.63 B: ye- yeah yeah um 

56.62 57.69 A: um 

59.21 66.14 A: well i it's it's i don't know it doesn't seem to make too much sense i pretty much stopped following baseball after 

66.28 67.61 A: the uh 

67.77 69.95 A: the strike when was it ninety 

69.39 70.82 B: [mn] ninety four 

70.32 71.73 A: four i think 

71.79 74.34 A: so that's like ten years almost 

73.74 75.06 B: yeah 

74.49 75.60 A: um 

75.96 79.88 A: just because it was just so outlandishly ridiculous 

79.85 81.10 B: mhm 

80.53 81.69 A: um 

81.43 85.08 B: and it's and it's a shame because you know we we put 

85.91 92.78 B: our our athletes our musicians that's you know america's version of of royalty 

92.81 95.60 B: and we put these people on pedestals and 

95.79 96.79 B: it uh 

97.50 103.91 B: they make so much money 'cause they generate so much money because the american public is stupid 

104.33 112.74 B: and it's frustrating when they go on strike 'cause it just emphasizes how ridiculous our country can be sometimes 

112.68 113.43 A: (( mm mm )) 

113.78 115.57 B: you know this is where it's 

116.88 121.19 A: [noise] well yeah it's interesting the the comparison between 

117.21 117.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

121.11 133.88 A: musicians let's say and sports figures they are when you boil it down they are both in the entertainment field that's what sports essentially is it's entertainment it's showbiz in a way 

127.46 128.66 B: mhm 

133.78 135.75 B: yeah it it absolutely is 

135.69 140.79 A: and uh a lot of people don't look at it that way it is nothing but showbiz 

140.93 148.09 A: um there is you know no one is doubting that there is a skill behind it it's it's a fantastic skill 

148.17 157.54 A: to be able to you know hit a ball with that stick i can't do it i i certainly can't do it thirty percent of the time as a lot these guys do 

158.05 159.12 A: um 

159.49 163.09 B: yeah well if you hit it thirty percent of the time you're gonna be put in the hall of fame 

163.11 172.48 A: exactly exactly do yeah a- an- and that's interesting too find another job where you can be successful thirty percent of the time 

169.18 171.48 B: where where you can 

172.16 174.04 B: where exactly where you can fail 

172.77 174.49 A: and and be a king 

174.52 182.56 B: where you can fail seventy percent of the time let alone be you know like if you look instead of being successful thirty you're failing seventy percent if i 

181.42 182.63 A: i mean if y- if 

182.57 184.25 B: (( if i failed seventy percent )) 

182.65 185.81 A: you were a weatherman they'd throw you out 

185.38 193.01 B: yeah [laughter] if i failed seventy seventy percent of of the stuff that i would do i would get kicked out of my job 

192.79 194.12 A: exactly 

193.53 196.47 B: that that wouldn't be able to happen but we we 

195.63 197.83 A: exactly so 

196.86 197.96 B: you know it's 

198.85 204.08 B: i can understand you know just taking the other side of them going on strike for 

204.16 205.06 B: um 

205.33 212.54 B: and to you know there there's there's a reason why they have these anti trusts like a sport has an anti trust law 

212.78 218.47 B: and that that's that's how absurd it it it got where 

212.89 213.84 A: uh-huh 

218.66 226.55 B: baseball was you know we were able in you know it was able to to get the minds off of of world war one and world war two 

226.67 231.56 B: and it it just between free agency and 

231.81 235.80 B: television rights is that we turned it into 

236.02 238.32 B: a a completely different monster 

238.75 239.71 A: true 

239.98 247.53 A: um i was [lipsmack] for a long time did did you know or remember who jim belton is 

246.81 249.63 B: jim belton yeah that that name sounds very familiar 

249.19 252.04 A: he was a a baseball player he was a pitcher 

252.27 257.22 A: and he wrote the first tell all book about what really goes on 

256.79 258.07 B: okay yes 

257.86 262.33 A: it was ball four and they put they essentially they threw him out of baseball 

262.63 266.90 A: 'cause he talked about how they fool around with girls on the road and stuff like that 

267.19 268.08 B: (( yeah )) 

268.16 275.90 A: he i was i was going out with his niece for awhile so uh i got know you know the whole family and stuff like that he 

276.12 284.42 A: thirty years ago he was fighting fighting for a raise to make thirty thousand dollars 

284.61 291.59 A: now thirty thousand dollars thirty years ago was a good salary but it wasn't you're not going to become a millionaire on that 

290.99 292.80 B: mhm 

292.04 293.66 A: you know that was 

293.89 297.31 A: you know upper middle let's say 

297.56 298.38 B: (( yep uh-uh okay )) 

298.00 309.59 A: and and and you know and he had to really fight for that now these guys i mean there's no way you could describe a professional baseball player 

309.79 316.13 A: as be- you know being in the upper middle portion of of of of our income brackets 

313.30 314.73 B: no they're they're 

315.76 320.07 B: m- minimum minimum wage is four hundred and fifty thousand or something like that [mn] 

319.08 322.09 A: and there's no way that's upper middle so 

321.51 322.29 B: (( no )) 

322.10 333.64 A: so you know and and he definitely wasn't getting minimum back then minimum back then was twelve thousand so you know it that's the equivalent of him earning a million dollars today 

328.03 328.96 B: yep 

333.98 343.47 A: and and it's just you know it it it wasn't the same back then and and he was so upset you know he always used to say that he was born too early 

343.49 351.92 A: you know 'cause if he was just born twenty years later he would have been making millions of dollars as well doing the same exact thing and you gotta wonder 

352.34 353.31 A: you know 

353.46 356.86 A: a you know a guy who made cars 

357.02 359.11 A: in the early seventies 

359.58 368.29 A: is pretty much you know if you count for inflation and the cost of living and stuff like that they're pretty much making the same money these days 

368.18 369.97 B: oh yeah yeah 

369.42 377.83 A: you know people who did such and such back then are pretty much making the same amount of mon- or or the same purchasing power these days 

377.63 378.37 B: right 

377.84 380.69 A: except for athletes 

380.82 390.38 A: who have gone from you know let's say being a little bit above average back then to being incredibly above average nowadays 

389.31 402.12 B: and and now when you take if you if you wanna even take the argument further where let's say in the ninety sixties and seventies the real on- the only sport that really was generating money is baseball 

401.86 403.21 A: right 

402.71 403.69 B: now 

404.02 409.05 B: basketball football hockey these are multi billion dollar a year 

409.09 420.92 B: companies where you where you have a person like george steinbrenner where he is majority shareholder of the new york yankees but he also has ownership in the new jersey devils and the new jersey mets 

409.90 411.35 A: (( exactly mhm )) 

420.68 422.28 A: i didn't know that 

421.70 426.38 B: yeah that's part of the uh that's part of the the the yes system 

425.85 426.96 A: (( ahah )) 

426.89 435.07 B: and th- this year alone between the met making the finals and the devils winning the cut i mean he's 

435.77 443.23 B: the he he makes more money from these people and the the the money that is generated between 

443.31 454.35 B: tee shirts and sneakers and television rights and n- what what gives these athletes the and the the unions the the the the players association they're 

454.62 458.15 B: they're they really are looking at it that at like 

458.18 470.73 B: the bottom portion of the guys are getting screwed in the league but they're not they're still making two hundred thousand dollars there is no one in any professional sport that's making sixty five thousand dollars here 

470.76 473.20 A: jeeze that i did not know 

472.94 483.03 B: yeah they're they're it's it's they're all on a hundred and fifty thousand then they're they're making money through endorsement deals through contracts like this kid lebron james 

483.15 488.77 B: ninety million dollars for a shoe contract before he even touches a basketball in the n._b._a. 

488.56 490.58 A: mhm 

489.70 494.24 B: and i gotta think to myself i think well 

495.54 499.67 B: where is this money coming like it's this kid getting ninety million dollars 

500.72 502.84 B: i- it would be great to give 

503.14 505.41 B: ninety teachers a million dollars 

506.30 509.25 A: nine- nine- ninety school systems even yeah 

508.12 514.13 B: ninety school systems a million dollars whatever you want to break it down to where you know just just it's 

514.55 520.82 B: absurd it's completely absurd it's gotten out of and and it's only going to get worse 

515.81 516.75 A: yes 

521.05 524.69 A: well a lot of that comes from the fact 

521.25 522.00 B: it 

524.76 527.01 A: that 

527.24 528.19 A: (( uh uh )) 

528.57 533.68 A: people seem to it seems to be this human need to 

534.21 542.69 A: root for some sort of a group we're number one we're number one people have that just about all over the world 

542.96 546.46 A: and uh since i don't know am- america's 

544.25 546.18 B: (( in a capital in a )) 

546.35 556.89 B: in a capital intensive society when you root for number one number one's gonna make a ton of money and and these days number two is making a ton of money number three number four number five 

551.02 552.02 A: right 

556.84 571.00 B: everyone's getting a piece of of the pie and that's where the the you know that's the unions the unions are making sure that everyone is getting paid really well in the system today could you imagine if if like the the teachers union 

571.31 579.44 B: tried to to to say well you know what we're not gonna teach anymore unless everyone gets raises of five hundred thousand dollars 

579.31 580.07 A: (( mm )) 

579.92 583.01 B: that it would it would be impossible 

583.16 584.97 A: exactly 

583.21 584.22 B: it would mean 

584.29 598.39 B: it would never be able to work because of the way the the american people place the entertainers on a pedestal and and it's not just baseball it's you have you know there's the actors' guild the directors' guild and all the other 

598.26 599.89 B: you know entertainment which we
