50.61 54.81 A: yes um there'll never be peace in the middle east 

51.40 52.88 B: interesting change 

55.10 60.95 B: yeah i mean it it dep- it certainly in terms of if you were a betting person it's it's ah improbable ah 

59.94 63.55 A: yeah okay impro- yeah i was going to say never i mean you know if we 

61.33 62.19 B: yeah 

62.50 66.97 B: yeah yeah yeah no i know what you're saying it's just sort of figure of speech but ah 

66.01 72.07 A: it's just so inbred or i don't say inbred that's the wrong term but so 

72.20 74.24 A: you know um 

74.36 79.68 A: entrenched in in the beliefs and the philosophies and all it's it's scary 

78.56 86.35 B: yeah i mean as if it's f- for starter i mean there's first of all the like the the notion of an idea of a middle east is fiction i mean there is no 

86.32 98.69 B: middle east i mean there's lots of different reasons it's like you have this you have a secular palestinian movement you know which is also relying on you know dec- [mn] the islamic fundamentalists come in and and c- capitalize on this declaration of a 

86.51 87.26 A: (( oh )) 

87.41 88.45 A: right 

98.59 112.71 B: thirty some odd year occupation you know so there you've got that and then you've got this al qaeda terrorist stuff but that permeates all you know that's in indonesia as well you know th- that's plenty so it's like so like the whole idea of the islamic fundamentalist stuff 

100.54 101.66 A: correct 

106.74 109.42 A: right well as long as that's right 

112.64 118.30 B: certainly isn't limited to the middle east and then in the middle east y- you know then you have the levant and you've got the 

118.43 125.26 B: you know you've got iran i mean it's just like so different and like iraq is so different from iran you know yeah 

123.80 132.59 A: well that's right you know and that's part of the deal too i mean they had their ten year war they could never really be at peace with each other although it's the old you know um 

132.67 138.54 A: the friends of my enemy theory that you know as long as you hate right [mn] as long as you hate ah 

134.34 136.69 B: yeah yeah the enemy of my enemy is my friend [mn] 

138.66 141.98 A: you know the u._s. in this case or some other 

142.10 144.71 A: you know democratic ah being 

143.06 152.92 B: yeah well i mean the thing is the thing is is like you know the whole idea of a superpower is that you have power over regions and the united states basically 

152.89 162.19 B: ah after world war two has always needed or well wanted basically what they call the most probably you know the state department called the most dependent material prize 

162.18 173.43 B: in world history ah and those were the energy reserves under the arabian arabian peninsula and it still is th- the dominance it's sixty percent of the word's energy it's not so much the united states which gets a lot of its energy from 

166.96 167.78 A: right 

173.65 185.60 B: venezuela and brazil and or whatever colombia something like that ah la- latin america places that are closer to yeah i mean it's it's closer to ship ship the oil from there and so it's like 

177.75 178.61 A: right 

179.16 180.26 A: latin america ah 

186.21 200.16 B: c- controlling the region has always been the primary goal in order to have power like for instance we still have veto power over japan over oil so if japan ever pursued a policy that we really didn't like we we we we can virtually cut off in 

200.23 203.25 B: existing treaties today we can cut off their oil supply 

203.15 204.95 A: see i didn't know that 

204.37 206.10 B: yeah it's fascinating like 

205.00 207.40 A: that's interesting that's interesting 

206.21 208.74 B: yeah yeah and so like 

207.82 210.14 A: and that's from world war two i assume 

209.40 219.48 B: yeah this is all after world war two i mean basically the the british and the french ran the middle eastern system until and then were and then they were demolished in world war two everybody was demolished 

214.43 216.04 A: right oh no question 

219.35 224.96 B: and so basically the united states i mean the british sort of well ruefully you know a british you know ah 

225.19 230.45 B: permanent official i don't know what department but you know after world war two s- basically ruefully 

230.58 231.74 B: declared 

231.90 236.58 B: ah in some document that you know the united states is basically going to inherit the system 

236.38 248.48 B: ah but at least we'll be junior partner that was his metaphor it'll be th- the first and you know sort of second in command ah br- the british would be the french were just booted out entirely ah they lost lost all their colonies 

242.78 243.66 A: right 

246.17 247.12 A: right 

248.36 254.80 B: ah and then what the united states did is used what sort of a neocolonial system of basically it's sort of like 

255.16 269.71 B: you know you have some jobs where like you have a management and it but it's like completely like authoritarian and they like tell you everything what to do and they're like really hands on but you have other management positions which are kind of like look you're just sort of responsible i'm not going to oversee what you do 

269.66 271.27 B: (( not going to be hands on )) 

271.14 273.32 B: you're going to do your thing right e- 

271.16 273.29 A: micro versus m- macro 

273.13 287.73 B: exactly and so they there there's the hands on approach and the hands off approach and the united states has always used the hands- and it's you know it's smarter basically local local net- what they call them in again like the state department language was local gendarmes ah which are protectorates or 

286.53 287.43 A: okay 

287.53 290.51 B: or police ah and they sort of run 

287.86 288.55 A: right 

291.08 296.47 B: you they run their own affairs ah and the only time there's a problem is if they just get out of line 

296.33 300.31 A: yes that's right get out of our line the line the line we've drawn 

296.99 297.83 B: ah 

298.09 300.05 B: right yeah yeah exactly right 

300.09 312.44 B: right exactly i mean there are there are there are acceptable limits it's not like we're going to come in and make every single decision you know that would be silly it would be uh it's it's a waste of time and a waste of money uh according to policy planning so 

305.29 307.57 A: right well once that 

313.26 321.11 B: you know but it's it's it's you know back i guess we're kind of arguing the whole system but i mean in terms of the middle east th- the big problem is that 

321.44 331.95 B: you know you have you have you know al qaeda and stuff like that and their propaganda ah is very effective because it hits home with a lot of people ah who definitely you know understand things 

329.00 329.82 A: right 

331.85 343.81 B: that people here have no idea about you know people here have no idea about all the things that go on i mean 'cause you have to you have to admit look th- the media that people read and see here is just as much propaganda 

343.76 347.69 B: as what people get in other parts of the world you know everywhere 

345.91 355.11 A: sure it depends what paper you're reading you know i read the new york times versus the new york post i mean i'll read them both but if you know y- you read you read one versus the other and you go 

347.81 349.41 B: yeah exactly [mn] 

351.15 353.29 B: [laughter] right right 

354.67 355.46 B: sure 

355.40 364.18 A: what is really happening there you really can't get a grasp of what's happening there because we don't understand that just the simple day to day life that they go through 

356.98 358.15 B: (( yeah exactly )) 

363.86 365.57 B: right exactly and even 

364.30 366.21 A: we don't understand that 

365.67 369.57 B: yeah and even the jump between like the new york times and say like al jazeera 

369.47 370.67 A: right okay 

369.47 380.78 B: you know people here people here can like like i mean people here could barely consider al jazeera a legitimate news source but it is i mean they are pretty objective i mean they basically are just simply reporting things 

380.64 388.33 B: that american media doesn't right exactly i mean that's a fact most people most propaganda isn't lies i mean propaganda is simply 

381.88 382.95 A: that happen 

388.34 396.07 B: ah you're basically i mean you're doing the job of a journalist is to shape a story and explain it i mean the world is full of full of information if i like 

393.52 394.30 A: right 

396.13 403.84 B: if i would say i was in charge of you know explaining sports you know if i'm in charge of explaining what happened any given sunday on any n._f._l. 

403.34 404.22 A: right 

403.69 413.38 B: i i wouldn't be bringing the weather into it i wouldn't be saying like in the middle of a sentence just go and the barometric measure was this i mean it wouldn't make sense i could it would be a fact i could give you all of the facts 

410.58 411.43 A: right 

412.59 414.14 A: ri- it would be a fact 

413.24 422.70 B: about barometr- right it would be a fact and it would be true it just wouldn't be relevant to the picture you're trying to convey and so and that's and that's [mn] you know and that's why 

416.90 417.69 A: right 

418.79 419.77 A: correct 

423.10 424.78 B: a doctrinal system 

424.79 435.19 B: ah and so the you know the american system of you know of conveying information is still a system you know what i mean for whatever it is and for all it has as dynamic as it is 

432.01 432.75 A: right 

435.23 449.84 B: ah it's still a system that basically conveys a certain picture and has acceptable boundaries and unacceptable boundaries i mean you you can find definite times like the gary webb thing with the c._i._a. and that's another matter but but i know that's like off 

441.72 442.57 A: right 

446.55 447.82 A: [laughter] 

448.24 451.00 A: right that's another phone call for us 

450.66 452.82 B: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so )) 

451.65 452.76 A: [laughter] 

453.18 458.85 B: so [laughter] so yeah but in terms of like the road map and all that stuff i mean the road map is 

459.20 466.46 B: they picked it up i mean they basically picked up where oslo left off and if you ever look at a map of oslo i mean 

466.41 474.34 B: it was a complete raw deal i mean they the palestinians have no leverage they have nothing to negotiate from they they don't have 

473.16 485.64 A: well that's right all the only negotiating thing the only thing they can give up is is the terror or the bombing or whatever you want to call it that's all they have they have no um land to give up they have no power they have no you know 

478.68 483.04 B: right exactly exactly right right 

484.05 495.72 B: right r- right i mean the land the land the land that they have to give up is like the land that [mn] they're under occupation now so it's like well they don't ex- they really can't 

485.76 487.18 A: a- and that's 

493.00 494.01 A: right 

495.73 497.10 B: (( exactly )) 

495.96 499.85 A: they can't give it up they can't gi- that's what i say there's nothing to give up 

497.32 501.83 B: right exactly [mn] it's already been it's already been right it's already been given up exactly exactly 

501.05 501.94 A: right 

501.85 503.38 B: and so it's just like 

502.04 505.85 A: so that's what i say if you talk about negotiations how are they going to negotiate 

504.47 516.84 B: right right exactly and so they you know and so the united states historically always kind of played both i mean like the p._l._o. it it does get money from the united states you know an- and so it [mn] 

514.16 516.97 A: there's no question about it and it always has 

516.88 524.81 B: right it always has but it sort of and but but the [mn] but the p._l._o. has also been under arafat it's been this incredibly it's like been the one of the most 

524.68 528.83 B: corrupt third world movements i've you know i've ever seen i mean it's just like they 

527.69 528.71 A: right 

528.61 540.54 B: they did silly shit like in- investing you know a billion dollar loan to like hungary in the eighties i mean it's just preposterous it's authoritarian it's it's everything wrong with a third world movement it's like what what the palestinians needed 

540.33 543.71 B: was basically gandhi and what they've got is you know 

543.31 544.62 A: is arafat 

543.95 547.04 B: (( is stalin yeah exa- i mean you know )) 

544.87 545.49 A: (( yeah )) 

545.54 549.13 A: right how how much is in his bank account somewhere right you know 

548.08 557.05 B: well yeah yeah yeah the whole thing i mean and even his like little local cops his local thugs i mean the palestinian authority basically simply 

552.32 553.12 A: right 

556.96 568.00 B: i- is going to act as a loc- it's like the same thing with the local gendarmes i mean that's the idea it's like he's going to he's going to be in there and he's going to basically maintain order with his thugs all right so what's the difference to most palestinians between 

561.52 562.32 A: right 

567.93 576.82 B: being beat up by palestinian thugs or being shot by you know israeli thugs so you know in their eyes it's just like well this is pretty shitty 

572.73 574.09 A: (( israeli thugs right )) 

576.70 583.71 B: you know [laughter] and they tried they tried yeah i mean they tried to actually get rid of of arafat and ah 

576.74 577.88 A: (( think of the )) 

577.97 579.02 A: choice 

584.05 592.36 B: [mn] this is very interesting this is covered in the israeli media i mean very clearly 'cause they have a clear picture they have to i mean it's it's their situation so in ha'arets they 

589.04 589.92 A: right 

592.45 599.95 B: you know they were discussing that in the mid nineties [mn] arafat was actually dragged to the table to actually sign os- the oslo peace accords which were very dam-
