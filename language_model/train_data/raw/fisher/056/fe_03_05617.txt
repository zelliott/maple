328.12 328.74 B: (( [cough] )) 

329.39 332.71 B: and um to get back to the subject um 

333.75 338.25 B: i thought that was very interesting when um 

336.66 337.84 A: mhm 

338.68 340.07 B: when the yankees 

340.37 341.30 B: (( ah ))

392.69 395.54 A: (( yeah mhm yeah )) 

393.03 396.40 B: but if they would spend the money they would win too 

398.50 401.93 A: that's true they were spending the money on good players 

401.99 403.79 B: (( yeah )) 

402.35 405.29 A: and then they were getting good
