11.90 14.66 A: (( okay [laughter] go ahead )) 

13.64 15.58 B: right so september eleventh

17.54 19.04 B: harris yeah mark 

18.70 23.64 A: yeah yeah um well do you wanna go first 

19.72 22.17 B: yeah [mn] um 

23.69 30.86 B: i'll go first well i living in l._a. at the time and i'm from new york i'm a native new yorker 

24.51 25.46 A: okay 

30.63 31.51 A: okay 

30.87 32.22 B: and um 

32.39 40.22 B: since then i've moved back here is probably the biggest thing i don't think it was because of september eleventh but um 

40.36 47.09 B: i did feel like i really wanted to be back in new york when september eleventh happened 

45.62 59.12 A: well being a native new yorker i can u- understand that i mean in your case no i'm i'm actually talking to you from los angeles and still am in los angeles i was here when when the events happened um friends from new york 

49.29 50.46 B: yeah are you 

51.27 52.11 B: oh 

56.71 67.04 B: it was so funny i was i was over in a friend's house in glendale and she woke me up and she said it was like six a._m. she was like come look at this and she turned on the t._v. and i was like what 

67.95 72.69 A: i was uh i was in the same way in th- i was in the valley when it happened same situation 

68.40 69.34 B: crazy 

73.09 74.03 B: huh 

74.81 78.75 B: well so what changes have you made 

78.88 79.94 A: um 

80.17 87.96 A: the ch- primary i you know not necessarily in the way i deal with other people but [mn] one way in which it's 

87.88 99.94 A: directly affected me is the fact that my job takes place out of state i travel to nevada for work three days a week uh i teach out there so i commute via airplane [noise] 

97.68 98.44 B: (( oh )) 

100.18 113.78 A: and that's made a very interesting situation just in regards i used to be able just jump on a plane with fifteen minutes before my flight would leave and i would basically have certainty that i would reach my destination 

100.72 101.48 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

113.65 117.88 A: and i would make it through airport security and make it on time et cetera et cetera 

118.00 124.78 A: nowadays you know not even i have to i have to get there much earlier obviously um 

124.00 124.59 B: (( mm )) 

125.21 128.00 A: and um i don't uh 

128.09 129.19 A: you know i 

129.42 136.39 A: and i can't even take things i i used to have a a uh swiss army knife i'd just take with me on my key chain i can't take it with me 

136.44 137.80 A: anymore 

136.74 138.28 B: right 

138.17 148.16 A: um and in terms of how i relate to other people i really don't look at anybody differently i i kind of thought that um 

148.52 162.31 A: you know something like this was going to happen one day in this country i didn't know of what scope it was it was horrible that anybody you know that any lives were lost um but just the mere fact that they tried 

155.93 157.65 B: right 

162.36 168.23 A: you know to blow up say the trade center at one time means it sooner or later something unfortunately was gonna happen 

168.34 173.55 A: um i was one of the one of those people when oklahoma city happened the first thing i thought 

168.81 169.70 B: right 

173.45 185.48 A: not necessarily that it was say uh terrorists you know al qaeda but that it was probably that that was my first initial thought because i thought we would be in that chain of events sooner or later 

185.65 186.54 B: right 

185.91 194.08 A: um [lipsmack] so how it's affected me is the fact that i you know at least when i look at other people um 

194.60 200.93 A: say of middle eastern descent uh i don't look at them any differently but i notice how many 

201.11 203.76 A: other people i feel look at them different 

204.19 219.14 A: [laughter] um at my town the strange but like if you get on a plane and so- there's a gentleman wearing a turban you notice everybody staring at him and he could be the most innocent guy in the world and i you know i feel like he's being treated differently 

204.47 206.32 B: right 

212.35 213.44 B: right 

213.47 214.04 B: (( [mn] )) 

219.20 225.62 A: so i i don't know i go about my business the same worse impact on me is in terms of air travel [laughter] 

219.34 221.02 B: right 

226.14 234.40 B: right well it's funny because like there's there's a guy at my work who's um [noise] of some sort of like indian 

226.97 228.59 A: um and you know 

234.29 245.10 B: asian descent and like he wears a turban and has like a long beard and everything and there's definitely like a vibe about him i'm temping and so i'm just there for a week but there's a there's some sort of 

235.47 236.33 A: mhm 

245.29 252.54 B: vibe about him like he has to be like a nice guy or something you know what i mean like like it must be strange to be 

249.76 250.79 A: mhm 

252.61 262.46 B: of like asian descent you know in that people look at you like that you know and that you have to sort of like make sure that you're p._r. is in 

258.03 259.21 A: absolutely 

262.51 270.95 A: yeah you you you can't be a regular regular jerk the way the rest of us are because otherwise people think oh my god you're gonna blow something up 

262.52 263.37 B: (( you know )) 

266.95 268.90 B: right 

270.56 273.59 B: right yeah you can't like yell or scream or anything [laughter] 

272.87 277.48 A: [laughter] yeah no it and and that's very that's very unfortunate it 

277.54 286.92 A: um well well being in new york i mean is the climates there when how many years were you how long were you gone from new york before you moved back 

286.30 289.81 B: yeah i was in l._a. for three years 

289.58 292.94 A: three years so how's the climate in new york now 

293.40 297.93 B: it's now um i'd say it's back to normal 

298.36 306.83 B: definitely back to normal i mean the only thing that like really sucks is that new york is in a huge deficit and so there's all these 

306.69 312.25 B: like taxes and craziness going on in terms of like jobs and um 

312.08 321.83 B: like tax hikes everywhere and like pretty much that shit and so that's sort of put straits on everyone here 

321.48 327.25 A: uh do you live on the wh- what part of new york do you live in i'm fair- fairly familiar with it 

326.79 328.71 B: i live in brooklyn 

327.77 330.38 A: okay my dad was from jackson heights that's 

330.39 332.07 A: that's why i asked yeah 

330.53 337.60 B: oh cool yeah i'm near there in queens originally but um [lipsmack] 

333.82 334.75 A: okay 

335.58 336.51 A: okay 

337.39 350.05 B: yeah it seems to be pretty much back to normal i mean like it's not really talked about very much it's not avoided either but it's just not really talked about it's sort of like 

349.93 361.07 B: like if anyone were to use it as a plot point for anything it'd be trite at this point sort of the vibe of it is like no let's stop talking about it already because 

354.89 356.07 A: oh yeah 

361.38 367.42 B: it's just boring by now you know like move on that's sort of the vibe here 

363.86 364.77 A: yeah 

365.34 370.36 A: scary that you it's scary that you use the word plot point uh what what line of work are you in 

370.70 372.31 B: i'm an actor 

371.68 380.29 A: you're an actor okay no i i just when you said that i figured you were probably in the arts i'm also in the arts so [laughter] just leave it at that [laughter] 

372.93 374.65 B: (( yeah )) 

377.43 378.23 B: (( uh )) 

379.87 382.54 B: (( yeah oh )) 

380.71 383.89 A: um but that makes sense the uh the new york like connection 

384.23 385.32 A: um 

384.25 385.98 B: yeah 

385.57 395.04 A: i yeah you know i one thing i've noticed and i don't know if this is uh have you seen this have you seen terminator three yet by any chance 

394.16 397.02 B: no i haven't 

395.09 399.98 A: is this a mov- do you care if i talk about it at all i don't wanna give anything away 

398.60 401.30 B: yeah talk about it go ahead go ahead 

400.67 408.57 A: um well if you've seen terminator two the whole point of terminator two is that the future is open and you can change your negative future 

408.73 410.98 A: if you see terminator three 

408.78 410.59 B: right 

411.20 423.24 A: no doomsday is evitable and it's about finding you know the good way through that uh finding the positivity and you know and making your way through unfortunately nasty stuff that's gonna happen to you 

414.20 414.80 B: (( mm )) 

423.46 430.26 A: i don't think we made that kind of movie say before september eleventh i think post september eleventh we can make that movie 

423.94 426.00 B: (( right )) 

430.42 432.20 B: right 

431.04 433.20 A: so i think it's changed 

433.63 445.25 A: uh you know so- some of the things that we as americans just in terms of our art how we'll look things we can be a little more fatal- fatalistic and and um and it's a part of our lives more 

445.51 450.35 B: huh see the theater in new york has gone in the opposite direction 

446.47 447.30 A: (( so but )) 

450.39 452.77 B: like it's pretty much um [lipsmack] 

452.80 459.00 B: like the big hit is hairspray it's like things that are bubbly and fun are the hits right now 

457.38 458.36 A: mhm 

458.82 466.52 B: so anything dark like like man of la mancha's playing on broadway which is a really really dark musical and it's supposed to be 

466.46 472.73 B: absolutely brilliant and you never hear about it no you never hear about it 

468.43 471.13 A: and it's not doing that well huh 

472.73 481.92 B: nothing i didn't get really nominated for tony's and it's supposed to be amazing like everyone who has seen it has been like it's unbelievable but no one goes to see it 

481.06 486.57 A: who who did the book uh a- and music to that man of la mancha 

485.54 488.98 B: (( [lipsmack] i'm not sure it's man of la mancha was written )) 

489.38 492.97 B: years and years ago this is like a revival 

490.60 499.74 A: oh oh my god i'm i'm thinking like it's a reinvention no it's the old impossible dream that's right i yeah okay i'm sorry [laughter] 

495.34 497.01 B: ye- yeah yeah that one 

497.28 500.40 B: yeah so no it's okay 

500.51 505.61 B: [cough] but i mean that's just an example of like where art has gone in new york 

505.17 505.99 A: huh 

505.97 510.47 B: um yeah the best musical and best play this year are both 

510.43 524.01 B: very sort of fun things i mean the play was a little more risky but still very like the tone of the play is very sort of bubbly and and light spirited 

523.68 538.07 A: how how did i remember there was um like like anthon lee anthony lapalia was in some you know uh he was in a a september eleventh piece about his fire company or his [mn] 

536.97 541.44 B: oh yeah yeah yeah and i think they made a movie of it him and sigourney weaver 

539.62 540.69 A: yeah 

540.77 548.40 A: that's that's right how did did that seem to have any impact or that was kind of a momentary just handling of the situation and then 

548.52 552.80 A: you know it it's faded from the scene is that is that [noise] 

551.48 558.14 B: i didn't really hear about it very much except for i read about it in the times a few times but i didn't see it 

558.21 570.01 B: um people um from what the times said like were really enjoying it and it was really great but there were also celebrities in it so i don't think it made any sort of impact on anything 

570.26 580.38 B: i don't i think i don't know how much impact theater really has anymore i mean this is a whole another topic but like movies are so 

578.04 579.90 A: [noise] well tha- that is a whole 

580.61 591.50 B: you know big and everyone sees them i think that they're a lot more influential because a play everyone would have to go and see it and not everyone in new york went to see that you know 

591.24 592.74 A: no absolutely 

592.73 593.71 B: so 

593.03 595.01 A: yeah absolutely 

595.22 596.28 B: yeah 

596.02 597.00 A: um 

597.46 599.89 A: wh- i will say this just getting back to this
