153.96 155.81 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

155.02 158.60 B: we were trying to get news of of people back home and it was 

161.14 164.13 B: um like it was uh a difficult time 

163.27 164.97 A: [noise] oh of course 

164.65 167.59 B: yeah but like i don't know 

167.92 169.57 B: if i've really changed 

170.70 172.42 B: my lifestyle much 

172.36 173.35 A: mhm 

172.85 175.47 B: (( other than that um )) 

176.86 182.18 B: like i kinda think that you know when your time comes your time comes 

181.84 183.32 A: i see uh-huh 

182.94 184.78 B: and 

185.11 189.67 B: there's something there's not a lot you can do about it um 

187.85 189.87 A: right 

193.31 198.49 A: yeah the only thing i would say too is that i actually feel safer to fly now than i did before 

198.62 202.96 A: just 'cause 'cause there's so much crap now [laughter] 

201.46 204.30 B: (( mm well you feel safer flying because of yeah yeah )) 

203.56 204.97 A: yeah i do 

205.16 208.39 A: i mean i never felt unsafe flying but i just feel like 

208.59 216.30 A: like now it's like such such a hot issue that i mean for at least for a while it's gonna be you know a very safe place to be 

215.71 217.71 B: yeah yeah 

217.87 219.06 A: so 

218.92 222.41 B: yeah i think that's good but um 

219.09 220.12 A: (( i mean that's )) 

223.56 232.06 B: like i've never had really a fear of flying the thing is like your chances of getting knocked down by a bus are so much greater or being in a car accident 

226.35 227.70 A: mhm 

231.55 232.69 A: right 

232.32 241.54 B: so much greater and and my family was gonna come out to visit me um this summer 'cause i'm originally from scotland and they were gonna come out and visit 

239.83 241.61 A: mhm 

241.49 253.20 B: um but they wouldn't come because they were scared of of flying and like i tried to say to them but you know you drive your car every day and your more likely to have uh an accident in your car than 

253.21 260.08 B: that it is to be in a plane that'll crash they're like no no no no i don't believe you you know we're still we're not coming out i 

256.07 257.67 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

258.37 259.41 A: [laughter] 

260.37 262.11 A: oh my gosh 

262.29 265.59 B: (( think like they they kinda changed their lifestyle )) 

265.99 269.44 B: almost negatively where they're more scared to do things 

269.27 271.51 A: mhm 

270.64 275.25 B: and but for me it's like you know you've got to you've got to enjoy life 

275.00 278.42 A: you've got to live it or else you know what's the point you know 

276.25 277.42 B: think yeah 

278.29 280.95 B: so have you flown a lot since september eleventh 

280.76 288.26 A: um well probably more than i ever have um because i'm i'm constantly flying back to california from boston so 

283.89 284.66 B: right 

286.48 287.68 B: (( right right )) 

288.29 292.68 A: i mean four times a year which is like more than i've ever flown like ever so 

292.88 297.47 A: i mean it's a situational thing it's not like i have a choice but um 

297.78 299.31 A: i mean that's fine 

298.18 299.74 B: (( mm )) 

300.85 303.96 B: and so have you changed your life in any other way like 

304.30 306.13 A: um i mean 

304.59 305.88 B: (( in terms of just )) 

306.90 310.40 B: (( being being more aware of people around you or )) 

310.36 314.45 A: i mean i i guess like 

311.22 311.98 B: (( you know )) 

314.97 317.77 A: i don't know i've never been like 

318.28 322.04 A: i don't know like initially it was more like you know 

322.12 327.43 A: keep close to the ones you love kind of thing you know 'cause you're you know they could be gone at any day you know 

327.69 337.36 A: so initially it was like oh my gosh you know my friends my family you know i really have to like you know say all the things i need to say kind of thing you know because you never know what could happen 

334.65 335.47 B: yeah 

337.19 338.29 B: mhm 

337.66 346.62 A: but after that initial you know month or two it things kinda just i don't think i've i've changed my views on stuff but i don't know 

346.41 354.71 B: right yeah i think i'm kinda the same like maybe i'm more aware of of friends and family and how you 

354.97 358.39 B: know easily people can be can be taken away 

358.50 360.62 A: mhm 

358.99 360.00 B: um 

361.30 367.24 B: but in terms of like the lifestyle i'm living like i haven't i haven't really changed that a lot 

367.33 370.55 B: um but just in terms of 

367.46 368.51 A: mhm 

371.09 380.34 B: you know like you were saying about telling people the things you need to tell 'em and stuff like that i am definitely more aware of the value of of relationships 

380.16 382.47 A: right 

383.23 393.96 A: so did you know of people who were affected by it like personally 'cause i think that too w- played a pa- part in my thing 'cause i really didn't know anyone who was affected personally you know 

383.31 384.06 B: yeah 

393.35 395.64 B: right well it's like i 

394.31 397.83 A: so i mean i think if i was i would probably i don't know 

397.56 401.22 B: yeah it'd probably affect me more 

400.94 402.05 A: mhm 

401.54 403.35 B: not really like i mean 

403.83 410.26 B: my wife's cousin is was affected in terms of the fact that his office had to be shut down 

410.55 413.19 B: 'cause it was quite near it was like a couple of blocks away 

410.62 411.53 A: mhm 

413.22 414.24 A: (( right [noise] )) 

413.38 419.40 B: um and so since then he's he's had to to find another job 

419.48 420.36 A: mhm 

421.73 428.02 B: but like in terms of people being injured and killed or anything you know we didn't we didn't know of anyone 

428.11 429.12 A: mhm 

428.66 430.15 B: thankfully 

429.72 431.38 A: i know i know 

430.83 433.05 B: (( that would've been really hard )) 

432.60 434.28 A: exactly 

435.68 440.02 A: and i think if you had that experience first hand it'd probably be much more 

440.56 442.08 A: harder you know 

441.04 442.78 B: (( um yeah yeah mhm )) 

444.86 451.42 A: it's just weird things like i know like my uncle flew on september eleventh like a year later 

450.89 451.85 B: mhm 

451.69 458.16 A: and he was like yeah the plane was kinda empty and he was like i never thought about it but when i got there you know people were like saying stuff and i was like oh 

458.14 469.62 A: and then a couple of my friends have flown the same flight from boston to l._a. and were like it's kinda weird you know but i don't think it's really i mean it i just think it takes time like everything you know everything 

469.66 474.37 A: that happens you always remember but it af- after a while time heals most things 

473.92 480.82 B: yeah oh yeah absolutely i think also kinda being everybody being rational as well 

476.26 477.23 A: so 

479.49 481.86 A: mhm 

480.86 487.03 B: and you know people like oh flying a year after september eleventh you know 

487.04 490.29 B: some a lot of people wouldn't do it i guess it's almost superstitious 

490.12 491.19 A: mhm 

490.88 493.69 B: but you know rationally it's like 

493.96 499.80 B: you know what are the chances of something happening exactly a year later you know there's a pretty small 

499.02 501.16 A: (( [noise] exactly )) 

500.24 506.81 B: and and i think with stuff like that it's kinda important to see the bigger picture 

506.87 509.17 A: mhm 

508.61 512.11 B: and kinda take things take things more rationally 

512.02 514.30 A: (( right )) 

512.83 514.01 B: as well 

517.59 519.86 A: anything else to add [laughter] 

519.15 523.07 B: um no i think that's it and um 

524.27 526.89 B: i think that's most of my thoughts on it 

526.36 528.06 A: yeah 

527.59 529.27 B: right 

529.33 531.14 B: how's the weather out in boston

555.71 556.86 B: (( oh no )) 

557.21 571.41 A: yeah it's been really just like oppressive heat which is so weird because it was it was the most horrendous winter i've ever experienced in my life it just was like winter for it just seemed to never end and then all of a sudden in june it went from like you know this 

559.57 560.76 B: (( yeah much the [noise] ))
