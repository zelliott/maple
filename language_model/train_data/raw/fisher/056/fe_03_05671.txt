1.41 2.56 A: hello 

2.22 3.32 B: (( how are you doing what's )) 

3.68 5.60 A: (( all right )) 

4.74 5.69 B: going on 

6.69 8.78 A: not a whole lot uh 

9.34 11.67 A: just just sitting around relaxing today 

11.60 15.82 B: yeah same thing so what do you think about the middle east so far 

16.19 26.65 A: what what do i think about it well it's lot of the stuff that ah actually it's a lot of stuff that was written thousands of years ago in scriptures 

17.33 18.99 B: yeah 

26.47 28.84 B: yeah i've read it what are you what race are 

29.14 30.78 A: what what race am i 

30.17 32.01 B: (( you y- yeah )) 

31.76 33.73 A: (( oh uh i'm white )) 

33.21 40.41 B: you're white i'm latin american so i i feel the same thing like my mom like she's always studied bibles and stuff 

35.07 35.99 A: okay 

40.02 40.95 A: uh-huh 

40.94 54.45 B: and i feel that that basically to me i see george bush and jeb bush and uh his father in ninety two being the three headed monster they talked about so that's like one of the things i see in the bible 

54.72 57.42 A: well let's put it this way i do see them as 

57.48 62.80 A: ah straying away in in what they originally proclaimed to believe 

62.20 74.37 B: exactly and that's th- that's the tongue and that's one thing they're talking about that that the tongue is going to be you know is going to be the cause of many wars between nations and stuff and that's what's going on as we speak right now so 

74.31 81.97 B: i feel it's all over oil because i don't even know what the facts were that like how much percentage they own fifty one percent of the world's oil 

81.61 89.64 A: well yeah that very well could be could be ah part of it i think you know that's probably part of it plus 

82.14 82.88 B: and 

88.66 98.02 B: but look at it this way george bush's family they're that's what they made their fortune off they're oil they're oil you know they're oil investors so 

97.07 99.93 A: that's a very interesting point 

98.44 106.51 B: what what better way to you know make money and don't tell me oh no no one's corrupt i mean it's been since since the beginning of time since you know 

106.48 116.14 B: we've been lying i mean bill clinton i know had relationships with that lady he lied about that you mean to tell me the government ain't going to sit down and lie about oh yeah let's invest more money let's take from come on man 

115.99 122.01 B: that's the best way to go about it that's how i feel you know we own everything we control everything we start policing the world 

122.37 124.09 B: but it's going to be a matter of time 

122.71 131.21 A: i i i put it to you this way originally originally when i uh back in when we when we voted for uh the election 

130.98 132.00 B: yeah 

131.46 142.78 A: i trie- i did support the man however and i- i'm trying to support him now but he's making it difficult by th- the shift in his uh foreign policy 

137.58 138.67 B: mhm 

141.65 152.33 B: i mean i i look at it like this i mean if you're going to go and you're going to stop terrorism and stop all that what's going on in colombia i mean they assassinate every president that ever goes against drug enforcement you know 

152.24 164.02 B: they they assassinate them and [mn] the reason why is 'cause they have such a bundle of money being with drugs and the secret service and that that they just this is just what i believe i'm not saying you know 

152.33 155.19 A: you're right you're absolutely right 

163.98 169.20 B: i just you know i look at it there's more to it than what they're saying 'cause i used to live in miami 

168.98 169.89 A: okay 

169.33 175.86 B: and i just moved to michigan and i would see i mean just fishing off the pier with my uncle and dad i would see 

174.79 176.23 A: what's your name by the way 

175.89 177.59 B: oh walter nice to meet you 

176.82 178.33 A: walter my name's scott 

177.98 179.33 B: all right nice to meet you 

179.11 180.33 A: nice to meet you too 

180.10 181.33 B: and um 

181.29 195.40 B: i would see drug busts in front of my face you know coast guards and all and the way these people do it you know so it's like it's all money involved when it comes down to the bottom line you me your boss my boss the people who run this thing it's all money at the end of the day you know 

195.40 209.02 B: sad sad but true that's how i you know i perceive it and it's just it's going to be a matter of time before we you know we backfire ourselves in the ass with that it's a matter of time 'cause right now two two thousand and three 

208.98 216.57 B: i say by twenty nine two oh nine or two ten is it 'cause everything will be installed computers right now we're converting 

217.08 224.54 B: com- telephone lines to computer lines all you know digital f- digital optical cable fiber cable and that's it when 

223.19 229.88 A: yeah [mn] it's funny you should say that i'm a i'm a employee of uh of a m- major telecommunications company 

229.44 240.16 B: so you know what i'm talking about 'cause my cousin he does that down south he's rewiring he's rerouting wire for cab- charter cable in at&t and he told me the plans they got about how they're going to do it so 

235.18 236.19 A: okay 

240.32 246.40 B: that's how i picture it once it becomes you know everything into the computer that's it they'll have you in the system and basically do what they want with you 

246.55 250.14 B: [sigh] so that's how i just feel we need to either 

250.28 254.93 B: get ourselves together or just lose what we got and that's basically what it's turning into 

255.90 257.81 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

255.97 259.98 B: 'cause the country country's turning to shit if you look at it if you don't have money you can't do nothing 

260.12 265.97 B: you know and it's been like that since the beginning of time first reason anglo you know anglo saxons left europe 

266.19 270.38 B: was to stop tax you know not to pay tax cuts and freedom of religion 

270.71 277.26 B: and right now we're going right back to the same thing we we argue amongst ourselves over taxes you know should 

277.46 288.91 B: the middle class you know pay taxes so they get that four hundred dollar tax break um they just said the other day right now remember i don't know if you heard that new bill d- right now deciding over overtime 

290.41 291.81 B: have you heard about that one 

291.65 293.00 A: what's that again 

292.37 304.58 B: they're they're right now congress is talking about a bill for overtime for people who make for i think over a hundred k. a year should they get it or not and that's becoming a big issue it's all it's coming down to money like all of it's coming down to money 

304.63 306.14 B: and that that 

304.83 306.95 A: yeah that's that's interesting 

306.33 314.37 B: that's all of us you know that's like all of us is together and we're we're losing focus on it we're really like values are just going all towards money money money money 

313.80 318.18 A: but like but get- but getting back to the subject at hand with the middle east now um 

318.87 319.73 A: now 

320.96 327.47 A: don't get me wrong i'm not saying that we should necessarily just take sides and and um 

327.52 331.68 A: i'm not s- even though i'm i i i'll tell you i'm a pro israel person 

331.25 332.47 B: right 

332.04 334.47 A: but i um 

334.73 342.24 A: i think we should we should get back to trying to be you know what the problem is we're trying to do something that 

342.30 345.16 A: the scriptures say that we're not going to succeed in doing 

344.72 345.79 B: exactly 

345.66 346.87 A: scriptures 

346.91 349.53 A: make it very clear that that 

349.57 353.10 A: man is not going to be the one to establish peace 

352.99 354.33 B: (( i i believe that too )) 

354.95 360.28 A: a- and in fact the false th- what's actually going to happen is a very very 

361.36 363.79 A: um charismatic 

363.83 371.49 A: and uh very dashing person is going to come on the scene and a lot of people are going to believe that he's looking f- that he really wants to give answers 

371.86 374.63 A: and this guy's not going to give answers at all 

373.93 375.38 B: (( [mn] he's going to start a war )) 

375.04 380.37 A: he's going lead people to the slaught- he's going to basically in essence going to lead people to the slaughter 

379.80 381.51 B: exactly i believe it too 

381.64 382.53 B: [noise] 

382.66 384.25 B: i know exactly what you're saying 

383.48 390.89 A: so it's it's like it's like a catch twenty two situation ever since the reestablishment of israel back in nineteen forty eight 

390.45 391.61 B: (( right mhm )) 

390.91 399.45 A: ah there was no of course the the people of the arab world went crazy when that happened because they didn't want the existence of israel 

399.78 406.83 B: exactly it's been like that for thousands of years though they haven't wanted israel to exist this is nothing new this is only just out of the woodwork you know 

406.37 413.91 A: right this was like this was a matter of ah you had one one one was esau was it esau 

408.64 409.38 B: (( [cough] )) 

414.81 417.79 A: and the other one was ah jacob 

418.61 419.78 B: um 

419.50 420.81 A: something like that 

420.17 421.23 B: brothers 

421.00 422.34 A: yeah 

421.84 428.53 B: yeah i i mean i have to go back to the bible and read but i just know that for years they've you know thousands of years they 

428.65 442.37 B: for some reason they've been persecuting them i see it like this you know as an example if you want something put down or put away or destroyed or what not it's because they or it contain something that is a liable threat to you 

442.57 453.84 B: and if you do that that means you take them out of the woodwork you win everything but if you can't that means you're in jeopardy and that's why i think it's been like that egyptians started persecute them the germans you know and now 

453.61 461.45 B: it's going between this thousand year fight we're between them the palestines and israel you know it's like there's more to that than what people see 

461.46 463.74 B: you know everybody just takes everything as 

463.81 467.78 B: the world you know the world just ah 

468.31 478.84 B: [mn] tongue tied the world just concentrates like on four walls and a roof there's there's more in this world you know we there's been things here before we've been here you know you're like the first person i've talked to 

479.36 487.57 B: [mn] since i moved up here that even know that the bible's around you know like people just i i you know i look at people and it's like to me

490.30 492.29 B: and she's like really religious 

492.71 497.57 B: and one thing she's always told me [mn] you know want to find out what happens at the end you go back to the beginning 

497.23 501.44 A: well you're talking to a guy that was brought up in the urban portion of new york 

500.85 502.69 B: okay so yeah

543.43 549.32 B: now when that war goes on you're going to have to have the eyes and the ears for that and that's the same way i look at it [cough] 

549.33 550.73 B: 'cause i went through 

550.67 553.90 B: my life as you know certain events 

553.76 566.25 B: structured my life the way i started believing things and everything that happened to me i thought it happened for a reason 'cause the same thing with me i didn't meet m- my parents 'til i was about seventeen i was in a foster home the whole time i basically you know
