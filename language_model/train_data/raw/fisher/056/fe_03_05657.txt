3.55 4.76 B: hi rodney 

4.93 5.82 A: hello 

5.73 7.10 B: hello rodney 

7.09 8.36 A: your name is rodney 

8.14 8.97 B: yeah 

8.71 11.41 A: ah my name is oscar how are you doing 

10.50 12.65 B: uh i'm doing all right 

12.66 15.80 A: so the theme is ah airport security 

15.48 17.47 B: yeah airport security 

16.85 18.73 A: yeah and if you think it works 

19.08 20.41 B: ah 

21.25 27.01 B: me [mn] i think it may work but it may not be able to catch everyone 

27.86 28.89 A: mhm 

27.90 30.36 B: but it may work it may work 

30.48 33.30 B: you know but not everyone they'll be able to catch 

33.25 42.31 A: i think it works mostly to catch ah crazy people who decide to go on planes and you know and do crazy things but i think professionals 

39.22 40.68 B: yeah 

42.02 45.75 B: (( yeah professional people y- you know it it may not work )) 

45.16 47.53 A: they're better trained than the security 

47.30 53.78 B: (( yeah because it's like it's like a crazy person might decide to take a knife on the plane )) 

53.82 57.32 B: you know or take a gun on the plane but you know 

57.38 65.99 B: a professional person going to get through the airport security very easy 'cause you know they know how to bypass airport security 

65.45 67.86 A: yeah airport security is not that well trained 

67.83 68.98 B: so 

68.10 73.56 A: you know they're not they're not police officer or anything like that they're normal people who who just take the training in security 

71.76 72.97 B: (( yeah normal people )) 

73.39 78.42 B: yeah they just they just hire them and tell them look search this bag search bags 

78.67 86.01 B: you know they give them a little basic training but actually some of them don't know actually what they're looking for you know they're just looking at the monitor to 

83.27 84.22 A: mhm 

86.12 89.09 B: see what's in the bag you know 

89.23 92.46 B: sometimes the monitor itself doesn't pick up everything 

92.15 94.63 A: no no no i know it doesn't 

93.99 105.78 B: yeah so there could be they could hide something in their bag a knife and it'd go through the the scanner and the scanner didn't pick it up they can't see it on the monitor but you got a knife in your bag 

101.40 102.66 A: yeah 

104.41 109.59 A: or if you just if you look away for a second while your bag is passing by that's it 

109.37 110.27 B: (( yeah all they )) 

110.59 114.65 B: got to do is have somebody pick up your bag so you somebody walk in together 

114.89 116.26 B: just look away 

116.22 117.48 A: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

116.46 122.44 B: they pick your bag up but you know they're spending all this money on the airport security and you know 

123.62 129.51 B: but they need to get like police or these people to do it instead of hiring these security people 

128.67 131.89 A: yeah better trained people though to do that kind of work 

130.45 138.79 B: yeah better trained which is not yeah which is not working out but no but so far they haven't catched no terrorists or nothing yet but 

138.35 140.09 A: [laughter] that is true 

139.14 141.55 B: (( [laughter] they don't catch nothing yet )) 

142.08 145.48 B: (( you know they only catch people who take in like knives )) 

144.58 146.45 A: needles and 

146.57 151.98 B: yeah because you know the airports nowadays you know they ain't serving people with no forks or nothing 

152.03 152.96 B: so 

153.25 156.75 B: (( you have to be pretty silly to take [mn] on you know things on the plane )) 

154.85 160.10 A: yeah i think it's also a way they have it to uh make people feel more comfortable 

160.36 162.36 A: while while they travel 

162.29 164.17 B: yeah 'cause most people wasn't 

164.24 175.76 B: flying because of that so by doing that airport security you know people feel a little more comfortable [mn] okay there's more security so the airport is more tighter so it's safer but 

171.02 171.87 A: yeah 

172.45 173.84 A: it's safer but 

175.89 179.40 B: still it's not safer 'cause you don't know who is a terrorist or not 

179.44 180.54 A: exactly 

180.32 185.08 B: you know anybody could be a terrorist on the plane and get past security airport security 

185.36 186.41 B: so 

186.56 193.34 A: oh and i think anybody who's a terrorist who's really the re- who's trained and is the real thing they're harder to spot 

187.14 188.01 B: you know 

193.71 195.80 B: yeah because 

194.39 198.77 A: you know they're not going to look like our idea of a terrorist 

198.08 203.50 B: yeah they could but but the airport security is kind of tight because 

204.42 213.73 B: ah a few months ago i went through a problem with airport security [laughter] it's kind of tight they want a thing you have you do you know it was like too much 

213.82 217.41 B: (( yeah too much i nearly missed my flight and all that so )) 

213.87 214.72 A: yeah 

217.57 220.38 B: you know it was too much security i mean you got a 

220.84 232.80 B: (( [mn] you know you got to sit down on a chair and do all this crap lift your right leg up your left leg and you know all this crap all this crap i had to go through airport security and all later i had to take my boots off )) 

225.86 227.58 A: [laughter] 

233.17 234.92 A: got to take your shoes off 

234.60 244.34 B: yeah i'm already mad already 'cause i was late already for my plane the woman gave me the wrong ticket i had to go back up there and get the correct ticket i was like 

244.46 245.36 A: wow 

244.59 252.30 B: you know so but mm but the security was all right but yeah you know it's just too much 

252.43 254.84 B: too much security too much things they're doing 

254.96 257.29 B: i just find there's too much things they're doing 

257.83 258.81 B: you know 

258.85 260.66 B: for airport security they're 

260.93 266.09 A: the last time i flew i wore sandals so they didn't make me take my shoes off i just wore sandals 

266.03 270.67 B: yeah yeah i think they should make the security a little 

271.17 274.98 B: more efficient but not having to do all this check 

274.80 276.15 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

275.55 279.53 B: all this checking that they got to do make you take your shoes off they should make it much easier 

279.77 283.82 B: you know so you don't have to go through all that check and then there's a big line 

283.91 285.42 B: for the check 

286.08 290.42 B: you know people might be running late and you're holding up all those people who are running late 

287.73 289.25 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

289.83 291.33 A: people miss flights 

291.33 294.55 B: (( yeah because they have to stand up in line and wait for this done )) 

294.56 295.72 B: (( to finish )) 

295.78 297.46 B: (( so you know )) 

296.72 303.22 A: first the big line to get the ticket then it's a big line to get into a section of the airport 

302.57 307.60 B: yeah so they should try to they should try to improve on it make it a little simpler you 

308.38 312.06 B: know make airport security a little simpler than how it is right now 

312.95 316.18 B: (( and i feel right now it's too it's just too much )) 

316.45 318.38 A: mhm i agree i agree 

317.69 324.32 B: yeah just too much it should be a lot simpler but hey they spend all this money on secur- airport security 

324.60 328.01 B: [laughter] you know 

328.22 330.78 B: (( we'll see if it works or not )) 

330.28 332.53 A: well hopefully it does 

332.24 337.94 B: yeah hopefully it does but you know terrorists still looking out there so 

338.49 340.12 A: yeah they always find a way 

340.16 341.63 B: (( yeah )) 

340.34 342.60 A: and airplanes are just one way you know 

342.78 346.90 B: yeah so they don't know when but [mn] they're still looking out there 

346.62 347.68 A: yeah 

347.00 349.20 B: (( but for now but for now we can say )) 

347.78 349.01 A: unfortunately 

349.39 352.72 B: yeah but for now you can say the airport is kind of safe 

353.22 356.25 B: you know security's kind of safe you can say that for now 

356.08 357.80 A: yeah 

357.15 362.62 B: you know we don't know later on what's going to happen but you know for now it's working 

362.77 372.13 A: i feel safer to be honest just 'cause i know you know at least a crazy guy will not crazy people will not be able to most probably get past 

372.18 378.87 B: (( yeah yeah i felt a little bit safer when i went on the plane i wasn't scared at all you know i just thought you know if something happens it happens )) 

379.50 381.91 B: you know you know but 

380.38 382.87 A: i guess if it's meant to happen to you
