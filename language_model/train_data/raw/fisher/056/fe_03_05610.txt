0.56 1.59 B: (( hi )) 

1.75 2.85 B: (( hi i'm felix )) 

1.81 3.58 A: hel- hello 

3.02 4.56 B: yeah yeah hi 

3.71 5.92 A: [noise] i'm my name is matt [noise] 

5.86 7.80 B: my name is felix hi how are you 

7.77 17.78 A: i'm all right so wh- uh did i understand it correctly that that we're supposed to talk about uh how high athletes are how athletes are paid [noise] their high salaries 

8.78 9.64 B: okay 

16.41 25.42 B: yeah about uh uh their them going on strike and in general like their salaries and whether they should go on strike or whether they should not go on strike 

25.88 28.75 A: oh okay i didn't catch that part of it on the cell 

28.08 31.37 B: yeah it's hard to heard uh okay 

29.62 30.56 A: okay 

30.70 31.48 A: um 

32.23 33.92 A: go ahead and sound off 

34.04 35.01 B: well 

35.07 37.70 B: it's kind usually i've always been 

37.77 42.79 B: i don't know the baseball strikes and the threatened basketball strike you know it always 

42.83 48.59 B: seems to hurt the fans the most now i i think the athletes are paid 

45.31 47.25 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

49.31 53.03 B: way too much money sometimes and they're overpaying perks 

53.20 60.11 B: and [sigh] it's just the fans get hurt the most of course but as well as the business overall 

53.21 54.80 A: mhm 

57.24 59.03 A: mhm 

60.18 61.13 A: okay 

60.52 62.63 B: what what do you think 

62.31 63.30 A: um 

63.46 65.79 A: i pretty much think that uh 

66.04 73.39 A: [noise] they're they're kinda doing uh for better or for worse i agree with you a hundred percent the fans are the ones who end up getting hurt 

73.20 85.31 A: but the guy who's played baseball his whole life and is better than his co you know his his teammates or the rest of the guys in his league if he's head above if he's head and shoulders above the average 

85.31 100.24 A: he's gonna wanna maximize his income it's just it's human nature they're gonna wanna make the most of it what i think is wrong is i think that the system is what's evil and that if you have something like the system that the n._f._l. has where you 

100.05 107.72 A: you know you have salary caps then you don't let it eat itself to death which is what the baseball and the n._h._l. are doing [noise] 

107.84 121.57 A: so i blame it uh you know i see this i see the um i see the athletes as doing what by human nature they're trying to optimize what they can do for themselves because that's what they can do with the system 

121.67 133.29 A: and it it's it definitely hurts the fans but the stupidity in in my opinion lies with the the um whoever is you know is is preventing 

133.76 140.62 A: something a little more kind of for lack of a better word a little more socialist like what the n._f._l. has where it's all even 

141.17 153.75 B: well i i i think possibly you might need a salary cap but i also think that when they go on strike they go on strike collectively so it's not just a the high stake players but they're also forcing 

141.63 143.17 A: (( and it )) 

153.77 155.38 B: (( i i they'd )) 

155.67 161.39 B: bargaining themselves forcing the whole game to be shut down including the not so good players 

161.40 170.28 B: um and we might need a salary cap i agree in the foot- there hasn't been a strike in the n._f._l. for what since what sixteen years since eighty seven or maybe 

169.63 172.38 A: (( [noise] mm in in in football )) 

172.46 181.40 B: in football yeah there was one in eighty seven i think where they uh but in baseball you know it's been ridiculous uh every 

174.71 177.15 A: right right [noise] 

181.72 183.21 B: five years i mean they 

183.34 189.53 B: in ninety four was the first time that they basically cancelled the world series 

189.08 191.84 A: uh-huh that's when montreal was gonna win 

190.06 200.77 B: i i i mean i understand i understand it and i support the free market system where we're we all wanna get maximized but i you know i mean but i think if you agree with the salary cap is that what you were saying 

200.87 203.70 A: oh yeah there has to be a salary cap [noise] 

203.12 209.90 B: right i think in sports i mean they can't impose it on themselves they can impose a salary cap for the league 

209.79 210.74 A: mhm 

210.03 214.91 B: but otherwise i i come from philadelphia are you too are you also from philadelphia 

214.29 218.68 A: i'm from i'm from pittsburgh but i live in new i'm calling you from new york right now [noise] 

215.80 217.47 B: okay okay well 

217.98 229.78 B: right so there's there's been case where we had a few years ago in baseball where the the rookie where we had a draft pick a first round draft pick j. d. drew and he wanted an enormous sum of money 

229.32 231.03 A: what was what year was this 

230.60 233.67 B: and uh it's a few years ago j. d. drew 

233.70 234.60 A: okay 

233.76 246.04 B: um and you know like uh he we didn't sign him and we the phillies took a lot of heat for that but but somebody and but somebody in uh st louis they offered him an enormous paycheck 

246.20 249.04 B: (( and he signed with them so )) 

248.28 250.28 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

249.09 263.31 B: i think that's if you have a salary cap you you might you can't have like the if the owners try to hold down and say no we're not going to give you this enormous sum because it you're killing you're killing the game but there's always someone that does do it i mean 

262.24 263.12 A: mhm 

263.10 265.91 B: (( and i think )) 

265.94 269.53 B: in the in the that salary cap in order to 

270.13 272.24 B: [lipsmack] keep prices under control because 

272.40 275.58 B: it's the even if the players get those 

275.67 279.66 B: the contract it's the fans that will have to foot the bill 

279.53 281.37 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

280.72 288.47 B: ma- many of the times most of the time actually because the the owners you know they they rarely lose they're 

288.64 294.39 B: always gonna mak- find out how to make money and pass it on along to the fans the the bills that is 

294.41 296.05 A: right 

295.71 305.73 B: so i usually i don't know i usually feel like the players are pampered babies a lot of the time i mean if you're playing playing professionally you're doing something that millions 

306.06 311.28 B: have dreamed of doing or or or or dreaming about doing and generally you get play 

311.07 322.73 B: for your career to get to make the big money even if you're getting the the league minimum which is what still five figures you know six figures yeah six figures you you're still 

319.61 324.63 A: [noise] [noise] mhm six figures i think the minimum in the n._f._l. is like uh 

324.81 329.97 A: [noise] two twenty and i i think it might even less for baseball though i think there's a greater range 

330.36 331.54 B: right well 

331.76 341.33 B: you know six figures you know how many people get to make over a hundred thousand you know right or wrong having the minimum wage being [laughter] you know in six figures or five yeah 

339.93 347.91 A: [noise] yeah yeah and only have to work a hundred and eighty gam- eighty days of the year [noise] or what and that's excluding training camps too you know [noise] [noise] [noise] 

344.72 345.76 B: yeah 

346.83 353.90 B: well yeah i mean you don't you well yeah they do work but they get to play they get to keep in shape and they get you know 

354.00 357.22 B: three three months six months off de- depending on how 

356.72 357.35 A: [noise] [noise] 

357.41 361.20 B: how they play there's a greater risk of injury but 

362.16 363.07 B: (( so )) 

363.27 365.08 B: i don't know how how it uh 

365.22 369.99 B: how it'll turn out hopefully there won't be any more strikes i remember the basketball strike a few years ago 

370.34 373.21 B: uh they cancelled the all pro game in philadelphia 

372.67 374.17 A: yeah 

373.82 376.44 B: when they had the basketball players strike 

376.10 376.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

378.04 380.53 B: (( there has to be some agreement i think for the fans )) 

380.80 385.42 B: observe the ultimate one if you remember how baseball took a nosedive after the strike 

385.86 395.62 A: well baseball's definitely i think uh i think the numbers are going down for baseball in general [noise] like it's just [noise] becoming entirely uh 

397.66 402.19 A: less popular as a whole and and i think i think that the 

399.88 411.57 B: that's true in general but i think the recent the recent um it's actually i think maybe even hit rock bottom recently and picked up a bit because of the home run race and uh the 

410.68 413.61 A: because of which because of what 

412.67 416.54 B: home the home run race a few years ago with mcguire and salsa 

415.88 418.13 A: right right yeah 

417.42 431.44 B: and i mean there are some interest i mean it really hit roc- rock bottom after the years following the strikes but i mean certain things you know certain things and now they offer game gains for home field advantage in the world series and there are few very exciting world series 

431.63 434.12 B: you know the last few world series were pretty exciting 

433.89 435.93 A: yeah they were pretty damn exciting 

434.24 445.32 B: i think they have a chance but to at least capitalize on the maybe small emerging momentum but another strike like uh we were discussion you 

446.03 449.53 B: know they just the recent you know a 

449.57 452.94 B: year what a year ago or something that there might have been another strike 

453.58 458.04 B: or just well even if the umpires you know that that hurts a lot 

458.12 460.72 A: yeah yeah because 

459.19 462.62 B: just nobody wants to be replaced yeah go ahead 

461.29 467.76 A: yeah you get that 'cause you get that relative greed you know like that's what i meant about the players like yeah i know about the guys 

464.37 465.17 B: yeah 

467.99 481.48 A: i i i know i kinda got a little slightly off track but like all those guys when they see all their team mates making the [noise] they feel like well you know by by simply by the fact that i'm in this on this team i should be making 

481.45 490.18 A: you know if i'm sixth in the batting order then i i should be making you know this much money and my perform- and my numbers that i'm putting up are like this 

490.40 492.49 A: so it's like then when 

492.40 502.58 A: the referees see that too then they start to say whoa whoa whoa you know any any of the officials they're like whoa whoa whoa all these guys are making this money we're working it we have to make sure that they do their job right 

496.68 497.46 B: right 

502.59 509.19 A: you know how 'bout how 'bout we get paid at least a tenth of what they're making you know when we're not making that much or whatever it might be [noise] 

506.32 507.10 B: right 

509.37 513.66 A: and um yeah it's just like it's just like greed just sort of like 

513.85 517.80 A: it's sort of uh what's the word i'm looking for it kind of um [lipsmack] 

517.31 519.55 B: (( yeah in impolitic uh )) 

519.60 521.45 B: everybody's lying 

521.24 531.89 A: right yeah it it just kinda rubs off on one another but but i think [noise] that pretty i i like to see when the government gets involved in a strike and saying you know 

532.07 541.32 A: uh no you know when i who was it who got involved in baseball in interfering with the strike was it bush or clinton i can't even remember 

540.11 555.00 B: i don't remember i i yeah i don't agree with the government interfering i don't think the government should interfere in the strike the only time i support well this is maybe getting it off track um any kind of government takeover or whatever inferring is when it relates to some kind of 

551.40 553.42 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

554.94 562.46 B: uh either public employees or employees that serve the public such as police officers or 

562.61 574.39 B: like i know there's a law somewhere on the book that you can't have a police there has to be mandatory arbitration you can't have like police officers all go on strike so i think this is i think this has to be this is all within the league 

568.42 570.00 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

574.51 582.99 B: i mean they are they're private companies and i think as a league they play for one league they can impose a salary cap i don't think it should come down from the government 

583.34 584.48 B: personally 

584.58 591.52 A: if it's if it comes [noise] to the point where it's like the arbitration where they're ignoring the arbitration rules 

591.61 599.89 A: then something like i remember it wasn't it wasn't exactly [noise] the president per se it was like the attorney general at the time and he's like no no no we're gonna break this up
