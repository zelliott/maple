1.00 3.42 A: (( hello this is rafiel heffenboy )) 

3.55 6.21 B: uh hi this is mark molynix how are you 

6.13 13.31 A: i'm doing excellent mark [sigh] you know what i didn't hear the am- um the amount of the minimum wage 

13.55 16.61 A: um during the recording do you remember what it was 

16.71 19.59 B: um the amount of the minimum wage increase or 

19.28 20.11 A: yeah 

20.21 23.74 B: uh i believe they said five dollars and fifteen cents 

24.07 27.71 B: and they asked whether it was sufficient 

27.14 28.74 A: and they asked if what 

28.58 34.06 B: uh they asked whether we believe that that amount is sufficient or the minimum wage should be increased further 

34.74 35.56 A: uh-huh 

36.68 38.26 A: [sigh] interesting 

38.50 43.69 A: did it mention at all what the base salary was what the the base wage was 

44.02 44.58 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

45.23 48.91 B: i'm sorry i'm actually having a little trouble hearing you could could you speak up a little bit 

48.91 55.74 A: you know what i was about to say the same thing i wasn't being being able to hear you it must be my cellphone i'm on my cellphone [mn] 

55.17 58.90 B: oh so am i i think they might match us that way um 

56.52 57.49 A: (( oh oh )) 

58.24 59.36 A: [laughter] 

59.28 61.74 B: i'll try to talk better is this a little bit better 

61.61 65.50 A: yeah th- that is i and i'll try and speak louder too is that better too 

62.91 63.85 B: okay 

65.57 66.99 B: yeah that's much better 

66.88 69.36 A: (( excellent [mn] so )) 

68.19 70.62 B: uh so what do you think about the minimum wage 

71.07 72.45 A: um [lipsmack] 

71.22 71.78 B: (( [sigh] )) 

72.97 74.74 A: i think that anything that's 

74.97 77.15 A: not at equilibrium 

77.20 80.18 A: is not the most efficient thing to do 

80.50 83.98 A: but i do think that there there could be reasons [sigh] 

84.84 88.97 A: um for which a company would want to 

89.28 96.31 A: have a a minimum wage higher than the average than the current market minimum wage 

96.61 105.65 B: okay i definitely think that right now the minimum wage is very low because it's it's lower than the level that would be required to actually support a family if uh 

96.75 98.01 A: for example 

100.80 101.59 A: (( mhm )) 

105.44 116.42 B: if a worker has a a job at the current minimum wage level it's nearly impossible for them to support even themselves but especially if they have either um a spouse or children 

109.17 110.07 A: (( mhm )) 

116.41 120.67 B: there's no way that they can make enough money working forty hours a week at that wage 

116.52 117.50 A: true 

120.97 122.69 A: and now where do you live 

121.05 122.98 B: [mn] so i think i would support it being 

123.55 127.10 A: what's where do you live and what's the minimum wage where you are [noise] 

127.14 135.88 B: i'm living in wisconsin and i actually don't know the minimum wage here i think it's five dollars and thirty five cents so it's a little bit higher than the federal 

131.65 132.54 A: uh-huh 

135.98 141.56 B: um but i am not really sure i haven't kept up to date i've only moved here recently 

135.98 136.92 A: uh-huh 

141.77 142.76 A: uh-huh 

142.01 143.40 B: how about where you live 

143.48 145.98 A: i'm in utah and uh 

146.12 147.88 A: i know it's also 

148.16 151.65 A: less than five dollars but i think it's five seventy five 

151.84 152.80 B: okay 

152.76 155.15 A: which is a a qu- a little bit 

155.63 162.00 A: higher than where you are in wisconsin and what about the cost of living in wisconsin 

162.07 177.07 B: um well i'm in a fairly large city so the cost of living is a little bit higher here um i would imagine that it's lower than utah i actually spent some time in new mexico as well and uh the cost of living out there was substantially lower than it is here 

167.98 168.85 A: uh-huh 

172.97 173.99 A: oh okay 

177.05 190.39 B: um heating and cooling costs were less and i think in wisconsin probably because it is so far north um the the costs of uh heating the home in the winter make it even worse in terms of cost of living 

179.76 180.65 A: uh-huh 

189.50 190.68 A: that's right 

191.17 192.28 A: i agree 

193.01 201.97 A: i agree so the combination is is not sounding very good in wisconsin 'cause you have a lower [sigh] minimum wage and higher cost of living 

202.30 203.45 A: so 

202.39 203.56 B: exactly 

203.81 205.73 A: that that's really not good 

205.67 207.71 B: no i i think that uh 

206.06 206.90 A: well 

207.56 210.21 B: it's very difficult to live on minimum wage i 

210.02 224.95 B: i don't know anybody who makes the minimum uh even actually most of the traditional minimum wage jobs around here pay a little bit more than that or else offer the opportunity for overtime [sigh] which of course increases the uh earning potential for the workers pretty substantially 

220.10 221.09 A: uh-huh 

224.90 226.06 A: that's right 

225.82 228.52 B: although it lowers the quality of life 

228.39 231.62 A: true now do you believe in in uh 

231.86 235.67 A: keeping it at whatever the market wage would be 

236.03 236.60 B: [sigh] 

236.62 240.85 B: i think it's a a really difficult question uh 

240.95 243.52 B: for there to be a federal minimum wage 

243.72 247.31 B: helps in some situations but is it makes it uh 

247.37 261.00 B: [sigh] it's it's almost irrelevant in others for instance as you mentioned utah the uh the state minimum wage is actually higher than the federal minimum [sigh] i think that in in states where there's a a large immigrant population or uh or other 

255.63 256.68 A: that's right 

261.23 275.35 B: unusual labor conditions the federal minimum wage needs to be in place [mn] to ensure that there's a baseline level but it seems like in other places [sigh] the market really does dictate the minimum wage more than the guidelines do because there are uh 

275.44 282.01 B: in a tight labor market you have to offer more salary um to your workers anyway [sigh] 

280.70 281.87 A: that's right 

282.98 284.41 B: so it seems like it 

283.08 284.74 A: because what i believe 

285.02 289.99 A: is that if there were people that would be willing to work for less 

290.45 292.00 A: it's because 

294.12 302.50 A: because that's what they have to offer and if they're willing to to work for that money i think the economy should take advantage of that 

302.26 316.00 A: and i think that actually the minimum wage only benefits a very small portion of the of the economy being the the um immigrants as you mentioned and also high school students 

316.22 320.50 A: which don't really mean it uh don't really need it [mn] 

316.30 317.93 B: oh that's very true yes 

320.46 329.11 A: um but that the immigrants do need it sometimes very badly but um [lipsmack] since they come from from situations 

329.04 331.29 A: that were even worse than that 

331.18 342.45 A: if they are willing to work for less i think the economy would benefit from that and i don't think that would be immoral or even it's just amoral 

342.29 352.23 A: because it's really what they're willing to do and it's an improvement from what it is and once they gain new skills they'll naturally 

352.38 354.81 A: want a higher salary [cough] 

355.17 363.98 A: excuse me and then the market rate will keep working on itself and i think the economy could benefit from having lower 

364.02 370.58 A: cost of production through the lower wages to those employees that are willing to work for that money uh-huh 

370.91 373.66 B: now the the question about that though is 

373.89 378.76 B: is that in some way discriminatory towards those people who are coming in 

379.04 393.11 B: if as you said [sigh] they're willing to work for less because they've always had less and this is still an improvement for them in a way that segregates them out of any higher paying jobs because they're the only ones who will take those lower paying jobs 

393.04 394.05 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

394.23 403.20 B: i i wonder if that causes uh while it's while it's efficient economically i wonder if that causes some issues in terms of how the uh 

403.54 409.67 B: how immigrants are able to to get other work if if they're the only ones willing to work at that wage 

409.41 410.42 A: uh-huh 

409.91 413.20 B: where will they gain the skills to to improve 

413.89 416.66 B: i i i'm not entirely making sense but uh 

416.40 427.02 A: that is a good question though what i believe mark is that those immigrants that have better skills [sigh] just the mere fact that they are immigrants won't determine 

427.22 433.37 A: them making less than the minimum wage for example i am an an immigrant myself 

433.44 437.44 A: um and um i am trying to get the skills 

437.29 445.85 A: to to get better salaries and i would definitely never work for the for the minimum wage [sigh] um so 

445.62 459.23 A: i think it's not so much an issue of whether you're an immigrant or not [mn] it's the kind of skills you bring into the into the labor force [sigh] 'cause when you look at it from the when i look at it from the immigrant point of view 

459.07 465.42 A: that i hear so much on on discussions on this topic is we're looking at them only as immigrants 

465.39 479.35 A: instead of looking at them as individuals that are coming here to contribute their skills into the economy [mn] and if you mix them with with all the rest of the people and don't even look at that what would you pay for this individual but you don't even know who this person is 

479.23 494.09 A: and you just find out what their skills are and i would i would see wh- how much i would pay those person and not even worry whether [sigh] wheth- whether the person is an immigrant or not [sigh] but i know that for example if i told this to my sister she would kill me because she [sigh] 

489.66 490.97 B: right of course 

494.31 502.32 A: is more thinking you know at the individual level and at the person level and she thinks no one should make that kind of money 

503.34 515.63 A: and and she does have a point in one sense but i'm an economics major and sometimes i have a hard time looking at [sigh] at the picture that at at that small a level i am i like to see things at the economy wide level 

515.52 517.97 B: [laughter] i can tell you're an economics major [mn] 

517.81 518.87 A: [laughter] 

518.10 524.31 B: i i guess the issue i have with the minimum wage is it applies so much to unskilled labor 

524.22 525.22 A: uh-huh 

524.47 534.42 B: um really most of the positions that you see at a at a minimum wage level i'm discounting things like waitresses where there's tips involved as well but uh 

533.40 534.66 A: correct uh-huh 

534.68 537.12 B: your construction worker or 

537.17 540.31 B: whatever the the minimum wage type jobs 

540.40 546.43 B: so often are uh really require no skills and so i guess in that sense i can see how [sigh] 

545.06 546.03 A: that's right 

546.30 556.76 B: the minimum wage jobs as as you said the market dictates and that actually helps people who might not be able to get a higher paying job you know regardless of their background simply due to their skill level 

553.73 554.78 A: that's right 

555.35 556.28 A: (( that's right )) 

556.92 557.95 A: that's right 

558.67 564.37 A: that's right and you bring up a point a really interesting point because if you look at it from the employer's point of view [sigh] 

558.73 559.29 B: (( [mn] )) 

564.89 572.47 A: i can't be forced to pay to this employee more than this employee is going to bring into my company 

572.88 577.06 A: or contribute to my company so i think that is a little bit unfair [sigh] 

577.14 579.50 A: to force them to pay people 

579.73 584.23 A: more than they than they actually than their contribution is worth 

584.99 586.46 A: (( so yeah )) 

585.47 589.61 B: that that makes a lot of sense right now of course all these uh 

589.69 599.89 B: assumptions get much more difficult because we're in such a uh tight labor market with all of the unemployment that's currently [sigh] out there i don't know how it is with you 

595.49 596.73 A: true
