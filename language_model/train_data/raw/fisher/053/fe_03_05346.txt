90.14 93.72 A: um no i i i got him off the street 

93.57 95.03 B: okay that's why 

95.33 96.26 A: oh 

95.41 96.88 B: (( [noise] that's why )) 

97.21 99.59 B: hah you found him on the street 

97.99 99.96 A: and he took on two pit bulls 

99.66 101.39 B: you found him on the street then 

101.26 102.62 A: yeah 

102.00 105.66 B: wow so it's a good dog but yeah he's had little 

105.68 118.79 B: problems yeah i kind of get that he's sad but that's okay i'm psychic so [sigh] i pick things up but it's okay he's a good dog he'll work through it you just got to love him so tell me about what you first of all i got two cats 

106.68 107.76 A: yeah 

118.64 119.65 A: okay 

119.21 125.96 B: and uh normally they've been outdoor cats but i've been stuck in this apartment for three months 'cause i had to move from where i was 

125.94 126.84 A: (( uh-huh )) 

126.28 131.96 B: and i had a guest house and they were outside and now the cats are inside [mn] very unhappy [mn] 

132.39 139.38 B: uh 'cause they don't belong inside they're outside cats but i live in this apartment complex there's no place for them to go it's too dangerous so 

140.16 141.78 B: [mn] they're stuck right now 

141.91 148.28 B: you know a lot of the places don't rent to people with pets so it's hard to find anything you know it's really 

147.59 149.77 A: oh right 

148.82 161.49 B: that's what i'm going through if you own your own home no problem but when you rent it's terrible it really really is terrible [sigh] so um i spend at least twenty minutes in the morning half hour in the morning 

161.39 166.51 B: really concentrated time with my cats and i take one outside we have a little 

166.70 170.64 B: courtyard thing but i have to hang on to him because if i let him go he'll split 

170.46 172.07 A: yeah oh god 

171.51 175.29 B: and uh see that's the difference between dogs and cats um 

175.39 178.65 B: dogs are more high maintenance got to walk 'em do all this stuff 

178.69 184.75 B: but cats will take off and especially if they're used to being outside that's 

184.57 194.08 B: the normal instinct for them and and dogs are a little bit more happy being an inside animal but cats are not that way you know not really 

190.51 191.46 A: uh-huh 

193.62 194.67 A: oh 

195.05 196.10 B: so 

196.12 199.83 B: it's challenging for my cats to be inside and 

199.90 214.77 B: so i definitely have to spend time with them otherwise they would you know [lipsmack] freak out and i'm not here a lot i work a lot of hours and so when i am here you know then i do have to spend time and hang out with them and not ignore them 'cause i ignore them and they 

211.67 212.74 A: yeah 

215.26 216.18 B: (( they get )) 

215.28 218.19 A: then they get sad and they yeah 

216.30 220.46 B: oh yeah they're just they're going to be it's kind of affects their health 

220.69 224.93 B: definitely there's they're in good health thank goodness but 

225.10 226.73 B: you know if you don't 

226.78 230.05 B: you know they d- our pets depend on us just how it is 

229.09 230.44 A: exactly 

230.52 233.93 B: you know we got to we got to be there for them you know 

234.54 235.49 A: yeah 

234.64 235.61 B: (( [mn] so )) 

236.08 237.12 B: wow 

236.31 238.55 A: because they know when we're um 

239.00 241.48 A: when we're sensing something 

240.88 243.68 B: oh yeah they tune right in 

243.72 247.32 B: you know absolutely and [sigh] dogs 

247.36 248.92 B: (( you know hah )) 

249.07 251.95 B: i don't know if you know is this the first dog you've ever had [noise] 

251.41 254.32 A: [sigh] no he's like my second one 

254.21 255.33 B: okay 

255.42 260.04 B: well my father i grew up in long beach my father was the veterinarian 

260.07 266.63 B: [lipsmack] and i grew up with animals all my life so i know them pretty well bit more than the average person would and um 

263.11 264.05 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

267.82 272.81 B: [mn] what he told me he made total sense on the psychology of dogs and cats and the difference 

273.17 279.21 B: the difference is that dogs don't recognize that we're 

279.30 283.69 B: uh like a different species in a sense 

283.74 294.58 B: they look at us as a as a super dog imagine imagine if there was a jesus or a messiah or uh some human being that was god too you know 

286.55 287.44 A: huh 

294.13 295.37 A: oh yeah 

294.75 297.66 B: and and you were with that person you would like 

298.24 300.05 B: [mn] yes master yes master 

298.97 299.97 A: [mn] 

300.21 312.63 B: [mn] you know anything master how can i serve you master anything just tell me just rub my tummy and feed me and i'll do anything for you [sigh] they don't look at us as see they we're super dogs to them [mn] cats 

301.39 302.10 A: (( yeah )) 

307.52 308.70 A: right 

312.64 316.92 B: psychologically know we're a different animal and a different species 

316.80 321.67 B: um and that's why i love cats so much because they love you 

321.54 334.01 B: and if they're not in the mood and you try and pat 'em they'll hiss at you or say fuck off because you know that's they're really independent and then [sigh] they can be loving so they they have their own space but they recognize that we're different [mn] 

334.21 340.72 B: doesn't mean they don't respect us 'course they respect us but they're we're not a super cat to them but dogs are that's why 

339.47 341.22 A: (( hm )) 

340.71 352.61 B: man's best friend is a dog because dog sees us as as superior form of him [mn] that's why they get that attached and [sigh] that's how that works see you 

343.29 344.41 A: oh 

352.41 353.43 A: huh 

354.06 356.41 B: start thinking about it it makes sense 

356.07 357.30 A: yeah 

357.67 359.83 B: (( [laughter] )) 

359.11 360.09 A: well 

360.53 361.88 A: [mn] never um 

362.08 364.03 A: thought of it like that wow 

364.15 373.11 B: well it's the insight into the animals you see the animal world they think they have emotions like us um i think the average person or 

373.08 386.07 B: society or the media portrays animals as dumb and that's any animal owner knows that's bullshit they're very intelligent animals and far more in tune than people give credit them you know 

385.90 386.87 A: you're right 

386.19 390.80 B: well it's just a dog they don't know oh yeah sh- they know 

391.33 394.21 B: i talk to my cats they understand me 

394.58 402.68 B: i know they understand me they can't answer back in english doesn't matter but they know that i'm talking to 'em and they get the message 

398.46 399.41 A: right 

403.26 404.89 B: they get the message 

404.96 406.72 B: they know okay 

405.27 406.53 A: right 

406.58 407.37 A: okay 

407.12 411.96 B: so they may have an animal brain but don't mean they don't have intelligence 

409.57 410.70 A: yeah 

412.91 414.27 A: (( okay i get you )) 

415.26 417.08 B: (( [laughter] ))

480.11 482.37 B: yeah yeah really important 

482.38 495.51 B: uh first thing in the morning if you were in around in the afternoon it would be great but at least when you get home at night you got to take him for a walk at night [mn] basically the smart thing is take him out before you guys go to sleep you know [mn]

502.98 508.55 B: so it's healthy but they've got to relieve themselves and they've got to 

508.56 518.35 B: get into that pattern that they already know that they can do that if they're especially if they're inside [sigh] you know if you have a yard and i don't know if you do and they're outside all the time that's one thing 

518.53 521.90 B: but if they're inside waiting for you yeah you gotta [noise]
