9.66 10.40 A: (( so )) 

12.54 17.64 A: the topic is where do you draw the line between like foul humor and clean humor 

18.01 19.93 B: oh okay 

18.94 20.79 A: i don't really have a line 

20.92 28.70 B: mm no i i'd say no it's uh one's about as good as the other i believe [mn] all of it can be in good taste or bad i reckon i'm not sure 

23.86 24.89 A: uh 

28.56 32.72 A: yeah uh do we have to talk about comedy or can we just talk about whatever we want 

29.46 30.29 B: (( [mn] )) 

32.72 36.72 B: uh well i this is only the third time i've done this and the first time i had uh 

36.74 43.35 B: bioterrorism god i didn't know what to say we all we all just sort of just i think it was the quietest ten minutes i'd ever seen but 

39.00 40.39 A: yeah 

42.23 45.00 A: [laughter] well let's just talk about whatever then 

44.62 46.85 B: yeah well that was a i don't 

47.73 60.85 B: comedy in general i reckon i don't know i like all kinds i like most of the main people i've watched or listened to's dead though i mean i like [mn] i don't guess they would really like hearing who i liked i like sam kennison and chris farley and uh john candy and rodney dangerfield i mean all of 

49.73 51.36 A: (( i don't know i mean )) 

58.15 59.69 A: oh yeah 

60.71 63.52 A: yeah i just watched tommy boy the other day got a little 

61.55 62.18 B: (( 'em )) 

62.38 64.41 B: oh that's pretty cool i like all of his 

64.39 65.42 A: yeah 

64.99 71.55 B: i don't really um i'm like you i don't know i don't really draw no line i mean it's just there's some more vulgar than others but you know 

69.08 70.50 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

72.69 77.59 B: but that that goes with anybody andrew clay he's pretty rough i mean but i like him 

77.60 79.64 A: uh i don't know i don't really 

77.81 87.87 B: [mn] you don't have to really i mean i like like some of the stuff i don't really i don't hate 'em because they come out with some of sam kennison's stuff is pretty rough but i mean i just take it in stride i didn't 

80.88 82.95 A: yeah he's been again 

85.22 86.60 A: yeah 

88.25 89.67 B: you know think much about 

88.64 91.65 A: yeah you can't get upset about it 'cause you know they're just trying to 

91.78 95.61 A: you know it doesn't appeal to everybody it doesn't mean it's in foul taste you know 

92.20 93.70 B: (( it )) 

95.56 101.39 B: yeah [mn] is that what is that mainly what that question was well if you draw the line or something between good and bad 

99.91 103.67 A: yeah so i don't draw a line so 

101.53 107.26 B: (( or something oh well it's sort of depending on either you like it or you don't i'm not really sure )) 

106.11 107.08 A: yeah 

107.42 116.85 B: but i like all kinds of 'em [mn] i'm sure the ones i like like i say they probably wouldn't they would definitely draw the line i'd say because of over the age or something like that i'm not sure 

116.77 117.66 A: yeah 

116.78 128.69 B: how would rate 'em oh yeah with south park [mn] shut up you don't even like it [noise] [laughter] that's pretty cool [noise] but uh yeah there ain't no line drawn on south park you ever seen that 

121.13 121.85 A: [laughter] 

128.05 129.56 A: oh yeah lots of times 

129.47 139.47 B: [laughter] yeah 

129.61 137.70 A: oh yeah well i guess that's probably about to crossing the line as you can get did you see the one where christopher reeves is like eating baby fetuses for stem cells and stuff like that 

138.10 141.84 A: that's about as far as you can get i'd say without like 

142.49 146.55 A: i don't know the show really pushes it to the edge but i don't have a problem with it or anything like that 

145.54 159.49 B: no i well the fact is if if if they're playing something you don't like it's why they have more than one channel i mean [mn] turning it to a different another station don't go on those spree and try to ban it from the whole world i mean there might be more people like it and you can always change your channel but 

150.72 151.83 A: yes exact- 

156.88 158.12 A: yeah 

159.44 172.65 B: [mn] it's so simple but that i [mn] but then them dudes are they don't [mn] they go pretty good yeah they push it about as far as they can go i was watching it a couple of weeks ago and it was really i had never seen that before it was so different 

159.90 161.64 A: yeah exactly 

166.99 167.93 A: yeah 

172.27 174.46 A: [laughter] 

172.90 179.29 B: [laughter] it was pretty good pretty wild we had well we stopped and watched it i mean we always sit and watched it for ten or fifteen minutes 

177.07 178.07 A: yeah 

178.20 181.23 A: i mean it's just something new you know like 

180.22 191.95 B: yeah you don't have to [mn] my god i mean if they somebody in the head with a bottle or something don't mean i want to run outside and start swinging at people and that my god you're just gonna watch it and gotta have some sense anyway about it but i don't know 

186.21 187.09 A: yeah 

192.78 195.07 B: you ever done this stuff before 

194.68 196.53 A: uh yeah once already 

197.53 203.69 A: but uh the person kind a like quit talking like after a couple of minutes and i didn't really know what to do so 

197.74 199.20 B: [mn] 

199.22 199.78 B: (( [cough] )) 

202.94 211.82 B: yeah my first call my third one but my first one was a boy i mean he didn't say three sentences but i didn't really know what to say either it you know bioterrorism and stuff 

210.06 212.39 A: how did you uh how did you find about this 

212.67 224.78 B: oh i oh my girlfriend here stays online all the time and and she she's done 'em and they said they was having trouble getting men or something they needed men to do it and and i don't like i said i'd never done it 

216.36 217.44 A: oh really 

220.09 220.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

221.19 222.15 A: (( oh )) 

222.31 223.79 A: 'cause i just saw it on the web- 

224.15 229.84 A: i saw it on a website i didn't know if it was like a scam or something at first 'cause you gotta give like your like social security number and everything 

229.35 237.89 B: no they do pay she she can tell you they they give it they ten dollars for like ten minutes or something you can do it three times or something [noise] 

232.11 233.44 A: yeah 

235.11 236.24 A: yeah 

237.14 239.11 A: i know i'm not gonna complain about that 

238.52 242.25 B: no i'll do it i like the phone i can talk and gab all with the best of 'em i reckon 

241.97 243.04 A: oh yeah 

242.31 251.30 B: but uh [mn] but uh i like i say as far as that topic goes i don't really know what you would say [mn] so luckily i'm a bit like you on that once you say that well where do you go from there i don't really [mn] 

247.03 248.18 A: yeah 

250.61 252.08 A: i have no idea 

252.45 263.09 B: (( [noise] well we'll talk they don't draw no line and stuff how do you [noise] yeah )) 

255.08 256.42 A: i think it really just 

256.83 262.00 A: they just want to give you something to get you talking i mean they don't really care what we think about comedy you know but 

263.40 264.81 A: (( [laughter] )) 

263.56 275.41 B: [noise] i mean uh yeah that's that there's so many sides to that question i mean what somebody likes [mn] somebody ain't gonna like something everybody's not [mn] gonna like the same stuff so there'd there'd be so many lines drawed on each you couldn't even see it if you's gonna do that 

269.78 270.70 A: i know 

271.27 272.34 A: (( yeah )) 

275.16 276.10 A: yeah 

275.43 285.95 B: i i just say if you like it watch it if you don't just turn it [mn] somebody else might not like it well they might like it or might not but [mn] it don't matter you don't mean you gotta live with it or nothing just if you don't enjoy it turn it so simple 

280.96 281.79 A: yeah 

287.25 302.04 B: [noise] well yeah kids don't need to watch i don't know what what age would you say kids should be to watch south park that's pretty interesting [laughter] yeah yeah some of them i mean some eight nine year old they don't really it would really it's 

293.20 297.70 A: i don't know it all depends on the kid because not all thirteen year old kids are the same you know 

301.46 305.91 A: well personal i don't think they'd get half the jokes anyway [mn] i 

304.09 310.99 B: yeah yeah but i like it where it [mn] yeah i agree there they're not gonna understand but i don't know that one i don't uh [mn] 

311.48 314.97 A: don't know if i had kids chances are i wouldn't let them watch it 

311.64 316.59 B: [laughter] yeah yeah she's uh my girlfriend's thirty three and she's too young for south park 

316.43 318.42 A: [laughter] 

316.90 318.99 B: (( [laughter] she's )) 

319.13 331.95 B: just just kills her but we always have to stop everytime we go by we'll stop [mn] like i say there's no lines drawed there but i can enjoy it i can watch it and enjoy it and i don't you don't go round pushing it on people but i'm pretty sure but yeah they might watch that but i don't like when they 

323.25 324.17 A: yeah 

326.70 327.72 A: yeah 

332.15 337.16 B: [mn] they start drawing lines and telling what people they can and can't watch [mn] i think that's about 

333.88 334.95 A: yeah 

335.58 338.97 A: you can't tell people what they can and can't watch anyway 

337.55 341.02 B: no that's worse than what they could show i mean [mn] 

339.92 341.11 A: exactly 

341.64 342.54 B: (( i don't know )) 

342.75 357.21 B: they got a bunch of these you know like ren and [laughter] stimpy and all that stuff coming on i used to watch some of them they're all uh adult or [mn] or for grown ups now yeah that's beavis and butthead used to be wild but now they're just sort 

345.82 346.87 A: oh yeah 

350.14 354.70 A: but now you watch ren and stimpy and it's like pretty tame you know like compared with what they got now 

356.81 357.94 A: yeah 

357.44 366.77 B: a i don't know [noise] yeah uh but i mean i don't believe they should do that either but that that goes i guess about drawing the line i mean you can watch something 

359.98 360.54 A: (( [mn] )) 

366.53 379.48 B: okay somebody might like when beavis and butthead did the fire and stuff like that okay people might go out and start fires and burn theirself say and what what what do you draw the where do they draw the line at i mean uh you can't let [mn] they didn't make 'em go do it i don't understand that 

369.25 370.27 A: (( mhm )) 

371.67 375.52 A: yeah but i don't think that's the show's fault 

375.60 376.69 A: yeah 

378.21 379.95 A: no not at all 

380.55 384.53 A: but i mean you turn on the news and there's arson and that and stuff like that you know 

384.07 386.79 B: well got to put it on something 

386.66 387.91 A: yeah 

387.27 401.03 B: i know you know i'm not gonna say if them watching it all the time it might not make 'em want to do it or something like that but [mn] i think it comes with the person the individual too firstly they they going to go setting nothing on fire 'cause somebody on t._v. does [mn] i don't i don't think anyway i may be wrong you don't know 

395.63 396.96 A: yeah 

398.19 399.33 A: yeah 

400.53 404.99 A: i don't know well it's kind of a problem with jackass 'cause kids see these guys doing something 

404.53 407.02 B: oh jesus do you like that 

406.49 408.70 A: i love jackass but i mean 

407.98 410.18 B: [laughter] yeah we love it but 

409.91 419.10 A: i know that i'm not i shouldn't go uh i mean we do do a lot of stupid stuff l- like jackass you know but when we when we get hurt we know it was our own fault for being stupid we don't try and 

410.13 418.40 B: jackass yeah 

418.35 429.24 B: that's that's just some days it's pretty wild [mn] they do some wild stuff but i mean i i watch 'em do it and i love to watch it but i don't i don't want to try it but i mean i ain't gonna staple stuff to me and 

419.23 420.63 A: blame it on t._v. 

422.00 422.88 A: i mean 

423.10 424.25 A: just the other week 

425.31 426.73 A: oh yeah 

427.65 428.79 A: uh-huh 

429.17 440.30 B: you know the stuff that they do it's really that movie when it come i loved it i laughed so hard but the but i'm glad they don't draw no lines on stuff like that because there is some of us out here that [laughter] do enjoy watching it so 

433.21 434.83 A: oh yeah 

439.40 440.90 A: i i know 

440.61 450.40 B: and i don't think i'm twisted or crazy but i just love it i sit there and laugh at it and i don't know i'm not gonna go kill nobody when the movie's over i just want to sit there and laugh and enjoy it and [mn] just go home when it goes off 

444.99 445.85 A: yeah 

446.58 447.65 A: [laughter] 

450.15 450.98 A: (( yeah yep )) 

450.53 452.72 B: but it is killer though [cough] 

452.22 453.38 A: oh yeah 

455.50 456.59 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

457.29 460.93 B: yeah you seen that mov- the jackass movie was pretty cool and 

460.57 463.11 A: yeah i bought that like right after it came out 

461.84 463.48 B: that was so pretty great 

463.35 465.47 A: you like uh you seen old school yet 

465.39 468.73 B: no they was telling me about it at work and i i- is it pretty cool 

467.71 470.78 A: oh that movie that movie kills me it's so funny [laughter] 

470.56 473.92 B: (( really oh the old school with uh we're always talking about seeing no )) 

473.97 476.14 B: (( somebody was telling me at work about it and i )) 

476.02 490.27 B: like i say i- if they draw the lines like i guess this question i'm i keep going back to this so they just won't hang up on us and we'll get the money so [laughter] but uh but if if they draw the lines hell we wouldn't be able to see half the jackass you'd never see that you'd never see you'd never see south park that'd be the they'd take it right off 

481.76 483.08 A: (( yeah )) 

486.55 487.76 A: oh i know 

489.05 495.32 A: oh no definitely not 'cause i mean what are they're supposed to be like seven year old kids or something on south park you know 

495.30 501.62 B: yeah but i think when they finally went up a grade they're in the fourth grade now they was in the third grade for like my god ten [mn] years 

498.49 500.32 A: oh yeah 

501.81 502.85 B: but uh 

502.43 502.99 A: (( [mn] )) 

503.29 509.53 B: [mn] yeah i- it's just i think most people got a little more sense and they get credit for 'em you know i love to watch it but i don't 

507.82 508.82 A: yeah 

510.21 511.55 A: i think most of 

510.40 512.60 B: [mn] i i ain't gonna go do the stuff that they do 

511.91 519.43 A: yeah most of the people in america are not retarded you know they can figure out when to do stuff and when not to do stuff 

518.44 531.59 B: well you w- we hear the way they talk to you and they send you letters and it's it's like you're more than retarded it's like you ain't got no sense at all i mean we ain't the smartest in the world but we ain't crazy either i mean lord but uh 

525.00 526.42 A: yeah 

528.47 530.19 A: [laughter] 

531.53 544.79 B: i don't think they should uh draw the line and tell people what they should and can't watch i mean i don't i don't care how bad it is and i i mean i might hate it and i might hate it with all my heart but if somebody else might want to watch it hell th- they should be able to and i know they have some wild stuff on 

534.40 536.37 A: oh i know they should 

537.06 539.29 A: yeah they should never ever do that 

541.61 542.50 A: yeah 

542.62 544.09 A: no i don't necessarily think 

544.76 549.06 A: they should make sure that they put it on like not during the middle of the day when little kids are home watching 

544.88 547.46 B: (( yeah )) 

547.94 550.30 B: (( yeah that's right put in )) 

549.67 552.32 A: but that's why south park's not even on 'til ten o'clock 

551.81 565.08 B: the no and then it's the par- and that's like the parents gotta take some responsibility there too i mean if they can't they can't say whether they're sneaking around watching it well if they're sneaking around doing that then they can be sneaking around doing anything if you ain't gonna have no control over 'em i mean they're pretty good they're pretty sneaky 

555.45 556.72 A: exactly 

558.25 559.28 A: yeah 

561.39 562.52 A: [laughter] 

562.72 563.71 A: i know 

565.10 571.02 B: but uh you can be a little sneakier an older person can be just a little sneakier and that but uh 

566.98 568.27 A: (( [laughter] )) 

571.02 580.04 B: [mn] they went uh like i said my girlfriend took her kids in to see south park she'd never seen it never seen it at all she'd never watched it one time she thought it was cartoon movie 

575.77 576.83 A: oh really 

578.21 579.27 A: oh wow 

579.97 581.43 A: [laughter] 

580.02 587.27 B: they went in and she had she walked out she didn't stay five minutes it was just like they hadn't even got through singing the first song when it come on 

587.25 588.33 A: (( that's a laugh )) 

587.40 595.53 B: yeah the erkle song there the first of it and she didn't she had to pack up and leave [noise] she won't even watch it hardly here in the house but i've got her watching it a little bit 

592.82 594.36 A: [laughter] 

595.58 598.13 B: but uh like i say as as far as drawing line 

598.79 599.67 B: (( to go ))
