31.38 33.93 A: oh really so i'm guessing you're rooting for the spurs 

34.12 38.90 B: yeah i wanted the spurs to win i didn't think byron scott's a very good coach anyway 

39.67 47.50 A: i i could see that coming especially since he got like two or three technicals against himself throughout the series it's pretty 

46.56 52.04 B: yeah i don't i don't think he's a very good coach he should have put mutombo one on one against um [lipsmack] 

52.20 56.87 B: one on one against duncan and not doubled down on him 'cause that's why they got killed the whole series 

56.93 63.26 A: that's true the i i could understand not putting him in the entire time especially since 

63.33 64.69 A: he really has v- 

64.97 71.98 A: very little offensive talent [lipsmack] so couldn't really put him in like for for every game or 

72.35 78.02 A: or for much time even though when he did put him in he you're right he shouldn't have doubled him up 

77.78 79.44 B: (( [noise] yeah oh yeah )) 

79.75 82.75 B: i have to agree what other sports do you watch [noise]

138.69 141.46 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] that's all right though you guys have got basketball )) 

141.60 144.95 A: yeah that's true although um they were 

145.49 147.74 A: pretty sad [sigh] um 

148.49 150.89 A: in the tournament also for that matter 

150.90 157.41 B: [noise] yeah well uh what's with onyekwe wasn't he supposed to go pro or w- is he going to get drafted or not 

157.09 159.79 A: uh i think that he was uh 

160.63 172.86 A: supposed to but i didn't really follow the draft all that well um i don't think uh i i don't think he's going to get dra- i don't think he got drafted i think he's probably um 

174.51 179.88 A: going but he's probably just going to end up um like having to try out for a team afterwards 

179.54 182.59 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well they didn't have the draft yet did they for the n._b._a. [noise] 

182.88 184.12 A: (( um )) 

186.00 190.09 A: no no they didn't wait no uh no actually 

187.42 188.73 B: (( yeah i suppose [noise] )) 

190.27 191.44 A: uh 

191.86 193.94 A: uh yeah when do they have it actually do 

194.02 194.93 B: (( oh uh )) 

194.12 195.68 A: they have it in the fall 

196.24 198.69 B: uh i'm not sure when it is to be honest with you 

199.29 200.39 A: um 

199.74 201.59 B: uh-huh not too sure 

201.61 203.53 B: (( but [noise] )) 

202.79 207.36 A: you know you know you know what they did uh i i think they they did um 

207.85 217.36 A: i think it's soon because i think they did a draft uh i think they did the lottery to find out who chooses first 

216.89 218.52 B: yeah yeah 

217.75 218.75 A: um 

218.89 220.79 A: wait hold on a sec yeah what's up 

222.20 222.91 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

223.02 225.87 A: uh tell her i'll call her back in a few minutes 

227.00 241.76 A: sorry um yeah so uh uh uh because i think i remember hearing uh i'm like mildly a knicks fan and i think i remember hearing that they had like uh a small chance of getting um 

235.36 236.51 B: (( [noise] [noise] okay [noise] )) 

242.07 250.12 A: like a a relatively uh like like a i don't know seven percent chance of getting um like 

250.19 254.36 A: fir- first through third pick or something like that and that was like a couple of weeks ago 

252.87 254.42 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

254.94 264.65 A: so i think i think a couple of weekends ago they decided on uh they did the lottery for who gets what picks er but they haven't done the the actual draft yet 

255.00 256.29 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

263.92 268.19 B: [noise] [noise] so how so how are you mildly a a knicks fan how does that work [noise] 

267.69 271.23 A: well i was a big knicks fan um 

271.70 278.41 A: years ago um when they were good but uh after watching them lose 

278.43 280.19 A: so many uh 

278.62 279.44 B: [laughter] 

280.58 291.60 A: so many championship games uh and after watching the bulls crush them in so many series it just got a little bit tiring uh watching them so um 

283.41 284.70 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

286.14 288.29 B: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

291.70 295.78 A: like now i'll watch them eh whenever i have the time but i don't really follow 

295.94 296.98 A: uh 

297.16 301.06 A: i don't really follow them that much but um not to mention 

301.30 308.03 A: uh during the winter uh for some reason i just i tend not to have much time to watch uh watch t._v. so it's a lot more difficult 

308.32 309.30 B: (( i hear ya [noise] they're )) 

309.34 312.31 A: to watch my team plus i mean i don't even know 

312.38 314.67 A: when they're gonna be good it's like uh 

314.77 316.26 A: uh every year 

316.32 322.60 A: they get a new player and he'll get injured in in preseason so it's kind of a waste of time 

322.26 326.39 B: they're talking about trading sprewell to the sixers for van horn [noise] 

327.88 329.37 A: are you serious 

328.83 331.39 B: yeah they're talking about trading uh 

331.82 335.18 B: they they want van horn for some reason i don't understand why 

335.09 338.36 A: i don't know either i mean 

338.33 339.55 B: (( [laughter] )) 

339.06 343.96 A: sprewell hasn't been doing great but i mean he stills puts up pretty good numbers and 

343.98 346.40 A: uh who are they gonna have in sprewell's place 

344.03 345.14 B: he's a lot better now 

346.45 356.81 B: but i don't know it's that's it's a good question i don't i don't see why new york would want to do that but if i'm i'm the sixers i'd do it in a heartbeat i 

355.99 357.18 A: yeah that's true 

356.93 365.26 B: i i hate latrelle sprewell i'm not a big fan of him at all but uh [laughter] you know uh uh it's a good trade is a good trade [laughter] 

364.65 368.17 A: yeah i know that's definitely true not to mention i mean 

366.47 367.32 B: (( yeah )) 

369.52 372.15 A: [sigh] he's got uh er he can uh 

372.34 376.29 A: he can be a a second really big score on the team 

375.95 377.49 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

376.78 387.95 A: and uh the- they're definitely missing something right now i mean they're not they're not exactly going to be winning a championship any time soon unless they make some changes i heard um 

388.25 393.82 A: do you know if uh speaking of basketball [noise] do you know if jeff van gundy decided on um 

394.27 396.14 A: [noise] coaching a team 

395.95 402.01 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] not yet but they said that because he hadn't decided yet it looks like he's gonna end up just um 

402.54 404.46 B: just broadcasting 

404.45 405.57 A: oh really 

405.33 406.87 B: yeah 'cause they think it 

405.93 409.04 A: 'cause i saw i saw some picture um 

409.66 413.92 A: uh in the newspaper or maybe not the newspaper maybe it was on t._v. um 

414.18 415.16 A: uh 

415.59 423.83 A: him like with a a rockets hat on or something like that but i didn't see i didn't see like the caption or anything like that so i 

423.46 425.26 B: (( oh i don't know i think )) 

424.14 426.98 A: thought that maybe he had decided to go somewhere 

426.73 431.18 B: no i didn't see that that was another trade there talking about doing eric snow 

431.40 433.50 B: (( to the rockets for eddie griffin )) 

434.11 435.27 A: really 

435.03 436.71 B: yeah and uh 

437.13 441.29 B: mm and that in the sixers will pick up eddie griffin 

441.21 452.58 B: and then if they traded van horn for sprewell let sprewell into the one sprewell to two griffin into three and then kenny thomas and barry coleman into four and five 

452.62 454.87 A: it'd be a pretty interesting thing to watch 

454.57 455.80 B: [laughter] 

455.63 460.48 A: [laughter] that'd definitely be a wh- what's up 

456.96 458.76 B: (( er it definitely will be )) 

459.90 462.15 B: er i agree i said it definitely would be 

462.17 465.64 B: be interesting get themselves into a lot of trouble i think 

462.38 463.43 A: yeah 

465.85 466.85 A: um 

467.59 470.38 A: well you think that they need to keep a few more people 

469.99 473.25 B: (( well uh what do you mean if they just )) 

472.68 474.36 A: yeah 

473.95 481.19 B: uh they just got to keep they got to keep the core i think they got to keep snow yeah like snow iverson and uh and thomas 

482.40 484.67 A: (( [noise] why do you think that )) 

483.80 487.67 B: well i think everybody else is expendable coleman goes
