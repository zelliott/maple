38.78 40.39 A: and um 

40.75 52.77 A: [lipsmack] i agree that um compatibility's the number one thing you have to have uh the same interests and or not necessarily the same interests but at least the ability to work with each other 

48.39 49.20 B: (( mm )) 

52.18 54.56 B: oh definitely yeah 

54.10 55.42 A: and the 

56.77 59.41 A: uh wanting to make it work no matter what 

58.77 63.03 B: yes i think you're absolutely right yeah and uh [sigh] 

63.68 76.02 B: oh goodness i don't i don't know what to to say about uh you know uh what to avoid to avoid my [laughter] situation um you know our our divorce is really um 

70.21 73.25 A: [laughter] yeah 

76.55 78.78 B: a result of we had some 

78.80 85.78 B: uh some incredible compatibilities and then we had some incredible conflicts and uh that made for very interesting 

83.25 84.08 A: mhm 

85.96 98.88 B: uh relationship over the eighteen years that we were married um and some extremely high points uh and we worked out a number of ways of living together but at the same time there were some 

89.21 90.30 A: mhm 

99.11 113.73 B: aspects uh to our characters which you know it was a matter of um [sigh] you know well just balancing um being who we were and suppressing who we were so [lipsmack] 

107.53 108.21 A: (( hm )) 

113.02 120.33 A: yeah well that's never good i mean if you can't be uh yourself with your life partner then who can you be yourself with 

118.86 129.23 B: exactly exactly yeah so uh i mean okay the- the- the- these are generalities uh just basically what 

129.20 141.32 B: was the case in petra's and my relationship is that we um we travelled very well together we uh we were very very good we both uh 

132.14 133.72 A: mhm 

136.05 137.22 A: mhm 

141.89 146.57 B: were involved in foreign languages in learning foreign languages 

144.27 145.80 A: mhm 

146.72 160.96 B: uh and we had opportunities to spend extended times time periods abroad and uh we were able to travel with each other and uh do a great deal of exploration the problem came 

153.41 155.53 A: oh that's wonderful 

160.92 164.23 B: was when we had to really 

164.56 169.37 B: [lipsmack] um curtail the travel and work uh 

167.12 168.36 A: mhm 

170.60 174.24 B: [sigh] uh we we shifted to a um 

174.45 176.78 B: a small town where we 

177.23 181.37 B: had difficulty earning livings and where we had to uh 

179.31 180.18 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

181.79 193.87 B: basically um we were deprived of i guess uh the kinds of stimulation that we had been very good at together so perhaps there was some place we simply made a wrong choice 

189.69 191.09 A: (( mhm right )) 

193.50 202.97 A: yeah um i'm currently in a small town myself i moved here from a [sigh] uh bit larger town for a uh teaching position which ended up going belly up 

202.71 210.97 B: oh congratulations oh you know hold the congratulations di- di- did you you move to the small town for a teaching position 

205.87 207.16 A: [laughter] 

209.40 214.88 A: for a teaching position and the teaching position went belly up at the end of the school year 

214.34 215.89 B: oh ouch 

215.50 217.04 A: (( mhm )) 

216.34 218.64 B: oh i that's oh 

218.77 222.71 B: yeah oh small college that folded [sigh] 

222.14 227.47 A: [mn] a small um high school that ended up not having the money to keep me on 

226.78 232.98 B: oh my gosh oh that's too bad uh so you're looking for a new place 

228.86 230.26 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

232.26 236.06 A: mhm new teaching position anyway 

233.07 234.70 B: yeah 

235.45 240.13 B: yeah yeah uh you uh either in in the town you're in or elsewhere 

238.56 239.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

239.49 246.94 A: yeah well relatively in the general area 'cause my uh wife she's finishing up her psychology degree 

240.39 241.36 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

246.35 248.18 B: oh yeah 

248.38 250.84 B: oh well that's good yeah

251.68 254.38 A: you know you're caught in catch twenty two so you're 

254.57 260.68 B: [mn] well yeah yeah but i think you can you can uh you can work through it 

258.48 268.79 A: oh yeah hopefully oh yeah i mean you know it's of c- you know this sort of thing tends to put a little bit of a uh strain on things but you know nothing horrible 

267.33 276.96 B: mhm [sigh] well you know you- you'll be surprised what kinds of things may open up in terms of because you know the two of you together 

276.98 290.40 B: uh w- will probably develop some sort of combined um interests or directions that neither one of you would have necessarily developed by him or herself 

289.69 291.15 A: hm interesting 

290.88 300.49 B: i guess well that that's what that's what happened with with me and petra anyway so um yeah well that's the um 

292.79 293.80 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

297.95 303.73 A: yeah yeah she's uh going int- or she's looking into getting into art therapy 

303.35 309.27 B: [noise] oh that's wonderful what can i ask you what your field is in teaching what 

307.46 310.01 A: history history 

309.43 314.49 B: history oh well okay and our culture certainly needs 

314.74 316.61 B: to be aware of history oh 

315.60 320.64 A: yeah oh definitely i've i've got a um bachelor's degree in history from pitt 

320.34 321.35 B: uh-huh 

321.68 323.70 A: (( so you know i'm )) 

322.33 328.90 B: okay well see i teach literature at a university in uh philadelphia so 

328.28 329.58 A: oh cool 

329.63 335.74 B: [sigh] for me history has been a very important handmaiden to literature 

329.88 332.06 A: i'm down in north carolina right now 

333.79 337.02 A: oh i bet with teaching lit of course it would be 

336.58 342.44 B: yeah [sigh] well you know it's i mean i always regard them as two halves of the same coin 

341.88 348.42 A: oh definitely you can't have [noise] literature without history and you can't have history without literature because they're intertwined 

345.06 346.86 B: yeah 

347.34 361.79 B: [noise] yeah yeah well um so do do you and your uh wife have opportunities to like talk about things at night like mm intellectual academic 

358.51 361.54 A: mhm yeah we uh 

361.76 365.15 A: we uh generally talk about intellectual and academic things 

364.69 366.45 B: mhm 

365.16 379.73 A: and uh you know when we're uh see right now we're between um because you know we just moved here and i've been here a little longer than she has but [noise] um it's a matter of [noise] you know finding compatible people that are 

371.37 373.03 B: yeah 

374.55 375.41 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

379.80 382.14 A: intelligent in a small rural 

382.02 388.79 B: [sigh] [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah we experienced some of that 

382.34 384.57 A: (( town in north carolina )) 

388.00 392.21 A: so you you obviously know what i'm talking about 

390.59 404.96 B: oh yeah well yeah after we got out of graduate school i stuck around for a year uh in our university graduate school town working at odd jobs uh while she wrote her dissertation and then the two of us 

396.17 396.84 A: (( mm )) 

399.07 400.36 A: mhm 

404.98 414.05 B: uh got a job together at a very small college in a very very small town in the greater p. b. swamp region of south carolina 

413.62 415.44 A: (( mhm oh [laughter] )) 

414.01 423.00 B: uh so we we were there for the three years it was it was uh really very interesting but the college was always just on the 

423.03 425.32 B: teetering on the brink of um 

425.33 426.76 B: dissolving 

426.27 428.02 A: (( oh that's not very good mhm )) 

426.89 437.28 B: uh it was it was really very uh it is very unse- insecure place but we [sigh] you know it was it was a real uh powerful experience we uh met 

437.22 447.12 B: people in the local community and um you know we got to know them not just people who were in our little college but there were others as well 

445.16 446.18 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

446.70 447.75 A: oh definitely 

447.29 449.01 B: yeah so 

448.57 458.31 A: it's just a matter of uh you know getting uh to know people and that sort of thing and it's like it- it's rather frustrating in a way 'cause you know i was um 

452.71 453.78 B: yeah 

453.89 455.50 B: (( mhm )) 

456.68 458.39 B: mhm

474.78 486.55 A: well they were pretty much along the lines of well you know we told you it it was one of those i was hired for a position they said you know there might be teaching summer school there most likely will be a position in the fall 

485.93 487.09 B: yeah

584.81 587.47 B: oh okay yeah well okay 

586.61 591.12 A: well i don't think it really matters it but as long as we're con- conversing i
