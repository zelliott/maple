4.31 5.38 A: (( how're doing greg )) 

5.07 6.56 B: pretty good 

5.87 12.98 A: good good um i guess we're supposed to start with what is our favorite sport to watch on t._v. 

12.73 13.75 B: yeah 

13.52 14.62 A: okay 

14.63 17.10 A: um i guess i'll go [laughter] first 

16.61 17.52 B: okay 

17.25 19.87 A: um football 

20.33 30.79 A: and probably uh i guess to be more specific college football at this point um is probably what i'd rather watch more than anything else 

25.90 26.94 B: yeah 

30.77 40.98 A: but um just football in general would be the favorite um i watch just about anybody run into each other [laughter] as they sort of all 

31.67 32.62 B: and 

39.56 40.79 B: (( yeah do )) 

42.40 45.21 B: you watch any other sports 

44.83 46.56 A: i will watch 

48.11 52.50 A: [mn] [sigh] i do um you know i watched a lot of the n._b._a. finals 

52.66 56.58 A: this pay- you know i watched a lot of the playoffs for them i i don't watch hockey 

56.71 60.60 A: um i grew up in miami and just never really gotten into hockey 

60.79 67.39 A: um and and i like the whole m._c._a. basketball tournament you know the march madness deal 

67.63 68.96 A: um 

69.64 76.20 A: but i i'll watch the yankees when it comes to baseball that's about it um 

77.10 79.36 A: [lipsmack] and that's 

79.99 86.75 A: don't watch nearly as much as i used to let's put it that way you know when i was younger i was a teenager i you know 

85.32 86.09 B: (( right yeah )) 

87.10 90.17 A: spent half my days watching sports now 

90.77 102.27 A: now that i've gotten older and you know have more to do and i guess you get more and more you know annoyed and frustrated by you know how these people act and all the stuff they do 

102.50 103.52 B: yeah and how much 

102.93 104.71 A: i've watched less and less 

104.42 106.37 B: how much they get paid [laughter] 

106.36 108.30 A: ah i'm sorry 

107.11 108.87 B: and how much they get paid 

108.48 111.61 A: uh how much they get paid their attitudes i just e- 

111.79 118.20 A: i guess when you're younger you don't necessarily have to be able to relate to 'em to watch it but as you get older you 

118.04 129.08 A: know you just can't even really in any way shape or form there's just their attitudes it's just you know it just doesn't i don't know doesn't appeal to me a lot thats why i say college football even more than pro because 

129.35 135.83 A: you know they're not getting paid and they they they play because they want to play it seems like 

134.55 142.39 B: no any more then it's almost getting to be the same kind of circus than it is with professionals but they aren't getting paid you're correct so that is the one difference 

141.78 147.83 A: well yeah i mean it's certainly not yeah i- it's y- well let's be honest it's it's not 

142.80 144.05 B: and at least they [mn] 

148.26 150.28 A: it's certainly a business 

149.68 150.92 B: yeah 

150.44 152.53 A: (( you know um )) 

152.50 166.60 A: but you know the the whole environment you know when you watch the games on t._v. the fan the fans are a lot more into it and a lot more vested 'cause they have that that allegiance with their you know i'm a modder or 

163.11 164.16 B: yeah sure 

166.62 167.86 A: you know use this is 

168.71 173.47 A: [mn] it's just a different kind of thing you know i've actually heard professional athletes 

174.19 177.38 A: (( taking uh professional football players and they d- you know they were asked )) 

177.80 183.92 A: you know how do you compare like college you know their college rivalry to a pro rivalry and they say it's not even a comparison 'cause 

183.96 188.20 A: you get some of the pro fans get into it but it's just you know 

188.78 193.59 A: i- with the college fans it's much more vibrant i guess 

189.77 190.85 B: not even a 

193.30 194.43 B: yeah 

194.68 197.65 A: so how about yourself how much 

197.38 207.59 B: uh i don't know i guess in the beginning today i was how many hours a week i don't spend a whole lot of time watching professional sport i do watch um 

208.64 215.79 B: the professional football you know and it's like the season's shorter i can get like you were saying i can get in do it a little more 

215.19 217.07 A: right 

217.27 220.05 B: don't watch as much college as it 

220.77 235.20 B: but i do enjoy watching the college sports more just like close to the same reasons you were saying and i watch mar- you know the march madness and all that but i don't really follow them as basketball teams either the college or the professional teams throughout the season at all 

228.41 230.25 A: right 

235.02 237.99 B: really but i'll watch it in the end and uh 

238.20 244.18 B: football i've chosen pittsburgh and so i watched the steelers games on sunday and stuff so 

240.16 243.63 A: right um i'm 

243.80 250.41 A: big steeler fan that that's what i was about to say if it if it's a steeler game i'll basically tune in 

247.74 248.31 B: (( [cough] )) 

250.20 251.26 B: yeah 

250.76 262.84 A: no matter what you but i find myself even sometimes with pro football unless it's a steel- like if it's a steeler game i have to watch it but especially 'cause you know i live in or- in the i live in the orlando area so 

252.61 253.40 B: (( yeah no )) 

262.99 265.12 A: you know you get 'em every sunday 

265.18 271.90 A: whereas here we get 'em you know when they're on monday might or you know if it's a nationally type televised game 

270.53 271.99 B: televised yeah 

271.87 282.00 A: so i'll always watch those but if i watched a lot of college football on saturday then there's plenty of sundays when i don't even watch football unless you know i'm just flipping through the channels for a little bit here and there but i 

282.39 288.97 A: i find it hard you know i've got kids and all that it's i find it hard [laughter] to spend the whole entire weekend 

288.02 292.33 B: right oh yeah it's like if i watch that that's about it for the weekend 

291.03 300.61 A: yeah and i can't invest i'm a i'm a big miami hurricanes fan so every saturday during football season if they're on i'm watching it so 

292.53 293.15 B: yeah 

300.88 306.66 A: you know if i spend twelve hours during the weekend watching football it gets kind of ridiculous then 

306.76 311.55 A: i can't even blame my wife when she's like come on you know can can we do something else here 

312.01 316.17 B: yeah that's true i i i don't probably watch much of anything else i really don't 

312.03 313.09 A: so 

316.37 324.35 B: follow hockey all that much didn't do anything with the stanley cup playoff this year i didn't watch it any of those games [laughter] 

323.26 328.09 A: no i didn't watch i don't even think i watched one minute of it really 

326.54 333.30 B: no i didn't really get into it this year at all or really that often if the pingers were in the playoffs then i 

333.75 335.40 B: watch a little more 

335.77 336.79 A: (( i i )) 

335.90 337.67 B: (( and yeah )) 

336.61 343.23 A: have seen 'em that way you know when i i like i seen a little bit of miami in in fort lauder area and 

343.24 357.21 A: when the florida panthers made their stanley cup run 'bout six years ago five years ago something like that that is probably one of the more exciting playoff formats if it's your you know if you have an interest in it 

355.23 359.58 B: yeah if you have an interest it it does get very exciting very 

358.43 364.46 A: oh i i mean i don't even care but i was watching every single game you know as they went through the playoffs because 

361.84 363.31 B: (( interesting yeah )) 

364.47 376.35 A: it's just so [mn] for them fo- whatever team wins the stanley cup i mean i think they earn it more than any other team that wins a uh championship if you will 

371.70 372.48 B: oh 

375.68 378.32 B: (( yeah they're just battered by that time they're )) 

377.04 381.14 A: oh i i mean and it's just you know grueling you know 

380.49 381.12 B: (( really )) 

380.93 392.77 A: sixty minutes and then they always seem to almost go to seven games every time and it's just uh it it and i guess you know it you know maybe that's why in other countries they like soccer so much is 

392.95 407.43 A: y- yo- you're so in to it and you're talking about a one goal difference usually in a game you know it's not like you know football or basketball where there's constant scoring so it's so exciting when there is a goal you know i remember i you're literally jumping off your couch 

396.67 397.31 B: yeah 

407.90 410.69 A: you know it it's just a totally uh 

411.33 415.15 A: that i do i did notice that i mean i 

415.45 422.76 A: besides you know a- again if you know the hurricanes are playing the national championship or the steelers are in super bowl that was th- 

419.91 421.05 B: (( yeah right right yeah )) 

422.99 424.35 B: (( that would be a draw )) 

423.03 429.98 A: probably the most exciting sports championship type series i got into was when the panthers made their 

430.09 431.50 A: stanley cup run 

431.81 436.60 B: yeah i find it hard to watch baseball for the season also it's a long season and uh 

436.06 439.75 A: oh absolutely 

437.81 444.45 B: it just seems like it just goes on and on [mn] and i think again that proli- prolif- 

440.98 442.93 A: yeah 

444.97 452.79 B: proliferation of all the teams and just expansions of of all these markets i don't know it's kind of like yeah yeah 

452.93 455.04 A: yeah and i 

455.20 459.63 A: and i'm a yankee fan so like i said i'll watch a yankee and even every now and then 

459.56 470.76 A: but for the m- i won't even watch the whole thing i mean i can't i can never sit through a nine inning baseball game to me it just seems like it it takes too long and the pace is so slow 

467.63 468.66 B: scorcher [laughter] 

470.97 481.57 A: um you know my old man he he's an old you know one of those old time baseball guys he'll sit there and get in for all the nuances and you know he he won't miss a pitch 

473.02 473.59 B: (( yeah )) 

481.73 483.90 A: but i couldn't you know 

484.25 487.19 A: i don't know if that's a generational thing or what but 

486.52 490.62 B: i think it is and and i think baseball's suffering because of that 

487.61 488.17 A: (( [mn] )) 

489.54 494.74 A: i think baseball's going to have huge problems in the next five ten years 

492.42 493.20 B: yeah 

494.42 507.19 B: yeah maybe it'll skip a generation i don't know but [laughter] we've gone through all the baseball strikes and everything else and each generation that was america's game you know and it was like that's about all you had to watch too i mean that was it 

501.57 504.45 A: (( yeah )) 

505.74 508.62 A: right right 

507.02 515.68 B: now there's so much competing and they haven't changed they haven't you know and like you said those guys the baseball players are just probably some of the 

515.71 518.02 B: more arrogant of the of the bunch yeah yeah yeah 

517.18 523.48 A: yeah it's just 'cause i don't know i i i it doesn't do it for me i couldn't really care less what happens over your 

523.34 536.89 A: with baseball but basically a lot of the sports you know and i aside from professional football they're all hurting as far as ratings and you know people are sorting more options and people are getting turned off i think more and more 

536.92 538.50 A: by 

538.52 545.59 A: you know the the price of you you can't a free agency all all of the variety of things 

540.79 542.16 B: oh yeah 

542.49 543.15 B: (( [mn] )) 

545.19 548.13 B: well even to go to the penguins games it's like 

548.45 556.47 B: you know they're begging people to go now but if you want to sit in the rows not even on the grass but just a little ways back it's like seventy five bucks a seat 

556.18 557.56 A: right 

556.82 559.68 B: take four people to that it's three hundred bucks 

559.15 567.11 A: and that's not even including getting beers and parking and hotdogs and all that kind of garbage i mean it's it's a lot of money 

561.21 562.22 B: (( yeah )) 

562.88 563.98 B: exactly 

566.40 568.20 B: well it's become a corporate 

568.23 570.01 B: (( sponsorship not )) 

568.80 577.07 A: well that's what they do that's why they all have to keep building new arenas is 'cause they have to have the corporate seats and th- the boxes and all that kind of junk 

575.59 583.31 B: a family game any more i is basketball suffering like baseball and hockey haven't really followed it they are they still filling it up 

581.70 589.56 A: well i know the ratings this year were horrible and when you read you know about the attendance and the overall ratings every year they seem to be going down 

584.57 585.26 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

589.71 599.95 A: um as th- it's definitely not healthy right now let's put it that way not suffering as much as baseball or hockey i don't think but it's certainly not at it at it's apec-
