50.48 53.97 B: uh what do you feel is the most important thing you look in for a partner 

54.67 62.77 A: [lipsmack] probably somebody that uh really you could just be good friends with because in the long term that's about all you have you know

67.61 71.70 A: yeah someone just to hang out with all the time

72.68 83.09 B: for a boy when he's looking at a partner and for a girl what he what she's looking usually girls are looking for a partner for someone to give them support someone to 

83.37 86.32 B: look up to someone to feel like 

87.05 96.19 B: th- they need someone to to share their life with [mn] more than men need someone to share their life with so so so for a 

93.31 95.14 A: yeah i agree to that sort of 

96.54 103.40 B: man it it's looking just for one thing and for and for a girl it's looking for another thing 

102.34 105.58 A: thing yeah what do you find most important 

105.53 110.45 B: uh i foun- i think the most important thing for for a girl 

110.76 116.81 B: is probably someone they can trust someone they can they know is going to 

117.12 120.78 B: they can depend their life on you know what i mean 

120.57 121.48 A: right 

121.80 123.67 B: that they have someone 

124.29 126.70 B: uh for a man 

126.83 137.03 B: i mean mo- a lot of men when they're looking for a woman you know are looking uh for beauty you know for someone to be good looking uh i believe that is 

132.64 133.97 A: right 

138.21 152.66 B: something you know that that your feelings tells you to look for and i don't think that you can tell them not to look away from that completely but that's not th- th- the most important you need a for one reason you need it 'cause if your wife is not going to be 

145.26 147.67 A: no y- you definitely need a 

153.14 162.06 B: if your wife's looks is n- are not going to be satisfying to you y- you're going to end up either you know messing around with someone else or or you know 

163.02 172.23 B: you gotta make sure you think well if you marry someone that you're satisfied with the way she looks but the most important thing you know in a in a in a wife to look for i believe is more uh 

173.46 181.88 B: you know sh- same thing she should care for you you know home someone that's uh that knows how to you know if if you're 

181.68 191.68 B: [mn] family minded then you want a interested in in bringing up a family that's what you should look in your wife for you know someone that's that's gonna take care of your kids 

188.97 190.80 A: yeah 

191.64 198.92 B: [noise] someone who's gonna take care of the house [noise] uh so when you come home from work you know after a long day at work 

200.52 204.72 B: [mn] there's [noise] there's someone taking care of the house there's someone taking care of your kids 

204.75 207.02 A: right i agree 

207.12 209.20 A: yeah i agree 

207.12 208.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

208.43 222.45 B: uh you know th- this is the way i think that most of the world is th- th- th- the man is the one uh you know bringing the working and bringing the money into the house usually the wife is the one caring for the home you know 

222.78 225.47 B: it's not always that way but uh 

222.86 223.99 A: yeah 

224.26 226.23 A: yeah i think that's pretty much 

226.17 228.24 B: most of the time it is that way 

226.71 232.95 A: was it was the way it used to be i don't think it's so much is any more here in the united states 

233.42 235.22 A: i mean you find a l- 

234.23 244.82 B: what do you think is is the first thing a a a a like when you when you go out with someone people go out and then i don't know dance clubs or bars on the street 

245.04 257.08 B: is looking let's let's not think about what they should be looking for in in a girl or what a girl should be looking for in a man what yeah what is the the the thing that [noise] that would 

251.47 253.18 A: they just look at the girl 

257.03 265.52 B: that would make a man go over a guy go over to the girl and say hi you know i would like to go out with you it's usually if she's attractive so 

261.71 263.75 A: yeah she's got to be attractive 

265.47 277.07 B: even though you know the the the important thing the most important thing is not the attractiveness that's what what triggers usually uh the guy comes over to the girl or the girl going over to the guy 

273.37 275.85 A: yeah that's what initiates everything 

277.13 280.46 A: right yeah i think that's the starting point 

280.13 285.76 B: that's the starting point but then you have to see you know if there's other things there too and uh 

287.06 296.49 B: i believe uh honesty is the first thing you know if if you're going to share your life with someone you gotta make sure the person's an honest person and uh a caring person 

296.56 306.01 B: totally honest and caring and uh and of course being able to uh you know once he's willing to care he has to be able to provide 

306.28 310.74 B: uh provide that care that he would want to give you 

312.18 327.11 B: so i believe it's honesty i mean someone who's who's caring that should be the the the most important things also someone you know you you can a good time with i w- i think people today you know 

319.04 320.12 A: (( yeah right )) 

327.26 331.10 B: although you have to work most people uh 

331.57 338.06 B: like to have a good time like to enjoy so a very important thing in a husband and in a wife is you know 

338.51 342.61 B: should be able to to have some fun together so you know 

341.41 342.64 A: that's true 

342.76 350.44 B: some people uh you go out with them some people are more fun and some people are less fun [noise] 

351.23 357.01 B: some people you can have easier to have a good time with some people some people it's not very easy to have a good time with 

356.53 363.49 A: yeah i agree i mean if you meet a girl [mn] i figured you meet a girl and she'd no matter how attractive she is if uh 

357.05 360.70 B: it's also an important thing what 

362.09 362.79 B: (( that's )) 

363.90 368.36 A: you don't get along that well with her it's gonna be it's not gonna be worth it 

365.53 371.03 B: right if she's not the if you're too smart and she's you know 

371.38 375.22 B: way off y- in the long term you know 

375.88 378.23 B: not it's not gonna work 

376.35 377.61 A: problematic 

378.53 389.62 B: what what do you find for example the m- th- th- th- the thing what what made you [noise] say you're going out for three years now what made you go out with your girl like what what did you see in her that made you 

389.64 391.99 B: feel this is the one that uh 

393.07 393.93 A: hmm 

393.21 396.55 B: i believe the first thing you met her uh was 

397.30 401.29 B: attractive to you was that the point where it started off 

398.52 400.47 A: yeah i mean i saw her 

401.35 402.55 A: i saw 

401.56 408.31 B: now what what did you see in her that made you uh have this relationship going for three years 

408.75 410.81 A: her oh i think at first 

411.53 414.13 A: [mn] i just liked her intelligence 

414.35 415.80 B: right 

415.01 416.40 A: and um 

416.45 427.80 A: her outgoing personality i admit that i really liked that [mn] and then i mean after time you just accustom y- accustom yourself to that person 

426.45 429.81 B: mhm 

429.83 436.52 A: and just become accustomed and you you get away and you have a way of doing things with them and little by little 

430.32 432.06 B: (( yeah )) 

436.84 444.19 B: it probably also depends depends on what type of uh person you are depending on what uh 

437.23 438.40 A: (( you know y- )) 

444.36 452.89 B: partner you should look for if you're more outgoing you should look for someone that's outgoing if you like staying home or maybe it it's the opposite you know s- 

453.81 460.83 B: if you're not outgoing look for someone outgoing so at least you'll go out sometimes some people say that but [noise] i 

461.39 463.98 B: (( don't know if i believe that )) 

465.59 466.83 A: yeah 

466.99 472.68 B: (( uh for example seeing as they do it uh business partners )) 

473.05 477.66 B: they say you should always look for someone that does not have the same talent as you have 

477.95 485.93 B: 'cause you'll you want to make sure you have a partner in business he has his side that he's enjoying you have your part that you do so 

484.48 486.47 A: yeah that's a a good point 

486.77 488.27 B: if let's say if 

488.72 492.67 B: 'cause people partner up in business and both of them are good then uh 

493.38 501.70 B: in the running the financial part of the business yeah so both of them are going to be busy it's better when your partner someone's got to be good in financial part and someone should be good let's say in 

502.13 503.96 A: the social realm 

502.36 503.32 B: (( in )) 

504.11 505.37 A: maybe 

504.73 508.56 B: so they both do something else so maybe in in a marriage 

508.62 510.67 B: there's also point you know 

510.97 515.55 B: in order for the marriage to be more exciting to have a more interesting life if you 

516.16 522.41 B: both are the exact exact types it might be a little bit boring you know 

522.80 529.09 B: so just part of the excitement is that the person you're with is a little different than you and and introduces 

526.61 529.81 A: [mn] yeah i agree with that 

528.92 540.95 B: th- the different thing what so you if you're not a person that would go skiing and and skydiving not that you wouldn't go but you wouldn't be the kind of person by yourself that you would go out and do it 

540.57 543.33 A: yeah that you wouldn't initiate that kind of thing 

541.40 555.43 B: if you find someone that's not that that that is that type of person he makes you do those things it it is enjoyable after all it's just that or maybe even a part of enjoying more is to find someone that's a little different than you 

553.98 556.73 A: (( right )) 

556.77 558.90 A: yeah i agree i didn't really think of that 

558.10 560.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] but still )) 

558.99 561.52 A: yeah the other thing you have to complement your partner 

561.54 564.54 B: you have y- uh it's it's 

563.07 564.54 A: to be a good match 

569.89 573.60 B: (( [mn] [noise] good what [mn] )) 

570.01 573.19 A: i definitely think so yeah definitely 

573.99 579.68 A: somebody who um brings out your better qualities as well you know 

580.56 585.85 B: (( also also an important thing [noise] uh )) 

587.02 588.83 B: question is though you know 

588.85 599.89 B: i i i'm wondering you know what the young people going out these days you know they are i think they they mainly look for uh it's all so different you know so many people today going out are
