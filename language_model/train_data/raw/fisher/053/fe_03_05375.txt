86.88 89.32 A: i i work commission 

89.25 90.24 B: okay 

89.42 98.89 A: so i get i really get like [mn] it's what what you call a draw rate you have to meet you have to meet the draw and if you don't meet the draw you owe them money 

94.11 95.48 B: oh draw okay 

98.70 100.40 B: [mn] right now 

99.48 104.02 A: but it works out the same as you know above minimum wage 

103.82 106.62 B: okay now what if you don't meet the draw [mn] 

106.65 107.73 B: then if 

106.67 108.81 A: then it's like you owe them money 

108.31 110.08 B: and do you really have to pay them then 

110.09 116.80 A: [sigh] well no see we get paid a week there's like a week a week lag time [sigh] 

117.27 118.11 A: so 

119.10 127.12 A: so you don't e- really end up paying them you end up owing them money and it gets taken outta your next week's pay check 

127.73 128.76 B: (( mhm [mn] oh )) 

127.90 133.98 A: so s- some weeks you do good and some weeks you do bad so it all works out in the end 

131.84 132.82 B: okay 

133.48 135.15 B: you're entirely on commission 

135.06 136.59 A: yeah 

136.19 137.16 B: okay 

136.60 137.26 A: (( y- )) 

137.26 147.55 B: so i mean but what i- [sigh] what if you really weren't do- doing well you owed them money would they just and like it didn't it didn't look like you were going to perform would they just fire you and 

144.25 145.57 A: well 

147.40 156.73 A: but around christmas time you you do well so you make more than expected so you just op- you just give them their money back at christmas time 

150.71 151.64 B: okay 

156.21 158.51 B: oh okay what do you do by the way 

157.41 158.21 A: so 

158.23 165.89 A: it all works out in the end i sell shoes i'm a shoe salesman at the big retail store we have here in 

159.68 160.48 B: yeah 

161.96 163.03 B: oh really 

165.26 167.95 B: okay e- entirely commission 

168.11 169.24 A: yeah 

168.67 172.04 B: oh really no not uh not base plus 

171.03 171.91 A: none 

172.23 177.65 A: i know it's strange but it works out you know it works well it works out about the same way you 

174.53 175.40 B: yeah 

177.50 178.59 B: okay 

178.59 179.58 A: know if 

178.83 179.80 B: i guess it was 

180.18 181.16 B: go ahead 

180.72 184.13 A: yeah make about ten bucks an hour you know 

183.25 184.22 B: okay 

184.42 185.28 B: uh-huh 

185.05 191.39 A: some weeks are really dead where you owe them like one week i owed them like three bucks 

191.39 192.25 B: uh-huh 

191.56 199.72 A: but the next week i made like eighty bucks in commission so you know you just take it out you know so in the long run it does okay 

196.39 197.40 B: okay 

199.70 206.41 B: then if you do way above your draw then they'll they may as well take you off your draw and just straight commission 

204.64 205.40 A: then 

205.52 210.61 A: yeah then they just take the money out that you owe them so it all works out the same 

210.41 213.28 B: mhm okay [lipsmack] 

213.75 214.65 B: so 

214.09 225.73 A: but yeah and but also [lipsmack] i work with a lotta people who do make minimum and i know it's tough for them to come to to make ends meet you know 

223.32 224.52 B: mhm 

226.13 231.13 A: 'cause you have to pay rent and you have to pay insurance and everything so 

229.52 230.55 B: (( [lipsmack] sure )) 

231.52 235.37 A: you know a lotta people don't even have insurance around these parts 

235.01 236.97 B: mhm 

236.07 236.92 A: so 

237.05 238.31 A: you know if something 

238.38 241.28 A: you know if they get sick or something they're kind of 

241.48 243.49 A: up the creek you know [laughter] 

242.78 256.31 B: yes oh yeah oh yeah i yeah i pay my own my own health insurance and it's not cheap yeah [sigh] well anyway i i don't know how i feel about minimum wage i kinda like things where where the market decides things rather than the government saying 

247.83 248.93 A: yeah 

255.09 257.26 A: oh yeah yeah 

256.45 258.75 B: you know but uh so

259.47 260.32 A: i mean 

259.55 260.51 B: um 

260.82 263.77 A: yeah i'm a republican so i guess you know [laughter] 

263.40 266.69 B: mhm [lipsmack] oh i probably am yeah i am too more or less yeah 

266.09 267.06 A: i guess 

267.07 273.79 A: that goes along party lines you know democrats i assume like minimum wage you know like high wages 

270.81 271.66 B: yeah 

273.73 274.99 B: right 

274.30 275.37 A: so 

275.39 282.42 A: i guess republicans are more like you know profitize everything where democrats seem to be more 

280.03 281.37 B: (( [mn] well )) 

282.65 285.41 A: you know more government control the better 

283.68 284.24 B: (( [mn] )) 

285.11 292.41 B: yeah right and live off the gov- have people depend on the government rather than be independent and 

288.67 289.64 A: yeah 

290.51 291.72 A: yeah which 

292.40 293.14 A: (( for ))

444.54 445.60 B: yeah 

447.12 456.65 B: they want to but um this this is one area that they cut back unfortunately and a lot of times they'll still keep buying things but they don't buy as many [sigh] 

451.71 453.24 A: (( oh yeah )) 

456.63 467.13 B: or they cut their budgets you know like like maybe the company's always buying twenty five hundred of this item and now they're just gonna buy you know five hundred or 

467.12 469.16 A: okay yeah 

467.71 471.72 B: they're saying well we we we always give out three things 

471.70 483.80 B: for to for our have our salesmen give away or at trade shows and we're just gonna get one thing now you know really just a lot of that it's harder to get big orders and just a lotta cutbacks it you know it it's been that way for a while 

479.52 480.78 A: yeah 

483.82 486.85 A: yeah i could see where that would be a tough business to 

483.90 485.24 B: [lipsmack] but 

486.39 492.88 B: yeah but see i'm used to this i've i've been through these down periods before nineteen eighty through eighty two 

490.43 491.40 A: (( do yeah ))

497.23 498.37 A: okay 

497.92 501.02 B: i don't know if you remember those years nineteen eighty through eighty two 

500.88 507.26 A: [mn] [lipsmack] well i yeah i remember [mn] though i wasn't in the workforce back then but 

503.59 504.82 B: there was a 

506.76 508.08 B: (( okay [sigh] )) 

508.37 509.69 B: but yeah 

508.62 511.21 A: i remember there was kind of a recession 

510.56 525.45 B: you would have been about seventeen or so yeah eighteen oh yeah a very bad one and not only were were there layoffs and high unemployment [lipsmack] but unlike now inflation was runaway i mean i- it was like 

512.62 513.70 A: yeah 

523.21 524.15 A: yeah 

525.61 536.27 B: prime rate was up to twenty per cent i i mean interest rates were just crazy you know the housing market was shot and and uh it was just people don't don't remember 

527.66 528.91 A: mhm 

530.88 531.77 A: yeah 

533.67 534.96 A: yeah 

536.31 537.53 B: very much 

537.21 538.41 A: yeah 

537.79 543.07 B: but oh and there was bl- both blue and white collar being laid off enormous numbers 

542.13 544.90 A: [noise] yeah which can be an 

543.36 544.64 B: and it was really 

545.10 548.69 A: which can be an argument for raising the minimum wage 

548.47 556.01 B: [lipsmack] oh i don't know that kind of that's incentive for companies to go around that somehow or [sigh] 

550.09 551.05 A: [laughter] 

556.01 567.82 B: not hire people or to maybe go into business then you know i mean you don't you start doing that things and people aren't willing to go into business and take chances and that's that's what you need 

558.15 559.10 A: yeah 

565.88 566.91 A: yeah 

567.18 570.55 A: that's one thing i like about commission you know 'cause 

570.83 574.93 A: you know you get paid on how much you exert yourself 

574.15 575.79 B: what you produce sure 

575.40 577.27 A: yeah what you produce i mean 

576.98 578.31 B: yeah 

577.30 578.13 A: (( you [mn] )) 

578.19 586.60 A: i mean you go to if you don't wanna go to work you don't have to go to work i mean you won't get paid but you won't you know [sigh] 

582.27 583.19 B: mhm 

586.91 588.94 A: it's no big uh deal 

589.39 593.06 A: so yeah you you work as hard as you want 

589.53 590.61 B: mhm 

593.39 596.10 A: so i that's why i like commission 

596.27 597.71 B: oh yeah uh-huh 

598.29 599.95 B: but a lot of people
