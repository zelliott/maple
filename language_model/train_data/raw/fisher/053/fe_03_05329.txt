216.83 221.45 A: that's right yeah [laughter] yes f- f- fertilize the other two two other 

220.92 227.77 B: love yeah and pellets they got to chew on you know so we're for a while there we were even maker making it's own food but that to that was pretty labor intensive so 

221.86 222.71 A: yes 

223.47 224.14 A: yeah 

227.43 228.46 A: (( yeah )) 

227.84 229.48 B: how about you what did you 

229.82 237.68 A: well you know like our uh lab kind of came through the same scenario we uh got her at the humane society 

236.42 238.01 B: (( um [noise] mhm )) 

239.23 251.17 A: she's nipped same thing she's been a great dog just a real good temperament as a matter of fact prior to getting her we had looked at i don't know if you're familiar with the uh bouvier which is uh you know dog of flanders 

248.76 249.61 B: yes 

250.55 252.05 B: yes mhm 

251.33 252.32 A: um 

252.44 260.55 A: i'd taken one of those surveys on a. o. l. where it's r- where it says you know what's your perfect dog and that's what it came up with 

258.36 259.22 B: uh-huh 

260.45 262.76 B: oh you took a questionnaire like a question yeah 

260.60 261.44 A: but 

261.68 265.05 A: yeah a qu- sort of a questionnaire and mine was the bouvier 

263.35 264.18 B: (( mhm they're )) 

265.17 275.49 A: but um i didn't want to pay the price the retail price of what those things run so i found a um i found an organisation that uh rescues bouviers 

270.30 271.51 B: expensive 

275.01 275.86 B: uh-huh 

275.80 277.08 A: and uh 

276.84 279.85 A: it was really interesting because they go through everything once you 

279.78 281.02 A: apply to them 

280.60 281.40 B: uh-huh 

280.97 295.22 A: they try to match you up with a dog be- before you can even matched up it's just like a real adoption they have somebody come out and do a home study and everything [laughter] and yeah and uh they're that serious about it but what they said was bad about the bouviers especially the ones that are older 

282.09 282.91 B: uh-huh 

286.66 287.89 B: oh really 

291.07 294.03 B: (( hm )) 

294.50 295.85 B: (( mhm )) 

295.14 304.19 A: is like i said uh we have a it's a second marriage for both of us and so my wife brought two pomeranians into the marriage and um they said 

302.32 305.76 B: mhm that one won smith's er a couple of years ago didn't a pomeranian win 

305.64 308.10 A: uh probably so yeah yeah 

306.51 309.33 B: yeah yeah delightful little dog yeah 

308.62 312.57 A: yeah they're they're cute little dogs but but because they yap 

309.42 311.10 B: (( mm )) 

312.24 313.74 B: [laughter] 

313.01 322.18 A: uh uh the older bouvier they they were afraid would not accept them accept that you know environment too well 'cause the bouviers just really laid back and 

314.47 315.45 B: uh-huh 

321.53 327.39 B: well they're like a herding dog aren't they and and don't they have that long hair or is am i thinking that yeah is it the f- 

322.74 324.78 A: exactly yeah same thing 

325.22 326.22 A: yes 

326.57 328.53 A: no you got it you had it being like 

327.61 333.08 B: komodog komed i'm thinking of the komodo or kumodin or whatever it is it's like matted the uh thinking of a different breed 

331.04 331.72 A: (( just )) 

331.83 336.39 A: oh that's the yeah that's the uh kind of like braided hair and all of that water whatever but a 

334.88 337.85 B: yeah what kind of what kind of hair does a bouvier have so i gue- 

336.83 340.74 A: bouvier has the same thing as a shaggy it has a long shaggy black hair though 

340.35 341.34 B: yes 

341.09 345.26 A: yeah it's in fact it looks like a big schnauzer that's what the bouvier is 

343.81 346.70 B: oh okay that's right that's right 

345.55 348.04 A: yeah it looks like an overgrown schnauzer 

346.96 348.82 B: are they aggressive or do they 

348.39 353.46 A: no no not really but but they're the same thing they're very much a one person dog 

351.62 354.08 B: (( um mhm )) 

353.46 356.48 A: and they said that uh in our case that in 

356.39 364.34 A: a bouvier that has come from a home already would adjust the would adjust to the humans fine but may have trouble adjusting to other dogs 

363.89 364.83 B: i see 

364.15 370.92 A: and uh the- it said they were as blunt said you know we can't guarantee you could leave the three together and go out and not come home and have one of them chewed up [laughter] 

370.91 376.24 A: and i said well i don't think my li- wife would like that so so we went to the humane society and uh 

371.16 372.05 B: oh 

373.34 374.24 B: yeah 

375.27 376.13 B: uh-huh
