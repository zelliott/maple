72.23 73.26 B: so ah yeah 

73.59 82.46 B: yeah so what do i feel about the ah ah about the minimum wage well at five dollars and fifteen cents an hour it sounds pretty low to me 

82.73 83.70 B: um 

82.90 91.83 A: ah well ah well [mn] i mean the yeah it is kind of low for the area just because rents are so high compared to the wages 

87.88 89.08 B: well they 

89.98 90.73 B: yeah 

91.55 92.46 B: yeah 

91.89 102.28 A: i mean people end up spending half to three fourths of their wages on rent and sometimes they end up having to take a second job just to pay 

97.73 98.68 B: oh boy 

103.14 104.83 A: rent i mean well i mean when 

105.00 108.51 A: when for example where we're staying ah it's a 

109.51 116.25 A: [sigh] it's a three bedroom house and you know it's eight seventy five i mean it's 

116.73 119.78 A: it kind of stretches things [laughter] 

118.53 122.10 B: yeah yeah and that's considered lower rent for around here 

121.70 129.47 A: well yeah yeah i mean it that well that's low but ah when when well i'm only making a little bit above six you know i mean it's 

125.81 127.94 B: yeah they're not making money 

128.26 129.53 B: yeah 

129.63 132.40 B: (( yeah gotcha what what kind of work do you do yeah )) 

132.24 138.69 A: oh um well i'm just doing odds and ends ah the one i'm the job i'm talking about is a security guard 

139.24 149.37 A: yeah i just got out of ah college with my accounting degree yeah and so i'm [laughter] like yeah a real good time to get out of college 

142.94 144.24 B: (( uh-huh yeah oh really )) 

148.83 150.70 B: there there's no jobs there 

149.72 160.63 A: [laughter] oh yeah i mean there's it's yeah it's it's miserable i mean once tax season comes it'll it i'll have a lot better chances yeah 

158.17 159.39 B: it'll pick up yeah 

159.67 161.61 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

161.93 168.74 B: well what do i think about the minimum wage i think it's low yeah but ah and do i think you know i i'm not sure the minimum wage 

164.82 166.80 A: yeah 

169.18 178.49 B: ah matters if the cost of living is low but if the cost of living is high and the minimum wage is low then there's just there's a disconnect and i think something needs to be done but 

172.42 174.22 A: yeah 

177.24 184.40 A: yeah well yeah i mean for idaho well like i said i mean i didn't look at any different states you know the 

184.30 192.46 A: cost of living and all that kind of stuff and for everywhere else our our cost of living is high compared to 

185.59 186.44 B: yeah 

192.67 204.68 A: our our income i mean the other place that was different was hawaii which makes sense i mean everybody wants to live there and the people that live there and try to work there they they get paid squat 

195.17 195.92 B: yeah 

204.97 205.84 B: really 

205.80 207.71 A: oh it was it was [mn] 

207.76 211.07 A: they were making less than than than we do here in idaho 

211.09 212.80 A: and the rents were like 

213.03 214.44 B: yeah the rents are very high 

213.27 214.11 A: (( oh )) 

214.19 216.68 A: it's just unbelievable i mean 

216.79 223.35 A: you know for the same same houses out here you know it's like twelve to to fifteen hundred a month i mean just you know 

223.89 230.16 A: unreasonable compared to you know considering how much they had to but then i talked to a friend of mine and they a 

230.15 240.78 A: lot of their ancest- a lot of them get ancestral land and so you know they don't have to pay anything for it if they're of hawaiian decent and all that so i mean it's 

233.21 234.27 B: (( yeah yeah i see )) 

239.97 241.75 B: (( yeah gotcha yeah )) 

241.40 250.68 A: it makes sense but ah yeah i mean it's it is pretty bad when when the cost of livings are high compared to the compared to the minimum wage 

243.41 244.18 B: sure 

251.20 253.08 B: yeah yeah i agree 

251.96 256.51 A: and ah so ah what do you do up there

338.63 340.10 A: (( yeah ah )) 

339.18 341.35 B: yeah it's the worst in the country here 

341.38 344.75 A: oh ah ah yeah i can imagine i mean it's 

344.78 353.89 A: i mean at least i mean 'cause idaho's a right to work state and so you know pretty much employers can fire you anytime you want you can quit anytime you want 

353.15 355.36 B: oh in in that state you mean 

355.49 358.24 A: yeah well yeah in other words and so i mean

381.94 383.95 A: yeah but ah 

384.00 388.36 A: yeah i mean the one i felt was the most interesting i was looking at ah american express 

388.64 389.51 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

388.69 392.08 A: and they ended up firing a third of their force 

392.01 395.74 B: american express financial advisors or which

424.98 429.40 A: they've already got people that they know in from inside the company and there's you know 

428.70 430.17 B: (( whew yeah yeah )) 

429.95 435.31 A: but but yeah i mean it's it's it's it's it's ah 

430.76 431.77 B: oh no 

435.75 440.75 A: i mean it's not quite depression but it's it's getting there it seems to [laughter] me

465.26 474.33 A: and so he's been trying to find a job down there and it's just i mean he writes ah he does grant writing and so you think you know it'd be fairly easy to find 

474.63 476.44 B: (( yeah oh well )) 

476.00 483.94 A: but yeah i mean it's this is a pretty miserable climate right now so how much longer do you have in law school

571.20 575.78 A: it was just unreal how much credit they got just just because 

576.59 585.31 A: they wouldn't take no you know i mean you know if somebody offered them they'd take it and they'd max it out and then they wondered why they couldn't pay their bills 

585.70 586.30 B: (( yeah )) 

586.07 589.79 A: i don't know so are you married
