234.92 235.77 A: (( ah it's )) 

235.97 242.87 A: a i was going to say that's the thing i noticed about our kids too you know is that you know they're they tend to be a little rough with the animals you know and stuff 

242.01 244.48 B: mhm [noise] 

243.04 248.26 A: you know gotta really have an animal that's gentle you know that doesn't mind it as much you know 

248.40 263.14 B: yes it's myra she likes to [noise] tug at her ears and little bit and uh pets her pretty hard you know you have to tell her all time be gentle be gentle but but uh the doberman's [noise] pretty uh pretty laid back so 

253.31 254.33 A: yeah 

258.59 259.89 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

263.20 267.93 B: she just kind of kind of lets her go go at her own pace let her what she wants to do

268.36 269.40 A: yeah 

268.59 269.42 B: (( but uh )) 

269.58 275.82 A: well it's now um momma kitty that i was talking about now that this is a cat that ever since it was a kitten 

275.87 289.52 A: my oldest boy was probably like maybe two and a half or so and he used to like basically drag the cat around anywhere you know and we were always like do nice to the kitty do nice and every chance he got you know and so now the cat's at a point where i mean 

289.44 295.77 A: anybody can just pick the cat up i mean you could just hold it by its stomach and no problem or anything you know it 

293.61 296.69 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

295.92 300.38 A: really warmed up to you know to people because of the kids i guess you know it 

299.79 301.59 B: uh-huh yeah 

300.56 303.05 A: got really just so used to it 

302.57 303.88 B: yeah 

303.10 309.86 A: that's probably what's going to happen with your dog you know with the um the not the doberm- well yeah the doberman i guess you were saying 

305.64 307.78 B: oh yeah yes 

310.02 311.32 B: yes she's 

311.89 315.39 B: she's she's real accepting she's we've we've 

313.64 314.54 A: yeah 

315.50 325.26 B: i live oh out in the country pretty far and and i work midnights and my wife's been we've just we moved out here i don't know two and a half years ago 

325.66 331.82 B: and the wife was wanting a large dog to keep around the farm and keep in the house too so 

331.02 332.78 A: oh for like protection 

332.45 338.03 B: yeah so i mean we we examined every breed we i mean 

332.95 334.19 A: yeah 

337.88 350.58 B: and for some reason or another we decided that that wasn't right for us and i don't know where she saw one one day at that that gave her the idea but anyway she came home one day and said i wanna look into getting a doberman 

350.20 351.14 A: ah 

350.77 362.07 B: so we we checked with the breeders and and talked you know checked into their personalities and how they were with everything and and they just sounded like the perfect dog so [laughter] we uh 

362.13 366.85 B: my wife said well that's what i want i think i want a doberman so i got a 

365.91 366.68 A: (( ah now it )) 

367.33 369.04 B: (( i uh got i )) 

369.33 375.09 B: got i contacted the aq- ah not the a._q._h._a. the [laughter] uh american kennel club 

374.65 375.68 A: yeah 

375.32 387.78 B: and got uh [sigh] a lead on some breeder and actually they told me basically to go to the internet and get it off of there so i printed off twenty six pages of doberman breeders in the united states 

386.15 387.21 A: wow 

387.87 392.51 B: so of course i i started with the ones closer to kentucky uh 

391.46 392.45 A: yeah 

392.98 400.92 B: and started calling and it took me two weeks to find anybody that had any puppies for sale and uh 

401.03 405.20 B: i finally found some a little bit west of fort worth texas 

404.90 405.92 A: wow 

405.72 407.86 B: so [laughter] we 

406.53 408.41 A: [laughter] went driving [laughter] 

408.06 412.82 B: yeah so we we flew to fort worth and uh 

412.99 418.30 B: well like myra was only she was only about six or seven months old then 

417.92 419.12 A: yeah 

418.66 432.09 B: [laughter] flew flew her flew the whole family to fort worth stayed two or three days and picked up our dog and flew back [laughter] you know it actually cost more to fly the dog than it did us [laughter] 

429.13 432.44 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah that's funny though 

432.17 433.62 B: yeah it's uh [mn] 

432.55 446.39 A: and i i'll tell you you know what's interesting to me thinking about that is that when i picture a doberman i think you know okay now here's an animal that is a good guard dog and you know a very protective dog and you know kind of you know wouldn't wanna mess with a doberman you know 

446.33 450.95 A: and it's just funny to me that that's the dog that you have that's the best with your daughter you know 

450.43 454.41 B: well that's that's the funny everybody has the 

454.72 460.47 B: preconceived idea that dobermans are just totally uncontrollable and mean all the time 

459.85 462.00 A: yeah i don't think that's true though 

461.64 470.41 B: and uh [sigh] you know that whe- well when you see a guard dog in the movies it's either a rottweiler or a doberman 

467.91 468.79 A: yeah 

469.88 471.44 A: yep that's true 

471.25 476.71 B: so i mean everybody thinks that you know that they're that they're not good family dogs well 

476.97 480.32 B: that's very far from the truth they are 

480.65 486.51 B: very laid back with the family they they love their families but 

486.61 489.21 B: [cough] anybody else that comes up 

489.62 494.90 B: we put her out because i mean she does not like intruders right uh 

490.85 491.87 A: yeah 

493.93 495.31 A: yeah 

495.10 497.01 B: now if 

497.21 506.06 B: if you invite 'em in and introduce 'em she'll accept 'em that time but the next time they come to the door you've got to do it all over again 

505.57 506.96 A: yeah 

506.40 518.24 B: [laughter] yeah she doesn't just because you were allowed in once doesn't mean that you're allowed in next time so i mean she's she's just awesome we we love her to death 'cause she 

511.12 513.05 A: [laughter] keep coming in right [laughter] 

516.97 520.74 A: yeah well that's good though it seems like she does her job you know yeah 

518.55 519.19 B: (( yeah )) 

520.04 532.58 B: yeah she's she's just a lot of fun and has done everything that uh we were looking for we're well pleased with her as a matter of fact we're we are considering in another year or two getting another one 

520.86 522.02 A: yeah 

532.13 533.55 A: oh nice 

533.08 534.28 B: yeah so 

534.44 548.30 B: uh of course [laughter] we we really liked the breeder that we got her from so we're going to uh you know we'll wait until she has another litter well she has litters all the time but we'd kind of like to get a a uh 

545.45 546.43 A: yeah 

549.14 552.38 B: brother or sister of of the dog we have 

551.77 553.40 A: oh yeah sure 

552.65 557.19 B: (( you know out of a you know it would be out of a different litter but but ah )) 

556.27 557.91 A: (( you know yeah )) 

558.05 570.32 B: but you know so it it may take a couple of years to uh to get that pair lined up again 'cause she she's a she's a breeder of one of the top breeders in the united states and you know so there's 

564.25 565.30 A: yeah 

568.56 569.82 A: oh yeah 

570.49 580.51 B: she she has she has puppies and top quality puppies all the time it's just a matter of you know if you wanna wait for a certain one or if you just wanna take whatever she's got so 

579.74 581.64 A: yeah yeah 

581.45 584.61 B: so [sigh] but uh we've been well pleased with her 

584.48 589.14 A: yeah so did you guys have to do like some sort of formal um 

589.20 592.04 A: training for your dog or i mean have you ever
