221.14 222.28 B: i mean do you 

222.67 231.05 B: like do you do y- do you think that it's good that they move they keep moving all their sports to cable like they don't have anything on network these days 

230.47 232.47 A: [noise] no i don't think it's fair 

232.29 233.52 B: i'm sorry 

232.98 234.75 A: i don't think it's right 

234.16 236.26 B: yeah i know i mean 

235.80 237.49 A: it's all money thing 

237.28 241.28 B: yeah basketball they just showed the finals that's about it 

240.69 241.95 A: yeah 

241.30 247.07 B: on a._b._c. every everything else [noise] was like e._s._p._n. and p._n._d. and 

244.43 245.52 A: right 

246.08 258.86 A: as it's a shame it it's it's a surprising how it used to be a sport where somebody could take [noise] and watch it or be involved into it and now i mean just look at the price it costs to go to the game 

252.93 255.63 B: exactly yeah 

258.60 264.59 B: exac- oh i know it's crazy just ridiculous like you could never afford it 

264.29 265.52 A: i know goodwa 

265.54 274.23 A: goodwa at braves game or go to a uh hawkes game here in georgia you got you're almost dropping a hundred dollar bill for two people 

269.41 270.41 B: uh-huh 

273.97 283.72 B: yeah i mean i i i see i don't know but that's true that's true i mean baseball is still a little better but like basketball and football are just crazy 

282.87 284.50 A: [noise] it is 

283.93 288.41 B: like baseball at least you can get ch- ch- cheaper tickets like if you want it 

287.81 290.75 A: uh-huh yeah they be up in the boon decks 

288.47 289.70 B: but like 

290.04 296.12 B: yeah but for the others like there's no option like you've got cheaper so you you got to shell out like thirty forty bucks 

295.47 296.68 A: yeah 

296.66 297.85 B: and uh 

298.29 301.68 B: and then yeah they're not even going to show it on t._v. so 

301.31 305.35 A: [noise] i think that that's wrong the same way it is with level lake too though you know 

305.47 307.43 A: that's all going cable too 

307.28 309.00 B: yeah that's true 

308.70 310.89 A: (( 'cause we've got a like world series )) 

310.55 311.72 B: yeah 

311.12 316.95 A: they uh they make that on uh uh cable and e._s._p._n. takes it and 

317.09 322.31 A: and uh locks on to it just to make to make money 

317.17 318.07 B: yeah 

319.07 320.15 B: mhm 

321.76 326.07 B: oh yeah that's crazy everything was going down i mean 

324.24 325.05 A: and it 

325.11 326.12 A: (( it is )) 

325.89 337.46 B: i was reading some time about it how they even wanted to move all the football games to cable as well and then somebody intervened and they say well football has to stay on 

337.49 338.97 B: the networks 

338.92 343.71 A: well y- you're going to see it eventually where it's going to be it's all going to be on cable 

343.10 350.17 B: yeah eventu- i mean i i think so like it just too much money involved in there so 

350.55 352.94 B: it's just not 

352.04 355.06 A: well just look at how much they're paying these players 

354.76 357.26 B: mm oh yeah i mean yeah 

356.61 360.45 A: like that uh wasn't it who was it that they 

360.68 364.01 A: signed uh [lipsmack] [noise] robinson 

364.10 365.84 A: i think it was robinson 

365.87 371.27 A: it just he was playing uh college ball and he gave up his college ball and he went to pro 

370.98 372.06 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

371.42 373.71 A: uh i forget what team he went to 

373.63 378.85 B: [noise] i mean yeah this just crazy like look at errol like two fifty million 

373.96 374.82 A: but 

378.34 379.40 A: yeah 

378.86 385.67 B: i mean that's just crazy money like you're right you know they have to they have to recover it somehow [mn] 

385.57 391.68 A: well i don't i don't think it's that i don't think it's even that bad they just i think they ought to put a cap on on the 

390.78 393.08 B: uh they have to like i mean 

393.19 398.92 B: it's crazy like if this it's just in the u._s. like it is so much money in sports 

398.71 399.75 A: yeah 

399.18 400.01 B: i mean 

400.15 405.37 B: like i was just reading today it's have you do you do you follow soccer at all 

404.58 406.00 A: (( [noise] a little bit )) 

405.67 411.83 B: yeah like so david beckham was the captain of england he i 

411.77 416.43 B: mean one of the best soccer players in the world like really good and they he

432.69 433.82 A: [noise] that's right 

435.52 436.74 A: yeah 

436.17 437.36 B: so that's 

437.66 442.51 A: well i just wonder how long it's going to be soccer's going to be in the same line as the rest of them 

441.99 443.13 B: yeah 

442.53 445.70 A: you know 'cause soccer's getting more popular all the time 

445.14 446.54 B: mhm 

445.90 448.29 A: i know down here in georgia they uh

476.39 478.02 B: so it's going to be big too 

478.59 487.62 B: mm yeah and i mean this is definitely gaining popularity 'specially like in in for girls when this soon as the u._s. won the world cup 

481.91 483.04 A: oh yeah 

487.06 488.10 A: (( mhm )) 

487.81 490.09 B: yeah so that's definitely gotten uh 

490.55 491.60 B: bigger 

491.86 499.06 B: here which is 'cause soccer is like the most popular sport in the world everywhere everybody plays soccer 

493.49 494.34 A: (( [noise] [noise] ))

500.64 503.03 A: well you know all the european countries play it 

502.44 513.43 B: yeah exactly like i mean you could pick all country in the world and probably it's going to be playing soccer you know like many other things are very selective like i mean 

508.34 509.28 A: yeah 

513.82 520.39 B: selective uh representation but it's not soccer i mean basketball is probably too like very popular 

520.86 522.71 B: but not that popular 

522.76 523.94 B: also 

524.46 530.15 A: well th- basketball it seem like it has it it's own elite group of people have 

529.65 531.49 B: yeah that's true 

530.23 532.25 A: you noticed that 

532.39 539.14 A: there's just there's just people that you got people that like football yeah but they'll turn to to baseball too 

538.73 539.78 B: mhm 

539.17 545.86 A: but then you people that's locked into basketball and that's all that's all they want to take 'em pay any attention to is basketball 

545.18 553.50 B: yeah that's true i mean what i like is i i like to follow pretty much everything you know i'm not like super 

550.73 551.72 A: uh-huh 

554.03 560.15 B: that i'm gong to just go basketball or i'm just going to go this but i mean i like in general like to 

560.37 564.04 B: i mean i like tennis i like to follow that also 

564.18 568.53 B: and you know like even like track and field sometimes 

567.91 569.36 A: yeah yeah 

568.80 577.04 B: so um it's kinda fun like every sport i think has it's own ping like you know that you can enjoy 

575.92 579.79 A: [noise] well see a lot of it i think it all depends on what part of the county too 

579.45 581.37 B: right i think so 

581.16 582.47 A: but uh 

582.76 592.87 A: in uh out in west when i lived out there they had seasons where they took and did football them they did baseball then they did uh soccer 

586.32 587.32 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

592.88 596.52 A: uh and that was a more 

596.53 599.89 A: versatile area where you gonna that it took 

597.89 599.00 B: oh i see
