0.79 1.79 B: hi 

1.56 2.97 A: (( [noise] hi )) 

3.12 4.92 B: i'm tom and you are 

4.34 6.10 A: oh okay i'm amal 

6.44 7.91 B: amal okay 

7.23 8.71 A: yeah 

8.16 11.12 B: [sigh] so how do you draw the line on humor [sigh] 

11.43 13.27 A: [mn] uh 

13.28 19.46 A: i don't think i really do [laughter] because if it's if it's funny it's that's pretty much acceptable to me unless it's uh i don't know 

19.38 30.80 A: i guess maybe derogato- i guess like pretty much like i guess with uh culture and ethnic type things other than that i don't really see anything else 'cause it might up- the only reason i think that is 'cause it might offend somebody else 

24.49 25.35 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

31.24 45.56 B: that's that's an odd thing 'cause i sometimes find that uh humor i just look at it and i say you know that's based on hurting people and i don't like that you know the humor i like best is the one where [sigh] um you know [mn] 

45.75 49.66 B: like the flying caravatso brothers they have a a a routine where uh 

49.68 56.35 B: somebody says are you laughing with me or at me [sigh] and the the person sort of 

49.69 50.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

56.56 60.78 B: pushes the au- audience to say at you and then he says atchoo gesundheit all 

61.75 71.17 B: right um which is um not humor of pain not slapstick um humor of pain tends to strike me as being something that's [sigh] 

71.58 72.98 B: really problematic 

71.84 73.96 A: (( mhm )) 

73.30 77.31 B: you know where someone's being hurt in order to cause someone else to laugh 

78.15 79.43 A: (( [noise] [noise] hm )) 

79.51 86.82 A: well that's what that's what yeah i mean [mn] i even saw an interview with jim carrey and he was like yeah you know sometimes it's great to be in pain 'cause that's where my best stuff comes from 

86.63 87.86 B: mhm 

87.35 88.54 A: but uh 

88.63 90.29 A: (( yeah i don't know it's a )) 

89.13 91.14 B: probably why i don't like jim carrey 

90.83 92.13 A: [laughter] 

92.39 93.82 A: oh really you don't like him 

93.53 102.93 B: [laughter] uh he can occasionally be good but most of the time he's just over the top and what he's basing it on is either [sigh] hurting someone else or hurting himself 

104.28 112.41 A: [noise] yeah but uh like i don't know like in dumb and dumber i was just oh i was cracking up the whole entire time [laughter] it was just so funny i don't mm 

110.21 111.40 B: yeah and i 

111.58 118.67 B: i just find that kind of humor just leaves me cold it's not that i think it's wrong or anything like that it just doesn't do anything for me 

118.65 119.73 A: (( yeah )) 

119.15 121.10 B: i just don't find it funny 

121.22 124.54 A: yeah i mean just depends on yeah i guess how your preferences 

125.27 126.29 B: mhm 

125.68 130.64 A: yeah i don't know i just yeah i don't know like seinfeld those type of that type of humor i like and uh 

131.06 135.92 A: i don't know um you know the simpsons is good humor like i always love jim carrey's stuff though 

135.62 136.72 B: mhm 

136.74 144.05 A: so yeah i don't know i mean i have no idea where their inspirations come from [mn] or anything like that but yeah i just you know whenever it's funny i just know it so 

140.91 141.73 B: mhm 

144.43 148.00 B: [lipsmack] yeah and sometimes we're laughing so that we won't cry 

148.47 149.58 A: [laughter] 

149.01 151.53 B: right and [sigh] um 

150.46 153.42 A: (( yeah yeah if you go see like a really really bad movie [laughter] [mn] )) 

153.39 157.28 B: uh yeah mhm [mn] and i just find that kind of humor 

156.85 157.41 A: (( [noise] )) 

158.81 160.04 B: uncomfortable 

160.13 168.05 B: um it's not that i say that anybody shouldn't do it or anything like that it's just that it really leaves me saying i don't really wanna laugh at that [mn] yeah 

168.45 169.61 A: yeah 

170.37 171.10 A: (( so )) 

171.66 180.35 A: (( i remember when when i saw eyes wide shut [laughter] we were just laughing the whole entire time it was almost like there was almost nobody in the theater too which is )) 

175.77 176.66 B: mhm 

177.07 177.91 B: yeah 

180.28 187.18 A: it was like i guess nine of us and then there was like a few couples here and there we were all i don't know i don't know why you would bring a date to that movie but [mn] 

184.18 185.04 B: mhm 

187.94 193.68 A: (( [mn] i was just i don't know we were just thinking it was just so bad and boring and we just kept we just kept laughing about things )) 

193.39 194.28 B: mhm 

194.79 196.73 B: [mn] yeah and and 

196.83 203.73 B: that kind of thing just sorta leaves me sort of saying what you know um let me go and get something that actually 

204.29 206.59 B: has some intelligence to it [mn] 

206.61 207.61 A: yeah 

207.02 210.34 B: you know i find things that are intelligent a lot more funny 

210.72 212.56 B: than things that are stupid 

213.42 214.31 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

213.58 218.74 B: in general you know every so often [sigh] there is something that's both 

219.12 226.63 B: funny and um and stupid that i sorta like the the whole thing in blazing saddles of one false move and the nigger gets it 

226.33 228.19 A: yeah [laughter] 

227.19 231.58 B: [sigh] you know it on one level that's incredibly stupid but it's also 

232.24 234.25 B: intelligent and funny 

235.12 241.53 A: [noise] yeah yeah blazing saddles was hilarious there was a lot of dumb things in that do you remember the tollbooth scene 

235.65 236.42 B: (( you know )) 

241.37 242.96 B: yeah yeah that 

242.02 243.89 A: [laughter] 

243.05 249.57 B: that that parts of it just sort of leave me cold you know i mean again that's why i like movies like airplane 

249.74 250.72 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

250.12 253.68 B: where the the type of humor changes 

253.74 256.01 B: every time you wait a second 

256.67 257.46 A: (( mm )) 

256.79 258.14 B: right so there's 

258.71 263.48 B: it's it's not just being the humor of the unexpected 

263.58 268.59 B: right which is what humor is all about it's about [sigh] doing something that nobody expects you'll do 

263.80 264.83 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

268.76 269.72 B: but 

269.84 271.33 B: on a mental level 

271.34 275.99 B: the what's unexpected is what type of humor they'll do next 

276.77 277.36 A: (( [noise] )) 

277.55 278.77 A: [mn] that's true 

279.31 288.49 A: that's true so yeah i don't know but i don't i like a i guess a combin- yeah that's true i think most people probably like a combination of both you know intelligent stu- stupidity you know everything an 

287.63 288.55 B: mhm 

288.55 292.52 A: all encompassing not just like one complete thing the whole entire time 

288.81 289.74 B: yeah 

293.14 293.94 B: (( ah )) 

293.77 297.43 A: that's probably why like seinfeld's so great it had both every single time 

295.54 296.40 B: mhm 

297.38 298.24 B: mhm 

298.52 301.78 B: yeah and i never found seinfeld particularly funny 

302.17 304.09 B: all about um 

304.22 311.61 B: just sort of oh like uh there's nothing particular happening here and these people are doing stupid things 

311.65 324.06 A: yeah well i mean there there's intelligent humor in there too though it wasn't yeah it it was a b a bunch of stupidity type things but there was a decent amount of you know especially when it was uh just him talking to other people or or whatever you know that was 

317.60 318.39 B: mhm 

322.24 323.10 B: mhm 

324.03 334.42 A: that was you know it was pretty funny and then you know [mn] they always had of course they have that one character who was always stupid was kramer and then everyone else was you know everyone else was pretty much you know for the most part you know intelligent type funny 

333.85 334.76 B: yeah 

335.01 340.86 B: it it's odd because i tended to find kramer a more sympathetic character and actually 

341.13 344.04 B: intelligent on a different level than the other people 

344.84 346.72 A: (( but mm yeah )) 

345.38 349.59 B: you know there's you know the the couple of times i watched it he was 

349.84 354.11 B: (( more absurdist more dadaist you know more [sigh] )) 

354.25 356.39 B: off on the edge of what's 

356.53 360.41 B: acceptable to say and in that level 

360.45 366.48 B: very refreshing the other people were all doing sort of um standard 

366.83 372.15 B: perfectly acceptable behaviors and his behavior was more um 

373.46 376.22 B: it had its own internal logic 

377.26 383.86 B: um it was in fact really you know he was really doing things that logically fit with who he was 

377.41 378.12 A: (( mhm )) 

383.70 385.07 A: right 

384.85 386.02 B: um 

386.07 388.95 B: [lipsmack] but it was skewed 

389.23 392.76 B: it was off in a a different direction than the way anyone else thought 

393.11 395.47 B: and that's a form of intelligence 

395.56 396.43 B: to me 

398.06 400.47 B: you know where something is um 

401.33 406.49 B: unexpected and still incredibly consistent 

407.54 409.81 B: because he was a very consistent character 

410.26 411.89 A: right right 

412.75 427.26 A: yeah i completely agree it just you know with the whole i don't know but intelligence and stuff i mean yeah he did things that of course that you would expect from him and you know that's the kinda character he was and you know he he he was supposed to be you know kinda that one you know 

423.68 424.56 B: mhm 

427.31 441.40 A: stupid guy basically that have all these different ideas and do different all these weird things basically and [sigh] you know kinda go off the wall but uh i mean i think that's just what his mould was of like he kinda kept the show like all together 'cause if you if you just had the other three 

434.69 435.54 B: mhm 

437.67 438.47 B: yeah 

441.10 441.96 B: mhm 

441.31 446.87 A: you know it would just been a little bland tell you the truth if you know with kramer in the mix it pretty much made it perfect 

444.26 445.08 B: uh-huh 

446.88 456.19 B: yeah and i'm kinda weird and off the wall and i think differently from the other people around me so you know i like having a character there who does think differently 

456.25 458.50 B: um and is not always 

458.83 460.53 B: (( you know i'm [laughter] )) 

460.70 466.46 B: i didn't always think that what he was doing was all that strange it was just being consistent for him 

466.76 469.70 A: right [noise] no that's true 

470.32 472.27 B: you know just being somebody who 

470.38 471.52 A: (( exactly true )) 

472.65 477.49 B: [lipsmack] really knows who he is either consciously or unconsciously 

475.34 475.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

477.92 480.23 B: and stays with it 

477.98 479.73 A: right 

480.67 489.84 B: and in that sense um he's a lot more like me or i'm a lot more like him than most of the other characters who are being pretty hypocritical a lot of the time 

490.22 491.72 A: right 

491.47 493.38 B: (( you know and )) 

492.24 494.10 A: just like forrest gump in a way 

494.11 494.92 B: (( huh )) 

494.96 497.03 A: he's just like forrest gump in a way 

497.00 504.68 B: [mn] i i didn't particularly care for forrest gump who was stupid around doing it you know he never 

504.15 510.20 A: [mn] but there was an intelligence to that because that's what he did he wan- he whatever whatever he felt he did it you know he did the best at 

510.68 511.64 B: [sigh] 

511.49 513.62 A: (( it )) 

513.28 514.42 B: there's 

514.63 523.24 B: i do- i don't know i think there's subtle difference as to what intelligence is in that um in that gump is 

523.45 525.74 B: um mindless 

526.12 530.50 B: you know um in a zen sense there is nobody there 

530.73 538.77 B: um which is a good thing in zen but something that i find a little problematic [laughter] you know uh i wanna deal with people who are there 

535.95 537.66 A: mhm 

539.27 540.40 A: right 

539.43 544.66 B: people who are actually connecting with what's happening rather than just sort of being um 

545.68 552.10 B: (( spacey and oh yeah everything's all just fine um )) 

552.80 556.70 B: but that's something that works a lot less well for me 

557.52 560.70 B: in terms of dealing with the world 

561.06 561.94 B: 'cause 

562.89 567.68 B: i find that the world requires a little more thought than that 

566.68 567.70 A: (( [noise] mm [mn] )) 

568.48 575.23 B: and i guess part of the point of the movie with forrest gump is the world does not require that thought 

575.33 576.43 B: and 

576.50 579.13 B: i reject that uh particular 

579.52 582.03 B: (( des- you know analysis )) 

582.98 591.38 A: well i don't think uh well i understand you know i think they had both of that 'cause of course with uh i guess when she winds up being his wife i think she took everything too you 

583.16 584.09 B: personally 

591.63 599.89 A: know what like 'cause she thought life was way too complex you know she did things where it was you know it was just too complex for her and she couldn't handle it and 

598.67 599.71 B: mhm
