204.49 205.67 A: yeah 

207.33 208.23 A: uh-huh 

207.78 212.81 B: and they start chirping and screeching and it's the weirdest sound you ever heard 

210.55 211.60 A: really 

212.70 221.25 A: really my my frog's really quiet i've probably only seen my frog about a dozen times it just hides out in this little uh rock that's in its terrarium 

219.53 220.44 B: right 

221.10 230.56 B: yeah but up here with all the animals that run round the crickets and the you know you might look out the back door and see a deer running through the yard 

229.79 231.44 A: yeah oh wow 

231.53 233.06 B: which is always cool 

232.57 235.81 A: we're in totally different parts of the universe [laughter] 

234.50 236.33 B: [laughter] exactly 

236.34 239.21 A: [laughter] what's the weather like there right now 

239.43 241.04 B: we're going through our 

241.25 243.12 B: umpteenth day of rain 

243.13 247.66 A: [lipsmack] yeah same here think the whole i think the whole world is raining right now 

244.44 245.29 B: we've had 

247.45 255.06 B: yeah but last year we were so dry from drought that uh we really every drop is a godsend here 

255.16 257.00 A: yeah so 

257.76 262.41 A: have you had any other pets are we supposed to continue talking about pets the whole time i think 

261.37 264.93 B: that's yeah that's our topic uh [laughter] ah 

262.99 263.95 A: okay 

264.32 271.53 A: all right more about pets so uh do you feed your cats uh dry food or or wet food 

265.64 266.81 B: yeah 

270.33 273.49 B: well the adult cats are on dry food because 

273.52 276.71 B: it cuts down their doing their business 

276.72 283.03 B: and our kitten the kitten's just about to the point where it's going to be switching over to dry food 

276.86 278.72 A: oh yeah 

282.61 284.00 A: yeah okay 

283.26 293.60 B: the kitten's so cool because he is you know our other cats are older so they like to lay around and be rubbed and stuff like that and the kitten loves to get into everything 

291.13 293.06 A: mhm 

293.57 294.61 A: yeah 

294.13 300.90 B: you know such a trip that cat will come running at you and he uh i was wearing shorts the other day he decided to climb my leg 

301.24 308.26 B: and uh it didn't feel too good to say the least but you know you got to love the animals you really do 

301.24 302.13 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

303.97 305.28 A: [laughter] 

307.56 314.20 A: yeah well no i i i'm also i'm also i have this phobia of about rodents uh 

313.83 314.66 B: yeah 

314.05 324.34 A: i don't know when it developed but i really don't like mice and uh living in the city y- you get a tendency to get mice so that's one good thing about having cats because 

319.55 321.20 B: yeah 

323.99 324.90 B: (( yeah )) 

324.28 331.84 A: every time that um every time there's i've tried to depend on exterminators or anything i always end up uh 

331.91 339.88 A: you know continuing to have a mouse problem [laughter] cats cats actually seem to work like once once you just have a cat then mice just stay away [noise] 

334.55 335.65 B: yeah 

339.22 344.39 B: yeah although one time uh when i was a kid i was still living at home with my parents 

344.10 345.15 A: yeah 

344.51 346.80 B: our cat caught a mouse 

346.60 347.45 A: uh-huh 

347.24 355.17 B: and he decided that he wanted to show off his trophy and i woke up middle of the night with a dead mouse in my bed so that 

353.31 356.73 A: that's gross i couldn't handle that [laughter] 

355.44 358.36 B: i tended to close my door after that [laughter] 

357.70 359.46 A: yeah that's a good idea 

359.51 363.50 A: well um what's your cats' names and your dog's name
