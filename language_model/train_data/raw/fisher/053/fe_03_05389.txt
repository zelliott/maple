0.45 1.67 A: hello 

1.55 3.08 B: hello 

2.85 4.11 A: this is jeff 

3.88 5.76 B: hey what's up my name's stephen 

5.80 6.99 A: hey stephen 

6.75 8.21 B: how you doing 

7.88 9.78 A: uh perjury i guess 

9.81 11.36 B: right right 

11.05 15.12 A: uh i don't know if i'd commit perjury even for a family member 

14.68 16.08 B: really 

15.45 16.82 A: it's uh 

17.83 20.32 A: it's a serious crime if you think about it 

20.64 22.31 B: i believe so too 

24.11 26.55 B: it i don't know it seems kind of tough though 

26.73 40.44 B: if your uh family member found themselves in a quite a sticky predicament and i don't know maybe their life was on the line you know they might go to jail forever it seems tough that you might want a try and do something to help 'em 

37.18 37.97 A: yeah 

41.07 43.75 A: as long as you can get away with it i mean that's 

43.49 48.43 B: yeah definitely if you think you're gonna get caught then of course you're not you have no chance 

47.51 48.26 A: i mean 

48.54 50.15 B: no reason to try 

50.21 53.20 A: if you knew if you were the only one that knew 

53.29 54.55 A: and uh 

58.00 59.68 A: what you said 

60.27 67.18 A: couldn't be disproved then who's who and as long as you never share it with anybody then who's to know the difference but 

66.46 71.58 B: right yeah it makes sense that you'd only try if you think you could get away with it 

71.95 76.15 B: i don't know it seems like commonsense is you want to do anything to help your family member 

77.08 78.40 A: yeah 

77.48 80.94 B: [mn] especially if they found themselves in a situation where 

81.42 82.72 B: they felt 

82.75 86.86 B: maybe uh that they weren't guilty or something like that you know 

86.67 88.45 A: yeah 

88.96 92.10 B: but if they did something if they did something completely 

89.09 90.29 A: yeah it's 

92.42 101.44 B: you know they just lost their mind and did something crazy like committed a violent act or something you might have to just i don't know maybe let 'em go 'cause uh 

101.86 103.88 B: maybe you disagree with what they did 

104.85 107.32 A: yeah that's true 

108.63 110.10 A: sometimes though 

110.89 112.11 A: but uh 

114.70 116.69 A: (( i don't know perjury )) 

117.63 120.14 A: it's a funny thing i guess uh 

123.70 124.27 A: (( [mn] )) 

124.46 131.60 A: quite kind a like the saying uh beauty's in the eye of the beholder you know so truth is in the eye of the the individual that's 

131.89 135.92 A: looking at it it comes from the fact that uh 

132.74 133.81 B: right 

137.68 145.58 A: you know i i've been involved in a situation where there was eight nine ten people stand on a corner and saw an automobile accident and uh 

144.35 145.14 B: oh 

145.66 150.96 A: we each told what we saw and there were several different versions so you know 

150.66 152.15 B: right 

153.39 159.84 A: no one was badly hurt in the accident but still that many different versions 

161.50 163.90 A: from my point of view you know 

166.55 172.64 A: [mn] that's that's why perjury is such a serious subje- [mn] you know touchy that way because 

172.76 182.85 A: i see something one way and does it make it a lie if i see tell it the way i saw it or does it make it perjury i don't know 

181.82 184.80 B: i see what you're saying yeah that makes a lot of sense 

185.52 187.87 B: it all depends on the way you view it 

187.78 189.47 A: yeah 

188.99 191.29 B: 'cause uh yeah it seems like um 

191.60 199.71 B: like your beliefs and um like maybe the way you were raised up is the will um affect the way that you see different situations 

199.41 201.09 A: yeah 

202.17 203.55 A: yeah it uh 

205.68 214.41 A: yeah your your background and your religious beliefs and your what are they morals and all that would have a bearing on 

212.68 217.33 B: yeah past experience past experiences stuff like that 

215.64 218.39 A: yeah yeah 

218.22 221.85 B: yeah it's real serious 'cause um that's pretty much what our um 

223.44 229.14 B: what our court system relies upon is people to tell the truth and with people 

228.97 240.09 B: not not telling what what really happened it it makes everyone's life a lot more difficult because then more people are put on the case to try and disprove what you're saying 

234.96 235.99 A: yeah 

240.38 242.67 B: i don't know it's tough 

241.54 243.22 A: yeah 

243.69 244.85 A: (( yeah it is )) 

243.73 250.37 B: i think it's funny because um like right now i don't know if you're a basketball fan but chris weber's on uh 

250.65 259.87 B: chris weber from the sacramento kings is is up for perjury in a case of uh accepting money in college and the funny thing about that is 

258.43 260.64 A: i think i saw that on the news i 

259.90 261.54 B: you saw that 

262.09 264.02 A: remember something about him 

263.46 272.48 B: yeah it's like pending right now but the funny thing is is that i think celebrities can pretty much get away with anything including perjury 

272.48 279.11 B: i don't know i i s- i can't see this multi million dollar basketball player going to jail for something like this 

279.26 281.21 A: yeah you'd figure he'd uh 

282.73 289.24 A: he'd be above that or realise that it was foolish to get involved in it especially if he's got a career ahead of him then 

287.06 287.70 B: (( yeah )) 

289.27 290.69 B: right 

291.24 294.96 B: i don't know i just can't see someone with that kind of uh 

295.30 304.40 B: status in our society going down for something like that even though it is a serious crime but he's a celebrity and i think that overshadows what he's done 

298.40 299.63 A: yeah 

304.65 306.37 A: yeah 

305.47 310.24 B: no one really knows his guilt or innocence but i don't know it just seemed like 

309.22 312.58 A: you know that was the same thing with o. j. simpson i mean uh 

313.39 316.48 A: i watched a lot of that on that 

317.20 322.35 A: court channel well whatever there was that they were showing i don't think they showed the whole 

320.27 321.39 B: right 

322.37 328.82 A: all the details but i couldn't have been on a jury and decide whe- whether he was guilty or not 

327.87 329.43 B: right you don't think so 

329.28 332.26 A: uh-uh i don't i don't think 

333.56 342.29 A: i don't think there was enough evidence presented well keeping in mind that his that his attorneys was blocking it as much of it as they could but 

341.70 343.48 B: right 

343.25 348.96 A: i don't think i could've decided whether he was guilty of murder or not on what i saw i mean 

347.04 347.91 B: i know 

350.11 363.20 A: they had that glove and they decided it didn't fit and then there was the big deal over the shoes those brumoli shoes or whatever it was he wore and they kept that out so 

359.72 361.00 B: right 

363.36 373.73 A: sometimes truth in the legal system isn't isn't exactly what it's after you're right about you're right about celebrities i do believe 

370.21 371.26 B: right 

374.56 376.47 A: you know sometimes 

378.49 381.38 A: if he was a guilty man he walked free i guess 

381.57 382.98 B: just seems so 

383.15 391.08 B: so bizarre if it wasn't this guy with so much evidence kind of in a way linked towards him if it wasn't him then who was it you know 

390.77 391.94 A: yeah 

391.32 394.63 B: who else who else is there as a suspect it 

394.89 396.50 B: just seems difficult 

396.63 398.33 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

396.87 399.54 B: yeah it's a tough situation definitely 

399.21 399.95 A: yeah 

401.59 405.64 A: and then there's a lot of the cases that go to c- trial that that uh 

405.86 413.12 A: i feel are open and shut cases you know the evidence presented definitely makes the man guilty but 

408.06 409.00 B: right 

414.82 416.28 A: yeah it's uh 

417.08 419.43 A: the truth is a touchy situation 

420.21 423.19 A: i don't think our uh our court system 

423.49 427.93 A: you know there's a lot of folks that get off with stuff that that aren't celebrities so 

428.16 442.70 A: and then there's a lot of 'em that go to jail that you know you see it on the news all the time the latest technology frees a man who's been in jail for a long time for rape that he didn't commit you know d. n. a. and all that proves he was innocent so 

437.62 438.53 B: right 

443.67 449.83 A: perjury and the truth in our legal system is an iffy situation i think 

450.87 454.90 B: but go yeah coming back to the the family thing i don't know 

455.49 463.71 B: yeah i think it depends on uh the entire situation if i would be willing to do that 'cause you know you commonsense and just 

463.84 468.25 B: your feelings inside say you would want to help someone that was close to your family you know 

467.63 470.41 A: oh definitely yeah you'd want to help somebody 

471.24 474.80 A: you definitely have to analyze the situation and figure out you know 

477.15 478.10 B: yeah 

477.21 482.10 A: whether it's uh whether it's plausible or whether it's not 

481.05 487.40 B: and it it's kind of sad though because you know people are gonna want to help 'em so they're gonna want to go against 

487.55 490.63 B: what the systems try to set up so 

489.89 490.66 A: (( yeah it'd )) 

491.38 496.68 A: be the same with a friend you know a a close friend uh um acquaintance i don't know if i 

497.28 500.77 A: but a close friend you know i don't know 

499.47 500.32 B: right 

501.25 507.93 A: i guess again like you said it would depend on you know the situation and what he's facing and why 

508.48 510.26 A: whether or not you'd uh 

511.84 514.71 A: whether or not you'd commit it or not 

514.94 518.81 B: so yeah i they've tried to do away with that by um 

519.10 522.18 B: by asking you when you um fill out your 

522.30 525.60 B: your form or whatever if you're gonna serve for jury duty 

525.37 539.26 B: if you know anyone [mn] involved with the case the judge anything like that so it seems like they're making strides to to try and do away with any any type of situation that that you're related and you have mixed feelings 

529.64 530.49 A: yeah 

539.19 541.09 B: so it seems like they're trying 

539.26 540.13 A: yeah 

541.06 542.78 A: yeah 

542.46 545.00 B: but it's not a foolproof system 

544.78 545.53 A: no 

545.73 551.12 A: i don't think there [mn] ever could be really a foolproof system but 

551.10 554.36 B: there al- there's always gonna be the loopholes in uh 

555.51 558.09 B: in every in every court case so 

557.93 559.59 A: yeah 

558.65 563.90 B: it just depends i don't know my opinion depends on how much money you have and what kind of lawyers you can get 

564.21 565.63 B: to get you off 

564.24 566.44 A: yeah see it 

568.61 574.84 A: that's why i i would imagine that perjury is such a serious situation to be fa- facing because 

576.77 578.06 A: the uh 

580.96 584.88 A: the system's based on everybody doing their job and telling the truth and if 

585.51 590.40 A: if one side isn't or doesn't then uh 

591.06 595.16 A: somebody that's guilty walks or somebody that's not guilty goes to jail 

598.47 599.89 B: definitely a serious situ-
