82.49 83.70 A: yeah 

85.44 94.32 B: 'cause then like you use all them people and that's just like telling the terrorists that you know [laughter] we're alerting you so now you gotta use ano- another tactic

155.58 165.71 A: not that they shouldn't but not that it's not important but i think they shouldn't like talk about what we're doing and like what we know and stuff like that you know what i mean 

164.53 168.04 B: yeah yeah it's like giving their strategy out 

166.11 167.92 A: like if if they're broad- 

168.41 182.70 A: if they're broadcasting like oh we have a tip about this going on and about that going on but we don't know like who's doing what or i don't know i mean if we know something's happened then we should probably just like kind a keep keep track of it and watch it yeah 

181.57 183.55 B: [noise] low profile 

183.27 186.65 A: and get that way we can get everybody everybody 

186.80 187.53 B: (( yeah )) 

186.93 189.50 A: as many people who are involved as possible 

189.25 198.66 B: yeah yeah that's exactly what i'm saying i don't think you know our president bush [lipsmack] and um [noise] colin powell and all these guys 

199.12 204.12 B: i don't know they're trying to prove a point by saying we got we're muscle we're strong and all this here 

203.95 204.95 A: yeah

301.11 309.21 A: why do they care like if we're alive or not you know what i mean like what's the point of like trying to kill like people who have nothing to do with anything 

304.59 305.44 B: (( hm )) 

309.35 310.96 B: (( yeah [mn] yeah [noise] )) 

310.08 320.57 A: like i i mean it's er like they can believe whatever they want you know in their beliefs and their gods and all that stuff that's fine but i just don't get why they think they have to come after us just because like 

316.25 317.45 B: yeah 

320.31 322.19 B: you know all of a sudden 

320.74 323.54 A: people don't think the same stuff that's stupid

364.96 368.64 A: i don't know about it it's all a big like i mean 

368.65 372.87 A: you can't we don- don't want them to be like 

373.32 374.39 A: into 

374.67 378.70 A: into like our privacy and stuff like that you know like 

378.76 387.66 A: knowing what we're doing and like i don't know keep like and having lots of records on us and like on r- every day citizens and stuff like that 

387.12 390.83 B: (( mm yeah that's what the c._i._a. and f._b._i. are using them for )) 

387.81 389.25 A: you know because 

390.14 391.75 A: yeah 

392.65 399.20 B: i wonder how how how extensive is that can they tell who who like all right people come 

399.33 409.53 B: from another country in here can they tell what they what they've done or anything do they do check like they do checking on us but don't do checking on other [laughter] people that come in 

407.23 408.13 A: yeah 

408.89 410.07 A: yeah 

409.59 411.52 B: that's stupid you know 

411.04 411.94 A: well 

412.29 426.75 A: just like people come in from cuba and as as long as they get as long as they touch land you know that's why they let them stay well they could just terrorists could just go to cuba and then like ride it over here and if they go on land they'd be in and there'd be nothing we could do about it 

414.61 415.73 B: oh yeah 

418.38 419.32 B: yeah 

423.60 424.77 B: (( and there you go )) 

426.20 427.94 B: easy access 

427.89 429.14 A: yeah 

428.55 431.72 B: yeah that's a good point there uh you know 

431.84 440.97 B: i don't know i- it's like a complicated thing but it's also the like i said the government like you said they could go to cuba and come it's like go to cuba 

440.96 447.05 B: wait a minute what's is a cuba is the turnstile you really want to go there first and then you can get in here 

446.82 449.19 A: yeah people really do that 

447.27 448.36 B: well 

448.44 458.39 B: you know why not check these people out thoroughly we had terrorists here two years ago they were sitting in miami denver and then like for months 

458.20 469.63 B: for months and then they wanted to take flying courses and all this never was checked out thoroughly now you got chemical warfare and these guys they can come here go to school 

462.53 463.35 A: yeah 

464.11 464.96 A: (( yeah )) 

470.30 474.65 B: (( and you know and you know you a chemistry student can do just anything )) 

474.61 475.65 A: yeah 

475.07 478.46 B: yeah you get a degree in chemistry you're loaded you're 

477.88 480.94 A: (( the internet you can just go on the internet and find out what you want )) 

479.74 482.51 B: right right they don't even check those things 

483.20 486.01 B: you know it's uh shoo oh well 

483.69 484.58 A: (( but it's )) 

485.37 495.13 A: like that it's often like that and that you don't you really want that to happen i mean 'cause it's all like a question of how much freedom do we have doesn't mean we don't want 

492.64 496.05 B: uh-huh the the invasion of privacy 

495.28 500.01 A: to yeah you don't want them to say you can only do this you can only do this and say that 

500.03 504.28 A: i mean because then what i mean it'd be like totally 

503.73 505.32 B: [laughter] 

504.52 507.88 A: (( that's what america's all about is that people can do whatever you want )) 

506.07 508.87 B: yeah our first amendment there [laughter] shoo 

508.19 514.25 A: yeah it's what the whole thing that's what the whole country is and if they stop that then it'd just be like oh no
