3.82 4.95 B: nice to meet ya 

4.72 5.71 A: um 

5.85 7.79 A: well i'm from georgia how about you 

7.67 9.76 B: oh new england up north 

9.79 18.14 A: [laughter] everybody on this project seems to be from new england [laughter] really [laughter] last time it was somebody from the bronx 

12.36 13.21 B: yeah 

13.63 15.04 B: [laughter] 

17.94 19.82 B: yeah wow 

18.39 20.27 A: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

21.26 23.72 A: so so how's it today and 

21.57 27.86 B: well you're you're you're the fartherest south actually i think ah my my last two were um ah pennsylvania 

27.79 28.77 A: ah 

28.34 29.22 B: (( yeah [laughter] oh )) 

28.80 31.32 A: well it's a university of pennsylvania study 

30.72 33.05 B: yeah so i figure [laughter] 

32.20 33.96 A: [laughter] that means you're done today 

33.78 34.71 B: (( ah )) 

34.29 35.84 A: that means you're done today 

35.29 36.72 B: i guess so what 

36.19 37.73 A: [laughter] 

38.19 40.27 A: so what was the topic again 

39.73 45.27 B: ah minimum wage do we feel that the increase to five twenty five is ah sufficient 

46.94 49.98 A: well you want to go first [laughter] 

48.11 49.48 B: [laughter] 

49.91 59.24 B: oh gees i haven't i haven't um got much thoughts on that other than ah well making minimum wage ah you know pretty much stinks 

59.17 59.92 A: [laughter] 

59.29 63.94 B: [laughter] if you have to you know like that that pretty much stinks but i guess it's 

62.37 65.47 A: yeah making minimum wage is not much fun right 

64.46 69.33 B: yeah like like so so i guess the question is almost facetious it depends on whom you ask 

69.35 75.96 B: if you ask somebody who's making minimum wage is that sufficient the answer would probably be heck no if you ask a you know if you ask a c._e._o. 

73.72 74.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

75.97 83.46 B: who ah runs the whole enterprise [laughter] he'll probably say oh of course it is because you know they've got costs so 

83.66 90.08 A: well i would say n- not if we're making minimum wage or paying it that the whole idea of a minimum wage is ridiculous 

87.16 87.99 B: yeah 

90.06 91.66 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

91.07 97.02 A: i mean if i'm willing to work for some bozo for two dollars an hour who's the government telling me i can't hm 

97.53 111.97 B: right yeah but then then again well well well here's the catch right um what about um ah waiters waitresses that sort of thing um they make sometimes less than minimum wage and then make then make the rest of their wages in tips 

111.83 112.74 A: yes 

112.47 118.83 B: so that that would i suppose um you know like ah argue your case that you just brought up 

118.26 123.09 A: but they aren't making enough in tips the employer is required to make up the difference 

122.85 137.32 B: well that is true yeah um yeah [laughter] i personally think that i mean 'cause this is sort of the okay extreme capitalism on one side would say well total laissez faire let's get forget about any kind of governmental 

137.33 148.41 B: input into saying 'well you must pay a minimum wage or not' um on the one hand versus a socialist system you know on the other hand which has regulated everybody's price 

148.37 155.08 B: i don't know this seems to me a sort of a m- a mild concession you know a um [mn] 

155.36 162.58 B: an attempt for the government to do something which is socially good you know by setting a minimum wage 

162.76 164.83 B: so that those who 

163.20 164.00 A: (( yeah yes )) 

165.25 177.58 B: are not able you know whether it's um capability or just the jobs are not available geographically where they are to earn wages in excessive of wh- minimum wage at least they're guaranteed as much 

172.04 172.68 A: (( yeah )) 

177.83 178.85 B: (( i don't know )) 

178.06 187.24 A: yeah a lot of economists believe and don't s- i don't know how they make the argument but it's convincing that the minimum wage creates some un- unemployment 

182.32 183.02 B: yeah 

187.69 192.34 A: that there would be more people employed without a minimum wage law than there are with one 

188.23 188.94 B: i would 

192.87 193.85 B: well 

193.15 199.37 A: but you can't live really too if you can't really live on five fifteen an hour how could you live on three twenty five an hour [mn] 

198.44 204.51 B: exactly yeah so so so that's the that's the argument it's like okay well which one is better 

204.53 207.90 B: there's okay because okay what you've said actually is probably 

208.18 214.20 B: a big issue because then the government has to pay the the the cost of unemployment in terms of benefits 

214.23 220.04 B: you know unemployment um benefits welfare etcetera there's that incurred cost it's all 

219.08 223.79 A: well they don't have to fifty years ago there was no such thing 

223.35 230.44 B: yes but now aren't they um bound to you know the way the law is now like today 

225.62 226.39 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

230.80 238.56 A: not like a they can repeal it all at any time they would never get re-elected in their lives but they could [laughter] 

230.83 232.12 B: aren't they bound to 

237.33 247.71 B: yeah i guess i guess they could but the way it is now they they do incur the costs because people will go on welfare and the government will typically say you know well okay here's somebody on welfare 

247.50 248.54 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

247.84 256.29 B: um and i know okay yeah they slashed the welfare rolls when clinton was in office but still that's still a lot of people who if they 

256.65 257.53 B: you know 

257.17 258.19 A: yeah 

257.52 270.35 B: as you said okay well okay if you have a minimum wage then it means that these people then will not get a job at three twenty five and maybe they can't find a job with a five twenty five because that's already gone to somebody else 

270.14 274.50 B: so they wind up being unemployed the other thing is there's also the incurred cost of crime 

274.97 275.80 A: yeah 

275.20 285.86 B: um you know they can't find work can't find anything to eat you get a miserable pay type of situation [laughter] and they commit crime to get you know sustenance to live 

282.11 282.74 A: (( mm )) 

286.71 287.87 A: yes they do 

287.63 289.00 B: survival tactics 

289.19 293.38 A: right do anything to get food in their mouths hm 

289.63 290.72 B: um 

292.05 294.31 B: yes yeah 

294.47 300.14 B: but i don't know i mean like okay is is minimum wage of um five fifteen an hour um 

300.42 302.86 B: you know like it does does it really help 

303.74 305.00 B: i don't know 

304.86 306.03 A: it doesn't 

305.09 308.89 B: i've never been on i've never been on the minimum wage so i don't know 

308.53 309.17 A: (( hm )) 

308.96 316.83 B: i i don't want to like i don't want to talk and say something that'll be plainly ah insulting to somebody who has been on you know what i mean 

309.52 310.51 A: me neither 

316.41 317.84 A: yeah 

316.93 318.19 B: [laughter] 

318.58 327.17 A: most people aren't even on minimum wage and what was it a few years ago minimum wage was around like three seventy five or something 

321.34 322.47 B: (( yeah )) 

326.44 329.77 B: something like that something like that yeah 

329.28 338.69 A: ah minimum wage here has grown faster than inflation in the last few years they're making more now than they used to by government by just by government edict 

338.64 344.40 A: you have to pay more in real terms now for in for labor than you used to twenty years' ago 

343.80 357.76 B: mhm right right right i think that well from the although if you look at it this way like okay skilled labor has tended to increase way more than minimum wage ever has 

350.34 351.23 A: if you look 

357.50 359.49 A: right right 

358.10 367.66 B: right so in terms of the drain like the labor costs to any corporation um this is not clearly the where the money is going 

367.69 370.03 B: the money is clearly going to the skilled labor 

370.11 370.96 A: (( yes )) 

370.40 373.53 B: and pretty much is actually going to the um 

373.64 377.73 B: (( management executive bonuses is really where it's [laughter] going actually )) 

377.13 378.79 A: [laughter] too much there 

378.16 391.86 B: [laughter] so so so that's really what needs to be you know that's the hole that needs to be plugged rather than the minimum wage but then again i mean i don't know like you could go to the socialist extreme in which case you wind up with a country like um 

383.84 385.48 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

392.19 403.40 B: naturally you you wind up with a country like like romania like where they had like zero percent unemployment but you know they had lift operators you know this guy who's job is just to operate the l- you know the the elevator 

392.80 394.49 A: well germany they're 

403.16 404.24 A: yeah 

403.39 411.12 B: just push the button and he gets paid and he's technically employed but if you think about it you know i mean you know from a human 

405.70 406.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

410.04 412.82 A: i can push my own button [laughter] 

411.41 416.64 B: exactly from a human resources perspective that's a wasted job it's a drain on the economy 

417.10 423.15 A: what are for businesses what germany has they have like a i think their minimum wage is ten twenty euros an hour 

423.23 426.12 A: unemployment's about eleven percent 

425.61 426.92 B: mhm 

426.59 428.92 A: (( the and welfare )) 

429.16 441.07 A: but you have to have it about welfare and all that is if you're making a living and you're employed and doing fine is it your can then get actually the government really they requiring 

434.30 435.08 B: (( mm mhm mhm )) 

441.21 448.30 A: not pleading to your sense of surety but requiring you to pay for that person that's living on the streets and doesn't have a job 

448.34 449.96 B: right 

450.11 451.02 B: yeah 

450.45 454.40 A: so there are some are there's some that argue the whole system is just stealing 

455.01 458.42 A: charitable people yes but to force you 

459.38 474.26 B: it's strange i mean it's like okay yeah i i i see what i see what you're getting at it's sort of you know like okay should you be required to do acts of charity or should it come from your heart and do you do it voluntarily to the person who well especially because you know there's so many scams ah nowadays or whatever 

467.38 468.39 A: (( right yeah )) 

473.82 475.00 A: (( yeah mm )) 

474.23 481.77 B: whether it's the person who's actually scamming for cash on the side of the road and you know this particular person who happened to know a scam and you versus another one who you may not know 

481.91 493.62 B: versus somebody else maybe a a distant relative who is in some kind of need and you know what that need is and you substantiate it that this is the scam but they have legitimate need it'd be better to give to that person 

491.65 492.53 A: yeah 

493.83 496.23 A: yes people going take here are their own relatives 

495.79 499.58 B: yeah unfortunately like up north here 

499.69 500.50 A: yeah 

499.88 501.65 B: you tend to have 

502.14 503.26 B: um 

503.26 506.39 B: non close knit family ties 

506.39 516.47 B: you tend to have people who wind up you know falling through the cracks socially first from their family they've got no means of family support and then 

516.34 521.83 B: they wind up having to fall on to on to welfare as the as the last recourse 

522.09 524.91 B: that happens commonly enough up north 

525.29 527.46 B: um so 

526.15 531.10 A: i guess the difference is down here in the south the families typically are closer 

531.29 543.12 B: yeah i've heard a lot about about that i've i've never spent much time in the south but ah i've you know like everybody who i've ever talked to you know if i hear who's from the south always comments on that 

537.16 538.00 A: [mn] 

542.59 544.38 A: yeah well 

543.12 548.29 B: so that's a big a big difference is the factor which needs to change up north is 

547.61 549.46 A: yeah 

548.33 552.42 B: yeah i think i think that's what's what needs to be fixed first actually 

553.22 562.26 A: and so how do you fix it the government can't come in and say all right you have to have you got to knit closer to your families and you have to ah support them [laughter] 

555.87 558.05 B: no you can't let just let love [laughter] 

561.58 566.11 B: yeah you can't you can't you can't legislate love you know [laughter] 

566.20 568.76 A: (( [laughter] yes [laughter] )) 

567.11 574.85 B: you can't force people to love one another and get along and help each other and you know like your family you can't you can't legislate that 

575.65 577.93 A: no and that's 

578.57 590.63 A: i'm for that we we southerners we're old fashioned we don't think anything ought to change and that's how it's always been if you have a family member who's house burned down like mine did in january [mn] and your 

584.07 585.07 B: right 

590.83 599.09 A: and all your five and sixth and seventh cousins came in and helped you [laughter] not as bad as the amish 'cause we're actually talking on telephones but 

594.32 596.10 B: right right 

598.36 599.89 B: (( right [laughter] ))
