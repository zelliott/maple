80.08 81.02 B: uh-huh 

80.76 89.02 A: yes uh but basically they they would go out fishing and bring the bring the lot with them and uh basic- basically they would go swimming you know

96.50 98.85 B: kind of like a rottweiler mix 

98.27 99.01 A: (( mm )) 

99.24 106.71 B: but he pretty much stays on his chain out in the yard and it about once a day we one of the boys takes him for a walk 

106.28 107.40 A: (( oh okay ))

143.60 145.44 B: mhm 

145.93 150.79 B: i guess there's a real problem with overpopulation of dogs and cats 

152.45 155.78 A: mm i don't i don't know if i don't know if it's overpopulating i mean i 

155.90 159.80 A: but uh basically where they lived they couldn't have too many

245.42 251.54 B: i believe in taking care of 'em and giving 'em attention but not uh 

251.58 253.86 B: like if the cat got sick 

253.29 255.10 A: (( mhm ))

258.00 261.56 B: you know get the cat uh treated 

260.98 264.79 A: oh yeah i know the whole house has to come first 

264.51 272.72 B: y- right right yeah food shelter that kind of stuff we we don't have a high income so we can't be doing that 

272.06 273.14 A: yeah i know 

273.74 283.69 A: same here but luckily e- luckily everything else they provide for first i mean you know so that that comes at the very end but luckily they're able to provide for it

326.29 332.19 B: the only thing really she likes the dogs and the cats better than i do i like the rodents myself 

331.78 332.71 A: (( ah )) 

332.30 337.31 B: 'cause they're confined we have a new home and i don't want any 

337.48 340.74 B: unwanted stuff on the floor [laughter] 

339.46 348.92 A: oh i understand that oh i know i know another ah family th- a friend of mine ah who just put in uh floors i think just for that reason 

348.99 350.11 B: mhm 

349.50 358.56 A: you know they had carpets and i think they ripped it all out and just layed down ah it's the equivalent of linoleum it looks like wood but uh just for that reason so that's why you know 

354.86 356.58 B: mhm 

358.73 361.12 A: the dog doesn't get mess uh doesn't uh 

360.23 362.35 B: just to accommodate their pets uh 

362.08 365.26 A: well that and i think they like the floors it looks very nice too 

367.03 367.92 B: (( [sigh] )) 

367.83 375.76 A: but the thing is it was rather expensive for an older house um and you know everyone's always asking are you sure you should have done that oh yeah i'm here 

373.75 375.11 B: are you still there 

377.53 384.70 A: yeah everyone's always saying that they ah they probably shouldn't have done that because it was an older house and probably shouldn't have been invested in like that 

384.79 387.27 A: but they they enjoy it 

387.80 391.63 A: now this poor dog can't stop whenever ah whenever she's running around 

392.31 398.98 A: [laughter] they have a little ah that this family has a tiny little whippet uh basically a miniature greyhound 

399.91 402.21 A: and she's always running into something 

411.43 415.91 A: but luckily they were you know luckily they opened up the backdoor and they let him run around in the backyard 

415.33 417.59 B: hello are you still there robert 

415.98 416.82 A: yeah

464.63 466.66 B: we do enjoy our pets 

466.75 467.93 B: uh 

468.52 479.80 B: as far the the breeding the gerbils we really have a lot of fun with that because you can watch their different uh behavior and the different foods that they'll eat 

479.87 491.26 B: uh the different ways that they'll they will interact they have a like a social thing like you can tell who's the head one 

491.36 493.21 B: in a certain cage 

493.42 498.43 B: uh you can uh with the hamsters are a little different the hamsters 

498.54 503.94 B: once the female hamster gives birth sometimes the male will will become uh 

504.00 509.39 B: unwanted we have we we've got one separated right now because of that reason 

510.47 519.25 B: the female will start uh chasing him and he this one jumped right out we had to put him in a cage by itself [laughter] 

510.52 511.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

520.37 522.31 B: so uh 

524.25 528.82 B: anyway uh we're m- we're mainly into the smaller pets 

529.25 542.85 B: i don't care much for birds because we've had so many birds that have died i just don't a a a bird is just not like something you wanna pet also i've been bitten by birds before 

542.81 545.27 B: i didn't care for that too much either 

547.50 548.79 B: (( now )) 

547.59 549.05 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

549.99 559.79 B: the other pets that i have ha- i've ha- had a tarantula but nobody else liked it so f- when it died i just didn't get another one 

561.08 565.77 B: and let's see i think one time i had a s- python 

566.44 574.45 B: and it was the same way uh you'd bring a visitor and they'd be scared of it and they wouldn't wanna come back to your home 

574.99 579.13 B: so i'm just into more the cuddly type pets right now 

581.21 583.05 B: robert are you gone or
