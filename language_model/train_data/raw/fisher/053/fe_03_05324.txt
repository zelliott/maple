189.78 192.62 B: seventy two to seventy eight 

193.51 196.99 B: [lipsmack] it seems like that was before 

197.10 201.63 B: they got a good quarterback and they s- 

201.81 212.88 B: they may i forget the name of the guy but he was an old fella who started making his name kicking field goals uh uh 

212.05 213.24 A: jim turner 

214.34 216.31 B: (( towards the end )) 

215.59 223.08 A: yeah it was we had back then we had charlie johnson and jim turner were the quarterbacks and jim turner is the one who went into the field goal kicking 

223.03 231.02 A: and was a straight on kicker and at one point in time had the longest field goal in the n._f._l. tied for it at least before dempsey made his kick 

231.07 239.22 A: and um then they got uh craig morton in the seventy six season which let them into the seventy seven super bowl 

239.11 242.40 B: mm right and then john elway came [mn] 

241.82 244.38 A: elway came in eighty two yep 

245.03 248.22 A: and played for all those years before he finally quit 

248.19 262.12 A: he was the one of the ones like you were talking about that uh granted when he was first drafted he didn't stay with his original team um because he didn't want to play n baltimore but beyond that he stayed with the broncos his entire career 

261.98 262.77 B: yeah 

262.77 270.26 A: and uh that's one of the things that i've been able to follow through sports all the way through is i love my teams 

270.15 283.54 A: and i'll root for the guys that were good on my team even when they go to other places um but i still even though there's the free agency in the movement i still i i i'm a huge team follower for all the colorado teams that are out there 

284.29 294.32 B: yeah well i i've got a daughter and son in law and two grandchildren in denver and it seems like every time i go 

294.34 295.24 B: uh 

295.94 301.65 B: [lipsmack] out there they're either going to a baseball game or a football game my 

301.63 310.97 B: my son in law really likes it and usually gets a season ticket with some friends that they share and uh 

310.37 312.37 A: (( mhm )) 

312.37 326.93 B: there's still nothing like going out to the to the park to watch the games uh th- the t._v. is great for seeing it in detail and especially now i 

312.52 313.72 A: to get 

318.53 319.84 A: yeah 

326.79 330.31 B: haven't started to do it yet but i know 

330.17 336.45 B: there are people that capture things on the t._v. right directly 

336.28 346.80 B: into the computer or on to a [noise] c._d. rom or a d._v._d. even i guess nowadays and um 

346.57 355.83 B: you know you get the best shots that way but it's not like having a beer and a hotdog at the baseball stadium [laughter] 

355.17 356.69 A: that's for sure 

356.84 363.15 A: it's a when the rockies first began playing i went to new york and to the shea stadium for their first game ever and 

362.97 376.14 A: i sat in some really good seats and you're right it's there's watching t._v.'s great for the replays and the color and you get comfortable in your chair but sitting at a ball game doesn't matter how bad the seats are it's always ten times better 

375.79 376.61 B: mm 

377.12 378.27 A: always 

380.17 395.14 B: yeah and [sigh] a- as a a youngster going to ebbets field with my dad or friends uh i can remember some really fantastic games i don't know whether 

395.28 402.12 B: what it was but it just seemed like as a teenager there there was uh 

403.57 406.83 B: much deeper involvement in 

407.87 422.57 B: uh maybe it was because i was young and didn't have other worries [laughter] you know but i can remember the dodgers and the giants uh having playoffs and uh 

422.76 428.68 B: uh going to the stadium i remember one time the dodgers were 

428.87 438.38 B: uh they were like down ten to nothing and they came back to ten to nine and uh 

438.40 441.71 B: some fantastic catch 

442.02 451.06 B: closed 'em out and [laughter] they lost the game but they had come back and they had almost gotten it [laughter] [noise] 

450.46 452.29 A: (( yeah )) 

452.44 457.98 A: and you can't you can never get the excitement over the t._v. like you can being at the ballpark 

458.06 471.66 A: with the way the fans react and and y- up close like that you could see the players and the way they just they get so much more into the game by their actions and their movements and you don't pick that up on t._v. 'cause you don't see 'em all at once 

471.30 473.06 B: right 

472.52 477.37 A: yeah it's a i i i don't get to go as much as i'd like and i do miss going to the ballpark 

477.45 479.14 A: and getting to see games 

479.85 482.67 A: [noise] we've got 

480.29 482.37 B: (( right [mn] )) 

482.84 485.46 A: some new ballparks going in here in arizona 

485.39 498.42 A: with the diamondbacks and the new stadium going in and then the hockey arena going in so we got some real state of the art stuff here to go see and uh it's it's quite nice to get out when you get a chance but 

498.43 502.38 A: i could go to every cardinals game this you know each year 'cause they never sell out 

502.41 505.92 A: it's there are always open seats for those games 

508.03 511.57 A: so we're looking forward to the new stadium to see what it's going to be like 

508.69 510.49 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

512.47 516.32 B: where where's it going to be located 

515.28 521.64 A: they're building both the new hockey arena and the new football stadium out in glendale in the northwest part of town 

523.51 528.26 A: so they're getting out away from downtown phoenix and also away from the tempe area 

528.87 542.12 B: oh okay yeah it's hard to figure out some places they stick pretty much to downtown and other places they uh they go out and around 

542.83 552.41 B: uh i i think you kn- in denver when they built the new stadium there it made a tremendous difference in 

552.44 565.83 B: the redevelopment of that whole local area it had been just the warehouses and slums and very down and then 

565.80 569.92 B: when they built the stadium and people started to come in they 

570.17 571.14 B: (( [noise] re- )) 

571.18 577.28 B: renovated uh some of the warehouses made 'em into big restaurants and dance 

577.24 587.91 B: halls and it just seemed like it started a a wave of reconstruction that was really good for the city 

587.46 599.89 A: yeah that lower downtown area when the new ballpark went in place just like you said changed overnight those dramatical lofts that got built and all the stuff around that the the ballpark really infused the whole process 

599.39 599.89 B: (( mm ))
