71.63 77.02 A: mm uh yeah i heard his show was pretty funny i never actually got to got on and seeing it though 

76.47 80.22 B: uh-huh well i'm sure he's had an h._b._o. special or something

95.65 96.64 A: [laughter]

99.87 100.77 A: oh 

100.40 101.55 B: [mn] but uh 

100.84 105.27 A: well they have that thing that came on channel four for the comedy shows you saw that thing 

104.67 106.90 B: no i didn't i heard about that though 

106.37 118.36 A: well i didn't really like that show 'cause they had like each comic they had like like a nine second show and then they edited most of it out and showed like the judges what they thought so it was kind of boring 

118.37 119.96 B: yeah well it's 

120.85 125.28 B: those shows don't really mean much i guess it's all hype that's all it is uh-huh 

124.75 125.55 A: (( mm )) 

125.56 132.93 A: but i don't really see like like what's really risky i mean it depends on who the comedian is i guess 

133.42 138.08 A: i can't really say i haven't really seen like something i'd say like oh that's going too far really 

137.71 140.63 B: yeah bad taste meaning uh i guess um 

140.64 144.80 B: ethnic uh allusions or um 

145.93 147.13 B: [lipsmack] i don't know i 

147.28 152.83 B: you don't see you don't really see it on um mainstream television you'd have to go to the uh cable to see 

152.45 154.40 A: yeah 

153.04 155.87 B: pretty uh uh racy stuff but um 

156.26 158.52 B: i mean it's it's seinfield's about as 

158.72 161.00 B: much as i watch comedy 

160.48 163.50 A: [laughter] yeah i watched a replay of that show too 

163.05 165.13 B: that's sort of a classic uh 

165.17 167.13 B: you know a definition of um 

168.20 174.77 B: just you know inane situations that no you wouldn't normally uh see hu- humor in you 

174.57 176.55 A: mhm 

174.82 178.08 B: know they magnify it so much and uh 

178.43 181.52 A: just like [mn] doing normal things in your life 

180.91 185.36 B: right i guess if we all did that it would be a better uh you'd have a better outlook 

185.09 187.10 A: yeah 

186.18 188.01 B: see things for what they uh 

188.97 198.69 B: you know the gravity of things that that you know compared to what uh stress and and uh competition makes uh makes life a little 

199.35 200.26 B: (( uh [mn] )) 

202.18 203.01 A: (( mm )) 

202.23 203.58 B: wasted you know 

205.59 209.66 A: uh yes i see what you're saying but like um 

205.76 206.45 B: (( mhm )) 

210.59 212.85 A: like 

213.40 215.71 A: i don't know like 

216.74 219.91 A: so far some nothing's really gone to 

219.74 227.92 A: me [mn] to make me go surprised or anything but like a lot of things it depends like what a comedian is and like if he 

227.73 234.78 A: there's just like some stuff i guess a lot of people would be offended if somebody else said stuff about that 

233.50 236.21 B: yeah well that's [mn] you know like profane language is 

234.68 243.28 A: like if itali- like if somebody wasn't italian told italian jokes about italian people they'd get offended uh things like that 

243.47 249.03 A: i don't know it's i guess i think it's like a double standard though for white people it s- it seems like 

248.97 260.49 A: a comic can say stuff about white people and not have to be white but a white person can't say r- really say anything about other races and not really get got get in trouble over a lot of times 

260.10 260.94 B: (( mhm mm )) 

261.60 263.70 B: yeah i guess for me it would be um 

263.90 267.71 B: dirty sexual humor or or profane language you know that's 

268.12 269.66 B: that's about my uh 

270.55 271.93 B: governing uh 

272.70 279.43 B: tool that i use i i everything else is pretty uh pretty tame compared to that [mn] 

277.34 282.68 A: yeah i haven't really seen that many things out like jumped out at me 

282.45 283.60 B: mhm 

284.39 286.67 A: as real extreme for me so 

286.43 290.06 B: what's life like in the bronx there is that kind of funny sometimes [mn] 

291.21 299.50 A: yeah it's pretty plain it's it's good but is it you live in [mn] is pittsburgh like a regular city 'cause like i know like my cousin who lives up in 

294.04 294.83 B: is it 

299.44 306.97 A: stamford in there's no like big transportation if you don't have a car you're not going anywhere is it like that over there 

303.52 304.23 B: uh-huh 

306.37 308.59 B: no we have uh well we have um 

309.32 313.31 B: we have a good bus system that's a little low on funding right now so they're 

310.80 311.85 A: oh 

312.80 323.34 A: yeah 'cause i know like in connecticut if you don't have a car [mn] you're basically done you can't do anything you have to like drive your car just to go to the like the supermarket and everything 

317.86 318.56 B: (( mm )) 

323.69 327.18 B: well the bronx is that that's uh is that a residential or 

326.84 329.26 A: yeah it's a city it's in new york 

329.73 332.12 B: that's pretty uh does the subway go out there 

331.59 333.51 A: mhm 

332.33 333.28 B: oh okay 

333.61 337.78 A: so it's pretty easy if you want to get anything you don't need to like have a car or anything 

337.22 338.50 B: mhm 

339.20 342.33 B: yeah i um talking about comedy i um 

343.60 346.33 B: frasier i watch once in a while but um 

346.30 351.72 A: yeah i [mn] i never watched that show it seemed kind of boring to me i never got really into it 

351.15 356.36 B: yeah i really um i'm not yeah i really don't watch sitcoms or uh dramas on t._v. i'm more um 

356.21 361.63 A: yeah i watch the simpsons i thought that show was funny you ever seen that 

357.01 358.29 B: public television 

358.97 359.97 B: oh really 

360.53 369.54 B: yeah i've se- i've seen that i might watch the other one once in a while you know the other spin off what do they call that with the the middle aged guys that [mn]

375.76 380.45 B: they're not they're [mn] really not too much on for me i'm uh i'm more public television and uh 

381.38 383.21 B: classical music uh 

383.24 384.71 B: ethnic music 

384.77 386.87 B: so i don't watch too much t._v. 

387.07 387.93 A: (( mm )) 

388.08 390.93 B: it's just a it's a br- it's a drain for the brain you know 

392.19 395.94 B: you could be [mn] could be doing other things creative things 

392.38 394.21 A: yeah 

395.21 399.36 A: mhm so you like band or something 

399.17 402.84 B: uh well i doodle and i play instruments and 

403.39 406.44 A: oh [laughter] i don't play any instruments or anything yet so 

405.84 410.28 B: well you can it's never too late you just get pick something up 

410.30 411.14 A: (( mm )) 

412.25 415.08 B: you know you don't even have to take lessons you just teach yourself 

415.16 415.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

418.13 427.19 A: so you seen any other shows like you thought was funny like the only like regular shows i like is in the cartoon that i found funnier like seinfield 

426.68 428.08 B: mhm 

427.50 429.17 A: and 

428.55 432.97 B: you know that would make a good cartoon i'm surprised they haven't done that and haven't 

433.05 439.48 A: what seinfield uh i think it would be [mn] i like it the way it is if they made it a cartoon i think it'd be kind a weird 

433.88 435.13 B: yeah 

439.17 445.02 B: yeah well i guess they don't they're they're probably so sick of it they you know they wouldn't want to come back and just do the voices anyway 

444.26 446.24 A: yeah 

445.13 449.11 B: i think they're gonna do reunion shows like every ten years or something 

448.72 460.85 A: yeah 'cause like everyone's [mn] everyone who left that show [mn] everyone except for like the main person jerry seinfield tried to keep going [mn] their career and it all failed for basically all of 'em yeah 

458.34 459.51 B: right 

460.40 465.96 B: except um george there he hasn't really done uh he does broadway and 

465.75 468.76 A: he does i thought i just knew he did the chicken commercials [mn] 

468.40 472.51 B: yeah he does song and dance stuff and [mn] he's pretty versatile 

472.08 476.19 A: he does i can't really see him doing like song and dance on broadway 

475.69 477.55 B: yeah i think he does that stuff 

476.97 477.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

478.24 479.34 B: but uh 

478.32 479.88 A: (( mm that's weird )) 

479.98 481.56 A: so what what was he in 

480.17 480.73 B: (( yeah )) 

481.75 483.05 A: (( you know what he was in )) 

481.86 483.64 B: oh geez i don't know 

483.65 487.20 B: i really he was on he he he did a a television uh 

487.63 492.10 B: show about uh p. t. barnum i think he played p. t. barnum or 

491.49 494.21 A: oh yeah i saw yeah i saw him in a few movies 

493.79 495.41 B: or some kind of toy 

495.43 497.12 B: like the um [lipsmack] 

497.63 499.06 B: (( um not the lion )) 

499.19 500.10 B: king 

499.49 501.60 A: oh i think he was in pinocchio 

501.85 503.84 B: yeah he's he's pretty successful 

503.90 506.59 B: it was him seinfield then him and then 

506.90 509.55 B: i think the girl and then kramer that's basically 

509.96 512.39 B: (( [cough] the pecking order of success [mn] you'd )) 

512.35 513.22 A: (( mm )) 

512.56 515.35 B: think kramer would have better luck but i 

516.84 530.29 A: i would like [mn] it's weird though like all those shows like they're that do real good i never really watch 'em until they come into syndication it's pretty funny like seinfield i never actually watched it when it was on n._b._c. i just watched it when it came into syndication 

521.95 522.84 B: (( don't know )) 

530.24 537.37 B: right it started up pretty slow uh for a few years there and then it i think it changed direction a little bit got a little crazier 

538.77 539.97 B: (( but um mm )) 

539.48 550.96 A: same thing with like i don't know i heard like everybody loves raymond was good but i never really watched it either and it's still on now and i don't watch it i watched like about two episodes it seemed all right to me 

549.99 552.35 B: yeah i've i've watched that a couple times i 

552.61 553.91 B: nothing really 

554.66 557.96 B: you know um sucks me in so um 

558.23 560.33 B: i habituated to it but uh 

561.63 565.71 B: i don't know i think that friends is really overrated i can't stand them 

565.49 566.28 A: (( mm )) 

566.24 567.95 B: you know the show friends i 

567.45 569.36 A: yeah 

567.98 572.10 B: don't know that's just too sickening sickening sweet or something 

572.10 573.41 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

576.25 584.11 A: yeah i don't know if you watch like the animated stuff now those are pretty funny like you ever saw the show family guy the cartoon 

584.39 585.38 B: no 

585.37 586.21 A: (( mm )) 

586.14 587.52 B: is that a cable show 

587.60 594.98 A: it used to come on channel five but they moved it on they it got cancelled and just the reruns come on i watch that 

593.61 596.01 B: what is that a uh primetime show or 

595.92 596.98 A: (( yeah it ))
