423.61 424.52 A: wow 

424.38 434.11 B: yeah because the the a._c._c. i guess coverage is um you know what they get for the local game a lot then some you have virginia 

431.80 432.64 A: right 

434.05 439.65 B: you know is part of the a._c._c. and everything so typically i guess 

439.99 452.14 B: they'll they'll pick the a._c._c. game up instead of another game but with notre dame and the u._s._c. being two pretty prominent teams as well i was a little bit surprised but not too much i guess i really shouldn't have been 

452.37 453.16 A: right 

452.70 457.36 B: um but it wasn't probably pretty good anyway 'cause my team got crushed [laughter] 

457.40 458.73 A: which team is that 

458.38 459.67 B: uh notre dame 

459.46 460.37 A: okay

464.84 468.48 A: yeah well they they have a bright future definitely now 

465.26 466.14 B: so 

469.17 472.65 A: should be looking forward to their season coming up i think 

471.87 484.69 B: i i hope so we'll see we'll see um i guess florida they have uh they had a really good recruiting class um so they should be on t._v. quite a lot uh
