0.08 1.81 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] hello )) 

0.55 1.64 A: hello 

1.95 2.88 B: hello 

2.64 5.96 A: hi my name is uh ian partridge [noise] 

6.71 9.52 B: [noise] [noise] yes my name is rick carruthers [noise] 

7.19 7.89 A: what 

9.49 10.76 A: pleased to meet you 

10.39 12.12 B: yeah please to meet you too 

12.14 14.71 A: is this the first study that you've participated in 

14.49 15.99 B: [noise] uh yes 

15.91 20.43 A: yeah this is the first time i actually forgot that i'd signed up for this but um [lipsmack] 

19.75 20.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

21.42 23.80 A: i guess i did [laughter] 

22.71 24.89 B: (( [noise] [laughter] well )) 

23.84 24.89 A: so 

25.41 27.60 A: bio terrorism is the topic i guess 

27.24 33.82 B: yeah so and they're saying what can uh the u._s. do to prevent bio terrorism 

33.23 34.04 A: yes 

34.06 42.52 B: well there's not too much they can do to prevent it you know if uh just like just like the the nine eleven 

42.44 43.36 A: mhm 

42.59 47.06 B: situation you know they couldn't prevent that you know so 

47.13 48.27 B: uh 

48.33 50.83 B: if terrorism is here and they uh 

51.08 59.71 B: you know and they had bio bio weapons you know they could you know they could put it in water you know chemicals in water 

59.93 62.72 B: uh in the air you know uh 

62.92 70.47 B: they could go in they could go in like big places just like them tw- the towers the same way and and put it in the air condition unit 

69.60 70.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

70.97 72.33 B: (( you know [noise] hm )) 

71.02 75.20 A: yeah no that is crazy um i guess it depends 

75.27 78.82 A: on what scale they're talking about because 

79.52 83.54 A: it is possible i guess to prevent large 

83.64 86.24 A: extremely large scale use of 

86.43 90.72 A: uh [noise] weapons like launched from another country i guess 

91.20 92.17 A: by 

92.22 93.63 A: [noise] controlling 

93.79 103.85 A: [noise] you know uh m- missiles and the like but they could really do a lot of damage with a really small amount of uh a chemical weapon 

103.60 104.80 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

103.92 109.97 A: but uh yeah i'm with you i'm not cer- quite certain what there is to prevent attacks i guess 

109.09 110.64 B: yeah 

110.83 116.79 B: well i i i i feel like we're okay being too you don't never know who the terrorist is 

111.30 112.13 A: (( you know )) 

116.44 119.15 A: exactly 'cause you can't really screen 

117.24 118.07 B: (( you know )) 

119.00 120.39 B: everybody 

119.41 122.01 A: um everybody 'cause that's not [noise] 

121.95 126.68 B: no and then you got people you got people who sneak into the country 

122.88 124.01 A: (( uh that's true [noise] )) 

126.19 127.94 A: [noise] yeah exactly [noise] 

127.44 129.44 B: you know you got spies 

128.05 128.74 A: you 

129.72 137.87 B: you got everything you know so you know you never know your next door neighbor could be a terrorist yeah and 

134.80 137.57 A: [noise] exactly [noise] um 

137.65 146.76 A: but they do have pretty sophisticated profiling uh schematics but w- in terms of 

146.74 153.45 A: domestic terrorism you know you can't really predict who's gonna hold the grudge against uh the united states 

152.99 154.40 B: [noise] that's right 

153.52 156.85 A: like timothy mcveigh and all those guys in oklahoma city so 

156.19 158.35 B: (( right you hm )) 

157.36 162.24 A: but um yeah as far as manufacturing i'm not quite cer- certain how 

162.93 164.93 A: much they can tell 

165.06 172.31 A: you know who's buying up chemicals and who's doing what you know i don't know what it takes to make anthrax or 

172.72 174.34 A: botulism toxin 

174.94 177.54 A: or serum gas or anything like that so 

177.93 187.73 A: [noise] i don't know how how much you know one thing they could do is restrict those chemicals but in europe or some other countries it's probably very easy to acquire them 

186.70 196.48 B: e- easy access right you know and and like i was saying you got people who sneaks into the country you got you got people with false identification 

189.20 190.09 A: (( and so )) 

196.37 208.76 B: you know and and you got spies just like spies people that come from other country that's spies and stuff and then you got people right here in the united states that's you know that's against the united states you know so 

196.40 197.37 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

208.92 215.23 B: you know yeah yeah i guess if a person uh from another country offered them enough money you know they could be a scientist 

215.03 220.68 B: and if a person offered them enough money you know they could probably make up s- you know some kind of bio chemical 

220.45 231.01 B: you know and what put it er all they all they have to do is maybe like put it in water you know and i know they have water treatment plants and stuff like that there but you know 

227.00 227.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

230.94 237.34 B: we got people that works works within the system you know works in you know that that's 

237.44 239.72 B: against the system you know you 

238.85 239.97 A: exactly 

240.22 244.66 A: so i guess [noise] one way to prevent the attack would be to uh 

246.11 257.04 A: beef up security at those kind of [cough] civic entry points like water supply electricity but that's i mean that's getting into 

257.47 258.50 A: the kind of 

259.45 264.37 A: [mn] you know m- police state that i don't think the u._s. wants to get into 

264.01 266.06 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] right )) 

264.45 268.54 A: where you have cameras and guards everywhere kind of like [noise] [noise] 

266.29 267.83 B: wh- it's it 

267.92 277.27 B: that's just like that's just like they said they was aware of the nine eleven attack but they never done anything about it i guess they didn't take it seriously you know 

276.41 278.90 A: exactly yeah well i mean 

277.58 278.73 B: (( you know something )) 

278.98 280.59 A: there it was [laughter] 

280.60 286.64 A: they tried to blow it up two times before with car bombs and they just hadn't been successful so 

287.31 288.48 A: um 

288.59 290.31 A: it's yeah it is it's 

290.45 293.45 A: basically kind of 

293.72 294.57 A: (( you know )) 

295.28 297.82 A: terr- terrorism is 

298.81 300.42 A: really a uh 

301.51 303.14 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] hm )) 

301.82 307.45 A: difficult thing to prevent because you can't use normal state to [noise] state diplomacy and you can't really 

307.42 319.01 A: [noise] tell tell somebody's government that you're gonna mm you know bomb them with a nuclear bomb if somebody from their country comes in with a terrorist agent 'cause [laughter] uh that that wouldn't quite work 

316.29 317.34 B: (( [noise] [noise] and )) 

318.68 323.75 B: [noise] [lipsmack] and and then too a lot of the time they they know they're willing to sacrifice you know whatever 

323.57 325.60 A: yeah no that's it's true 

325.33 329.35 B: you know look at the guys on the planes you know they sacrificed their own life 

325.95 326.67 A: (( look at )) 

328.71 331.30 A: them [noise] yeah and they didn't even 

329.60 330.37 B: (( you know )) 

332.15 338.20 A: yeah they didn't even get to see [noise] the effects of but you're right [noise] but they're willing to sacrifice 

334.77 336.57 B: right but you know 

337.67 350.42 B: uh i guess they you know maybe maybe you know some kind of arrangements made i feel like this here about a situation like that when you jeopardize your own yeah you you jeopardize and you sacrificing [noise] for a reason so maybe 

349.94 350.83 A: (( exactly [noise] )) 

350.33 361.99 B: maybe you know maybe their family was poor real poor or whatever you know and and money was offered to the family uh maybe to free somebody in the family that you know could've been in prison you know uh [lipsmack] 

362.01 364.10 B: um [lipsmack] some kind of 

364.31 366.14 B: (( a uh he could've been a [lipsmack] )) 

366.41 369.96 B: a political prisoner you know uh 

370.04 372.50 A: yeah no that's definitely true 

370.48 384.75 B: [noise] an- and and i'm willing to sacrifice to better for er to make it better for my rest of my family you know my kids my my mom my sisters my brothers my dad there're you know some willing to sacrifice you know give up everything [noise] for that [noise] you know [noise] 

379.61 381.39 A: mhm 

384.39 386.59 A: (( yeah that's true [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

384.85 386.18 B: (( [lipsmack] you know )) 

386.63 387.69 B: [noise] [noise] so 

387.80 399.51 B: you know [noise] uh [noise] it's it like i said i i don't think there's too much they could do to prevent it [noise] you know because [lipsmack] uh money i think money like i said money's the root of all evil [noise] 

399.53 403.16 B: [lipsmack] and if you know [noise] uh a person a person is 

403.40 409.10 B: [noise] you know you are pre- you are presented with uh uh uh enough figures you know you 

409.14 412.23 B: (( [noise] you know you might try you know and [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

411.01 415.38 A: certainly yeah well that was the problem they had um with a lot of the uh [noise] 

415.59 420.68 A: ex uh [noise] soviet union scientists in [noise] russia they 

421.00 427.28 A: were getting paid by some countries to look the other way and sell some plutonium [laughter] 

426.77 427.99 B: mhm [noise] 

427.47 428.86 A: and uh 

429.08 435.29 A: that's like a just a big problem and and i'm sure it's you know we li- uh like to think that americans are 

434.29 435.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

435.24 440.18 A: proud and noble but i'm sure if somebody got paid enough money 

439.43 441.19 B: [noise] that's right 

440.14 452.57 A: in one of those [sigh] you know uh governments labs so that could trade [noise] secrets or trade toxins and so [noise] i guess yeah there's nothing much [laughter] you can do to prevent [noise] this type of activity 

442.89 444.09 B: [noise] like turning [noise] 

452.99 456.96 B: [noise] [noise] s- s- enough zeros it'd make a person turn their back turn their head [noise] you 

456.94 458.04 A: (( yeah )) 

457.29 459.72 B: know look the other way [noise] you know 

459.59 474.35 B: it's done every day you know [noise] it's done locally you know with the local system [noise] of of of of you know of the law enforcement you know and and i guess it'll go all the way up you know [noise] you know [noise] federal you know 'cause [noise] 

464.21 465.31 A: mhm 

471.22 472.33 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

474.65 483.93 B: [lipsmack] you can uh you know i i personally i know of situations where polices [noise] has been paid off [noise] you know mm they paid [noise] [noise] 

481.14 485.80 A: oh certainly yeah anybody in power can be seduced 

484.09 491.23 B: right uh uh act like they don't know what's going on when you [noise] know like the number rackets [noise] the drug racket [noise] you know 

490.27 491.07 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

491.08 492.08 B: (( [noise] uh )) 

491.88 503.07 B: [noise] the fencing racket you know everything [noise] they'll they'll look the other way when they know something is going on here it's you know at at a certain place [noise] certain locations they know what's happening 

501.11 502.16 A: yeah 

502.95 508.06 B: but [noise] they'll just keep on going pass it by l- you know never stop to 

507.86 508.91 A: exactly 

507.97 516.78 B: you know you see someone looking suspicious or you know they're doing something they ain't got no business and you let it go on [noise] but it and and your job is to serve and protect [noise] 

516.68 523.87 B: you know [noise] and but you you you avoid doing that you know because of [noise] for the love of money you know so 

521.09 522.12 A: (( right )) 

523.31 524.48 A: (( yeah )) 

524.01 534.14 B: [noise] it happens locally like i said within the within the city [noise] then you know it goes on to the state [noise] and then the federal you know people you know money money controls 

533.84 543.89 A: yeah i guess it's kind of like leading me into reach the conclusion that [mn] the only way to fight this terrorism [noise] isn't to to go 

534.25 535.71 B: (( [noise] so [lipsmack] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

544.01 552.69 A: with this kind of big strong armed american approach to kind of prevent anyone from actually getting [noise] it or using it you kind of have to go 

552.75 556.30 A: to look at why they're using it and why [noise] they hate the u._s. 

555.96 557.07 B: yeah right 

556.28 562.99 A: [noise] and try to solve that kind of hatred because it's the way [noise] i feel about the drug problem in the u._s. is 

562.96 572.03 A: if they spent a billion dollars on treatment of poverty and treatment of addiction which is why the people continue to use the drugs 

570.13 573.97 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] instead of locking them up instead of locking them up [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

572.25 575.91 A: instead of locking them up and instead of arresting 

575.86 589.10 A: you know spending billions of dollars sending troops to colombia and [noise] to all around the world to try and stop the drug war and if they actually spent that money [noise] to treat the people who are using the drugs 

588.15 599.89 B: right that's the see and and and that's where i think that they make a big big mistake because they'll lock them up you know like say say you're a user and you get caught with a a a a a ten 

590.02 591.04 A: and so 

593.42 594.25 A: (( yeah )) 

594.45 596.32 A: yeah no that doesn't stop
