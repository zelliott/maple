25.10 26.04 A: (( pardon me )) 

25.71 28.09 B: the the american ale house up there 

27.52 29.91 A: oh what what's his name is it tommy wareham 

28.89 30.67 B: tommy tommy wareham

31.02 31.99 B: yeah he's real 

32.02 34.22 B: he's my relat- he's my h- cousin 

33.93 35.10 A: oh right on 

34.85 38.98 B: hey well the minimum wage what do i think about it what do you think about 

38.36 45.08 A: i i've definitely worked for minimum wage [laughter] before in life and it's a horrible horrible yeah 

44.21 45.70 B: (( it [laughter] sure it is )) 

45.11 47.29 A: it's not enough like 

46.96 48.00 B: yeah 

47.41 49.43 A: to sustain a bird really 

48.61 58.78 B: ah am i for it well i guess i am but i think it floats all the boats so it's just a i think it's just an ethereal kind of political football because you're on the bottom of the scale so 

58.74 69.67 B: what difference does it make if you if you make five fifteen or seven fifteen when everybody else is making two dollars more than you are it's it's relative to what they raise it i i would think i don't think there's really any impact 

59.99 60.97 A: yeah 

69.77 72.48 B: except for people thinking they have more money 

72.13 77.69 A: yeah yeah and everytime they raise they raise minimum wage inflation goes up anyhow 

72.73 73.67 B: you know 

77.28 78.40 B: yeah 

77.77 83.81 A: so it's you are you're not really making any more money you remain at the same poverty level yeah 

83.02 94.81 B: that's right you're on the bottom of the scale and we're in a capitalistic system where everybody's running for the dollar bill and you know um and we can analyze the capital capital system but you have to know w- what the defects are and that meant which 

94.69 100.81 B: so the minute you do that people call you a communist [laughter] but but [laughter] but but 

97.01 99.20 A: uh-huh [laughter] definit- 

100.04 106.92 A: my big ah i i was one i with the business center before so minimum wage is also like ah 

104.02 105.01 B: (( but ah ah were you )) 

107.95 110.20 A: it's good on that end [laughter] 

109.50 118.87 B: right it can be good on that end we we have you're talking from the ah from the greedy other side of the coin of course if you're in a ah we work in a system is it wrong to be an entrepreneur no 

110.85 111.94 A: because 

118.33 119.45 A: yeah 

118.77 130.98 B: is it wrong for someone to have huge success while other people die for their handful ah for the lack of a handful of grain i think so so what what do you the minimum wage yeah you're right and ah and it and we're both right 

130.86 133.94 B: (( whe- whether it's ah ah the way [mn] )) 

134.47 143.17 B: really a subject that we should be talking about well that's what they decided i wonder even why we're talking about these things other than maybe how we talk and how men talk together 

142.64 145.74 A: i think that's it 'cause they want to see how men talk altogether 

143.50 148.47 B: i really think that they don't want to tell they don't they don't want to tell you what the study is really 'cause it skews it you know 

147.80 149.26 A: [laughter] yeah 

148.63 155.03 B: yeah so it doesn't matter to me what the what the real import is and they ask you what kind of phone you use so the telephone company probably funds it 

155.08 161.83 A: [laughter] that is kind of odd i wondered like why they would ask you that because you know it's not really going to change your 

155.10 157.26 B: but the [laughter] but 

157.77 158.70 B: yeah 

159.23 161.47 B: yeah yeah yeah 

161.49 172.67 B: yeah i wonder if the people running this study are getting paid minimum wage [laughter] we're supposed to stay on the subject [laughter] hey give them a raise [laughter] 

165.76 169.57 A: (( [laughter] [cough] actually )) 

170.02 174.19 A: [laughter] you get you get really nice money when you're doing studies 

173.75 176.84 B: (( yes i mean i )) 

175.94 186.91 A: yeah i often do studies here for the university and they give you stipends to do things and i've done part of many focus groups and they pay you like a hundred fifty dollars for three hours 

177.51 179.11 B: (( yeah yeah um )) 

180.59 181.43 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

182.57 184.09 B: yeah i tr- i taught at yeah 

186.18 188.34 B: wow that's ah nice huh 

188.07 189.60 A: yeah it's pretty nice 

188.99 192.29 B: i taught at pen state for a while but no more and my and my 

192.33 199.12 B: my relative taught there mcgary um m. nelson mcgary he had a nervous breakdown um back in the thirties he was a sociologist professor 

198.96 201.30 A: (( oh i would have that was way before me )) 

199.74 200.53 B: he was 

200.66 202.13 B: he was really wacky 

201.83 202.98 A: [laughter] 

202.30 205.12 B: [laughter] so am i though i mean but then 

203.72 206.79 A: ah you i think you have to be a bit to be a professor 

206.35 214.01 B: yeah yeah you have to you have to be published and all that stuff too which isn't ah but the m- ah money what do think about ah 

214.32 219.01 B: [sigh] you know what else can we talk about minimum wage i mean it's a [laughter] 

218.38 223.41 A: well my big thing is is ah it it's like when you're working for minimum wage too 

222.97 224.08 B: mhm 

223.45 235.27 A: it's you you tend to get a poor attitude towards your work because you realise that the people that are paying you or paying if they could pay you less they would is what it says when you're making minimum wage 

227.11 227.96 B: sure 

231.29 233.77 B: (( mm )) 

233.92 236.98 B: mhm ah sure sure you're not an asset you're a liability 

236.34 237.51 A: yeah 

236.87 249.57 B: and that's true if you're a businessman where you look at that person are you going to steal from me [laughter] are you going to are you going to smile at my customers or am i going to i should the trick is to train the people to work for minimum wage and tap dance on the ceiling at the same time 

240.97 242.11 A: yeah it's the 

248.94 250.20 A: mhm 

249.53 263.96 B: those are the rare birds who will do that even though the b- and i think it's important to have that kind of attitude but it's awfully hard when you're making minimum wage because you're saying to yourself oh man [laughter] what am i going to do with this money after [laughter] i get 

262.68 274.49 A: mhm well i found i have a business center it was better to pay your employees so they were comfortable so they wouldn't steal from you because if they start stealing from you it can hurt you more than that extra buck or 

265.86 266.95 B: yeah 

269.65 270.76 B: that's right 

274.14 275.12 B: (( y- yeah )) 

274.50 277.03 A: buck an hour on a on a wage 

275.20 283.84 B: it's the biggest loss in any kind of business i used to run a big ret- retail store and a even managers that ran the whole store used to set up another check out just for them 

283.20 284.45 A: (( yeah )) 

283.89 288.17 B: you know [laughter] we had to ah pay the guy to tell us well how he stole 

288.08 300.86 B: you know i mean well well how did you steal our money [laughter] how did you steal that hundred thousand dollars it wasn't a little bit of money so yeah the the employees are are definitely lia- um can be assets but very often they're liabilities and 

288.12 288.91 A: yeah 

290.80 291.57 A: yeah 

301.20 303.24 B: if they're stealing from you and they're you know 

302.93 309.68 A: yeah especially at entry level at when you're when you're walking into a business with no tro- well no experience 

308.19 310.90 B: what what kind of business did you have 

310.34 312.49 A: i owned a retail clothing store 

312.10 313.01 B: oh did you 

312.73 314.48 A: yes [laughter] 

313.41 318.39 B: okay okay so you know that end you know a a lot of a lot of hours and 

316.25 317.37 A: yes i had 

317.80 324.72 A: i actually had to i had two employees stealing from me for about six months and they cost me a great amount of money 

321.94 322.97 B: mhm 

324.19 327.68 B: ringing people up short or giving them free clothes or what 

326.81 329.11 A: walking away with my merchandise 

328.46 330.57 B: (( oh okay well mm )) 

329.71 335.76 A: and i'm not even sure that like within that that they weren't still selling it to friends you know i think [noise] 

334.32 344.85 B: mm yeah cloth- clothing store's hard to run but i i don't know much about clothing as much as other things but i i i would assume that you you have to buy the right styles the right amount the right sizes and all that stuff and 

344.05 350.67 A: mhm it's hard to keep it like and and especially in clothing the populace is pretty much the same size 

350.13 351.43 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

350.87 363.98 A: you know like that we are all as americans a wide variety of sizes but when you get into specific styles i owned an urban wear clothing store which is kind of like just hip hop and street wear kind of clothing 

358.92 359.84 B: uh-huh oh okay 

363.36 365.73 B: kind of gritty stuff yeah 

364.36 376.42 A: yeah and you'll find that those kids are all about the same size you know i would buy i have i still own clothing from that store that were the ends of the size runs the smallest and the largest 

368.77 369.94 B: mhm 

372.68 373.56 B: mhm 

374.62 375.46 B: (( mm )) 

375.77 377.02 B: mhm 

376.39 379.39 A: you know and i can't ever do anything with it 

378.77 386.56 B: mhm it's the same if you buy tee shirts if you i think i sold tee shirts at one for some kind of ethnic fair and they had these interesting griffins and things where if you 

386.54 400.95 B: and i made a little bit of money but and i found that the ah the small m- and and the um and the mediums and you know you had there were certain people bought extra larges and that was about it where um and some larges you know but um women of course 

388.08 388.88 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

401.09 404.42 B: right y- you could almost predict how many would sell you know 

404.17 405.43 A: yeah yes 

405.01 411.61 B: yeah did you get did you make money in your ah and did you the peop- and did ev- everybody get paid minimum wage 

407.33 409.66 A: yes we did very very well 

411.05 419.71 A: no actually we did we m- we made it a practice at the time minimum wage was i believe five ten and we paid all our employees six and a quarter 

419.32 420.21 B: yeah 

419.62 429.32 A: and they were all students too so like it was a it was a. a cool place to work in state college and b. everybody wanted to work there 'cause you paid more 

421.60 422.54 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

428.40 434.91 B: mm and and if you're if you're paid that and a a a student is kind of different i think because if mommy and daddy are footing the bill 

434.94 443.11 B: you know what i mean they're getting extra money elsewhere and they just want to be able to say hey i have a job [laughter] and i'm you know am i wrong or am i right what 

442.78 453.31 A: mhm no they're you're totally right they're you know like those kids the people that we hired i i mean like i have that was seven years ago and i some of some of my employees are still really good friends 

444.11 445.12 B: yeah 

452.94 453.80 B: mhm 

453.18 458.59 A: because you know like you found the honest ones and you'd find one honest one in every ten 

458.34 459.28 B: right 

458.70 461.63 A: that would come through your door nine of them would try to screw you 

461.22 463.78 B: that rare yeah well hon- honesty is rare 

461.90 462.81 A: yeah 

463.02 471.61 A: oh th- i would go i would go to lunch and you know like i would make my rounds and i'd go by the store while i was on lunch from my other job 

471.52 472.50 B: mhm 

471.55 478.97 A: and just to go by to see how it was going and there'd be like a sign on the door that like be back in ten minutes they where they'd closed my store and leave 

478.44 479.74 B: mhm 

479.10 482.00 A: you know like i'm not paying you not to be there 

481.37 482.62 B: that's right 

482.02 486.67 A: you know and then where are you going what are you doing that's so important you've got to leave work
