75.77 80.74 B: [noise] oh yeah there i didn't catch i didn't [mn] they said it really fast qualities a life partner should have 

80.84 81.93 A: um 

82.89 85.55 A: [lipsmack] uh let's say uh [sigh] 

85.65 99.70 A: spontaneity uh romanticism still um total loyalty um doesn't have to be a monogamous relationship i don't think but it still has to be 

99.68 105.33 A: you know someone that you know that is there for you i mean you know in other words you're number one 

104.24 114.64 B: you see i've never really see i never i've never really been with somebody long enough to write into that situation so and i see b- i kind of see both sides of it so but i haven't experienced it personally so 

109.72 110.56 A: uh-huh 

114.98 117.33 A: okay and um 

118.20 120.19 A: well s- uh 

119.89 123.50 B: see my big one would be c- would be honesty and confidence 

123.16 126.94 A: yes that that's a good one honesty and confidence right [mn] it's a 

125.64 126.71 B: like 

126.86 141.12 B: i don't know i'm just big on people that have confidence i think it's an it's an attractive trait like i'm a confident person i don't like people to be wishy washy i like to have things like it's like it's either there or it's not there if it's not there [mn] just move on so 

141.37 148.12 A: right i would say that too in fact all my life i've been told that that's one of my most attractive qualities that i'm very confident 

148.19 149.30 A: um 

149.79 154.90 A: but uh on the other hand people that aren't as confident i find myself always uh 

155.24 161.36 A: saving people that aren't as confident or seeing that it not as a negative thing but sort of as a 

161.45 169.32 A: [mn] [mn] nai- [mn] sort of a naive thing or a um innocence you know maybe sometimes when people aren't as c- confident 

169.40 178.52 A: although confidence can lead to distrust you know and makes me wonder about their wishy washness and and all that kind of stuff and if they're really honest you know 

178.42 180.47 B: yeah i'm not very good at helping people 

180.57 181.71 A: oh really h- 

181.03 184.23 B: but [laughter] sounds really shallow but 

184.71 186.06 A: how old are you 

184.77 196.62 B: i'm an aqu- i'm an aquarius so my trait doesn't have it but my however though i'm like if i was like by myself personally for a life partner like i think that i [mn] at least provide somebody that's sort of like steady 

197.07 198.01 A: right 

197.40 207.64 B: i'm not sure if st- [mn] stabil- i guess stability i guess that would be a that would be a trait but i like somebody else to have to have like live in the same town for like ten years to be stable 

207.59 211.26 A: no no i no i don't think stability right exactly you can be 

211.47 220.18 A: and stable that i don't i don't like people that are boring i don't like to be the one who's always entertaining i i'd someone that actually to be a little v- [mn] you know 

220.21 223.49 A: make decisions and entertain me for a change you know 

223.21 229.08 B: [noise] [noise] oh yeah that's a good that's a good point see my a life partner for me would have to love to travel 'cause i travel all the time so 

229.09 230.15 A: (( what do you do )) 

230.57 244.23 B: i i travel for work but i travel for fun that's how i spend my money like i don't i'm not the kind of person who's gonna go out to bars that often or go to clubs or really g- i mean i drink sometime you know i drink sometimes but like i wouldn't need that person that could travel that would have 

244.47 249.85 B: money i mean like could just sort of get up and go somewhere for the weekend like that wouldn't please me in the least so 

250.05 258.67 A: right [lipsmack] i have the lover that i did have because um we used to live in new york city that's where i'm from and um 

256.58 257.54 B: that's fun 

258.68 266.86 A: he complained he moved from california to l- live with me and his main complaint was you know how could he ever have a job 

266.79 281.72 A: when having me for a lover because any minute you know we're flying off to here or doing this or doing that and so you know and i would give him a hard time about it so i ended up paying for everything and just you know [sigh] that kind of lost made me lose maybe a little bit of my 

281.31 285.10 B: i need a boyfriend who'll support my frequent flyer miles [laughter] 

284.23 286.36 A: [laughter] 

285.24 287.20 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

286.95 289.21 A: um but 

287.91 302.59 B: but yeah like if you it's actually kind of funny 'cause like well [mn] which i can it's kind of fu- my codependent i call him my codependent best friend m- my but it worked my my boss who's gay calls calls him my my uh domestic partner even though he wasn't i would i live in delaware 

302.37 314.62 B: that but i've created somebody who likes to fly so he has now he has i've cr- added a trait in a close friend that h- would be something that i would want in a partner which would be like liking to fly and airplanes like that 

312.97 317.35 A: [mn] right that would be a good that's a very good point yeah 

315.57 321.05 B: [mn] well you're trying to progress i think with people that you're interested in that you like that you're close to 

321.31 323.84 B: so y- you want them to have your interests 

321.43 322.73 A: well i i i 

323.86 331.38 A: right you do want 'em to have your interests but also they do have to have a separate light i've realized a long time ago all the people when you could become too codependent 

331.52 345.99 A: and someone doesn't have their own identity in fact that's why we broke up he said he always felt like you know he was mrs [mn] you know whatever and er er people identified with him as that you know oh you're ron's lover you know until him being just you 

345.72 348.85 B: oh that's oh it's a that's a good one yeah 

346.08 347.01 A: (( know he- )) 

348.90 350.29 A: so um 

350.74 353.12 A: it's hard you know because people that 

352.02 357.54 B: so you want a personality that where somebody is equal instead of one person that's more dominant than the other person [mn] 

356.95 359.90 A: yeah i do i think at this point um 

360.11 365.31 A: i'm a little more dominant always but i i would like for someone to be able to be you know who 

365.32 367.24 A: i guess it's hard with two males 

367.76 371.56 A: you know i've been on both si- i've been married also to women and um 

370.73 372.52 B: oh really interesting [noise] 

372.62 375.33 A: so they they seem to um 

375.26 380.13 A: women always will become submissive even when they're strong but i'm only attracted to strong women 

379.99 391.64 A: but they will be submissive with me even there are times they will dominate me it's very funny i actually i should say that p- people i think can be have different traits to the personality even if i am dominant most of the time 

391.42 403.19 A: i can be submissive i mean there's parts of me like my wife used to say uh you know being married to you is like being married to jayne mansfield and denis the menace i mean uh you know [laughter] i was like 

402.12 409.62 B: so you're but i that's an ins- i guess dominant i guess if someone happ- their d- dominance of their personality is certainly a trait they would they would have 

409.64 411.14 A: yep yep 

410.85 423.70 B: i just get tired of it 'cause i get i always seem to end up dating the people and like one of them's my best friend that has been for like three years but i dated him and he would have that sort of not necessarily submissive personality but one of those sort of helpful you know that needs to be helped 

411.15 412.07 A: still 

423.77 427.94 B: child like kind of personality so i tend to run into those kind of people 

423.98 424.82 A: (( like a )) 

425.89 427.01 A: right 

428.53 438.10 A: and i have that trait myself but i help a lot of people that need that i feel that uh i'm trying to protect them or something i don't know although their 

437.34 446.27 B: see i don't have the patience to protect people i think that people like i come from a family where you have to do things on your own and like my parents did things on their own and 

446.44 447.93 A: (( [mn] well )) 

446.45 449.72 B: i like come to other people for help so 

449.08 453.51 A: right so you live in d- near delaware do you get over to hovers beach and all that 

452.88 454.66 B: (( i don't no [sigh] )) 

454.59 457.86 A: oh is anybody gone delaware or you go to philly 

454.85 455.78 B: (( nope )) 

457.92 460.52 B: i i go to philly anyway in washington d._c. 

460.26 461.11 A: (( uh-huh )) 

461.01 475.03 B: [laughter] and whereabouts and i'm going to boston tomorrow i always and it's always funny 'cause like i went on a date speaking of life partners i i went on a date last time i was in boston i hung out with this guy and it was he was j- other than a little bit of drug use which i have no interest in that [mn] 

462.17 463.08 A: (( yeah i )) 

474.96 480.51 B: like he was a you know con- you know he was confident he was smart he worked as a web developer 

480.32 490.27 B: you know he was attractive you know he worked out and it's like and so it's very easy to when you travel to find people that you think could be your you know your boyfriend or your partner or whatever 

489.47 500.74 A: was it in front of like but the p- problem with that is is that's and illusion i used to travel a lot too you know what it is it's because [laughter] remember you're you're basically on holiday and and in absolute terms you know 

494.31 495.48 B: (( [laughter] oh i )) 

498.68 499.84 B: know oh i know 

500.02 501.79 B: i'm on holiday all the 

501.52 502.85 A: (( right [mn] [mn] )) 

502.17 508.78 B: i have seven weeks i get like seven weeks of vacation i'm on holiday all the time so but you know the book said that that makes it difficult for me to find someone 

508.58 522.72 B: necessarily to you know to date or to i don't like i don't really like the word lover for some reason but like you know the to find for a partner or something like that 'cause i always feel like i'm not home enough to do that but i'm wondering if i i was wondering if i travel to avoid it so 

522.87 524.88 A: you could be i used 

523.80 526.74 B: i could be so i've been traveling i've been traveling a lot so 

527.18 528.85 A: (( to um how old are you )) 

527.89 528.81 B: (( that's my )) 

529.03 530.13 B: twenty six 

530.47 533.14 A: definitely you're doing that [laughter] 

531.81 534.29 B: [laughter] 

533.95 535.09 A: [laughter] 

534.13 544.88 B: that is actually kind of funny i but i have a tendency to find friends that like fulfil different niches that that i don't necessarily i was i think it's my way of trying to find people that will fill those niches so i don't have to have a partner like um 

544.72 554.15 B: you know hook up with some people have my best friend for uh some things like i made a a friend that i travel with now you know who has a good job and stuff like that so 

553.92 555.44 A: but do you have sex 

556.05 559.37 B: with that friend no uh-huh i don't have sex with my best friend either so 

557.36 557.92 A: (( [mn] )) 

558.73 564.36 A: i don't have some friends i m right and i it kills me when people have sex with their friends to me that's just bizarre i mean 

565.07 579.22 A: i've had friends i've had a re- you know what's really bad is when you have friends that you don't realize it that when i was younger that were in love with me and i didn't realize until somebody else told me that you know they thought of me as a lover even though we never had sex or nothing 

579.05 580.41 A: i was wondering why they 

580.44 588.08 A: would act jealous when you know or act strange around people i was dating and here you know i never was aware that they were actually in love with me but 

587.77 595.80 B: [mn] yeah i think my best friend i think that my isaac m- i um my best friend and i hold each other back i think from dating other people i think we're perfectly good at s- you know 

595.86 599.89 B: sleeping with other people but i think that we hold each other back from dating other people
