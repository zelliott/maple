116.38 117.28 B: sure 

119.32 120.47 B: no problem 

119.52 125.94 A: [noise] so what was the was the topic just exercise and how it benefits and 

124.10 134.97 B: yeah i did w- i did this one before i think they just like talk to somebody and they like monitor like your like your vocal tones and stuff like that 

133.69 134.26 A: (( v- )) 

134.34 135.73 A: vocal tones 

135.33 138.93 B: i don't know like people's interaction with each other 

138.72 139.81 A: ah 

139.13 144.37 B: and then they just give you a topic so you're you're just two people just don't sit on the phone and don't do anything 

143.38 146.86 A: so so it really doesn't have much to do with the actual topic 

146.43 152.45 B: n- that's what the woman told me that i sp- i did it once before and that's what the woman told me 

151.50 152.44 A: okay 

152.99 153.89 B: so 

153.57 154.51 A: (( i see )) 

155.05 155.98 B: yeah 

155.06 155.98 A: so 

156.89 167.55 A: yeah i've noticed actually i've been trying to gain weight and actually gain muscle and um i took some weight gainer for [noise] for a month [noise] and i'm 

161.83 162.72 B: yeah 

166.42 167.51 B: did it work 

167.62 181.46 A: pretty lean naturally but i wanted to actually bulk up so i took this like really high calorie weight gainer for a whole month twice a day and only gained a pound and a half while working out four times a week 

174.14 175.15 B: mhm 

181.61 190.33 A: so in that case exercise completely frustrated me because i was aiming for something [noise] and it just didn't come 

188.59 189.53 B: yeah 

190.77 191.93 A: but 

191.33 196.95 B: i've taken that stuff before it just it i don't think it works i think it's more about genetics [laughter] 

196.99 199.01 B: unless you're like a huge guy 

199.53 200.36 A: yeah 

199.57 206.35 B: it's pr- it's pretty tough i've taken that stuff and i'm like very skinny also and i work on it it just doesn't make a difference 

206.44 209.18 A: yeah you can get stronger for sure but 

208.60 213.53 B: yeah i mean it's your metabolism that is what it comes down to 

213.66 214.60 A: yeah 

214.00 214.98 B: so 

215.83 217.66 A: yeah i [noise] 

218.35 220.38 A: i regardless of 

220.74 222.43 A: physical appearance 

222.44 225.10 A: i think everyone in this world should be 

225.33 226.37 A: active 

226.27 227.43 B: oh of course 

226.54 227.44 A: really 

227.56 232.90 A: and i think it's really sad when if you [noise] propose something active and someone's 

232.93 241.26 A: just like oh you mean that means getting up or doing something and i'm like oh come on it's gonna be fun and it it's [noise] healthy you know 

240.46 242.72 B: mhm sure 

243.75 246.05 A: [noise] yeah i think [noise] along with 

246.13 259.35 A: exercise comes i guess it's proven that exercising really does [noise] increase certain chemicals like dopamine and serotonin and [noise] a lot of people are taking drugs like prescribed drugs just for these chemicals when 

259.62 265.25 A: uh i think just taking care of theirselves and keeping active would actually 

265.83 270.24 A: [cough] provide what what psychiatrists are prescribing 

269.96 271.55 B: mhm 

271.68 273.13 A: yeah i think 

272.59 274.70 B: are you a s- do you go to school or 

274.67 276.06 A: yeah i go to 

276.45 277.75 A: upstate new york 

277.33 279.14 B: yeah 

278.87 280.18 A: yep 

280.93 285.16 B: [noise] do they have like uh like a a gym and stuff on campus or 

284.56 287.48 A: yeah a pretty decent facility it's uh 

286.37 287.31 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

287.92 290.98 A: they have all sorts not a lot of like um 

291.16 302.38 A: [lipsmack] i don't know what you call it a lot of m- all the free weights i could ever want and some uh what do you you call the machines that are already pre set you just put a pen in them i don't really know what they're called 

301.31 304.16 B: oh like nautilus or 

303.69 309.82 A: yeah yeah they have some of that which i think is much better for your body just for free weights just because 

304.26 306.06 B: something like that 

309.92 315.11 A: use so much more rang of motion it's not preset by some engineer you know 

314.75 319.62 B: yeah well those are those are better for like girls and stuff that can't lift 

315.59 317.50 A: but it is good good for 

319.38 320.40 A: (( [noise] they're what )) 

320.07 328.07 B: those are those are better for like like girls and women who can't lift like you know heavy free weights and stuff but they could still do like a bench or [noise] 

324.33 325.23 A: yeah 

326.17 328.54 A: yeah and i guess some toning i guess 

328.89 334.75 A: can be good for toning certain muscles but i'd say some is good like the peck deck 

334.89 335.85 A: you know 

334.91 335.85 B: sure 

335.98 338.15 A: that's pretty helpful 

338.68 340.10 A: (( [noise] yeah it's )) 

340.49 346.01 A: yeah the the facilities are pretty nice now i have a membership to uh like a summer membership to a gym and 

345.48 346.46 B: mhm 

346.63 348.20 A: and uh [cough] 

348.33 349.80 A: it's a pretty nice place 

350.13 351.20 A: um 

351.68 364.41 A: yeah most everything i could ever want except [mn] yeah some of the machines just seem cheesy it seems just like a waste to build a machine like that when you can just do the same exercise and even have more benefits just from 

365.01 368.05 A: you know holding using free weights using [noise] 

366.56 368.16 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

368.08 369.87 A: yeah 

370.12 379.43 A: [noise] yeah it's something hopefully you know will be uh something i do until i'm older but i've already noticed from lifting heavy weights 

379.87 385.15 A: that my joints are definitely paying a price like i used to play baseball and i i 

385.21 386.34 A: (( i was a pitcher )) 

386.41 387.81 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

386.56 388.62 A: and i'd been 

388.52 402.23 A: working my shoulders out a lot recently because i think they're really under developed and i went to throw a tennis ball the other day and my shoulder completely didn't throw it out it just hurts like really bad and i think it's probably from just straining my shoulder 

399.37 401.22 B: mhm 

402.67 403.65 A: so 

402.69 403.64 B: yeah 

403.79 409.07 A: there's also a flipside i guess [noise] if you take it too far it can really really hurt your joints 

409.09 411.53 B: yeah i agree definitely 

411.43 417.09 A: yeah and i see s- [noise] i think good form good form i didn't really understand it until uh 

417.26 421.08 A: i saw what other people were doing like curls 

421.17 435.47 A: like winging the bar up with their back [noise] and not only looks ridiculous that doesn't really matter but it's i guess really really bad for your back it and all all parts of your body if you're not really controlled 

435.91 438.69 A: or like you know know what you're doing 

438.14 439.56 B: mhm 

438.94 448.21 A: so i don't know do you think heavy lifting heavy weights is really even are people humans are even meant to do that 

447.83 452.09 B: [noise] [laughter] that's a great question you see these people at the gym i mean 

452.70 456.15 B: it sometimes seems unnatural when this guy has like you know 

456.23 458.23 B: three hundred pounds he's benching 

458.76 459.90 A: yeah 

458.89 466.94 B: but but i mean clearly if he's able to do it then i guess humans are meant to do it but is it necessary i mean that's a whole nother issue 

467.40 468.85 A: (( yeah i don't )) 

469.07 470.25 A: i don't know 

470.42 473.57 A: i mean the guy on jackass was was able to 

473.64 475.13 A: stuff w- uh 

475.16 476.99 A: sniff wasabi up his nose 

476.92 478.20 B: yeah 

477.65 483.88 A: but [laughter] you know it was probably damaging to something some part of his body 

483.68 484.75 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

483.97 497.39 A: so i don't i i know what you mean if you know if you can do it maybe maybe it's all right but at what point going back to early man or earlier time well actually 

497.41 500.79 A: the pyramids the pyramids that built by humans 

501.10 503.35 A: and how large and heavy were 

503.59 504.82 A: you know all of those 

505.08 507.01 A: (( o- or the materials used )) 

507.09 514.78 A: so maybe at one point it really w- and was actually like essential for people to be able to lift really heavy things 

511.44 512.58 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

514.58 515.61 B: mhm 

514.94 526.40 A: now we have cranes of course and all sorts of machines but uh [sigh] i'd say a lot of manual labor even now requires people to be really strong 

525.73 527.81 B: yeah of course i mean 

528.36 535.31 B: that and athletes need to be strong but i mean there's i i mean i don't know at certain point i think it's ridiculous 

535.49 536.53 A: yeah 

535.61 539.74 B: don't they don't need to be so big you can't fit into like any clothes [laughter] 

540.76 545.33 B: that's and just when you get that big you're like it almost becomes cumbersome you know 

545.79 548.45 A: (( yeah [noise] yeah i don't )) 

548.54 553.08 A: kind of hard to draw the line or [noise] where do you draw the line i don't 

552.51 553.61 B: no i know 

554.28 555.66 A: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

556.48 559.65 A: but i think yeah there's no question whether 

560.09 562.02 A: moving around or lifting weights is 

562.62 564.95 A: beneficial to anyone if they can do it 

563.87 564.78 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

566.49 567.53 B: sure 

567.64 569.48 A: yeah 

569.72 573.25 B: yeah we got like a couple more seconds in [laughter] 

569.80 570.64 A: (( uh )) 

572.53 573.78 A: [laughter] 

573.80 574.40 A: (( [noise] )) 

574.13 580.67 B: it's just like the one time i did it it just like stopped it's like you'll have thirty seconds to say goodbye like cuts you off 

580.89 582.78 A: (( [noise] ah [noise] )) 

582.36 585.73 B: (( but then i don't know what happens they mail you money i don't know how it works )) 

582.86 583.53 A: (( so )) 

586.11 589.48 A: ah i guess they i guess something like that 

588.21 590.50 B: did you call in or your phone rang 

590.66 592.21 A: my phone rang 

591.65 592.94 B: oh really 

592.88 593.91 A: yours too 

593.74 597.05 B: no i called the they sent an email with like an eight hundred number 

598.05 599.42 B: that's interesting 

598.34 599.88 A: oh so you can do it any time you
