12.58 14.10 B: nice to meet you paul 

14.41 16.68 B: so did you catch the topic 

16.59 28.46 A: uh yeah it sounded like they posed it as a as a couple of yes or no questions are you exercising if not do you want to uh no and yes [laughter] must do more [laughter] 

21.37 22.18 B: (( yeah mm )) 

24.52 26.34 B: yeah [laughter] 

27.38 33.07 B: well i regularly exercise and s- i like it i go 

33.31 37.42 B: monday wednesdays fridays [laughter] three times a week i try 

36.11 36.85 A: (( do you )) 

37.28 38.66 A: you're going to a club 

38.99 43.96 B: yeah a couple actually [laughter] but i go to one and i play 

43.27 44.52 A: i 

44.62 52.47 A: i used to belong to a couple too i'm from northern california i used to belong to a club called the telegraph hill club in san francisco are you familiar with it 

51.16 55.44 B: what's that no i'm uh in davis sacramento 

54.73 57.48 A: oh you're way oh you're further further north then 

57.52 58.35 B: yeah 

57.55 59.93 A: [lipsmack] uh north and east [lipsmack] uh 

58.96 59.84 B: yeah 

60.05 68.92 A: uh i found myself at that time uh like many many people i think who belong to clubs they ha- are well intentioned and and usually then over time 

68.84 77.65 A: uh begin to fade a little bit and uh at some point in time realize you're paying for something you're not using and and make the decision to to stop i'm sure there's been 

70.73 72.04 B: yeah 

74.66 75.92 B: yeah 

77.69 81.17 A: many many [mn] examples of that 

80.30 91.25 B: yeah i know exactly what you mean it just gets hard you get caught up in your work and you just gotta keep that regularly scheduled thing and it has to become embedded in you 

91.43 97.69 B: you have to lots of times just force yourself just push yourself to keep that schedule 

97.57 106.17 A: it takes a lot of discipline to sustain it i have something i have not tried and i guess this is part of the way the question was posed to us uh 

99.37 100.34 B: yeah 

106.04 113.56 A: um would i like to i i i think i probably would although i don't know if i would will rather and that is uh the idea of a personal trainer 

113.45 117.71 A: at least in southern california that's a very popular uh concept where 

116.20 117.14 B: yeah 

117.60 132.25 A: you hire somebody or they've got their own little s- personal gym of some sort and you're i i don't know exactly how it works but obviously they customize some kind of a routine for you and stand there and look at you to make you keep doing it on a regular basis whatever it is you've decided you're going to be doing 

131.61 143.03 B: yeah yeah i know a couple of friends that are personal trainers and they do that they ha- yeah they're with twenty four hour fitness 

138.49 139.71 A: really 

143.16 149.06 A: is that a uh is that a good business i i guess i didn't uh realize it was maybe as prevalent as it perhaps is 

149.32 153.01 B: oh twenty four hour or the being a trainer 

153.02 154.85 A: the trainer part i i mean 

154.35 168.38 B: oh yeah um well they told me you know it's it's kinda cycli- cyclical like when there are there was the bubble in ninety nine they lots of people were hiring personal trainers and it's it's kind of uh 

168.74 173.72 B: extra thing it's not a necessity for people so they do it more for 

174.01 177.85 B: i guess show and you know when they have extra money 

178.55 179.15 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

178.65 186.36 A: i know that when i was using the club i mentioned uh they also had s- personnel who sort of act that way but they were more uh 

186.31 197.46 A: to get you started and make sure you knew how to use the equipment at the time i was using nautilus um so you don't hurt yourself and you progress over time to increase weights and tensions and whatnot but they really were not uh 

197.63 206.10 A: a- attempting to tailor a program for you personally and be with you every time you're you're going through it which is what i i believe these personal trainers are intended to do 

203.63 204.62 B: yeah 

206.48 212.66 B: yeah and lots of times they have computers that do programs for you these days so 

212.12 213.14 A: that so 

213.00 214.39 B: yeah um 

213.70 215.18 A: how does that work 

215.02 223.76 B: well on the internet uh i know there are some i remember just here in school we had some and [noise] uh 

223.74 230.50 B: just the weightlifting classes and it just we had programs and we gradually increased 

230.60 236.92 B: [noise] i i didn't you know they were all right the programs but it really depends on the person and sometimes it 

236.93 241.50 B: you have to really stick to a program for it to work [noise] [noise] 

241.35 247.97 A: yeah i could see the value in like uh lots of things with computers to help you uh keep track and be organized but it uh 

248.03 256.00 A: it doesn't strike me as something that would automatically give you the discipline like a real personal person trainer that you're expected to show up at a certain time and you know is uh 

250.96 252.14 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

256.05 263.33 A: uh you're also paying for but you're you know is expecting to work with you and you you sort of have to b- have to sort of do it i think [laughter] 

263.09 264.90 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

263.39 270.46 A: uh i can't imagine a computer causing that kind of a discipline although certainly the organization part of it could be very helpful 

266.50 267.46 B: [laughter] 

269.88 273.01 B: a- maybe shock therapy [laughter] [laughter] 

272.13 281.47 A: [laughter] and you'd have to have an awful big computer alarm that uh became a real pain in the in the in the behind in order to [laughter] so you couldn't ignore it i suppose but uh 

281.57 284.93 A: short of that uh i i don't know it just sounds like a 

285.05 290.00 A: sort of an interesting su- sup- supplement rather than necessarily the the primary uh 

290.07 291.14 A: motivator 

290.72 292.98 B: [noise] that's probably that see- 

291.47 299.53 A: uh so you've been doing this have you found yourself able to to exercise on a on a sustained regular basis you sound like you're a younger fellow so maybe you haven't uh 

299.39 300.57 B: yeah well 

299.76 302.80 A: a- as you get older you find you go through cycles of these things 

302.21 304.43 B: yeah yeah um 

304.63 315.45 B: well i've been doing it for oh about two years now and but off yeah like um like just i'm going u._c. berkeley i just finished my first semester 

315.50 316.23 A: oh 

315.62 324.42 B: or my first year [mn] in my second semester though uh yeah i didn't go as much as regularly as i would have liked [noise] to so 

324.49 328.96 B: i know when school starts i really [noise] need to 

329.28 333.05 B: [noise] focus more on my school [noise] then uh 

333.44 338.69 B: it becomes secondary [noise] so regular exercise and i think [noise] 

337.30 351.68 A: well it's easy to have it in a have it to have other things become uh more priority uh driven i found uh when i was exercising more seriously a few years ago that having goals made a big difference i i got into running on the beach i lived at the beach 

351.02 352.54 B: (( [noise] [noise] okay [noise] [noise] )) 

351.58 356.84 A: and uh worked myself up to do a ten k. race that was coming up several months in the future 

356.69 366.88 A: and i know that kept me on on a pretty rigid path just to several times a week really put some serious time in because i knew where i was trying to end up and the goal aspect of it made a big difference 

366.88 378.40 A: uh but there's definitely a drop off after that unless you uh really get into that cycle on an ongoing basis but goals are certainly a a help in that discipline um side of things i believe 

378.27 392.57 B: yeah i agree 'cause it y- you really have to i- it gets kinda redundant every time you do it it's like why am i doing this but if you have that goal and you're doing it for a purpose you have more motivation [noise] 

393.36 405.27 A: you think many people particularly maybe your age uh are motivated by just going to gyms where there's uh lots of other people and social uh implications or social interactions that are sort of part of the scene think that's a 

403.65 406.78 B: yeah i definitely definitely i think so 

406.67 420.40 B: it just ha- you know lo- uh e- everybody's at the gym it's a good place to just meet and you know get exercise and you meet other people you'd never meet this whole slew of people there 

420.21 426.80 A: well i know that was part of what kept me uh interested in the club i mentioned earlier when i when i happened to live up in san francisco was uh 

426.72 438.17 A: it was definitely a a social aspect to it and the fact that you had to be out there in front of a bunch of other people made a li- little more self conscious to be serious about it and uh not particularly stand out as uh 

438.12 444.60 A: out of shape and out of out of mind or whatever uh a little bit of pressure i guess from that standpoint that definitely did make a difference 

444.63 457.02 A: um but i do think there's a cyclical um issue to exercise in general as as years go by and distractions come and go and as you point out there's a certain tediousness to repeating things over and over and over 

452.19 453.48 B: (( mhm [laughter] yeah )) 

457.17 463.41 A: uh after uh you know a sustained period of time un- unless there's some significant goals that that keep driving you 

463.66 474.64 A: uh typically sporting events or some kind of uh you know racing or or whatever that uh might be the case but to just keep doing it and doing it and doing it uh i commend the people that are able to 

474.53 485.69 B: yeah yeah mhm yeah and [noise] especially like sports players that do it for their careers their lives and i mean they obviously have a motivation of money but other people just that do it for 

485.67 491.12 B: fun that's a hobby yeah it's very commendable thing 

491.22 497.97 A: it it really is you're you're still a still a young guy it'd be interesting to see what your perspectives are a few years down the road but i think it uh 

496.72 497.71 B: yeah 

498.00 500.47 A: that you'll find that the [laughter] at least uh 

500.32 513.59 A: most people i think find that it's a really difficult thing uh to uh to continue to keep doing i i don't know statistics but i would have to believe that there's a giant uptick beginning of every year that then uh slides down 

513.57 519.34 A: in the february march pretty rapidly when people start off with good intentions and and fade 

516.01 517.42 B: oh yeah easy to 

518.34 519.22 B: yeah 

519.43 526.57 B: even weekly like i well mondays are always the busiest days and fridays are the quietest days 

525.82 528.04 A: [noise] [laughter] 

526.78 532.80 B: they're it's just people start off the week oh i'm going to do it the whole week and then they just crash 

534.21 541.33 A: that's uh i i guess i don't recall that exactly but i certainly do uh see why that would be very very likely the case it's uh 

541.50 549.38 A: the the the competition for time and the tediousness sort of build up at the same point to uh say i'd rather be doing different things after uh 

549.68 554.78 A: after the the drudgery of just a normal week no matter what it is whether it's school or work or or what have you 

554.98 561.92 A: that uh good intention on monday morning fade probably or or distractions become more significant probably too 

561.72 563.96 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

563.28 575.59 A: though i guess i i i don't know what to say except that uh certainly it's a commendable worthwhile thing that uh we should all do although i i don't know we haven't talked about diet and other things that i think have some pretty equal importance 

569.57 570.33 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

575.31 576.36 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

575.55 579.87 A: but uh certainly from what i can un- what my observations have been that uh 

579.94 587.25 A: that uh contributes a great deal either up or down to your your overall physical health and certainly exercise is always important but 

587.30 599.89 A: very poor uh diet can sort of put a big hole in whatever results you're otherwise able to achieve so i've s- sort of got that balance uh and now that's a discipline that you can work on i think probably might
