66.53 67.49 A: uh-huh 

67.64 71.26 A: how important do you feel it is uh that people work out 

71.77 79.07 B: eh you know it depends on the person you know if you're active i don't think you you need to but if you sit at a desk all day 

72.02 73.19 A: in other words 

79.22 81.33 B: then you know you're gonna [noise] 

81.35 83.21 A: and do you sit at a desk all day 

81.76 82.56 B: figure

85.11 87.72 A: (( um what what is your occupation if i might ask )) 

87.18 100.97 B: i'm uh i'm a trainer for an insurance company so i travel a lot and am all over all over the place but i just i can't sit still that long so i've never never had a weight problem and never 

90.62 91.91 A: uh i see 

100.90 103.16 B: never felt the need to work out so 

103.60 110.35 B: yeah [noise] it's kind of a ironic topic i eat fast food non stop and never work out so [noise] 

110.39 118.48 A: well i mean if you're not gaining weight and you you're you're uh still in your youth and your uh uh metabolism is high uh 

110.48 111.79 B: well what about 

118.50 119.68 A: then th- 

119.87 120.72 B: (( [noise] )) 

120.14 127.52 A: that's uh probably not the number one thing on your mind uh but there are a lot of people in america who uh 

127.82 134.47 A: have like you say the desk job and uh they're depressed uh over it uh or their work and uh 

129.14 130.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

131.60 132.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

134.54 147.22 A: and this tends to slow down their metabolism and they've got to do something about it because uh and my understanding is that two out of three americans are overweight and one out of [noise] three are grossly overweight 

144.68 145.71 B: yeah 

147.71 150.26 B: (( well what do you do to work out usually i ))

165.78 173.38 A: anyway what do i do to work well i live um right here at gifford park which is uh the l- largest uh city park in america 

173.45 188.21 A: and i have a bicycle and it also borders the l._a. river and they've just made a beautiful river bikeway that goes all the way down to long beach and you can ride your bike along this uh l._a. river um 

184.65 185.56 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

188.24 192.04 A: bikeway all the way down to long beach and uh 

192.33 200.16 A: that's one of the ways i work out uh this apartment complex which is uh owned by the oakwood uh corporation uh 

200.25 204.00 A: they own about ten million of these apartments uh world- [laughter] -wide i think 

204.12 205.20 A: (( um )) 

205.61 209.78 A: they provide gyms and they provide uh also uh 

209.85 211.39 A: jacuzzis 

211.46 222.61 A: uh which are you know eh when you know how you feel after you work out your muscles are a little sore so i get in that jacuzzi there and that kind of soothes them out a little bit all those ripples [noise] 

216.22 217.14 B: yeah 

222.37 229.59 B: yeah that sounds like you do a lot like me though then is you don't really say well i'm gonna go work out you go and do something 

222.75 223.87 A: uh 

227.86 238.78 A: no i don't like that either i i i really do not like the regimentation every time i joined a gym just like yourself i found i didn't get my money's worth because i would go 

238.67 248.87 A: first twice a week or then once a week then once every other week and it finally went down to once a month i'd be getting there you know and i didn't like waiting in line for the equipment 

248.56 249.74 B: yeah 

249.14 261.22 A: uh that's the main thing uh in gyms you every er it seems like the piece you want and then there's somebody always hurrying you waiting over you or somebody sweating over you which is [laughter] even worse in my [laughter] opinion 

260.72 262.01 B: yeah yeah 

261.43 262.37 A: [laughter] 

262.23 273.21 B: well this is it i i can't go and say hey i'm gonna work out but you know i'll go to the lake and spend a whole day out jet skiing and anybody that goes with me comes home and five days later is still complaining that they're sore 

262.43 263.27 A: (( so )) 

273.43 277.36 B: from the work out that they got uh i go to lake pleasant usually 

273.46 275.32 A: now what lake is this 

277.34 279.09 A: okay now is 

278.30 279.11 B: but 

279.11 280.96 A: now j- is jet skiing 

279.22 281.18 B: they'll be for five days later 

281.01 284.53 A: is jet skiing really uh uh taxing to the uh 

284.83 288.50 A: uh the muscles and your your system 

287.88 292.49 B: well when you do a stand up one it uh you know it's a lot like water skiing 

292.60 298.91 B: and like i said my my friends that go with me will be sore five days later you know from the load they put on the muscles and they'll say it's 

298.97 301.61 B: and these are people that go to the gym you know such as 

300.69 302.24 A: do you swim at all 

302.52 305.31 B: uh uh you know a bit not as much out at the lake 

304.62 309.14 A: well i- isn't it necessary to be a good swimmer if you're a jet skier and 

307.81 309.66 B: (( but not really )) 

310.27 312.68 A: you wear your life jacket and uh 

312.61 314.58 B: yeah you have to by law have it 

314.15 323.66 A: by law and and so you felt that if you did uh lose your your crap that you would be able to hang on until somebody came there when you got a life jacket on 

325.13 327.53 A: uh eh c- how far can you swim 

327.81 328.44 B: (( [noise] [noise] ))

412.77 414.01 B: no so 

413.40 416.54 A: no i i smoke a cigar once in a while but uh 

417.03 422.63 A: you know when we got the truth out there you have to be a little bit crazy to smoke so that certainly would harm your health 

421.14 422.28 B: [laughter] 

422.88 424.02 B: (( [mn] [noise] yeah )) 

422.92 426.77 A: uh do you think they ought to ban cigarettes for health's sake in america 

426.50 433.53 B: well i mean people will still get them but no uh definitely i i think they're on the right track just taxing the living heck out of them 

433.54 434.52 B: and uh 

434.62 437.10 B: use that money to pay for the health care 'cause 

437.36 441.93 B: but if you if you totally ban it then it's just going to become black market and we get no money from it 

442.00 442.92 A: uh-huh 

442.91 450.83 B: you know what i'm saying so it's kind of like you know illegal drugs we don't make any money off all that and you know there are billions of dollars worth of that so it's 

450.69 459.70 A: [noise] well we have a high a health crisis in america what do you believe we should do about the crisis two thirds of the people overweight 

459.73 461.40 A: what is your suggestion 

461.31 463.74 B: i haven't given it any thought 

463.82 465.36 B: [laughter] 

464.57 465.65 A: okay 

465.48 468.70 B: what about you sounds like you've uh given it some thought 

468.97 473.20 A: well yeah i mean i can i can see ahead uh uh 

473.35 486.24 A: in the future that uh not just uh two thirds i can see uh four out of five people being overweight and therefore not being able to perform uh uh their job correctly or live their lives uh 

486.05 494.84 A: the way uh they should and um i can see all kinds of complications for the the country if we don't do something about the problem 

488.32 489.15 B: uh-huh 

494.88 497.57 B: so how do you how do you get people off the couch 

498.98 508.24 A: yeah well i mean here in los angeles a lot of people tell me that the reason they don't get out there on their bicycles or um jogging uh running through the park 

508.13 514.09 A: is that the air is just so polluted that they feel they're actually doing their body more harm 

514.22 524.53 A: uh than good because uh they s- they claim that their lungs are are being filled with soot and dust and dirt and they're spitting black after a run through the park 

525.26 529.15 A: and they can't catch their breath and they say what good could that be doing me 

525.53 526.51 B: well then 

529.61 530.48 B: yeah 

529.73 539.17 A: i've heard that from more than one person here in l._a. now of course you've got a little bit better air [laughter] in phoenix than we got in l._a. i mean l._a. maybe the filthiest air in the united states 

532.48 533.50 B: (( oh it's just )) 

536.18 536.96 B: yeah 

539.61 545.73 B: but but it's not just l._a. that has the fitness problem so i mean that's not a universal 

539.67 540.65 A: uh 

546.54 552.69 A: no but uh your major cities is where you you find the the more uh people who are overweight 

552.69 560.29 A: i think a a lot of it has to do with the stress being put on people at work uh i think they need to have uh 

560.16 570.93 A: a place where they can relax at work uh and uh i think they need to be allowed to take more breaks and perhaps a longer break so they relieve the stress 

571.15 571.90 B: (( uh-huh )) 

571.26 575.84 A: and when you know when people are stressed out they tend to what eat comfort foods 

575.70 576.60 B: yeah 

576.00 579.40 A: they'll go down there and get a candy bar you know 

579.38 587.35 B: yeah well and you you have something there with the cities that you know in a city you have a fast food joint on every corner you get to a smaller town 

580.07 581.32 A: and that'll 

587.53 594.45 B: uh and there may only be one or two places you know that people actually eat in there there too so 

588.33 589.62 A: there it is 

594.81 596.42 B: yeah you're onto something there 

594.85 596.47 A: now have you a family 

596.61 599.34 B: (( do you have a family uh you're a single guy )) 

596.81 598.29 A: (( no i'm a )) 

598.40 599.89 A: (( single guy single guy y- ))
