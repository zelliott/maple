79.23 79.88 A: wha- 

80.89 90.67 A: yeah to basically visiting um help you know i can't print or how do i do this or setting up i'm setting up computers all the time or going you know 

86.17 86.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

90.71 93.36 A: upstairs downstairs taking uh 

93.39 97.59 A: broken equipment so uh i kind of look at that as my work out 

97.01 104.52 B: [noise] that's a stroke of luck i'm i do i do system administration so i'm tied to my terminal 

101.96 102.94 A: ah 

103.78 108.90 A: exactly well i had a i had a major long ago in computer science and then uh 

109.30 118.96 A: after after staring at screens for a while i figured hm [laughter] this is uh this is not as healthy as i'd like to be 

119.32 120.56 B: fair enough 

119.60 123.99 A: i guess how how funny so so what do you uh so what do you do 

124.22 126.07 A: health and fitness wise 

124.32 125.45 B: i'm bet- 

126.12 137.32 B: health and fitness wise i uh basically go to the gym three days out of the week lift for about an hour run for twenty minutes and then try and get as much walking in on weekends as i can 

137.22 138.64 A: mm mm 

138.03 143.99 B: um health wise i just try and take vitamins and eat reasonably regularly [laughter] 

138.88 140.61 A: (( you're not )) 

144.10 145.14 A: (( uh )) 

145.66 150.22 A: as well what what sort of system administration network or 

150.01 152.15 B: um actually i'm 

151.22 152.75 A: database or 

152.27 156.26 B: i administer to a large number of solaris web servers 

156.14 157.28 A: (( uh-huh )) 

158.45 159.93 A: which are uh 

160.84 162.38 A: keeping you busy 

162.25 165.07 B: yes quite on night shift no less 

164.95 169.61 A: i was i was going to say i mean whether there there's a like a limit to uh 

166.81 167.68 B: yeah 

170.28 174.91 A: this stuff i mean like the guys that are uh i mean a p- a p- a publishing uh firm 

175.48 179.19 A: and uh of course there's you know professional deadlines that are rolling 

179.65 185.32 A: around and uh so often enough they were you know the- these folks are burning the midnight oil 

185.45 191.23 A: but they're but they're not supposed to [laughter] whereas i guess that's your uh your mandate 

191.27 197.85 B: quite and it it makes exercise even more difficult on the up side i get to go to the gym during dead hours 

191.85 192.93 A: which is uh 

197.72 201.52 A: oh yeah yeah yeah yeah exact- well 

202.39 205.83 A: i was going to say if you find a gym that's open but then where do you 

207.25 213.04 A: when do you sleep i guess that's the other component here that in health fitness and sleep i think is part of the [laughter] 

212.58 218.15 B: uh it's tricky it's killing me by inches but for the next nine months or so i'm going to maintain 

218.23 224.57 B: sleeping from about uh mid late morning to uh mid late evening 

224.14 225.07 A: (( mm mm )) 

226.08 230.37 A: so how does how does this work with um your um your exercise schedule 

229.96 238.72 B: well i exercise when i get out of work the company has a gymnasium and even and it's basically the next building over from my office 

234.08 235.74 A: oh 

238.91 243.13 A: oh that's cool so then you so it's after work 

243.07 244.04 B: yes 

243.47 250.77 A: that you do this so i mean do you do you find that it it it does that then put enough fatigue into your system so that you're ready to sleep 

251.04 253.50 A: or does it work or does it work the other way 

251.19 252.20 B: um 

253.72 261.18 B: uh it doesn't seem to have an effect much one way or the other i get tired around dawn while i'm in the middle of the production cycle and then 

261.19 264.01 B: i don't get tired again until about mid morning 

263.72 264.71 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

265.49 279.24 B: i i learned in college that i regardless of exercise if i if i'm up all night i will get tired around ten a._m. one way or the other i usually find it easiest when i'm on a day schedule to wake up somewhere around eleven as a result 

279.20 281.61 A: uh-huh so you've so you've 

281.65 287.58 A: so this isn't uh you- your work schedule isn't anything that's like forced into your lifestyle it's just 

287.99 289.58 A: fitting in to the 

290.13 294.47 A: what uh what uh larks and owls is that the 

293.72 295.61 B: it's something like that yes 

295.78 298.48 A: that's 'cause i was reading reading something about um 

298.51 299.90 A: like the the 

300.15 303.55 A: the uh daily fluctuation in temperature 

303.70 304.65 B: yes 

303.93 313.41 A: um and and that somehow correlates with the sleep cycles and and some people get colder at different hours and and that's apparent when in other words the temperature starts dropping 

307.30 308.34 B: mhm 

313.49 316.39 A: the body temperature and that's sort of a cue for sleep 

313.77 314.66 B: yes 

315.93 320.40 B: [noise] i have a what's known as a post step circadian rhythm 

320.42 327.93 B: when basically stepped and stepped forward into the morning i i do not wake until eleven naturally 

320.58 321.97 A: [sigh] mm 

327.14 328.20 A: wow 

329.71 331.14 A: so 

331.32 337.13 A: you said for nine months the next nine months and then uh this is a contract affair or 

337.11 341.34 B: um no it's just um need based coverage 

341.56 342.81 A: (( mm mm )) 

343.98 350.54 B: but uh they've compensated me for the shift and i can't really object 

350.05 355.23 A: yeah plus you've plus you've got the gym [laughter] the gym next door 

353.50 354.88 B: exactly 

355.44 365.17 B: yeah a company gym is endlessly valuable to this sort of thing if i had to drive to drive to the gym before going home i don't think i would be able to do it 

355.65 356.63 A: [laughter] to a 

364.57 369.37 A: mm well how do you um your uh your cycles since you're 

365.41 366.17 B: (( my )) 

369.56 374.45 A: you're the you're the one on the schedule here how do you how do you determine that um 

375.34 380.55 A: if if as as far as i mean the exercise cycle i mean when and and and the things that you do 

375.57 377.14 B: how do i determine 

381.13 389.91 B: um well i use more or less the same exercise cycle i i've used any time i've actually been been motivated in my life towards exercise 

389.72 390.89 A: (( hm )) 

389.99 394.57 B: i simply know that three days a week is about right for um 

395.60 408.02 B: for for heavy lifting um 'cause i need at least a day in between and having a two day rest is actually useful because then after that it's easy to easier to change weights upward as i gradually improve 

397.62 398.69 A: (( mm )) 

407.40 409.00 A: uh-huh uh-huh [noise] 

408.87 416.07 B: uh just because muscle healing time uh the cardio is tossed on as an afterthought because i don't get much of it 

415.26 416.06 A: mm 

416.73 417.74 A: so 

417.75 422.03 A: i'm trying to remember whether there's a difference with with what little i know here 

422.50 425.98 A: since all i do is [laughter] is lift monitors and uh 

425.89 427.09 B: (( right [noise] )) 

426.34 428.43 A: and things um 

428.57 433.87 A: the endurance versus strength is that the 

433.42 440.44 B: um not i- in terms of in terms of um the lifting you mean the 

434.05 435.00 A: the 

435.10 436.34 A: (( the )) 

439.01 443.44 A: right right i mean you could either go for for building more and more 

443.39 445.23 B: you you can go for [noise] 

443.75 450.81 A: i mean i guess you do the same weights or it sounds like you're actually where you're going to you're trying to progress and get uh heavier and heavier 

451.20 457.04 B: uh there are a couple of ways you can go about it i actually uh was a fitness trainer for a couple of years 

451.53 452.56 A: weights 

456.46 458.42 A: uh-huh all right 

457.13 458.31 B: so 

458.60 460.59 B: um you can you can o- 

459.22 460.75 A: i've tapped into your 

460.88 461.65 B: right 

460.89 463.93 A: i've tapped into your area of expertise another one 

463.01 463.96 B: yes 

464.32 466.52 B: indeed you can uh 

465.15 466.38 A: educate me 

466.53 468.25 B: how did i what 

467.63 470.00 A: educate me [laughter] 

469.06 473.25 B: okay uh you basically have a couple of options when you're lifting weights 

472.77 474.78 A: mhm 

473.61 477.35 B: your three basic options are you can improve bulk 

477.46 479.98 B: you can improve tone 

477.50 478.31 A: (( mm )) 

480.30 487.12 B: uh just muscle tone or you can improve um basically the muscular endurance 

481.67 482.78 A: uh-huh 

487.38 488.44 A: uh-huh 

487.42 495.53 B: um and then there are subsets within each of these uh regarding how which approach you take to each of these uh goals 

495.70 502.08 A: and that and how um mutually exclusive are they i mean can you be working on all at once or 

502.18 509.95 B: um all will will s- will follow to a limited extent but if you really want to focus on something it is typically to the exclusion of the other two 

509.77 510.74 A: uh-huh 

509.97 520.73 B: then you you'll inadvertently build some bulk up to whatever level is needed for the weights you're at if you're working on endurance but after that you simply increase the number of reps rather than improving weight 

520.45 521.51 A: okay 

520.73 530.12 B: um if you're working on strength then you continue to increase the weight while keeping the the repetitions low if you're working on just muscle tone 

529.99 543.01 B: you start out at a weight that is in fact lighter than any than than anywhere near your current maximum and simply do very very large numbers of repetitions and that's the sort of schedule you can actually keep five to six days a week 

535.83 537.58 A: hm 

542.42 546.17 A: and then and what's that one for again that's for muscle tone hm 

545.48 547.41 B: muscle tone yes [noise] 

550.45 552.72 A: my um [sigh] 

552.83 558.78 A: i guess some some of my my background is actually um in in body work and massage as a 

559.07 561.52 A: as a sort of a side interest 

561.25 562.66 B: oh lovely 

562.01 566.90 A: in which it there that the emphasis is really on flexibility 

567.04 575.10 A: so the some of the literature that i'm reading you know or or have read is is very cautionary you know as far as weights 

575.49 577.63 A: and i'm i'm just wondering how uh 

578.14 582.20 A: not not having any [laughter] empirical experience whether 

582.34 587.43 A: it from from your experience whether whether that holds true or whether that's just a crock 

586.82 597.32 B: [noise] um flexibility is a very valid concern if you do not stretch uh when exercising you lose flexibility fairly quickly on almost any weight regimen 

597.11 597.95 A: mm 

597.58 599.66 B: um i 

598.24 599.89 A: so that th- that's part of your routin-
