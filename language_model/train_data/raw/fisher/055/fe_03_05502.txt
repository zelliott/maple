27.18 27.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

27.35 31.28 A: if schools are allowed to ban certain books public or private 

29.52 30.65 B: (( certain books )) 

31.46 35.73 B: (( yeah )) 

32.31 37.98 A: um my initial reaction to that would be no um 

39.19 46.00 A: i'd say obviously just because that's how i was raised uh 'specially uh any legitimate books that 

44.92 48.71 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] ))

63.92 65.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] it's like [noise] )) 

64.91 68.97 A: i would say with anything that has uh 

69.56 82.04 A: i guess extreme like pornography or stuff that maybe like y- you know you use your obvious you use your common sense you know at at a certain age at least for high school but 

77.25 81.10 B: (( yeah )) 

82.16 86.65 A: as far as books that have been known to be banned before like i mean 

86.66 89.39 A: order in a whole new millennium obviously 

88.61 89.91 B: yeah 

89.87 91.80 A: couldn't imagine uh 

92.56 96.49 A: banning anything right now i guess schools do it apparently but um 

92.68 95.48 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

95.66 101.36 B: [noise] yeah probably more the case in uh private school 

101.21 103.63 A: do you think the private schools have the right 

103.43 105.06 B: (( [noise] ah )) 

105.36 112.51 B: i think they have more clout or they can do whatever they want since they're private 

111.52 113.51 A: right 

112.55 114.51 B: but for public 

115.40 117.66 A: probably definitely not 

117.10 121.32 B: yeah 

118.57 119.98 A: and private 

120.98 123.04 A: (( [noise] that's a interesting [laughter] )) 

123.29 132.22 A: interesting position 'cause private schools are supposed to give a better education but they can be deterred in and way they'd like it's
