261.80 263.59 A: mhm 

262.38 265.98 B: to think oh that could have been me if i'd delayed it a month later 

267.20 268.02 B: (( mm )) 

269.22 270.84 B: [lipsmack] but um

277.43 278.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

278.99 284.97 A: (( i don't think anyone anyone will quit their job and leave new york to ))

286.54 288.54 B: le- yeah well it's it's 

288.94 297.98 B: that's a good point i mean if i was really scared um yeah i guess i would leave new york if i felt that it would definitely's gonna happen again 

298.32 299.28 B: um 

299.99 301.59 B: you know like i don't take 

301.68 305.76 B: chances and go to visit israel you know on vacation 

305.94 312.03 B: um i can't understand how a lot of people who live there are able to do that but um 

309.32 311.09 A: mhm 

312.24 313.81 B: yeah i think 

314.20 316.58 B: the way things are um 

316.87 319.22 B: with government um 

319.68 329.55 B: you know handling security on airplanes and and we've have a a couple of measures here in the in the city on how to increase police protection 

329.70 332.41 B: for uh major landmarks 

332.72 334.83 B: i just think it's more of a 

335.11 336.09 B: (( mm )) 

336.37 337.82 B: a governmental 

337.83 341.32 B: uh action that needs to take place but also it it's good for 

341.64 343.50 B: uh common every day people 

343.66 345.60 B: to uh watch 

345.78 353.56 B: what's going o- uh around them and if they see something particular then uh peculiar then to definitely say something but um 

354.79 360.86 B: yeah i would i leave the city o- o- only if i thought that there was really a great chance of 

355.44 357.21 A: (( yeah )) 

361.10 363.05 B: of an attack happening where 

363.16 364.25 B: um 

364.78 374.65 B: you know i would be affected but the odds you know in a city like new york uh that something could happen is relatively you know small the odds are better 

374.73 377.05 B: for you or me to be hit by a bus you know 

377.48 385.08 A: yeah right mhm or even likes of the the the snipers the sniper case 

379.79 380.94 B: so 

383.46 385.15 B: exactly 

386.37 388.44 A: (( even you know you know small )) 

388.96 393.22 A: if you just met some crazy people y- you can never see

409.96 411.79 A: mhm 

410.74 417.31 B: it's a different situation uh i guess because um a- i guess there are the uh 

418.13 424.54 B: the insurgency in what west in western china with the muslim area right 

425.03 426.76 B: are you familiar with that

441.81 442.87 B: um 

443.20 450.13 B: and that was another that's another consideration that's affected me in terms of do i wanna travel far away 

450.25 453.42 B: um from from the united states 

453.91 455.01 B: um 

456.25 462.28 B: like the the i was out of the country when it happened i was in italy and the next year 

462.37 467.34 B: uh i decided to take a a tri- a trip to

471.59 472.97 A: mhm 

472.34 474.45 B: terrorist activities because um 

474.96 480.64 B: it's harder i think for terrorists muslim terrorists to to blend in the kind of culture that way 

480.76 485.51 B: and um i'm thinking about another trip to go to malaysia 

485.67 488.20 B: and like vietnam and i'm wondering 

488.94 493.15 B: [lipsmack] am i going too far away from home

495.67 497.86 B: uh yes they do 

498.09 506.90 B: uh but i talked to some people and said well there's you know since nine eleven there's been a kind of a crack down where because malaysia doesn't want to lose 

507.14 518.19 B: you know western tourism and support um but that affects my mind and say should i really go to you know malaysia kuala lumpur or should i 

518.34 527.08 B: go a different country out there so that's kind of affecting me in a way not totally where i'm where i'm saying i won't go 

527.47 528.87 B: but um 

529.84 530.47 B: [noise] 

530.81 532.13 B: it's a concern
