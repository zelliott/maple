5.34 9.00 A: hi i'm eric yes i understand that too 

8.99 17.58 B: and it's a pretty sore subject with me it's one of the things that i feel that the government's steps in and they should keep their nose out of it 

18.46 22.10 A: uh well what do you mean do you mean the government steps in 

21.74 23.92 B: uh the government says what 

23.67 27.59 A: and does what and exercises censorship 

24.18 24.92 B: (( yes )) 

26.29 40.04 B: exercises censorship by backing the schools and different uh groups like uh trying to ban the pledge allegiance because it's got the word god in it or uh some of the uh 

39.85 47.10 B: churches banning certain books because of the fact that uh it doesn't go along with their religions and their teachings in school 

48.25 54.92 A: right well churches separation of church and state i'm churches can do what they want to do 

55.46 59.42 B: oh well that that's not the way i meant what i'm saying is that the 

59.45 63.19 B: different church groups trying to ban different books and different 

63.48 68.22 B: teachings in the public school system because it doesn't benefit their own cause 

68.00 72.49 A: oh yes yeah you're talking about evolution primarily i'm assuming 

70.42 72.36 B: evolution versus 

72.60 74.08 B: the biblical theme 

74.10 84.95 A: yeah and they've made a surprising amount of headway with that recently uh given that the scopes trial kind of resolved the issue [laughter] a long time ago 

85.87 91.10 B: well the thing about it is it's it's one of these things that uh 

91.80 101.76 B: your current your current your prior comment at separating church and state if the uh church doesn't like the public school system per se 

95.88 97.06 A: mhm 

101.82 109.12 B: they just take their kids out of it rather than trying to change it to suit them and use the taxpayer's money to 

109.19 110.71 B: push their cause 

115.85 117.21 A: yes 

118.00 120.51 A: but 

120.60 135.15 A: i'm i understand that that's a problem but i don't understand how the government could the government can't tell people that they can't can't tell parents that they can't take their children out of a public school and enroll them in a 

135.22 139.41 A: one with a more religious orientation provided 

138.85 143.39 B: no that's that's not uh that's not what i was trying to say what i'm saying is 

143.20 155.07 B: that the different religious groups so to speak trying to change the school system rather than taking their children out of it and schooling them in their own 

150.21 151.01 A: mhm 

155.17 157.65 A: oh i see i see what you mean 

155.60 156.95 B: their own methods 

157.87 170.62 B: uh it's like uh the language barrier so many different ethnic ethnic groups are trying to demand that we teach spanish french whatever in our school systems 

161.25 162.49 A: (( mhm )) 

170.56 171.74 A: mhm 

170.71 171.81 B: where 

172.37 176.42 B: english is our native language if you come over here 

177.08 188.79 B: you should have to learn our language so the same way with what our system teaches if you don't like it you drop out you don't like our books the government or your group takes the books away 

188.73 201.14 B: like uh i don't know which group started it but uh they banned tried to ban tom sawyer and little black sambo and huckleberry finn and a lot of the other 

201.31 204.02 B: older books in the public libraries 

203.96 205.86 A: mhm 

210.36 215.59 A: right well those weren't religious groups i think those were groups who objected to 

212.78 226.36 B: no but what i'm saying i'm just using using one of the ethnic groups and such as this everybody wants their own way rather well this is the way it is set up by the majority of the people 

217.28 218.49 A: mhm 

226.25 227.30 A: right 

226.70 229.49 B: if you don't like it leave it 

229.12 243.53 A: right well i you raise an interesting point with bringing up the ethnic groups and huckleberry finn and that's that censorship isn't just a [noise] liberal versus conservative issue you have liberal people who 

243.31 250.08 A: want to censor a certain who want to exercise censorship as well as conservatives 

249.90 264.83 B: it it goes along with their censorship goes along with it makes no difference you can use abortion you can use the gun group you can use the smoking group i either like or don't like one so they try to force their issues 

251.91 253.24 A: mhm 

264.83 269.45 B: i don't like this so i'm going to tell you that it's bad and we should ban it so to speak 

269.35 270.47 A: mhm 

269.86 275.02 B: no matter what it is and to me that's the censorship in the schools with some of the books 

276.20 277.97 B: and i don't advocate 

278.05 283.54 B: pornography but just where do you draw the line as to 

284.37 287.76 B: how people you know what i'm saying how people uh 

288.07 294.06 B: opinion have their opinions on something what is good for you is good for something else uh is bad for somebody else 

294.20 295.96 A: mhm 

297.75 300.42 B: i was at a protest a few months ago 

300.61 308.56 B: driving by and asked the ladies what they were protesting about and they said they were protesting the 

309.07 313.27 B: dirty movie business up on the corner this was in 

313.28 327.56 B: a mid missouri town and they asked me what i thought about it and i said well i don't go there but do you think you have the right to take these people's constitutional rights away from them instead of censoring it it 

327.67 329.66 B: broke the group up 

329.36 330.61 A: mhm 

329.88 331.21 B: they couldn't answer it 

331.25 333.44 A: mhm 

333.87 343.36 A: no i agree with you they have the right to criticize that business certainly and they should feel free to do so if they feel that it's 

336.87 337.72 B: right 

343.86 347.41 A: unethical they can say so but 

346.97 355.28 B: but to keep it keep somebody else's views just because i don't like it or going to ban it that's the part that i don't like 

354.70 356.85 A: mhm 

355.97 358.70 B: it makes no difference what your views are 

358.97 368.93 B: religiously governmental or anything else i may disagree with you but i'll stand right beside you and argue the fact that we've both got our rights to what we believe in 

369.24 377.35 A: so what do you think about libraries then increasingly increasingly they're restricting what people can use the internet for 

374.78 376.13 B: i think that if 

376.54 387.96 B: i think if they banned anything at all they should lose all of their government support period state local and county levels if you banned anything at all 

379.23 380.96 A: mhm 

387.98 390.12 B: makes no difference what it is 

390.46 395.40 B: then you lose everything i'm not saying that they should give 

395.86 399.17 B: school age children an open computer 

399.18 404.28 B: i think there should have to be a little bit more like parental control 

399.23 400.34 A: mhm 

404.15 405.44 A: mhm 

404.83 419.33 B: but as far as the government saying what my children can see now and i'll have to clarify that i'm a grandfather and i've i've seen a lot of the world but what i'm saying is it is not up to the government at any level 

412.12 413.22 A: mhm 

419.47 421.35 B: to ban anything 

421.77 424.11 B: that's what our constitution is all about 

423.34 425.52 A: to ban any form of expression 

425.53 427.21 B: yes that's i mean 

427.23 432.15 B: you can't ban that's that's getting into the first amendment and the freedom of speech 

431.98 432.97 A: mhm 

432.24 434.67 B: makes no difference what they're banning 

434.84 438.64 B: they're jumping on somebody's constitutional rights 

438.49 443.49 A: well we have made exceptions to the first amendment for hate crime though 

443.71 446.18 A: do you think those are justified 

445.60 446.81 B: no i don't 

450.17 456.32 B: and now i i have no idea who you are or what you are and you know know nothing about me 

456.12 457.10 A: mhm 

456.49 469.27 B: so let's just we can use this either you're the good guy or i'm the bad good guy it makes no difference i'm black or white you're black or white and i make a remark to you that is a racist remark 

470.24 474.68 B: all of a sudden because of all the government bans and the hate crimes 

474.91 481.83 B: all of a sudden it becomes a hate crime just because you or i one made the statement against the other's 

482.19 485.77 B: racial or ethnic background and that's wrong 

485.60 486.88 A: mhm 

487.39 498.24 B: i mean just because i'm i'm black or i'm white and everything i can't go say well he told me i was a white honky or i was a 

498.99 510.91 B: a dirty jap or a crazy german or whatever and i can call in the government and i can push it and have you investigated on charges of hate crime and that's wrong 

510.82 515.06 A: oh you can probably you could probably have me arrested if someone witnessed us 

513.37 514.58 B: oh yes 

515.72 517.88 B: and and that is totally wrong 

519.50 521.77 B: i mean it is so 

521.01 524.02 A: where do you draw the line though between 

524.32 532.75 A: obviously if something is a threat of violence or could be construed as a threat of violence by a reasonable person 

533.94 534.93 B: well 

534.29 537.86 A: do you then think the government has a right to 

537.44 538.59 B: no i don't 

539.50 549.07 B: i have to go along with one of the things and i have been in law enforcement as a reserve i've never been a commissioned officer other than the military 

543.93 544.99 A: mhm 

547.53 548.74 A: mhm 

549.48 551.55 B: but my thing is 

551.88 562.82 B: you can threaten anybody in the world but the president and until you commit the crime there's nothing the law can legally do about it in the hate crime it's different 

562.46 563.73 A: mhm 

563.12 564.81 B: and that's wrong 

565.54 577.93 B: what what gives the government or any organisation the right to say well let's just use the clan for instance and i don't believe in it but again like everything else everybody has their rights 

577.82 578.85 A: mhm 

578.32 581.04 B: we're having a peaceful rally 

581.33 588.13 B: somebody drives by and sees us running around with our funky hats and our white sheets they call the law 

588.95 591.60 B: they come up and say all right we've got 

591.86 597.03 B: a report of a hate crime going on there arrest everybody and they're not bothering anybody 

596.85 598.06 A: mhm 

597.57 599.89 B: uh i saw geraldo go to jail for that
