243.43 248.58 A: yeah i mean they're awesome you know and like in college i think well college students

254.47 255.69 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

261.74 262.47 A: like 

261.79 263.43 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

262.60 271.40 A: heart diseases i mean it it does a lot you know if you're never active you know then i think you you live less if you're less active too 

272.13 279.05 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] the trick is when you're young a lot of people get into exercise you know running or riding bikes 

272.47 273.23 A: (( uh )) 

279.12 281.34 B: bicycling or treadmill 

281.58 282.45 A: yeah 

281.66 291.54 B: lifting the weights and all that and they do that when they're young when they feel good and and they're in good health and that's good for them but the trouble is when 

283.82 284.58 A: yeah 

291.72 299.23 B: they get older and they get to forty fifty sixty [noise] the older they get the more or less they're likely they are to do that and that's when they need it the most 

299.35 311.32 A: yeah exactly i mean i you know i go to the gym and i've seen all the people work out i mean that's awesome 'cause you know it keeps your muscles you know going if you don't exercise you know your muscles start you know 

305.51 306.24 B: [noise] 

311.25 318.89 A: it like you know it's it's definitely very good for like muscles as well as you know your heart and inside i mean it's uh 

319.17 321.10 A: and also you know it 

321.12 326.78 A: keeps you in shape when you you know like if you're like overweight you know running definitely helps out and you know 

327.21 337.92 A: it does i mean there are so many benefits that i mean i don't think anyone can argue saying that you know exercise is not good for you i mean it's i don't think you know it's not it's not really an argument 

331.12 332.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

338.34 344.24 A: it's more like you know uh some people do it more some people do it less and just different ways to exercise but 

344.29 346.85 A: as long as there's any kind of you know physical activity 

347.14 349.57 A: that's all you know that's what's important 

349.47 350.07 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

350.68 351.34 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

351.71 353.49 A: so that's what i think 

353.60 359.13 B: [noise] yeah i think that the trick here is to work it in with your daily activities somewhere you know 

358.90 364.38 A: yeah i mean def- uh definitely you know it's definitely um a good idea like you know if you 

362.95 363.70 B: [noise]

373.52 375.69 B: (( i think you gotta keep that up [noise] )) 

375.96 388.62 A: yep like you said you know if you if you know you know you can take a car and go to the store a few minutes away where if you can you know walk or jog there and know that you could prefer to jog and i mean it'll take more time but it would be some 

387.39 391.67 B: jogging and walking is just as good as jogging i think [noise] 

391.39 395.57 A: yeah and uh you know it takes time but it benefits you you know i mean 

395.05 396.99 B: yeah 

396.31 403.14 A: it's you know it's definitely good for you and how about yourself when you when you were younger did you uh play any sports or
