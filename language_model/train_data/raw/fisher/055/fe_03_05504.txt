1.62 3.36 B: [noise] jose monferro 

3.17 5.03 A: chris gibson 

5.34 6.75 A: hello 

6.33 7.50 B: hello 

7.26 8.22 A: hi 

8.11 9.79 B: hey what's up [noise] 

9.08 10.61 A: (( not much how about yourself )) 

10.55 14.70 B: [noise] anyway um what what do they want us to talk about 

14.05 23.44 A: yeah it's about um whether you think people should uh or uh public and private schools are allowed to tell you what to read and what not to read 

18.44 19.65 B: ban books 

23.84 28.39 B: okay um what's your take on it chris 

28.04 29.91 A: well i think that uh 

31.68 40.56 A: [lipsmack] depending on the content of the book uh you know little kids shouldn't be reading big kids stuff uh i'll say that 

40.19 41.42 B: um 

41.45 52.38 B: well i think since it's a private school which means it's a privately owned institution funded by like the parents because it they should be allowed to charter their own laws 

52.93 56.58 B: and that includes uh the readings syllabus 

57.70 61.99 B: (( but i i don't know that's what i think )) 

57.73 58.30 A: (( yeah )) 

60.68 64.19 A: (( mhm you got a good point on that but uh )) 

64.97 67.94 B: unless you're making them read like 

68.01 70.72 B: like th- really bad books [laughter] 

70.07 72.34 A: yeah yeah 

70.82 73.91 B: like how to hit your mom or something i don't know 

75.61 81.80 A: yeah uh i think somebody uh i talked to before goes so that that 

81.95 86.42 A: they find a book and it it listed chemical components 

86.56 87.51 A: uh 

88.69 90.37 A: for making a bomb [mn] 

91.01 94.24 A: things like that shouldn't be in school i don't think 

93.46 102.66 B: [noise] [noise] well if a school had that in it it probably wouldn't be a a good school [laughter] like i think there there would be a problem with like the school in general not necessarily with 

98.01 99.82 A: yeah 

103.09 104.49 B: the book syllabus 

104.40 105.26 A: (( mm )) 

109.34 110.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

109.93 113.39 A: so i i guess we could both say that uh 

113.57 119.14 A: [noise] it's all right if they keep an eye on [noise] what out on the bookshelves 

115.53 116.24 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

118.51 120.50 B: mhm 

119.44 121.29 A: (( but um you know )) 

123.44 127.14 B: [noise] yeah or wait do we get paid for this [laughter] 

127.03 128.78 A: [laughter] i don't know 

128.53 133.07 B: i don't i don't know [laughter] anyway um 

133.36 136.63 B: yeah well that's basically what i 

136.91 143.98 B: my take on it i mean i wasn't i never went through it like private school so i wouldn't know much about 

144.75 146.85 B: having books banned or 

147.63 157.71 A: i went to a private school but there was no books that we read that weren't banned uh i don't i can't think of any books off the top of my head that were banned 

158.61 159.39 B: mm 

159.96 164.12 A: do you know of any or that you've heard of 

162.08 163.58 B: (( [noise] well )) 

163.83 171.88 B: well i'm sure if you go to a catholic school they would ban any books on like on like pagan religion or something [laughter] i don't i don't know 

172.08 180.02 A: well we we have stuff on that because uh at the school i went to we we did research projects uh for years 

180.11 181.28 A: and uh 

182.16 190.22 A: well that that was the topic for some of the beginning classes was uh over different religions and 

190.38 194.65 A: they use those books as research references 

196.39 198.17 B: [noise] [noise] [mn] i mean 

198.28 201.79 B: i went to a pretty public high school they never banned 

204.08 205.99 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

204.28 210.14 B: and yeah the reading list was pretty constant 

210.36 211.35 B: every year 

214.44 215.32 B: (( [noise] )) 

216.06 217.77 B: (( [mn] yeah and )) 

218.14 227.65 B: our our library was real like each book was like hand picked by the by the school so maybe that that is kinda like censorship 

224.13 225.31 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

226.63 229.97 A: yeah we had one catholic school in uh 

230.22 232.92 A: my city that closed and uh 

234.30 245.72 A: w- when it closed the school that i go to received a bunch of their books but ever since then the librarian orders you know books that are on demand from the students 

242.20 243.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

245.65 246.66 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

246.02 247.48 A: but i believe that's 

247.70 251.06 A: that's about the only way we get books is through donations and 

251.39 255.03 A: what the students want to read 

254.64 255.87 B: (( [noise] [noise] hm )) 

258.22 259.02 B: [noise] 

259.32 260.19 B: (( oh )) 

260.42 263.38 B: well i couldn't like care less [laughter] i mean 

264.70 265.92 B: about that [noise] 

266.62 270.41 A: what if they're going to ban books and stuff 

271.34 272.40 B: (( hm [noise] )) 

274.03 275.01 B: (( well [cough] )) 

276.83 281.44 B: well i don't know like my school now i mean it has like 

282.64 283.43 B: [noise] 

286.29 287.64 B: array of like books 

288.54 298.57 A: could you say that again i think you cut out for a little bit you went blank for a little bit could you repeat what you just said 

297.24 302.11 B: [noise] i said my school now has like a large array of like books of all types 

301.57 302.96 A: oh oh 

302.85 305.31 B: 'cause it's like a college library so 

304.86 306.27 A: (( oh i see )) 

305.69 308.18 B: and it's pretty private too [laughter] i don't 

307.54 308.39 A: (( oh )) 

309.61 310.72 B: (( know )) 

311.85 316.96 B: but that's like freedom of speech and freedom of like friends i guess 

316.93 318.64 A: yeah 

317.83 319.65 B: you can read whatever you want 

323.15 324.28 B: (( [cough] )) 

324.90 326.26 B: (( [sigh] [mn] um )) 

327.80 329.86 B: okay s- so 

330.05 331.63 B: is it like ten minutes 

332.58 337.60 A: so that it it'll tell you when it's once it hits that point 

337.07 339.92 B: and are we supposed to talk about it like the whole ten minutes [laughter] 

339.58 341.21 A: yeah 

340.59 342.69 B: oh okay um 

345.83 347.84 B: [mn] um oh 

348.54 349.64 B: i mean um 

349.66 350.75 B: i'm sure 

351.34 359.83 B: like the only reason why any books would be banned is if it actually causes any harm to anyone like that staten bomb thing you mentioned [noise] 

356.98 358.92 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

361.30 366.96 A: [noise] i was reading that 'cause it wasn't banned here it might have been banned but it was still found on the shelf 

368.50 370.23 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

370.60 371.16 B: (( [mn] )) 

371.02 375.46 B: i wouldn't want to read it like a book about like bombs or anything or how to make them 

375.45 387.03 B: but i think that if someone wanted to like read something like that they should go to like public library and i mean if you could just like read a chemistry text book and like figure it out [laughter] 

381.85 383.80 A: (( [noise] hm )) 

386.30 388.36 A: yeah yeah 

393.22 394.98 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

395.03 396.63 B: (( but um )) 

399.26 400.77 B: (( free to do what you want )) 

405.05 406.57 B: (( i guess [noise] )) 

406.28 411.82 A: so do you think that the penalties are high if you uh bring a book that's banned into a school 

413.59 415.18 B: penalties 

414.50 415.57 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

415.65 418.19 B: (( well i i think they should just like )) 

418.79 427.41 B: like remind students that it's banned and um it'll it'll be really like senseless to punish the student for bringing a banned book 

427.67 433.17 B: that's like that's like weird like you don't punish someone for bringing a book i 

434.38 435.36 B: (( mean )) 

435.76 437.44 B: it's it's like [mn] 

438.47 440.55 B: freedom of speech in a way 

440.59 442.40 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

443.52 450.50 B: but i don't i i don't i'm not a like a good debater so i i wouldn't be able to defend that point of view 

451.97 453.08 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

455.15 456.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

463.34 466.34 B: (( but [noise] [mn] )) 

466.46 471.20 B: so what you are y- like 

471.90 474.35 B: do you still are at school now 

474.81 478.50 A: [mn] no no i graduated uh this past year 

478.70 479.86 B: (( oh okay )) 

480.77 491.27 B: yeah i just like started college so i mean i i haven't really explored my library as much but i'm sure there's like plenty of book about pretty much anything there 

483.52 484.78 A: yeah 

490.96 496.46 A: yeah my four years i didn't get to see all of my library either 

493.01 493.73 B: [noise] 

498.27 498.83 B: (( [mn] )) 

503.59 505.41 B: yeah 

509.59 510.49 B: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

510.77 511.33 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

512.59 513.59 B: (( okay i )) 

514.90 517.42 B: (( don't know like )) 

518.58 525.99 B: i don't know people want to censor stuff they shouldn't as long as it's not like violating everyone's rights i guess 

525.54 527.75 A: mhm 

527.79 530.64 A: but how would you draw the boundary 

530.52 531.35 B: (( [noise] )) 

531.39 532.94 B: well once 

533.52 537.92 B: [cough] if it's i mean if it's a senseless censorship 

538.39 546.60 B: where like [noise] i mean if the majority prob- the majority not even the majority if like at least one person 

546.67 555.44 B: like wants to read something which is banned i think that's like unconstitutional [noise] that it's banned at all since 

555.65 563.54 B: i mean you used to be able to like get any book or any you know get like any book as long as it doesn't like [noise] 

563.57 567.32 B: it's not teaching you how to like break the law i guess 

570.79 576.71 B: [noise] [mn] unless you go to private school and want to read a book that is banned at your school [mn] just go to a library and get it 

575.85 577.75 A: (( [noise] i see [noise] yeah )) 

577.24 583.76 B: so then they couldn't like it's not they're prohib- p- prohibited from like reading that book ever 

583.93 584.68 B: (( [noise] )) 

584.74 596.03 A: [noise] well my school was pretty strict uh the one i went to but i'm not too sure what their point of view would be if you brought a book that was banned by the school itself [noise] [noise] 

595.40 599.67 B: i mean how would they find it anyway i mean that's are they going to go through your stuff
