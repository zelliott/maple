292.37 298.59 A: oh in the service well first of all if you know if you were heavier when you were in the service 

298.62 301.48 A: they had ways of [laughter] of getting you 

301.69 311.28 A: to lose weight there was like three or four guys and when we used to go in the in the charles you know into the mess hall you used to have a bar 

311.44 320.93 A: and the sergeant would tell you by according to your weight how many pull ups you had to do and if you didn't do the required amount if he said do five and you did four you went back to the end of the line 

321.64 323.42 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

322.35 328.32 A: and you keep doing this in other words if he sent you back and there was ten people and then you came up and you didn't do it and you keep 

328.42 330.30 A: see and then in turn 

330.71 334.90 A: that and usually every morning [noise] you used to [cough] 

335.33 341.52 A: after the first two weeks you know once you get orientated and everything [cough] and you go into the training aspect of it 

341.67 343.02 A: you used to run 

343.38 347.16 A: usually [noise] when we first started we used to run close to a mile 

347.94 353.32 A: whether you were able to or not [noise] whether you were heavier fat you know whatever 

352.90 356.55 B: would they have do they have to walk then if they couldn't make it if they couldn't run it 

355.22 366.04 A: right right [noise] and then eventually he did and you know when where i was stationed at in fort knox kentucky they had a when we came back 

366.53 369.52 A: after your six week physical bivouac 

370.73 375.98 A: where you walked twenty eight twenty five to twenty eight miles i knew exactly 

370.87 371.87 B: (( what's that )) 

376.14 378.35 A: the last two miles 

378.36 379.96 A: were up a hill 

381.00 393.79 A: that you can't im- if you can imagine went almost straight up and you come to the top of it and come down we went like maybe a quarter of a block and then our barracks were there and that was the end of it full 

384.91 386.33 B: did you get a break at all 

394.23 402.72 A: quip you know with your pack and the whole bit and everything and when i was in the service i only weighed about a hundred and five pounds 

403.67 404.81 A: when i went in 

405.27 408.57 A: after basic training i weighed a hundred and twenty some pounds 

409.07 414.66 A: i gained about fifteen to seventeen pounds in a six to eight week period 

414.29 415.81 B: was that all muscle then 

416.54 429.48 A: more so because you know the training [noise] peri- you know [noise] it keeps you that way because when you're in uh basic training you can't go you can't eat any really any junk food 'cause you can't go anywhere 

429.76 434.29 A: you're actually staying you know where you're supposed to in the barracks and so forth 

432.69 433.50 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

433.56 434.73 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

435.36 448.05 A: i'm not saying you couldn't have you know candy or something or other but you y- you very seldom had a lot of junk food you know like hotdogs and fries and stuff like that and pizza and y- you didn't get too much of that while you were in training 

437.06 438.21 B: [noise] 

448.80 454.86 A: now after you were finished you know your basic training and everything and you went into whatever field you were into 

454.87 461.91 A: according to what your your what they call your m._o._s. is and mine fortunately was i went into uh cooking 

457.67 459.85 B: mhm 

462.85 464.93 A: and i went back to the same area 

465.24 466.69 A: [noise] after your 

466.66 467.22 B: (( [cough] )) 

467.20 471.62 A: basic training is they give you i think i think it was a two week leave 

472.15 476.74 A: [noise] or ten t- t- ten to twelve day leave and then after that [noise] 

476.76 477.65 A: you 

477.85 484.61 A: came back and you went to your your mo- wherever your whatever they put you in some were in cooks some were uh 

484.79 498.78 A: [noise] in special training like infantry and some were in in where we were stationed at they had tanks and so forth it was very you know that part of it you know was very interesting the only thing is i was only seventeen and a half 

490.05 492.83 B: mhm 

499.00 501.76 B: really mhm 

499.07 505.97 A: when i went in mhm you you have to be eighteen but if you have a s- signature of your parents you could go in 

506.19 508.21 B: oh all right 

506.22 513.24 A: which i did the only bad part is when i was finished with the cooking i went over i went to germany 

514.05 520.96 A: and i didn't hit my eighteenth birthday until i was actually in germany i was only in germany for 

520.99 525.25 A: two days the second day was my birthday i was eighteen 

525.94 526.52 B: (( mm )) 

526.79 527.86 A: so 

528.02 530.95 A: and when you're over there when you're that young you you know 

531.17 533.59 A: you have a lot to learn 

531.21 532.62 B: did you still have to do 

532.74 537.07 B: do y- did you still have a fitness routine over in germany too did they make you or 

537.77 545.64 A: um no not as much there but there was a um p- pretty nice area where you could if you wanted to 

545.51 557.41 A: but see when you were over there where i was stationed if you wanted to go you know like to the guest houses that's what they call them they're bars or whatever or places to eat from the barracks you had to walk 

557.71 564.48 A: so you actually got a lot of um exercise in that respect if you went from the um 

565.03 573.45 A: the k- you know where you were stationed at and you wanted to go into town the town was at least a mile mile and a half away so you're talking you used to walk 

573.98 581.47 A: usually it's on the weekends usually got if you got a pass for the weekend then you had it for like two days you used to walk back and forth you'd probably walk 

581.56 585.12 A: four or five miles for sure every weekend 

585.01 585.85 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

585.82 591.02 A: and then during the regular week you had to be back in before twelve at night 

591.27 593.94 A: and you finished working at 

594.04 599.95 A: i think it was at five i think close to five or five thirty was when you were done so they really didn't give you a
