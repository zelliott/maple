104.36 117.76 A: right [laughter] yeah that's i- that's not funny but i mean it's so ironic because my friend's birthday is like september eleventh as well and she was the exact same way she was like this is like my day 

117.72 146.49 A: i even remember seeing like an episode of that on like friends or something where like it was like something like it was their birthday and they're like no it can't be it was like [noise] oh no you know what it was it was the real world [noise] like one of their birthdays or something and it happened yeah [noise] [noise] yeah well i guess that kinda changed you a little bit since like now every day that it's your birthday you like automatically probably that pops in your head 

121.15 122.30 B: really [laughter] 

128.96 130.36 B: oh oh [laughter] 

131.50 139.47 B: yeah it di- it did it frustrates me like that was my day or whatever but i mean [laughter] obviously that's really selfish but it was just frustrating 

143.30 145.01 B: (( right all the )) 

145.67 151.38 B: i was al- well and i also live down the street i actually live on the jersey side of the hudson river 

151.32 163.78 B: and so when you walk down my street you look at the trade towers where they were like they would be rising up like really close and now they're not there so that sucks like that was a gorgeous skyline and it's not there anymore 

158.43 159.15 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] a- [noise] )) 

158.94 163.45 A: (( yeah )) 

163.32 175.91 A: oh definitely yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah it definitely was i remember like before like um 

164.18 168.49 B: and like it was just it's sucks like i i r- 

168.53 171.90 B: they're putting up that new stuff but it looks weird i don't know 

175.86 184.86 A: i think it was like a year before it was the last time i was in new york and i went well actually first we were at um liberty state park 'cause we went to see this concert there 

184.28 185.19 B: right 

184.69 195.69 A: and i remember me and my friend just saying to each other like wow that is such an awesome like backdrop for like a radiohead show and it was so on scene yeah 

192.17 196.33 B: is that what you went to see oh i love radiohead they're my favorite group 

195.75 205.46 A: yeah they are awesome but we went there and it was like so cool 'cause like we're watching this great band and in the background you got like the twin towers and the rest of manhattan 

196.65 197.79 B: yeah 

205.12 206.22 B: yeah 

205.34 217.67 A: and like i remember the next time i went i was at um liberty state park for some reason and um i just remember standing there like oh my god i cannot believe that they're not there anymore i just 

209.74 210.74 B: uh-huh 

215.16 218.96 B: yeah it really the skyline was completely different yes 

218.10 232.33 A: yeah it's like it seemed like that way but i mean it and it's a shame like all those people died but like in my personal life like i didn't know anybody there and like it really like bothered me when it happened and stuff but like as far as like me like 

232.09 239.45 A: not [noise] flying or like taking precautions that way it really has not done anything to me [noise] [noise] 

235.29 236.66 B: right 

238.44 242.94 B: no it didn't affect affect me that way at all either um 

244.30 246.81 B: [mn] only like 

248.22 259.85 B: i guess like somewhat in this area like people stayed in more and stayed at home more and with the whole say we think even the fact and i'm a waiter and that hurt business a lot so people didn't go out to eat as much at all 

251.24 255.35 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

256.72 261.26 A: (( [noise] oh yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

259.86 261.55 B: ah it was 

261.63 269.49 B: it was cool that people were spending more time at home with the family and everything but you know my family's not up here so it was just like 

261.76 266.22 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

266.04 278.75 A: oh yeah definitely [noise] i guess like the c- the closer you are to new york city like in that respect it's probably like people there more so were probably more le- more affected than like on a 

276.81 278.51 B: oh yeah 

278.60 281.66 A: personal level than like [noise] 

279.81 282.37 B: it was really morbid around here for a while 

281.83 290.08 A: yeah [noise] i remember going to like one time we went to new york after it happened and we just went to the we went to like where it where the trade center was 

289.35 290.27 B: uh-huh 

290.06 297.91 A: and it was like so it like i felt it more so when once i was actually there and saw it than like when i was watching it on t._v. 'cause like 

297.69 312.30 A: you could see anything happen on television you know i mean they have movies where you spend millions of dollars and they'll make anything happen but like so like watching it on t._v.'s one thing but when you when we went up there it was so insane just like i cannot believe that like 

312.06 324.86 A: not only are these h- humongous buildings gone but like all those people died and everything else it's just really weird but like the next day i mean i went about my business i i mean i've been on like six airplanes since then so 

318.56 320.05 B: yeah 

324.65 327.11 B: oh yeah it didn't affect me flying 

326.39 339.17 A: [noise] yeah i mean i know my one friend she um [noise] that i work with she was supposed to go um on a business trip and she refused to go 'cause like she's like i'm not flying osama bin laden and this and that and i'm like 

327.17 328.09 B: (( but ah )) 

336.51 340.46 B: really yes some people can't yeah 

339.31 343.73 A: i'm like yo if that [laughter] happens you're not supposed to be here anyway so 

343.07 348.73 B: [laughter] what'd she say when you said that [laughter] 

343.94 346.00 A: [laughter] you know it's like 

346.22 348.99 A: [laughter] 

348.81 355.37 A: i don't know but it's kinda weird i guess it's affected other people more so than me i'm the kinda person where like [noise] m- 

348.82 350.12 B: that's probably 

355.34 364.70 A: something will happen and i'll think about it for ten minutes but like i'll totally be over in like the eleventh minute like anything like not just like stuff like that but like 

361.65 362.73 B: right 

364.07 365.06 B: right right 

364.59 377.00 A: i mean sure it's important and you know and everything else but like [noise] personally i just don't like to dwell on stuff like that i'd rather think about things that are like [noise] more personal and more pertinent to me than 

376.31 377.43 B: right right 

376.87 389.77 A: stuff that could and may happen but you know [noise] it's gonna happen if it's gonna happen [noise] yeah [laughter] [noise] [noise]
