2.27 3.44 B: hi how are you 

3.31 4.81 A: (( good how are you all )) 

4.40 7.33 B: uh i've had a shitty day but other than that i'm okay 

7.01 8.63 A: right that sounds fine then 

8.78 13.21 B: yeah uh what was the topic what changes have we made since september eleven 

9.69 10.61 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

13.07 14.65 A: right 

14.44 17.46 B: uh not too much more hassle at airports i 

16.75 22.61 A: [noise] i know i would say basically almost like nothing at all you know everyone makes a big deal out of it deal about it 

22.64 23.69 A: um 

23.49 31.39 B: mean it was it was certainly a big deal at the time and it certainly still is a big deal but changes in my life i'm not gonna walk around being scared all the time 

23.75 24.69 A: yeah 

30.79 34.54 A: right i think most people haven't really changed their daily life um 

34.77 45.77 A: basically the only thing i'm sure to get at the airport earlier you know and you kinda notice a few other things but maybe you look at somebody differently at the airport but i don't know beyond that it's hard to say even from other people 'cause 

45.66 56.02 B: yeah i don't think we're really much safer i mean [laughter] in any way shape or form with all the stuff at the airport and i miss not having being able to put a nail clipper or little scissors or something in your bag but 

55.45 57.90 A: r- right i know i agree with that it's 

56.93 63.43 B: aside from the inconvenience um i mean i don't mind the additional security at the airport it's just could maybe be set up better 

61.37 62.63 A: (( yeah me neither )) 

63.78 70.98 B: you know it's just kind of amusing watching some of the people getting all upset 'cause they have to take their shoes off or something like that 

70.46 74.34 A: right and have that actually you see that new thing they have it's uh 

74.55 76.48 A: it's like an x ray thing and it 

75.65 82.31 B: yeah where it scans the body and people are getting all freaked out 'cause they're gonna see what they look like naked i mean give me a break who cares 

77.28 78.66 A: yeah 

80.50 81.51 A: right 

82.00 86.14 A: i don't know it just i don't know it was just pretty that that was one like c._n._n. dot com or whatever 

85.66 90.35 B: yeah i mean you know they would flash so everybody can see what everybody looks like and uh 

90.17 90.97 A: (( [noise] no )) 

90.81 93.22 B: i'm not saying we should go that far but 

92.54 95.26 A: yeah i don't know yeah that would be interesting 

95.01 107.41 B: you know i i i really don't let it bother me i mean in the in the regular part of life i mean there are times now that i will drive when i might have flown immediately afterwards september eleventh 

106.96 108.21 A: mhm 

107.39 110.75 B: just because the airports were so screwed up 

110.31 114.65 A: right yeah immediately after's different but you know this is like two years down the line and 

113.67 118.72 B: yeah i mean now i have uh zero difference in my life 

118.86 126.59 B: uh as far as that goes i mean it certainly i think has helped hurt the economy even worse than it was in to begin with 

126.19 127.76 A: oh right yeah [mn] 

127.16 136.34 B: and we haven't gotten ourselves back from that yet and certainly you know hurting uh most people at least a little bit in the pocketbooks certainly hurt me in my pocketbook 

135.93 142.59 A: i know i'll be look for uh a job in about like year so hopefully in that time things can recover 

143.71 145.39 B: uh why are you at school now 

145.28 146.54 A: yeah 

148.04 150.87 B: uh hopefully by then things will be better 

150.26 155.82 A: i know but i'm trying yeah i'm trying to think of anything that's really different i ha- can't say for me 

154.14 160.11 B: no no i mean i i uh in some ways they've promoted me for having to shift jobs 

160.13 161.12 A: uh-huh 

160.61 162.55 B: what i was doing before 

162.51 166.86 B: but i think i'm happier doing what i'm doing now than what i was doing before so 

166.66 179.44 B: you know i'm negative one and i i know some people in my wife's family who are just still freaked out you know in their when they're flying like they're they're waiting for it but i don't believe you live your life that way 

166.68 167.97 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

179.27 185.36 A: no i know i mean you think you've gotta be rational about it you know there's a thousand flights a day know what i mean 

183.69 190.86 B: yeah i mean it's the same thing i mean there's like horrible storms and you hear a plane crash when my flights called i just get on the plane i don't care

197.92 198.49 A: (( [mn] )) 

199.73 205.18 A: i know you just gotta let and uh look at the logic the the rational you're not it's unlikely 

204.56 211.05 B: yeah i ha- have news for you i don't think anybody's gonna try to hijack an american plane anymore 'cause they know the passengers are gonna rise up 

210.53 212.08 A: exactly 

212.81 215.01 A: [noise] i don't know what else can i think of here

235.06 236.14 A: yeah 

239.01 246.44 A: no you can get you can actually get a cheap ticket if you're a student eighteen to twenty two you can get a ticket for fifty bucks one way you just walk into the airport

247.57 248.81 A: yeah 

248.25 251.27 B: and truthfully i thought they they had pretty decent planes

291.79 292.67 B: (( i )) 

291.80 296.76 A: (( 'cause especially when especially if you have the same viewpoint i know there's some people who think a lot of things have changed but )) 

298.06 299.10 A: (( i don't know )) 

298.29 305.37 B: well i don't let let's look at it a different way let's take a step further when they tell you it's orange instead of yellow 

305.24 307.43 A: yeah exactly i mean you don't you don't 

306.61 313.84 B: i don't care i mean don't get me wrong if i saw someone building a bomb i'd be the first one to y- you know

316.74 321.26 A: no i know this whole the whole the whole rating system is kind of absurd to me that they do that 

322.28 326.02 B: yeah i mean i think truthfully a number system would have been easier 

326.43 330.59 B: than a color system and stuff like that and [noise] i don't know 

330.67 333.61 B: but then again i don't buy in on the fact that uh 

333.83 341.89 B: you know the kids that are gonna do something they did it because they watched the matrix or some- something you know some cool movie and that's what did it to 'em 

341.05 343.61 A: yeah now that's that's a lot of crap too

455.86 466.02 A: i mean they should you know they have the same team they did las- i mean i don't know they're not gonna be great or anything like that like last year they had twelve wins and made the playoffs and then they just got killed by atlanta and they go killed at home too which is 

460.94 461.73 B: (( mhm )) 

464.20 469.04 B: yeah well we got we we killed ourselves with tampa bay

474.27 478.65 A: yeah see i think the packers can win enough games but i don't think when when the playoffs come that they're tough enough 

478.52 481.17 B: oh who's brett have has his weapon 

481.03 493.00 A: see they see last year they tried to get terry that didn't work out then like jivon walker was going to be second year they have bubble franks and the tight end and he's decent they don't have any like big name you know big guys that are out there 

493.18 495.08 A: they've got a bunch of middle guys 

494.85 499.05 B: the only thing i ever would say against farr because i always liked farr 

498.89 499.90 A: mhm 

499.27 507.53 B: you know 'cause you know he's a warrior that goes out the only thing i would ever say is that he doesn't seem to play good when he's like in a dome or something 

506.93 509.01 A: (( yeah he i know when he plays against when )) 

507.89 510.47 B: it's like a whole different like all of a sudden he's 

509.55 515.36 A: he plays in minnesota against every time they gets to minnesota they lose they're like two and eleven since he's been playing or something awful 

513.43 514.47 B: (( yeah and )) 

515.38 519.02 B: i never understood that 'cause you would think i would be easier in a dome 

518.52 521.09 A: i know i know he just relishes the cold weather i guess 

521.39 522.55 A: outside 

522.24 524.67 B: yeah it's yeah i don't 

523.89 533.55 A: and i don't i don't ever mind green they're pretty decent but i'm sure they not you know i'm sure they'll be like i think they'll be like ten and fifth something like that be like a wildcard team i don't know 

535.00 538.74 A: i just don't i have a tough time seeing them going far in the playoffs yeah 

537.91 539.42 B: have you been to lanbo 

539.30 552.25 A: yeah i've played i've been to cool games i was there for the uh inter city championship game it was like i think it was like ninety it was the year they won the super bowl like ninety seven i guess ninety six they played uh carolina panthers i saw also saw a thanksgiving game there against like dallas 

546.08 548.21 B: oh that's cool that'd be real 

553.72 557.15 A: a rare and that was a rare victory for the packers against the cowboys 

557.42 562.18 B: well see we're uh near philly everyone hates dallas 

561.61 565.64 A: yeah oh yeah i hated dallas 'cause dallas used to kill the packers every time 

564.87 570.51 B: yeah i mean so many years when dallas was so good and all they did was whip everyone and they got ever call 

570.31 572.41 A: (( yeah how do feel about the giants )) 

573.72 583.02 B: yeah i guess we should we hate i guess we should have more of a rivalry with the giants but truthfully even when they suck everybody loves when you kill dallas 

579.48 580.47 A: mhm 

582.92 584.74 A: yeah no that's very true 

584.27 591.40 B: i mean gi- giants are definitely much more of a threat than uh dallas but i still think we'll beat the giants again this year 

590.86 594.21 A: yeah gi- giants are just so they're so mediocre 

595.22 596.96 B: (( you know there's um )) 

597.26 599.89 B: well we'll see donovan gets a little better each year
