51.02 51.98 B: (( hm )) 

54.36 56.07 B: but uh 

54.91 55.64 A: [noise] 

56.12 58.06 B: i don't exercise 

58.07 65.96 B: at all i'm a farmer retired [noise] aircraft mechanic i get all my exercise on the farm and i'm not going to start a health program 

67.07 76.46 A: yeah me personally i'm looking into it 'cause i don't exercise enough but i am looking into g- um working out more i mean both me and my wife 

76.18 90.14 B: i i can see where you know if if you don't have the you know the physical [noise] stuff with your job or such as that where you could do it but one of the biggest turn offs is see these guys and gals on television with these 

90.40 97.99 B: bowflex or these great abs machines and everything it's downright sickening we weren't all su- all supposed to look like that 

98.19 109.97 A: i [noise] know i mean 'cause different people have different ways some people are meant to have be bigger with in health and some people are meant to be smaller and that's really what it is 'cause um 

103.96 104.69 B: mm 

110.15 116.02 A: me personally my wife she's really into exercising and getting more health and we're into fitness 

114.08 115.60 B: (( [noise] uh well ))

116.92 118.42 B: that's not 

118.66 119.33 A: [noise] 

119.03 126.89 B: i sometimes think just with a proper diet and everyday walking and everything uh is about all a person needs 

127.01 131.83 A: uh-huh well yeah you need the proper diet but you also at the same time need to um 

131.86 145.56 A: i mean working out gets with it too you got to drink right eat right drink like lots of water and with that and a lot of physical activity like exercising that's that's proper too it's very effective too 

145.36 149.51 B: well see i've always felt that exercising going out and doing 

149.52 153.17 B: pushups sit ups using the machines and everything 

153.17 164.97 B: was a waste of manpower energy because uh you could be doing something using the same amount of energy doing something physically wor- physical work and accomplish something with it 

165.10 167.55 A: well there's more ways to exercise 

167.85 172.46 A: like even with swimming like in the ocean like is a good w- 

171.01 179.41 B: [mn] oh yeah i understand that but what i'm saying to spend an hour in a gym rather than hour than an hour out mowing the grass or you know 

179.59 182.71 B: something like that i just don't believe in that 

182.57 187.99 A: yeah i know what you're saying some parts of me 'cause we have tried like i know with myself 

184.00 185.02 B: (( it's ama- )) 

188.46 190.26 A: um are you still there 

189.63 190.82 B: yeah 

190.40 198.53 A: uh okay yeah it's a cheap phone intel [laughter] anyways i know um i know with um [noise] 

193.99 194.92 B: [laughter] 

198.62 202.39 A: (( swimming a lot of the times 'cause the resistance it doesn't burn )) 

202.68 203.92 A: lose you don't lose 

204.85 209.05 A: gives you more um fitness gives you more muscle and stuff 

209.08 214.20 B: well i love to swim but i don't do it for exercise i just do it for relaxation 

214.07 218.20 A: yeah that's a good way to uh relax and exercise at the same 

217.05 229.02 B: right all in the same all at the same time but as far as a program get up in the morning walk so far do so many exercises and that or in the evening that that to me that's a turn off 

218.41 221.43 A: (( time )) 

228.79 233.65 A: yeah yeah i'm not i understand i remember like years ago when i was 

233.94 240.73 A: [noise] when i [noise] used to exercise daily it's uh it did work a lot and eventually i want to get back to that point but i mean 

239.27 240.51 B: well for some 

240.71 250.60 A: i remember i felt a lot better it's like by running around sweating and stuff like that just running down the street and stuff like down the block on a jog 

248.06 249.21 B: mhm 

250.62 257.50 B: but for some people that's a good thing like i say it just doesn't sui- it doesn't fit me doesn't fit me 

257.54 260.96 A: yeah i know what you're saying some people aren't [noise] 

261.58 273.69 A: yeah but there's like different exercises for different people like some people it's other things some people it's not some times it's could be like there's probably exercises where you could get healthy around the farm too 

261.72 262.57 B: but 

273.31 273.91 B: [cough] 

275.45 284.09 B: yeah i get out and unload a hundred fifty pound bags of seed or such as this i've done my exercise for the day 

283.80 285.48 A: i've exercised too 

285.70 294.40 A: you do i do notice myself though you do need cardio vascular like it doesn't have to be a gym but when you like do it 'cause your blood gets pumping more 

294.20 297.19 B: well i had a heart attack about four years ago 

297.22 298.50 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

297.36 300.27 B: and i i went through the rehab program 

299.64 302.10 A: mhm 

300.63 311.47 B: and they said well you can either stay with it or you can go on without out without uh doing a program as long as you do something two or three times a week that is s- 

311.55 317.60 B: well not stressful but strenuous to get you know so that y- that you raise your heart rate 

317.96 322.93 A: yeah i know what you're saying 'cause that's what happens 'cause your blood comes pumping again too 

319.40 320.32 B: so 

321.72 325.97 B: yep anything anything to raise your heart rate and such as this 

326.16 330.77 B: and everything and i says well anything i can do that i don't have to do repetitive 

330.63 332.60 A: yeah another goo- 

331.24 332.45 B: that that 

333.10 340.23 A: uh excuse me yeah huh another good thing i know is drinking a lot of water is real good for health too 

333.79 335.56 B: that's go ahead 

340.14 341.48 B: (( [noise] that )) 

340.35 341.89 A: 'cause it's like all 

341.61 342.88 B: that i do 

342.89 351.35 A: yeah that cleans your system and helps that way too 'cause i meant yeah flushes it out 

346.79 348.34 B: flushes it out 

350.40 354.20 B: and it's sort of odd i can remember back when i was in the military 

354.42 359.83 B: in the hot weather you took salt [noise] tablets for your health now they tell you not to 

360.02 364.59 A: (( yeah [laughter] a lot of things changed the thing with water it's pure )) 

363.12 364.00 B: (( well )) 

365.60 373.70 A: [cough] it's pure and everything i mean me i drink a lot of soda sometimes so i have to drink more water the average person for health 

373.77 382.20 A: should drink like eight eight cups of water a day but the thing is if you eat a lot of junk food or drink a lot of soda and sugars you have to drink more 

376.92 377.74 B: (( hm )) 

381.55 385.85 B: yeah i was gonna say the more sugar that's in it the more water you have to drink 

385.34 393.67 A: exactly well water flushes out your kidneys takes away all breaks down the fat that's helps a lot too 

393.68 394.83 B: but uh 

394.64 400.88 A: 'cause a lot of cokes also i've heard a lot of sodas and junk foods can give you diabetes 

399.56 407.73 B: yeah or or well i won't say i don't know about giving it it [noise] it ai- it helps it you know helps help it helps you to get it 

407.06 408.87 A: yeah that's sugar aid 

408.76 415.24 B: but uh other than that i'm not a health nut i i got my outside work and it keeps me busy 

415.27 426.84 B: and i started like i say it sort of it's a turn off to see these people that just do a strenuous workout to build this and to build that and everything and it just doesn't do nothing for me 

426.49 440.94 A: yeah i know what you're saying one thing i like it's um a whole other thing grapefruit they say that by eating a lot of fruits grapefruits good but you have to complete it with a eat a healthy diet to go with it that's another good way 

441.26 442.42 B: well that 

441.53 443.39 A: that should get 

442.45 456.72 B: i eat er i eat just what i want i'm you know i mean i don't i'm not saying diets not good but when i say eat what i want a balanced diet you know [lipsmack] i i eat everything but uh i don't just pick on one thing 

444.82 446.55 A: yeah 

452.02 454.19 A: [noise] yeah i understand 

456.38 466.69 A: yeah i also heard another thing that go people tell me about this from my church and um a lot of people go um like to the find out the blood [noise] type 

466.59 467.68 A: 'cause the blood type 

467.69 468.53 A: each blood type is 

468.53 471.02 A: different and some people need certain 

471.02 483.89 A: foods and stuff to stay healthy stay healthy and stuff in the blood type like some people with a certain type of blood type can't eat one food where it's unhealth- not healthy for them or another food too 

481.69 482.88 B: (( mhm mm )) 

484.16 486.46 A: i've heard that 

485.07 486.57 B: but uh 

486.73 499.81 B: i don't know i guess i'm too old to look at all these new things and everything and as i grew up we got our exercise working on the farm or working you know doing this and doing that and today half that stuff is gone 

499.89 501.86 A: yeah 

499.91 506.61 B: it's not you don't have the opportunity to do it so therefore well yeah you got to go to the gym or you got to go 

506.64 508.44 B: down the basement and 

508.76 512.59 B: use your use your machine whatever happens to be 

513.82 519.17 A: yeah i know what you're saying i mean i used to uh go to a gym and stuff but i just 'cause the 

519.14 520.39 A: thing with gyms don't take uh er 

520.36 532.51 A: have too much time so i try to make little things to get myself healthy and more fit like i walk a lot i drink a lot of water i try to do little things and have it work for me to make me healthier 

527.45 528.24 B: that 

532.03 533.32 B: i i 

532.47 537.48 A: like i cut down on a lot of soda a lot of sugar and everything 

537.73 540.46 B: well that's one thing they told me that uh 

540.62 544.24 B: when i was doing doing my rehab and everything they said 

544.09 557.88 B: now this is as long as this gets you to the point where it hurts a little bit so to speak or it's a challenge it's great when you get to the point [noise] that you can do it without raising your heart rate then we're gonna give you more 

557.79 561.20 A: yeah 

558.30 570.74 B: yeah i've seen [noise] that in everyday life in different you know different jobs so i thought well i don't need a health health program or you know what i'm saying a fitness exercise program 

570.50 580.44 A: (( [mn] yeah i know what you're saying i mean i guess there's different things for different people i mean just 'cause you do need people are overweight they don't want to do it )) 

575.08 576.00 B: yep 

581.17 582.30 B: hello 

582.12 584.00 A: (( [noise] hello i'm sorry ))
