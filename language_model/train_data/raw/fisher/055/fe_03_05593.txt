310.45 311.06 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

312.93 315.79 B: and we should do something about it

390.21 391.62 B: i think i think 

390.98 393.63 A: we shouldn't put our trust in the government then 

393.57 402.61 B: no i don't the government the government that don't trust their people is not a government it's a dictatorship 

402.14 403.97 A: mhm 

403.02 414.46 B: i mean here's the thing if if you're government fears you they're going to pass laws and do everything under in their power to restrict your movements to restrict your finance 

414.55 417.66 B: in a way to restrict your housing and your travel 

418.94 419.96 A: (( [noise] mhm ))

438.02 443.63 B: there's automatic weapons in every house that has a male over the age of eighteen and under the age of fifty five 

445.99 446.92 A: mhm 

446.26 450.19 B: they just they control their own destiny rather than their government 

451.72 457.29 A: yeah i see i that that is one of the most peaceful places i never hear anything about switzerland 

456.71 458.29 B: i loved it 

459.18 463.33 B: and i think that granted we have a whole different society 

463.43 468.07 B: but i think we could i think we could work to have more freedoms 

468.51 471.54 B: and prevent what happened from happening again 

471.72 474.66 B: by trusting our people rather than our government 

476.48 479.81 A: yes that's true i think we need to at least 

480.39 485.07 A: be more vocal and just people need to stop sitting around and just watching all the time 

483.34 486.57 B: stop sitting around and stand up and be part of it 

486.82 488.76 B: you won't agree with everybody 

488.82 491.70 B: you'll make a few enemies and you'll make a lot of friends 

492.38 499.09 B: but if something's done it helps the community helps the county helps the state helps the country you're part of it

501.94 503.54 A: yeah i agree with you on 

503.34 510.46 B: but that's i mean that's just my feelings about it i think the united states have got to be a nation of weenies 

507.85 508.73 A: (( that [mn] )) 

510.47 513.64 B: and they want the government to do for 'em 

514.68 515.87 A: (( mhm ))

525.99 529.15 B: and if you don't wanna do it then you don't eat 

531.79 535.72 B: i think we should close our borders and be very strict just like it was 

536.17 539.75 B: forty years ago and screen everybody that comes in 

541.27 544.11 A: [mn] yeah the the country has a lot of
