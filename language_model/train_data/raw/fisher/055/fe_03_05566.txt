14.55 17.93 B: all right so terrorist attacks on [noise] september eleventh 

18.13 19.19 B: um 

19.20 22.75 B: haven't really changed my life much um 

23.36 31.89 B: the first uh couple of months after i was taking some trips and cancelled [noise] the flights but other than that uh i haven't really done much 

32.26 33.97 A: yeah i would agree i'd say 

34.53 38.52 A: after [sigh] after it all happened that was probably 

39.23 44.07 A: the time when it changed the most and i i mean i do you go do you live in new york 

43.65 45.20 B: no i live in chicago 

44.86 49.26 A: oh see i live in the city so it was a little more emotional up here 

49.09 50.22 B: (( oh yeah )) 

49.68 50.95 A: and uh 

51.33 53.95 A: i definitely cancelled some plans i had to 

53.97 61.94 A: think about going down going out to israel on this free trip that i had and i cancelled that because just hesitant about anything 

61.78 62.55 B: uh-huh 

62.18 72.21 A: but other than that you know after the initial shock i'd say about couple of months went by don't think it really changed anything i don't have a family though 

68.32 69.10 B: yeah 

70.30 71.29 B: (( mhm )) 

72.58 73.49 B: (( oh really )) 

72.80 73.62 A: so 

73.63 77.57 A: it might have more of affect on people who have children and you know 

77.55 81.15 B: yeah i understand that um [lipsmack] 

81.73 86.55 B: yeah i was actually in new york i- in the trade center two months before 

86.85 91.23 B: and uh that was my first time in new york and i went back 

91.31 97.88 B: uh two weeks ago and had that was my second time there so it was definitely different um 

98.66 101.92 B: (( [lipsmack] i don't know i yeah like i said uh )) 

102.14 115.18 B: didn't temporarily or cancelled one trip after the after the fact i haven't i actually cancelled a trip this previous spring because of the war but uh nothing really to do with the terrorist attacks um 

116.70 119.87 B: [lipsmack] i don't know i guess my life's been pretty normal ever since then [noise] 

121.66 123.75 A: yeah i think 

123.84 128.91 A: one of the things i mean i definitely don't go down to 

129.24 133.21 A: the downtown area nearly as much as i used to [noise] 

132.92 133.88 B: oh really 

133.32 135.62 A: after september eleventh i uh 

134.90 135.81 B: uh-huh 

136.16 139.61 A: stay more in midtown and lower east side 

140.46 150.15 A: and you know i i wouldn't you know everybody was saying after it happened [noise] that broad- it was going to be the end of broadway if you want to see a broadway show see it now 

150.08 150.88 B: yeah 

150.26 155.85 A: and it seemed like the city just kind of picked itself back up and even the country i mean i know people coming in 

156.21 163.89 A: that i visited that came in to visit me actually after the whole thing happened and you know they thought of it as a 

164.07 167.15 A: as a monument site something they they had to see 

166.94 168.59 B: (( uh-huh the )) 

168.55 169.33 A: um 

168.79 169.90 B: ground zero 

171.50 173.19 B: you're talking about the ground zero 

173.27 174.61 A: yeah ground zero 

174.41 182.98 B: yeah uh yeah i haven't seen that yet but obviously i've seen some of the photos and whatnot on t._v. um 

183.62 195.46 B: i guess i'd be interested in going to see it i don't know i mean i'm i'm pretty sure i have a good idea what it's what it's all about it's pretty sad but i don't know i guess it's uh [lipsmack] 

195.94 205.78 B: yeah i i remember a lot of people around chicago were trying to stay away from the sears tower area for a good amount of time after that happened um [lipsmack] 

205.80 208.43 B: i can definitely see why some people 

208.51 211.37 B: i know quit their jobs there [noise] 

210.41 211.81 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

211.40 213.73 B: 'cause they were scared um 

215.26 221.09 B: i don't know but i guess what has it been it's going to be two years this this september yeah [lipsmack] 

220.04 221.14 A: (( yeah it )) 

222.51 224.22 B: it's pretty weird uh 

223.36 227.10 A: made flying suck [laughter] my grandmother had to 

227.48 229.94 A: take her shoes off and it you know 

229.34 230.88 B: (( yeah )) 

231.35 233.98 A: definitely has made flying much more of a hassle 

234.07 244.15 B: yeah and yeah the obviously people uh most directly by that are probably the or obviously would be the families that lost someone but also the uh 

244.62 247.46 B: airline industry and their jobs and um 

248.01 255.19 B: [noise] it's a shame that so many people lost their jobs because of that but i guess that happens in this type of world these days 

254.91 259.97 A: [noise] yeah it's pretty much i i mean i don't know if it was so much just the attacks or 

260.00 262.81 A: that's just the way it was going to go anyway as you know what i mean 

262.50 268.33 B: [noise] yeah i think uh uh yeah i think it was going towards that way but this just intensified the uh 

268.91 271.44 B: repressed economy i don't know 

270.16 271.05 A: yeah 

271.13 273.72 A: and the economy was shit before that 

273.16 279.10 B: [noise] yeah you got that right it's not doing so well these days either hopefully it'll pick up in the fall 

276.74 277.61 A: no 

279.14 282.32 A: the old seven second half recovery [laughter] 

281.66 283.60 B: [laughter] i hope so 

282.76 285.28 A: i was speaking to this japanese guy 

285.30 290.21 A: and he's like yeah it took us about two and a half years to realize there was no second half recovery 

290.18 292.00 B: yeah 

291.47 293.30 A: kinda funny 

292.97 298.24 B: yeah well i don't know i hope that i hope that works out in our favor [noise] 

297.64 301.21 A: did you guys ever think when it was happening that 

301.41 303.44 A: chicago might be next 

302.98 305.69 B: yeah definitely they were uh 

306.35 312.69 B: i remember i was in school that day and uh obviously they cancelled school and no one was supposed to go 

313.12 317.02 B: home i mean no one was supposed to go anywhere other than home because uh 

317.26 321.58 B: they had i don't know i guess there were rumors that the sears tower was next 

321.59 323.01 B: so um 

323.43 325.18 B: it was pretty scary [noise] 

325.26 329.44 B: and i live right on the outskirts of to- or i may- i maybe live uh 

329.69 332.97 B: about five miles from downtown chicago so 

333.64 344.27 B: yeah it was it was fairly scary just because we just you know been shocked with this news and people were telling us that we were next so i don't know 

343.18 345.04 A: yeah that had to be pretty crazy 

344.90 346.84 B: yeah it was not fun 

346.64 347.64 A: 'cause i know 

347.84 349.32 A: i work out of midtown 

349.49 355.28 A: and when that first one hit [noise] you know i'll tell you the craziest part about the whole thing was when after 

349.72 350.72 B: oh yeah 

355.29 357.71 A: we finally evacuated our buildings 

357.84 362.29 A: you know we have c._n._b._c. playing a- all the time in our office 

362.01 363.32 B: yeah 

362.79 365.52 A: and so we knew exactly what had happened 

365.23 365.95 B: uh-huh 

365.71 370.57 A: half the people out on the streets had no idea why they were even out of their building they 

370.73 371.62 B: right 

371.09 373.36 A: were just bullshitting like it was just another day 

373.32 374.07 B: uh-huh 

374.19 376.21 A: (( crazy i )) 

375.44 376.72 B: yeah 

376.56 378.89 A: guess we're off topic do you think that's okay 

378.76 380.57 B: (( [laughter] i think that's fine )) 

379.43 381.70 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

381.41 382.69 B: (( um )) 

382.74 386.87 B: (( let's see are they going to do you they're going to beep in when it's over or something )) 

386.50 390.95 A: yeah i think it just pretty much cuts out i've been watching a clock it's been about six minutes 

391.14 392.57 B: oh really okay 

391.69 396.33 A: yeah isn't that unbelievable [laughter] [laughter] 

393.16 394.61 B: [laughter] 

395.33 402.94 B: [laughter] um all right then let's uh see if we can get one more aspect of this situation uh [lipsmack] 

405.14 406.54 B: (( [mn] okay )) 

406.54 407.43 A: so 

407.00 407.65 B: (( in )) 

408.02 411.48 A: i don't think i'd want to travel to new york if i lived outside of it though 

412.21 413.74 B: yeah uh 

412.94 416.45 A: or work i mean they're rebuilding the whole thing [mn] too 

416.51 422.06 A: which i don't know if you guys have spotted the plans for that as nearly as much as we have here in the city 

416.72 417.43 B: yeah 

421.53 423.34 B: no i haven't really that much 

422.89 427.09 A: but wouldn't i don't know i would just think that it'd be weird working down there 

427.13 428.04 B: (( working )) 

427.20 429.40 A: after all that though 

428.62 431.91 B: in the fi- you mean like in the financial districts and that kind of thing 

431.14 435.09 A: no like after they rebuild the buildings just going down there 

433.28 436.92 B: (( oh you mean working in the building oh yeah definitely yeah i )) 

437.48 440.21 B: yeah i would not want to work in the uh 

440.44 446.00 B: in any of those two buildings at least for ten to fifteen years i'd say 

446.29 448.16 B: to give it some type of uh 

448.95 453.07 B: i don't know i that would just crazy if something like that happened again after they rebuilt it i 

453.13 454.01 A: yeah 

453.34 455.28 B: can't im- i can't imagine 

454.87 458.22 A: i wonder if they're just sitting there waiting for us to build it back up 

457.90 460.86 B: yeah that would [noise] oh man that would 

460.47 462.52 A: that's just fucked 

461.93 464.71 B: that would be horrible [noise] um 

465.82 467.53 B: no i uh 

467.88 473.62 B: i would travel to new york i like i said i i drove out there i didn't fly but it wasn't 'cause of 

474.07 476.01 B: fear it was just i don't know 

476.78 480.22 B: [mn] uh i wanted to take a road trip out there and um 

481.87 483.48 B: (( i don't know i i definitely )) 

483.59 490.00 B: don't have any reservations about uh not flying there anymore or flying anywhere else in the world from now on 

490.24 493.70 B: um i think people took it [noise] a little too seriously 

494.44 499.13 B: uh the flight the flight deal that is not the terrorists 

497.30 498.75 A: mhm 

499.57 500.62 B: um 

501.10 503.35 B: but yeah i would [sigh] 

503.40 506.71 B: i would definitely fly out to new york again if i needed to 

507.47 509.44 B: reservations about that 

508.85 510.83 A: yeah 

510.79 524.15 A: i just thought it was funny how the airlines handled it all you know like [sigh] immediately thereafter they started searching everybody and looking at everybody and you know and then like the foot guy came on remember that guy that kinda had a little bomb in his foot 

523.53 525.66 B: oh that's right yeah yeah yeah 

524.98 529.75 A: and all of a sudden everybody has to take off their shoes it's like we're always one step behind on this thing 

529.27 530.77 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

530.91 537.66 B: yeah there's no po- i mean they're obviously not going to do the shoe thing again so once the entire airline industry starts s- searching shoes 

537.81 542.29 B: they'll just figure something else out to do and then we'll start doing that 

542.67 543.71 B: (( i don't know )) 

544.71 548.14 B: um what are we on nine minutes now [laughter] 

548.07 550.39 A: (( um let me see )) 

551.37 553.67 A: yeah just about 

553.32 555.25 B: (( right um )) 

555.43 559.01 B: all right one more minute on september eleventh let's see um 

561.31 562.16 B: (( uh [noise] )) 

563.32 571.09 A: uh september eleventh oh all in all we could sum it up i think if i had if you had to ask me how long 

571.36 573.89 A: it took me for my life to get back to normal 

573.89 574.73 B: yeah 

574.01 585.39 A: looking back on it afterwards back to the way it was before then i'd say it probably took with the start of the new year i think that was kind of a symbolic mark for a lot of people 

582.07 582.99 B: yeah 

584.42 586.58 B: yeah exactly yeah 

586.28 589.91 A: as well it kinda like put that behind us put it away put 

589.94 599.90 A: all of last year you know it was a shitty year financially and social sociologically and put it away and kinda move on and i think that i don't i would say looking
