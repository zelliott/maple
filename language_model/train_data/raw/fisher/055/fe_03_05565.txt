18.78 20.59 A: (( um ha )) 

18.95 20.65 B: (( oh yeah that's )) 

20.72 24.22 A: yeah i i i do i don't even know where to begin [laughter] 

21.44 22.81 B: [sigh] has there been any 

23.65 27.63 B: uh has there been uh any discrimination against you or anything of the sort 

26.96 28.19 A: (( uh )) 

28.50 34.89 A: [sigh] a bit i it's it's it's more subtle than for most people mostly when i go to the airport and to travel 

35.03 37.60 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

35.22 36.45 A: and so 

37.01 41.63 A: but i i i live in the metro area so if anything it's [noise] 

40.94 55.56 B: yeah well i also live in the metro area so it's quite it's quite uh dangerous especially the first few weeks i was kinda worried about you know what if something like that was going to happen somewhere here 'cause i'm from philadelphia and it's a pretty big city 

52.07 53.15 A: right 

54.97 56.73 A: i see i see 

56.75 60.31 A: yeah i live right outside new york and so it 

58.75 59.61 B: yeah 

60.38 64.54 A: is very tragic and yeah it wa- it was scary the first few days 

64.70 67.82 A: but by now i mean things have toned down 

67.18 69.65 B: [noise] yeah well i hope it stays this way [noise] 

69.47 71.84 A: yeah yeah same here 

70.16 71.17 B: (( make this )) 

71.93 73.84 A: (( it was a very scary day )) 

74.21 79.34 B: yeah that was probably one of the darkest days in american history and times 

74.24 75.03 A: and 

80.36 82.11 A: (( yeah it )) 

80.39 94.41 B: in the last in the last few decades definitely because i don't think that there has been anything of this sort since mm perhaps pearl harbor attack but that was not even a civilian place that was a military base that was attacked so 

93.96 98.07 A: was right i mean here civilians were specifically targeted and 

98.81 102.79 A: certainly left i think an indelible mark on everybody you know 

102.21 116.75 B: oh absolutely and it's something that's uh yeah it's uh definitely changed everybody's lives and nobody's ever going to be the same i think again especially those people who witnessed it and uh it was a shame because uh [noise] 

104.00 104.81 A: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

116.77 130.97 B: i know people who were just crying because uh for example one woman was crying because she was pregnant that time and she didn't know how to bring the child into this world with all of this huma- inhumanity and uh [noise] 

131.28 132.50 A: wow 

131.94 142.00 B: anger yes so it was quite quite sad of course but [sigh] other than that [noise] so did you go and buy any of those masks during the anthrax time 

141.43 144.42 A: uh no no i didn't um uh-huh 

143.29 145.38 B: (( yeah neither did i but uh it )) 

145.40 148.30 B: was definitely quite a worry because 

148.93 150.71 B: [noise] especially here we 

149.31 154.20 A: yeah and and and now the just the way in which we live in constant fear 

150.85 151.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

153.66 154.70 B: (( mm [noise] [noise] )) 

154.30 162.14 A: i mean we are y- you read the n- front page of the paper and it'll tell you what homeland what the homeland security part or what alert we're on 

162.01 163.61 B: yeah yeah definitely [noise] 

162.40 166.18 A: and i mean wha- what does it mean that we're constantly on orange so you just 

166.21 167.13 B: yeah 

166.22 169.20 A: you know constantly be alert or be alert for what 

169.34 170.49 A: so i- it's 

169.45 178.68 B: [noise] no so it's basically all that system i think is kind of useless because it's tell you tells you how much to worry but in the end it tells you to not worry really so 

178.40 180.42 A: right right i- it's like 

178.81 183.46 B: [sigh] so i think that's [noise] you know that's kind of weird but [noise] 

182.77 189.71 A: and just just constantly sounding the alarm and then e- even then wha- what can you do i mean 

188.64 197.45 B: [noise] absolutely nothing i mean you still have to go [sigh] and uh do whatever you were supposed to do because otherwise they have won those terrorists and that's 

194.16 194.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

197.75 199.30 B: definitely quite [noise] 

198.62 211.85 A: right i mean they they we should go on lea- leading on our lives as usual i mean the changes i've made in my life have been ve- they're very very subtle for example when i travel um i take special care to shave now and uh 

200.35 201.58 B: yeah we have to 

202.84 203.72 B: absolutely 

204.54 205.18 B: [noise] 

211.60 213.15 B: mm [sigh] yeah 

212.25 222.90 A: and and make sure al- i always look clean cut and you'd be surprised how much it helps and before i could shlep on to an airport and and just go looking like a total bum 

214.06 214.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

222.87 235.28 A: but now it [mn] i've seen i've noticed a difference if i wear a collared shirt and i'm clean shaven they will still pull me to the side but but they won't be you know a- the same as the first time i travelled after nine eleven 

230.58 231.61 B: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

232.61 233.29 B: yeah 

233.66 240.67 B: yeah well actually actually i uh i'm actually of a pretty dark complexion myself so i i have to shave 

238.97 241.68 A: i see so so you know what i'm talking about 

241.10 242.40 B: absolutely 

242.14 244.62 A: yeah a- and would you know 

243.47 249.29 B: yeah i would always shave before an airport [laughter] not oh oh yeah especially after september eleventh 

248.98 258.30 A: it'd be the little things and even then you know i i think of it this way if they weren't you know pulling people like me and you to the side then are they doing their job i don't know 

249.35 250.09 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

258.32 261.38 A: i'm i'm not sure what what to do about this profiling thing 

258.58 259.35 B: well 

259.80 263.78 B: i'd i'd rather them check me than uh anything like that happen again 

263.36 273.26 A: exactly exactly you know i i i i don't find it inconvenient if they do pull me to the side because you know they're they're doing their job and i'd rather have them doing their job 

264.60 265.88 B: so 

269.64 270.88 B: (( i yeah )) 

272.19 279.99 B: yeah but i i i think that they should probably you know check oh other oh other people as well and not necessarily of that complexion 

278.96 289.23 A: oh no no i'm not implying i i i haven't seen profiling i've seen grandmothers stopped as well which i you know other people they they laugh and they complain but i say to them why not 

284.04 285.06 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

288.48 293.22 B: [noise] yeah well i i totally agree because we need that type of stuff and [noise] 

291.97 297.80 A: because if you stop i mean lo- look at the the you know the recent incidents richard reid wasn't 

297.86 304.84 B: oh yeah richard reid yeah that was quite an incident too have you se- have you stopped for a while flying in planes 

304.41 307.38 A: oh no no i i i carry on i n- 

307.39 310.60 A: and i never found it to be in- 

311.22 312.58 A: (( uh uh i i )) 

312.80 317.07 A: statistically i i know in my mind it's safer than driving so 

316.86 318.23 B: yeah definitely 

317.35 319.27 A: i haven't stopped flying 

319.13 321.17 B: yeah that makes sense well yes yeah 

320.48 326.02 A: and if anything uh you know security has been beefed up so [lipsmack] 

326.63 327.55 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

326.93 338.95 A: al- although uh most recently i i went to hong kong and i unfortunately this uh i went there right as sars uh the week before sars peaked is when i got there there was a 

338.68 339.65 B: (( oh )) 

338.97 352.96 A: people weren't wearing face masks and i watched b._b._c. while i was there and i sa- they showed the news report with all these people running around wearing face masks and i said wait a minute i'm here on the ground and this isn't happening and within the week i had to purchase several face masks 

346.36 347.00 B: (( mm )) 

353.33 355.71 A: (( so that was that was somewhat unfortunate )) 

355.28 356.94 B: (( yeah yeah so [noise] )) 

355.94 366.16 A: but but i mean who you know who can predict a thing like sars or sele- september eleventh or now monkey pox so but but yeah i think the world has definitely changed 

359.99 362.40 B: (( no nobody could nobody could )) 

362.78 363.83 B: definitely 

366.51 371.55 B: yeah well the the world is definite- definitely more alert right now and it's stuff like that 

370.22 371.63 A: (( r- right )) 

371.91 378.28 B: which i think uh well i don't know uh it's it was very sad on that day of course but [sigh] 

376.91 379.95 A: (( [noise] ye- yeah i- i- it was )) 

379.78 385.64 B: yeah i'm thanking god that they didn't use any nuclear weapons or anything because tha- that would've been terrible 

380.26 381.06 A: (( and )) 

383.25 385.89 A: oh yeah a- absolutely 

386.23 392.40 A: although now i mean the media you know raised my concern for things like dirty bombs i mean 

392.22 393.79 B: yeah definitely 

392.75 400.09 A: wha- wha- what does that entail i mean w- what exactly happens in a dirty bomb and how can you prevent something like that i'm not sure 

399.45 408.17 B: i don't think you can actually prevent anything of the sort and it's it's quite it's quite uh sad and it's quite scary really so i guess the 

408.16 416.15 B: and the most we can do is just not think about it regularly because otherwise it's just yeah uh i i don't think we can 

416.49 417.80 B: uh live 

416.72 423.31 A: [noise] right i mean i i do- i don't i hope people don't become paranoid and live their lives in fear 

417.98 419.21 B: (( yeah yeah that's the )) 

424.19 428.79 A: but i'm i'm not sure how uh the war in iraq plays into this as well i mean 

424.97 426.11 B: last thing 

429.47 434.20 A: is is is this going to increase the number of attacks decrease i i don't know 

433.81 444.02 B: [noise] [noise] well in this nation we haven't really had anything after that uh we did have attempts such as you said for example by ri- uh what's his name reid and uh 

444.74 445.95 B: [sigh] yeah but o- 

444.81 447.04 A: right that trucker recently 

446.78 448.23 B: yeah 

447.32 450.34 A: they they found that trucker in the midwest 

450.72 452.40 A: but 

452.45 453.70 A: i i don't know 

453.13 455.17 B: (( o- other than that no mm mm )) 

455.28 460.76 A: well i which uh you know i mean that's probably good that they stopped both these people before they carried anything out 

460.21 460.82 B: [noise] 

460.97 467.87 B: [noise] yeah and uh obviously and the there's the war war in iraq that which definitely now was a 

468.46 471.29 B: a side effect i would say of this 

471.54 474.33 B: uh oh e- event so 

473.01 474.00 A: right 

474.81 480.06 A: yeah i i su- supposedly the war is slowing down now but i'm not sure i still hear 

475.86 476.70 B: so 

478.80 493.32 B: oh yeah it is it is slowing down but uh it's still uh it's we're still in that state of war and uh there are people killed every day and now that uh the president has declared the open war on militants 

480.20 481.89 A: uh a few deaths every day 

487.68 488.87 A: right right 

493.35 507.84 B: [noise] all of whom actually support terror and now it doesn't really matter where whether whether it be in the states or in israel or in russia or anywhere else i think it's i think uh we have to fight with them no matter what the costs are 

497.81 498.96 A: exactly 

507.59 508.53 A: right 

508.58 514.42 A: i i just don't want it to turn into some sort of orwellian scenario where we're just constantly at war with somebody 

509.23 509.97 B: [noise] 

510.00 510.72 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

513.50 515.89 B: yeah yeah definitely that's true 

515.29 522.86 A: and we're just looking always looking for the next enemy i mean if it's not part of the axis of evil then where i mean indonesia and there 

522.73 532.75 A: there's terrorists everywhere i suppose you know and wha- as long as you're on the hunt for these cells who who know this this could go on indefinitely a- a- 

531.55 539.62 B: [noise] yeah [noise] oh i i think unfortunately it is actually going to go on for a very very long time and yeah 

536.48 537.60 A: wow 

539.01 541.30 A: becau- and because the uh i 

540.55 541.24 B: [noise] 

541.62 546.40 A: guess the aftermath of pearl harbor world war two was completed in what forty seven 

546.43 547.62 A: so it 

546.58 558.24 B: yeah yeah [noise] but uh world war two was an overt uh thing because uh everybody knew who attacked whom and here there are people hiding in caves and you don't know how many caves to search and when to stop 

553.96 554.95 A: right 

557.21 563.51 A: right tha- that's true there's it's a big difference although i don't know what uh or the policy the president should 

563.61 578.23 A: pursue i mean w- aside from these preemptive strikes this isn't this isn't communism we're dealing with you know where you know the enemy like you said and you can't have a you know the reagan policy of containment where okay we'll we'll just leave communism within its borders or let it 

577.69 578.53 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

578.49 584.79 A: e- expand within within this elastic sphere that doesn't work if we don't know where the enemy is or who they are 

583.71 585.38 B: yeah exactly 

585.91 587.22 A: (( so i mean )) 

585.96 588.07 B: (( exactly which is quite unfortunate )) 

587.26 594.36 A: i i suppose that on his uh his preemptive strikes although there's been a lot of dissent may- maybe it's for the best 

594.42 599.86 A: who know maybe he's making more enemies i i really can't tell although i as far as i know 

597.22 598.59 B: (( yeah well [noise] ))
