55.62 57.58 A: ho- ho- ho how about you 

57.95 66.65 B: well i i i first i try to i understand w- why nine eleven happened ah i- in my opinion this was one of the greatest ah 

67.11 69.15 A: oh it was the biggest devasta- yeah 

67.32 76.59 B: um changes in the in american history um and the one of the facts o- of it is ah that i believe that ah the government may have been involved in it ah 

76.40 77.87 A: our government 

76.43 83.45 B: or elements of the government yeah i i believe that ah that they may have wanted this to happen ah 

79.13 79.79 A: (( okay )) 

83.54 93.95 B: ah so they could um s- have a reason to um um you know go into ah afghanistan and look for the the supposed perpetrator of it w- who was ah bin laden 

93.81 94.77 A: yeah 

94.04 94.86 B: (( ah )) 

95.30 105.77 B: and ah then when bin laden was ah supposedly to be um m- turned over by the pakistani authorities if you recall george bush said um 

105.64 111.16 B: well we don't want any conditions we just want ah him turned over and they didn't turn him over 

109.18 110.10 A: yeah 

111.18 119.42 B: um and he got back um in hiding i suppose in his cave somewhere but um then they started um you know um 

111.21 112.08 A: (( mm )) 

119.33 129.28 B: the war in afghanistan and ah one of the reasons for this war is to um put a pipeline through there ah from the to get oil from um 

125.98 126.87 A: yeah 

129.44 135.53 B: the um kazakhstan and the b- the caspian sea area there where there seems to be quite a bit 

134.01 135.20 A: so you are 

135.28 140.88 A: i i don't mean to interrupt but you're obviously a lot wiser than i am and um not being 

139.17 142.68 B: uh-huh so this is almost too much for you [laughter] 

141.64 149.12 A: yeah it it but i mean i really understand what you're saying but you're you're you you are you're wiser you and you see more to it but i mean 

148.97 151.09 B: well i've lived i've lived all over the world 

149.02 160.56 A: i don't think we're g- i don't i i don't think we're gonna kill people just [laughter] to get some oil [laughter] i mean that's how the persian gulf war started i know that and you know that right 

154.73 156.09 B: mhm 

159.95 173.89 B: well ah for example well a lotta people think that since um iraq has five hundred years' of oil for their people and america only has twenty years' estimated of oil for our people 

160.58 163.00 A: it was all over oil right 

173.44 174.34 A: yeah 

173.67 180.98 B: and we use a lot more and um i mean we there're still people driving on camels in iraq 

180.78 181.94 A: (( mhm )) 

181.35 182.27 B: uh 

182.30 192.31 B: the point of the matter is that um i- is there's a good possibility we went in there to get that oil to makes it to secure it for the american people ah there were also 

190.68 191.24 A: (( [mn] )) 

192.30 204.72 B: a- a- for example ah the iraqi people ah had signed contracts with the french and european um oil companies to drill for the oil that they have there they were exporting some but not um 

205.04 208.36 B: not a great amount there was a lot more to be exported ah 

208.64 213.83 B: now guess what ah most of the contracts are probably going to go american oil companies 

213.63 214.63 A: (( exa- [mn] )) 

214.03 216.78 B: ah those will be torn up 

215.68 218.79 A: yep but um 

216.97 221.55 B: so that'll so- that'll um well i mean i guess in one way it's important 

219.59 223.21 A: do you think we were so devastated when they started burning 'em [laughter] 

224.16 229.85 B: did they start burning these oil wells well they they constantly we haven't exported a drop since um 

229.99 243.00 B: we went in there because they have been able to ah sabotage the u- um the oil ah piping and so ah we've been busy trying to repair it and so far we haven't got one drop out of the country 

236.66 237.64 A: mhm 

242.14 246.88 A: so oh well i don't know i had cousin that was in the gulf war 

246.90 254.78 A: and he got shot and i g- i insist that he's the only person on our shot side that got shot [laughter] in that war you know

333.99 347.61 B: um be a man of leisure and therefore look into a lot of things where people who are just struggling to um make ends meet to get food on the table and a roof over their head they don't have time to look into all these things 

334.83 335.80 A: and 

347.25 348.23 A: yeah 

347.65 348.76 B: (( and ah )) 

348.81 356.11 B: [lipsmack] so we find out that ah the day that um nine eleven happened that george bush senior was in the white house 

356.33 362.13 B: and um ah junior was down in ah florida at a c- um first grade 

356.49 357.29 A: yeah 

362.34 363.40 B: class 

363.10 365.00 A: yeah reading 'em a story or something 

363.72 371.02 B: and he's informed and ah one hour after the first crash he's still talking to the first graders 

370.71 371.69 A: yeah 

371.11 385.00 B: now that doesn't sounds like a commander in chief it seems like the commander of the united states ought to be ah in a um secured area ah and ah he ought to be taking ah commands instead of going on 

383.32 387.18 A: well it sounds like he was obviously taken off guard too 

387.07 390.76 B: well taken off guard ah we were all taken off guard but 

387.79 392.81 A: if you think about it if if but you're assuming that he knew it happened i that's a 

392.05 403.69 B: well yeah they came and told him one hour after it happened what happened and he was still preaching one hour after i i i don't know if it was one hour after it was may may have been twenty or thirty minutes after 

395.36 396.21 A: yeah 

396.93 397.87 A: and 

401.89 405.14 A: i'm just saying he wanted to get his ah mess- is it 

404.21 417.63 B: but anyway he he didn't go into a a commander position and we always wondered about that and then his his father ah left the white house and ah went to a motel up in um wisconsin 

408.89 409.80 A: yeah 

416.39 419.07 A: (( camp david i don't know [laughter] )) 

418.69 421.02 B: (( but ah what have ah )) 

421.31 427.48 B: how has your life changed y- are you more cautious when you go to an airport ah do you fly any

427.73 429.72 B: hasn't it affected your life 

431.79 433.61 B: mhm 

431.95 433.12 A: so um 

432.88 447.27 A: as far as flying concerns i r- it really hasn't changed my life at all it it's affected me as far as m- my spirit and my heart you know i feel bad for these people that lost their families i can't imagine the devastation it caused 

438.43 439.39 B: yeah 

442.42 443.42 B: yeah 

447.20 448.74 A: these families you know 

448.83 451.20 A: and that's who i feel for you know 

451.64 454.63 A: i don't get into the you know the 

454.20 458.24 B: well there's a lot of politics involved they claim there was a lot of um 

455.94 468.45 A: exactly that's what i'm not that's what i don't get involved in i the politics i leave it up to the politicians [laughter] ah you know the sympathy all i can do is pray for these people that lost family members and are suffering w- 

459.46 460.50 B: mhm 

467.21 470.07 B: well your your friends and relatives um 

470.21 476.97 B: a- are they being more cautious where they go ah do they ah look when they see a suspicious package um 

475.82 487.32 A: m- i would my sister is was like she was thinking that she would see a white powder from donut she thought it was a- cyanide or whatever you want you know 

486.59 488.34 B: yeah 

487.20 493.32 A: she was things like that but i mean it really wasn't w- nobody went overboard nobody really 

493.92 496.71 A: you know took into 

496.89 503.02 A: took into consideration that there could be a guy walking down the street with a bomb but not i mean it wasn't that n- 

503.30 505.25 A: much of a worry for anybody 

503.41 509.25 B: but still i mean it sounds to me like in the back in your mind and of the family and friends they are more cautious 

509.20 521.94 A: well um in a way i'd i would say you think about it but i mean i i wasn't worried about starting up my car you know [laughter] i really don't know how to put it but i mean i 

518.58 519.36 B: mhm 

521.96 532.41 A: it really didn't change me and how about you i mean what did you do different i mean if you were traveling so much you you obviously had to spend so much more time in an airport 

524.51 525.73 B: yeah 

530.08 531.92 B: well i 

532.00 542.31 B: right i i i try to avoid the ah the main airports and go to the smaller airports where it's ah not so much um the the security checks and you feel a little um 

542.34 543.68 A: more secure 

542.61 545.87 B: less well a- anxious 

545.85 547.51 A: yeah 

546.48 549.98 B: um i don't fly as much anymore 

550.37 554.00 A: yeah ah just because of that that changed your 

550.39 553.03 B: um that's how my life will change 

553.22 556.93 B: i just think it's too much of a hassle there's so much worry about 

555.86 557.87 A: oh exactly yeah 

557.13 571.70 B: if you've got a pocket knife in your pocket or you know you know if you if you're carrying something that could they become very ah you know ah want- wanting to question you as to why you're carrying this or that and and ah you know you you you
