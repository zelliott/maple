0.08 1.53 A: hello 

0.90 4.07 B: hello hi this this is charles 

2.01 2.89 A: (( this )) 

3.82 6.37 A: uh this is daniel 

4.94 6.59 B: hi daniel 

6.64 8.88 B: (( do you do you do exercise )) 

7.01 7.57 A: (( [mn] )) 

8.66 20.52 A: uh yes actually i recently just started up again i i i was in a gym for about a year about a year and a half ago and then i i fell out of it for whatever reasons and you know 

18.01 19.21 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

20.53 26.01 A: i i actually got i just got bored of it frankly and uh how about how about yourself 

22.70 23.93 B: [laughter] 

25.62 37.05 B: yes i exercise uh quite regularly um a few years ago i had started a uh with my wife we did go to a fitness center here that's run by the city 

36.59 38.41 A: mhm 

36.92 47.98 B: but i get bored uh doing things on the inside i didn't like being inside so i now uh ride my bicycle regularly every day 

47.98 48.67 A: (( mm )) 

48.25 51.13 B: and i put in um [noise] uh 

51.34 59.05 B: [mn] an hour some days more some days less but usually i try to get in about approximately one hour every day 

58.92 60.50 A: uh w- where do you live 

60.11 64.40 B: i live in new jersey in a place called ocean city 

63.80 71.24 A: oh that's that's a nice place to bike i i i live in new york city so it's not not quite the same [laughter] 

68.02 69.53 B: oh okay 

69.91 75.29 B: yes [laughter] yes and a little harder to bike uh in the city i guess 

75.17 76.84 A: (( yeah )) 

75.56 81.08 B: but i'm fortunate because uh we have a very nice boardwalk in ocean city 

80.98 95.06 B: so i go from where i live over to the boardwalk it's about a a mile and then the boardwalk itself is two and a half miles long um so i get [mn] a nice smooth ride in 

95.02 102.16 B: um and then if i do the whole island back and forth uh i can get about seventeen miles of biking in 

102.46 104.06 A: (( mhm oh that's fantastic )) 

104.02 105.53 B: so it's a 

104.52 105.30 A: uh 

105.38 111.43 A: i'm i'm a rank amateur in comparison i mean i i i joined the gym again recently because my job 

111.72 120.07 A: my job makes me work nights nowadays and it's very it's very very sedentary so i was just feeling very uh sluggish 

114.50 115.65 B: (( [mn] uh-oh [mn] )) 

120.29 125.71 A: and so i decided i had to get back into some sort of exercise routine otherwise i would i would probably you know 

126.10 138.60 A: h- hate myself in one form or another you know ph- physically and so now i just do do the treadmill a lot and like i go on the machines every so often or i mean i do the treadmill every day and then i 

132.57 133.95 B: mhm 

137.65 139.04 B: every [mn] 

138.51 141.49 A: then i use the machines like every second day [mn] 

140.17 153.16 B: oh i see well i i suppose the nice thing about that is you get a greater variety of uh the things that you do the way i do it i ride the bicycle and if i don't ride i probably walk 

153.08 164.11 B: um and uh it so as long as the weather is okay there's no problem and of course if the weather is bad then that means i don't get my exercise in 

153.15 154.09 A: mhm 

164.02 176.51 A: right yeah but i i think i think you're at that advantage of you know being outside and there's the constantly changing scene uh in the gym and it's it's what made me stop the first time you know you don't 

164.55 165.84 B: so but 

176.51 187.65 A: unless you're very patient and you're waiting to see some sort of resor- result you don't have an immediate you know gratification from just running on a machine or you know using some sort of weight machine 

187.45 188.72 B: right 

188.09 190.32 A: which is a bit of a disappointment 

190.20 194.29 B: have you uh found any results in your 

194.37 198.80 B: uh what would you say your body system as a result of your exercise 

198.63 205.39 A: oh yeah sure i mean i i'm i'm much more alert and um i can i can sort of attack 

205.65 212.56 A: you know because i'm working at night i think the exercise is balancing what i lose in sleep 

212.35 213.96 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

212.39 224.20 A: at night time so i'm j- i'm just more in generally more fit even even the more so than before when i was you know sleeping regularly night times and awake during the day so 

216.22 217.24 B: uh-huh 

222.87 230.90 B: right have you found that you've lost weight or made any difference say in your blood pressure or cholesterol 

225.48 226.05 A: (( [cough] )) 

230.51 239.34 A: yeah yeah all of it all of it's it's going yeah the my my weight's going down well actually no [cough] i have to correct that my my weight seems to be 

239.65 245.99 A: stable but it seems to be that it's uh i'm losing fat and gaining muscle which 

245.38 246.85 B: (( mm i think )) 

246.13 257.46 A: is i guess the goal so [laughter] yeah and do you do you do anything for your upper body um because i'm i'm not sure bicycling is primarily a lower body [mn] mm 

247.74 251.35 B: i guess that's supposed to be good right [laughter] 

255.13 269.35 B: [mn] no uh that's the trouble uh it doesn't do anything for your upper body at all and i really don't do anything that's what my wife keeps tells me i should go to the the uh fitness center and do something uh 

269.20 278.28 B: for the upper body but i just uh i just don't get to that i do the biking and um just moving around and that's about it 

277.88 289.14 A: yeah i i figure that since you too since we live in the northeast there's a likelihood that we walk and you know get out a lot more than lots of people i imagine 

288.59 291.57 B: uh th- that's absolutely uh 

290.63 292.41 A: yeah 

291.62 302.17 B: i i know the as a result of the biking my my wife and i ended up going on a couple of bicycle trips where i was be able to utilize my 

298.96 300.54 A: (( oh that's fantastic )) 

302.01 312.95 B: exercise uh in that regard and uh she was in good shape anyway because of all the exercise that she does but uh we found it very exhilarating 

309.99 311.68 A: mhm 

312.36 315.89 A: so what was it in the here here in jersey or was that 

314.95 321.63 B: it was actually an elder hostel uh trip uh over in europe uh 

320.78 321.97 A: (( oh fantastic )) 

321.68 328.98 B: we went to france one time we went to denmark another and then another we went to italy and austria 

328.42 333.49 A: uh austria must've been were you in the at the mountainous part of austria that must've been 

332.18 337.66 B: well yeah [mn] we did a little bit of mountains but not too much because uh 

337.64 351.88 B: uh well [mn] it's lucky because all the time we were there in austria it rained every day [laughter] but you bicycle whether it rains or not you have a set schedule and you must go from one location to another location 

343.83 346.46 A: oh geez [laughter] 

347.40 349.12 A: right 

351.78 360.08 B: so that's why it's it's good that you're [sigh] uh you know your legs are in shape your breathing is good and you just keep going 

357.34 358.18 A: uh-huh 

360.00 367.23 A: hm that that that sounds that sounds great i have a friend who is actually he's a he's a postal carrier in amsterdam 

366.94 368.81 B: oh yes okay 

367.95 371.62 A: and so and he he so he he has one of those special 

371.51 384.57 A: bicycles that that their postal service uses with you know the big basket up front and he bicycles along the canals and in the summertimes when he gets the very long vacation that that that you know europeans get 

376.14 377.54 B: yes 

384.34 390.04 A: you know he bicycles from from the netherlands down to italy and back and stuff like that 

389.18 399.66 B: yes well that's the the nice thing about i think exercise whether it's bicycling or doing anything else you can go hiking or walking or biking 

399.45 402.00 B: and you always meet other people 

401.67 402.53 A: (( mm )) 

401.78 414.84 B: and it gives you an opportunity to have a discussion and talk with them about where they come from what they do and it is a i think it it's an excellent way to get out and and meet people 

414.73 420.80 A: i i i like the biking tour idea i think and i'll probably look into it at some future date 

418.64 419.80 B: yeah it's 

420.15 430.86 B: yes it's it's uh it is something very very good to do uh uh we've as i said done it and you go on a trip with uh maybe about nineteen people 

420.96 422.30 A: [laughter] so mm 

430.96 441.38 B: and that's all uh so that it's it's not a great big crowd of people and you average mm roughly about thirty five miles per day that you uh you pedal 

441.23 442.09 A: wow 

442.00 443.44 B: and then you 

442.30 445.73 A: i- it must be a fantastic way to see the country 

445.15 459.80 B: uh yes it is it it's uh very interesting because you don't just see the city you see out in the countryside and uh that's what's nice and it also gives you an opportunity to meet the people in the country it's amazing how 

459.57 472.98 B: people on the side of the road all wave and say hello and uh you you get a a chance to stop and talk and have a little bite to eat and uh see some of the uh the local people there 

472.11 474.78 A: mhm are are you following the tour de france 

475.08 477.73 B: uh yes i do yes 

476.81 478.54 A: yeah 

477.63 491.14 B: uh uh we uh are kind of interested in that because my son has done a lot of bicycling not ever ridden the tour de france but uh he has done some in the here in the united states and uh 

484.95 485.81 A: (( ah )) 

491.17 497.30 B: uh he's he's now i guess you would say in the senior group [laughter] [laughter] so uh 

495.22 496.30 A: (( ow wow )) 

497.42 506.78 B: um but these those guys sure do uh um a lot of fast travelling and up and down those mountains uh boy that's tough biking 

504.35 509.50 A: oh yeah its' incredible and faster and faster every year too 

508.74 510.50 B: uh that that is true 

509.89 510.69 A: (( [laughter] )) 

510.47 520.78 B: but i guess the main thing with exercise like with the biking is you don't have to go fast as long as you keep going all the time that's for our purposes anyway 

513.71 515.45 A: mhm 

517.38 519.65 A: that's true that 

520.74 529.94 B: and i'm sure that's probably true with you you go to the gym uh it isn't necessarily how fast you walk on the treadmill but you keep going and going 

520.84 521.91 A: yeah that 

529.64 532.47 A: no definitely i mean it's it's not a it's not how 

532.45 537.81 A: sometimes it's not even how much weight you're lifting it's you know that you finish the steps 

537.68 549.00 A: you know and you you complete the cycle so that your body sort of gets used to that cycle and then once its comfortable with that then you can start you know building up in whatever direction you want to go 

542.41 543.49 B: (( mhm )) 

546.77 547.75 B: right 

548.60 553.25 B: do your friends also exercise with you or you pretty much go on your own 

551.49 552.84 A: (( uh )) 

553.52 563.68 A: one one of my friends does uh but unfortunately he he's an a- well but some of my my co workers uh some of my friends form work 

555.74 556.64 B: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

563.81 569.47 A: say that they're planning to try to get into it but they never have you know quite enough 

568.28 570.96 B: the commitment [laughter] 

569.36 580.53 A: commitment to it because you know new york city's full of distraction and [laughter] it's easier to go to a bar [laughter] than to a gym and that some time 

573.98 575.34 B: (( yes )) 

577.12 578.60 B: uh yes 

579.79 593.72 B: well the nice thing about new york city 'cause i worked there for a number of years thirty eight to be exact and i used to do a lot of walking from where i got into the bus terminal and used to walk up to thir- fifty third street every day 

585.83 586.55 A: (( oh )) 

593.68 594.87 A: oh wow 

594.21 599.96 B: and so i got my exercise in the morning even though i would ride the bus coming fr-
