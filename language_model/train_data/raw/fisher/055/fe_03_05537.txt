301.32 306.78 A: um i don't know if i'll be doing any weight training or anything i really i mean i haven't [noise] 

306.99 321.97 A: it's hard for me to [noise] to find a routine and stick with it because my schedule is so variable it's it's easier for me to make a commitment to a standing weekly soccer game play a pick playing pick up soccer or something like that that's 

317.92 319.21 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

322.02 326.70 A: that that works a lot better with my schedule than something more [noise] 

327.07 335.87 A: more more regular if i say four days a week i'm gonna get out and run [noise] this many miles then i i end up not following through 

336.78 350.34 B: hm mm yah but here like i've seen more people you know like whenever they find time they go for jogging or something because i find like people in jogging and that all like walking the day and even in the night so i don't know maybe that can work out 

337.91 339.19 A: [noise] 

340.57 342.04 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

343.38 344.81 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

346.23 347.69 A: [noise] 

349.40 353.09 A: yeah for me if it's not on the calendar it doesn't happen [noise] 

352.30 353.64 B: [laughter] 

353.22 358.09 A: if i say after it when i find time i might as well never say just i'll never do it 

358.19 360.73 A: it's it's all the same i've got to 

361.14 368.93 A: i've got to actually have a time that i've got to be there and a group of people waiting on me or it won't happen [noise] 

367.86 369.01 B: (( [mn] oh okay )) 

369.06 373.81 A: when i was in school and i had all kinds of free time on my hands it was easy but now 

373.85 382.11 A: now i'm married and that puts on a couple of pounds just in itself and then plus then i was more active and now i'm more sedentary in my work and so it's 

377.15 378.34 B: [laughter] 

382.42 383.27 A: the 

382.46 383.15 B: (( uh-huh )) 

383.36 389.17 A: i don't know there are only so many hours in the day [noise] when i had more free time i would find time to run but now 

389.42 394.61 A: [noise] i'm so squeezed as it is that if i'm if i have any kind of excuse at all i just don't 

394.84 395.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

395.05 400.20 B: hm maybe like so your office hours are like fixed or is like variable hours like 

396.90 397.98 A: [noise] 

399.58 402.61 A: very v- variable [noise] 

401.15 406.17 B: okay that's a problem because that really doesn't allow you to plan things properly and you know uh 

403.32 405.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

405.37 406.43 A: (( no )) 

406.26 407.32 B: (( yah so )) 

406.70 409.16 A: i mean like two or three things a week i can 

409.22 420.23 A: i can pick and say okay this is gonna stick and tell someone 'look i need to go' but from day to day i couldn't i i have no idea what time i'll be home tomorrow [noise] i couldn't even tell ya 

419.86 423.18 B: (( like okay uh that's bad really yeah that's really )) 

421.92 427.63 A: yeah so that that makes it difficult to uh to take part at a gym or to have a 

427.64 438.58 A: a regular free time exercise routine [noise] because once you miss a couple of days then it's oh well i don't it it's just hard to get back in the habit [noise] 

430.17 431.48 B: mhm mhm uh 

434.07 436.59 B: yah and then your muscles start aching 

437.15 439.88 B: yah and you only first start something also 

438.62 441.07 A: making it a regular habit is 

441.43 443.01 A: is everything you know 

442.72 453.16 B: yah yah yah that really is mm and because like if you do if you don't do things regularly like people once a while then your b- whole body starts aching and like yeah that's really is a problem so 

446.93 448.29 A: [noise] 

449.23 451.98 A: [noise] yeah 

452.30 457.46 A: plus mentally it's hard to stay in it if you're not if you're not in the habit [noise] 

454.15 456.24 B: mhm 

457.49 468.88 A: you know it's it's hard to it's hard to convince yourself to go work out unless you've been working out every other day for a couple of weeks and now it's just part of your routine you're you're accustomed to it mentally also [noise] 

457.67 458.33 B: (( mm )) 

468.62 475.31 B: yah uh that's really it's like [lipsmack] we have uh like a a tennis court like i only used to play tennis but it's like a big 

471.15 473.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

474.18 475.95 A: uh-huh i love tennis 

475.57 487.25 B: yah i also love it but it's like you know uh some a mile or something it's one half mile and i don't have a car so you know it's [noise] really like sometimes you feel i want to play but then it's so far that i feel 

481.19 482.25 A: yeah 

487.38 496.79 B: you know that kind of thing i mean [noise] you don't go one day then next you all just feel okay only one day so yah i miss the tennis really it's like that really it's like the 

489.09 490.00 A: yeah 

493.18 494.16 A: [noise] 

495.10 495.86 A: ten- 

496.35 505.28 A: i feel like tennis would be easier if my wife were a tennis player [noise] but she's not very athletic and uh i mean she's very [noise] very thin but she's not [noise] an athletic or 

499.49 500.72 B: mhm 

505.45 514.68 A: a [noise] not a sports person and [noise] so any time i go play tennis for an hour that's an hour that i [noise] don't get to spend with [noise] my wife [noise] and it makes it difficult for me to get into 

507.28 508.66 B: (( okay yes okay )) 

515.14 521.27 A: into a [noise] sport very [noise] much when when that's [noise] time that we're apart [noise] rather than time we can share [noise]
