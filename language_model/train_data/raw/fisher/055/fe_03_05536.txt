161.98 169.06 A: said i didn't need to come there any more and i should go somewhere else and i never never did that [laughter] so um i've just kind of fallen out of the practice so 

164.70 165.65 B: really 

165.77 167.33 B: [laughter] 

168.55 173.19 B: yeah it's hard when somebody's not there with you to you know to where you have to do it so 

171.09 172.13 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

172.44 180.30 A: yeah yeah it's it's it's it's it's one of the things where the doctor recommended joining a like or something 'cause 

180.34 187.86 A: if for one thing if if you're paying your money you know you you [laughter] feel more obligated to go and you know you 'cause 'cause you you've got something invested uh 

184.29 186.61 B: you're absolutely right [laughter] 

187.30 196.06 B: [laughter] yeah but something in your basement that's one thing but if you're paying money to you know forty dollars a month or something like that you really want to get your money's worth so you might you might consider going [laughter] 

193.35 194.47 A: oh yeah 

195.07 202.19 A: yep yep yeah we don't even the luxuries of having a basement down here so we have to take take up room in in r- in the regular house so [laughter] 

198.77 199.70 B: yeah 

200.61 209.13 B: [laughter] yeah listen to me saying basement i'm from florida there's not a basement in the whole state down there [laughter] [laughter] it's easy for us we could just throw all those things down in the basement so 

202.33 203.30 A: (( uh no )) 

204.13 205.87 A: (( [laughter] no )) 

208.18 213.46 A: yeah that's right that's right i guess it's like having a whole er an whole whole extra floor of the house on the 

209.31 210.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

212.73 215.55 B: yeah it's awesome it's and you get to play around with it too 

213.65 214.50 A: yeah 

215.41 216.76 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

215.85 218.85 B: you don't have to make it look nice you can do whatever you want [laughter] 

217.75 220.94 A: that's right that's right oh but um 

220.97 223.45 A: (( now er is is it easier )) 

223.81 227.70 A: for you do you get any exercise outside in the winter or do you get quite a bit of snow up there 

226.07 226.89 B: yeah 

227.06 232.57 B: yeah i love the winter so first for some strange reason coming from florida i actually love the winter 

232.17 233.22 A: (( oh yeah )) 

232.56 241.79 B: and everybody usually moves from up here to florida but i did the other thing and moved from there to here [laughter] and i go outside all the time more in the winter than i do in the summer 

235.61 236.39 A: (( yeah [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

241.24 242.25 A: (( oh really )) 

241.64 254.52 B: yeah i go s- i try to do everything snowboarding and skiing and snow shooting and all that kind of stuff i love outside i just love being outside that to me is a rewarding form of exercise rather than just sit standing still or doing something [laughter] 

244.82 246.27 A: oh okay [lipsmack] 

248.30 249.61 A: oh yeah yeah 

253.49 255.88 A: well yeah yeah it just it's 

255.97 260.10 A: you get e- you get enjoyment plus your your side benefit of the exercising 

259.56 269.00 B: right you don't even think about the fact that you're exercising sometimes [laughter] you just try to enjoy it outside and yeah so even in snow as a matter of fact you know it's even more of an exercise a lot of the times and 

261.27 262.20 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

268.37 269.82 A: oh yeah yeah 

268.99 277.70 B: i've even tried ice climbing before which was a hell of an exercise [laughter] it's not in my routine but you know maybe once a winter but it's something different 

271.59 273.40 A: ew i can imagine yeah 

274.07 275.63 A: [laughter] 

276.24 277.17 A: yeah 

277.31 291.76 A: well the f- the few times i've been skiing it's er well it it's even harder because 'cause since we only do it you know once every few [laughter] years but but uh you know the the sidestepping up the up the hill and and everything else i mean you know it's that's a lot of work 

283.38 284.87 B: absolutely [laughter] 

287.80 290.06 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

290.67 292.61 B: [laughter] you feel it at the end of the day 

292.04 295.23 A: oh yeah oh yeah [noise] yep yeah 

294.22 299.31 B: it it's harder in florida 'cause everything's so flat and it's so hot outside all the time so 

298.48 306.39 A: yeah yeah although it's just l- it's like wh- when i go to work in the morning it's it's like seventy seven degrees and and eighty percent humidity it's 

303.80 304.71 B: (( oh yeah )) 

305.33 307.01 B: humidity's up there yep 

306.41 313.67 A: yeah so can you even even if you wanted to exercise early before before you go into work it's still it's still very uncomfortable yeah 

311.25 318.47 B: it's still already so warm and the humidity's what really kills you down there so it just doesn't make you feel like you want to exercise [laughter] 

314.07 316.53 A: (( hm yeah )) 

317.48 320.13 A: yeah well and then then then in the summer 

320.29 327.82 A: well i'm in orlando and in the summer it's it's like today it rains just about every afternoon so that that takes [laughter] that kills that too yeah 

325.04 325.78 B: yeah 

327.21 331.93 B: yeah you can count on it like clock clock work you know it's gonna rain and it's gonna rain hard every afternoon [laughter] 

328.64 333.45 A: yeah yeah l- yeah well lots of excuses not to exercise 

333.12 341.41 B: yeah [laughter] it's tough i mean you got basically you just got to stay indoors down there which is terrible but the only way to do it 

333.66 338.10 A: [laughter] but um 

339.45 350.23 A: [mn] oh yeah well that well that's why we were thinking about about the treadmill you know we could [noise] just put it in in the family room here and and and watch t._v. instead of sitting being a couch potato we could be a treadmill potato 

349.94 360.41 B: yeah it's a hell of an idea [laughter] i don't know how well i wouldn't be able to keep that but good luck with it [laughter] for me i mean i just love laying on the couch when i'm there i don't like to work when i'm home it's just tough 

350.28 352.11 A: [laughter] yeah yeah 

354.89 356.29 A: oh yeah yeah 

357.95 360.70 A: (( mhm [laughter] [mn] )) 

360.24 370.58 B: that's why i guess with a basement it maybe maybe it would make a difference with something like that 'cause it's another room another area another level [laughter] maybe they can treat it as just a workout place or something [laughter] 

363.28 364.22 A: (( yeah )) 

366.67 368.16 A: yeah oh yeah well 

369.58 376.89 A: yeah well what what i find is if if i come home come home from work and and sit down and read the paper right away or something like that then then 

376.84 386.44 A: for some reason the whole evening's shot but if i if i come home and and actually start doing something you know and i just change my clothes and go out and piddle around the yard or in the garage and then 

384.07 384.91 B: right 

386.33 397.08 A: then i do get a little bit of a little bit of exercise that way it's not you know formal cardiovascular exercise or anything but but it's but it's better yeah but it's better than just sitting sitting down all all evening so 

392.11 394.83 B: no but it's better than not at all 

396.36 409.05 B: yeah i agree i'm the same way if i if i come in if i start something like you said you know paper t._v. anything that's it it's not like i'm gonna do that for an hour [noise] and then get up and go exercise [laughter] that's it i'm done for the night [laughter] yeah i'm the same way 

402.28 403.09 A: yep 

405.20 408.53 A: oh yeah [laughter] oh yeah 

408.62 412.26 A: yep yep um wh- and where are you at in connecticut 

411.61 415.30 B: i'm in uh willington it's a very small city northeast 

415.50 421.55 B: right next to the university of connecticut it's about th- thirty forty miles east of harvard 

415.76 416.94 A: (( mhm oh )) 

421.08 422.03 A: oh okay 

422.16 426.61 B: about northeast nice up here it's there's no cities or anything where i am so 

422.66 423.58 A: (( right )) 

423.95 425.09 A: oh yeah 

426.17 429.36 A: yeah yeah well that's [mn] 

430.18 438.54 A: you know i'm i'm just the opposite of i guess everybody else in the world everybody wants to move move down to down here to orlando and i'm i'm ready to move back or move up north so 

438.73 440.79 B: good you're like me [laughter] 

438.86 448.27 A: yeah yeah i've yeah i've been down here well shoot um about forty five years and so you know before disney and all that stuff so it's 

440.91 441.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

444.67 445.65 B: wow 

448.45 453.31 A: see- seeing all the all the change and it's it's definitely not all been for the better so 

452.68 464.39 B: no you especially i mean being in orlando it must have been beautiful before all that and now orlando's it's a completely different place completely i mean it's pure tourism um uh it's such a different place for you i'm sure [laughter] 

455.96 457.40 A: oh yeah yeah 

458.78 459.55 A: yep 

459.63 460.49 A: yep 

461.49 462.54 A: oh yeah 

463.71 466.14 A: yeah it is it's a it's it's 

466.91 472.64 A: it's it's not as not as much fun when you have to have to fight the traffic and the crowds and everything else everywhere you go so 

470.47 480.39 B: yeah i can't imagine how you do [laughter] i can't imagine how you do that [laughter] yeah i don't blame you coming up north would be nice the weather gets cooler and the mountains get bigger and everything changes [laughter] 

473.89 475.44 A: yeah but uh 

479.03 483.35 A: yep yep but uh um yeah they 

483.61 494.69 A: yeah we we do have a pool in the yard so we do get a little ex- a little exercise that wa- that way um it's it's something that it's not super big where you can swim a lot of laps or anything but you know you can 

487.98 490.32 B: well that's excellent exercise actually 

493.59 494.40 B: right 

494.64 500.44 A: probably ten or fifteen strokes to get from one end to the other and just just try to keep at it 

499.81 502.94 B: [noise] yeah trainers say that's one of the best exercises you can do 

500.50 501.06 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

502.66 506.77 A: oh yeah yeah well my wife likes to get out uh with 

507.39 508.55 A: um 

508.84 521.10 A: oh i forget what they're called but but the things you can exercise in the water with where um you can you can run in place in in in the pool and and it's it's not hard on your knees because you don't have all the weight you know you have some buoyancy so 

514.54 515.59 B: oh yeah 

517.60 518.42 B: right 

520.48 521.68 B: right 

521.21 523.46 A: so that that helps a little bit 

522.83 526.90 B: that's really good for your especially for your heart too actually if you're moving quite quickly with that 

523.86 524.85 A: yep 

525.35 528.41 A: oh yeah yeah and when you have a lot of resistance so 

528.38 534.83 B: that's not a bad idea that's a way to keep cool and exercise outside in florida that's a great idea actually 

531.07 532.59 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

533.63 536.32 A: yeah well and it's handy to have when you're out 

536.62 543.38 A: hav- having to to cut the grass and everything else you when your down you just kind of rinse off a little bit and with the hose and then jump in the pool so 

539.26 540.54 B: [laughter] 

542.71 547.70 B: that's what we always did with our pool in florida [laughter] whenever we were done with anything outside jump right into the pool 

543.70 545.43 A: (( mm yep )) 

547.36 551.57 A: (( yep and apparently they don't have too much pools up in connecticut do do you )) 

550.67 561.62 B: no it's not very popular up here [laughter] it's too much work in the winter you have to cover them up and you know keep them from freezing and all that stuff [laughter] but in florida i think every house has one [laughter] 

552.08 553.89 A: yeah [laughter] 

554.96 555.67 A: (( yep )) 

557.01 558.69 A: oh yeah yeah 

561.00 562.48 A: oh yeah yeah it's 

562.63 564.98 A: it's it's pretty much standard around here 

564.53 570.44 B: yeah i miss my pool i wish i had it again [laughter] that's one thing i miss about florida having that pool [laughter] 

565.24 566.91 A: (( it's um )) 

567.18 568.38 A: [laughter] 

569.65 574.33 A: [lipsmack] oh yeah yeah but but you you but you wouldn't miss the heat though that that does get old after a while 

573.41 580.93 B: no i agree you're right [laughter] you're absolutely right i couldn't do any of the outdoor things i do now if i in florida i just couldn't stand it [laughter] 

577.60 578.55 A: (( yeah )) 

578.59 579.83 A: (( yeah yeah ))
