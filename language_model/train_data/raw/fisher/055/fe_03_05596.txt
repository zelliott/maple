117.81 118.92 A: um 

118.94 128.84 A: that's about it like i haven't i've rally just gone about my business i haven't been worrying too much about it you know 'cause i'm gonna let something like that like worry my life forever you know 

127.52 128.40 B: mhm 

128.54 132.83 B: [mn] i feel the same way i don't think there's anything that we can really 

133.02 136.43 B: do to prevent it i mean there

157.93 159.29 A: yeah exactly 

158.75 162.00 B: might as well just live your life and not worry about it 

161.37 166.43 A: yeah like if death is meant to come upon you it'll come upon you know you can't avoid it 

165.55 166.47 B: mhm 

167.22 177.97 B: you know we had a lot of problems 'cause a lot of people turned racists where i worked and that was a shame because we have a lot of uh a lot of middle eastern people where i work 

178.02 182.78 B: and they were just as horrified by it so i felt bad about that but 

183.00 185.21 A: yeah exactly you can't blame 

184.77 194.37 B: yeah exactly they ended up having to make this policy that um an- any discrimination will result in firing 'cause they were having a problem 

194.90 196.64 A: oh yeah i can imagine 

195.91 197.71 B: yeah

215.59 216.70 A: yeah 

216.18 218.85 B: and then this time it was really bad 

218.59 220.05 A: (( um )) 

220.81 223.63 B: [noise] were you able to see it from where you were 

223.57 229.02 A: but uh not not really i couldn't see it because i was on long island but 

228.70 229.66 B: mhm 

229.29 235.39 A: we saw it on t._v. and things and it was just like crazy it just everybody was in shock 

233.73 234.47 B: did 

234.74 237.71 B: did did you smell it over the next few days 

237.73 239.82 A: uh no not really 

239.32 241.04 B: no i guess you were too far 

240.99 242.09 A: yeah 

241.23 244.95 B: i talked to people in nassau county that could smell it um 

245.36 247.68 B: thirty outside of manhattan 

248.23 253.13 A: uh-huh man i didn't like my school's in nassau and i really didn't smell it 

253.21 255.12 B: yeah is 

255.92 259.19 B: it was really horrible for days it smelt like um 

258.96 273.56 B: i i always used to read books on what war was like and they said it was uh th- the smell of like battlefield where um where human flesh was burned was a terrible smell and they said unless you've been to war you'd never know what that was like and um 

273.46 284.10 B: so i was you know couldn't imagine it and then i i i knew what that smell was afterwards i felt like you know i i'm smelling it i'm probably breathing in the ashes of dead people so 

284.07 285.62 A: (( yeah it doesn't )) 

284.39 285.65 B: it was really 

285.89 289.41 A: and that was like the tallest building in the city so you could imagine you know 

289.27 299.69 B: yeah it was really hard to get over it everything was covered in dust it was really awful so you know we're all literally choking on the ashes of these dead people 

299.65 301.04 A: yeah uh 

299.98 303.47 B: it was pretty pretty nasty experience 

303.68 305.61 A: (( yeah but )) 

304.57 305.64 B: (( but uh )) 

305.62 314.90 A: yeah but as far as changes like nothing really i just you know maybe i become more observant of people like on a train and bus but that's about it nothing real 

314.08 316.53 B: how about more patriotic 

316.96 320.56 A: patriotic well i don't know because 

320.79 330.44 A: as far as that goes like people also now realize that they're americans they all have the flags when before that happened no one really raised their flag or had a flag you know 

327.20 328.36 B: mhm 

330.26 331.32 B: yeah 

330.73 336.03 A: so i don't know i've always been the same as far as pride in the country you know 

336.38 341.55 B: oh so you always had then you were one of those ones who had to some extent or another 

341.65 342.93 A: yeah you know like 

342.29 343.84 B: yeah 

343.22 350.73 A: um i i'm not really one to fly the flag all the time but you know i have pride you know you get opportunity in this country you know that i wouldn't 

347.31 348.40 B: (( mhm )) 

350.00 355.62 B: yeah same here i i like it but i've got mixed feelings of course our country does good things and bad things 

355.42 359.08 A: yeah like we're no angels either like this country so 

356.08 357.51 B: so you know you gotta 

358.01 358.91 B: no 

359.75 360.56 A: (( you know )) 

360.20 365.03 B: i i i wonder how other countries see us some of whom think we're assholes 

365.17 367.22 A: yeah i can imagine you know 

367.31 370.38 B: like those french i wonder they think they you know 

370.53 371.55 A: yeah 

370.93 375.59 B: th- they're not too happy with us because we give them a hard time for not joining the war 

375.69 387.76 A: yeah 'cause they i guess people i guess the government feels like if you don't want our system of government then you go down with those you know you go down until you become democratic or whatever yeah 

387.34 388.12 B: (( [noise] )) 

388.45 392.81 B: yeah somehow even though i like our government here i don't feel like we can 

392.92 405.70 B: re- uh like we should be in if we're really for freedom we shouldn't be telling them what to do we should like show by example that we're leading the good life and hope that they wanna change just um because they see it's successful for us 

405.54 411.11 B: but if we're shoving it down their throats then we're doing some of the same things that we're saying that they're doing 

410.79 413.79 A: yeah like for iraq like the way they they force it 

412.96 414.58 B: (( mhm )) 

413.83 419.47 A: democratic and just force it out and for a excuse that's not really there you know like 

418.84 422.34 B: mhm yeah they never found anything 

419.84 420.74 A: so 

422.06 429.04 A: yeah and they wanted to go to war with north korea and i- iran too like they wanna go 

429.14 431.40 A: to war war with everybody that's you know 

431.42 433.97 B: north korea just wanted um 

434.13 448.42 B: food and medicines and um since the u._s. had cut off aid they just you know they only going to make nuclear weapons just to sell them so that they could get food and medicine so that they weren't starving and lacking medical care so 

449.31 450.72 A: (( but i don't know )) 

450.16 461.97 B: that that was kinda stupid we could have just you know lifted the embargoes and let them have food and medicine and then they would have shut up and not been interested in nuclear weapons anyway 

462.00 463.45 A: yeah 

462.89 464.87 B: even though that guy is a nut 

465.26 466.20 A: yeah 

465.57 467.10 B: kim jong il 

467.23 468.98 A: yeah 

468.52 470.63 B: or whatever his name is yeah 

470.05 472.43 A: does he live in a communist society 

472.73 474.94 B: mhm it 

473.85 478.38 A: so i guess it's just bush bush doesn't like people that doesn't his way [noise] i guess 

478.40 480.26 B: yeah oh 

479.16 481.39 A: and he convinces people to join his way 

481.40 485.86 B: it is pretty harsh in those countries but then again you know 

485.88 492.85 B: you gotta let them see that for themselves if you force it on them we're kinda like doing the same thing we're saying they're doing 

492.77 496.17 A: (( yeah but i don't know )) 

494.13 495.10 B: so 

496.57 499.42 A: well yeah like um i don't know like 

497.18 497.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

499.62 503.93 A: i guess it will be an experience to say that you lived through nine eleven but 

503.31 504.62 B: mhm 

504.11 515.71 A: i i i don't know like it hasn't really changed me dramatically you know maybe i've noticed more when i've seen nine eleven on the time like on the time like oh nine eleven or something like that you know 

515.91 516.61 A: or 

516.02 530.41 B: yeah i guess it it's probably i i wish i was out in long island i i did not want to be in the city if i could undo it if i could've changed anything i would have made sure i was on vacation or something i mean i i'm not sorry that i i helped out but uh 

521.36 522.11 A: yeah 

530.47 531.43 B: you know 

531.48 535.14 B: it leaves me really unpleasant memories that i i can't ditch 

535.28 537.82 A: (( yeah so )) 

536.89 537.91 B: so 

538.41 539.74 A: (( yeah i can imagine )) 

538.51 539.93 B: you know i i 

540.12 544.34 A: if you really inside the the building too you know and you're trying to help 

544.23 552.64 B: yeah b- but you know going near the building seeing it breathing in the dust y- you know 

553.13 555.67 B: he- helping with that people it was just you know 

555.80 558.85 B: i just wanna put it out of my head but [sigh] 

559.23 563.00 B: i guess eventually with time it gets dimmer but still you know 

563.51 564.20 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

563.55 565.43 B: i would have rather not been there 

565.86 568.33 A: yeah i can imagine but people actually 

568.78 575.17 A: were more curious than wanna be there just i guess to experience but it's noth- nothing you really want to experience 

574.68 580.64 B: nobody actually there weren't many people who were curious people were running the hell away to get out of there 

580.47 581.83 A: oh yeah 

581.24 589.70 B: there were very few people who were curious about anything they wanted everybody was in a panic trying to get away except for the people trying to help out 

589.12 590.49 A: oh right 

589.89 594.80 B: but there were surprisingly a lot of people wanted to help out and even you know 

595.73 599.96 B: didn't even worry to much about their own getting in you know in
