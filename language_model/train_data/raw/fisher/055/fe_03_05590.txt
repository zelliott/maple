75.05 78.19 B: the only way i've changed my outlook or 

78.15 90.40 B: any significant changes is that like i'm standing near a bus stop there's a package there like i'm kind of wary of it um i would say i recently i went down cyclone do you know where that is

91.80 94.61 B: you know the rollercoaster in coney island

102.14 104.27 B: although that's a racist remark 

104.31 108.22 B: you know it still kinda made me feel wary because you know it's 

109.01 111.96 B: yeah i i don't know it just did 

111.27 120.57 A: uh-huh and are you like are you am- like american or like how like where's your ancestry from

121.84 123.04 A: okay cool 

123.46 128.23 A: so do you think um you're gonna feel that type of nervousness 

128.28 130.63 A: at bus stations or in 

130.92 145.22 A: other places like do you think it's gonna be something that's like longterm for the rest of your life or do you think it's something that you'll like it'll get you know less and less intense or it'll completely go away 

132.85 134.43 B: oh absolutely [noise] 

144.11 156.59 B: i really i really c- can't say that's it's going to take that kinda of affect on me because i've like been exposed to a completely different aspect of terrorism i was in israel 

156.68 158.60 B: approximately four years ago 

158.86 165.48 B: and uh literally i was standing across the street and b- and uh somebody walked into a bank and blew themselves up so 

165.17 166.10 A: wow 

166.15 177.29 B: um you know after witnessing that um i mean it is definitely horrible and horrific what happened and i'm actually very lucky that you know i came out pretty much unscarred 

176.93 177.98 A: yeah 

177.40 178.74 B: [noise] but um 

179.38 191.51 B: it's just that i've seen the way people react and act there when it occurs on a daily basis unfortunately and they just 

191.64 199.43 B: they take it as unfortunately as a regular thing and live through it i mean they uh they take it as a 

199.78 200.72 A: wow 

201.55 203.84 B: as a part of their lives and then 

203.88 206.43 B: well and it's for the rest of their lives 

206.19 207.59 A: that's tough 

207.90 208.97 B: it is 

209.00 218.07 B: pretty difficult it's really it's assuming more difficult for people who live like that you know i don't wanna get into too much of a political discussion but i would definitely say that 

213.15 214.02 A: uh-huh 

219.69 221.87 B: it's just something that's 

222.21 229.33 B: unfortunately is inevitable and there's very little that an individual can do about it 

228.56 232.53 A: yeah that's true [noise] it's very true 

233.82 235.12 B: what's your perspective 

234.46 236.12 A: i think my like 

236.39 239.08 A: i don't know if it [sigh] 

239.59 242.46 A: i don't think it's changed anything for me 

243.03 245.66 A: at all really like 

246.23 253.23 A: i moved here september tenth so and then it happened you know the next day 

253.30 256.82 A: so i was living you know 

257.03 263.28 A: first time really living in new york in the new york metro area 

263.64 270.15 A: and uh just started you know it was a week before i was gonna start working just graduated college 

270.19 273.67 A: and i didn't know anybody in the area so it was kind of like 

274.25 285.23 A: it was definitely like a powerful experience i guess like listening to it having friends and family in the city and not being able to watch 

285.65 294.31 A: 'cause i didn't have like t._v. or internet or anything so i listened to everything on the radio and it was really powerful to to listen to 

291.35 291.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

294.45 302.64 A: and i mean it was pretty surreal i think for everybody when it happened 'cause it just didn't seem believable but it made us feel even 

303.04 317.02 A: i guess a little bit more surreal or or something and a few days later you know i went into the city and just to be with a couple of friends that were you know going through it or whatever i had a friend that 

317.45 324.32 A: was coming out of the subway at the world trade when it happened and she was pretty screwed up she kind i don't know like 

324.97 328.28 A: [mn] but i don't think i don't know like 

328.33 331.94 A: i think if somebody's gonna do something that kills me 

333.31 347.07 A: it is like you know it's gonna it's gonna happen whether i want it to or not you know whe- when it comes to something like terrorism it's kind of like an nat- it's almost like it's a natural event you know 

347.23 352.83 B: [noise] well the difficulty with that is is that unless you are able to 

353.49 356.63 B: prevent it by being preemptive 

356.15 357.09 A: uh-huh 

357.23 361.24 B: there is really nothing one person can do about it 

360.66 370.37 A: yeah and i know that there's nothing i personally can do to be pre- preemptive about it so if there's nothing i can do 

370.37 376.93 A: to stop a complete stranger from strapping a bomb on and you know getting on a bus with me then 

377.19 378.94 A: you know i 

379.00 381.87 A: try not to think i don't know it 

381.66 383.33 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

382.33 385.68 A: i try not to think that that's gonna happen [laughter] i guess 

385.78 388.14 B: or just miss the bus [noise] 

387.77 389.50 A: yeah 

389.26 391.08 B: [noise] i understand um 

391.91 400.30 B: but do you think uh what do you think is gonna happen like for example the people's kids out there that witnessed it like for example 

400.33 405.30 B: i have a very young brother he is actually seven years old 

405.57 406.47 A: uh-huh 

405.76 410.68 B: uh and he saw it when he was like he was i think four and a half 

410.51 411.48 A: uh-huh 

412.11 413.10 B: um 

413.91 419.27 A: what do i think they're what do i think they're gonna have from it like growing up 

413.97 415.31 B: it's kinda hard to 

418.21 423.44 B: yeah what kind of an impact i mean because i just think that being so young could be 

423.84 427.06 B: either ignored or very traumatic 

426.17 436.44 A: yeah i think i think that kids are growing i think kids in general especially in the united states are 

436.65 441.22 A: are maturing a lot faster than they were thirty years ago 

441.32 448.92 A: and i think you're exposed to a lot more you're exposed to a lot more pressures you're taught a lot more there's a lot 

441.52 443.28 B: (( absolutely true [noise] )) 

449.13 452.29 A: uh more ways to get information 

452.45 461.27 A: and there's a lot [sigh] of open media and a lot of different ways to find out information so 

461.60 463.05 A: i think that 

464.02 465.00 A: [sigh] 

466.22 469.04 A: that on top of 

469.29 477.97 A: i don't think that terrorism is gonna go away necessarily like i think there's always gonna be people that feel very strongly about something 

478.50 481.09 A: and there's always gonna be people that feel 

481.13 495.74 A: very strongly against that whether it be religion whether it be social issues whether it be economic issues whether it be like anything it's gonna be about something and it's always gonna be there because 

496.92 507.73 A: people you know it's just it's a it seems like it's a natural way for people to think that you know whatever way that they have is better than somebody else's that they don't know 

508.92 517.64 A: and it's kind of troubling and it's kind of frightening and i just i don't know like i don't i think there's gonna be more 

517.41 524.82 A: like my instinct is that there's gonna be a lot more terrorists attacks in the next thirty years than there has been in past thirty years 

524.96 526.72 B: well because 

525.34 528.23 A: and i don't you know like i'm definitely like 

528.43 533.03 A: i don't think that violence brings peace but i think 

532.91 544.97 A: when somebody believes in something so strong that they will die for it because they think that you know whatever it is if they believe in something so strong that they're gonna 

545.07 546.93 A: kill themselves 

547.10 550.77 A: and a whole bunch of people because of it then [mn] 

550.98 553.64 A: you know they're obviously in a mindset that 

553.88 554.88 A: you know 

554.06 557.59 B: there's a pretty cliche saying stating that 

558.15 562.20 B: uh whoever wins is the person who is more determined to it 

562.35 563.26 A: uh-huh 

563.40 572.50 B: i think that it's very true that if a person is extremely determined to whatever and must succeed then most likely he will succeed 

571.50 572.95 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

572.60 577.52 B: and although the price will be very high mostly likely in this situation his own life 

577.86 578.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

579.51 584.14 B: other people cannot really do anything about it but we've already bust that one out i just 

583.25 594.00 A: do you think the terrorists succeeded in what they were planning to do or like i'm not sure i i don't understand the motive really like i don't understand how 

588.67 590.99 B: i think i think they've achieved [noise] 

594.33 597.59 A: killing thousands of people 

598.33 599.95 A: progresses anything
