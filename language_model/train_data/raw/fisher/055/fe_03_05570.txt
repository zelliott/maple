224.97 226.37 A: that is pretty cool 

229.79 241.30 B: so i don't know but i i mean other changes like i walk around with sodium iodide in my po- you know in my pocket so if there's a a radiological event like i can try to protect myself like

247.11 258.49 B: [noise] modern forms of cultural warfare and so like when this shit happened i it was like m- my personal worst nightmare 'cause i'd been telling all my friends for years like dude one day the shit's gonna hit the fan 

258.86 266.67 B: i will never move to new york city 'cause if anything ever happens there if it happens it'll happen there and of course i would up moving to new york city you know 

266.92 275.75 B: so it's crazy man it's a crazy series of events september eleventh like impacted my life directly i lost a lot of friends i have a fre- a couple of friends who were emergency workers 

275.83 277.38 B: and uh

280.58 284.17 A: like three hundred and forty two firefighters died that day 

284.24 285.03 B: (( uh )) 

286.65 288.56 B: yeah crazy 

289.00 297.88 A: i actually heard that you know they lost three hundred and forty some firefighters but then over the next few weeks they lost nine hundred and something they all quit 

298.38 305.03 B: well the city man like bloomberg is like you know 'cause guiliani left office 

305.69 318.92 B: his it happened like a day before elections you know or election day for the mayor of mayoral election and the guy that became the mayor like was like well we gotta f- you know we gotta cut back now we you know we have this huge deficit 

318.89 322.20 B: so he's like we gotta close fire houses ridiculous 

322.92 324.91 B: ridiculous no one likes this mayor 

325.55 331.69 A: yeah he didn't if he knew anything about how those firefighters operated he'd open more fire houses those 

331.54 332.50 B: yeah 

332.01 333.69 A: guys are crazy 

334.24 340.89 B: yeah i mean you know there was like a big stink for a while of course you don't hear anything about it now but like they don't have enough radios you know 

341.14 349.88 A: oh yeah they don't have enough anything there like the thing the things they they do every day like [mn] a firefighter down here would get fired for 

350.06 360.99 A: like we we're not even allowed to be like alone in a burning building ever like a team of two at the very least and you're within sight or speech range of that person all the time 

360.40 361.54 B: yeah 

360.93 367.25 A: but they just pile off trucks they go do their own thing you know they meet up at the end they jump off buildings 

367.46 369.33 A: and those those guys 

369.51 370.44 A: are 

371.11 375.41 A: they they need more of everything more guys more radios more everything 

375.35 377.60 B: more training probably too you know 

377.51 379.81 A: yeah well now they're 

377.91 380.55 B: (( i mean who everyone needs more training you know )) 

379.97 386.63 A: they're they're short people but they can't train new people so they're trying to hire only trained firefighters 

386.83 390.48 A: they're having trouble filling all their spots so they're still missing people 

390.51 391.47 B: yeah 

390.88 394.17 A: i have a lot of friends that put in have applications in up there 

394.39 401.08 A: but they won't get hired until they they finish like all their firefighter training and like paramedic school 

401.33 406.67 B: uh the new york city's a crazy place like i don't know have you been here have you been to the city 

405.76 409.11 A: [noise] i i've been a few times i'm actually coming up later this month uh 

408.67 423.20 B: yeah like you know what like i said for so long like i would never move here and once i moved here like i got it you know like and i'll admit you know i'm addicted to like the good things that the city offers it's a very vibrant environment it's very diverse it's 

423.10 431.30 B: you know like the the axle in which you know many new ideas spin and and radiate out into the world you know 

431.17 442.78 B: but it's it's just so big and there's so many people that like i was a teacher in the public school system in new york city i mean you got one point two million children and one superintendent you know 

442.41 443.69 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

442.75 455.27 B: it's just they they th- the size of this place is is ridiculous you know and you know even manhattan by itself you know like we're a city of i think what is it now eight and a half million people 

455.44 456.43 B: you know 

456.62 467.39 B: it's just and and you know so [noise] things fall through the cracks and like you're saying how like the firefighters you know like they you know the shit that they do the crazy shit like 

467.55 472.21 B: you know when you have a city with so many cops and so ma- you know like 

472.08 484.05 B: they just they don't yo- we had a huge problem here a few years ago with police brutality you know like it's kind of like faded away but you know those were new york city cops that stuck a plunger up a man's ass you know from haiti like 

484.28 491.88 B: so it's it's you know when shit like that and i have a lot of friends both within the i have a lot of friends who are lawyers 

491.65 502.53 B: in the city that uh two three friends who are criminal lawyers in the city and they take people who you know can't afford a lawyer and they're like two of them are public defenders and is one like a you know private private attorney but uh 

503.05 508.11 B: you know man like there's just it's it's so hard to 

508.34 511.58 B: get whip everyone's ass into shape you know 

511.95 512.90 A: yeah 

512.01 514.47 B: it's just so hard there's just too many people 

513.86 516.25 A: that that many people on a little island and yeah yeah 

516.37 528.68 B: yeah it's also like the mentality up here you know like people have the wrong idea about new york it's not an unfriendly place at all it's very friendly it's just that you know no time to dilly dally you know 

528.15 531.37 A: (( um )) 

528.72 540.62 B: no time to like you know decisions must be made quickly and blah blah blah you know it's a very do do do kinda place and i've travelled a lot i used to be in a band i've been all around this country you know 

540.73 545.68 B: there's no place like this place and it's a good thing but it's also a very bad thing you know 

547.12 551.48 B: crazy i don't know but how has your life cha- changed after september eleventh 

552.06 559.96 A: i don't know that i don't really know if it is that might be one of the things that actually pushed me to f- go down and and volunteer at the fire station 

560.69 561.81 A: it it 

562.48 565.19 A: you know it's something that i i probably always wanted to do
