0.67 1.90 B: hello 

1.76 3.11 A: hey how ya doing 

2.51 5.30 B: okay my name's jason 

4.00 4.96 A: [noise] uh 

5.11 6.29 A: i'm gregory 

5.90 7.56 B: [noise] hey gregory 

7.14 9.17 A: (( [noise] so we're talking about health and fitness [noise] )) 

8.71 11.11 B: yeah about exercise 

12.04 13.16 A: (( [noise] so do ya )) 

12.16 15.05 B: so so do [noise] you exercise 

14.72 20.60 A: uh yeah pretty regularly i guess i've been doing it about uh uh three months now every morning 

20.76 28.97 A: push-ups sit-ups in the mornings or before i go to bed i prefer before i go to bed 'cause if i do it before i go to bed then it means i sleep like a baby and i wake up 

28.09 30.67 B: uh-huh [noise] that's great so you do it on your own 

30.49 31.91 A: [noise] yeah 

31.22 44.57 B: yeah i w- i work out at a gym with a friend because i find if i don't do it with someone i'm not quite disciplined enough and it's too easy for me to find other things to do but [noise] also in a gym i find i have a lot more opportunities for different things to do 

33.83 34.65 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

43.16 46.08 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

45.45 54.34 B: so um i think i first started going i wanted to lift weights and i figured there's no way i i have a small apartment so there's no way i could do that at home 

46.09 47.63 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

53.94 56.14 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

54.98 62.80 B: and also just it seemed like it was a little bit more um mm it was nicer to get out of the house to do it so um you 

56.22 57.16 A: [noise] 

62.40 66.80 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

63.81 70.41 B: know that that's kind of nice when the weather's bad it's inconvenient though so [laughter] then it's nicer to do it at home i suppose mhm 

70.15 74.33 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] the only problem i have with going to a gym is that um [mn] 

74.97 78.19 A: i'm so busy in the day i never make time to do it 

78.55 83.94 A: so i end up like i have a membership now [noise] i signed up and i ha- i went once 

85.36 88.56 A: so i mean i end up just wasting money [noise] [noise] 

87.30 90.12 B: [noise] yeah do they let you freeze your membership 

90.24 91.99 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

92.44 95.27 A: i suppose i could but i never thought about it [noise] 

94.52 101.54 B: yeah 'cause i know gyms around here will let you freeze it for like up to six months or something like that like if you're going out of town on business trips 

100.76 104.47 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] oh that's an interesting idea [noise] )) 

101.55 102.90 B: like that 

104.20 105.72 B: yeah but um 

106.05 116.71 B: i mean i guess it's funny 'cause i i more or less exercise 'cause i find it really helps me sit and concentrate 'cause otherwise if i'm [noise] sitting at a desk all day i'll go stir crazy so especially doing aerobics 

111.85 112.84 A: (( mm )) 

115.18 116.38 A: exactly 

116.97 122.95 B: is a really really good thing first thing in the morning um 'cause it's good to burn off steam uh 

122.92 127.43 A: [noise] i i just find it makes everything easier [lipsmack] um 

125.95 126.92 B: (( yep mhm )) 

127.66 141.06 A: staying awake later and driving whatever i'm doing i seem to have a little more power a little more strength [noise] um of course it's a pain in the ass because you know you want to go to bed and you gotta exercise um you know but [lipsmack] 

138.70 139.88 B: (( [laughter] exactly )) 

141.02 148.08 A: it's almost like a drug once you start because you really you miss it like like before you go to bed you'll remember oh i'm gonna exercise 

147.50 148.69 B: right 

148.22 155.79 A: it it really enhances your life i think and and especially [lipsmack] i find that after i've had after i've had a physical 

155.52 156.72 B: yeah 

156.44 159.02 A: let's say you go to a doctor's office you pass people who are 

159.43 165.75 A: really ill that just sort of um sort of put in your head i don't want that to happen to me 

165.06 170.12 B: exactly exactly no definitely um i mean it's funny 'cause it's 

170.23 185.15 B: i mean the exercising part i sort of have down and the next step is just like getting diet in in in place as well and that's one of those things where er i mean i try to eat healthy but then like i just went out for a really like nice lunch and kind of heavy 

180.57 182.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

184.92 192.11 B: and i sort of feel it sitting in my stomach so i was thinking well i'm gonna sit home and at work and then i'm gonna go out to the gym tonight so 

192.24 205.20 B: [laughter] it sort of reminds me that that um i'm always trying to to not overeat and and exactly as you say it's really seeing other people who are very heavy especially when it's hot out and you sort of appreciate 

203.82 205.08 A: mhm 

205.14 208.37 B: appreciate being a little more active so mhm 

207.75 210.42 A: i i've kind of got this philosophy that um 

210.27 222.94 A: i don't know i think i heard i was watching some talk show and tyra banks [noise] was on there and they they asked about her diet and she said that she eats whatever she wants and everyone was amazed and she said partially because she exercises every single day 

222.53 223.72 B: right 

223.24 225.88 A: because you know it's sort of like what goes in 

226.19 228.73 A: [noise] it doesn't stay in it comes out 

228.09 229.39 B: exactly 

228.77 239.46 A: so i i sort of try to live by that philosophy but i'm finding [noise] that [noise] you know with exercise every single day so you have to limit your intake 

232.18 232.78 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

235.13 235.95 B: right 

238.86 240.34 B: (( mhm )) 

239.65 245.80 A: you know like s- let's say you want to eat [noise] steak let's say you only eat one piece instead of two or three [noise] 

245.41 252.80 B: exactly but it's funny that's been one of things i've i've [noise] really learned is that like if i go out to eat and i go to a steakhouse 

252.66 264.71 B: it's like not getting the sixteen [noise] ounce steak instead going for like the ten ounce steak or something like that and i realize you know [noise] that's just enough and and after a while you realize you know it's just getting the flavor of it's enough um 

258.09 259.69 A: mhm 

263.73 267.61 A: i- it it's it's hard when you're used to being full 

268.61 273.31 A: you know there there's that there's that um feeling of being full and being content 

271.56 272.53 B: [noise] 

272.81 274.48 B: right 

274.70 284.29 B: no it's true in fact the biggest struggle i've had is at bed time i'll sometimes really get hungry and for the longest time i had this habit of like having a bowl of cereal 

274.94 275.73 A: (( how )) 

284.23 294.77 B: [laughter] and someone told me at the gym they said oh don't do that that's all carbs and that'll just sit in your system overnight you know and that just turns to fat so i sort of tried to turn that off at night but um 

294.79 296.43 B: it doesn't always work [noise] 

295.47 298.36 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] actually what i found works is um 

298.53 299.65 A: [lipsmack] water 

299.98 303.08 A: if you drink like what is it eight glasses of water a day 

302.47 303.68 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

303.09 309.69 A: you'll not get hungry at at night a lot of times apparently especially when you're hungry your body really wants more water [noise] 

309.14 316.35 B: [noise] right [noise] oh that's a good idea i mean i guess then then at the very least i guess that would take up space in your stomach so 

311.95 312.68 A: (( i mean )) 

315.56 321.19 A: [lipsmack] exactly 'cause you know it's it's actually hard to drink eight glasses of water you really have to force yourself 

320.61 329.71 B: right well except i don't drink coffee so i guess if i if i just like pushed more water [noise] in place of it that might be a good thing 

321.43 322.45 A: because 

326.85 328.82 A: mhm 

329.23 335.37 A: i mean 'cause you know honestly water's nasty [laughter] you know you just have to get in the habit of drinking water 

334.65 342.13 B: yeah i don't know it's actually well again in the summer water to me is like is perfect 'cause it's not too heavy and uh 

342.39 349.39 B: i guess i i can only stand so much sweet you know sweet stuff anyway so that's sort of been my my challenge 

347.60 348.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

349.73 354.42 B: [laughter] um and you know [noise] if i have too much sugar [noise] i tend to have um 

354.55 357.85 B: [noise] [laughter] i get this late afternoon slump [noise] thing so 

357.59 361.48 A: [noise] oh really that that's funny sugar does that huh 

358.94 360.32 B: yeah 

361.75 367.23 B: but uh how many how long do you exercise for you said you do it like especially before bed 

364.80 366.11 A: um 

366.84 374.49 A: um let's see actually it's about uh about fifteen minutes i i've actually been pushing it up a bit to about twenty 

373.87 382.91 B: [noise] 'cause the thing i've always wondered 'cause i there was a period i was exercising at night instead of in the morning [noise] and one of the things [noise] i'd sometimes find and especially when i did an intense 

382.90 393.80 B: aerobic and like ab work out i'd be so wired i couldn't fall asleep like 'til much later and it sort of got my system like re-energized and and 

389.69 390.89 A: (( [noise] )) 

392.11 395.98 A: um well well see [noise] what i found was that 

396.25 407.30 A: [noise] it made me realize i was [noise] not in enough good shape as i thought i was so usually if i end up being um and i'm tired so i push myself to do this exercise and then i'm really tired 

400.14 401.03 B: uh-huh 

406.59 408.18 B: (( right i got ya [noise] )) 

407.79 414.06 A: but then there are those nights when for some reason i cannot fall asleep [noise] and that must [noise] be it just being wired 

410.88 412.73 B: (( [noise] yep )) 

413.76 425.70 B: yeah i don't know i- it didn't happen all the time but it happened often enough i thought well let me try working out in the morning and i try to mix it up like at least two days a week i'll do weights and sometimes three days a week 

416.32 417.92 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

424.11 425.91 A: mhm 

425.75 430.42 B: and then the other two i'll i'll do like an intense like forty minute aerobics or something 

430.18 434.94 A: and it seems like the mornings when you do it in the morning it just really gets the day [noise] going 

435.12 439.57 A: it really just like [noise] like i don't know it's like instant energy bar 

439.05 440.63 B: mhm yeah it is 

440.99 449.37 B: the biggest challenge is is you know carving out the time in the mornings because [laughter] there are many days where i'd rather sleep that extra forty minutes or hour or something like that 

444.37 445.31 A: mhm 

448.78 451.07 A: [noise] oh d- oh definitely definitely 

452.04 457.92 B: so i mean i've sort of i mean i'm sort of in a routine now for the summer which is good um 

458.18 459.59 B: but uh 

459.95 467.48 B: [laughter] i've sort of had this going for about six or nine months so um it's it's actually been working pretty well 

463.25 464.15 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

464.20 465.63 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

467.50 471.25 B: um but i as i say i always try to mix it up a little 'cause i 

468.06 469.26 A: (( [noise] i i'm )) 

471.00 478.86 A: i'm i'm really going i'm really trying to make it a lifestyle and which makes it much more difficult [noise] sort of like um [noise] i don't know if you've ever seen jack la lanne 

478.48 479.37 B: (( yep yep )) 

479.26 483.09 A: you know he's like ninety and still exercises every day 

482.72 489.84 B: yeah well he's like he's like the classic 'cause i think when i was a little kid i remember that he had a t._v. show on him like an exercise show 

488.12 489.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

489.77 497.98 B: and even before it even became a big fitness craze he was the one who uh sort of everyone looked to about exercise especially at home 

491.04 494.77 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

496.54 509.17 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] and he wasn't even really into the weights or anything he'd just talk on basic exercise you know calisthenics [noise] jumping jacks and that's that stuff you know as you get older that stuff really does make a difference [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

500.26 501.14 B: right 

504.76 506.23 B: exactly 

508.47 513.29 B: oh yeah well especially like um keeping yourself flexible 

511.69 515.06 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

513.47 527.11 B: 'cause uh my dad had a really bad back growing up and one of the things i was really careful about especially when i started lifting weights which is another reason i went to the gym i wanted to make sure there were people around who sh- knew show me how to do the right movement the last thing i wanted to do was 

519.57 521.38 A: (( mhm )) 

521.85 522.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

525.55 527.12 A: mhm 

527.03 528.54 B: screw up my back 

528.28 530.96 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

528.57 537.54 B: but i find that once you get the movement down you really strengthen your muscles and and it's sort of good all over like improving coordination and flexibility 

531.65 532.66 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

534.66 536.26 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

537.45 539.38 A: mhm 

538.19 539.21 B: um 

539.47 547.37 A: wh- what i do find it you definitely need um diversity because if you just [noise] do push-ups and sit-ups 

547.87 560.21 A: for me personally i lose interest interest because [noise] i get bored [noise] but [noise] if i mix it up like now i do push-ups let's say i'll start off on push-ups then i'll lift some weights then i'll do some 

558.80 559.63 B: (( mhm right )) 

560.41 564.84 A: l- lift weights in different position then i'll do some sit-ups but mix it up 

564.47 565.76 B: (( [noise] right )) 

565.64 572.81 A: [noise] [lipsmack] [mn] allows me to maintain interest because every day is interesting you know uh instead of doing push-ups the normal way i'll do it the military style 

572.36 578.85 B: yeah right well the other thing i've really noticed is that by doing exercises in different orders like some days 

574.26 574.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

579.01 585.88 B: whatever i do first of course is usually much easier and as i go along to like the seventh or eighth exercise it gets much more of a challenge 

581.14 582.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

583.71 585.40 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

585.50 586.59 A: mhm 

585.72 599.89 B: so by mixing it up it makes sure that like every every exercise has a chance to sort of be [laughter] be the one that i have the most energy for [noise] um you know at least once every couple of weeks or so and and as you say it it also keeps it interesting 

594.10 595.94 A: mhm 

597.24 598.24 A: (( [noise] mhm ))
