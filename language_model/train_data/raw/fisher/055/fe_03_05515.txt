12.49 22.14 A: oh i'm in l._a. too west side so the topic is uh should children be allowed to read anything 

22.31 27.36 B: uh you know i wish they would've given that to us i'm not exactly sure what it was 

27.15 31.10 A: [laughter] i think they said that uh 

32.08 36.74 A: uh it the topic was the the original topic was censorship and that's 

35.80 37.53 B: yeah that's right 

36.82 39.61 A: then the specific topic i think was uh 

40.35 46.08 A: should uh students maybe it was should students be allowed to read any book 

46.55 51.16 A: i think that's the way they put it they go too fast 

48.83 49.57 B: be 

50.26 54.50 B: it was you know because uh i have been waiting here for 

55.77 56.84 B: (( i don't know )) 

57.81 61.81 B: uh probably a good uh twenty minutes 

62.50 68.21 B: waiting and waiting and all of a sudden it started doing that thing and i was i was trying to pay attention 

62.69 63.38 A: w- 

68.89 75.42 A: isn't that weird 'cause i i just phoned and it was instantaneous this is my second call what what what number number is it for you 

69.06 70.16 B: anyways 

75.15 76.76 B: this is my first call

86.12 87.90 A: yeah i phoned that 

88.03 95.24 A: and uh the first time it was early in the afternoon when i first got up and uh i i thought just you know and then i thought i'd try real late 

95.64 97.40 A: just to see the difference 

97.38 111.51 A: i don't think it matters about the topic i think they're more concerned with our voices that's what the woman i talked to originally said that this is a compu- you know they're they're doing voice analysis to be fed into computers 

112.36 113.61 A: to uh 

113.93 118.66 A: just for regional distinctions and things like that 

119.01 126.71 A: so i think they they just wanna give you a topic just to keep you talking i think they're more concerned with the voices themselves 

126.15 137.05 B: okay well at any rate uh i don't wanna take any chances 'cause i don't want 'em to call me back and say i didn't talk anything about the subject 'cause um i am interested in doing what they what they want but as far as 

130.72 131.87 A: [laughter] 

132.99 133.99 A: right 

135.84 143.37 A: what do you think what do you think about that um that um people you know young people read whatever they want 

143.57 146.01 B: okay now what was the what was the question again 

145.43 156.31 A: i think they were that they s- you know should should i think i don't know if they students or young people but should you know young people or students be allowed to read [mn] whatever they want 

146.96 148.07 B: (( they asked )) 

156.56 159.55 B: [noise] okay um of course not 

159.61 165.63 B: um in the the way i view it is that you know um 

165.70 167.40 B: we as um 

167.86 174.64 B: well i'm not a parent but i mean i think of the parent and what their role is according to what i have 

174.60 185.36 B: been able to understand from the word is that we're supposed to bring up our children in the admonitions of the lord now a lot of people of course have their own views on that but but i mean 

185.31 192.34 B: we need to be good examples we have to you know be able to wanna teach them right from wrong if w- if you have children and i mean 

192.28 200.62 B: you know that just goes without saying and y- and you just there's so much smut and so much things that you know they'll twist the mind they'll 

200.54 207.83 B: of the child and they're too vulnerable for all the the things that are unfitting for them to learn about and you know 

207.59 209.27 A: it's so hard though 

209.68 212.32 A: you is your lord jesus 

213.83 216.25 A: it's so hard to 

216.80 221.92 A: i mean i i don't think children should be allowed to read books on how to build bombs 

221.54 222.56 B: right 

222.07 229.14 A: i don't think they should be allowed to read you know there's a probably a h- a hundred things they shouldn't read about but where do you draw the line 

226.67 227.78 B: truly 

228.99 232.48 B: well um where you draw the line is you know 

231.44 239.70 A: i don't i'm not a parent either [sigh] i'm not a parent either uh b- but i love books i've read i have read thousands of books 

233.20 234.75 B: you're what you're not 

234.90 236.47 B: [noise] okay 

239.36 240.48 B: i believe you 

240.34 246.89 A: and and and i'm i i don't think any of them have hurt me course i've never i'm not interested in satanism [laughter] or 

246.55 248.13 B: of course not no yeah 

247.00 256.83 A: you know i'm just a normal person and and i guess if you weren't a normal person a book could have a bad affect upon you if it were full of evil [sigh] [mn] 

256.20 269.28 B: well yeah well the you know the i just have read that uh you know that children can be influenced you know even sor- you know easily but if there's nothing that's you know constructive about uh hope and the future 

269.22 273.99 B: then you know then they could you know swallow almost anything and and then 

274.01 284.26 B: you know use if for uh evil you know or they could get caught up in uh other people's uh you know pra- pr- you know uh what whatever you wanna call it uh 

284.54 285.57 B: um 

285.81 286.73 B: uh 

286.80 288.10 B: just um 

288.30 289.62 B: you know um 

289.70 293.10 B: if they like you know they might be uh 

294.35 295.40 B: um 

295.46 302.97 B: led into it uh they might be persuaded to try something and then you know hurt somebody else or hurt themselves 

303.77 305.33 A: it's a tough question 

305.60 307.17 A: i mean it really is i mean i m- 

307.36 317.35 A: i love books so much and and like i can think of times when mark twain was censored they didn't want kids to read huckleberry finn you ever read huckleberry finn 

317.02 330.67 B: i remember hearing about it in school and you know i just can't remember that far back i would ha- i would have to believe i read [noise] i read some of it i seem to remember a book and and reading it now i don't know if i read the whole thing i just can't remember that far back 

329.29 335.40 A: they used the n. word constantly in it mark twain used the word but he used it affectionately 

334.65 335.70 B: what word 

335.55 338.71 A: the n. word nigger nigger 

336.92 337.86 B: n 

338.47 339.33 B: oh 

339.11 347.46 A: they used that word throughout the book because uh nigger jim was the [sigh] was the guy that was going down the river with huck 

347.87 353.46 A: and that was just his name and back then in missouri in that day and age 

349.78 350.78 B: (( [lipsmack] oh yeah )) 

353.55 365.78 A: that was the way the word was used i hate the word uh i get in big vicious arguments with my f- certain members of my family that use that word and i say that you're just being ignorant it's an incendiary word 

363.90 364.87 B: that's true true 

365.82 373.60 A: it it just shouldn't be shouldn't it shouldn't be used except among black people love to use it among each other but that's their right 

372.16 372.99 B: yeah 

373.75 375.84 B: yeah i uh 

374.76 376.73 A: it's a tough topic 

376.34 380.91 B: i try to you know let 'em know that i don't i don't i don't like coming you know 

380.70 392.44 B: racially interracially even even amongst themselves i i'll kinda like and just say you know like that's you know that's a shame that you'll say that and but yet some some of of of the blacks explode 

392.27 396.08 B: you know over that word uh said about them and stuff and 

392.35 393.70 A: [laughter] 

395.42 397.76 A: oh well sh- and i don't blame them 

397.22 407.76 B: oh i don't either but i mean still you know for i mean that's why i mean you know it it should be it should be a word that it you know should be you know thrown out of the existence but you know 

406.64 419.40 A: it would be nice if it would become extinct but they're gonna keep it now it's it's the blacks i think more than the whites that are keeping it alive 'cause they use it affectionately i think the blacks are keeping that word alive more than the whites these days 

413.83 414.96 B: how's that again 

418.51 423.00 B: i don't know that's too close a call i don't you know i don't i don't appreciate the word 

421.12 422.79 A: it's hard yeah it's hard 

422.85 425.07 A: i don't either i don't either 

424.59 427.52 B: i i i i can see what you mean on that 

427.53 433.09 B: but um as far as the youth you know um i i'm i feel uh 

433.10 436.07 B: i'm content uh to see that uh 

435.96 445.60 B: that more people are are reaching out from the church and and you know they're wanting to um basically they're trying to uh re educ- re educate the children 

445.47 449.89 B: you know um they're wanting to give them the the the choice and the chance uh 

449.70 461.18 B: to uh to be an active part of uh of uh of the church uh o- of doing uh things when it comes to school and and uh you know like they got 'em involved in this uh 

461.14 462.16 B: (( uh )) 

462.07 476.34 B: in the in the war that was going on as far as like sending cards uh and letters to uh military people and and just you know just these good things that are um allowing them to uh you know to be useful and uh productive and uh 

476.51 486.16 B: and so you know i i just i'm all for uh you know like they wanna uh you know make the classes in school um i i can't remember but they wanted to be able to 

486.05 492.16 B: you know have them you know not too many but not too few and they wanted to have the teachers you know really uh 

492.18 495.01 B: you know look to uh educating them and um 

495.63 498.92 B: and th- them you know just uh to learn and uh 

498.94 501.63 B: and you know that's that's a good thing uh 

502.51 513.65 B: you know there are are they're our future um for however long it is you know that uh it'd be easy you know i don't know what your view is about christ but i believe um 

513.49 520.80 B: by the spirit of truth that that the lord did exist and he does exist he's alive and he's coming back as the word says 

520.91 528.59 B: and so i you know i just um i just that's my hope and uh and i believe it uh and i just you know wanna um 

528.60 539.25 B: you know be a part of you know being loving uh to uh you know a- any man any woman any young man young woman teenage boy teenage girl little boy and little girls but i mean 

539.14 552.61 B: you know they're the ones the little ones you know and teenagers you know they're neglected and and and and shoved aside to where you know they become latch key kids and and uh and and they're suffering because you know 

553.20 556.47 B: the male and female or dad and mom decided uh 

556.25 569.00 B: to make love and and weren't cautious and had a child and then and then they had it and dad threw it off on mom and mom threw it off on dad and the kid suffered and you know and and that's you know not that's not right that's 

568.83 580.72 B: you know not the way it should be you know there should be you know they should be given the time and then the and the opportunity to be brought up and and given the chance to have a productive life and you know that's why i don't believe that we sh- could just you know
