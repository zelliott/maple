10.15 11.33 B: ah 

11.45 14.09 B: how did you find out about september eleventh 

13.99 18.08 A: um i actually i'm not normally awake at the hour that it occurred but ah 

18.10 28.49 A: i had woken up for who knows what reason and ah i keep a computer next to my bed i'm kind of geeky in that regard and there was an instant message from a friend saying turn on the television now 

24.75 25.67 B: mhm 

28.56 35.49 A: and i don't even keep a television hooked up because ah i had a housemate at that time who was very not into 

35.47 45.91 A: into making everyone pay for cables that a television hooked up so i went and i hooked up a television and i turned it on a- and right they were just s- they had just s- um 

38.27 39.08 B: mhm 

45.86 51.16 A: the the plane had just hit the second tower and everything was showing live feeds and it was 

51.63 53.86 A: very dramatic [laughter] 

54.67 57.28 B: d- and where are you geographically 

57.12 59.34 A: um upstate new york 

58.76 60.30 B: oh okay 

59.97 61.87 A: yeah i it it was ah e- 

63.36 67.34 A: most of my family's in the city so it's it was interesting [laughter] 

67.61 70.13 B: and had you known people who had worked 

70.43 71.36 A: um 

70.51 71.99 B: in that area 

71.41 77.92 A: i i knew people a lotta people who worked in the city i didn't know whether specifically any of the people i knew worked there um what about you 

76.45 77.24 B: mhm 

78.15 81.95 B: (( ah well i'm i'm in ah downtown brooklyn )) 

81.87 84.36 A: oh so you must've been m- 

83.86 85.36 B: yes [laughter] 

85.48 89.99 B: quite quite physically close and ah 

90.59 101.12 B: quite directly affected in a lotta ways if for no other reason than we got all the the smoke and and debris for weeks and weeks afterwards 

101.21 106.65 A: [laughter] did y- did you know anyone who was working there or was not working there 

106.02 117.30 B: amazingly ah not i i i know a number of people who had stories of of getting to w- going leaving for work late because of ah voting 

117.03 118.00 A: (( mm )) 

117.45 124.99 B: ah and things like that and so i know a number of people who were very very lucky not to have been there who worked right there so 

125.18 127.04 B: it's pretty 

128.08 131.48 B: [mn] astonishing stuff the way fate ah works 

131.12 133.05 A: better than the alternative 

132.35 140.00 B: yeah but in upstate new york where you are a- have you seen any changes are far as like security measures or anything like that since 

139.01 144.50 A: um i don't know about upstate new york as a whole but where i am yes because i'm at rensselaer polytechnic 

144.06 144.99 B: uh-huh 

144.48 154.70 A: which is a ah research institution that does ah i mean we're we're a college but we do a lot of ah we have a lot of military contracts in our research so we locked down that day i mean 

151.61 152.59 B: mhm 

154.83 160.51 A: w- we were there was like a call went out do not come to class campus is closed do not go onto campus 

161.15 166.24 A: and they were very they were very adamant they didn't 

166.29 180.20 A: they there there was a blood drive scheduled for that day so they were like you you know come onto campus do the blood drive if you want th- that's what i ended up doing because it it was something that i could do that felt vaguely useful but 

169.66 170.46 B: mhm 

178.13 178.98 B: mhm 

180.39 184.14 A: th- they they locked down the campus so that was that was our big 

184.91 195.52 A: big thing and up here a lot of things have a taken a you know have sort of used it as a pretense for security that seems to serve other purposes but oh like our movie theaters ah 

192.72 194.31 B: like like what 

195.58 202.57 A: immediately afterwards now you suddenly can't bring ah your your purse in or your backpack or whatever because 

202.88 209.31 A: i i have no idea what they're hoping to stop i mean presumably they think people are going to try to smuggle bombs into movie theaters 

209.22 220.83 A: but i think it's just another way to ah try and make it more inconvenient for people to bring in food they're still doing that although it i think that policy is never going away i think they they had the excuse to implement it and as such 

213.36 215.07 B: th- they're still doing that 

221.68 229.17 A: you know implemented it during the the time when a lot of a lot of meaningful policies were being implemented and left that one there 

228.56 233.31 B: have other other kinds of places other than movie theaters also s- done that too 

233.07 237.80 A: um not that i'm aware of how about i mean down there i presume they're somewhat more 

238.11 246.55 B: ah well obviously you know the airports are are really really really big on security these days other than that ah 

238.89 240.16 A: significant [noise] 

246.65 250.20 B: the the local libraries had been very 

251.19 252.53 B: rigorous a- 

253.22 256.47 B: in the initial stages i think in particular because 

256.68 260.81 B: th- you know there were some bomb threats received by the local libraries 

260.86 265.26 B: and also people tend to do you know carry a lot of you know 

265.64 280.46 B: ah you know s- knapsacks and things like that into libraries they've sort of decreased their alertness but they still do wanna do a quick ah look see if you're carrying something especially if it's bulky 

278.97 281.94 A: mhm 

280.61 284.27 B: and seems like it might have a lotta heavy stuff in it 

284.33 296.76 B: o- other than that we we do have the the national guard ah put in appearances at various subway stations and what they do is they have these guys in the camouflage suits 

296.75 300.06 B: with the m. sixteen rifles at the ready 

299.64 301.29 A: (( mm whoa )) 

300.09 303.74 B: which is sort of scary i don't know if you get any of that at all up b- where you are 

303.14 308.41 A: we we don't get any of that at all that where i mean up here there's very 

308.42 312.50 A: e- there's more talk than actual security presence 

312.25 322.01 B: well when you see three or four guys and they're always in groups there's never just one you see three or four guys and they're usually also big guys [laughter] with ah with these ah you know with their a- 

317.82 320.53 A: mhm 

321.77 336.53 B: you know they're basic- they're automatic rifles they're they're army weapons they're not weapons that you see in a civilian area not not in the united states or n- you never used to see it so that's that's unsettling i've sort of gotten used to it 

336.76 338.55 B: ah and the other thing is 

338.59 343.73 B: police you'll get a heavier police presence so like at my local subway station 

344.07 356.11 B: we'll see six or eight police [laughter] yeah all grouped together for no particular reason you know they're just maintaining a a presence i guess to s- scare off would be ah 

356.41 361.06 B: you know whatever's ah and that is a funny feeling 

356.90 359.47 A: mhm 

360.69 369.91 A: [laughter] yeah w- i can [laughter] certainly see that i mean we we have a very minor the campus itself hasn't increased security presence i mean there are 

370.16 380.65 A: security guards but they're basically rent a cops around very just sort of random patrols sitting watching people entering parking lots 

373.17 374.84 B: mhm 

381.10 387.66 B: do they do anything like target ah people of specific ah you know ethnicities or mm 

387.19 399.02 A: um not that i've seen and e- i mean in my experience i don't think it would be stood for well here we're we're a research institution which means ah at least in my experience we have a very disproportionately ah 

399.26 404.28 A: i would i guess i would say indian population from you know the indian subcontinent um 

404.55 417.23 A: and so to have to really go after people who seem to be ethnically from that area would be asinine to something like thirty five percent of the student body is probably from that area 

412.44 413.41 B: mhm 

416.54 417.42 B: wow 

417.35 427.00 A: though there was i mean in the immediate days following there was a little bit of racial tension but it went away very quickly 

426.45 428.71 B: in w- in what way racial tension 

427.68 428.52 A: oh 

429.00 436.51 A: ah harassing comments made um i think two professors got into a fight over the fact that one of the professors is 

436.74 439.45 A: ah h- i don't even know exactly i mean 

439.87 445.82 A: one of the professors belongs t- to some ethnic group that the other professor presumably 

446.06 455.96 A: had something against i didn't really follow all the details but it resulted in some in one of the professors being asked basically to ah the 

456.48 463.08 A: the professor who made the comment's being asked to make his already partial retirement much less partial 

462.71 463.64 B: huh 

463.11 464.95 A: and the other professor ah 

465.48 470.25 A: being very uncomfortable for a while and considering leaving the school but is ultimately staying 

471.48 472.34 A: so 

471.54 475.48 B: that's that's that's pretty ah [laughter] heavy duty stuff 

473.81 475.49 A: [laughter] 

475.88 477.82 A: well i mean that's 

478.33 484.93 A: that's really the only backlash we got up here so i mean we're getting none of the national guard [laughter] stuff up here so 

483.79 488.43 B: [laughter] how about otherwise in your personal life has it you know caused you to make any kinda changes or 

488.58 489.50 A: um 

490.42 493.14 A: that's hard to say i mean 

493.53 500.96 A: it it caused me to consider when my current you know to consider my current my current job my current research is 

501.33 508.05 A: an offshoot of of the attacks it's i'm i'm doing research that's related now to some of the 

508.52 521.98 A: the anti terrorist profiling so and i mean that wouldn't exist without it but at the same time i don't think anything that i'm that i pers- you know any of the chances i make where i choose to go i- it's not like i stay off planes now or anything 

510.76 511.66 B: mhm 

521.12 527.20 B: mhm but the that profiling is something you wouldn't have been doing if there hadn't been a september eleventh a- 

526.66 535.41 A: th- i i doubt that the government would've pushed it through so quickly and gotten it out to research institutions like we are quite as quickly if we were 

535.13 537.36 B: and what what particular field are you in 

537.28 540.65 A: ah i'm in cognitive science so i do computer a. i. 

539.47 541.68 B: mhm mhm 

541.39 543.33 A: ah h- how about by you i mean 

543.23 547.58 B: ah well the s- [laughter] some some very 

544.55 548.33 A: mhm 

548.25 562.01 B: inevitable lifestyle changes for example i used to go down to that area because they had for example borders which is a very popular y- large chain of bookstores they had one of their flagship stores 

561.28 563.62 A: i've i've actually been in that store my 

562.77 570.39 B: yeah okay so you know it it's a sort of a nice place to hang out with a that used to they used to have a little ah coffee bar upstairs 

563.92 565.84 A: so yeah 

569.62 571.42 A: mhm 

570.47 579.48 B: and a lot of places where people could just lounge around and y- you know read books or even listen to some of the music tapes ah and that's totally gone 

579.98 590.85 B: and it is it is a real loss as are some of the events that they used to hold outdoors they would have music ah and dance ah concerts during the summers 

590.90 599.89 B: and it's just all gone i actually had gone one [laughter] a couple of months before i had actually gone on a date at ah down there and we wandered arou- 

592.46 593.43 A: mhm
