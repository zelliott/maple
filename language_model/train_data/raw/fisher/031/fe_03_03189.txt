200.37 201.80 B: that's great 

201.48 209.54 A: to cut their hair and like their hair gets really matty if you don't brush it every day so it's kind of a pain so you've got to brush their hair like every day pretty much 

209.52 223.48 A: or else like they just turn into a big furball and you have to shave everything off [laughter] like it it's kinda harsh um i don't really spend too much time doing that may parents kinda it's their dog so you know they take care of it i just kinda play with it every once in a while 

223.41 227.21 B: do you take is it a a a male or a female 

227.01 229.35 A: uh it's a female yeah 

228.49 230.51 B: do you take her out for walks or 

230.65 242.80 A: uh i take it out for a walk sometimes i really don't take it too far we live in like kinda of a isolated block area so it's like you know we don't take her too far she like usually just goes outside to like go to the bathroom or something she's really a house dog so 

243.08 245.11 B: oh yeah she goes in the yard or 

245.71 250.46 A: we live in a wooded area there's a lot of you know we don't want her to get too many ticks or something like that so 

250.15 251.36 B: oh right 

250.52 260.23 A: we don't let her out in the yard too much we let her out in the deck and stuff like that we let her outside but you know we don't really let her [laughter] run around in the woods 'cause that wouldn't be cool 

261.04 263.54 B: my cats stay inside um 

261.26 262.06 A: (( oh okay )) 

263.89 267.28 B: i live in an apartment so i have a little 

267.86 270.76 B: sort of a roof that goes out um 

271.54 273.49 B: out from one of my windows 

273.74 278.22 B: so i let them out on that that's its i guess it's like a deck you could consider it a 

278.09 279.11 A: [laughter] 

278.34 291.39 B: sort of like a deck a city it's a city deck and um they go out on there but that's it they don't go outside it's the same um concern like fleas and ticks and 

279.46 280.61 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

290.73 291.59 A: uh-huh 

291.50 292.95 B: getting into fights

293.48 294.57 B: or 

298.43 301.57 B: no no i probably should though 

301.22 302.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

302.33 305.28 B: 'cause they climb on everything else [laughter] 

303.92 315.82 A: ca- yeah i don't know my friend's cats they just like jump like from the floor to like the top of the dinette set it's probably about eight feet high i'm like jesus [laughter] pretty agile 

314.22 315.42 B: [laughter] 

315.87 317.49 A: (( oh it's good [mn] )) 

315.97 319.56 B: yeah they can jump really high they it's amazing 

319.28 323.86 A: yeah my dog's pretty useful sometimes [laughter] it can jump like 

324.04 327.04 A: a foot in the air i guess maybe she's 

327.68 332.63 A: yeah she's not too not too athletic [laughter] she runs around a lot though she's pretty happy 

332.19 334.97 B: are those the kind of dogs they use in the circus 

335.12 341.48 A: uh it's it's yes it's uh usually a show dog like if they're bred for that 'cause you know they 

341.94 346.07 A: they usually grow their hair out so they look really you know exotic and cute or whatever 

345.59 349.02 B: and they put the bows the little bow on yeah 

346.66 348.22 A: (( yeah the bows )) 

348.03 362.32 A: yeah they look they look like walking rugs but my dog uh we we cut its hair pretty short so it looks more like a yorkie than anything else like it's got really short scruffy hair and yeah it's just a lot easier to take care of that way too 'cause oh we've had long hair and my god [laughter] 

361.58 363.75 B: they get the matts and everything right 

363.25 366.60 A: yeah it it would be really hard to take care of it if it had long hair 

366.83 369.67 A: so we just kind of keep it short so it's not too much 

369.00 371.65 B: i've heard those matts can be painful too 

371.45 375.29 A: yeah like if they matt up it's it's not good for the dog so 

372.68 373.37 B: that's 

375.15 380.93 B: and starts pulling at at the the skin even so it 

378.11 390.50 A: yeah yeah that's what we try and yeah we try and brush her as much as we can and keep it shorter so it doesn't matt up you know but it does anyway 'cause it just matts up so easily so you know we just try and keep it from matting up as much as we can 

390.75 393.69 A: if it does we just cut it off [laughter] you know no big deal 

394.51 395.34 A: i 

394.54 396.78 B: so do you enjoy having a dog 

397.52 411.24 A: [noise] hey what's up [laughter] um [laughter] sorry um i guess so i mean it's it's pretty cool like i'd rather have a dog than a cat i guess 'cause i'm not much of a cat person so like do do your cats like throw up a lot i guess or 

410.65 412.63 B: (( [laughter] )) 

411.51 413.48 A: like you know the hairball thing or 

413.63 418.37 B: well if i if i brush them they don't but if i if i 

416.85 417.86 A: (( oh okay )) 

418.39 424.47 B: slack off on the brushing they end up they'll get the hairballs but um 

420.02 421.11 A: oh 

421.67 422.36 A: (( [laughter] )) 

424.49 434.68 B: yeah that's that's kind of a rep that cats have [laughter] throwing up throwing up hairballs a lot actually it's been it's been quite a while since i've seen one 

430.51 432.13 A: yeah yeah

442.79 449.06 B: i do i clip their nails um i just clipped them yesterday i i brushed them and clipped their nails 

449.13 455.90 B: and that can be [laughter] kind of difficult depending on the cat but 

453.37 454.28 A: [laughter] 

454.59 455.91 A: (( yeah i bet [mn] )) 

456.50 463.33 B: [noise] i've got these um these cats are finally starting to get used to it so it's like i just

471.75 472.87 B: but 

472.99 474.19 B: um 

474.22 476.65 B: it took a while for them to get used to it 

476.31 477.48 A: (( wow [laughter] ))
