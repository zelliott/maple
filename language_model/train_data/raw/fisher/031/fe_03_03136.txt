380.07 381.00 A: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

381.38 383.83 B: so does your dog get ticks a lot or something 

383.82 393.01 A: n- not so much i mean now that it's getting to be the you know it's mid spring almost to the summer yeah it gets a little more dangerous with ticks and fleas too 

390.72 391.37 B: (( yeah )) 

392.78 395.76 B: my dog goes crazy when she gets a tick 

395.65 402.92 A: yeah ticks are terrible i mean and sometimes we don't you know we try to check him but yeah i mean your dog sounds like it's pretty furry too right 

397.30 398.13 B: yeah 

402.32 403.88 B: yeah 

403.04 404.75 A: do you keep her do you keep her 

404.90 407.94 A: hair long or medium or short or how do you do 

408.15 409.55 B: um sometimes 

409.59 415.72 B: we just make it kind of long sometimes well it's pretty much like medium hair [mn] it's not like dragging to the ground 

413.68 414.57 A: (( it )) 

415.36 416.31 A: right 

415.86 419.20 B: it's brushed [mn] nice and 

418.37 427.69 A: yeah because it's the longer the hair i mean i know we we kind of do the same thing we'll get oliver cut very short and then it's wh- which we like to do in the summer so we can see the ticks but 

427.77 429.76 A: [lipsmack] he hates getting groomed so 

430.33 440.88 A: [lipsmack] and i- i- you know it's hard to get him in and last year we found a couple you know one of 'em was was all totally full it was really bad and we had missed it because it was in his inside of his ear 

440.98 441.74 B: wow 

441.71 452.48 A: yeah it's really and and fleas can be a problem too so we we use the i don't know one of those treatments whatever it is to to keep them from getting ticks and fleas 

452.80 459.05 A: i think it goes on once a month or s- it's just um it's absorbed through his skin and it works pretty well so [mn] 

459.07 462.08 A: so that's good does your dog do any tricks 

462.00 462.83 B: um 

462.10 463.29 A: pepe right 

463.15 466.54 B: well i mean when we tell her to roll over she rolls over but that's all [mn] 

466.39 469.11 A: that's all does she does she come when you call her 

469.06 470.59 B: (( yeah she comes when i call her and she )) 

471.00 473.70 B: she doesn't really do that much stuff she just like 

473.93 475.45 B: she doesn't bark or anything 

475.46 478.27 A: well that's good does she does she ah 

478.93 482.80 A: get on the furniture do you have a problem with that or does she know to stay off of the furniture oh that's 

482.07 485.86 B: she knows to stay off the furniture she got told that when she was a puppy 

485.49 491.13 A: good oh at least she listens 'cause i mean oliver does but we'll come in and he'll be on the couch 

490.91 491.60 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

491.43 495.61 A: he would never go on it while we're here but if we come in we'll either hear him jumping off 

495.70 500.31 A: or because he knows he's not supposed to be there or he'll still be there if he's asleep 

500.24 501.35 B: [laughter] 

500.92 505.28 A: he knows better but he still does it he kinda gets his little rebellion 

503.97 504.53 B: (( [mn] )) 

505.29 507.26 B: (( yeah )) 

505.98 507.46 A: where he will ah 

507.52 509.75 A: he does that and he'll ah 

510.37 516.60 A: he he will get into cupboards too if he if there's something that he wants if he 'cause he knows where his treats are 

516.47 525.92 A: 'cause the cupboards are not we don't they're not locked so he can nudge 'em with his nose and he gets in and sometimes we'll find the bag knocked over oh she does too yeah 

522.62 523.97 B: that's what my dog does 

524.07 524.76 B: [laughter] 

525.32 526.72 B: yeah 

526.07 531.85 A: they're pretty smart i mean i guess you know some dogs are smarter than others but yeah th- th- i think it's pretty smart to do that 

531.61 532.64 B: (( yeah )) 

532.31 540.10 A: to figure out how to get a door open or something or even when they know they're not to do they're not supposed to do something so they wait until nobody's looking to do it 

540.51 541.09 B: (( mm )) 

540.69 542.21 A: that's kinda sneaky 

542.20 542.90 B: (( [mn] )) 

543.15 546.19 B: does your dog get along with other dogs well 

545.55 558.48 A: yeah he gets along pretty well i mean we had another dog here for a little while and he's actually we were surprised that he was a bully he he we had a miniature pincher here for about three weeks and he would really bully that dog but 

558.35 564.28 A: he likes bigger dogs he really doesn't like dogs the same size or smaller he likes big dogs he plays 

563.08 566.64 B: [mn] my dog kinda beats up little dogs too [mn] yeah
