210.81 213.82 A: they always make me feel better when i don't feel good 

213.83 224.81 B: yeah that's they like um actually recorded that like actual scientific studies on if you have um like pets around it lowers your like um 

225.30 229.37 B: like heart rate and calms you down and stuff like that so 

226.50 227.67 A: right 

228.51 233.95 A: right i've been thinking about getting some fish they say that watching fish is very calming 

229.44 230.73 B: yeah but i guess 

234.17 235.88 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

235.32 239.99 A: one of my sons has salt water fish and they're so pretty but they're expensive to maintain 

239.87 241.31 B: yeah definitely i 

241.57 247.00 B: think the tank can get gunky and it's just a pain to clean the tank and everything like that 

244.96 245.96 A: right 

246.38 247.43 A: right 

247.30 248.25 B: yeah 

247.69 255.20 A: yeah they they spend a lot maintaining the silly tank but they are very calming to watch and they're so pretty 

255.11 256.18 B: yeah 

255.50 259.11 A: my daughter in law has some in her insurance office in oklahoma 

259.19 260.33 B: oh wow are 

259.36 266.78 A: it's nice but they have ah they have somebody that comes in takes care of them twice a week or three times a week yeah so that's not too bad 

265.65 267.73 B: you from the south or 

267.11 268.78 A: well i'm from kansas 

268.72 270.41 B: oh okay cool 

269.69 270.73 A: where are you 

270.92 272.48 B: (( i'm in new york city )) 

272.18 273.62 A: new york city 

273.26 274.41 B: yeah 

273.95 276.16 A: that would make it harder to have an animal 

275.92 282.54 B: yes yes although a lot of you'd be surprised because um like dogs and cats and they dress them up and walk around 

282.15 283.25 A: [laughter] 

283.34 287.63 A: yeah but i'm not a big one to go cleaning up the little piles that they leave behind but 

286.39 288.57 B: yeah absolutely not 

287.77 290.10 A: you have to do that i know in the city 

289.82 291.25 B: yeah 

290.70 302.15 A: mine just go out the back door we have a dog door in the back door and they just come and go all the time we do have to keep the door locked most of the time because the babies will go out the door too and that's not real good 

293.91 295.32 B: oh that's cute 

302.17 303.01 B: no 

302.19 305.10 A: they escape through the dog door [laughter] 

305.71 307.14 B: so wa- you have 

307.23 309.12 B: (( little kids in your house too )) 

308.80 314.41 A: um my oldest son and my youngest daughter each have babies the same age so i keep them every day 

313.12 313.97 B: (( oh okay )) 

314.68 315.89 B: (( oh wow )) 

315.12 325.32 A: i think it's good for children to grow up with animals so i think it's really good to have the pets around it says that they lower their their um incidence of allergies if they're raised with animals 

320.05 321.22 B: yeah 

325.51 328.89 B: oh true yeah probably because you're exposed to a lot of things 

328.59 329.52 A: (( so ah )) 

329.73 334.16 A: and animals do love the babies and take good care of protecting them for me 

334.20 335.16 B: yeah 

334.61 336.48 A: so that's nice 

337.00 337.88 B: (( that's nice )) 

337.49 340.65 A: so do you think eventually you'll get another you'll get an animal 

340.42 342.58 B: oh yeah definitely um 

342.82 353.66 B: the reason we don't have pets in my house now is because my parents don't want to take care like my house at home not my apartment in new york city i'm originally from new jersey which is you know [laughter] 

350.34 351.15 A: uh-huh 

353.08 354.13 A: (( mhm )) 

354.04 355.77 B: pretty close so 

355.10 355.89 A: right 

355.99 359.37 B: after the second dog that we had died they just didn't want 

359.48 367.32 B: to want the responsibility but when i eventually have a you know a house of my own i think i'll definitely and i'm out of the city i think i'll definitely have 

367.20 370.47 A: yeah yeah i think animals belong out of the city it's 

371.11 373.09 A: so hard to have them in the city 

371.36 372.00 B: (( pets )) 

372.97 374.27 B: yeah definitely 

373.73 378.75 A: and although we live in a city but it's just nothing like a fast city [laughter] 

378.04 379.68 B: yeah [laughter] 

379.00 380.97 A: right right 

381.36 382.33 A: so 

383.92 389.84 A: anyway what else are we supposed to mention um how much time we spend with each pet and something else 

386.54 387.80 B: (( i don't know )) 

390.30 394.62 A: and something else she told me was how much time we spend with the pet and something else 

393.84 403.04 B: oh yeah so since i've had my aloe plant um i feed it i don't know i see it every day and it's kind of lopsided now i have to change it's ah 

403.39 409.00 B: the bucket it's in but when i did have a dog i spent like a pretty good time 

409.11 411.17 B: with it a day how about you 

411.57 418.31 A: yeah they're always on my lap or under my feet they sleep they sleep under my desk when i'm working on the computer and 

418.43 423.19 A: on the couch when i'm sitting on the couch and one of them even sleeps on top of me at night 

423.08 424.25 B: oh 

424.53 426.06 B: a dog or a cat 

425.72 428.83 A: it's a dog but she's more like a cat she's ah 

429.13 433.40 A: just a sweet little thing and she sleeps on top of me when i lay down 

431.09 431.89 B: yeah

438.74 442.77 A: oh my gosh my one cat i have an exchange student all the time and 

442.83 449.03 A: when we get the exchange student she always brings a a dead animal and leaves it by the bedroom door almost every night

448.90 450.41 B: [laughter] 

449.65 454.16 A: i have to be sure and get up in the morning first thing and check and make sure that it's gone 

454.36 455.75 B: mhm 

454.46 460.48 A: yeah they're definitely trying to teach us how to how to fend for yourselves we don't do very good about it but 

460.15 461.29 B: yeah 

460.77 464.98 A: but um they do try to feed us did you have that too when you were younger 

464.99 467.91 B: um i never had a cat but 

467.08 468.05 A: oh 

468.25 476.61 B: um when i was just in my friend's apartment the other day um like her cat came through with like a little mouse and i was like oh does 

477.18 482.00 B: (( your cat have a mouse and my friend goes oh yeah yeah it's a a ))

490.64 494.68 A: they bring in ah birds and mice and 

495.23 505.43 A: anything else that they can find that you know to help us eat but [laughter] and then when they figure we've eaten enough of the dead ones then they start bringing in ones that are half alive 

505.58 506.82 B: oh really 

505.95 509.52 A: so we can catch them i guess i don't know but [laughter] 

509.95 515.69 A: it's always such a shock when you find one they cry out little bunnies and i hear them crying and 

516.08 523.50 A: but they're very they're very good at feeding us it's so sweet of them you know but i have one cat that sleeps that lives outside and one inside so

531.33 533.44 A: but um yeah it'll 

533.46 537.57 A: sure be lonely when the cats and dogs are gone but we're not going to replace them this time 

537.51 541.15 B: yeah so do they all get along pretty much with each other 

541.10 550.95 A: um the inside ones get along great together and the one that's outside is because she doesn't get along with the others we used to have um she was a set there was a male cat that was her 

546.58 547.57 B: mhm 

550.83 557.27 A: was her friend and when he died she moved outside yeah i think he protected her from the ones that are in the house 

554.40 555.24 B: oh 

557.48 558.31 B: (( okay )) 

558.41 562.78 A: so when she when he died she moved outside and won't come in the house now so

565.61 575.12 A: anyway they're nice to have around they're a lot of company and i always know when somebody's coming close to the house so i don't worry about strangers walking in because the dogs go crazy 

575.08 576.68 B: yeah yeah that's 

577.06 579.31 B: so i guess they're pretty good guard dogs 

577.18 577.94 A: i
