68.69 72.71 B: you want me to tell you about rocky and his ah how we ended up with him 

72.61 73.66 A: sure 

73.23 74.84 B: (( okay ah )) 

75.25 79.96 B: we live in a suburban neighborhood ah we have a 

80.49 86.40 B: um a shed that's a- attached to our garage and and he was out there he looked 

86.54 92.75 B: i don't know how old he is because we we really don't know he ended up um 

93.55 102.56 B: at the back door and he was in a state of terror his hair was coming out in clumps as as someone would on chemo- 

103.20 113.52 B: and obviously had been either abandoned abused or i i we really don't know what happened to him so we can only um guess as to his origin 

113.60 114.71 A: wow 

113.88 128.23 B: so we he slept in the shed um it was prior to the winter and there were some blankets and we had some things for the cats in case we weren't home that they can go in and and get shelter 

128.57 134.14 B: we i started leaving food outside ah in the shed for him 

134.15 139.52 B: also one of those um ah nutritional supplements the milk supplements 

139.29 141.34 A: yeah 

139.87 148.91 B: and did that for about six weeks and finally he started to put some weight on and um his hair started coming back but he was still 

149.02 150.94 B: you know crazy as a loon 

150.87 151.81 A: [laughter] 

152.05 157.82 B: um you know we continued doing this and the weather started getting colder ah 

157.92 162.99 B: what we did is we ah got the vet gave us a um 

162.98 177.57 B: a trap and we started putting the food closer and closer to the trap [noise] until finally he ate the food and went inside ah we took him to the vet he cleaned him up gave him some shots 

168.14 169.01 A: uh-huh 

177.58 178.76 B: and 

178.97 188.98 B: we continued feeding him outside the weather got brutally bad um he saw a second cat coming into the house this has to be six seven years ago 

189.53 196.96 B: and he started to come in ah we kept him in the house and then he would go out during the day and come in at night 

197.45 198.49 B: um 

198.78 213.36 B: he- he's really is a very nice he's a very gentle cat but he's just terrified at the slightest bit of noise um the slightest change in the environment people that are here that he's never seen before 

210.12 211.52 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

213.33 218.15 B: so i think he's had an additional six or seven years of um 

218.25 219.67 B: a life span 

219.75 232.15 B: um that's fairly healthy we take him in for his shots now it this is may so around april he went back outside and he's outside and will be out there probably 

232.23 242.60 B: you know comes to eat and then runs outside um this will probably continue until december till the weather gets bad and will start the whole thing again 

242.80 244.03 A: wow 

244.17 246.96 B: so that's where we are with our pets where are you from

259.04 264.03 A: um ended up with a baby that was allergic to cats 

264.12 269.26 A: so they wanted to find a good home and we had moved here from washington state so we said 

268.19 269.06 B: mhm 

269.07 280.68 A: you know we were looking for a cat and they gave us her the cat with everything you know the the carrier the clawing post everything and it took her

286.18 293.93 A: yeah well she was an indoor cat but i have young children and and they don't leave doors closed [laughter] 

292.76 295.08 B: okay so now she's an in and out 

294.52 304.50 A: she's an in and out and she does really good she has we have a back yard that's totally fenced in and so she basically stays in our yard she doesn't go out of our yard 

299.59 300.70 B: oh okay 

304.69 315.07 A: and um she's the queen of our yard let me tell ya she it took her forever to trust us though because she did not know why mommy and daddy were leaving her 

315.29 325.34 A: and it took her she'd come out and she'd eat and she'd go back and hide underneath the table in the corner and it took her probably about a month and a half before she 

325.33 330.58 A: in the middle of the night i was laying there and all of a sudden she showed up on my bed on top of me 

326.41 330.28 B: mhm [noise] really 

330.67 331.52 B: okay 

330.90 333.52 A: now she was purring and i'm going 

332.90 334.07 B: yeah 

333.67 335.25 A: phew we made it 

335.33 342.86 A: and then at christmas time we went home and um i said we got her last just before summer last year 

342.91 346.50 A: and then at christmas time we went home and my um 

347.04 352.99 A: oldest daughter who doesn't live with us took us in to see a petting zoo at a pet shop 

353.14 358.53 A: and they also have some really outrageous animals there like monkeys and stuff 

355.03 356.75 B: (( what did )) 

358.65 370.55 A: and so we went in and there was this little month and a half two month old puppy in there and they're going you know he's not gonna get very big he's a cocker lab but you know he's 

370.56 374.53 A: small cocker small lab he's not gonna get very big 

374.76 381.46 A: and ah i said no i'm not paying money for a dog so i can drive across two states to take him home 

381.57 384.59 A: we'll just go get a dog in m- in california 

384.82 387.13 A: and they put him back away 

387.19 393.55 A: and my little six year old went up to the window and just started crying i mean she was crying 

390.30 392.56 B: (( it )) 

394.12 399.22 A: and she put her hand on the window as if to say you know i'm here 

399.47 404.94 A: and he went over and put his paw up on her hand as if to comfort her 

405.75 406.86 A: well 

406.99 416.51 A: i was taken back at that point you can't not take the puppy home at that point 'cause he's obviously bonded with that child with the few short minutes he's she's held him 

416.94 420.38 A: and so we went ahead and bought him and we brought him home and my 

419.58 420.69 B: (( cost ya ))

427.22 429.13 A: cat was not happy 

428.96 429.98 B: i bet 

430.01 437.32 A: she was very upset but you know she keeps him in his place he's gotten a little quite a bit bigger than her now 

437.35 443.42 A: and he's six month old and he's fairly large and [laughter] 

441.45 444.17 B: and they told you he was gonna be a midget 

443.68 452.55 A: they told us he was gonna be a lap dog well i'd like to see the person whose lap this dog would fit i'm [laughter] and of course he had small paws 

447.76 448.95 B: yeah sure 

452.82 455.46 A: and they he outgrew his paws big time 

455.57 461.19 A: but um him and her actually will cuddle up and sleep now once in a while 

461.23 463.70 A: an- she still hisses for good measure 

463.89 468.24 A: and he loves to chase her today i caught him trying to nip at her tail 

468.50 473.35 A: and you know and all he wants to do is get her to pay attention to him so she'll run after him 

473.81 479.14 A: and ah but he's you know cute dog real he's all black

542.45 545.99 B: um one one of the problems that we're encountering 

546.21 552.82 B: with the cats is that we had some carpeting put down in the basement which is where the the litter box
