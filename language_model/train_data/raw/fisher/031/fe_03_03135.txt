125.00 127.71 A: as l- as l- as long as she knows its out 

127.16 130.65 B: right we feed it small birds that we catch in a cage 

130.79 133.48 A: how how big of a tarantula is it 

132.92 139.55 B: it's about um the size of a human size hand like a big guy's hand 

139.05 143.16 A: okay i was i was waiting for that sentence to end the first word was human 

139.59 140.51 B: my hand 

143.09 143.99 B: (( yeah )) 

143.54 145.16 A: not the size of a human 

144.98 149.05 B: [mn] yeah like we're goats [mn] we're goats that take care of a tarantula 

147.05 147.95 A: yeah 

148.80 150.12 A: [laughter] 

150.13 151.53 B: yeah so 

151.72 153.75 A: what kind of birds do you catch 

153.69 157.74 B: oh small wrens you know it can't really be like pigeon size 

157.50 158.40 A: right 

158.07 165.72 B: so sometimes we'll get a chickadee sometimes we'll get a blue jay but you know those are kinda big and you hardly see blue jays so you know 

163.65 164.47 A: yeah 

165.86 167.82 B: we wouldn't feed it to a tarantula 

167.83 169.11 A: yeah 

168.79 175.03 B: yeah it's ah i think it's from bolivia i forget i did a research report on it when i was smaller 

174.70 176.54 A: mhm 

175.40 178.26 B: but now we just you know it's the tarantula 

178.57 182.82 A: did you just find it or did you buy it at a pet store or 

182.59 193.67 B: ah my uncle mailed it to us i don't know how it lived that long in in the postal service but 'cause my uncle travels a lot he tried sending us a goat but they wouldn't let us 

186.64 187.84 A: [laughter] 

193.48 194.78 A: [laughter] 

194.37 195.48 B: take it 

195.63 196.78 A: yeah that's 

197.06 202.51 A: that would probably be bad if you got home one day and it was just in a crate on your doorstep or something 

201.65 206.16 B: yeah we gave it to a nice haitian couple they said they would take care of it 

205.59 206.97 A: mhm 

206.21 210.06 B: and then they were rich the next day so i guess they were into voodoo or something 

209.57 211.85 A: (( [laughter] )) 

211.83 212.71 B: um 

214.17 217.88 B: so wow how long how how long has it been 

219.18 226.48 A: that oh that we've been on the phone oh a few minutes it always when i did this last time it was ten minutes seemed overly long 

225.38 227.19 B: ten minutes straight 

226.80 228.21 A: what's that 

227.65 229.78 B: it was ten minutes straight 

229.24 235.33 A: yeah yeah just the one topic i- it seemed a little too long last time too though [laughter] 

230.54 231.54 B: interesting 

235.17 237.02 B: mm um 

237.73 239.34 B: (( ah i don't know )) 

239.71 245.68 B: i i think if we trained our tarantula we we could probably teach it to take on kittens but not cats do 

244.49 246.73 A: [laughter] 

246.08 247.96 B: you take in kittens or cats 

247.76 253.32 A: ah we h- mostly have cats we're not home enough to take care of a kitten i don't think 

252.84 257.22 B: ah do you ever get like a juvenile delinquent cat 

256.60 261.69 A: we we have that was our first cat and right now we have a senior delinquent 

261.11 261.94 B: wow 

261.74 262.65 A: so 

263.27 266.87 A: this new delinquent just shits wherever she wants 

266.77 267.69 B: (( whoa )) 

267.61 271.65 A: and the juvenile delinquent bit us all the time 

271.53 276.05 B: that must be hard but you're just there for the foster care payment checks 

275.82 279.78 A: yes [laughter] no we don't even get paid 

277.06 278.68 B: (( do you get paid for that or volunteer )) 

279.22 280.98 B: (( oh oh all right )) 

280.36 284.09 A: yeah um we thought we would have you know nicer 

284.21 286.91 A: cats this one now is very nice [mn] when she 

286.96 289.77 A: just when we get home and find poop on stuff 

290.23 293.95 A: you know it's not as much of a joy to have her in the house 

294.48 296.00 B: let's see um 

297.78 300.75 B: [lipsmack] how much does it cost to take care of a cat 

300.16 307.51 A: you know it probably costs a lot but thankfully um the agency that we do the foster care for pays all the expenses 

307.37 309.36 B: yeah like kitty litter and food 

309.20 312.67 A: yeah yeah um and all the vet bills and stuff 

312.90 314.65 B: what if it pees on your couch 

314.82 316.88 A: ah we have to clean it up i don't know 

316.16 317.68 B: (( oh all right )) 

317.32 320.99 A: we've yeah i mean you know i had to pay for the house 

318.32 319.41 B: (( well right )) 

321.52 336.07 A: pet deodorizer myself but you know for the most part it but i mean it it can get expensive i think um the last cat we had um had to go to the vet and it was a couple of hundred dollars and they paid me back for it but that was in you know 

337.32 339.83 A: i don't know if i liked it that much [laughter] 

340.03 343.78 B: (( sounds bad ah yeah if you don't )) 

341.23 341.98 A: so 

342.98 349.52 A: what what do you what do you do to take care of a tarantula i mean do you split it just i mean does it like does it want to [mn] be 

349.95 353.42 A: played with or anything or does it just hang out in its cage all day or 

353.09 357.84 B: yeah it hangs out in its cage the ah the highlight seems to be the bird 

357.29 358.29 A: yeah i see 

358.00 359.79 B: 'cause it it jumps 

360.16 361.49 A: (( the tarantula jumps )) 

361.13 370.78 B: yeah the tarantula jumps so it's ah you put it in a big cage with the bird [mn] but ah thankfully you don't have to feed it that often it's just like a bird every two weeks 

362.67 364.00 A: (( mhm oh )) 

370.56 373.51 A: okay that's that's like a snake kind of then 

371.21 372.13 B: yeah 

373.53 377.62 B: yeah so you know we watch it walk around and stuff 

374.47 375.36 A: so 

377.82 379.79 B: we'll put in the occasional bug 

379.81 381.84 B: just to see how it tracks it down 

379.82 380.75 A: mhm 

381.88 382.56 A: (( ahah )) 

382.68 384.25 B: so it's like in an 

384.62 387.84 B: (( arboretum i think you would call it yeah )) 

385.93 386.88 A: yeah 

387.28 388.36 A: (( i think so [mn] )) 

388.48 389.92 B: hold on for a sec 

389.32 390.09 A: okay 

394.28 395.02 A: (( [noise] )) 

400.68 401.90 B: (( hello oh )) 

401.29 402.02 A: (( hi )) 

401.93 402.81 B: okay 

402.59 403.37 A: okay 

403.41 404.19 B: [mn] 

403.84 408.94 A: [mn] so then like the tarantula just leaves like a shell of the bird in your cage in the cage 

409.00 419.89 B: ah yeah well it tends to crush the bird and then you know since the bird can't move any more 'cause its spinal cord is broken it just sucks out the insides 

412.65 413.77 A: mhm 

417.43 418.40 A: right 

419.31 420.61 A: mhm 

419.94 424.19 B: so yeah there is um unsightly scooping needed 

423.99 425.47 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

424.68 429.49 B: but after the first eighteen or so birds you get used to it 

428.92 431.03 A: right ah yeah 

431.52 441.84 A: [lipsmack] um a f- ah my roommate used to live in a house where there were big snakes and so they would feed them mice all the time and because actually it was you know it wasn't even mice it was more like rates 

441.97 442.86 B: wow 

442.52 450.79 A: and it went from i mean these were boas i think so it went from [mn] being sort of gross to fascinating at least when i was over there 

445.26 446.15 B: right 

450.54 451.54 B: yeah 

450.90 452.96 A: (( yeah [mn] so )) 

452.73 461.80 B: i don't know like i i kind of i'm i'm for pets and i'm against pets 'cause i think it's kind of inhumane 

461.82 467.27 B: so i think if i had a snake i'd feed it a variety of animals and just rats 

462.14 463.00 A: mhm 

465.08 467.95 A: mhm yeah 

467.40 471.54 B: like would would you would would the guy ever feed it a cat 

471.72 481.01 A: [mn] um i don't think so i think they just fed it they just um i mean they there's actually in the place i live there's a whole store that just has um 

481.13 486.05 A: [mn] you know snakes and lizards it has snake and lizard supplies and food and stuff 

485.93 487.03 B: (( i see )) 

486.47 494.83 A: and so i just think they got all of the stuff from there and i think all they sold i think they sold rabbits there but i think all they ever s- fed the snake was rats 

495.01 495.75 B: mm 

496.47 499.78 A: so [mn] i guess it's only like you know 

499.79 503.04 A: there's only like certain animals that you're allowed to 

503.92 504.75 B: right 

504.00 506.14 A: eat and serve other animals 

506.09 509.79 B: 'cause then you know when does it stop being humane and start being inhumane 

506.26 507.07 A: like 

509.57 510.98 A: yeah 

510.75 511.44 B: mm 

511.53 516.61 A: yeah well i mean i would feel that way you know i would love to have a dog but my house isn't big enough 

516.47 518.01 B: right 

517.13 518.79 A: and my yard's not big enough 

518.92 520.46 B: it's like um 

520.74 526.14 B: i don't like dogs but i would prefer a cat but i'm definitely allergic to them so 

523.88 524.77 A: mhm 

525.35 527.85 A: [noise] oh so the tarantula's 

527.85 529.45 B: yeah 

528.89 534.54 A: where does does it does it live in your house like in your room or somewhere else in the house 

533.92 538.62 B: yeah it's a it's a big it takes up a big chunk of my room so 

537.82 538.67 A: okay 

538.68 541.09 B: i was getting the tarantula or the futon 

541.33 542.25 B: but 

541.63 542.89 A: [laughter] 

542.28 546.54 B: i don't see myself getting lucky in the near future so i chose 

545.40 547.01 A: [laughter] 

546.60 548.39 B: the the tarantula 

548.32 550.82 A: i guess it has to stay in your room if your mom's gonna 

550.95 552.45 B: yeah exactly 

551.83 553.27 A: (( hit it [mn] [mn] )) 

553.68 561.16 B: um but you know it's not like a cat so it doesn't leave droppings everywhere although a cat doesn't really do that right it's got a cute litter box with it 

561.02 565.38 A: yeah well it's supposed to but the one we have right now doesn't use it very much 

565.19 565.91 B: mm 

566.03 566.84 A: so 

566.52 571.17 B: i thought that was like an innate skill they're born with or is that just something their mothers teach them 

570.72 578.62 A: i don't know she she she uses it most of the time but we think she might be sick with something so we have to take her into the vet 

578.48 579.43 B: oh 

578.64 580.12 A: if she doesn't get better 

580.72 581.62 B: i see [lipsmack] 

582.23 583.14 A: (( [mn] so )) 

583.30 584.50 A: yeah 

587.23 588.38 B: all righty 

588.34 593.36 A: yeah they the yeah [laughter] 

590.77 592.08 B: [laughter] 

592.79 593.99 B: (( ah )) 

593.58 598.93 A: so how many what did what did they ask how many hours a day do you spend with your pet [mn] 

599.34 599.89 B: (( is that what ))
