154.40 162.59 B: we've been thinking about getting a dog um once my my youngest daughter's two and when she's like maybe four or five i was thinking about getting a dog 

161.00 163.92 A: yeah i think that's probably a good time 

163.71 164.89 B: yeah 

164.29 170.41 A: you know they're more aware of how how to treat it and how to act around it 

168.03 169.14 B: mhm 

170.46 171.30 B: right 

170.65 176.35 A: you know and it's good to get you know like probably a puppy when they're small too 

176.60 177.44 B: right 

176.82 180.47 A: so they can get used to each other's size together and 

179.95 180.94 B: mhm 

181.00 182.31 A: (( so that'll be fun )) 

182.17 186.58 B: yeah i want to get a small dog this time though i always had big dogs 

185.93 193.20 A: yeah [laughter] well you have to watch when you have a a child too you know too big a dog 

191.01 192.13 B: mhm 

193.51 199.51 A: because they can get rowdy and playful and really knock a little one down and you don't even realize it's going to happen 

199.34 200.17 B: right 

200.74 201.42 B: (( right )) 

201.40 203.30 A: (( well that'll be good )) 

203.51 210.00 B: my oldest daughter my oldest daughter one time said she wanted a um a pet so we took her she wanted a hamster 

209.61 210.58 A: (( mhm )) 

210.35 216.42 B: and we took her to um the pet store and soon as she saw the hamster she just started saying i don't want one i don't want one 

215.59 218.02 A: (( [laughter] )) 

217.77 223.34 B: honey just pet it just hold it no i don't want to i don't want to i want to go now [laughter] 

222.87 226.45 A: my youngest one talked me into an iguana once yeah 

225.68 228.04 B: oh really [laughter] 

226.85 230.40 A: [laughter] but you should be used to those little critters down there 

230.00 233.71 B: yeah we have we have lizards everywhere outside 

232.68 234.60 A: right [laughter] 

234.00 237.33 B: i actually had an iguana living in our front yard for a while 

236.74 239.12 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

238.51 241.56 B: not one that i would want as a pet [laughter] 

240.18 245.48 A: no they're very strange they're very insular and only care about themselves so 

245.96 248.69 A: but you know they're pretty self sufficient ones 

249.14 253.41 A: anyway better than you know some of the other ones that you have to spend a lot of time with 

253.20 254.95 B: yeah that's true 

254.81 260.60 A: yeah so do you have a a large area that you can have for the dog to rowdy around in or oh 

260.21 263.59 B: medium size area i mean i have a back yard it's it's 

261.48 262.31 A: (( well that's )) 

262.97 263.93 A: mhm 

264.33 267.06 B: medium sized it's not too big not too small 

265.19 266.09 A: yeah 

266.58 271.08 A: well that's good but you don't want a big dog anyway so that's good 

270.46 271.68 B: yeah 

271.10 272.44 A: right 

272.71 274.45 A: and you have how many kids 

274.15 275.91 B: two two girls 

274.63 275.46 A: two 

275.68 277.13 A: two girls well 

276.64 277.98 B: six and two 

277.66 279.88 A: right well they ought to enjoy it then 

280.12 286.15 A: six year olds are old enough and a couple more years she'll be eight and she'll be a big boss and [laughter] you know 

285.39 288.84 B: yeah that's true [laughter] 

286.80 289.39 A: right [laughter] 

290.89 292.11 B: that's true 

292.18 295.55 B: right now her only concern is wanting to go to disney world so 

294.91 302.22 A: ah yeah well and that's really tough being down there close to it no matter where you are you're close to it there 

300.43 303.97 B: yeah but it still costs money [laughter] 

302.54 305.20 A: oh god yeah that's horrible there 

304.82 306.01 B: mhm 

305.66 308.35 A: well maybe she'll go there and see goofy [laughter] 

307.45 309.06 B: yeah there you go 

310.19 314.73 B: that'll be her dog [laughter] for the next few years until we're ready 

311.71 313.90 A: (( [laughter] )) 

314.44 315.94 A: right [laughter] 

316.25 320.23 B: the biggest problem i had when i had dogs especially the black lab 

320.87 322.38 B: was the dog hair 

322.08 323.41 A: oh yeah 

322.63 326.40 B: it was everywhere i would open my refrigerator i would see dog hair 

325.14 327.14 A: and i yeah 

326.51 328.23 B: [laughter] 

327.16 337.03 A: it's like oh wait please [laughter] especially a dark one like that you can see it easily too yeah you'd take the top off the butter and anything and it's like oh 

331.24 332.44 B: mhm 

332.79 334.12 B: mhm 

335.77 336.69 B: (( i )) 

338.55 344.28 B: know and it would be on the ceiling fan and i would say how did it get up there [laughter] 

341.43 342.53 A: yeah 

343.19 349.56 A: that's always disgusting too i mean you don't even realize it and all of a sudden you'll be looking up and you're going like the fan's fuzzy 

349.27 350.49 B: yeah 

349.66 354.54 A: [laughter] you know and sure enough it is dog hair all over it 

353.05 355.07 B: dog hair that's the worst 

355.68 356.61 A: yeah 

356.71 358.28 B: (( that's the worst )) 

357.84 366.58 A: but it's always a challenge it doesn't seem to matter how much time you spend cleaning it it gets like down in cracks and crevices and everything 

363.29 364.40 B: mhm 

366.15 367.29 B: that's right 

366.98 368.07 A: yeah 

367.40 378.37 B: that's right we were living in a different place back then but like even a year after um we didn't have them any more th- there was still dog hair in places you know 

377.65 381.98 A: i've i've noticed that in my car i keep turning them up you know [laughter] so 

381.44 382.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

382.76 389.61 A: we decided a shepherd last christmas we got her from a from a pet welfare place 

389.93 397.61 A: but she just wouldn't stay contained in the yard she ran so much and we were just afraid she was going to killed or cause somebody's wreck 

397.16 398.65 B: yeah 

397.86 401.90 A: so we had to we have her to a friend that had a larger area for her 

402.13 404.47 A: but i'm still finding plenty of dog 

404.70 408.69 A: stuff around you know [laughter] hair all over the place still 

406.61 407.62 B: yeah 

410.17 414.56 B: we um we had we had a dog we had to give to a shelter once she um 

414.63 424.17 B: was a beagle and when she was still a puppy i don't know how she old she was she was ten or eleven months old i mean this dog needed so much attention she tore up everything 

415.75 416.65 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

423.44 424.95 A: oh wow 

424.38 428.39 B: tore i mean everything my shoes clothes furniture 

427.49 429.00 A: [laughter] 

428.40 438.47 B: and one day she went in to our bedroom and she wasn't in there for more than five minutes and we walked in and there was a hole in the mattress of the bed bigger than the dog 

437.75 439.11 A: (( oh )) 

439.23 452.70 B: i don't know how in five minutes she tore this hole in the bed it was huge we had to get rid of the mattress and we took the dog down to the shelter 'cause we just couldn't do it any more we we had two other dogs also [laughter] 

444.15 445.37 A: yeah well 

449.49 450.74 A: (( oh no )) 

452.78 454.49 B: so yeah it was 

453.41 456.54 A: yeah not when they need that much attention like that 

455.27 456.01 B: yeah 

457.23 460.62 A: and and you wonder what causes them to do that you know 

459.91 461.71 B: i know i know 

461.13 464.80 A: i mean had you had it all along or had you got it older 

463.32 467.56 B: she was she was a puppy when we got her she was 

466.24 470.01 A: oh so you didn't have to think that maybe she'd been mistreated or something 

469.66 475.17 B: no she was a puppy when she got here the only thing i can think of maybe she was taken away from her mother too young 

474.57 476.02 A: (( mm could be )) 

475.84 477.54 B: something like that but 

476.70 481.62 A: yeah 'cause one of my cats is a little strange and i know he was taken from his mother way too young 

482.14 486.10 A: and so i i really do think that affects them sometimes 

482.21 483.47 B: yeah 

486.22 498.43 B: yeah my um my best friend has three cats and the one never really had a mother i'm not sure why but it was bottle fed and everything when it was when it was that's her biggest problem cat 

492.76 493.71 A: mhm 

497.81 499.15 A: yeah 

498.65 503.06 B: um you know it needs constant attention and stuff mhm 

500.96 502.15 A: exactly 

502.41 504.34 A: that's all this one has too [laughter] 

504.29 505.21 B: yeah 

504.70 510.91 A: yeah the other two pretty much you know they leave you alone and stay on their own but this one's always up on you so 

510.67 512.00 B: mhm 

511.37 512.26 A: yeah 

513.32 517.75 A: but that's how they are you know pets they rule us we rule them [laughter] 

519.17 528.91 B: we babysat my sister's dog for about ten days she was she was out of town on vacation and um the first few days we loved it and we were like oh this is great we want to get a dog 

528.34 529.36 A: mhm 

529.03 535.25 B: it was so nice and the kids really enjoyed it it was a little tiny da- dachshund i don't know how your pronounce it um 

532.89 534.90 A: uh-huh yeah 

535.53 538.71 B: but um then it got sick i don't know 

537.71 538.56 A: (( yeah )) 

538.77 543.68 B: and it was throwing up everywhere and i said you know what i don't i don't want to deal with this right now 

542.37 548.12 A: i don't want this i have babies i don't need this too [laughter] 

545.89 546.85 B: (( yeah )) 

547.77 552.05 B: i don't need this you know they get sick enough and then to have the dog get sick and 

551.45 553.94 A: exactly exactly 

552.75 558.49 B: it went under my bed and threw up and then i had to take the bed out to clean it up oh it was terrible 

557.49 564.74 A: yeah 'cause they can get like back in places that you know a child isn't going to get into and you're like oh what is that [laughter] 

560.29 561.45 B: mhm 

564.14 565.10 B: (( i know )) 

564.99 565.80 A: (( you know )) 

566.36 573.37 A: well there's a lot of concern too because they can pick up things you know out in the yard ticks and stuff i don't know if you have ticks down there or not 

573.94 580.76 B: um yeah we do have ticks i think i had one problem once with the dog getting with one of my dogs getting ticks 

575.80 576.70 A: yeah 

580.27 581.78 A: right 

581.46 585.69 B: it's not it wasn't too bad but fleas on the other hand yeah 

584.41 587.00 A: (( oh yeah no kidding )) 

587.29 590.70 A: and do the ants bother him down there the fire ants 

590.53 599.95 B: mm no i haven't really had a problem with fire ants down here no we get black ants in the house sometimes and but no i haven't really had a problem with fire ants 

593.39 594.43 A: oh really 

596.60 597.75 A: yeah
