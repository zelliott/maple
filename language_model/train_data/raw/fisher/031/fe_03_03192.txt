22.71 25.11 B: uh i had a small dog 

24.97 27.84 A: oh what kind of dog

33.35 34.61 A: oh yes oh 

34.89 36.29 B: yeah 

35.00 36.38 A: yeah they're very nice 

36.35 38.71 B: yeah so do you have a pet right now 

38.15 44.70 A: no right now i don't uh i had a pet in fact i've had several but the last one i had was a terrier 

45.58 52.68 B: mm yeah so what uh how how long how much time did you spend with the pets initially 

52.19 55.67 A: um then well i spent quite a bit um 

56.08 61.93 A: w- o- outside of working hours i was home a lot and i spent all that time with my pet then 

58.19 59.16 B: mhm 

62.10 65.29 B: okay so so now do you miss them 

65.09 68.96 A: no i don't have a pet anymore so i don't spend any time with them [noise] 

68.91 72.82 B: [noise] yeah i see i even i used to spend a lot of time with my pets 

72.89 76.86 B: initially but uh since i had to come to united states 

76.95 90.51 B: and then i had i didn't have pets and the kind of rules and regulations that go with for having a pet here is much different from back in my country here i think you have to register your pet and other stuff like that right 

89.82 91.23 A: yeah so 

90.85 94.70 B: uh so it involves a lot of work 'cause over there it's not much 

95.38 97.65 B: so i'm not going to actually 

97.71 109.34 A: well here it depends on the kind of pet you have and if and if you're a hunter or something like that some some southerners believe that animals like dogs need to live outside they don't bring them in the house 

102.63 103.82 B: (( mm mm )) 

109.59 113.06 A: and they use them for hunting and things like that but they're 

109.98 110.71 B: oh 

113.13 118.65 A: they're not really pet pets in the same sen- sense of you know having a house pet 

117.22 117.91 B: ye- 

118.34 126.80 B: i understand that yeah and actually once when i was going from um going to washington d._c. i saw someone having a lion as a pet 

126.36 129.07 A: [laughter] yeah 

127.98 135.26 B: uh i i was travelling in my car and i saw him in there there was a truck that was going next to me 

134.61 135.50 A: (( oh )) 

135.09 145.51 B: and uh i be stopped some place and we saw there was a lion that was tied to the truck it was sitting inside the truck and it was a lion i was scared 

145.33 149.03 A: wow yeah that's kind of an unusual pet 

148.75 152.22 B: yeah even though it was chained i was really scared that day 

149.42 150.19 A: yeah 

151.54 153.32 A: yeah 

152.31 154.31 B: so that kind of thing happens so 

154.36 159.08 B: [noise] so what are the things you think uh what are the difficulties in having a pet 

159.65 165.50 A: well uh i think as a single person anymore uh having a pet uh 

163.37 164.04 B: (( mm )) 

166.25 167.75 A: obligates you to 

167.77 173.55 A: stay home a little bit more than you would and uh take care of it of course 

169.75 171.01 B: mhm 

172.58 173.79 B: (( uh that's )) 

174.10 180.01 B: that's true one of my friends was a single guy and he he had a cat 

180.44 191.13 B: so he had a lot of tr- trouble uh maintaining it because he was living on the third floor he couldn't keep the windows open the cat would just jump out of it 

186.68 187.56 A: (( oh )) 

190.82 192.67 A: (( oh my gosh [laughter] )) 

192.14 195.67 B: so what he used to do was he used to have something like drug 

195.94 202.45 B: (( [laughter] he had a drug kind of thing for the cat i think they sell it well for sell it in stores drug stores )) 

196.13 197.45 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

202.05 203.10 A: (( yeah )) 

202.51 208.59 B: uh pet stores you just go buy and just uh place it near the cat's uh nose 

209.08 212.22 B: then it becomes really calm something like that so 

211.93 213.18 A: oh wow 

212.83 218.01 B: and that kind of thing happens so and what do you think are the advantages of having a pet [noise] 

218.11 223.58 A: well according to medical studies having a pet uh helps some people live longer 

223.87 228.30 B: okay wh- and wh- what might be the reason for it 

224.69 225.64 A: yeah 

227.86 234.57 A: uh probably it gives them companionship and makes them feel a little bit more uh at ease and uh 

233.16 234.48 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

234.71 236.11 A: relaxed 

235.65 236.80 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

236.50 237.50 A: uh 

238.12 243.71 A: and in some cases uh if the dog is big enough and it's a dog and they feel protection 

242.24 243.09 B: (( [laughter] )) 

243.86 248.14 B: that's true that's true so it's more protection as well as companionship 

247.53 249.63 A: right 

248.58 253.88 B: yeah but uh it costs a lot to ha- uh maintain a pet here right 

254.15 259.32 A: yes i think so uh by the time you get the dog uh all of its shots 

259.16 259.94 B: (( mm )) 

259.56 267.84 A: and uh you you uh take good care of them and feed them and uh exercise them it not only takes a lot of money it takes a lot of time 

267.75 273.61 B: oh that's true that's true because the one thing also i remember when i was travelling by air 

273.62 280.02 B: and someone had their pet along with them so they had to pay a full fare for the pet 

280.17 285.12 B: so it was about a hundred and fifty dollars returning from say new york city to somewhere in ohio 

284.63 286.68 A: (( yeah )) 

285.55 292.83 B: so they had to pay that amount of money to just carry the pet so that kind of thing and i also see some positions in my local 

292.91 298.63 B: city website a lot of people actually pay a lot of money when they go to the city to 

298.72 300.41 B: take care of their pets so 

300.35 301.30 A: yeah 

300.72 304.41 B: and they that sounds interesting because people care for them a lot [noise] 

304.76 310.71 A: oh that's probably a good thing and if you can afford it why i think it that's a good thing too 

305.14 305.89 B: so 

306.32 307.74 B: mhm 

309.05 309.66 B: (( yes )) 

310.40 314.03 B: (( why not yeah if you can afford it why not yeah that's true )) 

313.40 316.49 A: i have a friend who has two very large dogs 

316.14 317.32 B: (( mhm )) 

316.68 320.29 A: uh they're nice kind gentle dogs 

320.19 321.16 B: mhm 

320.38 328.01 A: i don't think they're very good watchdogs but [laughter] 'cause [laughter] they lick you when you come in inside of bite [laughter] 

323.09 324.47 B: [laughter] 

326.83 331.42 B: okay [laughter] so even though they are huge they are not really 

328.23 329.56 A: but uh 

330.91 336.16 A: right she takes good care of them and uh they're her companions and uh 

332.15 333.02 B: [laughter] 

336.27 338.17 A: and she can afford it so 

338.22 341.07 A: if yeah that's fine 

338.34 339.64 B: (( why not yeah )) 

340.96 345.25 B: yeah that's true um is this the first time participating 

346.15 347.23 A: (( [noise] yeah i'm sorry )) 

347.35 349.35 A: e- excuse me 

347.39 348.43 B: uh is this 

348.52 352.24 B: (( is this the first time you are participating in this phone conversation )) 

352.24 353.30 A: i don't know 

353.63 354.61 B: okay 

355.97 358.43 B: (( is this your first time )) 

357.54 361.49 A: no uh i had a time or two before

399.12 403.82 B: yeah and i am very sure in the future there are going to be pets that way 

403.95 407.53 B: and i think even though you might have a robotic pet and other things where 

407.80 417.57 B: you have a small robot which you take care of as a pet or something like that might something like that might happen yeah some all the str- all the strange thing happens yeah
