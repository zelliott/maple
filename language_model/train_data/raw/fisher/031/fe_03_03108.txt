50.93 58.81 A: yeah the i mean the kids well i got a four and a five year old so you know they're kind of rough on the dog and the dog takes it you know it doesn't growl or nothing

67.89 68.87 A: no 

68.59 75.68 B: mind you sh- this one i have loves kids though but i think it would get tired awfully quickly with a four and five years old

79.41 81.59 A: (( that's it ))

86.04 88.31 B: yeah do you spend lots of time with it 

88.25 91.51 A: [mn] i i i guess so i mean ah 

91.84 92.74 A: you know [mn] 

92.81 99.61 A: someone's usually home so that you know the dogs got used to someone being here like eighty per cent of the time and ah 

99.64 107.50 A: you know when we leave it gets sad and one time we we went on vacation and we had to leave it in a kennel and it actually lost like five pounds in a few days 

107.12 108.04 B: oh yeah [mn] 

108.04 110.82 A: yeah so it's a people dog 

110.41 115.55 B: dogs will do that eh if you go away the masters go away they won't eat and they won't ah 

115.66 117.08 B: do the usual 

117.20 118.01 A: (( ah )) 

117.84 125.79 B: it's the same with my husky it's ah you can't leave it i mean you have to take it along or have somebody come to the house to babysit it because it won't stay in a kennel 

126.58 127.38 A: (( oh )) 

127.20 129.32 B: it won't ah it'll get sick 

130.59 138.69 A: well we've had ah i know when we'll go pick up the kids from school we've actually had the dog we'll try to lock it on the front porch 'cause we've got an enclosed porch and ah 

138.66 152.41 A: the dog will break out and the school's like a b- you know two a block or two away and the dog will actually run around the neighborhood until it finds the car and then when we're sitting outside the school it will actually sit by the driver's side door and wait for us to let the dog in 

152.66 154.05 B: yeah 

153.50 160.95 A: so it- it's definitely ah got an attachment to the family definitely a a people dog 

157.45 159.03 B: (( oh yes it certainly does )) 

160.33 163.15 B: yeah well this husky i have is a it's 

163.46 165.50 B: (( a a a sleigh dog you know )) 

165.64 167.43 A: yeah 

166.16 168.81 B: and they like to run and they like walking 

169.27 172.82 B: like this one we go for a walk in the morning about forty minutes 

169.77 170.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

173.13 175.88 B: we go for a walk at night about thirty minutes 

176.33 179.15 B: it really ah it's good for the exercise [laughter] 

179.32 180.83 A: yeah 

181.32 183.51 B: and it runs around the yard all day it 

183.91 187.31 A: [noise] ah does it did you get the dog as a puppy or did you 

187.09 195.84 B: was a year old when we got it it's ah yeah it was ah i guess it was a dog that had ah ill treatment or something and we got it from the s._p._a. 

188.94 190.15 A: (( oh okay )) 

195.63 197.11 A: oh okay 

196.74 201.21 B: yeah and it's a it's a pretty nice dog actually its very friendly and it ah 

201.41 204.90 B: took a little while to get it adjusted to this new life you know 

205.43 210.07 B: but ah once it knows it's ah it's got a good life it really holds onto it 

205.76 208.86 A: (( yeah )) 

210.85 213.04 A: [mn] oh that's good 

211.88 214.52 B: yeah yeah it's about seven years old now 

214.74 216.58 A: (( oh yeah )) 

214.98 228.89 B: we we've had it for six years yeah and most people when they see us walking without the leash with this husky they're how do you do it because huskies usually don't just heel you know they they'll run away and they won't come back and stuff like this 

217.46 218.19 A: (( oh )) 

226.36 228.05 A: yeah 

229.94 231.33 B: but this one i guess 

230.04 231.47 A: so it'll stick 

231.64 233.14 A: it'll stick by you huh 

232.85 240.42 B: yeah well this one we've been walking long long enough so it will just stick by me and if i call it it comes and ah 

233.86 235.09 A: wow 

238.40 239.26 A: (( [mn] )) 

240.45 242.38 B: but it sure loves kids though 

242.42 247.64 A: yeah well me too we take the dog for a walk we gotta keep a leash 'cause it's g- it's got that hunting instinct [mn] 

247.38 248.43 B: oh yeah yeah 

247.81 250.16 A: and ah you know we we 

250.28 252.87 A: you know it'll it'll stay by us without a leash 

252.63 253.45 B: yeah 

252.89 254.61 A: but if it sees a rabbit 

254.83 263.13 A: it's gone and ah you know that dog will actually keep the rabbit has to hide it cannot it won't the dog will keep up with the rabbit 

254.88 257.04 B: [laughter] 

257.31 259.07 B: (( oh yeah )) 

262.12 263.93 B: yeah well it's a retriever eh [laughter] 

263.94 274.83 A: yeah that's what they do [mn] but it w- it won't chase cats i mean there could be a cat in our yard and the dog will walk right past it but yeah but if it sees a rabbit it's 

265.54 266.47 B: yeah 

267.38 268.14 B: no 

270.86 271.94 B: is that right 

274.19 275.30 B: yeah 

275.03 280.32 A: it's going through whatever it's gotta go through jumping over cars running over people just to get to that rabbit 

279.06 282.66 B: [laughter] oh it's raised the hunting instinct in it 

284.47 291.42 A: yeah but he she won't she won't fetch you know if you like try to you know throw a ball at her she'll ah you know she'll bring it back once 

288.64 289.41 B: yeah 

291.57 292.46 B: is that right 

291.85 295.90 A: [mn] and then after that she'll make you go get it yeah [mn] [mn] 

295.26 299.19 B: you never tried to train it for ah retrieving ducks or anything like this 

300.01 309.85 A: no i d- i i don't i don't think it would i guess the reason why they got rid of it at the farm that we got her from she was chasing the chickens and eating 'em 

308.99 310.86 B: [laughter] okay 

309.97 312.72 A: so you know you take the dog hunting 

310.88 312.41 B: (( i guess it's got it's not ))

329.13 330.81 A: yeah 

330.71 332.45 B: yeah so you have any other pets no 

332.74 334.72 A: no just the just the dog 

334.43 337.35 B: yeah well this one we have here we've got two cats 

338.18 339.52 A: (( oh you got cats too )) 

339.32 344.98 B: yeah they got two cats ah it's my daughters' cats they're away so we're keeping the cats 

345.44 346.40 A: (( ahah ))

355.03 356.72 B: but they get used to it 

357.07 365.46 A: someone can walk in our house and the dog doesn't care [mn] it'll it'll see if the person's got food and if the person doesn't have food the dog leaves 'em alone
