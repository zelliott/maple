154.78 157.08 A: oh yeah on the west coast that's true 

157.21 164.16 B: yeah well at at microsoft you know we get you know those are the those are the big three um computer schools for them 

159.49 160.72 A: oh yeah oh 

162.38 165.12 A: are you near are you near redmond or no 

165.23 168.45 B: oh i i work at microsoft corporate redmond 

167.79 178.60 A: oh do you really i just uh i take like a management one oh one class and uh that was that was like the last case was how you guys took over i don't if you know front page came vermeer technologies 

168.99 170.66 B: yeah 

178.43 184.19 B: yes i know that [laughter] i was actually in the acquisition [laughter] 

182.27 185.27 A: (( really get out )) 

184.95 185.56 B: (( yeah )) 

185.51 187.05 A: that's incredible [laughter] that's 

186.76 188.86 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

188.50 191.49 A: (( really cool what was your name maybe and maybe i read about you i don't know )) 

191.77 195.02 B: no i was i'm a dev i would be behind the scenes 

194.90 196.09 A: uh okay 

196.17 198.68 A: but you were part of microsoft and then you 

196.79 197.72 B: but 

198.45 208.87 B: i was part of microsoft i did some of the analysis on the on vermeer's technology but yeah but i think spyglass was a bit of a better purchase i mean 

204.18 205.14 A: yeah 

209.02 216.24 B: front page actually sells reasonably well but god do i loathe the technology it's it's a security nightmare 

211.47 212.34 A: uh-huh 

216.37 219.60 B: [laughter] well 

216.70 218.03 A: (( r- really )) 

219.83 229.84 B: so it throws a bunch of crap on to the server to allow remote managements it's been it's essentially how front page is the client software reaches up and creates the websites 

230.15 237.13 B: well that means you're giving pretty open control of one server to anyone who wants to use it 

236.96 238.12 A: (( oh )) 

237.10 251.75 B: and right and the protocol is horribly loose and it's hard to upgrade these things because of back you know you if we actually locked down a protocol to you know do everything via some sort of authenticated encrypted law 

251.67 260.18 B: um all of the existing deployments and peop- and a lot of companies have very large scale um like document flow written around this now 

260.10 273.08 B: all of that would break so on the one hand there's this huge open issue with like most of the i._s._p.s out there not wanting to host front page because it's just you know it's an open invitation to let people take your servers over 

273.54 278.30 B: and on the other hand if we upgrade it we screw a bunch of existing clients so 

278.70 279.88 A: (( oh okay )) 

279.06 280.52 B: (( what a pain in the ass )) 

280.49 281.55 A: yeah 

280.83 284.24 B: [laughter] spyglass worked out a little better except for the whole 

284.55 290.12 B: um lawsuit thing [laughter] 

286.84 287.78 A: right 

288.84 296.71 A: that's really cool though that's it's a small world [laughter] 'cause yeah we're reading all about i don't know chris peters is a manager is that right 

292.06 292.90 B: (( mm )) 

296.11 297.59 B: (( mhm )) 

296.96 305.73 A: yeah and like randy frogard i'd i'd just i'm just thinking picking the names there's so much material that yeah it's really cool 

305.66 310.01 B: it's funny those are names i haven't heard in a while [laughter] 

306.19 307.18 A: (( but i )) 

308.22 315.46 A: [laughter] who's are they all still part of the uh the company or did a lot of them drop out yet or 

315.19 319.37 B: you know i've i honestly don't know i haven't thought of either of those guys in 

320.06 323.38 B: five years [laughter] been 

321.53 322.54 A: (( really )) 

322.61 324.01 A: (( yeah )) 

323.95 333.66 B: you know when you work eighty to a hundred hours a week five years is a really long time [laughter] like dude that's a million lines of code ago 

328.01 331.68 A: that's true that's true so much happens in between yeah 

333.42 335.23 A: [laughter] 

334.61 337.17 B: [laughter] 

335.85 338.85 A: do you uh is that do you work like eighty hours a week 

339.35 349.39 B: uh there are times when you're waiting for management to figure out what we're doing next i mean software kind of runs in in cyc- did you just drop off 

349.97 362.78 B: nope you're there um software kind of loops through cycles and there are times where you're not really there's nothing to really dev so you're kinda like hanging around rolling in at noon leaving at three barbecuing a lot working in the yard and giving you 

362.66 374.85 B: reading specs and giving input on what people think they want to do next and then you get down to the part where you actually have to do work and yeah you'll spike up to doing i think my longest week so far is a hundred and sixteen hours 

366.46 367.69 A: right right 

369.19 370.24 A: mhm 

374.82 376.01 A: yeah 

375.03 385.48 B: that would be all of them [laughter] actually that's not true the longest the longest single block of time i've ever worked was not when i was doing software it was when i was doing intelligence 

377.28 378.27 A: wow 

385.53 395.64 B: um the wall came down in eighty nine and i was doing intercept analysis for uh seventeen straight days 

395.35 396.46 A: wow 

396.16 401.66 B: [laughter] no sleep lots of speed [laughter] 

396.98 397.85 A: (( oh shit )) 

399.26 400.24 A: yeah 

400.59 401.80 A: [laughter] 

402.76 403.93 A: wow 

404.89 406.10 A: that's crazy 

405.39 419.28 B: yeah the government has really good speed [laughter] we would come up with some really interesting things to make sleep not necessary [laughter] but with all the drawbacks of actually doing speed like rabid paranoia 

408.85 410.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

419.51 423.44 A: was that is that is that do a lot of guys do drugs or uh at microsoft or 

424.07 434.89 B: oh no of course not but um when i was doing intelligence work uh the government actually issues it right if if you're like when you're flying uh combat missions and blah blah blah blah blah blah 

429.99 431.22 A: (( oh oh )) 

434.76 440.72 B: they have all sorts of chemicals to keep you alert and awake when you're getting one hour of sleep or so a day for months 

440.63 445.35 A: wow but how so microsoft what is that subsidized by 

445.70 448.77 A: that's that's that's taken care of by the government 

448.87 452.11 B: no no no i used to work for u._s. intelligence 

451.78 453.99 A: oh oh all right now 

452.97 464.81 B: i used to work for the nsa [laughter] yeah different company [laughter] yeah i used to work for quote the company [laughter] as it were 

454.62 456.61 A: oh okay now i understand 

458.63 460.77 A: oh okay now i understand [laughter] 

464.80 466.95 A: right right right right 

467.27 468.32 A: wow 

467.74 469.14 B: (( oh )) 

468.87 472.90 A: is that is that legal though or is it that supposed to be like 

472.99 478.41 B: legal hm you ask the question of whether or not something the government does is legal 

479.03 484.92 B: [laughter] think about the irony [laughter] 

479.94 481.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

481.78 485.78 A: well you know [laughter] you have to ask 

485.36 490.02 B: yeah i think wa- was this recent war legal hm history will tell us 

488.68 489.72 A: yeah 

489.80 492.15 A: exactly exactly 

489.97 502.83 B: [laughter] when you're the government and you have all the guns and you make up laws it's legal until you get caught [laughter] but it is standard operating procedure [laughter] 

496.90 498.28 A: right right 

500.67 502.04 A: exactly 

503.05 504.03 A: cool 

505.21 506.42 A: but uh 

507.04 508.55 A: yeah [laughter] 

508.78 511.61 A: so are you with your pets right now [laughter] 

511.65 522.68 B: yeah actually i had one of them just come up he was being all angsty cats are so funny they're totally autonomous but then they go through these moods where suddenly right now they absolutely need attention 

522.28 523.68 A: yeah 

523.24 528.71 B: [laughter] this one especially he's the neurotic in the bunch 

525.16 526.10 A: [laughter] 

528.60 529.74 A: [laughter] 

528.94 529.66 B: [laughter] 

531.37 532.29 A: yeah 

532.55 533.70 A: (( that's funny )) 

533.36 534.93 B: so funny 

534.78 537.03 A: so uh trying to think 

536.01 538.46 B: cats would make a great um 

538.48 542.30 B: tool for beginning psychology 'cause 

541.34 542.22 A: yeah 

542.34 555.50 B: they do have the same weird neurotic obsessive compulsive patterns a lot of people do but it's so much more obvious in a cat [laughter] 'cause like one it's not masked behind a semantic layer 

548.43 549.27 A: uh-huh 

550.82 552.01 A: yeah 

555.33 556.31 A: right 

555.72 561.60 B: and two they really don't know how to hide what it is that they're feeling so it's it's when they're 

561.48 574.61 B: when they'll run over and desperately need attention but too afraid to jump up on your lap and get it and then run away and cry in the corner it's really obvious that that's what they're doing where when people do that they usually explain it a little bit and it's not nearly so obvious exactly what they're doing 

574.25 575.44 A: (( right )) 

576.04 578.33 A: wow [laughter] 

578.49 579.61 A: cats 

579.92 581.71 B: jeeze 

579.97 589.59 A: trying to think what other pets i don't know we've i mean in my lifetime i had a bird that my grandpa found half it was like half dead behind a uh [laughter] behind a garbage can so 

589.51 591.00 B: yeah 

589.69 594.80 A: that was that was my pet and then uh goldfish and a rabbit and that's about it 

591.46 593.80 B: (( yeah yeah and that )) 

594.56 599.30 B: ah the ones that i miss are dogs i was raised by wolves 

599.56 599.95 B: (( we ))
