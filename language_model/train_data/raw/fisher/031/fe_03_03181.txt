190.34 191.79 B: not really 

191.87 193.61 B: um if you're if you 

193.86 201.29 B: first thing when you get your cat you should definitely take it to the vet and have it checked out to make sure that there's no underlying health issue 

200.99 202.68 A: mhm 

201.53 208.11 B: and then you just kind of have to maintain them i mean they're pretty pretty self i mean other than the standard shots that you need to go 

208.57 210.09 B: and get for them 

210.32 214.70 B: on a regular basis and once again there's lots of free clinics or low cost clinics 

215.21 216.50 B: for pets 

216.71 219.00 B: like through a._s._p._c._a. 

219.04 220.26 B: um 

220.51 222.36 B: sometimes at pet's mart 

222.22 223.96 A: mhm

238.72 243.40 A: um [cough] yeah we have like like three males and like three three females that are 

244.37 249.91 A: the females are most likely from you know from neighborhood gossip is they've been 

250.02 253.70 A: well treated and i think a couple of them have actually been taken in to be fixed 

253.25 255.64 B: yeah [noise] definitely say neuter 

255.32 256.43 A: mhm 

255.77 263.64 B: there's there's too many kittens and unwanted kittens and animals in the world there's no reason to continue it by not spaying and neutering 

262.95 274.51 A: that's right no i you know i highly agree with that and there's actually i'm not sure who actually i think the humane society came away in here like there's a apartment right across from where we live 

267.70 268.82 B: (( i mean there's )) 

274.58 287.09 A: had like seven [noise] seven or eight dogs [noise] hold on a second we're having severe weather [noise] but [noise] okay that's better yeah they're having tornadoes and the like in southern illinois right now

320.69 322.35 A: yeah bye go now 

322.45 329.43 B: [laughter] no but see going back to the pets thing even in severe weather a lot of people don't think about their animals 

322.90 324.00 A: (( yeah )) 

326.59 327.61 A: mhm 

330.03 336.09 B: [noise] okay which is sad they're the last things that you think about when you're in danger yourself 

336.02 337.29 A: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

336.68 338.92 B: [noise] so even when people evacuate [noise] 

339.61 340.63 A: (( right and it's )) 

339.78 341.34 B: for whatever reason 

342.05 342.99 B: you know 

343.20 345.22 B: the pets are usually left behind [noise] 

345.89 348.83 A: yeah actually my sister my sister's like a pet freak 

349.46 356.59 A: and you know we hear about it all the time is like she rides around she finds you know in pouring rain finds dogs tied to 

357.43 359.27 B: posts [laughter] [noise] 

358.74 367.95 A: tied to the post tied to everything in the middle of the rain without any form of shelter and i mean she's gone up a couple of times to houses and said well you know he hey 

368.06 369.25 B: (( mhm [noise] yeah [laughter] )) 

368.27 370.48 A: your dog's drowning out back yeah it's like 

371.40 374.31 A: you know but she has like she has four dogs 

374.81 378.40 A: like three cats and she has she picks up every stray known 

379.21 383.66 A: which isn't a bad thing she's really great with them she nurses them back to health but 

385.45 390.89 A: you know uh yeah i think every every time i go back to indianapolis like here's what i saw and i'm like okay 

393.05 394.39 B: yeah um 

394.80 396.53 B: (( i'm going to head in [noise] )) 

397.40 403.57 B: another thing that the other thing with cats as far as being a pet the the only thing you have to do is maintain a litter box 

399.69 400.52 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

403.60 405.47 B: which sometimes gets a little tedious 

405.68 409.79 B: but there is products out there such as the litter maid which is a wonderful thing [noise] 

411.28 415.70 B: and uh that pretty much you know [noise] a weekly or 

416.36 418.35 B: bi weekly dumping of it 

419.08 424.42 B: it keeps the bathroom [noise] fairly clean [noise] and cats cuts down on the cat odor so 

420.89 422.59 A: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

426.46 427.97 B: it's pretty good 

426.64 434.99 A: you know you know what's what's a good i i know there's a couple of cats out here has some hair balls they're coughing hair balls is there a specific diet 

435.36 437.72 A: that kind of cuts down on that or mhm 

437.21 446.40 B: well once again yes there is uh they've come up with diets for cats that cough up hair balls um 

446.46 448.04 B: science diet has one 

448.38 452.59 B: but [noise] basically what it is is that it's a fat saturater [laughter] 

452.78 457.90 B: okay you almost can get the same effect by taking either bacon grease and putting it on the cat's neck [noise] 

458.37 465.82 B: okay [laughter] that's the lower cost way just take some old-fashioned bacon grease or if don't have that you can use a [noise] dab of vaseline 

465.36 466.62 A: (( mhm okay [laughter] okay huh oh )) 

466.57 472.04 B: [noise] okay and then the cat just ingests it and it passes the fur ball [noise] basically that's what happens 

472.42 479.04 B: is that the the fur lines the stomach and there's nothing there's not enough fat in their diet esp- especially if they're domesticated 

478.12 479.39 A: (( cool mhm mhm [laughter] )) 

479.35 483.39 B: through canned cat food or whatever to pass it 

483.64 495.54 B: [noise] so by adding that additional fat either on their nose or actually letting them just have a specialized diet which is high in fat just like people what that does is it causes blockage in their arteries [laughter] 

496.45 497.38 B: okay 

497.70 500.68 B: so and then there is like um some 

500.69 504.44 B: some things that you can get over the counter that are in like aluminum tubes 

503.61 504.77 A: mhm 

505.00 513.11 B: that are like laxatone or petromalt [noise] and there are actually hair ball remedies and it's like crumblized type item 

507.12 508.37 A: (( mhm okay )) 

513.31 514.64 B: that the cat can 

515.41 518.21 B: you put it on the cat's nose and it's supposed to uh 

518.49 522.07 B: be tasty for them it comes several different flavors 

521.56 523.32 A: mhm 

523.58 524.46 A: cool 

524.15 526.96 B: [laughter] but 

526.21 533.25 A: [laughter] i sure didn't realize there was so much out there for cats i mean you really don't hear about it i mean the commercials are usually about dogs 

532.61 533.57 B: dogs 

533.90 538.27 B: yeah cats kind of get left out [laughter] 'cause they're so independent [laughter] 

537.69 538.61 A: (( yeah they're )) 

538.92 543.65 A: (( i don't know why it is 'cause like they're a lot easier to take care of than a dog but [cough] hm )) 

543.07 546.00 B: oh you know they have their needs um 

546.16 550.97 B: my boy cat sometimes wants to go out for a walk he's got a leash he's leash trained 

550.59 551.90 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

551.14 561.45 B: and he'll go off for a very secure little walk in the very short area and then you know there's other times where the other cats will not even venture anywhere close to the door 

562.43 563.24 B: so 

565.33 568.81 B: they're pretty good and i also have two hermit crabs 

568.92 569.92 A: oh cool 

569.70 576.72 B: those are absolutely low maintenance 'cause they're scavengers um they pretty much eat anything but commercial 

573.03 573.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

577.40 579.59 B: hermit crab food is probably the best 

579.13 580.69 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

579.97 582.20 B: but i got those because i'm a schoolteacher [sigh] 

582.37 583.98 A: (( wha- what grade )) 

583.83 584.75 B: fifth grade 

585.71 588.46 A: huh taken 'em in to show and tell yeah 

585.71 586.29 B: (( yeah )) 

588.41 592.44 B: uh no um as part of a 

592.71 595.20 B: food ware biology type 

595.75 597.23 B: science thing so
