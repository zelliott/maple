291.88 293.60 B: land out in the back 

293.23 294.67 A: yeah 

293.96 296.70 B: so it costs too much money to build a fence 

296.96 304.02 B: so we want something we can keep you know keep clean and keep together and up near the house if we got a dog it'd run off 

297.00 298.27 A: oh yeah

322.50 324.97 B: you know that are that are more of an issue

328.70 329.81 B: yeah 

329.21 338.46 A: yeah and then he might run off but you never know four years old you know she might start when she's six or seven or eight [mn] daddy can i get a dog

573.09 574.00 B: right 

573.37 580.89 A: and they push their nose on it every day just to see if you didn't latch it or something they're quite a little bastard
