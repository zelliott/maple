38.37 44.60 A: first of all i'm uh i'm married and uh we don't have any children so uh 

43.24 44.18 B: uh-huh 

44.45 53.64 A: having a dog or a cat is kind of kind of not good for the pet we figured so we don't have any pets um 

53.92 61.51 A: we don't have any small pets because you know we just we do things and my wife has a medical condition right now so uh we're not 

61.90 73.52 A: thinking of getting a pet either um plus um my wife got attacked by uh two dogs a few years ago and she got she got uh she had to go to the hospital and everything so 

73.30 74.38 B: oh no 

73.42 79.62 A: we kind of you know we kind of but pretty much everybody else we know has a pet [laughter] 

79.19 82.60 B: well you kind of get to live vicariously then through them 

81.93 84.29 A: yeah yeah 

84.34 85.69 A: so how about you 

85.35 93.27 B: well we [sigh] you know my fiancee wants a cat we both really like cats a lot but we're both kind of allergic to them 

92.40 93.49 A: (( mhm mm )) 

93.29 94.59 B: so 

94.90 104.61 B: [sigh] it's kind of a question of we we we just moved into a new house so before we never had room and um now we have room but 

104.84 115.72 B: we're both off doing school so we don't have a lot of time either to really dedicate so we we don't really want to get a dog because we don't think it'd be fair to the dog 

108.03 109.32 A: oh yeah 

114.50 117.38 A: that's what we feel too yeah 

116.38 122.09 B: but um but a cat we we still might do we in fact have some friends who have hairless cats 

122.41 130.12 B: so i would yeah they're completely bald they've no hair on their body they look like these little monsters 

122.43 124.19 A: (( mhm hairless cats [mn] )) 

130.23 134.12 B: you'd probably look up on the web and get a good photo but 

133.89 136.30 A: [laughter] mm that's interesting 

136.01 138.80 B: yeah you haven't seen a hairless cat before 

138.28 141.23 A: no i've seen tailless cats 

141.42 143.56 B: no not tails they've got tails 

142.73 143.99 A: yeah 

143.73 153.39 B: they're just they just don't have any hair they're like skin they're like these wrinkled these wrinkly little they look like skeletons of cats almost and they're actually quite uh 

153.96 163.54 B: startling when you first see them when i first saw 'em i was kind of freaked out but uh after a while you get used to 'em and they're they're just like any other cat except they had to stay inside 

160.95 161.79 A: mhm 

162.87 169.18 A: how is that is that is that a breed a certain breed or is that do they come from a certain area 

168.68 172.03 B: it's a certain breed yeah i guess it's a genetic thing and uh 

171.41 172.07 A: (( uh-huh )) 

172.14 175.65 B: they've just managed to pinpoint that gene that 

176.03 183.69 B: doesn't produce hair and they just breed them they actually show them it's kind of a there's a whole like cult group of people who 

179.06 179.83 A: mm 

183.58 184.64 A: (( i can imagine )) 

183.76 185.62 B: have hairless cats so 

185.15 188.66 A: and those tailless -less cats there's uh 

188.79 196.38 A: they come from there's one island that's where they come from in uh the channel islands between great britain and france 

194.44 195.41 B: uh-huh 

196.63 198.94 B: so they're not cut 

196.70 200.99 A: and that that's no no they're not cut they're that's the way the way they're born 

200.77 201.65 B: huh 

201.54 213.80 A: yes the only that's the only uh species of that kind of cat that comes without tails i'm sure they cross breed them now or something but this is uh that was quite interesting to see that 

213.61 215.43 B: yeah that would be interesting 

215.13 223.01 A: so is there is there a particular reason why you want to get a a pet feel lonesome at night need a need a pet 

222.31 223.75 B: i'm sorry to get a 

223.64 233.23 A: [cough] i mean i do you feel lonesome at night so you need it [laughter] no i'm joking but i mean just i mean so what's the reason why would why do you like a pet 

226.33 228.21 B: [laughter] 

232.97 235.39 B: that's a good question um 

235.86 241.04 B: i think it kind of adds to the family environment i think um 

238.70 240.07 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

242.92 255.25 B: i think they're just kind of fun you know i don't i guess i'm not i guess my fiancee's more wanting a c- an an a pet and i think it's just because the sort of attention thing 

255.35 256.53 A: (( yeah but uh mm mhm but )) 

255.37 260.58 B: i i think she just really l- likes the personalities of cats in particular 

260.68 261.58 B: (( and )) 

261.96 264.59 B: would just like to have a cat to either 

265.12 268.55 B: yeah just to kind of like entertain her at night i don't know 

268.66 272.03 B: that's a good question though jurgen [laughter] i'll have to ask her 

270.69 278.82 A: i do you what like this of a what the reason i'm asking this is people get very very attached to their pets and uh 

278.99 286.67 A: my boss who also is a friend of mine um she uh her dog died um last week 

286.66 287.57 B: uh-huh 

287.30 290.65 A: it was devastating it was like a a person died 

290.79 293.35 A: and she was she cried all day 

293.56 297.06 A: it was it was incredible and uh 

297.65 298.69 A: i mean 

298.75 299.36 A: [sigh] 

299.98 313.59 A: so i guess that's that's so that's a good that's a good reason um to have a little bit more than just be a little bit more than a couple but not a real family so you know just there's a little bit of 

313.62 322.80 A: of uh responsibility involved but um you know don't you don't have to worry about things like school and college funds [laughter] and stuff 

316.21 318.06 B: mhm 

322.16 327.37 B: [laughter] well you know and anyways they gonna get a scholarship right 

322.97 324.21 A: [laughter] 

325.86 333.55 A: yeah [laughter] yeah but i mean that's that's uh a you know the interesting thing is that you know pets as uh 

333.82 340.12 A: as it turned out now that pets are very for for older people uh 

340.22 344.12 A: very thera- have very therapeut- -peutic um 

344.59 348.86 A: uh very therapeutic expect um um affect 

348.70 351.31 B: yeah i believe it yeah 

349.02 354.07 A: uh people who are i mean they they did test people who were 

354.38 355.86 A: you know t- um 

356.39 365.29 A: in a hospital practically for the rest of their lives there was not much cure or anything and they brought pets into their lives mostly dogs though 

365.36 370.93 A: um and that had a curing affect on people it's unbelievable 

370.96 372.13 B: (( interesting yeah )) 

371.17 371.99 A: um 

372.25 380.81 A: so that i mean from from that point of view i can uh i mean that's that's but a- if you don't have time and if you're not really 

380.86 388.36 A: ambitious about it like us um i think you know people shouldn't have pets but if you have like just like uh children i guess 

388.31 401.41 A: if you don't really if you have a child like you feel like you should have because you have a certain age or something is one thing but if you're really your heart is in it and that goes for pets too if your heart is in it by all means i i think i mean 

397.76 398.65 B: uh-huh 

401.48 411.95 A: there are people who are very much for pet now people were really really against pets um for a while i was against pets of course i mean what happened to my 

412.20 418.48 A: my wife who got attacked there was just i mean you know we every time we saw a dog on the street we just 

418.39 420.94 B: yeah what what kind of dog was it that attacked her 

420.10 424.16 A: there were two they weren't even big dogs they were like hunting dogs 

424.52 426.02 B: what kind of dogs 

425.38 426.90 A: hunting dogs 

426.91 429.53 B: oh like labradors 

427.46 428.36 A: yeah 

429.03 433.97 A: [sigh] i don't even know what breed it was two two dogs and they knocked her down 

431.63 432.29 B: (( mm )) 

434.22 445.48 A: and was i mean it was it was pretty bad and uh and uh you know there was it was really you know because my wife actually she they had she grew up with dogs and uh 

438.42 439.51 B: (( did )) 

444.26 445.18 B: uh-huh 

446.50 451.99 A: from that moment on it really that really much was it for her so um you know 

452.08 454.01 B: well that's too bad [sigh] 

453.11 466.02 A: yeah but i i think you know i think pets you know pets is a is a is a good thing um if you if you you know if you are into it there are so many pets out there without um 

454.34 455.90 B: it 

465.79 471.57 A: you know without masters so to speak i mean are do you thinking about adopting mm 

471.82 472.79 B: um 

473.33 476.30 B: yeah i think we i think we would probably adopt 

476.36 477.68 B: (( we tried a )) 

477.84 482.17 B: we we try to recycle as much as possible whenever possible and so 

482.45 485.15 B: um i think it would probably 

485.28 489.02 B: we'd probably end up going to a shelter and getting a cat 

488.23 495.02 A: yes that's that's i i think that's that's that's that's good um that's just somebody that that put him to sleep i 

492.54 494.28 B: yeah 

495.07 499.57 A: i used to work in television and we put a piece together once for uh 

500.30 509.69 A: for a show it was about what happens to you know all these animals that are found or animals that no one wants and they're just sitting there in those shelters and uh 

510.09 516.88 A: it was we went to a couple of shelters and uh did some research and and uh 

517.24 518.52 A: it was 

518.94 521.94 A: [sigh] you know it was pretty bad i mean there they 

521.76 536.53 A: there was like a couple of dogs they had to put to sleep 'cause there were just not there was just not enough room they didn't know what to do with them and they had this shack behind the the shelter where there was like it was in the summer when we shot this 

528.92 530.39 B: yeah 

536.58 539.15 A: and the smell and everything i mean it was like 

540.01 546.77 A: it it's [sigh] i don't i couldn't help it it was like really really poo i mean i don't know it was 

543.68 544.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

547.35 553.61 A: like a s- [sigh] i mean imagine you know they were putting animals to sleep there it was like and they put a sleep dog to sleep 

553.84 567.47 A: um there was s- scheduled was put to sleep the next day but you know because we were there they wanted to demonstrate to us you know show us how the whole thing goes but i don't want to [laughter] put a sour note on your [laughter] i was 

562.91 563.86 B: (( oh )) 

566.36 569.42 B: yes you were going to make me go out tonight and get a cat 

568.72 572.71 A: yeah yeah i mean that's [laughter] 

569.78 572.19 B: (( [laughter] )) 

572.13 580.38 B: well i was down in south america and uh they didn't have shelters and they didn't put dogs asleep but they were everywhere 

576.68 577.97 A: yeah 

579.75 580.84 A: (( yup )) 

580.24 590.72 B: and um i mean it was really there were more dogs than people and people who had pets it was you know maybe a a small percentage of people were 

584.41 585.44 A: yeah 

590.79 599.89 B: pretty wealthy and they had huge houses and they treated their animals pretty nicely but probably ninety nine percent of the population just kind of treated dogs and
