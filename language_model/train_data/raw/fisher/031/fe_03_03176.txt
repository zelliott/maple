28.48 38.40 B: oh they live anywhere from seven to fifteen years the longest yeah the longest i've ever had one of these sweet little birdies is probably nine and a half years

42.18 43.31 A: my

45.01 49.73 B: well every once in a while i will let them out and um 

50.29 55.65 B: they'll run around and play and nibble on my ear and stuff like that 

54.84 56.46 A: really 

55.82 58.12 B: and how long have you had your cat 

57.37 63.48 A: well um i have one cat left i used to breed siamese cats 

63.53 65.99 A: and at one time i had four 

65.73 66.88 B: mhm 

66.26 68.48 A: and now we're down to one 

68.87 69.86 B: (( uh-huh )) 

69.36 77.11 A: um i had one male and three females and i had to get rid of the male because i don't know how much you know about cats but um 

77.38 81.47 A: he wasn't handling being in an all female household very well 

81.13 82.22 B: mm 

81.79 83.66 A: so um 

84.11 87.31 A: we gave him away and then we had three females 

87.35 92.59 A: and about um oh i don't now a couple of years ago a year and a half ago we lost two of them 

92.76 94.65 B: mm sorry to hear that 

93.08 94.86 A: so that left only one 

95.64 98.36 A: and that's the only one i have left now 

98.11 99.11 B: uh-huh 

98.73 104.18 A: um but ah she's um she did a total turn around 

104.32 113.84 A: she was my cat that didn't want to have anything to do with anybody she was sort of just there and after she was the only cat now she doesn't leave me alone 

108.25 109.24 B: (( hm )) 

114.12 115.24 B: mhm 

114.61 116.74 A: so it's pretty interesting [laughter] 

116.11 121.37 B: yeah do you find that ah that your cats have different personalities and stuff 

119.90 121.89 A: oh absolutely they do 

121.75 125.72 B: same thing with my birdies i have had ah 

123.30 124.51 A: really 

125.75 130.56 B: i have had birds that have absolutely done the equivalent of snuggling up to me 

130.31 131.75 A: really 

131.28 140.99 B: and then i've had birds that have been very much afraid of me so it runs the extreme from percival and demetri who are absolutely sweet to me 

141.13 147.68 B: and poor little garret who is absolutely afraid of me and uh bit me every chance he could get 

146.50 147.42 A: huh 

147.72 149.06 B: but um 

149.09 157.71 A: yeah it's the same with cats they ah they develop their own personalities and they will change personalities as they get older 

157.62 158.78 B: mhm 

158.22 160.68 A: um like this one did 

161.15 168.07 A: she was a totally non affectionate cat and she went from that to being very affectionate 

168.20 169.26 B: mhm 

168.58 172.05 A: when there weren't any other cats in the household 

171.45 175.20 B: mm you think it makes a difference that ah a cat that 

175.42 179.14 B: i mean a cat that's all alone will grow onto their owner 

178.80 190.19 A: i think so especially siamese i don't know if you know anything about siamese but they tend to be one people cats and they'll attach themselves to one person in the household 

189.59 190.81 B: mhm 

190.49 200.29 A: and um there's two of us who live here and each of the other cats had attached themselves to one of us and then there was not really a person for her 

200.13 201.64 B: oh 

201.02 203.61 A: so once the other two were gone 

204.14 206.82 A: she attached herself to me 

206.78 210.83 B: oh yeah the funny thing about parakeets too is that um 

211.03 217.63 B: parakeets um tend to include human beings in their in their flocks so you have 

218.03 222.75 B: so you've got i mean at one time i had seven parakeets in the house 

222.59 223.46 A: uh-huh 

223.12 235.25 B: in different cages and stuff and they used to sing back and forth to each other and stuff and when i came home they were happy birds they could sing and stuff and when i had the t._v. on some of them serenaded me and fought with the t._v. 

235.12 239.31 B: 'cause ah the minute a parakeet hears a noise it wants to join in 

239.24 240.66 A: oh really 

239.40 241.33 B: [laughter] but um 

241.03 242.83 A: they don't talk do they 

242.20 243.33 B: (( well )) 

243.17 244.38 A: not not like 

243.18 254.98 B: i think the closest they ever get the closest my birds ever came to talking was galahad said percival once [laughter] which was the name of ah one of my other birds and he 

250.47 251.41 A: hm 

254.84 260.74 B: he said percival as plain as day probably about a year after percival passed away 

260.51 261.39 A: hm 

261.39 262.64 B: so um 

263.20 264.88 B: so i said what did you say 

264.95 275.93 B: galahad percival percival [laughter] but he never really said another he never really said another word again and the other strange thing was i had little demetri sitting on my shoulder 

276.12 277.89 B: and um 

279.00 289.52 B: and i was talking to the other birds while demetri was just sitting there as pretty as you please talking to all the other birds all of a sudden i hear his sweet little voice in my ear dimetri 

290.74 293.48 B: as in you're supposed to talk to me too 

293.45 294.16 A: (( [laughter] )) 

294.25 302.79 B: but i don't think demetri ever said another thing if you have more than one bird in the house the birds tend to talk to each other and they burble 

301.48 302.39 A: uh-huh 

303.89 308.10 B: (( oh yeah and )) 

308.19 308.98 B: (( the )) 

310.23 311.21 B: (( birds )) 

312.06 314.47 A: and they really do communicate with each other though 

315.93 324.49 B: will let me know when they need something though it was percival that taught me to check the water bottle to make sure that it worked 

325.44 334.69 B: yeah 'cause percy would because the way that percy taught me that those water bottles do get gummed up sometimes was to stand there by the water bottle rather mournfully 

334.18 335.54 A: [laughter] 

334.78 340.80 B: and kind of point towards the water bottle and i'm like what's the matter percy doesn't that work 

340.12 341.25 A: [laughter] 

340.73 352.77 B: and so i um i double checked to make sure that the valve valve was running and lo and behold there had developed a vacuum and as soon as i fixed it percy was extremely grateful and started drinking 

353.64 354.68 A: wow 

353.87 359.45 B: and stuff like that so i owe learning about those water bottles to percival 

358.92 361.87 A: [laughter] they get their point across i guess huh 

361.58 370.80 B: oh yeah and they let me know in other ways i mean percival also told me in so many motions that he did not like bananas 

362.42 363.84 A: that's pretty funny 

371.01 372.70 A: bananas 

372.15 373.62 B: oh yeah 

372.80 374.98 A: you feed them that kind of food 

374.34 388.31 B: well um it's a good idea to feed budgies ah fruit and vegetables as well as their seeds because if they have only seeds they will get fat and lazy just like anybody who sits around eating junk food all day 

380.29 381.44 A: really 

387.54 388.46 A: uh-huh 

389.01 398.27 B: but ah percy did not like bananas so he sat there in front of his dish whenever i mixed bananas in with his food and he would 

398.80 410.24 B: he would make a motion as if his little head was quivering and as if he was about to cry what percy you don't like bananas [laughter] so i never fed percy bananas again [laughter] 

409.26 410.75 A: [laughter] funny 

411.30 414.37 B: oh yeah they certainly are funny [laughter] 

413.79 417.12 A: have you ever had any other kind of birds or just 

416.11 428.96 B: well just budgies i'm thinking that um after i lose gawain and alexandra and may not be for a while i think i might get a senegal parrot because i think they're very cute or else i might get a cockatiel 

428.83 435.25 B: but i love galahad no i love gawain and alexandra and i hope they live for a for a while yet 

428.83 429.65 A: (( oh )) 

434.55 435.69 A: (( hm )) 

435.82 436.78 A: (( what what )) 

436.80 442.06 A: do i mean do you have to have special vets to take care of them or does does any vet 

440.49 452.90 B: veterinarians well they do have such a thing as an avian veterinarian who knows about birdie diseases which is a good idea and they get certified by the association of avian veterinarians and stuff and 

447.16 448.04 A: uh-huh 

453.71 457.76 B: i mean when it comes to administering medicine to a little birdie 

458.01 461.64 B: you you have to know just how little to give them 

461.48 463.42 A: mm i would imagine 

463.30 467.15 B: have you ever ah taken your ah cats to the veterinarian 

466.79 468.68 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

468.03 469.59 B: (( yeah do )) 

470.05 470.82 B: (( you )) 

470.09 473.74 A: yeah i go to a vet that treats only cats 

473.16 475.96 B: that treats only cats oh yeah 

474.26 480.43 A: yeah yeah she um she was in a regular general veterinary practice at one time 

480.40 490.53 A: and she really preferred cats and she when she went out on her own she realized that it's pretty traumatic for cats to be taken to a vet where there's dogs barking and 

489.29 491.77 B: mhm oh yeah 

490.50 499.89 A: you know it's traumatic enough for them to go anyways but it makes it even worse when there is you know other animals so 

498.01 499.21 B: oh yeah 

500.37 502.76 A: um she treats only cats 

502.67 507.38 B: oh that's reassuring it's nice to have a specialist veterinarian 

504.07 505.32 A: yeah 

506.43 516.24 A: yeah and i she i know i have a we have a mutual friend who has a dog that she treats sort of incognito she makes her come in the back door 

515.67 517.41 B: [laughter] 

516.78 526.45 A: [laughter] to to see her because um she doesn't want anybody really to know that she'll treat a dog because that's sort of what she's based her 

523.39 524.37 B: uh-huh 

526.87 533.14 A: you know her advertising on and stuff so people go to her yeah yeah 

530.42 532.49 B: she is a cat specialist 

532.61 540.44 B: my avian veterinarian will treat dogs and cats and other animals but she really loves the birdies 

540.29 541.69 A: mhm 

540.98 546.05 B: and stuff and whenever whenever she's established a relationship with a 

546.27 552.64 B: with somebody that owns birds she will make a special effort to see birds that are having trouble 

552.86 559.23 B: which is really good i mean i was able to get poor little alexandra in for her arthritis 

558.82 560.03 A: oh dear 

560.22 574.46 B: oh yeah she had she has arthritis in one claw and basically because my veterinarian has had experience with birds with arthrit- with arthritis she owned a bird with arthritis at one time 

564.89 565.64 A: (( mm )) 

574.46 580.06 B: she was able to tell me some very good advice as to what to do for alexandra 

580.22 581.02 A: hm 

581.09 584.07 B: and that helps doesn't it sweetie 

584.25 586.23 A: um claws are 

586.33 588.87 A: what are they made of like cartilage 

588.32 589.80 B: (( well um i )) 

589.87 590.81 B: mean 

590.94 596.87 B: yeah bird claws are are feet pretty much and then they grow the 

597.05 599.01 B: they grow the claws like
