75.47 88.20 B: i mean they're they're ah ah basically they they the eat kind of what we eat other than you know they do kind of intermix with the regular dog food but [mn] for the most part they eat what we eat

125.99 127.25 A: mhm 

126.62 128.03 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

128.29 132.12 B: and they're i- i'd say we probably spend 

132.21 144.66 B: [mn] just about every waking moment that we have other than just doing regular household chores of mowing the yard ah clean the house grabbing groceries they pretty much get our full attention 

145.20 151.94 A: [mn] ah your when you take your dogs for a walk do they ah do they heel pretty good are they they run around or 

145.67 146.45 B: so 

151.28 160.44 B: no they're very very good ah as a matter of fact our neighbors have constantly commented that we're very fortunate to have three dogs that are that don't fight um 

152.77 153.67 A: (( no kidding )) 

154.14 154.70 A: (( [cough] )) 

159.50 161.06 A: [laughter] 

160.39 174.17 B: they they it's kind of funny the little girl i mean and i guess she's probably the smallest of all of 'em but she's a spitfire and they respect her for it um she walks in the middle and the other two boys they walk on the outside so it's really kind of interesting 

174.08 183.75 B: when when they all walk together they have to walk just this way i mean little girl's gotta be in the middle all the time she's not happy boys gotta be on the outside that's just the way it is 

177.55 179.00 A: [laughter] 

183.46 185.97 A: so they have their own little personalities then huh 

185.56 188.14 B: very much so and

210.32 211.46 A: right 

213.79 218.23 B: i really didn't think i'd like 'em and they're probably my favorites 

218.31 231.00 B: [mn] so the little girl especially i mean i just i i guess it's just hard for me to comprehend that this little girl with it's little mouth and little little everything just little miniature sized everything is just is is my little girl 

224.76 226.18 A: (( [mn] hm )) 

231.37 240.39 B: and ah as a matter of fact my wi- [mn] my wife constantly makes comments to to everybody that um she's wrapped around my i i've i'm wrapped around her little finger 

240.66 242.61 B: [mn] so it's really kinda neat 

242.50 250.14 A: um ah i know my grandma and grandpa they were ah pretty attached to a a labrador retriever that they had [cough] and um [lipsmack] 

250.22 259.15 A: i guess that it had died a few years back and they were both pretty torn up about it um you know 'cause they felt like that was one of their kids do you feel the same way about your dogs [mn] 

258.65 269.87 B: absolutely absolutely as a matter of fact whenever they are sick as a ma- well for example yesterday the little girl was was not feeling none too good and [mn] babied to no end ah you know of course 

261.12 261.68 A: (( [cough] )) 

269.83 283.26 B: them being as old as they are it really bothers us whenever they do get sick [mn] um the the chow um has arthritis really bad it's just very characteristic of a chow they're they they do have a lot of structural problems 

282.10 283.91 A: (( [cough] mhm )) 

283.27 297.36 B: and he was coochy cooed to no end on saturday i mean we gave him aspirin i put him up in bed with me we we laid down in the afternoon and probably for about four hours and he woke up like a new boy 

297.11 298.26 A: (( huh )) 

297.66 300.69 B: and ah so yeah it it really does 

300.47 313.14 B: we- we've talked about it you know the what ifs it's gonna happen we know it's gonna happen they're getting old [mn] and it would just it will tear us up i know that and and rena that's my wife is very very much prepared for it to happen too 

312.58 314.93 A: and she feels the same way too i suppose huh 

313.99 322.13 B: absolutely to no end and um it's kind of funny though my dog who when they first met um 

315.09 315.87 A: (( right )) 

322.30 329.71 B: she he really wanted to tear her up [mn] i mean he's you know he's got the sharpei attitude that nobody is going to be 

329.95 339.61 B: coming into our territory and my very first night of taking her out on a date my dog really wanted to tear into her i had him outside and he wanted to come through that window in a heartbeat 

331.21 332.88 A: [laughter] 

338.97 340.56 A: [laughter] 

339.82 346.16 B: and now they are the best of friends as a matter of fact he can she can actually 

342.89 344.07 A: no kidding 

345.32 345.88 A: (( [cough] )) 

346.28 357.91 B: kind of i i don't know how you want to describe it he can she can get him all wrapped up in the blankets and he can she can pretty much mould him the way she wants to mould him and he just loves it to death 

357.38 359.19 A: [laughter] no kidding 

358.44 372.96 B: so it just it's really it's kind of funny [mn] you people seeing what we do with our poochies and you know they they're you know they they say the same thing they're your kids you can tell that so i mean i i wouldn't have it any other way 

368.26 369.03 A: (( mm )) 

372.87 374.21 B: i really wouldn't [mn] 

374.42 388.65 A: [mn] i know ah me me and my wife were talking about um getting a dog and we're also talking about having a baby and i was like well you know what dogs are you got to take care of them a lot i was like they're even it's almost just like having a kid so my wife's thinking about having a baby first 

374.46 375.33 B: and 

388.78 393.42 B: yeah well there's a thing about having of kids and then then w- having kids and 

393.22 406.10 B: after having a pet you have to be real careful that they are they they feel threatened once you have a kid a- after having a dog they feel that they're they're being infringed on as far as territory 

395.95 397.85 A: (( but [noise] )) 

399.36 400.28 A: mhm 

405.59 406.35 A: (( mm )) 

406.41 412.34 B: so and that's what we're always told and it's like well not a problem we just won't have kids i mean and that solves that problem 

411.80 414.10 A: [laughter] [noise] 

412.52 422.71 B: [laughter] so [mn] well you know the thing about it is that having we we tell people is with with having dogs you don't have to worry about them asking you for the car keys they don't ask for an allowance 

418.36 419.63 A: (( [cough] [laughter] [noise] )) 

422.61 436.93 B: they they don't bring home a [mn] a female that you don't appreciate or you don't like um they don't go out and get preg- they don't get pregnant and um you know they you don't have to worry abut a college a college scholarship for 'em 

436.96 441.11 B: so all they ask for is a little bit of food a little bit of water and lots of love 

440.78 441.95 A: [laughter] 

441.19 456.09 B: that's all they ask for [mn] so that's not asking for a whole lot in all honesty i mean in you know you clean up the yard after they've done their numbers you know when you the yard and [mn] it's like you think about it that's not a whole lot you know not not like like like a child would 

444.43 446.13 A: no kidding [noise] 

455.53 456.94 A: right 

456.31 464.86 B: and it what's nice about having kids or ha- i mean having i mean i'm sorry having dogs is [mn] you can put 'em in a kennel whenever you go on vacation 

464.71 475.58 B: which i mean we we might take a a a week or two vacation a year you don't have to worry about finding baby sitters for 'em they don't they don't basically infringe on your vacation you just put 'em in the kennels 

473.99 474.91 A: mhm 

475.43 484.70 B: and they're good so that's kind of the nice thing about it you know they we we just basically if we we want to take o- take off for a vacation this week 

476.25 477.65 A: (( yeah )) 

484.75 492.53 B: not a problem find a kennel i m- um well we have a kennel but [mn] you know you find a good kennel and you put 'em in it and they're fine 

492.24 493.12 A: (( hm )) 

492.88 502.66 B: [mn] so i and we're we're us having kids ever having kids and having pets there- there's a huge difference and [mn] i think we've got the best of all worlds 

502.26 515.40 A: definitely yeah and um [cough] my dad he had ah about seven dogs when i was growing up and ah they were all labs and um ah black labs yellow labs and and ah 

508.61 510.01 B: oh wow 

515.55 526.68 A: there's one other one i think isn't there ah white labs i guess are the same as yellow i don't know but um he had ah um like seven dogs and he had a bunch of kennels built on the side of our our garage 

519.89 520.84 B: right 

526.87 528.46 A: [cough] and um 

528.47 534.51 A: he he loved those dogs to death he went outside with them every day and and ah anyways 

534.53 541.72 A: um one evening when we were eating lunch um we smelt smoke outside and the the side of the the barn was on fire 

541.88 549.39 A: [mn] and ah i guess one of the heat lamps from like rabbits he had in there had caught the hay on fire that he keeps in the kennels 

545.59 546.57 B: right 

548.57 549.93 B: oh wow 

549.37 559.92 A: [cough] so anyways um i think like four out of the seven dogs ended up dying and and ah a f- a few of 'em ended up with real bad burns and stuff like that but i remember my dad was 

553.77 555.22 B: oh man 

559.69 571.07 A: so torn up that he actually cussed god out for a second which which was the the first time i had ever heard of something like that and you know for my dad being a really you know big christian man or whatever 

563.85 564.99 B: really 

570.50 571.65 B: right 

571.05 575.65 A: and ah just because he was so torn up about it 'cause it was that big of a loss to him 

575.66 583.92 A: [cough] but i just remember he was so torn up for for quite a while and ah eventually you know he apologized to god and whatever [laughter] so 

583.65 585.10 B: oh my word 

584.02 592.70 A: but yeah that was a a pretty big experience i remember that like it was yesterday just because you know it had such an emotional impact on my dad [lipsmack] but 

591.96 594.54 B: did you have a lot of dogs growing up as kids 

594.02 596.76 A: oh yeah all all the time [mn] 

596.95 599.89 A: yeah and i i loved 'em they were they were great d-
