56.10 57.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

56.59 70.88 A: and ah there's pr- it didn't help a lot because it turns out they didn't go ahead and get 'em fixed so i've got two cats you know thinking i was doing some good but there's still a load more out there but i'm not taking any more i'll tell you that [laughter] oh out in jersey where do you live

76.80 80.52 B: so how much ah how much time do you spend each day with your cats 

80.11 93.34 A: oh not enough i'm working all day probably just a good hour and a half two hours in with them when i get home from work and ah you know ah i see 'em for fifteen minutes in the morning when i'm feeding 'em and giving 'em clean water and that kind of thing i'm sure they'd rather i was home the whole day 

93.34 94.35 B: sure 

94.33 102.49 A: so ah they're a little bit ah poorly adjusted animals because i'm not around a lot they're kind of freaky when they love me but anybody else comes over theyre they're scared so ah i 

102.80 103.88 A: haven't i haven't 

102.82 104.19 B: what are their names 

104.21 107.88 A: [mn] i actually named them kelvin and hobbs after the comic book 

106.65 108.24 B: (( kelvin and hobbs )) 

109.62 110.77 B: (( [laughter] th- )) 

109.70 122.29 A: yeah that that used to fit their personality 'cause kelvin was a real crazy kitten but ah he's a real scaredy now so i w- i would probably rename them now if i had the choice but i don't i don't really know what i'd name them maybe charlie brown and lucy or something i don't know 

122.07 123.80 B: are they male or female 

123.89 128.88 A: ah well they're both neutered now so they're nothing but they were they were brother and sister 

128.28 129.40 B: oh i see 

129.35 131.01 A: yeah yeah so 

131.03 136.36 B: ah what ah what are they a certain type just your average cat 

136.13 143.75 A: they're just they're just tabby cats the grey and black ones you know th- they look like the cat on the cat food ah cat food bag [mn] you know [mn] 

143.19 144.53 B: sure sure 

143.92 156.17 A: just plain old mutts but ah yeah they're a lot of fun you know but ah i would imagine i would imagine out in nebraska you got a lot more room out there for dogs and you know to run around and that kind of thing 

145.71 146.52 B: huh 

149.38 150.43 B: oh yeah 

155.70 161.11 B: oh yeah yeah that's the one thing we do have ah we've got the corner on room that's for s-

161.15 162.19 B: yeah 

162.39 164.50 A: yeah well i've i've only been 

162.39 164.95 B: so we've cornered the market excuse me 

164.90 179.09 A: yeah yeah we we have some room out here in certain places my neighborhood certainly not you know for cats it's just they're nice and quiet they kind of take care of themselves for the most part i think if i had a dog and spent only an hour a day with the dog the dog would have a real problem so ah 

179.03 180.91 A: [laughter] 

180.13 183.18 B: yeah the the the dog was definitely a 

183.26 192.25 B: he definitely consumed a lot of your time but boy it was a labor of love and when he when he was finally gone you know just oh boy he le- he sure leaves a hole in the family you know 

190.04 191.87 A: yeah 

192.13 195.17 A: i can imagine do you have do you have a lot of kids or 

194.60 195.82 B: ah just one 

195.59 199.52 A: oh okay so they they your child obviously was probably real close to the dog too 

199.23 201.22 B: yeah very close 

200.09 203.85 A: yeah that's that's hard do you have any pl- oh i'm sorry go ahead mm 

201.39 202.20 B: (( ah )) 

203.23 208.46 B: yeah i mean it was very you know ah the dog was there when she was born and you know that's all she knew 

208.50 209.82 A: (( yeah )) 

209.17 211.99 B: so she was definitely definitely bummed 

211.74 214.74 A: do you have any plans to get another dog 

214.49 224.84 B: ah well i'm kind of in the same situation you are i'm in an apartment right now so you know i'd sure like to some ah some day but ah just not really permitting right now 

224.80 231.81 A: yeah yeah i can see that i can understand that yeah next time i have a dog i'm not sure what ki- what kind of dog did you have anyway 

231.40 233.23 B: (( ah it was a vizsla ))

475.95 488.45 A: my ah my friend's got a real spoiled cat he eats you know table food and it like turns his nose up at different brands of food i said i don't have that problem i just give 'em you know a couple of bowls of this stuff a day and some water and they're they're pretty easy they're low maintenance 

487.49 488.78 B: (( go )) 

488.77 494.31 A: yeah i like that about 'em they're indoors only so unfortunately i got a litter box to clean every day but ah 

494.36 500.88 A: you know it'd be nice to have a trained outdoor cat just to go outside and you know take a dump and then come back in but ah 

501.74 506.48 B: yeah no kidding i've got a friend that's got one of those automatic things that ah 

506.56 509.41 B: you know scoops the cat's poop as soon as it goes 

509.00 515.60 A: [laughter] yeah i- i've seen those things i'm always thinking the cat's going to get his leg caught in it or something though i- it it worries me 

510.38 510.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

514.10 516.28 B: yeah that that thing'll take off 

516.80 518.62 B: [mn] what the hell is that

524.30 525.69 B: yeah no kidding 

525.46 534.88 A: but ah yeah that's real funny i've seen those i've thought about it believe me 'cause ah when you have to go and change that litter box with two cats you have to do it every day so it's it's not that 

533.50 535.43 B: oh i'm sure of that 

535.05 537.71 A: it's probably my least favorite chore but ah 

538.02 542.33 A: you know like you say it's a labor of love you take care of 'em and they take care of you somehow
