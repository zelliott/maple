125.49 126.91 B: oh really oh 

127.38 135.42 A: there's one that actually likes to come inside and run through the house and rub against everything and claw the carpet a little and 

132.73 133.80 B: [laughter] 

134.72 136.09 B: yeah 

135.43 139.89 A: that's when it's time for him to leave is when he starts clawing the carpet [laughter] 

137.95 139.33 B: [laughter] 

139.61 152.58 B: yeah my wife uh feels real sorry for cats huh she brings 'em whatever she could [laughter] we probably got four right now that are permanent and one dog i'm more of a dog person myself

152.60 160.50 A: uh ye- i i like dogs i just i they were uh both my girlfriend and i are allergic and it now there's there's not as many 

158.07 159.29 B: oh really 

160.54 166.42 A: i don't think there's as many stray dogs around that you [noise] that you feed kibble to or something like that [laughter] and never 

164.60 165.83 B: [laughter] 

166.72 170.66 A: and we've already got the cats coming so i don't know if it'll work out well 

168.60 169.56 B: uh-huh 

170.12 173.86 B: yeah well our dogs and cats get along great together you know they don't 

172.93 174.82 A: oh that what what breeds are they 

174.93 175.93 A: are your dog 

175.01 177.12 B: uh we've got a collie 

176.77 178.41 A: oh wow 

177.27 178.64 B: and uh 

179.00 193.08 B: right now we've got short haired cats i guess but my wife had persians for a while but that was a hassle uh their birth rate is very low when you breed 'em and she tried that and she got all broken hearted she couldn't take it any more 

181.22 182.20 A: (( yeah right )) 

188.55 189.84 A: mhm 

192.45 193.63 A: [laughter] 

193.24 196.50 B: out of the whole litter maybe one or two survived out of seven or eight 

196.08 200.18 A: oh that would just be awful i couldn't i couldn't do that either 

199.40 203.27 B: yeah i couldn't either [laughter] my wife's even worse than i am so 

200.60 201.97 A: (( yeah )) 

202.70 204.46 A: (( yeah i know )) 

203.68 210.01 B: but i like dogs the dogs don't bother me except when i got to go out and feed 'em once in a while [laughter] so 

207.38 208.25 A: yeah 

208.93 211.30 A: yes well one thing i like 

210.10 213.00 B: but they get along they get along great together no problem 

211.96 222.53 A: oh that's good that's good yeah one thing about the dogs compared to the cats is the cats apparently find a place to do their business and i don't know where it is which works out well for me but with dogs i have a i 

213.55 214.43 B: yeah 

222.82 225.26 A: i don't know maybe dogs they're just different dogs but 

225.29 233.54 A: all the dogs i know always do it right you know in the yard or somewhere and i'd just hate going out and cleaning up after 'em so i i don't know that i do want uh dogs but 

231.95 238.29 B: yeah well we got uh a little walk alongside the house that we had a um uh 

239.36 241.93 B: sewer put in for her and just wash it away 

241.80 243.23 A: oh wow 

242.86 248.43 B: yeah we had the house redone quite a bit so we put that in it was a good deal [laughter] 

247.10 251.78 A: yeah well that that does sound [laughter] like maybe think about getting a dog [laughter] 

250.68 254.97 B: and the dog loves it you know it goes right there and he'll get a little treat and he's happy so 

254.40 258.07 A: wow that no that sounds great i hadn't thought about that so some 

256.12 261.49 B: yeah that's the worst that's the worst part of having a dog is letting 'em loose in the backyard [laughter] 

260.59 261.65 A: [laughter] 

261.56 265.20 B: well we've got a couple of acres so it's got plenty of room anyway but 

261.91 262.81 A: well that 

264.63 273.79 A: oh that's that's yeah we've just got a you know normal sized lot with a little backyard and a little bit of front yard and a little walkways down the sides and 

271.42 272.98 B: (( mm )) 

273.23 278.47 B: i used to live in chicago next door to everybody and huh this is a world of difference i love it out here 

278.15 284.38 A: oh yeah yeah that's we we want to move out to uh you know pretty much anywhere with some more space but 

278.98 279.89 B: yeah 

284.58 292.29 A: uh right now this is a good enough deal because she's just buying it directly from her dad so we don't even have to go through bank interest or anything and 

289.39 290.93 B: oh uh-huh 

292.23 295.33 B: and now is the time for a mortgage though if you're going to buy a place really 

294.60 296.88 A: oh that's true [laughter] 

295.76 298.27 B: uh it'll never be this low again [laughter] 

297.49 302.23 A: [laughter] it's hard to beat zero percent interest rate though [laughter] 

300.88 306.71 B: [laughter] yeah my brother just refinanced he got four and a quarter i think out michigan so 

306.11 308.09 A: yeah well that's not bad at all 

307.51 315.64 B: but his wife's going goofy she wants to buy a third house [laughter] they've got a big place in chicago and they've got a a weekend place in michigan now she's 

309.98 311.23 A: (( [laughter] )) 

312.50 313.43 A: yeah 

315.86 326.28 B: she's a nut anyway she can just spend money she wants a third place so it's right off the water so [laughter] but there's only two of them so [laughter] how much space do you really need 

317.19 318.12 A: wow 

320.62 322.69 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

323.21 324.36 A: [laughter] 

325.74 331.61 A: uh yeah you got find how are you going to find time to fill all those houses [laughter] yeah i 

330.75 339.05 B: my brother works a lot but he just ignores her you know he don't really like her too much i'm surprised they're still together he just buys her what she wants and goes his own way 

334.08 335.08 A: yeah 

335.64 337.12 A: yeah yeah 

338.89 342.64 A: that's yeah that's that's one way to do it i guess for folks 

339.35 340.12 B: (( uh )) 

341.69 346.93 B: yeah it's not for me but he's [sigh] he's sort of wimpy [laughter] so 

345.16 346.08 A: [laughter] 

346.55 349.87 A: so uh i guess it asked how much time do you 

349.90 352.25 A: each day do you spend with your pets or 

352.18 361.91 B: uh well when i get home from work the dog comes charging for me and i got to pet him for a while and that but the cats are well they do what they want to [laughter] 

356.65 357.48 A: yeah 

357.51 358.72 A: yeah 

361.16 364.12 A: yeah that's that's my experience with cats too is 

364.27 370.01 A: yeah they i usually have to spend five minutes a day petting 'em or something like that but that's about it the rest of the time 

368.55 373.80 B: yeah they're real finicky they do what they want to do if they feel like being friendly they'll come right up to you and you know 

373.98 380.84 B: sometimes when i'm reading the paper or a book or something they'll come and bother me jump on a book and you know [laughter] 'til they get their way and then they walk away 

378.67 379.62 A: yeah 

380.51 385.83 A: yeah exactly they they just kind of leave you alone after that if they're not interested 

382.02 383.13 B: (( but uh )) 

386.18 397.67 B: yeah i we got uh trouble with the computer when i'm on the computer or my like wife or daughter they jump up there they walk on the keyboard they gotta have their you know they they feel like they gotta be the center of attraction i guess 

388.95 390.21 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

397.11 398.75 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

397.83 400.24 B: (( they're right in front of you all the time [laughter] )) 

400.37 414.00 A: i uh i understand that they get right up there and kind of want to put their face in whatever you're reading and and their paws yep i know all about that i had a when i was growing up too at my parent's house we had cats and they uh 

400.39 401.14 B: (( so )) 

406.14 407.77 B: yeah exactly 

409.11 409.93 B: yeah 

413.18 414.20 B: (( uh-huh )) 

414.10 420.19 A: they used to like to chase our feet if we were wearing socks and claw 'em and try and you know nibble on 'em and stuff and 

417.02 418.43 B: [laughter] 

419.20 421.00 B: yeah exactly the same thing 

420.82 421.88 A: (( yeah i )) 

421.95 435.15 B: i can't wiggle my toe if i'm laying on the couch relaxing and i wiggle my toe they'll come charging over [laughter] yeah the worst part's the hair but the but the short hair is not bad at all when we had persians it was unbelievable [laughter] 

424.68 427.92 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

431.95 433.88 A: no that's that's definitely true 

434.60 435.83 A: yeah 

435.81 442.09 B: and then if you don't you know clean 'em every so often brush them constantly they get all matted up and take 'em in and there's 

440.94 441.70 A: (( [sigh] )) 

442.12 446.34 B: quite a bill fifty to sixty dollars to have them shaved and you know 

445.77 447.35 A: (( oh jeeze )) 

446.49 450.23 B: fixed up they're beautiful cats but jesus huh 

447.41 448.78 A: (( they have i don't know ))

451.81 452.91 B: yeah 

452.58 455.69 A: the upkeep on those cats is terrible but i tell you 

454.91 466.74 B: i know even for dogs now they they're crazy my brother's got a psychiatrist for his and a a heart specialist it's an older it's an older dog it's uh a little chihuahua like

470.33 471.09 A: (( huh [sigh] oh )) 

473.31 482.41 B: and it's so old now it's real old in doggy years but uh they've got all kinds of medication for him and the it's like a real person even worse probably 

481.74 485.10 A: yeah it's getting to be quite a real industry 

484.48 487.43 B: yeah it's a i think it's a racket myself but 

486.75 489.70 A: (( [laughter] right [laughter] yes )) 

488.59 491.34 B: he charges worse than a regular doctor for 

490.68 495.54 A: if he although if you're on the receiving end of the money it's probably [laughter] a great business 

494.86 498.39 B: it [laughter] uh how's the weather by you out there 

497.82 504.58 A: oh it's actually been nice the last day or two um we get on and off rain this time of year it it'll be you 

504.70 511.55 A: know almost seventy one day or seventy or so and then next day there'll be a high like fifty five with some rain and just kind of alternating 

511.30 520.06 B: yeah we're we're about the same thing now we've had a cold spell for a long time now it's sort of broken uh our highs around seventy and a low of about forty five or fifty at night 

519.36 528.99 A: yeah that's that's right around what we get usually we we get some days where the temperature variation between the high and the low is only like five degrees it's like fifty at night and fifty five during the day 

521.50 522.42 B: uh-huh 

526.12 527.01 B: oh 

529.80 530.58 B: yeah 

529.83 532.33 A: (( yeah it's it's just pretty moderate )) 

530.90 534.95 B: i sort of like it like fifty five or sixty wish it would stay that way all year but you know huh 

534.71 543.88 A: nah [laughter] uh you probably get it worse than we do here at that usually most of the winter it's about forty degrees or forty five or fifty somewhere in there 

543.16 544.57 B: really that's all 

544.20 552.07 A: yeah it's it's it's not that cold we we get maybe one day of snow worth an inch or two each year if that [laughter] it 

548.61 553.23 B: [laughter] wow [laughter] i didn't realize that that's great though 

552.28 560.07 A: yeah yeah it's well it's certainly a different climate and it makes me enjoy the snow when you see it instead of dreading it and having to worry about shoveling it 

558.39 559.50 B: right 

559.78 561.61 B: or driving in it [laughter] 

560.96 571.94 A: yeah that's true that's t- well then of course nobody around here knows how to drive in the snow at all and just panics and people just don't go to work usually and 

565.51 566.86 B: [laughter] 

568.35 569.26 B: yeah 

570.68 573.66 B: i'm an accountant and we got a client in uh georgia

576.82 578.78 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

579.27 584.95 B: and it snowed about an inch to two inches tops the whole city just closed down 

584.92 586.92 A: [laughter] 

585.67 590.63 B: nobody could drive in it there was [laughter] there were so many accidents it was unbelievable 

587.08 587.98 A: [laughter] 

590.02 599.89 A: yeah yeah uh we get that i mean we get people who go along in the snow like it's no thing and just nothing there and just speed right along and all of a sudden they're up on 

596.76 598.07 B: [laughter]
