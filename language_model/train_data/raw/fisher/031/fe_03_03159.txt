245.10 247.52 B: (( uh i'm just thinking aloud yeah i )) 

248.22 254.06 A: uh i guess so i guess in order to get the ten dollars you need like 

253.80 255.97 B: (( have have a have a i have a question for you )) 

256.08 257.04 A: uh-huh 

256.46 260.69 B: why why do you um why do think this whole study came about 

260.90 262.29 A: (( why do i what )) 

262.43 269.77 B: what do you think this what do you think this whole this conversation this uh these phone conversations are all about what do you think the the a._t. why do you think it came about 

269.60 270.95 A: (( uh )) 

271.70 277.69 A: to be honest i really don't know i guess there are people maybe either studying psychology or studying speech 

274.81 276.76 B: (( uh i don't know i don't )) 

277.43 282.59 B: last ti- last time they called me i mean they called me on sunday and 

282.86 287.47 B: i was saying hello and they called me and they they gave me the whole intro 

287.86 288.94 A: right 

288.29 295.53 B: (( and and so they told me to introduce myself and i introduced introduced myself and there was no one on the other line [noise] there was no one on the other end however um )) 

295.59 302.57 B: i think this is a study to see how people communicate well with one another do you think so you know when new people meet on the phone 

302.71 305.23 B: (( it could mean like a different connec- connection sort of )) 

304.40 313.11 A: yeah 'cause they said like usually the conversation is about like you want something like a pizza or some insurance you know 

311.80 312.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

313.20 314.13 B: okay 

313.78 319.55 A: but uh and now i guess they just give they're just giving people different topics to see how they converse with each other 

318.96 326.91 B: yeah i know but they ask people i think they i think they ask them on the survey when you sign up if you have pets and i told them i didn't i think i told them i don't 

327.09 333.51 B: so um i don't know why they can't just conversations on these kind of topics the topic of pets which i don't have 

333.63 337.36 A: let me let me ask you a question why do you think people have pets 

335.47 336.33 B: (( uh go ahead )) 

337.74 341.64 B: (( why do i think people have them honestly i think people have pets because )) 

338.12 339.35 A: (( i you )) 

341.83 343.07 B: they are 

343.50 345.20 B: either lonesome 

345.40 346.80 A: [laughter] 

345.47 347.74 B: and they want they want they want company 

347.67 348.67 A: uh-huh 

348.10 351.38 B: o- or um 

352.23 359.01 B: well it all boils down to the one thing the fact that not that they're lonesome necessarily but the fact that they want company do you understand and the 

358.12 362.17 A: yeah so they enjoy the company of of animals 

359.54 368.68 B: fact that they want to feel they want and they want to feel sort of they want to feel sort of a responsibility that they uh they have a responsibility for someone other for some for something else 

368.99 375.96 B: and therefore they have a pet to take care of and um if they're late to feed it the pet gets pissed off et 

376.19 377.07 B: cetera 

376.48 382.59 A: i- i have a friend like that she has a pet and she said she one of the reasons she got it is because 

382.73 392.03 A: she was lonely and she needed some company and every time i talk to her she she tells me what the cat is doing and i really don't care what the cat's [laughter] doing 

390.94 392.85 B: [laughter] 

392.06 397.29 A: i really don't care that it drank out of the toilet or it jumped into the curtains you know 

397.24 401.36 B: i understand what you're saying i i totally understand where you're coming from 

401.24 403.95 A: i i enjoy the fact that um 

403.87 405.54 B: why did you get a pet 

405.26 409.25 A: i have a hamster i enjoy the fact that i feed the hamster 

406.81 407.50 B: (( why [noise] )) 

409.40 414.42 A: and take it out of the cage when i want to when i wanna play with the hamster 

414.41 428.58 A: and and you know aside from that all he does is uh run on the wheel and he's a really good sport about um getting picked up i had another hamster that that would bite all the time 

428.76 432.73 B: so one so but why did you get it initially to feel a responsibility correct 

433.77 434.93 A: um 

434.97 449.35 A: well this is how we got him was uh we spent some time with some friends in new york and it was it was a dorm room and they weren't allowed to have pets and we just we just played with the hamster and we kind of fell in love with him and we liked him a lot 

443.21 444.11 B: okay 

449.34 458.04 A: so we took him home and they had to get they had to get rid of the hamster and they didn't know how they were going to get rid of it but so we took him back to miami 

457.48 458.52 B: (( that's nice )) 

458.37 460.17 A: and now we have 

459.92 462.08 B: (( so now you have it now the hamster has you )) 

462.32 464.11 A: (( mhm )) 

463.49 464.99 B: (( that's that's interesting ))
