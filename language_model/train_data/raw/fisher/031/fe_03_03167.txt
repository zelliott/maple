101.11 114.99 A: a week after she had gotten this pet she still hadn't taken it to the vet and it had like ear mites and we had other pets around and i was like you know you need to take this pet to the vet and she's like nah i can't you know and i don't have time so i say well i'm going to take her she goes well if you take her she's yours and i was like okay whatever i'll take her 

114.95 122.12 A: so i took her and she had to get you know ear mites and this that and the other thing it cost me a fortune at the vet i was in college i didn't have any money anyway well 

122.45 134.11 A: so a week after i got her all of a sudden she disappeared and i was at work one night i was waitressing college i was at work and um they called me and said ah rags is back and she had been gone for a week and i was like oh no no like 

133.93 137.61 A: yeah and it looks as if she might have been hit by a car and i was like oh great 

136.76 137.91 B: gone 

137.78 148.25 A: so [laughter] i went home and i ended up having to take her to like the emergency vet because of course it was a sunday night whatever cost me i don't know how much okay so chi-ching chi-ching put it on my credit card and that's fine 

148.05 155.28 A: well i moved out of that house and moved into another house and unfortunately i was at work again one night and my new room mate called and said 

155.74 163.81 A: i knew it was bad news when he called because you know we were just friends were weren't you know he would never call me at work or anything and he called me and it was like i'm really sorry but i just ran over your cat 

163.80 169.27 A: and i was like all right you know whatever so i called the vet though told them don't even bother with the xrays she's not going to make it 

169.06 183.76 A: so i went the next morning first thing and the cat was like he had run over basically one side of her and like her pallet was split down the top and the bottom and one of her leg oh well it's very it's i mean it gets kind of funny she was fine this cat was 

177.60 179.67 B: oh no stop 

183.60 194.31 A: up i mean it was just the next morning and she was totally swollen but she was up and purring and like rubbing on my hands 'cause i was like all right i don't care how much it costs just fix her up chi-ching chi-ching and i get out my credit card 

189.85 191.08 B: oh god 

194.27 201.25 A: well this cat when she was done they did the best they could but they had to like wire her jaws and it was stuck 

200.88 202.10 B: oh no

204.05 205.20 B: (( uh-huh )) 

204.85 213.16 A: no and so at first i had to syringe feed her until she could figure out i'm not kidding you like six months i had to grind up her food and feed her with the syringe 

208.44 209.34 B: oh 

212.78 214.32 B: oh my god 

213.09 222.27 A: every day and um then when she could start eating i still had to keep you know i had to like take her cat food puree it and put it in a bowl and since she couldn't open or close her mouth 

222.19 228.39 A: she would just stick her face in it and kind of like lap it up a little bit and then sh- she would get it in her nose she'd go ah choo 

228.59 234.88 A: and she would get cat food all over the entire house okay so you want to know how much time i spent taking care of that pet 

234.54 236.59 B: [laughter]
