129.43 131.86 B: l- like a guard dog or something that'd be cool 

132.30 139.51 A: yeah i i've thought about getting a dog as a as a companion because i see i'm going to be living alone for [noise] you know for the indefinite future 

139.12 140.26 B: yeah 

139.71 145.69 A: and you know you know you're going to have girlfriends whatever but i don't i'm not planning on having any of them living with me 

145.09 147.11 B: yeah that's a good point 

146.60 148.96 A: so like a dog would be 

148.97 150.43 A: would be i guess 

150.92 154.52 A: i'm not sure i'm not sure but one thing that stops me 

154.74 156.42 A: is the fact that [noise] dogs 

156.74 159.14 A: (( don't like their life span is so short )) 

158.90 160.19 B: yeah 

159.64 165.01 A: and so it's like i know that he's going to have to be put down before [noise] before you know

178.52 188.44 B: well we gotta walk him three times a day which is another like that's the thing that's a pain about dogs they have to be taken outside you know especially if you live in the city 'cause like we live in brooklyn so 

185.23 186.07 A: right 

188.52 194.15 B: we have to walk him like a lot [laughter] so tough like we always gotta be home and stuff

331.70 332.98 B: yeah 

333.56 342.78 A: it was it's the worst because [noise] dogs hate you because you have to go up to people's houses [noise] and put papers in their thing or you have to knock on the door and collect money

366.15 374.10 A: it's the ci- it's the city right beside toronto but i spent a lot of time in toronto 'cause i have family there but mississauga is is is it's all a city 

373.50 374.75 B: yeah 

374.18 378.67 A: (( like toronto mississauga brampton uh scarborough )) 

379.14 381.38 A: (( etobicoke have you heard of those ))

384.49 386.86 B: (( that all went to school over there )) 

386.70 390.48 A: [noise] mississauga's like almost part of the greater toronto area [noise] 

390.06 391.98 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

391.62 395.65 A: but if i'm talking to somebody who is you know hasn't been to ontario [noise] 

395.75 400.18 B: mhm well i know toronto i just don't know mississau- mars- mississauga 

396.05 397.07 A: (( i just say ))

404.95 407.54 B: yeah yeah yeah 

405.94 408.14 A: (( know it's all right there [sigh] )) 

407.93 409.11 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

409.29 413.07 A: and so uh yes i used to get attacked by dogs so 

413.46 423.59 A: for the longest i was just scared of dogs like i'm st- i'm not scared of dogs any more but i don't talk to strange dogs like some people walk down the street and they'll just they'll see a nice dog oh your dog is so cute you know 

418.19 419.39 B: mhm 

423.25 424.30 B: yeah 

423.90 434.16 A: but i don't do that i if if someone i know has a dog it's all good if i've got to visit somebody and they have a dog it's all good but i don't i don't mess with dogs i don't know 

433.82 438.45 B: yeah but i mean whatever it wouldn't stop you from getting one though right 

438.45 439.67 A: yeah i don't think so 

438.56 442.66 B: because i mean you gotta as long as you train a dog to like you then it's all good 

443.42 444.22 B: (( um )) 

444.33 449.44 B: i don't know i kind of like i kind of like the dogs all the scary dogs with the pit bulls and stuff

450.95 453.58 B: (( well i mean like if i had one that'd be pretty cool )) 

453.02 455.05 A: (( [noise] yes 'cause they're very loyal )) 

454.54 456.76 B: yeah and they're cool looking dogs too 

456.24 457.26 A: [laughter] 

456.84 459.72 B: they're crazy but they have they've a lot of energy and stuff 

459.92 461.95 A: [noise] you've got to know how to control them 

461.46 462.88 B: yeah 

462.16 467.87 A: [noise] i read that like breeding dogs and and dogs that are real aggressive should never be your first dog 

467.27 471.91 B: yeah i know these guys i think you've got to treat her right though 

468.40 470.49 A: yeah i read this um 

472.24 477.14 A: oh yeah definitely but i heard like they're alpha dogs meaning like 

477.33 483.06 A: i guess in the canine species [noise] they're the dogs who are used to being the leaders of the pack and they're real aggressive 

482.70 484.04 B: (( yeah )) 

483.09 485.29 A: (( and they not ordinary dogs like )) 

485.52 487.74 A: they don't get along well with any other dogs 

487.49 488.89 B: (( yeah i hear you )) 

488.62 491.79 A: and it's like if you're if you're the type of owner who 

492.33 506.72 A: who doesn't know how to take control of the dog the dog ends up owning you i mean like the dog sleeps where he wants the dog eats where he wants and shits where he wants all of that like if it gets to the point where this is all just from shit i read and it gets to the point where um 

495.41 496.79 B: mhm 

501.23 502.31 B: yeah 

504.60 505.81 B: yeah 

506.72 511.15 A: like if you not do - if you do something that the dog doesn't like the dog will growl at you 

511.34 512.58 B: (( really )) 

512.03 514.89 A: or it bites you and that's your own dog and it's like 

513.73 516.95 B: and this is this is only certain types of dogs oh right 

516.09 522.27 A: yeah these are the alpha male dogs [noise] dogs like um dobermans [noise] pit bulls [noise] 

522.57 536.05 A: like huskies [noise] dogs are the real dogs that are not necessarily aggressive but they have a lot of energy [noise] and they you know what i'm saying [noise] of course [noise] another characteristic of these dogs is [noise] they don't get along well with any other dogs like some dogs 

523.99 524.86 B: yeah 

527.83 528.77 B: yeah 

535.95 539.06 A: if you're just walking your dog down the street and it sees another dog 

538.45 540.01 B: yeah 

539.32 545.18 A: like it'll get along with that dog they'll be intrusive of each other but they won't necessarily dislike each other 

544.75 546.01 B: (( uh-huh the )) 

545.31 549.68 A: but there are some dogs that dislike all other species of dogs like 

548.54 549.85 B: (( alpha male )) 

550.29 551.23 A: (( what was that )) 

550.39 552.28 B: (( the alpha dogs or something like that )) 

551.60 556.57 A: yeah like they don't like any other dogs any other dog they see is like a threat to their territory [noise] or 

556.18 557.70 B: mhm 

557.29 558.76 A: (( some shit like that i don't know )) 

558.30 559.97 B: (( yeah it's really crazy )) 

560.76 563.02 B: (( now i don't know about you but you've learned that in school )) 

563.48 564.46 A: (( [noise] um )) 

564.66 569.84 A: this is when i was researching dogs i was like thinking about what type of dog i would i would like i might like to buy 

569.22 570.54 B: oh yeah yeah 

569.93 573.09 A: and i went through a lot of different [noise] like websites about canines 

572.50 573.79 B: yeah 

573.27 586.38 A: and a couple of 'em was like you know trying to give advice on what kind of dog to buy and what what you're looking for in a dog and if you're looking for this type of dog if you're looking for like a family pet then you want to look at these dogs if you're looking for a guard dog then 

580.01 580.92 B: yeah 

586.38 589.59 A: (( you want to look at these species and they just broke down [noise] ))
