16.24 22.26 A: ohio geography as i could be my aun- my aunt lives in muskingham county is that anywhere near columbus 

21.93 23.25 B: i have no idea 

22.91 28.73 A: okay [laughter] that's all right what yeah it's a bigger state than than you than you think only been through there once 

23.50 24.88 B: big help huh 

27.12 35.70 B: [noise] actually i'm i'm just um here i'm a traveling nurse home's north carolina so i don't know much about this area so do you have any pets 

32.31 33.55 A: oh really 

35.22 38.12 A: i [laughter] i did when i was a kid 

37.64 38.72 B: [laughter] 

37.96 51.27 A: i this is i of all the topics man you know this is the one that's not necessarily the hottest issue with me [noise] i like 'em i just everybody in my family loves 'em they we're just all pretty intensely allergic so we don't get the chance to spend as much time around 'em as we uh as we ought 

50.89 53.46 B: well i have three lovely cats here 

53.07 55.69 A: really what uh what kinds 

56.38 57.53 B: mutts 

57.44 61.50 A: that's beautiful man [laughter] that was the kind of dog that i had when i was a kid too 

58.89 60.14 B: [laughter] 

61.12 61.74 B: (( [laughter] )) 

61.77 67.23 A: and it's this i just there's something something a little bit more earnest and easy to like about an animal like that 

66.64 72.37 B: yeah actually i well i know for sure one of 'em came from the humane society 

72.05 72.93 A: (( really )) 

72.96 74.72 A: a reclamation project 

74.78 78.59 B: yeah just a you know one of those please take me home 

78.43 86.59 A: that's i mean what [noise] it's the one my father really wanted to get a dog recently he'd been told by his doctor that he was no longer allergic 

86.71 96.19 A: and i think mostly because he wanted to believe it and was so because there was any convincing reason to believe that after a lifetime of being allergic to dogs that he would all of a sudden stop 

89.05 90.62 B: uh-huh well 

96.11 102.70 A: the first place he went was the pound to look for him and he found one that he you know obviously fell in love with and he brought my mom and they liked it too and then 

102.72 106.91 A: then they both got like hives and started sneezing and couldn't handle it any more 

104.20 107.66 B: uh-huh so the allergy was short lived 

107.23 114.90 A: yes so how much time do you spend with your with your pets three cats is a lot of uh it's a lot of attention to distribute there 

110.85 111.93 B: um well 

114.31 122.92 B: well fortunately um you don't have that much with with cats they're pretty self sufficient it's not like uh a dog we did have a did have a dog but 

119.21 120.06 A: mhm 

123.10 129.09 B: it was also one of a a pound rescue but she kept escaping from the yard 

127.96 128.71 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

128.92 129.94 A: [laughter] 

129.54 130.75 B: so um 

130.79 134.73 B: finally sh- actually shipped her to a friend in baltimore 

134.56 135.48 A: (( really )) 

135.22 138.19 B: who has a nice fenced in area that can keep her so 

138.16 139.39 A: yeah 

138.54 140.00 B: [mn] but i don't 

140.49 143.61 B: you know probably on the average of the day an hour with them 

143.51 144.56 A: mhm 

143.93 148.61 B: because you know cats if they want to be bothered with you they want to be bothered with you if they don't [mn] 

148.71 157.37 A: [noise] i think that's what that seems to be the way they the thing that cat people like the most about them my family's always been dog people but cats just seem like they're smart enough to entertain themselves they're 

157.17 162.02 B: [noise] yeah they just i mean if they don't to be bothered with you you're not going to change their mind 

158.02 159.01 A: (( the most uh [noise] )) 

161.35 171.12 A: yeah and that's i mean part of me has always been a little frightened by that i guess i like dogs because they're so dumb that they i mean they always seem happy to see you [laughter] like they always want to play 

170.98 173.92 B: right cats just want to see you around mealtime 

173.52 179.29 A: yeah and for the most of the rest of the time they want to be left alone to think about whatever it is they think about and 

178.63 181.09 B: yeah well i'd love to know what that is 

179.94 191.94 A: [laughter] but yeah they there's always something i don't know maybe it's just the way i was i was uh the way my mom has a real problem with cats but like there always seems something sinister about 'em they just seem smarter than uh 

192.44 194.63 A: than maybe they they they ought to be yeah 

193.18 196.26 B: well they're just they're just aloof they just don't really care 

194.85 196.35 A: (( mm )) 

197.17 201.57 A: so out of curiosity and i know we're off topic here um 

199.59 200.93 B: yeah well fine 

201.83 209.44 A: how did you get involved with this i've been asking everybody and i'm just kind of amazed at how many different people there are i've been getting these calls for like the third night in a row 

209.09 214.54 B: actually a friend of mine emailed me and said here check this out 

209.45 210.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

214.57 216.11 B: so i did 

215.12 217.37 A: is this the first one you've done or have you 

217.55 222.57 B: no this is the first one i called you can i just found out tonight that you can make the calls yourself 

222.08 223.08 A: oh really 

222.78 227.99 B: um in the email they sent it's got a toll free number that you can initiate a call 

228.04 239.94 B: so um i was busy at the time that i had selected which was like two o'clock in the afternoon and my roommate i sent it to her and she's gotten a call two nights in a row and i said wait a minute 

239.44 240.29 A: (( [noise] )) 

240.22 242.61 B: i'm not getting anything and here you're getting them 

242.37 243.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah that's )) 

242.82 244.64 B: (( i'm going to change my time )) 

244.34 249.06 A: [noise] yeah that's what i haven't and it's funny though 'cause there's so many people out there that want uh 

249.23 251.83 A: to talk it seems like and i mean 'cause this is 

251.86 257.31 A: [noise] like i i set it up you know i said that i'd be available like any night during the week around this time and like 

257.60 265.25 A: for the most part like [noise] every night of the week around this time somebody's calling there sometimes did you set the topic or was that them or 

260.39 261.43 B: [laughter] 

264.62 266.69 B: no they set the topic 

266.02 268.45 A: [noise] i sort of wondered where that came from 

267.82 277.19 B: actually yeah um my roommate who looked it up she said they had a lot of several different topics and um she hit they she got sports last night which 

276.38 278.26 A: yeah i got sports last night too 

277.18 282.88 B: which i would have loved to have gotten because i like sports but the day before [noise] i got the war in iraq which was [noise] 

282.01 296.23 A: yeah i got i got one about uh weapons inspections and i was really kind of kind of nervous about that one just because i mean it's different when you talk about pets it's like we're not going to get into a passionate argument about do- whether dogs or cats are better 

285.03 286.29 B: yeah 

295.62 296.68 B: right 

296.42 309.34 A: but like there's a lot of people i wouldn't want to talk to about that issue you know like and just i mean not because i mean i've heard the the points of view but it's like that's a really serious thing i mean so far i've talked about sports reality t._v. and pets which is fine 

309.08 310.08 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

309.34 317.61 A: and then the war in iraq one was just like i was a little jittery about it i've generally gotten pretty good feelings from these and i've enjoyed 'em you know and i don't want to have a 

317.34 318.95 B: how long have you been doing it 

318.34 329.27 A: you know an argument this is uh this is my third or fourth one but only for like i haven't even been doing it a week yet they've just [laughter] seems like every night that i said that i would be able to receive calls i've gotten something 

321.33 322.37 B: (( uh i )) 

329.87 333.94 A: but yeah what it what was the war in iraq one like out of curiosity 

333.28 338.88 B: yeah well i i i don't know i talked to this woman in new york and she was a little difficult to understand but 

338.50 339.51 A: oh really it 

338.91 343.74 B: um i don't know just basically the same as as these i guess just you know 

344.38 346.24 B: saying what you thought about it 

345.98 350.77 A: wasn't really i i just sort of worry about 'em getting real intense and i know 'cause there's a lot of people that 

350.13 354.30 B: well it didn't so i think you can probably control that you know yourself 

353.89 365.03 A: that's a good thing yeah the sports one was enjoyable but this is i wounded up talking about sports the first time anyway and we were supposed to talk about reality t._v. so neither i nor the girl that was i was talking to had ever really watched any of the shows 

365.15 370.70 B: oh i i haven't just a just a few we better get back on the get on back on the pets here [laughter] 

370.02 371.13 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

371.30 373.10 A: (( [laughter] better yeah )) 

372.45 377.87 B: so what yeah i know i've i've pretty much been all my life with pets of some sort 

377.44 383.43 A: yeah i wish so w- would you i mean with these uh with the dos or cats when you were growing up 

378.23 379.23 B: but 

383.53 385.38 B: d- d- dogs when i was growing up 

384.82 389.19 A: mhm and yeah when did you make the uh when did you make the switch over [noise] 

389.03 390.19 B: um 

390.48 392.12 B: in fact i had 

392.22 394.86 B: both up until about three years ago 

394.60 395.94 A: mhm 

395.67 396.95 B: (( [cough] yeah [noise] )) 

397.37 401.09 A: yeah i had a dog when i was growing up that i loved very much but it got 

401.38 407.82 A: it was the sort of irrepressible mutt [laughter] that my parents picked up when i was uh when i was a kid and then they it 

408.12 420.84 A: wound up i don't know it got it got sick um later in my life and like not actually i was still really young but it got it got sick and he was i think he was quite old but it had never really been fully healthy anyhow 

414.02 414.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

420.91 424.58 A: and it was it was really sad for me it was the first real experience of 

423.96 425.93 B: it it is difficult 

425.79 428.40 A: i mean and i was like five you know and i didn't really 

428.59 434.48 A: i think understand all of what was going on and it was you know it's hard when the first thing that you're 

434.72 440.10 A: experiencing that over is that it's something that you know you love so unconditionally and seems so blameless 

439.50 440.96 B: exactly 

440.36 441.57 A: you know but 

441.76 443.54 A: it was a he was a good dog there's some 

443.58 454.76 A: some really good pictures from my youth apparently my parents threatened to break out some day the one they have of the dog clamped on to one end of a rawhide bone and me at like three clamped on to the other end of it 

452.37 453.30 B: [laughter] 

454.03 456.59 B: like the coppertone baby [laughter] 

455.14 458.82 A: yeah i really i don't need to see that picture man that's like [laughter] 

457.26 458.85 B: [laughter] 

458.92 464.45 A: there's a lot of people out there that um i'm sure would get way too much enjoyment out of seeing me have me in that picture 

462.78 464.25 B: [laughter] 

464.54 470.92 A: and i i don't know but i i definitely i feel like it was it was a good in terms of like you know for when you're growing up like 

471.05 475.27 A: there's not really a formative experience i think that teaches kids [sigh] like better 

475.38 478.23 B: no it's it's really a good experience 

475.76 479.30 A: sense of values or respect for it yeah and i mean just 

479.78 480.89 A: (( yeah it's )) 

479.87 484.78 B: and they really are taught and that's another thing i like about cats when i started to travel in my job 

485.01 493.11 B: my hours were varied so cats are like i said self-sufficient you can go off and leave them for three days you put 'em down enough food and enough water 

486.74 487.91 A: (( [noise] )) 

490.54 491.70 A: mhm 

493.23 495.57 B: and you're all set you can't leave a dog 

494.99 501.85 A: yeah i have you know what i have right now actually i guess i was thinking about this in terms of pets i have these two little baby turtles now 

501.91 503.29 B: oh really 

502.58 512.64 A: yeah and i guess i always think of when i think of pets i think of cats or dogs but i really i really like those guys a lot i got 'em i- in new york city down in uh in chinatown 

512.19 513.24 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

512.53 523.21 A: there's these guys that sell the the little tur- they're like maybe the size of a silver dollar when you first get 'em and he gives you two of 'em in a little tank and some little turtle feeding pellets and like god knows what they're 

523.12 532.06 A: you know doing with the turtles if they don't sell 'em or whatever but the uh so i picked those up it was like ten bucks for the two of them and i've had them for almost a year now 

531.49 534.38 B: oh th- those are pets what are their names 

533.75 544.26 A: they're uh well one's named la bradford and one's named la varre they're both named after basketball players [laughter] of of my youth that i enjoyed watching but they're they're terrific they don't really do very much 

544.26 545.87 B: no well [laughter] 

544.32 556.39 A: i wish um their their brains are probably too small for them to really recognize me it's sort of hurtful to recognize that you know like every day when i feed them they seem a little afraid and like sooner or later i just want them to to realize that i 

556.42 557.86 A: you know like them 

557.87 563.76 A: [laughter] and i'm not going to try to eat them or something like that but they seem they seem confused about that sometimes 

563.17 567.55 B: i think sometimes it would just be lovely to be inside a animal's head 

566.84 571.84 A: oh yeah they're 'cause these animals too like i remember a friend telling me one time she had a uh 

567.65 568.46 B: (( just to )) 

572.11 580.86 A: she had a siamese fighting fish and if you had those by themselves they're you know very docile and they're apparently incredibly stupid like even by fish standards 

580.87 589.07 A: and she says that like i was like isn't it hard for it being in 'cause it was in a really strangely shaped tank and she was like what i was told is that every five seconds they forget what they're doing 

588.71 589.59 B: huh 

589.12 599.85 A: so that like it's can be it can be like swimming around and be like where am i hey i'm in a tank and then it just like where am i oh i'm in a tank and then like it just sort of loops back and forth at it all over and over again it 

592.44 593.46 B: [laughter] 

599.49 599.89 B: (( well ))
