116.89 125.27 B: yeah i got her when i i lived alone for a while and didn't live in the best neighborhood so i thought getting a dog would be a good idea and 

120.21 121.28 A: yeah 

124.67 126.27 A: yeah yeah that makes sense 

125.67 132.96 B: yeah and then after as soon as i got her i guess she spent pretty much every day every almost every minute with me so

161.75 162.99 A: (( [laughter] )) 

162.76 168.98 B: my mother has a cocker spaniel so she was bigger than their dogs you know the day i brought her home [laughter]

168.42 169.66 A: yeah 

169.00 170.04 B: yeah 

170.38 174.47 B: yeah she's she's definitely the best best thing i ever got so 

170.53 171.36 A: well 

174.43 181.20 A: yeah i going uh going to say if you didn't have her you'd miss her um uh miss having a dog i'm sure yeah 

179.34 184.13 B: oh yeah she's she's very protective of me and 

183.89 184.67 A: (( so )) 

184.23 185.78 B: a good companion 

185.35 186.90 A: you live alone then huh 

186.40 190.34 B: well i did actually i just got married um this past summer 

189.85 191.15 A: (( oh i see )) 

190.40 195.02 B: so but she she loves my husband and she really for the most part hates men 

194.77 196.28 A: (( oh is that right [laughter] )) 

195.55 199.09 B: yeah she always hated men like wouldn't let 'em in the house and 

197.01 197.92 A: (( isn't that )) 

198.36 200.69 A: that strange how do you figure that 

200.10 201.29 B: uh huh 

200.98 204.08 A: i said h- h- how can you figure that why is that 

203.35 211.21 B: i i don't know she was always um you know if someone new would come to the house if it was if it was a woman she didn't seem to have too much of a problem 

210.88 211.72 A: (( yeah )) 

211.08 222.63 B: but if a man was ever knocking on the door she you know was very you know didn't want to let him in the house and you know would you know kind of growl at him if they came near me and that kind of thing she's just very protective 

222.31 223.65 A: yeah 

223.07 228.72 B: when it came to men but the very first time she met my husband uh she never barked at him once 

228.65 229.45 A: (( never )) 

229.20 243.86 B: so no so i guess that was she's only done that with very few men so i guess that was a sign [laughter] but i yeah i actually acquired a stepson too and she's uh very protective of everyone in the family so 

230.07 230.81 A: huh 

233.13 234.42 A: yeah yeah 

235.35 236.85 A: yeah i guess 

236.91 237.90 A: (( [laughter] )) 

243.02 245.64 A: yeah well that's good 

244.62 249.23 B: yeah she's a real i guess the shepherds are supposed to be real family dogs so 

249.46 253.30 A: do you have to have it on a on a leash out there they probably have a leash law don't they 

252.72 260.32 B: um there well there's a leash law but uh see i don't put her on a leash usually uh she's she's very clingy so 

260.38 265.25 B: she you know she'd never run away she wouldn't go more than you know twenty feet away from me 

261.94 263.16 A: (( no [noise] )) 

264.92 267.69 A: oh she'll respond to your calls and all that huh 

266.66 277.61 B: oh yeah yeah you couldn't get her to leave my side i think so [laughter] yeah that's one thing i never had to worry about was really keeping her on a real you know a leash a lot or anything 

271.49 272.61 A: [laughter] 

275.83 276.75 A: yeah 

277.82 281.83 B: if i walk her i do just so other people don't get intimidated but 

281.49 284.41 A: oh yeah yeah 

282.89 284.49 B: yeah she's a 

284.66 292.18 B: she's a big baby when it comes to us but when it comes to strangers you know you'd think she'd rip your arm off but 

292.97 296.87 B: she's a big baby [laughter] yeah big baby [laughter] 

293.06 293.68 A: (( [laughter] )) 

294.05 296.23 A: big baby [laughter] but 

296.77 299.82 A: got out got out of the uh diaper stage huh 

299.52 300.38 B: huh 

300.06 301.15 A: [laughter] 

300.57 302.10 B: (( out of oh it was out diaper )) 

301.79 304.95 A: i was just kidding [laughter] 

302.54 303.26 B: (( sta- )) 

304.23 309.34 B: [laughter] yeah i think she'll always be a baby when it comes to me 

308.09 311.53 A: so you prefer having your dog i gather from having a cat huh 

311.10 320.53 B: oh yeah i i never thought i mean i don't know i never really thought about it 'til i had a dog and it's a totally different world as far as having a pet 

320.29 321.41 A: yeah 

320.80 323.20 B: i don't think you can even compare the two 

323.07 323.98 A: (( so it )) 

323.23 330.83 B: when the siamese cat i had was great i mean she would you know she would greet you at the door and she was different than most cats you know 

330.38 331.55 A: yeah 

330.94 335.47 B: she was actually more like a dog but yeah having a dog is so different 

335.35 340.08 A: but this dog uh that you have now is the first dog ever that you've had [mn] 

339.76 342.09 B: yeah first dog i ever had of my own 

341.50 342.78 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

342.28 347.34 B: my parents have a dog but it's their dog you know so it's not really the same but 

344.60 345.43 A: yeah 

347.44 349.00 B: yeah she's uh 

348.66 353.35 A: so when the two uh come together are they good fr- do they get along well tog- together 

352.79 356.29 B: oh my mother's dog no my mother's dog hates her 

353.87 354.90 A: yeah 

356.01 357.34 A: oh is that right 

356.65 360.24 B: yeah well she's like ten or twelve i think so she's older 

359.78 361.02 A: oh yeah 

360.47 364.31 B: so you know my dog really i think just aggravates her [laughter] 

363.81 365.23 A: (( [laughter] )) 

365.10 370.21 B: always jumping around and all hyper you know that and she's such a little dog and my dog is so big 

367.15 368.04 A: yeah 

370.34 375.11 B: she kind of like tramples her and you know she plays likes to play rough so 

373.18 373.90 A: yeah 

374.44 376.16 A: yeah yeah 

375.38 377.92 B: i think my mother's dog hates that [laughter] 

378.02 381.70 A: was the subject we're supposed to talk about uh i didn't 

381.81 385.54 A: uh hear all of it did they give some sp- 

385.84 389.67 A: uh specific aspect we're supposed to supposed to talk about 

388.81 397.57 B: no it was just pets and do you have any i think was it was yeah it was actually very like a loose topic today i would say [laughter] 

391.88 393.49 A: oh i see or anything 

396.11 398.93 A: yeah is is is this your first call 

398.54 400.43 B: no this is actually my third

406.67 407.72 A: (( yeah )) 

407.13 416.45 B: which was great 'cause i got this really great guy that like loved sports so he did most of the talking [laughter] [laughter] 'cause i don't know i don't know much about sports so 

412.59 414.00 A: [laughter] is that right [laughter] 

414.60 415.46 A: no 

416.02 417.81 A: well he made it easy for you

418.87 422.19 A: (( [laughter] well very good )) 

422.25 427.16 A: uh i'm really trying to think what i could say about pets i don't have a whole lot to say [laughter] 

426.51 428.36 B: yeah you never had a dog 

428.64 432.66 A: well when i was growing up uh uh 

433.22 436.24 A: my my uncle which i 

436.42 442.02 A: we lived in a in a kind of a large family and he was part of the family and so he had a dog which 

442.12 449.41 A: technically was i guess as much my dog as his so yeah but uh as i 

445.14 446.08 B: right 

449.79 454.81 A: as i grew older and all i went went into the service and when i came back out i never 

455.74 460.09 A: got an animal 'til my wife got uh a cat uh you know uh 

460.11 462.75 A: quite a few years after i got out of the service 

462.21 463.18 B: uh-huh 

464.15 473.72 A: but uh well in fact we had i guess two cats one got got uh got killed uh we figure we don't know but we live out kind of in the country and think one of these

476.70 477.70 B: (( oh )) 

478.62 479.72 A: so 

479.57 485.99 B: yeah i haven't had the best of luck with cats actually most of most of the cats i've ever had my life have died so 

485.72 487.04 A: yeah 

486.33 491.71 B: the very first one i had when i was probably two or three died underneath the christmas tree

522.92 524.27 A: is that right 

523.69 526.84 B: yeah i i think every cat [laughter] i ever had 

525.72 528.97 A: you haven't had too much of uh a success with cats 

527.83 536.99 B: yeah i mean they've like all died that's why after i had the siamese i was really really attached to her and when she died of cancer i said that's it no more cats [laughter] 

529.89 530.75 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

536.77 538.20 A: no more cats
