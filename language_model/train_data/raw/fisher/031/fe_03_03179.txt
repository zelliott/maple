212.55 222.02 B: yeah when we were looked at houses we that was one of the stipulations was there can't have been any animals on the carpet and we still put new carpet in 

222.57 224.20 A: yeah 

223.50 225.36 B: 'cause you just can't get it clean 

226.82 228.73 B: had a turtle when i was little

229.77 231.63 B: it lived in our backyard 

232.19 238.08 B: and she went on and ate slugs and we planted a whole bunch of strawberries she loved those 

238.48 240.51 B: and then in the summer we'd feed her 

241.01 244.93 B: spinach and lettuce and melons and whatever else was thrown out 

246.46 248.34 B: but 

246.51 249.03 A: [noise] yeah i don't have time for a pet right now 

248.97 250.43 B: are you in college 

250.88 257.03 A: uh not right now i'm taking the semester off and like actually i'm taking about a year off i went for a semester 

253.44 254.29 B: uh-huh 

257.28 271.01 A: and i was living with my dad and then it i that didn't work so i moved out and now i'm just i'm working two jobs and everything and i'm trying to find another job and i don't really have time to take care of like something like a dog or a cat or something 

269.88 280.75 B: yeah i'd a friend that he shared a dog and a cat and between him and his neighbor and they could just go back and forth one of them fed the dog one fed the cat or something and 

280.73 281.48 A: (( huh )) 

280.77 285.63 B: and they had just had a whole in their fence and the animals did what they wanted and that way 

286.07 290.42 B: they didn't have to worry about them so much i'd like to do that share 

290.64 292.42 B: share the dog with somebody 

292.41 294.88 A: yeah that wouldn't be too bad 

293.45 296.42 B: 'cause our dog would love to have more attention 

297.31 299.93 B: and we've got two kids to play with him so 

299.91 306.71 A: yeah my mom's dogs they get they get all the attention they get plenty of attention though as she lives for them 

305.63 307.06 B: are they small dogs 

307.16 308.17 A: (( uh )) 

309.34 321.08 A: they're two two of them are kind of smaller like i don't know maybe twenty pounds and then there's like four of them are probably about forty 

314.45 316.27 B: uh-huh 

320.70 321.71 B: (( wow )) 

321.52 323.54 A: forty five pounds and then on of them 

322.40 326.42 B: my dog's fifty and i can't imagine him living in the house 

325.29 330.06 A: and then one of them's uh one of them's a german shepherd but that's that's the house dog one 

328.04 328.90 B: uh-huh 

329.81 331.08 B: yeah 

330.94 335.31 A: and she just i don't know she keeps she keeps saying she's not getting any more but she keeps getting more 

335.42 337.82 A: she stops she was going to stop at four but then 

337.70 352.03 A: like my uncle had one of them and he didn't want it any more and it was like the sister of one of the ones she had so she uh took that one and he had another dog that they didn't want any more so she took that one and then like she worked at vet clinic and there were dogs that these people were going to have put 

344.92 346.31 B: well she's kind of a 

349.73 350.60 B: uh-huh 

350.84 355.30 B: that's exactly what my mother in law did except she acquired cats 

353.35 354.40 A: huh they're 

355.73 356.74 A: yeah 

355.89 360.92 B: she would get them all from the vet people would bring them in and 

358.26 360.50 A: well there two they were going to put to sleep 

360.72 368.23 A: 'cause they couldn't breed 'em 'cause there was something wrong with them but they were fine i mean they were just going to put them to sleep because they weren't worth any money to them so she took those [laughter] 

362.02 362.94 B: uh-huh 

364.01 364.99 B: right 

367.58 371.57 B: right my uh mother in law took a cat because it was 

371.60 378.56 B: deaf or blind or i don't know what was wrong with it i think it was blind and they were going to put it to sleep 'cause they didn't want to deal with it 

375.39 376.32 A: yeah 

379.09 380.12 A: oh 

379.61 381.33 B: she ended up with that one 

382.91 388.23 B: and she promised me she wouldn't get any more cats after we got married but she's got four since then so 

388.15 388.96 A: [laughter] 

388.40 390.72 B: [laughter] i don't believe her 

394.27 397.44 A: so i've pretty much grown up with dogs i don't know i like 

397.96 402.17 A: my uncle had a cat i didn't really like it it was mean it was a siamese cat [sigh] and 

401.57 402.48 B: uh-huh 

402.87 405.85 A: it would always scratch you and i i don't know 

404.77 405.58 B: my 

406.17 410.32 B: there was this siamese cat just got real sick and that cat was like 

410.45 411.95 B: i mean it almost died 

412.38 415.44 B: i guess they can get really ill siamese can 

415.43 416.65 A: (( yeah mm )) 

416.07 419.83 B: i don't know why they're just not a very hardy breed i guess 

420.18 423.69 B: but it looks awful and this is a beautiful cat so 

423.73 425.80 A: yeah they are pretty 

424.25 426.22 B: but you can really tell the difference 

430.20 434.28 A: i kind of wish like i wish i kinda did have a pet i don't know 'cause like 

434.77 436.51 B: well it's something to look forward to 

436.47 437.90 A: yeah i like pets 

437.54 441.77 B: they say it's good practice for uh having kids and that's true 

441.13 442.83 A: yeah [laughter] 

443.82 446.42 B: definitely true one thing i have learned 

446.68 449.44 B: um with the dog we have now is 

449.52 452.21 B: it's worth it to buy decent food 

452.55 455.67 B: because you buy the cheap food it goes right through them 

453.04 453.90 A: (( yeah mm )) 

456.14 461.72 B: [laughter] so they eat more and you clean up after them more 

463.20 465.85 B: so that's what one convert 

466.11 467.76 B: i've managed to 

468.90 470.05 B: we buy 

470.21 473.08 B: expensive food you know from the vet or whatever 

472.94 474.60 A: yeah 

473.89 476.88 B: and i i think it really ends up better in the long run 

478.35 479.82 A: that makes sense 

479.44 480.36 B: yeah 

480.15 486.11 A: i think kids uh i think kids should have pets cause i i i think it helps to teach responsibility and everything 

486.03 490.95 B: my older son he when he was born they thought he might be autistic 

491.03 491.89 A: yeah 

491.14 495.48 B: and his doctor actually said the fact that we had a dog 

495.76 496.77 B: it can 

496.89 501.59 B: probably did a lot of the bringing him out of the characteristics he had 

501.69 502.48 A: (( mm )) 

502.16 506.62 B: he said that that that that's what having a pet is one of the things they use to 

507.21 512.08 B: uh to develop those personalities you know the traits 

511.59 513.35 A: yeah 

513.03 516.58 B: so i thought that was interesting that the doctor actually said it 

516.95 521.21 A: yeah 'cause i guess it's it's just easier to get along the pet i mean [noise] 

521.04 521.99 B: yeah 

521.75 522.82 A: 'cause they're not 

522.87 526.40 A: uh they don't really judge you too much or anything you know it can't 

526.77 528.62 B: yeah 

527.47 529.88 A: really be that intimidating either um 

530.12 533.72 B: yeah my next door neighbor has three rottweilers and 

534.78 536.78 B: and they don't get a lot of attention 

536.91 537.79 A: oh 

537.39 543.54 B: and so they beg for attention when kids go by and then the kids are scared to death of them 'cause they're so scary looking 

543.83 544.71 A: oh 

544.75 546.22 B: it's so bad for them 

546.88 552.07 A: yes i lived in a house with some of my friends and their parents they bred they bred uh 

552.62 554.14 A: bulldogs 

553.97 554.83 B: uh-huh 

555.74 557.11 A: (( and they were um )) 

557.59 560.78 A: they was always they were always really friendly little dogs 

560.23 563.16 B: yeah my our dog he kind of looks like a 

563.73 564.88 B: a uh 

565.87 566.85 B: let's see 

567.47 571.48 B: what's the other dog that not rottweiler but the other one that people are scared of 

571.74 572.93 A: a pit bull 

571.78 578.49 B: pit bull yeah he looks like a pit bull but he really doesn't have any of the bulldog in him he's just terrier 

578.72 579.97 A: (( yeah yeah huh )) 

579.21 582.55 B: but he really looks like a pit bull so he can look pretty scary too 

583.24 588.95 B: our uh when the guy that comes reads our meters and whatever there he looks like he's going to eat them 

589.83 591.40 B: i'd be scared of him too 

591.30 595.70 A: yeah the german shepherd that my mom has is um he's really 

596.22 599.89 A: he's like he was abused when he was younger so he really scary 

599.04 599.89 B: uh-huh
