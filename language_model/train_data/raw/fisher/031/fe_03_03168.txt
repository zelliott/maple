142.28 151.85 A: when i went to dallas to visit my girlfriend and she had a labrador and she reckoned he was such a good dog i was like okay i didn't think i would really want a big dog but he was a really good dog so

168.65 172.26 B: but they're they're really good and they're um i mean they're just 

172.35 184.31 B: good family dogs they're not they don't bark a lot and they're just not something you have to worry about you know the thing i mean once they get close to you and your family they won't let a stranger come in 

175.17 176.36 A: mhm 

179.01 179.86 A: mhm 

184.36 185.24 A: hm

191.43 192.55 B: so um 

193.27 196.87 A: (( i don't have any kids so it'd just be me and my dog [laughter] )) 

197.27 204.28 B: well um i can imagine um how close you would have felt to him 'cause i have a coworker who just has a dog 

204.46 206.27 B: and it's her baby 

205.87 207.10 A: uh-huh

209.85 218.37 B: and everything she does she has to take princess into consideration so it's like oh we can't go there princess can't go [laughter] 

217.52 223.31 A: now see i wasn't like that i was i never i never got that bad about it but 

223.88 225.14 A: he was um 

225.67 228.09 A: (( he was he was kind of special [laughter] )) 

228.02 232.69 B: yeah my daughter wants a little dog like that she wants to be able to put him in her purse 

233.25 239.82 A: oh [laughter] well you know what i've learnt about what i learned about poodles is that um 

233.32 235.54 B: (( [laughter] )) 

240.33 242.29 A: toy poodles um 

242.73 246.10 A: in order for them to be as as small as as 

246.84 255.90 A: they should well not should get but as small as you've seen them what they do is they breed them down and a toy poodle actually is not as small as the ones that fit in your purse 

251.94 253.13 B: mhm 

255.83 269.78 A: the ones that fit in your purse have been um i forget what they call them but they're not th- they're actually not a breed of dog they've just taken the runt of the toy poodle and breeded them down with more runts and that's how they get 'em to be that small 

269.12 270.90 B: oh okay 

269.93 271.72 A: mhm 

271.47 273.82 B: i did not know that [laughter] 

273.94 278.68 A: i learnt that from the poodle book [laughter] 

276.79 280.65 B: [laughter] well i 

279.67 284.76 A: because as i didn't have any dogs i had to really read up on them because i did not know anything about dogs 

284.85 296.70 B: i think we'll probably start looking for one you know in the next few months we just moved into this house and we're just really not accustomed yet everybody else in the neighborhood has pets 

290.45 291.61 A: mhm 

296.10 297.26 A: mhm 

297.30 301.04 B: and ah my son keeps begging me can i get a dog 

301.24 304.42 B: so i think we'll probably look for one soon 

304.91 305.71 B: so 

305.05 306.54 A: (( yeah they're um they're )) 

307.90 309.60 A: (( they're good to have i um i definitely want a )) 

309.82 312.20 A: i'm definitely interested in the 

313.32 315.45 A: (( chocolate lab i think that's the one that i want )) 

315.80 319.10 B: i think it's good if you're single if you live alone 

319.09 320.37 A: mhm 

319.36 327.61 B: and um they're really good just i mean just in case somebody breaks in or something even if they're not big they can still bark and warn you 

328.11 329.17 B: so 

329.45 337.82 A: yeah yeah well i've been in the house now for four years and my that dog was the only dog i had he was here with me for the first two years i was here 

337.88 338.99 B: mhm

350.45 353.18 B: [laughter] 

353.48 357.91 B: [laughter] that would be something [laughter] 

356.15 358.07 A: [laughter] that would be something 

359.20 363.29 A: i started dating somebody and my dog didn't like him and that's why he ran away 

363.43 367.85 A: he did not i should have listened to the damned dog because he was absolutely right 

368.09 370.38 A: [laughter] my dog hated him 

369.05 370.33 B: well you know 

370.38 377.01 B: you know dogs animals have ah that intuition they can tell when something's just not right

394.32 404.79 A: well then one night i came home and he'd gone down the street and i had to go and find him and i was like why is he doing this because he never did stuff like that and then finally one day he was just like missing 

405.28 414.75 A: him and he left and i was thinking oh yeah he's going to get enough of that leaving and not coming back so my dog did not come back [laughter] i guess he was like i told you 

414.60 419.53 B: [laughter] sometimes people just see them and take them in and then 

419.03 433.17 A: yeah i'm sure that somebody took him because he was a beautiful dog he was absolutely beautiful but he didn't like my my my boyfriend he would do stuff like go and take his his his clothes out of he'd go into the laundry room and take his clothes out of the hamper
