124.16 134.78 B: yeah that's pretty much um how i feel that's how my mother always had had lots of animals around and before i got married when i i was working ten twelve hour days about the only 

129.94 130.94 A: mhm 

134.82 138.49 B: um socialization i'd have would be with the cats at my home

174.68 176.95 A: but um when the baby came 

177.29 182.41 A: we had to put her in we moved her from the family room to the living room 

182.37 183.43 B: mhm 

182.80 189.90 A: and the living room we hardly ever go in there and it just it wasn't fair to her at all and she started um 

185.47 186.50 B: oh 

190.73 195.09 A: they they start to shriek if they're not paid attention to enough you know and 

193.54 196.68 B: oh yes and plucking feathers and 

196.49 202.70 A: yeah she didn't pluck feathers but i you know she was getting a little neurotic and i felt horrible because 

202.99 209.40 A: you know with a an infant it's just impossible to give her the time that she had gotten before and 

209.53 210.96 A: we ended up um 

211.66 215.23 A: [lipsmack] giving her to another family just because it wasn't fair mhm 

215.33 222.59 B: yeah i had to do that with um with my greater cockatoo when i got her i was working part time so i was home a lot of the time 

222.87 232.80 B: and she was a cockatoos take a lot of attention they're the lap birds it seems like and so when i started working full time she started plucking her feathers and everything 

226.60 227.50 A: right 

228.28 229.44 A: mhm 

233.02 240.66 B: so a very good friend of mine that she considered to be one of her people i ge- went ahead and gave her to her simply so that she sweetie was happy [laughter] 

233.17 233.74 A: (( oh )) 

240.48 249.42 A: yeah yeah it's it's not fair when you know and birds they have such a long lifespan too i mean you you don't think they do but they do 

249.55 254.86 B: oh yeah seventy five eighty years is is is easy for the um for the greater birds 

249.67 250.73 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

252.87 253.82 A: yeah 

254.75 258.29 A: i've got i had a cockatiel before i went to college 

258.45 267.81 A: um i had two of them and when i went to college i couldn't take them with me and my mother took care of them and one died and she felt horrible that horrible that one was alone and 

266.04 266.86 B: [mn] 

268.54 272.13 A: so my sister's friend her mom took

287.51 298.13 A: um we still are in touch with with them and turkey's still around and kicking and he ah he's probably almost nineteen years old so i mean 

289.85 290.63 B: [noise] 

298.16 303.83 A: it's a real commitment and you know when circumstances change it's 

300.79 301.96 B: it is ah 

303.92 305.50 A: it's not fair to them 

305.55 312.67 B: yeah i wouldn't mind getting like an amazon or a [mn] macaw except for the fact that they'll live longer than i will now

498.46 499.31 A: him 

499.34 503.83 A: i mean her the bird i brought my son with me and we went during the day 

503.80 516.72 A: and it she lives in this gorgeous gorgeous house by the seashore and it's kind of like a frank lloyd wright type of house and it held it had these different levels and it was all windows and it was she had this front room that had 

510.44 511.46 B: mhm 

516.91 520.42 A: all of these birds like maybe thirty birds in this one room 

520.47 521.78 B: oh goodness [mn] 

521.24 530.54 A: and i had my son and we went she wanted to show me all her birds you know and we went to go into the front room and they all started screaming and it was like 

531.06 540.96 A: you know when your ears ring because something's so loud they were just so incredibly loud and my son just freaked out and 

532.75 533.77 B: (( oh uh-huh ))

562.48 565.33 B: yeah they're not screaming at him there's a big difference 

563.85 572.09 A: ha exactly [laughter] i had covered his ears you know i had put one ear against my chest and one hand over the other ear 

572.13 577.37 A: just because i knew that they might be too loud but they really got loud when we walked in there 

577.44 581.86 A: tha- that woman spends like all day from sun up to sun down with them you know 

582.05 583.62 A: taking care of the birds yeah 

583.53 588.34 B: mhm yeah i couldn't imagine trying to take care of forty dogs 

588.37 594.92 B: and i know birds are even more time consuming because you have to clean cages and everything at least the dogs are not in a cage
