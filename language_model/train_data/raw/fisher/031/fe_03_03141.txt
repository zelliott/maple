196.79 198.02 A: yeah 

197.39 200.53 B: yeah so it it's okay yeah i can deal with it but

226.69 227.87 A: oh 

228.18 229.31 A: really 

228.66 230.78 B: yeah because she doesn't want to get attached to it 

230.86 244.59 A: yeah it is hard you know when we got rid of my other dog my mom i i like cried my eyes out and my mom's like well look at the bright side at least he didn't die he's like you know where he is he's in a safe home he's getting lot's of attention we 

239.96 241.06 B: right 

242.13 243.36 B: right 

244.46 247.86 A: sold him to like this old lady and oh she 

246.42 252.86 B: that's the best place for a dog like that my my lhasa would have been better off in a household like that too especially 

248.00 249.05 A: (( loves him )) 

251.65 252.61 A: yeah 

252.63 262.96 B: just because he was so he was real snippy and he didn't like anybody coming in the house no no uh-huh no when company would come over we'd have to crate him because he would just snip snip snip at 'em 

256.88 258.04 A: really 

262.18 267.06 A: now see we would have to crate chase too because he he just would bark i mean 

266.24 272.43 B: yeah well that too yeah just aggressive behavior they're i don't know if maltese are as aggressive as lhasa apso's or not 

271.80 277.79 A: he didn't nip a lot but he just would growl and bark he was really protective 

275.52 281.33 B: right and just let 'em know well he wouldn't nip at somebody there was only a few people he would nip at and it was always men 

281.21 282.26 A: (( really [laughter] )) 

281.57 295.02 B: females not no and they were just guys just ah he just didn't like males he especially liked females i guess it's because he's with us all the time well like my husband's in the military and he's in uniform and anybody in uniform he would get upset with for some reason he loved my husband but 

282.85 284.05 A: (( oh my gosh ))

301.16 306.91 B: and leave [laughter] go this way you know and say oh let me go and put the dog out and we'd put the dog 

302.02 303.62 A: [laughter]

364.66 365.74 A: really 

367.58 374.62 A: i'm trying to convince my husband we can get a cat it can be an outdoors cat [laughter] then you don't have to be around it 

371.94 380.56 B: oh well yeah no i don't like 'em outside unless you live certain places especially it's like here where we live in florida it's very flea ridden 

380.53 384.40 A: that's i'm in florida too i'm the same way you know 

383.90 391.42 B: the fleas are so bad here i mean gee i don't care what you're having to medicate them so much with other st- all the time that they stay with fleas on them all the time 

389.70 390.85 A: yeah

404.90 405.88 A: yeah 

406.64 412.89 B: but anyway that's that's better than i don't know it's better not having them if you if you're allergic to you don't need to have to deal with that 

412.28 413.42 A: yeah 

413.52 416.06 B: my family have just walked in i'm going to change rooms 

416.27 417.88 B: [laughter] 

416.72 420.10 A: [laughter] i know i'm like in my closet [laughter] 

418.89 429.03 B: yeah well as soon as they come in they want to know who i'm talking to on the phone try and explain that when you're sitting there [laughter] i told them last night i was doing a survey on the phone but anyway [laughter] i'll just 

424.51 426.14 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

427.92 429.37 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

429.44 431.42 B: sit here with my cats 

431.05 432.66 A: [laughter] 

431.92 434.17 B: but anyway so where did you get your dog 

434.37 442.59 A: um well the one that i have now i got him from my sister she um actually breeds them yeah 

441.44 443.09 B: oh she breeds chihuahuas 

442.77 449.25 A: and so it worked out for me because they're kind of expensive and she just gave him to me 

443.33 444.56 B: wow 

447.38 448.51 B: (( yeah )) 

448.55 458.26 B: i i can imagine if she is a good breeder i know how expensive they are my dog was extremely expensive my husband had a heart attack when he saw how much i paid for it oh my gosh yeah well because they're 

455.19 456.33 A: really 

458.33 465.25 B: if they're well bred and they come from a reputable breeder who sells them only to people that are willing to pay that price [laughter] 

464.08 466.76 A: yeah that's how my other dog was 

465.86 471.94 B: she's got you know ones that are all basically all the dogs that comes the line that she comes from are show dogs so 

471.61 472.82 A: oh really 

472.12 482.26 B: yeah it's just actually her one of her siblings was in the new york times a couple of weeks ago yeah yeah she she comes from a pretty famous line of doggies but 

476.77 478.97 A: cool that's cool 

481.46 484.55 A: [laughter] she's a show dog 

482.55 489.80 B: (( still a rat [laughter] she's still a dog everybody says she looks like a mutt to me [laughter] but she's a well bred mutt )) 

489.99 496.94 A: i know now i was saying to my husband i'm like maybe it's because he's like full blooded and all this why he's so crazy and the other one 

496.15 507.98 B: i th- you know what though i really do think that's true actually i think they get a lot quirkier because the more bred together with other animals they're either more mellowed out and the less health problems they have 

505.55 506.78 A: yeah 

508.00 510.29 B: and they don't have all the genetic 

510.99 512.64 B: stuff that they get from breeding 

512.98 513.95 A: uh-huh 

514.47 518.47 B: i think we got cut off didn't we no i think that no i think yeah i think 

514.50 515.41 A: hello 

518.53 520.48 B: whatever their little robotic thing 

519.86 522.62 A: i guess it comes on and tells us it's been ten minutes 

522.04 527.12 B: yeah i don't know i haven't watched the clock so i have no idea if women are on the phone they can talk 

524.72 526.36 A: me either this is my 

527.05 528.54 A: first time doing this 

528.20 531.65 B: me too me too they called last night but i wasn't here 

531.27 537.58 A: they called me last night too but it was sports and i'm like no not doing that and then when i heard pets and i'm like oh cool okay 

534.57 535.67 B: [laughter] 

536.92 538.64 B: (( it was sports )) 

538.13 540.71 A: yeah it was sports and i'm like i know 

539.72 553.56 B: i wouldn't know what to talk about [laughter] [laughter] that's what you did so that if you don't like it you can talk about something else but anyway pets is more interesting you're right i agree with that and have you had any other pets besides dogs and geckos 

540.83 543.12 A: [laughter] 

545.19 546.27 A: (( so i just hung up ))

573.70 577.67 B: it will [laughter] like a frog does oh gross 

575.66 576.61 A: (( i'm like )) 

576.81 584.35 A: i freak out you know now it's like i'm scared to hold him i'm so scarred he's going to pee on me again [laughter] my husband's like you've got a pet
