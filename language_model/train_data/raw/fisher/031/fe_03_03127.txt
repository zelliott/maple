175.49 188.40 A: well no no it wasn't that i i mean the er er they they'd chase each other round the house and and so on and so forth you know and then like um the girl that was living with us she moved out on her own and she took her cat with her you know 

181.56 182.62 B: oh 

188.15 189.10 B: oh

210.57 212.61 B: i know that's not possible 

212.05 221.11 A: no that's that's no each it's like people right relationships are all different right with animals it's the same way so um [laughter]

228.80 242.92 A: we had one and my mother got rid of it there were seven kids eh we were the oldest and we lived in the city and what was happening the dog would be in the yard the other kids would come along and tease the dog to the point it started getting mean 

231.92 233.33 B: oh 

243.15 248.04 A: so up until i went out out on my own and then i've always had dogs 

248.08 249.03 B: yeah

249.46 251.93 A: so [laughter] 

251.44 262.90 B: yeah i mean i just you know i would if i got a dog it would have to be like a huge dog that i don't know because it seems like the bigger the dogs get the more gentle they get because you know little poodles 

262.90 272.29 A: (( yeah they bark all day and chihuahuas [laughter] )) 

263.32 265.87 B: (( they're little cruel little things ))

278.95 280.51 B: yeah 

279.60 281.76 A: like eighty five pounds 

281.03 282.91 B: i always wanted a great dane 

282.98 289.93 B: i'm five foot two and i think he'd be about as big as me i always thought it'd be kind of neat to have like marmaduke lying on the couch 

289.56 292.98 A: [laughter] take up the whole couch 

291.98 298.58 B: [laughter] yeah take up the whole couch because i think it would be tough to feed a lot of food there 

298.02 306.92 A: yeah yeah you you you gotta have a [laughter] fifty thousand dollar a year job just for your medicals and [laughter] 

303.56 304.81 B: yeah

316.22 317.15 B: yeah 

320.22 323.88 B: yeah they are they're getting some really bad qualities in 

323.33 333.89 A: yeah and um like i i i met the mom you know and all the other pups that were there and you know so i mean and they're friends of ours too you know

329.58 330.73 B: oh 

333.53 334.39 B: uh-huh 

333.91 340.86 A: so um i've always had mixed breeds like like barney was a a mixed lab you know 

340.10 341.07 B: mhm 

340.87 344.97 A: and the one before that she was a smaller dog she was a

374.93 375.81 B: (( oh )) 

381.40 382.50 B: oh
