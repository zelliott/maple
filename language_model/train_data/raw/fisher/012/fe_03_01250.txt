81.01 86.55 A: (( amount of your life um i i am fifty two and i think affirmative action came )) 

86.61 88.09 A: (( into play )) 

88.13 94.50 A: ((  )) 

94.82 97.82 A: (( five and thirty years and at the )) 

97.86 103.04 A: (( time i thought it was ah a reasonably good idea because there definitely was a lot of )) 

103.44 107.67 A: (( um real blatant discrimination in the in the )) 

109.88 110.95 A: (( work force )) 

111.23 112.24 A: (( particularly )) 

113.45 116.44 A: (( against ah certain groups whether that was ah ))

122.15 123.92 A: (( the kind of )) 

125.55 134.63 A: (( opportunities that were available for people ah and promotions and )) 

135.41 136.41 A: (( ah the ah )) 

137.27 139.10 A: (( also the pay scales )) 

141.10 141.85 A: (( were )) 

142.40 143.31 A: um 

144.18 145.06 A: (( very )) 

145.71 147.02 A: (( unbalanced )) 

147.88 148.76 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

148.60 157.19 A: ah in california our state ah voted on legislature to eliminate affirmative action 

157.23 159.20 A: (( in ah )) 

159.43 163.23 A: state organizations so um 

163.35 171.11 A: employers can still pursue affirmative action but it's not necessary for ah state contracting 

171.11 172.25 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

171.15 179.79 A: and so that was a really a big change and i think what had occurred over time is there was a lot of abuse 

179.71 186.63 A: of that ah the pendulum kind of swung the other way and in- instead of it affirmative action really working 

186.66 188.43 A: to help 

188.39 193.28 A: ah people get ahead it ended up causing more resentment 

193.24 207.61 A: and people who ah actually were not equally qualified but less qualified were getting a push ahead which was really i don't think the original intent the original intent i think was 

193.27 194.19 B: right 

207.57 221.10 A: ah if they were [laughter] roughly y- you know pretty similar in qualifications that stronger consideration would be given to a candidate that in the past would have just been overlooked because of their gender or their race 

221.10 222.27 B: mhm 

221.21 228.79 A: ah but it became very unbalanced i think in some instances so anyway that's what i think [laughter] 

228.01 228.84 B: well 

228.89 230.76 B: um i think that 

230.88 234.64 B: as far as like people getting into colleges and things 

233.97 234.92 A: uh-huh 

234.89 238.81 B: and the hiring and all that i don't think that they should um 

239.06 250.88 B: pick out you know well we have to have ten black people and ten spanish people and ten white people i don't think it should be you know that and i just i for 

244.88 245.73 A: yeah 

250.95 254.55 B: also people with you know all the money can go to school 

254.39 255.31 A: right 

254.66 257.31 B: an- and i and i think that there's 

258.19 259.72 B: i mean i'm i'm 

259.81 266.51 B: half french and half chilean so i can i can say [laughter] that i do feel like a lot of the 

261.78 262.65 A: uh-huh 

263.58 264.48 A: uh-huh 

266.91 271.90 B: you know the the anglos are getting pushed aside because 

269.63 270.46 A: uh-huh 

271.91 278.77 B: you know this kid was native american and or a hispanic an- and i don't think it's fair you know 

274.97 275.84 A: yeah 

276.47 277.55 A: uh-huh 

278.41 289.96 A: no no it it it isn't and ah i think that's i i i look and i think well this was a a social experiment tried in our country to 

289.93 292.76 A: kind of even the scales 

292.72 300.33 A: and it it got to the point and and even where it's still enforced where instead of 

300.15 311.44 A: evening things up maybe it did in part do that but i think overall it caused more resentment and tremendously unfair systems 

307.83 308.77 B: yeah 

311.18 312.07 B: mhm 

311.42 318.30 A: and it backfired ah i think it's a- an avenue to reduce discrimination 

318.36 329.91 A: ah people thought as not a fair thing but a very unfair thing and there was a lot resentment and a lot of assumptions about particularly 

329.84 343.40 A: minorities but even women i worked in the corporate world for many many years and there were some assumptions made that we- you know you got ahead because you are the affirmative action 

334.45 335.34 B: uh-huh 

337.41 338.53 B: (( uh-huh )) 

340.73 341.81 B: yeah 

343.37 344.86 A: you know black 

344.14 346.01 B: poster poster child [laughter] 

344.97 348.95 A: female yeah yeah and but for that [laughter] 

348.88 361.24 A: you know you wouldn't be ahead and and you got where you were be- not because you deserved it not because you earned it and even though people wouldn't directly say it you know they were thinking it you know they were thinking it [laughter] 

354.04 354.95 B: right 

360.18 361.56 B: and they still do 

361.35 364.51 A: oh oh absolutely i think that's very true 

362.87 364.30 B: i mean that's the thing 

364.80 370.71 B: it's still it's i still i mean i even feel it sometimes [laughter] like i can't say i don't you know 

364.86 366.19 A: very true [mn] 

370.48 372.45 A: uh-huh as a woman you do 

372.77 373.85 B: um 

373.86 376.35 B: or or just when i see 

376.47 377.62 B: certain things 

376.65 390.74 A: oh you still wonder about it if you see it like how did how did they get where they were yeah i and i think still instead of there being this perception well they they had the proper background or experience 

378.55 380.57 B: yeah oh yeah 

381.65 382.75 B: oh i mean 

390.52 393.58 B: well what's that what's her what's clinton's daughter's name

410.48 419.20 A: what in the world does she did she come out of college and have that kind of ah leverage to do it i think is it consulting work she's doing i don't know

427.73 428.85 B: (( but yeah )) 

430.02 431.49 B: exactly 

430.68 444.26 A: [laughter] but ah ah it it's really interesting i did a lot of work when i um wa- was employed at my last job for eighteen years and we 

431.65 432.41 B: but 

443.46 444.39 B: (( wow )) 

444.27 447.90 A: yeah [laughter] i got laid off just got laid off last year [mn] 

447.42 448.80 B: oh my god 

448.42 454.27 A: um i know it was not good although i was pretty burned out [mn] ah but ah 

454.34 460.21 A: it yeah it was pretty catastrophic i mean when you don't know that you're going to have that happen 

460.58 468.24 A: ah but ah one of the things that i was responsible for doing was um government contracting 

468.49 471.24 A: and i definitely saw in working 

468.63 469.47 B: uh-huh 

471.18 474.16 A: on the government contracts the 

474.01 487.06 A: abuses that would go on with affirmative action where cities would have so many stipulations or well california eliminated it but federal contracts 

479.99 480.85 B: yeah 

486.99 491.76 A: that the public sector ended up paying 

491.76 497.05 A: far more and going with really in some instances very 

496.93 507.92 A: ah shaky flaky companies just because they were minorities just because and they were the ones building the roads [mn] um 

497.93 498.75 B: (( yeah )) 

499.96 500.94 B: ooh 

502.20 503.44 B: oh no 

503.72 504.62 B: yeah 

506.86 507.77 B: (( right mhm )) 

507.86 521.98 A: or ah doing certain kinds of business or infrastructure contracts and the only claim to fame they had was that it was a in quotes um minority or 

521.91 529.25 A: ah some some favored group and not because they should get the contract because of competence 

522.18 523.04 B: yeah 

529.33 539.08 A: and ah so it was kind of like a combination of was it affirm- you know an affirmative action company combined with you know rock bottom pricing 

539.07 546.94 A: and you know you think of the taxpayer you know businesses don't operate that way the government it's stupid for the government to do that 

546.63 552.11 B: i know they do that here in santa fe a lot they do a lot of the the locals and the 

548.75 550.13 A: do they really 

552.31 555.24 B: you know the h- traditional hispanic locals here 

555.05 556.15 A: uh-huh 

555.46 560.88 B: they it's like you just you just that's how they do things [laughter] 

560.16 562.44 A: yeah yeah and and then 

561.41 563.75 B: you get in trouble if you don't [laughter] 

563.35 575.51 A: well and then the other thing that is disgusting that i used to run into is that [mn] is if the whole point is to give these um typically minority groups 

575.59 585.10 A: chan- or an opportunity when you scratch below the surface and you find often it's a figure head that is put in there 

585.04 592.61 A: or a a kind of a shell company and behind it is another organisation that has set it up 

590.18 591.52 B: oh 

592.58 593.55 B: yeah 

592.74 596.82 A: and so it's just this kind of a weird ah 

596.85 597.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

597.68 599.89 A: yeah game that is not re-
