62.97 63.69 A: and 

67.00 75.17 A: i i i i don't know because i figured the topic would take up the ten minutes but sources of information doesn't 

67.73 68.13 B: they didn't 

71.58 72.66 B: entire time 

75.96 77.54 A: doesn't take up too much time 

77.43 78.62 B: i know that's what i mean 

79.88 83.14 B: but it is a shame about them did you hear about that general though that got 

83.32 84.20 B: caught with uh 

84.70 86.02 B: thirty guys or something 

86.53 87.33 A: oh that 

86.63 87.41 B: on our side 

87.77 88.90 A: that one i think i missed 

89.07 92.16 B: no they had that because i was watching uh i watch uh 

92.89 94.15 B: katherine pryor too 

94.45 95.00 A: uh huh 

94.72 99.19 B: it's uh five o'clock and uh on the bottom of the screen it said a general 

99.72 101.95 B: and uh i think it said thirty uh 

102.74 103.91 B: of our guys they got 

104.90 105.65 A: hm 

105.48 106.68 B: so that makes you sick 

107.60 108.51 A: yeah i 

107.83 111.51 B: especially for a general because i mean you know i always think they're more apt to 

111.66 112.45 B: hurt them more 

112.58 114.25 A: yeah they're more them them 

113.81 114.80 B: because they know more 

115.05 117.43 A: the higher up they are the more torture they'll 

117.80 119.19 B: that's what i kind of figure 

119.73 121.38 B: but then they said too now though that 

121.73 126.34 B: when they show these people and things on t._v. though these p._o._w.'s then that means that they 

126.74 127.89 B: have to account for them 

128.64 131.36 B: so they really shouldn't be able to like kill and stuff 

132.00 135.32 A: mhm except that by showing them on t._v. they're 

136.01 140.11 A: i think the way i understood it they are um 

140.05 141.06 B: it's the geneva cla- 

141.23 141.83 A: yeah 

141.63 141.91 B: yeah 

142.42 143.04 B: yeah i know 

143.38 145.79 B: they shouldn't be allowed to do that but i mean 

145.96 155.07 B: but they said though in a way you know i heard somebody else talking on on it and he says well in a way though the whole world knows they have those specific people 

155.41 156.03 A: yes 

155.72 157.36 B: so that they'll have to account for them 

157.48 158.70 B: so i said that's you know
