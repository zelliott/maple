125.70 134.09 A: so i think it's an interesting topic i don't know i think it helps to le- level the playing field often but i'm not so sure how i feel about it um

145.55 146.44 A: mhm 

146.05 148.38 B: it's ah it's very difficult

152.55 154.44 B: so and i have no

168.26 169.14 B: so 

168.75 175.59 A: yeah i've read that women make seventy six cents for every dollar that a man makes and that's just that's very troubling 

175.25 179.38 B: it is very troubling because i work just as hard as they do if not harder 

179.32 180.24 A: mhm 

179.79 184.59 B: but i won't kiss anybody's ass to get anywhere in life either [laughter]

195.08 196.00 A: wow 

195.64 200.90 B: yeah because they don't feel that i'm qualified they feel that women belong at home bare foot and pregnant 

201.34 202.12 A: (( mm mhm )) 

202.30 204.72 B: and i've had to ah gain a respect 

205.48 219.24 B: and ah and able to go back and to do their inspections it's very difficult in my field i've gained a lot of respect over the years but i still meet new customers that don't think women belong in the field they would- believe women belong at home 

219.49 222.13 A: sure yeah there's a lot of people out there like that 

221.63 229.87 B: sure and ah unfortunately that's not the society that we live in today you need two incomes i'm not going to sit behind a desk and answer phones it's not me 

230.06 230.95 A: mhm 

230.51 237.02 B: you know i'd rather be a on hands type of individual versus being ah i don't i don't take orders well 

237.20 238.10 A: mhm 

237.38 240.15 B: you know sitting and have somebody look over my shoulder all day long 

242.28 246.39 B: i like to work independently and i do that in my job and i do that very well 

246.76 248.14 B: and i'm confident i've 

248.72 249.63 A: mhm 

250.41 252.47 B: been in the business for almost twenty years 

253.15 253.99 A: wow

272.51 273.41 B: okay 

273.51 274.30 A: (( so )) 

274.08 275.02 B: me too 

278.73 281.01 A: so what do you think about the war in iraq 

281.59 287.97 B: i think it's pretty scary i've got two older brothers that are they're forty nine and fifty years old 

288.09 291.85 B: one on the u._s._s. and one on the ground in the national guards 

291.70 294.24 A: oh wow are they serving over there right now 

293.68 298.70 B: yes they are yup my brother's in the ah persian gulf and the other one is over in ah kuwait 

299.41 308.24 B: so yeah it's it's really scary but ah long term i think ah that we will be a lot better off with ah saddam hussein out of office 

299.57 300.35 A: (( awesome )) 

308.12 309.34 A: (( i agree mhm mm )) 

309.16 313.27 B: it's unfortunate that we have to ah go to these lengths to make it happen 

313.29 314.28 B: but 

314.84 322.42 B: i i'm a person that does not believe an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth but if you have to stop somebody and this is the only way you can do it 

322.71 335.34 B: then we need to do that and i hope that nobody gets killed and that people don't lose their brothers or sisters or parents of what have you it's not ah it's a very dif- very touchy to- very touchy subject for everybody 

334.95 336.76 A: yeah that's for sure 

336.23 338.91 B: there's a lot of ah protesting going on 

338.69 339.45 A: mhm 

338.96 343.97 B: they don't want our people over there well i'll tell you what if you don't want any people over there and we get bombed what are we going to do 

344.31 345.17 A: yeah 

344.73 347.02 B: when you let your guard down what's going to happen 

348.07 355.39 A: i know i totally agree it has to be done i think the regime has to be changed and i've been watching the news and everything and it's it's just so crazy 

356.05 367.97 A: especially for somebody of my generation i i'm nineteen years old and you know my generation has never you know had anything like this you know we didn't experience vietnam and we were too young for you know the first gulf war and 

367.19 368.48 B: mhm 

368.06 372.08 A: it's just it's really scary to talk about it in classes and everything and 

372.31 382.76 A: and especially the deep divide that it seems like it's causing in the generation i mean there's so many students protesting and then there's you know some like me who support you know our government it's hard because 

383.40 388.77 B: well you you put you put a man in office who has to take care of our country 

388.61 389.81 A: mhm 

388.92 393.08 B: we may not always agree with his decisions his or her decisions but 

393.15 398.41 B: he's the one that's protecting us he really is i'm going to be thirty eight years old here 

396.35 397.14 A: yeah 

398.53 401.60 B: you know i've got a son who's just two years younger than you are 

401.83 404.00 B: and he's talking about joining the service 

405.14 416.28 B: you know as a as a parent with one child i i can't imagine my son going into the service but on the other hand if that's what my son wants to do to protect his his country 

416.29 423.07 B: i commend him for that and if it's going to bring bring people down like that and take them out of control 

417.88 418.73 A: (( mhm )) 

423.47 424.42 A: mhm 

423.74 428.05 B: and keep us safe by all means i gladly 

428.08 432.04 B: give my son my support in doing so it's just a shame that 

432.15 442.13 B: our country and the people that are living in this country can't be that supportive when our gentlemen and women came back from vietnam do you know how badly they were 

443.07 445.40 A: i i've heard i've heard that they were 

443.28 444.03 B: (( i know )) 

445.03 454.13 B: it was it was awful i mean i was very young myself but my older brothers served in that war to this day they still don't talk about it because it was so traumatic 

454.79 459.15 B: and what did the people in this country do did they welcome them home no they didn't 

460.09 464.30 B: they didn't do that today now we give them everything that they need 

464.28 465.19 A: mhm 

464.36 468.16 B: but back then we didn't do we want to make the same mistake today 

468.45 473.80 B: no i don't think that we sh- that we should make the same mistake put our trust in our government 

474.31 484.21 B: let them do what they need to to protect us otherwise the world trade center not only once is it going to happen but it's going to happen again and again and again and again until somebody stops it 

484.47 485.33 A: (( yup )) 

485.83 489.13 A: and every single day when watch the news it just seems like 

489.36 502.21 A: like more and more this is the right thing to do and not only for our country but for the iraqis as well i mean i've seen them come out and and dance in the streets and tear down posters of saddam and it just seems like it's really 

502.18 504.37 A: it's really the right thing to do and i wish that 

504.63 509.29 A: all the peace protesters would realise that and start respecting our troops and our government 

509.13 513.99 B: right and they don't and and it's very unfortunate because it turns into a lot of hatred 

514.15 519.68 B: in this country and that's the last thing that this country needs right now is to turn against each other 

519.77 520.62 A: yeah 

520.16 522.74 B: we should all be working together 

522.95 524.78 B: and sticking together 

524.92 526.93 B: like we have all these years 

528.34 533.22 B: it's terrible it's really sad i wouldn't want to be a young woman like yourself today 

533.47 537.44 B: making plans for marriage and having a family i i wouldn't have any more children 

537.55 541.77 B: i wouldn't want them to live in this kind of society with that kind of hatred 

542.23 546.53 B: there's no way forget it it's bad enough my son has to live it now 

546.64 547.62 A: mhm 

547.95 551.83 A: yeah it's definitely a changing society i mean our this 

551.94 556.48 A: the events that have been unfolding in the past you know two or three days i mean they're going to define 

556.29 568.23 A: my generation i mean you know what what happens with foreign policy and what the arab world thinks of us and it's just very scary i feel like i don't really have that much control over it right now but i know in the future that's going to be 

568.76 572.93 A: what what we're going to have to deal with anti american sentiment everywhere 

573.83 579.26 B: yes it is going to be your responsibility and your generation's responsibility
