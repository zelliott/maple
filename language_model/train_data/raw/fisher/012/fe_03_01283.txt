175.90 181.34 A: that's oh my goodness it helps so much to talk to someone cause there are so many things you can't cover it all on your own 

181.25 181.87 B: no 

181.90 187.49 A: i know with the new york times it feels like it's a novel becau- you just can't get through it all in a day

187.81 188.21 B: and uh

196.30 197.09 A: no 

197.84 198.54 A: that 

198.90 200.46 A: no it makes it difficult 

200.42 201.43 B: uh-huh 

201.33 201.93 A: but 

202.08 205.77 A: uh i'd like to try i think it's important especially right now 

204.62 207.91 B: oh yeah you have to know what's going on i'm telling 

207.41 208.36 A: yeah 

208.45 214.01 B: one nice one thing that's worth what we don't have cable here either we choose not 

208.66 208.92 A: um 

213.16 213.93 A: oh okay 

214.13 216.96 B: we choose not to have it cause it's very expensive 

217.18 218.97 A: oh this is yeah that's true 

217.61 218.03 B: and 

218.82 219.60 B: and uh 

219.76 225.86 B: (( )) but they have a big television in the waiting room and they usually have c._n._n. on 

226.01 226.84 A: oh 

226.25 230.92 B: so uh you get a lot of you know the news that way too while i'm sitting there 

231.23 232.01 A: yeah that 

231.80 236.16 B: and uh we have a lot of discussions the people that are waiting either to get 

236.72 239.24 B: their treatment or the spouse is waiting 

239.62 246.89 B: you know we all interact that way oh what did he say and then what each one thinks about it you know 

239.65 241.33 A: oh yeah 

245.21 249.22 A: do you usually run in to fairly opinionated people or 

249.30 251.76 B: uh pretty much so uh 

251.39 251.95 A: yeah 

252.30 254.23 B: they're not afraid to say you know 

254.47 257.23 B: if one person saying one thing they're not afraid 

257.62 262.56 B: to come out and say they oppose it and feel this way about something 

261.83 263.25 A: right right 

263.34 263.68 B: so that 

263.81 265.19 B: good and nobody gets 

264.49 265.08 A: yeah 

265.35 267.66 B: upset about anything that way 

266.99 267.74 A: no 

268.46 270.95 A: well it's it's nice when you do it that way because 

271.50 272.19 A: i found like 

272.83 277.18 A: great to have discussions like that where you're talking about your opinions when you're with people who are 

277.29 287.27 A: keeping up to date with what's going on but it can be very frustrating when you're talking to people who seems a lot of the people have opinions but don't really keep up with what's going on and so 

285.31 285.96 B: no 

287.21 289.27 B: well it's surprising how many people 

289.54 290.53 B: you've used the 

291.03 295.28 B: you know you think are educated and all would know what's going on all the time 

295.58 296.16 A: mhm 

295.87 299.26 B: and and then you get talking and and you'll say you know 

299.38 302.02 B: something that you've seen or read in the news 

302.49 306.34 B: and they don't know anyth- well when did that happen 

304.86 308.04 A: yeah it's kind of scary isn't it i mean 

306.79 309.28 B: you know and i hear oh my gosh 

309.48 310.57 A: yeah 

309.76 312.31 B: we have a coffee group that uh 

312.51 313.04 B: oh 

313.25 315.97 B: once a week on friday mornings you know and 

316.32 317.44 B: we'll be talking and 

317.84 320.31 B: this one girl in particular 

320.67 323.45 B: i i'm amazed at what she doesn't know 

323.14 325.21 A: oh really yeah 

323.85 325.95 B: (( )) you know what's going on and 

326.33 329.29 B: (( )) well where did you hear that you know and i say 

326.45 327.16 A: oh 

328.54 329.38 A: yeah 

329.83 338.43 B: gosh i said you didn't look at the paper or uh you must look at t._v. with the break in news or something even if you don't stay glued to it you know 

330.83 331.65 A: the thing 

335.24 336.84 A: yeah that you'd think so 

338.82 340.01 A: right right 

340.59 342.65 A: oh yeah that's definitely 

343.64 345.04 A: good to keep up i guess 

346.15 346.72 B: yeah 

346.35 350.86 A: i don't know i always wonder it's interesting cause a lot of what i've been reading lately 

351.16 356.63 A: talks about reports here and then reports in other places saying different things like other countries 

355.65 357.36 B: (( )) uh-huh 

357.96 359.94 A: and i don't know that always makes me a little 

360.28 360.83 B: we were just 

360.64 361.30 A: i don't know 

361.33 365.04 B: sitting here watching it hap- it's the war news and uh 

365.67 372.14 B: they had a retired general and he's telling you everything that's going to happen and he had a map there you know and 

372.25 372.80 A: mhm 

372.56 373.03 B: i said 

373.19 384.13 B: you know how does he know all this going on i said (( )) you know the the generals that are there aren't speaking about anything but he's telling it all 

375.94 377.44 A: i know 

380.63 383.51 A: i know i know 

383.63 389.48 A: i know it is it's kind of i don't know it's strange sometimes how that works 

384.22 384.79 B: well 

389.16 389.75 B: mhm 

389.59 393.27 A: and it seems like many people feel that they're qualified to 

393.55 394.19 A: speak on it 

394.53 396.13 A: so you never know who you should actually 

395.98 396.41 B: (( )) 

396.53 401.86 B: (( )) some of this these news reports though i mean they have all these retired 

401.99 407.53 B: um usually generals or admirals or something and they're doing all the speaking you know and then 

405.05 405.63 A: right 

408.15 412.60 B: five minutes after they get finished they come in with another news report 

412.78 416.55 B: and from directly from the battlefield and it's a 

417.14 419.02 B: a completely different story 

419.14 422.35 A: i know i know that that definitely makes you wonder 

423.13 426.51 A: and it's yeah that's i always wonder i was actually reading something 

426.98 428.09 A: today um 

428.51 429.92 A: it was a few statements from 

430.28 432.25 A: tommy franks of the armed forces 

432.32 433.07 B: mhm 

433.17 433.61 A: and 

433.95 438.29 A: i was actually kind of curious to how so many of these high officials and 

438.76 440.07 A: the government and the 

440.80 443.25 A: armed forces have so much time to talk to the press 

444.00 446.29 A: you know i always kind of wonder about how they have time to 

445.76 447.13 B: yeah i is 

446.69 449.58 A: keep up with there up dates when they're actually over there doing 

450.26 452.30 A: well some of them are over there not all of them but 

452.03 454.81 B: now but well he was he spoke uh 

454.97 458.59 B: (( )) he was on t._v. sunday morning i like to watch all the 

459.28 461.44 B: news pro- not news but the 

461.71 462.54 B: oh 

463.23 471.01 B: the oh i can't think of his name yet but on the different channels the they have you know group panels that discuss everything 

470.67 472.17 A: oh yeah yeah 

471.77 472.69 B: and so 

472.87 476.62 B: but he was on oh a good hour i bet and he had about 

477.21 477.96 B: uh 

478.07 479.27 B: i wish there was about eight 

479.69 481.72 B: people in the background you know his 

481.83 482.36 B: staff 

482.82 483.29 A: mhm 

483.13 489.29 B: and he's talking and you know telling answering questions from all these reporters from all over the world 

489.79 495.93 B: some you could tell were really against us some you know were with us and uh 

492.80 493.95 A: oh yeah 

494.55 495.95 A: right 

496.28 500.75 B: but i thought if all these people were standing there you know his staff 

500.90 503.34 B: and he only called on one of them i 

501.22 501.72 A: mhm 

503.62 504.73 B: he called on the one 

504.98 507.19 B: and the and the man he had uh 

507.31 514.16 B: television behind him and he was showing you different things you know this happened and this is what it looked like so uh 

514.50 519.23 B: so on and and you know he gave a nice talk about what was going on and you could understand it 

519.59 521.98 B: and i got the impression well he must (( )) 

522.07 524.44 B: of these persons behind were going to a 

524.62 525.21 B: you know 

525.43 531.13 B: talk about some phase of what was going on but but he started talking again and they just 

528.04 528.73 A: right 

531.24 541.81 B: sit there you know and they'd and they'd smile and they'd sort of move a little you know from standing for so long but they never said anything they marched in and marched out 

532.17 533.04 A: oh 

537.66 539.12 A: yeah oh 

539.26 542.97 A: they just the back up 

542.33 543.66 B: gosh so 

543.66 544.44 A: oh 

543.82 548.70 B: that was i thought well oh they all these people must be you know from different sections and they're going to 

549.13 553.72 B: you know give their side of what's going on where they are but it didn't work out that way 

553.86 558.97 A: i know i know it's interesting they're so many ah it's kind of weird they're so many sides you don't 

559.22 560.58 A: hear about i just actually went 

560.69 562.61 A: to a lecture today with one of my roommates 

562.80 563.39 B: uh-huh 

563.20 564.40 A: on the like um 

564.85 565.92 A: the possibility of 

566.61 567.99 A: putting a democracy 

568.23 569.19 A: in to 

569.32 570.49 A: iraq after 

571.05 573.45 A: saddam's regime is ended assuming it is 

573.85 574.17 A: and 

574.50 578.23 A: um we actually learned a lot about the the two conflicting 

578.49 584.49 A: ideas in just in inner governmental agencies in our country like the pentagon and the um 

585.37 588.74 A: vice president's office have one way they want to do it and then the 

588.87 593.35 A: um state department and c._i._a. have a totally different plan and they can't even agree on 

594.04 595.80 A: which one they would follow
