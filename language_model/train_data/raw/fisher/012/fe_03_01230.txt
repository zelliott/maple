0.38 1.64 B: hello 

1.20 3.68 A: hi this jarred bricky 

3.67 6.21 B: hi jarred my name's becca johnston 

6.60 8.18 A: hi becca how you doing 

8.02 12.75 B: (( okay um you go to public school or are you you sound young )) 

12.89 17.96 A: um i'm let's see twenty two so i actually go i go to university 

15.30 16.61 B: oh yeah 

17.34 20.33 B: yeah you're not going to public school anymore [laughter] 

19.76 20.78 A: uh-huh 

20.62 23.14 B: well i'm a little older than that so 

23.46 29.71 B: and i send my children to private school because i don't believe in the public school system i do believe in the private school system 

29.44 30.68 A: oh really 

30.51 32.25 B: so um 

32.99 36.26 B: but if the question was do 

36.63 41.00 B: um we believe there's something wrong with the public school system 

40.70 41.69 A: uh-huh 

41.36 43.19 B: and so obviously 

43.37 45.38 B: i don't know that somethings wrong 

45.82 47.93 B: but i just think that um 

48.87 50.61 B: there's better out there 

50.61 52.32 A: right 

51.72 53.36 B: so what do you think 

53.39 63.13 A: i think so too i i ah i think there's a lot of lack of motivation like in some of the teachers that especially secondary education 

63.10 64.00 B: right 

63.91 71.59 A: and so when they have a lack of you know motivation to put effort into teaching the kids obviously a lot of things slip 

71.51 80.30 A: and they don't teach as well and the kids don't learn as much and it just becomes something that's required that you know to go on to college first 

79.86 82.18 B: right and they just kind of push you through 

81.96 83.04 A: uh-huh 

82.64 85.36 B: trying to get you through um 

85.98 87.01 B: to 

87.09 89.76 B: say you graduated basically 

88.59 89.51 A: right 

89.60 90.66 A: uh-huh 

90.31 94.77 B: and but then when you go on passed that you have problems 

94.67 95.70 A: uh-huh 

95.10 104.43 B: and there's more of a chance of being drop outs and there are those that go through the public school system and do wonderful you know and and i think that the 

101.07 102.08 A: uh-huh 

104.89 107.92 B: the teachers can kind of single some of them out 

108.24 119.49 B: and ah as in any school that the teachers can single the the the better ones out and and motivate better and their hands are tied with the ones that they're kind of afraid of 

119.57 120.62 B: um 

121.28 122.67 B: i know here in 

122.75 125.78 B: in ah public school here we have um 

126.01 128.03 B: a federal programme to help 

128.48 130.62 B: drop outs ah 

130.98 136.82 B: and put kids that are supposed to be ah that are on the verge of dropping out and have bad grades 

137.12 140.96 B: and pregnant moms or whatever thing you know in the high school 

140.82 141.80 A: uh-huh 

141.13 148.70 B: and it's it's worked a lot to help motivate the kids to have um mentors that are closer their own age 

148.74 149.77 B: um 

149.79 151.28 B: working with them 

151.33 152.38 B: and ah 

152.42 155.81 B: it was a u._s. department of education grant 

155.88 157.06 A: oh was it 

156.48 158.64 B: that um this the 

158.70 160.69 B: programme that the school got here 

160.80 163.20 B: through another pro- through another agency 

163.39 167.80 B: and it it was really working and now with the funding and 

167.83 175.09 B: a lot of kids are kind of going to be put out because of it because you know they're looking for more grants now 

175.16 179.30 B: but um it was a good thing for those kids that were dropping out 

179.33 182.37 B: a- where they kind of get left 

182.95 185.05 B: left to flounder i think 

184.74 185.72 A: uh-huh 

185.18 192.04 B: in the public schools and you can find those in the private schools too but there's more motivation because the parents are paying for it 

191.46 193.54 A: right it it costs a lot more 

193.46 198.33 B: yeah and um you know if the kids are screwing around the parents are going to know about it 

198.07 199.03 A: uh-huh 

198.51 200.66 B: where in the private school 

200.84 206.70 B: they're kind of on their own and it's kind of you know like they're bringing themselves up especially when they get to that age 

206.50 208.61 A: right 

207.65 211.04 B: so i think that um the teachers 

211.58 222.61 B: are in it for the money as much as there may not be that high a the salary it's better than private schools tuition or a private school pay [noise] for teachers 

221.59 224.58 A: is it pretty low pay for private schools 

223.85 228.80 B: yeah it is and um and yet the schools cost a lot of money you know [noise] 

224.80 225.91 A: oh 

229.07 230.65 B: for other programmes 

230.83 231.98 A: i see 

231.11 232.95 B: [noise] so um 

233.55 239.03 B: [noise] you know when they can go on strike you know there are some dedicated people anywhere you go 

238.80 239.78 A: right 

239.68 247.45 B: private school public school um [noise] and there are some dedicated students you get some good and some fantastic kids through public school 

247.60 248.53 B: um 

248.74 253.91 B: it's just that i see so many slipping through the cracks and like you said no motivation 

253.79 254.80 A: uh-huh 

254.42 256.31 B: um there's no 

257.31 262.33 B: no big incentive you know you go and you get through it because you have to 

262.11 263.12 A: uh-huh 

262.99 266.67 B: and ah anyway that's my opinion so now [laughter] 

265.96 267.97 A: [laughter] 

267.39 268.85 B: what do you think 

269.67 273.32 A: well when i went to high school especially middle school in high school um 

273.30 278.98 A: of course i've you know i've i've always loved to learn so i i love taking challenging 

278.83 281.91 A: courses and i took a lot of my education seriously but 

281.75 294.06 A: i just notice that because of the lack of i guess um some of some of the teachers like you said there are some that are highly dedicated but because of some of the lack of motivation for some of the teachers 

293.92 298.39 A: it just ended up being like a farm house you know there'd be students that 

298.26 304.07 A: they you know i had an an algebra class actually in high school and the teacher talked about baseball the whole time 

303.83 310.52 A: and so he'd give us our assignments and then talk with like those that were on the baseball team and football team about sports all the time 

310.36 324.19 A: which wasn't necessarily bad but it just wasn't very productive for our time and so i i think i think with the public system i mean there's flaws and i wish like i think if i don't how since they're spending so much money on 

313.17 314.19 B: (( right mhm mm )) 

324.30 339.26 A: on you know anti terrorism and so forth right now but um if they could increase maybe the payroll of some of the teachers then it would be more appealing to people out in the you know in the job market to become teachers especially when they have a talent to teach really well 

339.08 340.39 B: yeah well 

339.29 340.51 A: and so 

340.56 341.90 A: i think ah 

342.01 350.28 A: that's how you can improve public education a lot is maybe by paying the teachers more so it's more appealing and and also making it more organized 

348.23 348.94 B: but 

349.06 351.75 B: but i think is they need to be worth their pay 

351.67 352.73 A: right 

352.05 355.21 B: you know so the criteria needs to be stricter maybe though 

355.10 357.31 A: yeah i would agree 

356.97 361.68 B: for the for them to become teachers and you know because not just anybody can do it 

361.23 362.22 A: uh-huh 

361.73 369.15 B: um and it has to be people that are very um oriented with kids it can't just be you 

369.64 370.93 B: know someone that's 

371.52 374.63 B: just smart you know what i mean [laughter] 

373.90 375.33 A: right [laughter] 

374.71 378.75 B: someone who's willing to who's good with the kids and to get right down there 

378.89 385.29 B: you know and sometimes the older teachers just don't have it you know th- the kids just don't respect them 

385.20 386.62 A: right 

385.84 386.96 B: and ah 

387.37 389.39 B: they have to keep that respect 

389.97 392.91 B: and and that's another thing i see in public school 

393.01 397.49 B: is that it seems like there's so little respect for each other 

397.37 398.39 A: uh-huh 

397.82 401.45 B: and for teachers and um 

402.02 405.14 B: you know they're they're because they have to be there 

404.92 405.93 A: uh-huh 

405.32 407.66 B: and the teachers know they have to be there 

407.28 408.31 A: uh-huh 

407.73 409.08 B: you know it's kind of like 

410.39 413.22 B: like you said where's the motivation where's the 

413.41 415.21 B: you know what's in it for the kids 

416.49 418.28 B: so and they don't realise 

418.31 422.02 B: going through especially in high school at that age that um 

422.78 424.93 B: life is is just beginning 

425.23 427.85 B: and they're responsible from this point out 

427.74 429.24 A: right 

428.27 433.08 B: and ah it's going to take them some time little longer to realise that 

433.14 441.40 B: you know you're twenty two you're getting to the age where um you're probably seeing it now you know i wish i maybe didn't do that or 

441.56 445.57 B: i'm glad i learned from doing that [laughter] type of thing 

444.14 445.37 A: uh-huh 

445.41 446.35 A: uh-huh 

446.02 447.04 B: um 

448.04 449.05 B: so 

449.10 453.77 B: yeah and i wish i'd say the same but i ca- you know i'm i'm in my forties so 

453.46 454.37 A: uh-huh 

454.44 455.50 B: um 

455.77 457.50 B: i look back and say 

458.38 465.55 B: you know i went to private school and i tried to help kids i had a my best friend was in public school 

465.65 467.72 B: and i was a grade ahead of her 

467.75 473.74 B: as far as our school work but we were in the same grade we were both in fifth grade or whatever 

471.08 472.01 A: really 

473.80 477.76 B: and i could help her with her homework because i had already done that 

478.15 481.02 B: and i'm in i was in private school she was in public school 

480.90 482.96 A: so you were a grade ahead of her [laughter] 

481.36 482.22 B: (( you know )) 

482.31 485.90 B: and so even though according to the public school 

486.13 487.18 B: standards 

488.17 492.18 B: to me she was doing like fourth grade work and she was in the fifth grade 

492.50 497.27 B: and i was you know i could help her with her subjects because i'd already had all that 

497.02 498.00 A: uh-huh 

497.59 502.36 B: and so i you know that's where i think that the private school you get a better education 

502.81 506.99 B: and and public school they they have to you know 

507.08 509.87 B: the kids have to be there but they also need to learn 

509.74 510.70 A: uh-huh 

509.92 511.91 B: and they have to make it fun for the kids 

511.79 512.74 A: uh-huh 

512.05 512.87 B: (( you know )) 

512.91 515.05 B: and yet life isn't all fun so 

515.91 517.49 B: they have to um 

517.78 518.72 B: learn 

519.29 520.67 B: you know starting then 

521.78 524.14 B: so i have children in ah 

524.44 526.89 B: at school age in private school 

526.90 531.13 B: and there's no way that i would put them in public school you know as long as i can 

531.87 536.40 B: continue to afford it because of the because of the um 

536.79 539.02 B: drugs and the 

539.28 541.12 B: the language 

541.29 542.90 B: and the disrespect 

542.73 543.77 A: uh-huh 

543.35 546.22 B: of the teachers and and um 

546.97 550.23 B: just just some friends that i had that went to public school 

550.68 554.18 B: you know i i i and being religious people it's 

556.77 559.92 B: like i said though you can't rule everybody out 

559.65 560.92 A: right 

561.47 562.25 B: (( so )) 

562.80 566.14 B: did ah you feel like you got a good education mhm 

566.37 572.06 A: i felt i did i had a i was you know by most of my teachers i was 

571.87 585.60 A: i was impressed because they weren't in it for the money obviously um well i'm in utah and and ah especially in the county the district that i attended public school it was like the lowest paying in the entire country at the time 

585.45 597.31 A: and so or one of the lowest and so i really knew that they weren't in it for the money but again you know i think you bought up some interesting points like something that i thought could have 

597.40 599.95 A: that could have been done better was just i
