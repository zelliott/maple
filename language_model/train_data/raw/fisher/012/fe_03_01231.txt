0.43 2.35 A: regina edmondson 

1.82 4.37 B: hello my name is elliott walls 

4.13 5.07 A: oh hi 

5.02 8.83 B: hello um so what do you think about this policy [noise] 

9.00 11.13 A: oh i think it's a pretty good one i've 

11.19 16.17 A: i'm a big thing on ah [laughter] hiring within the community and doing different things like that 

13.31 13.88 B: (( mm )) 

16.24 17.81 B: (( okay okay um )) 

17.84 22.44 B: well initially um i used to think that affirmative action was a great thing um 

22.28 25.36 B: just a couple of years back but recently i've been convinced 

25.15 38.36 B: that um it would be better in fact if businesses could hire just whoever they think is best for the job and not necessarily based and like um stipulate like a quota or something based on race or um any other sort of 

38.21 40.86 B: like other discriminating factors 

40.72 54.09 A: yeah i've noticed that quite a bit of that's going on in different places since i've been involved with the chamber of commerce there's certain places that you know go right on with whatever they think's going to fit into their company instead of the right person 

45.94 47.02 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

51.71 52.51 B: mm 

54.20 55.70 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

54.73 61.23 A: i've definitely noticed that some some places are doing pretty good hiring the person who's actually qualified for the job 

56.45 58.31 B: yeah 

60.97 61.74 B: mm 

62.39 67.99 B: yeah i personally think that that's the best option even though like i'm a i'm an asian american and um 

67.95 82.81 B: um i don't know if well actually in today's society i don't even know if that puts me at a disadvantage or actually at an advantage but i don't think um affirmative action is something that really is necessary in most um like at least most more like cosmopolitan 

83.01 91.83 B: in the states like if you're looking for a job in new york city um generally i don't think race or anything makes a difference anymore but i don't know 

90.95 91.69 A: well 

91.75 94.11 A: i know in some places here 

94.95 109.31 A: well some places that i've noticed around where i live they're hiring it seems like based on ah different religions and things like that but yeah and it- it's a strange strange thing ah you know we used to have i used to work at a human resources place 

97.64 98.44 B: okay 

102.05 103.39 B: (( oh really okay mm )) 

107.03 108.70 B: (( [noise] )) 

109.12 109.98 B: (( mm )) 

109.34 123.72 A: and a like a temporary place and ah they used to have different policies for different companies and i never could understand why they did have and i always thought well you know it's it's a neat thing everybody knows what they want you know for their company 

111.53 112.43 B: (( okay )) 

123.73 132.50 A: you know so i i was really a firm believer in it and then i got to thinking ah you know maybe not i don't know because i've been out of it for a long time so 

129.99 131.62 B: (( all )) 

131.90 133.26 B: (( right [noise] )) 

133.32 144.60 B: oh well it sounds like you have a lot more experience in this kind of respect than i do because i'm still in school so i'm i'm not really quite yet exposed to the whole climate the business climate yet ah 

143.86 147.33 A: so ah what are you training for you training for human resources 

147.05 159.86 B: um no actually i'm just um i i i'm i'm actually i'm studying japanese right now [noise] but um yeah [laughter] i guess maybe i got the phone call because i am an asian american i don't know 

154.05 154.86 A: oh 

155.80 157.00 A: [laughter] 

159.83 160.92 A: oh really 

160.09 163.43 B: (( yeah maybe i guess [noise] ah )) 

162.72 174.06 A: well you know that well it it could be i guess because if you're going to be getting involved in any kind of business one time or another you're going to have to either interview somebody or you're going to have to visit with somebody on a job 

166.97 167.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

170.17 171.93 B: (( mm [noise] yeah )) 

172.78 177.85 B: (( yeah [noise] yeah sure [noise] yeah )) 

174.47 179.04 A: you know and you're going to have to make a decision on whether they can actually do the job or not 

178.29 180.58 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

179.34 182.93 A: and a lot of companies still have that policy of affirmative action 

182.57 185.48 B: (( yeah [noise] sure )) 

183.37 185.91 A: quite a few of the more corporate companies 

185.29 201.94 B: mhm 

186.81 191.57 A: so that's there [laughter] that is kind of strange isn't it [laughter] 

192.87 198.51 A: but we've we've already always did the ah you know each company has their own profile 

198.63 200.75 A: that you have to go by some ah 

201.01 210.36 A: specialty companies you have to put in your height your weight your age you know what what color the skin is what type of religion you know even what kind of shoes you wear 

210.75 223.15 B: interesting yeah so does that does that information usually end up getting used in ah in the selection of your of the candidates or anything or just 

210.83 214.02 A: which to me is a little bit too technical [laughter] 

221.27 225.75 A: well i think if let's say if you're going to do an acting job yeah 

225.11 227.86 B: oh yeah true definitely 

226.68 236.09 A: you know but if you're if you're going to be ah sitting behind a desk talking on a telephone i can't see what your height your weight or what the color of your skin is you know it's going to matter 

233.73 239.01 B: (( [noise] no exactly yeah )) 

236.26 243.43 A: you know so but i guess ah some companies just feel that you know they've got a a scheme that you need to fit into 

243.28 244.85 B: yeah well i 

243.84 244.85 A: that's my 

244.92 247.63 B: yeah 

245.65 259.62 A: you know so that's my kind of opinion on on some companies not all of them i think they do it like there's ah merchandising jobs or mystery shopping jobs that where you need to fit a certain critique to go into mystery shopper something like that 

248.96 249.77 B: mm 

253.91 254.58 B: (( mm )) 

258.13 258.73 B: (( mm )) 

259.56 260.34 B: true 

259.97 264.34 A: so have you ever been interviewed to the point where somebody's asked you questions like that 

264.18 274.26 B: um not really no i've only been like a waiter before and then there was just a very like druid sort of job summer job and it really wasn't that big of deal um 

273.43 274.29 A: and 

274.32 277.53 A: and you didn't have to fill out that kind of information on your application 

277.35 278.66 B: no not at all 

278.47 279.81 A: oh well that's good 

278.74 289.48 B: well i don't know that that was in this was in taipei in taiwan so i guess the entire climate well there's not as much racial diversity in taiwan or religious diversity or anything else there is 

289.58 293.32 B: there is in the states so i guess it's not that much of an issue 

293.06 296.90 A: mhm well i know here in a lot of places there's you know different 

297.11 310.19 A: like i say again different companies have these different criterias they go by and you know there's still companies that are that are to me a little more prejudiced than you know they should be for the for the day and the time you know 

301.77 302.41 B: (( um )) 

309.14 311.69 B: yeah yeah 

310.16 319.15 A: and so they do they will put on the application different things that i learned in school was you know you cannot ask it's illegal to ask 

317.69 320.23 B: (( [laughter] oh okay )) 

319.10 331.67 A: but they still you know you can't ask if someone's married you can't ask that ah yeah that's illegal yeah you just cannot do it you cannot ah you're not supposed to be able to ask religion 

323.20 324.54 B: [noise] oh really 

325.17 326.41 B: (( oh okay )) 

331.75 337.23 A: you know or political ah beliefs that's you know just taboo you can't do it 

331.75 333.30 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

334.40 335.14 B: mm 

337.89 338.96 A: but a lot 

338.21 339.19 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

339.29 345.84 B: um sorry i was just wondering um if you might have noticed any patterns like is there are these kind of 

345.97 355.74 B: if like in a certain industry like companies tend to be more prying about personal details or if like or if it's just kind of random with different companies 

355.29 360.81 A: well in in doing the temporary work that i did it was kind of random it'd be kind of hit and miss 

359.68 361.49 B: (( okay okay )) 

360.85 362.55 A: you know they'd ah yeah 

361.55 365.33 B: so there'd be companies in all different industries that did this it's not like 

364.42 366.14 A: yeah yeah 

366.66 371.81 A: yeah we'd have ah it it like i say it seemed like more of the the big corporate companies 

366.70 367.43 B: (( okay )) 

370.20 375.48 B: (( oh mhm )) 

371.86 372.86 A: you know 

373.28 384.00 A: i i kind of thought it you know in my way of thinking of course i might think different than other people i always thought that they had the same that they went by they wanted certain people in there and certain people not 

383.94 394.01 A: it's you know the feeling that i got we had some people from india that interviewed for us one time and they were perf- they had the perfect skills for a job but didn't get it 

386.06 386.87 B: (( mm mm )) 

389.54 391.26 B: mhm 

393.66 394.61 B: wow 

393.96 403.17 A: because they had another interview with the actual company that was hiring us and they did not let them have the job and that kind of made me wonder you know why they had the skills 

397.57 398.92 B: oh okay 

402.56 403.83 B: yeah 

403.10 412.99 A: you know they had the experience they had the the you know the the professional look attitude you know everything but they didn't get it and it always to this day it made me wonder you know if 

408.22 408.93 B: (( mm )) 

412.19 414.34 B: (( that's really interesting )) 

413.70 416.77 A: yeah i it it you know and we've had ah 

417.06 424.34 A: you know just just different people from different areas or walks of life that didn't get the job that were actually perfect for it 

424.48 425.41 A: you know 

425.10 435.36 B: wow can i can i ask just um where it was that you had your job like wh- where these companies were based sort of thing i don't ah you know [noise] 

425.70 426.75 A: and 

433.07 439.76 A: well ah the company the company that i worked for was called benchmark at diversified group 

435.27 445.41 B: (( mhm )) 

439.75 450.76 A: and they had contracts with the companies from all over like st louis and springfield and stuff like that and we were not privy to their actual name we could only do the interviewing and so 

448.05 449.45 B: (( all right okay okay )) 

449.70 453.65 B: (( okay okay sure [noise] )) 

452.61 467.03 A: so that kind of you know [laughter] that's one of the reasons why i'm not with them anymore [laughter] because i don't go for that [laughter] if you're qualified to do the job you know yeah exac- you know i'm the type of person if you're qualified to do the job go do it you know 

456.36 468.86 B: [laughter] oh okay [laughter] yeah good for you good for you yeah 

466.88 471.18 A: if you're not you know go to school learn how to do it then come back [laughter] 

469.24 478.97 B: right come back yeah yeah i used to think that that should be the way it is and and if companies hired based on that kind of an attitude 

472.02 472.90 A: [laughter] 

478.76 487.96 B: then there would be no n- need for affirmative action so i guess you know all companies don't necessarily do that but yeah 

486.38 495.03 A: well it you know like i say in some cases i i kind of do in ways agree with affirmative action depending on the job scope itself 

491.47 498.49 B: (( mhm mm )) 

495.14 501.57 A: you know if there if there are certain certain requirements certain physical requirements you know like say in acting 

501.71 503.31 A: like like i said before 

503.12 516.96 A: yeah that's fine you know if it requires you know the ten foot tall person or whatever the case is you know [laughter] go for it but in in regular corporative ah fields and stuff i can't see it because nine times out of ten 

504.98 509.80 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

510.33 512.03 B: (( yeah )) 

515.20 517.05 B: yeah 

516.78 526.05 A: you're not meeting ah people to get other people's opinion because you know how people across the united states and other countries have different opinions on what you should look like 

525.85 527.78 B: yeah 

525.96 531.14 A: you know or or be like you know so to me unless they're hiring and paying your 

530.96 537.81 A: your paycheck or actually living with you there's not a lot of opinion other people should have [laughter] of course i you know 

535.79 537.44 B: yeah 

537.57 546.81 A: like i say i've got a difference of opinion so i haven't been in hu- ah human resources in about three years so a lot of a lot of laws and things might have changed 

543.70 544.50 B: (( oh )) 

545.81 548.26 B: might have changed yeah 

547.22 549.73 A: yeah so you know in my opinion 

550.08 554.51 A: you know like i said if you're qualified do it if you're not get the qualifications 

550.36 559.06 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

554.74 555.54 A: so 

556.38 567.22 A: but ah i don't know if ah i don't know if affirmative action's something that they're going to change in the near future like i said some places did have it and some places should not 

567.28 569.34 A: should not but you know 

569.38 570.82 B: yeah because 

571.69 574.74 B: (( where i see i was going to say something before i forgot )) 

574.71 578.60 A: well i'm a blabber mouth blah blah blah [laughter] [laughter] 

574.83 575.57 B: (( so )) 

576.05 579.20 B: (( no no no no it's good no )) 

579.45 581.46 B: yeah um 

580.28 581.08 A: so 

581.28 591.85 B: yeah oh yeah that's right because um i remember when i was applying for colleges and they had people put ah photographs in their um applications like head shots of kids 

591.65 599.95 B: and i thought i i totally thought it was completely unnecessary and i didn't really see why they would have people do it because i don't know i just
