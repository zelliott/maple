11.71 12.67 B: okay 

13.07 18.04 A: yes i think there's something seriously wrong with the public school system the pu- um 

18.18 25.43 A: i'm a single parent and i have to spend a third of my income to put my daughter through a private school because of the public school system 

25.65 34.49 A: was so bad so horrible that i feared for my daughter's well being while in the school system and we are in a good school district 

35.18 37.44 A: what can be done about it god only knows 

37.53 39.58 A: i have no idea um 

39.89 43.00 A: how about paying the administrators less 

43.28 51.66 A: having fewer of them maybe if they care more about their jobs and they care more about kids and paying the teachers a little more 

52.27 54.92 A: i don't i other than that i don't know what else to do 

55.23 57.85 B: oh well okay my turn 

55.65 56.54 A: your turn 

57.88 65.75 B: um well i i put my children through a public school because where i came from the public school offered them the better education 

66.10 67.10 B: um 

67.15 77.21 B: i'll guess it's going to make a difference where we grow up in or when we raise our children i also am a single parent i raised three children sent them all the way through the public school 

76.85 78.73 A: where do you live that the public's 

77.86 82.93 B: um i live in a a small town in north west iowa and you're from 

82.75 84.54 A: ooh i'm in texas 

84.11 85.67 B: in a large town 

85.39 86.40 A: austin 

86.42 87.36 B: okay 

86.47 90.16 A: actually i i'm in a twenty a town of twenty thousand people cedar park 

89.72 90.68 B: okay 

90.73 95.33 B: and i don't even have two thousand people in my town [laughter] so 

93.52 95.19 A: wow 

95.36 96.55 B: so i'm 

95.67 98.32 A: so your schools just sounds good then you don't 

97.54 109.10 B: right our school system was wonderful for my kids i say that i i was a single parent like i said and and if i wasn't available after school my boys helped the janitor and he'd see to it they'd get home 

108.75 110.44 A: wow 

109.41 112.45 B: i mean and and they had a great education 

112.34 114.64 A: how many students per class 

112.52 113.34 B: they were 

114.33 115.35 B: um 

115.38 117.67 B: well my boys graduated 

118.01 122.68 B: my my middle son had his largest class the largest class in their school 

122.75 124.80 B: and there was a hundred and [sigh] 

124.96 126.01 B: twenty 

125.62 130.57 A: (( wow that sounds wonderful )) 

126.29 127.65 B: that graduated 

128.10 128.88 B: so 

129.17 133.73 B: my daughter didn't even have a hundred kids in her class and to me that was a big class because 

132.91 136.65 A: oh well see there you have it you know the personal attention 

134.74 135.61 B: yeah 

136.35 142.32 B: right they got the individual attention the teachers could see they were having trouble the teachers gave their all from them 

138.17 139.21 A: mhm 

142.40 150.90 A: well my problem is my daughter is very gifted and the public school systems here were overcrowded so what they do is they cater to the 

142.54 143.38 B: so 

144.80 146.01 B: mhm 

150.92 162.11 A: the mediocre children and the children that are falling through the cracks and the gifted kids are bored to tears and don't do well and they're you know it's just all crammed in 

162.30 168.78 A: and my daughter's won national awards for science um for stem cell research papers 

168.79 171.34 A: so she's not it's not like sh- 

170.80 171.66 B: no 

171.40 175.64 A: and she'd always done well until she went to this high school that was overcrowded that had 

175.66 178.34 A: you know forty children per teacher 

178.14 178.83 B: (( mm )) 

178.61 184.30 A: in the class there was over fifteen hundred children at this high school 

179.12 179.79 B: [laughter] 

184.55 185.39 B: wow 

184.65 188.19 A: they had to have portables out in the back so it was really really bad 

188.04 193.47 B: so now now the question we're supposed to decide here you know is it the school or the area they live in 

193.43 195.08 A: well you know 

194.15 198.42 B: you know the public schools they got enough teachers to get the you know 

198.77 201.79 A: right exactly i guess it depends on the size of the city 

201.43 210.08 B: right because our public schools like in middle school they have a programme for the honor students and you know they have they have parents who come in and work with them 

208.45 211.65 A: well we have that h- we have that here too 

211.75 218.07 A: but it gets to the point where well see texas is really bad first of all i would never recommend anybody move to texas [laughter] 

217.38 219.57 B: [laughter] i'm not moving there 

219.08 229.21 A: yeah if you're if you're not ah well see it's a very re- we're in the bible belt up here and people are very religious so most of their children go to school in religious schools anyway 

224.17 224.90 B: (( mm )) 

229.46 235.83 A: but um the public school system is pretty much just a babysitter for the poor or the people who don't care 

235.42 236.40 B: okay 

236.09 246.80 A: whereas in phoenix where my daughter went to school my daughter went to a school in a really good school system grade one through five that was second in the nation as far as academics 

246.77 257.70 A: and she did real well she loved it it wasn't too full it was very nice but one school district over had the worst district in the nation [laughter] so 

255.69 257.03 B: oh okay 

258.34 265.55 A: i don't know what that means is it the people who are running it i mean the superintendents where does it start 

264.94 268.29 B: it i would i'm going to have to go along with the administration 

268.15 269.80 A: yeah i think so too 

268.69 269.56 B: (( you know )) 

269.68 272.20 B: are they there because they care about the kids 

272.69 275.60 A: and then that attitude just rolls all the way down the aisle 

275.35 278.72 B: right because if the administration doesn't back you up 

276.04 277.01 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

278.99 285.88 B: see i i did teach for a couple of years you know lower elementary many um twenty thirty years ago 

283.70 285.47 A: oh wow great 

286.14 291.67 B: and you know i had a wonderful school everybody cared how was my classroom going you know how were things going 

289.87 290.96 A: mhm 

291.71 294.82 B: i was the new teacher on the block and we had all kinds of help 

295.07 297.89 B: but everybody cared about the kids you know 

295.14 296.15 A: (( what )) 

297.01 298.46 A: were you in public 

298.26 301.06 B: i was in a private school when i started 

299.75 301.63 A: oh private okay okay 

301.48 309.72 B: so but i went to a public school raised my kids in a public school i had the choice and that was my choice in my area that was the better choice 

309.42 316.82 A: right well the public school here they lost my kid and tried to convince me that my straight a honor roll student had run away 

316.76 317.50 B: mm 

316.99 327.14 A: when actually there was an assembly that everybody in the office all the way from the receptionist to the principal conveniently forgot simultaneously 

327.58 328.15 B: (( mm )) 

328.17 333.65 A: um so i was none too happy and that was the final straw for me and i can't really afford to put my daughter through 

333.79 337.78 A: private school but quite frankly i can't afford not to at this point 

337.17 338.18 B: right 

337.95 343.45 A: and um the one thing i really like about this private school there's only nine kids in ninth grade 

343.87 351.07 A: and they're all very close teachers are very good they don't make a lot of money but they're very concerned about the kids 

351.10 352.52 A: my daughter 

352.60 357.35 A: has made friends with them they made friend- she goes to this there's there's this one little girl who's from 

358.02 362.17 A: and she has bible study and she's having a hard time with the bible because you know 

362.49 368.61 A: speaks in the king's english instead of regular and she had the hard enough time with the english language as it is 

365.62 366.56 B: right 

368.14 369.21 B: mhm 

369.00 373.51 A: so i went on the internet and i found a a bible 

373.77 378.16 A: and my daughter took it to school and gave it to her to help her out [laughter] 

377.55 380.14 B: right and n- now she's doing much better 

379.64 381.32 A: yeah she's doing much better 

380.43 386.01 B: but no th- they care i can see that where private school kids care more they get more as a group 

386.11 387.69 B: a very small room 

386.95 389.54 A: is it do you think it's because they get more money 

391.01 394.42 A: oh the air raid sirens over baghdad 

391.58 392.67 B: the teachers 

394.05 395.06 B: they what 

394.59 396.65 A: air raid sirens over baghdad 

396.03 401.97 B: i heard that about five minutes ago already so depends on which channel you're watching a._b._c. had it on first 

397.71 398.97 A: oh my gosh

404.22 406.09 A: yeah i'm on fox 

405.74 409.36 B: oh oh that's a little behind a._b._c. yet so 

408.53 412.21 A: yeah wow okay 

409.76 414.72 B: but bye bye i haven't heard that we're doing anything but that's not our subject right 

414.72 417.04 A: oh no i'm sorry okay so any way 

414.81 415.75 B: okay 

415.84 419.16 B: so what you how many how many kids do you have in school 

418.94 420.31 A: ah just the one 

420.24 421.19 B: just one 

420.89 426.65 A: just the one but i i went through public school system too and the school system that i went to 

421.87 423.71 B: see now and in 

426.92 431.01 A: the year that i graduated they produced the most um 

431.08 433.76 A: illiterate children in the nation that year 

433.84 443.88 A: isn't that wonderful i'm so proud [laughter] yeah i was really proud to hear that so i thought oh thank you yes yes yes 

433.85 434.54 B: (( mm )) 

435.07 436.35 B: uh-huh right 

436.80 440.23 B: just what you wanted to be a class of huh [laughter] well 

443.68 446.64 B: well see all three of mine are now going to college 

446.30 448.16 A: oh that's wonderful 

446.86 450.77 B: but out of that two of them chose private colleges 

450.40 451.86 A: oh that's wonderful 

450.93 453.21 B: one went to a state university 

453.23 456.22 B: now they all went to the same high school you know 

456.56 460.29 B: but i say that out of those two they went to the private school 

460.10 461.11 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

460.47 470.90 B: because they grew up with the small classes and everything they would never have made it at a state university the one that chose to he was the outgoing kid he could make it you know and he did 

463.27 464.46 A: oh sure 

471.01 471.89 A: right 

471.24 476.31 B: but they're all in college well my daughter's bounced around three or four different ones she doesn't know what she wants to do 

476.16 477.47 A: right 

476.38 480.90 B: but i i don't know what her problem is some days [laughter] 

480.14 486.06 A: right the private schools well you know hey [laughter] they get used to smaller classes i think that's better 

485.72 486.99 B: right 

486.35 490.75 A: and i can see the state state uni- the universities being harder for them 

490.41 491.43 B: mhm 

491.47 495.78 B: but yet i'm i'm close to people who have their children in the private schools here 

495.82 499.86 B: and some of those kids make it at the state universities and become honor students 

498.26 499.10 A: well you 

499.26 504.43 A: yeah but your public school is like a private school [laughter] 

501.61 505.87 B: oh yeah [laughter] well you should see how small our private schools are here then 

504.83 507.44 A: may maybe i should move to a smaller 

507.48 509.80 A: a smaller town maybe i'd do better 

507.55 508.50 B: (( well yeah ah )) 

510.08 518.83 B: it's a possibility you know if you can find them see our a as my kids were growing up two of the school districts joined together the public school districts to make one 

519.30 523.63 B: and i said it was harder on us parents who grew up and we were rivals forever 

523.83 524.68 A: right 

524.34 528.59 B: instead all our students are all in the same boat and they say okay you guys are going to get along now 

528.72 534.28 B: you know there is there's no more rivalry the town's three miles apart and we don't argue with each other anymore [laughter] we all get 

533.74 535.36 A: that's wonderful though 

534.98 539.89 B: the kids did great the parents from time to time still have problems 

538.23 539.46 A: [laughter] 

539.62 542.12 A: yeah the parents are always the worst though aren't they 

541.07 542.98 B: (( yeah but )) 

543.27 548.92 B: you know but i said my kids had opportunities i know they would not have had you know 

547.68 548.79 A: right
