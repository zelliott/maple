1.57 3.21 A: hi i'm megan 

3.77 4.77 B: hi megan 

4.42 5.50 A: (( [laughter] hi )) 

5.00 6.72 B: do we just start talking now 

6.53 7.93 A: i think so 

7.44 9.85 B: okay this is my first call so 

9.65 10.70 A: me too 

10.47 13.05 B: wow we're newbies then 

12.66 13.73 A: (( oh really )) 

13.70 21.14 B: h- how did you get hooked up oh we're not supposed to talk about that uh current events how do you uh keep informed about current events 

16.55 17.35 A: oh 

21.01 21.94 A: (( um )) 

22.36 28.60 A: i used to read the newspaper all the time but i don't get it any more at college so 

28.93 32.61 A: um on the internet usually if there's a 

33.09 37.86 A: news story on m._s._n. or something i that sounds interesting i'll click on it but 

38.01 42.79 A: i don't keep in touch with the news as much as i should so 

42.71 48.15 B: not as much as you should that's kinda questionable i'm actually quite frustrated with the news right now 

47.70 48.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

48.42 50.34 B: i uh i was a 

50.88 54.98 B: [sigh] uh my husband calls me a public radio junkie [laughter] 

54.33 56.02 A: oh yeah 

55.04 67.09 B: and probably about six months or so as the news turned more and more to war and it seemed like seven out of ten stories were about the impending crisis in iraq i just got more and more 

65.44 66.41 A: mhm 

67.86 81.48 B: [sigh] uh disenchanted i think it's like um it's a shame that there's nothing else going on in the world that's worthy of reporting so i kinda stopped listening to that and now t._v. news just drives me crazy because it's more like uh 

74.80 76.60 A: yeah yeah i agree 

81.49 83.35 B: infotainment and 

82.65 84.23 A: mhm 

83.62 88.58 B: [laughter] and like a reality show than like news programming so 

87.68 88.61 A: yeah 

88.64 98.18 B: and it's a shame like even you know c._n._n. or or some of the more respected news outlets are just really playing it up for all it's worth and i don't appreciate that 

98.25 101.23 A: that's true i never i didn't think about that really 

100.71 108.20 B: yeah it's um it's interesting i mean i guess i enjoy like some of the commentary about how the news has changed over the past 

108.24 109.12 A: uh-huh 

108.65 114.88 B: you know umpteen years they've talked quite a bit now about the difference between how this war is covered versus [sigh] 

115.43 117.19 B: you know the first uh 

117.20 126.40 B: gulf interaction and and um vietnam and whatever and even world war two and that type of thing i enjoy but it's like 

119.06 120.00 A: uh-huh 

127.10 140.20 B: i don't need to know the play by play of where people are and how they plan to do things and isn't that kind of odd to talk about well you know tomorrow they'll be making surgical strikes on blah blah blah 'cause doesn't that kinda defeat the purpose of war [laughter] 

137.21 138.17 A: yeah 

139.35 147.89 A: i know i i don't understand that either like that's all they've been saying really like what they're gonna do next and 

144.31 145.29 B: (( yeah )) 

147.38 152.24 B: and i actually find it very hilarious that now like every t._v. news program has this 

152.52 156.38 B: you know giant floor map that they can walk around [laughter] 

155.74 156.74 A: uh-huh 

156.71 164.86 B: anyway my news program was just on tonight or i should say my husband's and they're doing this on our local t._v. channel and i'm like i wonder how much that cost 'em you know 

164.37 165.95 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

165.64 168.04 B: bet they just get that from the network news 

168.07 169.13 A: mhm 

169.05 174.81 B: anyway so um hm so reading the paper well that's ambitious 

171.78 172.77 A: [laughter] 

174.69 182.88 A: yeah i used to be really interested in international development and foreign affairs and i was thinking about studying that at college but 

182.47 183.76 B: mhm 

183.36 184.38 A: i 

184.79 187.53 A: decided not to [laughter] so i haven't 

187.65 192.77 A: been that involved with the news any more international affairs and stuff but 

192.14 196.17 B: so you obviously didn't read your local paper then or [laughter] 

195.34 204.33 A: no i use- i was in an international relations class and we always read like the major the new york and california papers and [lipsmack] 

203.87 205.18 B: mhm 

204.70 209.07 A: washington post and stuff but not since then i haven't really 

209.44 212.50 B: so it was mostly your interest was developed through the class then 

212.42 213.51 A: yeah 

213.07 214.17 B: (( well that's cool )) 

215.48 219.75 B: (( [lipsmack] so [laughter] how many more minutes do we have )) 

219.37 221.19 A: i don't know um 

220.16 227.55 B: this is so interesting what about i mean do you do like radio news or the internet obviously is very interesting 

221.83 222.99 A: let's see 

225.19 226.62 A: yeah i like 

227.60 230.17 A: i used to i usually listen to 

230.19 234.13 A: um the talk radio on the way home from work [laughter] 

233.26 234.70 B: mhm 

234.33 235.80 A: and 

235.21 240.57 B: (( yeah that's better than hearing the same music over and over and over and over and over but that's just my opinion )) 

238.99 240.11 A: [laughter] 

240.51 241.80 A: yeah 

241.12 248.28 B: yeah i actually um the night that the attacks were launched um what was that last wednesday night 

247.98 248.98 A: mhm 

248.51 258.90 B: um i was taking a train home with my kids taking a short vacation over their spring break and they of course made the announcement on over the train's intercom that you know 

253.93 254.79 A: uh-huh 

259.15 262.32 B: (( we're bombing baghdad and the whole train you know went oh )) 

262.48 263.73 A: oh no 

262.82 276.82 B: oh but i just i used speaking of how to get your news i uh i used my brand new internet cell phone and was able to read the story so [laughter] you know god bless technology woo hoo i could read about 

270.17 271.23 A: ooh 

271.63 273.02 A: nice 

275.21 276.35 A: yeah i've never 

276.38 279.31 A: i don't have a cell phone so how does that work like you can just 

278.30 285.01 B: how does that work um well it's very very limited internet stuff it's more like you know subscribing to a news group or something 

284.51 285.39 A: uh-huh 

285.29 296.51 B: um but it's really great because um it's you basically just you know push a button and they connect you to kinda their limited internet service but it's got yellow pages and it's got 

294.54 295.51 A: oh 

296.46 303.58 B: you know like movie listings which is fabulous it's got current events and club events and then it's got a news service so 

299.34 300.20 A: oh 

303.63 313.27 B: i mean you know my the screen of course is you know all of an inch tall [laughter] so you read like three lines and push a button and read three more lines it's not the quickest way to get your news but 

307.19 308.09 A: yeah 

312.31 313.24 A: uh-huh 

313.17 319.15 B: i mean being i guess in an isolated circumstance where there was no t._v. no radio or anything else kind of an interesting way 

319.02 320.01 A: wow 

319.36 321.63 B: to access the news 

321.01 323.64 A: mhm i was in mexico 

323.67 328.98 A: actually when we heard like the whole thing when they when he gave the forty eight hour 

328.56 329.87 B: yeah 

329.27 331.27 A: whatever it was um 

331.44 337.06 A: yeah and so we were all freaking out like they're gonna close the borders and we won't get back and 

335.90 344.82 B: [laughter] wouldn't be that bad would it i mean it's like you know on a perpetual spring break for a while i suppose it might get kinda old [laughter] 

338.78 340.30 A: [laughter] 

340.59 341.17 A: (( yeah )) 

343.61 347.16 A: (( [laughter] long spring break )) 

345.04 346.39 B: that's funny it was 

346.86 350.01 B: actually one of the better speeches i thought he'd given but 

349.31 351.31 A: mhm yeah i agree 

351.10 355.11 B: definitely he's such an interesting public speaker [laughter] 

353.98 356.38 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

356.58 369.87 B: he didn't fumble any words that time at least um let's see t._v. radio news phone what other ways oh talking to people is there a lot of talk um on your campus about the war or protests anything like that 

358.95 359.97 A: yeah 

368.93 372.07 A: yeah they had a whole bunch of protests um 

372.09 379.81 A: before every anything ever happened like there was there were like every day you would hear people yelling and um i know 

374.26 375.42 B: yeah 

377.70 378.38 B: (( mm )) 

378.58 382.78 B: you mean like pro peace or you mean like pro peace or how did it 

379.96 380.81 A: what 

382.02 385.45 A: yes yes i yeah all of 'em were 

383.54 384.19 B: (( okay )) 

385.49 394.12 A: we don't support bush we don't support the war at all and one of the girls i work with her boyfriend um lives in san francisco and he 

388.39 389.12 B: huh 

393.66 394.84 B: oh 

394.13 398.21 A: is also a really active [laughter] uh [laughter] 

395.77 399.94 B: uh-oh [laughter] has he spent any time in jail lately [laughter] 

398.87 404.06 A: [laughter] i think he got like hurt at one of 'em i something he got 

402.74 404.47 B: oh no [noise] 

404.13 407.19 A: bashed in the face or i don't remember but he 

406.82 408.77 B: i'm sure he wears it with a badge of honor 

408.42 410.70 A: yeah he's probably proud of it but 

409.04 410.23 B: [laughter] 

411.05 415.89 A: keep up on that she's really into she's not as much as him but um 

416.39 422.51 A: [lipsmack] she tells me like all the stuff she's reading about and so i keep up on it from her a lot 'cause 

422.74 428.47 A: she's and she's a journalism major actually so she's really into it lately but 

426.09 426.89 B: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

427.77 430.87 B: i'm sure she's interested in watching how it's unfolding then 

430.51 431.77 A: mhm 

433.18 441.21 B: (( too yeah huh let's see my friends oh we just we all kind of go yep it's happening but we're still living our lives [laughter] )) 

440.66 441.66 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

441.66 446.39 B: i mean i guess i'm married have kids and i've got my kids are um 

446.73 454.93 B: [lipsmack] they're four and six so you know i've kinda been considering how do you tell them about that obviously you know they see the news 

452.08 453.18 A: yeah 

454.94 464.65 B: occasionally 'cause it's breaking into every darned program they could ever imagine watching which i find kind of ironic that you know newsbreaks in the kids' cartoons 

460.25 461.15 A: uh-huh 

464.37 465.94 A: yeah [laughter] 

465.53 469.48 B: [sigh] let's see who's watching t._v. at that time 

469.54 470.31 B: (( children )) 

470.23 471.94 A: [laughter] 

470.50 475.80 B: so be sure to you know tell them about all the people that'll be getting killed anyway so that's kind of an issue 

475.81 476.99 A: yeah how 

475.99 480.01 B: we talk about um you know how do you talk to your children about that and 

479.38 480.63 A: mhm 

480.61 482.02 B: (( i don't know um )) 

482.07 484.84 A: how did um it go when 

484.89 488.17 A: nine eleven happened like were they old enough to 

487.60 495.22 B: (( not really no um they were well let's see that was two years ago so four and you know two and a half so )) 

489.06 489.99 A: did it 

492.52 493.45 A: yeah 

494.48 495.56 A: okay 

495.71 500.48 B: and i mean that's interesting because um you know i guess there've been a few things in 

500.88 514.64 B: the you know current life of humanity that like everybody remembers where they were [noise] that type of thing you know like with the kennedy assassination and then [sigh] i think that the um the original columbia explosion was one of those i don't know if you were young enough 

505.95 507.01 A: mhm 

508.94 510.04 A: mhm 

514.49 521.72 B: or old enough to remember that but that was probably that was probably the first thing that you know i identified with in that way um 

516.02 517.54 A: (( nope i [laughter] )) 

521.05 521.95 A: uh-huh 

522.48 529.49 B: but then of course there's nine eleven and to think that you know my kids are going to learn about that as opposed to experiencing it's really interesting 

529.55 532.00 A: yeah that is 

531.42 535.86 B: but that actually um i mean talk about news coverage my gosh i was um 

536.28 547.61 B: i was actually hospitalized at the time and i mean that's all there was and talk about you know you're depressed because you're hospitalized [laughter] and then all you've got to deal with is that um 

538.30 539.13 A: oh 

543.34 544.59 A: yeah 

547.02 548.19 A: oh wow 

547.94 554.54 B: that was something else we actually drove uh were driving to chicago that morning and heard about it just before we got in the car to leave 

554.25 555.40 A: (( oh no )) 

554.79 558.66 B: (( and we're like should we do this or no it was it )) 

556.86 557.81 A: (( yeah )) 

557.87 559.11 A: maybe not 

558.69 561.01 B: was a very weird weird um 

561.31 562.34 A: wow 

561.94 569.38 B: (( an out of body type experience but that was that was some tremendous news coverage i guess i was very thankful for that because )) 

568.69 570.01 A: mhm 

569.94 577.42 B: (( i guess it is different when you know it's happening all the way across the world versus when it's happening in your you know not necessarily your backyard but )) 

577.50 585.01 A: yeah when it was like the first huge thing like that besides pearl harbor basically but that wasn't really terrorists so 

583.09 584.34 B: (( [sigh] i know )) 

584.70 588.53 B: well when you consider it you know even the size of pearl harbor compared to the 

588.92 591.18 B: the size of the twin towers it's it's 

591.15 592.41 A: yeah 

591.79 599.89 B: i i don't know i guess pearl harbor has this mythic quality because we didn't live through it to think that this was worse is just it's mind numbing 

596.16 597.47 A: mhm
