0.31 1.54 B: hi 

1.06 2.39 A: (( hi )) 

1.91 4.43 B: i'm aletha higgs i'm from texas 

4.54 8.22 A: and my name is bridget taylor and i'm from chicago illinois 

10.00 14.35 B: [sigh] okay are we supposed to answer now [laughter] 

11.99 18.46 A: um i guess we're supposed to decide if there's a serious oh i don't know well i'm in the chicago public school system 

18.71 22.56 A: and i don't see anything as a serious problem 

22.48 24.86 B: i don't see anything seriously wrong 

23.20 26.20 A: i don't know if there is anything like that in texas 

25.72 31.28 B: our uh our our our our schools are fine i'm i'm not i don't have any problem with with 

30.66 35.72 A: the only i guess the only one thing issue to me one concern is 

35.82 39.58 A: when the students are if they don't show up for school 

39.91 43.79 A: the parents probably should be contacted that your child is not in school today 

43.94 47.86 A: 'cause the you know the parent could have sent the child to school and maybe they didn't show up 

47.52 49.09 B: right i agree 

48.08 55.86 A: and then something should happen near the end of school when you go to pick 'em up or expect 'em to be at home and you know don't know where they are all that whole day has gone by 

55.65 56.70 B: right 

56.06 62.60 A: when something could have happened so they don't have any kind of plan for that and i think that would be a lot better you know 

59.62 60.59 B: right 

62.51 71.72 A: [cough] 'cause my son goes to school every day but one day he should not be in school then i'd know something must be wrong they shouldn't just assume he's sick and we'll hear from him tomorrow 

71.10 74.91 B: [cough] yeah right instead of letting all that time go by 

74.18 81.80 A: exactly 'cause you know he gets on the school bus sometimes i don't know if there is an attendant there sometimes i can't stay there and wait for him to get on the school bus 

81.96 84.37 A: from there the school bus i don't know what could happen 

84.45 92.95 B: right well they they say um in our schools that they are supposed to call but they don't they don't always do it but um 

91.09 93.40 A: mhm that's right 

93.49 99.55 B: uh the only problem that that i can think of is that i think security needs to be a little bit 

99.49 108.52 B: a little bit better so that we don't have things happening like happened at columbine i just i think that they should have metal detectors in a in a lot of the 

105.22 106.20 A: okay 

109.24 114.27 B: middle schools and uh and high schools especially in in inner city areas 

111.69 112.61 A: mhm 

113.67 115.93 A: right well yeah some of 'em do 

116.07 117.72 B: yeah some of 'em do 

117.12 119.44 A: some do but right not all of them do 

119.47 123.28 A: and i don't yeah i mean they could and i don't know what the kids might feel like 

123.38 125.54 A: feeling like criminals going to school every day 

126.00 130.19 A: and um but it could be like at the airport it could be a 

130.66 135.11 A: um that's a good point 'cause you never know what your fellow [mn] 

135.43 137.80 A: classmate could be bringing to the school 

137.49 138.51 B: right 

137.88 148.05 A: you know they might be mad at somebody and it might be one of the children and not just somebody else coming in the building but that is so true and so many people do come in and out of school for whatever reason 

141.78 143.10 B: that's right 

148.02 156.29 A: you know if they do want to go to the office just the fact that they made it into the school you're right they could have anything and you don't know what what they may do 

156.14 162.85 B: and i know that i've walked into the school many times nobody's said a word to me i could have 

162.86 164.86 B: a gun i could have 

164.27 165.16 A: (( [laughter] )) 

164.90 174.60 B: some you know weapon of some some sort they don't know i mean a a lot of people knew who i was when i when i would go in but um 

165.96 167.07 A: mhm 

168.53 169.79 A: right 

174.51 184.16 B: no you know a lot of times nobody would stop me nobody would ask questions and i would see other uh parents there that you know y- you just never know you just never know 

183.71 195.91 A: right 'cause each school is different and that's true because when i was working the polls some of the polls were in schools and i was doing a vote so i had to go in and deliver the votes to the polling places 

189.95 190.82 B: uh-huh 

195.57 196.59 B: (( mhm )) 

195.96 208.64 A: i know one school there was some little kids before school started waiting on the inside i just walked in there was no adult there whatsoever i walked through hallways looking to find where i'm supposed to deliver the polls 

209.42 216.08 A: and then when i went back the second time and had to go again then it's a child telling me where to go i'm like where are 

216.12 217.82 A: you know the teachers 

216.27 219.32 B: (( [laughter] who's in charge here [laughter] )) 

218.13 229.10 A: there were not even any teachers in the hallway there was and then when they saw me looking you're exactly right they weren't saying anything like can i help you or are you lost or what are you doing here why are you talking to this child 

219.65 220.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

228.99 234.46 A: [laughter] i was like i could have snatched those kids out of school and nobody would even know 

229.76 231.36 B: well it's you know it's 

233.13 239.15 B: nobody would have known who you were or where they'd gone yeah it's it's scary to think that you know i've 

234.53 236.64 A: i was pretty scared 

237.58 242.42 A: [mn] mhm most schools are better than that but that one was pretty bad 

241.77 243.39 B: yeah i agree 

243.51 249.41 A: 'cause i know my son's school their security sits right up they only have door open and that's not even open you have to be buzzed in 

247.13 248.02 B: uh-huh 

249.15 250.10 B: uh-huh 

249.71 254.38 A: so at least you know they have a camera and they know who's coming in and the security sits right there 

254.09 255.62 B: oh well that's good 

255.03 258.66 A: so when you come in he sees who's coming in so they do have that 

258.65 270.61 A: but it like i say each school is different but that particular school is you know i could walk in there wasn't no lock and kids were walking around and i could snatch anybody i wanted to or go anywhere i wanted nobody i could have you know [mn] um 

270.56 274.29 A: hung out in the school when they closed and nobody would have probably known 

274.35 282.36 B: yeah i yeah i guess you just have to hope that that's not gonna happen but ever since um columbine 

274.89 275.92 A: [laughter] 

282.16 291.80 B: and ever since nine eleven you just don't know and now with the you know with the war coming on it it our our our children are the most vulnerable people 

282.32 283.47 A: mhm 

285.30 286.25 A: right 

290.97 292.17 A: right 

291.85 298.64 B: and uh you know i wouldn't put it past terrorists to to go in our schools and that that's what's scary 

296.84 297.88 A: right 

298.41 308.38 A: right and then the other problem is i i don't know how it is there but i know in chicago there's no morning drop off you know parents have to be to work before nine thirty 

299.02 299.84 B: so 

308.32 309.35 B: right 

308.88 316.04 A: and so we really can't bring our kids 'cause my son's school starts at nine fifteen we can't they're not allowed to get there before nine oclock 

316.54 317.92 B: really 

317.27 328.87 A: right and so what are you supposed to do now i don't work right now but if i were to get a job where i had to be there at eight thirty what could i do then i would have to try to depend on somebody else getting him to the bus stop and i really don't want to do that 

328.62 330.08 B: (( yeah that sucks )) 

329.05 342.63 A: so that's when you can start running into a lot of different other problems now it's okay 'cause when he gets dropped off he goes to after school programs around my house but in the morning there's nowhere for him and the schools should have something for before and after 

343.01 346.35 B: i think so too i think that would be good then the [mn] 

344.16 345.43 A: you know 

345.63 355.29 A: and they have a lot of half days they have one one a month at least and maybe two a month what are the parents to do on those days when they get out at two uh noon 

347.47 348.43 B: uh-huh 

355.62 361.04 A: we can't keep taking off of work everybody doesn't have relatives or babysitters 

355.76 356.69 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

357.56 358.74 B: you can't 

360.65 372.60 B: and and and there are a lot of people who don't have babysitters or relatives and and you know so so there needs to be something set up um through maybe government subsidies that would help people 

364.01 365.12 A: right 

371.98 373.33 A: right 

372.62 374.93 B: who who do have that problem 

374.40 384.29 A: exactly and it's like they just threw this plan on us at the beginning of the year last year we it this is something new i mean they had half days but now they have 'em almost every other week 

384.04 384.95 B: oh 

384.58 395.76 A: and [cough] it seems like every time every time you turn around they're out of school for whatever reason so it's like my goodness i gotta keep trying to find somebody to watch him or be here or it cuts into my work day you know it cuts into my day 

395.73 396.72 B: right 

396.15 399.79 A: but i need to be providing for the house or whatever i'm a single parent 

399.86 404.83 A: so it's really the school situation is getting worse as far as that's concerned 

404.37 405.22 B: right 

405.24 406.59 A: and um 

407.01 410.54 A: they don't take it into account that we need uh advance notice 

410.63 411.95 B: mhm 

411.04 414.16 A: [cough] they just give us a schedule this is what's gonna happen 

413.95 415.66 B: oh that's not 

414.31 416.38 A: and it's like oh my gosh 

416.27 419.69 B: that's not good that is not good 

416.45 417.09 A: [laughter] 

417.45 418.64 A: right 

419.60 427.84 A: and then our park districts you know they don't work all the way with the schools when they're out they uh have they stop two weeks before school starts 

427.85 433.77 A: and they won't start until two weeks after school gets out so you have two weeks or a week of what to do with your child 

434.45 444.99 A: and you know so those kind of things are really really hard because they want to keep the kids off the street but during the time that they are out of school they don't have any kind of program for them to keep them off the streets 

444.55 451.54 B: well i i hope that the government can uh you know i i i know that that they're working toward 

451.91 452.78 B: being 

452.92 467.91 B: um with that uh with subsidizing you know uh the the people who are who are having trouble with problems like that so hopefully you know i guess we can just write to our representatives and try to get 'em to do something about it 

454.67 455.79 A: mhm 

467.33 468.50 A: right 

468.53 471.76 A: 'cause maybe you know they can hire people to 

472.37 474.86 A: because they have a morning program to 

475.23 479.59 A: you know watch the kids maybe a half hour or hour before school starts 

479.04 479.89 B: right 

479.68 492.34 A: because um like the private schools and catholic schools they pretty much have that and i know they have that and still how they pay their employees so they need more money put into the public schools i think the teachers need to get paid more 

483.62 484.52 B: right 

492.11 493.62 B: oh definitely 

492.42 502.64 A: that's that's a big problem now that's a serious problem i think if you're gonna be educating our future doctors or future presidents or future everything then that money needs to go onto the people who's gonna be educating them 

502.98 505.64 A: and their your basic education is when they're young 

505.43 506.77 B: i agree 

506.03 512.41 A: teachers need to be paid a lot more money they go to school four years just like a lot of other people and they get minimum pay 

508.06 509.43 B: a lot more 

513.12 524.62 B: and also i think that the that the teachers would be um would be better and maybe better prepared if they if they did get paid more and i think that they that they'd do a better job 

520.17 522.68 A: get paid more exactly 

524.16 525.30 A: right 

524.72 538.25 B: so um but i've i have a lot of friends i used to work in the school district and i have a lot of friends who quit being teachers because they weren't getting paid enough and they can make more um you know working other places and that's sad 

525.60 526.61 A: 'cause in some 

533.35 534.60 A: exactly 

536.83 539.33 A: mhm that's very sad 

539.74 547.70 A: you know right 'cause there's you know you can't say they just go on for the pay check 'cause it's not too [laughter] much [laughter] 

543.95 544.84 B: right 

545.44 551.02 B: uh no [mn] because they you have to really want to be a teacher to to to teach 

548.48 550.71 A: you really have to r- right 

551.07 552.21 B: so um 

552.32 565.41 B: it's a that is a problem but as far as the education that uh my daughter has gotten uh in the in the schools here in texas she's gotten a a fine education for the public schools 

564.83 566.15 A: mhm 

565.39 569.38 B: and um i don't see that that private schools are any better 

569.23 574.82 A: right i believe um if you know you can learn if you apply yourself you will learn 

575.06 586.68 A: and uh my son started out in catholic school he's in public school now you know i wanted to wait 'til i got him in a in a school that of my choice which i did and it's a pretty good school and i like their program 

583.23 584.29 B: right 

586.47 587.52 B: right 

587.09 593.55 A: and um one he had one teacher that was very good she communicated very well and not everybody has those skills 

593.63 595.71 A: but she was one who would call 

595.79 598.39 A: if something was wrong or if something was right 

598.78 599.90 A: she would call to [mn]
