66.09 67.56 A: yeah 

67.43 70.88 B: but anyway and before that my best friend was 

71.11 72.30 B: um 

72.86 75.33 B: well actually it was a guy from high school that 

75.43 82.27 B: and he went over to japan for a couple of years and hung out there and so i really didn't see him or talk to him so 

82.44 83.38 A: (( yeah )) 

82.62 88.59 B: you know i guess if somebody is gonna offer me money [laughter] that would have been a good time 'cause i couldn't have talked to him anyway [laughter] 

88.13 95.62 A: yeah well my best actually my best friend before my present one um i knew him through high school and like 

95.63 101.41 A: whenever i started college and he moved to new orleans um i'm here in louisiana where are you from 

101.29 104.63 B: i'm in utah right now but i'm originally from oregon 

103.28 104.22 A: (( oh oh )) 

104.39 108.26 A: okay well um but anyway he would 

108.32 115.97 A: he he just kinda turned psycho the last few months so uh yeah i would definitely take a million dollars not to talk to him again [laughter] 

115.27 117.63 B: [laughter] right 

117.09 119.98 A: you know one of those that decides he's in love with you 

119.87 120.84 B: (( uh-oh )) 

120.24 121.96 A: so like i 

120.87 122.49 B: one of those best friends 

122.16 127.58 A: (( yeah well yeah it's like what happened to us being friends for like ten years [laughter] )) 

126.93 128.20 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

128.61 131.32 A: so yeah i definitely 

131.72 133.20 A: [mn] would take the million 

133.23 137.34 B: right so are you do you tend to be best friends with people you date 

137.26 138.25 A: no 

137.62 138.67 B: or 

138.37 140.07 A: no i never date my 

140.28 144.94 A: best friends because it's like it'd be too weird 'cause they become like a brother to 

141.40 142.31 B: oh 

145.26 147.42 A: i i'm an only child 

146.86 148.84 B: oh yeah 

147.74 151.25 A: yeah so they kinda become like my foster adopted brother 

151.42 154.11 B: yeah i did notice that with my best friend like 

154.34 156.70 B: before that he he 

156.83 161.72 B: was like he was my brother people asked us all the time oh are you gonna hook up you gonna hook up but 

161.77 163.27 A: and you're like ooh 

161.77 166.09 B: that just seems so weird [laughter] yeah it was just so [laughter] gross [laughter] 

165.87 166.94 A: yeah 

167.07 174.40 A: i i don't know i don't think [mn] whenever you're good friends with anyone if they are truly your best friend you could ever take the money for it i don't know 

174.07 175.14 B: (( right )) 

174.41 178.12 A: unless it's like you said they're in japan and you can't talk to 'em anyway [laughter] 

177.35 178.35 B: right 

179.05 185.37 B: so my question with this whole benefactor thing is why wh- to what advantage would it be 

185.80 190.13 B: for me not to speak to someone that would be worth a million dollars 

190.12 194.80 A: well if it's somebody like a grandparent that doesn't approve of them 

194.47 196.49 B: okay okay 

196.41 198.97 A: 'cause i could totally see my mum going 

198.99 206.33 A: i don't think he's any good and if you stick around him i'm not gonna you know kinda like whenever you're a teenager and you got that boyfriend your parents hate 

202.87 204.20 B: mhm 

205.74 206.94 B: oh right 

206.65 208.30 A: you ever had that [laughter] 

207.82 218.33 B: [laughter] yes i did actually [laughter] only i didn't have that kind of boyfriend until college where everyone was just like when are you guys gonna break up when are you guys gonna break up [laughter] mhm 

209.84 211.79 A: [laughter] yeah 

217.02 219.26 A: [laughter] i know 

219.32 233.82 A: mm but i i did it earlier i did it in high school got it over with and it's like gee what did i ever see in him but that's kinda the only thing i could think of is like with someone who cares a lot about you and they think the other person is just disruptive to your life 

233.22 235.06 B: being a bad influence on you 

234.65 235.94 A: (( yes )) 

235.53 243.85 B: i had a friend her [mn] that was in uh elementary school and all the way up through middle school that my parents really disapproved of [mn] 

244.45 251.01 B: they never offered me like a trinket or money or anything not to hang out with her but they always discouraged it so 

251.06 252.03 A: (( [mn] )) 

253.11 253.91 A: (( mm )) 

253.35 255.97 B: so and i guess they didn't like her because 

256.95 266.10 B: i don't know we just had different backgrounds and stuff like that and she was always worried that my mum was always paranoid that i was gonna get kidnapped or something anyway which is funny 'cause 

266.00 275.44 B: i grew up in a little town in eastern oregon and like population sixteen o five and nothing ever remotely interesting did ever happen [laughter] 

268.52 269.50 A: mhm 

275.47 290.20 A: well my mum worried 'cause i live in new orleans now my mum always worried about me moving to new orleans and how dangerous it is and now the serial killer that we have is in battenrouge which you have to drive through to get home to laseyette and in laseyette 

290.11 291.29 B: right 

290.85 294.61 A: and so my mum's like i never thought i'd feel safer with you in new orleans [laughter] 

294.42 295.42 B: right 

295.33 296.20 A: (( so )) 

296.43 299.64 B: well i heard about that serial killer guy and 

299.16 300.27 A: yeah 

299.65 300.62 B: (( so it's )) 

300.69 303.30 B: i don't know like i always feel bad when 

303.59 314.40 B: people especially particularly women seem to be the targets of attacks anyway but just girls that are in college and young and it just seems really sad it seems sad for everyone but 

312.01 312.83 A: mm 

312.90 316.80 A: (( well a couple of 'em a couple of 'em were older they were in their forties )) 

316.65 318.01 B: oh for real 

317.50 320.41 A: yeah one was like an antique dealer and stuff 

320.28 321.05 B: (( mm )) 

320.96 334.10 A: and um but the girl that just recently got killed they all i mean three of 'em got killed at home you know were taken from their home well two of 'em were killed in their homes and this latest one was taken from her home putting groceries up 

330.21 331.05 B: mm 

335.15 336.07 A: so 

335.20 338.08 B: well didn't they find that they aren't really connected or 

337.44 341.53 A: oh yeah they're all connected d._n._a. connected all of 'em yeah 

338.73 341.49 B: oh they are connected okay 

341.68 344.60 A: d._n._a. connected all of 'em but anyway [laughter] 

344.68 347.89 B: right well i even wanted to go to toulane for a little while 

348.34 349.18 A: oh 

348.87 352.04 B: and so but i didn't end [laughter] up there 

351.95 358.40 A: yeah well i love new orleans 'cause i'm from laseyette which is two and a half hours away and everything closes at six 

358.03 359.82 B: [laughter] 

359.27 363.89 A: so and there's no culture and kinda narrow minded and so 

363.93 366.12 A: (( [laughter] like yah let's go to the big city )) 

365.95 367.26 B: mhm 

366.57 367.88 A: and i love it here 

368.51 369.36 A: (( so )) 

369.97 371.49 A: (( well um )) 

372.09 378.46 B: so this millionaire person is definitely is probably somebody rich that just doesn't want like a relative or 

378.65 380.89 A: yeah i think so 

379.23 380.75 B: something like that 

382.12 383.53 A: or might be 

384.23 389.38 A: a [mn] a man who is secretly in love with you all this time and is jealous of your best friend 

389.22 391.24 B: [laughter] right 

390.71 392.19 A: i don't know [laughter] 

395.49 407.43 B: like i can't even think of i'm an english major in college and so i've been thinking about is there a book where that's actually happened i don't know try and put together a scenario and it's just not working 

405.78 411.52 A: well i guess it's kind of a spin off of what was that movie where they offered a million dollars to have sex 

411.71 415.03 A: with that guy with the millionaire 

411.75 412.88 B: oh 

415.29 418.44 B: yeah yeah i remember it but i can't remember the name 

418.58 420.48 A: yeah i know it had demi moore in it 

420.38 422.04 B: oh yeah 

421.56 427.38 A: yeah but i wonder if it's something like that because like you said a lot of people their best friends are their husbands 

426.76 427.94 B: mhm 

428.14 430.93 A: and so 

431.12 433.25 A: money or the one you love 

434.12 435.15 B: right 

435.56 439.10 B: so really the question becomes do you value 

439.12 441.51 B: money or love 

441.66 442.94 B: the most 

443.63 445.11 B: so anyway 

444.91 447.59 A: i i wonder if it would be different for guys i 

447.64 452.54 A: wonder what their perspect- like do women think more of these things than men um 

452.81 457.45 A: i mean would guys like be willing just to get rid of their best friends 

457.09 460.87 B: i don't know but see from what i've read like women aren't 

460.94 467.58 B: don't tend to in general be that much attached to material things like most people 

468.54 478.95 B: they care well actually women care more about looks than they do about money [laughter] and i'd definitely say that i was that way like i'd marry a poor cute boy and i did [laughter] [laughter] 

472.87 473.85 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

478.01 482.86 A: [laughter] yeah i've dated a lot of 'em [laughter] 

482.37 483.43 B: mhm 

483.48 484.46 A: so 

485.29 488.62 B: i don't know it [mn] it of course you know it means that 

489.13 495.65 B: our wedding wasn't completely superior but it was nice and i liked it it was definitely representative of us 

495.74 497.99 B: but it wasn't completely 

498.21 500.27 B: you know totally out there with 

500.34 502.63 B: bride magazine [laughter] 

501.81 510.96 A: yeah so you think that if like ten years from now if you have money you are gonna have like the big wedding ceremony and the dream wedding and all that 

510.45 513.86 B: no i actually think a wedding is one of those things that just 

513.97 525.75 B: kind of is one moment in your life and it kind of passes and if you have to look back on your wedding for like all of your good memories of yourself and all the good memories of your youth then 

525.27 526.13 A: (( mhm mm )) 

525.89 534.33 B: it's something's wrong like because every day you should be even prouder of your relationship and it should be even more memorable to you and so 

535.22 538.21 A: maybe you should take doctor phil's place [laughter] 

537.59 538.73 B: [laughter] 

538.59 540.65 A: i don't know i've never seen the show so 

541.25 543.64 A: (( [mn] i don't know i guess )) 

543.59 547.34 B: but anyway or like that joe millionaire show [laughter] 

547.02 555.61 A: well what was the outcome i w- i work nights at a hospital so i don't [mn] i don't get to watch late night tv did are they still together or 

551.17 552.04 B: okay 

553.36 554.27 B: well 

555.65 564.59 B: i don't know i know that he picks you know kind of the small town innocent girl or whatever and she decided not to blow him off and so 

564.50 576.85 B: the producers of the show gave them a million dollars and then i didn't watch the very last one but they really didn't have much in common she's really nice and i don't think he's an evil guy or whatever but they just 

575.85 578.39 A: he's kinda dealing with his new found fame 

577.97 588.26 B: mhm so neither of them i don't think they hate each other but they're definitely not compatible for a relationship and really not a friendship because they live on opposite sides of the country 

588.68 589.58 A: yeah 

591.84 599.89 B: so i don't know like that was this is my first reality show so [laughter] this is the first one i ever r- really watched you know i didn't do 

595.71 596.74 A: (( [laughter] ))
