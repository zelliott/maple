149.46 150.80 A: i mean i figured it would be 

150.94 152.02 A: that way when uh 

152.85 153.69 A: the war started 

153.90 155.97 A: i noticed the gas prices and everything were dropping

179.53 180.49 B: i know everybody 

180.99 184.62 B: i._r._a.'s and pensions and everything have been hit and then 

184.72 186.76 B: since the september eleventh issue 

187.10 187.65 A: right 

188.56 192.51 B: osama bin laden certainly hit us in the pocketbook which was one of his goals 

192.64 194.11 B: be doing 

193.73 195.10 A: yes that's what 

195.21 197.84 A: the whole ordeal was about 

197.44 200.03 B: um do you believe that uh 

200.25 202.88 B: he is still around or do you believe that he was 

201.98 203.40 A: yes 

203.64 204.55 B: i i think he is 

203.77 204.51 A: i think he is 

204.66 207.22 B: too i think he's in hiding somewhere 

206.40 208.93 A: i think they've got him hidden somewhere out there 

209.48 211.34 A: i think they may have wounded him but 

211.97 212.89 A: he's not dead 

213.00 217.40 A: and if he was i mean his kids are going step in where he leaves off you know 

217.64 219.31 B: exactly exactly 

219.41 220.01 B: um 

219.74 221.61 A: see you either got to get one or none 

221.98 223.22 B: well i'm sure 

222.61 223.93 A: or all or none 

223.63 226.89 B: exactly i think he was in cahoots with um 

228.82 232.09 B: mister saddam hussein himself here 

232.38 233.04 B: um 

233.65 234.63 B: they're all kind of 

241.41 244.00 B: like i say i'm not for war either but uh 

245.13 247.05 B: i do home they get him 

246.98 248.33 A: yeah 

247.62 250.58 B: but i mean that's a terrible thing to wish for anybody 

250.82 251.14 B: but 

251.83 252.81 B: you know i 

254.06 255.55 A: yeah i can't help but wish for 

254.59 256.09 B: our our freedom is at 

256.19 258.06 B: stake here and i truly believe that 

258.64 259.04 A: yeah 

260.25 261.94 A: (( )) 

264.57 266.98 B: -press by their country for far too long 

267.38 267.96 A: right 

268.60 270.18 B: you know they could be prosperous 

270.38 271.89 B: and have decent lives 

272.02 272.58 B: too but 

273.21 273.90 B: some people 

275.21 275.58 B: choose 

278.75 279.88 A: yeah i'm 

280.17 283.81 B: to do that in order to make themselves look better and feel better which 

283.93 285.29 B: i don't feel is right either 

285.11 296.93 A: the other thing that makes me really really grumpy is the fact that now we have to go in there and they're going to take money from us to fix up over there and feed those people and feel all better and it's like we've got problems like that in the united 

297.03 299.66 A: states why do we got to go fix them they started this you know 

299.82 301.73 B: well i agree with that too because 

301.92 303.90 B: um we have a lot of homework 

304.42 308.49 B: and a lot you know with our economy being the way it is due to the 

308.54 308.83 A: yeah 

309.36 312.38 B: september eleventh and some other contributing issues 

313.28 317.56 B: we've got a lot of people that are in need of work and as a result are 

317.71 318.28 B: homeless 

318.38 320.78 B: or whatever some people choose to be homeless 

321.06 321.74 A: yeah that's true 

321.36 322.43 B: that's your choice that 

322.52 323.41 B: different but 

324.20 324.80 B: um 

325.34 328.34 B: like you say we do have a lot of our own people to take care of 

328.94 329.66 A: right 

330.55 332.82 B: especially i think some of the elderly with 

333.62 334.20 A: health care 

334.01 337.78 B: the health care issues and and let's face it all of our health 

342.11 345.28 A: yeah i can't even afford it it's so expensive you know 

344.90 346.08 B: well exactly 

347.10 349.54 B: you know i i think they realize that it is 

356.22 357.22 B: people in the middle east 

357.39 359.09 B: to regain some of their 

361.63 366.63 B: local economy and get help get them back on their feet i guess i don't have a problem with that either 

367.41 367.90 B: um 

368.22 370.36 B: although i i do feel that the united 

370.47 371.06 B: states has 

371.17 371.89 B: probably 

373.73 376.30 B: been one of the major peacekeepers of the world 

376.46 376.88 A: right 

377.05 377.63 B: and 

377.88 379.81 B: -ported a lot of these countries like 

380.00 381.10 B: with the united 

382.32 384.09 B: nations and now that 

384.42 385.82 B: you know we're in trouble 

386.62 388.93 B: they're not stepping forward to help 

389.66 390.25 B: um 

391.25 392.92 B: which i find hard to accept 

393.04 394.53 B: but i guess that's their choice 

395.77 399.69 B: and we a lot of these countries we have bailed out in crisis situations 

401.01 401.36 A: yeah 

402.37 407.72 A: but if they're raising their children to believe the same beliefs that these people were trying to get rid of what good is it going to do you know 

407.98 408.77 B: exactly 

409.01 409.82 B: exactly 

409.89 413.31 A: he's just raising another batch of saddams 

413.19 416.46 B: um yeah and let's face it they're always going to be out there 

416.62 417.78 B: just if we can slow 

417.88 419.51 B: their major network 

421.06 422.97 B: might be a while before they have a chance 

424.27 428.05 B: i was uh reading an article recently that someone had sent to me 

428.70 431.91 B: on my computer from a military 

432.66 433.23 B: um 

433.92 435.10 B: naval officer 

436.15 436.68 B: florida 

436.94 437.34 A: uh huh 

437.18 439.38 B: and he was going all the way back 

439.51 440.59 B: to the sixties 

441.54 445.41 B: of the the attacks that we've had upon our country and how this is 

445.52 449.88 B: slowly been building and you know america chose to ignore it 

450.67 452.51 B: um you know for instance 

452.68 455.54 B: the iraqis that attacked our embassy 

455.65 457.33 B: back in the seventies i believe 

458.26 460.20 B: in uh iraq as well 

461.09 464.26 B: and then we've had the bombing of the u._s. cole 

464.43 465.34 B: last year 

465.68 467.53 B: our uh military ship 

465.90 466.33 A: right 

467.78 471.18 B: which took out some soldiers and things and um 

473.19 474.15 B: you know we chose 

474.30 477.10 B: we didn't exactly choose to ignore it but 

478.69 479.24 A: we did 

479.32 480.33 B: i we did 

480.57 482.51 B: yes we did nonetheless ignore it 

482.71 483.13 B: so 

482.89 483.58 A: right 

484.18 486.69 B: can i ask how you got connected with the fisher 

486.89 487.29 B: study 

488.05 490.18 A: um i'm signed with the um 

490.58 491.77 A: money and shopping secret 

491.97 492.40 B: oh 

491.98 492.24 A: (( )) 

492.56 493.18 B: me too 

493.69 499.64 B: okay well they told me that i would be talking with someone who was also part of 

493.70 494.21 A: oh are you 

499.77 500.22 B: study

510.07 512.46 B: wasn't aware how the connection was going but 

512.67 518.69 B: and i'm not sure exactly what they're trying to get out of this other than we speak english and that we do talk about current events so 

518.95 520.66 A: correct i think that's it
