130.67 131.22 B: mhm 

131.30 132.25 A: and

152.64 153.25 B: you know 

158.06 165.15 A: publicized which is what we are talking about the fact that you can see it on t._v. in the papers and on the internet

202.70 204.04 A: exactly 

207.81 210.70 B: when it is actually going to come to ahead and finish 

210.81 211.63 A: exactly 

211.76 222.71 B: you know they should have done him away with a long time ago but that is my point that is my opinion you know and so i'm like okay now why didn't they do this yet 

214.33 215.35 A: exactly 

220.27 221.30 A: i would agree with that 

222.36 223.37 A: yeah exactly 

223.47 227.43 B: so i i mean it's it's i'm very thankful we have a good news 

227.58 230.29 B: station here and they have sent also 

230.82 235.39 B: some people over there so we are getting a lot of up to date information from it 

235.95 236.47 B: so i 

236.05 241.79 A: yeah that is interesting i just think about my own stations you guys have obviously c._n._n. and all those those are all 

241.92 242.49 B: uh-huh 

242.44 243.81 A: national t._v. 

244.03 244.79 A: stations right

249.82 250.35 A: okay 

250.40 254.10 B: and they are giving us all the like an hourly update 

254.45 254.93 A: wow 

255.03 256.75 B: and it is kind of uh 

257.27 261.11 B: i guess not reassuring but it is nice to know that 

261.24 265.16 B: somebody is there to tell us maybe what is going on that we don't know 

265.38 267.97 A: yeah this has never been able to be done before 

267.91 268.74 B: no 

268.11 269.16 A: like this you know 

269.31 269.95 B: no 

269.98 270.98 A: i think you wouldn't 

271.65 274.31 A: see pictures from the war -til months after you know 

282.10 286.08 B: and it's it's it's interesting to find out now 

286.61 290.11 B: you know actually what they go over there and do so i kind of like 

287.42 287.96 A: exactly 

290.31 291.69 B: to know what is going on 

291.85 292.19 A: yes 

292.46 295.66 B: not that i'm i'm really in to it you know it's just 

292.48 293.09 A: that's right 

295.87 296.79 A: it's interesting 

296.74 297.35 B: it is 

297.47 297.76 A: yes 

298.05 299.13 B: you know and it is just 

299.29 302.24 B: too darn many people that's having to go over there and 

302.52 305.57 B: you know actually they signed up for this you know 

305.33 305.73 A: yeah 

305.89 306.42 B: but 

306.00 306.40 A: yeah 

307.10 310.26 B: you know you have to feel like well how did they feel beginning the war 
310.40 310.78 A: yeah 

311.33 316.93 B: you know do they actually want to go over there and um i know that some of them may have um 

317.69 319.39 B: oh what is the word that i'm looking for 

319.64 324.64 B: you know animosity where they want to go over there and just bombard em okay 

324.33 324.82 A: right 

324.83 327.37 B: but they have to follow the prototype you know 

324.99 325.42 A: right 

327.37 327.74 A: right 

327.97 329.31 B: so it is kind of neat though 

329.80 331.55 B: i mean i can i think it's cool 

331.72 335.64 B: i mean that we know what is going on i don't think it is cool that we are in the war 

331.91 332.25 A: (( )) 

335.62 336.36 A: exactly 

336.42 340.07 B: but it is cool that we are able to read in the newspaper 

340.18 344.34 B: m- and uh like you said the internet and everything 

343.50 343.82 A: yeah 

345.04 345.98 B: so i like it 

345.09 345.84 A: exactly 

346.60 347.22 B: that we can 

346.77 347.24 A: it 

347.36 347.86 B: keep up 

348.38 350.06 A: and you heard about the um 

350.85 352.90 A: man that threw the 

353.00 353.86 B: yes 

354.15 356.03 A: grenades i believe it was 

356.13 356.92 A: into the 

356.19 358.35 B: yes i- isn't that horrible 

357.22 357.96 A: tents of his 

358.14 359.25 A: yeah his comrades 

360.05 364.11 B: i know and they i mean i i did he share the same tent with them 

363.67 364.13 A: yeah 

364.34 365.14 A: exactly 

365.29 366.37 B: that is horrible 

366.74 370.78 A: but what you just said you know they just want to go over there you know like 

371.26 377.60 A: you have to wonder i automatically assume that every single person over there is for war because they are over there 

377.30 377.85 B: right 

377.74 379.34 A: you know they've got their own issues 

379.53 380.10 A: too 

380.36 380.91 B: right 

380.96 384.56 A: like my father was just saying the other day if you have some one who 

385.43 385.84 A: is 

385.98 387.70 A: even on the brink 

388.02 390.09 A: say of some mental illness 

390.01 390.69 B: yeah 

390.70 392.27 A: you send them into war 

392.55 393.17 B: yeah 

394.10 396.37 A: and it is going to easily put -em over the edge 

394.12 394.81 B: (( )) 

396.42 397.44 B: i would definitely 

398.18 400.89 B: i mean my father was in world war two and 

401.00 401.85 B: uh he's 

402.06 405.08 B: deceased now but he was a total basket case 

405.29 406.08 A: exactly 

406.39 406.93 A: exactly 

406.88 408.38 B: i mean vietnam uh pardon me 

407.72 410.82 A: you look at ve- exactly that what i was going to say vietnam 

410.81 414.66 B: yeah and he came home and he was really messed up from the war 

414.42 416.51 A: oh yeah we know several people that are yeah 

416.78 417.22 B: and 

416.85 417.32 A: totally 

417.39 418.74 B: uh once these people 

418.98 420.11 B: going to come back at 

419.84 421.40 A: yeah uh uh that is what you wonder 

421.69 429.75 B: yeah i mean i i i'd hope no ill will to -em you know i just don't want to i know it is going to happen 

422.47 422.87 A: exactly 

425.88 426.23 A: yeah 

430.67 434.76 B: you know that is just i guess the casualties one of the casualties of war 

435.39 436.19 B: you know but 

436.82 437.27 A: right 

436.83 441.82 B: i think they just need to get over there and get him gone and then maybe it will be a better country for them 

442.03 444.95 A: it looks like they are about to be in baghdad 

445.06 445.66 A: so 

445.52 446.25 B: oh cool 

446.52 448.87 B: and that is where the main thing is right 

448.42 449.86 A: exactly that is where 

449.05 449.61 B: yeah 

450.03 451.03 A: saddam is 

450.73 451.86 B: oh 

451.38 451.84 A: so 

451.95 454.46 A: they think anyway you never know with him he 

453.55 455.74 B: well he is probably underground somewhere 

455.04 455.97 A: exactly 

456.48 458.07 A: he could be anywhere 

456.56 457.06 B: yeah 

458.02 463.61 B: i think it's me i mean i i just like being able to pick up the newspaper if i want to read i can read it 

464.62 468.27 A: yeah we actually don't receive the newspaper here ever since 

464.68 465.09 B: i don't 

468.63 472.46 A: we got married and got our own place we haven't got the newspaper but i 

472.14 472.65 B: mhm 

472.72 475.52 A: i and i used to get it at my work but i just recently s- 

475.62 477.36 A: stopped and now i don't get it there 

477.51 478.22 B: right 

477.95 479.49 A: so i have actually missed that a lot 

480.51 480.99 A: so 

485.16 490.62 B: like we get -em on the internet so if you provide you know subscribe to -em you can go and read about it 

490.82 494.40 A: yeah you know ours is on the internet and i never even think about that 

494.91 495.18 A: i 

500.00 501.12 A: exactly 

500.83 503.09 B: you know i would 

502.12 503.18 A: that is very true 

503.97 504.51 B: uh-oh 

504.62 504.90 A: oh 

505.12 507.47 B: is that hanging up i wonder 

507.96 509.67 A: i just heard a beep but that was 

513.42 515.40 A: same here 

514.22 519.58 B: oh okay cool but uh i don't know if it just goes dead or what 

519.84 523.03 A: i would think it that it would say something like it did before 

523.22 525.95 B: because yeah aren't we supposed to like talk ten minutes or so
