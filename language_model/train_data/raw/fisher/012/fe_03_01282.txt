95.95 97.49 A: get antsy i guess you might say 

96.61 101.53 B: well i tell you what my cousin is is a is a marine in the very first division over there 

102.09 109.19 B: so he was one of the very first marines to go in in the tanks so it's hard not to watch it but it's hard to watch it 

105.32 105.69 A: uh huh 

108.96 110.76 A: you know what's really unbelievable is 

110.93 111.33 A: all the 

111.62 112.11 A: i mean 

112.58 114.50 A: that we're seeing all this on t._v. 

114.73 115.39 A: i mean my 

115.18 116.06 B: i know 

116.13 118.33 A: my dad you know he was in the war his 

118.57 119.89 A: brother was in the war

122.00 122.46 A: you know 

122.58 124.87 A: i forget what war it was that he was in but 

125.23 125.92 A: to think 

126.11 127.30 A: that they would actually 

127.63 127.96 A: um 

128.91 129.25 A: um 

129.98 131.15 A: were broadcast this 

131.25 134.48 B: like a i was like live twenty four hours kind of thing 

131.47 132.41 A: on t._v. 

134.15 135.54 A: yeah i mean it's just 

135.65 137.65 A: it's unbelievable cause they've never done this be- 

137.45 141.24 B: yeah i know i think for history purposes that's really great 

137.75 138.33 A: -for like this 

138.73 139.02 A: and 

141.09 141.94 A: it yeah it is 

141.62 142.15 B: you know 

142.50 143.69 A: but for families 

143.53 145.64 B: right it's really hard 

143.85 144.33 A: that have 

144.66 146.49 A: families over there i i 

146.68 147.86 A: don't know how they do it 

147.95 148.44 B: yeah 

148.05 149.22 A: i mean with all the cover- 

149.83 151.09 B: i know because you know 

151.48 155.52 B: like normally i've got one little girl and she's she's only nine months old 

164.60 166.09 B: dated you know with the news 

166.14 166.70 A: mhm 

166.47 174.38 B: and it's like you know what are we going to do you know but then again i want to watch that you know so it's hard for me to kind of 

169.25 169.75 A: exactly 

175.08 182.01 B: to say okay we need to do something for her because i don't want her watching that all the time i mean i know she's not old enough to really pick up on it but 

181.91 184.46 A: yeah she's not old enough to understand really what's going on 

183.67 184.18 B: yeah 

185.04 187.45 B: yeah but she still needs that other stuff you know 

187.00 187.72 A: oh yeah 

188.10 188.68 B: that um 

189.26 194.72 B: yeah i did not know that though about the um executions i know that they were blasted for showing 

194.86 196.76 B: something about the p._o._w.'s but 

196.95 200.15 B: like i was out of the house today so i didn't really catch a lot of it 

201.07 201.65 B: but um 

202.14 205.34 B: good gracious did they they didn't say like who they were or anything 

211.18 211.83 B: i know 

211.81 214.02 A: it's hard to remember what you saw one day 

212.70 215.13 B: it's hard to keep up with it and when it happened 

214.88 215.30 A: yeah 

215.33 217.86 B: cause it's it's because it's that (( )) coverage i think 

218.04 218.37 A: yeah 

218.31 220.49 B: you know it all goes together now but 

221.18 222.12 A: and then they've got 

223.36 223.86 A: days 

224.24 224.54 A: got 

225.92 226.91 A: two more because 

230.62 231.39 B: oh yeah 

232.51 235.71 B: was that the british the two that died today were british soldiers 

236.02 236.88 A: well i don't i'm not 

237.76 239.20 A: was there two that died today 

239.63 240.46 A: i know that there was 

239.73 242.16 B: um well no i saw it on there today i don't know 

242.68 245.05 B: i don't think it happened today the two british soldiers 

244.21 244.46 A: (( )) 

245.85 248.63 B: cause they were missing and they just assumed that they were 

248.98 249.82 B: they had died 

251.18 254.61 B: um and that went down because of the patriot missile that's what i saw 

255.29 258.38 B: so that was what was really sad about that cause that was like 

258.88 259.65 B: good gracious 

260.08 260.58 A: yeah 

260.23 262.70 B: that that kind of stuff i mean i know that kind of thing 

263.06 264.74 B: it it happens you know but good 

264.86 265.79 B: grief 

267.16 269.95 B: are you um are you for the war or against the war 

270.80 271.13 A: mi- 

271.33 271.85 A: i guess 

272.00 272.45 B: yeah 

272.80 273.35 A: i mean 

272.88 275.54 B: it's hard to ever say you're for the war you know but 

273.60 273.88 A: (( )) 

275.06 275.68 A: yeah because 

275.79 278.68 A: you know that there's just going be so many lives that are going to be lost 

278.61 279.12 B: yeah 

278.89 280.41 A: and that's what the sad part is 

280.22 280.84 B: i know 

281.37 281.63 A: but 

281.40 282.80 B: and scary yeah 

281.79 283.09 A: i mean we do have to (( )) 

283.34 283.62 A: (( )) 

284.12 284.83 A: terrorism 

284.59 285.70 B: i agree with that 

285.45 286.87 A: i mean we really do 

293.89 294.27 A: yeah 

294.08 297.89 B: because they are much stronger now than they were twelve years ago 

298.10 298.99 B: and they're they're 

299.13 299.56 B: um 

300.25 304.79 B: you know excuse the word but he seems to be even more of an evil tyrant to me 

304.55 304.97 A: yeah 

305.26 305.75 B: you know 

305.46 306.21 A: i would i 

307.10 309.03 A: i just cannot imagine living 

311.32 312.49 B: i know i mean it's 

311.65 312.57 A: and if you talk 

312.68 312.98 A: back 

313.33 313.79 A: them 

314.66 315.60 A: i mean 

316.89 317.76 A: they're going to kill you 

317.77 318.72 B: yeah it's it's 

318.33 319.44 A: i mean you know 

318.88 320.65 B: it's really hard to imagine 

320.14 320.77 A: voice your own 

321.18 322.22 A: opinion about him 

322.66 323.13 B: yeah 

323.54 332.22 B: and that's why a lot of these people um like as soon as the war started the soldiers just turned themselves over they weren't even they didn't even want to be fighting a lot of them 

332.66 335.83 B: you know they're just pushed into that you know and um 

335.94 347.05 B: i thought it was really uh good to see that some of these towns (( )) they would come to the people would welcomed our soldiers you know cause it's just as mixed an opinion probably over there as it is over here 

347.31 347.80 B: you know 

348.17 349.09 A: i know i was list- 

352.53 352.83 A: there was 

355.93 356.34 B: mhm 

356.88 357.84 A: shot and there was this 

357.96 358.38 A: one 

359.29 360.14 A: that was shot 

361.18 361.95 A: and um 

363.14 367.08 A: i don't know who the news reporter was i think i had it on m._s._n._b._c. and 

367.60 368.91 A: they went over to him and 

372.28 373.10 A: they let him 

375.27 375.96 A: their phone 

376.77 377.11 A: call his 

379.20 380.32 A: let her know that he 

385.99 386.60 B: uh huh 

386.43 388.95 A: i'm sure his mother was just going ballistic 

388.85 395.90 B: i know that's i think that's why they were so blasted you know by the american government because what is it they said that was a um 

396.65 398.59 B: it was like a breech of the geneva 

399.29 399.73 A: oh no- 

399.91 400.41 A: well this 

400.61 402.31 A: this was a u._s. soldier and 

402.72 403.16 A: it was 

403.34 403.90 A: you know 

405.08 405.79 A: being broadcast 

405.94 406.60 A: by m._s._n. 

407.13 408.55 A: they let him use their phone 

408.47 410.00 B: oh okay okay 

409.38 410.47 A: to call his mother 

410.59 411.58 B: oh my gosh 

411.20 414.58 A: but yeah the ones that you're talking about the geneva convention and all yeah 

413.96 414.42 B: yeah 

415.00 417.16 A: um that's the ones i'm talking about where they've got a 

417.60 420.78 A: them as prisoners of war and some of them were ex- 

419.37 420.07 B: right 

420.99 421.93 A: i mean not the ones 

422.87 423.35 A: well i 

423.77 427.57 A: it's the ones that went in that town and realized they took a wrong turn 

427.85 428.22 A: and they 

427.98 428.68 B: oh 

428.51 429.02 A: started to 

429.16 429.93 A: double back 

430.45 431.86 A: and that's when they ran in 

432.93 433.42 B: mhm 

440.59 441.39 B: you know and that 

440.79 442.51 A: (( )) it was like eleven or twelve of them 

448.57 449.07 B: yeah 

451.69 452.77 B: well you know and that 

452.91 461.55 B: there there video videoing or whatever their um executions that's just that just goes to show you how horrible 

458.95 459.64 A: yeah that's what 

461.86 467.45 B: they are that's their fear tact- that's how they do their own people though they scare their own people with things like that 

461.91 462.56 A: yeah 

462.69 463.13 A: yeah 

463.52 463.85 A: (( )) 

465.47 465.96 A: yeah 

467.22 467.54 A: yeah 

469.73 470.13 B: is 

470.26 474.79 B: gives me chills because if you can just even imagine being a woman over there 

482.14 487.09 B: but to be a woman over there i would think that if i was a woman and i had a daughter i would just cry 

487.18 487.69 B: you know 

487.81 488.21 A: uh huh 

488.27 491.42 B: to know that i had to bring a daughter up in a society like that 

492.37 494.43 B: i think we take that for granted over here 

494.30 495.01 A: yeah we do 

494.92 503.93 B: people forget that you know whether you agree or you disagree with the war the soldiers that are fighting are fighting for you to have the right to disagree you know 

503.54 503.99 A: exact 

504.17 504.88 A: and you know what 

505.23 505.52 A: is 

505.67 507.38 A: sort of ironic is all the 

507.52 509.02 A: demonstrators that are against 

509.60 510.09 B: yeah 

510.90 511.44 A: they don't 

512.05 513.53 A: they turn around they end up start- 

514.45 514.81 A: fight 

514.86 516.00 B: yeah i know 

515.29 515.62 A: and 

515.72 520.32 A: it's like i don't understand this here you're against a war but you're standing there and you're fighting 

520.37 521.58 B: yeah i know 

520.75 521.16 A: that's the 

521.34 522.63 A: i mean and since the war 

522.81 523.50 A: same thing that 

523.85 526.16 B: is kind of hypocrisy isn't it 

523.95 525.16 A: what our men are doing 

526.26 528.39 A: ours is doing it for a reason 

528.43 528.92 B: yeah 

528.66 529.48 A: and that is 

530.38 530.71 A: (( ))
