22.30 27.33 A: so uh the now the topic is u._s. public schools what can be done about it 

27.06 27.78 B: mhm 

27.55 28.41 A: um 

28.74 34.92 A: well and wouldn't you know i don't have any children so i'm not actually involved in the public schools 

34.64 35.46 B: mhm 

35.22 36.73 A: but my 

36.86 41.10 A: feeling is that uh things begin at home 

48.98 50.25 A: for their own actions 

50.48 51.13 B: mhm 

50.79 54.68 A: that we wouldn't have as many problems as we're having with today's young people 

55.16 55.65 B: mhm 

56.15 57.64 A: and what do you feel 

58.05 58.66 B: um 

59.21 63.12 B: uh i do agree with that that uh you know the socializing starts 

63.35 64.14 B: in the home 

64.36 65.04 B: um 

64.46 64.75 A: mhm 

65.77 66.75 B: i 

66.87 68.85 B: i'm actually in college right now so i've 

69.25 71.63 B: i went to public school a few years ago and 

71.17 71.68 A: uh huh 

71.92 72.45 B: um 

73.09 73.94 B: i feel that 

74.34 75.64 B: uniforms are not 

76.38 76.92 B: um 

77.93 81.01 B: a good policy to try and you know prevent 

81.40 84.70 B: violence and and things in the public school and i feel that um 

85.87 86.47 B: um 

88.18 88.92 B: i guess 

89.67 93.05 B: i'm not i'm not totally aware of of how severe 

93.66 97.19 B: these you know problems in public schools are as in my 

97.30 100.50 B: um upbringing you know my my school was fairly 

101.31 101.81 B: um 

103.02 105.05 A: calm yeah well 

103.43 105.77 B: yeah yeah and so 

105.97 116.17 A: that's how it was when i went to school um my school and it was the school that i went to was supposed to be the the tough school 

116.26 116.80 B: mhm 

116.33 120.52 A: in uh my city compared to the other 

121.04 121.43 A: schools 

122.11 122.50 A: but 

127.51 128.10 B: hm 

128.23 128.68 B: mhm 

132.35 134.74 A: you know rhetoric that we were hearing 

134.39 135.19 B: right 

134.89 139.76 A: and you know during and after the fact but um 

140.21 141.35 A: it 

150.01 156.97 A: i was my father was a teacher and my stepmom is also um they're both retired now but 

152.24 153.03 B: mhm 

156.76 157.28 B: mhm 

163.71 165.17 A: everybody else that was 

164.78 165.56 B: right 

165.35 169.71 A: you know everything that i knew but i just looked at them as being respect 

169.82 172.84 A: -ble to them because they were adults 

172.90 173.62 B: right 

173.71 174.31 A: um 

174.70 181.62 B: i yeah i actually have a similar experience as well my actually i went to the public school and then there was an alternative high school 

174.93 175.43 A: and 

181.75 182.28 A: uh huh 

182.36 186.95 B: in in town which my mother was a teacher at the alternative high school 

186.79 187.78 A: oh okay 

187.58 190.52 B: so that was a high school um where you know 

190.79 193.67 B: kids couldn't be in the main stream school for either 

194.07 197.87 B: you know behavioral problems or something like that so i i i mean 

198.01 200.43 B: that's the only types of things that i heard about 

200.62 204.37 B: real big problems in school was violence and and stuff but 

202.68 203.06 A: uh huh 

204.10 204.83 A: right 

204.57 206.45 B: in the mainstream school 

206.49 207.03 A: um 

207.03 211.35 B: i'm not even sure what you know the the big problems are if it's gangs or violence 

211.49 211.96 B: drugs 

211.95 213.78 A: well i think that 

212.29 212.72 B: you know 

213.89 225.36 A: one thing that that both my father and my stepmom said were that about the time they retired was when they were really having a problem with an influx of drug babies 

225.77 234.48 A: you know products of their mothers doing crack and everything else and so many of them had um you know 

226.53 227.49 B: mmm 

228.47 229.37 B: right 

234.73 241.27 A: attention deficit disorder and and similar experiences that they were they were really 

238.68 239.86 B: oh they're yeah 

241.46 246.20 A: more difficult and one problem that they had had is that they 

246.30 250.74 A: were trying to mainstream a lot of individuals that 

251.36 260.92 A: with a a lower i._q. and when i say that i don't mean that they're stupid i mean that that there was a mental a learning disorder type of thing 

260.59 261.31 B: mhm 

261.04 261.67 A: and 

262.81 266.20 A: it was kind of two schools of thought it's great to 

266.45 273.66 A: teach them to be productive members of society and to how to get along with people but at the other part was that it made 

273.97 276.15 A: it slowed things down for everyone else 

276.16 276.74 B: mhm 

276.28 280.56 A: and it made it more difficult for other for them to go on with other programs 

280.46 281.10 B: right 

280.74 284.62 A: because they were mainstreamed in with it so it was 

284.78 286.40 A: it's it's 

294.19 306.00 A: race color creed or you know or their learning abilities or things like or their you know disabilities kind of thing but on the other hand is it fair to the people the children that have 

295.93 297.28 B: right yeah 

299.02 299.57 B: mhm 

306.35 307.49 A: um a gift 

307.77 308.30 B: mhm 

307.85 313.27 A: to hold them back where they're not able to express their gift or or use their 

313.47 316.95 A: their gift as much it's it's not going to be an easy 

314.37 315.11 B: right 

319.09 319.72 B: yeah 

327.93 334.91 A: you know really had a lot of of violence i've usually either lived in rural areas or um 

329.86 330.39 B: mhm 

335.23 342.49 A: smaller cities things that they didn't but i have lived in a couple of places i lived in um portland for a while 

336.69 337.38 B: mhm 

343.15 350.80 A: um portland oregon and north portland is definitely known for you know a lot of gang violence and that kind of thing and 

344.39 344.93 B: mhm 

352.57 353.23 B: yeah 

358.13 364.78 A: uh reno doesn't have quite as much problem but you know unfortunately it touches everywhere because drugs touch 

361.78 362.39 B: mhm 

365.04 370.29 B: every- right yeah another thing i'm i'm thinking of um is uh 

365.10 365.99 A: everywhere 

370.79 371.43 B: as far as 

372.45 375.35 B: in in in um urban areas when 

376.07 381.57 B: it's it's unfair that the public school systems are usually o- generally for those 

381.75 384.21 B: who who really can't afford to send their 

384.53 385.94 B: children to private schools 

385.33 386.24 A: right 

386.48 386.99 A: right 

386.51 387.60 B: and um 

388.16 389.40 B: even if you know 

389.55 392.85 B: uh children from a lower in- a child from a lower income family 

393.72 394.13 B: it has 

394.33 398.10 B: has has a high i._q. you know if they go to this 

398.22 401.80 B: a a poor school system just because they can't afford it 

401.32 412.40 A: they're not going to get the same opportunities i i know exactly what you're saying we were as a matter of fact uh my um parents and i were discussing um the area 

403.05 403.82 B: right 

412.81 423.76 A: uh we were in a a real small town and they were noticing how large the school was and i said well i'm sure they a lot of kids are brought in from outlying areas and they were talking about 

421.82 422.36 B: mhm 

423.91 432.63 A: um some place that they had been where they're bussing the kids in like thirty or forty miles everyday and i thought good heavens 

432.25 433.46 B: wow yeah 

433.00 436.79 A: that would just be that would be terrible um 

435.50 436.15 B: mhm 

443.32 449.45 A: uh they're in such outlying areas but they were also saying that there are some schools where the children only come home 

449.70 451.07 A: on the weekends because it 

450.52 451.72 B: oh my gosh 

458.26 459.11 B: yeah 

459.67 460.50 A: stay there 

460.58 463.12 A: just that amount of time because the schools 

463.61 469.27 A: and their homes are and there's such a distance and i thought yeah that's what i said 

465.99 466.70 B: wow 

468.98 469.63 B: mhm 

469.59 471.51 A: so uh um but 

471.89 474.69 A: i i don't think that there is a simple answer 

474.78 477.18 B: i yeah i really don't either um 

484.15 486.18 A: are the answer um 

486.62 494.68 A: and it seems to me if they want to go with a kind of uniform thing why can't they just make it something simple like levis and a 

494.86 500.32 A: you know and a shirt or you know something that is that is appealing to everyone 

496.07 496.75 B: mhm 

499.94 501.63 B: appealing to kids right 

501.40 511.42 A: right exactly i mean it doesn't have to be you know the the social kind of thing but i mean i remember being in school man and you had to have that certain kind of jeans 

501.73 503.72 B: rather than the suits and 

507.00 507.45 B: mhm 

511.07 513.76 B: oh yeah yeah i definitely still think that's 

511.75 519.46 A: it'd be cool you know the kinds that really made your rear end look good 

514.91 520.17 B: yeah yeah definitely 

519.67 522.55 A: absolutely and and you know and
