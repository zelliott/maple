28.33 30.82 A: so we're supposed to talk about public schools 

30.70 33.53 B: oh my goodness well i can talk about that 

33.16 35.11 A: so can i 

58.47 64.79 B: so sometimes when you go down to the agencies that give you this assistance and this help they keep you there 

64.90 73.91 B: to the wee hours and you get you miss your kids you you know there's there's not a sufficient enough time for you to pick up your kids from the school 

74.95 81.91 B: so i think that's what the major problem is with these new york city schools is that they don't have a sufficient after-school program 

82.05 83.38 A: so you live in new york city 

83.36 84.27 B: yes 

83.52 86.51 A: well i live in a small town 

86.98 90.74 A: on on the edges of the state capital of west virginia 

91.02 92.44 B: okay 

91.69 94.96 A: so it's but it's a nice small blue collar town 

95.33 96.51 B: right 

96.44 97.04 A: and 

97.43 99.21 A: actually i have a son who who 

99.56 100.25 A: you know 

100.48 103.30 A: is disabled and we do the state agencies but they're 

103.70 106.43 A: not quite probably as crowded and terrible as as 

106.96 110.61 A: as new york but our schools have a lot of problems too 

107.80 108.78 B: yes they are 

110.40 111.39 B: right 

110.84 112.65 A: and i certainly agree that 

112.90 116.91 A: with so many parents working and i raise my kids as a working parent 

117.07 117.71 B: right 

117.69 120.05 A: that we really do need after-school programs 

120.02 122.01 B: we do need after-school programs 

121.61 122.18 A: in fact 

122.55 123.73 A: the 

124.14 125.34 A: the town charleston 

126.60 129.26 A: one of my young high school friends 

129.94 130.43 A: uh 

130.71 133.78 A: they wanted to enforce a curfew an after dark curfew 

133.88 134.51 B: right 

134.53 146.35 A: and my young high school friend and her and her friends researched it and found that most teenagers get in trouble with the law between the time school closes and about seven p._m. when their parents get home 

154.86 160.89 B: the appointment or your job early enoug- you know sufficient enough time for you to um 

158.81 159.35 A: yeah 

161.35 164.33 B: pick up your children so then you know it's 

164.91 167.14 B: oh my goodness everybody is 

166.41 170.54 A: so so do you think after-school programs should be paid for out of 

170.91 173.62 A: education dollars or 

176.36 181.53 B: to concentrate on the funds for our children 

182.42 189.92 B: that's what i i believe i believe they should take those funds and and put them the funds where they belong that's for our kids 

190.09 195.46 A: yeah but do you think they should come out of the school system or community grants or 

194.55 196.88 B: i think it should come out of the school system 

197.72 201.69 B: the school the the they they need to give the school systems more money 

201.67 202.12 A: uh huh 

202.15 209.44 B: that's why we have so many kids nowadays that that we're losing them at the wayside 

211.21 212.07 A: yeah what 

211.53 212.72 B: because a lot of them 

212.48 214.54 A: what about the role of volunteers 

214.90 218.09 B: oh my goodness um let me be the first to sign up 

219.50 221.50 B: let me be the first to sign up 

221.01 221.48 A: yeah 

221.70 222.80 B: as a volunteer 

223.98 228.24 A: yeah well i'm retired now and i probably should be doing after-school tutoring and 

228.37 229.16 A: and working with 

229.82 231.54 A: i like junior high school kids so 

233.41 234.66 A: and i'm not doing it though 

235.07 235.85 A: quite honestly 

235.39 241.37 B: no but you know they need what they need to do is these people out here that want jobs 

242.04 248.38 B: and if if if if something available like that for them i don't think they would turn anything down like that 

248.90 252.06 B: but people looking for jobs and they just not funding 

252.65 254.40 B: you know our kids properly 

255.01 256.23 B: that's just my opinion 

257.08 257.45 A: yeah well 

257.73 259.83 A: well we do have an after-school program 

260.41 261.83 A: in several of the schools 

263.45 266.35 A: it's called third base because that's where you go before you go home 

266.63 267.20 B: right 

267.16 268.18 A: and 

269.15 271.18 A: they do a combination of um 

272.85 274.12 A: tutoring and 

276.04 277.08 A: group games 

277.35 277.98 B: right 

277.91 279.86 A: i mean they're usually held like in the gym 

280.45 281.09 B: yeah 

282.91 284.28 A: you know and things like that 

284.73 289.21 B: my kids go to an after-school program but it's not in their school 

289.90 291.31 B: it's in another school 

292.43 298.74 B: so i basically have to be there to pick them up to take them to the other after-school program and then go back 

299.14 300.20 B: and finish doing what 

300.56 303.56 B: you know whatever i was doing taking care of my business 

304.06 305.71 A: yeah if you were working is 

305.85 307.71 A: would there be transportation to get them 

307.87 310.77 B: to the af- to the other after-school program no 

310.31 310.73 A: yeah 

310.94 311.50 B: no 

311.76 314.03 A: well that's rid- you know that kind of defeats it 

312.72 313.37 B: yeah 

314.19 315.24 B: i exactly 

315.43 316.09 B: i know 

317.85 320.01 B: i've been working very hard so 

320.61 323.97 B: and so the best thing that i do is i just keep positive and 

324.86 331.15 B: i know there's going to be a better way i'm even looking into um doing schooling at home 

331.49 332.21 B: where i could teach 

332.38 334.05 B: my own kids from my home 

334.47 334.98 A: mhm 

335.25 335.96 B: you know 

336.09 338.74 B: so that's a that's a option that i'm 

339.17 340.92 B: going to be researching soon 

342.44 343.54 A: yeah i'm not sure what 

343.75 345.19 A: your state laws are 

346.52 348.92 A: i think ours is you have to have a education 

349.28 350.91 A: equal to or greater to 

351.66 353.78 A: you know the year in which you're teaching your kid 

355.54 356.47 B: yeah 

355.83 356.35 A: and 

356.91 361.54 A: you know and and we're we're getting you know we're getting a tremendous amount of people that are winning 

362.23 367.01 A: you know spend spelling bees and doing very well academically coming out of home schooling 

367.96 368.68 B: right 

369.68 371.88 B: i i think so because um 

372.93 374.18 B: even you know my 

374.29 374.82 B: my 

374.99 376.36 B: daughter's teacher 

376.79 386.43 B: she she strongly suggested that being that my daughter is in the first grade but she's reading on second grade going into third grade level she recommended that i um 

381.23 381.69 A: mhm 

387.29 398.14 B: um take my daughter out of that school and and put her into gifted school which i had her apply i had her you know they pick through they take a test but she didn't make the gifted school 

398.36 398.84 A: mhm 

398.38 402.28 B: i don't know why but now me and her teacher is going to work very hard 

403.20 405.54 B: to place her somewhere where she can 

405.72 407.14 B: excel even more 

408.06 408.90 A: that's wonderful 

408.82 413.40 B: not pushing her of course going according to what she can do 

414.31 414.73 A: mhm 

415.19 416.42 B: you know so 

417.57 418.39 B: it's um 

418.85 420.18 B: it's coming along but 

421.06 425.01 B: you know that's how i feel about the public schools i feel that 

425.74 426.98 B: more um 

427.09 427.80 B: funds 

428.29 429.29 B: need to be 

429.54 431.00 B: focused on our 

429.70 430.04 A: yeah 

431.88 434.90 B: public school system and that's not only in the 

432.83 433.17 A: yeah 

435.34 436.22 B: in the cities 

436.35 439.35 B: but i'm talking about all over the united states 

439.30 439.70 A: yeah 

441.09 441.55 A: did you 

441.73 442.19 A: are your 

442.59 443.90 A: children's teachers 

444.33 445.86 A: well your they're in grade school 

446.03 447.81 A: when my daughter was in high school 

447.92 451.75 A: i felt that some of her teachers were very pretty poorly prepared 

452.18 452.75 B: hm 

454.26 454.86 B: yeah 

454.76 455.63 A: i was not 

456.23 458.77 A: real excited about the quality of some of her teachers 

460.73 461.51 B: yeah i was 

462.28 468.62 B: yeah some this is another thing (( )) sometimes you you never stop learning that's why you have to be retrained 

469.76 470.19 A: mhm 

470.19 471.20 B: a lot of times 

472.93 474.75 B: hm a lot of times you have to be 

475.34 476.67 B: retrained over 

476.79 478.61 B: just to keep your skills sharpened 

479.25 482.61 A: yeah and i'm really worried that that high school students are not getting enough 

483.90 485.00 A: practice in 

485.27 486.30 A: actual writing 

487.24 488.14 B: or reading 

488.47 488.83 A: yeah 

489.02 490.45 A: but writing where 

489.17 489.57 B: yeah 

491.95 492.48 A: where they're 

492.65 494.27 A: they're gently criticized 

496.21 499.87 A: you know thinking logically being able to organize it being able to get 

500.04 501.06 A: the thoughts down 

503.33 505.56 B: yeah yes i understand what you're saying 

506.76 511.37 B: yeah and i exactly what you're saying yeah because a lot of kids they don't 

512.17 515.54 B: they're not taking emphasis on that you can probably recognize that 

515.92 519.85 B: when they start going to fill out their first applications for the colleges and 

519.89 520.47 A: mhm 

520.56 521.46 B: and jobs 

522.18 524.79 B: some of them already want to start working at fourteen 

527.49 530.44 A: yeah well the literature says that if if you work 

530.84 532.78 A: trying to think how many hours it is 

533.51 535.89 A: think it's less than twenty hours a week
