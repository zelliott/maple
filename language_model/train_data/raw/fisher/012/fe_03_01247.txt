46.33 47.34 A: sure 

48.03 52.05 A: oh i don't know how many minutes [laughter] it is either because you know know more than i do 

52.08 54.45 B: oh i sort of asked a few questions [laughter]

54.63 55.78 B: (( ah derrick )) 

55.42 57.41 A: derrick okay my name is julie 

57.18 66.16 B: julie o- okay um first of all affirmative action does that i have to sort of get a definition on that does that mean um hiring women and men 

57.78 58.58 A: uh-huh 

65.88 67.90 A: yeah i yeah it means ah i think 

66.96 70.33 B: or is it is it like all races and everything 

69.30 72.39 A: yes i think equal opportunity for everyone 

72.38 73.77 B: so that's what it means 

73.40 75.55 A: and it's a ah [noise] 

77.10 81.89 A: they've got you know certain companies now and i don't know how they do it in canada 

82.76 89.56 A: but in the united states ah corporations have have ah policies and plans and have to 

89.67 91.12 A: report 

91.30 97.31 A: um you know keep there's certain certain guidelines they have to follow certain guidelines 

97.03 104.41 B: so they set out guidelines at the beginning and then they have to have so many women so many men so many black people so many white people that sort of thing 

98.15 99.20 A: (( mhm )) 

102.48 103.64 A: right 

103.81 113.43 A: right um i know that i worked at a a tool company um and i was a human resources um 

113.86 115.30 A: specialist 

115.57 117.71 A: and that was one of the things that we w- 

117.99 120.25 A: we were told to put into ah 

120.79 124.02 A: to action however i believe it i 

123.97 136.69 A: mean it's kind of it's kind of slow to get started around united state- i mean they're kind of making sure that you know it's moving across the united states and also think that you have to have a certain number of employees 

136.82 137.87 A: to 

137.23 143.48 B: in order to do something like that yeah you would have to have like a good twenty employees to implement the plan like that right 

142.90 147.39 A: exac- yeah yeah maybe it may be even more than that 

147.61 148.77 A: um 

149.19 150.83 A: and 

151.55 154.90 A: i as far as if i was ever thought if that was a 

156.22 159.16 A: [sigh] a [mn] good thing 

160.68 164.69 A: i would imagine here in texas i haven't noticed a lot of 

165.53 170.29 A: well i know some discrimination still exists but i haven't noticed 

170.48 172.46 A: as much um 

172.21 172.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

172.80 174.94 A: as maybe some other states have 

174.74 176.11 B: right 

175.78 179.55 A: um and i i have no idea how it is in canada 

179.52 184.05 B: well here in it it's not it's not really at all it's only um 

179.63 180.39 A: but 

183.88 197.49 B: like jokingly like chinese drivers chinese are horrible drivers blah blah or women are horrible drivers or something like that right but it's nev- it's not um there's no hatred against any particular race because there's so many races here but it's the same in the states i 

196.90 197.95 A: sure 

197.37 208.60 B: guess it's just that we only have thirty one [laughter] million compared to your [laughter] three hundred and [laughter] sixty five [laughter] that might have something to do with why we're a little where's it easier here we're not so crowded i guess or something 

201.65 203.57 A: [laughter] 

208.24 210.92 A: yeah so it doesn't really affect your job market 

211.39 213.58 B: um well well it can like 

212.71 213.73 A: it can 

213.60 216.48 B: it it yeah i guess so but here it's more 

216.84 225.53 B: i guess it's back to the english tradition where a lot of the high up government jobs and our municipal jobs they just go down to family members but that's the same everywhere 

222.24 223.16 A: mhm 

225.35 226.35 A: right 

225.58 229.37 B: you know it's a sel- select group like if you know somebody 

228.25 230.17 A: if you know somebody right 

230.23 237.56 B: but um as for my view on it i really don't i just think the person that has the best qualifications should get the job 

230.40 231.32 A: right 

237.04 240.05 A: well that's kind of where i am um 

239.24 252.02 B: but i i think what they're they're saying there's a lot of like okay put it for a man and woman for example a lot of men will be sitting back and they don't they don't want a woman they don't want a woman in working around the office so they'll they'll just hire a man like that's wrong 

249.13 250.11 A: right 

251.90 252.97 A: yes 

252.41 255.67 B: but i mean how can you identify that 

256.11 259.40 A: [sigh] yeah because i i exactly 

258.09 260.00 B: because it it's just his 

259.59 262.07 A: because it's masked over nowadays 

261.63 263.38 B: yeah exactly 

262.82 266.88 A: you know it there's some other reason that's thrown out there 

266.92 272.62 B: but i think you're right in a in a large number if there's a large number of employees then it should be implemented 

272.45 274.69 A: yeah i'm i i feel like it's 

275.24 283.46 A: [mn] it's probably a valuable thing and i could say in some parts of our our united states i do think that there's still some 

285.53 288.06 A: i'll just say texas is such a big state 

288.12 289.23 A: um 

289.32 293.26 A: you know california um the the east coast 

293.52 294.66 A: um 

294.76 298.22 A: like i said i think it's it's it's become more who who 

298.23 300.44 A: who has the best qualifications 

300.06 301.29 B: (( mhm right )) 

300.38 314.30 A: the states that i'm most worried about with again are the are the southern states like georgia and alabama and those kind of states that were so slow to come around to 

314.25 315.41 A: um 

315.54 317.93 A: you know accepting um 

318.21 319.99 A: black and ah 

319.57 322.12 B: it's still bad down there even nowadays 

322.26 327.95 A: well [sigh] not as bad but i think it still exists to some extent and some of the 

325.77 326.70 B: yeah 

328.65 331.96 A: in some of the smaller communities um 

330.37 331.56 B: right right 

332.11 338.85 A: like i said i've no- i've not really visited those areas or i would have first hand knowledge um 

339.78 349.17 A: i've just gone on vacation [laughter] i just know from what i've read you know that every now and then i hear about a a little small town in 

349.97 352.77 A: um here or there um 

353.50 357.40 A: that ah it's still having problems with some of that stuff 

357.91 359.11 A: so ah 

359.31 361.21 A: i think that's probably 

361.39 365.17 A: and again you do get the individuals sometimes and um 

365.71 368.80 A: certain corporations that that's just their you know 

369.14 371.03 A: that's just their flaw 

371.17 372.23 B: (( [laughter] yeah right )) 

371.58 373.79 A: you know psychologically 

373.97 377.88 A: about feeling you know oh this person 

378.40 379.31 A: (( you know )) 

379.80 384.41 A: i mean i think [laughter] you know i hate to say male chauvinists but 

385.44 386.77 B: they're there 

385.63 388.76 A: [mn] i think i think they still exist somewhat 

387.62 399.79 B: oh yeah definitely well as for me i'm i'm currently looking for a job and i've been out and i've seen all different races interview me and i've my last interview with two women so i mean when i look at the work place i see everybody 

388.98 389.98 A: you know 

399.48 401.92 A: yeah see i'm looking for a [laughter] job too 

402.31 408.09 A: so um and and there's you know same here i think to me 

408.66 414.10 A: [sigh] i i think what i'm more concerned about than than percentages of 

414.91 416.12 A: um 

416.27 418.69 A: different races and men and women 

418.74 420.22 A: um are 

420.33 428.03 A: older people [laughter] i think to me that's that's kind of a big problem in our united states right now is that 

428.07 430.21 B: there's too many old people working 

428.15 428.88 A: you know 

429.46 433.03 A: is the older you get the harder it is to find a job 

433.11 434.59 B: (( okay i see what you mean )) 

434.39 435.45 A: you know 

434.68 446.06 B: that that's actually not so bad here i think a little bit reversed here a lot of the young people aren't getting a job [laughter] because the older people are taking them as they need them to survive right they're not there's not enough for them to live on 

436.76 437.73 A: yeah 

442.05 442.87 A: (( aha )) 

445.91 447.10 A: mhm 

446.26 448.11 B: (( so they have to work but )) 

447.75 448.80 A: right 

449.19 452.69 A: well i just know a lot o- with all these layoffs that we've had here 

453.36 459.35 A: i just i just know personally i've known a a couple of women that are like approaching sixty 

459.51 464.08 A: and you know they got laid off and they had a true fear of 

465.15 468.97 A: getting a job because they felt like somebody younger was coming in 

468.78 470.13 B: (( [noise] right )) 

469.49 473.85 A: plus the other thing that i've noticed too is um 

475.11 482.94 A: [sigh] younger younger people are introduced to more computer software computer um education in school 

483.34 486.67 A: whereas a lot of older people are having to play catch up 

486.76 490.64 B: and just about everything now is so much it it's just so different 

489.74 491.70 A: [mn] yeah i mean they're having 

490.96 492.09 B: can't keep up 

491.74 495.62 A: i mean i've know that to be true and my situation is that 

497.01 497.89 A: (( um )) 

498.91 510.19 A: i oh i know the computer but i don't know fine points of excel and and um a lot of other software programs and when you go looking for the the ads it says 

510.40 511.43 B: you got to have 

510.98 513.01 A: you have to ha- you have to be 

511.56 514.60 B: excel power point e- everything right yeah 

514.01 517.01 A: yeah power point the whole you know all that and i'm like 

517.16 521.95 A: well i know how to maneuver around it i know the basics but you know 

522.25 530.42 A: can i start from scratch and do something without some guidance or help i don't know i don't feel confident about that so 

530.94 532.09 A: um 

532.35 533.62 A: you know i think 

534.10 539.78 A: i think there's some other areas they need to address besides the [laughter] affirmative action but 

539.97 543.26 A: but see i'm also the per- a person that 

544.12 547.07 A: i don't like a lot of government control either 

547.03 548.27 B: right 

547.66 548.62 A: um 

548.89 550.17 A: that's just not 

550.19 555.81 A: and so i mean i'm thinking it's probably a good situation just to make things more 

556.31 560.85 A: just to make things more equitable but then on the other side of it 

561.45 562.56 A: um 

562.96 564.19 A: i you know 

564.39 567.57 A: i don't like a lot of government interference with some things 

568.06 572.28 A: so um and i don't know if it really applies to this but 

572.36 573.69 A: but um 

573.98 575.01 A: though i just 

574.01 577.69 B: well prob- probably not to this [noise] [noise] 

576.80 582.46 A: yeah no i mean this is this kind of falls outside that you know outside that concern it's just like 

582.80 587.60 A: like the cell phone res- regulat- i don't know if you've got a problem up there but 

587.66 589.22 A: they've got um 

589.72 592.11 A: [mn] they're trying to make it a law in 

592.29 594.11 A: a lot of states that 

594.16 596.28 A: that you can't drive with a cell phone 

596.32 597.66 B: right 

597.12 598.17 A: (( so )) 

598.14 599.89 B: well what do you think about that
