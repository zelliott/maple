16.71 17.63 A: okay i 

17.80 22.14 A: think that what is wrong with public schools today is that they took religion out of it 

22.89 27.74 A: and our kids aren't allowed to pray and i believed that before they did that there wasn't 

27.87 28.95 A: school shootings and 

30.05 30.60 A: um 

32.62 33.36 A: as much 

33.46 33.99 A: um 

34.09 35.86 A: violence as there is today 

36.91 38.99 B: well i absolutely agree with you 

39.20 39.72 B: um 

39.84 42.72 B: i uh was a substitute teacher for twelve years 

43.18 44.17 B: and uh 

44.42 56.21 B: um i'm still in the educational field but i'm not in the schools now um and so i'm just i i've seen it decline so much over the years the 

48.47 48.95 A: right 

56.28 61.45 B: um you know they started with that you know taking prayer out and any um 

62.29 66.96 B: any mention of god or or anything like that and then um 

67.10 75.44 B: you then they couldn't have any corporal punishment and and just really they lost control of the of the kids and uh 

70.86 71.71 A: yeah 

74.33 75.91 A: i believe i believe so 

75.92 84.47 B: and it's just you know we we just watched it for years and years and there's not a whole lot that the teachers can do 

84.16 85.39 A: no there's not 

84.71 86.96 B: um i felt like that the 

87.30 88.54 B: it was kind of political 

88.76 89.15 A: yeah 

89.06 95.14 B: um and you know at that point it uh we kind of lost it of course now with the um 

95.98 97.91 B: uh the economics of it 

98.04 98.73 A: yeah 

98.62 100.58 B: it really you know we're just 

100.72 107.49 B: where where i live we're just our schools are struggling so much and you know i don't um 

108.19 110.77 B: you know i just i just know around here but 

110.83 111.26 A: right 

110.91 116.16 B: um i'm pretty sure that most schools are that way i mean is that is that the way it is where you live 

116.04 120.31 A: yes i feel like that um well our kids are our future so 

120.58 122.46 A: we ought to be uh first of all 

123.33 124.22 A: we may have 

124.95 129.84 A: i think that we may lose some people that would be excellent teachers because the pay isn't high enough here 

129.60 130.23 B: um yeah 

130.42 134.66 A: it's really low i mean you can go do almost anything else and make more money than a teacher 

134.77 135.70 B: uh yeah 

135.52 135.89 A: so 

135.95 138.19 B: they are definitely not in it for the money 

136.00 136.42 A: and 

137.84 138.43 A: right 

138.30 139.19 B: it's a calling 

138.63 141.48 A: so so the teachers that are in it 

141.82 142.31 A: um 

143.63 144.56 A: i feel like 

144.76 155.12 A: um are in it because that's what they want to do which is good but um here anybody can really anybody can go and be a substitute teacher you don't even have to have a degree 

154.79 155.21 B: right 

155.24 156.54 A: just a few c- you know you have to have 

156.89 160.80 A: fifteen college credits or something like that and you can go be a substitute teacher so 

161.86 165.89 B: have any any credits at all you just have to go through training and of course now 

161.87 162.26 A: yeah 

165.20 165.53 A: yup 

166.01 167.56 B: where we are they're 

167.67 168.15 B: um 

168.57 173.43 B: they're begging for substitutes -cause like for volunteers -cause they can't afford to pay 

173.58 173.96 A: right 

173.98 176.24 B: their their regular substitutes and 

175.76 176.26 A: mhm 

176.69 180.14 B: and you know the teachers are being encouraged not to take 

180.39 181.87 B: the time that they have 

181.91 182.27 A: right 

182.69 183.26 B: so 

183.34 185.20 A: so yeah i think we ought to put more in to it 

185.43 186.46 A: than we do 

185.49 191.51 B: well and i've always um like i said i i i've subbed for years and i work um 

186.66 186.96 A: oh 

191.92 195.75 B: i work for a software company that does educational software 

195.86 196.94 B: and uh 

197.08 203.47 B: w- you know w- every everybody is a formal teacher of of some kind and and i think that the thing 

200.16 200.57 A: right 

203.93 206.25 B: is that the people that are making decisions 

206.93 208.96 B: um they are not in the classroom anymore 

209.19 209.59 A: right 

209.58 211.53 B: and you've got people just 

211.66 216.71 B: um e- especially i don't know if you're familiar with it but um 

217.02 223.18 B: you know used to you had just your little core subjects that you taught the kids especially in elementary and 

221.22 221.84 A: right 

223.31 229.11 B: and a teacher could teach it but now they've got so much that they have to meet 

229.37 230.15 B: and uh 

230.49 232.39 B: and they just fly through it 

232.30 232.70 A: uh-huh 

232.91 237.78 B: and the kids don't they're not they're not learning anything if they're spending you know 

237.90 239.42 B: um maybe 

239.93 244.90 B: two weeks on something that that ten years they would've spent two months on 

244.78 245.12 A: right 

245.34 247.30 B: -cause they're just not they're not learning it 

247.46 247.89 B: they're just 

251.42 257.33 A: that i find that my kids i have four kids and every year they become more bored 

257.50 258.30 A: with school 

257.53 258.06 B: mhm 

258.83 260.51 A: because i and i feel like if they 

260.63 266.09 A: spent time more on it like they used to they wouldn't have to spend so much time reviewing it the next year 

266.32 266.85 B: oh yeah 

266.91 272.15 A: that they come home so bored and they don't want to do it and they don't want to do anything because they are 

272.43 276.61 A: they keep they are always constantly telling me that we've already learned this 

276.56 277.25 B: right 

277.35 277.69 A: so 

284.25 284.55 A: yeah 

286.47 287.15 B: got so many 

287.30 288.31 B: students that 

288.41 290.38 B: that they have to wait on 

290.31 290.63 A: hm 

290.52 300.95 B: and the kids that are learning ach they are the ones that end up suffering because they have to wait you know the whole class has to wait for two or three whereas they these two 

301.19 308.24 B: the teacher had time to you know go with the rest of them and then work work on the others one and then they just don't do that anymore 

304.64 305.06 A: right 

308.49 310.60 B: yeah my kids are i've got um 

310.81 311.30 B: um 

311.98 316.21 B: i've got three one in middle school and two in high school 

315.84 316.22 A: mhm 

316.33 317.83 B: and uh you know i get 

318.82 320.52 B: they'll they'll come home and and 

320.97 324.39 B: i'll get stories about especially in math teachers that 

325.57 329.90 B: that you know they have to tell the teacher how the problem is done 

329.56 331.38 A: yes that's terrible 

330.00 338.70 B: and that is that's scary you know especially you know my kids are getting ready to go to um you know college here in a couple of years and and they are not uh 

331.76 333.60 A: that is scary 

339.20 344.08 B: uh you know they are not thrilled or or don't even really trust 

345.01 345.27 B: what 

347.79 348.94 B: what they know 

348.72 349.11 A: yes 

349.35 356.85 B: um so and my son is is really frustrated because he you know he really likes math and he wants to learn new things but 

357.11 361.29 B: he just doesn't feel like the teachers that are teaching him know what they are supposed to be teaching him 

361.31 361.69 A: yes 

361.94 363.17 A: uh i get that too 

361.96 362.46 B: so 

363.24 367.05 B: i think that's really and i i think that's back to 

363.98 364.26 A: so 

367.14 369.63 B: to what they are required to teach them and 

369.75 372.83 B: and the quality of teachers that we have 

373.25 373.81 B: that aren't 

374.00 374.62 B: um 

375.54 377.38 B: uh you know we're losing -em 

377.71 378.15 B: u- uh 

378.24 387.02 B: to higher paying school districts and and states and the ones that just eat the pie are the ones that are sticking around here 

380.32 380.72 A: mhm 

386.83 387.26 A: yeah 

387.39 391.24 B: but uh no i'm just and of course like i said it's so political and uh 

392.14 396.67 A: yes i think it's a big problem i think something is going to have to be done about it before not too long 

396.42 398.84 B: well um you know the uh um 

396.97 397.40 A: (( but )) 

399.73 400.31 B: ach 

401.18 402.35 B: the uh and it's like 

402.89 408.09 B: like where i am um uh the state interferes now so much with the 

408.21 409.56 B: um the local 

410.14 410.59 A: yes 

410.22 412.30 B: um the i- there's just 

413.02 421.31 B: uh like i said i think the politicians ought to be forced to to go in to a classroom not just for one day but for a month 

421.21 421.78 A: uh-huh 

421.70 424.42 B: and they'll change their attitude completely 

423.98 425.48 A: yes i think so 

424.60 429.45 B: because uh you know and i- it it's just it's just sad and we have um 

430.12 431.52 B: we have a new um 

432.15 434.01 B: uh well you know they are starting the the pre 

434.23 434.95 B: pre k. 

435.61 437.20 B: in the public schools now 

437.72 448.88 B: and you know i think that's okay but if we can't afford to pay our you know our regular teachers and they're adding all these other classes where you know i mean i sent my kids to pre school 

442.20 442.70 A: right 

449.19 449.71 B: um 

449.94 451.30 B: and i but i paid for it 

450.95 452.25 A: yeah we did too 

452.10 454.94 B: and i you know i didn't have a problem with that but i just 

454.48 454.85 A: well 

455.41 458.95 A: my kids you know they're i- u- we had to pay for it 

459.27 461.15 A: also but nowadays 

461.37 461.85 A: um 

462.09 464.74 A: have uh friends with with younger children than 

465.02 469.81 A: than i do and they can't they can't even put their kids in pre school because they make too much money 

465.76 466.15 B: mhm 

470.31 470.99 A: in the public 

471.13 471.47 A: school 

471.61 472.03 B: yeah 

472.42 474.92 A: so they they do have to put them in private schools 

475.03 475.31 A: but 

475.15 477.09 B: see i you know i'm not real i'm not real 

477.47 480.82 B: sure how all that works i know with i don't know how the public 

480.92 482.15 B: schools does it with uh 

482.68 484.36 B: with the pre k. so 

484.67 488.55 B: you know w- w- back when i was doing it you just looked around for 

489.00 498.76 B: for a good one and and it was you know you you sometimes they had waiting lists and i'm glad i did because my kids love to learn but i don't think um 

490.14 490.60 A: yeah 

499.20 501.03 B: i don't think it's going to help because 

500.75 501.10 A: no 

501.44 502.43 B: um i know the 

502.54 505.93 B: the last couple of years that i substituted i also um
