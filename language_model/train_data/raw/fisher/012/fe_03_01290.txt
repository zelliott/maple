206.41 211.85 A: (( you know that that made me really realize you know this is no reason to fight there )) 

212.13 214.09 A: (( is no reason )) 

212.80 217.81 B: (( as wasteful lives i think that the u._s. could have resolved it another way )) 

218.39 225.90 B: (( i don't think that the war um [lipsmack] )) 

226.08 235.19 B: (( to me it makes no sense because really once the war is over they're gonna be back in the same situation or worse than they were when they started even though )) 

235.15 242.40 B: (( they may saddam hussein may not be there any more you have to think well who's gonna take his place [noise] mhm )) 

243.13 247.67 A: there is no reason to fight or to sacrifice their lives 

247.13 248.32 B: right 

248.81 254.38 A: but they have to be there they were assigned to be there right right by the government 

252.65 254.92 B: yeah correct 

254.89 257.88 A: so that means they don't really have that strong motivation 

258.43 269.33 A: i mean many you know looking at looking back at the history there was s- strong reason to fight for such as independence of their country 

269.38 275.29 A: or just to blah blah blah but yeah and also um 

275.46 279.38 A: watching the t._v. pr- news it it 

279.53 284.19 A: really looks like a fictitious you know it's it's like video games or something 

283.90 286.51 B: yeah you're absolutely right 

285.87 298.89 A: yeah especially i don't really have any family members or anyone that i know [sigh] in service so it's kind of you know just video games or you know just kind of movie yeah 

298.82 304.77 B: well you're already they're already going into a company that the poverty level is very high 

305.16 312.56 B: so how do you feel like going into war is gonna help these people actually you're worsening their situation as well as 

312.52 323.52 B: there are gonna be a lot of innocent lives a lot of innocent people that are gonna die for no reason and their country is gonna be worse off when it's all right when it's all said and done with 

317.32 318.58 A: right 

319.88 321.56 A: after the war yeah 

323.13 337.91 A: and also i'm guessing all those you know upper class people or some people you know related to saddam hussein have left the country already you know or they might having like vacations somewhere nicer you know 

337.51 338.68 B: right 

338.08 340.53 A: i don't think that they are gonna be staying there so 

341.41 343.07 A: (( all those )) 

343.15 348.54 A: ordinary people no place to go to you know to move to 

344.23 345.28 B: mhm 

349.32 353.30 A: (( so and also like women and children you know mhm )) 

352.68 364.52 B: yeah so if you wanted to actually i was gonna say if you wanted to actually help their country each time they let a missile off i think someone was telling me it's like a million dollars for each missile that they let off 

364.35 376.30 B: that's money that you could put into the country to to help the country rather than bringing the country down and then you say you wanna rebuild the country that that that makes no sense whatsoever [noise] 

376.98 381.03 A: that's true 'cause some people told me that i mean you know all 

381.20 383.65 A: those you know um missiles 

383.77 385.76 A: are i mean if 

386.05 393.12 A: from the american perspective after the war their economy is gonna get better because 

393.28 396.65 A: they need to you know um produce 

396.68 401.42 A: like those army product- prod- products supplies 

400.81 401.92 B: mhm 

401.78 405.33 A: so they need to hire more people more labor 

405.96 409.00 A: i i don't know where it started but 

409.67 413.74 A: in terms from the american perspective the war might 

413.76 418.09 A: affect positively on their economy e- especially you know 

418.12 421.87 A: the economy in this country has been really really slow 

421.91 425.77 A: and unemployment unemployment is really high 

425.37 426.49 B: right 

426.73 429.07 A: so i don't know which way 

427.59 430.25 B: a lot of companies are are are cutting their 

430.76 432.68 B: due to the war yeah 

430.82 431.71 A: so 

432.09 433.44 A: yeah 

432.82 437.35 B: and and so forth so it it's not helping the economy at all 

437.30 449.42 B: because a a lot of companies you know they're cutting their workforces because they're not making as much money as as they usually would be making i was just watching something about the airlines they're gonna be cutting 

437.36 438.25 A: oh 

449.36 462.46 B: a lot of employees 'cause people are are afraid to fly right now so it's it's not gonna help the economy it it may get better in the end and then again it it may not if you think about what happened september the eleventh 

462.25 466.42 B: the con- the economy hasn't gotten any better since then [noise] 

465.80 471.20 A: oh that's true yeah it has been really slow since then right 

471.75 472.96 A: but um 

473.74 474.78 A: well 

475.69 485.50 A: but the c- the country has to send a lot of you know military supplies to the servicemen in i- iraq right now 

484.93 486.06 B: right 

485.68 494.00 A: so they've got to spend all the you know stocks stock they they i i've heard that 

494.01 502.46 A: since there was not any major war or major fight i- in the world a lot of you know um s- 

499.94 501.04 B: mhm 

502.67 507.01 A: stuff they stocked up like in the garage or somewhere 

506.45 508.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

507.44 521.00 A: [laughter] but it so this war can be a good chance good time for them to spend all of them and then they can produce something new some new product and hire more people but but 

519.37 520.55 B: right 

521.18 527.87 A: i don't really know i don't really have any background in economy or anything but in terms of you know um 

528.05 536.08 A: like human rights or justice yeah i don't see the reason why they started a to the they they started the war 

536.43 539.60 B: may i ask you a question what country are you originally from 

539.13 542.13 A: oh i'm from korea south korea 

540.75 545.88 B: how do how do people feel where you're from about the war do they oppose the war 

546.24 548.08 A: yeah and also 

548.31 555.33 A: um my parents' generation went through the war the korean war i would say my my father 

555.37 567.89 A: my my parents' generation they really you know experienced the vietnamese war there were like many koreans guys in the middle age guys in the seventies who were sent to the vietnamese 

559.83 560.94 B: mhm 

567.91 573.22 A: vietnamese vietnam war by the american government or by the korean government 

573.39 575.80 A: my father was one of them too 

575.88 580.37 A: so they know you know how horr- horrible how you know 

580.71 582.89 A: what the war is like 

582.64 583.93 B: right 

582.93 590.62 A: so i would say that most of most of the people i i have known in korea opposed to the war 

591.38 593.01 A: yeah but um 

594.08 595.53 A: but um 

595.82 599.37 A: we have like north korea all the time
