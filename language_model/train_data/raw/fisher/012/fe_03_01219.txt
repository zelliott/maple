100.11 100.84 A: importance

125.85 126.72 B: her biggest 

127.18 133.55 B: uh you know pro- problem seemed to be with the administration and also with the attitude of of the children 

134.33 135.35 B: and like i

162.28 168.42 B: uh i i i i you know i don't get the impression that uh one of the biggest problems 

168.59 172.45 B: um at least with the northern virginia public schools is money 

173.17 178.43 B: um the problems is with a lot of things because other things uh because 

178.82 182.87 B: and i i know of a few people who are teachers trying to keep 

182.97 183.68 B: the 

183.83 191.19 B: uh uh young people's attention to really want to learn and to really want to put uh 

191.78 194.53 B: uh forth a lot of effort into um 

195.22 196.10 B: um you know 

196.24 200.66 B: the quality of the education uh they they spend more time 

200.87 206.84 B: um being parents to the students as opposed to teaching the students (( )) 

206.94 208.95 B: there biggest complaint you know 

209.21 211.70 B: from some of the you know teachers that i know 

212.10 212.95 B: that they 

213.14 218.45 B: you know by the time they get home they're so worn out by trying to keep a lot of the kids 

218.56 219.71 B: in in in 

219.81 220.38 B: in 

221.07 222.13 B: you know in uh 

221.47 225.24 A: so this is not teaching anymore they're having to do a a lot of parenting also 

229.36 240.97 B: and trying to teach you know good you know manners and and teaching you know teaching things that the par- i mean doing things that the parents should be doing at home and 

241.13 250.47 B: it wears them out and they are not spending as much time on teaching even those who have the um not not all schools have uh 

259.08 265.13 B: of things like the computers and good funding but still even with that uh they were saying that 

265.25 274.81 B: the values and the uh the respect and the you know the other things that they feel that they should be getting at home is just not there 

276.12 279.50 B: okay along with some of the other things in terms of 

291.35 291.97 B: which was 

292.33 294.84 B: you know over twenty years ago um 

295.68 298.11 B: we were shocked to see how 

323.66 326.84 B: took for granted that we were supposed to have when we were coming through 

327.04 333.19 B: so um under funding is a a problem i i agree with you there 

333.12 337.19 A: it is i mean eh it's not obviously the only problem they're they're a lot of 

335.94 336.52 B: mhm 

337.14 337.63 B: mhm 

337.47 340.70 A: different areas which all have contributed to the 

338.55 339.06 B: yeah 

341.28 343.75 A: decline in the education system 

343.19 343.58 B: right 

344.73 346.33 A: but it's interesting i didn't know that 

346.56 347.87 A: a lot of teachers felt 

348.02 349.92 A: at at least from your experience of having 

350.12 351.56 A: dealt with them that they felt that 

352.39 354.23 A: uh the home values 

354.53 357.49 A: were were a big problem for them as far as them 

356.56 361.08 B: yes most certainly yes they they that's a 

361.25 362.43 B: you know uh 

362.81 370.89 B: they put a lot of emphasis on that because you know my girlfriend always talking about how she so worn out when she comes home she said um i thi- 

371.03 373.52 B: i spend so much time trying to 

374.29 379.04 B: you know be a parent as as opposed to being a a teacher 

379.17 382.82 B: and she was saying that a lot of her students are on medication 

399.47 400.95 B: trying to uh 

401.06 402.33 B: trying to address 

402.43 403.78 B: you know trying to keep 

403.66 404.03 A: right 

404.02 412.63 B: just trying to keep them calm and you know keep order in the classroom and and not really put a lot of emphasis on teaching and she's a very good teacher 

412.78 414.12 A: right i mean 

413.18 414.92 B: you know and she loves what she does 

414.44 414.96 A: mhm 

415.12 420.87 A: i mean that in itself is taking on an an an extremely large load i mean teaching itself is a difficult task 

421.00 422.19 B: yes yes 

421.70 422.34 A: um 

422.46 426.59 A: and from that to add on the parenting aspect of it and 

426.19 426.84 B: yeah 

426.84 431.92 A: it's hard enough to be a parent to one child i can't imagine how difficult it could be to be a parent to like 

432.24 433.95 A: a class of twenty children 

433.66 435.63 B: that's right that's right 

434.98 435.64 A: um

449.40 450.38 A: did i understand 

452.07 454.34 A: what exactly was she dissatisfied with 

453.90 462.96 B: well she she um well we were talking just the other day she was saying something about um they don't respect them um they're just 

463.07 463.79 B: um 

464.88 465.46 B: um 

481.25 484.64 B: robots they're the they're there just come in 

485.01 495.16 B: you know just get in the classroom do the best you can and they don't listen and they just don't get the kind of respect that they used to get as teachers 

495.91 496.78 B: and um

538.24 540.50 B: by october the teacher had quit 

546.61 555.03 B: some of them are even the younger ones are even willing to go back to school to go into something totally different because it's very hard it's a very difficult profession

558.02 561.68 A: yeah actually in in college i had some friends who aspired to be teachers
