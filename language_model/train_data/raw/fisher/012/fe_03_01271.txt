127.48 129.19 A: it just makes me angry 

129.16 131.59 B: i know 'cause you you know what i think i think 

131.68 132.93 B: the people 

133.03 135.23 B: are still thinking of vietnam 

134.88 135.99 A: yeah 

135.93 141.09 B: and i think when they think of war they think of that long drawn out war 

142.47 155.31 A: yeah that's probably true they just had a guy i don't know if you watch c._n._n. right now but they just had a guy on c._n._n. probably not even three minutes ago an iraqi guy that said uh that he expects this to go on for years if we don't give up 

155.02 155.84 B: [laughter] 

155.59 156.90 A: and i'm thinking 

156.54 157.76 B: no i don't 

156.96 160.44 A: i don't think you don't have enough country to last for years 

160.27 162.07 B: no [laughter] 

161.17 167.74 A: [laughter] as bad as that sounds i mean look what we did in one night don't don't please don't make us stay for years [laughter] 

164.40 165.65 B: mhm 

166.81 168.12 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

168.27 170.04 A: that would be bad for you 

170.18 172.24 B: bad for them absolutely 

172.75 175.54 B: and i have a son who's gonna be turning eighteen so 

176.27 185.38 B: and he's been thinking about going active duty and he kinda follows what's going on he relies on me or other people school whatever to tell him 

185.81 187.37 B: you know what's going on 

187.16 188.38 A: yeah 

187.92 190.89 B: and it hasn't really swayed his decision y- any 

192.25 193.94 B: to go active duty 

193.94 199.11 A: yeah i think i i joined the guard right in ninety two so it was right after desert storm 

199.21 206.83 A: and i was hoping that i wouldn't see anything [laughter] but of course i was only planning on staying in for six years and now i'm going on eleven 

201.48 202.58 B: uh-huh 

207.27 208.17 B: wow 

207.31 210.98 A: so i guess i should have figured that eventually my luck would run out 

211.34 214.76 A: i wouldn't join now if i wasn't already in that's for sure 

214.34 215.48 B: mhm 

215.04 218.49 A: but i don't have any desire to get out right now either 

220.26 226.80 A: it's just kind of scary wondering i have a son also a husband and a son now my son's nineteen months old 

226.82 229.27 A: and i keep thinking what a bummer that would be if 

229.81 230.71 A: i had 

229.83 231.12 B: does that matter 

231.37 233.65 A: uh no not really [laughter] no 

232.38 234.48 B: no they would still take you 

234.14 239.36 A: you get a couple of months right after they're born i think they give you i don't know last i heard was four months 

239.80 251.06 A: and uh 'cause a friend of mine has a a friend of mine has a daughter who's in who uh just had a baby and she's active duty and the day after the baby turned four months they she got deployed 

250.83 251.98 B: wow 

251.58 253.63 A: so that would be pretty horrible 

253.22 254.36 B: yeah 

254.99 256.29 B: that's for sure 

257.86 262.72 B: so does the uh army like send you any information like what's going on no 

260.69 261.66 A: no 

262.08 263.62 A: no not really 

263.08 265.28 B: no briefings or anything like that 

264.80 265.76 A: no 

266.03 266.96 A: we just 

266.22 270.61 B: 'cause i take these classes these aromatherapy classes and um 

271.20 272.80 B: the woman who owns 

272.87 275.20 B: minerva she um 

275.26 276.59 B: she's a nurse 

276.81 277.69 B: um 

277.85 280.66 B: i guess she's well i don't know what you would call that 

282.05 292.12 B: [mn] part time whatever she's enlisted but doesn't go active duty unless she's called and she was called back in october to go 

285.16 286.10 A: mhm 

287.31 288.15 A: right 

292.72 294.30 B: in paraguay 

294.47 295.48 A: oh 

295.12 301.27 B: [laughter] on the field there and and she said when she got called that she got all this briefing and stuff 

302.13 309.35 A: yeah probably if we got if we got closer we would get briefings and stuff but as for i mean we've had people from our base that have gone 

302.56 304.48 B: [sigh] to go in yeah 

309.64 310.53 A: but 

310.74 312.36 A: not not my 

312.49 315.37 A: specialty exactly hasn't been called yet so 

316.53 318.24 B: and what's your specialty in there 

317.90 327.16 A: i'm services which is a whole combination of everything from the cooks to running the morgue [laughter] and everything in between 

324.98 328.03 B: oh [laughter] 

327.42 331.46 A: but no combat and i don't fly a jet or anything like that so 

330.58 331.85 B: [laughter] 

332.52 336.22 A: and i have never jumped out of a plane that everybody always asks me that too 

334.08 336.82 B: [laughter] 

338.52 342.48 B: well that's good [laughter] we'll know that we can do that [laughter] 

339.43 340.55 A: yeah 

342.79 344.80 A: so i've been lucky so far 

345.88 347.79 A: and hoping to stay lucky [laughter] 

348.18 352.78 A: i'm figuring eventually my luck will run out [laughter] i don't think i can avoid going forever 

352.76 355.22 B: well i think if it lasts a long time 

355.33 357.90 B: then you might i know my ex husband he 

358.68 362.15 B: has ninety days that they could call him active again 

361.86 363.03 A: yeah 

362.43 363.42 B: to go 

364.55 373.70 A: yeah well when we joined there it was pretty much a given that you could you know you might get called you would do one weekend a month and two weeks out of your summer 

373.24 374.34 B: mhm 

373.70 377.13 A: and then there's always the possibility of having to go longer 

377.00 389.41 A: and right after uh nine eleven they told us that if we got called up anywhere it would be for ninety days which to me at that time just sounded crazy i'm thinking being away from home for ninety days oh my gosh 

388.88 389.85 B: yeah 

389.23 393.13 A: well now it's gone from that to six months to a year if we go anywhere 

392.80 394.94 B: uh-huh that's how long he was gone 

393.44 399.58 A: so [laughter] i'm thinking uh ninety days sounded really good [laughter] i'll take those ninety days now [laughter] 

396.66 398.18 B: [laughter] 

398.59 399.79 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

400.31 404.80 B: well that's originally what hugh had gone for ninety days to germany 

404.90 407.76 B: and then they told him uh-uh you're staying longer 

407.43 408.62 A: oh goodness 

407.96 409.70 B: so he was there nine months 

409.48 411.80 A: (( nine months wow )) 

410.15 412.08 B: yeah in germany 

412.45 413.94 A: holy smoke i 

413.35 415.47 B: yeah 

415.68 420.33 A: have a friend whose husband has been over to saudi arabia twice in the last year 

420.56 421.43 B: (( oh )) 

421.15 425.28 A: i'm thinking i don't really wanna do that desert thing [laughter] 

424.61 425.57 B: (( uh-uh )) 

426.00 428.93 A: i keep telling them i'm allergic to sand [laughter] 

427.76 429.86 B: [laughter] 

429.17 433.63 A: can send me to germany or something but i i don't really wanna go to the desert i 

433.04 433.84 B: [laughter] 

433.90 437.41 B: or you could be called to paraguay i mean like whoever heard of paraguay 

436.63 438.98 A: (( don't think i don't even know where paraguay is )) 

437.97 440.66 B: [laughter] 

440.70 441.74 A: oh wow 

441.41 446.96 B: that that was just a short mission she went did her i think she was gone two weeks that was it 

447.03 451.72 A: (( oh that'd be all right i would go to paraguay for two weeks what the hey just to say you've been there )) 

447.89 449.20 B: then brought back 

449.60 451.35 B: yeah yeah 

451.64 456.53 B: and being a nurse she could be called so i'm sure she's really glued to the t._v. all the time too [laughter] 

454.96 456.21 A: oh yeah 

456.24 460.40 A: yeah they probably would want nurses more than they would want cooks right now [laughter] 

457.93 458.97 B: uh-huh 

459.70 463.56 B: especially the way it's going now them capturing us and everything i 

463.19 464.46 A: yeah 

465.10 466.47 B: mean that's horrible 

466.51 470.18 A: and it's horrible that some of the stuff the media are showing 

470.62 475.65 B: well thank god they're not showing that picture where those u._s. soldiers were 

475.66 477.80 B: shot execution style 

477.68 479.30 A: yeah i heard about that 

479.60 480.69 B: awful

481.95 485.82 B: no they said they weren't gonna air it in the united states but 

486.08 487.55 B: that al jeera 

488.47 491.40 B: was showing it there in iraq 

489.73 490.55 A: (( oh )) 

491.41 494.35 B: they're getting their jollies out of that i'm sure but 

493.70 497.90 A: yeah i heard about that yesterday and i thought oh man did i miss something [laughter] 

497.29 500.31 B: no i wouldn't even wanna see that 

499.63 505.40 A: no i probably wouldn't either but it's kinda like one of you know a car accident you don't really wanna see it but you can't help but look 

504.81 507.21 B: yeah that's true that's true 

508.14 510.10 A: and then for that mother that 

510.39 514.20 A: found out her son was a p._o._w. watching filipino t._v. 

513.87 515.03 B: mhm

527.92 530.95 A: that's what she was saying too she just was watching it and 

530.87 534.74 B: you know i guess that was her on a._o._l. that her had her hand cupped over 

534.85 535.95 B: her mouth 

535.76 537.02 A: (( i don't i'm not sure ))
