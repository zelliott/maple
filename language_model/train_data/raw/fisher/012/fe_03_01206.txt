201.04 202.54 B: you know [sigh]

206.95 208.79 A: (( yeah yeah i know what you're saying )) 

216.22 228.10 A: yeah i mean when when you talk about best friends you have to like take into consideration like you know like when you just have regular friends i mean if they are competitive with you you can have jealousy and competition 

222.81 223.71 B: uh-huh 

228.31 234.18 A: and you know yeah you can have friends like that but you cannot have a best friend like that you know and 

233.43 234.89 B: right 

235.05 244.64 B: yeah i w- i wouldn't do it i don't you know there are still lots of times in my life you know and probably just this morning i said boy i wish i had a million bucks [laughter] you know 

244.40 245.70 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

244.85 252.52 B: but [laughter] but you know when you think about it what would you do for that million dollars and and i [sigh]

275.31 276.76 A: [laughter] yeah 

277.72 279.26 A: [laughter] oh 

279.69 282.30 A: but um yeah i i you know 

282.51 285.75 A: i mean money you can never have enough of it you know 

285.51 286.87 B: right 

285.85 296.17 A: but at the same time i mean a person with a whole bunch of money and no and no love or happiness then no i i'd rather not 

292.90 294.05 B: mhm 

296.20 307.06 B: me too me too 'cause 'cause like i said the older i the older i get the more perspective you get on life you know and hopefully learn [laughter] from your mistakes 

307.06 311.89 B: and your priorities start changing you know and and when you're young 

312.00 325.56 B: you know you go to school you work really hard you know you're trying to build a future you're just driven you know and money seems to be real important but when you get older it it just isn't that important any more 

324.91 335.72 A: yeah yeah i mean i mean to to me like let's say bill gate right now [laughter] i mean money is nothing to him but i mean there's a lot of people out there that [mn] just doesn't like him 

328.72 329.85 B: mhm 

331.05 332.22 B: right 

335.24 336.36 B: uh-huh 

336.23 347.15 A: and like th- they i mean there are people who just want to get get you know with them because of his money you know and you know you can never find you know 

347.30 350.32 A: true friendship or true love that way you know 

349.58 356.05 B: mhm i just and i wonder you know how many people because they have all that money 

356.07 366.28 B: how many people can he really say are his true friends that don't have some alternative motive behind you know getting close to bill gates 

359.23 360.58 A: yeah 

365.57 366.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

366.70 368.81 A: yeah that's that's true 

369.62 372.25 B: and they'd they'd always be hitting you up i mean 

372.60 377.31 B: [sigh] who wants money on that that amount of money i would like to be comfortable 

377.06 378.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

377.45 387.22 B: and and not worry about um whether i'm gonna pay the p._g. and e. bill next month you know or the telephone bill [laughter] or whatever um 

383.51 384.47 A: yeah 

387.22 400.81 B: and i'd like to have a little bit locked away for you know in case you get sick you can't work you you know th- those kinds of things and and build a little bit of a retirement but to have a a large amount of money just think of the 

400.82 406.17 B: of the uh headaches that you all all of a sudden things that you've never had to deal with before 

405.89 407.26 A: [laughter] mhm yeah 

406.48 407.52 B: you know 

407.33 408.51 A: that's true 

408.80 416.83 B: and i and i just don't think money brings happiness i think it just brings a whole bunch of of extra problems [laughter] that you don't have [laughter] 

415.15 419.20 A: i mean i mean enough money to use is happiness 

418.66 419.87 B: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

419.31 424.71 A: but but when you have too much money then you know you always have to watch your back you know 

423.99 425.04 B: right 

425.63 433.01 B: right so why would i give up my best friend you know that i have now i can depend on 

431.44 433.73 A: (( right [sigh] for for a million bucks )) 

433.04 437.86 B: to have a million bucks and have a bunch of people that i have to watch my back with i mean 

437.22 438.42 A: yeah 

438.19 440.03 B: doesn't make any sense 

439.85 450.59 A: i i mean you know like [mn] the the part of having a best friend that money can't buy is that like if if you're in trouble like you went bankruptcy you know 

449.44 450.49 B: mhm 

451.09 457.31 A: your best friend will be the one to pick you up and take him to his home to live with him you know 

456.70 457.81 B: right 

457.40 462.48 A: but if you have a million dollars if you have a million dollars and something bad happens 

463.00 465.17 A: you know and that million dollars gone 

465.00 465.98 B: uh-huh 

465.98 470.27 A: you know bad business or something and that million dollars gone i mean then you have 

470.86 473.18 A: (( nothing you know i mean )) 

471.01 472.34 B: exactly 

472.99 474.70 B: you have the streets 

474.72 475.65 A: (( yeah you have nothing )) 

474.75 477.39 B: that's all you have 

477.41 489.64 B: you know i have often i've often wondered when i've seen stories about homeless people and um they talk to them and and at one time they had a beautiful home and they had beautiful family 

489.61 494.41 B: and they had everything they wanted and then for some reason you know they lost everything 

494.13 495.32 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

494.72 500.36 B: but why are they on the street they must not have had good friends you know 

498.37 500.23 A: yeah yeah 

502.81 505.80 A: right it's really hard i mean right now i'm 

505.85 506.69 A: like 

507.23 520.47 A: like the one best friend i have is in san diego but i have a lot of friends around me but then each of them there is something about them that that [mn] keeps them away from becoming my best friend you know 

509.99 511.13 B: mhm 

520.26 525.21 B: right you don't really let them into you right inside of you 

520.84 521.61 A: like 

523.60 527.93 A: i mean like 'cause like 'cause like you see that they are not truthful to you 

527.63 528.76 B: uh-huh 

528.47 535.06 A: you know like some of like how how many people do you think are gonna bend backwards for you in this world you know 

534.52 535.91 B: right 

535.12 536.95 A: it's not very many people 

537.04 538.05 A: and um 

539.17 549.18 A: like my i mean most of my friends are just competition competitive you know either like playing sport with me basketball or in school 

544.34 545.26 B: mhm 

548.34 549.27 B: mhm 

549.05 554.77 A: you know which is okay i mean co- competitiveness is like the nature of of people you know 

554.36 555.35 B: right 

555.46 564.76 A: but i don't mind that but because of of them being competitiveness sometimes they being shady with you you know as far as like sharing sharing stuff with you 

560.99 562.06 B: mhm 

564.63 565.65 B: right 

565.61 570.85 A: and so i mean it's really hard to find a to find a friend where 

570.98 572.89 A: he's not competitive with you 

573.07 576.27 A: he's just out there a hundred percent to help you 

576.73 581.24 A: you know and just you know if if you get something he's just happy 

581.35 583.12 A: happy for you you know 

582.28 583.37 B: mhm 

584.09 585.50 A: so i mean 

586.08 587.79 A: it's really hard 

586.19 587.21 B: yeah that's 

587.24 591.35 B: that's definitely worth worth a lot more so you play basketball 

590.91 592.59 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

591.95 594.17 B: oh cool who's your favorite team
