24.15 24.64 A: do you 

24.65 30.72 B: yeah because then i can stop and you know i can get my popcorn and i can stretch out on the couch and 

31.00 33.42 B: and stuff what you prefer going to the movies 

33.57 41.04 A: um i'm kind of torn because um i usually like them at home but if they're um like real visual ones 

40.91 43.41 B: oh then you want to go see them on the big screen 

41.55 41.91 A: i like 

43.11 45.40 A: right i think it's a little better on the big screen 

45.51 49.70 B: yeah uh i well i'd have to agree with like star wars or something like that 

48.30 50.00 A: exactly stuff like that 

50.15 54.30 B: yeah that's true yeah i would have to agree with you on that sometime i see the movies and i'm like

56.10 56.98 A: right 

56.62 57.92 B: yeah 

58.68 62.29 A: so now we're supposed to ask each what was the last movie that you saw 

62.26 65.95 B: yeah was it good or bad okay you go first on that one 

65.16 69.26 A: uh well we just had a baby so we haven't been in a while i think that 

69.00 73.79 B: congratulations it'll probably be a while again before you see another movie 

69.86 70.66 A: oh (( )) 

71.55 71.83 A: i 

71.99 72.69 A: know

82.67 83.44 B: oh 

84.35 85.34 B: yeah was it good 

85.43 88.30 A: it was okay i thought it was going to be terrible but it wasn't that bad 

90.25 91.04 B: is it like a 

91.14 92.27 B: a chick flick 

92.06 93.25 A: yeah for sure 

93.76 96.19 A: so she dragged me to that one 

95.32 99.52 B: well you know she just had a baby you've got to be nice to her 

96.29 97.33 A: wasn't too bad 

98.88 99.78 A: right 

99.89 101.62 A: what about you what was the last one you saw 

101.59 104.14 B: uh that uh sweet home alabama 

105.34 106.17 A: which was that 

106.08 112.49 B: it's uh and actually we saw it at home it's on video oh it's that girl with blonde hair she's really cute oh 

112.33 115.14 A: oh yeah yeah i saw the commercials for that 

114.85 117.02 B: okay yeah it's like a romantic comedy 

116.98 120.47 A: she's torn between that guy in alabama and that guy in new york or something like that 

117.12 117.48 B: and she's 

119.31 123.05 B: yeah yeah that one and of course i thought you know it was like 

121.27 121.77 A: was it good 

129.98 130.54 A: right 

132.31 132.94 A: right 

145.56 147.01 B: not have to think about 

147.45 148.76 B: whatever i'm watching 

149.62 151.40 B: you know so 

151.52 155.84 B: but and i was trying to think of another one i had just oh the sum of all fears have you seen that one 

156.74 157.61 A: uh no 

158.00 159.16 B: that's uh 

159.58 160.74 A: that was with um 

159.64 160.08 B: oh 

160.97 161.88 A: ben affleck 

162.37 163.27 B: is that who is that 

162.88 163.42 A: was that it 

163.46 164.95 B: is that who it is he's that young 

164.38 165.86 A: and then morgan freeman 

165.63 166.32 B: yeah 

166.74 167.18 A: yeah 

166.82 167.32 B: yeah 

167.54 169.03 B: that was really good that was a good 

168.57 169.22 A: that was good 

169.50 171.37 B: yeah it was a good action flick 

170.16 170.43 A: huh 

171.52 175.34 B: now it would have mar- better if it had harrison ford because he's the guy who was supposed to be 

176.29 176.84 A: right 

176.92 178.18 B: you know that thing 

178.46 179.90 A: that jack ryan or whoever he plays 

179.52 180.26 B: yeah 

180.41 182.59 B: yeah so i mean i think it would have been 

182.73 186.05 B: you know with it but yeah i thought it was you know a good action flick 

186.24 186.64 A: yeah 

186.75 187.23 B: you know 

186.85 190.92 A: and yeah it would it probably would have been better with harrison ford i can't stand ben affleck 

197.00 197.76 A: right 

199.89 200.46 A: right 

203.77 204.74 A: yeah i agree 

205.10 211.32 B: but yeah so i think it would have been a lot better with harrison ford in it but i think it was saved because of morgan freeman 

211.46 212.74 A: he's good he's real good 

212.55 218.39 B: he he is really good and he's the one who saved it i think if they'd a had somebody else in there it wouldn't have you know 

218.53 219.56 A: i have to rent that one 

219.84 220.62 B: yeah 

220.85 226.25 B: yeah it's good and it it's out on video now because i know because we saw it on video i can't remember the last time we actually 

226.43 227.92 B: went to a movie theater 

228.10 228.67 A: yeah 

228.91 230.98 B: you know it's just so expensive and 

231.75 234.07 B: and everything and and we have two children so 

234.34 236.97 B: by the time you pay babysitters and then go to a movie you're 

237.71 238.19 B: you know 

238.12 240.49 A: especially if you go at ni- i mean in in the daytime it's not 

240.99 241.39 A: bad but if 

241.51 243.76 A: going up to like eight or nine dollars and then 

243.53 244.75 B: oh yeah 

244.49 248.01 A: because usually you know most of the time you're not that crazy about it you walk out and you're like 

256.21 257.05 A: right 

257.48 258.54 A: could be a big difference 

259.14 266.72 B: yeah but yeah so that's why you know he's always like you know (( )) we're much easier to please when the movies are cheaper 

260.10 260.53 A: yeah 

266.53 267.38 A: right 

266.91 270.82 B: we expect a lot more when we pay good money for them 

270.13 274.35 A: ri- had to pay twenty bucks for a movie i get mad if it's not a good movie 

273.71 280.62 B: yeah yeah exactly you know and it's hard it's hard to live up to that kind of money 

280.85 282.00 B: on a movie 

282.09 286.32 B: unless it's something really spectacular i guess with really good special effects or something 

287.29 290.32 B: you know like i guess the star wars ones or something 

290.93 291.22 B: but 

291.56 292.92 B: but yeah so 

293.69 294.86 B: i'm trying to think of 

295.00 297.35 B: any other ones i've seen recently 

297.60 299.11 A: what are some of your favorite all time ones 

299.94 302.42 B: oh well you've never heard of my all time one it's

323.10 323.60 A: wow 

323.76 325.19 B: yeah so that would be 

325.53 336.55 B: that's that's my fav- i'm trying to think of a favorite one that like you know you might know that's really but i mean you know most movies it's like oh they're like okay but they don't stick with you for some reason in fact i've even 

336.82 341.36 B: the book is out of print but i did did manage to get a copy of the book and read it one time 

342.28 343.30 B: it's a chick flick 

343.41 343.73 B: total 

343.99 346.42 B: total romance war romance thing 

346.52 347.05 B: you know 

346.62 347.19 A: right 

347.46 349.20 B: it's a girl thing

351.78 352.62 B: all time favorite 

352.98 354.74 A: uh 

358.43 361.05 A: tough i i would say maybe um 

361.45 366.97 A: one movie that's kind of like an obscure movie that i really like (( )) and whenever someone doesn't know what to 

367.12 369.52 A: rent for a rental i was i always recommend this one 

369.95 371.03 A: it's called the dead zone 

371.85 374.14 B: the name sounds really familiar 

374.13 380.20 A: it's um it's a ste- it was a stephen king novel that they made into a movie and it stars um 

380.57 381.69 A: christopher walken 

382.18 382.97 B: okay 

382.95 384.73 A: oh it's so good 

384.64 385.35 B: is it 

385.29 385.74 A: yeah 

385.54 386.89 B: now is it like scary 

387.31 389.25 B: or is it just one of those thoughtful 

387.48 388.23 A: um it's 

389.78 394.00 A: it's it's it's not like a it's not like a monster movie like most 

389.86 390.30 B: te- 

393.19 394.33 B: like a horror movie 

394.11 399.57 A: yeah it's not really like a horror movie it's kind of like uh it's kind of like an intellectual kind of a horror kind of a um 

400.19 402.70 A: but it's more like story driven than you know monster driven 

402.70 403.26 B: right 

403.20 411.29 A: but it's really good the whole story line and then you know i hate movies where you where you go all of a sudden oh yeah right that would really happen 

411.26 412.47 B: right yeah 

411.96 417.75 A: you know i mean you kind of follow along even though it's farfetched it kind of you know it couldn't i guess it could kind of happen 

417.75 418.50 B: right 

418.88 420.81 A: but yeah keep that in mind if you're ever going to rent one 

420.27 420.60 B: (( ))
