71.86 72.69 A: that yes 

73.60 74.01 A: that one 

74.70 75.72 B: see i would have gone to see it

77.02 77.34 B: yeah 

77.58 77.91 B: i 

77.58 78.12 A: oh okay 

78.30 79.30 B: yeah i had um 

80.22 82.42 B: visited their website a couple of times and they had a 

82.85 84.25 B: contest on there that they were giving away 

85.99 86.60 A: oh wow 

88.24 89.01 B: to having to do with 

95.83 96.28 B: (( )) 

96.82 97.14 B: um 

97.41 98.90 B: it is something i would want to see 

99.61 99.96 A: yeah 

100.49 105.89 B: i mean it would be good like a saturday afternoon movie when you are sitting back watching nothing you know having nothing to do at home and 

106.30 107.49 B: get really enthralled into it 

108.22 108.62 B: at home 

110.74 113.99 A: i really think the last time that i was trying to think of the last time i went to a movie 

114.42 116.57 A: was probably when dr. seuss came out or 

118.71 121.45 A: um the christmas one oh gosh now i can't even remember the name 

121.92 123.03 A: the grinch stole christmas 

124.52 125.12 A: the grinch 

125.91 127.27 A: so that's been you know (( )) 

125.93 126.28 B: how many 

130.53 130.83 A: but 

131.55 135.70 A: it's hard because you know with time and with kids and 

136.00 139.28 A: when i get into a movie then i wonder where they are if they aren't with us -cause they are 

139.39 139.90 A: teenagers 

140.77 141.19 A: you know 

141.57 142.75 B: would they want to see movies 

143.37 147.33 B: being teenagers would they want to see a movie like that is it is it too young for them 

146.66 152.01 A: no they didn't want to see it so you know but i wonder where they are you know what they are into 

154.24 161.84 A: i have this thing about where where i need to know where they are 

157.32 158.87 B: christmas movies itself that 

173.05 173.43 A: uh-huh 

206.99 207.82 B: complicated because 

208.99 211.14 B: one might be playing at the same time the other one was 

219.24 221.16 B: so i have a box of 

221.34 223.66 B: probably over twenty five tapes that i did that year 

224.08 224.89 A: um we have uh 

224.12 224.57 B: of all these 

224.68 224.99 B: christmas 

225.85 228.45 A: we have probably about twenty tapes 

228.80 231.38 A: that we did the same thing with but that was a few years ago 

232.21 235.37 A: and we got all the cartoon ones all the movie ones 

236.02 236.48 A: you know 

236.02 236.61 B: for christmas 

236.59 236.88 A: and 

236.97 241.81 A: and the scrooge you know that's been played you know twelve different ways so we have all of those 

241.45 242.65 B: oh yeah absolutely 

242.32 243.29 A: you know 

243.21 244.56 B: miracle on thirty fourth street 

244.69 245.20 A: yes 

245.42 246.36 B: yeah that that's 

246.33 248.00 A: the three of those and 

246.47 246.90 B: that one 

247.57 252.65 B: yeah that one is my all time favorite yeah and now every year do they play the original when you try to watch them 

253.37 256.49 B: and like you are saying with the scrooge um that one um 

257.16 260.02 B: it is the same thing when you got to watch it you've got to at least see the original one 

260.91 264.29 B: and uh sometimes they they play all the other versions but they don't play 

264.62 265.27 B: that 

265.42 267.78 B: and with my my cable service i've got you know 

269.37 270.60 B: probably like three or four hundred 

270.80 274.04 B: channels so i've got uh you know a big choice to watch all these various ones 

274.41 275.13 A: oh yeah 

275.54 276.15 B: but um 

276.94 278.89 B: last last year unfortunately i was going through 

282.74 283.48 B: that would be a good re- 

286.17 286.60 A: it is 

286.82 287.32 A: at at 

294.47 295.82 B: (( )) isn't going to be there anymore 

296.45 297.13 A: yeah that too 

298.43 299.02 B: but um 

299.23 300.77 B: there there's been several um 

301.17 303.69 B: new movies that have come out that look really interesting 

304.20 309.13 B: um there is one that i actually had i i'm not even sure if the (( )) is still good at the moment dreamcatcher 

312.92 314.13 A: is that the one by kevin k- 

314.40 314.73 A: (( )) 

315.13 316.04 A: -ten stephen king 

316.38 318.44 B: i'm not sure it sounds like a stephen king movie 

318.83 321.80 A: yeah i i saw that and i'm thinking yeah that one looked good 

322.03 324.14 A: and then chicago kind of sounds good too because 

325.19 325.60 A: i don't know 

326.09 327.31 A: i guess -cause i like richard gere 

328.80 329.21 A: you know 

328.86 330.36 B: chicago i mean that 

331.80 333.58 B: a musical isn't really my 

334.81 335.13 A: no 

334.93 336.36 B: but with queen latifah 

336.46 337.95 B: and the part that she played in this 

338.45 340.61 B: and the trailers that i have seen for that i'd like 

341.45 341.79 A: yes 

341.86 345.03 B: that i think i would be really interested in seeing it for for that part of it 

345.79 346.05 A: well 

346.68 348.26 A: uh and when they had um 

349.06 352.28 A: richard gere and they were talking about him learning to tap dance i kind of thought 

352.61 354.42 A: that might be kind of funny to see too 

354.57 356.31 B: i didn't even know that richard gere was in this movie 

360.56 361.40 B: i had no idea 

363.01 364.49 B: i had no idea 

365.18 365.51 B: but 

365.29 369.47 A: but otherwise right now i don't think there is a lot that i want to see maybe there is a couple that i wouldn't mind but 

370.01 372.66 B: w- what is the what is the um i can't think of it right now what is the um 

373.17 375.25 B: the movie that we know him for officer and a gentleman 

376.33 376.94 A: oh 

376.43 377.68 B: the r- the richard gere movie 

378.16 378.68 A: yes 

378.95 379.37 A: classic 

378.99 379.28 B: yeah 

379.75 382.22 B: yeah i think i i don't know how many times i've seen that movie 

382.50 382.79 A: yeah 

383.64 383.98 B: (( and )) that was 

383.81 387.28 A: see see and my problem is i like movies like that but my husband doesn't 

388.11 389.36 A: and he likes 

390.38 393.70 A: some comedies but he likes more of the sci-fi type things so 

393.94 395.89 A: in that respect too it is really hard to 

396.25 397.93 A: get out to the movies to see 

398.38 400.49 A: something that we'll both really enjoy 

402.68 404.11 A: and so it is almost better 

405.55 406.10 A: renting them 

407.72 409.92 B: well at least you've got somebody to drag with you 

411.01 412.24 B: i've got um 

412.45 413.10 B: i don't have 

414.87 417.86 B: but i don't have a regular person to drag with me to the movies 

418.04 420.26 B: but even even with my friends 

420.37 421.20 B: the fact of 

421.62 423.71 B: even when i i get um movies passes 

424.44 425.34 B: um and i 

426.15 430.65 B: often i get an e. mail from somebody i have no idea -cause i don't work in the industry and i have no idea you know 

431.03 432.21 B: somehow i get on somebody's list 

432.86 433.79 B: they say here you know 

433.96 438.81 B: uh this movie is going to be coming out you can go see the movie you know the day before it comes out you know um here is your pass 

444.55 447.44 B: i you know i'm even at the point calling these friends of mine 

448.58 448.85 B: free 

449.23 449.54 B: you know 

449.99 450.65 B: free movie pass 

450.87 451.76 B: lets go and 

452.16 452.80 B: sorry i can't go 

453.33 461.32 B: or i can't go and i i'm trying to give it to somebody so they can go to use it so i always find that pretty surprising and i think it probably has a lot to do with 

457.57 458.00 A: wow 

462.00 463.21 B: where i live because there is 

463.96 467.51 B: there's so many options of things that can be done and there's more 

467.72 474.64 B: there's uh more things to do then one one has time for and i think people take advantage of (( )) you know take um advantage of 

474.83 481.46 B: a free movie pass today oh you can always go to the movie next week you know it's always going to be there or you can go to this or you can go to that or you can do this instead 

482.27 483.28 B: so i think for 

483.58 485.48 B: where i'm at people don't um 

486.70 488.28 B: really get excited over something like that 

488.97 494.23 B: like i i think it would be more like people in small towns a free movie pass oh my god we have to get out of the house lets go 

489.06 489.42 A: right 

496.25 499.51 B: i think i think maybe if i said you get free popcorn and free drinks i think 

500.73 501.50 B: (( )) would rather go 

501.70 503.22 B: then knowing the movie itself was free 

503.67 503.96 A: yeah 

503.80 504.83 B: which i don't really understand 

505.98 507.19 A: well maybe because the price isn't 

509.34 511.01 B: that the popcorn is more expensive
