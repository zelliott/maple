12.03 12.85 B: hiring 

13.05 13.57 B: um 

14.04 15.37 B: do you have any solid 

15.63 16.59 B: feelings about that 

17.22 17.87 A: um 

18.33 20.33 A: no not really i'm not sure 

20.92 21.89 B: yeah it j- 

22.23 22.91 B: you know 

23.36 24.54 B: to me it seems 

24.80 25.48 B: um 

26.72 28.66 B: that there are pros and cons in 

28.76 30.34 B: no matter what happens 

30.74 32.06 B: somebody is going to get 

32.33 32.84 B: um 

33.04 33.70 B: left out 

34.14 34.57 A: right 

34.96 35.59 B: and uh 

38.20 39.74 A: i don't know 

39.16 40.69 B: it's it's a very 

40.09 41.41 A: it sure does leave us open 

41.57 41.92 B: huh 

42.13 44.48 A: it's the question sure did leave this very open 

44.72 45.50 B: yeah it did 

45.70 47.64 B: it did you know um 

48.81 51.05 B: i i know without affirmative action 

51.19 54.09 B: a lot of people would never have gotten in to the jobs 

54.26 55.95 A: definitely i think so too 

55.32 55.67 B: um 

56.63 57.35 B: i uh ah 

57.66 59.19 B: and i and in the past 

59.61 62.31 B: it seems to me that affirmative action is really 

62.86 64.29 B: really very important 

64.57 64.93 A: right 

65.41 66.82 B: that i don't know if it's 

66.98 69.19 B: as important now as it used to be 

70.03 71.07 A: i don't know i think it 

71.32 73.15 A: things vary know i think it's um 

73.70 75.12 A: things are more equal now 

75.43 75.88 B: mhm 

76.47 80.79 A: i guess with what it seems you don't see it in the news so much with all of the inequality 

81.02 82.13 A: so much as you used to 

84.07 84.61 A: i don't know 

85.05 85.81 B: yeah 

86.58 88.61 B: yeah it it (( yeah )) 

88.74 96.33 B: i think i much would have rather had the topic i missed earlier in the week when i didn't have my pin number which was on time travel 

95.97 97.95 A: you know that is exactly what happened to me 

98.74 100.42 A: exact same problem 

100.55 102.40 B: you didn't have your pin either 

102.27 102.67 A: nope 

102.96 103.41 B: oh 

103.04 104.11 A: so i had to call them and 

104.42 104.71 A: like 

104.94 106.87 A: twelve messages on my answering machine later 

107.92 108.51 B: yeah i went 

108.12 108.70 A: i have it now 

108.99 111.20 B: i went back in and had to um 

111.33 115.49 B: renew my subscription and they called me with my pin again 

115.43 116.75 A: yeah 

117.18 119.79 B: but the topic is affirmative action 

119.20 119.68 A: right 

119.98 121.62 B: darn 

121.38 122.02 A: yeah i know 

122.24 122.84 A: oh well 

123.03 123.67 B: yeah 

124.09 125.16 B: well you know some people 

125.28 126.30 B: some areas 

126.42 127.81 B: i think um 

128.43 129.49 B: it is important 

129.97 131.48 B: i mean you look at our politics 

131.70 136.12 B: (( and )) our politicians most of them are still fight 

133.08 133.47 A: right 

136.26 137.62 B: older men 

137.91 138.25 A: right 

138.48 145.67 B: and uh even corporations have what they call the cl- the glass ceiling where women could only go so high in the business 

145.99 146.46 A: right 

146.51 147.26 B: and then that's 

147.40 147.81 B: it 

149.25 149.60 B: but 

149.28 151.90 A: and that's not fair but if they're not qualified 

152.60 153.66 A: do the same job 

153.90 155.95 A: it's not fair that they get it because they are women 

156.16 156.61 A: either 

156.42 157.02 B: yeah 

157.18 157.93 B: yeah i 

157.66 158.00 A: right 

158.20 159.63 B: i- i- i- you know it's 

160.13 161.79 B: very complicated because 

162.34 162.75 B: you know 

162.97 164.39 B: if they are qualified 

165.06 166.11 B: and they don't get it 

166.30 167.83 B: then that's not fair but if they are 

168.03 169.69 B: aren't qualified and then they 

169.82 170.57 B: do get it 

170.75 172.08 A: then it's not fair to the man 

172.08 172.81 B: yeah 

173.07 173.42 A: so 

173.82 175.22 B: if there was some way they could 

175.34 177.24 B: do blind um 

177.60 178.20 B: you know 

178.45 181.01 B: interviews where you didn't see 

181.31 183.08 B: uh the person 

183.33 186.03 B: you just looked at you know their qualifications 

185.96 189.78 A: right and not their gender or ethnicity or anything like that 

189.91 192.26 B: yeah then that would that would be good but 

192.71 193.34 B: you know 

194.04 197.66 B: then it gets down in to those areas where um 

198.05 199.11 B: people 

199.46 205.86 B: are in jobs that actually you know require personality and that kind of thing how do you judge that 

204.89 205.20 A: right 

206.60 207.16 A: exactly 

208.52 211.11 B: it it's a complicated thing and it's also a very 

211.36 212.96 B: boring topic 

212.61 215.15 A: i know i don't know what else to say about it 

213.31 213.80 B: (( yeah )) 

215.06 216.75 B: i don't either 

216.90 219.93 B: i don't know but we're we're supposed to talk for ten minutes 

219.99 222.05 A: i know about affirmative action 

222.18 223.62 B: did they say we had to 

223.74 225.32 B: stick to affirmative action 

225.39 226.17 A: i don't know 

228.70 231.59 A: wish there were more questions that we could answer so that it wouldn't be 

232.21 233.23 A: so open like that 

233.25 233.95 B: yeah 

233.42 233.85 A: oh well 

234.27 234.88 B: yeah 

236.19 243.11 B: ah uh ah you know it seems that we are kind of in agreement here affirmative action is is good when 

243.21 243.70 B: there are 

244.11 245.64 B: places where 

245.90 248.14 B: there's actual uh prejudice 

248.62 249.90 B: being involved that 

248.71 249.11 A: right 

250.33 252.82 A: definitely but it seems you know to me i'm not 

252.97 255.84 A: i don't hear about it as much anymore it se- sounds like to me 

256.03 257.54 A: a lot of people are trying 

258.31 265.61 A: really hard to just go based on qualifications and what people are good at and bad at and things like that rather than 

265.00 265.38 B: mhm 

265.71 267.20 A: hi i'm woman or 

267.56 270.01 A: hi i'm black or something like that you know 

267.68 267.95 B: (( )) 

268.69 269.26 B: oh yeah 

270.16 270.66 B: yeah 

270.62 272.32 A: i'm not going by that so much anymore 

273.58 273.90 B: y- 

274.05 279.10 B: you know i know there are places where it's you know there still is discrimination 

279.17 280.05 A: definitely 

280.34 280.70 B: that 

281.82 284.48 B: y- y- you can't change things overnight 

284.90 285.29 A: right 

285.53 287.11 B: uh i think um 

287.53 289.93 B: the fact that there are um 

290.26 291.72 B: legal recourses to it now 

292.95 293.42 B: i think 

293.54 294.06 B: that and it- 

294.19 295.15 B: -self is 

295.39 296.28 B: um 

298.37 303.48 B: is probably just as good as actually having a an affirmative action kind of policy 

303.56 303.90 A: right 

303.72 305.94 B: i mean you have a policy where 

306.06 306.62 B: uh 

306.97 309.83 B: you choose the most qualified person and if there are 

310.22 312.19 B: equally qualified per- people 

312.87 314.88 B: and one happens to be of a different 

315.02 315.56 B: uh 

315.83 316.94 B: gender slash race 

317.68 318.92 B: and your company is 

319.14 321.58 B: has an inequity in gender and races 

321.93 323.66 B: then i can see where affirmative 

324.18 325.87 B: an affirmative choice would be good 

326.63 327.00 A: right 

327.15 327.68 A: definitely 

327.22 327.67 B: that it 

327.88 329.57 B: you know that you have to you know 

330.81 332.03 B: l- like all these 

332.30 333.37 B: the like the students 

333.54 337.12 B: that are not getting in to college now because of affirmative action action 

336.79 337.16 A: right 

337.60 340.42 B: they are more intelligent they have higher test scores 

340.70 342.64 B: and yet they are not allowed in and that's just 

343.08 343.88 B: that that's 

344.05 345.54 B: not right that's unfair 

345.84 347.39 A: no i don't think that is either 

349.11 349.42 B: and w- 

349.17 350.39 A: setting people out when 

350.51 350.78 A: they are 

351.37 353.95 A: just as good or better than other people isn't 

355.48 357.47 A: that makes me kind of upset 

356.80 357.20 B: yeah 

357.45 360.37 B: you know it it really does it me makes me upset to 

360.32 362.41 A: i mean uh your tax dollars go to pay for 

362.50 364.59 A: the education and the scholarships and 

365.01 371.07 A: uh the grants and things like that and donations to corporations that give scholarships and things like that and you don't want to 

371.41 372.69 A: give them your money and 

373.01 374.08 A: everything and then they just 

374.47 376.19 A: choose someone out of the blue and not 

376.82 380.50 A: the people with the highest test scores and the best qualifications or whatever 

380.68 381.18 B: yeah 

382.31 383.88 B: and it almost seems like they should be 

384.34 385.09 B: instead of 

385.25 388.00 B: affirmative action being something where 

388.27 388.77 B: you just 

389.62 392.75 B: hire somebody or admit somebody on the 

393.19 396.39 B: the basis of race or or gender 

396.71 397.15 B: um 

397.59 399.26 B: maybe affirmative action should 

399.56 401.43 B: concentrate more on 

401.57 403.48 B: raising those people 

403.70 404.12 B: up 

404.38 406.87 B: to where they actually have the qualifications 

406.97 407.44 A: right 

407.55 409.27 B: you know instead of giving them the job 

409.38 412.05 B: what about giving them the education somehow 

412.34 412.73 A: right 

412.86 417.16 B: uh but at the same time not uh discriminating against people who 

418.03 419.18 B: who actually really 

419.38 420.73 B: had the qualifications 

421.38 424.04 B: you know and face it they need the job as much as anybody else 

421.48 421.96 A: right 

425.02 426.74 B: just because you are a white male 

426.87 429.00 B: doesn't mean you don't need to go to work 

428.91 429.93 A: exactly 

430.39 430.94 B: yeah 

431.79 433.51 A: i agree 

434.05 435.95 A: well we agree on everything here 

436.19 437.32 B: yes we very agreeable 

436.89 437.42 A: it gives us 

437.79 440.13 A: nothing to talk about now 

439.11 440.50 B: no no 

441.94 442.24 A: but 

442.39 444.80 A: oh well maybe we'll get some better topics 

445.42 445.90 B: yeah 

446.03 449.00 B: yeah i was really mad about not getting the time travel though 

449.11 452.79 B: i was like -cause i was reading a book on time travel at the time 

453.06 454.68 A: oh and that would've been really great 

454.56 456.92 B: yeah i could've discussed the book left and right 

459.27 463.80 B: yeah when i when i signed up for it i didn't realize we were actually going to be talking to other people on the phone 

471.00 475.65 A: and then i started getting all these calls i didn't know my pin my answering machine was flooded 

475.86 476.34 B: uh-huh 

475.96 477.73 A: with phone calls from them and 

478.69 482.00 A: my husband laughed at me he thinks that's funny he is like guess who 

482.77 485.90 A: and every time uh they this number would call me 

486.25 486.79 A: um 

487.13 489.25 A: they couldn't find anyone else for a discussion group 

489.59 490.46 B: oh 

489.59 492.61 A: so i'm just sitting here waiting and waiting 

492.31 493.12 B: oh 

492.79 495.83 A: so it's kind of nice to talk to somebody 

494.56 498.70 B: yeah i i didn't realize i was going to be talking to somebody until this actual phone call 

498.89 499.63 A: wow 

499.33 501.09 B: and then when i realized that i went 

501.44 505.01 B: oh my goodness what if all those calls they were making to me prior 

505.76 509.88 B: were people just sitting on the other end waiting for somebody and 

510.02 511.85 B: they were hoping to talk to me
