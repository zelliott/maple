4.28 5.67 B: i'm good how are you 

5.53 6.96 A: i'm okay 

7.56 10.90 A: um so affirmative action that's our topic 

10.88 12.00 B: right 

13.22 17.51 A: well being a minority i think affirmative action is appropriate 

17.58 22.14 A: um because we got to get the system equally balanced don't you think 

22.38 24.47 B: yeah i totally agree 

26.13 27.10 A: um 

28.56 31.79 A: what objections when when would you feel an objection to it 

32.15 33.50 A: ah you feel though 

34.35 36.82 A: because my daughter she she goes to a college 

37.83 51.71 A: and um it's a predominantly black school or historically black school and so the whites go there as a minority so it works in favors everywhere a lot of people are saying it's it's just the blacks and hispanics i disagree i i see the difference now 

51.84 52.67 A: um 

52.88 56.15 A: i don't think we should do away with um affirmative action 

56.16 61.31 A: even though you use affirmative action you also also looking at the person's skills and knowledge don't you think 

61.31 62.41 B: yes 

63.19 64.14 B: um 

67.66 69.69 A: aha okay i i 

69.88 71.01 A: are you still there

72.01 74.40 A: (( oh okay you didn't say anything )) 

73.71 75.98 B: i'm sorry my phone's cutting out 

75.74 77.05 A: (( oh okay [laughter] )) 

76.79 77.66 B: (( [laughter] )) 

77.88 78.76 A: um 

79.52 85.41 A: there's a lot of laws that should come off of the books but can't come off of the books because we can't get it straight right 

85.96 87.17 B: yeah 

86.01 87.57 A: just at this time 

87.94 92.81 A: l- look at what's going on right now we shouldn't be in conflict with in another country 

92.96 97.17 A: but until everybody's equal you have to have things like that in place 

97.43 98.67 B: exactly 

98.63 100.93 A: mhm now where are you from 

101.24 103.44 B: i'm from dallas

110.84 111.90 B: yeah 

110.96 112.40 A: where we are 

112.76 123.07 A: and it it's really helped my children because my children are adults and it it's just so po- that their o- their outlook is so much more positive than mine 

123.25 132.47 A: because i grew up in the south when there were segregation and things like that and my my parents didn't make a lot of money they couldn't get the good jobs 

123.72 124.55 B: (( yeah )) 

133.15 138.33 A: but now it's it's mandatory to give a person an equal shot at everything 

133.41 134.30 B: yeah 

138.79 139.71 B: (( yeah )) 

138.97 141.69 A: and we're al- we're also retired military 

141.74 146.06 A: we couldn't have gotten the things we received now without that affir- affirmative action 

146.30 148.25 B: right definitely 

148.11 149.07 A: (( mhm )) 

149.74 152.90 B: and see i'm in college also so i've you know

168.92 172.24 B: blacks minorities hispanics you know everything 

172.59 180.31 A: i got a question for you you know when you're filling out a job application and they ask for demographics and they say it's optional do you fill that part out 

181.56 183.33 A: (( when they're trying to keep track )) 

181.74 182.58 B: (( ah ))

185.61 194.54 A: i know we we find it hard to want to fill it out as well i know what they're trying to do to keep count and to see if there's really a need for these services 

194.97 199.12 A: but y- you should be hired on the basis of your qualifications

255.87 257.38 A: and if we didn't have 

257.47 260.49 A: services like you know affirmative action in place 

261.11 265.00 A: a lot of people wouldn't be able to get into schools or or 

264.06 265.03 B: yeah 

265.20 266.46 A: in in the 

266.55 273.83 A: doorway of a office building because of the color of their skin or male male or female things like that 

274.12 275.13 B: (( yeah mm )) 

274.12 278.44 A: women will never catch up with the pace of a a white male you know that 

278.59 280.51 B: right correct never 

280.66 285.22 A: di- did you hear on television the other day they were talking about scales pay scales 

285.24 289.46 A: the average white male with a bachelors degree i think they said made something like 

289.59 292.15 A: sixty thousand dollars just right off the bat 

292.07 293.10 B: mhm 

292.41 296.93 A: but a black male made forty percent of that with the same qualifications 

297.15 305.32 A: um no no no a wo- a woman made forty percent of that a white women made forty percent of that a black male was even less than that forty percent 

305.42 306.64 B: really 

306.62 308.27 A: that's ridiculous [noise] 

307.96 309.37 B: that is 

309.87 311.05 B: yeah and um 

311.07 313.88 B: what i i want to be a police officer 

313.88 315.05 A: oh okay 

314.74 318.93 B: so i mean that's a predominantly male field 

318.50 320.16 A: yes yes 

319.40 321.10 B: and i mean it's going to it's 

321.86 325.66 B: i mean everybody's like you don't want to do that you're a girl and it's like you know 

325.95 328.83 B: just because i'm a girl doesn't mean i can't do that 

328.67 331.16 A: question then would you fight 

331.41 332.32 A: um 

332.55 334.25 A: a war for your country 

334.80 336.60 B: would i definitely 

336.49 344.05 A: oh i'm glad to hear that because with affirmative action we still won't put women in combat you know that right we 

342.91 344.10 B: no i didn't 

344.17 351.46 A: um we will not put them in hand to hand combat we let them fly planes we let them go on ships but they cannot go into 

351.55 358.53 A: combat as of yet and i think we need to work on that i i the military's one of the last 

360.18 361.50 A: die hard 

361.68 363.47 A: groups i guess they just 

363.55 366.94 A: find it hard to rewrite those laws and and change things d- 

367.08 368.32 B: yeah 

368.17 374.18 A: do you know you ah being in the military if you have an extramarital affair they can just um fire you 

374.30 375.84 A: dismiss you out of the service 

375.74 377.27 B: an extra what 

377.17 378.94 A: ah an affair 

379.57 380.78 B: oh really 

379.76 380.48 A: they can 

380.49 381.99 A: fire you for adultery 

382.34 386.17 A: i mean there's laws on the books you wouldn't believe you can't curse in front of women 

386.61 389.69 A: they don't reinforce that one which they need to 

389.93 392.92 A: but that's that's what i mean by affirmative action 

393.58 396.41 A: the laws don't keep up with time 

393.67 394.59 B: (( yeah )) 

396.68 401.89 A: and and that's wrong that's why we can't be equal at in everything we say and do 

402.25 403.91 B: mhm 

402.36 405.79 A: so we've got to have affirmative action on that aspect of it 

406.24 407.33 B: right 

407.19 409.18 A: now is this your first phone call with them 

409.09 410.32 B: yes [laughter] 

410.09 411.89 A: (( okay )) 

411.97 414.20 A: [laughter] we're on number two [laughter] 

413.78 415.19 B: oh okay 

414.81 416.57 A: yeah so 

416.71 420.96 A: but i'm sitting here in kansas enjoying some beautiful weather right now 

421.41 422.64 B: wow 

422.67 425.45 A: yeah i could say that was affirmative 

425.41 427.17 B: [laughter] yeah 

426.18 427.39 A: [laughter] 

427.63 428.86 A: how's your weather 

429.13 431.84 B: um it's about sixty degrees 

431.79 433.69 A: oh that's not bad at all 

433.57 436.20 B: no it's pretty nice outside actually 

436.15 439.46 A: yeah [noise] n- now you said you were from texas right 

439.35 440.08 B: uh-huh 

440.79 443.55 A: now what do you think about the death penalty then when you look at 

443.84 450.95 A: the disparity between the the um the blacks and whites and min- minorities on death row 

451.31 453.41 A: versus whites on death row 

454.53 455.29 A: [noise] 

455.19 457.51 B: i am all for the death penalty 

458.14 464.97 A: but d- do you know there's such a great disparity more blacks are committed put on death row than 

464.30 466.35 B: than whites are yes 

466.10 467.02 A: mhm 

466.93 469.07 B: i i don't think that's fair at all 

469.37 471.88 B: and i mean the um 

472.93 473.99 B: (( ah the )) 

474.38 479.26 B: ah like killers or people that are going to put on death row like murderers and stuff 

479.12 479.95 A: uh-huh 

479.51 480.20 B: um 

480.70 484.39 B: sixty percent of them are white males it should be you know 

484.27 485.43 A: (( yeah )) 

485.26 487.89 B: sixty percent of criminals are white males 

488.02 491.50 B: but you don't see sixty percent white males on death row 

492.12 495.01 A: you think you you've heard that it's sixty percent i 

495.01 498.50 B: yes it is six- it yes it is it's a 

495.11 496.83 A: (( didn't know it was that high )) 

498.19 499.26 A: so that's what's 

499.30 500.59 A: reported 

501.12 504.51 A: because i think blacks tend not to report 

505.41 507.93 A: domestic disputes and things like that 

505.45 506.45 B: yeah that's 

507.88 510.44 B: that's u._c._i. uniformed crime report 

510.55 511.74 A: oh okay 

511.66 514.60 B: so yeah that's in my criminal justice books [laughter] 

514.63 518.05 A: oh okay now see i'm a social worker [laughter] 

517.68 519.25 B: oh yeah 

518.62 522.85 A: yeah and that's a good fact to know i didn't know that 

522.85 524.26 B: yeah 

524.17 529.38 A: but see al- also when you're looking at affirmative action more whites are able to get 

529.48 531.57 A: legal representation 

531.89 532.71 A: um 

533.19 534.11 A: (( than )) 

534.14 535.45 A: ah minorities 

536.35 537.30 B: yes 

536.65 539.04 A: because it's very expensive 

538.95 540.03 B: mhm 

539.41 542.47 A: so maybe we maybe we should have ah 

543.27 544.78 A: things like um 

545.81 548.18 A: um our our legal services 

548.20 553.81 A: at a set rate so everyone could get a fair shot at it the trial 

551.92 553.04 B: right or 

554.23 555.32 B: right 

555.68 557.29 A: now i got another question 

557.82 562.66 A: [noise] have you actually ridden with the police yet or are you just going through your courses 

562.79 565.33 B: no yeah i've ridden four times 

565.51 568.44 A: okay do they tend to um 

568.53 573.33 A: single out a certain group certain type certain car or anything to 

573.98 577.01 A: you know to stop more or to look at harder 

577.95 578.95 B: um 

579.01 582.25 B: not really usually we just run the license plates 

582.33 583.22 A: uh-huh 

583.49 586.69 B: just to see what's going on or if they look suspicious 

586.97 591.72 B: then yeah we're going to pull them over no matter what you know what car or anything like that 

591.77 596.47 A: in the d._c. area blacks are pulled over at a rate i think like four to one 

597.19 598.45 B: wow 

597.55 599.89 A: and and that's ridiculous it really
