15.70 16.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

17.44 18.67 B: what about you 

18.37 21.29 A: i i don't think so either 

21.71 23.27 A: yeah i mean 

24.29 27.14 A: and especially now i mean if maybe 

27.71 33.99 A: you had some sort of disagreement or argument or something [laughter] then maybe the would be different but um a 

36.27 38.54 A: million dollars [laughter] 

37.86 48.99 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah i friends friends are are hard to come by it seems like [mn] any more because everybody goes different directions 

38.86 40.05 A: [laughter] 

48.87 50.36 A: yeah 

48.99 54.71 B: and when you have a a good friend i just don't think there is any amount of money 

54.80 57.68 B: that could uh just throw that friendship away 

58.23 59.77 A: no not really 

60.01 68.76 B: you know they're uh they're there for ya whether you're having a good time or a bad time and [laughter] money eventually will run out 

68.61 70.31 A: this is true [laughter] 

69.61 72.87 B: and [laughter] then what are you gonna have you're not gonna have your friend or your money 

72.74 75.06 A: right 

74.46 79.54 B: i [mn] and besides it's it's pretty lonesome spending money 

79.73 81.28 B: without your friend 

80.40 83.50 A: (( without uh yeah without your [laughter] friend this is not )) 

81.48 82.54 B: [laughter] 

83.51 90.50 A: where i expected the the theme to go when the topic i heard [laughter] came up i thought maybe you'd be you'd get the money but then 

91.22 94.58 A: wow [laughter] [laughter] they threw in that condition 

92.25 93.98 B: yeah yeah 

94.53 97.28 B: yeah that's that's pretty interesting 

97.55 105.94 B: i and it's probably there's a lot of people out there that would take the money and kiss off their good friends 

106.48 109.99 A: (( yeah i don't know that )) 

109.98 115.71 B: people are you know people people are are going at a fast pace now it seems 

110.03 111.89 A: that's kinda sad [laughter] 

115.03 116.86 A: yeah 

115.89 118.80 B: and you know what's 

118.92 128.04 B: what's this friend if i've got a million dollars i can a lot of 'em i mean people think you know i don't need that friend i can just go buy some new friends 

128.34 137.64 A: yeah uh i don't know [laughter] 'cause the people you meet after you have money may only be associating with you because you have the money and 

137.75 140.14 A: (( the people that were with you before are with you you )) 

137.77 138.69 B: yeah 

140.38 141.28 A: know 

140.65 141.63 B: yeah 

141.84 143.58 A: (( just 'cause [laughter] )) 

142.95 152.44 B: [laughter] yeah i have i have a a couple of really good friends and there's just there's no way i'd tell 'em goodbye there's just no way 

151.23 152.22 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

152.37 154.74 A: can't talk to you any more i got the money 

154.14 157.09 B: yeah how oh boy 

157.42 158.19 B: that's 

158.53 162.16 B: that's just pretty awful [laughter] i think [laughter] 

160.46 161.49 A: yeah 

162.50 165.15 A: i hope they wouldn't say the same for me [laughter] 

164.46 171.45 B: yeah [laughter] yeah exactly that's yeah i don't think so i a couple of my friends 

171.95 175.34 B: uh my my really truly close friends 

175.88 177.90 B: i do- they wouldn't take the money 

178.07 180.16 A: mhm 

179.55 185.11 B: maybe acquaintances would but close you know true close friends wouldn't uh 

181.56 182.50 A: right 

185.64 187.52 B: wouldn't that's just uh 

185.95 187.11 A: yeah 

188.15 190.41 B: now my kids on the other hand 

189.80 191.74 A: [laughter] 

190.53 192.18 B: [laughter] 

192.19 197.06 B: [laughter] if it was take the money or take the kids i'd take the money 

196.68 198.30 A: [laughter] 

197.33 202.24 B: the kids can go find another mum somewhere down the road [laughter] 

199.93 201.90 A: [laughter] 

202.49 203.78 B: [laughter] 

203.14 204.09 A: (( oh )) 

203.87 215.06 B: that'd be a way i could get rid of 'em in fact [laughter] that's awful shame on me [laughter] [laughter] oh dear that's uh 

205.93 207.31 A: [laughter] 

210.30 211.52 A: [laughter] 

215.70 218.00 B: yeah so what would you do with your money 

218.20 221.29 A: well if i did take the money i uh [laughter] 

220.56 222.95 B: [laughter] 

222.20 229.26 A: i i don't know i probably wouldn't go and spend it all in one shot or anything because 

229.37 233.44 A: being a student you know i always incur a lot of costs and uh 

233.70 235.55 A: bills come my way so 

235.56 236.69 B: mhm 

236.12 242.42 A: i'd probably just parcel it out and save the rest i don't know i really 

240.87 242.94 B: pay all your student loans off 

242.99 244.58 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

243.60 245.09 B: [laughter] 

244.79 247.72 A: that would take care of a lot of that right away [laughter] 

247.05 253.22 B: you know that's i mean that's that's interesting that here you are in a position to 

253.66 255.72 B: actually use the money 

255.70 256.94 A: yeah 

256.34 259.19 B: for the good of your you know schooling 

259.14 260.46 A: mhm 

259.80 261.72 B: and yet you choose 

261.92 263.95 B: to take your friend instead 

264.22 265.33 A: yeah 

264.74 267.34 B: that's that's cool that's cool 

266.76 270.07 A: well presumably the friend would last longer [laughter] 

269.12 271.22 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

270.52 273.06 A: and do more good in the long run [laughter] 

272.36 274.66 B: yeah that that's true 

274.12 276.59 A: yeah money comes and goes 

275.13 275.94 B: uh 

276.72 280.65 B: it does and good friends 

281.08 282.99 B: come but they shouldn't go 

282.51 285.57 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

285.01 289.19 B: i've ha- i've had some really good friends that turned around and 

289.62 291.60 B: stabbed me in the back but 

291.56 292.71 A: yeah that's 

292.06 292.95 B: (( you know )) 

293.28 296.42 B: you still h- hope that the ones you have now 

296.52 298.95 B: are going to be life long friends 

299.28 300.61 A: (( yeah )) 

300.33 304.45 B: do you have any friends that you like grew up with you know through 

304.47 307.35 B: junior high and high school that you're still friends with 

307.45 309.76 A: oh absolutely yeah i 

308.63 309.74 B: do you really 

309.80 312.99 A: i uh hang out with a lot of my old high school friends 

313.17 314.30 B: how old are you 

314.40 315.67 A: i'm twenty two 

315.75 317.38 B: okay well you're still 

317.44 318.55 B: you're still 

317.74 320.35 A: yeah well it's not that far back so [laughter]

320.75 322.18 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

322.82 324.91 A: oh yeah but

332.85 334.04 A: mhm 

333.43 334.64 B: um 

335.08 338.94 B: but i mean it's like we're in a different world 

339.31 342.49 B: you know they live in their world and i don't 

342.55 344.57 B: i don't even belong there 

344.41 345.66 A: right 

345.42 348.78 B: i i mean we haven't talked since high school 

349.38 351.14 A: mhm 

350.54 352.06 B: long time ago [laughter] in 

351.81 354.01 A: mhm that that's really 

352.47 353.38 B: fact i 

353.78 368.32 B: i found out my my very best girlfriend every year she'd write my mother at christmas and say i'm gonna i'm gonna call at on her birthday i'm gonna call on her birthday and this year i said well i'm gonna be home on my birthday maybe she'll call and we found out that she died 

368.52 370.38 A: oh wow 

368.69 370.10 B: and it was like 

370.36 373.87 B: oh my gosh we never got to connect 

373.78 375.87 A: yeah 

375.30 386.54 B: you know and and i mean we lived together we breathed together you know we went on vacations together we were the closest of i mean we were like sisters 

381.76 382.87 A: yeah 

383.33 384.26 A: mhm 

386.61 387.72 B: and 

386.73 387.68 A: yeah 

388.04 391.33 B: after thirty years or whatever it was 

391.57 394.23 B: there isn't any any other chance 

394.20 395.70 A: mhm 

395.08 396.97 B: and that's sad 

396.97 397.96 A: yeah it is 

397.89 405.84 B: you move away from where you grew up or where you you know [mn] all your best friends were and lose touch 

406.15 407.37 A: (( yeah )) 

406.79 408.13 B: and that's too bad 

408.03 417.43 A: yeah it's kinda interesting that you said that because i [mn] i never thought about it at the time 'cause i was thinking of the the here and now with my best friends [laughter] and um i actually moved 

414.60 415.61 B: mhm 

418.02 429.97 A: out to the west coast from alabama where i grew up uh my first like eleven years and so you know i established good friends there and you know these were people when i was you know younger i thought 

430.09 432.91 A: um you know i'd have these people in my life forever 

432.58 433.64 B: mhm 

433.27 439.93 A: but having moved out here and it's only been eleven years ten eleven years i haven't spoken to them in 

440.43 449.28 A: yeah basically that entire time we you know we wrote each other once in a while in like the first year or so but you know i have no idea about them or 

442.64 443.45 B: right 

448.76 449.72 B: mhm 

449.73 453.91 A: anything and actually another friend of mine 

454.21 458.74 A: actually you know as recently as high school um i haven't talked to him 

458.80 463.99 A: since well i do talk to him now and again but it's not the same kind of relationship as it was 

464.33 465.25 B: mhm 

464.38 467.13 A: while we were still in high school we were a lot closer back then 

466.94 467.93 B: mhm 

468.42 477.82 A: so that's that's kinda interesting thing about like who i'm visualizing as you know my quote best friend now but then maybe five years down the line 

468.52 469.31 B: and your 

477.56 478.79 B: exactly 

478.65 480.75 A: it might be totally different 

480.18 481.36 B: exactly 

481.19 483.62 A: so now [laughter] 

482.62 494.38 B: [laughter] [mn] yeah [laughter] yeah well i i have i have three really really close friends that 

483.74 486.31 A: that money sounded pretty good [laughter] 

495.24 501.24 B: would probably do just about anything if i needed if i needed something they would be there 

500.54 502.30 A: right mhm 

501.58 506.41 B: uh one is a husband and wife and another is a a kid that i work with 

506.67 509.49 B: he's thirty seven and uh 

508.48 509.38 A: mhm 

510.25 515.20 B: you know i i travel all over the country with him we do shows and uh 

513.83 515.19 A: mhm 

515.61 516.60 B: i 

516.77 522.14 B: if i needed something i think he would be there if at all possible to help 

520.19 521.12 A: mhm 

522.35 523.60 A: mhm 

522.99 533.29 B: you know but [mn] the rest of the people that i've worked with for twenty two years i just got laid off my my girlfriend and i got laid off and uh those people 

530.85 531.81 A: mhm 

533.87 536.80 B: nothing i mean i've worked with 'em for twenty two years 

536.91 541.98 B: and there is absolutely nothing nobody's called to say how're ya doing 

536.97 537.93 A: right 

539.66 540.51 A: yeah 

541.91 543.28 A: mhm 

542.65 555.43 B: 'course i haven't called them to say ha ha i [laughter] don't work here any more [laughter] [laughter] but uh you'd think that after twenty two years of working with the same group of people 

546.05 548.53 A: (( [laughter] )) 

555.41 556.63 A: yeah 

556.04 558.30 B: that you would keep in touch 

558.28 559.51 A: (( absolutely )) 

558.53 559.09 B: (( [mn] )) 

559.24 560.40 B: but we don't 

560.50 562.02 B: we don't we it's 

560.82 561.86 A: yeah 

562.13 567.11 B: you know i mean they they were work friends and then you have off work friends 

566.64 568.70 A: right right 

568.18 570.12 B: and the work friends are 

570.88 576.16 B: bullshitters [laughter] super you know they're just they're in their own little world 

572.34 573.44 A: [laughter] 

576.55 577.53 B: um 

577.83 590.53 B: most of 'em were younger than the rest of us i mean they they laid off all of us old people that had been there for twenty three years and kept the young group and um 

585.14 586.40 A: oh 

587.84 589.07 A: (( oh no )) 

590.64 592.80 B: i don't know it's just it's a different

594.76 595.90 A: right 

596.07 597.93 B: and i'm better off 

598.60 599.95 B: (( without having ))
