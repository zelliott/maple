24.03 25.22 A: yeah 

25.33 26.26 B: (( um )) 

26.64 30.52 B: i think it needs to be equal no matter what you're talking about [mn] 

30.32 33.24 A: yeah i think so too i i guess um 

33.83 35.31 A: i guess i'm a little 

35.42 39.93 A: i don't know i sometimes i think it's a good thing and and sometimes i i just think it's not 

40.01 42.81 A: such a great idea and so 

42.71 44.74 B: depends on how people use it 

44.43 46.44 A: that's true that's true 

46.01 49.45 B: if they use it to their advantage then it's not very good 

49.20 53.33 A: yeah where um what part of the country are you from 

53.19 55.48 B: um tampa florida 

55.05 62.13 A: yeah i was going to say that probably has a um a you know probably depends a little bit on on what you think about it so

64.82 68.58 A: and so yeah yeah i think i think it can be a 

68.65 73.30 A: a beneficial thing but i think it a lot of times in the corporate world it can be used the wrong way 

73.79 79.36 B: yeah i i would imagine that being in a big city would make a difference 

78.91 80.74 A: yeah i think so too 

80.53 81.39 B: um

95.03 96.01 B: um 

96.93 103.05 B: you know they always have to advertise equal opportunity all that kind of stuff and it seemed like it was like that pretty well 

100.23 101.62 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

103.34 105.06 A: [noise] [noise] i'm sorry what'd you say 

104.74 106.30 B: it seemed like it was 

106.58 108.99 B: pretty good there where i was working 

108.82 110.22 A: yeah 

109.57 110.65 B: and um 

110.79 111.52 B: so 

110.80 112.87 A: when you worked in the medical profession 

112.81 116.29 B: actually i worked in a um community college center 

115.45 116.48 A: oh okay 

116.51 118.96 B: i'm ju- medically i'm just not able to work 

118.55 119.59 A: really 

119.32 120.92 B: yeah 

119.84 121.80 A: how long did you work there for 

122.09 123.89 B: oh gosh um

127.59 128.48 A: neat 

129.12 130.13 B: (( yup um )) 

130.40 134.29 B: so i've never really had to deal with affirmative action on a personal basis 

133.75 138.33 A: yeah i know i've i haven't either i've i've been um ah 

134.75 135.67 B: i know 

138.84 143.23 A: worked just a a little bit out a college and now i'm i'm staying home with my baby so 

143.29 145.30 A: um it doesn't really um 

145.53 149.73 A: i don't really see see that much of it either where i from my stand point 

150.07 150.86 A: (( so )) 

150.43 151.98 B: i heard your 

152.34 154.40 B: um baby in the background i think 

153.58 154.50 A: yeah 

154.58 159.25 A: she's hungry [laughter] i was feeding her a little bit so 

155.83 157.22 B: [laughter] whoops 

159.31 162.55 A: yeah but yeah i don't know um 

163.36 164.37 A: i guess 

164.75 179.21 A: i don't know like i said i i kind of agree with some of the some of things on it but you know for the most part i think i think it can definitely be a bad thing and and it stops a lot of people from getting to the point where they need to be the people that have worked hard and so 

177.51 178.51 B: mhm 

179.47 182.13 B: i'm sure on the other hand it's helped a lot of people too though 

181.79 185.01 A: that's true too yeah i i definitely agree with that and i 

184.22 185.03 B: um 

185.15 187.21 A: especially people that can't 

187.26 188.18 A: um 

188.28 189.29 A: can't get in 

189.34 191.66 A: you know some place otherwise um it helps 

192.05 196.72 B: [mn] yeah like maybe people that have a foot in the door or something like that 

196.04 198.21 A: yeah yeah exactly 

198.41 202.48 B: [mn] if they're qualified for a position i think it's you know 

202.67 204.76 B: the best thing that can happen it's it's 

204.21 206.44 A: yeah i agree i agree 

208.24 211.29 B: i don't know i i think there's good and bad for everything 

211.08 213.41 A: yeah yep same here 

214.24 216.13 A: this is actually a pretty hard topic 

215.98 219.11 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] i don't know that much about it [laughter] 

216.27 217.83 A: [laughter] 

218.64 222.03 A: yeah i knew i know a little as well i guess 

222.47 223.79 A: i mean i guess 

224.32 228.99 A: just in the in in general in the business world it's um 

229.72 234.03 A: i guess just a just a whole promoting somebody based on color race 

234.24 237.41 A: without qualifications isn- isn't a good thing but 

237.47 238.49 A: (( i don't know )) 

239.04 242.54 A: [laughter] this is it's kind of a tough topic to yeah to talk about so 

242.97 244.09 A: (( yeah )) 

243.73 245.32 B: (( [laughter] maybe that's why they chose it )) 

244.97 250.04 A: maybe so [laughter] so how many years did you you said you worked fifteen years at the community college

293.78 294.93 A: (( oh really )) 

294.69 297.34 B: i have many students that can testify to that yeah 

296.79 302.17 A: [laughter] so you're actually a professor in the in the college oh neat 

300.61 301.68 B: yeah

304.87 305.78 A: uh-huh 

306.50 308.02 B: because before that 

308.43 310.01 B: i had to get my degree 

309.88 310.72 A: uh-huh 

310.27 311.62 B: but i tutored maths 

312.97 318.05 A: and you probably would have tutored somebody like me because i'm not good in math [laughter] 

312.99 313.80 B: um 

317.44 318.75 B: that's the fun of 

318.65 320.77 A: i bet [laughter] 

320.10 321.77 B: it i enjoy that part 

321.55 324.44 A: yeah well that's definitely my weakest subject so 

324.59 325.85 A: [laughter] 

325.42 326.90 B: it used to be mine 

326.74 327.75 A: really 

328.37 331.25 A: neat you just kept kept working at it 

330.93 335.95 B: yeah well for awhile i just abandoned every every hope of ever getting a degree 

335.68 336.54 A: uh-huh 

336.19 337.16 B: and then 

337.33 338.83 B: i guess through the course of 

339.19 344.39 B: finding out that if you don't have a degree you can't do anything i finally said okay i'm going to go back and do it 

343.93 344.76 A: uh-huh 

344.76 345.75 B: and when 

345.84 346.75 B: i 

346.81 354.41 B: put the energy into it and went and sought help from people who could help me and stuff like that instead of like giving up 

354.65 356.19 B: then i was um 

357.29 359.69 B: able to make it through it 

359.26 360.16 A: uh-huh 

360.07 364.85 B: but um i'm not a math whiz or anything like that don't think that 

364.53 365.71 A: really 

365.19 367.40 B: because i studied for eight or 

368.17 370.11 B: eight or nine hours every day 

369.71 370.92 A: oh wow 

370.53 371.93 B: to get the stuff [laughter] 

372.15 377.74 A: that's pretty intense i don't know if i could commit myself to to math [laughter] like that that's great 

378.51 379.57 A: (( neat )) 

379.78 380.59 B: um 

379.84 382.04 A: so you have two room mates named kathy 

381.64 382.62 B: yeah 

382.56 383.37 A: neat 

384.06 385.29 A: tha- that's cool 

386.24 389.23 A: well so do you have any other um ideas on affirmative action 

388.88 391.98 B: [mn] um i was trying to think of it um 

392.69 398.50 B: what i wonder if in affirmative action would be more important in a bigger corporation 

399.26 400.40 B: you know what i mean 

400.03 401.55 A: yeah 

401.16 405.37 B: um thinking of a smaller run business 

405.80 408.14 B: may not um need 

410.70 413.74 B: need it as much possibly unless um 

414.77 418.31 B: i don't know like i think a family run business is 

418.36 422.18 B: like everybody in the family does it or almost everybody in the family does it but 

420.15 421.32 A: mhm 

422.49 426.32 B: larger corporation- larger corporations that have 

427.15 428.00 B: um 

428.92 432.28 B: businesses in different cities and 

432.37 433.91 B: all that kind of stuff 

432.71 433.96 A: [noise] 

434.28 439.76 B: i'm just thinking that they may need it it really may be really important for businesses like that 

439.61 443.93 A: they probably yeah because they would probably overlook um some of the 

444.06 449.17 A: um some of the good qualities in people i guess i could see where a small business they would 

449.27 452.00 A: they see it first hand probably so you know 

452.04 454.98 B: yeah that's what kind of what i was thinking um 

454.25 455.46 A: yeah 

455.72 457.33 B: i don't know um 

458.30 459.57 B: (( because there's like )) 

460.70 463.59 B: if you think about it in smaller business 

464.21 466.66 B: um the community college setting 

466.69 468.16 B: is smaller 

467.89 469.25 A: mhm 

468.32 470.11 B: but it's 

470.36 474.35 B: it's still the one i was in [mn] it's smaller than a university i mean 

474.84 479.10 B: it was still big because it was in two different cities 

478.07 478.93 A: uh-huh 

479.29 481.87 B: and i know that 

482.00 484.53 B: the president was based in one city 

485.26 487.56 B: and um president's college 

487.77 491.41 B: and there was a satellite campus in another city 

488.46 489.05 A: (( uh-huh )) 

491.06 491.87 A: (( mhm )) 

491.75 494.57 B: and he really wasn't over at the other campus 

494.82 498.71 B: so he wouldn't know the people over there but yet he was also in charge of hiring 

498.68 499.81 A: (( oh really )) 

499.49 502.46 B: um he always had a say in who got hired 

502.06 502.91 A: uh-huh 

503.06 505.36 B: so i was thinking affirmative action 

505.40 506.80 B: wasn't there 

506.95 510.34 B: he may think well i don't need her or him or 

510.70 513.73 B: or something like that that make sense 

511.82 515.19 A: that's true yeah yeah that definitely makes sense 

517.14 517.98 A: yeah 

518.35 523.44 A: i i guess it all just goes back to yeah if they're you know if they're not really involved in the 

523.58 529.69 A: with the hiring process i mean if they're involved in the hiring process but not as involved with the day to day 

529.48 531.27 B: (( um yeah )) 

529.99 530.81 A: um 

530.97 532.74 A: tasks and so forth 

532.97 535.60 A: yeah i guess that that is pretty important 

535.50 537.81 B: i think you said that better than i could 

537.41 539.49 A: [laughter] well i don't know about that 

540.59 541.74 B: [laughter] 

541.25 542.47 A: (( i don't know )) 

541.92 543.11 B: (( [cough] [cough] )) 

543.35 544.55 B: excuse me 

544.17 546.89 A: (( yeah well that makes sense yeah definitely uh-huh )) 

546.98 550.63 B: and i think about um like those big 

551.12 555.66 B: companies like horizon or oil companies or gas companies or 

556.08 561.42 B: like they have places all over don't they have it all over the world or something like that 

560.82 562.24 A: mhm i think so 

562.24 566.64 B: can you imagine if they just based people on who they like 

566.83 569.48 A: that's true if they just hired um white males 

569.72 574.33 A: [mn] that look that look nice [laughter] that's true 

569.85 570.92 B: [laughter] 

572.62 573.83 B: yeah 

574.83 575.72 B: or 

576.92 581.82 B: yeah or depending on who who was doing the hiring what they'd prefer 

580.63 581.42 A: yeah 

582.24 584.34 A: yeah that's true actually 

584.53 585.64 B: (( because i mean )) 

584.59 585.34 A: (( definitely )) 

586.05 589.29 B: what in the fifties or sixties it was usually a white male 

589.07 590.07 A: uh-huh 

590.40 591.17 B: but 

591.55 595.17 B: the other thing i think of is as long as they don't take it to the other extreme 

595.29 596.98 B: like hire only 

597.10 599.82 B: minority people and ignore
