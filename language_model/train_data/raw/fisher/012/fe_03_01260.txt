461.94 462.90 A: (( [mn] )) 

469.30 470.67 A: yeah 

470.04 481.93 B: oh yeah okay because i mean the thing is they i guess they tell you like to list times when you're going to be home and you know you kind of don't really know what your schedule's like this coming week 

480.38 484.95 A: yeah because i figured they called last night and i wasn't home the first two times 

482.87 488.87 B: right exactly exactly it's like well you know i can't just be waiting by the phone for two hours [laughter] 

486.53 487.33 A: (( no no )) 

487.88 498.94 A: but it also came along so i wasn't sitting here [laughter] [laughter] but they ca- they called again at like ten o'clock or a little before and i got put on hold endless hold 

489.09 490.26 B: right 

490.45 493.25 B: correct right exactly that's that's my thinking 

493.99 495.04 B: yeah 

495.43 497.31 B: yeah yeah 

498.85 500.01 B: oh really 

498.98 501.64 A: they kept playing music saying we're looking for a partner 

501.30 508.12 B: oh see that wouldn't work for me yeah yeah [laughter] they're not going to put me on hold but um 

502.61 505.15 A: and i finally just hung up and i said to heck with that 

508.17 515.64 B: no i i just i've been missing i get you know on the answering machine i get it every every night and i'm just like oh you know [laughter] what can you do 

514.20 514.84 A: [laughter] 

515.00 517.32 A: [laughter] if they're interested they'll call back 

516.55 524.32 B: that's right so so anyway they tell you like on their answering machine or whatever like what the day's conversation was 

519.43 520.03 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

524.16 529.15 B: and this is definitely the one that probably you can have the least to go on 

528.98 542.39 B: like i think yesterday was affirmative action and like the the day before that was like public schools and it was like all these controversial things it's like movies like yeah they're good movies are good you know 

540.63 542.01 A: oh yeah 

542.14 543.16 A: yeah 

542.43 543.31 B: [laughter] 

543.49 548.22 A: nothing like talking contro- controversial with a stranger [laughter] 

546.15 547.61 B: yeah that's 

547.63 557.75 B: that's true well you know you can't really you know you can't really do anything because you're not going to see them talk to him again so [laughter] you could get him real mad [laughter] it doesn't matter [laughter] um yeah i don't know 

548.52 550.04 A: [laughter] 

550.76 551.32 A: (( [mn] )) 

553.09 554.34 A: that's true 

557.72 559.95 A: did you ever see um life of a house 

560.27 561.97 B: no never seen that 

561.38 562.91 A: that's kind of interesting 

562.67 567.19 B: all right i'm going to develop a list of people's favorite movies 

564.96 568.30 A: [laughter] do you ever see blessed 

568.18 569.54 B: yes i saw blessed 

569.03 570.26 A: wasn't that cool 

570.00 571.95 B: that was a good movie yeah 

571.15 573.50 A: it it was really 

573.63 575.04 A: (( eye opening )) 

574.73 576.65 B: yeah yeah i 

575.60 578.37 A: for it to be a true story's what really caught my attention 

578.01 583.89 B: but you know like for in terms of like drug movies though i definitely think traffic was is amazing 

583.13 585.14 A: i have not seen that 

584.03 587.09 B: (( oh you have to see traffic if you like than yeah )) 

586.19 588.31 A: is it is it based on a true story too 

588.04 599.89 B: um somewhat i mean i- it definitely has a lot of basis in reality um but there's a i mean it's like a fictional story but it's got a lot of like you know all the politics and kind of like the the way the drugs are 

595.70 596.70 A: mhm
