0.54 2.75 B: hi this is paul who's this 

2.79 5.97 A: hi this is p._j. how are you paul 

5.84 7.35 B: doing okay how are you 

7.29 9.98 A: okay this is quite a topic 

9.75 12.65 B: yeah it's kinda kind of bizarre 

13.24 17.53 A: [laughter] well would ya take the million 

16.05 17.29 B: (( uh i'd have )) 

17.59 22.84 B: i'd have to say no i have money you know money is tight and money is important but uh 

23.25 26.20 B: i just can't give up a good friend for it 

26.37 28.21 A: i totally agree 

28.97 31.14 A: totally agree but it's tempting 

31.27 33.40 A: a million dollars 

32.86 36.44 B: yeah i did have to think about it for a minute or two [laughter] 

35.88 40.13 A: [laughter] so 

38.78 49.70 B: 'cause uh i don't know about you but i'm i'm sure that [mn] most people have you know that that what if scenario running in their head what if i did have a lot of money or could get a lot of money easily 

47.58 48.56 A: mhm 

50.00 54.51 B: but uh i think that this one's priced just a little too high for me 

54.13 59.22 A: yeah well you know i'd have to say my best friend 

59.43 62.39 A: number one is my mother number two 

62.41 64.45 A: is my youngest daughter 

64.42 65.78 B: yeah 

65.17 71.22 A: and so i'd be giving up a family member on top of it you know it's just not worth it 

71.71 73.04 B: (( yeah i agree with you )) 

73.50 74.09 B: (( [sigh] )) 

73.97 76.63 A: so who's your best friend 

75.78 83.07 B: uh it's uh uh right now it's a guy that i met here at uh school he and i have been working together and doing stuff together for about four years 

84.44 89.34 B: we uh work on projects together play games together stuff like that 

88.89 90.09 A: that's cool 

90.85 91.99 A: that's cool 

94.18 95.58 A: well you know 

96.41 100.36 A: i think you'd probably have to stop and think is there a way around it 

100.38 103.55 A: you can't talk to your best friend ever again but 

103.70 105.92 A: how are they ever gonna prove it 

105.66 109.58 B: (( [laughter] hey but what about email [laughter] )) 

108.59 119.88 A: [laughter] [laughter] exactly what about the changing of identity [laughter] so i mean what would they what would they do if you spent the money and 

121.00 122.03 A: then 

121.80 122.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

122.07 126.73 A: reconnected with your friend if they found out later what would they do about it 

126.01 133.92 B: yeah that's true i didn't really think about it that far into the theoretical i just thought about the actual you know philosophy type choice as opposed to uh 

133.97 139.57 B: if it if it take if it ever really did happen i'd probably come up with some interesting way of trying to get around things 

139.99 142.62 B: i can never play by anybody else's rules you know 

140.01 140.99 A: yeah 

143.51 146.69 B: gotta gotta see if you can find the holes in 'em 

146.31 157.20 A: right one thing about a hypothetical situation is is just that hypothetical you really don't know what you'd do until you're faced with it 

157.41 161.02 B: yeah and a lot of times it's because some of the important details are missing 

161.52 162.48 A: right 

162.63 163.57 A: right 

164.00 167.98 A: that it depends on the dire straits that you're in at the time 

167.87 169.09 B: yeah that too 

170.39 174.65 B: [mn] maybe in a year or two i'll change my answer [laughter] 

173.93 176.26 A: [laughter] 

176.95 179.45 A: well this is really a weird subject 

181.18 187.02 A: it's it's so much of a yeah i would or no i wouldn't and hard to talk about i think [mn] 

186.44 188.40 B: yeah 

189.20 190.26 B: i agree 

191.83 194.52 A: well we have to talk about it for ten minutes 

194.25 195.44 B: ten minutes 

195.34 196.94 A: ten minutes 

196.74 197.68 B: oops 

197.82 199.58 A: yeah 

198.80 203.39 B: well i'm saying oops because none of my other calls lasted nearly that long 

203.60 208.35 A: oh really you don't get paid you don't get paid unless you talk ten minutes 

204.64 205.80 B: yeah 

207.98 210.83 B: where does it say that i missed that part 

210.71 211.99 A: oh really 

212.39 219.14 A: when you signed up for it it tells you you must talk the whole ten minutes to get paid 

219.03 220.44 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

220.61 224.94 B: that'll teach me to do things without reading them very carefully [mn] 

224.38 233.54 A: you don't read ah ha [laughter] i always read the small the smi- the i'm sorry i always read the small print 

227.70 228.64 B: (( stupid )) 

233.06 247.80 B: oh i u- i do the thing is i signed up for this over a month and a half ago and so much has happened between now and then you know i and i signed up for a lot of different uh survey setups so i i wasn't sure which ones had which setups on 'em any more 

248.13 251.64 B: and i [mn] the only info i could find on the email was you know 

252.08 254.24 B: how to how the calls would work 

254.37 256.98 B: didn't didn't actually say anything about the parameters 

258.46 259.83 B: nope 

259.47 262.34 A: so you do a lot of surveys by mail huh 

262.04 266.71 B: yeah i i've uh found it's a good way to pick up spare cash in my free time 

267.24 275.04 A: i've been signing up but i tell you what all's i'm getting is a chance to win this or a chance to win that no cash really 

274.69 285.36 B: [noise] there's a site on the web where there's a site on the web somewhere that lists them all and you go through them and maybe one out of ten or maybe one out of twenty actually pays per survey 

276.29 278.37 A: (( not going into the right ones i guess )) 

285.59 286.74 A: i see 

287.15 289.93 A: you don't have to pay any money out to get on any of 'em 

289.65 293.85 B: none of the reputable ones i don't bother with the ones that try and try and scam ya 

294.04 295.03 A: right 

294.07 294.81 B: (( out of )) 

295.54 296.10 B: (( [mn] )) 

296.15 304.17 B: and as i told my mum when i was looking for this stuff if anybody asks you for an upfront fee for you to work for them it's a scam 

305.56 309.14 B: i mean [mn] it may not be but the odds are that it is 

311.16 314.35 A: okay back to the subject so if 

313.75 315.16 B: (( right [cough] )) 

314.53 318.85 A: you did take that how do you feel it would affect you 

319.78 321.19 A: in the long run 

321.01 328.79 B: in the long run actually probably not too much because i mean he's a- actually about to move away anyways we're both uh going our separate ways in a year or two 

328.97 330.11 B: so 

330.18 333.65 B: it would just mean parting about a year year and half earlier 

334.17 336.38 B: so in the long run it wouldn't affect me but 

334.26 335.28 A: mhm 

336.75 341.35 B: still you know never even to be able to just drop drop him a phone call you know 

342.39 343.36 B: (( i don't know )) 

344.14 352.43 B: again like i say it depends on the details the details are important and we you never get details in a hypothetical it's always so black and white 

351.79 352.92 A: mhm 

353.34 360.79 A: well i would think that maybe you couldn't talk to 'em personally but you could have a go between 

362.41 363.41 A: you know 

363.54 365.88 A: talk for ya back and forth 

366.35 368.63 A: then you wouldn't be breaking the rules 

368.40 370.46 B: yeah 

370.49 371.40 A: right 

371.72 379.89 B: hopefully 'cause i mean it depends again it depends on who's drawing this thing up 'cause you know if i was the one offering the million bucks you can bet i'd make it airtight 

381.12 383.88 B: no or no contact whatsoever 

386.09 389.10 A: well how is anybody gonna prove you contacted 'em though 

388.79 391.70 B: this is true but would you wanna take the risk 

394.28 395.36 A: well 

396.18 401.23 A: [cough] i would sign something and make it totally legit 

401.56 406.84 A: i will not contact 'em i will not personally contact 'em okay 

406.87 411.12 A: that's not to say i couldn't have someone else contact them for me 

410.87 413.55 B: yeah 

414.63 415.77 B: true enough 

416.12 419.29 A: and they didn't say that you couldn't um 

422.27 426.99 A: have a mutual friend that always talks to them 

428.29 431.86 A: send pictures and look at your friend's pictures 

433.41 434.93 A: that sort of thing 

435.80 439.58 A: it would depend i mean if it was a lifelong friend 

440.16 442.53 A: but i'm a lot older than you 

443.59 446.27 A: and friendships come and go 

447.16 452.70 A: i do not have a friendship from someone i went to school with 

453.15 454.15 B: (( yeah i've )) 

453.39 454.25 A: today 

454.24 461.11 B: i've been noticing that as as uh you move to a new place your your old friends kind of fade away and you you make new ones 

461.37 463.97 A: or you outgrow them or they outgrow you 

463.74 465.87 B: yeah 

464.99 469.88 A: your interests change i had one friend that i hadn't seen in uh 

470.64 472.73 A: probably about twenty years 

473.03 480.44 A: came back looked me up i mean we were really looking forward to seeing each other only to find out we had absolutely nothing in common 

481.44 482.40 A: nothing 

482.75 490.27 A: and it was kind of weird it was like the memory of what we had was better than 

490.82 493.75 A: actually getting together and being together again 

494.12 495.21 B: yeah 

494.60 503.40 A: o- only to find out we had grown so differently and and our morals and thinking and likes and dislikes and 

504.12 506.95 A: it it wasn't the same person any more 

507.98 511.33 A: you know so i might be tempted to take it 

512.51 514.67 A: it it really would depend 

518.91 521.03 A: then you could invest it 

521.23 522.93 A: and share it with them 

522.93 525.26 B: [laughter] that's true 

525.41 526.73 A: yeah 

526.11 532.55 B: i i'm sure that uh i- if the other person knew the details and i also wanted to split it with them they would have no hard feelings 

532.64 540.64 A: right exactly if you invested the whole thousand uh whole million dollars and never touched that million dollars 

540.73 546.37 A: and just lived off the interest that'd be a pretty nice chunk of change coming in every year 

546.14 547.65 B: (( yeah )) 

547.05 553.28 A: and you could split it with them you'd still have your original million and you're just splitting the interest 

556.31 558.27 A: and it would help both of you out 

558.11 560.08 B: yeah 

561.83 562.72 A: so 

563.84 565.79 A: how long have we been talking 

566.47 569.20 A: [laughter] 

569.87 573.96 A: i signed up for this thing they called me the first night on the wrong number 

574.15 575.33 A: and then 

575.57 580.16 A: i gave up on 'em i haven't heard anything from 'em for like almost two weeks 

580.52 582.66 A: (( so i didn't figure they were gonna call me )) 

584.99 585.73 B: oh 

586.41 593.13 B: yeah yeah i i'd almost given up hope too because you know a month had gone by and i'd heard nothing 

595.33 599.52 B: [noise] but uh yesterday night i started getting calls
