39.69 40.59 A: uh-huh 

40.54 45.73 B: but actually i i don't i'm not much of a news listener i am more of a 

46.12 47.72 B: radio listener 

47.42 48.33 A: uh-huh 

48.13 54.10 B: but i guess because of the war i started listening to t._v. news a little bit [laughter] what about you 

52.92 57.41 A: [laughter] well what when did when did you listen to the radio just driving around to 

56.07 59.15 B: oh when yeah when i commute to work

59.30 61.22 B: yeah what about 

60.27 62.36 A: (( um i h- )) 

62.94 64.05 A: (( [sigh] )) 

64.37 71.59 A: i have periods where i try to avoid current events that that because i think the current events are mostly 

71.61 73.67 A: negative and painful so 

73.40 74.71 B: yeah actually 

73.77 76.32 A: i will go through [laughter] a lot of a 

76.37 79.99 A: lot of times where i avoid the front 

80.13 92.11 A: section of the newspaper and i never listen to the news on t._v. but of course since we've entered the war i feel differently about it and i'm more compelled to find out about it but as i'm reading it 

86.74 87.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

92.31 98.95 A: i kinda wanna stop reading it i don't wanna know but i have been watching t._v. a little more and and um 

99.27 106.25 A: reading a little bit more but not a lot 'cause i just find it too overwhelming and stressful to know a lot 

105.63 112.15 B: especially the local news which is just um only murderers and crime or whatever 

111.62 112.91 A: right and 

112.14 124.92 B: actually that's the reason why i think i stopped um now that you brought it up i think that's the reason why i stopped listening to the news yeah it was uh yeah i mean i used to listen to it before and then it was just too depressing 

118.65 119.86 A: really 

124.30 125.59 A: yeah 

125.26 127.78 B: actually i used to get emotional [laughter] 

127.29 135.59 A: no you're right and yeah and that's right that is all they talk about whose house burned down and the people that are homeless or 

128.43 130.15 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

134.07 134.68 B: (( [noise] )) 

135.71 136.70 B: yeah 

135.72 137.99 A: as you said murders and 

137.35 143.16 B: yeah and even what little new international news you got was bad news only you never got good news 

142.67 143.37 A: right 

143.39 147.15 B: so it's like only bad things was happening in the u._s. and the world 

146.96 153.33 A: right and it seems i feel like i'm confronted with that enough on a daily basis without adding more but 

153.34 159.41 A: i do have to admit that sometimes i feel like i don't know what's going on because i um 

160.07 163.94 A: keep myself from getting involved with it so sometimes i feel 

165.20 166.40 A: i don't feel 

166.67 168.24 A: that knowledgeable 

166.89 170.54 B: informed yeah you aren't informed enough i guess 

169.86 171.58 A: yes exactly 

171.32 181.40 B: no actually the actually the only news i listen to is the financial news so if it's really bad or if it's really good i guess i'll hear about it in that news 

175.33 176.26 A: uh-huh 

180.42 182.55 A: [laughter] 

181.50 185.23 B: so it's not uh you know murder or anything like that 

184.60 189.14 A: uh-huh you mean you'll hear about the current events because the financial news is 

185.30 186.22 B: so 

188.93 191.02 B: affected one way or the other [laughter] 

190.14 191.25 A: yeah 

191.03 198.18 B: and actually my wife is the opposite of me she really loves to read the newspaper every morning yeah 

196.63 199.63 A: really she reads does she read the whole thing 

199.28 209.69 B: yeah she reads it uh cover to cover and she gets uh like depressed if there's no newspaper [laughter] she she not depressed but 

201.52 202.77 A: really 

206.75 210.59 A: oh she's she's like addict- addict- she's addicted to it 

209.94 214.02 B: news yeah she she feels like she's out of the loop kind of 

213.58 214.42 A: (( ha )) 

214.45 225.11 B: so and the funniest part is she comes back home and she tells me something and i know what's happening and she always gets mad at me because how do you know because she knows i never listen to the news [laughter] 

223.76 224.51 A: [laughter] 

224.78 228.72 A: you know which you know it's an amazing point is 

229.20 233.40 A: i i think you can spend so much time reading and 

234.24 237.61 A: somehow just by living here you get 

237.97 245.30 A: the highlights or the key points somehow if you you just happen to to be touched by the news somehow i don't know how but 

245.05 249.43 B: so and i guess if there's anything really important people at work will talk about it 

248.97 250.04 A: right 

249.45 254.56 B: you know if it's really major i mean if it's not major you know you're not gonna hear about it you're not missing anything 

254.51 258.57 A: so i guess i never thought about that but you really do hear about current events 

259.15 261.65 A: even if you don't yourself 

261.57 263.01 B: actively seek it 

262.43 268.96 A: yeah you still get it or people will bring it up or if we go out with friends they'll bring it up and yeah so 

264.14 264.81 B: (( yeah )) 

269.17 270.29 B: (( exactly )) 

269.78 270.62 A: [laughter] 

270.91 271.76 B: um 

272.50 276.92 A: and do you listen do you listen besides financial news do you listen to anything else 

276.67 277.45 B: no 

279.03 280.45 B: (( nothing else )) 

280.01 282.90 A: [noise] are you involved in finances is that your business 

282.73 292.66 B: uh no i guess i got into the stock market a couple of years ago [laughter] that whole boom and that's when i got really interested in it i guess i haven't lost that habit 

287.46 288.35 A: uh-huh 

292.24 294.11 A: oh that's good 

293.20 297.66 B: well i don't know if it's good [laughter] i'm not in the market any more but i guess 

297.21 310.13 A: well it's so funny because just before the phone rang my husband and i were talking because we just we fired a financial adviser that we were using um we fire- fired him a few months ago and we were just discussing 

306.24 307.10 B: oh 

310.24 311.32 A: whether 

311.44 313.27 A: or not um 

313.98 320.96 A: you know what to do 'cause we were at the time we were feeling like no one really knows what's gonna happen so we don't wanna pay somebody 

320.96 326.37 B: what when you mean financial adviser you mean it's like a uh your broker kind of thing or 

325.82 339.22 A: well he he was not a broker meaning he did not get paid to buy and sell for us but he did help us make investments and um would get paid based on how much money he made for us 

338.98 339.98 B: oh okay 

339.39 343.42 A: but of course we lost money like most people did and so 

342.04 343.25 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

343.83 348.08 A: [laughter] my husband was just h- his feeling was w- 

348.61 350.32 A: well why should we he 

350.33 355.17 A: you know why should we pay someone [laughter] we don't think any anybody knows what 

352.28 353.91 B: but you're not paying him right 

354.63 357.82 B: but you're not really paying him if you're not making money 

357.24 363.52 A: well we yeah you pay him a percent of what your portfolio is even if he loses money for you you still pay him 

359.28 360.22 B: oh your 

360.30 361.55 B: (( assets yeah )) 

362.34 366.51 B: okay so yeah so it's asset based on the assets yeah 

365.23 366.68 A: yeah so 

366.75 367.57 A: [sigh] 

367.87 369.11 B: (( assets are the money )) 

368.18 371.50 A: but we're not paying someone who i mean we could lose money on our own 

370.98 374.02 B: yeah you don't need to pay someone to lose it [laughter] 

371.58 381.58 A: [laughter] right and so you know we're we're we're still paying him a smaller dollar amount but at the same percentage of a smaller portfolio so when you think about 

378.76 379.48 B: (( it )) 

381.41 389.92 A: how much we we we looked at the figure that we paid him over i think we were using him for five years the figure that we paid him over five years was a lot of money 

389.52 392.17 B: was more than what you made in the five years i'm sure 

391.64 392.49 A: yeah 

392.23 395.95 B: yeah and net [laughter] i'm sure in the middle he made money yeah 

393.79 399.09 A: at this point yeah now you know who knows 'cause you never know i mean maybe if we stayed with him 

399.72 402.74 A: it things would come back y- you know you don't know 

402.35 405.20 B: yeah i just don't believe that anyone knows more than i do 

405.31 406.49 A: really 

405.38 410.34 B: yeah i mean not that i know a lot but it's just i think they're guessing as much as i'm guessing 

409.58 411.77 A: yeah that's ex- yeah 

411.20 413.64 B: since they are guessing i can guess it for cheaper 

412.64 414.11 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

414.45 418.13 A: right and at least you're totally responsible for yourself 

417.78 418.97 B: right 

418.38 420.46 A: you have no one to blame or no one to 

419.80 422.96 B: well it's better to have someone else to blame 

422.82 424.81 A: it's better when you have someone else 

422.97 423.82 B: [laughter] 

424.29 429.30 B: yeah yeah it's always better to blame someone than to blame yourself right you've gotta live with with yourself 

426.81 427.96 A: yeah 

429.13 431.67 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

430.95 432.06 B: but 

431.80 433.39 A: guess that's true 

434.28 437.39 A: so what got you interested in doing this study 

437.78 438.91 B: um 

439.34 444.26 B: i don't know my friend called me up and said they have this thing okay sounds good 

444.22 446.19 A: and do you live in the tampa area

448.72 449.56 A: oh 

449.78 453.57 A: oh i didn't know they were doing it all over 'cause i saw the ad um 

452.80 454.46 B: oh there was an ad 

453.94 459.52 A: i saw an ad in the newspaper in tampa i was down there visiting some friends and uh 

460.58 464.44 A: you know i told a couple of people about it and then i thought oh maybe i'll do it so 

463.70 465.85 B: (( oh [laughter] so where do you live )) 

465.58 467.32 A: i live in cleveland ohio

480.03 483.27 B: when did i come here about twenty nearly twenty years ago 

482.66 483.84 A: oh really

490.96 491.97 A: oh 

494.20 507.18 B: it's kind of uh you know you can never make friends uh you know i mean i mean it's the same with any country right it has nothing to do with india friends or anything like it's just to do with the friends you make when you're young because 

503.66 505.03 A: it's your childhood 

506.52 508.57 A: childhood friends i agree 

508.49 512.22 B: that's the only time you really have time to spend with them right to 

511.67 512.71 A: yeah 

512.23 518.74 B: really think about even now you make friends it's not going to be the same caliber as the one you made in college or in high school 

518.26 523.17 A: but i i think it's also there's something about the friends who know you 

523.20 535.22 A: and know your family and know you know were at your house growing up and stuff and they just know i think like the dynamics of your life and what you went through too i don't know it's something about knowing 

535.35 537.14 B: the whole set up 

536.09 541.39 A: the whole thing about you everything you were and you can talk about your family or they understand if 

541.48 542.28 B: right 

541.57 545.67 A: you have siblings how whether they were crazy or what they were [laughter] 

544.73 546.94 B: [laughter] yeah yeah 

546.04 549.29 A: whether they drove you crazy or whether you drove them crazy 

548.66 550.96 B: that's true yeah that's a good point yeah
