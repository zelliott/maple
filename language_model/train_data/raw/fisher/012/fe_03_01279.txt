501.50 502.77 A: it's disturbing 

503.36 505.45 B: yeah i i think that's 

505.50 510.01 B: kind of the test then i mean if we really believed that it was 

510.13 514.95 B: a one hundred percent just cause and worthwhile 

515.22 516.73 B: you know um 

516.90 518.74 B: i don't think there would be 

519.31 521.25 B: that much ambiguity 

520.69 521.74 A: right 

521.36 524.63 B: yeah i i'm very much against it

572.89 576.34 B: um about whether we should be fighting then 

576.64 578.56 B: i think there's your answer 

579.28 589.25 B: otherwise you know i i don't think you you want much question whether you know if you're gonna go to war and kill um it's mostly the civilians i'm 

583.32 584.78 A: right 

589.27 593.81 B: you know i i just the thought of you know somebody like me in iraq um
