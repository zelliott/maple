1.98 3.17 A: hi hello 

3.28 4.46 B: hello 

4.52 6.76 A: uh my name's jeff shaw 

7.50 9.19 B: i'm andrew lamdenebro 

9.08 9.95 A: okay 

10.33 11.51 A: (( what do you think )) 

11.71 13.25 B: well um 

14.46 19.54 B: i have to say it doesn't sound like all that much of an attractive author or offer 

19.56 23.65 A: you mean you would take uh you won't the million dollar offer 

23.72 25.32 B: i wouldn't no 

25.44 27.62 A: [laughter] well i would 

27.17 30.85 B: you would [laughter] well i guess it depends on who your best friend is 

27.82 28.58 A: yes 

31.19 35.79 A: yeah but um even if you cannot speak to each other you can still communicate 

35.83 36.96 B: well 

37.09 51.79 B: that is open to question i mean it's possible that you know you could just never talk to them and you if you were to send them a letter or if you were to tell a friend and they were to tell them then it might work out but on the other hand it might be against the agreement 

52.12 52.93 A: right 

53.13 54.95 B: you're right if if if it was 

55.45 59.09 B: um strictly about being 

57.94 59.99 A: not not communicating 

59.36 62.72 B: not yeah if it was strictly [mn] about not communicating then i would 

62.97 67.99 B: i couldn't possibly take it if it was you just couldn't talk to them that would be 

66.32 69.16 A: well making new friends is easy i think 

69.70 71.85 B: well yeah it is 

72.62 74.69 A: but keeping the old ones is not 

76.21 77.37 B: not certain 

77.24 82.08 A: i uh i don't know i i i i would do it 

81.61 82.56 B: [laughter] 

82.84 86.86 B: well um i mean it it certainly seems like a 

86.95 99.41 B: a potentially reasonable choice and if you didn't have for example any good friends you you know there is one person you you knew one person then it would be a very o- obvious choice to make 

98.98 104.54 A: [mn] well how about this if if the offer is uh like uh ten million dollars 

99.77 100.85 B: um 

106.49 109.11 A: then what's your action to that [laughter] 

109.81 112.99 B: well having a million dollars certainly would be nice 

112.65 114.47 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

113.36 114.29 B: (( [laughter] )) 

114.45 115.59 B: um 

115.89 124.60 B: there is i guess there there is from your question [mn] do you think that you could earn enough money um in ordinary 

125.60 127.17 B: (( in ordinary methods )) 

127.35 128.32 A: right 

127.71 128.86 B: to um 

130.15 135.64 B: to you know be satisfied or would that million dollars really make a difference i mean certainly if you were 

135.98 144.48 B: had you know no job and no chance of getting a job it would be a lot different than if you were a very rich lawyer or something 

143.71 145.33 A: yeah 

145.84 147.03 A: (( well i don't know )) 

150.32 151.17 B: (( um )) 

151.65 154.98 B: i guess certainly there have to be some people for who a million dollars is 

154.99 158.37 B: if not meaningless at least very insignificant 

156.87 165.28 A: well think of well think it think it of it uh this way if you win a lottery ticket today you might get twenty million dollars today 

165.42 168.09 A: (( and uh what would you do next you'll )) 

165.52 166.15 B: (( mm )) 

168.48 169.85 A: probably 

169.97 175.33 A: resign from your your job and uh get somewhere else to get uh 

176.51 179.90 A: get get on your life and uh never retur- be turned back 

179.65 189.37 B: mhm oh well that's certainly what you would want to do i suppose if you didn't like your job um i there was a are you familiar with the comic strip dilbert 

189.74 190.98 A: uh which one 

190.74 191.73 B: dilbert 

191.59 193.32 A: oh yeah i i know that 

192.72 202.85 B: they had they had one i remember i'm sorry i don't know when maybe it was in one of their books um where he won the l- where dilbert won the lottery and he went back to work anyway 

202.84 211.22 B: and he [mn] and [mn] and dogbert asked him why are you doing that and he said because work is the second b- best place to gloat after home 

210.15 211.51 A: (( mm [laughter] )) 

211.21 221.78 B: [laughter] and it actually it would be kinda nice to have a million dollars and still go into your work and say well i'm gonna be here but i don't actually intend to do anything i'm just gonna sit here and laugh at you all 

219.82 225.95 A: right right yeah right right you don't you you don't fear to be uh to be fired or anything 

225.40 226.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

226.57 228.94 B: does it mean anything to be fired all of a sudden 

228.51 229.64 A: right 

229.44 239.88 B: [mn] on the other hand uh if you if you consider this like winning the lottery i've been told and i can't actually confirm this but you know i haven't done the research myself or seen it 

239.70 246.84 B: you know in in print but i've been told that most lottery winners actually go bankrupt because they spend it all and 

244.40 250.96 A: right because it's easy money and uh they don't they don't see it as uh as the money they earned 

250.26 251.95 B: mhm 

251.32 253.85 A: right but uh 

252.45 253.59 B: (( so )) 

253.99 255.06 A: well 

255.14 264.17 A: [laughter] if i got the chance to win the lottery or get uh free one million dollars i would really think hard to uh not accepting it 

265.40 272.11 B: mhm well it certainly is hard to look at a million dollars um to just look at it and say i don't want it 

272.16 274.72 B: [mn] that's that's very difficult 

275.75 276.69 A: right 

276.07 283.22 B: um on the other hand you how much is it worth to yourself to be able to say that you did that i mean if you were 

282.27 284.98 A: well how much is your friendship worth 

285.62 288.53 B: well that's that's a rather difficult thing to figure out isn't it 

288.54 289.51 B: um 

288.62 290.41 A: right it's a uh 

290.75 291.84 A: (( it's a )) 

292.17 293.66 A: great opportunity [laughter] 

293.47 304.57 B: mhm well it it certainly i mean it it certainly could be the the case that your friendship is worth only nine hundred thousand dollars and so you are better off taking the deal 

304.40 305.36 A: right 

304.76 317.81 B: um but p- supposing your friends your your other friends or your new friends found out that you had totally cut adrift your very best friend in exchange for money i mean would they start wondering am i worth a nickel 

317.89 320.07 B: ten dollars what what is my value 

320.12 322.14 A: [laughter] well what if 

322.51 324.08 A: what if they never know 

324.45 326.26 B: mhm 

325.91 327.98 A: hide the truth from them 

327.22 331.18 B: it it it might make it harder to find to to get a new friend if you 

331.39 332.72 B: trade your old one 

332.68 333.86 A: right 

337.51 338.29 B: but 

338.30 338.92 B: (( um )) 

339.83 342.09 A: (( that's true do you have a very best )) 

340.25 343.43 B: i mean i guess what go go ahead i 

343.50 345.75 A: (( well no no you go ahead mhm what )) 

345.07 353.45 B: okay i didn't think i w- what i was i'm gonna say is is useful but [mn] i guess you could you could look at what you would do with a million dollars 

354.27 356.78 A: (( do you want to do if you win a million dollars )) 

357.07 358.31 B: (( what )) 

358.16 360.59 A: what what you want to do if you win a million dollars 

360.58 365.08 B: yeah i mean if if i happen to have a million dollars um 

365.31 369.77 B: i'm honestly not sure what i'd do i mean it's just been 

368.85 370.71 A: right [mn] buy a big house 

370.07 376.94 B: [laughter] well that would that would be certainly a nice option um it would sure make college a lot cheaper 

376.74 377.78 A: right 

377.59 389.31 B: um you could i could i'd probably end up you know giving some back to my parents and giving some to my sister so that she can go to college and things like that but i mean 

386.39 387.20 A: right 

390.62 400.83 B: [mn] when i when i look at it so many of the things that i buy are um they j- they waste away i mean you buy a a computer and it 

400.82 414.86 B: five years later it's worth nothing and two years after you buy it it's worth a do- a hundred dollars as compared to whatever you paid to begin with it it's not like the what what i'd like to buy is not exactly things that are 

409.54 410.55 A: (( right mhm )) 

415.13 417.76 B: um good good expenses 

418.25 421.76 B: so i should i should i should try to avoid them 

422.35 424.81 B: how 'bout you what would you be spending it on 

424.27 431.46 A: well i i would like to use the money uh for starting up a new company or something doing doing some business 

428.97 430.20 B: a new company 

431.46 435.34 B: what what would um what kind of company could this be 

435.38 442.88 A: well uh probably like a trading company or small manufacture uh specialty like manufacturing company 

440.33 441.69 B: some- something like 

442.27 444.40 B: like something like a day trading or 

444.30 449.16 A: no not exactly but uh more like uh uh trading goods company 

448.57 449.86 B: oh so 

449.27 452.22 A: bring goods from uh one one place to another 

452.12 453.11 B: um 

452.63 454.48 A: from one country to another 

453.33 455.88 B: in like im- import export or 

455.54 456.88 A: yeah more like that 

456.02 457.65 B: okay yeah okay that's 

457.74 459.68 B: well that certainly makes sense 

457.79 458.64 A: or 

459.34 461.90 A: right and uh then make more money [laughter] 

461.14 464.66 B: mhm well yeah more money [laughter] is always a [laughter] a good thing 

464.21 471.85 A: [laughter] right and uh if i [mn] get really rich and uh i can probably make the same offer to somebody else 

465.09 466.11 B: uh 

471.76 473.71 B: mhm 

472.54 477.48 A: right give them some one million dollars and uh make them happy [mn] 

478.92 480.10 B: yeah 

481.37 489.32 B: well it it's um certainly the case that if you have a million dollars it's a lot easier to get your second million 

491.21 492.90 A: right 

492.37 493.74 B: but um 

496.50 500.73 B: i guess how m- how m- how much money um 

501.12 508.51 B: w- what is there a different no- is there a different amount of money other than a million dollars that you could make this decision at 

508.79 509.95 A: uh 

511.65 513.08 A: well [laughter] 

513.53 514.92 A: (( this is uh )) 

515.12 516.31 A: (( well i don't know )) 

516.48 518.38 A: it's hard but uh 

518.83 521.80 A: if if it's more than uh 

522.06 527.45 A: what you can earn in a very in a a reasonable time then i would go i i would go for it 

528.05 529.97 B: mhm 

530.22 532.25 B: i mean um 

533.31 536.98 B: i i guess it seems to me that if they offered you say 

536.99 546.97 B: five hundred million dollars that's pro- probably more than than you i mean the thing is that that's more than you could spend well not entirely but it it it's pretty close and so 

539.33 541.08 A: (( well [laughter] i right )) 

545.75 546.56 A: (( right mhm )) 

546.99 557.81 B: you know for at that point you know the idea of you know starting the company well why bother you have you know you have enough money to do whatever whatever you want as it is 

557.87 560.93 B: um but on the other hand if they were to offer you say 

561.08 562.89 B: five thousand dollars 

562.97 571.50 B: then it's you know you could probably you could certainly even at even working at mcdonalds in over a summer you could probably make that much 

571.74 572.96 B: yeah so it's 

573.01 580.77 B: the there i i wonder if one million dollars is kind of a magic number or if it if it's really something that could be 

581.25 582.73 B: all over the place 

582.95 587.29 A: [laughter] well one one million dollars doesn't get you a 

587.48 593.19 A: a a good life after your after your retirement it's just getting getting you started 

590.91 592.04 B: well 

592.80 598.80 B: mhm a million dollars would certainly certainly help with your retirement be it tomorrow or 

599.15 599.89 B: thirty years
