121.81 122.53 A: yeah 

127.88 130.04 B: i would i would forsake my best friend 

130.27 135.06 B: for some cash cash is always welcome and could do lots of things but uh 

134.44 135.19 A: oh yeah 

135.74 136.37 B: but yeah 

136.72 138.57 A: but it's not worth that much 

138.10 140.59 B: that's not that's that's not a particularly good deal 

140.82 144.16 A: no no it's not i've always heard that money is neutral it's 

144.43 145.34 A: how people use it 

145.48 146.42 A: that makes a difference 

146.30 146.82 B: sure 

146.91 148.35 A: and that's not a good use of money 

148.64 149.04 B: right 

149.31 149.71 A: to 

150.13 151.33 A: kick out your best friend for 

150.22 150.55 B: right 

152.35 155.99 B: i've i've lots like we all have lots of things we could do with money but 

157.26 158.75 A: there's other was of getting it 

159.25 160.11 A: that are more honorable 

160.95 164.77 B: and you know i'm not i'm not fortu- uh fortunately i'm not in a 

165.45 168.41 B: position where is a matter of life and death for me i'm not 

169.42 170.85 B: on the street starving 

169.58 170.41 A: not that bad 

171.23 171.88 B: yeah 

171.32 171.63 A: yeah 

172.36 175.22 A: yeah well i'm not either i'm it's been a struggle we had 

175.38 176.55 A: seven children and 

176.77 181.73 A: my husband worked for a not for profit bible publishing organization and you know we were we were short but 

179.81 180.13 B: oh

188.34 188.78 A: yeah 

188.92 189.38 B: but 

190.11 191.45 B: but friends help us through it 

191.61 192.67 A: that's the point 

192.49 193.16 B: so yeah 

193.22 195.95 A: that's the point we money can't buy friends so 

195.84 196.20 B: right

197.47 200.25 B: money money can buy false friends or money can buy ah 

197.89 198.25 A: you know 

200.30 204.42 A: that's the trouble yeah money will often buy false friends but they're gone as soon as the money is gone 

202.80 203.25 B: yeah 

205.80 206.49 A: so yeah 

205.89 208.46 B: and they'll help they'll help you in lots of ways to get rid of the money too 

208.76 214.14 A: oh absolutely absolutely yeah as long as you've got the money they'll hang around like flies 

211.01 212.06 B: oh well 

214.63 216.43 A: but uh they won't help you much 

217.35 217.68 B: yeah 

217.83 224.05 B: well i guess we don't have since we're both in agreement we don't have a lot a long discussion about it i guess i don't know 

223.32 233.08 A: no no i i agree i you know as far as what to do with a million dollars now i could come up with a few things on that you know but uh but not to not to get rid of my friend 

229.54 230.16 B: right

280.19 282.08 A: she was a very special person to begin with 

283.18 283.79 B: and and 

284.93 285.74 B: that would be 

286.65 287.21 B: so 

287.52 290.47 B: so difficult to get over in any sense in any way 

290.60 290.97 A: yeah

308.37 308.94 A: pretty good 

309.04 313.83 A: sh- sh- she would not be a good person to be compared with because she was really a very special person to start with 

313.02 313.39 B: right 

313.50 314.61 B: how long had you known her 

315.30 316.24 A: oh since i was twelve

322.20 332.99 A: uh oh when we go to bible conferences you know they'd put us in the same hotel rooms and and i'd spend a week at her house and she'd spend a week at mine in the summers when we were teenagers and then i went up to chicago 

330.01 330.39 B: right 

333.60 337.24 A: from saint louise to work for a bible for this bible publishing organization 

338.14 340.22 A: after i graduated from high school and she 

340.54 342.43 A: came up and lived with me and worked for it too 

343.13 343.75 A: so we lived 

344.05 349.78 A: you know lived together shared an apartment together for two years as single girls and we both had boyfriends at the same time and 

345.78 346.20 B: yeah 

350.07 352.80 A: you know she got married ahead of me but then we 

350.75 351.12 B: right 

353.02 354.21 A: you know we had our children 

355.02 359.64 A: you know approximately at the same times and stuff as after i got married of course so 

357.93 358.22 B: yep 

359.85 360.68 A: yeah we were 

361.85 362.88 A: we were really close 

363.56 364.37 A: and uh 

365.17 365.51 A: you know 

366.73 370.80 A: she was just the kind of a quiet mousy little mousy girl in a way you know as far as 

371.32 374.48 A: her personality was concerned yeah and she was uh but 

371.36 372.37 B: just to look at her 

373.19 373.56 B: yeah 

374.88 377.90 A: she was just the kind of person that everybody always loved her you know it was 

378.69 379.95 A: she just didn't have any enemies 

380.63 382.83 A: but and that's why it was such a shock 

383.33 384.02 B: well of course 

383.46 386.33 A: when somebody murdered them but it was a jealous brother in law 

384.93 385.35 B: right 

387.34 390.85 A: he was a he was a drifter himself and and uh 

390.99 392.74 A: unbalanced uh mentally 

393.00 393.65 B: yeah 

393.21 394.00 A: and um 

394.56 394.88 A: her 

395.02 395.96 A: her sister had 

396.51 398.82 A: kind of been the black sheep of the family and married this guy and 

399.40 400.57 A: he got jealous because 

400.81 401.18 A: um 

401.49 406.12 A: my friend and her husband had were doing well and their lives were in order and their kids were good and 

405.76 406.19 B: right 

406.50 407.80 A: you know and he 

408.41 409.62 A: just decided to knock her off 

410.51 412.87 A: and knock them off and i'm not sure 

413.04 415.87 A: what his motive was other than just plain pure jealousy 

417.83 418.86 B: just insanity 

419.43 421.76 A: yeah really and he got by with it too 

420.52 421.14 B: yeah 

423.12 424.04 A: he actually got by with it 

424.93 425.51 A: but uh 

425.06 425.39 B: (( did uh )) 

425.91 426.84 B: i guess i mean 

427.20 428.61 B: i i trust he at least 

429.76 430.27 B: i don't know 

432.15 434.76 B: in jail or institutionalized or something or 

434.08 434.69 A: no 

434.84 436.42 A: no he wasn't the the police 

436.75 437.22 A: um 

439.16 442.25 A: the police didn't go after him even though you know and 

442.59 442.95 A: since 

443.07 444.67 A: there was absolutely no evidence 

444.92 445.33 B: oh 

445.03 448.02 A: left the the the person that did was very very 

448.13 448.56 A: conscious 

449.41 451.40 A: actually there was evidence that two of them had done it 

452.19 453.40 A: and we knew 

453.82 454.16 A: things 

454.76 455.06 A: that 

456.16 457.12 A: um you know 

458.04 459.05 A: the police should have found out 

459.96 460.35 A: you know 

460.67 464.35 A: but they they just took a completely direction different direction to to 

464.78 467.68 A: right from the start and just kind of wrote him off as not having full 

467.79 469.51 A: full deck of cards and 

469.82 470.41 A: and 

470.81 471.51 A: just ignored him 

472.18 475.71 A: and uh then they i don't know it was just really strange 

475.91 477.08 A: but he's still loose today 

479.07 480.81 A: and has admitted to doing it 

482.30 483.51 A: so it was really odd 

484.45 485.33 A: really really odd 

485.27 486.96 B: but hasn't admitted it to authorities 

487.00 487.80 A: oh no no 

488.54 489.07 A: no admitted 

489.24 491.95 A: somebody that couldn't prove that he ever said it you know 

494.48 495.03 A: but there was 

495.21 495.53 A: there was 

496.21 497.67 A: those of us that knew 

497.77 498.70 A: the situation 

500.23 500.75 A: um 

501.68 504.62 A: ev- everybody that r- that was really close and knew the situation was 

505.32 506.30 A: there was plenty of evidence 

506.46 507.13 A: pointing to him 

508.96 510.25 A: but anyway 

509.01 509.47 B: oh 

510.33 510.71 B: well 

511.01 511.47 A: (( )) 

511.47 512.37 B: sorry sorry that 

512.53 518.50 B: this suggested topic had to make you relive all of that again for for the umpteenth time 

516.48 518.96 A: well you know the the happy end is yeah yeah 

519.91 528.12 A: the happy end of the story is just that she's with the lord you know she knew that the lord is her savior and and so did the kids and you know they 

528.38 529.14 A: they're 

529.72 531.30 A: better off than we are right now 

531.20 533.70 B: and i hope i hope at least that you have uh 

534.87 536.19 B: new friends and 

536.52 536.99 A: oh yes 

537.27 537.54 A: yes 

537.69 540.15 A: we have we have friends and and uh 

541.45 542.00 A: just you know 

542.12 543.24 B: it's not the same 

542.19 543.92 A: how you miss people you love yeah 

543.64 544.03 B: right 

545.19 546.80 A: so 

547.06 548.05 A: so anyway but 

548.16 548.68 A: the 

549.95 552.06 A: that's the deal in that score 

552.75 553.73 B: well i i
