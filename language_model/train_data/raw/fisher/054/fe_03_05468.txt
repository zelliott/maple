0.00 1.69 A: hello 

1.28 2.58 B: hello 

2.47 4.45 A: hey my name's carlos how are you 

4.25 6.54 B: hi my name is charles i'm doing fine 

6.18 7.35 A: you're charles 

6.99 7.78 B: yes 

7.62 9.01 A: cool 

10.08 13.51 A: so how do you feel about smoking in public places 

13.47 25.73 B: so uh i mean as far as i'm concerned i mean they they can smoke in public places i mean as long as they got it separated 'cause some people don't really wanna smell the smoke persons like myself 

25.38 29.05 A: yeah i can agree with that i definitely don't wanna go 

29.13 38.67 A: to a restaurant and have the people next to me or even across the room smoking cigarettes just because it makes my meal that much more unpleasant 

37.93 40.44 B: right i mean as far as the uh 

40.27 46.29 B: as far as them smoking i mean it doesn't bother me as long as they don't intrude on my space 

46.12 56.97 B: i mean if that's what they chose to do with their life they can sit there and they can they can smoke and i mean it's just like alcohol i mean you can drink as long as it's not bothering anybody 

56.62 57.95 A: yeah i agree with you 

58.19 61.90 A: they can ruin their lungs and i couldn't really care less you know 

61.87 63.97 B: right i mean b- basically 

62.11 64.85 A: it's not my problem they're free to do what they want [laughter] 

64.48 73.48 B: right basically that's their choice i mean if they wanna go and they wanna smoke and they wanna basically get lung cancer or whatever 

74.21 76.58 B: that's basically on them i mean 

76.60 79.41 B: they they they they're grown adults i mean 

78.59 85.14 A: [noise] right i agree with you definitely i do i do however think that um 

82.57 83.50 B: so i don't 

86.23 94.85 A: when public places discourage smoking don't allow for it it deters people from smoking more you know what i'm saying 

95.45 99.29 B: well i don't i don't think it deters them i think they lose business 

99.45 100.96 A: they lose what 

100.25 104.19 B: i think they lo- i lo- i think they lose a lot of business that way 

104.11 105.11 A: right 

104.48 108.31 B: by putting uh a no smoking ban in their uh 

108.71 114.59 B: in in their uh business because a a lot of people smoke man 

114.53 125.35 A: right but if they chose to be a non smoking business that's one issue however if the city imposes the law or ordinance banning smoking in public places then 

125.75 128.74 A: they're not necessarily gonna lose business because 

128.83 130.95 A: the smokers can't go anywhere 

130.99 136.10 A: other than private locations so if they go to a public place then 

136.34 142.07 A: they they already know that all public places don't allow for smoking 

141.79 144.00 B: [noise] yeah but at the same time 

143.05 153.68 A: so i don't think that would since it's so universal i don't think that it would necessarily hurt business 'cause anywhere they would chose to go they'd encounter the same ban 

152.55 158.68 B: b- but uh i i also think if the uh if the city gonna impose a no no smoking ban 

158.76 162.90 B: in restaurants i also think that it imposes on people's rights 

163.30 164.55 A: the what 

163.88 173.32 B: i i think that it imposes on people's rights because they basically saying okay if you go out 'cause it's a public place you're not gonna be able to enjoy 

173.37 178.05 B: smoking [noise] and that's what chose to do that's their right i mean 

178.19 188.09 B: [noise] i i feel like they are they are basically imposing on on those smokers' right to smoke you know but 

186.41 190.07 A: well i wouldn't i wouldn't necessarily say that anybody has the right to smoke 

190.33 191.64 B: (( well i mean )) 

190.83 196.85 A: i mean you can't go to a school and smoke i mean there's certain places where it's very inappropriate 

195.81 200.21 B: well you can go to a school and smoke though i mean it's just they got smoking areas i 

201.80 202.82 B: mean 

203.50 208.34 B: that's that's just like if you found uh that i can't do this because 

209.20 218.23 B: uh because they don't want me to do it i don't think that they can say that necessarily is make a a a city wide ban i mean if you 

218.21 224.97 B: city imposes bans then they're they're pretty soon it's well it's no smoking anywhere 

224.80 226.32 A: right 

225.75 228.88 B: so basically i think they overstepping their boundaries when they 

228.75 241.25 B: when they saying no smoking in public in public places because the public place that can be that that can lead to any place actually public places are if you think about 

241.20 243.07 A: (( [noise] oh no i think they )) 

245.99 248.71 A: i think they actually refer to um [noise] 

249.34 252.08 A: not public places like parks or 

253.85 267.83 A: more like a business that you go into like a club or places like that i mean they all are included in public places but i think that parks and outdoor areas aren't aren't part of the ban necessarily [noise] 

267.47 276.54 B: it well no not right now it's not i mean it's it's like restaurants and like you said like restaurants and clubs and stuff but 

272.01 274.29 A: right exactly 

275.24 278.33 A: like indoor spaces indoor spaces 

276.63 284.74 B: right but who's to say if they can get away with this that they won't impose it throughout the city 

284.65 295.15 B: you know just trying to keep you all to smoke inside your homes i mean although that wouldn't even that wouldn't bother me neither 'cause i don't smoke but i just 

292.75 294.47 A: right 

294.98 301.45 B: you know i i think some- sometimes they're just imposing their will on on people that they shouldn't do 

302.00 308.39 B: i mean they gonna impose a no smoking ban why not impose a no alcohol ban well 

307.94 313.27 A: right i mean some places do some places ca- don't allow allow um 

313.35 318.64 A: sales of alcoholic products within their county and so forth 

318.46 320.50 B: (( that's true well )) 

320.78 328.21 A: but um i mean at le- i think most still allow people to drink their alcohol they can't regulate that as much 

329.15 333.42 B: no they can't regulate it because it's regulated by the federal government 

333.20 334.94 A: right 

333.74 344.48 B: whereas smoking i guess you can do it city to city i don't i mean it's no problem with it i mean i think it's i think sometimes they just overstep their boundaries i mean 

344.57 347.46 B: i can i can deal with no smoking i mean 

348.02 357.00 B: as i say i don't smoke so it really doesn't bother me but but i do have friends [noise] that does smoke and i i realize that they uh 

350.38 352.60 A: yeah exactly 

357.28 362.34 B: [noise] i realize that they don't wanna go no place where they just really can't be themselves 

362.23 363.83 A: true yeah i mean 

363.21 367.11 B: and and smoking makes them themselves 

366.86 368.55 A: right 

367.46 369.76 B: why not let 'em 

370.56 374.35 B: why not let 'em uh smoke so 

374.55 379.28 B: (( but as far as the school is concerned i can care less )) 

379.51 381.00 B: i mean schools 

381.02 386.48 B: schools they shouldn't be be allowed to smoke now see that's one pl- place that you shouldn't be allowed to smoke 

385.26 389.38 A: [noise] right i'm just say- yeah that's what i said that it was completely inappropriate you know 

389.62 390.76 B: (( what for )) 

389.82 391.79 A: regardless of the law 

391.53 394.77 B: right but but far as a a restaurant 

394.98 398.04 B: you know they should be able to go and uh 

398.25 404.15 B: smoke after they eat their eat a eat their dinner i mean if they gonna pay to go some place to eat 

404.49 408.11 B: i mean as long as they're not breaking any type of laws 

408.64 412.26 B: [noise] i don't see the reason why why the city would be so 

412.49 415.57 B: [noise] so adamant about them not smoking [noise] [noise] 

415.51 417.05 A: right i guess it's 

417.38 419.05 A: has to do more with 

419.55 424.86 A: the non smokers feeling like their their meals are being ruined 

425.08 435.74 B: well y- well yeah 'cause i i i know they said about the second hand smoke but my take on that that part of it is you know you gotta inhale a whole bunch of 

425.50 430.32 A: or compromised by people smoking close proximity 

435.92 438.26 B: [sigh] uh smoke to uh 

438.74 440.83 B: to really be affected 

440.22 449.92 A: yeah you really do i mean if you're only i agree if you're only putting up with that while you're going out to eat or doing these 

450.14 451.09 B: [noise] 

450.40 456.56 A: you know things that aren't necessarily constant then it shouldn't be a problem 

453.32 455.08 B: right 

455.90 462.01 B: right so i mean i think that's what all where the whole movement came from they found out that they can 

462.04 467.73 B: somehow get affected by second hand smoke and i think they just blew it out of proportion 

467.45 474.75 A: or i think they might use that information to further their cause against smoking you know they just add 

474.95 478.94 A: you know that much more fact to their argument well it's bad for us 

479.32 481.22 A: it's bad for everybody you know 

481.00 483.53 B: right but i i mean 

483.63 487.02 B: some at some point somebody's gonna to take a stand and say okay 

488.18 492.42 B: just because you know you you think that you've been overwhelmed by 

492.32 493.95 B: second hand smoke [noise] 

493.81 498.26 B: that you know you can't go around and treading on other people's rights 

498.04 511.20 B: and basically i mean i think it is a right for them to smoke i mean if that's what they chose especially in a restaurant or even a club i mean 'cause if they chose to go to their club that's 

511.27 516.99 B: they're allowing people to smoke well if you don't wanna smell the smoke you don't have to go to that club 

516.47 518.25 A: right 

517.82 518.80 B: so 

519.43 524.80 B: that then that's basically my take on the on the smoking issue i mean 

525.17 527.07 B: smoke is smoke 

526.85 530.67 A: hm and also we just had we have to put up with smoke 

530.89 534.36 A: so many in so many other places i mean you can't go 

534.43 542.60 A: you can't go driving in your car without inhaling exhaust from other cars i mean it's inevitable you can't avoid certain pollution 

539.31 540.19 B: (( right )) 

542.19 548.28 B: right i mean it's gonna be there i mean just like the little ban they they putting on they putting out a i 

548.37 554.84 B: think it's dealing with the uh with the cars i mean you like you say you got smoke coming out the cars i mean 

554.64 556.29 A: what's the difference right 

555.69 563.80 B: yeah what's the difference i mean y- you gonna have you gonna have those that smoke smoke is gonna be there regardless and people are always gonna break the law i mean 

563.86 568.41 B: they saying no smoking but who's gonna actually go out there and enforce it 

568.76 574.55 A: that's a p- that's a good point yeah i've never heard of any enforcement i've heard of the laws being made 

573.83 575.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

574.71 576.23 A: and then 

576.44 584.44 A: assigning fines to the law but i've never actually heard of anybody getting getting written up for smoking in a public place 

576.50 578.12 B: [noise] 

584.50 588.97 A: i've heard of i mean the most like the peo- probably the people at the uh 

585.06 586.42 B: [noise] 

589.66 595.30 A: at the business will tell you to not smoke but what are they gonna do past that 

593.29 599.89 B: yeah they'll probably just tell 'em to go outside but as far as them actually i mean because you got you got people
