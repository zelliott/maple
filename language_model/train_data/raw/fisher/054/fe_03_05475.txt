112.16 120.87 B: well have you noticed a difference in your willingness to stay in bars or clubs that are smoke free as opposed to 

121.21 122.81 B: not smoke free 

122.69 133.87 A: well it's it's been less of an issue whenever i go out that i don't have to worry about oh am i going to be in a smoking place am i gonna the the one thing that i that i personally enjoy about it is

145.51 148.39 A: um if you can tell i'm a college student so kin- 

147.67 149.45 B: i suspected yes 

148.98 153.55 A: kind of uh kind of lazy not real interested in in washing uh 

153.70 155.85 A: just clothes every time i go out 

155.31 158.27 B: i hear that [noise] i hear that 

157.64 159.27 A: and how has it affected you 

159.46 168.99 B: well i don't like to go to places [noise] where there's uh uh smoking um i like the fact that i can 

169.07 172.63 B: not have to have clothes that are smoke 

173.12 177.64 B: filled and uh i've i've been to 

177.73 192.35 B: a couple of the places where they have a smoking room or a smoking night and i found that i didn't like it nearly as much the food didn't taste as good and everybody was too busy blinking smoke out of their eyes or 

192.31 196.66 B: or waving it out of their face and i just didn't [noise] feel it was uh 

196.71 200.53 B: and i [noise] think that people who i don't smoke i used to smoke 

200.66 204.15 B: oh probably as long as you've been alive okay 

204.54 206.42 B: if you're a college student 

205.62 206.71 A: understood 

206.63 209.11 B: and um um 

209.74 215.86 B: i just find people are not as pretentious or self conscious maybe is a better word 

214.77 215.49 A: right 

216.01 225.41 B: if they're not smoking i'm not saying that they're not pretentious or self conscious but it just [noise] a lot of people when they have a cigarette in their hand um 

225.43 230.37 B: they're so preoccupied with being cool that um 

231.23 234.46 B: it's hard to walk and chew gum at the same time 

234.18 245.88 A: so i guess along the other um topic of the conversation the the smoking uh like anti-smoking campaigns and whatnot i mean what what really brought about you not smoking any more 

245.39 249.54 B: oh i just uh i decided one day that i just didn't wanna do it any more 

250.15 255.24 B: so i stopped i'm i'm one of those strange people who stopped once not fifty seven times 

255.06 258.99 A: right understood i think it's ninety percent addictive 

259.20 262.47 B: oh i don't know i smoked for about four or five years 

262.66 271.20 B: and then i tried a a pipe and didn't much care for that it too much to do i was al- [noise] i don't think i need to keep my hands busy that way 

271.13 272.15 A: right 

271.51 285.35 B: and um [lipsmack] i smoked cigars for a few years and um still have one maybe once or twice a year but um i even find [noise] that i prefer to have those outside where [noise] i don't have to smell my own smoke i 

285.59 287.55 A: right right that 

286.46 293.36 B: like the taste i just don't like being around the smoke and i think that most [noise] anti smoking campaigns 

293.37 297.99 B: miss the point the point is smoking is bad for you it kills you 

298.42 308.08 B: uh if it doesn't kill you it certainly hurts your health if you're an athlete it cuts down on your breathing ability and it's [noise] hard to do any kind of sport without good breathing 

308.23 309.28 A: understood 

309.24 311.34 B: so um 

312.07 315.79 A: well i mean do you think that they're targeted at the right age bracket 

312.30 313.39 B: (( [noise] so )) 

315.18 324.64 B: i think so you know [noise] the younger the longer somebody [noise] postpones smoking the less likely i believe it is that they're gonna pick it up so start young 

324.65 329.59 A: right i i mean do you think that they're do you think that it's effective or do you think 

329.02 335.00 B: i don't know it's been so long since i was a teenager i don't know that it would affect me or that it would influence me 

335.55 344.32 A: um i personally never i'm kind of a nerd so i personally never had any like peer pressure to to do much of anything um 

344.24 346.96 B: well if you're going out to clubs how much of a nerd can you be 

346.55 349.48 A: [laughter] oh i i brew my own beer 

349.55 352.63 B: well it's funny i just wrote a novel on beer 

352.12 353.65 A: really what novel 

353.42 359.73 B: it's called first beer and it's about uh it takes place at the repeal of prohibition 

359.99 361.09 A: (( ah okay )) 

360.88 375.11 B: and it's about um three gals who are between twenty and thirty years old and uh how they came to have their first beer legal or not legal and how they came to have their first beer together because they don't know each other at the beginning of the book [lipsmack] 

375.48 378.05 B: and then some of the adventures they have 

377.94 380.39 A: oh sounds sounds pretty interesting 

380.67 383.11 B: yeah um 

384.09 385.85 B: [noise] and 

385.88 387.01 B: in 

387.11 395.18 B: the beer [noise] activities [noise] uh brewing your [noise] beer is i think it s a [noise] great idea i like [noise] ale more than i like beer 'cause i like more flavor 

394.75 397.12 A: right right in fact the only 

397.38 401.76 A: um the only thing that american beer making has contributed 

401.20 401.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

401.89 403.08 A: is uh 

402.07 403.46 B: [noise] refrigeration 

403.63 404.83 A: (( is um )) 

405.02 409.59 A: the anchor steam like a steam beer which actually comes from san francisco 

407.39 408.45 B: yes 

409.54 410.16 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

410.58 412.42 A: so i thought that was pretty interesting 

412.15 414.19 B: (( yeah [noise] th- that is )) 

414.32 419.68 A: yeah i think i think austin is just getting accustomed to the smoking ban 

419.79 424.17 A: i still see a i still see a lot of people disgruntled it passed by a very narrow margin 

424.83 428.25 A: i think um one one extra vote in the city council 

428.09 430.78 B: really that's very close 

429.21 430.24 A: yeah 

431.28 442.84 A: we i mean there there are a lot of people here that smoke but i wouldn't say i'm originally from dallas i wouldn't say any uh ab- abnormally large number 

444.35 456.88 B: mm okay well well then uh reasons that uh smoking and drinking seem to be combined quite a bit and uh when uh prohibition was repealed 

456.97 469.31 B: [lipsmack] uh it was a big shot in the arm for the tobacco industry because the beer the saloons and the bars and the such that were cafes that were uh opening up 

469.30 475.75 B: uh were looking for every way they could do make a nickel and um tobacco was one of those ways 

475.84 489.30 A: i think that uh a a lot of ways that they that they actually market is they'll send people around with a case of cigarettes to go into a bar and then hand out hand out cigarettes to some to people sitting at the bar 

484.58 485.82 B: mhm 

488.99 490.65 B: sort of like drug dealers do 

490.78 492.96 A: exactly [laughter] well 

491.92 495.41 B: only above board rather than under the table 

494.12 499.04 A: oh i mean it's however you wanna look at it it's still a drug it does something 

497.72 499.36 B: oh yeah no question [noise] 

499.28 499.86 A: (( [mn] )) 

500.25 503.18 A: um it's it's also regulated so hey 

503.46 514.61 B: well see i believe all those things should be legal uh regulated if the government needs money i would like to see uh what happens if they 

514.58 528.47 B: uh well you know they've been licensing or or taxing cigarettes for a heck of a long time um before uh prohibition and i would say just before world war one 

520.14 521.15 A: right 

528.49 536.91 B: beer was the largest or alcoholic beverages were were the largest single source of of federal tax revenue in the country 

537.49 544.20 B: and i believe that for many years tobacco sales were right up there 

544.50 549.69 B: putting a lot of money into the government and i wonder 

549.71 552.12 B: what the strange position is 

552.13 557.40 B: of the government subsidizing tobacco and then promoting against it 

557.34 567.78 A: right i mean that's one of the things i've i've often wondered about myself but they do a lot of things very crossed i mean i certainly i certainly would be for the for 

558.40 560.11 B: um 

563.79 566.19 B: yes crossed purposes yeah 

568.01 570.10 A: um you know the regulation 

568.88 576.50 B: so i i wonder if the if the government really got has been holding back on 

576.96 579.16 B: um 

579.26 586.99 B: i don't wanna say removing the freedom of choice 'cause that's not what i would want somebody really wants to smoke they should be allowed to 

586.88 599.89 B: i don't know any way that you could um [lipsmack] make it clear that tobacco is for occasional use not for two or three packs a day or you know a pack a week or a pack a month is maybe
