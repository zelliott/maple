8.11 10.37 B: [lipsmack] [mn] where are you uh where are you calling from 

9.83 14.09 A: uh at this point i am calling from brooklyn yes 

12.48 15.33 B: from brooklyn okay i'm down in philly 

14.80 17.14 A: uh i see you're only about two hours away 

16.62 18.52 B: yep yep pretty close 

17.65 20.30 A: i see i was just down there the other day actually 

19.69 20.83 B: (( oh were ya )) 

20.55 23.69 A: yes in the middle of the rain on friday 

21.04 22.29 B: anything uh 

23.33 26.60 B: oh yes uh were you work down here 

24.13 25.12 A: yes 

26.44 38.30 A: uh no actually i am a writer and so i travel all over the place i have a residence in both brooklyn and uh los angeles among other places but primarily those two places 

29.02 30.02 B: oh yeah 

36.10 37.14 B: (( oh okay )) 

38.10 40.30 B: okay so you ever write about time travel 

40.16 52.61 A: uh i have actually when i were a youth um i read quite a bit um in science fiction so but it was more on a philosophical rather than a uh technical level so 

46.48 47.46 B: yeah 

50.88 55.14 B: right do you stay what do you write now or what genres 

54.59 64.27 A: at this point i write both fiction and non fiction uh so it is about time past and uh i have to say strangely enough that um 

55.60 56.33 B: yeah 

58.11 58.99 B: okay 

64.43 71.46 A: uh there is some slight regret that's probably implied in what i write because i do um 

71.47 77.24 A: having been that it's been some years since uh what has happened uh about which i'm writing 

77.40 86.14 A: that um i did change the color a little bit uh in retrospect thinking in retrospect of what had occurred 

80.46 82.24 B: mhm 

82.76 83.74 B: mhm 

86.38 87.45 B: mhm 

86.70 90.66 A: so but at the same time i feel that i wouldn't um 

90.85 95.86 A: i don't think i regret in other words i would not change so much for what i had done 

96.42 98.89 A: (( [noise] um mhm )) 

97.83 98.71 B: (( yeah i )) 

98.93 101.15 B: i can't think of anything that uh 

104.08 114.68 B: i i i can't i i don't i don't mean uh i'm like you i don't really have any uh major regrets that i would that i would go back and change i think there are certain things that maybe 

114.84 118.63 B: i would have liked to have prevent if i had known that it was going to happen 

117.51 120.97 A: right as hindsight offers then one would 

119.23 129.44 B: right right but uh as far as like changing an action or something like that there's you know there's certainly some events that i wish had not happened [laughter] 

123.91 125.66 A: yeah 

128.76 133.31 A: yeah but you know the thing of it is uh a lot of people probably do and um 

133.46 137.80 A: afterwards but at the same time one has to accept that because um 

136.54 137.28 B: (( yeah )) 

137.86 144.22 A: that's just i don't know that's just the way that it is um personally i understand that um 

140.63 141.50 B: okay 

145.01 153.57 A: uh that a bit of uh a bit of a mix of both uh fate and fortune something that's supposed to be as well as something that can be um 

154.05 154.86 A: uh 

154.92 162.11 A: in what can i say uh the best analogy would be say a ship that's headed into a storm um 

162.49 172.10 A: the way that one steers it can either head it straight into the storm or you can head to the edge of it but you will be in the storm nevertheless 

171.52 172.47 B: (( mhm )) 

172.42 173.87 A: (( so um [mn] )) 

173.79 177.57 A: you know that's the best analogy as far as a mix of fate and fortune 

176.18 179.14 B: (( mm )) 

177.43 190.16 A: and basically one just has to um to appreciate the dynamic of life [noise] you can control a little bit of it but at the same time uh the way that one is the way that one's born uh [mn] 

181.55 182.68 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

190.35 200.91 A: uh from as something uh as insignif- as insignificant as one's name all the way to uh one's familial uh 

200.48 202.29 B: (( mhm [noise] mhm )) 

201.93 205.49 A: [lipsmack] connections is going to influence one 

205.31 206.37 B: mhm 

205.64 208.79 A: some of it you can help some of it you cannot 

208.42 210.15 B: yep a mix of um 

210.81 220.12 B: opportunity and choi- opportunity of things that you uh can't control and certainly things decisions that you make and and things like that it's [noise] 

219.39 225.10 A: this is correct i mean such as when i was in philadelphia the other day i knew i was going to go there 

225.11 235.04 A: um i put myself there in that situation in order to deal with a client at the same time i walked around all day in the rain for six or seven hours 

233.02 233.88 B: (( yes )) 

234.68 235.54 B: yep 

235.13 242.06 A: but at the same time um i had no problem with that and as you can hear i'm quite healthy despite that 

241.03 242.82 B: [laughter] 

242.68 254.64 A: so um i walked all the way from broad street along snyder all the way up to i think there was a uh an interstate up that way i don't know if you're familiar i think it's southern philadelphia where that is 

249.85 250.77 B: okay 

254.23 258.28 B: uh i'm i'm not sure exactly where snyder is 

257.94 262.31 A: snyder from what i understand um it's along the orange line 

261.69 262.94 B: oh okay 

262.70 263.98 A: (( um )) 

264.46 273.92 A: i know there are about four or five lines there somewhat like los angeles uh there's a blue line which i took to the broad street line which is the orange line 

266.84 267.73 B: yeah 

273.32 274.50 B: yeah 

274.29 284.90 A: and um exited at snyder and broad and then walked uh along snyder all the way down i don't know about thirty blocks 

278.31 279.37 B: (( oh okay )) 

284.59 286.93 B: you were down in south philly you said okay 

286.32 291.74 A: exactly so when i came out i was at thirtieth street 

290.99 292.18 B: right 

291.61 296.93 A: so you're probably familiar with that that's in central philadelphia from what i understand 

292.57 293.95 B: yep sure 

294.70 295.46 B: (( sure )) 

295.62 296.69 B: yep 

296.75 306.85 A: and then from there i took the um the broad street line down and i knew i was going to go there but at the same time i was not going to be as far as i were concerned affected by the weather from my goal 

305.28 306.05 B: yep 

307.00 308.32 A: and um 

309.32 314.52 A: so i did what i had to do and um and there you go [mn] [noise] 

312.75 318.44 B: yeah that's nice do you um may i ask you it's sort of off topic but uh do you 

318.56 322.90 B: believe in uh that time travel's possible 

323.69 327.01 B: or will be possible at some some juncture in time 

326.49 333.67 A: um in a way yes because um and and that's rather difficult to explain why 

333.73 334.87 A: um 

336.60 345.44 A: [noise] what can i say i i i feel that books in themselves for instance are a way of time travel someone who is able to impart uh 

344.37 345.24 B: right 

345.55 350.72 A: [mn] uh the texture the color of their time into a way that is timeless 

350.50 351.39 B: (( [mn] )) 

350.85 362.09 A: to someone several centuries later and someone can travel back i think that a very g- uh good example hilarious as it may be and i don't know if you're familiar with it is don quixote cervantes 

353.08 354.18 B: right 

360.81 361.58 B: yep 

361.69 364.28 B: yeah i'm i'm uh working on it right now 

362.60 365.62 A: and the way that oh you are okay 

364.70 367.67 B: i i'm working on it in spanish so 

366.22 369.40 A: okay but the way that um um 

369.43 374.38 A: he and sancho panchez um go back in that strange way 

371.01 371.96 B: mhm 

374.27 375.12 B: mhm 

374.47 380.45 A: they're able to capture the color of the time in such a way and so vehemently as 

380.32 392.74 A: most people they attacked wo- would certainly attest [laughter] and cervantes himself was a was a warrior who actually uh used some of the incidents that uh he had encountered um 

383.97 384.92 B: mhm 

392.63 405.10 A: to put forth in that that uh strange chivalry and even at this time someone who reads it can enjoy both the humor and with a few foot notes the color of that time some centuries ago 

404.69 410.44 B: mhm what about uh time travel go time travel in a more physical sense okay 

406.19 407.03 A: so 

410.33 412.13 A: that 

412.71 413.59 A: no 

413.87 419.79 A: i have to i have to disagree that is something that is merely a wish in the same way that uh 

420.14 421.56 A: um 

422.24 428.02 A: someone who is looking to have uh to cast themselves in 

428.50 432.00 A: in the same way that they think that their god is no 

431.28 433.06 B: yeah yeah i agree 

432.08 436.83 A: i think that it's rather silly because uh it's it's something that uh 

437.66 443.04 A: you can all i can say is one can really get into the uh philosophical 

443.45 451.29 A: aspects of it and um and even lead to the the argument saying who is it that defines consensual reality 

450.81 452.17 B: mhm 

451.47 452.46 A: so 

452.97 454.70 A: as for my belief no 

454.68 456.10 B: (( yeah that's why i )) 

456.47 459.11 A: there would not be atro- um atrophy 

459.03 472.93 A: i think that um physically defies that otherwise i mean if there if there were time travel available we would not grow old and grow apart an hour out there in the cells that hold our body together 

470.09 471.17 B: (( mhm )) 

472.93 477.56 B: [mn] yeah i would agree i i actually recently bought um 

477.75 483.90 B: [mn] stephen hawking his uh a brief history of time yeah 

482.50 490.05 A: yes i've read part of that and i've actually seen the um a video that was made from that some years ago it was rather interesting 

484.29 485.01 B: do 

488.61 489.76 B: oh really 

490.19 501.78 B: yeah i it's it's something that i've i've talked to about it like this this idea of uh you know space and time and all that it it it's not something that i can 

501.80 508.56 B: conceptualize and i mean i'm guessing that there are very few people that can even that even stephen hawking himself 

506.42 518.59 A: yes perhaps he can but at the same time he has no he has almost no physical being and it it actually has atrophied at such a rate it's unimaginable to anyone else 

518.18 519.13 B: (( yeah i )) 

519.17 520.31 B: it just uh i 

520.52 521.70 B: mean to 

522.10 529.61 B: for those that you know like when those that argue that time travel is possible often say like well you know 

529.69 540.46 B: look back a hundred years ago and people thought we would never be flying a plane and going to the moon well yeah but those are very physical barriers that warranted us to get over get over versus like uh 

537.35 538.92 A: very much so 

538.95 539.90 A: yeah 

540.48 549.08 B: time is really it's something it's al- it's almost something that we made up you know it's it's just a form of measurement to measure one event from another 

544.75 546.91 A: it it is it very much is 

546.93 547.88 A: yes 

548.57 554.90 A: it very much is in fact the western world is almost exclusive in holding that time is what it is mhm 

554.27 563.34 B: yeah it's it's the for us time is very tangible and that's why i feel like some people might believe that it's possible to go time travel but 

558.99 559.97 A: yeah 

562.39 568.54 A: right and who knows it it i mean eventually it may be but i don't see that occurring any time soon 

568.27 569.32 B: (( well there's )) 

568.45 580.79 A: and at the same time that it's not something that than um other than the science fiction with which i write and uh my colleagues write that i'm going to worry too much about it's fun to read about 

576.20 577.56 B: mhm 

578.90 579.75 B: yeah 

580.18 583.05 B: yeah yeah it's yeah it's definitely fun to read about 

582.34 583.95 A: right but i mean 

584.29 595.18 A: i think that a very good example of it um of the way that the western world holds exclusively the concept of time can be held in um a strange anecdote 

595.37 599.89 A: about um i wouldn't say so much an anecdote but um
