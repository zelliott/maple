18.07 20.20 B: know it's a lot of money but uh i 

20.74 23.84 B: don't know [noise] it's kind of a kind of a sellout not to talk to your 

24.13 25.43 B: best friend you 

24.21 28.80 A: [laughter] that that yeah that's that is kind of uh 

25.77 26.61 B: (( know ))

51.74 57.14 A: i think about the same as you i mean uh a million dollars is a lot but uh 

57.28 62.34 A: that's just kind of a strange stipulation uh maybe if it was a lot more money you know 

62.22 69.38 B: yeah well i mean yeah what's what's the deal like what what's the anonymous uh benefactor getting out of it [noise] you know 

68.94 70.48 A: yeah that's why 

69.65 73.02 B: saying that you can't uh talk to your [noise] best friend 

72.48 77.00 A: yeah exactly i mean it just doesn't really make much sense but [laughter] 

77.01 79.40 A: (( 'cause that was the topic of the day i don't know )) 

79.39 82.91 B: yeah so um i don't know

132.02 137.01 B: yeah it's it's a decent amount of money but i mean a 

134.86 137.57 A: [noise] would you probably invest or something 

137.46 144.05 B: yeah i would invest it i i don't know uh you know i don't think it's enough to retire on or anything like that 

142.98 144.31 A: yeah that's true 

144.17 145.51 B: so um

159.17 159.89 B: [noise] 

160.39 161.64 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

161.46 164.48 A: just just to kinda drop your best friend and uh 

164.84 170.61 A: you can't just get one i guess it take a lot of time and uh true you know and just being uh 

170.81 172.20 A: kind of uh 

172.86 177.17 A: loyal and it's it's not it's not that easy you know 

176.90 183.28 B: yeah i mean i'm not i'm not sure if i have uh you know like a best friend actually i think [noise] [noise] 

181.57 192.57 A: [noise] a- actually yeah i was gonna say the same thing now that i'm thinking i have a few good friends but i don't i mean i didn't i haven't really used that term since like elementary school you know 

191.68 200.64 B: [noise] yeah right i m- i think i think maybe women have more like best friends than than guys do i don't know 

193.34 194.14 A: [laughter] 

200.25 202.91 A: as adults yeah you're probably right i don't i 

201.70 202.45 B: [noise] 

203.23 208.45 A: don't know why that it is but uh yeah they have like confidantes and uh 

206.07 207.24 B: (( [noise] )) 

208.05 209.89 B: [noise] right [noise] 

208.61 211.81 A: exactly that's true that's a good point i mean [noise] 

211.98 219.80 A: i don't know if i'm like [noise] like typical but i i just have like you know about three or four good friends and uh 

219.52 221.29 B: yeah 

220.11 227.52 A: that's about it you know in terms of uh sharing intimate stuff i don't really do that too much but i guess 

226.90 229.50 B: right yeah me neither [noise] 

228.97 234.32 A: i mean i did have a best friend you know like growing up and stuff like that but that's totally different you know 

234.26 241.91 B: [noise] right right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i did too ac- actually i'm still in touch with him but but not uh 

234.80 236.70 A: like as a kid as a kid 

241.96 249.64 B: yeah not that closely like i know what he's up to and stuff but we don't we don't [noise] uh stay in touch a lot or anything so 

244.93 245.85 A: yeah 

248.52 249.38 A: yeah 

249.92 260.53 A: i guess yeah i mean uh i don't know if maybe that's just the way we socialize or what but you know you just naturally uh as you grow up you just kinda you're just more independent you know 

260.13 262.65 B: mhm yeah 

260.95 262.82 A: as a guy i guess i don't know 

262.72 269.03 B: and then you know i guess if if you get married or you know whatever i- ideally then 

269.14 278.05 B: you know like your your wife or or whoever's in your life [mn] you know should be your best friend i guess i- ideally uh 

275.14 276.74 A: ideally yeah 

276.99 279.42 A: yeah that's true i mean i don't know 

278.17 284.27 B: i don't know how often that actually happens but [noise] [laughter] [noise] no i'm not 

279.76 282.89 A: [laughter] exactly yeah are you married 

283.36 291.76 A: nah me either but yeah i mean i always say like i w- w- definitely want that as like a criteria to really have like a

285.38 286.40 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

291.90 296.93 A: trust and a and a friendship that's just beyond like sex and and all that kind of stuff 

295.56 305.86 B: right right [noise] yeah i mean i think i think that's important i you know i don't know like like i said [noise] i don't know how much it really happens how realistic it is but yeah 

304.01 308.53 A: yeah well there's just probably a few out there [laughter] 

307.11 309.48 B: yeah hopefully [laughter] 

308.72 315.74 A: yeah i don't know hopefully it's not it's not that bad to you know but all the statistics like divorce and all that stuff but 

315.20 319.53 B: yeah i don't know my my girlfriend just left for australia for a year 

319.57 320.47 B: so 

319.61 322.13 A: a year oh study abroad or something like that

333.72 337.56 A: ah that's cool so she's kinda like you- like a best friend 

337.99 350.43 B: um i mean like sh- i don't know it it was kind of uh just a couple of months we were going out before she left so like i don't i don't know i don't think it really developed [noise] there yet but 

349.85 351.98 A: oh i see oh that's good 

351.07 354.12 B: (( yeah so i don't know [noise] ))

368.33 373.56 A: yeah with with girls you kinda have to have a balance uh especially in the beginning of uh 

368.75 370.32 B: (( however [noise] [noise] )) 

373.70 382.36 A: you know the romantic aspect and the friendship because if you have too much of the friendship sometimes it kinda doesn't work out you know what i mean 

381.34 389.74 B: yeah it just [noise] it just kinda peters out yeah no i'm that's the thing like a- at first she wanted to be you know just friends 'cause she knew she was going away and stuff but then 

383.34 384.78 A: exactly 

389.73 400.04 B: you know like we just got got more involved and stuff so i mean i i was happy the way it it worked out still it stinks that she's you know in australia but you know 

390.19 391.74 A: it developed yeah 

399.15 404.47 A: she just randomly picked australia like she just wanted to have a a diverse experience or something 

404.13 405.88 B: yeah like she um 

406.12 407.77 B: she had uh 

408.57 420.45 B: she had matched for radiology next year and she had like a year to to pretty much do whatever she wanted to do you know so like uh why not go to australia
