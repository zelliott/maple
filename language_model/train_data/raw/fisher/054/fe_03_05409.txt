77.70 79.41 B: (( yeah )) 

80.58 81.94 B: this is quite a 

84.05 86.92 B: if you had that million dollars though what would you do with it 

88.14 90.84 A: wh- what would i do i would uh 

90.85 94.26 A: well i'd get myself out of debt and take care of my family 

94.64 97.58 A: make sure all my kids are set up for college and stuff 

97.72 100.18 B: [noise] well all of mine are married so

101.24 104.75 B: (( [laughter] oh yeah )) 

105.21 106.59 A: but uh 

106.86 111.57 A: yeah i'd take care of my family uh my in laws and my father who's 

112.22 117.01 A: still alive and then uh i think i'd give a lot of money to the church too 

116.98 119.27 B: yeah i'd probably do that 

120.71 122.06 B: but i guess 

122.04 127.40 A: but as it is now i just take one day at a time and do the best i can with it 

123.64 124.28 B: (( i'd )) 

126.63 128.78 B: that's that's the only thing we can do 

128.70 129.91 A: (( oh yeah )) 

129.31 134.55 B: and that's uh you know it and in spite of having a million dollars that's all we can do anyway 

135.16 136.38 B: if we had it 

136.89 140.12 B: just take one day at a time and do the best you can on that day 

140.64 142.16 A: oh yeah i mean 

142.25 143.85 A: (( i'm in law enforcement )) 

142.42 148.87 B: did you ever do uh the the only thing money does is make it a little easier to do bet to do the best [laughter] 

148.50 153.16 A: well i look at it this way the more money you have and the more you make the more you spend 

152.57 154.17 B: that's right 

153.61 154.79 A: (( you know so )) 

154.89 160.65 B: yeah well uh i've seen people that make three times as much as i do that are further in debt than i 

162.48 167.46 B: am and i don't imagine anybody's going to offer me a million any time soon anyway so 

167.54 175.05 A: right but you cherish the moments you have and the money might help it out a little bit but it's not going to uh 

168.15 168.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

175.79 178.09 A: it's not going to get you that friendship 

177.91 179.28 B: nope nope 

178.16 182.88 A: tha- that you already have and you've already worked hard to get to where you are 

180.34 180.95 B: (( no )) 

182.49 184.11 B: that's right 

184.84 190.32 A: i mean because i think i think of all the money like that would just change it and ruin the friendship 

190.20 194.28 B: yeah i've seen people that's won some of them big lotteries that uh 

194.57 197.82 B: they end up getting divorces and end up uh 

198.04 199.87 B: losing all their friends 

199.67 200.88 A: mhm 

200.29 203.79 B: and in two or three years they're flat broke again 

203.96 205.05 A: (( oh yeah [noise] )) 

206.67 211.72 B: and i had uh i went to school with some folks back in wyoming where they uh 

212.86 214.86 B: struck oil on their place 

215.59 217.98 B: and then they forget people and they 

218.38 220.90 B: them and their kids ended up being 

221.88 222.72 B: uh 

222.65 228.32 A: yeah but there's only a a very few and far in between that money doesn't change them 

227.55 228.72 B: that's right [noise] 

230.36 236.33 A: yeah and like i said yeah i i'd have fun i'd be able to do a lot of things differently but 

236.79 239.03 A: you're not going to have that friendship 

238.83 242.05 B: that's right all that uh 

242.95 248.06 B: if you if a person be willing to sell out their friends and part of the family either one 

248.21 249.34 A: mhm 

248.74 249.99 B: (( for that they )) 

250.10 252.40 B: they don't have much character theirself 

254.53 255.39 B: (( you know )) 

257.31 258.22 B: that's 

258.32 261.30 A: i guess you could just consider that you're rich with uh 

261.34 268.73 A: love and friendship with with family and friends and stuff and you don't need all that money 

263.00 264.30 B: yep

268.21 269.01 B: no 

269.84 275.21 B: i can't think of anything i'd do any different 

276.93 278.27 A: (( so no )) 

278.28 281.95 B: if i had it and it it you know it you 

282.95 293.31 A: like i said i just i would just uh end up spending it anyways trying to you know getting myself out of debt and my family out of debt and make sure my kids are s- set 

286.37 287.71 B: (( know yeah )) 

293.19 297.91 B: like that old saying goes if i had all the money in the world and i mean all the money in the world

300.82 301.99 A: (( mhm )) 

301.38 302.12 B: (( [laughter] )) 

302.13 303.16 B: (( [laughter] )) 

302.86 305.88 A: uh you're just going accumulate more bills in life anyway 

305.48 312.12 B: well that's right that's right yeah friends are good friends are few and far between 

307.60 308.84 A: (( so [noise] )) 

312.67 313.50 B: (( you know ))

326.53 327.64 A: oh yes 

327.37 334.73 B: and you'd probably have a cluster of fair weather friends if somebody give you a million dollars 

335.18 336.66 A: oh that's true 

336.25 337.95 B: but to uh 

338.78 344.02 B: turn your back on somebody that's been your friend through thick and thin forever you know 

344.01 346.25 A: and then you got some friends that uh 

346.60 350.72 A: they're your friends as long as you you got something they want and as soon as 

349.49 350.25 B: yeah
