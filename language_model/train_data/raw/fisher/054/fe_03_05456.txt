4.19 5.08 A: yes 

6.41 7.60 A: good to meet you 

7.51 8.72 B: where do you live 

8.10 9.85 A: [laughter] i live in new jersey 

9.80 12.85 B: okay i live in new york queens 

10.40 11.22 A: (( you )) 

11.87 12.80 A: (( oh yeah )) 

14.27 15.68 A: not so far from here 

15.06 18.23 B: so we're supposed to talk about how we find out about our current events 

17.62 21.46 A: yeah so how do you find out about current events 

21.30 22.53 B: um 

22.59 26.61 B: sometimes over the internet when i'm surfing the w- the internet and sometimes 

24.01 24.94 A: yeah 

26.83 30.78 B: like i'll i'll have a t._v. on in another room and i'll listen i'll listen to the news 

30.29 31.05 A: (( mm )) 

30.91 34.25 B: while doing something else 

33.47 41.68 A: yeah so i i hardly ever watch the news lately i used to watch the news almost daily and then 

40.24 41.21 B: yeah 

41.96 49.55 A: i i stopped watching t._v. in general and so now i'm mostly reliant on the internet um or 

49.79 63.16 A: once a week i go to my parents house where there's ah time magazines so i read the time magazine and that usually keeps me up but i actually kind of feel like i don't know what's going on a lot of the time things are news to me after they've already happen 

54.39 57.93 B: (( right yeah )) 

63.07 68.90 B: yeah i used to be like that too i'm a little bit more current now i also get a a sunday times 

66.18 66.89 A: (( mm )) 

68.32 69.88 A: yeah see that's 

69.27 74.39 B: which has a lot in it and i don't i don't r- really read it all it's too much to read but 

72.20 73.17 A: yeah 

73.48 77.68 A: it's a bit much the times there's a there's a i like time magazine um 

77.09 78.53 B: yeah 

78.12 85.03 A: because it's all sort of consolidated problem is by the time i get to it it's at least a week old and then magazines 

84.02 87.45 B: and usually the the news in time magazine is a week old when they publish it 

87.18 88.18 A: yeah 

87.90 93.74 B: they have to have to plan several days in advance i guess to make up their magazine so it's usually kind of old when they publish it 

93.75 96.69 B: but if you get to it late it's like really kind of old 

93.80 94.88 A: right 

95.94 109.03 A: so the only thing i really the only the really catch are issues and stuff that's already happened internationally like i i find out just today about the civil war in in liberia or whatever and ah no 

99.63 100.70 B: right 

108.06 111.97 B: yeah i've i've known a little bit about it haven't really been paying close a- close attention 

111.53 114.31 A: i think it's i think it's just now starting to 

114.49 117.01 A: make it on american television 

116.77 117.94 B: yeah 

117.23 123.34 A: but i mean that's another thing the especially during the iraqi war the the media just seemed so ah 

123.76 128.30 A: centered here and like you couldn't turn on the t._v. without ah 

128.94 134.75 A: ah being inundated with the same information when there was other information available online 

134.85 138.55 A: or reading reading russian newspapers translated 

135.27 136.09 B: right 

138.67 139.90 A: but then 

140.00 149.15 A: on the in- then it seemed like that was too far against the war then to make it reliable anymore it's like there was no middle ground it seemed to me 

149.69 160.08 B: well i used to listen to n._p._r. when i was lived in new jersey and i drove to work i would listen to n._p._r. everyday if they have the b._b._c. they have the b._b._c. on too i think at one at one spot 

153.45 154.56 A: yeah i 

154.94 156.76 A: i listen to n._p._r. whenever i drive 

159.46 172.55 A: yeah the b._b._c. the anything anything that's not american is usually a little more reliable yeah and just just to get an international view at least if if you're dealing with international issues 

164.05 165.59 B: you get a different point of view 

171.61 173.15 B: yeah 

173.53 178.55 A: i don't know i i usually and then from friends i find out i have a i have a friend who's who 

178.81 186.12 A: treats politics like other people treat baseball or or music he's he's obsessed with it and so 

186.39 197.79 A: he just graduated college and he's and he moved to d._c. to get a job but um i used to find out just about everything political from him but he's gone now [laughter] 

188.03 189.26 B: yeah 

197.94 204.92 A: so from the last last time i saw him he he he got me up to date on on ah the democratic nominees but ah 

205.14 207.07 B: yeah there were a bunch of 'em 

206.46 209.48 A: yes there's there's there's lot of 'em but ah 

210.03 210.91 B: (( [mn] )) 

210.65 220.16 A: then after that i i started looking on the net about some of the candidates and so it's he was always sort of a catalyst for ah you know 

220.26 234.59 A: keeping up on politics just 'cause he was so interested in it that he would always start talking about something and i'd be like what the hell's he talking about then i'd go back to the internet and figure out what issue he was actually pin pointing and while i was talking to him i was just smiling and nodding 

222.49 224.25 B: yeah 

234.87 236.20 A: (( but ah )) 

236.91 240.70 A: since since he's been gone for a month it's been ah 

240.91 243.49 A: i've been less and less informed [laughter] almost 

245.01 246.12 B: yeah 

246.48 249.92 B: i haven't really been keeping up but um 

251.26 255.31 B: it's hard i mean i- i'm very busy i mean i don't really have a lot of time to 

255.08 256.33 A: (( yeah )) 

255.75 259.18 B: watch and listen to the news and i i don't have the patience for it either 

257.42 258.28 A: right 

258.68 261.49 A: yeah and because there are there are 

260.89 264.23 B: i figure anything really important i'll i'll manage to get hold of 

262.88 264.28 A: right [laughter] 

264.24 271.14 B: like with the o- with there was like given the o._j. thing i didn't have a t._v. at that point so i missed the whole chase scene on t._v. i missed a lot of it 

267.50 268.28 A: yeah 

270.10 272.27 A: well you were lucky you were better off [laughter] 

272.10 274.40 B: [laughter] and people were obsessed by 

274.29 277.88 A: yeah and i mean it it got to a point of ridiculousness 

278.31 283.28 A: i mean this that's the whole thing though with with news is sensationalist too so 

283.41 286.60 A: on one hand you want to be informed of what's going on with 

286.73 291.35 A: the surroundings but on the other hand you don't want to be taken in by whatever the biggest sensation is 

291.58 293.31 B: (( it right )) 

292.62 294.36 A: it's like 

294.70 297.39 A: i don't know that's why the the internet is is 

297.40 299.19 A: (( is such a blessing )) 

297.88 306.45 B: well the internet's pretty good but i i w- a lot of times round i watch the news or listen to the news on t._v. they'll say the same thing i read on the internet but a few hours ago 

302.82 303.60 A: (( mm )) 

305.90 307.97 A: right yeah [laughter] 

307.00 311.23 B: i mean they they even the same stories i mean i think they probably get their news from the same sources 

310.55 312.38 A: yeah yeah yeah they're all 

311.38 315.71 B: that's the scary thing is if there's just a few sources and everyone's getting their news from them 

315.44 316.36 A: right 

315.77 323.10 B: now if they miss something or they're there's pl- taking a slant on things of that whoever it is i can't associated press or whatever everyone gets it 

319.60 320.54 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

321.67 322.71 A: (( every- )) 

322.92 328.00 A: you just sort of assume the associated press is impartial but yeah that's true 

328.68 329.58 A: (( i don't know )) 

331.37 332.38 A: (( so )) 

331.64 336.39 B: yeah i still listen on occasion to pacifica radio i don't know if you're familiar with 

336.04 337.46 A: no i don't know that one 

336.82 338.11 B: (( them wbai )) 

338.23 343.50 B: they're very leftist but they're they're slanted also but at least i know it's not 

340.24 341.02 A: (( ah )) 

344.01 344.73 A: (( mm )) 

346.92 349.15 A: have you read the onion dot com 

349.11 352.54 B: i like the onion yeah it's always on it's always on the internet 

349.75 351.19 A: (( yeah i love the onion [laughter] )) 

352.41 353.20 A: (( huh )) 

352.88 355.04 B: i sometimes get it when i'm in the 

355.20 356.94 A: (( oh yeah )) 

356.13 358.71 B: (( i didn't i didn't realize the onion had an internet site )) 

358.76 363.87 A: yeah that's it's it's their their site is is where they're primarily published now 

363.98 364.91 B: yeah 

364.01 367.45 A: but um the that for a while 

367.57 370.53 A: more so than reading real news i was reading the onion 

370.58 371.65 A: (( just ah )) 

370.80 373.05 B: well it's more it's much funnier anyway 

372.39 380.51 A: oh yeah [laughter] it's so much more entertaining and but i oh they had they had an article which i thought was was brilliant where they were taking about um 

374.21 375.51 B: mhm 

380.70 381.85 A: um 

381.90 395.66 A: it it was it was like a spoof on on all the on the ah nuclear weapons in iraq articles but it was that it was that nuclear weapons had been found in in ah north dakota and um the government doesn't know what to do about it 

386.74 388.04 B: right 

393.79 396.13 B: right i think i read i think i read that story 

395.54 409.57 A: yeah and then and then by the time you get to the end you realize that that that the weapons bases they're talking about are actually there [laughter] i thought that was brilliant that was great 'cause it was like it was like reality but the whole time you think they're just being stupid 

403.49 405.31 B: mhm 

410.25 414.67 A: i think i think that the onion has a way of taking thing to another level 

414.46 416.41 B: yeah 

416.78 418.08 B: yeah it's funny if 

418.44 430.79 B: it's funny i mean when you if you walk through manhattan you get all these ah different ah it's like boxes with free newspapers in them but the onion is the one i like the best but it's n- it's not that common 

427.00 428.46 A: yeah that yeah 

430.45 432.83 A: yeah that's one harder to find 

432.73 439.05 B: it's a little bit hard to find and you got new york press and the village voice that are easier to find yeah 

433.84 434.69 A: (( yeah )) 

435.54 438.37 A: village voice is everywhere yeah 

440.49 446.55 A: here here ah i go to college and ah we got the we got the campus paper 

442.57 444.39 B: yeah 

446.56 447.38 B: right 

446.83 449.37 A: and that has i mean 

449.97 455.87 A: it's a it's a good it's a good newspaper 'cause i went to another university before i came here this is rutgers and ah 

456.42 459.40 A: and they have i mean it's a full color 

459.85 469.07 A: real i mean they they try and they do a good job on it but they don't they there's only a limited space and limited resources for them to get international or national news 

469.22 474.88 B: yeah i don't remember my college newspaper having any international or national news it was just local campus stuff 

474.24 486.60 A: yeah see this one this one they do a good job and everybody here seems to dislike it they they they rat on it all the time but they don't they don't realize that that most universities don't have anything like this it 

486.27 487.49 B: right 

486.72 497.68 A: i mean i guess most of the big state schools will but but i i read i read that actually i forgot that's another way i get my information i read during the semester when when school's in session 

497.65 502.83 A: every day during lunch i'll just grab one of those papers and i'll i'll pretty much tear through the thing 

497.67 498.78 B: right 

502.93 504.63 A: and i mean 

503.60 505.84 B: you can every it c- comes out every day 

505.66 508.01 A: yeah it comes out well five days a week 

506.43 510.77 B: that's pretty that's pretty amazing for a college pa- for a college paper 

508.27 509.45 A: yeah it's it's 

510.15 518.98 A: yeah it's and then it's they have color print i mean it look- it looks like a it's it's tabloid style but it looks like ah a miniature version of a 

516.13 516.94 B: right 

519.05 520.52 A: professional paper 

520.44 521.74 B: yeah 

520.95 522.28 A: and um 

521.80 523.03 B: that's pretty good 

522.58 525.54 A: yeah it's and it's great that it's free too it's everywhere 

525.57 535.23 A: and i don't i don't get the students here they just assume that that it's got to be crap because it's coming out of the university but i mean there's issues with 

532.30 533.99 B: yeah 

535.33 543.28 A: with that as far as university politics go or where it is it is under the control of the university where ah 

543.96 555.76 A: it's in the past it seemed like they've they've been inf- they've been forced to say certain things i don't know how much freedom they have but that's university press that's another thing 

555.68 559.77 A: can never really tell if if what you're reading is going to be partial 

561.61 562.48 A: (( i don't know )) 

562.27 564.17 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

564.01 568.04 A: it's pretty much a recurring theme with all sources you never really know 

569.08 574.19 B: i used to work in manhattan and commute to new i was in an what i at the time i was living in new jersey 

573.56 574.42 A: uh-huh 

574.30 579.70 B: and one thing i found is that i took the bus home and just about every day someone left a paper on the bus 

579.29 580.68 A: oh yes [laughter] 

579.83 584.86 B: so i just took what [mn] you know picked up whatever paper was lying around on the on the seat 

584.56 585.65 A: yeah 

585.04 589.66 B: so i never knew what paper i was getting by the way i didn't feel like paying for it when i knew i'd get one for free 

587.92 591.30 A: oh yeah gee that's that's the best yeah 

591.93 599.95 A: if you're reading it everyday and then this is where you get different sources yeah but the the daily news and the new york ti- ah i mean the ah new york post 

595.28 596.32 B: yeah
