0.60 1.77 B: hello 

1.47 2.76 A: hi i'm ron 

2.80 4.31 B: hey i'm marius 

4.06 5.22 A: nice to meet 

4.92 10.01 B: it was nice to meet you ron i didn't understand exactly the topic can you repeat it for me 

6.16 7.21 A: (( you [sigh] so um )) 

9.30 19.30 A: i think that the topic is um whether or not public or private schools should have the right [sigh] to prohibit students from reading certain books 

19.20 22.57 B: oh okay so it's uh [mn] censorship 

22.24 33.37 A: [sigh] i i guess so i mean it would seem to be that they would be reading [sigh] i mean they could only prohibit certain books within the school they wouldn't be able to prohibit the students from reading the books altogether [sigh] 

32.92 42.45 B: uh yeah [mn] [laughter] so what do you think [laughter] about uh about the subject er are you in favor of proh- prohibiting some uh some books or not 

41.78 45.56 A: well i i i'm not in favor of any form of censorship i mean that's 

45.33 48.00 A: [sigh] uh you know i i believe in a um 

47.78 55.12 A: [lipsmack] a theory of media control called the marketplace of ideas where [sigh] um you know the the idea is that [sigh] 

55.00 63.10 A: with no censorship all ideas are put out to the public sphere and then [sigh] ultimately the [mn] the best ones will rise to the top 

63.46 69.47 B: yeah well i think we're on si- on the same uh page now but uh just for the sake of the argument um 

69.48 77.19 B: (( what do you think uh [mn] about some uh books that can can contain i don't know some indecent materials or )) 

76.94 77.52 A: [mn] 

77.42 80.23 B: some uh pornograph- explicit pornography 

79.95 81.14 A: (( i [mn] )) 

81.05 95.07 A: i mean it's hard to [mn] defend you know to distinguish between let's say pornography and eroticism you know and i think it's also a [sigh] that questions specifically about what's considered explicit is interesting in this part of the world because [sigh] there's 

95.25 98.80 A: you know there's no problem with showing explicit violence [sigh] 

98.68 99.58 B: (( mhm )) 

98.73 100.46 A: and you know [mn] 

100.25 106.02 A: both physical violence and psychological violence on t._v. and in movies and things like that but [sigh] 

105.95 118.84 A: it you know [mn] when it comes to showing sexually oriented material or nudity there's much more of a squeamish attitude and you go to other parts of the co- the world and it's it's really not like that [sigh] so i think that [sigh] 

112.19 112.93 B: (( mhm )) 

118.78 123.62 A: it's really when you're looking at the books within the school system you know it's [sigh] 

123.70 133.67 A: it begs a larger question of you know well is it just the books within the school system that contain sex that they wanna shelter children from or is it sex in general you know [sigh] [mn] 

134.54 147.92 B: [mn] i understand what if some students er just wants to see i don't know playboy magazine at school uh would you allow this in a public library or in a library for uh i don't know i co- one in university 

144.01 145.08 A: you see 

148.38 155.60 A: i [mn] at university everyone should be of age to you know you only have to be eighteen to buy pornography in this country so [sigh] you know 

154.64 160.34 B: i know i know but uh if you allowed the university to have it in their library 

160.02 161.53 A: sure why not [mn] 

161.30 167.00 B: [laughter] it's going to be a very fun university to go to i think [laughter] mhm 

164.86 175.24 A: yeah yeah and that's what i'm saying yeah you know i mean it's also because it's it's a from a you know [mn] you decontextualizing and let's say we're talking about an issue of playboy 

175.06 185.09 A: you know like [sigh] if you decontextualize it and instead of asking you know [sigh] how can a student read this magazine and and get the content you know they could take a 

185.03 192.77 A: look at that you know it could be valuable at the mental level you know like it it could be valuable at the level where [sigh] you know they use 

192.56 203.20 A: that kind of publication to you know reflect upon a broader topic you know or to pull an example [sigh] about something that they're researching you know like if [sigh] yeah it's i mean 

198.88 199.68 B: (( mhm )) 

203.06 209.31 A: [mn] of course you're gonna get the kids who go to the library and pull out playboy and take it home and jerk off to playboy you know but like [mn] 

209.23 217.65 A: you you whatever you know they're gonna do it anyway [mn] i i don't know it to me [sigh] you know there's very little 

217.54 226.70 A: i could say that you know shouldn't be available to folks you know like from a purely universalist not utilitarian point of view from a universalist point of view [sigh] 

222.88 223.50 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

226.29 236.08 B: [mn] [mn] mhm i can give you an example uh i was in at the business school so we had to do um i don't know um an uh a research on some online uh dating sites 

236.22 247.85 B: so uh it is from a business point of view [mn] but first couple of days i looked at all these online dating sites and i [mn] i don't know i research all kinds of uh [mn] of data about them 

247.62 261.22 B: so if someone from school who saw me say hey this guy is using the computer schools for uh online dating actually i was just doing the research and i probably just report and uh it was something i was allowed to do [mn] 

260.98 269.85 A: yeah sure see that's the thing it's no one can tell you the context in which you're supposed to look at things you know i mean [sigh] there's and and there are plenty of things 

261.60 262.51 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

269.74 270.59 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

270.58 280.04 A: that are implied in many classic works of literature that [sigh] you know aren't overt topics but [sigh] there's definitely [sigh] you know uh [sigh] it 

280.02 285.99 A: you know homosexuality in great works of literature there's definitely you know uh [sigh] 

285.91 295.53 A: love between young people and old people in great works of literature you know there's all there's many taboos that are addressed in [sigh] shakespeare an- you know like [mn] you 

295.36 302.29 A: know you pull up the white eurocentric canon and the non western canon of literature [sigh] you know 

302.14 309.35 B: i just want to ask you something uh i just read in western journal i think er that all the books published by teachers 

309.13 320.91 B: had to be i don't know equally correct had to be [mn] so they had to have uh all the pictures uh i don't know had to be had to have one woman in in the picture if it's a group picture 

320.68 324.81 B: or one uh one black guy and one white guy some kind 

321.79 323.60 A: (( oh oh oh oh oh )) 

325.14 332.67 B: of censorship that's what came up showing in their manuals uh i don't know what pictures they want [mn] 

332.90 346.06 A: yeah it's it that's interesting you know i mean i i i i taught actually i've been a teacher and i've been used textbooks with my classes and so [sigh] yeah and so you know i i've noticed that the textbooks now are are [sigh] 

341.35 341.91 B: (( [mn] )) 

345.91 350.25 A: different but not too different than the ones i used in school fifteen twenty years ago 

350.07 355.18 A: fifteen twenty years ago there was always a picture of a black kid in the crowd you know [sigh] 

354.71 355.52 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

355.14 366.64 A: there was always one black kid and you know now you have a black kid a korean kid a kid from pakistan you know like [sigh] you have a kid all shades of brown are represented you know [sigh] 

360.75 362.59 B: [laughter] 

366.03 367.40 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

366.49 376.31 A: and [sigh] to me it's like the same thing because it's still an overt gesture of trying to show how 

376.24 389.06 A: you know it's kinda like [lipsmack] in some ways it's the same today for me over affirmative action you know like is the policy is the util- like the universalist nature of the policy rotten 

388.95 399.43 A: probably [sigh] but as a utilitarian to counter let's say two hundred and fifty three hundred years of bad legislation [sigh] you know [sigh] they impro- 

397.38 398.21 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

399.24 409.04 A: they you know they used the same you know essence but reverse it it doesn't make it right from a universalist point of view but from a point of utility it does make the right so 

408.84 418.75 A: to me that question of you know are they being reverse censored in textbooks to have to put [sigh] you know a representation from every gender and geography and the all these things 

418.68 428.80 A: i mean it's it's not that they're i feel like they're being censored in saying that they couldn't show for example a page of all white people [sigh] but 

427.89 437.51 B: mhm okay uh in censorship they say one of the rules where never show a woman in in a kitchen because this will to degrade a woman because the woman 

436.57 438.11 A: right right and 

438.04 439.07 B: (( [sigh] )) 

439.58 440.47 A: but 

439.87 443.45 B: so what do you think about it it's not censorship [laughter] 

442.58 453.78 A: i think it's it's it's a little absurd like i said it de- it depends [sigh] on what the approach is are you a universalist or utilitarian you know like if if if 

452.33 454.39 B: yeah yeah you're right 

453.74 461.82 A: you believe that [sigh] or you need to make some overtures now to make up for [sigh] a prior errors of a civilization 

461.62 471.25 A: then [sigh] you're a utilitarian if you believe that [sigh] you should never make any preference based on anything even if one group 

463.88 465.07 B: [laughter] 

471.06 484.10 A: has enjoyed preference for so long and you're trying to do it in an effort to equalize the preference level [sigh] then you're a a universalist you know like [sigh] if you believe that you should [sigh] the [mn] the essence of your action 

484.10 494.09 A: you know if what you should do what you do in a situation should have the same essence as what you would always do you should always make the same decision [sigh] for example [sigh] it's always wrong to kill 

493.98 506.09 A: in a universalist you know [sigh] uh point of view now [sigh] if if you're a utilitarian if someone is coming at you and your only way to se- preserve your own life is to kill your aggressor 

505.86 515.40 A: then you're [mn] a utilitarian because you're saying the highest value the best outcome [sigh] comes from me staying alive and therefore i have to kill my aggressor 

515.18 518.52 B: [mn] i think i'm a utilitarian [laughter] 

517.84 531.86 A: yeah yeah i mean that's the thing like it's a it's a to be a bet- but you understand what i'm saying like you have to learn to strike a balance between the two because if you go too far in either direction [sigh] you become an extremist you know and extremism is where things get really dangerous 

519.26 519.82 B: (( [mn] )) 

531.69 533.32 A: i think 

532.72 536.74 B: (( yeah yeah you're right you're right you have to keep a balance because it's true [laughter] )) 

536.08 540.22 A: yeah it's hard though it's it's i don't know how you keep 

540.02 541.74 B: (( [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] i )) 

540.53 547.82 A: how you know i mean everybody has like [sigh] you know clev- mildly clever people feel like they uh [sigh] 

547.77 561.56 A: you know should try to be good people throughout their lives and yet they continue to do things that they know aren't good [sigh] you know like plenty of good people [sigh] cheat on their wives plenty of good people cheat on their taxes plenty of good people shoplift you know like 

561.40 570.75 A: and people are imperfect [mn] you know but i think that censorship in schools bring you back to the topic is extremist you know i think that it's it's 

570.78 577.14 A: it's saying absolutely you may not instead of you may choose to or choose to not 

576.95 582.12 B: uh it seems that we totally agree [mn] at this point [laughter] 

579.84 580.70 A: yeah 

581.06 585.81 A: yeah so what do you what do you think do you have any other thoughts on this 

582.58 583.96 B: um 

585.28 585.84 B: (( [mn] )) 

586.39 599.89 B: no but it's like exactly what i told you [mn] i'm i'm totally against uh censorship i think that uh in order to get the best outcome from the learning process you have to have access to all sources of
