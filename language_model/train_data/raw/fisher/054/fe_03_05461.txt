288.16 290.27 B: (( yeah )) 

288.66 294.70 A: i i i i i've gotten quite a f- lot of subscriptions to that in my lifetime 

294.15 301.65 B: yeah i i really enjoy it i uh they have some really kind of like you were saying i guess alternative type um 

303.27 312.47 B: [noise] [mn] topics that that they'll discuss you know a lot of things about the the war and and they give you kind of different sides from what you'd hear in just mainstream stuff 

313.20 318.03 A: right but um i know people think i'm crazy but um 

318.88 321.22 A: now hustler magazine 

321.54 327.90 A: um actually does and nobody believes me that i read it for the articles they absolutely do not believe it whatsoever 

326.95 328.00 B: [laughter] 

328.63 335.42 A: but they actually do have for for alternative you know for the type of magazine that it is 

333.96 334.81 B: uh-huh 

335.50 337.56 A: very excellent articles 

337.63 343.43 B: well that wouldn't surprise me at all because of the whole larry flynt thing you know it his his saga so 

340.49 342.29 A: right 

343.44 345.18 B: that wouldn't surprise me at all 

343.47 344.35 A: i mean 

344.70 346.18 A: that and um 

346.44 354.27 A: y- you know as far as the alternative um but but that's an excellent source i mean they they do really good um 

355.24 360.91 A: uh no- not necessarily interview playboy is more for interviews and you know uh 

361.34 364.82 A: less controversial material but um 

363.23 364.14 B: sure 

365.72 370.77 A: i- those are both excellent sources of course nobody will read 'em but um 

368.11 369.18 B: hm 

369.77 371.15 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

371.59 380.38 A: at least not for that purpose but um i i think yeah i try telling a lot of people about different forms of alternative media a- and uh 

381.88 386.23 A: y- you know i- it's nice to have you know like i said commercial radio uh 

386.41 391.61 A: or noncommercial radio it's so refreshing to have you know a community station 

388.00 389.03 B: yeah 

391.91 395.03 A: that can pretty much play whatever they want y- you know 

394.27 395.80 B: (( yeah )) 

395.45 396.85 A: and it just uh 

396.79 406.70 B: i- it is i guess the only problem with that is they well at least in l._a. they seem to be struggling to survive because you know they have to rely on member donations and a- and things like that so 

406.02 407.76 A: (( mhm )) 

407.43 410.81 B: uh whi- which part of uh florida do you live in 

410.42 412.67 A: (( i i'm in tampa )) 

411.91 415.44 B: okay i actually we spent two weeks in tampa last summer so 

415.77 417.85 A: doing 

416.84 422.31 B: [mn] um i had work to pick uh we were actually at a company called t._s._e. that was down there in 

421.12 422.25 A: what's the name 

422.53 426.51 B: uh t._s._e. it's a process engineering chemical company 

426.36 427.97 A: right 

427.47 432.60 B: and so i worked with a company that was co partnering with them and we were down there doing some 

433.08 437.02 B: um process development work [sigh] for a- adhesives 

437.58 438.64 A: for what 

438.56 445.38 B: adhesives and they c- uh they we scaled up adhesives in these kinda large reactor systems 

439.77 440.67 A: ah 

446.41 448.74 A: sounds interesting 

447.84 457.71 B: yeah it w- w- it was actually really interesting i i i really had a blast down there i i i got a hotel right on the the beach there and i'd i'd um go to you 

457.91 466.81 B: know work and i'd get off at five and i'd go right to the beach and that was just you know great and the people there were seemed great and i re- i really had a blast 

467.29 473.14 A: right now uh i probably shouldn't ask this question just quite yet but is this your second or third phone call 

473.47 475.40 B: uh this is my second phone call 

475.42 479.35 A: okay 'cause i missed two of 'em and now i'm getting a second one so hopefully uh 

477.14 478.52 B: (( [noise] )) 

479.38 485.13 A: i should get one more i don't know how long they keep keep these studies going 

482.98 495.45 B: yeah i i do- i don't know how that how that goes either i think they said something about like if i remember correctly it was like three phone calls and then um after that you could reregister i'm not exactly sure how that works 

495.90 497.66 A: right 

496.83 498.54 B: yeah 

498.18 500.90 A: so what was your yesterday what was your topic 

501.26 503.81 B: uh yesterday the topic was computer games 

505.16 505.93 A: (( huh )) 

505.61 518.46 B: yeah which i didn't really play that many computer games unfortunately the lady i talked to didn't play that many either um because otherwise i would have felt like a real fool [laughter] if somebody had been talking about all this stuff i was like okay [sigh] but um 

518.38 528.06 B: she she had a interesting and she was a a christian person and so she um was hoping that there would be more christian video games which i thought was kind of interesting 

527.99 532.70 A: yeah i have a neighbor i have i have a neighbor who's like that 

528.34 531.20 B: i've never even thought of that [laughter] 

532.29 533.04 B: yeah 

533.35 534.56 A: and uh 

536.03 540.36 A: yeah that that's see now why it's a shame that we can't make our own topics 

541.02 553.60 B: yeah i i mean it's it's always i i i think it's enjoyable just because you kind of find out about different people and you know different things in different parts of the country and then uh yeah how that all ties in together 

553.86 557.23 A: right i i just don't understand why they pick the titles 

557.71 562.67 A: li- like they do i would think that they would be more concerned on just hearing people communicate 

558.08 559.19 B: yeah uh 

562.74 570.37 B: y- yeah i guess they were trying to get i- [sigh] you know something that people would have in common and could 

570.62 576.97 B: be you know you really have to like listen to the other person say i don't know i mean 'cause i know they're trying to do a linguistics study so 

577.10 579.96 A: oh where did you hear about the study 

579.76 588.29 B: um i [mn] i read it in the l._a. weekly which is actually one of the alternative newspapers in l._a. they kinda it tends to be very liberal um 

587.76 589.52 A: right 

588.54 597.24 B: and they had a the little corner thing it said you know linguistics study at a s- um pe- i think it was the university of pennsylvania 

596.81 599.61 A: right so this is a legitimate study that we're
