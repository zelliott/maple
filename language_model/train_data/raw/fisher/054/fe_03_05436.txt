141.29 142.48 B: is it 

141.93 147.39 A: it is man but there's there's no job opportunities up there [lipsmack] and uh 

142.59 143.73 B: no shit 

147.45 151.14 A: i don't know that's uh see that's something that you don't experience in maine 

150.82 151.86 B: right 

151.35 157.86 A: like a lot of maine is just white caucasian people you don't get a lot of races going up there and working 

154.28 155.76 B: right same thing 

157.13 168.62 B: see the only thing like like you got philly and you got pittsburgh and harrisburg and that's about it you know but all the like like hick places and stuff it's just it's mm 

160.87 162.61 A: mhm 

163.22 164.47 A: really 

166.76 175.39 A: oh wow [laughter] i'm from the down i'm from down east maine like right on the coast so uh it's it's pretty nice like during the summer man but during the winter it's harsh 

175.57 179.50 A: you gotta you gotta definitely know how to take a winter if you ever want to go up to maine so 

179.37 193.08 A: but it's good man there's a lot of outdoor activities and shit to do like that and there's a lot fishing where i'm from and you know it's it's definitely cool but you definitely see a lot of woods and trees and so it's definitely different living down here in the city but i see a lot 

192.94 199.93 A: [noise] and [noise] you know it gives me a chance just to go out and i actually i'm right now i'm in the in the midst of finding a job so 

199.72 211.99 A: you know it i look around there are definitely a lot of races around the city and stuff so i mean it'll be pretty interesting if i get a job where i'm working with like other than white people because that's who i'm usually working with 

212.00 215.26 A: so it would definitely it's definitely gonna kick ass as soon as i find you 

214.14 221.86 B: right right see i i work in a prison so i i work with a lot of black people and stuff like that and affirm- a- actually affirmative action's used 

217.83 220.95 A: (( work in a you work in a )) 

221.96 227.71 B: where i work so that that's they base it they have like a quota where they'll hire only black women 

223.16 224.92 A: yeah 

227.79 230.68 B: for correctional officers so yeah 

229.05 230.18 A: really 

230.97 231.85 A: so 

232.31 235.49 A: that's not cool like do you agree with that mo 

235.80 248.64 B: uh i mean i agree with it but to me it is kinda discrimination i look at it this way okay like they have and i'm not racist or anything like that but they realistically they have like an all black miss america pageant right 

248.07 249.23 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

248.49 258.03 B: and that's okay now if you had like an all white miss america pageant man people would be screaming racism at the top of their lungs you know what i mean 

249.97 250.89 A: yeah 

255.43 259.89 A: [laughter] they would too [noise] they would 

258.43 261.91 B: the shit would hit the fan people would go ballistic you know 

261.98 263.49 A: but i 

262.67 270.52 B: that's just but and and the thing is even down at the prison it's like if they have a quota to say well we're gonna hire fifty white males 

270.24 272.15 A: (( yeah )) 

270.67 276.49 B: well then all the minorities complain but but but when it's hiring fifty black females nobody complains 

276.27 285.79 A: [noise] really see that's that's queer you know because us white people are looked down upon like that man you know if if we discriminate it's it's bad but if [noise] 

276.90 277.85 B: (( you know )) 

279.15 280.03 B: (( it is )) 

285.78 300.68 A: like another race wants to discriminate against us [noise] like it's not looked upon to be as bad you know [noise] i definitely hear where you're coming from i i see that a lot but i you know as you look at the world turn i don't think there's ever going to be a resolving 

287.88 288.72 B: right 

291.53 292.37 B: right 

300.94 305.11 A: a resolving issue that's gonna happen between all the races there's no way 

304.07 305.96 B: oh hell no hell no 

305.14 317.39 A: no one and that's an unfortunate matter because there's a lot of dispute and a lot of people like die every day because of it you know and it's definitely something that [noise] it's just it's just a shame to see you know 

316.75 324.06 B: yeah i look at it this way though man like all of them immigrants and minorities coming to this country i don't blame them i'm sure it's i was down in mexico 

321.93 323.71 A: yeah 

323.98 338.19 B: holy shit i'm talking uh uh i mean literally like like you're talking standing in line to buy like a roll of toilet paper i'm talking you had to stand in line for like an hour i mean i'm talking shoulder to shoulder people 

330.36 331.69 A: yeah 

333.35 334.21 A: [laughter] 

335.01 336.22 A: (( really )) 

338.24 340.72 B: i've never seen anything like it and 

340.32 341.88 A: that's crazy man 

340.99 344.88 B: i was like damn i don't blame you coming to the states more wide open you know 

344.36 351.25 A: yeah well you know our country is only so big though you know we can only allow so much to come into 

351.01 360.55 A: like that's the way i look at it like i mean we are like a fortunate country but some day if we like overpopulate it and stuff man we're gonna look at it you know 

360.40 366.10 A: we might not have and i mean nine eleven hit us pretty good here in new york city and shit man and i mean 

365.45 367.27 B: yeah whoa were you there for that wow 

366.87 374.30 A: i i wasn't here for that my sister was and you know i was just down to see it the other day like where the actual buildings stood 

373.93 374.94 B: right 

374.37 380.46 A: and like the impact of it and it's like a sight to see if you've never seen it [noise] and 

378.43 380.87 B: (( on only on t._v. that's i only saw )) 

380.44 394.01 A: yeah that's you know when i lived in maine that's all i could see was it on t._v. and it's definitely i- it'll move you if you ever come down and you experience just the sight of it and you know it's sort of like you can like visualize what happened like 

393.12 395.95 B: it on t._v. are they rebuilding anything there or 

395.53 397.21 A: pardon me 

396.43 399.09 B: are they rebuilding anything there or mm yeah yeah mm mhm 

398.69 408.58 A: uh you know they're actually getting ready to reconstruct it i don't think they have an actual structure yet they're kinda debating what they want to do but i have a feeling that the next structure will be bigger and better 

408.65 423.65 A: and they'll have like they'll definitely have a memorial site with it and it's just gonna kick ass man but it's gonna take some time like probably within the next maybe ten fifteen years so but i've been down there and they're just right now they're they're they're still clearing it out you know [lipsmack] 

423.72 426.34 A: so that's just how bad it was but i mean 

426.55 427.68 A: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

427.70 432.87 A: in a way it just it's it's bad that like other countries look down upon us 

432.95 439.46 A: you know to actually do something like to come into the country and like create a problem like that but i mean it happens every day in other countries 

439.61 447.39 A: but if we're the country that is the greatest [noise] you know people want to come here and i don't know because they gotta make up a 

447.48 456.18 A: they gotta make up a line or something that says right yeah the weather's going to or something i don't know but [noise] i mean it's it's ver- it's it's it's cool to see though so

569.92 572.11 B: so were you in shock when you came down 

571.78 575.92 A: [noise] well actually because i lived in boston for like five months 

575.15 576.41 B: ah okay

585.89 590.68 A: it's it's interesting so it's definitely a big move from boston to new york and then
