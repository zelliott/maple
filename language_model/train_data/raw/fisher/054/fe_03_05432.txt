3.18 6.01 B: hi it's roy where are you calling from

10.39 11.19 A: uh-hum 

11.02 14.75 B: so what do you think about the public school system 

15.15 17.17 A: [sigh] [sigh] well i think ah 

17.73 19.34 A: [sigh] that there's a 

20.08 24.93 A: [mn] lot of dedicated people in [sigh] probably in the system and ah [sigh] [mn] 

25.38 26.78 A: but i think ah [mn] [sigh] 

28.39 29.51 A: (( it's ah )) 

31.33 33.69 A: [sigh] been largely influenced by [noise] 

34.39 37.25 A: [sigh] people who have ah [sigh] agendas 

37.67 39.45 B: what sort of agendas 

38.85 40.39 A: (( to ah trade on )) 

41.76 43.66 A: [sigh] um like ah 

44.26 45.75 A: [sigh] to try to 

45.76 49.45 A: (( secularize [sigh] the children ah )) 

50.79 54.95 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] to lean toward in other words to lean toward a secular view 

55.07 56.83 B: uh-hum 

56.19 57.34 A: (( and ah [sigh] [mn] )) 

59.98 61.18 A: (( that ah )) 

61.67 70.14 A: i think lately that's become that [sigh] such that there's a [sigh] deficiency in moral teaching 

71.92 73.72 A: (( [mn] which is with ah )) 

76.03 80.20 A: [sigh] like um an intimidation to be politically correct 

81.96 88.47 B: [mn] [noise] [noise] well don't you need a secular viewpoint because there are many different teachings that people believe in 

88.63 90.88 A: [mn] ah yes but ah 

92.94 97.60 A: [sigh] [noise] but ah the secular [sigh] view should not be ah [sigh] [mn] 

99.47 102.51 A: imposed on any more than any other 

103.81 108.18 A: [sigh] it's j- just one viewpoint out of many and that i think ah 

106.77 107.68 B: (( [sigh] uh-huh [noise] )) 

109.90 110.91 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

111.42 112.93 A: the idea of ah 

113.04 119.02 A: [sigh] religious freedom [sigh] should allow children to explore all the different ideas rather than 

120.21 122.12 A: (( [sigh] ah dismiss religion )) 

123.56 127.89 B: [mn] well but do you think that ah religion 

127.98 133.74 B: should be the focus of religious school as opposed to public school 

135.15 137.51 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [lipsmack] well certainly in [sigh] [mn] )) 

137.66 139.79 A: in religious school 

140.30 143.71 A: [sigh] [noise] it can be more of a focus but i think there should be [sigh] [mn] 

144.91 146.74 A: a standard in 

146.77 148.93 A: [sigh] public school so that ah 

151.33 154.75 A: [sigh] so that ah there's a p- preservation of 

155.54 158.40 A: [sigh] of the ah moral teaching [mn] 

158.56 160.58 A: (( that ah [mn] )) 

161.59 164.07 A: the constitution is based on 

165.69 174.94 B: [sigh] oh i thought there's more problems just with making sure k- kids learn how to read and do basic math and 

175.13 180.52 A: [sigh] [sigh] [mn] well that is a problem [lipsmack] i think but i think it stems from 

176.99 177.92 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

181.24 182.92 A: [sigh] [noise] from moral decline 

183.20 186.13 A: [sigh] because the ah moral decline ah 

187.16 190.60 A: [sigh] because of moral decline there's an increase in sloth 

190.76 193.05 A: (( [sigh] there is less discipline )) 

193.47 197.11 A: [sigh] because the the deconstructionist's viewpoint ah 

198.63 201.65 A: [sigh] tears down the fabric of discipline [sigh] 

202.77 215.83 B: [sigh] [sigh] isn't a lot of that a result of [sigh] the high stress society where both parents work and there is less discipline because people don't have time or people are too willing to give into their children 'cause [sigh] 

215.99 219.19 B: they feel guilty that they're never home 

219.60 221.58 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [mn] yeah those are also )) 

219.79 221.90 B: [sigh] i think there are a lot of reasons 

221.69 222.81 A: [sigh] pardon me 

222.26 229.09 B: yeah i think there's just a lot of reasons i i it's like i don't want to b- blame [sigh] all of society's ills on 

224.44 225.45 A: yeah 

229.53 233.77 B: [sigh] on a lax moral view i mean i 

233.51 234.32 A: uh-huh 

234.06 235.95 B: i i just think 

236.02 239.42 B: problems are too complex and 

239.06 245.38 A: [sigh] well ye- yeah you're probably right it's not [mn] it's not all of that there's other f- factors like 

245.71 246.72 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

248.46 250.31 A: [mn] but i think the ah 

250.78 252.93 A: [sigh] the central 

254.19 255.74 A: ah factor in 

256.02 259.37 A: [mn] other problems is that ah moral decline 

259.87 263.72 A: [sigh] and one of the things is that [sigh] perhaps ah [mn] 

265.15 266.00 A: our e- 

267.12 268.57 A: our economy is 

268.82 271.20 A: is bad right now because of the ah [sigh] 

271.64 274.68 A: there's also a matter of moral decline when ah 

276.05 279.80 A: (( [sigh] [mn] when ah capitalism becomes )) 

280.45 282.29 A: gets to a point of being 

282.87 286.46 A: [sigh] so greedy that it doesn't look after [sigh] people [sigh] [sigh] 

287.84 294.28 B: [sigh] sure ah they're gonna to ship all the jobs overseas where it's cheaper t- to produce things and [sigh] 

291.53 292.80 A: yeah 

294.77 302.24 B: just so ah everyone can shop at walmart but no one will be able to afford walmart if all the jobs are shipped overseas 

299.70 301.35 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

301.68 309.43 A: [mn] and like you say that that means that both parents w- will end up working and [mn] [sigh] and they don't give enough attention to their children [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [noise] 

308.93 310.77 B: (( uh-hum )) 

311.11 313.28 B: yeah it just 

313.96 322.82 B: think you know and schools are under tighter budgets i think probably as you said a lot of the dedicated teachers ah 

323.07 324.16 B: (( [sigh] probably )) 

324.17 327.03 B: a a number of them are leaving the profession 

326.85 328.52 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] uh-hum )) 

327.56 328.87 B: (( u- um )) 

329.93 332.31 B: (( and )) 

332.39 339.36 B: ah [mn] it's probably hard to to motivate ah people entering the work force to to become teachers 

340.54 341.54 A: (( [sigh] yes )) 

344.04 345.32 A: (( [sigh] [noise] and ah [sigh] [mn] )) 

348.36 350.86 A: i think ah labor 

351.81 352.64 A: (( ah )) 

353.03 354.88 A: [mn] in america put up a 

355.09 356.93 A: [sigh] a hard struggle to ah 

357.72 362.49 A: [sigh] to get the kind of ah benefits that american workers expected but ah 

363.05 370.07 A: [lipsmack] by shipping labor out to countries w- where they even have slave labor that [mn] that's undercutting 

367.47 368.83 B: (( um uh-hum )) 

370.86 372.45 A: [mn] [sigh] and that ah 

372.46 376.23 A: [sigh] fair trade i think means that ah there's some protection 

376.51 379.57 A: that's a- a- ah that's ah being 

380.06 383.21 A: some of it presently is being lost 

382.37 384.13 B: yeah 

384.51 386.16 B: yeah i 

385.32 388.33 A: [sigh] [sigh] because yeah laissez faire does [sigh] 

388.98 393.88 A: um doesn't can never really exist purely and ah [sigh] 

394.63 396.05 A: because of 

396.29 398.24 A: business people ah [sigh] 

398.81 400.41 A: when they are organized 

400.72 408.18 A: and powerful can be s- stronger than the government itself and ah [mn] actually makes a quasi government 

407.16 408.94 B: (( uh-hum )) 

409.27 410.37 A: that ah 

412.30 415.24 A: [sigh] [mn] that ah has no checks and balances 

415.43 416.58 A: (( [sigh] it's ah )) 

418.24 422.04 A: (( [sigh] it just e- escapes the control of democracy [sigh] uh-hum [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

422.66 427.71 B: and our kids are suffering for that [noise] and um 

429.12 430.80 B: there's 

431.04 432.35 B: (( j- just )) 

432.47 441.29 B: [sigh] [noise] also a [sigh] i think a lot of emphasis too on i don't know about where you live but kids' days are 

441.49 444.41 B: so busy filled with soccer 

444.75 451.53 B: music and s- sports and other stuff that [sigh] i know when i was a kid we had homework and [laughter] 

444.77 446.17 A: uh-hum 

451.41 452.75 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] yeah )) 

451.99 454.66 B: you know it seems like maybe ah [sigh] 

455.12 466.81 B: kids just run from one activity to another and they have this m._t._v. generation where they always have to [sigh] do something new all the time and not just buckle down and 

465.86 468.48 A: [sigh] [sigh] [mn] well i think in my own experience ah [sigh] 

468.93 473.44 A: i didn't ah take enough advantage of extra curricula activities ah 

472.74 474.02 B: uh-hum 

474.67 478.03 A: [sigh] and ah i probably should have done more but yeah there's probably ah 

478.08 480.26 A: [sigh] are children that have too much 

480.08 487.27 B: yeah it probably was ah [sigh] it might have been the r- reverse before a- and and they are great because you do 

484.94 485.90 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

487.97 491.94 B: learn things like ah team work and 

491.33 492.37 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] uh-huh [sigh] [sigh] [noise] )) 

492.50 494.63 B: you get a sense of ah 

494.64 499.65 B: confidence and [mn] and ah you learn a different skill [sigh] 

499.93 500.97 B: um 

501.21 508.62 B: but i i do think sometimes it's too far when i see families that that just shuffle kids from one activity to another [sigh] 

508.99 510.79 B: and ah [sigh] 

509.94 511.02 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] uh-huh )) 

511.39 517.65 A: [mn] yeah a lot of times maybe those activities become a re- replacement for r- real family time 

516.64 519.67 B: right right 

519.76 521.92 B: (( [mn] and )) 

522.86 531.16 B: ah [mn] i also think you know ah part of the r- reason kids are not doing well is is that you know there's the high divorce rate and 

530.81 531.74 A: (( [sigh] uh-huh [sigh] )) 

531.55 540.28 B: [sigh] you know it it's hard to to concentrate at school when your parents are fighting or if you're missing one parent [sigh] 

540.80 541.83 B: um 

543.81 553.22 A: [noise] [mn] and i suppose regardless of all the ah underlying causes that we're talking about ah [sigh] somebody has to make a decision well this is the situation w- what can we do 

548.17 549.52 B: right 

553.21 553.96 B: (( uh-hum )) 

553.34 555.41 A: with the schools in particular 

555.17 556.10 B: (( uh-hum )) 

555.44 556.71 A: to try to 

556.77 562.45 A: [mn] make it the best it they can it can be for for the situation 

562.08 563.86 B: right 

564.29 565.17 B: [noise] i 

564.32 565.86 A: (( and ah [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

565.34 567.25 B: i think that um 

568.22 575.10 B: that people really do need to focus more on as a g- group effort on 

575.34 577.03 B: teaching kids 

577.32 588.37 B: [sigh] i i i don't think parents today are as involved in their kids' education a- and partially i guess because mom works now and she's not at home like she was in the past 

588.26 589.57 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum )) 

588.57 589.97 B: (( [sigh] um )) 

590.73 597.28 B: [lipsmack] and i i think people aren't i i think kids aren't treated to respect to elders 

597.34 599.89 B: or they're allowed to defy people 

598.49 599.84 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [mn] yeah ))
