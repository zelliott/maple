1.08 2.12 A: mike 

2.05 3.48 B: hey mike what's up man 

3.43 5.61 A: (( nothing much what is the topic )) 

4.34 9.68 B: well what is uh what was it uh family values and has divorce [sigh] 

9.97 16.01 B: altered the way you view something and uh that was all i caught 

16.09 17.73 A: all right um 

18.04 19.62 A: family values 

19.06 26.10 B: [sigh] family values and divorce has it affected you or changed any way the way you look at things or something to that effect and uh 

25.40 35.49 A: uh well firstly divorce uh well i've never experienced a divorce or in the family or had a divorce so uh i don't think 

33.40 33.96 B: (( [sigh] )) 

34.17 36.03 B: both your parents still married huh 

35.98 42.58 A: yeah both my parents are married so it really hasn't affected anything i think in society it's affected 

42.92 50.47 A: just the way people look at marriage just like when people go to a wedding i think in general they're like i wonder if these people are gonna get divorced 

49.32 60.46 B: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] mhm for sure [laughter] yeah i think what is it eighty two percent of uh married couples in this country end up divorced anyway it makes me cynical about the whole marriage thing myself 

56.96 58.01 A: yeah 

59.60 72.84 A: mhm i was at a wedding uh last wedding i was at [sigh] the uh priest was giving the sermon he asked uh did any anyone wish for anything and i go little kid and raised my hand and said i wish they don't get a divorce 

72.01 78.71 B: [sigh] [laughter] [laughter] so yeah i guess it has affected our society in general [sigh] 

78.77 80.50 B: uh i always 

80.38 91.33 B: [mn] it seems to be now that in at least in america i'm not sure about other countries that it's marriage is a semi disposable thing and it is i mean i'm that don't know if that's cynicism or reality but [sigh] 

91.11 100.80 B: uh my a- my belief is that a marriage is not what it was fifty years ago or maybe even a generation ago at least in this country would you agree with that or not 

99.06 99.98 A: (( yes [mn] )) 

100.40 102.90 A: i uh yeah i definitely agree with that it used to be 

103.03 105.78 A: a lot more people used to be married fifty years now if 

105.84 109.14 A: someone's married fifty years it's [mn] it's like a miracle [laughter] 

108.48 112.70 B: [sigh] it sure the hell is i'm a i'm a i am a divorcee so [sigh] 

112.70 117.41 B: i w- i have experienced it and i got married at a young age and um [lipsmack] 

117.41 126.05 B: within a few years we both realized that it was probably not the smartest thing to do so we divorced amicably [sigh] but uh it was a divorce and i st- 

125.98 140.97 B: again i it it seems to me that a lot of young people [sigh] yeah they they're married for a couple of years and then the shit hits the fan and they realize you know what [sigh] let's get out of this mess so it is it's an easier thing to do you can get married easily and you can get divorced easily so why not [mn] 

140.83 142.20 A: (( mhm )) 

141.99 149.03 B: [sigh] um [lipsmack] what else then i [mn] there was a second part to the there was another further statement to that qu- [sigh] 

148.10 152.42 A: well family values wasn't wasn't that some of the topic 

152.09 158.19 B: that was kinda like the general the general theme was the family values and it broke off into two further statements well 

156.82 158.62 A: yeah i don't know i don't 

158.91 171.31 A: family values are instilled when like at a young age but it's ju- still i don't think it enough i think it's more more friends values than uh the family values 

171.85 184.55 B: [sigh] i'm not even really sure what family value is except what's uh what's kinda plugged to us over the the different forms of media television and all that kinda stuff i don't even know what a family value is [sigh] treating your neighbors nicely or 

184.39 185.60 A: yeah that 

184.42 196.67 B: being honest and all that kinda stuff or [sigh] yeah i don't know if i don't know how how i learned any of that i don't think it was through my mom and my dad that's for sure [mn] i mean they taught me how to be polite 

186.18 187.02 A: yeah 

196.70 197.68 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

196.80 199.72 B: [mn] and they taught me what was right and what was wrong but [sigh] 

199.67 214.30 B: i don't even like i don't even like to chew the fat on the idea of family values especially as as it's drawn to us in the media now i remember like four or five years ago in america there was a big family values thing i don't know if it was 'cause george bush was elected president or what but [sigh] do you remember that or [sigh] 

214.22 218.52 B: especially like family values it was talking about a lot on t._v. and stuff like that [sigh] 

214.52 215.35 A: (( nah )) 

218.44 219.89 A: no not real well 

219.48 221.41 B: no [sigh] how old are you

230.62 239.14 B: [sigh] uh well what else can we say then [sigh] um [lipsmack] um um um um um [sigh] ten minutes to talk about a single subject like that huh 

239.40 240.42 A: yeah 

239.92 249.14 B: um you still live with your parents or not do they uh they try to instill in you anything you know the right the wrong thing to do what you should be doing [sigh] [sigh] 

242.83 244.79 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

248.32 250.51 A: yeah they used to they do but it's 

250.62 252.95 A: (( i don't know i'm old enough to make my own decisions )) 

252.97 254.87 B: what's that 

253.76 258.21 A: i said i'm old enough that i don't really even pay too much attention to them 

257.11 267.87 B: right what about uh marriage and stuff like that would they be happy to see you get married in the next year or two or they be like more happy for you to wait until you finished college and all the rest of it 

258.34 259.10 A: (( so )) 

267.07 270.06 A: yeah they probably be i don't know i think 

269.98 270.98 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

270.15 275.85 A: that's too much shit to deal i think it sh- i think it should happen at a later age when people are uh 

276.77 280.74 A: more mature and and just older and ready for it [mn] 

280.70 287.21 B: what do you think is your what what is the right ideal what is the right age for you did you think for marriage [mn] what would be a good age [sigh] 

287.68 290.16 A: i don't i don't think there really is a 

290.51 293.09 A: i think a steady j- steady job 

293.43 296.49 A: um doesn't need an age just when it all happens 

296.14 297.09 B: really 

296.54 298.92 A: just like steady job uh 

298.51 313.42 B: [sigh] would you let me ask you this if you gotta get two eighteen year old friends that said they were gonna get married and you had two [sigh] twenty nine year old friends that said they were gonna get married if you hadda put a thousand dollars down on which of the couples would last the longest who would you put it down on can't say 

313.40 314.84 B: or could you say 

315.33 319.58 A: uh i don't think you could really say it's like one of those individual 

319.82 323.08 A: things that all depends you know how well they click and 

322.56 324.04 B: [sigh] i guess so 

323.10 329.04 A: what their situation is but i mean if the the twenty nine year old's more prone to be done with school and 

324.52 325.54 B: (( [mn] i )) 

329.35 333.53 A: and just have a steadier job and everything like that 

332.86 336.22 B: [sigh] [sigh] and be more level head and stuff like that 

335.14 340.42 A: yeah and they and they just they just been through more just 'cause their age 

336.87 340.43 B: yeah 

340.24 351.09 B: i would um personally if i had a friend that was that young i would discourage them greatly from getting married at that such a young age eighteen in my opinion is is too young to do it but like you said there 

351.06 364.15 B: [mn] it does happen and it does work but [sigh] i would stay away from that at such a young age [sigh] i made the mistake myself i got married at the age of twenty and i was divorced by the time i was twenty three because i realized you know what i was too young to have done that 

356.81 357.74 A: mhm 

364.78 369.27 B: [sigh] but that's true different people different ages different results 

370.46 373.85 B: (( [mn] for sure [sigh] um [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

374.07 375.60 B: what else 

376.28 378.39 B: (( [sigh] wow um [sigh] )) 

379.45 382.06 B: i don't know anything else to fill in there mike [sigh] [sigh] 

382.32 383.62 A: uh about 

383.63 388.46 A: divorce uh i'm kinda interesting the in the divorce rate of uh 

388.61 389.65 A: (( of uh )) 

389.72 395.65 A: of like uh all those couples i'm in- wonder if their divorce rate's higher or lower 

395.96 405.66 B: well that's probably a good question but it i think they may have a hard time finding that one 'cause each of the all of our states have such str- strict laws on you know [sigh] can you even get married if you're gay 

406.02 407.11 A: (( yeah )) 

406.53 411.70 B: [sigh] you know what i'm saying i think only a few states that's even considered a true marriage 

407.73 408.72 A: i agree 

411.77 414.40 A: yeah the east ones like vermont and uh 

414.63 417.26 A: (( i don't know which other ones i'm that one in the news just )) 

417.45 425.80 B: yeah right [sigh] that's an interesting question though i'm looking around to see if i could find anything about divorce rates here on the internet but um [sigh] 

426.30 428.10 B: i can't really [sigh] 

426.79 428.43 A: wondering 'cause uh 

429.48 432.85 A: there it's always such a controversy in the news but i wonder if 

432.99 433.55 B: (( [sigh] )) 

433.05 436.32 A: the marriages last longer or 

435.90 438.74 B: yeah that's an interesting interesting thought 

439.53 440.19 B: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

440.59 443.00 B: (( yep like um [lipsmack] )) 

443.09 456.98 B: i don't know any gay couples that are married actually any married i have a few gay couple friends that have been together for many many years but [sigh] i'm in massachusetts and they don't consider it it's not legal here yet or it's not considered legal for gay people to get married [sigh] 

445.44 446.37 A: (( i )) 

457.32 459.40 B: it's not recognized [sigh] i'm 

460.13 461.58 B: not sure though 

461.25 462.94 A: don't think it's recognized here 

462.91 464.30 B: what's that [sigh] 

463.65 466.22 A: it's not recognized here in allentown either 

465.22 467.24 B: [sigh] in pennsylvania 

466.27 467.85 A: in pennsylvania 

467.59 472.37 B: no [sigh] i can well believe that i believe that i don't know if it is in california either [sigh] 

472.80 477.59 B: even though it probably should be out there [sigh] [mn] [lipsmack] um 

477.60 480.36 B: is this your first call you've taken on this thing or not 

479.73 480.74 A: yeah 

480.45 484.43 B: it is and it's my first one as well they tried me a bunch of times last week 

484.70 488.88 B: [sigh] but uh like i say on one of the occasions i couldn't hear what the computer said and [sigh] 

489.68 493.85 A: yeah i couldn't i just caught the end of it or the beginning of it 

493.51 499.31 B: yeah i think i might email them and let them know that their computer voice system is not that clear 

500.01 504.56 B: (( [sigh] but um [lipsmack] um let me see )) 

505.59 510.12 B: [sigh] they got a little thing here divorce rates for specific u._s. states 

510.86 515.01 B: be interesting to see it state by state if it's much different 

514.65 517.98 A: i think that divorce is rough on the kids too it affects them 

517.98 528.42 B: oh yeah [sigh] my parents got divorced when i was uh ten years old was living overseas in germany and they both got divorced and i would say that it [sigh] 

528.56 539.78 B: i definitely it definitely affected my view [mn] of marriage and of parenting and the rest of it um i'm a definite a divorcee pr- i'm a product of a divorce [sigh] 

539.82 546.83 B: um i think i was probably angry as a kid too because of it but i'm also very cynical about marriage right now 

546.96 551.38 B: [sigh] i mean i think it's a good i don't have any problem with other people getting married but myself i don't [sigh] 

551.57 557.19 B: i'm in no hurry to get married i'm thirty four and if i never got married again that'd be okay with me [sigh] 

557.40 561.19 B: i don't know if that's a direct result of my parents getting divorced or not but [sigh] [lipsmack] 

561.97 563.49 B: who the hell knows 

564.27 566.02 B: i'm not sure 

564.60 566.20 A: (( right ))
