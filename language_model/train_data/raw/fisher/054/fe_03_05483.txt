19.47 24.61 B: it goes by pretty fast and [laughter] yeah what do you think of drug testing 

20.88 22.90 A: really okay 

24.06 27.53 A: well i think uh obviously the uh more 

27.56 29.17 A: (( uh [sigh] )) 

30.12 33.00 A: more specialized or more uh 

33.55 37.12 A: dangerous the industry in the the more important it becomes 

36.51 47.57 B: yeah yeah i think it's important for um you know like people that have uh like drivers you know somebody tired on the road a delivery driver or something like that is you know any 

47.59 51.61 B: heavy equipment stuff you know things like that i think it's important 

51.20 57.54 A: well then then you got the whole you know medical profession law enforcement uh 

56.72 58.21 B: yeah yeah yep 

57.63 58.74 A: (( you know thing )) 

59.00 67.64 A: people that uh are responsible for making life and death decisions you know obviously don't want them uh [noise] under the influence [noise] [noise] 

66.67 68.01 B: that's for sure 

68.15 82.67 B: i don't feel you know it's an invasion of privacy or anything either because you know i i think it is important uh not only uh for that person but also you know people that he works around you know if i'm working for somebody that you know is on drugs or 

82.47 83.85 B: or something you know they 

84.08 87.21 B: it makes it kind of unsafe for everybody you know 

86.28 95.37 A: [noise] [lipsmack] well uh yeah and i think the people that feel that it's invasion of privacy are the ones that [noise] typically have something to hide [laughter] 

94.38 97.29 B: yeah that's probably true yeah 

95.43 97.11 A: [laughter] 

97.30 99.05 B: no doubt about it 

98.04 105.61 A: so have you had any experi- uh have you had any uh managerial experience where that has become an issue for you 

105.14 111.67 B: well i'm a manager now so we uh we test all of our drivers you know we do it uh randomly and um 

108.76 110.73 A: (( [noise] okay uh-huh [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

111.44 121.04 B: you know it's unannounced i m- i mean they know that they can be at any time and i think that right there's a good idea just letting them know you know 

113.29 114.19 A: uh-huh 

121.13 129.65 B: uh i mean there's some people that uh you know you might go by two years before you get drug tested but they never know i mean they can go into work tomorrow and uh we can call 'em in 

130.12 135.32 B: you know we send 'em up to a medical uh place up the road and they get tested you know 

134.75 135.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

135.43 137.43 B: so they never know they you know 

137.69 144.74 B: uh it keeps them on their toes more or less keeps 'em makes 'em think twice about you know if they were gonna do any drugs 

145.12 149.85 A: [noise] do you think that helps uh in- improve performance for the for your business 

149.46 155.61 B: yeah i think it does um you know we we i've got eleven drivers and we um 

153.40 154.40 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

154.42 155.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

155.65 157.70 B: you know got some got employees there 

157.78 162.16 B: and we've never had one yet and i've been doing this for eight years now 

161.68 162.70 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

162.17 165.80 B: we've never had one that tested uh you know positive 

165.35 166.63 A: right 

166.26 170.17 B: so we've uh we got some good people there but you know you never know 

167.48 168.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

169.82 170.63 A: uh-huh 

170.31 175.42 B: whenever we hire a new uh employee you know we always drug test them first too you know 

174.62 175.94 A: (( [noise] [noise] sure )) 

175.59 177.30 B: yeah it's part of their um 

177.38 178.87 B: hiring process 

178.11 179.23 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

179.84 189.87 A: yeah i work at a financial institution and we have drug testing uh when you're hired as well um and they say that 

186.26 187.27 B: right 

190.36 192.69 A: there's random testing but i 

193.41 197.59 A: can't ever remember in the ten years that i've been there that 

197.62 199.94 A: i've ever heard of anybody tested again 

197.74 198.65 B: yeah 

200.38 210.54 B: yeah we we send like one guy every three months or so you know roughly three to four months we'll send somebody down just to let 'em know that we do do it [laughter] 

204.35 205.24 A: uh-huh 

210.71 212.27 B: (( it uh [mn] )) 

212.42 215.40 B: keeps them on their toes i think it's a very good idea 

212.58 213.20 A: (( [noise] )) 

215.62 222.61 B: i think almost every company no matter where you work at any more you know upon hiring i think they all drug test nowadays 

222.86 224.35 A: yeah it's it's 

224.42 226.78 A: gotten to be more commonplace 

226.47 231.26 B: yeah yeah but it's a it's a good idea 

231.34 232.88 A: the um 

233.59 238.26 A: i i guess it is that for your business that helps with your uh insurance 

237.99 247.14 B: oh yeah as a matter of fact it's uh our insurance um mandate that we have to drug test upon hiring anyway you know they don't uh 

246.31 247.52 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

246.97 260.97 B: say anything about the random drug testing but upon hiring yeah they have to you know go through the drug testing or they go through a complete background check you know their license and all that stuff but the insurance company requires that that every 

260.87 263.58 B: driver be drug tested upon hiring 

262.39 265.10 A: (( [noise] [noise] huh [mn] [noise] )) 

264.38 267.18 B: it uh keeps our rates a little lower you know they 

267.78 272.21 A: but they but they don't require or give you any breaks for doing it more than 

272.62 284.93 B: no they they never said anything about the random you know they they know that we do it but it's not a requirement for them as far as i know anyway you know it's it uh i know i know it is upon hiring that's 

272.96 273.78 A: [noise] 

277.55 278.43 A: uh-huh 

279.52 280.36 A: huh 

285.34 287.57 B: (( the only thing i know for sure but )) 

285.87 286.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

286.85 287.58 A: (( huh )) 

288.22 294.24 B: it's it's a good idea especially you know we got drivers out that drive all over the place you know and uh 

294.84 301.95 B: we've had a few of 'em over my eight years you know we've had a couple of people that got into accidents and that's another thing that we do 

302.02 306.36 B: you know when when they get into an accident that's they get drug tested at the hospital 

305.90 307.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] oh really )) 

306.82 308.63 B: yeah it doesn't matter how 

308.77 311.55 B: major or how you know minor it is 

310.99 311.95 A: uh-huh 

311.63 313.98 B: that's another requirement that we have you know that's 

314.66 316.36 B: just something we do 

316.40 327.41 B: 'cause they even do that for the employees that work in the in the plant you know they if somebody has an industrial accident they get drug tested just a company policy 

321.81 322.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

327.00 331.02 A: [noise] and and and again i guess that's just to protect yourselves [noise] 

330.39 339.32 B: yeah uh-huh yeah yeah and you never know you know sometimes you know maybe somebody might be on drugs and that's the reason why they had the accident you know 

338.59 340.51 A: right [noise] 

339.40 340.13 B: (( so )) 

340.40 343.36 B: that's another insurance requirement 

343.80 345.41 A: [noise] wow 

345.24 346.52 B: yeah 

346.31 350.32 A: guess it uh i i guess in today's day and age it's 

351.37 354.31 A: [sigh] become more of a mis- necessity than 

354.10 360.26 B: yeah i think it really is yeah i don't think i've uh i've never seen a company i don't know 

360.33 364.58 B: you know you look at jobs in the paper and stuff they they all say drug testing you know 

363.81 365.16 A: (( [noise] right )) 

364.79 369.39 B: i think i think just about every company does that any more no matter what kind of a job it is 

370.00 372.58 B: but uh i think it's a good idea 

372.23 387.15 A: [noise] i can you know i w- when i got my first job and i was telling my father that i was [noise] getting drug [noise] tested he said when you know he was running his business that he saw it as an added expense you know twenty years ago 

385.94 387.94 B: myself yeah right 

387.36 388.70 A: and now it's 

389.27 392.29 A: [noise] like you said for insurance purposes a necessity 

391.85 398.57 B: yeah well it cost us i don't know what the total is it it's somewhere around a hundred and fifty dollars 

398.71 402.01 B: uh [mn] you know every time we send somebody up there to be drug tested 

401.35 402.78 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

402.42 404.14 B: so it is an expense 

404.57 407.94 B: i mean uh i i could understand [laughter] that 

407.95 411.08 B: uh i don't have to pay for it so [laughter] 

409.59 412.06 A: [noise] right right right 

411.82 420.77 B: but it it is i mean anything medical any more you know is expensive you know and you send somebody up there you know they give 'em the blood test and then the breathalyzer and um 

421.93 427.85 B: uh uh i forget what else is involved in it oh the piss test they do that and it it costs money you 

424.43 425.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

427.13 429.71 A: (( [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

428.91 432.27 B: know twenty years ago you never heard of drug testing 

430.01 431.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

432.29 436.07 A: no well and it wasn't it wasn't as 

436.23 438.93 A: commonplace in society as it is today 

438.50 444.47 B: yeah it just wasn't as uh out in the open i think back then as it is now and uh 

439.14 439.70 A: (( [noise] )) 

445.55 453.00 B: [sigh] it's a big concern of employers nowadays back twenty thirty years ago it wasn't even a concern with employees 

446.07 447.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

451.20 452.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

453.72 456.25 B: and probably half of 'em were on drugs too 

455.75 458.53 A: [laughter] 

457.08 462.16 B: especially back in the sixties and seventies you know like that was commonplace back then 

458.61 459.77 A: (( yeah )) 

462.41 464.64 A: yeah it's amazing how it it's 

465.09 470.90 A: gone from one one extreme to the other from acceptance to almost taboo 

470.62 483.32 B: yeah yeah i've uh you know back in the sixties you know i experimented around with it you know but i it's that was the last time i ever fooled around with any kinds of drugs you know 

483.88 487.57 B: and uh that was just a thing of growing up back in the sixties 

486.90 488.57 A: (( [noise] right )) 

488.17 494.07 B: and uh you know i don't i don't do any of that i drink occasional beer now and then but that's about it [laughter] 

493.43 498.56 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well nothing [noise] yeah i mean that's just a second jake that uh 

499.99 503.23 A: even now you see [noise] you know that 

503.44 508.79 A: with the uh drunk driving and driving under the influence i mean even that has 

508.66 509.74 B: yeah 

509.16 511.15 A: gotten to new levels 

510.50 512.00 B: oh it sure has 

512.69 520.88 B: yeah nowadays i got a friend of mine that uh he stopped now this is about two months ago he stopped and had uh four draught beers after work 

520.12 522.16 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

521.04 523.97 B: and he got pulled over on his way home and he was over the limit 

523.11 523.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

524.43 525.88 B: four draught beers 

525.51 526.54 A: wow 

527.17 534.39 B: and uh it doesn't take much any more i think the alcohol level now is what zero point eight 

533.02 536.50 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

534.89 536.31 B: point zero eight 

536.64 540.60 B: they say that you know for a a smaller guy you know that's a couple of beers 

536.94 539.64 A: (( yeah )) 

541.30 549.38 B: and this guy was about a hundred and ninety pounds and he drank four draught beers and it put him over the limit he got a d._u._i. for it [laughter] yeah that's 

542.28 544.28 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

548.68 549.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

551.05 552.72 B: felt bad for him [sigh] 

552.43 554.08 A: expensive four beers 

553.73 566.69 B: yeah it sure is it ended up costing him over two thousand dollars with a lawyer and he even lost his license now he's going to i guess you know when his if his hearing comes up that's you know that's the reason why they 

564.34 565.20 A: uh-huh 

566.86 568.48 B: do all this drug testing i 

567.08 571.35 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

570.50 574.37 B: guess you guys you say you do the random testing where you work 

573.42 579.95 A: [noise] well they tell us they do but i i mean we don't i i don't know of anybody that ever 

575.70 576.52 B: yeah 

580.00 587.01 A: has had a random test unless they were suspicious of their performance or 

581.36 582.26 B: yeah 

586.46 588.17 B: right 

587.38 588.47 A: (( you know )) 

588.29 599.89 B: yeah a lot of companies use that you know if they um feel that uh maybe this employee isn't um pulling his weight not doing his job properly there's a lot of companies will use that they'll send him in and
