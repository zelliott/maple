211.80 213.50 A: (( huh [mn] )) 

213.72 221.54 B: you know authors that are not considered appropriate which is kinda so if you if you're going to be 

215.49 216.05 A: (( [mn] )) 

218.82 219.99 A: huh 

221.82 223.04 A: (( huh )) 

221.96 232.13 B: having people in in society you know what i'm saying it's kind of you know would like it for them to be able to make their own decisions right 

224.82 225.94 A: uh-huh 

227.41 228.38 A: uh-huh 

229.91 230.99 A: (( uh-huh )) 

231.02 242.28 A: yeah yeah well not that i'm agreeing with it but i guess it does get into uh you know the age thing again you know uh are they old enough to make that decision and uh 

242.17 249.52 B: well some little fourth grader is not going to be reading you know catcher in the rye or you know it it's 

242.40 243.46 A: (( uh )) 

250.09 250.88 A: (( [mn] )) 

250.23 252.24 B: there's not gonna be 

252.43 253.47 B: (( so )) 

253.83 255.02 B: you know 

254.23 261.42 A: huh [mn] [mn] yeah but if that's in the school library they they they will be exposed to that and some kids who are [sigh] 

255.50 256.92 B: but um 

261.50 269.32 A: maybe fourth grade but very high you know very high i._q.s if they have access you know as i say in the school library there's certain 

264.09 266.71 B: mhm 

270.98 277.79 B: well i mean and like there's also to the point like well the the school um 

272.22 272.78 A: (( [sigh] )) 

278.10 286.13 B: can make the decision to what books they're gonna have in their library so that they wouldn't even have even have access to it [mn] if the people 

280.86 281.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

283.40 283.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

283.86 289.43 A: uh-huh well you know i don't know i think uh [mn] you get kids at a certain age 

289.29 300.88 A: [sigh] you know certain do you think maybe [mn] you know if they're so say a sixth seventh grade they they maybe can read something that somebody might not be appropriate for someone and in uh second or third grade 

300.75 304.59 A: you think uh trying to shut above that uh 

301.06 302.72 B: mhm 

306.52 307.96 B: (( [mn] )) 

307.08 313.13 A: but then i guess [sigh] the second or third i guess the teacher instructors uh would be 

313.61 315.96 A: you know reading or you know 

316.08 320.46 A: teaching or reading certain books to the class so 

320.87 322.74 A: as composed to 

324.70 325.74 A: you know 

326.33 331.15 A: they they you know so like second or third grade a teach- teacher probably wouldn't be you know 

331.43 341.38 A: yeah talking about the catcher in the rye that that you know they wouldn't probably have the tests or assign them to read that at that level 

332.93 336.83 B: mhm 

339.61 346.00 B: well hopefully they'd be able to read in second or third grade [laughter] 

343.87 346.67 A: [mn] probably they will but uh 

346.52 357.94 B: really depends what really depends which which neighborhood which which area they live in new york um and it really depends then because you know 

347.16 347.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

353.24 354.33 A: (( uh-huh )) 

355.85 356.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

358.38 363.50 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

358.90 363.90 B: [mn] really it wo- and public schools uh they're 

364.55 376.54 A: uh-huh [mn] yeah it was really it's kinda a debatable subject because [mn] yeah yeah 'cause that was a really good point you're saying i don't know something about like [sigh] like i'm a you know white person i mean like uh 

366.38 368.39 B: you know not gonna be 

376.89 380.67 A: i'm in a rough area here and [mn] in new york 

380.82 394.39 A: it's like kids early on shouldn't have knowledge of drug addiction and drug dealers and avoid them or something and maybe in the suburbs and jersey it might not be necessary kids at [sigh] [mn] 

385.25 388.54 B: mhm 

394.46 397.14 A: you know there's not really gonna be exposed to 

397.96 405.19 A: uh certain type lifestyles and maybe it's not necessary so much for them you know something like that you know so i 

402.42 403.82 B: yeah i mean 

405.04 418.67 B: got the whole different point of of of you know different types of of of of sense of knowledge that kids have someone brought up in the suburbs 

418.58 431.46 B: has a totally different sense of uh you know sense of someone you know brought up here in you know in the bronx or you know it and some you know the bronx or whatever the 

421.25 422.38 A: uh-huh 

426.33 428.00 A: yeah 

431.47 442.88 B: you know have smarts that you know and the street sense and whatever that and a whole different way of of you know pretty much looking 

434.99 436.11 A: uh-huh 

436.94 437.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

442.68 445.20 A: right right 

443.23 443.89 B: (( at )) 

444.07 446.25 B: than someone from the suburbs 

445.85 449.92 A: (( uh-huh you know if somebody grew up the ghettos or something you know )) 

446.62 447.87 B: (( and so )) 

450.27 456.25 B: so someone you know someone reading something in in the suburbs 

450.30 451.35 A: but uh 

455.90 456.87 A: uh-huh 

456.45 457.53 B: you know 

457.58 458.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

458.72 465.20 B: it what what can they have in in reading a certain book will be totally different than someone reading 

464.14 466.99 A: yeah yeah get my point i think if you're 

468.43 470.15 A: (( [sigh] there should be )) 

470.09 474.43 A: educated i guess as kids of the ghetto drug dealers and stuff 

474.28 484.81 A: should be maybe educated about those kinda goings on to avoid them as composed to [sigh] someone in the suburbs maybe they won't be you know they probably won't be all [mn] 

484.62 496.04 A: at a certain early age or you know be exposed to them so maybe you could wait later to tell them about pimps and whores and [laughter] you know that kinda thing um 

492.61 493.28 B: (( in )) 

496.10 500.99 A: (( it's very interesting um i mean as i was talking i'm n- [mn] i'm no oracle either you know i go to you )) 

500.80 514.34 A: know i take a lot of videos in the library [sigh] and some of 'em i'm amazed uh that are in the library you know you only gonna see certain kind of movies and i'm kinda like curious sometime as to what's and 

514.11 526.01 A: some some movies i've considered raunchy that were out you know yet they would be at the library [sigh] and there may be other movies i saw i thought more educated [mn] more educational or 

526.09 532.53 A: [sigh] um that they would not be i could never find in the library so [sigh] i don't know so i'm wondering you know 

532.91 536.55 A: oh the library what system they use to [sigh] 

536.75 538.27 A: to you know 

539.07 543.48 A: put movies if you know in a [mn] who picks these films 

543.60 545.01 A: (( i don't know what oh )) 

545.45 548.50 A: i'm sure you know library they like kids 

545.92 546.72 B: (( [mn] mm )) 

549.44 555.60 A: i'm sure there's a [sigh] you know censor or kinda system you know 

555.96 557.58 A: they use so 

560.52 567.04 B: (( yeah )) 

561.71 562.29 A: (( [mn] )) 

566.12 567.16 A: um 

567.83 569.61 A: yeah i don't know it's um 

569.63 571.16 B: [mn] 

570.04 573.15 A: [lipsmack] very very debatable kinda subject uh [sigh] 

573.36 575.01 A: i think uh 

575.11 580.87 A: i don't think people should be forced you know just like in religion and prayer and all that the the 

580.93 586.15 A: i think if they choose to want to do that they should be allowed 

586.18 599.89 A: i'm [mn] prayer but at the same time if somebody wants to read my a kid wants to know about whores and prostitutes and [sigh] you know and x. you know no that shouldn't be available until a certain age [laughter]
