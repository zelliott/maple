156.71 161.32 A: yeah yeah it's i- it's actually fun on the com- well it's it's the same as playing it u- um 

161.41 166.15 A: (( w- u- uh just normally but it's actually fun on the computer )) 

166.17 177.24 A: 'cause uh on- once once uh once you win you uh the the screen shows you um where the other where the boats were and stuff like that so yeah it's cool 

175.25 176.07 B: uh-huh 

176.44 186.29 B: i don't think i've ever played sin- especially since i've never played battleship on the computer i don't think i've ever played without cheating [laughter] 'cause you can i 

184.03 187.60 A: yeah yeah me too [laughter] i used to [mn] 

186.35 191.87 B: you can usually figure out a little bit like where their boats are but just by looking around or whatever 

191.27 198.13 A: yeah you can you can that's well that's why i like it i can i always win [laughter] yeah 

196.24 207.00 B: yeah yeah but uh what do they do on the on the computer game to pr- to prevent you from uh like is there any way to cheat or because i know in spades like you could feasibly cheat 

205.13 215.21 A: there is there is um like all the computer games i i i know i know y- with yahoo um and with uh a._o._l. you can ch- you can cheat with their games 'cause 

215.21 228.06 A: um you can use two screen names um using [mn] the first one to a- a- as as as you playing the other person and then using the third the the the third screen name to check on the table 

223.93 224.89 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

228.26 239.56 A: the third screen name when you use that screen name to check on the table it actually allows you to see the other person's cards and stuff like that so you you sometimes you actually know if it's a card game you actually know like what cards they have 

239.40 240.88 B: oh yeah 

239.68 245.20 A: um yeah and uh if you're playing with someone else like you're you're you're partnering with someone 

245.04 246.12 B: mhm 

245.08 252.78 A: you can actually use four screen names using the other two to play and then using the other two to tell your- to tell yourself o- or to play or know to tell like 

252.58 260.27 A: how how many cards you have what kind of what kind of cards you have and stuff like that so y- yeah there's a lot of ways to cheat on a computer game 

259.69 267.73 B: oh oh yes that's the one problem i have with uh internet computer games is that if you're gonna play um 

260.54 261.78 A: yeah 

267.79 269.38 B: like some of those i mean 

269.29 279.22 B: i used to play counterstrike which is an an internet game and there's there is there's so many people that played it plus they made money off selling um 

275.53 276.66 A: mhm 

279.03 285.14 B: the game it was based on but they actually spent a lot of time trying to um prevent cheating 

285.07 286.00 A: oh 

285.20 289.24 B: and they did a pretty good job but yahoo doesn't um 

289.45 294.21 B: doesn't really have to care too much about cheating as long as they get people to play 

293.70 295.26 A: yeah yeah that's true [noise] 

295.21 297.27 B: and i mean uh 

297.55 308.06 B: if people are i think less likely if you're playing with yahoo because a lot of the games are free and they're probably a lot more serious about um about cheating on the ones that you actually have to pay for 

308.92 313.94 A: yeah i i i yeah of course um they have these um these other games uh [noise] 

314.38 322.53 A: for for yahoo but with another with another company or other internet site it's called uh white glass or something like that and then you have to pay 

320.74 321.57 B: (( mhm )) 

322.70 323.62 A: um 

323.48 334.17 A: they actually give you five dollars to start uh playing the games and then once you once you've lost all your money then you have to deposit money to it using your credit card 

333.74 334.56 B: (( uh-huh )) 

334.01 343.02 A: um yes that those those cards it it's very hard to cheat it's very i i mean i've never cheated on them 'cause there's no way i can cheat on them 

342.84 349.34 A: um but i i i guess someone out there probably knows something one or two about cheating on those games 

349.08 351.98 B: yeah probably yeah i have um 

350.06 351.04 A: yeah 

352.57 367.54 B: yeah i have a friend who does a lot of like uh online gambling and stuff like that and uh he always says it's a lot of fun but personally i don't i mean are you know internet may be fun but uh not with my own money hell no 

357.59 358.89 A: yeah 

367.53 373.99 A: (( yeah i i've done i've done internet gambling once or once or twice i'm a big [laughter] i'm a gambler )) 

374.06 375.07 A: um

406.23 408.85 A: i play first card poker or seven 

407.82 408.56 B: (( oh )) 

408.74 409.93 B: mhm 

409.29 410.62 A: yeah 

410.21 418.25 B: i don't see i i would never uh i never played much poker so i never really knew many games and um 

419.66 433.94 B: i uh actually um o- one of the places where i work they but they my boss just goes next door and plays poker all day long and there's so many poker games that like that i i've never even heard of before 

432.86 436.97 A: yeah there's there's um in america there's seven poker games 

437.52 441.08 A: uh well there's seven recognized poker games 

440.76 441.74 B: yeah 

441.11 456.08 A: there's the the oklahoma uh uh then there's the and then there's the five um the first card poker then there's the seven card poker then the nine card poker and then there's the um uh 

456.14 458.47 A: (( the other one i d- i i d- )) 

457.53 459.10 B: texas hold 'em 

458.55 469.89 A: (( yeah which i never play um the the the only two i play is the is the first card and the seven card um i don't play the the the ones with that started with state names um )) 

464.95 465.77 B: mhm 

469.96 471.48 A: 'cause they're more complicated 

471.97 477.42 B: texas hold 'em is uh is the only game that i've seen anybody 

472.06 472.95 A: (( uh )) 

477.49 484.35 B: um any any of my friends play online and that's uh by way of gambling that's supposed to be one of 

484.30 495.39 B: one of the better uh poker games i think it's where you've got two cards um like the you get two cards uh 

488.02 489.10 A: yeah 

495.50 497.54 B: face face down 

496.57 497.94 A: (( [noise] face down )) 

497.78 510.19 B: and then um they put so and then so you you ante and then you get your two cards and then you bet once and then they throw down 

510.43 512.05 B: uh 

513.01 516.51 B: one card and then um 

517.22 528.53 B: you bet again and i think i think overall they put four cards face up on the table so you get to use three of tho- three of any of those cards and then the two cards that you're holding 

529.09 538.62 B: and usually w- it usually whether or not you win is based on just what you were dealt in those two cards like if you get if you get bad cards you 

538.58 545.60 B: like if you get a a two and a four and they're not the same suit then you just fold all automatically because it doesn't make any sense to 

544.61 547.24 A: mhm to to carry on playing 

546.79 549.49 B: to wade through yeah but if you get um 

548.04 548.88 A: mhm 

549.51 558.71 B: you know if you get like let's say two tens that's that's a pretty decent hand um so you might stay in a little bit longer but occasionally 

551.27 552.24 A: (( ten )) 

553.04 554.62 A: yeah 

558.55 567.53 B: uh someone could just be lucky off the flop and get like let's say they have a seven and an eight of the same suit and they could just be lucky and end up with uh 

565.16 566.16 A: (( mhm stay )) 

567.47 579.29 B: with a flush um with the cards coming down it's just a matter of like how how long you're willing to just stay in the game and how much money you're willing to risk to get a good hand 

574.76 576.11 A: in the game to stay 

576.66 577.45 A: (( in )) 

578.75 586.36 A: yeah the the the texas hold 'em is al- is almost it's no- not the same but almost the same as the the oklahoma holdem 

586.38 593.42 A: um but the the texas holdem is more to me it seems more like the the first card poker 

593.33 594.36 B: uh-huh 

593.59 599.95 A: uh 'cause in the first card poker you you get um the dealer deals you five cards um over
