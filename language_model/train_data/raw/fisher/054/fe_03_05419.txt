193.61 194.32 B: (( [mn] [laughter] ))

251.01 253.80 A: [noise] it can sure make it a lot easier 

254.03 262.04 A: like i have a friend or not a friend [laughter] a cousin and she truly is a millionaire and you know she doesn't have a lot of friends and everybody 

258.42 259.26 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

262.06 275.79 A: and she kind of keeps them away because everybody knows she's wealthy they're always trying to hit her up trying to get a loan from her trying to get money and so i'm sure she doesn't have a lot of friends but i don't really think that bothers her [laughter] 

266.32 267.21 B: uh-huh 

274.35 276.32 B: (( yeah [laughter] mhm )) 

275.93 282.78 A: 'cause she's so busy getting her nails done getting a pedicure getting her hair done [laughter] you know

294.96 297.16 A: but i definitely don't think she's lonely 

297.30 303.41 B: no- -nother thing is some people are content to be by themselves and they don't care and some people have to have people around 

301.01 302.21 A: yeah 

302.85 304.22 A: exactly 

303.84 306.36 B: yeah i i don't need people i can 

305.03 306.30 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] ))

344.15 349.66 B: yeah they i know there's like a ten thousand dollar gift one but am i gonna get taxed on the rest of i 

349.63 351.33 A: (( [noise] exactly [noise] )) 

349.89 351.47 B: (( might have to reconsider )) 

352.40 353.35 B: (( but man )) 

352.48 353.49 A: but um
