8.13 10.50 A: oh okay i've done it one other time 

9.92 11.53 B: okay yeah me too so 

11.16 14.84 A: um i guess it's public schools we're supposed to talk about 

14.21 24.83 B: yeah so uh what do you i guess you could start off uh what do you think is wrong with the uh you think there's some- something wrong with the public school system and if so [noise] what can we do to fix it man [noise] 

22.42 23.23 A: well 

23.79 29.10 A: uh well yeah i'm kind of on on the outskirts of this issue 'cause i don't have children 

28.35 36.57 B: [noise] [noise] okay [noise] [noise] no neither do i but i mean i've [noise] i've attended public school system so so i kind of have a 

29.47 31.24 A: uh do you have children 

34.20 35.32 A: okay 

36.08 37.37 A: uh 

36.60 37.91 B: hands on 

37.39 42.28 A: well i i think that the school system does have some kind of a problem [laughter] 

41.63 42.78 B: yeah me too 

42.58 53.94 A: and uh i don't know if it starts with the accounta- i think the teachers used to feel like they should be accountable now i feel like teachers don't feel like they wanna be obligated to be 

49.08 49.92 B: mm 

54.51 59.17 A: uh accountable for the children because when they are they only get stepped on by the parents 

58.72 60.59 B: right 

60.16 63.26 A: and so how do you solve that problem i don't know 

63.28 66.43 B: yeah that's a precarious one isn't it 

65.27 69.73 A: uh yes so if you're a childr- if you're a teacher 

69.86 71.67 A: what direction do you go in 

72.26 74.67 B: i mean how much power i mean [mn] [noise] 

74.35 77.43 A: i don't think that money should be the issue because 

78.06 79.98 A: uh different states 

79.83 93.97 A: i mean real estate is different in different parts of the country the value is different there's different ethnic groups in different parts of the united states and you know so as far as payroll you know some states can afford to pay more than others just like in corporations 

82.40 83.23 B: (( mm )) 

86.25 88.30 B: (( [noise] mm [noise] )) 

94.28 97.95 B: yeah but i mean i i on on a whole i think that teachers are 

98.04 107.66 B: drastically underpaid i mean there's there i mean when you go from a public school system to a private school system it's just no competition and there's no there's no contest because 

107.54 114.23 B: a lot i a lot of uh professors that are teachers i had when i was in public school um they were they were 

114.22 126.06 B: you know starting to end their their time with with the public school system in favor of ge- of getting [noise] of getting better pay in private schools and and dealing with less of the problems that you know 

126.67 130.16 B: that had [mn] come come about from from the students you know 

129.96 139.37 B: [noise] and from and from the parents as well [noise] [noise] [noise] n- 

130.07 131.12 A: okay s- 

131.46 139.10 A: okay so basically the ste- the teachers get paid more in private schools because the because the parents are more responsible for their children 

139.36 152.06 B: not necessarily just that the private school [noise] system is they're they have set up a [noise] they have they they putting more value on on the teachers and their their influence on on the students whereas 

151.96 159.52 B: you know um public school systems i think c- can can really take 'em or you know take 'em or leave 'em as far as they don't really i mean 

155.21 155.99 A: they 

159.57 171.98 B: there's such a push right now for for teachers everywhere and if you look at what a teacher gets paid versus you know a garbage man or something it's not even you know it's a joke i mean these guys some people can't even hardly live on o- off their uh 

168.80 170.02 A: i don't know public 

171.37 172.78 A: what state are you living in 

172.29 175.01 B: i live in new york city 

173.98 179.29 A: oh new york state teachers get paid seventy thousand dollars a year to teach school that's not that's 

178.16 184.27 B: well that's after so many years of of teaching i mean i think they'd have to be teaching for like twenty years or something 

184.14 187.32 A: well yeah and they go down to florida and they make thirty 

186.83 188.21 B: really 

188.13 196.90 A: and what they do is they sell their house up in new york they go down and they pay cash for a house in florida and uh they can be a substitute teacher but uh 

197.38 200.69 A: they can't afford to live in florida on thirty thousand dollars a year 

200.28 201.43 B: of course 

201.15 204.63 A: but they're making twice as much in new york as they are in florida 

205.01 209.12 B: [laughter] it's amazing though i mean um but here in new york city i 

209.12 223.98 B: you know i've i've spoken to and have i obviously i went to public school system and then i as i've had friends who have uh become teachers or friends who i've known or met to be who have been teachers and they they get paid sometimes you know 

224.77 230.59 B: may they might make twenty thousand dollars in their you know first three four five years you know and that's 

230.66 237.03 B: for new york city it's the cost of living is w- is very high so it's not really a whole lot of money i mean they're not really doing 

237.05 241.09 B: too well a lot lot have second second jobs and it's really 

237.17 237.94 A: (( well i )) 

240.69 244.42 A: why wouldn't those teachers go ahead and get jobs in private schools then 

244.33 247.76 B: exactly and then then but then that's why 

248.23 254.00 B: we're s- [mn] swamped with like okay they're like advertising you know all over the place 

254.16 265.62 B: you know we need teachers public schools you know we recommend this we'll do this we'll do that and the teachers j- [noise] they just jump at the chance because it's a better offer it's a better deal i mean but some some people uh feel that you know 

265.60 277.15 B: well it's very important to to to stay with these children because a lot of pe- children feel like okay i also teacher for a while and then oh they just left and where where'd they go they went to a private school because it's better paid and they know 

277.17 289.52 B: that the teachers really didn't care about them whereas you know well they they had that feeling it might not be true you know but they have that feeling oh well they didn't care about me they they just went for the money and they went for this and they went for that you know they went for the better situation you know 

289.59 293.14 B: the better deal if you will you know where whereas you know 

293.90 300.32 B: in uh back in the you know it was probably in the forty fifties and and and way be- before that 

301.39 308.25 B: they were teachers were given a lot more power over st- you know over students they were a lot they were told you know this is what 

306.56 315.48 A: that's why m- that's why more people are putting children in private schools and that's why private school it's a supply and demand it's just basic economics 

312.92 314.04 B: (( hm )) 

314.90 327.00 B: but i mean it's it's hurting the it's hurting our our society because our public school system is is a shambles in my opinion i mean i i i've been just from my experience this is from just from here here in n- new york but uh 

326.94 335.98 B: i've had friends from different uh states and and they're i mean i i've travelled different countries and see how they run their their school systems it's like 

335.86 341.35 A: my w- my wife my wife is polish she comes from poland okay 

340.40 347.78 B: and is she better you think she's is sh- uh was she better educ- is she better educated in high school how was her high school experience did she ever ex- explain 

346.78 351.35 A: oh they have they have much much much better education system over there 

349.39 350.59 B: (( of course )) 

351.12 354.44 B: well i think we have i think when when they uh when they uh 

353.59 359.45 A: so you know you know why it is because the the people who get the best grades are the ones who stay in school for free 

355.14 356.21 B: because they 

359.28 360.40 B: oh see y- 

360.22 368.22 A: if you don't get good grades you don't go to y- you don't you don't go to college because over there the the the state runs everything 

367.61 369.74 B: oh really 

368.49 376.13 A: okay and if you don't they have five hundred openings to get into a college if you're not in amongst the first five hundred people in grades you can't get it 

377.13 378.26 B: well you know 

378.10 389.83 A: doesn't matter where you're from how much money your mother and father make what type of work you do what the politics are the top five hundred people in grades for that particular subject in that school are the ones that get in 

387.04 388.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

389.34 395.65 B: so they so they're really uh so everyone's really uh motivated to to excel because they d- they don't wanna 

394.43 400.29 A: yeah the ch- the child- the children are motivated to excel because they know the longer they stay in school the better jobs they get 

399.74 400.68 B: yes 

400.93 402.71 A: and and uh 

402.86 412.71 A: and to get a scholarship in order to get a p- i mean but she's got like three brothers and sisters that are phds only because and they never paid for their college 

403.78 404.85 B: (( w- )) 

408.82 410.29 B: wow 

412.20 415.74 B: that's awesome 

414.26 416.60 A: but they but they got the grades to do it [noise] 

417.28 428.58 B: and i think it's also i mean i think a major problem is is you know what how our our systems are r- our school system is run right now i mean honestly 

426.84 441.38 A: well because it's [mn] a part of the problem with the public school is that even the kids it's i i know that there's ghetto areas and different kind of areas but um if if you don't get the grades they're gonna still pass you 

434.48 435.18 B: mm 

440.95 449.24 B: exactly and then you know what those students pass and they don't under- they don't even comprehend what they they can't even read or write 

446.93 459.17 A: and that's and that's why and that's why people who are middle to upper class are trying to get their kids into private schools instead of public schools the public school has no credibility therefore the teachers aren't gonna make the money 

457.05 458.36 B: (( [noise] )) 

459.00 462.12 B: it it it's so terrible because 

462.30 467.78 B: these children that are left behind and they're they're they're not cared about or 

466.83 470.60 A: they don't they don't leave 'em behind they pass 'em whether they can do the work or not 

470.02 472.34 B: that's that's yeah 

471.21 480.72 A: okay and costa r- i was in cost i lived in miami for a few years and i went down to visit costa rica costa rica has a ninety seven percent literacy rate 

474.78 475.81 B: (( oh really )) 

476.46 478.19 B: mhm 

479.90 480.80 B: wow 

480.77 490.49 A: and miami florida people learn two languages doesn't matter whether you're spanish or english if you're if you're in miami you will learn two languages 

485.79 487.34 B: really 

489.87 491.83 B: [laughter] that's amazing 

491.51 505.84 A: you know it's uh so in new york it's it's if the teachers are gonna pass the kids and here is the problem it's not the teachers' fault because if they don't pass the kids and the parents come in and say doesn't matter if they can read or not i want you to pass my kid 

505.01 506.73 B: yes 

506.17 513.11 A: okay and and if that's the way that the parents want it then the teachers ha- the teachers have no power 

512.66 520.33 B: yes they totally they have to do whatever the fa- the staff says i mean if their their bosses tell 'em ma- you make sure these kids get through 

520.33 534.93 B: it's like it's like a factory line you know but they're but we're not we're not getting any any out of it as a society we're getting we're getting less literacy and uh i mean we have the lo- lowest literacy literacy rates in the world i believe com even well maybe comparable to third world countries you know 

526.80 527.95 A: yeah the parents 

528.58 529.52 A: (( and p- i- )) 

532.46 543.59 A: it's ver- it's very low it's very very low you they have these things on t._v. and radio i mean like one third of the people in the united states couldn't pick miami out on the map 

542.13 546.99 B: oh my gosh well just even i mean well 

547.06 554.45 B: i mean i- it's also even a reflection of our our s- i mean i think it's a major reflection on our society in general because i was i was living in japan 

554.35 561.28 B: for the past uh few years and i mean the students there are just so dedicated they they go to school they wanna go to school 

561.10 570.51 B: they go to school for for six days a week and even on sundays they they take courses to get better in whatever they they're weak in whatever uh subject they're weak in 

569.30 579.99 A: well i i think that that's really the influence of the parents that do that though 'cause kids don't kids all over the world don't know one thing from the other it's all coming from the from the influence of the parents how they raise 

576.03 577.23 B: yeah 

578.58 591.12 B: oh the main the main source you know their their first influence is their parents and if the parents aren't around you know or the parents don't do their job as parents then i mean their main their main job is to take care of the children and 

582.39 583.98 A: (( them )) 

589.92 593.55 A: yeah the the problem isn't the school system the problem is single parenting 

593.36 597.09 B: oh single parenting is is killing us killing us right now 

594.94 599.48 A: [laughter] i mean tha- that's the biggest problem in america [laughter] 

598.19 599.95 B: (( because no because chil- children don't e- ))
