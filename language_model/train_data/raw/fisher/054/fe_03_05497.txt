0.00 0.79 A: andrew [mn] 

0.34 4.18 B: yes hi this is hoyt from los angeles how are you 

3.75 7.65 A: good how are you this is andrew in uh boston massachusetts 

7.03 10.60 B: okay you're the second bostonian i've talked to 

10.26 14.55 A: wow i guess we're popular in the old survey how's everything going on the west coast 

13.08 16.76 B: oh yeah oh yeah it's really hot out here 

16.17 20.24 A: ah same here ninety three and we got a hundred percent humidity today 

19.88 30.35 B: oh that's bad that's bad yeah but we don't have the humidity out here so uh what was it again it was about public and private schools using certain text books 

21.42 22.63 A: that's bad 

30.09 35.19 A: uh i guess yeah or you know making students read certain text books 

31.67 32.41 B: (( mm )) 

35.12 47.03 B: right right well um i guess straight up i'm basically against that i i think uh they should be able to read anything they want regardless of what it is i mean 

46.94 52.18 B: i notice that when i started school here i'm forty two years old i went back to school 

52.33 59.34 B: and i notice that they were teaching more uh plato classes than they were aristotle 

58.68 59.87 A: (( mhm )) 

59.26 71.12 B: and uh from the way i grew up and understood it plato was the criminal mind and aristotle was the business mind i couldn't understand why they weren't teaching the kids aristotle over plato 

66.93 68.36 A: (( mm mhm )) 

70.69 73.68 A: this is in college right or was this 

72.17 77.87 B: yeah yeah yeah and um you know i've just noticed that um 

78.30 86.77 B: [mn] a lot of the a lot of the books have a lot of erroneous information in 'em and um i know one of my psychology books 

86.89 95.57 B: um was talking for some reason it was talking about the male and female reproductive system and and of course i was working on something 

95.78 99.34 B: uh with that that the book never even 

99.41 113.13 B: hinted to you you'd had have to have more um information in order to know that but um i i don't know it's just things like you know these kids aren't really getting exactly what they should be getting 

100.41 101.39 A: really 

111.59 121.32 A: yeah but but you're you're you're you just said hat you would leave it open and they should be able to read whatever they f- would would find appropriate that would be school to school to school 

121.25 135.21 B: mm well yeah i think all of the schools should have them i mean um like the private schools don't they really teach the good stuff as opposed to just like community colleges or public schools 

135.22 145.00 A: i me- um i'm i was sta- i mean um i can uh in in regards to what is read i was actually thinking this question probably revolved around um you know middle and high schools and you know there's always kind of a set 

144.96 150.57 A: set group of works that people read like catcher in the rye that's kind of like a standard book that you read in high school 

148.60 151.35 B: mhm 

150.71 151.73 A: um 

151.64 165.69 A: i would be opp- i would i would probably be suggestive of you know a a long list of books that would be you know selected by a variety of people or variety of institutions you know a couple of hundred books that would be suitable to be read 

151.82 152.73 B: i was 

162.71 163.47 B: (( mm )) 

165.56 176.27 A: in a public school format um i wouldn't be opposed to new books being added all the time and i i wouldn't want to have like a set list of this must be read or these can't be read 'cause 

175.44 177.87 B: (( mhm )) 

176.53 182.27 A: um you know this is america and you know we don't like censorship or that's what i like to believe [lipsmack] 

181.54 188.19 B: right well me to now did you say that this uh this act- this is actually around 

188.46 192.42 B: middle schools and high schools and stuff and not just 

190.01 201.32 A: well i no that's that's and when i when i think of you know i i in in college i d- id i've only taken business courses in college so i'm not you know i don't really care what we're reading 'cause they're all kind of boring to me but um 

200.09 202.03 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

202.03 203.55 A: (( [lipsmack] uh but i )) 

202.59 207.93 B: so what for instance okay for instance what about like sex education 

208.00 212.57 B: should that be taught in uh grammar schools in the uh high schools 

212.36 214.19 A: in my opinion yeah 

214.87 223.46 B: [cough] him yeah 'cause i know that somehow that sometimes that fosters the i- idea that um 

223.26 235.09 B: you know the parents don't have to be responsible for teaching their kids about sex education but then yet they're teaching them way to early and getting the kids involved sexually way too early 

231.80 232.65 A: yeah 

234.81 244.68 A: which yeah which is true i mean i would ag- for a- for any of these type of conversations there's definitely you going to ha- especially in regards to schoo- public schooling in the united states you're going to have uh 

244.89 248.16 A: you know you're going to have fifty percent for and fifty percent against 

246.65 249.35 B: mhm 

248.41 250.08 A: so um 

250.27 263.78 A: [lipsmack] but in regards to um i mean i i'm again i'm going to taking this question to meaning the the english uh what is it fiction of non fiction book that would be read as part of a high school 

263.84 267.52 A: um program i would say you know there's 

265.50 270.65 B: (( mhm )) 

268.39 275.14 A: i would i w- i wouldn't i would you know there's going to be some books there there you know you know people would freak out about y- you know it uh 

274.28 276.61 B: yeah 

275.41 280.47 A: so i guess you know again i would say you know for public p- for public school system come up with a a 

280.55 287.36 A: list of three to five hundred books which you know whatever w- everybody seems to be comfortable with 

287.11 288.11 B: okay 

287.59 291.11 A: i don't know how easy that would be to do to create or anything like that 

288.23 289.45 B: well 

290.44 296.74 B: you know the the funny thing about censorship is that um what if you run across information 

296.99 302.98 B: that that has um say for instance has mystical con- uh content 

302.33 303.71 A: yeah right 

303.06 311.39 B: and as we evolve we we kinda want to get away from that because it seems like that type of information 

311.42 319.04 B: uh either bogs down the individual or actually keeps them in a state of ignorance so to speak 

319.37 322.73 B: would it be fair to censor 

322.87 325.31 B: religious and philosophical 

325.01 326.38 A: (( yeah )) 

325.61 326.70 B: um 

326.44 328.38 A: (( [mn] there you go yeah )) 

326.87 327.99 B: work 

328.24 341.68 B: or um 'cause you know that's the way they did with the bible to begin with they they were censoring the bible but [sigh] even even at my age now i keep thinking god if we could just get rid of the damn bible 

332.08 333.20 A: sure 

334.20 335.14 A: sure 

341.77 343.54 B: and some of the 

343.74 351.20 B: philosophy uh philoso- [lipsmack] uh the philosophers that have defaulted on their promises to make our lives a lot easier 

351.74 357.86 B: but then again if we do that [sigh] you know then we have to we would have to sensor a lot of other things wouldn't we 

357.88 369.82 A: yeah you mean you get into a big pissing contest when all this come up i mean uh w- you know i think i think actually catcher in the rye w- has been banned by some um high schools across the country uh 

368.94 369.92 B: mhm 

370.02 374.79 A: the diary of anne frank you know about the the dutch girl that hid a- 

373.81 376.96 B: you're kidding that's been censored but 

374.86 375.75 A: yeah 

376.34 389.03 A: that has been [cough] i've seen that in the paper over the past one or two years where that has been taken out of some you know you know could be ca- i i'm not really sure why any of these books were taken out but someone was opposed to them obviously now you're going to have 

389.00 392.08 A: some people are for and some people are against but uh 

391.16 398.79 B: that's pathetic that's that's something else now let's see anne frank that was uh wasn't was she jewish yeah she was jewish 

396.81 400.14 A: she was the jewish [mn] jewish dutch girl yeah 

399.53 401.55 B: yeah so 

400.36 402.43 A: who hid away from the nazis 

402.13 406.48 B: that obviously has some kind of antisemitic overtones huh 

406.15 409.20 A: i think the great gatsby has been um 

408.88 415.24 B: oh my god really [laughter] i enjoyed the hell out of those books and 

410.22 412.22 A: (( yeah [laughter] i mean )) 

414.03 420.94 A: they're i think they're all good too but then again you w- w- with well you know with what our kids are reading in public schools again you have 

420.44 421.59 B: [cough] 

420.95 430.69 A: uh many different focus groups looking in on these with and they've all got their own opinions about what our kids should be and what our kids shouldn't be reading and this is public schools you know 

430.88 434.73 A: who's for the public schools [cough] all of us are collectively 

435.04 440.88 B: so what would that do if we took out all of the fantasy based fiction based 

440.55 444.82 A: there wouldn't be much good stuff to read that's for sure [laughter] 

440.93 442.31 B: things 

443.16 457.87 B: yeah yeah so i'm wondering how would we end up i mean would we end up a culture that would just so clinical and only concerned with the facts and reality would that be a good thing or should we just maintain 

458.09 466.00 B: the uh propensity for fiction and and a- you know because the books that you just named off i didn't even know 

460.93 462.00 A: (( i )) 

466.22 472.25 B: that they were taken out mhm 

467.59 477.09 A: oh you probably had i think you probably die die of laughter if you if you'd seen some of the books that have probably been taken out of the uh out of our public school systems because they were found to be you know 

477.00 483.45 A: uh there be m- part of the material is not you know whatever it is too religious or uh who knows 

483.04 486.92 B: and yet the most harmful book i ever read in my life was plato 

486.71 488.65 A: (( exa- there you go [laughter] )) 

487.89 497.93 B: i mean because i'm not that kind of person i i do have hope in certain things but my god you know this this god was nothing but a straight out crook 

498.08 501.06 B: and um i see it every day the way 

500.90 506.70 B: we are you know we're trapped around pseudo intellectuals i just finished a book of poetry 

506.39 507.21 A: (( uh-huh )) 

506.66 519.11 B: now poetry was religious and politically charged and of course they nominated me as as poet of two thousand three but i never won anything i never heard anything back from them because i think it scared the shit out of them 

518.29 519.53 A: (( sure [noise] )) 

519.42 532.48 B: and uh you know it just really kills me because i i tried to use my left brain as much as i could you know in in in constructing the poetry but um 

532.37 538.22 B: i kinda felt like i was censored too because at one point they were taking a lot [noise] of my stuff off 

538.23 552.07 B: and then i threatened them with a law suit and the next think i know they put everything back on but yet i still you know i still don't hear anything about it and that's what really kills me is because they're going to censor whether we say it's good or not 

551.46 552.28 A: yep 

552.32 553.66 B: and um 

553.57 565.84 B: you know that that's kinda like what i want to do with my life is to try to do everything to get these mystical people to either tell the truth and fess up or either just stop the shit 

565.69 573.98 B: and let's get on with science and math and and uh you know the rest of it i mean i i think art and everything is okay 

570.98 571.90 A: (( yeah )) 

574.10 581.11 B: but um you know really when you think about it poetry is not every really a valid art you know but um 

581.26 592.90 B: i still enjoy doing it so i understand why i wouldn't want to censor it but um i don't know that's that's really one of the toughest questions i've had to deal with so far on this one 

583.73 584.77 A: yeah 

592.53 599.95 A: yeah for sure i mean while it's in it's and it's kinda sad that even they had to think that you know in in this country we'd be doing that 'cause we are so
