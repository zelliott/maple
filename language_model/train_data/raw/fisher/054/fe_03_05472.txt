0.95 2.16 B: hello 

1.78 3.71 A: uh hi i'm norman leitch 

3.33 5.97 B: hey norman i'm todd turner how are you 

6.17 7.40 A: uh fine 

7.03 14.73 B: good good uh as the topics uh our feelings on banning in smoking in what was it all public places 

15.30 17.05 A: (( um )) 

15.41 17.60 B: or something something to the effect 

17.88 20.40 A: yeah smoking and uh 

20.75 25.41 A: the uh smoking cessation programs and uh 

26.46 28.23 A: i guess along those lines 

28.11 33.99 B: i uh i i'm i'm personally not a smoker and no one in my family is i 

34.10 37.17 B: i uh as far as smoking bans i'm 

37.27 44.01 B: i'm kind of pro smoking bans i uh hate to be at a restaurant or even 

44.27 48.50 B: i i i live in nashville and there are a lot of places here that have already banned smoking s- 

48.54 53.55 B: smoking from public buildings and restaurants and things of that nature but um 

52.88 53.85 A: mhm 

53.86 67.36 B: as far as smoking cessation programs i think it's a it's a great benefit for those that have that i guess that's part of their employee benefit package or if it's a non profit that helps them with that but i 

66.48 67.98 A: right 

67.22 69.78 B: think that's just a lot of a lot of uh 

70.30 75.89 B: quite honestly a lot of wasted money because of the fact that i i just i don't know how effective they are mhm 

76.01 77.27 A: um 

77.28 82.71 A: i believe that smoking is a very difficult thing to break it's a it's a pretty serious addiction 

83.06 85.52 A: um i'm not a smoker either 

85.79 89.98 A: but i think the government's gone overboard with banning smoking 

90.16 91.89 A: in so many places 

92.17 95.95 A: and i agree with you i don't i don't wanna sit in a restaurant 

96.09 99.68 A: where smoke from four smokers is coming onto my table 

100.61 107.60 A: um and i actually don't go to places that that have a tremendous amount of smoke [noise] uh you know fire hall 

107.54 114.72 A: fire hall parties and things like that or um i don't go to those things because of the smoke 

109.23 110.85 B: (( mhm right )) 

114.66 125.48 A: but i sort of think that people have the right even even though i don't agree it's a good thing or a safe thing to do i sort of agree they have to make their own choice 

125.21 126.98 B: mhm 

125.91 128.19 A: and i do believe that um 

128.39 133.10 A: i i believe the laws will tend to get people away from that eventually 

133.04 133.89 B: mhm 

133.98 135.20 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

135.31 136.40 B: i uh 

136.44 138.06 B: [cough] as far as 

138.49 139.28 B: uh 

139.24 139.80 B: (( [mn] )) 

139.68 142.56 B: smokers having rights to to do that 

142.42 145.88 B: i i i do agree with you i am a a a fairly 

145.71 158.78 B: objective person but i i've noticed over time uh for instance if you've been in in a in an airport lately and i've been in some through saint louis and in dallas and of course here in nashville they ha- actually have a 

152.45 153.47 A: mhm 

158.61 163.99 B: it's it's ki- it's kind of it's almost comical but it's kind of sad they have a 

164.08 173.60 B: a glass encased room with ventilation and you know and and and the smokers are in there like like they're caged animals smoking their hearts away and 

169.49 172.07 A: [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] 

172.86 176.03 A: that was the same thing i was thinking when you were saying that 

175.39 177.61 B: [laughter] i was i i mean it's 

177.62 181.37 B: [cough] i i don't i i i mean i don't think they should be 

181.50 186.47 B: you know put on island by themselves but i i suppose uh 

186.90 188.23 B: (( i mean it [mn] )) 

188.25 197.84 B: i i it it's hard to it's hard to describe i don't have any ill will towards anyone that smokes i just [mn] and i and i do the same with my family as what you were just saying i 

197.97 200.09 B: really don't tend to to 

200.10 205.28 B: go towards the types of places that would that that that would even be a problem for us 

205.12 206.09 A: right 

205.48 216.95 B: but uh i think it's so funny wi- my wife and i and my my son went to a went to eat at a little mexican restaurant here in our in our little we live in a little town right outside of nashville and 

216.93 228.34 B: the smoking section and non smoking section i i mean i i could touch elbows with some one that that that technically in the s- you know well this table is smoking but this is non smoking but there's no there's no 

222.94 223.77 A: oh 

226.93 227.85 A: right 

228.36 229.78 B: you know there's nothing 

228.96 230.25 A: no divider 

229.85 232.68 B: exactly um i uh 

232.40 242.69 A: now i know when they design restaurants now they design them so that the airflow goes from the non smoking side to the smoking side if it happened to be done that way 

242.36 243.25 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

242.72 250.85 A: but i agree i've been in places too where you know we asked to move because the smoke was coming from the smoking section right onto our table 

250.32 251.98 B: right right 

251.37 254.65 A: and you know again i tend to 

255.64 263.73 A: you know i tend to let stuff go where other people would you know be upset about it but i also see the same thing with uh seatbelt laws 

259.03 260.81 B: mhm 

263.57 265.42 B: mhm 

264.44 271.30 A: you know they you didn't have to wear seatbelts then they put 'em in the cars now you'll be arrested if you're not wearing a seatbelt 

271.18 272.69 B: yeah i i 

272.90 273.77 B: that 

273.05 276.74 A: government is tending to make make us uh 

277.11 280.05 A: be safe whether we want to be or not 

279.99 282.42 B: that is [mn] i mean you 

282.60 289.97 B: you've actually brought up another good point and that in the case of in the ca- uh maybe it's just my 

289.90 291.44 B: personal belief but 

291.32 299.69 B: if if it were not a law and i don't know how you and and your family interact with this but if the and i'm not i'm not at all trying to get off the topic but if 

299.56 312.15 B: the seatbelt law in in fact were not there i would be the kind of person to go i would still wear my seatbelt because if i'm gonna die i i don't wanna die in a car wreck i'd rather be doing 

310.74 312.52 A: n- not stupidly 

312.31 323.72 B: yeah exactly i- if it's some- if if man is smart enough to create something to to help me then i'm certainly smart enough to use it and back to the smoking issue i i've never really 

313.68 314.49 A: yeah 

323.70 333.36 B: uh i i i've actually never smoked uh a cigarette or cigar or anything in my life and i've never really had a desire to um i don't 

333.34 340.72 B: uh they were that little uh recording about the topics didn't it say something about the tobacco companies making an effort to 

340.87 350.61 B: to uh make it either not harder for underage children to smoke but just it it's kind of an oxymoron it's a you know ironic 

350.62 365.55 B: thing for tobacco companies to be promoting uh you know non smoking campaigns uh and i think they've got a a very large uphill battle with the way that they market it and the way they advertise in years past 

365.09 369.66 A: right and they're it's a public relations battle now they're trying not to look so bad 

369.34 370.23 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

370.03 372.26 A: so that they don't lose too much money 

372.34 374.47 A: and get sued too badly 

374.93 380.04 A: um they don't want people to quit smoking but they have to make sure that they're not targeting 

380.36 382.53 A: uh a youthful market 

381.97 383.09 B: right 

382.93 384.59 A: now they target 

384.82 388.85 A: their advertising and sending their product all over the world 

389.36 392.65 A: and i sort of have a little problem with that 

392.08 393.31 B: (( yeah )) 

392.71 393.78 A: um 

393.30 401.71 B: w- what's your feeling towards uh before say in an area that that the government doesn't put an official ban on smoking but say a 

401.56 411.42 B: a privately owned uh chain of restaurant and i guess restaurants is the most typical i don't think any malls or or other public gathering spots these days 

411.34 422.70 B: uh maybe an outdoor outdoor style mall will let people smoke where you know it's it's open air but say an indoor mall i don't i i i really can't think of one that that is smoking [mn] 

421.43 424.26 A: no they've cut they've cut that out [noise] 

423.98 425.95 B: w- what's your feeling on 

425.97 432.43 B: government forcing them to do that or or a company like that voluntarily standing up before that ever comes along 

432.30 441.66 B: and raises their hand and says hey we're we're going to not allow smoking in our restaurants any longer do you see a big difference with with that approach 

441.74 442.97 A: um 

443.16 445.84 A: well because it's a privately owned facility 

445.48 447.17 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

446.24 450.49 A: and they chose to do that for you know whether it's economically 

450.51 455.89 A: uh important for them to you know because of uh burned up furnishings or 

456.26 458.41 A: uh just cleaning [noise] 

458.67 464.53 A: and smell uh if they chose to do that i don't really have a problem with that because it is a privately owned facility 

464.94 473.17 A: um [noise] i don't think it ever would've come about if there ha- if it hadn't got the point where the government was passing laws 

473.23 474.10 B: yeah 

473.48 476.57 A: because most people were were sort of um 

478.33 481.13 A: the almighty dollar kept them from 

481.35 484.92 A: hindering anybody from doing anything that might reduce business 

484.49 485.64 B: mhm 

485.33 493.81 A: so now with the when the govern ment says hey we don't want you to smoke in these places [noise] now they're they're not gonna lose business because they don't allow smoking 

494.24 497.73 A: and there's enough places now that don't allow smoking that 

497.85 503.19 A: uh people won't not go out to a restaurant because they can't smoke 

502.59 503.84 B: (( mhm mm )) 

503.29 505.23 A: they've learned to uh 

506.08 513.73 A: you know smoke before smoke after but i i agree with you you'll see fifteen people standing outside the door of an o- of a building 

513.93 515.26 A: smoking 

515.66 518.43 A: it looks like a bunch of loiterers and riffraff 

517.60 519.23 B: yeah yeah 

518.66 525.28 A: uh smoking outside the building because they're not allowed to smoke in the building and i think they are being punished a little 

525.87 527.73 A: but it's uh 

527.06 541.24 B: w- what about this i i'm and i i i apologize i didn't mean to seem as if i was cutting you off but w- what about employers and this is i i don't f- fall into this category but what about employers that give official 

533.32 534.13 A: (( no no )) 

537.75 538.31 A: (( [cough] )) 

541.15 549.53 B: uh i don't even know if they're out there still but like employ- employers giving official smoke breaks or or i guess regular 

549.50 560.86 B: well no that's i'm i'm really not making a lot of sense now because if an employer gives a break period it's an employee's decision to do whatever they want to on that right so mhm 

558.06 559.68 A: right the smoker not 

560.24 561.32 A: um 

562.39 571.05 A: i i don't uh you know i i know people had breaks but corporations tend to try to reduce them because it reduces productivity 

571.20 576.93 A: so where i work it's a it's a union shop and we have designated breaks 

577.13 581.99 A: and it's a set amount of time and the employees always push it to the limit 

582.04 583.10 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

582.48 595.07 A: but again like you said it's not it's not designated for any particular purpose it but it's basically following the federal law that after so many hours at work you're entitled to a fifteen minute break 

586.81 588.05 B: right i can 

594.53 595.59 B: (( okay okay )) 

595.21 599.89 A: and i think it's uh i think it's five hours or something like that you're entitled to a fifteen
