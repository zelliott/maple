70.03 72.94 A: one out of two en- marriages ends in divorce today 

72.69 75.07 B: yeah it's ridiculous

98.17 101.99 A: and uh that's okay that's okay i agree with i 

102.08 104.31 A: work with an evangelical mission uh 

104.69 106.05 B: mhm 

105.85 119.55 A: and uh they think that uh i need to break from the work to [mn] to do that and that's good uh they it's nice to have employers that um have a commitment to [mn] uh marriage before 

118.86 123.14 B: yeah well it's something very important and to work on 

121.49 122.63 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

122.83 125.27 A: uh we have 

125.71 128.75 A: [mn] we have twelve children 

128.87 130.05 B: oh wow 

129.71 136.14 A: and uh between twenty one your own age there and uh [mn] and three 

136.36 143.74 A: and uh i guess our i have a whole personal belief on marriage you know how it's affected our our my personal behavior 

143.94 154.72 A: comes from a belief system that comes out of the scriptures uh the holy bible there [mn] and uh in malachi it says very simply that god hates divorce 

148.28 148.85 B: (( [noise] )) 

149.37 150.45 B: mhm 

155.05 156.19 B: yeah 

155.68 160.54 A: uh it usually represents selfishness um [lipsmack] 

161.01 163.04 A: (( ah it um )) 

164.02 171.77 A: selfishness uh and unwillingness to get along an unwillingness to accept wrongs done to you by another person and [sigh] 

171.22 180.23 B: well i see it as an unwillingness to get along i don't know if it's entirely selfishness 'cause i know you know my my got divorced and i don't know if i can 

171.84 172.58 A: (( who )) 

179.58 180.99 A: got divorced sorry

183.15 185.47 A: did you i'm sorry you're not coming through real good 

184.86 192.39 B: uh okay um i was just saying that um i i don't know if it's selfishness i agree that it's just like an inability to uh 

192.50 203.27 B: agree with one another at one point so like i don't know if i support it because i would rath- i would not [mn] ever like to get divorced but i don't know if it's something that's utterly 

203.37 204.59 B: yeah 

204.06 207.03 A: you think an- anybody ever likes to get divorced 

206.44 213.26 B: oh no of course not i mean that's [mn] i definitely agree that it's a terrible terrible thing that happens 

212.02 219.58 A: okay so one of the things we've made a personal commitment not to divorce okay because everybody at some point in their marriage 

215.78 217.13 B: yeah 

219.68 221.33 A: uh at least one 

221.59 222.48 A: [laughter] 

222.38 222.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

222.73 232.08 A: finds a time and when they're not gonna get along and about [mn] fairly big things or at least important to thing things that are important to you and uh 

232.46 234.85 A: [sigh] so um 

235.25 240.54 A: you try to keep your marriage so that it outlasts those difficulties um 

239.73 241.12 B: mhm 

240.67 243.13 A: and and that's uh 

243.52 247.10 A: that's tough to do for sure it's it's it's hard to do uh [lipsmack] 

246.52 250.53 B: yes it is it takes a lot of uh effort 

250.96 260.67 B: i'm sure i can't imagine you know only being twenty one not being [mn] or being with someone for like twenty years or beyond it seems like a ridiculously long time 

260.12 261.84 A: to be with them 

261.25 271.59 B: uh to to like marry someone and be with them for you know a very very long time like i i haven't been in a relationship that's lasted more than like a year and a half so 

272.15 282.08 A: [mn] [lipsmack] uh i think let me work work with you from a little older perspective imagine being in some with somebody for twenty two year relationship 

272.41 274.43 B: it just boggles my mind 

281.47 282.67 B: mhm 

282.14 284.04 A: and then splitting up 

283.46 284.68 B: yeah 

284.16 291.15 A: um i i think the the a comic said it best to me some years ago that i read on an airplane 

291.28 294.46 A: and it's two it's a grandma and a grandpa 

294.97 298.81 A: [lipsmack] and uh they're looking through photo albums 

299.58 308.86 A: uh or she's looking through a photo album sorry and she leans over to him and she says and they're of grandkids and she says are these yours or mine 

310.37 312.98 A: and that just broke my heart because 

312.33 313.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

313.54 319.74 A: here it is now now maybe they're a widow and a widower you know who knows uh but if it's because of divorce 

316.78 317.76 B: yeah 

319.94 321.83 A: [sigh] all of a sudden 

322.31 335.65 A: the foot the you're looking at pictures of a former spouse pictures of chi- uh uh that is no longer in your life and just causes [sigh] disquiet in your current spouse's life [noise] 

335.22 336.36 B: yeah 

335.85 344.94 A: um it's the children you've betrayed uh time magazine or um did an article on divorce and it says divorce hurts every last child 

345.27 353.35 B: yeah it does it does hurt i mean you know my parents got divorced and it was really just a unpleasant thing all round 

345.83 346.57 A: yeah 

347.49 349.23 A: i'm sure i'm sure 

352.84 355.39 A: and the form of vulnerability you must feel you 

355.09 367.50 B: yeah yeah for a while i mean they got divorced when i was thirteen but now i don't i mean i can see both my stepparents and you know be able to relate to them not as parents but as uh because they married my parents 

365.49 366.70 A: have to go on 

367.30 369.37 A: yeah you have to go on for sure 

369.11 370.11 B: yeah 

369.60 374.42 A: and uh but i mean here's the [noise] um most 

374.73 378.42 A: uh intimate of relationships um 

378.51 388.43 A: the most solemn of vows that's betrayed we had a premier in our province that [sigh] after he became premier started sleeping around with another [sigh] 

388.98 389.80 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

389.95 392.80 A: person who's in the government and dumped his wife 

393.14 394.18 B: yeah 

393.29 396.74 A: and uh you know i i said to people 

397.49 402.91 A: if he's not gonna keep his vows to his wife and [mn] of course he went from an old woman to a 

403.15 406.77 A: young woman with nice perky tits and everything and um 

405.35 406.74 B: [laughter] 

407.83 411.85 A: uh which is selfishness and and uh 

410.04 411.10 B: yeah 

412.41 422.32 A: i said you know th- this is a guy who who his wife can't trust him to keep his vows and we're supposed to trust him to keep his vows to us 

422.06 423.89 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

423.00 426.31 A: if his wife can't trust him how am i gonna trust him you 

425.67 426.88 B: exactly 

426.77 428.46 A: know and so i- i- it 

426.96 429.53 B: that's supposed to be the most sacred 

429.00 437.90 A: yeah it becomes a- a- a um confidence issue uh in many ways but uh so you know it's 

438.44 443.42 A: i don't know it that that's what are some of the thoughts you have i'm not a good listener 

443.35 449.59 B: um it's all right um i don't know but what was the initial topic 'cause it was um 

448.44 452.65 A: either you feel the increase in divorce has altered your behavior 

453.14 454.18 A: um 

454.76 457.72 B: i think i think it makes uh it a little 

455.03 456.08 A: and 

457.81 465.75 B: it makes um marriage a little more daunting just knowing so many people that are you know not being able to work out through their marriage 

465.50 466.97 A: okay has it changed 

465.97 467.67 B: i think for me 

467.51 469.68 A: okay yeah 

468.79 470.86 B: in particular i mean 

470.97 480.99 B: it just makes it seem like something that's a little less realistic at my age when in you know uh a while back it was something that was considered much you know earlier 

481.34 487.41 A: well al- it also used to be something that you could say hey this is the sort of the end of the rainbow 

487.65 492.56 A: um getting to grow old with somebody and now for many people 

487.93 489.06 B: yeah 

493.28 501.58 A: they're not investing as much in their marriage or in as much in that other person because they're afraid that it won't last 

500.98 502.37 B: yeah 

501.76 506.81 A: and uh and that's that's gotta hurt our culture i think um 

506.23 514.74 B: i agree that it's we have a very very compared to other cultures we have a very high divorce rate and it seems you know a lot 

514.74 521.25 B: these troubles that go along with staying married if you're not in love with the person but i mean i think that 

521.09 532.23 B: getting divorced is often something that people do just you know when some troubles come along and they don't wanna work 'em out so they just get divorced instead i think that 

529.89 537.68 A: yeah it's interesting how you put that it's there's troubles staying married to somebody that you're not in love with them any more isn't love a decision though 

537.90 539.13 B: pardon me 

538.62 540.70 A: isn't love a decision you make 

540.43 541.98 B: yeah i mean 

542.05 547.73 B: i don't know that's that's a really tough question for me i think it i- it it's part you know 

547.90 552.25 B: something c- chemistry related i guess like you know chemical rather 

552.51 556.93 B: um something you know also that you have to really work at 

556.78 565.70 A: you know i had a preacher once said you know marriage [mn] it isn't love that keeps marriage together it's marriage that keeps love together and and and and 

556.97 558.01 B: to keep 

565.74 576.44 A: in in the main i agree with the sentiment i mean you can fall in and outta love with a person over and over again [mn] in your life well what helps you keep your promises to that person is the fact that you made a covenant with them [sigh] 

575.84 577.02 B: yeah 

576.49 580.80 A: um and despite you know the little bit of trouble we've had um 

581.80 595.25 A: that uh where we've had to where i've had to take a break in uh my job um that is to work on our marriage that's fine with me [mn] the marriage comes first there uh 

591.46 592.54 B: mhm 

595.77 596.82 A: now [sigh] 

597.31 599.89 A: um but yeah i ju-
