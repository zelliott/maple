233.77 237.29 A: (( oh i don't know i don't really keep up with it too much unless it's out on video )) 

236.30 241.22 B: yeah yeah the last one i know of hers that one where she's supposedly a hooker and that 

240.79 247.77 A: oh yeah i know what you're talking about yeah [laughter] pretty woman that's a good movie now [lipsmack] so uh 

241.78 242.83 B: pretty woman 

245.67 246.53 B: yeah 

247.82 251.67 A: so is it pretty expensive going to the movies down where you're at 

250.94 258.07 B: oh it's about you figure after sodas and everything like this you figure for one person you just about spent ten bucks 

253.40 254.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

255.33 262.55 A: yeah really that's not too bad not too bad at all it's almost yeah it's probably 

262.42 275.46 A: i don't know see the only reason i like to go out like to bring my shit home with me is sometimes if you go to like blockbuster or something you get to keep it for like a week or something so you're just not obligated to watch it that one time but uh oh it's all right so 

265.94 267.07 B: mhm 

269.67 270.72 B: yeah 

275.32 281.16 B: yeah well the only thing good about home you just go out buy yourself a box of that uh po- movie popcorn 

276.76 301.04 A: [noise] yeah [noise] yeah it's ju- yeah [noise] [noise] yeah yeah definitely man yeah then you're freaking right at home man 

281.28 283.11 B: toss it in the microwave 

283.23 285.65 B: go out buy yourself a case of soda 

286.68 293.01 B: and then just if you get one of those good home systems where you got a flat t._v. screen that hangs on a big wall 

293.19 295.19 B: that's almost like being there 

295.79 298.91 B: and then then have yourself a surround sound system 

300.78 301.79 B: mhm 

301.05 314.97 A: that's why that's why i like it man 'cause you can see it at your enjoyment like the theaters man sometimes you get like shitty seating so like i don't know you have to worry about being in people's way and like people talking and like answering phones and crap like that man home you just you know you do what you want 

313.27 318.81 B: [mn] [cough] that's why i say that's why i say i go to the first one and then i or the last one of the day 

318.51 321.46 A: (( man yeah yeah don't have to worry about that crap huh )) 

321.10 326.09 B: and then you ain't got to put up with a whole bunch of people 'cause who wants to be out there and catch that eleven o'clock movie

355.88 359.95 B: oh affirmative action i didn't know what the heck that was and i hung up 

359.36 373.50 A: yeah [laughter] so i had this guy that was right that actually works in a in a in a prison so he was telling me all about the crap that goes on down there and stuff so that was all right but uh no i'm originally from maine i just moved down to staten island not too long ago so [lipsmack]

387.95 393.62 A: mhm yeah [noise]

403.34 405.89 B: growing up during the rainy season 

405.63 407.62 A: yeah

413.19 414.72 A: (( yeah )) 

418.06 419.11 A: uh-huh

456.09 469.50 A: really no shit man that's cool yeah [lipsmack] i just have to look out my windows and i can see like manhattan like over the water and uh i don't know if you've ever been up to new york city or whatever but it's 

464.55 465.59 B: (( yeah ))
