104.01 109.28 B: i certainly didn't apply myself as much as i could have in school and uh 

109.53 116.25 B: i don't know exactly what reason because once i got out to work i worked hard and um did other did other things 

115.65 120.16 A: what was your career when you when you first went to school or you want to uh wanted to do

131.68 137.96 B: yeah i really didn't have that much i i guess i i probably should have waited to go to school because i really didn't know what i wanted to uh 

138.28 140.70 B: to do i just sort of went through school [laughter] 

140.36 141.48 A: (( yeah i know )) 

141.63 147.63 B: and then but you know it certainly i certainly got a lot out of it i just i guess i could have gotten more

301.49 304.67 A: [laughter] 

303.67 308.08 B: [laughter] but i guess that's probably to hear that [laughter] that's how that's everybody does that 

306.15 308.63 A: [laughter] well like a lot of people say that you know 

308.17 309.78 B: [laughter] 

309.20 312.09 A: you know but this is an interesting topic you know 

311.61 312.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

312.20 316.53 A: i know that i'm going to ask a lot of people this you know what could they change in their life and all that you know 

317.03 325.74 B: yeah well we have to yeah at first when they said time travel i thought they were talking about uh you know really going back in time and uh you know like superman or what 

317.08 317.92 A: you know 

324.97 333.19 A: [laughter] you know no one to change time i would if i would have done if there was this not me personally i would change back the whole uh 

326.43 328.82 B: flying backwards or whatever it was 

333.21 344.86 A: the war situation world war one and all that you know but but what i would change and i have lived through it i have lived mos- i lived most of it was the vietnam war was the vietnam war 

344.17 352.96 B: yeah that was a mess that's for sure that was like a s- it would have been hard to really change something there because uh we accepted right at the first we probably just should have said we're not gonna go 

345.56 346.51 A: and we had 

352.21 357.76 A: you know it's like go- it's like going in the in the woods were you are and and you don't know what you're going into it's like you know what i'm saying 

357.91 358.82 A: it's it's 

358.06 359.91 B: that's for sure but 

359.10 363.03 A: you know bro' we we have the technology now then it would have been a lot different you know 

363.19 366.82 B: then you look at some things like uh i'm a big fan of uh reagan 

366.79 379.54 B: and you know what he did and and all the time he was trying to you know stand up to the to the russians and whatever all his advisers the people of the state department said oh no no don't say that they're going to get pissed off you know and he said [noise] mm 

377.37 379.74 A: [noise] look at them now they're good friends with us 

380.08 385.74 A: look at the rea- look at reagan now they they deserted him because he he's senile and everything and that's wrong 

385.91 386.76 A: you know 

386.28 389.07 B: yeah that's a tough a tough thing uh 

388.16 398.60 A: you know reagan did a lot but you know it's it's like you know they're now they you know they're blaming reagan and that you know they always loved reagan and then look at him now it's just his family taking care of him 

397.53 410.88 B: yeah well i think that's the way they would that she wants it i i'm not i'm not sure on all those details but um yeah pretty uh that's a pretty tough way to go for a guy like that man he had it had everything right 

403.59 405.82 A: but we never know we will never know 

410.28 423.51 A: yeah he did he was an actor and all of that and we know he had a wrestle there with a a as a governor you know and he did good for the state you know what he had to do and i don't know but if we have a lot of good presidents and a lot of bad ones a lot 

422.25 428.16 B: i guess the only thing only place here they kiss your ass more than being an actor is being a president 

427.62 430.10 A: that's it that's it that's it 

429.25 435.58 B: [laughter] although then you have your you know the actors don't have to put up with as many critics i guess although they have their uh [noise] 

433.83 439.36 A: like clint east- like clint like clint eastwood was a mayor you know and it's it's one of those things you know 

439.63 453.08 A: but you know it's it's the economy is good it's it's going to take them on for for you know for the bad there 'cause saddam they couldn't get him or nothing you know so one of those but to change history i would have done the vietnam war i would have went back there know the knowledge i had today 

453.28 461.04 A: you know to br- to bring back into into that time because i lost an uncle there so it's like he was a prisoner of war and he got killed 

460.38 462.07 B: oh man that's a tough thing 

461.45 465.06 A: no no to change to change the history 

464.12 470.93 B: yeah i i i wouldn't disagree or you know like if somebody had been smart enough to uh stop hitler at the at the beginning boy that would have 

469.92 482.27 A: even hitler yeah but but he was a genius you know that he had to listen to everybody else you know people think because we beat we beat them but they had better technology than we did believe it or not you know 

471.28 472.64 B: lot of difference 

482.01 483.71 B: oh yeah if uh 

484.23 487.23 B: if if hitler hadn't screwed some things up 

486.67 488.83 A: well you know where we would have been today 

488.35 494.14 B: you know 'cause he was sort of well i guess he was sort of like completely nuts [laughter] what's his problem 

492.81 498.57 A: yeah but but we would have never known that that's the whole thing but he was a genius 

496.03 497.15 B: right 

498.40 506.68 B: yeah if they'd have concentrated more on the the jets and some of the other weapons that they had then uh we would have been we'd probably all speaking uh german 

505.96 514.09 A: [laughter] you know it i know it i know it a lot of things happened in our lifetime you know it's the next generation is coming up you know 

514.50 520.23 A: i don't know i don't know i i lost a family friend in that nine eleven thing and when i went back there it was 

520.29 523.42 A: it was it was hard it was hard 

523.45 528.49 B: yeah it yeah i i guess it's an idle fantasy though to think that you could um 

528.65 532.32 B: that you can you know obviously you can't go back and change things 

531.60 546.04 A: but but if you want to go back and change things that's what you know in your lifetime or my lifetime we've seen a lot you you can't pick really you know really one but if in my lifetime could be a vietnam it could be desert storm it could be just my personal life it could be anything 

536.30 537.33 B: yeah 

545.74 547.91 B: yeah that's true that's true 

548.21 552.23 A: but who but if someone had to go time travel that'd be a good question what to change you know 

552.85 558.05 A: you know if you change that what would it 'cause the history of the other things that's the whole thing 

557.95 567.72 B: oh there's a neat book i can't remember the title by michael crichton about the time travel they go back to a medieval castle in in in france and uh 

567.99 574.42 B: it's sort of weird they go back and forth a couple of times [laughter] but it's pretty exciting he writes pretty good interesting books 

572.84 580.13 A: yeah i heard of him but but you know what i'm trying to say if you want to change hitler what would happen to the to how would the worlds change you know what i'm saying 

579.24 585.63 B: there's somebody else would have probably uh you know uh well stalin would have probably gone crazy started to march uh 

585.08 589.39 A: you know what i'm saying if you change one thing what would happen in the whole history of the world 

588.82 590.34 B: well that's for sure 

589.77 599.89 A: you know if you go okay fine well say we stop the vietnam war what would happen to the rest of the commu- what about the vietcong you know you know what i'm saying you can never change if you change one thing it will affect the other 

596.43 597.44 B: yeah
