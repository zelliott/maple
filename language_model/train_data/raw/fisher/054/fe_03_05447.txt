100.23 101.34 B: yeah 

105.57 114.06 A: all the theaters here are at least eight dollars i think the one that's close to my house is eight fifty yeah and i try to like i said the other thing uh 

110.13 111.74 B: yeah 

114.51 126.35 A: like i'll try i i get if you get caught up in like all the hype in those movies you go see the movies and then there's like there's all kinds of like advertising in the actual movies and stuff and like that gets annoying too and i remember 

125.67 136.23 B: yeah they're having like regular commercials now you know before they start showing the previews you know the lights go down and everything like that you're ready to see previews and and here you are 

128.48 130.43 A: in the beginning of the movie like in 

136.10 144.44 B: you know watching a a type of commercial that that you see on t._v. oh what's up with that [laughter] [laughter] 

139.32 146.14 A: yeah for a car or something yeah mhm like a car commercial and yeah and i get a- yeah i get annoyed at that so 

146.04 156.31 A: you know i i maybe go like you know when i do finally go go in the movies it's because it's like it's either a movie that's been so hyped up like i saw because i see like star wars or 

156.09 157.33 B: oh yeah 

156.19 162.25 A: spiderman and i'll i'll probably go see like terminator three next week or something but it's like 

159.64 160.73 B: me too 

161.23 164.05 B: i wanna go see the hulk [laughter] 

162.66 171.61 A: yeah the hulk too and it's because it gets it gets like pressured into your head you're like oh you gotta go see it so those are the ones that i go see but as far as like really go i mean 

167.76 168.92 B: mhm 

171.83 177.99 A: i try to avoid it for the most part i try to do something else you know what i mean now that i'm married and [noise] 

173.57 175.54 B: (( yeah )) 

176.59 181.14 B: well we have satellite too so you know there's times we get you know one of the pay per view 

181.16 189.49 B: movies and and they're a little more expensive than rental but it's a little more convenient you know 'cause you just push a couple of buttons 

184.13 185.24 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

186.81 188.04 A: exactly 

189.15 195.99 A: exactly yeah and it's ch- it's cheaper it's cheaper it's more convenient and everything yeah very true 

189.66 193.07 B: [laughter] and there you go you got it on there 

195.25 196.92 B: pop your own popcorn 

197.19 204.13 A: i think i saw i can't even remember but i think i the last movie i saw was uh identity which was like a thriller 

204.21 212.46 A: and um the whole time i was thinking i could probably have rented it [laughter] like with some of those blockbuster hit movies those real big ones like 

207.97 209.15 B: yeah 

212.39 221.51 A: with the special effects and such it is sometimes better to go the theater like something like star wars you know you'd wanna see that in a theater or whatever because it's like such a 

221.52 225.02 A: you know there's so much going on or whatever if you rent it you have 

223.21 234.38 B: yeah see that's what i like you know if it's something like that with all the effects and everything i like to get that that whole surround sound big screen you know [noise] 

225.16 226.15 A: yeah 

232.76 236.25 A: yeah but if it's like one of those stupid movies where 

236.22 240.90 A: you know like if there just no special effects or it's like this movie identity it was uh 

240.74 252.03 A: it was like a horror mystery type but it was more based on the mystery than it was so about seeing anything you know people were stabbed and stuff but it wasn't like anything exciting but 

251.13 253.09 B: yeah [laughter] 

251.96 262.18 A: it could have been so much easier to that's the kind of movie you rent you know or and a comedy too i i really rarely go see like a comedy in the theater bec- because those are ones you can rent 

259.31 264.50 B: me too yeah now terminator three that'll i think that'll be something to see 

263.63 269.03 A: yeah stuff's going to be blown up and the sound and everything else plus so that'll be really cool 

268.59 271.78 B: yeah yeah and um 

269.54 272.93 A: mhm so where do you live do you live 

272.64 274.04 B: i live in ohio 

273.00 273.68 A: in 

273.99 276.82 A: oh okay yeah people are all over the place 

274.61 276.34 B: northeast ohio 

276.68 281.18 B: yeah i i'm like right in between cleveland and pittsburgh 

280.80 282.38 A: oh okay yeah 

281.34 288.80 B: i'm like an hour like northwest of pittsburgh and an hour southeast of cleveland youngstown ohio 

287.23 292.98 A: yeah when you said when you said movies were did you say they were seven dollars or seven fifty 

292.26 293.95 B: seven fifty yeah 

293.32 307.53 A: yeah i figured that you probably didn't live in new jersey or new york city or anything [laughter] or anything around here 'cause um yeah everything's so much more expensive over here i guess but yeah like seven fifty would be i don't even think there's any theaters that are that cheap now 

296.90 297.89 B: (( hm mm )) 

298.39 299.55 B: no 

307.37 309.17 A: i think we're the s- we're the s- 

307.81 320.95 B: yeah it's i mean they keep going up and everything and i mean i play in a band and we charge five bucks at the door you know the bars we play for people to come see us and to me i think that's a real good deal because 

315.27 316.18 A: right 

320.87 329.51 B: you know we usually have an opening band that plays for almost an hour and then my band plays for two two and a half hours so i mean 

329.33 341.87 B: you're getting roughly four hours of entertainment you know for five bucks yeah okay your beer you know you're going to be paying you know two fifty a beer or something like that but still by the time it's all said and done 

334.27 336.05 A: yeah you can't beat that 

339.10 340.19 A: right right 

341.75 352.30 B: you know you've come out of there you know spending as much maybe even less in some cases than what you would to go see a movie that you're lucky is an hour and a half anymore 

351.72 353.18 A: exactly yeah [laughter] 

352.65 361.14 B: you know so the the price you know compared i mean i don't i don't feel bad having us charge five bucks at the door it's like hey man you know you can go see a movie 

361.23 369.31 B: you know and then you're going to pay out the nose for any any other treat that you want you know for an hour and a half you know you're going to pay almost twice as much 

365.37 366.20 A: yeah 

369.20 371.01 A: yeah absolutely 

370.46 372.03 B: [laughter] 

371.17 380.42 A: you said you said you're in a band or you um yeah i actually used to play in a band as well it was very very fun and i miss doing it very much 

373.32 375.32 B: yeah i play in a band 

379.94 381.60 B: yeah yeah 

380.54 390.72 A: it was more of a we didn't have like regular gigs at clubs or anything i guess that's you're talking more like a band that plays the same places each weekend is that what you 

389.43 401.30 B: yeah well we we play around the region and stuff like that you know and and i think you know dollar for dollar you know it's it's kind of a it it it is a better value than going to a movie but 

391.92 392.86 A: mhm 

401.11 409.29 B: you know like we were talking about there's there's definitely movies out there that that you wanna have that that whole you know theater experience with 

408.67 420.84 A: you know that in the theaters too they don't even uh the theaters actually don't even make that much money off the off the movies they make the majority of their receipts are off of uh the food and stuff they actually 

419.24 422.40 B: oh it's gotta be [laughter] 

421.05 423.44 A: yeah they get like a percentage 

423.21 430.55 A: they get a small percentage of the ticket price i don't what the percent is but i know it's fractional it's like a basic point percentage 

428.53 430.01 B: oh yeah 

430.32 443.24 A: i mean i think it might even be like pennies on the on the nine do- on the eight dollar ticket it might be like twenty cents i'm i'm serious i think it actually might be that low like a dollar or two dollars or like less than a dollar 

439.02 440.12 B: wow 

441.21 443.72 B: oh i can believe it 'cause they've got to pay 

443.74 447.62 B: you know like fees 'cause like um 

447.56 457.84 B: well like when a bar has cover bands and even a bar that has a jukebox they have to pay royalty fees to a._s._c._a._p. and b._m._i. and the publishing companies 

450.35 451.28 A: mhm 

452.08 452.92 A: yeah 

457.51 458.83 A: right right 

457.71 469.90 B: so the movie theater's gotta do the same thing they're they're paying to have the licensing to to play that movie so that's probably why they gage the prices well it's gotta be why they gage the prices on your popcorn [laughter] and your pop 

459.95 461.71 A: it's the same exact thing yeah 

464.28 465.31 A: (( yeah )) 

468.98 481.19 A: yeah 'cause that's the that's how they make the majority of their money is off but that m- but on the other end of it the mark up on that stuff is um it's ridiculous i mean it the soda 

470.12 471.35 B: [laughter] 

476.44 477.64 B: (( mhm )) 

479.81 486.43 B: oh yeah you probably got twenty cents into a large popcorn that they're charging you know five bucks for 

486.00 497.32 A: oh yeah or even less than even less than twenty cents it probably costs like two cents you know i mean i know like soda is the same way like soda is so cheap it's just like sugar and corn syrup 

486.65 489.56 B: [laughter] 

491.44 492.53 B: uh-huh 

497.21 506.75 A: and then they and like the big soda companies make it in such high volume that uh when they resell it's just like ridiculous they're making so much money 

505.26 509.73 B: oh yeah well and then they dump all that ice in there too 

506.78 507.72 A: i mean just 

509.38 511.98 A: yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah 

510.08 517.59 B: so you're only getting in a in a twelve ounce glass you're probably only getting you know four ounces of the actual cola 

517.30 518.43 A: yeah 

517.72 520.96 B: and then the rest [laughter] is is the ice [laughter] 

520.21 521.80 A: absolutely 

521.33 522.67 B: [laughter] 

521.88 533.78 A: i know you know what i hate too when you go see like one of those big hyped up hyped up movies and the movie like sucks so bad it's not even entertaining and you actually hate it i i saw not the latest matrix 

530.77 531.94 B: mhm 

533.72 537.05 A: i saw the first matrix and in the theater 

535.33 536.39 B: yeah 

537.13 542.72 A: and it just i know people love that movie it hit me wr- the wrong way i just did not enjoy 

542.52 547.43 A: i actually walked out towards the end of it i just i don't know why but it just 

544.70 546.06 B: [laughter] 

546.29 547.92 B: (( [laughter] )) 

547.26 561.38 A: i just i maybe i wasn't paying attention and i think well i just didn't understand the plot and the concept like it it was just too much for me i don't know why but i hated it so much i remember thinking it was like goddamn i'm so pissed about this it's like it just costs so much money 

559.65 563.18 B: yeah you just wasted all that money [laughter] 

561.47 566.52 A: [mn] yeah all the money i wasted all the time i wasted and i just didn't even enjoy the frigging movie 

566.71 569.57 A: i don't know and that's like so it's like it can be hit or miss like 

569.88 574.57 A: like the hulk i wanna see but i i don't know i heard from a couple of people that it wasn't that good so 

573.78 578.76 B: [laughter] yeah i'm sort of fifty fifty on it you know i i may end up just holding out 

576.62 579.27 A: you heard that it was not that good either right 

578.75 585.89 B: right right i may hold out on it you know i it it's it's debatable you know 

585.67 598.18 B: um it it depends on you know how bad the the wife and kids wanna go see it [laughter] uh we're really actually the one that we're anticipating now that's that's going to be coming out is the pirates of the caribbean 

591.10 592.11 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

597.90 599.89 A: yeah actually that looked pretty good too 

598.51 599.95 B: you know 'cause we're into the whole
