24.41 32.11 A: it and one stipulation would be to end a a friendship with a very close friend would you do it now 

31.88 34.52 B: yeah that's a that's a real interesting question 

34.69 49.38 A: yes it is it's it's kind of hard to answer that question you know know knowing an essential case 'specially if you know a million dollars is on the line and 'specially if you need the money i mean you 

47.29 49.24 B: yes well i mean 

49.58 52.96 B: if you watch people do many things for a million dollars now you know 

52.97 56.16 A: yeah people yeah 

53.51 57.47 B: so i mean will do almost anything to for a million dollars sometimes you know 

57.28 65.90 A: can yeah some people will sell their own integrity just to get a million dollars and you know knowing like you know how 

61.07 62.31 B: yeah 

65.90 72.62 A: you know the money's good especially if you know you can use it for a lot of things but i look at it this way if i have a 

72.80 80.99 A: good friend a really really good friend you know even though it's hard i'd rather take the friendship over the money 

73.80 74.66 B: (( uh-huh )) 

80.22 82.54 B: yeah it would be i mean it depends on 

82.68 91.96 B: how i mean obviously a close friend you know like say your best friend like i got friends that that i've had for years you know since i've been in high school and stuff and you know 

89.06 90.84 A: (( yeah )) 

91.13 92.90 A: yeah 

92.02 99.71 B: and and like ten fifteen years you know that's kind of hard to give up even for money because money you can always get you know 

95.70 97.43 A: oh yeah 

98.90 101.86 A: oh yeah yeah that's true and i mean if the 

100.26 102.48 B: and friendship you really can't give up you know 

102.33 113.78 A: oh yeah and you know the thing about it is you could have that money and then al- all of a sudden you have a whole group of p- p- peop- people that want to flock around you but those aren't your true friends your true friends are those who've been with you for years 

109.04 110.04 B: yeah 

113.61 128.41 A: 'cause i'm just like you i have friends that i i've known for ten years and up and been through everything and i you know i wouldn't trade them for anything in the world because i know when it comes to it they've been there for me from day one 

117.57 118.51 B: yeah 

128.52 131.05 B: yeah it's kind of a i'm sorry go ahead 

128.90 132.45 A: and i had i had nothing you know so 

131.45 140.52 B: yeah it's kind of important because i mean like real friends are real good friends are hard to find you know and i think i think uh a real friend you know 

139.38 140.83 A: mhm 

140.49 148.35 B: i mean i don't think any any of my friends would do it would take a million dollars over my friendship i would hope not you know i 

146.96 150.33 A: yeah i'm i'm the same as you i hope the same thing too 

148.81 149.95 B: mean i mean 

150.04 161.36 B: you can never really know if you get into that that situation well you know 'cause some friends 'cause i have some friends that really like money you know and they really and it would really change their situation to have a million dollars to play with you know 

153.21 155.04 A: (( yeah )) 

156.54 157.20 A: (( oh )) 

158.63 164.43 A: yeah yeah i know i know it it isn't you know that's a that's a 

164.34 176.28 A: be kind of a hard situation there it's like you know that you wouldn't do it yourself but if you knew your friends really well then you know you would like you said you hope they wouldn't choose the money over you 

168.65 169.90 B: (( yeah )) 

173.89 174.67 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

176.31 187.00 B: 'cause a million dollars can solve a lot of things i mean a lot of problems and for some people i mean the way way a million dollars they can always get new friends you know or whatever you know what i'm saying but [noise] 

176.48 177.53 A: (( you know )) 

185.26 191.83 A: yeah and and and the thing about it is is that when it goes like that you don't want it that way 

191.64 201.00 A: you don't want it because you know that those type of people are only around you because of the money that you have that's it you know and what's to say the thing is you could eas- 

196.28 198.05 B: oh yeah of course [noise] 

200.80 210.24 A: you could get the m- the million dollars that easily but then you can lose it just as quick and then if you lose it will those people still be there which i know 

205.47 206.38 B: yeah 

210.28 214.95 A: in my opinion they won't be there 'cause once they know the money's gone that's it 

210.34 211.18 B: yeah 

212.20 213.44 B: yeah me too 

214.23 220.16 B: because i mean like i don't know it's uh it's our biggest kind of comment on society 'cause i think a lot of people would 

220.17 226.05 B: i i think if you genuinely asked a lot of people whoever's calling us up besides us is like they prib- prob- 

224.49 225.74 A: (( mhm oh )) 

225.86 239.43 B: you know would say they actually would take the money and because i mean some people have like you know a mill- uh like you know a thousand friends and they go you know well well one less friend you know one pers- specific friend may not you know 

228.52 233.30 A: (( yeah [noise] yeah [noise] oh yeah )) 

239.38 246.54 B: affect me whatever or or you know depending on what who they have to choose or whatever or the or the situation and circumstances but 

243.79 245.66 A: (( oh yeah )) 

246.37 254.99 A: i mean and you're right you're a hundred percent correct with that because i know some people that yeah could just say that i'm just acquaintances with i'm not like 

253.57 254.35 B: (( mm yeah like )) 

255.59 269.07 A: real tight with them and all and i just know the way their personality ticks that it's you know that chance was given to them oh they they'd drop you like a ha- a bad habit and take the money [noise] 

256.46 258.61 B: yeah like you're like my best buddy 

267.85 271.15 B: well i just an- and i like some of my even you know 

271.29 274.28 B: i have some friends that like you know sometimes friends 

274.18 287.48 B: they um you know they're your friends so you don't judge them be- but you know they they have they can be not of not not of the best type of people you know but they happen to be your friend because that's the way they are like i have a friend i know a friend i've known for a long time who's 

281.84 283.92 A: yeah yeah 

287.00 290.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

287.28 300.98 B: a a pathological liar he just loves to lie all the time about any- anything but yet that's my friend that's that's the way he is and i i accept him for who he is and i know when he's lying and i know that he's lying most of the time so you know 

292.01 293.69 A: yeah 

300.21 302.42 A: yeah [laughter] 

300.77 303.24 B: so when he tells me something i i can usually say 

303.12 308.54 B: okay wh- what's worth the truth in that you know but yeah and maybe for him you know 

306.06 307.23 A: yeah 

308.39 317.45 B: some people like well that with that kind of friend i don't really need that kind of friend around you know i mean even even though you know i mean what kind of person is he what what do you mean uh but even though 

312.45 313.75 A: exactly 

317.30 330.90 B: he's like that he's still a friend because i know you know he's he's a buddy who'll always be there whatever you know and like he you know even though he might have faults in his character you know we all have faults in in in our characters so you know 

321.69 323.50 A: yeah 

328.27 339.59 A: oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah because i have friends just like that too that i mean you know we're we're tight as like i said we're tight as anything and i know that they have some bad habits 

339.25 340.33 B: yeah 

339.46 348.73 A: but the thing about it is is that is they upset me sometimes but you know but some of the things that they do or the decisions that they make but no matter what 

349.22 350.83 B: they're still your friends uh 

349.28 357.42 A: they still have a lot of good characteristics so you know and and you know and i know that they'll do anything for me so 

351.26 353.43 B: good qualities yeah yeah 

357.84 361.06 A: you know that i could always overlook 

360.17 363.49 B: yeah i mean a real friend i i i always think i mean 

363.58 364.68 A: mhm 

363.60 376.18 B: real a real friend i mean that you it's very rare to have friends who last a long time and because friends got to they come and go you know and then like you know situations people might see theirselves 

376.06 390.96 B: in different light you know like some friends might be doing well better than other friends and then they s- their other friends felt left out you know it's like well i don't you know i don't know where i stand with my buddies or whatever you know because maybe i'm doing well but they're not or maybe they're doing well but i'm not you know 

377.99 379.32 A: (( [noise] [noise] [cough] )) 

379.86 381.58 A: yeah 

382.40 384.28 A: yeah 

388.99 389.70 A: yeah 

390.36 391.86 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

390.87 402.65 B: and some it just might change the the the uh the way the situ- the friendship is is based on how it well you know i mean what do you base your friendship on and people it's like it's a that's a weird weird question you know like 

401.95 414.69 A: y- yeah [noise] it's it's sure it's it's a it's a whole difficult situation because you know you have you like you said you're in a situation where you may have one or two friends that are doing better than you 

414.38 415.17 B: (( mm )) 

414.72 417.08 A: [noise] so y- y- you were like man 

417.07 430.16 A: you you feel like the odd person out but you know i've had friends that you know have doing pretty good for themselves but the thing about it is is that they still don't exclude me [noise] 

429.94 432.96 A: they don't make me feel uncomfortable in any way 

432.99 446.72 A: [noise] so in that sense you know i don't feel like that you know and you know firstly i don't let it really bother me but sometimes you know when you're struggling it's kind of like ugh [noise] you know but i still 

433.07 433.86 B: mm 

443.85 445.36 B: yeah 

446.76 451.14 A: still wouldn't give the i still wouldn't give them up for the million dollars though 

449.99 453.62 B: yeah no but i mean like since the since the question was 

453.43 466.07 B: if if uh you know if if a benefactor would give you the money and and then the million dollars you know you never they wouldn't be able to speak see his friend it was was it ever again that what the question was ever again 

457.93 458.71 A: mhm 

466.19 474.62 A: yeah it would you something like would you ju- just stay with the million dollars and give up that friendship 

472.01 472.86 B: mm 

474.17 479.87 B: because i think also as i mean they know it will also be kind of quick curious to find out 

475.29 480.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

479.66 490.37 B: why this benefactor would be giving you this kind of money i mean what what would what what you know i would i would be really curious as to why they would want me to give up my friendship with a certain person you know 

490.05 492.82 A: (( yeah 'cause it it sounds sounds )) 

490.58 497.95 B: because maybe they maybe they have their own designs on that on that person maybe they like want to do something good or bad with that person or they just 

497.82 501.23 B: or like say for instance you have a best friend who's a girl 

501.01 502.77 A: (( yeah )) 

501.09 510.47 B: and and you know the benefactor happens to be her father maybe he doesn't want he doesn't like your sort you know he doesn't like how you hang out with with her with his daughter you know 

510.30 511.90 A: exactly 

510.33 517.59 B: but you don't know but you still don't know who it is and it's like maybe your best friend sometimes the best friendships well certainly with females 

516.94 518.78 A: mhm 

517.46 519.38 B: can turn out to be like you know 

519.25 533.27 B: be like the women at the you know the the women that you're always supposed to you know should have always been with you know like your best like if you do you know the person you see you're supposed to marry and all that you know so like if you give up that friendship you'll never know what happened maybe she'll go on and marry up 

529.65 531.67 A: (( yeah )) 

533.13 539.64 B: marry somebody else and then you didn't you never knew you know that you would have married her or something maybe down the line or whatever 

534.72 536.52 A: yeah 

539.35 541.03 A: true true 

539.79 544.20 B: and then it ya- you're but pre- the benefactor broke it up you know so 

544.14 555.15 A: exactly 'cause i mean just when you look at it a benefactor doesn't give a million dollars unless it's out of the kindness of his heart or he's and that's one way 

551.47 552.22 B: mm 

554.92 563.93 A: but then usually nobody like that just comes up and says hey i'm just going to give you a million dollars without a reason behind it without without a motive 

561.67 562.93 B: yeah a million dollars 

563.44 565.40 B: a million dollars i mean sh- 

565.20 566.57 A: [laughter] 

565.68 568.30 B: that's just that's not no uh you know 

568.14 569.87 A: small things 

568.75 572.33 B: yeah i mean you could do a lot of things with a million dollars too so [noise] 

571.91 584.71 A: yeah that's true that's true and then it's like you know it's just a sense of like what type of morals do you have it's a if it's like you're willing to just say all right i'm just going to drop everything that i value 

578.32 579.24 B: mm 

585.42 599.89 A: to me just to have that million dollars you know and it's it- it's like yeah it it's a temptation because you know you're like wow i can take care of my death pay it all off don't have to worry about it and still have enough money to 

588.50 590.30 B: yeah i mean it's
