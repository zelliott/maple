14.93 15.92 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

15.87 19.93 B: the high divorce rates in the united states and whether or not they affect 

20.17 25.53 B: um my opinion of marriage and i would say probably yeah definitely 

26.85 27.74 B: um 

27.97 30.25 B: would affect my opinion of marriage 

30.75 34.33 B: 'cause uh what marriage is traditionally uh 

35.23 36.78 B: [noise] right um 

36.96 37.82 B: you know 

38.19 43.76 B: [mn] used for for institution of family to provide like a structure for kids and stuff 

43.64 44.46 A: (( uh-huh )) 

45.20 47.28 B: guess that's how i feel and then 

48.36 49.31 B: um 

50.03 56.16 B: you know if if marriages are are are just ending you know at the hi- at the rate they are 

56.19 64.40 B: then then they're gonna like that same sort of feature as it used to kind of a security of twenty thirty years 

61.13 61.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

64.96 66.60 B: for it to have that sort of 

68.03 71.32 B: and what do you think about like what what a marriage is supposed to be 

71.59 76.28 A: i think a marriage is based solely it's on love and trust and as long as you have that then 

76.47 78.66 A: i think you're fine um 

78.32 79.47 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

79.70 81.80 A: divorce i think should be 

82.41 87.73 A: like a last resort not necessarily the first thing you jump to it should be a last resort 

88.49 89.66 A: and 

90.20 96.54 A: i don't know if divorce i mean if the number of divorces affect marriages i don't know if that's true but 

95.96 98.54 B: mhm 

98.15 103.54 A: i think that i think that marriage is just you know something when you get married you do it for the long haul 

103.80 107.31 A: and i think that that's that's the mindset you should walk in with at least 

108.66 111.11 B: (( okay so um [lipsmack] )) 

109.11 109.67 A: (( [mn] )) 

111.20 120.00 B: you you're you said that you think uh marriage is definitely for the long haul [mn] do you think that um that people 

116.13 117.14 A: yeah 

120.27 123.78 B: people that are getting married in in america now uh 

124.26 127.71 B: think that they're they're gonna be married for their entire lives 

127.56 132.22 A: well yeah otherwise they wouldn't get married you know they they think that this is the one and this is the only one 

132.45 133.34 B: right 

132.61 140.57 A: and you really never know when you're going in but you know you hope you like i say the world you know life is unpredictable you you just book in with the best intentions 

140.72 141.90 B: right 

141.41 142.95 A: to be together forever 

142.60 156.11 B: mhm so like so like why would you have [sigh] why would you have um like lower divorce rates in other countries is it just because of the freedoms that that americans have in in choosing 

144.08 145.02 A: and 

156.21 157.63 B: you know if they wanna 

156.45 158.21 A: (( yeah )) 

158.52 162.42 A: yeah i believe in other countries aren't there like arranged marriages and stuff like that 

163.22 164.27 A: and 

163.43 165.02 B: what's that 

164.39 167.76 A: i said i believe in other countries they might be arranged marriages and 

167.27 169.24 B: right yeah there are like in uh 

168.62 173.96 A: yeah um but i've heard they work out that those are more successful than regular marriages but 

173.51 174.80 B: right i heard that too 

174.12 182.82 A: and they they yeah they might actually be because they are under you know obligation not necessarily love i mean sometimes they grow to love the person that they're with but other times they don't 

182.76 184.00 B: mhm 

182.84 189.15 A: and it's it's mainly out of obligation but the laws here are different to the laws there and and 

189.37 199.86 A: you know divorce here to some people i mean some religious people it is a big deal like catholics won't get divorced because of how they feel it makes them look to god or what have you and others 

199.27 200.90 B: yeah 

199.73 212.74 A: (( can others can do it freely with no problem you know it's just it's all about your personal beliefs when it comes to divorce and marriage and stuff like that how you were rai- how you were raised and what you were taught to believe in and what you personally believe in yourself yeah )) 

207.48 208.47 B: mhm 

212.65 219.83 B: mhm [mn] um but do you think that um i think i agree with [mn] like all those all those things do you think that 

220.16 221.37 B: (( like since )) 

221.30 224.60 B: since people are are and since am- america 

224.46 234.69 B: it's uh you know a different scene for for like uh what kinda freedoms if you like you have do you think that that that that people should adjust like the way 

234.55 240.23 B: the the the way that they get married and it should be like [sigh] people should um [sigh] 

240.28 243.91 B: you know feel like they need they need a little more um 

243.83 251.63 B: a litt- a little a little [mn] you know know each other a little more or or something needs to be changed about the way [sigh] we approach marriages so that 

251.53 265.36 B: so that they have the the sort of a more more uh strength to them you know 'cause i have i have a mother who's been married like four times and and i think that it's like just just 'cause she's given this freedom to in her life to do 

265.21 277.02 B: whatever she wants basically [sigh] she she um the the marriage the the bond of marriage doesn't really mean as much to her as like well there isn't anything to keep it going 

277.31 283.73 B: so like i f- i feel like there's gotta be some way that like our our society should evolve 

283.76 286.71 B: to to make t- to make marriages have 

286.75 293.96 B: more lasting power 'cause people 'cause of the you know just 'cause we have we live in a different society than other societies that 

293.83 302.15 B: you know the lasting power of a marriage might be guaranteed by the fact that it's looked down upon so much to get divorced or there's religious implications or something you know 

294.02 294.79 A: yeah 

302.12 303.36 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

303.60 312.01 B: so do you think it's like the the that it just naturally will evolve [mn] in our culture or do you think that things need to be done like legally or [sigh] 

312.04 317.83 A: well i don't think there's anything you can do legally you can't force people to stay married i mean people i mean when people try to get divorced 

318.08 326.99 A: go to counsellors to make sure that they've done everything they can to make the marriage work before they actually grant a divorce or or an annulment or whatever they have and 

327.22 337.61 A: like i said legally they can't make you do anything if you don't want to be married to someone they can't they can't force you to stay i mean they do make they do you know some people can't afford divorces so they wind up just separating but 

331.57 332.48 B: yeah 

337.25 338.95 B: right right yeah 

338.35 339.25 A: (( you know )) 

339.54 347.85 A: legally there isn't much they can do you just it's like i said it's a personal thing you just have to some people who get married believe that this is it so they're gonna do whatever it takes 

348.01 356.34 A: to make that marriage work you know if that if that means moving with them or changing the way they are 

350.96 351.82 B: mhm 

356.60 359.01 A: or eliminating certain people from their lives 

359.20 365.21 A: to make their marriage work then they're gonna do it and others will just give up the first chance you 

366.18 371.02 A: (( know rest of it i don't think i don't think you should be rushing into marriage i mean )) 

366.34 367.58 B: yeah 

368.43 369.21 B: yeah 

371.50 377.34 A: you should definitely definitely take your time i mean this also you know people fall in love at first sight and all that stuff but 

377.73 380.92 A: but i think you should definitely take your time because 

381.07 393.54 A: i don't think that that's some- you don't you don't wanna have that kind of baggage on you you know it's like you said with your mother four marriages that's that's a lot of baggage and you know it it kinda loses its specialness if you keep getting if you get married that many times it loses its 

394.28 398.78 A: you know the specialness of it of of of the sanctity of marriage it just loses it 

396.05 396.86 B: yeah 

398.40 400.74 B: exactly yeah i agree 

399.78 401.94 A: yeah and 

401.17 404.44 B: so you believe in uh love at first sight then 

404.87 410.98 A: not really no but i'm not 'cause i've never experienced it i mean it probably can happen but i've never experienced it you know but i've heard people who have 

406.32 407.14 B: (( not really )) 

409.83 410.63 B: yeah 

411.07 419.99 A: and when they say it i just i just nod my head and i'm happy for them you know i i leave it like that i don't judge them but people do say it happens and it happens to them 

411.20 412.13 B: right 

418.28 418.84 B: (( [mn] )) 

420.06 421.06 A: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

420.23 425.82 B: yeah yeah seems like a very romantic idea like not very practical [mn] 

425.49 432.59 A: yeah yeah i mean [mn] you know anything in this world is possible it's just it depends on you know i believe in lust at first i don't think anybody falls in 

432.35 440.57 A: you're falling in love with the person you're looking at not necessarily the person they are because that love comes behind knowing the person one hundred per cent no matter we- well as much as you can 

439.70 440.51 B: right 

440.96 444.01 A: (( the person not the way they look you know what i mean )) 

443.00 443.85 B: uh-huh 

444.11 450.58 A: 'cause you know you could you could think you fall in love with someone you're looking at for the first time and they'd be a completely you know horrible person 

444.19 445.03 B: yeah 

450.62 455.16 A: so then you really aren't in love you just was attracted to 'em when you first met them 

454.51 456.20 B: mhm 

455.65 456.47 A: so 

457.14 460.15 A: it's just i think it's lust at first sight not necessarily love 

460.27 464.29 B: (( yeah yeah yeah i definitely would ha- i think i would agree with you on that )) 

463.60 464.97 A: yeah 

465.80 468.06 B: [mn] so so uh
