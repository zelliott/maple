350.03 356.89 A: oh that's no problem just ask like any like any ah like kids or i'm sure 

355.84 366.11 B: yeah that's what i i got a lot of the um well nephews and they're you know high school and going into college and i usually end up calling them and asking them what the heck do i have to do 

359.76 360.74 A: uh-huh 

362.61 363.55 A: uh-huh

368.45 369.50 A: uh-huh 

374.63 375.58 A: uh-huh 

376.99 387.16 A: yeah that that's very true yeah i think that's ah like um like berkley like it's a really competitive school where are you calling from the u. penn 

387.38 389.10 B: i'm calling from arizona 

389.41 392.69 A: [noise] oh wait i thought is this like a research for u. penn 

393.45 398.00 B: ah yeah you're right yeah mhm yeah university of pennsylvania right 

395.46 396.69 A: oh okay 

397.50 399.34 A: oh okay um 

399.35 405.28 A: yeah so like a lot of like i've heard people drop out of school because like you know like they kept like 

405.05 414.94 A: playing games and like you know they're so like they're addicted to the game and you know that's really bad and i heard people that dropped out where like you know they put they got put like on 

414.74 421.45 A: acad- like academic probation and like it's pretty bad yeah yeah yeah a lot of them actually 

417.47 418.64 B: oh really 

421.39 422.94 B: it's that bad 

421.65 434.39 A: like i know i yeah i know there's one in my dorm you know like i think this maybe will help your research um i think people tend to increase the amount of um computer games that they play in college 

434.41 438.04 A: because they get high speed connection internet 

437.99 439.01 B: uh-huh 

438.23 448.76 A: and that's the one big factor that will you know cause people to play more because at home you can only play like with yourselves like with the software you know that you get 

448.57 452.54 A: but then once you get to college unless like you know like i mean 

452.37 463.90 A: our generation like most people don't have like super fast like s- like c- internet connections yet but i'm sure the next generation will like they will have that available 

463.74 473.58 A: or like to them you know at home but therefore ours is like more like you know we got to college and then man like you know internet provides so much for us and like 

473.37 480.00 A: people who play computer games just realize you know you can play with your friends online you know so they tend to play like non stop 

477.60 479.35 B: mhm 

480.16 489.39 B: yeah i think that i find it pretty amazing where you can like you just mentioned playing over the internet you can play with somebody you know that's ah over on the east coast you're on the west coast 

485.04 486.10 A: yeah 

487.35 494.33 A: yeah i mean you can yeah you can play here for and like play with some person from you know from like italy or something 

491.93 492.85 B: yeah 

494.28 498.01 B: well there's one thing i i'm i'm also i like to play chess 

497.82 499.35 A: oh okay 

498.42 510.00 B: and that's one thing i i'm i'm kinda curious i haven't played the computer chess game yet um but i'm i'm interested in looking in into that 'cause you like you say you can play people overseas 

503.20 504.37 A: uh-huh 

507.18 508.54 A: uh-huh you 

509.85 517.24 A: yeah yeah oh you know what there's a have you been on to yahoo website like the games yeah like there is like 

510.46 511.58 B: and 

514.63 517.89 B: yeah right uh-huh yeah i've seen that 

517.83 520.85 A: there is like bridge there's you know um 

521.05 530.37 A: there's all kinds of game there's goldfish there's like hearts there's um you know black jack there's you know even like the chinese mah jong there you know [lipsmack] it's really fun 

530.91 532.08 B: (( hm )) 

531.02 538.57 A: like i used to like when i was bored [laughter] back in high school like i would go online and play bridge it's really fun [lipsmack] 

538.75 545.11 A: 'cause you know like with the computer it gets boring because like a lot of times you can w- like you can easily win 

544.94 558.74 A: but then with people you know like on the other side like whoever they are there's a you know intellectual just like you and you know there are different type of rooms like you can go to ah if you know that you're not too good then you can go to beginners or more like intermediate 

558.56 562.86 B: [laughter] i i think i like that i think that's fair that's the way it should be 

558.99 559.97 A: and 

561.28 563.74 A: yeah and then you know what's really cool like 

563.68 577.91 A: like when you're playing the game they offer you like a space on the bottom and then you can type in whatever you wanna say so at the same time it's like a game room versus like like a chat room so it's like a lot of interaction going on so that's 

570.38 571.25 B: uh-huh 

577.74 589.45 A: that's part of the reason why it's successful you know the game yeah [noise] yeah and i think that in general so like there are lots of bored people out there you know they have nothing better to do so they'll just play games 

579.87 583.15 B: mhm i'll have to look into that 

586.31 590.61 B: (( [laughter] )) 

589.50 590.78 A: right i think 

591.13 599.17 A: eventually end up that way but then right now there's too much going on in college so i prefer not to waste my time on those stuff yeah [noise] 

597.39 599.18 B: yeah 

599.31 599.89 B: well
