0.23 1.54 A: hello 

1.09 2.44 B: hello 

1.62 3.40 A: (( hi this hi this is scott )) 

3.26 4.98 B: hi scott this is sean 

4.82 5.79 A: (( hi sean )) 

5.81 7.08 B: how you doing 

6.53 12.08 A: doing well so so what's your take on showing criminal justice things on t._v. 

12.36 15.42 B: um i actually don't think they should be shown 

16.21 17.51 A: okay [mn] 

16.96 19.57 B: because it it tends to uh 

20.36 28.16 B: leave an unfair bias in the uh jury's opi- in jury opinion because a jury can just go home and see the whole thing on t._v. 

28.60 39.55 A: but i i i mean like cases like o._j.'s a- again they weren't supposed to go and watch television they weren't supposed to do anything in regards to the trial 

39.58 52.65 A: so who's i mean it made that jury look worse because they made the decision they made and everyone in the nation saw the trial so they saw how ludicrous their decision was 

52.81 54.03 B: right 

53.89 60.87 A: so i i i i i mean i understand your point and i can either go either way on this especially in trials where you know 

60.76 68.14 A: who i felt bad for when the when the trial was displayed in you know in front of everyone was the family of the victims 

67.94 76.32 A: not so much the way the outcome of the trial was 'cause i don't think it would've made any difference if it was tried through the media or not 

76.12 84.57 A: in aspect of the o._j. case but it really was horrific for the the victim's family to be you know pulled through that 

84.23 85.54 B: i agree 

85.76 93.59 A: so i mean i i don't i really don't know where i lie on it i mean 'cause i really do 'cause like the laci peterson case is coming up 

93.59 98.20 A: i mean i would really like to see what was going on in the case 

98.18 111.07 A: and i don't think it would really affect the jury that much but i think it would be more horrific for the family that had to go through it that everyone knows what was going on 

111.05 118.51 A: and and [laughter] if you're asking me to take a side on it i don't know if i could but 'cause i i mean i see the pros and cons of both sides on this 

119.18 125.14 B: well i agree with your point i agree that it's gonna be hur- it's dragging the family through it 

125.51 133.56 B: um more or less and and they have to hear every detail of what's going on when i don't think that they should have to 

133.45 135.54 A: right 

134.34 135.56 B: um 

135.87 145.07 B: as far as a high [mn] a big high profile case i really don't think that the laci peterson case is gonna be as high profile as the o._j. case was 

145.11 147.45 A: and i agree with that 

146.15 152.38 B: um i i'm actually here in california so out here it's a big deal as far as nat- 

151.21 153.14 A: and i'm in los angeles myself so 

153.08 157.31 B: so and nationwide i mean somebody from the east coast might not care 

157.94 167.08 A: right well y- i i there's no way this will be as big as the o._j. case because he was you know a you know a a figure of you know not even just a sports figure he was an entertainment figure 

158.08 158.98 B: so 

166.96 175.14 A: so i mean if you were looking at cases like that the i mean there's what what's the case that uh the the mu- the music mogul guy who just killed someone 

173.98 176.15 B: oh the shug night case 

176.24 181.00 A: there's that and there's the guy who was the producer who killed the girl in his castle 

180.77 181.72 B: uh 

181.12 187.83 A: who's coming up yeah phil spector i mean all these cases but 

181.76 183.75 B: uh the phil spector case 

187.85 196.14 A: does it come down to does it affect the jury and i don't know if it actually does affect the jury one way or another because i do you do 

194.85 199.06 B: well i believe that you know most everybody has a t._v. 

199.34 201.57 B: in america there's 

200.29 201.88 A: mhm 

201.59 208.32 B: i i don't believe i know anyone or have known anybody who absolutely doesn't have a t._v. 

208.73 217.42 B: in some way shape or form in their car a hand held on their cellphone you know everybody's got a t._v. right now 

216.43 218.78 A: mhm 

218.06 222.15 B: so if you're in a jury and you're told not to watch t._v. 

223.01 232.77 B: somebody's gonna watch t._v. anyway they're gonna go home they're gonna watch their favorite program or whatever they're gonna get t._v. however they're gonna get it 

231.82 234.29 A: mhm 

232.98 235.54 B: the know matter what they tell 'em 

235.68 236.73 B: um 

236.81 240.57 B: they're gonna go home and watch t._v. anyway and they might get 

240.86 245.54 B: an unbiased opinion that might influence their decision to the jury 

246.74 255.21 A: y- i i guess it depends on the jury because r- remember the o._j. jury was sequestered so they were monitored on their television they could watch 

250.59 251.64 B: (( mhm )) 

255.49 256.41 B: hm 

255.54 258.81 A: and they still came back with their decision which 

258.85 263.35 A: i you know i don't i don't know how you fall on this but i think that was a very biased decision they came back with 

263.18 275.38 A: i think they came back with their own agenda without regard of what they saw through the media because i think the media was very much geared for o._j. to be convicted and it was a huge shock when he wasn't 

274.67 276.59 B: exactly i agree with you 

277.02 291.53 A: so i mean in in regards to that they they i mean they didn't even have the benefit of t._v. to watch and they still made the decision they made and i [laughter] guess you it's almost believing an argument that it's better to have you know 

291.49 301.15 A: everyone else saying hey this is what we think but i mean that's not how our jury system works because you can't even talk about the case but they came back with a decision that was 

301.24 306.59 A: way off of what everyone else thought they were gonna come back with from people who actually saw the trial 

306.72 308.51 B: right 

307.96 309.00 A: so 

309.55 322.03 A: i mean but again i think that's an anomaly because most juries aren't sequestered most juries like you say do get to go home and watch television do get to see the outside influences 

321.85 330.54 A: so i i again i mean i'm not trying to to speak to any side of this because i i i think i could see the pros and cons of both ways on these sorts of arguments 

331.72 335.16 B: right [lipsmack] i just see that you know 

335.97 337.76 B: most everybody 

338.27 348.55 B: at least that i know gets most all of their information on the world and what's going on from t._v. very few get it from newspapers or other sources 

347.18 349.96 A: mhm 

348.82 350.01 B: um 

350.36 353.35 B: and since they get all their information that way 

353.72 357.40 B: uh the average person that goes into a 

357.77 358.71 B: uh 

360.17 365.77 B: a trial for jury service there's apathy there because they've most people don't wanna do it 

365.25 366.93 A: right 

366.46 375.07 B: um so they're gonna go h- into the jury they're gonna go home and they're gonna watch t._v. and they're gonna get a biased opinion and they're gonna bring it back 

375.74 380.60 B: to the whatever jury if they h- you know if they have to go for more than one day 

381.19 391.82 A: okay but i i mean we're we're we're talk- we're talking about okay first of all we're talking about minority of the trials 

382.90 384.50 B: most peop- but 

392.37 394.05 A: anybody's even interested in 

393.85 398.54 A: [laughter] i mean the bottom line is that most trials that you would be called to serve 

398.41 410.40 A: uh jury duty on no one cares what happens really i mean it's not it's not gonna go to t._v. it's not gonna no one's very i mean even probably's very little even written into the newspaper it's just the high profile cases 

401.36 402.48 B: exactly 

410.32 421.50 A: that we're talking about i mean that that what is it top one percent of the top percent so i mean it it's it's such a you know first of all we're talking about such a you know a few 

414.56 415.71 B: right 

421.65 433.08 A: or a minority of the cases i mean there's like laci peterson there's like like phil spector i mean there's a handful of cases where this type of publicity could influence the outcome of a trial 

433.46 438.19 A: now i don't think it def- it necessarily affects 

438.63 442.55 A: the public's best interests whether a trial's shown or not because 

442.48 455.58 A: it's all done for entertainment at that point i th- i think everyone watched o._j. for you know to be able to talk around the water cooler hey what do you think of this so in that aspect w- 

455.51 463.39 A: should we be entertained over someone else's pain and i i think that definitely is a no but 

463.54 468.86 A: the argument that the jury's affected i i still have a problem with that just because 

474.21 481.85 A: one the o._j. jury it didn't matter if if they were affected or not they they they elected to go against public sentiment 

481.73 495.49 A: two that i guess the public sentiment in the the scott peterson and laci peterson case is that he's guilty and he can't get a fair trial where he's at in that aspect i'd kinda like to see that i'd like to see 

495.66 503.47 A: as a nation or just as a interested party if his defense puts up a strong case 

504.17 512.99 A: and it still comes back as guilty that's just as bad as what happened in the o._j. case wouldn't you agree on that 

512.16 521.75 B: yeah i'd agree but i think actually with um given public sentiment in california they might actually move that case to a different courtroom 

522.62 535.02 A: oh it would definitely make sense to do that because i mean if he's tried there he's already convicted you know he's already hung on this one and and honestly i think he's guilty i mean that's just my idea coming in on what i've seen but 

535.62 547.57 A: i i don't think there's any way he's gonna get a fair get a fair case there and if i was scott peterson i would and and and i was innocent i would want this shown on tv [noise] i'd want everybody in the world to see this 

547.99 560.18 B: i agree with you because if he had nothing to hide there would be no reason for him to lay low and and try and almost hide from the media but if he was innocent he would 

557.41 559.21 A: right 

560.45 566.65 B: i mean he would want to be inviting media over you know telling them everything that he knew 

564.29 565.16 A: (( ex- )) 

567.72 568.79 A: yeah so 

567.79 574.74 B: and cons- you know cons- uh what's the word i'm looking for consenting to any test they've come up with 

574.84 578.29 B: because he's innocent he would have nothing to hide 

579.65 581.84 A: right so 

582.01 592.59 A: in that aspect okay okay so what you're saying then if if you were him you would want the world a- and if you were him and you got tried where where's he from barstow sacramento somewhere 

586.16 586.91 B: (( mm )) 

592.70 593.63 A: um 

594.21 599.39 A: you would want more than just the local media looking at this trial 

599.34 599.89 B: oh
