23.08 36.36 A: oh yeah um i love movies uh i guess the thing i l- i like about renting a movie is that you can just stay at home and you know do whatever if you gotta get up and get something to eat or 

35.78 37.61 B: exactly yeah 

36.61 38.21 A: whatnot you know 

37.76 42.73 B: or if you miss something you can rewind it back and [laughter] and see what you missed

75.25 76.49 B: yeah 

75.85 79.12 A: my mom told me about that she said it was pretty depressing 

79.26 85.25 B: m- [laughter] yeah you know [laughter] it's not depressing though see i guess it's it just depends on how you look at it 

80.41 81.39 A: [laughter] 

81.65 82.85 A: really 

84.90 86.18 A: yeah 

85.57 95.74 B: it wasn't you know i had a friend you know and he watched the movie and he said the same thing but it was very uplifting if you ask me [laughter] i guess you 

90.66 91.74 A: really 

92.77 97.27 A: hm i guess it's all under your outlook of things 

96.92 105.69 B: yeah 'cause uh you know it it is it's kind of depressing but then it kinda shows you that you know there is good things in life and uh 

106.04 114.36 B: and then y- i- i- it's actually great you know it is kind of depressing but you know and then but at the end it's it's it's a wake up call you know 

108.25 109.12 A: (( [noise] )) 

113.94 115.29 A: mhm 

114.55 122.57 B: it's a wake up call then you you you you will understand that your you know that your life isn't a pile of shit like you know everybody tries to tell you 

120.67 121.49 A: (( mm )) 

122.17 123.65 A: [laughter] 

122.98 132.39 B: and y- you know and i think it's a great movie this is you know it's amazing 'cause my friends both said you know it's too depressing and i'm all it wasn't depressing at all [laughter] 

131.13 139.25 A: hm yeah i guess seeing movies like that kinda make you realize that you know some guy or some lady always has it worse than you do 

138.93 140.26 B: that's right 

139.65 141.04 A: [laughter] 

140.40 142.38 B: yeah that's that's the way it is 

141.83 143.18 A: yeah 

142.59 155.29 B: that that's that's exactly you know i sit here and i you know i'm so pissed off about so many damn things and and then but when you really realize it that you know it there's things that could be way worse [laughter] 

148.75 149.49 A: (( mm )) 

154.43 157.10 A: oh yeah uh-huh i

175.60 178.36 B: that's right that's right 

177.72 185.27 A: ah yeah you know um it's nice to run down the road and i tried the vegetarian thing for a while but 

185.57 193.32 A: i just felt hungry after i ate all the time but you know i can totally respect that but hey you know each to each to his own 

193.36 194.58 B: yeah

218.78 219.64 A: yeah 

222.76 229.75 B: you know if there is a god whatever you know then then god didn't put them on earth to be treated like shit 

229.48 231.60 A: [cough] no i don't 

230.45 234.64 B: anyway but anyway going back to the movie thing [laughter] 

233.06 244.36 A: know [laughter] well let's see it just seems so much uh easier to go out and rent a movie i mean they got this uh these this website that's uh net flex dot com 

244.34 249.46 A: can go on there and rent uh as many movies as you want for twenty dollars a month 

249.25 250.59 B: yeah 

249.84 253.88 A: seems to be a pretty good deal i mean the whole thing with the uh 

254.36 258.95 A: i guess the copyright uh infringement or whatever you can't really 

259.43 265.86 A: go online and do all that stuff anymore but um it it just seems a whole lot easier to uh 

265.98 271.43 A: to t- to go rent a movie you're not uh you can see it when you want to you don't have to uh 

271.93 282.20 A: abide by somebody else's schedule you know and you know you don't have to sit in the movie theater you know too hot or too cold or you gotta get up and go piss 

274.89 276.22 B: yeah 

282.15 286.68 B: well y- well [laughter] yeah but i mean if it weren't so expensive it 

282.37 283.24 A: uh 

285.62 288.21 A: oh well that too i mean 

287.18 295.14 B: you know if it if it were cheaper then i would definitely do it i mean it's it's kind of nice to get out but it's just too expensive 

290.38 291.59 A: [laughter] 

294.69 302.66 A: it is and you know the some of the subject material they have out now there's just not no creativity it seems like 

302.50 303.54 B: yeah 

302.69 305.76 A: like there's just some real crap out there now and 

305.31 317.49 B: um well you know sometimes i like crap but [laughter] i i'm not really you know sometimes you know i like the like uh whatever what what was it spiderman 

309.05 310.38 A: [laughter] 

317.12 318.54 A: oh yeah yeah 

317.86 325.27 B: that that yeah you you to me that's a you know it's a stupid movie but it was it was kind of creative and i liked watching it it was entertaining 

324.13 324.94 A: yeah 

325.02 326.01 A: uh-huh 

326.04 334.07 B: i don't necessarily have to uh like i think i would like the hulk too if i went and you know saw it i think i would like that too 

333.74 342.93 A: it's it's good it it doesn't really get good until about the last uh hour but um the first hour kind of drags on but the second hour is 

343.09 345.12 A: it's really really good but uh 

344.15 349.10 B: what about um like uh you know arnold uh terminator three oh 

348.57 351.13 A: yeah i'm uh anxiously awaiting that 

350.52 354.92 B: of course 'cause i love arnold [laughter] he's a great guy 

352.68 353.98 A: oh yeah 

354.13 364.93 A: i mean there's some movies that are worth paying full price for like uh saw the matrix reloaded uh that was good yeah yeah it was good 

361.88 363.33 B: and that was good 

363.82 369.70 B: oh okay see i you know i hear different you know uh different things about that 

369.12 371.19 A: uh there there's a lot of uh 

371.65 386.02 A: [lipsmack] i guess a lot of lot of underlying themes in the movie that you don't really understand like i i had to watch the uh the matrix i had to watch the the the first one about three times to totally understand what was going on but 

385.40 386.32 B: right 

386.65 388.20 B: well that's a good thing though 

386.65 387.65 A: but uh 

388.11 390.34 A: oh yeah seems like 

389.58 393.43 B: yeah that's that's that's one thing that women can't fucking understand 

392.78 394.58 A: [laughter] 

393.92 399.67 B: you know i- if anything if you watch have something a second time you know women are just fucking dufuses 

399.22 404.58 A: yes [laughter] yeah well we could uh we could talk another ten minutes about that too 

403.84 405.91 B: (( [laughter] yeah right yeah )) 

405.54 406.68 A: but uh 

406.95 412.13 A: and as far as uh the movie thing goes it's like [lipsmack] um 

412.36 418.33 A: you know it seems like the summer's a better time to go out and see movies x. men the matrix 

418.32 428.13 A: uh all these all these i guess blockbusters come out in the uh in the summertime seems like the winter is kind of a kind of a dead period for movies 

427.65 429.62 B: yeah well [laughter] you know [laughter] 

431.23 432.21 A: but uh 

431.25 434.62 B: i don't really pay that much attention to tell you the truth 

435.01 436.42 A: oh well 

435.82 443.03 B: uh you know i missed you know yesterday was on affirmation action and oh my god i missed that one oh f- i was ready to 

443.27 447.87 B: i could have gone off you know for if i could have talked all day [laughter] 

447.34 449.09 A: (( [laughter] )) 

448.46 451.90 B: but i missed it yesterday i don't what happened you know 

451.72 453.09 A: (( uh i see )) 

451.91 455.43 B: i guess i had to wait too long for you know somebody to hook up with me 

455.48 459.36 B: because i am so against affirmative action oh 

458.97 463.30 A: oh yeah yeah that's definitely uh that's definitely a hot issue i 

462.58 473.28 B: oh and i am so angry you know and you know i have to sit there and listen to my my parents tell me about oh it's cool it's great and everything and i'm well no it's not [laughter] 

472.39 478.53 A: not necessarily i think it's more based on uh merit than anything it's about what y- 

477.65 480.21 B: of course and that's the way it should be 

479.77 481.65 A: yeah but you know 

481.02 489.41 B: uh you know what you know and you know i'm a real sports fan or whatever and i sit there and i have to watch a basketball game and every guy is black 

485.00 485.80 A: (( mhm )) 

489.35 497.06 B: you know you don't have to put some you know some white guy in there just because you know to make a white guy's in there this is it's stupid 

495.27 496.19 A: [laughter] 

496.79 498.45 A: [laughter] 

497.66 508.69 B: and that's just like you know and just like you know if i'm i'm i'm if i'm dying in a bur- a a burning building you know and some little white girl is has to drag me out of there which she can't do because she's an idiot 

508.30 509.66 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

508.61 516.32 B: but you know that's the way it is you know i want some big white guy or some big black guy dragging me out of there not some little white girl 

515.77 517.22 A: [laughter] 

516.55 526.00 B: it's stupid everything is stupid this whole world is frigging stupid but anyway anyway yeah um what's your favorite movie of all time
