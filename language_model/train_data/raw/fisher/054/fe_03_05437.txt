53.96 56.03 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

55.42 57.71 B: but are are you you're up in houston 

57.64 59.34 A: yeah 

58.37 59.31 B: okay 

59.95 62.08 A: well so what do you think about affirmative action 

60.17 61.75 B: (( all right well )) 

61.78 68.93 B: affirmative action well it's kind of a wide these statements are so they're so general you can't 

68.60 70.24 A: yeah 

69.39 75.16 B: uh you know uh 'cause you can always say well depends on this and this and this and all the you know the all these 

75.32 89.41 B: qualifications to be made but uh what do i think i think it definitely in certain situations i think we're not to the point i think we're a- at a point now where things and situations have gotten much better for minorities but 

89.25 90.82 A: i would agree with that 

90.04 94.64 B: i think it adds diversity i think diversity's a good thing in the workplace and in different places 

95.39 96.56 B: that's my view 

96.59 103.30 A: yeah yeah i mean i can definitely see that um not being a minority myself i i mean i really 

99.60 100.44 B: uh-huh 

103.65 104.43 A: (( you know )) 

104.48 106.81 A: (( it it doesn't affect me [laughter] you know )) 

106.91 115.06 A: i've been a manager and a supervisor for quite a while but it was never a topic you know we never had to 

115.46 116.34 A: (( you know )) 

116.67 118.38 B: right 

117.99 119.83 A: g- go through all that so 

119.18 131.85 B: right right i think as a min- if i as a minority i i would kind of look down upon it because it you know it kinda it's it's saying that i'm inferior that i i'm so inferior 

120.86 121.90 A: i don't know 

132.22 138.13 B: that i need some- something to lift me up above you other than my own self qualifications 

135.45 136.46 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

138.24 139.33 A: right 

138.69 145.82 B: so i think in in a as a minority maybe i wouldn't like it i would think that i could take care of my own business without somebody giving me extra points 

146.38 147.33 B: whatever 

146.42 152.33 A: well i know government agencies i mean jeeze if you if you're anything but a minority you you can't you can't get in 

153.03 154.87 B: right 

153.70 154.75 A: [noise] you know 

154.81 158.11 A: that's just just the luck of the draw 

158.50 160.22 B: right 

160.22 162.54 A: [noise] [noise] which i don't i mean i don't think that's right 

163.52 175.80 B: yeah yeah i do- i it's economic it's the economics side good or very positive economic side to it too because i guess the more money you get into the hands of minorities the better of they are 

165.13 166.47 A: (( i mean i have a lot of friends )) 

175.51 176.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

176.33 179.75 B: yeah and there's i- it so that's probably a good thing though too 

180.52 183.07 A: i know a lot of my friends have tried to 

183.50 190.15 A: get in the f._b._i. or the c._i._a. or any of that and if you're a white male sheet you can forget it 

187.90 189.43 B: yeah i've heard of that 

190.32 192.07 B: yeah 

191.57 193.71 A: [noise] they want females or m- 

193.85 196.78 A: or uh males of a different race 

196.79 199.10 B: yeah i've heard about 

197.17 200.13 A: and that to me is just god that's wrong 

199.93 201.77 B: yeah 

200.75 205.60 A: so in that aspect yeah it's it's bad um 

204.17 205.01 B: uh-huh 

207.15 208.89 A: [noise] you know of course i don't 

209.14 213.62 A: [mn] on the other i don't know [noise] what the ratio is you know 

213.70 215.08 B: right i don't either

215.16 215.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

216.11 217.03 B: uh-huh

246.66 248.32 B: yeah 

247.17 250.33 A: i had that one too and that i i thought it was kinda silly but

302.22 305.10 B: right right hm mhm 

304.17 307.04 A: [noise] [noise] many years ago 

305.77 306.56 B: (( uh )) 

307.80 313.34 B: oh we're not getting off topic there might not get that ten bucks [laughter] [laughter] i'm kidding 

309.55 310.36 A: [noise] 

310.77 316.31 A: oh yeah uh [noise] so affirmative action hey i think it was good back in the sixties 

314.52 315.08 B: (( [mn] )) 

316.59 317.51 B: yeah 

316.69 318.95 A: and seventies and uh 

319.25 329.02 A: i have talked to a [noise] to some of my minority friends about it and most most of my female friends they still like it 

328.91 330.78 B: right 

329.82 334.39 A: and then but then some of the minority males they they don't care too much for it 

334.27 335.90 B: huh interesting 

335.33 336.31 A: so 

336.77 340.08 A: [noise] i don't know but that's only a small sampling you know 

339.59 344.06 B: right i r- huh i haven't really d- don't come into cont- i'm a teacher 

344.15 345.38 A: oh yeah 

344.39 354.78 B: so right so now there's not really a need for affirmative action in teaching [laughter] although there probably needs to be more black teachers and you know i think that would be good and since it's 

349.05 349.89 A: yeah 

355.12 366.93 B: we have to deal with minority students and i think it's good for them to see people of their you know like themselves in in in in a teaching position i think that gives them a positive picture of themselves 

363.53 364.27 A: (( oh yeah )) 

367.30 368.17 B: (( so )) 

368.31 377.81 B: now i think about it when you really start it's interesting to really talk about it when you start talking about it you really think more deeply about it you realize things you don't realize that's interesting 

368.52 369.55 A: yeah 

369.65 371.01 A: i would agree with that 

375.08 375.90 A: yeah 

377.83 379.30 A: what grade do you teach 

379.06 381.26 B: i teach ninth grade geography

387.10 387.95 B: (( mhm )) 

388.37 390.34 A: yeah i hear that that like uh 

388.45 390.22 B: yeah 

390.61 395.10 A: junior high is like the hardest level to to teach 

395.89 399.32 A: they're just like like going through their puberty and stuff 

396.07 397.91 B: oh gosh yeah i wo- 

399.14 402.38 B: i would not want to teach that [laughter] ninth grade's bad enough 

403.51 405.42 B: yeah 

404.48 410.45 A: [laughter] kids now would you say predominantly uh the kids at your school are minority or is it a nice mix 

408.93 420.60 B: uh not at [mn] sterling at at baytown lee there's a lot there's a a large hispanic group of students there most of them uh oh a few black students about every class we have 

420.54 427.63 B: you know a couple but uh some of them you know they're really difficult to deal with some of those minority students 

422.15 422.97 A: uh-huh 

427.81 428.98 A: yeah 

428.39 433.15 B: uh they can be i guess you know that from being from stratford i guess there's 

433.97 437.98 B: i guess uh in that area there's a lot of some mi- i don't know i'm not familiar with that area 

437.24 441.22 A: well when i went to school there we had like two black people in the whole 

440.90 442.47 B: oh my gosh 

442.02 445.45 A: yeah it was it was uh yeah 

445.70 447.98 A: it wasn't like it is probably now 

447.78 451.92 B: yeah yeah where i went to school has really changed too there are more minorities 

452.29 453.94 B: uh there too 

454.00 461.70 A: it was quite a shock too when i was left high school and went right into the army and basic training you know shoot there was like four white guys 

461.80 465.27 B: yeah you're the you're the minority all of a sudden 

462.74 464.65 A: [lipsmack] and the rest of them were 

465.06 467.53 A: yeah black and hispanic 

465.66 466.62 B: uh-huh 

467.69 469.24 A: it was crazy 

469.11 470.56 B: [laughter] 

469.30 471.06 A: i mean it was a great experience 

470.78 472.71 B: right 

471.55 473.08 A: but i just you know 

473.45 475.85 A: i still called black people colored people 

476.13 478.74 A: and boy they gave me shit about that off the bat 

478.75 479.71 B: oo 

479.73 482.33 A: yeah it wasn't good [laughter] 

481.66 482.79 B: wow 

482.62 485.09 A: what color am i they used to say 

484.85 486.57 B: r- really how old are you 

486.86 488.52 A: i'm thirty five thirty six 

488.38 490.70 B: okay i'm thirty three 

490.76 491.70 B: (( [laughter] )) 

492.53 494.18 B: but huh 

494.50 496.38 A: i don't know i i i think it's 

498.61 503.03 A: you know the [sigh] the government's so black and white it's either we do it 

503.11 505.64 A: and we do it for everything or we don't do it at all 

505.77 507.64 B: yeah 

507.13 511.34 A: so maybe that's why they gave us the topic so broad out um 

510.40 512.08 B: yeah 

511.93 515.77 A: i i think we should do away with it but you know i don't know 

515.84 517.42 B: yeah well 

516.40 517.93 A: that's just my vote 

517.79 520.51 B: well yeah it's so complex 

520.55 521.75 A: yeah 

520.76 522.10 B: (( ye- i don't know )) 

522.05 529.05 A: i mean it's it's easy to say one way or the other but you could probably come up with a million examples to go either way 

528.79 540.61 B: ri- yeah i think like you say you have bla- i think if i were a minority i would think i would thi- i would take it as an insult i wouldn't i would look at it like man i don't need help i can take care of myself i'm s- i'm s- that it really is an insult in a way 

540.64 543.24 B: that's how i would look at it 

540.84 541.64 A: well 

542.14 545.84 A: this this country was based on freedom of choice 

546.57 548.73 A: and now the government's dictating 

549.03 555.25 A: how many people of different you know are are they going to start making us 

555.64 557.41 A: hire homosexuals too 

558.62 559.57 A: i mean 

558.91 559.80 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

559.73 566.73 A: you know it's just to me it's just you know if i ran my own business by god if someone tried to tell me who i should hire 

567.66 570.75 A: my comp- company it's my business i want i want the best person 

567.87 569.53 B: yeah 

572.70 574.42 B: right 

572.88 575.63 A: so if i look at it from that aspect 

575.95 577.16 A: i get a little 

578.10 580.13 A: you know i would definitely string it 

581.15 583.90 A: till they absolutely get rid of it 

582.96 584.73 B: right 

584.47 589.90 A: but then i start thinking if if i was a minority and i'm out there trying to find a job and 

589.57 596.35 B: right and and the only people hiring like you say the only people hiring i know are are are white people 

590.03 592.63 A: you know there's still the old boys' network out there 

596.37 597.37 A: (( mhm )) 

596.74 599.89 B: i mean they're gonna be more you're more likely to hire your own than you are people
