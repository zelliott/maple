158.36 160.49 B: it's it does keep you busy 

160.04 169.24 A: i gu- i guess it would so how would you rank your hobbies as far as um which ones you have the most time for or which ones you enjoy the most 

168.63 176.36 B: well probably what i enjoy the most would be fishing yeah i i enjoy just uh the relaxation of it you know 

172.19 173.20 A: uh-huh 

175.55 177.40 A: mhm 

176.78 184.87 B: i enjoy uh just going out in a boat or just even being on the shore and just relaxing i like to be outdoors you know 

184.45 188.83 A: uh-huh do you live near a is it convenient for you to do that 

185.06 186.16 B: (( it just )) 

187.72 195.20 B: yeah well i live near a a reservoir that has some good fishing actually there's a couple of 'em uh pretty good sized lakes 

193.12 194.02 A: (( huh )) 

194.69 195.94 A: mhm 

195.34 200.93 B: and then i'm only about an hour away from lake erie also so i go up there every once in a while 

199.33 200.20 A: (( oh )) 

200.67 206.68 A: ca- um uh have i guess they've cleaned that up enough to uh to be able to fish in it now [laughter] 

204.65 219.24 B: yeah it it's made a big difference oh probably ten twelve years ago you know i wouldn't even think of fishing in there it's it w- it was a real mess you know there was a lot of garbage and i mean it just uh even the water had a funny smell to it 

211.43 212.25 A: [laughter] 

212.49 213.49 A: uh-huh 

214.96 216.80 A: (( right )) 

218.57 220.88 A: (( mm mhm )) 

219.57 228.49 B: but over the last i don't know eight or ten years they've really uh done a great job of cleaning that lake up you you wouldn't uh you don't see garbage around anymore and it 

224.30 225.14 A: (( huh )) 

227.87 228.93 A: uh-huh 

228.70 230.90 B: that does make a difference on the fishing 

230.88 234.44 A: yeah i g- i guess uh i guess it would 

233.71 235.21 B: (( [sigh] but yeah )) 

235.15 243.43 A: [sigh] yeah wasn't there an issue with uh bar was there some sort of uh the zebra mussels or something is that what they had up there that was kind of starting to clog up the waterways 

242.92 250.60 B: oh yeah there was some- something to do with some type of mussels that um i can't remember the exact details of what was causing it 

245.95 247.21 A: (( uh huh )) 

250.42 259.14 B: but uh they they did a lot to environmentally clean it up it's actually they say it's one of the cleaner uh great lakes there is right now 

257.29 258.61 A: (( hm mhm )) 

258.85 260.82 A: (( uh-huh huh oh great )) 

259.85 265.00 B: uh it's that's nice because you know like i said it's it's beautiful up there 

263.85 264.74 A: uh-huh 

265.16 273.46 B: but i just like being out on the water yeah i'd i'm usually one of those types i don't care if i catch anything or not you know i just the relaxation of it 

267.10 267.94 A: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

270.09 277.72 A: [laughter] uh-huh sounds like my dad he's also uh tha- that's his favorite sport is fishing and uh 

276.89 278.86 B: is that right yeah 

277.83 281.98 A: yeah yeah he and my mom bought a bought a place in uh new jersey on the lake 

282.03 288.39 A: and uh so they you know he goes out uh almost every every day if it's uh it's a nice day 

288.17 290.50 B: yeah i'm 

289.07 293.35 A: [laughter] doesn't usually catch too much but it like you said it's the [cough] 

291.16 302.24 B: yeah that's the same way i am i e- every once in a while i'll catch a nice one and it makes you feel good but then you gotta clean it and uh all that stuff so [laughter] 

295.25 296.54 A: mhm 

298.72 302.21 A: (( [cough] mm mhm [laughter] )) 

302.23 310.66 B: but [laughter] but it is fun i'd like i say that's probably one of my more relaxing things and then uh about two years ago i took up golf 

302.49 304.27 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

306.35 308.02 A: (( yeah )) 

310.28 311.87 A: (( oh uh-huh mhm mhm )) 

310.87 315.69 B: and i don't do that too much i get out maybe three or four times a summer 

315.91 324.19 B: but that's something that i would like to do when i retire you know i'd probably spend a little more time just going out and hitting a golf ball around 

319.98 320.83 A: uh-huh 

322.26 324.67 A: did you take lessons 

324.46 333.10 B: uh yeah well not not professionally but a friend of mine is a fairly good golfer and he kinda you know got me going in it 

333.19 340.54 B: and he's taught me a lot you know he'll he'll tell me what i'm doing wrong and how to correct it and it he's made a big difference 

336.06 339.83 A: (( hm mhm hm )) 

340.60 341.76 A: (( oh uh-huh )) 

340.68 343.73 B: he's he's the one i usually go out golfing with 

343.44 347.67 A: uh-huh okay and do you walk the course or do you have a cart and all that 

344.77 345.59 B: i 

347.00 361.55 B: well i've done both well i actually enjoy i'd rather walk it because a lot of times you know you got somebody in a cart behind you that it's better to be in a cart because then you'll slow them down so it depends on who's around you 

348.37 349.17 A: uh-huh 

351.65 352.62 A: uh-huh 

355.59 356.60 A: (( uh-huh )) 

361.26 362.83 A: (( mm mhm )) 

362.45 364.31 B: but either way it's a lot of fun 

364.05 364.81 A: (( hm uh-huh )) 

364.50 369.81 B: especially on a nice warm day you know if the sun's shining it's you can't beat it 

369.89 372.61 A: right as long as you don't forget your hat or your sunscreen or what 

371.89 373.77 B: right exactly 

372.86 375.74 A: (( right [laughter] yeah uh-huh )) 

374.10 376.90 B: [laughter] what do you grow in that garden of yours 

376.89 384.02 A: uh well we've got got kind of two uh two parts of it there's a little vegetable garden we've got some uh 

384.18 395.07 A: just about the end of the the the pea season now it's a small garden you know but uh the vegetable garden's small anyway every year uh tomatoes are kind of the biggest hit tomatoes and cucumbers 

388.09 389.34 B: yeah 

394.66 399.31 B: that's my favorite the tomatoes i love tomato and bacon sandwiches i 

395.78 396.64 A: uh-huh 

398.75 399.55 A: (( oh )) 

400.18 404.74 B: i i grow them pretty g- nice i uh that's mainly the the only thing i grow in mine 

404.37 405.31 A: uh-huh 

404.90 412.12 B: everything else is uh you know i don't really much care for i usually give most all everything else away that i would try to grow in there 

405.36 406.20 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

410.04 413.38 A: (( hm mhm )) 

412.54 414.92 B: but i love tomatoes [laughter] 

413.92 417.46 A: uh-huh oh tomatoes there's nothing like a fresh tomato right out of the garden 

416.27 418.15 B: oh yeah you can't beat it yeah 

418.05 420.37 A: right [laughter] 

420.72 427.74 A: and uh and then you know flowers we have a perennial garden uh and some different beds of uh you know different uh 

427.94 438.41 A: uh different perennials coming up and uh that's that's that's kind of a a bit of chore to keep that all weeded and [cough] and looking good trimming it yeah 

429.73 431.54 B: (( oh yeah )) 

433.60 437.07 B: (( oh it is yeah )) 

437.30 443.50 B: yeah i know a little bit of landscaping i have around my house you know that's just uh it's hard to keep up with 

442.96 443.72 A: (( mm )) 

443.60 448.37 B: yeah you gotta get all those weeds out of there that's that's a hobby in itself [laughter] 

446.71 449.02 A: (( mhm yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

449.29 456.32 A: yeah it's kind of therapeutic but uh it takes a lot you know it takes there's only so many hours in a day yeah [laughter] 

453.95 455.79 B: yeah 

455.86 462.69 B: yeah it seems like the older i get too the fewer those hours are left you know the time just goes by so fast
