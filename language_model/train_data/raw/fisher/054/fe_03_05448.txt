1.34 5.38 A: (( hi this is dan uh that's about )) 

8.37 12.56 A: (( it hello )) 

9.93 10.98 B: (( [noise] hello )) 

12.27 13.55 B: hey was it dan 

12.90 18.18 A: (( yeah yeah hi mike this is )) 

14.13 15.43 B: hey this is mike 

16.62 24.92 B: odd i just [laughter] uh my mom just kind of handed me the phone and gave me a a brief summary of what was going on uh with the c- 

22.92 33.38 A: oh i i really don't i i don't really know what's going on either but is they uh they said some sort of a topic you know it was it was would you rather 

32.88 35.70 B: as far as watch movies in like a theater 

34.45 47.35 A: yeah would you rather prefer to go see it in a theater than actually go and rent the movie at the home which is which is a kind of a ridiculous question to me 'cause both are they've got their 

45.87 47.43 B: they're apples and oranges 

47.37 55.74 B: [laughter] yeah exactly well there's e- exactly there's there's two different kinds of enjoyments that you would get from that but 

47.41 50.32 A: yeah and it's two separate things 

53.14 55.73 A: (( so right [noise] )) 

55.56 66.98 B: i mean and at least i mean when you get to go the theater you know you feel like it's more of a production you're catered to a little bit more and when you're at home you're able to kind of manipulate what you're watching and and kind of take things at your own pace 

66.90 80.12 A: right or you could fast forward through you know credits and crap and but yeah you know you can sit there with whoever you want to and and burp and fart and pick your nose and you know all that it's a little bit easier ah chicago 

71.35 72.98 B: (( yeah )) 

75.51 77.13 B: [laughter]

118.23 123.64 B: yeah did you see did you see uh spiderman the last one the like the marvel thing they did

123.73 127.76 A: the uh the original the movie spiderman 

127.15 129.39 B: yeah yeah the one the one that came out a couple of years ago 

129.18 130.67 A: yeah that was great 

130.23 143.05 B: yeah see that was one was good that one was like imaginative or whatever and the special effects were good and they did a lot to like you know make uh spiderman look like the comics or whatever like as far as they they put a lot into like the special effects to his special abilities or whatever 

142.82 145.27 B: but with the hulk it was just like i don't know 

146.02 157.15 B: oh i guess there there was just nothing special like the the computer effects on that that uh hulk or whatever it looked so so and i don't know yeah what about what about the last what about the last movie you saw 

152.78 166.18 A: oh really yeah didn't put a lot of thought into it uh i i work with kids so i i saw this finding nemo like twice so [laughter] yeah uh that's a great movie 

161.95 162.87 B: (( oh did uh )) 

162.89 171.31 B: [laughter] see you see that that was a great movie i i thought so too like uh i thought the special effects were good on it and like uh 

171.17 185.13 B: i thought like all the characters you know they had like really good personalities or whatever and things like that but uh it it just seemed to me like uh like it was another one of those uh uh pixar uh films or whatever it was a very like a cut paste kind of what they've been doing recently you know 

174.70 175.37 A: (( mhm )) 

177.51 188.86 A: (( yeah )) 

185.07 195.38 B: they give they give they give all the animals or whatever and all the creatures kind of like a personality which is a c- celebrity or whatever and then then they completely they they draw 'em to relate to situations with their own life 

190.78 192.13 A: (( w- right )) 

192.61 200.24 A: well that's true w- w- what if they didn't i mean [laughter] what if they didn't do that i 

197.14 200.90 B: what's that yeah well then i guess it then i guess it wouldn't be terribly interesting would it 

200.64 213.74 A: mean no i mean if they're like normal fish that are just chilling [laughter] are well i mean i guess it's what they did with the uh did you see that that shark take it's before the movie with the snowman and a 

203.08 207.47 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] i guess that would be pretty sad [laughter] 

213.62 216.48 B: yeah see that was actually pretty cool i liked that 

215.87 226.04 A: that was cool and y- you kind of wonder that you never well all all you have to do with you're just seeing something like that 

220.78 221.79 B: it re- it re- 

221.91 236.11 B: it reminds of what they used to do before some of the car- like uh i went to see roger rabbit when i was real little and they did like a little skit or whatever like a cartoon before the movie kind of thing there's uh i don't know it it was always like something extra for the movie and that was actually kind of cool 

231.29 232.14 A: (( mhm )) 

235.87 240.69 A: right yeah uh roger rabbit was was good stuff
