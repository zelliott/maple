9.72 10.81 B: (( how you doing )) 

10.64 12.23 A: i'm doing good 

12.25 17.45 B: so [sigh] uh initial opinion would you do it [lipsmack] 

17.28 18.25 A: no 

18.55 20.20 B: i don't think i would either 

20.31 23.53 B: i think that would sort of undermine my entire concept of friendship 

24.31 25.72 B: um plus 

24.68 26.06 A: yeah 

25.74 33.37 B: i don't i don't know [sigh] do you think it's uh it's an issue of the money period or if maybe the stakes were raised a little bit do you think you'd go for it 

32.75 34.75 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] i don't think so 

34.60 35.68 B: really 

35.60 36.55 A: (( [noise] no )) 

38.33 43.35 B: y- yeah i don't know a million dollars isn't as much as it used to be [laughter] 

39.30 40.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

42.44 44.30 A: (( [laughter] it's not much )) 

44.35 44.98 B: (( [noise] )) 

44.66 47.90 A: no my my friend means too much to me anyway no amount 

47.77 60.49 B: is that someone you've known for a long time yeah see i don't know i i mean i'm fairly young but i st- i still think there's been a pretty vast progression of best friends i moved around a lot so 

48.05 51.27 A: worth that yeah 

60.57 62.59 B: i don't know i mean 

62.13 63.88 A: [laughter] 

63.18 69.32 B: i tend to be pretty good friends with people i'm in relationships with and that would be a whole different can of worms i feel [lipsmack] 

68.64 72.45 A: yeah well i've known him since 

70.35 71.55 B: (( i don't know just )) 

73.13 75.51 A: about ninety five probably 

75.43 76.62 B: yeah 

76.06 78.08 A: (( no longer than that )) 

77.65 78.53 B: really 

78.32 79.96 A: yeah 

78.83 81.74 B: what's you guys background how'd you meet 

80.93 81.88 A: um 

82.02 83.97 A: oh just at school high school 

83.98 90.09 B: oh yeah oh yeah i think friendships that started out late have probably a lot of potential for being enduring 

84.88 85.74 A: yeah 

89.83 91.25 A: yeah 

90.97 94.63 B: yeah i uh i ended up um going to college with 

94.51 107.23 B: s- someone i referred to as my best friend who i met in high school for a long time but i know but you st- like i'm saying since then you know we've been in different areas and i have you know [mn] a lot of other people i'm probably closer to right now so 

98.25 99.63 A: right 

106.73 107.57 A: really 

107.59 108.54 B: (( oh no )) 

107.65 112.81 A: yeah he and i went through high school together then we went through college together in the same program 

112.79 113.58 B: (( mm )) 

113.49 116.06 A: and we still do a lot of stuff together so 

116.71 121.32 B: that's awesome did you uh have you just stayed in the same area pretty much 

121.09 122.44 A: what's that 

121.83 124.13 B: have you stayed in the same area pretty much 

123.74 125.14 A: yeah pretty much 

125.63 129.89 B: yeah see i moved around a time like i said and i don't know it just uh [lipsmack] 

130.99 137.75 B: it seems like i e- especially before you settle into careers it's it's hard to keep contact 

136.86 138.67 A: right 

137.87 138.85 B: (( i don't know )) 

139.07 139.63 A: (( [mn] )) 

140.05 141.60 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

141.80 144.13 B: that's cool where are you calling from 

143.52 144.68 A: uh utah 

144.92 145.78 B: (( oh really )) 

145.88 146.97 A: yeah 

146.41 149.72 B: uh do you go to school around there and everything and 

148.69 150.07 A: yeah i did 

150.19 151.13 B: right on 

151.00 152.27 A: around salt lake 

152.50 155.95 B: yeah i'm in new york right now i uh 

155.10 155.98 A: cool 

155.94 168.48 B: i went to high school in texas though and you know i actually i only speak to about three or four people from high school are there they're all like really close friends but [sigh] as far as which one of them i'd sell out for a million dollars um 

157.89 158.94 A: really 

168.32 171.66 B: probably nathan i i haven't seen him in three years so 

168.48 169.62 A: [laughter] 

171.88 174.40 B: i think he'd be glad to hear about it 

173.78 175.39 A: [laughter] 

174.44 183.26 B: 'cause they just said speaking so specifically you know i mean like i wouldn't mind you know if i haven't seen the guy in three years maybe write him a check 

183.30 185.68 B: and uh 'cause we don't talk anyway 

185.56 186.82 A: right 

185.69 188.36 B: so give him a small stipend 

187.78 189.17 A: [laughter] 

188.69 189.86 B: you know 

189.59 190.84 A: yeah 

190.32 199.84 B: so so i think it it might be a matter of just having a lower tier best friend you know i mean i i remember when i was in school early on like third fourth grade 

195.27 196.75 A: [laughter] 

199.68 205.87 B: it maybe oh that's way too late i don't know first or second grade people would tell you you're their best friend and a day's time you know 

205.71 206.78 A: right 

205.94 208.00 B: you'd actually have a best friend for a day 

207.82 209.03 A: yeah 

208.62 216.57 B: um but i guess so i guess friendships start to me more as you get older this phone call really eli- elicits a lot of wishy washy philosophy from me 

212.82 213.96 A: (( mm true )) 

216.55 218.82 A: [laughter] 

217.13 220.56 B: it's just the nature of the study how'd you find out about the study 

220.03 221.56 A: um my wife 

221.43 222.42 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

223.00 223.96 B: right on 

223.10 224.88 A: she signed me up for it 

224.53 227.54 B: [laughter] she tell you about it 

226.33 228.92 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

228.03 229.99 B: would you sell her out for a million dollars 

230.05 231.02 A: no 

230.75 242.12 B: no no yeah that's that's not a good idea i wouldn't sell my girlfriend out for it um a couple of ex girlfriends i probably would now sell out for it um maybe then too i don't know 

231.49 232.33 A: (( [laughter] )) 

243.81 245.33 B: (( wow as )) 

246.25 247.72 A: (( so yeah )) 

246.69 250.55 B: far as the do you think a lot of do you think a lot of people would would do it 

250.22 252.57 A: [cough] i don't know i don't think so 

254.49 258.70 A: i i really don't think we would but you know that's my perspective on life i 

259.15 260.79 A: have a lot of um [lipsmack] 

259.22 260.42 B: yeah 

260.99 263.39 A: just uh hope in people really 

264.30 271.57 B: yeah and you know the scary thing is you could you know i don't know what what line of work you're in i'm not really 

271.62 276.33 B: involved but the way money travels in this world you'd think you could pretty easily 

276.36 282.80 B: mm you know or at least you have a decent chance of finding yourself in the situation where you could sell out your best friend for a million dollars 

282.83 293.44 B: so it ends up being a lot less hypothetical if you're someone who plays around with money a lot i mean i know i don't know i've been reading a lot a- i've been reading a lot about just lately it's 

289.35 290.57 A: that's true 

293.93 308.66 B: a couple of my friends are in and i don't know it seems like routinely there's a lot of people who get managed by their friends and quite literally ended up being taken for a million dollars and more because of them doesn't always result in life long silent treatment but i don't know i mean 

308.17 309.42 A: yeah 

309.05 310.10 B: [sigh] 

310.54 311.90 A: interesting concept 

312.97 315.59 A: when you put it a different way like that 

315.67 320.27 A: [mn] but [lipsmack] i'm not really in a career job yet so 

315.99 316.87 B: yeah 

320.59 323.45 B: yeah have you been out of school for a while 

323.26 325.30 A: um about a year 

325.43 326.83 B: yeah 

326.49 331.33 A: and i i only have i've got an associate degrees but i don't have a bachelors so 

331.16 332.43 B: yeah 

331.87 335.69 A: and the industry's kind of soft anyway in my field so 

333.97 334.84 B: right 

335.51 337.01 B: what are you looking to get into 

336.93 338.10 A: animation 

338.12 339.72 B: that's cool 

339.07 344.08 A: yeah so i mean there's a lot of it out there but it's just really competitive 

340.42 341.62 B: yeah 

343.83 345.62 B: yeah 

345.69 352.60 B: well i think animators at least try to stick together [laughter] if if they make millions they do it as a team right 

348.44 349.93 A: oh definitely 

351.89 352.95 A: (( right [noise] )) 

353.27 355.14 B: uh that's what's good about it 

355.15 357.07 B: yeah 

357.51 360.21 A: yeah unless they have some kind of falling out 

359.99 362.11 B: right [laughter] 

360.49 364.04 A: (( but um [laughter] [mn] )) 

363.67 368.27 B: wow well you know but that that that's a career where you quite uh 

368.38 372.29 B: possibly could make the big money if you stuck with it 

371.36 373.49 A: yeah that's what i'm hoping for 

374.32 379.46 A: it's it's getting pretty big you know lot more movies coming out that have animation a lot of 

379.56 380.67 B: yeah oh yeah 

379.56 385.02 A: special effects and t._v. shows so i mean there's just more and more of it 

384.82 392.82 B: i heard one of the biggest uh ones this summer was the finding nemo animated one you know did better than a lot of uh star vehicles 

389.11 390.87 A: yeah 

392.83 394.16 A: right 

393.52 395.35 B: (( yeah i don't know [lipsmack] )) 

395.59 400.66 B: hopefully that'll just lead to better acting but [laughter] and uh also success 

398.28 399.50 A: [laughter] 

401.11 407.87 B: [mn] wow yeah uh any particular animated stuff that you admire 

408.25 409.32 A: um 

409.78 413.46 A: i haven't really diversed uh i like a whole range of things 

413.61 415.77 A: uh i'm really big into disney 

415.77 416.70 B: uh-huh 

416.37 419.50 A: i've got like everything they've ever put out 

419.02 420.80 B: yeah 

420.36 422.90 A: and i just i it's incredible stuff 

423.21 425.59 B: what do you think of their progression you think they've 

425.78 429.08 B: i mean i know a lot of people prefer the older stuff 

429.04 434.26 A: yeah i i think quality wise like the animation i mean they're just getting 

434.54 438.65 A: like technology they've always been ahead of the pack and i think they still are 

438.39 439.53 B: yeah 

438.93 445.05 A: but just i i don't i don't know about those who are running the company right now 

444.83 446.75 B: yeah 

445.60 450.95 A: they just closed down the traditional animation compart of the company so 

450.49 451.54 B: (( type stuff )) 

451.77 456.54 A: uh celluloid type stuff yeah they they they don't they're not even gonna do that any more 

451.92 452.63 B: or 

453.56 454.61 B: yeah 

456.68 460.17 B: really i'm surprised they won't even keep it around for history's sake but 

459.35 460.47 A: so 

460.51 461.46 A: i mean 

462.18 464.90 A: [cough] i can it's not making as much money right now but 

464.53 466.51 B: [laughter] like they need it [noise] 

465.52 471.54 A: it's it's it's not the first time that that's happened with the company you know disney's been in the red a lot 

471.44 472.95 B: yeah 

472.13 475.73 A: you know people don't realize that but they really have been 

474.59 481.67 B: yeah and they they seem to me to be you know cash cow but every company has their problems 

481.10 483.34 A: yeah so 

483.45 484.57 B: but 

483.88 484.85 A: (( i don't know )) 

486.51 488.58 B: right on well where'd you work

489.48 491.38 B: (( yeah well )) 

490.42 494.02 A: that'd be pretty cool but i don't know much about business so 

494.36 506.32 B: yeah man i'm in the same boat i'm a musician and like i said i've been reading up on the music business and just trying to get my bearings because you can have a whole career of you know constantly getting stepped on if you don't know that stuff 

506.10 507.37 A: yeah that's true 

507.48 509.14 B: yeah
