30.24 33.22 B: yeah what was the last movie you saw 

33.73 43.28 A: um the last movie i saw was um uh but i didn't see all of it um ten ways to lose a guy or how to lose a guy in ten days 

42.91 44.31 B: oh yeah uh-huh 

43.74 49.17 A: um because i was flying back from uh a business trip and it was showing on the plane 

48.88 50.41 B: okay yeah 

50.42 59.65 A: so so it was kind of interesting 'cause it's not necessarily a movie you'd pick right see like planes you kinda watch 'em because they're there 

52.84 53.83 B: (( mhm )) 

55.08 56.28 B: mhm mhm 

59.23 60.59 B: yeah 

60.27 64.32 A: so you see movies you wouldn't necessarily go to and i kinda like that 

62.57 68.85 B: yeah yeah mhm well would you prefer to go the movie theater or rent oh that's the 

67.68 74.23 A: um it really depends um i think i prefer to rent stuff and watch movies at home 

73.74 75.02 B: (( mhm )) 

74.38 75.39 A: um 

75.78 81.63 A: overall um but there's obviously certain types of movies that are better to go see in a theater 

76.81 78.05 B: yeah 

81.38 82.45 B: okay 

82.35 83.39 A: (( um )) 

82.47 88.95 B: yeah like uh some of the action movies are pretty good uh in in the in a theater right so 

88.20 90.20 A: yeah obviously they 

89.11 100.98 B: you get all the sounds and you get all the fla- uh uh active uh the the big um big screen e- uh experience kinda thing instead of uh like a home or with uh 

100.90 105.99 B: with the television or or a surround sound at a- at most right 

105.53 106.73 A: yeah 

106.18 108.08 B: yeah so 

108.12 113.56 B: uh yeah last time i sa- i saw like um a- anger management right and it 

113.89 120.32 B: it's a pretty good movie i like if uh i think it's like a family like uh 

120.48 126.23 B: a relationship based kind of movie it's kind kinda pretty good 

123.55 124.55 A: right 

126.10 127.08 A: cool 

126.72 129.11 B: yeah [noise] mhm 

129.01 142.00 A: um yeah i totally feel the same way i mean um i think one of the big things about going to the theater versus watching it at home for me is if i think there's going to be added energy from seeing it with a lot of people around 

139.44 140.61 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

141.42 142.58 B: yeah yeah 

141.93 146.03 A: it's nice but i actually prefer going to the theater when it's empty 

145.67 147.55 B: oh uh-huh 

146.81 149.92 A: i love empty movie theaters 

149.33 150.61 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

149.93 150.75 A: (( i if )) 

150.84 155.77 A: there's only like you know five or six people there and it's uh you know first show on a monday 

153.30 154.19 B: uh-huh 

155.44 156.71 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

156.00 170.50 A: yeah um i i don't know why i think um i worked in a movie theater when i was in high school um a couple of the summers and we got free movies and the only time that i wasn't working was the first shows like on mondays and tuesdays 

156.79 157.87 B: oh yeah 

160.95 161.90 B: (( mhm )) 

161.98 162.90 B: yeah 

165.00 165.95 B: (( mhm )) 

169.99 171.29 B: mhm 

170.66 174.16 A: and so i think i got used to going and seeing those 

173.79 178.48 B: oh that uh with less people less crowd right yeah [mn] 

176.91 182.13 A: yeah it it's interesting 'cause it gives you you feel like you're wa- like you've rented it 

181.62 182.94 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

182.70 185.44 A: right like it's just yours um mm 

183.20 184.06 B: yeah 

184.61 185.93 B: (( mhm )) 

186.09 193.14 B: yeah it's uh i i like the atmosphere of the the the theater right uh 

193.40 201.57 B: if it's le- less crowd that's be that'd be perfect right but like uh all the all uh all uh blockbuster movies like 

201.63 206.32 B: [mn] almost uh it's packed almost all the time right so 

206.39 207.09 B: it's 

208.08 208.92 B: it's 

208.29 212.37 A: which do you prefer for watching with friends like if you're going to 

211.98 213.15 B: uh friends 

212.50 216.62 A: see movies with friends yeah do you prefer to watch at home or go out and [noise] 

215.88 222.11 B: uh i prefer the movie theater because it's like uh i- it's actual the experience that counts 

222.19 230.81 B: it's like people uh going out and stuff like that but it's if uh it's like a quiet movie or something i'll i'll rent it at home but 

231.65 233.33 B: when when friends 

233.17 247.54 B: go uh go to the movies or or like uh prefer a mov- a movie they prefer something new and uh when they're like not out out out in on uh videos or or d._v._d.s yet right 

246.82 248.17 A: right 

247.49 248.36 B: so 

248.75 249.51 B: uh 

249.57 253.96 B: i prefer go- going to the movie theater but uh one one drawback is 

254.06 258.51 B: a little bit expensive when you se- yeah [laughter] when you set out to the 

256.97 257.90 A: right 

258.52 261.39 B: the movies right you spend a- at least like uh 

261.54 266.06 B: like mm uh at least it's like twenty bucks uh a person right 

265.81 268.93 A: yeah sometimes [noise] it's kinda crazy 

268.71 279.08 B: yeah it's like uh do you like uh do you plan to go the movies or or or do you just go go when when you have like 

277.80 285.75 A: no i don't like even when i know there's big blockbusters coming out whether i'll see it at the theater or [noise] not is kind of almost up to chance 

282.01 283.57 B: mhm 

285.62 286.78 B: mhm 

286.16 298.93 A: um a lot of i used to be really aggressive like i needed to see the new thing like the first weekend it came out and now if i miss it and i catch it when it comes round on video or cable that's fine i've got enough of 

291.86 292.60 B: mhm 

293.25 294.15 B: yeah 

299.02 304.78 A: other things and other movies to see that no one movie is going to make the difference any more 

301.43 302.44 B: mhm 

304.33 314.02 B: oh i see uh-huh yeah with uh the uh big i i agree with you tha- uh on that with uh like the the new movies coming out 

314.18 324.92 B: like the long the lineups and stuff like that it's like you spend like uh forty five minutes to an hour just uh to line up to get into the theater right and 

323.47 326.22 A: right just so you can be the first to see it i 

327.21 328.39 A: kinda silly 

328.27 331.31 B: that's right [laughter] you can go ahead 

330.78 336.98 A: [noise] oh no i was just saying i agree with you it's you know you spend all that time just so you can be the first to see it 

333.60 335.47 B: yeah yeah 

336.09 343.44 B: yeah yeah it's like uh standing there like for an hour waiting for to get into a me- mo- uh like the movie theater right

526.51 527.62 B: mhm mhm 

530.63 538.46 A: and i tend to find things that i've seen before where i know i can watch just a little bit of it and still understand what's going on

553.36 554.47 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

553.79 568.36 A: um because we lived really close like two blocks away from a pretty good um video store um and now it's not like the one that we're close to isn't within walking distance but it's a few extra blocks and it's not a direction that i'm normally going 

557.48 558.67 B: mhm

578.19 592.28 B: [mn] the neighborhood uh rental store is this like almost uh like extinct already [laughter] and and al- uh and it uh the big the big uh like the blockbusters or or some other uh
