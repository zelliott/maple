237.89 246.12 A: [sigh] i think it just depends on i think it depends a lot on the teacher [sigh] um [mn] 'cause i know that that we have friends who 

241.53 242.58 B: yeah 

246.32 260.90 A: our friends are teachers in pennsylvania [sigh] and i know the budget for the school is that she's teaching at is is really low and she ends up spending some of her own money [sigh] to buy like supplies and stuff for the classroom whi- which i think's crazy [sigh] 

259.60 263.29 B: oh yeah [sigh] i've heard teachers do that sometimes 

260.76 261.76 A: um 

262.41 266.20 A: yeah um which i think's a real shame

271.87 272.70 B: okay 

273.18 279.60 B: [sigh] 'cause i know our g- governor rendell you know t- the teachers are mad at him especially the ones in philly 'cause 

277.56 278.37 A: (( uh-hum )) 

279.67 283.02 B: [sigh] you know they messed up he messed up the school system there 

282.36 284.12 A: right 

283.10 284.12 B: (( [sigh] so [lipsmack] )) 

284.14 284.70 B: (( [sigh] ))

291.93 293.43 A: yeah that's a shame 

292.45 298.39 B: he's doing a lot of cuts yeah but that's life you know [laughter] economics [mn] 

294.28 295.07 A: (( uh-hum )) 

296.88 297.82 A: yeah 

298.20 299.87 A: but i think like [sigh] 

300.42 309.58 A: i don't know maybe the way to resolve it is is money i mean sometimes y- you you can't just throw money at a problem to fix it but i- in this case i think [sigh] u- um 

303.37 304.27 B: yeah 

309.96 318.64 A: it is it it's money like k- kids need [sigh] need supplies and they need [sigh] good teachers especially in in the cities 

316.64 317.57 B: oh yeah 

318.63 323.30 B: yeah [sigh] yeah but [mn] you know money can't fix everything 

319.04 319.85 A: (( [noise] um )) 

322.72 324.20 A: yeah 

323.92 324.83 B: so 

324.98 326.06 A: um 

326.73 328.81 B: [mn] yeah i mean the teachers need to be

331.60 333.00 A: yeah 

332.67 333.61 B: (( and ah )) 

333.98 343.17 B: i think there are more bad teachers now but there are s- it's g- getting a lot [noise] the teaching profession's [noise] becoming more noble you know so

346.53 347.39 A: (( uh-hum )) 

349.71 361.20 A: i know that's the thing like i think 'cause it 'cause as you say you know children are the future and [sigh] if teachers are are a big part in in bringing children up [sigh] then you 

352.07 352.94 B: yeah 

361.00 368.07 A: know they should be paid a a good living wage and not have to buy their own supplies and stuff you know that stockholder be

451.95 454.60 A: i just i never get into it [laughter] 

453.90 457.25 B: oh yeah [laughter] i thought it would be big up there 

457.31 458.82 B: or over there 

458.30 466.41 A: oh yeah it is it's like it's big in scotland but i just [sigh] not one of the things that that i i get r- round to participating in 

461.28 463.27 B: oh [laughter] but you never [sigh] o- 

466.50 467.62 B: okay 

468.24 477.76 A: but um [sigh] so yes i don't know what what an awful lot of [cough] other experience of of public schools i mean definitely we're thinking of having [sigh] 

475.60 476.48 B: [laughter] 

477.82 483.63 A: children at some point in the future and you know where where we'll send them to school is a consideration 

480.49 481.79 B: [lipsmack] oh yeah 

483.94 491.61 B: [mn] yeah [mn] i mean that's what [noise] when people are moving [noise] to different cities that's one of the big points they want to move somewhere 

484.20 485.35 A: (( [noise] [cough] )) 

491.65 494.44 B: that has a sch- g- good s- school district to it 

493.82 502.46 A: yeah [sigh] and that can be difficult i think if you're moving to a new city you don't know or it can be very hard to [sigh] make sure to find out where the good good schools are 

499.02 500.23 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

502.30 503.77 B: yeah 

503.51 507.28 A: um [lipsmack] but it's definitely something that 

507.78 509.19 A: 'cause i definitely want my 

509.23 511.77 A: (( my children to have a good education )) 

511.43 512.55 B: [mn] oh yeah 

511.98 513.06 A: um 

513.11 518.79 A: and i think public schools are very important [sigh] but it's kind of hard because [sigh] 

519.60 524.63 A: you know i want to send them to to public school [sigh] but on the other hand 

524.90 528.12 A: you know a private school may get them a better education 

527.89 528.85 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

528.25 530.98 A: but it's it's going to be a difficult decision i think 

530.18 534.68 B: [sigh] [noise] well i think what's good is to send them to public schools for a couple of years 

534.02 535.24 A: uh-hum 

535.76 537.67 B: (( you know to g- get [sigh] )) 

537.91 545.70 B: to get introduced you know t- to like you say y- y- your upper class i mean [mn] go to a public school get some lower class [sigh] 

546.31 550.45 B: get some you know diversification get to know other people 

548.43 550.73 A: yeah i think that's really important uh-hum 

551.18 556.14 B: and then for a couple of years you go to a private school to really get your education [sigh] 

555.43 556.66 A: uh-hum 

557.25 561.80 B: 'cause um you know there are good s- there are s- some good public schools 

561.41 563.83 A: oh yeah i'm sure 

562.78 564.64 B: (( [sigh] mm and )) 

565.13 565.69 A: (( [sigh] )) 

565.16 572.52 B: um 'cause part of education is j- just individual having the person themselves want to want it [sigh] 

570.18 571.14 A: (( um uh-hum )) 

572.48 573.39 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

574.07 575.03 B: so 

575.07 577.39 B: [sigh] in private schools ah 

578.12 583.65 B: in public schools i think you know individuality [sigh] individuality comes out more 

583.45 584.78 A: yeah 

584.20 587.83 B: [mn] you know 'cause private schools they want you to dress the same way and you 

587.35 588.67 A: (( uh-hum )) 

588.68 590.47 B: know belong in groups 

589.37 594.67 A: 'cause even at the public school i went to like w- we we had to wear a uniform 

594.06 595.41 B: (( oh yeah )) 

594.83 595.92 A: um 

596.05 599.89 A: which i guess there's there's pros and cons to that 

599.11 599.95 B: yeah
