0.00 1.95 B: hi i'm david 

1.49 3.47 A: hello my name's michael 

2.88 3.72 B: (( hi )) 

3.78 5.97 B: w- w- where are you calling from 

5.43 8.14 A: i'm calling from um gainsville florida 

7.56 10.78 B: (( okay i'm in new york city yeah )) 

9.92 12.87 A: oh okay yeah my mom lives in new york city 

12.17 13.46 B: oh cool [noise] 

14.72 15.91 B: so um 

16.01 18.65 B: what do you feel about the topic [laughter] 

18.25 30.60 A: uh i feel um i guess i've i've never done drugs before and um i'm in the military i'm in the navy and i don't have a problem with you know employers testing people for drugs especially when 

30.48 33.93 A: there are other people lives at stake and involved i think 

33.99 35.12 A: you know 

35.18 43.88 A: you know if you wanna do drugs you know make sure you definitely away from no workplace or whatever you wanna do it but when it impacts the job and the lives of other people 

43.37 45.08 B: mhm 

43.98 48.57 A: i think there's there's no such thing as privacy when it comes to that 

48.65 54.78 B: yeah yeah e- exactly like if it if it's gonna have other ramifications 

54.82 57.70 B: um like in most cases it does if 

57.72 59.18 B: if you come into work 

59.36 62.24 B: under the s- you know under the influence of something 

62.78 73.89 B: it's it's gonna you know like impact not only your performance but have a have a indirect impact on the rest the rest of the company or a law firm or whatever 

74.37 75.62 B: so um 

75.90 77.09 A: (( yeah i guess )) 

77.15 78.66 A: i guess um 

78.71 87.05 A: you know with especially with the drugs like ecstasy and now ya- i guess you make drugs from anything in the household now they're saying so [laughter] 

86.48 93.86 B: [noise] mhm oh like paint thinners and [laughter] you c- i mean you can use anything pretty much it's like 

92.91 100.58 A: you know yeah yeah and i guess like that's i guess that's like anything if you use too much of anything you can get some type of form of high i guess but um 

99.95 100.92 B: right 

101.44 105.61 A: but um i guess a company has to protect itself 'cause 

105.68 112.98 A: you know if you're doing it on their job and like you say if something happened they're liable and not you don't wanna look at it that way of course but i'm just saying 

113.01 126.54 B: right i mean like experimentation when you're either in college or in your early twenties is one thing but like when you're you know ready for you know the responsibilities of a full time job 

113.76 115.09 A: (( but they're definitely )) 

126.89 127.81 B: (( you know you )) 

128.11 132.48 B: it's it's time to you know you know for a reality check 

132.53 144.18 B: and i guess something did happen you know if for some reason a compa- a major company didn't test for whatever reason i kn- i know the military tests so 

143.30 145.16 A: yeah [laughter] 

144.47 145.99 B: [laughter] 

145.20 149.80 A: so yeah hard to worry about [laughter] they they will definitely check and uh 

148.82 150.06 B: (( yeah )) 

150.45 162.73 A: and it's random for us as well random and like i say i don't have a problem 'cause you know in the military we have multi million dollar machinery and you have the lives of the people that depend on you 

162.06 163.37 B: right 

162.80 171.26 A: and we definitely can't have anything like you know if they come and found out that you was on you o- operated something on the influence of something that impaired your 

169.44 170.65 B: mhm 

171.32 179.95 A: you know your vision or your motor skills or physical skills or anything like that yeah people lives at stake there definitely so 

179.76 181.35 B: (( yeah )) 

180.67 184.22 A: we probably are the strictest [noise] out of everyone of 

184.83 185.83 B: pardon 

185.86 188.53 A: i say we're probably the strictest as far as testing 

187.89 189.72 B: oh yeah yes it's 

188.69 189.62 A: so 

190.03 193.20 B: it's very hard to get into military these days [laughter] 

192.79 202.49 A: i mean even though i mean you can get into the military even if you've done drugs before you know if anything that's happened to you you can't change anything that happened to you in the future i mean the past rather 

194.19 194.80 B: (( mm )) 

197.89 198.97 B: right 

202.72 207.64 A: but like i said um if you come in on that i think it's a drug puts you on there 

207.85 213.83 A: and um so i guess to prevent if you do it again i guess they can get you out or whatever 

213.19 214.53 B: (( mm right )) 

215.79 225.00 A: but um uh i- i- it's and it seems like you know even though um you see more and more things about drugs a lot of people are still u- using it 

224.72 233.08 B: right right like there's there's more awareness about the the medical impact of of drugs 

233.12 241.20 B: and the and it's it's not worth the high and or the you know like if for example ecstasy that's 

241.39 246.74 B: you get high for like a day and then you're depressed for four days afterwards or whatever 

246.95 258.93 B: and that part of it's not i don't think it's worth it for you know whoever has used it in the past but just from what i've he- heard that's that's its impact and 

258.82 262.94 B: plus if you get caught with them f- you know by the police then [mn] you 

263.41 266.28 B: know that's that's breaking the law 

266.48 267.40 B: (( so )) 

269.22 270.99 A: yeah 

271.52 281.09 A: it's all around though a lot of people even i guess i guess i'm i don't even wanna do anything to jeopardize my sense of um 

281.42 284.13 A: rationale or my awareness 

283.64 285.08 B: mhm 

284.25 285.56 A: (( [laughter] you know i guess )) 

285.74 296.89 A: i guess i don't you i guess you can never criticize a person and everything unless you walk through their shoes but i just you know yeah like you said it uh it doesn't seem worth it to try certain things 

297.06 299.64 A: when you know the ramifications or 

299.96 303.82 A: (( the backlash or [noise] )) 

304.60 307.93 A: any type of pain that you might go through after the fact you know 

306.90 308.81 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

309.07 311.86 A: and it just doesn't seem worth it to me i guess 

311.42 312.36 B: (( yeah )) 

313.05 313.93 B: oh like 

313.94 319.44 B: and for example like abusing alcohol i mean you can get drunk and then 

319.55 326.02 B: but you have to deal with the hangover the next day and that's just not that is not totally not worth it now it's like 

322.05 323.42 A: right [laughter] 

325.94 336.78 B: i mean i'm pushing thirty and you know it was one thing when you're in your early twenties and just becoming legal or whatever to you know to drink but i was l- 

335.73 336.75 A: right 

336.74 342.41 B: you know i i can remember an occasional hangover and i'm like this sucks like the day after 

340.64 341.97 A: (( oh yeah [noise] )) 

342.43 345.93 B: is no fun after you're blitzed and 

345.68 352.58 A: especially when you throwing up and oh my goodness and don't remember what you did and 

348.11 348.99 B: (( ugh )) 

350.76 353.56 B: right it was just nasty and so 

354.24 356.02 A: definitely not something i 

356.03 360.56 A: ever wanted to do again [laughter] but it's like you say you know 

357.51 358.82 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

361.01 370.87 A: that is i don't understand you know people would do that and then go to work the next day or even go into work intoxicated anything like that 

363.54 364.66 B: (( mhm )) 

371.07 373.12 A: just just don't know what type of 

373.27 376.18 A: (( mental process they're using at the time i guess )) 

375.73 377.63 B: (( yes and )) 

378.21 379.64 B: um 

379.95 382.14 B: i i i mean it's a sensible 

382.53 387.98 B: um you know d- drug testing anywhere be- just because 

388.58 390.69 A: (( yeah i do i i totally agree with )) 

389.95 399.07 B: an employer wants to know what they're you know who and what they're doing with like if a drug test came back positive they'd be like you know what's up with this 

400.10 408.68 B: you know they they could probably suggest counselling or whatever but i mean at the t- at the time of your positive drug test you know they they would have to say you know 

409.42 414.38 B: uh check back with us in six months to a year after you're sober [laughter] or 

411.50 412.24 A: (( you )) 

413.43 415.63 A: (( [noise] i heard that )) 

414.51 415.84 B: or clean 

416.42 425.81 A: yeah i me- like i said you can't blame 'em you know these things i mean all jobs are so inter- intertwined 

425.20 426.50 B: right 

426.01 430.10 A: you know you in some way you will come into you know 

430.63 437.60 A: you know your job will affect something along the line and will cause something to really be severe 

437.36 439.05 B: mhm 

437.95 441.58 A: cause some malfunction or something 

441.81 450.46 A: catastrophic and no one wants to take be a part or have anything to do with anything like that especially they trying to promote a business you know so 

449.65 450.95 B: right 

452.31 458.53 A: i mean i i don't i don't blame 'em and i agree with you i think it's a and i don't think it's violating anyone rights you 

460.43 468.27 A: know if you and i don't know any type of profession you probably could do when you was drugged and i guess it's the the music industry or acting career maybe [laughter] you know 

468.97 470.56 A: but any i i guess 

469.60 477.15 B: yeah well creative arts it tends to be i mean it since you're you're more your own boss in in those fields 

471.61 473.83 A: yeah that's true yeah 

477.57 482.87 B: you know it can kinda get brushed under the carpet um 

482.93 485.59 B: c- unless you're like representing 

485.63 490.19 B: a like a record company or entire 

490.89 496.62 B: industry i i think there's more leeway with you know with with creative arts 

497.58 500.94 B: um or you know to to hide it easier 

501.81 502.83 A: (( right mhm )) 

502.84 515.56 B: but hollywood and new york are still like bi- i mean huge drug havens um as are many other you know cities and even in the the small towns like i mean you you can 

515.37 518.60 B: you know you read it on or see it in um 

518.96 521.21 B: different all these news programs 

521.48 522.75 B: um 

522.87 530.71 B: i i remember seeing one one show where this guy was using um g- g._b._h. 

531.19 538.95 B: this this drug and his kids were like embarassed for him they were like oh that's not my dad he's 

539.01 552.10 B: you know just whacked out on this drug and you know were trying to get his fa- their father help and he ended up in prison and all this stuff and it's just it's a a no win situation when you when you think of all the 

552.02 555.75 B: like if you really get caught up in that in that entire scene 

556.05 561.49 A: yeah yeah especially i guess the way they're making them now they're making them very addictive and so 

561.55 566.04 A: like if you use it once i mean it's like you can't stop [sigh] you 

565.06 566.36 B: (( so yeah )) 

566.56 568.17 A: (( know i mean i mean )) 

568.57 580.01 A: i just i don't really i don't that's something like i said i just can't take the risk i don't want no me want my mind to be controlled by [laughter] some type of drug or whatever i tell you 

576.86 578.54 B: mhm 

579.87 581.14 B: (( yeah )) 

581.40 590.19 A: [sigh] but um like like you saying big cities it is it is getting it is getting pretty much where you can't escape drugs i don't care what small town you come from 

589.43 592.74 B: mhm you can get access to them yeah
