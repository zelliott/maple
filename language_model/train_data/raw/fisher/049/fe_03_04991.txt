265.20 266.87 A: right it's 

265.80 269.23 B: and what about you feel it's necessary for everybody 

269.44 275.89 A: well i mean to every person their own but for me i like it's how i get rid of my stress and what not so 

269.46 270.02 B: (( [noise] )) 

275.01 276.14 B: mhm 

275.81 287.41 A: i couldn't really do without it and i do tend to get depressed like i notice myself like if i'm starting to get down it's because i've noticed like in my experience that i haven't been to the gym in a couple of weeks and what not 

286.59 293.76 B: okay yeah if if i even miss a week i can feel it and i usually go after work i just work part time and usually go

303.64 305.28 A: (( [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

309.22 313.21 B: i advise everybody i mean even if you don't do the gym 

313.38 323.62 B: even if you just walk or even if you just even just to be alone with walking or um or riding a bike or i'm not a swimmer but i do know that that's 

323.69 326.71 B: as you get older it's supposed to be very good for you [mn] 

325.66 328.61 A: yeah 'cause it's no weight on your joints and what not 

327.73 337.89 B: right and also all you know all of the water exercises so [sigh] that's one of my mantras [laughter] if someone doesn't feel good i just say take a walk

360.94 362.13 A: oh definitely [noise] 

361.75 374.73 B: so there is many many pluses and when this topic when i saw that this was one of the topics in fact i got excited because there is not many you know if you asked me what one of what some of the things i do 

374.72 377.79 B: exercising is definitely definitely 

376.96 378.78 A: that's good 

377.96 379.48 B: definitely up there 

379.38 382.44 A: do you do like aerobic classes or anything at all ever 

381.82 395.31 B: but you know what i don't just because i get tired so soon and i should and i st- i've started them before and i've been in the ones with the music and i know there's pi- pilates and there is 

386.13 387.05 A: okay 

395.48 409.05 B: spin cycling and there's lots of other ones but i guess i don't really want to be tie excuse me a minute [cough] coughing a lot i don't really want to be pin pinned down to an hour or so i mean i have to be somewhere at a certain time 

398.27 399.22 A: mhm 

405.84 406.80 A: right 

409.01 409.97 A: of course 

409.37 413.82 B: you know you have that for work and for other things and this way if i go to the gym 

411.93 412.87 A: mhm 

413.87 416.58 B: [lipsmack] i can just exercise at what i want 

415.71 418.61 A: yeah well as long as you're disciplined about it it's not really an issue 

417.36 420.72 B: what about you do you find guys doing um the aerobics 

420.88 427.83 A: um i actually saw well you'll see like the ratio will be like twenty five to like twenty five girls to two guys 

427.31 428.32 B: uh-huh 

427.91 435.02 A: more because of just like oh aerobics they're for girls and whatever but i think that's starting to break out of its mould 

432.11 433.22 B: [laughter] 

434.13 438.82 B: 'cause i thought even the ballet da- i mean i thought even the football players sometimes did aerobics 

438.66 444.51 A: oh really um they have their own gym 'cause they're all spoiled here but i really [laughter] couldn't tell ya 

439.35 440.30 B: yeah 

442.46 443.38 B: (( uh-huh )) 

444.40 450.98 B: mhm and what do they have in the winter up there for fitness then they all do they have skiing and ice skating up there too 

450.18 462.32 A: i know there's an ice skating rink somewhere around here but then there's also tussey mountain which is like um a local like there's like a couple of slopes for people who want to ski or snow tube or snowboard but i've never been out there 

459.87 460.88 B: okay 

461.77 465.40 B: and what do you do during the summer anything different than the exercises 

465.89 470.59 A: um i'm in the gym like year round so um other than that not really 

470.05 472.47 B: okay so you go to school year round 

472.26 479.13 A: yeah well actually no i mean um i'm up here this summer because i'm volunteering at community health center 

472.62 473.95 B: oh where are you from 

478.70 479.69 B: okay 

479.39 480.65 A: but um 

483.09 486.21 A: i'm from king of prussia and we just recently moved 

485.76 487.35 B: [sigh] okay yeah 

486.67 488.61 A: parents have sold up yeah so 

487.59 493.48 B: yeah my son works in king of prussia so i know he he lives in reading and works in king of prussia so 

489.91 490.71 A: (( oh )) 

493.42 508.09 B: he commutes every day so i i do know that area and it's nice but as i say we're on [sigh] the other part of the state and i've never done a walkathon and i keep saying that i will and i keep signing up for them and getting the t. shirts 

496.51 497.55 A: mhm 

508.13 509.52 B: and 

508.49 511.32 A: what's keeping you back would you say 

510.25 517.62 B: probably 'cause the the the last one was the susan komen for cancer 'cause they were all meeting at six o'clock in the morning and 

514.59 515.53 A: mhm 

517.22 518.50 A: oh god 

517.88 526.60 B: i work at night i work this is an early night but i don't usually get home till after ten o'clock and i guess it's just getting up and doing it but 

527.06 531.11 B: [lipsmack] anyhow it sounds like we're both going in the right direction 

530.23 532.46 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

531.71 533.01 B: sounds good though 

533.60 534.64 B: well 

534.74 539.49 B: what else do you like to do up there then do you read a lot then i know we're getting off the topic but [noise] 

538.96 540.07 A: um 

541.02 546.54 A: i'm getting better with partying that was a big issue for me in my younger years i'm now a senior so 

544.87 546.95 B: you mean too much or not enough 

546.92 551.03 A: to way too much before now now it's definitely toned down a bit 

547.53 548.83 B: [laughter] 

550.47 552.26 B: okay mhm 

551.54 554.26 A: but um yeah like i'm trying 

552.54 557.17 B: well you probably don't drink if you exercise 'cause i don't think the two of them go together 

557.06 560.18 A: no you you definitely have to either take it easy or uh 

560.38 563.47 A: plan it out so you hit the gym before you go out basically 

562.96 567.87 B: [laughter] oh i see i meant not at all but i guess um 

563.74 564.82 A: [laughter] 

567.90 571.24 A: no if you have the will you can do it [laughter] 

567.93 569.52 B: (( oh and it's a whole )) 

570.33 581.43 B: but it's a whole different group of people who exercise too because i find the people who exercise really are the ones who keep their minds busy also at least you know they're the ones who read and they're the ones who 

577.80 578.85 A: that's true 

581.64 585.53 B: just keep up on everything and the people i know who don't exercise 

585.54 587.38 B: um 

587.45 590.19 B: we just you know we just have different things in interest 

590.22 591.28 B: in common 

590.30 599.89 A: mhm it clears your head and stuff so it definitely helps like they say after you exercise your brain has a lot more ex- or oxygen going to it to help you study and what not and read 

598.81 599.89 B: oh i believe it
