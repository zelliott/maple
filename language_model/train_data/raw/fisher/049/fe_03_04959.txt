1.89 2.97 A: hello 

2.63 3.92 B: (( hello )) 

4.03 5.57 B: hi i'm deborah 

4.07 4.97 A: hi 

5.29 6.37 A: i'm john 

6.28 9.00 B: hi john i live in california 

9.18 11.56 A: oh i live in pennsylvania 

11.57 12.82 B: (( wow )) 

13.77 22.16 B: so let's see [mn] i only heard half of what the topic was she said censorship when she first came on but then i missed the part about schools 

22.20 26.67 A: yeah they ah i didn't catch it all but basically i think they said 

26.79 27.89 A: um 

28.38 34.52 A: does a school public or private have the right and i wasn't quite sure if they said require 

34.59 37.84 A: or keep student from reading certain books 

38.11 39.36 B: (( hm [lipsmack] )) 

40.80 47.19 B: well i have mixed emotions [laughter] i know that when i was in school they um 

44.04 44.86 A: i do too 

47.37 51.52 B: told that they banned us from reading the book the color purple 

52.62 53.61 A: okay 

52.70 58.68 B: [mn] a long time ago [laughter] but i it just made me wanna go out and read it 

55.24 56.82 A: i've heard of it 

58.83 71.88 B: and i didn't think the content was anything that was too i couldn't understand why they banned it and it irritated me i remember i wrote a ah a letter to the sc- to the local newspaper about censorship because it's like once they start taking baby step 

71.94 73.99 B: where does it stop you know 

74.70 75.98 B: so ah 

76.06 78.97 B: i don't know i have mixed emotions on it 

78.64 83.94 A: i know a friend of mine his boy was in school and 

84.57 86.22 A: they i 

87.28 89.13 A: believe what it was 

89.69 93.31 A: [lipsmack] is they was gonna make reading a certain book required 

92.98 94.00 B: uh-huh 

94.34 95.93 A: and it was a 

97.59 102.83 A: i don't know what it was but i know it was going against christianity and he was a christian 

101.70 102.55 B: oh 

102.63 103.68 B: uh-huh 

103.94 108.24 A: and um him and another few of the other students kind of 

108.39 110.43 A: made a stink about it and ah 

110.51 111.89 A: the students won 

112.65 115.42 B: and so they didn't they weren't forced to read it 

114.82 116.40 A: right 

116.42 120.39 A: so at that point i can say 

116.72 118.53 B: yeah 

121.17 122.45 A: that's great 

123.12 130.19 A: um i guess like i said it depends on how the question was set i didn't catch whether it was forced to or kept from 

130.34 131.62 B: yeah 

130.65 132.71 A: i don't believe the schools 

133.17 141.50 A: should be forced to read anything outside of a private school and i say that only because at a private school the parents 

141.78 149.89 A: choose to send the student there if they don't believe in the views of the private school then they shouldn't have sent him there and they have the right to pull him ah back out 

143.51 144.52 B: uh-huh 

150.08 154.32 B: yeah that's true i hadn't thought of that in terms of if it was a private school 

154.42 156.22 B: i mean i i i 

156.24 170.68 B: i totally get that they're trying to expand students horizons and expose them to different things but i don't think the students' grades should be based on reading material that's forced if it really is contrary to their views you know 

170.46 171.36 A: yeah 

171.14 175.60 B: um unless they can read it and try and see the other side of the coin but 

175.71 179.42 B: ah the parents may have more to say about that than the kids you know 

179.21 185.15 A: right i know this same friend of mine his boy also after he won that battle he wanted to go in 

185.42 191.35 A: and ah further knock out certain books from being in the library which 

191.63 195.06 A: at which point his father wouldn't let him he says look you won your battle 

195.30 197.37 B: yeah and i think too 

195.65 203.81 A: either they will or they won't they won't make you do it but those who wish to still have that option and i i i agree with that so 

201.28 203.20 B: exactly it's like 

203.40 210.79 B: i agree too it's like okay that's fine if you don't want read it but you can't prohibit other people from reading it that's a you know i guess that's where 

209.26 214.32 A: provided yeah provided provided it's age appropriate 

210.80 212.55 B: the democracy comes in 

214.35 218.65 B: yeah oh well yeah i mean i think if a teacher comes in with something that's 

219.28 232.45 B: you know [sigh] not age appropriate i i think the r- the parents or and or the students have a right to say you know what i want alternate reading material and they should be able to get it with out any kind of fuss being made 

232.46 233.43 A: right 

233.70 240.72 B: um so i yeah but i do agree that um i don't like that when they prohibit you rom 

240.73 244.00 B: f rom reading something it's like don't force me to read it but don't 

244.03 245.38 B: don't tell me that 

245.87 248.67 B: you know take it out of the library and say i can't read it 

248.93 254.11 B: just 'cause i experienced that in school and it was i couldn't understand i thought well i'm you know 

254.47 257.21 B: let me make my own choices in that regard 

254.91 255.58 A: (( right )) 

257.00 261.29 A: right and and that's where it'll i feel the parents duty comes in to 

261.51 272.76 A: instill whatever morals they want in their child to select appropriate reading material and i'll grant they're not there at study hall to watch over 'em but 

268.57 270.25 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

272.66 277.57 A: you know at at at high school level when they're given these choices well it's 

277.87 282.41 A: it's just part of growing up process and i guess they're making some dec- decisions 

279.12 282.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

282.62 287.77 B: yeah [noise] no i i definitely agree eps- especially because 

288.31 297.58 B: you know you entrust your child to the school and they're but there needs to be a checks and balances you know 

297.38 298.32 A: mhm 

297.66 299.87 B: if the materials they're 

300.53 302.19 B: assigning isn't 

302.91 306.15 B: like you said age appropriate or if it's something that's 

306.26 308.04 B: contradictory to what 

308.20 311.28 B: their belief system is they shouldn't be forced to read it 

311.68 312.55 A: yeah 

312.59 314.66 B: yeah definitely 

314.19 316.77 A: this is too simple we agree on everything 

316.29 318.61 B: (( i know [laughter] )) 

317.89 322.75 A: they've they called me earlier today and i i got another fellow from california 

322.46 323.68 B: [laughter] 

323.39 328.29 A: and ah he was out on some beach in i don't know where it was at but he 

328.42 332.02 A: we had differences of opinion let's put it that way [laughter] 

331.00 335.22 B: oh really [laughter] you guys debated everything [laughter] 

332.19 332.95 A: (( yes )) 

334.13 338.69 A: um let's put it this way he was a lot more liberal than what i am 

338.44 349.04 B: oh well i'm liberal but it depends on it [mn] [lipsmack] i i [sigh] i'm i guess i'm liberal on some issues but then there's other things that 

349.20 352.49 B: especially as i get older i think well you know 

352.71 359.38 B: i i don't know that i agree with that across the board you know i guess it's topic by topic and 

356.30 357.16 A: yeah 

358.52 360.28 A: i try to be 

360.57 364.00 A: i try to be open minded for the simple fact that 

364.54 368.36 A: um i i try to put myself 

368.75 372.28 A: in other people's shoes and 

372.71 377.63 A: see if the treatment i i want would be proper for 

377.89 379.66 A: you know somebody else 

379.47 380.55 B: yeah 

380.54 384.83 A: and ah sometimes i catch myself where hm maybe i'm not thinking right 

384.64 392.62 B: [laughter] well and i guess that's where this whole you know forced reading requirement i let's say i was you know 

393.21 396.61 B: buddhist and they wanted me to read something about you know 

396.87 402.88 B: i don't know some a forced reading requirement was something about islam or you know christianity 

402.98 411.04 B: i would be interested to hear what to read it just to see what the take is not necessarily that i subscribe to it so i i do have a hard time imagining 

408.31 409.42 A: exactly 

410.99 419.68 B: somebody wouldn't want to be as informed as possible and know as much as possible but i don't think they should be forced to read it if they don't want to 

419.13 421.61 A: yeah i i mean i guess you're a christian 

421.71 422.81 B: (( yeah )) 

422.81 424.36 A: that makes two of us no 

424.13 436.81 B: but i wouldn't but i but if i was in school and they wanted me to read something about you know ah mormonism or something i wouldn't not read it i would wanna be as informed about other people's beliefs and be possible 

435.05 440.78 A: yeah how how yeah how can you argue your own faith if you don't know the flaws of someone elses mhm 

440.57 445.30 B: exactly so i would that's where i guess i get caught up because 

445.36 449.40 B: i can't imagine like that you said your friend's son 

449.52 453.98 B: wouldn't wanna read the book and fought to have it [mn] i'd be like well 

453.81 467.77 B: sure i would've been in what why they believed they believed or whatever the books was about even if it was about you know the fact that the devil ruled the world or something i'd be like well let me read and see where the author's coming from and and try and understand that point of view not that i subscribe to it 

467.62 468.51 A: yeah 

467.84 471.48 B: so i get caught up 

468.85 469.85 A: (( well )) 

469.99 473.96 A: i know my wife and i won't let our kids read ah the harry potter books 

473.98 480.23 A: and if that if that was pushed at the school i think i would go school board 

473.98 475.91 B: oh really 

480.65 483.73 B: just because of the whole ah magic of it 

483.57 485.23 A: yes yes 

484.72 490.09 B: oh yeah see i don't get caught up in that that doesn't bother the mysticism doesn't 

490.06 501.66 B: [mn] those books don't bother i haven't read them but like i know my niece and nephew have read them and um no i don't doesn't bother me i don't particularly enjoy the book i tried reading it but i didn't like it 

500.87 503.35 A: mm 

501.94 504.58 B: so um yeah i don't get caught up on that 

505.87 506.75 B: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

508.99 510.06 B: anyway 

511.58 514.24 A: gee these ten minutes ain't going fast enough 

512.49 525.52 B: [laughter] [laughter] i know [laughter] not a big debater i guess [laughter] i'm not you know it's like people believe what they believe and i i just like to be informed so 

519.13 520.07 A: yeah 

525.06 526.96 A: (( yeah i know it's )) 

525.83 526.51 B: (( i )) 

527.33 528.55 A: (( ah )) 

529.04 531.79 A: i know we talked about ah in high school 

532.09 533.32 A: ah someone 

534.41 538.58 A: we got a lot of debate about this and it was like should we sponsor 

538.72 543.43 A: other faiths you know like well some of them wanted to go ah with the darwinist and one or two 

543.44 545.98 A: prayed to a tree during commencement 

546.35 549.67 A: and i thought well no that's ridiculous 

549.17 550.27 B: [laughter] 

549.94 554.55 A: and then they was like well then why should we let you pray to your god 

555.40 556.03 B: (( mm )) 

555.71 558.85 A: and okay touche i guess you got me there 

557.34 558.38 B: yeah 

559.53 562.67 A: and if for that reason you know i do 

563.17 571.33 A: y- you have to allow certain things whether you subscribe to it or not but you have to allow certain things to have an open society 

568.11 569.71 B: mhm 

572.01 574.64 A: which is where censorship becomes 

572.01 573.04 B: yeah 

574.97 581.25 A: ah a sticky situation in certain areas i mean ah when it comes to required reading 

577.63 578.85 B: mhm 

582.08 584.45 A: um 

585.40 588.15 A: i guess like i said depends on the 

588.39 589.37 A: ah 

589.57 591.23 A: on the reading itself 

590.94 592.25 B: yeah 

591.33 599.89 A: whether whether it's like you say within buddhism i i'd love to know more about it because just talking about the ah the theol- 

596.01 597.02 B: yeah
