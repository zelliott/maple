0.94 3.94 B: uh this is nico- this is nicole 

1.17 2.09 A: (( hello )) 

4.56 6.41 A: hi this is john 

6.67 12.11 B: okay and the uh the question of the day is has the increase 

12.35 14.94 B: of divorce rates [mn] 

14.72 19.01 A: influenced your views of marriage as an institution or something 

19.03 20.83 B: uh okay 

20.98 22.15 B: um 

22.74 24.63 B: well let's see 

24.47 27.94 A: it's such a like loaded question i feel like [laughter] 

27.69 28.81 B: it's what 

28.45 30.12 A: it's kind of like a 

30.67 37.28 A: loaded question 'cause they're asking you like specifically has the divorce rate [mn] like affected 

36.93 38.59 B: right right 

37.52 44.90 A: my view i don't i mean i think there's a lot of things in general that affects somebody's view of marriage 

44.90 46.32 B: mhm 

45.03 47.63 A: [mn] more than just like the divorce rate 

48.02 53.21 B: yeah well i i mean for me i know that um the divorce 

53.26 61.95 B: you know with my family you know my parents that definitely i think it a- altered my you know my view of um 

62.57 70.34 B: of marriage and altered you know as a as a institution so i mean i would say i would yeah 

65.00 66.16 A: (( really )) 

66.92 68.68 A: why were your parents divorced 

69.74 70.73 A: oh they are 

70.73 77.29 B: yeah i would say the increase in um i would say yeah it does definitely i mean it does alter my view 

77.48 82.79 B: just because [mn] you know it it goes to show you that [mn] more you know more people 

83.26 92.47 B: are um are getting divorced and so it gives me it gives me less hope in in you know in the in the idea of of of the marriage 

92.28 93.52 A: right 

93.28 94.75 B: and um 

95.55 102.33 B: and you know and and and i mean i i come from a pretty you know like liberal background in terms of um 

102.91 110.41 B: actual you know the paper marriage like not a religious background where in a lot of religious backgrounds those paper marriages are 

107.67 108.55 A: uh-huh 

110.60 119.83 B: [mn] i mean regular marriages are really important for religion and i don't come from a religious background so as a result um i just think it's a lot of i mean it's 

120.24 130.36 B: it seems like a big hassle you know 'cause if you do get divorced [laughter] and um then it's you know it's it makes it a lot more complicated so when you're 

129.39 130.40 A: right 

130.50 135.10 B: but i mean i can understand too how it would be you know if in the right situation 

135.10 147.45 B: um it would be it would be a good thing but i [mn] you know i don't know i've yet to necessarily you know know that something is going to definitely work out or something like that so it would it would seem like a a big step 

146.80 148.61 A: mhm 

148.25 155.54 B: um and also the [mn] you know with the combi- with all the financial you know complications too which is another thing 

155.52 157.22 A: yeah 

156.38 165.02 B: um anyway so that's kind of my but i do i do think that um everytime i hear about a divorce you know it kind of makes me i'm a a bit cynical about it 

165.21 166.50 A: what do you mean 

166.93 169.30 B: cynical like cynical like 

167.34 167.90 A: (( [mn] )) 

168.22 171.98 A: yeah i mean but how like is that just because like 

169.64 170.91 B: mhm 

172.05 175.45 A: of your experience with it since your parents were divorced or 

175.70 178.29 A: [lipsmack] would you say that's the main influence um 

178.33 179.74 B: um 

180.72 182.05 B: probably 

180.99 188.36 A: like would you rather like w- would would you s- are you thinking like why are they getting divorced why don't they work it out or are you more like 

188.64 190.87 A: what are you thinking like 

190.52 197.85 B: well i just know that it takes i know that it it takes two people to and a lot you know everybody has problems and if 

197.71 206.99 B: if both people aren't willing to really look at themselves and deal with their issues you know and and be honest in in a relationship then 

202.42 203.56 A: mhm 

207.08 221.83 B: um you know then one person could be trying to hold the relationship together and if the other person is just you know in denial and not willing to you know give the fifty percent i think if people can work it out i think it's a lot easier 

222.06 230.96 B: um i definitely think it's a lot easier and i think you know for both [mn] and and especially you know for the kids i think it's it's a lot easier 

222.66 223.64 A: right 

228.76 233.41 A: mhm yeah [mn] how how old were you when your parents were 

233.42 235.02 A: (( got divorced )) 

234.56 235.78 B: uh seven 

235.64 236.59 A: (( oh okay )) 

237.02 238.71 B: yeah yeah 

238.89 248.20 B: so um yeah that that's definitely that's definitely my opinion i mean i think it yeah i think if both people are willing but if you have you know one person who's 

242.17 243.03 A: it was 

248.36 254.34 B: um you know and also just the traditional values of a woman and a man and a family you know it's 

254.04 255.03 A: right 

254.40 256.81 B: i don't know it's hard for me to really 

257.46 264.88 B: to really [sigh] feel like there's a there's fairness in the general like american family or pretty much any any family 

265.01 276.78 B: you know and i know you know there's so much so many instances of abuse and and you know things that are bad for children to be around and that kind of thing and if that's the case you know i don't think they should try to stay together 

276.79 284.87 A: right yeah i mean there's i would say i would agree there's definitely extenuating circumstances where a divorce i think is in order 

285.03 285.91 A: you know 

286.40 288.59 A: whether it be like abuse or 

288.67 290.22 B: mhm mhm 

289.42 292.47 A: so i mean i guess with children aren't involved then 

292.56 294.95 A: it could be debatable you know 

295.06 296.12 B: right 

296.22 299.47 A: like my parents are very loving like they've never 

299.48 301.85 A: had any problems that i'm aware of you know 

301.87 305.47 A: but i know that you know they had both been married before 

305.55 308.25 B: oh so you have a different view [laughter] 

305.74 306.95 A: and um 

307.63 309.28 A: right so they 

309.99 311.17 A: like 

312.18 320.56 A: i mean both my mom and dad like would say that like their other s- their previous spouse was the one that 

320.92 328.18 A: initiated the divorce and everything i guess or like my mom's [mn] first husband like slept around all the time you know 

323.57 325.09 B: mhm 

328.21 339.65 A: so she got a divorced him or whatever and there were no ki- well actually no my dad had two sons so i have two half brothers [mn] that are forty three and forty i'm twenty three so 

328.26 330.02 B: yeah yeah 

334.51 335.52 B: mhm 

339.18 340.64 B: mhm mhm 

339.73 342.35 A: so they're a lot older me and i never really knew 'em you know 

342.47 348.27 A: i've only like been around 'em a handful of times but he uh 

342.60 343.70 B: mhm 

347.10 354.75 B: yeah well that's an example of that's an example of something that can be really destructive in that you know you might not [mn] just get away from 

355.16 357.43 B: if if they can't change 

358.63 360.37 A: yeah 

359.56 360.71 B: mhm 

360.76 363.39 A: like yeah like 

362.62 376.97 B: well any- any- anything that's you know like a i don't know if you see that as a as part of a disease or an illness or i don't know i mean that's something i've kind of learned about it you know people often will do that because [mn] you know they it's a compulsive behaviour 

376.78 377.79 A: what what 

377.02 382.35 B: whether it whether it's drinking or drugs or anything else yeah 

378.12 378.95 A: (( what )) 

380.00 381.99 A: right right 

382.38 385.19 A: (( yeah it's when i mean )) 

382.96 383.79 B: (( but )) 

385.32 386.30 A: they 

386.81 392.31 A: you know both stayed like my i grew up a strong christian home and um they 

391.27 392.46 B: (( uh oh okay )) 

392.33 398.12 A: they both you know my mom was like well you know john that was before i was a christian and i'd just you know she was a lot younger and she 

398.41 406.18 A: claims that she didn't have her life together and my dad would say somewhat the same thing not to the extent my mom would say that but 

405.97 407.20 B: mhm 

406.34 408.24 A: and so now like i mean 

409.49 415.46 A: i don't know so i don't know see i was always like i always had the viewpoint on divorce that you know i thought it was 

415.59 427.34 A: you know wrong and that people should always try to stay together and it was better for family values you know family values in general to stay together but then i always forgot that just because my i have such a nuclear family and everything 

419.71 421.00 B: mhm 

426.95 428.27 B: mhm 

427.15 431.50 A: but then i forget that oh wait a minute you know my parents were divorced before 

431.96 435.47 A: they were married you know they had been married before and so it's kind of like a 

436.27 438.12 A: double standard like the way 

438.73 439.73 B: right 

439.75 444.71 A: you know like if i would grow up carrying their viewpoint on divorce but they 

440.92 441.92 B: mhm 

444.79 446.53 A: but then it's like whoa 

446.55 449.44 A: (( you guys were divorced what are you talking about )) 

449.16 458.00 B: right right yeah well it sounds like what um are you were you did you grow up in a city or did you grow up in the coun- in the coun- country 

450.82 451.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

457.14 463.07 A: i grew up in a big city in grand rapids michigan it's the second largest city in michigan so it was 

463.13 464.27 B: yeah 

463.21 471.00 A: a cult- um a larger city cultured environment it was nothing it wasn't the still a very conservative city because there's a lot of um 

467.31 467.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

471.57 475.39 A: a lot of churches there and everything so it was nothing like um 

473.64 474.87 B: right 

475.73 478.07 A: a large liberal city but 

477.18 483.64 B: do you know if you had any this is you know obviously you don't have to answer [laughter] this but do you know do you know if you had any um 

480.98 482.57 A: no yeah 

484.13 488.35 B: any like alcoholism in your family background or anything like that 

487.49 495.35 A: um yeah actually my uncle my mom's brother um was an alcoholic and just died this past year drunk 

494.46 497.13 B: are you kidding oh my god 

495.46 496.51 A: yeah 

497.26 502.79 A: yeah and my mom i've never seen my parents uh never seen my mom drink ever 

497.36 498.87 B: wow 

502.91 503.91 A: um 

503.02 503.83 B: mhm 

504.31 515.37 A: or like maybe once you know but they they never drank when we were growing up and my mom says now that i'm older you know and i'm old enough to drink and i'll have you know have something to drink every now and then and i'll be like you know 

506.85 507.49 B: (( mm )) 

515.72 522.83 A: why don't you guys ever just like have one with dinner or whatever and my mom's like well john i used to have a problem with drinking 

522.77 524.17 B: oh really 

523.78 526.51 A: and i don't know if she really did or she 

525.37 526.92 B: she just told you this 

526.98 531.36 A: she's told me this now that i'm older yeah like when i was turning twenty one or twenty two 

529.31 531.86 B: wow that's amazing 

531.89 533.73 A: and she's like you know john 

534.22 539.49 A: she that's why and she never wanted to drink around us because she never wanted to be the one because she knew 

539.36 549.71 A: that it ran in the family with her brother and she said you know i never want to be the one that introduces you to it if you know if you end up having a problem with it or something 

549.14 551.26 B: right right right 

550.31 556.87 A: so she just never but i would've almost rather seen her or seen them be able to drink in moderation 

557.38 558.33 B: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

557.98 561.53 A: than just uh completely abstaining you know 

561.80 564.66 B: well but they can't because of their illness 

563.03 566.35 A: but maybe she yeah if she yeah i see 

564.99 579.22 B: if she has a if she was [mn] if she drank too much and she had an illness she can't [mn] drink because that's the nature of the beast it it's it's like [mn] then it just t- turns it then it turns your life upside down actually 

572.49 573.94 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

578.97 579.86 A: okay 

579.20 581.94 B: because uh yeah i mean it's uh
