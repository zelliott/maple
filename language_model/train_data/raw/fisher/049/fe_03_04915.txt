0.12 1.26 A: hello 

0.77 2.83 B: (( [noise] hi how you doing riley )) 

2.85 4.14 A: hi my name's yan 

4.12 5.29 B: (( uh yes [sigh] )) 

5.89 8.23 B: well um i think um 

8.63 14.93 B: ah drug testing is you know not a bad thing it could be a i feel a good thing 

10.05 10.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

15.49 25.05 B: i don't think it's an invasion of privacy you know if you're employed with a company you should be able to you know main- be drug free and if you are you have nothing to hide [noise] 

26.43 29.08 A: [noise] yeah i feel the same way too because um 

29.57 32.99 A: um like if the ha- company hire you they should be 

33.20 38.27 A: aware that you have such habits in case you are addicted to any kind of drug 

37.94 39.22 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

38.56 52.48 A: because ah it can affect the company's reputation along with your efficiency at work and your colleagues and um knowing that you take drugs should be a determining factor as whether or not you're able to work 

52.34 55.13 B: right and i also think that e- even 

52.94 54.96 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

55.19 60.42 B: like while you're empl- employed there you know they wanna you know spot check 

60.67 62.42 B: then that should be fine too 

62.70 64.14 A: yeah like 

64.46 69.81 A: um like i think [noise] like once in a while like doesn't like some company like 

69.99 73.08 A: they'll have their employee do like urine samples [noise] 

72.54 74.10 B: right i don't know um 

74.52 76.93 B: ah like um 

77.36 81.89 B: so- i think the law is that they have to be they can't be like unannounced 

81.69 92.87 B: unless unless the employee like agrees to it um like prior to being employed with them but ah i know like in the military they can do it whenever they want to when i was in the military they 

81.70 82.66 A: uh-huh 

92.94 96.20 B: just popped the test on you at any time 

96.03 97.08 A: oh really 

96.61 97.84 B: yeah 

97.20 110.70 A: i yeah i have a fr- ah i have friend who goes to the army and he says like sometimes the sargent or like some officer would just announce okay you and you we're gonna do like drug tests on you so they're like some some of them just get caught 

106.64 108.33 B: right right 

109.88 118.60 B: yeah [sigh] so yeah they keep people off drugs you know they keep a wor- a safe working environment and plus people will definitely be more productive in their 

118.98 120.86 B: (( you know in their job so )) 

120.97 135.80 A: true but at the same time like ah do you ah do you think like it's an invasion of privacy 'cause [noise] what sh- some say like what you do at work is one thing but what you do at at home is another thing you know like people wanna keep it separate 

135.39 138.60 B: well if you have drugs in your system when you're at work that's 

138.66 142.52 B: that's like a- affecting the job at that point i think 

142.15 143.25 A: mhm [noise] 

143.14 144.05 B: so 

144.60 147.38 B: it's just kind of a fine line you can draw there 

144.82 145.66 A: okay 

147.52 148.49 A: uh-huh 

147.91 151.44 B: as to like you know if you'd s- 

151.48 158.98 B: if you'd use drugs a certain amount of time before you go to work then of course you know i guess you won't be really affected by 'em but 

159.45 160.36 B: so 

159.63 161.65 A: mhm yeah that's true 

163.40 164.55 B: [sigh] so i guess 

163.74 165.45 A: yeah well huh 

165.04 171.06 B: i guess that's the kind of a tough one there but i would i would definitely be for it the 

170.84 176.12 A: yeah like what about like unannounced ones like if companies does unannounced ones 

176.07 182.69 B: testing right yeah if they did unannounced ones i'd think that would be even better to keep people more honest 

182.28 189.26 A: mhm because it- it's it's really hard to for them to just like do like announced ones huh 'cause they can like somehow they cheat on 

187.49 188.29 B: right 

189.08 196.36 B: yeah if you say i'm gonna do one on the fifteenth you could just make sure maybe four days before that that you don't do anything and then 

196.44 198.50 B: like the next day there you go [laughter] you 

198.97 199.97 A: (( it )) 

199.28 201.81 B: can do it w- as much as you want so 

202.06 211.08 A: yeah [mn] i think ah ah i think they just like if you do it an- announced then there's just like too many ways to for for like a loophole to occur you know like 

210.26 212.77 B: [noise] right take off work call in sick 

212.19 214.80 A: yeah it's it's just way too much hassle 

214.52 215.64 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

215.40 226.29 A: yeah and then like i also think like i- if like your your colleagues are doing drugs and then i dunno i just it's just the entire atmosphere that you're working under will be like pretty bad 

225.70 227.19 B: i think so too 

227.63 229.89 B: i definitely agree with you on that one 

230.01 238.63 A: yeah uh like do you have you heard like um like [noise] in your personal experience of like any kind of situation that this happened 

232.03 232.91 B: so 

238.15 245.10 B: (( [noise] yeah in the when i was in the military they ah people were getting caught like un- unannounced ah )) 

245.28 253.41 B: ah tests and they'd make up all kind of stories as to what happened like [sigh] it's just second hand smoke or something ridiculous 

253.44 258.56 B: and the policy in the military is that you know you get processed out of the military if you were caught 

258.79 262.75 A: oh like there's no like ah warning or anything assigned to it 

262.12 268.89 B: [noise] [noise] no it's like a called a zero tolerance policy they just automatically start to process you out of the military 

269.21 270.78 A: oh shoot 

271.02 273.89 A: like do you know what kind of punishment they get 

272.94 276.03 B: [noise] yeah usually they'll get like what's called like restriction 

276.38 283.43 B: they have to like stay on the base for thirty days and like sometimes they have to forfeit like half of their pay for a month 

283.69 286.43 B: then on top of that you get discharged [noise] yeah 

287.17 288.69 A: (( oh i see )) 

289.04 292.80 A: well that's pretty tough so then like the military's really strict about it huh 

291.85 297.77 B: [noise] oh yeah very very strict it's kind of a recent thing over the last ten to fif- fifteen years though 

297.82 303.79 B: it's it- it's become that strict 'cause earlier in the you know military history there 

297.89 298.82 A: why [noise] 

303.71 318.63 B: there was like a lot of drug use especially in the navy uh people be on board ships they would smoke weed and get really drunk and then people started dying because of accidents happening that's when they started really buckling down and getting tough [mn] 

318.88 321.25 A: oh like even for like weed and stuff 

320.88 322.28 B: yeah 

322.14 323.92 A: (( oh i see [noise] )) 

322.70 329.00 B: [mn] even alcohol if you if you like come to work drunk or you have a drunk driving accident 

329.07 334.21 B: or domestic abuse with alcohol involvement then that's like grounds to be thrown out too 

334.83 336.54 A: oh i see 

336.55 344.72 A: yeah 'cause all like all my friends used to like they described it like bruce lee what's i don't really know like the details about military how like how they operate [mn] 

344.80 345.79 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

345.21 347.54 A: (( lot of people are against drugs and stuff )) 

347.41 352.09 B: yeah it's pretty pretty strict policy didn't used to be that way though 

351.14 351.70 A: (( mm )) 

352.13 352.92 A: huh 

352.85 358.45 B: i said it didn't used to be that way though it just really it just really got really strict over part like that [laughter] 

357.31 359.35 A: look like why didn't they care before 

359.64 365.63 B: i think it was 'cause it just it's just an accepted thing that people were get- you know the drunken sailor kind of a um 

366.08 369.00 B: (( [sigh] you know stereotype that )) 

368.41 369.33 A: uh-huh 

368.92 383.78 B: military people just drink a lot and party a lot and people were more accepting of it until you know i guess the public got more aware of it and [sigh] people started dying or having accidents and then they started cracking down on it 

383.40 385.39 A: (( yeah i s- i see )) 

385.51 386.62 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

386.78 399.11 A: yeah like um in the me- i think in the media nowadays there's a re- there's like more like awareness as to drugs and stuff like even cigarettes like you know how they now they have like truth 

399.23 402.25 A: (( that stuff that's like a regular like )) 

399.37 402.96 B: oh yeah yeah i like those commercials those are pretty cool commercials 

402.82 409.94 A: yeah i think i think the public is now ah more of like aware of this uh health issue so that i think 

403.00 404.22 B: (( [sigh] [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

410.20 418.91 A: um like like do the drug like drug testing thing it's gonna be like more p- ah perm- like a- a- around you know what i'm saying 

418.23 420.37 B: yeah i agree 

419.89 427.89 A: like do you know how often like comp- or like what ki- what types of company like do all company have their employee like do drug testing 

427.54 432.62 B: i know that like [sigh] like um i'm in the medical profession and like when you um 

433.59 438.70 B: like most hospitals like before you can be employed there you have to do a drug screening 

438.49 449.08 B: but beyond that uh um most hospitals you don't have to have they don't do unannounced screenings or anything like that just an initial hiring thing so 

448.99 449.77 A: oh 

450.04 453.92 A: wh- when you do drugs do you do blood sample or just urine or both 

453.43 458.17 B: u- urine or it depends on what you're really testing for or you can ah 

458.26 463.74 B: test ah blood like for alcohol but you can get with urine you can test for all other drugs 

464.50 465.93 A: oh i see 

466.21 471.42 A: like i'm not sure like oh yeah this this reminds me like a couple a couple years ago 

471.05 471.99 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

471.82 482.28 A: like someone told me like um shoot like if your parents wanna check up on their kids whether or not they're doing drugs all they need to do is just have like a like like a hair 

482.16 487.19 A: and they just send it to like some company and they'll like drug tests on that do you know if that's true 

487.11 490.28 B: i've never heard of that i've been 

489.34 494.08 A: (( you never heard of that like ah let's see so )) 

490.48 491.32 B: (( mm mm )) 

494.42 499.94 A: be- like beyond the medical do you know any other like field that'll test drug testing 

498.84 500.31 B: [noise] any other what say 

500.31 501.87 A: any other field 

501.99 506.21 A: that does like drug tests beyond like the like your medically 

506.65 510.89 B: [sigh] yeah i know that any company they can ma- make you do a um 

510.96 519.79 B: a test um prior to being employed but be- i think like it may be illegal right now to do like an unannounced drug 

521.04 522.22 A: oh 

521.22 530.28 B: test unless you like specifically agreed to it yourself like before you're hired they can't like hire you and then say okay well 

526.83 527.84 A: oh 

530.50 534.36 B: our policy has changed and now we're gonna do unannounced um 

535.11 536.80 B: checks because 

536.81 543.57 B: like even the like if you watch ah the news at all you'll read like how these ah professional athletes are 

539.71 542.21 A: (( mhm )) 

543.71 545.58 B: being asked to ah 

546.25 547.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

546.86 549.51 B: submit themselves to unannounced drug tests 

549.52 550.47 A: uh-huh 

550.22 554.26 B: and a lot of them don't agree with it because they say it's an invasion of their privacy 

554.28 555.91 A: oh i see 

554.89 560.45 B: so they can't like make you do it as a as a ah unannounced thing but before you're 

560.81 562.39 B: hired they can 

562.49 564.00 B: (( they can make you do it [mn] )) 

564.05 568.61 A: so what about poli- ah what about like the police do you know if they can do unannounced 

568.17 569.73 B: (( [noise] hm that that is a )) 

568.64 570.16 A: (( do you have to like )) 

570.08 573.86 B: that i don't know you you mean as far as working on the police force 

573.78 575.76 A: yeah 'cause i i i've

584.12 585.29 A: yeah

591.81 594.56 A: ah set a date for it 

593.65 595.86 B: yeah that- that's a good question
