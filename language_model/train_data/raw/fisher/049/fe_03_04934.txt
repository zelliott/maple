4.23 6.02 A: hi kathleen my name's phil 

5.59 6.46 B: hi 

7.30 10.16 A: i guess the topic is family [mn] values and divorce 

10.05 11.49 B: (( uh yes )) 

13.82 17.13 A: well i mean you know you do get married for better or for worse 

17.70 20.78 B: if you so choose to get married i suppose 

20.89 22.11 A: yeah 

21.61 23.09 B: for some people 

23.76 28.54 B: there's a lot of divorce though so i think pe- people take it a little lightly 

25.62 26.56 A: there is 

28.78 34.76 A: no you know some people don't know exactly what they're doing don't forget somebody who gets married at the age of twenty one 

34.82 35.66 A: (( you know )) 

35.87 40.81 A: by the time they're twenty nine to thirty two they're probably you know working on their second marriage 

40.81 42.30 B: mhm 

42.05 45.07 A: so in some cases it's better to get married later than early 

44.91 53.14 B: i agree i agree i don't think people should get married until at least they're after twenty five actually [laughter] 

52.96 53.95 A: okay 

53.98 56.70 B: have some time to personally grow 

54.23 56.01 A: and i don't think uh

66.05 67.09 A: okay 

67.56 68.70 B: um 

70.02 76.71 B: i think a lot of people get married um because they're insecure they want to hold on to something or a relationship

80.46 81.78 A: you don't why 

81.69 82.56 B: um 

83.22 90.92 B: i just don't think it's necessary i think you can make a commitment without it being a legal commitment i think you can make a commitment to someone 

88.81 89.74 A: (( oh okay )) 

91.27 93.57 A: so you're just going to live with somebody 

91.39 92.07 B: and

259.97 263.87 B: they are m- might already think that that's how it'll be you know 

263.99 267.77 B: 'cause a lot of people that are dating they still you know date other people 

267.55 268.72 A: exactly 

267.95 272.30 B: uh without the their partner knowing and and things like that

479.50 488.21 B: right and sometimes [mn] kids can be better off depend- i mean if their parent is not going to be a loving parent or if their parent is going to be 

488.33 494.40 B: you know saying things to them that are gonna stick with them the [laughter] rest of their life that are inappropriate or things like that 

494.23 495.32 A: (( mhm ))

579.21 579.94 A: yeah 

581.20 587.54 A: oh i know a lot of people that go out to vegas and get married quickly they can also go out to marry go out to vegas to get married divorced 

583.81 584.85 B: mhm
