0.03 1.43 B: hi i'm john 

1.36 3.62 A: yeah i'm tom [laughter] 

3.79 5.22 B: (( how you doing )) 

4.42 5.93 A: (( good how are you )) 

5.81 7.49 B: i can't complain at all 

8.44 14.37 B: [noise] ah so the subject is censorship within public and private schools 

9.30 10.63 A: (( [noise] )) 

12.42 15.72 A: [noise] 

15.20 16.14 B: um 

15.84 18.16 A: hold on a second okay i gotcha 

16.91 19.15 B: (( yeah go ahead )) 

19.23 20.37 A: um 

20.96 26.31 A: i yeah well it what is it in pri- i didn't catch it really what is it 

25.47 33.86 B: that's fine it it's censorship in schools in public and private and whether they can choose what books can read and not read 

29.64 34.51 A: (( [noise] all )) 

37.20 38.08 A: right 

39.15 41.96 B: yeah not an easy not an easy answer 

40.62 41.79 A: there it is sorry 

41.89 43.29 A: i'm sorry 

42.42 44.13 B: [noise] not an easy answer 

44.34 46.25 A: now um 

46.45 49.76 A: i don't understand what the question is really are they saying 

49.58 51.52 B: you know could could a public 

49.82 54.74 A: if ah to to bring in yourself like if i wanted to bring a playboy in or something 

52.23 53.62 B: no i think 

54.31 62.57 B: well something like that i imagine it's it's more along the lines of you know can we forbid children from reading books written by a masked man 

63.05 64.47 B: or books 

63.74 65.39 A: a atheist or something 

65.13 75.15 B: right or for or even just you know graphically sexual or overtly violent or anything that might offend the school board that's what they're saying 

75.13 75.95 A: (( hm )) 

75.28 79.24 B: i mean it's done every day i don't know why it'd be any different now but 

78.60 80.78 A: right yeah 

79.49 80.82 B: i guess they just won- 

81.01 83.23 B: wonder what you think 

81.10 82.02 A: i guess 

82.50 86.30 A: i guess i guess what i think is if it's ah 

87.75 98.48 A: if there's ah [sigh] ah what i would say is it it's pretty much out of the question in a public school or a regular university on on a college basis but i what i think ah 

98.53 107.30 A: is probably the upper echelons some of the extremely privates schools probably are ah are for everything i would imagine there are schools out there that cost 

107.37 113.57 A: fifty sixty thousand dollars a year now probably easily i don't even know what they're up to but i would say that 

113.94 115.40 A: (( if )) 

116.16 118.87 A: if there's a majority 

118.77 132.25 A: um if if if a if a school only ah embodies or whatever if it only has you know four or five thousand people or even less maybe two or three or four thousand people i would say that ah 

132.28 136.41 A: if there's a majority vote then i mean wh- why 

136.83 138.97 A: why wouldn't it be allowed you know what i mean 

138.76 149.68 B: [noise] [noise] but i think that's the question then r- regard is could that s- skew what they're learning i mean if you reg- if you restrict what books they can and can't read how can they get an education 

149.30 150.97 A: right 

150.31 152.64 B: so i suppose that's the question i have 

152.67 156.39 A: yeah i would say that ah if they if they vote for it 

156.96 158.22 A: (( then ah )) 

158.55 161.68 A: you know they would have to because they're paying 

162.10 165.48 A: for those peop- they're paying their their ah 

166.24 169.49 A: you know their ah salaries so if the um 

168.34 169.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

170.55 178.12 A: the board would have to be i i'd say the board would have to be overridden but i mean i guess the board would o- override depending on prestige 

178.34 185.34 B: yeah well i suppose you're right [noise] i don't know i just can't imagine there's too much out there that would really need to be restricted i mean 

179.84 181.13 A: i i don't ah 

184.95 187.68 A: right that's [mn] that's what i think i mean 

187.83 188.75 A: (( whatever [mn] )) 

188.93 194.13 A: after nine one one [mn] and and all these crazy things that happen in the world i mean 

194.44 196.41 A: i'm not saying that ah 

197.25 202.34 A: you know there's [mn] there's things that i wish i never knew but ah 

202.77 205.24 A: i guess you're supposed to think that ah 

206.26 214.49 A: the more the better i guess you're supposed to think the the if the kids are know everything and are introduced to everything 

208.65 210.43 B: yeah 

215.10 221.41 A: and there's enough help psych- you know psychologically and ah 

221.41 224.50 B: i think that's a lot a lot 

221.88 222.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

222.59 227.46 A: yeah to fix the pro- you know 'cause it's i mean anybody's capable of anything [mn] mhm 

227.18 237.18 B: yeah but i think that's one of the thing that we're fighting with education here is the fact is that we're allowed to have a duality in our system that we can hold two thoughts at the same time 

237.16 246.27 B: and the people we fight against people that we're really fighting against is people who do censor books people who say no you can't learn this and no this isn't allowed i 

246.42 255.76 B: think the more that we restrict the closer we become to being fascists in ourselves by saying no don't learn this no this is illegal to own no don't have that thought process [noise] 

254.89 256.12 A: ((  )) 

256.51 259.40 B: (( so [noise] [noise] )) 

259.72 262.90 A: right as it is right it's scary it it's scary ah 

261.42 262.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

263.65 264.82 A: i was 

264.96 268.76 A: [mn] comparatively speaking i believe as as i've gotten older 

269.29 275.62 A: i'm thirty six i grew up in a plastic bubble i didn't know a lot of things that ah 

270.05 275.18 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

275.24 277.25 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

276.14 285.38 A: i've been introduced to lately now did i ever want to be introduced to those kinds of things if they're negative or i feel that they're negative i 

277.87 278.84 B: [noise] 

280.10 281.08 B: (( hm )) 

285.16 286.96 B: (( [noise] yeah i've )) 

285.37 298.31 A: think no but maybe the kids today are are smart enough more educated or or more stronger i guess the word is maybe they're stronger have stronger minds 

298.65 313.07 A: that if they're introduced to something negative or something that maybe some people think that they should never ever encounter or you wish they never encountered hopefully i'm i'm i'm i'm after all i'd go through every day anymore i would 

313.08 318.68 A: i'm i'm starting to believe that these kids are stronger than we are i was when i was a kid 

319.27 321.11 A: but i i i don't 

321.65 326.68 A: like to think of the weaker minded people because i i see them ah 

327.30 330.21 A: getting hurt by the the 

330.99 333.35 A: ah the harm that's out there today 

333.20 336.03 B: never really thought about it like that i can see your point though 

335.84 337.61 A: (( do you understand what i'm saying i mean )) 

336.11 337.03 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

338.16 344.15 A: i i don't like to [sigh] i don't like to feel like hitler and weed out the stupid people and feel like 

344.51 348.33 A: you know all the all the dumb people should die or be 

348.52 353.52 A: stepped on or anything like that but it seems like in today's society it's so competitive 

353.98 361.00 A: that they're really trying to weed out ah the weak minded and ah it could it could be hurt it hurts physically 

359.98 362.47 B: (( [noise] right )) 

363.39 377.43 B: right well i think that's one of the best reasons why you know for public school at the very least you never should censor what the children are thinking coming back to our point i mean i guess that's where you'll find the lower 

377.59 385.30 B: the lower class the middle class the students who are average the students who do need the most help and the most education can't imagine that really 

385.72 392.43 B: the nation and spending fifty thousand dollars for a student who isn't the best and the brightest of their generation 

391.93 393.62 A: mhm 

393.10 394.05 B: so 

393.79 395.86 A: it's interesting 'cause 

397.27 404.80 A: i don't know [sigh] [laughter] i feel as if some of the i'm i'm tending to believe that some of the upper echelon people 

399.04 400.04 B: yeah 

404.87 407.53 A: in society as i've gotten older are ah 

407.84 414.39 A: they they're i wouldn't say they're brainwashed but i think they're ah maybe pushed or ah 

414.43 418.06 B: i think the older you get the more set in your ways you get 

417.48 418.88 A: yeah 

418.25 429.93 B: and there's all those um [noise] there's a reason to protect the capital you have when you're older than than somebody who's younger who's open to more just because they have very little to protect 

424.09 425.11 A: yeah 

429.77 431.32 A: yeah it's 

430.79 431.92 B: (( [noise] so )) 

431.55 432.94 A: it's sad [mn] [noise] 

433.03 434.03 A: i 

433.04 433.78 B: yeah 

437.47 439.43 A: don't like to think that ah 

439.72 442.75 A: i'm never gonna change and never be more positive 

443.02 450.23 A: you know i i i always i always like to think that i'm gonna be able to break the bad habits that i [laughter] have 

449.96 451.32 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

450.27 455.36 A: and be more positive but i guess the fact of the matter is 

455.97 463.56 A: is that ah like it it's harder to break old habits than than to train new ones i think that's what people 

463.75 474.47 A: probably for a long time they've probably figured that they'd probably rather have a baby come into the world a new born and get rid of somebody that has bad habits 

465.74 466.61 B: [noise] 

467.70 469.26 B: [noise] 

474.29 475.60 B: yeah 

474.95 480.92 A: than ah try to break the oh you know the bad habits of the person i see that now as i've gotten older 

475.97 477.55 B: [noise] 

479.94 481.88 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

481.18 484.38 A: somebody that picks on somebody because they're short or 

484.46 486.97 A: they'll probably always pick on somebody 'cause they're short ah 

487.00 492.63 A: i was just you know hypothetically or if they have big feet you'll always pick on 'em because they have big feet 

488.41 489.76 B: [noise] of course 

493.28 496.31 A: ah i like to think positive i like to think that 

496.64 504.46 A: as you get older you learn more and you hopefully you get better but i guess like you were saying ah people are really ah stuck in their ways and stubborn and 

503.73 510.12 B: [noise] and i think the older they get the more they're stuck in their ways and the more conservative in nature they become and that's why 

510.34 514.13 B: looking at our you know the younger generation they look so much 

514.45 516.83 B: more prepared for the world than we are ah 

516.83 520.62 A: i think these kids are strong though am i wrong or how old are you 

520.35 522.28 B: i'm twenty eight so 

521.79 524.82 A: yeah ah you think these kids are stronger then we were 

524.62 534.26 B: [laughter] yeah i'm a graduate student and i've got kids who are five even six years younger than me and i'm constantly just amazed at how 

530.95 532.08 A: mentally 

534.30 535.47 A: sharp 

535.08 537.78 B: (( yeah just so [mn] [noise] )) 

536.02 539.16 A: yeah that's what it is they read right through you 

539.26 541.36 A: when when adults can't 

541.42 543.60 A: when middle aged people or 

544.21 547.38 A: sometimes they just read right through you and they just look at you 

548.08 553.53 A: like [laughter] it's just amazing i i'm 

553.70 561.83 A: even even babies are mesmerized by 'em just really impressed by 'em i guess that's probably why people are so 

562.14 565.33 A: hard on one another in the united states because 

565.60 566.81 A: they see how 

567.00 571.04 A: sharp and intelligent the kids are and they figure ah well 

569.99 573.03 B: well they're they're our hope too though 

571.80 577.35 A: yeah they figure well we might as well get rid of this one has bad habits 

577.10 578.16 B: yeah 

577.42 578.65 A: and then we'll 

578.97 585.48 A: we'll have you know a newborn take it's ah take its place or whatnot it's crazy to think that way but 

582.96 583.72 B: hm 

585.20 588.01 B: no i i think it's a i think it's genuine though 

586.69 588.61 A: everyone wants a better world right 

589.10 591.60 B: (( yeah we all do )) 

590.74 591.56 A: (( i guess )) 

593.21 594.66 A: scary 

594.48 596.33 B: but it is 

595.90 599.34 A: 'cause you wanna live i mean you have a will to live
