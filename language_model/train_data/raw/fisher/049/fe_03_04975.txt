8.52 11.23 B: well i just go for walks regularly 

10.70 12.15 A: that's me too 

11.93 14.12 B: yeah about forty five minutes every day 

13.80 15.09 A: do ya 

14.83 16.44 B: yeah 

15.40 19.37 A: yeah we usually walk around a coupla blocks around the house here 

18.69 20.36 B: yeah 

19.46 21.87 A: so i've had surgery and um 

22.55 29.21 A: i'm still not up to snuff so i can't really do much of an exercise regiment 

28.54 34.38 B: yeah i know this but at least this is something i mean uh i know that i used to weigh two fifty 

34.47 38.96 B: uh coupla years back and just by doing this you know every day 

38.90 40.66 A: right 

39.53 45.84 B: you know that helped uh that helped quite a bit uh just by just by walking during lunch 

45.81 55.15 A: [noise] that isn't bad [sigh] yeah [mn] well we walk at night because of the fact that you know when we get home my wife and i get home we have children at home 

46.89 48.77 B: yeah 

55.87 65.32 A: so we walk and that way we get time to be together without the children around and talk about things that need to be talked about 

61.74 62.97 B: (( mm oh yeah )) 

64.95 66.33 B: it definitely works 

66.88 72.11 A: [noise] [noise] but now do you want to get into another exercise program or 

72.24 80.36 B: i don't know not i don't know just yet right now i do side jobs plus i have a fulltime job at ni- uh- at night well third shift 

79.63 82.32 A: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

80.48 81.92 B: hm i don't know 

82.08 84.80 B: if i would i'd probably go back to martial arts i guess 

84.81 86.65 A: mhm 

86.04 88.72 B: but i haven't done that since high school 

88.22 90.71 A: (( you haven't huh )) 

89.10 89.88 B: no 

91.19 92.25 A: yeah i 

92.51 98.27 A: once i get better i'd like to get back into shape because i was down to two ten eighteen months ago 

98.98 101.76 A: and i'm back up to um 

102.72 114.75 A: well i was at two ten before i had an accident and um then now i'm about up to two forty and i went from two ten to one fifty up to two forty 

115.15 116.55 B: wow from two ten 

115.46 118.25 A: all in eighteen eighteen months 

117.91 120.93 B: wow that's incredible that's huge 

119.40 124.15 A: yeah that is a huge thing and i'd like to get back down you know 

124.32 125.60 A: low twos 

125.84 127.49 A: you know so i don't know 

128.30 131.60 A: i don't think i'll do much strenuous exercise 

131.39 133.69 B: mm definitely not 

132.01 134.66 A: um because you know um 

134.84 137.10 A: my body won't take it no more 

137.13 146.13 A: but i think i'll you know get into some kind of fitness i like to you know be in water and they have like water aerobics 

145.86 147.58 B: (( hm )) 

146.54 149.77 A: and things like at a rec center up by us so 

149.79 153.58 A: i would not mind you know getting into that 

153.94 155.30 A: and um 

155.71 162.26 A: because it's not as stressful as you know lifting weights or anything like that 

163.00 164.57 A: [sigh] so um 

164.62 167.24 A: that would probably work a little bit better 

167.14 172.97 B: that'd definitely help you i mean plus it's low impact i mean you'll be you know you'll feel a lot better afterwards 

172.56 176.08 A: oh yeah because you know walking now it's 

177.64 183.79 A: going up the hills are tough you know and they don't have much hills around here 

183.99 185.69 A: and also um 

186.81 187.99 A: the um 

188.55 199.22 A: going up the hills and uh just the walk itself even going down hills i get tired and you know i kn- i know it's my body taking the strain 

194.68 195.49 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

198.79 199.69 B: wow 

199.45 207.22 A: uh because i went through six surgeries so uh well i'm going through the sixth one in a week 

206.44 208.49 B: wow what happened 

207.54 214.15 A: uh i was in a car accident and everything was internal so i had a colest- er a 

215.05 219.38 A: splenectomy and i had holes multiple holes in my colon 

219.28 220.26 B: (( pshaw oh man )) 

220.17 222.58 A: so you know um 

223.17 227.79 A: yeah like i said i was down to one fifty and i looked real thin 

228.87 230.74 A: and horrible 

229.01 231.45 B: yeah yeah i believe it 

231.17 238.21 A: so everybody you know one seventy five two hundred would be a good weight to get back up to or down to 

237.90 239.58 B: mhm 

238.97 248.52 A: you know so some of the pills i take put weight on me and then being really inactive is um another thing i'm going in 

248.55 252.03 A: next week for a hernia operation it'll be my second one 

252.48 253.90 A: same place 

254.85 266.84 A: so you know low impact would be really good for me and i think i'll you know get back into something that's low impact but that will burn so- you know some of the fat off of me 

258.90 260.13 B: (( whew mm [noise] )) 

266.82 271.16 B: what about the mm and walking is that so so or 

266.96 267.90 A: you know 

271.27 279.13 A: walking i do well like i said i get tired and it's just you know my body hasn't done much for eighteen months 

271.89 273.58 B: yeah 

278.84 279.61 B: (( mm )) 

279.46 284.95 A: so you know it tires out but you know it's getting better 

285.54 286.52 A: um 

287.17 292.30 A: like i said we have a slight incline and we have a um foster daughter that i 

292.27 304.54 A: used to walk down to the school bus and come back home uh in the mornings before and uh walking down there you know i'd be okay i'd get tired because you know just the slant 

295.03 295.73 B: (( ah mhm )) 

304.40 314.38 A: but walking up i'd stop and take a breather you know just so my body could you know rest a little bit not much you know a minute or so 

314.79 316.43 A: but um 

316.58 320.33 A: you know that was about three four months right after surgery 

320.65 326.20 A: uh which was you know it was tough to get back into it and then you know 

326.38 331.83 A: walking like i said we walk at night so i try to hit the um 

333.11 336.78 A: the slant going down and try to get a smaller hill coming up 

337.26 343.57 A: you know more than i do the hill coming up you know as a rule so 

343.82 351.02 A: [sigh] which helps you know and i know i'm going to be back in the hospital for you know another coupla days so 

345.47 346.76 B: (( definitely )) 

351.22 364.49 A: and once i get my body back into shape you know that's when i'll start doing more and more uh you know the doctors just don't want you to do much because of the hernia pop being able to pop 

364.43 371.62 A: so they they tell me take it easy take it easy and all my friends you know oh let me do that let me do that it's like you know leave me alone 

371.84 374.26 A: i can still do some things 

373.00 375.34 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

374.65 380.75 A: so you know that's kinda tough too 'cause like [mn] we moved um 

380.91 385.77 A: around some stuff in the garage and everything and i noticed i got tired 

385.72 386.56 B: (( oh yeah mm )) 

386.43 387.56 A: so 

387.99 398.21 A: um you know like i said i want to get back into a better regiment and walking's good bicycling you know bicycling is kind of low impact 

398.31 400.65 A: so that'll help me out too [mn] 

400.53 405.17 B: the only thing is it's going to take time i mean it'll take you oh look around two years or so 

405.07 413.88 A: oh yeah yeah you know i just i don't want to get to past two hundred and forty i mean this is the biggest i've been shoot 

414.17 417.07 A: in twenty five years 

417.22 426.47 A: so you know i need to do something that i can get back you know and like you said yeah it's going to take a long time the doctor told me 

426.29 433.29 A: i probably won't be lifting heavy things anymore because it could re-injure my hernia all the time because i have such a 

432.38 434.53 B: (( mhm )) 

433.44 436.06 A: [sigh] thin wall lining now [sigh] 

436.69 442.72 A: but if i do low impacts you know that will help it and um 

443.72 448.18 A: you know sitting around the house doin' nothing you tend to eat more 

447.28 449.41 B: (( wow absolutely )) 

448.28 452.12 A: so i'm trying to break that habit already 

451.55 452.62 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

452.32 453.39 A: so 

453.86 457.31 A: anyway do you do anything else besides walking 

456.23 458.42 B: no it's pretty much it um 

458.51 463.76 B: i mean that that i just do a lot of it you know uh five days a week during lunch 

463.96 468.97 B: so instead of density i go for uh more time 

464.10 465.86 A: right 

468.33 470.13 A: right 

469.85 471.70 B: and higher frequency [noise] 

472.49 475.33 A: uh-huh how about hills and stuff 

474.62 478.79 B: nah i tell you there's uh where i walk where i walk there's a slight incline 

478.71 480.42 A: right 

478.81 487.29 B: but it's maybe uh maybe a quarter of a block and but once i'm over that everything else is pretty much flat 

482.93 484.66 A: right 

486.69 487.79 A: downhill 

487.90 490.88 A: do you do steps or anything like that 

489.36 496.60 B: yeah no not really no just uh it when i first started i did a fifteen minute walk 

491.38 492.13 A: no 

496.95 507.13 B: uh you know basically around the building and then a basically around uh a block i would work up to fifteen minutes of going around one of the blocks 

498.91 500.64 A: right 

507.45 513.54 B: eventually i worked up to forty five uh minutes going around another block 

513.14 514.22 A: (( right [mn] )) 

514.87 518.52 B: but but it took time to build up to it 

515.89 516.64 A: that's 

517.54 519.52 A: yeah yeah that's 

519.54 521.25 A: you know i'm ready to go 

521.28 524.70 A: you know and that's the frustrating part of it is 

521.44 522.09 B: (( mm )) 

525.06 527.14 A: you know i do have to slow down 

527.05 528.11 B: (( hm )) 

527.86 533.88 A: 'cause i'm always active so i think i'll just do more fishing this year though 

533.83 535.07 B: (( [laughter] )) 

534.98 539.67 A: you know work up the arm muscles so i 

537.37 538.34 B: (( mhm [laughter] yeah )) 

540.20 545.14 A: learned how to fly fish and walk through the water there that's low impact 

544.30 545.41 B: (( oh that's true mm )) 

545.42 547.35 A: walk upstream 

547.98 555.39 A: but yeah i you know i'm like i said i'm going to do low impact and try to get back into shape again 

555.41 558.18 A: 'cause i have no muscle tone anymore 

559.43 562.97 A: which and i mean i used to carry three hundred pounds of beer 

563.65 566.27 A: all the time so 

566.57 570.40 A: you know constant twenty thirty times into a store 

570.74 574.07 A: and do about thirty stores so 

575.00 580.69 A: it's tough to you know go from that much activity to uh nothing 

581.65 583.57 B: [laughter] mm and then try and pick up again 

582.15 582.94 A: so 

583.40 584.27 A: huh 

583.91 585.61 B: and then try and pick up again 

585.33 592.75 A: yeah yeah well you you know it's like i'm ready i'm ready i'm ready and your body says no you're not ready 

586.99 587.35 B: (( mhm )) 

593.00 599.89 A: you know we're going to sit here for a little bit longer and uh we're going to re-heal better and you
