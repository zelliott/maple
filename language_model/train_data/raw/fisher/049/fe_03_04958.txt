0.83 2.37 B: hello this is mark 

2.17 4.13 A: hi my name is john 

4.06 5.13 B: john hi 

4.89 6.14 A: hi how are you 

5.92 7.32 B: i'm good thank you 

7.00 8.43 A: good 

7.94 10.58 B: i guess this is is this your first time or 

10.01 11.81 A: ah yes it is actually 

10.90 13.19 B: okay this is my third time so 

12.59 13.95 A: oh okay 

13.39 15.09 B: we gotta talk ten minutes 

14.68 15.81 A: yeah 

15.17 19.07 B: yeah and then the recording comes on and tells you when it's time so 

18.68 19.94 A: oh okay 

19.83 21.13 B: so um 

22.31 24.73 B: well i guess the what the question was ah 

24.83 26.03 B: do you think the 

26.16 32.87 B: schools have a right to prohibit ah students from reading certain types of publications or books i guess is that the way you understood it 

32.36 33.87 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

33.99 39.47 A: yeah ah either that or ah had the right to dictate what they should 

39.67 40.58 A: (( ah )) 

40.93 43.87 A: was it they should read or or should not read 

43.86 48.80 B: well i understood it that that ah you know it's a censorship theme and that ah 

48.83 54.74 B: they have how do you feel about st- ah schools prohibiting students from reading certain types of books that's 

55.37 59.37 B: i think it's pretty much the sa- i guess the same thing as you were saying so yeah [mn] 

57.93 59.38 A: yeah um 

59.75 63.05 A: [mn] boy that's a tough one um [mn] 

63.30 66.35 A: (( i [mn] [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

66.92 76.33 A: i don't i don't think they should really you know ah ah it it's a free country you know i think ah kids should have a right to read what they want um 

77.19 88.65 A: now i can see them you know asking them not to do it during class or you know you know something of that nature but you know if it's in their study hall or or during their free time um 

89.05 97.92 A: you know that's america that that's ah you know freedom there that they i think they should be able to read you know [mn] ah what they want at their leisure 

98.51 108.43 B: yeah i i guess i pretty much agree with that i ah you know i guess there's certain types of books you know pornography things like that that probably should not be allowed in in school and 

106.81 110.73 A: yeah yeah i guess there's always limitations there [laughter] 

109.78 112.18 B: but ah you know when comes to i guess reading 

112.38 118.55 B: you know if there are references to things such as ah you know r- different types of r- religious orientations ah ah 

118.62 123.34 B: and evolution things of that nature i you know i think that that should be 

123.39 125.99 B: there shouldn't be any prohibitions on things like that so 

125.72 127.72 A: no no yeah 

126.81 128.52 B: so but um 

128.93 138.45 B: i guess i'm not aware that ah lots of school i guess that there are some schools that do ah i just not to ware ah aware of that that that is an issue in schools where they do prohibit but i guess 

138.71 147.70 A: yeah um yeah i i well i went to a public school and ah i ah some friends of mine actually ah my cousin's ah 

138.78 139.66 B: i guess 

147.71 154.70 A: ah two daughters ah they started out in in in private school ah it was a parochial school but ah 

153.53 154.55 B: mhm 

154.91 159.03 A: ah they're in public now but i i never heard of them ah 

159.26 162.67 A: you know not being able to read certain things um hm 

162.92 177.20 B: yeah i guess it you know ah i guess that i thinking back i have heard about that in some areas where you know some parents have gotten really upset about certain types of publications and a and wanted the prohibition on that i i don't know i ah 

174.03 175.36 A: yeah 

177.27 182.56 B: i have a i don't know of those i don't know i haven't lived in an area where that's happened and i 

182.77 188.40 B: i don't think there was any kind of prohibitions on on material when i was in school and and um 

189.24 192.08 B: none of my friends ah that i'm aware of have 

192.60 195.09 B: have been exposed to that but ah 

195.35 205.05 B: so but i agree with you i don't think that ah you know i think it is a ah it's a free country and plus you know the diversity stimulates the mind too you know and 

203.57 205.16 A: sure sure 

205.64 211.96 B: ah so again outside of certain certain things that may be really overtly promote violence or 

211.96 220.79 B: or are real discrimination or or pornographic or something i can see you know those you know those there might be concerns there but 

217.78 219.48 A: yeah yeah 

220.11 232.39 A: i i gu- now that you bring up the you know you you had mentioned the pornography that that kind of ah you know [mn] makes me think well there is always you know two sides to every story and ah 

231.77 233.38 B: ah yeah yeah 

232.52 240.08 A: you know i can see where you know someone's wanting to bring in pornography to that definitely shouldn't ah you know especially um 

241.41 255.69 A: in the younger aged kids you know they're just more you know they're more curious they're more ah you know the they're easily influenced and and ah you know well i i guess anything and and and in k. through twelve probably 

255.72 258.33 A: ah shouldn't be allowed to do that ah 

258.21 270.74 B: yeah yeah oh i agree i ah i mean i'm i'm a i'm a real proponent of you know strong personal freedoms and and ha but we do live in a society and i guess there's just certain things you know where i mean if they're gonna 

265.95 266.84 A: yeah 

270.63 280.30 B: advocate violence things like that where it does have to be control you know and as you say some younger kids can be heavily influenced by these things so but um 

274.27 276.08 A: right 

277.07 278.16 A: sure 

281.37 292.09 B: certainly ah i guess and of course the question was directed at schools so i i don't about the university level that's a school and and i ah i think the restrictions would be a lot 

287.30 288.49 A: yeah 

292.15 293.37 B: a lot less 

293.43 294.98 B: at that level so 

294.63 304.03 A: right right yeah 'cause i think there's a certain maturity level there that ah you know you know ah tho- those students can handle it and ah 

297.98 298.55 B: (( [noise] )) 

304.83 306.96 A: are you there oh okay 

305.10 308.58 B: [noise] [noise] yes i am yeah i just had some- someone pull up to the door 

308.23 310.54 A: oh i see um 

308.96 310.13 B: (( yeah )) 

311.07 320.20 A: [lipsmack] yeah you know at the college level um yeah i can think back when i was in school that ah i don't think i ever seen ah you know anyone 

320.49 324.41 A: blatantly ah looking at pornography or anything like that but ah 

324.44 335.90 A: you know i i'm always a a very observant person and you know [mn] i always try to see you know curiosity ah gets the best of me and try to see what people's reading and and ah 

335.98 343.75 A: you know if it was a textbook or a magazine what kind of magazine they was reading or you know what what sections of the newspaper they was looking at 

340.27 341.14 B: yeah 

343.02 344.79 B: yeah 

344.26 345.08 A: (( and ah )) 

345.54 349.53 B: well i think that's wise to be be observant like that and and ah 

349.69 356.21 B: you know i have kids in school and and ah i ah i'm not even concerned about the type of material they're reading 'cause 

356.51 357.50 B: um 

357.82 360.16 B: i mean as as far what's official 

360.18 363.07 B: official schoolbooks or anything that doesn't concern me i know 

362.72 363.85 A: yeah 

363.13 372.75 B: what would concern again is what they might be reading on the side you know but ah i think the schools do a do a pretty pretty fair job of that yeah so yeah yeah you know something that would ah ah 

365.74 367.62 A: right right 

372.10 374.29 A: yeah i think so i think so 

374.39 375.24 A: they 

374.51 375.79 B: (( you know advocate )) 

376.21 376.83 A: (( ah [mn] )) 

376.24 377.70 B: ((  )) 

376.86 381.27 A: yeah i i guess ah my viewpoint would be ah you know 

379.85 380.75 B: (( or you know )) 

381.31 391.21 A: might as well let 'em read what they want you know that's ah within reason um probably the only limitation i would think would ah would be the pornography or 

385.19 386.38 B: ((  )) 

390.41 391.22 B: (( that )) 

397.24 398.05 A: (( or )) 

400.91 407.87 B: yeah yeah so i think it's ah also very good to encourage reading too i mean it's ah it's ah i mean sometimes 

405.16 406.82 A: sure sure 

407.88 411.37 B: there's some lot of kids who don't get into that and and ah um 

410.03 411.67 A: mhm 

411.91 413.46 B: but ah again i 

413.99 428.33 B: [mn] think variety is kind of the spice of life and so it's good it's good to be exposed to different different ways of doing business and and ah thought process and things like that so [noise] um particularly in the country we grew up in you 

422.03 423.38 A: mhm 

428.36 429.69 A: yeah 

428.74 434.60 B: know it's ah it's there and i've done a lot of travelling overseas where ah you know 

434.76 449.05 B: cultures are a little ah in countries were a little bit more mono culture i guess for lack of better words where there isn't as much variety and and ah i think that's one of the good things here is that we're we're exposed to a lot of different things and and 

441.56 442.33 A: (( ha )) 

448.99 461.23 B: ah um a little off the i guess it relates to books too you know i that's why ah it's ah i think the the more the more they're exposed to in books the more opportunities diversity of having books the better so so 

460.60 466.33 A: mhm oh sure and you know the more they the more they read they more they learn um 

464.95 466.12 B: yeah 

466.59 478.82 A: you know 'cause even in fiction um you know sometimes there there can be some some truth there and and some you know things you can learn and little tidbits ah about history and and things of that nature 

478.30 480.13 B: [mn] yeah yeah 

479.12 481.15 A: that the author can throw in there 

480.67 483.35 B: yeah yeah i am of course um 

483.71 492.63 B: i'm a i guess i wouldn't believe too much in teachers who have you know extremely strong views on a particular subject or something trying to run trying to promote 

492.65 495.37 B: certain certain certain books i mean i think 

495.49 504.02 B: books that are i guess read in schools should be port a pretty much part of the general curriculum or something and supported and not so much a you know just on a 

500.22 502.58 A: sure sure yeah 

504.11 509.10 B: a major objective or an opinion of a particular teacher so 

509.97 521.73 A: [cough] yeah yeah i think ah that [mn] i think a teacher'd really have to ah you know weigh that decision heavily before before choosing a a a book for for the course 

510.16 511.31 B: (( but ah )) 

521.77 523.25 A: ah what it would be 

523.45 527.86 A: um 'cause it seems like you'd wanna kind of have something that ah 

527.97 536.56 A: you know or if you have one ah very strong ah opinionated on the one side that you know needs to assign something that that may be 

536.63 540.68 A: ah strongly opinionated on the on the opposite from that or 

540.08 546.38 B: right right right yeah yeah and of course there's there are a number 

540.76 541.95 A: (( or ah yeah yeah )) 

546.95 553.88 B: of parents out there too that have very strong opinions and i guess that's where some of the issues arise to as were 

553.96 564.48 B: some cases where parents or groups of parents are concerned about ah the types of books or a book or something or a theme that might it's being taught in a class and 

563.77 565.29 A: mhm 

564.49 565.69 B: and ah 

566.28 570.27 B: but i don't know like i said i have kids in school and they've never 

570.49 575.23 B: never really been concerned about that as being an issue so and ah 

575.53 578.09 B: (( but i know there's there are parents who are and and ah )) 

577.72 580.27 A: (( yeah )) 

579.64 584.00 B: very strong strong willed parents i guess very opinionated and like you know 

584.14 585.46 B: are concerned about 

585.76 588.79 B: certain themes being taught in a certain way i guess so 

588.16 590.32 A: mhm mhm 

589.17 590.27 B: (( but um o._h. )) 

590.64 591.96 A: yeah i've ah 

591.97 594.52 A: i've something to look forward to i have a ah i 

594.81 599.95 A: have a ah nine month old here so [laughter] yeah than- 

596.84 597.70 B: well 

598.18 599.89 B: congratulations so
