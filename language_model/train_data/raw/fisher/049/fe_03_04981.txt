0.46 2.01 B: hi jake 

1.61 3.34 A: hi my name is aron 

3.31 4.71 B: (( how're ya are )) 

4.19 4.96 A: good 

5.17 6.84 B: you an exerciser 

5.31 6.02 A: (( how )) 

7.46 14.40 A: well a little bit [laughter] now and then um just for actually this year at christmas time we bought a uh 

14.65 16.28 A: um a treadmill 

16.31 17.27 B: uh-huh 

16.39 27.13 A: and i've been exercising on it regularly but i pulled my hamstring so i haven't [laughter] been able to do much lately but it's the first time in a long time that i ever exercised in any way that was 

21.83 22.90 B: yeah 

27.29 28.70 A: i guess organized 

28.46 29.45 B: uh-huh 

28.85 30.93 A: how about yourself [noise] 

29.97 33.02 B: yeah i i got a uh treadmill 

33.06 34.17 B: uh 

34.60 47.61 B: got a deal on one i i guess a year or so ago a chain up here was going under and so i i always played with the idea of putting one downstairs and watch the news or something and 

47.05 48.26 A: (( [noise] right )) 

47.67 48.84 B: uh 

48.62 54.26 A: yeah i mean the thing with me is i i i don't know how other people i don't know how you are but i've always found like 

54.61 69.48 A: i like exercising if i'm playing a game if i'm not it's something that's kind of i don't know not necessarily torturous but real unpleasant for me and it's it's really hard for was hard for me to be able to [sigh] i guess motivate myself to do uh 

63.39 64.74 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

69.49 80.42 A: something i don't like if it was also taking up time and at least by getting the treadmill it's something i could do while i was sitting in front of the t._v. or you know running in front of the t._v. 

80.27 89.84 A: [laughter] i didn't feel like i was wasting time that i might have been used doing something else at home so i i guess that was sort of a good compromise for me [laughter] 

86.71 88.35 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah that )) 

89.81 102.38 B: yes it is uh [noise] you know it's easier said than done and you know you say you try to promise yourself and but you know it doesn't always work out that way and uh [noise] 

103.34 105.63 B: i you know i try to do 

105.89 111.24 B: you know either the six the six thirty news or the six thirty to seven but it doesn't you know 

111.18 122.94 B: just just everyday life gets in the way sometimes and you know then you end up skipping and then the next day you say ah you know it's it's tough to get into a a routine 

113.80 115.19 A: (( [noise] sure )) 

123.16 125.62 B: uh [mn] daily [noise] 

124.79 136.17 A: [mn] i was doing pretty well until i hurt my leg and i i'm going to start up again now that i'm starting to feel better but i was i was trying to do three times a week which i i figured was enough to 

136.08 140.56 A: keep me going i mean i live a pretty li- healthy lifestyle other than that so it's 

140.77 149.90 B: [noise] yeah i was trying to knowing that that is all i do for exercise which is not enough to uh hang your hat on or whatever 

140.93 142.76 A: a step in the right direction 

148.50 150.38 A: (( [laughter] [noise] right )) 

149.75 160.61 B: i tried to uh you know we all start off gung ho and whatever and i was doing almost every day you know i didn't think a half an hour was uh too much to ask 

151.42 152.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

160.96 173.50 B: uh but you know like everything else some days you just don't want to and some days you push yourself and say yeah i gotta do it and other days uh 

173.70 175.46 B: you know you do it or 

175.66 184.05 B: you know in the weekend it's a little easier 'cause you're not working or whatever so you can schedule your time a little bit better and you know 

183.81 184.99 A: sure 

184.45 188.40 B: sometimes you cheat and you don't put the full half an hour [laughter] in and 

188.44 191.24 A: yeah i've been pretty good about that um 

188.45 189.52 B: (( uh [noise] )) 

191.35 200.72 A: i i i have more trouble getting motivated to start something than i do to finish it once i get started i'm pretty good [laughter] about completing what i set out to do i guess 

200.42 203.07 B: yeah the motivation is uh i 

202.14 202.70 A: (( [mn] )) 

203.48 213.66 B: my biggest drawback uh but you know the it's something that you know it the more you read and the more you see on t._v. and 

213.80 223.58 B: everywhere else you almost feel like you know i feel bad that i'm not you know i can't even do a half an hour treadmill when they're telling us that we should be doing a lot more than that 

223.01 224.34 A: right 

223.70 225.47 B: and uh 

225.53 232.21 B: you know somewhat feel guilty and then the wife gets on your case what did we buy that thing for and 

231.81 234.74 A: well that's another motivation to you that i guess [laughter] 

234.44 235.51 B: yeah 

234.87 237.88 A: to justify having paid for it in the first place 

237.27 238.74 B: yeah yeah 

237.95 250.74 A: i think that's why people get themselves uh memberships to the y. or the gym is then they figure well if they don't go they'll feel like their money has been wasted so it gives them the motivation [laughter] to do something they might not have done otherwise [noise] 

250.13 255.50 B: yeah and then uh you know i did that i tried that five six years ago and the 

255.47 267.18 B: you know the twenty nine dollars a month and uh i think i ended up figuring i i didn't go more than i did go and you know the winter was the worst part 

267.16 273.04 B: uh because i didn't want to get in the car to go there or at the end of the day or tired and you know 

269.16 270.09 A: right 

273.14 282.73 B: you know i got uh and now i gotta go to the gym or whatever so i gave i didn't to be honest i didn't give that a fair shake either that was two or three months and then 

279.91 281.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

283.09 294.90 B: i think you talk into yourself into or at least i do a lot more and yeah yeah yeah you know by the time i buy this treadmill and uh you know it's ten months' payments uh 

295.10 311.08 B: you know that kind of thing equals if i put it down stairs i'll save money in the long run and it's easier and that's been the drawback because i didn't want to go anywheres else and you know i talked myself somewhat into it yeah it's only going to be downstairs this'll be easy and 

300.44 301.33 A: right 

310.65 317.62 A: probably the only worry i have about it now at this point is that at some point [noise] it wears out [noise] you know 

317.82 329.52 A: the uh the uh [noise] um i guess the belt yeah has to be replaced and uh you know we got talked into buying a service agreement so which means that we'll be able to [noise] to fix it but um 

320.24 321.85 B: the belts and the motors 

329.63 337.98 A: with something like that usually that's a motivator just stop doing it altogether rather than bother to get fixed just kind of give up [laughter] so i guess the 

336.52 338.85 B: yeah and then it sits in the corner 

337.99 340.44 A: service agreement was a good thing i hope so 

339.94 351.41 B: yeah well yeah that that's true too but you know it's just i don't have the time to do uh any sport and i don't really you know when you get older 

350.32 356.39 A: [noise] see i would love to do a sport but the way it works especially since i live somewhere that isn't where i grew up and i don't know 

356.33 365.39 A: a whole lot of people because in order to join a softball team or a basketball team or something you have to know a bunch of people who start the start the team and then 

365.28 375.82 A: once you get on the team you have to hang out wherever your sponsor is you know go to the bar after the game or whatever like that it's a lot more than just playing a game so it's not as simple as i would have liked [noise] 

375.60 378.28 B: yeah and again you know the 

378.23 388.68 B: the the winter kills me 'cause uh you know they they have pick up basketball games but at seven thirty and you know i don't want to drive over to the high school and 

388.61 402.30 B: and now i gotta take a shower before i get out of there and go out in the cold and it's nine now by the time you get home or ten and uh you know it's the younger crowd and they're going to have a coupla beers and uh 

391.62 393.24 A: [noise] right [laughter] 

402.45 406.77 B: you know i i can't even play full court anymore [laughter] 

402.76 403.76 A: (( [mn] i )) 

405.94 418.83 A: i think that probably is [laughter] sort of indicative of a lot of things not just related to people's health but a lot of things that we mean to do but we don't do because all of the other outside annoyances get in the way of it 

418.24 419.99 B: yeah and uh 

420.74 434.46 B: you know it it it's you know everybody knows it's easy to talk yourself out of it doesn't take much to you know i'm going to do it tomorrow and promise yourself and yeah gung ho and then 

431.07 431.98 A: right 

434.52 436.76 B: something pops up tomorrow 

437.07 445.52 B: uh but you know again it's one of those things i know i should be doing more of but um 

445.76 449.67 B: like you said it's just hard to to get motivated and uh 

449.28 461.52 A: i guess it's a little easier for people who live someplace like central california where not too hot to get you know in the summer they don't feel like i don't want to go outside 'cause it's too hot and in the winter they don't worry about being cold so 

453.94 456.23 B: [noise] yeah exactly 

461.60 466.34 A: they can kind of keep on track or something like that or at least having that excuse 

464.38 469.86 B: and i mowed the lawn today so i talked myself into well that's my exercise for today yeah 

468.80 477.64 A: yeah that's what i say every saturday [laughter] same thing i actually bought myself one of those old push mowers 'cause i have a real small lawn and i figured if 

470.36 471.85 B: [laughter] 

477.71 486.94 A: not just because i don't like to deal with the gas and the noise and the smell and everything i figure at least it's more exercise to use that than it is to use [laughter] one of the gas powered ones 

486.70 488.96 B: yeah yeah and uh 

488.99 497.63 B: like i said it it i get trapped into that thing that you end up talking yourself or rationalizing it somehow in your brain 

497.66 504.67 B: that uh you know well that was enough for today and you know i did exercise and uh 

505.07 508.59 B: then you go and uh you know eat some co- uh 

509.09 513.35 B: cholesterol filled or [laughter] some uh 

511.35 515.14 A: [noise] oh right yeah and you undid all that you did [laughter] 

514.06 516.34 B: something yeah that's going to uh 

516.48 520.09 B: it's going to kill your arteries as it is anyway so 

520.65 525.13 B: uh you know you just so it's constantly something you know and then you 

525.25 532.42 B: you know walking is supposed to be great just you know just uh if you took a walk around the block or something but [noise] 

530.25 531.05 A: (( yeah )) 

531.77 535.63 A: well i do a lot of that i guess the only thing that's not as 

535.82 540.83 A: as good for you about that is it doesn't get the heart rate up 'cause it's not an aerobic exercise but 

540.63 553.68 A: i mean i'm lucky i chose to live someplace where you can walk to everything and you don't i mean i need to use my car to get back and forth to work but really there's virtually nothing else i need to use it for so it's really nice 

545.38 546.75 B: yeah that [mn] 

553.77 555.45 B: then you uh 

555.60 557.53 B: you know you try to uh 

557.62 571.79 B: [noise] like you were saying that california boy i've thought of that many a times it would just be yeah again here you are talking yourself into it but you would think there'd be a ton of things to do out there uh just walk the beach or uh 

568.41 569.54 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

571.96 576.48 B: you know you you think that there's uh well volleyball i don't know about that [noise] 

576.49 585.31 A: oh i mean i think probably as much of it has to do with the personality of the person uh probably out there people could come out with excuses not to do something if they really don't want to either so 

586.05 594.46 B: yeah and plus like you said before uh a lot of it is the crowd you hang out with um if your you know if your friends are exercis- 

592.57 596.92 A: sure if you know guys who are doing a softball team then you can be part of it yeah 

596.17 599.89 B: yeah or if your friends are just golfers or or
