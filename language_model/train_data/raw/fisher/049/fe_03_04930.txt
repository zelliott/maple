0.06 1.28 A: scott 

0.21 2.11 B: hello hi 

1.53 2.93 A: [laughter] hi i'm scott 

2.71 4.47 B: hi i'm jackie how are you 

3.98 5.48 A: i'm doing good 

4.85 6.45 B: that's good where you from 

6.15 7.48 A: uh new jersey 

7.18 9.72 B: oh a n- a neighbor new york 

9.43 10.85 A: right 

10.53 13.84 B: well how do you feel about the topic on divorce rates 

13.48 15.18 A: um well 

15.59 18.66 A: i believe that it's it's kind of like showing 

18.69 27.65 A: the downfall of american society really like it shows that we're not willing to commit or that we're too willing to commit 

21.53 22.35 B: that's 

27.74 28.90 A: either one 

30.27 34.31 B: yeah i think that um society has changed a great deal because um 

34.40 39.16 B: i'm not that old and um i'm divorced already and um 

37.58 40.39 A: mhm 

39.27 46.58 B: the the the values and respect in marriage is not the same as it was like when our parents you know were coming along 

46.02 47.74 A: right 

46.61 47.68 B: um 

47.89 54.86 B: nowadays people are are quicker to get a divorce [mn] just [mn] as much as they're quicker to 

55.20 58.83 B: go outside the marriage and do other things they have no business doing 

58.76 68.07 B: so like the marriage thing is like um it wouldn't discourage me to get married but in a way i will say it would because you going to be sceptical 

67.95 74.15 B: people are not as dedicated and loyal everyone's out to get something nowadays it's a dog eat dog world 

73.72 77.06 A: absolutely 

74.48 83.86 B: it's not like um you know the picket fence and you find the woman or the man of your dreams and life goes on the kids go to college you retire 

83.81 90.21 B: and live off the nest egg it doesn't have that now it's like what do you have 

89.57 91.38 A: yeah 

90.76 93.37 B: that's the way i i i honestly see it 

93.31 97.76 B: um as far as people being afraid to marry again 

97.63 105.80 B: i i doubt that very seriously no one is afraid to get married again unless you really were truly madly in love with the person 

105.67 109.18 B: that you're scared to get hurt that's that's just my opinion 

108.98 120.89 B: i i don't think no one in this world in this modern day in time is so madly in love because if you look at society now a lot of people especially movie stars my god they get married like everytime you turn around you know they don't even care to them to me 

117.36 119.34 A: [laughter] 

119.89 121.63 A: yeah 

120.77 130.67 B: it's a it's a it's a it's a money thing you get married [mn] like like my um dad always made a comment he said um instead of what did he say he said instead of getting a divorce 

122.49 123.82 A: mhm 

130.90 139.20 B: i forgot how the thing goes he says but it's so funny he goes just find somebody that's find a woman you don't like and buy her a house that's what my father said [laughter] 

136.93 140.24 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

139.41 146.98 B: that's what my dad says he says just find a woman you don't like and buy her a house and that's his point of view as far as marrying a second time 

140.35 142.36 A: (( [laughter] [mn] [laughter] )) 

147.40 150.55 B: [laughter] as you as you see value has changed 

150.67 152.51 A: oh definitely 

151.77 153.50 B: yeah what is your opinion mhm 

153.67 154.70 A: um 

155.02 161.63 A: i i feel that the values are just going down i f- i definitely feel that like our parents generation of 

161.47 170.11 A: they grew up with a different set of morals and a different set of like responsibility pretty much like i think that a [mn] i 

170.05 178.15 A: think that a lot of couples in our parents generation stayed together even if they weren't getting along if if only for the children 

178.07 179.28 B: exactly 

178.64 189.43 A: and i think now they're just the parents are being a little bit more selfish maybe and maybe maybe it's not so much selfishness maybe it's just that they just feel that they're 

189.54 193.57 A: they're just better off without their couple without their partner or other 

193.66 196.51 A: and that they're just getting a divorce instead of maybe 

196.56 200.95 A: not saying that they're not trying to work it out but maybe making it work out some way 

201.18 205.49 B: yeah and it's like society plays a part of it they have so many 

205.48 217.67 B: rules that we bend now and and lost respect um for instance i met this guy yesterday on the train right and it was so funny we just got into a weird conversation you know those type of people you meet and nice talking to you 

211.59 212.94 A: mhm 

217.68 224.62 B: but anyway he had mentioned to me that um he had a friend that was a married to a woman that wanted her girlfriend 

224.99 236.57 B: d- do you know 'cause she was bisexual to live with him and he was asking me you know how did i feel about that and i say wow i said that's just too much that's a bit much you know and and he was saying how um 

227.38 228.34 A: mhm 

237.30 241.05 B: you know they they all three stayed together for five years so far 

240.93 242.02 A: (( wow )) 

241.07 248.76 B: and i and i and i'm like this is this is so unique and different because years ago that was like a taboo now it's like now 

247.02 248.78 A: yeah 

248.58 257.77 B: you know people can actually marry and that because before it's supposed to be bigamy to be married and have someone else you know so now it's like okay um versus 

253.72 255.31 A: mhm 

257.59 265.15 B: you know you can have a regular marriage and if one of you decide to be bi you could have [mn] the other partner come along and live with you i mean 

265.39 274.63 B: that's some sick stuff there [laughter] you know and [mn] you know this is not on jerry springer this is like reality i actually met someone that we got in conversation when the train broke down yesterday 

266.45 269.44 A: [laughter] 

271.11 272.87 A: right 

274.65 283.99 B: and he told me this i was like wow you know like like it stayed in my head so it's so funny like today we having this conversation about that talk about morals huh 

281.84 283.76 A: yeah 

283.99 285.68 A: [laughter] 

284.39 286.04 B: have you ever heard of such 

286.32 294.23 A: yeah well i've never heard of anything like that but i have heard of you know like the mormons or the i guess it's the mormons 

294.82 303.80 A: they have um i think they can have up to three wives i think it's it's within their religion and i think it's legal in the state of utah 

298.58 299.69 B: really 

304.00 305.87 A: if i'm not mistaken 

305.43 306.98 B: (( what are they called )) 

306.71 311.03 A: i think they're the mormons they're a relig- a religious sect 

308.18 309.43 B: the mormons 

311.70 323.99 A: that migrated they started around around north east united states around our area and they migrated to utah which was supposed to be their promised land or their their holy land or whatever 

316.94 317.83 B: (( oh god mhm )) 

320.73 321.78 B: [laughter] 

324.11 331.77 A: and um yeah in in their written bible which [laughter] has scientifically and historically been proven wrong [laughter] 

331.96 333.03 A: um 

333.27 336.97 A: it it grants legality for 

337.46 338.47 A: um 

338.52 339.48 A: whatever 

339.53 341.40 A: binometry or whatever it is 

341.04 342.05 B: mhm 

342.32 346.39 A: and um they have it's not uncommon for them to have two or three wives 

346.60 349.77 A: and like all the children are just under the same house 

349.72 358.17 B: oh my god they have stuff like that on those talk shows a lot too about men who have a hundred wives per se what about um 

352.71 354.56 A: yeah 

358.46 368.34 B: [cough] i mean as far as values there's no values no more in in marriage i mean as far as i'm concerned from what i've seen and and dealt with um 

363.36 364.19 A: (( mm )) 

368.35 371.35 B: people have lost respect of relationships 

371.33 381.11 B: um i mean look look [mn] the widespread of diseases and if they turn round they have signs all over the train and buses about go get yourself checked and that tells you how what's going on 

374.63 376.30 A: (( well )) 

381.01 387.74 B: whether you like it or not i- if if you have a a mate you better hope that you know it's just you and that person 

388.04 401.24 B: you know it's it's not like before where people go to college and they graduate and and you marry that person of your dreams and call it a day now people are shacking up and everything and well we don't to have get married we're doing all of this stuff you know and then they have like what they call 

397.21 399.90 A: (( mhm )) 

401.17 407.52 B: cohabitants you're legally married if you live with someone for five years so it's it has lost a sense 

408.00 410.02 A: right 

408.10 410.74 B: the paperwork has changed a great deal 

410.93 423.76 B: or you get like the um marriages where they have to fight like cats and dogs and you know who gets what and it's sad because i've read some interesting stories because i read a lot and that's where i see all this stuff um how this woman
