13.26 14.21 B: yes 

18.26 19.14 B: okay 

19.20 27.70 B: now they fin- i i i skipped last night i said let me hear what tonight's topic was when they said exercise i said i'll do it just to get it done with 

27.30 30.23 A: [laughter] oh you're doing three total 

28.17 28.97 B: so 

29.88 30.73 B: yes 

30.31 32.34 A: that's what y- yeah that's what i'm supposed to be 

31.50 35.79 B: and that's this'll be it and this one i can i can deal with this one this 

35.17 38.26 A: oh yeah i can deal with this one too you wanna go first or you want me to go 

36.39 37.49 B: (( exercise )) 

38.40 39.85 B: (( you can go first )) 

39.28 40.92 A: okay um 

40.95 55.47 A: i do exercise although i haven't uh exercised for a a couple of weeks it's just been pretty busy but i um basically just do stairmaster um i've got one in my basement and i 

55.83 66.14 A: do that probably when i'm doing it regularly especially in the winter i'll probably do it about four maybe five nights a week for forty to forty five minutes 

66.14 79.45 A: and um it seems a little bit odd my wife thinks it's odd but i um also play guitar while i do the stairmaster 'cause otherwise i probably wouldn't have enough time to do either of 'em and um 

79.63 87.01 A: so i i just get up there and kind of get warmed up and then grab my guitar and just sit there and practice different songs so 

86.71 87.61 B: mhm 

86.96 97.27 A: that's pretty much all i do i do golf a little bit sometimes i walk most of the time i ride during work and uh that's i don't know that's probably it for the routine stuff anyways 

96.83 97.62 B: (( mm )) 

97.99 100.98 B: well basically my exercise is uh 

101.04 103.98 B: i i i'm disabled so i walk with crutches 

103.69 104.56 A: okay 

104.05 105.15 B: um 

105.26 109.81 B: and i'm kind of overweight so it is very hard to do exercise 

109.80 115.97 B: it's it's hard to get motivated to do exercises by yourself so but basically the exercise i 

115.85 122.58 B: [cough] like i just that i do is walking when i go to work um i used to exercise a lot when i had s- when i had a um 

122.45 131.92 B: [lipsmack] some friends around who who would help me go to the gym and just do exercise there i do enjoy exercise i just need to be motivated um 

132.20 140.21 B: 'cause it's not the easiest thing to do to lose weight so [laughter] and the only way to really lose weight is obviously is to work out and uh exercise wise 

139.99 140.95 A: sure 

140.48 142.08 B: just not uh 

142.60 157.19 B: i just haven't done it i haven't done it in a while i have to get back into it eventually [sigh] i think i will once i find the right uh the right person who's willing to go with me like three days a week or one day a week even because come to my house and uh 

157.58 161.77 B: just watch me do pushups situps things like that uh 

160.73 163.00 A: you said you walk with crutches and uh 

162.11 167.47 B: yes i do i have a disability so it's in that sense it's it's really healthy 

163.88 164.66 A: (( okay )) 

167.69 169.37 B: to do exercises 

169.51 173.26 B: uh like i say i have to be motivated and i need to be pushed 

173.40 177.87 B: to do it um i am lazy sometimes no question 

177.49 178.71 A: [laughter] 

177.99 182.17 B: but i do like to do exercise just like i say i need to be motivated so uh 

182.59 185.67 B: sooner or later i will get back around to uh 

186.16 188.10 B: (( do it i haven't done exercises in in )) 

188.36 190.51 B: quite a long time um 

191.11 199.48 B: when i go see the doctor he goes well why aren't you exercising 'cause i'm lazy i need to be motivated so well i'm looking for things out there 

199.61 200.92 B: to uh 

201.20 204.71 B: well i'm looking for people out there to help me uh do exercise 

204.97 207.37 B: and to go to a gym is is uh 

207.40 210.09 B: [lipsmack] not hard but it's ex- expensive 

209.97 211.26 A: mhm 

210.67 213.90 B: so that that's the only reason that i don't go to a gym because 

213.95 216.05 B: money's an issue in the long run 

216.07 217.27 A: right 

216.63 217.63 B: um 

217.96 221.72 B: when you only make so much per week and you gotta pay bills off and uh 

222.03 226.56 B: you have no money left over to go to a gym then [laughter] then you gotta little problem here so 

226.64 234.07 B: i try to figure a way how to like i said to do it at home and i do i have little weights at home i like dumbbells i do at home 

234.24 236.35 B: i play with those once in a while 

237.21 238.09 B: so 

238.40 243.32 B: (( sooner like i said sooner or later i will get back into it i- if i find something ou there too )) 

243.19 244.26 A: yeah 

243.64 247.68 B: um i play a lot i used to play a lot of wheelchair sports too 

247.75 255.03 B: which is ex- good exercise too so and i'll find it sooner or later s- something out there for me so 

249.81 250.72 A: sure 

254.71 257.58 A: yeah my wife um does some 

255.21 256.00 B: (( so )) 

257.50 262.66 A: lifting of uh weights in the basement sometimes she's she's pretty small 

262.44 263.25 B: mhm 

262.57 273.06 A: and um she likes to just be real healthy and uh but i i'm i'm kinda big too and i i don't uh don't really feel the need to use 

266.16 267.07 B: yeah 

273.02 282.45 A: weights like that to bulk up so i i just uh try to do the cardio stuff just to keep the heart going and and i'm i'm with you i'm lazy i it 

274.90 275.70 B: mm 

282.43 293.67 A: it maybe isn't a good excuse but it's the best excuse [laughter] and um i find myself finding as many excuses as i can i mean i you know it's 

285.66 286.89 B: exactly 

293.64 306.82 A: be come home after work and i'll say well the girls um our daughters and one of 'em has to do this and so then it drags on and i i won't exercise if it gets too late 'cause i don't like getting real hot and then going to bed so 

306.23 307.32 B: mhm 

306.74 312.82 A: and it just seems to take me a long time to cool down so if if i don't start by eight or something i don't do it so 

312.77 320.84 A: if something's going on oh it's eight fifteen well i can't do it tonight it's past my time [laughter] come up with any possible thing you can but i 

317.44 318.28 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

320.78 326.31 A: i i it is hard to get motivated which is why i started um 

323.11 324.76 B: (( mhm )) 

325.36 326.06 B: (( mm )) 

326.12 340.53 A: when i first started stairmaster and i'd just sit in front of the t._v. which is okay but um one time my guitar happened to be within harm arm's reach and i grabbed it and started playing and it and it gets harder when you're when it when you're kind of working out pretty hard but 

334.89 335.70 B: (( mm )) 

340.41 352.90 A: for the most part it's not too bad and um it is another thing to get you motivated to get down there and and play a little bit and i've seen people come in and they say oh how do you do that and i'm thinking well if you ever watch any of those 

345.51 346.32 B: yeah 

352.69 360.37 A: crazy bands on t._v. i mean those guys are running around jumping around probably worse than what i'm doing just sitting here going up and down these steps so 

360.04 361.05 B: mhm 

360.47 361.74 A: it's um 

361.99 364.38 A: you know it's it's not too 

364.76 372.02 A: u- un- unruly as far as coordination but uh it passes the time a lot quicker than just standing there that's for sure 

367.68 368.33 B: (( no )) 

371.78 372.97 B: yeah 

377.39 389.64 B: uh [sigh] that's basically it um this usually happens see we was like two or three minutes left into left into this it's con- yeah when when that when that time comes i usually think what else does what else 

383.85 385.14 A: oh yeah 

389.57 392.97 B: is there to say usually getting out to like five five or six minutes 

393.05 396.29 B: and then the last three or four minutes is the hardest part of this whole thing 

395.23 399.31 A: i i'm actually can't see a clock can you uh do you know how long we've been on 

397.96 398.74 B: (( ye- )) 

398.91 401.55 B: yeah we've been on for like uh seven minutes 

401.25 404.27 A: oh really it actually goes kinda quick [laughter] 

401.86 403.10 B: (( yeah so we like )) 

403.46 413.42 B: yeah sometimes it goes quick it depends like i said it depends on the subject like for me when y- when they said exercise i said ooh that's good last night's uh topic was uh 

414.33 415.48 B: um 

417.37 421.18 B: what's the word i was looking what are they what was it last night

422.95 426.05 B: [lipsmack] and i was just i i couldn't deal with that [laughter] 

425.64 428.84 A: no what did you do just hang up before the other person got on 

426.30 427.09 B: no 

428.00 433.15 B: well they say if you don't wanna if you don't wanna you don't wanna to take this call press this button so
