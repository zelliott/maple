135.43 136.57 B: yeah 

135.98 147.33 A: i think the older ones might've done too i think that one did but that one's kind of an old one they just bought it over at a at the restorers so some of it's not full fully functioning but i you do use it it does work that way 

146.98 147.94 B: yeah 

148.15 152.33 B: um i do think it's important from all the stuff i read um 

152.69 167.67 B: ah the more overweight you are the more likely you are to get cancer the more likely you are to get diabetes um the more likely you are to have high blood pressure so i think of all that stuff the health benefits there okay i need all of this going for me 

168.08 169.11 A: (( [laughter] )) 

169.15 171.87 A: i i got diabetes and i do get ah 

171.97 173.66 A: high blood pressure 

173.79 176.99 B: so does it help you when you exercise

202.55 203.57 B: okay

244.22 246.24 A: yeah salt and sugars yeah 

246.38 248.74 A: and it says ah you're supposed to ah 

248.82 256.22 A: proteins and vegetables but stay away from fruits and carbohydrates and 

256.42 257.83 A: stuff like that 

258.18 259.11 B: all right

277.73 280.00 A: (( yeah that's what the problems is on that )) 

280.86 285.66 B: well i could understand with the apples and the oranges and things like that 

285.94 287.00 A: yeah 

286.41 288.04 B: yeah okay 

288.79 293.78 B: [mn] it what about things like um tomatos and cucumbers 

293.59 300.20 A: well i i think i think the water products are good because i think oranges would be good because they have a lot of water in you know 

299.27 301.01 B: (( and oh )) 

300.22 303.53 A: and tomatos would be good too but i don't you know i 

304.70 307.29 A: don't know the bigger the tomato is 

305.30 306.62 B: yeah my mother 

306.76 311.80 B: yeah my mother in law has it but i think hers is because she's um 

311.91 317.70 B: very overweight that's why she developed it although she says that's not the reason 

318.26 331.51 B: um but i've read and you know it says that if you're overweight then you have a tendency to develop the type that she has and she doesn't watch what she eats she goes ahead and eats whatever 

331.32 333.62 A: and she she she has type two or type one 

333.70 335.29 B: isn't it type two 

335.25 336.35 A: yeah 

335.77 337.41 B: yeah that's what i thought 

337.13 340.41 A: i have a friend that has it too but he's real thin you know 

340.62 342.64 A: maybe he has type one i don't know 

342.64 344.70 B: so do you have type one or type two 

344.36 345.39 A: type two 

345.05 350.74 B: type two that's what she has i'm pretty sure it's type two do you give yourself insulin 

350.82 354.47 A: no i don't think type two gets takes it just type one does 

351.28 352.49 B: no that's 

354.09 358.82 B: yeah all right that's what it is she has type two but she has to check it 

359.09 360.13 A: (( yeah i do )) 

359.83 365.32 B: and i've heard her talk about um eating a baked potato has sends it sky high 

365.99 367.58 A: it could yeah 

367.15 373.22 B: so she tries to um not eat those or eat just a small portion of it 

373.00 374.02 A: uh-huh 

373.98 376.29 B: but she won't exercise either 

376.31 377.27 A: she won't 

376.79 377.54 B: no 

377.84 384.34 B: [cough] and i think the exercise would like help her if she would go do that i think it would help 

384.27 392.23 A: yeah like i have problems with it you know the ah the s- sugar level you know with my body doing funny things and then i exercise it it throws it off 

392.44 394.03 B: does it bring it down 

393.74 395.75 A: yeah it brings it down throws it off 

395.96 397.04 B: okay 

396.70 400.54 A: (( so it you know it's i mean you r bo- [mn] it equalizes your body )) 

400.13 405.55 B: yeah well she won't do that she says she can't walk that it hurts her to walk 

405.46 413.25 A: well she can buy a a machine that [mn] ah at sears it's called a cardio fit or something like where you're sitting down and doing it and i have one of those 

413.58 420.68 B: um i don't i can't see her doing it they got something like that they've got some kind of a bicycle that you ride 

420.45 421.41 A: uh-huh 

420.91 422.89 B: stationary and 

423.02 428.30 B: and that i don't know it has all sorts of things on it but i don't think she does it at all 

429.82 431.77 B: but i just think it would help 

431.83 435.30 B: ah she's just sort of hard headed and she won't listen about it 

435.35 436.63 B: and um 

438.07 441.81 B: she tends to make fun of me and all of my walking 

441.73 454.98 B: and she also um if we go out to eat with 'em ah they will both her and her husband both will give me a hard time like if i don't eat all of my food like maybe i'll eat half of it and say oh i need a doggie box for the rest 

454.99 458.36 B: and i'll i'll save it for the next day and eat it for lunch 

458.47 462.50 B: but ah she doesn't believe in that she believes in cleaning your plate 

462.80 469.52 B: and she goes ahead and eats it all and she's very overweight and i'm like okay can't you see the benefits here of 

469.59 471.04 B: some of this 

472.68 476.92 B: just because they give you a large portion in a restaurant doesn't mean you have to eat it and 

477.14 483.12 B: she ha- she's retired she has all this time she has a great place to walk but she will not go do it 

483.74 485.49 B: she doesn't like it at 

487.81 491.63 A: well have you maybe if she ate stayed with proteins and vegetables maybe she could lose weight 

492.55 499.77 A: or a protein mix you can buy at the health food store you know it and have that to start out in and for breakfast and then i mean and then 

499.93 500.89 A: you know 

500.58 503.29 B: all so you're talking like a protein drink 

503.36 508.57 A: yeah you it's like a shake or something you know you put water with it and put it in the um 

509.32 511.28 A: blender or whatever and 

511.42 513.50 A: mix it up and drink it 

513.08 515.44 B: and what does that do for the diabetes 

515.32 518.47 A: well it does your something with your blood sugars probably too 

518.22 519.53 B: (( oh )) 

519.09 521.36 A: so that's what good about that 

521.70 528.99 A: and and and exercise you know for ah release energy too then exercise for maybe like half an hour on a machine or whatever 

528.76 533.06 B: okay i might mention that to her because i'm not familiar with those 

529.53 530.61 A: or so 

535.25 539.07 B: so any particular brand that you think's really great 

539.68 544.41 A: (( [mn] ah i got some downstairs you want me to go downstairs )) 

543.52 550.61 B: oh no no you don't have to do that but just tell her to go like to a health food stores and look at the protein drinks 

549.96 554.20 A: yeah ah ah the kind that don't the kind that has no preservatives and stuff in it 

553.93 555.12 B: okay 

554.47 556.26 A: that's the best kind for you 

557.19 560.10 A: the kind that has preservatives or any of that stuff in it 

559.85 566.08 B: okay okay i'll mention that to her it may who knows it might be something that she would do 

566.36 575.39 A: yeah plus also the body these days the bodies are l- are lacking i found out vitamin b. six twelve and folic acid are good too to get 

576.16 579.33 A: and you can get that ah at the health food store or something 

579.48 583.39 A: b. six especially for people that are anemic b six twelve and folic acid 

588.99 597.28 B: uh-huh okay well i assume we both agree that the exercise really important and it's really good for you if we could just all stay motivated to do it 

597.05 599.89 A: yeah i got a brain injury so it's hard for me to do that
