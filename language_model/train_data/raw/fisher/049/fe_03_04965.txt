105.85 106.84 A: (( [mn] ah )) 

106.98 109.96 A: (( ah in what sense like ah )) 

110.01 114.97 A: of course they do if ah they are part of my curriculum 

115.67 118.57 B: right so they decide on the curriculum 

118.00 120.25 A: well um ah 

120.69 126.84 A: the professors yes um mostly they decide on the curriculum at the same 

123.08 123.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

127.45 131.88 A: ah when the semester is over you know we have to 

131.80 137.93 A: ah give ah evaluation they're we're given evaluation sheets and before that ah 

136.42 137.58 B: (( mhm [noise] mm )) 

137.76 141.96 A: there is a kind of ah discussion and ah we 

140.48 141.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

141.76 143.71 A: we are free to 

143.64 145.14 A: offer to say if 

144.22 145.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

145.10 159.34 A: we like ah the textbooks we are using or if some of them have to be replaced and ususally the professors ah listen to our recommendations i have noticed this is my third year and ah 

150.98 151.57 B: [noise] 

157.44 158.59 B: mhm 

159.13 168.64 A: i just ah i keep in touch with the other students who are who study after me and ah they say that yeah usually if ah 

168.78 179.49 A: [mn] students find the books ah boring ah professors they usually take ah their comments into account well probably not all of them but [laughter] as a rule 

175.10 175.95 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

178.25 181.96 B: [laughter] yeah [noise] so what is your major 

182.16 184.93 A: (( ah it's ah public affairs )) 

184.65 185.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

185.23 194.09 A: i have a masters in linguistics from my home country but i decided to change my career so [laughter] i'm back to school 

194.09 196.39 B: (( yeah [laughter] that's very interesting [noise] )) 

194.36 197.25 A: i'm graduating this year actually 

196.93 198.16 B: oh great 

198.90 202.75 B: (( [noise] yeah i'm ah i'm in in linguistics [noise] when um )) 

202.87 210.21 B: as soon as you have to to to deal with with language or with literature [noise] in a ah ah ah further ah sense 

210.26 211.12 B: um 

211.64 220.23 B: i think it can make totally sense that a a a language teacher decides what kind of literature to read to make ah ah ah a good example 

220.71 229.83 A: well yeah that's true in my home back in my home country somehow we couldn't influence you know [laughter] our 

228.13 229.63 B: [laughter] right 

229.59 238.14 A: professors just whatever they decide well i was much younger at the time also i was younger than twenty and ah so 

238.49 250.78 A: um i they did they didn't even ask us if we liked our textbooks or not well no sometimes yeah we could ah make our comments but normally you know 

239.60 240.93 B: [noise] 

250.73 257.98 A: th- the ch- although the choice was big but ah the professors were um 

258.68 261.02 A: they they were to decide 

260.34 260.99 B: (( mm )) 

261.20 264.67 A: which textbooks to use unlike here 

264.64 270.90 B: so you think that's okay you think that's okay that they just decide or should they discuss it 

264.69 266.85 A: here students have sorry 

269.47 276.70 A: well no no i don't think ah that's okay especially if ah 

276.79 290.01 A: you know well well it depends what field you are in if it's ah something narrow like i don't know physics probably or mathematics um maybe but again i'm not fa- 

280.85 281.62 B: [noise] 

283.65 284.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

284.42 285.54 B: (( mhm )) 

290.10 300.51 A: very well familiar with that field i think that the the narrower the field ah probably the less is limit in to the choice but in public affairs you know we have 

300.51 308.02 A: a huge amount of literature and so of it is very theoretical and ah so i think that students ah 

305.75 306.83 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

307.91 316.25 A: must ah have ah sh- well should have should ah the right to make their comments and ah to 

314.86 316.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

316.27 328.42 A: recommend especially given the fact that in my program for example the average years of ah students is like ah i think twenty five twenty six years old meaning that ah 

321.25 322.02 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

328.31 336.93 A: ah most of them have had some ah ah you know working experience before that so they know what they they're mo- sorry 

334.15 336.07 B: yeah i think that's a great point 

336.67 343.82 B: that that's that's a that's a very good point the age of the student say if if the student is much younger say fifteen or something 

339.11 339.87 A: yeah 

340.25 341.07 A: yeah 

343.62 352.24 B: ah ah [noise] it's it's more likely that the professor [noise] can can decide ah what that student should read and and what would be good for the education of the student 

352.05 359.78 B: and and later ah ah the student has some experience [noise] by himself [noise] and and ah maybe should should take some of the control [noise] 

359.66 363.53 A: yeah that's true ah wh- what about y- what is your field 

363.43 369.51 B: ah i i'm actually a chemist yeah um [laughter] uh-oh 

365.63 367.15 A: (( oh uh-oh )) 

368.42 373.87 A: [laughter] i don't [mn] know much about this field [laughter] 

369.62 370.74 B: (( yes )) 

373.40 383.45 B: that's all right you don't have to [laughter] no and i i work in molecular biology now and and so my field is is very very narrow at the moment so i'm doing 

375.45 376.35 A: [laughter] 

382.59 383.73 A: (( yeah )) 

383.62 386.53 B: which is is a very small ah ah um 

386.61 395.15 B: ah ah a slice [noise] really from from the big cake and um however we have the choice between many different textbooks and um 

395.51 409.86 B: it's really worth a discussion of which one is is better and and and it's sometimes really difficult to decide and and it depends what you want whether you want the theory or want more the practical aspects and whether you want your students to understand what 

403.81 404.98 A: well in 

409.67 415.25 B: what is it is about in in a more general way and then so um but the choice is very tough 

415.78 425.53 A: yeah well that's true but [mn] yeah right and in in my case now especially you know with the ah expansion of internet as students you know 

425.66 428.90 A: can themselves ah check ah the 

428.79 442.59 A: ah the field they are interested in and ah they can check themselves they can find themselves the you know books ah ah that may be much more suitable for them than the professor's offer 

434.18 435.03 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

442.27 443.33 B: right 

443.47 450.79 B: but but say for an english student ah um i think the professor should be able to force the student to read say shakespeare 

452.66 453.98 A: to to read what 

453.70 462.24 B: shakespeare or something like that julius ah caesar by shakespeare ah um does [mn] as um ah not textbook but but literature 

455.44 456.42 A: oh 

462.46 472.87 B: so if a student would study english or or whatever comparative literature or something like that [noise] ah um the professor should be able to decide on which book is to be read 

473.94 479.87 B: so that the entire class reads the same book and then they can discuss ah close to the text and do some close reading 

474.08 475.69 A: yeah well yeah 

479.86 484.84 A: yeah that's ah i i absolutely agree with you that's right and 

481.48 482.36 B: [noise] 

483.40 491.30 B: in in in the sciences it's so different because it it's [noise] more about the facts and and not about who wrote it down and so you can can 

486.43 487.51 A: yeah and 

491.27 499.95 B: the professor might may decide that [noise] ah the students should learn this and that the facts but not from which to source to get it 

499.80 508.08 A: right and even more you know in a well th- the system our system was much more different like ah in linguistics we used to 

505.50 506.84 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

507.89 517.43 A: ah oh memorize ah sometimes the the whole passages from you know classics the classics we read and ah i have never 

514.84 516.13 B: right 

517.27 527.50 A: had ah something like that here in the states [laughter] well but i find it you know i find it a very useful practice because ah sometimes you know in ah 

520.86 521.94 B: [laughter] 

527.39 534.77 A: like in a conversation i i just don't have to ah i feel i don't have to think about ah 

534.70 546.23 A: this or that phrase i have that i have it in my like ah memory ah ready you know i can just easily derive it from as in the context 

540.30 542.04 B: (( right )) 

545.94 547.90 B: that's actually a good thing yeah 

548.16 552.38 B: probably very convenient to just there are certain [noise] certain things you just know 

552.17 559.15 A: yeah well and besides it it you know trains your your brain your memory ah which is a good thing too 

557.25 558.45 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

559.36 561.02 B: (( yeah i agree ah i think )) 

561.19 568.21 B: learning things by heart is not necessarily a bad thing i i learned a lot of poems as a school boy ah um 

567.43 568.88 A: yeah 

568.28 579.21 B: in back in germany that's a long time ago but i still know a lot of these poems by heart and ah um [noise] it's helped trained my memory a lot and and i just enjoy that knowledge [laughter] that's that 

578.11 589.72 A: yeah that's true you know and here i find that's ah ah not many students here learn like i we have to sons you know they go to school here and they don't learn 

583.95 584.61 B: [noise] 

589.32 590.02 B: (( [noise] )) 

589.73 592.20 A: ah any poems here [laughter] 

591.48 595.39 B: [noise] yeah but that's that's strange actually so um 

593.98 599.89 A: yeah which is kind of alarming i don't know ah especially poetry i i think that they should at least 

596.25 597.50 B: (( yeah ))
