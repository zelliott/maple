11.12 12.40 A: okay 

13.49 16.44 A: yeah how do you feel about uh 

16.76 18.58 A: company testing 

18.61 20.88 A: employees for drugs [laughter] 

20.34 30.39 B: [sigh] [sigh] um i don't think it's an invasion of privacy i think they have the right to test people um to see if they're doing drugs or not because it can affect their ability to do their job well 

30.06 33.57 A: yeah it's funny because ah 

33.83 44.44 A: i work ah for the school board you know where i work and i they just you know they wouldn't normally check people for drugs 

36.75 38.41 B: [noise] mhm [noise] 

44.07 45.35 B: yeah 

44.66 48.84 A: and i just took a test [laughter] not long ago 

46.92 47.97 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

49.08 57.08 A: and this is you know this topic uh and while i was in school too i think we did something like that about drugs 

56.79 57.84 B: uh-huh 

57.11 65.97 A: you know do you think if it's an invasion of privacy why and i think ah usually i heard the saying you know people 

66.21 69.81 A: who have nothing to hide hide nothing you know 

69.27 70.70 B: yeah so 

70.23 75.45 A: so if you know you don't do drugs i don't think you'll have any problem for 

75.66 80.69 A: the you know the and your employers to test you for drugs 

81.11 88.59 A: uh for me i am i am you know uh i more or less i am kind of more in a neutral person on that 

88.07 89.80 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

89.18 93.70 A: because i don't think i am against it and y- y- y- you know i- 

93.67 104.95 A: the only thing is inconvenient probably you know for you to go to a doctor or whatever to do that or to a place but i i don't think it's something that i would [mn] 

104.83 119.00 A: go against you know like i am not no exactly against it so i just i would calling a neutral part if there is any reason yourself you think you would be ah for or against it 

110.00 110.81 B: (( [noise] )) 

118.17 121.09 B: [mn] [sigh] well if i was working in a warehouse 

120.56 121.58 A: (( mhm )) 

120.96 134.73 B: and they didn't test for drugs i'd be worried because the person that's working with me he he can do something [sigh] um he can be drunk or taking drugs and he can do something that that um probably like hurt me like if if he what if he's driving a forklift 

122.65 123.39 A: (( yes )) 

134.26 135.32 A: (( uh-huh )) 

134.92 142.40 B: or or something like that so i i would think that [sigh] um to me i think it's good that they test for drugs 'cause like you say i don't have anything to hide 

141.97 143.23 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

142.44 146.41 B: [sigh] so i don't think anyone should get mad about it about that 

145.24 156.06 A: (( yeah and uh and even you know old situations too even in every company like even if you're working in the school system you know )) 

155.22 157.15 B: (( mhm yeah [noise] )) 

156.17 166.38 A: you want people to be [mn] like have a clear mind when they working with kids or as you said if you're working in the warehouse 

165.91 167.17 B: yeah 

166.49 168.46 A: (( like if that person like )) 

168.38 184.11 A: you know are not responsible and they come in the morning and you know thinks eh i could just have a little drugs eh eh that's nothing you know i am used to it or people who drink all the time and say well i've become immune 

184.12 185.32 A: (( to it you know )) 

185.46 193.39 A: if i drink two if i drink three that's no problem and these people they are fooling themselves and it's too bad 

191.51 193.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

193.45 200.42 A: usually they cause problem to other people not to themselves [laughter] you know [mn] ye- 

198.67 206.78 B: yeah like like you said in the school setting you know that's causing problem with eve- you know with people's children you don't want them to see anything like that [mn] 

201.09 202.40 A: yeah 

206.13 214.74 A: yeah you want your kids to be like when you send your kids in the morning you want mm them to have some people responsible uh 

206.85 207.41 B: (( [mn] )) 

214.79 215.46 A: (( uh )) 

215.38 229.85 A: oh even though sometimes the parents they are not really eh exampl- you know em er um a model you know for their kids but at least if you are responsible for the kids during the daytime [noise] 

221.65 222.86 B: yeah 

230.03 241.77 A: in the most critical time you know when they are awake and they are fa- you know they follow you and they trust you they listen to what you say and everything 

241.77 251.59 A: you're supposed to have a clear mind about what you're saying or what you're doing doing drugs i don't think that would be something 

252.10 256.97 A: you know i think at least if you know the company has the right to 

252.28 253.96 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

257.37 265.10 A: test you from time to time i think that'll keep you on your toes and maybe that will probably even save your own life [laughter] you know 

264.17 266.01 B: yeah 

265.30 273.44 A: because sometimes you can be saying i am doing a little a little like this and then you go you go you go before you know it you 

273.45 280.98 A: go overboard and you can even overdose yourself and and we've heard a lot of people who die like this 

276.32 276.88 B: (( [mn] )) 

280.86 282.28 B: yeah 

281.39 291.68 A: eh which is not a good idea and when you you try to help these people and they think well it's my life you know well if it's your life 

291.85 295.34 A: you don't need to work for the company [laughter] [noise] 

294.29 305.83 B: yeah and if you feel it's an invasion of privacy if you find out one of the uh the um one of the requirements is to take a drug test then it's your right not to um uh uh apply for that company 

305.75 318.65 A: ye- yeah i would think and then i think now more or less i think most companies even even for the entrance even they don't do it when um check you know uh 

306.28 307.51 B: yeah so 

307.79 308.47 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

314.55 316.02 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

318.88 322.40 A: even for the entrance i think maybe before they 

322.86 329.98 A: get you like you know ah before they hire you i think they have some type of drug 

325.69 327.30 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

330.24 340.21 A: test going on whether it's blood whether it's you know your [mn] specimen whatever they take you know they have some type of drug test going on 

340.00 341.38 B: yeah 

340.49 345.47 A: (( [noise] and which i think it's frankly it's very you know )) 

346.00 357.12 A: it's good because the person like you like we- we're all saying you know we're enshrined government like you know skyrocketing anyway 

356.78 358.00 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

357.41 363.38 A: (( and if that person hurt him or herself on the job they're gonna sue )) 

363.25 364.59 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

363.75 375.97 A: and if they don't have you know if they do all these things while you didn't check it and they don't think you're gonna do anything about that or even you know test them randomly or everything 

375.91 382.35 A: they're gonna hurt themselves they will fall and whatever happened then the company is responsible 

382.43 383.76 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

382.53 389.14 A: (( and and most companies can't even afford and the company i think they requires that too )) 

389.18 404.04 A: they require these people you know any company to have that mandatory or random drug test because they want to be able to know whoever is coming to work for the company they ensure 

404.49 406.80 A: uh they want to be able to 

406.82 415.60 A: you know at least protect themselves you know they are in business to make money not in business to spend it foolishly [laughter] anyway 

410.11 411.51 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

415.17 417.78 B: yeah or someone who who's um 

417.87 422.27 B: um a bill- i mean who's um affected by drugs you know 

421.83 423.13 A: yeah 

422.62 423.66 B: yeah 

423.79 427.65 B: they don't wanna just give away money they- they're trying to help themselves you know 

423.81 424.53 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

427.31 432.00 A: oh yeah the more money they can make the better it is for them 

427.75 428.69 B: to buil- 

429.79 430.62 B: yeah 

431.18 432.55 B: yeah 

432.14 441.24 A: and let's say yourself if you invest in a company like that you know stocks and everything you want the company to be successful 

441.00 442.27 B: yeah 

441.93 455.93 A: a- and for a- any reason like i said the drug tests i think i think it's a good it's a good thing for a company to protect themselves [mn] as long as we are then we have so many 

455.67 456.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

456.28 463.70 A: ah irresponsible people now in the world like in stress and everything else 

463.73 470.35 A: can have people do things that they probably won't ordinarily do you know 

470.87 479.21 A: bu- but the point is like you know like the company like we said they have to protect themselves and and random 

478.03 479.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

479.26 490.20 A: drug tests is a good thing for them and the more the more i talk about it i think the better it sounds for this company because [laughter] you know 

481.08 482.28 B: [noise] 

489.83 495.80 B: [noise] [noise] yeah a lot of accidents can happen or you don't want anybody working for the government who's drunk [mn] 

491.99 493.27 A: yeah 

495.15 496.75 A: oh yeah 

496.31 503.54 B: they you know they might [laughter] they probably let a lot of let a lot of things go past lot of things go you know without even checking it out 

500.48 501.45 A: yeah 

503.57 513.21 A: yeah how many people even on their way to work you like you can be on your way to work you're perfectly okay and these people cause accident you know 

503.80 504.36 B: (( [mn] )) 

512.29 514.01 B: yeah 

513.36 522.37 A: and all these things like people would say well it's my li- it's my life it's my right but the thing is if you would only do it 

522.36 523.37 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

522.65 525.21 A: if you would only hurt yourself that 

525.15 534.96 A: would be good but you it you know it involves other people too like if you have accident on the road like the traffic stops 

534.85 541.47 A: that makes people you know late and everything but they don't know the indirect you know 

541.60 544.78 A: effect you know it has on other people 

544.81 552.97 A: (( and that's what makes it an an there is a saying which said your freedom starts where somebody else's ends you know )) 

544.86 545.77 B: yeah 

552.65 557.05 B: yeah 'cause i've heard you say you're not only hurting yourself you could be hurting others also [noise] [noise] 

555.96 562.88 A: yeah you hurt others and you inconvenience other people you inconven- you know all these things like 

562.89 575.54 A: you know you have to take that into consideration and how would the world be if everybody would do everything they should do we wouldn't need any police we wouldn't hurt anybody you know like 

575.33 580.44 A: d._u._i. people how many people who've been you know 

580.46 584.95 A: caught driving drunk several times 

585.00 599.96 A: and even though you charge these people money and you revoke their licence yet they continue to drive you know without their licence and they feel the and i think maybe companies like you know 

593.01 594.47 B: yeah
