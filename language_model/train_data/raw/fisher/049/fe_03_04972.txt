145.46 152.45 B: yeah well well i've learned that uh if you're able to exercise for for six months 

145.47 146.50 A: (( yeah 'cause )) 

151.94 153.29 A: mhm 

152.63 161.00 B: pretty regularly then then it becomes uh an addiction but it's almost then you can't help it you feel bad if you don't and feel guilt if you don't so 

155.62 156.46 A: yeah 

159.18 160.58 A: (( [noise] oh yeah )) 

160.80 167.77 A: yeah if i have a goal i seem to be able to like um coupla years ago we were going on a cruise 

161.50 162.24 B: so 

167.89 180.84 A: and we were going to be stopping in oka- oka- ocho rios in jamaica and i was wanting to climb the falls i don't know if you ever heard of it or not there's a waterfalls you can climb up uh it's called dunn's river falls and so i 

178.04 178.90 B: yeah 

180.84 187.92 A: actually started in about september and went for the whole winter uh over to a walking place and walked every day 

183.97 186.23 B: [noise] 

186.35 187.96 B: (( yeah oh that's great )) 

188.14 191.08 A: pardon me yeah 

189.11 191.92 B: that's great so you were motivated though right 

191.33 199.17 A: yeah exactly so i mean this is what i've got to get myself into is some kind of a a motivation that'll you know keep me going [laughter] 

199.04 206.92 B: well it sounds like your health uh would be pretty primary as far as uh your diabetes and wanting to address that and uh 

206.11 216.81 A: yeah yeah now i do uh i do some golfing i do some uh play slow pitch baseball that type of thing so i mean i don't i'm not totally sedentary [laughter] um 

215.69 217.35 B: yeah well 

216.79 221.17 A: it's just that it's not a regular regime that i have and uh but 

219.81 221.81 B: yeah how how old are you 

221.64 223.23 A: i'm uh sixty 

223.31 226.77 B: sixty my goodness well that's great 

223.88 224.68 A: yeah 

224.72 225.66 A: yeah 

225.71 229.51 A: yeah i've been retired now for six years and so 

229.56 231.80 B: well well that's great 

231.41 233.81 A: yeah and how about yourself 

233.47 246.74 B: oh i'm uh fifty four and uh yeah so but i i have been uh exercising oh probably as long as i can remember i played sports in high school and in college and so that just kinda 

234.95 237.72 A: fifty four eh oh yeah mhm yeah 

247.05 248.37 B: is something i do 

247.05 256.40 A: continued on yeah no i uh i was never in organized sports i i did sports and you know i played some hockey and this kind of thing but nothing 

248.54 249.76 B: but we 

256.46 257.55 A: um 

258.16 261.71 A: where i was you know say into a a routine 

261.62 263.69 B: not much competitiveness uh 

263.32 270.87 A: no and uh so my my life has never been uh you know a regimen of training and that kind of thing 

270.97 280.31 A: i had an office job and uh so you know it's not [cough] and um so i guess a guy just has to learn to get into it again [laughter] somehow [cough] 

280.09 290.00 B: yeah well again i think you sounds like you if you're motivated or like you said yourself if you've got a goal that you can accomplish that and i think that's exactly what it takes and 

285.93 287.24 A: mhm 

289.38 296.14 A: yeah i think the other thing that that you kinda drives you nuts is you'll start exercising and you expect to see results 

296.18 297.51 B: yeah that's 

296.53 302.91 A: and if you don't quickly it kinda discourages you too and so a guy has to get over that uh that idea 

300.09 301.93 B: you're right 

303.02 308.83 B: yeah i think you're right i think that again that's why i think that if you're able to just uh 

303.60 305.52 A: and but uh 

308.98 315.73 B: uh look towards uh the long run and the future and what that's going to do that uh 

312.59 313.53 A: mhm 

315.84 322.09 B: you can just kinda plan your strategy a little little less than what you might otherwise just take it a little at a time 

319.82 321.11 A: yeah right 

321.35 328.25 A: yeah so so this uh this gym at the hospital do they is it a membership thing or is it a free thing or 

328.37 337.37 B: no it it's it's a membership it costs every month and they have a they have a swimming pool and two racquetball courts 

328.45 329.52 A: (( that you go to )) 

332.35 333.28 A: oh yeah 

336.97 337.99 A: oh wow 

337.77 340.72 B: and uh uh it 

339.37 341.72 A: so it's a real facility real good facility 

341.37 348.50 B: yeah it's excellent it's really it's used primarily or initially initially it was going to be for cardiac patients 

342.09 342.65 A: (( yeah )) 

348.02 349.14 A: yeah 

348.55 350.92 B: uh to rehabilitate 

350.54 351.83 A: mhm 

351.25 354.76 B: so but uh they it's it's open to whoever 

354.52 366.03 A: oh it is it's yeah yeah it's not uh it's not restricted at all then except just yeah long as you pay [laughter] so oh yeah and who like the actual hospital runs it then and is it a um 

354.83 357.25 B: whomever yeah 

358.50 359.38 B: (( no )) 

360.19 363.73 B: (( that's right that's right that's right )) 

366.41 368.15 A: a break even 

366.50 377.02 B: yeah it's just well that i don't know i would i i would imagine that they would certainly want it to pay for itself and i assume that it probably gets close if it doesn't 

369.75 370.77 A: oh 

376.41 382.37 A: yeah because i would i would think the state wouldn't want to be throwing money in or the [laughter] anybody like that 

377.03 378.21 B: uh so 

381.22 387.30 B: well well it's privately owned it's a church uh non not for profit hospital so 

386.18 396.16 A: oh yeah mhm oh yeah so the church if they wanted to subsidize they could with no problem no arguments anyway i should say no pr- it's always a problem [laughter] but getting the money 

391.12 392.91 B: (( well yeah that's right )) 

394.80 397.54 B: that's right that's right 

396.14 401.88 A: and uh so so what type of exercising do you do then do you all different types or mainly walking 

401.15 401.96 B: uh 

402.00 403.96 B: i usually uh 

403.89 414.90 B: uh for the cardio aerobic part i i do the stairmaster for about thirty minutes and and then i just uh then i do well some of the machines and the free weights uh 

408.53 410.01 A: mhm 

414.82 425.83 B: try to work on upper body one day and legs and and uh uh arms another day and you know that that kind of thing so 

419.70 420.63 A: (( oh yeah )) 

423.45 424.33 A: mhm 

425.20 429.60 A: and do you go at a certain time every day pretty well or if it 

428.01 434.24 B: i i try to go i try to go about this time about three o'clock down here central time for us 

433.97 436.03 A: (( oh yeah mm so wh- )) 

434.34 436.17 B: uh and uh 

436.22 438.01 A: is it three o'clock now there 

438.01 439.72 B: yeah uh no it's two 

439.36 445.49 A: two yeah yeah i see so so you usually go usually go early afternoon maybe after lunch or something then 

445.46 449.56 B: yes yeah yeah [noise] but uh 

445.96 448.50 A: (( yeah oh yeah )) 

448.70 449.79 A: (( and uh )) 

449.88 451.84 B: works better for me 

451.04 454.62 A: yeah and what do you find is the best uh 

455.15 457.52 A: exercise say for uh 

458.36 465.67 A: maybe for say keeping your weight down or whatever is it all of them or do you have one that you like like walking is that the best or 

465.82 472.55 B: well uh you know they say whoever they is that uh walking is is just uh about the best you can do but i 

468.65 469.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

471.91 473.21 A: mhm 

472.76 478.96 B: uh i've always been i've been pretty competitive minded and uh you know always wanted to do more than 

479.14 481.64 B: what i probably should do so 

480.95 482.24 A: mhm 

481.65 482.70 B: i uh 

482.81 484.34 B: uh even when i was 

484.51 493.22 B: getting ready to to do some of these exercises and stuff i had to do a a stress test and they said well here's your goal and so i always try to 

489.36 490.16 A: mhm 

493.49 502.57 B: uh and they and they and they you know it's really kind of silly on my part because they say don't you don't have to overdo just do your goal and that's going to be effective enough but i always 

501.79 503.56 A: yeah oh yeah 

502.63 504.48 B: think i have to do more so 

504.06 506.64 A: yeah like you haven't had any health problems or anything then 

506.47 511.43 B: no i haven't i've always been in pretty good pretty good health so i've been very fortunate in that and 

507.20 507.85 A: (( no )) 

509.28 510.36 A: (( oh that's good )) 

511.62 513.51 B: uh never had any problems 

513.14 513.74 A: (( yeah )) 

513.89 515.26 B: which has been nice [noise] 

513.98 514.79 A: (( yeah )) 

515.04 523.45 A: no i i haven't had too much except uh cartilage in the knees and that but uh that's one of the problems i have with walking is uh 

521.61 522.56 B: yeah 

523.48 526.67 A: sometimes my knees can start to to bother me 

526.43 536.17 B: i've had i i could not run on the on the street you know and kind of cross country type stuff 'cause it seemed like that the the pounding would always 

526.89 527.54 A: (( so )) 

530.21 531.48 A: (( mm yeah )) 

536.71 538.54 B: hurt my knees as well 

538.27 539.36 A: yeah 

538.72 545.91 B: so but i and the treadmills even did that for me that's why the st- the stairmaster really works well that might be something you might want to try 

544.04 545.25 A: mhm 

545.63 551.75 A: yeah yeah we have one of those hanging uh what do they call them those uh it was called a health walker it was 

546.29 547.10 B: or 

551.94 556.33 A: those suspended ones you you might have seen uh ads on them where you 

553.68 554.58 B: oh really 

556.50 565.35 A: you're actually like swinging in them back and forth yeah tony little has one out the gazelle i think it's called yeah we have one of those [laughter] too so 

558.81 561.28 B: oh yeah yeah yeah 

562.29 563.35 B: yeah 

565.11 565.98 B: wow 

565.60 568.86 A: um we've got we've got lots of stuff [laughter] it's 

568.33 570.64 B: sounds like you do sounds like you got every 

569.29 570.67 A: it's getting on to it 

570.77 572.64 B: everything you need right there 

571.72 576.87 A: [cough] yeah and it's right at home here so it's [laughter] not even a case of having to go out and uh 

575.77 580.17 B: well one thing i learned for me i had to pay for it or i wouldn't do it at home 

579.86 581.20 A: mhm yeah 

580.29 586.44 B: uh that was uh that was part of my motivation was okay i'm paying for this i'd better get out there and do it so 

585.54 588.56 A: that's very true yeah yeah if you don't uh 

587.15 588.25 B: so 

588.76 597.22 A: it's uh it's easy to not bother when you're not putting money out i know with even with my walking when i was getting ready for the uh 

597.45 599.95 A: the falls climb i uh
