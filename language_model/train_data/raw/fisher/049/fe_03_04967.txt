0.26 2.49 B: (( how are you doing my name is curtis )) 

2.49 4.50 A: hey my name's mark 

4.04 5.12 B: (( how you doing sir )) 

5.08 6.57 A: hey pretty good how are you 

5.42 9.30 B: i'm doing pretty good ah 

9.31 10.42 B: (( i kind of cau- )) 

9.49 15.90 A: so actually could you could you repeat 'cause i i couldn't hear um what the actual question is was they just said 

16.21 24.10 B: i i believe the correct question was ah about it was about censorship should certain books be 

25.36 30.06 B: re- read in public schools or something i i didn't catch it very clear 

27.72 29.07 A: oh right yeah 

29.71 32.43 A: yeah okay so this is about public school okay cool 

31.58 33.52 B: right and censorship [noise] 

35.42 39.25 A: um okay well yeah what do you think about that 

39.54 45.58 B: [noise] well ah [noise] i i guess i i would feel that [noise] 

46.13 49.44 B: certain books would be okay just as long as they're not [noise] 

49.73 60.06 B: they don't cause the need to any offence to anyone or create any kind of problem mm as long as long as long as they're you know educational books 

53.41 54.42 A: yeah 

56.08 57.03 A: yeah 

60.22 63.31 B: that that are cool 

63.72 69.92 B: or or you know good educational books that you learn something from 

69.49 70.62 A: yeah 

70.03 74.17 B: then then i i i don't see a problem with it 

75.10 78.28 A: yeah i pretty much agree i mean i would think it should be like 

78.94 83.61 A: it should be up to like the school board and the teachers and whoever else to like come up with 

83.83 86.48 A: good books for the students to read and then 

86.92 88.00 A: i mean 

88.55 89.72 A: obviously 

89.87 94.05 A: there's always a chance that somebody could com- complain about a book like maybe 

94.06 98.17 A: a parent doesn't want their kid to read a certain book or something but 

97.20 99.73 B: or a certain certain subject you know 

99.38 102.38 A: yeah but hopefully it shouldn't be a cause for like 

102.39 106.17 A: everybody to get censored it should just be like well you know maybe that 

106.37 112.98 A: maybe that student could like you know whatever switch to [noise] a different class or like figure out a different book to read or something like that 

112.39 113.60 B: yeah that's true 

113.76 116.52 A: i don't know that's like i'm a i guess 'cause ah 

116.69 119.48 A: i know like in the past they've censored um 

120.20 126.34 A: like good books just because some people complained about them and i think y- you have to like 

124.01 125.29 B: right 

126.82 133.55 A: you know just i mean it should be like by age you know like maybe some young kids aren't ready to read something about 

133.06 134.44 B: a certain thing 

133.87 144.18 A: something complicated like um if it's about sex or if it's about racism or things like that there's all kind of like issues that maybe you need to be a certain age to really understand 

140.68 143.06 B: (( [mn] some books on it and )) 

143.59 144.96 B: right 

144.65 149.54 A: but hopefully like high school kids won't have a problem if they have a good teacher to explain everything 

149.30 152.20 B: i i i think probably where the 

152.42 158.17 B: if that problem did come up that would probably come up ah more 

158.66 159.88 B: (( more or less )) 

160.42 163.85 B: i wouldn't think elementary school i i would think middle school 

163.59 164.60 A: yeah 

164.02 165.45 B: middle school probably 

165.55 167.20 A: yeah 

167.77 168.85 B: (( ah )) 

170.03 174.54 B: my my my thought is what you know what kind of what kind of books are they 

174.72 176.58 B: are they censoring you know 

176.64 177.74 A: yeah 

179.24 181.51 A: so do you have kids yourself 

181.08 182.95 B: no i i don't have any children 

182.67 184.04 A: yeah me neither 

184.34 187.85 A: so i mean i i don't know i i guess when i was in school 

188.08 195.93 A: i um as far as i know we didn't really have that come up like i never heard of any books being censored 

195.50 196.50 B: me either 

196.03 199.69 A: from my school so i don't really have any first hand experience 

199.31 200.82 B: the books i was used to 

201.67 204.40 B: ah if if any besides 

205.26 207.01 B: math or or [noise] 

207.14 209.38 B: those types of things were 

209.40 216.10 B: u._s. soc- social studies books stuff like that [noise] ah hi- history history type books that's 

216.59 218.91 B: that's the kind of books i remember [noise] [noise] 

218.87 220.19 A: yeah 

219.03 233.69 B: i i mean of course you got different subjects in there about world events or or or stuff like that but i i didn't see anything ah i felt that ought to be censored out 

233.80 235.43 A: yeah 

235.58 239.01 A: so do you do you ever think like maybe there was some 

239.15 242.87 A: maybe some books some history books or whatever that 

243.39 248.14 A: that like you didn't have the chance to read in school that maybe you should've 

247.97 249.18 B: i believe so 

249.10 257.62 A: yeah like maybe you've you missed out on some of some points or view or like some i don't know like i don't know how old are you 

250.66 251.67 B: (( i mean i )) 

257.55 258.62 B: twenty nine 

258.39 260.43 A: twenty nine okay yeah i'm twenty six so 

259.10 263.06 B: i i i graduated okay i graduated when i was ah 

261.17 262.96 A: yeah we're around the same age then 

263.88 267.31 B: i graduated a year early actually i graduated in ninety one 

265.79 266.61 A: mhm 

267.37 268.85 A: yeah 

269.02 273.71 B: i i i believe there there there was some some stuff i missed out on 

274.36 277.64 A: like i read the book the people's history of the united states 

277.27 278.22 B: (( [mn] okay )) 

277.89 287.47 A: i don't know if you heard of that book but it's kind of like an alternative history and it it kind of talks about all of the all of the stuff that you missed in history class 

279.08 280.00 B: no 

287.01 287.88 B: okay 

287.84 292.79 A: like all the stories like about i mean especially a lot of stuff with um 

293.58 306.68 A: you know treatment of native americans or like exploitation of people by you know whatever corrupt you know people in power that you d- you never hear about in your history class they just kind of brush over that stuff 

302.15 303.65 B: right right 

304.78 305.78 B: yeah i know 

306.82 310.36 B: ah act- actually tell you the truth too there there's 

310.87 319.03 B: even some in the history book that i mean it might give a little detail but it's not it's not giving you the full story 

319.07 320.77 A: yeah 

320.69 321.66 B: why 

322.32 327.53 B: may- maybe in a way that's good too 'cause if if it was in full detail they they would probably censor it 

327.61 333.35 A: [laughter] yeah but that's i mean that's just another kind of censorship i guess like when they don't 

328.69 329.52 B: you know 

333.83 335.89 A: [cough] when they don't give you the full story 

335.80 337.98 B: now i i feel that ah 

339.95 342.48 B: el- elementary kids definitely shouldn't [mn] 

343.98 353.72 B: well i don't think it's really a problem in elementary school ah level but i i i would think the 

353.97 360.48 B: ah elementary sc- school kids shouldn't be learn- learning anything about ah 

360.73 362.43 B: sex or anything else 

362.53 363.46 A: mhm 

362.69 367.34 B: i i i would say now for the middle middle aged school students 

364.68 366.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

367.39 377.78 B: are growing up ah you know subjects that are gonna come up that that would be a a better time but elementary school kids shouldn't be 

379.13 380.14 B: (( ah )) 

380.18 381.08 B: you know 

381.45 383.08 A: mhm 

382.29 383.09 B: (( learn- [mn] )) 

383.22 385.39 B: knowing anything about that subject 

385.53 395.91 B: or th- then again you never know i'm i'm not saying it was but it could've been a book written and elementary school kids could've re- read something out of 

385.54 386.35 A: yeah 

396.32 398.21 B: it i mean i i doubt it but you know 

398.14 399.12 A: yeah 

398.24 400.27 B: that's that's just a thought 

403.38 404.60 A: yeah so 

405.32 408.25 A: i don't know like i haven't heard much about 

408.85 421.37 A: i mean i know there's there's always like lists every year of books that have been censored by certain schools here and there but it seems kind of like a isolated thing like one school here or there will censor a book but then like 

413.16 414.32 B: (( are censored )) 

421.68 426.71 A: a bunch of other schools they're they're reading it so you know [laughter] it doesn't like a 

425.24 429.53 B: actually to tell you the truth this this is this is my first time ah 

429.97 432.00 B: ever hearing about something like this 

431.64 432.83 A: oh really 

432.31 433.58 B: mhm 

432.99 439.91 A: 'cause there's actually a book ah or i mean ah a list of books that it's that's put out every year um 'cause i remember 

440.25 455.22 A: [lipsmack] re- seeing it in like a magazine or something it was like an article about about all these books that like you know some school in some random little out of the way place decided to censor it 'cause somebody didn't like it and you know the parents were like censor this book and then 

443.40 444.29 B: okay 

449.55 450.85 B: (( mhm )) 

455.57 466.76 A: and so it was like a list of all the books but a lot of the books are like really popular books that like meanwhile millions of kids other places are reading that book so like you know mark twain 

463.12 464.73 B: (( oh right )) 

467.51 468.99 A: huckleberry finn 

468.76 469.65 B: okay 

469.27 479.35 A: you know those were like really popular books but and you know there's always like one or two schools that censor it because they think that the kids aren't ready to deal with 

479.41 483.08 A: the you know sort of complex stuff in it you know 

482.28 483.15 B: (( uh-huh )) 

483.11 486.29 A: and but then there's like ten other schools where they are reading it so 

487.08 492.39 A: you know it's kind of like it just seems like a random thing like it just depends on how 

492.71 495.72 A: conservative that one little school is so 

494.98 499.05 B: the the school right and then of course it's up to the 

499.24 501.62 B: the school board or the administration 

502.37 503.64 A: yeah 

502.47 507.15 B: to de- decide on what books stay and what books go 

507.55 515.26 A: yeah i think as long as the books are available in the library for people to read it's okay it's not like 

515.19 523.32 A: kids should have to read every controversial book out there if they don't want to it's but i think books should be available in the library for people 

518.47 519.82 B: (( [noise] right )) 

522.48 524.75 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah [noise] )) 

523.86 531.06 A: um i mean if it's like and like even even in elementary school there should be books in the library for students about 

531.14 541.37 A: like um sex sex education and things like that because by the time you get to sixth grade you're already old enough to to start learning about that kind of thing 

535.52 537.66 B: (( yeah i i believe so [noise] [noise] )) 

542.54 543.49 A: (( so )) 

543.93 547.93 B: that's true yeah that's that's a good idea or or [mn] 

544.91 546.25 A: yeah 

548.42 556.60 B: [noise] i'm trying to think of some some other subjects or some some good books that that would be good 

548.96 549.55 A: (( [noise] )) 

557.32 558.23 B: (( [noise] mm [noise] )) 

560.61 564.45 B: i i have to think about that one [laughter] 

561.21 562.20 A: (( i don't know )) 

563.19 564.11 A: [laughter] 

565.56 568.14 A: yeah i mean it seems like we don't really have 

568.46 570.39 A: that much of a problem 

570.59 574.05 A: from my point of view we don't have that much of a problem with censorship 

570.60 572.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

574.18 588.74 A: i mean 'cause every time there is a little thing that comes up it makes it makes all the headlines and everybody goes crazy oh my god censorship you know it's like this big scary word and once you say it then you know people are like oh okay well you know i wasn't trying to censor or whatever 

583.88 585.05 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

586.37 588.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

588.90 589.96 B: yeah that's true 

589.92 591.73 A: so it seems like the 

591.95 599.59 A: the the media does a pretty good job of like kind of keeping that in check by like making a big deal when there is any kind of censorship 

598.43 599.95 B: [noise] yeah
