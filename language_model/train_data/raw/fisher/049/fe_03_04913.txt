81.51 82.69 A: yeah 

82.11 85.68 B: i didn't have any problem with it because i didn't have anything to hide 

84.81 86.16 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

85.82 88.69 B: uh once again i think that uh 

88.80 89.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

90.35 101.79 B: it's like a double edged sword i believe if you don't [noise] do it you don't have anything to worry about if you do it that's a choice that you make and then that is um 

92.70 93.58 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

95.85 96.84 A: mhm 

98.49 100.01 A: (( mhm [noise] ))

103.93 105.12 A: (( yeah definitely [noise] )) 

105.02 112.07 B: you know so uh it's it's good to to hear you say you know you don't do it that's good there's a lot of kids that do 

105.65 106.73 A: [noise] 

109.91 111.19 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

111.78 113.25 A: (( oh yeah uh-huh )) 

112.28 120.37 B: um and that doesn't just necessarily mean hard drugs that means drinking and you know just a whole bunch of other stuff but uh 

120.63 123.29 B: as far as the privacy part is 

122.76 124.34 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

124.00 127.49 B: it's sorta if you're gonna work out in the real world 

127.25 128.31 A: mhm 

127.69 131.37 B: you're gonna l- have to leave one of those things and that's privacy 

131.62 135.66 B: away from there because you know you're [sigh] 

131.73 134.16 A: (( mhm that's right definitely )) 

135.90 143.07 B: you are not only representing yourself you're representing your family and uh a lot of other things so 

140.77 142.06 A: mhm 

143.07 151.58 B: uh [sigh] if you don't have anything to worry about well then you know it shouldn't bother you one bit and i i can see a lot of people [sigh] 

151.91 160.25 B: throwing up a red flag going hey you know this isn't fair well it's only fair because they're doing something they sh- they sh they know they shouldn't be doing 

160.80 168.01 A: and i don't think that drug tests are a hundred per cent sure 'cause i see people they ah they drink certain things like ah 

167.54 168.47 B: sure 

168.19 177.37 A: vinegar or something if it washes out the system or something i mean sometimes they get by with it and i'm like how'd you get by with that they're like oh i did this and i'm like well ah

430.35 442.51 B: an an urban country area to where you can be right in the middle of gridlock and you can break away one or two streets over and be sort of like in the country ah and that's one good thing that's about 

438.90 439.95 A: mhm 

442.55 447.95 B: this area but ah it's growing like anywhere else it's growing

461.08 470.11 B: so right but ah you know getting back to the question on the testing i- it's i think it's mandatory if if a person or a ah 

464.12 464.94 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

470.13 481.72 B: an employer wants to know what type of a mindset their employees are they've got to do it ah to make sure that they're not jeopardizing somebody else

504.19 517.19 B: [mn] at this point ah [mn] the main thing i would do is ah if ah i was asked to i wouldn't blink an eye i'd go ahead and and ah you know i think it'd just hey it comes with the territory 

516.87 518.72 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

517.75 529.43 B: basically that's what it is if you're if you don't like being tested well then go in business for yourself and be your own boss and then you know once again the choices that you make 

529.36 530.23 A: mhm 

529.46 535.67 B: ah ah will always come back to either ah enhance you or come back and bite ya
