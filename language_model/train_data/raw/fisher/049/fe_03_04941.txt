11.95 14.02 B: g. e. r. r. i. 

13.89 16.15 A: (( oh terri t. e. r. r. y. )) 

15.26 17.75 B: no g. like in george 

17.36 19.24 A: okay now i got you 

19.01 25.92 B: yeah what do you think about uh what is your opinion on censorship for books in public and private schools 

25.74 34.46 B: do you think kids you know should be just allowed to read what they want or you know uh do you think that some things should be a no no to them 

34.36 41.70 A: well i think there's some things should be a no no in school yeah yeah and uh 

38.40 40.62 B: mhm mhm 

41.59 46.99 B: such as i mean what are you like opposed to like i think you know um 

41.81 43.52 A: if a parent 

47.48 49.11 B: that um 

48.98 55.33 B: if there are certain books in school like i think you know that most of the books in school 

55.14 68.29 B: um would be suitable for children or they wouldn't be there i don't think there would be anything in the school that would that that uh a child would read that would be any harm to them 

67.90 68.95 A: (( hm )) 

68.74 78.76 B: uh i mean like you know uh i don't think there's anything that they shouldn't read that should [laughter] and i could be mistaken but i'm sure like most of the books in school 

78.53 86.55 B: are there for children to read and they wouldn't put them there if the books weren't suitable for them to read 

87.00 91.86 A: yeah i'm sure that's correct well 

88.62 92.54 B: well i mean wh- what do you oppose about that 

92.26 97.35 A: i don't oppose any of that i just don't let uh uh just anything through 

97.54 99.81 A: that they might get their hands on they wouldn't 

99.98 104.14 A: wouldn't have to be something that the school had approved and put in there 

102.70 111.70 B: oh okay now you're talking about if someone would bring something to school that wasn't suitable for a child to read is that what you're saying 

108.69 110.07 A: other word 

111.68 115.83 A: (( yeah )) 

111.93 121.98 B: okay uh maybe i misunderstood the topic i thought it was just you know um books that are given at school now of course 

117.51 120.75 A: (( well )) 

120.85 124.22 A: i i didn't i didn't really understand what she was saying 

123.86 137.24 B: yeah i i'm kind of a little vague about that also uh she just said you know should children be allowed to read what they want in public or you know sh- or or should they should be censored in public or um [cough] 

124.00 125.21 A: (( i got yeah yeah )) 

125.16 145.27 A: (( right )) 

137.32 151.11 B: uh private schools now of course if they're going to bring material that's to the school that's not suitable for them to read of course they should not definitely not be allowed to read that 

150.56 151.83 A: (( yeah )) 

151.10 165.41 B: but if the material that's in the school uh is given to them i'm sure that you know that material is suitable or if their teachers or their librarian or wherever they have access to books 

162.37 165.01 A: (( well )) 

165.29 171.74 B: uh i mean i'm sure there wouldn't be anything that would be you know any harm to them [mn] 

171.24 172.32 A: let's hope 

172.27 183.87 B: yeah so you were thinking along the terms that if they brought something like from their home or uh like another bookstore or anything and they brought it to school 

177.20 180.44 A: (( so )) 

180.45 183.57 A: (( mhm )) 

184.07 198.75 B: yeah well i i think if they brought anything from the outside uh and they started to read it i mean um [mn] without knowing the teacher you know knowing the tea- uh you know uh the teacher didn't know that the child was reading it 

186.60 190.18 A: (( yeah )) 

198.53 209.93 B: i mean that's a very possible that a child can do that and of course that shouldn't be done but it didn't make sense to me to think along those terms of course i could be wrong 

211.01 213.61 A: (( well that that uh )) 

213.65 216.76 A: has happened but then probably not often 

216.47 224.15 B: yeah right right right uh-huh i'm sure you know the kids see a lot of uh material that they shouldn't see 

217.44 219.21 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

223.97 226.78 B: and you know i'm sure they do go to 

224.10 226.37 A: (( yeah )) 

226.57 237.49 B: uh magazine shops and bookshops where you know there is adult material available and they do see all this and of course that's a possibility that 

229.84 232.24 A: mhm 

237.27 245.68 B: they can bring it to school and show all their friends i mean that is a big possibility and of course that should never never be allowed 

239.46 242.68 A: mhm 

245.81 248.70 A: mhm 

245.88 257.62 B: uh if i was a teacher that would never be allowed in my room and i'm sure the you know most uh parents would agree that that you know that you know that shouldn't be allowed 

259.03 267.91 B: have any of your children or anything have ever taken anything to school that been not been known to you that was not permissible for them to read 

260.20 263.46 A: right 

268.35 270.09 A: (( not that i know of )) 

269.84 276.26 B: not that we know of of course we don't know that as parents you know but that is a very possibility 

270.91 272.40 A: (( um yeah )) 

276.05 289.47 B: and not only that even if your child doesn't take it to school another child can take it to school and pass it around to all his friends and his classmates and you would have no way of knowing that 

277.95 280.32 A: (( yeah )) 

285.22 287.04 A: right 

289.43 292.88 B: but i mean uh i think that they mean 

292.78 300.27 B: because um i think that they mean about the stuff that's given in school now maybe i'm taking it wrong but i think you know 

295.05 330.20 A: (( right )) 

300.16 310.20 B: that if the teacher decides that the material uh is beneficial to the child and it's very educational and very knowledgeable 

310.05 315.29 B: uh the teacher should make the decision as to what she wants her students to read 

315.48 328.92 B: now i'm not saying that i a a teacher can't offer like maybe one day a week i know that if i was a teacher i would say to my students is there any like particular book that you find very interesting 

328.95 331.47 B: that the whole class would enjoy 

331.31 338.44 B: and maybe if you can tell me the title i can get the book and we all can read it together and we all can learn from it 

338.27 350.57 B: and i think you know that would be a good idea to get kids to know uh voice their opinion about their favorite reading material and see how much they enjoy it and then get a reaction from the kids as to 

350.62 353.01 B: uh if they enjoyed it also 

353.03 354.14 A: [noise] 

353.20 364.34 B: and this way it gives everybody an opportunity to voice their opinion about what they like to read and what they enjoy and what they got from the book and how much they learned from it 

355.13 357.74 A: mhm 

362.55 367.75 A: (( right )) 

364.26 375.23 B: and i think like a once a week thing would be very good and the rest of the week you know the teacher assigns what she thinks is best uh reading material that they should have do you think that's a good idea 

373.30 374.88 A: (( mm mhm )) 

375.15 376.38 A: (( sounds good to )) 

376.42 380.43 A: (( me )) 

376.48 379.94 B: yeah i think that sounds like a very good idea 

379.95 389.51 B: and because reading is so important to kids i mean because i mean i don't think like at any age you're never too old enough to learn 

380.95 387.38 A: (( yeah )) 

389.52 399.27 B: there's so many things in this world to learn that if you read to the end of time there would probably [laughter] still be things to know about and i think you know kids that 

394.69 396.42 A: (( [laughter] )) 

397.41 399.33 A: yeah 

399.24 404.09 B: uh don't like to read are missing out on so much 

403.86 405.23 A: yeah 

404.03 410.41 B: and a lot of kids don't like to read you know today with the television and the video games and 

405.21 453.05 A: (( mhm )) 

410.25 421.23 B: all that hip hop music and all that kind of stuff and you know they're so absorbed in that that they tend not to read like you know i think generations ago 

421.01 433.34 B: and i think like they're missing out on so much because there's so much to be learned today by reading and it's very hard to get kids to encourage them to read 

433.27 445.41 B: and um i used to have a friend i mean she's dead now but um she was a teacher and her mother died at a young age and her father had to raise them all there was eight of them 

446.41 457.81 B: and he used to ma- [mn] before they went to bed every night he would give them a book a storybook and they had to read the whole story like he thought that that was very 

457.58 464.69 B: very good for them to kn- to get into a habit of reading get into a good habit and to learn from it 

464.53 471.49 B: and like all her brothers and sisters are all college graduates and [mn] out of the whole eight of them 

471.25 482.20 B: she only had one brother who was a cab driver but every one [mn] one of the- one of them went on to college and i mean you know because you know when you go to college you have to do so much reading 

482.02 487.03 B: and they were s- you know reading was instilled in them at such a young age 

486.88 499.25 B: that you know they just just it became such a habit to them and they enjoyed it so much and they you know they enjoyed going to college and studying and reading and they so i think like it's a real good idea 

499.15 510.48 B: for kids to get in the habit of reading good literature i mean like parents should try to take them like to the library [lipsmack] and you know show them all the different books and uh 

503.68 515.19 A: (( yeah mm )) 

510.28 525.18 B: try to get them interested in all different kinds of thing and it's a real nice experience for a kid i know when my kids were growing up i we always went to the library and my kids always enjoyed that part of the day going to the library seeing all the books 

515.02 520.40 A: (( yeah )) 

524.84 525.40 A: (( yeah )) 

524.95 532.83 B: and you know seeing what new books when they we would take the old books back and seeing what new more new books they had 

526.56 539.70 A: (( mhm )) 

532.69 542.24 B: and they really really enjoyed that and you know i always tried to stress you know you can learn so much by reading i mean as old as i am today i still 

542.12 552.17 B: everyday i have to read it becomes it's such a habit with me that [mn] my day doesn't seem complete unless i read some you know literature 

550.94 557.50 A: mm yeah yeah yeah well what part of the country are you from 

556.36 560.24 B: i'm from philadelphia where are you from yeah where are you from
