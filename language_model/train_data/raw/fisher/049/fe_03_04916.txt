142.55 144.06 B: (( ah mhm )) 

143.52 151.81 A: uh it's not for drug testing but [sigh] like the things that you fill out in the application so 

147.03 148.24 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

151.86 162.72 A: the type of st- ah what is it like have you ever been convicted you know the companies will go through background check whether you're lying or 

155.97 157.59 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

162.94 175.79 A: [sigh] ah you know they check on your credit reference they check where you lived before [sigh] ah they do a lot of checks before they say okay we want you

175.82 176.97 B: (( yeah )) 

176.50 180.16 A: [mn] so there's a lot of things that are being done 

179.53 180.98 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

180.92 184.63 A: [sigh] ah so is that an invasion of privacy 

184.69 186.80 A: ah i don't know 

186.93 188.13 B: (( yeah )) 

188.24 195.77 B: yeah this is hard to call you know what i mean they they obviously give you the option of you know [sigh] doing it or not so [sigh] 

193.65 194.96 A: mhm 

196.11 197.95 A: right 

196.84 204.90 B: i don't know i- i've never really had a problem with it i mean i i had to when i first started they did the drug test and [sigh] they um 

204.92 210.35 B: they they say that you know they could have random testing f- i'm i'm under the impression that they only do it 

208.66 211.44 A: (( right )) 

210.47 212.17 B: if like the person is um 

212.49 214.73 B: you know using drugs or whatnot so [mn] 

215.00 218.12 A: right though sometimes you can't really tell 

217.87 219.62 B: yeah 

218.71 220.61 A: you know whether the person 

220.88 227.43 A: have used it in the past or is using it at ah screening or 

227.46 228.43 B: yeah 

227.86 231.16 A: i mean i i don't know all the symptoms to say 

231.16 232.66 B: yeah 

232.25 235.98 A: [sigh] but an invasion of privacy ah 

237.66 241.78 A: [mn] that's very very interesting -m not sure 

240.04 241.20 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

242.37 247.46 A: um what i mean even the government does all this 

247.63 248.61 B: (( yeah )) 

248.15 255.92 A: and ah i'm thinking that everything is okay meaning my privacy hasn't been invaded 

256.19 257.29 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

257.05 257.87 A: um 

259.01 264.21 A: [mn] if you wanna work for the government you gotta go through their system of process 

264.03 265.69 B: mhm 

265.18 266.37 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

266.63 272.01 A: yeah i don't think it's ah it's that big de- big of a deal 

271.85 279.70 B: yeah [noise] yeah yeah [sigh] i guess i'd look at it in terms of anything that's considered illegal i mean i guess you wouldn't want anybody that's killed somebody or 

279.74 284.04 B: anyone that has an extensive criminal record necessarily i mean it 

279.90 281.67 A: right 

284.58 285.53 B: (( [sigh] it kinda )) 

284.58 285.33 A: (( no )) 

286.02 287.94 B: it's just one of those things you 

288.63 290.96 A: right if you were 

291.08 298.57 A: working in heavy machinery and if you're using drugs what are the impacts are you gonna hurt yourself 

298.70 302.37 A: as well as hurting other people that you're working with 

302.27 303.21 B: (( know [sigh] )) 

303.02 316.54 A: i me- if i was the employer i'd be more concerned about that um you know earth moving equipment uh building constructions you know sky towers 

307.09 308.59 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

316.29 317.79 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

317.85 322.13 A: uh [mn] 'cause people do get hurt and if you're 

322.29 324.42 A: not hundred per cent 

324.67 325.90 A: (( ah )) 

326.76 338.53 A: ah if you're not hundred per cent at work because you're using drugs i i think it's bad so is it really an invasion of privacy 

334.39 335.44 B: (( mm yeah yeah )) 

338.65 347.10 A: uh i think in a way i'm sure the employer has their own objectives why they wanna keep track of those things 

346.79 348.39 B: mhm 

347.54 351.95 A: uh and the employee or potential employee has certain 

353.03 359.07 A: um certain objective whether to give out that information or not to give it out 

358.46 360.17 B: (( [sigh] mhm mhm )) 

359.30 367.08 A: [mn] but from my perspective it's making sure that you know that people don't get hurt 

367.47 369.98 A: and that they're productive at work 

369.73 371.82 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

371.83 373.21 B: (( [sigh] that's true yeah [noise] )) 

372.05 374.89 A: maybe if they're too productive you know 

374.95 382.15 A: uh by using drugs [laughter] [laughter] the employers would subsidize [laughter] 

376.84 378.15 B: [laughter] 

380.65 383.18 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

383.95 388.12 A: i mean think of it this way remem- uh 

389.17 400.15 A: uh in the nineteen fifties and sixties uh they introduced coffee at the work place because it got it got employees very peppy 

400.26 402.30 A: alert 

401.70 402.72 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

402.31 405.99 A: so they can be more productive 

405.02 406.24 B: right 

406.12 415.05 A: now if they really need someone to work round the clock you know they can provide speed or something [laughter] 

413.33 417.33 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

416.21 425.44 A: [laughter] so you know you're working twenty three hours a day [laughter] you're wide awake 

421.14 423.50 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [laughter] )) 

424.66 426.51 B: (( yeah )) 

426.63 431.59 B: yeah i gu- i guess they just do an analysis of the risk factors and you know 

430.62 432.44 A: (( [noise] right )) 

431.83 441.98 B: i i guess you know speed would obviously have other risks associated with it and it's not really worth it but yeah i guess coffee isn't isn't too bad so [sigh] 

442.17 444.98 A: (( yeah oh y- you do )) 

444.16 445.30 B: (( yeah ha- )) 

445.88 447.18 B: i- go ahead 

446.40 455.15 A: you know what ah state of california's law is in regards to doing drug testing is it legal or illegal 

452.84 453.99 B: (( no i )) 

455.18 457.01 B: i'm i'm [noise] not sure actually oh 

457.91 465.52 A: oh 'cause there was a big debate or controversy over that ah whether 

466.24 468.92 A: whether it's legal or illegal 

468.60 469.51 B: oh really 

469.54 479.41 A: yeah just because in a way it is invasion of your privacy what i do at home really shouldn't matter at a place of work 

479.17 480.82 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

480.69 487.38 A: but then again the side effects you know what you do at home may carry towards work 

486.89 488.04 B: yeah 

487.51 491.77 A: considering you're spending at least eight hours a day at work 

491.47 492.42 B: (( mhm yeah i'm )) 

494.69 496.47 B: (( not really sure not really sure )) 

496.81 504.67 A: [noise] mhm oh something that i guess i can look it up and see what it says but it's ah interesting 

506.45 507.22 B: (( yeah yeah yeah true )) 

507.39 509.84 A: [sigh] [mn] what do you think about this ah 

510.46 511.57 A: (( ah )) 

511.96 514.68 A: what is this survey that they're doing 

515.03 519.55 B: oh it s- it seems pretty interesting i mean i've had i've only had one other 

520.63 525.10 B: um conversation before and it was kind of about something a little less um 

525.60 531.11 B: [sigh] i don't kn- intense i guess it was just about movies and stuff like that so [sigh] i don't know i 

530.22 531.52 A: (( oh nice )) 

531.30 537.81 B: the the the things that i can relate to um ah seem to be the most interesting 

538.83 543.62 B: ah so i don't know i gu- i guess the drug testing has never really been a problem or 

543.91 548.81 B: [mn] i mean i've ha- i've had to do one but it's never been a problem or anything 

543.99 545.56 A: (( [noise] right )) 

548.61 557.29 A: right i'm sure there are people that are very concerned or that refuse to do it 

553.49 554.64 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] yeah yeah yeah yeah [sigh] )) 

556.38 557.55 B: yeah 

557.44 563.48 A: so i guess for those people it is going to be an invasion of their privacy [noise] 

562.94 564.87 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

565.37 569.05 B: it's definitely just a matter of per- perception and experience so no 

569.61 572.46 A: yeah i mean my 

572.67 577.33 A: my thing about that is because drugs are illegal 

578.09 580.64 A: [lipsmack] um at least for the time being 

580.16 581.46 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

580.77 583.72 A: maybe one of these days it will become legal 

583.69 584.69 B: (( yeah )) 

584.34 590.75 A: um but because it is illegal that companies um 

591.43 592.68 A: (( [lipsmack] can )) 

592.69 596.12 A: and some still do ah ask 

596.64 597.81 A: (( that ah )) 

597.84 599.95 A: (( th- that you go through the dr ))
