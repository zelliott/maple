85.07 86.04 B: (( [noise] um )) 

86.13 89.51 B: i think you know that it is definitely 

89.70 94.53 B: having a serious impact and i you know like i said i think that uh 

95.01 99.65 B: family values are becoming stronger because of it people are reevaluating 

99.70 102.63 B: the way that they're raising their family and [mn] 

104.04 108.12 A: mhm mhm but they're getting like yeah uh-huh 

104.59 107.19 B: what they're teaching their children 

108.23 114.82 A: yeah they getting those kinds of stuff in they getting the kinds of stuff from uh asia and all like um 

114.61 124.96 A: [mn] um for example like in asian parts of continent like we have like uh marriage being arranged where the parents and then [laughter] like uh children getting married 

125.81 136.79 A: of the parents but over here like the uh processes you know it's like dating and then getting married and then so can you comment a little bit on that 

136.06 137.21 B: yeah um 

137.35 139.08 B: oh i think you know 

139.45 143.71 B: that a lot of kids are getting [sigh] married too soon rather than

150.01 151.29 A: (( mhm mhm yeah ))

152.59 154.28 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

156.09 165.78 B: with the family values i was raised with i waited until i was twenty one before i was married and and before i started my family 

162.05 163.22 A: oh okay 

165.53 166.97 A: oh okay that's 

166.28 172.29 B: and i was i was very fortunate and very blessed to have a strong family support

174.57 175.37 A: uh-huh 

175.71 176.46 B: (( so )) 

176.07 180.75 A: so like uh in raising the children like i was growing 

181.09 190.87 A: up in and then like uh i always feel like parental care is much more important to me even when i was a kid and not only even when i was a kid like even when i was growing up 

191.00 204.17 A: um i think like i need my parental uh parents' assistance you know in walks of my life and then like uh do you feel the same or else is it like do you think that you need to have a independent 

204.58 212.55 A: of your own and then should children be left to all to take their own decisions about studies about other things in their life [mn] 

213.01 213.85 B: um 

213.86 214.60 B: it's 

214.45 221.24 B: the way i look at it is that yes they need to be raised to be independent and to be able to think for themselves but 

221.01 233.96 B: i also feel v- very strongly you know like i said i was very blessed and very fortunate to have a very strong family support where we raised to be able to think for ourselves but to be able 

226.45 229.01 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

229.87 231.67 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

233.95 242.74 B: to openly discuss things with our parents and and learn from the benefit of their wisdom and and their advice and

245.12 251.15 B: very best friend next to my husband and my dad's right behind her you know so i'm 

250.23 251.42 A: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

251.94 257.63 A: so uh like this is just a curious question are you a christian by faith or something

257.36 258.15 B: um 

258.35 262.40 B: i [mn] i've been raised christian but i've 

262.98 263.99 B: been 

264.21 267.40 B: kind of searching for what really fits me 

267.09 268.58 A: mhm 

267.51 280.80 B: i haven't you know i like i said i was raised christian so i ha- of course have some of the christian beliefs but there there are other things out there i feel that christianity does not completely consider 

273.65 274.67 A: oh okay 

280.92 282.46 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

280.94 284.88 B: and [mn] just searching for answers 

284.19 291.01 A: so like do you think that some kind of religious beliefs can have some impact on these family values 

291.11 294.95 B: yes i do i really do um a lot of 

292.30 294.18 A: yeah okay yeah 

295.21 300.96 B: a lot of different versions of christianity whether it's baptist or or whatever 

298.87 301.38 A: mhm right 

301.00 305.32 B: e- emphasize that you god first family second [noise] 

302.82 303.76 A: mhm 

305.24 306.23 A: mhm 

305.50 306.37 B: and 

306.89 312.18 B: [mn] you know that that really does emphasize the family values i feel because [mn] 

307.76 309.82 A: yeah yeah 

310.59 311.58 A: yeah 

311.61 314.07 A: (( so [mn] yeah go ahead uh-huh )) 

313.42 326.47 B: sorry it it teaches you to you know put your family first make them a a very high priority on your list and watch what you're teaching them and be involved with them 

321.44 323.19 A: mhm 

324.63 325.64 A: (( oh okay )) 

326.48 330.04 B: and and be aware of what's going on in their lives 

326.57 327.82 A: yeah 

329.62 341.12 A: mhm so like if the is there like any society like i definitely feel that the society has a lot of role to play in this fam- ending of the family values 

341.13 350.92 A: um as a part of society like how do you think like is a society going to influence the persons uh family values and the surrounding 

351.25 352.09 A: (( as )) 

352.60 357.70 A: so that they could could go for the best values of the society 

357.43 368.07 B: um i feel that society does play a big part on it and that it's you know each family of course has to make their own decisions as to what emphasis they're going to allow it to play in their lives 

367.86 369.04 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

368.12 370.81 B: um i try really hard to 

370.87 375.31 B: monitor what my kids watch and and you know kind of 

375.04 376.49 A: yeah 

375.88 379.72 B: teach 'em family values by what they're allowed to watch um 

378.80 380.44 A: yeah 

381.44 389.73 A: and um i feel like uh the more educated the people are like then they are more uh dignified and then they have like 

381.85 382.41 B: (( [mn] )) 

389.56 401.90 A: uh good family values and uh they care about the parents and also do you accept my [laughter] uh way of thinking or do you have something to say on that 

402.25 404.20 B: yeah i i agree with you 

402.44 407.78 A: like i mean like higher education or like do you think like education has any role at all mhm

412.39 415.56 B: you know those people who have less 

413.51 414.56 A: yeah 

415.82 421.19 B: education or who really have to struggle with it i feel tend to you know

503.81 515.83 B: [mn] yeah i'm i've been looking into starting some classes again here at the local college so that way i can continue to improve my education and you know to get a break from the kids every once in a [laughter] while 

511.76 513.45 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

514.29 527.62 A: yeah [laughter] yeah so like uh i got i do a lot of and then i i feel like when i'm going around like learning a lot of different cultures meeting a lot of different people so i feel like 

515.96 516.74 B: but 

527.60 537.87 A: uh definitely it's uh something that we should learn from everyone and then so that probably even when it can be applied to this uh situation of this family values i guess 

537.94 548.20 A: like when you go out and learn something and then you feel that it might be good and then you can implement in your own way of life um is it true oh 

550.40 551.60 B: yeah um 

554.11 557.39 B: sorry [laughter] handing off the baby [laughter] so

556.77 558.06 A: yeah it's okay 

557.57 565.53 B: i no i i agree um you know and the education and the family values i think the more the 

559.68 561.89 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

565.62 569.10 B: as the country returns more to a family value base 

569.45 573.95 B: societies that it it'll actually strengthen the country too you 

573.40 574.95 A: (( mhm mhm yeah )) 

574.06 576.00 B: know it it'll be more 

576.22 578.06 B: become more unified 

577.86 587.61 A: yeah you are right yeah i i do think personally like when you start bringing up a reform in a society from a grass root level i mean like from the family based level 

578.19 579.04 B: um 

587.46 597.61 A: i think that as a wholly it's going to reflect in a society and then through that uh a country can become so strong in their [mn] values and all 

587.65 588.34 B: (( mhm )) 

597.81 598.83 A: right 

598.90 599.89 B: yeah
