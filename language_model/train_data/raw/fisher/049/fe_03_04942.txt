1.00 2.23 A: hello 

2.04 4.00 B: hello this is francis 

3.63 5.11 A: hi this is dennis 

5.01 6.24 B: how you doing 

5.45 7.10 A: pretty good how are you today 

7.05 9.06 B: pretty good 

8.58 9.50 A: [mn] 

9.59 14.73 A: i didn't quite get all of what she said about this what are we supposed to be talking about 

13.75 21.22 B: i believe the topic was censorship and whether public and private schools have the right to forbid or require the reading of certain books 

20.64 21.95 A: (( oh okay )) 

23.18 24.61 A: (( [mn] [cough] )) 

25.85 26.82 A: excuse me 

27.56 29.53 B: which i have no problem with 

28.98 30.22 A: i don't either 

30.40 31.55 A: (( you know 'cause )) 

31.64 33.87 A: they can't let 'em just read whatever they want 

33.85 38.70 B: (( right )) 

34.32 43.45 A: you know and then there's certain books in the curriculum of every school they have to read so to a point they are forcing 'em to read certain books and 

40.49 43.54 B: (( right )) 

43.61 51.08 B: well you know there's a certain standard that you're looking for you want them to learn from stuff that is better than others 

47.06 48.86 A: yeah 

51.39 56.06 B: you know so you you you know you would put take for example you would place shakespeare 

56.44 60.80 B: a lot higher in the ranking than say you know judy collins 

60.89 65.37 B: you know or something along those lines at the same time you know you 

64.48 67.58 A: (( yeah )) 

65.74 66.69 B: uh 

67.11 69.59 B: you know you don't want a student giving a uh 

69.67 72.21 B: approving presentation on mein kampf 

72.25 74.16 A: yeah 

73.00 74.91 B: you know that would kind of be uh 

75.24 81.02 B: ignorant [laughter] to say the least so of course you would you would forbid certain things 

76.56 79.08 A: yeah and then 

80.59 83.73 A: yeah and then on the other hand you don't want 'em doing one on 

84.27 86.88 A: (( i don't know the manson murders )) 

86.88 88.75 B: (( right )) 

87.80 89.36 A: which actually 

90.05 91.42 A: i don't know i guess 

92.60 99.60 A: i thinks that part of our history you know it's psycho crap like that that's happened that kids need to know about 

92.73 94.22 B: (( well )) 

98.42 105.66 B: i wouldn't have any problem with that particular uh i should say with a with an objective third party look at that now if it was his own 

105.92 106.89 B: uh 

107.05 120.13 B: you know skewed and distorted recollection of the affair then that's not something you want them being exposed to because you know some of them are impressionable and or stupid enough to go with something like that 

109.92 112.41 A: (( [mn] [laughter] yeah )) 

116.03 118.70 A: yeah 

121.41 126.55 B: i suppose that there's got to be a standard and a and a and a guideline somewhere 

121.86 122.78 A: [mn] 

125.95 127.72 A: yeah 

127.17 134.22 B: you know a lot of people ju- just i guess the main question that most people have would be where is that standard you know 

133.36 136.03 A: and that's that's the biggest thing 

136.47 139.45 A: i think that one of our problems the nation has is 

139.98 141.37 A: nobody can 

142.18 144.56 A: this person don't want to give uh 

144.62 155.92 A: maybe lower his standards and this person don't think theirs is high enough and they they need to get something where everybody's happy with it but i don't think it'll ever happen because there's too many people that 

155.82 159.21 B: well there's too many people to have a vested interest in a lot of things 

158.64 160.36 A: yeah 

159.46 165.86 B: um you know my whole problem with this is is in the whole political correct movement um 

166.24 170.36 B: you know as far as i'm concerned the history and literature of western civilization 

170.51 172.43 B: is the finest there is 

172.66 182.12 B: and i don't have a problem actually i would encourage it to be taught and expect it for the children to learn if you can't have your children learning you know their history then they uh 

180.38 183.05 A: (( yeah )) 

182.31 185.69 B: how can they continue to thrive as a civilization 

186.23 190.07 B: that can't happen you know if you teach your children that uh 

186.82 187.38 A: [mn] 

187.40 188.25 A: no 

190.88 194.63 B: you know for example if you don't if you teach them nothing about the uh 

195.58 205.28 B: okay let's put it like this the especially with the with the history you know the big thing right now is that uh you know western civilization plac- practice slavery 

204.90 206.70 A: mhm 

205.38 215.64 B: you know well so did every other civilization but western civilization ended it but they don't teach that anymore they don't teach that it ended in the west they only teach that it existed in the west 

211.64 213.47 A: yeah 

215.00 216.70 A: yeah 

216.46 221.94 B: and that's uh you know that in it's own way is a kind of censorship it's a censorship of the truth 

222.29 226.51 B: you know and that's the problem that i have right now is you have all these school boards and 

225.58 228.43 A: (( yeah )) 

226.73 227.67 B: uh 

227.85 232.77 B: you know groups that are [mn] distorting and skewing the way things are 

233.03 235.68 B: the way things are are taught 

235.75 237.97 B: uh you know when you have 

239.27 244.99 B: you know when you have shakespeare censored but yet you're encouraging 

245.26 248.13 B: you know alternative studies in in uh 

249.06 252.86 B: how the west needs to be overthrown i have a problem with that 

254.03 254.97 B: (( you know )) 

254.74 259.00 A: yeah we're not just like uh what was it two year a year ago 

255.61 257.01 B: and that's seems mm 

260.12 266.60 A: i can't remember where i was at i was out in ohio or pennsylvania or something and there's some guy talking on the radio 

266.02 271.83 B: (( yeah )) 

266.56 280.08 A: one of them morning talk show guys and he had people calling in that were saying they didn't believe the holocaust happened with hitler and everything they think it was all propaganda that the governments made up to make germany look or hitler look bad 

280.77 286.02 B: and there's people you know again that goes back to people being impressionable or stupid enough to believe whatever they're fed 

284.61 287.41 A: (( mhm )) 

286.40 291.97 B: you know so when you have people that are that can feed you things like that somebody's gonna believe it sooner or later 

291.85 306.38 A: [mn] yeah and my son's a i got a thirteen year old son and a eighteen year old son and my youngest one was asking me how come they have to learn history and i think the biggest thing they need to learn history for is so we don't repeat ourself down the road 

295.98 302.78 B: (( mhm )) 

307.01 316.06 B: exactly you need to learn exactly what happened so that it can't happen again you know that that's a dark chapter in humanity and it never needs to be repeated 

316.06 322.03 B: you know and there's many dark periods that that don't need to be repeated but that are repeated constantly because 

316.65 318.26 A: yeah 

322.38 325.17 B: you know people aren't taught any differently 

324.79 328.11 A: [mn] yeah and it's i i don't think there's very many 

328.59 335.75 A: i don't know ten thirteen fourteen year old kids in there that understand what happened with the indians in our nati- 

335.79 337.21 A: [cough] in our nation 

337.69 339.38 B: not at all 

338.88 342.95 A: and it just that's one of the other things they don't really teach about 

340.36 340.92 B: (( [mn] )) 

343.53 348.80 B: they don't teach a lot of anything anymore we've actually pulled our daughter from school and we home school now 

343.93 344.53 A: (( [cough] )) 

349.06 349.94 A: really 

349.49 353.90 B: because we we're very unsatisfied with the way the public schools are going 

353.25 354.51 A: yeah 

353.83 365.11 B: and uh you know m- a lot of the private schools are the same [mn] you know the really expensive private schools are better but you know uh we unfortunately can't afford that sort of thing 

365.23 366.15 B: (( you know )) 

365.64 368.29 A: [mn] yeah i just i don't know what happened to our 

369.16 371.93 A: i don't know not our economy but our 

372.29 374.88 A: country in general where 

375.33 384.62 A: you pay somebody one million dollars to make an hour sitcom but yet our teachers aren't making twenty five thirty five thousand dollars a year 

384.83 392.26 A: you know as far as i'm concerned our teachers ought to be the highest paid people working in the united states 

391.78 400.44 B: well the whole reason [mn] that that's not happening is because they don't want qualified teachers they don't want competent teachers 

398.06 399.98 A: mhm 

400.90 404.54 B: you know qualified and competent teachers will teach the children to think 

405.05 409.96 B: you know they don't want children to think they want children to and people to swallow whatever they're given 

410.42 411.78 B: it's all about power 

413.31 416.07 B: you know if you'll accept whatever is given you 

416.13 419.02 B: then the person that's giving it to you has complete power over you 

420.15 424.48 B: you know again go back to the the holocaust thing if 

424.57 425.47 B: (( you know )) 

425.54 436.34 B: if everybody that you've ever looked up to or has taught you has told you that this never happened you're most likely to believe that it never happened and so they have a measure of power that 

430.19 433.39 A: (( yeah )) 

436.43 439.13 B: you know really no one else has 

439.48 442.13 A: yeah and i think that right there 

439.52 440.44 B: (( you know )) 

442.28 448.52 A: about the people you look up look up to your parents or aunts and uncles and older brothers and stuff 

449.70 450.34 A: (( [cough] )) 

450.65 454.04 A: that's one of the problems that they're having with the schools is 

455.24 464.99 A: when a kid comes to school and they tart starts to teach a [mn] kid something like that about the holocaust and and the kid turns around and says well my dad says that never happens 

464.21 466.07 B: mhm 

465.68 473.11 A: the teachers are getting so wishy washy they don't want to push the issue and get in trouble with the parents at home so 

473.52 477.63 A: they're that's how a lot of this stuff is gotten dropped 

477.82 481.26 A: because the a lot of it's to do with racism 

480.96 481.89 B: mhm 

481.36 486.08 A: i don't want my kids learning about them damn people you know or it's however they want to say it i 

486.17 499.68 A: but it's that's part of it that's where it's all going the te- the teachers do not want to take control of the kids while the kids are in the classrooms anymore they'd rather have an argumentative kid and kick him out of the class instead of sitting down 

495.32 496.18 B: (( oh the )) 

499.49 504.80 A: and try to work with them anymore they just said well i don't get paid enough to deal with this you're out of my class 

503.65 504.96 B: (( tea- well there you go )) 

505.01 511.27 B: i'll tell you the the prime motivator why we pulled our daughter from public school she was in first grade 

511.45 515.27 B: and another child threatened to kill her if she didn't give her her snack 

513.33 514.59 A: oh man 

515.69 519.17 B: and the principal treated it as a joke 

519.48 522.72 B: and then wanted to put the two girls into counselling together 

523.05 534.09 B: my daughter doesn't need counselling you know this child doesn't need to be in school that's what that is you know now in this day and age children do that sort of thing they don't just say it 

523.44 524.00 A: (( [mn] )) 

527.96 529.74 A: yeah 

533.98 536.04 A: yeah 

534.34 547.05 B: that's the problem you know and so now the principal is only worried about the other child's rights and i said well let me explain something to you if you look at amendment one to the constitution 

541.10 542.08 A: uh-huh 

547.83 558.16 B: we have the right to freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom to petition the government for redress or grievances which means i'll have every news media you've ever thought of down here 

558.74 563.01 B: and i'll have you in federal court and that'll be the end of this 

561.32 562.26 A: where you 

562.48 564.14 A: yeah where you from 

564.02 566.23 B: uh we live in alabama right now 

565.86 566.74 A: okay 

567.36 570.27 A: i'm in lincoln nebraska 

570.16 571.46 B: and uh 

571.92 574.40 B: you know so we we pulled her from school 

574.48 581.03 B: you know she was worried about the other child's rights basically she was worried about getting sued if she disciplined the other child 

580.41 582.22 A: yeah 

581.09 583.54 B: well you know i've got the 

583.81 586.53 B: you know i've got your policies right here in front of you 

587.08 593.98 B: okay your policies say if this happens this is the punishment and you're unwilling to go by that i'm sorry i got no use for you 

594.63 595.48 A: mhm 

594.67 597.78 B: you know you have shown absolutely no backbone 

598.38 599.89 B: you know the other problem is
