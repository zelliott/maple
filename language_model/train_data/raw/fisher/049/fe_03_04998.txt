95.74 96.74 B: (( yeah )) 

95.89 109.99 A: and just recently were told that i might have some cardiac problem but it's a funny thing because i had decided [noise] to start working out again and um you know i i had a a a [noise] personal trainer 

110.02 124.18 A: but uh they told me [noise] well they wouldn't do it until they got a a a doctor's okay to go ahead and a- and start training with it um but um it was funny 'cause i went there and i 

124.28 131.58 A: told 'em i had some some chest pains and he he well he wasn't okay but put me in the hospital and i went through all that but it [noise] 

131.70 140.05 A: there wasn't nothing to it it was [sigh] it was we were kind of stupid really to even go to go through it but that has been my um 

140.25 150.20 A: [noise] my uh outlook i was gonna go back um and uh train again i wanted something you know that i hadn't had when i was in high school 

150.24 152.92 A: um i never played uh 

152.93 161.43 A: uh basketball or anything like that never got into that uh football a little bit but i never played for a school team 

161.51 170.89 A: but i was on the wrestling team and i was on the varsity wrestling team when i was a pre- a freshman and i got a letter that year a varsity letter 

163.82 164.85 B: (( yeah okay )) 

165.96 166.52 B: (( [cough] )) 

170.14 171.39 B: right 

170.89 175.40 A: so like i'm a varsity a senior varsity letterman and i'm only a freshman 

175.35 186.23 A: you know so uh uh but i did i did uh uh good with that and [noise] uh uh practiced the martial arts for a while and whatnot but i don't know you know it just kinda [sigh] 

186.34 193.02 A: i kinda just kinda just just fell back on it you know and then after getting married and having kids and stuff that just 

192.93 195.18 B: oh yeah man yeah 

194.28 196.59 A: that'll do it [laughter] you know u- 

195.79 206.83 B: i believe that i mean i don't have children but being a teacher man kids are kids are so attention needing and i mean especially between one to ten 

199.26 200.26 A: uh-huh 

206.47 207.75 A: right 

207.13 208.45 B: (( it's like )) 

208.59 212.71 B: (( you i mean from birth to ten really y- i mean )) 

211.51 213.55 A: right right [noise] 

212.70 219.20 B: there's so much attention need that they need and so many things that you wanna do with them so they could be on the right track 

218.63 220.40 A: right right 

219.18 234.18 B: 'cause i'm teaching like um you get a lot of kids that are that don't have a good self esteem by the main of good good amount of times it's because they're not really in the physical shape that they should be 

233.71 235.28 A: right right right 

234.33 248.90 B: and a lot of that has to do with um the type of foods they're eating not necessarily um that they're eating junk it's just because when they're in low income areas a lot of times they give them they give 'em 

237.97 238.98 A: right 

244.70 245.81 A: right 

248.90 258.87 B: subsidized food that has steroids in it that fills you up that fills you up and is and is not really good for you but it's something that they give you to 

251.34 252.71 A: [noise] right right 

253.04 254.32 A: right 

257.90 260.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] right right )) 

259.98 261.97 B: type of meal so it's 

260.85 273.77 A: no i kn- i know about it [noise] 'cause um i i came up in the um inner city of chicago and uh uh [noise] it was quite a it was quite a thing most of the kids there 

267.31 268.29 B: okay 

273.79 280.75 A: um when i got well after i got grown and had had kids my oldest son 

280.75 293.66 A: um he got into martial arts and he of course he went he went a lot f- further than i did and whatnot he had a he had competed with the a._k._a. and stuff and he's he's won a few 

293.65 306.88 A: a few championships and whatnot in his division but he wa- uh uh but [noise] the teacher that taught him was a guy that i mean [noise] came from the ghetto but he his name was harold barage 

307.23 309.14 A: (( they used to call him the scorpion )) 

309.12 319.43 A: and uh he's he was it as far as as far as uh tournament sparring and whatnot is concerned but a- all the kids in his class 

319.41 325.59 A: his classes were you know really street kids i mean kids that didn't have like you said proper 

326.03 331.45 A: nutrition you know uh um they had to fight to go to school and fight to come back 

331.46 342.66 A: and uh um uh it was really something to see how he did 'em because a lot of 'em were undisciplined but he disciplined 'em good uh to the point where they could um 

342.55 352.29 A: [noise] win a tournament and win other things like a lot of 'em went on to do other things some went to college and whatnot like that but for me personally i've thought about going back 

352.36 355.68 A: into martial arts uh i still do 

355.62 368.78 A: uh but they'll tell you you know once you hit fifty you know everything is supposed to uh change or so but um for me right now i wanna i i w- wanna go back i wanna 

363.20 364.48 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

368.65 380.64 A: you know when i keep hearing folks for all the years i hear folks saying well you know you gotta have a um a six pack and all that i say you all don't know what you're talking about it ain't a six it's a eight 

380.61 383.92 A: you know [laughter] that's what i want you know 

380.72 381.87 B: (( yeah )) 

383.83 395.79 A: that's what i want i want a eight and i intend to do it you know i'm gonna do it some way shape or form uh uh i think i just gotta just trim down it was funny 'cause i had lost weight 

395.75 401.88 A: last year and i gained it right back uh this year so i'm gonna try to lose um 

402.25 414.73 A: lose about another forty probably lose about forty pounds which'll put me right you know below two hundred and right back you know at the right weight for my height but um yeah i did 

412.48 413.50 B: right 

414.68 418.05 A: you know i i thought about it you know and whatnot it's just 

418.11 422.89 A: you know i the only thing i could say to a lot of guys or whatnot you know is 

423.00 427.64 A: is just try to stick on it and don't don't let it go 'cause 

427.98 435.48 A: if you let it go man i ain't lying later on it's gonna creep back on you and you ain't gonna like what you see 

434.81 446.15 B: right and the key age i mean 'cause really when you're in you're twenties it really don't matter what you do but um once you probably get over like thirty or whatever that's when it really starts because 

440.18 441.51 A: right 

443.36 444.67 A: right 

445.96 459.77 B: everything starts filling out and you start getting weight where you never even thought but really it starts as you're a kid though starts as you're a kid and really what's going on at school of today is sad as far as i 

450.42 451.62 A: that's right 

453.90 454.98 A: yeah 

459.49 461.33 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

460.46 472.22 B: physed and uh things like that are being phased out of the schools and um i mean physed once a week man that was unheard of when i was a kid and i mean and i'm not even that old 

463.90 466.23 A: mhm yeah
