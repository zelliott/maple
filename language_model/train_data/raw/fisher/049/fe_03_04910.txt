0.76 2.27 A: (( [mn] hello )) 

2.17 3.54 B: (( hey how you doing )) 

3.56 5.47 A: what's going on my name is danny 

5.40 8.53 B: hey danny i'm frank where you calling from 

7.62 8.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

8.30 10.66 A: uh studio city california 

10.61 12.46 B: oh okay i'm in uh 

12.57 14.14 B: in orange county 

14.00 15.37 A: orange county 

15.00 16.29 B: yeah 

16.37 20.37 A: all right um so we're supposed to talk about drug testing i guess 

20.26 22.78 B: yeah have you ever had that done 

22.60 24.44 A: no i have not 

24.41 26.92 B: no what they do now yeah they 

24.58 25.71 A: (( how about yourself )) 

26.95 29.34 B: i've had to apply for some jobs 

29.42 31.18 B: where they require 

31.56 35.64 B: um different kinds of drug tests now one of the most recent 

36.22 40.11 B: [mn] that i've heard of is they uh take hair samples 

40.46 44.34 B: and then they uh analyze the hair and determine 

44.65 54.52 B: whether you have used any kind of drugs or pot or whatever and even alcohol 'cause it stays in the hair longer yeah and um 

50.59 51.64 A: oh really 

54.69 61.47 B: i've had that so they had to shave my arms they weren't gonna touch my legs i said you ain't touching my legs [laughter] 

60.35 62.14 A: uh-huh yeah i guess 

62.71 64.06 A: so they can do it to 

62.72 63.83 B: or they can take 

64.23 67.05 A: they can do it through hair samples oh that that's interesting 

66.37 68.72 B: yeah they get it through hair samples now 

68.80 83.70 A: you know like uh you know what the the span is as far as like how long that lasts like you i know with urine it's like you have to wait like a month or or whatnot but i've never heard it even done with like hair samples like 

68.81 69.94 B: and uh it 

84.00 89.21 A: how how long does it does it take like uh to clear out of your blood stream i guess 

87.48 88.29 B: (( can )) 

88.38 91.98 B: it'll stay in your hair for about a year 

92.17 103.63 B: depending on yeah 'cause i asked the um physician when i had the drug test done and asked her questions about it she said it stays in your hair follicle 

92.52 93.68 A: oh really 

103.85 108.36 B: and in the hair strand for up to a year depending on the kind of drug 

108.21 110.48 A: (( mm )) 

108.48 112.91 B: and one of the most common that they're finding are uh for pot 

112.98 115.74 B: it stays in your hair a lot longer than urine 

116.57 118.00 B: so obviously 

116.66 118.01 A: that's interesting 

118.02 120.25 B: yeah so i thought well that's 

120.70 122.68 B: you know i mean if somebody 

123.17 126.31 B: who is you know just a total stoner 

126.53 139.39 B: they're probably not gonna be applying for you know kinds of jobs anyway that are gonna require a level of intelligence [laughter] you know i mean i i shouldn't say that in that regard but um most people i 

133.62 134.57 A: (( mhm )) 

139.53 148.17 B: found out were disqualified for the job because they had smoked pot or whatever and it's like well geeze maybe they had it 

148.26 152.11 B: you know six months ago maybe up to a year you know just 

152.13 153.77 B: (( casually )) 

153.89 157.18 B: you know smoking pot and know they couldn't get a job 

157.33 158.51 A: mhm 

158.30 159.90 B: but then uh 

160.31 162.46 B: i guess other [noise] 

162.52 170.28 B: yeah and then but i guess other reasons why they wouldn't wanna hire because you might be in a position where you might need to be thinking clearly or something 

170.15 171.34 A: yeah that's true 

170.64 179.88 B: and not be influenced so what do you do what do you do or what have you what kind of job have you applied for where you had to have a drug test 

179.33 183.99 A: i've actually i've never applied for a job where i've had to have a drug test so 

184.01 190.71 A: um yeah i mean i mean i've never had to do that but um i'm sure i i will in the future but 

184.11 185.60 B: oh okay 

190.39 191.77 B: yeah 

191.70 198.09 A: it's just it's kind of it's kind of interesting because you know i'm i'm still young i'm like nineteen so i mean i i go to 

196.92 198.05 B: (( oh okay )) 

197.98 211.40 A: i go go to parties and whatnot and you know that stuff that stuff's just there i mean i'm not a not a pothead or anything but you know you just you're you're just around it just just being alive just being a teenager no matter what it's just everywhere you go especially in california 

204.18 205.23 B: (( yeah )) 

210.48 211.51 B: yeah 

211.83 214.92 A: so i mean i mean that's kind of 

214.70 228.31 A: it's kind of a a weird concept kinda weird to think about that it stays in you know your system for a year after that you know if if i wanted to go apply for a job tomorrow where i had to go get drug test i i probably wouldn't get the job so 

227.98 229.06 B: yeah 

229.34 234.05 B: and it's um i think it's got to the point too where 

234.09 236.98 B: most of the jobs that do require that are 

237.16 241.76 B: um 'cause the only time i had to have that done was when i applied for a job doing 

242.45 245.28 B: car sales you know just working in car sales 

245.25 246.17 A: mhm 

245.39 251.52 B: and you think you know just selling cars that you're talking about dealing with you know people's money 

251.55 257.47 B: and pro- personal property and property that belongs to you know the dealer 

251.59 252.45 A: yeah 

252.72 253.54 A: true 

257.91 263.23 B: it could be you know working with thousands of dollars of property or assets that 

263.58 268.56 B: you know people just have a tendency to get greedy or they get tempted by 

269.41 271.55 B: and i've seen it happen kind of so 

271.93 274.98 B: not in car sales but in other companies 

275.50 281.74 B: and it's like they have to do that now just for their own protection their own protection of their assets 

275.75 276.65 A: (( uh-huh )) 

281.61 282.87 A: yeah i guess 

283.16 284.00 A: huh 

284.18 285.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

286.03 288.31 A: it's a very interesting concept 

288.04 292.09 B: yeah yeah it is now have you had any um 

293.32 294.87 B: what do you what do you do 

295.36 296.35 B: for a living 

295.53 306.41 A: ah well i'm not i'm a studio drummer right i ah play the drums and for for studios and stuff like that and for different bands but i also work in a restaurant on the weekends 

302.92 304.08 B: (( oh okay )) 

304.14 305.17 B: oh wow 

306.36 307.46 B: (( oh okay )) 

306.46 307.25 A: but 

308.04 311.43 A: yeah i mean i've nev- i've never i don't think i'll 

311.45 318.16 A: well i probably won't have to ever deal with a drug test unless it's you know something that has to do with the law or anything like that but 

317.74 318.83 B: yeah 

318.19 329.04 A: no if i ever wanted to get like a like a summer job or anything working at the you know like through the government or like maybe at a post office i'm sure i'd have to have that done so 

327.07 328.45 B: yeah you do 

329.25 330.96 B: yes if you ever plan on 

331.40 333.73 B: having a a career 

334.05 346.36 B: with law enforcement health departments government oh even the government in city offices where i've applied they required uh drug testing they would tell you right upfront you're gonna have to 

346.55 352.04 B: um even before you apply they make you sign a waiver are you gonna be able to pass pass a drug test 

352.46 355.57 B: and you know you have to say yes or no of course 

352.77 354.08 A: (( mm )) 

355.88 358.41 B: you submit your application with that 

358.43 359.58 B: and 

359.77 367.62 B: um then they check your background before they even hire you before they even call you for an interview in some cases now companies will check your background 

367.70 370.07 B: which i've had that done a couple times 

370.30 375.87 B: so did you go through college if you ever do or start looking for jobs and as you get older 

375.97 378.75 B: be aware of that 'cause it's not gonna get any 

378.76 380.93 B: len- more lenient 

380.31 381.81 A: oh i know yeah 

381.41 383.55 B: it's gonna keep getting more 

383.67 388.85 B: um i guess you know like like privacy they're saying that you know they're 

389.14 391.19 B: it's it sounds like they're 

391.49 397.67 B: they're trying to just cover their own bases but then yeah it infringes on your personal life 

397.79 398.65 A: mhm 

397.84 405.03 B: but i mean i used i used to smoke pot and do drugs and back then they only had the only thing they had was a lie detector test 

405.09 410.82 B: and you could go oh ha you could i've had to do a couple lie detector tests just for applying for jobs 

405.09 406.16 A: oh really 

410.86 413.19 B: years ago i mean twenty years ago 

413.22 414.06 A: uh-huh 

413.46 417.78 B: and now they don't even do that it's more for like when you're in 

418.06 421.84 B: you know when you're in jail or something you know [laughter] or you're in prison 

421.72 422.90 A: yeah 

422.18 426.91 B: and uh they say that those aren't even accurate now because people can kinda control their 

427.26 431.79 B: emotions so that they can pass it uh a lie detector test 

431.28 433.15 A: yeah well 

432.32 434.40 B: so it does kind of infringe on 

434.44 435.81 B: privacy 

436.01 441.10 A: yeah definitely and and since they're you know they're getting a lot more advanced like uh 

438.97 439.70 B: (( [noise] )) 

440.94 451.10 A: i i remember just just last year i mean they only used to do it through urine samples and stuff like that but i guess kids found so many different ways to you know overcome that you can 

446.03 446.97 B: uh-huh 

450.89 465.40 A: there's so many places you can call and you know get get fake urine and stuff like that that you can use for for drug tests oh yeah that's that's all over the place so i mean i i mean this is the first time i've actually heard it done through you know samples of hair so i mean 

456.48 458.70 B: (( oh really yes i didn't know that )) 

460.15 461.12 B: (( yeah )) 

465.05 466.07 B: yeah 

465.42 472.65 A: they're just they're just getting more and more advanced and i don't don't really know if there's a way you can get around that the whole hair issue so 

471.18 476.35 B: no you can't get around your hair follicles no yeah they they go right down to the they 

476.36 478.55 B: they don't pull it out they just shave it 

479.02 484.72 B: and um yeah they say it stays in your system it's in your hair follicle the strand for about a year 

484.81 493.48 B: but uh the last time i did that or actually it was the first time when i went to go apply for that job at the car sale dealership i was like well i'm glad i haven't done anything that 

493.54 494.54 A: [laughter] 

494.06 501.75 B: you know would make me fail it 'cause i did do that i mean i did get the job and everything but i didn't end up staying in car sales i'm doing something totally different 

501.64 502.80 A: yeah 

504.15 505.63 A: (( yeah )) 

505.80 508.19 B: so how'd you how'd you hear about this thing 

508.10 515.32 A: mm uh just through through one of my friends one of my friends sent me an email just telling me about it so i decided i'd try it out 

513.71 514.60 B: uh-huh 

515.94 525.95 B: yeah i checked it out on the internet and it seems seems pretty legit to me so i it's got a government grant or something like that for to yeah it's working through the government to do this study 

522.46 523.45 A: oh really 

526.34 527.44 A: (( is it is is it is )) 

527.93 529.81 A: this the first time you've done it or 

529.56 533.95 B: yeah this is the first call i've had about five calls come in but they've been at 

534.03 547.33 B: at the most inopportune times where you know i'm just hanging out with my family or friends or i'm somewhere where you know the phone rings i'm you know talking to a group of people it's like i can't just pick up the phone and say excuse me i don't want to look like a a yuppie but 

538.87 539.89 A: (( mhm )) 

547.96 549.05 A: yeah 

548.81 556.56 B: i just had this is the first one out of five so i didn't think they were gonna call me any more because it had been pretty frequently i was getting calls like every other day 

556.91 563.92 B: um about this time and then um so i'm just sitting chilling out at home right at the same time the others have come in 

564.47 565.76 B: so when when 

564.66 565.51 A: you know if 

565.90 569.58 B: when you get the call does it come from a computer and then you 

569.71 572.74 B: you're hanging on the line waiting is that 

573.05 575.31 B: how you got through to me oh okay 

573.26 580.74 A: yeah it yeah it's like like voice operator and and then they wait and connect you with someone else i guess 

579.54 580.52 B: (( okay oh )) 

580.70 582.00 B: (( okay )) 

582.54 586.56 B: well i guess uh what does it do then 'cause is this your first time you've done it 

586.41 587.47 A: yes 

587.37 593.66 B: yeah okay think i i guess it's gonna time out at about another minute or so 

588.37 590.06 A: so i don't i don't know 

593.92 595.12 B: so um 

595.28 597.62 B: yeah keep in mind don't do any drugs
