101.09 102.22 A: yeah 

104.38 109.59 A: yeah that that that happened to me 'cause when i moved to uh new york to to take this job 

109.76 116.16 A: which i didn't stay in very long 'cause i didn't like it [laughter] which is ironic right you know they wanted it to keep me out 

112.30 113.41 B: okay 

114.20 115.67 B: really it is 

116.31 129.18 A: and uh i remember i i i was you know smoking weed up till four days before the test and uh 'cause my attitude was hey you know what if if if that's gonna be the deciding factor then screw you you know 

128.96 130.15 B: yeah 

129.53 134.96 A: um but then i drank that liquid wha- i i forget what it was called it was kinda nasty 

134.87 136.90 B: (( oh yeah was it yellow )) 

136.71 145.31 A: um no but they had different flavors so it could be the same stuff and it was uh it did funny things to your stomach and then uh 

139.94 141.09 B: okay 

145.49 147.84 A: but it worked i guess [laughter] 

146.52 150.92 B: you had to drink it like a bottle and a half of the water ah water after it 

150.28 151.57 A: yeah 

151.14 153.58 B: yeah i think might of take the same thing [laughter] 

152.56 155.51 A: yeah yeah it was like twenty bucks but it was it was 

154.20 156.24 B: yeah it was worth 

155.69 157.47 A: it was well spent yeah 

156.88 159.83 B: (( it yeah )) 

159.21 160.58 A: oh no 

160.60 165.76 B: bu- bu- beat the court system to my drug test they gave me some day we tried the test is 

165.33 166.79 A: oh wow 

165.98 170.02 B: just just take the medic- the um the um the stuff 

169.47 170.89 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

170.30 173.63 B: (( they said you it works in your system for up to eight hours )) 

173.34 174.55 A: right 

174.52 179.55 B: (( so and then this is always a way to beat a drug test you know what you call what do you calling what you do )) 

179.18 180.40 A: mhm 

180.76 184.05 B: okay if if um like that marijuana 

183.69 184.63 A: uh-huh 

184.61 186.32 B: (( it really worked )) 

185.70 195.77 A: yeah yeah well that's all i uh i really do is so and in fact i don't even really do it any more it's just that back then i was doing it all the time and i was like hey you know what that's part of my lifestyle so 

191.79 192.72 B: yeah 

195.55 196.65 B: yeah 

195.96 204.73 A: um and i feel like you know i mean it's it's really not relevant to to what you're doing on the job i mean again if if they can't evaluate you on the job 

204.95 209.09 A: then you know i mean unless they're gonna pay me for my off hours too 

209.78 211.15 A: you know but 

210.73 213.76 B: (( i think it rather than working though )) 

214.62 218.35 B: (( when i work you know kinda know )) 

218.36 220.93 B: out the mind 

220.40 224.98 A: well i mean again i i don't think it's fair i mean 

225.07 226.24 A: so they're 

226.26 233.28 A: i mean if they're out of their mind on the job you're gonna notice it you know and and that should be the job of their supervisors to 

233.47 238.33 A: to weed them out you know and and fire them if they're on drugs at at work but i mean 

238.30 247.90 A: um these tests also indicate i mean they they test positive even if you're smoking in your you know on your own uh time so yeah and also 

247.28 249.06 B: (( yeah it )) 

247.86 258.27 A: that's the unfair part i don't mind them you know if they can find a way just to test me for you know what i'm doing at that moment i don't care but it always seems to to reach into your private life too much 

257.58 260.23 B: (( works like a double edge sword )) 

260.15 264.39 A: yeah well it i mean it i don't think it's very fair but you know 

264.44 267.91 A: it seems like this society is getting more and more like 

268.07 270.97 A: collecting more and more information on each person 

270.68 272.62 B: (( yes it is )) 

271.85 280.00 A: and so i mean i i think it's dangerous that's why i i mean i think we have to draw the line somewhere so i i would say i disagree with it 

280.84 282.85 B: definitely an idea for 

282.92 284.23 A: yeah 

283.69 287.92 B: guess where i takes in my own time smoking over days it 

287.93 292.35 B: got well it was for trying to work perform that job 

292.06 293.04 A: uh-huh 

293.01 297.26 B: (( not yeah they're for cap our capacity to think clearly )) 

296.84 297.88 A: mhm 

297.65 300.86 B: (( you thinking mind is clogged well that )) 

300.29 311.28 A: well that that's true that's true but i still think that that's the job of the uh the people supervising you to say hey you know you're not you're not doing a good job therefore we're firing you you know 

306.72 308.25 B: yeah that's true 

311.53 320.76 A: but unless you're using drugs on the job i mean i don't know but i i agree i mean that that's that's one reason why i don't do it any more really is because 

321.19 323.31 A: i wasn't as sharp as i could be 

322.89 324.22 B: yeah 

323.58 326.70 A: so i mean that was but that was a personal decision so 

327.30 330.02 B: (( so you think you did you have some before you go to work )) 

330.08 331.03 B: (( so )) 

331.39 333.99 A: oh i i didn't do that [laughter] 

331.47 332.40 B: (( hm )) 

333.91 336.37 B: no no lot of people they do do that though 

335.89 339.92 A: yeah yeah i know i know but uh oh definitely i mean 

339.95 344.88 A: i used to work at a caf at a starbucks and everybody was on drugs it's a 

344.87 347.71 B: (( okay all right )) 

345.66 352.47 A: [laughter] and i wasn't you know i was like one of the few people that would just 'cause i mean i find it just makes time go too slow 

353.18 354.52 B: really 

353.91 355.19 A: yeah 

354.74 359.41 B: and some people perform better it's surprising some people i know for perform better when 

359.18 360.14 A: really 

359.57 361.37 B: (( they're high yeah )) 

360.77 361.71 A: huh 

361.65 364.50 B: and was one i would smoke marijuana 

364.05 364.97 A: uh-huh 

364.78 369.54 B: (( you can't trust they didn't trust them though if perform better they )) 

369.61 370.53 B: (( high )) 

370.29 372.39 A: perform better at what 

372.02 373.10 B: of his job 

373.06 374.05 A: uh-huh 

373.86 375.98 B: wor- wor- working around um 

377.19 378.15 A: uh-huh 

378.36 382.11 B: (( it was like mellowing him out )) 

381.52 382.91 A: (( right mhm )) 

383.26 388.88 B: (( saying that though he got and that's why he did like that )) 

389.02 395.73 A: yeah yeah no i mean that you know i know people who who are constantly all day every day 

390.32 391.65 B: [laughter] 

395.82 396.90 B: yeah 

396.29 404.69 A: and it's just you know they act like that that it's just for fun but if you do it that much you obviously don't have control over yourself 

404.11 405.75 B: oh you addicted there's 

405.07 408.07 A: yeah yeah so 

407.44 410.77 B: drugs that can addictive to anyone like cigarettes 

410.60 414.66 A: oh god don't talk to me about cigarettes i quit those a while back but 

413.76 416.02 B: (( oh well i'm still smoking )) 

415.45 416.82 A: oh really 

416.24 421.73 B: yeah i quit like oh six months and went back 

421.57 426.12 A: yeah oh god i i don't know how i stayed off [laughter] 

425.69 426.64 B: okay 

426.34 430.31 A: well i was seeing them as a drug and i felt like a little pathetic baby you know 

428.53 429.24 B: yeah 

429.77 431.66 B: they are like a drug 

431.07 438.65 A: yeah so i basically decided that you know like it's really just a matter of those times 

438.69 443.57 A: that little two or three minute period where you feel depressed or you feel edgy 

443.90 445.58 A: and you like 

445.61 449.65 A: i need a cigarette and if during those times you can tell yourself 

450.01 459.59 A: well i feel like i feel like crap right now but that's normal that's a normal condition of life the abnormal thing to do is to try to control your mood you know what i mean 

459.47 468.18 A: by taking a drug so that's that's ultimately the only thing that worked for me was to realize sometimes you have to feel like crap 

461.04 462.16 B: yeah 

467.87 470.51 B: (( or do you go through what you have to go through it )) 

469.89 474.00 A: yeah and and exactly and then once i accepted that feeling 

474.06 485.15 A: every time it would happen it'd be like okay i'm just gonna feel crappy right now in two minutes i'd feel better you know it's just a matter of telling yourself okay cigarettes are not available to me any more you know 

485.95 487.23 A: but um 

488.42 495.16 A: yeah that's that is serious that is a very serious addiction i was really addicted i used to smoke over a pack a day 

495.78 497.67 B: does me a day too [laughter] 

497.20 501.44 A: yeah yeah yeah so i knew i had to quit i mean there was no question so 

501.50 503.13 A: thank god i quit 

502.74 508.43 B: i believe they basically test you to find stuff first time when you apply for the job no matter what the job is 

508.51 510.87 A: you think they should get tested for any job 

510.55 511.87 B: yes 

512.23 513.31 A: wow 

512.94 513.99 B: i do 

514.39 515.83 A: why is that 

517.38 523.59 B: 'cause i 'cause i won't a bust for nobody or really on the streets somebody's all high of their mind you 

523.22 524.25 A: uh-huh 

524.70 531.03 B: know can control itself at what they doing and judging my life 'cause if there was 

531.30 533.56 B: (( to a bust going on )) 

533.41 534.80 A: yeah but i mean 

535.41 539.87 A: so i mean i don't you think it should depend on what job they have 

539.93 542.49 B: (( no basically any job )) 

542.61 545.24 B: (( every single person the person in the job )) 

546.36 547.19 A: huh 

547.52 549.20 B: yeah 

548.83 549.87 A: wow 

549.30 551.42 B: it's just where you and i differ 

551.47 555.56 A: right yeah oh definitely definitely but well 

554.97 557.64 B: yeah everybody should be tested 

557.40 558.40 A: uh-huh 

558.18 565.25 B: (( you look at at combination of drugs they use you become very dangerous to everyone else but not them )) 

561.11 561.96 A: right 

564.17 567.46 A: so you're totally clean now if you have that opinion right 

567.39 570.18 B: (( wholly clean clean no )) 

568.66 569.58 A: yeah 

570.50 573.36 A: so that's kinda hypocritical [laughter] right i mean 

572.43 573.32 B: (( mm )) 

573.87 575.24 A: to say 

574.29 576.11 B: (( you see i'm not working though )) 

575.67 577.35 A: oh okay yeah but 

576.38 580.89 B: i'm not i'm not working no driving controlling a vehicle or nothing 

580.28 584.17 A: yeah but i mean what if you're working in an office you still think that that person should 

583.47 587.56 B: no there's often no i was working then no of course not 

587.03 592.80 A: oh okay then we agree i'm really only talking about jobs where people can hurt other people 

588.76 590.36 B: yeah yeah 

592.43 593.94 B: yeah 

593.31 599.06 A: yeah no no no no no 'cause for me they were trying to test me to work in an office and i was like you know 

599.13 599.89 A: this is
