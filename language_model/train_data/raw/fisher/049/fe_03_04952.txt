0.12 1.13 B: (( hello )) 

1.28 2.38 A: hello 

2.47 4.07 B: hi this is kind of odd 

4.20 6.16 A: yeah have you done this before 

6.50 7.34 B: nah 

7.46 9.69 A: yeah i did this twice ah 

9.76 14.88 A: i don't know you just kind of chitchat for ten minutes and then a recording comes on and tells you when it's over it's pretty much painless 

14.70 17.38 B: wh- what are other things do you talk about 

16.51 18.50 A: ah you hear the topic 

18.54 21.44 B: yeah but is it is it that for everyone 

19.29 21.01 A: yeah censorship [mn] 

21.48 23.80 A: yeah it changes daily really 

23.83 25.05 B: oh okay 

25.29 27.57 A: but ah anyway yeah my name's mark 

27.44 28.55 B: hi i'm ken 

28.98 30.39 A: ah where are you from 

30.36 33.28 B: um california but i'm in the east coast 

33.01 33.87 A: oh good 

34.39 35.73 A: oh good um 

36.03 38.22 A: so i don't know just any thoughts on it 

38.84 40.84 B: well ah do you have any opinions 

40.94 46.45 A: ah yeah i'd go with ah just generally you know not extreme details ah 

47.61 52.40 A: probably censorship's all right in ah you know public schools but private schools 

52.43 53.32 A: (( [mn] well )) 

53.37 58.33 A: for the most part it's all right in public schools but private schools should probably have the right to do whatever they want 

58.73 59.57 B: why 

59.96 69.66 A: why i mean they're not receiving any money from the government ah people know what they're getting into no one's being forced to go there and ah it's really like a private institution they should be able to do what they want 

69.66 73.86 B: so what sort of things do you think a public school should be allowed to censor for 

73.30 76.06 A: (( ah first of all things for safety )) 

76.32 88.28 A: um maybe like not let this is shooting off the hip ken so you know whatever so maybe things ah safety things um you know they shouldn't be teaching kids how to make bombs and what not 

80.71 81.51 B: yeah 

87.69 88.44 B: (( oh )) 

88.52 89.57 A: um 

90.09 97.66 A: again the thing with public school is it it it it i think it has to be regional the censorship ah because basically i mean kids are being forced to got there 

97.68 106.34 A: so ah maybe ah county by county looking at the parent teacher association the parent's will decide you know what should be censored and what should not because they're you know 

106.45 108.57 A: essentially forcing their kids to go there 

108.70 119.61 B: but i mean don't you think that there's an argument saying that ah we have to watch out because localities might wanna censor things that we have a national interest in right like the kansas school board 

119.12 121.57 A: um you mean like prayer in school 

122.31 133.27 B: well the the kansas um school board banned evolution and so their their local area thought that was a good idea but our national you know concern is that we believe in science so 

126.51 128.45 A: (( oh oh oh yeah )) 

130.80 131.98 A: yeah 

132.91 140.39 A: yeah that's the thing then like ah you know the national um [lipsmack] department of education really doesn't do much it's all state run 

140.84 147.31 A: um you know department of education basically just hands out money but all curriculum stuff are all you know decided by the state the state boards of education 

147.48 157.86 A: the problem therein lies you know if it's of national interest well the national department of education surely step up and you know not certain states but it really doesn't work that way the state department of education 

156.64 165.61 B: well well what i i'm saying hypothetically let's say something happened where ah y- you know there's something that that we believed was 

165.96 176.98 B: part of what it meant to be an educated american n- nationally but ah it conflicted with with what people believed in a one town ah then w- what do you think should trump the other 

168.73 169.54 A: (( okay )) 

174.69 175.75 A: yeah 

177.17 178.24 A: yeah 

178.38 192.73 A: yeah tough call man 'cause you know it's gonna happen you know you see the like generalizations a lot like jesus west coast ideals are different than the east coast and you know southern you know deep south's gonna have much more traditional ideals than the north and ah 

192.80 196.20 A: [mn] regarding religion regarding politics regarding everything 

196.59 207.52 A: so ah yeah i know man that's a you know you could say that's state versus local rights and you know ultimate the constitution 'cause that's where the national sets precedence and ah you know the final say 

208.93 214.20 A: but ah at the same time y- you don't want to disregard 'cause i mean it's well first of all is education mentioned in the constitution 

209.76 210.32 B: (( [mn] )) 

214.13 224.02 A: i mean if not you have to look at the fourteenth amendment and say if it's not if it isn't mentioned it's a state's right but if it is i guess you gotta give ah you know the trump to the national level 

224.31 231.05 B: mhm but i mean you don't have any kind of philosophical urge on this that's not related to the american legal history 

232.00 234.24 A: ah regarding what exactly 

234.12 239.89 B: about just the idea of censorship and you know local local versus national opinion 

238.44 243.84 A: yeah oh i mean like in the homes man like rational adults there should be really not ah they should be able to do [mn] 

243.85 246.37 A: again th- the whole thing with me is ah 

246.39 247.76 A: you know if it doesn't [mn] if 

247.96 255.19 A: it doesn't harm anywhere else um regarding censorship regarding drugs regarding pretty much everything ah the people should you know 

255.26 258.45 A: (( rational adults pretty much should be able to do what they want )) 

258.45 261.56 B: well what if they're not what what if they're not rational 

258.64 260.28 A: and see what they want 

261.86 264.96 A: yeah that's it well i mean there's gonna be a 

265.81 268.30 A: [lipsmack] that's that's that's that's a tough call um 

268.27 282.97 B: or what if they they're teaching religion that's like a cult or something that that ah you know we if we're gonna be really cool about it we'll step back and say they can believe whatever they want but i mean the belief might ah entail animal sacrifices or ah 

282.09 295.70 A: yeah again that that you gotta draw the line between you know do we give rights to animals and and more so does does it effect other people i mean like say if a cult or whatever that wants to ah now we're getting off topic but it it's it's kind of the heart of the issue here um 

282.97 284.18 B: (( you know some- )) 

295.87 298.06 A: they you know if they they want to ah 

298.61 304.87 A: jesus light fires or something like that then yeah they should be able to do that but as long as it doesn't effect other people um 

304.26 307.45 B: okay well that one's pretty easy then but what if they ah 

308.22 318.77 B: ah you know what if what if it invades someone's else's public spirit but in in a way that suggests that it's not rational but there's a conflict between ah freedom privilege and right and ah kind of 

318.96 320.08 A: yeah 

319.56 322.35 B: you know rationality paradigm that we're on 

322.57 324.43 A: yeah 

323.83 325.42 B: like um 

325.45 337.83 B: or or maybe wh- let's say ah their it's a fundamental fundamentalist muslim group and we have suspicions that they're they're connected with terrorist organizations or something like that but there's no real indication of that it's just ah 

337.71 345.23 B: the hint given from their activities or something like that i mean should we censor those kind of should we censor their their speeches or something 

345.64 351.27 A: yeah um so it's sort of basically saying like you know their actions can lead to 

351.48 356.35 A: ah unfavorable things ah you know riots or what not 

355.44 361.12 B: yeah well my question is wh- do you end up doing a balancing test where you say well we have to calculate the harms versus 

361.13 370.17 B: what we think society would benefit from in terms of their free economy or do you go the other way and say no ah they have a fundamental right one way or the other 

370.28 372.09 A: yeah ah 

373.36 386.98 A: jeeze um putting me on the spot i'd say you gotta balance it um because you know it's traditional the traditional argument's y- y- you know you can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater even though you do have the freedom of speech it's still you know harmful to others and harmful to in general 

387.06 390.02 A: so can you have hate literature can you have hate speeches 

390.22 398.34 A: y- yeah well see i also think man i don't know ah do you wanna have that 'cause there is the possibility of pissing people off or it's a possibility of riots 

398.67 402.92 A: and i guess it's all um i don't know man i really don't what do you think 

402.84 409.42 B: well i mean it seems like w- we have to change the way that we talk it because it doesn't seem like either of these choices are really fair because 

409.33 423.64 B: the id- the idea that you could have a balancing test presumes that you there something that you could calculate but there's no way you could draw some kind of causal link between what someone says and what the action that results would be i mean there's no way you would know how to stop because ah i 

419.56 421.08 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

423.56 425.18 B: mean the effects 

425.75 426.86 B: in one 

426.77 435.36 B: generation could a million years or i mean a millennia time line be you know the great poetic ethic of that decade though you know i mean 

433.41 434.34 A: uh-huh 

435.20 442.12 B: y- y- i i don't think there's any way you can measure subtract yourself from the equation and subtract your own value of that also 

442.09 446.19 A: yeah yeah ah if you don't mind me asking ken how old are you if 

446.74 447.78 B: what 

447.57 449.37 A: you don't mind me asking how old are you 

449.17 450.46 B: um 

450.60 453.45 B: you know i'm really not sure i think i'm twenty three 

453.35 457.79 A: yeah did you ever ah do any debate at high school specifically ah 

456.69 459.75 B: yeah i did a little bit what what are you 

458.07 459.87 A: (( linc- ah lincoln douglas )) 

459.86 460.66 B: huh 

460.57 461.77 A: lincoln douglas 

462.37 474.54 B: um i did it a few times but it it was very frustrating because i was interested in it for in first years of creativity and things but everyone just repeated all the same arguments that were in books so very frustrating 

472.04 477.42 A: yeah yeah kind if hear like i did it for x. amount of years in high school and ah 

477.83 486.64 A: some of the stuff you're saying i mean definitely heard it before i mean not not not jesus not saying that you're not original or anything but but you know so many people bring up those arguments they're pretty good arguments 

486.57 489.75 B: ah cool so what what do you do these days 

487.84 488.84 A: um 

489.93 493.17 A: (( ah i'm still in school still undergrad stuff )) 

493.19 494.41 B: where where do you go 

494.40 499.77 A: university of scranton it's a small j- jesuit school it's all right it's pretty cool what are you up to 

496.18 496.74 B: (( [mn] )) 

499.96 501.77 B: um i'm at a law school 

501.79 502.62 A: (( are you )) 

503.74 504.87 B: um 

503.76 504.94 A: how's that going 

505.33 510.91 B: what ah it's okay it's okay we we just finished ah and some weird things happened here 

506.08 507.23 A: how's that going 

511.27 512.33 B: um 

512.35 525.00 B: you know it's kind of funny because i guess we're supposed to talk about censorship but i mean the point of this experiment is probably i mean it's obviously nothing to do with its topics right so i mean it's most likely with our diversions or 

521.36 522.99 A: yeah yeah yeah 

524.97 530.00 B: i mean it'd be funny if if the topic of the experiment had nothing to do with content at all and just had to with 

530.02 533.28 B: our the length of our pauses or the length of our 

533.04 534.07 A: yeah 

533.45 535.66 B: you know inflections or ums 

534.11 541.72 A: our tones of voices yeah exactly depending on ah you know if we're talking or what we're talking about depending on how our voice changes 

542.40 543.32 B: yeah just 

542.43 547.42 A: could be anything man it it's honestly like my experience with it been pretty damn thorough um 

543.55 544.71 B: that that's 

547.32 559.95 A: i've talked to a few kids first of all th- the only think i'm worried about really honestly not for the sake of science or anything like that that i get paid at the end and a few of friends have done this and they all got paid so the point is ah i've talked to kids in georgia um 

559.96 572.81 A: new hampshire and pennsylvania so far and they've all done it and like you know how you're supposed to sign up for a certain amount of time and then x. like when you're available there's never been a time like they've called and no one else was on the other line like there's a lot of people signed up for this 

572.81 574.44 B: yeah 

573.96 577.86 A: so i mean honestly like topic wise yeah i don't think it's important at all because ah 

578.29 581.94 A: this is the third topic i had and none of them ah 

581.95 584.55 A: arguably they have been related 

584.17 592.55 B: well i'm not so much worried about whether the topic is the point or not but it's more funny that we'll never find out what the actual point is you know it's kind of like um 

590.75 591.80 A: yeah 

593.47 599.50 B: being invited to a party where everyone else is dressed according to a theme but you can't ever figure out what that theme is that's kind of 

598.77 599.84 A: yeah 

599.57 599.89 B: (( [mn] ))
