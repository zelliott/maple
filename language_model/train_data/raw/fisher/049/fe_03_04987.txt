44.04 44.89 A: uh-huh

58.47 59.36 A: yeah 

60.65 73.36 A: um well i used to also and i used to get up early and go and then um uh when it becomes inconvenient then then i don't like to do it so if i have to go too far you know more than a half hour away or something 

73.27 77.09 A: then then i then i don't do it 'cause it's too inconvenient 

76.11 78.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i i )) 

77.50 81.87 A: so right now i mean the only thing i walk about six miles a day 

81.88 82.78 B: (( [mn] wow )) 

81.90 91.92 A: because i'm in manhattan so i have to go up and down stairs for the subway and i have to walk you know all of my clients are in different parts of the island so i'm walking back and forth all the time [sigh] 

91.37 95.06 B: [noise] oh that's a good exercise it it's more than ever i get actually [noise] 

92.61 103.48 A: so that's yeah that helps [laughter] and i and i live in a five floor walk up [noise] so i have to walk up five flights of stairs to come home [sigh] back and forth so [laughter] there's no 

102.72 105.50 B: that's more than what i get in the whole week actually 

104.79 107.32 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

105.86 107.38 B: [laughter] i just do 

107.15 121.13 B: i just park right in my driveway so i just walk like twenty twenty steps before i get the main entrance the house [laughter] like my office i sometimes take i i i'm being forced sometimes to take the elevator [laughter] because these guys are like doing maintenance and stuff 

112.58 114.52 A: [laughter] 

118.45 119.60 A: [laughter] 

120.75 121.61 A: uh-huh 

121.16 125.00 B: so it takes it you must take the elevator and [noise] uh 

125.44 134.31 B: so the overall [laughter] my fitness uh now that it's mentioned the only thing that i do for exercising is probably the lawn maintenance the backyard 

133.73 135.42 A: [noise] oh yeah [laughter] 

134.57 139.89 B: i'm i'm currently doing that for example outside just got the call and then i'm currently mowing the lawn 

140.23 142.26 A: oh you're you're going to be mowing lawns [mn] 

141.67 148.31 B: [noise] yeah i was actually [laughter] i i right now just now i'm picking up all the debris and uh all the 

148.60 150.11 B: (( the the lawn )) 

150.90 151.71 A: uh-huh 

151.70 155.80 B: and i'm just currently bagging that up and putting that ready for the trash to pick up tomorrow 

155.45 156.27 A: (( ah [laughter] )) 

156.32 158.62 B: that's probably the exercise that i get [laughter] 

158.15 160.24 A: [laughter] 

159.31 166.83 B: but as as a as a routine [noise] as like something that i really take care of it's not it's not that important for me personally and i know that i should actually [laughter] 

165.67 167.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

167.26 170.65 A: yeah uh that's that's a big problem actually in the united states too 

171.01 174.36 A: you know es- especially if you live in the suburbs i think 

173.13 176.05 B: [noise] yeah i i do actually 

175.39 178.45 A: yeah i used to i was raised in uh detroit 

178.12 179.41 B: [noise] oh you 

178.77 185.55 A: so until until about uh ten years ago i moved to the city but before that i was in the detroit suburbs and uh 

185.60 190.77 A: there most of my relatives are all you know huge they weigh like three or four hundred pounds 

186.11 187.94 B: (( were )) 

189.90 192.92 B: [noise] [noise] oh my oh my 

190.93 201.62 A: [laughter] because they they don't ever ever ever exercise so when i'm yeah i mean not at all you know just the just the remote control on the t._v. and that's about it 

195.76 197.82 B: (( that's huge i mean like [noise] )) 

201.58 214.78 A: so when i moved to the city uh um it became important for me to make sure that i tried to you know stay fit i think one of the reasons i like living in the city is because i have to i have to get exercise even if i don't belong to a club you know 

214.64 222.43 B: [noise] yeah that's right but you know that's probably one of the reasons why i don't exercise that much i don't know it's probably my constitution but my father 

222.44 224.08 B: he used to eat like a 

224.26 237.48 B: like a i don't know like an elephant he ate a lot i mean [noise] seriously but he keep thin he remain thin all time so so do i like all time i i can eat like an animal [laughter] i can have like two lunches all all at once 

225.85 226.95 A: [laughter] 

230.32 231.67 A: oh so his met- 

233.81 234.71 A: uh-huh 

237.69 245.32 B: and then um and then i i just i don't i don't get fat i don't get fat at all i just don't gain weight 

240.22 240.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

244.96 250.07 A: [mn] oh that's great so your metabolism in your family is good then probably 

245.41 246.37 B: i 

248.62 251.13 B: yeah it goes fast 

250.39 254.85 A: do you do you um maybe maybe uh you guys eat better food too 

255.08 255.97 A: 'cause 

255.40 262.66 B: [laughter] probably probably that that's right also because as you might notice already i'm not uh from the states i'm uh from colombia 

262.08 263.17 A: (( oh okay )) 

262.64 270.18 B: and probably the type of food that you get even though it's [noise] it's sort of tempting because it's kind of greasy sometimes a lot of carbohydrates and stuff like that 

269.64 271.64 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

270.01 281.00 B: but um i don't know i'm probably just use very used to it but if i uh would be switching to the diet here in the states it it's so rich you have vitamins in everything even the water is vitamins 

280.68 282.74 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

282.06 285.26 B: so i would i would get fat i i can tell 

284.90 289.63 A: yeah [laughter] if you especially maybe if you were eating the packaged foods like every day 

289.51 290.74 B: yeah that's right [mn] 

289.59 296.67 A: all the time yeah i i mean like i know that people those relatives of mine that are really really really big 

291.57 292.26 B: [noise] 

296.58 304.69 A: they all go to costco you know to shop and when they go to costco they buy everything just huge quantities 

297.10 298.46 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

304.89 313.67 A: and um it's all fatty it's all prepackaged it's all um you know it's it all has like as much cheese and fat as you can put in it 

313.60 322.70 A: and they and they don't think anything about it you know it's all artificial flavors artificial colors you know artificial sweeteners and as long as it tastes good they don't care 

318.73 319.93 B: (( [noise] my [noise] )) 

322.65 323.53 B: (( my )) 

323.19 330.91 A: so it it in new york like you said being ethnic and stuff in new york at least i i think most of the people i know 

323.88 325.43 B: it's like 

330.87 339.39 A: like to eat um you know di- foods from all over the world all the time and prepared food even if it's at a restaurant at least it's prepared you know 

338.75 339.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

339.50 342.43 B: yeah variety for them it's much better [laughter] 

339.55 340.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

341.57 346.30 A: yeah a lot of variety and so you're getting um you're getting like a lot more vegetables and stuff too 

346.64 351.07 B: that helps that helps and the other thing is i i used to live uh like for 

346.74 347.37 A: [sigh] 

347.70 348.49 A: (( [sigh] )) 

351.34 354.50 B: sort of [noise] a year almost in argentina 

354.17 355.16 A: oh yeah 

354.56 362.76 B: over there and these guys yeah and they really care about your appearance and your uh i mean like all the time they [noise] all the girls they're skinny as 

360.95 361.78 A: uh-huh 

363.10 364.20 B: a pole [noise] 

363.97 365.24 A: [laughter] really 

364.57 377.98 B: they're very skinny they're so skinny and they're gorgeous also so they really pay that much attention to appearance and that really re- gets reflected like if you go to a restaurant you can get up to like twelve varieties of salad 

374.52 375.35 A: uh-huh 

377.94 378.78 A: uh-huh 

377.98 388.22 B: and you can get a lot of uh vegetables diet food so really it does encourages you to keep the keep fit and uh without too much exercising i guess [laughter] 

387.47 389.51 A: oh it that's the culture 

389.51 397.56 B: [noise] uh it's probably yeah the culture it's you're getting back to the culture thing cultural topic as as you said it is really hard to deal with 

390.69 391.53 A: yeah 

394.45 395.32 A: yeah 

397.45 399.07 A: yeah that makes a lot of sense 

400.73 412.86 B: they are very impressive on on that aspect about [laughter] being to [mn] to like paying too much attention to a physical appearance specially the girls they are really really really 

403.53 404.47 A: [laughter] 

408.39 410.53 A: yeah yeah all in 

410.59 411.41 A: [laughter] 

411.53 423.48 A: new york is too much about that too so you know it's all about the look and stuff especially manhattan everybody walks around trying to look thin and stuff so i think that helps some people stay thin [laughter] 

417.40 419.74 B: [noise] 

419.79 420.79 B: (( yeah i know i )) 

422.56 433.16 B: yeah i know i i i've been in manhattan like i i used to stop by like twice a year or so i had to go by i like live for the parade and stuff so i stay the week over the weekend 

427.66 428.78 A: (( oh yeah )) 

432.84 434.65 A: yeah for the colombian parade 

434.12 439.40 B: ah macy's parade yeah the macy's parade yeah i i but it's really cold [noise]

439.13 441.73 A: oh yeah yeah yeah [laughter] 

440.10 444.31 B: it's really cold but 'cause it gets colder than here in boston 

443.25 445.17 A: yeah i know it's weird 

445.31 447.29 A: new york has kinda strange weather 

447.34 455.76 A: i it's funny i mean after i became about thirty years old i've been talking to people just friends and stuff and um i'm thirty five now 

455.18 457.13 B: (( it's thirty five [noise] [noise] )) 

455.95 462.50 A: yeah and fr- a lot of friends one after thirty they didn't they didn't really get as serious about the health clubs 

462.83 468.07 A: it's when they start to get busy with other things in life you know like family and career and stuff 

464.00 473.41 B: [laughter] yeah that's right that's that's probably the other thing actually now that you mention that i like that really affects 

468.16 468.96 A: it 

471.53 472.44 A: yeah 

473.38 487.13 B: me [noise] 'cause i i i wish i would have more time for example if i had extra time i don't know if i would be still doing exercising because i right now my family i have like i have two children right now so that i have to pay a lot of attention on them 

483.62 484.64 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

486.20 489.83 A: yeah yeah you can't just go to the health club for two hours 

489.72 502.15 B: no way they wouldn't let me do it they wouldn't at all other thing it's really hard to wake up and do it on my on my own time which is something i don't even get at all [laughter] don't have life 

490.33 491.36 A: [laughter] 

491.65 492.89 A: [laughter]

508.80 510.70 B: (( [noise] [noise] excuse me )) 

509.47 514.61 A: i think that we're both making sense you know that what we're talking about makes sense so 

513.50 526.59 B: oh yeah [laughter] yeah that probably is one of the things that you al- always think about but you never talk about is little bit of guiltiness sensation on your part [laughter] after talking about it now i'm going to start thinking about it 

518.95 520.13 A: yeah 

522.59 523.77 A: [laughter] 

525.84 527.54 A: [laughter]

543.04 551.87 B: [noise] [noise] yeah probably yeah that's a good way i mean walking they say that that you should walk at least a mile daily and you're doing six times that so uh 

544.92 546.35 A: it's a good exercise [noise] 

549.36 552.68 A: yeah [noise] [laughter] 

551.99 554.63 B: that's better than what i do [laughter] which is nothing
