102.81 107.63 A: [noise] absolutely i i agree with you on that on that on that ah 

107.76 109.54 A: on that point ah [noise] i'll 

109.56 111.49 A: tell ya i ah 

112.01 112.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

112.67 121.15 A: i [sigh] wh- what let let me ask you this what do you think about why do you think there is so much divorce i mean what do you think's the main reason why there's so much divorce 

120.99 124.34 B: i think in a lot of cases i'd well first of all 

124.50 130.78 B: you have to look at the age we're living in uh we're in a constant state of change which is something that hasn't happened [sigh] 

130.90 135.01 B: ah you know since before the divorce rate went went up um 

135.08 138.85 B: you know we- we've had and i think that if you looked 

138.93 149.65 B: ah and this is just my personal guess but if you looked at any time in the in the in the united states just as an example where there has been a great state of change [sigh] ah there have been 

149.78 160.83 B: you know such as the industrial revolution there probably have been a slight increase in the number of divorces ah but i think that [sigh] you know as far as divorce is concerned um 

160.84 171.32 B: at least in this day and age first of all we're in a constant state of change second of all [sigh] we are in a disposable society where if something doesn't work rather than fixing it [sigh] we throw it out and get a new one 

170.10 172.68 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] just throw it out and get anoth- that's right 

171.78 174.14 B: yeah and ah you know 

172.81 173.78 A: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

174.18 180.70 B: to complicate matters further i think that ah [sigh] in an age of you know so-called free love ah 

180.63 187.45 B: [sigh] you know you have a situation where people may not get to know each other as well as they should before they 

187.38 198.57 B: [sigh] ah you get married i mean in the older days you know divorce wasn't acceptable and whoever you got married to [sigh] whether you liked them or not [laughter] what ever the situation was you you stayed married to them [sigh] 

198.56 204.49 B: and you know then there was the time where divorce was acceptable but hardly you know used 

204.45 215.42 B: and if you look at those times ah people worked on their problems they didn't just throw things out you know if something broke you fixed it you didn't try and get a new one 

205.17 207.04 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

214.96 217.22 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

216.01 225.97 B: you know unless it was absolutely broken down and that's [sigh] i think that our our attitudes towards our things is very much in the same way our attitudes towards our people 

226.40 229.11 B: you know if your if your marriage doesn't work 

226.55 229.10 A: [noise] [noise] spouses mates friends 

229.32 231.09 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

229.72 233.45 B: if your marriage doesn't work go get a new one you know [laughter] [sigh] 

232.50 236.40 A: yeah yeah [lipsmack] 

233.78 245.04 B: and you know that's just not the way that it should work but that's the way that i think a lot of people see it you know and [sigh] you know you look at all the different problems that you know exist 

239.71 241.16 A: yeah 

245.45 250.15 B: and rather than trying to fix them we just try to skirt around them you know 

249.22 257.54 A: [noise] [noise] le- let me ask you this what what did what what is your do a do you ah do you believe in god or do you have a religious affil- affiliation or 

256.30 262.83 B: [noise] i'm i'm i'm technically an episcopalian but ah yeah it's ah to put a short answer to that yes i believe in god 

259.22 260.64 A: mhm 

262.19 266.87 A: [noise] yeah well i'll tell you what [cough] i my take on this thing is that 

266.94 269.12 A: we got we got ah we 

269.42 271.90 A: got too many marriages taking place 

271.56 272.47 B: (( yup )) 

272.17 273.81 A: (( and ah )) 

273.85 279.84 A: and what and what's happening is people are marrying on their carnal lust on their 

279.17 281.33 B: well exactly that's what i was saying 

280.07 282.40 A: and and and rather than rather than 

282.92 294.81 A: rather than making god the forefront when you get ready to do something uh [noise] because ah i think i- if if people were to find god first they say you you you come to god and you find him [noise] [noise] 

286.10 288.73 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

291.19 291.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

292.33 292.89 B: (( [sigh] )) 

293.11 303.61 B: well let's let- let's take god out of the equation for a minute no matter what your religious affiliation is whether you're christian or buddhist or [sigh] you know jewish or whatever 

302.07 303.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

303.50 308.74 B: whether you believe in a higher power or not the the basic precept of marriage 

308.99 312.18 B: is to settle down with one person [sigh] 

311.97 324.69 B: and you know to to make that person you know your partner for the rest of your life your best friend your partner [sigh] your lover everything and it's very hard to make someone that [sigh] when 

324.59 330.49 B: you know as you said the two minute marriages you don't know who you're marrying you know 

330.48 335.07 B: [sigh] um an- and that's what happens people find each other they're attracted to each other 

334.91 348.65 B: they don't spend a lot of time with each other they don't know each other and then they go and get married because they think it's the right thing to do [sigh] and that's where we get into trouble and yes religion is important to me and i think that you know 

339.71 340.96 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

348.87 363.16 B: ah [mn] i i dunno maybe you know if you looked at the sociological statistics maybe a christian marriage does [sigh] lead to a a happier marriage but i think ah you know and a a and a longer lasting marriage but i think if you look at the basic ah 

363.21 366.79 B: [sigh] you know the basic phenomenon of a christian marriage you 

367.08 374.94 B: generally those are stick- sticking to tradit- tradit- [mn] traditional values of you know s- okay let's see 

375.05 386.48 B: you know let's see each other for a while let's figure out whether we're compatible let's figure out if the you know the rest of our lives is is what we want [sigh] that's what my wife and i did and that's why we're still together 

386.37 387.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] that's great [cough] )) 

387.94 389.35 B: you know um 

388.62 390.14 A: that's great [noise] 

389.72 401.74 B: and you know you can you can you can say it's christian you can say it's you know [sigh] the whatever we did but in the end it's because my wife and i were friends before we got married you know we [laughter] 

399.21 401.02 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

401.67 412.78 B: because you you have to be friends with the person you're gonna marry you can't just be attracted to somebody i d- i don't think that works i mean maybe some people get lucky but you can't just be you have to be friends 

413.17 419.02 B: if you're not friends it's not going to work because i mean who wants to live with someone for the rest of their life that they're not friends with 

418.88 421.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah yup [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

420.27 421.20 B: you know 

421.76 433.24 B: [sigh] and you know in in ancient times it was just a matter of you know whoever you got stuck with you made it work and and that's why it worked but now [sigh] with so much choice available with the fact that you can literally meet your 

433.15 437.46 B: soulmate you know from across the country or even across the world 

437.51 445.80 B: you know the problem is that people aren't waiting to find their soulmate they're not waiting to find the person they can be friends with [sigh] they're you know first th- first thing that says i do 

445.91 446.96 B: you know [sigh] 

447.28 449.22 B: first person that agrees 

448.41 455.56 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah yeah well you you certainly made some good points on that topic i [cough] i tend to believe that ah 

454.32 455.04 B: (( [noise] )) 

455.84 459.91 A: well i believe if you put god in it then people then people will ah 

460.45 461.75 A: (( they will ah )) 

461.88 466.83 A: will be more prone to do the right thing you know what i mean i mean it's this is like christian marriages 

464.19 465.87 B: (( [sigh] well i )) 

466.43 479.24 B: [mn] it's not just oh yeah [sigh] it's not just put god in it though it's it's it you know as as much as i'd like to say god is the answer to everything because i believe he is at least for me [sigh] you know it's 

467.43 470.30 A: break up just like the regular marriages do you know 

470.57 471.66 A: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

479.66 485.26 B: just as possible to have a you know for that matter a voodoo wedding that lasts forever you know 

483.32 484.86 A: (( [cough] [noise] [cough] )) 

484.89 486.28 A: (( right [noise] [noise] yup )) 

485.19 494.98 B: you you know it's it's quite simply a matter of placing your your trust in a higher power but also placing your trust in each other [sigh] 

494.81 500.76 B: and but also it just making sure that you know the basic tenets of marriage are followed [sigh] they're you know 

500.65 510.90 B: [mn] being you know true to each other and being there in sickness and in health [sigh] and knowing each other before you get married knowing that you're supposed to spend your li- the rest of your life with that person 

510.68 511.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

511.17 517.47 B: [sigh] because it's not gonna do you any good no matter what religion you are if you don't follow those basic tenets of marriage 

517.15 518.76 A: (( r- right [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

518.16 524.05 B: you know you can you can say it's god til you're blue in the face you can say it's buddha you can say whoever you want [sigh] 

524.14 536.45 B: and you know i mean i'm i'm very intellectual guy and i'm also a very spiritual guy and that you know sometimes causes problems for my own train of thought but as far i'm concerned it doesn't really matter who you believe in 

536.66 546.25 B: you know i mean i'm not gonna say that i'm right i think that's one of the most you know asinine stances anyone can take as far as you know what i believe in religion 

546.28 557.00 B: you know i'm the way i see it is everyone's right in their own right and you just ne- you know as far as marriage is concerned it's it's a matter of yes i think having a belief in god can help you 

556.81 562.31 B: [sigh] but so so do i think having a belief in any you know organized religion can help you [sigh] 

562.46 570.11 B: you know whether or not i'm gonna agree with your organized religion is a completely different story you know [sigh] um but 

566.49 567.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

570.27 573.52 B: you know as far as that's concerned yeah i i think it's ah 

573.74 577.23 B: [sigh] i you know i i think that yeah having a belief in god can help 

575.26 581.70 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] but but i mean if you check the statistics muslim marriages ah hold up better than christian marriages do [laughter] so 

580.31 588.17 B: i i prob- i believe that but then again muslim marriages are probably what ninety percent arranged yeah [laughter] you know 

581.97 583.12 A: if you if you 

585.06 589.09 A: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] yeah [laughter] )) 

588.84 599.89 B: i mean you know and and arranged marriages do work because in those religions they have no choice and a- and that just [mn] further illustrates my point which is if you're gonna go with that kind of thing 

589.13 590.27 A: yeah
