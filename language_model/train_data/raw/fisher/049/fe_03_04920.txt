0.00 1.41 B: oh pat 

1.18 2.63 A: hello joe 

2.50 3.89 B: (( oh how you doing joe )) 

3.80 5.02 A: good how are you 

4.75 12.14 B: all right so they were saying urination analysis huh checking you for the piss test and the drug test 

10.81 13.83 A: for drug- for drugs right 

12.67 15.47 B: yeah well i think that it's [mn] important 

15.80 21.36 B: because if we've got these drug addicts driving around on the road out here i'm in new york myself 

21.54 25.88 B: and they riding around like maniacs as it is 

25.98 28.12 B: so imagine if they were on drugs 

27.41 29.26 A: [sigh] that's true yeah 

28.59 29.66 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

29.74 31.37 B: but ah where you from 

31.24 32.90 A: [laughter] i'm in seattle 

32.61 34.45 B: oh you're in seattle washington 

34.19 35.33 A: yeah 

34.56 38.17 B: so do they have a high rate of the drug intake in 

37.41 41.73 A: oh yeah it's pretty bad especially in meth yeah 

39.06 50.80 B: it is pretty bad what's like the worst drug out there like crystal meth or something yeah that methamphetamine i think it stays in your system for a long enough period of time for you to 

43.51 44.61 A: (( [noise] i )) 

50.71 56.73 B: you know what i mean where they catch it like more than three days or almost a month or something like that [laughter] 

56.01 60.72 A: i i think they they i read somewhere they can test your hair and tell up to a year 

60.07 61.13 B: (( [noise] a year )) 

61.27 62.16 A: so 

61.50 63.05 B: isn't that something 

62.95 73.36 B: is it a ru- invasion of privacy i don't know see if this is a illegal state where the drugs would be legal then [mn] i guess it's not an you know they have reason 

73.21 79.91 B: you know don't test me and you don't have a reason to test me like i didn't do anything you know illegal or 

79.08 82.52 A: [noise] i think if they have a policy that is fair 

82.57 83.50 B: right 

82.61 86.02 A: and involves everybody that works there including the boss 

85.66 89.36 B: right that's right don't test me if you're not testing the boss 

86.77 91.21 A: [mn] you know you you ca- you can't pick on somebody because he acts 

91.31 104.14 A: happy or because he wears headphones or whatever and 'cause he looks different than you you gotta do everybody equal if you do everybody equal then it's you know the only people that have to worry are the people that are on drugs 

94.43 95.67 B: exactly 

99.71 100.97 B: (( mm )) 

103.77 104.98 B: yup that's it 

104.92 105.72 A: (( you know )) 

105.36 110.82 B: that's it and and none of 'em you know [sigh] you know they gotta be very careful 

109.11 115.64 A: [noise] my my worry with it is i've seen cases where bosses have used that as reasons to get rid of people 

114.86 115.94 B: (( [sigh] yes )) 

116.11 122.13 A: they he'll know five or six or seven people that are probably on drugs but he picks the one he wants to get rid of 

121.46 123.46 B: rid of that's right 

122.29 132.89 A: and he drug tests him and then he says well we'd let him go 'cause he flunked the drug test and k- k- keeps who he likes they i don't go along with that but i don't know how you could stop that 

126.98 128.92 B: right right 

132.65 133.91 B: that's true 

133.92 137.65 B: that's true that's a good aspect i've never even thought of that 

136.84 144.55 A: because if it's random they don't have to test everybody all at once it's just kinda you know when somebody's number's up but ah 

141.79 142.80 B: (( right [noise] )) 

144.72 153.52 A: you know then you got work from those comp cases you know people getting hurt on the job you know if they're loaded on drugs and they get hurt at work then 

145.19 146.57 B: when there's someone 

152.67 153.42 B: right 

153.95 155.09 A: th- th- 

154.38 156.15 B: that was their fault 

155.25 161.50 A: everyb- yeah the boss gotta the company's gotta pay but in the long run that makes everybody's insurance go up 

161.04 163.70 B: mhm [noise] yeah 

162.58 164.52 A: so you know 

164.89 171.42 A: i know i don't know how it is in new york but in washington if you get hurt at work and you go to the hospital the first thing they do is drug test you 

171.18 172.66 B: oh 

172.26 176.22 A: right there th- they tell you you you have to agree to it 

173.27 174.58 B: wow 

175.61 177.00 B: mhm 

176.40 180.80 A: and if you don't agree to it then you have to pay your own doctor and hospital bills 

180.73 183.15 B: (( right yeah )) 

182.11 187.22 A: so you know they take a blood sample in the emergency room so 

185.39 186.36 B: wow 

186.57 195.22 B: and that's a more thorough check anyway because with the urine i i remember people putting bleach in the urine and you know diluting it 

193.74 196.71 A: oh yeah there's different tricks you know with ah 

195.76 196.71 B: yeah 

197.08 200.35 B: to to try and dilute it mm 

199.58 205.95 A: but ah w- with the blood they can test alcohol and drugs and everything get a wider range of a 

202.52 203.39 B: yeah 

203.58 204.43 B: yeah 

205.31 209.44 B: and and now they i heard they have a a shampoo for the hair 

209.72 219.10 B: that if they shampoo their hair they can take the chemicals that were produced that ah you know the the positive results 

219.02 219.95 A: yeah 

219.29 223.39 B: but it yeah they change their hair now by washing it or whatever [mn] 

221.53 222.43 A: (( oh )) 

223.60 228.47 A: oh i don't know how that'd work 'cause it's it's inside your hair you know 

227.47 233.24 B: i know so it's like how could they wash it out for the test to come back negative 

232.98 235.79 A: i wouldn't want that stuff in my hair i don't think 

236.03 237.16 B: right 

236.58 238.70 A: i mean if it's gonna be that strength 

238.62 242.92 B: yeah right that yeah that strong it is that strong 

240.86 241.96 A: yeah 

243.09 246.60 A: well i think that unfortunately um 

248.21 262.89 A: because of of safety things for everybody you know if people what people wanna do is their business that's their business but when you gonna take it to work and if you're gonna [mn] put other people at risk 

255.47 256.84 B: mhm 

262.16 263.39 B: yeah 

262.90 270.09 A: or if you're gonna be a like a cab driver or a bus driver and you're gonna be out on the street and you're putting lots of people's lives in risk 

269.85 270.93 B: (( right )) 

270.30 285.07 A: it's just the same thing as doing a dr- you know drunk you you can't you don't have any business driving if you're drunk you're gonna i mean if you wanna kill yourself kill yourself that's your business but don't take out thirty people with you you know they might not be ready to die yet 

273.67 274.49 B: yes 

275.61 277.23 B: that's it you can't 

278.88 279.69 B: (( right )) 

282.31 283.66 B: that's it 

284.79 286.22 B: mhm 

285.63 292.94 A: and you're not asking them permission [laughter] you know it's like no so everyb- you know [mn] it's it gets kinda iffy the you know it's like 

293.08 298.51 A: yeah it can go too far because everytime you make a rule where you can test somebody or 

298.89 303.78 A: [mn] back wh- in the days when they used to give lie detector tests you know it used to be the same thing you know 

303.70 313.79 A: b- bosses would use them to get rid of somebody that they wanted to get rid of them and that you you could rig the test because you could just tell the guy to ask oh yeah ask a question like 

306.92 308.22 B: mhm 

309.84 312.31 B: it's the anxiety right 

313.64 319.52 A: have you ever come into work five minutes late or left five minutes early well see i mean they they 

318.74 321.48 B: everybody did that right [laughter] 

319.75 323.60 A: sure but they they they can catch you on it and you know 

323.10 329.20 B: right right they make you nervous and now that you're nervous they're gonna use those readings to do yeah yeah 

323.75 324.96 A: so 

327.72 338.04 A: yeah and they they you know of course that's they can't do that now they can't you know make you lie detector tests because they're not they're not that accurate any- i mean sometimes they're not accurate [noise] 

332.26 335.93 B: right the false positive that's the false positive 

337.34 338.17 B: no 

337.96 345.73 A: and people that should flunk 'em pass 'em and people that should pass 'em flunk 'em [sigh] but most drug tests are pretty sophisticated 

342.28 343.15 B: right 

345.13 350.79 B: yeah where they could see or read and it's according to the d._n._a. now and they know 

345.94 347.12 A: and ah 

349.57 353.25 A: oh yeah it- it's it's mind boggling what they can do 

352.85 354.12 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

353.29 363.26 A: but w- i i think we do have to keep an eye on it and make sure that it's not abused because i can see the potential for abusing it [sigh] okay let's say um 

363.77 367.25 A: a p- a person [mn] did have alcohol in their 

367.53 369.95 A: their urine or their blood just that day 

369.72 370.76 B: mhm 

370.18 374.99 A: and ordinarily they don't drink but then you know that ends up ah 

375.19 377.93 A: you know that test ends up being positive 

376.68 378.69 B: (( mm right )) 

378.09 383.04 A: where else [sigh] where's that information stored and who gets access to it 

382.35 384.41 B: yeah yeah 

383.32 390.93 A: that's that's you know is this person going to be labelled a drug a- addict or an alcoholic forever because of one drug test you know 

386.86 388.73 B: exactly 

390.64 391.88 B: mhm 

391.23 400.74 A: or what about somebody that cleans his act up and stops ah using or whatever and ah is that test gonna come back in three or four years when he's trying to get ah 

400.73 410.02 A: [sigh] maybe trying to get a student grant an- and and or public housing or try to get something and come back and haunt him as and label him a drug user when he wasn't you know 

403.04 404.47 B: oh right 

409.60 410.90 B: mhm 

410.35 411.39 A: so 

411.54 412.37 A: you know 

412.46 413.52 B: it's the 

413.37 423.81 A: the trouble with big brother is you know they they they have such an enormous way to store information and and i i don't trust who can get at it and for what reason 

421.85 423.11 B: that's it 

423.17 426.17 B: that's right that's right 

424.85 429.82 A: you know they wanna [mn] do something against you they'll they'll they they'll they 

428.68 431.32 B: they could do it and they could keep it that way 

430.91 436.09 A: they keep it up and they'll say well look here he wa- he was a drug addict ten years ago [mn] you know 

434.52 436.09 B: yeah ten years [sigh] 

436.17 437.24 A: and ah 

437.36 448.25 A: that's all you hear about and maybe it was just o- and o- just one time he went out and just happened to be drug tested the next day so you can't ruin somebody's life for one thing like that that's not right [sigh] 

442.62 443.70 B: (( [noise] right )) 

443.89 445.25 B: and ended up y- 

446.53 447.44 B: no 

447.49 448.35 B: no 

448.57 449.91 B: but the one day 

448.59 458.72 A: but see i worked with a guy that they got rid of because had by giv- giving him a drug test and and th- th- they coulda given it to about ten people and ten people would've flunked it 

458.37 459.18 B: (( right mhm )) 

458.55 464.81 A: but they just signalled h- singled him out because he was giving the boss a hard time all the time and the boss wanted to get rid of him 

459.99 463.80 B: (( mm )) 

464.25 465.48 B: mhm 

464.90 469.59 A: and he didn't have no way to get rid of him without him collecting unemployment and all that kind of stuff so 

468.51 470.75 B: oh exactly exactly 

469.71 482.07 A: he just said called at home said you gotta go to the hospital get the drug test you know and say we're scheduling them all this week we'll call you at home if we we want you to take 'em well he- he's the only one that got called 

474.45 475.57 B: right 

479.06 479.85 B: right 

481.48 483.25 B: (( oh )) 

482.69 487.91 A: see but it- it's how they let you know they call you at home like if you're supposed to be work at nine oclock 

487.57 488.68 B: right 

488.14 494.20 A: they call you at at seven thirty and they say well instead of coming to work go over to the hospital get tested this morning then come to work 

493.79 495.08 B: right 

494.40 504.28 A: and so and that way it's like if somebody knows that they're gonna flunk it then they can just quit their job right then they don't get embarrassed at work yeah but ah 

500.89 503.75 B: (( mhm mm mm mm yeah )) 

504.94 519.12 A: anyway he they go they always say well we're s- we're doing the scheduling this week so different people well no but y- you don't know because because there and ask every single person there you know some of them you don't even know they look at you like you're crazy 

515.46 516.85 B: exactly 

518.82 519.82 B: yeah 

519.13 524.32 A: and you're not you're told th- th- they're not to say anything anyway if you're you're chosen or whatever so 

522.22 523.37 B: that's it 

524.23 525.15 B: yeah 

524.54 527.42 A: but we talked amongst ourself nobody else got called 

527.24 528.35 B: nobody 

528.54 536.46 A: b- but him and [mn] th- it was it was pretty well known that he partied a lot on the weekends and they got him on a monday morning you know 

529.04 530.42 B: (( mm yup )) 

534.85 536.34 B: mm 

536.76 539.11 A: he still has sh- still has shit in his 

536.99 540.07 B: right fresh wh- whatever was in his system 

539.48 552.00 A: he still had it in his system and he wasn't using that day he hasn't used since saturday probably or friday night but it's still enough of it in his system to fire him 'cause it's zero tolerance [noise] [noise] [noise] 

544.80 546.26 B: right right right 

548.94 549.98 B: (( mm mm )) 

550.08 554.32 B: mm and like you said that they probably using that abusive power 

554.60 566.62 B: to get rid of or alienate whoever they don't like or they catching the people and and they well i don't know if it's an invasion of privacy so much 

566.69 574.71 B: you know if it's illegal in a state then you gotta go and do whatever the state law just says or or prohibits or you know what i mean 

574.82 576.73 B: not so much as it being 

575.16 582.20 A: well yeah but you know invasion of privacy goes into like what's in your home and what's in your pockets you know 

581.29 582.55 B: yeah 

582.27 586.28 A: do they have a right to walk up to you and say let me see everything in your pockets 

585.49 586.79 B: (( right no )) 

586.35 594.92 A: if they don't have any reason to suspect you of doing anything except a drug test is more personal they're saying give me some of your blood or give me some of your urine to test 

593.70 595.97 B: mhm urine yeah [mn] 

595.17 599.89 A: and it makes you sa- say well what did i do they'll say we're just we're ju- we're just making su- 

598.10 599.02 B: (( yeah ))
