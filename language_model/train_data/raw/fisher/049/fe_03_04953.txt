7.84 8.79 B: (( how are you )) 

8.49 9.66 A: (( good how are you )) 

9.58 12.23 B: good what's your feelings on the subject 

12.34 15.61 A: yeah i think they do actually 

15.04 16.82 B: ah both or 

17.01 18.86 B: public and private or 

19.96 24.31 A: well defin- definitely private because i mean it's their school but i but i think in 

24.35 29.64 A: in public too 'cause i mean there's certain stuff that you don't want kids to be reading necessarily 

29.05 36.01 B: yeah i agree i think in in ah private ah they definitely have the right 

36.02 40.01 B: public i think they probably gotta be a little more choosy 

40.36 42.75 B: 'cause you're you know 

42.88 45.94 B: ah got a wide spectrum of ah 

47.28 50.13 B: probably issues or whatever but i think you know 

50.22 55.63 B: to give a responsibility to investigate before especially for private 

55.64 60.65 B: of what their polices are or what their curricular you know is or 

60.85 65.14 B: what their ah teaching schedule is or whatever 

64.66 66.00 A: right 

65.41 66.64 B: (( but ah )) 

67.68 77.28 B: you know w- i could see [mn] i know off the top of my head that i could see some private you know like a private military school is going to ah 

77.32 85.25 B: you know obviously i would think prohibit some books that maybe private would let in i mean ah public would let in 

84.87 86.73 A: right 

85.71 86.78 B: um 

86.86 90.10 A: yeah well private schools like you were saying it depends on you know 

90.36 99.89 A: what type of private school it is and what their belief system is and stuff like that so they like you were saying they might not let something in that a public school might 

95.29 96.36 B: yeah 

100.28 101.85 A: have 

101.46 107.00 B: yeah and now [mn] you know you you get into the subjects of religion and ah 

107.29 116.45 B: and not no you know no obviously the the bible and not knowing what some of the other religion's call their ah main books or whatever 

115.88 117.23 A: right 

116.59 118.32 B: but you know you you 

118.33 123.86 B: know ah you know [mn] the same thing came up on somewhat on the the ah 

124.17 126.53 B: you know the flag issue do you say 

126.63 130.72 B: ah you know pledge of allegiance and but you don't say 

130.99 135.79 B: the ah french or the german one and you might have students so 

135.86 142.94 B: you know it get's trickier what you're gonna to ah prohibit and who you're gonna piss off and 

142.12 144.95 A: [mn] we- [laughter] yeah that's true that's very true [noise] 

144.66 150.52 B: yeah and ah so i agree that p- p- maybe private has more of a 

151.02 153.37 B: a right to do it 

152.67 155.61 A: yeah because you know you're choosing to 

156.36 158.38 B: pay that kind of money for it 

157.33 167.33 A: pay that kind of money and to send your kid there and so you're you're knowing that this is the kind of education that they're gonna get and the kind of education you want so you wouldn't expect 

167.60 170.15 A: certain materials to be there 

169.81 180.48 B: but i think it's also ah on your shoulders don't complain three months in when you find out you know this or that is banned that you didn't check into before 

179.88 181.23 A: exactly 

180.67 186.20 B: ah you know then you start oh oh what do you mean this book isn't allowed in well you know 

186.02 187.28 A: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

186.66 194.66 B: are we supposed to sit down and tell you everything or is [mn] is it your responsibility to ask a few questions if you had concerns before you came in 

194.29 196.74 A: mhm [noise] and to know what's going on 

196.14 203.36 B: yeah to to [mn] to have a book that's in that you object to or to a book that's out that you think that should be in 

202.95 204.74 A: right yeah either way 

204.30 206.89 B: either way right ah 

206.65 210.64 A: yeah it's your responsibility to be educated on what's going on with your 

210.90 212.81 A: [noise] child's education [noise] [cough] [mn] 

213.00 221.18 B: but i think you get a little trickier when you start getting into taxpayers' money and ah [noise] [noise] ah and you know that kind of stuff 

221.34 223.70 B: [noise] and i i you know i guess the 

224.11 238.77 B: [noise] the region you're in or the the [noise] part of the country [noise] you're in would have a little somewhat bearing on it [noise] and [noise] ah [noise] ah you know if it's a in utah which is the mormons and the you know i'm sure it's gonna be 

238.65 246.27 B: their reading is gonna be a little di- their public school's gonna be different than ah the cities ah your jerseys or whatever 

242.76 244.20 A: right 

245.65 248.69 A: right yeah so you you can't be as 

248.91 252.02 A: i guess limited is maybe the word i'm trying to 

251.47 256.31 B: yeah well [mn] yeah it's the old [mn] the old story where do you draw the line 

256.40 261.61 B: you know somebody's always gonna be upset if something is in or something is not in 

258.68 259.74 A: right 

261.71 266.29 B: and they're think that it's you know they're being discriminated against or 

266.12 267.18 A: right 

266.56 269.19 B: or ah so it's not an easy call 

268.98 275.73 A: no it's not but there's there's certain material that you wouldn't necessarily want your third grader reading no matter 

275.01 277.65 B: oh you gr- granted yeah i think we could 

276.33 278.87 A: [laughter] no matter what persuasion you're from 

278.30 286.21 B: yeah i agree granted i think there's all we could all agree that there's some subjects of ah that shouldn't be in no matter w- private or public 

285.63 287.07 A: exactly 

286.35 288.07 B: yeah ah 

288.21 292.30 B: then and they probably are always gonna have ah somebody mad about that too 

292.33 293.18 A: oh 

292.37 295.40 B: even though you know ninety percent of the people think ah 

295.46 304.03 B: you know i don't know [mn] a lesbian or a gay themed books shouldn't be in and the you know up until the after the eighth or something and 

303.40 304.86 A: (( right [noise] )) 

304.23 309.10 B: you're gonna have some couples or same sex couples thinking 

308.15 314.62 A: well of course you're never gonna have a hundred percent agreement on anything for the most part but [noise] still you gotta go with you know 

315.19 320.04 A: [noise] what the majority thinks is de- decent and proper [noise] 

317.20 319.35 B: yeah and you know ah 

319.38 326.05 B: who's your principal and ah you know and you know or i don't i don't even know how it works if it ah 

321.71 322.55 A: right 

326.15 332.36 B: you know the subject if it's a principal decision or if it's a school board decision or 

331.51 337.71 A: oh that probably changes community by community that you're in too depending on how they have their system set up 

337.09 344.25 B: yeah you're right you know and i have probably you know now that you think about it some probably do leave it up to the teacher 

343.72 345.30 A: yeah that's true 

345.00 356.57 B: ah which is ah then you're really getting too too diversed out there or too many sub- too many people calling the shots and you're just asking for trouble but 

348.11 349.03 A: right 

353.59 354.83 A: right 

355.93 356.92 A: mhm 

356.67 359.27 B: (( but i don't know it's an interesting question )) 

359.10 360.30 A: yeah it is 

359.61 363.88 B: now that you think about it you know dwell on it and ah you 

364.50 367.10 B: know makes you think ah 'cause i have a ah i 

367.17 377.22 B: have a one that's gonna be a senior in high school next year and a daughter and it makes you wonder [mn] and just to go up and ask her wh- you know what are you reading these days [laughter] 

370.04 371.39 A: okay [mn] 

375.91 379.01 A: [laughter] yeah what are they actually teaching you there 

378.19 385.08 B: yeah yeah it makes you yeah it's it's a question i've never asked them maybe i will ask right after i hang up [laughter] 

382.51 384.03 A: [laughter] 

384.12 388.24 A: it's like wait a minute it made me think about something here [laughter] 

385.52 387.13 B: wait a minute that's a good 

387.47 390.43 B: yeah that's a good question [laughter] 

389.51 392.50 A: are you learning what i want to you to be learning [laughter] 

391.79 401.92 B: yeah what are you learning period you know ah yeah reading math and all that stuff and history well what else are you what are those wacky one periods we all used to have or whatever 

393.23 394.42 A: [laughter] 

400.69 402.73 A: [laughter] 

401.75 411.35 B: (( what are you what's got is there still home ec [laughter] [laughter] ah what are they or you know do they still teach you to sew or what are they teaching you these days [laughter] yeah )) 

403.76 406.82 A: [laughter] 

409.73 412.89 A: (( [laughter] what are they doing now [sigh] )) 

412.16 424.59 B: [laughter] yeah ah a terrorist or what but it is the it makes you wonder now where where who's m- who's making the call where do you draw the line in the sand 

412.92 413.99 A: oh 

417.10 417.78 A: (( my )) 

423.71 424.87 A: that's true 

424.70 427.80 B: yeah i never thought [mn] never gave it a thought 

428.07 433.54 B: ah still let 'em pay me for the call but but it is an eye opening ah question 

430.58 431.76 A: of course 

433.24 440.79 A: right yeah makes you think i think that's part of ah maybe what they're trying to do too i mean i don't know but [mn] 

434.91 436.12 B: yeah 

441.54 445.09 B: (( yeah yeah it's you know in the e- every once in a while you )) 

445.11 452.87 B: you know you see in the colleges that somebody's complaining about a sex ed course or it's too graphic or it's too 

452.81 453.99 A: right 

453.41 462.26 B: something going on and ah the you know they're watching not so much reading but they're watching porn or something and ah 

460.42 461.59 A: mhm 

462.40 469.97 B: you know and then you get the people that are up like i said before [mn] the taxpayers are up in arms we're paying for this and um 

470.31 471.40 A: right 

470.34 475.14 B: you know the guy's got tenure or something and they can't touch him and 

474.48 476.96 A: right they can't get him out of there bec- 

476.28 485.51 B: yeah they can't get him out of there and ah you know who paid for the movies and ah or the books or whatever they're doing 

481.89 483.14 A: right 

484.98 495.46 A: yeah tenure's another thing i mean i don't if a teacher's doing a bad job i don't care if he's been there thirty years [laughter] if he's not doing what he's supposed to be doing ah [laughter] something's wrong 

495.29 500.12 B: yeah and then like everything else with the budget cuts and everything you know the 

500.45 510.55 B: ah can you check on what everybody's reading but i i would think there's gotta be a a something and like you said before it maybe it does vary from community but there's gotta be 

510.52 520.02 B: i would think some kind of standard of there's gotta be a list i would think of what's definitely not acceptable and what is 

517.31 518.31 A: right 

519.96 531.73 B: ah you know of ah you know or it's maybe it's just some common sense you know like i don't know i've never seen it but as [mn] you know the more you read now that there's bomb making books out there 

531.14 532.49 A: right 

531.86 533.54 B: (( yeah you know )) 

533.65 535.14 B: is that like ah 

535.92 542.99 B: is is that a ah you know with all the common wisdom i would think is that that's a no no but 

542.36 543.92 A: right 

543.91 552.93 B: is there a list or is that up to discretion if a teacher feels that it's ah falls it's appropriate for what he's teaching or emphasizing 

552.32 555.63 A: right yeah there has to be some sort of accountability somewhere 

555.58 558.91 B: yeah or a review board or something 

558.29 559.85 A: right 

559.30 569.36 B: yeah maybe that's what it is maybe there is a there's the ah board of education maybe something there is a list and anything else above that list has to be approved or 

568.77 570.61 A: right yeah they gotta go 

570.54 571.70 B: yeah 

571.03 577.29 A: through someone so there's some sort of accountability ot- otherwise they're opening themselves up to a whole can of worms that they 

577.54 580.95 A: might not necessarily wanna get themselves involved with 

580.65 586.08 B: yeah ah and then they get into the i guess you get into i'm thinking about it you get into the question of even 

586.16 595.28 B: recommended reading you know not even that the school is ah supplying the book but what's to stop a teacher to recommend they read the 

594.70 595.85 A: right 

595.59 599.89 B: you know go to the library or go on the internet and and ah read this
