98.76 110.66 A: the inclines it's pretty much working everything you need to and it's isolating more of your upper chest so i don't do i wa- i was doing flats and then inclines but i got rid of the flats 

110.62 111.59 B: oh really 

111.27 113.17 A: and i'm just doing the inclines yeah

126.68 129.57 B: (( [laughter] maybe i should look into this [laughter] )) 

127.85 133.46 A: [laughter] yeah i it's it's it's fucking hard because like um 

134.72 141.12 A: [lipsmack] every like i've i've i've read a few sources you know i haven't read any books but just like internet and magazine and shit 

141.19 142.97 A: and uh 

141.52 142.23 B: mhm 

143.51 145.74 A: it everybody says something different 

145.98 146.89 A: so 

146.37 147.70 B: yeah 

147.48 149.51 A: (( how long have you been working out )) 

149.53 151.13 B: um [mn] 

151.36 154.57 B: off and on for about two or three years 

154.47 155.74 A: (( damn so )) 

154.99 162.62 B: but there's periods when i there are a couple of months where i haven't worked out and i just get in different [noise] phases you know [laughter] 

161.69 165.85 A: yeah tr- it's it's hard to keep it up definitely 

164.16 171.16 B: yeah especially like with school and stuff and you get busy and sometimes you just get out of it for a little bit which 

171.20 172.89 A: (( true true [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

171.91 173.26 B: kind of sucks 

174.27 175.65 B: (( but )) 

174.97 176.66 A: so what else uh 

178.34 180.03 A: you do the 

180.06 183.81 A: flats sometimes you do the inclines do butterflies 

184.08 185.93 B: yeah um 

184.92 187.71 A: do pretty much just work upper body or [mn] 

188.06 196.36 B: yeah it i don't do too much lower body i might every once in a while do like the leg press and the uh leg curls 

196.95 197.86 B: but 

198.72 205.25 B: mostly i i like through my running and whatever i i just feel that works my legs enough 

205.56 207.83 A: yeah true i'd 

206.20 207.08 B: so 

207.50 209.68 B: do you do your lower body at all or 

209.28 222.43 A: i'm kind of the same way i don't really well my the bench that i have is really cheap so it's you can only do upper body on it and so uh lower body i go bike riding so 

216.68 217.71 B: oh really 

221.94 223.12 B: (( yeah cool )) 

222.71 228.91 A: i think i mean i think running's probably better but bike riding i think is more fun for me 

228.79 231.52 B: yeah is it mountain biking or road 

231.44 235.56 A: nah it's just road um like i live in florida so 

231.57 232.72 B: (( road biking yeah )) 

235.79 241.75 A: most of florida's flat but um in tallahassee there's some hills so 

241.39 242.22 B: (( oh )) 

242.47 246.09 A: i don't really do there there are some trails around here but 

246.28 250.11 A: i don't really uh my bike's not quite equipped for that 

249.73 250.95 B: yeah 

250.99 251.84 A: (( [mn] oh )) 

251.40 257.86 B: that's cool i've i've wanted to get into that it looks pretty fun like how fast you can go on the road and stuff 

257.66 272.08 A: yeah oh yeah um yeah it's weird 'cause my bike's like it's actually kind of a mountain bike but i put road tires on it uh like not the the big knobby ones are for mountain biking you know 

264.00 264.85 B: uh-huh 

267.50 268.54 B: (( oh okay )) 

272.39 276.48 A: and like mine's like completely flat treads like road bikes 

276.86 278.97 B: oh does it work pretty good that way or 

277.20 278.13 A: just 

278.87 285.28 A: yeah i mean it's kind of so it's like kind of a hybrid like between uh road bikes and a mountain bike you know 

281.69 282.75 B: [laughter] 

285.70 287.35 A: (( it's kind of uh in between )) 

285.88 286.85 B: cool 

287.64 289.11 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

288.86 293.82 A: [mn] 'cause um i mean road bikes you can go faster but um 

293.90 294.75 A: (( but i )) 

295.28 300.83 A: don't know i just i feel sturdier on a like a mountain bike frame than i do on a road bike frame 

301.49 305.13 B: my buddy bought a road bike for like two thousand bucks 

304.94 306.28 A: (( [mn] oh shit wh- )) 

305.89 306.45 B: (( [mn] )) 

306.48 310.64 B: it's like super light you can lift it with your finger it's awesome 

309.10 311.98 A: yeah wha- what kind what is it made out of 

311.92 313.58 B: i think titanium 

313.31 314.58 A: (( oh damn )) 

314.30 315.50 B: [laughter] 

315.09 316.40 A: he's lucky 

316.39 317.54 B: (( yeah )) 

318.23 320.81 B: so he's he's really into it though 

320.73 329.48 A: [mn] yeah i've just got a regular steel frame i'd fucking love a titanium well i've got this i've got the steel frame that i'm riding now it's uh 

326.42 327.29 B: (( yeah )) 

329.27 336.41 A: pretty good though it's like eight five three chromolly steel which is a pretty pretty good as far as steel goes 

336.20 337.82 B: (( yeah )) 

336.89 340.69 A: and i don't really like aluminum and but i've got this um 

341.00 343.73 A: car- it's actually made out of carbon fibre 

344.33 351.28 A: and this frame that i haven't quite put together yet but i'm really excited about some day putting it together when i have money [mn] 

352.33 354.52 B: oh so you've just got the frame and then 

354.25 358.63 A: yeah well my yeah just right now i just have the frame and uh 

355.07 355.80 B: (( what oh )) 

357.69 358.62 B: (( okay [laughter] mm )) 

360.12 366.68 A: n- no components on it at all like it's just a bare frame and it's really light it's like i'm it's probably 

366.96 375.52 A: like steel is the heaviest i guess and then aluminum and then but aluminum's kind of cheap and then carbon fibre is probably a little bit lighter 

375.76 379.99 A: and then titanium is like the lightest and the strongest 

380.01 381.06 B: (( uh cool )) 

381.29 383.69 B: so you been doing it for a while the bike riding 

384.84 391.80 A: [mn] yeah well i mean i'm not like hard core hard core um you know it's kind of a casual thing 

391.82 393.02 B: yeah 

392.48 393.93 A: but i've been 

394.00 398.27 A: yeah i've been bike riding for a while i mean ever since i was a kid 

398.16 399.01 B: [laughter] 

398.70 403.91 A: um so i got you know a little more serious into it not too serious 

399.27 400.06 B: (( yeah )) 

404.18 414.13 A: 'cause i have en- i have too many things to be serious about [mn] like um you know just learning the basic repairs and learning a little bit more about it you know 

407.52 408.33 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

416.85 422.75 A: [mn] so so when you run is it like on a track or is it treadmill or what 

416.91 417.91 B: (( cool )) 

422.56 431.85 B: um lately it's just been at the gym like the treadmill thingy and um i used to run a lot outside when i was in high school

434.97 435.84 B: but 

435.92 439.82 B: i don't have time to put in the miles with it that i used to [noise] 

439.45 446.91 A: cool so how many miles do you do or like how often do you run and how many miles do you do per time 

445.97 447.17 B: um 

447.80 454.48 B: i've been kind of slacking lately but usually three three or four times a week i'll do about three miles each 

455.36 457.69 B: but in high school i'd do like f- 

455.93 457.31 A: (( the amount each time )) 

458.16 460.99 B: probably forty or fifty miles a week
