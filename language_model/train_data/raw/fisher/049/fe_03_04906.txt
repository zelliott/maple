0.00 1.47 A: hi this is tim 

1.38 2.64 B: (( hi )) 

2.71 3.76 B: jasmin 

4.22 5.32 A: pardon me 

4.99 6.60 B: my name is jasmin 

6.56 8.30 A: hello jasmin how are you 

8.08 9.34 B: okay 

9.04 10.43 A: good 

10.73 23.78 A: well i guess to start off the conversation um i do not feel that it's uh an invasion of privacy for an employer to uh do random drug tests i feel it's uh 

23.90 30.24 A: uh the person who owns the business uh is taking all the risk 

30.14 43.21 A: and uh they need to have the best uh employees they can and if uh some of the plo- employees are on drugs and maybe can't do their job to their full capacity i uh i think the employer has the full right to know that 

43.10 46.98 B: that's right you're right that's right a hundred percent right 

47.23 51.79 A: and i think also that if someone is in a position that uh 

51.85 56.49 A: they you know don't want to be drug tested well you know then they can find a new job 

56.39 58.08 B: that's right go somewhere else 

58.16 60.27 A: yeah do you feel that way 

58.25 59.59 B: that's right 

59.94 63.17 B: yeah i feel the same way i mean hit the road you know 

62.75 65.04 A: yeah uh you know it's it's 

65.20 78.20 A: hard enough right now to find quality employees for uh a lot of uh different positions and once you do find one you want to make sure that uh uh that you hold on to them and uh you know you can weed out the ones who uh 

75.13 76.36 B: (( that's right )) 

78.31 82.36 A: you know who really don't want to be there and and i think that's 

79.92 82.99 B: that's right somebody's gonna do the right thing 

82.80 84.21 A: yes yeah 

83.29 86.33 B: so right from the word normal not off balance 

85.71 89.08 A: yeah yeah exactly and i think also that uh 

89.02 102.07 A: um you know the person like i said who is your employer they're the one who's taking all the risk what what if something happens uh that this person's at work and uh say they're on some type of uh drug and they hurt themselves 

93.96 95.37 B: (( exactly )) 

102.03 103.40 B: that's right that's not the 

102.17 105.45 A: you know what do they do they they may come back and sue the company 

105.48 107.87 A: uh even though they were on drugs 

105.72 107.22 B: (( that's right )) 

107.65 109.05 B: that's right 

108.08 110.46 A: an and then that person loses out 

110.13 112.58 B: that's right he can jeopardize other people there too 

112.36 123.91 A: oh absolutely yeah you're a hundred percent correct you can you know you can jeopardize other people around you you know i mean i'm sure i know in my job uh you know i wouldn't want to work around a lot of people who uh 

118.30 119.61 B: (( that's right )) 

123.81 130.81 A: you know aren't fully capable of doing their job uh and knowing that i you know i could get hurt in the process 

130.55 133.45 B: that's right that's right you're right you're right 

131.48 132.26 A: yeah 

132.49 137.50 A: yeah that that's that's uh oh that's just kinda how i feel and i think uh 

135.09 136.24 B: (( a hundred percent )) 

136.77 147.03 B: that's the truth ex- exactly the way it supposed to be that way not the other kinda way it should always be that kinda way i think that's a i think that's a hundred percent plus one what it you know 

145.82 147.18 A: well you 

147.53 148.79 A: (( go ahead )) 

148.34 158.07 B: you know that people like that don't need to be coming unfunctional working around people's business and they can like i say get hurt you know and plus jeopardize a man's business too 

157.91 160.58 A: yeah yeah i mean you know i i don't 

158.51 159.51 B: you know 

159.54 168.33 B: why put them like put the million dollars in somebody else's account by mistake because you have a drug you putting a million dollars in somebody's account working in a bank you know 

166.26 167.40 A: yeah oh sure 

167.97 169.29 A: yeah yeah 

168.60 171.68 B: for one mistake because you got the drugs in your body 

171.20 173.12 A: yes yeah that's true 

171.99 174.34 B: and that that's not good you know 

173.46 176.48 A: no no and you know i mean everybody loses 

176.34 177.56 B: exactly 

176.48 180.46 A: you know everybody loses because you know even say you're uh 

180.35 191.01 A: say you're in a manufacturing company and you're you're trying to build things and if you can't build them correctly or if you know if it's not done to the expectations of your of your employer 

182.53 183.43 B: right 

190.80 204.99 A: then your whole ah product is put in jeopardy you know any anything that you turn out may be defective and that could you know that's gonna cost the company time money and uh you know and may maybe even uh 

194.43 195.88 B: that's right 

204.84 206.80 A: you know the employee's job

307.00 308.79 B: and test everybody out 

308.41 311.61 A: yeah that's true and uh i don't think uh 

311.68 320.10 A: like you said before it you know it doesn't help anyone you know it puts it puts everybody at it puts a you know a lot of other people at risk and and uh 

314.85 316.15 B: no it don't 

319.23 323.72 B: yeah yes it do a hundred percent i mean a corporation business you know

361.05 371.97 A: you know go get the help you know go get the help that you need because it is out there you know get it taken care of and and then you know come back and fo- and and you know that's another cost that these companies have to incur 

362.44 364.05 B: that's right 

365.39 366.52 B: and sure 

371.98 373.84 B: that's right 

372.15 386.55 A: you know they gotta put they gotta they have to put these programs out for people who you know either are you know drug addicts or alcoholics or whatever and and it's just another cost to the company and it's passed on to the consumer because it's gotta be passed on to the you know through the uh 

378.54 379.79 B: (( that's right )) 

383.35 384.71 B: that's right 

386.47 393.01 A: uh you know incremental costs that it costs each you know each company to make product a 

388.75 389.60 B: right 

392.82 394.15 B: that's right 

393.29 396.24 A: and and that's gonna you know uh affect the cost so 

395.67 399.13 B: that's right it makes the whole thing go down for one person 

398.79 405.31 A: yeah yeah right er yeah you're exactly right and it's you know i like i said i'm i i have no problem 

404.27 407.95 B: and it's gonna cost them more money to put out you know 

406.56 416.40 A: yes absolutely yeah your product a will cost more money because because of that person who uh you know is on drugs and um 

410.17 412.07 B: that's right 

415.39 416.46 B: that's right 

416.41 420.50 A: i you know i i like i said you know i have no problem with them being tested 

420.62 426.31 A: uh at any time and i don't know wh- where you work but i mean i know where i work um 

420.67 422.29 B: (( oh no me either )) 

425.46 426.35 B: right 

426.43 437.49 A: it would be you know for me to do my job i it would be impossible for me to do my jro- job if i were uh you know on any type of controlled substance and and i think uh 

435.87 436.87 B: right 

438.24 449.61 A: i think in most people's you know position to be able to have to not uh be subject to a rule like that or a uh you know 

447.52 448.78 B: (( that's right )) 

449.68 454.61 A: having a rule like that it's just gonna be able to put more in jeopardy you know 

453.67 456.87 B: that's yeah you're actually you're right you sure is right 

455.58 456.39 A: yeah 

456.57 457.82 A: yeah so 

457.19 462.72 B: so that i wouldn't jeopardize my whole business less some one person made the whole haystack go down 

462.42 469.52 A: yeah right and it's good you know it's good that everybody you know or it's good that we think that way because you know what we can be examples 

469.56 471.85 B: that's right private examples 

469.96 471.19 A: you know we can 

471.38 483.95 A: yes exactly you know we can be and and that's what makes america great you know i mean there's people like you and i that are made up that have this moral background and have this uh you know ability to know what's right and what's wrong 

475.39 476.81 B: that's right 

483.73 489.72 B: right when in years to come they always their bodies broke down because they they'd abused their body with the drugs 

487.01 487.91 A: sure 

489.36 490.68 A: yeah yes 

489.99 494.82 B: and now they want to get there and still want to be on drugs they still want to break the company down you know 

494.13 496.07 A: (( yeah yeah yeah it's )) 

494.83 499.91 B: you know they ju- just just something wrong with these people you know and they just they just messed up everything you know 

499.58 506.53 A: yeah well that's true yeah that's very true and you know it's harder and harder every day that you know to be able to 

501.19 502.11 B: you know 

504.14 509.87 B: that's right i mean every second going by somebody's being worsening that it got to be you 

509.25 512.69 A: yeah i agree with that i agree with that 

511.27 520.90 B: know and they should just not just not win you know they you know they just need to stop bringing that stuff into this country because this country's going so far down the hill that they don't get to see it you know 

520.60 534.11 A: well and you know i think a a lot of it has to do with like you mentioned before or like the question is you know is it taking someone's uh right away from them you know the right of privacy well you know what i mean i 

530.51 531.73 B: oh right 

534.84 546.31 A: i think freedoms aren't a right they're they have to be earned and you have to you have to you know everybody has to live under the rule of law because if we don't you know everything 

538.46 539.90 B: exactly 

544.87 547.26 B: the place would be like the cave people days 

547.08 549.40 A: yeah yeah i mean it everything 

548.19 549.60 B: just like them 

549.36 563.80 A: yeah it'll be you know it it'll be just everybody for themselves and and you know our country has to be founded our country was founded on being able to work together and everybody being able to work together as a team and and and you know 

552.49 553.84 B: (( exactly and )) 

558.71 560.00 B: that's right 

561.57 562.67 B: right 

562.92 567.36 B: it's like basketball just like hockey everybody got to work as a team 

565.34 566.27 A: yeah 

567.04 576.26 A: yeah you need to work as a team you know you need to work as as uh you know everyone needs to work together from the top down and and i know like my company um 

576.28 584.22 A: you know i'm not the president but you know what would i like to be the president well you know if i work hard enough some day i may be able to you know 

580.26 581.13 B: right 

584.30 590.98 A: get into a position where you know my what i say has more authority than what it does right now 

590.77 591.91 B: (( that's right )) 

590.78 599.95 A: and if if if you know drug testing is is one of the ways that it you know you're gonna weed people out or you're going to be able to you know get the
