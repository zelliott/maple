0.62 2.58 A: hi my name's lisa 

0.69 1.59 B: (( [mn] )) 

2.49 4.17 B: hi my name is rita 

4.89 5.87 A: (( how're you doing )) 

5.62 6.96 B: (( hi lisa )) 

6.84 8.58 A: [laughter] where you from 

8.66 10.59 B: i'm from new york what about you 

10.45 14.31 A: same here new york city right in manhattan [laughter] yeah 

11.85 13.75 B: (( okay great )) 

14.02 18.02 B: [laughter] last week i had the topic was movies so this is interesting 

16.76 28.46 A: yeah it is actually this one is really good uh i've actually been at jobs where i have uh one of the requirements before you even get hired is to be dr- drug tested and 

18.84 20.20 B: yeah 

20.35 21.70 B: yeah 

27.10 33.59 B: yeah you know in fact i spoke to someone recently a doctor we were hiring and it's common practice now [mn] 

33.18 41.55 A: yeah it is extremely 'cause supposedly the research is is that uh there's actual loss of work as far as 

41.40 52.76 A: hours and and productivity and what have you from people who use drugs and be- being out and what have you so companies see how much they're actually losing in money and in productivity 

50.64 52.22 B: (( [noise] [mn] right )) 

52.53 62.52 A: and apparently it's a significant loss enough to warrant them to want to implement drug testing although i think it's a big huge infringement on a person's privacy uh 

61.40 68.44 B: oh so that's at the beginnings of that 'cause i was in the military and that was my first experience with drug 

62.67 63.72 A: (( you know it's )) 

68.72 82.58 B: uh urine uh uh testing and then w- we would have ru- random spots we would we it it mi- you know it wherever we were if they had required that at that moment we had to do a drug test we had to stop what we were doing and and report 

82.43 87.26 B: for testing but in the military you have no rights they own you so there's no problem 

83.71 84.57 A: (( a )) 

86.80 91.53 A: oh [mn] oh th- th- th- oh yeah you trade off all those benefits in the military [noise] 

87.92 89.82 B: yeah mhm 

90.91 103.96 B: exactly [laughter] and you would be of course out of the military if you were if they find drugs in your urine but when i my de- my department job before i was employed i had to do a urine [sigh] drug test but i never had to do it before 

95.80 96.77 A: yeah 

103.91 107.42 A: yeah no i've i've done it for little jobs like in retail 

107.42 110.55 B: oh for retail that's interesting [laughter] 

107.43 109.01 A: you know just working at 

109.82 113.95 A: yeah retail they'll actually do drug testing i remember uh 

113.92 123.92 A: k- i was hired one time by k-mart to work in stock and they did drug testing i remember i worked for woolworth's when it was still in business and they did drug testing also 

123.75 133.23 A: and i know everybody who works everybody that i know who works for like the city or the federal government they get drug tested initially before being hired and it's just random all the time after that 

130.00 131.17 B: right 

132.64 143.14 B: exactly i mean you know it's funny because it's i've gotten so accustomed to it that i haven't really questioned it too much in terms of the infringe- infringement of someone's privacy 

139.17 140.16 A: yeah 

143.24 152.10 B: but you know i've certain views on drug use so and you know what i'm the medical director for a drug program we have in my job facility yeah 

146.30 147.32 A: yeah 

150.36 151.39 A: really 

151.77 153.73 A: wow that's 

152.57 156.79 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] so i guess i [noise] [noise] [noise] 

155.25 156.43 A: (( [cough] i think it's a matter )) 

156.66 170.49 A: it's a matter of a person's uh you know it's their right if they wanna be you know 'cause you've got people that are functional addicts and if they come into work everyday and they're not late and they do the job they're supposed to do i don't see what the big deal is if they choose to use drugs that's their business 

170.00 171.38 B: right 

170.30 183.57 A: but i don- but no one should test to find out who is or who isn't i think that's kind of really wrong and the thing is is is it's actually supposed to be against the law not to hire someone because [noise] of it but they do it anyway 

175.49 176.64 B: right 

182.62 194.94 B: oh that's interesting you know what happens in in in where i work if if they've let's see if there's a a a parent who's a a c._f. case for child's welfare uh 

184.59 185.69 A: yeah 

190.69 191.91 A: mhm 

194.05 195.66 A: mhm 

194.94 199.84 B: and if they find that their urine is positive they can take their children away 

200.01 201.64 A: (( wow that's bad )) 

200.72 213.35 B: yeah not all children i'm not sure what the criteria is in terms of whose children are taken away maybe if it's a recurrent problem they'll take the children away that'd be cause for for removing the children 

213.19 214.59 A: (( that seems selfish no )) 

214.02 227.30 B: i haven't yeah i haven't really kept up with the laws of the of the again the infringement of of privacy but i have to certainly follow the guidelines that i have at work but you know once we've done the urine [lipsmack] 

226.99 228.35 A: mhm 

227.93 237.69 B: uh tests initially we don't get we don't have random urine testing but i've had parents come in requesting their [mn] children their adolescent 

231.04 232.16 A: mhm 

237.58 243.89 B: children uh children um get tested and i don't feel comfortable doing that i won't do that 

237.65 238.58 A: (( interesting )) 

242.73 247.26 A: (( uh yeah i don't like that either if you can't tell the signs uh )) 

244.15 245.63 B: (( i know [sigh] )) 

247.14 258.80 A: of your child if they're on uh you know using because if you can't see the signs without a urine test then i need to question your ability as a parent period are you paying attention to them are you are you really paying attention to them you know 

254.73 257.83 B: exactly and i think there's a better way 

258.30 269.71 B: exactly i agree and then you know testing their urine rather then having open communication with your child and your concern i think that's a better way to approach it than doing a urine test 

264.95 266.21 A: mhm 

269.46 273.29 A: and it actually really shatters the trust between a child and a parent 

272.22 282.34 B: oh absolutely i i put myself in a child's shoes i don't even put my [laughter] i mean i'm old enough to be the parent but i put myself in the child's shoes 'cause i think it's wrong 

276.75 277.77 A: (( mm )) 

282.07 288.20 A: 'cause we want adolescents to be independent and we want to teach them to be adults yet we teach them like children and 

287.63 292.97 B: i know i know exactly i know exactly what you're saying [sigh] that's um 

288.23 289.76 A: (( doing something like that would )) 

291.93 294.90 A: it's the do as i say not as i do syndrome 

294.90 295.90 B: right 

294.92 299.62 A: (( that the parents are always doing yeah i hear that a lot all the time it's really sad it's )) 

298.38 300.75 B: mhm mhm 

299.51 302.92 A: amazing the little the littlest menial job 

302.73 316.62 A: (( and you you end up having to do drug testing like in you know we have some factory places will do it i've heard about you know some friends who [sigh] work and stuff like that at factories i mean i you know they sent they'll send you to a medical place and i'm like why am i being sent to a medical like this for a drug test )) 

316.42 321.06 A: i remember i worked for macy's and they did that also but everyone knows the policy 

316.71 317.86 B: (( mhm )) 

320.21 321.58 B: wow 

321.65 324.18 A: yeah a big store like that [laughter] 

321.71 322.77 B: so you 

323.98 330.61 B: wow so what happens to the employee if they do have a positive urine test are they [mn] they are they fired 

328.78 330.14 A: (( [mn] well )) 

330.21 338.22 A: they well the paper work that you sign and that they give you says that they won't and that they do not discriminate against that 

338.22 339.32 B: but it is 

338.45 344.60 A: but but they won't hire you if they find you positive i'm po- i'm sure of it you know so you know they 

341.39 342.48 B: right 

342.59 347.88 B: mhm i agree they may not even tell the pro- the prospective employee maybe 

347.37 359.29 A: exactly i'm sure they won't ah as far as i know they in the literature that they give you to sign no one reads anything before they sign it of course that they don't have to disclose to you whether or not it was a positive or negative 

347.92 349.26 B: do they tell them 

349.43 350.38 B: (( why )) 

359.13 360.26 B: wow 

359.43 364.72 A: which i think is really messed up all the time i get at least let the person know what it is you're not hiring them for 

364.71 367.21 B: exactly no i agree with that 

364.79 365.81 A: (( you know )) 

367.22 377.17 A: but um people are getting uh hip to all of that and they're finding out uh a lot of stuff to be able to hide the drugs that they're using and going into health food stores and finding a bunch of stuff that 

376.22 378.58 B: oh yeah uh-huh 

378.10 383.49 A: they're getting real sick on that the one thing that they can't um beat is a hair analysis test 

383.71 384.84 B: (( mm )) 

383.95 387.71 A: unless they read high times and then they can find something to beat even the hair analysis 

387.42 388.81 B: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

388.55 395.97 A: there are tests that you can send away for that they order them from either europe or california that'll beat both urine and hair analysis 

393.60 394.96 B: mhm 

396.38 397.44 B: wow 

396.73 409.60 A: which also i thought was rather interesting although some people are really getting hip to it because i used to work at a a health food store and we used to sell products like that and we had cops firemen transit workers 

399.68 400.49 B: i think 

409.78 412.12 A: postal workers they were all buying it 

412.02 414.87 B: (( [lipsmack] wow i don't know i don't even know what to [laughter] )) 

413.08 415.33 A: (( and then we knew they were all using )) 

414.72 429.03 B: exactly and i don't know if i find that a little discouraging i don't know i mean [sigh] you know it is funny 'cause i never passed judgement on people who use drugs but i wonder why these lot of people use drugs [laughter] i have no understanding of that i don't know 

422.49 423.42 A: (( mm )) 

428.84 432.64 A: (( well i think one is addictive personality that's part of it )) 

431.20 436.28 B: if you're addictive personality right a quick fix quick cure quick good feel 

432.91 434.48 A: yeah and 

435.91 440.15 A: exactly and then the other one is is escapism we're living in a very 

437.00 438.33 B: yeah 

440.05 452.13 B: i know and i totally agree with that i i've made my i have probably my own way of doing it and i don't even realize it [laughter] you know it's it's it's a tough world we live in it's tough 

441.06 442.77 A: harsh world now 

443.33 444.12 A: (( mm )) 

447.75 449.15 A: mhm 

449.36 450.52 A: yeah 

451.99 454.49 A: exactly so that's really what it's all about 

452.93 453.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

454.37 457.38 B: yeah [lipsmack] no you're right 

457.37 457.93 A: (( [mn] )) 

457.61 461.64 B: so i guess i i don't really feel like it is fair to the person 

461.65 464.99 B: it is an invasion of their infringement on their privacy 

463.94 466.05 A: yep yeah 

465.19 468.58 B: i definitely think i feel that way despite my my role 

468.40 469.65 A: mhm 

469.02 478.00 B: you know i think uh someone uh you know voluntarily can do it or if there's a question of you know in terms of a safety child- child safety 

473.30 474.27 A: yeah 

477.80 478.63 A: yeah 

478.11 482.33 B: i feel that it it probably is okay you know i don't know 

480.88 483.22 A: i think child or public safety 

482.85 484.95 B: yeah exactly 

483.97 493.06 A: people operating heavy machinery or like in construction or some- someone's operating a train going at you know a hundred and fifty two hundred miles per hour that kind of thing 

492.84 506.36 A: i definitely want to know whether or not that person is under the influence there you know other people's uh safety and wellbeing are in their hands but other than that for the casual worker i mean someone who's just going to be working a cash register or 

492.91 494.03 B: right 

497.88 499.36 B: (( lives right )) 

505.62 507.47 B: (( right or the you know )) 

506.38 515.19 A: a floor person you know something like for that or somebody who's just a delivery person i don't see any reason we should have to drug test them i just [mn] 

513.78 515.85 B: [noise] [noise] i agree with that 

516.10 517.15 A: (( i don't think we shoul- )) 

516.15 517.36 B: yeah i agree 

517.46 525.01 A: i think what's going to end up happening is you're going to end up having more designer drugs that are going to be undetectable on tests 

524.10 527.15 B: testable mhm mhm 

526.06 534.45 A: 'cause that's what i think is going to end up happening so uh it- it's just a matter of time now before that actually happens people will get very hip to it you know that's the 

528.17 529.52 B: i think so 

533.17 534.46 B: right 

534.66 540.38 A: [noise] that'll be the new and latest thing and then the only way you probably able to do something to actually test 

540.45 543.68 A: will be on the genetic level maybe to see if someone's been using 

543.54 545.11 B: wow could you imagine 

543.71 544.84 A: you know or 

545.15 554.01 A: yeah or what they might do in the future too is try to um look for people who have genetic predispositions to have to use drugs 

553.22 555.92 B: (( this is ju- [mn] oh wow )) 

555.43 557.33 A: and eliminate them entirely 

557.29 558.65 B: mhm 

557.38 563.70 A: (( from society so that's what that's again it's only a matter of time in my opinion before that happens so )) 

563.60 571.69 B: could you imagine not hiring someone 'cause they had the genetic tendency to have the to be have an addictive [laughter] personality that's 

570.14 578.79 A: yeah exactly 'cause you thi- 'cause you think the evidence yeah they're gonna end up usi- [mn] yeah that's a bigtime invasion of private discrimination that's really gonna be 

572.23 574.72 B: complete invasion of privacy 

576.03 578.06 B: mhm 

578.64 591.09 A: an elite society that literally will be the new world order or imagine the chip that they want to install in everyone that will have all your information and will also be able to let people know when you're using and when you're not you know that's [cough] 

585.92 588.37 B: [laughter] exactly 

589.93 590.53 B: (( [laughter] )) 

590.90 593.56 B: right the- they're tightening up 

592.24 593.66 A: it literally will 

593.76 599.89 A: it'll literally be able to track you and let the government know where you're at and exactly when you're using and they'll cat- and they'll 

598.52 599.82 B: (( [noise] right ))
