97.96 108.42 B: [cough] so i mean well what i mean do you i mean i was curious i mean actually it's a coincidence that this is the topic today i mean do you keep count like when you when you're doing any kind of exercise 

108.44 117.25 B: do you also keep count on your uh you know calorie intake or you just go out and do as much you can and just eat whatever you have 

117.52 120.78 A: i don't really pay attention to what i eat 

117.56 119.89 B: (( and do you try and balance uh-huh )) 

121.76 130.83 A: i like when i did that that program they have like kind of a diet outlined with it and i sort of stuck with it but not really [noise] 

127.31 128.38 B: okay 

130.70 131.68 B: mhm 

132.37 141.18 B: mhm okay yeah because i mean i have uh i mean i i was i've been reading you know the internet that how you can calculate uh 

141.15 149.39 B: you know how much uh you should take in for your weight and age and all that stuff so i mean i mean i would uh 

146.42 147.40 A: right 

149.48 161.26 B: you know uh i don't know how much they really really matter i mean uh if uh you follow the uh the diet they prescribe because uh i mean i uh i used to run like uh 

161.32 166.34 B: you know to might be two two miles three miles a day on the treadmill 

166.23 167.19 A: really 

166.43 180.11 B: for like yeah uh but and uh you know i would uh definitely not exceed two thousand calories a day but still you know the effect wasn't uh you know as drastic as they say it would be for 

180.33 182.31 B: (( you know you follow what they say )) 

182.56 191.07 B: so i just went back to my own you know food habit and i would i would just uh exercise to be healthy i mean it wasn't uh

429.95 435.52 B: but i mean it's okay uh you know it's only three times isn't it three times that we have to talk [lipsmack] 

433.13 434.69 A: [laughter]

448.52 450.00 B: (( yeah [cough] )) 

450.35 451.81 A: (( from this i mean you )) 

452.17 456.11 B: i mean i i'm still trying to figure out what's the purpose of uh 

456.20 460.69 B: of this whole survey thing i mean what are they trying [noise] people talk 

461.72 462.65 B: (( on the )) 

461.86 462.99 A: (( know how no )) 

462.69 465.88 B: phone or how people from different nationalities talk or 

465.89 467.46 B: [laughter] 

466.50 469.25 A: yeah i'm really not sure it's interesting though 

468.96 474.75 B: i mean yeah it's really interesting i mean and it's a university it's a survey from the university so 

474.62 476.51 A: yeah 

475.36 479.60 B: one guy told me that they're just trying to track down you know for this 

479.67 489.19 B: uh where you have this automated you know voice service that uh you know you say something and they have some uh receiver and it kind of uh 

489.32 492.55 B: understands what you said and then gives a response 

492.65 497.86 B: accordingly so i think this is what they're trying to because of uh 

492.69 493.66 A: oh really 

497.83 503.02 B: you know since you have people from different different countries and different background and they all 

502.99 516.89 B: uh say things in different ways and pronounce a word in different ways so they try to get uh you know all possible ways people pronounce uh any given word so that uh you know their system can understand it uh 

516.94 518.07 B: better than 

518.50 520.39 B: you know how it's doing now 

520.29 521.11 A: huh 

520.52 522.77 B: sometimes i've seen yeah i mean since i'm 

522.58 525.21 B: you know uh because i have felt this uh 

525.01 539.19 B: as you know i'm from india and the way i speak english or the way i pronounce certain words are different from how you guys do here so what happens like if for example you know i call up sprint and they have this whole automated thing now 

532.96 533.91 A: right 

539.70 548.49 B: [mn] and it uh asks you to give them some like you know key words so that they can understand that what exactly you want and therefore they can route your call 

548.54 552.19 B: you know rather than you know some live operator talking to you 

552.10 556.82 A: right we have a system that we just implemented like that at where i work 

552.69 554.09 B: (( so in the )) 

556.40 558.21 B: right so in 

557.00 562.60 A: yeah and it like a lot of people end up going to the mac tech support when they're actually on p._c.s now 

562.53 563.86 B: (( right so )) 

563.26 564.78 A: so [laughter] 

564.80 571.23 B: [laughter] well yeah i mean exactly i mean you know i i say something but it says that i couldn't i couldn't understand your 

564.89 565.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

571.12 584.40 B: i couldn't understand your well you know what you said and i have to say that again and again [mn] and finally it would somehow be able to track what i said but you know like so at times i mean you know they're used to 

577.40 577.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

580.23 581.48 A: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

584.49 597.66 B: might be hearing the american way of pronouncing some word when they listen to hear me my you know accent then sometimes it gets uh it doesn't understand so it could be that is the reason [noise] they are trying to 

597.91 599.89 B: you know increase their pool of
