351.76 354.87 A: but uh do you do you think that there's too much sports on t._v. 

355.62 360.24 B: well absolutely not because there's such a big market and it's such a big money maker 

360.67 363.72 B: you know generates a lot of income for a lot of people 

363.12 364.37 A: yeah that's true 

363.88 372.40 B: and uh of course i wish i could get one of these jobs on either side you know on the broadcasting side or even just selling the peanuts 

372.57 377.39 A: yes but i don't you know i i look at football as being just like 

377.40 379.00 A: back in the

391.57 392.53 B: yeah 

393.90 399.85 B: well yeah you're right i mean they should just uh you know drop all pretense and bring that gladiator stuff back 

399.22 405.51 A: yeah but everybody seems to be crazy about you know specially football and um 

405.55 409.27 A: basketball people a lot of people are crazy about football i mean baseball also 

409.30 414.67 B: [lipsmack] oh yeah absolutely but uh you know all these players are so overpriced like i got 

414.53 424.08 B: totally burned out in following the braves 'cause all these baseball strikes and you know it's like i used to work on the road and i'd start getting into watching 

418.80 419.95 A: yeah 

423.88 431.78 B: you know sports on t._v. football and baseball when i was stuck in hotel rooms all the time that's when i got sucked into it but then once they

432.33 439.14 B: you know start complaining about the money it's like man what are you complaining about i mean you're making more than anybody i know and anybody i'll ever know 

439.97 440.95 A: oh 

440.10 444.99 B: they're just they're so spoiled i tell you it just totally turns me off of watching 

442.12 444.07 A: (( yeah )) 

444.82 449.26 A: yeah they do make a lot of money [sigh] a lot of money 

448.01 458.29 B: it and i don't deny them that because whatever the market will bear ray you know if you can get away with it sh- shoot go for it but don't be complaining about it 

455.75 457.17 A: yeah that's true 

457.69 458.52 A: no 

458.85 460.39 B: that's crazy
