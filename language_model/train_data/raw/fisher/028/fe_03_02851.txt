152.25 153.23 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

152.62 161.71 B: and i don't do it that often and my second favorite thing to watch on t._v. would be horse racing but i don't do that that often either 

161.48 166.72 A: [noise] [noise] oh all right well do you bet on do you bet on the horses or are you just like to watch the horse races 

165.89 178.18 B: i do bet on the horses but not when i watch them on t._v. i bet on them when they run here at del mar which unfortunately is only forty three days a year it's uh they run uh late july to early september
