252.64 253.31 B: (( [sigh] )) 

259.46 261.91 B: (( i agree oh ))

279.40 285.03 B: wow yeah they just built a new stadium round here in denver i guess they replaced the mile high stadium 

285.09 286.09 B: and uh 

285.22 286.04 A: oh 

286.63 289.58 B: um i don't remember the name of the new one 

289.60 295.31 B: but they were selling sod to people around here to plant in their yards from the field 

294.79 295.98 A: from the old one 

295.60 300.58 B: yeah yeah and it was really really expensive too [laughter] 

296.46 298.36 A: oh have a little piece of history 

299.94 303.03 A: [laughter] well they were selling the old seats from our stadium here 

302.55 305.33 B: [noise] oh really huh wow 

303.30 307.35 A: mhm but um don't know the what the heck anybody would do with them but 

306.72 309.00 B: yeah exactly exactly 

308.99 312.28 A: i mean uh th- they look nice for the players when they play 

311.89 312.99 B: mhm 

312.57 316.82 A: but [sigh] i don't know i really think they're the ones that should pay for it not us 

316.81 318.90 B: yeah yeah i agree 

318.78 332.60 A: and as for football and baseball on t._v. [noise] i just don't think there's enough action [noise] and quite frankly watching basketball on t._v. i just don't see where the big thrill is there because half the players almost as tall as the hoop 

323.81 325.07 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

332.18 337.38 B: [noise] [lipsmack] [sigh] y- [mn] yeah i agree i uh i totally agree with that and then they're so 

336.62 337.77 A: (( [noise] )) 

337.48 342.26 B: you know paid so well also but they can reach the hoop on their toes if even 

342.05 344.81 A: right so i mean where's the challenge 

342.58 343.52 B: yeah 

344.14 346.17 B: [noise] yes yes 

345.37 351.70 A: you know at least in hockey they gotta get that little puck across the ice through people's legs [noise] 

346.18 346.74 B: [noise] 

349.90 356.22 B: yeah yeah that is pretty interesting hockey it seems like a really hard sport [noise] 

353.24 354.03 A: oh 

354.47 360.31 A: [noise] i like getting them played on that slippery ice to boot [noise] 

359.07 361.71 B: exactly on little blades on their feet 

361.37 365.89 A: yeah yeah i don't know how the heck they don't fall [laughter] 

361.84 363.10 B: [laughter] 

364.34 366.64 B: right right no kidding 

366.55 367.98 A: no and then 

368.04 372.57 A: well you know most of them don't have their own teeth no [mn] 

370.70 371.74 B: oh really 

372.34 374.87 B: oh my gosh [laughter] 

373.41 376.52 A: no do you know how many hockey players have their teeth knocked out 

375.85 379.02 B: [laughter] yeah i guess a lot of 'em would huh [laughter] 

378.26 381.56 A: yeah yeah well i know quite a few players that's why 

379.56 380.59 B: wow 

381.57 384.30 A: and most of them have false teeth in front 

381.70 382.91 B: oh really 

384.20 386.80 B: wow my gosh 

385.32 386.13 A: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

386.41 389.79 A: but then again i'm sure some of the football players do as well 

389.46 391.24 B: yeah yeah 

391.17 392.36 A: i would assume 

392.47 393.94 B: yeah probably 

392.98 394.00 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

394.07 395.22 A: oh and then 

394.11 396.34 B: yeah i guess a lot of 'em would [noise] 

395.91 401.31 A: and then you look at them and i'm thinking you're they're getting paid all this money to play something they love to do 

400.98 403.33 B: yeah yeah hm 

403.25 404.74 A: it's just not right 

404.19 409.49 B: [laughter] i agree yeah i like to garden i should become a professional gardener [laughter] 

407.77 414.19 A: [laughter] [noise] oh don't you i mean i understand though playing football it's probably hard to move around with all that 

414.30 417.73 B: yeah yeah and you definitely get beat up [laughter] 

415.11 416.42 A: equipment on 

417.53 422.67 A: yeah i don't know but the hockey players even off their skates a lot of 'em are pretty tall 

422.90 424.18 B: are they really 

423.75 425.02 A: mhm oh 

424.22 426.72 B: huh i never realized that 

425.37 432.38 A: and what about the baseball players chewing tobacco spitting adjusting themselves scratching down there 

429.17 430.25 B: yeah 

431.72 437.38 B: right and they're such a huge uh i mean kids really look up to baseball players 

432.43 433.27 A: i mean 

436.96 444.51 A: [noise] mhm oh and then between them and the coaches when the cameras zero in on 'em do you ever watch what their mouths are saying 

440.02 441.02 B: mhm 

442.04 442.99 B: right 

443.81 446.45 B: [laughter] no 

446.47 447.48 A: (( [laughter] )) 

447.72 451.37 A: take a look sometime especially our football coach gil cower 

447.81 448.76 B: uh 

451.02 452.26 B: oh really 

451.79 454.43 A: oh he's got one of the foulest mouths going 

454.07 455.44 B: oh my god 

454.61 456.12 A: you oughta hear him 

455.90 456.64 B: (( ugh )) 

456.72 458.57 B: yeah that's too bad 

458.94 462.87 B: yeah did you ever see that movie any given sunday about football 

462.46 463.50 A: (( um no )) 

463.16 468.73 B: oh that was that was actually really excellent i- it gave a really good view of what it's like on the football field 

468.61 469.46 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

468.78 470.91 B: well i mean so i think 

470.34 470.98 A: (( mhm )) 

471.22 472.07 B: but 

471.35 473.84 A: oh no i missed that 

473.10 480.93 B: yeah yeah it's really realistic it seems and it's like the camera's right down on the field with them it's pretty amazing actually 

481.15 482.13 B: (( but [noise] )) 

481.68 488.44 A: i'm sure it is but i mean i i know going to the to the game and watching it on t._v. are two different things 

487.80 489.90 B: absolutely yeah 

488.93 491.57 A: i've been to one football game in my life 

491.06 491.95 B: really 

491.65 499.21 A: and i didn't like it being there in person and i didn't like it on t._v. base- baseball i at least understand what's going on 

495.39 496.95 B: yeah yeah 

498.78 500.18 B: yeah yeah 

499.43 504.72 A: i can go there and sit there and watch it for a little bit but it's just so long drawn out and boring 

501.89 503.03 B: right 

504.45 505.56 B: yeah 

505.07 506.61 A: i just don't see what the 

506.79 508.13 A: big thrill is 

507.72 509.25 B: yeah yeah 

508.44 514.90 A: hockey i can watch it on t._v. and i can go in person there's always something going on and the whole crowd gets involved 

511.55 512.80 B: oh that's good 

514.38 516.21 B: right right 

515.23 520.83 A: i mean maybe not like the football where the people that go half naked and paint their bodies the colors 

519.61 521.91 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

521.16 523.29 A: but you know they get into it 

522.99 535.72 B: yeah that's how at the baltimore orioles that was a pretty fun game to go to because people really did get into it but you had to be careful because it was really filled with a lot of drunk you know men falling down the stairs and 

526.45 527.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

532.56 534.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

535.38 542.78 A: well see that's another thing why do people have to get so drunk when they go to a game why can't you sit there and enjoy it why do you have to have alcohol 

536.63 537.53 B: yeah 

539.48 540.48 B: right 

542.44 543.99 B: right i agree 

543.18 550.18 A: because i mean annoy everybody around them start trouble there's fights scream obscenities at the players 

547.63 548.45 B: yeah 

550.08 553.37 B: yeah they probably shouldn't sell alcohol at those kinds of events 

553.81 557.18 B: i don't know i mean maybe not 'cause some are responsible 

556.56 563.60 A: [noise] no i i feel bad though for some of the players that just have nothing nice ever said to them or about them 

557.48 558.38 B: but 

562.89 564.52 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

563.96 568.75 A: and then you got your other players that are star players that don't hold their weight up 

568.15 570.50 B: right right [noise] 

569.87 571.40 A: you know like 

571.57 577.19 A: moriel emu he must have been i mean he was he was a hell of a player in his day but his time has come 

575.49 576.41 B: mhm 

576.94 577.93 B: right 

577.21 586.02 A: it's time to retire and stay on the side you know he keeps coming back out and he gets everybody all hyped up they lose and he is not pulling his weight 

580.43 581.87 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

585.71 587.48 B: right right [lipsmack] 

586.45 590.33 A: and then every time you turn around he's getting hurt and he's on the sidelines 

589.83 592.01 B: (( yeah uh [lipsmack] [mn] )) 

590.84 595.53 A: i mean he w- he was an excellent player in his day but his time has come it's over 

595.22 596.22 B: yeah 

595.56 597.26 A: let the new one on [noise] 

596.52 599.95 B: [laughter] yeah i agree i know what you're saying
