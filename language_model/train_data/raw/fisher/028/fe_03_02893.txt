115.55 116.56 A: (( uh-uh )) 

116.00 120.29 B: [laughter] so [laughter] but 

116.99 119.17 A: so [laughter] 

120.31 131.52 B: that doesn't help [laughter] that doesn't help it it it doesn't make it any more interesting for me i uh i've ay i i i tend to look at it as an inconvenience 

121.82 123.13 A: [laughter] 

131.70 134.71 B: um granted i'd probably 

135.25 140.77 B: i'd probably choose something yeah something like as opposed to uh 

140.54 151.98 B: watching an infomercial or something of that nature but [laughter] so but my my normal reaction to any kind of a t._v. sport would be uh 

143.51 146.86 A: mhm oh well i hope so [sigh] the 

151.78 159.95 B: switch the channel [laughter] switch the channel no matter what it is no matter what it is i would probably switch to it um

155.14 156.16 A: did you 

160.01 174.47 B: you know if if you were to get and i'm sure that they they want us to to stretch this if at possible and stuff to find something like that uh you know if one considers uh uh dog shows

177.00 178.48 A: mhm yeah

182.87 187.51 B: so but uh um but you know our our 

183.04 184.55 A: it's amazing 

188.02 197.36 B: you know [laughter] my wife just said or a horse race [sigh] [laughter] that would be that would be an extreme stretch for me [laughter] 

190.90 192.46 A: (( or a horse race )) 

192.57 194.40 A: [laughter] is that 

196.50 198.53 A: (( but that is a a sport )) 

197.63 204.14 B: i mean i like i like the horse i well let's see let's see i might watch a dressage competition 

203.86 205.66 A: (( a what competition )) 

204.16 215.35 B: yeah uh well that's that's uh that's that's a horsemanship competition [sigh] um like the lipizaneur stallions or something like that you know where they the the fa- 

209.70 211.59 A: oh okay all right 

215.32 223.82 B: the fancy patterns and uh you know the you know moving the horses around in a uh in a uh 

223.95 230.30 B: complex pattern on a [laughter] in in the arena i don't know so mhm 

228.59 231.42 A: no i understand well how about polo 

231.29 232.72 B: (( ah no )) 

231.69 233.94 A: since you seem to go for horses 

233.16 238.81 B: no no that's not [laughter] that wouldn't do it 

235.54 237.20 A: wouldn't like that either 

237.54 241.32 A: oh my goodness did you ever play sports when you were small 

241.12 242.63 B: how's that 

242.02 246.21 A: did you play sports any kind of a sport when you were no 

243.75 244.79 B: never 

245.63 253.92 B: never never um you know did no no i just i just never had any interest whatsoever 

246.92 250.28 A: i was going to say maybe you got hurt and you didn't like it 

253.78 255.21 A: isn't that something 

254.05 259.61 B: uh you know it dr- it drove my uh gym teachers up the wall because of course uh 

259.69 270.24 B: uh thirty plus years ago uh that was the purpose of gym class was to uh train the kids for the various sports teams [laughter] 

268.51 275.57 A: oh it was i didn't even think of that because i'm i'm much older than you are i can tell by your conversation 

270.94 271.85 B: [laughter] 

273.02 275.00 B: [laughter] 

275.57 288.01 B: so but uh but there was uh uh i just just never developed any interest whatsoever and my parents were very supportive of that because they really couldn't have cared less either [sigh] um 

275.66 276.99 A: but um 

286.99 295.89 A: well that's that's a good thing because my son um my my son's father and i were divorced when he was about five 

288.29 290.38 B: so [laughter] 

295.90 299.11 A: and of course his father was a gung ho sportsman 

298.48 299.87 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

299.23 304.95 A: and i used to shake every time i went to a football game that he played in 

305.66 309.18 A: and he played baseball and all kinds of sports 

309.26 319.58 A: but uh it was nerve wracking watching him play football and it's strange enough for me but when i was in high school we had uh 

319.66 328.07 A: one of the seniors who was not allowed to play sports all the years he was in school his mother wouldn't sign the papers 

327.49 328.89 B: mhm 

328.30 330.41 A: and she did the last year 

330.73 333.96 A: and the very first game he played in he was killed 

333.57 334.78 B: mhm oh god 

334.40 335.77 A: isn't that weird 

335.01 337.71 B: [laughter] yeah 

335.93 338.00 A: that i could like football 

338.11 342.53 B: that that that i i can see why that would scare anybody away from it [laughter] 

341.42 351.21 A: yeah and and with my own son it did but i still enjoy watching it it's weird i don't know why that is i'm going to have to look into that one [laughter] 

346.37 347.58 B: mhm 

350.21 351.87 B: yeah there you go 

351.68 353.83 A: does your wife like sports 

353.21 356.02 B: uh not that much 

356.18 357.39 B: uh 

358.15 369.59 B: you know she she'd she'd be likely to watch uh ice skating competitions for example well there's a there's a t._v. based sport there's a t._v. based sport 

369.37 371.18 A: uh-huh mhm 

370.00 373.51 B: uh i watch ice dancing 

373.31 376.70 A: yeah i i enjoy that's a sport yes 

374.26 376.52 B: uh what what'd you say 

376.94 386.74 B: my daughter's squeaking the olympics the olympics so well that that's that's where that's the only place where you ever see real ice dancing so uh how old is she 

383.40 384.96 A: how old is she 

386.06 387.06 A: your daughter 

386.76 389.24 B: oh uh early teenager 

389.24 391.19 A: oh okay [laughter] 

389.72 391.60 B: [laughter] so 

391.71 403.70 B: um but she and indeed she has seen me watch ice dancing and stuff but i tend to look at it from the con- from the uh critical critical eye of a dancer who's observing them on ice 

404.14 417.56 B: so now when now when the olympics finally one starts recognizing it and two actually airs it for uh ballroom dancing then i'll probably watch television sports 

404.28 405.42 A: okay 

417.56 420.31 A: oh right okay there you go [laughter] 

417.76 428.85 B: [laughter] yeah but they have to actually do that now i do know that a coupla years ago uh brian williamson's uh um 

428.93 435.62 B: c._n._b._c. actually did uh produce several uh dance competition 

436.42 438.65 B: programs uh 

438.93 448.59 B: but i haven't seen those since oh i don't know how long it's been at least two years since i've seen one of those that you know were actually aired on 

448.93 450.83 B: [sigh] mainstream television 

450.35 451.69 A: mhm mhm 

451.61 458.40 B: so uh that they they tried to promote it as a sport form as opposed to uh 

458.19 466.80 B: as an art from the the the t._v. coverage of ballroom dancing tends to be covered as an art form when you see it on p._b._s. or something but uh 

466.35 471.94 A: yeah i would say it falls into the art category myself because it is 

467.41 468.16 B: so 

470.22 473.42 B: mhm [laughter] so 

472.02 474.51 A: it really is it is an art 

474.15 485.89 B: now now have having having having had some experience there i can say that i can consider it a sport [laughter] it certainly is as demanding as sp- as sport but uh 

481.80 482.83 A: you do 

486.08 487.18 B: um 

487.54 499.43 B: like you're not going to get a whole load of re- uh uh agreement with me on that when it comes to t._v. producers [laughter] they're they're not going to [sigh] they're not going to listen to me and say oh yeah he knows what he's talking about let's put our money in that [laughter] 

492.85 493.88 A: oh 

499.10 504.23 A: well there are certain sports that i really believe shouldn't even be on t._v. 

499.58 500.23 B: so 

503.92 505.59 B: [laughter] 

504.34 507.40 A: i think it's too violent and that's wrestling 

507.05 508.41 B: mhm 

507.81 514.06 A: and then they also have that the ladies' mud wrestling and the ladies' wrestling and it 

513.45 517.74 B: mm i don't know what stations you're watching [laughter] 

516.26 520.52 A: oh you maybe don't have them in florida [laughter] i mean in penn- 

518.07 527.44 B: [sigh] ah well the the the wrestling you can't escape from on any channel i guess but uh i have yet to see televised ladies' mud wrestling 

523.04 523.98 A: yeah 

526.65 527.80 A: oh yes 

527.23 533.92 B: [sigh] [laughter] and that's in florida [laughter] okay 

527.97 530.34 A: oh yes it's horrible 

530.75 535.85 A: it yeah yeah i would think it would be all over 

535.29 539.73 B: mm well [laughter] i don't know i don't know 

536.57 541.03 A: not just florida that has it unless we have many more channels than you do 

540.46 546.37 B: [laughter] uh this this must this must be a cable system that's carrying it [laughter] 

541.16 542.69 A: (( but it's a horror )) 

545.47 549.70 A: i would never let my children you know watch something like that 

548.54 549.85 B: [laughter] 

550.10 553.40 A: you know it's just i don't know it's degrading to me 

550.42 551.66 B: that's bizarre 

554.41 564.20 A: and you would think that you know going back to football again i don't know why i do that but uh somehow or other when they mention sports i said oh that's a good topic 

563.83 564.47 B: (( mm )) 

564.35 568.05 A: and you're saying ooh [laughter] 

564.67 565.47 B: [laughter] 

566.22 578.69 B: well i'll tell ya i've been su- i i'm surprised this is the third call that i have gotten uh in the study and i was very surprised that this was the topic because the last two 

571.88 573.21 A: oh really 

578.67 586.15 B: calls have been um definitely current political tension type of 

586.28 587.90 B: uh topics 

587.69 588.69 A: oh 

587.99 592.13 B: and so i was ac- actually a little surprised 

592.27 594.60 B: because the the 

594.94 599.89 B: i had gotten the feel that it it was a study to be able to detect uh
