213.62 214.73 A: (( yeah )) 

214.93 215.95 B: so 

216.08 222.33 B: but no last time i actually sat down and watched anything and i don't even know if it counts as a sport is like 

222.36 224.34 B: the four wheeler races 

224.85 225.81 A: oh 

225.95 228.66 A: that's interesting i haven't ever seen those here 

228.46 234.43 B: oh well they oh i'm trying i don't even know what channel i think e._s._p._n. two does it 

234.32 237.44 A: yeah i like if i had to sit down 

237.51 242.38 A: i kinda like gymnastics or the the cheerleader 

242.43 243.51 A: finals 

243.52 245.08 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

245.09 247.81 A: um i like figure skating 

248.67 249.79 A: you know one 

249.98 254.21 A: not not well like especially if it's with partners and it's competition 

253.94 255.23 B: yeah 

254.80 264.13 A: [cough] i do enjoy that [lipsmack] um when the olympics are on um tend to watch um probably more of the same thing gymnastics and skating 

265.07 271.01 A: [sigh] but that's about my extent of sports on t._v. so how many hours will you watch 

271.04 273.29 A: a week depends upon 

273.68 275.50 A: what's on that we like 

275.58 283.90 B: [sigh] [noise] let me see i don't think we watch hard- i i w- yeah we don't really watch sports on a weekly basis 

283.93 289.50 B: but we're starting to get into um the world tough man competitions 

289.38 290.42 A: yeah 

289.74 296.75 B: because my brother in law will probably i'd give him another two three years and he'll probably be in 'em 

296.95 310.86 B: 'cause he broke he's uh he's a huge kid and uh he just went to national weightlifting competition and he broke like the national record for dead lift and bench pressing and 

310.27 313.87 A: oh my has he been doing that a long time 

311.19 312.58 B: the kid's huge 

313.93 321.43 B: um i believe he's a sophomore in college and he started his senior year of high school so about three years 

319.78 324.72 A: oh that's he's really good then he's probably natural at it considering you know 

324.41 326.03 B: yeah 

326.06 330.70 B: but the heck of it is the kids going to school to be an orthodontist [laughter] 

329.61 330.33 A: [laughter] 

330.87 333.18 A: he's going to be an orthodontist 

332.34 333.73 B: yeah 

333.31 342.78 A: yeah well i'm a dental assistant so i know that those guys kinda are a little bit they do kinda strange things it's got nothing to do with teeth 

340.27 341.52 B: [sigh] [sigh] well 

342.36 343.20 B: (( [laughter] )) 

343.54 351.58 B: well like someone said if they're gonna have a dentist they'd rather have a big strong guy who could pull the tooth out in one quick yank but [laughter] 

350.40 352.17 A: yeah well that's true 

352.28 355.56 A: you don't want a tooth pulled that way though out trust me 

355.21 356.91 B: yeah 

356.24 357.18 A: [mn] 

357.24 358.10 B: but 

358.55 359.65 B: no the 

360.34 364.73 B: we don't we don't watch t._v. honestly that much 

363.88 370.51 A: no well i don't i don't either i work a lot of evenings so i don't hardly ever watch t._v. in at night 

370.97 380.76 B: well i have i have a four month old baby and you know i just i think it over stimulates her to leave the t._v. on all day so 

380.09 383.21 A: well that might be true there might be something to say for that 

383.25 386.26 A: never heard it put that way before but that makes sense 

385.99 394.43 B: well it just seems like she's constantly i mean she loves watching t._v. and in the evenings you know we do watch t._v. but during the day 

394.56 398.18 B: it just seems likes she won't nap if i leave the t._v. on 

398.56 399.43 A: hm 

398.83 399.81 B: so 

399.96 402.65 A: so like you said she's probably over stimulated 

402.36 403.55 B: yeah 

403.75 404.38 B: (( [sigh] )) 

404.65 405.60 B: but

462.36 465.51 B: i think it was the day after i registered that they called here 

464.96 471.82 A: yeah and then um they called the next day when i was at work and then they called the next day 

472.62 476.77 A: and i was at work again so they did call back a third time

501.04 502.85 A: that's weird 

502.27 509.83 B: yeah i don't know i'm just like i was wary about this because i was like i didn't know if we were actually gonna get paid for it 

509.63 511.61 A: yeah i don't know i'm wondering 

510.25 518.30 B: 'cause i do a lotta mystery shopping and some people were like well i did it and never i've never gotten paid i got paid already for my first phone call so 

518.45 519.66 A: from this
