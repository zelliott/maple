116.96 117.94 A: no 

117.78 118.63 B: not 

118.64 120.83 B: never played any of these kinds of games [laughter] 

120.61 121.57 A: (( [laughter] [mn] [sigh] this )) 

126.15 129.30 A: is hard to stay on that topic [laughter] 

127.87 129.49 B: (( yeah i know [laughter] )) 

129.41 132.28 A: (( [laughter] just trying to think )) 

132.96 134.56 A: (( [laughter] oh no )) 

134.54 140.15 B: yeah see for me i just feel that there's there's so much coverage and you know so 

140.02 141.22 A: mhm 

140.39 142.69 B: so so many people like [laughter] 

142.78 145.87 B: whereas this professional sports thing but 

146.04 150.46 B: i never really [cough] really knew what they were about or that [laughter] it's just 

150.42 154.78 A: [sigh] it was so hard to avoid it at my college and i guess that's one of the reasons why 

155.00 156.68 A: i always watched 

156.71 158.40 A: the college football 

158.68 159.97 B: (( oh right )) 

158.91 159.62 A: (( in )) 

160.09 162.84 A: the weekends that's what everyone does so 

162.68 164.23 B: oh wow [laughter] 

163.06 165.91 A: (( it's kinda it was kind of i )) 

165.95 167.95 A: (( don't know the thing to do )) 

168.66 169.68 A: but um 

170.91 179.62 B: yeah i i very rarely even had a t._v. at home so [laughter] i 'cause i never really got that much chance either to watch these things 

174.08 175.47 A: [laughter] 

179.31 180.32 A: [laughter] 

184.58 195.03 A: [mn] is this your first phone call doing this or me too [laughter] my god why does it have to be about sports [laughter] [laughter] but 

186.90 189.47 B: yeah [laughter] 

191.42 193.33 B: (( yeah i know [laughter] )) 

194.46 197.28 B: (( at least well i guess if if if um if you um )) 

197.30 202.27 B: were with someone who knew a lot about it [laughter] i guess you could probably talk a lot about them 

203.03 204.32 A: i i yeah 

203.08 205.81 B: but i can't really contribute much [laughter] 

204.97 206.05 A: [laughter] 

207.21 209.06 A: oh no i 

210.22 212.36 B: mm [laughter] [laughter] 

211.21 212.40 A: [laughter] 

215.90 218.25 A: [mn] [sigh] trying to think [laughter] 

218.80 220.40 B: yeah what is it that um 

220.51 224.82 B: that draws you to the to these sports as a fan i guess 

224.24 227.79 A: um well with my father growing up 

227.86 233.57 A: here we've had the games on in the weekends and he was a big um new york giants fan 

233.88 237.73 A: and so i would just sit down and watch it with him 

237.80 241.70 A: and it was kind of like father daughter type thing 

241.52 243.98 B: oh oh like father daughter bonding [laughter] 

241.86 243.00 A: so i think 

243.38 249.66 A: yeah so i think i enjoyed it for that aspect and then i just got into it [mn] and then um 

250.15 255.98 A: i don't know i find that knowing a little about [sigh] sports just 

256.26 267.29 A: even helps me in the workplace i mean there's always something to talk about or you know hey did you see that game yesterday or did you see what so and so did and so on like a social level 

267.62 268.74 A: it's um 

270.51 272.66 A: i just feel like for me it's 

272.78 275.49 A: good to be up on what's going on just [mn] 

276.68 283.33 A: f- 'cause ever- you know you come in on monday and everyone's talking about the game and this way you can participate in the conversation 

283.08 285.32 B: (( [sigh] yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

283.78 285.38 A: but [laughter] 

286.03 287.13 A: but um 

288.27 297.21 A: [mn] so i think maybe for me it's more of like a social thing than actually liking football and liking liking basketball but 

294.10 295.08 B: (( oh )) 

297.52 300.42 A: [lipsmack] and i tend to have more 

300.55 303.33 A: male friends than female friends so 

303.60 310.90 A: from having out with them they'll always have the game on and i don't really have a choice but i have to watch it so [laughter] so i 

307.85 309.25 B: [laughter] oh yeah 

311.26 315.44 A: don't know is there a reason why you don't watch it too much or 

314.75 321.88 B: i guess i never really got exposed to it and like i really don't have that much of a chance i guess i would really have to go out of my way to 

321.86 334.87 B: to go and watch it you know besides i don't i don't have a t._v. at home and like i i have lived with roommates who did have t._v.s and like every once in a while but for most of my life i never had access to a t._v. at home [laughter] 

323.14 324.20 A: uh-huh 

326.54 327.65 A: okay 

334.56 335.93 A: (( mhm )) 

335.16 336.13 B: (( [laughter] so )) 

336.63 342.86 B: yes it that didn't really and then i guess i never was really around people who were big fans of 

342.58 343.65 A: (( mhm )) 

342.91 346.34 B: (( so mostly just sort of a lack of opportunity and )) 

346.08 347.04 A: (( mhm )) 

346.58 348.37 B: and then i guess i never really 

348.45 353.07 B: learned that much about it and so i never really developed any interest in it so i don't know 

352.70 353.73 A: (( mhm )) 

354.35 358.11 A: [sigh] yeah i guess i can see how if you're not exposed to it then 

358.38 359.39 A: i mean 

360.73 369.19 A: [sigh] not i 'cause really the only reason that i've gotten into it is 'cause i've been exposed to it so much and through my friends and family 

369.51 370.31 A: so 

371.57 372.59 A: (( [mn] i don't know )) 

377.91 387.29 A: but i was never really like athletic [laughter] or anything so it wasn't because of that [sigh] but [laughter] maybe i like watching it better than playing [laughter] 

381.97 383.59 B: oh [laughter] 

387.49 389.99 B: yeah i never was athletic at all [laughter] mm 

389.40 390.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

399.98 403.25 A: [sigh] [mn] y- do you know like where are you from 

403.79 405.37 B: (( where am i from oh ))

426.38 427.83 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

433.94 437.52 A: and then you just like if you're in california for
