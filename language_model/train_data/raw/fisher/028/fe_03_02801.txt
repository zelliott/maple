0.97 2.25 B: hello 

1.73 2.91 A: (( hi )) 

2.53 4.37 B: hello i'm charles how you doing 

3.89 5.62 A: i'm fine i'm hailey 

5.26 6.68 B: hi [laughter] 

5.86 9.60 A: how are you what ah sports do you enjoy to watch on t._v. 

9.42 12.12 B: (( ump really none )) 

11.91 12.72 A: (( oh )) 

12.17 14.29 B: i'm not a sports person 

13.72 16.97 A: oh i see we watch a lot of nascar 

16.94 18.38 B: (( oh i )) 

16.98 21.07 A: and so my husband really enjoys that he likes to watch racing 

21.12 26.28 B: never i never understood nascar i mean all they're doing is going around a track 

23.53 24.47 A: no 

25.38 34.43 A: [laughter] you know until you start getting into it and like get to know like who drives each car and stuff it does just look like it would be really boring 

34.01 34.92 B: uh-huh 

34.51 43.44 A: but once you kind of get into you know who's driving what car and who their sponsor is and the background of the drivers then it's a lot more interesting you 

42.52 45.36 B: look it's not the speed or anything you're looking at 

45.49 50.58 A: know um yeah i mean it's pretty interesting the speed and then you know it's exciting when they crash 

50.26 54.44 B: [laughter] 

51.53 54.61 A: [laughter] that bad but i mean 

54.87 57.71 A: (( it is kinda like you know they're )) 

57.85 63.52 A: they're going so fast it's interesting you know [noise] you know when just when they stuff it 

62.75 65.64 B: because how do you determine who goes first 

65.44 77.30 A: um they do a qualifying like if they have a race on sunday then the friday before they'll do qualifying where they pick a number [noise] basically out of a hat and and they do um one lap 

77.06 77.94 B: uh-huh 

78.14 83.43 A: one lap and it's like the fastest speed that's the order that's how they start 

80.37 81.25 B: uh-huh 

83.61 94.93 A: and then stay start it's just amazing how much it can change around like you know you could start at the front and then be at the back and be lapped down and then make your laps back and stuff 

83.66 85.28 B: (( yeah )) 

95.19 99.94 B: so how do you know who who's the big wiper at the end of the year and then 

99.69 107.62 A: well for every race when they win or wherever they place they get points and so there's a points race and so each 

104.43 105.41 B: okay 

106.72 109.50 B: each kind of race has a different point or something 

109.80 120.42 A: like wherever you finish like the winner might get a certain amount of points then second place will get like five points less and third place well get less again and 

119.51 120.96 B: oh 

120.48 131.89 A: if you lead laps you get extra points and the person who leads the most laps gets extra points so basically by the points each race and you know you see where you're at 

126.50 127.45 B: oh 

132.46 134.11 B: so you're 

132.57 137.00 A: and you're winning a lot of money you know there's a lot of money involved with it [laughter] 

135.94 140.20 B: but you don't actually have to win to be leading is that what you're saying 

139.45 147.89 A: just be leading the points no you just have to be pretty fast and always finish the race and you know be up in the top ten or so and 

140.75 141.73 B: yeah 

147.38 148.56 B: oh okay 

147.82 157.93 A: yeah just consistency more than anything 'cause sometimes you know they blow engines and stuff and they dont get to finish the race and that puts them in last place and then they lose a lot of points 

153.23 154.18 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

158.09 159.83 B: you lose points 

159.79 161.59 A: well i 

161.44 163.19 B: or you just don't gain 

162.69 168.59 A: yeah you don't gain any and everybody else goes ahead so yeah you don't lose points i didn't mean that sorry 

168.56 169.62 B: (( any )) 

168.64 169.39 A: (( it anything )) 

174.21 175.93 B: (( more like )) 

176.06 177.06 B: (( in )) 

177.54 178.74 A: (( like um um golf where they )) 

178.69 183.25 B: the masters if you win or in the top ten you get to play 

180.16 180.93 A: (( rank you )) 

181.62 183.66 A: (( at certain um tournaments [noise] )) 

183.27 185.03 B: for so many years 

184.45 192.68 A: [noise] no anybody gets to any race that there is everybody gets to um try to compete [noise] and you have to qualify 

192.56 203.73 A: um the the first i think like thirty eight spots are by times and then there's like five spots at the end where they can use provisionals like if a 

199.69 200.58 B: uh-huh 

203.03 204.39 B: what's a provisional 

203.84 206.23 A: a a driver [sigh] um 

206.30 211.43 A: they're just basically like free passes sort of thing to like get into the race like 

211.48 219.00 A: if a if a past champion might had might have a provisional for that or you're the owner of your car might have several 

218.87 230.44 A: provisionals and so there's a certain amount of like free passes you can use to get into the race and then once they're all used up you gotta make sure that you are you know fast enough to qualify 

228.91 229.69 B: but 

230.22 232.09 B: but you get more passes later 

231.84 233.01 A: mhm 

232.92 234.72 B: (( oh okay )) 

233.68 234.78 A: (( yeah )) 

234.85 239.41 A: so that's what we like to watch a lot it is kind of funny 'cause then i guess it's been 

236.02 236.90 B: [noise] 

239.71 249.76 A: about six years ago that i really got into it and the main reason why is they built a race track here in texas and we started going to the race in person 

249.44 250.30 B: uh-huh 

249.74 256.54 A: and the atmosphere is just kinda neat out there and everybody camps out and there's just kind of fun watching them go that fast 

256.27 260.53 B: oh fun watching them going fast [laughter] 

258.46 265.14 A: yeah but it's just kinda that's how we originally kinda got into it and then we just watched it a whole lot 

264.84 267.16 B: is he a a football fan too 

267.11 275.48 A: um my husband likes football quite a lot and because nascar is such a long season they don't have like three months off it goes like 

274.59 275.77 B: oh 

275.58 289.89 A: through october and november and then starts back up in february there's not a huge amount of time in between they kind of overlap so he'll watch a little bit of football in between but mostly he just watches the nascar thank goodness cause 

289.93 292.36 A: i don't need him watching too many sports and being 

292.39 293.82 A: (( t._v. all the time yeah )) 

293.49 295.83 B: oh i didn't know it overlapped 

295.31 300.19 A: yeah it's it's a long season and drivers don't get much time off 

300.60 309.98 B: oh much time off i like how you said that [laughter] [mn] so do do you go to a lot of the races or do you watch them on television 

303.41 304.84 A: [laughter] 

309.01 321.21 A: um just watch a lot on television we go to the one here in texas and we've been to the one in california and my husband's been to the one up in kansas city but you know they're all over the place you know 

320.99 324.88 A: each week there's florida or you know just 

324.98 327.15 A: all over so 

326.33 327.18 B: uh-huh 

327.30 331.53 A: really expensive to go to a lot of them but he'd like to go see more of them 

329.31 330.36 B: oh 

331.45 335.01 B: not when you say expensive like what are tickets 

334.77 341.07 A: um you know some race tracks it's really hard to even get tickets because there's so many season ticket holders 

340.83 346.19 B: that's what i was about to ask do they are they are they like the other sports become tickets holders and 

345.52 349.33 A: yeah you can have season tickets or you can buy regular season tickets 

349.22 363.10 A: and we have season tickets out at texas because otherwise you've got to stand in line and it's you know it's kind of like a big hassle to get tickets or like it's hard to get a good seat there's so many people i mean the races are always just 

359.93 360.69 B: (( oh )) 

363.57 364.60 A: (( full )) 

364.08 366.34 B: so to go it's worth having 

366.25 367.39 A: yeah 

366.66 370.48 B: you like how about the children do they enjoy it i hear children in the background 

369.49 381.68 A: and [laughter] my three year old he went we took him to the qualifying round this year and he he likes it he gets all excited with his dad and watches it and and roots for his dad's driver that's gillmark 

374.64 375.52 B: uh-huh 

378.14 379.12 B: (( uh-huh )) 

381.91 391.16 A: and you know gets excited about the racing and we're like he'll watch and notice if there's a wreck or something so he likes that 

390.57 393.33 B: oh that is so sweet 

392.36 396.09 A: you know they just copy what their dad does [laughter] 

395.89 398.46 B: (( oh that's nice )) 

398.01 406.12 A: but yeah we've we watch a little bit of football and we don't ever really watch baseball ever since they striked out kind of lost interest 

406.09 407.85 B: (( yeah so ))

431.16 433.19 A: (( mm mhm )) 

432.63 435.75 B: 'cause you gotta show no favoritism 

435.37 436.49 A: yeah

437.35 439.41 A: yeah [laughter] 

438.60 440.78 B: so he's not a big sports fan 

440.57 441.61 A: (( no ))

444.52 445.81 A: oh really 

445.29 448.09 B: something we could never understand as children 

447.71 450.34 A: like the w._w._f. stuff that's 

449.01 452.03 B: yes yes [laughter] 

451.19 452.34 A: (( crazy )) 

451.98 466.67 B: we couldn't understand it as children and he would take us and we'd just be sitting there and he'd be you know beat this for person up come on and blood would be all over the place we're like why is daddy yelling [laughter] we could never 

459.23 460.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

463.24 467.84 A: [laughter] oh yeah wrestling is funny 

467.40 471.56 B: we could never get into it but that was his favorite sport

472.82 475.94 A: must be a guy aggressive thing or something 

475.60 488.91 B: yeah i think so anything with blood and guts they want to get into it [laughter] and i think i tend when i do go to a sport with them it's just for the entertainment of being with them 

478.78 482.29 A: [laughter] yeah 

488.26 491.03 A: watching them yeah how they react 

490.79 492.73 B: just social with them 

492.38 494.07 A: (( yeah definite )) 

494.33 496.75 B: that's a good thing i guess 

496.06 505.98 A: yeah that's that's the thing what is good about sporting events it brings you together as a group because you get an excuse to go involvement yeah 

503.87 509.99 B: as a family to do something we might not understand it but at least you know we're showing some kind of 

510.31 511.01 B: (( ah )) 

511.09 515.11 B: loyalty to them i guess [laughter] take us 

513.10 514.17 A: (( that's )) 

514.61 517.22 A: pretty much why i go to a football game or 

516.62 520.41 B: (( to tickets are so expensive and i like for what )) 

518.36 520.54 A: it is very expensive 

520.41 527.00 A: we're kinda lucky 'cause a few times my husband will get tickets from his work that they'll just give away you know for 

524.63 525.52 B: uh-huh 

526.86 539.32 A: we've been to hockey games and we have baseball tickets for this weekend in fact so i'll go and take my sons they're three and or almost three and one i don't 

529.34 530.28 B: uh-huh 

532.06 533.99 B: oh my gosh 

534.88 536.42 B: oh 

538.37 540.59 B: that's wonderful 

539.51 545.41 A: know how well they'll fit but you know if you get the tickets for free it doesn't really matter if you can't see the whole thing i guess 

544.79 550.68 B: oh that is wonderful i wish we could afford season tickets some place i really 

551.01 553.39 B: maybe i would understand the sport 

552.70 554.76 A: [laughter] 

554.14 559.82 B: i know they get paid enough they maybe they should teach classes to season holders 

555.60 557.24 A: (( yeah )) 

559.41 560.65 A: [laughter] yeah 

560.12 564.73 B: so they'll understand what's going on because you do pay enough for those tickets 

564.18 565.95 A: yeah you do 

565.65 568.81 B: and they do have short lived careers though 

568.60 570.18 A: yeah some of them 

570.30 572.54 A: you know different 

572.96 577.03 A: sports are you know there just dangerous to all the sports i guess 

577.03 578.42 B: yeah 

577.69 581.40 A: nascar has deaths or people getting hurt and then 

581.21 589.11 B: i know i'm sorta scared to watch those because when those wrecks happen it's most you know almost always fatal 

588.72 592.06 A: yeah well they it's amazing though how much 

592.16 599.89 A: protective gear and stuff that they have and they have new requirements so that their heads don't get jarred too much and like like head restraints
