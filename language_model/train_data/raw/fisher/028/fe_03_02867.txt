39.33 40.69 A: we just start talking [noise] 

40.26 50.06 B: okay [laughter] t._v. sports gosh um you know we we don't really have a favorite we watch a little bit of everything um just whatever the season is whatever's on 

49.94 55.39 B: um half the time we watch it for the ads usually the ads are are pretty strong and clever and creative 

55.37 69.90 B: during the sports um we like the falcons a lot here um so we we'll follow follow them wherever they go um we tend to go to a lot of the um the the clubs to watch games you know where they the sporting clubs bars that type of thing with friends 

58.23 59.45 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

68.94 71.31 A: oh like sports bars yeah 

70.06 80.29 B: yeah and um you know we follow the braves a little bit too um not so much if they're winning or losing just that they're on but we both like the commercials a lot just as just as much as watching the games 

79.86 81.03 A: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

80.64 89.40 B: so that's uh you know that's uh pretty much what we do [laughter] we actually have a relative who's a was a professional wrestler of all things years ago 

89.17 90.24 A: oh wow 

89.31 101.64 B: so yeah [laughter] had no interest in it prior to marriage but [laughter] anyway i mean he's he's been re- you know he's uh retired for fifteen years but you know that's all theatrical and you know wrestling's not real but anyway [laughter] but that's 

92.50 94.69 A: [laughter] 

100.80 102.14 A: yeah 

101.70 108.46 B: but um you know we watch a little bit of that more for amusement than anything else like how did this guy make a living doing this but but 

107.82 109.98 A: yeah i don't get into the wrestling 

109.13 112.92 B: no no no not at all us us either but um 

112.64 113.68 A: (( no [mn] )) 

113.10 122.33 B: but but the uh the falcons and the braves you know we will follow them and tend not to go you know to the games we'd rather watch it on television than to deal with 

122.22 136.49 B: the chaos and the driving and you know too many people in a confined area we're not really into that we'd rather just watch it on t._v. and go with another two or three or four couples and that way everybody can leave when they want to and you know enjoy it at the same time 

135.94 140.58 A: yeah well here is sports are on all the time 

141.09 146.29 A: uh so if my husband's not watching 'em my son's watching 'em and now with the basketball playoffs going on 

145.67 147.02 B: oh yeah 

146.33 161.16 A: the t._v. is always on sports i was actually lucky to get saturday off from 'em but um i actually do enjoy watching them but i can't during the playoffs i can't watch anything else because i got to fight them for the t._v. 

158.63 163.57 B: right [laughter] no no choice right [laughter] [laughter] 

161.50 174.44 A: no there is no choice either there's a mariners baseball game on or you know the playoffs so you know i mean it is cool but it's like but sometimes i want to watch something else but the playoffs you know they'll be over soon so 

174.28 180.47 A: it'll be back to just baseball and then football will start so sports are year round here 

180.26 192.35 A: but it's basketball baseball and football and and my husband will watch like boxing and he tries to watch wrestling but if i'm home i actually say please can we watch something else you know 

190.64 193.08 B: [noise] [laughter] right right 

192.45 199.36 A: but as far as favorite teams go there's oh my god there's too many i like the sonics well you know 'cause i'm by seattle 

198.92 200.02 B: right 

199.56 213.75 A: and we like the mariners and stuff but we also like the trailblazers who just got booted out of the playoffs yeah so now it's like okay i like the lakers but my husband doesn't 'cause he's tired of them winning but um 

205.43 207.09 B: oh that's right that's right 

214.44 217.18 A: let's see uh i'm not into hockey 

217.44 228.25 A: but so nobody really wa- nobody really watches that here but jeeze uh favorite i guess would just have to be my home town you know or my home state 

226.37 227.52 B: (( right [noise] )) 

228.22 239.14 A: i mean they do really well you know the mariners and the sonics seahawks football team is a different story but i do like watching the raiders and i like you know 

232.12 233.43 B: right 

233.65 234.59 B: [laughter] 

239.40 244.15 A: the cowboys you know stuff like that but it's basketball seems to be 

244.52 251.65 A: the more popular one and i don't know if it's because they have you know a lot of games or or what it is but 

251.49 253.66 B: do you go to a lot of the games or 

252.92 258.84 A: [mn] um no my son has gone he goes to the professional games he goes in seattle 

258.76 259.75 B: okay 

258.93 262.33 A: and i've always told i've always said i want to go 

262.39 266.42 A: you know at least once i want to go go see a professional game 

266.55 267.55 B: right 

266.59 278.65 A: and i mean seattle's only like an hour and a half away so it's not like it's you know a a long drive it's just a matter of thinking ahead of time let's get the tickets you know 

271.51 272.59 B: (( right [noise] )) 

278.31 279.49 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

278.74 287.91 A: but he he's done that way in advance buys them online and then goes with his friends and stuff and it's like oh i never thought about myself you know 

286.78 291.68 B: so when you when you watch t._v. is a pretty much a a family affair or come and go or 

291.09 299.78 A: it is uh everybody works like different different um hours usually and stuff so you know the 

300.19 305.59 A: when my husband gets home in the evening he's going to look for the the playoff games you know 

304.93 306.31 B: right right 

305.67 313.03 A: um my son goes to work at six p._m. so he tries to watch what he can before that but then come the weekend 

312.81 323.63 A: he's got the weekend off now he'll actually go to a sports bar you know 'cause he's he's twenty one and then he'll watch games with friends sometimes and stuff but um 

318.27 319.58 B: right 

323.73 328.55 A: it's it varies it it's always on lately something is 

327.75 330.11 B: do you ever um tape any of it or 

330.14 336.31 A: um i've taped games for my son before when there was a good game going on and he's like 

336.35 340.34 A: he'll find out the score anyway but he wants to actually watch the game 

340.28 353.05 A: and he knows he's going to miss it all so i've done that just a couple times though you know 'cause he'll it doesn't matter if they watch a game anyway they're going still turn to e._s._p._n. and watch all the highlights 

345.62 346.62 B: right 

352.60 353.91 B: right right 

353.01 359.86 A: of the game that they just watched [laughter] and then all the any other game that was on a different channel you know so i don't know 

358.03 359.42 B: right 

359.61 364.55 B: well sometimes we'll tape it and we have a thirteen year old and he he's just starting to get into sport so 

364.39 374.98 B: he'll want to watch it with his friends and of course they don't have the patience to watch the whole game so they'll fast forward to what they think is important and he'll laugh about it and want a pizza and you know tr- try to earn 

364.48 365.60 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

372.54 378.08 A: [noise] [noise] yeah there you go yeah want you to get rid of the commercials too [laughter] 

375.40 383.02 B: [laughter] right right try to earn the pizza for the day you know gosh you know we did we did the yard we watched the game this is fun now can we go out and play 

382.88 384.21 A: (( yeah no kidding )) 

383.25 398.02 B: so so so they'll do that and trade a tape around that seems to be pretty popular with the thirteen sixteen year olds in in our neighborhood anyway who who got the tape who recorded it gosh you forgot to no you got it so then it it becomes a little circle of an event or party whatever for them so 

393.80 395.64 A: yeah 

397.96 405.81 A: yeah my son's been into sport since he was uh able to walk he he played you know little league and all that fun stuff you know 

401.60 402.71 B: oh wow 

405.04 409.61 B: oh i wish we could get ours more involved he's he's kind of a computer brat so 

409.60 415.71 B: you know it's it's it's it's four hour you know four hours on the computer before doing something outside sports whatever 

409.90 411.35 A: (( [mn] ah )) 

415.66 430.11 B: but um he's trying to get into the the baseball thing a little bit but he um if he doesn't get picked right away then he's discouraged you know and he doesn't he wants to watch it on t._v. and he'll go gosh i wish i could be like that i'm like yeah it's it's all just practice and motivation 

424.61 425.78 A: yeah 

429.20 442.20 A: [noise] i think my son started playing uh i think he had to be in third grade or fourth grade um and then that here at least and then he got a start you know and then it carried into high into school you know 

441.79 443.44 B: right right 

442.34 449.40 A: but yeah it it's it is easier too as they get older if you know to just watch it you know 

449.27 461.45 B: [lipsmack] well i i mean it takes your mind off of everything else you know which is usually unless something's on the stove or whatever [laughter] you know but i mean in general it just kind of takes takes the mind off of um you know the stress of the day and work and all of that so 

449.85 450.75 A: so 

460.94 464.58 A: [noise] oh yeah i thought it was cool going to his games you know 

461.56 462.42 B: (( you know )) 

464.02 465.77 B: i bet that was fun yeah 

464.52 466.27 A: i was the biggest cheerleader 

465.80 467.40 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

466.12 475.92 A: um yeah it it it was interesting but yeah i mean he's older now you know so me and him are actually discuss the sports more than my husband does you know 

474.72 476.55 B: oh wow yeah 

475.76 486.19 A: because we kinda like the same teams and he can actually knows he can have a conversation with me about sports and i know who what he's talking about who he's talking about 

486.02 499.69 A: and stuff and you know i mean it's it's kind of cool because we he's actually been away before and called and we've been watching a game at the same time and talk about it you know so it's kind of cool um 

495.92 497.08 B: oh that's fun 

500.03 511.57 A: my husband is [mn] was never into 'em before but he swears he was and it's like it seems like it's just been in the last three years that he's just so gung ho and i go i don't recall you 

508.30 509.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

511.77 515.60 A: really being in this sport so i think that's why me and my son 

515.72 517.26 A: have that connection 

516.98 518.38 B: right right 

517.75 531.94 A: and stuff but i mean i know i could i could sit down and have a conversation about any sports and and with a guy and know who i'm talking about the team you know can't tell you everybody's stats or anything like that but 

530.28 532.24 B: [laughter] right 

532.16 543.56 A: i know who plays for what for who and and how good they are you know so i i i figured you know i'm pretty knowledgeable about it i'm no dummy when it comes to the sports 

536.19 537.70 B: (( right )) 

541.97 545.86 B: [laughter] so it's a con- conversation thing too that's fine 

545.04 550.05 A: yes i can i can have a conversation about it i guess is what i'm trying to say 

549.91 556.33 B: and do you find people at work talking about it you know you go to work the next day what game was on who won all that kind of stuff or 

556.15 565.15 A: um well i work from home on the internet so but when i was out there um it was mostly girls that i worked with anyway 

558.39 560.83 B: okay okay all right 

565.05 577.36 A: but yeah sometimes the guys would but they wouldn't like bring it up to to you because they wouldn't think that you knew anything about it and then you start saying well i caught that game last night and then it's like oh and then you impress 'em 

565.12 566.10 B: okay 

571.42 572.84 B: right right 

577.24 583.31 A: because you start talking about stuff it's like whoa oh my gosh she knows what she's talking about you know 

581.77 583.00 B: right 

583.09 596.46 A: but but there was more females and they're not going to sit around and discuss baseball you know or basketball or anything like that so um i suppose if i worked in a more male oriented environment 

585.51 586.69 B: (( right [noise] )) 

590.42 591.83 B: right 

596.21 597.44 B: right 

596.80 599.35 A: it would have been a whole di- a whole different story
