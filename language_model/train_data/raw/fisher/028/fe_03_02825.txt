23.41 24.92 B: yeah i think 

25.38 29.04 B: i think i've seen it on some cable but not hardly at all 

28.96 36.93 A: right um and gymnastics and some of the sports that don't get as much recognition i think get put on cable only 

36.79 37.93 B: right 

38.84 47.26 A: but i don't i'm not really that big of a fan of all the different sports except uh like when it gets to play off time it gets pretty exciting i live in los angeles 

47.34 51.20 A: and their basketball team has been on recently they're in the play offs oh 

50.81 56.63 B: right i live um near los angeles actually i live in santa clarita 

56.36 57.26 A: mhm 

57.26 62.36 B: um but i don't watch a lotta sports on t._v. um the only sports 

62.55 66.60 B: my husband and i really watch is like auto racing nascar stuff 

65.78 66.85 A: oh wow 

66.95 70.32 B: and that's it my husband doesn't like any other kind of sports so [laughter] 

70.02 75.61 A: huh does the auto racing that that's on some regular t._v. right sometimes if it's like a big event oh [lipsmack] 

70.42 70.98 B: (( [noise] )) 

75.41 76.63 B: um 

76.95 81.62 B: [lipsmack] yeah it's it's on every sunday basically but there's like a lot of 

82.58 90.70 B: [lipsmack] shows that have to do with it on cable but it's only on sundays and it's only on like march through october 

90.72 91.72 A: oh 

91.80 94.90 B: so and it's not even every sunday so 

95.84 98.43 A: so do you ever see gymnastics on t._v. 

99.18 101.94 B: you know i rarely see gymnastics 

101.23 108.87 A: mhm yeah i like that a lot they did have the uh i think it was the college nationals the other day on 

108.95 115.43 A: mm i don't know if it was n._b._c. or a._b._c. but it was on locally here and that was really really fun to watch 

115.62 118.17 A: i like that just because it's different you know oh 

115.78 117.07 B: yeah i haven't 

118.00 125.62 B: the the other thing uh i watch is a lot of ice skating because my daughter who's three loves ice skating 

125.14 135.03 A: yeah i like that too and it comes on every now and then you know some sometimes they'll have something on the regular um you know networks that's really fun to watch i like that 

126.59 129.24 B: [mn] so we watch that yeah 

134.60 139.08 B: right yeah my that's the only times that we usually 

140.34 145.27 B: watch it i don't watch a whole lotta sports just because i'm not into a lot of sports 

144.63 146.39 A: mhm [lipsmack] well i 

145.48 147.86 B: (( i don't have a lotta time [laughter] )) 

147.02 159.41 A: i yeah i know well what i find is a lot of the [lipsmack] the big cities get their sports on whereas the smaller city that doesn't have as much advertising dollars they don't get to have their teams on t._v. that often 

156.30 157.31 B: right 

159.30 160.53 B: right 

161.00 165.23 A: so i just you know that that part doesn't seem fair but i know it's all about the money 

165.05 168.57 B: yeah unfortunately that's what sports is all about 

168.02 175.19 A: mhm [laughter] yeah that's true but baseball when it's on it's so long you know it takes a long time to finish a game 

174.88 175.89 B: right 

176.08 178.89 B: yeah i grew up where my father has watched 

179.30 181.74 B: every kind of sport imaginable 

181.43 186.16 A: yeah mine did too on t._v. all the time they were always watching it [laughter] 

183.73 190.99 B: yeah so it kind of like deterred me from enjoying watching any of it just because it it just got you know 

188.05 188.86 A: (( [laughter] )) 

191.61 194.05 B: a lit- to be a little bit too much 

193.42 198.98 A: right yeah my dad and my brother both were sports fanatics so the t._v. was always on the sports but 

198.96 209.16 A: i if i got a chance to ever get on there and have any say in the matter that's what i would like to watch is something different like the volleyball gymnastics even the beach volleyball or indoor it doesn't matter but 

208.81 210.07 B: (( [mn] right )) 

209.53 213.76 A: yeah i really like to to see that on t._v. and i wish it was on more often 

213.54 215.25 B: right yeah 

216.03 216.83 B: does 

216.04 217.43 A: do you have cable 

217.12 218.85 B: yeah we have cable 

219.06 225.03 B: i just just because i have little ones i don't we don't watch a whole lotta sports it's mostly kids' shows 

224.64 225.55 A: (( [mn] mhm mhm )) 

225.44 239.92 B: but they do enjoy watching my son'll watch like dirt bike riding and stuff like that and skate boarding he likes to watch that kind of stuff but he's only five so he hasn't really had a chance to get into a lot of the sports that are on t._v. 

230.18 231.36 A: oh yeah hm 

233.95 234.65 A: mhm 

240.06 247.42 B: every once in a while like we usually watch superbowl because we go to a friend's house to watch it not really into it but we'll watch it anyway 

244.80 245.88 A: oh yeah 

247.03 254.45 A: yeah that kind of turns into an event you know like a social gathering that everybody watches the the game but they're kinda having a good time too mhm 

249.07 250.04 B: yeah 

253.74 259.85 B: right and just like you know the world series last year was a big thing so we all watched that together and 

257.66 258.81 A: oh yeah 

259.15 261.90 A: yeah i watched some of that too that was good 

261.88 267.30 B: yeah so it just you know it i guess it just depends on 

267.33 269.20 B: what's on and when it's on 

268.96 269.94 A: mhm 

270.14 274.78 A: [lipsmack] yeah we'll we'll probably watch it my boyfriend and i we'll probably watch um 

270.22 271.33 B: but yeah 

275.24 279.58 A: the hockey play offs because the anaheim ducks are in the play offs 

279.05 282.08 B: right yeah my brother's really into that 

281.78 295.01 A: yeah it's fun it's fun to watch on t._v. but it seems like there's so much going on that you can't even keep up with it almost the puck is moving so quickly and you know the guys are all over the place and the camera can only get so much of an angle 

282.78 284.20 B: he'll watch that 

294.70 295.88 B: right 

295.74 300.32 A: but yeah it's kind of fun to watch it's kinda fun to watch him watching it if you know what i mean [laughter] 

299.62 300.98 B: oh yeah 

300.53 302.47 A: he gets pretty crazy 

302.78 308.30 A: but uh the basketball has been fun uh it's actually a very exciting team that they have here in los angeles 

308.80 316.96 B: yeah i haven't you know i'm not a big basketball fan but you know last year we watched we ended up watching a little bit of the play offs 

316.51 319.09 A: mhm yeah that was a great game 

317.17 320.45 B: not too much but a little bit yeah 

319.77 324.52 A: yeah i'm not that big of a fan either but it's just something about that team they are fun to watch 

324.17 329.42 B: oh yeah it gets you into it quite a bit get with all the excitement i guess 

326.35 327.97 A: mhm yeah 

328.92 343.51 A: exactly so i know in los angeles it's a big thing out here the beach volleyball but i guess still it doesn't really make it to the to the regular networks 'cause there's just not enough money in it you know as far as advertising dollars i guess that's what they're looking for mm 

339.73 340.97 B: yeah 

343.07 348.37 B: that's true i have a friend of mine who used to be really involved in the beach volleyball circuit 

347.68 348.71 A: mhm 

348.41 356.68 B: but uh he's not anymore but he still watches it he coaches his daughter and all kinds of stuff but he says it's not on very much either 

356.34 363.32 A: yeah i think it's on e._s._p._n. two or something it's not just the basic e._s. e._s._p._n. you have to get extra channels to get it 

363.03 364.08 B: right 

363.70 367.35 A: so i don't have that right now but maybe someday i'll get that 

366.73 368.82 B: yeah i you know i 

368.91 375.14 B: i'll watch sports every once in a while i'm not a big fan of 'em but if it's on and that's all that's 

375.18 378.05 B: on i'd probably watch it but 

376.66 379.59 A: yeah i like the olympics when that comes around you know 

378.92 380.25 B: oh yeah oh 

379.63 382.26 A: 'cause there's so many different sports to pick from 

381.90 388.50 B: exactly olympics we watch that in my house that's definite we always watch the winter and the summer so 

387.71 390.24 A: mhm yeah i like to watch that too 

390.48 398.78 A: and sometimes they add new sports you know things that are they're trying out like exhibition sports to make sure if they'll make it in the next four years and that's always been fun to watch 

390.67 392.17 B: it's always kind of nice 

398.36 406.60 B: yeah it's it just seems like um they have so much more to offer now and it keeps you really tuned in so 

403.48 404.44 A: mhm 

406.38 414.93 A: yeah like you said about with the dirt bikes and stuff and the way they're doing all those skateboarding tricks and stuff that's i guess they call it the extreme sports those are pretty fun to watch 

414.65 416.03 B: oh yeah 

415.40 418.29 A: scary though sometimes it looks like they're gonna get hurt 

418.82 419.58 A: but 

418.96 423.52 B: yeah it's you know it does look like they're gonna [laughter] get hurt and 

422.73 432.51 A: [laughter] yeah it's it is scary but it's so amazing to watch what they can do it's almost like they're combining gymnastics and all this other stuff all together in one sport 

427.60 429.75 B: and that's what's in right now 

432.51 433.67 B: right 

433.90 443.25 B: you know it's the it's the new big thing you know so many people are into it now and watching it and i see it more and more on t._v. 

436.52 437.48 A: yeah 

443.31 444.42 B: um 

444.81 450.15 B: all the different extreme sports they seem to kinda be taking over like e._s._p._n. and stuff like that 

450.03 459.26 A: oh i know it's on some regular networks 'cause i've seen some stuff but i know who it's gotten so popular they've even done some movies with with that kind of stuff in the movie 

458.92 467.45 B: oh yeah yeah i've seen it they've just [mn] i was at an event this past weekend and they said they were making a movie about it so 

465.95 466.90 A: (( oh wow )) 

467.46 469.68 B: yeah it's getting pretty popular 

469.56 471.20 A: yeah it sure is 

471.31 473.24 B: well i guess they have to kind of 

473.28 476.31 B: m- meet everybody's age level nowadays so 

476.70 482.35 B: and a lotta kids aren't into the whole basketball baseball thing anymore they're more into the extreme stuff so 

481.39 490.18 A: see that's true it do- it does seem like the smaller kids aren't even as interested in the big sports like baseball and what not it it does seem like it's really shifting 

487.79 488.82 B: right 

490.63 496.16 A: like you know that's what i grew up it was the basic three you know basketball baseball football 

496.38 497.32 B: right 

496.87 502.16 A: football i guess isn't that big out here because the los angeles team isn't here anymore 

502.53 503.46 B: right 

502.56 508.54 A: now i've only lived here for about a year but i remember when i lived in saint louis that they got the team that used to be out here so 

508.99 514.72 A: i guess that's not too big on t._v. here i've seen the arena football on there but i don't really watch that 

514.37 518.12 B: yeah i haven't i haven't seen a lot of uh 

519.87 524.93 B: arena football or anything i know my brother watches it but i just i'm not a big fan of it 

524.67 533.25 A: yeah i couldn't even name a team i i like watching um you know the surf boarding when they they do all the tricks out there too in the water that's pretty cool 

532.76 534.39 B: oh yeah those are neat 

534.73 540.57 A: but that doesn't come on that often either i saw it once on p._b._s. there was a special on there and that was pretty interesting 

540.33 543.16 B: yeah i haven't seen anything like that in a while 

543.34 549.67 A: uh-uh [lipsmack] all right i guess we'll just have to look forward to the olympics [laughter] and have have some more choices 

547.48 548.47 B: i know 

549.61 554.52 B: exactly i know it's kinda hard because you don't get to see a whole lot of that but 

554.57 564.49 A: no and i learn about some of the other sports when they're on there you know just because my boyfriend likes 'em and he well we're watching the t._v. he can kinda explain things to me but i 

563.85 564.89 B: right 

564.82 567.61 A: mean i grew up knowing about hockey but never 

567.86 573.55 A: never kinda stayed up with it and now it's pretty popular out here so he's been filling me in on all the rules and stuff 

574.36 579.68 B: yeah i've seen some hockey don't know a whole lot about it every time i see it they're fighting so 

578.79 580.70 A: yeah exactly [laughter] 

580.04 582.92 B: it's like oh this is fun i guess 

581.64 588.27 A: and the t. the t._v. camera gets right in their face and they're [mn] hitting each other with the sticks and it looks crazy 

588.25 589.53 B: oh yeah 

589.99 591.68 A: but i don't know the 

591.85 596.91 A: that's probably the one that's the the craziest one to see on t._v. 'cause it's just so fast paced 

596.73 597.92 B: oh yeah 

597.74 599.89 A: but baseball sometimes you're watching that
