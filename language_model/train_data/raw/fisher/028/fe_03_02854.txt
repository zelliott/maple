145.45 146.14 A: (( uh-huh )) 

147.96 155.53 B: it's kind of like a big i don't know spectacular thing so that's that's maybe the only reason i'm interested 

151.00 151.75 A: [noise] 

155.00 160.86 A: i think it's like true you know and i don't know i mean like this wrestling you know it's

167.13 171.90 A: yeah i think they are actually hurting each other and i don't really like i'm not into that but i 

169.77 170.86 B: yeah 

172.29 174.05 A: think it's more a guy thing 

174.20 181.12 B: yeah yeah it it's yeah i guess that's why you know why why a lotta people are into it 'cause it's very masculine kinda like

367.94 370.38 A: so what other sports we have swimming 

369.50 371.42 B: (( what else do we have [laughter] )) 

370.54 375.46 A: [laughter] swimming i like jumps but you don't see that very often on 

374.83 376.16 B: (( in uh swimming )) 

375.91 376.96 A: yeah 

376.37 379.69 B: yes i like it too 'cause it reminds me of gymnastics a little bit 

379.08 384.91 A: yeah i like gymnastics i did gymnastics when i was growing up like for almost eight years 

385.08 385.98 A: so 

385.15 387.43 B: really are you good were you good 

387.22 391.30 A: i w- i think i was pretty good it helped me to keep sort of in shape 

391.44 396.31 A: you know but um i don't do it anymore but that's a nice sport 

396.40 398.82 A: it it's nothing you know it's 

396.43 397.50 B: yeah 

398.22 400.81 B: is it something that you have to start as a kid 

401.22 406.07 A: yeah i had to do it as a kid i think i started when i was like six and then i was doing 

405.41 409.22 B: no but is it something you can only get good at if you started as a kid 

408.43 415.59 A: i think so because you need to gain the flexibility although like with yoga you know if you do yoga 

416.39 421.72 A: then um i guess you can get better and people do yoga as they are older not 

421.91 423.44 A: (( not younger so )) 

423.89 424.54 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

423.97 435.08 B: 'cause i don't know i am a a dancer for uh ballet and jazz and they always say that [mn] ballet dancing if you wanna get really good you have to start as a child 

428.61 429.79 A: oh wow [cough] 

434.29 435.86 A: mhm 

435.30 438.30 B: so that's why i was wondering if gymnastics might be the same 

436.41 439.78 A: i think i i would think so i you know it's 

440.03 445.64 A: it's a lot of hard work and you have to like practice day in and day out [noise] for the ballet 

446.03 449.44 A: so i think you have to start as a kid [noise] [mn] 

446.23 447.47 B: yeah 

449.42 453.89 B: so um what else is there what about um there was one more though 

453.02 457.38 A: you know what skiing i like sometimes skiing again like the jumps 

454.69 456.01 B: (( yeah skiing )) 

457.24 466.31 B: yeah the jumps yeah yes i sometimes watch it too but that's only because i grew up in germany and they have it big there you know in like austria and switzerland and stuff like that 

458.51 460.04 A: yeah i like [noise] 

463.24 464.05 A: [laughter] 

464.63 466.02 A: yeah yeah 

466.33 474.82 B: but otherwise i think it's kind of sometimes it's only sometimes it's kinda boring though if you think about it that they're like hours and they're just like 

474.16 475.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

474.89 476.60 B: skiing skiing skiing

497.83 501.48 A: yeah it's yeah tradition and probably entertainment 

501.13 502.27 B: mhm
