176.48 181.12 B: you know i'm i'm it's hard for me personally for me it's hard to watch uh 

181.20 184.91 B: it's hard to watch baseball on t._v. because it's uh so slow paced 

184.66 188.82 A: oh yeah i know a lot of people yeah think that way yeah

198.63 201.17 A: and she loves watching that 

200.82 212.08 B: well you know maybe if i had maybe if we had a professional baseball team here it might be different because i didn't start i really didn't start watching basketball on t._v. till we got a professional basketball team 

211.57 213.34 A: mhm 

212.39 218.64 B: and as i say it it it might be different for me if we had a professional uh baseball team
