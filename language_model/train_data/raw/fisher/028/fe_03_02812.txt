104.98 105.91 A: i know 

105.21 111.28 B: 'cause i'm so busy with so many other things that it just doesn't i don't seem to have the time to do that anymore 

110.85 114.79 A: that and the weather's getting so pretty you don't wanna sit in the house 

113.00 114.11 B: oh yeah 

114.16 115.53 B: yeah that too 

115.42 122.47 A: seems like seems like we miss more during the summer than we do we watch more in the winter 'cause there's not as much to do outside 

115.96 116.97 B: yeah some 

118.89 119.99 B: yeah 

120.31 126.62 B: yeah [sigh] i also i i play golf so i'll watch some golf occasionally 

126.43 127.94 B: usually only if 

127.93 129.66 B: like the masters or the 

129.67 132.55 B: the p._g._a. or something or one of the big four 

132.04 133.49 A: yeah 

132.55 145.17 B: tournaments and even then it's usually only the final round on sunday and and i usually don't have time to sit and watch the whole thing 'cause that'll usually be anywhere from six to maybe eight or ten hours coverage so 

145.02 149.92 B: i'll just have it on and just kind of check in occasionally as to how things are going 

149.90 151.07 A: yeah 

150.29 164.38 B: so and i like to i i live close to the cincinnati reds and i like them like to follow them so if they're on t._v. i'll have the t._v. on sometimes if it if they're playing but again it's usually kind of 

164.36 169.53 B: not the primary activity i'll just have it on in the background while i'm doing something else 

169.43 173.61 A: i know we have the titans and the predators reds 

173.19 174.53 B: mhm 

173.85 179.56 A: (( what does the titans play [laughter] is that football or hockey [laughter] )) 

175.70 178.42 B: [laughter] titans are football 

178.68 180.91 B: yeah the titans are football 

180.37 181.32 A: okay 

181.55 182.39 B: so 

181.58 188.65 A: see how much i keep up with it [laughter] i just know that two of our groups are [laughter] like the predators are 

182.82 184.28 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

186.68 187.76 B: mhm 

188.75 189.71 A: hockey 

189.68 191.81 B: yeah i think the predators are hockey 

189.83 190.84 A: (( maybe [noise] )) 

192.07 194.67 B: that's not something that i watch very much 

194.71 200.37 B: um you know i i love the olympics and i watch the ho- hockey in the olympics 

200.32 201.62 A: yeah 

200.44 205.80 B: when they're on but other than that i don't really watch hockey very much at all 

206.37 211.42 A: i don't think ever i know i've never seen a whole game i might have seen two seconds of one but it's a 

206.60 207.16 B: (( [mn] )) 

209.65 210.51 B: yeah 

211.00 220.35 B: yeah well like i said usually the only time i watch it is during the olympics and i'll i'll watch the matches then but that's about it 

218.86 219.90 A: i usually 

219.95 223.28 A: we'll watch football but it's usually just the superbowl 

222.95 224.07 B: yeah 

223.46 230.21 A: 'cause me and the kids they i pick by the team color [laughter] and they pick by you know they think they know it 

226.80 228.94 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

229.85 231.30 B: mhm 

230.74 233.51 A: so we always have a little superbowl thing going on 

232.90 234.20 B: yeah 

234.75 242.33 A: but other than that i don't watch it's just boxing and we've been watching some of the lumberjack just out of sheer boredom there's nothing else to watch 

241.23 243.26 B: [mn] mm yeah 

243.27 249.89 B: yeah i'm not uh i watch college basketball so i'm like during the m._c._a._a. tournament 'cause i 

249.96 256.54 B: uh when i was in college our team was it was real good still is and and so i got into that so 

256.38 266.34 B: i'll watch that but again usually only during the tournament time not as a regular basis but i really don't have much of any use for pro basketball at all it's 

266.73 272.24 B: i have never really gotten into the pro basketball very much at all 

270.22 272.72 A: yeah no i haven't either 

272.39 273.70 B: yeah 

272.90 276.06 A: (( i don't know it seems like there's too much sports to watch )) 

276.09 276.67 A: (( [laughter] )) 

276.49 278.63 B: yeah yeah 

278.19 283.10 A: it seems like any you know weekend our channels are just full of some kind of sport 

282.45 285.50 B: oh yeah yeah so 

284.52 291.35 A: and finding a good a good old movie to watch is almost impossible i mean we got a hundred and something channels and nothing to watch 

287.00 288.09 B: mhm 

288.42 289.29 B: yeah 

291.25 294.77 B: yeah [laughter] yeah i know what you mean there uh 

291.87 293.66 A: [laughter] 

295.07 303.64 B: i've never been big into racing or anything like that either a lot i know a lot of people around here are big into nascar or into indy racing and stuff like that but that's just never 

303.37 305.45 A: yeah they are around here 

304.00 306.47 B: or anything that's ever interested me either 

306.38 314.13 A: the only thing i like in as far as racing goes is if there's a dirt track we you hardly e- we hardly ever see anymore 

310.84 311.61 B: (( mm )) 

313.66 314.83 B: yeah 

314.26 317.85 A: now and i do like demolition derbies [laughter] 

316.43 317.46 B: [laughter] 

317.56 319.05 B: (( yeah )) 

319.41 323.96 B: yeah that used to that kind of stuff used to be on a whole lot more than it is now 

323.85 324.94 A: yeah 

324.02 337.52 B: you know it used to be especially i i used to love wide world of sports on saturdays i'd watch that they would have demolition derbies on quite a bit and they would have sometimes the dirt track racing and stuff like that but you're right you don't see that 

328.96 330.22 A: yeah 

337.17 341.56 A: no everything's i think's gone so commercial and the money game that 

337.61 338.44 B: on 

339.60 340.60 B: yeah 

341.85 346.02 A: they forget about us little people that likes the regular sports [laughter] 

343.43 344.36 B: [laughter] 

344.52 345.71 B: yeah 

346.04 347.22 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

346.80 349.90 A: those of us that's non athletic [laughter] 

348.88 362.12 B: mhm mhm [lipsmack] and the other the other sport that i love is soccer and of course most people don't like it a lot of people don't even understand it but and i didn't really either until my kids 

362.14 368.11 B: were growing up and and they got into it soccer is a real good sport for kids yeah 

366.66 369.90 A: it is my both my boys played when they were younger 

368.53 376.36 B: yeah and uh i i got into it then when they were in and i started helping coach their teams and stuff like that so 

376.40 386.04 B: i then um just de- ended up developing an interest i actually ended up playing for a while myself in some adult leagues and um 

384.87 389.64 A: well that seemed like the only sport that they could play where people weren't screaming at 'em 

389.25 391.62 B: [laughter] yeah 

389.98 402.51 A: and um i don't know how it is where you're at but down here you know if you play softball the coach just literally screams at these little bitty kids and i wouldn't let my kids play you know we play as a family or something but i'm like no [laughter] 

397.16 398.45 B: yeah i know 

399.78 400.55 B: yep 

401.01 401.98 B: yeah 

402.65 412.03 B: yep i know well in fact that's one of the reasons i got into coaching the kids was because i couldn't tolerate some of the things that some of their coaches were doing 

406.14 407.79 A: mhm 

411.85 413.09 A: mhm 

412.14 419.81 B: and so i started even though i didn't know anything about it i started learning stuff about it so i could i could uh be the one in charge 

419.60 423.58 A: yeah when you start taking it that serious you take all the fun out of the sport 

419.89 421.04 B: and uh 

422.57 431.72 B: well yeah it's it's just ridiculous i mean kids are gonna get competitive enough later in life they don't need to do that at five years old 

427.83 428.66 A: (( right )) 

428.68 430.17 A: exactly 

431.17 441.94 A: no and well i've i've literally sit there and seen parents fighting in the sand you know they're little bitty kids out there doing their best and then they're like little kids playing t-ball [noise] 

431.76 432.56 B: (( you know )) 

435.55 436.77 B: oh yeah 

438.66 439.66 B: yep 

441.25 442.58 B: yep 

442.05 450.51 A: and i told my kids i say you can play t-ball i go and play with you but as far as the organized part no i'm not gonna have you subject to that kind of abuse and 

450.03 452.20 B: yep i agree 

452.03 457.99 A: and i guess that's why you know we're maybe that's why we're not ne- as you know bigger sports fans than what we are 

456.48 457.50 B: mhm 

457.63 459.11 B: mhm 

459.95 466.67 B: yep that could be it's well i- i think it turns kids off i think it can really turn kids off to the sports and stuff 

466.04 468.54 A: [noise] oh i think it can too [noise] 

467.07 471.88 B: and uh like i said that's one of the reasons that i took over and started coaching 

472.00 483.51 B: some of my kids' teams because i won't do that and the other thing that i hated was that um that so many of the coaches even five six seven eight year olds were into winning 

483.31 485.29 A: mhm 

483.66 495.61 B: the games and that's not what it's about at that age they need to learn how to play and [lipsmack] and they would you know kind of win at all costs you know only play their favorite players or their best players and this and that and the other and i said that's ridiculous 

486.54 487.28 A: (( no )) 

495.23 496.33 A: it is 

495.55 498.74 B: at that age that's just that's not right so 

498.43 499.43 A: no 

498.68 506.63 B: when i took over the teams i started you know i was coaching them and i was letting every kid played an equal amount of time no matter who they were 

506.49 515.40 B: and um everybody started at you know at we- i just had a rotation for who would start and who would sit on the bench and stuff like that so that everybody got to start 

515.43 528.06 B: equal amounts of time and stuff like that and the parents certainly appreciated it although i even then it was funny i got a few of 'em came to me and said you know we could win more games if you would do that it's like [sigh] 

528.09 537.26 B: well yeah we probably could but i don't care [laughter] quite honestly 'cause it's not what it's about right now they need to learn how to play the game they can learn about winning later 

528.09 528.95 A: yeah 

531.77 533.18 A: yeah and 

536.80 551.56 A: and they hear on t._v. um michael jordan or so and so is getting so many million dollars to play and my son says i guess my four square is out of the question cos he's got bad knees i said honey there is too much other stuff out there you can be 

540.91 541.92 B: oh yeah 

542.36 543.41 B: oh yeah 

543.60 544.47 B: yep 

546.70 547.93 B: [laughter] 

548.71 549.46 B: (( yep )) 

551.15 562.69 B: yep well and that's another one of the things that kind of turns me off to watching professional sports too quite frankly i mean i'm sorry but i don't think anybody is worth twenty million dollars a year to play a game 

556.81 558.53 A: yeah it is 

561.04 562.28 A: me either 

562.54 563.22 A: (( no )) 

562.78 566.77 B: and uh and it's you know i i think that 

567.15 575.40 B: because of that prices to go actually go to a game have gotten so out of hand that you can't even go anymore 

575.12 576.03 A: yeah 

575.44 589.20 B: and i used to be a lot more interested when i was a kid and we could go down to the ball park you know my parents would take me to the to the ball game [lipsmack] and it would cost 'em you know ten bucks for the whole family to go for the day now it's just ridiculous 

588.77 591.91 A: (( it is you can go to an amusement park [laughter] )) 

589.24 597.86 B: you know and when you can't g- really go to the games then i think it's not ea- as easy to be interested in 'em on t._v. 

597.77 599.89 A: no because they it's it you can-
