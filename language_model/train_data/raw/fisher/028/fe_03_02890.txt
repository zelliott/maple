200.89 201.48 A: (( mm )) 

202.45 215.61 A: soccer's just now getting started in schools down here i don't [sigh] i don't know that it's even on t._v. that much i don't i don't remember seeing it but it's just now getting started in the schools down here so i think my grandchildren are going to like soccer 

212.26 215.69 B: [lipsmack] it's it's not as popular here [mn] i 

216.34 223.07 B: think it's definitely a great sport it's not as popular as it is in in europe and stuff south america obviously it's number one down there 

219.89 221.36 A: mhm 

223.24 232.96 B: it's you know they have fairly professional teams they just don't get the uh the exposure you know football and baseball is just too huge and then and then 

227.06 229.33 A: the exposure mhm 

231.13 236.04 A: well fo- football and baseball kinda take over of course we've just in rome they've just uh 

234.00 235.75 B: (( oh yeah )) 

236.39 240.71 A: [noise] put up a uh new stadium for the braves to play the 

241.14 243.07 A: (( farm team they call it )) 

242.32 244.89 B: [mn] yeah the farm okay that's cool 

243.54 247.19 A: so uh that's real hot in this area now 

247.51 249.51 B: yeah that'd be fun to go down there 

249.71 255.30 B: (( watch a watch a coupla games no that that'd be fun definitely [lipsmack] but um yeah [lipsmack] [laughter] )) 

250.78 252.92 A: (( [noise] mhm mm mhm )) 

254.16 258.40 A: baseball i guess i understand better than the other sports maybe that's why 

258.55 259.55 A: i don't 

258.75 260.84 B: that helps definitely 

259.67 265.85 A: yeah i i don't understand the other sports that much so i just they they're just not appealing to me that much 

265.75 272.20 B: no definitely if you don't un- if you don't know the rules if you don't know the finer points of the game you're not going to appreciate it as much as someone else 

270.85 272.75 A: mhm that's true 

272.77 275.56 B: that goes with any sport it goes with anything like even 

275.76 281.68 B: even music you know if you never tried to play a guitar you never appreciate how hard it is you know what i mean but uh 

279.05 280.16 A: that's true 

280.61 286.04 A: [laughter] i i guess probably if if i had to say how many hours i watch sports 

286.18 289.73 A: a week it'd be maybe an hour if that much 

289.26 291.84 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

290.31 294.34 A: so it's not high on my list of priorities you can tell 

293.82 294.82 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

294.99 301.74 B: i don't even have cable i'm not i don't get i don't get a to- i don't get you know sports channels coming in anyway at home 

299.69 303.87 A: mhm [noise] well we have satellite so we have the sports channels but 

303.88 305.99 A: we just don't watch 'em that often 

306.54 314.28 B: but baseball is yeh if if you have a favorite team that helps too somebody you actually have an emotional connection with but otherwise baseball 

310.89 312.16 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

314.37 318.94 B: for any sport but baseball can be kinda boring just takes too long between pitches and 

319.31 324.05 B: it depends if it's you know championships or something that's a little different but 

322.46 324.18 A: like the world series [laughter] 

324.38 330.87 B: yeah i'm not such a [laughter] dedicated fan i couldn't sit down and watch a hundred games a season and just oof 

325.32 326.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

330.90 335.22 B: if you're at the stadium that's different the whole it's a different experience but you know 

335.56 341.91 B: through a three hour or four hour baseball game you're just sitting there in your living room that's pretty gets pretty boring [laughter] [mn] 

339.54 345.39 A: yeah it it is kinda long i mean even at the stadium that's a long time when you get right down to it 

345.22 346.90 B: yeah it's a long game 

346.31 354.95 A: i mean that that's a long game and and football with you know they can drag out a football team i mean football game sometimes too it seems like 

354.68 365.45 B: [noise] it could 'cause well because of overtime but baseball can go so many innings you ne- nev- never know even hockey can get hockey can go long because they've got double triple overtime 

357.31 358.35 A: mhm 

360.94 362.29 A: mhm 

365.50 366.75 B: but i can 

365.51 371.81 A: that's something i've i don't watch very often we just they just don't show it down here that much the hockey games 

368.96 369.94 B: yeah 

370.32 378.11 B: well nashville's got a team but uh yeah hockey's obviously not going to be very big down south [laughter] not many ice rinks down south so much 

375.18 376.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

376.78 377.66 A: (( well )) 

378.62 387.20 B: but hockey's kinda yeah you need to know you need to know some of the finer points of the game and it's kinda too fast that game is almost too fast for people to get into it 

383.87 388.15 A: it looks dangerous to me too [laughter] bloody [mn] 

388.06 392.86 B: yeah there's often fighting is kind of a part of it which some people probably wouldn't like either 

392.36 393.72 A: mhm 

393.18 402.48 B: but it's so hard to even sometimes it's really hard just to follow the puck and know what happened [laughter] you don't know what happened till five seconds after it happened sometimes it's i mean it's a fast game 

396.84 397.80 A: mhm 

399.82 404.58 A: yeah you can trying to keep up with it and who's got it and all that sort of stuff 

404.58 417.80 B: yeah [laughter] i mean that's what they tried doing a coupla years ago they tried highlighting the puck i don't know if you remember that it's like a red dot they put like a red or blue or fuzzy thing around it the t._v. studio did 

405.08 406.72 A: (( but um [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

417.87 418.87 A: (( oh okay )) 

417.96 420.73 B: just to try to help people find it but 

419.53 423.70 A: oh okay well i didn't remember that [laughter] [laughter] 

421.25 425.56 B: that didn't last too long yeah they i think they did it for half a season or something you know so 

424.62 426.10 A: and it didn't work 

426.21 429.41 B: i guess not people didn't like it 

427.03 427.67 A: (( [laughter] )) 

428.37 439.94 A: well [sigh] well i tell you this topic's hard for me [laughter] they should have given they should have had men talking to men about this topic [laughter]

432.43 434.10 B: [laughter] 

440.00 441.97 B: [noise] yeah i guess that would help 

441.63 442.36 A: (( mm )) 

442.14 451.22 B: i'm surprised i didn't know the study was so large i didn't think i thought it was just pennsylvania people u. penn 'cause i live near u. penn the school that's doing it obviously
