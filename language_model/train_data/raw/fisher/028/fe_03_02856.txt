226.19 226.89 A: mm 

227.73 229.23 A: yeah it sounds fun 

230.04 233.28 B: and weight weightlifting could be a sport too 

230.19 231.16 A: but uh 

233.44 239.73 A: [noise] yeah yeah i i'd need to get more in shape and do more sports just to be healthier 

239.42 240.45 B: right 

240.16 241.98 A: nothing else um 

241.83 244.65 B: and it relieves stress which is good 

243.14 250.23 A: yeah yeah and and we always need that [laughter] yeah so um [lipsmack] 

246.20 247.41 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

250.50 254.31 A: let's see um did you play any sports when you were in high school 

254.82 256.44 B: not really 

256.49 262.13 B: just like um in gym but i never signed up for teams 'cause i was always so paranoid like if 

262.32 264.03 B: i wouldn't do good 

263.43 264.54 A: yeah 

264.23 266.12 B: in the team what would happen 

266.28 268.83 B: you know you feel like you're pressured 

266.32 267.63 A: yeah 

268.68 274.87 A: yeah it's a lot of pressure to perform and to do good and you're afraid of what your team mates are gonna say if you you know 

274.65 276.02 B: don't right 

275.13 278.07 A: you don't or you mess up you do something wrong 

277.72 279.05 B: mhm 

278.51 280.02 A: yeah 

279.13 281.05 B: did you join any sports 

280.74 281.87 A: um 

282.10 289.48 A: well i played soccer and i w- i always wanted to play softball but i never had enough courage to go out and try [laughter] 

289.28 290.60 B: right 

290.03 300.70 A: yeah that was always a sport that seemed fun for me but i was just too afraid of not not being able to play right or not being good at it so i'd rather just not do it [sigh] 

301.05 304.37 B: and plus it's tough like as you said you have to um 

304.81 307.56 B: you don't wanna be disappointing to your team either 

307.25 313.62 A: yeah i mean you always wanna do good so it sometimes that keeps you from trying new stuff 'cause 

312.97 314.63 B: right 'cause um [lipsmack] 

314.78 318.14 B: when i was signing up to go to high school i went to a trade school 

318.21 325.73 B: and i was thinking to myself i'm gonna do all these sports and i never did 'em 'cause you get once you know people you just like 

326.14 328.74 B: i don't know like you feel like you're pressured 

328.01 334.72 A: [noise] yeah well and if they didn't if they weren't the type of crowd who was involved in sports you feel like you gotta go with the crowd and do what they're doing 

334.45 335.46 B: right 

334.84 337.66 A: you know so you don't wanna deviate from them 

338.12 343.89 A: and um yeah but um a lotta sports watching my my dad all my 

343.77 354.54 A: my dad and my brother everybody played soccer so a lot of going to games and watching games and my dad was a coach and so th- always around but um

354.58 365.86 A: haven't done it recently i need to get back in i'd like it's good exercise [noise] i mean you run yeah you just run and run [laughter] so um but yeah i i always wanted to try other sports i just never 

358.14 359.65 B: mhm it is 

359.69 360.93 B: just move around 

366.10 372.02 A: i'm not tall enough to play basketball [laughter] which all um seems like a fun sport 

367.91 368.83 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

372.17 374.60 A: but [noise] yeah 

372.28 373.37 B: it is 

373.70 378.86 B: but if you get like you know some people your height or a little taller than you then you're fine 

379.53 380.58 B: to play 

380.25 384.92 A: yeah yeah so how long did you play altogether

417.45 418.50 B: mhm 

418.37 425.30 A: [mn] i'm gonna be more involved around um sports now that my kids are getting older and they're participating 

425.48 428.16 B: that'd be good for them too so they meet people 

425.56 426.47 A: [noise] 

428.10 434.01 A: yeah [noise] yeah it's good about socializing and yeah 

428.59 431.46 B: that's a good thing about participating in sports 

432.33 436.45 B: right and then when they get into high school scholarships for college 

436.03 451.00 A: oh i know that's great [noise] that's that's always good and then [noise] you know it's just a good social and it builds confidence when they can do it and [sigh] it's healthy 'cause so many kids are overweight [noise] now and you know there just sedentary they don't do anything so it's good to

597.84 598.66 B: right
