490.11 491.08 A: yeah 

495.27 496.27 A: oh 

495.67 502.06 B: i was like uh and then it had been quite a while and i thought well maybe they just passed me over or something and 

501.18 507.03 A: that's what i thought too because the one time they called i was just sitting down to dinner so i thought no i'm not gonna do it now 

503.83 504.40 B: (( [noise] )) 

506.57 508.03 B: (( right [noise] )) 

507.14 511.38 A: uh another time i was just making dinner or baking or something and another time i wasn't in 

511.16 517.26 B: yeah but the good news is i did in fact just this afternoon i read that somebody did receive a check 

516.42 517.81 A: oh excellent 

518.15 521.28 A: oh that's super so how'd you find about it 

521.11 522.07 B: um 

521.61 523.98 A: from a message board uh-huh 

522.55 528.50 B: yeah um cathy plum's message board

533.25 536.45 B: [noise] yeah i think it's called cathy c. c. two 

537.01 541.62 A: yeah i know which one you're talking about yeah well that's good i'm glad someone got their check 

537.03 537.95 B: (( i don't know )) 

541.32 543.12 B: [sigh] yeah yeah 

541.88 544.32 A: and i was surprised that they were taking canadians 

544.10 547.08 B: yeah i heard that too that discussed about that [noise] 

546.43 549.49 A: yeah because i got the email back they know i'm canadian 

549.57 551.08 A: and um 

551.12 555.56 A: the uh application didn't say anything about not taking canadians so i thought well why not 

553.91 558.17 B: [noise] [noise] good good 

555.84 556.97 A: mhm 

558.22 561.63 B: yeah i haven't figured out exactly what their goal is on this but 

562.04 563.33 A: i'm not sure either 

562.09 562.78 B: that's 

563.10 566.22 B: because they asked all the questions on what kind of phone you're using 

566.22 567.12 A: mhm 

566.50 569.64 B: so maybe that's what it's about more so than anything else 

569.68 572.16 A: i was thinking maybe for the recording device 

572.73 576.32 B: oh okay testing out their recording device on different types of phones [noise] 

574.92 578.41 A: to make sure that they have it on um a different level 

578.17 579.33 B: that could be 

578.75 582.43 A: maybe because they've gotta adjust it if you were on like a speaker phone 

582.42 583.59 B: right 

582.68 584.98 A: but they can um hear you better 

584.75 585.66 B: right 

585.25 586.43 A: that was my 

585.94 586.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

586.68 588.27 A: that was my assumption 

588.29 589.52 B: yeah 

588.88 590.27 A: yeah 

589.70 591.41 B: (( that would make sense )) 

590.80 592.61 A: it would wouldn't it do you m._s.
