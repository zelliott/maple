282.11 283.20 B: john mad- 

282.23 285.32 A: yeah sometimes we just turn that off and we just watch the game

309.41 310.29 B: yeah

390.42 391.53 A: yeah 

391.46 396.87 B: i i kind of slows down after you're running around crazy doing this that and the other thing and just

397.25 398.16 B: (( you know ))

419.57 420.76 A: (( oh yeah )) 

422.51 429.68 B: [lipsmack] again i think it's uh the excellence of uh the performance but i i think in terms of uh 

429.78 433.97 B: what the t._v.'s you know what they do is is terrific 

433.62 435.28 A: yeah yeah 

434.78 440.17 B: sometimes it's over the top you know and you're thinking oh come on you know and it gets you know 

438.62 445.64 A: yeah well i like when you know all the personal fouls and stuff sometimes you could tell that you know they did it on purpose you know or 

442.90 443.85 B: mhm 

445.01 446.01 B: (( oh yeah )) 

445.44 456.60 A: and when the somebody falls and you're like come on you didn't really get hit that hard [laughter] we know you just wanted time out [laughter] so yeah that's that's pretty exciting for us 

449.03 450.60 B: right yeah 

451.38 453.31 B: that's right that's right 

453.61 454.68 B: (( i know )) 

456.10 459.22 B: yeah and i enjoy the interviews with them afterwards 

459.20 460.38 A: oh yeah 

459.63 470.19 B: you know i think that's neat to honor them for their excellence and um i think the commentators do a pretty good go- i don't have a problem with the women doing it at all then i i think that 

463.28 464.60 A: yeah 

469.11 479.66 A: i know one of the i don't have a problem with that either i don't i don't know why some people do other than it's been men for so long that some people don't like change [lipsmack] so they're kinda like what 

471.58 472.57 B: yeah 

473.58 474.45 B: yeah 

475.85 476.71 B: right 

477.30 478.27 B: right 

478.56 489.13 B: but yeah there's been a lot of discussion about that idea of women doing commenta- they don't belong there they'll say well sh- why not they know the game why can't they be down there doing it you know 

488.01 490.59 A: yeah they know just as much as you do 

489.94 501.85 B: yeah i think it it gets a little bit much when the gals go into the guys locker rooms however and you know then it it it puts the men at little embarrassing situation i 

490.62 491.88 A: other than you're not 

495.01 497.37 A: [laughter] yeah 

501.13 505.04 A: yeah just keep 'em on the court you don't need to go into the room [laughter] 

501.93 502.47 B: (( i )) 

502.70 506.21 B: you know really it's that's just that's for sure 

505.91 507.00 A: yeah 

506.36 509.73 B: (( but um yeah i do i enjoy all the )) 

509.81 512.21 B: all the fun of that and um 

512.48 520.16 B: [lipsmack] sometimes if i don't even know what's going on it's just fun being part of what a lot of people are doing like a super bowl or 

519.80 534.25 A: oh yeah we had a super bowl party and we did like a betting pool for each like quarter and that wa- and even people that didn't you know care for football were excited because they wanted to see if they were gonna win you know i mean it it just brings you into the game so 

520.49 521.36 B: (( you know )) 

523.44 525.19 B: yeah mhm 

527.21 528.75 B: yeah yeah 

530.39 531.73 B: (( that's right )) 

533.36 538.53 B: right and and and it's kind of what everybody is doing in the u._s. at that particular time 

538.10 539.16 A: yeah 

538.61 539.87 B: but um 

540.08 542.05 A: everybody else is doing the same thing 

541.34 543.39 B: no i i like to be um 

543.50 545.26 B: a part of that crowd 

545.02 545.93 A: yeah 

546.24 550.43 B: we have some fine um commentators for our um 

550.61 553.71 B: well i'm sure you have them out in california too but [mn] 

553.95 559.88 B: we love our uh particularly the phillies uh baseball commentators and t._v. guys 

559.66 560.97 A: oh okay 

560.00 569.34 B: and uh richie ashburn was one of them but he recently died and it was like losing one of the major heroes of the united states 

563.73 564.89 A: (( oh )) 

568.82 571.87 A: yeah i think that was like it when chick hern died too 

571.31 572.82 B: yeah uh-huh 

571.90 573.85 A: people felt the same way 

573.24 574.79 B: (( yeah )) 

574.29 580.26 A: so i mean you're so used to hearing you know hearing that person every time you watch that game 

574.92 575.62 B: you 

579.71 580.96 B: that's right 

580.34 585.25 A: and they're they g- they travel with them you know you're just always expecting them to be there 

582.39 583.27 B: yeah 

584.72 585.93 B: mhm 

585.31 589.52 A: i don't i don't think he'd even missed one game his whole entire career 

588.99 589.95 B: (( really )) 

589.61 592.19 A: yeah he we- he went with them everywhere 

591.55 593.23 B: mhm mhm 

592.43 599.89 A: so that's that's amazing you know that's his job and to think he never called in sick [laughter] you're like wow 

593.88 594.90 B: yeah 

596.82 599.95 B: that's right yeah quite a lesson isn't it
