24.80 26.76 A: but he likes baseball too 

27.35 29.22 B: you got lucky then [laughter] [noise] 

28.59 33.32 A: yeah so we we watch a lot this time of year and only the yankees 

33.50 35.80 B: only the yankees you in new york 

35.35 37.24 A: well we're from new york 

37.53 40.52 A: um but we live in virginia beach virginia now 

41.18 45.76 A: and my daughter is ten and she loves the yankees too 

45.69 46.70 B: oh oh does she 

46.32 47.45 A: yes 

47.22 54.49 B: my daughter loves football when i can watch it but [noise] the last year the only team that i got to watch was ohio state versus michigan game 

54.21 55.42 A: mhm 

55.36 57.96 B: so that was the only one i got to watch last year 

57.95 61.36 A: well it's hard with football because it's only on sundays 

61.52 64.68 B: right well there's uh college is on saturdays which 

64.11 65.47 A: oh okay 

64.91 66.99 B: is really cool and then 

65.93 67.06 A: mhm 

67.05 70.72 B: towards the end of the season they've got some on thursday nights 

70.36 71.99 A: oh do they really 

72.01 76.24 B: yeah they've got pro games it's that are on thursday nights too 

73.03 74.03 A: (( see [mn] )) 

75.97 77.22 A: mhm 

77.80 82.84 A: see i don't like football my husband watches golf and i'll watch that sometimes with him 

82.80 83.69 B: uh-huh 

83.58 92.56 A: but we just ordered the major league extra innings sports package 'cause we can get almost every yankee game that way 

93.04 97.60 A: so we watch yeah so we watch a yankee game almost every night this time of year 

93.21 94.73 B: oh well that'll work 

99.20 104.25 B: my brother in law loves to watch sports he doesn't care what kind it is he'll be in front of the t._v. it 

103.67 105.61 A: really see 

104.57 107.74 B: used to be big football but now they're in the nascar 

107.50 109.65 A: oh that would drive me crazy 

109.74 120.98 A: my father in law loves nascar and i just can't sit there and watch them go around and around [laughter] it drives me crazy do you like nascar 

121.01 123.58 B: um sometimes i watch it with my dad 

123.33 124.56 A: mhm 

124.09 125.48 B: and he'll um 

126.16 134.63 B: he'll come and go he'll sit in the garage and then he'll come out and watch the game for a few minutes then he'll go back to doing what he has to do then he'll come watch the game for a few minutes so 

134.50 135.68 A: mhm 

135.77 143.03 A: well i like the baseball games that um you know 'cause uh me and my husband and my daughter we can all three of us sit down 

143.16 151.29 A: and watch 'em together you know 'cause uh a- we found that at night we'd be watching one thing and she'd be upstairs watching another 

143.74 144.34 B: (( mm )) 

146.22 147.04 B: yeah 

151.35 158.03 A: so the the major league extra innings package was expensive but we figured it was worth it 

157.94 159.49 B: good for family time 

159.08 171.19 A: mhm so like i said we we get almost every yankee game even though they lost the past two nights but [laughter] at least we can all sit down together and watch something that we all wanna watch all wanna see 

160.48 161.69 B: that would be good 

171.21 172.85 B: right that you can all enjoy 

172.59 175.36 A: right and so far it's worked out pretty good 

174.91 177.15 B: and you know it's safe for your daughter to watch 

176.95 186.64 A: that's another thing too 'cause sometimes she'll come down even from watching nickelodeon and she'll say that there was like a commercial on there or something that's like really rude 

184.73 185.53 B: (( yeah )) 

186.72 187.56 B: (( yes )) 

186.81 197.96 A: and so and with um the a lotta the yankee games they're on the yankee network so all of their commercials usually have to do with the other shows that are on that channel 

192.20 193.02 B: right 

198.06 201.79 B: right are they some type of baseball or softball or something [noise] 

198.35 199.24 A: see 

201.39 208.65 A: yeah 'cause i find with football some of the commercials are just like the beer commercials with bikini girls and stuff 

205.47 206.65 B: off the wall 

208.43 209.33 B: right 

209.33 213.38 A: i don't particularly agree with that especially if my daughter's sitting there 

213.69 217.10 A: but with the baseball you don't get that like you do with football 

213.76 214.87 B: yeah 

218.76 224.64 B: that's true i guess it's a different clientele that watches football than it does that watches baseball 

224.08 231.84 A: i guess i don't know and with golf too you get a lot of like cadillac car commercials and investment commercials 

231.69 241.80 A: and you know golf commercials but you don't get the beer guzzling guys with girls in bikinis and stuff like that watching golf like you do 

241.93 243.97 A: with football i don't know why 

243.80 247.52 B: [noise] well with golf they're more more apt to be like the um 

248.33 255.26 B: the heavier drinks or not really heavier drinks but mixed drinks and stuff like that 'cause it's more of the upper class that do golf [noise] 

255.42 258.08 A: i guess i don't know 

258.76 265.06 B: 'cause down here every development that they have they've got a little golf course stuck in it somewhere even if it's just a partial one 

264.73 266.07 A: where are you 

266.03 267.25 B: in florida 

266.84 270.76 A: mhm well yeah 'cause you got a large retirement community down there too 

270.65 271.61 B: yeah 

271.05 283.34 A: um it's getting like that here and they're building a lot of golf courses around here and i don't i don't mind watching the golf so much on t._v. but most of the time i take a nap [laughter] 

282.98 284.93 B: (( [laughter] nap time )) 

284.11 287.67 A: especially when football's on then i definitely take a nap 

287.71 288.64 B: yeah 

288.71 292.93 A: but i i just don't no base- well baseball's really the only sport 

292.11 297.25 B: [noise] but i try to watch the football but after about [noise] 

297.52 304.41 B: maybe a quarter or two then he's like uh this is all sick they're all pretending it's all like a soap opera so 

304.42 305.96 B: i give up [laughter] 

304.58 313.00 A: [laughter] [laughter] that's unusual 'cause usually it's the husband that wants to watch the football 

307.82 308.49 B: hm 

309.33 309.99 B: (( okay )) 

312.88 317.16 B: i grew up watching football when i graduated school i just loved football 

317.73 321.28 A: my sister in law and my mother in law love football 

321.28 334.81 A: and they watch it every sunday they love the giants and my daughter loves all kinds of sport so so that's good you know she doesn't like to watch golf but she'll sit and watch football with my husband 

334.34 335.38 B: mhm 

334.83 341.68 A: and she enjoys watching baseball we don't we never put nascar on we're just not into it 

337.73 338.29 B: (( [noise] )) 

341.35 345.30 B: yeah the only type of sporting stuff that he likes to watch would be like hunting 

345.41 346.52 B: or fishing 

347.00 348.32 B: that type of thing 

348.52 351.99 A: oh so you guy- do you guys get that in nature channel 

352.33 353.40 B: um 

352.43 355.57 A: that have all those fishing shows and stuff 

355.33 357.56 B: i think that's what he watches i just 

357.63 360.01 B: go an- go out and do something else 

359.49 370.06 A: [laughter] that's what i would do too i don't every once in a while my husband starts on that fishing channel he's like wow look at that fish i'm like why are you watching this 

369.84 377.15 B: yeah it doesn't enthuse me to watch somebody catch a fish and then turn it back loose again if you're gonna go through the trouble to catch a fish why not eat it 

376.90 382.59 A: i kind of agree and i just don't think it's exciting sitting there watching somebody else 

382.61 384.05 A: catch a fish 

384.06 387.56 B: or sit there for a half an hour in a tree while they're trying to catch a deer [noise] 

387.29 388.62 A: oh yeah 

387.73 390.45 B: or turkey or whatever else they're trying to get 

390.25 397.08 A: well i don't know if your husband hunts [noise] but my husband doesn't and he just he kinda makes fun of people that do sit in a tree 

397.23 400.18 A: and cover themselves in deer urine 

397.25 398.17 B: yeah 

400.82 401.74 B: yeah 

401.21 406.38 A: so they don't smell you know so they smell like the forest and stuff [laughter] 

405.77 406.74 B: right 

407.12 408.05 B: yeah 

408.17 409.63 A: i just think that that's 

408.85 415.88 B: but he's never done it he's just now fascinated with the idea of it but he just watches it on t._v. 

413.56 414.88 A: mhm 

415.60 416.79 A: mhm 

417.29 420.86 A: mm see i would think that that's boring watching it on t._v. 

417.75 418.83 B: oh um 

420.65 421.99 B: uh to me it is 

422.51 423.07 A: (( mm )) 

422.64 426.58 B: but i'd love to watch football even my daughter got into watching football [mn] 

426.19 427.66 A: (( how old's your daughter )) 

427.73 430.02 B: i've gotten one six and one three 

429.95 433.13 A: oh so that'd be fun to sit down and watch football with them 

432.87 433.99 B: mhm 

434.87 437.24 B: they don't understand it yet but we're trying 

434.96 435.60 A: they 

437.75 443.11 A: well do you have like another t._v. where if he doesn't wanna watch football you guys could go watch football 

443.02 445.19 B: no we've only got one t._v. right now 

447.47 449.52 B: but when we w- one they're over 

448.10 451.83 A: i can't imagine only having one tv [laughter] 

453.00 454.83 A: that would drive me crazy 

456.68 465.99 B: yeah see our kids in the evenings he watches the documentaries i would rather sit there and watch a football game as opposed to watching a documentary about something that happened a long time ago 

465.67 466.84 A: right 

466.49 468.03 B: you have no control over 

468.05 471.10 A: [laughter] that's funny 

471.24 476.06 B: when my daughter gets older and she can understand it and it's part of history lessons okay we'll work it in 

475.76 484.17 A: right right well tell him next time you're going somewhere else so your daughter and you can your daughters and you can watch the football games 

476.89 477.58 B: hm 

483.94 485.13 B: (( [noise] there you go )) 

484.70 487.60 A: then maybe he'll he'll leave it on for ya 

488.34 493.37 B: [noise] could be 'cause my father does watch football he watches all kinds of sports too 

493.21 494.45 A: yeah 

494.25 495.53 B: yeah 

495.18 499.29 A: um like it just it just seems like every time i turn around we have um 

499.63 509.55 A: the t._v. on for some kind of sports whether it's golf or baseball or in the winter time football but that's it we i don't like basketball 

509.46 511.72 B: [noise] i've watched hockey hockey's cool 

511.50 514.03 A: see i haven't really gotten into hockey 

514.18 514.96 B: yeah

516.82 521.10 B: um every now and then it's on not as often as the rest of the sports 

520.59 521.74 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

522.79 524.05 B: but not 

522.80 526.03 A: i wonder why i guess it's like not as popular 

525.94 528.09 B: probably not as popular right now 

527.77 529.24 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

528.88 530.00 B: it's out 

530.18 535.49 B: you used to see more football than you do but now you see more of the nascar because the seasons overlap 

535.76 541.22 A: oh yeah well where we are it's big nascar country 

541.25 542.21 B: (( mhm )) 

541.95 545.41 A: so there's oh the races are always on t._v.

570.55 575.52 A: so we're all my husband and i grew up yankee fans so she's a yankee fan 

575.74 579.40 A: so that's what we like to watch the yankees 

579.83 582.41 B: [sigh] i used to watch the cleveland browns all the time 

579.91 580.68 A: on 

582.94 585.99 B: 'cause we're from ohio originally or i am 

585.73 587.37 A: mhm 

587.76 597.83 B: [noise] so you try to watch them and try to watch [noise] as many college games as you can from up there as far as like ohio state goes especially the ohio michigan games 'cause that that's such a big game 

598.05 599.86 B: (( [noise] for them )) 

599.59 599.89 A: (( oh ))
