11.30 15.33 B: oh okay that's still on the eastern seaboard right [laughter] 

14.30 20.71 A: yeah yeah i guess so 'cause i guess you know they have to figure out what time that people are available that's probably the most convenient way to do it 

18.74 20.96 B: right right to match them up right 

21.04 22.99 B: yeah 

21.54 26.52 A: okay well uh t._v. sports well i'm not much of a t._v. person so i'm kind of at a loss 

25.32 33.39 B: [noise] neither am i. [laughter] see neither am i. [noise] with sports it it definitely uh not something i normally would watch on t._v. so 

32.68 33.49 A: (( okay )) 

33.75 40.89 B: unless it's like uh you know the major events where everybody else was watching [noise] then i'm no then i seem to have a slight interest but uh other than 

37.15 38.20 A: right 

39.63 44.24 A: well wh- well what do you think we should do [laughter] 

42.21 49.52 B: [laughter] well what if you did you ever watch anything is there anything that ever comes up with regards to sports that you watch at all 

49.44 52.63 A: uh no not really i'm i'm not much of a 

52.97 58.01 A: like i said i'm not much of a t._v. person so you know um [noise] [laughter] 

58.32 60.72 A: i don't know i don't ve- very watch 

60.87 62.65 A: sports much at all 

62.33 75.30 B: right so when you do watch t._v. sports it's not the thing you're watching is what you're saying correct right right you are my right it's not you know i mean i'll switch the channel and it's i mean the only thing i think i may stop for sometimes is the um the one thing i think is interesting is the olympics 

64.89 66.91 A: no [laughter] exactly 

75.23 76.54 A: right 

75.39 79.95 B: and then not even all of the uh categories uh like the track and field i like [noise] and 

80.23 86.56 B: sometimes there's something on there i've never seen before i may take interest in that but [noise] other than that yeah 

83.76 85.11 A: (( right )) 

85.45 91.67 A: you know i did uh i have watched uh figure skating 'cause um i've got a niece who does that and 

88.52 89.41 B: (( [noise] okay )) 

91.05 91.97 B: (( oh okay )) 

91.71 104.07 A: i've watched her compete in competitions and you know every once in a while uh if there happens to be that on and i happen to be watching t._v. which is kind of an oddity in the two in in itself 

103.81 105.75 B: [laughter] 

104.24 107.42 A: [laughter] 'cause what are the odds of that happening you know 

106.94 108.47 B: right [noise] 

107.79 110.72 A: uh i may wa- sit there and watch it um 

111.12 112.51 A: i guess uh 

112.78 116.42 A: i have seen uh those dog shows 

116.12 117.22 B: (( [noise] oh okay )) 

116.70 122.11 A: in the past and i've enjoyed that 'cause there's i've got two jack russels and 

117.70 118.76 B: (( right [noise] )) 

121.42 122.60 B: (( [noise] oh okay )) 

122.18 127.59 A: they're they're really dear to my heart so -t's kinda neat to see the other dogs 

124.85 126.14 B: [laughter] 

127.39 140.62 B: right right yeah i've those and even sometimes the horse shows but you know i don't stay on them long enough [noise] [noise] but there is actually one thing though that comes to mind but you don't find it often and i happen to like though to watch on t._v. that's a sport and that's i would say the rodeo 

132.76 133.77 A: right 

140.55 141.85 A: (( the rodeo [laughter] )) 

141.65 151.40 B: yeah that's the one thing i don't always like i'm not following it so i know the schedule but i will actually sit and watch the whole [noise] it's usually like an hour i will usually watch that so but that's okay 

148.18 149.09 A: right 

150.19 163.95 A: you know interestingly enough i was listening to n._p._r. uh not too long ago and they were talking that they're in in connecticut closer to where you guys are than where i am there is uh almost an act anachronistic uh society of 

154.45 155.51 B: right 

158.24 159.22 B: (( oh okay )) 

164.30 165.72 A: (( jousters )) 

165.27 166.25 B: (( oh wow )) 

166.14 168.87 A: yeah i and i thought that was really interesting 

168.53 169.59 B: yeah 

168.94 170.98 A: uh and these people there are 

171.43 173.84 A: they do they take it very seriously and they 

173.92 174.93 A: (( they uh )) 

175.16 186.13 A: use get on the horse and and i'm sure a lot of these people are you know trained on being the expert riders 'cause not only do they have to ride the horse they have to carry one of those long toothpicks and uh 

176.88 178.65 B: right 

179.33 180.29 B: right 

185.44 187.59 B: right [laughter] 

186.56 193.08 A: and they spear these little rings that range in size from you know like two inches 

193.09 197.34 A: and then you know the people in the upper categories they they uh [lipsmack] 

197.61 202.08 A: they use rings that are three quarters of an inch that in diameter 

200.56 202.01 B: oh wow 

202.16 203.44 A: (( and i was thinking my )) 

203.50 210.59 A: goodness that is amazing the horse is bouncing up and down you're going forward and you got this big lance that you're holding 

206.02 207.79 B: [noise] yeah right 

210.36 211.32 B: right 

210.63 214.30 A: and they're able they're able to do this and i thought that was a 

212.85 225.78 B: wow but that's it's focus and training that's like even with the in the circus with the high wire that kind of thing you know you have to be so you know it's better to watch it than the participating [laughter] participating in something like that though 

223.27 225.11 A: [laughter] 

225.49 226.50 A: right 

225.92 234.91 B: yeah but that's like i mean most guys that you talk to you find that uh a lot of sports [noise] yeah it takes up uh ninety percent of their time if they do watch t._v. so 

235.40 238.88 B: do you have friends do they watch sports too [noise] or no 

238.78 249.21 A: yeah oh yeah my friends you know uh home most of my male friends watch t- i just i've never just been a very much of a t._v. person i've got too much too many things i'm involved with 

245.11 247.67 B: [noise] right right 

248.65 252.64 B: see that's what i agree with you too is is so many better things that can be done that 

252.39 259.08 A: right i mean i work i work out on a regular basis and i'd rather go do that than stare and veg out [laughter] in front of the t._v. 

252.84 253.87 B: (( you haven't )) 

256.47 257.32 B: oh 

258.49 270.48 B: right yeah i know what you mean i'm so yeah i'd rather do that too i don't do it but i'd [laughter] like that definitely is uh a something better recreational to do i mean the benefits far outweigh than what you're going to see on t._v. 

269.67 271.77 A: exactly exactly 

271.13 273.82 B: oh but yeah you see i d- 

272.65 273.54 A: yeah i'd 

273.99 279.59 A: most often i find uh television kind of insults my intelligence you know [laughter] 

274.18 275.72 B: (( i'm sorry )) 

278.96 279.85 B: right 

279.98 288.93 A: 'cause i mean often times the it's geared toward the most lowest common denominator and i just don't have the patience for it [laughter] 

285.62 286.50 B: right 

287.95 295.32 B: right a lot of stuff no it's true uh when you watch it that's why i'm like just remember what i watch i only like to watch uh specific things i'm just kind of like into discovery 

294.98 296.15 A: right 

295.24 303.46 B: and uh if those kind of things like that forensic stuff i like things of that nature but but you know it's like they say it's just really for entertainment it's not i mean that w- 

298.75 300.05 A: right 

301.27 304.80 A: right right or just or rather diversion [laughter] 

303.97 310.51 B: right exactly [laughter] so i mean but i think of just a lot of people they just have nothing better to do and they say okay 

310.57 311.70 A: right 

310.68 313.86 B: [noise] you know just throw that on [noise] and let the kids watch it yeah 

312.30 313.25 A: mhm 

313.84 325.54 A: now after sometimes after i work out you know a bunch of the guys and i we go out to the um uh our local tavern and get a bite to eat and if the braves are on you know it'll it'll be on the 

322.06 322.90 B: okay 

325.47 338.61 A: the t._v. uh in the bar and we'll just sit there and watch that i mean i'd you know the atlanta braves they were great in the nineties but i i you know i i can't tell you who the players are now i mean i really don't keep up with it 

326.61 327.35 B: (( [noise] )) 

327.39 329.21 B: (( [noise] right )) 

332.84 334.46 B: right [laughter] 

336.12 337.04 B: right 

338.24 345.62 B: what about in type of things related to working out like those uh different types of um mr fitness kind of things or mrs fitness do ever watch any of those things

347.76 348.80 B: oh okay 

348.47 356.22 A: so you know i i pretty and most i i don't think i've ever seen too much stuff about martial arts on television you know i 

353.98 358.25 B: (( yeah televised though yeah i don't think so either yeah that )) 

356.25 364.85 A: i've rented it a couple of a what do you call those ultimate fighting championship kind of things but you know it's i don't know [laughter] it's just 

360.16 361.68 B: right 

363.96 376.43 B: [noise] yeah i wonder why though that's strange i mean it's very popular i've two friends that are are instructors and it's like it's true i mean i hear them go like travel different places and stuff but you it's kind of surprising that you don't see anything televised it seems like a lot of people are interested in it 

376.16 378.07 A: yeah yeah yeah so 

377.12 384.93 B: because maybe not a lot of money 'cause that's what it comes down to right yeah not making any money they don't want to put it on 

379.62 383.41 A: yeah i guess so i guess so [laughter] [laughter] 

384.76 386.64 A: right right right 

386.10 394.08 B: 'cause i know even like with uh cable t._v. it's like more and more a year like maybe ten fifteen different channels now for sport only mhm i'm like wow [noise]
