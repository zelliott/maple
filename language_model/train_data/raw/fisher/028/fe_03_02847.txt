257.76 265.94 A: and then they were calling i think maybe six or seven times a day for like three or four days and then they just quit calling 'cause i was always busy at the times they

284.62 291.49 A: three or four days so and i knew it'd be about something that i have no clue about [laughter] as far as sports go so 

291.75 299.86 A: but it's it's still nice at least you know get to talk to somebody you know nice like yourself and there's a little bit about the topics that makes it a lot easier than 

296.01 297.15 B: (( oh you too )) 

299.76 300.62 B: well it's a 

300.81 303.22 B: experience yeah you get to talk to

357.96 368.43 A: [lipsmack] like i love going to li- this is like probably not quite topic wise [laughter] but they had little like little league games and you know for the little kids i love going to those games 'cause i think they're just so 

368.65 376.79 A: kids are just so adorable as it is but going to those kind of games they're fun and not so serious and [sigh] and uh that kind of thing couple 

375.93 380.06 B: so you don't have kids yourself i assume so but that that's yeah hm oh 

377.83 379.34 A: (( no no i don't no )) 

380.48 382.88 A: but i've worked in daycare and 

382.95 395.65 A: you know kids around the neighborhood always babysitting when i was younger and of course all my brothers and stuff couple of my brothers one of 'em was like in every [laughter] high school sport imaginable he was in soccer and he did um 

383.44 384.22 B: oh 

395.65 404.11 A: a little bit of football that kind of thing and i have another brother who he's sixteen so he did some little bit of the football thing and that's about it but

423.93 430.81 A: yeah like i said i like to go to little league games and little things here and there but nothing big i've never really been into 

431.10 439.59 A: the i think the only team that i ever really watched basketball wise was [laughter] the portland trailblazers and i think that's i have um my grandmother passed away but when she was 

439.81 451.14 A: about in her nineties eighty five ninety she was a big fan of basketball and she loved to watch the blazers she her eyesight was pretty much shot but she loved to listen to 'em and 

451.38 453.08 A: so we kinda bonded on that but 

453.22 458.46 A: [sigh] as far as teams go i think that's about not the only basketball team i think i've ever watched on a regular basis so 

459.52 460.35 B: hm 

461.53 467.75 B: well west virginia there's no basketball team down there is there virginia well that oh i'm thinking professional no

471.78 473.65 A: (( [laughter] i don't even know )) 

473.13 475.20 B: i i don't know co- college at all

489.36 493.96 A: team so that was kind of a a downer 'cause in college you like to go to like football games and

494.74 496.53 A: yeah yeah 

497.71 501.98 A: so [sigh] i don't know i'm kinda run dry on [laughter] sports
