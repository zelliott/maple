432.96 434.19 B: (( yeah okay )) 

435.13 441.73 B: no well back to football [laughter] i j- i'm wondering how much they want us to stay on topic um

448.50 449.70 A: okay who 

450.76 453.35 A: who's your favorite pro team 

454.09 455.10 B: um 

455.23 457.40 B: professionally new york jets um 

457.31 458.31 A: okay 

459.87 461.88 A: i i can't stand 

462.10 465.55 A: well i tolerate the new orleans team so it's 

464.91 466.13 B: really 

465.72 468.24 A: (( yeah you know they suck )) 

467.41 468.33 B: (( hm )) 

468.48 469.53 B: yeah 

469.11 478.81 A: [laughter] yeah and the i'll tell ya my theory behind it new orleans is you know it's a very small place 

478.73 479.72 B: mhm 

479.11 483.72 A: and it doesn't draw the money that the big cities do 

483.00 484.06 B: yeah 

484.13 487.97 A: and i think truthfully that's why they don't let them 

488.25 489.61 A: get anywhere 

489.54 490.60 B: mhm 

489.77 491.35 A: in the play offs 

491.20 492.13 B: yeah 

491.85 496.83 A: 'cause my hu- my husband explained to me that h- 'cause i didn't know all the coaches 

495.48 496.41 B: (( yeah )) 

496.88 498.95 A: share in profits 

498.98 499.88 B: mhm 

499.58 502.15 A: and the better the team [noise] does 

502.31 505.12 A: the more money the coaches get 

504.64 505.53 B: yeah 

505.15 506.99 A: well they don't want 

508.13 509.18 A: (( some )) 

509.61 511.39 A: new orleans team 

511.57 516.41 A: taking money away from them like i mean my favorite team is denver broncos 

513.24 514.64 B: mhm 

516.02 519.33 B: ooh they've a really cute quarterback 

518.74 520.81 A: [laughter] i just 

521.49 528.02 A: i wanna die in colorado [laughter] cost of living is so high up there 

523.50 525.61 B: (( [laughter] greasy yeah )) 

525.70 526.37 B: (( [laughter] )) 

527.88 528.91 B: yeah 

528.77 533.52 A: but it's we've j- we j- we were just big fans we were big elway fans 

533.12 534.10 B: (( hm mhm )) 

533.66 536.81 A: and of course he retired but we still like the team 

535.40 536.59 B: (( yeah )) 

537.38 541.81 A: but all those big teams would lose money if some 

541.93 542.91 A: little 

543.19 545.58 A: new orleans team got into the play offs 

545.41 546.42 B: mhm 

546.21 548.80 A: it would decrease their bottom line 

548.95 549.96 B: yeah 

550.54 554.58 A: and i think i really think that it ultimately it's all about money 

554.71 556.28 B: oh it is it is 

555.79 556.80 A: [laughter] 

556.84 558.15 B: definitely 

557.96 564.16 A: yeah but and that i think that's why we like the college ball so much they haven't gotten that 

558.64 560.37 B: i mean it's such a business 

561.58 571.24 B: mhm [lipsmack] college ball's a lot about money too i mean around here it is yeah we um w._v._u. just cut five sports 

565.59 566.89 A: really 

571.33 574.92 B: uh the rifle team some track and some others 

574.63 575.60 A: gee 

575.57 581.84 B: to pay well we all have this theory about it's actually to pay for the head coach's raise 

581.67 582.31 A: w- 

582.44 584.24 A: oh you're kidding 

582.53 589.59 B: 'cause it it they cut about six hundred thousand from these five sports but then again 

589.84 595.99 B: uh rodriguez's raise was about six hundred thousand dollars a year 

595.59 596.91 A: how convenient 

596.75 599.89 B: yeah i know and oh y- y- the backlash is 

597.54 598.61 A: [laughter]
