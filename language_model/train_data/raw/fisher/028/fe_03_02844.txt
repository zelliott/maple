173.24 174.25 A: i know 

174.74 177.55 A: and the and the seasons are running together too much 

177.59 181.71 B: that's true that's really true 'cause it's already b- baseball 

178.83 179.39 A: (( [mn] )) 

181.40 185.43 A: right well see i had a january baby and we were watching

185.81 196.70 A: the s- super bowl in the hospital and now super bowl's like the end of january if not the first of february you know it just gets later and later and later 

193.54 194.74 B: mhm 

196.08 197.44 B: that's true 

196.99 203.01 A: but i was really surprised the question was as vague i thought it was gonna stay say something about dollars and cents in the 

203.19 217.89 A: in the sports arena you know how ridiculous the money has gotten or or your opinion of the money value of you know right surgeons making nothing compared to these sports figures 

204.67 205.95 B: [lipsmack] oh 

206.87 209.41 B: that could yes that's true 

212.74 214.45 B: towards figures yeah 

216.24 220.81 B: or teachers teachers making very little even out here 

219.44 220.25 A: yeah 

220.86 223.94 B: and they they just and uh i went to 

224.67 228.60 B: i have a degree in um elementary education and i remember 

227.43 228.99 A: see i teach also 

228.75 243.35 B: one of the i ended up home schooling my girls which was not why i went to school but that wasn't god kinda had this whole different plan which was neat but i remember being told that the fourth wall of my classroom was a living room 

233.31 234.18 A: right 

236.86 237.72 A: right 

243.37 246.95 B: in everybody's home and [noise] it was just [noise] 

244.65 245.62 A: right 

247.28 249.17 B: such an eye opening 

250.18 251.79 B: you know comment 

251.42 252.33 A: mhm 

252.10 255.38 B: to feel like you had just so much 

255.44 259.76 B: you know influence and these parents were allowing you to have that in their kids' lives 

259.47 260.34 A: right 

260.31 262.22 B: and so i think teachers are 

262.50 265.47 B: worth their weight in gold most of 'em [laughter] 

264.51 277.29 A: right well and see i t- i north carolina's having problems with that they they want to get teachers in the classroom and then now they're saying they're gonna cut teachers to save the budget and it's like you know make up your mind and then tell us what you're gonna do 

274.06 274.92 B: yeah 

277.05 282.78 B: right that's what we're running into with gray davis and all he's doing he's just such a bad governor 

282.66 283.60 A: right 

282.96 289.31 B: but we're you know when they s- pay sports people so so much money it's such a contrast 

288.72 290.34 A: (( oh i know i know )) 

289.53 292.30 B: so i know when um [lipsmack] 

293.22 304.72 B: you know you see that they're very good and they spend hours and hours on their you know practice and their sport and [mn] just you know honing their skills but it seems kind of out of proportion 

303.50 304.14 A: but 

304.37 306.91 A: well it's a false hope for our own children 

306.83 309.03 B: (( mm mhm )) 

307.29 320.01 A: you know i mean i have a son that's fourteen he and he plays soccer all the time and even though being a teacher he has to do his academics think well you know i really don't have to do this it's like yeah you do have to 

315.51 316.70 B: mhm 

319.70 320.72 B: mhm 

320.23 322.07 A: um how many 

322.20 329.55 A: one out of a billion michael jordan's are there you know it's just ridiculous that the way they've got the fanfare set up with 

324.51 325.64 B: mhm 

329.62 330.86 A: sports 

330.73 335.48 B: we have a a real good friend that was um top 

335.96 344.41 B: [mn] on the soccer team in her high school and she was drafted as a freshman into varsity um [lipsmack] at a local 

337.78 338.74 A: mhm 

341.07 341.93 A: wow 

344.53 349.69 B: a community college and she's very good but she'll never be 

347.42 348.29 A: mhm 

349.16 350.12 A: yeah 

349.71 351.31 B: in the women's soccer 

351.13 351.91 A: (( no )) 

351.40 357.94 B: m- you know world i mean and she's very very good but there are just a handful 

352.90 353.84 A: right 

357.50 359.97 A: right we had a kid several years ago 

360.12 365.85 A: uh josh hamilton that went straight from high school into the pros playing baseball 

365.56 366.73 B: mm 

366.34 378.96 A: and making millions of dollars and and he he rea- when he'd come back home fortunately his parents moved to florida with him to try to keep things under control because an eighteen year old doesn't know what to do with a million dollars 

375.64 376.76 B: mhm 

377.28 379.80 B: oh no oh my gosh 

379.30 388.92 A: when he came back you know some kids said oh josh has this new car and he took me out and we went you know he he picked up the bill for this and this and this and this and it's like you know 

389.19 392.12 A: fine and dandy but that's just not the real world 

391.55 393.44 B: right that's true 

392.20 393.19 A: um 

393.58 397.35 A: and i just think there's a lot of false hope for the teenagers that think 

393.62 394.73 B: that's true 

397.43 399.88 A: oh i'll just make it 

399.65 405.77 B: yeah i'll do the least i can academically and you know then i'll hit it big 

401.42 402.18 A: yeah 

405.39 406.25 A: right 

405.96 407.63 B: and one little injury 

407.70 409.45 A: (( oh i know i know )) 

407.73 419.41 B: and you're out you know the just um the other day uh maybe hm i don't know whatever the last day the lakers played rick fox um [lipsmack] had an injury 

415.98 416.80 A: right 

417.93 421.43 A: [noise] oh he's so nice looking see he's from carolin- u._n._c.

423.57 424.80 B: rick fox 

424.23 425.80 A: i mean rick fox yeah 

425.18 434.08 B: and so he [mn] something showed up i mean he had hurt a something in his foot and now something else is showing up and he might be out for a year 

433.52 435.56 A: hm so he won't come back 

434.26 436.12 B: (( that's a long time )) 

435.88 437.56 A: yeah he won't come back 

437.54 441.52 B: you just think oh my gosh you know sports is just um 

442.46 444.39 B: [lipsmack] kind of a different world 

443.77 447.81 A: right well there's several carolina uh players one got um 

448.39 456.57 A: not that the rest of 'em haven't got caught with hookers but one of 'em kinda messed up his little shiny image he played with michael jordan i can't think of his name 

456.27 457.42 B: (( mm )) 

456.80 458.91 A: worthy uh james worthy 

458.22 459.76 B: oh yeah 

459.14 461.86 A: he was a u._n._c. um guy 

461.75 474.82 B: and you know when you see guys like a. c. green that are so stand up they might not be michael jordan but they're so stand up you just want those kind of guys around your kids you know t- to look at those kinda [mn] you know role models 

466.49 467.37 A: right 

470.40 471.41 A: (( oh i know )) 

474.40 475.22 A: right 

475.04 481.52 B: so um [lipsmack] i know sports is just kind of i guess it's a whole new world so i keep thinking 

481.29 486.90 A: um right and see our the a._c._c. college boys every now and then they'll get in trouble for something stupid like 

486.91 494.85 A: stealing a pizza or years ago it was like stealing underwear or doing something really stupid and they're like you know should they have to be 

490.58 491.71 B: mhm 

495.02 506.99 A: um should their standards be higher than the others and in my opinion they do because they are the role models i mean that's what people and these little young teenagers see is these college boys 

500.00 500.87 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

505.06 505.95 B: yeah 

506.80 507.67 B: yeah 

507.31 517.39 A: like it or not um they are watching them and it's like teachers you know oh teachers never do anything wrong preachers never do anything wrong but then something happens 

514.87 516.29 B: oh [noise] 

516.94 517.87 B: sure 

517.69 520.04 A: you know it's front page

520.36 521.35 A: um 

523.17 525.23 B: it's like a little ripple 

524.94 526.49 A: yes yes 

525.48 532.91 B: you know you drop the pebble in and look how far the ripple goes it doesn't just go to the person you know you took the pizza from 

528.43 529.42 A: oh i know 

532.47 533.95 A: right right 

533.00 535.48 B: you know i mean [noise] and 

535.72 544.48 B: oh somebody said one time well i don't wanna be a role model a sports guy and it was like well i'm sorry it kinda comes with the territory 

539.06 539.93 A: right 

542.41 543.52 A: (( it's too late )) 

543.86 544.79 A: right 

545.00 558.84 A: or i always loved the one that was that was so ridiculous washburn who had such a great future and now that he's in jail for drugs and stuff he played at n._c. state and when he went pros he goes this is too much like work i'm not having fun
