305.53 306.98 B: oh [laughter] 

306.08 314.24 A: he's got this channel changer and you know as soon as they're down on one he switches to other station and he switches around all the time 

311.92 312.84 B: uh-huh 

314.40 316.08 A: so i don't watch it with him 

317.98 322.63 A: so they want to know approximately how much time per week we spend watching sports 

322.77 324.11 B: yeah 

323.07 325.16 A: [noise] what do you figure [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

324.55 326.15 B: (( [laughter] yeah mm )) 

326.44 327.87 B: when i can 

328.50 330.23 B: i would say 

331.87 334.77 B: probably about ten hours 

335.83 338.29 B: (( ten hours if my schedule allows )) 

338.19 339.13 A: yeah 

339.23 340.21 B: (( a week mhm )) 

341.04 344.78 A: yeah that's probably about what i do too depending on what's happening you know if 

345.21 349.21 A: if the bruins are in the playoff i'd be watching those and stuff 

348.81 350.44 B: yeah yes 

349.58 352.83 A: and plus i'd be watching baseball hourly [laughter] 

352.84 356.81 B: uh-huh yeah and the baseball games are getting longer now 

354.50 355.41 A: and when 

356.25 362.15 A: during football season i watch football and i will i watch the patriots [noise] [noise] and i watch the bruins so 

362.43 363.58 A: (( i i i think )) 

364.37 368.70 A: if i i don't i mean i don't usually watch the whole game the um hockey 

368.44 369.64 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

369.08 371.31 A: i kind of switch around with that but 

372.43 376.34 A: i probably spend like ten to fifteen hours a week watching sports 

376.59 382.01 B: uh-huh yeah i know this week is going to be heavy for me because [laughter] the basketball playoffs 

382.15 383.07 A: (( yeah )) 

382.63 387.45 B: and it's two games a night and a game every day this week 

387.23 389.18 A: yeah i'll probably be watching 'em 

389.31 396.02 A: the last maybe the last quarter of those with the celtics in it [laughter] 

393.79 397.03 B: [mn] oh yeah that's it the celtics [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

398.80 407.46 A: i don't watch a i don't watch a whole basketball game i can't stand watching a whole game because that before like i said the if you watch the last five minutes it's a whole game 

408.17 412.17 A: yes that's really [laughter] the last five minutes is the 

412.47 417.29 A: is what counts [laughter] it doesn't matter what you do all before that 

413.91 414.99 B: yeah 

416.70 419.03 B: [laughter] 

417.91 423.16 A: unless it's a blow out you know and even that and i've seen 'em come back to- teams come back from 

424.04 427.99 A: five minutes is like a lifetime in basketball and 

426.28 427.11 B: (( yeah )) 

427.74 429.87 B: yeah it sure is [laughter] 

430.62 437.66 A: i mean you gotta sit down for five minutes thinking you gotta watch the last five minutes and you're there for forty five minutes watching the last five minutes of the game 

430.63 431.63 B: yeah 

437.32 445.93 B: exactly yeah that's what my wife i say i say okay i'll be right with you i got just thirty seconds left in the game [laughter] 

442.98 444.21 A: (( yeah )) 

445.06 446.78 A: (( [laughter] )) 

446.74 451.31 B: twenty minutes later she's coming i thought it was only thirty seconds [laughter] 

451.30 453.48 A: well there's always time now [laughter] 

452.44 454.21 B: [laughter] 

454.97 456.52 B: (( yeah )) 

456.53 462.39 B: but uh it's i i think i watch sports more than i watch anything else 

463.39 467.78 B: 'cause i guess it it it's live and you can't predict it so 

466.64 468.70 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] yeah yeah )) 

468.23 472.15 B: and i think that's the part that that i like about it 

473.25 476.49 A: yeah i'm glad that they chose this topic because it's 

476.64 487.66 A: a they're getting the feeling of how a woman likes sports and a lot of women don't like any sports and i do there are quite a few of them that i like and i like to watch and like to follow 

488.57 491.86 B: um mhm mhm yeah you sound pretty well rounded [laughter] 

491.54 504.51 A: [laughter] yeah like not too many women [laughter] my husband's lucky that i like sport i a- actually i probably like i said like 'em more then he does i probably watch more than he does 

504.70 507.34 A: except for golf he watches more golf than i do 

509.23 511.07 A: i'll watch if his guy's 

511.31 514.93 A: in the top five or something and then i'll watch it 

515.45 520.44 A: but like i said sometimes i'll have it on and he's not even playing 

520.56 524.38 A: and i'll just put it on just to have something on the t._v. 

524.56 535.07 A: and then i'll hear something and i'll go in there and i'll start watching it and i say what am i doing sitting here watching golf who cares [laughter] and 

531.19 532.51 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

533.29 534.90 B: (( mhm yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

536.50 540.76 A: i really don't i really don't care but when it's well what am i doing sitting here watching it [laughter] 

540.11 543.29 B: yeah yeah i find myself 

543.42 546.57 B: you know trying to keep up with you know the leader board 

546.96 550.57 B: and um 'cause i eventually want to start playing it
