215.38 216.25 B: yeah 

217.71 230.88 B: yeah the worst part about being up in here in rochester school is that we don't get the yes network which is all the yankees games now so i have to watch it on line cause i can't like i can't see the game unless e._s._p._n. is covering them 

221.56 222.53 A: uh-huh 

225.06 226.07 A: uh-huh 

227.75 228.98 A: oh 

229.89 233.93 A: yeah you have to watch it over the computer oh goodness 

232.17 233.20 B: yeah 

233.66 235.95 B: yeah i'm not impressed [laughter] 

234.80 237.94 A: how does that work [laughter] 

236.94 246.83 B: it's nice like it is not too bad it's a little delayed so if i'm on the phone with someone that's actually watching the game they're like oh did you see that and i'm like a couple minutes later i'll be like hey that was a great play 

241.65 242.64 A: uh-huh 

245.26 246.08 A: (( isn't )) 

246.29 250.73 A: it kind of dorky um um the few things i've seen i i 

250.85 256.29 A: i use the computer a lot but i haven't used it that in that manner are their movements 

256.37 259.30 A: kind of like an old time movie or something 

258.37 262.85 B: [laughter] yeah it's not yeah it's not as sharp as normal television 

261.26 267.28 A: yeah yeah but if you're you know if you're seeing i can remember my granddaddy was um 

267.74 269.66 A: (( he'd been goodness )) 

269.73 270.47 A: (( um )) 

271.06 274.93 A: he's been dead fifty years but i do remember him um 

275.41 286.45 A: well now he hasn't been dead he's been dead forty years i'm not that old [laughter] but he would listening to it on the radio and and just visualize it and to me that was amazing so you know 

278.27 280.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

286.46 288.58 A: uh that was really neat to 

288.03 289.00 B: yeah 

288.84 294.45 A: think about it and visualizing and being able to to announce for the 

294.53 300.94 A: radio to me something that you know they have to have a special talent to do that i would think c- cause 

296.49 297.59 B: yeah 

301.01 304.60 A: i wouldn't i would not say all the right words i'm sure 

304.34 305.24 B: yeah 

304.72 307.52 A: so people would know what was going on [laughter] 

306.51 319.44 B: it's really fun to practise like turn your t._v. down and as you watch it just call out the game [laughter] [laughter] and like and then it's funny though because after a while i'll watch t._v. now like the coverage of the game and i'll say what they're gonna say a little bit before them 

310.04 312.55 A: [laughter] 

317.94 318.96 A: yeah 

319.24 325.31 A: and the [laughter] [laughter] well that's neat i i um
