114.01 117.29 B: i didn't either i didn't know there was going to be another participant 

116.99 124.59 A: yeah yeah i'm surprised by that too i guess they just record it and then use the um information after that 

118.84 119.68 B: (( mhm )) 

123.88 131.14 B: right yeah but otherwise yeah we do watch you know all kinds of sports i think the only thing we really don't watch is soccer 

131.35 132.52 A: um hm 

132.55 134.57 B: so but 

133.69 138.07 A: yo- you're into the final four then i guess for the basketball 

136.05 137.38 B: oh yes 

137.39 143.17 B: yes my son is into that i'm not but my son and my husband isn't into that either so 

142.77 149.72 A: yeah yeah i guess minnesota's mostly ice hockey and ah winter football winter f- ah 

143.55 144.60 B: yeah 

148.16 156.86 B: oh yeah yep it's really big for that yes yep but otherwise i don't really you know 

157.01 165.89 B: it can get expensive either watching 'em and some of the tickets for these t- games right now they're going on it could be up to three hundred dollars a ticket 

158.92 159.85 A: yeah 

165.79 172.33 A: that's outrageous it's just you can hardly even take a family to a game any more it's just so expensive 

166.62 167.70 B: i know 

170.22 171.33 B: no 

171.90 178.63 B: no the baseball is probably the cheapest that we can go to and we still have outdoor um baseball also 

174.75 176.46 A: yeah yeah 

179.27 190.76 A: did you get a new stadium at all i know a lot of places philadelphia's they're still working on building a new stadium and i notice a lot of the different towns were building new um baseball stadiums 

179.28 180.24 B: so 

190.58 194.86 B: no they're trying to get funding for it but it isn't going over yet 

194.90 196.04 A: oh 

195.42 203.48 B: not at all it's it's too expensive the one we have now is only like ten years old so it really you know i don't think that's that old 

201.62 202.64 A: (( oh )) 

203.32 206.07 A: yeah yeah i agree 

204.48 210.37 B: and people like going to it so i just don't they don't have a good location either for it 

209.52 219.30 A: yeah you know yeah that's what they thought over in philadelphia was the location and then they wanted like separate football separate baseball stadiums you know 

214.68 216.45 B: right 

217.59 231.30 B: yeah right and it depends on who's going to fund it yeah i don't know how the teams can afford it with their ticket prices the way they are either they probably have to raise the ticket price in order to [mn] you know help pay for the new stadiums 

221.01 222.25 A: yeah 

225.66 226.76 A: i know 

231.34 238.74 A: yeah i don't really know what's going to happen ticketwise with all that if they um are going to raise them this year or not i was 

238.09 239.42 B: right 

239.16 242.76 A: (( hoping they wouldn't like 'cause they're high enough as it is )) 

242.05 244.90 B: right are you close to any of your stadiums 

244.93 249.52 A: yeah yeah we're probably about maybe twenty five miles away from 'em 

248.85 253.03 B: oh okay we're closer than that we're like only maybe ten miles 

253.05 254.34 A: oh wow 

253.15 259.63 B: at the most so yeah it's real close here and our hockey one is real close it's like five minutes from my house 

259.47 261.47 A: oh wow that's good 

260.12 266.24 B: i know it's so it's very nice yeah so my kids do have an opportunity to go to 'em and you know 

265.67 275.21 A: that's nice yeah the hockey tickets here in philadelphia you can't can't even buy them unless you buy like in advance like you almost got to do it at the beginning of the season 

266.49 267.66 B: (( yeah )) 

272.05 272.92 B: oh 

274.60 276.72 B: oh my whoa 

275.56 280.45 A: or else be a you know season ticket holder to get into the hockey games 

279.55 287.61 B: oh wow yeah no our tickets are still available every game so that's really good yeah i don't know if the wild win though 

283.67 285.06 A: but that's nice 

287.71 296.86 B: they do go straight into the playoffs next year it will be a d- a real difficult you know to get tickets for each game then it'll probably be just season ticket holders 

293.43 294.65 A: yeah 

296.89 298.54 A: (( yeah you know )) 

297.45 306.33 B: because the price will go up and people just you know once a team gets really popular and good then everybody wants to go watch them 

300.62 301.81 A: yeah 

306.18 314.28 A: yeah well that's even in philadelphia there's so many people that when the team's not that good you still can't get in and like i said it's amazing with hockey 

313.33 314.40 B: oh 

314.49 315.91 A: seeing how it works 

315.24 317.93 B: yeah hockey's a very popular game 

317.64 318.79 A: yeah 

318.08 321.68 B: it is it's growing popular more and more now 

322.02 331.01 A: yeah yeah a lot of um corporations buy in you know buy sections and box seats and boxes and that 

328.29 329.59 B: right 

330.37 335.65 B: yeah and you know and some of those tickets go unsold until like minutes before the game too 

335.16 336.82 A: (( yeah )) 

335.84 344.88 B: you know if you're one of those lucky ones that can just stand there and wait until to the last minute and say do you have any openings and then they do but i don't have that kind of time and 

340.88 342.20 A: yeah [laughter] 

342.69 343.46 A: no 

344.21 353.76 A: time and it's you don't you're not s- guaranteed you know you just sit down there and you have to park spend money to park to stand there and so 

347.23 348.64 B: no you're not 

352.94 356.83 B: that's true yep yeah i know
