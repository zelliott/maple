0.00 0.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

1.82 3.37 A: hello this is arma 

2.97 4.45 B: hi i'm gregory 

4.32 5.19 A: hi 

4.92 5.98 B: how are you 

5.23 12.54 A: uh i'm fine i'm calling from the um kan- um well washington d._c. area but i'm at kansas right now where are you 

12.30 13.85 B: i'm in new york so 

12.98 15.15 A: [noise] oh okay [noise] [noise] 

15.38 17.00 A: so um 

17.10 20.27 A: [noise] what do you think about ter- um bio chemicals 

19.04 22.16 B: (( um bio terrorists they've )) 

23.14 26.96 B: i i wonder [sigh] when they were planning that question in the survey 

27.10 31.01 B: um if they thought of if they had heard about sars yet 

27.81 28.64 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

30.21 32.02 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

31.10 44.45 B: because i'm amused by how or amused isn't the right word um but it's curious to see how much you know something which is not a terrorist attack but just a biological problem can scare people and cause disruption as it is 

43.74 51.18 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] you know you made me think about something i i never looked at it like that um 'cause sars is very dangerous right now and it's spreading 

51.30 53.90 A: [noise] who if it is [noise] [sigh] 

55.31 57.54 A: would it have come from asia 

57.70 60.86 B: uh yeah it looks like it came from china initially 

60.40 61.99 A: oh okay [noise] 

61.79 63.36 B: so i mean 

63.58 64.63 A: (( go ahead i'm sorry )) 

64.45 65.58 B: i'm sorry 

65.01 66.28 A: i'm sorry go ahead 

66.09 73.31 B: uh yes so i mean nobody is at least that i've heard is saying that it's a terrorist thing it seems to be a case where 

73.62 77.64 B: possibly had a virus jump from animals to humans um 

77.06 78.80 A: [noise] [noise] that's kind of hard to do 

79.51 81.22 B: uh for a virus to jump 

80.92 82.66 A: like that yeah 

81.98 89.71 B: uh i think they say that's how aids started actually that it was first a you know monkey virus and that at some point in it infected humans 

89.31 95.22 A: but i i think we were testing it [noise] and that's how the infection came along 

94.37 95.92 B: (( yeah )) 

96.04 104.84 B: but you know it seems like the danger of sars isn't even so much the public health hazard you know it's not ultra deadly 

104.75 105.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-uh [noise] )) 

104.78 111.93 B: um it's what about five percent mortality rate which is obviously scary but it's not like ebola it's not like it kills everybody 

108.79 109.81 A: (( right [noise] )) 

111.64 112.60 A: (( right )) 

112.15 119.51 B: um but the amount of tourism which has disappeared the amount of trade that we sh- has been lost in asia is just gigantic 

115.94 116.78 A: right 

119.10 121.30 A: right that's that's true [noise] 

120.08 121.10 B: so 

121.36 122.26 A: (( and were they [noise] [noise] )) 

121.37 125.68 B: i'm wondering if in the u._s. if there was a terrorist attack like that i 

124.90 125.77 A: well 

125.91 133.30 A: with the attack on september the eleventh it it it makes you see that [noise] they're able to infiltrate 

133.32 135.29 A: any area that they want 

135.83 139.14 A: uh so that's scary [noise] um [noise] 

138.54 143.51 B: yeah and i guess that nine eleven attack is a parallel case right i mean you've 

142.54 143.39 A: right 

143.56 144.94 A: [noise] 

144.07 148.02 B: you you destroyed just two buildings but you have made such a huge impact 

147.89 149.20 A: (( well [noise] [noise] )) 

148.50 150.87 B: that's out of all proportion to the 

150.31 152.21 A: (( would the that that [noise] )) 

152.75 166.31 A: that's really it well it was four incidents but it's only four incidents of what we know of [noise] [noise] ho- how if there were more attacks planned [noise] but we reacted quicker than they expected [noise] 

158.05 159.06 B: (( what right )) 

166.27 174.06 A: and that stopped further attacks because you you've got the plane in pennsylvania and you got the plane up um 

174.30 177.35 B: at the pentagon yeah that's true [noise] [noise] [noise] 

174.59 175.84 A: [noise] at the pentagon 

176.69 185.29 A: [noise] um there actually could have been other sites availab- um that were available to them [noise] because we have a lot of foreigners over here um [noise] 

185.98 193.21 A: and like they say they're cells they're implanted they've been here for [noise] for years they've trained for this [noise] 

191.03 192.34 B: for years yep 

193.40 194.34 A: um 

194.54 198.13 A: (( the or you can cal- you call 'em spies that's just what you call 'em )) 

197.71 199.17 B: [noise] i'm sorry 

198.57 200.76 A: they're spies that's all they are 

201.11 203.33 A: [noise] um and and they wait for [noise] 

203.52 204.98 A: opportunity 

204.64 206.01 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

205.73 212.96 A: um because it's nine eleven they would have never dawned on me to do it on september the eleventh would it have you 

214.37 215.61 B: ha- what do you mean 

215.37 222.80 A: [noise] it would have not never dawned on me to attack on september the eleventh using our emergency system in itself 

221.75 222.50 B: (( yes )) 

223.35 225.42 A: um so that 

225.48 232.40 A: biological with everything that's go- that's going on right now in iraq they're looking for biological weapons [noise] 

231.21 233.06 B: mm yes they are 

232.52 234.37 A: and they do have them 

234.54 236.93 A: um we're j- retired military 

237.07 238.03 A: um 

238.29 241.48 A: well my son is actually a retired military 

241.25 242.05 B: oh 

241.65 244.72 A: and [noise] he did the first desert storm 

244.77 248.41 A: and he came back with pictures of such devastation [noise] of 

248.43 253.91 A: what w- what happened to people [noise] there were mass graves and look at how they found all those [noise] 

254.01 257.87 A: uh people in coffins at an airport i think it was 

258.07 263.10 B: yeah from previous wars or previous atrocities yeah 

261.52 262.36 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

262.53 267.86 A: right right so evidently they were their human guinea pigs or something 

267.65 268.34 B: (( yes )) 

268.34 273.39 A: um there are weapons there we probably will never find all of them [noise] 

273.53 283.72 A: but the big thing was to get [noise] the regime out of power i think and i think it's more say if we if you don't find mass weapons of destruction you were wrong 

283.78 285.94 A: [noise] it people need freedom 

286.70 301.24 A: [noise] that's how i look at it and that's what an at- a biological attack on us that's what it would do to us [noise] it would take away our freedom and [noise] because what nine what what happened with nine eleven you did take away a lot of our freedoms and our rights [noise] 

300.62 304.12 B: yeah i mean look at the searches in the airports [laughter] 

303.23 307.33 A: oh god i know i'm about to get on a plane this afternoon 

307.08 308.12 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

307.57 310.99 A: and i mean to take your shoes off too 

311.50 316.95 A: everything has to be searched um [noise] from the smallest item to the largest item 

317.31 318.31 A: um 

318.70 322.01 A: we ordinary citizens are suffering from this 

320.90 321.66 B: yeah 

322.57 323.60 A: (( [noise] w- [noise] )) 

322.77 334.20 B: and again it's not a- again it's what i'm saying it's not so much the attacks themselves or with the anthrax um scare they killed i think a total of what six people i think five or six people 

329.05 329.96 A: right 

330.02 330.92 A: (( uh-uh )) 

332.49 333.51 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

333.72 334.89 A: yeah 

334.18 340.94 B: but the u._s. mail the u._s. government is spending billions of dollars trying to anthrax proof the postal facilities though 

340.52 342.63 A: [noise] which you can never do [noise] [noise] 

342.00 344.21 B: yeah which seems 

344.54 347.19 B: a an impossible task exactly 

346.63 349.65 A: my husband has um gulf war syndrome 

350.40 360.20 A: [lipsmack] the illnesses and they're trying to decipher what it is it might be years before they say okay you actually were exposed to something we're gonna compensate you for it 

350.65 352.94 B: (( mm )) 

359.63 362.32 B: was he also over there in desert storm oh 

361.71 372.39 A: yes he was over there at the original desert storm um with all of that that happened we lost a child um we lost well we actually lost three children trying to have three children during that period 

372.14 373.46 B: (( oh i'm sorry [mn] yes )) 

372.40 381.67 A: um from when he retired and i- it was heartbreaking and now they- they're even asking him questions on that to see if that was a link 

381.98 382.83 A: um 

382.84 385.52 A: [noise] and i i really feel it was a link [noise] 

385.92 397.06 A: um in some kind of way it you know i me- messed up one of his his his sperm [noise] genes [noise] something went wrong because i've never had problems having children before 

391.74 393.01 B: (( right yeah [mn] ))

424.45 425.74 A: (( [noise] desert storm )) 

426.35 428.78 A: that they were to guess may i say 

429.82 431.66 A: they did everything they could 

431.18 432.16 B: (( yeah [mn] [sigh] )) 

431.95 436.63 A: he he had sores on the back of his head [noise] he has headaches a lot 

436.70 439.44 A: uh weakness in his muscles and joints 

440.11 445.91 A: he he's not as active and as mobile [noise] so he literally had to retire 

445.95 451.65 A: he wasn't ready for it but he he wasn't as agile as they need him for the military 

451.13 452.07 B: right

477.17 477.74 A: (( [noise] ))

516.03 520.02 A: i don't mind it [noise] because it's for my freedom and my safety 

520.76 526.63 B: [sigh] i guess the question becomes how much can you protect your freedom before all the precautions themselves are
