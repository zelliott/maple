39.15 41.72 B: i know ain't that funny i know i wish we could 

40.34 43.72 A: but we should probably get to the topic right 

42.69 50.96 B: yes yes [mn] i guess [laughter] bioterrorism hm [laughter] well y- let's since you live in new york [laughter] how uh 

44.31 46.82 A: [laughter] um 

47.18 48.52 A: [laughter] 

50.13 54.06 A: well i don't think there's very much that they can do i mean 

53.27 54.92 B: (( they can't no )) 

54.25 61.05 A: this i mean anybody can walk in any anywhere with a suitcase or you know aren't those little chemicals really small 

61.20 71.58 B: yeah yeah i mean i read something a while back ago that said it y- they had to use a lot of it to really make a big big you know make it a big problem 

71.07 80.97 A: i heard that too like they could do it in an enclosed subway or a small bus or building or room but like the whole city i don't think they can do that 

76.10 77.03 B: right 

78.95 80.47 B: yeah that would be 

80.52 85.38 B: i don't think i don't think they have the capacity of doing that i mean it's 

85.47 95.86 B: 'cause what i read was from a um retired oh it says a general or something and he had been around that kind of stuff and he said soldiers were the most at risk because they're the ones that are 

95.68 104.49 B: you know right there if it happened he said that he he says just there's they've gotta use so much and a lot of it is the kind that you can 

97.36 98.14 A: (( [noise] right )) 

101.69 102.72 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

104.39 111.02 B: um if you just he said it he said the best way to protect yourself is just if you hear something like a loud pop or you 

110.88 123.39 B: see people screaming and hollering running you know he said just get to higher ground and breathe better air and he said a lot of it can be washed off or it's just a matter of getting to better air he said that's pretty much it i mean you 

110.96 111.73 A: uh-huh 

123.20 127.48 B: don't have to panic he said that's the best way you're gonna survive if you don't panic you know 

127.04 130.08 A: so like go up to the roof or 

129.44 135.78 B: yeah well you know especially if you're in a subway you know just try to get out as quickly as you can to get fresh air you know 

133.57 134.38 A: yeah 

135.65 145.28 B: and um that he- that's what he said now something like small pox i don't know i mean that that's kinda one person could come over here with small pox and 

144.93 147.08 A: (( aren't there vaccinations out there )) 

147.45 148.35 B: (( [sigh] )) 

147.73 149.62 A: i don't know anything about that 

148.99 153.29 B: the vaccination i mean they've got 'em but they're not giving them to us yet i mean 

152.15 156.64 A: [noise] oh right it's available to isn't it available to people in army and government 

156.15 169.13 B: well government and medical people i think um you know just so they would be protected i mean i think they could make 'em pretty quick if w- it was you know started an epidemic but i think it's something that um 

157.75 158.66 A: yeah 

165.86 166.71 A: right 

169.13 179.69 B: i don't know small pox is highly highly it's just a i- the thing about it's contagious so contagious i think it's worse than w- it would be be with sars i mean it's like 

178.33 179.29 A: mhm 

179.83 189.90 B: if you just get breathed on with [laughter] small pox i mean you're in trouble so that would just be somebody wanting to be a suicide person and have it and come over here on a plane or 

183.66 184.32 A: (( mm )) 

188.58 189.23 A: (( mm )) 

189.74 190.63 A: yeah 

189.96 193.07 B: you know and just start coughing on everybody but 

192.02 202.14 A: i mean once in a while i do worry about it and i was in new york for september eleventh and i was really paranoid and i bought i wanted to i was looking all over for masks someone was buying masks and suits 

197.19 197.91 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

201.44 202.81 B: oh yeah 

202.17 204.32 A: but nothing happened and 

203.74 204.79 B: (( n._o. )) 

204.39 205.22 A: i mean 

205.36 207.98 A: i don't i don't worry about it 

207.37 218.30 B: no i think we're trying to take care of it i mean i think that everybody you know everybody is so alert right now i just i can't imagine especially new york i cannot imagine 

213.45 214.42 A: yeah 

218.37 219.40 B: um 

219.80 224.48 B: [lipsmack] them really getting away with anything [laughter] i mean as much stuff as 

224.73 231.96 B: you know the the people that they have looking and trying to protect y'all and everything i mean it's uh i can't imagine 

229.27 230.23 A: yeah 

231.00 233.42 A: you know it could happen anywhere i mean [mn] 

232.80 235.56 B: it can yeah i don't i don't wo- 

234.40 236.23 A: i've never heard of it happening 

236.11 245.09 B: no and i don't worry about it as much where i'm at 'cause i'm in just a little uh i'm in tyler's a good little sized city but it's not like dallas or 

243.39 244.12 A: mhm 

245.21 247.34 B: houston in um 

246.80 251.01 A: it would hit london and new york or san francisco l._a. big cities 

250.46 252.18 B: oh yeah oh yeah 

251.15 252.60 A: i don't think they even 

253.51 256.22 B: yeah they would that that's where they would try to 

256.23 266.16 B: to major majorly get you know and now unless they if they hit us again like they did september eleventh i mean i think were intending that day to do a lot more damage than what they did 

265.60 266.72 A: oh you think so 

266.44 275.50 B: oh i think so i think they were surprised that um we got all the planes out of the air i mean i really think that's when we shut down the whole [cough] 

267.28 268.02 A: uh-huh 

275.43 281.69 B: sky i mean they're like whoa i mean because i think they had other planes probably planning on hitting other places 

276.61 277.72 A: oh yeah 

281.17 286.16 A: [mn] i heard rumors that they were gonna destroy some of the bridges in california that never happened 

285.62 295.39 B: no it didn't because we acted so fast which and i don't think they've ever shut down all air space i mean i that's the first time ever but 

288.88 289.76 A: (( yeah )) 

292.16 292.99 A: right 

294.95 298.78 A: that's interesting i never heard that theory that they had more 

297.37 298.33 B: (( well i think )) 

298.36 306.38 B: i think they would have because that day i mean i i i just remember thinking you know after the first two towers were hit i thought 

306.32 309.68 B: okay and then and then they said the pentagon and then the 

309.48 322.32 B: you know and i thought oh my lord there are places just start hitting everywhere i mean that's just kind of scary because [sigh] you know 'cause four four places i mean that was i i think i mean that's just my opinion i think they probably had other targets 

312.08 313.06 A: yeah 

320.39 321.38 A: yeah 

322.17 327.35 B: but they got taken out of the air really quick before they could've done anything but um 

323.81 324.61 A: uh-huh 

327.15 336.19 A: i don't think there's any way to prevent bioterrorism terrorism at all because it i- i ju- i don't know very much about it but i think it could be in a suitcase or a pocket or a briefcase 

327.38 327.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

335.68 336.68 B: it could 

336.11 342.22 A: i don't think there's any way unless they you know have some way of to detect it like a carbon monoxide tester 

337.51 338.63 B: yeah 

341.85 343.33 B: well i think they 

342.51 345.54 A: i i don't think there's anything anyone can do 

345.30 349.91 B: no i don't i think that yeah i think you're right i mean they i think they um 

349.97 353.53 B: could detect it maybe especially going on a plane 

353.15 354.20 A: mhm 

353.58 362.49 B: or m- you know stuff like that but i just can't imagine just being walking into a hotel or something and i mean they can't [sigh] there's no way 

362.28 367.07 A: because they're hidden anywhere and they're they obviously you know 

363.88 365.54 B: oh yeah oh yeah 

366.99 367.89 B: well see 

367.09 368.56 A: try to hide it [mn] 

368.32 376.91 B: well the like that general said if you ever hear a loud pop or something he said look around and see if people are like rubbing their eyes or um 

372.26 373.14 A: mhm 

375.58 376.40 A: mhm 

377.05 379.90 B: uh things like that he said um 

380.15 388.01 B: um now air filtration systems is where i would think that would be the easiest to be able to put stuff in but they may must have had big 

388.47 398.00 B: to do that you must yeah you must have to have a big thing i mean so i would think that'd be obvious [laughter] you know to people be like what are you doing [laughter] you know putting it into the 

389.26 391.00 A: like a tank or something 

394.02 394.95 A: yeah 

397.83 404.19 B: air filtration system [laughter] well the crop dusting thing was probably one of the things they were thinking 

398.94 399.97 A: yeah 

403.74 404.90 A: yeah 

404.28 410.44 B: that would probably if they could spread something like anthrax probably you know that might be easy 

408.88 413.02 A: i don't think any crop duster is gonna be allowed over the skyline 

411.68 413.91 B: (( i know no i )) 

413.93 416.27 B: (( don't think so [laughter] )) 

415.37 422.83 A: i guess when i was worried about it um i guess i thought that they could like hit a whole city very easily but 

422.66 425.14 B: i i just don't think they know 

423.81 426.39 A: i think it's the small areas 

426.26 434.78 B: yeah and they even saddam hussein with his bioterror you know bioterrorism thing i mean i really wonder if 

434.90 443.66 B: if i don't know how they could have attacked us with that i mean unless he just they're worried that they might just send people over and try to do things like 

443.87 454.50 B: like how nine eleven happened i mean have people set everywhere and do it all at the same time or but see now we're just so on alert that i just i don't think they can get away with anything 

449.30 450.03 A: mhm 

454.00 459.13 A: but i think those u._n. weapons expect inspectors they found a lot of evidence of 

458.56 460.55 B: oh i think so too and i think 

459.55 465.17 A: and they probably took them and destroyed them i don't follow the news that closely but i you know did did hear 

465.29 467.91 A: you know here and there that they found things 

467.60 469.46 B: the u._n.'s inspect- 

468.83 470.99 A: inspectors in iran 

469.87 471.07 B: they found stuff 

471.49 473.93 A: well they found like 

474.21 485.42 A: i don't exactly 'cause i i'm not a news person you know i just kind of turn it on every once in a while and [noise] they did find like evidence of things maybe from the past or 

478.29 479.45 B: yeah 

484.80 498.48 B: well i knew uh yeah i knew they had found some evidence and that's why i'm really hoping that they end up finding some stuff now um you know because uh i hope so we'll at least have a little reckoning on doing the war but um 

490.59 491.92 A: mhm 

498.72 501.25 B: for their sake [laughter] um 

501.44 505.90 B: but [sigh] i i don't know uh that's interesting i 

506.50 514.26 B: i would think if they found a whole bunch or if they really found one they wouldn't have hidden that but i don't think they would of i think they would of told everybody 

513.68 519.51 A: oh you mean you don't think they really found anything i guess i'm just kinda paraphrasing it yeah 

516.08 524.08 B: oh i they i think they found evidence for sure and i think we've found evidence right now but they're testing everything to see 

524.51 530.69 B: if it really is what they think it is and and all that good stuff but um 

527.23 528.15 A: mhm 

530.92 535.22 B: i don't know it's just scary it's a scary world really [laughter] [noise] 

534.22 537.40 A: it is a scary world and i think everyone 

535.32 536.77 B: [laughter] 

537.59 541.07 A: in generally hates the united states because we go over there and h- 

541.18 544.33 A: you know with soldiers and boats and tanks and 

543.73 552.05 B: yeah yeah i uh i hate i hated that we had to do that but i think saddam hussein needed to be stopped somehow 

551.95 553.13 A: yeah 

552.59 563.67 B: i mean i'm glad we took charge of it i mean i wish we'd a had backing but uh you know we don't i don't know everything that that has is going on you know and it's like if [noise] 

563.77 575.48 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] i i'm glad that we just didn't hurt as many people as it could have happened you know i'm just glad i- the war is getting to be over with and we didn't lose very many people and 

568.03 568.86 A: (( yeah )) 

572.06 572.91 A: mhm 

575.30 582.13 B: and i don't think they lost as many people as we could have you know um and i hope that they or [lipsmack] 

579.11 579.88 A: uh-huh 

582.14 591.90 B: i don't know i hope they're happier with it and um with what happened i don't know i can't really tell what their [laughter] reaction is to this right now [laughter] 

584.31 585.48 A: yeah 

591.08 592.81 A: i don't really think 

593.27 595.55 A: there's just going to be bioterrorism 

595.58 596.41 B: mm 

596.45 598.78 A: because it hasn't really happened yet 

598.20 599.95 B: no if it i think if they were
