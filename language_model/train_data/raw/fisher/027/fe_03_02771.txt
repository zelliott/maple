195.27 196.03 A: mhm 

195.38 204.56 B: uh and and the irony behind it is that the network that that he was gonna place it on was not available to any residents in the bronx which is where the yankees play 

204.27 205.74 A: [laughter] 

204.70 208.86 B: and uh you know that got some uh some customers a little upset 

208.89 221.05 B: and they had some uh cable wars [laughter] uh just uh some little trouble here and there but i think they actually settled things down actually uh i think cleared things up so now everyone uh 

211.52 212.70 A: i bet 

221.04 224.04 B: can watch yankee games again [laughter] 

222.92 226.70 A: well that's that'd be good you know that would that wouldn't be yes 

224.75 233.31 B: that'd be that would suck imagine you're an avid yankee fan and now you don't get to watch it on t._v. you can only see it live it's like how many people really have season tickets 

228.89 230.19 A: exactly 

230.59 231.82 A: yeah that would 

233.00 244.58 A: all right that wouldn't be very good huh [laughter] yeah i d- can't i don't even know anybody with season tickets to anything [laughter] anything well we're kinda out in the boondocks so

253.39 255.49 A: yeah oh golly 

254.23 255.25 B: uh 

255.40 267.79 B: i mean it's it's hard enough to watch every game on t._v. imagine uh trying to go to every game [laughter] i mean i'm still like like twenty thirty minutes from from the game from whatever yankee stadium so 

260.71 262.00 A: right 

266.18 267.44 A: yeah 

267.91 273.28 B: there's nothing like watching it on the t._v. i i get to you know flip a channel and it's there or i get to go to a local bar
