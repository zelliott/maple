30.42 36.03 B: they're good enough i mean what what could you possibly do you can't prevent people from coming in 

35.66 45.72 A: no and we're doing all we can in in iraq to look for what we suspect is uh is around there that they might use 

45.94 50.91 A: but that's just iraq i mean they're suspecting that stuff is hidden in syria what can we do 

50.97 54.28 B: and i mean people probably already here 

54.29 56.80 B: that might possibly do something 

57.38 60.23 A: well that's you know that's possible but uh 

60.41 64.29 A: but the supplies could be here and the people could be coming over 

64.46 65.29 B: right 

65.40 67.21 A: that's uh it's really a 

67.95 71.68 A: i think it's a dilemma that our government is probably pondering 

71.88 73.11 A: at this time 

73.46 74.94 B: very scary 

74.35 76.01 A: yeah it is very scary 

75.10 79.04 B: especially well you you realise you live in new york city 

78.34 80.16 A: yeah yeah 

79.45 87.04 B: especially for you i take the subway and i don't know if you travel by subway it's very scary [laughter] 

85.61 90.95 A: yeah i do but rarely rarely i usually go by bus or i walk i walk a lot 

91.12 95.47 A: but i mean this thing with sars now is so incredible 

95.24 98.89 B: it is i've seen people walk around with a mask on 

98.52 102.85 A: yea- the japanese do that a lot and they do that normally in their culture 

104.45 111.02 A: i w- i asked my brother who's a doctor what one could do like i i frequently go to canada because i have aunt there 

111.37 116.53 A: and i asked him if i if i fly or if i go bus i'm still in mass transportation 

116.91 118.93 A: and what can i do to protect myself 

118.94 122.05 A: and he thought that a uh a good surgical mask 

122.07 123.99 A: would be all i could do 

123.67 126.09 B: [noise] if it's worn properly as well 

125.79 126.76 A: yeah 

127.20 128.53 B: (( it's very scary )) 

127.27 131.66 A: but i've seen those surgical masks all they do is kind of pinch the top of your nose 

131.14 134.63 B: right yeah i wear them sometimes at work i'm a therapist 

134.05 134.96 A: (( ah )) 

134.72 138.04 B: and sometimes i work with uh patients who are in comas 

138.29 139.94 B: and we have to wear them 

139.46 140.49 A: yeah 

140.52 143.32 B: i don't know if i would feel a hundred percent 

143.39 144.25 B: safe 

143.90 149.36 A: yeah i have a girlfriend in canada and i said i don't think i wanna come until this whole thing blows over 

149.39 154.51 A: and she said that the whole thing is actually yellow journalism she said it's not as bad as it sounds 

154.50 155.55 B: really 

154.96 156.29 A: she goes everywhere 

156.58 163.76 A: she goes to eat in chinese restaurants uh she goes to movies and takes uh public transportation 

163.72 169.21 B: well are are we supposed to live in fear i mean we could walk out the door and get hit by a bus or 

166.31 167.22 A: no 

168.35 169.22 A: yeah 

169.50 171.24 A: this is absolutely true 

172.52 173.42 A: so 

172.74 174.85 B: you know it it is scary though 

174.08 177.86 A: yeah yeah you remember what happened in japan that time in the subway 

177.42 178.88 B: right right 

178.08 179.73 A: (( that that was terrifying )) 

179.31 181.80 B: was that that was in was that in tokyo 

181.13 183.03 A: i think it was tokyo yes 

183.92 186.29 B: [mn] did did they say what that was 

186.52 189.01 B: i don't remember exactly what that was 

188.31 193.40 A: i don't recall either but it was some kind of terrible germ that killed a lot of people 

193.22 197.91 B: was it a mustard gas or something not not that that it matters [laughter] 

194.95 196.47 A: i don't remember 

196.91 199.81 A: no no i don't remember i do not remember 

200.28 203.55 A: and the idea is with with bioterrorism they could 

204.37 206.28 A: do put it in our water 

206.54 210.30 A: i mean they don't necessarily have to explode a bomb somewhere um 

209.72 210.62 B: right 

210.96 213.70 A: it could infiltrate um 

213.96 216.44 A: oh the whole subject is really sickening 

216.22 218.42 B: (( scary that's why i )) 

216.92 218.00 A: yeah 

218.48 222.80 B: tend to stay away from the news and the newspaper because if it mm 

222.27 223.34 A: yeah 

224.86 225.96 A: so 

226.76 230.14 A: what else do we talk about [laughter] 

229.09 231.44 B: what about smallpox [laughter] 

231.15 239.25 A: oh god you know i have i have a sugg- i was vaccinated against smallpox when i was a child i don't know if you were 'cause i wasn't born in this country 

238.60 239.90 B: no i wasn't 

239.71 244.92 A: but i have the certificate still from my smallpox uh vaccination 

245.95 247.97 B: will that still be viable i don't 

247.38 248.84 A: i don't think so 

248.00 249.39 B: yeah you're probably 

249.46 258.15 B: that that's scary too that they eradicated this disease and all of a sudden they're saying that russia have given it to 

251.10 252.02 A: yeah 

258.27 259.88 B: iraq and 

260.43 261.96 B: really scary 

261.13 267.42 A: what could they have been thinking i mean was it just a financial advantage that they sold something and got money for it 

266.85 268.37 B: i'm sure it was i'm 

268.57 269.86 B: sure it was 

269.30 270.06 A: oh 

269.90 272.32 B: that that's what it all boils down to 

272.37 284.99 A: you know i i read something else recently not long ago that uh somewhere in the in the bowels of some laboratories there are disease germs that have been become extinct 

285.33 290.63 A: but they're still alive in these laboratory settings 

290.72 293.29 A: and they're wondering whether they should kill them 

293.33 304.23 A: and they're treating it as if it were an organism that's of value on some level or another when in fact if these things got loose it would be like a plague 

303.97 304.82 B: but 

304.88 309.80 B: but then again it might be valuable in that it might help to find a cure 

309.35 311.52 A: like an anti venom thing 

310.40 311.56 B: right 

312.47 314.79 B: if they don't have access to it 

312.50 313.44 A: (( i don't know )) 

314.33 315.77 A: yeah 

315.03 316.89 B: they might not be able to 

317.03 318.32 B: get a cure 

317.88 318.88 A: yeah 

318.55 321.48 B: god forbid it ever does come back 

322.38 329.78 A: yeah well there aren't many of things around anymore i mean there's there's plague in some places in the world 

326.69 328.56 B: that we know of mhm 

330.04 333.30 A: there's like uh i guess it's like bubonic plague 

333.41 336.61 A: the thing that practically wiped out all of europe at one time 

337.66 338.34 A: (( oh )) 

338.76 340.06 B: very scary 

339.51 341.22 A: it is it really is 

341.93 350.05 B: it's scary that in this day and age that you think you know with all of our disease prevention and all of our knowledge 

350.89 354.27 B: and it's scary that this could actually happen 

353.71 354.52 A: yeah 

354.78 361.92 A: and i don't know how well we're doing in conquering the diseases that are already prevalent i mean look at cancer look at aids 

362.19 366.38 A: i i don't hear of anything that's come along of late 

366.76 370.79 A: that's promising any kind of cure or help 

372.59 373.65 B: true [lipsmack] 

373.05 377.06 A: i've had two friends die of leukemia two adult friends 

376.65 377.45 B: (( oh )) 

377.21 379.55 A: i mean you know it's like nothing 

379.73 381.06 B: terrible 

380.52 381.68 A: yeah 

383.54 384.91 A: and it doesn't stop 

385.84 396.67 B: but i wonder if that's a societal cause like especially when it's in clusters like in long island the high incidents of breast cancer and 

397.20 398.26 A: you are 

397.29 401.65 B: i think there's a lot that our our government knows that they don't tell us 

401.10 406.25 A: mm you think like contamination of certain kinds like the water table or 

403.65 405.23 B: right exactly 

406.78 407.58 B: right 

407.14 409.00 A: or plants that grow there 

407.96 410.11 B: plants mhm exactly 

409.65 410.55 A: (( mm )) 

410.94 412.82 B: there's something going on of 

413.09 416.85 A: you think that the government does know things that they're not sharing 

415.84 417.79 B: course of course 

418.08 423.05 A: which would do what in the event that it were disseminated 

423.23 424.40 B: (( i don't know )) 

423.36 427.50 A: pe- i mean people would move or they'd protest or sue 

428.19 429.44 B: probably 

430.42 435.33 B: i i think they're scared they they know they know that this is out there and 

432.04 432.78 A: mm 

435.86 440.02 B: they're they're covering up to cover themselves basically 

438.61 441.79 A: [noise] yeah yeah 

442.00 442.77 A: well 

444.24 446.49 B: it's a real scary topic to think of 

446.00 450.40 A: it really is i wonder how they derive their topics i i heard they have forty topics 

450.69 452.62 A: how did you find out about this by the way 

452.08 457.19 B: oh um a friend of mine told me i also saw it in the village voice afterward 

456.58 460.30 A: that's where i saw it and i've been telling friends of mine 

461.62 463.60 B: is this your first time calling 

462.95 465.79 A: no this is my second i actually initiated this one 

466.21 467.64 B: yeah me too [laughter] 

466.29 471.00 A: my regular night is monday night but i'm going to canada on tuesday 

470.62 472.02 B: oh good luck 

471.70 474.49 A: uh i'm going to new brunswick and nowhere near toronto 

475.21 481.10 B: uh now they have the higher incidents of death rate for sars don't they in canada 

480.66 482.94 A: in toronto yes 

482.50 483.38 B: (( mm )) 

483.45 485.81 A: and it's apparently uh 

486.04 488.10 A: clustered in their chinatown 

488.21 491.72 A: which isn't far from where my girlfriends lives 

488.32 489.34 B: wow 

491.83 493.73 B: oh that's scary 

493.13 497.37 A: yeah but i'm going to new brunswick it's a it's a pleasure trip uh 

497.56 501.19 A: a motoring trip we're hoping that the weather will be nice 

500.82 502.62 B: i hope so too [laughter] 

501.64 503.28 A: 'cause it's pretty cold up there 

503.57 506.85 A: we're going to the bay of fundy have you ever heard of that 

505.36 507.73 B: wow no i haven't 

507.31 514.41 A: it's an area where the tides are the highest of any place in the entire world the tides swell forty feet 

514.21 515.28 B: (( wow )) 

514.83 516.27 A: in a cycle 

516.83 519.69 A: and it it sounds very thrilling 

520.63 522.29 A: so that's where i'm going 

522.30 523.16 A: tuesday 

522.93 527.00 B: just try not to think about this topic [laughter] i 

525.36 527.35 A: yeah really really 

528.09 535.68 B: mean it's it's scary like like i said when i go on the subway and like it's like sometimes i have almost an anxiety attack thinking about this 

534.31 536.78 A: mm yeah i 

535.95 539.82 B: so i have to stop myself from watching the news and listening to 

539.36 546.41 A: yeah i i feel the same way when somebody sneezes next to me i suddenly become very aware that they've sneezed 

542.39 543.06 B: (( it )) 

545.25 546.15 B: right 

546.23 547.10 B: right 

547.31 552.93 A: but you know um it's not only the subway if you belong to a health club like i belong to the uh bally's 

553.01 565.16 A: and bally's has taken over where the vertical club was so it's it's just like a storefront street level but then you go down three levels below the ground you're breathing recycled air 

564.55 565.78 B: right 

565.09 572.91 A: in any situation where you're breathing recycled air you're very vulnerable to whatever anybody has breathed into that air 

573.82 575.66 A: so it's not just the subway 

575.89 580.12 A: it's a lot of different venues that you might find yourself in 

580.49 582.66 B: scary way to think too 

581.91 585.19 A: it really is i like do you ever go to malls or 

584.31 586.09 B: yeah all the time 

585.73 587.60 A: oh indoor malls 

586.94 587.96 B: yes 

587.93 589.60 A: that's recycled air 

588.95 589.90 B: mhm 

590.78 592.21 A: (( yuk )) 

593.06 595.07 A: so what can we do to protect ourselves 

595.18 599.45 B: i don't know i i just i don't want to become like a hypochondriac 

598.73 599.63 A: no
