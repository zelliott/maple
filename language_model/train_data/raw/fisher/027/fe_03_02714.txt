68.78 75.00 A: yep but uh d- do you feel what do you feel like the u._s. can do to prevent things like this 

75.03 79.82 A: i mean i mean 'cause obviously i don't feel like the u._n. stands behind anything 

79.88 81.63 A: like that that's done [cough] 

82.50 88.77 B: yeah there's uh i mean you can you can try to prevent it all you want but if 

83.36 84.16 A: (( mhm )) 

86.99 87.77 A: mhm 

88.99 94.04 B: they're determined to do it then they're gonna find a way you know to do it 

94.24 98.22 B: and uh i- it's really tough because and you can 

98.31 111.79 B: you can say oh we're going to you know have these talks and we're going to provide them aid and all this other stuff but and the bottom line is that you know it's it's up to them you know and it's up to 

112.24 116.09 B: you know their country what they what they feel that they have to do 

116.35 123.26 B: you know i feel just you know continue with the diplomatic talks and everything and you know it doesn't anything it could help 

123.87 132.74 A: yeah well so far [laughter] new indications that it's been happening all along i mean one that the u._n. because you know the whole conversation is basically what can 

133.04 142.66 A: be done to prevent it i mean we've tried calling in there like you said with the u._n. and look what they do with iraq i mean this has been going on since what eighty one if i'm correct 

139.87 140.70 B: mhm 

142.38 143.54 B: (( yeah so )) 

142.80 155.73 A: you know so it's not like they had a month a year you know they all had twe- over twelve years and that conflict that we have or you know like you have i don't know if you're anti or pro you know with the war that just went on or it's still going on in iraq 

155.39 156.39 B: mhm 

155.80 161.06 A: you know you can talk but uh the the whole idea is you can talk but so much not to say that group force 

161.14 165.84 A: you know [mn] i believe group force should be used always as a last option 

165.80 166.97 B: yeah 

166.37 169.25 A: and i think with iraq i think that you know that was the 

169.32 181.04 A: the last you know 'cause you have a lotta protestors out there and you know they're like you know when it happens you know god forbid happens to us there's gonna be like ooh what did you guys do to prevent it 

180.79 182.13 B: mhm 

181.42 183.33 A: [mn] we took twelve years 

183.62 185.88 B: well i mean i- it it's really uh 

183.79 184.42 A: (( an- )) 

186.07 187.11 B: (( you know it's )) 

187.85 189.94 B: a hard topic because 

189.90 204.62 B: uh i know you really oughta be careful because you got troops stationed in south korea you got troops in japan and actually i was just stationed in japan for two years and i i just got out of the army i just got my honorable discharge so 

194.19 194.99 A: mhm 

196.41 197.14 A: mhm 

200.34 201.03 A: uh 

202.06 202.94 A: oh uh 

204.68 210.61 B: you know i mean this this was an issue that when i was in japan for two years japan was a very rewarding 

210.60 221.48 B: you know area to be stationed however you always had to whenever north korea was in the news you know we always paid a- attention more attention you know to that because you never 

219.05 220.03 A: mhm 

221.67 230.75 B: and because most of japanese people you know think that in north korea is you know just a a crazy country you know when it comes to the nuclear 

230.98 232.06 B: um 

232.11 233.96 B: plan and everything 

233.35 236.47 A: mhm you know what they're war mo- what we keep hearing they're war mongers 

236.42 237.41 B: mhm 

236.80 247.13 A: you know it's about you know 'cause i think like like i recently read you know i think they used their last card you know which is basically fear stating they have 

243.80 244.65 B: uh-huh 

247.18 259.03 A: sh- pointed and you know but like everybody says in the news when you when you resort to that last tactic you are you know you just you're playing your last card and basically you know and the the whole thing is about power 

255.54 256.99 B: yeah definitely 

259.15 260.20 A: (( you know it's )) 

259.20 262.49 B: yeah well it's also about intimidation too [noise] 

261.91 264.62 A: yeah well intimidation and power go hand in hand 

264.00 265.66 B: yeah yeah 

264.93 271.98 A: so it's you know like the you know mi- might deal it like with the not to say that the u._s. is 

271.99 277.97 A: knows everything and d- d- d- 'cause you know like everybody has their own point of view but you know 

277.76 291.41 A: you go back and you know just the thing with iraq this thing with you know who helped france who helped germany you know while the u._n. sat around and stated well let's talk a little more you know what you know there wasn't that the u._s. let's say went in there and said you know what 

277.93 278.59 B: (( mm )) 

291.40 297.84 A: screw all of you you know we're gonna go in there and do it and then the after when you get the pat on the back you know [mn] 

298.01 302.67 A: you like they like they say you always remember the bad before you remember the good 

302.09 312.02 B: oh yeah nobody really thought that iraq was gonna be as successful as it was you know 'cause sometimes i mean you just gotta take matters into your own hands and you gotta say well listen you know these people are 

303.43 304.06 A: (( [noise] [cough] )) 

306.71 307.34 A: hm 

309.67 310.45 A: right 

312.09 320.42 B: you know you separate the ones that are for ya or the ones that you know are just gonna stand there and do nothing or the ones that are just blankly against you 

315.27 315.96 A: right 

320.46 321.68 A: (( yeah you're right )) 

320.53 323.06 B: and you make your you know 

323.27 327.37 B: alliances and everything and then you go from there some times you can only do 

327.42 331.90 B: so much talking before you know you lay the last card on the table and you say listen 

331.04 331.98 A: (( exactly )) 

331.94 335.18 B: you know either you're gonna take it or you're gonna leave it you know 

333.76 335.03 A: mhm 

335.15 345.89 A: like i see with these protestors protestors but you know i see online and in papers and everything you know those protestors sit there and just like a lot of soldiers say you being an ex soldier you know [mn] 

347.02 356.53 A: those people who you know turn around and say thank you you know thank you for giving us our freedom thank you for giving us the chance to say 'screw you don't do this' you know because 

356.62 371.37 A: you would do that iraq and you you you know you you won't be able to do that you know that's what basically upsets me out like you know i have a uh cousin actually in the army actually he's going to retire after twenty years i have friends i have navy i have you know and i was like you know 

361.12 361.97 B: yeah 

371.39 376.13 A: you sit down when it comes to a time like this is when i sit down and i actually say you know what 

376.43 381.54 A: it's right thank you thank you the person i'm just speaking to right now for keeping us free 

381.15 382.31 B: mhm 

381.71 392.41 A: you know people in iraq you know that's what upset me especially with iraq you know they're like yeah you know we're going in there then all of a sudden after we did what we had to do you have a bunch of protestors 

392.38 393.25 B: yeah 

392.64 394.72 A: i was like you know we're in here for you we 

394.62 395.58 B: (( well i mean )) 

394.81 396.36 A: not in here for us 

395.90 403.81 B: the thing was that there's in japan uh japan is a very uh peaceful country now and it never used to be that way until 

401.39 402.52 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

404.29 417.17 B: you know after the world [sigh] war and we occupied japan and then you know it became a peaceful country they don't really have a lot of weapons over there and they're not allowed to and a lot of people said well you know we're anti war 

408.82 409.87 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

411.52 412.36 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

412.57 413.72 A: (( [noise] mhm ))

417.09 421.84 B: and you know we're thinking about their children and women in iraq 

422.32 424.78 B: and everything but what they told us 

424.80 425.38 A: (( [noise] )) 

425.11 434.29 B: you do realize is that you're making a a you know trying to make a better life you know for them and we had various protests but not not too many so 

428.97 429.84 A: right 

429.97 431.08 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

434.23 437.08 A: (( [noise] [noise] you know we had a [noise] i'm sorry [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

434.65 435.74 B: i think 

436.18 439.23 B: i'm sorry pretty much japan's uh we're always 

439.83 449.45 B: you know because as japan is our ally you know they had to support us you know politically but eighty percent of the people within it you know 

444.02 445.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

449.39 450.74 A: [noise] oh yes 

449.91 451.67 B: really support the war 

451.79 452.59 B: (( i m- )) 

451.91 458.68 A: yeah but like they said you know it doesn't i believe it was that nobody wants to go to war you just don't you know but 

457.37 458.14 B: yeah 

459.15 460.10 A: (( i mean i )) 

459.27 461.09 B: nobody likes that outcome

461.39 462.40 B: (( uh nobody )) 

467.31 471.58 A: what was done there how could the people not appreciate what was done 

471.75 474.96 A: you know now they've just found what a huge grave 

475.63 480.57 A: of of of people that he w- of how can you even attempt i mean you have to have a bit of 

475.83 476.84 B: yeah 

480.65 484.15 A: of self worth or something in you [noise] 

483.11 487.24 B: oh a lot of it's for attention too with all the media there you know 

487.30 499.90 B: people would do a lot of stuff just for attention then who knows 'cause the the media we don't know what they're doing over there who knows if they're trying to say hey listen you give me a story i'll give you some money some food whatever 

489.86 490.64 A: mhm 

493.25 494.52 A: (( [noise] [noise] right ))

499.91 501.58 B: who knows you know so 

501.72 510.12 B: it it's really it's really difficult in the media nowadays to to kinda sort out the truth and the and non truths you really honestly you can't really know 

507.10 507.94 A: mhm 

510.07 513.63 A: yeah it is yeah the that is true that is very true 

513.64 514.88 A: but i believe you know 

515.52 526.27 A: [sigh] how is it to how can we have prevented a lot of these wars i mean one thing you can't count on is the u._n. that's definite definite the u._n. i believe we should be out of the u._n. 'cause i [noise] [noise] 

525.28 537.49 B: yeah it's just well it's just an iffy thing it's just a political thing you know basically it just covers you know our bases you know just by trying to take you know these measures you know 

537.94 542.42 B: first we'll cover our bases and you know make us look good in 

538.62 539.61 A: mhm 

542.53 543.97 B: in the eyes of the world 

543.91 548.95 A: [noise] yeah but you know what to a point twelve years in the making of you can talk with so much it's 

548.03 551.94 B: yeah you can only talk with so much substance here before you need to take action 

549.52 551.28 A: yeah it's about time 

551.77 554.90 A: no we we need to divorce the u._n. that's what we need to do 

555.05 562.33 A: because when it comes you know bottom line we're the one's who [lipsmack] like i said we're the ones that go in there and basically save all of the you know 

562.21 570.27 A: everyone else and it's to to our benefits to a point but it's more to their benefit 'cause i don't believe that we did all this for for oil 

566.43 567.26 B: mhm 

570.57 572.31 A: you know no i don't 

570.92 573.78 B: no i don't believe that either at at all 

572.78 573.60 A: yeah 

574.01 576.89 B: um it doesn't seem what it's about

579.85 580.71 B: uh-huh 

580.41 587.07 A: so you know it's not or you know it's just like you know we're not gonna wait for it to happen to us you know whether they're gonna point the bomb at us and 

587.16 587.96 A: (( you know )) 

587.82 599.90 B: well yeah after nine eleven we and it kind of woke up and got that realization i mean there was acts of terrorism throughout history but you know until it really happens in your homeland you know in your
