321.62 323.60 B: it went well so yeah 

324.70 328.27 A: i i didn't actually have like oh they're doing different now on the airplane 

328.50 336.94 A: that's what i'm i'm gonna figure out 'cause like i i didn't see any like like police or anything and uh i just saw flight attendants and so it's like before 

330.73 331.62 B: uh-huh 

337.24 341.79 A: (( i think they should have like a security guard or something- or something in the airplane you know )) 

337.48 338.37 B: uh-huh 

341.04 345.98 B: mhm was what do you think of the pilots carrying guns 

345.42 347.32 A: oh are the pilots carrying guns now 

347.85 351.22 B: in some some of the airlines yeah 

350.54 352.55 A: (( oh i didn't know that oh )) 

352.05 353.44 B: yeah uh-huh 

353.57 357.99 B: just heard it on the news here in minnesota i don't know if its you know i mean it just 

358.08 360.22 B: here in minnesota 

359.85 360.73 A: oh 

360.87 362.61 B: yeah 

361.03 364.97 A: yeah um i don't know i i haven't heard of that yet but i 

364.21 365.78 B: oh okay 

365.40 375.98 A: i don't think that's necessary i don't think the pilots should be you know putting in a a position but i bet they want they just don't wanna pay money for like for extra protection you know 'cause they're just save 

374.28 380.55 B: yeah i you're you're right i think there should be like those marshalls or something like that 

379.15 381.43 A: yeah like a trained professional on the plane 

380.65 383.15 B: right people who know what they're doing 

382.87 392.92 A: yeah i mean if you've got a pilot pilot he's not going to be prepared for that it something like that happens it's gonna be a shock and you're not gonna just go come on and take that person's life you've got to think about 

392.38 396.48 B: well and he should be flying the plane not fighting the uh um 

395.50 397.00 A: (( it you know )) 

396.53 400.35 B: [laughter] what whatever is going on so 

397.69 398.83 A: (( yeah )) 

399.59 405.99 A: [laughter] i think when the airplane's in the air it's um automatically flies on autopilot so all they do is sit back and relax 

404.31 405.21 B: oh 

405.84 407.98 B: yeah that's true that's true 

407.73 409.80 A: they just land the plane when they
