6.86 8.15 B: (( juan how you doing )) 

7.75 10.29 A: i'm pretty good pretty good pretty good 

9.12 14.03 B: good i guess i guess the topic we have here is professional sports on t._v. 

13.73 15.18 A: yeah 

14.60 20.58 B: yeah i have to admit i'm not a uh i mean i like sports and everything but i don't watch it that much on t._v. 

20.31 21.25 A: why 

21.19 29.25 B: well i uh i don't know in a way it depends upon what the sport is uh the last major thing that i saw on t._v. was the uh 

29.28 35.78 B: well up to the finals in the uh n._c._a._a. 'cause as i say i'm from syracuse and of course syracuse won this year 

35.26 36.39 A: mhm 

35.78 44.90 B: so i did watch the last three games of that uh during the football season i might occasionally watch a game or two and then i'll uh always uh watch the super bowl 

44.82 45.81 A: okay 

45.39 48.73 B: but that's about the extent of my my my sports viewing 

48.81 52.34 A: see over here uh they rarely they don't 

52.40 56.37 A: like specially during the regular season they show some of the games 

55.80 57.33 B: yeah right 

56.52 59.36 A: like the sixers' games and the fl- flyers 

59.47 63.33 A: and the phillies but as it gets into the playoffs 

63.70 65.22 A: what they tend to do 

65.28 66.17 A: is 

66.59 68.83 A: either it's on c- it's on cable 

68.45 69.45 B: right 

69.25 72.99 A: and then if you don't have cable then you're out of luck 

72.40 77.85 B: exactly now is it on a a pay per view type of cable or uh standard cable 

73.37 74.39 A: so 

76.32 77.69 A: yeah 

77.82 81.87 A: well no it's not pay per view it's like the um 

81.94 86.48 A: the sixers and the flyers for instance they're both owned by comcast 

83.76 84.66 B: yeah 

85.93 86.89 B: okay 

86.51 92.72 A: so comcast is the cable company [laughter] here so they have their own sports channel 

89.22 90.32 B: oh 

92.53 93.93 B: okay mhm 

93.30 99.77 A: so all the games whether it be away or at home they're on either on comcast or e._s._p._n. 

99.54 105.60 B: yeah now with the comcast does that i mean does that come with your standard uh subscription for the cable 

104.67 106.29 A: yeah it does 

105.68 108.03 B: oh okay so that's not that bad then 

107.51 109.34 A: well no it isn't 'cause 

109.36 122.57 A: yeah 'cause before i remember years ago it used to be prism and the flyers you had to buy in order to get a flyers home game you had to pay the twenty five dollars a month just to get prism just to see uh a flyers home game 

122.08 123.52 B: oh wow yeah 

123.04 130.21 A: and then when comcast bought everything er all that changed so they make it this standard package now 

129.82 135.52 B: yeah see well just my basic cable and i get nothing extra on is like about thirty eight thirty nine dollars a month 

135.32 136.33 A: really 

135.74 137.78 B: yeah it's it's expensive up here 

136.58 138.85 A: well what kind do you have like digital 

138.61 140.15 B: uh 

140.30 146.52 B: no i don't i don't it i don't think it's a digital signal no it's uh it comes over a standard coax cable 

146.06 156.82 A: yeah see like over here they give they give you the option you can get analogue or you can get digital and for digital you're paying for like for one box like just to see the games and stuff 

148.22 149.04 B: yeah 

151.44 152.46 B: yeah 

156.54 157.53 B: okay 

157.01 160.63 A: you're looking at about sixty four dollars a month 

159.82 161.80 B: whoa whoa well 

161.28 163.76 A: that's without any premiums 

163.12 177.41 B: yeah well as i say mine is without any premium uh stations on it either and i remember when i first moved in this area i've been up in syracuse now about uh [sigh] oh about fifteen sixteen years or so it was like nineteen eighteen nineteen dollars a month 

167.61 168.36 A: yeah 

177.33 182.52 A: yeah i remember yeah i remember it used to be that low here it was like nineteen ninety five 

181.52 184.06 B: yeah we're dating ourselves yeah yeah 

183.42 185.38 A: oh my gosh [laughter] 

185.05 187.25 B: yeah it's expensive that's for sure 

186.38 194.52 A: and and it does and it's ridic- and if you're a sports fan of course you wanna support your local team and you don't wanna be the only one that 

191.92 193.12 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

194.41 204.75 A: that [laughter] everybody at work is talking about hey did you see the game last night and you can't tell 'em if you don't have cable then you're not it's like not having a phone mhm 

197.49 198.81 B: (( yeah no do you )) 

199.77 200.67 B: yeah 

202.23 203.37 B: yeah 

204.09 214.20 B: right it it well i agree with that yeah 'cause otherwise i'd get just just about three or four channels up here and the reception wouldn't be the greatest now do you watch a lot of sports on t._v. 

213.74 216.88 A: uh i tend to uh i usually watch um 

217.56 232.33 A: well i watch like basketball games uh i watch basketball game make sure that like the lakers i hate the lakers so i i root for every other team so every chance i get i watch i watch if the lakers are playing i i watch them just

417.25 430.45 B: oh jeeze well i tell ya i took my my my family oh it had to be six seven years or so up to a uh a bills game in buffalo and that and i tell ya by the time we got out of there i was down about two hundred bucks 

417.91 418.93 A: (( i i )) 

425.37 426.62 A: mhm 

430.72 432.55 A: [mn] it's ridiculous 

431.73 432.60 B: it 

432.68 433.76 A: (( and and )) 

434.37 437.26 A: [mn] you're paying like eight bucks for a hot dog 

437.01 440.07 B: yeah it's ri- it's crazy it is really nuts yeah 

437.36 439.07 A: (( it's ridiculous and and )) 

439.15 447.58 A: and it's it's like that's why you stay home you watch it on t._v. you can see the replays you can hear the play by play 

447.17 450.02 B: yeah well you're right there you're right there yeah yeah 

448.82 454.90 A: see and that's the best thing 'cause you're there 'cause i remember i went to one hockey game when i was small 

455.25 456.95 A: right and my dad 

457.42 459.23 A: and my dad was 

459.28 467.23 A: we went there he spent about this was in the seventies he spent about seventy eighty bucks back in the seventies was a lot of money 

466.65 471.44 B: yeah yeah you any of the any of the you know the franchise the uh the major leagues it's crazy 

469.20 474.15 A: and and then then i'm looking at people right they're sitting there 

474.30 488.35 A: and about seventy per cent of the people at the game either has a radio or a t._v. so they can hear the play by play otherwise uh i'm like i didn't like it for the mere fact i'm looking down at the ice 

482.37 483.45 B: yeah yeah 

486.85 487.68 B: well 

488.08 489.11 B: yeah 

488.59 493.77 A: and you're all you're seeing them skate up and down you don't know what's going on 'cause they don't do a play by play 

491.73 492.70 B: yeah you're 

493.40 495.02 B: right yeah 

493.86 496.34 A: so i and then i turn around and see people with 

496.97 498.64 A: headsets on 

497.91 500.65 B: that's a good point really a good point you're right 

500.20 503.32 A: ah see and and that takes away 

503.14 518.11 A: that takes away 'cause if if i was going to a to a basketball game yeah you're hyped about going to see the game and you don't get to uh you don't get to see the the unless you look at the big t._v. screen up but then you can't hear it 

518.44 519.08 B: yeah 

519.26 524.67 A: and see and that takes away that's why i rather stay home and watch it you're in the comfort of your own home 

523.98 525.21 B: yeah 

524.81 532.01 A: you know halftime you go get your little snack breaks you need to go to the bathroom you don't have to wait in line [laughter] 

531.03 540.90 B: right right yeah well and and the darned expense i mean it it it's ridiculous i don't know how a a family you know a working family nowadays could afford it i they they can't [mn] 

532.62 533.75 A: you know you 

535.46 536.16 A: (( yeah )) 

540.53 542.51 A: you don't 'cause right now 

542.55 550.61 A: uh like for instance sixers they're selling playoff tickets now playoff tickets are forty two dollars right which is cheap 

550.38 551.27 B: yeah 

550.79 555.48 A: for a playoff ticket for one ticket but that's in the nosebleed section 

555.24 556.37 B: yeah yeah 

555.54 562.92 A: okay you're taking your kids and it's up there they're not gonna enjoy themselves for one because it's so far up 

558.40 559.58 B: yeah [laughter] 

560.21 560.94 B: (( no )) 

562.31 564.67 B: yeah you really can't see anything is right 

563.31 565.59 A: (( then yeah then )) 

565.79 572.60 A: that's say you take i have two children i take two and me that's a hundred and twenty bucks right there easy 

571.64 572.78 B: yeah 

572.78 576.78 A: that's not counting food parking's ridiculous 

576.24 576.85 B: (( yeah )) 

577.10 580.03 B: that's right you've got all the other incidental expenses mhm 

579.96 591.55 A: yeah see so we stay home we watch it on t._v. halftime we can run we could drive over to mcdonalds [laughter] get get halftime snacks then come then come home 

591.42 599.89 B: yeah it's a good point good point yeah it's uh it's it's crazy but as i say uh you know kinda when i first started off i i don't watch it that frequent 

593.31 594.78 A: (( so i ))
