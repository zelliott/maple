15.67 17.33 A: bioterrorism 

16.93 20.40 B: [noise] uh uh so what do you think the u._s. could do to fight terrorism 

19.05 19.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

22.04 23.42 A: uh 

23.80 27.90 A: well of course what they're doing now is supposed to be part of it but you know 

28.15 30.54 A: if they find any weapons of mass destruction that's 

30.94 32.44 A: who knows that's going to happen 

32.97 34.22 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

34.35 36.49 A: what do you think just i guess just being there 

36.64 38.58 A: keeping our eyes and ears open you know 

38.49 41.45 B: so you don't think what they're doing now is effective or do you 

42.60 43.48 A: mm 

44.18 46.04 A: i guess depends who you ask i i 

46.43 47.82 A: (( well it seems so )) 

47.86 49.46 A: [laughter] complicated but uh 

49.75 53.29 A: nah i guess it was a good idea there's just no it's 

54.29 58.88 A: hard to say you know going i mean going to war over it is that worth it maybe maybe not [noise] 

59.24 63.76 A: well it all depends on what happens you know next year or five years from now you know 

63.50 64.72 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

63.91 67.00 A: as far as re- as far as rebuilding the country and [noise] 

67.28 69.14 A: as long as you don't let it you know 

69.98 72.69 A: get all messed up like afghanistan or whatever 

73.36 78.40 A: you know if everyone starts fighting again all these factions then it's not going to look too good you know 

77.98 81.90 B: yeah you think that's going to uh affect terrorism in the united states though [noise] [noise] 

81.66 85.73 A: yeah i'd i'd i'd i think it sh- if we come out with i- it you know 

86.11 91.37 A: it's doin' a good job [noise] obviously not kill we don't even know how many civilians iraq civilians died 

90.92 92.42 B: no they don't count that 

92.30 104.02 A: they're supposed to someone is [noise] the u._n. or whoever does that [noise] red cross somebody's supposed to be getting these numbers the government i think is supposed to it's not i think we're supposed to know this i was reading but um [noise] 

104.21 109.58 A: if we did a good job technically then uh you know i think maybe some of the people in arab world 

109.66 111.53 A: will hate us less [noise] you know 

110.83 112.58 B: [laughter] 

112.16 112.95 A: (( so )) 

113.28 115.56 A: at least i hope so [noise] [noise] 

114.72 115.91 B: yeah 

117.16 120.31 A: but uh i don't know what else what else can we do 

120.51 121.44 B: (( i don't know )) 

120.61 129.08 A: obviously like just monitor you know monitor it those roads [noise] whatever countries and make sure we know what they're doing what their 

129.37 134.85 A: leaders are doing and what what's going on over there you know i guess that's a job for the c._i._a. i su- i suppose [noise] 

135.18 139.16 A: yeah so we know who's buying what who's buying nerve gas you know [noise] 

138.47 148.05 B: right i think with the technology we have we can uh find out these things before it's so late that we have to go war to to stop them and i i don't think that 

139.49 140.10 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

146.89 151.20 A: we should but we miss i mean [laughter] yeah i i same thing for nine eleven though we missed 

151.37 165.71 A: appar- i mean that's what they say you know hindsight's twenty twenty right but [noise] we missed so many apparently so many cues and the f._b._i. knew about these people and that guy mohammed atta they knew he was in the country well the c._i._a. knew he was in the country and they got the warnings to the f._b._i. too late 

153.87 154.75 B: right 

165.85 167.70 A: or whatever [noise] 

167.74 172.85 A: so if we can get all these just for our you know agencies to work together then yeah it'd be a lot better 

173.85 175.53 A: share information better you know 

175.31 176.41 B: (( right [noise] )) 

176.26 178.74 A: [noise] that's one thing i would help [noise] 

179.55 180.74 A: um 

181.99 184.19 A: [noise] what else [noise] 

183.02 190.07 B: uh i don't think fighting these wars is gonna is gonna help fight terrorism though i think it's just creating new terrorists when we do it 

190.14 196.14 A: yeah i mean that's what i'm worried about invading iraq and now we got our problems with who knows what's going to happen with syria and 

190.52 191.75 B: actually helping them 

196.97 203.03 A: and of course then there's north korea yeah obviously that wars or should be the last resort you know 

203.32 206.13 A: it should be a just war to begin with 

206.34 208.64 A: i don't know if this is technically a just war 

206.68 207.24 B: (( [mn] )) 

208.70 213.99 A: i think you have to be attacked for it to be a just war i don't know what the international law is but 

212.99 216.02 B: yeah i think it's against [laughter] international law but 

215.45 220.28 A: [lipsmack] just going in there because we don't like saddam hussein isn't a good [laughter] enough reason 

220.91 224.91 A: and a lot of people took the part for their viewpoint like the french i mean they just 

225.14 228.16 A: they did what was popular which is you know to go against it 

228.50 237.78 B: right also though the whole i- it was it was based on a lot of lies like uh like bush kept connecting hussein with al qaeda when there was no evidence for it 

228.63 229.62 A: but uh [noise] 

233.59 234.19 A: (( [noise] )) 

237.31 241.77 A: and that's what i was saying you know i mean i don't trust him as far as i could throw him [noise] 

240.87 242.18 B: [laughter] 

241.91 247.20 A: i mean if i i don't want to say that they just want to make money [lipsmack] 

247.50 258.46 A: and with the oil and everything because obviously you know halliburton and all dick cheney's company and and rumsfeld's company or [noise] vector or halliburton or whoever they're going to be in there they already are 

259.03 261.37 A: you know and their stock shot up how much i mean 

261.83 265.55 A: [noise] they're really gonna make they they got seven hundred million dollar contracts already 

261.92 263.18 B: (( right i think it's uh )) 

266.09 268.88 A: to build the infrastructure rebuild it or whatever the hell they do [noise] 

268.67 281.45 B: i think of the things you're talking about like i think i think cheney is just doing it for money and and personal greed but someone like bush i i don't i don't i don't think he has enough of capability [laughter] to do for that i think uh he doesn't really know what he's doing 

269.04 269.64 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

280.01 285.41 A: yeah [noise] but i don't know i mean i don't know that much pretend to know that much about it 

285.81 291.66 A: i just don't i mean obviously i don't know if i trust that many politicians or people to begin with you know what i mean 

289.83 291.29 B: yeah i know i don't [noise] 

291.91 306.00 A: i me- obviously the world's not an ideal world and all i'm not trying to be a paint of it you know look at it with a rose what do they call it rose colored glasses but when you read i- obviously you can read something if people will say what bush did in texas before when he was governor and all the stuff he was doing 

305.85 320.76 A: to make money illegally [laughter] he was like he was doing enron type type stuff back back then before he was even the you know president i mean he was definitely implicated in some things but to get a way with it all i mean i don't know 

321.26 333.60 A: [noise] so yeah i don't certainly trust all his intentions and he isn't i read one article i guess i [noise] read it in the city paper about this guy i don't who it was he really likes tony blair [noise] 'cause 'cause i mean the [noise] the britain guy 

321.39 322.31 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

333.81 336.68 A: 'cause he was just more um straightforward he 

337.07 341.65 A: doesn't seem so shifty 'cause george bush like says something different [laughter] everyday 

341.97 345.86 A: you know especially when it comes to the weapon mass destruction there's all this stuff going on 

345.75 347.08 B: right 

347.03 348.47 A: (( [noise] but so )) 

348.75 351.62 A: i guess back to bioterrorism um 

350.91 352.07 B: [laughter] 

353.15 359.21 A: what else can we do and i guess obviously they and obviously they're increasing our national security well they're trying to 

353.33 354.11 B: i 

359.22 360.95 A: of course part of that is um 

361.52 369.90 A: you know fooling around with the bill of rights 'cause they don't like so much and detaining people just for the hell of it you know [laughter] all that stuff 

365.20 366.15 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

369.22 371.75 B: yeah that's pretty scary they've they have all those people 

370.65 372.01 A: the patriot act 

372.97 381.44 B: yeah they found all those people down in guantanamo bay that they haven't charged with anything they don't they don't have lawyers or [laughter] anything they're just being kept down there 

381.77 385.15 A: and then those are the guys who are technically p._o._w.s right 

384.41 388.51 B: yeah they were uh taliban fighters or 

385.44 386.76 A: right 

387.97 393.30 A: okay well i don't feel so bad about them but i feel worse when it's american citizens 

388.67 389.87 B: yeah 

393.10 405.97 A: or it's people who have been here for ten years and they're just trying to get some schooling and like when like in i._n._s. where they screw something up in the i._n._s. some little thing and now they're sent back they're sent back to pakistan they have [noise] family here and everything and it's like bullshit 

397.85 398.96 B: well if they're 

406.20 407.28 B: right 

406.72 408.30 A: they get totally screwed 

407.99 415.07 B: the thing about guantanamo bay is maybe they are all criminals but if they're not allowed access to lawyers then you know you have no way of knowing so 

414.99 429.52 A: [noise] yeah i'm not sure how that works with the international law he can somehow if he don't if you don't call 'em p._o._w.s if you don't call 'em whatever you're allowed to [laughter] do that i mean why couldn't other countries do the same thing to our soldiers then [lipsmack] i mean that's [noise] that doesn't make sense 

423.39 424.38 B: right 

427.87 432.20 B: well the iraqis did and then we called them uh uh war crimes or whatever when we were fighting there 

432.88 434.41 A: [noise] i guess i mean 

434.91 436.30 A: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

436.50 438.68 A: that's a great idea but 

437.91 439.26 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

439.06 443.98 A: well yeah anyway yeah increasing the national security and um you know [mn] shoot man 

444.17 452.00 A: someone went and obviously i i don't know i mean i wouldn't be surprised if there's some cells still here you know people hanging around working at a gas station whatever 

451.06 453.81 B: oh i'm sure they're all over the place [noise] 

454.24 455.35 A: [noise] but you know 

456.06 468.71 A: as far as you know trying to um spending so much money on stupid sometimes it seems so stupid the one thing i'm worried about the most is article an article i read about the nuclear power plants i'm not worried about someone bringing a bomb in here 

468.99 480.13 A: you know or or via ports [noise] 'cause you can get you can get things in a port sort of pretty easily now i mean there's just so much room for it you know [noise] so there's so much you can do [noise] with all the billions of containers that come into the country but i mean 

480.64 489.95 A: [lipsmack] did you read that about that nuclear power plant i mean they're so like [laughter] the security sucks especially the one at three mile island up in uh upstate new york or whatever 

489.46 490.68 B: yeah 

490.29 495.29 A: yeah all they got to do is all they do is destroy one of those cooling towers or whatever they have like um 

495.96 505.48 A: ponds of water they drain it all they have to do is break into it they have minimum security i mean some of these you know those guys are armed but there there's a whistle blower guy who used to work there he used to be a marine 

505.63 508.90 A: he blew the whistle on the whole thing he's and talked about all the weaknesses you know 

509.15 514.52 A: [noise] i forget what magazine that was in but all they got to do is drain one of those pools so the rods stop cooling 

514.68 528.67 A: and then and then boom radiation poisoning will poison everyone the entire city of new york millions of people you know at least half a mill or something like that will get cancer probably like i don't know how long but within a year you know something like that 

520.24 521.53 B: (( [noise] right )) 

528.71 534.65 A: something crazy it'll make it'll make manhattan in hospital [laughter] i'm just i'm that and it and it's an easy thing to do [noise] 

534.67 539.73 A: get five people who were really well trained that's got you know have plans and machine guns and that it's done 

539.92 541.59 B: (( right like you said it's [noise] )) 

540.12 544.36 A: that's the dumb way i'm more worried about that than anything else and i don't think they're doing anything 

542.48 544.39 B: there's there's so many ways [cough] 

544.39 548.15 A: [lipsmack] they're not doing shit about it the nuclear regulatory commission and stuff 

547.88 549.23 B: right 

549.12 550.34 A: (( [noise] yeah they're not really )) 

550.92 558.92 A: you know how money it's just all about money and who's got money and uh [noise] who's greasing whose pockets and shit like that dude and i don't think they're doing anything to beef up the security of these power plants [noise] 

559.30 560.10 A: so 

559.36 560.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

560.23 566.61 B: it's kind of a uh feudal thing to try though i mean there's there's no way they can stop any kind of terrorist attack in the united states so 

566.52 575.92 B: you kind of have to hit the root of the problem instead i mean if someone wanted to you don't even have to go after a nuclear power plant you can kill like a few dozen people at a time over and over again and 

567.32 568.67 A: [lipsmack] [noise] not really 

575.99 580.38 B: you know you'd get close to the same numbers eventually and you can't stop that kind of thing [noise] 

579.05 585.04 A: [lipsmack] it's not even the numbers i mean i am sure obviously i guess that's where they're looking they're looking for when the world trade centre they want something that's um 

585.37 589.26 A: very public and very you know a symbol you know that's what they go for 

589.82 590.79 A: (( but um )) 

590.52 591.38 B: [noise] [noise] 

591.12 597.15 A: it's a lot to do it's a lot to do i mean plus if not to mention this what they can do over the computer over the internet 

596.99 598.09 B: right 

597.30 599.95 A: you know disrupt their financial systems and stuff i mean
