103.47 110.18 B: it's pretty easy and my brother was saying they have a real shortage of men responding so i was 

104.35 105.64 A: yeah 

109.96 111.14 A: wow 

110.68 113.53 B: glad to hear a male voice on the other end this 

112.12 113.94 A: is this your first call 

113.68 118.28 B: is my second although i'm worried my first might be excluded because i 

114.54 115.42 A: really 

118.52 132.98 B: got on my line that has no call waiting cause they said call waiting can interrupt it but um the other line that i was not on rang during [laughter] so there's a phone ringing in the background i have no idea if that's going to disqualified it or not 

122.77 123.82 A: right 

127.49 128.54 A: oh 

129.06 131.60 A: [laughter] 

132.35 134.55 A: so when did you receive tickets to 

134.90 140.63 B: as a child actually when they were playing at stadium and john brody was the quarterback 

140.25 144.52 A: ooh so do you like football in person or on t._v. better 

140.81 142.03 B: so 

143.41 146.70 B: i do believe it or not i actually um 

146.83 150.36 B: played on the boys football team when i was in high school 

150.67 157.52 B: and then they all got way too big for me though so towards the end of high school i wasn't doing much playing but i love football 

157.99 160.01 A: do you think it translates well on t._v. 

160.50 165.42 B: yeah actually i think it's um easier to watch on t._v. than in person 

165.36 166.18 A: yeah 

165.44 176.13 B: in person if you're not like in really good seats it's hard to see everything and you don't get as much commentary unless you're like listening to a radio at the same time 

175.44 176.66 A: right 

176.05 186.69 B: so it's hard to figure out what's actually going on sometimes if there's a penalty or you know what yard they tell us what yard they're on but still when you're watching on t._v. you get a lot of um 

178.90 179.79 A: mhm 

186.77 193.35 B: you know commentary and history and anything else about the team and stuff like that about the players 

192.74 194.17 A: do you watch hockey at all 

194.46 202.40 B: not much i think even when there are hockey play offs and stuff you know i don't think uh i don't even know what a san francisco hockey team 

202.36 204.30 A: well they have the same as a sharp 

204.28 205.63 B: (( that's it )) 

205.72 211.60 B: yeah i think with our weather here hockey's not as big as in some states where the kids can actually 

211.67 212.54 A: right 

211.89 213.58 B: play a lot of hockey 

213.38 217.01 A: hockey's hard to follow on t._v. too cause the pretty small 

217.37 219.84 A: um live is a much better game 

219.85 222.57 B: ah as long as you don't get hit by the puck 

222.32 224.60 A: yeah they have the giant nets up now 

225.05 228.60 A: so that they can't shoot them into the crowd cause that one little girl was hit 

228.37 230.95 B: yeah that was highly publicized 

230.51 233.40 A: (( [laughter] )) 

232.17 236.45 B: well i just got tickets to a giants game this summer i have a lot of people 

236.59 250.61 B: visiting from out of state and i think that oregan doesn't have a baseball team and they're all from oregon so they're all requested to uh go see the giants at the new packbell park so we're gonna go do that 

241.63 242.48 A: no 

248.64 249.76 A: oh cool 

250.23 252.16 A: do you watch baseball on t._v. 

251.80 259.73 B: occasionally i have a hard time sitting through a whole game i'd rather come in towards seventh or eighth inning and see what's happening 

255.09 256.22 A: me too 

259.16 263.99 A: everybody i know who watches it on like a sunday ends up falling asleep at some point of the game 

263.39 266.27 B: it's long and there's not that much action 

265.57 267.08 A: [laughter] 

267.03 274.20 B: that's why even like even just like playing football more than even playing baseball because there is too much standing around 

273.87 275.35 A: so were you up set about 

275.38 276.21 A: (( leaving )) 

276.53 279.22 B: well we'll see yeah i mean 

279.47 282.88 B: [noise] i thought he was doing a pretty good job but 

282.19 283.47 A: right 

283.01 285.35 B: i thought that was a real political 

285.92 288.53 B: thing and not really what's best for the team 

288.64 290.25 B: but we'll have to see 

289.87 294.65 A: is football pretty dominant in uh san francisco is it like the most popular sport 

294.08 297.88 B: um i don't think so baseball is pretty popular 

297.26 298.46 A: yeah 

298.02 310.17 B: yeah i know um baseball tickets are just a lot even though the giants are a little difficult to get to see it's a little pricey and they sell out it's still a lot easier than getting tickets to a niner's game 

309.73 310.99 A: right 

310.30 323.80 B: so and watching t._v. you know at least it's um seasonal so [laughter] we watch football during football season and we watch baseball somewhat a lot less i mean football sunday is football sunday 

315.18 316.06 A: right 

319.67 320.85 A: [laughter] 

323.25 324.50 A: right 

323.85 326.31 B: but now football's expanded to 

326.41 329.36 B: thursdays and mondays [laughter] 

328.65 330.05 A: and saturdays 

329.60 332.66 B: yeah there's a lot more days where you're watching football 

332.13 334.54 A: do you get to watch all of games too 

335.02 349.75 B: you know oakland intermittently does not sell out enough tickets so they don't um yeah then they won't televise it you're always hearing a couple days before the game they still need to sell so and so more tickets to uh 

339.29 340.37 A: really 

349.69 353.26 B: televise the game i guess they're not doing as well over there 

351.96 352.93 A: wow 

353.91 357.49 A: cause i always thought they had the craziest largest fan base 

358.13 361.92 B: they're crazy but maybe they can't afford to buy tickets 

361.27 367.99 A: yeah sometimes they used to have when the eagles were bigger but the owner i think like the local station would just buy the remainder tickets 

368.11 371.30 A: give them away to charity or something so they could get the revenue 

371.12 376.41 B: yeah yeah sometimes the commercials are better than the uh game 

371.31 372.06 A: (( from )) 

376.32 377.94 A: [laughter] 

377.72 382.47 B: during the superbowl there's commercial we come just to watch that too 

381.70 383.11 A: [laughter] 

383.94 388.88 B: i know a lot of the women come just in to watch the commercials and then they go back out to the kitchen [laughter] 

388.63 391.53 A: do you eat while you watch the game on sunday 

390.59 391.67 B: um 

391.83 404.63 B: not every sunday no during the during superbowl definitely everyone has their specialty that they make and bring and it's a big party but on our just on a regular sunday i try to avoid 

404.89 407.28 B: eating too much football food 

406.86 408.41 A: so you don't go through 

408.54 413.14 A: i guess you don't really go through withdrawal you only have like three months where there's no football or baseball 

413.25 416.41 B: and then there's always basketball and 

415.61 416.97 A: do you watch basketball 

416.74 421.75 B: um again the only thing i really watch religiously is football 

421.41 422.17 A: (( it's )) 

421.81 424.76 B: the other stuff i don't know if something 

423.73 425.40 A: just boring 

425.36 434.43 B: yeah boring and it's hard i have two kids and you know committing time to sitting down and watching a game if they're not into it i've two girls 

433.83 435.00 A: (( how old are they )) 

434.86 436.46 B: they're eight and ten 

436.19 437.83 A: they're not into it or are they 

437.89 449.90 B: well i think they must of caught my football fever because they're excited to watch a football game and they are not that excited to watch i don't evening think they know all of the rules for like a basketball game and a 

450.02 455.08 B: although they did go to basketball camp one year i think they probably learned some of the rules 

454.63 457.34 A: do they play any of the sports like soccer or anything 

457.02 467.27 B: um they swim they're on the swim team and actually they do rock climbing indoor and some outdoor rock climbing like they're more into um 

459.53 460.32 A: right 

464.99 466.20 A: (( uh huh )) 

467.57 470.22 B: more individual sports than the team 

469.85 473.13 A: do they watch i guess swimming in the olympics 

472.81 474.85 B: yeah they enjoyed that 

474.39 478.25 A: but do they have like favorite swimmer like posters and stuff 

478.04 487.87 B: uh no they haven't gotten that crazy yet i think maybe the next time the summer olympics come around they'll be old enough and that kind of stuff to make maybe have it catch on 

487.40 488.76 A: right 

488.48 490.03 B: so do you have any children 

489.92 492.55 A: no i have two dogs 

490.63 491.38 B: no 

492.11 494.27 B: two dogs what kind of dogs 

493.64 494.33 A: (( they're )) 

494.75 497.42 B: oh i have a crazy dog 

496.92 498.29 A: what kind 

497.71 502.21 B: her mother was a basset hound and her father was a rottweiler 

501.80 502.97 A: wow 

503.20 505.06 A: is it big or small 

503.30 504.26 B: [laughter] 

504.48 511.43 B: well she's eighty pounds but she's about six inches off the ground [laughter] she's really crazy looking 

507.79 509.53 A: [laughter] get out of here 

510.00 511.97 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

512.16 516.96 B: she's like a rottweiler who was cut off at the knees and stretched a little longer 

517.53 519.72 A: do you think there's too much sports on t._v. 

520.25 524.15 B: um no i think i'd rather watch sports than some of the other 

523.45 525.13 A: i know what 

524.16 526.30 B: junk that's on so 

526.67 530.49 B: no i think sports i think that's a great thing i think it's um 

530.51 534.70 B: better for kids to watch than almost any of the other stuff 

534.13 536.38 A: about monday night football do you watch that 

535.78 541.15 B: yes definitely and the great thing about being in california is it's on at a reasonable time 

540.62 543.38 A: is that good though cause it starts at like six or eight 

542.82 551.79 B: oh it's perfect people get off work and they go right to where ever they're gonna to go and you get to bed before midnight and you know it's over by nine pm 

551.60 556.71 A: see i always think that wouldn't be as much fun because he's more like a party on a monday night 

556.59 558.94 B: well you don't have kids 

558.22 559.67 A: yeah that's true 

559.21 571.21 B: me most of our parties involve people and families that also have kids so to have them over on an evening to watch football is great if it's done by nine o'clock and you can kick them all out and put your kids to bed 

563.52 564.42 A: right 

570.87 572.20 A: right 

571.66 580.27 B: so i think it's great i i don't know how people on the east coast stay up until especially the baseball games they go on until one in the morning 

580.37 581.72 A: then you get um 

581.73 584.25 A: your sunday games start at like ten 

583.76 585.25 B: ten in the morning 

584.83 586.87 A: wow what's that like 

586.46 593.97 B: that's great too we get up we pack up the car and drive to the stadium or whatever if we have tickets and i don't know i guess um 

594.21 597.94 B: people who go to church have a hard time watch the morning game 

597.51 598.62 A: right 

598.07 599.89 B: that's definitely a conflict and
