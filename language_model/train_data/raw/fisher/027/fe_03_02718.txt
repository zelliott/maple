19.51 21.02 B: (( [noise] [laughter] yeah um )) 

21.04 29.61 B: yeah but you know that they have that on twenty four a lot they have bioterrorism [laughter] now we're talking about bioterrorism on t._v. um 

25.82 28.25 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] that's true [noise] [noise] )) 

28.88 29.99 A: [laughter] 

30.19 33.21 B: i guess we're not supposed to go off the topic so 

33.08 34.25 A: oh okay [noise] 

33.55 37.34 B: what can the u._s. do to prevent bioterrorism 

37.41 38.47 B: uh 

39.07 43.54 B: i don't think there's much that the u._s. can do to prevent bioterrorism 

43.56 44.13 B: (( [noise] )) 

44.98 45.94 A: um 

46.10 46.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

46.37 55.12 A: you know i w- i'd i don't know how much you can do overseas but i i do know that i- i- in the homeland that there has been um efforts [noise] taken 

55.07 56.19 B: (( mhm )) 

55.42 56.25 A: um 

56.49 59.19 A: you know with the c._d._c. um 

56.64 58.01 B: [noise] w- [noise] 

59.78 61.24 A: in atlanta 

60.03 62.59 B: what kind of efforts have they made 

62.50 70.09 A: um basically tracking where um things have been um transferred and stuff like that 

69.14 70.29 B: (( mhm )) 

70.31 78.20 A: [lipsmack] um i guess also oh you know what one of the cool things is with genetics you can tell where um you know when you find like 

78.22 82.49 A: oh uh what was that stuff that went around recently the uh 

82.44 84.11 B: [noise] [noise] oh the anthrax 

83.76 93.57 A: the anthrax well they could determine exactly where it came from so you know you could you know it basically have to find the people who are do [laughter] doing these things [laughter] 

84.68 85.83 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

87.45 88.51 B: right 

92.33 93.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

93.85 95.21 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

95.16 100.70 B: [noise] but they but that's not preventing it though because they can't find it until something goes wrong [noise] 

95.74 96.77 A: (( think [lipsmack] )) 

101.21 102.13 A: um 

102.30 103.33 A: (( why don't you )) 

102.34 110.55 B: so they're more they're more dealing with it after the fact 'cause they can't trace the anthrax until it turns up in some place it shouldn't be 

111.03 117.07 B: right and then they trace it and then they can maybe prevent futures by the same people but 

112.10 113.31 A: yeah 

117.82 122.72 B: it just seems like i don't know it's a little scary it just seems like it would really only take one 

123.02 124.17 B: good 

124.44 126.00 B: unexpected 

126.10 128.55 B: thing to do a lot of damage 

128.29 130.14 A: yeah [laughter] 

129.14 136.59 B: i don't mean to be negative [laughter] but that's what it seems like [laughter] and they wouldn't really be able to do too much until 

131.35 132.43 A: (( no [laughter] it's )) 

132.75 133.53 A: true 

136.79 137.94 B: after 

138.10 149.95 A: yeah and just like the other thing the sars thing i don't you know that just seemed so weird that um you know where did that come from and um you know it starts to kind of 

138.63 139.64 B: it happened [noise] 

146.15 147.21 B: (( right [noise] )) 

148.40 151.79 B: [noise] but where really does any epidemic come from [noise] 

151.65 153.09 A: right that's true 

153.43 160.42 B: you know there wasn't any bioterrorism back in the days of the plague and there was very little travel between countries even 

160.67 164.23 B: but still they managed to spread the plague all over the place [noise] 

163.95 169.98 A: um well actually the the travel was with ships it was a trading ship and it was the rats on ships 

167.29 168.68 B: (( right right )) 

169.70 170.80 B: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

170.70 176.29 A: [laughter] so you know if you wanted to get your wheat from somewhere and you know here comes the rats [laughter] 

171.03 172.16 B: (( right [noise] )) 

175.01 178.89 B: [laughter] right here comes the rat infested ship 

179.10 180.00 B: um 

179.24 179.93 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

180.58 182.72 B: (( uh yeah it i uh )) 

182.73 187.04 B: it i- that's one of the scarier things out there is the whole bioterror 

187.25 188.11 B: thing 

188.31 198.31 B: i can't believe yesterday i refused uh i was busy and i didn't talk and i it was just about holidays and now it's [laughter] that's what i thought i was going to talk about today and now it's bioterrorism 

193.58 194.85 A: (( i know [laughter] )) 

198.37 205.31 B: which i try not to talk about [laughter] 'cause it scares me too much to talk about it [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

198.78 199.47 A: (( you know )) 

200.40 202.62 A: (( you know the honest truth like i don't like )) 

203.29 204.08 A: [laughter] 

204.94 210.00 A: you know you know what one thing is interesting too though you know you talk about with sars and and 

210.44 214.46 A: that the global globalization evidence through air travel 

214.49 215.95 B: (( right [noise] )) 

214.74 222.73 A: [noise] and it was like with the aids epidemic they like kind of traced you know who brought the first aids epidemic into america and it was and it was 

220.65 223.23 B: yeah they could find the first person 

223.22 225.97 A: and it was an it was a air line steward 

224.99 226.84 B: [noise] right 

226.03 228.37 A: it was through air travel [laughter] 

227.71 228.63 B: right 

228.81 230.40 B: so i guess that 

228.95 233.03 A: (( [laughter] you know so i guess you [laughter] you go back to immigration [laughter] )) 

230.98 234.21 B: airline stewards are the are the rats of our day 

234.70 237.33 B: [laughter] 

234.89 240.60 A: [laughter] i guess so you have the ships are right there air planes [laughter] 

238.30 239.65 B: right 

239.90 241.29 B: right 

241.40 244.73 A: so um i guess we no more travel [laughter] 

241.54 242.87 B: that's why 

244.96 252.37 B: yeah but it it all just seems i i mean when you really look at the number of sars cases it's it's pretty contained 

252.31 253.64 A: right yeah 

252.36 261.76 B: but it's probably the only new epidemic we've really had in our life times of a completely new disease and that's why it's getting so much attention [noise] 

261.64 272.46 A: well you know what's kind of weird is um i where i work there was this guy who actually had been travelling quite a bit and when i went into work one day i hadn't seen him in about a couple weeks and 

273.03 285.50 A: he had this terrible cold and he was sniffling and he felt like he was coming down with the flu and he had told me he had just come from a plane from like um china or something and this was of a you know about a month or so and i'm like 

284.46 285.54 B: right 

285.54 287.20 A: i'm like you know 

287.69 300.02 A: was it sars [laughter] you know did you get contact with sars or anything i haven't heard it it was before it got really well known it was like i hadn't heard about it and it's like and i'm thinking watching him thinking you know with the american work ethic of 

300.33 311.99 A: you know i don't care if i'm on my death bed i'm still going to drive myself to work [laughter] so and we and we also have the attitude of oh it's nothing it's nothing it's nothing and i got to go to work and you know 

303.87 305.03 B: right 

312.18 317.10 A: just that kind of attitude that can be very scary about people bring that with them 

315.09 324.58 B: right but it's something it if there is some sort of bioterrorist introduction of a disease then it would spread more quickly because of that [mn] 

323.50 328.82 A: right yeah just in fact one of them you know gets someone who doesn't care about going to work wouldn't of got sick 

328.18 329.26 B: right 

329.12 332.35 A: (( [laughter] but it's a lot of people [laughter] )) 

331.06 334.94 B: but with the anthrax the people who died were elderly people 

335.35 341.66 A: and wasn't there the what about the one that was she was the mysterious one they couldn't figure out how she caught it 

339.81 347.24 B: [noise] yeah she was the only one they they didn't know how she got it or but she was also i think older wasn't she [noise] 

345.80 350.60 A: i'm not too sure it was in the it was in new york wasn't it and she was a drugger 

348.95 349.96 B: yeah 

350.91 351.92 A: yeah 

351.01 352.87 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

352.17 359.89 A: and um then i think they had an anthrax well one of the post office i guess since i'm like out of did they know what it was or 

356.48 358.35 B: (( yeah )) 

360.28 362.78 A: um did they come up with what that was mm 

363.15 368.16 B: [mn] the post uh they were able track it to which post office it came from [noise] 

367.81 373.11 A: there was two post office recently that were just they had the white powder in 'em and i think they were like 

371.22 376.35 B: oh really recently no i haven't i hadn't heard about that [noise] [noise] [noise] 

373.21 374.58 A: yeah 

375.45 378.63 A: one they said it was nothing and the other one um like some of the 

378.60 393.17 A: some of the people had to go to the um doctor's because they had said their throat was burning but you know i- it that could just be a suggestion oh my god something's wrong and you know who knows if it really happened or their mind just played it up or 

383.04 384.68 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

388.58 389.94 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

392.37 393.81 B: (( [noise] right )) 

394.38 395.60 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

394.43 400.29 A: yeah but you know maybe those people are trying to have a have the idea walk around with a mask on your face 

399.89 407.21 B: although they say the funny thing is that um that they were on the daily show they were making talking about sars and they were saying that 

407.17 415.33 B: i- doctors are saying that those masks really don't do anything against sars but then they showed a convention of doctors and they were all wearing the masks 

414.98 416.72 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

415.79 418.60 B: [laughter] so i don't know if it does something or not 

418.41 422.27 A: [laughter] pretty soon we'll all have our plastic bubbles [laughter] 

418.82 419.77 B: it just 

420.66 427.86 B: [noise] yeah we'll just be walking around in our bubble i mean i'm flying i'm on a gonna be on a plane tomorrow and i worry more 

427.85 438.68 B: rather than about bioterrorism just about the fact that [noise] anybody on the plane can be sick and the air is so recycled it just always seems like everytime i travel i get sick 

435.26 436.26 A: right 

438.90 441.73 A: [lipsmack] yeah yeah mhm 

439.93 454.34 B: you know so i- it does seem like it would be awfully easy to uh just keep trying to i keep trying to bring the topic back to bioterrorism 'cause they say that you have to talk on the topic and i guess it you know the point of that would be again air travel makes it all very easy 

447.13 447.91 A: (( [noise] )) 

454.88 455.92 A: um 

455.01 461.18 B: but [noise] i guess the method of prevention would be to make sure that nobody has access 

456.41 457.32 A: yeah 

461.33 467.46 B: to bioterrorist agents bi- bioterror agents but it just seems like they're 

467.68 469.94 B: so easy to come by 

470.36 478.41 B: in a sense [noise] you know that i mean but i don't know uh whether they're well how much serious 

470.43 471.27 A: yeah 

472.23 473.09 A: (( yeah mhm [noise] )) 

478.72 484.68 B: damage could be i've read some things that say it's all kind of a s- just like a s- a big scare and that really 

484.72 489.18 B: the the types of agents that are readily accessible are not really going to be that damaging 

489.25 495.22 B: and the more serious agents that could really wipe people out are very difficult to uh 

495.50 497.87 B: manage or culture or whatever 

497.88 507.10 A: right um yeah and it's and a lot of it will depend on you know i- if something hits are you down wind are you up wind you know up to the scatter 

504.81 505.91 B: (( [noise] right )) 

506.09 508.40 B: but what about that the um 

508.79 512.82 B: the uh thing that happened in the subway in japan a few years ago 

513.01 515.93 A: oh oh yeah um 

514.98 515.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

516.56 517.42 A: [laughter] 

516.90 519.76 B: [noise] the ricin gas or whatever it was 

519.42 524.14 A: right and didn't and it didn't right when the war started they found ricin gas in um 

523.82 529.87 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah yeah [noise] 

524.76 525.88 A: in paris 

527.02 528.46 A: in a paris subway 

529.74 530.78 A: (( you know )) 

531.42 532.60 A: (( i- it )) 

531.97 534.18 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

534.04 540.64 A: it just really you know you well you know first of all i think what is important is that the government recognizes that 

536.58 537.75 B: [noise] [noise] 

538.44 539.68 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

540.92 543.40 A: you know with bioterrorism that there there's 

543.73 552.83 A: that when and something does happen it is happening and you know i think about what what's happened with the troops i remember when they first originally came back from from iraq um 

544.14 544.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

552.48 553.05 B: (( [noise] )) 

553.06 555.18 A: a lot of them were complaining of 

555.12 555.73 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

555.77 556.71 A: (( of )) 

556.16 556.79 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

556.93 571.38 A: symptoms and had really bad symptoms and the government was like oh that's nothing that's nothing we're not going to treat them the d._a. is not going to do it and they did the same thing in vietnam they you know people came back exposed to agent orange and they said uh uh you know you're making it up it's nothing 

559.64 561.16 B: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

561.18 562.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

562.46 564.23 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

566.12 567.08 B: mhm 

570.07 571.49 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

571.40 572.27 A: and 

571.51 572.48 B: right 

572.17 578.87 A: you know and it's like well wait a second if we're sending people over there you've got to recognize [laughter] that when they come back that something it 

574.96 576.85 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

577.73 581.01 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

578.63 592.17 A: and in this i think when they came back from iraq too like their families were getting it you know they had been exposed to something that their families were getting and the and then our government's going [lipsmack] no it's nothing [laughter] you know and people are on their deathbeds with hair falling out [laughter] you know 

583.75 585.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

587.87 589.90 B: right right yeah i know 

590.39 599.89 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] right and who exposed them to the to those bioterror agents was it was it the military or was it foreign that's what n- never 

592.53 593.11 A: (( uh ))
