144.78 147.37 B: oh yeah i think so too yeah more than 

147.02 148.92 A: you know cause well you know they 

149.62 156.35 A: not so much the sport but they also have the dancing they have the costumes they have the music you know

153.92 161.11 B: yeah yep yep i know i know it doesn't even seem to you like it's a sport it is more a dance than anything else you know 

158.58 159.48 A: right

187.95 190.99 B: um but that's the way it is you know

194.26 195.71 B: yeah i think 

195.82 201.03 A: uh because god knows you can't go to any of the games and y- and they're all getting expensive

202.52 203.35 A: i mean 

204.62 208.62 A: no and and and and so much so that it it's almost 

209.26 217.04 A: it it it really is a shame it really is a shame because it almost takes the fun out of you know going

215.47 216.34 B: going 

216.38 218.01 B: just going it's true

235.29 236.69 A: mhm mhm 

236.62 247.99 B: and you know not so much going up and watching it on television of course when they were losing he'd shut it off and say i'm not going to watch those dumb red sox anymore you know five minutes later he'd turn is back on yeah you know to see how they were doing 

243.20 244.13 A: mhm 

244.94 246.67 A: he'd turn is back on right 

247.43 249.28 A: [laughter]

288.10 291.12 A: i mean and and we're talking a minor league game 

290.38 294.44 B: right right i mean nothing even in the big leagues you know i know 

292.31 304.93 A: yeah yeah and and [laughter] yeah a hot dog is three dollars a cracker jack is three fifty you know [laughter] and i'm sitting here thinking my god this is costing us almost a hundred dollars 

295.03 296.29 B: it's ridiculous 

299.11 300.33 B: isn't that ridiculous 

304.30 306.25 B: for not for what an hour game 

306.08 308.88 A: well two hours you know but 

306.86 309.76 B: two hours and you're done isn't that ridiculous 

309.17 312.98 A: yeah and i'm saying for god forbid if we had gone to the red sox it 

312.38 313.39 B: oh yeah 

313.02 318.61 A: would have been fifty bucks a seat you know ten dollars for a hot dog i mean you know just 

315.01 316.05 B: yeah right 

317.90 320.49 B: i know it's like out of hand you know 

320.15 327.70 A: everything is out of hand these days so so you really have to watch you know if you are a fan of any kind of sport you have to watch it on t._v. 

321.05 323.38 B: (( yeah yeah it is )) 

325.82 326.62 B: yeah 

327.42 332.43 B: you do that's the only way and of course you know i mean college wise 

333.02 342.38 B: big for us with the women's basketball you know i mean i don't go to the games i have a girl who does cause her boyfriend is a school and he's big big box but that's even expensive 

334.46 335.33 A: mhm 

341.96 343.59 A: yeah yeah 

342.96 346.41 B: you know um it it's just out of hand 

345.79 355.46 A: yeah but you know you watch a game like like i know that when my husband watches the red sox he watches the game on t._v. but he listens to it on the radio 

350.61 351.80 B: right right 

353.06 353.83 B: yeah 

354.62 357.02 B: (( on the rad- i know isn't [laughter] that something )) 

356.84 363.59 A: and i've never quite figured out why or how he does that you know he'll turn the t._v. on and he'll turn the radio on 

358.75 359.66 B: why 

360.14 361.09 B: (( right )) 

363.01 365.01 B: i'm sure there's logic behind it but 

364.40 373.85 A: well he says that he doesn't like the commentators the commentators on the t._v. set because he said that they just sit there and chitchat about nothing 

367.16 367.95 B: oh 

370.00 370.81 B: oh 

373.31 376.03 B: yeah right i think he's probably right 

374.02 381.61 A: you know cause you know baseball is it's not a you know it's not like football or it is not a fast moving game 

379.15 380.27 B: no no 

380.74 382.87 B: no it's not no it's not 

381.63 385.91 A: you know it's very slow moving so you get the commentators and they're talking about you know 

385.58 386.77 B: other things 

386.18 390.96 A: yeah they're talking about what they had for dinner last night yeah exactly 

388.58 392.46 B: like who cares you want to hear the game you want to hear the game you know 

392.21 400.33 A: right so my husband said you know they ought to play just some kind of jazz music in between you know because 

392.52 393.97 B: i mean it's crazy 

397.33 398.84 B: well that's true who 

400.03 402.33 B: wants the listen to somebody else's problems 

401.81 406.77 A: yeah exactly you know if i mean if i wanted to hear gossip you know i'd turn on the gossip station 

406.23 407.80 B: here you go i know 

406.98 412.57 A: but uh you know so that's what he says is the problem with the t._v. commentators is that they you know they 

410.07 410.91 B: yeah 

411.67 416.82 B: well yeah he's probably right yeah they they really talk about everything but the baseball you know 

413.58 414.88 A: you know too much 

416.33 423.25 A: right right and then when something does happen they all but they almost just about miss it you know [laughter] cause they're not paying attention 

420.42 421.57 B: yeah right 

422.53 425.07 B: oh what happened i know i know isn't that 

424.17 425.46 A: but um 

425.72 430.10 A: you know but uh we still watch the baseball game and so we've got 

428.26 436.42 B: yeah that's about it i'm not a big football fan i i mean i never was you know and basketball's okay but 

431.95 433.25 A: yeah 

435.67 441.61 A: you know being in boston you know i i our team all our teams are disappointing [laughter] 

437.70 438.57 B: (( i know )) 

439.28 443.75 B: yeah yeah especially boston is such a big you know sports town 

443.67 445.85 A: yeah it really is 

444.05 448.24 B: you know you know i mean for everything i mean even the hockey and the 

448.03 451.71 A: yeah but you well you know they've all had great 

448.50 449.45 B: and all of that 

451.83 458.60 A: histories you know the celtic's had a great you know the t- the seventies was great for the celtic's the 

452.87 453.74 B: (( right )) 

454.36 455.41 B: oh yeah 

456.29 457.06 B: yep 

457.79 459.07 B: (( yep yep )) 

458.56 465.73 A: seventies were great for the bruins you know and god knows the red sox have a great history but you know they 

461.52 462.47 B: yeah 

465.52 470.62 A: all of them price themselves out of the average person to talk about 

469.96 470.92 B: (( yeah )) 

470.41 481.93 A: so you know you watch it and then even when you do watch it you're almost a little bit turned off because you hearing about you know this one wants to strike and you know 

476.47 477.60 B: you're right 

480.56 485.13 B: oh i know yeah and the are striking and then the the you know the players a striking 

484.40 490.22 A: you know and i'm sitting here and i'm thinking hey somebody who's making ten million dollars i could couldn't care less if you strike 

489.50 495.67 B: well me too yeah you are absolutely right right i mean number one i think they're over priced to start with i mean over paid to start with 

490.50 491.45 A: (( you know )) 

493.45 497.38 A: they're all over priced yes they're all over paid yeah 

496.95 503.46 B: i mean everybody's worth money but not that kind of money i mean you know then they get an injury and they're still getting their money you know 

499.61 500.58 A: right 

501.99 515.37 A: yeah yeah so um you know so almost you know so you watch them because you like watching the game but it it really kind of sours you when they start talking about you know striking and and you know problems 

507.40 508.82 B: i know yeah 

513.31 517.62 B: strike salary disputes oh i should get more money than this one and 

517.05 519.12 A: yeah yeah 

517.84 520.53 B: and that you know which which is i mean 

519.44 523.05 A: exac- i mean what could a person a person possibly do 

522.64 523.43 B: (( i know )) 

523.09 524.25 A: that they 

524.79 525.58 B: yeah 

525.19 526.55 A: could get 

525.87 527.09 B: that kind of money 

526.64 530.05 A: that kind of money i mean how is that possible 

527.33 528.69 B: (( i know i know )) 

529.62 538.67 B: i know it doesn't seem possible i mean you know you take a physician or somebody that you know is dealing with a persons life you know okay they're worth money you know 

530.99 533.66 A: no it doesn't it doesn't 

535.87 536.89 A: yes 

538.31 540.62 A: but they're not getting ten million dollars 

539.87 543.33 B: no they're not no not even close not even close 

541.65 545.47 A: you know they're not getting ten million dollars for a little bit of work 

543.66 547.77 B: and they don't even play you know twelve months a year 

547.90 549.90 B: you know i mean they're not even a full time 

549.92 552.20 B: job [laughter] like you or i are you know 

550.87 553.53 A: right yeah 

552.60 555.60 B: it's true it's very true it's sort of sad 

553.99 554.85 A: um 

555.05 556.36 A: yeah and then 

556.69 563.99 A: and then you hear about you know the drug problems and all of that and it makes you want the slap them in the face and there and say hey 

559.24 560.15 B: (( oh yes )) 

562.32 569.83 B: yeah you're right i know or this one's on steroids or this one's on something else you know [sigh] it's crazy yeah 

564.07 564.90 A: (( you know )) 

568.44 572.37 A: yeah so it it really does you know sour you and 

571.60 573.15 B: it turns people off yeah 

572.48 576.89 A: yeah and i know a lot times when i'm watch the game you know uh like 

577.43 579.92 A: i know in boston when when they got 

580.70 581.54 B: uh-huh 

581.10 588.18 A: and you know he was paid you know like this astronomical amount of money every time he came out i kept saying is that him 

585.59 586.34 B: right 

588.21 590.18 B: i know [laughter] yeah 

588.33 588.90 A: (( is )) 

589.48 599.95 A: that him you know my husband would say yeah that's him and i would be like why doesn't he cut his hair he's got enough money you know why doesn't he and do anything and and sitting here and all you can think about is how much money this guy is 

594.88 595.63 B: yeah 

596.23 597.22 B: yeah
