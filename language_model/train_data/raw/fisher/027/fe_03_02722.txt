0.06 1.21 A: hello 

0.22 1.44 B: hello 

1.65 3.40 A: hi my name's caitlin 

3.32 10.99 B: hi my name's dana i haven't done this before so i guess we we discuss bioterrori- bioterrorism amongst ourselves is that how it goes [mn] 

10.57 18.85 A: yeah this is actually the second one that i did it was bioterrorism and what do you think the united states can do to to prevent it or protect you from it or something like that 

19.31 21.64 B: well you can go first if you want 

21.32 25.69 A: uh [laughter] okay well i think that uh 

22.77 23.91 B: [laughter] 

25.95 36.06 A: i mean i am a believer that knowledge is power so i think that the more funding we put into studying the possibil- the possibilities that are out there and the the mutations that can occur 

35.91 49.58 A: the better we're gonna be at being able to keep up with it i mean if you looked at like today's headlines regard sars it's mutating faster than uh asia can keep up with it because they are not putting as much money into their uh research programme as we are 

50.32 53.91 A: so i mean i think the more research we do the better prepared we are 

54.05 62.63 B: oh i i i agree that that it has to be researched as well but i also wonder if maybe we could locate the sources of bioterrorism 

62.87 70.67 B: if that would help out as well um we can actually establish i mean this vague term bioterrorism what 

70.80 84.65 B: do we have what what do we know is i mean it's just like a boogie man out there we don't know what's out there and i think we need to figure out what it is exactly that's out there that's threatening us you know and then then we i think that would also help 

84.52 89.31 A: right 'cause people are more scared by things if they don't understand exactly what it means 

89.76 95.49 B: right right and we don't know where it's coming from who's going to do it and we need to find that out i think 

95.55 101.86 A: right well you're absolutely right about the the concept that bioterrorism is really vague and we don't really know what it means 

101.91 109.66 B: right uh one of our local post offices here recently was closed down for several hours because they found a suspicious white powder 

109.70 116.54 B: and you know the whole neighbour was evacuated and they news choppers all over the place and it turned out to be nothing 

116.50 118.10 A: right where are you located oh 

117.85 119.35 B: i'm in arizona 

119.00 120.05 A: okay 

120.01 124.83 B: and i think i think they do need to educate knowledge is power educate the public as well 

124.60 125.55 A: right 

124.97 133.67 B: you know this is you know not just oh you know what like okay here's another example i sent my sister a package she sai- i ordered it online 

131.51 132.78 A: mhm 

133.75 143.34 B: so through through ebay sent to sent it to her in indiana she didn't recognize the address so she soaked it in water because she was too she thought it was bioterrorism 

143.15 144.71 A: oh man what was in it 

144.80 159.72 B: it was a book [laughter] [laughter] yeah i bought it for her as surprise she didn't so people you know if if you just ad- people need you know the the people need to educated you know just everyday people like you and me 

145.86 148.60 A: oh no [laughter] 

159.86 165.92 B: as well as as well as the um you know more definitely more research because that sars 

166.05 169.09 B: it's it's mutating exponentially i believe 

168.88 170.51 A: yeah see 

170.47 177.18 A: and i think the other thing is is that it's a scary concept to people because it can happen on such a small scale i 

177.00 187.72 A: mean the thing is that if uh if a government of a country decides to build nuclear weapons it's hard to do that in secret for very long because it's a large scale project but any bozo 

186.13 189.03 B: oh very good point a very good point yeah 

187.60 193.87 A: you know any bozo with a knowledge of chemistry can concoct something in his basement and set it loose you know 

193.46 207.70 B: right right my next door neighbor you know could be a bioterrorist and but then again you know i'm again here here in arizona you know how far do we go to to where we're you know watching everybody and going oh is this person a bio- 

207.55 210.44 B: bioterrorist oh i've got to watch him that type of thing 

210.24 213.74 A: right yeah i know it makes everybody suspicious of everybody else 

213.50 214.97 B: exactly you know 

216.64 224.21 B: [laughter] last week i i i i had occasion to talk to a police officer he was standing up on a jack of the box and i i 

224.13 228.93 B: and i said hello to him and he said hello to me very like oh my gosh what are you doing lady 

228.77 233.41 B: and when i went in the restaurant i realized i had powdered sugar from a donut on my face 

233.09 234.58 A: oh 

233.25 244.05 B: and i had white powder on my face and i'm thinking oh great now type of people you know am i gonna get people surrounding me like she's got white powder she's got white powder [laughter] you know 

241.44 244.27 A: right aye aye aye 

244.21 251.17 B: so i i believe that the you know educating the public definitely you know people just have got to stop being scared of this 

251.04 252.05 A: right 

251.64 260.97 B: you know where i work you know they've got they've they've closed off the mail room and the the mail is now opened by two people and we- wearing gloves and masks and everything 

260.93 262.01 A: right 

262.04 263.02 B: so 

262.21 270.02 A: well i live in new york city so [laughter] i'm right in the centre of it um it's actually yeah what were you going to say 

264.33 265.58 B: (( ah )) 

267.85 268.67 B: (( what )) 

270.29 274.60 B: i i think that that people in new york city probably have a totally different mindset 

274.68 277.24 B: than than everybody here in arizona 

277.23 278.38 A: right 

277.37 290.63 B: because because you've been affected you know first first hand you can see the affect of terrorism and you know out here we just get you know little little scares you know noth- nothing of consequence most likely which people have experienced 

281.69 282.91 A: yeah 

290.60 294.33 A: well i think that that's true but i think that um 

294.57 304.60 A: i don't know maybe it's scarier to be out where you are and just hearing about it you know again because of the vagueness thing maybe it's it's even less scary to new yorkers because they witnessed it they 

304.91 308.28 A: you know they went this okay this is what it is now we know 

309.39 312.18 B: oh gosh see i don't know because because 

312.79 325.88 B: see arizona we're we're people in arizona were kind i i'm a native of arizona we're kinda tough and our attitude is is it doesn't matter who comes along we'll just pull out whatever our six shooters and blow 'em way that's it [laughter] 

323.37 326.67 A: [laughter] south frontier mentality 

326.45 338.41 B: exactly exactly we're you know we still have that frontier mentality going on you know it doesn't matter what what what comes our way we're we're we're we're going to blow it away but but yeah i i think that that actually have 

338.34 344.91 B: witnessed and experienced terrorism like like you folks did i think that's that's that would cause more 

345.42 355.70 B: that would make me a whole lot more i don't want to say paranoid because that's the wrong term but more fearful more more watchful than than so like you know me going out shopping and everything 

356.00 358.77 A: well it's it is um 

359.01 369.26 A: scarier about riding the subway i have to say that's that's the one way in which my life is you know really i think permanently impacted by it is that uh 

361.36 362.30 B: oh 

369.26 378.41 A: is that you it makes people wary now every time you go into the subway you know if if you can take an alternate mode of transportation you certainly opt to 

373.94 374.83 B: well 

378.49 385.17 B: is it because of bioterrorism because it yeah there was that big box i don't know if you heard about this this was several years ago 

380.40 381.89 A: yeah well 

385.20 388.50 B: uh big bioterrorist attack in japan 

388.63 390.89 A: right right in their subway 

389.26 390.32 B: um 

390.83 394.56 B: in their subway exactly so is that is that why oh my gosh 

394.49 400.32 A: well not even that so much but just i mean yes that is part of it but just the idea that like if you're gonna 

400.17 412.86 A: create a bioterrorist attack in new york it makes the most sense to do it in the subways because it'll be trapped down there and it can travel through all the different tunnels without necessarily escaping to the surface where it could dissipate in the atmosphere 

412.54 414.49 B: [mn] oh gosh 

413.78 421.49 A: so it seems like that it it makes sense as a target the way a large office building would make sense as a target as well you know 

421.38 426.92 B: and and i don't think here in arizona we see ourselves as as a good target for bioterrorism at any level 

426.78 427.71 A: right 

426.98 439.35 B: because well you know i i i don't know if you've heard of timpee i live in timpee it's it's like right next door to phoenix and you know there's not a lot of of of good big targets for bioterrorism here in arizona 

439.17 440.05 A: right 

439.33 449.85 B: you know i mean if if you were gonna attack a subway or you know they can attack the state fair here in arizona you know i think i think you folks unfortunately would be more of a victim that we would 

449.97 455.11 A: yeah well i mean it's [laughter] the higher profile you are the more of a target you are so 

454.48 456.29 B: exactly exactly 

455.30 465.90 A: new york is definitely way up there los angeles you know places that are washington d._c. you know but also national monuments all across the country you know are gonna be 

464.91 472.50 B: and and and the valley the phoenix the phoenix metro phoenix area is a very large place people don't think about how lar- i mean it's like the eighth largest 

472.64 485.37 B: uh uh area in the country you know it's where its population but it's spread out you know for example i could be jump in my van within an hour i'd be out of town in in the desert heading for the woods and i'd be i'd feel safe 

485.26 489.22 A: right you'd feel safer away from civilization than in civilization 

487.95 497.72 B: well i mean if there were a bioterrorist attack i could i could i could load up my kids load up my dogs in the van and and a half an hour i'd be half an hour i'd be out of town i'd be safe 

497.62 502.52 A: right and so you do think that would make you safer going some place more deserted 

500.20 507.67 B: i well i i yeah yeah i mean if there was a like a bioterrorist attack yeah in in in the downtown area definitely 

508.01 509.06 B: definitely 

508.06 515.88 A: i wonder if people are taking that mentality and building you know essentially bomb shelters but out in the wood somewhere you know 

515.61 528.96 B: oh yes there are there are there are tales like that here in arizona yes and see there's a lot a lot of the survivalist mentality here in arizona i mean that y. when people were doing the y2k thing everybody here in arizona you know they they go their lofts they got their 

528.84 537.56 B: you know ten ten zillion crates of toilet paper and they stocked it up in the woods you know [laughter] that type of thing you know they're ready to run at a moment's you know 

533.93 534.89 A: right 

537.55 544.19 B: and and to me i just i don't think it it affects my life that much on a day to day bas- day to day basis 

543.80 554.00 A: right well it's funny 'cause it's a different mentality 'cause in new york it wouldn't do us any good to run [laughter] you'd have to you'd have to drive for so long to get to a place that was deserted that uh 

544.38 545.25 B: and i 

548.35 549.99 B: yeah oh yeah 

553.87 555.93 B: oh my gosh yeah so 

555.05 557.43 A: it wouldn't do you any good 

557.13 569.90 B: yeah i mean ev- even in the valley you there are places that you can go that that are basically you know dirt lodge but you know i mean not well big time parks that type of things you could go and and you know feel safer than 

569.77 582.52 B: you know from a terrorist than than just seating you know like at the at the i don't know like at the courthouse that's the only place that i could think were a bioterrorist attack is likely to take place it would be like at the at the federal courthouse or something like that 

581.39 583.62 A: right some sort of government building 

583.53 587.96 B: yes i mean we just don't have the big uh the big high profile areas 

587.75 599.89 A: right well the scariest thing for me after september eleventh was that they locked down the island of manhattan like i couldn't wrap my brain around that i'm going what does that mean they locked down all of manhattan you know it seems like such a 

588.64 589.84 B: you know
