503.18 504.15 A: uh-huh 

503.95 506.25 B: you know when they kind of tell about the players 

504.53 506.53 A: (( you feel like you know them ))

508.64 510.24 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

509.38 520.86 B: and i will i will watch a team if i've kind of developed an understanding of these kids and where they come from that kind of thing i'm the say way i wonder if a lot of women are like that [laughter]

530.87 533.61 B: the boys and the girls too 

531.72 535.31 A: yeah right 'cause you know what 

535.81 546.12 A: what's going on in their lives or whatever and you just i don't know i just have been more involved with it when i know the participants you know 

544.83 546.28 B: that's right 

546.31 560.89 A: so [lipsmack] [sigh] and there's a lot of it going around because it seems like that more and more you hear about these pro athletes now getting into trouble you know with something and and i know that that's 

546.46 547.56 B: (( yeah )) 

557.37 558.62 B: yeah
