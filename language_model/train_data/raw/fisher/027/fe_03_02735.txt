222.92 224.20 B: what happened 

223.62 227.70 A: they had the electric cars that were around back in the sixties and fifties sixties

229.78 230.86 A: but uh 

230.28 233.50 B: electric right now but you know but that doesn't uh 

233.73 235.93 B: that doesn't help out the big business 

235.42 238.17 A: yes all the republicans have their oil 

238.15 239.79 B: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

238.70 240.94 A: (( refineries down texas you know don't wanna mhm )) 

239.95 244.30 B: and and so all the oil would be treated and it's not economical for us to 

244.68 251.86 B: to have uh gasoline and oil driven cars you know then that when that day comes we'll see the electric cars 

251.97 257.30 B: come about with no problem oh we've been able to do this for years yeah but uh 

257.66 263.64 B: until we deplete the earth of all its resources who knows when that will be but 

263.16 266.23 A: mhm well with the republicans in the white house it shouldn't be too much longer 

265.85 267.93 B: oh yeah [laughter] true

282.87 284.94 B: mhm 

283.05 284.44 A: and 

285.40 287.62 B: yeah what's with this sars thing

288.41 294.02 B: do you think that's bioterrorism at all or no 'cause it's just not at all right 

291.18 292.06 A: no 

292.62 295.46 A: no it's just a you know one of those

295.65 297.30 A: mutated bugs [noise] 

297.59 301.68 B: mm yeah it didn't even start in the u._s. so that that that wouldn't be 

301.55 303.98 A: yeah and it's not it's not uh 

301.76 303.74 B: tell you what 

304.25 306.20 A: virulent virulent enough 

306.24 307.93 A: it's not a it's not nasty 

307.61 310.10 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

308.63 309.52 A: i mean 

310.64 312.32 B: (( yeah )) 

310.68 313.47 A: there's only been what like two or three deaths from it you know it's nothing 

312.73 315.60 B: [mn] right right right 

314.18 315.27 A: nothing big 

315.87 318.27 B: well i'm wondering kinda why 

318.53 325.17 B: there hasn't been any kind of other attack on the u._s. right now like bioterrorist or just some random dude blowing himself up in the street 

324.95 338.98 B: i mean you see that crap all the time like you know in the newspapers about israel and suicide bombings and bus bombings and you know it really so easy for someone to just do you know a terrorist act like in new york city at any point like 

337.67 338.43 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

338.84 350.04 B: somebody could strap a bomb to them and just walk into the empire state building and blow themselves up it wouldn't necessarily blow up the building or anything like that but still [mn] it'd kill some people you know you don't what what would happen to all these uh 

346.32 347.30 A: i mean 

347.52 348.29 A: (( yeah )) 

350.25 351.30 B: you know 

351.59 353.32 B: (( bin laden and uh )) 

353.79 356.41 B: al qaeda type people you know what do they 

354.00 359.00 A: mm i mean you can make a simple pipe bomb with nails you know a nail bomb 

358.63 366.97 B: yeah how come no one's doing that not that i want that but [laughter] you know like like where is that and uh it's so eas- you know 

361.22 362.39 A: (( yeah uh-huh yeah )) 

367.00 369.71 B: things are easier than they seem and that's definitely 

369.73 380.56 B: brought about by nine eleven i mean look what happened [laughter] so it's like uh uh i'm surprised that there hasn't been anything else whether it's small scale or or large scale you know 

370.99 372.16 A: (( mm )) 

380.87 383.56 A: it it might be just something as simple as you know they're afraid to 

383.65 384.50 A: i mean 

384.71 388.73 B: maybe they're intimidated because you know oh we're showing a iraq this and 

388.58 391.31 A: yeah well that's exactly what we did you know with afghanistan 

391.44 392.46 B: yeah 

391.88 393.47 A: (( and you know )) 

393.78 394.47 A: (( well )) 

393.79 396.73 B: it feels like the bin laden stuff's been taking a back seat 

396.74 398.17 B: you know obviously 

397.03 400.60 A: actually um it was a couple of weeks ago they uh 

400.88 402.37 A: they nailed one of his uh 

402.51 403.76 A: top lieutenants 

404.06 407.24 A: and he was singing like a canary he gave like 

407.48 409.82 A: all the names of like hundreds of names 

409.51 412.32 B: (( really i didn't know that )) 

410.08 411.23 A: yeah 

411.68 417.56 A: actually it was um interesting like the prime minister of the of the interior for the country of qatar 

417.42 418.62 B: right 

418.01 419.57 A: is um 

421.40 422.38 A: al qaeda 

422.55 423.62 B: (( really )) 

424.43 428.07 A: so that that really put a damper on al qaeda 

428.51 430.43 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

428.88 430.03 A: but 

431.47 432.62 B: [noise] um 

432.59 435.02 A: the problem is the problem is our borders are so open 

435.06 436.56 A: you know insane 

436.54 438.86 B: (( yeah they really are )) 

439.29 440.09 A: (( you can ))

464.33 466.63 B: amazing [laughter] 

465.14 467.82 A: yeah and coming back's pretty much the same way right right 

466.94 472.99 B: but going back is not as much the same way but it's still like pretty like 

471.68 472.46 A: (( mhm )) 

473.05 480.98 B: chill i don't know i mean i got hassled going back in threatened to be thrown in jail by the mexican police so i didn't have a 

481.19 485.89 B: easy time getting back [laughter] it was pretty bad i mean like uh 

486.30 491.75 B: this is where i mean i don't even think they care that we're not talking about bioterrorism they just want us to talk over the phone 

491.33 492.10 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

491.76 504.59 B: but um anyway so i might as well just tell you the story seeing it's so interesting so i'm going over the border me and my friend were on a surf trip right and uh going back from uh where we were san- san miguel and uh

541.79 543.11 A: (( mm yeah )) 

542.55 556.19 B: so when he asked for it i saw that they didn't give me a new slip when we changed the date that we were going to mexico they just crossed out the date we were going to go and put the new date over it [laughter] so we gave it them and then as soon as i gave it to them i realized we're fucked because this is just 

547.38 549.88 A: (( mm )) 

555.83 557.01 A: yeah

567.55 572.18 B: and then he just hassled us to death about it and uh you know he said we're gonna call them and if you if 

572.27 583.61 B: you call them and you know and they say something different then you know we're putting you in jail like you know you can't lie a mexican police officer we're gonna throw you in jail and i was like all right i've no reason to lie go ahead call them and i gave them the number 

579.46 580.53 A: mm

589.18 590.82 A: mm 

596.24 599.90 B: you know and they just basically wanted money out of us obviously so
