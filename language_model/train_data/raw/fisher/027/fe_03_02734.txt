3.24 4.68 A: fine how are you 

4.17 7.04 B: oh good where are you located 

6.10 7.99 A: um saint louis how 'bout you 

7.51 14.16 B: saint louis i'm in new york [laughter] okay so we're not too far you're out in the midwest kind of and 

9.13 10.51 A: (( oh okay )) 

12.39 16.86 A: [laughter] yeah so you're probably more scared of bioterrorism than we are 

15.94 19.95 B: um actually i used to live in ohio and i just came to new york 

19.78 20.93 A: okay 

20.28 31.17 B: so i don't know like i was a like when i first came out here there was the big thing about um stuff being in like coca cola you know like anthrax or whatever was being slipped in there 

30.84 32.07 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

31.42 34.23 B: i don't know i think the government to prot- 

34.36 38.48 B: pre- um prevent bioterrorism they should pretty much [sigh] 

38.40 50.05 B: not like they should look into the mail stuff a lot more i think and lay off the airline stuff i think pretty much everything's gonna be sent somehow through mail or animals so i think they should be 

50.05 54.58 B: regulating animal transportation into like you know 

54.72 61.08 B: all over the u. s. coming in here watch things that are being shipped over in the ships and stuff i think that's the best way 

60.01 65.01 A: [noise] [noise] yeah and the food coming into the united states like the fruits and things like that that's 

64.24 70.43 B: yeah just pretty much everything [laughter] yeah everything that's imported should just be like watched very very carefully 

70.76 72.33 A: (( right bu- )) 

71.42 74.41 B: that's probably what i think the best bet is for now 

74.29 80.10 A: [noise] i think also they need to keep on the terrorist list and get all those terrorists 

79.66 85.07 B: yeah [laughter] like i don't really know what happened with that war over 

81.20 82.46 A: but of course [noise] 

85.08 89.22 B: like in iraq it just like stopped out of nowhere or something 

89.44 96.92 B: i'm really confused i had i don't really watch the news too much so i don't really know anything truthfully about what goes on 

95.92 102.03 A: [noise] well our major troops are out of there but they're trying to get all the head honchos 

102.08 111.54 A: but i think that they need to get all the al qaeda and hamas and all those people because they're the ones that want to do harm to the united states 

110.80 119.56 B: yeah and they need to make more treaties like with other countries just like say like peace treaties just saying hey we're not gonna screw you over don't screw us over 

119.42 130.24 B: [sigh] and maybe like help out other countries a little more just to be like on everybody's good side you know just so nobody will wanna do that again in the future you know just keep peace with everyone else and you know 

124.28 126.28 A: [noise] but i think [noise] 

130.06 136.18 B: we could probably lessen all the rush like with the other like one or two countries that wanna screw with us you know 

135.51 138.23 A: [noise] well the thing is though is we've had 

137.03 143.16 B: we don't want like china to come after us or we're like totally fucked like seriously [laughter] 

142.31 148.01 A: but we have treaties with so many people and you know they fail all the time 

147.81 148.78 B: yeah 

148.02 154.97 A: like north korea i mean they weren't supposed to do weapons of mass des- destruction and they are so i don't know that 

155.24 158.41 A: really treaties would help with bioterrorism 

159.19 164.00 A: i think um bioterrorism goes mainly to the core of the 

164.10 165.18 A: um 

166.59 178.63 A: you know the the um people that wanna do us harm the hamas the [sigh] uh saddam hussein um who's not there any more hopefully but you know the al qaeda 

176.30 177.26 B: [laughter] 

178.49 179.60 B: right [noise] 

178.70 180.83 A: and all those type of people 

181.75 183.58 A: and um [sigh] 

184.08 185.56 A: you know i think 

185.87 190.02 A: you know they should get countries though to destroy their um 

190.78 195.77 A: [noise] their caches of of bio- bioterrorism stuff 

195.84 202.26 B: yeah definitely and things should like that should just be destroyed or disposed of however like properly 

200.46 201.87 A: [noise] because 

202.06 206.30 A: because see that's where it can be stolen and then used you know 

206.82 210.08 A: [sigh] in the terrorist world [sigh] which 

208.91 216.36 B: yeah they shouldn't even invent that stuff [laughter] you know that would be a great start but hey it's already happened so 

211.85 213.08 A: [laughter] 

215.92 221.65 A: well anthrax has [noise] you know i mean it it's a naturally i mean 

221.71 227.73 A: cows have had anthrax forever and i mean it's you know something that's always been there [sigh] 

227.27 236.31 B: yeah and there's a rock group named anthrax [laughter] yeah there's a there back in the eighties there was like a hard rock group called anthrax 

230.33 231.92 A: oh i didn't know that 

235.53 240.88 A: [noise] oh okay that's that's that's weird but that's interesting 

236.40 244.60 B: [laughter] yeah yeah i know [laughter] but hey you learn something new every day [laughter] 

243.39 246.34 A: [laughter] but um 

245.15 249.62 B: [sigh] yeah other than that like i can't think of much anything else i would 

249.46 262.18 B: [noise] like do on bioterrorism maybe like what see i think like the next thing that they're gonna do are like poison animals and stuff and then like household pets like cats and whatnot could just like scratch you 

262.35 271.58 B: and then all of a sudden you got like whatever it has like i don't know i think they could spread disease easily through animals like through their like food and everything 

265.77 266.67 A: [noise] 

271.59 272.56 B: i don't know 

271.78 274.14 A: um i don't know i think they could 

273.07 277.06 B: that's a little farfetched but hey i can't i think it might be possible 

276.58 280.65 A: i think they could spread it more likely through the food that they import 

280.10 286.47 B: and how 'bout they yeah they should definitely watch the water surpr- the water supply and watch the roads more 

286.29 294.59 A: [noise] right i think they're doing the water supply you know in most places i think they're watching it pretty closely yeah 

286.51 288.44 B: that'd probably be a good thing 

292.45 293.56 B: really 

293.62 295.46 B: oh i hope to god so [laughter] 

295.13 296.64 A: [laughter] 

296.18 299.77 B: i don't know in ohio everybody was really paranoid like 

299.62 314.52 B: oh man it it was but the thing is it was a lot different in ohio what everybody's reaction was to what happened than it is here in new york you know it's much sadder here in new york 'cause it affects people still every day and in ohio it was just 

313.61 314.95 A: right 

314.63 323.08 B: some kind of like you know thing wh- it it was there it went by but everybody's still like paranoid about it but y- you know 

323.27 328.58 B: i don't know but i don't think anybody in ohio really has to worry you know i hate to say that i mean 

328.70 331.67 B: but i don't see why they would attack like ohio 

332.06 335.87 A: [cough] well supposedly saint louis was on the hit list 

335.29 338.71 B: mhm a lot of major cities were 

336.26 337.47 A: so
