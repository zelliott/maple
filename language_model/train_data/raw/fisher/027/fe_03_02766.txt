130.44 141.08 B: well i don't think so i think i changed [laughter] i don't thing they changed the rules but it's just i think baseball is just so slow i can't hardly stand it 

132.66 134.16 A: [laughter] 

139.54 141.19 A: and you used to love it 

141.73 142.66 B: so 

142.05 143.81 A: and you used to enjoy it though 

143.72 153.82 B: i did i did it's really very strange because i was barely here and i got hooked on dodgers and yankees playing 

144.47 146.07 A: (( that is strange )) 

153.51 154.34 A: oh 

154.01 158.82 B: and ah and i always rooted for the dodgers 'cause they were the underdogs 

157.97 159.09 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

159.34 170.16 B: but i you know then when my kids weren't little and they wanted to play it was just punishment sitting there and watching because it was so boring and i'd forgotten the rules and 

167.74 169.24 A: (( oh dear )) 

169.51 171.68 A: (( even when your own children were playing )) 

171.72 177.77 B: even when my own children i just i pretended i smiled and pretended [laughter] 

172.31 174.01 A: [laughter] 

176.13 187.56 A: [laughter] ah i my the last company i worked for they had a softball league and i went to watch one of their softball games and i was so i was so bored though i wound 

183.83 185.99 B: yeah it's the same yeah 

186.62 187.76 B: oh you too 

188.10 195.31 A: up i was i was reading a book on my palm pilot and i got caught they found out that i wasn't really watching i just 

194.37 195.90 B: [laughter] 

195.39 196.63 A: [laughter] 

196.48 200.57 B: well i don't know how we got this topic right it's just that it's 

199.12 200.70 A: no 

200.60 201.76 B: not our 

202.08 204.27 B: it's not our main interest 

203.67 206.99 A: (( it's not at all no i mean i think um )) 

205.29 206.40 B: yeah 

207.32 210.38 A: my husband probably watches a little bit of 

210.51 222.40 A: support well he's he doesn't really like the team sports he likes things like skateboarding and so on i think um e._s._p._n. two i think they have some of those like x. games and stuff like that so no 

215.92 217.68 B: oh i see 

219.54 221.13 B: yeah yeah 

221.15 228.84 B: yeah my my husband's not a big sports enthusiast either because we feel like it's out of hand 

228.19 229.33 A: mhm 

228.70 243.05 B: you know it it's i mean it's rude and and you know even on on the school high school level the kids it got so that the parents would get so upset that their kids didn't get to play and 

240.64 241.72 A: (( oh yeah )) 

243.21 247.12 B: especially in this country i think it's just insane 

247.25 248.56 A: yeah 

248.10 250.55 B: ah i mean sports is so 

250.95 256.08 B: plays so high up and so literally worshipped you know 

255.59 256.55 A: yeah 

256.99 262.56 B: and ah i just we just both really find if kind of offensive [laughter] 

261.72 269.17 A: yeah i i guess i feel well i mean i i've never been a big sports fan even in england and in england soccer's a big deal 

268.00 271.31 B: yeah soccer well it's getting big here but you know 

270.24 278.16 A: yeah but the whole competitive thing you know the the doing down of the losers and the and the 

278.36 283.33 A: extreme pride in i just don't like that kind of way it divides people i 

282.83 285.54 B: yes yes exactly 

284.61 292.04 A: feel like society's sort of ah aggressive enough without sort of having our our leisures that way 

289.05 290.83 B: oh absolutely 

290.98 303.93 B: and from what things i've seen 'specially i think in like ah south america and stuff where they you know where soccer is where and italy and where they just literally i mean people die 

303.90 305.23 A: oh yeah 

304.61 316.01 B: i mean if that isn't the craziest thing they run in to the fields and and they hurt people and ah the violence is i i just 

316.28 320.08 B: i it just really makes me ill [laughter] 

318.99 320.13 A: yeah 

320.27 328.48 A: no i mean i like i mean i don't know i think we probably had a bigger problem with violence at sports events in england than here in the u._s. but um 

328.01 329.50 B: really in england 

329.23 337.90 A: oh yeah football hooliganism soccer hooliganism yeah they have they have gangs of supporters that will like they'll arrange to meet up for fights before 

336.69 344.04 B: [mn] i never knew that i thought it's mostly like you hear in argentina and in italy i didn't know that england had that 

340.99 342.30 A: no 

343.37 347.59 A: oh yes there was now where was it in belgium there were some deaths 

347.83 350.48 A: and that was um i think there was 

350.49 355.30 A: associated with fighting between english fans and and belgian fans 

355.03 357.07 B: oh for heaven's sake 

355.99 362.73 A: yeah so uh it's everywhere so i mean i guess the one thing about u._s. sports is that it tends to be 

362.71 371.23 A: more a family kind of thing like you go to a football game or i don't know i've always see a lot of children i've been to a few of the games live 

369.66 371.75 B: oh yes oh yes 

371.58 375.57 A: um so i mean that's good except that the whole uh 

373.35 374.36 B: yeah 

375.61 377.28 A: adversarial thing 

377.01 383.01 B: yeah it is that's true no they do take kids i mean we look at it even ah in 

383.05 394.63 B: at nebraska at the university when they have the home games and you see how many children are there and we are actually totally aghast because you can't even get tickets for nebraska football 

386.44 387.41 A: mhm 

394.56 403.45 B: and so people have season tickets and then they take little kids and pay for those i mean enormous amount of money even if you 

398.89 399.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

403.50 405.44 B: if you have ah 

405.47 406.36 B: i mean 

406.91 421.65 B: just not anybody can get a ticket and it's just impossible here and ah and so they take little kids and my husband and i just always wonder why you would waste a ticket to nebraska football game on a little kid [laughter] 

408.55 410.17 A: no no 

419.81 425.93 A: wow i i don't know i guess some people they live for the sports don't they so they just think 

424.10 437.55 B: oh they do they do and i think they want to encourage their children to be really sports oriented and it takes such precedence over education that ah that i think i find that very very upsetting 

429.39 431.66 A: that's right yeah 

434.33 435.25 A: oh 

437.01 438.38 A: yeah 

437.82 442.98 B: you know 'cause there's all the money in the world for sports but there isn't to pay good teachers 

442.35 456.55 A: that's right and then then you've got the other thing that i find bizarre and i'm not quiet sure if this is on topic or not but um the sports scholarships to the colleges and so on it's so expensive to go to college but you can get in if you're good at sports and ah 

451.63 452.60 B: (( yeah )) 

455.78 456.63 B: yes 

456.50 463.96 A: and that's i guess because there's so much money in sports and the universities need to promote that yeah 

461.29 465.12 B: they want to get the best players so they offer them everything yeah 

464.07 465.24 A: (( yeah )) 

465.22 475.43 B: and so many of them never graduate they get i think it's on topic because they if they're really good they get drafted into the professional 

474.95 475.93 A: yeah 

475.35 482.70 B: sports and then you know after they're done because your body can only work do this for so long 

482.12 483.57 A: mhm 

482.94 486.69 B: and then what do they have they have no education 

486.63 498.38 B: you know you read always about people that were big in sports and now they're into drugs and doing all kinds of things i i just don't i just think it's overrated and overpaid and 

492.66 493.68 A: mhm 

498.32 505.77 B: you know they get millions of dollars and they pay two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to be president you know 

505.51 506.72 A: [laughter] 

505.79 508.51 B: [laughter] to to me that's 

507.30 508.31 A: yeah 

508.71 513.52 B: you know the responsibility there and for a sports person 

513.98 516.39 B: (( how could you even compare that )) 

515.78 526.99 A: i don't know but i mean i guess it's the market isn't it if people are prepared to pay these enormous prices and things and i mean even these pay per view sporting events i mean i just i can't imagine i think 

519.47 520.32 B: (( yeah )) 

521.79 523.28 B: that's right 

526.64 528.24 B: i can't either 

527.46 537.78 A: i went to a friend's house once and he was having a party and i think it there was a boxing match on or something that he had paid for i wonder if it was maybe it was tyson or some big deal 

533.64 534.55 B: uh-huh 

537.00 538.62 B: yeah yeah 

537.97 542.25 A: so i mean he had everybody round to see this thing but um 

541.09 542.06 B: right 

542.41 546.23 A: oh i can't ever imagine ever finding money to pay for 

545.66 555.08 B: no me neither [laughter] no and then especially in in boxing and then sometimes it's over in a few seconds 

546.86 548.84 A: (( for that on t._v. no )) 

554.30 555.71 A: oh yeah 

555.11 558.97 B: and you've paid what seventy eighty dollars 

559.55 562.12 B: on pay per view to watch it 

560.80 565.22 A: but there must be plenty of people that do it i just [laughter] 

564.15 574.79 B: well obviously there is there is but ah it's ah you know it's it's it's beyond my ah my understanding [laughter] 

572.95 580.61 A: yeah mine too oh well i hope they get some other people on the phones that actually watch some of these ah [laughter] events 

579.14 586.73 B: well that's true but then this is a different kind of discussion than it is when ah so i think have you been doing this long 

582.45 583.79 A: that's right 

586.58 588.89 A: no today was the day i signed up 

588.45 599.00 B: well that's what i did and i didn't quite they said well you'd get a call soon and um and it sounded to me like it's only three calls total isn't it 

589.96 591.03 A: (( ah )) 

598.38 599.89 A: (( um i'm not s- ))
