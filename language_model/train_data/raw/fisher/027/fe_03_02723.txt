52.99 54.37 B: totally 

54.46 61.56 B: i mean and i think you know they can only do so much in terms of we have a national guard which was creepy i'm sure just 

60.79 65.55 A: yeah wasn't it seeing seeing people with like rifles in their hand what's with that 

63.59 71.82 B: yeah i was like oh my god like you totally can't get used to it like you turn the corner in the subway and there's a guy with a rifle i'm like jesus christ

70.82 77.96 A: and washington square the stop there was two guys with rifles and it's like it's like unreal it's kinda surreal 

73.74 75.08 B: yeah 

77.57 86.95 B: it it's like a future like a movie from the future like is this really my city and i mean i think that's really all you can do and who knows i mean if that's even preventative of anything you know 

79.73 80.62 A: yeah 

87.00 95.21 B: like i'm sure it cuts down on random thugs and stuff like that but in terms of something huge i mean these people plan for years you know 

94.62 98.81 A: yeah [laughter] yeah they do and they're very subtle what they the way they work 

95.83 97.00 B: yeah 

98.21 107.15 B: and that's the sick part i mean it's sad but if i don't know in terms of just government stuff you know in terms of what they can do [laughter] like admit futility i guess 

107.08 110.06 A: i know well they can't they can't ever do that though 

110.07 113.37 A: on this they gotta keep the comp- 

113.42 116.86 A: country kind of like feeling i think they're not that bad 

116.25 117.96 B: yeah exactly and they 

117.17 119.09 A: although although they way they keep 

119.33 122.14 A: you know they keep pressing on in other countries [laughter] 

121.18 123.19 B: mhm [laughter] 

122.32 125.60 A: you know i think sometimes they're just gonna make it worse you know 

124.88 134.36 B: yeah i know our popularity rating isn't that high right now i'm sure after everything that's happened i mean what's up with the war right now i mean it's basically over right 

129.53 130.34 A: yeah 

133.76 136.77 A: yeah but i think uh they're making sounds about syria 

136.21 139.05 B: oh really oh my gosh 

136.87 137.96 A: yeah 

138.54 141.30 A: well i think everybody expected that i think that 

141.31 144.34 A: it was more an excuse to the 

144.58 149.10 A: you know make sure you're you're oil rights are right there and i think control everything down there 

147.20 148.36 B: mhm 

148.56 149.92 B: yeah 

149.19 151.19 A: so that's what's gonna happen 

150.97 160.61 B: that's isn't this funny i mean the whole the only thing i got from this was in terms of now trying to link saddam hussain and september eleventh and like conveniently forgetting about bin laden and all his little lackeys [laughter] 

159.16 165.81 A: yeah it's like he wasn't convicted at all didn't even find any any weapons over there 

163.11 164.47 B: exactly 

165.20 170.94 B: mhm now it's like oh but they have oil over there so we've got to drag them into it somehow [laughter] 

170.03 172.55 A: i know it's the country's really weird 

171.97 180.41 B: it's depressing it's like i hate to be one of those people that are just like oh i don't wanna talk about it i don't want to hear about but i mean when you're just trying to live your day to day life it's like 

179.58 188.01 A: yeah you know i mean every- everything is going up the rent's going up the trains going up taxes are going up i mean and people are laid off left and right 

183.92 185.06 B: mhm 

187.25 194.29 B: yeah oh that's right hey today was the day that the tokens were supposed to go up right did it happen because i know they were trying to do a last minute 

190.57 191.68 A: (( yeah today )) 

193.67 199.52 A: yeah they they lost [sigh] they lost the fight to to uh stop it and now they're trying to 

197.93 198.53 B: (( ooh )) 

199.56 210.44 A: get a rollback going but i don't think it's gonna i think it's gonna hap- i think i think the way the country is that the corporations say this is the way it's gonna be and that's the way it's it's gonna be from now on 

200.75 201.95 B: really 

208.09 213.38 B: yeah it's what we get for having like a billionaire mayor god i hate 

212.06 215.27 A: yeah well you know i don't i 

215.56 217.90 A: know it's it's terrible the the way he is but 

217.30 218.32 B: mhm 

218.20 222.22 A: he was left with a lot of it i think i think he was left with a really big bill 

221.84 228.68 B: that's the truth i mean i know like everyone's like so high on guiliani for god knows what reason but he did screw up yeah 

225.84 228.19 A: yeah yeah guiliani was not that great 

228.82 242.38 B: i mean i appreciate what he did crime wise 'cause i do truly feel like the city was safer in his years but in terms of yeah just to have a sit in money it does seem like it you know it's not like the mayor would want everyone to hate him and raise the tokens [laughter] you know 

233.71 234.70 A: (( yeah )) 

241.51 242.30 A: right 

242.41 246.30 A: god forbid something should happen with a a chemical thing right now or bioterrorism 

245.68 250.13 B: i just we would completely be incapacitated i mean the whole thing would be shut down 

248.14 249.18 A: yeah i mean 

249.83 252.20 A: right you know they did that in japan though 

251.82 254.73 B: that's what i was thinking yeah that was 

252.44 253.87 A: (( yeah and )) 

254.03 256.45 A: korea with that guy with that little firebomb 

256.15 260.28 B: yeah i remember seeing that on the news and just being like oh my god 

259.96 266.18 A: well what you i mean what would you do if if something like that happened you know like any tips of how to avoid it or 

264.54 273.46 B: [laughter] no that's the thing like you know the only thing i know they were talking about what were those pills that were so big last year was it the um 

266.92 267.86 A: (( [laughter] no )) 

272.80 274.57 A: (( oh oh the anthrax )) 

274.03 278.25 B: mhm like but you'd have to take it beforehand like if if 

274.73 275.65 A: yeah 

278.00 279.01 A: (( yeah )) 

278.39 286.52 B: yeah was it pro- i'm trying to remember the name of it because i know they were selling it on the internet whatever it was like a cautionary pill that if you took it if you were exposed you'd be okay 

283.94 284.85 A: yeah 

286.61 292.09 B: yeah i can't even imagine like if you're in the train and like suddenly weird gas is pouring in or just this 

291.27 292.52 A: yeah what do you do 

292.45 301.61 B: [mn] panic [laughter] 'cause that's the thing you can have your contingency plans but when it comes down to it i mean you just go into survival mode it's 

293.81 295.02 A: [laughter] 

297.52 298.31 A: right 

300.83 301.97 A: yeah you do 

301.82 306.23 B: yeah it's sad to say but that's pretty much what it boils down to 

302.13 303.79 A: um 

305.44 310.97 A: if people can just if you can keep i think your head calm and just quietly move towards the exits you 

308.73 309.82 B: mhm 

310.67 311.92 B: yeah 

311.34 313.79 A: know even if people are like running crazy 

313.34 327.67 B: yeah 'cause that's the thing and then it gets into just the ugly side of human nature i mean you see the rush hour people just shoving through to get on the train i'm like god forbid there was a panic everybody just freaks out it's just so creepy to think like especially the trains that go under the water 

319.61 320.54 A: (( right right )) 

322.28 323.07 A: yeah 

327.73 332.10 B: you know like oh god you don't even want to think about explosions under there 

327.77 329.42 A: (( oh man [laughter] )) 

331.90 332.81 A: right 

332.46 335.32 B: but yeah it would totally shut down the city 

334.34 339.08 A: do you think the rest of the country is is as scared about bioterrorism as as we are in new york yeah 

338.45 345.38 B: i don't think so honestly no i think that we're just such a huge target like us on the west coast 

344.96 346.09 A: yeah 

345.48 350.31 B: you know the only and disneyland apparently [laughter] i know that was like on the list 

348.30 349.50 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

350.06 351.13 A: [laughter] 

350.48 364.98 B: but i think you know as much as unless you've really lived here and lived through september eleventh here you just can't know how it is you know just in terms of trying to get back to your normal life after it happened it was just it was all i mean i don't know about you but it's like all you thought about for the next few weeks 

357.23 358.44 A: right right 

364.39 366.27 A: right all you could smell 

365.69 372.26 B: yeah exactly yeah so i don't think they can really identify with the country and i mean that just 

372.30 376.86 B: i can't imagine iowa being like a major target you know [laughter] unless you 

375.15 378.04 A: right you know colorado they get that big one 

377.85 378.83 B: what's that 

378.85 380.87 A: colorado was it colorado 

381.27 383.39 A: they got that federal building exploded 

383.44 386.28 B: oh where was was that oklahoma city 

385.94 388.63 A: oklahoma city not in colorado right 

386.64 387.81 B: yeah 

388.00 397.46 B: that was just apparen- well so they say he was just some crazy little you know like supremacist but who knows i mean there's like a ton of like government conspiracies about him too 

391.78 392.63 A: yeah 

397.05 400.36 A: yes so it's like the inside people and the outside people want to get us [laughter] 

399.94 404.68 B: exactly yeah it's like so we're basically we're screwed either way [laughter] 

403.76 416.44 A: well i'm i'm sure there's there's um certainty if you could do a like um to protect yourself from like something that happens you know what i mean there's little tips and stuff like that maybe like on the internet or maybe someone makes a little book and makes some money of that 

411.10 412.16 B: mhm 

415.88 417.48 B: (( yeah right there you go )) 

416.75 418.05 A: (( you know there you go )) 

418.07 422.09 B: i know they talked about what was it putting plastic in your windows for some sort of 

420.93 429.84 A: right well yeah i don't think that'll work [laughter] 'cause so many people's apartments are just not not really especially in new york they're really like seals proof you know i 

422.66 424.62 B: [laughter] 

428.40 430.81 B: mhm exactly 

429.95 431.95 A: mean i have cracks all over the place 

431.71 444.69 B: yeah that's the thing it's like there's gonna be somehow it's gonna like sneak in ew just the thought of it but yeah i don't really know any real tips or anything else just what i've seen on the news you know people running out and buying the gas masks that's all that's really 

443.66 449.26 A: well you know they did try you know they did tests and stuff in in the new york subway systems a long a long time ago 

449.15 450.73 B: (( what do you mean the )) 

449.83 452.79 A: they they tested like bioterrorism stuff and they 

451.91 453.24 B: did they really 

452.90 460.87 A: yeah they they kinda like they picked like a population and they just like put stuff in the trains to see if it'll like spread 

460.27 461.72 B: oh my god 

461.07 464.76 A: well that's back then when they used to do stuff like that like the sixties and seventies 

464.06 465.77 B: yeah 

465.15 466.82 A: and so 

467.44 470.46 A: we've survived that 

468.73 471.73 B: yeah that's like the or something you know like 

470.60 472.95 A: (( yeah that's it exactly so )) 

472.16 473.90 B: oh creepy 

473.63 474.74 A: yeah 

474.16 476.11 B: how did you hear about that was it 

475.51 483.65 A: it was another thing about the state they talk about the radiation and they talk about bioterrorism and they said that yes they uh the government did test stuff during you know 

478.92 479.83 B: mhm 

483.24 484.55 B: wow 

483.99 486.27 A: they test how much radiation people can take 

485.68 486.99 B: yeah 

486.28 490.31 A: and they they basically like they i know they took one school where 

490.40 492.21 A: they put all this uh 

492.62 501.46 A: this radiative material in the basement and then they had the kids walk through it like everyday [laughter] and then they tested 'em you know they like kept a track of 'em or something like that 

494.61 495.69 B: mhm 

495.99 499.01 B: [mn] oh my god holy hell 

500.57 501.90 B: yeah 

501.61 503.43 A: so all that kind of stuff and 

503.04 514.89 B: wow i mean i heard something about homeless people showing up and setting off radiation detectors like i heard something about that somewhere where they were just finding like dead homeless people and they were setting off radiation and what you know how the hell that happened 

507.70 508.59 A: yeah 

514.39 516.01 A: (( that's yeah it's not good )) 

515.01 517.28 B: i wonder if that could somehow be connected 

517.12 529.37 A: yeah well what they did they're not supposed to really do that any more but i know that they they had tests and stuff like that because i don't think they knew there was you know remember when they had all those tests and they had all these like troops behind there and they all got radiated 

526.53 528.74 B: mhm exactly yeah 

528.91 535.22 B: then they find out years later like ooh that probably wasn't such a good idea [laughter] that's just so creepy i mean 

531.84 533.08 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

534.48 536.91 A: and all the sands in the desert in nevada that's 

536.24 537.57 B: yeah 

537.61 539.59 A: (( the the world we live in )) 

537.62 538.87 B: wow 

539.23 543.29 B: i know right it's like great place to raise your kids [laughter] 

542.14 543.40 A: (( i know i know )) 

543.19 553.01 B: god it's so depressing and it's hard not to get completely paranoid i mean after all the different you know stories that came out after september eleven and even the war now i mean about what's really going on 

551.05 551.81 A: right 

552.90 559.01 B: it's it's like who can you really you know know what to believe and what's just crazy stuff forwarded to you on the internet 

559.50 561.08 A: it's it's it's 

561.14 571.10 A: right now i i just think the next few years i mean it's kind of calm right now but i think the way the country's going the way there are going to be a lot of more more poor people who are going to angrier yeah 

565.21 566.32 B: mhm 

570.75 577.47 B: that's what it seems like i mean even when you look at just if you just take manhattan in terms of what it costs to actually live there 

576.45 588.04 A: yeah and what is that about i mean you're just pushing everybody out and now now they have this thing where uh there was a law before where all the new new apartment buildings even like the ritzy ones had to set aside like a certain percentage for like lower incomes 

585.26 586.27 B: mhm 

587.48 589.04 B: oh right yeah 

588.41 592.97 A: and they totally brought out of that law now they they can buy themselves out themselves out of it yeah and it's 

591.32 593.87 B: (( really i didn't know about that )) 

593.42 595.96 A: yeah it it was passed like a couple of weeks ago 

595.48 599.89 B: oh that sucks 'cause i know like one of my friends is on a list for that and i'm like 

599.50 599.89 A: (( yeah ))
