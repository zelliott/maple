26.63 28.29 B: mhm 

27.41 28.63 A: [sigh] um 

28.74 33.35 A: i guess if i had to pick one i probably would pick boxing 

33.09 36.31 B: boxing that's a pretty interesting sport 

36.64 39.24 A: i like that because you can um 

39.36 46.72 A: you know you can see everything that's going on when i watch football or baseball or something like that the picture's so foreshortened that i don't get any 

47.10 53.32 A: i don't get any sense of being there you know it it's just like i don't know it's like watching cartoons 

53.30 60.16 B: right and i think it's also a different for me anyway there's a different feeling in watching it than actually being there 

59.92 61.36 A: (( but uh i know )) 

60.62 65.07 B: i think when you're there you're involved with the crowd and cheering 

65.03 69.18 A: [mn] yeah there's no excitement looking at the flat screen it's 

68.63 70.48 B: right [laughter] 

69.99 74.15 A: [laughter] do you watch like in sports bars and that kind of thing at all

76.13 77.69 A: [mn] yeah 

81.55 87.52 B: like i placed bets before on football games but i'm really not into football whatsoever 

86.30 95.63 A: you you're looking for the score probably whenever [laughter] [laughter] see i can i can watch a football game a high school football game and enjoy it 

88.24 90.52 B: right just to see if i'm gonna win [laughter] 

95.53 97.34 B: right

103.39 103.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

104.26 110.35 A: [laughter] this is a really unfortunate topic [laughter]

116.77 118.78 A: i live in mississippi 

118.90 125.83 A: and so our college games are not typically televised um once in a while there'll be something that's on

185.18 186.44 A: and um 

187.27 193.69 A: that's the only new you know it's the same old stuff over and over but soccer has hit our town big time 

194.26 196.41 A: (( [lipsmack] and everybody's in soccer so )) 

195.87 200.65 B: [laughter] now do you have different sports for each season like

203.12 204.93 B: mhm 

207.24 208.96 B: yeah 

208.33 214.20 A: so and televised basketball i can't stand i i have to turn it off it makes me nervous 

213.67 216.60 B: [mn] how come you just don't like it 

214.52 220.14 A: it's the i don't like it because i actually am interested in that sport i actually like that sport 

220.10 234.31 A: and 'cause i understand what's going on but there's something about the the closed up look on the screen that it just the jerking back and forth from the long shots to the short shots just completely destroys the it's like watching a bad movie to me 

225.69 227.35 B: mhm 

234.15 241.12 B: right yeah and um your husband you said doesn't like it right 

235.11 236.87 A: (( i don't like that at all ))

249.02 258.82 A: [laughter] yeah we i have a brother in law that's addicted so when he comes we kind of we try to act like we're interested so he can watch you know 'cause he's like he watches every football game 

258.47 264.20 B: mhm and it's hard for people who don't like it and you're stuck with it [laughter] you know 

262.64 269.33 A: yeah yeah do y'all do the after holidays sitting down 'cause it's a tradition watching the game or

431.74 433.08 B: yep 

433.33 438.57 B: oh and the other thing we have to talk about do you have a um i know you don't like sports but um 

438.77 441.17 B: is there a favorite team in mississippi 

440.78 447.51 A: [mn] not at all not at all i graduated from old miss and and but everybody in my husband's family 

441.84 442.78 B: no 

447.57 450.30 A: went to a different out of state school 

449.92 451.38 B: mhm 

450.48 462.18 A: and uh one of them went to mississippi state here briefly but there i i just don't have any preference you know i just kinda like if they're from mississippi i'll pull for 'em since [laughter] we're so abused you know just let someone win 

459.94 462.87 B: [laughter] right mhm 

462.25 466.44 A: and we're in the same ci- have you ever heard of mississippi valley state university 

466.46 467.90 B: i think i have 

467.38 479.60 A: it's it's a black university the green machine and it's like one of the old traditional black schools well it's located here in my hometown so i'm always like pulling for valley you know i'm like always wanting valley to win 'cause it's you know hometown team 

471.80 472.81 B: mhm 

479.54 483.28 B: right and i think everyone feels like that when it's their hometown 

481.65 483.00 A: but they play 

483.02 487.30 A: and they play in a different a different group you know from old miss and that 

486.92 488.68 B: mhm 

487.53 488.78 A: so 

488.81 495.53 A: i probably pay more attention to that than i do to the others 'cause it's like right here and i know the kids that are playing and it's just more [sigh] 

495.04 496.81 B: right more exciting 

496.40 498.79 A: more exciting what about where you're from [mn] 

498.81 499.94 B: um 

500.12 503.92 B: see i'm really not into sports like i said but um 

504.27 507.65 B: the celtics are pretty good here like for basketball 

507.61 508.86 A: yeah 

508.10 513.56 B: and then it's like the home schools depending on what town you're from that's who you want to win 

511.82 512.49 A: yeah 

513.76 520.95 A: see now i pay attention to basketball 'cause it's like a soap opera with all the different stuff happening to the players and like every day you pick up the paper and somebody else 

520.15 521.83 B: oh you're reading something 

521.33 527.12 A: yeah [laughter] but i'm reading gossip instead of sports [laughter] is what what that problem is [sigh] 

522.01 522.99 B: (( yeah )) 

524.27 525.98 B: [laughter] 

526.33 530.98 B: i think that's with any kind of sport like football you hear about the football players wrestling 

530.80 532.42 A: yeah yeah yeah 

531.32 533.46 B: [mn] um boxing 

534.46 544.27 A: now wrestling is one that i'll turn off instantly i would unplug the t._v. if somebody tried to listen to wrestling on the television set i just i can't stand it [laughter] 

541.58 542.90 B: mhm 

544.54 546.62 A: have you ever watched it 

545.97 546.96 B: (( [laughter] no )) 

546.83 548.87 A: (( oh oh )) 

549.19 550.73 A: (( [sigh] it's i )) 

550.76 555.14 A: don't know it's that combination of bad acting and testosterone and 

555.21 560.36 A: [sigh] and it's crude and i just um i just can't tolerate wrestling 

561.14 563.11 A: i used to watch bowling 

563.55 567.04 B: [mn] [sigh] oh i consider that so boring [laughter] 

566.35 570.21 A: (( it is [laughter] it really is )) 

567.21 568.25 B: yeah 

569.92 573.65 B: [laughter] unless you're playing it then that's different 

572.62 581.70 A: i can remember watching bowling like on a black and white t._v. screen when i was a little kid i guess it must have been one of the early you know one of the early programs or something 

581.27 583.06 B: mhm 

581.87 588.56 A: but i do remember watching bowling as soon as i get on the phone it of course immediately begins to beep and my cell phone begins to [sigh] 

588.88 591.79 A: go crazy and nobody's needed me all morning [sigh] [laughter] 

591.11 592.09 B: [laughter] 

593.15 596.32 A: have you participated in any other studies like this 

596.11 598.84 B: no i haven't is this your first time 

598.45 599.89 A: (( uh-huh it is ))
