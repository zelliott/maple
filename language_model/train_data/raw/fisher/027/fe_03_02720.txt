6.32 9.08 A: okay hi i'm dayna i'm here in um atlanta 

9.06 14.73 B: [noise] [lipsmack] okay i guess the topic of the day is what the u._s. can do to prevent bioterrorism 

14.68 15.59 A: okay 

15.36 21.39 B: yeah i would say that they need to take stricter security on the borders 

21.70 23.31 B: and not let 

23.33 30.77 B: any foreigners in unless they can really prove you know who they are and why they're here and why they want to come here [noise] [noise] 

31.10 36.23 A: i would agree with that and i also think they should have um limits on how long they can be here 

36.40 38.38 A: unless they're here for a certain reason 

38.28 42.79 B: yes most i mean i think you know it's not being mean but with everything 

38.68 39.97 A: [laughter] 

42.82 51.57 B: going on they need to close the borders [noise] and have more security so they know who's actually coming in the country [noise] 

51.89 55.36 B: and they should also make some kind of law or something where 

51.91 52.81 A: right 

55.90 59.96 B: if you have middle eastern men or somebody suspicious that are going 

60.53 66.79 B: looking at the [noise] chemical plants or trying to take plane lessons that it's reported 

66.83 68.98 B: i mean it may sound mean but 

68.04 70.95 A: [noise] no no i don't yeah 

69.32 73.50 B: it's [noise] well after what we went through [noise] [laughter] i think it's safe to 

71.55 85.39 A: yeah uh especially here in new york yeah i would i would think so yeah i agree i mean i agree with all of that and i think that you know it's kinda and you know even though you hate to be profiling 'cause that's not right necessa- you still have to 

74.13 75.34 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

85.36 87.57 A: and like when i was at um 

87.45 92.90 A: the airport i mean they pulled me out of the crowd and i had to do the whole pat down it's embarrassing 

92.72 106.62 A: you know but i mean if that's the way it has to be you know and i i don't at all look [laughter] you know scary or anything but i was like oh okay you know that's um uh that's fair that was fine with me you know that's that's what you got to do 

97.44 100.37 B: [laughter] it all sounds though [noise] 

106.92 113.97 A: so i agree i think that they should um they that's what i think so too huh i think i m- it's going to have to be a lot more strict 

113.86 119.04 B: yeah i think when you go through the airports also they should have something where they can x ray 

119.12 124.84 B: [lipsmack] people walking through to make sure there's no chemicals or anything [noise] on them that's suspicious 

124.43 133.62 A: yeah more than yeah and they should pay them more to the screeners 'cause a lot of the screeners they get you know look like they just got out of prison themselves [laughter] so i don't 

132.35 135.58 B: [noise] yeah and so they really don't care what they let through 

134.13 145.41 A: yeah they don't care [laughter] they don't care i mean you know as long as they're getting you know their eight bucks an hour or whatever it is they get you know they don't act like they really care either now a lot of them are nice and that's being mean again too but 

145.44 149.65 A: you know maybe just more accountability too when they're lost 

149.71 151.03 B: [noise] and that's true 

149.74 156.78 A: you know [laughter] i mean what is this they know we have terrorists and they don't throw them out now [laughter] [laughter] 

155.61 167.04 B: [noise] no i mean it's yo- you know it's uh people they say it's mean that we shouldn't profile but i think every middle eastern person you have here their background should be checked 

166.93 168.21 A: yeah i agree 

167.43 170.69 B: because it can be your neighbour [cough] it can be anybody 

171.09 173.11 A: yeah and y- yeah i agree 

171.64 174.46 B: i mean we had it you know where we work they 

174.82 177.24 B: use um a middle eastern man 

177.33 180.08 B: to do the printing and we never had a problem with him 

179.94 181.16 A: (( mhm no )) 

180.54 185.33 B: and you know never always nice and then right after september eleventh yeah he hasn't 

185.44 190.96 B: i'll see you next month i'll burn the chronicles whatever and the man disappears and he sells the store [cough] 

190.74 200.82 B: you would think that uh you know you start getting suspicious 'cause he's been there five years and all of a sudden [noise] [cough] you know he doesn't say he's selling the store and he just disappears 

193.17 194.55 A: right 

200.15 201.66 A: yeah we had um 

201.99 209.90 A: we had people too that worked with me and we felt overly like we needed to protect them because we had a lot of people that were coming into our business 

209.90 224.00 A: being u- you know mean towards them and we had known them and they were fine to us [laughter] do you know what i mean we felt like oh well you know so we were like you know leave them alone they have nothing you know uh but then again you don't know and as mean as that sounds 

211.76 213.12 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

221.38 222.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] you don't )) 

223.91 236.04 A: you know and there's a lot of people that converted over also i mean look at the guy that just was in the army and he killed his own people [laughter] you know what i mean you don't know you don't know 

231.40 234.54 B: [noise] yeah it's true you don't know 

234.56 240.45 B: and until they get everything under control i mean we're not safe it can happen anywhere 

240.52 247.15 B: and i don't think giving out masks and you know saying okay well if this happens and giving 

247.85 253.93 B: [noise] i- immunization shots is going to do it they really need to get strict with who's coming in 

254.04 256.07 B: [noise] and why they're coming here 

256.02 256.91 A: right 

256.15 265.39 B: and they should have it okay well we have to prove that this is who you really say you are and this is why you're coming here or wha- wha- whatever reason 

265.65 272.43 A: right but they know of of so many now suspected terrorists so why are they still here 

272.27 274.44 B: [noise] [noise] yeah but i think also when 

272.59 276.17 A: why have they not rounded them up by now [laughter] and taken 'em away 

275.01 281.73 B: they probably can't find them i think that they you know it's a if you want to protect america you need to start showing us 

276.73 277.66 A: yeah 

281.79 285.17 B: pictures and saying this is who we're looking for 

285.14 286.46 A: right 

285.40 291.73 B: if you put enough pressure on them sooner or later they're going to flip up you're going to catch them before they can do anything 

291.36 292.66 A: true [mn] 

291.75 295.53 B: [noise] and i think we're too soft on them when we do catch them 

295.22 299.09 A: what do you think about the national i._d. card that they're thinking of coming out with 

299.93 305.50 A: that there's just an i._d. card that everyone has to have and if you're a citizen i agree with that 

302.20 304.59 B: [noise] i think they should [noise] 

304.82 313.17 B: because i mean [noise] people get mad and say well you know this is america we have freedom i mean i take the train everyday i don't live in manhattan thank god 

312.57 314.06 A: [laughter] 

313.34 319.07 B: but it's like you still you know you take a second look at people around you 

319.11 320.09 A: right 

319.83 322.33 B: (( and you think okay [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

321.51 336.46 A: yeah you really do i went to i was in new york and maybe just some the earlier you know at the end of well last year around christmas and i felt it was you know not living there i mean i can't imagine even living there you know i mean it seems my sister in law has m- m- lived in manhattan and i 

336.56 349.73 A: you know we were terrified when it happened and i just you know and immediately you'd start looking around you know at everybody and and um i just think that for a long time these same people have been going around saying how they were going to do all these things 

349.56 351.54 B: yeah but they and you know and that 

349.80 353.59 A: and so and you didn't believe it [laughter] 

351.83 357.47 B: no you didn't but i think that now that they actually know what they're capable of doing 

357.61 365.29 B: instead of saying well we're going after them we know where they are we're following them you need to stop letting them into the country 

364.82 366.07 A: [noise] yes i agree 

365.94 371.05 B: and stop helping them i mean they're not you know i mean i can understand pakistan 

367.72 369.44 A: yeah 

371.12 378.42 B: we're spending so much money to help them rebuild but you need to take care of your own people here first 

378.21 379.24 A: right 

378.62 381.61 B: before you do anything for them because 

381.88 386.52 B: you don't know i mean when you're brainwashed to believe that america's no good 

386.32 387.25 A: right 

386.73 394.37 B: you grow up to be like that and you think you're doing something good you don't care about how many people you're killing and i just hope 

388.89 390.40 A: mhm 

394.58 398.43 B: that they do something before we have another attack somewhere 

398.28 403.03 A: i do too and i think it'll be chemical if they do something i think it's going to be something like that 

400.73 408.50 B: yes i- it would be i think that would be easier for them to get away [noise] with that i mean they can put it you know leave it at the airport 

404.39 405.27 A: right 

405.73 406.88 A: mhm 

408.82 416.96 B: y- you should have it if people don't want body checks fine but some kinda x ray where you can see if they have little vials or anything on them 

416.56 418.11 A: mhm 

417.04 421.95 B: 'cause that's so easy you know if you take a little vial you can hide it anywhere [noise] [noise] 

421.34 435.52 A: right and they're going to have to they're going to have to do some profiling they just are uh and whenever they they uh uh i- you know and if they wanna throw a few people in just to make everybody feel better that's fine [laughter] you know i'll be the one you know they can take me at my turn but 

434.92 436.54 B: (( [noise] [laughter] you know i mean this )) 

435.66 442.07 A: you know just to make a but i mean they're going to have to i mean they don't have to come right out with it and say we're going to be doing you know just 

441.52 445.38 B: and don't say what you're doing but put it into a fact 

444.78 452.50 A: exactly i don't have to know that's fine but yeah i agree they they were going to have to and um with the borders i mean they're coming in 

452.52 458.50 A: you know from canada they're coming in from mexico i mean they're coming in from everywhere you know so 

457.22 466.26 B: [noise] and they just you know they they even said at the borders that these i._d.s are so fake that you cannot tell 

466.29 477.70 B: [noise] it's hard to really tell that they had fake ids [noise] but i think if you would have something on an i._d. that you know the public doesn't know about but when you put it through say a scanner or something 

469.63 470.94 A: right 

477.53 479.50 A: right yeah 

477.80 481.78 B: you could tell it's a real one then you can weed out the fake ones [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

481.18 490.18 A: you're right i agree i think so i think that we have to do that but here in the south i don't know if it's up like that up up north but we have we have so many um 

490.20 503.89 A: illegal aliens here it's um it's a joke do you know what i mean [laughter] i mean there are we have like huge cities here where everything's in hispanic or everything's in so i mean you know i mean obviously we don't have a problem letting them in [laughter] you know but i- it i 

493.61 495.65 B: yeah we have them here too 

502.99 505.64 B: it's true though i mean people get 

504.45 508.41 A: think it should be fair they're gonna have to be fair it's going to have to be everybody 

506.88 511.36 B: you know very mad when you say something i mean 

511.63 515.04 B: i don't like to say we're white women though we are but you know 

513.92 516.10 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

514.89 527.38 B: and we have a lot of hindus and pakistan and you know you see it you don't want to stare at them but it's just you don't what what you're saying okay you know we have a man by the train that sells the paper 

527.52 534.06 B: and he's got the thing on turban on his head and he he even must have been afraid 'cause he covers it up 

534.14 535.16 A: yeah 

534.27 546.10 B: when that happened and you know you see okay well you're right by the train and here he is [laughter] with a thing on his head who are they going to sympathize with they could've been born here but they have family over there 

535.28 536.31 A: yeah 

543.75 551.31 A: oh yeah and a lot of them are a lot of them are they stay in communities together they're just like you know i mean they're you know they 

546.23 548.13 B: [noise] you know and they have 

551.96 558.05 A: uh we uh we try to be nice to everyone but you still look and i think that that's the government's job 

557.95 572.06 A: it's their job to make sure that everything's safe here and the yeah it mean i think the i._d. card and i think th- the borders again and i think it's a fair to everyone you know if you're uh i mean you know protect people that live here too you 

566.97 569.27 B: [noise] [noise] it is i mean 

572.00 574.33 A: know they live here [laughter]
