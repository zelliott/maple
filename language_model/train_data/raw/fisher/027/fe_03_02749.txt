117.16 129.50 B: you know i uh you know i i'm in san francisco so naturally i'll i'll root for the niners but you know [laughter] when they're when they're out of the playoff let's go you know see what whoever else is around huh that that plays 

125.45 126.40 A: yeah 

128.48 137.66 A: oh yeah that's right well you guys have two teams to root for but how how did it how did it play out there when the raiders moved and then moved back again 

137.76 146.73 B: you know the the oakland fans are quite diehard fans um you know without soun- trying to sound elitist or anything oak- oakland is a pretty 

146.86 152.45 B: working sort of you know blue collar working town and there's a lot of people who 

150.18 151.09 A: mhm 

152.53 164.72 B: you know i mean they they were upset that you know when they moved you know oakland the raiders moved down to l._a. i i assume some of them might have followed but then when they came back it was like nothing had 

164.84 167.69 B: had happened and they've been raiders fan all 

167.54 180.73 B: raiders fans all their lives i mean i don't know if you've caught um you know some of the oakland games that were televised uh nationally but uh you know oakland oakland fans tend to be extremely rowdy uh 

179.89 182.77 A: that's the way well the eagles fans have that reputation 

180.91 182.05 B: right 

182.23 184.60 B: yeah yeah so [laughter] 

183.09 184.09 A: and that 

184.12 194.27 A: we used to have uh we used to have season tickets at the at the vet uh up in the nose bleed seats and that's where of course are the cheap seats and that's where all the drunks sit 

190.21 192.02 B: oh wow [laughter] okay 

193.69 195.33 B: [laughter] 

194.60 208.91 A: and every you know there would always be some poor unfortunate person that wore a red skins jacket or a new york giants you know shirt and by the fourth quarter literally you'd see them walking out of there after getting pummeled they'd be they'd have to leave 

200.44 201.84 B: (( [laughter] oh man )) 

208.52 210.49 B: [laughter] 

209.53 219.11 A: and the eagles are moving to a brand new stadium next year and the concern in town is that some of the rowdiness is gonna be replaced by corporate types 

218.73 220.22 B: (( ah okay )) 

219.22 228.88 A: you know in luxury boxes and 'cause the stadium's supposed to be fantastic it's it's the you know they've they've they've put in every touch you can think of well 

227.51 230.19 B: like state of the art kinda yeah 

229.49 231.61 A: actually they're building two stadiums here 

231.32 232.53 B: oh okay 

231.87 238.02 A: they're knocking down the vet and they're building this uh one stadium for the eagles and one stadium for the phillies 

237.66 242.19 B: wow well that sounds they're and they're both located in downtown 

238.49 239.43 A: which is 

242.11 252.65 A: well they're they're in um they're not in the center of town but they're about um they're right at the edge of the city the city is uh on the delaware river 

245.93 246.72 B: right 

252.32 253.24 B: okay 

252.84 258.99 A: and right at the edge of the river is where the vet was and now they're putting two stadiums sort of within 

259.14 265.74 A: you know like uh you could probably uh throw a rock from one and hit the other one they're very close to each other 

263.97 267.50 B: oh okay wow wow that's great 

266.83 271.67 A: and there was some controversy about you know spending that kind of money to build two stadiums 

271.24 278.68 B: yeah yeah well we got a new relatively new i think it's about like two years old uh baseball stadium 

277.76 279.37 A: yeah that's a nice park 

278.78 283.06 B: yeah it's a beautiful i don't know if you've ever been out to san francisco before but 

281.55 282.42 A: no 

283.01 296.27 B: it's like right on the water and uh you know on the on the upper level seats you know well i don't i don't i don't know which way i mean you know i don't i'm not a huge baseball fan i'll catch it on t._v. or whatnot but i've been in the stadium 

296.40 306.77 B: due to uh you know some party [sigh] that they had um and the higher level you are and even in the better i mean if if you're calling it nose bleed sections 

306.58 321.33 B: you actually get like a view of the bay and it's like you know you see the bay bridge i mean it's one of the more i mean the way it's been designed all the seats the way they calculated everything like you know you're like literally almost hovering over 

311.19 312.51 A: (( oh that must be cool )) 

321.45 325.91 B: home plate i mean every seat is like that i mean there's it's just gorgeous so i 

325.01 330.13 A: well we're we're we're waiting for these two stadiums because supposedly from uh 

330.16 338.06 A: uh you're supposed to be able to get a view of the skyline of the city from this from most points in the park that'll be pretty cool and like 

334.20 335.84 B: yeah wow 

336.32 337.09 B: yeah 

337.42 342.71 B: it is i mean that's it's it takes baseball to a completely different you know level 

341.67 351.01 A: well you know what it is the the the stadium we have now is is one of those mu- old multi purpose and it's so huge that you really can't see much of anything 'cause it's so big 

350.68 352.05 B: yeah yeah 

351.19 357.54 A: these these parks both of 'em will uh be smaller and i guess they'll be more open you'll be able to see things 

357.30 366.63 B: yeah i think that's that's a you know that's a good thing i mean design it's not you know e- everything is about design and attr- you know attract- 

366.60 375.72 B: attractiveness and convenience and and all that i just like to hopefully have multi use for the for the ballpark because before it used to be you know it was 

375.48 383.00 B: way out in the boonies and you know unless you got a game nothing was going on but now it's very close to the downtown area and i think 

382.21 384.07 A: (( now where do the niners play now )) 

384.13 392.07 B: niners play still at uh park or what you call candlestick park yeah yeah that's kind of way out in the boonies 

388.17 395.03 A: candlestick that's what i thought yeah i guess it was always they always complained about that for baseball i guess for football it's not bad 

392.46 394.24 B: yeah yeah 

394.41 404.03 B: well they were they talked about a new stadium over at you know to for the forty niners you know still at the same location but they were gonna rebuild it but you know ever since the dotcom 

401.86 402.75 A: right 

404.59 413.54 B: bust uh you know the city's scrambling around for money as as with all cities throughout the country and it's like you know that's been shelved [laughter] 

409.54 410.81 A: yeah that's true 

412.82 417.07 A: well i think they they they planned and built these parks um 

417.15 425.19 A: i guess kinda just in time yeah and plus the um the owner of the eagles kicked in i think two hundred million dollars 

417.20 419.48 B: before the [laughter] economy went sour 

419.57 420.59 B: yeah 

424.88 426.84 B: oh well that's always nice 

425.55 431.51 A: so it wasn't it was like uh the state paid a third the city a third and the eagles a third 

431.17 435.24 B: wow well that's always a that's a that's a pretty good deal you know 

432.06 433.16 A: which kind of 

434.59 437.89 A: well he'll he'll reap the benefits for you know that's for the 

437.65 438.97 B: [laughter] of course 

438.04 445.93 A: it's an unbelievably valuable franchise 'cause it's the only game in town as far as football goes you know it's not like new york with you know two teams and all 

442.59 444.04 B: right right 

444.99 447.90 B: two teams and all that right yeah 

446.20 448.50 A: yeah so he'll he'll uh 

448.73 454.05 A: he's al- i think he's already made a hundred and fifty million dollars on his initial investment so 

453.39 457.96 B: yeah yeah wow now do you watch a lot of sports on t._v. or 

454.87 455.91 A: (( and if they hit it )) 

457.59 463.67 A: yes i i'm not uh let's put it this way i'm mostly uh home team oriented 

463.14 466.02 B: okay well it sounds like me too you know [laughter] 

463.85 464.97 A: i mean i'll 

465.11 477.83 A: yeah i i i'll watch the super bowl but other than that i don't i used to when i was younger i'd watch you know both games every sunday but i kinda i just watch the eagles game now i don't i don't really tune into the other games 

477.47 478.84 B: yeah yeah 

477.92 480.11 A: once in a while i'll catch a monday night game

492.75 493.82 A: that's right 

494.28 498.65 A: it's too early for you and it's too late for us 'cause they don't get done until twelve thirty 

498.23 509.63 B: yeah that's always amazing to me like i mean if i were the players i mean oh it's like the time the time is like you know it's not a good time i'd be like asleep [laughter] towards the fourth quarter you know 

499.32 500.45 A: (( [laughter] yeah ))
