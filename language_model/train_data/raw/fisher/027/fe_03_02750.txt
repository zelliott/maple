57.86 65.00 A: yeah but we had a very very good season though i mean it was really uh exceptionally good 

60.94 62.06 B: yeah 

64.40 67.50 B: well we we can avoid that topic 

66.80 68.81 A: [laughter] 

68.02 74.67 B: [laughter] and why don't we uh you know what though i always i i love watching sports on t._v. i watch uh 

74.77 80.29 B: everything 'cause uh you know we you know in philly we got all all four majors 

80.20 83.54 A: oh yeah well i'm from new jersey so i understand yes 

82.92 90.62 B: [laughter] but um i'll tell ya i i do get uh uh feel like i get ripped off sometimes with the t._v. timeouts 

90.90 94.67 B: i think that and the bigger the game they're a little bit excessive 

93.93 105.09 A: [sigh] well the timeouts and and the replays i think that they have so much talking and replays that you really lose a little bit of what you know you're enjoying in the game on t._v. 

104.73 112.11 B: see i don't mind the replays as much just because they're a part of the you know especially in football it's part of the strategy you only have one 

108.64 109.63 A: mhm 

111.42 112.76 A: yeah that's true 

112.13 115.69 B: flag to throw but it's like take a 

116.14 117.59 B: a um 

118.39 126.40 B: a uh an n._b._a. game take like the last quarter of a n._b._a. game you know the last four minutes they could shove in 

120.76 122.28 A: mhm 

123.76 125.11 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

126.60 137.52 B: fifty commercials now some of them are and and some of them are just twenty second timeouts that the team wants uh is extended to you know a two minute timeout 

127.75 129.94 A: yeah that's true yeah 

132.18 133.18 A: mhm 

135.26 137.01 A: yeah it's true 

137.08 146.00 A: yeah it's true it it does get a little much after a while i i think it's uh it becomes so commercialistic that you really don't 

138.35 139.21 B: (( so )) 

146.31 154.08 A: you know you you can't get that enthusiasm level as high as you want now when you're there in person i love it you know i go hoarse 

154.12 159.83 A: but when you're on when it's on t._v. and i think that it's way over done and it is 

158.80 159.62 B: yeah 

159.90 162.07 B: actually can you hold on two seconds 

160.57 162.40 A: mhm yeah sure 

162.96 164.09 B: (( uh )) 

164.29 168.50 B: um like some of the football um 

169.02 170.40 B: some of the football 

171.04 174.05 B: you know it's nuts how they can push a fourth quarter 

174.29 175.20 B: (( you know )) 

174.30 176.05 A: yeah no mhm 

175.89 177.93 B: especially the bigger the game and then 

178.00 182.42 B: not only do they push the fourth quarter then you got all that uh scrolling 

182.81 184.53 B: advertising 

183.99 185.76 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

184.79 188.13 B: you know especially fox is you know huge on uh 

186.97 188.52 A: yes that's true 

188.23 190.55 B: after the game this and 

189.96 191.19 A: mhm 

190.57 193.67 B: things after that yeah [noise] 

192.72 193.89 A: it is true 

194.17 195.85 A: i don't know how 

195.90 198.98 A: i i think as long as the consumer 

199.04 207.20 A: goes along with it and doesn't complain about it and they don't lose sales on the on the uh you know the things that they're trying to push 

207.51 214.60 A: it's always gonna be like that i think that when the consumer takes a stand and starts writing to the companies 

214.61 222.56 A: and saying you know well why can't they do this throughout you know why can't some movies even on t._v. they will go and put all the commercials on the beginning 

222.66 224.44 A: you know or in the middle 

223.94 225.41 B: (( [mn] yeah yeah )) 

225.23 235.64 A: [noise] and i think until you know people start to take a stand [sigh] and make the big [sigh] you know to do over it it's it's been that way for so long 

235.32 242.03 B: well i've never watched um anything on direct t._v. or one of those things just 'cause 

241.00 242.61 A: i have direct t._v. 

242.22 245.53 B: well you know i'm a homer so i get all my teams 

244.06 244.90 A: oh 

245.49 258.04 B: on on on the regular channel so it's not like i have to like buy a you know a football ticket or something but i wonder if they show less advertising 'cause if it was more less advertising and more of a game feel 

251.79 252.74 A: right 

257.64 259.00 A: mhm 

258.34 261.07 B: because i mean you're paying for it upfront anyway mhm 

260.54 264.16 A: no well it isn't it's exactly the same i have direct t._v. 

263.62 264.92 B: mhm 

264.30 270.67 A: and uh i've had um you know regular cable stations and it seems to be almost the same 

270.75 271.73 B: (( ah huh )) 

270.82 277.99 A: almost the same there's not that much of a difference and i think they know they have you hooked boy you get to the last four minutes they know 

278.11 279.98 A: that that's where they want you 

279.76 284.95 B: see i would take uh i would buy an eagles game on pay per view 

285.21 295.56 B: for instance even if i could watch it on regular fox if i knew that it was gonna be less advertising and more of just straight action 

285.40 286.32 A: mhm 

295.77 308.45 A: yeah that's yes i i would do that too except i think the reason they don't do that for something like a bucks game is because they know that if they give it to you they're making a lot more money 

297.01 298.85 B: you know i would say mhm 

302.77 303.73 B: uh-huh 

308.93 312.88 A: you know giving you that because they don't really even for the regular um 

312.98 323.73 A: uh sports channels and you know if you just want a show they're not making really that much per se per household but this way they don't forget they get the whole country 

314.35 315.20 B: mhm 

323.68 325.66 B: yeah that's that's uh 

325.04 330.84 A: and that makes a big difference when you're getting the whole country and you're getting advertised at every single household 

330.91 337.11 A: that's watching that game and when it's the biggest game [laughter] or class game whoa [laughter] 

336.29 337.84 B: mhm that's uh 

337.52 340.24 A: say so you you really are 

340.40 344.91 A: uh you know getting your they're getting their money's worth you're not 

344.58 345.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

345.25 347.42 A: but they are [laughter] 

346.26 347.74 B: yeah that's true 

348.00 350.92 B: that is uh that's true 

350.59 351.60 A: mhm 

351.90 361.17 B: well oh i mean it's a shame too 'cause it's like uh you know and also the other thing is like the stuff when they put the stuff on late so the kids can't watch it you 

355.14 356.15 A: (( it is )) 

356.17 357.39 A: it really is 

360.72 361.86 A: mhm 

361.59 363.93 B: know that's also a shame 

362.47 363.56 A: oh yeah 

363.88 364.60 A: it's 

363.98 367.52 B: you know like the n._b._a. playoffs the sixers had a uh 

365.80 366.64 A: mhm 

367.57 369.04 B: a home game 

369.23 370.50 B: that started at 

371.19 373.58 B: so you know home in philly 

373.28 374.23 A: mhm 

373.62 380.34 B: you know i can understand if they were playing someone in a different time zone but they just did that just so they could be part of the uh 

376.83 377.80 A: mhm 

380.61 381.66 B: you know 

383.12 389.44 B: triple header event yeah you know and that's a shame for all the yeah but that's a shame for all the you know the kid fans 

383.51 386.64 A: the adult yeah well they're trying to get the adult 

386.99 387.92 A: yeah 

388.20 389.62 A: oh sure 

389.57 403.87 A: sure it is i don't think it gives kids i don't i don't think it unless you're keeping them up i don't think it gives kids uh a real feel for sports i i don't think they get a real feel for sports watching over t._v. anyhow 

389.70 391.89 B: and that's the long term dollar 

399.49 400.41 B: uh-huh 

403.35 410.73 B: when when when you know when when i was a kid and you could they used to have the playoff the baseball playoff games i think the uh 

409.71 410.65 A: mhm 

410.90 414.57 B: the uh divisional series always used to be on in the afternoon 

414.37 415.24 A: (( mm )) 

414.79 420.92 B: loved that you know you'd get you rush home from school and you could watch you know the whole 

415.82 416.70 A: oh 

418.26 420.16 A: right mhm 

420.96 429.52 B: you know i mean this is back in the you know the eighties and the you know seventies but you could watch the whole game now they would never ever do that 'cause uh they'd lose all the ratings 

427.24 428.06 A: no 

428.80 441.91 A: that's right well we um back in uh in the eighties i used to my kids i had kids and they were small and i used to go you know the kids never wanted to go much but one of them did and we'd go down to uh 

442.17 448.33 A: stadium in st pete and watch the uh red sox you know they had their their training 

446.96 447.76 B: uh-huh 

448.07 449.29 B: mhm 

448.64 458.07 A: so we could watch baseball oh my good- and i'll tell you i i never enjoyed it as much as when i started going down there and the kids really got to enjoy the baseball 

457.97 459.79 B: (( now you couldn't do that though )) 

458.69 459.55 A: (( you know )) 

459.96 461.92 B: you know now it would be 

461.13 462.29 A: yeah mm 

462.07 464.28 B: you know especially if you lived in boston 

464.06 465.11 A: mhm 

464.51 465.71 B: (( the uh )) 

466.31 467.28 B: you know 

467.56 475.49 B: uh eight o'clock start and it would be uh you know expensive to take the kid there 

475.44 478.68 A: oh yeah well here it was fifty cents 

475.72 477.65 B: yeah it cost you a fortunate 

478.42 479.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

478.99 485.54 A: fifty cents a game in fact even now with a coupon you can get in for a dollar a game when they have it 

485.02 487.10 B: (( yeah that's that's great )) 

486.50 488.01 A: isn't that great 

487.37 491.05 B: that's great but at spring training then watch what they do to the regular season 

490.37 496.10 A: the oh [laughter] well we can't go into the regular season 'cause then it goes up so high i can't afford it 

495.62 497.28 B: yep exactly 

496.70 498.12 A: [laughter] 

497.32 499.50 B: exactly 

498.90 499.76 A: yeah 

499.73 504.14 B: but [mn] eventually someone will figure out how to fix it you 

503.64 506.71 A: yeah probably but i i think it 

505.04 509.16 B: know 'cause what they're doing i think they're discounting you know 

509.29 512.99 B: young future fans for current dollars 

510.97 511.98 A: mhm 

512.47 514.33 A: well i think that 

513.25 515.43 B: you can do that for so long 

514.72 515.77 A: yeah 

515.49 520.60 B: before you put yourself in a financial situation 

520.00 527.73 A: yeah that's true well we're in a generation well at least i am where we uh we grew up with the television 

527.50 528.60 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

527.97 538.52 A: so and we take a lot from the t._v. stat- really do from the uh all the shows with all the commercials like last night i watched lucy 

538.21 539.17 B: (( mhm )) 

538.54 540.63 A: there were so many commercials 

539.94 541.90 B: (( [noise] oh yes yeah )) 

541.07 543.05 A: that it was like ridiculous 

542.47 548.69 B: yeah well that's that's another example the ratings it's sunday night they know they have everyone home 

543.96 545.54 A: that's it see 

545.68 547.19 A: exactly 

547.51 549.74 A: they've got everybody 

548.98 550.53 B: and watching it [mn] 

550.57 553.96 A: but see we're so programmed to to let them get away with that 

553.81 555.15 B: (( yeah )) 

554.54 567.87 A: we are i mean we you know i it it even if i had to pay uh you know let's say you know a little box on the t._v. [laughter] put two dollars and have it com- you know have it commercial free but they don't want that 

567.87 572.37 A: they make all their money for the whole show from the from the money they make on the commercials 

571.74 574.88 B: that's why they're that's why they're fighting that whole tivo thing 

574.19 576.06 A: mhm oh yeah 

575.38 583.29 B: tivo's great you know you can sit and watch without commercials but th- that's why the network's are going berserk on it [noise] 

579.21 580.10 A: yes 

582.97 587.34 A: mhm they remember they had a while ago um where 

587.37 596.91 A: uh they they had you could pick out of the programs of all the things that were on t._v. and there was like three hundred and some stations what you really like to see 

597.81 598.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

598.45 599.89 A: and uh
