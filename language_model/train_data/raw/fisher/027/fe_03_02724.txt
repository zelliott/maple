0.30 1.45 B: hello 

0.48 1.60 A: hello 

1.50 2.55 B: hi 

2.60 4.40 A: hi i'm david go ahead 

3.74 5.61 B: hi this is sandy 

5.45 7.97 A: sandy hi i haven't done this before so 

7.59 17.86 B: oh this is my second time [laughter] but no basically we just have to talk about i don't know exactly what they're doing the study on but we just have to talk about the topic [laughter] 

14.13 14.99 A: okay 

17.31 18.20 A: (( okay okay )) 

18.09 20.97 B: (( 'cause they quickly so what do you think about bioterrorism )) 

21.19 22.43 A: um 

22.21 23.98 B: do you think anything about it [noise] 

24.17 26.54 A: no i i do but i think 

26.64 28.30 A: i think a lot of 

29.95 30.75 A: i mean 

30.75 32.12 A: w- with all the 

32.12 34.63 A: the war and stuff that's been taking place with the u._s. 

34.63 35.82 A: i think the u._s. 

35.82 50.24 A: is kind of going after easy targets instead of necessarily accurate targets because i think bioterrorism won't necessarily be i think it's kind of unavoidable that it will happen at some point in time but i think the people who we have 

41.54 42.42 B: mhm 

47.72 48.56 B: yeah 

50.23 54.78 A: to be worried about are not necessarily governments but are 

53.19 54.08 B: [noise] 

55.09 58.89 A: you know people feel they're not accountable to anything or anyone 

56.62 57.46 B: [noise] 

57.92 58.84 B: mhm 

59.14 60.10 A: (( so )) 

59.22 65.19 B: yeah [noise] like the people in other countries that that don't care and they would kill themselves you know 

65.46 78.87 A: yeah well i mean to to be honest i don't even know if it's just people in other countries because like if you look at the oklahoma city attack that was done by americans um if you look at um if if 

75.13 76.03 B: (( right [noise] )) 

79.36 93.54 A: if you look at a place like like palestine with israel the people who are doing suicide pacts are are people who live there so i i mean ev- ev- even though it's it's easy to say yeah okay i think the thread is coming from someone else 

83.80 84.73 B: mhm 

87.36 88.16 B: (( yeah i )) 

93.61 101.35 A: uh it could easily be someone here who's aggravated or crazy or whatever look at like school shootings or postal 

100.40 101.32 B: (( know )) 

101.43 105.26 A: you know when people postal employees kill other people it's it's 

105.41 108.62 A: americans as well so i don't know what do you think 

107.09 108.23 B: (( that's true )) 

108.39 112.86 B: um i don't know if there's anything really that we can do to prevent it it's just so 

113.04 114.72 B: i mean it's so 

114.99 121.12 B: like although nothing really really bad has happened i mean as far as like you know when setting 

121.13 124.07 B: (( stuff like you know you always hear about how people like to )) 

124.66 132.23 B: take like a small vial or something and spread in like the new york subways and it would just go and kill like 

129.06 130.06 A: right 

132.18 141.04 B: hundreds of thousands of people within you know ten minutes they talk about like how they can take a crop duster and you know it it seems like it's all very 

135.28 136.56 A: right 

141.08 147.25 B: easy you know but you never hear about anything like that and i definitely think that like the next attack if 

142.32 143.28 A: yeah 

147.18 157.41 B: anything i mean they talk about it so much i think that yeah it's not gonna be you know it's not gonna be another plane crashing into a building it's probably gonna be something like that they're gonna 

157.74 167.48 B: somehow find some way to have some noxious gas or like you know deadly gas and and spread it somehow and if you think about it there's really no way that we can control that you know 

167.31 168.77 A: right 

168.14 169.23 B: i mean 

169.04 175.90 A: yeah something more stealth something that's not gonna you know you you can't see a gas spreading or something [noise] 

172.64 173.95 B: right people 

175.35 178.82 B: no exactly and people you know people can 

178.84 190.47 B: certainly control well actually they can't but i mean like to a certain extent they can control certain ways of um terrorism but bioterrorism is something that is just so 

191.21 192.99 B: difficult to prevent 

193.03 202.57 B: um i don't know if there's anything that we can do e- e- especially when the method of it is so easy to conceal i mean you 

193.07 194.72 A: yeah 

202.63 211.32 B: know like i was reading this article on you can take this little tiny vial you know i mean you could just conceal it in in your palms drop it in the subway system 

211.11 212.91 A: mhm 

211.66 216.81 B: a subway would come barreling down and crush it release it everybody would probably die you know 

216.37 217.94 A: yeah 

217.19 218.71 B: and um 

218.76 221.41 A: ac- actually do you live in a big city 

220.82 222.62 B: i live in new york yeah 

221.82 224.64 A: okay same here yeah i 

223.29 228.53 B: [laughter] so it's just kinda like something that it's like wow wow you know 

228.57 233.59 B: but you never hear about anything like that but i definitely do think that the next big attack will be like that 

230.84 231.92 A: well 

233.58 238.54 A: i i think i think one thing that people probably often overlook is 

238.47 245.14 A: creating a uh a chemical agent or some type of bioterrorist weapon isn't easy 

244.75 245.78 B: mhm 

245.09 254.70 A: and it requires a lot of you know research dollars but a lot of the stuff that's been created like that has been created by 

249.47 250.63 B: (( that's true )) 

255.39 263.65 A: [laughter] governments like our own i mean like that anthrax that was spread in the letters you know a year ago or so 

257.12 258.39 B: yeah [laughter] 

260.68 261.66 B: right 

263.54 267.82 A: they traced that back to a u._s. government lab they don't know who did it 

267.45 269.04 B: oh really 

267.59 273.78 A: but but the the strain that was actually spread came from a u._s. government lab at one point in time we don't 

272.83 274.15 B: oh 

273.56 283.70 A: we don't we don't still i mean from from yeah from what i read we don't still create anthrax but if we did at one point in time you know 

275.43 277.67 B: i don't think i knew that [laughter] 

283.51 289.42 A: i just hope that that our own government takes care of what you know what we create you 

289.29 297.50 B: right and they're not like letting it escape from somewhere and no but it could be yeah it could end up being what kills us 

289.84 290.67 A: know 

293.51 294.85 A: yeah 

297.55 306.51 A: yeah i mean it could just yeah it's that's that's the the thing you know i don't i don't mean to sound like i don't trust anybody but 

297.91 299.56 B: (( and if us )) 

305.48 316.71 B: [noise] right but things happen you know i mean you always see it the movies how like one slip of you know whatever you know it doesn't doesn't take much for things like that to happen but um 

307.28 308.24 A: yeah 

311.43 313.15 A: yeah 

313.79 315.11 A: yeah 

317.13 322.02 B: most yeah i did not know that that it was actually traced back to one their labs that's interesting 

320.80 325.83 A: yeah well that's that's the article i read but you know you knows if you can believe the articles either 

325.20 327.25 B: (( [noise] mhm yeah [noise] )) 

325.92 327.05 A: (( [laughter] so )) 

327.34 335.42 B: oh but um yeah i mean [noise] like simple as that you know i mean obviously it does exist and it's spreading very soon 

336.09 347.09 B: you know [noise] they could just take that and just spread it and boom [noise] you know even if it doesn't take right away it could [noise] that's the thing [noise] so but um 

343.45 344.30 A: right 

347.14 352.99 B: (( no it's really scary and it just kinda makes me want to move to canada or switzerland to be neutral )) 

351.04 352.69 A: (( yeah )) 

353.06 355.67 B: just to avoid all this you know 'cause we 

354.74 355.61 A: yeah 

355.87 358.90 B: like i think about new york and this is definitely 

359.09 363.12 B: you know prime target area but i think if 

363.74 366.62 B: (( they're not going to do it here again )) 

366.46 371.12 A: yeah but you know life life is so unpredictable that you know even 

370.13 379.33 B: right like the that third plane that went down it was like right outside pittsburgh i mean i'm sure those people didn't [noise] expect you know in their little quiet town anything [noise] bad to happen 

373.07 374.00 A: yeah 

379.07 380.71 A: yeah exactly 

380.24 386.83 B: there and i'm sure oklahoma city you know they didn't expect anything in this town it's not like a big city 

381.18 383.18 A: exactly 

384.74 386.42 A: yeah i i 

386.51 388.86 A: are you from new york originally 

388.29 392.80 B: no i'm actually from [noise] pennsylvania i moved to new york um like five years ago 

392.65 404.11 A: okay okay yeah i'm from illinois originally and it's like i you know okay maybe there could be an attack in chicago but you know like some small farm town of course you wouldn't expect it but you 

393.31 394.75 B: yeah [noise] 

395.72 396.52 B: oh 

403.43 409.11 B: right [noise] [noise] you never know i mean you always have to think about like well [noise] it's smarter not to do 

404.47 405.85 A: know you never know 

410.27 414.90 B: (( the big cities [noise] can you hang on just a second [noise] )) 

413.17 414.15 A: yeah sure 

416.23 424.14 B: um do you ever think about that they won't be like the two big you know they won't choose the big cities again you know they might do like the smaller 

422.66 423.76 A: yeah 

424.15 425.94 B: smaller towns because 

426.24 428.56 B: or something you know people won't expect it there 

428.49 429.69 A: right 

429.49 437.07 B: it scares them into thinking it could be anyway you know but obviously i guess they wanna go for mass 

437.93 439.93 B: mass amounts of people 

439.79 452.18 A: right and and i think another thing is that i feel like we often jump to conclusions about who it would be you know like who the terrorists are but there's tons of terrorists and they're not all you know 

446.66 447.55 B: mhm 

452.05 460.79 A: muslim fundamentalists they're they are tons of terrorists in the world um i mean there's terrorism's been going on in northern ireland for 

453.57 454.48 B: right 

460.97 469.51 A: centuries with protestant versus catholics and stuff like that i mean any it could be anyone who's just pissed off you know you 

461.96 463.02 B: mhm 

468.87 469.81 B: (( yeah )) 

469.59 477.09 A: you fire someone from a uh a chemical weapons plant or something and they take something with them so you know it 

477.25 479.56 A: it could be anything so 

478.61 483.52 B: (( that's true that's true it's really scary when you think about it you know i mean )) 

482.25 483.09 A: yeah 

484.06 491.91 B: i don't know that's after the attacks you know on the world trade cente- center that's when i started thinking about you know 'cause i was talking to one of my friends and 

491.97 493.94 B: talking about bioterrorism 

493.56 495.67 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

494.67 507.91 B: [sigh] and like wow it could be anywhere and when the whole anthrax thing was there saying they had you know from within it wasn't from another country i'm like why would somebody do that against their own country at in a time like this 

500.89 502.86 A: (( yeah he's there )) 

503.46 504.27 A: [noise] 

507.74 512.52 A: (( right right i don't know i think it's [noise] )) 

508.48 509.40 B: (( you know )) 

510.37 511.84 B: i guess 

512.32 515.34 B: that's the hard thing you know 

513.01 513.79 A: sorry 

516.13 519.66 B: i guess that's when they're gonna strike you know if they don't wanna 

520.12 522.52 B: if they wanna blame it on somebody else you know 

522.12 523.62 A: right 

522.79 525.42 B: that's probably the time that they would do it at so 

524.93 526.09 A: right 

525.96 527.57 B: (( i don't know it's crazy [noise] )) 

526.68 529.17 A: i mean i i think um 

530.04 540.30 A: you know i was reading something um recently that there was saying if if you if you read the um the geneva convention which is about 

540.27 543.21 A: you know war crimes and stuff like that 

543.14 549.64 A: um there's a clause in it that says using chemical weapons of any kind including like tear gas 

549.53 554.15 A: is considered is considered a violation so ev- even though 

549.54 550.36 B: mhm 

551.97 553.06 B: oh yeah 

554.03 564.85 A: you know america can use tear gas against citizen when they protest or you know israel can use tear gas against palestinians when they protest technically if it's between 

564.72 573.97 A: like people from one country and soldiers of another country even something like tear gas is a a war crime 

573.43 574.44 B: really 

573.98 575.92 A: well yeah so 

575.64 578.44 B: and they can be punished for that offence 

577.58 580.94 A: [laughter] yeah i guess if they can trace it to you so 

581.06 585.53 B: that's so interesting so it's it's nothing if it's like one 

585.82 591.17 B: the people against the people you know in in the same country but if it's against a different country then 

591.23 599.90 A: yeah it it has something to do with the fact that tear gas is defined as a chemical weapon so 

591.37 592.68 B: then that's
