27.98 29.40 A: yeah 

28.73 34.46 B: [lipsmack] plus the mutual feelings that you know the feeling of loving and giving and 

34.49 36.73 B: it's just so much different

64.49 77.31 A: and like we're big on desserts so usually the same amount of people that there are there will be that many different desserts that can make it [laughter] so it it's insane it like thanksgiving at my house is like everyone goes home with a

92.17 94.17 A: yeah but um 

94.50 98.69 A: we we actually my f- we're not very religious so we kinda 

98.84 101.59 A: we celebrate hanukkah with the with 

101.59 112.56 A: like the ceremonial stuff as far as like lighting the menorah and things and and we'll get together on the first night of hanukkah and my mom will make latkes but then we also kinda exchange gifts on christmas because um 

112.42 122.44 A: it just started out that way because when i was in school and my sister was in school we were never together on hanukkah we um we you know 'cause we were both away and so when we came back 

122.49 135.92 A: would be christmas so we [laughter] would exchange gifts on christmas [sigh] um so yeah we'd we did the whole gift thing on christmas but when we do we usually do the gift thing and then we do d- uh charity work like we uh [lipsmack] 

136.33 143.50 A: we'd uh deliver food for the there's this uh organization here gods love we deliver which uh delivers meals to 

143.68 146.65 A: uh homebound people with aids 

146.41 147.70 B: [noise] uh-huh [noise] 

146.84 150.24 A: and so we'd do that on every christmas 

150.30 159.99 A: um so that's our christmas i mean 'cause you know we're not christians so we don't have like a big family thing it's just like my parents and me and my sister 

160.01 164.93 B: ah that's wonderful well we in my case it's it's pretty well 

160.96 162.74 A: (( yeah it is nice )) 

164.95 173.79 B: uh christmas y'all y'all celebrate one and we celebrate another and that's great now it's just different to them religious relations no problem 

173.39 175.13 A: yeah yeah 

174.12 178.38 B: as long as you believe that there is a higher power that is what is important 

177.84 183.01 A: well i don't know if i really believe that either [laughter] i i i believe in in 

182.20 184.49 B: i'm really bombing out here aren't i 

184.08 195.64 A: no well i i believe in i belie- i mean i believe in that i- if everyone would respect themselves and respect everyone else it would be the world would be a great place regardless of religion 

195.42 197.02 B: yes that's the truth 

195.62 200.81 A: you know you know it's that that's that's my personal belief um 

201.60 212.54 A: but i mean i i'm i mean we're discussing the holidays so we don't need to go [laughter] into this but but i don't really believe in the higher power but i i believe in in treating yourself and other people well 

212.82 213.62 A: um 

212.97 215.13 B: well to be honest with you 

217.16 219.08 B: (( [cough] pardon me )) 

219.24 222.01 B: to be honest with you the uh th- 

222.03 233.76 B: uh where i call myself christian i'm i'm probably more like you i i'm not really a an a stout uh christian uh i believe in the ten commandments and the golden rule 

232.37 233.36 A: mhm 

233.56 235.34 A: yeah the golden rule 

233.92 240.25 B: and believe that the whole world would be a whole lot better place if we just practise those ethics 

239.91 250.96 A: exactly regardless of your belief if you if you just if you just like have respect for other people if you know if everyone would just be a little mayflower [laughter] you know and 

245.69 246.69 B: right 

250.34 251.72 B: mhm 

250.95 258.72 A: it it would just be a better place it doesn't really matter who i believe in or who you believe in if we just would respect each other's belief you know it's 

258.09 265.80 B: well i do i've been in uh public uh public services for customer services uh most all of my career 

265.78 273.77 B: and believe me you don't even talk about anything in that respect for the simple fact you might offend somebody and the truth is 

273.87 275.46 B: you just be nice 

275.17 276.74 A: yeah exactly 

275.61 277.62 B: that's all it is just be nice 

277.83 280.25 A: exactly i i totally agree with you 

280.40 289.66 B: anyway back to the subject matter it's still well you thanksgiving and christmas used to be the biggest ones now uh july the fourth 

290.03 298.80 B: uh was i guess the next uh because we'd usually get together when my mother and daddy was alive we'd get together for a barbecue or a pick out or something 

297.69 298.95 A: (( and uh-huh )) 

299.08 313.40 B: now that my mom and dad's passed on uh the m- uh we rarely ever get together to be honest with you if you get just if two or three of the five of us children get together uh in any of the holidays we're doing very well 

313.41 314.56 A: oh really 

313.55 320.01 B: and uh yeah and and it's really sad 'cause we you know family reunions are a thing of the past just about 

319.60 329.81 A: yeah it's kinda if in my family too like the the person that used to organize the family reunions which weren't a- for any particular ho- holiday but we used to have one like 

329.62 340.78 A: once a year or so and he passed away and we really don't have them anymore and my generation i i'm like i'm thirty three and my generation 

340.66 354.89 A: like we don't even really know each other like my my parent's generation like they all lived in the same neighborhood you know they all would like get together you know they they would see each other all the time whereas like my cousin a- i know like my first cousins 

354.94 369.50 A: um but as far as my other cousin who may be my age but would be like my second cousins twice removed or whatever but it's still around my age i don't even know them like i would know their name but if i saw them on a street i wouldn't know them it's kind of sad 

358.10 358.88 B: mm 

369.72 372.04 A: [lipsmack] but a- as i think uh 

369.94 370.97 B: yeah 

372.37 383.38 A: i i guess it's because you know people aren't all living in the same place anymore like back in the back in the day when in my parents' day like they they all lived in brooklyn [laughter] you know 

383.67 391.92 B: yes well i've my fam- i'm alabama born in alabama raised in alabama and i've raised my children in alabama 

389.30 390.69 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

391.26 395.64 A: oh really are you in uh rural ab- alabama or are you in a city 

395.00 396.81 B: in birmingham alabama 

396.23 398.40 A: oh okay so you're in the city right 

397.76 401.87 B: yeah [lipsmack] oh i i wish [mn] i wish i were 

401.90 410.62 B: a matter of fact i'm sitting here on the computer right now uh going through emails and and just wishing for [mn] my husband and i have um 

410.85 411.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

411.47 416.72 B: anniversaries used to be a big thing but he wasn't here on our ninth anniversary 

416.83 420.47 B: and more recently i found that you know he's been 

420.49 424.57 B: sleeping around i doubt if there's gonna be a tenth 

421.56 422.46 A: oh 

424.70 429.05 B: so and for christmas he had another woman at his mother's so 

428.27 429.79 A: are you serious 

429.10 430.88 B: i'm very serious 

430.87 434.26 A: drop that jerk [laughter] god 

433.18 437.79 B: drop the jerk i just found his uh profile in match dotcom 

437.42 439.06 A: oh my god 

439.04 441.30 B: and it was just updated yesterday 

441.29 442.97 A: oh my god 

442.98 445.67 A: are are you are you still living with him 

443.13 444.05 B: so 

445.51 450.97 B: [lipsmack] uh he'd he'd been living with her for over six months and he and he came back wearing 

449.76 451.64 A: so you're separated 

451.10 456.17 B: we were separated and i let him come back in after he said you know after he pro- 

456.11 467.03 B: i though proved that he really meant what he said this time and then to find him cheating [noise] so i'm i'm thoroughly upset and right now quite frankly christmas is kinda like a bummer for me anyway 

466.64 479.49 A: yeah see that's the bad thing about christmas is like i think in general it's a really happy holiday but for so many people it's sad like for anyone that you know has lost someone close to them or 

479.35 493.28 A: that that that isn't with their family or whatever it i think it's actually a really sad holiday for a lot of people you know and and sometimes i i find christmas depressing um in in that way in that 

494.14 496.20 A: you know like you you the 

496.29 497.95 A: i dunno it just seems a 

497.78 511.50 A: lot like like i- it's i- it will be either extreme you know like if you're if you are where you wanna be then yeah it's great and i think it could be the best and you know it's great to be with family but there is there's some people that don't have family or they just 

511.31 516.52 A: had a loss whether it be divorce or death or whatever and it's just like 

517.24 520.60 A: it's almost like a big disappointment you know 

519.83 530.52 B: yeah it is and tha- and that's usually [noise] a according to to statistics usually the worst time for someone to do something stupid 

530.64 531.96 A: yeah 

531.31 535.83 B: and and that's probably the reason why because it's a depressing time if you 

536.02 544.62 B: if you've suffered a very big loss um uh valentine's day that should be another one wonderful wonderful one that time 

544.17 550.72 A: now i'm single so i'm [laughter] it's almost never good for me it's like ugh 

550.54 551.53 B: (( oh yeah )) 

551.43 553.43 A: uh-huh i get better [laughter] 

551.94 555.34 B: hey that if that's what it's gotta be that's what it's gotta be 

555.43 557.40 B: (( um you know i di- )) 

555.52 556.47 A: yeah 

557.93 561.91 B: i was married to this one fella you know for nine years and thought he would kep- 

562.10 568.69 B: he would catch me out was what i was going to say thought he was absolutely wonderful but quite frankly i d- i i don't believe my 

568.83 580.86 B: uh next big occasion be that july the fourth labor day uh thanksgiving christmas whatever and anniversary comes just after labor day i don't believe it will ever b- be 

581.64 584.60 B: uh ever be the same i mean it's 

583.29 593.20 A: yeah i think it put definitely definitely puts a damper on things i mean it you know uh i'm not saying right away but one day it might be better because maybe you'll 

593.05 599.89 A: you'll be in a in a better place in a better relationship that with someone that really is trustworthy and whatever
