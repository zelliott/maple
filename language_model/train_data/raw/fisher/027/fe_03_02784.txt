0.28 1.49 B: hello 

0.87 2.07 A: (( hi )) 

1.75 3.28 B: hi my name's donna 

3.04 4.38 A: hi i'm jennifer 

3.96 5.24 B: (( hello jennifer )) 

5.45 6.96 B: so you like sports 

6.85 8.09 A: (( ah i )) 

8.30 10.10 A: i watch football 

9.90 10.84 B: (( do you )) 

10.45 18.61 A: yeah and ah you know at o- at olympics time i tend to watch gymnastics or figure skating but that's about it how about you 

16.02 16.97 B: (( really )) 

17.00 18.23 B: yeah 

18.30 24.42 B: oh i kinda like soccer mostly 'cause my kids are in it but i do like to watch the u. s. team 

21.00 22.18 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

24.73 26.94 B: during that time like the olympics 

26.33 27.22 A: yeah 

27.33 33.58 B: and ah i i'm not too much on football i i guess they're what's the name of that big game they play once a year 

33.15 34.24 A: the superbowl 

33.82 37.38 B: yeah i watched that once [laughter] 

34.28 37.02 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

37.15 39.92 A: well you got to 'cause they have all the good commercials [laughter] 

39.51 41.11 B: [laughter] yeah that's true too 

41.91 45.60 B: but anyways um [lipsmack] what was the other question they ask 

44.99 50.21 A: uh like how many hours a week do you yeah it's funny because my 

46.60 47.75 B: oh okay 

50.28 58.10 A: i no one in my family watches sports at all and i you know my parents always used to joke when i was little that our t. v. didn't get sports 

57.52 58.87 B: (( [laughter] mhm mm )) 

57.95 71.82 A: but i but my husband loves football and so when we were dating you know he i would watch it with him and he would teach me all the- i didn't even know what the plays were and any of the terminology or anything and he taught it all to me and i actually got 

71.73 73.32 A: really into it so 

73.55 76.56 A: who knew so i'm still the only one in my family who 

74.48 75.24 B: yeah 

76.23 77.43 B: [laughter] 

76.80 78.71 A: watches anything like that but 

78.57 84.78 B: i guess in growing up ah even though we played a lot of sports as kids we never watched it on t. v. 

84.17 85.09 A: yeah 

84.98 89.37 B: but that was many moon moons ago you know black and white type thing 

87.03 88.31 A: [laughter] 

89.02 90.20 A: right 

89.89 92.92 B: but ah no but like i said since my kids [lipsmack] 

93.22 98.06 B: they're into basketball and so you kinda you know they're watching it on t. v. now 

98.74 101.54 B: so i put in about an hour a week [laughter] 

100.61 102.29 A: yeah yeah 

101.70 105.48 B: [laughter] that's my [mn] news is a different story 

105.25 106.99 A: (( oh yeah you a big news watcher )) 

107.05 113.34 B: yeah yeah i and another thing that kind of repels me from the sports is what they pay these athletes 

112.91 113.84 A: right 

113.71 116.23 B: i have a hard time with that 

116.04 118.75 A: you know i always used to think that too and then 

118.93 125.95 A: ah as i learned more about football i learned that actually it it makes more sense than i realized because they 

126.36 140.72 A: many of the athletes because of injury or just because of the high caliber they have to perform at can really only play for maybe five years and so in many ways it's supposed to be their salary for their whole lives 

132.05 132.96 B: mhm 

135.77 136.60 B: (( mm )) 

140.44 141.25 B: mm 

140.85 146.38 A: you know and i'd never thought about it that way but that makes it seem a little bit more justifiable to me 

146.48 151.78 A: since many of them don't have training in any other field you know so it's like they finish football and then 

149.93 150.92 B: oh 

151.65 152.73 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

151.91 153.30 A: what are they supposed to do 

153.09 155.12 B: yeah but twenty million you know 

154.58 158.24 A: yeah it's a lot [laughter] it's a lot yeah 

155.74 157.51 B: [laughter] 

157.67 159.56 B: i wouldn't make that in a lifetime 

159.46 162.57 A: no i i would like to but i don't 

163.12 165.42 B: no i can't even hit a lottery ticket 

165.15 168.62 A: expect to [laughter] i don't even try lottery tickets 

165.49 167.38 B: [laughter] 

168.18 169.06 B: no 

169.13 172.17 B: [mn] so and what was the third question do you remember mm 

172.18 173.15 A: um 

173.46 175.32 A: i don't remember a third question actually 

176.86 179.17 B: it's kind of hard the way that they do it now 

179.41 183.86 B: you know when they first present themselves 'cause you're kind of rushed to 

179.99 180.87 A: yeah 

181.83 182.75 A: yeah 

183.19 185.50 A: right right to answer all the questions 

185.03 186.50 B: yeah so [lipsmack] 

185.93 187.65 A: well how old are your kids 

187.30 190.73 B: uh i have a seventeen and a half and a 

191.10 192.55 B: twelve year old 

192.19 192.99 A: (( yeah mm )) 

192.88 200.91 B: a girl yeah but she's right into the basketball she's a good little player i call her my little bulldog and the soccer 

197.65 198.55 A: yeah 

199.07 200.12 A: [laughter] 

201.04 204.37 B: [lipsmack] the only problem is it keeps me going all the time 

203.93 205.26 A: oh i'm sure 

204.87 207.77 B: you know 'cause like every night it's a different sport 

207.39 211.13 A: especially when they get to high school they have to practice it so much mhm 

210.48 212.96 B: yeah well this year she got um 

213.12 216.20 B: there was somebody scouting and they want her on the travel team 

216.29 223.55 B: so she had to travel and i i agreed to it thinking oh you know local school districts right to me that was travel 

221.43 222.53 A: right 

223.12 224.16 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

223.57 224.40 B: (( [laughter] uh-uh )) 

224.53 228.31 B: [laughter] and being from maine you know maine's a large state [noise] 

227.71 228.65 A: right 

228.85 231.14 B: so we did a lot of traveling 

230.79 234.20 A: wow and so so it's your responsibility to get her everywhere 

233.61 235.85 B: oh yeah yeah 

234.23 239.52 A: wow i would think they have a just a team bus or something and take care of it 

237.95 242.74 B: well because it it's so far the distance between from school to school 

242.28 243.45 A: mhm 

242.83 247.30 B: you know like even though the travel team is all like say within a certain school system 

247.37 253.78 B: that's still like a half an hour thirty five minute ride so for them to go and pick up everybody or have them meet there you know 

249.70 250.71 A: yeah 

253.37 254.73 A: yeah that makes sense 

254.46 261.67 B: yeah so we're kind of busy this year with the sports thing and my son kind of dropped off once he got his license 

261.65 263.55 A: yeah [laughter] 

262.81 264.70 B: and a job [laughter] 

263.87 267.03 A: oh yeah yeah sure that makes a difference 

266.70 267.96 B: so do you have any children 

267.68 269.22 A: ah no no 

270.17 271.63 B: (( no not yet [laughter] )) 

270.98 274.86 A: not yet [laughter] i'm only twenty six so i just got married in august so we're 

274.85 275.71 B: oh 

275.11 277.16 A: not quite ready for that yet 

276.44 279.19 B: well no i got married when i got thirty 

278.76 279.61 A: yeah 

279.73 281.00 B: and then ah 

282.03 283.51 B: well i'm much older now 

283.66 294.72 B: [laughter] do the math you know [laughter] but um no and then i did some hunting when i first moved up here because originally i was from down the mass area i was a city girl 

283.90 284.74 A: [laughter] 

286.04 287.56 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

294.47 295.28 A: yeah 

295.15 297.17 B: so life's kind of like different up here 

297.15 298.69 A: i'm sure yeah yeah 

298.45 299.31 B: very 

300.03 307.02 B: [laughter] and ah they don't really have too much sport that's another thing about this rural area is the sports just aren't 

307.55 310.82 B: they don't do them like you know it's 

308.60 309.69 A: yeah 

311.34 313.71 B: they're not really into the sports scene 

313.44 315.29 A: that's interesting i wonder why 

315.74 317.51 B: ah well 

317.64 320.55 B: i guess it goes by um [mn] 

320.68 323.17 B: you know it's a logging community i guess 

322.72 323.57 A: yeah 

323.74 326.47 B: and you know they they go to work young 

326.63 327.52 A: yeah 

327.88 332.63 B: and ah they never really they're just starting to get into like a few years ago the soccer 

333.41 336.62 B: which to me sports is very good with for students 

336.01 338.25 A: mhm yeah absolutely 

338.07 345.60 B: because i know my son when he started soccer in i think second grade all his grades improved because he was on a a routine 

345.32 346.41 A: yeah 

345.81 349.41 B: you know he was responsible to get his homework done to be able to play 

349.17 350.03 A: yeah 

350.31 351.28 B: (( so mhm )) 

351.14 353.09 A: and they always say it also it just helps 

353.85 357.32 A: students learn time management and all those kinds of things yeah yeah 

357.10 362.77 B: yeah i wonder if those pro football players have any of that [laughter] 

360.64 369.30 A: [laughter] well i think they do when they're in college because you know just like they're saying they're responsible they can't play if they don't keep their grades up so they have 

369.31 375.85 A: designated study hours where they have to be with the whole team studying and they have tutors there and all these kind of things so 

375.54 376.68 B: yeah 

376.02 379.09 A: but ah i'm sure it's different once they 

379.23 380.91 A: finish and they're on their own [laughter] 

380.73 387.10 B: i think they're doing more um [lipsmack] oh what do they call those spots rings for [laughter] commercials in other words 

386.32 388.20 A: right right right 

387.69 391.93 B: do you ever follow oh what's his name the one that just retired the basketball player 

391.62 392.81 A: michael jordan 

392.38 393.62 B: yeah 

393.25 406.72 A: no you know i i don't watch basketball at all and so i don't i don't follow i mean you know of course i know his name 'cause everyone does but i i don't know anything really about him even though he's in my area i'm actually in the washington d. c. area and so he's 

396.75 397.42 B: mm 

406.24 407.69 B: (( mhm yeah mm )) 

406.89 410.12 A: with the washington wizards for a while on and off at least 

409.79 411.30 B: oh yeah mhm 

410.35 420.95 A: but ah but yeah that's about all i know [laughter] it seems like every few months they say he's retiring this is his last game and then he's had like about ten of those [laughter] 

418.00 419.69 B: (( yeah i kind of [laughter] )) 

420.35 423.50 B: i i heard those a few times [laughter] on the news 

421.64 422.94 A: yeah 

423.24 424.77 A: right yeah 

424.34 431.43 B: but no i um the only thing i know about football is what was it two years ago the new england patriots won it 

431.13 433.73 A: yeah i think it was two years ago yeah 

431.50 432.53 B: is that right 

433.10 439.18 B: yeah what's ah oh what was his name i guess he wore um [lipsmack] plays for the rams wagner 

438.95 440.16 A: kurt warner 

439.77 440.81 B: warner 

440.26 441.08 A: yeah 

441.29 444.33 B: yeah he won that thing right 

443.92 448.63 A: right right they won it ah i guess it was three years ago maybe 

448.99 453.02 B: (( yeah it's yeah mhm and then he kind of like fizzled out )) 

449.50 451.13 A: yeah yeah 

452.92 459.74 A: yeah he got injured he hurt his thumb or something i think and so sometimes you know when you get that kind of injury you can't 

455.76 456.64 B: oh 

460.60 466.64 A: come back at your full power power it just doesn't feel right and you can't do it as well as you could before 

464.60 465.34 B: oh 

466.62 467.46 B: (( mm )) 

467.15 468.02 A: but 

468.05 470.05 B: [lipsmack] i was wondering what happened to him 

470.72 479.52 A: yeah so so people in your area who watch football would they be patriots fans or or are you just a patriots fan from being from massachusetts 

478.68 479.24 B: (( [mn] )) 

479.49 480.53 B: um 

480.66 482.92 B: i think they are the bulk of them 

482.52 483.44 A: yeah 

483.13 486.72 B: but it's kinda hard because there's not too many followers up here 

486.37 487.45 A: right 

486.83 488.38 B: that i know of 

488.08 489.03 A: yeah 

488.45 491.87 B: you know maybe down in a larger area down on the coast 

492.16 493.62 B: [lipsmack] where the cities are 

493.66 499.48 B: you know they might have more there because they have access down so i guess they would be down in boston 

499.11 499.99 A: (( yeah mm i )) 

500.08 501.43 B: and um 

501.74 505.79 B: i think they got rid of that stadium and they built a new one or they are building a new one 

506.05 507.36 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

507.40 510.03 B: fox fox something i don't know what it was 

510.30 519.24 B: [mn] but [mn] other than that it's just baseball and you know what is it new york no not new york um boston red sox 

518.31 519.63 A: (( don't know yeah )) 

520.04 521.56 B: that's down there 

521.80 522.66 B: um 

522.22 526.13 A: yeah we don't have baseball down here so there's not much talk about that 

525.95 527.32 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

526.41 532.84 A: ac- actually has been trying to get a team but right now we don't have one so there's the baltimore orioles although 

533.24 536.80 A: i don't think they're that good i don't really know but 

534.69 535.63 B: no 

537.23 540.24 A: you don't hear much about them so i assume they're probably not that good 

539.95 544.79 B: no i don't really follow i used to follow the red sox 'cause i played baseball a lot when i was young 

544.40 545.26 A: yeah 

544.97 546.87 B: and we used to go up to fenway but 

547.41 550.80 B: i don't know every just they don't seem to win too much [laughter] 

550.15 550.80 A: (( [laughter] )) 

552.03 555.86 B: kind of like the patriots it was a fluke i think they won that tournament 

555.73 560.88 A: yeah they they've been getting some some new good players i think lately they just got ah 

561.03 564.11 A: a great new quarterback from my alma mater michigan 

563.96 564.76 B: really 

564.43 567.80 A: so ah they may have a good future ahead 

565.42 566.03 B: (( mm )) 

567.90 568.78 B: (( mm i hope )) 

570.12 572.17 B: (( so other than that ah )) 

572.32 572.96 B: mm 

574.91 575.85 B: um 

576.30 579.46 A: so is soccer is getting big in your area then 

579.13 584.30 B: yes it is yeah um surprisingly hockey is just starting again 

579.92 581.11 A: yeah 

584.06 584.78 A: (( oh )) 

584.56 588.88 B: i would think because of the winters and you know being 

589.20 598.35 B: snow climate and ice and everything but there wasn't a big i think there's only two arenas two um ice hockey arenas [lipsmack] 

597.28 598.39 A: (( yeah that is strange )) 

598.60 599.89 B: it is yeah
