400.42 401.51 A: mhm 

401.28 413.61 B: that was finally closed after a multitude of years of running there and of course all the rides were split up and it was really hard to find

455.54 456.71 B: it is 

455.69 458.02 A: i thought that it was a big business uh-huh 

458.04 465.63 B: it's a big business but you have to be very careful and meticulous if you're going to au- restore it authentically 

465.31 467.46 A: right yeah that's true 

466.57 467.41 B: so

521.83 523.46 A: have you been doing it long 

525.12 526.13 A: mhm 

525.89 532.64 B: so i assume what they're doing they're probably tracking speech patterns because they're so different around the country 

532.37 533.43 A: mhm 

532.73 536.70 B: like yeah what's really interesting is uh 

536.71 538.19 B: where i'm from 

537.84 538.87 A: mhm 

538.67 542.51 B: the speech patterns of people from upstate new york 

542.40 543.44 A: mhm 

542.81 545.24 B: are different from those in syracuse 

545.36 548.81 B: and that's maybe fifty miles away 

545.75 548.21 A: oh right 

548.60 549.81 A: mhm 

549.62 556.41 B: so it's pretty interesting i know there are professors that make a serious study of that type of thing 

555.41 556.63 A: mhm 

556.53 560.87 B: and ah my husband is from tennessee 

560.66 562.29 A: mhm 

560.93 572.46 B: and he and his brother grew up in the same town but carl moved a bit away and his brother stayed around nashville whereas carl moved 

565.21 566.51 A: mhm 

572.59 579.00 B: well he stayed in mcmindoe and the var- it's a distinct pattern in the speech 

574.44 575.41 A: mhm 

578.58 580.64 A: mhm definitely 

579.37 584.12 B: you can tell putting them side by side even though they were brothers and grew up together 

583.95 585.45 A: mhm 

584.38 593.62 B: you put them side by side and talk to them and you can find a definite difference in their speech patterns and some of the words they use 

590.75 591.85 A: mhm 

593.22 595.57 A: yeah well around here there's 

595.96 599.89 A: such a unique accent that you actually you know you'll see it on t._v.
