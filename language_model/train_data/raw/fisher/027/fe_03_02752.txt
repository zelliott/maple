48.68 50.55 A: oh yeah 

51.59 63.17 B: someone offered well because if you're away from home you get to see your home team but it seems like [mn] everybody in the world who picks up a football is on television

120.14 135.09 B: it's uh well you didn't know what it was yeah right just people don't know like maybe the olympics does something like that but even then olympics coverage in this country is so badly done you gotta get up at four o'clock in the morning to see to see something 

122.59 123.52 A: yeah 

132.14 135.30 A: [laughter] [laughter] exactly to see what you wanna see 

135.46 140.80 A: yeah i don't even i don't even hardly watch any of the olympics i just get so tired of 

138.53 139.55 B: (( do you golf ))

141.29 147.98 A: it's just i just get tired of it all [laughter] my husband he watches golf and he 

143.26 144.99 B: yeah really really 

147.19 150.50 B: oh really i was just gonna i was asking about that yeah 

148.02 148.79 A: he 

149.74 158.94 A: yeah he golfs himself and then he does enjoy watching it but like if football would be on he would watch football first um

171.13 172.93 A: yeah the rest is just even 

173.69 175.86 A: (( golf is dreadfully boring [laughter] i mean it's one ))

177.91 180.06 B: yeah yeah yeah 

178.93 183.65 A: (( if you watch it on a screen it's just i i just it's worthless [laughter] yeah )) 

183.33 192.18 B: it is it really is it's 'cause i've i've always felt that the the the popularity of professional sports even college sports 

192.30 197.64 B: because there's so many people mainly guys i guess who are unhappy with their their work 

197.65 207.18 B: their life that it's like a vicarious experience and and and if you've seen one really good game you've seen 'em all 

200.88 201.91 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

206.49 207.75 A: exactly 

207.44 212.51 B: uh but golf i i i i've had the masters on because 

213.10 218.01 B: when you look at it it's very it's very attractive it's nice it's easy on the eyes

225.02 226.41 B: and um 

226.43 227.17 A: (( [noise] )) 

227.02 241.19 B: there's something to it but i mean i myself spend a lot of time on my feet [lipsmack] for my work so i don't really need the exercise of golf though i i sort of admire the idea of walking you know eighteen holes on a nice day but 

237.73 239.31 A: yeah [laughter] 

240.67 242.22 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

241.20 247.21 B: uh yeah the the the um the empathy just isn't there it's um

273.41 274.46 A: okay 

278.52 284.93 A: see we we don't watch any except for when my husband watches sports i mean that is why we have a t._v. 

282.67 283.71 B: oh really 

284.73 285.85 B: yeah that's 

285.19 288.58 A: for the sports so what does that say [laughter] 

286.24 286.91 B: (( well it's )) 

287.88 290.30 B: a good life you know it's a 

289.37 297.75 A: but uh but there are certain seasons that yeah it can go months without getting turned on because like i said he doesn't watch baseball or basketball 

297.85 299.04 B: where do you live hockey 

297.88 301.11 A: oh he watches hockey i forgot about hockey 

299.46 300.22 B: (( hockey )) 

300.95 302.51 B: right yeah 

301.45 303.57 A: oh my word how could i forget that 

303.37 305.81 B: hockey is really big where where do you live 

305.36 311.22 A: well i live only an hour from philly [laughter] so yeah he's a philly fires fan 

307.97 308.75 B: okay 

311.34 318.63 B: yeah yeah that yeah this is a very good sports town it's a really good sports town i mean it's just i've had clients here 

312.12 313.95 A: and uh yeah we've 

316.11 317.35 A: yeah 

318.66 331.62 B: who stay over the weekend or stay the night to be able to go to a basketball game or a hockey game or once in a while a ball game uh and they know they can't get into a football game 'cause all the tickets are sold but 

323.09 324.04 A: yeah 

330.64 331.51 A: yeah 

333.35 338.32 B: yeah it's it's a it's a very philly is really a sports town it's amazing 

337.97 348.86 A: yeah [laughter] so yeah so hockey that is something i can watch um [noise] because that's fast paced and every now and then you do get a fight and [laughter] [sigh] yeah 

338.61 342.71 B: (( um yeah )) 

346.29 347.75 B: [laughter] 

348.73 351.23 B: reason for watching is to see a fight 

350.67 363.19 A: well [laughter] oh no i guess not but [laughter] no my husband used to play hockey and then when he had children and and his wife wanted him to be home more then he had to resort to watching it on t._v. 

361.03 361.99 B: right 

363.09 364.61 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

363.56 367.47 A: so i guess that's one good thing about [laughter] sports on t._v. 

365.78 366.51 B: yeah 

367.31 368.29 B: right 

368.36 382.74 B: well i mean hockey used to be before it was really popular like in the fifties i this was when i was a lit- really little kid i was almost an infant but like in the sixties i i watched some real hockey games and i thought they were kinda boring because 

382.96 385.78 B: there wasn't the fighting it was like 

385.16 386.51 A: [laughter] 

386.13 388.58 B: being able to skate so fast 

388.11 389.21 A: yeah 

388.78 393.60 B: so i guess gracefully that you could avoid physical contact 

392.99 394.11 A: yeah 

393.77 398.32 B: you'd make the goal but it wasn't a popular game until it got violent 

397.99 399.63 A: really are you serious 

399.60 401.02 B: yeah really and 

399.65 402.06 A: (( that's shameful [laughter] )) 

401.33 413.09 B: yeah yeah there's a there's a movie with paul paul newman called slapshot which is about the transition it's about how how the game in order to bring in the crowds uh they got violent you know 

405.55 406.42 A: yeah 

409.75 410.53 A: yeah 

412.34 413.91 A: i didn't know that 

413.63 415.40 B: yeah yeah 

414.17 419.54 A: that that is pretty bad isn't it reminds me of the you know back in [sigh] 

415.97 417.63 B: yeah yeah 

419.71 424.45 A: back in the earlier centuries with the gladiators i mean that's pretty bad [laughter] 

422.30 423.69 B: (( well yeah yeah but )) 

424.30 428.90 B: well it's you know a spectator sport yeah i mean it's it's definitely for spectators 

425.94 426.86 A: yeah 

428.69 429.59 A: yeah 

428.97 438.54 B: but i just figure if you if you can't play the game even on an amateur level or just among friends you know what's the big thrill about watching it i just don't understand you know but 

436.34 437.16 A: (( yeah )) 

438.06 441.89 A: no i i can't relate either so we're just no help here are we 

441.93 443.26 B: [laughter] 

442.67 444.65 A: [laughter] [sigh] 

443.38 448.94 B: well you know it's well it it the the this your first or your second or your third call 

448.71 452.66 A: this is my third so i'm almost done [laughter] i mean 

450.10 450.86 B: okay 

452.68 459.08 B: the first the uh this is my second one the last one was about you know do you like to eat in a restaurant and 

457.68 460.03 A: oh my goodness i could've handled that one 

459.55 464.23 B: yeah well that was that was kind of interesting 'cause philadelphia as you probably know is a very good restaurant town 

463.78 465.07 A: yeah 

464.50 467.14 B: and i was talking to a guy in san fran- in l._a. 

466.70 467.71 A: okay 

467.50 480.95 B: and he was talking about how he always ate out 'cause he just didn't like to cook and i said well you know cooking a good meal is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself but it was both these these topics were sort of off the off the the chart for me 'cause i thought 

480.67 487.29 A: [mn] well all of mine have been so far my first one was reality shows on t._v. which i don't watch 

481.33 482.14 B: (( i just )) 

486.10 487.79 B: right okay 

487.49 493.60 A: and the second one was oh in iraq [laughter] well how i feel about what's going on over there well 

492.62 495.52 B: oh really they got political okay all right 

494.57 499.23 A: yeah [laughter] yeah so uh yeah it's interesting [lipsmack] 

498.52 499.93 B: yeah 

499.62 504.24 A: so anyway let's see our time surely is about up 

503.64 511.30 B: well i think they'll tell us um but do you actually do do you and your husband come in to town to to see a game specifically for that 

509.38 519.51 A: yeah no we never have no my sons are they're only seven and five and he keeps telling them that when they get a little older he wants to take 'em but they're too young yet to be worth the money 

513.74 514.58 B: uh-huh 

515.62 516.41 B: (( right )) 

517.08 518.02 B: sure 

519.22 521.71 B: yeah really yeah really really 

520.22 525.12 A: so and with the traffic and all the hassle it's just you know we haven't did it yet 

523.28 524.87 B: (( right right )) 

524.97 528.60 B: yeah yeah the closer you get the tougher it becomes that's for sure 

525.87 526.51 A: (( but )) 

528.06 529.22 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

528.75 533.84 B: and it is- it isn't cheap that's another thing is it seems to me that in in an- in another era 

534.31 541.42 B: going to a ball game was affordable or going to a spectator sport was an affordable thing um and i guess it 

536.59 537.40 A: yeah 

540.49 541.83 A: maybe that 

541.88 545.44 A: maybe that's why there's so much sports on tv [laughter] 

542.15 542.81 B: (( yeah )) 

544.96 547.09 B: (( well it it is )) 

546.10 547.97 A: can't afford to go to the real thing 

547.84 559.02 B: well it's that that's for the owners who get back big revenue from the t._v. sales so i mean the whole thing about sports being a business now is what's i think taken a lot of the sport out of sport [mn] 

552.63 553.38 A: yeah 

557.88 560.52 A: yeah oh i agree and i think that's a 

560.55 562.16 A: dirty shame but 

561.54 568.31 B: yeah 'cause it used to be limited just to a box of wheaties you'd get your picture on on the cover of wheaties now everywhere 

565.71 566.61 A: yeah 

567.68 568.78 A: yeah 

568.54 569.58 B: so 

569.20 573.28 A: yeah it's kinda sick but [laughter] that's life 

572.86 574.27 B: yeah 

573.91 575.11 A: (( so [sigh] )) 

576.02 577.66 A: yes well 

577.63 583.96 B: [laughter] i don't know i don't know what either of us could say much more on the subject [laughter] 

578.60 579.61 A: [laughter] 

581.79 588.47 A: [laughter] growing up did your father or your brothers watch sports 

587.71 599.89 B: no no i was an only child and my parents were divorced and my dad wasn't around he i i did see my dad eventually later but he was he was sort of 

589.69 590.58 A: okay 

592.73 593.67 A: okay
