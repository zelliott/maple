103.46 111.19 B: i'd like to change if you possibly could would be to have peace throughout the world and i don't think we'll ever ever have that 

110.51 113.41 A: no that's a dream everyone wishes but 

112.38 115.55 B: yes so if there was something we could 

114.26 116.28 A: very far off dream 

115.69 122.54 B: yes very far off you know if there were something we could change it would it would probably be that 

123.15 125.33 B: but i don't see how

127.18 129.09 B: yes yes 

129.26 132.81 B: but at least things are looking a little brighter right now 

132.18 135.03 A: yeah they are at least the war in iraq is over 

134.69 135.88 B: yeah 

135.24 137.41 A: that's always a good thing 

136.81 142.23 B: unless it flairs up again and and bin laden takes off or something like that 

141.89 145.81 A: yeah [sigh] yeah i'm hoping hoping that doesn't happen 

145.77 150.16 B: oh right mhm well we always go to europe in the summer 

150.64 158.03 B: we've been going for about the past twelve years but this year we're forgetting about that and staying in this country for vacations 

157.81 158.94 A: oh wow 

159.16 164.03 B: right it's it's still a little scary i think to go over there 

163.42 169.84 A: yeah oh it is it is when my par- my parents went over there in the fall i was you know worried every minute [laughter] until they landed 

169.30 171.03 B: yes yes 

170.40 175.87 A: and just you know worried every time you know they were they didn't like call when they said they were 

175.47 176.54 B: mhm 

176.60 188.82 B: right well with the time difference and all when you say you're going to [sigh] uh you know call at a certain time it's pretty hard then you know to make sure you get it right and then you can't always get through i know that 

188.43 191.87 A: yeah so it's just it's nice it's 

192.03 196.26 A: i don't know it's hard living in a world where you always have to worry about everything 

195.68 196.80 B: right 

196.97 209.48 B: well we went to uh mardi gras this year on a cruise because we didn't want to leave the country well we did uh go to mexico well anyway you know you can't lock your suitcases in in uh the airport anymore 

209.60 210.34 A: no 

210.09 216.05 B: no so we didn't lock them and they went through the suitcases and they put plastic locks on them 

216.61 218.61 B: so okay that was fine 

218.52 231.94 B: and [cough] of course you can't take any scissors or nail clippers with you which we didn't but we got our suitcases when we boarded the ship and we could not get those little plastic locks off you needed something to cut them 

229.84 230.93 A: (( oh oh gee [cough] )) 

231.41 232.62 A: (( pardon me )) 

232.43 246.04 B: so then finally we got someone uh we got the steward for our cabin and asked you know for scissors well i wish you would have seen the scissors he brought us oh a great big pair of scissors [laughter] and they couldn't even i don't think cut butter 

242.54 243.75 A: oh gee 

243.78 245.50 A: bolt cutters [laughter] 

246.13 251.59 B: and so we you know tried to saw away and we finally got them off 

251.34 252.36 A: oh wow 

252.51 254.91 B: right mhm 

255.23 256.87 A: that's amazing 

255.38 256.29 B: right 

256.72 264.30 B: so if we could change the uh something we would have peace throughout throughout the world which is almost impossible [sigh] 

263.41 266.67 A: yes it would be nice it's always a nice dream to hold on to 

266.17 270.82 B: [noise] you know at the news today though they're going to talk in israel and palestine 

271.13 279.12 B: which is is a little encouraging but you know they've been fighting for centuries and centuries i mean you know [laughter] this is nothing new 

278.70 279.57 A: no 

280.19 285.19 A: no it just no no it just seems anytime it gets better it just gets worse 

284.80 291.09 B: right you know you read your your bible from biblical times i mean there there was always fighting there 

286.58 287.19 A: [noise] 

290.92 296.42 A: yeah there was always fighting always wars like throughout the history of mankind [laughter] there's been wars 

296.02 300.06 B: but i really think we should keep our nose out of those things 

299.65 301.02 A: [sigh] yeah 

300.43 303.82 B: you know we can't be the keeper of the whole world 

304.01 305.61 A: no no no that's 

305.21 308.85 B: and and it seems that's what we try to do anymore 

309.03 312.86 A: mhm yeah you try to uh just make sure everyone's doing their thing 

312.48 313.46 B: right 

313.52 314.34 A: [noise] 

313.75 314.72 B: right 

315.46 317.46 B: but it's pretty hard [laughter] 

316.86 318.64 A: [cough] oh it is it's 

318.96 324.45 A: very hard [laughter] and um sure the u._s. gets a lot of slack about that 

324.07 329.57 B: well you know when you travel before i always have a little flag pin that i always wear 

330.15 333.23 B: [mn] and when we were going last year we went to france 

333.20 341.62 B: and my mother said to me oh you don't have your pin on she says i'll give you this one you can put on your jacket i said no thank you mother 

341.51 354.54 B: i said they don't like americans no matter where you go anymore but i mean you just want to sort of blend in with the crowd you know before you would be waving the flag and say you know i'm american not anymore 

344.93 346.13 A: yeah 

354.44 356.93 A: no no now it's canadians who can do that [laughter] 

356.83 358.37 B: [laughter] 

357.40 359.57 A: it seems they like canadians in europe 

359.72 362.79 B: [sigh] they they don't like the americans anymore 

362.63 363.98 A: no no i 

363.18 364.83 B: no matter where you go 

364.98 371.25 A: no i don't [sigh] i think poss- part of the thing is they don't see it as america's trying to 

371.11 372.10 B: help 

371.49 374.83 A: help they see it as america's just trying to bully everyone else 

374.28 378.70 B: right in- interfere with everything yeah exactly 

376.27 377.36 A: yeah 

377.93 380.34 A: and a lot of people don't like that i 

379.43 382.67 B: i uh no and you can't blame them in a way 

382.74 383.73 B: right 

383.53 389.74 A: don't know why france is so rude like if it wasn't for the u._s. you know france wouldn't be where it is now because of world war two 

388.36 389.26 B: yes 

389.42 394.08 B: that's right and boy they didn't support us at all when we wanted to go into iraq 

393.71 394.50 A: no 

394.29 395.60 B: no mhm

397.38 398.48 B: right 

398.50 406.69 B: but uh oh i think the first time we went over to france oh it's been maybe fifteen years ago and they didn't even like us then
