70.98 74.40 B: oh yeah yeah how about you what what would you open 

72.26 73.17 A: yeah 

74.08 81.07 A: you know what it was it's funny because like a lot of um me and my friends have actually been like brainstorming a lot lately 

80.86 89.53 A: and we've looked into like gas stations [noise] but here in san diego it's not really a feasible uh business and chevron is like three million 

89.46 96.54 A: but um depending on the locations we've [noise] also w- i i think i would either open up like a jumba juice 

96.74 98.03 B: oh cool 

97.35 108.95 A: only because it's it gets really hot over here and um the area that we live uh there's not that many jumba juices around and a lotta people are are searching for like healthy alt- alternatives to 

100.58 102.00 B: yeah 

104.75 105.88 B: really 

109.35 119.99 A: so i think down here in the area that i'm in j- a jumba juice would really work out but the m- my- me and my friends have also been looking at like those have you heard of those boba teas 

114.48 115.32 B: (( yeah )) 

119.79 122.81 B: yeah yeah they're really good 

120.75 125.49 A: yeah yeah it's kinda like a a coffee house except it's a tea house 

125.53 130.33 A: and they yeah those things g- it's na- it's the new fad now 

125.67 126.82 B: yeah 

130.37 131.60 A: (( [lipsmack] and uh )) 

130.64 132.53 B: yeah i guess it is yeah 

132.79 133.79 A: (( huh )) 

133.00 144.09 B: i have um a w- my boyfriend um went to school in hong kong so she's he's like really into chinese foo- or you know asian food and i had never had it before and they're really good 

136.96 137.75 A: uh-huh 

140.80 141.66 A: (( right yeah )) 

143.44 147.59 A: [laughter] all the kids it's like the highest rave 

144.69 146.14 B: yeah they're really good 

147.69 151.61 B: i know i don't know why i [mn] it's cool though they're very different 

151.16 163.19 A: yeah yeah it's just fun i i don't know though i mean i i just hope that they don't get any like m- m- they don't get sued or anything 'cause you can choke on those things [laughter] that's the only thing 

151.98 153.10 B: definitely 

163.20 164.77 B: really oh 

163.92 173.30 A: [sigh] yeah like uh that's the only that i see and so you know 'cause if you suck one up and you don't expect it gulp you know 

168.47 169.20 B: you could 

171.55 177.80 B: yeah [laughter] you could put a little warning on the on the lid like mcdonald's does 

173.43 174.37 A: so 

175.80 177.05 A: yeah 

177.18 180.13 A: yeah oh they do some of you've seen them 

180.22 181.49 A: or we could 

180.95 189.77 B: oh no i haven't seen like a warning or anything but like mcdonald's that court case that you know the coffee was too hot so they had to write it and 

183.20 184.17 A: oh 

185.16 186.03 A: yeah 

188.59 191.29 A: oh yeah that's true yeah that's true 

190.62 193.60 B: you just write it on the lid and then you're not liable 

193.22 194.94 A: right that 

193.95 199.97 B: but why will what you were saying that it's hard to start a gas station at n- in san diego 

199.51 213.55 A: yeah 'cause they really like the city doesn't really like it it's like um that's what i wa- that i was talking to someone and chevron and then that's pretty much why the gas prices [noise] here in san diego aren't [noise] too good 'cause in l._a. they're a little bit cheaper 

205.06 206.04 B: (( oh )) 

213.55 227.28 A: i mean they're still like astronomically [noise] priced but uh compared to the rest [laughter] of the nation but then like um at least it's cheaper over there 'cause there's more competition you see gas stations in l._a. and [noise] long beach pretty much on every corner [noise] but 

213.82 214.81 B: yeah 

226.54 228.52 B: yeah it's true yeah 

227.55 234.71 A: yeah but over here it's like it's really difficult to [noise] obtain like [noise] um mm you know like uh 

233.81 236.41 B: (( wow that's really interesting liquor licence )) 

234.80 246.41 A: facilities [noise] so it cost like about two or three million dollars [noise] yeah and then most of the [noise] most of the profit actually comes from the convenience store and the ga- and the car wash 

239.65 240.85 B: wow 

246.72 251.26 A: i think [noise] sixty percent of the profit comes from the car wash [noise] so 

247.27 248.57 B: (( wow )) 

250.30 251.90 B: that's really crazy 

251.47 258.94 A: yeah so i was like even thinking just buy the lot [noise] and just get a car wash and [laughter] you know make money off that [laughter] so 

255.86 257.91 B: yeah seriously 

258.13 261.98 B: californians are so obsessed about washing their car 

261.73 263.24 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

262.63 267.27 B: i have never i i'm from the east coast and i just have never noticed [laughter] it before 

266.16 273.25 A: oh yeah yeah i'm from new york too and and yeah 'cause of the weather it's not really that practical to do so 

268.63 269.86 B: but oh really 

273.42 274.40 B: no 

273.58 282.39 A: you know it's so cold and then you know you're just working and you know by the time you get home it's like daylight and then well there's a lot of people just mass commuting too 

274.66 275.72 B: (( yeah )) 

282.65 287.54 B: [sigh] yeah that's [noise] and it rains it rains out there more than it does out here 

283.91 285.15 A: you know but of 

286.90 296.18 A: true yeah that's true too and the change in season it snows and all that stuff but over here it's so sunny and people are more vain 

292.54 293.72 B: yeah 

296.58 298.16 B: (( [laughter] )) 

296.60 298.61 A: you know it's all about image 

298.29 300.13 B: (( yeah and )) 

298.76 301.47 A: you should know you're in la [laughter] 

300.91 304.60 B: yeah i know i know i know [laughter] 

303.50 312.93 A: mm but another thing too is a lot of people are stressed out another business that um is really good and booming is like spas i've seen them popping up all over the place 

312.86 313.89 B: really 

313.41 324.04 A: yeah health spas or just like you know just just like for pampering yourself and uh day spas and it's become really quite the roar out here 

324.34 326.20 A: so all the girls like 

324.99 325.96 B: (( well )) 

326.63 334.48 A: doing that but i don't know i mean i i like old fashioned things too 'cause me and my friends love to make these [noise] pecan tarts the homemade ones 

333.71 336.67 B: (( oh really oh that that'd be really good )) 

334.62 337.54 A: yeah and you can't really buy them anywhere 

337.57 338.66 A: (( [noise] [lipsmack] so i was )) 

337.83 339.29 B: i've never seen one 

339.11 341.20 A: oh the pecan tarts 

340.44 341.11 B: (( no )) 

341.20 342.89 B: no i've never heard of one 

341.30 342.04 A: (( no )) 

342.81 352.30 A: oh like um [noise] it's just like a little pastry and uh and we make them all the time for like christmas [noise] and special events and [noise] stuff and and um 

352.41 363.17 A: and i was thinking 'cause [mn] if we package them really nicely and stuff i wonder how much we would be able to make it it does cost a lot of money because the pecans are expensive um and it so 

361.98 365.52 B: yeah but it you have like health foods or um 

364.49 366.81 A: right [noise] right it 

365.78 368.39 B: you could probably distribute there 

367.83 375.67 A: yeah and so i was thinking about doing that because you know we lo- we just love to make it and [noise] with any business i think you've gotta go with your passion 

368.50 370.37 B: those type of stores hm 

376.00 376.71 A: (( [noise] )) 

376.06 377.59 B: oh definitely yeah yeah 

376.88 385.16 A: you know and 'cause in if you know if you're not willing to get up and you dread it then it's just like going to work like um uh doing the rat race and everything 

385.59 390.56 A: so but [mn] yeah if money wasn't the issue i'd probably 

385.74 386.87 B: (( i know i know yeah )) 

390.69 404.60 A: do my pecan tarts business of all the businesses that we've we've done my friends are also like um interested in doing a restaurant business which would be fun but i also know that like uh it takes [noise] at least five years [noise] before you actually turn a profit 

405.07 420.01 B: bu- yeah it's true um i've opened a restaurant and the cost of not not my own restaurant but i've worked for um there's a team called flemings steak house and they opened um they hired out this new management and i- it was like 

420.01 423.73 B: it must have been millions of dollars it cost just to start the place 'cause you have to 

423.22 424.05 A: [noise] 

423.92 429.99 B: buy all the furniture the kitchen and the supplies and pay all your staff and train everybody and 

425.69 426.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

428.93 432.35 A: right the expenses and yeah 

430.10 431.22 B: (( i don't know )) 

431.45 443.69 B: i worked at i worked at this um restaurant and hotel it was a like a bed and breakfast and a french bistro and they uh made most of their money off the hotel they didn't make any money off the food 

438.23 439.04 A: uh-huh 

443.17 445.74 A: (( the re- yeah yeah )) 

445.83 449.39 A: yeah [noise] i've heard that i mean like that's why junior 

446.37 447.30 B: (( um )) 

449.95 454.11 A: um actually has a restaurant because it's pretty much a tax shelter 

454.48 455.84 B: oh really 

455.20 462.06 A: yeah a lot of a lot of people that ha- make a lotta money they open up restaurants because it's a great tax shelter 

462.81 463.63 A: yeah 

462.85 469.42 B: [lipsmack] you know yeah i've just started reading fast food nation and there was a a lot of about that how to get a lot of 

469.47 471.80 B: money back from the government from hiring 

471.34 473.30 A: [noise] uh-huh yeah 

472.31 475.11 B: (( fast food restaurants too i don't know about regular restaurants )) 

475.18 481.58 A: actually like uh if you open up like a subway it only costs seventy five grand to open up your own franchise 

475.53 476.56 B: (( i'm trying to get )) 

478.29 478.92 B: (( mhm ))

514.36 515.39 B: yeah
