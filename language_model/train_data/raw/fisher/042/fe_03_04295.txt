36.20 44.52 A: [laughter] it's like i would love to go back to high school if i know now if i knew then what i know now i think i would i'd would do things 

44.89 48.65 A: completely differently from the time i was like starting high school 

48.74 51.49 B: yes i would agree i would do um 

52.13 55.55 B: yes i agree in high school [laughter] yeah 

54.52 59.74 A: i mean i don't even i don't even keep i haven't talked to anybody from high school in like years 

59.99 67.01 B: yeah i have um actually ran into a couple people i went to high school and they were the type that um 

67.38 78.69 B: i guess they were popular and liked to party and um but unfortunately they're still like that [laughter] they're now they look kind of bad and like this [sigh] i don't know 

70.16 70.73 A: (( mm )) 

76.04 77.39 A: [laughter] 

77.50 79.46 A: (( have you have you ah )) 

79.54 87.03 A: like have you like seen people that like on a reunions and stuff that you've seen people from high school and seen how different they are 

86.41 93.81 B: i um i just recent oh i had a um [lipsmack] and i graduated in nineteen eighty one so it was our twentieth but i did not go 

91.53 92.38 A: mhm 

93.81 103.67 B: um so i live close to the city where i did graduate and my husband works in that area and so a lot of people it's a small town 

103.45 104.15 A: (( ah [noise] )) 

103.68 109.89 B: so a lot of people run into each other so um just through passing and then a lot have moved out so um [sigh] 

105.28 106.72 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

110.56 111.79 B: but um 

112.38 126.35 B: talking about the subject is maybe possibly um the things that i did i'd probably act differently [laughter] now that i'm older i can understand why my mom told me [laughter] not to do that [laughter] but ah since i have kids now [laughter] but um 

124.73 125.58 A: (( mm )) 

126.40 127.25 B: anyway 

127.20 133.35 A: yeah i know well see i never got married and it i mean i still may but i mean it's just 

132.80 134.15 B: mhm 

133.46 137.53 A: when i was in high school i was a total nerd so 

137.03 138.82 B: mhm 

138.29 146.90 A: it you know knowing actually if i'd known that being a nerd would be so profitable today i probably wouldn't have tried so hard to not be one 

146.18 148.22 B: [laughter] 

148.26 151.29 A: [laughter] wouldn't a mind being bill gates now [laughter] 

151.19 153.91 B: [laughter] yeah really that would be great [laughter] 

152.85 154.92 A: wouldn't be the worst thing in the world 

154.70 156.28 B: right right 

155.67 157.78 A: but you know it it's 

157.79 162.47 A: it's funny how you you look back i mean i look back at pictures and things like that and go 

161.53 162.41 B: mhm 

162.54 164.50 A: oh god what was i thinking 

164.04 165.28 B: mhm 

164.75 165.92 A: (( you you know i )) 

165.51 167.78 B: (( one of the greatest things um )) 

167.94 170.34 B: is that um 

170.81 183.57 B: that i have changed since i was in high school um i don't know how you feel about this but i i became a christian so [sigh] that has made my awareness um a lot greater than how i was when i was in high school so [laughter] 

182.07 182.81 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

182.97 186.50 A: well i went to catholic s- catholic high school so i mean i kind of 

184.32 186.18 B: (( mm mm )) 

186.79 191.12 A: actually it's kind of funny 'cause i've kind of gone for a full circle i was a i wasn't 

191.46 201.55 A: real religious but i mean w- i went to church and the whole thing while i was in s- in high school then i went off to college and really from that point on i really kinda started to 

201.61 204.18 A: drift further and further away 

203.64 204.84 B: mhm 

204.22 207.16 A: and in the last year i've i've actually 

207.24 211.22 A: gone back and ah my 

208.43 210.02 B: (( mm )) 

211.31 213.95 A: girlfriend soon to be fiancee 

214.03 217.87 A: it was part of the catalyst for that and we go to church every week 

217.41 218.58 B: mhm 

217.95 220.28 A: and i hadn't done that in 

220.48 221.60 A: oh god 

221.67 224.23 A: [laughter] twenty five years maybe 

222.09 223.17 B: mhm 

223.78 225.19 B: mhm 

224.38 230.33 A: so for me it it's kind of funny it it but you're right it does give you more perspective 

229.91 231.77 B: right right and um 

232.34 233.63 B: um 

233.77 238.75 B: yes 'cause it changed it my life and it um 'cause i know with and i have four children now and 

239.20 243.60 B: things in school it's oh so much different than when we went to school i mean um 

242.22 243.97 A: oh god yeah 

243.65 251.87 B: the way um you know drugs is a issue um i mean kids are having like sex in fifth and sixth grade and um 

250.29 251.59 A: (( oh i know )) 

252.72 259.63 B: um we're you know i fifth and sixth graders never even heard [laughter] of that when we went to school so um 

259.95 273.48 B: you know it's that's kinda sad so i i'm thankful that um hopefully raising my kids now i could um instill in them so that way when they get through it because i think peer pressure's a lot harder now and um 

273.59 277.94 B: circumstances are a lot different and um i think it's rougher to be a 

278.04 279.74 B: a kid now so 

278.90 288.44 A: mhm i guess if i were to go back i'd a guess the easy answer would be to say well gee i would invest in company a b. c. and d. [laughter] like [laughter] you know i guess 

286.21 289.93 B: yes yeah choose who i'd hang around with um [sigh] 

289.33 299.96 A: yeah ah but i guess you know having a lot of money isn't necessarily the answer too 'cause i've i've known people who've who've had enormous amounts of money and who are miserable 

299.65 300.75 B: mhm 

300.14 309.70 A: so i mean going back and changing that and and completely having more money than i would have ever needed wouldn't necessarily have 

309.80 312.25 A: made my life better it would have been different 

312.56 318.04 A: but i don't know if it's necessarily i would say it could it would definitely be better 

314.25 314.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

317.81 319.13 B: (( [noise] right )) 

318.43 323.40 A: i mean i i don't regret most of the things i've done i just wish i had done them 

321.76 322.74 B: mhm 

323.84 324.92 B: mhm 

324.29 330.59 A: i guess i just wish i'd learned earlier and been more dedicated earlier i was too much of a goof off when i was a kid 

328.24 329.07 B: right 

329.95 343.66 B: yeah that's how um [lipsmack] one thing i think i would change is when i was going through high school i did not take no college prep classes [laughter] so when i went to college i had to retake all my classes 

337.92 338.97 A: oh 

343.71 353.08 B: and pay for 'em [sigh] so um that would definitely be one of the things that i would definitely take my studies more serious when i was in high school 

345.15 346.04 A: ooh 

351.20 352.02 A: (( yeah )) 

352.44 362.60 A: you know and i would too and it's funny but not quite for the same reason i took advanced placement i took all of those classes but when i was in high school it was too easy 

359.01 360.06 B: mhm 

361.47 363.69 B: (( mm )) 

362.75 364.96 A: and i never learned how to study 

364.77 365.82 B: (( right oh )) 

365.03 369.39 A: so when i went off to college i had no idea what to do 

368.19 369.18 B: mhm 

369.31 370.31 B: right 

369.70 378.56 A: and when when it wasn't easy anymore and it didn't come naturally i became frustrated and i didn't care and i got i just said ah 

373.88 374.95 B: mhm 

378.47 390.92 A: i'm gonna have fun i'm not going even worry about it and i ended up dropping out of dr- i ended up dropping out of college which was stupid and now i'm i'm remedying that and i'm back in school now i mean a long time afterwards but i 

379.71 381.23 B: right right 

383.30 384.99 B: (( mm )) 

386.84 387.94 B: right 

390.68 391.80 B: mhm 

391.16 394.22 A: i decided that it was something that i wanted to do for me 

393.49 395.57 B: right do you find it's harder 

395.92 397.01 B: going now 

396.19 398.73 A: in a way it's actually easier 

398.94 407.56 A: ah because i actually i i'm doing it for the right reasons at the time i was doing it because it was expected and that was what you were supposed to do 

402.60 404.05 B: right right 

405.02 406.36 B: right right 

407.04 408.73 B: (( right right )) 

408.13 411.14 A: i wasn't ready emotionally though i thought i was 

409.97 414.76 B: right yeah and i think it does make a i think if i went back to um 

414.95 417.98 B: [lipsmack] i only got associates when i went um [sigh] 

418.05 422.74 B: back and um well when i got outta school i didn't i only got associates 

422.24 423.10 A: mhm 

422.81 435.07 B: but i think if i do go if i went back now i definitely take it more serious and and i'd probably do better [laughter] you know so yeah i think i guess it has its pros and cons my husband's going back for his masters now and [laughter] it's really difficult 

434.59 435.78 A: oh yeah 

435.19 438.85 B: and um 'cause he's still working a fulltime job abd [noise] um 

439.00 445.01 B: and it's a very very expensive and um on top of that other family and i guess like when you're 

445.28 449.73 B: younger and you don't have a family and going to college it's a lot easier so 

449.04 455.86 A: oh that's true my my girlfriend did it while she was she got her masters while not only 

455.92 461.75 A: getting a divorce and being a single parent so that that was really really hard 

461.14 462.48 B: mhm 

461.76 470.82 A: but she had made the decision that's what she had wanted to do and she had started in the program before she got divorced but she wasn't gonna quit she 

468.58 469.58 B: mhm 

470.85 475.37 A: ended up getting her masters she you know she's you know she's a teacher 

472.96 474.06 B: (( yeah )) 

475.10 476.13 B: oh great 

475.57 481.31 A: and has been and and i know how hard it was for for her and she's been real encouraging for me 

479.23 480.12 B: mhm 

480.96 493.25 B: yeah yeah 'cause definitely i think that would be 'cause [sigh] um i know they have to do papers and [laughter] and nowadays you know when i went to school you could get by with associates or even 

487.06 488.23 A: oh i know 

493.26 506.55 B: um like i mentioned i think i graduated in eighty one that was like when a lot of people we live in the detroit area in um you had the big three and so people could go work in the factories and they made great money like right outta school at eighteen 

498.93 499.83 A: mhm 

504.54 505.30 A: oh 

506.10 507.07 A: wow 

506.52 518.05 B: great benefits and so people had a choice well either they could go there and um back then it was a very secure job working for the auto companies and make lots of money or go to college so [sigh] 

518.52 525.63 B: there was about a spilt now you can't get anywhere really with just associates or even a b. a. 

523.46 524.92 A: no you're right 

525.28 526.34 A: that's true 

525.68 536.79 B: and and then a masters and you know like where people going nursing and nurses have to continually you know like their education aspects and it's a continual education so um it's so much different so 

536.06 539.39 A: yeah i i think the hardest thing going back was 

539.53 544.67 A: learning how to learn and get your mind into that frame again 

544.82 552.08 A: it took me the first couple of classes to really start to get acclimated to just learning how to learn 

552.01 553.51 B: right right 

552.43 563.58 A: and it was it would seems kinda strange but but that was i think just getting your brain kinda gets lazy and you just kinda 'cause you're in the middle of your life and you do what you have to do 

560.04 560.92 B: right 

563.43 565.03 B: right right 

564.42 567.78 A: you don't really think about it and and just getting 

567.97 580.31 A: academic learning skills back or even maybe as in my case for the first time was really hard i still am not a great studier i don't i don't do it by the book 

569.64 570.70 B: mhm 

579.75 581.05 B: mhm 

580.43 582.79 A: but i just kinda like 

582.90 584.53 A: grunt my way though [laughter] 

583.64 586.62 B: mm are you going fulltime or 

585.96 597.11 A: well technically but it's it's a five we we ah we have a different class every five weeks so i'm considered fulltime but you know it's like a two year program with twenty classes 

591.47 592.66 B: okay 

593.60 594.96 B: (( right right )) 

596.54 598.04 B: right right 

597.35 599.89 A: you know and they and they cram it down [laughter] your throat 

599.21 599.95 B: right
