287.76 288.69 A: mhm 

289.08 290.32 A: yeah

292.42 293.30 A: right 

298.04 298.95 A: yeah 

299.94 306.61 A: [lipsmack] yeah exactly that's what i guess that's what [sigh] this topic is about time travel 

306.70 309.44 A: but uh you know you're visualizing the future 

309.72 320.42 B: that's right as you also can go back 'cause i do regression therapy where where we take people back in time and especially if they have a problem like a headache or something 

320.29 327.03 B: and we find out what happened uh to them why they have a headache or what was bothering them at the time or how they died 

323.74 324.58 A: (( [sigh] )) 

325.08 326.49 A: so

335.64 337.86 A: into the future and do that how 

338.46 344.75 B: [lipsmack] well er er the future is the past and the past is the future an- and it depends the way you believe 

344.57 345.78 A: mhm 

345.41 353.20 B: other words do you believe in reincarnation and by the way if you do i i never did but since i've been in hypnotherapy since nineteen eighty nine 

353.07 354.38 A: mhm 

353.36 358.84 B: i believe in reincarnation now and you only come back as a man or a woman you don't come back as an animal or a bug
