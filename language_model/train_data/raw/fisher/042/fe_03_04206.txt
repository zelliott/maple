39.31 40.44 A: what would you do 

48.68 62.21 A: right but the thing is that they can make some money off of it so i'm thinking i will open a a business that would help cut down on my gain just to keep it running as an organization because remember it says it doesn't matter whether you money isn't an issue

180.54 182.38 A: yeah 

182.97 189.45 A: uh let's see um i guess if i had any other choices i would definitely go with something that had to do with uh children 

189.66 191.29 B: yeah

241.41 251.32 A: little nicknames and slang basically slang they use a lot of slang and less english i would like to improve that to the point where they actually know the proper terminology as opposed to slang 

251.09 252.59 B: oh i see

299.38 301.10 A: right 

301.29 303.96 A: but we're so busy right now it's kind of um 

304.01 312.35 A: making sure that the mental status of our students is okay as opposed to elevating their education levels and we're actually stupefying the nation 

311.05 311.94 B: [noise] 

312.67 314.65 B: [noise] oh is that right 

314.38 326.25 A: yeah we're actually there there used to be like things called red group blue group or yellow group and according to your reading level you would be put into those groups so that you read at your level and you kept pr- progressing forward 

326.37 339.89 A: nowadays we're finding that we can't do that anymore because it hurts the feelings and eventually may scar the child so we have to get back to where we can you know keep them in the same classroom but at the same time stop being so sensitive to their 

337.00 338.13 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

339.14 340.18 B: (( [noise] [noise] ))
