95.74 96.71 B: uh-huh 

96.35 102.28 A: and i was just impatient to get a car so i just bought something i could afford 

100.53 101.38 B: did you 

101.66 103.64 B: did you do it right at sixteen 

103.88 104.68 A: (( huh ))

104.89 108.27 A: (( no no no no um like around like )) 

108.64 109.96 A: couple months ago 

110.20 111.56 B: couple months ago

113.07 115.21 B: (( ah okay )) 

114.31 115.32 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

115.71 123.52 B: oh so you are young [laughter] it's not like well you know what now's the time to to do those things [laughter] 

123.59 125.19 B: yeah i'm forty two 

125.33 129.32 B: so looking back my teens my twenties my thirties 

125.80 126.73 A: oh 

129.67 132.55 B: ah lotta things i probably would have done different but 

132.69 134.53 B: right now i'm really um 

134.92 138.25 B: i think forensic science is very interesting 

138.74 152.06 B: and um i would have loved to have gone into forensic and become a coroner to do autopsies 'cause it really interests me to find out why people died and 

152.08 153.00 B: um 

153.42 156.26 B: find out you know how they died if it was 

157.22 168.75 B: you know homicide or if it was definitely suicide or overdose or those things are really interesting to me just the medical field and i believe that's probably what i would have chose to do 

168.53 171.40 A: [noise] so you're not scared at all of like dead bodies 

171.17 171.96 B: that's 

171.50 172.65 A: or anything 

172.31 173.60 B: does it scare me 

173.44 174.45 A: yeah 

173.86 175.32 B: no not at all 

175.33 176.21 B: uh-huh 

176.60 187.13 B: i've seen i've seen dead people and um i've been a morgue and no it doesn't bother me at all at um a lotta people say that there's you know it takes a certain 

176.79 177.86 A: [noise] 

187.39 191.13 B: stomach to handle it and apparently that's what i have 

191.55 194.29 B: um i see i i look at it more as 

194.84 205.09 B: the fascination of finding out and you know the medical technology that we have today to figure those things out so i don't really look at it 

205.30 212.96 B: as a dead person i mean sure if it was it was hard when my father died to see my own father you know that touched me and that was really hard 

213.22 215.33 B: but i don't believe that 

215.65 217.84 B: [lipsmack] um just a 

218.56 229.64 B: a corpse [sigh] you know would really bother me maybe children would you know maybe just to see a little child but not to not the average person i don't think that would bother me at all 

230.07 231.20 A: oh 

231.39 232.06 A: (( that's )) 

231.92 233.15 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

234.78 235.86 A: (( good )) 

235.19 241.92 B: but and definitely put more money away because when i bought my first house i put the minimum amount down 

242.25 243.35 B: um 

243.53 249.08 B: and then after i sold it i never purchased another house for several years 

249.34 254.98 B: and had i taken the money i make off that house and just put it into another house 

255.48 257.60 B: it would have bought my payment down 

257.78 261.58 B: considerably because of what i've you know paid over the years 

262.21 264.81 B: um i just sold a house 

264.95 273.10 B: back east and um and they just they go up in value so much that it was a really good way to make money 

273.99 275.37 A: (( [noise] )) 

277.51 279.44 A: (( [noise] )) 

281.56 285.82 B: so nothing you would have would have done in the last nineteen years different huh 

281.80 282.76 A: (( [noise] ah mm )) 

286.17 291.43 A: oh yeah that's why [laughter] it's sorta kind of a tough question for me 

286.18 287.60 B: not really too much 

290.25 291.59 B: yeah 

291.67 294.56 A: (( yeah um )) 

299.82 300.80 B: i mean i've 

300.32 301.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

301.47 310.37 B: gotten married and gotten divorced after you know nine years i wouldn't change that because i have a great child i have a great son who's sixteen 

310.67 311.81 B: um 

311.76 313.65 A: (( [noise] )) 

311.88 315.79 B: so i wouldn't have changed that i worked for a company for twenty one years 

316.38 319.67 B: um you know had really good employment so 

319.71 323.50 B: you know that's probably a good thing but i i would have rather had a trade 

324.02 328.62 B: um gone to college and got a trade so there would always be something 

327.33 328.40 A: (( [noise] )) 

329.19 330.33 B: (( to do )) 

330.59 332.00 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

333.06 334.13 A: (( mm )) 

336.24 337.13 A: (( [sigh] )) 

337.15 340.33 A: i guess i don't regret like studying 

341.00 342.95 A: hard in high school 

344.12 345.25 B: not what 

344.46 345.37 A: 'cause it 

345.39 348.99 A: i i don't regret studying hard in high school 

348.86 350.37 B: (( mm yeah )) 

349.54 353.03 A: (( i went to a really physical high school and ah )) 

353.75 357.55 A: yeah i i could have chosen to go to another high school 

357.78 358.76 A: (( but a )) 

359.37 365.29 A: (( lot of my friends went to like to the high school in our area but )) 

365.91 372.23 A: like gone into the other one i i stayed there and 

370.81 372.26 B: it's hard though 

372.27 375.73 B: isn't it hard when you're in a high school to do well 

376.26 377.41 A: (( yeah it's )) 

377.76 392.00 B: i mean i say that with a my sixteen year old you know he i tried to tell him that today that he gets he brings home ds and fs and i said you know there's gonna be a time when you're not gonna have school anymore you only have two years left 

392.29 397.08 B: and you can't go back and repeat it so you might as well just do a good job now 

397.64 401.25 B: but he doesn't you know it's i think it's maybe just hard to 

401.33 403.70 B: for him to see that at this stage 

404.31 407.22 B: where you're already seeing that at nineteen 

407.43 409.79 B: and you can't go back and change it can't you 

410.05 412.99 A: i don't know i had a really s- strict parents 

412.98 413.92 B: uh-huh 

413.95 420.90 A: so i mean i had like no choice i guess 

421.74 424.07 A: i had very very very strict parents 

424.11 425.37 A: and um 

425.47 432.57 A: i don't know i could see myself like my mentality even kind of changed through high school and college like in high school 

432.71 438.55 A: it'd be them totally controlling me so i mean i had to study because i had no choice 

438.33 439.34 B: mhm 

438.59 443.58 A: because they sort of knew what was good for me and i i guess there was 

443.68 445.61 A: a couple months where i kind of 

445.64 448.79 A: that rebellion stage but i kind of saw how 

448.92 449.82 A: (( you know )) 

450.34 451.41 A: they 

451.55 458.74 A: would only want the best for me i just kinda agree with what they did but now that i'm in college it's like 

453.43 454.40 B: (( right mm )) 

459.01 465.18 A: i have a whole lot more freedom so i find myself like caring less about studying but 

465.56 468.53 A: still i do care but i just kinda 

468.72 471.48 A: because i have i have so much freedom [sigh] 

471.71 474.72 A: but i'm i'm beginning to see how 

474.80 477.96 A: i should study more like i did in high school 

477.86 479.44 B: it's important 

479.90 481.45 B: (( very important ))
