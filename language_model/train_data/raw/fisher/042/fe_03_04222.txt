370.39 381.22 B: seriously i mean i i i like to get everything out in the open that way the the bull crap'll be alleviated and i said to him look if you feel like you're not ready for this kind of relationship then let me know mind you 

381.04 388.46 B: four years ago when i was dealing with him he was different he was like more concerning more more catering to my needs 

381.78 386.26 A: mhm 

387.55 390.17 A: [lipsmack] oh so you'd gone out with him before

394.41 399.79 A: mhm 

398.50 407.74 B: [lipsmack] and the sad part about it's 'cause now they now he's like so cold and unfeeling and like if he says well i'm going to call you and then he don't call and stuff like that 

407.57 415.43 B: but like years ago he would call me he would just say hello just to see how i'm doing just to let me know hear his voice or hear my voice for that matter 

415.97 425.68 B: and now he doesn't and i'm like i if i could change that i wouldn't have never dealt with him i i would have kept the same person back then 'cause time change people change 

423.06 423.97 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

424.99 427.45 A: how long was it between times you went out with

437.84 445.48 A: [laughter] if that were only the case huh it's not always for the better unfortunately sometimes it is though 

441.22 442.84 B: mm yeah already 

443.85 445.03 B: exactly 

445.31 455.92 B: yeah well they say a lot of people i hear a lot of people say oh a leopard never change its spots but that's that's not always true some people people don't always change but they bend a little 

455.66 457.08 A: [laughter] that's true 

456.10 466.07 B: you know what i mean but [mn] i don't know then there's a lot of 'em that don't a lot of 'em just they're like for the worse you i'm i thought that experience would be the best teacher 

462.13 464.08 A: [laughter] 

465.78 467.65 A: mhm 

466.27 469.42 B: but apparently it's not in some cases 

468.14 481.04 A: [laughter] some people never learn oh you know you can i'm sure you can think of things that you know you've done that you would like to have learned from that you didn't i think everybody's got those kinda things 

477.57 479.16 B: (( [laughter] well )) 

480.32 485.76 B: that's true that's just like i um i've had like a child at a young age 

485.13 486.83 A: mhm 

485.85 487.23 B: you know um 

487.20 500.90 B: i love her i well i have two daughters i love yes i love them unconditionally but if i could change things back then i would i'd have had you know been all in love with the man and he's telling me oh i want you to have my baby 

489.31 490.67 A: [noise] two girls 

500.57 505.44 A: mhm yeah that's sad for the child too 

500.83 504.01 B: and then he wasn't even there you know what i mean 

505.55 517.40 B: exactly exactly and that's why i said you know i feel like you know back then and my mom was telling me like in her time when you got pregnant you know the guy would automatically marry you the parents didn't play that 

516.95 518.80 A: mhm 

517.58 522.35 B: you know what i mean you made your bed hard you lie in it but the man has to do his part 

522.66 527.35 B: and now they like abandon you they don't even acknowledge their own children 

526.84 530.83 A: [mn] well more than anything else i think that's one of the biggest problems in this country 

530.06 531.38 B: mhm 

530.93 545.53 A: 'cause i remember when i was growing up like what kept me in line is my dad [laughter] well my momma would have made no we had uh five boys five boys and a girl and you know while she did most of the raising my father was like the atomic bomb you never had to use him but 

534.51 535.54 B: really 

537.66 538.68 B: mhm 

542.16 543.01 B: mhm 

545.61 551.68 A: [laughter] just the fact that she might tell him you know kinda kept us from running roughshod over her we were good kids but 

547.47 548.40 B: right 

549.98 552.08 B: (( i agree completely )) 

551.71 553.85 A: you know it's just it's just hard

557.21 559.06 A: mhm 

557.56 567.68 B: you know my mother talked to me but like i had material things and and money and catholic school and all that but that emotional love i didn't really have except from my grandmother

578.61 580.15 A: mhm that's nice 

579.05 589.53 B: and yeah i have a lot of old fashioned sentimental values you know and you yeah and you don't find people like that anymore i have so much love to give and no one like appreciates it 

580.23 582.21 A: that's a good thing 

582.70 584.15 A: those are good things 

589.27 591.41 A: well i'm sure you do i'm sure you're little girls do 

590.35 591.28 B: [laughter]
