322.65 324.11 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

323.60 332.00 A: [lipsmack] so [sigh] how 'bout how 'bout before i mean any g- if you're going back into time uh before you were born 

331.86 333.67 B: [noise] before i was born 

332.54 338.87 A: w- would you want to go back to say like the civil war days or the revolutionary war days 

338.91 341.30 B: [sigh] i wou- um 

341.50 349.68 B: [sigh] well i want to go back into the days where there were kings and monarchs and so on because 

349.61 361.69 B: i always thought that was really interesting and i want to see like [sigh] the buildings the you know establishments yeah i think f- like far [sigh] you know nicer than [laughter] what we have today and you know at a point like 

355.21 356.33 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

361.08 367.78 A: well that's true um would you would you want to be under a a monarchy rule 

367.89 369.96 A: would that be something that would be interesting 

367.98 368.91 B: (( oh )) 

368.95 377.87 B: that's not what i w- like not the rule itself but i think more or less the environment like [sigh] the the buildings and you know the ways 

372.09 373.11 A: okay 

377.70 386.86 B: th- like the streets were put out but like [sigh] i never really [mn] i wasn't a fan of like monarchy or [laughter] anything like that 

385.71 386.81 A: (( mhm )) 

386.93 388.85 B: but yeah 

388.81 390.20 A: oh interesting 

389.73 391.11 B: like sight seeing 

391.06 394.91 A: i don't know i i think i'd want to go back to 

394.90 402.60 A: [lipsmack] i don't know maybe the turn of the century [noise] you know i mean it's a whole [sigh] you know it's a whole different thing i mean there were [sigh] 

397.77 398.61 B: yeah 

402.57 404.32 A: you know there were still t- 

404.23 414.85 A: t- territories that were weren't states you know i mean [sigh] you know a lot of our states uh like arizona and new mexico alaska hawaii [sigh] 

407.34 408.28 B: right 

414.74 418.75 A: you know they were still [noise] just territories and just the [sigh] 

417.40 418.21 B: mm 

418.58 420.37 A: to see how 

420.18 424.18 A: how an area is divided up and and uh 

424.11 436.71 A: put into um uh a thing where it's under a a a rule of of the united states as a specific state [sigh] i think that would be kind of neat to see you know especially the west [sigh] uh 

434.74 438.08 B: right the the development and so on right 

437.01 443.58 A: yeah you know what it's undeveloped territory they [sigh] you know people that moved there they have this [sigh] 

439.62 440.70 B: mhm 

443.37 455.13 A: huge amount of space and there is lots of land lots of open space and [sigh] the chance to uh build and to claim your territory [sigh] i think that'd be really kind of neat [noise] um 

453.74 459.18 B: [sigh] uh actually i 'cause i'm a christian so 

457.87 459.74 A: uh-huh i am too 

459.30 471.75 B: right so like i guess in a way i'm not as faithful as i'd like to be [sigh] because i still have some you know questioning bu- but i would love to go back [sigh] to the times to see if there is 

470.09 470.65 A: (( [cough] )) 

471.62 476.21 B: like the parables in the bible truly happened and 

473.93 475.02 A: (( mhm )) 

476.52 487.88 A: well i i i i we the bible does tell us that and and i think i i believe it it it they [sigh] i mean parables are stories and jesus did tell stories 

476.61 477.74 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

481.10 481.99 B: right 

485.81 486.77 B: right 

487.47 488.39 B: right 

487.65 493.73 A: about things so not everything in the bible is actual fact it's a lot of them are stories 

491.33 494.17 B: mhm i mean like they're happening right 

493.76 499.46 A: but that that show you know that that i- illustrate a point that jesus wanted to make 

499.05 500.04 B: right 

499.67 509.34 A: um [sigh] i er yeah i mean can you imagine go back to to uh to the days of jesus uh walking the face of the earth that would be 

503.01 504.95 B: but seeing him 

506.69 507.64 B: mhm 

508.42 511.43 B: right that would be awesome actually because 

510.46 524.44 A: [cough] yeah well i would love that that would i mean we would be in a minority you know and people would scorn us and and people would not believe [sigh] you know that i mean not everybody believed jesus obviously 

512.42 513.55 B: yeah 

515.32 516.16 B: (( hm )) 

524.01 524.88 B: right 

524.45 531.88 A: but just to you know even just the foresight to say this this is the real person and and and he is 

531.19 532.04 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

531.73 540.62 A: you know he is the uh the savior of the world to come but [sigh] you know that's putting ourselves in the position of jesus which which we don't want to do [sigh] 

540.23 541.15 B: mhm 

540.48 546.77 A: that would be interesting uh how do you think that would be um [lipsmack] how do you think uh life would be like 

546.30 548.19 B: if i were to go back 

547.57 550.24 A: yeah go back two thousand years 

548.20 549.62 B: to the time [sigh] 

550.05 552.14 B: i think that 

552.42 562.49 B: it wouldn't well definitely it wouldn't be as abundant as life now and [sigh] w- like you said we would be the minority group and we would be striving to [sigh] 

556.24 557.43 A: mhm 

562.32 576.28 B: not only survive but to you know make friends and not [sigh] you know h- have people that are actually loyal friends to us because nowadays religion's like [sigh] you don't have to be the same religion to be good friends like 

575.66 578.53 A: that's true that's that's very true 

576.43 582.51 B: but back then it's very back then it was really different it made a big deal it's like 

581.74 589.30 A: uh-huh uh-huh well and even today in in the jewish religion you know the [sigh] the jewish people want uh 

589.31 599.89 A: jewish people to marry other jewish people [sigh] uh christian uh you know christians and jews are very difficult to to be marry within in a in a religiously 

591.19 592.36 B: right
