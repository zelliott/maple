23.94 32.73 A: right right right yeah i was i was thinking like most of the things that i could think of were like aren't really that like significant and the [noise] significant things 

32.84 35.13 A: i wouldn't really want to change you know what i mean 

35.67 38.02 A: it's like i've learned from those so 

37.90 45.18 B: m- right like even the miserable things you wind up learning from like i hated where i went to college and you know 

45.22 52.89 B: sometimes i think i would have liked to have gone somewhere else where i would have been happier but then again there were so many really important things that i learned from that so 

52.60 55.82 A: right yeah i know that yeah 

53.90 54.75 B: (( [sigh] )) 

55.27 60.21 B: several years of misery [laughter] were sort of [laughter] very formative for me 

57.87 58.82 A: right 

59.90 71.99 A: right right i know i- i've done i've done some stupid things and i've had some unfortunate things but like yeah i just feel like i've i've i've become better for that so [sigh] i don't know kind of a tough question 

72.20 73.29 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

72.93 77.74 B: yeah i can't even i don't know i'm sure there is yeah same thing i'm sure there's some little stupid things that

80.96 81.89 A: yeah 

81.04 82.46 B: (( i don't know ))

88.65 90.20 A: (( well i don't know )) 

91.26 94.13 B: [sigh] [sigh] are there any like little things that come to mind for you 

93.75 94.81 A: (( um n- )) 

97.28 100.43 A: honestly not so much um shoo 

103.75 104.71 A: uh 

105.13 117.90 A: i guess just i- in general i just ha- [laughter] just but uh i don't think it's like one event you know just like i i haven't been too good at holding on to like some friendship that's friendships i've had with like certain people 

117.33 118.28 B: mhm 

117.85 123.33 A: but i don't know i think that's more um an outgrowth in my personality than [sigh] 

123.63 134.53 A: and moving on than like something that is really wrong with [laughter] my life right now and so i i don't know i mean that's the only thing i could really think of and that's not like one s- significant [noise] event either that's just like 

135.08 139.01 A: [sigh] a sort of trend that i'm not too happy [noise] about i guess 

138.75 139.91 B: yeah 

139.29 140.49 A: but [sigh] 

141.75 143.26 A: (( i don't know [sigh] )) 

144.55 146.40 B: yeah i'm trying to think of one 

147.07 151.87 B: [laughter] [sigh] normally you know like at three in the morning when you can't think you think of a lot of stuff you'd like to change 

151.44 153.57 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah 

152.06 153.23 B: [laughter] 

153.53 155.18 B: why did i do that 

154.59 156.25 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

157.04 158.92 A: (( yeah i know what you mean )) 

159.32 160.22 A: um 

163.54 168.32 B: yeah i guess another view that things happen for a reason and that don't work out the way they're supposed to 

167.59 172.23 A: wow yeah that's pretty much the way i i live my life so um 

174.37 177.78 A: i don't know and like i said like even like those those 

178.84 189.40 A: friends i may have lost or whatever like i've made new friends and you know what i mean like kind of i don't know [laughter] i tend to move on t- uh move on to new things pretty easily 

190.02 192.23 A: and i'm pretty content so [sigh] 

193.46 194.72 B: yeah 

196.21 205.86 A: hm i thought i thought it was actually going to be something different like time travel like i don't know but i i didn't know it was going to be like [sigh] your own life [laughter] but 

205.55 208.06 B: yeah that is a it is an interesting 

209.00 214.07 B: yeah that they're that they're focussing on that that it's not like oh what period of time would you like to go 

212.86 218.92 A: right right that would that would be an easier question anyway but 

214.45 216.43 B: [sigh] to go and live in 

218.60 222.86 B: yeah i don't even know how [laughter] how to answer that one i'm pretty 

223.38 226.59 B: i can't really imagine wanting to live in a different era 

226.55 227.59 A: right 

227.06 228.37 B: than this one 

228.21 228.92 A: (( right yeah )) 

233.01 233.82 A: (( i don't know [cough] )) 

233.70 238.19 B: or if you could time travel and go forward like would you go forward and see how your life turned out 

237.81 243.70 A: right right or if you could change like one like tremendous thing in history like you know 

240.16 241.16 B: right 

244.09 248.60 A: but i don't know i'm just yeah i kind of feel that everything happens for a reason 

249.72 255.45 A: you know if you change one thing you know it could [noise] it could have like drastic effects on everything else so mm mm 

255.24 262.01 B: right right like the one thing that i think comes to mind would have been like choosing to go somewhere else to college or transferring somewhere 

262.03 267.53 B: you know once i got there which actually you know i thought about doing but i really feel like that [noise] 

267.87 278.51 B: that was so influential on my career decisions on further educational decisions that [noise] you know it's like you know one of the really close friends that i've kept since then 

278.72 283.31 B: you know that if i'd left or if i hadn't gone there she and i wouldn't still be you know we wouldn't have met 

282.98 284.43 A: right right 

283.78 284.81 B: so 

287.46 290.29 A: (( yeah [noise] [cough] i hear you [laughter] ))

386.01 393.81 A: i have a lot of opinions about education i think i might want to teach so we had [laughter] like no problem like talking about like about problems in education but 

393.10 400.70 B: [sigh] [sigh] oh see that would have been perfect for me i'm getting a doctorate in it in higher education so see i could have i could have talked about that like forever but 

396.62 398.45 A: oh really yeah

427.58 429.69 A: um [mn] i don't know 

430.05 430.97 A: (( [noise] ))

431.09 431.84 B: yeah 

436.58 441.46 B: [sigh] yeah i don't know it's definitely an interesting topic and probably like 

441.53 443.64 B: there is definitely people who would 

443.80 444.65 A: yeah 

443.93 449.31 B: who would yes absolutely they can compl- this is the point in my life where everything went wrong [laughter] 

448.68 461.26 A: right right right that's sounds like how i feel maybe i'm i mean i don't know i i i'm happy with most decisions that i've made maybe i'm too young and maybe i'll [laughter] end up regretting some things but i i've sort of come to not regret most of the decisions i make although 

461.13 465.08 A: i know that they're either difficult for me or other people or 

464.56 465.87 B: right 

466.18 467.46 B: well how old are you

468.76 474.57 B: [sigh] see i'm ten years older and i'm still not like like right now i'm still not like really regretting very much 

471.27 472.16 A: yeah 

473.82 476.60 A: right no that makes sense i i hope to be at that at 

475.71 477.43 B: [laughter] 

476.77 478.23 A: that point [laughter] 

477.44 484.09 B: so see you don't have to become j- i mean i am a little jaded and bitter about some stuff [laughter] [laughter] but not about that [laughter] 

480.92 483.21 A: [laughter] yeah 

483.39 491.55 A: yeah no i try not to be maybe i i feel like i'm too [sigh] [laughter] carefree about some decisions i make but i don't know 

491.52 506.25 B: oh i obsess about everything but at least i feel pretty like happy [laughter] about it you know i obsess about it until i make the decision and then [sigh] you know i usually obsess about it afterwards but even looking back you know long range on everything that i've [sigh] that i've done so far 

495.26 497.79 A: yeah no i obsess with it yeah that 

502.70 503.46 A: [mn] 

505.90 506.98 A: right

509.43 511.27 A: [laughter] [sigh] yeah 

510.71 522.18 B: again growing experience like you know the relationship i'm in now i feel [laughter] i went through all those for a reason so that when the right person came along i'd be like hey you are a good guy 

512.23 513.65 A: right exactly 

521.53 523.65 A: (( yeah yeah yeah i know i )) 

521.99 527.08 B: [laughter] [laughter] i've been through enough crap to recognize [laughter] that you are a good guy 

526.52 535.47 A: yeah i definitely hear you on that one and the same thing with um with wi- i i really didn't like penn for a while but um it's definitely grown on me and i'm

549.93 552.27 A: yeah i just think i don't know i just think a lot of 

552.32 555.62 A: situations and i've had like so many like 

555.79 562.41 A: [noise] like different things go on and since i've been in school but like they've also like shaped me in different ways so 

561.44 562.49 B: mhm

570.07 570.99 B: mhm 

582.83 591.16 A: he is indulgent at some point so i don't know i like to live my life like that in some ways [sigh] but so that's why i try not to have any regrets
