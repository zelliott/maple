50.50 51.39 B: uh-huh 

58.29 64.50 A: um i think i'll start that way and get some just so i can just get some frames and paper and ink and things and um 

61.60 62.63 B: (( [noise] [noise] mmm )) 

63.40 65.57 B: so you're you're real creative

67.56 70.05 B: oh that's good 

69.32 72.16 A: s- have you ever given any thought to opening a business or 

70.81 84.51 B: [noise] a- actually mine would be a restaurant yeah because i have a brother who is um like a really good chef and we've always talked about opening up our own restaurant and so that that would be the only problem obviously would be to get up start up money and that would be [mn] 

73.34 74.66 A: oh cool 

79.45 80.72 A: oh cool 

83.97 91.38 A: right i i've actually done some checking on that too and there there are several you know different places that give grants for starting up a business 

90.63 93.90 B: uh-huh yeah i know i'm i'm researching that actually myself and he's 

93.26 94.47 A: mhm 

93.79 96.70 B: he right now he um pretty much everything he does he does 

96.59 110.42 B: on his own so he's going to um a culinary school at this moment just so he can get his credentials so he could say you know he's got credentials but he really doesn't need the training he already knows it and then me myself i'm a pretty savvy business person even though i'm 

102.00 103.18 A: cool 

110.73 117.46 B: you know i don't have any um business right now but i know that if i was able to start my own business i know i'd be successful 

113.59 114.55 A: mhm 

117.46 123.11 A: uh you sound like you sure would huh that's the impor- i think that's the important thing is doing all the research first and 

119.15 121.77 B: [laughter] 

121.88 125.92 B: y- y- y- yeah oh yeah definitely you have to do the research yeah 

125.09 129.53 A: getting your business plan and everything put together and 

126.29 127.16 B: uh-huh 

128.09 131.29 B: [mn] yeah so what kind of crafts like what do you like what do you do what kinda 

130.43 140.07 A: oh pretty much um any kind of like wall decor um i decorate baskets i've started a little bit on different kinds of um like total painting or decorative painting 

139.53 140.79 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

140.06 144.46 A: um i haven't gotten much into that but i think i'd really like to go down that avenue more 

144.44 157.14 A: um and i i kinda wanna do some things like maybe some graphic designs and um and a friend of mine started a business where she you know does like personalized labels and all kinds of things that you know you can start with your printer which 

148.32 149.31 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

157.02 162.74 A: to me that seemed like a cheap way to get started with it and i could even go to auction sites with things like that 

158.47 159.82 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

161.90 167.32 B: yeah god there's so there's there's so many options now available with the internet and people just 

162.78 163.80 A: and star- 

166.33 167.91 A: oh there is and i mean 

167.37 174.00 B: but but do you do you trust i mean are you you're not a little bit leery about selling over the internet i mean as far as 

172.67 173.49 A: you know 

173.34 182.93 A: i've started um basically what i did when i realized i wanna start a business i started getting into e. groups and you know different um groups of people that are already doing it 

177.59 178.46 B: uh-huh 

182.49 183.62 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

182.73 190.80 A: so i could feel more comfortable about learning from you know kinda like through their mistakes and through their um trial and error with things 

190.62 201.36 A: and [mn] you know i've really learned a lot that way and i'm getting some good business contacts and friends built friendships built through that where i can learn a lot and you know they can really help me along the way so 

192.87 193.76 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

201.28 208.23 A: it's making me feel a lot more comfortable about it because i can start off you know without going through some of the beginning mistakes that way 

205.68 206.59 B: (( mhm )) 

207.68 213.28 B: yeah uh-huh but i mean as far as people you know paying you and and sending things out and things and [noise] 

211.25 212.18 A: well 

212.48 219.86 A: yeah i think that is an issue you know that kind of is in the back of everyone's mind but the more people do it the more they're feeling at ease about it 

219.24 220.09 B: uh-huh 

219.63 230.87 A: and i know like at first i was a little leery about it but a lot of the um companies now the credit card companies y- have the protection on that sort of thing so it's not quite as big of an issue now i think 

226.78 228.25 B: yeah uh-huh 

230.06 233.57 B: yeah that's true and there's also this thing called like have you ever heard of pay pal 

233.35 236.08 A: oh yeah i i've used it many times [laughter] 

233.94 239.28 B: yeah th- yeah that that seems to be pretty legitimate and i use it too so 

238.66 242.91 A: i i'm hoping that more online businesses will start accepting that as a form of payment 

241.78 247.85 B: yeah that's true i i actually would rather do that than give someone my my credit card you know 'cause 

243.27 244.32 A: 'cause it 

245.77 249.04 A: absolutely i feel a lot safer that way 

248.00 253.12 B: i actually had my credit card um um used um from online before so 

251.41 252.19 A: (( ooh )) 

253.16 254.51 A: that's scary 

253.77 263.21 B: yeah luckily it was just a credit card and then the company just you know didn't even charge me for it they just did research and then they gave me the credit but [sigh] yeah that's the scary thing that you have to be careful with 

260.53 261.80 A: good 

262.94 264.20 A: exactly 

263.67 264.59 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

265.09 270.77 A: i actually i put i had a de- i had a deb- i got a debit card through pay pal and i use that online 

268.75 269.61 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

270.27 274.92 B: oh yeah i didn't know you could that i'll have to look into that yeah that's pretty good [noise] 

271.06 271.88 A: so 

272.06 280.25 A: mhm yep so that way you don't even have to use your credit card and you don't you feel i feel way safer using that than i would anything so 

278.37 279.23 B: uh-huh 

279.26 282.20 B: [noise] yeah that's true yeah [noise] [noise] 

280.91 295.43 A: and also pay pal you might wanna check they have a [lipsmack] a thing where you it's an online kinda like an online credit card number that you use and it's not an actual credit card all it does it does is debit funds from your pay pal account and you don't even have to have an actual card for that one 

287.35 288.23 B: uh-huh 

292.11 293.03 B: uh-huh 

295.16 296.29 B: (( mm )) 

295.90 299.90 A: and the number changes each time so it's not like someone could even steal it 

299.54 301.72 B: oh that's a good idea 

300.49 307.85 A: so you could even i think if you click on like their shops icon and then you can there's a icon off to the side about it where you can 

303.34 304.22 B: uh-huh 

307.30 308.08 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

307.96 313.94 A: i forget exactly what it's called but it's something like online debit or something like that yes 

311.85 316.44 B: i'll have to look into that [noise] so how how close are you to to your to starting your business [noise] 

315.96 330.92 A: well um actually i just applied for um an e._i._n. number you know through the um for taxes mhm so the i i got that step underway and right now i'm researching different possibilities about a website and what would be the cheapest route to go with that

332.91 340.66 A: um i've done some small ones but nothing major yet so i'm trying to decide if be bet- if it be better to do my own or hire someone else to do it 

334.96 336.64 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh [noise] )) 

339.91 341.51 B: oh

354.34 358.27 B: [laughter] [laughter] i don't know if you're allowed to get that but if you want to

569.97 570.67 A: hm 

570.45 573.08 B: just about it might be about a couple of minutes 

572.64 573.86 A: yeah 

573.16 577.14 B: [noise] that's so what else what else could we talk about [laughter] 

576.57 583.32 A: uh let me think i'm trying to think if there's any obstacles i've run into or anything i've learned especially um 

580.17 582.03 B: (( yeah )) 

582.39 583.41 B: [noise] 

583.75 595.28 A: one good thing i learned is you don't have to have a merchant account to um for a website you can actually go through pay pal and they have all the tools to put a shopping cart on your site and everything like that which is very good 

586.53 587.45 B: uh-huh 

592.50 593.69 B: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

595.29 598.70 A: 'cause a merchant account can cost a lotta money to get one going 

597.61 599.89 B: [noise] oh really 

599.42 599.89 A: right
