19.89 21.25 B: yeah 

20.74 21.85 A: let's see 

21.94 26.63 A: i have actually quite a few [laughter] that i would change how 'bout you go first 

23.71 24.82 B: [laughter] 

26.28 27.46 B: um 

27.91 32.79 B: (( god what would i ch- i don't even know th- things have worked out all right )) 

33.22 34.54 B: um [laughter] 

37.91 42.09 B: i think that i may have 

42.65 45.23 B: (( made mys- gosh i don't know )) 

45.43 49.06 B: maybe my uh maybe i would have tried to focus a little more in school 

49.02 49.88 A: (( [laughter] okay )) 

50.49 53.70 A: that makes sense everybody has that one that was [sigh] you know 

52.26 54.62 B: yeah i kind of chickened out 

54.08 60.73 A: when y- when you get older you know how important education is instead of when you're younger thinking ah it's boring [laughter] 

60.79 73.55 A: i think i would have gone to uh [lipsmack] a college i was um offered a couple different scholarships in a couple different colleges [sigh] and at the time my family was going through a divorce and so things were really crazy and i didn't go to either one 

73.20 74.35 B: (( [cough] oh )) 

73.64 75.79 A: and that is something i do regret 

75.76 77.22 B: (( okay and )) 

76.55 79.60 A: so i would no matter what go to at least one of them [lipsmack] 

80.54 81.56 A: but that's 

82.04 84.26 B: have and you have not gone back 

83.65 88.91 A: [sigh] um i went to uh business college for a little while for like a year got a 

86.96 87.78 B: (( okay )) 

89.43 93.82 A: a little thing but nothing like what i had hopes and plans for [lipsmack] 

93.22 94.86 B: right 

94.65 103.08 A: yeah i got married early instead you know the whole escape the whole [laughter] bad home [laughter] life kind of thing and [lipsmack] 

98.82 99.76 B: sure 

103.24 109.76 A: never went back for either way i had intended but i mean my life is good now it's not bad it's just it 

108.13 109.13 B: yeah 

110.87 116.83 A: might have been a little more financially good you know [laughter] but that's 

113.14 114.29 B: [laughter] 

115.07 116.98 B: (( um )) 

117.13 122.44 B: i'm trying to think of anything else i think that i was um a soccer player 

122.58 123.80 A: oh there you go 

123.69 125.92 B: and i think that i when i was younger 

126.22 129.57 B: i was lucky in the sense that i was just a lot faster 

129.63 141.22 B: i was always pretty fast [noise] and i could just run by the other guys [noise] and i think because of that i didn't i don't think i focussed as much on the other skills that would have made me like a more complete player 

133.33 134.42 A: wow 

141.12 142.81 A: oh yeah 

142.10 145.74 B: and i think [noise] i mean like i went and played in college and all that 

145.89 148.31 B: but i feel like had i 

149.79 157.29 B: i focussed a little [noise] bit more there i may have been able to be maybe to maybe able to go further with it beyond college 

157.60 159.67 A: oh you were that fast 

159.80 162.06 B: [lipsmack] well oh yeah 

161.51 163.46 A: or you could have been if you focused 

163.21 166.36 B: well i think i could have just been a better overall player 

166.91 168.93 B: (( could have been a more well rounded player )) 

168.88 171.43 A: hm do you do anything with sports now or 

171.03 172.69 B: i still play yeah 

171.99 172.98 A: (( do ya )) 

173.07 176.05 A: just like with your friends on a weekend kind of thing or 

175.23 177.61 B: uh yeah i have a couple different teams in uh 

177.80 178.50 A: (( mm )) 

179.31 180.59 A: [noise] 

179.36 182.42 B: but there's there's a couple of local leagues there's a lot of uh 

182.70 184.87 B: like international players around here 

184.80 185.76 A: (( oh )) 

185.45 187.70 B: um i'm outside of washington 

187.62 188.82 A: oh okay 

188.45 189.75 B: and uh 

190.23 193.27 B: so yeah how about yourself 

193.79 202.03 A: uh i wasn't a real sport yeah actually though basketball [laughter] i loved basketball in school but [sigh] when i was there that was uh 

197.19 198.12 B: okay 

201.79 209.14 A: a while ago [sigh] and um [laughter] they didn't really push girls they didn't have a girls basketball team they didn't have anything like that so 

209.29 211.24 A: it was more or less uh 

211.36 217.10 A: oh good you play it here maybe with your friends and that was about it it wasn't encouraged at all 

213.25 214.06 B: right 

217.49 218.49 B: my 

217.54 220.92 A: and my mother was a very womanly woman so there was 

220.26 221.01 B: (( oh )) 

221.01 225.10 A: no encouragement in that end and [laughter] [sigh] but 

224.48 226.07 B: my mom used to play 

226.18 234.49 B: basketball in high school and again when it wasn't really all that well encouraged and it used to be half court i believe 

231.26 232.17 A: uh-huh 

234.29 235.47 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

236.07 240.79 B: i think that some of the players were only allowed to stay on one side of the court and other players were not you 

239.23 242.96 A: uh-huh oh yah it was it was definitely not 

243.73 244.88 A: um

247.19 247.86 B: (( know )) 

251.58 256.09 A: [sigh] but you know it just wasn't en- definitely for girls it definitely wasn't um 

256.47 257.68 A: a big deal 

258.34 262.40 A: unless you were like going for the olympics i don't even think they had olympic basketball team back then 

262.63 263.92 B: (( i don't know )) 

263.42 268.43 A: i don't know [laughter] but that that's a sport that i liked and playing the drums

266.29 267.00 B: right 

268.55 269.89 B: oh wow okay 

268.93 273.00 A: i wish i would have kept playing the drums and actually learned to really play them well 

272.79 273.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

274.02 275.40 A: that's something i [sigh] [lipsmack] 

275.13 282.90 B: yeah you know i could add that as well i've always wanted to play guitar and on a c- on two different occasions i started taking lessons and i just put it down 

283.49 284.46 A: why 

283.78 290.83 B: and i wish i had of learned i don't know i just it was expensive and my mom was paying for it and i didn't want her to have to 

288.71 289.90 A: oh 

290.98 292.14 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

291.28 292.50 B: (( and you )) 

293.01 298.95 B: know i thought i i thought it maybe was just a fad and i wasn't really that interested in it but i've always been 

299.14 301.75 A: well you know they have those those things now 

301.77 309.19 A: you could rent a video or buy a video and learn the guitar in a weekend or whatever [laughter] they have those things [laughter]

309.94 311.87 A: yeah there you go [laughter] 

311.11 314.79 B: which embarrassingly enough i've bought and oh [laughter]

315.64 317.09 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

316.38 318.10 A: you know [laughter] 

318.13 327.92 A: you see when you're done reading them you're not a dummy any more so you give them to someone else you see that's you you go what is it the idiots is the next right or it's idiots and then dummies or yeah 

320.61 322.35 B: well that that's true 

324.77 325.61 B: yeah

344.51 345.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

345.21 351.32 B: but it would have been nice had i come and i think and i think you think the same way 

351.58 354.97 B: this falls into a little bit of what you described about college 

355.22 357.33 B: is that i wished i was in a position 

357.49 363.21 B: after school or even before school where money wasn't as much of an object 

362.75 364.12 A: [sigh] right 

363.85 366.72 B: and i wish that i could've travelled more 

366.39 371.47 A: mm oh oh dah i forgot about the yeah that's that's yeah mhm 

369.24 370.05 B: uh-huh

376.72 378.30 A: oh that's wonderful 

376.90 388.21 B: and i've been very lucky in that regard but [noise] i wish i could've done more and gotten around [noise] a little bit more especially now that the world's a different place and since i was able to do that travelling 

390.24 395.84 B: meaning that i meaning that my trip most of my trips were before september eleventh two thousand and one 

390.46 391.80 A: sorry i'm just

398.84 410.36 B: well no i guess i do have opportunities now but [noise] it would have been nice if i could've maybe you know taken a year or two off during college and gone and seen a lot of different parts of africa and asia 

406.33 407.34 A: oh 

409.80 411.37 A: that's my big yeah
