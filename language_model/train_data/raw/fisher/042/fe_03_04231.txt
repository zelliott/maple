7.28 10.42 B: i am calling from farmington hills michigan 

10.29 14.96 A: awesome i'm in clarksville tennessee we're far away 

12.96 14.25 B: (( wow yep )) 

14.52 15.86 B: (( [laughter] )) 

16.01 18.08 A: are you on a cellular phone 

17.85 19.87 B: (( no i'm on the calling list )) 

19.26 20.53 A: sweet 

20.28 21.43 B: yeah 

20.81 24.36 A: 'cause it always asks you if you're on it and i'm like no 

23.92 25.51 B: [laughter] 

24.89 26.48 A: i'm on a regular phone 

26.51 28.39 B: (( yeah have you done this before )) 

27.83 35.85 A: [sigh] yeah over the past they it calls me like every day for the past like three days and this is the third time i've done it so hopefully this will be last 

35.12 37.39 B: yes this is the third time for me too 

37.48 39.05 A: awesome 

38.44 40.16 B: hopefully i'll get my money 

40.34 43.30 A: thirty whole dollars big money 

41.48 42.79 B: [laughter] 

43.59 45.65 B: yep yeah right 

44.33 48.02 A: [sigh] what what do you think about time travel 

46.56 48.42 B: (( um i )) 

49.04 50.96 B: i mean 

51.07 59.58 B: oh [laughter] it sounds cool to me i have i have some problems with it i don't think it's like possible because if there was then there'd be time travelers around right now 

60.34 63.32 A: they'd be like coming in back and being like hey guys 

62.70 63.99 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

63.34 64.69 A: what's up [sigh] 

64.08 76.38 B: yeah i would think that you know like write articles where it's like if if time travel was ever invented then that would be like the end of the time because it would have no meaning 'cause you can just go back and forth and stuff 

76.74 81.12 B: you know like technology would be brought to the past and stuff like that i 

82.22 83.84 B: (( don't know mhm mhm right [laughter] )) 

83.26 92.00 A: yeah i don't know too much about the basics of it but i think it might be possible to go forward 

93.20 100.42 A: but i don't think it'd be possible to go backwards because you would probably lose your age 

100.70 106.83 A: like 'cause if you actually did go back then i i have no idea 'cause there's too many i'm not too 

107.21 110.52 A: i don't research it or anything but it sounds cool but 

110.82 115.89 A: there probably is a way to go forward but you'd probably age too so 

115.26 116.31 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

115.98 121.41 A: it wouldn't be as cool as like the movies like hey eighteen miles per hour you know 

121.02 129.65 B: [laughter] yeah i don't [laughter] i don't see how you couldn't age either i guess i don't know it's kind of a silly thing [laughter] to even ponder about i think 

129.10 130.44 A: for real 

129.98 131.68 B: yeah 

131.11 140.19 A: is is there a like 'cause it you know i thought it was going to be all cool and it was like hypothetical situation time travel so i figure we just get to talk about it but and then it's like 

139.97 141.16 B: yeah 

140.56 142.87 A: there's one situation 

143.27 151.86 A: like you would go back in time and change would would you ever do anything like that is there like something that you would totally like to change 

150.29 159.38 B: if i could go back in time i really i really have no regrets in my life if there was like a historical event 

159.82 163.12 B: i don't know it'd be pretty weird because i guess i 

163.60 167.74 B: don't know maybe like the holocaust or something that that could be stopped but 

168.60 173.24 B: i don't know other than that i can't i mean there's tragedies that happen but it also like 

173.44 179.04 B: cuts back the population [laughter] you know like great like diseases and stuff like that i i 

179.09 181.93 B: don't know if it'd be worth fixing or not mhm 

179.11 179.96 A: mhm 

182.40 196.95 A: 'cause it's history uh yeah i think it was i guess this is asking it on a more personal level i mean i'm twenty years old and i don't think i've done any big decisions that like have ruined my life or anything like that especially at this point in time 

196.54 197.69 B: yeah 

197.11 209.52 A: and the only thing like that probably i'd be like man i wish when i was in high school i asked this girl out or something something of that it wouldn't be a big thing but i i couldn't think of anything serious that would actually 

202.59 203.72 B: really 

205.51 206.53 B: mhm 

209.66 219.82 A: change anything considerably 'cause like i said i mean i'm twenty years old i i also i don't really have that many regrets i i mean i i'm still growing up so 

219.76 228.48 B: yeah i i definitely stay away from regrets and the majority of the time i you know if i if i halfway want to do something i just go ahead and do it 

228.19 229.62 A: hell yeah dude 

228.74 230.92 B: (( and see what happens [laughter] you know )) 

230.66 232.53 A: it's the way you gotta do it 

231.91 232.89 B: (( yeah so )) 

233.39 234.28 A: (( how how )) 

233.51 236.39 B: (( i don't know i i really don't have any regrets at all )) 

236.87 238.46 A: how old are you man 

237.90 239.17 B: i'm eighteen 

239.03 243.12 A: awesome are you like just graduating high school 

242.03 244.57 B: i i graduate in nine days 

244.16 245.89 A: that's camping dude 

245.38 246.70 B: (( [laughter] yeah it is )) 

246.49 248.30 A: it's a great time 

247.67 249.41 B: yeah it's a lot of fun 

249.46 252.80 B: [noise] got got the prom coming up and all that 

250.12 251.59 A: high high school 

253.07 255.84 A: hell yeah dude good times 

255.16 257.15 B: (( there's good [laughter] times )) 

257.89 260.37 A: [noise] are you going to go to college or something 

259.74 265.05 B: yeah uh community college probably are you going to college right now 

264.67 268.78 A: yeah i'm going to sun state college it it's terrible i hate college 

268.16 269.35 B: really 

268.81 270.24 A: maybe you'll hate it too 

270.05 271.28 B: [laughter] 

271.91 273.46 B: (( why do you hate it )) 

272.95 285.27 A: uh just i don't take it seriously so i don't do any of the work maybe i could time travel and like but i just have this mindset that i just want to hang out and chill for right now i don't really want to 

279.25 280.38 B: [laughter] 

285.59 288.27 B: yeah you're spending all that money though for tuition 

287.85 292.41 A: exact yeah i'm not going to go back unless i take it seriously i decided that 

291.24 293.72 B: oh you're not going to college then huh it's 

293.56 296.20 A: i i i went for two years but 

296.41 302.72 A: after this semester i did horribly and then i gotta time travel no i'm gonna 

296.73 297.35 B: (( not )) 

301.50 303.13 B: [laughter] 

302.51 313.38 A: i i'm not gonna go back unless i'm gonna take it like give it my all and i'm i said that before but i'm not going to waste my money because it is a ton of money to go to college [sigh] 

312.10 321.64 B: yeah yeah i think actually it it would be cool to control time in in [laughter] matters such as that like if you've got a lot of homework to do you can just like slow everything down 

321.94 323.07 B: and do it 

322.85 328.15 A: then you're like and then you can get all the big scholarships that all the kids get and you're like yeah 

327.52 331.65 B: yeah [laughter] and you could speed up through crap you don't want to sit through 

331.72 332.28 A: (( [sigh] )) 

332.58 335.32 B: (( pretty cool i would like i'd like that [mn] )) 

334.32 345.76 A: yeah to not have to pay for college would've been grand 'cause [sigh] still i guess that might be one of those things that if i could go back but i probably would do the same thing again i'd probably just go out and hang out and party and 

338.39 339.28 B: (( right )) 

347.11 349.69 A: [sigh] not do my work again so 

349.42 352.79 B: yeah [laughter] what were you what were you going to major in 

352.90 356.20 A: (( i have man i don't have any idea [mn] )) 

355.40 356.71 B: [laughter] 

356.08 370.98 A: maybe computer science i was thinking that but the past two years all i've taken is basically core classes and i took like a social work class and a broadcasting class and just all these random like things that i might be interested in but i have no idea 

370.33 371.29 B: (( uh-huh )) 

370.95 373.51 A: i want to be a fireman seriously 

372.31 373.21 B: (( oh yeah oh ))

388.23 389.41 B: (( i don't know )) 

390.40 394.27 B: (( yeah i i was thinking about taking a computer science degree actually a )) 

395.06 399.09 A: yeah it might be cool but it i don't know 

399.02 400.59 B: (( lot of work [laughter] )) 

399.98 403.72 A: yeah probably programming and stuff i don't want to do any of that 

403.03 408.67 B: oh yeah no i my brother's got a got a computer science degree he doesn't do crap like that really 

408.43 410.52 A: i'd rather just do networking and

421.24 423.85 B: (( you know especially community college )) 

424.23 429.93 B: i don't know i wouldn't mind time traveling [laughter] to the future where i got a job already 

424.73 425.38 A: (( [mn] )) 

430.50 431.73 B: (( that'd be cool ))

436.00 436.85 A: (( college )) 

437.49 439.64 B: lot of fun doing stuff 

440.53 443.97 B: if i could time travel through the crap i don't want to do every day i 

443.99 446.34 B: wonder how short my day would be then though 

445.93 447.48 A: [laughter] 

447.47 448.86 B: (( probably be quick )) 

449.89 453.57 A: let's talk about time traveling to the future 

452.89 453.95 B: [laughter] 

454.29 458.07 A: like i i have no idea that would be i guess that would be cool 

457.79 459.00 B: yeah 

458.55 461.67 A: but i can't really say much about it 'cause who knows 

461.93 465.89 B: i don't know you i don't know what do you think the future is going to be like 

465.99 468.19 A: (( uh )) 

467.55 470.87 B: (( let's say like twenty years down the road yeah )) 

470.49 476.66 A: man i see that's like my whole lifetime it's so crazy thinking about that 'cause 

473.55 474.66 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

476.88 482.13 A: in twenty years the everything it hasn't changed that much but it has 

482.62 489.30 A: like i don't know i guess computers have become a lot more part of people's lives and running a lot of things and i 

489.44 497.45 A: i don't know if that will continue i'm pretty sure it will like i don't i'm sure everything won't become computerized and the computers won't take over the world or anything but 

497.58 499.42 A: it just looks like 

499.89 512.79 A: everything's going to be a little more techie and like a lot of skills like computer skills will probably be pretty much standard 'cause kids growing up are probably just going to start killing it like playing on the computers like 

512.17 513.28 B: [noise] 

513.04 516.93 A: using unix and compiling kernels and crap 

516.10 517.07 B: (( mhm [noise] yeah uh-huh )) 

517.25 524.56 A: it's going to be nuts and they're just going to all the like kids like will be like four years old and they'll be like hey and they'll be like fifteen they'll be like nah nah 

524.65 530.15 A: nah nah nah nah like just rock i mean seriously they're going to rock in they're going to know everything and they're so young

531.01 533.58 A: (( and they're just going to own it ))

536.71 538.46 A: man that is horrid 

538.47 539.27 B: oh 

538.58 543.09 A: see that's uh man that's like a really tough question right there 

542.68 543.85 B: [laughter] 

543.23 548.48 A: a hundred years in the future what do you think man what's what's your views on this 

548.03 551.62 B: (( i don't know [laughter] i i'm asking the questions here )) 

548.96 550.35 A: [laughter] 

551.62 553.66 A: a hundred years from now 

552.99 558.40 B: oh i just did this project and it said we're going to run out of fresh water in fifty years [laughter] 

558.90 562.76 B: it's like yeah like a lot of places are going to run out of fresh water 

558.98 560.22 A: really

571.48 575.37 B: (( tap tap the well i don't know i )) 

575.63 576.65 B: (( don't )) 

578.33 583.52 B: really twenty years [laughter] down the road lot of lot of bad stuff in the environment i suppose 

583.56 588.45 A: yeah we're probably going to destroy the world pretty quickly we got gasoline we 

588.28 591.01 B: yeah yeah we're running out of resources and stuff 

590.47 593.48 A: too much consumption equals genocide 

593.48 594.68 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

594.27 595.51 A: i don't know 

595.64 596.85 B: (( yeah ))
