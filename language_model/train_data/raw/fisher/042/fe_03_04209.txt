114.20 115.30 B: wow 

115.14 116.31 A: (( yeah i know )) 

116.30 119.96 B: i would love that i mean the opportunity to not work 

117.34 118.15 A: [laughter] 

120.02 129.74 B: or like you know and have to go into an office kind of thing and just work at home for three or four hours [sigh] and he's making a good living at it okay that sounds like a pretty good business 

125.48 126.39 A: right 

129.17 139.62 A: i know [laughter] i know it sounds terrific um i guess actually also by working in the restaurant industry for so long i always thought you know being able to open up a restaurant would be great too 

130.00 131.13 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

139.72 144.50 A: but [mn] you know what screw screw that [laughter] 

142.99 145.37 B: [laughter] it's really a hard business i hear 

145.22 159.28 A: it is sort of it is a hard business but you know there's so many people that fail at it just because of their own [mn] their own idiosyncrasies uh um mo- the majority of the people that i've worked for uh uh they uh 

159.22 167.71 A: they just add on their own ideas of what should be in the restaurant as opposed to paying attention to the to the people that come in 

167.65 168.80 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

167.91 170.92 A: uh anyway it's a 

170.14 171.72 B: mm that's hard 

171.19 176.59 A: [mn] yeah i don't i'm not i'm not actually happy with either one of the poi- things i just said [laughter] 

175.49 176.65 B: (( what do you do all ))

192.66 195.06 B: yeah i was thinking about brooklyn 

193.25 194.56 A: excellent 

195.49 198.16 B: but anyway so tell me more about your business 

195.56 196.43 A: well 

198.10 210.50 A: oh um [cough] [lipsmack] actually i'm not even sure uh both those like i said both those sugges- those uh those thoughts the restaurant or the online thing didn't even sound all that appealing to me 

198.19 198.99 B: (( [laughter] )) 

209.97 210.76 B: mm 

210.59 214.86 A: i mean a as an actor i would much rather have uh [mn] 

215.40 224.80 A: like open up a company um which i've tried to do in the past but you know the uh the money always ended up being more of an issue than it needed it to be 

216.90 217.89 B: mhm 

224.45 230.99 B: yeah that seems like filament that people have about opening their own business costs a lot of money [sigh] takes a lot of time 

230.65 231.98 A: right 

231.37 233.32 B: but i like the online idea 

233.16 234.48 A: what is it you do 

234.13 238.52 B: [sigh] um i teach graphic design and web development 

237.94 239.17 A: oh okay 

238.64 240.11 B: yeah so 

239.24 253.90 A: oh that's right that's what in fact the last time i had a conversation in regards to what i would change if i could go back in time was uh i would i would uh pay more attention uh just after i took my uh second class in basic computer 

255.09 256.44 B: what what would you do 

256.14 260.69 A: i would have uh paid more attention uh i would have gotten into computers more 

257.91 259.79 B: oh yes 

260.62 275.28 B: yeah yeah you know i you know i'm bored with them myself though it's like any job do you want to you know you've done something enough that you're like okay i mean it sounds like it's stable money but i'm in web so it's not unless you have a business which is kind of um 

264.55 265.55 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

266.94 267.52 A: (( [cough] )) 

275.43 281.04 B: [lipsmack] that's what your friend does which makes money which is great [laughter] web design's pretty competitive right now 

278.23 279.13 A: right 

281.24 284.54 B: so i don't know what you know if i would recommend it to you 

282.75 283.31 A: (( [cough] )) 

284.35 291.19 A: right well it's just that it has more to do with just uh being able to make use of uh some of the easier programs [mn] 

291.63 294.78 A: which as time goes on i'm sure i'll start to do a little bit of 

294.66 299.72 B: well i teach it so if ever you want to take a class [laughter] you could always find me at berouk i teach there 

299.44 301.17 A: oh hot stuff 

300.61 306.95 B: [laughter] so that's what i do i'm i'm telling you about myself i found about this study um 

301.35 304.03 A: [laughter] 

307.07 313.04 B: [lipsmack] you know online on craig's list and i was all right i'll do it it sounded kind of fun [laughter] everyone knows about craig's list 

309.87 311.19 A: that's where i found it 

313.08 326.17 B: so um what am i supposed to talk about i'm supposed to talk about um i have to right i should talk about what they gave me a little bit okay um [lipsmack] so if i was going to change one thing that i could have changed um 

318.93 319.72 A: sure 

324.44 325.69 A: mhm 

326.43 333.80 B: maybe i would have majored in something in college [laughter] a little more a little more with something to fall back on because i was an art major 

333.92 340.11 B: which i loved but i don't think it gave me an entree into the professional world i had to struggle 

334.11 335.54 A: (( mm )) 

340.03 353.67 B: and i'm kind of still paying for that decision [laughter] so i could go back i'm an adjunct instructor so it's you know i again about the money you don't really have a steady income and you're running around to like five different colleges so um 

350.77 351.76 A: right 

353.55 360.44 B: [lipsmack] so that's i guess if i could back in time but nothing too dramatic if you could do that would you change anything 

360.30 361.24 A: huh 

361.26 365.36 A: i'm very similar my uh degree was uh theater and dance 

365.15 366.12 B: (( yeah )) 

365.60 370.20 A: [laughter] that's why i bartend so much [mn] 

366.88 369.34 B: [laughter] so yeah [laughter] 

370.20 375.83 B: yeah i look at people who were smart i mean a lot of my friends majored in business and got in on the 

376.05 378.29 B: you know they were very very um 

378.38 389.93 B: different than me they all want i wanted to follow my bliss and they wanted to make money um so [laughter] so i was like well i i'm going to make the money and i'll be happy well i'm happier with my choice but 

382.77 383.70 A: right 

383.80 384.48 A: (( [cough] )) 

389.83 395.11 B: um i know a lot of miserable people in business but damn they have money and cars and [laughter] houses 

394.74 395.77 A: right 

395.16 400.75 B: and they they sure got in on the stock market i've missed like two um upsurge markets or whatever 

400.33 401.74 A: exactly 

400.84 407.32 B: and i didn't play the market so you know i didn't buy oh and i didn't buy my own place that's the biggest dr- thing i think 

406.91 408.19 A: right 

407.39 411.41 B: these sound like regrets but i guess they're just different choices still 

410.50 417.66 A: no no that makes sense you know even when i i try when i tried to buy my own place i realized that i had tried a little bit too late 

417.24 418.41 B: yeah 

417.82 418.98 A: uh 

419.01 430.04 A: yeah and oh my god you know the st- stock market oh what an what an awful thing i [laughter] there was there were two points where i uh looked at uh my portfolio and i thought 

423.67 424.71 B: (( [laughter] )) 

430.84 442.72 A: [mn] perfect this is so set uh even if this starts to drop a little bit uh there's no way that i'm going to be losing any real money on this i've already made so much and uh 

441.06 441.97 B: wow 

442.85 452.06 A: and uh [laughter] and then all of a sudden the accounting scandals came out and [laughter] everything dropped much more than i ever thought it ever would 

450.33 453.40 B: did you have enron a lot in enron [laughter] 

452.68 459.74 A: um not enron but uh xerox uh was a major was a major one

473.78 478.93 B: and i i had been living there for twelve years but kind of through a sublet situation 

478.86 493.48 B: and it was rent controlled it was great and then i tried to buy it and i realized what i looked like on paper to a snooty co-op board and it wasn't good [laughter] and so you know your portfolio matters and i realized i didn't have one anyway so if you never had it you couldn't really lose it 

484.15 485.04 A: (( mhm )) 

485.54 486.78 A: no i know 

493.22 494.15 A: right
