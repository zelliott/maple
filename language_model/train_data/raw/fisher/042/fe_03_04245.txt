102.96 104.13 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

104.13 118.97 A: so i would say if i could time travel i might go back at least to my twenties [laughter] [sigh] and maybe try and meet my current husband back then [sigh] and kind of i 'cause i always dreamed of having a big family and you know 

110.08 111.21 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

118.79 119.95 B: yes 

119.57 123.33 A: life just doesn't turn out the way you expect sometimes 

122.84 126.10 B: [sigh] oh that's absolutely true 

125.87 135.84 A: this is true but i wouldn't trade my husband for the world so maybe i wouldn't change things but [sigh] um i also really i'm kind of an old fashioned person 

126.13 126.91 B: (( but )) 

135.57 136.47 B: (( uh-huh mm )) 

136.25 144.87 A: and i probably i think the era that my parents grew up in you know they were my age in the fifties [sigh] and um 

145.13 158.91 A: [lipsmack] i don't know i just think they had it all right back then having the big families and [sigh] the morals of the country seemed better and [sigh] you get married i don't know i just kind of like that whole era even though i've loved having my career 

158.95 160.33 A: and all that 

160.66 161.76 B: yes 

160.89 164.70 A: i kind of think the world was a much better place in the fifties [laughter] 

164.33 168.59 B: i think so everybody fought for their marriages and [mn] for the families back then 

166.91 167.92 A: yes 

168.46 172.31 A: this is true and now it just seems everyone's a little

173.97 176.29 B: (( [laughter] huh oh yes [sigh] [mn] )) 

175.66 181.41 A: don't know exactly what they want and i mean the career thing i'm glad i did it and i 

181.53 194.59 A: got a degree in radio news broadcasting and i was a reporter for a while and i did all those wonderful things [sigh] that now that now that i got married later in life i feel like i'm kind of like well

219.28 219.86 B: (( [sigh] ))

284.00 285.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

285.99 287.34 B: a problem but problem 

287.19 293.66 A: [noise] well i think i would i would definitely go back 'cause when i was about twenty three i met a guy

326.06 329.09 B: that's right [sigh] um so many regrets 

327.47 332.03 A: but i guess every i would think everybody would want to go back and change something 

332.70 336.37 B: oh yes i think that [sigh] i think that if i didn't 

337.12 341.64 B: if i may not have met my husband although i may not have met him
