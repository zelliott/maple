91.71 98.49 A: and and ah so but i was gonna go to college he never went to college and i said i'm gonna go to college and i'm gonna be a minister 

98.72 105.09 A: well i got into college and and it wasn't what i wanted to and because i'd gone to very small high school 

105.07 117.13 A: i ah i did not have the education that i found i needed when i went to college and i don't know if you have that problem in in in california but we do have that here in in iowa 

117.09 125.05 A: and we're still having it because our our population is so small i had no foreign language 

118.29 119.33 B: mhm 

125.25 135.91 A: and for being a minister i was required that at the college i was going to to be a minister to have both latin and german and i had neither one

144.99 145.96 B: mhm 

145.64 158.50 A: okay when you've come from a high school that doesn't have it and you they throw you in with four hundred kids in college and said you know this is beginning german and this is beginning latin 

158.48 160.18 A: um you know 

160.01 174.25 A: i i was just totally lost and i was i got very frustrated so i quit after the first semester and came home and and was drafted into the army which was probably the best thing that ever happened to me straightened kind of straightened me out and and [mn] 

171.52 173.71 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

174.17 179.65 A: made me realise that there is something outside of life other then 

179.74 181.41 A: ah you know 

181.85 183.94 A: just working out on the farm 

183.99 190.72 A: one of the things that ah that i did learn in the service is i i had never met a black person before 

190.37 191.49 B: mhm 

190.90 194.74 A: and the college that i was going to of course this was back in sixty two 

194.79 203.05 A: ah nineteen sixty two did not have colored people because we were isolated we were you know back then we're

240.38 245.75 A: had the same kind of problems that i did only he stuck it out and and he's now a teacher 

246.02 260.11 A: ah an educator but um i did not want to be an educator that i knew and ah but i did want to be a pastor so i i would definitely do that go back to college or go to college and get a degree 

260.06 267.37 A: and and have some kind of retirement i have no retirement right now i am retired i am a retired farmer 

267.40 271.55 A: but ah you know we don't put money away into ah

281.70 283.07 B: mhm 

285.05 286.36 B: yeah 

285.78 290.58 A: and um so that's that's the one thing i definitely would change

345.19 346.29 B: mhm 

346.00 350.81 A: ah you know [mn] that's the way most farmers are un- unless you get 

350.69 364.14 A: ah large into livestock and th- then you're really really tied down [mn] i don't know in in california if you hear ah corn beans and florida that's what we are here in the the mid west

364.75 370.32 A: never heard that oh well you you plant your crops in the you you 

365.38 366.30 B: no [noise] 

370.65 383.61 A: the season starts for you about ah about the twentieth of march by that time you're home from florida you plant you get your seed your ground ready your seed planted ah in the middle part of april and ah

433.18 434.13 B: well 

434.53 447.78 B: i'm kind of a believer that everything happens for a reason so i don't know anything really specific that i would go back and change except maybe i might've tried to have children when i was younger i'm thirty five now and ah 

445.64 446.42 A: (( oh )) 

447.83 453.20 B: i haven't gotten married i've had the opportunity several times but ah also haven't had children 

452.83 453.83 A: uh-huh 

453.48 463.42 B: and have developed a fairly serious medical condition and you know thirty five is by no means old but when you have other medical problems and you're thinking about trying to start a family it's like 

463.34 475.23 B: boy i can hardly even you know run around the block now let alone chase kids [laughter] [laughter] so that might be the only thing that if i could go back in time i would change um 

467.08 468.99 A: maybe i've become scary [laughter] 

475.43 477.37 B: but it's so hard to say 'cause 

477.67 481.38 B: you know your life would've turned out so different if you had made other choices 

480.78 485.09 A: right right i'm a i'm a recovered alcoholic so

541.87 545.77 A: um you know my wife suffered and and um 

546.28 560.69 A: be- because of of the condition that ah that i was in most of the time i wasn't i wasn't in a stupor or anything but um you know i was just now you look at it and you say well you were under emotional pressure 

560.60 570.45 A: ah the pressure of farming ah you know the economy was bad and everything and and i i did a lot of it for pleasure you know i mean that that's
