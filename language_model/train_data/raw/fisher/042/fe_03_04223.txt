31.57 33.40 B: i'm always looking for love 

33.09 34.06 A: uh-huh 

33.73 35.43 B: so i would say 

35.71 42.49 B: if i could change things i would do some things different as far as receiving love 

42.14 43.44 A: (( right mhm )) 

42.83 44.44 B: and giving love to someone 

45.32 46.54 B: (( because um )) 

47.29 49.28 B: you know i've fallen into 

49.61 51.86 B: you know fallen in love too fast 

52.14 53.93 B: and not really known the person 

53.74 55.00 A: (( [mn] [mn] right )) 

54.43 57.82 B: so if i could try and go back into time and i could change something 

57.90 59.88 B: i would make things to go slowly 

59.77 61.75 A: right that's a good one that's good 

60.88 62.52 B: i would take my time 

62.74 64.45 B: to really get to know the person 

64.86 73.50 B: and not to see if they have money or they have a nice car or they dress nice that's all on the outside uh material things 

68.26 68.97 A: right 

73.59 78.28 B: so i want to find out as much as i can about them as a person in the inside 

79.60 80.45 A: (( yeah that's )) 

79.70 83.71 B: and you know not really look for looks and material things 

83.39 84.43 A: right 

83.81 90.10 B: you have to find something really really going to stand out so i'm looking for something i would look for something that's really going to stand out 

91.47 92.80 B: (( and um )) 

94.50 96.37 B: you know little things mean a lot 

96.47 97.65 A: mhm 

96.88 102.22 B: it's not really you got to go out your way and do all these big things extravagant things it's the little things that mean a lot 

102.44 106.42 B: if the person is on time and respectful 

107.14 108.55 B: you know um 

108.56 110.21 B: you know they can win your heart 

111.57 114.61 B: but if the person you know like disrespectful 

114.68 117.84 B: (( you know those who have no character don't have no kind of uh of )) 

118.33 120.16 B: character but he's a man 

120.37 123.14 B: because you want somebody who know how to care of themselves 

122.88 125.25 A: (( hm right )) 

124.88 133.03 B: so they show me that they can take care of themselves and you know they can build they can cook they can go and do their laundry they work they're responsible 

133.07 135.44 B: (( you know i i want to get with a person like that )) 

135.36 136.56 A: right

304.62 307.36 B: and sometimes you got to go through a lot to be a better person 

307.50 311.55 A: [sigh] that's true that's true mhm what city do you live in 

308.36 309.70 B: you know so 

311.34 312.96 B: (( i live in new york )) 

312.37 313.41 A: oh me too

320.85 324.11 A: uh this on this website craig's list 

323.85 328.95 B: oh okay we got let's stay on the topic [laughter] we got off a little bit 

326.98 328.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

328.45 336.25 A: okay no that's good i've never i did this two times before and they we never stayed on the topic so you're right let's stick with it [laughter] 

333.63 335.12 B: [laughter] 

335.37 339.63 B: i always try to stick with the topic i always try to do what i'm told 

336.87 338.07 A: that's good 

339.05 340.41 A: okay that's 

339.64 341.42 B: so uh 

342.36 346.87 B: i would change that but i think i would change a lot other things too besides if 

346.92 348.75 B: i could go back into time 

348.57 353.07 A: good [mn] yeah well you know i mean they say hindsight is twenty twenty you can 

352.15 353.46 B: because um 

354.21 356.16 B: i say loving yourself 

356.51 357.69 A: absolutely 

356.71 359.06 B: (( and loving myself much more )) 

358.86 360.26 A: absolutely 

359.68 361.66 B: than i ever loved anyone else 

361.30 363.02 A: that's absolutely true 

362.60 367.51 B: 'cause we always looking for someone else to love us but we really need to love ourself 

365.15 365.90 A: uh-huh 

367.24 368.90 A: right 

368.18 373.12 B: so if i could if i could truly love myself i think a lot of things would change 

373.31 375.03 A: absolutely 

374.70 378.10 B: you know because when you love yourself you you're confident 

377.76 378.71 A: mhm 

378.11 379.84 B: you believe in yourself 

379.28 380.54 A: that's right 

379.92 382.15 B: you know no nobody can tell you 

382.57 385.54 B: (( you don't say you won't feel you won't feel out of place )) 

385.23 391.67 A: you don't need anybody else when you love yourself 'cause you think you need other people to love you but you really only need to love yourself 

386.40 387.45 B: yes 

391.12 392.31 B: yes 

391.95 393.75 A: you know that's so true 

394.29 399.55 B: so that's that's the deep stage that i'm going through i want someone else to love me i want to be in love with somebody else 

399.38 401.10 A: mhm 

400.70 403.95 B: but the thing is i'm around myself all the time 

404.31 405.28 A: right 

404.66 408.35 B: but i'm like i'm missing something i i already know i love me 

408.43 409.66 A: right 

409.07 410.99 B: but i don't love me enough 

410.61 412.10 A: mhm 

411.58 416.55 B: you know i i think i love me enough but i don't but there's something that's still missing 

417.26 422.06 A: [sigh] [mn] i'm definitely in the same boat [laughter] [laughter] 

420.15 421.23 B: [laughter] 

421.52 423.29 B: so i'm trying to 

423.56 426.23 B: be happy by myself 

426.29 428.28 B: be happy without a man 

428.18 429.38 A: mhm 

428.73 431.03 B: because a man really doesn't make a woman 

432.07 432.97 A: (( [mn] sorry )) 

432.68 435.27 B: you know if if they could be a team 

435.43 437.62 B: and you know they could make it with each other 

437.38 438.53 A: right 

437.87 441.60 B: (( you know what i'm saying it all depends on how that person is how their personality is you )) 

442.42 443.91 B: know so 

444.23 448.16 B: i would ch- i would change that i would try to love myself much more 

448.62 451.02 B: because you know like growing up 

451.17 452.46 B: (( i was a target you )) 

452.60 453.40 A: uh-huh 

452.80 458.11 B: know you're alone and you're to yourself and you're a good person you know people tend to tend to target you 

457.83 459.50 A: right 

458.71 461.59 B: so i'd also change fight back 

461.89 466.29 B: you know like now i got a voice i can fight back nobody can't do that to me no more 

466.45 468.17 A: mhm 

467.13 468.48 B: when i was younger 

468.96 471.48 B: (( i didn't have a voice i didn't want i didn't want to fight )) 

472.24 473.91 A: mhm 

473.55 478.65 B: so if i could go into time i wouldn't let nobody uh push me over anymore 

478.71 480.78 A: mhm mhm yeah that's true that's a good one 

480.51 484.65 B: uh you've got to really st- take a stand for yourself if you don't people gonna to walk all over you 

487.07 489.89 B: and you don't fight back you it makes it worse 

490.16 492.13 B: (( 'cause they're going to tease you even more )) 

491.91 494.44 A: (( [mn] huh right right )) 

493.64 496.51 B: so these are all the things that i learned about myself 

496.27 500.09 A: that's they're good they're really good they're important 

499.23 501.75 B: and you know trying to change 

502.01 512.38 B: and you know i've changed a lot of bad habits and i still have a lot of bad habits because i i try to carry the world on my shoulders so i if i could back into time i would try to change that too 

512.68 513.52 A: uh-huh 

512.86 516.89 B: and let people know when i need help because i try to do everything by myself 

516.59 517.85 A: mhm 

517.47 526.64 B: (( because i'm used to being by myself i'm used to doing things by myself i'm not used to having a partner i'm not used to having nobody there i'm not used to having no friends so i do it myself )) 

526.35 527.72 A: mhm 

527.24 533.07 B: so in a way it's kinda good in a way it's kinda bad because really i'm a people person 

534.20 535.74 B: and 

536.20 538.45 B: you know sometimes people disappoint you 

538.33 539.55 A: yeah 

538.95 541.71 B: you know they're not going to be what you want them to be sometimes 

541.27 542.41 A: right 

541.81 546.46 B: so i'm learning to deal with that accepting things as they are 

546.90 551.78 B: and learning to deal with that if i could go back in time i would try to accept things more as they are 

552.56 553.57 B: you know 

553.59 556.11 B: (( oh that's the way it is and nothing i can do about it )) 

556.14 557.42 B: and leave it alone 

558.02 560.40 B: (( you know 'cause we always trying to fix things )) 

559.92 561.16 A: yeah 

560.87 564.88 B: trying to change people we can't change nobody but ourself 

565.43 568.18 B: so we're putting the energy into the wrong thing 

567.36 569.10 A: (( [noise] right )) 

568.50 571.60 B: (( so if i can go back to time i don't want to waste time no more )) 

571.23 572.43 A: mhm 

571.72 574.50 B: (( i don't want to waste time with idiotic things )) 

574.67 577.62 B: you know i'm saying things that i cannot change 

577.29 578.22 A: right 

577.67 581.79 B: (( if i cannot change them i'm moving on let me go to something else that i can change )) 

581.44 582.35 A: yes 

582.47 584.70 B: so you know i don't want to waste time 

586.25 588.00 B: on on on nothing you 

589.31 590.71 A: that's good yeah 

589.43 592.61 B: know because it don't make no sense to me 

592.82 594.37 A: yeah life is short 

594.07 599.89 B: yes and it don't make no sense you know trying to get someone to love you you know either they love
