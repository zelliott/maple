328.63 342.78 B: pr- probably yeah high school was really big and college too i really goofed around i was mostly flying at the local field you know 'cause the 'cause the unfortunately oh yeah i know what i would change this is the big probably the biggest thing when i was when i was uh when i went down to uh 

332.97 333.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

339.29 341.08 A: what's that [noise] 

342.96 350.55 B: to uh school went in to see the counselor and went and took exams and i i was always a literate type you know re- read an awful lot you know and uh 

347.39 349.22 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

350.64 357.44 B: and uh but didn't do much in school they would tie me down you know they they would send the teach- send they'd send one of my buddies to get me out of the library

372.24 373.20 A: sheesh 

373.61 380.94 B: but any rate i would probably do just what the counselor said when he took up my test he said well you did very well in the test everything was fine he says uh
