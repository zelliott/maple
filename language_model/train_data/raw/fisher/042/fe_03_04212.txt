49.52 50.51 A: (( oh )) 

55.53 62.25 B: i'd have grabbed the baby and been out of the state before the ink on the decree was dry [laughter]

65.41 67.37 A: yeah 

66.57 73.47 B: everybody told me i should have just left 'cause i'd have had a better chance if i'd have been out of state when all the paperwork went through 

73.94 83.52 B: and i stayed and stuck it out and thought we'd have a fair fight and it didn't go that way and now i realize i should i would have had more leverage if i'd been somewhere else 

84.24 84.86 B: (( so )) 

84.30 85.45 A: (( well i'm )) 

85.87 89.83 A: sorry you've had to experience something like that i've 

87.02 88.52 B: (( [laughter] )) 

90.15 92.95 A: have in this situation i've 

93.74 97.86 A: worked with the church and if i do 

98.31 99.38 A: work with 

99.61 103.28 A: different situations that others have experienced similar 

103.30 106.28 A: things and it's it's not easy and that's a 

107.95 110.98 A: very be a very challenging time 

112.42 114.33 A: so i hope things will go 

114.90 117.72 A: will go well for you in your life 

117.53 123.09 B: mm well we're still trying we're in the appeals process now which is no less ghastly but [sigh] 

123.76 125.50 A: yeah 

123.86 130.35 B: i've heard i've heard this typically once a child's involved can actually last a couple of years in court 

129.94 131.02 A: oh 

131.23 135.00 B: which is is just horrible it's just dragging on 

135.98 138.09 A: well i'm sure you have uh 

139.26 141.14 A: the greatest concern for 

142.16 143.49 A: for the child 

144.62 152.43 B: oh yeah i i've definitely reassessed my priorities there were so many things to argue about when this all started 

152.53 158.52 B: and at this point i'm very clear if i take if i leave with my son and nothing else i really don't care 

158.29 160.10 A: (( mhm )) 

159.10 160.92 B: nothing else is important 

161.00 166.02 B: so if nothing else i've left the experience with a really strong [laughter] sense of where my priorities are 

168.40 172.47 A: well sometimes i guess we have to go through difficult 

173.62 181.40 A: circumstances to really appreciate maybe a lot of times the good parts that we ha- do have in life and 

183.28 184.79 A: i think [sigh] i 

185.33 187.62 A: was just trying to think in my own 

187.95 189.33 A: (( [mn] uh )) 

190.48 193.18 A: situation of what to 

194.66 197.46 A: [mn] to change i guess one of my biggest [sigh] 

198.07 203.91 A: challenges is despite my work is of working with 

205.29 208.30 A: [mn] certain situations where i 

208.60 211.05 A: get frustrated or even 

211.55 214.43 A: angry and and 

214.65 215.62 A: (( uh )) 

215.91 217.06 A: just how 

217.11 218.66 A: maybe i could have 

219.48 225.88 A: managed things better when i was younger i'm i'm sixty one now and and when i was 

229.37 231.94 A: younger i i think if i'd [sigh] 

232.01 233.44 A: handled things 

234.12 237.60 A: differently well i i might well of you know like 

238.49 240.48 A: uh i mean i don't go round 

240.72 246.73 A: beating my wife or anything ever like like that but you know 

242.42 243.71 B: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

248.26 249.94 A: just dealing with 

250.47 254.45 A: with the na- with the natural frustrations that come along in 

254.49 257.54 A: all all of our lives and 

257.64 262.99 A: but i do think that things have improved over the the years but there's still a 

263.73 265.72 A: an area where i feel 

267.06 273.83 A: uh personally when i look back at different situations if i'd 

275.25 280.16 A: had have handled them with with more maturity well 

281.27 285.46 A: it it would have made things better most most of all for 

286.04 287.28 A: for me 

287.28 288.01 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

288.20 295.20 B: [laughter] i know maturity's one of those things you never have enough of until it's too late [laughter] [mn] [noise] 

294.36 295.64 A: well that's 

296.20 298.76 A: that's for sure and 

300.94 302.07 A: but we 

303.24 304.10 A: uh 

306.08 307.94 A: do have so much to be 

308.97 311.18 A: thankful for and [sigh] 

311.40 313.59 A: and i think especially with our 

313.90 317.55 A: youngest daughter we kind of work do those things 

319.08 322.06 A: and situations together and it's it's 

323.24 325.43 A: helped bring about a i 

325.53 328.65 A: think a lot more a lot more closeness and we 

332.39 333.60 B: how old's your daughter 

333.85 337.66 A: just well we have have two daughters and have 

337.89 338.85 A: uh 

339.38 345.19 A: one's uh thirty two or well just about thirty three and the other's thirty one and [mn] 

347.26 350.05 A: eight grandchildren and 

351.30 352.29 A: so i 

352.39 354.85 A: i'm not just sure how that relates to 

355.28 359.44 A: the pri- [laughter] the primary topic but 

358.20 365.55 B: [noise] oh just because you mentioned your your youngest daughter i just wondered how old a person we were talking about [laughter] [mn] 

360.95 364.46 A: yeah well no i didn't mean in regard to your asking 

364.61 370.35 A: i meant in my getting off in that direction i guess [laughter] 

368.23 371.77 B: oh [laughter] maybe a little [laughter] 

372.31 374.19 A: (( [laughter] well but )) 

374.09 378.72 B: i guess it was if you had any like a specific instance that you would have gone back and changed 

380.59 382.38 A: (( well )) 

383.82 387.84 B: if there was one particular moment that you think would have made a difference [sigh] 

389.34 392.68 A: well a particular moment i i have a real 

393.20 396.74 A: challenge just off the cuff of thinking of a particular 

397.76 399.29 A: (( situation uh )) 

403.33 404.94 A: that's an interesting 

405.46 407.47 A: conversation uh 

406.89 408.65 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

407.49 409.67 A: my my mind is 

410.45 411.80 A: blank but 

414.93 415.87 A: oh 

421.35 426.12 A: well one regret that i've always had it's still not a particular situation but i 

427.25 429.56 A: i was just so while our 

430.31 443.93 A: two daughters were growing up uh when i look back now i was i was so busy time often times in the homes of other people that uh you know i've really come to feel like i 

445.00 446.51 A: neglected to 

446.77 455.35 A: you know to a high degree my own children as far as being home more in the evenings and uh 

456.31 462.15 A: this nature of thing and that that's a a genuine regret 

464.07 465.81 B: yeah i know what you mean 

465.95 472.38 B: my mom told me a story i think it's a fable about a cobbler whose own children never seemed to have shoes 

472.56 476.61 B: you know because he's always helping the neighbors and the community [mn] 

473.53 475.57 A: (( oh yes )) 

478.24 479.34 B: (( and so )) 

478.86 481.88 A: [mn] a very good illustration it's 

483.49 487.26 A: but i'm proud of of our daughters and their 

483.95 484.54 B: (( yes )) 

489.31 491.07 A: their husbands 'cause they 

491.80 493.34 A: they they 

493.63 494.46 A: uh 

494.50 504.17 A: spend so much time with with their children and involve with you know in their school and their education and their activities at home and 

504.23 506.98 A: and this sort of thing and 

509.40 510.20 A: so 

511.65 515.29 A: it's certainly tells me maybe things have turned out pretty well and 

515.29 516.10 B: (( [mn] [noise] [laughter] )) 

516.36 517.72 A: (( for that )) 

517.74 519.97 A: for that we're very grateful 

520.02 520.96 B: yeah 

524.23 526.68 A: but that's a uh that's a 

527.25 530.72 A: a good illustration of with the with the cobbler i'll 

531.54 537.07 A: sometime when i'm asked to speak that i'll have to remember that but [laughter] 

534.82 536.13 B: [laughter] 

538.63 544.59 B: [mn] i know i had to make a lot of decisions like that in this last year there were so many things that needed to be done 

544.67 549.83 B: and part of it was i was a stay at home mom and had expected to be for the first coupla years 

547.03 548.68 A: yeah 

549.91 551.48 A: (( oh right )) 

550.02 556.97 B: and instead had to be working and there were times when i had to choose between serving other people's families and being home with him 

557.55 561.05 B: and it was very difficult for me to put him in daycare for the first time 

562.30 563.36 A: (( yeah well )) 

564.09 570.33 A: well i can appreciate that and i guess to some degree there's some some parallel there with what 

570.85 573.25 A: you were wanting to do and what i [sigh] 

574.58 576.69 A: should have done and and 

580.46 581.12 A: (( uh )) 

581.68 582.95 A: not that i 

584.52 588.39 A: i hope that it will work out that 

588.87 591.80 A: that the two of you will be able to 

592.26 596.70 A: to work together of course that's easy for me to say but 

596.81 598.82 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] yeah ))
