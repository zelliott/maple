1.19 2.39 A: hello 

2.16 3.76 B: hi i'm anna 

3.55 4.84 A: (( hi i'm andrew )) 

4.80 6.10 B: nice to meet you 

6.03 7.31 A: okay [sigh] 

7.21 10.14 B: would you go back in time and change something that you've done 

11.60 13.06 A: (( well uh )) 

15.09 17.54 A: actually i wouldn't [mn] 

16.88 19.47 B: i don't think i would either [laughter] 

18.99 20.99 A: [laughter] what's 

20.38 25.65 B: i i think i sort of like the way my life is now and i don't think i'd change anything about 

21.15 21.92 A: like 

25.36 31.00 A: [sigh] well if you do change something it means there are consequences that you cannot predict [noise] [noise] [noise] 

29.98 42.59 B: it yeah [sigh] i think you're right i think it would i think it'd change everything i think it would make everything sort of topsy turvy [sigh] and make it so that i mean i think it would make everything weird and bad and not 

44.35 49.82 A: yeah it'd be s- it'd be so unpredictable that you know you can't like 

50.04 51.54 A: like um 

51.62 59.15 A: you you don't know when or what will happen you could like end up with like a extra testicle or something [laughter] 

53.33 54.69 B: (( good [laughter] [sigh] yeah )) 

57.61 59.21 B: [laughter] yeah 

60.26 62.17 B: hopefully not for me [laughter] yeah 

61.51 65.25 A: [sigh] [laughter] hey you never know [laughter] 

65.49 77.82 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] but it could you know it could have something some really [noise] bad effects on everything i mean it could you know mean the end of the world or the end of your life or the end of the life of people that you love or 

69.72 73.82 A: hm yeah and 

77.29 78.14 A: oh 

78.41 80.68 B: the end of something 

81.35 89.60 A: well [noise] or or the thing would change and everything would be good but then the odds of that happening is like you know you don't want to take that risk 

88.87 90.31 B: yeah 

92.25 96.94 A: then it but then if you can predict i guess it would be really good [laughter] 

92.40 94.20 B: (( yeah [noise] yeah )) 

97.16 99.33 B: if it was for sure i mean 

100.34 101.40 B: i don't know 

101.81 103.23 B: it would just be so strange 

104.79 106.35 B: i guess i don't think 

106.58 111.17 B: [sigh] i can't think of anything that's that important that i'd want to go back and change 

112.85 113.81 B: can you 

114.48 128.48 A: well how 'bout something like beyond you like like if you could like not have someone die or have world peace or something like that would you choose to do that [mn] [sigh] 

126.53 127.55 B: yeah 

128.33 132.96 B: i guess that's just too big i don't know that that would work [laughter] 

133.19 135.07 A: well if you knew it did 

135.18 136.85 A: would you do it [mn] 

136.68 142.75 B: i think so to a certain extent if i knew it would work without any consequences if it would work perfectly 

142.94 145.80 B: [sigh] then i'd do it but i think that's a lot to ask for [sigh] i think 

146.35 147.79 B: that if it is pretty 

149.10 150.28 B: pretty big i 

150.96 153.78 B: think that that's too much to ask for would you 

151.25 151.89 A: (( yeah )) 

154.41 155.31 A: oh 

155.90 158.63 A: yeah i think i would something 

158.71 160.65 A: something really could happen 

160.71 167.67 A: [mn] and you know nothing you predict w- will happen but if it's unpredictable it would be too hard to do 

167.54 168.45 B: yeah 

169.38 175.26 B: [sigh] i wouldn't want bad things to come of what i thought was going to be a good thing though 

175.34 179.95 B: like i wouldn't want people to suffer in the end [sigh] but if there are too many variables 

177.90 178.99 A: yeah who 

180.16 183.62 A: and who are you to choose that that variable 

181.82 182.78 B: i know 

184.54 188.58 B: i know what's one person's world peace is another person's hell so mhm 

189.20 199.51 A: i think someone with a very big ego would would do it someone that's how like those big dictators and uh that's how they caused those genocides and stuff 

199.54 200.75 A: like hitler 

200.70 201.64 B: yeah 

200.89 203.05 A: he tried to change everything 

202.78 207.72 B: yeah no definitely [sigh] or even now 

208.22 210.46 B: even just deciding that one 

210.70 212.90 B: one way is better than another way 

213.78 215.55 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

214.07 218.01 B: yeah that being in the u._s. is better than being any place else in the world 

220.03 223.01 B: it's just sort of a strange thing you just never know 

223.19 224.51 B: who's going to be 

224.54 226.47 B: (( who's going to suffer in the long )) 

228.35 230.51 B: run that's sort of a hard call to make 

228.45 229.19 A: (( [noise] that's )) 

230.94 234.92 B: [sigh] but yeah i don't i guess i never really thought about time travel 

235.01 235.68 A: (( [laughter] )) 

235.89 238.83 B: [laughter] it's never really been an issue for me [laughter] 

240.20 242.00 A: [laughter] well [mn] 

243.15 244.62 B: isn't there a movie 

243.19 249.06 A: well the possibility the the possibility of time travel is really interesting 

248.03 248.95 B: yeah 

248.99 249.99 B: i think it 

249.19 250.28 A: but then 

250.74 253.48 A: not like myself travelling [laughter] 

252.73 255.50 B: i don't think i would do it personally mhm 

255.60 256.31 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

255.80 258.18 B: i think i'd i don't even think i'd go to space 

258.65 259.68 A: really 

259.46 260.72 B: i don't know would you 

261.91 264.57 A: (( i think if i had the chance i would )) 

266.30 269.13 A: but that's just me more adventurous [laughter] 

268.50 273.09 B: hm yeah i don't know i think i'd be afraid of of dying 

273.15 274.26 B: in space by 

277.29 278.47 A: (( [noise] [noise] well )) 

277.74 279.19 B: (( myself [sigh] i guess i don't know )) 

279.29 280.03 A: well 

280.42 282.92 A: the ex- the whole experience would be great 

282.29 286.54 B: yeah i guess seeing the world from really far away would be really beautiful 

283.02 284.10 A: (( [noise] [sigh] )) 

287.86 289.67 B: just a different perspective 

288.24 289.31 A: (( i think what )) 

289.92 298.15 A: uh what would really would be helpful would be looking back in time what how actually happened instead of going back in time 

293.82 294.77 B: mhm 

299.11 302.87 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] so you could make better choices in the future [lipsmack] 

302.59 304.75 B: mhm mhm no i think that's really true 

306.32 310.63 A: (( and in that way we've learned in that way we would have learned history and stuff )) 

306.49 308.04 B: i think that's really true mhm 

311.56 312.45 A: so 

311.57 319.88 B: that's very true [sigh] it would be better than than changing the the past in some ways and just seeing what went wrong 

312.75 314.44 A: we don't make the same mistakes 

321.45 323.36 B: and trying not to repeat it 

321.74 322.88 A: yeah 

325.13 328.00 B: [lipsmack] i think that sounds like a much better idea 

330.58 331.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

331.35 332.87 B: are you on a cell phone 

332.11 334.27 A: [noise] oh yeah [sigh]

352.97 353.95 B: oh really

356.23 359.22 B: yeah it's only it's half an hour 

359.38 361.44 B: it's not that bad it's sort of interesting 

360.38 362.57 A: (( yeah [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

364.42 366.70 B: are you in los angeles 

366.43 368.22 A: yeah

386.91 389.75 A: (( oh yeah it sounds like this is [laughter] )) 

389.74 392.88 B: i think it's to see the way people talk to each other mhm 

393.06 394.41 A: oh really 

396.03 397.59 B: about different subjects 

396.06 397.73 A: they get paid [laughter] [sigh] [laughter] 

399.35 401.33 B: yeah i guess that's what's important 

400.84 401.73 A: (( [lipsmack] [noise] )) 

404.86 411.28 B: but yeah so it's i guess it's to ask people provocative questions like you know 

411.50 418.31 B: time travel and whatnot [sigh] yesterday they asked if you could sp- start a business what would it be and how would you do it 

418.53 421.96 A: yeah these topics are really interesting but like [laughter] 

422.31 426.21 A: they call you and you're like might inconvenience yourself [sigh] 

426.12 427.79 B: oh did they call you 

427.95 430.50 A: yeah don't they don't they call you 

429.61 431.71 B: no i've been calling them

433.33 436.91 A: they call me they call me every day [laughter] 

435.99 439.41 B: oh really you can call them instead of them calling you

439.63 441.68 A: (( oh oh oh [laughter] i )) 

441.84 443.41 B: do you want me to give you the number

455.10 457.95 A: (( really all right then ))

474.27 475.28 A: (( yeah )) 

475.86 478.33 B: i think if it's written down it's always possible 

478.64 484.94 A: it's like well when this light passes over a black hole the light slows down 

483.04 483.94 B: mhm
