182.07 183.04 B: uh 

183.15 190.57 B: warm it up and he came home and it just got to hurting so bad that we had to go to the hospital

206.66 207.85 A: yeah 

209.28 213.48 A: [laughter] is workmen's comp gonna cover it or 

213.08 214.38 B: well that's 

214.64 220.10 B: we don't know 'cause it it was about eleven o'clock at night when it happened 'cause he was on call 

220.16 221.06 A: (( oh )) 

221.99 227.84 A: so it's not like you guys' own business or anything right he works for somebody else 

225.26 226.27 B: oh no 

227.12 228.16 B: yeah 

228.88 231.72 A: uh they should cover it it happened at work 

231.38 233.05 B: yeah they should but 

234.06 239.01 A: luckily since mine happened at work they're having to cover that 

239.29 240.80 A: too so 

240.80 242.23 B: well that's good 

241.60 248.78 A: but uh i guess um the way it works is you have to be out of work for a week before they start paying you 

248.63 250.11 B: (( oh geez oh [sigh] )) 

249.65 252.19 A: yeah so pretty much 

252.76 261.97 A: from what i understand is that you lose out on a week of salary or however you get paid you'd lose that it goes pretty much down the drain 

262.39 264.53 A: but any time after that 

264.79 266.22 A: you can get paid 

267.86 270.74 B: hopefully we won't have to go through that 

270.11 272.43 A: yeah that really sucks 

272.69 275.89 B: yeah and none of the doctors knew what to do 

276.05 278.96 B: 'cause it they they said it was like a freak accident 

278.49 280.15 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

279.29 288.42 B: but he had to he had to put his hands up 'cause it was shooting right in his face so he had to put his hands up to block his face and if that would've got his face he could've 

283.76 284.82 A: yeah 

288.58 290.20 B: (( it could've been a lot worse )) 

290.00 291.38 A: yeah it could've 

293.97 296.93 A: so what's his like what's his skin look like 

296.70 299.02 B: it's all like black it's weird 

299.05 301.24 A: really like it's burned 

299.61 300.29 B: (( it's )) 

301.07 303.54 B: yeah it's just like frostbite 

303.76 306.80 A: see i've never seen frostbite before so 

306.97 308.83 B: i hadn't neither until i 

309.13 314.49 B: [sigh] saw it last night uh it it's just it's nasty it's just dead skin 

314.79 316.35 A: (( [mn] geez )) 

319.43 320.67 A: that sucks 

320.66 322.49 B: yeah 

322.65 325.33 B: especially when his boss is being a jerk about it 

325.59 326.66 A: really 

326.34 336.62 B: yeah 'cause he says well you should've got outta the way but the air conditioning unit was underneath a house he was on his stomach underneath a house he couldn't just get up and run 

336.40 337.43 A: right 

337.29 341.39 B: and he had to block it from his face 'cause it's never ever happened before 

341.54 346.16 B: the doctors here t- have no clue how to treat a freon burn 

346.47 347.88 B: because 

348.55 357.02 B: you know it's never happened before like little ones if freon gets on ya and it just your skin kinda peels off on the top layers but 

350.52 351.59 A: right 

357.99 360.47 A: his whole hand was frozen with 

358.77 366.03 B: yeah his whole hand and he cou- he couldn't feel anything stuff like sharp throbbing pain and 

366.26 367.75 B: it was awful 

368.29 371.55 B: i felt so bad but they got him lots of pain pills so 

371.54 373.93 A: it yeah they didn't um 

374.06 377.96 A: put me on pain pills unto two days after i had to go back in 

378.38 379.83 A: 'cause they um 

380.76 385.81 A: they thought the pain was just caused by inflammation so they gave me um 

385.98 392.96 A: medication for that but as far as the pain went it didn't go down at all it actually got worse 

393.26 399.31 A: so i had to go then again and i've had like three different kinds of braces on 

399.30 400.58 B: (( oh my god )) 

399.82 402.23 A: and now i finally they put a 

402.57 409.67 A: it's it's like cast material um but it's only like on half of my arm 

409.80 410.56 B: hm 

409.95 420.99 A: like the thumb side of my arm it covers and they wrapped an ace bandage around it so half of my arm has a hard cast and half just has the ace bandage 

411.52 412.63 B: yeah 

421.40 422.60 A: but um 

422.90 427.83 A: for some reason like it feels like my arm is on fire underneath 

427.62 428.76 B: yeah 

428.14 433.05 A: where the hard part is i don't know if it's just 'cause it's hot or 

433.07 436.66 A: or what but it feels like it's on fire [laughter] 

436.23 440.03 B: it's between like hot and itchy and burning and

439.81 443.12 A: [laughter] i'm like trying to um 

440.48 441.81 B: yeah i had a 

442.08 445.26 B: cast one time and it was awful 

444.69 451.09 A: i'm trying to like get my skin off the cast so i can blow in there at least get some cool air going in there 

450.10 451.34 B: yeah

487.47 488.74 B: (( [laughter] i )) 

489.49 496.76 A: i don't expect i don't see how they can expect somebody to talk about time travel for ten minutes to somebody they don't know [laughter]

498.38 500.39 B: (( it's weird ))
