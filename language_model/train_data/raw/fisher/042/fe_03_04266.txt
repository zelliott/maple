90.37 104.82 B: but like his brother i i'm i was still really good friends with and even though we weren't going out it's just such a a weird situation and [sigh] like he he doesn't even acknowledge my son 

100.71 101.75 A: oh it is 

105.01 105.90 B: and 

105.69 108.23 A: this is not the father but the brother

108.49 111.92 A: [sigh] he doesn't uh does oh that's really 

110.14 121.11 B: he because he he's holding like such a grudge if i had the opportunity to go back in time i would like try to fix it somehow [sigh] like [sigh] not go out with him or something or [laughter] 

117.87 118.98 A: n- does he 

120.34 127.89 A: does he resent you or uh and the child or does he resent the fact that you're going out with his brother or w- what's his deal 

127.58 129.92 B: [mn] i think he's [noise] 

131.46 133.27 B: just like hurt 

133.37 137.21 A: [noise] hurt that you're that that it hap- that [mn] that it happened 

137.15 138.49 B: (( yeah )) 

138.26 141.41 A: [sigh] yeah but that was i mean that's [sigh] 

140.85 146.38 B: it it's such a strange situation like like i don't even know how to explain it [sigh] 'cause it's 

144.83 145.82 A: (( do you )) 

146.08 152.98 A: do you see um [lipsmack] how often [mn] how often do you see this the the brother the other guy 

152.35 153.25 B: um 

153.15 159.40 A: i mean is it uh something like you see him on a on a monthl- or like a weekly basis or oh really 

157.44 160.33 B: yeah because he still lives with his parents 

160.32 161.95 A: oh 

161.45 165.44 B: so every time we have to go to the grandparents' house [sigh] 

162.05 163.65 A: oh s- [mn] we 

163.68 167.58 A: oh [sigh] then you have to s- oh 

167.22 168.73 B: yeah so 

167.82 170.50 A: that's really an uncomfortable situation [lipsmack] 

169.92 171.78 B: and though it's like 

172.86 174.23 A: that's really 

173.09 177.35 B: well both him and i are we're like really fond of each other 

177.05 178.00 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

177.65 178.61 B: but 

179.09 187.84 B: as much as we like i was the one trying to work out the the relationship when i was with him and he was just like not there he was he was 

186.13 188.72 A: he he wasn't [sigh] so and 

187.85 191.99 B: basically treating me like a friend rather than a girlfriend 

191.06 195.10 A: [sigh] so then he doesn't have any right to be acting like that 

194.45 202.80 B: well even though he was treating me like that he swears to everyone under the sun that he was in love with me beyond anything else blah blah blah [sigh] 

201.09 201.92 A: [lipsmack] 

202.09 205.27 A: well that's a pretty strange way to treat someone you love [sigh] 

204.81 213.36 B: i w- if if but like if i had the the chance to go back in time i would probably try to end the relationship sooner than i did 

212.81 220.03 A: or maybe never have met h- well no you couldn't have actually never met him but yeah [sigh] huh that's really odd 

220.81 222.10 B: so [laughter] 

221.25 223.57 A: too bad that you have to see him so often 

223.83 225.45 A: too bad he doesn't move out 

224.79 226.78 B: (( [sigh] [laughter] )) 

226.12 228.21 A: [laughter] move away 

228.25 230.76 A: wouldn't that kind of solve the problem a little bit [laughter] 

230.35 231.76 B: (( [sigh] a little )) 

231.17 239.04 A: a little bit i mean probably not totally [sigh] you'd think that he would be grown up enough to just sort of let bygones be by- bygones and 

238.98 239.88 B: yeah 

239.01 246.19 A: [mn] kind of just come to terms with the fact that hey you're you're you know going to be in the picture for a while [laughter] you know you're there 

246.18 249.51 B: it's like it's he's not being nasty about it it's just 

248.49 254.31 A: but he's just not being he's just being like sounds like he's just being neutral like totally cold i 

253.68 254.68 B: yeah 

254.64 258.63 A: mean not nasty but [mn] nothing almost 

256.49 257.41 B: (( but [mn] )) 

257.78 259.77 B: at the same time like i blame 

260.28 261.46 B: myself 

261.34 262.35 A: (( well )) 

261.72 266.02 B: not really him so much i can't really blame him for for feeling like that but 

265.27 267.53 A: well you shouldn't blame yourself either 

267.33 268.97 B: [laughter] 

268.04 269.65 A: why would you i mean [mn] 

269.83 271.70 A: you you have nothing to 

272.06 275.41 A: be you have nothing to feel badly about [sigh] 

276.09 277.18 A: (( at all )) 

277.26 279.65 B: (( [sigh] i don't know i guess [laughter] i don't know )) 

279.26 284.62 A: you know that's his deal if he's acting like that that's his deal [sigh] not yours 

284.12 285.03 B: true 

284.75 287.07 A: especially if you're in a um 

287.22 291.19 A: if you're doing nothing to encourage it you're just do- you're just being who you are 

291.71 292.73 B: yeah 

292.10 294.46 A: you know you're not int- into 

293.28 300.90 B: [sigh] i guess i just feel like if i if i had ended the relationship rather than making it go on so long [sigh] that 

299.89 301.98 A: that maybe this wouldn't have happened 

301.27 304.93 B: yeah maybe he wouldn't have have felt like 

305.99 308.79 B: i don't know still kind of like attached to me somehow 

308.39 310.97 A: (( hm [sigh] yeah )) 

310.78 316.43 B: where if i tried to like make myself more distant from him in the in like the 

316.89 320.11 B: the past whatever years since we broke up 

319.62 320.99 A: how many years has it been 

321.13 322.24 B: (( [sigh] five )) 

321.96 323.23 A: wow 

323.32 330.46 B: it's just he didn't he wasn't like told about me and his brother 

330.80 332.58 B: going out again [sigh] 

332.01 334.27 A: how did he find out just 

333.93 335.63 B: uh somebody else told him 

335.20 336.57 A: (( oh so [mn] )) 

336.00 342.40 B: so it like it even like [sigh] i i had tried giving i had tried to bring up the the subject 

336.98 337.84 A: oh 

342.26 343.14 A: (( mhm )) 

342.45 344.46 B: and he told me he didn't want to hear it 

344.53 346.56 A: [mn] oh so you tried to [mn] 

345.22 351.01 B: and then like a week after i had tried to have that conversation with him somebody turned around and told him 

348.82 349.80 A: yeah 

350.53 355.42 A: oh so you tried to approach him initially but he he just didn't want to really talk about it 

354.77 358.61 B: yeah so he he feels like we did it behind his back too 

355.50 356.52 A: (( oh )) 

357.40 364.48 A: [sigh] oh so he feels like he heard it through the grapevine kind of oh [sigh] well how old is he

364.03 365.71 B: [mn] he's twenty seven 

365.54 373.38 A: well he should get over it now i mean that's he's he's [laughter] he's old enough to not be behaving so immaturely 

367.79 369.57 B: [laughter] 

373.50 377.63 A: or to at least [sigh] realize that that's the past let's move on 

378.03 379.33 B: i guess 

378.69 380.55 A: i think i don't know 

380.16 381.33 B: (( [laughter] i don't know )) 

381.22 385.34 A: i would imagine that's what i would want to have or want to do 

387.89 388.69 A: hm 

387.90 393.27 B: like 'cause i would i i [sigh] i would want to try to change that rather than try and trying to change 

393.29 395.12 B: having my son because 

394.90 402.55 A: [lipsmack] oh of c- of course [laughter] [sigh] [mn] no you just would want to make things so they're not so awkward i

410.84 411.94 B: yeah 

412.80 413.64 A: (( well )) 

413.58 424.80 B: 'cause when they said the topic i could have like thought of [sigh] like a million and one other like stupid things like since my parents passed away like i i'd go back in time to see them or something like that but [sigh] 

418.96 420.32 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

421.38 422.34 A: oh 

423.25 432.88 A: right that's h- yeah i mean there's a lot of things i regret and wish i could change but [sigh] one of them was just what i did to my friend which was really lame [laughter] [sigh] 

433.10 433.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

433.60 438.10 B: no it that's not really lame 'cause like like friendships are important
