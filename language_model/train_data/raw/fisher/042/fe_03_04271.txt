0.04 1.22 A: kevin 

1.75 3.18 B: maureen 

4.61 5.36 A: (( [noise] )) 

5.46 6.30 A: hello 

5.92 8.90 B: hi [laughter] how are you [sigh] 

6.41 7.44 A: hi 

8.21 10.73 A: pre- okay um [lipsmack] 

9.05 10.88 B: (( [laughter] good [sigh] )) 

11.23 14.46 A: well i think for me um [noise] 

15.13 21.56 A: actually the most obvious answer to that question is is ultra personal so i guess we're not going to discuss that 

20.99 24.16 B: yeah i know [laughter] i kind of felt the same way too [sigh] 

23.59 24.88 A: but um 

25.80 27.49 A: (( [noise] [lipsmack] i think )) 

28.16 36.78 A: [noise] i just don't believe in it because if you go back [noise] into [noise] like er correct your mistakes then 

36.59 43.86 A: [noise] then you go back and don't learn from them and so it's it's [noise] 

39.79 40.82 B: yeah 

44.16 49.71 A: i don't know i i it's it's hard for me 'cause i don't even believe in the question [noise] but 

48.35 49.78 B: yeah 

50.28 59.13 B: no actually i uh [sigh] i i kind of feel the same way like wh- you know when people say what it's kind of like a regret the question what do you regret 

58.70 60.26 A: (( [lipsmack] [noise] right )) 

59.16 63.41 B: and i i don't [sigh] i don't see much point in 

64.10 66.59 B: [noise] regretting things like you may not 

65.59 66.17 A: (( [noise] )) 

66.68 77.23 B: be glad about the way they turned out but what's the point in regretting it if you when you can't change it like you said you know it's that you can go back and change things [sigh] and 

68.90 72.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

76.42 77.53 A: [noise] 

77.54 78.91 B: do i mean 

79.38 80.72 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [cough] )) 

79.91 83.26 B: it doesn't help anything you have you have to learn from what you did 

81.23 90.30 A: [noise] right right and the only thing that you do learn from is is uh [noise] honest you know [noise] full searching thoughts so 

89.88 90.76 B: right 

91.29 93.15 A: [noise] yeah 

93.26 95.42 A: [noise] but i mean [noise] 

96.43 103.83 A: so maybe it would be something trivial then [laughter] that i would go back and change but i'd be afraid to do that too because you know 

99.90 101.11 B: [laughter] 

103.91 105.75 B: you never know what it would have affect it 

105.52 109.85 A: yeah yeah 

106.14 108.84 B: can change everything even something trivial 

108.93 110.79 B: [noise] [sigh] me too [sigh] [lipsmack] 

110.86 112.57 A: (( but )) 

112.59 113.90 A: (( i i don't know )) 

112.81 119.40 B: i can think of one thing that [sigh] i mean just been trying to think of something for the sake of discussion that 

116.56 121.05 A: mhm 

119.48 125.35 B: that i would like to have done like for instance uh when i was in college uh a few years ago 

121.81 122.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

122.83 126.71 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

125.42 127.70 B: (( i would have )) 

127.93 129.81 B: started my 

129.05 129.78 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

130.76 140.26 B: i would have started my focus in um photography earlier so that i got into the classes sooner could've done more with them and 

134.22 137.63 A: mhm 

140.90 149.43 B: oh [sigh] would've tried to learn more about what to do with that degree once i'm out of college [laughter] i'm not doing anything with it [laughter] right now [laughter] i was just thinking about that today in 

145.07 146.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

146.85 148.03 A: (( right [noise] )) 

149.72 152.02 B: uh context and something else so 

151.39 153.24 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] and that is what you do now 

153.09 157.35 B: i don't i don't do anything with with photography now i [laughter] don't 

154.62 155.54 A: (( [noise] [noise] okay )) 

157.42 163.02 B: nothing even remotely related to my degree which is okay i didn't get the degree like as a 

163.51 176.09 B: like a necessary path directly to a job i just wanted to learn while i was in college but um i do wish that i had had a little more opportunity to do things with uh the photography after i got my degree 

167.33 167.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

169.08 174.77 A: (( right )) 

176.57 184.85 A: yeah [noise] [lipsmack] yeah i think if i could go back to [noise] college [noise] wow i would i'd be uh different but uh 

183.81 184.85 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

185.09 190.80 A: [noise] i would [noise] i would probably finish [laughter] [noise] and [noise] 

191.78 192.34 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

193.29 204.49 A: i think i would i learned a lot in college but [noise] but not necessarily uh through studies [noise] i [noise] i learned in the class room and i learned [noise] like the very basic [noise] things that i had to do to get by [noise] but i didn't 

198.30 199.24 B: yeah 

204.53 207.45 A: did not pursue [noise] um 

207.61 214.48 A: book knowledge [noise] like like i would [noise] like i do now i'm like [noise] i would if i [noise] you know if i were in class 

211.67 212.55 B: right 

217.59 221.28 A: [noise] [lipsmack] 

220.06 222.09 B: yeah i would change a lot of how i 

222.10 233.07 B: i mean i i focussed pretty well on my studies but not completely and that's not to say i certainly wouldn't change on all the other things i was focussing on non-study related but 

222.68 223.43 A: (( but [noise] um )) 

227.90 228.90 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

232.05 235.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

233.29 236.66 B: i there are definitely cases where i 

237.03 243.61 B: should've done the whole oh the more you put into it the more you get out i wished i'd put into it a little bit more now [laughter] 

241.81 244.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

244.71 246.99 A: [noise] but er er yeah i mean 

247.53 250.72 A: that [noise] that's something that i don't know how much that [noise] 

251.62 253.51 A: is something that i i could ch- [noise] 

254.17 257.02 A: just change like that [noise] anyway i mean [noise] 

257.06 258.00 A: (( [sigh] plus )) 

258.17 263.89 A: i don't know i think [noise] probably the biggest thing [noise] it would be like i mean it's 

264.62 274.54 A: [lipsmack] i don't know i guess i'm just going to talk the question one [noise] more time [laughter] because [noise] i mean wh- [noise] what am i supposed [noise] to do like go back [noise] and and not [noise] not ever have [noise] met my ex or 

267.41 268.73 B: [laughter] 

274.39 275.50 B: right 

274.51 282.15 A: you know done been more accepting of her or or whatever i mean [lipsmack] i if things didn't work out in that [noise] that 

282.65 290.07 A: [noise] the way things are and [noise] you know it it it's not easy but it doesn't 

290.45 295.47 A: [noise] i don't i don't think that it's bad that things happen [noise] that way i think there are like 

295.76 303.71 A: [noise] there [noise] are difficult things [noise] because of that but i don't think it's like well now [laughter] now it's like that was your big chance 

303.76 304.98 B: yeah 

304.42 309.15 A: kind of thing although in a way that's kind of true [noise] but only kind of [noise] 

308.45 309.84 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

309.57 313.71 A: (( [noise] um [noise] [lipsmack] but yeah )) 

314.24 318.63 B: yeah i find um the time the only times where i find myself saying it 

318.78 320.85 B: you know dam i wish i hadn't 

319.75 320.70 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

321.46 332.78 B: i wish i'd never met this person or you know it's really just in those those times usually hopefully [laughter] those short times of when you're just really 

324.66 325.22 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

325.70 328.65 A: (( right )) 

333.11 335.58 B: in the midst of being really upset about something 

335.49 337.06 A: right 

335.78 341.12 B: and as soon as you get any kind of distance in perspective from it 

341.48 352.81 B: not even the kind of perspective necessarily that makes you say oh i see the good things that came out of such and such [laughter] [sigh] just the perspective just the distance of well you know i don't any longer feel like 

350.39 351.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

352.71 357.49 B: the world is hell [laughter] then then you start realizing you know that 

353.78 354.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

357.69 363.03 B: [sigh] n- having it not have happened wasn't isn't what i wanted 

363.31 368.55 B: so it just takes it doesn't take usually it doesn't take too long to get that perspective again of 

368.31 370.81 A: (( right )) 

368.77 370.29 B: there's no point in 

370.76 374.17 B: regretting it wishing it didn't happen because 

372.88 379.60 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah depending [noise] depending on the the size and scope of the um [lipsmack] 

379.89 381.59 A: [noise] ramification [noise] 

382.39 383.32 B: mhm 

382.58 384.65 A: you know [noise] i mean [noise] i think [noise] 

384.92 389.40 A: sometimes things can can explode to a degree [noise] where 

390.21 392.26 A: [noise] where it ch- it ch- [noise] it 

392.71 394.41 A: [noise] it really changes 

394.49 396.96 A: (( a lot [noise] of things for you )) 

397.34 398.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

398.21 399.14 A: um 

399.69 407.74 A: [noise] i'm certain [noise] that i couldn't [noise] give [laughter] an example on the probably remaining thirty minutes those thirty seconds that we have but [sigh] [cough] 

405.14 406.11 B: [laughter] 

407.91 411.81 A: but that's where i am now like a small mistake 

411.83 415.98 A: huge consequences and and due to [lipsmack] 

413.15 414.62 B: [laughter] yeah 

416.69 417.95 A: things that are 

418.55 421.43 A: [sigh] largely beyond my control so 

422.17 432.08 A: i mean i think i'm i'm not glad that i'm learning from this um i would much rather have learned in any other 

432.63 438.84 A: almost any other conceivable [noise] uh situation um 

439.46 442.27 A: i suppose i'm in the midst of learning my lessons anyway so 

441.96 442.85 B: [laughter] 

442.22 455.61 A: it's it's it's kind of frustrating but [lipsmack] th- the fact is that you can't time travel and i mean it's it's something i've been thinking about a lot [noise] recently 'cause 

449.97 450.92 B: yeah 

455.94 458.05 A: [noise] what i'm going through but uh 

459.35 474.25 A: you know and and it's funny i orchestrate bargains like well i would give up this this this [noise] and this things that i would would have an incredibly hard time giving up just to go back and then and then i realize [noise] that even though that's true [noise] that i would [noise] it doesn't matter it doesn't it 

463.72 465.10 B: [laughter] 

468.98 469.80 B: yeah 

474.42 476.79 A: doesn't change anything 

475.48 476.51 B: [laughter] 

477.34 482.33 B: we're both just too pragmatic for this question [laughter] 

480.09 481.83 A: so i'm afraid so 

483.32 484.38 B: [laughter] 

483.61 488.17 A: but yeah i 

487.12 487.89 B: hm 

488.63 494.75 A: my housemate was talking with me or somebody was talking with me about time travel and and uh 

495.49 497.75 A: you know is it 

497.86 505.49 A: whenever you know there people always discuss it like it's something that's going to be invented some day [noise] and first off 

506.48 508.87 A: i mean [noise] you need more than 

509.10 513.54 A: like a bunch of wires and funny [noise] elect- electrical pulses 

513.39 526.68 A: and a and a watch [cough] or a clock to do it and and and that's even a stupid thing [noise] 'cause i do believe that it's it's impossible but i think we would have probably seen evidence of it 

513.54 514.43 B: (( [laughter] hm )) 

527.16 530.02 A: any already [noise] because [noise] 

528.63 529.43 B: yeah 

531.42 535.49 A: i think it would probably [noise] be limited to just a few seconds anyway 

535.41 536.66 B: hm why do you think that 

537.51 539.95 A: (( [cough] because [lipsmack] )) 

541.27 542.55 A: gee 

543.54 545.79 A: i don't know [laughter] 

544.69 546.69 B: [laughter] you just do [laughter] 

546.06 549.03 A: i just do and because i think 

549.24 563.77 A: it would it wouldn't it'd be a question of bending the rules i think i've a very limited understanding of time [noise] i think it'd just be a question of bending the rules and and i don't think it would be something that we could just like turn on it's head 

563.11 564.16 B: yeah 

565.42 566.60 A: (( um [noise] )) 

565.77 575.65 B: plus of course all the uh you know hollywood and books have shown us all the obvious pitfalls of being able to go back in time [laughter] and what could be done 

570.29 570.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

573.70 575.62 A: yeah 

576.29 579.82 B: and the the negative consequences of it [laughter] [noise] 

576.36 578.37 A: yeah 

579.38 581.17 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

581.95 584.79 A: it would be fun though i would 

585.25 591.00 A: i i would travel outside of my own life i would travel to i would do it more like 

591.33 595.16 A: [sigh] exotic travels and just you know go back to college 

594.97 599.89 B: [laughter] [sigh] yeah yeah i could i could see doing that 

596.24 598.01 A: (( [laughter] [cough] ))
