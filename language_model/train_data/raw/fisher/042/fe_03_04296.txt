2.66 3.54 A: (( hi )) 

3.38 4.89 B: my name's cathy 

4.34 5.45 A: i'm mark 

5.05 6.07 B: hi mark 

5.72 6.88 A: (( how ya doing )) 

6.38 7.77 B: good how are you doing 

7.37 8.86 A: (( all right )) 

8.27 9.47 B: (( good )) 

9.62 10.95 A: now let's see 

11.20 13.17 A: ah would you like to go first [mn] all 

12.58 14.18 B: (( ah sure )) 

13.85 15.04 A: right 

14.48 21.00 B: time travel [sigh] i think that i would go back to when i graduated from college 

20.67 21.67 A: mhm 

21.04 33.58 B: 'cause i just looking back i made some decisions that even at the time i knew were not the best thing for me but i kinda like let my heart rule me instead of my head 

33.63 43.92 B: and you know it's one thing when you kinda think about hindsight and all the decision you make but in this case i knew when i made the decision it wasn't the right one but did it anyway 

43.54 45.40 A: mhm 

44.16 58.56 B: um i had the opportunity to come back home and and start a job and you know stay at my family's house and save up some money but i was dating someone at the time who we had had some rocky problems at that point anyway 

58.56 68.86 B: and he had pretty much given me the option of well you know if you leave you know that's it 'cause i don't believe in long distance relationships but if you stay then we can you know continue the relationship 

68.88 80.68 B: and i should have just thought well you know what you've been a jerk anyway bye you know but no and i thought to myself well maybe things will get better and he'll realise what i gave up for him which was stupid 

80.70 83.44 B: [laughter] 'cause it went from bad to worse 

83.35 85.58 A: mhm [laughter] [laughter] 

84.07 86.52 B: [laughter] 

86.64 88.05 A: (( let's see )) 

89.03 96.42 B: so ah what can you think of as a time that if you could go back and change it and do something different 

96.44 98.83 A: you know you start thinking about it when when they 

99.19 101.76 A: i thought it was gonna be something a little more general than 

101.43 102.91 B: i did too 

101.78 108.29 A: what they asked [laughter] see i start thinking oh my goodness there's so there's so many points that i could go back into 

103.02 104.18 B: me too 

108.22 109.34 B: i know 

108.74 109.81 A: um 

109.85 111.86 A: let's start with the first one [laughter] 

112.00 117.74 A: ah let's see probably after i graduated from high school 

117.65 118.50 B: okay 

118.28 123.34 A: and i decided to forego going to college right then 

123.01 124.00 B: okay 

123.53 125.86 A: 'cause my parents weren't ah 

126.27 131.84 A: i have a younger brother who was eighteen months younger so he was going to graduate the very next year 

131.97 137.22 A: and in order for they couldn't afford to send both of us to college 

136.64 137.57 B: okay 

137.52 142.43 A: and i figured i would step aside and let them send him since 

142.82 149.43 A: um he was more book smart than he was more book smart than i was and but he doesn't have any commonsense 

147.00 147.91 B: (( ah )) 

149.12 151.08 B: oh okay 

150.20 155.46 A: [laughter] so he needs he needed the education more [laughter] um 

152.96 154.75 B: [laughter] 

156.12 162.09 A: but i think also you know somewhere in the back of my head i was thinking 

162.12 168.08 A: oh i'm outta school i'm outta high school now the hell with everything else [laughter] and 

166.87 168.12 B: [laughter] 

168.39 173.23 A: and ah i think it was kind of an excuse not to go to college 

172.69 173.79 B: okay 

174.17 175.31 A: but ah 

176.01 182.44 A: yeah it really if i had gone at that point ah things might have turned out a lot differently than 

182.88 183.99 A: than they have 

184.17 188.75 B: see it's funny you should say that that's kinda what helped me think about which 

188.71 203.56 B: answer i would give because i look at some of my situation now i mean it's not a bad situation but i know a lotta things that are just now starting to get back the way they should be are because i delayed 

194.60 195.40 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

203.56 210.05 B: you know what i needed to do when i graduated because i was really on a pretty good path and 

206.28 207.26 A: right 

210.51 215.05 B: had a lotta different options and opportunities but because i stayed 

215.24 229.72 B: a lot longer than i needed to 'cause i ended up staying there like another couple of years working like in a retail position you know just to be near him and i just when i look back i'm thinking how stupid what a waste of time you know 

229.57 230.58 A: yeah 

229.66 241.52 B: 'cause financially i think i would have been better off because when you well you probably experienced this when you go in the job force and they wanna know what you've done or you know what you've accomplished 

241.38 247.13 B: it it's a catch twenty two it's hard to move ahead unless you've got something to show for it 

246.64 247.86 A: exactly 

247.27 258.29 B: and if you don't have anything to show for it you can't move ahead so it's just you know it's just it's kind of a bad situation everybody i mean family friends 

258.13 264.90 B: even friends that never say anything were saying please dump this guy please 

263.48 264.77 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

265.09 268.83 B: [laughter] you know and there was even somebody else that was interested that 

268.67 274.76 B: has now gone on to be like a big cheese at one of the big companies [laughter] in america and i just 

273.36 274.12 A: (( [laughter] )) 

274.55 285.34 B: i could kick myself [laughter] because i was interested in him but no you know i just thought that i could change him and be that motivating force in his life 

275.88 277.66 A: [laughter] 

279.66 280.63 A: (( [laughter] )) 

284.78 287.66 A: oh you weren't thinking about changing him were ya 

287.11 297.18 B: yeah [laughter] the stupid thing the i think that's the worst thing you can do it took a long time to realise that but i finally got the point 

288.17 291.73 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

297.06 308.69 B: that you may be able to make some minor adjustments but nothing more than like if you think about changing clothes but you're not changing the person you know that's not happening 

306.33 307.81 A: yeah that's right 

308.20 309.65 A: (( yep it's )) 

309.02 312.85 B: and my mom had told me all my life that [sigh] you know 

312.90 323.41 B: everybody's got their different little idiosyncrasies and you have to find that person who you can kinda put up with theirs and they can put up with yours you know she said i'm not trying to sound negative i'm just being honest 

320.39 321.28 A: right 

323.29 336.29 B: don't look at somebody thinking about what they could be or should be 'cause then you're going into it all r- you know all about it wrong and i heard that but you know we all go through our phases of yeah yeah yeah i know what i'm doing 

330.31 331.31 A: right 

335.08 335.75 A: (( [laughter] )) 

335.91 339.77 A: [laughter] right so tell me anything oh i know it's 

336.45 338.10 B: [laughter] 

338.41 344.83 B: right just like you were saying about your thing with school in the back of your mind you're thinking like yes you know 

344.35 345.57 A: mhm 

345.05 346.10 B: (( man )) 

346.20 352.73 B: so have you um so do you feel like you're you've kinda come full circle that 

352.95 356.75 B: you're starting to [sigh] get did you go back to school or are you 

353.11 353.67 A: (( [cough] )) 

356.36 360.79 A: i did go back to school um as a matter of fact i graduated just last year 

360.36 362.24 B: oh congratulations 

361.64 363.29 A: thank you i ah 

363.30 368.28 A: well the funny part about it is ah it's a it's an associate degree because ah 

368.64 378.06 A: [laughter] well i'm just i'm i'm married now well at the time i [noise] when i just started school i just i got married in like maybe a year into it so 

379.12 382.41 A: so you know it's a lot different when you're 

382.42 387.59 A: when other people are involved as to what you do with your life you know 

384.57 385.49 B: yes 

386.49 389.88 B: right 'cause you have to make decisions that's gonna be good for everybody 

389.31 395.49 A: right if you i mean if i was single i could do all sorts of things and you know only i'm affected 

394.93 396.50 B: right 

395.87 396.94 A: um 

397.55 402.15 A: but ah actually the my degree is in computer game design which 

402.19 403.84 A: wasn't really 

403.99 410.36 A: it wasn't even an that wasn't even an option back in nineteen eighty eight when i graduated from high school 

409.77 412.72 B: and now that's like a major field 

412.25 420.13 A: that's right yeah and i mean now they got courses in all i mean all of a lot of different colleges just for that purpose alone and ah 

420.53 430.46 A: at when i was in high school my what i wanted to do i was kind of ah going down the law enforcement um road and ah 

430.43 440.89 A: my mother [laughter] my mother vetoed any thoughts i had about going into the drug enforcement administration she she she completely vetoed that 

437.12 438.63 B: right 

440.11 441.76 B: she was concerned 

441.18 444.90 A: yeah yah she said you can't trust the people you work with there 

444.29 446.30 B: [laughter] 

444.97 448.84 A: i said okay okay well that's okay i won't go do that then 

448.45 449.49 B: right 

449.10 450.36 A: (( and ah )) 

450.58 454.52 A: then i was t- i was in high school i was taking a law class 

454.99 461.10 A: and i really got into that and i started i started thinking that maybe i wanted to go to law school 

461.61 465.41 A: and it's so funny 'cause throughout my life 

465.86 472.47 A: people people keep saying you know what you should be a lawyer you argue everything and and it's just 

471.93 474.31 B: i've always been told that too 

474.24 480.05 A: yeah and [laughter] you start thinking then and that makes you go right back to the beginning and think 

474.44 475.36 B: [laughter] 

480.14 482.76 A: wow maybe i should have gone that way 

482.34 484.17 B: exactly 

484.44 493.60 A: and but i you know and i 'cause the option's still there i have a i have a relative who got his law degree when he was thirty eight years old 

493.20 504.65 B: yeah i mean it's it's not impossible it's not impossible 'cause i went back to school after fifteen years and i got my masters in education and i'm teaching now i've been teaching a year 

498.86 500.27 A: (( mm mhm )) 

503.40 507.13 A: hm 

504.55 511.90 B: and i love it and i mean i would have never thought that i would wanna go into teaching 'cause that wasn't what i was interested in that's not even what my undergrad was in 

511.99 512.92 B: (( but )) 

513.11 515.03 B: i love it and 

515.44 521.11 B: [sigh] i don't know something about making a difference in these children's lives and working with them a lotta times 

520.97 534.55 B: i encourage them like if they really feel something or believe something to go for it because [sigh] it it sounds like we both kinda came from the same point of having in our mind one thing but doing another thing anyway 

534.07 535.17 A: right 

534.97 537.95 B: and it's kinda hard to get back on that track 

538.09 539.83 A: that's for sure especially [noise] 

539.15 542.37 B: i mean it happens but it takes a lot longer 

542.76 547.84 B: and like you said you have other people involved too when you try to do it and it's a real struggle 

547.32 549.35 A: right i mean ah 

548.03 550.53 B: but i it it can be done 

550.66 554.05 A: and it i think it has to do a lot with finances too you know 

553.31 562.96 B: oh yeah i if it had not been for some scholarships i found out about believe me i mean [mn] ah it would have never happened never 

562.20 563.59 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

563.76 570.62 B: 'cause i was about to pull out when somebody told me about a particular scholarship and i was like whatever i'll apply for it and i got it 

570.26 571.31 A: mhm 

570.76 578.84 B: and i was like okay i do think this is somebody's way of telling me 'okay now what's your excuse [laughter] you know 

578.07 580.54 A: [laughter] yeah 

578.98 579.87 B: [laughter] 

580.78 595.66 B: wow well you know this this is a really interesting topic because you're right ah there was so many different things that i could have could have thought about 'cause i think we all have some things in our life that if we sat back you know and say ah what was i thinking 

595.70 599.89 A: [noise] and in ah i'm now that i'm thinking about it a lot of when we
