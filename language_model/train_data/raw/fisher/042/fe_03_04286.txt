123.76 128.27 B: ah a car accident i had a couple years back 

127.15 129.17 A: oh interesting 

128.62 139.23 B: i totalled my car i loved that car d- everybody still makes fun of me when they see one they're like look there's your car like oh you're funny so that's the first thing i could think of 

130.22 131.05 A: right 

136.31 137.16 A: (( oh )) 

138.11 140.39 A: is that what came to mind first 

139.77 146.50 B: yeah that was something easy i don't [laughter] i say there's gotta be worst things than that though [laughter] 

144.28 157.10 A: ye you know that's funny 'cause you just like i thought oh he just tell me he gave me a thought and it's interesting 'cause you just got me rolling right like would i change something heavy that happened to me or 

151.98 153.10 B: uh-huh 

157.26 172.17 A: you also gave me a thought would i have like tried harder to a relationship that didn't work back then or would i have picked up on a woman who i might have had something with who i walked away from that's what came to my mind that's so you just brought both those 

171.50 177.23 B: ah how 'bout walk walked away from one that you should [laughter] 

172.16 173.47 A: to my mind 

174.73 179.19 A: (( yeah oh or yeah wait a minute actually i'd be better off )) 

179.27 183.79 A: one i stayed with if i'd walked away early you know twice 

182.23 185.72 B: yeah now now now i got in some of those 

183.93 184.64 A: (( it )) 

185.13 189.56 A: you've had yeah and they're usually painful and expensive am i correct 

189.01 191.39 B: well yeah yeah 

191.37 202.71 A: i've had painful and expensive that's where you know that's that's really interesting so i guess it's like most of this stuff is like a two sided coin 'cause like like you say like my thought was 

202.84 204.81 A: you know who who 

204.65 218.40 A: could i have stayed with who was really more worthwhile than i realised maybe 'cause i was young and then you came up with a with a really good side of it what if i'd walked away from the ones that caused me so much pain and expense 

210.17 211.30 B: yeah 

217.70 221.63 B: yeah you know you sometimes you you see something 

218.35 222.79 A: hm 

222.09 223.38 B: (( that ah )) 

223.86 227.15 B: you know you see what's on the outside sometimes 

226.55 228.13 A: and you yeah 

227.49 233.14 B: and and the inside ain't that bad but the outside may be so great that you're like 

232.12 234.92 A: are you and you create this fantasy 

234.30 235.56 B: yeah 

234.94 238.96 A: yeah i've done boy have i done that and you [laughter] thinking you've done the same 

237.18 242.83 B: [laughter] yeah and and so you got a nutcase on your hands 

242.48 245.43 A: (( oh i've been there too yes you know )) 

243.85 245.21 B: [laughter] 

245.30 258.87 A: some of them are dangerous but that's real you know that's really interesting 'cause that that's one whole area your car is another area um i was lucky i was i was actually mugged outside where i worked in philadelphia 

258.24 259.20 B: uh-huh 

259.23 262.85 A: and it could have been really i was in a coma for twelve weeks and 

262.29 263.45 B: ooh shoot 

262.81 270.50 A: i coulda come just back part of me rather than most of me and it really came back with very little wrong just a couple things 

266.70 267.66 B: yeah 

270.41 278.60 A: but so you know my thought was well then why did i do that but that really that turned out pretty well just like the car you loved so much 

277.94 278.93 B: uh-huh 

278.94 280.80 A: there's another car 

280.21 281.44 B: yeah 

280.84 286.04 A: you know so that that's funny about about the things but you had me you had me going with 

286.21 290.21 A: with the relationships and women what go ahead 

288.31 299.39 B: yeah that that's the most i mean 'cause i ain't you know i don't have anything bad like i committed any crimes or anything so i can't go back and change nothing like that i can only change like 

294.34 295.22 A: right 

299.50 305.07 B: i guess like minor things i haven't i don't really have nothing yeah nothing major like 

302.06 303.52 A: nothing major 

305.16 310.05 B: i never did anything like to anybody that i really loathed or to be like 

309.43 310.95 A: you'd be guilty for 

310.07 316.16 B: you know yeah you know and not feel bad um yeah they're still living 

311.32 315.11 A: well let me ask you this question um are your parents still living

321.36 322.24 B: mhm 

324.43 335.73 A: as much as time as i might have if i had a chance he died if i had a chance to do it again i would have spent [sigh] it it wasn't easy particularly as a kid but um as an adult 

333.49 334.59 B: mhm 

335.73 340.43 A: i could have spent more time with him and i really should have you know that's 

338.58 343.71 B: yeah yeah that's starting to get now that you mentioned that i think about my grandmother 

343.50 354.32 B: a lot i had a grandmother i was close to and when she passed it was like i felt bad 'cause i was outta school when i was like i wasn't really working
