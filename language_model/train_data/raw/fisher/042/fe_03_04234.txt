51.66 52.96 A: um 

54.09 66.75 A: my mother died recently in october and um i was with her when she died but i guess i had um gone through that phase of uh denial you know 

56.33 57.43 B: uh-huh 

66.38 67.63 B: sure 

66.91 80.81 A: and i didn't um well she had been in and out of the hospital for like the last twenty years or something well not she was real active she wasn't an invalid or anything but um 

73.80 74.92 B: uh-huh 

80.77 83.09 A: um she just had [lipsmack] 

83.43 85.90 A: everything done that could be done you know like 

85.93 89.39 A: uh she had a quadruple bypass and 

88.81 90.21 B: oh gosh

94.13 95.17 B: uh-huh 

94.56 96.40 A: in the last twenty years 

96.58 103.56 A: but she was still real active and then um i just thought you know that she would come out of it even though 

103.82 106.81 A: you know i knew really that i was there 

107.75 112.08 A: because she was dying you know and uh-huh 

109.53 111.32 B: right to say goodbye 

111.83 112.89 B: right 

112.17 117.43 A: and i didn't really say goodbye um um 

118.45 119.61 A: uh 

119.91 125.44 A: i guess i just thought it was another time in the hospital and she would be out but 

125.71 134.80 B: well don't you think that's normal when when you've spent time with a loved one in a hospital and they've been sick several times or going in for repairs or 

127.44 128.88 A: yeah 

134.85 136.54 B: you always think 

136.55 139.62 B: that person's strong and they'll come out of it 

138.96 140.12 A: uh-huh 

140.24 145.15 B: you know i i i recall my own mother's death in ninety four 

145.28 149.29 B: and although she hadn't been in and out of the hospital 

149.75 153.04 B: you know we'd had little ups and downs she was eighty six 

153.30 156.61 B: but you always think well she'll snap out of it 

156.30 157.39 A: uh-huh 

157.17 161.03 B: you know this this uh and you you don't know how to say goodbye 

160.90 169.25 A: yeah i wish that i had really realized that well i knew that that was the end but um 

169.49 170.59 A: (( uh )) 

171.44 172.62 A: i guess 

172.85 175.97 A: for that point in time you know i'd 

176.81 183.37 A: just blocked it out of my mind you know it's just part of the normal grieving process is the denial you know and 

182.63 184.57 B: right of course 

183.98 185.13 A: um 

186.13 187.57 B: yeah i um 

187.95 194.72 B: if i look back on it i i had put my mother in a nursing home for the last month i couldn't care for her anymore 

194.88 199.21 B: and even as i went in to see her every day on the last day 

199.46 210.07 B: she wouldn't sit up and she just told me mary you have to get home and and get on with your life and i should have realized that that was a sign she wasn't going to 

210.36 213.28 B: make it any much longer because she 

212.48 216.36 A: she was able to tell you that oh that was good 

214.05 215.06 B: yes 

215.10 222.02 B: yeah and i didn't but i didn't pick up on it you know she just said you need to go home now and get on with your life 

221.54 222.62 A: uh-huh 

222.19 223.88 B: so i did my normal 

223.91 225.34 B: goodbye to her 

225.39 228.47 B: you know anticipating the return the next day 

228.69 233.13 B: to go visit her you know and and i got a phone call before i could get there 

233.46 235.59 B: but why didn't i see 

235.88 243.56 B: you know that she was extra depressed that day or or her words mary you need to get on with your life 

243.91 244.97 A: uh-huh 

244.49 246.61 B: why didn't i pick up on that 

246.51 252.97 A: well that's exactly where i was you know there there was a n- nurse from the hospice there 

252.53 253.51 B: uh-huh 

252.85 266.94 A: and she told me you know that i needed to uh take it more seriously that um she was near the end but you know i still didn't even pick up on that you know i guess it's just your own mind telling you you 

267.27 270.91 A: know it's your way of coping with it at that time you know 

268.33 269.07 B: well 

270.63 272.98 B: yeah it's just um yeah it's denial 

272.66 273.78 A: uh-huh 

273.29 279.88 B: i know you know we just think our moms and dads are going to be around forever we saw 'em that way as children 

279.51 280.70 A: uh-huh 

280.51 285.88 B: you know and unfortunately we can't [laughter] can't go back it time travel you would go back 

285.70 286.64 A: uh-huh 

286.02 291.71 B: you know and and tell her how much you loved her and and that you were going to be okay 

292.12 294.22 B: you know i'm sure she knows that 

293.85 294.95 A: uh-huh 

294.60 296.41 B: i'm sure she knows that 

296.46 305.72 B: i was able to to tell mom about a week or so ahead of time that you know did she understand that my sister and i would would be okay when she's gone 

306.11 308.90 B: and she had no doubts about that 

309.41 314.80 B: um and i did tell her if you need to go on i understand 

315.01 319.46 B: but i had been told to maybe try to do those things 

319.08 320.66 A: mhm 

320.04 321.10 B: um 

321.38 325.32 B: but i still didn't pick up on it it was mechanical 

326.12 333.45 B: you know i thought i had to [laughter] because somebody said you need to do this but it was it was 

327.78 328.96 A: uh-huh 

333.97 338.41 B: it was hard and i couldn't really address the topics like i should have 

339.11 343.47 B: and i wish i could go back and just have a little a little sit down talk with her 

343.12 344.39 A: sure 

344.25 345.31 B: you know i 

344.70 350.91 A: i i've worried about that a lot you know that i've really wished that i had you know 

351.18 357.22 A: been able to say goodbye but i just wasn't at that time you know [laughter] 

353.74 355.07 B: but that's tough 

356.82 360.78 B: yeah that's that's a tough thing to do because you don't want to believe it 

360.16 361.31 A: uh-huh 

360.92 365.79 B: you know you just don't want to believe it and then when it happens it you know it's just 

365.92 368.50 B: that feeling of it it's so final 

368.21 369.33 A: uh-huh 

369.33 374.38 B: you know you realize that you you know you miss hearing that tone that voice 

375.09 377.03 B: you know or that handwriting 

376.85 378.00 A: uh-huh 

377.70 381.66 B: and and you can't go back and capture that 

382.37 386.26 B: you know i i should have visited with her more about um 

386.62 388.44 B: family things 

387.86 388.91 A: uh-huh 

388.52 392.44 B: i think my sister did but she's a long way away 

392.60 393.63 B: um 

394.45 400.28 B: you know i i i just think we all maybe if if you're married with children i don't know uh 

400.44 402.36 B: just make sure your children 

403.03 406.01 B: understand you know how much you love 'em 

405.76 406.77 A: uh-huh 

407.00 414.56 B: and and um are proud of 'em and any family things that need to be discussed 

415.24 417.13 B: you know have it out in the open 

416.80 417.97 A: uh-huh 

417.28 419.33 B: so that there's no curiosity 

420.51 428.36 B: you know it would be it would be wonderful if they could give us some kind of a sign knowing that that they understand what we're thinking now 

428.08 429.13 A: uh-huh 

429.06 435.16 B: and we can't [laughter] you know we we can't get that feeling of you know did 

435.18 438.78 B: does she know what i'm going through and i'm sure you feel that too 

438.55 439.69 A: uh-huh 

439.59 442.90 B: you know does she understand that i wish i could have 

443.37 449.20 B: have said goodbye or said more things to her whatever it is you would like to have said 

449.41 450.37 B: you know 

449.53 456.43 A: you know so many times talking about time travel it sounds like something science fiction you know like um 

454.64 455.66 B: uh-huh 

456.66 457.74 A: um 

459.85 462.46 A: doesn't seem real but um 

462.72 467.37 A: every time that i've been touched with a death you know of anyone close 

467.27 474.78 A: i have been revisited like that you know not directly you know like they didn't appear it wasn't a ghost or anything but just little 

473.15 474.25 B: right 

474.68 485.02 A: signs that it was almost like a visit you know like um when my dog died when uh the last dog i had um 

479.81 481.13 B: yeah 

485.69 491.40 A: she used to always sit in the wicker chair in the bedroom and um 

488.99 490.01 B: uh-huh 

492.04 495.33 A: the night after she died 

495.95 501.17 A: i could hear the wicker chair screeching around you know like she was trying to get comfortable and all you know 

498.85 499.96 B: right 

500.56 502.22 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

501.54 508.72 A: and it doesn't do that on its own you know like with temperature change or anything you know you have to be sitting in and moving around you know 

507.50 508.73 B: right 

508.87 511.04 A: and then um 

511.43 516.55 A: there've been several things that have come up like that you know since my mother died um 

516.78 521.79 A: the sunday uh in church um 

522.38 524.86 A: the anthem was steal away 

524.51 525.48 B: uh-huh 

525.07 528.44 A: and my mother was up here in uh 

528.53 536.68 A: uh ninety one and i was going through some of her um papers the other day well sunday after church 

529.90 530.81 B: uh-huh 

536.12 537.04 B: uh-huh 

536.85 550.04 A: and the choir played steal away this past sunday and i was going through some of her papers looking for some insurance um um policies and um 

539.55 540.97 B: oh really 

541.42 542.81 B: oh my gosh 

547.74 548.76 B: uh-huh 

550.05 555.44 A: i came home from church after they sang that anthem steal away and then um 

555.72 568.10 A: i read the paper and had lunch and then i was going through all of her papers and all and she had saved the program from june of ninety one when she was up here then 

567.57 568.53 B: uh-huh 

568.04 571.93 A: and the anthem that sunday was steal away i 

571.03 573.62 B: well see i think those are little signs

573.76 580.62 B: you know my sister had two clocks stop at exactly within five seconds of the time that mom died 

580.16 581.50 A: oh really 

580.62 592.20 B: and she was in california and mom was here with me in texas [sigh] so those little things i just truly believe in those i it's got to be little signs that they're trying to get through to us 

591.86 593.00 A: uh-huh 

592.62 593.76 B: you know 

593.91 598.61 B: to make it more maybe more peaceful or accepting more of it
