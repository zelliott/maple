1.84 3.89 B: hi ah this is han 

4.56 5.49 A: hi 

4.66 7.51 B: my name is han hi how are you 

7.39 9.25 A: um pretty good [laughter] 

9.01 17.94 B: [laughter] ah sorry ah what's ah like my my my cellphone wasn't that clear but like the topic was ah to talk about time travel was it 

17.31 21.22 A: ah i i think if you can go back in time and change something you did 

21.25 22.34 A: um 

21.48 22.48 B: okay 

22.71 25.31 A: you know would what would you do [laughter] 

24.88 31.58 B: oh i see okay gotcha 'cause like the ah the ah recorded message wasn't wasn't that great so 

26.48 27.86 A: ah it's like 

30.46 37.40 A: right it i i was thinking it was talking about travel and it sounds like if you could do something again 

34.93 36.10 B: (( oh okay )) 

37.21 38.54 B: oh i see 

38.15 41.86 A: the do you got something you wanna talk about you want me to go first or 

41.05 46.90 B: [laughter] ah w- w- do you wanna go first oh ah so i have time to think about it [laughter] for a while 

46.20 55.81 A: okay well i mean i was just thinking of this today if i can go back in time i would probably go back to when i graduated from high school 

55.81 65.95 A: ah i had planned to join in the navy but i think i was um kind of influenced by some family members you know like my parents and um 

65.98 76.53 A: i i think primarily my mom didn't want me to go obviously you know her her little boy going off to um you know the military for some reason and ah you know they were telling me oh 

76.91 82.36 A: they they make it sound like it's better than it is and you know they're they're gonna 

83.13 89.50 A: tell you all the fun you're gonna have and they're just basically not gonna give you anything like they tell ya you know you're 

89.80 91.38 A: you know 'cause i had an offer 

91.55 106.17 A: ah you know i was going into computer science and they told me more than likely i might ah be in one of the naval stations like you know bahamas or somewhere like or maybe not necessarily bahamas but in one of the nicer areas like that [sigh] 

106.70 109.70 A: and i thought that would have been wonderful um 

108.98 110.84 B: mhm 

110.08 120.09 A: but you know i did i did get involved with ah computer science and then you know made a good living but i always look back and think 

120.22 129.36 A: you know what what would life had been like if i would have joined the you know the navy and not necessary made a career out of it but at least um 

128.66 130.54 B: right wow 

129.72 136.35 A: yeah and and i kinda regret it i kind of always look back um i ended up getting married early 

136.41 141.12 A: having a family and everything and you know life was a little rough at first i 

141.16 145.08 A: you know i always thought i would have you know that could have happened also in the navy but [sigh] 

145.49 151.26 A: i i really you know things things probably would have been a lot different if i went the other direction [laughter] 

151.19 152.43 B: right 

151.81 157.07 A: so yeah now i have a son that's about to graduate and he's [sigh] talking about air force 

157.13 159.60 A: but then now he's kinda getting cold feet [sigh] 

159.74 174.73 A: and you know i've i've gotta give him some advice and i'm thinking you know that's basically what i'm gonna tell him if you know if i could do it all over again [sigh] i would at least give it a try i mean if you if you go to university for four years what's the difference if you're in the navy or air force 

169.54 170.61 B: right 

174.79 176.88 A: you're gonna be away from home [laughter] 

176.72 177.98 B: mhm 

177.38 182.97 A: at at least ah the service ah you're getting a lot of education and training 

182.99 189.32 A: and you know you you don't have to worry about paying rent [laughter] you know all sorts of stuff 

187.82 190.96 B: that's right right yeah 

190.00 196.70 A: so so anyway i think that's that's basically what i would do and you know i don't know if you had time to think of your [laughter] experience 

196.29 198.86 B: oh yeah well yeah actually like um 

199.12 201.06 B: (( i i would say like my )) 

201.41 213.94 B: ah mine's ah is ah somewhat similar to yours ah basically i think if i were to to ah time travel i'd probably want to do something different ah 

214.34 227.19 B: in in high school and in college basically like i i think ever since i ah ever since junior high school like my my my focus has been getting a good education ah 

227.21 231.10 B: getting like getting ah a practical um 

231.91 236.80 B: degree and get a good job and have a stable income ah 

237.19 240.50 B: but but [cough] not like 

240.75 251.33 B: now that i think about it it it you know is it really worth it you know like i mean i i've known friends that like pursue their passions and and just like you know go off doing doing what they really enjoy 

251.44 263.88 B: ah pursuing degrees in architecture you know arts um history politics you know like in high school i was quite interested in politics and history but um 

264.01 264.64 B: (( [cough] )) 

264.85 276.27 B: but like you know it it it it just didn't make too much sense like in terms of like making money to ah to major to have a some a major like that so 

276.65 286.66 B: you know so i i went to ah engineering school got a engineering degree and now i'm i'm work ah actually i'm pro running too that's a fulltime job 

286.76 287.89 B: um 

288.16 294.82 B: now that i look back it's ah well ah i mean obviously i can still i can still like you know like 

294.87 303.05 B: change what i'm doing now ah i'm not married and and i still have like some degree of freedom but um if i were to 

303.18 306.29 B: like have a completely 

306.40 312.78 B: ah different path such as like you know say i don't know teaching history in universities 

312.81 322.04 B: something that i might enjoy like it probably is a little too late because you know i don't have a history undergraduate degree and therefore i can't go to s- ah 

322.12 326.64 B: i don't know probably it's harder to to switch at this time um 

325.70 336.04 A: um maybe not you know [laughter] it i i think the biggest thing is having the degree that that definitely will ah will help you but you know it's it may not be ah 

328.36 329.58 B: yeah 

336.15 343.71 A: you know may not be too late i i know of i've seen teachers teaching things that they had you know they had degrees in 

337.88 339.26 B: right 

343.78 353.47 A: you know horticulture and they were they were teaching things you might have to you know brush yup on some things but ah you know maybe you're not too late 

353.33 354.94 B: right that's true 

353.90 362.13 A: and the the the big plus is you just said you didn't have ah you know you're not married or having children yet that that makes a big difference 

361.99 363.37 B: wow yeah 

362.59 371.96 A: [laughter] i i got married early and had a child and and then you're you're very limited you know it it it makes a difference um 

369.34 370.75 B: right 

371.46 372.61 B: that's true 

372.28 384.54 A: you gotta make different decisions because you know you gotta consider the family so ah well well anyway good luck to your your plans or future if you decide to ah you know change your path [laughter] 

384.52 386.38 B: [laughter] thanks 

385.18 390.63 A: sounds sounds like ah you know there you gotta few things going for you there [laughter] in 

389.93 391.40 B: (( yes ah )) 

391.68 392.99 A: you know desire 

391.98 393.07 B: (( ah )) 

393.08 393.88 B: sorry 

393.87 401.06 A: no you got that desire and um and you know the fact that you're not tied down that that makes a big difference these days 

401.01 406.05 B: yeah yeah definitely like i ah ah yeah ah i agree like what 

406.21 414.73 B: like just just i mean like ah [sigh] when when i ah like when when we said sometimes like when we ah go through ah group outings with my ah 

414.67 423.69 B: managers and coworkers like those that are married just like are complaining about well not complaining but like you know like their behavior's just like a lot different because 

423.52 438.35 B: like my boss who makes you know like a lot more money than me and the they're like you can see that like they're just ah very ah cautious in spending and and and [cough] you know stuff like that [mn] [noise] 

437.83 443.17 A: definitely yeah your your your money's habits are different when you're married than ah 

442.97 447.27 B: (( [noise] right right )) 

443.49 444.96 A: when you're single or 

445.04 449.23 A: you know don't have as much responsibility or burden on yourself ah 

449.24 451.39 A: it makes a big difference 

450.77 458.51 B: [noise] right but the thing is um [cough] if you don't ah i guess i don't know like 

458.96 470.60 B: [sigh] it's hard to say because like it's hard en- well it it's almost impossible to know like what you really want like especially like in high school like if i were to like now that i think about it if i were 

470.59 478.92 B: like myself in high school all over again like w- would i have the you know like resolution and certainty that i ah 

478.82 486.66 B: you know history is definitely like this is the path i should take you know maybe if i go down that path and find out like hey you know history is not really you 

486.90 488.74 B: know all that great and stuff 

489.05 490.34 A: well that's true 

490.22 494.63 A: um you know and if you're young enough though you can you can take a gamble and ah 

494.48 506.50 A: and still change course but but yeah it is always scary you're you're like well i've gotta do this and um the computer business has been fine um you know i may need to change some of that but ah 

503.90 504.59 B: (( great )) 

507.11 512.51 A: it's you know it's changing constantly you know you gotta keep up with it but but i think ah 

512.92 525.50 A: i think i if there there's a lot of other things now looking back i think i coulda done it might have been nicer ah less stressful [laughter] but ah you know it's it's it's not a bad industry 

520.79 521.87 B: right 

525.46 527.23 B: (( right right )) 

525.61 529.06 A: so there there are lot lot better runs out there [laughter] 

529.16 532.45 B: yeah [cough] that's true and also um 

532.77 534.40 B: and also like um 

534.44 538.25 B: i i don't know like the this just like rem- [noise] of like another topic who 

538.64 542.08 B: oh shoot ah ah sorry um hello 

542.10 543.23 A: yeah i'm here ah 

542.93 551.06 B: oh okay sorry like an another person's calling me and [noise] like they're recording said something about like no call waiting or something like that 

550.45 551.65 A: okay 

551.56 554.53 B: you know [laughter] ah anyways um 

554.63 556.16 B: yeah ah 

557.35 558.75 B: (( what i was gonna say )) 

559.96 561.32 B: yeah and and and 

561.40 564.06 B: [noise] thing another thing was um 

564.42 565.89 B: i ah 

566.21 574.21 B: like i think i [sigh] like as as a as like when i was in college or high school i was like too 

574.42 584.70 B: like rigid in terms of like thinking that only ah a s- like engineering degrees and like you know a a few other majors can 

584.96 587.58 B: like you know leap to a good career 

587.71 597.48 B: but that's like definitely not true after i you know like come out of school and ah and you know like been working for like almost a year and see that like a lot of people with 

597.50 599.95 B: you know like totally irrelevant degrees
