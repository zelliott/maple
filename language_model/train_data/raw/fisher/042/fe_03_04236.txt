54.30 55.27 A: yeah 

61.54 66.26 B: kinda went a little crazy with drinking and running around and stuff i mean it was just 

66.50 71.55 B: a totally different situation for both of us [laughter] i mean it 

69.07 70.04 A: yeah 

72.60 73.44 B: was 

74.13 76.27 B: [sigh] have you ever went through a divorce

84.47 87.03 A: and so but and he has a rough time with it 

86.46 90.32 B: oh yeah yeah i mean it's it's hard i mean [noise] 

91.31 98.88 B: the kids really i mean i'm glad your fiance is enough to think of the child you know [laughter]

102.31 103.03 A: [laughter]

105.26 106.06 B: (( [laughter] )) 

106.12 112.78 A: and i know that he would probably do the same thing he probably would have never got married [noise] if he could go back [laughter] 

110.98 124.12 B: yeah [laughter] well i guess every situ- uh there is two sides to every story but i mean [sigh] i mean i don't sometimes i wonder even why i even got a divorce to tell you the truth i mean it was just 

116.23 117.87 A: yeah you could probably 

117.94 119.43 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

121.03 121.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

125.17 128.85 B: i don't know [laughter] [sigh] it's really hard to explain 

126.26 127.14 A: [laughter] 

128.99 129.69 B: (( but )) 

130.53 137.01 A: yeah i [sigh] i i think i would go back and change the way i grew up [noise] [laughter] the things i did in school 

135.10 136.35 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

136.53 144.16 B: uh yeah [laughter] [sigh] i think that would be a start yeah i took it and [sigh] sat and think about the regrets that it you know 

137.08 138.59 A: [laughter] 

145.20 147.76 B: how hard i made it for my mum and dad too 

147.02 148.66 A: right yeah that's how i was 

147.80 148.91 B: i mean 

149.24 151.55 B: [sigh] you never realize that until you're 

151.85 159.71 B: older and can't change it but [sigh] i mean like my daughter tells me well we've got to live for the future now so [laughter] 

153.24 154.71 A: right [laughter] 

158.65 160.65 A: yeah that's what my mum says 

161.02 162.01 B: forget 

161.06 163.99 A: you can't go back and change things that you've already done 

163.65 176.46 B: yeah just say you're sorry and you know mean it and go on [laughter] [laughter] right but it's still hard to forget some of the mistakes you made [laughter] [sigh] i mean the other people might forgive you but 

167.37 169.08 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

172.85 173.83 A: oh yeah 

176.56 180.10 B: you have a hard time forgiving yourself sometimes [laughter] 

178.81 179.71 A: right 

181.15 184.94 B: just try to keep so the kids don't make the same ones 

184.33 185.63 A: right 

185.28 190.94 B: but they don't listen to you [laughter] [laughter] they got to make their own 

187.90 189.34 A: [laughter] 

190.92 196.08 A: oh yeah that's what my mum said she always told me not to do things and now i wish i would have listened 

195.35 205.60 B: yeah well it's just like i told my daughter there's three stages first mum and dad know everything and then they don't know anything and then hey maybe they did [laughter] i 

197.19 197.75 A: (( [cough] )) 

205.97 210.48 B: mean it's just one thing after another but [sigh] yeah 

208.51 209.58 A: right 

210.67 217.63 B: school would be a lot i mean right there was the start i if i wouldn't have quit school i'd you know 

214.00 215.39 A: right [laughter] 

216.12 216.90 A: uh 

218.91 220.08 B: had more 

221.14 222.61 B: [lipsmack] i don't know 

222.69 229.61 B: self confidence and everything in s- while i was in school i'm sure that [sigh] everything would have been different today 

223.75 224.64 A: yeah 

229.17 230.46 A: right 

230.06 231.49 B: [sigh] i mean the whole [sigh] 

232.28 233.41 B: (( yard )) 

232.40 233.58 A: want a yummy 

234.54 235.80 B: that would have been 

237.01 239.58 A: that would have been the start for me [laughter] 

237.94 242.21 B: [noise] yeah that would have been for me too i think i mean 

243.62 247.86 B: [sigh] when i started messing around uh goofing off in school that's 

248.07 252.10 B: when i started goofing off in other places [laughter] [mn] 

251.34 253.41 A: yeah that's how i was too [laughter] 

252.71 255.21 B: i mean that's where it started so 

258.62 262.76 B: [noise] i don't know i really don't know what else to say [laughter] 

261.06 264.49 A: i think yeah i think that's the only thing i would change too i 

264.58 266.78 A: don't think i would do anything else different 

266.63 268.04 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

270.02 271.45 B: but i i mean if 

272.21 280.45 B: would have stayed in school everything probably would have been different [laughter] [laughter] wouldn't have had to change it [laughter] or think about it [laughter] [sigh] but 

274.95 278.17 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

278.72 279.94 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

282.21 283.63 B: (( [sigh] i don't know this [noise] )) 

287.70 290.90 A: i'd have no i don't even know what else to say [laughter] 

290.18 299.74 B: i i don't either [laughter] [sigh] yeah [laughter] i well ten minutes seems awful long when you don't know what [laughter] 

290.97 293.02 A: it was a hard topic [laughter] 

297.34 299.39 A: right [laughter] 

299.79 301.05 B: i mean it's 

301.37 303.39 B: just kind of weird here

303.52 304.45 B: (( [laughter] )) 

307.07 310.18 A: i don't think there would be anything else i would change unless uh 

311.27 312.89 A: (( i think i would )) 

312.66 317.11 B: well i mean there's probably a lot of things i'd like to change but i mean it 

315.61 318.30 A: right now but i wouldn't go back and change 'em 

317.65 330.19 B: no i wouldn't go back and change 'em but i mean if you would have stayed like i said if i would have stayed in school i probably wouldn't have had all these other changes [laughter] [sigh] i wouldn't have got married i wouldn't have had kids 

318.73 319.51 A: [laughter] 

325.76 328.23 A: [laughter] [noise] [laughter]
