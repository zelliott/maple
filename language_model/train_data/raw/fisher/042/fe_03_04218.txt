1.68 3.71 B: (( hi this is kim from michigan )) 

4.66 8.58 A: hello hi it's it's it's brett from new york how are you 

5.48 6.17 B: hi 

6.25 6.91 B: hi 

8.15 10.07 B: good how are you doing [laughter] 

9.20 11.21 A: all right what's up [noise] [noise] 

10.62 13.79 B: uh not much i guess we're ready to talk about the topic or 

13.69 15.31 A: yeah [noise] okay 

14.96 16.87 B: (( uh do you want to go first or me )) 

16.19 17.72 A: no you can go first 

17.01 26.49 B: [laughter] it's always me okay [cough] i guess wha- the one thing that i would change about the past is um when i got out of high school i went straight into college at university of michigan 

19.26 20.20 A: yeah 

26.29 27.39 A: yeah 

26.78 32.24 B: and when you do that a lot of times you think you know what you want to do for the rest of your life but you don't 

31.99 33.15 A: mhm 

32.43 40.91 B: and i landed up getting a liberal arts degree and it was in spanish because i loved you know speaking another language and political science international studies 

38.46 39.39 A: yeah 

40.87 42.11 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

41.33 48.28 B: [cough] but um at that time you're thinking about what you like to do but really is there is market for that and i wasn't really um 

48.37 49.35 B: you know 

49.44 54.99 B: targeting the you know a market for that as well like will they need me how hard will it be to find a job 

55.21 62.35 B: and um the most i could get with that liberal arts degree was uh you know were different uh customer service jobs 

62.44 65.11 B: and maybe i'd have the opportunity to speak spanish 

62.66 63.60 A: mhm 

65.63 71.89 B: and um so that's probably the biggest mistake i did was um not checking to see [cough] 

65.70 66.50 A: oh 

71.75 83.22 B: even though the school was telling me oh there'll be plenty of jobs you know with international trade or you know opening up and um [lipsmack] you know with mexico and that that was like you know back in the early nineties 

83.86 87.10 B: [lipsmack] and i said oh well that'll be you know that'll be great and um 

87.24 101.94 B: but uh i landed up working for g._m. for a coupla years media but all i could do were these awful customer service jobs and all these different hours so i think i made a big mistake and if i had to do over i would go back for some kind of trades or skill or 

102.02 109.20 B: something uh you know like a um uh [mn] like a vet tech 'cause i love animals or i'd go into something with computers and web design 

109.50 110.47 A: yeah 

109.88 115.23 B: more technical because i like that i've found that out now but that's you know ten years later 

111.32 112.23 A: (( [cough] )) 

115.28 116.83 A: right right 

116.41 127.07 B: so that's my probably my biggest thing is when you jump uh jump from uh school into you know from high school into college you really you really don't know who you are at seventeen or what you want to do 

123.16 124.44 A: right 

126.00 126.86 A: yeah 

127.46 142.25 A: well i guess the thing i'd ch- i would change is uh well a lot of things i'd change and everything and first thing i'd change is a lot of the people i i uh i associated with when i was younger and everything they seem to be coming back to haunt me when i'm you know as i'm getting older now and everything you know 

142.32 151.18 A: uh a lot of people i thought were you know were good people and everything ended up being you know a lot of people were just it's not worth talking i spent a lot of time with you know with 

151.10 164.93 A: with people that just just weren't my level and it you know appeased a lot of people and everything trying to get through life and and then just people coming back to me you know they think they're my friends and everything and they're not my friends they're not they ne- never were my friends you know and that's 

162.23 162.93 B: (( mhm mm )) 

163.81 165.31 B: right right 

164.70 171.40 A: and that's you know and now i'm associated with them and as i get older i'm responsible for the people i hung with when i was younger and everything you know 

171.53 176.09 A: [cough] and i just want 'em out i want 'em away from me you know [laughter] i want 'em 

174.44 177.17 B: right and it's still coming back still in your life 

176.13 183.44 A: yeah yeah it's like it's like they come back to haunt me everywhere everywhere i go and everything everywhere i turn there's something else and it's funny now i've gotten um 

183.46 190.51 A: you know i've gotten you know a big bigger position in life and everything i'm uh part owner of a cellular company and part amongst a couple of other things that i do you know 

190.52 197.67 A: now i'm i'm in charge of uh you know hiring and firing people and it's like this is one small example like for for [mn] [noise] some people who 

197.57 210.30 A: who like you know i never you know i i was your friend when i was when i you know when i was hanging out with you you know in in the marketing room and stuff like that now you come back to me and now now now you got hired for a job and uh and now you're under me now and everything 

210.06 214.77 A: and that you know so so so like for instance one there's one person like like that they've hired 

214.62 229.48 A: they hired and i i begged them not to hire them because i knew knew that that person from years ago and i said it's going to be a failure i know it tell you right now it's going to be failure right now [mn] and she's hanging around the place and it's a failure and i can't i'm grinding my teeth in the corner and there's nothing i can do about it you know

388.36 392.87 A: right right he he absolutely will be working it out in life and everything 

392.26 405.02 B: but i just be- i believe like you know sometimes when you meet certain people there was a reason for meeting them or you know you got involved in certain things it was it was just supposed to happen [cough] you know like some of the worst things in life can turn out to really shape you and change you 

405.12 410.06 B: to a stronger person not that it's really exciting to go through that but 

406.74 407.82 A: (( yeah you know )) 

409.80 413.75 A: [noise] i hope doesn't take this seriously uh 

413.93 422.21 A: it's just you know you keep thinking it's going to work you know it's like why's it taking so long you know why for things to work out you know why you know it's like 

420.38 421.28 B: right 

422.10 422.86 A: you know 

422.69 430.03 A: why don't get me wrong and everything it's not like like i'm on a downer you know the whole time i'm not i've i've had a pretty i've had a lot of good things in life and everything it just feels like 

429.85 444.62 A: i could be so much further if i hadn't listened to bad advice throughout my life to people who looked good and everything and i just had you know i was just given bad directions and everything in life and everything i mean there there are people you know who who are you 

433.80 434.59 B: right 

434.70 435.65 B: right 

444.52 450.94 A: know born into money you know fi- find their love when they're fifteen and everything you know spend the rest of their life you know when they're fifteen and all that 

450.79 459.55 A: okay but still that doesn't mean just 'cause you found it doesn't mean you can't you know you you ca- you can still be led down the wrong road no matter what you know 

453.79 454.35 B: (( mm )) 

459.18 460.16 B: right 

459.54 462.31 A: because there's right and wrong but what happened is 

462.21 473.11 A: the world has interpreted uh the word right and wrong into into the wrong dictionary but every every foreigner that's been left in let let into this country has their own interpretation of the language okay 

472.95 481.11 A: no no offence to them i i don't have a problem with them co- with them being here as long as they do the right thing okay i don't want i don't want that to sound like a racial slur or anything you know 

480.30 482.18 B: (( mhm )) 

481.09 494.86 A: but um you know people you know people are taught certain things in school but you but you're taught by the views of what the teacher teaches you okay and this is what the teacher learned when he was young maybe and maybe just maybe he's stuck in the old ways and he's spreading the old ways 

494.69 501.82 A: to to the new generation okay where whereas the world is just not like that anymore okay it's constant it's constantly changing you know 

495.72 496.95 B: (( [cough] right )) 

501.58 515.74 A: it's constantly changing but you were put in that classroom and you were put in that room [cough] with that particular teacher okay and you ha- and maybe you admired him you had to listen to him okay because he was giving you the grade at the end okay 

515.54 519.02 A: so you had to do the right thing by him okay 

518.58 519.52 B: right 

519.14 531.53 A: you got you got indoctrinated you got mental indoctrinated okay okay now now that's how you had to lead your life and this guy may just may not be teaching the right thing okay but you have no choice okay 

530.18 531.94 B: right right right 

532.08 541.57 A: so if i could change anything i i wish that i could just have gotten the right direction in life and had had consistently the right direction in life 

534.31 535.23 B: mhm 

541.69 550.03 A: and [sigh] when i made my choices if ju- people would just leave me let me live my life my way and if you had to pick out something to say 

547.54 548.28 B: (( mm )) 

550.15 563.79 A: fine say it okay but you live your life your way let me and don't and don't indoctrinate your views on other people 'cause you have no right to do that and you know i used to think oh i should appease the whole world and let and let them let them you know 

557.90 558.92 B: mhm 

563.62 572.17 A: this this person's wrong but sit there grin and bear it and everything and let and let your life be affected by this person because 'cause that's that's a symbol of faith and you should 

569.20 570.44 B: (( right but )) 

570.71 577.14 B: see that's not that's the whole thing about life it's a learning process do you know what i mean what you know now you wish you knew then we all do 

577.04 586.31 A: yeah that's true but you know the funny thing about it is what frustrates me more than anything is that how can people not matter what i'm i'm forty i just turned forty okay and how could 

584.49 586.47 B: hm mhm yeah i'm thirty three 

586.32 588.82 A: okay [laughter] so how could people 

589.32 599.95 A: i see people doing the same stupid things okay [laughter] that they that that i saw people making mistakes thirty years ago the same people the same people that reappear in my 

596.69 597.70 B: mhm
