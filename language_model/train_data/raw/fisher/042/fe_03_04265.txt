12.66 14.12 B: [noise] time travel 

14.42 17.57 A: yes i think there was a choice of two topics 

16.92 19.22 B: mhm no i only got one [sigh]

28.49 30.59 B: [sigh] uh [sigh] 

31.13 38.26 B: i don't know i'm reading slaughterhouse five with my students and it's about somebody [noise] who goes back and forth in time in his mind 

38.58 42.01 B: [noise] so i guess we do that [noise] [sigh] but 

41.11 43.54 A: that's how yeah i can see that 

43.68 46.90 A: i can see in your mind doing it you think physically though or no 

47.03 51.01 A: like there's another like realm almost like a warp 

47.18 47.82 B: (( mm )) 

51.05 54.64 B: there might be i mean i guess that's why we have deja vu 

54.80 55.40 B: (( [sigh] )) 

55.57 59.02 B: you know when we [noise] go places we think we've been before 

59.41 60.58 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

59.92 65.34 B: [noise] but i don't know we're supposed to talk about where we'd want to go if we could in the past [noise] 

66.02 67.51 A: (( where would you want to go )) 

66.52 67.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

68.18 77.36 B: um [sigh] [noise] i guess i would go back to nineteen eighty [noise] when i was studying writing out at u. s. c. i was working on a screen play 

78.64 81.31 B: (( because [noise] [lipsmack] uh )) 

78.99 79.74 A: think oh 

81.98 88.67 B: i was working in the summer and then i came back here and i met somebody [noise] i thought i was going to marry and it never worked out [sigh] 

89.01 92.36 B: and i never finished my s- my writing 

92.85 94.28 A: really 

94.17 95.32 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

95.79 98.07 A: and how long ago was that nineteen eighty 

97.64 98.78 B: mhm 

99.11 100.39 A: oh wow 

99.85 108.99 B: [noise] [lipsmack] yeah and i regret it to this day because more [noise] that anything i wanted to write [noise] and you know i go to movies and things and i think i could have written that 

100.68 101.62 A: um 

110.53 112.26 A: well what about now though [lipsmack] 

112.18 114.92 B: [noise] [lipsmack] now i don't have the money and i'm [noise] 

115.08 120.56 B: i'm so into my career and [sigh] you know teaching takes up all my time [noise] 

120.90 122.18 A: (( oh i see )) 

122.66 123.64 A: um 

122.67 124.45 B: [sigh] so what about you 

124.36 128.02 A: if i were to go back in time i would probably i'd 

128.09 134.42 A: i would probably want to go all the way back and just start complete- like mother's womb kind of back 

134.03 135.54 B: [sigh] wow 

134.43 138.20 A: and just start differently every single little thing 

138.68 142.50 A: 'cause my problems started [laughter] when i was really young [sigh] 

142.65 148.27 A: so i would want to definitely start as far back as i could when everything was innocence you know 

148.18 152.60 B: but are those things you could have changed you could have done differently 

152.80 162.74 A: [noise] [lipsmack] i think so i think so i think uh you know even even as a young child you still have uh your perceptions can so easily be [noise] um 

163.18 164.34 A: thwarted 

164.40 173.92 A: towards different things and [sigh] i think that i don't know i just think it it would be if i could do it again if i could start that young and have all the impressions that i had received 

173.81 180.74 A: [sigh] um [lipsmack] as a child ref- come to me in a different way [noise] that things would have ended up differently 

180.83 182.10 B: but you'd still 

181.12 183.59 A: i would have perceived them differently [noise] 

183.66 187.23 B: i don't know 'cause you'd still see them from a child's view 

188.21 189.11 B: right 

188.25 199.28 A: yeah well yeah but [noise] i don't know when i was [mn] even as i when i was very young i started to uh [sigh] you know you you're given choices when you're 

199.42 205.07 A: a you know as young as you can be of what you want to eat or what flavors you like better [sigh] 

205.22 219.76 A: and i think that if i was to do it all over again that maybe it would be different it's a chance that i would take obviously it well it's not definite that it would be different of course it i like chocolate i'd still pick the chocolate but [sigh] there's always that chance that it can go a different way 

216.68 218.23 B: mhm 

221.80 223.55 A: (( so that's what i would want to do )) 

221.81 228.24 B: but does that mean you have regrets does that mean if we wish we could go back that we have regrets that far back 

228.94 233.19 A: um no i don't think it's so much regrets i think it's just 

233.28 246.38 A: [sigh] wanting to i would never want to start in the beginning and and i mean not in the beginning but in the middle and say well i would want to go back when i'm ten [sigh] i would want to start if i was going to start all over i might as well start all over from the beginning 

246.99 251.55 B: [noise] oh wow i i [noise] can't imagine doing that there's too much to change 

251.61 253.11 A: [laughter] oh 

252.85 254.51 B: but gee 

254.55 258.48 A: that would be uh that would be pretty wild definitely

420.26 422.76 A: (( they put you on the phone so i was like ah )) 

423.53 429.66 A: 'cause it doesn't tell you exactly what time they're going to call it just says what times you gave them and i gave them a lot of times because this is a cell phone 

429.34 433.06 B: [noise] yeah i gave a lot of times too and i'm looking for the 

433.23 435.88 B: [sigh] letter that i got but i don't see it 

435.80 438.72 A: i have it it says um [sigh] 

439.09 443.89 A: thank you for enrolling call length is ten minutes does that mean we get disconnected after ten minutes 

443.69 445.02 B: i guess so 

445.04 452.35 A: we ask that you speak about the topic for eight minutes after the ten minutes has expired you will have the opportunity to leave feedback about the call 

452.80 456.49 A: if you have caller i._d. the number will appears as one eight hundred 

457.19 462.45 A: this is a recruitment line if you have any questions call the at- call the number [mn] [lipsmack] 

461.07 463.94 B: yeah that's what i have i just pulled it up 

464.79 468.60 B: but i wonder what they're studying with time travel 

465.93 466.71 A: i 

470.07 478.95 A: don't know i don't i i've i don't [sigh] i mean i un- i know de- deja vu and all but [sigh] i would think that maybe that could also be sort of like a form of e._s._p. 

479.11 481.64 A: of like things that you feel are coming 

482.78 485.51 A: uh even sometimes like i'll have a dream 

485.16 486.31 B: mhm 

485.61 494.61 A: and then i'll fell that things [noise] are kind of close to what i dreamed about but i don't think that was a you know any way a time travel i thought it was more along the lines of and e._s._p. 

494.97 495.90 B: oh 

496.99 501.52 B: let's see it says give your opinions and the benefit of your personal experience 

503.61 504.38 B: (( hm )) 

505.63 508.26 B: [noise] well i definitely believe in e._s._p. 

508.92 512.94 B: and i think the power of the mind allows us to do just about anything 

514.32 515.28 B: you know 

514.66 516.06 A: yeah yes 

515.98 529.17 B: like in this book i'm reading the guy um survived the bombing of dresden in world war two [sigh] and he keeps going back to horrible memories of it every time he goes from one room to another or if he's somewhere and he gets humiliated 

529.18 533.56 B: [sigh] or if he goes from a dark room out into the light 

534.03 536.13 B: and he travels back and forth 

536.72 537.83 B: that way 

538.94 540.22 A: really 

540.23 541.98 A: (( so what's the name of that )) 

541.75 544.64 B: mhm slaughterhouse five it's by kurt vonnegut 

545.04 548.14 A: i've heard of that name but you know what i've never actually 

548.55 550.08 A: [lipsmack] read the um 

550.39 556.18 A: inscription on the book but i [mn] when you hear a name like that you would think you know horror 

556.09 557.30 B: (( mhm )) 

557.08 560.20 A: along the lines but that's very interesting 

560.52 568.66 A: [sigh] it would be nice though if you could time travel [noise] it would definitely be nice although i'm sure it would cost a lot of money [laughter] to do it [laughter] 

560.86 562.18 B: yeah 

568.07 581.14 B: mhm [lipsmack] but they asked about changing something in the past and [sigh] maybe i shouldn't have answered in something so selfish you know maybe if we had [sigh] cited like a world event that we could have changed 

569.44 570.35 A: (( if they )) 

581.29 583.74 B: you know like the holocaust or 

581.77 582.33 A: (( [mn] )) 

584.75 585.75 A: yeah 

586.28 596.94 A: but yeah but then you but if you did that then you'd also be [noise] changing a whole bunch of you know other people's lives too so [sigh] maybe it was good to be just selfish 

586.77 587.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

596.43 599.56 B: [noise] yeah but nothing bad would come out of [noise] st-
