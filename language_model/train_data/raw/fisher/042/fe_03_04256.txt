106.83 107.60 A: yes 

108.32 117.99 B: i was quite okay with the idea and so this guy he wrote to me the first time i was pretty impressed with his mail and uh then he called me over 

118.02 119.89 B: once so i was like 

120.13 127.57 B: quite okay with the idea and then this kind of continued for over a period of two three months he would keep calling me up every day because it's more 

127.39 135.44 B: cheap to call from here than from india so he would me up [laughter] so we would talk for about an hour half an hour and so on [lipsmack] 

129.30 131.36 A: yes [laughter] 

135.69 146.73 B: and uh he was pretty regular in his mails and from his mails i could make out that he liked me and he would [mn] often mention it in his mails as well [sigh] and even i started developing a liking for him you know a kind of attachment develops 

146.32 147.10 A: yes 

146.58 159.70 B: when you are regularly communicating with a person [sigh] so it was kind of like that [sigh] and uh but i don't know what happened all of a sudden he stopped writing he stopped calling me up and i was like fairly surprised what happened and i was [mn]

159.64 169.86 B: he had also called up my parents once and he had like said that everything is okay and i'm pretty prepared to marry this girl and stuff like that [sigh] and then all of a sudden i got to know that he is coming to india 

159.85 160.41 A: (( [noise] )) 

169.86 182.61 B: [sigh] and uh okay so we decided to set up a meeting so his parents called up my parents and they said okay we meet in a particular place [sigh] and uh what we got to know later was that they had given us the wrong address [sigh] so 

182.51 189.83 B: actually they did not want both of us to meet what whatever transpired between his parents and the guy i really don't understand and uh 

189.80 201.46 B: but finally the meeting was set or something like that happened and we met [sigh] but and during that meeting also it was pretty obvious that he wants to marry me and he wants to like uh spend his life with me and stuff 

201.02 202.36 A: [laughter] 

201.36 207.39 B: and uh i was also you know i had got really attached to this guy [sigh] but uh

217.56 218.59 A: (( yeah )) 

224.99 236.09 B: didn't go ahead with the thing [sigh] so that's one thing i would like to change and now i'm married and i've got a very very nice guy as a husband he is very loving very caring and i really thank god that that thing you know

330.16 344.90 B: [lipsmack] i was i always used to stand first in my class and stuff like that i was really into studies so much so that i was saturated by the time i reached standard eleven [laughter] and my parents had great expectations from me that i would do you know some engineering and stuff like that and i would 

337.63 338.76 A: (( oh my oh no )) 

344.69 355.96 B: really do well [sigh] but i don't know what happened to me i really don't have a reason but i just kind of left studying altogether from standard eleven and after that i just like it started deteriorating 

355.82 356.79 A: [laughter] 

356.02 370.27 B: i don't know what happened [laughter] so i really couldn't do much you know and as far as studies were concerned and [mn] i don't know what happened [laughter] so if i could i would have changed that but then again it's life [laughter] you can't do anything about it
