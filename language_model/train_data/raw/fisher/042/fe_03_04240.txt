183.01 195.12 A: well i'm forty eight years old and um i waited till i was twenty seven to have my children [sigh] i probably could have waited longer 'cause there are but it would have been some more traveling i would have wanted to do [sigh] and um 

195.51 198.97 A: i think my uh strongest 

199.02 199.93 A: uh 

200.13 208.34 A: [sigh] i i'm glad that i'm forty seven now my i don't have any grandchildren so i'm young enough to still enjoy my kids and the grandchildren and we're close [lipsmack] 

208.84 218.77 A: um [sigh] but i i sometimes often think [mn] when you think of the amount of expense and the things that you go through raising children [sigh] um 

219.83 224.84 A: not that you don't want them but i can agree that it would have been nice n- not to have had them 

224.98 228.69 A: uh there would have been so many more things and i could have been a little bit more selfish 

229.26 230.58 B: (( [noise] mm [noise] )) 

229.88 237.57 A: um you know a- and and doing for myself i raised them for myself they were two y- and three years old when i got divorced

238.24 239.92 B: oh wow 

239.47 244.16 A: and their father wasn't real supportive so it it uh it was a rough road 

244.14 244.92 B: ex- 

245.08 251.41 B: see [cough] that's exac- it's not that you didn't want them [sigh] i'm just saying it from it would have been 

248.35 249.13 A: right 

251.50 254.37 B: you waited until you was twenty seven i was nineteen 

254.23 258.18 A: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

254.42 257.66 B: [sigh] do you you understand what i'm saying nineteen [sigh] 

257.88 262.74 B: i should have waited until i was i- in my twenties it would have been much easier 

263.68 267.95 B: 'cause twenty seven was ex- and you had you raised two by yourself 

267.53 268.59 A: (( yeah )) 

269.43 271.06 B: [sigh] boy and girl [sigh] 

270.43 272.23 A: a boy and a girl yeah

278.05 280.98 A: [sigh] um they're doing well um 

280.03 281.79 B: then you did a good job 

281.63 289.64 A: [sigh] yeah my son's still tr- struggling you know he's struggling with his own identity and what he really wants to do in the world um 

289.78 290.34 B: (( [noise] )) 

290.49 292.37 A: n- not unlike a lot of kids 

291.94 293.87 B: (( [noise] [sigh] exactly )) 

293.26 295.13 A: you know [sigh] um 

295.34 301.66 A: [mn] and i think maybe if he had more of a father influence in his life that might have been different 'cause i never remarried 

302.98 307.54 A: so it would have been nice to have remarried and had help with raising them also 

306.94 309.42 B: can i ask you why you never remarried 

309.65 320.76 A: um yeah you can ask me um actually i never really i got so busy trying to provide for them and give for them um that i never really took the time for personal relationships 

320.89 326.30 A: [sigh] so i always chose men who were um emotionally unavailable 

325.92 327.28 B: mhm 

326.80 334.53 A: um because i really didn't want to get into a relationship where i had someone telling my children what to do and how to do it 

335.21 336.48 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

336.59 338.82 A: and maybe that was selfish on my part 

340.89 342.93 B: (( oh you know [noise] [sigh] )) 

341.19 347.49 A: [mn] and i got busy in the business world and climbing the corporate ladder and and there just wasn't time 

348.37 350.78 B: and do you regret not having 

351.14 353.80 B: you regret it i mean really regret it 

353.27 360.76 A: [sigh] no i don't really regret it but you know i i have a a really good person in my life now but i still don't think i would get married again 

360.96 365.23 A: [sigh] um because financially we're not on the same um level 

367.16 368.28 A: (( um )) 

369.43 370.86 A: and that's important 

370.98 372.52 A: i think that's important 

374.95 375.98 B: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

376.79 379.96 B: [sigh] so i'm just thinking i never remarried 

380.41 393.59 B: [noise] [cough] i got s- i was separated maybe when i was twenty five i never r- remarried [sigh] i had one serious relationship and i didn't want to pursue it any further because [sigh] if you start you get married 

393.39 400.14 B: that man considers himself the father i couldn't see anybody spanking my children i don't believe in hitting 

399.37 399.97 A: (( oh )) 

399.98 401.12 A: [laughter] 

400.21 404.56 B: i couldn't no i that i find that amazing that you never remarried [noise] 

403.94 411.62 A: oh well i'm the same reason i didn't want another man stepping into my life and [sigh] and taking over my children and and um fathering them 

411.42 421.95 B: [noise] that's the only part of it i sometimes i i say i missed out on some things but then i look at other people and that's not a good way to gauge you life [sigh] and i see 

422.13 429.78 B: all the arguments and i see people staying together [sigh] only because they still have children [sigh] and then i say i didn't do too bad 

429.45 430.68 A: and that's right 

430.73 432.04 B: you know so 

431.33 436.06 A: we didn't do bad at all did we [laughter] [laughter] 

432.91 434.10 B: no [laughter] 

434.59 437.68 B: i'm really grateful i didn't remarry 

437.12 437.91 A: (( oh )) 

437.71 439.25 B: i'm not saying that 

439.29 447.39 B: i don't have someone that's special [mn] but we live in different apartments which is marvelous [sigh] and um 

444.21 445.32 A: mhm

449.45 450.89 B: exactly 

451.38 458.75 B: exactly because i like sometimes to be alone i really enjoy it [sigh] there's times that we're together [sigh] 

458.80 462.94 B: and i'll be in one room and they'll be in another room and that's fine for me too 

462.48 463.79 A: [noise] that's right 

463.92 465.76 A: mhm 

464.35 467.19 B: you know it's fine okay [noise] 

466.49 470.26 A: yes and that's important to be at peace within your own being 

469.95 471.26 B: exactly 

470.58 474.22 A: and you don't have to have someone in your life to find that peace 

474.12 476.13 B: (( [sigh] no because you have your own and that's a great feeling )) 

475.64 476.78 A: that's right 

476.79 478.54 A: (( yeah )) 

477.20 479.76 B: ((  ))
