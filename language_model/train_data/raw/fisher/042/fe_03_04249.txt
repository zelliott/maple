9.18 10.46 A: (( hi aaron )) 

10.59 11.48 B: (( hi )) 

12.96 16.03 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] so [cough] i'm sorry uh-huh 

13.35 14.68 B: so that 

16.25 21.69 B: oh i just um i didn't know what the topic was until just a second ago did you 

21.42 31.87 A: [sigh] eee uh yes yes she said that if you can go back into time [sigh] and change what will it be and why would you change it 

31.79 34.12 B: well would you like to start or should i 

33.80 35.73 A: [sigh] um 

35.86 43.23 A: [lipsmack] i'm going to just start where i can think of what i would change you know [lipsmack] i'm trying to think what [laughter] 

43.92 48.50 A: so maybe i should uh just start can you think of something right away or you need me to start 

47.87 51.38 B: yeah no i could think of something off the top of my head 

50.76 51.90 A: oh okay 

51.47 52.22 B: (( i know )) 

52.62 56.11 B: i think wh- when it in nineteen ninety five when 

56.74 60.52 B: when i i was worked i was looking for work 

60.89 64.89 B: i ch- i choose a job at a newspaper 

64.60 65.76 A: mhm 

65.11 68.46 B: and uh i think that if i had it to do over again 

68.66 74.04 B: i would've looked elsewhere 'cause i- i wound up working there for a number of years 

74.17 77.01 B: didn't it wasn't good for me 

76.92 82.99 B: th- they didn't treat me right and i i i didn't respect myself 

82.87 93.66 B: i just i was doing a lot of extra work for not much money and it was just a bad situation and i think it didn't didn't really uh do much 

94.14 97.35 B: it probably was was more detrimental to my 

97.57 99.28 B: wellbeing and my 

99.54 101.00 B: just my uh 

101.20 106.03 B: my outlook that i that i was getting from it so i guess i do regret that 

105.45 106.79 A: oh okay 

106.40 111.26 B: and you know there there's something that if i had to do over i probably would have done differently 

110.71 113.48 A: do it differently [sigh] well um 

113.60 114.41 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

114.47 119.53 A: in ninety one speaking about job i took a early retirement 

119.89 134.24 A: [lipsmack] and if i had a chance to change that over i would go ahead and work a little longer because i found out [lipsmack] by taking an early retirement because i had really planned [lipsmack] in early life retire at the age of fifty 

134.26 142.25 A: [lipsmack] because i was thinking that i was going to still be married but at the time that i retired in ninety one [lipsmack] i had gotten a divorce 

142.49 144.50 A: and that um 

144.82 149.29 A: i took this early retirement and then i went into 

149.41 160.51 A: benefit and i lost a lot of money [lipsmack] and i wished that i had stayed there 'til [lipsmack] i had like maybe uh [cough] five more years to work [lipsmack] and it would have been 

160.51 169.64 A: at my uh beneficiary because i would have had more of a pension chat [sigh] and then when i first stopped working i was um 

169.67 179.90 A: you know thought that i had uh really a lot of time [sigh] and i kind of like over extended myself 'cause i was doing a lot of different things [sigh] that i was just doing 

179.79 194.26 A: [sigh] without any pay or anything like that and as i retired [lipsmack] i really needed something for my time but then [lipsmack] you got caught up in it and people expect you to do these things [sigh] without any charge or pay or what have you 

194.50 199.23 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] so um [lipsmack] then you know i look back 

199.72 211.94 A: [lipsmack] i think that i would have done it a little differently [lipsmack] i would have stayed on the job [lipsmack] but i'm happy now you know 'cause things have [sigh] um smoothed down i've uh 

212.26 213.24 A: gotten 

213.25 217.89 A: to um kind of adjusted to what i get 

218.01 231.45 A: and then all of my kids are [lipsmack] all grown they was grown at that time but they they're all more settled now and and on their own and doing for themselves and [lipsmack] some of my boys can help me out 

231.76 233.38 A: so i can 

233.67 237.34 A: do basically a lot of travelling now and so when i do uh 

237.47 238.92 A: volunteer work 

239.01 240.52 A: i don't really 

240.66 252.93 A: uh feel bad about it because you know i do it because it's in my heart but at beginning there was times that i had wished that some of the things that i were doing when i was in atlanta 

253.10 260.69 A: [sigh] people would say well she's not working now so we can't have her running here and there and doing this without offering her something [sigh] 

260.64 273.29 A: but [lipsmack] people have the tendency you know just think that you have it because you're not showing that you don't have it and you're not complaining or anything like that so i would have uh 

271.97 272.70 B: yeah 

273.52 277.82 A: that i would change that you know if i had to do that all over again 

277.44 278.28 B: (( okay )) 

278.52 279.63 A: mhm 

278.84 282.81 B: they do too often they do take advantage of someone like that [laughter] 

282.60 286.81 A: yeah people have a tendency [sigh] to really take an advantage when you 

286.84 289.76 A: try to help and then and then to me 

289.85 296.26 A: when you see a person doing for you then when they get in to a position they can't do then that don't 

296.67 307.66 A: to me that should make you want to do for that individual because you should appreciate it [sigh] when they were able to do they did now they're not able to do so now everybody kind of like back off 

308.17 309.45 A: and don't do 

309.75 310.74 B: yeah 

310.26 311.82 A: mhm 

311.41 312.44 B: mhm 

311.86 313.31 A: and so uh 

313.35 316.06 A: that is one of the things that uh 

316.23 318.40 A: i you know i would change 

318.91 326.85 A: and some of the things that if i'd gotten more experience and everything i had my children [lipsmack] at an early age 

327.02 335.60 A: i wouldn't uh [cough] would of changed that situation but [sigh] now that they uh 

335.44 343.88 A: the situation today how how young people are and and people that are having babies i just [sigh] really couldn't see myself having children now 

344.07 345.61 A: in this um 

346.23 349.77 A: [lipsmack] later stage because everybody is is so different 

349.62 350.47 B: yeah 

349.80 364.40 A: and uh you can't say nothing to your kids you know really [sigh] you can't really discipline because they take it [lipsmack] as something else and the kids are calling nine one one and this kind of thing 'cause i was firm with bringing mine up 

364.45 367.19 A: [lipsmack] and so i would probably um 

367.67 370.39 A: wouldn't i'm glad that i did um 

370.54 383.72 A: had my children when i had them because of the situation is today but [cough] when you look at [sigh] uh reality of things it would've been better if i had waited til i gotten older 

374.76 375.51 B: yeah 

383.77 389.94 A: to have children 'cause i wouldn't have had them so fast and i wouldn't have had so many then had to wind up getting a divorce 

390.94 394.12 A: (( i advise you know anyone that's uh [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

394.42 396.68 A: haven't had any children that the 

396.70 409.32 A: you know get married enjoy each other first and then plan a family don't start with the family til they [sigh] plan to have the family so it just boom i'm pregnant [sigh] hadn't made no plans or whatever 

409.69 419.14 B: yeah that's well that's where i'm at with my wife now we just got married about six months ago and [sigh] we we don't to have children until we've planned it out 

418.69 431.59 A: right well that's the best thing to do because it's a big responsibility and a lot of times people [sigh] don't realize what a big responsibility it is until when they get into it basically young people [lipsmack] they want to get out of it when 

419.57 420.35 B: (( yeah )) 

420.50 421.23 B: (( okay )) 

423.36 424.30 B: yeah 

431.59 434.86 A: a parent want to be a lot and other parent are stuck with it you know 

434.85 435.96 B: yeah 

435.41 439.99 A: so but when you make plans for them [sigh] then that could be a beautiful thing 

440.08 441.30 B: yeah it can 

440.82 445.24 A: 'cause um i appreciate uh my kids now they're 

445.34 451.87 A: old enough now to appreciate what i sacrificed for them with bringing them up 

451.50 452.55 B: (( be yeah )) 

452.02 453.21 A: mhm 

453.99 455.59 A: yep 

455.78 462.62 B: it's uh it's uh it's interesting for me to to hear it from you and your experience to know 

462.81 468.86 B: that the i'm thirty two i didn't i just uh i married a bit late but 

468.60 471.31 A: well you know what that's a good age to marry 

469.29 469.99 B: (( what )) 

471.33 472.14 B: yeah 

471.38 473.29 A: because uh 

473.33 474.30 A: if for 

474.36 477.86 A: some reason and it's true people used to say that but a lot of times 

477.76 489.13 A: being a male they don't believe that [sigh] but a man does not mature as fast as a woman does and i think a man shouldn't get married 'til he get about thirty 

485.86 486.65 B: right 

489.03 495.17 A: [lipsmack] and i think between thirty and thirty five is a good age for most men to get married 

495.04 496.63 B: i have to agree with you 

496.33 497.41 A: yeah 

496.73 499.65 B: i know i just don't think i was ready back then 

499.31 507.62 A: right no and a lot of young people they get married back like my husband and i we got married at a early early age 

507.33 508.28 B: yeah 

507.72 514.85 A: and uh he wasn't ready for a family and so we wind up getting a divorce and i had to wind up 

514.89 526.86 A: bringing up six children up by myself 'cause he didn't even help [lipsmack] but now he appreciate them now because they all doing very well and doing good so now he want to be the great father 

526.81 538.63 A: which is cool because i always taught my kids you know [lipsmack] you love him because he's your father and you know i was saying that when people do you wrong you treat them better [lipsmack] and that'll make them [lipsmack] feel 

538.64 539.57 A: uh 

539.88 547.94 A: sorry for what they've done but if you treat them the way they treated you then they feel justified of not doing what they should've done 

548.17 550.61 A: [lipsmack] instead of feeling guilty you know 

550.64 555.28 A: and so they uh and he got the place that he needed them 

550.72 552.20 B: yeah hm 

555.37 562.28 A: and uh but when he remarried he did better because he was ready for a family 

562.36 565.03 A: because he had two from the second wife 

565.22 569.46 A: [cough] and they don't do nothing for him now since he gotten sick and everything but 

570.04 574.04 A: [lipsmack] anyway i you know my kids they they there for him now 

574.82 582.74 A: and uh and you know i appreciate that i used to kind of like feel [sigh] a little jealous then i say how could i be jealous of something that i 

583.02 584.78 A: put into them you know 

585.42 586.15 B: (( [cough] yeah yeah )) 

585.49 587.16 A: hm so uh 

587.21 590.45 A: so but you um you know you ought to take your time 

590.49 592.61 A: and you know plan for your for 

592.77 594.86 A: your babies you know 

595.26 599.95 A: and get everything all planned up so when you when the baby do 

595.68 596.64 B: (( yeah ))
