149.85 152.45 A: uh prospects a lot easier 

152.27 153.27 B: uh-huh 

153.55 155.47 A: because uh you would 

155.52 157.08 A: like you said you would get 

157.17 160.29 A: get yours in in like an industrial area 

160.33 163.14 A: so then you would have your automatic clientele 

163.03 164.03 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

164.70 169.71 A: um and i think the ideal of having soups and salads is great 

170.33 173.92 B: [noise] [noise] huh [noise] not too many um sandwich shops would do that you know 

173.90 182.92 A: no they don't they they have sandwiches but they don't offer the like the soup and salads they usually just have sandwiches potato chips and a refreshment 

182.60 183.59 B: uh-huh 

184.77 187.66 A: (( so i think that soup and salads would be a great idea )) 

188.06 191.27 B: i like you know i do like [noise] a green salad and then 

190.80 191.61 A: uh-huh 

191.28 197.54 B: like um macaroni salad and potato [noise] different types of potato salad 

197.22 199.75 A: yeah i should think i think that'd be a great idea 

198.57 199.73 B: [noise] 

200.49 204.27 B: [noise] is when i make potato salad 

204.52 206.36 B: everybody compliments it [noise] 

206.42 211.47 B: so i think i'd do well with selling all my [noise] potato salad in the day [noise] 

206.46 207.30 A: uh-huh 

211.47 212.36 A: uh-huh 

213.90 217.66 B: (( and i'm pretty geared up t- making homemade soup [noise] [noise] )) 

218.43 219.88 A: oh that'd be great 

222.01 225.94 A: i i just i think that's a real good good idea i really do 

225.04 228.71 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] and i think probably [noise] i'd have maybe 

229.51 232.60 B: [noise] three or four extra employees 

232.77 233.65 A: uh-huh 

233.76 234.86 B: [noise] going in 

235.67 239.39 B: two probably strictly for back in the kitchen to help [noise] 

238.61 239.51 A: uh-huh 

239.68 242.17 B: and then [noise] the rest 

242.23 249.01 B: doing the cashere- cashiering and clearing away tables and stuff you know but real [noise] 

248.37 251.22 A: and what and how many hours would you be open a day 

251.18 252.12 B: um 

253.53 256.12 A: would you just mainly do for the lunch hour 

255.23 260.99 B: [noise] i'd probably do like mainly the lunch hour and then maybe if i could 

261.39 264.66 B: hire enough people to do like for the 

264.68 267.73 B: people who worked swing shift or a graveyard shift [noise] 

267.78 268.64 A: uh-huh 

272.01 275.01 B: so that way they could get something to eat too 

275.18 276.37 A: well yeah 

276.64 280.19 A: yes well it would just depend if it was that big of an area 

279.40 281.02 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

283.13 286.14 A: yeah that that to me that sounds like a very good idea 

284.77 286.02 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

288.10 292.81 A: because most most sandwich places like i said just have potato chips and a drink 

291.73 293.78 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

294.54 300.29 A: like to have something fresh to go along with it maybe even uh offer a pudding or a dessert 

299.81 301.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

301.53 302.94 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

302.45 304.93 A: then they could have a complete meal at once 

305.70 306.50 B: (( [noise] )) 

306.70 309.25 B: i think it do like um [noise] 

309.57 318.31 B: you know have meal deals where you buy [noise] pay so much for the soup and the salad and the sandwich [noise] it also includes a [noise] beverage in the price 

319.14 323.16 A: uh-huh yeah th- that's that's a good idea that's a real good idea 

321.64 322.60 B: [noise] 

323.96 324.77 B: [noise] 

325.87 327.24 B: [noise] 

327.90 329.59 B: (( [noise] that's my cockatiel )) 

329.76 331.67 A: i can hear it [laughter]

348.50 352.77 B: uh-huh all my birds are like that [noise] [laughter] 

351.28 353.22 A: [laughter] [laughter] how many you got 

352.99 355.92 B: i got two cockatiels [noise] and 

356.51 358.78 B: four parakeets [noise] 

358.52 360.33 A: oh i like parakeets 

361.75 362.75 B: [noise] 

363.05 365.97 A: but i don't have any in uh any animals anymore 

363.40 365.10 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

365.83 367.49 B: [noise] oh 

366.91 368.73 A: too old too old for that 

369.62 375.83 B: i live in an apartment so it's easier than [noise] having a cat i prefer dogs and i'm not really a cat person so 

373.84 374.73 A: uh-huh 

376.09 376.90 A: uh-huh 

376.59 377.81 B: (( and that way [noise] you can )) 

377.92 383.81 B: bypass getting paying the pet deposit [noise] 'cause birds [noise] don't damage nothing you know 

380.63 381.62 A: uh-huh 

383.94 385.38 A: yeah yeah 

385.61 386.68 B: [noise] 

390.97 393.97 B: [noise] [noise] how b- how big of a fitness center would you [noise] 

394.35 395.73 B: (( you thinking [noise] [noise] )) 

394.71 397.96 A: i think i would go i would go mainly for women 

398.24 399.33 B: mhm 

398.35 399.55 A: just women 

399.63 403.46 A: and and more do on the exercise 

399.78 400.61 B: (( [noise] )) 

403.51 406.92 A: not your i mean not the exercise but more on the nutrition 

404.10 404.70 B: (( [noise] )) 

406.79 407.70 B: uh-huh 

408.24 416.84 A: uh i think i think there's enough on the exercise but to do the do the nutrition to go along with the exercise 

408.38 409.13 B: [noise] 

417.13 419.09 A: um and specialize 

419.46 424.18 A: if a person had a special problem that that problem could be taken care of 

419.69 420.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

424.44 426.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

424.53 427.42 A: instead of just an overall program 

427.84 429.81 B: uh that sounds good 

429.18 431.89 A: that they could have a specialized program 

429.86 431.58 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

432.68 442.21 A: uh if it was with diet or if it was because they ha- uh are handicapped or or whatever so the program would be specialized just to them 

433.55 434.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

443.18 445.66 B: that would be a good idea [noise] [mn] 

445.70 446.63 A: um 

446.30 448.38 B: there's not too many um 

446.82 447.39 A: (( [mn] )) 

448.54 450.40 B: [noise] just for female 

451.04 454.14 B: fitness centers [noise] right out there right now 

452.74 460.19 A: no they have they have no they have curves out there and curves is going great and and i belong to curves 

460.21 470.53 A: but i just think that they need to have more to go into um if they [mn] if more specialized for that person instead of just for everybody 

470.26 471.63 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

471.44 479.34 A: but use the you use this machine this machine this machine and this machine and it will help you with the problem that you are having 

479.69 480.57 A: (( um )) 

480.80 492.53 A: instead of you use all these machines that uses all the muscles of your body but if you got [mn] got a certain problem you want to put a little bit more effort into just that 

491.59 495.46 B: [noise] and target specifically that problem area 

493.78 494.68 A: yes 

495.20 504.63 A: uh-huh be able to target it with diet and with the exercise and and anything else that may have to be done for that area so that that 

504.98 508.83 A: that they're being satisfied i'm working on the problem area 

509.54 510.49 B: yeah 

511.01 517.29 A: 'cause i have a problem area and all i'm doing is i'm toning the whole body and that's great 

517.21 530.88 A: but i also need to take care of this problem so that i can tone it as well i've lost so much weight that if i was to just go ahead and and tone i'm still not gonna get rid of my butt because 

530.73 533.07 A: the rest of the body has lost its weight 

532.83 534.03 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

533.86 542.54 A: so that part needs special attention and they need to be able to help me with whatever i got to do to pay for special attention to that part of the body 

543.49 545.68 A: and that's the kind of center i would do 

547.19 553.67 A: that would specialize for that person's condition and if it was medical or physical or whatever it was 

553.85 555.46 B: (( [noise] that'd be great )) 

556.32 567.84 A: and and not dealing with just supplements and stuff like that things just about you know so there would be a lot of restriction to it to find out what's wrong with why why the problem is there 

567.53 568.72 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

570.10 582.71 A: [lipsmack] [mn] that's the type of thing i would like to do i'm not just a regular type fitness center and designated just to women because we have so many problems so many spots that will accumulate fat and it's hard to get rid of it 

576.02 576.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

582.14 584.25 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] oh yeah [noise] )) 

586.56 589.20 A: 'cause i i've lost seventy pounds in two years 

587.14 587.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

588.93 591.22 B: (( [noise] [noise] wow that's great huh )) 

591.04 594.34 A: but i i've still got a gut on me that i can't get rid of 

594.17 598.31 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah that's my problem i have a gut and my thighs huh )) 

598.44 599.95 A: (( well my my thighs are pretty ))
