26.57 38.61 B: yeah and i guess when i think of time travel i think of like going back in history [sigh] you know and not so much going back like within my life and changing something i think of it oh like wouldn't it be interesting just to live [sigh] you know like 

30.29 31.74 A: mhm right 

38.53 42.16 B: two day like little house on the prairie [laughter] 

40.26 52.43 A: right [sigh] you know they have some situations like that i've seen them on uh p. v. s. [sigh] where they go back to like the stone age time and live in or [sigh] there was a [lipsmack] 

45.74 46.64 B: uh-huh 

49.38 50.26 B: yeah 

52.50 57.77 A: a series of of living on the prairie as pioneers [sigh] the women didn't like it at all 

55.52 56.43 B: yeah 

57.25 59.49 B: [sigh] oh i'm sure yeah 

58.21 61.61 A: [laughter] i think the men though it was pretty cool 

61.21 69.17 B: yeah probably they that way they could show their manliness some [laughter] and we could show how vulnerable we are [laughter] 

63.95 66.68 A: right [sigh] right [sigh] so 

67.65 71.21 A: right and how hard it is to work without modern conveniences 

70.19 74.91 B: yeah and you know the only things you can cook with is flour and water [laughter] 

73.13 75.30 A: exactly right [sigh] 

74.92 77.99 B: ooh that'll be a good meal [laughter] 

76.16 80.66 A: [laughter] [sigh] so thinking about our own lives uh 

80.05 82.32 B: gosh yeah mhm 

81.74 82.78 A: um 

82.88 84.34 A: [sigh] well 

85.41 91.09 A: sometimes i i'm uh fifty four years old and [sigh] i 

91.03 95.73 A: had a child very late or adopted a child very late uh and she's 

95.61 106.96 A: aged twelve [sigh] and sometimes i look ahead in her life and think gosh i'm going to be you know it's hard enough keeping up with her now [sigh] i wish that i had had a child earlier i think [sigh] 

102.36 103.32 B: yeah 

106.59 111.45 B: mhm yeah [sigh] see that would be me we have i'm thirty three i'll be thirty four this year 

111.28 121.97 B: [sigh] and i look around like at all of my friends that are my age you know they've got two or three kids and [sigh] you know they're in the minivan scene and and everything and [sigh] 

116.97 118.36 A: mhm 

119.77 120.69 A: mhm 

121.75 126.68 B: and i've just got one child and and now that my daughter she's seven 

126.23 127.20 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

126.58 139.27 B: and i'm thinking oh my gosh you know she's so independent i don't have to do anything [sigh] you know i've been able to come back to work [sigh] and you know make extra money and i'm thinking you know if i had 

131.27 132.48 A: mhm 

139.11 143.98 B: now i'm at the age too where i think you know i wish i had one more 

143.53 144.45 A: uh-huh 

143.92 156.41 B: and i'm thinking if i could go back that's what i would do i would when she was two i would have gotten pregnant again [sigh] and had another child [sigh] and now at the stage of life that i'm in and where she's at i don't want to do that 

149.32 150.63 A: mhm 

155.80 157.74 A: it would be hard to change that it [mn] 

156.71 167.88 B: yeah it would be hard to change that it would be like a major upheaval in our life [sigh] and you know and i guess it's never too late until your body's time clock says uh that's it [sigh] but then then 

160.06 161.57 A: mhm mhm 

165.25 166.18 A: mhm 

166.53 176.13 A: [sigh] or even then i mean that's what my body said and and instead of having a child [sigh] biologically i adopted so you can always [sigh] you can always add on [sigh] 

173.38 174.16 B: yeah 

175.28 176.46 B: yeah that's true 

176.41 190.60 B: uh my husband would never be open to that and so that's probably [sigh] he's like you know not when you're capable of having one and i'm like [sigh] but there are millions of kids out there that don't have parents and [sigh] so i would be so incredibly open to it but he would be like uh taboo type thing 

178.36 179.18 A: no 

183.47 184.57 A: mhm 

184.84 185.81 A: mhm 

189.72 200.70 A: mhm mhm [sigh] well it costs a lot more when you [sigh] don't make it in your own bedroom you know [laughter] [sigh] go through it [sigh] uh but i don't want to get off the topic here [sigh] um 

194.77 195.56 B: yeah 

196.08 197.15 B: yeah 

197.79 198.35 B: (( yeah )) 

202.56 204.61 A: i i think uh 

204.67 209.68 A: i'm trying to think of some other situation can you think of something else you would you would change if you went back 

208.26 210.98 B: gosh i probably would have went to college 

210.32 211.30 A: mhm 

211.00 213.51 B: 'cause i chose not to go to college 

213.36 221.22 B: and went directly into the workforce [sigh] had a you know had a good job it was available to me right when i graduated [sigh] and i probably [sigh] 

215.60 216.50 A: mhm 

220.99 235.27 B: would have went back i would have went to college and pursued [sigh] you know like a career per se something that i went and you know specialized in like you know whether it be teaching or a nurse or whatever [sigh] so i i would have gone to school [sigh] 

227.22 228.28 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

232.53 233.56 A: mhm 

235.05 244.05 B: and instead of gone directly into the workforce if i had to go back and [sigh] and do it all over again [laughter] and change that 

241.25 243.28 A: mhm mhm 

244.17 251.92 A: [sigh] um i do i remembered something this morn- that i was thinking about just today or yesterday that [sigh] i've um 

251.94 257.21 A: made a lot of job changes in my career and [sigh] um 

254.30 255.27 B: yeah 

257.01 262.09 A: it seems that and it always seemed like i was going to something better but [sigh] um 

261.90 274.02 A: when i look back on those changes i was just thinking [sigh] if i had stayed at the original place i would probably have made a lot more progress than i have now that i [sigh] i would have um [sigh] 

270.22 271.04 B: yeah 

271.51 272.37 B: yeah 

274.13 281.89 A: you know uh established a longer term relationship with the people i would probably be making a lot more money 

281.97 283.22 A: (( i )) 

283.16 296.85 A: thought at the time that i made some changes that i would not be happy if i stayed but [sigh] i ended up not being all that happy because i'm [mn] i've gone [sigh] changed around a little bit and um [sigh] 

294.98 295.83 B: yeah 

296.76 305.35 A: and you know sort of got off a ca- a career path that i think would have helped me be more [sigh] financially secure and [lipsmack] 

305.58 313.35 A: and that's a concern of mine right now so [sigh] i wish i'd stayed on the path that i was on originally and just stuck at it [sigh] 

312.74 313.63 B: yeah 

313.71 314.74 A: um 

315.07 320.43 A: i think well [sigh] i don't know i've i've also been divorced and and changed 

320.44 322.52 A: my life um 

322.35 335.07 A: [sigh] and i've been recently thinking if i had stayed and stuck it out could i have made changes in that initial relationship [sigh] that um [sigh] would have allowed me i mean i really am envious now of people who've been married [sigh] 

328.00 329.62 B: initial relationship 

334.91 342.69 A: twenty five years or more you know and [sigh] who have a r- really long term relationship with their partner [sigh] um 

337.36 338.28 B: yeah 

342.86 355.17 A: you know at the time that i made a change i thought i'm not going to have a relationship like that but maybe if i'd [sigh] tried harder and struggled through the difficulties and we'd [sigh] cooperated in a different way we would have grown [sigh] 

355.01 359.61 A: together and you know it w- might have been something more valuable 

355.39 356.29 B: mhm 

359.61 360.48 B: yeah 

359.74 360.88 A: at this point 

360.74 374.42 B: [sigh] i think a lot of people think that with the divorce rate as high as it is that if a lot of people looked back [sigh] on you know separations and divorces that [sigh] you know uh what if we would have gone to counseling what if we would have [sigh] you know just 

362.35 363.41 A: mhm 

364.21 365.18 A: yeah 

372.28 373.79 A: mhm 

374.44 380.05 B: uh you know sacrificed a little bit here or or gave a little bit more there and not been so 

376.47 377.65 A: mhm 

380.22 383.82 B: you know dogmatic that maybe [sigh] you know that 

382.79 385.11 A: right if i can't have it i'm leaving 

384.62 393.49 B: i'm leaving yeah [sigh] and then maybe our gen our gen our youth would be different you know because i think [sigh] the main people that it affects is when there's children involved 

385.31 386.53 A: mhm 

387.99 389.81 A: mhm right 

393.06 393.95 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

393.57 395.58 B: and so that could [lipsmack] 

395.96 399.57 B: you know the breakdown of the family so to speak in america 

398.12 399.34 A: right yeah 

399.56 412.11 A: [sigh] the other thing then i also go to before i even [mn] hooked up with that man maybe [sigh] maybe i should go back to just before i got married and not marry him you know if it's made a made a [mn] 

408.87 410.79 B: yeah yeah 

412.04 419.01 A: a more considered [sigh] decision about who i was going to be marrying and [mn] 

419.58 423.41 A: took into consideration more [sigh] the 

423.61 427.96 A: long term effects rather than what my feelings were about him at the time 

427.67 434.68 B: yeah [sigh] yeah and it i think there's like you know uh a country music song [sigh] um 

434.64 446.93 B: i c- forget who even sings it about [sigh] he tells uh the story about when he was younger that he always used to pray for this this certain you know lady for them to get married and [sigh] and how 

444.02 445.00 A: mhm 

446.81 454.95 B: he thanks god for unanswered prayers because if he um [sigh] if he had married her he wouldn't have known his wife as it is [sigh] and 

448.92 450.21 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] mhm wow )) 

454.16 455.59 A: mhm 

454.98 457.84 B: you know and it i remember when my um [lipsmack] [sigh] 

458.34 463.21 B: when my family when i was sixteen my mom and dad we were from illinois 

463.15 474.80 B: [sigh] and my parents lost both of their job uh pretty much like within two months [sigh] of one another [sigh] and so [mn] we upped and moved to um to tennessee 

475.35 481.39 B: [lipsmack] and you know here i am you know fifteen going on sixteen [sigh] you know steady boyfriend and everything 

479.86 482.03 A: mhm it must have been traumatic 

481.16 493.71 B: [sigh] o._h. i mean it was it was so awful and i think you know what if my parents had never [sigh] moved [sigh] how my life because now he's married to this other girl that was a friend of mine [sigh] and they live in um 

486.84 487.87 A: mhm 

491.34 492.36 A: mhm 

493.53 496.81 B: minneapolis [sigh] and i think you know 

494.32 495.50 A: mhm 

495.91 497.84 A: maybe you would have been there with him 

496.88 506.87 B: uh yeah and i think you know i am so thankful 'cause and now i hate cold weather i'm like i am so thankful [sigh] that my parents moved to tennessee and [sigh] 

500.15 501.14 A: mhm 

501.62 504.18 A: [laughter] mhm 

504.86 505.87 A: mhm 

506.65 518.98 B: and you know 'cause [mn] probably [mn] as fate would have had it had we stayed [sigh] you know i would have ended up marrying him because our families were like so incredibly close [sigh] his brother and um sister in law uh 

512.96 513.91 A: mhm 

518.83 533.57 B: were my parents best friends [sigh] his mom and day you know everybody we were just kind of like this family and [sigh] it was like oh well you know one day dan and julie they'll get married you know and [sigh] and but you know as as you know fate had it here

538.75 546.31 B: [sigh] long term i still i went to his senior prom [sigh] m- my parents drove me up there and he drove down here for my junior senior and then 

541.69 542.55 A: (( mm ))

552.42 553.41 A: (( mhm )) 

554.54 560.80 A: [laughter] yeah [sigh] so i guess you wouldn't change that you wouldn't stay there and marry him 

559.72 570.37 B: no i wouldn't yeah i wouldn't change that i would have [sigh] i would have had you know them move and [sigh] and my life end up this way rather than living in minneapolis [laughter]

569.64 574.84 A: oh [sigh] there's there's so many yeah whoa what a different life it would have been

574.61 576.90 B: oh gosh yeah 

576.09 579.89 A: and mine would have been different too if i'd stayed with that man i [sigh] 

579.87 587.48 A: i don't know that was one reason why i didn't have a child was because [sigh] he was a little too childish himself and didn't didn't really want a child 

587.12 588.11 B: yeah 

587.44 599.82 A: except um how many years like maybe ten years after our [sigh] breakup we were both in other relationships and did find [mn] both of us had children and [sigh] and established a friendship that was
