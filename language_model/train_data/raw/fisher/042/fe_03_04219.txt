88.35 91.06 B: oh yeah yeah definitely yeah 

90.46 96.40 A: i had a situation not not not really similar to yours but kinda along the same lines when i was uh 

96.42 101.09 A: i was probably i'm forty one right now but i was probably um 

98.98 100.08 B: mhm 

101.32 102.87 A: fifteen or sixteen 

103.20 104.63 A: and my um 

105.55 110.05 A: my grandmother the house that she lived in she died years before 

110.22 112.47 A: and my aunt and uncle were living in that house 

112.73 115.51 A: and they about all they ever did was watch t._v. 

115.93 119.15 A: and uh my uncle had left 

119.53 122.43 A: and my aunt was there by herself well she died 

123.04 125.64 A: and she had two kids but they were out of the house too but 

125.99 132.41 A: that was up they were going to sell the house my my dad and mom and uh all the you know relatives were going to sell the house 

132.59 139.85 A: so me and my brother were up there looking around before they sold it and up in the attic there were t._v. guides going to the nineteen fifties 

139.57 140.45 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

140.09 141.68 A: and there must have been 

141.91 146.38 A: i mean every there there was probably a t._v. guide for every week since nineteen fifties 

146.28 147.32 B: wow 

147.00 157.07 A: and uh me and my brother sat down and and just kinda went through them you know and noticed you know they're kind of kind of interesting and uh i remember one in particular it had a picture of elvis presley on the cover 

157.20 160.38 A: and it the date on that was like nineteen fifty four 

160.99 164.30 A: well about two weeks later i'm in a bookstore 

164.41 167.63 A: looking through this magazine and i see 

167.66 172.01 A: the the um the t._v. guide cover with elvis presley 

171.64 172.82 B: mhm 

172.20 173.98 A: it was worth ten thousand dollars 

173.76 175.34 B: [lipsmack] oh you're kidding 

174.73 180.69 A: well get started looking some more and a lot of them were worth money there was probably 

175.57 176.39 B: (( [laughter] )) 

176.72 177.65 B: yeah 

178.81 179.80 B: (( oh my god )) 

180.93 185.38 A: two or three hundred thousand dollars worth of collectible t._v. guides 

185.33 186.77 B: (( oh my god )) 

185.65 188.05 A: up there in that attic so me and my brother 

188.18 192.43 A: i was driving at this time and so i drove back home we rushed back to the house 

192.78 196.07 A: and somebody had already come through and threw everything away 

196.01 197.97 B: oh my god 

197.36 199.61 A: so if there's one thing i could change it would be 

199.62 202.25 A: go back and get those those t._v. guides 

201.82 206.58 B: you know that is so ironic because the amount of money that you mentioned three hundred thousand 

206.02 206.88 A: uh-huh 

207.14 217.17 B: well i i had lost probably about seven hundred thousand but some but all i took it out of this stock thing it was all in the stock market that smith barney put it in 

216.57 217.59 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

217.25 227.06 B: so it would have been it would have gone down at least by half so i probably would have ended up with the same amount uh that you say that you might have lost by not [laughter] funny 

224.18 225.44 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

227.35 229.24 A: (( so do you do anything on the stock market now )) 

228.76 231.39 B: um no absolutely not no i 

230.54 232.14 A: i've got one stock 

231.58 232.82 B: yeah 

232.19 234.46 A: it's uh marvel com- marvel comics 

234.04 235.75 B: oh [laughter] yeah 

234.88 239.65 A: and it that thing has has quadrupled my money in 

238.28 239.42 B: really 

240.33 241.73 A: in less than a year 

241.52 242.98 B: no kidding 

242.64 250.38 A: yep all the movies and stuff they they just came out and said that that now this was a dog stock i bought it at like four four fifty a share 

247.94 248.70 B: yeah 

249.95 251.31 B: yeah 

250.77 259.03 A: it was a dog two years ago well they've come out now and said that this company marvel comics it's marvel entertainment is probably 

257.37 258.40 B: (( yeah yeah right )) 

259.05 262.29 A: one of the top ten most profitable companies in united states 

262.70 263.70 B: wow 

263.55 269.75 A: their their their profit last quarter they returned forty percent profit on revenue 

270.78 271.96 B: wow 

271.31 275.33 A: so forty forty cents out of every dollar they brought in was profit 

275.77 278.55 A: it's because all they've got is intellectual property 

277.79 280.58 B: yeah yeah yeah 

279.81 286.15 A: so if you're looking to buy any stock look at marvel 'cause they they still got a lot of room to go up they're less than twenty dollars a share mm [noise] 

282.11 284.84 B: oh oh i'll look at it oh yeah 

285.41 294.06 B: yeah if i have any extra money ever i'll look at that sure yeah right now it's a little tight yeah oh that's interesting yeah 

294.47 297.68 B: mm yeah i do have some funds which are 

297.85 298.91 B: (( i don't know )) 

299.21 303.52 B: i don't know how they're doing 'cause it goes up one day down the next you know you know 

302.39 304.23 A: oh yeah mine too it's 

303.66 308.88 B: the market uh i think basically well i don't know every 

308.26 312.89 A: i'm just looking at marvel right now it's up twenty seven cents today 

312.61 316.12 B: (( oh right [laughter] so you think it's just going to keep on going up for a while now )) 

315.17 318.67 A: yeah and that's and that's in a market today's market is down 

318.55 319.54 B: yeah 

318.97 320.72 A: and it's still going up 

320.11 321.38 B: yeah yeah 

320.96 326.96 A: yeah it's um they've got another movie coming out this summer and i think it'll still continue to go up until the movie comes out 

327.37 328.21 B: (( mm )) 

327.66 330.60 A: and it'll probably drop off a little bit 

329.84 330.66 B: (( mm )) 

331.45 335.27 A: let's see now i uh have one other thing i would change and that was uh 

331.56 332.43 B: (( right )) 

335.32 337.39 A: when i was nineteen 

337.57 343.14 A: i don't know about changes or not this is a good a good experience but i when i was nineteen i started a video arcade 

343.22 344.24 B: oh 

343.67 346.35 A: with a um high school buddy of mine 

347.07 352.52 A: and we lasted for [sigh] it lasted about six months before we uh we went under 

352.38 353.44 B: (( oh )) 

353.56 361.77 A: but you know that's one of those life experiences you know that that you probably get more out of it just by the experience of doin' it i lost about ten thousand dollars in that 

358.59 360.11 B: (( yeah well )) 

361.01 371.85 B: mm well if i go back much further i'm i'm fifty nine years old and if i go back to my childhood or not childhood i'd say teenage years or early twenties 

371.99 381.89 B: i would definitely change the fact that i for some reason and i would had have to figure what the reason was i didn't have any sexual experiences then and i would definitely want them [laughter] 

381.02 382.31 A: [laughter] 

382.11 394.68 B: 'cause i enjoy sex and i definitely missed out a lot so that's something i would definitely change [laughter] it's not exactly related to the money [laughter] thing but yeah hm 

383.52 384.44 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

395.47 400.79 A: well i don't even uh uh i'm forty one and i can't hardly even remember far that that far back 

400.82 403.08 B: oh yeah yeah [laughter] hm 

404.17 406.72 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah [sigh] i don't know )) 

407.03 410.13 A: i graduated high school in the nineteen eighties 

409.11 418.29 B: as far as the world situation goes i would definitely have to change a lot but uh i wouldn't have had control because we don't really have much control over our governments 

418.69 419.78 A: no we don't 

419.43 424.68 B: and i i my opinion i would have changed a lot of things that the u._s. did 

424.97 430.80 B: because the u._s. did so many things which brought such hatred toward it you know 

431.26 434.23 B: i think that would have changed the world today 

433.97 436.37 A: like what though what in what in particular 

435.66 441.67 B: well you know the the u._s. invaded other countries two hundred and seventy seven times did you know that 

441.25 442.88 A: two hundred and seventy no i didn't know 

442.46 450.66 B: yeah they [laughter] that's unbelievable and ac- actually it's two hundred seventy five if you don't include world wars one and two 

450.86 454.53 B: which i think were quite necessary yeah 

452.72 454.34 A: yeah 

454.74 458.96 B: i don't know it just left a lot of bad feelings i think 

459.67 461.82 B: from what i've read or heard you know 

462.29 464.01 A: yeah i don't really know why 

464.38 467.41 A: why they invaded the that many countries 

467.31 475.84 B: yeah oh they were all over the place south america central america yeah philippines of course in nineteen hundred 

475.93 480.72 B: [sigh] yeah yeah this goes back throughout the whole history but yeah 

480.92 484.12 B: [sigh] yeah so [sigh] oh boy 

485.31 492.89 B: so we all but we can't change the past so [laughter] that's why even though we might want to change that there's not much i can do 

492.95 502.80 A: oh yeah but you change if if you want to go back and change one little thing in history it would completely you know you don't [sigh] who knows what kind of a detrimental effect it would have 

493.02 494.87 B: i'm trying diff- what 

502.44 504.25 B: yeah that that 

503.37 507.18 A: very i mean there's a very tight balance in the world and it's 

506.82 510.28 B: that's true that's a good point yeah that that could be 

510.70 512.90 A: you know if we hadn't uh invaded 

513.79 514.56 A: uh 

514.60 518.85 A: panama or what whatever you know even though that might have been a bad thing to do 

519.45 522.67 A: it it could have had an effect that would have made been even worse 

523.22 525.89 B: (( yeah yeah maybe i don't know )) 

525.32 526.94 A: you know in future years 

529.74 536.23 B: [mn] maybe yeah i don't know it is true that everything is connected in some way that everything's yeah 

533.03 533.88 A: yep 

535.61 539.45 A: like that butterfly in japan that flaps its wings [mn] you ever heard that 

538.74 542.21 B: oh yeah that's right i heard of that yeah [laughter] [mn] 

543.22 546.31 B: (( that's a interesting idea yeah )) 

547.18 554.38 B: but um i i don't know now i now i'm trying all these different ways to make money now again you know i tried 

554.33 564.18 B: it's hopeless to go after the people the swindlers that took my money it's i i might try that one day but right now it's i'm trying positive things to try to make more money you know 

558.13 558.97 A: yeah 

564.84 568.61 B: but even those things a lot of them are schemes and things on the internet 

567.40 568.55 A: (( what are you trying )) 

568.62 570.27 B: well i'm uh 

570.36 579.81 B: [lipsmack] i'm into something which i can't even talk about but that might actually make a lot of money but that's uh just an investment in something but then there're all these programs on the internet do you do you ever 

580.22 582.74 B: do any of these programs on the internet 

582.13 584.29 A: well i see 'em all the time yeah 

583.68 584.93 B: (( yeah they're [mn] )) 

585.29 587.30 B: they're they're all based on 

588.24 596.21 B: the same general idea that there're going to be so many people doing it that you know each person in turn will get a lot of money at one point but 

596.76 598.11 B: (( i don't know )) 

597.57 599.89 A: well i'm not a big believer in multi level marketing
