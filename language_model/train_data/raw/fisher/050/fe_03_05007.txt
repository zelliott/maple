361.48 363.10 A: it was all i don't know 

363.63 374.65 A: it just it's so much politics and and religion and the biggest thing about it is it's just like why if if it's come on if you're using religion why i mean more people have died over religion 

374.27 375.25 B: right 

374.56 388.52 A: than in anything else in the world and i'm like why is it if if if every religion is supposed to be preaching this idea of love and and humanity and and caring for one another and of forgiveness why is everybody dying over it

456.80 457.93 B: (( mhm mm )) 

460.60 461.77 B: right

464.03 465.20 B: right 

467.10 468.18 B: mhm 

467.99 472.91 A: did you notice that uh for the first billion dollar contract was given to an american company yeah 

472.48 473.70 B: really 

473.98 474.91 B: hm 

474.66 485.61 A: that's just a growing g. seven country is actually canada not the u._s. and the u._s. dollar is actually going down while the canadian dollar is going up and the uh um 

478.63 479.38 B: hm 

482.70 484.05 B: mhm 

485.89 491.46 A: that's why i was i went to canada because there was more there was more chance for me getting a an i._t. position 

489.31 490.23 B: right 

491.47 492.44 A: um 

492.50 496.70 A: however as soon as i came over here almost an anti americanism everywhere 

496.47 497.62 B: really 

497.03 500.90 A: yeah you see there's there's two different factions it's more fifty fifty 

500.53 501.52 B: mhm 

501.39 504.05 A: there's a lot of canadians who love the states 

504.24 505.18 B: mhm 

504.47 511.60 A: and i would say actually the more the majority of them that love the states but as soon as the war came out like everybody was pro american 

509.11 509.96 B: mhm 

511.62 512.84 A: until the war 

512.56 513.66 B: really 

513.26 519.86 A: and then as soon as the war hit everybody i c- i mean haven't you noticed that the trade has significantly decreased 

519.19 520.69 B: mhm mhm 

520.94 525.46 A: that's that's b- that's a big thing uh it's it's the common denominator is 

525.62 530.49 A: where do we stand in this this war against terrorism and how is it gonna affect everybody i mean 

528.13 529.01 B: mhm 

530.84 533.77 A: what they don't realize is is that um 

534.12 537.45 A: by not uniting number one canada's getting poor 

537.29 538.57 B: yeah 

537.85 541.54 A: but the public relations of these states is getting worse 

541.17 542.08 B: right 

541.62 547.22 A: i'm i'm petrified to go in any other country [laughter] you know i'm like well i'm am- american and i'm like 

544.54 545.65 B: right 

547.82 549.07 B: right 

548.28 551.16 A: like number one i never go to france it's just [laughter] 

550.46 552.82 B: [laughter] 

551.99 554.71 A: if anything just say you're canadian and you'll be fine 

554.27 555.58 B: yeah 

554.86 558.26 A: it's and actually it is a g- it is a valid point but um 

558.60 560.07 A: i don't know i just um 

560.79 572.85 A: i don't know i just uh i i see so many i see i i see so many young people who are who have the right track but they're not voicing their opinions i mean the majority of people on your campus most likely are more open minded than any of your parents were 

567.03 568.24 B: mhm 

571.62 574.17 B: mhm yes oh definitely 

573.75 578.36 A: however they're they're not making any voices they're not yelling out they're not you know 

577.96 578.95 B: right 

578.38 584.85 A: voicing their opinions because they feel like it's an unempowered uh generation and uh i don't know i mean 

582.30 583.19 B: right 

585.89 591.94 A: if you if you did what you did with the um if if we if everybody gets together like they did with the clinton uh oh 

592.11 594.60 A: that was that's a whole story unto itself but um 

593.85 595.63 B: [laughter] 

594.74 599.95 A: if people start registering the vote and actually voicing their opinions you will see that people will start to 

598.17 599.19 B: mhm
