256.91 263.82 A: uh that but i didn't i didn't i didn't have much desire to go there before the nine eleven and after it i'd have even less you know 

261.81 262.51 B: (( oh )) 

263.62 265.14 B: true true mhm mhm 

265.18 266.97 A: [laughter] [laughter] although

279.28 280.81 A: (( yeah right [mn] )) 

280.41 281.46 B: (( so [noise] but um )) 

281.55 291.59 B: uh actually uh uh i know it was a terrible thing and we felt bad but we didn't let it affect our life because a- basically there was nothing we could do 

282.32 283.31 A: (( um )) 

291.71 296.02 A: right nothing that anybody could do after it happened to speak of other than 

292.36 293.36 B: (( so mhm [noise] )) 

296.14 304.00 A: if you lived in the new york area you could help clean it up i guess you know it was a terrible disaster but uh certainly not uh 

301.64 303.12 B: yeah mm yes it uh-huh 

304.53 310.51 A: uh and and and and i i have a tough time understanding how people could even do the things that they did you know i 

309.77 310.57 B: oh 

310.55 313.55 A: uh suicide bombers i mean that's 

312.38 314.92 B: oh i i can't understand that either 

313.71 323.88 A: that's a tough thing to you know but uh their their uh beliefs and and uh things are different than uh m- most of the people that live in this country so 

323.16 331.90 B: oh that's right and you don't really appreciate this country till you have gone overseas and seen some of those um uh conditions of uh 

331.97 343.25 A: but i think i think it would have i think it actually uh i feel better about trying to do my normal things that we were doing a- were planning to do as much as we could anyway but that tha- to 

332.05 333.46 B: the world over there 

343.93 346.99 A: that was the one thing i forgot about when we first started talking was 

347.00 353.05 A: we have to ha- we did postpone our trip but it wasn't even uh [lipsmack] something that um 

353.20 354.71 A: that we could uh 

354.88 357.65 A: really be sure we were going to be able to get over there you know so 

357.04 358.38 B: mhm mhm 

358.66 364.05 B: oh well do you find out that uh maybe it uh gave you more faith in um 

364.22 369.27 B: in uh the lord and then maybe faith in our country 

369.68 374.71 A: well [laughter] yeah i think so yeah yeah uh 

372.19 373.05 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

375.01 378.96 A: [laughter] i've uh uh i just uh [noise] you know 

379.05 383.70 A: i'm glad that we went in there and took care of mister saddam hussein too 

383.00 385.79 B: oh i am too yes i think he's 

385.07 389.23 A: i'm not uh at first i was a little bit conc- i didn't really want to see 

389.35 394.09 A: a lot of innocent people get killed and even any military people get killed but 

393.39 394.92 B: (( yes mhm true uh-huh )) 

394.64 395.76 A: (( they uh )) 

395.83 396.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

396.42 397.38 A: they did a 

397.40 403.50 A: they did it pretty efficiently considering the task you know 

402.82 404.74 B: yes yes it was a 

403.85 405.19 A: and uh 

405.23 412.03 A: [noise] it surprised it i- it didn't surprise me as much as it uh i expected it to take a little bit longer 

412.02 415.13 B: well i i yeah 

413.20 414.52 A: (( [laughter] but uh you know )) 

414.66 420.74 A: it didn't and that's good it's still dangerous over there though it's not a very safe place to be

427.22 427.95 B: [noise] 

431.76 433.42 B: (( yes right right )) 

433.49 436.39 A: is going to take some time i'm afraid 

434.92 449.66 B: mhm it's oh it will take time and it affects so much to see them so ungrateful to the united states for coming or the united nations but basically the united states did most of it uh to see them 

449.96 456.49 B: to see certain people and want them to leave and to and to be killing our 

456.67 460.21 B: the soldiers and [noise] servicemen that are there

460.82 462.54 A: right 

464.54 473.62 A: yeah it's very dangerous it's a very dangerous place to be because these people are are just sitting around some of them are just sitting around waiting to try to kill somebody you know 

465.76 466.74 B: mhm 

466.82 468.19 B: (( very dangerous mhm ))
