32.29 33.29 A: mhm 

33.95 37.08 A: (( oh because you have to go to work walking is that why [noise] [noise] )) 

36.83 42.71 B: right but i don't i don't do um you know very much regimented exercise 

42.58 43.65 A: okay 

44.94 46.04 B: what about you 

45.31 56.03 A: [lipsmack] well i- it's i recently moved and uh i live in los angeles and i just moved to downtown i don't know what [noise] city you're calling from where you are but [mn] um where 

54.14 55.06 B: (( philadelph- )) 

56.16 57.44 B: philadelphia 

57.27 58.39 A: oh okay 

58.41 70.76 A: um so here in l._a. you need a car to go anywhere but [sigh] i moved to downtown and [noise] they're restoring these old buildings but one of the problems is that [noise] very few of them have parking [sigh] so you have to park like two or three [laughter] blocks away 

70.73 74.23 A: [noise] so i live on seventh street and my parking lot is on third street 

74.39 84.34 A: a couple of blocks over so i have to walk about seven blocks every day to get to my car [noise] and to get to my place [mn] 'cause that's the closest parking lot that had a parking space so i 

84.06 84.93 B: (( oh )) 

84.66 91.39 A: consider that exercising because i have to walk at least fifteen blocks every day [noise] every time i wanna go out so 

90.87 93.46 B: that's your apartment building doesn't have parking 

93.37 103.45 A: yeah yeah because it's weird like these buildings were built here in like [noise] at the turn of the century so [sigh] back then they had like street cars and [noise] subways and whatever else they had back then 

103.87 107.82 A: um somehow they i know [laughter] but uh 

104.07 105.09 B: (( that's is )) 

106.83 108.25 B: it a big building 

108.21 112.08 A: [mn] it's uh fourteen floors fifteen fifteen floors 

112.10 114.90 B: wow so that's meant a lot of units there i guess 

115.06 120.17 A: [noise] [noise] yeah it's about like five hundred i think 'cause they're all like single apartments 

120.95 122.11 B: wow 

121.03 134.68 A: [noise] um so it's but we i do a lot of exercising plus sometimes if i don't think i've had enough i mean in that sense like you i don't like i don't know if you do it but i don't like go to the gym or an- or do weightlifting or any training like that 

134.10 135.62 B: yeah i never do that 

135.14 141.71 A: [mn] [noise] i figure just walking from [noise] my place to my car and then back is enough for the day [mn] 

141.57 149.54 B: yeah but i'm in i'm in real good shape though physically like i mean i'm i'm five eleven but i only weigh about a hundred and fifty five pounds 

141.97 142.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

144.70 145.55 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

149.00 150.45 A: [sigh] oh wow 

151.20 152.34 B: so like i'm 

151.33 154.07 A: yeah that's that's pretty good [noise] 

153.04 157.46 B: i'm all muscular i just have good uh genes i guess good metabolism 

157.36 158.27 A: oh 

158.85 169.65 A: see if i didn't at least do that [sigh] 'cause i if i eat something i kn- you you know it'll be on me still four days later you can tell i ate too much whatever 'cause i'm really [mn] i'm about five seven [noise] 

169.48 181.20 A: [lipsmack] but i'm a hundred and eighty so i'm a little bit husky [sigh] and i know if i don't walk you know seven blocks a day [laughter] i would weigh about two fifty by now [laughter] and uh 

173.27 174.44 B: not bad 

178.52 184.27 B: i know right yeah i can eat anything and i won't gain weight you know 

183.57 187.82 A: see that's not fair but [lipsmack] life isn't fair sometimes 

187.47 190.60 B: [laughter] yeah my girlfriend doesn't like that 

188.68 190.17 A: (( um )) 

190.54 195.07 A: another thing that i do also sometimes just just to keep up i guess 

195.03 207.77 A: uh i instead of taking the elevator if i don't have anything to carry up i'll come on the stairs up to the 'cause i'm on the twelfth floor [sigh] so i'll i'll walk up to the twelfth floor and i consider that my exercise too for the day [noise] 

208.10 209.36 B: oh that's good 

209.08 215.66 A: that's if i really have a lot of energy which is probably like you know every other day or something [mn] i'll take the stairs up [sigh] 

216.69 222.05 A: or if we have no other choice like like the elevator is not working then we all have to exercise i guess 

221.76 223.44 B: right you have no choice 

223.13 224.15 A: [laughter] 

224.20 224.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

224.42 226.94 B: well walking up the stairs is hard on your knees 

227.85 231.77 A: [sigh] you know i remember when i was um 'cause i used to run 

231.77 246.59 A: um i i used to do track and field i did it for about five years [sigh] and it it really like gets your metabolism going if you do it like every day i remember that much [noise] [sigh] but i remember like i always had like [noise] pain you know on my knees in my joints 

246.43 254.24 A: [noise] uh the bottom of my feet and so i i did it for about five or six years and then i stopped because it was too much injuries [noise] [sigh] so i just gave it up [noise] 

254.84 258.56 B: yeah i mean that kind of activity's pretty hard on your joints a 

254.94 255.71 A: (( [mn] )) 

259.83 262.62 B: lot of a lot of runners get arthritis you know 

259.86 261.49 A: and 

262.29 265.08 A: [noise] just from the exercising [noise] 

264.90 265.84 B: well you know from 

265.22 268.97 A: just fr- just from the running i mean yeah

272.68 276.26 B: yeah like joggers they get a lot of arthritis in the knees 

277.10 284.67 A: [noise] [noise] well that's [noise] interesting i never knew that [noise] you could from that i know that you get injuries yeah [noise] oh wow 

279.91 282.61 B: your heart might not wear out but your knees will 

285.31 287.25 A: [mn] but um 

286.28 288.92 B: that's another excuse not to exercise [laughter] 

289.81 297.55 A: [laughter] well some of us have to or else [laughter] we're in a lot more trouble than a hurt knee you know [laughter] 

297.59 301.02 B: well now with the summer coming you've gotta get into shape to go to the 

297.66 298.41 A: (( [sigh] )) 

300.35 309.77 A: yeah yeah [sigh] um but there is um i notice though that a lot of people here in the building they do have like [sigh] um 

309.54 319.38 A: 'cause we can see everybody w- walking downstairs or you know taking the elevator downstairs 'cause we have a gym we actually have two gyms within like four blocks like me- like we have a bally's and a golds gym 

319.36 329.57 A: and uh and you can see like everybody in the building um 'cause they're open like until two in the morning i think [sigh] all with their little bags and their towels around their necks and they go exercise 

329.84 330.72 B: really 

330.06 341.78 A: [sigh] but i i think it's also more like a show that they have a gym membership than anything else 'cause i don't know how long they take and what they do there but i know it's a big show when they go there and when they come back you know [sigh] it's like 

339.69 343.94 B: yeah a lot of people wanna just show other people that they're going to the gym 

343.62 347.47 A: [laughter] and then they come out drinking their little slim fast shakes 

347.94 350.57 A: well it's crazy 

349.60 352.86 B: oh well that's better than coming out smoking a cigarette i 

352.31 357.95 A: (( yeah well some do some do actually [laughter] )) 

354.24 355.99 B: know you see that 

356.58 360.12 B: i i see people do that all the time i think it's so stupid 

359.72 369.62 A: [laughter] and you should see with all this smog that we have right in downtown [lipsmack] you don't need to smoke a cigarette all you need is to take a full couple of deep breaths and you're you have it for the day [laughter]

473.75 474.85 B: oh okay 

474.72 484.03 A: you can actually like hike all the way you know from one side go up it and then go down to the other side of the san fernando valley in like 

484.35 486.14 A: five hours at the most 

486.54 487.98 B: oh that's not a lot 

488.13 490.19 A: no it's it's a very small hill 

490.67 494.62 B: now the valley is that like um the bad part of l._a. 

495.31 501.72 A: [mn] uh it san fernando valley mm not really south l._a. is

504.57 505.90 B: oh yeah that's true 

507.23 519.92 A: but i guess you could walk there and then you know if you got caught in the wrong neighborhood you [laughter] you better pray and that yeah exactly [laughter] you better pray that you have strong legs [laughter] to run out of the neighborhood [laughter] 

511.52 513.42 B: have to run away right 

518.68 524.60 B: that's the thing like i've got really strong legs but i don't work out my ack- upper body so i'm not really 

523.56 525.05 A: mhm 

524.63 526.88 B: don't really have a strong upper body 

526.37 526.93 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

527.69 533.89 A: um i you know i ca- yeah the fatter i used to when i first moved into the building i used to 

533.96 541.29 A: you know by the eighth floor i'd have to like stop and take a little bit of a break 'cause i was like all winded and out of breath like my goodness 

542.15 555.80 A: like especially if i had something like the laundry is downstairs in the basement [sigh] so you have to carry stuff up or down and then you know sometimes like yesterday uh or the day before actually on sun- sunday 'cause 

556.30 559.18 A: somebody died in the building i don't what they 

559.09 573.05 A: they were picking up the body so everybody was coming up and down the s- the stairs and i was just like i just kept passing people and people were just like sitting you know on the landings because they couldn't [lipsmack] go any more and i'm thinking that's actually i got thinking man are we just out of shape in this [noise] 

573.39 576.43 A: city i mean people just can't go anywhere 

576.22 581.85 B: well plus since they drive all everywhere and they don't walk that's also gonna contribute 

578.47 581.58 A: [lipsmack] yeah yeah see 

581.76 592.93 A: see here in l._a. you're really actually the transit public transportation is getting better but you really need a car to get around um if you have like different places to go throughout the day 

592.86 598.84 A: [noise] but um [noise] you know actually i've been walking a lot lately because like i said my car is about seven blocks away 

599.00 599.95 A: so some things you
