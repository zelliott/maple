17.91 30.11 B: well the i had my third call um [lipsmack] not too long ago and and it went right up to the time i was supposed to say hello and i was cut off and i never heard back so i called in tonight also to get my third call in 

29.83 30.89 A: oh okay 

30.72 33.64 B: so do you reg- do you exercise regularly 

33.54 44.06 A: uh semi regularly i i try to and it's difficult i i don't like like going to a gym and doing things like a treadmill you know i like doing exercise that's fun you know more like tennis 

44.51 51.21 A: or bicycling but i go through long stretches where i don't get much exercise and i feel worse for it 

50.63 56.14 B: yeah me too i'm not i'm not extremely athletic so the [noise] only um [laughter] [mn] 

56.77 57.77 B: i 

58.65 67.73 B: i've given up joining gyms because i waste more money that way but i really i enjoy walking if i can find a place that i like the surroundings 

68.03 70.54 B: and or i feel safe in san diego 

70.48 75.05 A: yeah oh yeah that's it's m- it's more difficult for a woman in a city too 

70.64 72.27 B: (( [laughter] um )) 

74.83 76.26 B: yeah um 

76.35 84.60 B: [noise] actually i live a little bit out of the city right now and it's it's pretty nice out here i'm on the golf course but basically i just really hate 

84.87 89.38 B: i hate exercise and i wish that but i'm always i'm always 

89.97 93.24 B: trying to to do it because i'm always fighting weight 

93.57 94.37 A: oh 

95.00 98.17 A: yeah i've gradually put on weight over the years 

97.85 98.96 B: how old are you 

98.26 100.08 A: kind of like forty seven 

100.16 104.59 B: i'm i'm a little bit older than you but yeah i find that every year it's a little bit harder 

104.64 112.94 A: uh yeah like i've just read a book that's that looks really promising about the whole well the whole issue of like how people eat and exercise to regulate their moods 

113.00 117.86 A: and it covers a lot of stuff that usually isn't covered in these books it's the opposite of a fad diet book 

117.94 119.63 B: i think it definitely 

119.65 128.01 B: it definitely does make a difference on how you feel psychologically i think it has a big effect on on women in particular [noise] because the hormones 

129.46 133.85 A: yeah 'cause i feel better sometimes when i've exercised pretty vigorously you know i feel 

134.07 135.37 A: alive 

135.63 139.30 A: and i i wish i'd remember that when i'm sitting at the computer 

139.00 140.00 B: [laughter] 

140.04 144.22 B: the computer hasn't helped any of us over the years really i mean [noise] 

142.63 156.65 A: oh i know i know actually now i i've been going out with a woman recently like for about the last month and a half and she has a dog and so often she has to run off to work and i have time so i walk the dog so that's some exercise 

155.13 161.80 B: [sigh] i have to say i i have to say that [mn] [sigh] i don't have a dog right now but when i did have a dog 

162.02 169.20 B: it it made a big difference because i i didn't i won't do it for me but [sigh] [noise] just like you said you do it for the animal 

168.81 170.51 A: mhm yeah you have to [noise] 

169.22 172.66 B: it really forces you to do that that's it's a real good 

172.67 174.66 B: good way for people to 

174.94 176.60 B: [noise] to make themselves 

176.80 178.16 B: be consistent 

178.93 179.93 B: (( [noise] )) 

180.55 185.51 B: i guess in the long run it's kind of [noise] expensive though [laughter] [noise] yeah 

183.53 194.00 A: having a dog well it's there's a lot of intangible benefits but yeah there is there is a fair amount of money especially if you you know you have to do you know you don't do any of the veterinary work yourself or whatever yeah 

193.47 207.93 B: [noise] and i think one problem in that too is that as you get older i think it's harder for older people to have animals and to take care of them and and those are the really the people that need to be stimulated to go out and do something so i don't know it's kind of a catch twenty two situation 

207.57 215.96 A: yeah it may be partly too that people are more isolated i mean people used to i think live in groups more and now everyone has their own apartments it seems 

215.64 216.56 B: right 

217.17 218.39 B: (( [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

217.59 220.11 A: do y- are there any sports that you like at all mhm 

220.64 222.62 B: y- you know [sigh] 

222.68 231.62 B: i'm just not uh competitive at all i do like golf [noise] but my husband's really competitive and and that makes it [noise] difficult 

231.10 235.25 A: yeah if you're at if you're at way different levels it makes it a little difficult [laughter] 

231.63 232.76 B: um 

233.84 239.45 B: right he's he's really good and and i've been a beginner for the last fifteen years 

239.64 244.98 B: [laughter] i'll start for you know a few months when it when the weather gets nice and then i just 

245.46 251.65 B: [noise] if you wonder what that squeaking is that's my [noise] bird [laughter] she hasn't gotten enough attention today [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

248.07 249.40 A: oh okay 

251.78 258.38 A: yeah no golf for me has always been a strange sport 'cause i've only done it a few times and the times i've done it it's always rained 

259.09 266.37 A: and it's not like it rains that much here but it's just every time i go golfing you know some it's it's on someone else's impetus like one time it was for a company picnic 

266.42 269.28 A: and one time it was a friend just said oh let's go to the golf course 

269.51 276.04 B: [sigh] [noise] well i i don't really think that's the type of exercise that people need anyway i mean i 

276.33 285.72 B: if i did play i would walk because the whole for me the whole point of being out there is the beauty of the [noise] course [mn] golf courses 

285.83 288.98 B: pretty much are pretty pleasant places to be 

288.58 289.90 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

289.29 291.93 B: and i can't see riding in a cart um 

292.37 294.01 B: [lipsmack] i [sigh] 

294.14 298.75 B: it's just not the cardio vascular kind of exercise that you really need 

294.45 296.06 A: no no it makes no sense 

299.00 300.08 B: um 

300.29 309.96 B: [noise] i don't know i picked up a tape today um my daughter said it was really great it's uh you've probably heard it advertised it's the [noise] um [lipsmack] walking 

310.49 314.87 B: [noise] to fitness you can get the one mile tape two mile tape three mile 

315.65 317.72 A: no i don't think i've heard of that 

317.20 322.51 B: [noise] [noise] well i'm gonna check it out she says it's really good you can do it in you know [noise] about a half hour 

318.60 319.65 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

322.56 323.32 B: for 

323.50 326.00 B: i think it's twenty minutes [noise] for the two mile 

326.49 328.82 B: so that's that's pretty good pace 

329.22 333.64 B: um i'll see if that works [noise] yeah [noise] 

330.73 334.26 A: twenty minutes for two miles that's quite fast yeah mhm 

334.91 338.04 B: i think she said it was twenty minutes it was either twenty minutes or [lipsmack] 

338.17 339.98 B: it was under a half hour i know 

340.72 342.78 B: so it's it's like 

343.66 353.93 B: [noise] [sigh] i don't i don't think it's real tough aerobics but i know that you work up to it [noise] and then if you can put [noise] in a half hour a day you're doing pretty good 

354.07 357.39 B: i joined cur- have you do you have a curves back there 

356.70 358.39 A: yeah they're all over here 

358.08 362.78 B: well i joined that and and i did that for [laughter] actually six months 

362.94 368.73 B: [noise] and didn't gain anything um but didn't [noise] really lose anything either and didn't [noise] [sigh] 

370.28 373.78 B: it just wasn't what i was looking for i i just keep looking 

373.97 374.90 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

374.22 378.49 B: i mean i'm not [sigh] i'm about twenty twenty pounds overweight and i just keep 

378.63 381.66 B: [sigh] i have to keep on it constantly because 

381.69 384.69 B: as i get older it's tougher and tougher to get it off 

385.31 386.33 B: um 

388.48 395.71 B: [noise] i've started atkins and and so now i just have to [noise] find something this summer to do i think we're all searching 

395.95 399.25 B: except for those people that just absolutely are are 

399.85 404.93 B: [noise] hooked on that adrenalin rush and i've just never gotten that [noise] 'cause 

404.10 409.76 A: yeah you see well some people will like a sport a lot and do it and have people they do it with like you know something like racquet ball let's say 

407.57 409.40 B: (( right )) 

410.09 411.49 B: have you ever done that 

411.15 419.77 A: no i like tennis but i don't have too many people i can play tennis with but if i can find people then i'll i'll do it because i actually enjoy it 

420.43 430.69 A: and i'm not i'm not great at it but i'm not bad at it and i also find it's good for my back the side to side motion you know j- jumping on one foot and the other kind of loosens my back up 

426.61 428.04 B: (( [noise] [noise] right [mn] )) 

431.45 433.37 A: so i found that to be helpful what trying 

434.29 439.22 A: to think of something else i was going to say and now i can't remember well there was i also found one book 

438.99 449.35 A: 'cause someone had men- someone had mentioned it on the internet it's actually kind of old it's about thirty years old but it was done by one of the doctors who was trying to figure out how much exercise the astronauts would need in space 

449.84 454.84 A: and the title of the book is kind of encouraging 'cause it's called total fitness in thirty minutes a week 

455.74 461.50 A: [lipsmack] but the thirty minutes i think are fairly vigorous the idea is to get your heart rate up past a certain level 

462.32 466.21 B: [noise] [lipsmack] have have you heard of the little uh publication called bottom line 

466.41 471.65 A: no that d- oh wait that's that's the one where it's like lots of like insider kind of things 

471.21 472.29 B: (( [noise] um )) 

471.97 474.29 A: i'm thinking of i may be thinking of a different one 

473.91 479.06 B: well they have it for for all different kinds of things i think they have one for office people and [noise] 

479.11 481.36 B: um my husband gets it because 

481.48 482.86 B: [noise] i don't 

482.83 490.55 B: know [sigh] i don't know how he got started but at any rate they have like really really short little articles and just [noise] just really great pointers and 

490.44 498.55 B: [lipsmack] and just recently i read one that has [sigh] a whole list of exercises that you do really really slow 

498.14 500.98 A: mhm mm that sounds familiar 

498.69 500.24 B: (( and )) 

500.39 508.60 B: it's supposed to be as much as like a two hour work out in like twenty minutes or something [laughter] i look for the short term 

508.78 518.89 A: i think i h- i think i read about that in there's a there's a doctor named andrew wile who is like an alternat- he does a thing called integrated medicine i think someone asked him about it and he started describing it it just 

509.16 510.32 B: [noise] 

518.86 522.93 B: [noise] it it's supposed to be as good as as a total workout 

522.38 527.41 A: does yeah so but i don't does it leave you with that feeling though like being tired but in a good way 

527.62 531.83 B: but there again i don't think that does cardio vascular uh i mean doesn't do any 

530.36 535.10 A: yeah so so it might develop muscles the other oh that's right 'cause you were saying about 

535.23 545.85 A: like you went to curves and you don't feel like you gai- you didn't gain any weight but you didn't lose any but partly a lot of that when you do exercise is you end up replacing a certain amount of body fat with muscle 

545.89 547.74 B: that's what they say 

546.97 549.95 A: which is denser and so it actually weighs more 

548.84 549.92 B: [noise] 

551.03 555.17 B: they have a little machine that they test though and i wasn't seeing any results there [laughter] 

554.38 562.08 A: oh so the your fat percentage was staying the same well your but your fat percentage is probably not that bad i mean twenty pounds overweight isn't vast amount 

556.08 557.49 B: yeah 

562.54 565.57 B: i've been trying to lose that twenty pounds for the last twenty years 

564.93 566.24 A: okay [laughter] 

565.65 566.94 B: [laughter] 

566.52 569.44 A: well but it's but you've stayed stable though for twenty years 

569.43 575.02 B: um i i just lose the same you know i'll lose ten and get it back and 

573.58 574.85 A: mhm 

576.36 578.01 B: (( i don't know it's difficult )) 

576.98 583.81 A: but do you ha- is there a particular is there a particular food that you think is particular you particularly over indulge in 

584.77 587.29 B: not since i started atkins that's for sure 

587.08 589.14 A: what did you say acting 

588.59 590.90 B: at- atkins a. t. k. 

590.06 592.17 A: oh oh at- the atkins diet 

591.56 599.89 B: right i mean it i just started that a couple of months ago and it goes against everything that i've ever done in my life so it's really difficult to switch from everything low fat 

592.40 593.46 A: (( oh yeah ))
