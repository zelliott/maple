36.69 38.31 A: oh [laughter] okay 

37.29 43.45 B: [laughter] okay so what do you think about the strike of the um athletic 

43.50 45.26 A: well um 

45.40 49.76 A: you know my- myself i'm i'm yeah i am a sports fan i i do follow 

49.88 52.23 A: uh sports um 

52.49 57.13 A: uh i w- i would say on a fairly regular basis and um 

57.84 63.33 A: [mn] you know my uh i would say what a year is uh even though i i'm i'm still a sports fan 

63.49 69.41 A: uh you know i've i don't know i've become a l- a little impatient um 

69.63 75.31 A: you know with strikes uh with you know with with professional athletes um you know who strike 

75.80 79.60 B: i agree with you i think they're getting too much money already 

79.66 86.40 A: yeah i mean they had they are they are getting a lot of money i mean how m- how mu- i mean how much do you need and [sigh] you know and to me they're i don't 

86.20 95.86 A: you know they're ask the question do [sigh] professional athletes deserve that that much money i g- i guess in in a society where we we play we put emphasis you know i've often 

95.77 109.36 A: heard people say well you know uh doctors and tea- well teachers should be paid that much you know and that that may be true but in this society we we put a lot of emphasis on you know entertainment so i guess you know they [laughter] may as well 

109.28 120.97 A: get as much as uh you know that society you know is willing to pay them so but yeah i mean for me to me a professional athletes' strike is is is ridiculous 

120.57 133.73 B: [sigh] uh i y- i agree with you [sigh] and whenever they get a higher salary that means they raise the price of the tickets for the people that go there and um it's i think it's just unreasonable [mn] 

127.74 129.10 A: yeah that's right 

133.05 134.68 A: well you know it's um 

134.96 140.29 A: uh i i i occasionally get to a f- an eagles game occasionally um 

140.72 142.95 A: but i i have a friend um 

143.06 152.62 A: who up until this season uh up until last season uh he had a season ticket but he had to give away his season ticket um 

152.56 158.12 A: because the eagles you know they're d- they're moving into a new park and um 

156.73 157.63 B: mhm 

158.14 161.96 A: this this uh they wanna be in a new park this upcoming season 

161.94 174.73 A: and he was he was priced out he he he didn't think he he could do it but it would be at the expense of a lot of other things and he just he just sat down he thought hard and he just said hey you know 

174.74 177.25 A: um he didn't think it was 

177.71 184.09 A: you know getting a season tickets at the expense of other things was was worth it you know uh so 

183.15 185.24 B: i can understand that uh-huh mm 

184.56 189.54 A: yeah i mean it's it's i mean the prices are just getting outrageous um 

189.83 198.61 A: you know i- i- you know y- you can't take a you know a family of four any more uh like you could you know maybe fifteen twenty years ago i mean they've 

198.46 206.14 A: gotten to the point now where where the common person is has been priced out of uh priced out of going to sporting events now now the st- you 

206.15 212.85 A: know the luxury boxes uh now all the people you'll see you know are you know the corporate you know 

212.36 213.80 B: right uh-huh 

213.18 214.65 A: yeah 

214.04 223.96 B: that that's true [sigh] um both my husband and um our boys are really fans of football especially and 

224.05 226.68 B: um therefore i am too but 

227.46 228.54 B: in fact 

227.53 228.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

228.62 233.54 B: we enjoy watching college football better than the professionals 

232.90 234.26 A: mhm 

233.62 243.07 B: and um basically because they've made such a a business out of being a professional and which i know it is to the players but 

243.05 251.23 B: their salary is already so outrageous that i can't comprehend them wanting more 

251.26 256.47 B: because [mn] never in our lifetime would we make that much money [mn] 

256.05 259.19 A: well i remember i remember the the last um 

259.56 266.97 A: work uh work stoppage in baseball and some of the comments from some of the athletes i forget who it was but one of the athletes 

267.06 275.36 A: [laughter] had to talk he talked about uh he had the he had to provide for his family i mean my god how m- how much do you need to provide for your 

275.12 277.45 B: [mn] right right 

275.49 279.49 A: (( family [laughter] [laughter] i mean wow i mean come on )) 

279.23 280.30 B: yeah 

279.89 292.70 A: you know and this and this athlete is i remember wh- he was you know one of the more highly paid ones i mean my god come on i mean how much do you need but you know yeah i mean i don't you know it's um [mn] 

285.51 286.14 B: (( mm )) 

287.07 287.65 B: [mn] 

288.45 289.70 B: yeah that 

292.88 301.41 A: you know it's uh i mean y- i you know i mean i'm thirty six years old and like i say i've been a sports fan since i you know since i was a you know small boy 

300.33 301.20 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

301.50 310.06 A: but it y- even though i'm still a sports fan i and i still follow sports regularly it just i don't know it just doesn't seem the same any more it it 

309.85 323.93 A: seemed to me uh when i was growing up uh that the athletes really liked to play yeah they m- yeah they made even a nice penny even back then but it seemed to me that they enjoyed the game you know for the game itself i mean that they really enjoy playing 

321.01 321.75 B: (( yeah )) 

322.07 323.11 B: that's true 

323.84 330.47 B: and um if i remember right i'm seventy two years old [laughter] so if i remember right 

330.54 331.30 B: you 

331.35 338.41 B: people looked up to the players as a role model especially the younger uh younger boys you know 

333.44 334.37 A: right 

334.53 335.41 A: yeah 

338.02 339.22 A: mhm 

338.60 350.30 B: yeah they looked up to them now i know the uh players have an agent they have to pay them so much and there's some upkeep but really as you say how much does it take 

345.18 346.16 A: right 

350.36 353.19 B: [mn] to do all that and to take care of your family 

352.60 363.97 A: right i mean take care of your family i mean come on i mean how m- how m- how much do you need i mean uh players yet they just don't seem to be as uh accessible today as they once were um 

363.98 365.87 A: they're not as friendly 

366.18 378.57 A: um you know when i was growing up my i- i got to meet my idol my idol growing up was matter of fact he wasn't he wasn't a t- yo- p- an athlete that played for a team sport he was um he was uh mohammed ali 

378.35 379.78 B: oh yeah 

379.19 390.48 A: and i got to meet mohammed ali when i was uh twelve years old i mean that was you know uh that was i mean a dream come true i mean he was yeah 

382.98 384.48 B: you did 

388.31 389.86 B: (( well yeah )) 

389.87 390.97 B: mhm 

391.09 397.52 A: so but the players today they they're just just not as friendly they just um [mn] they're standoffish um 

397.91 404.40 A: you know they they just uh they just don't enjoy it it seems to be all about the money that's what it seems to be about 

402.86 405.91 B: um i agree with you mhm mhm mhm 

406.67 412.20 A: you know and uh you know i've um i'm i've never been you know one of these people you know that have [mn] you 

412.40 420.38 A: know been you know autograph hounds i i i'm not into getting autographs from players but i you know i've had occasion you know to have you know to run into uh 

420.15 431.02 A: you know some athletes every once in a while at at you know different places and yeah i'd go up to 'em and you know shake their hand and stuff like that and i remember meeting mohammed ali and i mean he 

430.78 444.47 A: i mean here w- here was i this twelve year old boy he was you know mohammed ali this was still when he was at the height of his i mean popularity and this man was just standing there just talking to everybody i mean he held babies in his arm 

438.21 439.42 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

444.23 454.23 A: i mean kissing women i mean he w- he w- he was just he was just ama- and this was the man who was you know at that time probably the most popular man in the world at that time you know 

453.39 455.99 B: at that time right uh mhm 

454.46 465.52 A: yeah i mean he was just i mean people were just walking up to him and just they were just talking to him like you know he was just having a conversation with them but today you w- you meet an athlete you you 

462.01 463.09 B: mhm 

465.35 475.80 A: know they they you know you shake their hand and you know sort of like you know [laughter] they you know y- y- y- you know they barely touch your hand they you know barely want to look you in the eye so um 

475.44 476.34 B: right 

476.35 477.09 B: uh 

476.46 477.77 A: yeah 

477.20 486.65 B: besides being paid for playing well then they do all these commercials they get uh um money for 

483.14 484.19 A: right 

486.25 487.64 A: mhm sure 

486.73 494.85 B: and um sometimes that fee is just outrageous too so on top of their salary as a player 

494.28 496.32 A: right they get all these endorsement 

495.79 498.23 B: right yeah mhm 

496.48 503.73 A: right e- e- exactly on th- yeah on the you're right on on top of their salary they get all this endorsement money you know when they do these commercials so [sigh] 

503.92 508.98 A: i mean to me there's there's never a reason for a professional athlete uh to strike i mean they should be 

509.07 521.26 A: you know thankful for every penny that they they get yes they they work hard and have to learn a skill you know yes they did that's that's true but to strike i mean to me it's ridiculous 

516.88 517.64 B: (( yeah )) 

519.55 520.59 B: well when 

520.82 528.27 B: when they strike well then they put all the people that depend on their playing out of work 

527.65 528.67 A: sure 

528.91 535.19 A: like the uh you know the people who work at the the park and things like that and yeah so you know 

533.26 536.46 B: yeah and keep the field up and all that stuff uh-huh 

536.09 542.30 A: yeah i mean uh but yeah i think there's a lot of today a lot of selfishness among uh professional athletes [mn] 

540.86 545.22 B: that's it they're selfish um a- 'course there are a few 

544.94 548.33 A: right yeah there are there are some exceptions i mean there are there are 

548.31 562.89 A: some exceptions who do seem to appreciate you know what they have and you know who are um g- gracious and who who do seem to like the love the game for the game so yeah there there are there are some exceptions but uh i don't know th- 

558.43 559.10 B: (( mm mm )) 

562.95 564.74 A: not many these days [mn] 

564.41 573.50 B: no there aren't and when they strike as i said they put all these other people out of work that need that money to to take care of their family 

574.12 575.14 B: so [noise] 

576.25 578.05 A: yeah so it's um [sigh] 

578.54 584.13 A: yeah i- it- it- it's it's ridiculous for uh an athlete to strike i mean i just um [mn] 

584.47 593.37 A: you know i don't know some- sometimes i look at sports and you know i i it's not wh- e- even though i'm a sports fan i i i think one of the things that's 

593.26 599.95 A: wrong with sports is that i think it's you know with with e._s._p._n. and you know e._s._p._n. two and all the sports networks on now
