83.87 84.78 A: uh-huh 

86.75 87.94 A: i see 

87.27 90.66 B: so i'm on the fencing team and um 

90.20 92.36 A: on the fencing team oh great 

90.92 92.00 B: (( yep )) 

92.11 93.43 B: and um 

93.59 97.46 B: i'm not that good at it but my team mates are really good at it and um 

96.24 97.06 A: uh-huh 

98.11 105.33 B: last april we went down to florida for the club collegiate championships and we won 

105.27 107.47 A: mm good congratulations 

105.69 106.78 B: so 

106.79 111.85 B: yeah thank you and that was that was kind of fun and i really enjoy that 

111.59 112.51 A: uh-huh 

111.98 120.21 B: not entirely because um i'm really busy at other with school and i feel like if i could focus on that more i would enjoy it more 

119.76 120.71 A: sure 

120.31 121.18 B: but 

121.43 128.35 B: and in my spare time i like i don't know i like to dance instead i like modern dancing and like 

128.41 129.89 B: taking ballet 

129.66 130.57 A: uh-huh 

130.11 134.11 B: and i think that's just more interesting than going out for a run 

133.88 136.01 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

134.28 140.67 B: [sigh] so [lipsmack] but i'm kind of in between right now because i just gone done with school and i have a lot of like 

140.94 144.79 B: administrative stuff that i'm doing for myself and i haven't had the chance 

144.85 145.81 B: so 

145.95 147.20 A: sure 

146.61 147.58 B: anyway 

147.81 148.95 B: yeah 

148.38 159.16 A: okay well that's interesting do you find that um [sigh] fencing is it uh what what good does it do you physically then i mean is it aerobic or does it get your muscles all in tone or 

158.53 161.12 B: well it's a little of both because 

160.28 161.11 A: uh-huh 

161.46 171.22 B: you know we work on our legs a lot the- there's a lot there's some jogging and there's a lot of the it's based on having really quick muscle movements 

165.63 166.50 A: yeah 

171.15 172.08 A: uh-huh 

171.50 180.68 B: um there's actually [mn] pardon me there's three weapons and each one requires slightly different um 

180.80 193.52 B: activity like one of them requires a lot of running up and down the strip and one of them requires you to stand kind of still and study your partner so there's not a whole lot of movement but it takes fifteen minutes 

185.53 186.41 A: uh-huh 

190.78 191.60 A: uh-huh 

192.09 192.89 A: uh-huh 

193.23 194.23 A: i see 

193.69 196.12 B: and then there's another one that's a lot of 

196.34 197.28 B: probably 

197.35 201.59 B: the most swashbuckling of the three where you just kind of run at your partner 

201.38 202.79 A: so li- 

201.83 204.64 B: and then it's over in two minutes or less 

203.69 212.14 A: s- so what are the three weapons then i i guess i'm envisioning some sort of a foil or epee type of thing and a sabre and 

211.53 223.57 B: well yeah there's a foil is the fastest one that i was describing and then there's epee which takes the longest and then there's sabre which is what i do and that's the one where you run at your partner 

214.37 215.32 A: uh-huh 

217.20 218.16 A: uh-huh 

219.91 220.83 A: i see 

220.95 221.86 A: i see 

223.06 224.84 A: a lot of running okay 

224.00 228.50 B: um if you go to fencing one o. one dot com you can learn all about it 

227.79 228.90 A: i see 

228.71 233.98 B: but um yeah and it's you have to have very strong legs 

233.60 235.02 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

234.47 236.29 B: but like quick legs 

235.69 238.17 A: yeah right 

237.53 242.89 B: and have to have a lot of stamina especially if you're doing foil because of all the running around 

239.20 240.34 A: yeah 

242.28 243.84 A: yeah sure 

243.95 245.96 B: um yeah 

245.40 249.16 A: okay well that sounds good at least you get a chance to do some of that huh 

248.67 249.77 B: mhm 

249.40 258.59 A: great great [sigh] well i should probably comment on what i do also um [lipsmack] i don't do enough of anything actually uh but um [sigh] 

253.27 254.51 B: (( mm [sigh] )) 

258.43 265.68 A: in the winter time i have a uh a rowing machine in my basement and so [sigh] you know i'm not big on [sigh] 

262.17 263.21 B: mhm 

265.58 279.89 A: going out in the dark at night or in the morning and you know walking or jogging on the street so i find that [sigh] having a rowing machine's really a pretty good thing and i try to use it about [lipsmack] three or four times a week and um 

278.67 279.29 B: (( mm )) 

279.93 285.98 A: what i i i have it in a sort of a little family room where i uh ha- also have an old t._v. 

286.03 298.33 A: so i have it set up facing the t._v. and i'll i'll row [sigh] for maybe [lipsmack] twenty or twenty five minutes i find that that's pretty good um because it uh it is 

298.27 306.58 A: it does sort of give me a little bit of muscle tone and also some aerobic exercise i can get my heart rate up a little [sigh] but i'm probably not [mn] 

306.68 309.10 A: enthusiastic about it enough 

308.95 321.77 A: [sigh] you know to really give myself a really hard strenuous work out i'm i probably take it a little a little easy in in a sense that's that's one thing i do and the other thing i've learned to do just um 

312.87 313.95 B: yeah 

321.89 326.99 A: in sort of late winter was um [lipsmack] i'm trying to learn golf and so 

327.06 338.53 A: i read in a magazine that a a way to [cough] strengthen your forearms to sort of enhance your swing [lipsmack] is to take three golf clubs in your hand you take them at the end of the shaft 

338.58 349.52 A: uh and then you just sort of hold them in a vertical position out in front of you and then you rotate your arm to the left and to the right so you move the golf clubs 

349.41 354.95 A: from the vertical to the horizontal then back to the vertical and over to the other side to the horizontal 

355.20 367.78 A: and i found that um i didn't ha- always have my golf clubs handy so i just so i started with i do have a sledge hammer so i i i couldn't hold it at the end because it's too heavy but i could hold it down a ways from the head 

361.80 363.06 B: mm [laughter] 

367.61 376.44 A: so that i could i could do that and strengthen my forearms and that was actually pretty effective i was actually [sigh] able over the course of a couple of months 

376.26 384.32 A: [sigh] to increase the number of repetitions and also to kind of move my hand further down the shaft you know to get away from the head so 

381.94 382.78 B: (( mm )) 

384.44 387.55 A: that helped but now that the weather's getting a little warmer 

385.16 385.85 B: (( [laughter] )) 

387.37 399.61 A: i'm i'm trying to get outdoors and go to a driving range and and really do the real thing and um the result of that is i don't do any rowing any more [laughter] or anything else 

393.80 394.64 B: mm 

397.89 398.98 B: [laughter] 

399.44 402.16 B: oh a- at least you're outside [laughter] 

399.68 400.50 A: uh 

401.15 403.77 A: b- yeah right right and that's 

403.79 405.72 A: (( that's nice um [mn] )) 

405.88 407.96 A: so i've i've been enjoying that i 

407.90 417.24 A: i had to curtail my activity a little bit because i had a little bit of [lipsmack] uh minor surgery i had a few moles that had to be removed and they [sigh] 

417.15 426.48 A: then when they they they kind of cut them out and then they sew you up a little bit and they don't like you to exercise and twist your body and everything like that so i've 

425.67 426.47 B: (( mm )) 

426.39 433.15 A: [lipsmack] i've been out of out of practice um [lipsmack] for the last couple of months but [lipsmack] hopefully that'll 

433.21 435.54 A: that's passed and we'll get back into it again 

435.36 439.44 B: mm [sigh] your your arm exercise sounds really hard [laughter] 

439.03 442.95 A: yeah it it uh but i guess that's the purpose isn't it i mean you 

443.06 444.77 A: you wanna do something that's 

445.21 447.29 A: gonna tax your muscles uh 

446.64 447.96 B: yeah 

447.36 449.09 A: to try to get them um 

449.10 450.56 A: get them going 

449.98 460.20 B: mm i mean i i think if there's anything that i should add it should be a little bit of weight training because it's the one thing that's [sigh] slowing me down i don't have a whole lot of stamina 

459.80 460.66 A: uh-huh 

460.29 464.94 B: and a lot of endurance and i have really like noodle skinny arms 

464.62 465.50 A: uh-huh 

465.12 472.63 B: and i think and i don't know in the past i've noticed that even just ten girly pushups a day in a week will make a big difference 

472.01 473.77 A: yeah sure 

472.84 474.86 B: so mm [lipsmack] 

474.26 476.20 A: well that sounds like a good idea 

475.59 479.61 B: yeah better than nothing [sigh] it's always better than nothing 

477.46 485.01 A: yeah i agree i agree i i think the tr- the thing the trouble i was gonna say but thing about exercise is that [sigh] 

485.02 493.88 A: you know you have to do it i mean in order to really try to stay fit it's there's there are no short cuts that i've ever learned about [sigh] 

492.03 492.92 B: (( no [lipsmack] )) 

493.89 501.80 A: um [lipsmack] the other the other thing i i will do sometimes on weekends is um [lipsmack] my wife and i will go for a walk on the beach 

501.63 502.84 B: oh really good 

502.18 506.61 A: and yeah it's nice uh not only is it nice but it's also 

506.64 516.81 A: somewhat taxing uh because of walking on the sand you know it it's uh it's harder than walking on [sigh] grass or on the pavement or or what have you so we'll 

507.72 508.84 B: mhm 

515.92 517.06 B: (( oh yeah )) 

516.88 523.67 A: we'll walk t- maybe two or three miles and um i can feel it by the end of the the walk and um 

523.77 532.66 A: i feel like that does some good and she's she's a great walker she walks almost every day of the week uh so uh 

532.75 539.35 A: so i have to make sure i can keep up with her [laughter] or else i get in trouble with myself so 

535.17 536.11 B: yeah 

539.23 549.28 B: mm most of us college students are forced to walk every day umass amherst is a huge campus and you really like yeah my first class is like half an hour away 

542.12 543.16 A: yeah 

544.41 545.86 A: yeah right 

549.30 551.50 A: oh i see yeah 

549.37 550.63 B: no joke 

550.68 553.96 B: so you get in shape at least that way 

553.67 563.70 A: well it's a nice campus i remember [sigh] going there i'm probably a lot older than you uh [sigh] i have two grown sons and um [sigh] when i was um when they were 

555.32 556.11 B: mm 

563.53 570.73 A: looking at colleges we went to umass an- amherst and looked at that and it was looked like it was very nice quite large 

570.80 574.72 A: [sigh] um and that's that's good what what year are you in 

570.96 571.74 B: mm 

574.35 582.13 B: i'm a junior but i'm decided i'm a double major in communication theory and in theater 

581.90 583.02 A: oh i see 

582.44 587.57 B: but i decided that i wanted a double degree instead so i'm gonna stay for a fifth year 

587.28 588.25 A: uh-huh 

587.89 590.41 B: which basically means i get like 

590.50 595.99 B: like you usually have a primary and a secondary major and do a little less work in the secondary major but 

590.62 591.19 A: (( [cough] )) 

595.03 597.01 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

596.27 599.20 B: i think i want more than that so 

597.84 599.37 A: uh-huh uh-huh
