3.22 4.82 B: fine how are you 

4.63 6.75 A: good [noise] where are you 

6.38 8.90 B: [noise] i'm in north carolina where are you 

8.54 10.59 A: [noise] uh i'm in new york mm 

9.97 11.04 B: oh 

11.14 12.73 B: i- in the city 

12.65 15.92 A: uh on the outside [noise] yeah 

13.88 14.93 B: oh 

15.32 19.82 B: were you involved in any way with being downtown [mn] [noise] 

19.20 24.88 A: uh not that day but i am a lot uh down that way a lot i've a 

24.90 31.86 A: uh a a delivery sort of s- job and uh go into the city a lot to make deliveries 

32.00 36.35 A: and uh my life has changed a lot based on what happened that day 

36.75 40.79 A: um uh planning wise traffic wise um 

41.16 41.72 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

41.74 48.91 A: uh they've made changes uh in new york of uh some days you're not allowed to go in with uh 

49.57 53.06 A: a uh single occupant in your car or truck 

52.79 54.11 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

53.46 58.16 A: so that means you have to not go in or find somebody to go with you [laughter] 

58.35 63.60 A: uh they do random spot checks especially on my type of a u haul truck 

63.66 64.72 A: um 

65.00 71.72 A: that they'll just pull you over and randomly search your truck and uh at checkpoints and that kind of thing 

71.93 86.14 A: and um traffic and everything else so it's really you know had a bearing on m- my life not an inconvenience because it's i think it's all worth it uh but it has changed the the way w- 

81.78 82.70 B: uh-huh 

86.49 91.44 A: [mn] everything that really works in the city now down there um 

91.45 96.51 A: it's a new wo- you know it was always crazy and wacky it's just got crazier and wackier [laughter] 

95.83 96.69 B: [laughter] 

97.38 111.35 B: well we've we don't hear about those things on the news and i have wondered myself whether any kind of changes for the normal daily routine besides just changing a traffic pattern downtown 

98.39 99.25 A: [noise] 

100.61 101.73 A: (( [noise] )) 

108.60 110.17 A: oh yeah yeah 

111.09 119.98 A: yeah well even getting into the city they they stop you on the bridges and uh there's uh a ton more police presence uh 

111.42 111.98 B: (( [noise] )) 

120.68 122.83 A: all over the place uh 

123.07 124.18 A: um 

124.24 129.10 A: you know they they've really cracked down on double parking and uh 

129.32 130.47 A: um 

129.98 131.80 B: that can't be a bad thing 

132.04 138.06 A: no no but well y- ye- yes and no for the average person driving through but for 

138.10 147.29 A: somebody that's trying to make a five minute delivery uh there's no way that there's n- you'll never get a parking spot down there and uh 

140.91 142.24 B: [noise] oh i see 

147.67 161.05 A: yeah to run into a sometimes uh to go in and to get the elevator up to the twelfth floor or wherever you're going sometimes takes you longer than the actual getting the signature and getting out of there [noise] 

159.60 161.58 B: that's probably true [noise] 

161.21 171.44 A: yeah so uh now it's uh you know the cost of it which is all part of it but now like i said though many a times they put a a uh 

171.47 185.23 A: you know in between certain hours you're not allowed to come into the city with like i said a single person in a car or a truck so now you're finding somebody to go with you and now with the the parking situations and not that they're 

185.07 188.47 A: you know [noise] picking on truck drivers but they're 

187.74 188.60 B: uh-huh 

188.91 195.70 A: they i guess that's one of their major concerns if anything's going to go on that's how it's going to be brought in next time by truck 

195.74 205.43 A: and uh this so now you have to have somebody who can drive round the block a couple of times while you're doing your thing whereas you would you know the cops were pretty good 

204.13 207.11 B: you would've left your truck and gone to 

206.00 217.59 A: yeah they you know you left your flashers on your side uh says delivery service and they sort of knew you were in and out in five ten minutes you weren't going to stay there for the day but now 

209.00 209.88 B: uh-huh 

217.56 223.46 A: you know five ten minutes you'd almost guaranteed to have a ticket on there when you come back 

223.04 225.84 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] what do they charging you for tickets [noise] 

226.15 239.85 A: uh ninety you know uh and somewhat in that vicinity and you know if you got a guy who really wants to look and you know plus not to get off the subject but they're having their own financial problems so 

240.12 242.93 A: like every other city and so they're [mn] 

241.27 255.65 B: that's that's probably about the same that they do like in a lot of other major cities where they have commuters and you have to have at least two people in the car to drive in a specific lane and if you get caught that's about what they charge you for a ticket 

255.40 256.40 A: right 

256.40 259.14 A: uh but this is uh 

259.05 274.00 A: you know i guess part of the thinking is with these random spot checks they do you could you know go into the city and then come out an hour later and go past the route you just came in and all of a sudden they unannounced set up these roadblocks 

270.68 271.86 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

273.23 275.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

274.41 282.41 A: that they uh rand- you know as i said most trucks get pulled over or waved over into a lane and you got to open up and they 

283.12 298.05 A: [noise] you know my is uh sometimes a van or whatever so i'm not carrying too much and you know it's a five minute look with a flashlight or whatever and they can tell that you know most of it's mail or boxes and uh but you know they do 

297.98 312.59 A: pull over the tractor trailers and they open them up and they look and you know that ties up that guy's schedule and throws off his delivery schedule all off and you know they're on certain date you know certain times that you know 

300.80 301.52 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

312.41 322.98 A: you got to be in and out or they'll only accept deliveries during certain hours and you know the traffic becomes a nightmare even though it was always bad now it's even worse 

323.44 325.61 B: i could see where that would be 

323.46 324.50 A: (( um )) 

327.53 328.90 A: what's that 

328.20 332.51 B: i could see where that would be were were traffic to r- really get 

332.65 334.00 B: bad if 

334.06 339.54 B: if they didn't let you do it in certain hours that was a normal delivery time [noise] 

338.97 345.33 A: yeah [noise] but i mean you know there's there's the uh you know you just gotta realise that's it all for 

345.68 349.69 A: you know it's all for good reasoning [noise] and uh 

349.58 363.35 A: you know it's inconvenient and yeah some people flip out and some people scream and yell but you're not going to do anything about it and that the the [noise] the reason why they're doing it is a good reason [noise] so um 

363.33 368.04 A: you know the the airports are tough now you know uh [noise] 

366.91 371.98 B: i have not flown myself but um several members of my family have and they 

372.05 376.75 B: said that it was much more difficult to go through airports than it was in the past 

376.12 379.48 A: yeah and uh you know again 

379.41 391.91 A: you used to be able to you know i haven't flown since myself but [lipsmack] you know they used to tell you to get there an hour before now they tell you to get there two and two and a half hours before um yeah [noise] 

391.17 394.77 B: well our daughter just flew in from florida a couple of weeks ago 

394.84 396.03 B: and 

396.25 401.09 B: the time that it took her to go from saint petersburg to the airport in tampa 

401.37 407.04 B: have to wait for the plane get on the plane fly to north carolina 

407.07 412.91 B: get picked up she could've actually been three hours longer and she could've driven 

409.61 410.51 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

413.22 416.09 A: yeah uh so you know [noise] 

416.18 419.89 A: you you know yeah there's are i think this is not only 

420.08 426.51 A: this isn't a temporary thing i think this is the way of life now based on what's happened and uh 

426.55 427.48 A: you know 

427.76 442.68 A: if knock on wood that it doesn't happen again but if it does there's going to be real changes i think [noise] and there's going to be you know life has been turned around a little bit based on it but [noise] uh it it's just [noise] 

440.94 448.14 B: see except for the airports where we are especially here in eastern north carolina i don't think there's really 

446.55 447.31 A: [noise] 

448.16 453.18 B: much of anything else different once in a while when they have the terror alerts 

450.66 452.13 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

453.32 456.16 B: because my husband is a police officer 

456.47 463.73 B: it may impact how he looks at people that he passes or someone that he might stop 

463.48 464.66 A: right 

463.86 467.11 B: differently than on a normal day 

466.64 470.04 A: someone he might not have stopped he might think of stopping 

468.96 478.69 B: ex- exactly um but for the most part very little in our daily life here has changed unless you do have to go to the airport 

470.16 471.20 A: (( right [noise] )) 

478.82 483.33 B: um for a while it was very noticeable 

481.41 482.31 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

484.24 489.20 B: as drivers were on the road that people were being more courteous 

489.56 492.38 B: and that was a really good thing 

492.19 493.04 A: (( right [noise] )) 

493.35 497.55 B: but now this much longer 

497.81 500.87 B: i think people have completely forgotten 

501.12 503.94 B: and they're worse than they were before 

503.46 505.45 A: [noise] yeah which is [noise] 

504.84 511.62 B: on a regular r- weekly basis i have to travel on a two lane road where a large part of it 

511.89 518.78 B: you can't pass which is very frustrating especially with school buses and farm equipment 

518.74 527.87 B: and people will with [laughter] no regard to curbs hills or anything else pass on double yellow lines 

527.42 528.61 A: right 

527.99 530.76 B: where i never ever saw that before so 

531.42 537.96 B: it's like people's patience levels have gone back to where they were before only they're worse than they were before 

537.75 538.78 A: right 

538.81 540.22 A: and uh 

540.07 551.52 A: you know as we all know there was the outcry in the first month or two afterwards and there was a lot of investigations and how did this happen and you know what can we do to 

551.50 558.32 A: tighten up the situation and i think you're somewhat right that we've slipped back into this comfort zone 

558.93 560.88 A: and uh [lipsmack] 

560.60 568.52 B: now from the way things were in new york before do you think there's anything they could have done that would've prevented it happening 

569.00 570.74 A: uh no 

570.92 574.22 A: i don't think you know what do i know i'm just the average joe 

574.23 576.09 A: but i think uh 

576.82 582.37 A: you just can't in this day and age you just can't cover every base and there's just 

582.41 586.54 A: so many ways you know who would've ever thought of 

586.67 591.46 A: you know of hijacking a plane and crashing it into a building i mean uh 

591.49 599.89 A: i'm sure that that the the smart people there's all kinds of ways that we don't would never even think of but i just don't think
