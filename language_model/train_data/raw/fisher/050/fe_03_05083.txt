13.99 15.88 A: i'm calling from san francisco 

15.92 18.52 B: oh i'm calling from cincinnati ohio 

18.17 19.31 A: oh okay 

19.63 21.02 B: and uh 

20.72 23.86 A: and the topic is uh airport security 

23.65 27.00 B: yes okay very important yes mhm 

26.36 34.14 A: and actually it's uh something that i have uh quite a few opinions about uh i happen to be an uh airport consultant 

33.72 35.37 B: oh okay 

35.25 36.67 A: [laughter] 

36.28 41.54 B: that's uh rather an appropriate job for the questions that you're probably gonna talk about [laughter] 

41.19 45.23 A: yeah well i i assume it was uh a random selection [laughter] 

44.96 46.24 B: oh okay 

46.78 50.97 B: and uh now how do we pro- uh proceed what's the 

51.04 52.41 B: procedure now 

52.16 59.26 A: well i think it's basically just ten minutes of conversation about the top- mm there's really no 

57.25 58.83 B: oh okay 

59.37 62.72 A: i mean essentially they just throwing in a topic just to get you to speak but there's 

59.46 60.77 B: no format 

61.82 65.88 B: th- there's no format then okay well you know um 

63.10 64.15 A: no no 

66.41 69.45 B: i've [sigh] traveled to california 

69.51 71.52 B: uh in february 

71.55 82.48 B: and i thought the security was very good um it wasn't as long a wait as it had originally been you know they want you there two hours ahead of time 

81.88 83.24 A: right 

83.06 86.52 B: but i was there [sigh] two hours ahead of time 

86.57 94.85 B: [laughter] it really wasn't necessary now it was a little longer going through security um in san diego 

94.85 103.12 B: than it was going through greater cincinnati um but it was good i mean they checked everything i wear a um 

97.39 98.53 A: mhm 

103.37 105.84 B: magnetic uh brace 

105.91 114.21 B: when i do a lotta sitting and of course being magnetic it's gonna be picked up on the uh the scanner you know 

113.98 114.95 A: mhm 

114.10 122.67 B: so it was picked up and i explained to 'em and they said well you know come aside here and we'll check you a little more thoroughly which they did 

122.72 129.18 B: uh [sigh] we did have to take off our belts when we were in um san diego 

129.44 135.84 B: uh because of the buckle thing and of course emptying out your pockets which is pretty usual you know 

131.25 132.52 A: mhm 

135.99 143.55 B: and uh [sigh] but it went along smooth the people were very very polite um very thorough i thought and um 

143.59 151.22 B: i feel good about the whole thing it doesn't make any difference to me whether you have to wait or not because i'd rather wait on the 

151.24 158.21 B: ground than have a disaster up in the sky you know so uh it worked very well do you find it that way 

154.59 155.62 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

158.77 159.88 A: well 

160.00 164.68 A: i would i would say in in in the big picture in the scheme of things 

164.17 165.05 B: uh-huh 

165.68 180.42 A: checkpoint security which has been really the focus of people's attention and the media understandably because as a consumer of air travel that's really the uh the interface that you have with the security that's in place 

170.71 171.64 B: uh-huh 

180.22 181.58 B: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

181.57 189.73 A: but i would i would argue that it is only a small part of what is really needed to ensure the safety of the system 

190.00 200.58 A: and in many ways uh could even be you know in excess of what is needed [lipsmack] 'cause when you think about it the the type of 

200.76 207.25 A: or the type of risks that you're facing and uh you know the the type of event like a nine eleven event 

202.60 203.50 B: (( yes )) 

206.46 207.63 B: mhm 

207.13 220.97 A: um you know i- in many ways it was a one time kind of freakish thing you know 'cause clearly if someone shows up on a plane and they're intending to do harm to people and they're armed with a you know a butter knife or something like that or 

216.59 217.50 B: mhm 

219.76 220.63 B: sure 

220.78 230.85 A: even a box cutter um they're not gonna get too far in that process because simply the staff has been trained the the passengers are dialed in 

225.60 227.32 B: not any more [laughter] 

230.44 231.45 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

230.83 237.31 A: and then of course there's also uh you know kind of randomly placed armed guards on the on the plane as well [lipsmack] so 

234.84 235.69 B: yeah 

237.55 244.15 A: when you think about the the level to which they're confiscating nail clippers and and [mn] 

243.15 244.78 B: yeah that's true 

244.47 249.64 A: beauty scissors and you know just really kind of inconsequential little items um [lipsmack] 

245.69 246.76 B: (( mhm )) 

249.70 257.60 A: you know you might say it's really gone overboard a bit as well as you know the amount of uh [mn] i don't know i was just i travel quite a bit 

257.07 257.90 B: (( do ya )) 

257.40 266.76 A: and going through airports you know you just look around and you see how many people are sitting around and you feel like we're recreating the soviet union i mean there are so many make work jobs 

266.78 269.39 A: uh these folks just sitting around with nothing to do 

268.94 269.84 B: (( uh-huh )) 

269.57 278.76 A: and uh you know no doubt that uh you know there are there are good intentions but when you look at the overall kind of risk matrix in life 

278.66 289.03 A: you know your chances of dying of uh of uh infection from botulism or from e. coli poisoning from eating uh undercooked beef at a mcdonald's 

284.45 285.50 B: yeah 

286.01 286.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

288.48 289.80 B: mhm yeah 

289.08 295.94 A: you know is so much higher than uh ever being uh harmed in a in a in a air piracy 

294.19 297.14 B: in an airplane yeah well i can under- 

296.05 302.63 A: situation yet we don't have armed guards at every fry cook to make sure that they properly cook a hamburger you know so 

299.65 300.43 B: right 

302.84 313.69 A: i- it's [mn] i just think airport security has has become such a a symbol of what this country is doing to you know in a sense crack down post nine eleven 

313.25 314.68 B: mhm 

313.92 321.92 A: but y- y- you really have to take it all with a grain of salt because there are many other vulnerabilities that we have and many 

321.19 321.94 B: sure 

321.89 333.69 A: easier targets where you could t- you know inflict all kinds of of you know bodily harm on people and not go to the trouble of you know [mn] circumventing the the airport security system so 

330.69 331.58 B: (( of hi- )) 

331.77 333.60 B: hi- hijacking a plane 

334.28 336.52 A: i guess maybe i sound a little 

336.57 338.97 A: jaundiced on this whole [laughter] thing but uh 

337.86 346.61 B: well well you're a seasoned traveler you know like you you say you travel a lot that's fine i might travel three or four times a year on a plane 

346.22 347.30 A: mhm 

346.49 359.16 B: um to me it didn't bother me i was happy that it happened but if you're gonna be traveling every week or a couple of times a month or something like that then of course you know i can understand what you're telling me 

349.50 350.28 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

359.39 360.56 B: but i thought 

360.70 363.05 B: they handled themselves quite well 

363.02 377.39 B: um you know it was o- it was very unbelievable that four airplanes could be hijacked you know in a very short period of time from different places now that'll never happen again well look there was just a deal 

371.77 372.86 A: mhm 

377.70 384.68 B: that was foiled i think it was in australia in the last couple of days a guy had wooden spoons 

384.95 397.44 B: that were very very pointed on the one end and he was using those as a weapon he was trying to get into the cockpit and he was overtaken by the security guards that you mentioned plus the passengers 

387.32 388.22 A: mhm 

397.12 398.09 A: sure 

397.82 405.51 B: and he was arrested when they when they landed but i mean you know you can have weapons made out of anything not just metal you know 

400.22 401.20 A: mhm 

403.54 404.45 A: sure 

405.42 417.77 B: and that proved the point right there um when i was um leaving cincinnati um back in february there was a lady that was i guess spanish or some foreign 

417.69 422.58 B: and um she had some kind of wild kind of shoes on 

422.72 425.20 B: and uh they took her shoes away 

425.50 431.74 B: took 'em to wherever they took 'em and um tested 'em i guess and brought 'em back put 'em back on her and that was it 

431.63 438.18 B: but you know you have there's so many wackos around and [laughter] you've gotta really be careful 

437.97 451.60 B: now i don't think we'll ever be you had mentioned something about soviet state i don't think we'll ever be that but you know it'll never be life as usual as we americans have had all the freedom for all the years you know 

447.28 448.23 A: (( mhm )) 

451.68 461.31 B: um it's just these bad people in the world [sigh] that don't like americans and they're gonna do anything to destroy us or try to destroy us 

461.35 468.08 B: and i felt that the way president bush handled himself uh with the crisis 

468.15 478.00 B: i thought it was you know commendable very commendable i thought he did a fine job i didn't vote for the man [laughter] but i thought he's doing a decent job he's trying to 

477.86 486.29 B: you know get rid of the bad guys or at least control them he'll never get rid of them but he'll control them hopefully and uh you know things will 

486.31 493.21 B: maybe be back to something similar as they were you know a few years ago 

493.18 507.69 B: um never be the same it's just the people that are [laughter] out in this world that are that hate americans when you used to travel abroad years ago americans were kinda held up on a pedestal 

507.39 508.67 A: mhm 

507.96 513.43 B: now huh they'll throw eggs at us you know i mean they don't think anything of americans anymore 

513.37 523.42 B: we're the almost the enemy you know we're basically the good guys uh after the fall of the the communist empire um and i just feel that 

523.56 531.85 B: hey we're gonna have to accept this it's not gonna get any better it might get a little more lenient but if you travel i a lot like you say you do 

531.55 532.59 A: mhm 

531.89 536.83 B: i can imagine that's a problem you know that would uh irritate you because you're used to the old days 

536.98 548.12 A: oh really actually it doesn't it doesn't bother me from a user's perspective because i know how the system works and i know what to do is not to trigger any alarms and so forth 

540.69 542.41 B: doesn't it really mhm 

547.49 548.39 B: uh-huh 

548.02 554.58 A: for example i usually go right through and i haven't in in the early days after nine eleven 

554.09 555.22 B: mhm 

554.59 568.41 A: i was routinely pulled aside and secondary inspection and all this kinda stuff and now when i travel i just make sure i wear shoes with no metal on them and i make sure to empty out all my pockets and in fact 

558.39 559.41 B: yeah 

563.43 565.39 B: right mhm 

566.76 567.87 B: (( mhm right )) 

568.39 583.35 A: um probably after traveling i'd say over twenty times i was just pulled aside um this last time for the first time in about twenty uh traveling episodes because i forgot that i had left a cellphone in my pocket 

582.72 584.43 B: oh yeah okay 

583.57 588.20 A: and so then i had to go through the whole thing and take my shoes off etc but 

584.52 585.43 B: mhm 

585.94 587.02 B: mhm 

587.53 588.25 B: sure 

588.54 599.89 A: i guess i don't know i my my perspective though is that you sh- all this focus on passenger checkpoint security is really a very it's kinda small part of our overall um security 

599.04 599.95 B: yeah
