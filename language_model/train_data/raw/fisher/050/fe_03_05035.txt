111.03 114.69 A: like ever since then i've i've been more [mn] i watch more news on t._v. 

114.78 127.30 A: and i tried to understand like things you know reasons behind what's going on like in the middle east and you know with the war in iraq that we just had stuff like that i'm trying to 

126.40 127.24 B: mm 

127.37 134.79 A: you know i want to be aware of what's going on in the world and not just what's you know in my little neighbourhood basically 

134.05 135.97 B: yeah it's good you have to [cough] 

137.16 148.50 B: y- yeah it makes you more knowledgeable i think because you wanna be more in tune with what's happening except the middle east y- now you know 'cause of what happened you know it's more up front now 

142.12 143.76 A: mhm 

148.23 149.12 A: right 

153.03 159.40 B: but that is the politics but to me y- you know i don't know if you're uh if you're on the right or the left i don't know [mn] 

159.30 161.49 A: [sigh] i'm still trying to figure that one out 

160.83 163.29 B: oh are you okay n- yeah 

161.51 164.46 A: yeah yeah i'm somewhere in the middle but yeah 

163.80 167.74 B: i i i'm more uh no i'm more conservative 

167.14 168.21 A: (( yeah [sigh] [noise] )) 

167.96 168.76 B: (( [mn] )) 

169.92 173.07 B: but uh uh i don't know [cough]

183.32 193.81 B: what else you know all these you know all these liberals like uh god almighty i i can't stand hilary clinton i never voted for her i i i i don't know how anybody could vote for her [laughter] i mean it just pisses me off 

192.05 194.48 A: [laughter] mhm uh-huh 

194.95 197.40 B: she's a senator yeah 

199.29 202.89 B: but it just seems that they're taking advantage of the situation and you know 

203.43 209.27 B: you know putting uh the general opinion about right and uh i just think it's totally wrong 

208.88 210.94 A: (( [noise] yeah um )) 

213.92 214.83 A: [sigh] 

214.86 220.27 B: i mean do you feel like y- you know you look at the people who're from the middle east a little differently now 

221.36 226.20 A: um that's tough like you know being at penn state there's 

226.23 230.89 A: s- some limited diversity and you know so 

228.38 229.39 B: okay 

232.13 234.01 A: [mn] um [sigh] 

236.34 240.20 A: yes and no like i i i try 

241.02 243.69 A: i try very hard not to automatically 

243.91 250.59 A: you know put prejudiced or you know any prior mind set towards 

251.35 259.10 A: any person based on where they're from or what they look like or anything like that [sigh] but now like i do [sigh] 

255.30 256.61 B: right 

259.88 266.58 A: i'm more aware that a lot of people come from different backgrounds and cultures and you know 

267.00 272.33 A: [sigh] that they grew up thinking a whole different way than people around here do 

272.18 273.31 B: yes 

273.52 276.16 A: and so i'm trying to be more aware and [sigh] 

277.28 281.23 A: uh realizing that uh if i deal with them [mn] 

285.73 287.54 B: [noise] yeah well um 

288.27 299.03 B: yeah it's difficult not to look at you know people uh at the middle east in a different way i one of my uh college places i went to um [cough] i went polytech in brooklyn 

299.33 313.47 B: and you know he's moslem and he's one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet i mean he's a really nice guy and you know he he knows what happened was wrong you know and i always think well you know gee i mean i know my friend and he you know i mean he wouldn't hurt a fly 

313.48 318.52 B: but i think somebody else who doesn't know him would probably think oh gee you know you s- you know 

318.59 330.01 B: he's going to be thought of as you know possibly a terrorist or he's up to no good just because of the fact that he's middle eastern and he's moslem you know they'll get that he's moslem that uh you know he's 

322.17 323.51 A: (( [sigh] mhm mhm )) 

326.31 329.16 A: (( mhm definitely yeah mhm )) 

330.62 334.13 B: some shit now and that you know he's a good person 

338.39 339.93 A: yeah um 

339.84 351.58 B: i think it makes you a little more appreciative uh of what you have i mean 'cause uh you know if you have friends like i i went to high school with one guy who was a fireman and you know he he was among the uh people there 

351.69 353.32 A: yeah 

353.83 356.71 B: (( it was like i remember him he was he was a he was a nice guy i mean )) 

356.89 371.87 B: you know i remember t- i used to talk to him a lot in uh high school and then i lost touch with him but you know you s- happens he's one of the victims i know he had um you know a wife and a young uh kid you know and it's like y- you think gee 

373.14 378.81 B: you know here y- y- you're here today and then you know something happen- something tragic happens and you know 

378.95 381.25 B: you leave a wife and kid behind 

380.63 383.21 A: [mn] mhm yeah definitely 

381.40 383.65 B: i think it's wow you know it's [sigh] 

385.23 386.85 B: they should be thankful 

385.34 398.29 A: yeah a lot of different things were eye opening in regard to that yeah makes you like a lot of questions in the back like that you've kind of pushed to the back not to answer the kind of major answer 

388.27 389.18 B: yes 

389.71 391.08 B: oh yeah 

398.12 399.38 B: yes 

398.90 400.21 A: i think 

401.30 402.60 A: [sigh] 'cause you know 

403.02 405.58 A: like [mn] i'm in the middle of nowhere 

405.75 410.24 A: you know and i feel pretty safe you know i'm not worried about 

410.29 413.90 A: you know but now not that i'm really worried but [sigh] 

415.09 424.44 A: anything's really possible but you can't really live in fear all the time but you definitely just have to be a little aware and [sigh] a 

421.09 422.09 B: [noise] no 

424.65 426.48 A: little smart i guess 

425.58 429.28 B: yeah how was it on campus like uh i mean

432.88 436.92 B: [mn] you know they sympathetic or they you know say it's america's fault 

437.45 443.32 B: because i've heard that from college students like er reading on the internet and if i watched the news 

439.68 440.94 A: (( hm um )) 

443.40 447.57 B: (( you know you know i i see college students say 'oh well it's america's fault' )) 

447.18 448.70 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] um )) 

449.25 454.16 A: yeah there there is definitely uh a diversity in opinion on that 

453.72 454.76 B: okay 

454.30 456.68 A: um it seems like sometimes the 

457.64 462.11 A: you know the loudest groups though are the [laughter] smallest especially some of the liberal
