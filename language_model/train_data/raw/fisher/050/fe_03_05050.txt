34.57 37.09 B: could be benefits you know uh don't they 

37.30 38.99 B: (( i think they have plenty of money )) 

39.84 41.70 A: you think they have the right 

40.99 44.84 B: (( and that i don't really think they have the right to strike i guess but it's uh )) 

45.85 49.03 B: it's a different they're getting paid millions to do that you know [mn] 

48.79 50.90 A: uh they're getting paid big bucks 

50.30 52.05 B: (( i reckon they are [mn] )) 

52.88 57.61 A: for you know and th- the few things [noise] i know of and i'm not that [sigh] 

57.64 62.12 A: up to it but the few things i know of that they strike about i think they're nuts 

62.05 63.35 B: (( right [noise] )) 

62.55 73.53 A: you know they're worried about you know the contribution to their pensions and [sigh] and uh you know the minimum salary for the new ballplayers coming in that you know 

73.55 88.21 A: they want uh i guess uh something to the effect that the you know always like in baseball the minimum salary right now is fifty or sixty thousand [sigh] and they want to raise it up to a hundred thousand [mn] well you know 

88.79 96.22 A: fifty sixty thousand you know there- there's people would give uh a limb to be able to play pro ball for that kind of money 

95.65 97.36 B: (( [noise] oh yeah mhm yes absolutely [noise] )) 

97.19 111.74 A: and uh you know and [sigh] i guess you know when you think about it all these millionaire athletes well there's something like uh you you know only ten percent of them make the real big bucks everybody still makes you know 

111.78 121.92 A: eight hundred thousand or something but there's only a couple of guys there you know not that many or two on every team or something that's making over two million a year or something [sigh] 

121.99 122.97 A: (( uh )) 

123.44 136.88 A: [lipsmack] but i don't know i i just think you know yes everybody has a right to strike if you know working conditions or if you're underpaid but i don't think these guys can cry that they're underpaid 

136.97 141.11 A: and i don't think the working conditions are that bad 

141.25 143.92 A: so i sort of get you know 

144.46 149.58 A: a li- a little annoyed when they gotta cancel a season or uh 

149.11 150.37 B: (( right )) 

149.81 150.96 A: (( um )) 

151.07 151.94 A: you know 

151.98 154.60 A: they start crying the blues and everything 

154.23 160.71 B: [noise] [mn] uh uh that's totally where they can really get what they want though i can see what you're saying too uh i guess they would 

161.86 162.87 A: yeah 

162.04 167.69 B: (( [sigh] uh that is uh the only way they can actually say something too you know what i'm saying i guess they would just you know )) 

169.26 171.16 B: (( that is their power you know )) 

171.25 180.92 A: yeah they they're entitled to it or whatever but i think they're going to d- you know they're going to drive uh the people are just going to get fed up and [mn] and you know 

172.45 175.27 B: (( with the entrepreneur mhm [noise] yeah yeah )) 

180.76 188.73 A: i guess last time they struck it you know y- it took a year or two for the attendance to come back [sigh] 'cause people just uh 

189.22 198.54 A: you know said i'm not going to put up with this and these guys are crazy and you know i think the majority of the people take the owners' side 

199.23 199.92 A: (( [mn] you )) 

200.45 201.27 A: (( know )) 

200.72 202.78 B: i do usually in 'em too [mn] 

202.63 203.84 A: what's that 

203.22 205.73 B: i do usually in the strikes 

206.52 207.58 A: what do you mean 

207.25 209.03 B: i take the owners' side 

208.47 209.43 A: you do 

209.07 210.27 B: yeah 

209.66 214.72 A: yeah well these g- you know the owner lays out some serious money to you know 

211.44 212.26 B: (( rights )) 

215.39 219.32 A: to buy a team or whatever and it's a business and you know [mn] 

219.38 229.20 A: you know he's the one who had to lay out a hundred million or two hundred million to buy the franchise or whatever it is you know and then these players they want to be partners 

229.71 230.81 A: (( uh )) 

230.63 245.48 A: you know [mn] you know th- th- and you gotta i relate it to the average guy working you know the average guy doesn't get to be a partner and can you know even if you're the top salesman you can't walk in and say i want to be yeah you can walk in and say 

245.97 251.93 A: you know i want a piece of the company but you know the g- or i'm quitting well the guy's going to say goodbye 

253.42 255.95 A: you know unfortunately in the sports 

256.26 259.66 A: you know the super stars they sort of got 'em where you know 

260.10 264.08 A: [mn] the owner almost needs them as much as uh 

264.17 267.73 A: you know 'cause the player knows he uh can end up going somewheres else 

270.50 271.31 A: so 

272.00 274.91 B: (( [noise] mm yeah i i think they're just a bunch of big babies [mn] )) 

272.29 285.06 A: i i like you say i'm on the whatever it is subject comes up i sort of listen to what the gripes are but [sigh] generally over the last couple of strikes that i've lived through or whatever i was always on the owners' side 

285.31 295.34 A: because i just think they got a little too greedy and you know now you know one of the things in basketball is that you know the owners want to drug test and the players say no 

295.91 298.83 A: but why shouldn't there be a drug test you know 

299.24 308.86 A: you know it's a personal belief or this or that and [sigh] uh you know the the way the country's going near nobody gets a job anymore without a drug test 

299.29 300.79 B: (( mhm right it- it's )) 

308.33 311.93 B: (( um yeah that's kind of rare you know most of the jobs i've had have [mn] mm [laughter] yeah )) 

311.33 322.29 A: yeah you know and they and they don't want you know they want a uh a a a three day notice or uh wh- what do you need a notice for if you've got nothing to hide 

322.27 335.18 A: you know and they they claim that they're just looking out for the other guy the little guys and this and that but you know [mn] well if you're going to strike because of a drug test i think you're uh you're nuts and uh 

335.20 337.83 A: you know i think you're just gonna turn people off 

338.96 353.30 A: you know and and they're already you know you get the cry babies and the [sigh] the ones who are always whining that uh they're not appreciated or you know y- you're making five million dollars a year [laughter] 

353.37 355.68 A: wh- what have we gotta do to appreciate you 

356.42 357.16 A: (( you know )) 

357.90 362.22 A: so uh most of the time like i said i'm on the owners' side 

362.07 364.57 B: and most of the time too i haven't really seen anything 

365.05 368.95 B: that would really turn me towards the players' side now it- it's usually money 

368.53 369.61 A: yeah 

369.01 372.12 B: and it's not usually conditions or 

372.18 383.83 A: yeah or they you know they want more a piece when the television contracts come out they want mo- you know and they sign the deal that the players' association gets [sigh] more and uh 

373.53 374.44 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

383.85 388.72 A: you know uh if you guys want more then you go buy at team and start your own team and uh 

389.17 393.19 A: you know see if you can do it and then you'll get a piece of the action or whatever 

393.92 397.77 A: you know [mn] i don't understand this piece of the action stuff 

398.30 406.05 A: you know no one else in the real world can't go in and get a piece of the action all of a sudden because you're a star arth- athlete you deserve a piece 

407.12 410.20 A: you know they they get that attitude that uh 

410.60 417.13 A: you know the game can't go on without them or or the game will suffer without them 

417.42 421.05 B: [mn] see i think y- it could be replaced too 'cause there's always somebody show no one's 

422.71 424.97 A: [sigh] yeah 

423.51 429.02 B: coming up too you get to a certain point they just lose the money and [mn] replace some of them you know [mn] yeah 

429.32 436.13 A: well that's you know like they do with football they brought in those replacement players and that never worked out you know 

437.10 446.86 A: then you find out how bad a product they had and they scramble and then they you know the players knew they could hold out and the owners gave in and 

446.63 453.20 A: [sigh] you know they you know i don't know there just seems half the time it seems like all strikes with uh 

453.06 467.99 A: just your regular world that people go on strike [sigh] you know they just you know they settle in ten days and when you find out what they actually finally settled for you wonder why that couldn't have been why do you have to strike you couldn't come to that agreement before 

469.17 470.88 A: but 

471.22 473.87 A: yeah yeah and people are never happy 

473.32 475.79 B: mhm uh uh uh just a way of getting 

475.58 476.67 A: yeah 

476.06 477.55 B: forced order to pay you 

478.66 486.32 A: yeah and then this you know this this kid this basketball player getting ninety million before he even plays a game an eighteen year old kid 

486.64 487.45 A: (( you know )) 

487.62 489.33 B: ((  )) 

489.23 490.29 A: (( huh )) 

489.73 490.94 B: who's that 

490.37 492.25 A: this lebron james 

493.91 499.91 A: he's a high school kid he's jumping right to the pros and nike gave him a ninety million dollar sneaker contract 

500.21 512.92 A: well what incentive does this kid have before he he hasn't even played a game yet in the pros and he's getting ninety million t- contract for the sneakers and that's before he even gets his contract to play for a team [sigh] 

513.07 521.93 A: so you know uh it's this what's that one what incentive has this guy gotta go out and prove himself and earn his spot and uh you know i i thought 

521.76 534.17 A: [mn] you know in this day and age you had to earn you know those kind of money and that was what your reward you got for after loyalty and being straight and narrow and these people are getting that kind of money before they even play a game 

533.89 535.10 B: (( who is that mhm [mn] mhm )) 

535.20 545.18 A: you know that's why i i think the the average person has no uh consideration for the players any more because it's just gotten out of control the salaries and everything 

545.21 552.34 A: [sigh] and what these guys are making you know we the i i think they got nothing to complain about 

553.22 558.27 A: [sigh] you know i i would like i said i'd give a limb to uh be in their position 

558.58 563.51 A: and they you know they seem to cry about the stupidest things 

563.57 565.30 A: but 

566.15 568.44 A: that's the way of the world i guess 

569.03 570.72 B: (( [mn] [noise] well mm [sigh] looks like it looks )) 

571.40 573.20 A: what's that 

572.04 574.74 B: like it [sigh] it sounds like it looks like it too 

576.23 577.59 A: yeah 

577.88 584.36 A: [mn] [sigh] i don't know which way it's going to turn but i don't think there's another strike on the horizon is there 

583.62 585.43 B: [noise] [mn] [sigh] i haven't heard of one 

585.33 587.66 A: (( no i don't i don't think uh )) 

588.22 599.95 A: of baseball i think's got another two years and basketball just signed theirs and [noise] i don't know where football stands and hockey i don't even follow
