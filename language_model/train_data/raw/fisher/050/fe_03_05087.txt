25.55 27.97 A: you know but they do what they gotta do [noise] 

28.91 33.04 B: yeah 'cause these uh there's terrorists are um so unpredictable 

32.91 45.06 A: yeah i i think there's so many other ways that you know that they can terrorize you i mean i guess it's good to el- eliminate something uh where so many people can be affected in one shot you know what i mean 

43.90 50.42 B: yeah right they might think that they're getting the jackpot if they you know blow up a plane or something like that 

45.46 46.67 A: well it's uh 

49.75 54.55 A: yeah it really something kinda you know symbolic knocking out the world trade center too a

118.17 119.30 B: oh 

119.45 120.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

120.80 122.00 A: but uh 

123.15 128.44 A: yeah you know i'm i'm in the security end of things with the federal government so 

128.59 135.29 A: i'm used to you know running people through the metal detectors and the x rays machines every day coming to work and stuff so 

132.81 133.73 B: yeah 

135.72 136.71 A: uh 

136.30 141.27 B: what kind of offends me is the i don't like being thought that i could be like a terrorist 

140.92 143.08 A: yeah you don't wanna get profiled huh 

142.62 143.80 B: [laughter] 

143.94 146.34 A: yeah they have weird methods of 

146.68 151.02 A: [noise] you know who's going to get checked you know the extra check so to speak you what i mean 

148.37 149.44 B: yeah 

151.24 154.77 A: who's gonna get taken to the side for whatever reason 

154.97 156.37 A: and uh 

156.96 160.40 A: you know get a more thorough search and stuff 

160.56 161.44 A: (( um )) 

160.58 170.06 B: actually i have been taken to the side uh before i can't believe they thought i was a terrorist so yeah they said listen uh sir why don't you just step over here and uh 

171.25 175.54 B: like they treated me like a v._i._p. or something so i didn't know i don't know what's going on with that 

174.95 176.67 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

177.06 180.84 A: yeah the other thing that bothers me yeah 

177.83 179.60 B: maybe i've got that kind of face 

181.94 188.16 A: the other thing that bothers me is that i work uh you know not far from sears tower so that could be a a hard target 

187.62 188.64 B: mhm 

188.20 189.53 A: and uh 

189.58 203.11 A: well i guess i'm straying away from the airport thing but uh we do a lot of visiting dignitaries and politicians and stuff and actually you know we can arrange for them to bypass the security when we have to 

203.78 208.87 A: so not everybody has to go through it it's all who you are and you know who you know and stuff 

203.88 204.73 B: yeah 

211.23 213.69 B: yeah they pick on the little people 

213.31 214.72 A: of course [sigh] 

215.56 217.97 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] but uh )) 

218.27 224.93 A: you know we go to o'hare airport frequently and i think the quality of the screeners uh is a lot better 

225.11 230.51 A: than uh you know these private security rinky dinky security firms that they had 

229.92 232.55 B: so it is different it's different from o'hare and midway 

232.63 236.89 A: yeah um just crowd wise you know midway's 

236.92 242.62 A: uh you know maybe a quarter of the size of that of o'hare o'hare is just huge you know 

240.74 241.60 B: yeah 

242.10 243.33 B: yeah 

243.24 254.97 A: um but midway's getting getting busier and busier and expanding and stuff but security's pretty much the same it's you know the transportation safety administration the t._s._a. guys 

255.55 256.81 A: and uh 

257.58 267.66 A: they go through some pretty tense training it's it's hard uh looking at x ray machines and stuff for uh hours on end and and i think they switch these guys off so 

264.07 265.07 B: mhm 

267.49 274.42 A: they don't get totally bored just staring you know and get kind of uh lackadaisical or careless you know what i mean 

269.68 270.50 B: yeah 

274.14 278.79 B: (( yeah well they should have uh shift so uh people uh people don't do the same thing )) 

277.35 290.38 A: well there's a few i tell you you know i do the training on the x rays machines and you know after forty five minutes or an hour you know that's enough where we rotate the guys and and get somebody else in there you know keep 'em fresh 

291.15 294.81 A: so otherwise they're gonna get lazy and they're gonna miss something 

294.21 302.55 B: yeah is tha- is that usually um before this uh before these uh plane scares you also had to shift them change them every forty five minutes or so 

303.49 305.16 A: w- what was that i'm sorry 

304.70 307.77 B: did you guys usually uh before the uh 

308.03 312.89 B: (( the terrorist attacks and all that did you still switch people off uh that frequently or )) 

312.67 319.97 A: yeah yeah yeah it's a a federal reserve system so there's you know billions of dollars in the building [laughter] 

319.62 320.87 B: (( mm yeah )) 

319.99 322.49 A: and we've always had real tight security 

323.84 324.78 A: so 

325.64 340.46 A: [noise] you know some people uh they get used to it but we the people that work there you know it's kind of imagine if i don't know whatever kind of work you're doing imagine if you came to work everyday and you had to go through the screening you know what i mea [laughter] people are in a hurry to get to work they're running late 

336.66 338.21 B: mhm yeah 

340.30 344.62 A: they don't have a lot of patience for standing in line even if it's for just a few minutes you know 

344.23 346.11 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

345.44 348.20 A: but it's just uh a fact of life 

349.18 350.06 A: so 

350.77 351.74 A: uh 

352.59 362.13 A: yeah i haven't my wife's flown quite a few times since nine eleven and [cough] i don't think she looks like a terrorist either but they got her taking off her shoes you know [laughter] and all these stuff you know 

360.65 361.55 B: [laughter] 

362.42 365.77 A: and uh her eighty year old mother the same deal you know what i mean 

365.35 366.70 B: (( yeah so )) 

366.06 368.98 A: they're searching the eighty year old woman you know 

368.01 369.69 B: they're worried about everybody 

369.32 373.04 A: yeah so you just don't know uh what exactly their 

373.83 375.83 A: uh reasoning is but 

374.11 380.38 B: has there been any have there been any bad things in with the company before so they're really worried about it or what 

380.09 381.28 A: where i work 

381.18 383.01 B: (( no where your wife work there )) 

382.11 383.00 A: oh 

383.22 387.22 A: no no i mean i'm just talking about going through the the airport and stuff for her 

386.49 387.42 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

387.40 393.06 A: uh she doesn't have to go through metal detectors and stuff when she goes to work but just when she's flying of course 

393.77 396.70 A: (( uh but )) 

396.94 398.00 A: uh 

398.81 403.60 A: i imagine uh that they're checking international flights pretty closely too you know what i mean 

403.27 405.07 B: yeah 

404.59 405.50 A: uh 

405.85 407.89 B: the international flight should be worse 

407.67 410.92 A: yeah there's a big international terminal at o'hare and 

410.32 411.48 B: yeah 

411.18 413.66 A: i mean it's real wild in there 

413.71 419.32 A: you know everybody's talking a different language and it's just wild over there 

419.86 421.03 A: but 

421.84 425.13 A: like i said i think it's worth it and uh 

425.14 431.95 A: you know a minor inconvenience that you can't go meet your party like at the gate you know your wife is getting off the plane or something 

429.80 430.74 B: right 

431.02 437.28 B: well you're going to see 'em anyway so not a big pick pick one of the meet in the parking lot or something like that yeah 

432.06 433.45 A: (( yeah )) 

436.05 448.74 A: it's what you have to do and then you can't even sit out there you know when you're driving around or you pull over there's coppers or traffic aides or whatever you call 'em writing tickets if you're not you know if you're not moving uh fast enough and stuff it's 

440.57 441.43 B: yeah 

447.61 449.43 B: yeah 

448.79 451.14 A: kinda hassle out there you know 

451.91 455.12 A: they're towing cars people are getting pissed [laughter] 

455.54 460.43 B: that's kind of stupid 'cause you know you tr- everybody's trying to get out of the airport no one wants to stay at the airport 

459.80 462.84 A: (( yeah but )) 

464.19 467.02 A: i don't know what else they can do you know 

467.28 468.40 B: yeah 

467.76 470.22 A: it you know i'm i'm sure that had to 

470.69 475.07 A: the system can be you know 'cause there can be a breakdown in the system 

475.14 480.13 A: uh there's all kinds of plastic explosives things that metal detectors don't find you know 

480.73 489.05 A: the plane itself has got uh you know thousands of gallons of gasoline in it you know what i mean that's a bomb waiting to happen right there 

488.57 490.31 B: yeah 

489.82 497.72 A: [laughter] so so many people have access to the planes the people that fix them the people that bring the food the people that do the baggage 

497.84 503.54 A: you know i don't see how they can you know keep a tight lid on it for a determined terrorist you know 

505.35 506.25 A: mm 

507.45 509.53 B: no it's a pretty scary situation 

510.30 512.19 B: 'cause anything could happen 

511.63 514.24 A: yeah how many of these calls have you done so far 

514.94 516.94 B: um this is my second

528.86 530.44 A: i i heard that they haven't

534.04 539.50 A: yeah if it works out good i'll recommend it to all my friends you know [laughter] 

539.87 543.31 A: but i heard they were having a hard time getting men too for some reason
