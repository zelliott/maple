425.47 430.98 B: [noise] there's too much activity still going on around them as you drive by makes me wonder 

430.97 434.51 A: [noise] yeah there's too much stuff going on that that we don't know about 

434.17 439.13 B: yeah and we only we only know what they want us to hear 

435.61 436.71 A: they try to keep 

438.79 442.34 A: yeah it's it's a lot i think it's a lot more to it than that 

442.35 443.86 B: i do too 

445.48 452.55 B: um the older i get the more skeptical i get on what what i hear on the news it's like [noise] 

452.63 457.00 B: is that really the news or is that what i'm supposed to hear 

457.05 457.98 B: [laughter]

458.52 459.63 B: [laughter] 

461.61 464.97 B: [laughter] and it's kind of wild [noise] 

468.47 469.04 B: [noise] 

468.51 471.86 A: (( but yeah that's yeah that's that's crazy though )) 

475.21 478.59 A: so what's like how are they dealing with it in missouri 

478.97 481.62 A: like what's the talk up there about september eleven 

482.21 488.02 B: oh just about how awful it is and stuff you know we're so far away 

488.35 501.62 B: um it has affected our economy quite a bit don't anybody seem to have as much or have as much good a like lots of people i know are not working now at all 

492.94 493.67 A: (( mhm )) 

501.89 504.36 A: see it it's not like that here you know every 

503.33 505.27 B: oh really 

504.53 506.53 A: yeah everything's pretty much the same 

506.36 508.01 B: wow 

508.13 509.45 A: (( yeah our gas )) 

508.17 508.98 B: (( are you )) 

509.83 516.60 A: our gas prices went up a little bit but they dropped back down to a regular price so e- everything's pretty much the same 

514.63 515.82 B: our 

517.17 524.09 B: it's it's affected it here quite a bit it takes a while longer it seems like 

524.63 533.98 B: out here in the middle of nowhere when something happens on either coast or anywhere else in the world that it takes longer to affect us 

534.01 534.86 A: mhm 

535.32 537.12 B: it's kinda weird 

538.69 549.22 B: so we have we have like quite a bit of months to for things to soak in before it hits us and then when it hits us it don't seem like it goes away near as quick either 

551.05 551.85 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

551.69 553.06 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

555.43 559.59 B: it certainly certainly made a difference in the way you think

562.81 563.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

565.11 566.99 A: (( you know i took um a ))

580.46 581.82 A: (( yes at first i w- )) 

583.02 586.64 A: at first i didn't believe we was going but like as time went 

586.69 591.07 A: (( as like the years passed like things kept getting worse and worse )) 

591.83 592.65 A: so 

593.71 595.84 A: i figured it'll happen sooner or later 

596.00 597.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] that's )) 

596.36 598.75 A: (( the sooner it happens the sooner it's over with ))
