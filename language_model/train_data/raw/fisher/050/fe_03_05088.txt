41.77 43.02 A: (( it's hot down there )) 

42.92 52.17 B: it's a neat state it's just if we have we have an incredibly incredibly high humidity count and so i mean naturally being the water that happens a lot but um 

51.85 52.53 A: uh-huh 

52.55 54.11 B: it's just it 

54.28 61.15 B: you know and this isn't even our worst month our worst month is august and that's you know a hundred and six a hundred and ten a hundred and thirteen 

61.45 62.79 A: oh my gosh 

61.49 64.91 B: and you know so it gets pretty bad [laughter] 

64.53 65.40 A: huh 

64.95 65.66 B: i 

65.85 70.08 B: well i don't remember what the question was do heightened security or something 

68.09 69.18 A: it was uh 

69.50 74.72 A: [mn] yeah does airport heightened security stop the terrorism 

75.19 76.40 B: what do you think 

75.19 76.36 A: um 

77.75 81.88 A: yeah well i don't know i think it'll probably reduce it i mean it would definitely make 'em have to 

82.04 84.64 A: work a little harder at it i guess but 

85.29 89.12 B: [noise] yeah i think i i think it'll help as far as 

89.17 95.93 B: uh trying to cut back i don't think it's going to prevent it 'cause i think if it's going to happen it's going to be inevitable 

96.00 96.88 A: uh-huh 

96.14 97.28 B: um 

97.30 112.01 B: you know i travelled shortly after september the eleventh i travelled actually october i flew to san diego and i loved it actually it was a whole lot of fun um my problem with it was i had friends that were picking me up at the airport in 

111.90 124.69 B: phoenix and then the next day i was flying out to san diego and um when i got there it they weren't allowing my friends to come into the ai- not to the airport but to come into the terminal to like meet me 

124.67 132.31 B: and tell me where to go so it was it was a little difficult for me to find them you know it was easier for them to find me they knew where i was but i didn't know where they were 

124.90 125.97 A: oh yeah 

132.52 133.40 A: uh-huh 

132.59 137.83 B: and you know so that that's something that really kind of pissed me off but um 

138.52 140.52 B: other than that you know i 

140.95 152.92 B: i i really did enjoy the fact that you know they went through things and it took me longer to get through security it made me feel a little bit safer even though it happened you know less than a month before that i i did feel safer 

151.39 152.38 A: yeah 

152.74 165.90 B: um i did not feel uncomfortable in the air i didn't worry about somebody trying to take over the plane and fly us into a building um you know i i felt like it wa- it made me feel comfortable that's the thing that made was most important to me was me feeling 

165.90 169.41 B: okay whether or not it was going to happen like i said it's gonna be inevitable 

169.42 175.93 B: but um it just made me feel like they were doing their best to try to prevent it or try to uh 

169.97 170.66 A: uh-huh 

173.94 174.88 A: (( mhm )) 

175.96 178.52 B: you know at least reduce it 

178.54 182.40 A: yeah yeah i definitely a little safer in the airport now you know 

182.55 183.59 A: they've uh 

183.85 198.77 A: obviously taken the initiative and stuff and i mean i i see some people walking through and they get all pissed off and stuff at having to take off their shoes and everything but it doesn't really bother me when i think that you know it could stop somebody from putting a bomb in their shoe like that's 

198.81 200.23 A: (( um a good thing [laughter] yeah )) 

200.84 209.31 B: right you know i mean as far if you wanna kill yourself hey more power to ya don't wor- i mean i'm not gonna worry about you you do whatever the hell you wanna do but don't involve me 

209.31 210.67 A: right 

209.33 223.38 B: you know don't involve me and thirty five other people or a hundred other people you know don't take other people's lif- i mean 'cause look how many people they affected and you know it's not just the people that were on the planes it was their family and their family's families 

223.20 238.04 B: and you know it's just it's a chain reaction and so i'm glad that it's happening i'm gl- i'm not glad that happens but i i really think that it had to happen in order for us to beef up security and realise that we are a little to lax on things and we are 

229.01 229.81 A: yeah 

238.06 241.66 B: you know we don't really pay close attention to what's going on 

242.04 251.90 B: and you know we're like oh hell whatever you know do whatever you wanna do but in in all reality we're not under check we're not paying attention we're not knowing what's going on so 

242.42 243.32 A: yeah 

252.27 259.13 B: i you what i mean bad bad things happen to make you become aware but you know i think it was something that we needed 

259.92 268.90 B: and and like i said i'm glad it happened so i don't mind waiting in lines and i don't mind i mean because you're gonna wait anyway you're not it's not like flying is any faster than driving these days 

268.75 279.52 B: you know with your layover times and your waiting and and changing planes and you know flying to this airport that's absolutely nowhere near where you need to be um you know so 

269.07 270.08 A: oh yeah 

277.16 278.10 A: uh-huh 

279.77 284.01 B: i don't mind doing all that that doesn't bother me you know i think it's a good thing 

281.78 283.75 A: mhm well i won't 

283.93 288.56 A: yeah i won't take flights on short short trips anymore i'd rather just drive the eight hours than 

288.70 290.21 A: you know take an airplane 

290.36 291.84 B: yeah me too 

290.49 291.58 A: 'cause 

292.34 298.99 B: unless i can't fly there i mean unless i can't drive there you know like the bahamas i couldn't drive there 

292.69 293.87 A: yeah it's just too short 

295.72 296.51 A: (( mm )) 

298.83 310.50 A: right right or like new york you know coming from l._a. to new york man that's pretty impossible so um i'll take a plane there but like i won't i won't take a plane up to san francisco or anything that's that's a drag you know 

299.20 300.04 B: but 

304.22 305.08 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

310.57 312.90 B: yeah absolutely [mn] 

311.13 319.68 A: it's too much too much trouble going to the airport and you've gotta park your car and such a hassle getting from getting to the airport and everything now 

320.12 329.25 B: my boss left this morning or i'm sorry this afternoon to fly to oklahoma 'cause she's going to her niece's wedding or something like that and um 

320.30 321.60 A: and but 

329.42 337.27 B: she um was really nervous about the whole flying experience she was like you know she hasn't flown since before september the eleventh she hasn't 

337.13 349.75 B: gotten on a plane and i'm like you know i've flown shortly after that i've flown a few other times since then and it's nothing it's not a big deal not to mention the fact and i hate to say this but who in the hell is going to come to corpus christi texas 

349.87 351.53 B: and hijack a plane 

352.36 361.35 B: you know i mean y- nobody you know we're not on we're not know we're not on the map we're i mean we are on the map but you know we're not very we're 

352.62 355.16 A: (( mhm mm [laughter] yeah )) 

362.05 373.27 B: not a very wanted city we're not huge you know it's not gonna get them the publicity and it's so wrong of me to say but it's not gonna get them the whatever it is that they're looking for 

373.15 375.35 A: yeah that reaction they're looking for 

375.06 378.15 B: right because we're not a big city and 

377.22 381.52 A: i don't know though i mean i think that if they started attacking middle america it would be terrifying to 

381.55 382.56 A: 'cause then 

382.03 384.02 B: yeah that's true 

382.69 395.61 A: i mean it's like ev- everybody expects it in the city you know we're kind of a target but if they start attacking you know remote places where like uh you know in oklahoma or something where you know nobody thinks of themselves as being a target like i 

395.37 396.49 B: that's true 

395.91 409.52 A: mean once you hit the heartland then people start really getting freaked out 'cause if feels like everybody's is at risk you know i mean with new york you still in the twin towers and everything like that like they were hitting civilians and stuff we still sort of felt like they were 

396.57 397.84 B: that's very true 

409.95 417.15 A: you know they had some rhyme or reason to it they're going after a target that you know could possibly have some effect on their 

417.24 430.38 A: on their uh lives and whatever 'cause you know through world banking and stuff but if they start hitting like random mcdonalds in you know topeka then all of a sudden uh i don't know it just takes on a whole new level i think 

430.33 437.04 B: oh i agree that that's very true yeah you know and and and it it's gonna take something like that so 

431.46 432.43 A: yeah 

433.05 434.60 A: yeah so and 

437.68 441.47 B: god i hate saying that that makes me sound like such an ass but um i- 

441.61 450.31 B: i- i hate saying that that is what's it's gonna take to for it to impact us because like like what i just said you know who's gonna come in here and attack 

450.26 461.25 B: corpus christi texas but that's not true you know i m- they're gonna attack smaller planes or smaller cities and they're gonna go to places that people are gonna like me are never gonna suspect 

451.95 453.04 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

460.96 462.25 A: mhm 

461.63 463.21 B: and you know 

463.40 464.23 B: so 

464.55 465.55 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

464.58 470.04 B: horrible horrible things but as far as the security thing i i think it's wonderful that everything has 

466.59 467.33 A: (( mhm )) 

471.35 474.86 B: pepped up i guess the way it has you know uh 

473.59 474.97 A: mhm 

475.64 476.98 B: (( you know i )) 

475.93 480.75 A: yeah no i mean it is you know i i don't think they've been too invasive with the scary i mean 

481.01 489.26 A: they they've made done a pretty good job i think like when i was i was unshaven for a while and i always got stopped and you know whatever and it was kinda annoying but 

489.82 498.19 A: i mean really you think it doesn't really matter 'cause they'll al- you know if you're in a hurry they'll always let you go and if uh you know if you've got assigned seats like it 

494.74 496.86 B: (( don't know right )) 

498.22 501.42 A: doesn't really matter just makes a difference i guess you getting your luggage on 

501.80 506.00 A: (( but i don't know you know they're usually pretty good about it )) 

505.69 510.95 B: [noise] yeah which is still pretty scary 'cause you know they do let peop- i mean standing in line that day that i 

511.06 521.31 B: was talking about shortly after september the eleventh i i saw them you know searching people and it was not uh you're in a hurry i'm sorry you know you can go ahead and go it was 

521.15 526.43 B: you know i don't really care if you're in a hurry you're gonna stand here until i'm done with you because [mn] you know 

526.27 537.94 B: there's a hundred people that are getting ready to board this plane and i'm i'm responsible for their security you know and so i i could see that with these guy and that really made me feel better i mean there was security when i parked my truck 

538.09 548.67 B: you know people walking around driving around in golf carts constantly looking checking the parking lot seeing what's going on that made me feel a lot better made me feel a lot better 'cause i was parking my brand new truck there however but 

548.49 551.10 B: um it made me also feel better because 

551.10 564.23 B: you know it seemed like they were a little bit more concerned with what was going to enter the airport and who was gonna enter the airport and what that person looked like and you know and rather than sitting in a little air conditioned box waiting to see what's gonna happen 

565.13 569.10 B: you know so i was i was pretty impressed with that 

565.56 566.87 A: (( so mhm mm yeah )) 

568.31 570.74 A: yeah mhm mhm 

570.77 574.58 A: yeah seem to be a bunch of extra eyes out there uh keeping an eye on it 

574.90 575.91 A: it's good 

577.49 579.81 B: but yeah yeah so um what do you do for a living 

580.20 581.34 A: [noise] i'm a teacher 

581.50 582.63 B: oh really 

582.50 584.60 A: yeah yeah i teach uh 

584.75 587.10 A: maths and science to seventh graders so [mn] 

587.61 599.95 B: how funny i have a um i have an interest i was actually thinking about going into teaching but just because i want to move out of the city that i live in and that was a really accessible job and
