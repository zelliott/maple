1.83 8.22 B: hey this is uh larry field uh in michigan [noise] and i did not get the question that uh she asked 

8.35 9.56 B: did you catch it 

9.55 12.18 A: uh yes the question was um 

12.29 17.79 A: do you think that the present airport security lessens the chance of the terrorist incidents [noise] 

17.40 21.55 B: [noise] [noise] oh okay um [noise] i would say um 

21.44 32.82 B: um no to that phil because i was just at the airport they have increased security but i think it's not uh good enough 

25.68 26.62 A: mhm 

33.04 36.26 B: (( uh to [noise] decrease the )) 

36.37 40.67 B: the opportunity for terrorists to come into the country 

40.72 44.80 B: uh you know i it is a little better than than it was 

45.06 50.57 B: uh but i think if the terrorists want to get in there's still a lot of avenues [noise] 

50.67 55.37 B: at which they can uh come in you know [noise] and and 

55.70 63.61 A: yeah i would tend to agree with that and i would also tend to agree with uh tend to say that you know just even them trying to get on planes in particular 

56.02 56.87 B: you know 

63.59 64.47 B: mhm 

63.81 73.85 A: and trying to pull off another september eleventh or something like that i there's i mean every day not every day but you know really often you hear about people 

67.36 68.55 B: right 

74.13 83.27 A: who are you know they're like oh they got my nail clippers but they missed my bread knife or something like that and it's just like it's too spotty there's too many different ways you can hide things 

77.89 80.10 B: [noise] exactly exactly 

83.13 84.10 B: uh-huh 

83.14 90.06 A: and and what the just incredibly massive amount of people going through those gates 

87.49 88.98 B: yeah yeah 

89.95 92.98 B: and i don't think they'll ever be able 

93.21 99.26 B: you know to uh prevent [noise] totally prevent it uh you know you can look at israel 

96.41 97.30 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

99.23 110.46 B: and the security that they have [noise] over over there which is you know pretty good [noise] but they still not able to prevent [noise] you know a a terrorist attack 

110.10 111.28 A: (( yeah i mean )) 

110.88 115.00 B: (( you know i mean i i don't think we're gonna be able to do that either [noise] )) 

114.20 124.20 A: yeah i mean if anyone israel should be more prepared to deal with that kind of attacks isn't it like everyone over at the age of eighteen you have to spend two years in the in the army or something like that 

119.85 120.76 B: (( yeah )) 

123.62 125.15 B: right right [noise] 

124.31 130.32 A: so anyone any israeli who steps on a jet who was born in israel is gonna know something about how to defend themselves 

130.15 131.49 B: exactly 

130.61 132.32 A: and if they're still having 

132.33 135.06 A: terrorist incidents and stuff like that there's 

133.44 134.41 B: (( [noise] )) 

135.60 141.57 A: i don't think there's any way that we americans or anyone can so completely eliminate the threat 

137.41 139.03 B: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

141.29 148.03 B: i i don't think yeah and it especially answers the question what is uh directly dealing with our airport security 

147.90 149.35 A: yeah 

148.54 155.05 B: you know especially especially there [noise] you know because they've been able to slip things through the security now 

155.14 155.99 A: yeah 

155.32 156.46 B: [noise] you know 

156.49 165.03 B: you know so especially uh with our airport security now you know [noise] you still have many different [noise] nationality of people 

165.17 166.65 B: flying [noise] you know 

166.41 167.35 A: mhm 

166.76 170.96 B: (( and and uh [noise] you know there just ain't no telling who's gonna be on the plane )) 

171.14 172.24 A: (( yeah )) 

171.74 173.35 B: (( [noise] you know )) 

172.26 173.29 A: could be 

173.30 174.88 A: yeah it could be anybody 

174.81 176.38 B: right right ex- 

175.26 182.39 A: usually the people that are gonna do something bad or they look they don't look like you know they don't have a label on 'em this is a bad man or bad woman 

181.46 187.02 B: exactly exactly they they don't have a label on 'em you're right you're right 

185.33 196.10 A: and you know it could be anyone they could be like bringing their kids on a flight or something like that and you know sneaking something in with their kids who the guards are gonna be a maybe a little less likely to search as thoroughly so 

190.12 191.70 B: (( mm )) 

193.06 193.84 B: mhm 

196.05 202.07 B: mhm right [noise] right yeah i i don't think the uh equipment they have 

198.56 199.62 A: (( i don't know yeah )) 

202.30 213.06 B: i don't think they using the most advanced and sophis- sophisticated equipment you know that they could [noise] use i know they sound equipment like over in the 

213.22 219.75 B: most recent war [noise] we just had uh they had to walk through this scanner [noise] 

219.97 224.15 B: uh that was something like a see through thing you know 

223.44 224.72 A: mhm 

224.36 231.79 B: you know and so they were able to scan people saw right through their clothes and everything [noise] you know and uh you know 

228.50 229.38 A: yeah 

232.10 236.77 B: yeah yeah i guess if they went to that process [noise] here 

236.83 239.07 B: in the country it'd be a little better 

239.24 241.13 A: [noise] yeah but the 

240.26 245.26 B: but they just ain't no way they're gonna be able to so we gonna have to live with 

245.52 253.27 B: with the possiblity [noise] you know of something like nine eleven [noise] you know happening again 

251.23 252.19 A: yeah 

253.42 259.67 B: because of the time uh that we are living in you know evil 

260.14 263.06 B: evil men who always think of a way 

263.48 264.93 B: to do evil 

264.72 266.79 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

265.98 266.86 B: (( you know )) 

267.31 271.62 B: (( [noise] you know history proves that they'll always [noise] find a way to do evil [mn] )) 

272.02 273.90 A: yeah and if you have people 

274.15 280.57 A: getting searched like that i mean i'm sure you'd have to show up three hours ahead of time instead of just two like you do now and 

279.73 283.26 B: (( exactly exactly exactly mm )) 

281.48 285.08 A: the airlines would have such a they'd suffer so much that 

284.52 285.29 B: (( [noise] )) 

285.21 286.01 A: (( you know )) 

286.02 291.05 A: i don't know i don't even see how the [noise] sometimes i'm not even sure how the airlines stay in business [laughter] 

286.16 287.48 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

291.27 293.75 A: the way they have to drop prices and stuff like that 

291.70 292.98 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

293.71 297.13 B: (( [noise] right right right )) 

295.60 300.07 A: but i don't know i heard about a program called sky marshals it's supposed to be 

300.42 308.92 A: you know pretty good they put you know a a non uniformed federal agent on the pl- on a lot of planes now like they do it randomly 

300.91 302.08 B: [noise] 

302.41 303.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

307.20 308.17 B: mhm 

308.82 309.75 B: mhm 

309.29 310.67 A: to prevent any 

310.71 314.91 A: accidents or s- you know any prevent any hostile takeovers i 

314.81 315.72 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

315.05 326.13 A: mean it's just someone who just supposed to be look like anyone else and bu they're armed with a gun that shoots special rounds so that they won't go through the the wall of the planes and stuff like that but still knock people out 

319.58 320.60 B: (( yeah )) 

325.59 326.56 B: uh-huh 

326.64 329.71 B: so you know i guess you know [noise] i heard about a sky marsh- uh an 

329.86 331.36 B: operation too 

331.67 344.36 B: and i was [noise] just wondering how good is that [noise] you know [noise] yes yes they are being on the plane [noise] with them but you got one sky marshall and they have three or four you know [laughter] terrorists there 

341.45 342.26 A: yeah 

344.05 345.43 A: yeah that's true too 

345.10 356.38 B: you know so you wonder and you know what can one person do [noise] like i figure they just pull out the gun and start shooting [noise] on the plane but is that what you wanna do once you make the holes there you know [noise] 

356.46 360.61 A: yeah yeah well that's that's why they use they use special rounds they're actually bean bag rounds 

360.50 363.06 B: oh bean bag okay i didn't know that 

360.89 373.23 A: like yeah and it's like a little bean bag or it's like a rubber bullet they won't go through the it won't go through the the skin of the plane but it'll still knock a a pretty you know it'll knock someone or you know put him at least break a bunch of bones 

367.13 368.19 B: oh 

369.17 370.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

372.85 373.99 B: mhm 

373.67 374.59 A: but 

374.00 378.45 B: uh do have any what do you think uh that the country should do 

378.55 379.71 B: (( [noise] to prevent )) 

379.93 381.95 A: i don't know um [sigh] 

382.45 384.98 A: you can only do so much with 

385.38 386.35 A: the 

386.56 395.83 A: the searching and you can only do so much with the sky marshal program you know it'd cost a fortune to put somebody on every single plane uh a armed agent or something like that or even two or three 

395.49 396.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

396.10 397.43 A: i'm not sure 

397.40 398.25 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

398.09 405.47 A: that there's really much you can do i mean i know some countries have resorted to they've put two guys on the plan with ak47s you 

399.84 401.28 B: right right 

404.97 407.23 B: whoa they're gonna blow a hole 

405.64 406.39 A: know 

406.74 411.13 A: [laughter] it's it's just a big visible show of power so 

407.62 408.68 B: (( [laughter] )) 

410.64 411.59 B: uh-huh 

411.55 412.54 A: that way 

411.73 412.40 B: (( mm )) 

413.00 417.82 A: you know if anyone tries anything they're like well you know you can try something but you're probably gonna get blown away 

417.83 426.21 B: yeah i get that philosophy is not bad you know if if the uh the evil people you know see [noise] see it you know 

426.27 435.41 B: uh then they prob- probably would not try it it's like i know uh in some of the big cities when they have a major they bring a lot of officers out you know 

435.10 436.18 A: yeah 

435.61 441.49 B: uniforms so that you know they can be seen that will help deter you know violence 

441.45 442.68 A: mhm 

442.07 444.94 B: so i guess that would uh would if 

445.64 448.59 B: you know they know the people are there you know 

448.24 449.46 A: yeah 

448.90 454.47 B: but i don't think our current uh show of 

454.51 459.53 B: manpower that we have right now will will will put in the uh 

460.77 465.00 B: oh security people at the airport on a federal uh 

465.49 467.38 B: uh authority you know 

465.64 466.67 A: (( yeah )) 

467.14 468.33 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

467.70 474.88 B: i don't see any i don't see any major changes i was just i just you know flew back from uh philadelphia 

475.44 476.84 B: and uh 

476.91 483.02 B: you know it it wasn't too much uh different [noise] than what i used to go through you know [noise] i went through the scanner [noise] 

483.37 486.93 B: (( you know they look at this they look at that [noise] when i went through you know )) 

485.12 486.17 A: yeah 

487.77 490.95 B: but there wasn't too much difference than what i've been before 

489.60 490.44 A: yeah 

490.74 495.14 A: i actually flew for the first time back last spring 

495.17 496.21 B: mhm 

495.62 500.45 A: and i had a series of flights i had like three connections each way 

500.51 509.48 A: and um i was flying down to mexico and i'd never seen security beforehand but it seemed relatively tight to me but everyone else said oh it's about the same 

500.69 502.06 B: (( mm )) 

509.40 517.78 A: you know they actually pulled me aside and they put the they made me put you know stand with my arms outstretched and they passed the wand over my body and everything i was like 

509.62 510.30 B: (( [noise] )) 

515.39 517.46 B: (( [mn] mm )) 

517.93 519.90 A: (( okay [laughter] yeah mhm )) 

518.52 524.23 B: mm [laughter] you know i guess see i don't mind [noise] you know the extra security [noise] 

523.90 524.81 A: yeah 

524.22 537.78 B: uh you know i don't mind going through extra security in regard to you know to protect you know this country you know and the people in this country i don't mind that all i don't mind being uh little inconvenient you know 

537.83 539.29 B: for security reasons [noise] 

539.69 544.63 B: you know uh and i don't i think most americans [noise] doesn't mind either 

544.82 545.82 B: you know if 

546.38 547.65 B: (( [noise] they're going through )) 

548.40 550.97 B: going through extra stuff for the protection of 

551.41 552.80 B: of this country 

552.44 564.17 A: yeah i doubt it that anyone would mind too much but you know there's there's always gonna be a way to get weapons on there they have they have they have actual guns that are made out of ceramic 

553.52 554.11 B: (( yeah )) 

560.76 562.15 B: (( oh yeah mm )) 

564.11 565.32 B: mhm 

564.69 579.11 A: so there's n- there's so little or zero metal in them that they can go right through a really sensitive you know metal scanner and no one will even know i mean with this body scan thing you're talking about if they can look for hard objects maybe but 

569.75 571.41 B: (( mm )) 

578.43 579.20 B: but 

579.45 580.25 A: (( you know )) 

580.05 592.19 B: you know gen- they're like the hackers on the computer yeah they always figuring out how to hack into things they're like you're right they're like these terrorists they always gonna figure out you know how to beat the system 

582.68 583.74 A: yeah 

585.34 587.14 A: yup there's always a way around 

593.14 598.24 B: you know like the car thieves they always figure out how to steal the car [noise] you know [laughter] you know 

595.56 599.95 A: mhm [laughter] yeah it might might take a little longer maybe a little more compli-
