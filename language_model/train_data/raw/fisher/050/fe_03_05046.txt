0.12 1.74 A: kevin george 

1.43 3.38 B: i'm michelle christianson 

3.70 12.05 B: um i wasn't aware of any recent strikes by professional athletes so [laughter] do you know like what specific sports they're talking about 

8.83 9.91 A: mhm 

11.43 26.04 A: you know what i i have no clue what either way no matter what sport they're talking about i think it's stupid 'cause for the money that they get paid why are you going to go on strike what for i mean people are being greedy to tell you the truth i mean if i got paid that much money i 

25.13 29.80 B: [laughter] well yeah that's true but i mean in one c- i think in baseball they are considering that oh 

29.78 44.24 B: weren't they um negotiating about like drug testing and stuff like that for some of the athletes and in that case if it's like more of a i don't know if it's not necessarily it it can be for other things for their safety or 

34.32 36.15 A: mhm 

42.05 43.11 A: right 

43.87 54.24 A: but seriously i mean if okay if you got paid i mean some some of these guys are getting paid what like twenty something million uh you know a year okay i mean 

52.31 53.45 B: (( yeah for a )) 

54.30 63.45 A: y- y- are you going to go and strike it and say i want more money i mean while people are dying and and they need food and they're starving and they're i mean what the hell's that right 

62.86 69.52 B: oh i know i don't think really anyone feel otherwise about the strikes of professional athletes i mean usually they're hated by they end 

69.23 70.41 A: yeah 

69.76 72.08 B: and i mean i'm in minnesota and i think 

72.24 78.73 B: oh they weren't striking they were the twins were threatening to move to texas for a while because [noise] 

77.70 87.67 A: well see that that's the that's i think that's all bull why you why you gotta threat i mean i could understand if if the coaches treated you like crap or something or like 

87.30 88.12 B: uh-huh 

87.66 98.93 A: but but they need evidence but i don't see any of that i mean if if they have proven evidence like my coach treats me like crap you know he does this he does that and that's why i want to move sure but if they say you don't pay me enough 

90.27 91.21 B: (( mhm )) 

98.78 109.47 B: oh no it was it was in more like it was the whole team that was threatening to [noise] the managers and everything were were going to sell the team or move the team to texas if they didn't get another stadium built 

103.27 104.70 A: and did did they have 

109.61 112.69 A: [noise] oh that's what it was all about 

111.02 124.90 B: yeah yeah it was and it they would been like the se- and they uh and ended up staying and they ended up staying in the same stadium so i'm not sure what really happened with that [laughter] i mean i guess they just caved because i mean people really started to hate them when that happened so yeah 

124.31 125.57 A: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

125.82 132.31 A: yeah [sigh] well i guess that's what it's all about then i thought it was just single or individual uh 

132.57 135.35 A: [noise] individual players striking 

134.75 138.65 B: oh really i don't i've never heard of single or individual players striking 

138.49 141.10 A: all right 'cause i'll be really really dumb 

141.15 143.61 A: but the whole team yeah that 

142.25 150.69 B: [noise] no i i think i think they're talking more about like group players' strikes when they're like doing like for the lowest salary 

146.61 147.51 A: okay 

150.40 151.47 A: (( mm )) 

150.91 163.30 B: like the base not i- it's usually not the like star players that are striking 'cause they already get paid it's more like the sort of like minimum i mean the minimum's [noise] still pretty high but like the minimum waged players 

162.69 163.99 A: right 

163.45 164.24 B: right 

164.64 166.06 A: i know what you're saying now 

165.67 167.41 B: yeah i mean but they still 

167.30 171.46 A: but how do i feel about that i think if they have a good reason 

171.49 173.49 A: to do it and they have evidence 

174.43 179.42 A: then it's all good then they can go ahead and strike but i mean if they're just going to do it con- to do it i mean that's 

179.71 181.20 A: you know i think that's absurd 

181.05 183.47 B: yeah basically it's just for cash [laughter] 

183.17 185.34 A: right that's i think that's bull [sigh] 

185.59 195.67 A: to tell you the truth i think that the the players should uh contribute more to charity and stuff like that they have enough money to do it why the hell not or they should all just pitch in and buy themselves a damn stadium i mean 

190.42 191.31 B: uh-huh 

195.07 196.36 B: [laughter] 

195.74 203.71 A: why not right they get they get paid how much i mean how much do they get paid seriously i mean do you think you think wouldn't you think they could buy their own stadium 

196.52 197.86 B: yeah of course 

203.72 209.49 B: um probably not stadiums are like [mn] [noise] billions of dollars [laughter] [laughter] 

204.54 205.93 A: pit- pitching in 

207.51 214.44 A: a jillion dollars yeah right you're right but how have 'em have 'em go travel to like nearby parks and play there 

214.24 215.42 B: [laughter] 

214.56 216.24 A: that'd e that'd be cool 

215.81 217.45 B: yeah definitely 

217.15 226.94 A: yeah but i think i think the whole strike thing is absurd they should just be cool with it like i said unless they have a really good reason for it and they have evidence and then they're they can strike all they want 

226.86 233.60 B: well yeah it's kind of the the purpose of striking was never meant [laughter] to be applied to [laughter] professional athletes 

230.54 232.71 A: just to be right 

232.91 234.40 A: yeah i guess you're right [sigh] 

234.45 237.93 B: kind of weird when they took it and and applied it to themselves so 

237.14 241.70 A: but but yeah so anyway what is this whole phone call right now you guys are going to study the way i talk or is that it or 

237.95 238.53 B: (( [laughter] ))

247.79 248.79 A: yes 

248.22 256.11 B: yeah i think it's [noise] i think it's actually probably a phone company doing it because you know when you in the beginning when you have to push like 

256.40 266.72 B: uh what kind of headset you're using or what kind of i- i'm wondering if it's like some cell phone company doing the study on linguistics or something that's funding it [noise] but i kind of made that up so i don't know [sigh] [mn]
