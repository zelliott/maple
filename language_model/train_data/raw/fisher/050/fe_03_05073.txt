2.52 3.97 B: hi this is carol 

3.62 5.21 A: hi carol i'm paul 

5.16 11.26 B: nice to meet you um i'm not sure exactly what the top- topic was was it something about airport security 

10.96 16.54 A: ((  )) 

15.93 18.58 B: um i have mixed feelings i think 

19.54 22.81 B: yes and no i think it's more time consuming 

24.03 25.42 B: um than 

25.82 27.15 B: (( than safe )) 

27.16 37.97 A: ((  )) 

33.95 35.28 B: right right 

37.76 48.40 B: i don't i don't really think the security's there i think that it's there on some airports like maybe uh j._f._k. and like l._a._x. but certain smaller airports i mean there is security but not as much 

49.51 56.91 B: um because i actually took a razor blade and like a knife on the plane after nine eleven and you know they searched my bag 

56.98 59.67 B: and it was actually in there and you know 

59.73 63.15 B: it it was only a ra- a razor blade but they didn't do anything about it 

62.64 64.51 A: ((  )) 

63.99 66.17 B: no they didn't they skimmed 

69.02 73.43 A: ((  )) 

73.48 74.48 B: excuse me 

73.92 78.31 A: ((  )) 

77.85 78.66 B: yeah 

79.07 83.57 B: i did but then i would you know leave it behind it was just a razor blade to 

84.01 87.32 B: you know for f- females with 'cause some of us shave our eyebrows 

86.82 88.48 A: ((  )) 

88.05 94.37 B: so it was uh it wasn't a huge razor blade it wasn't you know but i took a razor blade um on the plane and then 

94.71 98.37 B: um i just took a little knife on the plane just to see 

98.82 100.89 B: just to see if they would do anything 

100.03 102.25 A: (( quite a while since i've been on an airplane so )) 

101.64 102.95 B: it was an experiment 

102.98 104.31 A: (( i'm i don't have any first )) 

103.81 106.04 B: and i got away with it at j._f._k. 

106.75 108.87 A: (( hand experience with at least what you've seen that )) 

109.01 111.61 B: and i my bag was searched about three times 

109.13 110.34 A: (( makes it kind of har- is )) 

111.87 112.99 A: (( that during the higher )) 

112.92 114.52 B: that had the knife in it 

114.29 116.45 A: (( security alerts or doesn't that matter well )) 

116.22 119.75 B: no it was just in a regular pocket and they just felt around 

120.32 126.21 B: um and it was mixed with other you know computer disks there was in my like a carrier with a laptop 

126.23 128.22 B: so it was checked many times 

129.15 131.46 B: and for some reason it passed through fine 

131.47 134.19 A: ((  )) 

135.08 137.25 A: (( that things got even more tight )) 

135.14 138.84 B: i was curious to see what right i was actually curious to see 

139.25 140.72 A: (( when uh oh )) 

140.43 146.52 B: because i know if i had carried it on they would say well i'm sorry you know you're going to have to leave this behind you have to toss it into like a waste bin 

146.62 148.32 A: mhm 

147.60 148.41 B: (( um )) 

149.00 151.68 B: and i guess i was curious just because 

152.09 156.30 B: i wanted to see ho- exactly how safer how much safer it was 

156.22 158.15 A: (( i'm in indiana )) 

158.33 159.78 A: (( where are you new )) 

160.06 161.95 A: (( york you would you would have first )) 

161.84 167.71 B: everybody else was searched as much ones that had laptops were searched more diligently than 

162.02 162.73 A: (( hand )) 

167.80 169.98 B: you know um everybody else 

170.84 175.28 B: and i had those two items in my you know carry on with my laptop 

175.47 177.16 B: [laughter] so it's kind of obvious 

177.84 179.71 A: (( experience yeah i'm i'm )) 

178.50 182.95 B: [noise] um so i guess actually that my my idea of it kind of changed 

183.26 184.63 A: (( sort of right )) 

183.77 189.58 B: i'm sure after nine eleven after maybe three or four months they were extremely careful they checked everything 

190.59 191.99 A: (( in the center )) 

191.53 194.82 B: um i i think they do but they've gotten a little more careless 

195.39 196.25 A: (( of )) 

197.56 202.96 A: (( the united states just about and i was i was curious if in )) 

203.53 206.35 B: supposedly that's well that's what they tell us right 

203.86 204.99 A: (( new york uh )) 

205.63 208.16 A: (( when you fly uh do they do they do )) 

208.48 211.16 A: (( they profile that you that you're aware )) 

212.09 213.27 A: (( of do they )) 

213.36 215.68 A: (( pull people aside that maybe look arabic )) 

215.80 220.39 B: it's the extra time and then there's money 'cause there's extra taxes being paid for it 

220.49 221.46 A: (( or )) 

221.32 228.05 B: yeah there's a lot of security taxes that are added on to your plane fare but before it's like an extra i think thirty dollars more 

221.71 222.46 A: (( or )) 

228.06 233.33 B: and there's like a security fee and then there's a check fee and some other there's just a 

233.69 236.33 B: number of fees that are added on 

237.16 239.33 A: (( suspicious like out of line or mhm )) 

239.36 240.54 B: yes i did 

240.27 244.14 A: (( that makes it very hard on the child really and this is in view have you ever seen anyone taken elsewhere )) 

243.87 244.94 B: (( uh )) 

244.27 245.77 A: (( like into a room no )) 

245.93 252.31 B: no it the search i didn't i wasn't really searched aft- before nine eleven they passed mine through uh 

252.53 255.13 B: you know is that your dog it sounds cute in the back 

254.51 256.27 A: (( do you ever go outside )) 

255.48 256.96 B: (( [laughter] um )) 

257.05 260.90 B: you know it was it was just checked maybe like one not 

260.94 265.19 B: even not to the point where everything was open and checked for you know 

265.34 266.12 B: (( um )) 

266.59 271.05 B: clothing everything [sigh] it wasn't that way before nine eleven 

272.53 278.03 A: (( the country i wondered if maybe if you'd well i don't i guess if you're in new york depending on where you are uh )) 

278.24 280.94 A: (( new york city well i was thinking maybe if you )) 

281.96 283.12 A: (( hopped across to canada )) 

282.04 289.47 B: [noise] well you you're fortunate because it does take time and you know you kind of start getting restless um some places you have to take off your shoes 

289.67 294.12 A: (( there might even be tighter security because you could be that's pretty int- that's kind )) 

293.73 295.56 B: (( uh taking your shoes off )) 

295.22 301.59 A: (( of sad in a way that if um their security's so much better well of course they haven't had the the type )) 

297.97 298.93 B: right 

301.69 308.11 B: i haven't flown in the last month so i'm not sure um the last time i flew was back in april 

301.88 303.03 A: (( of terrorism )) 

304.18 305.42 A: (( i don't )) 

307.59 308.76 A: (( think that's )) 

310.23 313.03 B: i'm sure it's gotten a lot tighter where are you calling from 

313.10 315.55 A: (( occurred here not that i can remember yeah mm that's that's )) 

314.90 316.24 B: i'm in new york 

315.89 319.22 A: (( pretty interesting i don't really have any first hand experience with )) 

317.03 323.69 B: in manhattan so no the reason why i asked is because i have you know when i go outside there's a lot of national guard and the army military 

324.04 326.12 B: um for the last few weeks 

326.60 329.70 B: you know in this area so i was just wondering where you were calling from oh

365.05 370.52 B: um just like a regular family man he had like a son with him uh and he was pulled aside 

370.75 372.82 B: and he was obviously he was being checked

381.18 382.64 A: (( this is the )) 

382.78 394.60 B: this is in view because we're all standing in line and um there's a security you know guard that comes up and kind of pulls one side and so we're all standing in line waiting to be checked by somebody else 

395.28 399.05 B: and there's about you know and and they get pulled to the side and you actually see this in view

511.48 515.04 B: (( disconnect or you know to say goodbye to the person you're talking to )) 

515.20 519.10 B: and then they log on that i guess you get credited for what you talked about

519.04 523.06 A: (( ask about you know if you're talking from a handset )) 

524.07 525.55 A: (( or speakerphone )) 

524.86 532.12 B: um well the three topics so far well the first one was on terrorism you know what i thought about the whole terrorism 

532.39 537.18 B: uh i think maybe it's because i live in new york that i get targeted with these questions 

547.53 548.31 B: so 

549.53 550.53 B: (( i'm )) 

551.18 552.26 B: sure

562.59 563.54 B: (( a )) 

567.03 568.30 A: yeah that's 

568.47 572.53 B: linguistic there's some linguistic value that's being monitored 

572.95 577.45 A: sounds like an interesting program where the topic is terrorism or airport security 

577.88 578.86 B: right 

578.57 581.46 A: get to get to learn about other people's thoughts on things 

580.90 585.70 B: right which is kind of interesting to see how you introduce yourself and you and you talk about it 

581.61 583.50 A: outside the general area 

586.34 590.74 B: so but yeah um they know you're supposed to like stay within the topic 

590.83 593.61 B: (( i mean no one tells you to stay with it at but )) 

593.17 596.02 A: so it's always rand- you don't even have a clue when you 

595.27 599.95 B: i have no clue they'll call me up and they'll you know if they call you they'll say okay
