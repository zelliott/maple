82.73 85.08 A: ((  )) 

85.49 90.41 A: (( security which uh has been echoed the thing of it is i think that it would reflect the amount of passengers )) 

89.87 91.16 B: exactly 

90.70 93.16 A: (( in airports which is lax )) 

93.65 95.12 A: (( because individuals are concerned if they )) 

95.18 96.50 B: exactly 

96.05 101.80 A: (( felt that if this if the american people felt that airport security was a )) 

101.83 103.23 A: (( secure thing there'd be more )) 

103.43 107.37 A: (( individuals that'd be going from to and fro and we wouldn't have this particular )) 

108.02 109.26 A: (( mess )) 

109.74 112.35 A: (( okay so evidently there's a consensus )) 

112.35 113.60 B: i agree 

112.67 123.76 A: (( at least somewhat that uh airport security is not up to parr wouldn't you agree with that and tampa being um one of the biggest one of the international airports you know )) 

124.32 127.20 A: (( we have everybody coming in from every country there )) 

126.79 127.70 B: right 

127.52 133.64 A: ((  )) 

133.83 138.28 B: well you know on campus pretty much i i yeah i do 

135.51 137.36 A: ((  )) 

138.64 141.49 B: (( mhm yes right okay right exactly )) 

141.85 162.24 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

162.05 169.65 A: from me well do you remember some incidents where for example uh they found things uh later on when uh 

169.85 173.47 A: you know individuals had already boarded like one gentleman had a gun 

174.09 176.83 A: there were some incidents like that um 

177.05 178.61 A: you know uh 

179.29 180.12 A: (( huh huh )) 

180.40 184.65 A: you know the thing of it is is that you know other countries 

184.83 187.18 A: uh have better security than we do 

187.32 190.25 A: okay as far as airlines are concerned 

190.82 195.80 A: and uh it's all the it depends on your priority you know what i mean and um 

197.04 204.18 A: you know airport security's gotta be one of the most imprio- important things priority wise and if you gotta pay more 

204.27 213.19 A: you know then i suppose you'd have to okay [mn] they may be sensitive about the airline ticket but you know 

213.29 214.01 A: (( [mn] huh )) 

214.49 217.26 A: would someone qui- you know be uh 

217.28 221.80 A: you know uh vacillating about airline tickets 

221.98 225.40 A: when uh they may get blown up in the air 

226.02 238.13 A: i mean i i know money's important but you know but your your life is more important than money and so so are your fellow uh uh citizens here i mean you can't put a price tag on these 

238.14 240.17 A: citizens in this country 

239.84 243.03 B: i agree i would definitely pay more to be safer 

242.98 249.02 A: well that that's one of the things they c- they claimed was a difficulty before nine eleven 

243.47 244.22 B: (( but )) 

249.31 255.85 A: that the airlines were sensitive to the fact that individuals may not wanna pay 

255.95 258.34 A: you know to increase security 

257.93 258.82 B: right 

258.49 266.32 A: uh but the fa- see it's not really up to the con- see the problem is is that when you have a federally run 

267.21 268.67 A: (( you know uh )) 

269.29 276.24 A: s- situation which in this case is airlines it's not up to me or you or anybody here 

271.77 272.59 B: right 

276.52 283.31 A: uh but the federal government if the federal governments told the airlines which they should've done a long time ago 

283.80 288.45 A: you are going to do this or you're not going to fly okay which they can do 

287.25 288.16 B: right 

288.33 289.78 B: yeah 

289.19 302.01 A: um you know in other words you're gonna install this machine and you're gonna install that machine and you're gonna have this german shepherd you know stationed here and that german shepherd stationed there and you're gonna do the things 

302.02 305.79 A: that are gonna incorporate a very secure 

305.86 318.53 A: as much as possible situation and granted unfortunately it may cost you know extra money which is unf- no one wants that we don't want that either the federal government 

317.95 318.79 B: right 

318.64 321.08 A: but the you know i- [sigh] 

321.22 330.21 A: the m- health and safety are the number one priority so you can't you just can't 

330.50 333.86 A: you know uh comp- the word is compromise 

334.02 336.34 A: that situation wouldn't you agree 

336.53 348.51 B: [lipsmack] i agree but i think a lot that affects that is the stock owners you know they don't get a lot of return on their investment and if they have to give up 

348.55 351.41 B: have their you know part of their investment 

349.86 353.25 A: but that's where but see that's this is where 

353.44 356.22 A: you know the federal government you know 

356.44 358.69 A: has to be stern you know 

358.40 359.63 B: i agree 

359.00 363.32 A: i mean they are in ch- they're actually in charge of the airlines 

363.45 367.10 A: and they've got the final word as to what goes on with an airline 

367.56 382.07 A: and they they should tell the airlines you know monetary you know matters are important and no one wants to um create a problem monetarily but we don't have an alternative and you're gonna do as we say because you have to 

382.01 385.03 B: but yeah you're right there is no alternative 

384.94 393.43 A: [sigh] no you know it's a m- like i said a matter of priority and your systems safety is top number one 

393.67 400.11 A: priority over anything over monetary monetary is secondary 

400.34 402.05 A: and the people's health 

402.37 405.84 A: uh and [mn] if there's animals on board their health 

405.36 406.60 B: (( [mn] right )) 

406.26 409.46 A: uh is number one by law by the way 

409.80 412.71 A: by law as we s- talk now 

412.98 419.12 A: it's uh it would be against federal law and state law to jeopardize any humans or any animals 

413.51 414.09 B: (( yeah )) 

419.20 421.51 A: uh that are on board the plane 

421.57 431.51 B: do you think um the yeah do you think the law well i don't know whether it's actually actually a law but y- do you think by allowing the pilots to carry weapons 

422.53 423.41 A: right 

430.73 434.40 A: no not a good thing not a good thing 

431.90 433.67 B: i think that ending- 

433.96 437.18 B: i think that endangers us as passengers as well 

436.19 440.26 A: well sure well sure because you see for one thing 

440.35 442.54 A: i agree with ya because 

442.86 444.81 A: you know [sigh] 

446.04 450.74 A: i'll tell you what they they did come up with a plan for air marshals okay 

450.35 451.22 B: right 

450.75 452.98 A: these are plain clothes individuals 

453.07 455.84 A: sitting on a plane no one knows who they are 

455.98 458.31 A: they're packing weapons okay 

458.23 459.66 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

458.76 465.09 A: but they're there for a purpose they're there because in case someone becomes irate or starts a problem 

465.18 468.35 A: they're going to be able to cope with that problem 

467.89 473.36 B: right but they have their training as well to um diffuse a problem without weapons if necessary 

472.57 476.43 A: very good and they may have some tear uh spray on 'em or whatever 

476.12 477.21 B: right 

476.59 484.56 A: but it's s- again we get into the monetary because th- the thing of it is but you you know it has t- this is something that has to be done 

484.87 485.91 B: i agree 

485.45 489.77 A: you have to have individuals on the plane that no one knows 

490.01 494.78 A: that are those type of people that could handle a situation if it arose 

494.98 500.89 B: i agree with that but on the same hand because i live in an area where i fly in and out a lot 

501.27 512.06 B: if you go to the same cities you'll often time become familiar with the person on there that no one is supposed to know so i think they need to switch those around a lot more often 

512.07 513.60 A: what's i'm sorry 

513.61 516.27 B: um because i fly in and out a lot 

516.28 522.95 B: i'm familiar with people that also fly in and out a lot so by flying frequently 

521.38 525.91 A: they see the same person in other words and they can recognize the individual 

523.43 524.50 B: right 

525.28 526.47 B: yes 

526.45 535.75 A: yeah but there's an al- okay so would you consider an alternating you know situation where these individuals may be getting in other planes and stuff like that 

531.56 532.71 B: definitely 

535.17 539.01 B: right i don't think they should be on the same route every time 

538.99 540.13 A: uh-huh 

540.24 542.25 A: uh okay well that's you know 

542.70 545.61 A: that's good but see but listen to this though okay 

545.29 546.18 B: okay 

545.73 552.66 A: since nine eleven all right this nation has not suffered a an attack like that 

552.51 553.50 B: true 

553.20 556.03 A: okay the united states luckily 

556.34 562.40 A: since that tragic accident has not suffered another accident similarly 

562.45 564.94 A: through hijacking or whatever 

565.48 567.96 A: now we gotta say that right 

567.50 570.69 B: yeah right and you have to wonder why that is also 

568.24 568.95 A: (( but )) 

570.15 573.66 A: well part of it is probably because of airport security 

574.35 584.49 A: and part of it may be the vigilance of of the passengers because let's say for example you're on a plane if somebody is acting rather bizarrely okay bizarre 

584.17 585.22 B: right 

584.81 587.03 A: you may take notice about that now 

586.43 588.29 B: oh definitely 

587.31 591.56 A: and you make re- record tell the stewardess or anyone 

591.79 596.36 A: uh who's a uh you know person that works for this particular airline 

596.85 599.89 A: that there you think there's something that could be you know going on
