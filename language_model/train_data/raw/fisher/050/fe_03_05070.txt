5.71 7.23 A: my name is tanmoy 

8.06 10.90 B: and uh i guess we're talking about 

11.01 12.14 B: whether 

12.17 18.16 B: salaries of sports figures are justified or not [noise] is that what you got 

17.59 20.11 A: yeah that's what i thought it was

50.62 58.33 B: um that to get such a large salary in addition to uh all that seems 

59.05 65.87 B: pretty [sigh] unjustified to i mean to the point where the average person can't afford to go to a game any more 

65.84 70.68 A: [noise] yeah i mean i think they should cut the salaries down and lower the ticket prices 

70.08 76.64 B: yeah exactly if they have to raise ticket prices just to come up with those salaries then it uh 

76.95 80.37 B: it seems like things have gotten out of hand 

80.25 84.54 A: yeah then especially these you know young kids which come out 

84.59 85.59 B: mhm 

84.89 92.18 A: and they get signed on with million dollars in a multi million dollar deal you know i think it's really ridiculous 

90.14 91.11 B: (( yeah )) 

91.91 94.54 B: they're not worth that i mean 

93.49 96.09 A: and they haven't even proved themselves you know 

95.50 101.70 B: right right that's a sign to me that there's too much money available 

102.05 108.74 B: uh to be able to offer that in the first place you know because they expect to be able to receive those 

109.34 112.15 B: uh proceeds from ticket sales [noise]

138.24 139.59 B: and uh 

139.83 142.72 B: you know that is being 

143.09 145.30 B: simply because of greed
