370.29 372.38 B: [mn] i i guess uh 

372.56 385.82 B: everyone uh like the a._c._l._u. a lot of these rights organizations are you know crying foul with the bush administration with the oh they're impeding on our rights but i guess you gotta be a little bit flexible you know based on 

384.77 386.04 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

385.95 388.58 B: nine eleven you pretty much have to uh 

386.63 387.41 A: (( yeah [mn] [noise] )) 

388.71 390.19 B: (( you know it )) 

390.26 399.26 B: let your rights flex a little bit you know just to be a little bit safer for now and then things will probably go back you know things will just naturally i think relax 

392.13 393.17 A: yeah 

398.88 399.70 A: (( yeah yeah [noise] )) 

400.16 402.92 B: and then i always hear people talk about uh

407.28 412.35 B: i don't know don't stand up for their rights uh don't deserve their rights or something like that 

410.01 410.81 A: yeah 

411.64 413.14 A: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

413.21 426.46 B: 'cause uh i don't get that kind of argument but some people are just idealistic i don't know [mn] an- and uh won't compromise you know they're just so firm in their beliefs either way you know
