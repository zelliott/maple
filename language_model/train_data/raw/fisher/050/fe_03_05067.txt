6.95 8.10 B: hi ralph 

8.32 13.09 A: so what do you think about uh [sigh] professional a- athletes going on strike [noise] 

13.67 14.88 B: um 

15.25 16.32 B: i think 

16.72 18.30 B: i think they shouldn't 

18.38 20.31 A: you think they shouldn't 

19.76 20.81 B: yeah 

20.42 27.02 A: yeah i think that uh they get paid millions of dollars and i think that i pay that i pay money to go to 

27.15 38.29 A: all the uh sporting events and i have season tickets to some teams and i think it's ridiculous that there is any reason that they should ever have to go on strike you ever been to a you go to games 

37.69 44.88 B: um sometimes i do my son he goes a lot yeah and we just got uh a new stadium here 

40.54 41.60 A: yeah 

44.92 47.04 B: i'm in um cincinnati 

46.49 50.31 A: okay i'm in philadelphia we're also getting new stadiums too 

47.12 48.46 B: paul brown stadium 

50.73 57.29 A: and uh yeah i have season tickets to the eagles and i go to pretty much all the f- all four major league sports teams 

56.93 57.85 B: mhm 

57.35 71.02 A: and uh i know that [sigh] i i think it's absolutely ridiculous that there's any reason that they should ever have to go on strike just because of the fact that the uh oth- if you just look at their minimum salaries that uh are six figures 

70.38 71.38 B: right 

70.98 79.53 A: and that they're actually i think the lowest there uh lowest minimum salary for any any sport is at least two hundred thousand dollars and 

78.62 79.95 B: wow 

79.51 91.18 A: when i think it's actually about two hundred and fifty thousand so if uh they would you know decide to go on strike for because they they can't there there's just no there's no reason i can see them ever going on strike i mean 

89.41 90.34 B: right 

91.22 93.48 A: the owners you know say that 

93.49 103.48 A: the players make too much money and uh the players i guess say the owners make too much money but actually i guess the owners [sigh] the owners the only reason the owners would not uh i guess 

95.07 96.16 B: mhm 

103.49 108.99 A: um let strikes happen is because of the fact that the salaries just go too high you said you were in cincinnati 

107.76 108.48 B: right 

108.64 109.83 B: yes 

109.20 114.07 A: yeah 'cause yeah i mean so do you you go to the reds games yeah 

110.06 110.68 B: (( [mn] )) 

112.56 115.18 B: yes yeah i like going to the reds game 

114.70 116.66 A: and the uh [sigh] i think 

115.84 117.17 B: and the bengals 

116.72 119.69 A: yeah the bengals huh you like going to the bengals games 

117.93 122.05 B: [laughter] no [laughter] 

120.18 127.24 A: [laughter] yeah just the fact that uh you know teams like the like the yankees with george steinbrenner where they just basically 

127.18 137.46 A: uh he can he has bottomless pockets and he can just pay for any athlete he wants and they take they take athletes from uh other countries and uh you know they they 

132.29 133.52 B: exactly 

136.27 137.72 B: mhm 

137.33 147.88 A: they take defectors from different areas and you know pay them outrageous money and and uh it actually things like that actually that's the only reason i can see 

147.93 152.10 A: i guess any athlete would ever go on strike is because of that well 

152.23 154.97 A: that's actually an owners issue is the i [noise] 

154.49 160.45 B: i mean where do they get these deals for um uh gym shoes lawn mowers whatever you know 

158.06 158.96 A: mhm 

159.51 167.82 A: yeah lebron james just got a uh nine- signed a ninety million dollar contract with uh nike and he hasn't even graduated high school yet 

167.40 171.68 B: and they get cute and they don't want to sign autographs and things like that 

169.79 170.75 A: mhm 

171.22 177.84 A: and they get cocky and then uh you know people like us that work every day and pay to go to these games and 

177.10 179.44 B: and make their careers [laughter] exactly 

178.07 181.12 A: right and watch the t._v. are the ones that suffer because they don't 

181.15 186.85 A: you know they they even if they go on strike for a year they the money they make before that it's 

186.88 197.41 A: it's not re- it's if they have any kind of sense at all any kind of financial sense they're able to stock money away and it really doesn't affect them so they have they pretty much have all the bargaining power 

197.44 204.71 A: and uh i- it's it's really just an issue where uh the people that are affected are people that have no say in the matter it's 

204.01 205.18 B: right 

204.60 214.33 A: it's the owners and the players that go on strike but neither one of those is really losing enough money that it's going to make a difference in their lives you know [noise] and uh 

212.13 213.52 B: exactly 

214.40 214.96 A: (( [cough] )) 

215.11 221.53 A: you know like i said personally i think it's ridiculous and then that was they called the uh the one year i think it was ninety four 

221.44 225.24 A: there was uh no baseball season then the baseball season ended 

224.70 225.59 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

225.05 236.52 A: and i believe that when during that season the expos who are montreal actually were in first place and you know the montreal fans never really got anything to cheer for in baseballwise and uh 

236.50 250.55 A: you know that year they were in first place and their teams decided they weren't making enough money and they you know went on strike and a team like that that [sigh] has never have never won a world series ends up getting screwed because of the fact that uh you know 

240.88 241.89 B: right 

250.52 255.81 A: the owners and players couldn't come to- together you know couldn't come to an agreement [noise] mhm [lipsmack] 

254.76 255.83 B: right 

255.85 265.47 B: [mn] well i agree with you wholeheartedly about um the foreigners and how they come and i never really wanted to like say that but i kind of always thought it 

265.72 266.86 B: you know 

265.85 272.72 A: yeah they i know uh if if you look at uh if you look at the players that just that george steinbrenner has signed uh for the yankees 

266.94 267.96 B: [laughter] 

272.26 273.32 B: mhm 

272.60 285.41 A: over the last few years he signed uh cuban defectors you know people that he he basically goes in and goes around the world and just plucks the uh the cream of the crop from different leagues like the the the leagues in in japan 

281.89 282.71 B: (( mm )) 

284.97 285.99 B: mhm 

285.31 299.57 A: and uh what they'll do is just [sigh] he no one else can offer them the money that he can so he just he basically buys out the league he's actually a problem i think that he's that that team in particular is different from the rest of the owners in in that 

290.57 291.66 B: right 

299.48 303.93 A: you know the other owners can't really aff- afford to do things like that but he can 

302.78 303.70 B: mhm 

303.87 304.86 B: mhm 

303.95 310.88 A: and there's not really there's no salary cap in baseball so he can just continue to outbid every other team pretty much and 

309.89 314.23 B: well who was who was that that plays basketball um [lipsmack] 

314.33 318.64 B: he can't even speak english is that yeah 

316.23 317.37 A: (( yao ming )) 

318.25 330.12 A: yeah he's yeah basketball's a little bit different because you have um [lipsmack] i guess they have salary you know they [sigh] i don't know if there's a salary cap in basketball but it's not like baseball where they can just 

327.69 328.59 B: (( okay okay )) 

330.22 339.44 A: pay anyone they want as much as they want to to play wherever you know that's that's why the the yankees have a uh starting rotation for their pitchers who are all probably going to be hall of famers 

339.41 351.71 A: um [lipsmack] but i mean i mean i i if if i if i had the talent you know to play professional sports then i guess i'd might be a different different view but from my point of view though you know 

348.74 349.70 B: mhm 

352.25 361.44 A: [lipsmack] they they all make enough money and no matter what their problems are between the the players and the management and the owners it's something that they should be able to uh 

361.54 369.85 A: be able to settle without having to go to strike and without having to uh cause the people the fans people that put their money in the pockets you know 

370.39 374.82 A: cause to or cause them to to miss out on things like that i mean it's 

374.81 384.52 A: what they do for a living is play games and that stuff you know people the people that pay their salaries go to work all day and then come home and watch those games you know the the players 

377.03 377.94 B: (( exactly )) 

382.92 384.05 B: right 

384.35 392.39 A: you know their work is they get up at and they have to be at the field at two o'clock in the afternoon take some batting practice or shoot a round and things like that 

389.61 390.71 B: mhm 

391.73 392.93 B: right 

392.75 393.87 A: and uh 

394.29 403.81 A: you know i- it's it's not i'd kill to have a job like that you know i i'd i'd play any professional sport for the salary that i make now you know 

403.00 410.91 B: [noise] and then if if it's something that you love to do you know why why did they have to commercialize it so 

405.91 407.04 A: mhm 

410.50 422.20 A: right i think they actually maybe should put a sal- a a cap on now on endorsements and how much but then again that's the american way it is that kind of is will never happen i tell you that will never happen just because of the fact that it's 

411.52 412.44 B: (( mhm mm )) 

422.23 432.35 A: unconstitutional to say that a person can only make so much money you know but at the same time though uh they shouldn't be able to i mean 

426.45 428.30 B: mhm right right 

432.34 442.01 A: i guess you know unions go on strike and things like that but these these people that go on strike with unions are uh you know what's when they're on strike they're not getting paid and and they're 

441.85 449.00 A: they're on welfare and they're they're uh you know they're struggling just to survive whereas if a baseball team or a football team goes on strike 

443.27 444.55 B: mhm 

449.19 458.36 A: it it's just they they can't drive a mercedes they have to drive you know they have to drive their their last year's mercedes instead of uh you know this year's porsche or something like that 

451.66 453.39 B: right [laughter] 

457.42 460.44 B: or let the gardener go or something [laughter] 

459.43 462.82 A: yeah so i think it's ridiculous but uh 

462.89 465.58 A: so have you been to the new stadium in cincinnati yet 

465.29 467.29 B: yeah and it's beautiful 

466.58 480.97 A: yeah we got two new stadiums coming up this year and i'm really i know there's a i think there's a bargaining agreement actually that uh baseball's up for there's a new um [lipsmack] a new contract i think that they're supposed to be coming up with i think this summer and there's always a chance 

481.06 489.15 A: they could go on strike again and i'll be really pissed if it delays the opening of the stadium at all [sigh] it's supposed to open about next year 

488.80 490.03 B: mm mm okay 

489.76 491.02 A: yeah so 

491.27 495.18 A: you go to uh you going to the bengals games this year you think they're going to be any better 

494.62 499.23 B: uh i doubt it [laughter] i really do they suck 

496.22 496.98 A: huh 

497.04 497.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

497.92 500.68 A: yeah yeah they uh they 

500.28 501.35 B: (( mhm )) 

500.60 510.82 A: i'll tell you what uh that that owner is a guy that just should get out that's actually he's the opposite [noise] the exact opposite of an owner like george steinbrenner where he doesn't pay anyone any money 

510.32 511.31 B: mhm 

510.67 517.01 A: and uh does does the city out there do they just hate who is it paul brown is the owner of s- the the bengals 

515.41 517.36 B: yeah paul brown 

516.89 528.15 A: do they just you know ha- just are they des- despised by him just because of the fact that cincinnati's never does anything and never signs anyone never has any hope they just can't stand it 

525.70 526.95 B: [laughter] 

527.02 537.52 B: i i don't know i i know that there was a lot of controversy regarding them getting the stadium because they suck and they've always sucked [laughter] 

534.94 535.90 A: yeah 

535.91 542.93 A: and that's another thing yeah i mean that that money you know who paid for that i'm sure tax payers had to pay something for that and and 

541.27 543.57 B: oh yeah exactly yeah we did 

542.98 553.22 A: and i think you know when more taxes when tax payers are putting money out of their pockets to build these stadiums they should have a say in when you know a player or a team or a league can go on strike [noise] [lipsmack] 

552.36 554.07 B: mhm mhm 

554.02 555.11 A: and uh 

554.16 556.26 B: but they're not going to let us do that 

555.69 563.57 A: yeah well if you're in cincinnati though uh you know i wouldn't mind if a team went on strike just because of the fact that it's the bengals but you know that's just personal 

556.51 557.83 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

564.23 565.69 B: (( poor bengals )) 

564.39 568.18 A: so yeah they get the number one pick again i think this year 

569.35 572.00 B: um i don't think i've heard anything about that 

571.03 578.32 A: they're now away did they they're there already very are they they already took the number one pick they signed carson palmer that's right out of u._s._c. the quarterback 

577.80 578.95 B: okay 

578.50 581.61 A: but uh at least they they paid the money for him they had him 

581.75 584.36 A: they paid a lot of money for him actually [sigh] 

583.66 591.34 B: are we going to get to keep our coach is what i'm wondering we we change coach coaches like underwear around here [laughter] 

588.55 591.28 A: yeah who's your coach who's the coach out there now 

591.65 598.24 B: i mean they're they're always there's always something going on and when we had marge schott that was crazy 

597.84 599.95 A: (( huh i hear she's another one you know )) 

598.74 599.89 B: [laughter]
