0.00 1.15 B: hi 

1.24 3.58 A: hi this is irwin binder 

3.35 6.23 B: oh hi this is sylvia i'm calling from new york 

6.11 9.21 A: and i'm near outside washington d._c. 

8.81 9.82 B: oh wow 

9.47 12.56 A: well let let me just ask are you are you a sports fan 

12.31 14.02 B: no not at all 

13.66 19.71 A: uh well you have some camaraderie here and i wonder how that's going to color our discussion on this 

19.19 26.57 B: [laughter] um well the topic is the recent strikes i i [noise] i wasn't aware that [noise] there was a recent strike 

26.94 28.04 B: um 

27.69 29.39 A: i'm not either [laughter] 

28.61 34.37 B: yeah i don't even know in what sports but i guess just speaking generally um 

35.32 38.91 B: i don't know i don't even i i guess i never really thought about this topic 

39.44 48.23 A: well it doesn't have a great deal of impact on me i will say i think that uh the many of the athletes are paid very high salaries 

48.15 54.61 A: and um and yet if they can negotiate it's hard for me to say no you're not allowed to do this 

54.39 65.18 B: right [noise] and and uh there's plenty of uh industries where people could strike or that there's you know so i don't see why sports wouldn't be part of that 

65.52 78.51 A: that's right um uh it's not something where the the stance of the country's at stake where the health and welfare is at stake or perhaps there it's justified to have some requirement to prevent strikes 

78.30 80.87 B: right right um 

80.39 84.78 A: but do i do do realize that i think when when these athletes um 

84.89 93.78 A: strike then they're they're also threatening their own future i i guess all workers do but these athletes don't have many places they can jump to as an alternative 

93.48 94.60 B: that's true 

94.64 104.73 A: uh and and if they're destroying the reputation of the sport if they're driving away fans reducing the enthusiasm of fans 

104.69 110.21 A: then it's going to really hurt them also in the future it's kind of a game of chicken i think they're playing 

111.30 112.66 B: oh um 

112.75 113.51 B: the 

113.52 114.95 B: hello are you still there 

114.47 115.94 A: i'm still here 

115.27 127.02 B: [laughter] you come in and out um the other thing i could think about is that it's it's almost unfair for them to strike because they're not as easily replaced 

128.57 136.25 A: well then are you advocating involuntary servitude 'cause that's what it could lead to if they can't strike 

136.77 146.83 B: right well it's not so much involuntary solitu- uh well the thing is they all have i assume they all have individual contracts that some players are paid better than others 

146.19 147.97 A: oh yeah definitely 

147.39 156.24 B: um but for them to strike it's almost like they're saying they're going to work as a group when that kind of goes against the individuality of it 

156.03 161.47 A: well but there's a i think a parallel to let's say stockholders in a corporation 

161.37 174.33 A: you can't have individual stockholders making decisions they have a common interest and they have to make some group decision and this is what the company's going to do in a similar way the employees are a group 

174.21 181.99 A: that share a common interest uh it it makes much a lot of sense for them to do things in a coordinated way 

181.76 182.66 B: right 

182.21 184.91 A: uh uh for for the general benefit 

184.48 187.44 B: i'm just trying to think of other 

187.47 194.32 B: because i when i think of strikes i think of um like teachers or bus drivers or things like that and those 

194.34 196.12 B: those people they 

196.15 209.78 B: they generally don't possess a special talent that nobody else has that they're going to get paid a lot for i mean they generally come in at a at a set entry level salary and then they just work their way up regardless of who they are i guess in particular 

209.71 216.79 B: whereas with the sports one person that might have like a great pitching arm or something might get paid a lot more than like some other person 

217.47 219.63 B: and for them to strike is just kind of 

217.48 218.37 A: well 

219.68 221.77 B: doesn't go along those same lines 

221.68 226.40 A: [cough] i think also when you look at most uh labor situations 

226.35 240.15 A: there are small differences in many cases that they're striking over i mean it may be at ten or twenty percent i'm not so sure that it's salary that they that the athletes are striking over i think often it's um 

240.07 252.68 A: the uh rules under which they can negotiate under which they can be paid and um those standards uh uh may have a lot more impact on on their working conditions 

252.68 256.06 A: than would be typical for for other employees 

255.99 269.59 B: right that might be true and it's funny that um what you just said 'cause it made me think that athletes also just by their their sheer nature they can make money in other ways in addition to what they do on the field 

269.13 270.35 A: only a few 

270.47 271.66 B: yeah well 

270.78 273.58 A: not so many can do that 

272.47 273.97 B: mm that's true 

273.82 276.70 A: yeah not so many can can live off of their name 

276.53 290.62 A: but i i think when i was talking about the big impact of what they're negotiating over i think a parallel would be if uh it were proposed to take tenure away from teachers but that would have major impact on on their employment 

290.02 291.03 B: (( right right )) 

290.42 303.06 A: and so something like that that would be a major fight that that would occur there big issue i mean it's not like you know an additional dollar an hour or whatever a change to health benefits 

303.74 304.63 B: right 

305.47 313.16 B: yeah i i i feel badly that i don't haven't been following it i don't know what they're striking for or what they might have a problem with mm 

313.47 315.19 A: well you know it really 

315.08 327.37 A: there are i think lingering after effects more in the sports than in most other industries uh i think that there is a loss of enthusiasm among the fans 

327.24 335.45 A: and that has a lot to do with the attendance that the owners are depending on or the viewership so for their t._v. contracts 

336.70 346.52 B: i i think they're actually not i'm thinking hard about this i think last year's world series or maybe some other play off or really important game one of the teams threatened to strike 

347.17 351.95 A: i think that there was delay in the world series because of the baseball players strike recently 

351.22 357.32 B: right right and then ticket holders didn't even know whether to show up that night for the game or not um 

357.53 369.08 A: but my feeling is still so what it's i think uh a difference between that and say uh how are you going to get to work i don't know if you're in new york city but uh you know 

368.85 375.06 A: new york city the if there's a transit strike you know massive impact there on the community 

368.98 369.89 B: i am 

374.92 379.70 B: yeah yeah we did i mean we did have um the the potential strike 

379.39 380.31 A: right 

379.75 384.64 B: a couple of months back um and there were i guess other 

384.69 386.84 B: contingency plans in place 

386.90 389.38 B: uh and you know they ended up not striking 

389.18 390.29 A: right 

389.63 391.44 B: but yeah 

390.49 397.72 A: right yeah uh a- and w- so weigh that against um well we're not having the world series 

398.12 407.37 A: now a lot of that is played up at the world series part it's played up uh in the the the media which certainly in some way serves the industry 

403.22 404.16 B: mhm 

408.38 409.36 B: right 

408.79 421.38 A: really promotes the industry i don't think you i don't think we really have the same weight or importance as a doctors' strike or a teachers' strike things like that really we're more dependent on 

419.99 420.68 B: (( [cough] )) 

421.60 424.60 B: well we did have a potential doctors strike in new york 

424.52 425.90 A: over insurance 

425.97 427.09 B: um 

428.31 433.93 B: is it um i think it was i think it was i know it was the doctors that work in um in hospitals 

433.55 436.64 A: were they the residents and the number of hours they work 

436.25 438.19 B: uh i don't remember the exact 

437.25 438.38 A: okay 

438.40 439.43 B: um 

439.65 441.01 B: like what they were 

441.11 444.64 B: striking about but i remember there was a potential strike with the doctors 

444.43 453.83 A: yeah and and to me that's much more significant than uh to me personally my feelings than if they're out playing sports i don't read the sports section anyway 

453.45 454.35 B: right 

454.46 459.62 A: well think what industry has its own section of the newspaper 

460.41 461.99 A: business maybe 

461.77 464.10 B: right well do you think that 

464.19 467.00 B: um an athlete is more likely 

467.41 472.81 B: like to get what they want by striking than like your your nurse or your bus driver mm 

473.66 483.22 A: it depends on the athlete if it's a big enough name uh it maybe critical to the fame and reputation of the team 

484.47 489.99 A: uh what what happens if if the owner were to say no i think the owner comes out looking bad 

488.72 500.01 B: right 'cause i was because i was just thinking about the recent possible strikes like especially with the transit one that was a couple of months back um what they ended up agreeing on they they didn't really get very much 

501.91 502.73 A: mm 

501.99 505.06 B: and i was thinking like all this you know 

505.15 509.75 B: worrying and and possible striking and negotiations for a couple of dollars 

510.74 515.16 A: well a couple of dollars is what percent of their salary is number one 

515.22 524.06 A: number two there's also a sense that they demonstrate they do have power and those bosses better not push us around again they'll remember this 

523.72 524.55 B: right 

523.97 531.23 A: there's that so the strength of the union i think it was vital for them for the union to show some gain even if it was small 

531.05 531.96 B: right 

532.65 533.45 B: (( right mm )) 

534.92 539.33 A: yeah no i i don't have a lot of sympathy for for athletes though 

538.61 545.68 B: oh yeah i i don't i don't i don't have any i mean they get they get paid a lot of money to do something that they enjoy 

540.35 542.03 A: (( professional athletes especially )) 

545.35 553.07 A: what what about the uh the limited number of years that they have available to 'em it's not a um long term career 

553.44 557.92 A: and and the fact that most of the athletes do not make it professionally 

558.19 568.76 A: they never make it in the pros or to the top leagues and uh a lot most of them like may you know it's very similar to to the uh actors 

569.22 570.11 B: right 

570.19 574.48 A: there too very few make it those that do command big bucks 

575.46 576.27 B: right 

576.92 581.42 A: now the actors since they really act individually 

581.44 584.14 A: very seldom can they go out on strike 

583.92 586.14 B: there was a writers' strike wasn't there 

585.75 588.60 A: yes there have there was the writers' strike yes 

587.90 589.83 B: that was recently i think 

589.41 591.00 A: (( uh i don't )) 

590.14 594.88 B: and i think some of the actors um went on strike also like in support of the writers mm 

594.39 599.89 A: they did respect the picket lines that's correct yes but i think the individual ac
