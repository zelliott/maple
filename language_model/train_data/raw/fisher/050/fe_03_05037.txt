147.29 148.65 A: (( it seems scary )) 

153.74 162.31 A: [noise] well no i wasn't at all i mean like it's too bad like in that way it is kinda 'cause i have some friends that are actually from a different country 

162.42 163.27 B: uh-huh 

162.71 166.92 A: like they live here and [noise] they were going to school and i kinda 

166.93 178.90 A: got to know 'em really well but just because of the september eleventh this whole immigration thing just changed completely you know they getting really tight about all the laws and who's 

174.92 175.48 B: (( [cough] )) 

178.88 191.00 A: doing what and that they cracking down all the students from different countries and making sure they're going in their school and what not so i've actually a couple of friends just because from their what i think one of them are from like uh 

190.94 191.50 B: (( [cough] )) 

191.47 205.85 A: iran or something but he was just like really good kid and then was like doing his master's degree and all of a sudden i got a call from him like after a few months later after september eleventh and then he's actually they put him in a detention it 

192.97 193.83 B: right 

207.02 208.02 A: (( was just )) 

207.21 209.20 B: they put him in a detention [cough] [noise] 

208.55 223.49 A: yeah like they just seemed like they started like questioning they put him in a detention said he'd called for [mn] help to help him bail him out and so they've found out you know that he was a good kid it was just they were doing the stupid things just you know with the one big 

223.45 233.15 A: it was kind of like [mn] you know i just thought it was really unnecessary how they dealt with it and w- it wasn't w- really unnecessary i thought it was necessary but i'm just 

233.15 240.47 A: the the way they deal with the whole thing is just like you know they just kind of jump over and say oh he's from iran so we have to get that kid 

240.57 248.18 A: and instead of just looking at who they are and [noise] it was kind of bunch of overgeneralization going on i guess [laughter] 

240.73 241.51 B: yeah 

248.34 250.88 B: wh- what did you say you say you're bengali [mn] 

250.92 251.95 A: huh 

251.61 253.32 B: you said you were bengali 

253.08 256.32 A: no i'm actually half japanese and half mongolian 

256.53 261.88 B: oh mongolian oh okay okay okay so you're not what i'm assuming you're like buddhist or 

257.99 258.84 A: yeah 

261.74 263.93 A: yeah i'm a buddhist 

263.25 266.05 B: okay so you i mean you weren't even affected at all [mn] 

266.13 267.28 B: (( see i thought it was )) 

266.28 272.06 A: (( no i wasn't at all but i don't know just i'm a kind of bystander i was kind of bystander )) 

272.18 282.32 A: so it's it's just affects you though but it's not like necessarily what you know it affected i think it affected everyone in a way in each different world 

272.41 273.25 B: okay 

281.22 287.68 B: really i mean it affected like me 'cause you know i i obviously like you know you felt bad for all the people that died 

287.66 289.23 A: yeah 

288.70 298.14 B: an- and just like i mean i'm not going to lie the day that it happened i was um coming back from class [mn] and there's like there were like t._v.s all on in the dorm 

298.18 303.00 B: and gee everybody's crowded around the t._v.s and i'm like what the hell's going on 

301.95 312.02 A: yeah and then and then like after this whole thing is you know but another thing that kind of pissed me off was about after september eleven how people reacted 

312.30 324.35 A: and just people were like talking about putting the flags out and you know it's all right putting your flags out i don't know and letting you know you know you just write everywhere united we stand but m- 

324.21 329.24 A: (( see this was the only thing that i didn't really do that kind of pissed me off was because people weren't you know )) 

329.22 337.54 A: all they were doing was like putting out flags out and writing a sign all over the wall and then say saying you know 

337.40 341.61 A: united we stand god bless america you know it's not too bad but [mn] 

341.56 356.27 A: they weren't doing anything to help the economy and like to help the other people that affected like really seriously they were what they were doing was just like you know kind of going with the flow and just putting a flag out and [mn] getting a bumper sticker 

354.75 359.57 B: (( but be there like kind of bull you know they just trying bullshit and make themselves like its ))
