0.40 2.60 B: hi this is idel penning 

2.10 4.05 A: hi this is tom how are you 

3.85 4.89 B: hi tom 

5.53 7.91 B: so we got airport security huh 

7.45 9.57 A: that's what the topic is today 

8.97 10.45 B: (( oh okay )) 

9.85 12.66 A: well you why don't you start and then i'll retort 

12.26 25.70 B: okay all righty um well seeing how i've uh just done a little bit of traveling i got to experience [laughter] a little bit of that um i find it interesting that uh some airports are a little more strict than others 

26.16 30.72 B: and uh i do- really don't think it's going to deter the terrorists any so 

30.31 31.58 A: wow 

31.12 32.54 B: you know that's 

32.93 38.60 B: and i live in the mid west so you know that's just airports here in the mid west now 

38.27 45.20 A: okay i i live in washington d._c. so so i could tell you that security in these airports has been heightened dramatically 

40.60 41.48 B: uh-huh 

44.65 45.92 B: i bet 

45.25 50.45 A: um y- you know and uh i don't have a problem with it personally i think the more the better but um 

50.34 57.21 A: it it it it definitely takes a while to get to board a plane there there's a lot more a lot more i._d.s being checked 

53.66 55.31 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

56.90 57.76 B: uh-huh 

57.00 65.68 A: um you know there's a a more intent um um you notice the person watching your luggage go through the the carousel is a little more intent than they used to be they're like 

64.67 66.85 B: ye- well yeah 

66.24 69.70 A: they they seem to be looking a little more aggressively 

69.09 70.67 B: yeah yeah 

69.65 81.52 A: um i think in areas certainly in the d._c. area it has to be a de- a deterrent to terrorist activity i mean absolutely because they're uh they're making it very difficult for you to get in and out and unfortunately um they you know there's a lot of racial profiling going on 

73.56 74.61 B: oh yeah 

77.60 78.44 B: yeah 

81.16 82.17 B: yeah 

81.50 88.94 A: and um the some people are going to be subjected to more thorough searches than others um though again i i don't necessarily have a problem with that because 

85.34 86.35 B: right 

89.04 90.96 A: you know i feel as if um 

90.78 99.43 A: you know anybody that gets into an airpl- that makes a contract to board an airport airplane at an airport should be scrutinized and should be subjected to i mean it didn't so it doesn't take much to 

99.25 103.58 A: to overthrow an airplane as you see they did it with you know box cutters during nine one one 

101.34 102.27 B: right 

103.38 112.89 A: so i i think any you know any and all precautions are fine with me i don't have a problem with it and and i wish they did it in the mid west of course the threat maybe isn't as large to you out there 

103.43 104.34 B: yeah 

112.67 122.74 A: uh you know being as we're right here i'm like two miles from d._c. so you know this is a high and i'm and it is and in new york city i've been told as well um you know because we're such targets but 

114.20 115.11 B: mhm 

115.74 116.65 B: uh-huh 

117.38 118.53 B: oh yeah 

120.04 120.99 B: oh yeah 

122.11 132.23 B: and atlanta is too 'cause i i was at a conference for work and um they we were talking about all of us were coming from different parts of the country and we were all talking about different areas 

126.02 126.93 A: right 

132.25 143.27 B: and um i could tell you that the airport here is an international airport and they do scrutinize everybody um i didn't realize that i had a little um 

139.32 140.24 A: (( right [noise] )) 

143.70 145.98 B: oh what was it it was a little swiss army knife 

146.05 148.83 B: and i didn't realize it was in my carry on 

148.54 149.87 A: (( uh )) 

148.94 152.04 B: and they wouldn't let me go through until they thoroughly went 

152.08 159.51 B: through my bag and it took them three attempts before they finally found it which is why i didn't know i had it 

159.00 160.23 A: wow 

159.61 171.09 B: and my only regret is i feel that you know they took my name and all that fun stuff but um i would have liked to have the opportunity to have that mailed back to me because it has 

171.14 174.11 B: um my initials on it it was a gift 

173.50 181.57 A: oh yeah well absolutely but i i got to i gotta kinda take their side in one way you really should have thought about that [laughter] 

180.66 183.18 B: oh well i didn't even know i had it in there 

182.59 184.38 A: right right yeah but i don't 

183.40 185.31 B: you know they were just yeah 

184.69 193.77 A: that's very unfortunate that that's the kind of stuff that that you hear about you know happening 'cause the i mean by accident people do leave stuff in there and uh that's kind of scary in a way 

191.08 192.02 B: uh-huh 

193.52 198.44 B: oh yeah but i was it was nice though to know the you know they weren't going to let me go on 

194.14 194.98 A: (( you know right )) 

198.15 199.04 A: (( or my luggage )) 

200.32 201.18 A: (( wasn't going anywhere )) 

200.35 202.57 B: until they found out why it kept beeping 

202.01 204.63 A: right well that's pretty good then i mean that's got 

203.38 209.78 B: yeah and that that is good now i will say when i was travelling in the wisconsin area i had the same luggage 

210.14 212.08 B: and um 

212.14 214.61 B: it they it didn't do anything 

214.09 215.94 A: oh you boarded with it 

215.36 216.84 B: and i boarded with it 

216.14 218.71 A: well now that's not too encouraging is it [noise] 

217.98 224.50 B: no it's not 'cause then they were all saying you know we don't want to go to wisconsin [laughter] you know yeah [noise] 

222.18 232.00 A: yeah well that's an that's amazing that would almost warrant a letter or something i mean that's that's amazing that you were able to board i mean that's that's all it would take to to overthrow a plane 

231.84 233.21 B: right right 

232.13 234.73 A: you know it it's that simple that's amazing 

233.65 235.89 B: it's just a simple yeah and 

234.88 239.06 A: so that's got to be highly uh discouraging that's highly discouraging for me to hear [laughter] 

238.56 242.88 B: well you know and that's why i said my opening comment was i don't think so 

242.43 246.50 A: yeah obviously obviously not in certain areas that's for sure 

242.94 243.93 B: (( you know )) 

245.50 249.08 B: yeah you know and yeah maybe they may not feel that way but 

249.29 250.88 B: you know i 

249.84 250.81 A: yeah you 

250.72 265.68 B: i don't know what happens to your luggage once it gets transported you know i don't know if they say okay it's made it through so then it's okay or if they scan it again i don't know because obviously they didn't scan me again i just went from one plane and hopped on to my next 

253.98 254.92 A: right 

265.68 268.08 B: connection and you know kept going 

267.91 268.85 A: (( mm )) 

268.62 269.56 B: so 

269.47 271.01 A: oh that's amazing 

270.37 273.96 B: yeah so i'm just kind of like i am [laughter] 

273.04 274.57 A: [laughter] 

273.91 279.30 B: i don't know my son went you when he he went to arizona and he had to fly 

279.24 285.26 B: from um the michigan area to um through detroit through 

285.16 287.22 B: kentucky and then over 

287.11 300.23 B: and then on his way back he flew to atlanta and to detroit and back and we called them 'cause he wanted to take his skateboard with him and and we called and said could he do that [laughter] you know we don't want make any any alarms go off or anything and 

298.44 299.56 A: right 

300.09 312.03 B: and they told us what we had to do in order for him to take it and and stuff but he was real careful i said you know don't wear any belts don't do this don't do that and and he was he went through he had no problems or anything 

307.44 308.49 A: right 

311.61 313.10 A: well that's good 

312.29 323.81 B: and so that you know and i told him i said you're going to see people that are going to have to kick their shoes off they're going to have to take this off they're going to you know i said you can tell who the experienced fliers are because [laughter] they are so 

324.08 330.97 B: least stressed [laughter] so you know so we we you know you learn you do learn 

325.21 327.47 A: right right [laughter] 

330.37 334.38 A: yeah that's amazing that's a l- lesson that i've learned that's amazing 

334.01 335.13 B: yeah 

334.56 340.20 A: but uh i guess then then then then in some regards i maybe it does deter but then obviously in others it doesn't 

339.90 344.46 B: yeah i they you know and i think they would have such a connection that they would be able to tell 

344.43 345.37 A: yeah 

344.47 351.38 B: how to get weave in and out they would be able to say you know what this one here is is a little lax 

350.74 352.49 A: yeah absolutely i mean 

351.67 356.02 B: so and who would you write to though i don't even know who i would write to to the airport 

354.59 357.79 A: i would probably i would probably write to the airport security 

357.88 360.63 A: directly there's got to be a direct um 

359.91 362.85 B: a direct yeah they've they've got to have somebody yeah 

361.88 365.12 A: yeah i really i really think i would i mean that's something that 

364.96 377.52 A: you know that i would i would kind of be concerned about i mean it you know just like you said if you were a potential terrorist and you were on a trip with a with a knife in your bag you know and then you found out that a had at airport a they they they took it from you 

377.29 378.15 B: uh-huh 

377.32 390.64 A: they wouldn't let you board but at airport b. you boarded with it no problem well then he might consider you know taking over a plane at airport b. [laughter] i mean that's that's um that's if you that's almost a little test that you've done yeah i definitely think that it would warrant a letter to somebody and 

383.45 384.52 B: yeah 

387.63 388.44 B: (( you did )) 

389.76 396.81 B: that's true because all they want to do uh you know if they wanted to fly it in to the pentagon again they'd just say well we're going from wisconsin this time you know 

395.62 400.98 A: yeah i mean absolutely that i i highly i highly encourage you to write a letter to them and tell them 

397.54 398.36 B: yeah 

399.75 411.14 B: yeah i didn't even think about that i was just like well i never said anything about it because at the time i didn't know i had it with me and it wasn't until i went through my my local [laughter] airport and it was like you have something in here 

404.46 406.69 A: right right 

410.90 411.89 A: (( right )) 

411.18 414.50 B: (( i do [laughter] you know i'm like okay )) 

412.47 413.36 A: huh 

414.10 421.62 A: wow that's amazing yeah you y- yeah you have you're a great person for this conversation then 'cause you've got first hand experience is it working or not working 

414.61 416.93 B: well as they taking out all my stuff 

421.30 427.18 B: yeah and i didn't even think about it i mean it was always an eye opener for me because i wasn't even thinking i was thinking 

423.10 424.09 A: (( i know )) 

425.09 426.19 A: yeah true 

426.99 428.06 B: i was thinking 

427.87 442.38 B: darn it i lost that that knife and i really like it i didn't like the comment when she found it and she said ooh this is really nice and i'm like so it's just too bad you're not getting it back and i was like what [laughter] what do you mean i'm not getting it back 'cause i thought they would say 

430.74 431.64 A: right 

437.56 439.19 A: (( oh no )) 

442.15 445.40 B: you know here's an envelope you wha- you know if i could pay for the 

445.01 446.07 A: yeah 

445.43 454.55 B: mailing back i would like it back and they said i was talking to a neighbor who works for the airport and he says now what they do is they have a big auction and 

447.26 448.31 A: right 

454.76 461.40 B: i said well i don't like that either [laughter] unless i can say that is mine it has my initials on it [laughter] 

456.08 458.43 A: [laughter] yeah 

460.53 470.97 A: right that's that's too bad well yeah i guess well well that was your main concern you didn't get you didn't even think about how you had had skated through the other airports with it yeah that's a true little test you've done 

462.82 463.73 B: (( you know )) 

470.43 475.42 B: yeah yeah i didn't even think about it i will have to do that i'll just sit down and and write it out 

471.67 472.23 A: (( [cough] )) 

473.50 474.06 A: (( [cough] )) 

474.12 482.48 A: yeah i highly encourage you to do that 'cause i'm i i now would think twice about flying in or out of wisconsin you can bet on that huh 

478.72 491.63 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah i imagine you will you'll say do i have no i'm not going through that one [laughter] it was the milk- the milwaukee one so i don't know [laughter] i don't know where the airports are there but not so big it has a pretty 

484.47 486.25 A: that's for sure 

491.65 500.59 B: good size airport it's not a little dinky one you know so and i don't think of grand rapids as being a real big one but they were very thorough they were the ones that found it 

492.66 493.65 A: right 

494.11 495.42 A: (( right so )) 

495.45 496.25 A: what 

499.30 502.43 A: yeah any any airport though i don't care if it's if it's 

501.83 502.99 B: oh no 

502.43 517.17 A: you know if it's carting two passengers through a day any airport has an obligation to to not allow that to happen i mean that's just that's ridiculous because it was a simple box cutter you know that took a that that that they took over the planes with during during the thing and and a swiss army knife is is every bit of a box cutter 

504.63 505.63 B: yeah 

507.09 508.70 B: yeah yeah 

513.14 514.08 B: right 

516.63 518.27 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

517.19 519.63 A: and uh i mean the fact that 

518.74 523.27 B: oh yeah even e- 'cause they would take a corkscrew from you you know 

521.56 525.93 A: right right yep everything nail files everything 

523.75 524.94 B: so any 

525.01 527.06 B: yeah nothing nothing so 

526.68 528.66 A: so that's truly amazing 

528.34 534.23 B: it's yeah well gee this is an interesting conversation like you said because i will have to sit down and and write to them 

532.05 532.82 A: oh 

533.07 539.70 A: oh y- yeah i highly encourage you to do that 'cause i think they need to be made aware of of the fact that they're they're lax in security i mean 'cause a uh 

539.52 549.46 A: a plane coming out of wisconsin could be destined for anywhere you know what i mean so that that certainly would be my concern i mean they could come here [laughter] and i'd hate for there to be lax you know for there to be lax uh 

542.38 543.33 B: mhm 

544.34 545.35 B: oh yeah 

546.26 548.08 B: oh well yeah 

549.27 555.92 A: uh airport security in wisconsin that could potentially lead to disaster here in d._c. area you know i mean 'cause they could they they could come 

553.49 554.38 B: right 

554.95 556.49 B: it's not that far 

556.04 560.02 A: right i mean they could come in no time that's definitely yeah right back into the pentagon 

559.75 560.73 B: mhm 

560.47 563.11 A: so uh yeah you're absolutely r- absolutely 

563.18 565.44 A: you've a duty to write a letter i believe 

564.87 567.74 B: oh yeah i think so i think you're right there yeah 

565.78 566.73 A: yeah 

567.02 573.88 A: yeah i i certainly would i would certainly just take the time and just just jot a line just to make them aware and you know i'm sure 

571.90 572.86 B: yeah 

573.04 577.83 B: well i guess that i wasn't even thinking i was just thinking how am i going to get that stupid thing back [laughter] [laughter] 

575.85 581.03 A: [laughter] i know i would also write to the other airport and tell them how how upset you were that they kept your knife 

581.11 582.47 A: [laughter] 

582.27 587.21 B: you know this one let it go and they shouldn't have and you kept it and i want it back [laughter] 

585.91 588.56 A: right fair's fair 

587.93 592.12 B: well i guess in some airports they do do that they do let you um 

592.23 595.39 B: you know if they don't think you're suspicious or anything they'll let you um 

594.75 596.18 A: (( oh right )) 

595.70 596.55 B: you know 

596.91 599.89 B: pay for the mailing and and get it back and then others don't 

598.79 599.89 A: yeah that would seem to me
