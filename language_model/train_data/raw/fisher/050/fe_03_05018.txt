25.79 33.89 A: uh one thing i can tell you is i am involved somewhat in the security area somewhat related to that so maybe um 

34.43 42.06 A: [lipsmack] it a- i'm more conscious of a lot of the security stuff than i think most people are i don't know what your background is 

41.41 43.49 B: my background's education 

43.30 44.67 A: uh teaching 

43.70 46.40 B: so uh i'm actually a principal 

46.13 49.81 A: oh all right all right so you got some of the uh responsibilities 

49.21 53.76 B: right at keeping the place safe and keeping people out uh 

54.21 63.14 B: september eleventh in our building we had uh our superintendent which is our boss he came to us and told us to turn all the t._v.s on 

63.44 66.44 B: that is was considered he considered it a teachable moment 

67.00 68.16 B: uh 

67.96 73.29 A: [noise] [noise] i think that would be really difficult to do because one was not prepared for that 

72.69 83.67 B: right i th- i thought it was okay until the part where you know the buildings started to collapse i said m- i- it's no lo- now the kids now the kids have lost it um 

73.81 74.72 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

83.61 91.67 B: now they're worried now they're thinking about people dying and and uh yeah that was that was uh an incredible day 

92.43 96.87 A: yeah i i i saw it happen i saw the building come down 

97.23 98.86 A: o- o- on t._v. 

97.26 98.09 B: see i 

98.75 101.82 B: right i was on the phone actually with my wife 

102.08 115.48 B: [mn] maybe an hour later 'cause it was just mass chaos and she said something about when the buildings were there i'm like what do you mean when she goes well they collapsed i go what do you mean they collapsed and then i ran to the t._v. 

115.42 118.38 B: and i'm just like oh my god 

119.02 131.50 A: well i happened to be in the hospital at the time and uh we were watching um uh 'cause we heard on the radio that a plane had hit and it's okay let's you know put on t._v. this is going to be interesting 

127.62 128.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

131.52 137.08 A: and then watched the whole thing develop and realised it was not just an accident of a little plane running into the building 

136.08 138.04 B: right right [noise] 

137.23 147.19 A: a- and um and then watching it and suddenly th- there's smoke on on the t._v. view on the t._v. screen and i'm wondering w- why aren't they showing us the building any more uh 

146.52 148.64 B: yeah yeah 

147.23 158.86 A: you know what what happened you know uh why'd they turn away and only after a little bit i- th- the uh announcer got the regained composure and was able to describe what had happened 

157.87 161.22 B: [noise] i think some of the newscasts were showing people jumping a- 

161.10 162.89 A: i didn't see that 

162.21 168.75 B: oh that was it was it was and then i saw recaps of it [noise] and that was that was horrible 

166.52 167.76 A: yeah 

168.80 178.43 A: yeah okay well what about what about the impact of it on our lives and security now i d- do you feel less as a result of that 

174.32 175.26 B: um 

177.82 179.06 B: i think i do 

179.42 181.25 B: i think i do i think uh 

181.26 186.76 B: [noise] in order to you know take three airplanes all simultaneously 

186.94 193.47 B: the amount of planning that must have taken and the ease at which it seems like they've done it [noise] um 

193.82 197.02 B: [lipsmack] i was just at the airport [noise] i guess uh 

197.95 199.24 B: [mn] i guess 

199.25 205.95 B: four five months ago and they said my camcorder bag had [noise] residue on it i was in disney 

206.03 208.05 A: mhm 

206.20 219.12 B: and [noise] you know they searched me they searched me for forty five minutes they were swabbing everything [noise] uh asking me where i've been and and you know people are still getting on airplanes with 

219.30 223.88 B: you know they're getting through security um you know there's metal 

222.88 232.73 A: [noise] [noise] see my my feeling is that security is not going to be something that's foolproof but it reduces the chances that something's going to happen and i think that is the case 

229.23 230.59 B: oh absolutely 

232.51 239.89 A: either it will deter somebody or else will reduce the chance if somebody does try and and both of them i think are happening 

232.52 233.27 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

239.25 248.06 B: right i i think they they realised that there were some major there are holes in the security and uh you know hopefully they're working on that 

248.22 252.15 B: improve that but uh i think for for students 

252.28 253.49 B: (( students )) 

253.60 260.86 B: still are impacted my students are impacted on it still to this day [noise] they talk about it as if it happened yesterday 

261.01 262.13 B: um 

262.80 274.49 B: you know and we had uh a lot of counsellors from from other s- you know other schools helping us and other everyone's helping each other to deal with it 'cause kids now felt vulnerable and 

273.82 277.16 A: [noise] what what grade level or what age are you talking about elementary 

275.76 281.51 B: this is uh sixth through eighth grade middle school middle school students and uh 

277.87 280.53 A: okay middle school yeah 

281.57 282.19 A: (( [cough] [lipsmack] )) 

282.38 287.26 B: you know i think uh you know i it obviously affected the travel industry for a while 

287.87 292.48 B: and there's people don't want to fly even though it's probably one of the safest forms of transportation 

292.49 297.97 A: yeah 'cause i think i do look at it as well what are the other uh dangers that we face 

297.87 307.72 A: and i think i worry more about the other guy driving down the street you know we just have a lot of trust that on a two lane road the other guy's going to stay on his side of that double yellow line 

307.33 308.56 B: right 

307.95 311.49 A: and that may not happen not even deliberately 

309.45 310.20 B: right 

310.84 311.97 B: right 

311.36 314.29 A: that could happen something could go awry 

314.12 327.06 A: and and that could be the end of it and i- i i think i feel somewhat fatalistic that um [lipsmack] well it's going to happen at some point and not all of it's in my control maybe i i try not to get too worked up over it 

324.27 325.44 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

326.48 341.17 B: well it was reported two weeks ago in the philadelphia area that there was a a known terrorist they got videotape of him driving around the city and videotaping videotaping uh you know certain areas that he would like to 

341.15 347.57 B: you know visit su- supposedly and uh you know it's scary this guy's driving down 

347.60 362.40 B: you know uh the franklin met was uh i just heard from a police chief in the local area the franklin met you know they were looking to you know to hit that area uh that last plane [noise] was probably headed for the white house 

362.03 363.76 A: [noise] right right [noise] 

362.57 363.86 B: (( [noise] um )) 

363.96 366.62 B: it w- it's just amazing on 

367.60 371.11 B: how quickly everyone's opinion changed on 

371.10 382.82 B: you know safety procedures dealing with with that and and i think you know every day i'm thinking [noise] you know is is things safer [noise] and i went to drop my wife off at the airport and uh 

373.60 374.61 A: (( but are )) 

382.84 384.21 B: it was kinda [noise] just dr- 

384.20 398.95 B: drop her off and and go make sure she got to her area and so i didn't want to park my car in in short term parking and here i came out uh they'd already ticketed the car and they were towing it 'cause they were afraid that i was within 

398.76 408.84 B: an area that was close enough to cause problems at that airport so they're like daily o- you know not they aren't daily reminders but there there's always reminders out there on 

408.77 410.62 A: recurring reminders 

408.90 413.73 B: on the c- recurring right security things like that 

411.17 412.29 A: yeah 

413.31 417.24 A: yeah well i am more aware i i am paying attention i know 

417.02 430.01 A: eh where i work i work at the department of energy [noise] and we do have some security there for the building and there are things like well if they were really serious maybe they ought to be improving it in this way or i'm happy to see that they're doing some 

429.84 442.33 A: some other aspect to uh better than they were doing before uh or something doesn't really help but i'm i'm more aware of it more conscious of it now what i think is interesting is 

438.81 441.05 B: (( right no i think )) 

442.36 446.89 A: [lipsmack] uh at least i and i think many or most people around here felt more 

446.91 452.94 A: impacted or threatened by the sniper that we had uh more recent times 

452.67 453.69 B: okay 

453.47 459.63 A: and i i think that was ma- maybe because it was more stretched out in time rather than it happened one day 

453.72 454.39 B: (( now )) 

458.77 465.61 B: oh in the washington area now i remember the one you're talking about yeah and that was the father son combo 

460.37 461.91 A: exactly 

462.54 464.43 A: exactly the two guys 

465.54 479.40 A: uh i- it was really a a father figure he wasn't really uh they weren't really uh related by blood bu- but he was basically a father type figure for the kid [noise] i think seventeen year old 

473.11 474.35 B: (( oh okay )) 

478.79 482.80 B: [noise] [noise] yeah that was that was scarier that was stretched over a long period of time 

482.20 494.09 A: i think a couple weeks and people felt like hey i really could be the next one if i go outside and i would question myself about do i really need to go out now 

487.36 488.19 B: right 

493.93 497.30 A: but usually i did it didn't stop me from going out 

496.75 498.89 B: okay but you did question it 

499.21 500.39 A: [lipsmack] yes 

500.41 506.86 A: yeah do i need to go out now that i am out can i combine some things so i don't have to make another trip 

501.97 502.77 B: right 

506.55 507.61 B: (( mhm mm )) 

506.91 517.06 A: or this is in the neighborhood of a place he hit in fact that still happens when we would be driving by a particular gas station somebody was killed there 

517.10 520.83 A: by the post office that's the bench where the woman was killed 

520.67 521.62 B: okay 

521.44 524.91 A: yeah so it somehow there's there's uh that consciousness too 

524.72 525.97 B: right 

525.93 529.51 A: ha- have you had any other experiences um 

529.80 532.39 A: (( [lipsmack] threatening in some way )) 

531.77 534.99 B: now we what we're always afraid of is 

534.86 549.39 B: is the parent in in school that doesn't have custody of a child [noise] that that wants to come in and get the child and doesn't matter [noise] who stands in their way [noise] now my building is fifty feet from the high school 

544.66 546.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

549.40 555.72 B: and the doors unlock at certain times of every day so that students can students move between the two buildings 

555.75 567.46 B: it wouldn't take i- it would be very simple for someone to get into my building very simple and you know that that worries me because we we have shared services and uh [lipsmack] 

559.88 561.32 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

567.82 574.72 B: and yeah it w- i- i- anyone could just just walk in the building at any time almost and uh 

575.69 580.07 B: and what do i have a walkie talkie you know to you know to call the police 

579.40 583.76 A: [noise] and they'll be there in a few minutes but uh who knows by then 

581.48 582.34 B: right 

583.57 585.82 B: right so um 

585.32 588.48 A: [noise] do you have any threats of like gang activity 

587.59 599.89 B: ye- uh no we're not we're not bad with that at least uh we are near uh i'm actually in new jersey but philadelphia's maybe a five minute drive but uh the city of camden which is 

590.45 591.45 A: okay 

596.57 597.76 A: okay
