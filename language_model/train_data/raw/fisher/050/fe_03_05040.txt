1.88 3.17 B: (( hello )) 

3.22 4.71 A: (( [noise] hello )) 

4.60 6.05 B: how are you good 

5.35 8.32 A: i'm pretty well how about yourself 

7.85 9.18 B: i'm just fine 

9.41 11.65 A: (( [noise] [noise] good [noise] [noise] )) 

10.79 21.34 B: thank you um i don't particularly have a problem with the high salaries such that they make the owners of the team very wealthy so i think that they should get a portion 

21.34 33.20 B: and actually the portion that they get is very minimal when you take into account uh the monies that are made off of their backs so i don't have a problem with that 

33.65 36.33 B: uh what i do have a problem with is 

36.64 42.57 B: uh when athletes [sigh] don't use their monies properly and properly i mean 

42.79 55.82 B: if in a year [sigh] they are financially broke uh that doesn't make much sense to me uh when they could have invested it and uh maybe put it back into the community um 

56.39 57.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

56.74 58.67 B: and used their money as uh 

59.01 60.58 B: a bit better but 

59.42 64.35 A: (( [sigh] )) 

60.97 64.70 B: nah i really don't have a problem with the amount of money that they 

66.73 67.86 B: make what about you 

67.43 73.50 A: well i don't have a problem with the money that they make um as far as how they use it 

73.80 74.92 A: um 

75.12 79.76 A: as long as they're not specifically using it to [noise] injure 

80.13 81.67 A: other people 

82.87 86.39 A: people that may be neighbors or relatives 

86.85 93.89 A: or friends of theirs specifically to hurt them um if they want to waste it that's um [noise] 

93.97 96.80 A: i i think that uh 

96.85 101.13 A: that's o- that's okay if that's what they want to do [noise] 

102.03 102.82 B: (( mhm mm um )) 

103.72 111.53 B: i guess i just have a problem with that because uh they're put into a position of uh 

105.14 107.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

113.88 115.11 B: of having 

115.48 119.68 B: an extreme lifestyle um and i think 

119.77 121.46 B: that you should 

121.82 125.69 B: try to develop yourself as a person um 

126.25 134.11 B: being privileged because a lot of athletes are coming up to high school they have this dream of becoming a professional athlete 

134.52 144.78 B: and so the people that actually get through i think they ha- should feel some responsibility um to do the right thing once they have that opportunity 

140.36 141.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

146.74 152.69 B: um but of course you can't really control what people do with their money but i think it is detrimental 

152.50 154.08 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

153.34 158.99 B: just because media the media is very uh influential 

159.04 170.02 B: in children's lives and they see these athletes um out of control and then they emulate them so they are indirectly hurting other people 

170.10 174.48 B: um with irresponsible behaviour because it is so public mhm 

175.31 179.67 A: [noise] [noise] well i i agree with the last part that um 

181.07 183.60 A: if uh something 

184.22 186.17 A: antisocial 

186.88 188.86 A: is publicized 

188.93 198.02 A: [lipsmack] and a child sees that that there's a danger that the child might try to um mimic that however 

198.51 202.13 A: um the child doesn't live in a vacuum 

201.80 203.18 B: that's true mhm 

202.95 204.56 A: (( and um )) 

205.53 210.96 A: parents presumably should be aware of that possibility 

212.36 218.78 A: [mn] so i think maybe it's uh incumbent upon the parents to do something the same as if 

218.81 227.03 A: there are no cars whatsoever in the street so you send your child out to walk across the street by themselves simply because you don't see cars 

227.44 228.41 A: um 

229.51 237.19 A: i would have a problem just on behalf of your child if you did that but i would never dream of doing that if my children were small enough to get hurt 

238.04 242.04 A: and and didn't have enough sense to look both ways 

241.10 242.61 B: right 

242.68 251.12 A: so i would wanna w- kind of walk with them or give them some instructions so if if that thing is happening and i suspect that it is 

251.91 252.94 A: um 

253.08 260.59 A: i think that that should just be an ad- additional bit of instruction that the parents should um should add to their list 

261.39 265.14 B: well i guess if everyone did their part um 

266.56 273.62 B: in feeling some sense of responsibility uh for the images that are produced through the media then 

273.85 281.63 B: parents wouldn't have to be uh so over protective about the things that their children see and parents 

281.59 289.40 B: can not be with that child at all times uh children are exposed to some of these things through other children at school 

289.54 295.41 B: that it would be virtually impossible to filter out the negative 

295.29 296.28 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

295.54 297.23 B: (( um images )) 

296.30 296.87 A: (( [sigh] )) 

297.71 307.49 B: that your children are going to encounter but i think if everyone and and not to say that those athletes are to raise your your children for you 

307.66 313.69 B: but when you are in the public eye i think you should just think about those things um 

313.62 326.49 B: because you you realize that people are looking at you and they are wanting to have your life and they feel that whatever you do is going to be okay because you're successful 

318.69 325.56 A: mhm 

326.94 331.01 B: um and just acknowledging that i i think people 

331.24 332.45 B: should 

333.35 338.23 B: a- even be more private and discreet about their uh 

336.52 337.67 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

338.17 339.36 A: (( [noise] )) 

338.72 340.02 B: (( their uh )) 

339.96 341.80 A: (( indiscretions they )) 

340.27 345.69 B: in- yes indiscretions that is the word i'm looking for um a- a- a- and 

346.41 352.37 B: just for that i'm not saying it should run their lives but they should just be careful about the images 

356.04 358.78 B: that um they're putting out there because they are in a position of privilege 

358.69 359.79 A: are what 

359.42 361.66 B: they're in a position of privilege 

361.93 366.87 A: i agree i agree i agree that they are um 

367.43 379.31 A: my honest feeling is although i don't wanna be thought of as distancing myself from the problem i recognize it as a problem [sigh] but uh i've got um seven children 

378.87 380.24 B: mhm wow 

380.13 383.24 A: uh five are out on their own 

382.45 383.35 B: uh-huh 

383.89 390.73 A: and uh if if i didn't uh teach them or if we didn't teach them correctly [mn] 

390.74 391.75 A: um 

391.76 395.80 A: within the first three or four years of their life then shame on us 

395.37 396.72 B: (( right [mn] mhm )) 

396.12 397.61 A: and i um 

398.36 400.50 A: i wouldn't think that um 

400.82 403.21 A: i would have a legitimate beef 

403.38 412.79 A: [noise] um placing gain uh guilt rather on on a. b. c. d. and e. simply because it didn't occur to me 

413.01 420.75 A: uh i i i don't think you can be over protective of a child i th- i think that that is a um 

420.96 422.66 A: a relative term 

424.21 428.44 A: [mn] and uh i i've heard of children that drown 

429.43 435.61 A: at a home swimming pool or at a friend's home swimming pool or at a public swimming pool [sigh] 

436.20 443.62 A: and uh the parents um scream where was the lifeguards and my immediate reaction is where was the parent and uh 

442.50 444.78 B: (( mhm right )) 

445.95 448.10 A: i i i 

448.22 452.46 A: i i i prefer being proactive rather than reactive 

452.48 457.83 A: and i i just think that steps can be taken to um 

458.32 461.44 A: to protect yourself and your own 

462.60 465.99 A: and uh i think most people 

466.49 471.59 A: uh know about all the pitfalls or many of them or most of them 

472.61 483.55 A: and uh why why would you not want to be careful i d- i don't understand that i i think if if a um i think it's shameful 

483.90 486.64 A: [mn] that somebody would squander 

487.32 493.88 A: uh quick money uh i think it's shameful if they behave in an antisocial fashion 

494.62 498.45 A: [noise] but i i um don't believe in um 

499.63 503.80 A: [noise] societal intervention certainly not mine 

506.45 510.89 A: [mn] and um that's that's kind of h- h- how i feel i think everybody 

511.12 514.19 A: uh deserves a chance to stand on their own 

514.98 518.84 B: mhm mhm mhm yes i agree i just i i see 

519.00 524.21 B: what happens with uh children looking at these athletes 

524.42 528.27 B: and sometimes not having a role model 

527.04 528.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

529.23 533.12 B: um that is in front of them so they search for role models on 

533.79 539.27 B: television and i i just kind of wish that people were a bit more responsible being in that position 

539.58 547.35 B: of luxury but i don't have a problem with the initial payment because i think they deserve it um they 

548.01 553.57 B: go through strenuous training and they put their bodies through a lot of physical pain 

552.47 554.84 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] ab- absolutely )) 

553.78 554.89 B: um 

554.94 565.56 B: and as i said when you really look at the percentage that they are gaining versus the profits of the whole organization it's not really that much 

565.59 568.87 B: um those owners are coming away with 

568.91 572.12 B: um a very large percentage 

572.41 577.05 B: uh and they and they don't uh they're not out on the field 

577.36 579.60 B: uh risking their 

577.58 586.74 A: [noise] well i i i i agree i agree that they deserve it i i absolutely agree that they deserve every single penny that they get 

580.02 583.17 B: muscles and bones so 

587.09 590.26 A: um whether they train hard or whether 

590.41 596.31 A: you know whether their brother in law owns the team i i think that you know they're entitled to it [sigh] 

592.60 593.85 B: (( [noise] right )) 

596.38 598.75 A: and uh once they've paid their 

599.50 599.89 A: (( t- ))
