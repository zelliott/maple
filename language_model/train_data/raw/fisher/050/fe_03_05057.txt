17.08 18.20 B: that's good 

19.26 21.15 B: mhm that's always 

20.06 21.23 A: but um 

21.52 23.49 A: but uh where where are you calling from 

23.41 24.66 B: i'm in hawaii 

24.58 29.28 A: uh-huh my gosh i i don't even want to talk to you i'm in philadelphia 

25.94 27.11 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

29.30 30.95 B: okay oh i have a father in 

29.49 33.28 A: what's the is it eighty nine degrees and sunny out there 

32.92 35.56 B: uh eighty but yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

34.01 36.12 A: uh you're hurting my feelings 

37.03 42.47 A: all right well i don't see now i don't i don't know if you in in like hawaii there's a lot of uh 

42.78 55.87 A: a lot of professional athletes but i know in philadelphia we have a lot of professional athletes that get paid a whole of money um i believe they should be able to strike 'cause everyone should have that opportunity but at the same time they're making 

46.74 47.94 B: right yeah 

55.67 61.96 A: you know two hundred three hundred percent what the rest of the world is actually making two hundred percent more 

60.54 61.44 B: right 

61.88 72.11 A: um i think you know if you look at it i i heard that the general who ran the war did made a hundred and sixty five thousand dollars he makes that a year 

72.13 72.93 B: mhm 

72.41 75.67 A: alan arvison makes fifteen thousand dollars a year 

76.21 89.02 A: you know and and it just seems it just seems backwards you know i think our priorities in this world have changed from you know the real life stuff to entertainment uh i don't know but 

79.78 80.63 B: right 

86.35 87.55 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

89.30 96.09 B: yeah i mean i i don't really have a problem with them striking but i do have more of a problem with the the pay salaries that they're getting 

96.27 98.46 B: as opposed to teachers who make 

98.55 111.14 B: very little and and are you know supposed to be guiding our young people um and in i know i have five brothers so i although i don't follow sports very often i know my brothers do 

103.13 104.15 A: that's right 

111.35 114.61 B: and so i do know you know some things about it 

114.66 115.43 A: (( right )) 

114.72 118.19 B: and um i remember growing up 

118.20 124.05 B: i don't recall the salaries that are are out there now that that a lot of these professional athletes are demanding 

124.27 127.07 B: and um i think it does take away 

127.47 134.49 B: from the sport because like baseball used to be well it still is the american pastime and everything else but 

134.00 135.45 A: right 

135.04 147.01 B: but when you when you're making it [sigh] all about the money you know you lose the the sense of community i i've gone to you know fun team games and everything where you have certainly 

147.21 149.73 B: um where you're still getting paid a lot less 

149.86 150.62 A: right 

149.95 153.96 B: and you know it's it's a community event and it is a family event 

154.14 161.13 B: and um with all the salaries that are going up and it in some of the striking i mean it depends on 

161.33 165.60 B: what they're striking for 'cause i haven't followed a lot of strikes in the last couple of years 

165.51 166.26 A: right 

165.65 173.01 B: but um you know when they're when they're striking because they demand more money well [laughter] you go back to that whole last issue 

173.02 179.12 A: yeah and and we're struggling to get by to pay for their salaries do you understand it's it's it's i mean 

176.56 178.26 B: exactly yeah yeah 

178.99 185.67 A: i look at the city of philadelphia we have we have more people moving out of philadelphia than moving into philadelphia 

185.51 196.94 A: it's a it's an exodus because now we're getting taxed for the new stadiums that they're building that you know everyone didn't have the opportunity to to actually you know voice their opinion on 

185.74 186.55 B: okay 

196.82 211.51 A: the government the government of uh pennsylvania and philadelphia decided we need a new football field okay so that's three hundred million dollars they say we need a new baseball field that's three hundred million dollars now half of that the c- the the the tax payers have to pay for 

197.00 198.10 B: right 

204.24 205.16 B: mhm 

211.73 212.75 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

212.10 223.90 A: so so we're stuck with three hundred million dollars worth of taxes that are eventually going to be either you know sales tax on you know uh cigars or or drinks 

223.72 234.32 A: or uh you know higher real estate taxes and and we don't have people staying in philadelphia as it is so that means more taxes on less people so i i look at i 

232.94 239.00 B: and then that also means when you go to the stadium to watch the game you know the ticket prices are going to go up 

234.76 235.95 A: (( yeah )) 

238.44 248.21 A: oh i can i you know i i go i go there i go to games i'm luc- i'm lucky i i i'm able to get tickets for uh forty dollars and i can sit under the basketball court right underneath the court 

246.93 247.95 B: mhm 

248.18 258.70 A: now if i were to take my family or or say i take four or five people with me you know those tickets would cost almost a hundred and seventy five to you know three hundred dollars apiece 

253.20 254.20 B: mhm 

258.98 259.79 B: right 

259.00 266.37 A: apiece and i i mean one one event is it would would be you know a mortgage note for two or three months 

266.22 267.23 B: mhm 

266.55 275.66 A: just just to take my family out to enjoy it and and now we have to pay for the cable that's another thing that makes me mad if we don't have the cable we can't watch the games 

275.59 276.47 B: mhm 

275.59 288.17 A: so i mean it's a disservice in all aspects that they make that much money and we don't get the type of of return i i mean it's watered down everything's watered down because of the money and that's what it comes to 

279.83 281.06 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

286.91 288.05 B: mhm 

288.49 301.16 B: yeah i know um from my experience in western new york that a lot of times the games won't even be be broadcast unless they sell ex amount of tickets or a certain percentage of the the stadium that sells you know tickets are sold 

300.11 302.56 A: right a blackout they call it a blackout 

301.60 312.32 B: exactly yeah so i mean then you you you lose out there too you know and you can't what you say you know you can't even take your family to to enjoy this event because you know [laughter] it's like a one in five year event 

302.65 303.55 A: yeah 

310.60 322.55 A: well at least i can afford baseball tickets i can afford those you know they're seven to twelve dollars to get in you know and and going to see the phillys you really you you you could pay seven ten dollars and sit down off off the third base 

314.09 315.49 B: mm [laughter] 

320.51 321.97 B: (( [laughter] )) 

322.78 323.75 B: right 

323.40 330.43 A: so you know it'll it'll we we spent three hundred million dollars on our three aces this year and we're still we're still in third place 

327.97 328.81 B: okay 

330.42 335.86 A: you know but it's the best thing that's happened to to philadelphia in a long time we just lost our basketball coach 

330.52 331.46 B: mhm 

335.70 336.96 A: we lost him 

336.85 350.12 A: and it's all over money you know if if if if it wasn't such a high standard and and i i really blame a lot of this on the owners that have all this money because we should be complaining to them too because they have all this money and they can afford to pay these people our sal- 

338.41 339.34 B: mhm 

345.52 346.56 B: mhm 

350.05 352.18 A: you know these salaries that are outrageous 

351.38 352.30 B: right 

352.09 366.44 A: and we continue on and and it doesn't trickle down to us where we should be getting tickets you know there was a an article in the newspaper why don't since we're spending all this money on these stadiums we should be allowed to go to one game per year for free 

366.44 367.37 B: right 

367.04 380.42 A: for free and it but it'll never work out that because it's money and those salaries have to be paid to these you know these uh these uh athletes but um yeah i mean this is a interesting topic we we you know i i've i've done this is my third call now 

370.19 370.99 B: right 

374.63 375.78 B: mhm 

380.44 381.35 B: mhm 

380.98 383.07 A: and uh how many have you done so far 

383.01 384.62 B: this actually my first one 

384.47 398.42 A: oh okay okay well you know at least you you got somebody like me that'll just keep on talking i could say that they're they're lucky they're lucky that they don't have you know hour conversations because i if if they if they would let me do it i would do it trust me 

389.20 391.13 B: [laughter] that's right [laughter] 

397.34 400.34 B: [laughter] all depends on the topic yep [laughter] 

399.17 412.12 A: [laughter] you know [laughter] what i'm but but yeah it's very interesting that that that um that these guys and and i can't understand how they keep just going up the salaries just keep going up 

401.21 402.99 B: mhm yes 

410.39 411.41 B: i know 

412.17 421.77 B: yeah e- every year you hear about some new ath- some other athlete who is getting you know who has broken the the the cap that they're going even higher than they ever did before and it's 

421.83 431.84 B: and that just leaves it open to the following year that other people want that and so it's it's no longer about the sport it's about how much money [noise] they can make [noise] 

431.27 440.85 A: yeah and and high school look look at high school basketball now all of a sudden there is more high school basketball players coming out of high school to go to n._b._a. because of the money because of the salaries 

438.94 439.89 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

440.63 442.35 A: they can say well you know 

442.13 456.85 A: we want some of that money too why should we have to go to college and that that that deters a lot of these kids who who really can't make the you know national basketball association from going to college and getting a education and being able to be a part of society that that'll make you know 

453.59 454.53 B: (( right mhm )) 

456.62 470.88 A: that'll continue to to help our economy grow but what happens is those kids see that two three million dollars they are guaranteed as soon as they sign if they're in the first twenty picks they they'll go take it lebron james just made ninety million dollars hasn't played one game of basketball yet 

466.17 467.39 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

470.79 472.34 B: yeah and it's 

471.51 478.81 A: ninety million dollars do you know i probably will never see ninety million dollars i might not even see it on television 

476.47 478.79 B: [laughter] [laughter] i hear you there [laughter] 

478.95 480.19 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

479.43 482.92 A: [noise] that that's just endorsements that not even his salary 

482.79 484.08 B: mhm 

483.56 488.98 A: that's why it's un- it's unbelievable i i can't even imagine you know ninety million dollars 

489.02 491.52 B: yeah i know it'd be nice but [laughter] 

489.06 490.63 A: it's it's ridiculous 

491.24 494.34 A: i mean it's like he hit the lottery you know what i mean 

493.69 494.97 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

494.39 499.84 A: it's what one out of two billion or whatever well he just hit it and that's ninety million ninety 

498.23 503.46 B: yeah and as long as he you know doesn't blow it you know he's all set for life but you know 

502.55 504.65 A: well you well the 

504.49 518.31 A: well the n._b._a. recently they since the n._b._a. and n._f._l. all those players that are coming out now saying oh we're broke well now they've they've gotten these accountants and and and the n._b._a. sponsors all that stuff their agent takes care of all that stuff 

518.11 526.20 A: as long as you know they don't put 'em in in stupid uh stock transactions they should be good for the rest of their lives 

525.95 527.22 B: mhm 

526.02 537.11 A: but they you know they do they do spend a lot of money i mean those cars i've i've seen guys have sixteen seventeen cars i i still don't understand that but i don't know what ninety million dollars is either so i can't say nothing 

533.29 534.30 B: yeah i don't 

536.14 550.53 B: [noise] yeah but it it it it does go back to education too because you know they a lot of these like you said a lot of them are going in from high school who don't complete college who don't have the the real world experiences 

550.67 557.68 B: of how to manage your money how to interact with people on a day to day basis they deal with their agents 

552.63 553.41 A: (( yeah right )) 

557.80 562.85 B: and they deal with you know their coaches and everything but they don't a lot of them don't interact 

562.96 564.21 B: with um 

564.44 566.77 B: with normal people [laughter] 

565.98 572.55 A: right right exactly you you you you said the right word normal people 'cause people with ninety million dollars aren't normal

573.33 580.83 A: that is not normal to me if if i lived next door to a ninety million person i'd be over there cutting his lawn do you know what i mean 

579.04 581.55 B: (( [laughter] that's right [laughter] )) 

580.66 592.37 A: 'cause let me tell you something i want to be his best friend but that's another thing they have to worry about you have you have now you have these women and and and and people are just coming out of the woodwork say oh i'm your cousin from uh twenty five
