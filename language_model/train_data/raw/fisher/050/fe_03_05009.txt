5.16 6.76 A: darren how you doing darren 

5.68 7.65 B: uh this is charlie brown 

7.83 9.05 A: charlie brown 

8.67 10.51 B: yeah in the flesh 

9.29 11.97 A: (( [laughter] w- )) 

10.95 12.86 B: just like in the funny papers 

12.58 16.24 A: well i said how how's snoopy doing [laughter] 

15.16 16.51 B: (( oh fine )) 

17.11 22.08 A: [laughter] well anyways i guess uh september eleventh's the topic huh um 

21.24 27.37 B: yeah well i believe she said what changes we've made as a result of that 

26.66 30.48 A: yeah i guess that's kinda what the topic was um 

29.10 30.86 B: yeah 

30.63 33.24 A: as far as myself personally uh 

33.37 42.31 A: you know none really i guess i uh i don't really fly that much so i don't really have to deal with uh you know um people you know 

42.39 49.50 A: suspicious of me being a terrorist or anything like that but uh [sigh] i don't know you know i i guess america 

45.11 46.77 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

49.67 56.08 A: i guess everybody changed after that i mean i think more so in attitude more so than in actions 

52.58 53.14 B: (( [sigh] )) 

55.21 58.25 B: yeah i think that's where the secret is 

58.28 59.50 A: you know i mean 

58.30 61.27 B: [sigh] i like and i i have 

61.33 65.24 B: personally i pay a lot more attention to the news than i did before 

65.24 78.22 A: [cough] well i think the thing is is that you know i think americans always had this kind of false security that you know somehow or another america was removed or above all the world problems you know 

72.18 73.98 B: yeah 

77.57 79.29 B: yeah 

78.36 90.51 A: and you know the thing is is that that's okay until somebody comes along and totally shatters it you know and i think that's what happened on september eleventh we began to realize that you know 

85.79 87.01 B: yeah 

90.35 95.49 A: it's a dangerous world and just 'cause we're americans you know uh 

95.42 106.47 A: we were you know we're we're not safe i mean we're just as we can be as just an easy target as let's say israel or um whatever country you wanna name you know 

103.31 105.23 B: [mn] yeah we're 

105.34 107.52 B: we're certainly not immune are 

107.45 108.83 A: what's that 

107.96 110.81 B: we i say we're certainly not immune to 

110.55 114.32 A: no and you know they're saying this is that you know it uh 

111.14 113.06 B: (( it yeah )) 

114.13 126.53 A: it could happen again you know and uh you know that's a scary thought but [sigh] i guess you know it's that's that's the reality we live in we live in a world where there is people that um 

115.56 117.33 B: yeah 

126.82 137.71 A: are so hateful that they'll do any action to uh you know uh get their point across and that's unfortunate because i said you know uh darren was your name 

131.47 132.21 B: (( mm )) 

137.01 138.82 B: do what 

138.23 140.25 A: oh charl- charlie uh 

139.33 141.43 B: charles yeah 

140.24 153.85 A: yeah uh you know like i said personally speaking like i said i think it's more an attitude than it is any kind of action i mean i i am not a survivalist i'm not you know like uh you know bottling water in my basement [laughter] or anything like that you know 

149.69 150.85 B: yeah 

151.64 154.74 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

154.09 158.58 A: but uh you know and the and the thing is i i guess you know 

158.78 170.16 A: [cough] america can america survived september eleventh and you know i guess the only thing that scares me personally is the fact that i just hope none of these lunatics 

170.96 173.58 A: [cough] get their hands on nuclear weapons 

173.10 177.66 B: yeah yeah 

173.68 174.93 A: (( i mean you know )) 

175.04 187.48 A: there you're starting to talk about some serious stuff you know because those boys are i you know the the sad fact is is i don't think any of 'em hesitate to even think twice about using them if they had 'em you know 

187.39 188.58 B: (( [mn] yeah [noise] )) 

187.96 193.34 A: and 'cause they don't probably don't give a rat's butt who they take with them you know 

193.24 195.31 B: yeah 

193.37 205.29 A: and that that's kind of uh and i said you know that that can you know that can scare you but on the other hand you know life goes on you can't sit around and uh be fearful twenty four seven you know you uh 

204.36 206.47 B: right have to 

205.33 206.79 A: life does go on 

206.54 210.02 B: have to take care of business as business comes along [sigh] 

210.31 224.00 A: well [sigh] ou know it uh i said it it does i mean life goes on you know and it's sad that all those people died i mean it it's it's it's tragic you know and i guess to me the thing that really 

210.49 212.18 B: yeah 

221.64 223.31 B: (( yeah )) 

223.79 228.36 A: if anything makes me angry is the fact that we have 

228.32 232.68 A: sometimes these heartless politicians playing politics with 

231.92 235.47 B: [sigh] [laughter] yeah yeah [noise] 

232.61 244.59 A: all those people's lives and um you know to me that's something that you know is unforgivable i mean they're anybody that does that they're just as bad as the terrorists as far as i'm concerned you know 

243.19 244.88 B: (( yeah they don't have any )) 

244.96 246.13 B: business [noise] 

246.30 247.87 B: or authority do 

248.03 258.89 A: well you know it's it's one thing to try to improve the situation and you know um but when you play politics with a situation like that uh 

252.79 253.38 B: (( they )) 

253.40 253.97 B: (( [sigh] )) 

257.97 259.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

258.77 263.52 A: there's just no excuse for that i i and you know the sad fact is is that you know 

263.66 274.28 A: uh you know we do have to have a lot of changes in this country but you know the sad fact is is if you look at this government they're using september eleventh to uh 

269.95 270.51 B: (( [sigh] )) 

274.59 283.94 A: [lipsmack] compromise and take away a lot of our freedoms and they're doing it in the name of uh you know homeland security well 

278.22 280.00 B: yeah 

280.44 281.40 B: (( [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

283.86 294.49 A: yeah you know you can be as secure as you can have you know six machine guns surrounding you with body guards but somebody who wants to get to you they're gonna get to you you know 

290.08 293.05 B: mhm 

293.51 294.88 B: they'll find a way 

294.76 301.32 A: yeah exactly and um you know that's that's the thing that bothers me is is that you know they uh 

296.04 297.70 B: (( yeah )) 

301.37 310.82 A: they seem to be every time we turn around lately they're they're compromising america's freedom one way or another they're they're trying to take away 

311.18 325.98 A: [cough] you know they're trying to take away a lot of people's freedoms and you know they're trying to make life a lot harder on people of let's say minorities i mean let's say you're somebody who's uh from the middle east let's say you're somalian or whatever you know 

314.62 316.29 B: right 

326.05 338.18 A: it must be it must be hard to have to be in public places and you always have that eye watching you you know like some security guard or a policeman or whatever you know what i mean 

334.43 336.16 B: (( right )) 

337.25 338.99 B: yeah 

338.19 344.26 A: it it to me i i'm caucasian i don't have to deal with that but yet on the other hand [cough] 

344.31 352.50 A: the people that do have to deal with that i i feel s- i i feel real sympathy for 'em because i mean you could be just minding your own business 

352.38 363.56 A: and be perfectly harmless and just because you're a certain color or you're from a certain part of the world bam all of a sudden you know you're a instant suspect you know and uh 

363.66 365.69 A: [sigh] you know that that uh 

366.22 369.11 A: that isn't right you know any way you cut it i guess
