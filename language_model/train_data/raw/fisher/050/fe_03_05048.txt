0.31 3.10 A: how you doing i'm alan from new york city 

3.10 4.16 B: (( hi i'm )) 

4.46 7.38 B: from south florida lake worth 

6.63 7.90 A: how's it going 

7.69 9.04 B: (( all right )) 

8.79 11.23 A: so how do you about this [sigh] 

11.34 16.08 B: i honestly i feel like the amount that sports 

16.13 19.17 B: players get paid is a a pretty sad uh 

19.50 21.16 B: testimony to how 

21.45 22.01 B: (( [mn] )) 

22.61 23.46 A: uh 

22.92 29.99 B: strange our priorities are in this country where people could bust their ass all day and not [noise] get enough to feed their family and then someone can play sports 

30.04 35.37 B: doing what they love and and get by w- and then complain about it it's not enough and they're millionaires 

35.41 40.34 A: all right there's no doubt that [noise] professional athletes tend to be uh spoilt 

40.12 41.10 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

40.26 54.74 A: and egotistical but i don't know based on the economics of the situation oh it's obscene what they get paid don't get me wrong but it's a business and it's economics and if you can make ten dollars and i can make a dollar i say more power to you make the ten 

47.16 47.97 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

54.97 61.72 A: i i agree though like the the way they moan and they they they groan a- you think they're almost slave labors 

61.27 62.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yes )) 

61.75 69.22 A: [laughter] here in new york it's a it's kind of funny because we have the teams that can kind of afford to pay 

62.69 63.93 B: for real [sigh] 

69.09 69.92 B: (( [noise] uh- huh )) 

69.25 83.33 A: we're in a bigger market than a lot of other teams like in baseball and basketball and stuff uh because they have lot of media money and stuff and and yet still it seems that no matter what they do to spend the money they can't guarantee a win 

76.48 77.25 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

83.59 98.30 A: so like you got a guy like steinbrenner who all he cares about is winning and he's upset when they don't win and he's really pissed now the last few days i- i- in the papers they've been writing about how the losing streak for the yankees has gotten him really annoyed 

98.44 99.47 A: [laughter] 

99.03 102.37 B: [mn] yeah i don't understand the man for like sports is something that you play for 

102.54 111.49 B: and people can be paid more for [noise] for entertainment than for the thing that's the productive things that our our society really makes use of [noise] it's just a disappointing situation 

111.16 120.03 A: you got to you know take it in perspective think of a c._e._o. of a corporation are they worth five thousand times what a typical worker makes 

119.21 121.00 B: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

121.01 123.46 A: well that's what they're making sometimes 

122.51 130.96 B: [noise] i mean i agree i [noise] think that the c._e._o.s [noise] could [noise] stand to uh [noise] you know be [noise] in a more humble position 

130.99 133.55 B: in fact i think most industries could probably run 

133.61 143.85 B: without their bosses without c._e._o.s at all i think c._e._o.s just prop themselves up as being so important when the reality is [mn] the people that do the work could probably control the the industries they work for 

143.87 146.35 B: but i think it's just it's sort of just a an 

147.45 158.84 B: evolved slavery system you know that's what i think if anyone's making a million dollars while someone's making minimum wage that to me is probably just way worse than slavery i mean it's the same situation 

149.76 151.36 A: [laughter] 

158.95 163.66 B: you got someone who doesn't deserve what they have taking advantage of someone who who works too hard [sigh] 

164.07 165.78 A: it's it's pretty w- 

164.19 173.63 B: and as far as the sports role in that i feel like that's just a glaring uh statement a sad statement to what you know what kind of society we live in 

174.39 181.14 A: if it gets out of hand and it looks like it is in some cases uh with the bulk of the teams losing money 

180.85 181.76 B: (( yeah )) 

181.14 190.08 A: like in in basketball or in hockey [sigh] they'll wind up losing franchises and they'll wind up having less employment for these guys making all the big bucks 

189.76 190.90 B: yep 

190.79 196.25 A: you know i- i- i- it's weird like i mean like you look at a guy like tiger woods for instance 

196.52 197.90 A: he's probably 

198.00 212.91 A: worth every penny he makes for the advertising that he he brings in the i mean the promotional value he has he's really well paid and he makes it on the golf course too but i mean every single company who pays him money probably feels it's well worth it 

205.83 206.91 B: (( [noise] yep [noise] )) 

213.33 222.60 A: so i i- i- it's hard to say like i i mean like there are some baseball players making the minimum wage which i think is like a hundred and eighty thousand dollars 

213.65 214.76 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

222.59 228.60 A: probably doing just as well as some of the guys making twenty million some years [laughter] it's it's weird 

226.50 228.17 B: (( [mn] [sigh] yeah )) 

228.70 229.94 A: it really is 

231.51 235.38 A: have you uh done this these these uh talks on the phone often 

235.33 236.71 B: [sigh] [noise] no not so much 

236.98 238.70 A: how how many have you done 

238.32 239.80 B: this is actually the first one 

239.78 244.67 A: all right this is my actual third one i don't know how it actually works though 

242.47 243.46 B: (( [mn] yeah oh )) 

245.58 247.36 B: (( i haven't yeah i don't know either )) 

247.11 254.44 A: i i don't know how you get paid or anything like that in fact i don't even remember uh where it is i signed up 

251.59 253.65 B: (( [noise] )) 

253.73 255.22 B: [noise] [laughter] 

254.93 257.52 A: but they keep calling at four o'clock in the afternoon 

257.40 257.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

257.98 260.71 B: yep this is my first one so 

259.74 264.30 A: i- it was pretty interesting i thought they were going to have a moderator the first time 

263.70 264.56 B: (( oh )) 

265.14 267.32 A: so you're in uh lake worth you said 

266.35 268.29 B: (( [noise] [noise] yes )) 

267.47 268.98 A: what do you do down there 

268.82 273.46 B: [noise] [noise] all kind of stuff do you think they expect us to stay on the topic or doesn't it doesn't it really doesn't matter at this point 

272.99 274.79 A: i have no idea 

274.25 276.66 B: all right well [laughter] in that case 

275.61 279.42 A: but ten minutes on sports is a little bit more than i can speak 

278.82 281.09 B: yep i hear that for sure [mn] 

280.54 284.75 A: i i mean like basically we said it all the guys are probably overpaid 

284.20 286.32 B: [laughter] i agree 

286.23 295.21 A: i i went to school with uh in high school with i i i played basketball [mn] and i was uh off the bench i wasn't one of the uh starters 

294.64 296.14 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] [sigh] )) 

295.23 306.36 A: but i played on a team that won one game the whole season and the following season they lost everything every single game and we played against uh two different teams in brooklyn 

306.19 313.19 A: one was with a guy named lloyd b. free uh lloyd free actually he became welby free a professional basketball player 

309.02 309.96 B: (( [noise] lloyd )) 

312.86 313.72 B: (( free oh wow )) 

313.39 322.91 A: and the other uh team was with the king brothers bernard and albert king and they both became professionals and you could see back then even watching them play 

322.48 326.16 B: [noise] [noise] i never had any [noise] sports really in my in my blood 

325.46 326.42 A: oh no 

326.46 330.14 B: i played for like [noise] recreational soccer and some [noise] uh 

330.28 331.82 B: basketball 

331.85 332.81 B: (( [noise] but )) 

332.34 337.28 A: well what i started to say is you could see back then like the ego and the skill 

337.18 337.98 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

337.55 341.36 A: and and what it took to be like all to become professional 

341.48 346.33 A: and both of uh th- both king brothers became all stars and so did lloyd free 

346.74 348.97 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

348.10 351.06 A: he winded up changing his name to welby free 

350.42 351.65 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

351.44 352.83 A: his name was lloyd 

352.96 363.01 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] okay [noise] okay the only people that i know i think that i've that went on to become professional [noise] uh athletes and maybe where i could have i would have pursued it but i had a chance was skateboarding 

363.13 366.34 B: but none of them are are raking in millions of dollars either like 

365.53 368.38 A: no i guess you gotta be tony hawke for that 

367.80 370.10 B: yeah yeah there's a few [noise] [mn] 

369.79 382.19 A: i i wasn't a great ball player i was just very much into basketball and of course everyone's dream is to be a professional [sigh] but i never had the uh skill level to even get to be uh a college scholarship 

376.55 377.35 B: uh-huh 

382.03 385.35 A: but i enjoyed it in high school and and playing it afterwards 

385.91 389.37 A: it's something that i think was important part of life growing up but 

389.70 399.28 A: i i remember watching them and that you could see like thinking about it years later how they became professional they were just three four levels above everybody else 

395.35 396.56 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] yeah )) 

399.85 407.60 A: so i guess they were entitled to their money but i i don't begrudge any of 'em the money i like i said don't think they're worth it 

407.60 408.53 B: yep 

407.94 410.46 A: relative to society i guess but 

409.87 411.24 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

410.90 418.18 A: i i mean like when you read about like someone like derek gee that gets paid like s- thirty eight thousand dollars every time he goes to bat 

418.10 418.86 B: uh-huh 

418.61 420.04 A: it's o- obscene 

420.31 421.93 B: god yeah i can't even 

422.12 423.99 B: really can't even stomach it but 

423.42 430.34 A: you know o- o- like some of these guys like uh every hit he gets he- he's making like a hundred thousand dollars it- it's nuts 

430.32 431.04 B: (( yep )) 

430.95 433.30 A: that's really it- it- it's intense 

433.29 434.92 B: (( yeah )) 

433.96 438.14 A: i don't know if this was a great topic for them to pick i wonder what they do with this stuff though 

437.81 443.26 B: i have no idea i think it's a study on like the the dynamics of conversation i don't really know 

443.78 447.62 A: i really wish i knew more about it in that they would send me more information 

447.40 450.23 B: yeah but [laughter] 

450.11 453.57 A: this is the slowest ten minutes of my life [laughter] 

452.69 455.16 B: yeah for real well what're the other topics that you have 

454.83 459.09 A: uh minimum wage and i forget what the other one was 

456.68 458.01 B: (( uh that'd be good [noise] )) 

459.45 461.73 A: the minimum wage one was an interesting one 

462.86 465.07 B: yeah that's a good topic 

464.76 469.55 A: they called me yesterday for something but it w- not they couldn't get anyone else on the phone 

469.61 475.15 A: and i forget what the topic was it was it sounded like a boring topic anyhow they make you wait 

475.05 476.02 B: (( yeah )) 

475.40 480.54 A: on the line and like you came on right away so they must have had you waiting for me 

480.74 492.63 A: but uh last time i was waiting for someone and after a song plays uh they come back saying uh do you still want to wait we haven't found anybody and if you s- say no they'll [mn] maybe we'll call you back later 

493.25 496.58 A: and uh usually they call you back the next day 

496.89 499.11 A: i had set it up for four o'clock 

499.26 503.32 B: (( yeah yeah and the same with me oh i can't remember what times i said in particular but )) 

504.10 505.28 B: (( i um [lipsmack] )) 

506.23 507.55 B: most li- i mean i 

507.58 512.64 B: just put out my something to eat right in front of me and i wasn't expecting a phone call then but you can't turn it down 

512.42 514.73 A: i don't even know how you get paid 

514.15 516.73 B: well i think they s- b- i don't know jesus 

516.78 518.54 B: they send you a check or something 

517.96 522.14 A: i i gotta go find out where the website was where i signed up 

521.66 522.95 B: (( yep [noise] mhm )) 

522.31 528.66 A: yeah i must have saved it as a favorite in my laptop but i i don't even know in fact i was thinking about it this morning 

529.26 534.62 A: but uh i- it seems to me like they have some decent conversations though and some decent topics 

534.53 535.62 B: (( yeah )) 

534.98 539.06 A: if you are right about the dynamics of conversation and stuff 

539.07 544.92 A: that that makes sense then i i like i say i was disappointed there was no moderator i thought we'd be more give and take 

540.71 541.70 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

545.28 546.91 B: (( yeah )) 

545.85 549.91 A: uh it's it's you know 'cause ten minutes is a long time to speak to anybody 

550.42 551.29 B: that's true 

551.24 557.42 A: uh you know un- unless you're really into the person and [sigh] what's happening i suppose 

558.81 563.95 B: [mn] it's it's d- also like that when the the calls just come kind of unexpectedly 

564.10 567.49 A: no no y- when you signed up you gave 'em a time 

567.16 573.25 B: yes sure i think i did give 'em a time but i didn't necessarily write it down in my calendar so i was just kind of going about my day not expecting it 

572.87 577.25 A: [sigh] uh the actual phone rings like almost on the dot four o'clock 

576.66 578.64 B: (( wow all right well )) 

578.25 584.03 A: today was about a minute before but uh in in the past it's been like every single time right on the dot 

584.02 589.18 B: yeah i've a really open schedule so i think i pretty much just said i just 

589.28 591.62 B: [mn] gave a whole bunch of times i'm available so 

591.77 595.69 B: i can't even remember what you know what times i expect the calls but 

594.70 599.88 A: they'll call you if you can't do it you just say no or you press a button or something and then that's the end of it
