1.22 2.30 A: hello 

2.27 3.44 B: [noise] hello 

3.22 4.65 A: hello i'm jeff 

4.60 6.30 B: hey my name's dennis 

5.91 7.51 A: dennis where are you from 

6.96 8.88 B: from boston 

8.18 10.95 A: boston uh i'm uh from near philadelphia 

10.83 11.73 B: okay 

11.31 12.49 A: in south jersey 

13.13 13.69 B: (( all )) 

13.97 20.21 A: all right so what do you think about uh airline security [sigh] does it any uh lessen the chance of terrorism 

16.49 19.28 B: (( right )) 

20.28 25.74 B: um i suppose it might i guess i don't know 

25.94 31.86 B: i haven't flown in airplane in since i was a little kid so i don't know 

31.46 33.30 A: oh really uh how old are you now 

32.98 34.48 B: i'm twenty two 

34.27 38.11 A: twenty two okay i'm twenty seven myself i flew last summer 

38.19 43.17 A: so it was uh about nine months after september eleventh 

43.49 57.76 A: uh and i think uh it would to some degree i mean o- obviously if someone is really determined and has a lot of where with all they might be able to get around anything but uh something is better than nothing 

54.28 56.44 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

58.68 60.25 A: (( um um )) 

60.51 65.36 A: have you noticed any extra security outside of airlines or 

65.49 67.08 B: [noise] um 

68.00 78.26 B: yeah i took greyhound after september eleventh and there was sometimes but it was real like sometimes there was and sometimes there wasn't there wasn't anything like serious 

78.69 87.27 B: um they are like confiscating people's like knives or and tools a lot which was really annoying 'cause it wasn't like 

78.69 79.50 A: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

87.35 91.30 B: they they wouldn't even let you put things below like under the bus 

91.14 92.47 A: right okay 

92.22 97.46 B: which was like ridiculous it was it seemed like just an excuse to like steal people's stuff 

96.72 106.03 A: i understand well i mean obviously uh something is better than nothing so they could've phrased this uh topic a little better 

102.53 104.32 B: yeah 

105.82 107.69 B: yeah 

106.25 112.54 A: because i mean obviously you know is it safer yeah safer but you know the question is how safe 

112.97 114.20 A: and um 

115.01 119.08 A: so you know it's it's really hard to figure that out 

119.17 125.76 A: i mean uh without knowing the ins and outs of security but if they told you the ins and outs of security then 

126.15 128.62 A: it wouldn't be very secure now would it [sigh] 

128.20 129.11 B: right 

128.78 131.64 A: because uh they're not gonna tell you everything they do 

132.84 135.27 A: now are you comfortable with um 

135.63 136.54 A: uh 

136.77 144.08 A: more uh extensive background checks for uh going on airlines or buses or boats or things along those lines 

143.80 155.78 B: no i don't i don't like those at all um i think those are not cool 'cause uh i don't know like i then they're probably just gonna be excluding people that like 

155.97 160.38 B: they probably shouldn't like people who they don't need to for no good reason 

158.97 162.48 A: i understand well what if they don't exclude people but they 

162.51 167.60 A: uh just take a closer look at at people who fit a certain profile 

167.79 169.77 A: say uh you know if 

169.84 181.51 A: uh you just flew in from israel and we- men- you know through some other country through some other country and then you're going into the united states 

181.66 186.59 A: maybe they would take a closer look at you or something like that or kind of see more about you 

186.67 198.44 A: would you be comfortable with something like that or or or i guess what i'm trying to say is what criteria w- would you wanna use for uh looking at passengers or just look at everybody the same 

199.61 202.98 B: [noise] um probably everyone the same i mean 

203.17 213.43 B: i guess they have a list of like people who are wanted and when you've when you fly like they check that list maybe like that you gotta have like a 

208.07 209.20 A: right 

213.80 214.91 B: (( like a )) 

215.19 216.90 B: i._d. 

216.47 217.77 A: i understand 

216.97 224.22 B: to fly but anybody who's gonna do anything is gonna have like because probably chances are they're gonna have some sorta 

224.31 226.29 B: fake i._d. or whatever 

226.04 238.39 A: right now personally i'm not i do not mind if they look at people more closely but i would mind if they uh excluded people uh uh didn't allow them to travel 

238.37 241.93 A: um u- unless of course you know they were 

239.07 240.30 B: (( [noise] )) 

242.80 254.39 A: uh based more on on like you know what you said if they were on a most wanted list or something like that but excluding that i mean i wouldn't want someone to say you can't fly just because you fit some sort of profile 

254.05 257.08 B: right or like you [noise] 

254.40 255.41 A: but i wouldn't 

255.63 262.39 A: i wouldn't mind them say we're gonna look at you more closely because you do fit uh a description 

262.48 273.42 A: a- and and that doesn't mean like just because you're arab or just because you're any sort of thing but uh you know there is more things than race or religion that are involved [lipsmack] 

274.37 276.92 A: i don't know how do you feel about that 

276.22 281.04 B: um yeah i mean like i i agree i guess i think that uh 

281.75 287.75 B: excluding people from traveling based on like political views is pretty fucked up and i 

287.31 293.81 A: well uh yeah i wouldn't say yeah you wouldn't wanna exclude someone from traveling for any for those sort of reasons 

293.73 305.71 A: but if someone h- held a political view that they wanted you know say all jews to die or or you know they're pretty extreme of uh in some sort say they were a neo nazi or something like that you might wanna 

297.90 323.62 B: (( right )) 

305.72 307.56 A: give them more once over 

308.79 312.64 A: um now uh are you familiar with el al at all 

313.43 317.28 A: el al that's uh israel's uh national airline 

317.89 330.47 A: now what they do they do a lot of things but what they do is they ask you a series of questions before you get on board i i've never taken it so i'm just giving you anecdotal uh stories here 

330.40 336.37 A: but what they do is they say you know oh you're from boston where are you doing what what do you teach you know 

336.26 341.64 A: so they ask you they don't have the information but they ask you probing questions 

341.51 355.54 A: to kinda figure out you know what's your area code like if you if your story is that you are a teacher but you're actually a terrorist you know they're gonna ask you a lot of questions about teaching and stuff like that to kinda figure out if you're nervous 

355.45 363.30 A: during the questioning or if you're if you don't know anything about what you say you're doing or if you're saying you know i'm going 

363.48 371.27 A: if you say i'm c- getting connecting flights to tel aviv through berlin they'll say why are you going through berlin and they'll ask a few questions about that or 

371.30 373.58 A: where you know where you're going so 

373.69 377.42 A: um how do you feel like uh kind of a [mn] 

377.67 381.49 A: more a a technique like that to kinda weed out bad people 

381.83 383.57 B: (( with what no [noise] [noise] [noise] um )) 

384.96 386.92 B: i don't know i'm sorta 

387.25 394.11 B: hesitant to support anything like that just 'cause like i mean i'd be nervous 

394.46 397.71 B: myself not being a terrorist like being asked 

397.63 410.25 B: like by security personnel or police or whatever and stuff like that so i don't know like i'm not sure like how 

402.07 403.89 A: right i understand that 

410.49 414.52 B: exactly they do that so i don't know what what do you think about it 

414.37 427.22 A: well i think it's a good technique to have i mean obviously you don't wanna use just one technique you wanna use a multiple of techniques and i don't think you'd w- if you if someone came up like nervous or 

422.08 424.10 B: (( [noise] )) 

427.46 442.32 A: or as a person to watch out for because of one technique maybe you would search their bags a little more closely or you would do a background check of just that person or something like that as opposed to doing it everything for everybody 

442.07 443.01 B: uh-huh 

442.79 444.97 A: because you know you can't 

444.74 457.97 A: you can only you can only make things as safe as possible i think also one of the things that kind of this question might be missing is that a lot has to do with security but even more has to do with 

457.85 470.56 A: the reason why september eleventh worked was because in the past when people hijack planes they didn't ram it into anything they just ha- flew it to some airport and they had some confrontation somewhere 

470.69 481.68 A: and they had a list of demands and things like that they didn't use the plane as a weapon so when uh you can see it even in the the united flight ninety three the last plane 

481.76 490.60 A: that once they knew what was going on the passengers fought back and i part of the reason why september eleventh worked was because it was new 

490.72 495.07 A: like the only thing that could probably work now would be some sort of bomb 

495.47 508.82 A: or something like that because if someone tried to storm the cockpit the passengers and the pilot uh before while they might go along with the h- the the terrorist uh now they're not gonna do that 

508.93 510.02 A: um 

510.65 518.08 A: so uh one thing also el al does is they put their uh their suitcases through a sort of a pressure chamber 

518.45 528.06 A: so it uh simulates uh going up in altitude so when it if it reaches a certain altitude you know bombs are usually set to go off 

526.15 530.94 B: (( right )) 

528.49 534.94 A: so and you know [mn] it simulates you know um taking off and l- and coming back down 

535.28 546.91 A: and if it's uh set to go off at any stage uh the bomb uh will go off in the luggage but before they put it on the plane op- it'll be it'll go off in this machine 

545.44 547.82 B: [noise] 

547.30 549.66 A: so maybe uh it'd be nice if uh 

550.31 560.63 A: the uh uh federal government invested in something like that because i think terrorists would probably be more likely to bomb or do something like that than 

557.18 561.46 B: mhm 

560.67 562.93 A: than to do the same thing they did before 

565.73 567.22 A: do you have any thoughts on the matter 

567.24 571.97 B: (( [noise] uh yeah i guess that sounds like a all right thing to do )) 

572.07 573.41 A: all right thing to do 

574.65 581.76 A: yeah uh i guess we're outta things to i mean there's not really much to talk about because we've kinda been making up our own thing as we go along 

581.52 583.79 B: (( yeah )) 

582.70 586.19 A: it was like because we i mean we agreed from the outset yes it would be safer 

586.56 588.73 A: it would be better if uh you know 

587.27 592.17 B: (( yeah )) 

589.27 597.13 A: they had a more substantive issue or they uh uh had a more weighty topic or something like that or we disagreed vehemently there's 

596.90 598.64 B: (( [laughter] ta- [cough] )) 

598.10 599.72 A: probably make it more interesting
