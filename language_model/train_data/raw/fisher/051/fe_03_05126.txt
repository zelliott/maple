27.14 28.61 B: out there after

42.48 44.41 B: yeah yeah i 

44.87 57.31 B: i i i i realize that the uh in iraq they had an evil dictator but i really didn't think it was as much a threat to our country as 

57.49 62.73 B: north korea or other countries that uh have much more uh 

63.25 71.26 B: power more than wealth you know yeah china could actually be much more of a threat to us than iraq 

65.51 66.34 A: (( yes sir )) 

70.94 72.38 A: mhm 

71.54 73.00 B: (( you know so )) 

73.26 77.03 B: in in my way of thinking but 

77.13 78.51 B: (( there there )) 

78.57 81.02 B: that's what i would a- assume 

82.64 84.48 B: just from general 

84.71 91.52 B: what amazes me in some aspects as in my profession i talk to people all day long 

91.19 92.31 A: mhm 

91.67 93.46 B: (( and [mn] )) 

93.91 106.84 B: for the most part i would say seven out of ten agree with my thinking yet in all the polls everybody seems to support the president's thinking and i'd like to know i've never been called for any of those [laughter] polls 

102.77 103.93 A: mhm 

106.45 107.85 A: [laughter] 

107.29 112.50 B: nor anyone i know has ever been called for any of those polls yet 

112.40 122.31 B: you know [mn] it all seems you know they support the president's thinking and his cabinet's thinking and who who's supporting him you know 

117.45 118.68 A: right 

122.27 127.56 B: of course i come from i don't know where you're uh what part of the country you're in 

127.56 128.97 A: uh louisiana 

128.42 131.56 B: louisiana i'm in the northern part of ohio 

129.42 130.25 A: mhm 

131.31 132.48 A: mhm 

131.82 137.83 B: and ohio is basically a republican state except the very northern tip where i live 

137.68 138.63 A: mhm 

138.06 144.31 B: so it's and and the consensus even seems to be even from some of the republican 

144.72 150.35 B: that are are around our community that they're not as supportive of the 

150.76 153.45 B: his his uh goals 

153.09 154.97 A: right 

153.65 154.47 B: (( hm )) 

155.90 159.11 A: well uh my wife and i um 

159.97 163.46 A: louisiana is predominantly republican also 

163.06 164.23 B: mhm 

163.50 166.07 A: but my wife and i share democratic views 

166.18 167.45 B: mhm 

166.89 174.37 A: and uh i guess i did want to ask a question of you lou to see what your opinion is my wife and i um 

174.93 178.82 A: have discussed this before and we felt like uh 

179.03 183.60 A: you know despite the moral flaws that he had uh 

183.87 192.54 A: we felt uh that bill clinton was a very effective diplomat and a very polished uh public speaker 

192.76 201.71 A: and she told me she said that if clinton were still in office instead of bush that there would be no war in iraq 

201.07 202.36 B: i agree 

202.79 203.35 B: (( [mn] )) 

203.64 215.77 B: someone else says well what else was he supposed to do when the world trade center was uh was hit and then i i i had this thought that came to me just from all the situations that had 

216.42 227.29 B: would he the world trade center have been attacked if he wasn't elected when you stop to think that the most hated person by the moslem community was his father 

226.94 228.30 A: right 

227.65 240.72 B: and the sins of the father follow the son according to the moslem beliefs so therefore it was not long after he was elected and everyone knows that the plan was developed something like five years ago 

231.78 232.71 A: mhm 

240.54 242.34 A: mhm 

241.28 242.35 B: so 

242.45 249.67 B: you know they could have enacted it at any time but they chose after george bush was elected to do it now if 

248.58 249.39 A: right 

250.12 256.58 B: uh you know i like i say i'm a democrat but i would have voted for mccain if he would have ran 

256.27 257.73 A: mhm 

257.28 271.63 B: because i think he was a good honest moral person plus he could think on his feet and talk like you say [laughter] has the ability he has some polish and he has you know communication skills uh i i um 

268.31 269.55 A: mhm 

272.31 282.29 B: al gore's not my favorite person in the world but if you put the two men together and you put george bush and al gore one uh next to one another 

282.09 289.06 B: you look at 'em and you say who's the most intelligent who can speak the best who has the most connection who is best with foreign affairs who is 

288.83 299.34 B: economically more suited for the position because he knows about economics who's the one that can environmentally more versed in the situation in the world plus the internet and everything else 

298.83 299.79 A: mhm 

299.17 311.95 B: and then you look at george bush what experience does he have he was an average student uh at at harvard which i heard that he uh normally his grade average wouldn't have got uh let anyone else in but since his 

312.30 320.09 B: father was a member of the uh um what is it the the the skulls and bones or whatever it is 

319.49 320.57 A: mhm 

320.16 333.34 B: uh and so is he that he got in now it's just oh the situation today would be a lot different i know five years ago financially i was much better off than i am today 

333.01 333.91 A: yes 

334.11 339.90 B: so you know why who do i think who's a better president well you know i look at my pocket book 

339.29 341.08 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

341.37 346.17 B: i think the and the american public i would think are the same way 

346.13 347.00 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

346.85 353.31 B: now you're from louisiana but i i realize and i could never figure this out until somebody told me this 

351.95 353.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

353.35 358.07 B: farming states generally go towards republican views 

357.48 359.39 A: (( mhm )) 

358.50 369.14 B: and i can't figure it because the republican party has never been kind to the farmer and and the house or the senate or any president that's been a republican been kind to the farmer 

369.08 378.61 B: and some republican farmer told me he said it's not their political views it's their moral views that they agree with so they vote the moral view 

379.67 382.11 B: and don't care about economics 

381.75 382.81 A: (( hm )) 

382.54 384.06 B: i i find it 

384.30 398.81 B: [mn] you know well i'm not a very deeply religious person you know i'm a very spiritual person but you know i seem to think that you know you want to feed your family [laughter] the the prime directive of your life uh 

389.07 390.03 A: mhm 

395.51 396.48 A: yes 

398.97 401.19 B: (( yeah but )) 

402.03 404.15 B: interesting topic though 

404.04 405.36 A: yes it is 

404.74 413.01 B: but north korea would be my main uh main concern if i was to be uh asked that question you know in a public forum 

410.45 411.39 A: mhm 

414.44 418.10 A: [noise] yep that would be mine too would be north korea 

417.42 418.91 B: yeah 

418.66 419.74 A: and uh 

421.43 424.16 A: [cough] i have some concerns about china also 

423.54 433.17 B: yeah china's you know they don't care if they go to war what do you kill uh fifty million people in their country or how many million are there in that country 

433.43 435.31 A: [mn] there's no telling 

434.75 440.11 B: there's no telling you know they don't care how many you kill of them i mean it they'll only be better 

437.90 438.77 A: (( yes sir )) 

440.56 441.87 B: (( [laughter] )) 

441.23 442.45 A: and i had uh 

443.00 449.48 A: a friend that was uh she keeps up with political views and she said that she can't uh 

450.22 454.06 A: uh recall if it was china's i think it was china's 

454.09 459.20 A: uh ruler that said this that uh told the united states that if you 

459.27 465.82 A: attack us and we have massive casualties uh we'll just make more citizens 

465.71 473.63 B: mhm yeah and hopefully the you know and they they they don't value the female life at all 

473.24 475.05 A: mhm 

474.38 480.32 B: much as the moslem community doesn't have any respect for the female life you know 

481.41 485.97 B: i don't know this is you know what's the strange thing i have three grandchildren 

486.12 491.57 B: and i think of the world that they're growing up into is worse than the world of my own kids grew up into 

491.26 492.58 A: (( yes [noise] )) 

491.77 494.77 B: and and and you know it's like 

494.73 500.95 B: you want to do something about it and is it too late you know or 

500.84 511.91 B: what can you what can we do and the only thing that you can think about is just try and teach 'em you know some good values to live by you know treat other people the way you want to be treated you know
