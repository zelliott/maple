0.04 1.75 B: hi my name's leander 

1.29 3.09 A: hi my name is burton 

3.13 5.81 B: hi how do you feel about computers in schools [noise] 

3.22 3.96 A: hi 

5.30 19.72 A: well i think they're great my kid [noise] my kid's like a whiz she's always on the internet she emails all her friends and she knows how to work the computer better than me and i have a computer for five years [laughter] you know and she's only nine years old 

15.64 16.78 B: right 

19.32 26.38 B: yeah i i i agree with you i think that computers are very useful i'm a teacher and i can see how the kids can go do um 

26.73 30.21 B: studying other countries [noise] while they're sitting in the classroom 

29.46 44.04 A: [noise] yes and she does she does all her reports you know like she's doing right now she's doing one of ah heritage so she's doing it you know on italy and she's got into all the she got all the images off the computer she did this gigantic thing for her project for school 

37.52 39.28 B: [noise] 

40.39 43.17 B: (( [noise] )) 

43.43 48.99 B: exactly she can visit all the ah towers in italy without ever [noise] actually having to go there the computer 

47.80 51.94 A: and then they give then she can download the pictures right off [noise] 

50.42 53.86 B: exactly [noise] and then get extra credit [laughter] [noise] 

52.25 53.77 A: yeah [laughter] 

54.07 62.39 A: plus you know i dunno then ah and the they just built the my daughter's in a brand new school and they have a computer in every classroom 

58.01 58.89 B: [noise] 

61.07 62.88 B: [noise] right 

62.44 65.42 A: you know they have little they have ah laptops 

64.22 66.08 B: [noise] 

65.51 74.03 A: like i mean they have three like there's real small classes which i think it's unfair but she's in one of the small classes so it doesn't really make a difference 

66.93 68.50 B: [noise] 

71.84 72.41 B: [noise] 

73.14 77.12 B: so she gets to use it a lot as opposed to the other kids who don't get to use it a lot 

74.47 78.61 A: she gets right then the so the other kids that just go down to the lab 

78.04 90.13 B: see my only concern with computers too is that a lot of people are requiring um their kids to write reports with the computers these days and i know some of the parents write the reports for them since it's not in the kids' handwriting 

90.37 93.48 A: oh okay the kid just print it out well not 

91.93 95.38 B: [noise] exactly and you have the kid printing it out and 

95.39 97.97 A: my my daughter's smarter than me kills me 

97.39 101.78 B: [laughter] so i guess her computer skills far exceed yours 

100.91 107.74 A: well no well i mean not really but i mean in spelling you know i check i use spell check all the time she doesn't need to mm 

106.90 112.37 B: well that's the good thing about ah the computers too is that they can check their spelling before they turn something in 

111.47 121.15 A: you turn something in but you know when i was a kid what we used to do is we used to write letters to each other and have conversations that way you know that's how i got better in spelling 

117.68 118.73 B: right 

120.52 124.07 B: exactly that's one of the problems with the computers too is that you don't 

121.25 121.94 A: (( nah )) 

122.66 128.82 A: [noise] [noise] no she emails her cousin she i my cousin her cousins live out of state 

128.18 129.86 B: oh that's nice too 

128.64 138.90 A: and she talks to them [noise] all the time and she she didn't learn that in sch- how to do that in school i mean i wouldn't bother teaching her how to do all that stuff 

130.59 131.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

135.83 137.37 B: she wouldn't be able to do it 

138.33 140.96 B: exactly that's true so i guess they ah 

140.67 150.40 A: that's the other plus thing about it because you know there's like i come home from work and and i go on the computer to finish instead of going to the office i come to the house and use my house computer 

149.80 151.16 B: right 

150.52 154.42 A: and so i don't have to go back to the office after being in the field all day 

153.89 155.54 B: exactly 

154.93 162.54 A: and i don't really want to show her all my well all of the things i need to to show her my wife does but she has more time than i do 

159.70 160.70 B: right 

162.11 163.06 B: right 

162.70 163.91 A: but ah 

164.69 170.84 A: [noise] i mean you know it's great that she can do it in school i mean they're in her classrooms and at my daughter's school they did this 

171.40 172.69 B: (( exactly )) 

171.98 176.95 A: you know they did it in all most all the classrooms from the third grade up 

176.36 179.45 B: [noise] that's great because when i was in school we didn't have computers 

178.35 190.02 A: and we didn't have a science room forget about computers [laughter] you know i had a i had a science room that had a one burner you know all these guys have ah a a a a science lab with all computers everywhere 

180.00 182.04 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] exactly )) 

185.18 186.33 B: right 

189.33 193.80 B: exactly now they can look up everything they ever wanted to know about their science experiments 

191.87 197.10 A: yeah they don't have to right and they don't have to do dissections real animals they can use a simulation 

196.86 203.34 B: now what if what if they required you to buy her a laptop for school would you do it yeah you think it's that worth it 

200.79 201.97 A: (( sure )) 

202.70 207.75 A: yeah i would do that my wife has one anyway so she wouldn't have to buy one she could just borrow it [laughter] 

206.50 208.26 B: she could just use your wife's 

208.36 209.28 B: see i'm a 

208.44 213.79 A: 'cause we we have three so i mean we have three com- two com- two towers and a laptop 

213.24 215.00 B: oh so then you're more than 

214.64 215.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

215.23 218.82 B: equipped to [laughter] handle if she had to start bringing the computer to school 

218.35 223.86 A: yeah because the whole thing is i bought i have an old the the first one we bought that we out grew 

223.95 225.66 A: but the kids still use it 

225.22 226.25 B: right 

226.00 228.99 A: 'cause they haven't out growed it we took all our stuff out of it 

229.15 232.99 A: and it's their computer and she has internet access with that 

232.54 237.24 B: now does she ever do where the teacher has them talk to kids [noise] in other countries over the computer 

236.85 243.70 A: well she talks to well i don- not out of the country nah she doesn't do that and my cousins in italy don't have computers 

243.13 245.44 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

243.67 254.63 A: [laughter] i guess you know you know it's you know which we talk she talks to her cousins in florida and california and new mexico 

246.88 249.87 B: but see if they had computers then she could talk to them [laughter] 

252.72 253.79 B: right 

254.30 255.28 B: (( right )) 

254.92 259.18 A: so i mean she she talks to to different parts of the country but not not overseas 

258.09 259.86 B: but not out of the country 

259.45 260.38 A: no 

260.56 265.93 B: yeah yeah yeah i'm looking forward to my kids being able to use the computers and 

261.14 262.04 A: yeah 

264.65 273.24 A: well like you know you know oh sh- that was the funniest thing was when we bought the computer they had this came out with that that big round mouse ball for little babies 

272.73 274.54 B: oh 

273.75 277.57 A: so you know my kim- all three of my kids are pretty smart with the computer 

277.30 278.69 B: that's good 

278.00 281.70 A: you know so i mean they fight over we're gonna have to buy a fourth one 

279.74 280.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

281.10 285.46 B: [laughter] and you said they start computers at your daughter's school at third grade

317.31 318.88 B: wow [noise] 

317.87 321.29 A: and from the first grade they go to the lab 

320.67 324.21 B: do the teachers have a website for their classroom on the 

323.61 325.33 A: i'm assuming they do 

324.84 330.11 B: yeah because that would be cool if you could go and see like how your your daughter's grades are and stuff

391.00 392.74 B: [noise] [laughter] 

392.19 396.67 A: my company paid us to go to go back to school for ah computers 

395.24 395.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

396.08 399.87 B: oh wow well that's good that tells you how important they are 

397.33 398.49 A: (( yeah )) 

399.53 408.87 A: yeah well that's the whole thing is you know i'm i'm don't have to guess any more i can just get online and and and 'cause architects don't like to give answers 

400.94 401.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

403.27 404.22 B: right 

408.36 409.56 B: right 

409.27 412.73 A: because they don't want to be blamed for anything [laughter] [noise] 

410.71 416.56 B: right well then i guess it's good then that they're starting with the kids so young and so that when they graduate [noise] 

415.98 422.11 A: well yeah well that's that's the whole thing is when they graduate they they the computers are going to be taking over the world so 

421.33 424.01 B: exactly well hopefully not taking over but 

424.05 425.23 A: they will 

424.69 426.10 B: [laughter] 

425.56 435.02 A: come on i'm in new york they're they're firing ah they're firing the the transit workers in the token booths they have the the computerizing machines clicking our metro cards 

434.49 437.79 B: oh really they're gonna start using the computers for that instead of people 

437.21 438.38 A: yes 

437.80 440.13 B: oh that's cold [laughter] 

438.89 446.22 A: so i mean you know but the whole thing is it's not like they haven't done it before the path train's been here for thirty years and they've never had tolls 

444.58 445.53 B: right 

445.69 446.92 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

446.32 456.36 A: and washington if you go on the red line they don't have they don't have tolls either you buy a machine from the token a ticket from a machine and and it gives you your ticket you 

454.36 455.35 B: right 

456.09 457.03 B: huh 

456.62 468.51 A: know they have video cameras so you can't sneak on the train [laughter] well actually in in washington they have a conductors in new jersey they don't have conductors that's why they have they have cameras everywhere 

459.66 460.78 B: [laughter] 

465.38 466.81 B: oh 

467.93 469.76 B: oh well cameras are good 

469.26 474.92 A: yeah i guess so well i don't know you see i i think that's gonna be bad see i really don't think 

473.36 476.22 B: [laughter] in some instances yes [laughter] 

475.03 477.86 A: yeah i really don't i don't really like cameras 

477.31 480.37 B: [laughter] it depends on what you're doing when the camera's watching 

479.87 484.77 A: no i don't even think it's that i don't think anybody should have to i mean and even in classrooms 

484.16 485.25 B: right 

484.82 490.54 A: you know because they they take you and they say here you bucket you did it you have no you have no way out 

490.12 495.51 B: right well that could be kinda good though for kids in school especially with some of the way kids act these days 

495.06 496.46 A: well 

495.92 499.16 B: and parents don't believe 'em say here i got it on tape 

497.53 498.44 A: (( well you )) 

498.91 505.83 A: yeah i know well i i know because i was a pretty bright kid but you know my mother always believed the teacher never believed me so 

499.53 500.77 B: [laughter] 

503.06 504.13 B: [laughter] 

505.22 509.48 B: well that's that's the way you're supposed to go you always supposed to believe the teacher never the kid [laughter] 

508.86 511.78 A: yeah well it's what you know you're you're taught that way 

511.26 513.77 B: (( [laughter] ))

524.60 525.89 B: the um 

525.52 530.48 A: [laughter] see that's the other thing bad [laughter] they they can email you 

528.97 531.38 B: computers can find you anywhere you go 

530.53 532.09 A: yeah anywhere you go 

531.64 533.81 B: [laughter] 

532.41 535.45 A: (( you know but you know that's the world now )) 

535.16 539.75 B: do you think though that your daughter would ever use the computer in the classroom for things she's not supposed to 

539.31 542.70 A: no she doesn't she's not that type of child 

539.91 540.70 B: no 

542.05 544.18 B: because that's what i wonder too is how many 

543.26 549.16 A: well see the whole thing is you in in the schools you can't get access to stuff like that you know the the whole thing is 

546.81 548.23 B: that's true too 

548.26 551.31 B: although unless you're a really smart kid because there are some kids that 

550.35 555.55 A: so you you you can hack your way though all that stuff well you know what that's not true because 

552.03 553.68 B: (( exactly )) 

553.81 556.29 B: that they're chatting on the i. d. 

555.56 565.06 A: because the whole thing is nowadays ah you have only what you go on on account on cer- on school things only they only let you onto certain part of the web 

560.74 561.84 B: [noise] 

562.11 563.27 B: right 

564.70 565.66 B: right 

565.43 570.21 A: so they acc- well that's the whole thing good about it all the other ones aren't so good 

569.61 575.08 B: right do the teachers stand over her when she or do they have a computer where they can see what she's doing 

572.37 573.27 A: no 

574.34 579.65 A: no because she has one on her desk so there you know so [laughter] 

576.15 578.12 B: oh okay okay 

578.79 581.50 B: so she could be she could be writing whatever she wants 

580.84 587.48 A: she could do whatever she wants on the computer but the whole thing is but the whole thing is i know they can they can check everything that comes on her computer 

582.68 584.18 B: does she have to link her 

586.91 588.33 B: yeah 

587.66 589.25 A: you know just like i can 

588.87 595.27 B: right do they do they link their computer up to the kids so they know like what the kids are doing at all time or are they not linked up or 

594.68 598.79 A: (( well yes and no because the whole thing is how do you monitor ))
