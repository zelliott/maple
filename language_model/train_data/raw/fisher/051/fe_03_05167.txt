88.24 88.89 B: [noise] 

88.65 99.04 A: well see now apparently it's not really that big of a scandal compared to like enron or something she didn't really like [mn] wipe out people's retirement and stuff so 

98.21 99.49 B: [sigh] it's true [sigh] 

99.26 103.59 A: i think it's hard to define what a scandal is nowadays because there've been some major 

103.71 104.88 B: (( yeah [sigh] [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

103.89 111.74 A: major problems and um you know she's like an individual they're trying to make a- an example out of her or something i think they're kind of 

111.75 113.96 A: coming down hard on one person 

114.00 126.88 B: i think so too i mean i i i i honestly i like martha stewart [laughter] and i watch her almost [laughter] almost every day because of what's yeah it's what's on in the morning [sigh] that's my ah t- t- t- the morning is my evening [noise] so [sigh] 

119.79 120.60 A: yeah 

122.78 123.68 A: oh yeah 

126.25 132.58 A: i never really got into her and the only other thing i've seen her was when she used to be on dave letterman's show late at night 'cause i'm ah 

132.80 143.13 A: i'm able to see that schedule [sigh] i haven't seen her on there for a while but anyway i kind of know w- who she is and what her show is and all that kind of stuff she's trying to help out with kmart and 

134.67 136.47 B: yeah 

139.40 140.74 B: (( yeah [sigh] [sigh] )) 

143.33 146.02 A: you know i just don't see what the major 

146.18 148.31 A: problem is i don't think it's 

148.32 157.25 A: real clear or provable i think they're trying to get her to plead or cop a plea or p- plea bargain or [sigh] i don't know what they're trying to do 

155.42 157.14 B: yeah 

157.67 161.25 A: but she's not a corporation i mean she is incorporated and she's 

160.03 162.98 B: [sigh] yeah you're right 

161.40 164.11 A: a big ah big shot and a rich person 

164.21 167.19 A: but that's not a corporation as 

167.57 169.03 A: we know it 

168.83 177.54 B: [noise] [sigh] so [noise] here's a deal [noise] ah here's a deal [noise] bush had president bush had a brick load of stock in enron 

169.52 170.56 A: you know 

174.61 175.56 A: yeah 

176.88 178.73 A: (( yes definitely )) 

177.58 182.11 B: and right before and right before enron went under he sold it 

180.62 181.50 A: yes 

181.69 185.15 A: right because he got the hands up from the smart guys 

184.95 186.51 B: yeah 

185.24 189.39 A: who were only giving up the information to their circle of friends 

188.58 189.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

188.90 198.40 B: yeah and and listen and when and when bush was asked about it [sigh] like like he i i don't i think it's like k- ken was l- like the h- head guy 

192.27 193.15 A: yeah 

198.30 205.99 B: [sigh] he's like he's like ken ken who [sigh] and t- this guy al- like almost like supported a 

199.13 200.62 A: mm 

201.72 204.97 A: mm 

206.01 216.50 B: like alone bush's campaign like like [sigh] ha- like half of bush's campaign came from [sigh] from en- like enron and companies like enron [sigh] 

209.11 210.58 A: mm 

217.37 218.94 B: it's 'cause of taxes 

217.85 220.67 A: well wait a minute wait a minute where did you get that fact 

220.90 222.99 B: (( [sigh] um yeah )) 

221.83 225.80 A: half of his campaign came from enron or something like enron 

223.38 225.68 B: yeah yeah yeah um 

227.20 231.41 B: ah jeeze i found that that information on the internet several places ah 

230.86 233.89 A: okay i'm saying you know it could be true i just 

231.71 233.11 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

233.63 235.39 B: yeah 

233.95 237.13 A: i'm it's just natural for me to say well you know how do you know 

236.05 244.33 B: a- yeah and yeah and and me too an and when and whenever i hear that i i always go look for a second source s- something like you know 

239.10 239.92 A: [noise] 

244.21 250.25 A: that well that could be 'cause there's way too much money ah being spent in in politics for sure 

244.39 245.13 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

250.39 251.86 B: yeah [sigh] 

250.97 251.93 A: but 

252.33 258.22 A: [noise] i don't know [sigh] i was thinking yet and still ah and regardless of all that if you want to get into the 

258.50 262.36 A: presidential politics a little bit off of the corporation thing it's like 

262.74 271.21 A: um al gore never had any fun in the first place and he was like stuck in the s- senate thing because his dad was a senator 

271.22 279.01 A: whereas george bush got out of t that racket that his dad was doing [sigh] but then came back to it on his own like a billy graham's son 

279.23 285.91 A: so it's kind of two different things al gore never had a break [sigh] and he was like totally burned out and fried and [sigh] 

279.47 280.03 B: (( [sigh] )) 

286.14 290.90 A: i'm thinking that it actually worked out because [sigh] i don't think he could have handled it 

290.42 290.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

291.02 293.54 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] hm yeah [sigh] a- ah )) 

291.74 295.09 A: especially seeing as what's happened the past couple of years 

295.05 297.31 B: [noise] you know [sigh] you know 

295.75 297.14 A: but i don't know 

297.36 309.25 B: it it's it's so hard to say too ah like like ah like as soon as nine eleven happened i was like oh my gosh gore could have never handled something like this i thought bush handled [sigh] the american public ah 

300.00 300.88 A: yeah 

308.02 312.76 A: well who yeah who would want that job i mean jeeze that's no fun 

310.75 311.62 B: yeah 

311.66 315.52 B: bush handled the american public amazingly i mean he was on 

314.71 316.05 A: i thought pretty well 

315.94 319.09 B: yeah h- he was in my good books at that point [noise] [cough] [noise] [laughter] [noise] 

317.65 324.22 A: he did but it but it's about the corporations and where and the behavior and whether there's scandal whether there's 

324.63 330.76 A: ah illegality and so on i don't know scandal to i think the word scandal is talking about 

331.44 332.92 A: you know things that 

333.43 334.80 A: (( that ah )) 

335.23 337.57 A: don't look right or they 

337.65 343.12 A: you know t- they're evil they're it it's more of an opinion kind of word [sigh] whereas actually breaking the law 

341.39 343.29 B: (( [sigh] uh-hum )) 

343.20 355.51 A: or or um or hurting someone is is not the same thing [sigh] i think the martha stewart thing is a scandal but i don't think there's any [sigh] real harm or i'm not even sure a law was broken 

344.70 346.66 B: yeah 

355.56 357.47 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

355.78 360.67 A: but there is a case there at least and they're probably getting all the attorneys are going to make money off it [noise] 

360.27 367.03 B: it's it's hard to believe that you know these people go to t- the same prison that you know a murderer goes to [sigh] 

367.29 370.13 B: like like i understand 

368.08 379.09 A: yeah they don't that's true they don't [laughter] it's actually true it's like the watergate thing that was a scandal [sigh] the the laws were kind of it wasn't that big a deal but it was the intention 

370.76 372.44 B: yeah 

373.30 374.50 B: (( yeah [sigh] [laughter] )) 

379.20 390.02 A: that finally hung him and it was the cover up that became a scandal it's just like with the [sigh] clinton thing it's like so what you know getting a b._j. under the desk whatever but it's the fact that he was lying under oath 

390.21 391.72 B: yeah 

390.37 392.33 A: that that was the real problem 

391.81 394.14 B: [laughter] they and 

392.54 397.89 A: and like you say it wasn't even whether enron was screwing around with other people's money 

397.74 408.61 A: you know not being a good ah custodian of someone's ah stock premiums and [sigh] or whatever they're you know investments were [sigh] it's just that they were lying about it like you say one story for the 

408.37 413.02 A: insiders and republicans another story for you know [sigh] joe six pack 

411.75 413.38 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

413.76 416.55 A: that's that's what stinks about stuff like that 

414.10 414.66 B: (( [sigh] )) 

415.98 423.42 B: [noise] yeah and i guess that they were over charging um states too ah i guess i i [noise] 

421.74 425.24 A: [noise] now you're getting into what i wanted to talk about now look at boeing 

425.99 435.57 A: okay look at boeing out here okay it was like the major corporation it is the engine that made the development of the north west of seattle okay 

435.10 437.24 B: (( [noise] y- yeah [noise] )) 

436.42 441.39 A: you know big big bucks in making and selling airplanes you know the 

440.08 442.58 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

441.62 451.16 A: airplanes you can make 'em more bigger bigger money every year each each one became more expensive and a whole batch of 'em was like major major deal [sigh] but a 

444.56 445.12 B: (( [noise] )) 

449.51 453.66 B: (( uh-hum )) 

452.17 454.57 A: couple of days i mean it was like 

454.07 454.73 B: (( [noise] )) 

455.20 457.89 A: only a few days after nine eleven 

456.25 459.48 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah ))

478.88 482.41 B: (( hm yeah )) 

479.13 480.33 A: (( you see what i mean )) 

480.75 494.07 A: [noise] plus the stupid way he announced it like that all that did was push the stock down worse [sigh] and the stock again was part of the retirement package [sigh] whether it was on time retirement or whether it was early retirement because of the downturn 

489.68 490.57 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

493.38 495.34 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

494.61 498.71 A: you know so that was really bad and now basically they've closed down 

499.03 501.36 A: in boulders i mean they completely 

501.78 514.56 A: ah just removed entire installations here so it's not coming back like it used to [sigh] they used to you know too many people not enough people too many people not enough people like that [noise] but now it's like it's gone it's over 

512.61 515.86 B: (( yeah [noise] huh )) 

515.42 517.34 A: that to me is a scandal 

517.63 521.81 A: and that hurts me even though i don't have any direct connection 'cause 

521.89 524.10 A: it depresses the whole area here 

524.26 526.41 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] and the economy )) 

525.98 537.54 A: [noise] yeah and then you know you could take it a step further you could racial about it [sigh] and say because our governor is chinese american [sigh] he was the one that took the boeing jobs [sigh] and cut the deals to ah 

526.98 528.74 B: yeah 

537.35 545.14 A: basically export the jobs to china [sigh] 'cause they're they're making all half the a- airplane crap over there in china now and stuff like that 

543.44 549.63 B: [noise] labor's cheap there i i was just talking with a coworker about that [sigh] i work at the at 

547.29 552.65 A: it's some something smells funny about it you know but you can't really call it 

552.78 558.60 A: you know illegal but there but you could definitely put that word scandal on it because it doesn't smell right 

558.90 565.28 A: it's like whenever you think of the you know boeing or gary lock around here [sigh] you're always going to kind of wonder you know 

565.56 570.12 A: [mn] was somebody you know really ah paying somebody off or what 

569.96 581.97 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum uh-hum [noise] [sigh] and that's how they make their money though [laughter] you know a it's it's it's hard to be a good businessman [sigh] be because [noise] 

579.21 580.45 A: exactly 

580.57 587.61 A: because there's got to be politics in it you try to just have the best product at the best price [sigh] and do good business 

585.25 587.06 B: (( yep yep [noise] )) 

587.43 598.66 A: [sigh] but they're apparently you can't do business in a big way any more [sigh] without getting involved in some scandal even if you didn't try to in the first place it kind of comes to you i think 

593.64 594.29 B: [noise] 

597.18 599.95 B: (( uh-hum [noise] ))
