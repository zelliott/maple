0.17 2.37 B: hi my n- hello 

0.30 1.41 A: hello 

2.39 4.18 B: my name's br- i'm bruno 

2.41 3.68 A: how you doing 

4.11 5.97 A: hi bruno i'm andy 

5.34 6.80 B: hi andy 

6.46 7.41 A: how are you 

7.13 10.77 B: i'm pretty good i've sort of forgotten what the question was already 

10.90 12.07 B: um 

11.08 12.02 A: (( yeah i )) 

12.03 15.96 A: um think it was uh do you have a lot of 

14.30 16.86 B: oh it was a lot of friends or a few good friends 

16.38 17.68 A: yeah 

17.58 24.01 B: right um well i'll start uh i'm the type of person who has uh very few good friends 

23.94 25.02 A: mhm 

24.08 28.35 B: and a whole lot of people who are uh acquaintance 

28.24 29.92 A: mhm 

30.17 35.68 A: um [lipsmack] i i used to be the person i think who would have a lot of friends and i'm 

36.12 42.08 A: quickly moving towards uh being the type of person who has very few good friends just 

41.05 42.50 B: why do you think that changed 

42.24 52.62 A: well i um [lipsmack] just recently got engaged and i've been spending much more time with just one person [laughter] so uh yeah 

50.06 51.51 B: that'll do it 

51.71 61.81 B: yeah i've been married and i think that's where i transitioned uh out of having a lot of friends but then that didn't work out and sort of transitioning back into lots of friends is a little more difficult 

54.83 55.90 A: yeah 

62.30 63.18 B: so 

62.42 64.93 A: [lipsmack] oh i'm sorry what didn't work out 

64.35 71.05 B: well the marriage didn't work out so well getting out of that you know you sort of think well i'm going to have lots and lots and lots of friends again and i think uh 

65.81 66.88 A: oh really 

70.07 71.36 A: yeah 

71.26 74.70 B: you know i think part of it also is you get a little older and it's 

74.95 84.12 B: well we might be much more forgiving in what we're willing to accept in our closest friends we're not necessarily willing to put up with a lot of stuff from people we barely know 

84.15 85.02 A: yeah 

84.29 88.08 B: so for me that that sort of narrows the field pretty quickly 

85.16 86.36 A: yeah 

87.58 93.08 A: so it's harder for you to transition back into the lots of friends sort of 

92.42 96.34 B: well it's that and lack of time i think too 

95.09 96.94 A: yeah yeah 

96.41 99.29 B: um i work in the theatre so i meet 

99.98 105.35 B: uh a lot of people uh i meet more than your average amount of people 

100.29 101.57 A: a lot of people 

102.02 103.00 A: yeah 

105.51 117.96 B: uh on a you know sort of monthly basis but that's sad it's sort of transition it's in work you know in between that and hobbies and other sort of work 

108.20 109.45 A: mhm 

118.05 120.47 B: you have very little time and so you know 

120.45 123.47 A: your your time is opened up more though now that you're 

120.64 121.43 B: (( m- )) 

123.55 125.03 A: you're not married anymore 

123.84 126.75 B: well yes and no yes and no um 

127.02 131.82 B: yes it opens up more oh well it's certainly more open than i think what you know the phase you're going into 

131.58 132.56 A: yeah 

131.93 135.51 B: um well do do you and your fiancee share friends 

135.82 139.89 A: [lipsmack] uh yeah we uh sh- well a few friends we share yeah 

139.50 143.50 B: 'cause that's now that's that helps you know uh 

141.99 143.99 A: right right 

143.63 149.03 B: the most rel- recent relationship i was in we we could not make our friends merge 

148.71 149.80 A: uh-huh 

149.50 157.82 B: which uh uh meant that neither of us had as many friends during the relationship as uh that we wanted so 

157.91 160.44 B: i think that's uh that's part of the thing 

159.12 162.77 A: you didn't have as i'm sorry you didn't have as many friends as you wanted 

162.67 164.96 B: during the uh during the relationship 

165.15 169.01 B: well because you spend you've got the time you spend with each other and then 

167.99 170.03 A: you ha- you've limited time yeah 

169.38 176.18 B: yeah exactly but then you know some of her friends were not j- were not in the same world as some of my friends and so that sort of 

170.10 170.93 A: yeah 

174.72 175.93 A: yeah 

176.26 178.01 B: narrows it down a little bit too 

177.77 182.81 A: yeah and that that sort of causes you to really have to pick you sort of pick your friends really 

182.80 184.50 B: [noise] yeah exactly 

182.94 185.40 A: because you're only yeah 

185.01 193.04 B: exactly you have like your friends with the person you're with or and then the friends who you sort of hide away for a special day um 

189.52 190.83 A: yeah 

192.24 193.44 A: yeah 

193.49 197.28 B: so that's a little different but i know 

195.45 198.79 A: yeah when did you get split up 

199.06 204.49 B: uh well i was married years ago um but the other relationship is relatively recently 

201.03 202.09 A: oh okay 

204.31 205.45 A: mhm 

204.94 206.71 B: (( so um )) 

206.80 211.58 B: but you know you've you it it's i think uh it helps focus who the good friends are 

211.69 213.26 A: yeah totally 

211.81 212.54 B: (( [noise] )) 

213.31 215.18 B: for good for better or worse [noise] 

214.73 216.43 A: yeah 

215.40 217.21 B: but 

217.84 226.63 B: i mean for instance one of my very good friends just called me today to say that he's getting romantically involved with my ex girlfriend [laughter] so you figure well okay 

223.13 225.62 A: [lipsmack] oh well [laughter] 

226.46 234.62 B: all right b- you know he did that because he's the good friend as opposed to obviously she should have said something but i mean granted it's been a long time but still 

226.54 227.47 A: yeah 

229.88 231.11 A: yeah 

232.80 233.86 A: right 

234.49 235.99 A: right 

236.15 239.14 A: 'cause she figured he would tell you eventually right [laughter] 

238.89 243.71 B: no uh yeah i think he figured well she should say something and then when he realised she wasn't going to 

242.04 243.16 A: yeah 

243.57 245.43 A: yeah 

244.54 248.60 B: but um and i think it's things like that where you go well 

249.35 253.59 B: a few good friends do just the right thing and the rest of them you know 

253.63 255.68 B: got enough to do to occupy my time 

255.38 256.99 A: right [laughter] 

256.68 257.24 B: so 

257.34 258.75 A: yeah 

258.30 259.09 B: (( you know )) 

259.27 260.57 B: when are you getting married 

261.00 263.35 A: [lipsmack] uh we're getting married in october 

263.53 264.81 B: oh good for you 

264.37 278.03 A: and uh yeah that was one problem i s- i guess what you know i realised i did have a lot of friends and we couldn't bring that many people to the wedding and i found myself having to pick and choose unfortunately yeah 

273.39 274.17 B: (( mm )) 

277.64 281.64 B: that's an interesting thing about making weddings making wedding plans 

281.06 282.37 A: yeah 

281.89 283.17 B: you have to 

283.42 284.95 B: quantify 

284.93 285.99 A: right 

285.39 287.66 B: you know friends um 

286.10 287.24 A: right 

287.53 288.85 A: and and r- 

287.69 289.84 B: to give to give it a sort of rating system 

289.64 300.58 A: and and sort of categorize like oh if i invite this person that that brings in this whole sub culture of people you know [laughter] you know 'cause if i invite them i have to invite the their friends you know 

295.51 298.31 B: [noise] right exactly [laughter] exactly 

300.82 313.99 B: mhm well i found you know i made just arbitrary choice when i was doing that i think that you know when i was i got married when i was twenty five which was close enough to high school to still have many of those friends and and i uh 

300.94 302.26 A: yeah 

308.98 309.81 A: (( mm )) 

312.01 313.45 A: yeah 

313.80 324.63 B: it just got to a point where i said you know i'm inviting the buddies you know i said i'm not gonna have many many girlfriends and etcetera but the only way i could figure out to narrow it down was to basically say 

316.98 318.08 A: mhm 

324.96 327.68 B: you know if i was having a party in eighth grade 

327.81 338.59 B: who would i have invited [laughter] and sort of went with the people who had been my friends and you know most of those guys who i'd brought there had been uh you know friends for ten or some years so 

329.85 330.66 A: oh 

332.73 333.86 A: (( uh-huh )) 

337.44 341.26 A: friends for a long time yeah and are they still friends of yours 

341.22 342.25 B: yeah some of them 

342.05 342.88 A: yeah 

342.27 344.78 B: some of them are i mean distance is another thing 

344.60 345.64 A: yeah 

345.08 349.42 B: most of my old close friends live in chicago and new york and i'm in l._a. so 

348.83 350.03 A: mhm 

350.62 352.77 B: that kind of uh prevents 

353.31 355.58 B: uh that makes it a lot harder obviously [noise] so 

355.38 356.70 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

357.02 360.12 A: yeah i think definitely as you get older you tend to 

360.13 363.83 A: have less less friends but they get closer obviously 

363.86 370.96 B: yeah exactly the ones to uh [noise] you know but that becomes an interesting question [noise] is making a new good friend 

364.87 365.68 A: yeah 

371.30 381.58 B: when you get to a certain age [noise] you know there's some people i've met recently and there's this little thing inside that goes hey this could be a really good friend but then there's the other part going [sigh] 

379.11 380.08 A: uh-huh 

381.81 387.27 B: what possible time can you possibly put into to even find out you know so 

385.35 388.20 A: yeah yeah 

387.69 389.79 B: (( [noise] you know that sort of an odd [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

389.26 397.10 A: but it's exciting to think that you could you know if they really are an interesting person and you both get along so well it could you know be the beginning of a whole new 

397.18 399.54 A: you know relationship which is cool 

398.91 405.17 B: well that's true too actually [noise] that is uh you know that is definitely very true [noise] 

400.68 401.51 A: yeah 

404.54 405.86 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

406.66 414.06 B: but but i don't know [noise] i don't know is uh the person you are getting married to somebody you've been a close friend with for a long time 

413.14 420.40 A: [lipsmack] you know w- while we've only known each other for about two and a half years so uh but we'd consider each o- each other friends 

417.68 418.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

420.37 422.11 B: [mn] well i hope so [laughter] 

420.61 424.80 A: um yeah yeah um 

423.66 427.05 B: it's sort of the default best friend no matter [noise] how hard you try otherwise 

426.80 429.42 A: yeah um 

430.07 434.97 A: [lipsmack] and i guess there's been a i've had a couple of girlfriends in the past where i've 

435.03 440.17 A: that we've been friends first and then we've become you know more deeper than that 

440.36 443.69 B: oh i keep saying that that's what i should do 

443.14 445.53 A: um uh-huh [laughter] 

443.94 446.35 B: [noise] that never seems to work out that way 

445.66 447.26 A: [laughter] 

446.75 447.85 B: um 

447.92 450.78 B: unfortunately it's i'm too much of the uh 

451.23 457.44 B: [noise] zing bang boom there it is oh my god you know and 

452.63 456.13 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

456.38 460.16 A: i i seem to know quite a few theatre people like that [laughter] 

459.27 464.08 B: yeah no it's true it's it's a bad habit of mine a lot of us you know and then uh [noise] 

460.58 462.37 A: [laughter] 

462.95 463.75 A: yeah 

464.35 466.56 B: you know to take the time to uh i 

466.85 474.26 B: don't know you just sort of [noise] fully committed before you know what the heck you're doing [noise] which has worked out several times very well but other times not so well 

470.09 471.25 A: mhm 

472.71 473.98 A: yeah 

474.05 475.05 A: yeah 

474.95 480.92 B: [lipsmack] you know i wouldn't call the last one not so well but [noise] it depends 

478.38 479.71 A: yeah 

481.11 483.02 A: mhm 

481.18 482.02 B: (( you know ))

488.18 489.14 B: in where 

489.23 493.24 A: uh tiburon is um area just north of san francisco 

493.36 495.39 A: across the bay 

496.03 499.22 A: and you can basically see san francisco from tiburon 

498.63 499.61 B: (( oh )) 

499.43 501.20 A: (( do you know where sausalito is )) 

500.73 501.52 B: yes 

501.32 504.15 A: it's it's basically just right across the 

504.39 510.91 A: uh there's a bay north of san francisco bay called richardson bay so tiburon is just east of sausalito 

511.01 513.85 B: okay yeah i don't really know san francisco very well i keep 

511.31 512.81 A: you can see it [lipsmack] 

513.90 517.13 B: meaning to take a few days and drive up there and uh 

515.85 517.23 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

517.24 518.41 A: (( it's a nice place )) 

517.30 523.89 B: to sort of explore the city i haven't been there since i was a little kid so i'm sure it's a lot different 

520.13 521.94 A: oh yeah 

523.12 524.48 A: yeah 

524.26 525.63 B: and it's a city 

525.75 534.80 A: [noise] yeah yeah and i went to uh school in santa barbara and i made a lot of friends there and a lot of them are in l._a. 'cause obviously a lot of people 

526.16 526.92 B: so 

533.24 534.99 B: (( it mhm )) 

534.82 536.97 A: from l._a. that go to school there so 

537.80 538.92 A: ma- be- 

537.82 540.05 B: are you from california originally 

539.37 545.33 A: actually i'm from upstate new york originally um i've been out here ever since i went to college [lipsmack] 

541.85 542.74 B: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

544.82 547.62 B: do you still have friends from high school 

548.18 561.35 A: a couple yeah in fact i have a really good friend um [lipsmack] from high school and we he would come out here and visit me every couple of years or so and i'd visit him every couple of years in in new york 

561.46 565.85 A: and uh finally he moved out here and the strange thing is we've 

566.12 570.46 A: kind of realising we're growing apart just after he's moved out here i think we've 

568.03 568.77 B: (( mm )) 

570.70 572.83 A: he got remarried and um 

573.42 583.64 A: [lipsmack] we're kind of on different paths now it's kind of ironic you know he lives like [mn] probably about a mile away from me now and we don't really have to see each other that much which is kind of a shame 

576.28 578.08 B: mhm 

582.18 583.91 B: that is that is ironic 

584.18 589.26 B: you know that is the i guess not that unusual my [mn] a friend of mine who i've known 

584.23 585.29 A: yeah 

590.17 597.38 B: [sigh] since nineteen oh we've been friends since nineteen sixty nine you know when we were four years old we he's out here now and and we just can't seem to 

593.41 594.44 A: (( right mm )) 

597.65 599.89 B: find the time but we also don't force it
