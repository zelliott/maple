44.40 50.72 B: well you know i didn't understand was it israel and palestine or was it the war in iraq i didn't 

49.94 51.91 A: i'm not sure i guess we could do either 

51.66 52.91 B: okay 

52.65 54.36 A: uh what did you think of the war 

53.01 57.52 B: and maybe it's just the whole big picture in which ten minutes won't even be won't even hit on it 

57.26 59.92 A: [laughter] yeah you probably need about ten hours for that 

58.96 60.66 B: [laughter] exactly 

62.33 63.01 B: oh 

63.45 65.79 B: well um where do you want to start 

65.90 68.59 A: uh i don't know did you agree with the war 

68.47 69.46 B: pardon 

69.38 71.10 A: did you agree with the war 

70.53 83.66 B: uh you know it it's kind of putting every i think i feel like i being kind of hypocrite because i didn't agree with it but it's hard not to support the troops all those poor kids out there you know fighting and dying 

82.01 82.87 A: yeah 

83.80 86.51 B: but you know if we went in there 

86.34 95.68 B: for to find articles of mass destruction boy he sure did a good job of hiding them because [laughter] there doesn't seem to be any [laughter] and 

92.77 93.68 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

94.64 96.24 A: they haven't come up with anything [cough] 

95.51 102.24 B: if i mean and if we did because he was a despot and a terror- and a you know and um 

102.48 110.47 B: you know held his people in terror you know let's just he can get along with everybody else that we're allowing to rule like that 

103.73 105.39 A: premeditating reasons 

110.92 113.95 A: yeah yeah i agree uh 

112.80 114.53 B: (( and you know )) 

114.85 125.99 B: and if it was to stop terrorism i mean i mean what happened to bin laden and how we were going to hunt him down like a dog until we found him it was like as soon as we thought we couldn't find him well let's go let's go bomb iraq [laughter] you 

125.87 129.13 A: yeah find something else that we can succeed at 

127.93 129.35 B: (( know pardon )) 

129.32 132.23 A: find out something else that we could succeed at 

131.64 140.89 B: yeah ex- exactly and i mean i think every country probably over there supports terrorism to some degree 

140.66 141.56 A: mhm 

140.94 145.38 B: like i think the saudis have been playing both sides against the middle forever 

145.50 156.30 A: yeah i couldn't agree with you more on on that respect i really don't know where they what they're doing over there and i don't know yeah there definitely seems like there's definite links between them and terrorism but 

146.96 148.85 B: (( [laughter] hm )) 

155.73 160.98 B: oh yeah and we're not doing a thing against that they have a pretty repressive regime 

161.24 162.07 A: yeah 

161.27 162.23 B: um 

162.40 163.16 A: sure 

162.41 167.13 B: you know you don't dare leave the house i mean male or female or at least 

167.12 178.37 B: so it doesn't seem to make any sense why them except in just been kinda bugging everybody for years and maybe they thought well we'll show you what we did to him we can do it to you too 

172.93 173.96 A: yeah 

178.50 180.23 A: try to set an example sort of 

179.79 181.59 B: y- yeah exactly 

181.62 182.82 B: exactly 

181.77 193.55 A: yeah i remember seeing uh i remember seeing quotes in the paper from um people in other middle eastern countries saying that that saddam was the middle eastern leader to try to stand up to the united states and look what happened to him mhm 

194.21 198.87 B: you know they probably have a point they probably have a point 

199.35 203.34 A: but i mean that's the effect that government was going for i'm not sure 

199.49 200.74 B: yeah 

203.08 207.35 B: yeah well i don't think we made any friends if that's if our point if our 

207.43 219.99 B: goal was to make friends i i don't you know or i mean they think we teed off a lot more people than we [laughter] than we um than we you know pleased or rescued or or whatever 

219.60 224.22 A: [mn] [cough] yeah world opinion has definitely become more anti american even in europe 

223.31 227.28 B: oh oh exactly exactly and 

227.45 237.07 B: it it just seems like we're gonna got in and do it no matter what and i think that there the people i mean i don't think we truly understand their culture i mean 

230.50 231.41 A: yeah 

237.21 244.23 B: the tribal culture the religious culture i mean they've been messing around feuding fighting having alliances 

244.28 246.69 B: for truly centuries 

246.53 248.09 A: yeah yeah 

247.14 250.59 B: and i don't think we truly understand that 

250.74 253.70 B: and we don't really i don't think we really get it 

253.54 257.57 A: yeah it's really it's nothing it's not part of our culture or way of life at all 

257.54 259.67 B: yeah exactly 

258.18 259.70 A: it never really has been 

259.96 265.19 B: right and it's something we totally don't understand and the fact i mean i i think 

265.07 279.73 B: a lot of things they do to survive like you know like like the saudis probably playing both ends against the middle i mean i think they've been doing that for centuries and then we think we're just gonna go in and and send a bunch of you know poor innocent servicemen in there and change it overnight i think we're dreaming 

271.48 272.24 A: mhm 

279.70 283.62 A: yeah i think we're finding out the hard way right now with trying to rebuild iraq i mean 

283.07 284.71 B: oh yeah 

283.94 289.57 A: they still have water and power in a lot of well many parts of the country so from what i've heard 

288.93 293.08 B: oh yeah it seems not it seems not well if you blow up your power grid 

293.12 294.47 A: yeah it takes 

293.57 295.31 B: (( [laughter] )) 

294.74 297.53 A: takes more than you can't just flip a switch and it's back on 

297.20 307.01 B: exactly and you need guys like you know well the the the utilities guys to come out and and and work on that and fix it and there doesn't seem to be anybody like that there 

306.85 312.51 A: yeah they don't have like that people like that here don't want to go there and do that so i guess it's 

311.57 313.80 B: oh yeah 

312.54 320.54 A: army corps of engineers more or less is who it falls upon and there's just not enough of them for there to to be able to deal with that quickly 

319.98 324.53 B: yeah oh exactly it it yeah and and i think they're getting to like 

324.35 337.74 B: life wasn't and i think now they're starting to have a kind of false nostalgia like well maybe things weren't so bad there at least we kind of got a pay check at least we could flush the toilet at least we could you know do this and that 

332.26 333.34 A: yeah we got 

337.48 339.63 A: yeah markets were open they could eat 

339.10 341.92 B: yeah exactly [laughter] exactly 

342.06 347.48 A: but i mean hopefully i mean every thing should work out hopefully in the long run but yeah sure i'm 

347.53 349.74 B: yeah things are looking not great 

349.18 352.76 A: and the people over there don't want to hear about the long run because they're worried about now 

352.37 354.97 B: yeah oh oh exactly 

353.17 359.06 A: where their next pay check's coming from yeah they don't care if five years from now everything will be better they want 

359.57 362.79 A: they want rightly so they want their their life back 

362.83 366.24 B: oh indeed exactly exactly 

366.60 378.89 B: yeah [laughter] what what little of them of what they have left i mean that went from apparently being a very prosperous middle eastern country to now it's almost like a third world state and if you had any money you have left town months ago 

375.77 376.67 A: yeah 

378.74 381.70 A: mhm yeah saddam really sucked up that country 

383.31 387.65 A: but uh [cough] what do you think about iran i mean they're sort of 

388.31 390.03 A: i don't know they seem like a 

390.16 393.71 A: sort of a wild card over there uh just from what i've read 

391.76 402.28 B: [laughter] yeah now i'm gonna date myself i'm in my forties so i can remember when i was your age in college and when we when the hostages were iran 

402.15 403.03 A: mhm 

402.42 407.23 B: and we hated iran with a passion and we gave money to iraq 

407.73 409.11 A: yeah during the war 

408.48 409.21 B: to 

409.22 420.91 B: when they fought i mean because we hated iran so much we supported iraq i mean we we gave them the military might that we have now defeated maybe because we we couldn't imagine and then when stuff came out about 

416.92 417.81 A: mhm 

420.73 431.30 B: um you know saddam hussein um you know uh poisoning the kurds i mean we looked the other way no one said a word so i mean it it's 

428.66 429.91 A: mhm 

432.46 433.34 A: [laughter] 

432.59 439.27 B: [laughter] and now all of a sudden you know we're going in to liberate it and it was like well you know twenty years ago we supported them 

439.14 440.25 A: yeah 

439.70 450.91 B: because we hated iraq so badly there doesn't seem to be you know a a long a long term big picture kind of a thing and maybe you just kind of picked you know as you have to to win a battle you you do 

450.78 451.91 A: mhm 

451.31 464.85 B: i i don't know it it's yeah i mean if you were a cynic and thought it was all about like kind of the military industrial complex and freeing up oil and giving help and enormous clean up contracts i mean it would be you know you could 

452.86 453.88 A: yeah 

465.08 477.00 B: it's almost hard not to be [laughter] just kind of like vietnam was all about the gulf of tonkin you know or whatever you put in oil there i mean it's awfully hard to kind of 

467.12 468.02 A: yeah 

478.31 488.16 B: you know to to to kind of not see that point of view and the fact that we're sending american service people over there to die is the only thing that kind of makes you not want to believe that that we would 

487.98 493.74 B: cold bloodedly do that to to to literally to children to nineteen year olds to eighteen year olds 

492.45 493.27 A: yeah 

493.82 497.13 A: yeah i mean yeah a couple of my friends are over there but 

496.45 497.67 B: oh really 

497.33 501.77 A: thankfully they a couple of my friends out of high school they went right into the uh right into the army but 

502.10 505.14 A: thank fully they were okay i heard from them they're actually back

517.96 521.88 A: oh yeah they definitely were and i was just glad that nothing happened to any of them 

521.31 527.23 B: yeah yeah now were they just on a on a rotation or they never even landed or how did that work 

527.34 532.07 A: uh no they were they were some of the first people over there so they were some of the first people to get out 

531.51 534.34 B: oh okay were they over there a year 

534.86 537.87 A: uh i think it was about uh 

537.91 540.05 A: (( i can't remember i want to say thirteen months but )) 

539.76 540.84 B: oh okay

583.89 588.34 A: yeah i've never even been to a desert [laughter] but um middle east i'm sure it's 

586.03 587.92 B: yeah another 

587.98 592.82 B: another thing that the all the chemical warfare was highly exaggerated
