33.85 34.77 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

35.51 38.33 B: [sigh] give me an example of like an illegal business [sigh] [noise] [noise] 

37.87 47.11 A: [sigh] [sigh] i think that ah th- they are mainly talking [noise] about that enron and ah [sigh] today martha stewart and all of that kind of thing how they are [cough] 

47.25 53.11 A: basically the wall street journal and ah [cough] there are other other things which happen in this ah 

53.02 61.73 A: society all that ah credit card issues and ah [sigh] all [sigh] all slipping of the properties and ah there are a lot of things which 

61.50 73.32 A: [sigh] which have been done in the past illegally and ah people have been trying to [sigh] find out a loop hole [sigh] [cough] in the system [noise] and ah i think that's [sigh] ah [sigh] that's what they're mainly talking about that how 

73.13 83.95 A: how [sigh] what ah what how it's a- affecting us and how [sigh] the government what government can do to to protect that [sigh] or protect the general public from that [sigh] [mn] 

84.81 86.71 A: that [mn] i think that's the topic 

84.93 86.07 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

86.34 88.83 B: did you mention like martha stewart [noise] 

88.90 102.23 A: [sigh] yep martha stewart ah got ah today her case was in the [sigh] in the court and ah she will pr- probably be behind the b- [laughter] bars or [sigh] she will be free but [laughter] finally it's in the court right now 

102.35 104.16 B: (( [sigh] she's behind bars right now )) 

102.69 104.18 A: [sigh] the court of justice [sigh] 

104.39 111.14 A: n- not r- right now b- but now it will be i- it it will be ah it will be in the judicial court that ah they'll 

110.25 111.51 B: oh really [sigh] 

111.31 112.94 A: yep today that ah [sigh] 

111.98 113.04 B: what did 

113.14 114.19 B: she do 

114.28 126.42 A: um she has done the same kind of thing like ah [sigh] not exactly what enron has done but ah the almost the same kind of thing that [sigh] ah d- doing ri- you know illegal thing in the stock business 

126.29 129.03 B: [sigh] [sigh] oh okay yeah i think i heard about that yeah 

128.28 130.11 A: (( [sigh] y- yeah )) 

129.45 133.60 B: [sigh] um [sigh] i'm not so much the politician or ah 

133.70 138.95 B: the e- economics master but ah [sigh] i don't know it's hard to [sigh] it's hard to 

140.01 141.00 B: (( ah )) 

141.50 144.69 B: (( turn around pop up with the treatment ne- neither )) 

145.98 147.27 B: quit ah to 

147.75 149.33 A: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] [noise] )) 

148.09 149.48 B: (( come up with a formula )) 

149.55 152.97 A: uh-hum what i think is basically th- that ah [sigh] 

152.80 164.42 A: ah you know mainly government can do a lot of things regarding that and ah [sigh] once they kind of break into some kind of ring and ah [sigh] ah you know that they kind of put on a ban 

164.18 168.52 A: [sigh] or when they are making all these rules to you know how that ah [sigh] 

168.32 174.05 A: they should be mm p- probably better taught too that people can't find loopholes in the system [sigh] 

173.87 186.97 A: and ah and i think the the legis- legislatures are the people [sigh] who basically make all these laws for the [sigh] for the general public they should be more smarter and ah [sigh] should be more s- smarter than all these criminals 

186.76 190.58 A: [sigh] and all these criminals who are m- more smarter they 

190.48 190.75 A: [sigh] 

190.67 203.75 A: that's how they can find the loophole in the system but ultimately [sigh] you know government or ah government agencies can break through a- and get into the into the into the system and find out who has done wrong 

203.68 213.06 A: [sigh] but ah i think that the basic prevention is that ah l- leave less loopholes in the system that [sigh] people can't find those loopholes and [sigh] 

212.99 221.77 A: kind of cheat the the general public the general public is not ah [sigh] is not you know so smart that they can think through all of these issues 

221.57 229.70 A: [sigh] but on the other hand when all these legislatures and ah p- politicians and all these people who are sitting in congress or [sigh] 

229.49 236.66 A: ah or american think tank they [sigh] they have to probably think it through that ah [sigh] they should be above these 

236.76 245.22 A: ah [sigh] criminals their intelligence should be above these criminals and they should [sigh] close down all these loopholes [sigh] that's what i think [noise] 

243.76 257.21 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mm [cough] you know um these kind of like a certain number of loopholes [sigh] you know they're there um you know they're inherent in the status quo like i'm trying to think of maybe a solution and ah you brought up a good ah you know a good point [noise] 

254.51 255.31 A: (( uh-hum )) 

257.16 269.78 B: you know um trying to um fix the loopholes trying you know trying to get 'em down [sigh] but you know it's going to be difficult you know the only thing i could probably think of is i mean like i'm sure the there's a lot of people 

270.19 277.44 B: um in prison for you know those kind of scandals and stuff [sigh] they should probably go and try to find those [noise] people who um 

271.61 272.44 A: (( uh-hum )) 

277.99 278.83 B: (( [noise] who've [noise] who )) 

279.44 284.36 B: have been convicted for those kind of crimes [sigh] [noise] speak to them [noise] you know spend a 

281.80 282.64 A: uh-hum 

284.34 287.14 B: (( spend a great deal of time with these masterminds [noise] )) 

287.04 296.95 B: try and come you know try and figure them out [sigh] [noise] figure out what they know maybe try and ah maybe make 'em an offer shorten their ah shorten their sentence [noise] 

287.28 288.06 A: (( uh-hum )) 

291.66 292.89 A: (( uh-hum )) 

296.83 306.32 B: shorten how much time [noise] they're supposed to spend [sigh] there in prison [noise] you know ah with a deal ah of helping helping the government out you know because 

306.35 307.29 B: lot of 

307.65 310.55 B: [sigh] criminals are some of the smartest people in the world 

310.56 314.52 A: [mn] [sigh] [sigh] that's that's exactly right and um you know that ah 

311.45 312.46 B: (( [noise] [noise] [cough] [sigh] )) 

313.61 314.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

314.38 322.86 A: ah the people [cough] if you [sigh] if you know a little bit about the computers that ah [sigh] a lot of people who create all these viruses 

321.58 322.52 B: [noise] 

322.64 335.37 A: and once they create these viruses all these big companies they just hire them [sigh] because they know that ah these people have created viruses in the computer [sigh] and they are going to one who is going to make some [sigh] anti virus 

335.17 340.58 A: later on [sigh] so they b- basically hire them [sigh] to make all these anti viruses 

336.34 337.74 B: (( right [noise] )) 

340.62 343.51 A: so basically they hi- are hiring the criminals [sigh] 

343.41 345.19 A: (( who have first started [sigh] )) 

345.12 359.67 A: to to make these viruses and ah you know jam all the systems and the [sigh] and hold up the computer businesses and then all these big companies they just contact them and [sigh] when they figure out that t- these are the people who created the virus [sigh] then they hire them to create the anti virus 

359.69 362.23 B: right that's my suggestion 

360.00 362.06 A: (( [sigh] s- so and )) 

362.18 369.09 A: yeah and in the in the same way [sigh] if you i don't know whether you have w- watched that movie hannibal ah ah 

368.41 370.15 B: [noise] hannibal lector 

369.28 383.31 A: [sigh] yep that's the same thing what ha what happened in that that ah he went back and sh- they went back and they wanted him to figure out who was the [sigh] w- w- who who w- was the who has done the the crime [sigh] the crime 

373.36 374.75 B: (( [sigh] exactly )) 

378.83 379.86 B: right 

382.08 383.63 B: (( fight with fire mm )) 

383.53 385.93 A: yes exactly that's right but ah 

385.94 394.28 A: then then [laughter] lot of criminals will [laughter] will be [sigh] will be [laughter] in the in the congress [laughter] if that's [laughter] what you mean [laughter] 

393.39 407.58 B: yeah well [sigh] i mean i mean not for you know not for ever but i mean for insightful intelligence you know i mean [sigh] sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do in terms of trying to avoid [sigh] illegal um you know actions from ah cons sometimes you got to do that 

396.43 397.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

397.39 398.85 A: yeah 

399.79 401.35 A: (( uh-hum )) 

406.99 421.01 A: [noise] uh-hum that's that's actually correct [sigh] and ah i think the [noise] m- most of t- the things they ca- ah they can do to protect it [noise] is that ah t- they [sigh] they have to b- basically close do- close down all these loopholes [sigh] 

407.53 409.32 B: (( [sigh] o- okay [noise] )) 

421.49 436.37 A: [cough] and if they they find somebody doing that and um i don't know w- ah i i was i heard that on the news today that [sigh] enron case will be on the [sigh] on the court of justice in probably [sigh] a year or so so [sigh] 

436.28 437.16 A: why 

437.21 445.14 A: the ah the justice system is so slow why [sigh] p- people cannot be brought to justice like in in days or in months 

445.24 446.61 A: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] when some )) 

445.33 446.68 B: (( [noise] [noise] [sigh] i think ah )) 

446.93 448.72 B: (( well like i think ah yeah )) 

447.01 448.18 A: (( some scandals )) 

449.54 451.70 A: (( [cough] go ahead )) 

451.13 459.90 B: um as trials and stuff like that unfold you know more more stuff comes to the surface [noise] you can't just go and convict someone so [sigh] you know um 

459.18 461.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] [cough] [noise] )) 

459.71 468.90 B: people generally 'cause ah generally people who commit one crime they've committed another [sigh] so like as the story unfolds it's just not an issue of ah one 

465.29 466.18 A: (( uh-hum )) 

469.21 471.90 B: more come out [sigh] and ah 

470.99 473.64 A: (( uh-hum [sigh] that i can )) 

472.44 478.15 B: so i mean the the [sigh] justice system has never been quick [noise] you know 

477.30 487.43 A: uh-hum [sigh] that's right but that that that's that's what they're trying to that was the topic of the discussion today that they wanted to [sigh] to know what government can do to 

478.27 479.15 B: oh no 

487.24 495.89 A: to protect the general public or what government can do to help it and i think that's one of the thing that ah they should ah probably fasten this ah mm 

489.04 490.06 B: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

496.07 502.14 A: ah process and make it quick and ah if they they see somebody doing something and ah [sigh] 

501.99 505.59 A: they they should ah probably catch it immediately or they 

505.49 519.42 A: [sigh] should brought them to justice quickly because ah otherwise when they have all this time on their hand [sigh] who knows how much money they have shifted it to how many countries or how many [sigh] [noise] places or ah they have ah g- got all this chance to talk to their [sigh] 

519.27 524.04 A: (( ah lawyers and ah figure out a- ah w- w- what loophole they can use [sigh] )) 

523.82 525.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

524.43 531.77 A: so p- p- providing the criminals more time is ah basically [sigh] ah giving them more opportunity to 

531.67 540.75 A: to find more loopholes to get rid of [sigh] the you know all all the the stuff they can basically cheat the the general public and then they can 

540.64 547.95 A: [sigh] they can say okay we've now we all these all these lawyers can find some loophole for them and [sigh] ah they can still be rich [laughter] 

548.14 561.35 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] yeah it's really scary to think that ah you know a lot of these are people ah they're politicians people who have [noise] power in congress and you know the the supreme court etc [sigh] a lot of these people um you know they're [sigh] they're criminals themselves 

554.60 555.42 A: (( uh-hum )) 

561.61 564.90 A: [mn] yeah [laughter] yeah that's [noise] 

561.82 569.68 B: [sigh] they're criminals themselves and you know this whole country's f- founded on a you know t- there's like a nation of gangsters this whole country's founded on people running [noise] 

569.65 580.56 B: you know vast economic pyramid schemes from the ghetto you know [sigh] from the beginning of time [sigh] you know um it should be it should be you know [sigh] um importing money you know 

573.91 574.87 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

575.38 575.94 A: (( [sigh] )) 

579.48 581.61 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum uh-hum )) 

580.86 583.00 B: (( harboring oil [noise] in different companies )) 

582.86 583.80 A: (( uh-hum )) 

583.01 584.00 B: [sigh] you know 

584.31 594.90 B: and then ah you know like the world for example when for you know when someone you know a crime boss gets out of hand what do we do [sigh] we go whack 'em you know i mean that's like with the that's the mentality of this country [noise] you know 

590.50 591.06 A: (( [sigh] )) 

591.38 592.58 A: (( [sigh] uh-hum )) 

594.08 596.18 A: (( [cough] uh-hum uh-hum )) 

595.78 599.59 B: [sigh] so i mean it's kind of it seems like a [sigh]
