34.16 45.35 A: yeah the the situation in the middle east oh wow really i you know i mean myself just personally i think that um that that we need to uh 

36.81 38.38 B: yeah [laughter] 

45.80 51.06 A: have a little more control over what we're doing over there or we need to get out completely [noise] 

49.02 50.28 B: (( mhm )) 

51.47 53.26 A: i mean i think that um 

53.54 55.98 A: you know just myself 

56.08 58.62 A: we're getting hit in in saudi 

58.76 60.91 A: and they're they're supposed to be allies 

61.05 72.81 A: iran's doing what they're doing and i just really think that uh you know we need to tell russia and france to uh just butt out i mean they didn't go with us so they need to stay out of it and we need to either fix it or get out one of the two 

73.31 75.11 B: (( mhm )) 

74.36 75.33 A: and uh 

75.55 77.19 A: i'm not really sure 

77.50 82.06 A: i mean i'm not i'm my problem with it is i'm not sure what what our plans are 

82.39 86.71 B: (( right right i see what you're saying yeah )) 

86.21 91.14 A: i mean i have i i just don't i there's no clear outline 

91.64 95.97 A: i mean have you heard any clear outlines on what exactly we're trying to do over there 

91.88 92.95 B: right 

96.16 100.38 B: um well it depends on which regions they're talking about 

96.24 96.80 A: (( go )) 

100.07 102.85 A: (( ahead [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

100.91 102.07 B: like i 

102.92 107.84 B: um like like if you're talking about israel and palestine then um 

105.66 106.63 A: (( [noise] )) 

108.50 114.76 B: you know the offers this this roadmap that they just drew up recently um 

115.05 118.08 B: and in iraqi there is no 

118.27 119.14 B: plan 

119.44 121.26 B: [noise] and uh 

121.37 126.78 B: you know everywhere else i'm i'm sure any kind of plan would probably just to be um 

127.69 129.15 B: [mn] uh 

130.11 131.23 B: uh 

131.52 134.05 B: imperialism enough and uh 

134.55 136.80 B: just kinda take over the country 

136.90 147.58 A: yeah and they're trying to set up an new government in iraq that's gonna take more than a year more than two years and we're we're we're spending so much money on that and we got rid of the person that's there 

141.77 142.56 B: right 

142.85 143.67 B: right 

147.55 160.82 A: and in my opinion if they let somebody- they already know if they let somebody else like saddam hussein in that does what he does we're just gonna go back over there and take 'em out again so i say we should just pack our bags and leave let them set their own government up and they know better 

148.10 148.90 B: (( right )) 

156.29 157.04 B: right 

160.92 162.52 B: mhm right 

161.39 166.78 A: and the next time you know if they threaten us again or we have that problem we'll just go back and take care of it again 

166.92 172.95 A: i mean i i know we can't go over there a million times but i think they'll be less likely to let another saddam hussein in 

167.10 167.82 B: but 

173.39 178.81 B: i mean like we america put him into power and gave him 

179.05 188.10 B: his weapons [mn] and uh gave him power and and you know the c._i._a. have has been doing this years they never so 

188.32 202.21 B: take out some you know popular government put in somebody who is friendly to the u._s. and then that person that's friendly to the u._s. just turns around and is not [sigh] and then we're like oh well you're not giving us oil so 

202.37 203.76 B: you uh 

203.99 207.03 B: you you have to leave now and 

207.39 212.61 B: uh yeah that's just what they've been doing that's definitely like foreign policy 

210.68 218.55 A: well i we did set up we set up bin laden really i mean as far as you know we gave him the ability to hit us 

215.24 216.90 B: (( yeah right )) 

218.57 219.86 B: right exactly 

218.58 221.40 A: i mean when it gets right down to it 

220.77 222.41 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

221.22 230.85 A: and and you know administrations in the past had chances to take him out and never did and i'm sure it's because they were so tied up in what he was doing and keeping russia out of afghanistan 

225.56 226.69 B: mhm 

230.66 241.24 A: making sure they stayed out and then we got bit by that you know and to me i mean we are in a position where we can tell the middle east you know hey here we'll buy your oil at a sensible price 

230.80 231.68 B: right 

241.26 243.40 A: but we don't need you you need us 

243.46 251.40 A: and us just pull completely out of there and you know if if israel and palestine want to blow each other to kingdom come let 'em do it 

250.98 251.79 B: uh-huh 

251.30 260.34 A: because i you know and i'm not anti semitic or anything like that but my point is we have to take care of our own house first 

259.69 263.58 B: right right right definitely we definitely should not be like 

261.43 262.53 A: you know 

263.72 265.88 B: in in their business 

265.45 271.40 A: right and and most of this country's abilities to hit us anyway are are so minimal 

271.36 272.32 B: right 

271.88 282.26 A: and i don't i don't see where the the cost you know the end just doesn't justify the means to me and the cost y- you can't justify the cost that it's taken us to take care of that 

282.27 285.31 A: with uh you know and in this day and age 

285.74 289.30 A: every countr- very country's susceptible to terrorism now 

289.24 290.00 B: right 

289.34 294.23 A: we we realize that so if we back up and take care of our own 

291.03 291.86 B: yeah 

294.99 302.08 A: you know and let our own come before us they'll either come with us or they'll starve because we are the only super power 

300.03 301.07 B: right 

302.24 303.01 B: right 

303.12 312.34 A: and i think that i i think that we need i mean to me uh the smartest thing to do is just to back out of there bring everybody home and let them deal with it themselves 

312.45 313.34 B: right 

312.46 318.59 A: you know and if iran is developing nuclear then we what we need to do is develop a defence against it 

319.03 319.84 B: uh-huh 

319.09 324.94 A: to me that's the smartest thing if we take all all these dimes and dollars that we're spending trying to keep 'em from hitting us 

324.99 327.64 A: and turn around and invest in the system 

327.79 333.38 A: that would [noise] you know whether it was uh [noise] reviving star wars or whatever it would take 

333.50 337.20 A: to keep them from being able to hit us that that's way more effective 

333.59 334.74 B: (( mhm )) 

337.01 340.12 B: right i i i think i think more 

340.28 350.71 B: than that i think uh putting money uh away from more defence and put more into you know into negotiations with people and uh [lipsmack] 

341.56 342.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

343.67 344.81 A: [noise] 

348.16 350.28 A: [noise] 

351.36 358.49 B: uh you know i i i don't think there's any problem with the with the u._n. um helping resolve issues 

351.49 353.37 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

358.63 362.57 B: anywhere uh or if if this system was put in 

363.05 364.07 B: um 

364.44 366.21 B: there was not 

366.56 368.02 B: uh [mn] 

368.10 370.16 B: there was not biased 

370.19 372.44 B: you know towards any towards any side 

372.25 373.98 A: right 

372.52 375.38 B: or towards any interest if they had any interest in 

375.42 382.10 B: going in and doing something it's like you know if they had a mutual party that was it was designed for a peacekeeping process now in 

382.01 392.29 B: in you know terrorism wouldn't have existed if if there wasn't a a reason for them to do it you know if if they if they didn't have a problem with a a huge problem with us then 

392.30 395.05 B: then they wouldn't be any terrorism so 

395.12 404.28 B: i don't i don't think there should be too much money really put into any kind of military um installations whether it be defence or or um 

404.29 405.49 B: or uh 

405.84 408.04 B: attacking yeah mhm 

406.93 413.61 A: r- right i and you know i agree to a point i to me you know and i'm thinking on a smaller level 

413.52 414.56 B: mhm 

413.90 415.71 A: let's try to take it to a bigger level 

416.24 424.89 A: i if if i'm within say in a house on a hill and i have neighbors round me who are shooting at me i'm certainly not going to go set up a bunker 

422.09 422.89 B: right 

424.94 427.55 A: to fire at them or to keep them from shooting at me 

427.33 440.95 A: on their property what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna stabilize mine so that they can't do that and i'm not going to and you know the thing is is what i don't think they're thinking about is when we put an installation like we have over in iraq or wherever we might have one 

432.18 432.88 B: (( mm )) 

440.89 443.47 A: we're pumping money into their economy 

443.50 450.09 A: because our soldiers have to be there and our military has to be there which is just giving them more money to do what we don't want 'em to do to start with mm 

450.15 460.51 B: well we actually don't put any money into their economy when we're over there we take everything from from the u._s. to bring over to to iraq we don't actually uh get any 

459.33 460.44 A: (( yeah )) 

460.53 462.28 B: supplies or um 

462.66 467.09 B: yeah anything that would boost their economy in any way shape or form 

467.76 468.64 B: um 

468.96 470.20 B: but um 

471.04 475.38 B: i mean really we're we're completing taking away from their economy if anything 

475.40 480.61 B: some you know shutting down the shops we're not letting people shop and all the looting that's been going on 

480.67 484.85 B: the we the americans have- haven't been doing anything to prevent um 

485.31 490.57 B: and really their economy's been absolutely crushed um 

489.59 504.51 A: but don't don't you think they're trying to stop it from being a police action like vie- you know vietnam was supposed to be vietnam was supposed to be a police action and at that point i think they're trying to stop that from happening there but they're not accomplishing stopping the rioting and the looting 

504.46 505.29 B: (( uh-huh )) 

505.15 508.28 A: i mean it's almost like they're stuck in between you know what i mean 

508.36 509.89 B: i think there's 

508.47 512.42 A: and and if you can't be effective in where you're at and what you're doing 

512.91 515.36 A: i'm not i i just don't see putting money into it 

515.92 516.89 B: right 

516.81 517.66 A: i mean if 

517.05 517.99 B: um 

518.54 527.96 B: i mean i mean the basic the basic thing is we should not be there at all you know and and um the there's no reason we should be there um 

523.35 524.64 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

529.10 532.60 B: and and it's all in in the interests of um 

533.02 541.33 B: you know corporations that that really really it's all in interests of corporations that really have you know the big say in 

535.73 536.53 A: (( ri- )) 

541.42 543.36 B: most everything um 

544.43 545.57 B: in america 

544.49 551.92 A: so so you think that they're they're setting it up for american or u._s. corporations to make money in in the rebuilding and uh 

550.26 551.25 B: yeah 

552.45 556.26 B: i mean nowadays i think i think there's extreme proof 

556.32 567.76 B: uh you know and not only corporations but but uh large um richer you know people like with the looting of the museum that happened recently uh 

567.91 570.14 B: they removed um 

569.21 569.97 A: (( [mn] )) 

570.98 573.28 B: laws that said that they couldn't 

573.50 575.26 B: export things 

575.73 585.46 B: just in order to sell things from the museum that they looted uh but they did not prevent uh from stopping um you know they 

585.55 586.41 B: are 

586.63 596.50 B: making it so that iraqi oil can be sold on the free market which generally means that th- now american can buy their oil 

596.52 599.95 B: it it's all it's all the uh
