16.38 20.20 A: uh i guess my feelings on on foreign relations are 

19.37 20.80 B: [noise] [noise] 

20.62 25.57 A: are are pretty strong i think uh there's a couple of countries out there that that uh 

25.69 28.81 A: are a serious a serious threat to the united states 

28.02 29.80 B: [noise] exactly 

29.58 32.69 A: uh i believe uh um iran 

32.91 40.88 A: although they're trying to show that uh they have support uh they're trying to do the right thing i think they're uh probably not is the reality 

39.42 40.55 B: mhm 

41.55 47.05 A: and uh obviously north korea uh has got a real problem [laughter] right now 

47.57 50.28 A: and i'm not sure how we're gonna resolve with those guys 

51.59 56.11 B: yeah it's you know it's it's become real hectic um 

56.93 65.17 B: frankly i was surprised at north korea i don't know why they wouldn't like us but maybe i'm just not too intellect on that you know 

65.09 71.09 A: well you know i y- y- i have to agree i mean they they they seem to be 

71.17 74.53 A: uh playing by the rules there for a while and and uh 

73.41 74.46 B: mhm 

74.88 79.48 A: all of a sudden they just kind of jumped up and i think i think it probably stemmed from when uh 

79.65 87.73 A: president bush named the three axis of the axis of evil which was iraq iran and north korea that probably perked their ears up 

83.30 84.72 B: oh

89.15 90.92 A: [laughter] 

91.30 94.01 A: i think that got him going i think that got him going 

93.59 104.87 B: yeah because i know i was listening to the news and korea they were cooperating and the next thing i heard they wanted to fight us too i'm like oh we're not gonna have a friend in the world 

104.22 107.65 A: i tell ya it's getting it's getting to be that way and more and more every day isn't it 

107.39 112.72 B: yeah it's terrible and my you know i live in an apartment building and 

112.75 116.03 B: i have a lot of people here from um

122.94 124.26 A: mhm 

123.65 124.93 B: and uh 

125.37 133.31 B: you know i was a little skeptical at first when i first i did i didn't realize you know because i go in my door into work and come back home 

133.41 138.23 B: well originally when i moved here there was a lot of latinos here that's all that was here 

137.75 139.10 A: mhm 

138.64 146.07 B: and uh when i started seeing these people come out with their face covered up i'm like oh my god where where are they coming from 

145.64 147.24 A: mhm mhm 

146.41 156.57 B: and i realized they lived here some of them at first i guess they were kind of skeptical of me also because they wouldn't speak they'd just get on the elevator and it's 

156.50 164.97 B: it's kinda strange when you ride the elevator with someone five floors down and they never say a word they're just looking at ya out the corners of their eyes and you're looking at them 

165.14 168.32 A: you're gotta wonder you're gotta wonder what's on what's going on in their mind 

165.44 166.66 B: so um 

167.91 169.81 B: yeah and so uh 

170.37 175.01 B: my my daughter you know she's fifteen and she was saying mummy 

175.16 183.05 B: do you think that maybe they want to bomb the building i said well we won't even think like that we'll just leave it to the man upstairs 

182.50 183.76 A: mhm 

183.18 185.80 B: (( and and pray that he'll keep us safe )) 

185.89 190.79 B: [cough] and i did i prayed here for peace here in the building as well as world peace 

190.36 191.22 A: sure 

190.91 192.49 B: (( and uh [cough] )) 

192.57 205.26 B: i guess maybe they could see it in my eyes or whatever just get vibes from me so they started speaking i speak one lady in my building she asked me she was so inquisitive she was chewing on some tobacco 

205.48 206.48 A: really 

205.52 215.08 B: and she was yeah she was one of the foreigners there had her face covered up one day the next day she didn't she was coming up from the laundry room downstairs in the basement 

215.09 220.72 B: and she asked me a lot of questions i said hi good good good afternoon she said good afternoon to you too 

220.76 222.52 B: (( where do you live )) 

222.68 224.19 A: oh i live in ohio 

223.88 229.11 B: i said huh i said here in the building oh who you live with do you live alone 

229.45 234.65 B: and i just got real agitated and it was it was a rough day for me and i told her i said look lady 

235.14 237.23 B: i don't even know you okay 

237.04 238.15 A: (( oh mhm )) 

237.68 240.19 B: now we're taking it slow and you're asking me 

240.29 245.00 B: you know how i'm doing and that's good enough but how i live with and where i live well i said lady 

245.05 251.31 B: first of all before i tell you anything you have to uncover your face i don't even know what to tell the police you look like [laughter] 

250.34 252.11 A: [laughter] 

251.68 256.44 B: [cough] and i caught myself and i was like okay maybe i've over reacting a little bit 

256.45 266.71 B: so i told her i said well i live here in the building and you moved here not long ago she said no i haven't been here long i said well welcome to the building and and have a good day and i left you know 

266.98 268.19 B: but um 

268.28 272.58 B: since then i've seen her and she speaks to me and i speak to her 

272.46 285.09 B: what really kind of bothers me though is when they get on the elevator and i think it's quite rude but maybe they feel not because they don't understand what i'm saying but they get to speak in their language and i'm like oh here we go you know 

283.95 285.89 A: mhm mhm mhm 

285.12 287.31 B: even if you don't know what they're saying
