46.86 48.24 A: um 

49.10 51.71 A: well do you want to start first with your opinions 

51.66 60.50 B: well to me it's a real broad topic because the middle east it depends how you want to describe them does it stretch all the way you know through north africa 

60.36 71.87 B: to oh to a- near afghanistan virtually um there's so many different issues i mean does it include turkey or not and that's a whole issue unto itself

72.69 87.69 B: palestinian israelis that's been going on for quite a while and then you've got recently afghanistan um and iraq uh and those are the hot spots let alone all the uh

88.52 91.73 B: ongoing continuing problems 

90.10 96.34 A: oh yeah there's a lot of stuff going on over there but i don't know like uh 

93.24 94.20 B: (( right you )) 

96.22 108.78 A: my opinion is like i think america should just work on like building america and like the economy and all that stuff i don't think it's worth it to lose our soldiers over there and they get killed and stuff 

109.19 117.49 B: know that's really hard you know to to weight how much is a soldier's life worth can we really put a value on something like that 

109.78 110.68 A: i 

114.11 116.31 A: yeah it 

116.61 130.45 A: yeah because i mean they're people you know we don't want to lose our soldiers and stuff like that so i i figure that'll save money too because it's it's expensive too right for the war like the bombing 

128.86 131.34 B: it sure is that's right 

130.37 140.26 A: yeah and then we could like work on like poverty or like building america and you know get us going like i know out here like i'm in the computer field 

140.18 145.71 A: in chicago computer jobs are terrible they're laying off left and right um 

144.51 147.45 B: [cough] right yeah the whole tech industry 

146.18 153.88 A: yeah yeah so like we should build our economy and get it going and you know the tax will start going up and then 

154.41 157.88 A: you now it'll make our country like a strong country 

157.87 163.22 B: uh i think there is one special consideration regarding the middle east and that is 

163.60 176.59 B: our dependence on foreign oil a lot of that foreign though not necessarily coming to the united states but world oil exports come from the middle east and because of our energy dependency we would be in a lot of trouble 

176.47 181.66 B: if we didn't have access to oil exports coming to this country 

180.69 182.59 A: oh yeah that's true 

181.94 191.41 B: so i mean we do have that dependency look i don't know how old you are but nineteen seventy three seventy four the impact of the oil embargo at that time 

191.45 192.35 A: uh-huh 

193.62 198.42 A: yeah i'm i'm twenty one uh i'm sorry i'm twenty four 

195.92 197.08 B: okay 

197.99 205.33 B: all right i i'm fifty four so no i i was in college in graduate school at the time of the oil embargo 

205.29 213.97 B: and it's severe impact um i i would just hope that we could become more independent energy independent 

205.43 206.33 A: uh-huh 

213.93 221.56 B: and and so be able to be more inward looking um and less 

221.99 227.17 B: um dependent on what's going on other places around the world 

227.05 239.33 A: yeah i agree with that um i wonder that doesn't america have oil like in alaska and in texas and stuff like that is that enough for us to survive off of or it's not 

238.43 241.06 B: well um the it 

241.03 244.62 B: [mn] in recent years domestically we've been able to 

244.52 253.58 B: uh provide less than half of our oil requirement we've got quite a bit of natural gas but oil petroleum and therefore and gasoline 

253.43 260.64 B: you know as a consequence of that um less than half now quite a bit of it does come from canada and mexico 

260.83 262.15 A: oh wow 

262.39 273.79 B: um but uh still um there's there's a whole world economy based on the oil so for instance europe which is much more dependent on uh middle eastern oil or japan 

273.67 288.50 B: gets a lot of oil from the middle east uh if they couldn't get it from the middle east then they'd have to start getting it from some of our sources like mexico nigeria venezuela indonesia so um angola 

275.97 276.85 A: mhm 

286.22 287.19 A: right 

288.29 294.77 B: uh so it's um it's not like we can say oh that's the european's problem it would become our problem too 

294.91 296.27 A: 'cause then 

296.46 301.06 A: 'cause like the places we buy from they're gonna raise the prices then right 

300.46 303.78 B: um exactly and uh 

304.18 313.91 B: there there were gas lines have you ever gone to a show uh um some uh entertainment type thing and you see the line of women coming out the bathroom 

314.03 315.23 A: yeah 

314.65 321.33 B: okay it was like that getting into the gas stations lines of cars back in seventy three and seventy four 

321.35 322.25 A: uh-huh 

321.80 332.49 B: and there was a real sense of panic am i gonna get in in time when can i gas up because i have to wait in line it's gonna take me forty five minutes to to get gas today 

332.56 342.71 B: i i i'm down to half a tank uh i better get gas because i don't if they're gonna be running out or not some of the gas stations are closed because they run out of gasoline 

332.84 333.65 A: (( wow )) 

343.12 344.18 B: um 

344.43 347.40 B: so we're it it's a real weakness 

347.90 348.77 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

348.57 349.62 B: that we 

350.12 353.73 A: and gas prices are kind of expensive too nowadays too 

350.15 351.10 B: (( have )) 

354.20 355.35 A: (( like )) 

354.79 356.98 B: uh i don't think so 

357.55 358.98 B: but that's my opinion 

359.24 363.05 A: uh-huh how well what are the prices out where you're by 

362.99 365.29 B: uh let's say a dollar seventy a gallon 

365.73 367.53 A: oh wow that's 

367.54 370.33 A: cheaper than ours ours is around one eighty nine 

370.28 371.33 B: okay but 

370.61 372.82 A: some places are like one seventy nine 

372.45 374.93 B: yeah but if you went to europe how much would it cost you 

375.64 377.66 A: three four bucks or something right 

377.07 380.06 B: four to five dollars a gallon that's right 

379.55 380.52 A: wow 

380.26 389.87 B: so you know that we're we're spoiled here when it comes to that and if you look at the the value of the dollar and how it's changed 

389.70 397.24 B: gas prices i don't think have really done up a whole heck of a lot in the last ten twenty years 

397.02 406.77 B: gasoline really is cheap i mean how how carefully do we think about the the trip the car ride we're about to take whether we really need to 

397.06 397.98 A: uh-huh 

407.53 408.91 A: right 

409.02 411.15 B: how far do you work from where you live 

411.68 413.36 A: um uh 

413.72 416.52 A: about fifteen minutes away from work 

416.12 419.73 B: well i live abut twenty minutes away from work but that's walking 

419.90 422.00 B: how many people walk to work 

419.96 420.85 A: uh-huh 

422.24 423.75 A: not many people do 

423.56 432.07 B: right public transportation it's it's not a consideration it's you hop in the car off you go uh for many people it's not a consideration 

431.47 435.09 A: right [cough] mhm 

433.46 438.70 B: it's it's you know i'm just every day fact of life you get the car and go 

439.14 449.01 B: and and you go down the the expressway and how many people you know how many cars just have one person in it and uh a large number of them it's not the majority 

450.12 452.24 A: right 

451.83 454.90 B: and we've got to pave all this asphalt as a result 

456.11 466.10 B: if we wanted to to reduce the traffic jams if we could get people to live closer to where they work they spend less time on the roads or maybe not even have to drive to work 

459.84 462.19 A: (( yeah )) 

467.00 476.76 B: take the bus the l. um walk to work bike to work find some other ways and that would really go a long way i think to reducing our dependence 

467.40 469.16 A: yeah 

476.86 478.06 B: on foreign oil 

478.09 480.14 A: mhm 

480.43 483.90 A: yeah that's true but i mean it the thing is 

483.91 491.69 A: most people are spoiled by the luxury of driving their car so not many people are gonna take the public transportation and stuff 

487.22 488.53 B: that's right 

491.70 493.61 B: well what would get people to change 

495.92 497.57 A: higher gas prices 

497.37 502.09 B: yeah yeah gasoline five dollars a gallon then they're gonna think twice 

497.65 498.55 A: (( i guess )) 

502.24 506.26 A: right but the ones that have the money it won't matter to 

507.28 521.44 B: [mn] i think it will i think as long as they have to go in that filling station and fork out uh forty fifty dollars to fill up the car um they it they'll feel it 

519.56 520.21 A: (( them )) 

523.44 525.32 A: yeah 

525.57 530.08 B: they're gonna know by the way i've got thunder and lightning here so 

530.17 533.86 B: if anything happens if you hear any crackling that might the cause 

534.02 534.98 A: oh 

535.46 544.58 A: yeah we had uh thunderstorms yesterday but now we're all set seems like uh it's it's sunny outside it's uh fifty six though it's a little chilly 

545.78 548.95 A: usually it's you know in the seventies or eighties out here 

549.11 557.62 B: well usually what you get we'll get more more a little bit south of ya but we'll get that another day later i think yeah 

555.82 556.68 A: uh-huh 

557.65 567.97 B: look back back to america in the middle east um i i i don't think we can cut ourselves off from it i think we're we're stuck with it and uh 

567.00 570.19 A: yeah seems like that we're probably stuck with that issue 

570.15 574.10 B: and i think we can play a role of being a good role model 

574.39 576.09 B: being a good influence 

576.19 581.17 B: and and there'd be some benefit out of that and in the long run i think it would come back to to help us too 

576.39 577.51 A: (( uh-huh [cough] )) 

581.69 583.56 A: (( mhm )) 

582.53 583.77 B: i'd hope so 

584.30 591.35 A: [noise] yeah hopefully like [noise] things will get better and [noise] everything will change and stuff 

591.85 599.89 B: people have long memories and uh it'll take a while to get things to change but but there's hope i think there are places around the world where things have
