11.90 21.66 B: ah p- pretty much i i had a call yesterday and it was the same [sigh] the same ah topic [sigh] um i think the first question is like what [sigh]

24.67 30.18 B: ah [mn] ah you know reduce illegal activity [sigh] and let's see 

32.01 40.23 B: [lipsmack] oh talking about the recent corporate scandals and you know d- do we think that ah [mn] t- that they were responsible for the fall in the stock market [sigh] 

40.42 42.84 A: [noise] oh you mean like enron 

42.83 45.17 B: yeah yeah 

44.77 47.99 A: th- they're saying about utility companies or uh-hum

59.64 60.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

64.34 68.10 B: [sigh] i guess you know a good start is to just enforce the laws that are on the books 

69.92 74.63 A: yeah that would ah [laughter] that probably do a lot of good [noise] 

74.42 82.84 B: [sigh] yeah and and i think a lot of times it just depends on [sigh] on you know how how hard they're how hard they're looking [noise] some you know sometimes there's [sigh] [lipsmack] 

83.08 86.42 B: ah you know there's kind of a discouragement from being 

86.57 90.35 B: [mn] you know i i think it comes from the higher levels in in governments and som- 

90.77 92.90 B: [sigh] you know sometimes ah people are 

92.95 97.66 B: you know less enthusiastic about enforcing the laws or more enthusiastic 

97.03 103.65 A: right oh right right very i i just find it pretty ah [noise] 

104.14 117.42 A: i don't know i don't know what the right word is but it it's [sigh] it's not right to for the the feds you know the the federal government would use [sigh] all kinds of surveillance for different areas [sigh] like the f._c._c. [noise] and ah [noise] 

117.59 120.83 A: um [noise] [lipsmack] what's the one for the 

121.13 122.57 A: the airlines [noise] [noise] 

122.63 129.15 B: [mn] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] oh the let's see the c- c- [sigh] the civil aviation let's say civil aviation oh f._a._a. 

128.50 136.00 A: right f._a._a. right [sigh] so you know they they have they they watch over different aspects [sigh] 

130.18 131.35 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

136.21 140.56 A: and ah why why would they leave just companies by themselves 

140.88 144.06 A: to do whatever they please [noise] when 

143.00 144.96 B: [sigh] well yeah 

144.36 153.84 A: you know when when the when the record says most companies are showing are not good [sigh] when when they go private [sigh] it seems like when it's a public company it's not as bad 

153.83 156.26 B: [sigh] yeah of course that that's hard to sa- 

154.49 162.86 A: but when the company goes private [sigh] then we have like adelphia and enron and [sigh] nameless other companies lately 

156.91 158.28 B: (( yeah [sigh] [noise] )) 

161.90 163.63 B: oh yeah 

162.91 165.31 A: they have come under s- scandal 

165.47 170.99 A: and it's been going on for five years or ten years or even twenty and [noise] you 

171.06 173.84 A: know now all of a sudden they're just bankrupt 

173.42 179.35 B: [sigh] yeah yeah it well it can i mean [sigh] it's when people in top management ah 

179.23 191.16 B: [sigh] get the idea that somehow the rules don't apply to them and [mn] they can do what they want i mean it it it even has happened recently in new york city with the ah [mn] i think it's called the the the port authority [sigh] 

191.06 198.23 B: you know the ah people that run b- ah basically the port of new york [sigh] and the [sigh] and the 

198.29 202.58 B: ah [sigh] the bridges y- you know with the the toll bridges and the 

202.60 203.41 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

202.62 209.63 B: [mn] ah you know the subways and everything [sigh] it turns out that they were [mn] that they were asking um 

209.75 214.35 B: for approval from [mn] from the state and the city to increase the fares 

214.45 222.68 B: [sigh] and and they misrepresented the the you know their financial situation to make it look like they really need the needed the money 

214.97 216.12 A: right 

221.16 222.97 A: right right [sigh] 

222.70 235.85 B: [sigh] and it turned out that ah their financial situation was actually very good that they had you know created a false impression in order to [sigh] to ah [sigh] ah you know g- get a a hike in in fares [mn] and then um [lipsmack] 

235.91 248.95 B: now i guess the [mn] i don't know if it's the state or the city but they've [sigh] ruled [laughter] that they've got to reduce the fares now [sigh] because they increased because you know the whole the whole [sigh] argument for the increase was based on false information 

242.55 243.82 A: (( [noise] right )) 

248.97 249.53 B: (( [sigh] )) 

249.25 253.00 A: so now they're decreasing them that's 'cause they found out 

252.70 256.20 B: yeah so they've having to roll back roll back the fares a little bit [sigh] 

256.48 257.67 B: yeah 

256.52 261.14 A: yes that's good [sigh] and they they should hold that in place for you know a few years [noise] ah 

261.16 264.34 B: yeah [sigh] yeah what part of the country do you live in 

264.24 266.71 A: i'm i'm in niagara falls new york 

266.53 267.83 B: oh okay 

268.04 271.37 B: [noise] ah that's that's a nice area i'm in arizona [noise] 

268.41 269.34 A: and you 

271.10 272.40 A: (( oh yeah )) 

271.84 274.50 B: yeah probably a lot cooler [sigh] 

272.52 273.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

274.31 275.18 A: yeah 

274.77 281.39 B: up where you are it it's been like you know hundred [sigh] it's been above above a hundred for about the past week or ten days here 

281.14 282.38 A: (( oh [noise] my god a- )) 

282.65 283.87 B: (( [sigh] [mn] yeah )) 

282.88 288.57 A: and it it's been actually pretty crappy here raining and cold [sigh] and chilly here 

286.74 287.86 B: oh yeah 

288.45 291.82 B: [mn] yeah [mn] well you know one of the questions was ah [mn] 

291.85 299.62 B: ah you know do we think that [lipsmack] all these corporate scandals were the reason for the f- fall in the stock market 

299.33 300.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

299.66 300.22 B: (( [mn] )) 

300.50 301.27 B: ah 

300.58 302.85 A: i i think it's more of a 

303.66 307.34 A: [sigh] the things have not been going for the last two years [sigh] 

307.52 309.40 B: yeah i i agree i 

307.55 312.58 A: you know it's called call scaling and a and a big event 

313.12 322.37 B: yeah i i i think you're right i mean [sigh] i mean hey a bubble's gotta burst ah sometime and and there was a pretty big bubble developing ah 

322.46 325.41 B: [sigh] you know there in the [sigh] late nineties 

322.68 323.65 A: yeah 

325.70 327.48 B: [mn] especially in the 

326.18 333.18 A: right the late yeah that's what i'd say too about ninety seven maybe ninety six [sigh] it started changing 

333.26 347.63 A: a lot more than what it was [noise] and you know like what what really boggles my mind is al greenspan [sigh] is still the chairman you you know time after time [noise] [sigh] and the economy has only been 

335.03 336.57 B: yeah yeah 

348.09 353.37 A: you you know it's it's all under pretenses that it's been getting better and it hasn't 

353.02 354.84 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] yeah )) 

353.46 354.53 A: (( you know )) 

354.58 361.19 A: i i would think that somebody would recognize [noise] that [sigh] and and and try and have a different chairman instead of al greenspan [noise] 

361.24 366.60 B: [mn] yeah oh you know re- really there [mn] there's not a whole lot that they can do anyway 

361.49 362.36 A: (( you know )) 

366.71 367.40 B: (( [sigh] ah )) 

367.41 373.44 B: y- you know i mean even in [sigh] things like you know reducing or increasing the the interest rates [sigh] 

373.64 374.59 B: i mean 

374.77 375.33 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

375.38 376.60 B: they they've 

376.95 391.38 B: like in japan they to try to get the economy started they reduced the interest rates to the a- about the point where [sigh] [lipsmack] they were nothing [laughter] probably less than one [sigh] less than one percent and [sigh] and people still weren't borrowing and banks still weren't [laughter] l- lending [sigh] 

385.20 386.03 A: yeah 

391.01 392.02 A: (( well )) 

391.95 395.37 B: so but i do i do think that ah 

392.39 393.46 A: (( no kidding )) 

395.39 408.42 B: that the fed went overboard in increasing ah interest rates because they were they were r- ratcheting it up just as the e- economy was starting to come down [sigh] i mean they were worried about the the economy overheating 

398.16 399.09 A: right 

408.54 419.51 B: and yeah it was overheated but ah [noise] [laughter] it it it's probably going to come down on its own they didn't have to h- help it along by [sigh] you know ratcheting up the interest rates 

420.14 423.42 A: [sigh] i i i think i think one of the main things of 

423.63 427.60 A: of why do we keep hitting these economy fluctuations 

427.74 429.40 A: (( [sigh] is because ah )) 

429.75 432.67 A: wages don't continue to grow 

433.52 441.54 A: wages don't continue to increase [sigh] but i- inflation does a- and you know like the price of bread 

441.76 443.03 A: from 

443.28 446.37 A: fifty years ago is so much different from today 

446.50 449.86 A: [sigh] and even ten years ago it's still different from today 

449.75 451.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah )) 

450.51 457.17 A: and and you know it's just p- part of the way our economy is structured [sigh] that it's always gonna be 

457.33 463.67 A: it's gonna built up [sigh] and then it's gonna hit a crash and then it's gonna start getting better and build up again 

463.57 471.98 B: [noise] [noise] well i think a lot a lot of it's just driven by psychology you know like [sigh] in the [sigh] telecommunications sector [lipsmack] 

464.05 464.99 A: (( you know )) 

472.04 475.07 B: with the you know companies like [sigh] ah 

475.28 485.37 B: cisco and nortel and things and motorola and things like that [sigh] i mean they were their orders were [sigh] [noise] increasing so fast that they were afraid if they didn't [sigh] 

485.37 490.69 B: you know gear up to produce more [sigh] um that they'd lose market share 

491.26 492.06 A: right 

491.42 494.92 B: and and so what happened was that you know they were [sigh] 

494.96 503.78 B: they they built up these huge inventories of stuff that didn't sell because all of a sudden the the customers customers that were putting in you know [sigh] 

499.04 500.18 A: right 

500.60 501.71 A: yeah 

503.84 513.33 B: bigger orders every month just ah started cancelling orders and [sigh] so they got stuck with this huge overhang of [sigh] you know ah 

506.59 509.26 A: disappeared right 

514.07 521.93 B: c- capacity to produce and i- inventory already [sigh] [noise] in the pipeline and [lipsmack] so there was nothing to do but [mn] 

520.71 528.95 A: [noise] and and it's funny how you said that because then you then you know shortly after you saw each of those companies [sigh] ah cut employees 

528.76 531.17 B: oh yeah we've you know we know lots of 

529.80 532.44 A: motorola cut employees and 

531.92 532.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

532.62 534.75 A: cisco cut employees [noise] [noise] 

532.74 533.56 B: oh 

534.17 543.19 B: absolutely we had we had ah you know here in arizona we probably had ah [sigh] oh six friends who were [sigh] en- engineers employed by motorola 

543.07 544.32 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

543.68 546.32 B: and only one of them still has a job there 

546.16 548.00 A: yeah see that's crazy 

547.90 552.71 B: yeah and two two or three of them have been you know out of work for c- close to a year now [mn] 

554.36 555.44 A: no kidding 

555.26 556.08 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

555.46 557.24 A: well i know what that feels like you 

557.80 558.57 A: (( know )) 

558.68 561.44 A: yeah and then then again it says ah 

561.57 567.99 A: for some reason it's everybody says that our economy is strong and their jobs are [sigh] high and ah 

568.02 572.75 A: you know people have held their jobs long you know for a long period of time lately [sigh] 

572.88 574.35 A: and that aint true 

574.52 587.02 B: [noise] well you know it's i guess it's all relative i mean we can look at [sigh] you know some you know some countries like france and germany where [noise] the unemployment rate's up around ten percent now and ours is like five or six so [sigh] 

586.56 587.76 A: right 

587.20 593.81 B: i guess if you know if [sigh] ninety four and ninety five percent of the people are still working that's [laughter] you know it's 

593.87 595.51 B: sort of like the glass ah 

595.54 598.83 B: you know ninety five percent full or five percent empty [laughter] 

598.57 599.65 A: right
