3.74 4.82 B: joey 

5.22 6.16 A: what 

5.97 7.80 B: ah my name is joey 

7.81 8.79 A: joey 

8.55 9.92 B: yeah 

9.35 11.03 A: cool where are you calling from 

10.43 13.12 B: ah i'm in new jersey where are you 

14.02 18.03 A: ah tacoma washington you know near seattle [noise] 

16.99 20.14 B: yeah i'm i'm right outside of new york city 

18.69 19.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

19.98 21.07 A: oh cool 

21.36 25.74 A: okay so let's see i guess we'd better get down to business here huh talk about family 

25.12 29.17 B: yeah [sigh] yeah well [sigh] oh 

29.32 30.57 B: um 

30.66 31.65 B: i know my 

31.73 36.51 B: my idea how family is is basically people you can 

36.49 48.46 B: -an trust and tolerate even for short periods of time and m- and you you see them maybe hey 

42.65 43.87 A: (( [laughter] )) 

48.62 54.10 B: hey five six times a year usually weddings baptisms funerals 

54.12 56.66 B: -als and that's pretty much it 

56.73 61.56 B: and then then there's your other family the family you select 

61.57 62.67 B: so 

63.51 64.64 B: (( of which )) 

64.83 68.91 B: as you see more often and and you can tolerate 

71.27 74.28 B: and what's your definition of family 

73.86 74.99 A: [noise] 

75.23 81.99 A: [cough] well i think that's an excellent start looks like you're really ah hitting the nail on the head ah as the old saying goes 

82.35 85.31 A: you can pick your friends but you can't pick your family 

85.94 87.03 B: right 

86.41 87.80 A: so 

88.48 92.46 A: the plus part is that you're always going to have some good people 

92.89 96.27 A: in your family or people that you like right off the bat 

96.22 97.21 B: right 

96.65 104.67 A: and and [cough] and that you think are good but it's it's kind of about you're already getting along with them naturally 

104.92 111.99 A: but then again on the other hand you're always going to have people that maybe you don't get along with you don't like or they don't like you or whatever it is there's something else 

111.89 113.44 B: exactly 

112.20 113.22 A: friction 

114.13 115.68 A: (( [cough] but )) 

115.70 117.17 A: in the long run 

117.59 118.61 A: um 

119.54 121.19 A: you're going to have to 

121.90 124.01 A: to a certain degree learn how to 

124.75 126.09 A: get along with them 

126.99 128.39 A: and 

128.63 133.36 A: so that actually makes you a better person even though it's a big pain in the butt 

130.96 132.14 B: right 

133.96 134.84 B: (( -ight -ight )) 

135.46 136.93 B: (( and ah um )) 

137.03 143.81 B: family you you don't have to like them but you do have to love them to a certain extent 

144.22 146.62 A: wow that's a that's a good way of putting it 

144.29 145.36 B: (( yeah )) 

146.89 147.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

147.95 149.04 A: yep 

149.94 151.14 A: so 

152.26 153.47 B: i mean 

152.40 155.34 A: it's so- yeah it's sort of like growing up 

155.93 162.02 A: ah when you're a kid you really want to grow up and then when you find out how hard it is to really [laughter] be an adult 

161.82 163.07 B: yes 

162.25 166.24 A: (( and and [cough] and you're actually ah )) 

166.55 171.44 A: getting to that age when you have to move out and go to work and stuff like that in your twenties or something 

171.94 175.47 A: ah as long as you can delay it then ah then you turn around you 

175.97 177.77 A: you don't want to grow up and 

177.69 178.83 B: right 

177.83 179.10 A: and so forth 

179.75 184.95 A: and that's another thing about families there's always a pecking order like kind of who's the boss 

185.08 191.17 A: and it's all about playing house and who's going to be the actual daddy and who's the [cough] 

191.21 194.80 A: means who is supposed to be the daddy who's the real daddy and who's the mommy 

194.83 200.62 A: and stuff like that and who gets to be the baby and the problem in most families is everyone wants to be the baby 

200.50 202.89 B: right well 

201.65 204.56 A: and nobody wants to be the parent [laughter] 

203.43 204.65 B: yes 

205.15 212.80 B: well i ah in my family yeah i'm an only child so when i talk about family i 

212.83 215.83 B: i think m- i think more of 

212.91 214.33 A: oh excellent 

216.37 219.19 B: aunts and uncles cousins 

218.38 219.42 A: (( mm )) 

219.25 221.85 B: rather than brothers and sisters 

222.26 225.75 A: do you did you have an imaginary playmate when you were really little 

226.53 230.38 B: um sometimes yes and 

229.77 231.89 A: i have heard that that is like 

232.52 234.86 A: just about 

235.06 238.74 A: across the board it's very prevalent among only children 

238.76 242.78 A: if that's the correct terminology politically correct sensitive term nowadays 

243.08 245.43 A: um [laughter] that ah 

243.97 245.10 B: well in 

245.50 247.67 A: it's it's like a natural 

247.72 249.41 A: natural um 

250.37 256.28 A: way that the mind works to keep yourself company is actually putting a name on 

256.31 257.33 A: you know 

258.31 259.60 B: (( [noise] right )) 

258.36 265.72 A: someone kind of the the kind of person that you m- that you'd like to have for your friend and and putting all those qualities on there 

266.29 270.71 A: [cough] and from what i've heard it's act- you're actually very well adjusted when you do that 

272.01 274.72 A: and it can you can really function well 

275.05 279.71 A: when you when you were raised as an only child you and you end up being a like kind of a oh 

279.86 286.71 A: you can get along with all other different types where they were younger the youngest or the oldest or big family or little family 

286.51 287.94 B: right 

287.38 289.00 A: the type that can 

289.10 293.75 A: it'd be like blood types the type that you'd be like a universal donor you can get along with anybody 

293.55 295.06 B: exactly 

295.44 298.37 A: do you feel that way in your life that that ah 

295.49 296.41 B: and 

298.97 305.13 A: when you have to get along with people like professionally that you have no problem doing so pretty much 

305.17 311.05 B: ah yeah but too i'm ah i'm a bartender well i 

310.38 311.22 A: (( uh-huh )) 

311.45 312.61 B: so 

312.58 313.81 A: wow 

312.81 319.06 B: almost most of my cust- i look at my customers as family and 

317.92 319.36 A: [cough] interesting 

319.41 320.88 B: yeah i mean 

320.95 323.72 B: and and i know when 

322.80 327.20 A: well then how how do they look at you are you like their parent or something 

327.25 329.46 A: or are you their uncle or 

329.43 331.89 B: (( i'm well )) 

330.31 332.70 A: their brother what's the deal there 

331.91 342.63 B: oh some of them look at me as a brother some of them look me at at me as a cousin and and um and depending on the mood 

334.04 336.82 A: (( hm )) 

337.85 338.82 A: yeah 

342.56 349.97 B: -ood i'm in i'm either a mother a father a brother a lover a whatever huh 

344.08 344.95 A: yeah 

345.96 347.20 A: (( man wow ))

355.19 356.56 B: yeah i mean 

356.67 357.59 B: yeah 

356.97 359.19 A: and so being an only child has 

359.59 361.75 A: has kind of dovetailed with 

361.91 363.75 A: with your your profession 

363.49 365.86 B: right exactly 

365.23 368.31 A: it's actually equipped you well for that how cool is that 

368.85 372.00 A: see i'm the youngest of just two which is 

372.33 378.39 A: apparently ah looking at my dad who's the youngest of six and my uncle's the youngest of three 

379.27 386.99 A: quite similar just somehow when you're the end of the end of the line and you've been treated like the baby by the by your siblings 

379.55 380.99 B: right 

387.46 390.80 A: then ah it certainly leaves a mark on you is what i'm thinking 

390.67 392.41 B: (( well -ell )) 

392.47 400.11 B: in my with my family hey my father who b- is the youngest of nine a very large ital- 

393.86 396.51 A: (( hm )) 

399.10 400.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

400.12 402.49 B: a very large italian family 

400.48 401.51 A: (( wow yes )) 

402.23 403.50 A: all right 

402.71 406.40 B: aye six boys three girls 

406.10 407.02 A: cool 

406.42 419.71 B: what was it on my mother's side eh my mother's the oldest of two oh i i grew up up with my mother's mother -er in the house my parents were divorced 

409.18 410.08 A: yeah 

419.70 420.69 A: uh-huh 

420.13 422.99 B: so -o my grandmother [mn] 

421.09 427.22 A: and and now th- isn't the youngest more likely to be isn't the youngest in the whole family more likely to be kind of cute 

427.43 428.57 A: you know 

428.66 430.32 A: (( and and ah [cough] )) 

430.44 434.20 A: the oldest likely to be more sober more serious 

434.15 447.43 A: you know ah maybe can fool around play around but basically you know can always like ah just put a little edge on the voice and say okay now we gotta you know get something done and you know the one that that that finally ah gets results 

447.49 451.42 B: right yeah -eah to an extent yes 

451.53 453.75 B: yes i mean i 

452.80 460.73 A: i think i notice that in the military that i don't know if it's the born leader thing you know so much as the family position 

457.62 458.69 B: yes 

461.48 463.66 A: ah had a lot to do with 

463.90 468.76 A: how they how they related t- in ah in a group of strangers and 

468.73 470.15 B: right 

469.55 472.51 A: that's another thing now that i think of it the military 

472.73 475.42 A: when you talk about them being your family 

475.86 480.61 A: and ah boy you sure can't pick pick that family either when you're when you're stuck with a bunch of ah 

480.96 483.53 A: a very mixed bunch of people 

483.71 486.18 B: but still oh 

485.44 486.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

486.37 491.26 B: well y- w- in the military you have to look at them as family because 

490.13 495.92 A: oh yes oh very much and i'm saying it's it's built to function like a family and but and the officers 

493.63 494.61 B: yeah 

495.94 497.33 A: are the daddies 

495.99 497.19 B: right 

497.25 498.21 B: right 

497.47 500.07 A: and the sergeants are more like the mommies 

499.91 502.60 B: right and 

501.55 503.06 A: (( and ah )) 

503.99 514.59 A: and then again you know like i say and some you know peoples' orientation their their family structure makes them more adept at either of those two different roles 

515.22 516.83 B: right 

516.22 517.85 A: yeah 

518.27 519.40 A: so 

518.51 519.08 B: (( [sigh] )) 

519.39 520.60 B: excuse me 

520.41 522.62 A: yeah i guess you can never get away from 

522.89 524.77 A: from being in some family you're 

524.54 525.61 B: right 

525.08 527.20 A: always going to end up in some kind of a group 

527.47 528.89 B: and i mean 

528.59 529.97 A: (( and you've got to function with it )) 

530.00 531.22 B: and i 

532.19 537.98 B: d- i look at it yeah at the family that i've selected for myself as 

536.47 538.84 A: (( hm )) 

538.16 550.71 B: as somewhere you know where i'm in in the middle ah with s- one group i'm i'm the oldest in another group i'm the youngest in a third group 

549.23 550.26 A: wow 

550.64 552.24 A: that can be yeah 

550.83 553.89 B: oh and i have you know 

553.22 554.07 A: (( wow )) 

553.90 558.59 B: um and with my families i'll phrase it that way because i 

557.43 559.34 A: yeah yeah 

559.13 563.86 B: ah i consider myself you know i consider myself -elf 

564.25 565.30 B: (( -elf )) 

565.38 572.71 B: of part care taker part everything and and yeah i try and do it all 

567.61 568.64 A: (( mhm )) 

569.00 570.74 A: mhm mhm 

573.32 575.00 B: in a family way 

575.04 581.73 A: mm oh now see now that's a good word there caretaker that makes me think of the role reversal that happens 

582.02 585.73 A: as we get older as adults because 

586.98 588.34 A: pretty much when 

588.41 592.33 A: let's say well let's say i'm like fifty okay and my mom's like eighty 

591.92 593.19 B: right 

592.73 596.35 A: we get to a certain point wh- when your parents are getting like elderly 

596.71 599.89 A: and they're they're pretty much kind of reverting to babies in their
