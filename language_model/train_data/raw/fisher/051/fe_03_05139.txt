0.07 3.37 A: angel banta from jacksonville florida 

2.83 4.87 B: hi i'm mary nelson 

4.93 7.07 B: could you tell me your first name again 

6.96 8.14 A: angel 

7.67 8.74 B: (( oh okay )) 

8.40 10.39 A: hello there mary how are you 

9.80 11.18 B: i'm good how are you 

10.76 12.95 A: i'm fine where's home for you 

12.90 14.84 B: ah salem south dakota 

14.56 18.59 A: oh wow up north it must still be cool there 

16.24 17.00 B: yep 

18.07 19.54 B: it's cool today 

19.22 25.35 A: okay great so we're talking about computers whether they help or harm education 

25.69 26.59 B: okay 

25.82 27.77 A: you wanna go first 

27.33 30.66 B: sure i got my opinion [laughter] 

29.04 32.15 A: (( [laughter] well i'm willing to listen to )) 

31.55 34.82 B: okay um i think that 

34.89 38.28 B: computers when they're used properly 

38.38 43.11 B: um can help education but i think they start them too young 

43.75 56.01 B: and then um they don't have enough time to learn their basic um things like maths and reading as well as they could and they they try to substitute computers for those things 

56.90 57.87 B: um 

56.96 57.86 A: (( it )) 

58.92 61.75 B: so in a nutshell that's how that's what i think [noise] 

61.67 67.50 A: well i think you have some valid concerns there i think if it's not properly introduced it may 

67.57 76.82 A: harm their ability to learn other things but i don't think it's a permanent harm i think that a lot of them m- more than more than make up for it 

76.73 82.77 A: i basically feel that technology in our culture is changing so much 

82.72 85.23 A: [noise] that the old way of teaching 

85.00 98.65 A: and the old way of learning things even including basic math is going the way of morse code you know it was a necessary way of communicating at one time but now it's no longer really necessary but it's still 

98.52 108.57 A: ah used by some i think computers offer a new opportunity to jump to the next step in education ah when properly used 

108.67 121.95 A: virtual reality ah being able to see side subjects besides the subject that you're learning on the computer you have easy access i know i'm jumping around but i really would what i'm really trying to say is 

121.94 125.52 A: you have so much information at your finger tip 

125.64 126.42 B: yeah 

125.89 135.38 A: the only harm could be is that you may not concentrate on a specific subject but i think when properly formatted and properly monitored 

135.33 141.25 A: it will be an immense tool still untapped for the future 

141.36 150.69 B: oh i definit- definitely agree with that and ah children i i do think they should start young on computers but not quite as young as they do 

151.02 152.32 B: and um 

152.62 155.88 A: what age do you consider young or too young 

154.65 157.74 B: well they have them in kindergarten now um 

158.02 161.19 B: i'm thinking third or fourth grade they should start 'em 

161.19 163.20 A: oh okay 

161.74 167.60 B: because most most people have 'em in their homes now and they're using them to some degree at home 

164.92 166.27 A: mhm 

167.80 172.63 B: i i know my kindergartner uses her computer at home 

171.59 172.98 A: mhm 

173.27 175.17 B: um but ah 

174.11 175.72 A: does she enjoy it 

175.30 176.41 B: i'm sorry 

176.10 177.47 A: does she enjoy it 

177.32 179.94 B: yes she loves playing games and ah 

180.20 187.35 B: and ah um doing ah maths and maths drills and things like that on the computer 

187.06 191.89 A: do you think it's helped her the math drills doing it on the computer or harmed her 

191.84 196.01 B: well so far um see i home school 

195.70 197.61 A: mhm 

196.79 203.70 B: and i make sure that she is learning the very basics so and a lot of you know 

200.66 201.79 A: okay 

203.74 206.65 B: teachers just have so many students 

206.80 209.01 B: that they have to pay attention to 

208.80 209.85 A: yes 

209.48 210.33 B: that 

210.44 212.77 B: you know some of 'em get left behind 

212.47 213.64 A: yes 

213.44 219.86 B: which is what happened with my son and why i started home schooling one of the reasons in the first place 

215.42 216.48 A: okay 

220.06 225.74 B: um because he got so far behind in ah reading and spelling and and maths too 

226.17 228.26 A: i see your concern yes 

227.91 231.66 B: so i took i so i took him home and he's slowly catching up but 

231.75 232.70 B: um 

234.70 236.58 B: i just think that they have to 

237.42 244.29 B: concentrate more on on teaching the children the basic math and reading because 

244.65 249.24 B: if you don't know maths and if you don't know reading computers aren't going to do you any good 

248.83 253.73 A: that's true you still need to know what you're reading on the computer 

253.25 254.22 B: right 

253.77 267.36 A: and the only way you have some sense of whether the answers you are getting on the computer are correct is if you develop confidence from knowing from the beginning that their answers on the computer are the same answers he would have come up with if he did it the long way 

266.83 267.78 B: right 

267.61 273.11 A: i agree with you entirely as far as age you know i think a lot of times 

274.00 287.61 A: in fact all the time might be just the way computers are introduced i know my children my son was introduced to a computer when he was not even a year old and his concept of the computer was taking it apart 

282.88 283.73 B: uh-huh 

287.29 288.74 B: [laughter] 

287.92 299.39 A: [laughter] and not being able to put it back together but we had an old one around along with a printer and he wasn't afraid of the technology he grew up with it and then he started to go on the internet 

289.79 290.99 B: yeah 

292.85 293.73 B: mhm 

295.40 296.12 B: sure 

299.74 306.40 A: but he started to learn his basics as far as reading and arithmetic even before kindergarten 

305.61 306.81 B: mhm 

306.81 308.24 A: and then ah 

308.25 310.34 A: he goes to a public school 

310.75 317.63 A: and he does very well at school and then he supplements you know the usual games on the computer 

317.33 318.19 B: sure 

317.74 327.11 A: but he also knows how to research subjects how to check on spelling words how to ah visit the local newspaper on the net and read it 

327.34 332.16 A: how to research using the net he has several search engines 

332.25 335.62 A: and now he's in the fourth grade going into the fifth 

336.09 344.76 A: and whereas going to the computer a laptop going up to the store going into a library is there's no fear at all 

344.80 346.97 A: and he's even teaching me things 

347.38 349.71 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

347.89 352.88 A: on it and i'm in the field i'm in information technology 

353.19 354.19 B: okay 

353.21 357.43 A: and i work with computers every day several hours a day 

357.68 363.94 A: so then as far as being young i think the combination of ah 

364.59 376.35 A: being on the computer and then at the same time doing the basics is an absolute must and i agree with you entirely you're right ah and and those two things have to go together 

373.12 374.07 B: (( yes )) 

376.27 384.73 B: well it sounds like you're a conscientious parent too so that helps a lot when a parent is involved with the child's education 

376.40 377.66 A: but 

384.43 385.81 A: yes 

385.55 389.14 B: and making sure that they are learning the basics and ah 

385.85 386.52 A: ah 

389.81 396.24 B: you know introducing intro- introducing them to computers or if they're interested in anything else too 

396.09 397.38 A: right 

396.86 400.55 B: making sure that they get exposed to it [noise] 

400.34 404.84 A: involved in a ah project where for one year 

404.99 409.02 A: a lot of his schoolwork and all of his textbooks was in a laptop 

408.30 409.10 B: oh [noise] 

409.20 413.44 A: and on the laptop he will do his homework assignments 

413.41 418.87 A: write on laptop write his journal do his do he'll do his writing skills 

418.25 419.18 B: mhm 

418.78 433.63 A: he will get his history lessons from it they will have information downloaded to the laptop and they will get some of their lessons that way it was part of an experiment because schools are finding that purchasing textbooks that go out of date as soon as they're purchased 

433.64 435.07 A: and um 

434.93 445.07 A: having to go through providing additional supplies they were comparing the cost of that as opposed to a laptop and the maintenance and possible loss of it 

444.87 454.43 A: and i think the schools will find that it's going to be eventually less expensive to hand each student a laptop give them responsibility for it 

454.29 466.25 A: and handling all their lessons and have the information up to date information downloaded to it and they could read about history that occurred last week on their laptop this week 

465.93 466.99 B: (( sure right )) 

467.10 469.37 A: and i think once 

469.62 473.31 A: the population in general tends to accept that 

473.19 484.66 A: education through a computer will be an asset it will enhance their learning skills it's not the computer that's the problem it's the way people us are implementing them 

484.44 486.21 B: oh yeah definitely 

485.62 492.93 A: and we're not tapping it the right way and using it as a proper tool but like with all new tools there's a learning curve for the teacher 

493.03 495.03 A: a learning curve for the parents 

495.17 502.99 A: and a learning curve for the children but i marvel at the world they're inheriting if the older ones don't manage to blow it up 

502.97 504.81 B: oh [laughter] 

503.80 512.53 A: they may be able to have civilization make a major jump that will benefit everyone on this planet by sharing information 

512.87 516.75 B: yeah you know i've been have been waiting for the next major 

516.98 518.17 B: breakthrough 

518.32 524.97 B: invention that will change everybody's lives you know like how the old automobile did and then the 

525.17 527.18 B: you know and the airplane and 

526.45 528.03 A: mhm 

528.12 529.79 B: the computer of course 

529.80 530.59 A: yes 

529.99 533.03 B: i i always wonder what's next [laughter] 

532.11 536.60 A: i think the computer and the internet will allow a child in ethiopia 

536.97 539.77 A: a child in manila philippines 

539.84 544.40 A: a child somewhere in afghanistan and a child here in the united states 

544.47 551.35 A: to have the same lesson taught to them even in their own language translated instantaneously 

552.46 555.01 A: and they share their information 

555.19 562.78 A: that will keep the world on an equal footing it won't leave people behind and it will perhaps 

559.62 560.58 B: mhm 

562.61 571.17 A: remove some of the barriers that's keeping the humanity from being united 'cause once you could get united and when there's a single focus 

571.56 573.01 A: work together 

573.41 583.81 A: because help eliminate a lot of the problems in the world today but i don't think we have it in us not not our generation to fix that but maybe our children 

583.82 590.46 A: will see the world a little bit differently and the computer is definitely doing that helping them to see it through different eyes 

586.20 587.64 B: (( yeah well i i still )) 

590.54 592.92 B: well i i'm glad you said that 'cause that's 

593.15 596.71 B: you know one of a our generation's um 

597.01 598.67 B: problems is that [noise] 

598.80 599.89 B: we were
