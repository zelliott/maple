266.97 269.11 B: um i wasn't born here but then 

269.48 272.52 B: been quite some time i've lived here 

273.32 274.43 B: um 

276.05 277.57 B: [lipsmack] since i was about four 

277.44 278.93 A: oh yeah yeah 

278.10 279.33 B: and now i'm twenty two 

279.20 286.05 A: yeah what brought you there uh was it your family job transfer that type of thing 

285.79 294.48 B: [noise] no down here uh mostly i was i i had a big old crush on a girl who i was chasing around and it was who had lived down here 

294.53 301.05 B: so that's how i ended up down here in south florida um [noise] and i'm still together it's she's probably my best friend 

296.32 297.71 A: yeah yeah 

300.40 302.37 A: oh yeah that's good 

301.10 303.90 B: that i have right now and so we're really close 

302.60 303.71 A: (( that's good )) 

303.79 313.83 A: yeah that's great that's great things might not have worked out like you had originally planned but if they're working out the way they are now 

313.48 315.76 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

313.95 317.03 A: you possibly uh you know 

316.96 323.59 A: uh crushes come and go and next thing you know um you'll bump into her 

323.50 336.67 A: and she or her picture's in the paper where she was getting married but if you're still uh best friends with her well that's uh more than anyone could ever ask for so you're lucky i guess 

326.62 328.46 B: [laughter] 

335.93 337.22 B: sure yeah 

336.53 338.61 A: the best way to say it you know 

337.65 348.56 B: [mn] we're really tight i i'm fi- i i think sometimes that's the most challenging thing that i've found is trying to balance a really close relationship to be romantic or that 

339.19 340.72 A: yeah 

348.60 353.29 B: has that element to it with having other friends outside of it 'cause sometimes thos- 

350.15 351.04 A: mhm 

353.58 356.59 B: those romantic relationships are pretty consuming 

356.43 358.93 A: oh sure definitely definitely yeah 

358.01 365.94 B: and you kinda make the decision either you have a social life or you have that romance a lot of times it's you have to kind of decide 

365.33 367.58 A: yeah uh sometimes you're 

367.80 378.75 A: wanting to uh have the friends on the outside and i'm not saying you're cheating or anything like that but the consumption that uh 

378.79 384.57 A: is involved with the romance uh that kind of uh 

384.83 393.06 A: keeps that from happening and you might grow apart just from the fact of wow you've been together 

393.80 397.56 A: seeing no other faces for uh 

397.58 410.80 A: two straight weeks and you don't think okay uh let's end this relationship but just the fact that you want to spend uh some time with whether it's a male or a female friend 

410.59 416.67 A: and nothing's going on romantically it's platonic just that uh 

417.52 430.75 A: wanting to uh see another face for the a short period of time i'm not saying the person you're involved with is going to accuse you of cheating but before you know it um 

422.79 423.79 B: yeah 

430.88 432.63 A: you find yourself 

432.51 447.27 A: in the near future wanting to do it again and in the near future as more often you're wanting to do it again and you eventually um grow apart and that's not what you wanted in the very beginning 

440.30 441.07 B: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

447.12 460.91 A: and things happen without uh you being aware of it and next thing you know y- you leave a message you don't hear back from her and you leave [laughter] another message you don't hear back from her and she 

461.09 469.71 A: before you know it she's involved with someone else and you think boy i really messed up here i and you kick yourself in the butt 

469.50 479.92 A: uh for a long time if not forever thinking wow why did i go about it that way and you know you had nothing uh 

476.57 477.83 B: yeah 

480.04 490.40 A: [noise] in mind as far as uh doing something you shouldn't have been doing and she didn't suspect you but before you know it that's the way it turns out you know 

490.58 502.20 A: so it's really hard to do that balancing act like you said you know have you guys been uh friends a long time you and the yo- yo- young lady you were speaking of 

501.60 503.35 B: mhm yeah we've been 

503.64 510.65 B: friends about gosh almost five years and been together over three like romantically on and off and uh 

509.15 511.53 A: oh yeah yeah 

512.14 515.71 B: that's you know it's in it's in a really good place right now 

515.35 519.15 A: yeah well that's great that's great you can't ever 

519.24 532.49 A: top that and whether you were friends first or became friends later after the romance but uh you know you got the best of both worlds that's the best way of phrasing it you know 

530.26 531.58 B: (( [noise] yeah for sure )) 

532.21 533.09 B: (( for sure )) 

532.86 540.82 A: can't beat that that's uh [mn] men and women i would say in ninety nine out of a hundred they would uh 

540.90 551.72 A: trade places with you instantly you know they boy this was the way it's supposed to be i've always wanted it like this and you know they would envy you 

543.75 545.53 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

551.78 553.04 A: for sure 

554.73 557.25 A: so what do you do for a living 

556.75 564.28 B: [lipsmack] uh i do a lot in the a lot of volunteer work which pretty much takes up the majority of my time and then when i can get um 

564.48 568.07 B: i got a small grant recently for a community garden that i work in 

567.86 568.94 A: oh yeah 

568.34 570.69 B: (( and um [lipsmack] ))
