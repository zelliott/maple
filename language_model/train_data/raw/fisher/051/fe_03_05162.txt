92.16 93.62 B: yeah [laughter] 

98.33 110.73 B: martha stewart [sigh] ah well [sigh] i guess the old adage ah ah is applies to her too she's not guilty until she's [sigh] found guilty [laughter] [sigh] so ah 

109.43 120.53 A: [sigh] but that's true but they w- weren't saying it so much about [sigh] um you know the insider trading but the fact that she covered up and made ah false statements and 

118.32 119.36 B: yeah 

119.58 121.94 B: yeah she lied to the government about it 

121.20 124.11 A: and lied to her stockholders and stuff like that 

122.72 126.06 B: (( yeah yeah [sigh] certainly did )) 

124.31 125.54 A: and i don't know 

125.96 131.34 A: if you saw that movie on her ah a week ago i think it was [sigh] but it starts off 

129.12 130.06 B: uh-huh 

131.39 140.71 A: where she shortly after she gets married [noise] because she thinks her fiancee's got lots of money and then his father loses it all [sigh] she has to go to work and she goes to work as a stockbroker 

140.41 141.38 B: uh-huh 

141.63 156.34 A: [sigh] so she she knows she made her living as a stockbroker for a number of years and eventually had to leave town because [sigh] she advised people based on some information she had about a stock that she thought was going to go up [sigh] and they all bought and it didn't 

155.79 158.54 B: oh [laughter] i didn't know that [sigh] 

158.00 160.22 A: yeah and so she left town 

160.04 162.98 B: okay that's a good thing to do for her i guess 

161.06 162.30 A: and 

162.77 169.64 A: yeah well her husband was a lawyer in town at the time too but she was making more money selling stocks than he was doing d- [sigh] you 

169.66 171.30 A: know in his law practice 

170.54 171.74 B: (( [sigh] uh-huh )) 

171.54 178.99 A: so to me that's sort of you know i mean she's been here before she knows the rules [sigh] she sure knows the ropes about that 

176.39 177.34 B: (( [sigh] uh-huh )) 

179.01 181.34 B: that indicates her character a little bit huh 

180.85 183.20 A: [sigh] yeah to me it does 

181.76 184.57 B: yeah yeah i would think so too 

184.61 185.55 B: (( [sigh] ah )) 

185.89 188.56 B: (( but [sigh] ah )) 

186.05 186.88 A: (( [noise] )) 

189.42 196.35 B: [mn] i guess i'll hold my ah withhold my j- judgement until she g- goes to court if she does go to court 

193.70 195.43 A: [noise] well 

196.13 198.79 A: at this point in time we just know one side 

198.34 200.40 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] yeah that's right oh )) 

199.79 204.71 A: you know and that's been really highly publicized it [sigh] and you you don't want to 

205.12 213.28 A: overlook the fact that some eager prosecutor wants to make a name for himself you know [sigh] would would grab on to something like this because it's the way to get known 

213.08 223.84 B: yeah [sigh] but um [sigh] my my my opinion o- on on on the whole thing is that [sigh] education [sigh] does not make a person honorable 

224.46 225.39 B: you know 

225.12 226.45 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [lipsmack] that's true )) 

225.93 235.01 B: [sigh] ah it ah [noise] you can put a a a a jacket on a guy and a white shirt and a tie [sigh] but that doesn't make him honest [laughter] 

235.37 236.43 A: (( [sigh] that's true [noise] )) 

236.03 237.72 B: yeah [sigh] so 

238.32 244.75 B: [sigh] i i really believe [sigh] for the whole system to work [sigh] that um 

246.08 249.60 B: you you have to teach morals along with education 

250.01 251.57 B: [sigh] does that make sense to you 

251.18 255.56 A: [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [noise] [mn] that makes sense to me and i i think it's something how old a- are you dick [mn] 

254.99 256.51 B: i'm seventy 

256.15 260.79 A: oh you're seventy right so you'd know this a lot better than i because i'm i'm only fifty four 

256.96 257.86 B: yeah 

260.19 261.10 B: uh-huh 

261.34 267.38 A: [lipsmack] but in my father's generation would be which would be closer to your generation [sigh] they actually lived that way 

267.11 269.77 B: (( yeah [sigh] yeah they lived like that )) 

268.10 272.78 A: [sigh] you know you you didn't steal because it was [sigh] you know you because [sigh] 

272.87 278.25 A: it was wrong to do that you didn't you know if you could if you could tell a lie and get away with it you didn't do that 

274.21 275.07 B: (( uh-hum )) 

277.79 279.71 B: that's right 

278.33 283.40 A: [noise] you know you you said you did what you did and stood up and you know and took your medicine 

283.22 290.23 B: yeah [sigh] well i understand i've don't know this for sure that deals were [sigh] sealed [sigh] with a handshake 

289.87 292.96 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] yep yep that's true )) 

292.69 297.01 B: and ah [sigh] and a man's word w- was his bond [sigh] 

296.82 304.83 A: [sigh] and if you you're dealing in that industry and you it gets known [noise] that you don't you're not good to your word you're not in that business any more 

304.27 305.25 B: uh-huh 

305.27 308.36 A: [noise] ah people get to know who they can trust and who they can't 

307.54 308.69 B: yeah so 

309.03 312.91 B: that's that's what i think would help straighten out the whole mess [laughter] 

312.46 319.15 A: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] there's a little more yeah a little more m- moral ah a little more bit of a moral fabric there 

318.56 320.24 B: yes correct 

319.68 321.82 A: some kind of standards but i i 

321.88 325.92 A: i see it it going it's getting worse it's not getting better 

325.21 327.68 B: [sigh] oh of course [sigh] yeah that's right 

326.88 329.32 A: you know and i don't know how [sigh] 

329.46 341.45 A: you know if you get a company like that enron [laughter] and i i i what i know about that you know is largely from watching a movie based on the life of one of the guys [sigh] where he comes into the company and they 

338.94 339.81 B: uh-huh 

341.49 350.78 A: [sigh] they're explaining [sigh] you know what they do and what they've got [sigh] and they say that they've got fifty billion dollars um worth of virtual assets 

350.51 351.44 B: uh-huh 

351.58 355.52 A: [sigh] [sigh] and i thought to myself what the heck is that virtual assets 

355.67 358.95 A: [sigh] well it's just what it says it is it it's nothing it 

357.90 359.68 B: [laughter] 

359.01 365.40 A: [laughter] well it's something that they think that might be a good idea in the future [sigh] and if it really worked it would be worth this much 

365.14 366.11 B: uh-huh 

366.03 371.14 A: [sigh] and it went from that to where they were actually using that in their in their year end statements 

370.58 372.41 B: (( yeah uh-hum )) 

372.19 374.94 A: [sigh] you know a person would would ah anyway 

375.10 386.93 A: [sigh] you know and how they thought that that was th- that that was a- any way or shape legal or moral or anything like that [noise] and [sigh] how the guy who who signed on could believe that [sigh] you know not see it for what it was 

386.44 387.43 B: uh-huh 

387.19 400.28 A: but he did [sigh] he went out and he hawked everything and [sigh] ah you know lost hundreds of thousands of dollars lost his his his marriage and his fiancee and things like that [noise] because someone told him that virtual assets were real assets [noise] 

399.68 401.52 B: yeah right 

400.83 404.45 A: [sigh] i've got virtual assets a couple of million bucks as soon as i get it [sigh] [sigh] [noise] 

403.88 406.26 B: uh-hum it's um 

406.52 407.08 A: (( [sigh] )) 

407.45 408.34 B: oh 

408.64 415.37 B: [laughter] yeah you almost have to ask a person to define what is what he means by certain words you know 

415.19 417.09 A: (( [sigh] yeah exactly [noise] [sigh] )) 

415.97 424.25 B: yeah you can't say well now that means that but i- it really doesn't mean that it means something else [laughter] [sigh] yeah 

422.70 426.31 A: exactly [sigh] do you invest like in the stock market 

425.94 427.36 B: do i what 

426.79 430.22 A: do you invest in the stock market or mutual funds or anything like that 

429.80 433.04 B: [sigh] yeah i invest in ah in annuities [sigh] 

433.53 434.50 A: okay 

434.55 435.49 B: (( ah )) 

436.21 445.06 B: [mn] and also in in i have some money in [noise] b- bonds [mn] [sigh] i'll tell you i was very fortunate ah i guess i i had annuity in stock and bonds 

439.43 440.85 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] so [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

445.11 452.04 B: [sigh] and oh about two years ago [sigh] i i i kind of saw it creeping down 

452.46 457.13 B: [mn] so [sigh] i i i switched 'em to bonds and the bonds have done very well [noise] 

456.51 460.77 A: yeah [sigh] yeah well that's i don't know depending on what school of thought 

460.91 465.92 A: [sigh] you you go through that that's that's where you want to be when the stock market's in decline 

465.59 466.94 B: yeah 

466.42 472.16 A: [sigh] [sigh] is into bonds and you know the more the stock market declines the m- more you're going to get for your bonds 

471.82 474.54 B: yeah yeah it seems to be like that doesn't it 

474.03 475.40 A: [sigh] yeah well that's ah 

475.25 475.81 B: (( [sigh] )) 

475.85 476.97 A: um [sigh] 

477.20 488.23 A: you know you you look you study these things a little bit and there's one school of thought that says that that's what you do and then when the m- market starts to come back up [sigh] you get out of bonds and go into into ah 

488.52 491.03 A: cash like treasury bills and stuff like that [sigh] 

491.22 501.96 A: and then when you see for real that the the market's coming back you go back into the stock market then after [sigh] you know however many years when it starts to creep back down again you go back into bonds 

495.85 496.83 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

501.41 504.83 B: uh-hum well that seems to be the t- thing to do right now 

504.75 505.98 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] well that's )) 

504.87 508.03 B: [sigh] go back to stocks right now because it's creeping up 

506.64 520.73 A: [sigh] looks like it w- work [laughter] looks like its worked for you [sigh] i still invest but through mu- mutual funds and i have a like a deduction every every month i put in you know five six hundred bucks [sigh] and i've been doing that for some time and 

516.86 517.69 B: yeah 

520.57 534.04 A: [sigh] you know even though you you ah the market might be going down the tax benefit for doing that is so good that you really have to lose like well over half your money before ever you've really lost anything [sigh] at least up here that's the way it works 

526.23 527.41 B: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

531.15 532.89 B: yeah 

533.71 534.83 B: (( i see )) 

534.82 538.76 A: [sigh] so i anything you put into like your this is sort of like my retirement fund [sigh] 

538.56 539.43 B: (( uh-huh )) 

539.12 542.41 A: so it's it's like your ah four one k. [sigh] 

542.64 543.95 B: okay [noise] 

543.73 553.68 A: right so it it's called an r._s._p. up here [sigh] so if i put in a hundred dollars into an r._s._p. [sigh] then i can write off about about half that for my taxes 

553.20 553.98 B: oh 

553.90 557.73 A: [sigh] so in other words i'd have to lose half the investment i'd still be break even 

557.51 558.58 B: (( i see )) 

558.76 573.23 A: [sigh] now so that's the the reason i sort of stay with it [sigh] plus the fact that you know the market hasn't gone down that far and there's always a good possibility that it's going to come up because it's been down [sigh] for over three years now and that's the longest [sigh] 

573.45 576.36 A: down market in what ever 

576.16 582.19 B: uh-hum [sigh] yeah but it's starting it's starting to go up it' up it was up to nine thousand yesterday [sigh] i haven't looked at it today 

582.28 583.42 B: (( [sigh] ah )) 

582.45 590.28 A: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] well it just yeah it's the last couple of weeks now l- like we like you you you're doing the ah we do the the ah [sigh] 

590.09 598.33 A: t._s._e. stock exchange and you're doing the dow jones or what down there [sigh] so there are two different um you say nine thousand ours ah 

593.36 594.29 B: yeah 

598.51 599.89 A: isn't quite that high [sigh]
