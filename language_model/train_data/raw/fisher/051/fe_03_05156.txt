441.83 455.96 B: i mean i didn't never i was the oldest son so i mean i saw my younger brothers and sister grow up but um to see how they you know like my daughter and her and my son like we don't teach them anything specific to like 

455.75 464.73 B: you know being a boy or being a girl like you know like you have to play with trucks or you have to do whatever but just naturally they both do things that are 

465.02 467.80 B: you know like girl and boy related you know what i mean 

467.43 468.65 A: mhm 

468.02 470.79 B: like i don't know it's just sort of funny to see that 'cause 

471.74 472.88 B: [lipsmack] you know like with 

473.30 481.86 B: some people in the world the way ah you know that they decide to be ah you know well i believe they decide to be homosexual or whatever 

481.82 482.88 A: mhm 

482.22 483.03 B: like 

483.29 495.85 B: it se- it seems to me any way that it's like i i look at them and it's so natural that you know i didn't teach my daughter the way she needs to be and i mean we teach her obviously our the values that we have but you know like 

495.84 507.62 B: she just comes out a a while ago w- you know when she was first starting to talk whatever and she'd be like that's not for girls and we were like who who told you that you know it it's kind of like that natural thing it- it's funny to see how 

503.30 504.18 A: (( hm )) 

504.20 505.29 A: mhm 

508.25 514.80 B: you know they're actually real people but they're so small that you know y- you see them grow and you see them learn it- it's very interesting 

509.42 510.45 A: learning 

515.15 518.77 A: that would be interesting to see to see um 

516.93 517.93 B: yeah 

519.47 530.35 A: how they grow up and learn and you know they're they're part of you [noise] i mean they're they're basically they are b- you you know yeah

545.15 547.83 A: of marriages now don't don't last so 

547.93 549.53 B: yeah that's um 

549.08 551.15 A: statistical wise you know 

551.66 557.87 B: yeah it's just that's it's crazy 'kay i don't i mean i don't know what caused it maybe it's 

553.63 554.72 A: yeah 

558.40 566.12 B: i mean in certain instances you may just make a mistake and marry the wrong person or something but a lot of times i wonder if it's just more like selfishness you know 

565.89 567.13 A: yeah 

566.42 568.35 B: like as you get older or as you 

568.76 572.15 A: as you get older you get you you get more um 

572.43 577.34 A: [lipsmack] i don't know ah self sufficient kind of like set in your ways kind of like thing 

576.53 578.40 B: yeah yeah 

577.79 583.78 A: yeah 'cause i remember when i was younger i i i'd you know i'd always have um 

584.55 590.26 A: you know room mates and things and and now i don't because it was just ah 

590.39 594.34 A: it was just you know such a such a hassle 

594.21 595.63 B: right 

595.17 599.89 A: and and now i i you know i live alone it's so much easier you know
