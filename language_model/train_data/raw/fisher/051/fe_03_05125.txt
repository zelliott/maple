0.00 1.52 B: hi i'm mark 

1.10 3.03 A: hi mark i'm bob 

3.19 4.65 B: nice to meet you bob 

4.06 5.88 A: that's good where are you from 

5.44 7.99 B: i um i'm in new york 

7.38 9.50 A: okay i'm in washington d._c. 

9.08 10.21 B: oh wow 

10.03 10.88 A: (( and uh )) 

10.96 17.09 A: so as far as this topic is concerned do you think there are any other countries that are a threat to america 

17.12 20.80 B: oh boy uh probably a lot of 'em 

20.22 22.20 A: probably every one of them [laughter] 

21.43 25.03 B: yeah in one way or a- or another yeah 

25.04 38.50 A: but i feel that as long as if america can mind more their own business and take care of the domestic problems more they wouldn't have as many threats everybody seems to think that america is uh trying to be like a policeman to the world 

38.34 40.99 B: yeah like we're big bullies or something 

40.46 44.86 A: yeah you know uh we have so many domestic problems here i mean [mn] 

45.43 54.54 A: we have problems right here like right in my own backyard here we have problems right behind the capital you know we can't take of these problems you know but yet they want to go and tell other people how to run their lives 

50.00 50.87 B: yeah 

53.92 60.39 B: yeah i i remember i was i visited washington d._c. once and right across from the white house was a bunch of homeless people 

59.85 62.74 A: right living right there in lafayette's sq- park right you know 

62.32 64.70 B: it it's crazy it's like jesus you know 

64.61 65.78 A: but uh 

65.84 69.73 B: they're spending millions to go kill people instead of taking care of our own 

70.09 77.42 A: but i don't know what country would be an immediate threat i mean i would hate to name one because you know never know what people are thinking you know 

77.49 85.36 A: but a lot of countries are going to side with america because america's sent them so much financial aid and they get so much i guess 

82.79 83.81 B: right 

85.39 87.54 A: we've taken a lot of their imports 

87.66 91.87 A: and i don't know if we export that much to 'em but we get a lot of their imports and you know so 

91.49 92.60 B: yeah 

92.09 96.94 A: as long as they they've got uh financial booty there i don't think they're gonna be too 

97.12 103.13 A: erratic but then again you never know what your little right side left wing organizations over in those same countries are thinking 

102.87 111.66 B: yeah yeah i i pretty much i try to stay non political but with this war thing it's scary to me you know 

111.94 115.10 B: 'cause now they're talking about going after iran 

115.13 122.52 B: and i i do know that like palestine there's a lot of anti american people there 

121.97 134.71 A: well because america sided with i mean i'm not don't get me wrong i'm not prejudice but in nineteen forty eight america s- sided with the jewish people to take part of the palestinian land and form the state of israel 

134.69 144.52 A: and palestine really has a right to be mad because that was their home and israel come and say look we've taken this and we're gonna form another country you know i mean i don't know all the 

138.27 139.20 B: right 

144.55 157.93 A: political things behind it because i was born that year so i don't know what was going on but i do know that was the year that israel was given the land in palestine who gave them that land i'm not sure i think america had something to do with it you know so 

148.22 149.35 B: yeah 

156.38 157.39 B: mhm 

158.27 161.57 A: america backs israel like a hundred percent you know 

161.19 162.46 B: yeah 

162.02 169.01 A: so and palestine has a right to be mad i mean you'd be mad if somebody came to your background and said hey we're taking half of this yard for ourselves you'd be mad too 

168.37 179.58 B: oh yeah yeah yeah actually well that's the thing you know we gotta worry about all those people [laughter] you know and then there's even people in israel who don't think that we belong you know so 

169.55 170.47 A: (( you know )) 

180.42 182.58 B: i don't know it's hard to 

182.78 188.82 B: the whole thing just scares the heck out of me i i see it i see it at the end of the bible [mn] 

185.49 187.73 A: well i tell you what i don't have 

188.31 194.13 A: i don't really have time to be scared because i have to worry too much about surviving myself from day to day 

194.22 201.39 A: so you know i can't worry about things that may or may not happen you know i know that i do i'm a big believer in fate 

201.45 207.41 A: i believe whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen anyway nothing i can do to prevent it or anyone else can do to prevent it you know 

203.74 204.66 B: right 

206.99 209.17 B: yeah well i agree with you there 

208.62 217.36 A: so you know i had to even okay like i was really upset at september eleventh two thousand and one because that morning before it happened i was working 

217.35 228.77 A: and when and i'm self employed so after it happened everybody just stopped working the city was a mess right because the pentagon had got the plane had run into the pentagon and i guess the same thing was up there in manhattan you know 

223.23 224.15 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

228.47 229.51 B: yeah 

228.93 233.21 A: and uh i was pissed off because i was unable to work then because the city shut down 

232.92 234.15 B: yeah 

233.42 235.00 A: okay and then i don't have 

235.01 236.30 A: leave for being 

236.47 238.92 A: if i don't work i don't get paid simple as that [laughter] you know 

238.13 240.06 B: yeah i'm the same way 

239.16 249.13 A: so i was kinda ticked off behind it i mean i sympathize with the people that got hurt and everything that happened but i couldn't be concerned too much really because like i still have to work and and provide for myself 

243.79 244.80 B: yeah 

248.54 251.19 B: yeah you got to survive you still have to eat yeah 

250.47 264.17 A: yeah i can't be concerned about you know i can't walk around the city looking for terrorists jumping out of phone booths or i don't cans or stuff i can't worry about that you know if it's gonna happen it's gonna happen i just gotta keep living my life the way i can 

259.36 260.25 B: yeah 

264.17 266.34 A: you know and don't worry about those things 

265.63 270.53 B: yeah well i well i don't worry so much about it for me i worry more about my kids you know 

269.54 282.99 A: well i mean it's the same thing but you still have to remember that if it's preordained it's gonna happen anyway it's like one day you know that you yourself your whole family is gonna one day leave this planet but you don't know when 

275.80 276.72 B: yeah 

281.39 282.31 B: right 

283.14 297.00 A: if you knew when you would avoid it [laughter] okay but one day we're all gonna pass okay so you don't you're not worried about that right now i mean you you know you know it somewhere in the back of your mind it's there and eventually it's gonna happen but you don't really worry about it you know 

283.22 283.98 B: yeah 

285.34 286.25 B: yeah 

290.26 291.10 B: no 

296.40 297.33 B: yeah 

297.65 310.82 A: i can't worry about another country attacking america i mean i was in the military i was in the marine corps did the vietnam era right and i was taken from my home which was america and sent to south east asia to do somebody's work 

302.94 303.83 B: wow 

308.49 309.61 B: yeah 

311.11 322.51 A: you know to help somebody else win their freedom and we lost over there you know so to me it was a useless cause we already lost all those lives american lives and we still didn't get anything accomplished you know 

321.68 324.18 B: yeah and some of them didn't even want the help 

323.56 336.31 A: right you know so what's the purpose of us interfering when we got enough problems here we got poverty here we got homelessness here i mean we got crime here well let's start to straighten out our own backyard before we go in somebody's yard 

330.50 331.26 B: yeah 

335.46 341.05 B: yeah clear up that get the raking and stuff done back here first yeah i agree 

339.25 340.16 A: (( yeah you )) 

340.54 341.72 A: know so 

341.87 350.34 A: i mean this topic i mean they give us topics to talk about i guess that's what we have to talk about you know but it's uh to me i don't know i don't know what can be done 

350.25 352.33 B: (( yeah i i don't know )) 

351.27 364.54 A: well i've felt that in the case of two countries that have problems with each other that instead of sending their youngsters and that's who they're basically sending youngsters over to fight these wars why don't the two heads of state get together and they duke it out [laughter] okay 

359.13 360.11 B: yeah 

363.82 365.26 B: (( [laughter] )) 

364.63 377.20 A: and let the winner choose whatever they want but they never do that you know they always send the people the youngsters because i was i graduated from high school on a wednesday and got drafted that friday [laughter] i spent my summer vacation in vietnam [laughter] you know 

374.14 374.72 B: (( yeah oh )) 

376.03 376.97 B: damn 

377.66 380.53 B: and that wasn't much of a vacation 

379.89 388.72 A: well that's was at that time i had no choice i mean i didn't the mon- money of mohammed ali so i couldn't fight it you know [laughter] i had to go you know 

386.42 387.33 B: (( mho )) 

388.96 390.28 A: but uh 

390.17 398.32 B: i guess if um i was gonna say if i thought any other countries were a threat i would have to say iran um north korea china 

398.79 399.90 B: you know those 

399.19 401.79 A: every country on the planet is a threat 

401.54 404.30 B: yeah in their own way yeah they're 

401.86 402.87 A: okay 

403.27 407.73 A: they could be a threat because uh we have stepped on so many people's toes 

404.88 406.76 B: either um 

407.47 413.82 B: yeah either either war wise or ec- economy wise or something yeah there there is some kind of a threat 

413.25 415.78 A: okay and even if the country itself 

415.97 420.04 A: people that live in that country themselves could have harsh feelings against us you know 

419.31 420.89 B: yeah yeah 

420.11 431.76 A: and they don't i mean a terrorist terrorism doesn't actually omit from the country the people may live there but they're not a part of the governing body you know these are real sad organizations that are deciding and doing these things on their own 

427.30 428.27 B: right 

431.36 433.69 B: yeah well we've get them right here in the united states 

433.36 438.41 A: yeah well hey we got what's the guy's name bombed oklahoma city terry is that his name 

437.65 440.23 B: no i don't remember yeah the oklahoma bomber 

438.98 446.10 A: i mean he he was he was a u._s. soldier right [laughter] the guy that they just caught that uh couple of days ago up in the mountains 

441.42 442.94 B: (( yeah )) 

446.83 450.55 A: that was uh that he had had bombed atlanta for the olympics 

450.31 451.43 B: (( oh yeah )) 

450.80 452.66 A: they just caught him right 

452.16 453.42 B: yeah 

452.84 455.40 A: okay he's right here from america you know so 

454.73 456.61 B: yeah yeah 

455.58 469.34 A: how can how can you like when when a okay round september eleven they were looking for all middle eastern middle eastern people you know they were people were like afraid of them or they were thinking there might be terrorism but you got americans right here we- were do doing the same thing okay 

468.67 470.71 B: yeah that's true 

469.56 470.53 A: (( and )) 

470.92 481.82 A: everybody has free will they think the way they want to think and you can't change the way a person thinks i mean you can try to and sometimes you can succeed but if they don't want to change their way of thinking there's nothing you can do about it 

475.84 476.94 B: right 

481.64 483.59 B: no definitely not 

483.33 488.36 A: but i would think our biggest threat china's not a threat to us because china's 

489.91 497.43 A: you know so i don't consider them a threat a threat is someone i think is someone that you don't think has the power to do it i mean like 

491.83 492.70 B: right 

497.46 502.83 A: america couldn't go and fight a land war with china 'cause they we're outnumbered about twenty to one okay [laughter] 

502.50 503.50 B: right 

503.03 515.59 A: okay now they have the same missiles we have you know they have just as much nuclear power as we have so i don't consider them a threat they'll like we used to be with the soviet union you know we're afraid of them they're afraid of us basically so it's a stand off 

515.24 516.28 B: right 

515.69 522.14 A: but you have some of those off shoot nations like maybe iran i don't know about iran i don't think iran has as much as power as iraq you know 

522.02 526.38 B: yeah i know but i hear 'em on it i hear um bush on the news talking about it 

526.56 531.12 B: uh i guess that i think that's where they're trying to aim toward going to next 

530.50 533.70 A: but see over in the middle east it's all about oil okay [laughter] 

533.46 534.71 B: yeah i know 

534.05 537.48 A: you know it still comes back to the green dollar bill you know 

536.60 538.20 B: yeah 

537.73 542.85 A: they want to control the oil so you know america shut down all the oil wells here okay 

542.86 548.56 A: and they try to use imported oil because they they don't want to have to put people to work in america okay 

547.84 548.76 B: right 

548.56 562.67 A: but i mean in oklahoma and texas all the oil wells down there are shut up shut down and then open up the alaska pipeline and then they shut that down we trying to get oil from over across the seas so we can preserve our resources or so supposedly stupid but when they shut all these things down all these people 

559.35 560.74 B: right 

562.87 564.53 A: out of work okay 

564.31 565.26 B: yeah 

564.57 576.79 A: i mean when i was growing up i knew nothing about homelessness i never heard of it [laughter] i mean they had like hobos and stuff you know but it was no big thing they were out in the woods and stuff they didn't live right down town in the middle of the street you know 

569.03 570.52 B: (( no there )) 

576.53 578.05 B: right and 

577.01 583.01 A: i mean i i can walk right down town any day right down town white house you've got homeless people living all around it you know 

582.56 583.65 B: yeah 

583.04 585.01 A: and the nation's capital shouldn't be 

584.97 588.78 B: no no new york's the capital and up in albany it's the same way 

586.13 587.25 A: that 

588.60 590.16 A: okay you're up near albany 

589.99 594.06 B: yeah i'm actually between new york city and albany i'm out in the country 

593.64 599.90 A: okay well any place in this country here there should be no homelessness because we have enough natural resources and
