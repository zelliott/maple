9.93 13.00 B: [mn] so where do you like to eat restaurant or home 

13.07 17.39 A: well i don't know i have kind of mixed feelings about that um 

17.77 26.06 A: [noise] i i like to eat out i like a good meal out ah for a while for my job i was travelling a lot and so 

26.20 32.47 A: ate out a lot and ah it kind of got to the point where i thought oh jeez you know another fillet ah 

32.75 44.31 A: so it kind of lost its luster there but i don't travel nearly as much now so i [mn] i guess i like to eat a good meal out how 'bout yourself 

44.30 57.91 B: [mn] i don't travel much so i i don't eat out too much um mostly eat at home and i i enjoy eating at home i enjoy cooking i enjoy concocting the various menus that we have here 

57.99 59.33 B: ah 

61.06 65.29 B: [mn] so it's ah i wo- i would say i um i'm i really enjoy 

65.43 69.13 B: eating at home and cooking by m- and cooking a nice good meal 

71.18 82.59 A: well as a as as being the cook i guess i can understand that ah i'm kind of a minimal cook ah i i cook some but not a lot um plus 

82.76 90.31 A: um i have two teenage kids and so it seems like everyone's going a different direction ah frequently so 

91.02 97.03 A: so a lot of times ah we're not all eating at the same time and ah that complicates that whole thing 

98.27 105.54 B: so what about your perfect meal are you trying to keep the fats down or d- or don't you care 

104.83 113.63 A: well i am somewhere in the middle i'm not ah like totally health conscious [noise] but ah do 

113.87 118.39 A: do kind of pay attention and try and try and minimize ah [noise] 

118.63 126.90 A: some fatty you know sauces dressings that kind of stuff um which look which which seem to me like they're 

127.23 130.62 A: you know excessively fatty but ah 

131.00 133.78 A: [mn] i indulge a little bit but um 

134.06 137.54 A: you know weight's not a problem for me but ah i still try and be 

137.73 139.80 A: somewhat health conscious ah 

140.57 148.18 B: i think i'm i'm in the same boat i i'm not ex- excessively health conscious i i appreciate a little bit of fat 

148.25 156.99 B: ah now and then i don't go out of my way really to get rid of the fat when i'm cooking ah for example if i'm ah i'm cooking um 

157.55 161.50 B: chicken meatballs and i i'm cook i'm preparing the chicken 

161.61 170.02 B: ah i i'd rather leave the fat in because ah it it ah since i usually cook my chicken 

170.07 174.94 B: meatballs in a tomato sauce i think it adds that little bit of extra flavor to the sauce 

174.47 184.69 A: oh yeah definitely and also is ah you know helps it to cook i mean if you cook a fillet that's why they come wrapped in bacon right there's no there's no fat on 'em so 

185.03 189.17 A: some some fat's necessary for cooking and definitely adds some flavor 

188.97 191.39 B: (( oh i agree yeah )) 

190.72 200.16 A: but um you know like my my dad had a heart attack and so he's good for him you know very obsessive about ah you know no fat no 

200.34 207.60 A: no salad dressing with fat in it ah no cheese ah but i'm not anything close to that um 

207.94 214.56 B: oh yeah god forbid i hope i never get close to that [laughter] i don't i don't i don't think i can give up cheese 

211.15 212.65 A: right right but

225.67 228.07 A: a real fatty person and you know i 

228.40 233.55 A: if the food is cooked i cook i cut it off i don't ah

491.85 493.53 A: mhm 

493.28 496.28 B: just to give it some ex- a little bit of extra flavor

524.14 538.47 B: [mn] i just i- it just doesn't the kind of lobsters that i've been eating lately i don't find terribly flavorful it seems they seem to be flat [mn] flat tasting 

533.04 535.66 A: (( mhm )) 

536.66 541.95 A: yeah i i i don't know if it's yeah i don't know if it's what over 

542.04 547.47 A: over harvesting or i don't i i would agree i think i've noticed that too that um 

547.62 549.02 A: they don't seem to be 

549.60 554.56 A: um the flavorful like they always were ah 

554.60 560.26 A: like i say i don't know what the reason for that is but ah i i would agree i've noticed the same thing 

557.66 558.80 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

560.29 566.07 B: right so i've probably given up on lobster i think if i'm going to go out ah to a restaurant 

566.24 571.87 B: or um or a fast food place fast food fish place i'd probably order scallops 

571.06 573.33 A: (( mhm )) 

572.05 576.89 B: because i think that e- the scallop has a a better flavor than than lobster 

576.30 580.94 A: yeah yeah i ah you know i don't tend to order at ah 

580.99 586.72 A: i i think the last time i tried it i i thought it was good but not you know exceptional so 

586.83 596.95 A: ah ah it's definitely nothing it's not at the top of my list but i like it but ah it doesn't seem to be the the excep- the exceptional thing it once was 

589.82 592.72 B: [noise] yes yeah well 

597.10 599.18 B: (( i agree i agree ))
