344.72 345.72 B: (( yeah i )) 

345.89 349.69 B: i waited till i was about thirty two before i got married 

349.79 354.08 A: well i'm ready if i could find the right old gal i'd marry her 

351.13 352.10 B: yeah 

354.09 359.70 A: but ah my family hasn't done me any good fixing me with little girlfriends that's for damn sure 

354.15 355.08 B: (( yeah oh )) 

359.26 363.09 B: yeah well i've been married now for 

363.32 366.17 B: (( the past ah ))

369.86 371.29 A: well that's great 

371.05 372.01 B: (( yeah )) 

371.40 375.30 A: (( you waited long enough you you'd probably grown up by then )) 

375.34 378.36 B: yeah i guess yeah it seemed like it anyway 

377.30 378.09 A: some 

378.32 384.24 A: so so many people marry right out of high school and like i tell you what that's tough 

384.31 385.91 A: it's tough going 

384.38 385.52 B: yeah it is 

385.58 387.10 B: yeah 

386.60 388.54 A: it really is ah 

389.04 396.73 A: financially and and you still want to go out with the guys somewhat and the girls want to go out with the girls somewhat 

396.83 403.99 A: so um i really think you do need to be a little bit older but that congratulations on twenty two years of marriage 

403.94 407.77 B: yeah thank you yeah it was i haven't regretted it anyway 

408.15 410.26 A: well that's quite an accomplishment 

410.19 411.65 B: yeah 

411.05 414.13 A: fewer and few people can say that 

413.69 415.15 B: (( yeah [laughter] mm )) 

415.12 421.77 A: and i was just thinking in my immediate family nobody's been married twenty two years 

422.52 423.52 A: (( um )) 

423.66 425.37 A: (( both my brothers )) 

426.07 429.81 A: or all my brothers are married but they never got a divorce 

429.67 442.77 A: and i think that was partially again due to my father and my mother getting divorced and fighting all the time they learned from that and really settled with their mate but two of 'em married right out of high school 

443.28 447.87 A: and god they have struggled and it's put a strain on the family c- 

448.38 452.41 A: to a certain degree financially helping 'em and um 

453.51 455.24 A: [lipsmack] babysitting 

456.20 460.84 A: and i think the older you are the better the kids are i know one brother 

461.14 474.42 A: who got married when he was twenty six and had a baby when he was thirty that kid is so much better behaved than my brother who got married right out of high school and had a child 

474.69 478.47 A: it's just completely unreal the difference 

478.38 487.57 B: oh my younger brother there he's been divorced about three times and and he's still w- divorced today there so 

487.83 489.63 B: i don't know [laughter] 

490.39 499.14 A: maybe he's had his fulfil of marriage life maybe he decided marriage life wasn't for him i tell you what three divorces would scare me 

495.97 496.89 B: yeah 

498.74 500.49 B: yeah me too 

501.01 502.85 A: it really would
