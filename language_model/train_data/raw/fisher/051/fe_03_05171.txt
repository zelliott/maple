243.45 247.84 A: yeah so you're near to seattle or like or 

246.28 247.54 B: (( yeah i'm not ))

251.61 253.48 B: vancouver 'bout halfway yeah 

252.75 257.95 A: vancouver oh okay that side over there yes yeah i've been to uh seattle last year it was nice 

258.19 262.28 A: in september it was uh nice warm weather it wasn't too hot 

262.16 266.15 B: yeah well that's that should be sixties and maybe a little seventies 

262.73 263.47 A: (( you know )) 

265.88 270.06 A: yeah that's like san francisco they get they get some fog over there too so 

270.51 271.32 A: (( you know )) 

271.85 283.98 B: yeah but it's it's not as not as foggy as san francisco's supposed to be but then san francisco's sitting right on the ocean and you're really quite a ways from the ocean proper in seattle 

276.91 278.28 A: that's right yeah 

280.40 281.28 A: yeah 

283.58 288.31 A: that's true yeah that's a more uh friendly over there in uh 

285.06 286.05 B: (( so yeah )) 

288.59 300.10 A: definitely it's a better place seattle i mean yeah since i live near san francisco and i've been to seattle they're a much more cleaner and and uh you know uh seems like the air is nice over there or 

300.15 301.24 B: well 

300.42 302.41 A: the cleaner air yeah 

302.00 307.75 B: i think that has more to do with the fact that uh they just it isn't quite as uh 

305.09 305.96 A: yeah 

308.67 310.35 B: [sigh] uh moist 

310.35 311.29 A: (( yeah )) 

310.49 316.74 B: so it doesn't hold the uh the pollutants in as bad as it does in san francisco or l._a. 

313.93 315.13 A: yeah that's right 

316.50 327.27 A: yeah that's right yeah yeah but what about yourself what do you like to do in uh far as the weather wise are you warm weather you like to stay indoor or outdoor
