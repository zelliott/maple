0.46 1.56 A: hello 

1.47 3.10 B: (( [mn] hello )) 

2.74 4.06 A: hi this is don 

3.19 3.87 B: (( wh- )) 

4.06 7.19 B: hey don my name is cody um 

7.15 8.09 A: hi cody 

8.30 17.58 B: i think um education is improving because of computers and i think that's a great skill for the kids to learn at a very early age 

17.82 21.33 A: yeah wh- what do you think is so ah good about it 

21.84 36.62 B: well i think computers are gonna become more and more prevalent and i think the kids are going to need to use it i wish i had more computer skills everywhere i go the first thing they ask is do you have any computer skills 

25.21 28.14 A: mhm 

36.34 37.56 A: (( mhm [noise] i )) 

36.77 37.66 B: um 

37.85 43.11 B: i think in twenty years we'll be ordering everything over the computer not personally 

40.99 44.74 A: think you're probably right 

44.21 45.19 B: um 

45.09 46.01 A: (( [sigh] )) 

45.25 45.88 B: (( it's )) 

45.91 48.77 B: very convenient and very helpful 

48.37 54.96 A: [cough] i agree with the your perspective on the importance of computers being trained but i don't think it's important at a young age 

54.87 62.98 A: um my mother is a first grade teacher and [cough] it's been frustrating for her to have computers in the classroom because ah well for a variety of reasons 

62.83 76.78 A: um the teachers aren't given really adequate training to deliver like solid skills in in computer um programs like you know word processing programs and things like that they often end up becoming just things that kids play games on 

76.89 91.45 A: and also it ah from what she said it takes away from the time that they have to teach basic skills like reading and math and so at that younger level i'm not really for computer education because i think that so so many of the things that we have at home are computer 

91.47 97.60 A: based that i i think kids can pick it up pretty quickly at a somewhat later age like in junior high which 

96.76 100.01 B: i had no idea they were teaching 'em that you know 

100.05 106.10 A: oh yeah well see i'm not sure it's actually teaching but there's definitely a there's like massive grants given to 

106.04 119.29 A: put computers in classrooms um like for example like my mom's classroom first grade classroom where they're not really necessary whereas like that grant could be used for a lot more books or tools for teaching math or science things like that 

119.48 127.32 A: um or for providing computers maybe for like schools where you know they actually would have more use for 'em i think 

125.86 135.80 B: well i totally agree with you i i figured well i thought actually around fifth or sixth grade they were introduced to the computer i had no idea 

135.29 136.74 A: it's amazing isn't it 

136.87 142.11 B: yeah i mean that i think that would be very frustrating to the students as well 

141.74 152.22 A: yeah well there seems to be something that happens too to um the attention spans of younger kids i mean i think television has a huge impact on that but computers too 

152.40 156.55 A: that i wonder if in school they shouldn't be sorta allowed to um 

156.77 165.11 A: [lipsmack] ah learn at a a different pace that isn't quite as quick or as automated at least to provide a different experience 

165.75 167.23 A: does that make sense 

167.29 177.47 B: yeah yeah it's um it really does and i i agree with you i i had no idea it was introduced that young i don't think it is in 

177.34 191.64 B: around in oklahoma where i live and i could be wrong i haven't visited any schools i know my niece is in first grade and um she done she hadn't anything about a computer in her class 

180.19 181.03 A: uh-huh 

191.46 196.04 A: oh well it could be that my this particular school my mom was teaching at was 

196.09 204.52 A: they had some kinda like grant from a corporation so they may have had more school ah computers because of that but i do know they're trying to introduce them early on 

204.77 205.70 B: really 

205.65 207.59 A: yeah 

206.14 213.84 B: well i see your point on that i it's frustrating for me i can imagine a little first grader or second grader 

213.82 215.06 A: trying to do all the 

214.13 215.59 B: (( how frustrating )) 

215.45 216.79 A: computer 

215.94 225.32 B: yeah yeah i think it'd be very frustrating but i don't know you know i'm not a teacher but i do think they need to be introduced to it but i 

225.86 228.82 B: i'm i i would think 

229.52 232.60 B: sixth seventh [noise] eighth grade um 

229.74 237.93 A: mhm yeah i think that would probably be a good time like around seventh or eighth grade 

235.79 236.72 B: but i'm 

237.52 250.77 B: i'm i'm no professor or you know child psychologist by no means so i have no idea but um i would think that that would be very frustrating to the teacher and to the student i i agree with you 

251.15 256.48 A: i'm i'm curious about um the role of the internet as a as a research tool 

256.67 258.63 B: well i find it very useful 

256.72 261.20 A: that that oh i do too i find it incredibly useful 

261.22 268.72 A: but you know at the same time i wonder if there's so much information out there that really isn't verified and i think that kids 

268.66 276.41 A: well at least from my experience of being in college just as the internet was sorta starting to become um more widespread 

276.24 283.85 A: was that that would become like the only research that people did and i you know the sources that are available on the internet aren't always as 

284.08 291.76 A: you know detailed or as ah well backed up as sources from say a library 

290.09 298.66 B: really now i i wasn't aware of that i figured if you got it on the internet it was written in stone i just figured that but 

298.93 302.69 B: that's probably wrong thinking i i had no idea 

302.53 310.33 A: well anyone can put anything on the internet i mean you or i could just have a website and decide to write whatever we wanted and it wouldn't necessarily have to be true 

310.63 318.02 B: well you're probably right i mean that makes a lot of sense i'd um i i was listening to my aunt 

318.02 329.39 B: the other day and she was telling her doctor something she read on the internet and he said half of that stuff on the internet's baloney he ste- and she said well you know i i just 

325.33 327.29 A: yeah 

329.30 340.78 B: she goes that was dumbfounded she goes i just naturally assumed that that doctor never used the internet at all but you you know he might have a very valid point 

333.74 334.63 A: (( [cough] )) 

336.58 337.52 A: mhm 

340.26 346.95 A: it seems like it it's such a good research but you really have to be careful about where the information is coming from 

347.55 357.04 B: you're probably right and and that's something i haven't gave much thought to i just you know i just thought you got it on the internet it's probably correct information 

357.02 359.39 A: what do you think about email 

357.29 358.07 B: but 

359.25 366.80 B: i like email i like email it saves on the phone bill um i look forward to opening it 

360.82 362.56 A: yeah 

366.52 368.27 A: mhm 

366.79 380.53 B: just like getting a you know mail mail in the mailbox you know only there's no bill with an email you use less so that's that i find it very useful and i like it and i look forward to opening i do not like the spam 

370.52 372.25 A: mhm 

373.38 375.18 A: mhm 

380.50 382.03 A: mhm no 

382.49 393.18 B: the the junk email i i hate that you know and i get i get frustrated with that but if it's from a friend or a client or something like that i find it very useful 

382.69 383.62 A: no 

392.96 394.26 A: i do too 

394.65 396.88 A: i i i have um [cough] 

397.33 409.27 A: i have heard people talking about the way that email has changed the way people write by the way that the internet generally has changed the way people write and i i wonder about that in in education too um a friend of mine who was ah 

409.65 414.49 A: a t. a. a few years ago was saying that she'd noticed a difference in the way that students write now 

414.50 426.96 A: um when they're used to a word processors on computers or used to writing emails things are always sorta shorter and they're they're not always necessarily connected one thought to another because they can cut cut and paste ideas so much 

427.01 434.11 A: that they're the that writing now isn't cohesive in the same way that writing used to be prior to computers being so popular 

434.13 440.75 B: well that's probably correct information as well um i haven't thought about it but it's probably correct 

440.54 442.54 A: maybe it's not a bad thing i dunno 

443.30 452.07 B: well i dunno um i get very frustrated when a client gives me more information than i wanna hear i tend to tune it out but um 

450.61 452.42 A: mhm 

452.70 462.35 B: y- you do want well written thoughts you know you want to know where they're coming from and not being trying not try to figure out what they're meaning 

462.12 464.42 A: mhm 

462.37 467.73 B: but um i haven't thought about that at all but you're probably right there as well 

467.18 469.74 A: you use email for business quite a bit then 

470.07 471.04 B: um 

471.25 479.39 B: used to yes right now i'm currently not working but yes um we used to use it quite a bit it 

479.37 481.38 A: mhm 

479.43 481.50 B: was a very effective tool 

481.69 488.11 A: which er goes back to your original point probably that it it is important to learn how to use those sort of things 

488.82 490.69 A: for anyone 

488.88 489.87 B: (( i find it )) 

490.76 493.22 B: find it very useful um [sigh] 

494.20 501.56 B: and that's the first thing they ask you on a job ap- application is do you have any constu- er computer skills are you computer literate 

501.33 502.14 A: (( mm )) 

501.63 502.84 B: and um 

502.91 506.25 B: i think it's something that we all need to know 

506.48 519.21 B: and i find that the older people are afraid of it and it slows down banks but um i dunno if that's a good thing by by not using the computer it's a lot more personalized as well so 

512.11 512.82 A: (( mm )) 

519.42 522.23 B: and a lot of people like the personalized um 

522.23 525.18 A: mhm i agree with you there 

523.36 524.08 B: (( ex- )) 

524.15 525.35 B: it does like 

525.36 529.14 B: six of one and half a dozen of another but ah 

529.18 530.04 B: (( i dunno )) 

529.27 536.64 A: i think that's a good point about the personalized feel though of of not using computers i think you're right there i i know that ah 

536.49 545.77 A: i always do appreciate a communication that is handwritten or or something like that as opposed to just emailed although i like email too i think you're right about that 

545.05 549.97 B: i yeah we all look forward to our email and telling jokes over the email and 

549.40 551.26 A: mhm 

550.13 561.36 B: everything else um i like little chat groups you know you can learn a lot in the chat groups and there again is that verified information is that good information 

561.15 562.59 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

561.39 567.46 B: i don't know but it's interesting to read and um interesting to chat with your friends 

569.09 575.05 B: but ah i really like the computer i think it's a good thing i really do i'm ah i just moved 

575.22 576.56 B: to um 

576.78 585.63 B: and i'm living with my mother and i can't set up my computer she has her own computer but nobody touches her computer [laughter] 

578.69 580.79 A: mhm 

584.75 585.69 A: (( mm )) 

585.61 593.78 B: and um i'm really missing the computer i i didn't realize how how much i used it until i didn't have access to it 

593.34 596.37 A: yeah i use mine all the time 

596.62 599.90 A: i ah i wonder how much ah training kids actually
