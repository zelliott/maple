31.78 44.26 B: [lipsmack] like i'm very close with the friends i have right now um i don't have like a whole lot i would say it's like i pretty much just have like a close knit of friends that i kind of stick to 

45.07 46.00 B: and 

45.14 46.12 A: okay 

46.28 56.65 B: like in high school like i had a few too i never had like a whole whole bunch in high school but now like i really don't talk to those high school friends too much or i only talk to like one or two of 'em 

56.05 56.92 A: uh-huh 

56.88 60.97 B: and i kinda just like have my new college friends 

60.36 65.09 A: yeah i um boy i think in i'm 

65.60 74.33 A: in my forties so i you know high school i had probably a few close friends not a lot and then 

74.58 77.60 A: really more in college and uh 

77.71 84.71 A: probably have a lot more now than i ever have so as i've gotten older i've probably gotten more and more um 

80.05 81.09 B: (( but oh yeah )) 

85.33 85.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

86.71 87.60 B: huh 

86.99 96.81 A: you know there are some some friends of ours that you know we are closer with that we do stuff with that we see a lot more than others but uh 

96.37 97.49 B: yeah 

97.01 103.86 A: and some are yeah probably more than acquaintances you know people you know that uh we're friendly with but don't 

104.32 106.38 A: [sigh] don't do as much with 

106.19 107.30 B: right 

108.36 121.83 A: i'm and probably you know as as the parent uh of a couple you know teenagers uh you know they do a lot of stuff and so i end up uh knowing a lot of the parents of my 

115.18 116.08 B: (( oh yeah )) 

121.64 124.11 A: [noise] kids' friends and uh 

122.74 123.75 B: (( oh yeah )) 

124.54 130.01 A: so because of that there are a lot of a lot of people i know that i'm friendly with i guess 

131.12 134.06 B: mhm yeah then this year i 

134.27 138.87 B: i'm in a band fraternity and this year i was a district officer um 

138.93 152.28 B: like for the northeast so like i traveled a lot and like met a lot of people and they just like turn out like friends are kind of there kind of like automatically become friends 'cause you kinda have like this common bond and yet 

144.46 145.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

152.30 160.99 B: like i've traveling i got to meet so many people and like i was wondering you know how many i would stay in touch with and like if you know but like 

161.09 172.08 B: throughout the like the last two years i have stayed in touch with a lot of 'em and a lot of 'em are like still like good friends of mine even though they're up in like say massachusetts or in virginia but i 

172.10 184.20 B: think it's really like expanded my [noise] base of like people around that i know and like i've gotten to stay pretty close with them even though i don't like have you know a daily relationship with them or whatever 

183.61 192.13 A: uh-huh well it's nice when you're in a situation like that where you already uh have something in common uh you know it seems like um 

184.43 185.60 B: but 

189.24 191.13 B: (( yeah )) 

192.19 195.94 A: that makes it easier to get to know people and uh 

193.46 195.12 B: mhm 

195.37 201.25 B: yeah it's actually funny 'cause like in school right now i i obviously have my friends that i've 

201.28 208.21 B: known from like when i started here but pretty much my closer friends right now are my friends in my fraternity it's not like 

208.26 209.77 B: we um 

210.16 214.67 B: you know it's not like a typical friendship relations where it's just coincidental it's kinda like you just 

214.63 225.34 B: come in to that through like something else and it's sometimes on the outside it wouldn't seem like it would work but yet those are like my closest friends like the people i do spend more time with so 

227.04 228.31 B: it's kinda funny 

229.07 231.02 B: but 

231.58 232.60 B: (( i don't know )) 

234.42 236.82 B: [sigh] well my roommates right now are 

237.29 246.45 B: they're kind of like more of acquaintances when they moved in but yet we've really never become like really good good friends which is kinda weird too so 

237.36 240.31 A: (( yeah )) 

244.58 245.47 A: uh-huh 

246.78 247.98 B: i don't know 

248.20 251.75 B: i guess part of that is just living with people you don't 

252.05 253.09 B: (( i don't know )) 

252.29 254.74 A: so those are your 

255.01 260.05 A: friends because they're your roommates they're not your roommates because they're friends they they 

259.08 267.28 B: [noise] well i'd say one was a kind of a friend to start with we weren't like great friends we kind of knew each other 

267.43 273.08 B: and didn't do things together then he became my roommate another one was just um 

273.30 282.68 B: someone i really didn't know that well but we've got to become a little bit more friends but none of us are like really strong friends [noise] so that's 

283.60 293.04 B: kind of interesting i don't know what it'd be like to a room with my good good friends if we'd be getting in fights as much as i do [laughter] now or not but 

293.20 294.45 B: (( i don't know [mn] )) 

295.68 297.51 A: yeah 

299.66 300.79 B: (( but )) 

303.98 311.81 B: but i meet a lot of new people too though around like this summer i've met a new few new people 'cause like most of my 

311.84 313.95 B: friends are gone and i'm 

313.95 327.44 B: here and so i've been going out and like i've gotten to know some other people that i talk to but i don't know if that [noise] like will last like if i don't or in the fall if i'll still talk to them or not but 

327.40 330.36 B: it's always fun seeing and meeting new people 

329.64 331.04 A: [noise] oh yeah yeah i 

330.92 334.63 A: well you know i guess i found uh that 

334.61 335.45 A: it was i 

335.44 336.25 A: i met 

336.25 349.34 A: got to know a lot more people in college uh i went to a high school that was fairly big uh i think there were five hundred people in my graduating class but um didn't have a huge number of 

341.36 343.49 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

345.21 346.84 B: (( yeah )) 

349.35 360.17 A: friends in high school i guess but uh for whatever reason maybe people are older and more mature in in college uh you know made a lot more friendships in college 

353.93 355.20 B: (( oh yeah )) 

358.72 361.17 B: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

361.27 370.89 A: you know you you also get uh i guess people with a more diverse background different interests uh you know you just get people from a lot m- 

362.53 363.09 B: (( [noise] )) 

371.06 374.47 A: more different places and different backgrounds that uh 

372.63 375.14 B: (( mhm yeah mhm )) 

374.65 378.00 A: maybe lends itself to to meeting people 

379.26 382.42 B: do you still keep in contact with any high school or college friends 

382.40 392.78 A: there are a there are some actually in in college you know i went to high school with a really big uh graduating class and then in college my department was really small there were 

388.81 390.42 B: yeah 

393.23 396.14 A: um twenty people that were in my 

396.78 402.88 A: in my graduating class in my department and so i still keep in contact with some of them uh 

403.28 410.25 A: actually through work i i run across people that i uh that i know from from college too which is 

404.60 408.65 B: (( yeah huh )) 

410.44 416.77 A: which is always fun when i have to do something for work and get a chance to catch up with somebody i knew from college so 

416.10 417.84 B: yeah 

418.44 425.37 B: yeah it's kinda like for me i went to a um pretty big high school [noise] my class was about that size too but so it's uh 

425.39 429.18 B: (( kinda funny how you don't really talk to anyone from high school too much )) 

429.30 430.64 A: yeah 

430.00 432.70 B: but my 

432.90 435.06 B: (( college here is a )) 

435.13 439.66 B: it's there's like i'd say maybe five thousand on campus total but 

439.73 445.04 B: like i'm probably sure i'll keep in contact with at least my close friends here for 

445.21 447.64 B: you know a good while 

446.16 448.35 A: mhm 

447.76 449.27 B: but 

450.04 454.43 B: i guess it all depends too where you end up moving in life and stuff too 

454.28 456.08 A: yeah 

455.26 461.54 B: at this point i'm not sure where i'll be after college and i might have to start all over again [laughter] and meet new people 

461.49 466.52 A: yeah yeah it depends on where you end up and what you're doing too i guess so 

461.73 463.47 B: but 

465.28 466.51 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

468.16 478.66 A: 'cause you know i [mn] there are there are a number of people from high school around here that i guess i was friends with but i don't keep in in close contact with them 

476.95 483.89 B: (( hm [noise] yeah mhm )) 

478.81 482.32 A: probably more so uh friends from college than 

482.58 485.26 A: than high school and 

486.65 489.21 B: [lipsmack] have you always been in the same area 

489.03 490.57 A: i um 

489.23 490.99 B: (( like location area )) 

490.93 495.14 A: more or less um i went to high school here and uh 

495.35 499.73 A: went to college a couple of other places and came back here and finished here 

499.38 501.66 B: (( oh yeah )) 

500.01 503.03 A: and then uh have been here ever since so 

502.72 503.47 B: (( ha )) 

503.72 508.56 A: with the exception of about three or four years i've been in th- in this area for 

509.98 511.92 A: [mn] over twenty five years 

511.33 513.33 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

514.19 520.76 B: yeah i've pretty much been in the same location most of my life i never had to go through one of those changing school things through 

521.24 532.39 B: middle school or high school or anything i imagine that would be a little difficult so at least i got to keep you know what friends i had at the time for like my duration which was i 

532.64 534.44 A: yeah 

534.05 541.11 B: know a few people that have moved and moved but they always seem to meet some people wherever they go and make new friendships 

541.53 555.75 A: yeah i think most people do that some people just seem to naturally uh not be lacking for uh you know making new friends or you know do that very easily other people have a terrible time and i'm i'm probably somewhere in between uh 

549.22 551.06 B: yeah 

552.40 554.88 B: (( yeah it's )) 

555.18 557.05 B: (( true yeah )) 

557.94 564.21 A: you know i i find it helps a lot when you're when it's somebody you uh you know have something in common with your 

563.63 564.49 B: (( [sigh] uh-huh )) 

564.24 572.66 A: kid's on the same team or something or you know you're you're going to see the same event or you're in the same professional organization uh 

566.23 568.40 B: right 

571.79 572.85 B: (( uh-huh )) 

573.17 576.11 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

576.52 583.93 B: because i come across some people and it's like we don't have anything in common it's like well [laughter] nice talking to 

584.59 594.08 B: ya but you can tell with some people you just don't have much in common it's kinda hard it's always easier when you have that similar base of something 

588.90 589.99 A: yeah 

593.72 599.95 A: yeah yeah it is for me like i said you know some people um you know almost never meet anybody that they don't
