30.56 31.59 A: uh-huh 

32.12 33.09 A: yes 

33.07 36.50 B: (( how are are you originally from china )) 

36.49 41.21 A: originally from china no i'm not i'm originally here from the united states 

40.63 44.00 B: so you said your name was lee or something 

43.43 55.14 A: oh that's right but that's my first name my last name is puckliss and actually i'm from ah the united states but my nationality is polish and lithuanian

56.25 57.07 A: (( yeah )) 

57.74 60.91 A: so my ancestors are from slavic countries 

61.82 66.66 B: okay so what's your opinion about the subject we are supposed to talk today 

67.43 74.29 A: [noise] yes well the subject from my understanding is that other countries that may be troublesome to the united states is that correct 

73.41 76.66 B: mhm yeah that's that's right 

75.71 76.81 A: i see 

76.90 82.18 A: ah this i find it very intriguing sometimes i wonder about the country of turkey 

82.49 83.96 B: turkey 

83.29 84.17 A: yes 

84.47 88.67 B: ah i don't i don't know about turkey because i thought like ah 

88.69 102.73 B: they're they're a little more towards the united states during the war of iraq i mean it's it's just that they didn't allow the u._s. to use their air base so i don't think turkey is against the u._s. what what do you think 

102.46 103.95 A: well no 

104.02 107.35 A: i know in fact i think they're trying to enrich 

107.30 112.96 A: the relationship between turkish and american relations even more so 

112.89 122.45 A: ah and i think part of the reason for that ah which i find troubling is dealing with the kurdish population that is in that particular region 

122.09 123.30 B: mhm 

122.81 137.42 A: ah and i have concern over that and i believe the united states may have concern over it too as being troubling ah because the area is so um explosive as to what's going on 

137.32 142.17 A: um with relations with all the countries in that particular region 

142.26 143.53 A: (( and um )) 

142.56 155.71 B: yeah i yeah i agree with you it's slightly explosive but ah i dunno like how far the kurdish people are a threat to america i mean in that area i mean um 

156.23 163.46 B: okay i mean um maybe maybe ah they could destabilize the area over there yeah that's right 

162.85 165.32 A: i i'm i'm sorry what did you say 

165.13 172.64 B: ah they could be a destabilizing affect of of all the you know kurdish people just because of them yeah i think so 

172.91 177.88 B: but but what i think is um okay i agree with you 

177.89 183.78 B: but what i think is you know the the muslim countries are a little more of a threat to um 

183.95 185.23 B: america 

185.73 191.91 B: i i think ah maybe saudi arabia or you know countries like that which 

191.94 199.54 B: are a yeah you know they they support al qaeda more not not openly but ah 

199.69 202.46 B: internally so i think ah a 

202.50 208.68 B: number of the middle east countries are a real threat to america what's your opinion 

208.37 214.89 A: mhm mhm yes i believe that's the case too i have concerns about syria uh 

214.04 222.56 B: yes syria yeah actually they they are openly support um not not openly maybe maybe um 

215.44 216.40 A: (( er ah )) 

222.45 231.37 B: they i think they are they have allowed a lot of iraqi leaders to come and you know settle there hiding hide in hiding so you know my guess is 

231.45 241.76 B: um maybe saddam and most of his ah you know family must be hiding in syria i think so yeah they they are a big threat to america 

241.02 248.31 A: yes yes i do too in fact um i've had a life experience ah regarding 

246.87 247.84 B: oh really 

248.41 253.21 A: ah regarding um syria indirectly um 

253.28 264.60 A: i had been married for twenty five years and my best man at my wedding was actually um killed in the lockerbie incident of pan am 

255.63 256.40 B: oh 

263.85 266.86 B: oh the the plane crash is it oh 

265.41 266.22 A: yes 

266.62 268.22 A: flight one oh three 

268.30 269.65 A: (( and um )) 

269.99 274.46 A: ah there had been a lot of ah political issues 

274.35 288.29 A: involved with all of that and it did surface that not only libya but syria had been involved as well and i just believe that ah the country certainly harbors 

288.32 297.35 A: ah a lot of um terrorists you know issues ah over in that particular region and um 

297.41 301.73 A: ah i just don't think that it's going to stop um 

300.95 315.89 B: mhm oh yeah but but that that's right i i know syria is i mean maybe maybe openly they they support america but internally i mean they're all like muslim countries right for i mean i think like almost ninety five percent of the population is mostly muslims 

315.88 326.34 B: so obviously ah i don't and i don't think none of the muslim countries like america maybe are all against but i i was in saudi arabia for some time you know 

326.37 330.47 B: i worked there for some time so i know the general reaction actually 

330.51 343.59 B: they they like american products they like ah the li- ah the you know what what americans do they like to imitate them but in reality they don't like american people but that's the impression that i got 

343.03 347.93 A: i'm mhm and and and you've actually lived over there um 

346.72 352.07 B: yeah i lived over there for like almost two years i was working there i am a dentist by profession 

352.12 366.56 B: and i was working there as a dentist and ah so the general feeling which i got was ah they didn't they didn't ah like to include americans to come and live there or you know work there or settle there or something 

354.31 355.41 A: mhm 

366.66 374.17 B: and and even now just just see what what have happened over there they had ah a terrorist bombing in riyadh and 

374.13 388.11 B: and american government advised most its nationals to you know and you know and just leave the country so they are i think they're just trying their level best to you know destroy the americans from their country 

378.64 379.53 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

388.37 399.24 B: ah so that that's what i feel a m- derelict sorta uneducated people and they had their own views which was you know increased by all this religious 

399.24 404.23 B: people just i i dunno i i think they're like totally against americans 

404.34 407.52 B: there i had that personal feeling over there that's why 

407.14 413.34 A: mhm mhm well [mn] you know um the profession that i'm currently in 

413.26 428.25 A: um i work in a health related field as well and it deals with medical training and the particular job function that i do is i test foreign medical graduate students 

415.98 416.97 B: oh really 

419.35 420.21 B: oh 

428.28 429.44 B: oh really 

428.79 431.51 A: yes i do for certification 

431.30 432.21 B: mhm 

431.48 437.65 A: and ah for them to ah be involved here in the united states for study purposes 

437.61 448.00 A: and ah i have a range of students from all different areas of the country um and ah i by name 

447.97 457.58 A: badge for identification purposes i see that ah a a fair number are from the middle east and um 

457.61 466.30 A: i can tell that when they come to the states ah they're pretty much overwhelmed especially in the area where the the city that i work in 

466.23 467.24 B: mhm mhm 

466.31 475.77 A: and that um they're greatly impressed but at the same time i can tell that ah they the they're insecure 

476.38 479.20 A: of what we have available here 

479.57 486.58 A: and um and a lot of them do have a certain kind of attitude toward americans 

486.30 489.46 B: yeah what do you think it's like negative or positive 

490.33 501.30 A: um i think it depends on the circumstances in which they're in in a particular environment and if it's for their benefit ah 

497.13 498.03 B: (( mm mhm )) 

501.45 515.86 A: then it it becomes very positive ah but if there's concern or anxiety ah in in a social situation then um another attitude presents itself um 

514.94 515.95 B: (( i know )) 

516.01 516.91 A: (( [noise] )) 

516.04 527.48 B: [lipsmack] i agree with you i i you know i'm right now studying in the university of akron and i've got like some of my ah my classmates who are of middle east origin 

527.65 533.72 B: and ah you know ju- of- i and i here during the you know the september eleven bombing

549.51 550.45 A: yes 

552.73 559.34 B: i'm you know there there were like one or two people in the class and all the rest would be against them and you know that sort of argument involved 

559.57 568.01 B: and i maybe i don't if all the m- people from the middle east are like that but there are some elements i'm sure of that who are totally 

568.09 569.71 B: (( against america mhm )) 

568.99 571.65 A: mhm yes ah 

571.96 575.70 A: in fact i have friends who live in new york city
