181.24 194.95 A: word processors i suppose ah and typewriters and whatnot you know i my first papers were with computer and and um i they're just a tremendously helpful tool 

195.42 198.32 B: mhm i can remember my first job ah 

195.49 196.67 A: you know for 

198.43 203.97 B: i'm an engineer and we put the reports together and we'd be cutting and pasting literally you know

226.88 228.48 A: (( and ah i )) 

228.63 229.92 A: and um 

230.30 233.04 A: my gran- grandfather's office 

233.05 239.19 A: and i i remember it clearly you know the telex machine and all these you know 

239.40 240.43 A: um 

240.63 246.98 A: so much paperwork involved in like accounting and whatnot and um how much 

247.86 248.75 A: the 

249.07 254.50 A: amount of paper has has ah reduced with com- with the use of computers you know 

254.69 258.07 A: talk about you know file- files and ah 

258.22 260.03 A: and and all this 

259.72 260.98 B: that's a good point 

260.87 267.23 A: yeah it's it's hard to imagine now a world without you know all this 

267.42 272.88 A: with- without computers i mean talk about doing research you know when 

273.13 286.43 A: sure when you when you had to do research in college you know you you had to flip so many hundreds and hundreds of pages looking for stuff and now a research you know it 

286.88 294.65 A: it it when i went through college you know we were encouraged to use to go the old way also you know not to 

294.86 299.28 A: not to use computers only because it's so easy to just you know 

300.08 302.42 A: use a couple of search engines and 

302.50 303.53 A: download 

303.45 304.54 B: right 

304.23 308.04 A: tons and tons of information everything pretty much that you need 

308.29 313.65 A: so it's it's affected us so much it's it's amazing it's hard to 

314.24 319.22 A: to see a world without 'em now you know and um certainly 

317.05 317.92 B: mhm 

319.51 322.88 A: they're a tremendous help for students 

323.57 330.39 B: yeah i guess the question comes in you know to what extent do you allow or encourage students to use a computer 

330.38 340.21 B: um you know it it reminds me of the discussion when i was going through school which was you know if we let them use calculators they won't learn math well i don't that's exactly true 

338.31 339.42 A: (( right )) 

340.18 352.40 B: um and the other thing is with computers you know there may be the the issue of spell checkers and maybe kids won't learn how to spell i mean i'm i'm not a particularly good speller and i know i rely on my spell checker quite a bit 

352.47 366.35 B: but um i also try to learn from it too you know [laughter] instead of just ah letting it change the those to the correct spelling i try to say well well how do i spell that um but in terms of what you referred to in research um 

355.28 356.87 A: (( mhm mhm absolutely mhm )) 

366.37 375.38 B: [lipsmack] again my daughter was doing a paper on mother theresa and you know she got on the web and and poked around and downloaded quite a bit of information and ah 

375.91 381.82 B: yeah i think had she tried to do that at the library it would have been much more time intensive um 

382.58 389.74 B: you know then there's the other question is are we raising a generation of ah instant gratification monsters but ah 

390.62 393.08 B: oh well [laughter] 

391.87 395.76 A: yeah i think it's you know it one of those things you just you can't 

396.46 400.59 A: oh wow you know i mean you what what else what else can you do i mean 

400.68 401.55 B: right 

401.36 402.23 A: (( ah )) 

402.49 404.74 A: you you can't go you can't 

405.90 407.32 A: (( you you know go )) 

407.44 417.90 A: have extremes like i have a i have a i have a friend who um a family friends of mine who are rai- ah rearing their daughter um 

418.30 420.18 A: she's being home schooled 

420.03 421.40 B: (( okay mhm )) 

420.12 430.16 A: and they don't use televisions at all you know other for anything other than ah i mean they they only use ah 

430.04 439.95 A: they give their their television is for ah programs that ah you know that are helpful but not just watching t._v. you know 

439.23 440.20 B: mhm 

441.00 444.63 A: and um and the same with with you know so 

445.19 456.87 A: i guess you you could go that route you know you could you could go that route and not have computers at all and um and have your children grow up without 'em in this day and age but i mean 

456.70 461.68 A: why why would you i mean it's you know thi- nowadays 

461.70 465.70 A: it's like being bilingual and so many so many um 

465.99 467.32 A: states 

467.50 481.87 A: in the united states it's almost it's a requirement in many states and it's getting their being bilingual's sp- meaning spanish and english and ah it's getting there in so many more states well 

482.28 483.71 A: now if you don't 

484.45 491.79 A: have you know m- more than basic knowledge of computers you know who's going to hire you i mean it's just 

491.91 494.42 A: if you can't operate you know um 

494.85 497.45 A: microsoft word you know 

497.41 510.96 A: what what jobs just about and and ah and and and pretty much every field doesn't doesn't include some use of computers you know even the most technical technical ah jobs 

511.65 512.64 A: so 

511.77 517.30 B: it's funny the other day our ah internet connection was down at work and ah 

517.87 525.03 B: it pretty much brought us to our knees you know because so much of what we do it ah communicating through email and ah 

520.08 520.95 A: (( yeah )) 

525.66 529.36 B: you know i do a lot of research stuff on the web and it was just like 

529.63 538.61 B: man [laughter] lost connection but well that that really talks to our vulnerability in terms of our dependence on it but um 

530.75 532.06 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

539.39 545.01 B: again it it is here and it is part of our way of life and i think our 

546.03 551.03 B: our youth need to be educated on it and this is just like ah anything else 

550.96 553.71 A: yeah it's it really is amazing i um 

553.78 558.45 A: it being er here in atlanta the the college that i attended [lipsmack] 

558.77 565.21 A: was one of the first colleges in the states to include a um computer 

565.31 572.68 A: per student so you were you paid it with your tuition and at the time it was it was so innovated you know i'd 

566.64 567.59 B: oh yeah 

572.74 575.14 A: be online and ah 

575.83 582.20 A: chatting with with the pers- with a friend who was say in miami and um 

582.19 592.01 A: you know it was hard for them to understand that i was in class [laughter] you know i was in in my classroom at the moment like are you kidding me right you know 

589.00 590.34 B: (( [sigh] [laughter] )) 

592.35 593.51 A: so it's 

593.60 599.95 A: that's that really blew my mind when i when it got to that point where you could you could actually surf
