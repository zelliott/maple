0.78 1.93 A: hello 

2.86 4.16 A: yeah i'm vince 

3.76 4.89 B: i'm lisa 

5.03 6.19 A: nice to meet you 

5.85 10.86 B: nice to meet you you know i didn't really um i went in to hang up the phone so i didn't get the full topic 

11.22 21.81 A: what do we feel uh is the situation in the middle east do you think the u._s. remain there or uh should we oh 

22.95 24.79 A: the situation in the middle east 

23.80 26.62 B: [noise] oh okay okay great 

26.71 28.38 B: well how do you feel about that 

28.64 32.37 A: uh me personally i mean there's really two paths 

32.50 35.27 A: um there's been problems in the middle east 

35.29 40.91 A: for thousands of years now and i don't think the united states is going to solve the problem 

41.03 42.42 A: on the one hand 

41.45 42.43 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

43.48 45.95 A: [cough] and also 

46.05 49.44 A: we can't really expect to police the world 

49.65 50.65 A: (( you know )) 

50.74 59.68 A: but then on the other hand we have interest in the middle east and we have to as a sovereign nation we have to protect our interests 

60.22 62.82 A: so that means having a presence there 

64.13 65.68 A: what do you think 

64.91 75.23 B: well i have a husband that's in the reserves and he's leaving for active duty starting next friday so i personally don't believe we should be there 

68.10 69.04 A: (( yeah )) 

70.04 70.72 A: (( mhm )) 

75.70 82.82 B: um you know i know we have interests over there but sometimes our interests aren't as deep as our activities there 

83.32 86.31 B: i think sometimes we seem to butt in 

86.76 89.53 A: [laughter] 

86.92 90.70 B: where it's not really needed personally 

90.08 91.46 A: (( yeah well )) 

90.71 92.71 B: you know i have you know i 

92.80 95.42 B: i don't i don't feel we should have been in the 

95.48 96.86 B: the war there 

97.03 108.09 B: i'm not i believe we need to step in the palestine and israeli conflict maybe a little more but not go to war with anybody over there 

107.80 108.58 A: (( oh )) 

108.99 110.43 A: well i mean 

110.79 112.22 A: if we uh 

113.69 116.40 A: you wanna pay four dollars a gallon 

116.31 118.01 B: yeah but you know the 

116.54 119.38 A: is that what you're talking about there 

118.44 121.92 B: the amount of oil we actually receive form iraq 

122.23 123.90 B: is very little 

124.08 127.44 B: other countries supply us with a lot more oil than they do 

127.81 131.05 B: so i don't really think that that's a valid point 

131.04 136.38 A: well i'm not you know i'm not arguing with you i'm just playing devil's advocate you know what i mean 

132.27 134.21 B: i think if we are attacked 

134.92 138.44 B: yeah i think if we're attacked we need to 

139.36 142.93 B: defend us i i will agree if we are attacked 

143.14 144.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

143.38 146.12 B: like the um whole incident with the um 

146.28 148.13 B: world trade center and 

148.47 151.59 B: that kind of thing we do need to find to um 

152.07 158.56 B: fight back then but you know really our terror level hasn't gone down any with the war in afghanistan and the war in iraq 

158.29 161.42 A: well actually we are down to uh 

161.56 165.43 A: uh elevated now i think there's six levels 

163.28 168.52 B: yeah but you know next week it goes right back up to orange so i don't know thin we really 

166.66 172.61 A: right well let me ask you this you don't think that the al qaeda and uh certain uh 

172.76 175.34 A: saddam hussein uh 

176.06 187.52 A: backing and having political ties with these terrorist groups you don't think that that is a reason i mean if you take the money away from the terrorists they don't have the 

187.48 192.28 A: uh financial backing to pull off something like nine eleven 

192.61 193.62 A: so 

194.39 198.57 A: you don't think that that is a good reason for us to have a pre- presence 

194.41 195.48 B: i think 

198.04 211.52 B: i think there was a way to get saddam hussein without going sending thousands of troops over there and losing a hundred and what thirty american lives i think there was a way to deal with him outside that 

210.90 212.03 A: oh 

211.88 213.42 B: that you know i i 

212.46 213.83 A: okay what's the way 

213.70 228.23 B: i would have done [noise] i mean we have the c._i._a. and other things [noise] and here we keep we kept saying we got him on this attack and we got him on that attack and he's probably still alive so what did we really accomplish [noise] i mean he's out of [noise] power for running that country 

224.94 226.14 A: oh 

228.70 233.78 B: but who's to say he's not going to appear somewhere else or he's still not um 

234.24 239.32 B: masterminding other plans we really didn't accomplish anything except getting him out of power 

236.00 236.93 A: (( uh-huh )) 

239.43 240.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

239.91 241.28 A: well i mean 

241.64 246.50 A: you don't think that that in itself was a uh a good thing i mean 

246.51 250.92 A: with saddam hussein in power he could be given money to 

251.08 262.44 A: al qaeda type terrorist organizations and when they don't have his support you know it it puts a real damper on their ability to attack us 

262.15 265.54 B: well i don't think we know that he's not still giving them support 

262.76 263.67 A: so 

265.69 269.30 A: well he's not as public as he was and 

267.60 275.09 B: right but we really didn't accomplish getting taking care of him yet and we really didn't accomplish getting osama bin laden we're not sure 

275.32 280.82 A: well i mean he's in hiding and even if he's not uh 

276.41 278.45 B: (( so it seems a lot of right )) 

281.06 289.08 A: i mean maybe he is somewhere in the background but he's certainly not the public figure and certainly not in the same position of power that he was in 

289.34 290.61 A: so i mean 

290.69 298.64 A: there's no easy answer and this is definitely a loaded subject you know and i mean you i can tell that you have your own 

294.89 296.08 B: yeah 

298.41 299.38 B: right 

298.64 312.33 A: set of values with your family member being in harm's way and uh you know i i pray him i really hope everything's all right but i think that you know there's a lot of 

312.41 317.20 A: it's more it's deeper than what you and i will discuss you know [laughter] 

315.03 316.25 B: (( [noise] right )) 

316.32 327.64 B: right and that's why i think it could do deeper on getting people out of power than maybe the united states needs to look at rather than attacking a whole country maybe you just need to attack one or two people 

327.58 328.62 A: mhm 

328.42 337.83 B: i the i felt like you know why why couldn't um the united states get someone in there to do away with hussein without attacking the whole country 

338.07 350.50 A: well if you're talking about some kind of covert operation i think the bay of pigs uh uh in cuba had something to do with that we as a as a sovereign nation we don't go after 

350.55 353.71 A: uh heads of other nations 

354.24 358.01 B: you know but maybe we need to look at changing those thoughts 

354.26 355.66 A: you know so 

357.36 360.91 A: those ideas maybe and maybe i mean 

358.37 362.21 B: yeah because when you know when you had bay of pigs you didn't have other 

362.34 365.01 B: individuals coming over here and destroying 

365.62 374.13 B: trying to destroy us in the way they are now so i think you have to look at other ways to achieve things than the way we used to do it 

374.24 375.28 B: also 

375.09 376.14 A: mhm 

376.29 386.05 A: well uh what what would you what do you think would happen if we if it came to that position if they had gotten into a position where 

386.82 389.01 A: we uh 

389.60 396.19 A: kill with extreme prejudice we send in the c._i._a. or some some team of experts to go in and kill their 

396.26 401.12 A: their president who's to say that they wouldn't do the same to ours [noise] 

401.00 405.23 B: [noise] [noise] well that that's true but who's to say they're not gonna do that anyway 

404.96 407.86 A: (( [laughter] yeah [noise] )) 

406.00 410.12 B: you know i mean no-one can say what would happen or what's not gonna happen 

411.08 420.27 A: you know what i think a lot of the time the guy that's on the front page of the news [noise] is not necessarily the guy that's in power there's always somebody behind the throne you know what i mean 

420.16 426.20 A: that's pulling the strings [noise] so it's not necessarily that's not going to solve the problem 

421.94 422.77 B: right 

423.58 425.34 B: that's why i don't think he's 

425.57 430.54 B: right him alone wasn't gonna do it i think there was having to be some other individuals go with him 

430.60 432.88 A: maybe a whole network probably mhm 

431.01 431.91 B: but 

432.13 435.89 B: yeah but i don't think attacking the whole country 

435.57 436.69 A: [noise] 

436.28 439.53 B: um to get a few people was the answer 

436.91 438.09 A: [noise] 

439.44 440.85 A: [noise] mhm 

440.02 444.56 B: and you know all we heard was these m- um weapons of mass destruction 

441.90 443.24 A: [noise] 

444.86 447.72 B: i still don't think they found any evidence that they were 

447.84 455.36 B: they're there now they may have been there at some point but i don't know if we ever found i don't think if they haven't found 'em yet they're not gonna find 'em 

449.08 449.95 A: mhm 

455.76 457.56 A: well i mean 

457.83 465.49 A: look at osama bin laden like you said he hasn't wanna been found and he's sending out tapes here there and everywhere 

465.58 466.87 A: right so 

465.96 467.64 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

467.13 469.28 A: he's probably alive somewhere 

469.06 469.84 B: yeah 

469.49 470.49 A: i mean 

471.72 473.97 A: i don't know it's definitely for 

474.92 479.49 A: there's no easy answer i think on the one hand 

477.11 480.47 B: yeah yeah i don't think there's an easy answer either 

480.31 481.98 A: on the one hand 

482.40 486.84 A: we have issues that we we have our our our 

487.70 497.51 A: own ideas of what we need to have as far as the position in the middle east protected and on the one hand and then on the other hand you know 

497.54 502.78 A: is there an easier way a more peaceful a more way to 

502.80 505.82 A: get those the ends to those needs you know 

506.57 508.42 A: and i mean 

508.81 518.92 A: we could all take we could all take a page out of martin luther king's non aggressive passive change but i mean osama bin laden 

519.27 527.66 A: was the type of guy that you know he mil- he murdered his own people you know for his own ends hello 

526.97 528.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] yes )) 

528.19 529.94 A: (( yeah so i mean )) 

530.00 532.48 A: do you really think diplomatic 

532.57 536.44 A: intervention is gonna have any effect on a man like that 

536.43 544.55 B: [noise] well i just don't think [noise] that if we're attacked we should respond but if not i don't really think 

544.68 548.59 B: and the people of iraq didn't really attack us 

549.13 552.78 B: [noise] so i don't really see much need for us to have been there 

553.87 555.08 B: i just 

555.13 558.28 B: i just don't see it i don't think we had enough evidence 

558.55 565.59 B: that he had mass weapons of mass destruction and that's what our government was using as the reason for attacking them 

565.70 569.40 A: well that wasn't the only reason actually 

565.85 567.48 B: was the weapons 

567.88 571.80 B: but that was one of the reason why they got the u._n. resolution 

569.52 571.90 A: it it was one and they 

572.46 578.38 A: it was one of the reasons and uh from what i've read they have found uh 

578.55 582.25 A: things that are on the trail of them leading to 

582.60 593.61 A: uh we don't know that they hadn't destroyed their weapons of mass destruction before they we even got in there so but we have found evidence that they were working on those types of things 

586.02 586.88 B: right 

588.05 588.87 B: right 

593.17 599.95 B: right but i think if they had 'em we would have found them by now i mean they're tearing up that country trying to find them to prove 

593.70 596.11 A: (( and [cough] )) 

597.48 598.38 A: (( yeah ))
