14.95 19.91 A: oh probably yes the middle east about the peace process [cough] 

19.67 22.10 B: mhm 

21.28 23.68 A: so what do you think about it 

23.48 25.05 B: well 

25.86 27.55 B: i think peace 

27.80 33.03 B: is a well personally peace is something that everybody wants 

33.20 33.88 A: (( mhm )) 

33.24 41.62 B: nobody knows how to achieve it because everybody has different opinions on it what about yourself wh- wh- wh- what do you think of it 

37.17 37.81 A: (( mhm )) 

39.03 39.91 A: but 

41.42 53.47 A: well that is one thing usually even though what i think myself even we have different opinion about peace today something we call compromise because 

53.44 58.94 A: then nobody is going to get everything you want out of life right 

58.59 65.82 B: and that's true you know and there's got to be a middle ground you know and you have to be willing to meet that middle ground and uh 

60.96 62.46 A: (( yeah )) 

64.22 65.76 A: you bet yeah 

65.93 67.85 B: i don't know i think that 

68.07 75.25 B: everybody has their differences okay but no-one should be allowed to force their opinion on someone else 

75.23 77.61 A: (( i would think that too yeah )) 

77.11 81.51 B: it seems like people with one opinion and people that feel that way should be together 

81.56 86.71 B: and with another opinion should be together and then let live and let live you know let the people who have 

86.75 93.04 B: well we all have free will so those who w- want one thing in one way and i'm happy that way i mean 

93.10 94.52 B: like i feel that 

94.78 97.97 B: certain people trying to force their opinions on others 

96.80 98.30 A: (( hm )) 

98.60 108.44 A: (( so what do you think uh first of all myself i know if we want to go down to history about you know about )) 

108.48 110.11 A: (( palestine )) 

110.12 119.22 A: was there before even the you know israel itself came to be about right 

118.71 124.48 B: well um if i'm not mistaken israel was founded in nineteen forty eight 

123.66 125.54 A: yeah nineteen forty eight 

124.56 130.92 B: but they found a place for the for their for the jews to take call their homeland i don't think that 

127.22 128.36 A: mhm 

128.87 129.87 A: yeah 

131.89 132.95 B: okay when 

133.25 136.76 B: okay just like i don't know where you living now america 

136.43 137.53 A: yeah 

136.93 138.43 B: where you live at 

138.16 140.55 A: uh in florida 

140.09 142.44 B: okay do you own your home 

142.05 143.15 A: mhm 

142.90 148.79 B: how would you feel if somebody came and said look we gonna take half of your background and move these people in 

148.84 151.66 B: okay and you don't have no say about it okay 

151.29 152.01 A: (( that's )) 

151.60 153.78 B: that's kinda bad i mean 

153.66 155.80 B: it's done and it's done 

155.67 163.42 B: but israel is i mean i'm not trying to be [noise] prejudice one way or the other but it seems to me that the way it was done was wrong 

163.18 170.82 B: these people should have been asked will you accept these people as part of your country you know you can't just say okay this is it this is what it's gonna be that's just like 

167.50 168.19 A: (( bad )) 

171.44 177.19 B: that's just like i guess you call a kind of take over somebody's land you know without their say so 

175.81 183.27 A: yeah so yeah i can i can understand that too but the what i am trying to make myself 

183.35 196.58 A: if israel themself why make them think that they can be you know whenever something happened you know you know things happen in a lot of countries all right but whenever 

194.88 195.78 B: yeah 

196.62 202.76 A: happened and they go and kind of barricade or you know bulldoze 

202.56 214.40 A: everything you know the other people up and i wonder how would that be any time it's because they have more arms and you know everything more uh 

213.66 228.16 B: [noise] well i think that okay is- israel through history well i'm going back to like christianity now they they they they came they they're supposed to be the chosen people 

215.73 223.70 A: hm 

228.26 236.56 B: i don't think that's right i think that they kept good records that's why they had the bible they kept good records of what their people went through right 

236.55 240.83 B: and they feel that the united states is going to back them at anything they do 

240.83 245.86 B: so they have the power of the united states at their back door okay 

243.59 246.44 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

245.74 260.28 B: it's not that they're powerful i mean i mean they have a little power okay no problem but they got the power of the united states backing them so everything they do the united states is basically gonna come in and help them out they feel that way so you know it causes a lot of pressure 

260.15 262.28 B: and the people in palestine 

262.36 263.22 A: mhm 

262.67 276.77 B: i mean they've been fighting for so many years now they should realize i mean like the war doesn't help anybody you know people getting killed on both sides it cause heartache and problem on both sides somewhere somebody has to try to come in and make a compromise but 

276.82 283.09 B: the people who are trying to make a compromise like the talks that they had at camp david i think when jimmy carter was president i'm not sure who it was 

282.95 285.06 A: yeah mhm 

283.38 284.50 B: uh 

284.42 288.97 B: they had the heads of states there right but they can't make decisions for 

286.84 287.77 A: yeah 

288.89 291.71 B: (( everybody okay because then you're gonna have your )) 

291.54 293.58 B: if for example if 

293.41 307.35 B: i make a decision for you and you don't like that decision you gonna go and do something else okay so you're gonna have your little off shoot rebel groups that are going to be completely against it so like i say it's gotta be compromise somewhere how i can't answer that question 

296.72 299.19 A: (( hm mhm yeah yeah oh yeah i would )) 

301.78 302.92 A: mhm 

307.03 314.63 A: what do you think it would be i don't think myself what i am thinking i don't think it's so would you think if 

314.65 319.80 A: (( uh united states was like you know that impartial )) 

319.81 324.22 A: instead of like trying to you know uh [mn] 

324.92 328.80 A: like being the favor you know favor one side 

327.10 330.61 B: well okay let's put it this way you say the united states 

330.22 331.27 A: yeah 

330.76 339.10 B: okay we're talking about the people who make decisions for the united states because there are a lot of people in the united states who don't care one way or less okay 

338.12 340.98 A: (( yeah that's that's what i think too but )) 

339.16 344.61 B: [laughter] okay you got the people who are in power making these decisions and it's all about dollar bills okay 

343.87 357.04 A: well well since we are talking about the head whenever you are in a country whether we like it or not as you say you know people make decisions but we have to live by whatever they say 

355.79 363.35 B: no that's not true that is not true in america we elect representatives to represent us okay we have to 

357.13 358.14 A: (( oh mhm mhm )) 

360.77 370.21 A: hm 

363.32 368.29 B: make those representatives responsible to us they make decisions that they've seen fit 

368.06 381.31 B: but the people who put them in office can always say look this is how we want it to be done and they have to go by that majority decision but the people don't do that the people don't hold their representatives accountable they just put them up there and they don't make the decisions okay 

381.30 385.63 B: but you from florida you have a a a congressman and a senator there 

385.49 396.80 B: you've got enough people from your state talking to your councilman and say look we want you to vote this way on this particular subject he has to vote that way you can remove him from o- o- office and put somebody in that will vote the way you want 'em 

385.49 386.37 A: (( yes mhm )) 

396.19 401.35 A: yeah but usually you don't see these people until it's time for election again 

400.66 406.65 B: uh yeah because you don't hold them accountable you go about your life they go about their life 

404.95 405.95 A: yeah 

406.23 407.38 A: mhm 

406.55 415.89 B: everybody's object in life is self preservation and that person that you put in office is going to do what's best for him what's gonna keep him surviving okay 

415.58 418.27 A: (( so where are you from yourself where do you live )) 

417.15 420.51 B: i live in washington d._c. right here at the head of con- i'm i'm about 

420.22 421.88 A: oh so you are 

420.75 423.91 B: i'm about twenty minutes from the capital and the white house 

423.25 426.17 A: so you are close to the action huh [laughter] oh 

425.23 432.66 B: no because i don't get involved in it you know that's their problem okay i'm much too busy trying to survive from day to day okay 

426.19 430.62 A: (( hm )) 

431.68 442.73 A: yeah this is the that's the problem you know like like you said you elect you voted for somebody and you don't see that person and they keep making decision which you 

441.43 446.38 B: you don't hold them accountable you don't make them accountable to you you just let them do what they wish to do 

446.39 457.00 B: you know and there is also lobby- lobbyists that go around and pay people to vote certain ways okay so it's all about money okay that's the bottom line 

451.02 454.06 A: (( hm )) 

455.43 464.94 A: well it is and that's what it is and it's very sad because these people you picture what happened in uh the september eleventh right 

464.41 465.46 B: right 

464.75 471.60 A: (( and since that happened we all been being on our toes and even to think you know )) 

470.48 479.99 B: no no no that's not right we all have not been our toes see you can only speak for yourself i have gone about living my life the same way i did before september eleventh 

472.07 473.07 A: mhm 

476.06 476.92 A: (( yeah )) 

478.70 484.81 A: oh you did so you you don't you don't really care one way or the other and 

482.75 496.79 B: no i care i sympathize with the people that got hurt and got killed okay but i can't stop and watch every human being on the planet and say is this person a terrorist i have to go on living the way i did in the past okay so i've got to live from day to day 

486.64 488.02 A: mhm 

496.77 501.74 B: (( for example the united states has been l- looking for osama bin laden since then they haven't found him yet okay )) 

500.84 502.07 A: mhm 

501.76 511.03 B: i mean i we got a system here a subway anybody at any give time on that train could be a a terrorist you have no idea what a terrorist looks like 

508.79 510.04 A: yeah 

510.38 512.57 A: oh no you don't because they 

511.51 523.36 B: so why should i worry about everybody on this planet i gotta keep living the way i've lived all the time because i believe in a a supreme being and when my time comes it'll come regardless of how it comes okay 

522.46 535.74 A: well let's lets say if you were living in one of those countries in the middle east and the peace process was going so slow and things happen like every single second and minute would you have this same attitude you're having now 

530.88 531.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

535.30 538.01 B: i can't say that because i'm not in the situation 

537.01 547.93 A: (( hm )) 

538.22 545.76 B: humans are a product of their environments okay and you adjust to your environment just like a comedian adjusts to his surroundings okay 

545.64 555.74 B: i can't say what i would do if i'm not there okay all i know is that i have to take care of me and i have to keep on doing things that i'd do to keep me surviving okay 

555.80 565.87 B: so i can't be i can't be worried about other things that are going on i mean you you know about 'em you can't help but know about 'em and you be concerned about 'em but you can't worry about 'em [laughter] 

563.55 564.73 A: (( mhm mhm okay mhm but )) 

565.22 578.18 A: so let's say if you were like you know let's say if you were the head and you were dealing with the peace process let's say that you were an elected official for example and you were responsible for that peace process 

578.08 580.57 A: what would you do then yourself 

580.78 582.67 A: since you said you 

581.26 590.44 B: i would say okay if i was talking to the other head of the country i would sit down and say now look what are your concerns okay what do you want okay and then i'd find out and i'd say now 

591.04 599.89 B: let's come to a an agreement that we both can live with so we'll have a win win situation but we may make agreement that his people don't agree with okay so what's 

598.92 599.95 A: (( uh-huh ))
