0.56 4.41 A: good evening my name's uh rodolfo romero and i'm calling from california 

6.25 9.23 B: [noise] hi this is brandon can you hear me 

8.61 9.69 A: yes i could 

9.39 16.04 B: uh i didn't hear a a tone but i i guess i'm supposed to talk now i've never done this these things before but it seemed like an interesting thing to try out [noise] 

16.10 19.69 A: okay yeah i've i did this one time i did it earlier in the week 

19.32 20.17 B: uh-huh 

19.99 22.92 A: yeah so uh which state are you calling from 

22.47 25.19 B: i'm calling from california as well i live in northern california 

24.77 28.86 A: okay i live in southern california i guess to yeah i guess 

26.61 27.46 B: (( uh we're )) 

27.88 29.43 B: got a nice selection then huh 

29.29 30.22 A: yes 

30.28 36.28 A: i guess today's topic was if i heard correctly was out- if you prefer outdoor activities or indoor activities 

35.69 44.91 B: yeah that's a it's a good thing to talk about we're right now i just got out from got i got back home from shopping and it is drizzling and it's about fifty five degrees here in the san francisco area 

44.56 45.61 A: oh wow 

45.15 49.56 B: so uh i'm thinking [laughter] right now indoor activities are probably a better thing to do 

49.63 58.55 A: yes it is um in most cases yeah in most cases i guess i i prefer outdoor activities i like playing basketball i jog and i like you know hanging out at the beach 

50.56 51.38 B: [laughter] 

51.50 52.35 B: (( but uh )) 

54.64 55.41 B: uh-huh 

58.28 66.22 B: uh-huh definitely yeah i i think i prefer outdoor activities as well though though today i think a nice game of scrabble and a a cup of coffee would probably be good for this kind of day 

59.04 59.83 A: so 

66.04 67.44 A: oh okay that's true 

66.61 71.92 B: but uh yeah i do i do a little bit of hiking whenever i can uh can find the time and uh i mountain bike 

71.47 80.04 A: okay that's something i don't do i don't hike or mountain bike i just like you know being out there the general sports you know i like to play basketball jogging volleyball at the beach things like that yeah 

75.97 76.78 B: uh-huh 

80.06 86.18 B: my my idea is to uh to try to get as much um you know as much distance in as possible see as much scenery that kind of thing 

86.20 94.35 B: so it's why i like mountain biking i can you know there's some great trails in uh northern california i can get a long long way see some lakes some streams some hills get a lot of scenery in 

94.90 100.32 A: yeah well normally i prefer i outdoor activity 'cause they tend to be uh better exercise you know it's 

95.52 96.80 B: so that's the benefit of 

100.03 102.13 B: absolutely yeah 

101.15 108.77 A: yeah you know yes some wonderful indoor activity like pool or chess or other stuff like that but uh when it comes to exercise you can't beat outdoor activities 

108.51 116.35 B: i i guess the question is uh indoor activities seem to be activities geared towards your uh your mental exercise and outdoor activities are more the physical exercise 

116.20 120.04 A: exactly yeah so 'cause we're all a little more health conscious nowadays 

119.79 129.11 B: uh-huh yeah exactly yeah it's good it's good to be healthy [laughter] i i need to do a little more outdoor activity i've been uh i've been spending a lot of time working on my house and uh 

121.37 122.57 A: yeah 

123.37 124.82 A: [laughter] that's true it 

129.21 132.46 B: [sigh] gardening has been a big outdoor activity as well 

132.07 142.24 A: all depends uh i guess what part of the country you're living at we're blessed in california you can do you can do outdoor activities like twelve months of the year in certain parts of certain parts of the country uh 

139.66 141.35 B: yeah 

142.91 147.65 A: you can uh do some i guess well i take that back you can ski that's an outdoor activity okay 

147.02 147.95 B: this is true 

147.76 150.54 A: go for the warm and cold weather kind of stuff but yeah 

150.38 151.23 B: (( yeah but )) 

151.27 157.89 B: california the great thing about california you can you can do two outdoor activities you can you can surf in the morning and then drive to the mountains and go skiing all in the same day 

157.69 159.79 A: exactly and everything in between 

158.42 163.16 B: and that's the beauty of california yeah precisely now wh- what part of southern california do you live in 

163.07 164.71 A: i live in honeystone park 

165.02 166.13 A: that's basic- 

165.22 167.30 B: and what pa- what park is it again 

167.17 171.55 A: no honeystone park that's basically um um the l._a. area 

170.98 176.65 B: okay yeah i i grew up in uh in newport beach and and glendale and uh and i i went to school at u._s._c. 

176.15 178.23 A: [mn] oh wow oh i 

177.01 178.27 B: so i had a 

178.55 183.38 A: went to school at cal state long beach what made you what made you decide to go up to northern california 

180.15 181.12 B: (( oh cool )) 

183.27 185.10 B: uh i got a job up here [laughter] 

184.66 186.22 A: [laughter] okay that's 

185.48 191.82 B: i i'm a journalist so i uh i've i've worked in all kinds of different places and i worked in tucson and and phoenix and uh now i work here 

191.65 194.11 A: oh wow that's you'd see the country then 

191.96 193.10 B: but 

193.85 199.10 B: yeah exactly and and i guess we're supposed to i i don't know how these things go i guess we're supposed to try to stay on topic as much as possible huh 

198.53 199.75 A: yeah exactly 

199.65 207.66 B: right so so i i'll tell you about the outdoor activity i i do in the bay area i uh i got a an eleven foot sailboat that was in my family forever and i uh 

199.84 200.81 A: um 

207.52 217.87 B: it's about thirty years old and i i fixed it up and [laughter] and re-fiberglassed parts of it and i've been trying to get out on the bay a few times and and enjoy it although the weather's been not exactly cooperating with me on that [laughter] 

217.67 218.74 A: okay 

219.34 220.50 A: yeah 

220.17 224.79 B: but it's a sail i i guess you if you're into basketball that kind of stuff you're probably into the team sports huh 

224.38 235.28 A: yeah basically team sports exactly you know softball you name it a- any kind of sports i like to watch you know i like i enjoy playing it it's wonder exercise it's great with you know meet people stay in shape just 

230.58 231.47 B: mhm 

234.29 244.35 B: yeah that that's the one thing i miss about like mountain biking and sailing [mn] if you notice [laughter] all all the sports i listed i don't know i don't know what it says about me but it seems like all the sports i listed [laughter] su- suggested i like to be alone [laughter] 

243.71 245.82 A: exactly [laughter] individuals 

244.64 247.57 B: but it's not true actually i i enjoy doing them with other people 

247.46 255.34 A: yeah with the exception of jogging i don't do anything alone you know i don't like i don't surf i don't mountain bike i don't or things like that it's always team sports 

252.54 253.35 B: uh-huh 

255.13 264.94 B: yeah i guess the one the one thing i have uh you know after moving to different places i don't have a uh you know my core group of friends they all live in southern california so if i you know i gotta gotta make new friends to do things up here 

255.39 256.12 A: so 

264.93 266.43 A: [laughter] that's true 

265.46 274.83 B: and uh so far i haven't found new friends that are into my outdoor activities they're uh they're [laughter] all working on their houses so i guess i guess that we're all working on our houses and gardening and no one wants to help each other [laughter] 

274.81 280.24 A: have have the activities changed from southern california northern california in terms of your what you like doing in the outdoors 

280.03 289.72 B: yeah well i bought a um i we got a house up here so once once i did that it pretty much [laughter] there was no more mountain biking it was more uh working in the garden and painting the outside of the house and uh [sigh] 

289.89 296.71 B: you know just doing all that manual labor [laughter] on the yard which is it's good exercise it it's kind of fun to have a yard and that kind of thing but 

296.60 308.46 B: i i do miss you know being able to just kinda get away and you know ride the bike up the mountain and uh get a- get away from people and and everything and kinda i guess it's a little bit of a a philosophical thing you know to uh 

308.32 311.93 B: just kinda free your mind of all the stress and all the stuff you have at home 

311.85 313.39 A: yeah yeah that that is another way 

314.03 315.07 B: yeah 

314.87 320.43 A: stress and just go back to nature and just forget about the nine to five grind in most cases for most people 

318.59 332.97 B: mm exactly exactly now in l._a. actually i did a lot more um you know team sports i played a lot of tennis in l._a. and i i actually i used to go mountain biking with my brother in law in l._a. too and i go hiking with friends and rock climbing with friends [laughter] up here i'm as i say i'm still trying to find the uh 

332.91 335.08 B: (( trying to find a group of people that'll do that )) 

333.03 333.70 A: whe- 

334.48 337.37 A: where do you go hiking in southern california where do you prefer to go 

336.15 341.69 B: i used to go to angel's crest all the time um like up up to the the top there where the observatory is above angel's crest 

337.99 338.76 A: (( okay )) 

341.08 342.78 A: (( yeah park )) 

342.60 354.13 B: yeah exactly that all all those areas they're they're all pretty good areas then um we went down to orange county a few times like corona del mar we'd we go rock climbing on the there's a big rock site by the uh the jetties going into newport beach harbor 

353.54 354.56 A: (( yeah yes )) 

354.38 358.07 B: so we we go rock climbing there and rappelling off the uh the rocks there 

358.20 359.11 A: oh wow 

358.60 361.39 B: but that that was a long long time ago [laughter] 

360.99 362.23 A: yeah i would imagine yeah 

361.99 367.93 B: yeah i'm i i don't think i could quite handle [laughter] that today i don't know if i'm in as good a shape as i used to be back then either 

368.05 373.65 A: how long it take for a person who's starting off rock climbing to come adj- to become adjusted and learn how to rock climb 

373.83 377.25 B: you know i i kind of just jumped into it i mean i i have a friend um 

377.15 387.46 B: he's i i had a friend in high school and he uh he's still a friend now but he's uh he's in the army or the navy i mean he works with special forces and he was always uh the extreme sports kinda guy 

384.08 384.82 A: yes 

387.19 387.98 A: yes 

387.35 389.97 B: he would he would get us into all kinds of crazy things 

389.77 399.75 B: and uh we'd go rappelling with him and rock climbing and he took lessons and he kinda showed us a little bit but basically it was it was relatively simple i mean we he showed us some basic techniques and and from then on we 

399.56 409.27 B: we kind of run it on and we we learned pretty quickly on the [laughter] you know on the mountain how to do it but i did have a friend who was kind of un- uncoordinated actually a friend of mine who went to cal state long beach 

404.24 405.29 A: (( okay so )) 

409.23 417.92 B: [laughter] and uh he he had a little bit of trouble with adjusting to the rock climbing so he he would basically like hike up and then then he would rappel down the mountain as opposed to trying to climb up the mountain 

409.68 410.49 A: yeah 

417.69 423.54 A: okay so i guess the learning curve isn't uh too difficult as long as you're in pretty good shape and you're pretty coordinated and 

422.92 427.70 B: yeah exactly exactly if you if you have kind of good sense of balance and that kind of thing 

428.48 429.47 A: (( yeah okay yeah i )) 

428.62 438.01 B: it was a it was a good experience we had we had a lot of fun doing that we i guess when you when you save your friend's life and you [laughter] 'cause 'cause you're about to fall off a mountain it's a it's a good way to bond with your friends 

438.36 441.01 A: think also there there's also an increased uh 

441.06 449.64 A: participation in some outdoor activities 'cause because of the extreme sports you see on t._v. you know you have a lot of extreme sports on e._s._p._n. and things like that and i guess people 

445.16 446.01 B: mhm 

447.84 450.05 B: yeah and it there's an extreme sports network too 

449.91 453.37 A: yeah exactly and people see that they get excited and go out there and try 

453.41 457.42 B: [laughter] yeah and then then they break their leg and [laughter] and fall off a mountain 

453.48 455.00 A: try different stuff 

455.49 456.93 A: [laughter] 

457.26 467.09 A: yeah that's true but they're out there trying now and uh yeah so that that increases the popularity which is good it it helps people stay in shape and be out there out in the world doing stuff 

462.44 463.03 B: (( mm )) 

466.30 479.82 B: absolutely you know also i think i think you got a good point because it opens up kind of a new world of of outdoor activity a lot of people they maybe they're not into to team sports or they maybe they're not good at basketball but if they see all these other sports out there that you know rock climbing and kayaking and mountain biking and all that stuff they 

473.93 474.77 A: yes 

479.66 481.90 B: they can find something that'll that'll fit them better 

481.80 484.16 A: and skateboarding you know snow 

483.13 487.92 B: yeah exactly yeah i i was never good at skateboarding or snowboarding [laughter] 

484.34 485.51 A: snowboarding 

487.53 502.48 A: yeah i i i was a skater when i was a kid for a long yeah for a long time uh it seemed like people in the neighborhood no longer uh skateboarded but in the last five or six years it seemed like everybody starts skateboarding little kids so it it seemed like that's back in style big time last few years 

489.98 490.90 B: (( were ya huh )) 

495.55 496.27 B: really 

498.84 500.63 B: mhm 

502.35 510.23 B: yeah it's kinda i guess it comes and goes you know rollerblading was was big for a while and that kinda replaced skateboards i think then you had those those scooters that were big and popular 

505.60 506.45 A: yeah 

507.17 508.41 A: exactly but 

510.03 511.77 A: yeah so 

511.75 513.53 B: (( uh can i ask how old you are )) 

513.47 515.14 A: me i'm thirty three 

514.96 516.68 B: okay i i'm twenty eight 

516.58 517.77 A: you're twenty okay 

517.50 528.73 B: yeah so probably we were grew up around the same time when [laughter] when some of those fads were in and i i remember going to roller rinks too and uh there there's an example of an indoor activity going to a roller rink with the uh you know the four wheel skates 

522.00 522.83 A: (( yeah )) 

528.32 529.84 A: [laughter] there you go 

529.87 531.81 B: that was great back in the eighties 

530.28 531.31 A: yeah 

531.77 534.27 A: true big time the glory days [laughter] 

533.42 535.20 B: mhm [laughter] exactly 

535.13 536.12 A: yeah 

535.37 537.84 B: so so you play basketball what was the other thing you said you did 

537.71 542.36 A: i i jog some play volleyball you name it anything out there just to be out there in the sun 

541.80 549.81 B: uh-huh you know that's the one volleyball's the one sport i really my friends and i used to always get together in l._a. and play volleyball and i haven't i've not found a group up here to do that with 

549.94 557.48 B: i i got some friends that play softball and that kind of thing but i don't know softball's too slow for me i like i like the fast action like beach volleyball sand volleyball 

556.74 568.55 A: yeah yeah so- or softball i used to love playing i still do but it's kinda hard to get like you know eighteen people to play or things like that not with you know the basketball team you know just gotta get two on two or three on three or things like that so it 

563.33 564.55 B: yeah exactly [mn] 

566.76 576.24 B: right it's kind of ironic 'cause actually i have an easy opportunity to play softball 'cause my company has a league but i'm i'm just not into it i'd i'd actually rather play like two on two basketball or something like that 

571.82 572.68 A: okay 

575.66 576.85 A: yeah 

576.63 581.86 B: actually have a uh there's a court just down the street from my house but i haven't gotten down there very much [laughter] 

581.37 582.37 A: okay 

582.84 590.11 B: i i went out about a few months ago to try to remember how to shoot hoops and uh try to actually make a basket [laughter] it was it was pretty embarrassing 

589.60 593.63 A: yeah [laughter] yeah so what sort of what sort of outdoor sports uh 

593.95 595.39 A: we we haven't mentioned 

596.57 599.81 A: sports we're all trying to learn or things like that you mentioned 

598.09 599.89 B: [laughter] yeah well
