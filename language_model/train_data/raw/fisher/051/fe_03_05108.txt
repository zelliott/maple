3.81 5.05 A: hello 

4.38 5.63 B: hello 

5.55 6.93 A: hi i'm nick 

6.78 10.51 B: okay eric my name is jack what is the topic for the day 

10.45 12.44 A: uh peace in the middle east 

11.85 15.26 B: oh peace in the middle east well i sure hope it comes soon 

15.15 18.36 A: [laughter] yeah 

18.56 23.92 A: i don't know i [mn] it's been not so peaceful for a very long time 

23.26 34.58 B: that's for sure well i was uh watching a news programme last night and uh one of the reports said well every few years there's uh a new hope for peace and it never really has come 

34.38 38.42 B: that way but well what other is there except hope 

38.61 41.50 B: so gotta look forward to that 

38.75 39.90 A: yeah 

41.24 45.27 A: yeah i think that's a good thing and you know hope 

43.50 44.67 B: and while i 

44.86 58.83 B: don't really go along with um president bush on a lot of things but one of the uh people i was hearing said that part of the reason they invaded iraq in the first place was to cut off their the iraqi support for terrorism which 

58.65 71.81 B: uh you know and there's debate about how how much iraq may have supported terrorists but it may even uh scare off other governments that would have supported terrorism so well hopefully that's that's working [laughter] 

70.80 80.95 A: yeah well honestly i am kind of concerned um i don't know i have been watching bill moir's now i don't know if you see that it's on public television and it's like 

73.91 75.59 B: mhm 

76.36 77.73 B: mhm 

81.01 90.24 A: i got the sense that what bush has done i mean certainly saddam should have been taken out and but i 

90.34 98.07 A: i'm you know i'm really concerned that all these weapons that were supposed to be there now they're loose [laughter] 

95.11 96.58 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

96.99 99.80 B: we certainly haven't found anything yet although 

98.98 113.68 A: well i think i think what what happened is probably someone took 'em you know they took the the art you know the our treasures of of persia from thousands and thousands of years you know the thieves 

103.45 105.32 B: mhm 

106.52 108.23 B: yeah 

113.80 115.45 B: yeah 

114.27 116.66 A: and they probably took the weapons too 

116.55 117.62 B: yeah 

116.98 117.75 A: so 

117.70 118.92 B: now one of my 

117.90 122.67 A: and now now there's just crime all over the streets and gang rape is common 

120.96 121.90 B: yes 

122.37 124.26 B: mhm 

122.77 127.08 A: and and it's it's not good [mn] you know it's like 

126.38 130.53 B: right well hopefully they're continuing to build a police force and that our 

130.34 145.01 B: military and military police who's ever there is learning more about uh where problems might come up and how to deal with them and all of that but i think one of the other things that we in the united states need to do is to learn 

137.85 138.81 A: yeah 

144.94 152.51 B: have more people learn how to speak arabic because apparently that's a real weakness in the uh c._i._a. and f._b._i. 

148.11 149.36 A: [laughter] 

152.39 157.00 A: you bet [mn] you bet just for intelligence yeah 

154.61 155.69 B: (( so if )) 

156.62 165.58 B: we're going to communicate at all then we certainly need to to learn more about that i've wondered myself about trying to build a career that way although 

161.70 162.90 A: yeah 

165.44 172.70 B: uh it's been a long time since i've studied any language i'm not sure 'cause my hearing is kind of impaired now how i'd do that 

171.63 175.68 A: okay yeah yeah um can you hear me just fine 

175.05 176.59 B: yes i can hear you 

176.21 177.47 A: okay okay 

177.89 183.33 B: some times are difficult but lower higher tones are always the worst ones for me 

182.09 188.13 A: oh okay okay well i'll try to make sure i speak up [laughter] all right um 

185.40 186.65 B: that's okay 

188.24 192.64 A: yeah i don't know i'm i'm just concerned about that whole situation it's it's 

191.18 192.97 B: mhm 

192.84 206.62 A: i i don't i don't know if it will get better i mean i i think it's possible but i i just think that i mean i look at the israelis they're not doing such a good job and i the british didn't do a good job when they 

197.94 199.24 B: mhm 

206.50 213.17 A: divvied up the middle east we're not doing a good job [laughter] [mn] 

206.86 210.26 B: [mn] all right well there was that although just 

210.85 213.12 B: yeah well recently though of course 

213.27 215.42 B: sharon said that uh 

215.23 221.31 B: um oh gave some indications that he was work- interested in working on peace and and uh there may 

221.18 230.73 B: possibly some hope for developing something between the palestinians and getting a palestinian state and and uh apparently a large number 

227.40 228.69 A: yeah 

230.61 244.45 B: of the isra- israeli population is willing to give up the west bank and and i don't have a position towards that's the right thing to do or not but if they think it is and that can be done well then hopefully that would move the whole thing toward peace 

244.27 248.40 A: yeah yeah you know i see no no reason 

248.72 258.30 A: other than unwillingness to get along on both sides i see no reason that it couldn't just be one state you know why you know why this 

255.52 257.19 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

258.81 262.22 A: i don't know just call it whatever [laughter] i mean 

260.76 262.35 B: yeah 

262.75 266.74 A: uh i guess it's d- difficult to have pluralism though 

266.55 268.26 B: mhm 

266.78 275.65 A: especially you know but i i think one of the main problems is anyone who is moderate on the issues is you know executed or or 

275.72 277.36 A: or um 

277.37 280.15 A: or you know murdered or or something 

279.64 281.42 B: mhm 

280.24 287.37 A: you know and and you don't want to speak out against the israeli government and and the israelis 

287.74 293.26 A: you know don't want to speak out against their government and the palestinians don't want to speak out against their government and 

292.64 294.24 B: yeah 

293.37 297.03 A: it's you know it's it's difficult situation 

296.71 305.87 B: yeah of course but some some people are so radicalized that they're willing to send their young people into suicide bombing situations that's a hard thing to stop and 

300.32 301.33 A: yeah 

305.47 308.59 A: well yeah and there's an endless supply of them 

307.88 309.64 B: apparently yeah 

308.65 316.31 A: and and really the way to stop that is not by increasing security i mean clearly security is important but 

315.64 316.91 B: yeah 

316.71 318.40 A: uh [mn] 

317.18 318.04 B: (( gotta )) 

318.20 325.08 B: improve the education and career opportunities for people so that they feel like they've got something to lose if 

322.27 323.50 A: yeah 

324.71 330.83 A: exactly exactly so that they're not thinking okay well this life is horrible but 

330.57 331.51 B: mhm 

330.61 341.99 A: i can do my family some good by getting them some money and you know for everyone that dies there's ten more to take his or her place and yeah 

332.66 333.83 B: that's right 

334.48 335.76 B: yeah 

339.36 341.11 B: mhm 

342.53 347.46 A: and i [mn] i don't know it's very frustrating [laughter] 

345.96 347.87 B: yes it certainly is 

347.95 356.96 B: and then what we could do about energy is a different side of the problem if i don't know if we imported less oil would that help or hurt because if the 

352.09 353.70 A: absolutely 

356.87 367.06 B: oil price of oil plunged would that further disrupt things there or would it bring about more peace uh and and maybe not so many countries would be 

367.16 370.70 B: uh trying to disrupt things over there i don't know i 

370.19 373.08 A: yeah well i gotta say my car 

372.68 374.05 B: mhm 

373.11 380.21 A: is old [laughter] and it's an old honda civic and i get forty miles a gallon 

377.39 378.48 B: mhm 

379.94 382.71 B: good well that that certainly helps and 

381.47 396.27 A: that's you gotta do something you know and i try to not drive it unless i need to and sometimes i walk sometimes i bus or bike you know you gotta look at it and every time you buy a new car or a new anything um 

383.66 384.54 B: yeah 

386.55 387.43 B: mhm 

389.09 390.03 B: yeah 

396.38 399.82 A: inevitably oil is involved in the production of it 

399.13 413.59 B: absolutely yeah and yet in some many communities including where i live uh it's just hard to get around on the bus i've got an eighteen mile commute from where i live to my primary job and the other one i work with a uh uh 

400.82 401.77 A: yeah 

408.60 409.69 A: oh sure 

409.71 410.77 A: sure 

413.75 422.18 B: psychology department at vanderbilt and and uh we go to people's homes to help troubled kids so that's a good thing but it involves going 

420.82 423.45 A: yeah you need to be mobile for that yeah 

422.78 436.85 B: yeah so i drove forty miles today just doing that and they reimburse me for mileage so financially it's not a big problem but it still burns all that petroleum but plus burning up the tires on the car itself so 

429.60 431.96 A: right right 

436.17 445.59 A: i you know i think it's some i think it's you know it's good to to um if if what you're doing as a living is is good if if the net effect is good 

445.56 452.25 A: then it's just fine to burn petroleum but you know i look at people who idle the cars in the winter 

445.65 447.33 B: yeah 

451.86 453.57 B: mhm 

452.35 457.70 A: you know and minnesota's where i'm from and you know [mn] 

455.83 456.69 B: mhm 

456.95 459.01 B: gotta have some heat up there 

458.37 461.47 A: yeah oh geeze you know it's 

461.74 467.36 A: it's not it's not all a pretty situation there's so much waste and diesel 

463.95 465.70 B: mhm 

467.47 482.17 A: um and i i think a lot of that is um a lot of the air pollution and diesel consumption is just the the auto makers don't want better fuel efficiency and they have enough lobbyists to pull it off year after year 

474.47 475.67 B: right 

479.78 480.83 B: yeah 

482.02 496.83 B: the may be moving slowly and and whether there could be more emphasis you know if if i mean all of us are citizens many of us are stockholders in one way or the other and if we can get input onto the the companies that way then they might move a little more quickly 

491.14 492.26 A: right 

496.35 500.81 A: well the interesting thing about that is i was just watching um 

496.92 497.92 B: and 

501.82 509.50 A: god what was it louis rukaiser i think you know he's pretty conservative yeah with john john bogel 

504.13 506.24 B: mhm last night's show 

506.87 508.74 B: oh i saw that one too 

509.03 510.20 B: mhm 

509.68 518.48 A: bogel said well you know the little guy wants to have his voice or her voice but but um 

515.13 516.44 B: mhm 

519.08 527.29 A: these institutional investors you know one hundred institutional investors probably like harvard university and just you know large 

525.51 526.51 B: mhm 

527.49 537.62 A: companies and institutions own so many shares of stock they don't want the little guy to have a voice they vote you know so all these um 

530.85 531.94 B: mhm 

537.72 548.88 A: um you know merrill lynch and all these brokerage firms they don't want um it to be known how they're casting their proxy votes 

541.54 542.40 B: mhm 

548.35 552.43 B: well perhaps it would be embarrassing at some times yeah 

548.93 557.07 A: you know these companies are just gonna keep doing things the same way and there's not a lot we can do to leverage them you know 

553.19 554.16 B: yeah 

556.51 568.98 B: yeah well of course uh i'm on college alumnae i could at least write to the college president and tell him you now well try to vote nicely and i think some of the people would it's it's hard to know but uh 

558.08 559.59 A: and i think we 

562.60 563.66 A: right 

567.15 568.11 A: yeah 

569.49 572.64 A: i don't know i'm i'm pretty cynical about that [laughter] 

571.87 572.88 B: uh-huh 

572.80 574.14 A: i really am 

574.35 575.39 A: um 

575.43 577.06 B: (( well well one of the things that )) 

575.47 580.64 A: i think sometimes the best thing is to just change the law [laughter] 

579.24 588.77 B: if you if you watch louis rukaiser once one of the things that may temper that a little bit is usually if you can get three to four percent of the shareholders to take a position 

582.35 583.29 A: sure 

588.47 589.51 A: right 

588.60 599.95 B: on something then then the company usually changes because they don't want flak at their their stock holders meeting whatever the issue unless it's terribly uneconomic or something that they probably would go along with 

594.27 597.08 A: [laughter] right
