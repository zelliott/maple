102.01 103.62 B: i don't know about uh 

103.75 116.72 B: [lipsmack] uh about wisconsin and uh minnesota and all out there i but i know california and texas and other states are really really bad washington isn't too bad off i think their def- deficit was only six hundred fifty million dollars so that's not too bad

122.62 124.05 A: they've really uh 

124.50 127.57 A: [mn] cut back a lot of teaching positions and when 

127.73 135.81 A: when um fulltime faculty retire they don't replace them and i'm trying to move into something a little more fulltime and it's certainly hard 

135.22 148.96 B: man i i imagine i could have that same conversation i could have said pretty much the same thing my uh my wife teaches fulltime she's a high school math teacher um her position is secure but i haven't worked fulltime since sep- september of two thousand and one

171.40 173.13 A: (( mm )) 

174.49 188.65 A: mm are ya yeah i i i wish i had my masters 'cause it would open up a lot a lot more teaching doors for me i i retired from from my company after twenty eight years last summer with the intention of teaching more and it 

174.50 177.31 B: so i'm thinking about going back to school myself

200.57 202.43 B: oh right right okay 

201.97 205.48 A: you know we're uh we basically have those skills so we so we

214.10 226.76 B: i've i've never never really taken to it i've been around others who golf and i just i just don't see the appeal you know you you hit this ball and walk for a long time and after it and you hit it again walk a long time after it it just doesn't really seem like a lot of fun 

216.77 217.97 A: mhm 

219.36 220.28 A: yeah 

220.50 223.04 A: yeah yeah 

224.20 231.20 A: [laughter] well somebody wrote a book i think it was john feinstein wrote the book uh a good walk spoiled 

230.47 232.03 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

231.09 246.05 A: that yeah that's about golf so i think that's probably it but i [mn] i like it a lot mainly because i can golf with friends and and we just have good times you know it's just good to get away [sigh] you know they say that the worst day on a golf course is better than the best day at work so 

245.38 247.83 B: [laughter] 

246.29 251.91 A: and i i agree with that um things are kinda tough in our in our office and so when 

252.03 263.81 A: when things really get ugly there's usually the little note passing goes around let's meet at twelve o'clock for golf so [laughter] it's like a toga party you know we just like the worst time to do it but let's do it anyway [sigh] 

258.02 258.93 B: right 

263.32 271.15 B: right i i never really had that experience i've worked at uh like game companies and i was at m._s._n._b._c. for a while in the the um 

269.04 270.57 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

271.21 283.36 B: yeah the culture there was you know let's all go and you know watch this latest you know b. movie science fiction movie that comes out or let's all go out and you know to the arcade and play some games for a while it's it's more that kind of thing they don't really seem to do anything physical 

276.66 277.60 A: yeah 

282.80 292.68 A: yeah well i like that too i like eccentric places that um you know i well i like golf um i'm not very good at it uh my knees are not very good so i 

291.33 293.05 B: (( mm )) 

292.67 301.62 A: i have to take a cart so i don't get a lot of exercise from it but uh 'cause the way i i usually don't hit it anywhere near where the cart can go so i you know i do get 

300.50 302.92 B: [laughter] 

301.71 311.15 A: [laughter] but i i quit playing golf twice because i got so frustrated with it now i don't care if i hit a bad shot i just don't care it just so i just [noise] put it 

308.35 309.18 B: huh 

310.10 312.13 B: the balls aren't that expensive i guess 

311.19 324.46 A: no they're not that expensive and i used to get a lot of logo balls and i figured it was a it was an advertisement you know for my company if i hit it into the woods and somebody'll find it and maybe ship with us so [sigh] but uh anyway it's um i don't [mn] 

318.56 320.86 B: [laughter] 

325.28 338.39 A: other than maybe cutting the grass or being outside to do stuff i'm not uh the neighbors walk but i i think if if i walked in the morning i'd probably not be very mobile afternoon just because i've had six surgeries on my right knee so 

337.71 341.93 B: yikes did you like play football or something when you were younger or hm 

339.87 346.23 A: no i uh i had a bone tumor when i was ten [sigh] and i had a a big infection of my uh 

342.74 343.67 B: hm 

346.33 355.82 A: uh [mn] part of my bone removed below below the knee and it's and then i hurt playing baseball in junior high and i had i had f- 

349.82 352.32 B: (( hm )) 

355.90 359.17 A: four surgeries by the time i was about 

359.20 359.76 A: (( [mn] )) 

361.63 374.74 A: before i was a senior in high school so it's just been you know i've had a couple since so [sigh] i probably needed a knee replacement [cough] that's probably what i'll have to do but uh other than that i so i'm not that physical 

369.59 371.26 B: (( yeah hm )) 

374.43 376.32 B: well that's that's that's a shame 

375.80 389.11 A: yeah yeah and i and i and i should be i mean i there's a neighbor whose dad is e- eighty two and he plays um softball and he's been bugging me to join his team he said we need you young fast guys 

382.83 385.47 B: hm 

388.75 393.33 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

389.63 391.31 A: and i said yeah that's me 

391.86 401.96 A: [laughter] but he's a he was running to base a couple of years ago and he thought somebody hit him in the chest with a ball and he got up started running and it turns out he'd had a heart attack 

401.50 402.61 B: jeeze 

402.60 413.79 A: [laughter] so he's you know he he went to third and then he scored and then after the game he didn't feel well he went home took a shower told his wife he wasn't feeling well and went to the hospital and he'd had a heart attack during the game so 

413.29 414.82 B: man [laughter] 

414.26 416.05 A: (( so yeah )) 

415.27 418.09 B: must not have been too bad a heart attack if he could do all that 

416.70 425.57 A: no well he had i think he had a an angioplasty and he went you know he was a couple of weeks later he was playing again so he loves it he's on like three different leagues 

422.89 423.81 B: [laughter] 

425.51 426.67 B: jeeze 

426.74 429.56 A: so i'd love i'd love to be able to do that 

429.25 434.38 B: oh yeah well hopefully they can you know give you a decent knee that will allow you to do that 

432.78 438.16 A: yeah yeah [sigh] but you guys get a lot of rain out there right 

437.45 439.66 B: um that's a it's it's 

439.54 445.63 B: it's kind of a a misnomer i don't think that really it's overcast more than it rains we actually 

444.31 445.37 A: oh okay 

445.52 460.36 B: i moved here from texas i'd lived there a long time and actually it rains more in fort worth than it does here it's just that here it's overcast and it just falls more gently over a longer period so that you know all the vegetation can actually use it [sigh] and um in the summertime it's actually drier than phoenix 

448.25 449.92 A: (( mm )) 

455.15 457.48 A: uh-huh yeah 

460.23 461.09 A: oh 

460.90 471.90 B: although that seems to have started a little early this year it's been bright sun uh like for the past week and that's usually june is generally a pretty wet dreary month it kinda starts to drive people crazy and the sun only comes out around fourth of july 

463.76 464.80 A: yeah 

468.28 469.38 A: (( mhm )) 

471.34 472.39 A: mhm 

472.40 475.31 B: but that seems to have started about a month early this time 

475.77 484.82 A: yeah it's it's been really wet this month so for the last maybe two months it's really we've not really even had a summer a real summer day yet 

485.15 499.41 A: [sigh] um we're not i don't know it's i'm [sigh] if you're out selling i don't really want it to be raining you know [mn] and then when it's really nice uh you don't wanna really work but [sigh] um i'd just soon have it you know 

491.56 493.11 B: [laughter] 

499.37 509.97 A: it would be nice and bright and sunny i guess we lived in southern california for seven years and the weather was the same every day and you almost kinda hoped for rain once in a while just to break break things up
