28.82 29.90 A: okay 

29.32 30.88 B: [laughter]

33.12 35.29 B: do they improve 

35.97 38.75 B: wait it ah i should have written do they improve 

38.99 44.88 B: and something else about education do they improve or you you didn't listen you didn't pay attention either [laughter] 

43.97 47.48 A: so we're basically just supposed to talk to each other for ten minutes 

46.93 48.78 B: on the subject of education 

48.45 49.57 A: wow 

49.99 53.81 A: [noise] okay so first of all do you have children 

53.58 56.57 B: ah i have a kid in high school how about you 

56.47 66.04 A: [lipsmack] i also a daughter in high school a senior actually and in the fall she will be going to college the university of rhode island 

63.41 64.38 B: uh-huh 

66.07 71.01 B: so do they have computers in all the classrooms in your daughter's school 

70.87 75.31 A: she is buying a laptop through the school 

75.41 85.84 A: um it's going to come with the software already downloaded that they use and she will bring it from her dorm room to the classroom as she needs it 

78.96 80.41 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

86.28 97.30 B: right so that's for college but how about for right now does she ah does is does she does her school provide computers in the classroom for the kids to do their studying on [sigh] 

96.96 98.81 A: not not at all 

98.45 99.39 B: oh in 

99.06 100.33 A: do they by you 

100.13 101.48 B: (( ah )) 

101.59 107.87 B: not in every classroom but there are de- there are definitely computers in the library and in the science rooms 

107.24 111.41 A: oh yes ye- definitely in the library and definitely if you 

111.42 120.92 A: took specifically a course that's ah computer related here there were are some courses that you will have a computer but for the most part ah no 

120.91 126.67 B: uh-huh is the expectation that the kids will do their work on the computer 

127.48 128.86 A: in college 

128.28 130.76 B: in in in high school yeah 

129.00 136.65 A: in high school um no no i don't think she does and i don't think she does the homework on on the computer 

136.69 142.65 A: ah no i don't think she's using the computer at this point much except for ah 

142.70 149.01 A: you know iming her friends at from home [laughter] that's what she's using the computer for at this point 

145.40 146.47 B: uh-huh 

148.26 150.52 B: right right um 

150.58 154.40 B: well that's interesting much my my kid is just the opposite 

154.52 158.42 B: she uses a computer a lot she uses it um 

158.44 165.65 B: well for she she does all her writing on the computer does your daughter type her or use a typewriter or hand write or 

164.53 172.99 A: um she yeah if she has a a report to do she will use the computer for that ah for the most part though no 

169.26 170.30 B: mhm 

173.14 174.05 B: uh-huh 

173.38 176.13 A: she's not using it a lot for homework 

175.65 176.77 B: okay 

176.80 177.92 B: so 

178.04 180.67 B: um [lipsmack] so that's 

180.84 184.83 B: that's a difference i i get the sense in in new york city that 

184.90 186.62 B: you know there's um 

187.26 201.62 B: there's a real concern that kids be comfortable and proficient at using the computer not just in terms of typing but in terms of um accessing research on the internet you know [noise] 

201.57 206.38 B: parents want their kids to you know be part of the cyber age 

206.92 208.21 A: um 

207.23 212.50 B: and and they feel that that it's important for the schools to take a role in um 

212.71 215.62 B: in in in achieving that 

215.00 218.86 A: i would think that would make sense i mean i would think that would be 

216.68 217.81 B: mhm 

219.05 221.75 A: ah something they would want kids to do 

222.11 229.03 A: you know because that's obviously for the for their generation it's going just be a huge part of their future 

228.73 235.05 B: but you do you you don't do you feel that's happening in the school where your your kid is now it sounds like it's it's not 

234.46 243.52 A: it's no i don't think it is i don't think it is i don't think she knows how to ah you know she has she's taking computer 

236.20 237.10 B: uh-huh 

243.58 249.78 A: classes so she knows how to navigate her a way her way around a computer 

249.39 250.41 B: mhm 

249.79 252.63 A: but i don't think she you know she doesn't know i 

252.79 264.92 A: unless she took a course she wouldn't know they weren't teaching every all the kids about ah you know ah [lipsmack] creating web pages and things like that so they weren't really teaching them 

264.63 265.66 B: right 

265.08 269.72 A: things that would be more useful for internet related careers 

269.30 273.67 B: right so so there's two things there there's um 

274.62 283.11 B: the computer as an end to itself like you said creating web pages or thinking about a career in computers and then there's using 

283.23 290.42 B: computers as a tool to further your work in other areas i think it's really two separate things 

290.04 291.84 A: (( yes i agree )) 

292.11 295.61 A: well i don't know how you know 

295.75 303.79 A: how much of a role ah should a high school play in that i you know i guess like i said i guess in these in these times 

303.92 310.48 A: they they should play a bigger role in that because that's [noise] ah definitely going to be a part of their future 

310.59 315.50 A: internet is only becoming more and more a part of the workplace 

314.86 316.18 B: (( right [noise] )) 

316.19 322.30 B: so if if if our question is [laughter] do you think that the ah computer is um 

322.89 331.48 B: are improvement in terms of um education what would you do you do you feel like you have an opinion about that 

331.12 343.23 A: i i would say that it it the computer would be an improvement in terms of education but i would say that in the case of my daughter i don't think it's playing that big of a part 

342.87 343.85 B: uh-huh 

343.79 353.26 A: i i mean i think it's helped her to she's a er ty- types very fast [laughter] that's probably more from the instant messages [noise] anything else also 

348.34 350.02 B: [laughter] 

351.12 352.83 B: yeah yeah yeah 

352.86 353.82 B: right 

353.25 364.51 A: she i never seen anybody type so fast so she's she's she's got obviously learned some skills from the computer [laughter] but i don't i don't know that she's you know i don't think that she's 

355.46 356.44 B: right 

358.51 360.37 B: [laughter] 

364.84 367.09 A: you know know she hasn't been taught 

367.25 378.13 A: you know microsoft programs or you know word or excel for example things that you probably could use some day in your workplace i mean i i use those in my workplace 

369.76 370.81 B: mhm 

372.25 373.37 B: mhm 

375.50 376.76 B: right 

377.49 378.78 B: mhm 

378.17 385.82 A: it it but ah i had to go and take a course and learn them and it they didn't really teach her those things in high school where she goes 

384.43 388.17 B: right well i think some people are um 

388.42 393.30 B: feel that if the computer is in the classroom then kids will not learn 

393.76 394.58 B: ah 

394.66 400.93 B: the traditional ah by the the traditional methods of doing research and and 

400.94 407.95 B: and thinking there's this concern that oh the computer physic- the computer you know sort of makes things easier 

408.22 409.39 B: um 

409.56 413.19 B: that kids are not are and are not gonna 

414.03 417.36 B: get the sense of the whole process of research 

417.60 428.64 B: in other words rather than going to the library and spending hours and looking things up you know they're they're typing and pressing buttons and having you know everything appear instantly 

428.91 443.31 A: yeah well i think that i i don't think people will be doing that any more at the libraries right i think that's gonna become ah dinosaur [laughter] you won't have to do that it's everything is so easily at your ah finger tips 

434.04 435.39 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

437.36 438.73 B: exactly 

443.83 447.34 A: (( that ah i dunno the library is ah )) 

447.68 452.41 A: obviously still good for books but ah for research i 

452.60 456.59 A: think it's probably certain things that you can only find there but for the most part you 

456.87 460.04 A: can find out almost anything on the computer 

459.60 471.23 B: yeah i well i think i think it's it's not just an improvement i think it's pretty much necessary now i mean i think that's our world now i think [sigh] if if 

471.26 476.25 B: the computer's entirely missing from the school or from from the classroom 

476.26 482.37 B: that those kids are really going to be at a disadvantage and of course you know there are many areas where 

482.73 484.74 B: schools just don't have the money 

484.95 487.36 B: to to offer that 

488.01 500.33 A: yeah um i don't know if that's the case with her school um she lives actually ah i'm divorced so she lives with my ex wife in new jersey in a small town midland park in new jersey 

495.49 496.39 B: uh-huh 

499.87 500.71 B: uh-huh 

500.30 507.67 A: and maybe that's being a small town doesn't have the ah resources to put a ah computer at every desk 

507.87 512.03 A: so ah that might be a part of it in the suburbs i dunno 

511.79 520.23 B: mm well it's certainly ah the case in the urban areas you know where that the funding for schools is [noise] 

520.37 524.21 B: you know really critically um 

524.67 526.51 B: [lipsmack] below what it should be 

526.73 535.04 B: and ah i think only where schools have gotten grants you know like through bill gates foundation and other organizations have 

535.20 543.82 B: have they been able to you know provide them it's my my impression was that you know these big suburban schools were all so well equipped and so 

543.79 550.67 B: you know state of the art this and that ah it's it's interesting to hear that you know i'm i'm wrong about that 

550.90 555.88 A: yeah yeah well in like i say it's a small town so i don't know that it's ah 

553.79 554.71 B: mhm 

555.99 562.27 A: i don't know that's ah a good a good ah town to use as a comparison yeah 

560.58 561.65 B: i see 

562.50 563.83 A: (( i dunno )) 

564.29 566.54 A: well what else 

566.21 569.52 B: ah let's see have we exhausted is our ten minutes up 

567.67 568.91 A: [laughter] 

569.05 573.44 A: so i think so e- oh yeah not just not yet they're supposed to notify us 

572.98 574.02 B: okay 

573.53 579.71 A: so i guess we're kinda in agreement that we think that computers are helping 

579.99 591.37 B: are a benefit well the thing about small towns like you're describing that you know the the computer can literally put the world at at those kids' fingertips you know they can 

580.97 581.94 A: right 

591.24 597.12 B: access not only printed matter you can access sound you can access video 

597.23 599.89 B: um you can make up for
