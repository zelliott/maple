35.15 41.67 B: one is they have the same capabilities as we do 

42.98 45.28 B: in uh weaponry 

45.42 48.35 B: uh two would be 

48.59 51.22 B: they have actually more 

51.59 53.13 B: discipline 

53.70 59.47 B: and outnumber us quite a bit armed forces wise 

59.73 63.52 B: and three they'd be more willing to push the button that we would 

63.46 65.99 A: oh why do you think they'd be more willing to push the button 

68.91 69.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

70.19 71.13 B: hm 

75.51 77.52 B: because of their pride 

77.36 83.41 A: because of their pride because do you think that they they feel that we challenge them to a degree in 

83.77 91.26 A: i don't know probably several areas that their pride would instill them to come forward if the relations fell apart and possibly 

90.62 91.79 B: no 

92.38 99.16 B: i think it has more to do with their culture their history 

99.29 101.03 B: (( their )) 

102.63 105.00 B: morality and character 

105.28 108.94 B: of how how they've built themselves 

105.44 106.27 A: okay

119.81 121.70 A: yeah [laughter] 

122.17 123.40 A: i agree i 

123.57 131.92 A: i kind of envy some of the other nations in in the world as they've gone forward and taken care of their society a lot more closely than we've bothered to take care of ours 

132.00 140.96 A: and they've not worried so much about their foreign relations and the impact of their efforts and what they're doing internally to against those foreign nations as we have 

141.01 150.08 A: we seemed to be worried so much about how everybody else reacts and does things compared to what we have going on internally that we missed the boat i think sometimes with 

150.25 152.23 A: making ourselves a stronger nation 

154.40 156.29 B: and what exactly do you do 

156.45 159.19 A: um i'm a manager for an airline

205.56 215.38 A: at a hub operation compared to where i was working in the corporate office with international stuff and i don't really see a huge threat from many nations right now um 

215.50 227.39 A: as far as there's there's the threat of somebody pushing a button i agree with you there [cough] i just don't think many people have the guts to actually do that because of the retaliation that would occur 

228.12 230.59 A: and knowing that we have the power to 

230.63 232.11 A: (( um go and )) 

231.10 232.35 B: (( [noise] retaliate )) 

232.46 239.27 A: yeah well go into just about any country with faster than anybody else in the world can we have the the might of our 

239.17 253.45 A: armed forces that can get anywhere in the world in a hurry and a lot of the other nations don't they have may have a rocket that can get a a bomb or a nuclear weapon to a certain location but they don't have the forces behind that to back up any anything but one or two 

252.85 256.10 B: [noise] and you don't think china does [noise] [noise] 

255.39 258.71 A: no i don't i don't think china has the power within 

259.06 271.33 A: their realm within their forces to do anything i go back to the past wars and and different things that they've been involved with conflict wise and they've never shown huge strength other than as a land force 

271.30 285.78 A: to be able to do things and being stuck in in europe the land force wouldn't have a great opportunity to get here and our greater ability in the air and in the water would probably you know keep them away from our coastal areas 

274.72 275.80 B: [noise] 

276.89 278.24 B: [noise] 

285.96 287.36 B: you think so huh 

287.32 300.90 A: i i strongly believe that we have the ability to dominate any country in the air and in the water um on the ground because of the sheer size and mass of some some nations i think they may have some opportunity there but i i 

288.22 289.41 B: [noise] 

301.00 307.62 A: don't don't see it anywhere else in the air and in the water i think we are very supreme compared to other companies other countries right now 

307.16 309.83 B: yeah i agree we are in the air 

310.56 312.19 B: but uh 

312.58 314.94 B: china's definitely uh 

315.05 318.48 B: (( their nuclear um with this new )) 

318.52 324.80 B: with the president that they have right now [noise] or new leader i should say uh 

325.17 330.72 B: he's a lot more aggressive in the technology area [noise] than uh 

330.97 332.69 B: the past have been 

333.66 335.99 B: but the one thing that 

333.76 334.75 A: (( yeah that )) 

335.53 336.98 A: go ahead 

336.73 340.73 B: i guess the biggest problem would be i i i just feel it 

340.86 343.64 B: comes down to the family unit 

343.88 346.98 B: and uh in other countries um 

347.71 352.23 B: the family unit is still very strongly and ritually deep 

354.39 355.84 B: (( there is a )) 

356.75 358.11 B: respect 

358.36 359.66 B: and honor 

360.29 365.51 B: a character that uh is bred within them 

366.23 370.63 B: um generation to generation which we are losing 

371.13 375.80 B: from generation to generation it seems like lately 

377.03 378.41 B: and uh 

379.06 382.12 B: i think that has a lot to do with our undoing 

382.64 391.09 B: of this nat- nation if uh we don't bring it back around [noise] because we do bring each generation it changes 

391.07 398.13 B: if you look at from the sixties seventies [noise] and the seventies to the eighties the different generations [noise] 

398.31 402.69 B: has changed dramatically [noise] especially from the sixties and seventies 

403.22 406.93 B: where you went from a family unit to 

407.36 409.94 B: people telling others what to do 

409.98 412.31 B: [noise] to the feminist movement 

412.52 413.84 B: to 

415.36 420.19 B: individuality to [noise] now 

420.48 423.84 B: you don't even get to you don't want to know your neighbor 

423.60 424.62 A: uh-huh 

424.91 426.94 B: and and that's really sad 

426.75 437.07 A: i agree completely we've we've lost a lot of the family values and the stuff that we used to have i i don't know how you old you are but back when i was growing up my parents could let us go 

437.26 442.73 A: out and play and to worry about where we were and what was going on with us and there wasn't 

438.46 439.24 B: [noise] 

440.08 441.05 B: [noise] 

441.90 444.32 B: i'm forty [noise] 

442.96 447.33 A: yeah i've i've just turned thirty seven and so they they 

447.37 453.03 A: there was that opportunity for kids to grow up and be kids and and learn amongst each other rather than 

451.15 451.92 B: yes 

452.84 462.68 A: have to you know have to be taken to a park or have to be taken to a play area or have to be taken somewhere because of the fear that something may happen with your child when he's out and you can't see him 

462.56 465.49 B: and it isn't actually just the female anymore either 

465.29 466.19 A: uh-huh 

466.94 469.40 B: i mean now it's uh 

469.83 472.38 B: the older they until 

472.47 481.37 B: through twenty one it's uh and people are becoming more victims than they have their their character isn't strong anymore their 

481.39 483.02 B: values are 

483.32 486.67 B: just self image that's who they are 

487.00 489.18 B: has uh fallen apart 

489.55 491.42 B: i think um 

491.44 493.79 B: there aren't as many strong 

496.18 497.81 B: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

498.72 500.91 B: oh i can't even think of the word 

501.27 505.05 B: but just feeling good about themselves and who they are 

505.68 506.74 A: yeah 

505.75 512.43 B: people have become very insecure and have used the insecurity to uh direct them in 

512.96 516.48 B: other directions instead of going back to 

516.83 518.96 B: their parents or their the 

519.58 522.52 B: disrespect it's just generation to generation 

522.75 526.61 B: the respect of people is just getting worse and worse 

526.47 527.38 A: (( and [mn] )) 

527.48 542.41 A: leading back on those topics do you think that that makes us less strong as a nation that could rally around situations that might occur if a war to evolve involve us when it was there actually were threats 

541.70 544.77 B: [noise] well look what happened recently 

545.73 549.80 B: sure we have the right to our voice our opinion 

550.16 554.49 B: but i think there's a time and a place for voicing our opinions 

554.27 555.68 A: (( yeah )) 

555.46 558.32 B: and when you're in the middle of a war 

559.09 561.20 B: for the freedom

571.46 573.76 B: you know the family unit 

573.92 578.24 B: and abused and we're there trying to help them 

578.27 583.49 B: you shouldn't have part of the part of the united states 

583.52 586.26 B: over here slamming 

587.21 591.43 B: the people that are dying for our freedom as well the 

591.70 596.50 B: freedom of other human beings i mean
