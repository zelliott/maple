32.18 33.54 B: yeah 

33.33 34.35 A: well 

34.56 41.76 A: who who i think is a threat uh you know i i really don't know what to what to believe anymore whether it's you know to 

41.87 47.73 A: whether the whether some country's you know after us or whether there's just you know a bunch of 

47.67 60.10 A: kooks that are out there wanting to wanting to stir up trouble or not i i really don't know [mn] you know you you want to believe the news media but then the news media starts you know sensationalizing everything 

59.42 60.49 B: (( uh-huh )) 

60.29 62.21 A: you just never know what to think 

62.37 66.41 B: yeah that's the same thing i said i'm i'm kind of confused here 

66.88 75.12 B: and i don't you know with the war you i think you're supposed to know but i'm really confused i don't know who's who anymore 

75.42 78.94 A: i i don't think we're ever gonna have a 

78.96 92.65 A: another war unless unless korea happens or something where it's gonna be decisively you know you are out you are going to battle you are going to fight uh this country until they surrender 

92.54 102.94 A: and then it's gonna be it's gonna be a you know that's gonna be the the end it's that's it's iraq's gonna keep on stirring up there's gonna be pockets of problems over there 

102.78 104.09 B: (( oh god )) 

103.43 110.92 A: and and it's it's so difficult to to know when to say when and who to trust and 

111.44 120.05 A: you know and then then you got you've got to have all your allies and then allies you know the people who you think are your friends like france or whatever 

120.10 130.34 A: then they they get all over ya because you want to go over and do something that i guess you believe is right i don't know i don't know we all try i think we try too hard to make other people happy 

125.78 126.89 B: (( mhm right )) 

130.31 135.36 B: i do too but you know what the biggest thing uh my discrepancy is um 

136.08 139.79 B: you know in other countries if you go over there 

140.05 146.18 B: you you've got plenty red tape and everything and you still almost can't it's impossible to get in 

147.25 152.29 B: [cough] but excuse me over here it's just the difference everybody comes 

150.95 151.94 A: oh i 

152.32 153.95 A: everybody comes 

153.53 157.62 B: so most of the people that we're fighting we have over here too 

157.60 158.78 A: uh-huh 

158.34 161.62 B: and you don't know if they're for the good or the evil 

161.77 172.22 B: so we we live in danger every day and i you know i'm i'm like you i don't think really there'll ever be world peace with us and uh 

173.31 177.21 B: over there the country we're fighting now i don't i don't think so 

177.09 187.97 A: no i don't i don't think we gonna ever make any of the of the arab population happy we're not going ever make one hundred percent of the world all love us up and down and jump up and down for joy 

187.67 189.23 B: exactly 

189.03 196.31 A: but i think i think what we do you know in all honesty is we really try to to put out the fires that are 

196.24 204.69 A: that are the the more important ones that like where there's there's people who are suffering or whatever we really tried to do that in somalia 

204.67 216.96 A: and we didn't do that properly over there we didn't you know we didn't take care of business we just kinda went in with very lightly and then we got when we had that big pocket of resistance we just pulled back 

204.71 205.78 B: uh-huh 

216.36 217.67 B: (( yeah )) 

217.04 225.74 A: well while in order to defeat somebody like that you're gotta kinda do like we did in iraq and just go in and use every bit of force we've got and then 

225.90 235.17 A: then kinda back off but you know we don't want to kill civilians we've never really wanted to but in world war two and world war one and in uh 

231.08 232.40 B: mhm 

235.09 243.94 A: in vietnam you never hear anything you didn't hear about you know civilians casualties or anything like that you just you know you took it for granted that that was part of war 

243.77 248.59 B: and i thought that's the way this war was gonna be you know but my 

246.54 247.40 A: yeah 

249.14 252.51 B: you know i i'm uh my heart goes out to uh 

252.80 257.24 B: the families that have lost their loved ones even in the september eleventh event 

256.88 257.94 A: yeah 

257.40 260.71 B: but the thing that really gets me 

260.80 264.68 B: it really breaks my heart is because of 

265.20 266.12 B: you know 

266.53 273.38 B: the the soldiers a lot of the soldiers that are going over there to fight they're babies youngsters and 

271.75 274.00 A: yeah yeah they're eighteen 

273.75 282.90 B: yeah and and they go over there and lost their life and they don't you know even know why really they just know they're patriotic and they're trying to save their country 

278.99 279.87 A: right 

282.95 284.22 B: and uh 

284.27 286.52 B: it's just really sad you know 

286.64 292.68 B: that they have to go up against people that are evil and have been taught to been been evil since birth 

292.29 293.33 A: uh-huh 

293.16 296.51 B: you know it's like fighting satan himself you know 

296.24 299.14 A: right well it it [mn] 

299.99 311.33 A: it's hard when you have that mentality those some of those kids are taught like you just said they're taught from the beginning that you know that every one of us needs to die you know and we try to teach 

311.43 316.51 A: you know our kids that that human life is is somewhat you know is is precious 

316.49 317.74 B: exactly 

316.97 327.67 A: that's the different mentality between you know the the societies i'm not saying that all people over there are bad at all i mean i know i know a lot of caldeans that are 

321.03 322.40 B: exactly 

327.64 336.86 A: here well i being in the i'm i'm just north of detroit and dearborn is is the top iraqi population in the united states 

335.92 336.89 B: (( mhm )) 

337.06 346.56 A: and uh there's a lot of 'em there's a lot of 'em around here that are decent hard working folk and they're not they're not bad at all it would be like oh in your in your area you're gotta a lot of hispanics 

342.05 342.98 B: yeah 

346.21 347.30 B: uh-huh 

346.83 349.43 A: so it's the same thing you you say 

348.51 350.40 B: good ones and bad ones 

349.74 355.99 A: you got it and there's a lot of good and just a few bads and those bads are the ones that [laughter] spoil it for everybody 

355.33 360.07 B: but you know the thing that really surprises me because i didn't know um 

360.42 371.54 B: you know that's like say the vietnam war well i thought to myself i said well i thought i said well my god those people have really got to be crazy strapping bombs to babies and 

371.25 372.28 A: uh-huh 

371.55 374.52 B: blowing up just to get their prey their target 

374.56 380.00 B: but this is the iraqis they've got 'em beat [laughter] they've really got 'em beat 

378.07 379.32 A: oh i know 

380.38 387.72 B: you know this we did those the vietnams they didn't start you know strapping bombs to their babies until we were at war 

380.52 381.50 A: well they 

387.69 395.86 B: and here the iraqis they've i mean before just before birth they've taught their kids to kill i say this has got it beat 

395.95 398.81 A: well how about those manufactured suits that they have 

399.01 403.41 A: did you see on the on the news where they showed that ca- that cache of those uh 

403.33 414.81 A: those uh bombing suits those suicide bombing suits that were manufactured for they were manufactured they they had fifty jackets that were manufactured for uh 

406.81 409.68 B: (( no i didn't see 'em what was that about )) 

411.36 412.24 B: uh-huh 

415.01 416.52 A: school children 

416.56 420.26 A: to wear to go out in public and blow themselves up 

419.68 421.32 B: (( what )) 

420.71 424.31 A: and there were children who were taught to do that to wear those 

423.77 426.20 B: oh boy no i missed that 

426.17 431.19 A: they they i don't know if you want to do if you have access to the internet and want to look it up but 

430.99 444.11 A: they're jackets that that have a lot of that c. four explosive and a lot of uh shards of of metal and they are designed to kill the wearer instantaneous of course instantaneously like blow 'em right up but 

435.56 436.33 B: (( mhm )) 

438.61 439.99 B: oh wow 

444.03 452.31 A: they designed it to put the the wearer to a swift death and then just send fragments and fragments and fragments of metal out into everybody else 

452.10 455.26 B: and my guess would be you could buy that on the internet 

452.96 454.02 A: (( absolute )) 

455.46 456.58 A: what did you say 

456.23 459.64 B: my guess would be you could also purchase that on the internet

479.69 480.95 B: (( mhm )) 

480.31 494.38 A: and uh and put put it like a charge to it and [mn] it makes a big bang [laughter] we used to do it a lot when we were kids but but you know we were [laughter] we were only blowing up stumps and stuff [laughter]

496.00 497.90 A: oh i know it's just 

498.09 505.00 A: well the more and more we tick off other nations the more and more we do it the more and more we're gonna see it but 

503.93 516.69 B: you know i hear on the news once um when the when the war first started you know they had uh japanese and all the big emperors and presidents and whatever they had a meeting 

516.92 518.24 B: well um 

518.93 521.66 B: the japanese were saying that uh 

521.72 525.29 B: they didn't think it was time to start the war right then 

526.12 529.22 B: but they were in cooperation with us 

529.66 533.27 B: then the next thing i hear they want to fight too they want to fight us 

529.84 530.73 A: right 

533.77 538.74 B: and i'm like oh my god you know america's going to hell in a handbag 

538.63 551.16 A: uh you know the funny thing is is i think that if you look at even korea korea has got a million plus people there and they're all armed but if you look at what they're armed with 

547.16 548.35 B: (( yes )) 

551.78 560.49 A: you know they they have hardly any capability to go anything long range and we have technology that's far superior to them 

556.83 557.39 B: (( [mn] )) 

560.14 561.37 B: mhm 

560.75 571.84 A: and and that's the thing with with wars these days [laughter] these gonna be a lot of fighting in trenches but a lot of it's going to be taken care of beforehand and that's just it's just downright bloody and nasty it's just 

571.26 573.18 B: yeah it is it is 

572.39 573.91 A: it's horrible but [mn] 

573.52 578.60 B: you know i'm just so surprised too because japan they're the ones that have made the uh
