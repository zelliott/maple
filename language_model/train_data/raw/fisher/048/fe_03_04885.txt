3.88 5.84 A: all right my name is howard 

5.57 10.94 B: okay good good yeah this is ah an interesting topic huh 

11.17 26.13 A: um yeah a little little bit 'cause i don't have real strong feelings about it um [lipsmack] either way i actually had a call about this ah this is my third now so i had one earlier today but we we didn't have any trouble making conversation 

16.46 17.75 B: yeah 

26.01 28.30 B: oh okay and it was on the same topic 

26.77 27.94 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

28.34 31.89 A: yes it was i i guess they just have one topic a day 

29.00 30.09 B: okay 

31.40 34.09 B: [noise] maybe [noise] yeah 

33.47 36.11 A: but i just kept thinking about the o. j. 

35.99 40.13 B: ah okay yeah that came to my mind that was one of the first things that came to my mind too 

36.50 37.50 A: trial 

39.16 40.15 A: right 

40.88 41.83 B: yeah 

40.90 44.55 A: um 'cause i don't really i guess there've been um 

45.00 58.47 A: um there've been other big trials since then but that's the one that i remember and i didn't i wasn't one of those people that watched it every minute of th- the day i had an aunt and that's about all she did for 

58.30 60.04 A: it seems like months 

59.63 68.64 B: yeah people got caught up in that though got really caught up in it it's it's like they almost knew the people you know that were involved um i just think 

61.04 63.24 A: [laughter] that's right 

65.33 66.37 A: mhm 

67.63 73.88 A: oh and they had such wacky characters the kane o'kaylin you know he was sort of the um 

69.58 70.69 B: yeah 

72.12 73.36 B: yeah 

73.93 78.49 A: but i'm sort of um i say overall i i wouldn't ah 

78.97 85.94 A: i'm not really um i wouldn't want them to make it illegal to to broadcast criminal trials usually it's up to the judge 

85.60 86.92 B: okay 

87.20 92.37 A: but some states they they allow it and some states they don't what what do you think 

91.78 98.37 B: well right now i i was reading an article in the new york times and it said that part of the problem um 

98.50 99.87 B: that ah 

99.91 106.18 B: some people have with trials being ah closed is that people need to know 

106.23 108.01 B: ah for instance with fraud 

108.02 111.76 B: and different car companies a lot of them will settle out of court 

111.51 113.13 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

112.15 116.63 B: right they are big they are large corporations but because they have enough money 

116.64 125.94 B: um they settle with the person or a family and even though that car is still out there and someone else is driving that same car with that same problem 

125.81 133.78 B: because it's not televised and because the it's sealed the case is sealed after it's ah decisions is made you know settlement made 

133.81 136.19 B: people don't know so 

136.23 140.51 B: really people with their lives are still jeopardized by secrecy 

140.64 143.58 A: [sigh] yeah that's a that's a um 

144.70 151.38 A: that's a pr- problem with civil trials a lot because in in and what it comes down to is that um 

151.43 162.42 A: in cases like that ones when one side has a whole lot of money to lose because people would buy less cars you know um then ah they've got an incentive to um 

155.22 156.41 B: right 

162.36 170.85 A: even give the other side more than they would ordinarily get be- in order to keep it secret i'm kinda a non practicing lawyer and that is a um 

171.22 176.19 A: a problem with ah civil trials and in tho- in that case it's um 

176.53 182.18 A: it's not even a matter of being televised a a lot a lot of those trials are sort of boring anyway 

181.84 182.86 B: oh 

182.15 195.11 A: that and that's one of the things about the t._v. like if there's a trial involving you know sex or celebrity they want to broadcast it but it might be a lot more important involving something like saf- car safety which affects a whole lot more people than 

187.37 188.41 B: right 

195.24 201.50 A: o. j. or i i dunno some you know there's that woman in san francisco or whatever but 

198.16 199.35 B: yeah 

201.31 203.13 B: that ran over her husband right 

202.48 208.95 A: right but but on the other but what they want to show is the sexy trials not not the ah 

203.15 204.20 B: yeah 

209.02 212.52 A: the more boring ones that involve corporations 

212.02 218.37 B: right well you know we're it's it's a media driven society you know and sensationalism sells now 

212.74 213.99 A: [laughter] 

214.13 215.33 A: (( [noise] )) 

215.55 216.76 A: that's true 

218.39 224.69 B: and ah no matter how you know painful it might be to people that are involved in it you know because 

224.83 225.95 B: you know kids 

226.49 232.28 B: by kids knowing what's going on when their livelihood is exposed so that you still have to go to school 

230.10 231.12 A: (( mhm )) 

232.37 235.98 A: mhm where where you ah located 

232.50 234.56 B: you know and i feel in 

235.47 236.54 B: new york 

236.41 238.50 A: in new york city uh-huh 

237.25 239.20 B: mm well outside of new york 

238.89 241.34 A: uh-huh yeah i i'm in ah washington 

241.03 242.13 B: yeah 

241.50 244.68 A: the other two i talked to have been in l._a. but anyway 

243.67 248.38 B: oh okay yeah they seem to like cover quite a a a wide range of people 

248.73 249.92 B: (( you know )) 

248.73 258.52 A: ah yeah yeah i they they do or i guess in in you know when you sign up they ah identify you that way i mean you have to answer questions about your age and where you're from and all that 

257.78 264.43 B: right right right well the better the cross section the better so that you know i guess for their studies whatever they're trying to 

263.82 266.88 A: [laughter] right [laughter] 

264.54 272.37 B: get out of this you know to see if can can i i'm thinking to myself is it to see that people can really converse no matter what the demographics 

272.76 273.68 B: you know 

273.04 282.94 A: [sigh] i think it's supposed to have something to do with linguistics but i i don't really they're they're pretty um [mn] they don't really say about that so it could be anything 

281.44 282.27 B: yeah 

282.48 283.66 B: yeah 

283.00 286.10 A: but i don't i don't really mind [laughter] you know 

284.55 297.45 B: yeah i think part of it too i was thinking about the cases that have been going on with these cigarette companies i think it was in missouri or minnesota where the judge found in favor of the ah plaintiff against phillip morris 

297.37 304.48 B: i think they had ah set aside some ridiculous amount of money that would have bankrupt the company the corporation totally you 

304.09 306.14 A: (( mhm mhm [noise] )) 

304.60 307.14 B: know and it was um 

307.68 311.37 B: [noise] they you know the attorneys appealed it the appeal was upheld 

311.45 320.22 B: because too many people are affected sometimes with cigarette companies because they are so vast with their enterprises it's not just that they 

320.26 325.00 B: you know produce tobacco products they have so many of their hands in so many other things 

324.40 328.08 A: oh yeah phillip morris has kraft foods yeah tens of thousands 

325.14 326.30 B: right 

326.51 328.69 B: (( yeah that )) 

329.60 343.67 B: would be ah wouldn't have jobs you know it definitely would hit the economy hard for them to have that problem now they have the same thing going on in i think um was it alabama or [noise] one of those southern states with a cigarette company ah 

342.61 351.99 A: of people are affected [noise] but alabama's actually known among lawyers they they have good they get the juries give big awards out there even though it's kind of a conservative you know it is a conservative state but ah yeah 

351.14 353.67 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

352.16 355.00 A: yeah they're it's it's known for that actually 

354.53 369.28 B: yeah well there's money to be made in everything you know there's money to be made they can get the ratings up you know if you can publicize someone that people know or something that happens you know that's a big deal i remember i was thinking um [lipsmack] there was that guy 

357.04 358.52 A: [laughter] 

370.07 371.03 B: that had 

370.10 373.34 A: yeah there i guess there are worse things on television to watch than trials 

373.00 377.11 B: yeah yeah lots most of it ninety nine percent of it i think 

375.89 377.71 A: [laughter] 

377.30 384.58 B: well that guy that had gone on a killing rampages like ah killing like ah he was a homosexual and he killed that guy the ah 

384.68 386.09 B: the d- designer 

386.48 388.14 B: down there in florida 

387.53 389.94 A: oh versace mhm 

388.52 393.84 B: right right yeah 'cause sometimes i i watch ah what do you call it biography 

393.72 394.66 A: uh-huh 

394.12 395.23 B: (( and um )) 

395.47 399.32 B: what do you call it um america's most wanted that kyp- type of thing 

398.84 400.79 A: uh-huh uh-huh [noise] 

400.08 403.76 B: so just about a month or so ago they had that on 

403.78 405.97 B: because i found that to be like wow 

406.28 415.44 B: people are like when they go insane and they flip you just don't really know what's gonna happen you know and sometimes it's good that things like that are on t._v. 

415.56 420.36 B: because again it's like kinda prepares you or forewarns you you know to be a little bit more 

420.77 426.41 B: you gotta watch out for yourself like now with the ah terror alert right what is it we're up to like i think red 

426.56 437.59 A: [noise] [sigh] [sigh] no well we're up to orange red red is i i don't know i don't th- i think red is when they think like it's already happened or something i don't know what a red would be um 

426.77 427.79 B: you know 

427.99 429.88 B: or orange 

435.32 436.55 B: (( orange )) 

437.64 439.12 A: i hate to think 

438.85 452.75 B: yeah yeah but even with nine eleven when that happened and w- we were watching it i was at work and i was like a couple of people called us and said we being bombed we're being bombed i was like thinking to myself what are they talking about we're being bombed there's no wars going on 

451.76 453.39 A: yeah yeah 

452.76 453.79 B: you know 

453.59 457.69 A: where where did you did you work in in ah where did you work 

457.07 460.02 B: well about [noise] well i'm like half an hour away 

459.80 462.18 A: uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh 

460.49 461.55 B: you know 

461.95 463.11 B: (( so ah )) 

463.16 466.59 B: you know when you know people that worked in that that worked there 

466.71 480.97 B: and they're telling you first hand you know and then ah we had a friend that worked right in one of those buildings yeah and so like when we couldn't get through because once something like that happens you know the lines get jammed with so many calls 

472.62 473.73 A: really 

479.99 485.66 A: [sigh] oh yeah well you know i'm in washington and um oh yeah i think our phones were out for ah 

482.66 483.74 B: well you know 

486.51 495.27 A: oh about a week and it ended up uh the internet didn't go out that's how my mom um not that i wouldn't have been at the pentagon anyway but ah 

495.54 498.69 A: oh yeah yeah no i remember that yeah yeah 

497.35 501.13 B: yeah yeah see that was surreal i was like 

501.40 507.93 B: watching it and this is like out of the movies that's what it feels like because it's so so huge you know 

504.87 506.19 A: right 

507.18 515.04 A: i thought for about a split second that it might be a publicity stunt but ah but not for long not for long you know 

510.66 511.82 B: yeah 

511.87 512.75 B: yeah 

513.17 514.12 B: yeah 

514.28 519.74 B: yeah amazing right yeah i think that's been like ah 

516.00 516.93 A: yeah 

516.94 518.15 A: yeah 

519.84 523.23 B: (( i mean that's going to be on the minds of people forever )) 

523.31 524.38 B: you know 

523.33 533.42 A: now that's an example of a trial that won't be when they do musawi they've already said we don't want that to be ah televised because we think it it might ah 

533.63 540.66 A: he might send messages to terrorists or something so that trial is definitely not going to be ah televised 

536.51 537.35 B: yeah 

539.93 554.44 B: yeah i don't think it should be because they they they televised a little bit of what happened with the world trade center earlier those years earlier when the guy had set off a bomb ah under the tr- ah under the building right a little bit you know i mean but i i i think 

541.53 543.09 A: no me neither 

549.40 550.61 A: [noise] i remember that 

550.85 552.03 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

554.55 560.85 B: i think they've learned from that because if you're an extremist and you see someone that had the same thinking 

560.87 569.93 B: you know or maybe someone that you knew even you know you're kinda like getting cheered on here or maybe you're upset because you know it whatever you think of the government 

569.99 573.24 B: you know now i'm going to really like now you're really intent 

573.34 575.96 B: on accomplishing what that other person started 

575.67 577.96 A: [sigh] mhm mhm [sigh] 

576.29 582.81 B: you know like even with timothy mcveigh i swore i said to myself even when that happened in oklahoma like 

582.18 584.43 A: that that trial wasn't televised 

584.48 589.59 B: no but it was insane and pe- people were complaining that it wasn't televised 

584.99 585.94 A: no 

586.24 587.38 A: yeah 

589.79 591.12 B: you know 

589.96 591.86 A: you see i didn't ah 

591.93 594.54 A: i did yeah i i'm like you i didn't ah 

594.65 599.89 A: i i probably would have watched a little bit of it just to sort of see him but but i i didn't mind at all
