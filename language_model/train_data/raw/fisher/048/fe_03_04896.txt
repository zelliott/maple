103.98 105.38 A: that's right 

104.80 106.79 B: you know so um 

106.12 118.42 A: it's a big deal whether it makes any sense to i don't know whether it adds anything that you get to people and it's another channel to watch you know like um whether it serves any you know um 

108.98 109.99 B: yeah 

114.82 115.89 B: yeah 

118.56 122.42 A: any uh civic function you know as far as you know the 

122.70 131.87 A: awa- awakening people or anything because in a way people are just looking you know they get all the wrong effects anyway you know and if you really want to follow the trial you know 

131.58 132.77 B: yeah 

132.02 136.69 A: you know you could either read about it in the paper you know the transcripts or something like that or 

134.61 136.01 B: right 

136.11 137.51 B: mhm 

136.72 142.86 A: or go that route but you know other than that you know people like like something like with uh

157.50 160.76 B: yeah i know you're right yeah 

159.71 163.59 A: so i mean i think it's like if they didn't if they said they weren't gonna have

168.14 170.78 B: yeah i wouldn't either [laughter] 

169.59 181.71 A: i'd be fine with it you know and then some of those things too i mean how about the the i guess those aren't high profile cases that regular televi- that regular television program where judge judy or something like that 

171.13 172.25 B: i know 

180.96 183.02 B: right [laughter]

227.66 228.97 B: you know they should've 

229.31 230.62 B: put that on 

230.73 232.29 A: was that on t._v. 

230.90 232.23 B: (( on t._v. )) 

232.33 237.52 B: yeah it was on t._v. i saw it on uh one of those uh what that channel is where they 

237.85 242.98 B: they have a channel just for where they um televise um 

243.00 251.39 B: like celebrities' you know um trials and stuff and you know when they get in trouble and it was it was on 

245.30 246.46 A: yeah 

247.82 249.18 A: (( yeah i would )) 

251.53 252.71 A: (( yeah i would )) 

251.55 265.29 B: and they had different ones testifying about you know what they saw and how he drove over to her house or something that night you know just giving the you know and the whole trial and it was just so sad it was depressing 

262.09 263.04 A: yeah 

265.18 267.47 A: yeah you're luckier than you think you know 

265.53 266.39 B: (( you know )) 

267.56 271.81 A: okay here's something where it's just you're right it just all of a sudden you're seeing 

271.63 272.87 B: mhm 

271.84 280.84 A: people's lives ruined you know and it's like you know unless you want to sit there and um you know and go and go pray for them or something it's like 

273.53 275.40 B: ruined yeah 

280.61 291.86 A: all you're seeing is this sad story being played out and you've already heard about it and it's like here's two lives ruined is he going he's gonna go to jail for the rest of his life and he had everything going 

283.63 284.82 B: right 

287.24 288.27 B: right 

289.90 291.24 B: right 

291.62 293.26 B: mhm 

291.95 299.48 A: and then you know and here's and here's somebody and he probably re- you know and he screwed up you know i don't know if it deserves that to where you're telling people you know 

299.62 301.55 A: this is how you're gonna 

301.99 312.87 A: i don't think it's a public service though i don't i don't think they want to see i think it's just something to get viewers you know i don't think they're trying to you know help you know the um 

302.20 303.47 B: mhm 

308.01 309.33 B: right 

311.52 312.62 B: yeah 

313.24 316.58 A: (( you know civilization or anything like that yeah )) 

314.23 323.03 B: society [laughter] i know we're pub- like you saying you know with that pub- publicity you know how that um 

321.99 326.35 A: yeah all of that stuff is just selling is just selling uh 

323.07 324.09 B: but 

326.54 329.07 A: the air time and it's basic- 

327.68 330.53 B: yeah and it's really like a um 

330.60 334.32 B: what those um those papers they buy the um 

334.37 335.92 A: yeah the inquirer 

335.01 342.31 B: the star inquirer or just just on tv [laughter] being televised [laughter] 

336.42 337.33 A: yeah 

338.30 339.22 A: yeah 

339.36 350.06 A: exactly because it's like the only reason it's on there is because someone was murdered someone has a lot of money and now someone's got and someone's trying to get away with it you know 

345.85 347.72 B: yeah 

349.61 351.51 B: right yeah 

350.05 354.82 A: and it's like so i mean if it was just something over uh 

354.97 357.22 A: you know somebody nobody knows 

356.97 358.07 B: yeah 

357.39 361.73 A: and it was probably a you know maybe even a more interesting case 

361.74 362.96 B: (( right mhm )) 

361.88 369.29 A: in a sense of of legally i could see that being like brought up as as as something that could be 

369.34 381.68 A: you know leg- where where the legal parameters of it they they're present you know at the at a scenario that uh that could be you know very you know the way it can turn into a um 

381.42 382.66 B: right 

381.82 393.02 A: a case that has you know that that stands as uh you know as a legal precedent some day or something but you know i don't they're not going for that they're just going for the uh the cheap thrill 

386.95 388.81 B: right 

390.15 391.22 B: yeah 

393.08 396.09 A: and um you know and it's so 

393.25 394.99 B: right [laughter] 

396.40 407.61 A: so when it comes i mean i mean as a as a topic that it's a it's a no brainer for me i mean i'm not gonna spend you know if it comes down to it i ca- i don't care if i ever see 

407.64 408.58 A: a 

409.11 412.17 A: a trial on tele- televised 

411.64 414.46 B: on telev- yeah televised on 

413.09 425.26 A: you know although the one the next one that probably would would be that they'd be trying to pitch is this one for this guy lacey out in california who said he was out fishing you know and he didn't know where his wife was 

421.08 422.70 B: oh okay 

423.20 424.62 B: yeah 

424.84 426.30 B: right 

425.25 440.18 A: now that's a perfect set up for for for trying to do that but i mean all all that is is like a television show done because everybody figures the guy's guilty so they're gonna say well how's he gonna wh- what are his lawyers gonna do to try and get away with it 

429.12 430.15 B: mhm 

432.99 434.29 B: right 

435.48 436.67 B: guilty 

439.59 440.93 B: mhm 

440.20 441.68 A: so i mean 

441.45 447.36 A: yeah [laughter] there's a case too where you have you have screw- you know lives all screwed up 

442.62 443.86 B: i know 

446.79 448.16 B: yeah 

447.13 459.66 A: yet you know there's a there's a reason and it and it's all like um excitement i mean i don't i mean it's like to find out whether he gets it is the same thing as finding the ending of a uh television show 

452.85 454.61 B: right yeah 

457.44 458.96 B: right 

459.21 465.11 B: yeah yeah and you know that's that's um that's true i uh 

460.81 461.63 A: so 

465.32 478.04 B: i'd particularly you know i don't i don't know i you know i see it at times but you know i don't really care for it because like i say you know it's when i'm watching it you know it's just 

478.05 482.14 B: 'cause there's a lot of things on t._v. that's depressing [laughter] 

481.33 482.35 A: there is 

482.43 484.27 B: [laughter] but you know 

482.62 487.88 A: you know but if you turn the t._v. set off and you understand and you appreciate that quiet 

487.73 494.31 B: oh yes yes it makes a big difference and i've actually done that at times you know just 

487.91 488.78 A: (( you know )) 

493.22 494.19 A: yeah 

494.32 496.77 B: i myself i don't really watch a 

496.87 508.14 B: a whole lot of t._v. you know and i i may like when i get off and come home i may sit and watch i like watching the news now i i you know try to catch the news 

498.36 499.37 A: yeah 

502.29 503.35 A: yeah 

508.03 514.99 B: and see what's going on in the world you know and then uh i may watch one one or two shows 

510.00 511.04 A: (( mhm ))
