3.11 5.12 B: hi my name is julie 

5.25 6.29 A: hi julie 

5.96 13.82 B: hello [laughter] um i guess the topic is high profile trials if it should be televised er 

15.07 17.90 A: right yeah you ever watched those things 

15.83 17.07 B: [laughter] 

17.67 19.05 B: um [sigh] 

19.56 28.53 B: not really like maybe once or twice just for curiosity and then i'll switch the channel [laughter] do you like them 

24.19 25.14 A: uh-huh 

26.53 28.81 A: [laughter] yeah 

28.73 29.81 B: yeah 

29.01 32.44 A: nah yeah i can't say i've really followed any of them i know when 

32.64 42.88 A: o. j. was being tried i didn't i didn't watch i didn't hardly even know what was going on that was [cough] too busy with the rest of my life [laughter] um yeah 

37.07 38.83 B: oh really wow 

39.82 41.74 B: (( [laughter] wow )) 

41.97 42.82 B: (( oh )) 

42.84 44.28 B: gosh yeah 

44.33 50.38 B: i i guess i don't care either way [laughter] for me because um 

50.52 56.34 B: i think you know just because they're famous they shouldn't really have their lives publicly 

56.93 58.44 B: publicized 

58.66 61.51 B: and advertised you know through the media 

61.74 64.97 B: like i i think i watch a little bit of um 

65.09 67.03 B: what's her name winona 

67.41 70.35 A: mhm oh yeah was she 

67.49 68.82 B: wh- ryder 

68.99 77.99 B: yeah and that was yeah that wasn't because you know i was interested just that you know family was watching it and you're stuck watching it and going mhm 

76.27 77.22 A: right 

78.27 78.99 B: [laughter] 

78.60 79.59 A: (( right i )) 

79.38 81.08 B: yeah so i 

80.37 89.81 A: don't i yeah hm i i guess when i think about it i think that it at one level it is a matter of public record 

82.83 83.66 B: mm 

83.67 84.33 B: so 

89.98 90.95 B: yeah 

90.09 94.65 A: when you go to trial i mean it is it's not something that's done behind closed doors 

94.69 95.78 B: right 

95.18 103.33 A: so if if you want to go and view it and there's opportunity to view you know if you if you're curious you can go if there's room in the court room 

101.63 102.69 B: right 

103.13 104.74 B: right right 

103.85 106.27 A: and if there's not should it um 

106.78 110.14 A: you know should they put it on television if there's enough people that are interested 

110.54 111.59 B: yeah 

110.54 114.53 A: yeah i suppose so i mean is it something personally i'm going to go and 

111.62 112.72 B: [laughter] 

114.91 116.12 A: and view 

116.18 122.79 A: not really in in if it's something that ah pertains to be me directly that i'll be affected by the outcome 

122.79 124.43 B: right right 

123.67 126.11 A: then i'd i'd want to be able to see it sure 

125.73 127.82 B: right right but 

127.53 131.54 A: but i don't think the government should um necessarily 

131.87 135.09 A: well that's another question should the government go ahead and televise these 

135.62 143.37 B: yeah yeah i i don't know if i don't think that they actually you know pay anything or if they have any 

143.54 146.73 B: monetary rewards for televising 

147.15 148.47 B: that's probably just 

147.82 149.42 A: (( [sigh] yeah yeah )) 

148.84 151.70 B: yeah the t._v. companies [sigh] 

151.13 158.03 A: right well for something where it's ah you know somebody a public figure and there's going to be a lot of people watching then 

157.70 158.80 B: yeah 

158.05 163.50 A: of course there's you know opportunity there to make money and that's when the networks will pick up on it then 

162.94 164.26 B: (( exactly )) 

163.59 170.01 A: if it's just you know your next door neighbor you know well say that he's a burglar or something like that and you you know he's being tried 

170.22 172.24 A: should they have that you know on t._v. 

171.11 173.94 B: [noise] [laughter] [laughter] yeah right 

173.03 178.71 A: and i think i think not i think there's you know the people that are interested in that are going to go down and see it 

178.84 179.90 B: yeah 

179.18 180.41 A: end of story 

181.18 186.02 B: i think they've tried that with i'm on the phone honey one second um 

186.19 188.65 B: they've tried that with real t._v. 

188.74 190.71 B: where i think they had trials 

190.61 192.17 A: uh-huh yeah 

191.32 197.26 B: and i dunno i don't think it did that well because people aren't really interested unless it is a high profile [laughter] 

196.65 201.39 A: [mn] [laughter] well wasn't there a like court t._v. channel for a while 

200.46 204.45 B: yeah did you watch that 

201.44 202.57 A: yeah 

203.85 216.79 A: um no but i i passed by it so to speak i knew it existed and i might look for about thirty seconds and say well that's okay that's kinda slow [laughter] and move on to the next thing so 

208.72 209.87 B: yeah 

214.30 215.26 B: yeah 

216.36 217.89 B: exactly yeah 

217.58 224.15 A: usually though yeah a court case usually is something that does happen pretty slowly they're they're really methodical 

224.55 225.89 B: yeah 

224.62 229.15 A: so it's not really all that exciting unless you speed it up [laughter] 

227.18 228.29 B: no 

228.41 234.67 B: [laughter] no you know edit this out [laughter] and yeah yeah 

230.04 230.90 A: yeah 

232.23 233.08 A: yeah 

234.31 246.24 A: so i don't think the government should should publish them or or broadcast them i don't think there's a need for that i think there is a need for the public to be able to see it if um there's enough people interested and they can't sit in the court room 

239.50 240.42 B: no 

246.34 249.25 A: and somebody wants to publicize it um 

246.53 247.48 B: yeah 

249.54 252.17 A: you know i think that's that's probably okay 

252.39 258.99 A: so you know when you look at those people they're just observers they're not participants they don't have any you know they don't 

255.31 256.16 B: mhm 

259.44 262.85 A: ah affect the outcome of the case or anything like that so 

262.64 265.71 B: yeah yeah yeah sometimes 

264.71 265.65 A: and 

265.95 274.43 B: to me it's just wow like you know cases where ah was it i think i i remember robert downey junior 

268.41 269.23 A: yeah 

274.16 275.69 A: oh yeah uh-huh 

274.83 275.75 B: too 

275.78 281.33 B: and i just thought well that's way too much [laughter] i don't want to know about him [laughter] 

278.95 279.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

280.35 282.16 A: yeah right right 

281.35 283.20 B: yeah yeah 

282.78 288.88 A: and on the other hand is you know do we have a a right to know those things and like i said it is a public trial so 

288.15 289.68 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

289.42 290.47 A: so we do 

290.73 292.33 B: we we have the right 

291.03 296.39 A: do we do we want to know those things i i agree with you i don't personally really care but [noise] 

292.84 294.25 B: no [laughter] 

296.25 298.48 B: yeah yeah 

297.22 298.51 A: yeah some 

298.65 304.59 B: just imagine if if they publicized your trial if you know if you happen to be on trial 

303.36 305.55 A: yeah right uh yeah 

304.95 308.36 B: that would be like ugh [laughter] 

307.70 311.59 A: well it's it's a public situation you know anybody can come and watch 

311.31 313.49 B: yeah that's true that's true 

313.51 314.71 A: yeah mhm 

314.55 316.50 B: (( yep you're right you're right )) 

315.56 320.62 A: well i mean that's one of the i i dunno if that's one of the deterrents you know for people that you know 

320.75 323.31 A: jail is probably the bigger deterrent but 

323.16 324.76 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

323.49 327.27 A: you know the threat of being you know having to go to trial and and 

327.30 329.51 A: go through that whole public thing 

327.30 328.32 B: yeah 

329.53 330.71 A: yeah 

329.66 334.14 B: yeah i pro- they don't even think about who's watching probably when they're 

334.34 347.64 B: you know committing whatever a crime [laughter] yeah and plus all and i think i mean i'm one of those people that don't really want to go as a jury [laughter] i mean as jury duty i'm going well you know 

335.51 338.15 A: yeah right right right exactly 

344.91 345.87 A: (( yeah )) 

347.84 358.61 B: and that's that's you know you you actually have to do it versus who would go voluntarily just to watch a case that which is very dry and boring 

355.93 357.02 A: yeah 

358.48 365.66 A: well some people they really love the law they are interested in that kinda thing and they'll they're there's groupies that they go do that kinda thing 

361.55 363.05 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

365.41 370.37 B: law groupies i didn't know that [laughter] 

367.07 371.43 A: ah trial groupies yeah [laughter] oh there there's groupies for everything i think 

370.62 373.12 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

372.48 383.63 A: i guess the other thing to think about is if you're a member of the jury um you know how does that infringe upon you a- again i don't think it does again it's a public it's a public service 

383.26 384.14 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

383.82 388.18 A: it's something that um you know everybody's really kinda signed up to do 

388.76 393.04 A: and it's just one of those it's what makes you know part of the system work 

392.76 395.21 B: yeah that's true that's true 

393.38 398.36 A: um you know it it's should they pub- again should they put it on t._v. 

398.49 401.22 A: if enough people want to see it yeah they should 

401.40 402.93 B: (( yeah )) 

401.86 403.75 A: that's what i'm concluding i 

403.59 405.68 B: okay okay like it's 

404.71 407.10 A: but that's just me [laughter] 

406.18 412.75 B: [laughter] i could care either way [laughter] um you know 'cause yeah i think 

409.20 410.59 A: yeah yeah 

412.71 421.36 B: it it it depends like you said it was um it's for the public and it's open for the public it just feels 

418.05 418.86 A: (( mhm )) 

419.87 421.09 A: (( mhm it is )) 

422.27 434.27 B: intruding still in terms of the fact that just because you're a high profile your whole life is exposed to the world whilst on trial you know 

432.24 433.45 A: mhm 

434.32 443.01 B: people usually go in to watch because they're interested and not because they're just clicking on a channel [laughter] and going oh 

438.62 439.47 A: right 

441.44 444.29 A: yeah right in right yeah 

443.45 447.98 B: yeah yeah although o. j. though that was a pretty important case 

448.25 449.28 B: because 

448.61 451.50 A: well it sure was for him [laughter] 

450.59 452.75 B: yeah [laughter] 

451.82 460.29 A: and i guess it was for you know the family of you know the the wife that was killed um and at one level it became important for 

456.60 457.69 B: (( yeah )) 

460.47 464.39 A: it even became a racial situation to a certain degree down in los angeles 

462.76 464.68 B: it did it did 

464.87 465.86 B: i think 

465.20 470.63 A: and it was it was interesting because i i don't know how they turned that into a you know a race trial but 

470.72 477.79 B: i think it was because was this the same time as the riot with um um [mn] rodney king 

476.31 478.88 A: well the riot occurred right after that i thought 

478.72 483.04 B: was it right after oh that's right so it became a reg- 

481.74 485.54 A: yeah as a result as a result of the verdict i thought 

484.68 491.82 B: that's right i forgot all about that seems like so long ago people got angry that he was guilty 

487.19 487.96 A: (( yeah )) 

488.91 489.81 A: yeah 

491.93 492.73 B: [laughter] 

491.95 497.36 A: well i think people would get angry either way whether he was acquitted or whether he was found guilty 

497.26 498.21 B: yeah 

497.46 500.21 A: you gonna have people get angry no matter what 

499.72 501.61 B: yeah yeah 

501.05 502.65 A: i dunno it's 

502.56 504.03 B: yeah that's a whole 

502.96 508.87 A: and is is that fault of the fact that he's being tried and they're televising it [lipsmack] no not necessarily 

507.95 510.54 B: (( mm mm maybe )) 

509.31 513.48 A: because they could have had the same anger if it was you know written up in a newspaper 

513.69 515.14 B: (( [laughter] i dunno )) 

514.03 516.58 A: they were waiting for the they were waiting for the result 

516.50 519.56 B: (( yeah no i dunno because because )) 

519.71 523.09 B: um televised has that immediate 

522.36 525.52 A: (( mm yeah mhm yeah [mn] )) 

523.18 524.71 B: (( kinda response )) 

524.85 537.67 B: so i would think that if you read it i wouldn't have the same reaction i don't think there'd be crowds of people turning over trucks and throwing bombs you know or whatever they did [noise] which was pretty scary at the time 

537.01 544.88 A: it was pretty scary yeah i dun- i don't like i said i don't know how that turned turned the way it did because i didn't think it was a racial situation at all but 

544.94 550.01 B: just i think it was just because he was black and she you know was white 

549.69 554.92 A: oh yeah okay that probably began it or could have entered [noise] into it sure i hadn't thought of that 

553.92 558.41 B: yeah yeah and so people just you know just because of the color 

558.67 559.52 B: um 

558.85 560.93 A: ah right right 

560.03 568.84 B: of the they're just racial so of course you know just because of that because i don't think there was anything really racially 

562.52 563.36 A: yeah 

565.43 566.22 A: yeah 

568.87 569.76 B: um 

569.89 573.49 A: [sigh] no i think he was a suspect for a good reason [laughter] 

570.51 571.32 B: (( hello )) 

572.72 580.27 B: yeah yeah yeah i think we all think that he's guilty [laughter] even if he's vindicated yeah i mean 

579.42 587.48 A: well yeah i mean he's he's he was proven to be not guilty in criminal law in civil law there i think they actually found him guilty 

584.37 585.49 B: right 

586.84 590.06 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

589.39 589.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

590.27 592.28 B: yeah well you followed that case 

591.16 592.20 A: yeah so 

592.48 593.39 A: yeah 

593.31 594.48 B: yeah 

594.04 595.61 A: what else to talk about 

595.41 596.80 B: (( [sigh] i don't )) 

595.80 597.89 A: were there any other questions in there 

597.63 599.95 B: um no that was it
