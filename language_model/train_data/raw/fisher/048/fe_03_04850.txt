0.00 1.33 B: (( i'm benjamin )) 

0.87 2.22 A: hi this is mike 

2.11 3.87 B: hey mike how's it going 

3.14 4.59 A: pretty good how are you doing 

4.08 5.38 B: i'm doing okay 

5.16 7.65 A: good have you been doing this for long 

7.42 10.06 B: no this is actually the first call i've received 

9.54 10.63 A: oh okay 

10.59 11.74 B: (( so [sigh] )) 

11.33 13.16 A: well this is my second call so 

12.93 16.07 B: oh okay well you're a seasoned veteran then [lipsmack] 

16.13 17.18 B: so 

16.50 18.53 A: yeah i would have to say so [laughter] 

18.17 21.96 B: yeah well it doesn't seem too hard we've gotta talk about uh 

22.01 27.99 B: my personal opinion is uh yeah they've remained calm i think nine eleven showed us that [lipsmack] there 

26.83 28.34 A: um well 

28.02 31.09 B: wasn't a lotta panic involved in that everybody pretty much 

31.61 34.01 B: did what they could 

32.95 37.22 A: i think basically what happened with nine eleven is people were just in shock 

37.69 39.62 B: well yeah 

37.89 43.14 A: 'cause all all they were doing was looking up in the air and and seeing that there wasn't really much they could do it 

42.66 51.82 B: but but i think the people who were affected the most in in the in the service personnel who who responded to it all acted very calmly considering 

51.23 54.03 A: [mn] that's all true that's true but then again 

53.32 54.12 B: so 

54.08 56.19 A: [mn] it's all after the fact 

55.92 59.04 B: (( yes well )) 

56.29 59.39 A: you know we can't really say what happened except for that one 

59.42 60.39 A: uh 

59.69 64.58 B: well for that matter it's all before the fact we don't know how people have react nowadays so 

60.45 61.99 A: plane that crashed 

63.69 64.98 A: right 

64.92 69.95 B: [lipsmack] uh you know it it really depends on uh i guess 

69.36 71.86 A: i think it depends on the group of people you've got 

71.23 79.44 B: well that that too i think it depends on a lot of different factors i mean if you're attacking people you know in a business setting versus uh 

79.49 88.27 B: you know like a a mall or something there may be a wide variety of difference or you know for that matter an airplane versus a bus who knows you know [mn] 

81.65 82.72 A: right 

88.16 98.58 B: um in the end uh i guess you know it just comes down to who the people are that you have it's not even so much the group of people it's the individuals that are within it 

97.28 104.02 A: [noise] right i i think basically what happens is at first people will be shocked and then i think maybe they'll be mad 

104.35 107.00 B: well that's that's after the fact they're 

105.90 110.00 A: no no no i'm talking about during the attack like as soon as it it hit while it's happening 

109.67 112.61 B: well i i think that would depend also on where you are 

110.15 111.08 A: (( you know )) 

113.32 116.13 B: um you know i i don't think anger 

116.52 122.59 B: would be something that would enter into the equation to me until after the fact not during the fact for sure 

122.93 125.44 B: uh you know unless of course um 

126.49 131.11 B: uh you know unless of course i was able to do something to you know 

132.20 133.63 B: i guess uh 

134.06 138.45 B: you know to modify the situation so to speak so 

138.01 148.90 A: i don't know speaking personally i think yeah at first if if i'm in the middle of an attack then like i said it all depends on how they're attacking too if i'm in the middle of a mall and they're just coming out of nowhere 

144.99 153.16 B: yeah well if they're just splaying out machine gun fire then the only thing i'm gonna react with is fear and getting my head down but 

149.55 150.73 A: right 

152.41 153.95 A: exactly 

153.11 167.06 B: [laughter] unless i find an opportunity to save lives in which case i'm going to dive you know [laughter] but you know um other than it it's like uh you know i mean you know i mean it really depends on the situation i guess you know 

154.27 155.16 A: but 

158.49 160.42 A: exactly yeah 

167.48 172.60 B: you know if it's if it's on a plane i'm gonna do exactly what those people over pennsylvania did you know 

171.85 175.69 A: yeah right 'cause you know you're going to die anyway so you might as well do something 

173.41 180.05 B: yeah it's like well let's see they're prob- we're probably going to go down we might as well save some lives while we're at it let's rush the cockpit 

179.70 181.49 A: (( right )) 

180.31 181.82 B: (( [laughter] so )) 

182.10 191.33 A: and nowadays the the way they're doing it is just with the car bombs so there's really no way to react to that so i think it's just gonna be a widespread panic as as soon as it hits 

190.74 201.26 B: i still think i think fear would be predominant but i don't think panic would necessarily ensue i i think people in this day and age are prepared for that kinda thing to the degree that they'd be able to 

201.13 207.54 B: you know at least you know to the for their own safety and the safety of others be able to react to that in a positive way 

207.48 216.35 A: i don't know i still think people in this country um even after the nine eleven fact still think that we're untouchable so i think 

215.09 217.90 B: i don't think that's true i 

216.52 219.60 A: uh i don't know i don't know well i i'm in uh ch- 

218.63 222.38 B: i have relatives in new york i'll tell you [laughter] i don't think that's true that's 

221.20 224.44 A: really well yeah like i said i'm in chicago 

224.19 225.55 B: yeah 

224.52 234.87 A: and basically uh they had the barricades up and people are walking around like it's like you know every day nobody's really paying attention and actually people are kind of annoyed 

231.94 233.14 B: well i think 

234.29 239.59 B: i think that i i think that what you're talking about more relates to the fact that the government wants to 

239.52 252.65 B: play yoyo with the terror alert you know i mean you know one day we're orange then we're red then we're orange then we're red then we're yellow then we're orange then we're red you know it's their you know and they issue these broad 

252.68 254.43 B: terrorist warnings 

254.22 262.30 A: right i i think it's come to the fact that um it doesn't really matter what alert we're at the public right now is basically oh okay that's nice 

262.03 271.11 B: well they're just they're desensitized to the whole thing they're they're and that's gonna affect the way people react too of course but you know in the end it's uh 

262.57 263.53 A: (( you know )) 

264.26 265.58 A: right 

271.40 280.78 B: you know it it really just depends on i think the individual person and and what their life experience is and you know kinda [mn] you know what the fiber of their being is for that matter 

279.84 281.98 A: right exactly 

281.53 283.76 B: so i mean you know you can be 

283.77 288.94 B: the biggest toughest guy on the face of the planet and something like that happens and all of a sudden 

288.58 292.60 A: yeah you're really like a little schoolgirl [laughter] yeah 

289.44 298.34 B: you know yeah you're a little schoolgirl whereas the wimpy geek who you know weighed ninety eight pounds all his life is you know rushing in to save the day so [laughter] 

297.36 298.82 A: right exactly 

298.78 308.50 B: i mean that again i mean some of the guys that were up on those planes some of the guys that were down on the ground were the ones that you never expected to do that kinda thing and there they were so 

307.30 308.36 A: that's true 

309.41 317.21 B: [sigh] you know it really does depend on who you are what you do you know who you know what your life experience is everything so 

318.54 323.02 B: it's oh one of my kids is crying [laughter] but uh 

320.46 322.19 A: oh [laughter] 

324.03 326.70 B: [noise] yeah so 

327.86 331.43 A: yeah what was the other question that they wanted us to address or was that basically it 

330.74 334.60 B: i think that was it we just have to try and fill like ten minutes so 

333.45 336.70 A: (( ten minutes right and it's only been five [laughter] )) 

334.89 335.74 B: um 

336.19 345.45 B: great um but yeah i mean in this day and age that's that's the way it is you know i mean 

344.41 345.42 A: mhm 

346.39 351.13 B: in in this day and age that's how people handle that kinda thing 

350.60 352.76 A: i think also people 

351.17 352.21 B: so 

353.51 361.13 A: that that uh probably the kinda news after they watch if we do get attacked after they watch it there would be a big uh outrage 

361.11 367.53 B: [mn] well that for sure but i mean you know the main question here was you know how do ya think people would react during an attack 

367.56 381.16 B: and i think it depends on you know a a number of factors i mean okay first of all where are within the the attack are you within the attack are you directly outside the attack are you [mn] i mean watching it as it occurs on the news you know 

374.04 374.91 A: (( right exactly )) 

381.38 383.38 A: yeah i think they probably mean 

381.45 392.10 B: uh you know and and your reaction is gonna be different regard you know regarding where you are then you have to take you know within each of those situations you have to take in a number of considerations what uh 

392.33 404.95 B: you know okay i'm outside of the attack and i can see the attack happening with my eyes um my personal first reaction would be to get closer and see if there's anything i can do to help the people who are being attacked 

404.63 405.55 A: right 

404.96 406.49 B: you know uh 

406.63 412.92 B: you know whereas somebody else's reaction may be to turn tail and get the flock out of town you know 

412.90 420.32 A: yeah it it also depends on who you're with if you're there with your family i think like if i'm there with my family my first inclination is get them outta there you know 

412.98 414.13 B: um 

420.18 427.45 B: well for sure yeah for sure there's no question there um you know and that's another thing that would matter if 

427.40 438.17 B: my family were threatened uh in any way shape or form my first thing to do would be disable whoever was doing that at all costs you know [laughter] so you know i mean that would be you know 

433.29 434.11 A: right 

438.37 442.69 B: whether you know whether it was machine gun fire or rocket fire or whatever you know [laughter] 

442.73 452.66 B: yeah i might end up splattered across the floor but i'm gonna do my best in the process you know bill cosby had the right idea with the whole elevator going down thing he says you know i may you know 

445.24 445.97 A: right 

446.10 447.34 A: (( that's right )) 

452.66 453.63 A: (( what did he say )) 

452.71 466.75 B: the first thing before it hits the ground i'm gonna jump up in the air and it might not work it might not work at all but and they may see ten bodies all crumpled up at the bottom and one head sticking out the top but they will see me and he sure did try you know [laughter] yeah exactly you know 

460.84 462.90 A: that's right [laughter] 

463.70 465.48 A: what have you got to lose right 

467.33 472.77 B: and that's i mean i think that was the mentality of the people you know over the air in pennsylvania you know 

472.95 474.98 B: was you know we're gonna try 

474.68 475.70 A: mhm 

475.15 481.17 B: and that's you know again that's that's i mean that took coordination it took you know they didn't just 

476.23 477.76 A: nothing to lose 

481.22 489.46 B: if they just all just hey let's do it you know it would've failed you know that took coordination it took a lot of cunning on their part and that shows a calmness 

489.53 490.90 B: that you know 

490.91 497.16 B: you wouldn't expect maybe but that you know i think would happen more often than you think you know 

495.32 496.44 A: (( mhm right )) 

496.46 500.35 A: yeah i think they just accepted their fate and said hey this is what we have to do 

500.02 505.99 B: well yeah and but they they did more than that because they were calm about it and they actually took the time to 

506.03 511.06 B: to coordinate and attack a counter attack basically on those terrorists 

510.80 514.64 A: yeah well i don't know if they took their time we don't know how much time they actually had between 

513.71 516.05 B: actually we have quite a bit of they 

516.06 516.62 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

516.82 521.33 B: they there there is quite a bit of data on that um um yeah there's 

519.35 522.27 A: is there i i only saw like the the 

521.68 532.59 B: there were conversations where they said we're planning on attacking the cockpit that they had had over the cell phones that they allowed the people to call yeah they they said to those people that we are going to rush the cockpit 

526.77 527.93 A: oh really 

532.84 534.72 B: and actually it was a 

533.12 537.69 A: yeah i i know that they had said that but i i wasn't sure how much time they had to plan 

535.61 544.00 B: well it was the terrorists' mistake of of letting them get together and and use each other's cell phones to call their relatives that allowed them to pull that off 

543.39 544.58 A: right 

544.21 550.66 B: you know not that that's a horrible mistake to make at least for us but you know uh [laughter] 

547.06 548.76 A: [laughter] 

548.95 551.68 A: but if you're a terrorist it's not a good idea 

550.84 557.26 B: if you were one of those guys on that plane who was trying to crash that into the white house then yes uh sorry [laughter] you lose 

555.72 558.23 A: [laughter] that's right 

557.69 569.31 B: you know and and then we don't know exactly what happened on those other planes uh the other two planes or three planes uh you know those people may may have uh panicked or they just may not have been able to respond 

569.05 570.02 A: right 

569.43 571.41 B: you know and since they 

571.81 578.45 B: [sigh] pretty much all burned up with the with the program there uh there's no way to even tell they may have been dead you know 

578.37 581.10 A: right yeah who who knows what happened there 

578.53 579.84 B: it's hard to say 

580.50 581.58 B: so 

581.73 585.09 B: just a cheery subject that they want us talk about here huh 

584.37 590.58 A: yeah tell me about it [laughter] and i like the way they don't give us any extra variables you know just a broad 

589.37 596.54 B: yeah well i think they're counting on those to come in on their own i mean i don't think they expect you to stay one hundred percent on topic because 

592.21 593.22 A: yeah 

596.61 598.57 B: uh i mean 

598.91 599.95 B: i don't know it just seems
