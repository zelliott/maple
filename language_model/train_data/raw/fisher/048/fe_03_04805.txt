82.16 83.09 B: yeah 

85.62 86.54 B: really 

87.30 89.86 B: oh see now i don't like camel very much 

89.84 90.83 A: (( right )) 

90.95 97.73 A: but they're talking about the various smoking bans and i guess they wanna hear something from us on that 

94.11 95.13 B: yeah 

96.13 97.65 B: yeah 

97.76 98.92 A: generally 

99.19 103.15 A: i don't really care i mean i the the i'm in new york 

102.95 103.92 B: mhm 

103.79 104.73 A: (( where are you )) 

104.93 106.04 B: arizona 

106.22 110.17 A: okay well in new york we've got bans on smoking almost everywhere now 

110.78 116.28 B: yeah see now i i wouldn't have figured it would affect and i know i used to live in california 

116.68 117.87 B: and uh 

117.28 119.05 A: ah smoking nazis 

118.75 128.12 B: yes oh yes and uh i live in arizona now but it's slowly creeping this way and i just went on vacation there and i just felt like i was in a communist country or something 

121.62 122.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

129.14 135.05 A: i don't mind the bans in most places but if you go in to a bar to have a drink i want to be able to have a cigarette 

134.78 135.84 B: mhm 

135.53 142.04 A: but in new york city you can't do that and it's gonna be the whole state in about a month or so about two months is it the end of july 

140.94 143.50 B: now wait a minute so they are banning it there 

143.27 144.79 A: (( yeah )) 

144.13 147.95 B: oh i thought they were not now that's surprising so 

148.65 149.55 A: yeah 

148.96 151.11 B: you can't smoke even in a bar 

150.73 151.30 A: [mn] 

151.45 161.09 A: from what i understand in in the city now uh wh- what i understand the state's gonna have the same sort of rules but it's theirs start i think either the beginning of july or end of july 

160.86 162.31 B: oh that's awful 

162.51 163.64 A: yeah 

163.70 166.30 A: how well they'll be enforced is another question 

166.22 167.06 B: huh 

166.78 169.89 A: how well they will be enforced is another question 

169.30 171.25 B: well yeah exactly 

171.53 174.77 B: they've tried to do it here in arizona and they 

174.79 183.18 B: they started originally banning it and then they ended up having to pull back and change some of the laws because people just 

183.35 186.03 B: it was making businesses shut down 

186.28 194.37 B: and uh things like that so they started doing it so that there's a separate area for them to smoke uh like the bar area and then everything else 

195.20 200.69 A: mm like like uh that i don't mind because i don't like smoking when i'm eating 

197.89 198.73 B: yeah 

200.51 201.45 B: yeah 

200.95 202.64 A: and the smell of it 

202.95 207.46 A: if it's right on top of me kind of bothers me when i'm eating 

204.58 205.47 B: yeah 

207.12 208.08 B: yeah 

207.81 213.07 A: but i know after i've eaten i want that cigarette actually i prefer a cigar but you 

210.40 211.50 B: mhm 

213.21 214.21 B: yeah 

214.22 215.15 A: (( know )) 

214.42 222.73 B: yeah i definitely agree that it i mean it should just be in one area and people who are off you know in the non smoking area who are eating and stuff shouldn't have to breathe it 

223.80 225.11 B: but uh 

226.70 236.70 B: yeah i don't yeah i just i one thing they're doing with the banning though is i think they've taken it to an extreme i know like in california it's hard even to find places outside to smoke 

238.08 243.25 B: i mean it gets to the point where it's difficult to even find an outside area to go to [noise] 

243.39 250.98 A: well they're trying to do that here [noise] i mean i think they've ban it at like outside arenas at baseball [sigh] 

251.70 253.27 A: stadiums 

252.67 259.87 B: [noise] yeah boy i never knew that i thought that uh i would have thought that that would not happen in new york 

260.05 267.06 B: i've never been there but well not like new york city area i've never been there but uh i don't know i just never would have imagined they would have done it there 

267.58 272.42 A: well well they're trying to do it everywhere 

268.52 269.63 B: interesting 

270.38 271.59 B: (( mm but uh )) 

272.66 274.18 B: yeah i guess so 

274.56 279.96 A: so what bans if any do they have on or going into effect down where you are 

279.68 282.65 B: um they pretty much just have it uh 

283.62 286.33 B: they're doing it kind of city by city i think 

286.51 288.06 B: and uh 

288.14 292.99 B: they've hit two cities so far i know they're gonna start working on the other cities 

293.18 300.17 B: but uh they just basically do it so that you can't smoke i think it's uh five hundred feet from the building 

300.68 304.31 B: um you have to go five hundred feet away um 

304.50 307.04 B: and only certain restaurants after 

307.09 314.42 B: they did a law and then they changed it back where they have certain restaurants have enclosed bar areas where you can go in and smoke in there 

315.30 320.82 B: but aside from that i know one of the cities there's just no smoking period anymore 

320.81 321.79 A: okay 

321.80 323.07 A: uh 

323.28 327.88 A: i gath- let me ask you well let me not gather anything do you work 

327.85 328.59 B: yes 

328.86 331.19 A: how about on the job well 

330.35 336.02 B: well i actually i'm a freelance writer so i i work from home so i don't have to worry about that thankfully 

336.33 340.10 B: now i do know uh the job i had before um 

340.17 344.19 B: they had uh a smoking area outside 

344.63 347.33 B: and as far as i know they still have it 

348.11 348.99 B: (( uh )) 

349.12 352.66 B: i know that they generally in certain cities 

352.81 358.43 B: will have uh smoking areas outside of the job place i'm not sure if they've changed that though 

358.40 362.91 A: out here there's no designated area but the streets are still 

363.04 364.93 A: generally free to smoke in 

365.27 370.65 B: wow you can even like if you're work is not even a designated area you have to basically go out to the street 

365.78 366.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

370.22 372.42 A: (( well basically i have to go out of the building )) 

372.20 374.60 B: wow that's got to be frustrating 

375.98 379.15 A: well it helps to cut down i guess mm it's 

378.08 379.07 B: mhm 

379.59 381.54 B: that's a good way to look at it 

382.17 384.76 A: not like i have a choice [laughter] 

384.09 385.19 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

385.42 395.04 A: i want i'm trying to remember if i put smoking down when they gave me the general criterion originally to see if they pick smokers to see how smokers respond to it 

395.05 395.91 A: or 

396.54 397.11 A: (( [mn] )) 

397.26 398.96 A: 'cause we're both smokers 

398.35 399.47 B: yeah 

399.37 401.16 A: [mn] or is that just a fluke 

401.10 405.92 B: i think it's just a fluke 'cause i don't i didn't remember anything like that on the 

405.95 409.81 B: on the questionnaire actually i just signed up today so 

409.07 410.23 A: (( oh okay )) 

410.31 412.60 B: do you know how many times you can do this 

413.11 422.64 A: [sigh] uh so far they've except for yesterday because i was out they've gotten me every day this week yeah 

419.90 420.88 B: oh really 

421.44 423.15 B: can you do more than once a day 

422.89 428.97 A: uh you'd have to work back through them i think you can but i don't know and i don't know how that works 

428.60 430.41 B: oh okay i was just curious 

431.05 433.18 A: why you need to buy another pack of cigarettes 

431.11 432.13 B: but uh 

433.37 435.56 B: what's yeah [laughter] 

435.75 438.92 B: get some money for those cigarettes yeah they're so costly 

438.55 442.55 A: mm that's too it's seven dollars or better here in the city 

441.96 444.67 B: oh my gosh are you serious 

444.44 450.90 A: yeah but here's the thing you you go outside the city you go across the border into like jersey or pennsylvania [mn] 

449.79 450.83 B: mhm 

451.42 453.76 A: and there's a whole industry set up 

454.68 458.33 A: for cigarettes just uh so you can by pass the city taxes 

457.97 459.12 B: wow 

459.57 472.62 A: though they're supposed to be cracking down on that and making it a uniform price in most of the northeast i think they're having a little problem with the other states because it would interfere with you know like pennsylvania compared to new york is uh 

467.83 468.75 B: yeah 

473.55 476.32 A: maybe a fifth of the size in population 

475.95 476.95 B: mhm 

476.55 484.17 A: so if you've set up a whole cottage industry and it's not cottages but an industry that's selling cigarettes to new yorkers 

485.55 493.50 A: telling them they're out of busi- you know pushing their price up to the same as new york nobody's going to go across the border to pennsylvania to get cigarettes and they're out of business 

493.01 494.42 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

495.34 500.31 B: wow 'cause i know they raised the taxes over here on smoking but boy not that much yet 

499.46 501.68 A: how much how much is a pack down there 

501.48 502.37 B: um 

502.79 507.48 B: uh average price is anywhere between three to four dollars a pack 

507.31 511.40 A: that's about pennsylvania pennsylvania may be a little higher but somewhere in that 

510.80 514.85 B: yeah oh wow seven dollars a pack i'd go broke 

511.41 513.12 A: three eighty is the 

514.51 517.08 A: mm how many packs do you smoke a day 

517.51 523.93 B: um well i've been cutting back 'cause i'm going to try and quit here in a little bit but [laughter] hopefully i like those 

523.90 532.59 B: but um at this point i probably only smoke about um depending on how stressful day is anywhere from half a pack to a pack 

531.89 532.69 A: mhm 

532.81 535.29 A: i run probably closer to the pack 

535.33 539.92 A: but uh my days are usually long and so so i live on coffee and cigarettes 

540.29 541.40 B: yeah 

541.98 544.57 B: yeah that's kinda the way to go sometimes [laughter] 

544.37 546.28 A: (( yeah )) 

546.23 547.05 B: (( so )) 

546.51 547.07 A: (( [mn] )) 

547.58 548.66 A: that's a 

548.79 557.70 A: um i i think i think new york has even more stringent regulations on smoking now than california 

557.07 558.21 B: really 

557.82 559.95 A: mhm 

559.17 561.97 B: boy and i thought they were just the mean ones [noise] 

562.27 573.70 A: no i always get the feeling that is one upmanship between the two and it doesn't matter whether the one upmanship is a bettering of the place or worse- worsening 

571.76 572.81 B: mhm 

573.45 574.94 B: yeah i notice uh 

575.21 578.88 B: they always do seem to kind of almost be in competition or something 

578.43 580.55 A: mhm 

579.41 580.54 B: yeah 

580.65 585.94 B: what do you think of the uh the the smoke ads they put out there to get people to quit smoking 

586.57 599.95 A: um that's okay there's nothing wrong with that uh uh personally it's a thing i enjoy partially and i've done it for so long i i i find nothing would be wrong with people quitting i think it's a good thing to do 

598.18 599.13 B: yeah
