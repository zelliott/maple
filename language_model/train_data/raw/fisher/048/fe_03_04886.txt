28.80 30.64 B: uh i guess so 

31.04 32.16 A: um 

32.83 37.20 A: so you think all of them should be televised kinda like the o. j. simpson

38.53 39.66 B: (( [noise] [sigh] well )) 

40.70 43.73 B: it got it got a little t- bit much after a while 

43.53 44.49 A: uh-huh 

44.05 48.60 B: but some of them i think we should be able to see what's going on behind closed doors 

47.87 52.35 A: ah i i agree with with some of that um w- 

50.68 53.47 B: mhm but too much of it would be ah 

53.91 56.74 B: you know an occasional here and there to see what the ah 

56.86 57.69 B: (( you know )) 

57.93 60.08 B: what what they're doing but [noise] [noise] 

59.89 67.44 A: well with this new t._v. network court t._v. i've i've seen it a couple of times in fact i was watching it yesterday while i was lunch 

66.91 67.74 B: uh-huh 

67.64 68.85 A: (( i ah )) 

69.42 73.25 A: there was somebody on there that it was showing the 

73.39 78.34 A: ah indictment hearing i think it was for someone who 

75.56 76.66 B: (( mhm )) 

78.61 81.28 A: um i think it's that petersen guy 

81.81 84.91 A: i don't know exactly i don't know that for sure 

84.52 85.64 B: mhm 

85.04 89.38 A: but it seemed like he had um 

90.23 90.79 A: (( [sigh] )) 

91.72 95.07 B: i don't even know which what what ah case that is 

94.76 103.11 A: the petersen guy well i know what this case was about again i don't know the name but the guy was um 

100.33 101.15 B: (( mhm )) 

103.76 106.98 A: being indicted for manslaughter 

106.68 107.54 B: uh-huh 

107.10 111.18 A: because he had helped his wife 

111.53 113.63 A: commit suicide who was pregnant 

112.66 122.34 B: oh oh oh oh ah [noise] yeah like i say some of the cases i mean it's kinda fascinating but i wouldn't i wouldn't want to have it on like all the time 

121.97 123.20 A: yeah 

122.62 124.16 B: but um 

123.79 132.66 A: i think there's so ah a a channel like that would be good where if you wanted to watch it you could but you don't didn't have to necessarily do it and they 

131.15 137.70 B: yeah i mean it that o. j. simpson thing was a bit much i mean that was that was that was [sigh] 

134.85 135.83 A: oh yeah 

136.54 139.85 A: that's like didn't like all the network 

139.86 144.45 A: ah or at least one of the networks show it pretty much constantly 

143.83 155.37 B: yeah i mean they it it got a but much but i mean i mean that it it's kinda interesting to watch but i mean i usually i personally have a hard time with the whole [laughter] court system 

155.05 156.13 A: [laughter] 

155.41 160.65 B: the whole judicial system i mean i think it's it's ludicrous most of the time 

160.32 168.08 A: i think that it'd probably be good for some of the supreme court well mo- all of the supreme court ah 

166.53 167.34 B: (( mhm )) 

169.08 172.43 A: trials to be on t._v. for 

172.47 175.12 A: for people to watch if they so choose 

174.75 182.98 B: right yeah i mean they could be available but it's you know it's not that i'm against it but i wouldn't want to see it like on all my major channels like all the time 

181.79 185.19 A: oh no no it would definitely have to be a separate channel 

184.52 195.52 B: yeah you know like if i wanted the option you know with the o. j. simpson thing i think it was on like all the channels all the time and it got it got like enough is enough if i wanna watch it fine but like to stick in your face [noise] 

189.88 190.73 A: yes 

195.51 198.91 A: yeah now in cases like the ah 

196.08 196.90 B: but 

200.43 201.93 A: (( the ah )) 

202.73 207.64 A: going back to the september eleventh stuff and the people that are still held at guantanamo bay 

207.62 208.83 B: right right 

208.06 216.06 A: um i understand that there are some security issues there and i don't have a problem with that being held behind closed doors 

212.91 213.81 B: (( mhm )) 

215.17 229.18 B: mhm well actually i what i think i think all politics should go on and be video taped [laughter] like all things that are going on like for example when [laughter] i mean like i say i have hard i i wouldn't one of my big 

221.05 222.89 A: yes yes um 

229.38 243.68 B: buttons is is the whole judicial system because it's all about paying off people it has really nothing to do with with most of the times doesn't even have to do with real justice [laughter] you know i mean the way everything's run run by a few powerful white men and that's it [noise] 

237.95 239.57 A: right right 

243.04 245.52 A: yeah and with the 

245.50 258.66 A: like the enron thing i think some of the big court ah cases should be shown but again on on their own channel um kinda like cspan i think ah 

253.58 254.41 B: (( mhm )) 

255.50 256.69 B: right right 

258.34 259.93 B: right yeah 

259.00 264.05 A: cspan shows ah like stuff going on at um 

264.14 270.41 A: the house of representatives and and the senate and that stuff that some people wanna watch and some people don't 

269.97 271.18 B: right right 

270.64 274.10 A: so a a channel like that i think would be good 

273.39 281.22 B: yeah i think that's that's that's an idea and if people wanna watch but i would like is a channel which you call in to change a lot of [laughter] the things 

281.07 289.16 B: i'm looking for the thing to change so many of these laws and and these things that exist now i mean i you'll where do you live 

288.58 290.62 A: i live in ah louisiana 

290.10 291.38 B: oh okay 

290.92 292.51 A: north louisiana 

291.97 300.25 B: so i mean here in new york i mean it's just getting so out of hand i mean i don't know if you read the story [laughter] about the guy who got a ticket for sitting on a ah crate outside 

300.36 308.13 B: i mean it's just ludicrous things that make absolutely no sense it's just that they're trying to get a lot of money now because they're crying that that the city's in debt 

307.56 308.63 A: oh okay 

308.20 312.16 B: but what i would like to have on t._v. is to have exposed 

312.03 325.65 B: all these c._e._o.s and all these city workers that make up their own um [lipsmack] salaries and to show that on t._v. like how much are the all these people making because what they're doing is they're firing people left and right 

318.11 319.11 A: yes 

325.47 331.95 B: and then a few people who are in the top position are just giving themselves whatever salary they damn well please [laughter] 

331.07 346.04 A: yeah that goes back to the ah was it american airlines or united airlines um where the union workers were giving in all these concessions and then it came out that a few of the of the top people were getting paid bonuses to stay yeah 

343.63 344.40 B: (( oh yeah )) 

345.37 354.53 B: yeah yeah yeah i mean that's the kinda stuff that see i i'd i wish there was a channel like i say i could watch that says this is what you need to do to stop this 

346.12 347.06 A: yeah 

354.50 367.89 B: um i was telling all these other people that i'm ready to have my one million really pissed off people march because the [laughter] taking they are so taking advantage of everybody i mean here our mayor in the city is closing firehouses how dare he 

355.45 356.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

359.67 361.57 A: [laughter] 

367.48 370.20 A: huh i hadn't heard anything like that 

369.54 374.87 B: oh yeah they cl- they're trying to close six firehouses because of this so called ah 

374.81 381.91 B: deficit but like i'm saying all he has to do is fire a couple of people that are probably working for him at probably like a million dollars a minute 

375.94 376.81 A: yeah 

381.83 391.29 B: and that would stop this thing right there and then we had the whole thing with the subway which was exposed that they had two sets of books and they were crying because it showed that there was a um 

391.59 400.69 B: there was more money than needed then what happens all of a sudden they're saying we have a deficit we have to raise the fares so they raised the fare fifty cents 

400.27 401.49 A: golly 

400.88 407.70 B: and it was shown and i even saw part of the i went to the ah to the courtroom to see part of the ah actual hearing 

407.38 408.37 A: (( mhm )) 

407.79 413.86 B: and the m._t._a. which um the the lawyer for the people which is me i'm the people 

413.46 414.40 A: right 

413.76 427.78 B: we had one and they were supposed to roll back the fares but then what happens is because see you're dealing with politics and everyone's paid off and this is how the world runs it's not run on ah really the power of the people it's run on the power of a few 

427.47 428.35 A: uh-huh 

427.77 433.33 B: um put it on hold the m._t._a. appealed it so their their lawyer their judge 

432.88 437.08 A: so they're still getting fifty cents a head for everybody stepping on the thing 

434.86 435.74 B: yep 

435.79 439.11 B: two dollars a ride 

438.37 443.81 A: and and and you're going to get a refund for all that extra money that you're spending right 

443.08 444.76 B: nope 

443.85 445.32 A: [laughter] 

445.37 454.72 B: no what we're getting is more aggravation and more stress and actually we should we should get a r- refund we should get a refund for all the stress that for half the times the trains are [laughter] 

454.85 455.69 A: huh 

455.13 458.23 B: well you see that i'd like to go on t._v. i'd like to um 

458.73 473.48 B: they should have the people be able to go on t._v. and air air air their ah thoughts without getting arrested because then you're probably put on like a list if you say anything um negative they probably like you know have your house ransacked they probably you know 

466.82 467.66 A: right 

473.63 482.39 B: tap your phones i mean they say that we have all the freedom we want but you know what there's a limit on how much freedom we could speak out without something like happening 

474.85 475.80 A: yeah 

482.03 484.76 A: yeah with this patriot act thing ah 

483.77 484.65 B: yeah 

485.68 493.49 B: yeah i think it's just all out of hand and the whole court system's out of hand and everything's out of hand and i my personal feeling is that people should take their power back 

493.44 502.40 B: you know and then like you know when you have these lawyers th- that that will get anybody like i have a really hard time with lawyers who will know someone's a murderer and a rapist and will defend them 

502.14 503.08 A: yeah 

502.49 506.37 B: i mean to me personally th- they'd sell their own mother's soul 

506.53 509.51 B: and that that just infuriates me 

509.02 511.06 A: well in in ah 

511.34 514.60 A: a little bit of a defence of the lawyers um 

514.75 524.24 A: as a lawyer don't you have to spend a certain amount of time as a public defender or a certain number of cases a year as a public defender 

524.30 535.65 A: and one of the things in the in the lawyer's oath i don't know exactly what it's called um is that you have to do your best for your client regardless 

535.63 538.15 B: yeah but see my point is 

537.96 539.08 A: (( and that )) 

538.32 550.89 B: i mean i don't know if you have any kids or any daughters but if you came home and found your daughter like decapitated and had been raped and then your you know and then your lawyer and and you know like the guy did it [laughter] you know what i mean i think you might have a different 

550.56 557.46 A: oh yeah i i i i fully agree with that but ah what should the lawyers do differently 

551.47 552.68 B: you know what i mean 

553.32 554.54 B: [laughter] you know 

554.69 556.05 B: i don't think 

556.76 562.43 B: well what they should do is then you do [laughter] you don't you don't take a case like that waste people's time and money 

562.05 566.12 A: well but but they're forced to in order to keep their 

566.22 568.48 A: um licenses 

566.93 567.80 B: well my 

568.09 579.50 B: well my feeling is then they shouldn't then they shouldn't even have somebody in that position i mean it's so unethical and it's so unconscious um and i don't that should exist that you have a a per- i mean 

568.84 569.99 A: (( to do that )) 

572.10 573.04 A: right 

573.67 574.46 A: right 

574.72 575.83 A: right 

579.28 591.00 B: and the other thing which is ludicrous is that you can be a criminal and then you can be your own lawyer and then you can interrogate the people that you've like huh violated now what kinda what is this 

582.77 583.73 A: mhm 

588.39 589.91 A: [laughter] 

590.32 592.58 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

591.43 598.46 B: you see i don't understand i don't my feelings i just don't understand how this is able to exist 

598.39 599.34 A: huh 

599.05 599.89 B: this is my
