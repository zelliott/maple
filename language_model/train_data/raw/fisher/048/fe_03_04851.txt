0.65 2.33 A: hi i'm alfred 

2.04 3.94 B: [noise] hi alfred i'm joe 

3.72 5.13 A: hi joe how are ya 

4.75 6.07 B: i'm good how are you 

5.94 7.40 A: oh i'm fine thanks 

7.20 8.99 B: so where are you calling from 

8.40 10.93 A: uh i'm calling from philadelphia 

10.02 11.78 B: hey me too [laughter] 

10.95 14.37 A: oh [laughter] good um 

13.05 15.64 B: last time i talked to a girl from miami 

15.41 16.77 A: oh really 

16.03 17.98 B: yep 

16.78 21.98 A: ah [lipsmack] uh so uh so panic what do ya think 

21.49 24.97 B: i think most people would panic during a terrorist attack 

24.58 26.06 A: oh really 

25.21 30.25 B: oh yeah i think the general population wouldn't have any idea what to do 

30.10 30.92 A: uh-huh 

30.80 35.32 B: you know i don't think i would have much of an idea what to do but i'd like to think i'd remain calm yep 

34.91 36.48 A: right right 

36.54 39.76 A: um so let's see i mean 

40.31 44.09 A: i i i think i tend to agree with you uh panic 

45.11 48.88 A: panic definitely seems to be a first instinct uh-huh right 

48.09 58.22 B: yeah definitely and i think i think i would panic at first but it's just a matter of being able to calm myself down and think rationally in a high pressure situation 

58.33 70.81 B: and just from my experience with you know the general population a lot of people don't know how to do that you know like there's a long line to bank and people are freaking out [laughter] you know i mean they're panicking there and 

63.86 65.64 A: yeah 

68.82 71.79 A: [laughter] 

71.35 75.90 B: you know it's it's just something that's out of your control and it's just a matter of how you would handle yourself 

75.60 81.92 A: yeah [mn] you know i think the i think i think another important part is uh 

81.98 89.44 A: you know your distance from the incident so let's say there's a you know if obviously if you're close to the terrorist incident 

85.20 86.73 B: yeah yeah 

89.33 98.72 A: the level of panic that you're gonna have um is going to be higher and far more understandable and as you get further away your response becomes more rational and uh 

97.86 101.95 B: yeah that that definitely has something to do with it you're definitely right on there 

100.29 102.00 A: (( yeah )) 

102.01 114.82 A: so um i mean so let's say how far how far away from an incident would you have to be do you think for you to be rational i mean you you you mentioned that you would hope that you would keep you know keep your wits about you 

114.13 115.43 B: (( if yeah )) 

114.78 119.59 A: at the uh at the at the scene let's say let's say at ground zero right 

118.49 131.46 B: yeah ground zero that's see that would be tough 'cause that's just chaos you know anything goes at that point so you're pretty much i think people are relying on your natural instincts as a as an animal just to survive 

123.57 125.45 A: right 

131.84 135.32 B: and i don't think being calm really plays into that you know 

135.21 136.60 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

135.60 143.06 B: but i'd like to think that maybe like a a fire in a movie theater or some sort of situation like that i would remain calm 

142.97 144.82 A: right 

143.39 147.57 B: but you know a terrorist isn't really going to set fire to a movie theater you know [laughter] 

146.90 149.21 A: well you know that happened in russia 

149.18 151.08 B: did it really 

150.02 154.13 A: yeah they well i mean they didn't set fire to it but they certainly took over the theater 

154.48 156.16 B: oh yeah i remember that 

155.55 158.88 A: yeah that was that was that was an extremely scary thing 

158.30 159.33 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

159.06 164.95 A: um where they they set the gas i believe no that was rescue attempt [laughter] 

165.30 170.24 A: where where they came in with the gas and and and killed a whole bunch of people but 

166.95 167.82 B: yeah 

168.92 170.67 B: see i would i'm sorry go 

170.73 175.84 A: no i i well i only i don't know if the situations are exactly comparable or not but 

174.18 179.02 B: ahead well i think in a situation like a hostage situation i would definitely remain calm 

178.84 180.62 A: mhm 

179.26 190.95 B: yeah i mean on the inside i'd be terrified but i wouldn't you know i wouldn't freak out just only have to give 'em like they're not given the the satisfaction you know what i mean i'd be 

189.45 191.18 A: right 

190.81 195.14 B: calm and cooperative but i don't know if i'd be 

194.16 199.89 A: phew i don't know if i'd be able to keep the cool head that you seem to have [laughter] 

197.34 201.93 B: [laughter] i'm a pretty laid back person so 

201.99 206.33 B: you know what i mean obviously it wouldn't be something i'm looking forward to but 

206.41 214.56 A: well i think that incident in russia is is is pretty interesting because i mean let's say you're in the hostage situation for 

214.48 224.38 A: you know let's say twenty four hours and by the by the you know by the by the fifth hour let's say you are you are in a frenzied state and 

218.74 219.78 B: yeah you 

220.71 224.86 B: yeah you've definitely pretty much had enough at that point 

224.52 228.89 A: yeah and the people who run right and what the threat i think 

228.82 234.90 A: to keep people from running was that well we'll not only will will we shoot you let's say but we'll blow up everyone else 

234.21 235.83 B: yeah 

234.77 249.77 A: i mean do you think that you could let's say if you try and run knowing that you could cause not only you know your own death but the death uh of many others there i mean that's that's that deal could be very powerful i think 

248.70 250.84 B: that alone would make me not run 

250.54 251.29 A: (( nah )) 

250.91 255.94 B: knowing that you know let's say there was ten of us and if i escape the other nine die i wouldn't go 

255.79 257.57 A: mhm 

256.14 265.49 B: just you know i like to think of myself as a good person and i would also like to hope that the other nine people would think the same thing you know [laughter] for my benefit but 

262.91 264.06 A: (( [laughter] right [noise] )) 

264.69 265.36 A: (( uh-huh )) 

265.80 274.45 B: [sigh] uh that would definitely persuade me not to just the fact that i my you know actions would be harming these other people that 

274.60 278.41 B: you know i have [noise] you know maybe i've never even met them before you know 

278.27 279.08 A: uh-huh 

278.73 289.55 B: i couldn't do that so just from that i would probably try and keep calm but i'm not you know i think there's a lot of high strung people [laughter] you know that wouldn't 

287.15 290.32 A: [laughter] 

289.75 292.62 B: that wouldn't f- follow that path you know 

292.76 300.13 A: so so let me get a little uh controversial with you um do you think do you think uh women would be more high strung or do you think men would be 

301.56 307.01 B: i think um i guess overall women would be i would 

307.08 309.50 B: (( think but )) 

307.21 308.00 A: uh-huh 

309.57 315.06 B: [lipsmack] i don't know there are some pretty high strung men as well who don't seem to [laughter] 

312.79 314.82 A: [laughter] 

315.24 317.92 B: to know what to do in situations like 

318.09 318.90 A: uh-huh 

318.37 324.42 B: that i don't know like i i work with in my job i deal with people every day 

319.57 320.15 A: (( [mn] )) 

324.13 325.41 A: uh-huh what do you do 

325.59 328.68 B: i work at a dealership i sell cars 

328.08 329.83 A: mhm 

328.63 341.08 B: so i mean maybe it has to do with people spending their money but they're usually not very happy people as an overall and they seem to be very high strung and very very stressed out and i think adding 

331.80 333.51 A: mhm 

339.75 342.50 A: well buying a car is a pretty stressful thing 

341.86 344.78 B: yeah [laughter] definitely but 

342.63 343.43 A: [laughter] 

343.79 348.91 A: especially with the salesmen coming in right i mean i i have never bought a car but that's what i imagine 

346.40 347.31 B: yeah 

348.89 352.82 B: well it's definitely not a great experience i don't even like like cars 

349.01 350.14 A: (( to be the case )) 

350.97 354.95 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

352.86 353.68 B: (( you know )) 

353.73 359.01 B: [laughter] but it's just that people don't i don't know i don't know what i'm trying to say here 

358.67 361.71 A: mhm well let me ask you another question 

361.26 362.14 B: okay 

362.11 368.56 A: um i mean i remember during uh [lipsmack] you know after after nine eleven and what not and you see the uh 

369.08 376.97 A: the videotape of people's reactions to the planes hitting the building right um and i remember reading an article at the time 

373.32 374.48 B: yeah 

376.74 385.92 A: where everyone who was white looked up at the building and stared in amazement you know but everyone who was black was uh running you know 

381.67 383.33 B: yeah 

385.16 386.58 B: yeah 

385.97 390.64 A: from the situation i mean do you think that you could break down panic along racial lines 

390.28 391.76 B: yeah definitely 

391.30 392.27 A: really 

392.00 397.78 B: i think so i think because the way people seem to feel that we are i 

392.96 394.64 A: mhm 

398.63 411.09 B: don't know i can't think of the word i'm looking for but kinda like that they they're amazed that that could happen to us like we're untouchable you know whereas like obviously minorities have had a much harder 

405.07 406.81 A: mhm 

410.97 416.23 B: road just through social structure to achieve what they've achieved and they're 

416.57 422.16 B: not maybe individuals are used to it but their culture is used to horrible things happening to 'em you know 

421.97 423.27 A: right 

422.32 428.01 B: i don't know if you saw the article in the newspaper the other day i think it was last week but the indians the 

428.69 436.46 B: claimed to land in easton and they want to put a casino in philadelphia to make up for that land 

435.85 436.69 A: uh-huh 

436.39 447.72 B: and i talked to people at work and they're outraged they're like you know who are these indians to claim land and it's kinda like well they were kinda here before we got here and we just moved 'em away you know 

441.96 443.88 A: [laughter] 

446.90 448.06 A: right 

448.40 452.28 B: so i think that you know the way people 

451.08 455.56 A: oh i mean the government yeah the government has done horribly with uh with indians 

455.58 466.76 B: [lipsmack] but but at the time at the time though the government was white people you know there weren't there weren't any you know jesse jackson wasn't around in the seventeen hundreds you know or 

455.99 457.66 A: with native americans 

460.01 461.11 A: right 

466.67 479.95 B: reverend al sharpton they weren't trying to integrate the government like they are now and i think that the minorities would definitely they'd see that that would be something horrible and i don't know 

479.88 482.87 B: i just think that their cultures are more 

483.53 486.02 B: used to horrible things you 

485.44 490.59 A: mm and that that um would encourage a more panicked response or 

489.74 495.81 B: know i think so yeah whereas white people would kinda be like oh my i can't believe this is happening to us [noise] 

495.65 508.74 A: ah this is this is i think this is a pretty interesting opinion you're uh you're putting forward let me now now let me ask you uh do you think now what what do you mean by minorities here blacks hispanics um asians um 

510.12 512.03 B: yeah like yeah 

511.41 512.65 A: all all three 

512.55 514.10 B: (( yes i suppose so )) 

513.13 518.69 A: okay why i'm asking is 'cause i'm asian myself and so uh you know how often at times 

515.03 515.91 B: okay 

517.49 521.20 B: well asians haven't really been treated very well in this country either 

521.05 521.85 A: (( [mn] i )) 

522.17 524.01 B: i mean more so this 

522.24 524.18 A: mean i i mean it depends 

524.10 527.49 B: if you think about in the beginning parts of this century 

527.49 529.20 A: mhm 

527.50 533.64 B: a lot of the asians that lived in the inner cities of new york and philadelphia in big cities like that 

533.11 533.92 A: uh-huh 

533.65 546.88 B: weren't really treated very well you know what i mean i'm of irish descent and the neighborhood i used to live in in the center city or in south philadelphia is now mostly black and asian because 

535.28 536.65 A: (( well yeah that's true )) 

546.25 547.84 A: uh-huh really 

547.49 550.90 B: yeah as we were able to move outta the ghetto 

548.34 549.46 A: [laughter] 

550.57 554.32 A: i guess around washington like say if you're not in washington or 

553.72 554.90 B: yeah 

554.55 557.59 A: (( i mean you know like that's pretty heavily vietnamese maybe )) 

557.43 559.04 B: but 

559.59 570.59 B: i don't know i just like i'm i'm no no problem um i'm a white guy myself and i don't really feel very good about my record with with [laughter] people in our past you know 

559.72 560.55 A: (( i don't know )) 

561.19 562.58 A: i'm sorry to interrupt 

570.44 571.25 A: uh-huh 

571.65 572.86 B: like i definitely 

571.89 577.25 A: well i i mean nothing you know uh individual guilt i mean you can't do very much about that i 

576.92 580.59 B: well you i mean there's not much i can do i can change my attitude though 

579.50 582.19 A: (( think right )) 

580.78 592.07 B: you know and i can try and into other people's ideas that don't even wouldn't even consider it like the guy's exact words to me about the indians were do you believe what these indians are doing 

592.43 597.40 B: you know and i looked at him seriously and i said yeah it's always take take take with them 

594.71 599.89 A: (( [laughter] )) 

597.41 599.89 B: (( you know [laughter] and he ))
