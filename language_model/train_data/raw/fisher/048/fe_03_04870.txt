35.65 38.20 A: then i probably 

38.76 41.87 A: will sort of be forced to but i don't think it will be 

40.49 49.04 B: [laughter] i don't think it's going to be quite as prominent but they've got some high powered lawyers and i have a feeling that we're gonna see more than we want to maybe 

48.70 53.64 A: yeah um i don't know a- as far as um 

50.20 50.90 B: (( but )) 

54.29 58.76 A: [lipsmack] the court cases being on television i really don't have a problem with that 

59.02 60.90 A: i mean it's interesting 

60.44 61.60 B: right 

61.22 62.29 A: but um

141.79 143.56 A: when they did um 

143.61 152.53 A: like the o. j. mock trials those were interesting they have like you know like famous lawyers get on there like pretending that they would be 

146.89 148.17 B: mhm 

152.58 153.75 B: right 

153.20 160.97 A: um defending and what not that was interesting and i do remember watching like a mock trial thing of um 

161.47 167.73 A: [lipsmack] ah this was about i don't know maybe five six years ago they had this whole big mock trial of um 

167.77 169.23 A: [lipsmack] the um

175.72 176.70 A: yeah 

177.73 184.19 A: [laughter] yeah well yeah the actual trial yeah but but but it this was like a mock trial just a few years back

183.68 184.91 B: oh really 

184.27 188.46 A: yeah what if you know what if it happened today some sort of thing and 

187.95 188.86 B: hm 

188.58 189.95 A: they had a um 

190.03 195.51 A: [lipsmack] tele famous lawyers trying the case and ah the defense actually won [laughter] 

195.24 196.41 B: wow 

195.82 196.97 A: yeah 

196.76 203.46 B: well i g- i guess i missed that one but some of it's interesting some of it's kinda boring to me you know 

198.78 199.46 A: [mn] 

203.82 206.85 B: and i i watch like i said just a little bit of it 

206.94 208.99 B: what else did she say we're supposed to cover 

209.81 212.16 A: [laughter] i think that was it 

211.42 215.52 B: [laughter] something about do we think it should be on t._v. or 

215.14 219.08 A: yeah do we th- do we do we think that 

219.12 222.00 A: that high profile 

223.62 225.78 A: criminal cases 

225.56 227.57 B: should be televised probably 

226.37 229.24 A: should be should be televised 

228.69 233.28 B: well i have a feeling that we're gonna see more than we want to of the scott peterson case 

233.03 234.33 A: yeah 

233.84 237.41 B: because that's been such high profile as it is right now 

236.51 239.84 A: yeah well oh what about um [lipsmack] 

241.44 245.25 A: oh um what's his face is that on t._v. ah baretta 

245.75 255.20 B: you know that was on that used to be on court t._v. a lot and i like i said i didn't watch it during the day but it would be on every day that he was in court that baretta guy 

254.99 255.91 A: yeah 

255.34 256.58 B: and um 

256.99 260.38 B: but now he's out on bond so you don't hear much about him right now

275.35 282.99 A: yeah um yeah i would've been interested in the to follow that a little bit but i guess i didn't get really get a chance to 

276.05 276.98 B: (( i d- i don't )) 

282.91 284.64 B: well it it's it 

283.90 287.34 A: i know it was like he was accused of having his wife murdered 

286.70 289.80 B: having her murdered yes exactly [laughter] 

287.88 288.97 A: yeah 

289.65 290.74 A: yeah 

290.20 300.59 B: um and they went through you know and i guess that i saw a little bit of it um i've recently quit work so i am home a little bit more so i see a little bit more than i maybe did before 

300.33 301.26 A: uh-huh 

300.84 304.21 B: but i i saw a small amount of that 

304.35 306.95 B: and he looked like he had aged 

307.47 310.94 B: fifty years [laughter] from the time he went into 

311.11 315.63 B: to jail 'til they let him out i mean he just looked really bad [laughter] 

315.04 316.33 A: oh really 

315.81 323.81 B: oh my goodness he was just totally his hair was totally white and he r- looked like he really aged badly [laughter] 

323.61 325.65 A: well he's an old guy though right 

324.96 327.05 B: i did i don't think he's too young 

327.20 328.14 A: yeah 

327.58 332.05 B: i really don't so he probably you know is right up there in ages 

332.68 333.38 B: so 

333.72 334.51 A: yeah 

334.37 338.51 B: but well this is interesting talking about this kind of stuff [laughter] 

337.25 342.14 A: [laughter] i yeah i'd i'd i'm i w- i w- i wish i could be um 

342.88 347.43 A: [lipsmack] you know more help but it's not something that i really think much about [laughter] 

346.76 347.74 B: well 

348.29 361.43 B: neither do i really you know like i said it's um ah there're a lot of people though that are just totally wrapped up into these court t._v. shows and they watch them all but i've seen you know just sketches of 'em so 

349.56 350.46 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

361.90 363.31 B: that's about it 

363.75 371.36 A: well ah yeah i'd i'd 'cause i'm kinda stuck watching my soap operas from two to four so [laughter] 

368.57 370.23 B: [laughter] 

370.31 373.23 B: [laughter] i'm not into those [laughter] 

372.19 379.31 A: i've i've seen some court on the soap operas [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] yeah um 

374.81 377.98 B: [laughter] i'm sure you have [laughter] i'm sure you have 

379.65 383.14 A: but um yeah i don't i don't know i s- jeeze 

384.18 386.54 B: do you feel that they should be televised 

389.00 391.21 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] i think it depends on the case 

391.88 393.16 A: i mean 

394.91 396.04 A: [lipsmack] i don't 

396.86 401.42 A: i think i think that just about anything can be televised i mean 

402.05 414.43 A: they have all those they have all the channels i mean i d- they shouldn't m- you know i don't think that they i definitely don't think that they should be nationally televi- like um [lipsmack] you know televised 

405.08 405.99 B: mhm 

414.85 418.23 A: you know they shouldn't they shouldn't preempt anything for them 

417.69 423.05 B: so you don't think they should be on like the national channels that they should be on something like court t._v. 

422.22 426.79 A: on something like court t._v. that's it yeah yes yeah they have their venue 

426.59 427.60 B: okay 

426.89 429.94 A: you know then then that's that's what that's for 

429.96 438.91 A: you know i i i definitely don't think that something that's being shown on court t._v. should should cut in to like regularly scheduled programing 

430.01 430.92 B: okay 

438.99 440.63 B: i gue- yeah 

439.01 449.10 A: but i mean i think you know i i don't think much should you know besides like you know a major presidential speech or something i mean 

449.31 453.42 A: you know i guess the major sporting events they're obviously gonna cut in 

453.24 454.49 B: (( mhm so )) 

453.87 454.93 A: but um 

455.63 466.50 A: but i i always have a problem with that like even you know even like you know the war and the other the the gulf war as well it's like all that's very interesting 

466.45 471.64 A: but we already have several news channels that are showing it non stop so i 

470.36 474.31 B: you don't want see it on like a._b._c. n._b._c. and c._b._s. and like them 

472.61 478.78 A: i don't see i don't see any reason why it should be i mean all the all of these networks have their affiliate 

475.13 476.12 B: (( okay r- )) 

478.88 485.94 A: news channels [laughter] so why not just show it there and i don't have any problem with them running 

480.98 482.52 B: (( r- n- right )) 

486.64 497.57 A: you know captions underneath the screen like you know like recent events something's going on you know like this happened for more information tune into 

489.91 490.95 B: right 

492.18 493.14 B: mhm 

497.79 506.69 A: this network you know this channel you know i don't have any problem with that but i don't see any reason why they should preempt all the regularly scheduled programing not even 

499.94 500.88 B: well 

501.42 502.33 B: right 

506.77 512.79 A: r- regardless of whether or not i'm interested in watching that regular scheduled programing it doesn't matter 

512.40 521.09 B: well i think i i guess i tend to agree with you because not everyone wants to sit and watch what they're preempting it for 

519.09 520.16 A: yeah just 

520.61 526.01 A: yeah exactly be stuck with stuff that maybe they don't wanna see maybe they're not 

525.66 526.95 B: mhm 

526.27 531.12 A: maybe you know obviously you could always shut the t._v. off and do something else but i mean 

531.41 544.26 A: you know say you have a show that you like to watch and they cut into it and you're never gonna get that show back [laughter] you know it's not like they're gonna replay it next week you're just gonna miss that you know they're not gonna play that episode ever you know 

536.99 538.12 B: yeah 

540.57 541.98 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

543.92 549.14 B: well and and with all the cable channels they no longer need to do that so you know 

547.69 555.47 A: exactly if if if it's not necessary you know then then then then why then why bother you know 

550.95 551.94 B: mhm 

555.09 556.08 B: mhm 

555.79 556.97 A: and um 

557.10 561.03 A: [lipsmack] i don't know i mean i guess some people don't have cable 

561.45 563.67 A: (( but you know )) 

562.54 565.25 B: i would bet there's not very many any more [laughter] 

564.65 573.73 A: exactly exactly i don't know anybody who doesn't have you know basic cable everyone has basic cable it seems like if you have a t._v. you can get it through your v._c._r. 

568.90 569.74 B: yeah 

573.46 575.93 B: exactly yeah i think most people 

574.42 583.57 A: you know if you have a vcr [laughter] but ah you know i don't that's again i don't most people have a t._v. have a v._c._r. you know so 

576.10 577.40 B: [laughter] 

582.64 583.70 B: mhm 

583.89 596.80 A: and if they don't then they're really not gonna be they're not gonna be you know if somebody doesn't have a v._c._r. and they don't have any basic cable or anything then they're just they're somebody that doesn't even watch television and they're probably gonna pick up this information from the newspaper [laughter] you know 

592.97 593.78 B: i yeah 

596.76 599.89 A: or something like that or they just won't and they won't c- 

596.83 597.95 B: right
