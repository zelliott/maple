23.72 24.81 B: we are 

24.78 26.45 A: [laughter] 

25.14 26.30 B: [laughter] 

26.62 30.62 A: well let's see well i guess the big question 

28.92 34.67 B: well since since you're moving since you're moving to orlando i'll tell ya what they're doing in the news here on terrorism 

34.48 35.56 A: what are they 

35.57 36.69 B: they uh 

37.00 43.12 B: they periodically have you know like the downtown area they have those uh drills 

41.41 43.65 A: (( mhm )) 

43.13 47.85 B: to uh apparently to you know help in case the real thing happens 

43.82 44.38 A: (( [cough] )) 

47.58 49.25 A: oh i see 

48.45 51.79 B: but you know however you know when the real thing happens 

51.90 53.73 A: [laughter] 

52.25 54.44 B: i i don't think anybody's going to uh 

54.45 56.59 B: really be prepared for it 

56.89 60.75 A: no you really can't prepare people for it it's uh 

61.24 69.54 A: it's one of those things that usually come up with training uh they've always talked about this because i spent uh a good portion of my 

69.69 72.44 A: of my uh early years in the army 

71.86 72.97 B: oh really 

72.73 83.74 A: yeah and then i remember being in europe for in the late eighties and back then especially in britain where i was stationed there was 

84.00 86.94 A: uh a lot of terrorist activity from the i. r. a. 

87.22 88.83 A: and uh 

88.98 101.75 A: it's kinda interesting because [cough] you're never ready really ready for it but if you're educated you can at least not panic and that's always the biggest problem um i've 

102.07 109.21 A: i've actually actually i haven't been actually inside a terrorist attack but last year believe it or not 

109.32 115.62 A: i was in the philippines and a bomb exploded about uh a couple of miles away from my motel 

115.04 117.33 B: mhm oh that must've been uh real scary 

117.87 122.21 A: it was okay it was it it was scary for a little bit but 

122.47 128.96 A: it was it was interesting to see how the different people in my family reacted because we were there for a family event 

128.31 129.14 B: uh-huh 

129.22 130.62 A: and um 

130.74 137.61 A: it seemed like uh i was actually kind of i was strangely calm i guess because i was 

138.03 140.82 A: i was educated on how to take 

141.02 148.63 A: how to take uh assessment of the situation and and figure out try to make it the most uh 

149.12 155.85 A: of the how do i say it the efficient use of our time and take uh stock of the situation 

155.49 159.02 B: well see you're out of the norm 'cause you know you're trained for that 

158.58 165.18 A: [mn] right and that was kinda weird because it was i remember having to deal with my family there because 

165.24 173.11 A: they were a little bit more um they were a little bit more excited and i had that feeling of herding cats [laughter] 

171.86 172.78 B: [laughter] 

174.48 185.86 A: but yeah we had a we had a terrorist drill here in chicago we were part of the national terrorist drill that were going here and they shut down parts of the city to simulate a terrorist attack 

185.30 186.30 B: right 

186.37 189.52 A: and uh that was kinda interesting because [cough] 

189.67 194.61 A: there was uh the people who actually didn't seem to do the best were actually 

194.82 199.29 A: the not so much the police but it was the emergency medical service 

199.35 203.13 A: because our drills was about a bio terrorism attack 

203.29 210.54 A: so they seemed to be a little bit um a little bit disorganized but it was something kind of interesting to see 

210.63 213.21 B: mhm i mean i think it's a good idea to 

212.78 213.94 A: mhm 

213.51 220.10 B: have those drills but usually like here when they have 'em everybody knows when they're having them 

220.04 221.02 A: yes 

220.73 224.95 B: which you know i kinda think that well they shouldn't know when they're having them 

224.96 227.08 B: because that'll show them 

227.62 229.73 B: you know what they would do 

229.65 230.91 A: right 

230.06 236.82 B: i mean if they know exactly when they're having 'em they're prepared for it which in a terrorist attack you're not prepared for it 

233.58 234.59 A: right 

236.49 248.06 A: yeah but the thing is that we're also brand new at this entire thing because you have to learn to walk before you can run and this is such a new experience for a lotta people 

248.25 251.82 A: they have to you have to give them a chance to think about what they're going to do 

252.53 259.54 B: you know it's funny i was at the airport today i had to go pick some people up and because everything that's been happening you know the past couple of weeks 

255.90 256.71 A: uh-huh 

259.83 260.78 A: okay 

259.83 263.79 B: i was so sure that they were gonna just make us keep going you know circling 

263.78 264.91 A: right 

264.28 270.03 B: and uh they didn't i actually sat you know by the arrivals for a good 

268.91 269.89 A: wow 

270.27 272.12 B: i'd say fifteen minutes 

272.02 272.93 A: wow 

272.38 277.59 B: not one person you know there was no security there i couldn't believe it there's usually you know 

277.61 278.22 B: (( the )) 

278.29 283.27 B: past like couple of times that i've done that you know they just keep telling ya to move it 

283.05 285.96 A: right 'cause in in chicago here when 

286.18 288.73 A: uh because of the threats 

289.14 293.23 A: uh if you're at the arriv- if you're going to the arrivals or even departures 

293.20 307.28 A: if you even stop they'll get they've move you out of the way and the average tow time for somebody over here is about uh it seems like i've heard that they've towed in less than five minutes 

307.82 311.28 B: well i find that funny 'cause the tow truck was just right behind me 

311.42 313.05 A: oh that's really weird 

312.49 315.83 B: and i mean he was sitting there i guess waiting to be called 

316.11 320.33 B: but uh nobody even bothered me i couldn't believe it i was actually kind of 

316.18 316.92 A: that's 

320.42 321.57 B: mad 

321.44 322.67 A: yeah i could 

321.80 322.80 B: you know 

322.86 323.94 A: yeah 

323.11 325.21 B: [laughter] i was like uh hello 

325.31 327.46 A: [laughter] yeah i think 

326.03 327.87 B: you know i could have a bomb 

328.03 340.95 A: oh wow yeah i think that the real what really needs to happen is it's gonna take some time because when i was in europe this is what they did they had a lot of public awareness and a lot of everybody took part in these drills 

340.94 347.54 A: and after a while it became [cough] i mean they did get to the point of where there were surprise drills at least locally 

347.88 356.42 A: so it's i think we just need to have some time because it's it's such a new uh it's a new threat that we've never actually thought about it 

356.02 361.71 B: do you have like your house all prepared like a place where you could go if there's a bio terrorism attack mhm 

361.08 365.33 A: no i don't and i i don't really think that 

365.71 371.79 A: if that's gonna be to actually make yourself safe from that you're not going to uh 

372.38 382.40 A: by doing just the the minimum stuff there because you can't seal uh a modern house i'm an engineer and i actually know how many holes [laughter] there are in my house 

382.97 384.13 A: so 

384.32 395.47 A: [cough] it's not worth it i i keep water and food there but there's just it's really at some point you just can't you're just worrying too much about something that you really can't control 

394.86 395.87 B: right 

396.02 398.29 A: have you got have you done any preparation 

397.98 402.11 B: oh yeah i have and my husband like laughed at me because like under you know 

402.53 405.31 B: the you know the cabinets i have food and 

405.40 406.26 A: right 

405.68 419.60 B: you know toiletries and and medicine and stuff like that and i even went you know when they were talking about the b- bio terrorism i cut out [laughter] you know the plastic for every single window in the house and my husband's like you just have way too much time on your hands 

413.95 415.61 A: [cough] plastic yeah 

416.08 417.17 A: right 

419.86 423.95 A: yeah well that's that's the worst part 

420.43 422.32 B: [laughter] and i said okay well 

423.51 435.82 B: yeah he he was laughing and i said you know okay well you know being in in orlando you know i said all right well this summer if there's a hurricane and i'm prepared and you're scrambling [laughter] i said you know 

432.36 433.32 A: right 

435.85 438.06 B: i said i think i'm doing right [mn] 

437.87 441.85 A: yeah well if if you're prepared then you can do the best you can 

441.95 443.10 A: um 

443.30 449.52 A: i may actually when i move out there i may actually try to see if i can seal the place up a little bit more 

449.74 455.33 A: but it's gonna be kinda hard i i remember being in the army having my training on 

455.63 462.67 A: bio weapons and chemicals gas weap- uh lectures and exercises we had there [cough] and uh i 

462.95 471.79 A: hate to say it it's really scary uh we had to be i was exposed to at the very least tear gas but then 

472.06 478.61 A: i remember all the training i had about what happens if you get uh any of the other more lethal agents 

479.32 487.56 A: and uh [lipsmack] that's pretty nasty 'cause i remember having being trained on how to administer atropine when you had 

487.58 491.65 A: uh [cough] when you had a uh nerve gas 

491.84 496.98 A: uh attack and the problem is that if you you have somewhere like a two minute window 

497.28 504.68 A: a two to five minute window depending on the agent and if you misdiagnose the your antidote could actually kill you 

504.59 505.41 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

505.56 506.54 A: so 

507.00 509.58 A: i i guess i'm a little cynical that way 

510.16 514.33 A: (( [cough] but it's definitely good to keep food around the house [laughter] )) 

513.41 514.82 B: [laughter] 

516.51 518.48 B: it's a scary time we live in 

518.51 524.51 A: yeah it is and i really think that this is gonna be 

524.80 531.60 A: everybody is other parts of the world we've been very fortunate other parts of the world have learned to live with these problems 

531.87 540.44 A: and europe has done it and i think i hate i hate to say it but some of the people who have done the best of this stuff are the israelis 'cause they always live with terrorism 

539.87 540.83 B: right 

541.17 542.76 A: (( and um )) 

542.90 546.23 A: i've i've had a bunch of friends who were 

546.40 551.20 A: who went to israel and they told me that this is nothing compared to what 

551.32 552.67 A: they're used to 

553.02 557.73 A: 'cause everybody there the government has issued everybody gas masks and everything 

556.91 560.32 B: sure and then they walk around with the weapons all the time 

558.92 559.48 A: (( [cough] )) 

560.37 573.08 A: right but i i don't know if it's really at some point when we get to that point of actually being so over prepared i think we lose the character of what makes our country what we want it to be 

572.71 573.58 B: right 

573.83 575.34 B: (( i agree with that )) 

574.08 574.96 A: so 

576.67 585.64 A: it's it's gonna be kind of weird i'm i'm [cough] scared but i like to think that uh i'm as prepared as i can be 

585.71 591.11 A: and you just have to make do with that because you can't i could die tomorrow just by getting hit by a bus 

590.61 591.66 B: right 

592.14 597.58 A: and i usually think that's a little bit more healthy attitude because if we if you live your life scared 

597.95 599.89 A: you're gonna worry about it
