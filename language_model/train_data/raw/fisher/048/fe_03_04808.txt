5.58 6.92 B: good how are you 

6.79 8.65 A: good thanks where you calling from 

8.74 9.94 B: philadelphia 

9.56 12.14 A: philadelphia okay i'm just outside i'm in uh 

13.32 14.06 B: (( mm )) 

13.96 15.07 A: (( okay so )) 

14.34 15.66 B: are you a smoker 

15.23 17.88 A: uh not really how about you 

18.04 20.69 B: [lipsmack] no uh i never have 

20.87 26.94 A: okay i've tried smoking it's not uh i'm not a prude with it i just don't do it i do have a sister who smokes 

27.27 28.47 B: you do which 

28.05 30.23 A: i i have a sister who smokes 

30.63 32.33 B: how do you feel about that 

31.71 37.90 A: well i'd wish she stop for health reasons but uh she's i don't know probably been smoking for 

38.42 41.03 A: [sigh] who knows like twenty years maybe 

41.06 47.82 A: so i don't think she'll stop and she's uh i guess from a smoker's viewpoint she's expressed that uh 

48.88 54.02 A: well she's very much against uh any kind of ban of smoking in public places 

56.80 58.67 A: uh well do you know anybody who smokes 

59.89 61.78 B: yeah um 

63.35 76.15 B: but in terms of how i feel about it i mean i'm really glad that they've done it especially in bars because in the cities that they have done it because it makes me enjoy my experience a lot more uh 

75.14 77.98 A: you don't like coming home smelling like smoke i 

77.98 84.93 B: no i mean like otherwise i go home and i have a sore throat and i get all these allergies and it's a drag so 

84.97 85.80 A: mean i'm 

85.21 85.88 B: i'm 

86.20 87.42 A: (( oh go ahead )) 

87.38 88.68 B: oh go ahead 

88.04 90.42 A: i'm sorry i thought i cut you off um 

91.19 96.30 A: i i mean i guess i uh i wouldn't mind if there were places that were designated for smoking 

98.37 99.99 B: like certain bars 

99.77 104.30 A: yeah yeah i mean then you can choose to to go there if you want to go there 

105.15 112.25 B: but uh arguments against that i guess is that people have to work there this is the argument they've used in new york 

109.68 110.50 A: yes 

112.92 117.08 B: and so they have a right to a smoke free working environment 

117.68 119.60 A: well i guess that's true too 

117.86 118.67 B: but 

120.54 124.68 B: but i guess you know they could choose to work at a different bar so 

124.29 128.14 A: i yeah i mean and i i recognize that i mean i uh 

128.79 131.85 A: i did work as a waiter for a while and i uh 

132.47 139.36 A: then there were times when i didn't really care to work in a smoking but you weren't really always in the smoking area because you were back and forth between the kitchen 

139.54 143.83 A: sometimes but i guess if you had to sit there for twelve hours and you didn't like then 

144.45 147.11 A: (( i i i guess i wouldn't want to do that either )) 

148.17 149.05 A: so 

149.95 154.35 A: we how would you feel if it happened in philadelphia you would like it 

154.06 155.33 B: i'd be happy 

156.38 159.54 A: yeah i don't know i mean that's uh 

160.31 164.49 A: i i i guess i would probably be for it more than against it 

166.76 169.41 A: only thing to for health and uh 

170.42 174.47 A: health reasons i guess that's why i i guess i don't smoke i just never really liked it 

176.66 183.65 B: but i guess what could come out of it like what could the government do next that might be like more offensive 

183.56 187.64 A: more offensive you mean like in terms of smoking prevention 

188.43 192.65 B: well like if they can prevent this maybe they'll start preventing other things 

192.34 194.67 A: oh like it might lead to something else 

194.50 195.73 B: yeah 

194.73 196.22 A: like prohibition 

196.78 202.11 B: yeah that would be terrible i think prohibition would be absolutely terrible 

202.47 205.76 A: well i i think the health argument there is the third party 

208.14 218.80 A: um have you seen those [laughter] ads in like in the daily news or philadelphia enquirer i think where they have they're trying to to link that uh smoking prevention and the and the mob 

219.51 223.20 A: like it leads to uh the high taxes um 

223.85 225.05 A: on cigarettes 

224.80 226.50 B: [noise] that's interesting 

226.00 230.84 A: which leads to black market well the ad was paid for by a uh cigarette company 

231.60 232.65 B: really 

232.03 239.64 A: so yeah it was i forget which one but they were they were trying to demonstrate that the increased taxes uh 

241.13 245.90 A: [mn] would be to uh organized crime importing and murder i don't know i 

244.94 246.35 B: [laughter] 

245.95 247.87 A: (( don't know if i buy into that either )) 

248.40 249.29 A: uh 

248.51 253.25 B: well what about they're thinking about increasing the taxes on junk food 

252.37 255.06 A: [laughter] 

255.30 258.26 A: i it wouldn't hurt be i guess [laughter] 

257.26 258.19 B: [laughter] 

259.64 260.69 A: raise a 

260.42 263.14 B: and that's not a third party argument 

263.18 264.66 A: no no 

264.70 272.73 B: so if they do that they might you know go to other substances i don't know it's scary the government has way too much power these days it's starting to 

272.93 275.44 B: to kind of make me a little nervous 

275.15 278.89 A: not a fan of of george bush or or john ashcroft 

279.22 281.25 B: oh no [laughter] 

280.18 281.67 A: [laughter] okay 

282.94 285.70 B: did you uh vote for bush 

285.33 289.14 A: i uh i i did only because i i've uh 

289.44 297.97 A: well i mean i i liked him out out of the it' hard to say out of the two he seemed like the less of two evils i mean i'd reconsider that now but 

298.91 303.09 A: (( uh it was kinda tough at the time i i don't like uh )) 

303.56 307.28 A: i i never would have imagined that he would have picked john ashcroft 

307.79 308.97 A: to uh 

309.47 312.03 A: (( be the attorney general i mean it doesn't and )) 

313.07 316.28 A: now he's kind of in charge of everything it's kinda scary 

317.20 319.56 A: didn't like that um 

320.02 321.14 A: what else 

321.49 326.81 A: [laughter] with the other cigarette thing did you did you see the study on secondhand smoke and uh 

327.29 335.66 A: it just came out yesterday or the day before that that secondhand smoke didn't really have the adverse medical affects that uh 

336.55 338.97 A: that most people thought it did it 

338.45 341.02 B: i think that's a bunk [laughter] 

339.05 343.66 A: is bunk [laughter] they said later in the article that it was like an arm of the 

343.97 348.63 A: uh philip morse company and some of the tobacco companies that had paid for the study 

349.20 354.18 A: so i mean i i guess the it's kinda hard to believe i mean there's i mean smoking's bad for 

354.19 355.45 A: (( the health of us )) 

356.14 359.27 A: i don't how whether it's secondhand or whether it's 

359.36 364.40 A: you know fresh off the cigarette i think either way it would probably be you know carcinogenic 

366.22 367.50 B: yeah 

367.58 369.35 B: that makes a lot of sense 

368.82 369.81 A: (( well )) 

370.06 371.48 A: (( i don't know )) 

371.78 373.54 A: (( i i gu- i guess )) 

373.69 377.05 A: i i think that's compelling like is what you said before 

377.39 378.54 A: the uh 

379.59 381.62 A: oh excuse me the uh 

382.38 385.81 A: people who are who don't smoke and do have to work around it 

386.88 395.62 A: but you know there are places like do you ever go in an airport and you see like there's a room where they have a special smoker's room where they have like ventilation and it's kinda aired off 

395.63 398.47 B: yeah those are good 

397.82 401.81 A: i mean i guess it's kind of expensive for every bar and restaurant to get but i mean 

402.14 406.60 A: it seems to achieve the the health care affects and the rationale behind the 

407.16 412.69 A: you know having the the ban when you could probably have establishments that have special 

412.87 415.59 A: rooms like that where you could bring your your 

415.68 420.24 A: drinks or food or whatever and have a cigarette inside out of the cold 

420.70 423.53 A: (( and then if you don't want to go in the room you don't have to go in the room i guess what do )) 

424.55 426.65 A: you think of that 

427.04 428.94 B: definitely 'cause if i was 

427.16 432.24 A: (( fair fair not fair i don't know [laughter] is it fair not fair )) 

429.67 430.55 B: hello 

432.14 434.58 B: i think it's totally fair because 

433.49 435.20 A: subject to a ban 

437.39 446.26 B: yeah because if i was a smoker i'd be very enraged if i wasn't allowed to smoke while at a restaurant because i'm there to enjoy myself and 

445.31 446.19 A: sure 

446.95 449.99 B: i wouldn't feel like i was enjoying myself if i was 

450.11 451.07 B: you know 

451.78 453.53 B: forced to like abstain 

452.84 454.88 A: and if you're addicted [laughter] 

455.51 456.76 B: yeah 

455.65 461.11 A: it is tough i've seen i mean i know through my sister and other people i know who smoke i mean after years it's uh 

461.23 471.96 A: it's just such per- such you know part of a routine and and most people i know who smoke don't wanna stop and they're kind of scared i guess they don't want to seek out 

472.03 472.93 A: uh 

472.34 473.16 B: hello 

473.09 474.65 A: hi still there 

474.45 476.98 B: yeah i'm on a cell so 

475.35 487.04 A: oh okay kind of in and out um but most people i know who smoke don't really want to stop smoking i mean they don't even if something was offered to them by way of a prevention or 

478.86 479.74 B: yeah 

487.31 491.16 A: you know classes they're just not interested in in really going 

491.25 493.77 B: do you think it's because of the weight loss 

494.78 496.57 B: that happens when you smoke 

496.14 497.10 A: um 

497.31 499.49 A: oh the weight gain when you stop 

498.88 500.17 B: yeah 

499.51 504.41 A: yeah no i i i just think they like cigarettes like like their cigarettes 

504.57 505.58 A: [laughter] 

506.02 507.63 A: (( um actually )) 

507.71 513.27 A: already pretty pretty heavy in smoke anyway they don't seem to be losing weight smoking [laughter] 

516.37 517.24 A: (( i )) 

518.94 523.25 A: i don't know does that does smoking really like help you stay thin 

524.36 533.46 B: [sigh] it's supposed to because it's something you can do with your mouth besides eat and i [laughter] i think it also raises your metabolism 

526.61 529.45 A: [laughter] okay 

533.82 534.77 A: (( okay )) 

535.42 536.60 B: but 

535.74 537.17 A: just like jogging 

538.26 540.21 B: jogging would probably be better 

539.13 540.34 A: [laughter] 

540.64 543.13 B: but if you're orally fixated 

542.46 543.46 A: sure 

543.21 545.69 B: you have to like chew gum or do something and 

545.57 546.68 A: i got ya 

547.58 548.95 A: (( take care of your )) 

547.59 548.91 B: (( yeah ))

553.03 554.60 A: what what are your favorite 

555.14 557.26 A: places uh not to smoke 

557.41 561.60 B: [laughter] um i like comedy clubs a lot 

561.01 561.75 A: (( do ya )) 

561.88 570.88 B: yeah and i love to drink like if i couldn't drink at a comedy club i wouldn't enjoy it i wouldn't go i mean nothing would be as funny 

566.61 568.51 A: [laughter] 

570.86 574.21 A: no well i i had a friend a couple of years ago who 

574.52 575.90 A: (( did comedy )) 

576.24 580.40 A: and uh god he was terrible and you would have to drink to sit and listen to him 

580.42 581.82 A: it was kind of bad 

581.87 585.51 A: but you know you're right you ever see what's that on uh 

586.25 588.49 A: comedy central when they have that 

588.51 589.52 B: yeah 

588.99 594.21 A: um oh i forget what what stand up program it's also on b._e._k. which is pretty good too
