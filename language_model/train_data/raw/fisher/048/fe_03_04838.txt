3.84 11.74 A: ah did you ever catch the ah i know that the topic of the day was terrorism but w- what specifically was the topic of the day 'cause i kind of missed that 

11.18 17.46 B: [laughter] i think it said something about how people would react to terrorism and how we would each ah act 

17.79 19.02 A: okay 

19.19 22.10 A: well ah ah i think ah how 

22.30 26.95 A: people react to terrorism's pretty clear i mean nine eleven 

27.01 32.37 A: was pretty intense and that was i mean they came together pretty well there i think 

31.99 33.83 B: oh yeah 

32.99 35.29 A: (( so ah i mean )) 

35.49 41.92 A: yeah initially i i would say there's a lot of panic but i w- wouldn't say that there's a um 

42.47 45.67 A: a whole lot of like like everybody would like 

45.73 49.31 A: you know freak out and just start rioting 

49.10 50.46 B: [laughter] 

49.52 52.17 A: course that didn't actually happen at all 

51.80 54.54 B: no that's true it didn't 

53.94 55.04 A: (( so )) 

54.65 59.87 B: but with everything going on with the war don't you think people have been very you know 

59.93 72.32 B: up front and honest of their opinion pro or con what's going on and therefore their fears of terrorism have come out in the discussions as well like on news and just in your own social environment 

71.90 81.69 A: well i mean for example like turkey okay they didn't want to give ah they they were very rigid with giving the u._s. ah 

80.73 81.95 B: permission 

81.62 92.28 A: permission and they were very right in doing so because the day after they gave permission one of their ah airplanes was hijacked i didn't really follow ah 

82.12 83.16 B: (( you're right )) 

89.94 91.16 B: right 

92.21 93.86 A: it too much to see if 

93.65 108.55 A: what the hijackers specific demands were but ah i mean it it just goes to show well yeah i mean they're right there and they held up the u._s. well then they got attacked the next day you know it's very definite 

105.81 107.00 B: mhm 

107.16 107.74 B: (( mm )) 

108.60 110.82 A: and ah i'm i 

110.96 113.25 A: mean i'm not very 

113.28 123.62 A: like worried about it if it happens well it's it's going to ah it's going to happen and ah i'm not going to be able to stop it but i am [noise] 

116.51 117.64 B: then we 

118.81 119.92 B: mhm 

123.68 126.80 A: i don't know specifically how 

126.93 133.61 A: technology is ah how exact the technology is by the u._s. government is has but ah 

133.74 138.97 A: i am very certain on a few things and it's 

139.06 143.12 A: it it's pretty mindfully how advanced the technology is 

142.51 143.54 B: true 

143.17 148.68 A: so i i'm really i don't really worry about it because 

148.30 152.51 B: well i don't know where you live or what happened but i remember after um 

153.04 161.16 B: a few things people ran out and got gas masks and a few th- people ran out and covered their windows with i don't remember what and 

161.26 163.05 A: yeah i mean 

162.14 167.92 B: and they were up in a panic but now it's like everybody just goes about their business 

167.59 171.96 A: well right now i'm in philadelphia and yeah 

169.94 173.87 B: (( are you really oh how funny i frequent phili often )) 

174.05 178.47 A: and ah i mean when nine eleven happened i was actually home in connecticut 

178.14 179.10 B: uh-huh 

178.51 180.77 A: so i mean 

180.98 192.80 A: like i was up there i was watching it and everything i actually remember the day i mean i woke up and i i was listening to the radio the radio came on and woke me up and i was listening to it it's really weird because ah 

193.15 198.18 A: i was like what the heck some- somebody went into the radio station building 

197.71 201.49 B: oh no right you were very confused yeah 

198.98 200.39 A: [laughter] 

200.87 210.51 A: yeah i was like what's going on so i went into the other room and then then i understood because my father had the television on but ah yeah i was really perplexed and then i was like 

206.81 207.88 B: uh-huh 

210.64 216.29 A: i i didn't really know what was going on but ah 'cause i was still waking up at that time and 

215.21 216.47 B: right 

216.64 217.77 A: (( ah )) 

217.67 222.51 B: my experience was quite different i start work at seven in the morning 

217.91 218.84 A: (( i don't [noise] )) 

222.32 234.28 B: and i i work in a school and they didn't want the children to panic so i didn't know anything until like probably twelve fifteen during our lunch break nothing completely oblivious to everything 

234.54 240.24 B: it was awful i was saying hello i missed all this and you know didn't announ- they're like we didn't want to announce it over the intercom 

237.48 238.47 A: (( [laughter] )) 

240.17 249.02 A: [noise] yeah i i i can understand that i mean i had to go to work well i mean like little i mean how old are the kids 

240.53 242.50 B: oh my it was awful 

243.44 244.61 B: well yeah 

248.51 250.09 B: it's a middle school 

249.91 253.61 A: a middle school yeah so they're like below thirteen years old 

253.54 259.71 B: right well no but okay yeah they're like eleven to sixteen eleven to six- 

258.78 261.05 A: eleven oh okay all right 

260.00 262.33 B: but still still you got the same 

262.39 263.36 B: idea 

262.70 273.40 A: same idea well like the sixteen year olds i could understand them ah getting the information about it but like are are you in the new york i mean obviously you're probably not in the new york area 

273.01 275.21 B: oh no way south [laughter] 

273.98 274.86 A: yeah 

275.17 284.29 A: yeah so ah i mean in in new york area i believe they actually um like evacuated the schools and everything like that but ah 

281.52 283.75 B: oh i'm sure oh yeah right 

284.74 296.41 A: yeah i mean in connecticut i was a little bit closer and ah a a lot of my ah friends 'cause i i went to a private well they weren't my friends but acquaintances from ah high school 

294.34 295.29 B: uh-huh 

296.36 300.82 A: ah were actually like personally affected because i went to a 

301.04 306.38 A: school where it drew students from across the entire state and ah 

306.42 313.30 A: some very wealthy students and their fathers actually worked in the world trader c- w- world trade center so 

311.22 312.62 B: oh yeah 

313.33 321.64 A: ah i know a couple of like stu- ah kids that i went to high school with their fathers a- ah actually 

321.66 322.51 A: died 

322.31 324.35 B: that's so unfortunate oh 

324.36 325.79 B: it really is 

325.86 332.57 B: you know we keep talking about nine eleven but i also think with the war that's going on now people have been a little more concerned about terrorism 

331.73 338.45 A: well the war's pretty much over i mean we des- pretty much destroyed them and i think we did a really good job 

333.36 334.35 B: true 

338.08 342.82 B: [laughter] yeah it took longer than expected but still it g- 

338.80 339.83 A: (( and )) 

340.52 341.29 A: like 

342.72 345.10 A: no i i don't think it really took 

342.84 344.68 B: (( it's past that stage mhm )) 

344.88 357.98 A: th- that mu- i mean longer than expected either because i mean you really have to like take into account what went on there i mean we moved into iraq so quickly and the way the media like 

357.88 362.89 A: arranged their questions really altered the way people were thinking 

359.50 360.67 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

362.78 376.97 A: and if you really step back and you're like wait a minute here i mean give them a break here you know what's realistic and what's not w- i mean we're not playing like command and conquer it's a computer game i don't know know if you're familiar with 

375.82 377.62 B: no not familiar 

377.50 386.94 A: and i mean it's it's it's a pretty good computer game it's a strategy game but we're not playing that type of game here that's over in an hour 

386.60 387.73 B: right 

386.85 394.31 A: and i mean if you think about like [noise] ah the gulf war i mean we were bombing them for how many hours 

394.03 395.46 B: yeah yeah 

394.55 401.02 A: i mean well i mean not in how many hours how many like we're bombing them for three months previous to ah 

401.46 405.10 A: before they ah just like we had just walked all over them 

404.47 405.86 B: (( mhm )) 

405.19 416.44 A: and it i mean we didn't do that at all i mean we have to go in there and give time for our airforce to do it's job because that's the only way 

416.47 420.88 A: that's going to happen i mean we launched so many missiles there we launched 

420.83 435.23 A: well over like s- seven hundred cruise missiles just cruise missiles that's not even talk- counting any of the other missiles that were launched so i would say we launched about close to two thousand missiles which have to be replaced but ah 

435.83 439.37 A: at i mean not many civilians were killed 

439.20 440.40 B: right 

439.90 449.27 A: you know and there were and the way that it was like the media portrayed it [noise] and a lot of people portrayed it they they were like oh oh oh weapons are 

450.09 455.04 A: what well th- the weapons were well less than one percent 

455.05 456.57 A: (( ah )) 

457.07 466.13 A: e- error they were like one less than one percent error and and anything mechanical electrical like that less than one percent error is pretty decent 

466.52 470.25 A: (( considering what i mean has to go into it )) 

470.83 476.08 A: 'cause i'm a computer science major so i have to do all the math and everything like that and 

474.15 476.43 B: oh okay so you're very knowledgeable 

476.63 481.27 A: and doing all that it's not very it's not the easiest thing [laughter] in the world 

481.48 489.53 A: you know i mean and these are really good engineers that have done that i mean the army has like the biggest core of engineers 

489.08 490.23 B: mhm 

489.61 491.61 A: in the world so 

491.69 499.91 A: they did did put a lot of effort and they spent [noise] a lot of money ah on trying not to kill the civilians and 

499.09 500.66 B: (( right mm )) 

500.33 502.12 A: ah i mean 

503.18 507.54 A: i don't know i think we did a pretty good job overall and i 

507.62 516.82 A: i personally feel that osama bin laden is actually dead i personally feel that saddam hussein is actually dead the only reason i say that is because 

514.42 515.72 B: wow yeah 

516.87 528.82 A: i mean we have and i've seen the technology that because i used to i went for a job interview at s._g._i. which is silicon graphics ah i forget the last name maybe it's like industry i don't know 

528.94 541.92 A: but they make the um some pretty intense graphic hardware for computers and basically where we are today with p._c.s they were 

535.74 536.81 B: uh-huh 

542.04 554.97 A: like in like nineteen eighty five that's like i mean they're really their hardware was just spectacular and they put they just put so much immense 

545.02 546.82 B: (( wow yeah )) 

555.39 568.49 A: ah backing like you you go to an s._g._i. computer you know like well how much do you want it to cost you want it to cost a million dollars they'll make you a million dollar computer you want it to cost ten million dollars they'll make you a ten million dollar computer 

564.34 565.66 B: mhm 

567.96 568.92 B: wow 

568.38 581.77 A: so it's a lot more than the like two thousand dollar computers that like you or i can afford you know [laughter] so ah they so they put a lot of effort and this is the kind of stuff that gets sold to the government 

573.71 575.26 B: right right 

581.39 582.29 B: mhm 

581.68 588.58 A: and that's why and our government has a massive sum of money and that's why i 

587.67 589.98 B: isn't it amazing how it has 

589.68 594.97 A: i mean they they ah how what's the national debt six trillion plus 

594.26 596.46 B: [laughter] 

595.76 599.95 A: just just to be able to say that you you can h- take out that kind of credit
