60.86 71.93 B: um uh unfortunately as far as i can see not um uh public programs are not very much effective 

64.08 67.00 A: (( yeah )) 

71.91 78.37 A: yeah i i think there should be more programs as well i i also think there should be more public programs 

74.69 75.58 B: sorry 

78.58 83.92 B: well i don't know probably hm [lipsmack] 

85.74 95.20 B: i would sa- uh i would welcome more uh t._v. programs probably or uh 

95.38 104.29 B: programs in newspapers uh because uh well all the calls and uh signs in public places are or and uh 

104.33 108.10 B: uh those uh signs on uh 

109.05 111.04 B: [noise] cigarette packs 

110.57 112.57 A: yeah 

111.42 118.63 B: uh looks like they just people don't pay much attention to them even though who never smoke 

116.15 118.53 A: yeah i agree yeah 

118.67 120.67 A: yeah 

121.23 131.50 A: um so do you watch a lot of the ads on t._v. that they have on t._v. have you seen all of them have you seen so you've seen the truth ads on t._v. right 

125.99 127.14 B: excuse me 

130.44 131.75 B: i i've seen what 

131.70 134.94 A: the the truth ads on t._v. have you seen those commercials 

135.87 137.51 B: uh t._v. commercials 

136.77 144.46 A: [noise] yeah i i think they're they're pretty ineffective for for like adult mostly because they're mostly directed at teenagers 

143.99 151.20 B: yeah you know i would yeah i would uh suggest uh like uh um 

151.36 155.22 B: uh if uh more 

155.28 170.16 B: if more callers would participate in popular talk shows and uh that would be more helpful i mean uh it's uh probably would be not so effective if they were 

160.51 162.69 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

170.14 175.55 B: uh if there were special programs uh in the uh i mean the uh 

170.39 171.56 A: the patch 

175.57 187.85 B: targeted to uh smokers but if they if this uh is done in a more subtle way you know not so [laughter] openly or 

187.37 189.32 A: yeah 

187.88 190.51 B: that that would be more effective 

190.56 195.01 A: uh ha- have you have you ever heard about the gum the nicotine gum 

195.95 199.33 B: the government nicotine nicotine what ban 

197.92 206.79 A: yeah the the nicotine gu- the nicotine gum to help uh you quit if you're smoking ha- have you ever tried that with your wife to try and get her to quit 

203.54 205.20 B: oh well 

205.29 212.67 B: i i had something like yeah i had something that but you know the problem with that if uh 

208.96 209.67 A: (( [noise] )) 

211.28 213.08 A: [noise] it's really expensive 

212.99 213.89 B: sorry 

213.73 215.45 A: isn't it really expensive 

215.53 221.56 B: uh i don't know you know the the problem is for example if uh uh in my wife's case uh 

220.94 222.10 A: yeah 

221.49 230.14 B: uh she i think that she she looks at it at smoking as kind of uh a stimulant you know 

229.92 244.88 B: and uh even the most effective like uh things like gum and uh whatever she's not interested at all in uh all those programs and uh because she it's like uh i'm a i would say i'm a tea addict you know i like tea very much and it's uh 

230.04 231.86 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

237.66 238.91 A: [noise] 

244.30 245.41 A: yeah 

244.77 251.83 B: uh uh mind stimulating especially when i'm getting ready for a test and the exam and so on 

251.51 252.76 A: yeah 

251.67 263.34 B: so uh cigarettes uh she is using cigarettes for the same purpose like uh taking uh breaks uh you know and uh she said that uh helps her 

263.14 273.37 B: they help her clear her mind and stuff like that which uh i don't know so [laughter] it's it's extremely difficult to you know to influence uh 

267.14 267.94 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

273.18 274.36 A: yeah 

273.25 278.82 B: heavy smokers and uh she tends to smoke uh even more with time 

278.79 281.30 A: does she smoke like a pack a day or how much 

280.98 287.16 B: well yeah i i would say so she never she never yeah a- approximately 

283.46 284.55 A: wow 

287.19 292.77 A: yeah if she oh if if she didn't smoke wouldn't you guys save like a lot more money [noise] 

288.87 289.66 B: sorry 

292.68 298.97 B: well you know she uh uh it's it's kinda it doesn't uh 

299.24 301.12 B: uh 

301.18 312.04 B: uh matter muc- matter matter too much how much uh uh you earn like uh we we are from europe both and uh now we live in austin and uh 

311.92 319.57 B: uh we are both students and uh uh uh regardless of the fact that we both worked while wh- when we were living in europe 

319.34 320.38 A: yeah 

319.51 331.24 B: uh she tends to she she smoked less but when we moved here we are students now we earn much less still she started to uh smoke more well 

331.22 341.92 B: uh the students uh well uh you know she used to be in a p._h._d. program and uh all that stress and uh it influences 

335.97 336.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

342.15 344.77 B: uh this habit a lot 

344.78 350.93 B: so i guess that was one of the reasons that that she started smoking more 

350.74 351.97 A: (( [noise] [noise] wow )) 

351.04 361.15 B: so it's it's kinda you know it it in oh how the economists say it in elastic demand you know [laughter] so even if uh 

358.73 360.16 A: yeah 

361.01 368.93 B: uh the price for cigarettes is raised like in tex- you know austin in texas uh the state controller 

368.92 371.47 B: uh suggests that uh 

371.37 381.91 B: taxes uh are raised uh on cigarettes uh to you know th- the- there are uh i think there are like budget gaps 

381.78 389.16 B: so it would help the budget but unfortunately it would affect uh people of low incomes 

389.33 401.64 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well well if it if it's any easier you just you then make the nicotine gum cheaper so smokers can quit easier than when when when like even if you made the cigarettes more expensive then 

401.49 410.03 A: sooner or later only the um the richest people would be able to afford it and the poor people would have to buy nicotine gum so then uh the people who couldn't afford cigarettes 

410.02 411.54 A: they they could 

411.37 425.13 A: they they could buy the gum since it's become much cheaper which would allow them to not only make themselves healthier but also make cigarettes [noise] a luxury item and the taxes raised from the luxury items could be to help benefit education and social security in the country 

424.93 435.31 B: well you know maybe you are right actually i have never uh asked her to try this gum maybe they should be the- they should be even more [laughter] popularized more 

431.40 432.85 A: yeah 

435.14 442.27 B: i just uh i just kinda you know gave up [laughter] trying to convince her [laughter] how bad it is 

435.29 437.00 A: yeah 

438.70 441.67 A: yeah yeah 'cause 'cause she yeah 'cause 

441.74 443.70 A: (( she smokes a lot yeah [noise] )) 

443.21 452.16 B: but uh you know maybe if uh i pay more attention to this things and uh try to ask her to convince her to try them and uh 

450.04 451.18 A: mhm 

451.96 458.36 B: may- maybe that would be mo- uh effective i just but she has never tried them and to uh i don't know 

455.00 455.86 A: 'cause 

457.45 467.66 A: yeah y- y- like you know like in some or when you're small sometimes in in america they're show you ads about people's lungs and what they look like like they're they're really like messed up 

467.60 472.67 A: and then they'll show you like really graphic pictures to try and get you to not smoke in the beginning 

472.75 476.47 A: uh have you ever tried just like showing your wife some of those pictures 'cause 

476.68 480.10 A: it it it like they highlight how bad cigarettes is hurting you 

480.29 493.26 B: no i haven't tried that but uh i uh yeah but i know she she uses she uses uh chewing gum so that would be easy for her it would be easy for here to you know to to try [laughter] something different 

486.41 488.17 A: yeah 

489.26 490.97 A: to to transition 

491.36 497.66 A: yeah yeah yeah uh 'cause 'cause you know all this smoking like it it really hurts you you know 

497.99 511.73 B: oh yeah i'm pretty much aware of uh that because my dad smoked and uh i i don't know myself why i do not smoke [laughter] because my brot- because my brother smokes too and like it's you know it's it's stress related in most cases 

498.86 499.97 A: yeah 

503.12 504.88 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

505.75 507.59 A: [laughter] yeah me neither 

508.33 509.19 A: (( oh )) 

511.35 519.26 A: yeah they like you you know if if they can just like do something else to relieve the stress that it it just wouldn't hurt them as much you know 

519.35 520.59 B: yeah 

519.65 523.63 A: (( [noise] yeah like if if they just like exercise or something [noise] )) 

523.41 525.95 B: how about you do you smoke too or 

525.25 528.46 A: no no i i don't smoke yeah [laughter]

526.85 529.71 B: [laughter] you never never tried 

529.33 540.70 A: no no yeah 'cause 'cause like er er well we're we're taught from when we're really young that smoking's bad and then i i just i just made a decision myself that i didn't wanna smoke 

541.09 542.81 A: so i never tried it 

542.53 543.72 B: yeah well 

543.86 546.22 B: i tried when i was like uh
