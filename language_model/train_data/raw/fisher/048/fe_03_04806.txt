0.00 1.91 B: hi i'm lisa from ohio 

1.79 7.14 A: hello my name is mike from oakland uh california uh 

7.89 21.11 A: it's a yeah it's an interesting um topic um smoking in public places i should tell you first um i'm not a militant about it but i am a uh non smoker and have been all my life 

20.99 23.34 A: um however i do 

23.36 30.06 A: deeply believe that um people in public um should have some amount of right to smoking 

30.47 33.33 A: um are you a smoker or what's your feeling 

32.88 42.19 B: i am not a smoker and smoke bothers me [laughter] actually right now i'm pregnant so i really try to stay away from it so even more so than i usually would um 

35.53 36.45 A: (( mm )) 

42.62 46.96 B: i guess for me the the problem i have with smoking compared to other things 

46.40 49.24 A: do you live in a big city or a smaller town by the way 

48.54 51.07 B: um i live in cincinnati so 

50.35 51.36 A: okay 

51.22 55.25 B: big city basically [laughter] not huge but um 

52.16 53.01 A: (( mm )) 

56.21 58.27 B: you know the problem for me is that 

58.63 62.53 B: smoking unlike a lot of other things affects everyone around you 

63.11 64.82 B: because if somebody's smoking 

63.20 69.52 A: well that's certainly true and i know secondary smoke is uh quite dangerous or so i've heard 

68.23 69.19 B: right 

69.28 70.29 B: right 

70.33 72.48 B: so it's kind of hard because 

72.52 77.16 B: you not you know that person isn't just affecting themselves they're affecting everyone around them 

77.28 84.65 B: whereas if somebody's chewing gum or doing something obnoxious it's really only affecting them you know if they're chewing tobacco for instance 

84.93 91.02 B: you know if they're chewing tobacco and they're spitting it well they're [laughter] not spitting it at you it's not really affecting you 

91.47 93.06 B: but when they're smoking 

93.16 96.07 B: you know and and i mean it permeates everything 

96.62 99.66 A: [noise] well that's true it is difficult to get it off uh 

96.77 97.59 B: (( i mean )) 

99.93 108.70 A: uh furniture but um i don't know i realize of course the dangers of lung cancer and secondary smoke and everything but 

108.75 119.96 A: i just feel uh with due respect that um smokers should have the right to smoke somewhere definitely not everywhere and definitely not if it bothers other people but somewhere 

116.25 117.19 B: yeah 

119.93 134.65 A: like here in san francisco we have or no i've heard other cities where if they have a private sealed off room in a bar or restaurant that is constituted a smoking club uh they uh smoking is okay 

119.93 120.80 B: yeah 

135.09 136.25 B: (( and that makes sense )) 

135.38 142.18 A: on the other hand i've heard in the city of new york they are just banning smoking virtually everywhere 

142.40 149.51 B: yeah i think that makes a difference i mean if you have people i mean obviously it is an addiction and it's hard to say that they absolutely can't smoke 

149.78 155.83 B: you know in all public places i think it makes sense but then you look at the cost of a restaurant maybe to have a 

156.04 158.83 B: sealed off area where people can go 

159.02 159.98 B: um 

159.83 169.14 A: [noise] yeah i'm sure it would be uh costly what's the situation in um cincinnati how broad a ban on smoking uh does your city have 

168.91 172.48 B: i have really seen any ban you know there are certain restaurants 

172.43 174.66 A: well can people smoke in bars 

172.70 174.06 B: that are completely 

174.83 177.83 B: people can smoke in bars there are certain restaurants 

176.64 185.59 A: well see that's uh not to interrupt but um we've gone that far in san francisco and oakland that generally smoking is not allowed in bars 

184.75 194.03 B: wow now see that's interesting because there are certain places that i go that i guess i just kinda expect if i'm in a bar i guess i'm just gonna kinda of expect that people are smoking there 

194.09 198.50 B: but if i'm in a restaurant even though a lot of times if i'm sitting in a non smoking section 

198.52 203.49 B: i'll you know if it's if i'm seated beside the smoking section a lot of times i'm still affected by it 

203.21 206.99 A: well see that's the um now there's a point in the 

207.21 221.80 A: san francisco bay area there's no such thing as a smoking section on uh in restaurants uh you can't smoke anywhere at all um i believe our airlines and i think this is true nationally as well as locally 

221.99 224.68 A: they banned smoking sections there 

224.35 225.45 B: mhm 

226.26 232.79 B: yeah i think that's true on airlines yeah i i haven't been on a plane any time very recently at all that as allowed you to smoke 

231.28 233.36 A: no i haven't had the chance either 

233.67 238.55 B: um yeah which i you know on airlines it does make sense because it would be really hard to section off 

238.58 241.40 B: any particular area um 

241.38 249.21 B: the thing that i would find interesting is that you walk into a restaurant there there are a few restaurants in cincinnati that are completely non smoking there aren't any as 

248.14 249.71 A: mhm 

249.08 261.16 B: far as i know there aren't any bans i mean most plac- most restaurants have that option but just some restaurants have voluntarily gone to that but it's always interesting when you walk into a restaurant and they ask you smoking or non smoking and it's seems like 

261.17 266.51 B: inevitably if you're a smok- you know if you say smoking you can get seated quicker than if you say non smoking 

266.46 280.93 A: [mn] well like i'm not surprised as a matter of fact um one of my last major trips was to um reno nevada and nevada is my guess because of the attitude on uh gambling is totally open towards smoking they um 

279.72 280.71 B: right 

281.18 284.36 A: you know every restaurant every bar everywhere 

284.26 297.23 A: you can smoke and um my roommate who um is a smoker was pleased to see that um cigarette prices were probably a dollar a pack or more below the san francisco bay area 

296.34 297.44 B: wow 

297.85 300.01 B: that's interesting well see living in o- 

299.09 303.16 A: does anyone in your family smoke i don't know if you're married or single of course 

302.61 307.65 B: i am married um my husband does not smoke i don't honestly it would be hard for me to marry 

306.25 308.78 A: do you have any kids do any of them smoke 

308.71 312.35 B: um i do not have any kid- well i'm pregnant with my first 

312.15 317.90 A: oh well [laughter] too early for him or her to um consider smoking yeah really 

313.51 314.46 B: [laughter] 

315.07 321.68 B: a little too early yeah um my parents do not smoke they did not smoke when i was growing up um i have 

320.56 331.54 A: well mine uh my dad smoked two cigars a day but then about ten years before he passed away he quit and my mom smoked maybe two cigarettes a year 

327.98 328.77 B: okay 

332.58 335.04 A: [noise] yes [noise] 

333.62 334.89 B: [laughter] 

337.02 341.42 A: [laughter] because i'm on [noise] i'm on the panel you're not 

340.92 342.35 B: [laughter] 

342.01 343.51 A: this is my roommate 

343.89 344.82 A: (( hello )) 

344.69 345.71 B: hi 

345.50 347.08 A: (( yeah hi why are you )) 

347.28 350.55 A: (( talking to him about smoking i'm the one who that smokes cigarettes )) 

350.10 351.70 B: well i don't smoke either 

351.95 353.39 A: (( oh okay )) 

352.36 360.06 B: [laughter] no they don't they don't match you up with anybody in particular who smokes or doesn't smoke it's just kind of a random you just talk about it 

356.55 357.34 A: (( oh )) 

357.54 366.94 A: okay because a a l- okay because some of the issues [sigh] you know we go out to a lot of restaurants but some of the issues about smoking you know 

367.45 368.13 A: (( you )) 

369.21 372.36 B: ye- well and everybody obviously has a different opinion 

372.23 373.17 A: (( need to ask )) 

373.35 382.20 B: you know i mean obviously that that's somewhat impacted by if you smoke or not but other other time it's if you're with somebody who smokes or not you're more 

373.55 376.49 A: (( a smoker yeah well i'm )) 

376.56 377.46 A: okay 

382.60 383.33 A: (( ok- )) 

382.79 385.20 B: you know open to it sometimes i think 

383.52 385.45 A: (( i hear you okay here you go )) 

387.25 388.90 A: okay um we- 

387.93 389.28 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

388.96 390.98 A: we're back yeah he's a 

389.86 391.93 B: he's obviously had a bit about smoking 

392.16 396.93 A: yeah he's a smoker and um you know i i'll occasionally um 

397.01 408.81 A: uh be in the same room when he uh smokes a cigarette but it's okay with me but the uh of course the problem another problem that we all have is just the power of the tobacco lobby i don't know if you um 

401.15 402.12 B: yeah 

409.48 414.99 A: read the story in the papers but apparently a international convention that was originally 

415.52 424.50 A: going to severely restrict no wait a minute what happened was they were going to restrict smoking and advertising to smoking quite a bit 

425.15 430.92 A: the united states as originally originally against it but uh changed its mind 

430.37 432.49 B: mhm that doesn't surprise me 

432.45 441.39 A: no uh well i i am surprised because um president bush and i've no idea what your politics is i would say i'm not 

433.21 434.23 B: there's all 

441.35 445.83 A: an enemy i just have mixed feelings about the man some good some bad 

445.65 458.57 A: um i would think that because he's from the southwest and a lot of his support would be from the south with where a lot of tobacco is grown that he would have just been against anything uh any restrictions on tobacco 

458.68 469.31 A: but apparently what they might have done was figured that um there would be more votes um from non smokers than smokers and that's why they um changed their uh positions 

465.07 466.01 B: mhm 

468.72 470.15 B: yeah possible 

470.53 482.78 B: well and it's interesting too because living ohio living in cincinnati we're we're very close to the kentucky border and in ohio they uh within the last i think six months to a year they they added another tax 

482.34 483.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] mm [noise] )) 

482.92 491.87 B: for cigarettes so it increased the price i don't and i don't smoke so i don't really [laughter] i don't really keep track of cigarette prices but i know it drastically increased it um and they 

490.89 498.29 A: and the city is uh i don't know if it's true or not the city used to be considered quite uh cincinnati quite conservative 

497.69 499.49 B: it is very conservative yeah 

498.34 508.61 A: politically i went to school with a guy who was a life long republican and uh became a judge in uh cincinnati but he probably uh retired by now 

508.71 513.03 A: 'cause i'm you know i'm sixty years old so i may be a little bit older than you 

513.19 514.87 B: a little bit [laughter] 

513.24 518.09 A: obviously i'm i must be older than you because uh here you are expecting your 

516.35 519.61 B: i'm pregnant with my first child so i'm probably not sixty 

518.47 522.59 A: yeah you've got to be uh maybe thirty or a little younger 

520.42 521.54 B: half your age 

522.14 523.55 B: yeah thirty one 

523.39 526.96 A: oh wonderful well how long have you uh been married 

526.48 527.78 B: seven years 

527.70 532.93 A: good well you got married young a lot of people uh might wait a little bit longer 

533.14 534.92 A: and uh here we're 

535.57 547.91 A: just you know very liberal open city um we're having a branch of the national chain hooters open and uh you know no one really cares i mean this city had the love generation acid 

544.43 545.34 B: yeah 

548.38 554.08 A: and uh pot smoking and everything so and topless bars so uh what the heck 

550.85 551.90 B: (( and see this is )) 

553.57 567.37 B: and to me it's ironic that that san francisco has such strict you know ordinances on smoking and cincinnati doesn't and cincinnati is seen as so conservative that i would think they would have more restrictions and san francisco would be very open 

565.33 570.87 A: [noise] well no conservatives usually are laissez faire on uh 

570.95 580.19 A: things like that i mean their reasoning is probably that um they believe that people should have the individual right to choose they should have the right to choose 

572.43 574.20 B: they don't want to take a stance on it 

580.21 582.71 A: to smoke or not to smoke and they're gonna be 

582.76 588.00 A: very leary about um you know situations like that 

586.48 587.39 B: yeah 

587.50 589.12 B: yeah that's true 

589.41 596.58 B: you know as far as the other ques- i guess the other question that it that that they were talking about was um you know whether 

593.80 594.77 A: mhm 

595.65 597.83 A: glad you remember it i forgot 

597.52 599.95 B: it was the um the ads you know
