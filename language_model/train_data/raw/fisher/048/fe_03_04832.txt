0.08 1.48 A: (( tim )) 

1.54 4.13 B: hi there this is kay how're you doing 

3.78 5.48 A: hi kay how're you doing today 

5.08 7.05 B: i'm doing just fine how about you 

6.84 12.78 A: i just want to make sure i heard the ah the topic right they were talking about how'd you act how you'd react in a terrorist thing 

12.16 13.03 B: yes 

13.17 14.91 B: how do you think you would 

13.18 14.71 A: (( hm )) 

15.54 20.38 A: oh boy that's that's very interesting because the other night i mean i'd just seen a ah 

20.40 32.96 A: a twilight ah zone episode that was on ah u._p._n. a new episode and they did the same thing just where ah they had these new people who had moved in and all the neighbors just went completely nuts i mean just because 

24.56 25.76 B: mhm 

33.00 38.71 A: you know these people just kept to themselves and what it turned out was it was it was just ah 

38.54 48.01 A: a couple of military people dressed as civilians that had moved in there to see what'd happen and then like at the end of it you know you saw 'em torch the house and everything 

42.09 42.90 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

47.63 48.77 B: right 

47.97 55.10 A: and the people and the military guys were just doing it like boy if this is the way this country's going to be it's like if anyone anything really does you know 

55.17 67.15 B: see i i think no matter how much training we've got i mean i'm married to a gentlemen he's retired now but he was ah in the sheriff's department and they're trained to be calm and all this now but i think when you're put in that actual situation 

61.32 63.28 A: (( mhm )) 

67.24 78.19 B: i mean i've tried to be calm i was a teacher and all this and that but i don't think i'd be very calm if it was actual terrorism on me or on someone in my family on my homeland i really don't 

70.19 71.92 A: mhm 

78.04 83.28 A: i'm the same way because you know when september eleventh hit i mean that changed the whole country you know 

82.99 85.08 B: oh it sure did mhm 

84.02 95.65 A: i mean no one was expecting it i mean i remember when i saw it on t._v. i just thought you know when i saw the twin towers i saw those planes i just thought oh that's a cool shot and then all of a sudden they hit it you know and i was just like holy moly i mean it was like 

92.25 93.66 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

95.26 108.48 B: well i don't i don't think that anybody over here really realised the capability of what we consider a poor country to have the capability of doing something like that in such magnitude to us totally unaware that it was going to happen 

108.31 110.23 A: i mean 'cause i'm one of them 

110.79 125.74 A: you know i'm this it it's like well what's going on with the airports right now it's like i'll admit it is it is annoying but there's a lot of things out there that are annoying but the thing is i'd rather have it like that and have someone who actually gives a damn you know 

116.26 117.14 B: (( yes mhm )) 

125.67 140.18 B: i would too but it it's just amazing sometimes how many people put it to the test and how far they get through the airport and almost boarding the plane and then they admit they have something just to see if they can get it in there and it makes you realise like you know this could happen again 

125.87 127.11 A: and it's 

133.40 135.77 A: mhm 

139.84 149.23 A: yeah like when you saw those two ah airline employees that that ah actually got through there you know with that i can't remember what it was it was ah some sort of a manicure knife or something you know 

148.55 149.57 B: mhm 

149.53 157.45 A: and then they actually admitted it and i'm just sitting here it's like you know [mn] people like you are just like out there just making problems i mean it's like 

153.32 154.37 B: right and 

156.70 171.29 B: right and and when you when you think of when you think of terrorism you think oh you know machetes and machine guns and all this and that but those guys on those nine eleven planes had box cutters who would think a box cutter would be that much to inspire that much terror and do that much damage 

162.05 162.93 A: (( mm )) 

171.27 172.91 A: that's for sure you know 

172.39 181.66 B: you know i mean it's it's just the guys on one plane that crashed in pennsylvania really tried their best and they did divert it from p- crashing probably into the white house 

181.18 183.26 A: mhm 

181.76 186.62 B: but look at how many of them there were that probably tried to take the few down that were on that plane and they couldn't 

186.60 188.06 A: that's for sure 

187.41 198.51 B: these terrorists really i mean he's he's got and they say they come equipped with wheels they come equipped with you know with the cyanide tablets to take in case they get caught they are determined 

195.51 197.33 A: (( [cough] excuse me )) 

197.57 199.12 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

199.27 208.02 A: that's the thing i'm trying to figure out i mean it's just you know we let who knows how many people in this country you know without asking any questions and very little you know 

205.01 205.84 B: yes 

207.60 219.26 B: i just i mean just like the other night the the trailer load of people that they found that unfortunately some of them had died so the rest of them now are going to get asylum in the united states and i'm thinking wait a minute here 

208.41 209.00 A: (( [mn] )) 

214.36 215.72 A: mhm 

219.28 225.60 B: you know those are the people that are maybe are being planted and that are going to really do some uprising against us one of these days 

224.85 227.02 A: (( mhm ah )) 

226.37 228.06 B: because it could be 

228.46 242.91 B: you know now they say there are a lot of them in the united states and i feel sorry for some of the people who are of the muslim faith and different nationalities like that that are being scorned but have absolutely nothing to do with it and are are more on our side than on the other side 

230.68 232.15 A: mhm 

241.70 243.58 A: mhm 

242.82 247.42 B: but yet you can't you can't ever let your guard down you just really can't mm 

245.84 251.50 A: no no you just you have you have to you have to keep something up a little bit you know 

250.72 252.68 B: yes yes you do and 

251.56 254.48 A: i mean and the thing is i mean i do feel sorry i mean 

254.53 259.30 A: there was this one man i mean he was killed just because he wore a turban you know and 

258.07 266.86 B: and and that's that's what i'm afraid it's going to get to and if it gets to that there's going to be a lot of unnecessary deaths and there's going to be a lot of destruction that should not really happen 

260.28 260.84 A: (( mm )) 

263.48 266.21 A: (( mhm )) 

266.48 275.19 A: and then everyone out there's wondering like why the terror le- level just got raised again you know and i'm just sitting here it's like well why do you think guys you know i mean we've got 

270.55 271.50 B: yes 

273.68 283.93 B: mhm but do you do you know that some do you think that some people really pay much attention to that terror level i mean it's orange and do you think that's going to stop very many people or make them more aware of their surroundings 

283.53 290.18 A: no i mean i'm one of them i'm aware of it when i have to travel and i mean but i'm sorry you know it's like 

284.16 284.95 B: no 

290.29 297.03 A: but you know i'm just one of them i just try and live my live and just you know stay out of harms way and you know not make problems for anyone you know 

296.68 299.19 B: i do to and not make problems i've 

297.18 298.18 A: i mean 

298.53 309.94 A: i mean i'm just one of them you know if we've got a foreigner in the country that's fine you know it's like as long as he's not doing anything that's going to you know that's going to you know ah endanger my way of life or you know or my family or anything like that you know 

301.87 302.70 B: mhm 

308.75 309.46 B: mhm 

309.71 318.26 B: right because there are there are good ones of them just like there are good of us but there are bad ones of them just like there's bad of us you know it doesn't necessarily go along with their nationality mhm 

314.70 316.64 A: mhm 

317.89 327.85 A: i mean it was just like i was saying about that twilight zone episode the day that it comes to something like that where people just go berserk on a hate crime you know and and they just decide you know just because someone 

327.71 333.96 A: you know just for example if someone's wearing an orange robe you know i mean and they decide that that's the thing you know and that's 

330.74 331.64 B: right 

332.98 336.25 B: and and they do and you know i just i read in 

335.31 341.64 A: that's when we're going to be in sorry shape that's when i- i'm going to more or less i'm just going to board my house up you know 

341.30 353.78 B: you almost have to but you know i i have thought that this coun- this country had come a long way and i was reading in a people magazine the other day there's a place down in georgia that has separate proms the whites had a prom and the blacks had a prom 

353.43 355.31 A: mhm 

353.75 357.32 B: and the kids wanted it like that and i thought now they haven't really learned anything 

357.00 357.87 A: nope 

357.74 364.74 B: you know because that's that's just reverting right back to where they were a hundred years ago with the and all of that 

364.69 365.69 A: well 

364.80 370.33 B: and when it comes to terrorism i don't think they're going to they're going to shoot first and ask questions later 

370.01 383.22 A: i know and you can't i mean you just can't go off like that totally i mean it was it was like this movie i saw one time i don't know if you're ever familiar with it but it's like it was a steven spielberg called under siege two you know and did did you ever see that movie 

372.58 373.32 B: no 

373.63 375.01 B: you cannot do that 

380.43 381.26 B: mhm 

382.30 383.89 B: i haven't seen that one mhm 

383.26 394.59 A: it's back then see it's not like you realise it but like okay they were talking about the mean bad guy who'd dumped the the satellite system and he knew exactly where to put it which was on a train you know 

393.91 395.21 B: mhm 

394.57 396.68 A: and he knew that that was the perfect place 

396.57 409.56 A: where they could keep moving and when they went through this certain area which was called dark territory you know he could he could he could rig the satellite you know to blow up planes right in mid air you know and then the guys back on the ground who are trying to find out where this who this guy is 

404.55 405.73 B: right 

409.45 418.75 A: you know and what what his deal is and where he's located and why he's doing it and one of the generals it's like you know you'd think we'd have learned something by now you know 

418.36 428.15 B: you would think we'd learn like i mean i like now we've raised we've raised orange and i live in indiana so i know that the indi- five hundred is going to be one of the places they're really going to be watching and protecting 

422.21 423.85 A: (( and mm )) 

428.22 438.48 B: i don't think people should stay at home all the time that don't let the terrorist ruin your life and don't let them dictate like that but i think people do need to be a little bit more aware of what's out there 

431.10 432.09 A: no 

438.29 453.27 A: i mean i'm just one of them it's like i don't have any children yet and i'm getting married in about a month you know and i'm just one of them i'm scared to death you know because when i do have a child you know it just you know it's like the way these people are and you know some of them don't even protect their children that good you know 

442.46 443.48 B: mhm 

452.80 454.26 B: they don't they 

453.40 458.96 A: and i'm just wondering it's like ah like ah what's her name that just got found ah ah what's her name the one ah 

458.86 463.48 B: oh the the one that was found up in the woods behind her house mhm 

460.99 464.65 A: yeah the one yeah it's like i can't remember how it was 

463.77 466.76 B: i can't think now i can't draw a blank i can see her 

465.14 468.50 A: yeah the one that was all ov- the one that was all over the news you know 

467.83 468.72 B: right 

468.81 475.33 A: i mean and they wonder why that happened i'm just sitting here it's like because it's like you know you guys aren't even watching you know your own kids you know 

474.79 476.23 B: (( [mn] no )) 

475.55 483.34 A: it's like i mean i you can't just sit there and handcuff 'em to you you know it's like you know and protect them that way but i mean just use some common sense you know 

483.16 487.99 B: you have to use commonsense you just have to i mean ah like i said being married to an ex-cop 

487.88 501.90 B: i'm more aware of all this because i had it drove in me all my life and i used to work nights as a waitress and when i came out i watched who was outside around in the parking lot and if i saw something i didn't like i went back in and got the bartender to walk me to my car 

496.56 498.25 A: mhm 

501.67 510.41 A: it was the same way like the other night someone knocked on my door and it was about two thirty in the morning and i couldn't believe anyone would knock on my door you know at that time i mean but i live in an apartment complex 

506.99 507.77 B: oh 

510.40 523.52 A: but you now i was very cautious i said who is it and then at first it's like the person didn't even say anything and i just said you can either tell me who it is or else i can have nine one one here in less than a minute you know [laughter] and then he said what then he said and then he actually had the nerve to say 

519.26 520.49 B: mhm 

523.44 536.80 A: to say you know you don't have to get all defensive and i'm just sitting here it's like all i asked you was 'who is it' you know i'm going to say yeah and i'm just going to and and i'm and like i told him i said i'm going to tell you one of two things one either you've got the wrong place 

528.05 529.66 B: (( mhm but who wouldn't be )) 

536.67 539.47 A: or two you're someone i know and i'm going to let you in you know 

539.19 546.98 B: right and that's caution like at two thirty my husband had a liver transplant three years ago and i stayed by myself in an apartment in indi- and i'm from a small town 

546.63 547.54 A: mhm 

546.91 559.03 B: and it was a residential apartment type building and one time at midnight two black guys knocked on my door and i was scared to death because but then i happened to think well they probably knew whoever lived there before 

552.69 553.76 A: mhm 

554.91 556.07 A: mhm 

558.64 559.82 A: mhm 

559.23 564.03 B: i didn't answer it they knew i was there because the t._v. was on and everything i just didn't answer it and they went away but 

564.41 576.38 B: people need to be i mean if you'd have opened that door no telling what would have happened and that's just what it is with terrorism you've got to be like we're we're kind of prepared here we've got a small supply of water and food and we've got the batteries and the 

568.38 569.36 A: yeah 

576.28 584.25 B: battery operated radio and and things like that because i i don't think it's going to come but i want to be halfway prepared if it does 

583.67 585.12 A: mhm 

584.52 596.37 B: and i think that's just commonsense they're they're it's just like the and everything maybe maybe hopefully we'll never get hit but you have to have a few little things ahead just in case we didn't go out and buy a gas mask and we won't 

595.78 597.04 A: (( mhm m- )) 

596.42 599.89 B: but because if it comes to that a gas mask is not going to do any good
