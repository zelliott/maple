1.14 3.56 A: (( hello my name is winston )) 

3.35 5.72 B: hi my name is ben 

5.78 7.95 A: ah could you just repeat that please 

8.19 9.32 B: benjamin 

9.10 10.16 A: benjamin 

10.25 12.10 A: hi benji it's nice to meet you 

10.30 11.25 B: yes 

12.36 13.73 B: nice to meet you 

14.42 15.83 A: where are you from 

15.67 18.36 B: ah san francisco and yourself 

16.97 24.79 A: ah good i'm from tennessee i believe we have to ah have a discussion about t._v. trials ah 

19.79 20.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

21.59 22.22 B: (( [noise] )) 

22.95 26.39 B: mhm 

24.79 32.77 A: t._v. criminal trials [laughter] this is something i don't have very much opinion on can you start maybe you can help me 

32.75 34.82 B: sure ah 

35.89 42.71 B: i guess this subject is the high profile ah criminal ah stuff at court 

43.14 51.09 B: ah does televised and the only one that i know of is that o. j. simpson trial which was televised 

50.81 52.40 A: that pretty famous one 

52.66 58.30 B: yeah so that's the only one that i know do you know any other 

58.41 63.94 A: not really i'm not an avid t._v. fan in the first place but ah i did also follow the 

64.49 74.51 A: the um o. j. simpson trial and ah i've got a very open mind about this you know i i suppose for the average man it's it's it's a good thing to 

75.22 77.48 A: (( ah see ah )) 

78.29 80.87 A: (( how it is to appear in in court )) 

80.92 81.80 B: (( ahah )) 

81.35 89.95 A: ah it's it could be good or it could be bad depending on what happens to the person involved [laughter] 

85.55 86.58 B: yeah huh 

89.25 95.93 B: [laughter] right [laughter] well if she can get off you know it's good for the 

92.34 93.07 A: but 

96.29 98.66 B: (( ah defendant )) 

98.50 107.49 A: yeah i was you know it's this is something that ah i suppose like all else it's some it's a part of the learning curve and ah 

106.00 107.77 B: (( mhm )) 

108.91 111.40 A: i can't find anything against it really 

111.47 117.00 A: ah the only problem i have i is if the members of the jury are allowed to look at the 

117.42 122.61 A: at the t._v. nets in that particular period i don't think that would be a good thing 

122.29 124.36 B: right 

123.07 131.63 A: but then again i'm not very keen on ju- juries anyway i think it's better to get a properly educated um and ah 

132.44 136.21 A: (( judge or something like that you know they somebody who really knows the law )) 

136.53 143.29 A: because ah juries are inclined to be influenced by t._v. but i don't think this is what we are supposed to be discussing 

144.03 146.80 B: well it has to do with the court 

144.48 146.31 A: (( we might be off the subject )) 

147.31 152.80 A: yeah i don't quite know what they really want us to discuss in this [noise] particular instance 

153.03 156.99 B: what do you think it's a good thing or a bad thing to 

157.18 164.18 B: have ah high profile ah cases on television i guess that's the topic 

164.75 166.38 B: is yay or nay 

167.05 180.91 A: well i suppose in a way i think it's a good idea because if these people they realize you can't go around murdering people or defrauding people or whatever and certainly part of that education is to let let's get away from murder that's pretty simple but 

180.86 184.75 A: it can't do ah say a a high profile fraud case 

184.99 186.62 B: mhm 

185.15 190.23 A: ah you might as a layman you might think to yourself you know it might be nice to 

190.29 200.10 A: screw people for a bit of money now and again and then you realize no this is not the right thing to do because you can get into serious trouble so maybe it's a part of a good learning curve how do you feel 

200.12 203.40 B: well we have court t._v. for those things [laughter] 

203.53 204.98 A: (( is that ri- oh )) 

204.71 206.45 B: [laughter] 

205.11 209.06 A: oh well you know as i say i don't watch t._v. particularly often 

208.34 210.07 B: right right 

209.31 211.09 A: i'm too busy but ah 

211.14 215.41 A: i would imagine it's just like everything else it's part of the learning learning um 

215.43 216.93 A: education system 

215.67 217.58 B: right 

217.83 218.81 A: this isn't 

218.09 221.10 B: i mean it's up to the judge whether 

221.30 229.01 B: the judge is going allow it and allow television in his ah or her courtroom 

228.74 231.37 A: (( ah well there you you've got something there now )) 

231.61 235.62 A: i didn't know that i thought it was ah you know it's everybody's right 

236.09 241.78 A: to be televised so ah it it depends on the judge whether the wants to to allow it or not 

236.27 237.40 B: no 

241.08 247.16 B: right right the judge ah ah allows simpson's case to be televised 

247.44 253.07 A: (( and if he didn't allow it would there be redress against him or not or would it be )) 

252.21 257.95 B: i don't know it's his courtroom so he can do whatever he wants in that courtroom 

255.18 255.98 A: oh 

256.61 262.03 A: well you see there you've already taught me something so maybe it's a good thing [laughter] 

261.69 263.57 B: [laughter] yeah 

263.89 264.90 B: i mean 

265.66 269.24 B: having a high profile everyone's [sigh] is 

269.33 274.31 B: gets their celebrity status and you know everyone's focused on it 

274.44 284.10 B: and my opinion is that i don't think it's a good thing ah to televise high profile clients or ah cases on television 

284.56 286.80 B: um just because 

287.88 291.59 B: ah i think the court system should you know 

291.99 300.45 B: ah should take the case as it comes and it they shouldn't be influenced or biased to the public 

301.09 302.20 A: (( that's true )) 

301.28 306.00 B: and even though the jury are supposed to be unbiased 

306.83 310.90 B: you know if they go home and watch television and they're on it [laughter] 

311.50 314.17 B: (( ah i think they are going to be biased )) 

314.51 317.90 B: i mean people are going to be making phone calls you know 

318.05 320.54 B: like when o. j. simpson's case 

320.07 320.86 A: (( mm )) 

321.22 328.00 B: ah the jurors are sent back to the hotel and they're not allowed to watch television 

327.97 328.94 A: (( oh yes )) 

329.04 333.97 B: yeah and they're not allowed to make phone calls 

334.66 338.59 B: well how are you going to stop them 

339.45 350.23 A: that's a pretty good question i mean you know wh- wh- and not only that but people will be phoning in their relations and friends will probably be phoning in because people will say gee you know you guys look pretty good on t._v. or you look pretty bad 

339.63 341.01 B: [sigh] so 

350.23 352.67 B: right right 

350.50 360.03 A: so instead of of ah maybe ah ah concentrating on on what you have to decide you might be concentrating on what you look like and 

359.44 361.00 B: [laughter] 

360.10 363.12 A: mannerisms you have to speak and things like that so 

363.24 368.19 A: you know there's always there's always a a an up and a down side in everything 

363.53 364.60 B: yeah 

367.53 371.01 B: i think there's just way too much distraction 

371.81 377.19 B: ah the court case should you know the judge should take care of it and as you mention 

377.21 379.97 B: about the jury i 

380.90 383.28 B: if i were the defendant 

383.91 387.94 B: i'd be pretty reluctant for 

388.46 392.25 B: to have a jur- jury you know tried me 

392.37 394.18 B: first there's the judge 

395.60 399.20 B: just because i think there's too much problems um 

399.31 404.59 B: too much bias ah too much prejudice too much everything 

404.66 410.02 A: oh yes and especially if it's televised because then it becomes a a it's it might become a 

410.21 411.37 A: um 

411.86 413.40 A: (( what's the word ah )) 

413.50 415.74 A: (( when you're worried about yourself ah )) 

416.07 418.00 B: mhm 

416.08 418.42 A: (( maybe make it a personal ah )) 

418.90 420.14 A: appearance 

420.18 423.54 A: ah it's more important than than what you decide at the end of the day 

420.23 422.02 B: mhm 

424.18 430.17 A: so that that could be a danger but on the other hand i think ah as i said in the beginning i'm i'm very open about this 

424.43 426.42 B: right right 

430.32 431.46 A: ah 

431.74 434.73 A: one the the the upside is is that we 

435.06 448.75 A: ah we get maybe if if if a case is ah goes against the defendant and we've felt before we started off that we didn't like this guy then we'd feel pretty good about and we'd say okay crime doesn't pay 

448.70 449.74 B: [laughter] 

448.92 451.74 A: (( but if it turned out against him we might say well it )) 

451.79 453.70 A: you know maybe it does pay so [noise] 

453.73 457.65 A: (( i think all in all it's ah if i had to vote i would say no )) 

457.92 460.87 B: (( uh-huh well it does flaw and you know should )) 

458.55 460.73 A: but there's there's definitely a lot do it 

461.55 465.08 B: yeah there's flaws you know should they 

465.13 465.92 B: (( in )) 

466.85 472.07 B: and i'd rather be judged by the judge you know i think 

470.49 480.18 A: yes i would certainly do it's it's a professional person and you know he's been taught to be unbiased and this is the whole thing you see the moment you televise it you gonna be 

480.29 481.88 A: bigoting in a way 

482.16 483.95 B: right right i mean 

482.81 485.05 A: [noise] the bias and you're going to 

485.25 491.42 A: ah but it not only just yourself it's it it can go as far as the judge i mean the judge might 

491.48 497.71 A: decide he better start looking a little bit better on the t._v. or something like that instead of concentrating on the case 

495.45 499.25 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

497.92 506.84 A: oh you know every every one of us has an ego to a certain extent and ah it's possible that he might decide well you know ah i'd better go and get ah 

502.12 502.96 B: oh 

507.21 510.86 A: a new hair style or something like that [laughter] 

510.26 517.56 B: ah too much distraction i totally agree you know taking to comb their hair [laughter] 

512.07 512.90 A: yeah 

515.95 516.86 A: yeah 

516.70 518.52 A: but then on the other hand the guy in 

518.32 531.75 A: the you know a lot of the criminals certainly now days instead of doing hard labor they sit in the in their cells watching t._v. and they might pick up a couple of ins and outs to defend themselves next time round so that that's also not a good thing hm 

525.48 526.14 B: [laughter] 

531.10 535.93 B: right yeah i mean i agree 

533.93 537.00 A: and more and more i think i'm starting to vote against it 

536.91 542.08 B: [laughter] right i just see it as a big distraction 

543.17 548.01 B: i mean it's like when you're working you know if your entire family comes over 

547.80 548.64 A: yeah 

548.02 555.45 B: to your office and goes hey ah what are you doing this and that you know it's a distraction it's a place of work 

554.94 557.83 A: that's very true it is it is a distraction 

557.88 563.78 B: and the courtroom i feel is the same thing only the pertinent people should be attending 

564.96 567.89 B: ah that has a a matter 

568.30 570.02 B: in the trial 

570.38 573.32 B: whether it's the defendants or plaintiffs 

573.56 575.97 B: ah families friends whoever 

576.29 580.30 B: but why does the television crew people have to be in there 

581.39 584.29 B: 'cause they wanna share it with the rest of the world 

581.42 582.38 A: (( yeah right )) 

586.67 595.27 A: (( yes and then they're going another month or so that and you think to yourself well maybe it would be good to televise things like this then the rest of the world know )) 

595.19 596.08 B: (( uh-huh )) 

595.36 597.24 A: that we've got a fantastic 

597.41 599.66 B: [laughter] technology 

597.78 599.89 A: ah legal system and and watch
