44.28 45.51 B: exactly 

45.99 57.19 A: but you know basically like um you know just follow instructions really you've got to try not to panic which is hard to do sometime you know 'cause a lot of people don't know to um [noise] take you know handle situations like that [noise] 

49.89 50.81 B: yeah 

57.09 66.34 B: that would be the the worst thing is is not to panic and and to have a radio that you could uh be able to you'd have to have battery powered radio

91.63 92.72 B: uh-huh 

92.15 104.31 A: uh-huh [noise] and um i'm not in that [noise] area but um i used to work in that area and thank god i wasn't down there at the time [noise] uh-huh but the whole city was like [noise] in an uproar you know 

92.86 94.37 B: oh my goodness 

97.11 98.32 B: oh my 

99.35 101.63 B: exactly that's that's great 

103.79 105.37 B: mhm mhm 

104.35 108.18 A: because so much had happened at in that at that point [noise] [noise] 

106.90 107.87 B: mhm 

108.58 118.91 B: yeah my my husband was a volunteer fire fighter and he went to new york afterwards and volunteered up there for a couple of weeks so he knows how it was too 

118.42 121.02 A: oh yeah oh wow so where you from 

120.44 122.05 B: i'm in missouri 

121.71 125.67 A: okay and he came all the way from missouri to new york oh that's wonderful 

123.55 132.32 B: oh yeah he he was a volunteer fire fighter for forty years he just recently uh quit doing it he's gotten a little older now 

132.33 133.42 A: uh-huh 

132.41 136.83 B: and this was of course before i met him we've only been married about nine months mhm 

136.06 141.86 A: [noise] oh okay okay wow so um did he get recognition for that i know he did 

140.60 146.09 B: uh ye- somewhat but he does- he doesn't do things for recognition 

144.20 153.21 A: [noise] yeah understand that but i say he just automatically deserves it you know [noise] because there was so much you know so many fire fighters got hurt and killed and 

148.94 150.31 B: yeah yeah 

152.27 155.58 B: oh oh i know it was t- just terrible uh-huh 

153.23 154.29 A: you know 

154.71 155.89 A: it was 

155.57 158.32 B: yeah he um does oh 

158.17 173.05 B: if we go along and there's an accident or something he stops and you know gives first aid and and does all of this but he used to live down by the st louis missouri area and was an active he's got a lot of plaques and stuff from things that he has done and yeah he's 

166.90 167.85 A: uh-huh 

170.81 171.93 A: okay 

172.84 180.68 B: certainly got his recognition but now we moved up northern missouri and there's not the oh 

176.16 177.24 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

181.06 186.25 B: [sigh] it's a smaller we're further out from town so he can't be a first responder 

185.91 187.81 A: mhm 

186.28 188.44 B: so therefore he's not 

188.35 203.09 B: able to uh do like he did then but you know and and a thing i've thought about terrorism too i think well maybe i'm safer for something like that to happen because i live in rural america you know out we're 

199.41 200.40 A: (( [noise] )) 

201.15 202.09 A: uh-huh 

203.36 211.05 B: from demoines iowa it's a hundred miles and so we're a a hundred miles basically from any large town 

206.02 207.20 A: okay 

210.57 214.42 A: right any cities and stuff like that right mhm 

212.19 224.81 B: right so i don't to me maybe that's false security uh thinking that we're safer from something 'cause there's nothing now i moved from leavenworth kansas and that was where i was from and i always thought well that would 

221.47 222.67 A: [noise] okay 

224.66 236.30 B: be maybe an area that that would could be hit for the fact that we had fort leavenworth which we had a lot of allied officers you know came in there for training and i always thought that that would be a place that would be 

227.28 228.97 A: right 

229.61 230.50 A: (( right )) 

230.58 236.60 A: (( right )) 

237.03 238.00 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

237.05 239.71 B: a target you know so to speak 

238.20 241.16 A: right right 

239.81 244.02 B: and uh do you feel less safe now since all this has gone on 

243.92 245.90 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

244.83 246.67 B: yeah i would imagine so 

246.35 255.35 A: yeah because now i'm i'm i'm i'm supposed to be moving to the city not exactly that part [noise] but you know just in manhattan in in general 'cause i live in the bronx now 

254.96 255.90 B: uh-huh 

255.39 259.40 A: and you know i'm kinda nervous of living here because the whole of manhattan is a target [noise] 

259.17 260.27 B: right 

259.21 273.51 A: and that's a city that's mainly the city of new york [noise] you know and um i'm kind of leery of moving there [noise] you know because i [noise] i do believe they're gonna hit again i hate to say it [noise] but i do i do believe they're gonna hit again [noise] mhm 

261.84 262.83 B: mhm 

264.80 265.83 B: mhm 

268.46 269.39 B: i think 

269.42 270.25 B: yeah 

270.66 277.49 B: oh i think you're right i i my husband feels the same way and i i think definitely that it's going to happen 

274.56 276.06 A: (( [noise] )) 

276.02 284.58 A: [noise] as a matter of fact right now in new york is on a code orange you know what that is right [noise] right and we are on that 'til memorial day 

281.12 282.73 B: yes i do uh-huh 

284.12 286.23 B: oh i didn't know that uh-huh 

284.46 298.89 A: [noise] so right and then so [noise] we've got national guards on the subway you know the subway and stuff like that and all like the empire state building statute of liberty um same places like that and and they're still not it still not accurate because they don't [noise] really know where they might hit 

289.31 290.28 B: mhm 

291.54 292.47 B: mhm 

292.66 294.29 B: right uh-huh 

298.72 305.46 A: and they're saying like the [noise] the new movies that just came out make sure it's in all that and they might try to bomb the movie theater it's a it's a big thing 

301.93 302.82 B: right 

304.01 305.32 B: oh my 

305.64 316.66 B: see and see i've always lived in in so in rural america i've always lived in uh leavenworth with my biggest town i lived there my entire life until i got married and moved to missouri 

311.16 313.72 A: (( mhm )) 

314.58 317.50 A: [noise] [noise] uh-huh 

316.50 330.08 B: and so i've never lived around a large city i mean we were close to kansas city but yet we were still in in you know a smaller town and i don't i just don't think i can handle living with that many people 

322.69 325.66 A: [noise] 

327.56 329.73 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

330.24 334.31 B: you know i just uh i'm well i'm i'm a farm gal 

334.50 345.37 B: and i just don't think i could stand living around and and the the fear of terrorism too and i just like i say i think i'm probably i feel safer being 

345.64 347.57 B: down here where we're at 

346.81 348.18 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

347.70 354.11 B: away from a large city and uh so i don't know maybe that's false security too you don't know 

348.97 350.50 A: mhm 

353.91 356.01 A: mhm that's right 

354.53 359.53 B: but i i think you're probably right that they ca- uh likely will hit again 

358.98 365.43 A: [noise] yeah i truly believe it and and they even said it on on news and radio [noise] like with courses to take 

365.30 366.24 B: mhm 

365.39 374.37 A: and and be careful riding the subway [noise] and all type of things the bus look who's next to you and see if there's any empty bags laying around and stuff like that [noise] you know 

370.23 371.01 B: oh 

372.43 373.78 B: (( oh [lipsmack] )) 

374.05 380.44 B: is it isn't that just scary that we have we have to live our life in fear you know 

375.72 377.09 A: yeah it is 

378.64 386.39 A: [noise] yeah and and and and that got you know to be honest i don't know how long that might go on 'cause we on code orange to [noise] national memorial day 

386.16 387.10 B: mhm 

386.46 394.01 A: the- they might me like assuming that's when it's gonna happen and then it happens after that [noise] you know and that's what's scary 

391.31 392.46 B: yes 

393.17 407.66 B: mhm because maybe they're assuming that will happen then and that's why uh they're doing all these precautions and then the terrorists are waiting and you know to throw 'em off guard you know throw everybody off guard oh yeah you think it's gonna happen on memorial day but it's not going to 

397.96 398.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

403.10 404.12 A: uh-huh 

407.41 410.02 A: (( [noise] right )) 

407.68 414.05 B: uh just to to throw people off guard yeah it just um oh i don't know the whole world has changed 

410.14 412.39 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

414.14 417.23 B: uh because of nine one one and uh 

418.25 422.06 B: it's not we we none of us feel as safe as we used to 

421.17 427.11 A: [noise] [noise] that's right that's right not not like we used to you know before when you have no fear until it happens [noise] 

426.31 428.04 B: mhm right 

427.01 441.61 A: mhm and we we thought well really most people in the united states thought that we were so powerful that it wouldn't happen and always had it [noise] in the back of my head that messing with these people that [noise] we we we were playing a dangerous game because the type of man he was 

433.09 434.15 B: mhm 

441.00 442.89 B: yes right 

441.49 448.29 A: you know and like they don't know if he's living or if he's dead i truly believe he's living and uh-huh 

446.11 453.15 B: oh i think so too i i think i i think so too unless they find a body you might you might as well assume he's still alive 

452.10 453.48 A: right exactly 

453.41 454.26 B: yeah 

453.47 468.02 A: and and that's what's bad because they're giving the media is getting it's really the media that's hyping it up and they're getting the information from the government and they're trying to almost say that he's dead but they don't have no proof you know and they can't lead people on that way because like i say it he's not dead until 

458.26 459.19 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

465.71 466.62 B: no 

467.32 468.53 B: no not 

467.92 471.18 A: like you said until the body comes up uh-huh 

469.33 474.45 B: that's right because you have to assume that he is still alive and still giving orders 

473.85 474.77 A: uh-huh 

474.35 484.75 B: and he's a and i said the people in united states we don't realize how good we have it you know with our freedom the way it is we have the right to choose where we want to move 

483.34 486.92 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

484.66 495.44 B: and what kind of a job maybe jobs are hard to find but you have the ability to go look no one tells you you can't go look today for a job you you know our freedom is the most important thing 

491.63 493.61 A: (( [noise] [noise] right exactly )) 

493.79 494.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

494.64 503.22 A: [noise] exactly and then everything else follows behind that [noise] [noise] you know 'cause if you don't have your freedom then you don't have you know you don't have nothing [noise] 

497.52 500.03 B: yes yes it does and uh 

500.90 501.72 B: no 

502.47 512.02 B: no we don't no if we don't if we don't have our freedom and do you think that we were right then to go to uh to go over and uh and fight in iraq like we just did 

503.43 504.40 A: no 

504.49 505.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

510.90 514.86 A: [noise] [noise] well actually my my personal it's only my opinion 

514.41 515.38 B: (( mhm )) 

514.66 529.02 A: i don't [noise] i don't think we we well the united states is always getting involved in something [noise] but i don't think we had any right to go over to iraq the the religion and what they believe in and take that country over i i really don't think that that was our you know our right 

518.23 519.30 B: right 

527.49 537.32 B: [mn] i i don't know i'm not real g- now my husband could argue with you back and forth on that 'cause he's more political than i am i'm i never am sure and uh unless i 

531.66 533.15 A: [noise] uh-huh 

537.42 544.30 B: know it for a hundred percent then i i just kind of sit on the sidelines and watch but i had a son that was in desert storm 

538.71 540.62 A: (( [noise] right )) 

541.30 542.31 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

543.89 544.87 A: okay 

544.23 553.13 B: and uh so i've been you know to that point yeah been involved and i the thing i guess i guess i don't want 

546.67 548.76 A: you've been involved uh-huh 

553.19 560.55 B: the terrorists to feel like that we're weak that they can come over here and do anything they want and we don't retaliate 

556.25 557.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

559.73 563.34 A: right that's true too yeah that that's true too [noise] 

560.86 561.71 B: mhm 

562.10 568.61 B: you know and then i feel like you know look how many of our people died in nine one one who were innocent people so 

565.99 569.34 A: [noise] oh yeah [noise] 

568.78 572.29 B: if you don't do something about that you're 

570.44 572.95 A: about it it'll happen again 

572.30 577.63 B: yeah you're sending them a message that it's okay so so i guess it's kinda like 

573.78 575.90 A: that right that's true 

577.60 580.78 A: it's a it's a half it's a fifty fifty type [noise] 

579.30 588.61 B: [lipsmack] it is you you wonder if you're we really don't have a right to go to another country and take it over but then again those people over there had no freedom 

588.69 595.26 B: uh with saddam hussein and if we don't do that are we sending a message that it's okay 

594.29 597.76 A: it's okay to do that basically it's almost like slavery 

595.47 596.60 B: yeah 

597.36 599.89 B: yeah right oh my gosh and don't get 

598.12 599.37 A: actually
