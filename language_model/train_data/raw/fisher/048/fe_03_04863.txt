186.58 188.27 B: yeah yeah 

188.93 198.04 B: it a [sigh] i mean it i- i- [sigh] it's pretty amazing that that whole terrorist thing how they can they can get these guys to just so blindly 

198.28 205.88 B: um you know it they they're they're just so blindly dedicated to this this terrorist cause that they just 

203.54 205.35 A: yeah 

205.93 210.10 B: kill innocent people and and and i mean 

208.29 210.30 A: yeah exactly 'cause it's 

210.27 215.11 B: like what kind of religion is that is what i keep thinking 

214.74 217.41 A: right well and it's and it's 

215.30 217.43 B: like this is a the a r- 

217.72 228.41 A: it's like they're you know it's the extreme it's like this extreme view because it's the idea that like i mean it's the same thing when you think about it i mean like um 

228.37 232.48 A: to use an example i mean like in you know germany during world war two 

232.33 238.31 A: was a was a supposed christian nation just like america was a q- you know quote unq- christian nation 

235.53 236.33 B: yeah 

237.97 238.78 B: yeah 

238.10 250.01 A: and yet at the same time they were able to get their people to do such incredibly horrible things just like sending the like you know these terrorists like and totally like take away that feeling of like 

244.78 246.59 B: yeah yeah 

249.81 250.67 B: yeah 

250.03 261.00 A: no matter how strongly you believe in something or you're arguing with someone you don't wanna kill them you know you if they're arguing against them you want that feeling and yet they can take that away and like just 

254.92 256.69 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

258.84 269.99 B: oh it's it's just it's d- ah [sigh] i i think they get 'em in these camps and things and they and they lit- literally can just brainwash these people and they can control information 

264.91 266.04 A: right 

270.10 271.28 A: right 

270.12 274.21 B: you know and that that's that's what baghdad i mean and this whole iraq thing they 

274.41 278.19 B: they control information and propaganda 

277.60 279.87 A: mhm 

278.10 280.57 B: is a is a powerful 

280.39 281.64 B: tool 

281.42 288.32 B: at at at steering people and and fear right which is kind of along with propaganda 

285.55 286.40 A: mhm 

288.09 302.63 B: whether it's nazi germany or or baghdad iraq fear and propaganda make people really really loyal and and it just creates this whacked out mentality i jus- just i i don't understand it but 

288.18 289.05 A: (( mhm )) 

292.00 293.03 A: mhm 

293.09 295.04 A: mhm 

296.21 298.75 A: mhm 

300.96 315.35 A: yeah yeah there's yeah there's something that i- yeah you definitely have to like ah you know supply something w- someone with something like greater to like get them to do something like that and that's the thing it's like the idea that you know that they're doing 

315.34 318.56 A: you know that america's like you know the root of all evil 

318.22 319.34 B: yeah 

318.76 328.48 A: and so by coming over and like you know crashing a plane into a building it's not even just like killing innocent people it's that you're like striking terror in the hearts of like all the rest of america you know 

325.35 326.99 B: yeah yeah 

327.13 339.28 B: you know you know my thought is if they really really wanted to freak our country out [laughter] if they really wanted to freak our country out they'd go like bomb a grade school building with kids in it well 

332.63 333.49 A: mhm 

338.89 342.84 A: well yeah definitely definitely yeah 

340.05 343.22 B: i mean talk about [laughter] i mean talk about 

343.03 350.88 B: [laughter] i mean sure th- we'd lose some lives but that to me i was thinking about i was talking with somebody about that i'm like this is bad no doubt trade center's bad but 

350.66 359.83 B: if they really wanna freak us out go after our kids in a grade school that would like be that would be even i think that would instill even 

351.46 352.11 A: (( mhm )) 

354.59 356.69 A: (( mhm right )) 

359.78 368.49 B: even more um anger on on the u._s.s side than probably even the trade centers going down [laughter] 

364.22 365.47 A: oh definitely 

368.16 376.68 A: definite oh definitely definitely i mean i think that would be yeah that'd be huge i mean you know and i and i think you know like in that same note i mean 

377.40 389.29 A: you know in some ways like the trade center [noise] thinks that it was so direct um you know it was just you know just y- buildings just falling was like it was so it was so immediate there wasn't a lot of like 

381.49 383.19 B: (( mhm mhm mhm mhm )) 

389.58 397.14 A: gas that was happening afterwards for weeks or something like that like it would be in say like like a biological attack or a chemical attack 

394.96 399.69 B: yeah and not knowing what what the after effects are gonna be and all of that 

398.72 410.57 A: right exactly i mean i think i think for a lot of people like you know 'cause i- like the whole chemical attack idea is even more out there and it would be more detrimental because it would last longer 

407.68 412.83 B: well yeah what a like that letter like that letter thing that letter thing what was that ah 

411.77 415.82 A: yeah like the anthr- yeah like the anthrax thing yeah 

412.95 419.37 B: anthrax i mean that freaked a lot of people out for a long time because to your point you don't know when it's gonna end you know 

416.55 417.74 A: right 

419.33 430.11 A: right and it's and it's a little more it's like you know that's affecting something that you do every day which is answering your mail you know and and opening your mail and you know and it's something that could affect anyone 

430.14 432.33 B: yeah that's terror that's terror 

430.24 436.42 A: whereas like the trade center thing definitely you know while while everybody was scared afterwards 

436.30 446.41 A: there was that feeling of like well you know i i'm sure like if i lived in a small town somewhere i probably wouldn't be as scared as if i worked in a skyscraper 'cause then it'd be like oh my god it happened before 

442.25 443.06 B: huh 

443.14 452.60 B: yeah trust me in boise trust me in boise i'm not f- i'm not i'm not afraid [laughter] i mean i they're not gonna come get me in boise idaho man 

448.25 451.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

451.17 464.48 A: [laughter] it's definitely probably you know not as immediate you know but i and that's a good question i mean do do are pe- do you think people there are scared of like something happening there or is it more like it's gonna happen somewhere else and we're just angry about it 

455.13 455.96 B: huh 

462.03 473.73 B: i don't no i think most people totally feel that way that's it's gonna if it happens it happens somewhere else i mean the day of september eleventh on september eleventh a lot of people kept their kids home or brought their 

468.35 470.11 A: right 

473.55 481.28 B: from school or brought their kids s- s- some of the kids had already gone to school when people found out and so they went and picked their kids up and brought 'em home that day 

481.22 483.09 A: right 

481.47 484.62 B: um but i'd say beyond that first day 

484.90 492.79 B: you know people were pretty much beyond a lotta security at the airport i think s- things stayed about the same you know well i guess 

492.65 496.56 B: w- boise is a state capital of idaho and and there're 

496.49 510.12 B: roads that go around the state capital and they closed all the roads off and put up barriers and stuff like that but really beyond that i mean there really wasn't any difference i mean it we did- d- didn't notice anything different i didn't feel any different 

505.19 507.53 A: (( it didn't it right )) 

510.60 511.64 B: so 

510.66 512.06 A: right 

512.47 514.84 A: (( hm inter- interesting i mean )) 

514.19 516.69 B: what about in l. a. i mean did you i mean 

515.76 516.79 A: um 

516.77 519.08 B: sure at the airports and stuff and 

518.37 526.33 A: yeah at the airports it definitely did um you know and there was a feeling of like 'cause 'cause back in in two thousand they stopped 

526.28 540.93 A: there was a plot to blow up l. a. x. the l. a. airport um i don't know if you if you remember this but there was a guy who was stopped at the border of canada like driving a truck that was full of explosives and that was that was like in early 

532.59 534.37 B: (( i didn't i don't remember that )) 

536.91 539.38 B: oh yeah oh yeah i remember that 

539.50 541.37 B: oh he was headed to l. a. x. 

540.96 555.66 A: he was ser- yeah that was their whole it was the millennium plot and they were gonna blow up l. a. x. and that was like the in in retro- at the time everyone was like oh well that's great you know we've stopped somebody blah blah blah but nobody really thought that much i remember hearing about it and thinking oh well yeah that would never really happen 

555.54 564.16 A: you know they would stop him but that was because it was before nine eleven and after nine eleven everybody was like oh you know oh my god we we came so close before 

563.78 564.54 B: mhm 

564.13 576.28 A: and just barely like they stopped the guy at the border because they were actually gonna let him through and they s- they ended up stopping him and inspecting his truck they decided to inspect him because we was like acting so nervous 

576.34 577.56 A: um 

577.47 582.22 A: that they ended up thinking like hey something's going on and they inspected the truck whereas 

579.05 581.17 B: (( mm yeah )) 

582.11 596.79 A: you know they they wouldn't now it'd be a whole different story because we're so you know used to the idea of really clamping down on the borders and that sorta thing but anyway so l you know l. a. post nine eleven was definitely people were kind of like whoa you know 

596.61 599.88 A: it almost happened to us it happened in new york but at the same time
