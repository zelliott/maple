73.80 75.67 A: it then the 

75.88 78.33 A: they're gonna to have other people are gonna have to 

78.45 86.37 A: get in and try to calm the people which is gonna take much more time while the terrorists might be trained to do another plan you know 

86.01 94.94 B: yeah i agree like you know like if you're like in a building you know and like all of a sudden it blows up you know you've got everybody starts screaming and running you've gotta like tell everybody to calm down you know 

94.85 102.34 B: and find the exit you know get out as soon as possible but if everybody's all screaming and running you know somebody's gonna get hurt someone's gonna get trampled or whatever you know

104.31 105.59 A: yeah 

104.44 105.63 B: (( you've gotta ))

122.40 126.68 A: it was like a bomb or something yeah that's an example an example where 

126.88 128.38 A: everybody panicked and they 

128.64 136.82 A: they should just get outta the school and let the investigators try try to find out who did that and you know 

137.21 141.32 B: yeah and then i think they said that they're gonna still continue the uh graduation 

141.57 144.37 A: (( oh yeah let it continue )) 

144.38 146.22 A: yeah they should they should you know 

145.83 147.46 B: instead have it on monday 

147.65 152.88 A: (( they should do that 'cause otherwise it's like letting the letting the terrorist control our life )) 

152.88 157.69 B: yeah what was it was it a suicide bomber or was it someone that planted a bomb 

153.00 154.06 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

157.95 159.53 A: yeah it was a bomb 

159.83 161.13 B: (( oh okay )) 

159.90 171.95 A: yeah someone that just put a bomb there in in one of the rooms i think yeah that's what i heard [sigh] so for example around here like a couple uh blocks away from my house they found like um 

172.98 177.02 A: they found a terrorist sort of terrorist suitcase 

177.08 178.01 B: oh they did 

177.86 184.01 A: yeah they did and everybody started to panic you know it wasn't it it probably wasn't even it was in a suitcase 

184.49 188.02 A: (( but they they panicked and they )) 

188.50 190.16 A: they run away from the scene 

190.40 191.25 B: uh-huh 

190.49 192.66 A: and that's what causes 

193.26 194.87 A: (( everybody just panicked )) 

195.82 197.66 B: well where where are you from 

198.08 202.01 A: you mean what country well

206.68 209.72 B: oh you live in california and they found a terrorist suitcase over there 

209.27 213.29 A: yeah right here yeah it's probably like ten minutes away away from my house 

213.61 218.04 B: oh wow so did they call the cops and the cops came and checked it out 

217.44 218.79 A: yeah 

218.48 220.71 B: so was there a bomb inside 

220.31 222.22 A: no nothing was in there 

221.86 225.71 B: nothing was in there so it was just a suitcase sitting on the street 

222.74 223.50 A: (( no )) 

225.09 228.19 A: yeah yeah but like the people panicked 

226.70 227.53 B: oh 

228.23 243.14 A: with what happened they other people tried to [cough] leave the scene and that's kinda dumb you know because of trying to find out or throwing the cover away they left it there and like an hour later that was like when they called the cops 

239.02 239.86 B: uh-huh 

243.39 244.36 A: so 

243.42 246.10 B: well what part what part of california are you from 

246.34 247.45 A: (( um )) 

247.99 250.11 A: right here in 

250.32 252.25 A: (( san fernando valley )) 

252.07 252.93 B: where 

252.82 254.03 A: san fernando 

254.03 255.35 B: (( oh san fernando )) 

255.18 256.65 A: yeah 

256.05 259.78 B: oh see 'cause i'm from texas and like so far like nothing has
