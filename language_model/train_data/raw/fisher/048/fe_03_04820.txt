147.53 158.98 A: that's right you never know you know that they they that that side could be a sneak attack they hit somewhere where you don't don't think they will hit you know so you've got to be careful all over the united states actually you know 

154.07 155.42 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

158.92 165.11 B: and i know a a lot of the tourism and stuff that really cut down i think the poor airlines and everything after 

165.51 178.90 B: it happened i don't think as many people are traveling and people just don't have money to travel and um i think in florida even like bush not bush gardens but cypress gardens are shutting down after all these years 'cause they said after the september eleven 

169.56 171.47 A: mhm 

178.83 181.29 B: terrorist attack people just aren't 

179.65 184.82 A: they went yeah they went bankrupt actually mhm mhm 

181.48 183.06 B: yeah right 

183.47 184.27 B: (( well )) 

184.51 187.26 B: it really did have a big affect on our economy 

185.25 186.11 A: (( yeah )) 

186.83 198.82 A: it did you know and everybody not just new york neither all over and you know because it's taken away from what they're actually doing is taking it away from other states too a little percentage to to add to new york city you know 

198.48 199.69 B: mhm 

198.87 200.55 A: and that's bad you know 

203.25 204.90 B: oh yeah they don't 

206.05 208.87 B: really realize i guess what they did to the economy 

208.42 210.47 A: (( mhm )) 

210.14 211.17 B: mhm 

211.31 218.19 B: i know we don't probably go any places and the only things we buy is kind of necessities and stuff 'cause we just never know with 

218.36 220.94 B: unemployment and things like that what's gonna happen 

220.04 225.41 A: exactly it's well yeah exactly and over here the unemployment rate is getting higher and higher 

225.75 231.05 A: you know and they claim there is more jobs but it's really not you know they just want it to look that way 

229.02 229.83 B: no 

230.97 233.39 B: right so everybody doesn't panic in the 

231.16 232.07 A: you know 

232.82 242.87 A: right right and you basically you know if you've got a job you're holding your job you you're scared to try to find something else because if you lose the job you do have you're not guaranteed to get the next job 

233.85 234.86 B: u._s. 

242.59 243.58 B: right 

242.84 252.69 A: so you know what you've gotta do is actually go for interviews and keep your job until you know for sure that you've got the other job coming and then you don't know how long that job might last you know 

251.23 255.35 B: mhm and insurance the health care everybody's got have a 

253.12 263.84 A: mm mhm exactly 'cause a lot of jobs don't have the proper health care so you know if you you got a good um job that has a good health plan you gotta stay with that because 

263.98 267.35 A: a lot of jobs don't give you covers like that on medical coverage 

267.09 269.46 B: and most employers now you have to pay for 

269.11 270.55 A: (( well uh-huh )) 

269.64 271.16 B: medical covers 

270.70 280.86 A: and medication and everything and that doesn't make sense 'cause medication is a arm and a leg and and a visit to the doctor forget it the what they charge nowadays is ridiculous 

272.33 273.46 B: mhm 

280.97 282.01 A: you know 

281.03 283.80 B: it is i can't believe the cost 

283.30 288.34 A: mhm just to get your heart checked and and you know minor stuff you know 

287.67 288.72 B: mhm 

288.44 295.46 A: like i have asthma and my daughters have asthma so everytime they go to hospital they have to use the asthma machine and stuff like that that costs money 

294.60 302.63 B: mhm my husband he had his gall bladder out and we got this huge bill it was like twenty four hundred dollars of just medications he had in outpatients and 

297.34 298.22 A: uh-huh 

302.26 303.20 A: uh-huh 

302.71 308.29 B: i asked for an itemized bill and it turned up out there was seven hundred dollars extra medication they charge me for that he never got 

307.89 310.66 A: oh wow [noise] 

309.06 310.96 B: so he almost paid bill 

310.69 311.69 A: uh-huh 

310.98 312.02 B: good thing i 

312.26 321.59 B: question it 'cause i'm a stay at home mom with two kids and i thought well i'm just gonna see whatever he had it must have been some good stuff so i'd better find out [laughter] 

319.64 324.74 A: [laughter] for all that money that's right they didn't wanna give you the rest huh 

323.08 323.65 B: (( no )) 

324.28 327.11 B: [laughter] 

324.81 326.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

326.91 328.11 A: oh boy 

327.42 331.14 B: so yeah yeah look over always the bills and everything 'cause 

331.10 332.82 A: (( mhm )) 

331.74 335.22 B: (( i know what he's like i would probably i guess pay it in kinda a )) 

335.16 337.24 A: (( yeah )) 

335.65 341.36 B: terrorist attack but it's had not to how severe the other ones have been and all the biological 

342.09 345.52 B: stuff that's around now the anthrax and things like that 

344.78 345.78 A: yeah 

347.33 352.45 B: never really hurt us that kind of stuff before and now it's a whole new world it seems like 

349.15 351.96 A: (( yeah )) 

352.44 353.42 A: uh-huh 

353.67 366.02 A: yeah and that's that's something too because a- actually if if they were to try to just send that to everybody you know how many people would be affected by that you know because they they don't they they got big plots they plot that way you know 

360.82 361.74 B: mhm 

365.82 374.47 A: [noise] so um to trying to hurt you know as many people they can in one shot so i wouldn't be surprised that would try to do something like that just 

372.98 376.12 B: and even in new york like in the subway or something like that or 

374.92 377.60 A: uh-huh mhm 

376.15 378.87 B: bottles or chemicals and 

378.63 382.34 A: [noise] and that's why right now we've got our national guards in the subway and everything 

381.73 384.29 B: really wow that's good 

382.27 395.24 A: yeah because they that's what our reason they're looking for like the you know briefcases left bags and you know it's a check you know because they that's how they do it they'll leave it there and just keep moving and it will blow up or whatever you know 

395.17 399.00 B: [noise] wow i didn't realize there was national guard in the subways that's good though 

398.23 411.72 A: yeah they they as a matter of fact they had almost not every subway but like the major subway like transfer subways and where you could transfer to another train or a bus and all stations like that and they're riding up and down on the trains too 

411.65 413.04 B: (( [noise] wow )) 

412.45 416.04 A: 'cause they gotta patrol you know they they can't take no chances [noise] 

415.18 420.09 B: and then i think still don't they have the air marshalls too i thin on the flights or something like that 

419.08 423.98 A: yeah mhm exactly on the flights and everything at la guardia airport kennedy 

424.78 425.82 B: wow 

426.16 431.78 B: and all that stuff too costs a lot of money for the taxpayers but they gotta have the tighter security you know 

428.78 430.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

431.53 432.43 A: (( mhm )) 

432.05 434.61 B: and that's cut into the deficit and everything 

434.53 435.46 A: (( mhm )) 

437.75 438.44 B: (( mm )) 

442.75 446.02 B: what else could we say [laughter] 

444.50 446.41 A: [laughter] 

446.74 454.90 B: that they gave us it's kind of generic they didn't give us really a lot of details i wasn't sure what our topic was gonna be i never this before so i wasn't sure how 

452.47 453.70 A: (( uh-huh )) 

454.82 457.54 A: nah me neither this is my first time 

455.70 456.61 B: they give you 

456.99 460.42 B: i guess we can do up to three calls or something it said 

459.41 461.91 A: yeah three three of them yeah 

461.06 464.32 B: i don't know if they have to be different days or however 

463.04 467.21 A: n- i i think different day- i think one every day i believe i'm not sure 

468.32 472.98 B: i guess the computer just calls us or i think you can call in i'm not sure how 

472.20 475.81 A: yeah that's what i did i called in mhm 

473.73 474.94 B: oh you did 

475.19 476.76 B: it called me for 

477.99 481.10 B: and then i just punched in my code and then it 

480.45 484.76 A: yeah that's what i did i punched in my code and i just called in 

481.76 482.88 B: (( connected i )) 

484.44 487.25 B: guess it's i think that they're a grant through the government 

486.90 488.74 A: yeah it is 

489.00 490.99 B: it's nice i didn't realize that 

492.20 497.79 B: well it's an easy way to get hooked up and you get to talk to somebody from the other side of the states so 

496.15 502.22 A: mhm and get to see how people living somewhere else and you know it it's interesting 

499.29 500.54 B: yeah 

501.59 507.99 B: so it was perfect too to get the new york topic 'cause right when you're from new york and [laughter] 

504.76 509.27 A: [laughter] i know a lot of people are gonna say you might be at worse end 

508.98 510.55 B: [laughter] 

511.45 516.29 B: so you're are you right in the city part of it then or are you kind of out in the country a little bit 

515.54 518.21 A: m- i'm like in the in the suburb part of it 

517.60 518.95 B: the suburb okay 

518.38 520.28 A: mhm 

520.58 524.71 B: so you're still where you are too vulnerable for a terrorist attack 

524.22 528.33 A: exactly i'm i'm not no afraid just 'cause i'm away from it 

527.77 529.30 B: now did you fear 

529.92 533.87 B: feel fearful after the september eleven attack since you were so close to it 

533.57 536.76 A: yeah [noise] uh you know sometime i just like 

536.89 551.35 A: i'm always like wondering you know just i'm scared to down to the like the manhattan part city where like the empire state building and all that's at i used to go down there all the time i'm scared to go down there because that's that's more than likely where they're gonna attack at you know 

544.42 545.53 B: mhm 

547.11 547.70 B: (( mm )) 

551.03 552.32 B: mm that's true 

551.46 555.09 A: and it could happen any time you never know when it's gonna happen [noise] 

556.84 558.58 B: that's true 'cause uh it 

559.42 563.58 B: seems like they would i'm sure they'll do something again it's just really scary 

562.95 565.65 A: mhm 

566.30 567.48 B: mhm 

567.89 572.51 B: now uh after the september eleven attack did you have to run out to the store and did you like start 

572.97 574.54 B: squirreling stuff away 

573.47 579.58 A: right mhm they told everybody to do that mhm 

574.94 576.51 B: mhm 

577.05 578.48 B: (( they did oh )) 

579.82 592.65 A: because we didn't really know what was the outcome gonna be but it wasn't as well it was bad 'cause a lot of people got killed and stuff like that but it wasn't as bad as they thought it was gonna be 'cause they thought there was gonna be more attacks after that so thank god it wasn't you know 

592.28 593.19 B: mhm 

592.61 599.90 A: but that was just enough itself so many just kids and babies 'cause they go nurseries and stuff in there and you know a lot of babies died and stuff like that
