0.71 2.22 B: this is alan 

1.33 3.20 A: [noise] hello 

2.81 3.84 B: hello 

3.68 5.05 A: hi i'm ted 

4.62 6.33 B: hi ted this alan 

6.20 7.17 A: alan 

6.73 8.08 B: alan yes 

7.58 17.97 A: yeah well this is an interesting subject i think i have a friend though that watches court t._v. all the time and he has this negative attitude towards life he thinks everybody's out to get him 

18.21 22.98 B: well as the old joke goes just because you're paranoid doesn't mean the world isn't out to get you 

22.38 26.48 A: [laughter] yeah that's one of my favorite lines 

24.31 32.81 B: [cough] but but yeah the ah my my own personal feeling is ah you know where high profile trials are concerned um 

32.97 46.92 B: i i have no problem with them being televised after the fact but during it i think ah causes tremendous ah influence of the press and ah [mn] pressure for the participants 

37.25 38.29 A: yeah 

45.27 46.24 A: well you know 

46.56 49.42 A: i just had jury duty and if you had a 

48.23 50.73 B: (( mhm )) 

49.81 50.48 A: (( ah ah )) 

50.49 58.03 A: some problem with the trial and they had to retry it after it's televised you would have a hard time finding a an impartial jury 

57.87 62.92 B: mhm oh i i tend to agree i mean okay the classic example being o. j. simpson 

62.52 63.78 A: right 

63.36 72.28 B: you know now to this day i'm exceptionally proud of the fact that i still don't remember and i never knew the names of the people he is he was accused of murdering 

72.56 76.03 B: ah [laughter] which tells you just how little i paid attention to it 

76.09 86.10 B: i mean as soon as something came on the news about it i would change channels and then of course that wouldn't be would be showing the same stuff going on [laughter] in the trial today but ah 

85.20 86.30 A: (( ah yeah )) 

86.07 93.63 B: i i just i i don't really think that you know live high profile stuff is a is necessary or necessarily healthy for a culture 

93.96 101.01 B: fine let's look at it from a historical perspective but i don't think we need to know exactly what's going on second per second 

100.00 101.27 A: yeah 

101.71 106.51 B: [mn] ah i'll tell you okay i'm not a high profile person but if i were 

107.18 117.75 B: you know ah had to be in a court trial i sure as hell wouldn't wanna be h- have every word every action every look on my face broadcast to millions of homes the second i made them 

116.37 124.46 A: yeah well you know it's similar to the thing about ah something gets front page coverage and the apology gets stuck on page nine 

124.21 128.87 B: mhm well it's sensationalistic journalism 

128.26 129.56 A: yeah 

129.04 132.78 B: and unfortunately it sells papers which is hm 

131.34 140.59 A: well i was interviewed once for a fire i was ah helping to run a folk club folk music club and it wasn't very liked by the community and this was an old v._f._w. 

138.36 148.56 B: (( mhm )) 

140.59 150.89 A: ah wooden building on an island in the town near the river and ah somebody came and torched it one night and the guy who interviewed me from the philadelphia inquirer 

151.01 163.98 A: asked me a lot of questions and ah we were talking and i said something about ah well you know my grandfather and my parents didn't really want me messing around here but ah you know i was involved in the club and now i'm not sure what i'm gonna do with my life i'll have to look for another job 

164.23 169.82 A: and they printed it with like a front page thing guys life is destroyed 

169.37 171.96 B: [laughter] 

170.44 173.71 A: and then my parents got mad my grandfather wouldn't speak to me 

174.19 176.95 A: and you know it was completely exaggerated 

174.57 181.65 B: and he he's basically said he basically said that ah you were blaming them for destroying your life oh jeeze 

179.45 180.62 A: right 

180.67 187.09 A: and i didn't say that i said in passing i guess i'll have to look for another job i'm not sure what i wanna do with my life i'm only twenty four you know 

181.71 182.70 B: (( no )) 

185.70 187.42 B: mhm 

187.49 189.40 A: [laughter] that's all i meant 

187.99 199.60 B: [laughter] yeah the um you know i mean okay i w- i was briefly quoted in the washington post last year and they they they very simply misquoted who you know the company for whom i work 

199.93 212.17 B: and my boss was very upset because she thought that i was like trying to mislead who i work for [laughter] and it was for just something it was two missing words from the company's title [sigh] ah anyway 

204.28 205.61 A: yeah 

205.73 206.62 A: and it 

210.86 214.88 A: well see this makes you look at other news reports then with some skepticism 

214.33 217.12 B: oh d- with tremendous skepticism um 

216.08 220.19 A: you know now you know how it works and now you know that it's not always what it seems 

220.20 233.76 B: well i i personally think we do have something of a liberal press in ah in in the united states at the moment and don't don't get me wrong it's a free press but it that also shows that ah that that that newspapers can control the spin 

233.82 248.02 B: on which they print a a story um okay again classic classic joke here um which kind of ah illustrates my point the um the um ah united states and russia have a foot race 

235.31 236.21 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

248.28 255.40 B: and they're the only two competing and the united states wins and russia ah is ah doesn't okay 

255.61 260.70 B: so one newspaper's um who's pro american says you know um 

260.55 270.98 B: americans win race russians lose whereas a pro russian newspaper says um russians in second place americans next to last 

271.35 276.82 B: so if it's where they're reporting the exact same events but they're putting a spin on it to make you 

274.39 275.52 A: yeah 

277.00 279.88 B: think about it differently and i think that's what ah 

280.41 288.10 B: [sigh] i think that's what news does with ah televising trials i because they don't necessarily have to show every single scene 

288.17 289.28 A: yeah 

288.21 290.11 B: they can put it together 

290.14 301.22 B: the way they want to make it seem more sensational they'll show you twenty minutes of highlights of what was and it was sort of wow look at all this stuff that happened today but they don't tell you that it was spread across nine hours in the courtroom 

301.01 310.18 A: right ah one of the jury trials i was on a coup- couple of years ago i was a federal juror in philadelphia and ah it was a case where a parolee had a gun 

310.13 322.14 A: it they had a crepe game going and the police came and broke it up and then they started the crepe game again and then the police came back and said if you don't break it up we're gonna arrest everybody and they still kept it going they came back chased this guy down the street 

322.01 329.95 A: and he threw the gun over his shoulder as he got tackled and here if he's parolee if he's caught with a gun he goes back to jail for the rest of his term 

328.61 329.47 B: uh-huh 

330.09 340.60 A: so the court had to prove that this was a working pistol and they spent over an hour describing the mechanism of the of the gun 

341.03 343.19 A: and that really surprised me 

344.25 349.12 B: [noise] there there okay maybe that's an excessive example of burden of proof [laughter] 

347.89 349.65 A: but that's what they do 

349.17 350.21 B: (( but ah )) 

349.71 359.60 A: and say for instance it's something more complicated they're gonna spend a couple of days describing stuff like that before they even get to the meat and potatoes of why they're there 

358.39 368.76 B: mhm i'd say it sounds like the o. j. simpson gloves thing i mean the gloves don't fit him well you know maybe he was wearing gloves that were a little too tight for him when he killed her you know 

362.03 363.18 A: yeah 

368.89 377.95 B: [laughter] but they don't ever mention that they just say they don't fit um i mean they how long how many weeks did they spend on the gloves 

378.11 380.36 A: [mn] i don't remember i wasn't watching it either 

378.80 379.65 B: hey 

379.91 386.32 B: and it was it was a it was a waste of time it was a waste of resources because they were never going to get a definitive answer on that one 

386.64 395.99 B: okay fine so the gloves were a little snug well i've worn gloves that were too snug that doesn't prove that i w- i was wearing them at the time something happened it doesn't prove i didn't 

396.50 398.16 B: [sigh] 

397.10 403.21 A: yeah why is all the footage of his son running up to the car and it occurred to me that maybe his son did it 

403.38 404.83 B: (( so um )) 

404.05 411.48 A: and that he was hiding the fact because o. j. worked in that yard all the time he knew where the air conditioner was he wasn't gonna bump into his own air conditioner 

406.16 409.22 B: ah yeah c- covering his mhm 

411.77 413.12 B: see 

411.88 414.90 A: that was a person that didn't know what was behind that wall 

414.98 419.63 B: see i didn't know anything about that so i guess i did- didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it 

419.46 431.64 B: um you know i'll i'll i'll look for the verdict but i i as i said i just don't care about every single minute of every single trial of of someone big 

431.41 440.05 B: ah winona ryder good example everybody in the world had articles about that okay fine she was shoplifting fine her and send her on her way you know 

433.89 434.83 A: [laughter] 

440.21 444.45 B: [laughter] but it's not headline news as far as i'm concerned 

443.22 444.98 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

444.96 446.24 B: (( [cough] )) 

446.28 454.62 B: don't get me wrong i find her awfully cute [laughter] but ah [laughter] but i really couldn't care less that she went to trial for shoplifting [sigh] yeah 

453.22 457.38 A: [laughter] yeah well that's that's ah you know a famous person they're watching their every move 

457.78 460.48 A: they put this stuff on about the smallest things 

457.97 459.21 B: but ah i know 

460.21 465.32 B: and i really don't think it's necessary to have a cable channel dedicated to this one purpose 

465.09 466.46 A: what to the trials 

466.04 468.03 B: yeah well the c- the court t._v. 

467.78 468.80 A: right 

468.21 472.07 B: if there is a sensational trial it's gonna be on there live you 

472.15 475.53 A: yeah well i don't have a i don't have cable any more yeah 

474.84 475.86 B: (( know ah )) 

476.14 482.46 B: yeah unfortunately there're only about three channels i buy cable for and court t._v. is not one of them [laughter] 

482.95 493.63 B: so but i mean i i guess it's a i i don't really think they should make it available maybe on a limited basis you know say hey let's say to law schools let the students study what really happens in the court system 

493.71 495.57 B: but i don't really think it's home 

495.63 499.69 B: (( entertainment )) 

496.06 500.10 A: well i have a guy here in town who's a an entrepreneur he's always ah 

500.13 505.69 A: trying to come up with new ideas in fact he came up with an idea that was similar to m._t._v. way before m._t._v. came along 

505.90 515.07 A: and he was asking my opinion and i was being sarcastic one day and i said why not w- you know i was commenting on just what you're commenting about i we don't need a channel for everything 

514.70 515.29 B: (( mhm )) 

515.21 525.32 A: and ah we were talking about one channel that would have nothing but a a burning fire in a fireplace and you would turn that on instead of lighting your own fireplace and we're joking about it now there is one 

516.85 519.40 B: (( yeah )) 

525.52 527.58 A: there's actually a channel like that 

525.85 535.77 B: [laughter] oh i know i i've heard about that w- one of my favorite parodies along those lines was ah it showed this guy for like thirty seconds who was making faces and making gibbering noises 

528.12 528.92 A: [laughter] 

535.55 536.81 A: [laughter] 

535.76 550.06 B: and bouncing up and down and looking really cute and then he pulled back and you saw this infant staring at the screen and they just said the baby channel [laughter] so it was just a person a- sorry 

538.31 539.21 A: uh-huh 

544.95 546.09 A: wow 

547.08 549.31 A: that's for people without children i guess 

549.64 551.65 A: people without children of their own 

551.38 557.73 B: [laughter] i suppose but you know this was something you know making faces and funny noises and so forth to entertain kids 

557.83 560.72 B: and sometimes that's what i think most of t- what television is [laughter] 

560.53 571.71 A: oh well the thing i suggest to this guy was the death channel and i said what you would show is ah you know the what's his name from world war one when he gets shot in the head and the kennedy's films 

571.31 572.29 B: uh-huh 

571.68 576.65 A: and films from d. day and war and stuff and it would just be constant death 

574.26 578.71 B: famous assassinations and death procedures and capital punishment 

577.89 584.82 A: right it would be all that stuff you know any any footage they have of actual death and he thought i was serious 

582.07 583.47 B: yeah 

584.83 586.10 B: [laughter] 

584.92 587.09 A: he said that's a great idea 

586.46 592.32 B: you wanna know something that's scary enough but w- i'll bet you within ten twenty years someone will offer something like that 

591.18 592.51 A: yeah 

592.36 593.51 B: [sigh] 

592.92 599.08 A: it's it it's ah you know the horror fascination kind of a thing full channel dedicated to that oh my god 

593.53 594.51 B: (( it's ah )) 

595.98 597.28 B: mhm i mean 

597.69 599.89 B: well how many people have ever thought that there would be like
