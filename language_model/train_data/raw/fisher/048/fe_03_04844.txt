0.41 2.43 B: hi i'm harvier 

2.22 3.80 A: hi i'm mark 

3.54 4.67 B: hi mark 

4.21 5.19 A: how are you 

4.94 6.90 B: good 

7.24 10.36 B: okay um so any ideas 

10.55 11.46 A: (( huh )) 

11.24 13.64 B: any ideas on terrorism um 

12.72 15.55 A: ah oh how i would react to terrorist attack 

15.12 16.83 B: right 

15.70 18.54 A: um well it would depend on the type of attack [laughter] ah 

18.35 21.47 B: [laughter] yeah i i agree and where i was 

20.64 26.55 A: yeah [laughter] if it was you know was it like nine eleven was more just you know ah 

21.85 22.83 B: um 

26.97 31.61 A: i don't know it ended up being just an odd day that i didn't know how to react 

31.39 34.34 B: were you anywhere near um manhattan 

34.01 36.41 A: no no i i actually was in atlanta so 

36.14 41.89 B: okay i i was it it's interesting because um i'm from new york and happened to be there um 

41.50 42.74 A: really [cough] 

42.38 43.99 B: yeah i was um 

44.17 51.93 B: interestingly i was ah on my way to the airport in newark new jersey to return a rental vehicle 

51.71 60.15 B: and was driving through a part of manhattan that i don't normally go which is downtown towards the harlem tunnel which is about i'd say something maybe like ah 

60.94 72.44 B: seven blocks away from the world trade center um and it was eight something a._m. um and i happened to be passing in a large intersection looking up to see what was going on um 

72.65 75.20 B: otherwise i wouldn't have been there ah 

75.09 84.57 B: and it was strange at first i didn't have any idea what was happening i thought it was an accident that some personal airplane someone's personal jet 

84.37 97.64 B: or right small propeller plane had you know mistakenly veered into the building and it wasn't until i made some phone calls and turned the radio on in the car that i realised what was actually go- i mean it actually took a while for people to really realise what was happening 

97.86 105.84 B: um and i have to say judging by what i saw most people didn't seem panic stricken i think because of the time i don't re- 

106.20 111.90 B: i don't think we really realised what the extent of the strategy was 

108.94 109.82 A: yeah 

111.38 120.86 A: yeah i have to say when i left for work that morning i'd heard that a plane had hit the world trade center and in my brain i pictured a small aircraft like a small light plane 

116.19 117.00 B: (( [cough] )) 

120.53 121.85 B: right 

120.74 135.51 A: you know i didn't see any images so but then i got to work and my wife called me and she was like you're not going to believe this and you know she's sort of sending me pictures um she was taking from on the t._v. and it was just ah i mean it was just unreal and eventually someone turn on t._v. at work 

130.23 132.17 B: mhm 

135.51 137.62 A: and we ended up watching it 

136.83 138.95 B: right i mean 

137.66 138.61 A: (( it was unreal )) 

139.07 150.47 B: like i said judging from what was going on that day it doesn't seem that most people panicked um but i think that pretty much because of that day there's a different mindset right now 

141.18 141.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

143.23 144.19 A: (( yeah i know )) 

150.24 159.67 B: and um like you pointed out earlier i think it depends on what kind of incident provokes the ang- or you know the the fear in people i mean i i 

154.93 155.72 A: yeah 

158.67 168.62 A: yeah well i think like if it was a an explosion or you know a bomb those kind of things happen and then they're over and people you know pick up the pieces and move on 

168.33 169.38 B: right 

168.72 173.54 A: but if it i think the big fear for everyone is like a chemical or a biological attack 

173.36 175.27 B: right 

173.56 180.21 A: 'cause then it's one of those things you find out about you know days later people start dying and you don't know why 

178.64 185.12 B: mhm right exactly the the the first the the bomb or the explosion that sort of 

180.35 181.67 A: (( a- you know [mn] )) 

185.08 196.15 B: propels you into immediate reaction so you have to get out or you have to run or you have to deal on some level um whereas with something like chemical or mass terrorism 

187.34 188.22 A: right 

196.41 203.95 B: it's stealthier so you don't really know what to do to avoid it or how to make the situation better you kind of have to live in the shadow of this 

203.48 204.85 A: yeah exactly 

203.86 213.42 B: which is yeah a much more offensive i guess form of in- inflicting fear on people um 

211.72 221.92 A: oh yeah well i mean you look at the sars i mean we didn't see too much of that here but [mn] you know everybody in hong kong was wearing masks and i mean can you imagine if something like that happened here 

219.50 221.23 B: right 

221.94 225.87 A: i mean it you know i think it would be a much there'd be a lot more panic 

226.34 228.18 A: in a situation like that [mn] 

227.55 228.57 B: (( [cough] excuse )) 

229.62 233.88 B: me i agree how do you think your react you'd react personally 

232.68 233.79 A: um 

235.28 239.46 A: well like i said it would depend on the attack if it was chemical or biological and it was in my 

235.51 236.34 B: um 

239.60 241.00 A: city 

241.03 242.12 A: um 

242.31 244.02 A: ah i'd leave [laughter] 

243.74 244.89 B: right 

244.04 248.57 A: i'd get in my car and i would leave i'd drive as far away as i could until i knew it was safe to go back 

248.82 249.79 B: right 

248.93 250.34 A: um 

250.44 260.05 B: any any feeling of that now where you think that people perhaps in atlanta are maybe inter- more interested in living outside of the city 

260.71 272.94 B: i know in new york for example a couple of my friends have demonstrated a willingness to move out if the right opportunity comes along which for someone who's some you know managed to establish themselves in in new york 

260.90 261.55 A: (( [cough] ah )) 

268.40 269.20 A: (( oh yeah )) 

272.73 286.23 B: um isn't an easy thing to do at a certain point in your life ah if you've got family the idea of moving out of the city and um i have friends who's parents in in their sixties are now um moving to santa fe 

276.17 277.10 A: really [cough] 

286.12 293.38 B: um and my friend herself with her child and her husband are moving out to new jersey not entirely because of the fear but 

293.15 306.84 B: i think it's fueled the kind of feeling that well you know i don't feel like i'm missing much right now in this episode of manhattan's history um i could be somewhere else and and derive some pleasure 

306.23 318.66 A: yeah well i have to say i'm thirty three and i now have three kids um when i was in my late twenties i lived in the city and i loved it but then i got married and you know we started having children and and we live 

310.08 311.81 B: mhm 

314.42 315.29 B: mhm 

318.67 326.91 A: we live about twenty five minutes from downtown and i have to say atlanta's pretty spread out in terms of being a city there there's a lot of people that live [cough] in town 

321.34 322.20 B: (( [cough] )) 

326.60 327.64 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

327.13 331.14 A: but for the most part everybody lives around the city somewhere so 

331.21 340.12 A: it it would be interesting if there was some kind of attack in the city how it would affect the people i think a lot of people on the outskirts of atlanta feel pretty um insulated 

336.24 337.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

340.60 345.38 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i guess it makes a big difference what kind of city you're in um 

341.21 341.85 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

343.11 345.57 A: (( mm )) 

345.74 355.52 B: yeah i'm i'm now in philadelphia as a matter of fact um not not for any terrorist related reason um and i feel somewhat more 

355.64 363.23 B: out of the loop here i don't see philadelphia as a target of any sort um 

363.20 368.31 B: and i don't i don't know what people here would do i think most people here feel the same way 

368.12 382.85 B: so it's not really in the back of their heads as it might be with people in new york who may have contacts relatives outside the city or have you know at least at some point in their lives after september eleventh um thought about what they might do 

382.72 392.82 B: um and i think here people kind of feel safe um which is probably the this is the case in all cities except for the exception of maybe four in the whole country 

385.63 386.60 A: yeah 

391.62 397.80 A: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah i i i do i think people especially in the s- like you said the suburbs did you say the suburbs 

397.99 402.75 B: i'm in i'm actually in philadelphia proper yeah 

400.07 407.64 A: [noise] [noise] oh you are [noise] [noise] well um i i do think i think a lot of people in the suburbs feel pretty insulated from that [noise] [noise] kind of attack 

406.09 407.96 B: mhm 

408.16 415.81 A: i really do and i don't [mn] i think i think just because and and i think rightfully so to [noise] [noise] the inner cities are more of a target 

412.88 413.73 B: (( [cough] )) 

415.95 421.81 A: you know i think i think a i don't know i think a lot of people expect the cities to be hit by a bomb or you know 

421.82 423.64 A: that kind of thing so they feel 

424.27 429.38 A: more like they're just waiting for the other shoe to drop as opposed to having an escape route you know [mn] 

428.94 438.75 B: right exactly i think they um the tendency is to think that something similar is going to happen um just because that's what they saw and well 

434.39 435.53 A: mhm 

437.58 452.56 A: yeah and it and it also like i said before my greatest fear is that you know people are just going to start dying and it's going to start to become a a bigger and bigger problem much like sars and you know at some point someone's going to go this is not a virus this is 

443.70 444.80 B: right 

452.44 461.64 A: and it's something that y- you know somebody did and here's the epicenter and and man i think if that happened then you would have a full scale panic 

453.20 453.76 B: (( [cough] )) 

455.12 456.52 B: right 

461.46 466.44 B: right i don't even know to what ex- i mean has that been a discussion in the news um 

466.50 467.99 B: has has someone 

468.11 472.11 B: suggested that this might be a contrived 

472.47 476.01 B: illness and not something that is just 

473.27 482.09 A: ah no no no ah that everything i've heard um says that it's it's very ah that it's a know type of virus that it just mutated and 

481.43 490.50 B: right okay yeah 'cause it's interesting until you said that i hadn't really thought of it in any other way but as a sort of natural evolution of a virus of some sort 

489.27 490.11 A: yeah 

491.06 492.02 B: huh 

492.52 493.96 B: um excuse me i've 

494.03 497.58 B: got allergies [laughter] i have to drink some water 

495.18 499.10 A: oh don't worry i'm i'm i have a cold myself so don't don't feel bad 

499.41 501.11 A: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

500.01 500.84 B: (( [noise] )) 

501.85 506.21 B: what um what was the reaction in atlanta around september 

507.00 508.58 A: um 

507.23 510.71 B: i mean i imagine that's kind of a silly question i imagine it's [laughter] like everywhere 

510.45 515.72 A: ye- yeah well everybody was just stunned and i i'll admit i mean i would just catch myself 

510.80 512.08 B: else [laughter] 

515.74 525.24 A: um tearing up on the way to work and it would just hit me hit me at odd times what happened that that many people died at one time and it would just it was just overwhelming 

519.82 521.66 B: mhm 

522.45 523.53 B: right 

525.11 538.99 A: and that took quite a while to to get over and i think that i i listen to the radio a lot and watch a lot of television programmes and there were a lot of like you know town meetings and people were just wanting to talk about it and you know it it was it was devastating 

536.87 538.54 B: yeah 

539.32 552.55 B: yeah i remember having it having a strange effect days weeks later on people um who seemed to have dealt with it well enough at the beginning um and then much like some sort of echo 

547.23 547.79 A: (( [cough] )) 

552.74 561.30 B: weeks later there was this sort of panic or realization of what had actually happened yeah it was a very strange experience 

558.14 559.26 A: (( yeah i )) 

560.15 569.00 A: have to say one thing i was kind of disappointed is i when it first happened like for the a couple of weeks afterwards everybody was just a little extra nice to each other 

568.31 570.18 B: mhm 

569.18 573.67 A: and i thought wow you know i mean what a horrible thing but man i think people 

573.50 586.25 A: maybe are getting it now that we really are not that safe and we're all you know just relying on each other and you know that the bad thing can happen to anybody at any time and and but you know of course like anything else 

583.16 584.99 B: mhm 

586.03 590.05 A: it that just faded away now everybody's back to you know the way they used to be 

589.70 599.63 B: right which on some level is good because there's an acknowledgement that things are normal but we've lost that sort of that sense of compassion that was nice to see 

592.14 593.39 A: (( yeah right )) 

597.77 599.89 A: (( yeah [noise] yeah it's sad that ))
