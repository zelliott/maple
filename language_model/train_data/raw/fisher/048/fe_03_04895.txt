0.60 1.78 B: hello 

1.68 3.24 A: hi how are you 

3.31 5.20 B: good how are you my name's art 

5.16 7.23 A: my name's david 

6.69 7.90 B: (( david how you doing )) 

7.76 9.34 A: (( all right )) 

9.50 14.75 A: so uh [laughter] televised trials court tv [laughter] 

9.71 10.46 B: so 

14.67 20.09 B: yeah you know [cough] i watched a little bit of the o._j. trial years ago 

20.44 25.89 B: and um i don't know i just i i'm not really interested in it it's uh 

26.15 30.99 B: i don't know i think it's uh i think you could be doing a lot better things with with my time 

31.29 39.61 A: well i i think it's i think it's good to learn be able to learn about the criminal process or or just be able to learn about the judicial process 

40.04 50.89 A: and you know celebrity trials give you a chance to learn about that life i think that's a good thing but i think the the trials should probably be televised maybe 

40.41 41.43 B: yeah 

50.94 53.88 A: after they occur rather than while they're occurring 

53.63 55.39 B: yeah that's a good point 

54.10 56.25 A: so that way that way 

56.27 57.96 A: there's a fair trial 

57.99 58.93 B: yeah 

58.10 66.45 A: but you know i mean on the other hand there's a right for you know a public trial that's part of the constitution to have a public tri- be able to have a public trial 

66.02 71.75 B: yeah well i mean you can uh you know you can go to your local court house any time 

71.81 73.86 B: and sit in on trials 

73.21 79.48 A: yeah but everybody works and you know if they don't see it on t._v. man come home after work you can watch it 

79.32 81.15 B: yeah that that's 

79.87 84.89 A: but you know if if you have to go to the court house it not very many people go watch 

84.83 97.26 B: that's true that's true but i i mean i think unfortunately even though you know your your point is somewhat you know has a certain amount of validity people who watch trials on t._v. 

97.17 104.36 B: aren't really watching to learn the judicial process i mean maybe a very few like law students or something like that 

102.85 115.90 A: but at least at least at least they have the opportunity to see that you know i mean i mean some people might just watch it for the sort of details you know but i mean but so what i mean if if they watch the sort of details maybe a little bit of a 

110.12 111.10 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

115.91 128.58 A: of the actual judicial process seeps in i mean i mean a lot of people watch regular t._v. for sort of details i mean i mean i mean their their reason for watching isn't that important 

123.41 125.42 B: yeah well absolutely 

128.25 138.53 B: yeah yeah that's true i just you know i don't know i feel like especially nowadays with everything on t._v. is reality based you know and you've got the peer 

137.62 149.27 A: well the yeah the sort of reality shows though are you know they're not even real that's the problem that people think that they're real but they're just they're o- oversimplifications of complex problems 

138.58 140.14 B: the peer factor 

149.07 155.35 B: yeah yeah i i don't know i think that t._v. in general and and i'm guilty i mean i watch 

155.22 165.56 B: more t._v. probably than i should but i think t._v. i think the people who produce television shows know that that we're not really 

165.73 168.21 B: for the most part a very bright society 

168.30 170.43 B: you know i mean we're kinda getting 

171.27 181.26 B: numbed and you know everything on t._v. now has to be more exciting than whatever was on before you know it's almost like we're becoming desensitized to a certain extent 

181.85 183.12 B: and uh 

183.57 188.50 B: and it's not just television i mean it's you know culture in general but that's 

188.05 191.30 A: well i i think i think i think that t._v. 

191.49 197.52 A: reflects the culture not the other way around i don't think t._v. creates the culture i think t._v. reflects the culture 

195.68 196.44 B: (( [cough] )) 

197.84 199.16 A: and 

197.95 199.78 B: yeah i ag- i agree with you 

199.38 209.98 A: you know and i i i think that you know t._v. should show what people want to see you know i don't think that there should be some german entity that determines like what you should be watching 

210.08 211.28 B: no i agree 

210.19 216.86 A: you know if you don't wanna watch something you just change the channel you know you got two hundred channels so just change it or turn it off 

216.50 230.31 B: yeah no i agree with you i i certainly don't think that we should be told what we can and what we can't watch i just think it's kind of sad that you know what we want to watch as a society is a lot of 

230.67 232.84 B: you know junk 

233.31 240.28 B: you know i mean there's a lot of good shows you know out there and and informative shows and and uh 

240.97 246.66 B: and like i said you know i'm not trying to put myself up on a pedestal i'm i watch as much 

246.77 249.64 B: you know t._v. as as the next person 

250.00 251.82 B: and then i feel you know 

252.30 259.95 B: i i even think sometimes i feel like you know damn i shouldn't be watching so much t._v. there's so many other things i could be doing 

260.35 261.83 B: but i get sucked in 

263.52 265.21 A: yeah well i mean 

265.61 276.19 A: it's well yeah but i mean that's i mean i mean that's a that's kind of a personal [laughter] issue you know i mean no one's holding a gun to your head saying you have to watch it 

272.52 274.27 B: yeah oh yeah 

275.87 282.92 B: oh absolutely not absolutely not it's i you know i that's that's not my point at all my 

276.53 277.71 A: (( you know )) 

282.00 285.34 A: i mean you can also watch you know p._b._s. or you can watch 

285.48 296.95 A: you know there's a lot of i mean you can watch discovery channel and history station you know i mean there are other stations to watch but you know i i think i think court t._v. is kinda cool because 

296.82 305.00 A: you know it it has both elements it has that reality sort of element along with actually a um 

305.73 306.37 B: (( yeah )) 

306.01 309.49 A: along along with an educational element 

308.59 310.98 B: yeah the opportunity to learn something 

310.69 312.75 A: yeah 

311.66 315.28 B: yeah actually you know that's a good point i mean that's something i never really 

315.44 317.53 B: never really thought of before 

317.73 318.97 B: and uh 

318.15 325.47 A: i mean like some of the more interesting trials to watch on t._v. are like like murder trials you know because they're just so dramatic i mean 

325.42 326.54 B: oh yeah 

326.03 329.68 A: i mean you know they they have so much um 

330.23 331.12 A: i mean 

331.57 334.28 A: elements that go into it you know 

334.00 335.02 B: mhm 

334.50 340.09 A: and you know so that's that's i mean i found some of the least 

340.26 346.68 A: um publicized trials are actually more interesting 'cause the human element was more present you know than 

345.88 346.88 B: right 

346.73 349.34 A: than than the o._j. trial you know 

349.08 350.82 B: sure sure 

351.46 358.07 B: yeah i i agree with you because i mean like you say it was you know especially the o._j. trial was was very dramatic 

358.24 365.44 B: you know and yeah and the people who were you know the lawyers in the trials the johnny parkin's and the alan derschwitz's 

365.69 367.21 B: you know they know 

367.58 376.75 B: you know what they need to do and to be dramatic and and uh you know i think they they use that as an opportunity you know to further their own 

372.65 373.44 A: you know 

377.30 379.04 B: you know image 

377.31 382.29 A: and you know and reality tends to be a little bit stranger than fiction [laughter] sometimes 

382.44 384.64 B: yeah it certainly can can't it 

385.37 386.61 B: that's true 

388.90 396.84 A: i mean i think you know i think those kind of trials are infinitely more interesting than watching perry mason you know [laughter] 

395.47 402.63 B: yeah i know because in perry mason the guy always just stands up at the end and cracks right he says i did it i did it 

400.26 401.20 A: right 

403.40 405.71 B: that's true so [laughter] 

405.94 408.45 B: and uh it's you know i was 

408.50 411.96 B: i was actually talking to my wife about this the other day we were watching 

412.08 422.53 B: law and order and um and everything they do on law and order now they say you know it's ripped from the headlines and so they're not really reality t._v. 

422.65 425.91 B: but they're taking stories 

426.01 427.48 B: that are you know 

427.79 429.71 B: that were real stories 

429.76 432.65 B: and writing it into their story lines 

432.82 434.27 B: and it's kind of 

434.44 436.04 B: kind of interesting 

439.85 441.77 A: yeah 

439.95 443.85 B: but that but that of course you know isn't really watching 

443.95 447.78 B: you know a trial or you know what i mean because 

448.45 449.34 B: (( you know )) 

448.45 460.47 A: well watching you know if you're watching a trial i mean watching a trial you know it evolves more more slowly and and it and it and the issues are more complex than what you're gonna see on on law and order 

460.44 462.39 B: yeah oh absolutely 

462.78 464.10 B: absolutely 

465.28 468.90 B: the problem with watching trials is though real trials is 

469.10 476.01 B: they do take a long time to unfold and i mean if you really want to follow it it it's it's a commitment 

472.28 475.12 A: well yeah yeah well 

475.45 478.58 A: yeah but at least you have the opportunity to do it if you want to 

478.52 479.37 B: yeah 

478.73 489.73 A: you know i mean i mean you could and you can also sort of tune in and tune out you know watch this for a little while then and then not watch it you know but but actually you know uh law is 

489.93 503.55 A: you know um the rule of precedent is very much in law so if you have it's inter- it's interesting to know what goes on in the law because that can affect you directly later on you know i mean 

501.26 503.04 B: no that's true mhm 

503.82 508.49 A: so you know it's if you watch if you watch what goes on in court you know 

508.56 517.60 A: those same arguments can be used in other types of court cases and can indirectly affect you you know in your in your every day life 

517.10 519.48 B: sure sure and i mean you know the 

519.54 523.25 B: the things that we see that go on in in court rooms you know 

523.71 534.71 B: you know also and at certain to a certain extent will shape policy you know especially if especially you know nowadays it's kinda like you know everybody 

529.49 531.18 A: right 

534.79 546.84 B: you know wants to legislate everything and everybody sues everybody and and um you know ev- you know every time you know there's a there's a a crime that gets the public you know 

546.85 556.00 B: up in arms you know you see policymakers immediately you know turn around and and try to find a way to legislate it so that they can 

556.75 561.66 B: you know for whatever reason i don't know it could be because they really want 

561.75 568.81 B: to make a law or you know to change a law or make a law or whatever or or it could also be just because that you know 

569.13 573.75 B: politicians tend to jump on the band wagon when when there's public outcry 

574.53 576.21 B: but either way 

576.28 580.63 B: you know law and crime shapes policy 

582.03 587.81 B: and that's just another another way that it's uh we're indirectly affected by 

588.00 589.69 B: that sort of stuff mm 

589.08 590.51 A: that's right 

595.29 599.72 B: that's interesting i have to admit that i hadn't really thought of it as in
