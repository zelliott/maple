10.25 11.01 A: (( mm )) 

11.85 14.19 A: like ah that o. j. simpson trial 

14.07 17.90 B: [noise] yeah yeah that's probably the big one they had in mind when they 

18.25 19.74 B: talked about it 

19.68 23.65 A: so what's the problem um some people want it televised some don't 

25.05 26.74 B: [noise] [noise] i think that um 

27.11 33.15 B: some people are against televising trials because they say it's ah like an invasion of privacy 

32.58 35.15 A: invasion of privacy huh 

35.46 39.23 A: that ain't no invasion of privacy i mean 

39.30 43.15 A: don't they write about all the crimes and stuff you know 

42.52 48.13 B: [mn] [noise] [noise] i think so i think it's just [noise] ah [noise] i mean um i'm [noise] 

44.86 47.53 A: that's not invasion of privacy i mean why shouldn't 

48.51 49.98 B: (( go ahead i )) 

48.90 49.66 A: (( [sigh] who )) 

49.93 59.85 A: the hell is so stupid to call that invasion of privacy i mean if somebody's a killer out there don't you want to see his face so when he gets out of jail you avoid him [laughter] 

53.66 54.75 B: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

59.64 70.21 B: right but i mean i what about the people [mn] that are wrongly accused i mean i don't i'm i'm not a person who believes that i i don't have any problem with televising trials but [noise] 

68.89 75.23 A: wrongly accused come on though that's like one percent or less most of the people who are accused of a crime they did it you know 

76.58 77.44 B: (( [mn] mm )) 

76.84 77.92 A: makes sense 

78.14 84.04 B: i dunno i i i would say there's a lot more than one percent of people that go to trial for things they didn't do 

83.49 91.92 A: okay maybe five ten percent whatever but most of the [noise] people accused are you know guilty [laughter] 

91.73 92.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

92.32 93.95 A: like o. j. [laughter] 

94.16 95.12 B: (( [cough] )) 

95.35 96.83 B: like like o. j. [noise] 

96.66 101.89 A: yeah exactly the only guy who got away with double murder [laughter] 

97.49 98.90 B: (( [noise] no [mn] )) 

102.50 104.22 B: it's ah let's 

104.15 105.42 A: you know what with 

104.37 105.52 B: i i guess 

105.64 106.85 B: (( no go ahead )) 

106.74 108.14 A: (( besides ah )) 

108.40 115.49 A: televised trials they also should have televised ah executions you know [laughter] why not 

114.86 117.78 B: [mn] [mn] ah i dunno i think 

115.76 116.98 A: so people can 

118.60 121.54 B: [mn] i'm not really a big fan of like violence in the media 

121.56 126.71 B: and i think something like that is just going to cause more problems than it would ah alleviate 

127.04 128.73 A: more problems 

128.63 130.00 B: well i think i mean 

129.82 130.89 A: how 

130.20 131.05 B: there's 

131.34 132.50 A: how do you figure 

131.47 139.23 B: americans are americans are bloodthirsty enough as it is i think that you know if you tried to televise trial- or executions 

139.32 146.83 B: you know that's not that's not a matter of you know special effects blood packet i mean the the people are really dying i don't think that ah 

147.02 151.20 A: those are really evil people dying not any kind of people 

149.67 155.08 B: ah but but good or evil you know once once you're used to watching people die 

155.27 166.89 B: you know that's that's a that's not a good thing like wh- when you can just turn on the television and watch someone die and it doesn't bother you it doesn't matter what a person's done i mean watching a person die 

167.49 172.47 B: [mn] that should that should have some sort negative effect on you as a human being [mn] [mn] 

170.60 177.02 A: no not really it has a positive effect on me when i see the m- m- bad guys die 

177.20 180.96 A: make the world a better place [laughter] 

179.96 180.95 B: see but 

181.52 184.00 A: yeah i see what you're saying yeah it 

182.01 186.10 B: i mean they did they did bad things but they're people you know what i mean like 

186.98 194.79 B: and what happens you know have have you never made a a wrong assumption about someone you know you thought they were a bad person and they weren't it's like 

195.12 199.05 B: 'cause then once once it's all right for you to watch bad people die 

199.26 202.26 B: then you you know that's one less step and you can 

202.83 209.72 B: be that much you know treat people that much worse and yeah i i just i think it's a that would be a really bad thing for america 

209.93 212.05 B: to have televised executions [mn] 

211.37 214.91 A: di did you see the movie the life of david gale 

214.85 216.45 B: ah no i didn't [noise] 

216.35 218.01 A: oh man too bad 

218.53 220.12 B: i i mean i i 

220.25 225.71 B: heard that i i listened to a news program about the movie about like what really happens 

225.84 227.00 B: (( and ah )) 

225.95 227.07 A: it's really 

227.43 228.76 B: what's that 

228.18 232.79 A: it's really interesting you know you should if you rent movies you should rent it sometime 

232.27 236.20 B: yeah i i would it's one of the movies that i'd like to see [noise] [mn] 

235.60 247.77 A: i'm telling you it's gonna keep you guessing until the last second it's full of surprises and it's unpredictable and it it's like it's fiction but they fight for a good cause they fight for ah 

247.58 250.65 A: they don't want people to get the death penalty you know 

251.07 256.44 A: you gotta see it i'm not going to say any more but you have to see it it's one of the greatest [noise] 

251.16 252.06 B: right 

253.34 255.24 B: yeah well 

256.61 259.05 B: [mn] i i do need to see it so wh- 

257.71 259.36 A: and it's related 

259.22 262.67 B: do you have you watched televised trials before 

262.88 270.72 A: yeah i mean i don't watch that kinda garbage on tv [laughter] i got better things to watch like t._v. fun stuff you know 

267.23 268.19 B: right 

270.52 272.24 B: [laughter] 

272.59 279.20 B: yeah i i i i suppose i dunno it it's interesting at least see i i don't necessarily agree with the 

273.25 274.15 A: but 

279.33 293.43 B: the the argument that they put up about when they introduced us say about like high profile trials but i think that it it's a valuable thing to have trials on t._v. so that people can understand like how the court system works [mn] 

293.32 297.11 A: [mn] i mean it's so complicated and a lot of times it's boring man 

297.24 308.68 B: yeah it is but i mean you learn a lot i mean 'cause you watch law and order and it makes it look like one thing you know and then you actually if you watch a real trial on t._v. it's way different you know it's it's uh 

297.53 299.23 A: yeah maybe they shouldn't 

307.75 314.10 A: what actually you know what on second thought i change my mind no they shouldn't ah televise this damn trials you know why 

314.03 315.24 B: why [laughter] 

315.15 316.34 A: ah 

316.82 325.86 A: like you said before it's something negative of course yeah we have enough ne- ah negative stuff in our life like the violence on t._v. i mean real life and blah blah blah 

319.51 320.65 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

325.85 326.92 B: (( [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

325.97 332.68 A: why add more negative to the negative but then ah besides that what the hell was it i 

327.46 328.12 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

333.68 338.91 A: i came up with an idea and now i lost it let's see gotta concentrate here 

338.98 343.94 A: what was the reason i don't want to see the damn televised oh i got it it came back to me 

343.56 344.68 B: (( you got it [mn] )) 

344.09 348.96 A: the defence the defence attorneys they make me sick it's like 

349.31 356.29 A: it they enrage me they they're all because of the all kinda crap they come up with to 

355.62 356.85 B: (( mhm )) 

356.36 369.47 A: to defend this low life killers like usually this is what they say that really pisses me off that's why yeah i don't want to see that we already have enough problems i don't want to see another one on t._v. here's what's really bothering me 

359.46 360.39 B: right 

369.94 371.00 A: um 

372.59 383.90 A: oh yeah one of the most horrible cases i've seen in my life unbelievable two black guys okay they were like maybe in their twenties they take five people hostage right like uh two guys and three girls 

377.95 378.89 B: mhm 

384.02 384.88 B: okay 

384.58 386.94 A: (( or three guys and two girls something like that okay )) 

386.32 387.22 B: uh-huh 

387.59 388.80 A: (( on the )) 

389.34 399.86 A: they raped the girls and they beat the guys up and then they line them up and they execute them one by one in the head right so that was cruel deliberate murder right 

396.81 397.58 B: (( okay )) 

399.57 400.37 B: (( mm )) 

399.87 402.26 A: so it's obvious these two [sigh] 

402.50 406.69 A: black guys should get the death penalty right it's ah how do you say 

404.51 405.52 B: mhm 

407.41 416.79 A: an open and shut case right nothing to argue and that's what they got but ah they showed like couple of ah how do you say excerpts from the trial 

409.07 410.24 B: yeah yeah 

416.59 417.63 B: mhm 

416.67 424.62 A: and the defence attorney you know he starts like he was saying something like oh you know you should see how bad the childhood was 

424.52 434.04 A: you know what i'm not from this country but i don't understand how american people can put up with this crap i'm just giving you an example un- you know to finish up the um 

434.03 440.21 A: this tragic story they appealed but i doubt that anybody is going to reverse the verdict you know 

439.95 441.35 B: [noise] [noise] yeah i mean 

441.54 447.71 B: the the defence the defence attorney you know he has a duty to to try everything he can to 

447.32 452.40 A: and you know what this is one of the examples but i've seen this in a lot of cases dude are you an american 

452.51 453.82 B: yeah 

453.25 454.50 A: okay so 

455.05 457.92 A: from an american guy's point of view how come 

458.12 469.24 A: american people i mean they even have the right to say that oh she had such a bad horrible childhood you know what if you ask a lot of people you're going to see that most of the people have a horrible past okay 

469.24 473.64 B: yeah no i mean you have the right to say that but an intelligent jury 

469.71 470.88 A: including my 

471.92 476.77 A: so wh- what does your what does your past have to do with what you did 

476.94 479.51 A: you know murdering people and stuff and all sorts 

476.97 477.77 B: wh 

478.41 492.18 B: i mean i mean you can say that but it it still comes down to the jury and and you know an intelligent jury understands that well your past is only one small part of who you are and [mn] don't make you do the things you do you still make the decisions to do the things you do 

492.08 496.57 B: and so i mean sometimes [noise] the the they'll 

496.71 508.66 A: you know they use this kinda crap for all the serial killers like i dunno um i don't know if ted bundy was abused but so what if he was abused i don't care what happened in his past 

497.07 497.93 B: (( ah )) 

498.24 498.82 B: (( [cough] )) 

506.28 507.70 B: yeah i i mean 

508.06 514.14 B: yeah but maybe maybe he wasn't being maybe maybe it you know let's just assume that it did make him a serial killer 

508.74 509.73 A: (( why should )) 

511.99 512.83 A: oh 

513.95 515.55 A: i remember i remember 

513.96 524.56 B: but you know did he get off yeah ted bundy still went to jail and died you know he was still executed it didn't change the verdict it's just something that they try to 

522.54 526.90 A: right right right but it is still it's useless shit they say you know the defence 

526.90 529.57 B: right there's i mean 

528.35 529.60 A: i mean that's one ex- 

530.46 531.81 B: (( i dunno i that's )) 

530.56 532.06 A: (( that's one example )) 

532.15 533.27 A: okay go ahead 

533.23 541.00 B: no i was just going to say you know that's their job and and yeah it it's a disgusting thing that they that's what they do but you know they get 

539.84 541.00 A: i mean 

541.39 548.41 A: what does your past have to do with your present you know so what a lot of people had a horrible past that doesn't mean it gives you the right to hurt people 

544.51 545.20 B: (( [cough] [mn] [cough] )) 

548.58 550.12 A: (( ah the guy who killed paul )) 

550.66 556.46 A: i heard that his father was an alcoholic and he beat him up and he was sexually abused and blah blah blah so what 

550.84 551.69 B: (( uh-huh )) 

556.98 560.36 A: that does not give him the right to kill paul you know 

560.32 561.79 B: right no for sure 

560.40 561.67 A: (( son of a bitch )) 

562.51 566.21 A: yeah you're right the verdict is not affected it's pretty much never 

566.69 572.25 A: you know oh yeah here's another another case that really pissed me off this guy was ah 

567.59 568.65 B: yeah 

573.28 584.94 A: i dunno if he was retarded [sigh] a retarded oh man i forgot exactly but he wasn't like a hundred percent normal maybe he was a little bit retarded i dunno but he acted pretty much normal you know and he ah 

581.47 582.30 B: oh 

583.83 584.64 B: yeah 

585.18 592.04 A: killed raped and killed this eighty year old woman and then he painted her body and set her on fire you know 

592.21 595.00 A: so the defence was coming up with 

592.29 593.07 B: okay 

596.46 599.95 A: ah oh yeah that he he had a horrible
