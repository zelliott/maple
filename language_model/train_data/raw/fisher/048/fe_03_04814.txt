37.16 46.21 B: been definitely uh you know what the what the smoking tobacco companies have done over the years i i think they kind of get what they deserve at this point 

45.75 53.20 A: are are they getting what they deserve i mean i don't even know if they're uh if they are paying the price i mean are these judgments getting thrown out [noise] [noise] 

46.28 47.04 B: yeah 

52.70 65.65 B: um you know i'm not sure i know the i know there's a lot of judgments being you know levied against them but whether they're you know coughing up and i and you know from what i understand i know here i'm in i i don't know where you are i'm in pennsylvania 

65.07 66.85 A: oh i'm in i'm in california 

66.21 77.94 B: oh you're in cal- okay across the country [laughter] uh and i know that uh our state has gotten um you know some of pieces of pie and they're using it for a variety of reas- you know a variety of purposes 

67.81 69.05 A: yeah all the way 

77.84 78.90 A: okay 

77.95 82.22 B: um you know whether it's anti smoking ads or programs uh 

82.23 90.92 B: and i don't know how effective they are but um you know in tha- to be honest with you i don't know how much that hurts in the long run it hurts the tobacco companies 

90.97 91.80 B: (( you know )) 

91.10 94.95 A: right right but you know there some- i think there's more productive things that can be done 

95.05 98.18 A: in tobacco anyway they can always grow something else i suppose 

97.65 100.07 B: i i suppose [laughter] i suppose too 

99.93 110.30 A: you know i mean i don't really to me like smoking all all the ads are you know the anti smoking ads i think they are all good but i don't know if they have much effect really either i think that the movies and all that 

110.25 124.35 A: really really uh make glamorize it to the point where those ads uh i don't know that they help i really don't but i don't know what the percentage is either more people are smoking now than ten years ago or what but 

124.50 135.01 B: e- either do i and i i agree with you i think you know it's tough to undo what what the movie industry has done and and like just what you said it's made it a glamorous thing and and i see that anec- 

134.78 147.96 B: no i don't know it's anecdotal but i kind of see that around here it's it's a lot you know just every time i look at a young you know teenager or kid um i kinda shake my head you know you know i'm not sure they're doing it for 

147.89 157.55 B: you know any reason other than it's you know it it looks cool and they saw somebody in the movies do it or you know uh it somehow gives them some kind of status 

157.64 164.50 A: ye- well i do remember when i first tried smoking and it was just because i wanted to look cool i do remember that you know i mean 

162.55 164.14 B: [laughter] yeah okay 

164.30 175.14 A: that was the only reason i did it i just thought it looked cool but i couldn't stand uh and uh i don't know what you know the fact that i couldn't stand it really did stop because if i would have kept on going if i thought i was 

175.20 181.69 A: if i thought i was you know if it was bringing my status up [laughter] but as i look around now 

178.72 180.60 B: (( righ- yeah [noise] )) 

181.52 186.40 A: i mean i wouldn't even you know to me that's a neg- totally negative if a girl is smoking i 

186.23 198.54 A: i would probably think twice before ever getting too serious with someone who did you know just for that aspect i i just you know i would think twice it doesn't mean i would you know totally ignore the opportunity 

197.16 206.83 B: but um but i i i know what you're saying i'm actually uh you know i'm co- i'm coming off a a divorce or bre- you know a pending [laughter] break up of a marriage 

206.30 211.65 A: oh me too how about that [laughter] yeah we're in the same boat man i mean the same thing just moved out a month ago 

207.36 209.30 B: oh okay [laughter] 

211.25 215.58 B: i hear ya okay hope i i wish you well in that regard [laughter] but 

214.29 216.04 A: yeah well thanks [noise] 

215.55 222.55 B: but i know my wife did not smoke and now i'm looking at the field out there and i agree with ya i just you know i i think i 

222.41 230.65 B: uh a couple of months ago i i met somebody who i you know i thought was really nice and all of a sudden i see that she's walking outside uh for a smoke break 

230.53 241.14 B: you know during work and um it's a re- it's a turn you know i don't know if it would be the final nail in the coffin to kill any kind of thoughts about it but it certainly you know it it points in that direction 

237.89 239.87 A: [noise] 

240.69 245.84 A: [noise] it is a nail yeah one of the many nails it takes to to seal the coffin 

242.31 243.89 B: yeah yeah it's a nail 

245.40 247.10 B: yeah exactly 

246.31 257.41 A: yeah i i would agree with that man i uh you know so i i forgot what else what other topic they wanted us to say talk about do you remember [noise] 

253.95 263.91 B: um they were i think they were just saying just in general like uh you know how do you feel about um you know not you know bans on smoking in restaurants and bars 

263.21 264.70 A: oh yeah 

263.97 268.25 B: and i i don't know what it's like out what what city are in you in in california 

267.34 273.33 A: i'm in l._a. and we and there is ban on all indoor smoking you you can't is that how it is there 

270.51 271.85 B: yeah okay 

272.52 282.04 B: uh it's just it's just happened uh recently finally and i know that the you know the ow- the restaurant and bar owners just were up in arms about it you know and i mean 

280.93 291.34 A: [noise] you know what they were here too man and you know what a lot of 'em it's been here now for many years but uh a lot of places here you still go in there and and people are smoking and no one is enforcing 

282.62 283.41 B: yeah 

287.79 288.72 B: mhm 

291.02 292.92 B: is it really yeah 

291.19 301.60 A: uh yeah yeah seriously you go into a bar and in certain places you know and it doesn't matter people are just smoking as if it's a okay and no one in the bar [noise] does anything about it now 

301.63 302.88 A: uh 

302.71 311.33 A: my perspective is i do i don't know if secondhand smoke is bad or not i i my impression is that it is and i know it irritates me so 

309.80 311.01 B: (( yeah ye- )) 

311.29 319.42 A: i think that you know hey man go ahead and smoke but just i don't wanna have it so you know in my face so i i do like those those uh bans indoors 

319.45 321.63 A: you know when you're in a bar or whatever 

320.83 334.53 B: yeah i think so 'cause the the ar- you know the ar- their argument is that you're infringing on their rights and um you know by the fact that we're asking them not to sm- you know i think it's more of infringement on our rights than it is an infringement on their rights you're right they can go 

334.54 343.09 B: um you know they're yes they're being restricted but they could certainly there are many places that can smoke specifically outdoors you know uh there's 

342.12 351.63 A: right because they are impacting uh they're i think their rights ended where they started trampling on someone else's by smoking and blowing it and that does affect a lot of people negatively 

351.69 355.08 A: uh it doesn't affect me negatively except i just don't like it 

354.37 365.09 B: yes and and it's you know if you have children in in restaurants i suppos- you know it it it then it negatively impacts them um and i do know if we're we're 

364.98 371.55 B: if the government is you know to a certain extent if you believe the government's supposed to look after their citizen then 

371.56 372.79 B: (( um )) 

372.55 380.09 B: you know you know i you want we all want a little bit of independence but they're also there to protect us to a certain extent and uh 

379.95 389.47 B: you know i think that's one of the things it's certainly not a gun to our heads but it's it is secondhand smoke and and you know i i i suppose i've the little reading i've done on it 

389.38 399.23 B: it it seems to be um you know well not as quite as bad as smoking a cigarette but not too far behind it i guess if you're exposed to it constantly um 

397.28 410.95 A: [noise] [noise] right yeah but down here other conflicting reports that say you know [noise] that it doesn't have any impact whatsoever so it's i i i don't know what to think but i just know that it irritates me and uh i wouldn't you know 

410.81 423.65 A: i i i'm happy that they've banned it i wish they'd enforce it a little more strictly you know i mean if you if you're caught smoking then you know you should be fined and the bar should have some sort of penalty against it and can't let it happen 'cause surely the bar 

414.39 414.95 B: (( [mn] )) 

421.52 422.36 B: (( yeah if it )) 

423.85 427.80 A: you know the bar is allowing it happen and they see what's going on clearly 

426.93 434.25 B: have they made an issue of it up- out there that the you know the the law you know having a law is one thing but enforcing it is another i don't has that become 

432.62 434.27 A: (( [noise] well you know )) 

434.41 443.96 A: i think in general it it's enforced in general you know but i i mean i've been to a casino or two here uh you know and and i remember there was not a person in there smoking so you know 

436.84 437.75 B: yeah 

443.59 444.60 B: right 

444.02 454.82 A: but for big places like that they do enforce but you know if you're get in a little hole in the wall joint then you will find people smoking still sometimes you know and uh 

451.06 451.90 B: (( gotcha yeah )) 

453.59 454.36 B: well 

454.37 458.91 B: i i think in general all these you know i i'd say something um 

458.70 464.55 B: you know we- you know one of the things i i understand that tobacco companies complain about is that 

464.41 474.76 B: you know you are hurting us but you're also hurting the people we employ you know especially down south here and the southeast but um you know one of the things you know i've done a little travelling like in europe 

474.61 488.02 B: and i know that uh you know if we've not smoking they are they're certainly making up for it over there there's no there's no lack of people smoking over in europe so you know they have a huge mar- i figure they have a huge market in the rest of the world 

483.33 484.82 A: right 

487.89 494.71 B: to make their money at and i don't think you're gonna hear that many complaints from the tobacco companies ultimately um 

493.43 497.32 A: [noise] ye- yeah you know like i said though earlier man i mean 

497.57 511.56 A: if they can't grow tobacco they can find something else to grow i mean i know that that's a bit thing down in the south but uh i mean there's there's got to be other more productive things to grow if in the i know that that's a big cash crop i guess i mean that's like you know they make a huge profit on that 

509.28 510.12 B: yeah 

511.33 525.45 A: versus whatever else they might grow alfalfa but uh you know i i'm not short term i'm sure it [noise] will impact people negatively but you know that's just for a few years and then they think they're grow something else [noise] 

513.03 514.49 B: (( [laughter] right right )) 

524.49 531.01 B: no i i i i don't disagree with ya i think it's you know it's an argument that doesn't hold water and um 

530.81 545.25 B: and i like i said to you oh i think when we first talk- started the conversation i think you know there are years of covering up and and there's documentation to show that they knew that nicotine was addictive and it was cancer causing and and you know 

545.02 558.88 B: it you know [laughter] it was just simply bad for the human body you know they and they you know they proceeded to cover it up and even pump in there i guess pump up the you know the addiction uh chemicals to to get people addicted to it you know so 

553.80 554.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

556.01 556.73 A: [noise] 

558.42 571.99 A: yeah those those commercials coming out [noise] right now man those are pretty good ones i don't know if you've watched 'em but there's been a few oh there's been some that have been they've uh they've had like they've been pretending as though they were in the boardroom [noise] and the um member of the tobacco uh 

562.42 563.43 B: which ones 

572.15 578.68 A: coalition you know they're talking and they're they're talking about the public and how ignorant you know basically they're making the public look like idiots 

572.96 573.78 B: yeah 

578.27 579.23 B: right 

578.63 592.42 A: and and you know those commercials are good i mean uh and then you know most of the public actually see these and say hey wait a minute we're not as you know not as dumb as we're being portrayed here but uh yeah i 

587.07 588.03 B: what's gone 

588.18 589.21 B: (( what's gone [noise] yeah )) 

592.83 599.89 A: you know like i said overall for me smoking is just it's stupid it's childish
