0.00 0.62 B: (( ah )) 

0.84 1.81 A: (( hi )) 

0.90 2.05 B: hi i'm chris 

2.04 3.55 A: hey chris rwanda 

3.31 4.53 B: how're you doing 

4.19 5.28 A: good 

5.77 12.02 A: so the topic is terrorism and how would you react okay 

7.66 8.91 B: terrorism 

10.22 14.03 B: react to it yeah how would you react 

12.28 13.41 A: (( you want to pick )) 

13.90 15.00 A: (( ah )) 

15.09 21.03 A: i would probably at first panic but i think based on what we've seen 

21.35 25.38 A: over the last couple of years ah i don't know it seemed to 

25.52 27.94 A: ah i would seem to try to gather my 

28.05 30.87 A: thoughts a little more before reacting 

30.38 31.66 B: yeah 

31.75 46.39 A: you know examples of like r- running into that building to one of the towers versus you know you or if you're in the tower and all of a sudden you're just thinking something's happened the thing is get out quickly or move away from from ah from danger [mn] 

34.60 36.31 B: [laughter] 

37.06 38.11 B: mhm 

41.81 43.09 B: true true 

46.66 47.73 A: (( so )) 

47.78 60.51 A: ah i don't know it seems to it seems that right now the media seems to almost because of the repeat ad nauseam you almost become desensitized about it too like you know what it doesn't even look real 

56.02 56.92 B: (( mm )) 

57.78 59.07 B: right right 

61.45 62.22 B: (( oh )) 

62.08 66.99 A: and i was in oklahoma city when that when the bombing occurred so that was that was a little odd too 

66.84 67.93 B: okay 

69.99 71.34 B: well you know 

70.67 71.27 A: (( mhm )) 

71.59 80.03 B: it just depends on like n- it just depends on where i am to be honest if i'm b- around a lot of people who're just totally like panicking 

79.90 86.73 B: nine times out of ten it'll probably roll over on to me but if i'm by myself i'm usually more apt to assess the situation 

86.95 90.13 B: than i would as if i'm with a group of people but 

90.87 92.55 B: that's just me because 

92.32 106.06 B: like if i was on the airplane i probably wouldn't have 'cause i i usually fly about once once a week well dep- when i'm at work i fly about tw- once to twice a week so i'm you know i'm used to it and i i know what to expect out of a airplane ah out of a airplane 

101.92 102.80 A: yeah 

105.80 106.74 A: right 

105.92 108.87 B: what you can do to it and what you can't do to it you know 

107.92 108.92 A: right 

109.78 113.56 B: so if i'm in an environment like that i'd be i'd be pretty ah 

114.32 117.01 B: sure of myself i wouldn't panic too much 

116.93 128.40 A: yeah i mean i think i would try to at least establish some sort of control or calmness too because you know people just you're right if if you're in a mob situation 

121.98 123.05 B: mhm 

128.71 134.66 A: then ah it seems to create a large wave and you some you in a lot of cases are going to get caught in it 

133.96 135.44 B: mhm 

136.02 143.85 A: but at the same time i i don't know i think i would definitely try to at least get a way if everybody is is is mobbing toward an exit 

144.29 149.25 A: i would be pushing closer to against a wall or something to see exactly what was going on 

146.83 147.83 B: yeah 

148.60 159.59 B: well ah i would at least try to see what's going on 'cause some have you noticed that sometimes no matter if it's just like an ins- take for instance the freeway right well a wreck can happen probably 

159.60 164.00 B: five or ten minutes ago and everybody'll start rubbernecking to see what it is you know 

164.03 168.64 B: it's like people have a tendency to just look at what's going on and then 

167.97 169.10 A: yeah 

169.53 173.14 B: and then that slows everybody elses reaction time down so 

172.98 179.39 A: yeah i mean ah in in most situations especially driving ah which which you can relate is that 

176.21 177.13 B: mhm 

179.36 189.82 A: i try to figure out what people are doing because you i mean the thing is you know there is an accident and you know that people are going to lose that that train of thought as far as paying attention to what's going on 

181.24 182.11 B: mhm 

188.97 190.46 B: right right 

189.88 193.54 A: so i'm looking to see what's going to happen because 

193.60 198.87 A: something else there's always that residual affect or that that something somebody loses 

195.93 197.36 B: mhm 

199.00 207.07 A: that visual and then all of a sudden they're in an accident as well and my biggest thing is i go into this mode of okay now you've got to get defensive 

201.19 203.41 B: (( but it's exactly especially )) 

206.61 210.41 B: yeah now you got to try to avoid everybody and everything just about 

208.36 213.11 A: right so anticipation of what's happening what's going on 

211.59 212.55 B: mhm 

213.70 214.99 A: yeah 

214.30 222.47 B: same thing for when your brain you know like when you're driving down the street and then all of a sudden you get this downpo- downpour all these people are like slam on their brakes it's 

222.94 226.57 B: it's already really reaction response to be honest 

224.60 234.31 A: yeah i don't know i i think ah any k- well i mean the the first thought is you know it's always this flight or f- or fight mechanism 

233.19 235.18 B: (( fight flight or flight you reckon )) 

234.54 246.33 A: and i mean a- as much as we would like to be able to control that i think our body just will definitely react to it's like pulling your hand hand off of a hot oven or stove you will pull it away 

244.34 245.66 B: (( mm exactly )) 

246.09 247.73 B: it's it's initially 

246.74 254.35 A: now w- what what you do at that point after you know is it on fire is it stuck to it or i mean those are things that you've got to think through 

253.62 254.48 B: mhm 

255.41 256.47 A: (( yeah )) 

255.49 261.05 B: but some people don't make it to that point especially in in a mob mentality situation 

257.55 259.58 A: no unfortunately they don't 

261.46 262.63 A: yeah 

262.06 270.62 B: but now now as you think of terrorism it won't be i mean let's say if it would've happened to you it won't be as big of a shock as if it would have before september eleven 

270.27 281.42 A: well i i think there's there is a lot more sensitivity otherwise but you know people still get get to this ah this level of comfort that it's not real 

275.00 275.98 B: mhm 

281.04 283.67 B: desensitized to it right 

282.25 292.68 A: right but but also i think behind everybody's mind they understand that if if you hear something or see something that is not that appears to be unusual it probably is 

291.96 293.49 B: right that's true 

293.10 302.01 A: and then what do you do at this point you know do people you know if i was in that building people are already thinking of if i was in that building i'd be running like hell [mn] 

301.23 313.50 B: hm no if i was in that building i wouldn't be running like hell i'd be i don't know what i'd been doing but if i was on the see the thing is up until that point everyone's mentality is cooperate and you'll be okay 

306.24 307.06 A: yeah 

313.04 313.91 A: yeah 

314.00 315.15 B: but now 

316.11 325.63 B: it's hard to say now if i was on an aircraft and somebody took it over i'll be trying to take take ov- you know take back over the plane but up until now it wasn't the same mentality 

323.04 324.13 A: yeah 

324.76 329.01 A: yeah well i mean it how many people will actually sacrifice for that 

330.40 331.49 B: good point 

330.78 337.64 A: or distract 'em or i mean there's always a plan but you know that there are other options and if there's only a couple of 'em 

331.99 332.92 B: (( very )) 

338.45 346.82 A: if you can get enough people to y- in unfortunately what you're going to find out now is there are going to be a lot more people on that plane thinking the way you think 

343.44 344.38 B: mhm 

346.32 349.13 B: yeah [laughter] 

346.84 355.90 A: [laughter] and and hopefully ah you won't be the first one shot [laughter] and and you'll be able to subdue or at least calm the situation so 

351.49 353.23 B: yeah [laughter] hopefully 

354.99 359.99 B: yeah but in the situation like that all they really had was some knives and you can only do so much damage 

359.29 368.78 A: oh i mean yeah a box cutter i mean the thing is just ah if anything let 'em cut your b- or even you know smack 'em with your belt or a magazine or 

360.04 361.49 B: with a box cutter 

367.38 369.59 B: or an- an- anything 

369.85 376.27 B: ah when those little tel- you know the little telephones that all airplanes have on them you know what i mean you could use that 

372.95 373.99 A: yep 

375.92 379.56 A: well i'm thinking the first thing i'd probably do is wrap my fist around with a belt 

379.10 380.32 B: yeah 

379.64 382.74 A: and then go at 'em and then you know they're slashing at your hand 

383.01 385.58 A: there's there's less skin in- involved 

384.70 385.65 B: that's true 

385.67 393.16 A: but ah you also have other people around you either as as they point your attention hopefully somebody else is going to step up to the plate 

391.85 393.55 B: mhm 

394.20 395.10 A: so 

394.32 403.70 B: well people usually need at least somebody to step forward if one one person does something then it's kind of a chain reaction but if if nobody really steps up and takes that first move 

404.30 412.50 A: ah that's it's it's the deer in the headlights mentality of people sometimes people freeze but i s- i still think the people saw enough of this 

404.36 406.10 B: people tend to 

406.99 408.72 B: yeah they just 

412.12 413.21 B: mhm 

413.10 419.78 A: ah to last them a lifetime when you see an airplane in the air and you see that silhouette with those wings pointing up 

419.20 420.46 B: oh yeah 

419.84 421.89 A: you see that hitting the buildings 

421.39 422.61 B: yeah 

422.61 427.77 A: so and i i just feel when you you're going to hear a sonic bomb 

427.82 433.93 A: or an explosion or smoke ah it's people are going to feel different now 

433.64 439.44 B: mhm any time a a plane flying over too low when it really shouldn't be 

435.39 436.26 A: and it's 

438.97 440.18 A: oh yeah 

439.47 442.43 B: people are going to be looking up and trying to figure out what's going on 

441.56 455.73 A: o- well even when i send the i'm i i i can look out of my window and i can s- ah we're not far from the airport sometimes it looks like man this guy's coming down awful fast or awful steep it just you know you be now everybody becomes a critic and starting to watch out and 

447.30 448.15 B: (( mm )) 

451.29 452.91 B: yeah i know the feeling 'cause 

456.25 458.85 A: find out does that look right or not 

457.96 462.55 B: yeah you're right you're right assessing every situation to see if it's normal or not 

461.93 463.96 A: i don't know but i'm i'm thinking now 

464.00 467.47 A: a lot of people are thinking all right we know what they did with the plane 

468.22 471.52 A: we know what they can do with bombs but what's what's next 

470.82 473.58 B: what's next what have we not thought of 

472.55 485.56 A: what what is the most innocent or things that people wouldn't i mean in in right now in the united states you don't expect to go in a restaurant and have it blown up like you would in in in israel or ah tel aviv or something like that and it may start happening 

479.96 481.14 B: yeah that's true 

482.30 483.16 B: uh-huh 

485.22 490.15 B: yeah you could be just sitting there having dinner and next thing you know the restaurant next to you explodes 

487.88 489.00 A: right 

489.95 495.11 A: but if you're sitting in ah ninety degree weather and you see a guy walking up in a trenchcoat something better click 

494.54 498.28 B: [laughter] yeah yeah that is so out of the ordinary it's 

497.70 501.86 A: right right i mean something something's got to click that ah i don't know 

501.05 511.40 B: but see but see nowadays you know people wearing trench coats in the middle of the summer you you know like a after columbine you know there was a big group of people wearing those black trench coats 

510.78 512.92 A: yeah yeah 

513.41 515.06 A: yeah it just you never know 

514.80 516.12 B: yeah 

516.73 519.19 A: i don't know um again 

519.41 528.80 A: hoping that you're going to do the right thing and be able to and at the same time and y- i i would think that a lot of people it's not like also what are you thinking about what you're going to do it's like 

528.27 530.24 B: but what is everybody else thinking about 

528.84 531.88 A: can i well and can you help somebody else 

531.07 532.38 B: mhm 

532.52 533.47 A: (( ah )) 

533.67 542.10 A: you can always run out but ah i mean i've pulled a lady out of a fire and it's just a totally different feeling because a lot of times you're not even thinking 

541.90 544.01 B: yeah like for instance 

542.28 544.26 A: you're just you're just doing 

543.98 550.97 B: i seen this guy get hit by a motorcycle and i mean it was just like i just stopped ju- well i was driving a styx so as soon as i stopped 

550.81 560.54 B: you know you don't pop the question i just jumped out and ran over there i really didn't think about it till after the fact that i'd actually stopped got out the car went over to see if they was you know if you could help 

553.66 554.65 A: yeah 

560.38 561.68 A: yeah 

562.04 576.11 A: and i think this is that's that whole thing of terrorism too is is is okay what are you going to do do you take control ah and do you actually not only take control but then try to help out the situation do i mean 

562.11 563.27 B: but 

564.45 565.82 B: mhm 

574.15 575.37 B: exactly 

576.00 580.53 A: i'm just hoping that if i don't see something and somebody else says no don't go that way go this way 

580.00 581.24 B: mhm 

580.56 582.39 A: that it's the right move 

582.98 586.51 A: because unfortunately we had some people that i think were going up in the building 

586.58 592.54 A: when they should have been going down but it was probably forced because of that smoke going up the stairwells but 

588.55 589.31 B: yes 

590.70 597.14 B: mhm exactly and then not only that there were some people in the building they told them not to go anywhere just to stay there 

596.99 598.16 A: oh man 

598.55 599.49 A: yeah
