0.07 1.29 A: alan 

1.24 2.38 B: (( leah )) 

2.95 3.92 A: hi 

3.66 4.49 B: hi 

5.01 8.00 A: um well this is an interesting topic 

7.89 8.79 B: uh-huh 

8.63 14.33 A: i i think i actually think most people are going to uh panic you know 

13.58 14.48 B: mhm 

14.39 17.75 A: they'll probably freak out and do all sorts of crazy things 

17.20 18.58 B: mhm mhm 

18.51 19.58 A: um 

19.98 22.86 A: i'm not i'm not sure what you think [laughter] 

22.29 23.08 B: mm 

23.61 30.92 B: it's so funny um that this topic came up because just today um i was uh watching a documentary about the titanic 

30.94 34.24 B: and um i was thinking in my mind nine eleven 

34.26 38.85 B: like you know what what people felt about that and um 

39.35 46.47 B: yeah i was i was thinking um during the documentary they were talking about you know have you heard about the movie ghost of the abyss 

47.16 51.15 A: um i think i heard about it i don't think i've seen it though 

50.72 56.25 B: yeah it's kinda weird but um it's at the imax theaters and the thing about it was that 

56.68 60.87 B: the option was there to be a hero or a coward you know like [laughter] 

60.91 73.14 B: from that moment where like you have to worry about your own life but then at the same time you have to worry about the lives of other people also and so um what it made me think about was um there was one line in the movie that said um 

73.23 86.52 B: it really depends on the character of individuals and not like the whole group mentality 'cause i think it's true if it was uh the whole group i think it would be like i think like the first reaction is panic of course 

86.77 100.39 B: um but you know with a few individuals that like do a selfless act then other people might follow you know other people might like take that as a cue and do it because maybe that's just the right thing to do 'cause they've been trained to do that too 

100.67 101.53 B: but 

102.09 102.95 B: yeah 

102.26 104.49 A: right no i think i think 

104.90 116.15 A: that there will be you know some people will will do the right thing but like i would guess probably three fourths of the people are going to panic and go crazy i mean even 

108.58 109.42 B: mhm 

114.45 115.62 B: mhm 

116.49 117.99 A: even with um 

118.51 126.45 A: they they recently had some uh it wasn't a terrorist attack but they had the fires in those night clubs 

126.12 127.18 B: mhm 

126.55 130.66 A: and the people just panicked and and trapped you know 

130.39 132.20 B: (( mm mhm )) 

130.73 137.06 A: they just stampede people to death just trying to get out you know doors were locked and i think they'd just freak out when 

137.23 142.43 A: you know in the face of uh you know possibly death or whatever 

142.07 143.13 B: mhm 

143.12 147.17 A: and and that typically is what happens with a lot of people you know 

146.55 147.29 B: (( yes )) 

147.32 153.29 A: a few will try to keep their cool um probably you know but they're caught up in it all 

153.62 154.97 B: mhm mhm 

155.04 168.37 A: but you know i can only imagine uh being you know being in the fiftieth floor of that building and and you know and feeling the explosions or whatever before you know of the trade tower um 

167.50 168.44 B: mhm 

169.51 172.54 A: you would just the first thing is just want to get out of there 

171.96 183.85 B: yeah yeah i know it's it's a scary situation sometimes you wonder if people were calm or were trying to be calm maybe like in every situation like that like more lives would be saved 

183.69 187.92 B: just by just that by kinda like clear headed thinking you know 

188.48 190.11 A: right and and they 

190.34 204.48 A: like with the trade center they said they announced that everything was fine um you know you can go back um and do your normal thing that there was [noise] you know nothing wrong with the second tower and you know there was kind of um 

204.83 213.02 A: you know when something strange like that happens you you've got to look a little further and and say okay now does this make a lot of sense 

212.41 214.98 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

214.09 221.26 A: you know and when the second plane obviously crashed you know that's that's time to get you know something funny is going on here you've got to get out of there 

219.86 222.45 B: mhm yeah yeah 

221.70 224.97 A: so i i don't know what's going to happen now um 

225.49 227.01 A: you know with all these 

227.22 233.65 A: uh you know they've been going on for years over- overseas you know with people suicide bombers 

233.27 235.35 B: mhm mhm mhm 

234.72 238.09 A: i i just don't understand people 

238.45 251.88 A: you know people doing such a thing it it doesn't make sense you know that to kill yourself over some cause you know that that you don't really well you know it's it's kinda hard to think in those terms 

240.36 241.73 B: mhm 

243.08 244.40 B: yeah 

246.26 247.27 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

251.52 253.13 B: yeah 

252.98 266.89 B: i think it's sometimes they imagine like they're one of their family members might've been affected and so it's like easier to do it to for your your family's sake you know or like person that you knew got hurt or like by someone else and it's like 

267.07 272.35 B: i could see someone getting really angry about that and wanna take take back some control 

272.57 275.12 B: like make get yeah get even 

272.70 274.61 A: or or revenge i guess 

275.61 277.20 B: yeah 

276.33 278.12 A: that's a possibility 

277.64 278.88 B: yeah 

278.21 285.40 A: but but i actually think um you know if if something happens over here you know people are going to panic 

285.00 286.42 B: mhm 

287.23 288.73 B: yeah i agree 

288.44 289.79 A: i mean even 

290.15 292.99 A: even when we were bombing uh bagdad 

293.39 294.37 A: they 

294.64 302.96 A: you know they started going crazy and you know they were looting and stealing all the treasures and and i think people just 

303.23 309.63 A: you know they figure well things are happening which we're just gonna you know take what i can get i 

310.18 315.69 A: you know it's it's kind of sad to say but i think you know the majority of people are gonna do that 

315.10 316.67 B: mhm mhm 

316.60 318.52 A: so but um 

317.49 318.32 B: yeah 

319.03 321.91 A: on on the other hand i think um 

323.13 326.36 A: you know the way of of looking at this whole war 

327.06 330.83 A: you know and i think what everyone's asking for in a certain way 

331.53 335.91 A: i'm not sure if if we had a really good to go over 

335.64 336.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

335.95 341.71 A: and um you know they haven't found anything yet uh you know these weapons of mass destruction 

341.32 342.99 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

342.37 350.72 A: is that they don't have them so you know you wonder what you know what these other people are thinking about our country and um you know 

343.67 344.50 B: mm 

351.15 362.13 A: it like you would think that at a certain point there's going to be a lot of people hating this country um more and more each day thinking that you know we'll show you then and um 

363.03 364.48 A: you know these people 

365.35 370.20 A: you know if they want to get even exactly how they're going to do it it's it's really hard to say 

366.82 367.72 B: mhm 

369.81 371.54 B: yeah yeah 

372.01 377.36 A: yeah it seems seems like it's easier to get into this country than most people think um 

372.07 373.13 B: yeah 

376.15 377.58 B: mhm mhm 

378.29 380.04 A: you know now 

380.05 385.89 A: cana- up there in canada they're panicking over this um mad cow disease and 

385.94 390.19 A: you know i can kinda understand that 'cause that's that's not too far from us 

389.49 390.81 B: mhm mhm 

390.34 391.36 A: um 

391.48 401.10 A: in you know if you had your your life savings in uh invested in some cattle and all of a sudden they get some sort of a disease and you're gonna lose them all 

401.58 404.18 A: you know those people are gonna start panicking 

403.61 404.85 B: mhm mhm 

404.73 407.06 A: i mean you know one one thing is 

408.15 411.79 A: you know they may feel well they wanna get rid of their cattle before uh 

412.09 423.23 A: you know before they're detected or whatever they they may start pooling those things around in a truck to get rid of them um you know try to cross the border and you you just don't know 

418.62 419.47 B: (( mhm mm )) 

421.44 422.35 B: mhm 

422.63 424.40 B: mhm 

424.23 432.74 A: and uh you know if you're if you're facing losing everything you have you know you're you tend to do some crazy things and um 

431.50 432.45 B: mhm 

432.98 435.07 A: and and by the same token 

435.30 436.72 A: i'm just wondering 

437.65 447.75 A: if this mad cow disease was maybe planted up there by some terrorist you know is it possible to spread that bacteria or germ or whatever it is 

447.16 448.03 B: mhm 

448.14 450.87 A: um you know what's next 

450.32 452.82 B: mhm mm mhm yeah 

452.39 462.12 A: i mean you know there's no telling that these people could be flying around the world sticking uh you know infecting animals with all sorts of stuff that we're not gonna know about 

461.51 462.41 B: mhm 

462.56 463.71 A: so 

463.27 472.10 B: yeah and it's unfortunate that like if if that was the case like canada like was it really involved you know like or like like what 

472.29 477.33 B: like whose country like how how dirty their hands are you know [laughter] like in some of them 

477.80 480.87 B: like uh the treatment of other countries 

480.92 483.58 A: right well they also understand that they 

483.95 489.11 A: they could fly into canada without hardly any uh detection 

488.56 489.90 B: mm mhm 

489.17 492.53 A: and then it's not that hard to get into the united states 

491.99 493.72 B: mm yeah 

492.89 493.76 A: you know 

494.30 509.23 A: there are some borders you have to cross but you know it's pretty pretty easy you know i i went to nigeria falls a couple of years ago and you just drive across and then once in a while they'll pull over a car and just kind of ask some questions and then you go on your way 

507.78 508.88 B: mhm 

508.97 510.05 B: mhm 

509.43 510.34 A: um 

510.44 512.52 A: it'd be so easy for someone 

513.14 518.50 A: you know get in the back of their vehicle and or mini van or whatever and hitch a ride 

517.87 518.76 B: mhm 

518.53 522.51 A: um and you could walk across some places um 

522.62 525.56 A: you know much easier to do than uh 

525.76 527.64 A: uh than a person thinks 

527.47 529.55 B: mm mm that's true 

528.70 531.36 A: so so you never know uh 

531.74 535.23 A: you know if if the threat's gonna be coming through uh 

535.87 538.26 A: mexico canada or whatever 

537.76 539.07 B: mhm mhm 

539.62 545.73 A: but you know you just see it all the time that people people panic over uh 

542.28 543.57 B: mhm 

545.82 547.34 A: crazy things 

546.76 553.53 B: yeah yeah and that's why it's so important to have like um a country that's educated you know that like 

553.69 561.04 B: that can read and understand like directions and like that you know certain things you know it's like 

561.25 564.19 B: certain things you can't control other things you can like 

564.25 573.59 B: so it's kind of like you you need the population to be well educated to to prevent all the fear and the hearsay and the rumors and 

573.77 583.62 A: um well on on the other hand people you know they hear so much misinformation that you know they don't often necessarily trust what they hear 

579.94 580.90 B: (( yeah )) 

582.89 584.33 B: exactly 

583.70 596.73 A: um you know like the president's you know we're going to war than really to the real reason why we're doing that and since there's no much mistrust of the government i think the people just feel they they can't trust them 

596.12 598.20 B: yeah yeah 

596.91 599.90 A: and you know if something happened first thing
