5.14 6.71 A: ah this is victor 

7.02 8.08 B: okay 

7.70 12.62 A: i am ah in cambridge massachusetts um 

12.75 15.06 A: i work for a company called b._b._n. 

15.75 23.15 B: okay ah i'm in sterling heights michigan wh- about forty five minutes south the er ah north eastern detroit 

22.86 25.14 A: mhm wow 

25.15 26.47 B: (( [laughter] )) 

25.44 31.99 A: [laughter] we're quite a ways away um terrorism i guess is the topic 

32.34 33.58 A: (( ah )) 

34.05 36.40 A: kind of appropriate for ah 

36.76 38.48 A: the age i guess 

38.69 42.43 B: well actually i it's been a lot on the news lately 

42.27 44.69 A: yeah absolutely um 

44.76 52.10 A: it's been on i don't know i guess it's on everybody's mind but it's not something that really frightens me all that much 

52.44 57.54 A: um maybe that's um maybe i'm being naive about the situation but 

57.91 59.14 A: um 

59.49 65.85 A: well the question was how would we react and how would the people around us react was that it 

65.86 66.97 B: correct 

66.81 68.05 A: yeah 

67.90 77.64 B: i th- i think people in general would panic i mean you're going to have some people who are going to remain calm in any situation but in general for a terrorist i mean they're 

74.48 75.63 A: yeah 

77.67 79.91 B: they're just going to freak i mean use 

80.70 82.90 B: anything you ever see if there's 

83.41 85.79 B: you know a an accident 

86.19 93.01 B: you know you've got people fleeing from the scene and and then you've got your people who are you know taking charge and getting things done 

88.64 90.57 A: mhm 

92.61 96.06 A: yeah absolutely hopefully there's more of the latter 

95.30 97.11 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

96.33 97.50 A: than 

97.98 103.19 A: but i yeah i agree i i i live in boston and i know that um 

103.37 111.62 A: it's one of the most unorganized cities i've ever been in and if anything did happen people would just freak out and go crazy 

111.61 122.55 A: and ah because ah i don't know because of the diversity o- of you know the different ethnicities and stuff i think that people could possibly start turning on each other and it could 

122.63 131.17 A: um not turn into just a lot of people fleeing and running around and trying to you know get themselves situated by lashing out against each other 

131.27 135.96 A: because ah um you know that that terrorist stereotype 

136.52 137.91 A: but 

136.66 146.37 B: well i i i guess from september eleventh we didn't see that much here in michigan because dearborn is a high um muslim population 

141.47 143.00 A: mhm 

145.82 146.82 A: really 

147.32 151.86 B: and ah there was a there was a lot in the local papers about you know 

152.09 156.42 B: you know we're yes we're muslim but this is not what we're about 

155.87 157.26 A: mhm 

157.07 161.45 B: and i don't think i saw any you know publicized 

161.48 166.08 B: attacks on you know any of the arab muslims just because 

166.11 168.09 A: of their religion 

168.26 170.82 B: well ah their religion or their 

169.17 171.84 A: (( r- religion and their ethnicity also )) 

172.11 173.40 B: right 

172.85 182.11 A: um yeah i i think there were there might have been a little bit more over here on on the east coast than in boston um i know that a lot of people um 

182.03 196.95 A: you know don't lash out that way but there were a few incidents i can't recall exactly it was kind of you know a while ago but i know that um at one of the un- local universities bin laden's cousin or n- or nephew went 

196.98 203.66 A: one of his nephews some relative of his and um there were huge riots and they had ah um 

203.72 212.25 A: the authorities had to come out come in and um extradite him safely so that they could fly him back to his country or wherever 'cause 

212.30 221.64 A: he had numerous death threats and you know somebody set fire to the building that he was in and it was kind of ah kind of crazy but 

221.65 223.69 B: kind of ignorant 

222.95 230.51 A: yeah pret- yeah pretty it is it is it's pretty ignorant it is i agree um yeah they you can't 

223.77 226.00 B: [laughter] 

230.94 232.42 A: but ah i 

232.38 247.34 A: i i think that it would happen and unfortunately especially if you know there were lar- say ah i don't know the extent of terrorist attacks that we should be talking about right now 'cause i i don't know if i really have any concept of what's possible 

247.30 258.98 B: i i i guess n- nine eleven i- is ah is a huge terrorist attack but i i i guess in general most terrorist attacks are very small you know the car bomb the suicide bomber 

247.38 248.42 A: (( you know )) 

255.92 256.94 A: yeah 

258.67 259.50 A: yeah 

259.62 264.08 B: you know less than fifty casualties well fifty dead 

261.76 262.90 A: yeah 

263.48 265.57 A: yeah but 

264.69 266.64 B: they consider [laughter] 

266.02 271.23 A: i think that i think that something you know a suicide attack in a major city would be 

271.17 272.25 A: um 

272.18 284.90 A: would be huge because ah people would you know y- it's not like you can watch a plane y- y- you can't watch these people walk you know into a building and blow it up and with you know knowing what's going on 

284.79 291.83 A: so i think the people would m- most likely f- fr- freak out all over the place if one of those something like that would happen 

291.97 295.14 A: because you you know you can't trust your neighbour and it 

295.21 299.71 A: seems like it's all for all um when with those small attacks 

300.14 303.61 A: i don't know with it do you kind of understand ah 

304.30 306.21 A: what i'm thinking about there 

307.02 313.37 B: well i i guess my my thing is is you know have you spent any time outside of the u._s. 

313.30 315.64 A: ah not extensively no 

315.34 323.14 B: okay well i spent ah two years in germany during the fall of the wall and prior to that two years in el paso texas on the 

323.33 326.01 B: border of you know u._s. and mexico 

325.56 328.04 A: yeah 

326.70 333.86 B: and in germany they make you aware of terrorist events i mean because i was in the military and it's like 

332.03 335.22 A: (( mhm )) 

334.40 336.26 B: you can be targeted 

336.86 338.24 B: and ah 

339.99 348.62 B: this is back you know eighty nine was when i got out so before the gulf war so it's kind of 

346.06 347.03 A: mhm 

350.21 355.72 B: i know what to expect so i don't think i would panic in such a situation 

352.16 353.16 A: yeah 

355.86 359.40 B: i mean you got two choices you're going to live or you're going to die i mean that's 

359.30 361.16 A: yeah 

360.45 366.91 B: and in a terrorist attack it's it's going to be over in a blink of an eye it's going to be what do you do after 

366.58 379.26 A: yeah yeah definitely so do you do you think that people would panic more if say a string of suicide bombings were to occur in major cities 

379.43 383.87 A: more than um they they panicked when ah 

383.97 386.28 A: nine eleven happened 

386.21 390.98 B: well i don't think they had time to panic in nine eleven i mean it was 

388.73 389.97 A: yeah 

390.67 392.46 A: it was like you said it w- 

391.07 396.27 B: you know maybe the people on the plane but you know once it happened everybody 

396.35 403.56 B: as far as i read there was no you know mass panic to get everybody out of the buildings yes everybody was leaving 

404.00 407.64 B: but it wasn't so bad that you know they're pushing and shoving and 

407.63 415.51 A: yeah but in the in new york city afterwards like the day of and the day you know the few days after i think there was 

415.59 421.47 A: there was some panic and a lot of people leaving and you know not really knowing what was going to happen next 

421.92 422.91 A: um 

422.20 427.12 B: well the whole i mean are you safer leaving or staying where they've already hit 

426.55 427.92 A: yeah true 

428.02 431.28 A: yeah yeah 

429.95 430.92 B: i mean 

431.91 443.36 B: realistically the u._s. have most people in the u._s. have no idea how large we are as it's y- you know you can't you can do a terrorist attack but it's not like israel 

437.89 438.72 A: mhm 

443.08 444.48 A: yeah 

443.87 447.42 B: where where you're limited to a small land mass i mean 

447.83 453.82 B: in the u._s. you're probably better off staying still than trying to move and be where they're not going to go 

453.51 454.78 A: yeah definitely 

454.98 459.19 B: unless you want to move to the middle of the desert or you know the top of the mountains 

457.48 469.94 A: yeah that that's why ah me and my room mate we're from maine and that's why we always say that if anything happens we're going straight to maine right right to where our our home is in right next to the canadian border 

470.03 471.91 A: (( and )) 

470.42 476.55 B: well i mean that's that's where i'm at i'm you know forty five minutes out of detroit i mean i can be in 

473.45 476.16 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

476.81 478.79 B: ah canada in an hour 

478.27 481.61 A: yeah yeah it's probably one of the safest spots 

481.85 485.21 A: well maybe not you know who knows i guess 

485.18 490.32 B: well then again ah you know there was a before the ah cold war was over 

490.51 493.70 B: michigan is a large manufacturing state 

493.26 494.19 A: true 

494.26 499.87 B: and we have a lot of military stuff like at the time we had the warranting plant which is huge 

499.37 501.38 A: yeah 

500.78 503.86 B: and i mean if you're going to hit something that's what you're going to hit 

503.45 507.79 A: yeah yeah that would be a big blow i guess 

508.50 517.22 A: yeah try to take out take get the military by the throat and um i don't really know what their tactics would be you know would they 

517.35 530.45 A: just aimlessly walk around and try to kill as many people as possible or would they try to strategically take out say our military or a branch of the government so that they could break the whole system down 

530.58 531.66 B: well if they 

530.60 531.92 A: i don't 

531.94 536.90 B: if if it was well organized they'd actually go towards the citizens and leave the government alone 

536.58 538.05 A: yeah 

537.74 541.33 B: i mean the gov- government is is well organized and well protected 

541.13 542.67 A: yeah 

541.95 546.99 B: i mean the things that you should worry about are you know your water 

546.96 549.19 A: mhm 

547.30 552.61 B: i mean we take a lot of stuff for granted i mean but if you poison the water 

552.45 553.41 A: mhm 

553.64 559.60 B: you're affecting the most amount of people as opposed to the they're worried about you know gas attacks and all this 

559.25 560.56 A: yeah 

560.28 562.35 B: and 

562.64 571.17 B: nerve gas and such it distri- it you know goes away with the air you need a closed in space to get a good affect 

567.75 568.69 A: yeah 

570.85 572.49 A: yeah 

571.85 575.90 B: i mean and right now it's not a good time wait until christmas hit them all then 

575.56 577.13 A: (( yeah )) 

577.54 581.82 B: i mean but even then are you i mean you're only going to get a couple of thousand people 

580.12 589.37 A: yeah yeah it's not like you said it's not like israel where if you hit 'em all there you might take out a a percentage 

590.93 595.63 B: right but i mean ah in the u._s. it like i said we're so huge 

590.94 592.25 A: yeah 

595.02 596.60 A: yeah 

596.00 599.90 B: is e- even a well organized attack
