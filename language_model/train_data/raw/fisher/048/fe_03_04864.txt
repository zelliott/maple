3.01 4.07 B: hello 

4.19 5.34 A: [noise] hi 

4.75 5.43 B: um 

5.88 8.29 B: i didn't sorry i didn't hear the question 

8.81 15.10 A: um something about terrorism m- i don't know i'm really confused [laughter] i don't know what's going on [laughter] um 

15.23 16.67 A: have you done this before 

16.59 17.88 B: no i haven't 

18.03 22.48 A: okay um i think it's about like um 

22.70 26.50 A: would you st- would you stay calm during a terrorism attack 

27.04 33.64 B: oh well that would be really hard to i don't know it's something that you can't really decide when you haven't experienced it you know 

33.73 39.60 A: yeah um i don't think i'd pr- i probably wouldn't stay calm maybe i don't 

39.23 42.88 B: yeah that would be really hard i mean unless 

41.58 42.80 A: (( know and )) 

42.96 44.38 B: unless you weren't 

44.71 49.40 B: because when nine eleven happened you know i'm on the west coast so it's not the same thing 

48.08 48.80 A: (( right )) 

49.51 52.92 B: and i couldn't really know what was going on 

53.12 57.01 B: and i mean i wasn't i mean this sounds so bad but i didn't really 

57.23 59.55 B: feel very much of the effects 

59.84 62.76 A: (( yeah i was on lon- i was also on the west coast so )) 

63.07 70.82 B: yeah so i think when you're not directly in it it has a big factor on whether how you know how calm or not calm you're gonna be 

63.26 64.22 A: um 

64.57 65.60 A: but yeah 

71.09 74.66 A: yeah it's still kinda scary i was at school i don't 

75.18 79.76 B: yeah i didn't even think it was real when it happened like i thought it was kind of like a joke or something 

80.79 82.17 A: (( know yeah yeah um )) 

82.41 85.99 A: [laughter] we're supposed to just keep talking [laughter] 

85.53 90.27 B: [lipsmack] um i guess so [laughter] um [noise] 

90.50 91.62 A: um 

92.00 94.03 B: well did anything have it like 

94.22 103.95 B: when i'm not sure if like it has to be foreign terrorism but like you know when all that columbine stuff happened wasn't your school kinda freaked out and stuff 

101.37 102.31 A: yeah 

104.43 107.14 A: yeah i don't really remember that that well 

107.17 108.73 B: (( [noise] really )) 

107.32 108.26 A: (( i don't )) 

108.87 109.71 A: yeah 

108.89 116.55 B: because i know when that happened like they started like most of the classes didn't really happen and we just spent class time talking and stuff so 

116.20 123.35 A: i don't know i really don't remember when that happened there what what we did at all i remember what happened when 

122.85 127.53 B: oh i remember being a sophomore so [noise] it must've been 

127.77 130.14 B: two thousand i think 

130.48 135.27 A: (( yeah um i don't remember my year [laughter] ah i )) 

131.46 132.43 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

136.03 140.91 A: guess i don't i don't i don't really remember it the only one that i really really remember is nine eleven for some reason 

141.21 141.96 A: but 

141.28 142.11 B: what 

142.32 148.18 A: (( the only one that i really remember is nine eleven that well like like exactly where i was and what i was doing and stuff i )) 

145.05 146.29 B: yeah 

149.14 150.47 A: (( don't know um )) 

149.15 152.02 B: did you know people on the um east coast 

152.08 153.18 B: like in new york 

152.56 156.71 A: yeah i knew so- yeah i knew some people and called them and stuff they were fine 

156.10 158.37 B: [noise] yeah i didn't even know people 

158.46 165.87 B: that lived in new york so it was kinda like i didn't even have people that could relate to me what was going on 

158.50 159.34 A: yeah 

166.36 170.33 A: yeah i i knew a couple of people like i mean ah that 

170.41 172.63 A: (( and like cousins and stuff )) 

170.84 171.68 B: mhm 

175.22 177.09 A: (( i don't know ah [laughter] )) 

176.30 178.44 B: [noise] hm ten minutes is a long time 

178.46 182.82 A: yeah it never seems like i didn't think it was gonna be that long [laughter] 

182.26 183.33 B: mhm 

183.08 184.28 A: um 

184.84 186.59 A: yeah um 

188.55 193.38 A: i don't know like is it i guess some people react in different ways i don't know if i'd be calm or not 

191.86 192.90 B: mhm 

193.72 199.19 A: i think i'd be calm but then afterwards i'd freak out like after i realise realise what's going on 

197.07 198.22 B: yeah 

200.55 201.59 A: (( [lipsmack] ah yeah are )) 

202.61 203.90 A: you in college 

204.12 205.24 B: yeah i am 

205.31 206.76 A: (( yeah okay me )) 

208.95 211.80 B: (( mm i think i would be i don't )) 

211.93 212.98 B: know 

215.70 220.79 B: i think i would be calm just because i wouldn't really believe that it was happening i guess 

220.72 222.22 A: (( too yeah )) 

223.42 223.99 B: (( [noise] )) 

224.17 232.84 A: yeah um [laughter] um i don't know where like it's kinda i guess it would be kinda similar to in like an earthquake or 

233.21 234.39 A: (( something like that )) 

233.32 234.42 B: yeah 

235.96 240.40 A: i guess i was pretty calm during the big earthquake in l. a. 

236.37 237.19 B: but 

239.82 240.82 B: mhm 

240.89 241.85 B: mhm 

242.55 243.61 B: i wasn't 

243.71 251.57 B: be- yeah like i was just thinking like i probably was not freaked out during nine eleven just because like by the time i heard about it it was pretty much over you know 

251.52 252.75 A: yeah 

252.16 254.93 B: 'cause you know because of the time difference so 

254.50 256.17 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

258.35 260.05 A: (( ah [laughter] )) 

258.50 262.12 B: and then like were you freaked out during the war that something was gonna happen 

262.63 264.08 A: um 

264.57 269.44 A: kinda but i kinda tried to ignore it i don't know yeah 

267.25 268.26 B: mhm 

268.86 272.28 B: i mean it didn't even seem like anything had really changed right 

272.61 275.39 A: (( yeah well it's kind )) 

274.16 275.29 B: (( i mean it's hard )) 

275.67 277.48 A: (( of hard to know if there's gonna be )) 

275.80 277.17 B: it's hard to take 

277.45 282.70 B: yeah it's hard to take things like that seriously when l- like it doesn't you don't even feel any effects 

284.93 286.60 A: definitely 

287.33 288.41 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

291.03 291.85 A: (( [laughter] )) 

292.41 294.47 A: strange topic [laughter] 

293.79 294.92 B: (( [laughter] )) 

294.52 300.71 A: not that i guess not that really not really that strange i don't even get the point of this whole thing i don't 

297.88 298.61 B: (( mm )) 

300.74 301.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

301.48 307.06 A: know i think it's i don't kn- i don't think it's the topic that matters i think it's how we interact when we're talking about this i'm 

306.49 308.04 B: yeah yeah 

307.59 309.01 A: not really sure though so 

311.48 315.50 A: i guess you figured out what it's all about [laughter] i don't know [laughter] 

314.85 315.59 B: (( huh )) 

315.93 319.03 A: (( i yeah i don't know i guess you've figured out what it's about i don't know )) 

318.71 319.51 B: mhm 

320.82 323.03 A: (( yeah how much longer do we have do you know )) 

323.40 325.24 B: how oh i don't know 

324.95 328.66 A: i think we have like four or five minutes [laughter] 

328.67 331.46 B: i bet we have a long time left [laughter] 

332.27 333.91 A: yeah 

333.65 337.61 B: i don't know i was kind of disappointed when we got terrorism 'cause i was like 

338.10 342.01 B: i don't know that's such seemed like such an obvious topic 

342.08 343.70 A: (( yeah yeah [laughter] i )) 

343.91 349.02 A: mean there's a lot to talk about that but like what d- do you feel like when during a terrorist attack i don't know 

349.26 353.35 B: yeah yeah it's not really something you can 

350.44 351.95 A: (( yeah it's too s- )) 

354.18 355.06 A: (( [laughter] yeah hm )) 

354.37 358.48 B: i don't know it's kinda pointless to talk about 'cause why even 

358.49 360.98 B: try to you know why it 

362.91 366.26 B: doesn't really seem like something that you would really 

366.36 369.88 B: well oh let's imagine what we're gonna act like um 

369.40 371.99 A: hopefully i wouldn't act 

372.40 373.88 A: (( like too )) 

374.49 376.38 A: ah scared and stuff 

376.57 377.55 B: yeah 

377.97 379.04 A: (( 'cause i don't )) 

380.13 387.06 B: well i don't really keep in that good um like i'm not really that up to date with current events and stuff 

380.67 381.38 A: (( know )) 

387.03 387.88 A: yeah 

387.11 390.01 B: so that's another reason why i didn't really like the topic 

390.21 391.27 A: [laughter] 

391.50 394.84 A: i'm pretty like i i know quite a lot but it is 

394.20 395.32 B: really 

395.03 400.70 A: (( it doesn't like this is like this specif- how specific the topic is is kind of strange yeah i don't know )) 

400.38 401.39 B: mhm 

405.33 409.44 A: (( i kinda have to know a lot since i go to u. c. berkeley [laughter] i don't know )) 

408.62 409.77 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

411.02 415.68 B: [noise] well that doesn't i go to berkeley too [laughter] and i don't really know very much yeah

419.66 420.87 B: yeah it is 

422.65 424.35 A: (( i don't know [laughter] )) 

427.09 430.07 A: (( yeah [laughter] that's funny )) 

429.75 432.12 B: (( [noise] yeah 'cause this is like a p._e._n._n. )) 

432.41 434.14 B: ah research thing 

432.43 433.69 A: yeah 

434.35 437.12 A: yeah i got like an email from this guy i don't know 

437.07 439.59 B: so did i [noise] 

438.95 441.49 A: (( yeah [laughter] maybe we got the same guy i ))

443.19 444.24 B: he was mean

452.91 454.02 A: (( funny [laughter] )) 

453.27 458.96 B: i wonder if everyone ends up talking about this topic for the entire time because 

458.44 459.42 A: (( i don't know )) 

459.62 463.72 A: i don't think we get like the ten dollars unless we do it for the entire time but 

459.74 460.86 B: [laughter] 

463.69 464.70 B: if what 

464.79 467.84 A: i don't think we get the ten dollars unless we do it for the entire time oh 

467.78 472.59 B: oh i mean like if people actually end up talking about their topic for the entire time that 

471.60 474.38 A: (( okay well yeah probably )) 

473.36 476.13 B: 'cause right now we're not really on the topic [laughter] 

475.88 478.63 A: (( yeah maybe we should get back on that yeah [laughter] )) 

479.18 480.79 A: (( ah [laughter] ))
