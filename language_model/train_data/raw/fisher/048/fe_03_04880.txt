1.04 2.38 B: hello 

1.88 2.93 A: hello 

2.83 6.13 B: yes i'm calling about with the fisher thing 

5.82 7.12 A: (( yep [mn] )) 

6.89 10.90 B: okay have you ever watched any high profile trials 

7.72 8.73 A: so 

11.38 12.78 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

12.80 19.69 A: not right through like i probably watched maybe an hour of the whole o. j. thing 

18.68 22.25 B: an hour i was glued to the chair 

21.70 26.04 A: [laughter] i i got sick of it real soon it was just [noise] 

22.45 28.78 B: [laughter] did [laughter] [laughter] when they had a break i would get aggravated [laughter] 

27.94 30.45 A: (( [laughter] )) 

28.79 33.85 B: [laughter] how i had to sit you don't need a break [laughter] 

32.81 35.82 A: [laughter] [mn] you see [mn] the 

35.85 42.95 A: thing is i was like pretty much against the whole idea actually of of having it live 

43.66 45.00 A: (( 'cause )) 

45.43 48.07 A: i think it kinda um 

49.51 51.45 A: biases the whole 

52.15 53.39 A: procedure 

53.22 54.30 B: yes 

54.15 63.70 A: because so they're supposed to find like i mean it's not just the televising of the trial it's the televising of the whole thing leading up too so the jury's in theory supposed to be 

63.73 68.24 A: completely impartial and not have any opinion on it before it starts 

68.39 73.70 A: but how are you gonna find anyone like that in that case right 

71.45 72.37 B: well 

73.27 76.74 B: even if it isn't televised how are you gonna get a jury 

76.44 81.52 A: well so i think there sh- needs to be like a gag order on the whole thing you know after they [mn] 

82.13 88.77 A: arrest him to have i think it's not i don't think ah t._v. news people should be able to 

89.00 92.11 A: comment on the case until it's over 

92.33 100.56 B: well that i agree with you there but i do believe they should have a trial and i do believe it could be should be televised 

100.38 105.51 A: [mn] [mn] do you think it would be better if it was ah televised but not live 

106.97 109.20 B: yeah now that that's about 

110.37 112.33 B: at least you would know they were 

112.30 121.75 A: [mn] that way you know if it's televised you kinda see it and there's kinda an accountability there because if they like do something really screwed up and ah you get to see it 

121.85 123.20 B: yeah 

122.61 125.67 A: and on the other hand 

125.79 127.22 A: it doesn't 

128.34 131.05 A: [mn] it doesn't turn into like a circus 

131.33 132.16 A: (( you know )) 

131.70 136.38 B: [laughter] i and well ah in your history books 

132.28 134.23 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

136.58 141.17 B: the ah people used to be put in stocks 

141.66 147.68 A: well yeah that's it's the same it's the same thing all over again in a different way right 

146.28 149.04 B: [mn] and they had the trial before 

149.43 155.77 B: they put 'em in the stocks out in the o- in the public because our trials are in the courtrooms they're in the public too 

155.57 157.35 A: right 

156.46 161.94 B: we could be happy about that you know we could live in russia where they don't do that 

161.39 171.00 A: right so yeah but if we had a public trial at least not everybody's gonna be there at the same time so you can still you know say that say that they like go through the trial 

171.15 172.94 A: and they 

173.78 176.98 A: they declare a mistrial and they'll need to have another one 

177.49 178.60 B: yeah 

178.02 180.99 A: and they need to choose a new jury 

182.07 185.28 A: how are you gonna do that if you've had a live 

186.93 189.20 B: it's already been publicized 

188.89 190.27 A: yeah 

189.86 196.42 B: well how about all the write ups and all in the paper where people are already he was already convicted 

196.40 198.29 A: (( [mn] right [sigh] )) 

196.51 198.87 B: before the trial 

198.33 202.69 A: right and and that's the problem right i mean like the jurors are not allowed to read the paper 

203.44 206.07 B: yeah but they read it before they're chosen 

205.51 212.64 A: [cough] right and that's right so it kinda so what's the point of [noise] keeping the jury like sequestered if 

206.34 207.04 B: they 

212.78 216.65 A: you know they're already gonna be flooded with the stuff before they go in 

216.48 217.36 B: right 

216.75 219.11 A: right it's kind of a 

219.67 222.09 B: six of one and half a dozen of another wh- 

220.79 223.22 A: yeah exactly 

223.56 228.95 A: i dunno what the right thing to do is it's just i it looks like it's a problem i dunno 

229.50 232.65 A: whether there's an easy solution to it 

232.03 237.79 B: well at that the o. j. was on court t._v. and on the news 

236.54 237.11 A: (( [cough] )) 

237.86 241.87 B: and do you know since then i haven't watched any 

242.36 244.46 B: of the trials [noise] 

243.86 245.93 A: oh it was just that one 

245.32 251.25 B: that was the only one i watched completely i've seen maybe two or three minutes or something you know 

250.96 253.26 A: right when they put it on the news or something 

252.64 254.08 B: yeah 

253.54 255.26 A: yeah 

254.26 255.66 B: but um 

256.73 257.83 B: how about 

258.26 260.26 B: oh i cannot think 

261.28 265.88 B: i cannot think of his name there was another there was a television 

266.72 269.87 B: the one that they accused of of killing his wife 

270.24 272.01 B: he wants to be on 

272.74 278.04 A: [laughter] [laughter] make some money on the side 

272.88 273.97 B: (( t._v. )) 

276.33 279.50 B: robert um robert blake 

280.82 284.14 B: [noise] is that the one i'm thinking about [noise] yeah robert blake 

284.20 287.38 A: i don't hear of him wh- when was this 

287.30 295.44 B: oh [sigh] well he used to have a program on t._v. with a parrot that sat on his shoulder he was an investigator 

295.76 300.62 B: and he was ah a real tough guy he played detectives all the time 

300.11 301.02 A: uh-huh 

301.40 302.55 B: and 

302.56 304.29 A: and then he killed his wife 

303.01 309.26 B: he dropped out of sight and maybe just a few commercials he did a battery commercial with ah 

309.46 315.47 B: it sitting on his shoulder like he's got a chip on his shoulder so knock it off you know [noise] the battery 

315.08 316.02 A: uh-huh 

316.29 321.32 B: and you didn't hear about him any more then he was supposedly 

322.02 331.17 B: left his gun in a restaurant and he went back to get it and while he was gone back to the restaurant somebody came up to the car and killed his wife 

333.08 334.13 A: whoa 

333.15 336.85 B: ah this is not too long this was in the last year or so 

336.25 345.22 A: oh why i i completely missed that [laughter] [laughter] that's what i mean i don't follow the court cases [laughter] i [mn] 

339.39 340.85 B: [laughter] 

343.15 349.76 B: well it wasn't it hasn't been publicized yet it just when it was written up it said he wanted to be on ah 

350.72 353.60 B: the he wanted his trial publicized 

354.64 356.02 A: yeah i guess 

356.87 362.25 A: it's one of those things where if you publicize it d- does it make ya chances better or worse right 

361.62 362.58 B: (( i don't )) 

362.59 365.10 B: i i think he just wanted the attention 

366.54 368.83 B: i think he was the way it was written 

366.54 373.90 A: well but d- did he just want it for the sake of it or was he trying it just because he thought he could make some money or did he think it would help his case 

372.47 374.48 B: well now that too probably 

374.41 380.35 A: like you know the next thing you know he'll sell his story to some movie producer and and [laughter] 

374.55 375.64 B: the money 

378.58 379.44 B: yep 

380.73 382.63 A: you gonna be 

381.16 388.04 B: and then the what about the kennedys ah one of the stray cousins that killed that girl in 

388.49 394.27 B: connecticut they didn't get her or get him for twenty something years forty eight hours did that one 

392.68 396.52 A: (( mhm yeah [sigh] )) 

396.58 397.95 A: yeah so 

398.66 399.77 A: but 

399.92 400.48 A: (( [mn] )) 

400.57 401.85 A: i guess 

404.58 406.25 A: yeah when you look at it that way 

404.96 409.59 B: i think the public has a right to know and i think the public has a right to see the trial 

409.72 412.20 B: but even the people in the courtroom 

411.70 412.26 A: (( [sigh] )) 

412.85 416.61 B: you know there's just more people are seeing it that's all when it's on t._v. 

417.27 426.15 A: yeah yeah so the question is how do you like let them see it then and at the same time make sure it doesn't screw the trial up 

425.97 428.33 B: yeah well they always 

428.41 430.39 B: they always go with the d- ah 

430.55 432.06 B: that's a problem 

432.28 436.76 B: any time because most people when they go in there has already got their mind made up 

436.45 438.92 A: mhm mhm 

437.17 440.30 B: no matter what you say they've already got their mind made up 

439.71 443.24 A: yep well in the big cases yeah like in 

443.31 445.77 A: i guess in like more normal ones 

446.06 449.27 A: they don't care either way so they don't have 

450.32 452.52 A: as much of a bias going in 

452.41 454.11 B: yeah somebody 

453.10 457.82 A: but yeah with the o. j. thing like any any one of the jurors that walked in 

458.01 461.86 A: already had made their mind up whether they said so or not 

461.25 462.10 B: yep 

461.92 462.81 A: so 

463.04 464.42 A: it's hard to tell 

464.87 469.65 B: and i don't there was a c- case here in south carolina that was um 

469.74 477.23 B: publicized on the court t._v. but i didn't watch it [sigh] but my goodness it moved so slow there was no 

477.03 478.11 A: [laughter] 

477.30 481.40 B: i watched maybe fifteen minutes of it because my mother knew 

481.84 485.27 B: [mn] his great aunt's first cousin or something 

485.78 489.59 B: and ah it moved so slow it was so boring 

489.26 495.03 A: [laughter] well that was the other thing with the o. j. thing most of it was pretty boring it was just y- 

495.37 496.15 A: (( you )) 

496.18 499.19 A: know like um then c._n._n. would like it was like 

499.86 508.37 A: it was like f- it was like watching like ah you know like the sports reruns like where you watch the news and they show you all the highlights 

508.06 509.26 B: mhm 

508.69 513.84 A: [laughter] it was the same thing you know it would be like cut out all of the boring bits where 

514.48 518.53 B: i'd say somebody should televise every bit of it or 

518.65 524.29 B: or tape every bit of it and then cut out the boring stuff and make it into a two or three hour movie 

524.63 527.78 A: but then the thing is that it it makes the 

528.45 530.24 A: lawyers just wanna 

531.35 537.04 A: you know make a big splash even with and completely ignore the details where the case really is 

537.59 538.78 B: yes 

538.25 542.93 A: and s- it's like it turns into entertainment rather than 

543.11 545.68 A: finding out who's guilty and who's not 

546.38 553.24 B: well we know who was guilty but we know who didn't get charged i still think he was guilty but we aren't supposed to be 

552.25 561.06 A: well yeah and that that's the whole right i mean it i think part of the reason that the case was decided the way it was was because it was on t._v. 

560.93 562.11 B: mhm 

561.58 566.20 A: um you know johnny cochrane up there making him put on the glove you know 

566.55 568.89 A: (( [laughter] it [mn] )) 

568.12 569.01 B: well 

569.20 571.48 B: anybody knows that ah 

572.50 577.70 B: marsha clarke should have known that any time a glove has been wet it's gonna shrink 

578.32 584.39 B: sh- even if it fit him yesterday and in between time it got wet it's not gonna fit him today 

582.40 583.47 A: yep 

584.21 593.31 A: yeah and that's the thing it's completely irrelevant to the case but you know it makes a big impact because you know it's visual and it's on t._v. 

592.84 593.81 B: yeah 

593.47 595.45 A: and it sways people 

595.98 597.84 B: well it swayed the jury 

597.58 599.95 A: (( well yeah but ah but ))
