407.84 409.30 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

410.48 414.46 A: i don't know i mean they they were close to it when uh 

414.72 416.72 A: [lipsmack] when what's his name was the

428.55 431.00 A: it seemed like they were close to it but 

431.37 435.43 A: i don't know i i don't see it happening unless unless 

435.57 438.60 A: an israeli president comes along who uh 

437.14 440.82 B: (( right )) 

438.86 443.44 A: is willing to really make great uh concessions you know 

443.63 445.96 A: to just get rid of a bunch of settlement 

446.27 451.98 A: uh in order to please the palestinians which i think is really really 

446.40 448.28 B: mhm 

449.07 450.72 B: well 

453.39 454.14 A: (( uh )) 

454.17 457.70 A: asking for something you know i think it's really a long shot [lipsmack] 

458.50 462.64 B: well what do you think a war is about 

461.98 464.02 A: what do i think a war is about 

464.35 471.17 B: (( mhm )) 

464.67 465.93 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

469.31 471.06 A: this one in particular 

471.33 474.68 B: (( uh just general what the military's )) 

473.08 474.46 A: just in general 

475.12 477.78 B: right israel and palestinian 

475.25 476.75 A: yeah 

477.94 480.30 A: yeah well they uh [lipsmack] 

485.38 486.46 A: well they 

488.43 490.92 A: i mean they both have the same land you know 

491.70 497.49 B: mhm so the war is about the land 

492.86 494.13 A: and 

496.67 505.88 A: yeah well it's about the right the right to the land i mean the land has so much meaning for them you know it's a homeland for both of them 

504.06 506.34 B: (( mhm )) 

506.27 507.91 A: and uh 

508.70 512.28 A: you know and that has and that means uh 

512.61 515.99 A: not just land but uh you know religious 

514.49 521.54 B: (( right )) 

516.26 519.03 A: uh religious things as well and uh 

520.24 523.66 A: that's extremely important for them and uh 

523.84 525.85 A: i mean obviously 

527.15 531.48 A: both parties uh are willing to die 

531.88 532.87 A: (( uh )) 

532.97 534.97 A: or would rather die 

535.00 538.79 A: than not have that as their homeland 

539.55 554.73 B: (( right )) 

540.48 541.92 A: and uh 

543.85 548.16 A: i don't w- when you have a conflict that is so 

549.69 557.14 A: [sigh] when you have two sides that are so uh diametrically opposed like that i i don't see any 

557.40 558.52 A: um 

560.05 562.54 A: any uh practical 

562.75 563.90 A: uh 

564.09 570.37 A: way to peace than probably through war i mean which is terrible but um 

571.82 577.63 A: but i mean you can achieve peace through war it's just a it's just a terrible option to to take you know 

577.78 580.40 B: right 

579.09 580.37 A: yeah 

581.32 592.64 B: well i just find it very interesting i'm not saying that uh there's a right answer out there but you know if the war is about land you know 

587.89 589.00 A: right 

593.67 599.44 B: when does it become israel's land
