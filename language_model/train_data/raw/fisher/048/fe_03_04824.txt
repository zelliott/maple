5.32 6.64 B: good how are you 

6.54 7.76 A: oh i'm doing fine 

8.52 12.29 A: so is this your uh your first time participating in the fisher project 

11.70 12.93 B: yes [laughter] 

13.46 15.77 A: oh my first time was yesterday so 

15.09 17.59 B: okay so you know how to do it you lead us 

17.17 18.35 A: okay [laughter] 

17.68 18.53 B: [laughter] 

18.67 19.93 A: um 

20.14 24.99 A: i guess if you wanna begin um how do you think people would react to a terrorist attack 

24.76 27.55 B: um i don't think most people would remain calm 

27.76 29.53 B: i think they would be panicked [noise] 

29.66 31.53 A: i'd have to agree with that um 

32.52 33.40 B: um 

32.70 34.73 A: most people tend to um 

35.12 41.99 A: uh at least in los angeles and they act irrationally when things happen earthquakes riots that type of thing 

39.24 40.23 B: yeah 

41.33 50.01 B: i think they react like that everywhere actually i was in new york when they um the planes hit the twin towers and people were definitely panicked and not acting rationally 

51.34 52.56 A: um 

51.84 53.40 B: so yeah [laughter] 

52.74 54.09 A: [laughter] 

54.58 59.04 B: and people have been acting irrationally since the planes hit so [laughter] 

57.99 59.80 A: (( yeah )) 

60.42 63.29 A: i guess you can say that the whole war on terrorism is 

63.31 66.35 A: a reaction to nine eleven so 

64.57 67.81 B: yeah it seems like it it seems like you can 

68.36 72.25 B: kind of get people's emotions riled up now just by saying terrorism 

72.63 75.11 B: and then they sort of freak out and 

75.84 76.65 B: stop 

75.99 78.45 A: i mean human history that's 

77.77 79.06 B: yeah exactly 

79.38 82.91 A: you know mccarthyism a reaction to communism so [laughter] 

80.66 81.79 B: yeah 

82.17 82.94 B: mhm 

83.81 85.51 B: i guess anti terrorism 

86.75 88.47 B: is a reaction to terrorism 

89.78 91.56 B: so um 

93.04 93.94 B: yeah 

94.14 95.03 B: uh 

96.11 98.36 B: so what happens when there's an earthquake [laughter] 

99.22 108.34 A: um well you know people i was actually in a movie theater uh a couple of years ago and there was this small tremor and the first reaction of everyone was to 

105.59 106.44 B: uh-huh 

108.44 112.07 A: basically just try to get out of the theater and it was like a herd of cattle 

111.67 113.97 B: like pushing over other people and stuff 

113.45 116.67 A: um yeah you know people just almost getting trampled and 

116.25 117.84 B: oh that's so awful 

117.48 120.67 A: it's like people were probably more likely to get hurt by 

120.79 126.54 A: the gut reaction than by actual earthquake because it was just a small tremor it wasn't didn't do any damage but 

123.07 124.08 B: yeah 

126.30 127.64 B: yeah 

126.57 129.13 A: everyone was just thinking of themselves 

128.42 135.08 B: even in the twin towers thing like i was brooklyn when it happened but people started driving like going through red lights and stuff 

135.20 147.07 B: i mean what what does that have to do with anything you know why would you not obey the traffic lights and so i was walking around and everyone was just really like i mean i know it was scary time but it still doesn't give you the right to run someone over you know 

147.06 149.68 A: yeah it is just the fighter flight reaction 

147.72 148.68 B: [laughter] 

148.89 150.46 B: yeah exactly 

149.96 152.16 A: you're just running on gut instinct 

151.48 152.47 B: yeah 

152.84 156.91 B: i i bet that these topics are really um something that you would never discuss 

157.29 161.63 B: a lot with is that right [laughter] 

158.86 165.64 A: oh probably um actually [laughter] yesterday we were talking about banning smoking in public places 

164.43 171.35 B: yeah oh i guess people will disagree then [laughter] that's a heated topic [laughter] to talk to a stranger about 

171.38 173.71 A: well actually yesterday we agreed on that too 

173.36 178.58 B: okay i don't think that people will say that people will react to terrorism rationally though do they 

179.35 184.37 A: um well i guess some people probably think that new york it could have been worse 

184.25 188.48 B: yeah i do agree with it that it could have been worse the way they could have reacted 

187.84 191.93 A: like there wasn't a full on riot there wasn't marshall law wasn't 

192.74 196.50 B: yeah but marshall law is in place in new york but um 

192.89 194.99 A: i mean i mean probably could have been 

197.01 202.32 A: but i mean we didn't see like tanks coming in or anything like i mean it could have been a lot worse i guess 

199.27 200.44 B: yeah 

201.27 203.05 B: there's still like lots of men which 

203.10 205.71 B: machine guns all over the place now 

206.35 210.39 A: oh yeah i mean you see that in california at the airports too we have the national guard everywhere 

208.34 209.51 B: really 

209.91 219.97 B: yeah they're everywhere they're in the subways they're like i went up to the um to sort of the harlem area and they're there's like these tiny little subway stops and there's like national guardsmen there 

220.79 222.46 B: (( like it was so crazy )) 

222.91 224.20 B: i just um 

223.97 229.91 A: i mean it could have been a lot worse like marshall law declared across the nation kind of no one gets in no one gets out 

227.40 236.93 B: [laughter] yeah no one has any rights at all or nothing [laughter] i guess it could have been like that we should think of it that way [laughter] 

231.16 232.65 A: [laughter] 

234.98 239.81 A: i gue- well i mean compared to places that have been dealing with terrorism for years like israel i mean 

239.25 244.70 B: yeah i've never been there a friend of mine was just there and he said it was crazy yeah 

242.49 244.06 A: oh really 

245.13 247.20 B: he was there actually during the war 

248.36 254.32 B: but um he said that um the- people are strip searched coming into and out of israel 

255.32 257.31 A: i don't think i could live like that 

256.82 258.05 B: no way 

258.19 263.43 B: i don't know but but once you're in israel it actually does feel really like peaceful and no- um 

263.70 266.13 B: not dangerous or scary 

266.24 267.48 B: (( that's what he said )) 

267.88 272.12 B: like it's not like there's not like this overwhelming feeling of terror really 

272.91 276.53 A: is it just that they've been living like that for so long it's just old hat 

276.13 287.99 B: i think so i mean even in england like i was there for a while and i was kinda looking for somewhere to put like some garbage that i had and there's no garbage can like public garbage can because people used to put bombs in them 

286.90 288.95 A: is the i._r._a. and everything 

287.77 291.47 B: yeah and i guess i guess you just get used to it right 

292.03 300.45 A: i i don't know it just seems like we've been living in this fantasy land just this has been going on in the rest of the world and we've just been lucky so far 

300.28 301.40 B: yeah 

300.78 302.78 A: now it's time for us to kinda 

303.07 304.60 A: face reality 

304.05 305.06 B: yeah 

305.46 308.11 B: i don't know i just saw this thing about how 

308.21 317.57 B: there was this bill that was just passed that said any that it it was proposed in texas that any mem- person who's a member of like an environmental organization or an animal rights organization 

317.64 323.78 B: could just a member like somebody who gives money to the sierra club or something would could be considered an eco terrorist 

325.23 326.65 A: [sigh] i mean 

326.82 329.61 A: similar things happened in the patriotic bill and 

328.96 337.60 B: yeah yeah so i don't know i guess like when you get everyone when something bad happens we'll kind of overreact sometimes and then 

337.66 340.96 B: just kind of you can take advantage of that i think 

341.55 345.11 A: i'm just worried that um we're on the road to kind of a 

345.77 352.88 A: i don't wanna use the word nazi party but there's a lot of talk about how this is kinda like ninety thirties in germany 

348.37 349.59 B: (( yeah )) 

351.92 358.77 B: yeah with this fear and the scare and that's what i think too like i feel like the people who are using the like attack 

358.97 371.64 B: are are the terrorists like they're the ones that are kinda spreading terror you know like like people who are saying well if we don't you know take away everyone's civil liberties all across america by you know calling them all terrorists and tapping their phones then 

371.63 384.84 B: you know then there's gonna be something else happening like this and i think that you really need to be calm and it's one thing that happened and it was really really bad i mean i was there it was horrible but it's also not a reason to you know throw the 

384.61 386.75 A: yeah i agree it's an overreaction 

384.88 386.99 B: bill of rights out the window you know 

387.35 396.69 B: but and i think people can y- you know right now like they can use it to their advantage politically you know we bomb whoever we want we can do whatever we want in the name of terrorism 

396.92 399.70 A: although you for politicians i mean that's 

399.41 400.99 B: that's what they do i guess 

400.17 402.14 A: that's what they do all the time [laughter] 

401.25 403.47 B: yeah i know it's disgusting 

402.23 404.30 A: i mean look at world war two i mean 

404.66 409.95 A: pearl harbour so suddenly you have japanese american citizens who are being put in interment camps 

408.95 411.14 B: i know it's awful 

411.37 413.43 B: but we shouldn't do that though [laughter] 

414.14 415.16 A: (( i )) 

415.30 418.29 A: i don't know 'cause on the one hand you know 

418.51 421.74 A: maybe they do have a point maybe we need to be 

421.82 422.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

422.46 430.91 A: a little more serious now and but on the other hand maybe we are just starting to overreact and we just need to calm down 

424.62 425.53 B: yeah 

430.97 436.05 A: we may actually be making things worse by just going out and doing these preemptive strikes 

433.81 439.44 B: yeah bombing whoever yeah what do you think the res- the whole country thinks about it 

440.49 443.36 A: um [mn] well considering that uh 

442.91 445.94 B: this is really neat by the way just to talk to some random person 

445.32 446.67 A: (( [laughter] i know )) 

446.02 447.92 B: [laughter] 

447.85 453.00 A: well i mean in the two thousand election it's pretty you know the country's pretty evenly split between gore and bush 

452.54 453.80 B: yeah 

453.15 456.71 A: so i think um in the upcoming election we're probably going to see 

457.05 463.71 A: a lot of people coming out and they're still going to be angry about the recession about the corporate scandals 

463.57 468.25 B: do you think people are angry about that i hope they are because i i feel like those are real 

466.21 471.50 A: i think i think the republican party are a little too comfortable with their situation right now 

470.95 471.90 B: mhm 

471.62 474.01 A: because considering in the first gulf war 

474.22 483.50 A: we came in we were victorious but there was still a recession and bush still raised taxes even though he said he wasn't going to and he wasn't re-elected as a result so 

474.34 476.34 B: yeah i know that's exactly what happened 

482.61 483.77 B: yeah 

484.36 487.92 B: i think those corporate scandals are really really horrible i mean 

488.17 491.14 B: not that that it's a scandal but that people like 

491.55 495.62 B: that that happened and they got away with it totally you know like they 

494.89 498.23 A: well it seemed like a total did you ever see the film wag the dog 

497.78 498.87 B: yeah 

498.63 502.28 A: yeah it just se- seems a little too close yeah 

499.52 503.00 B: where you bomb them to get awa- it does doesn't it and then 

503.15 505.97 B: yeah it just yes 

504.80 509.90 A: and for a while people did forget about enron and world com and everything because of the war 

508.11 510.84 B: they totally did because of the war and 

511.20 516.71 B: i hope that people are i mean from a really small town like i live in the city now but um 

516.26 518.87 A: oh same here a small town in northern california 

517.34 520.20 B: yeah upstate new york and 

520.33 522.98 B: they literally sell freedom fries in my town 

523.49 525.92 B: [laughter] and i've some 

524.81 527.55 A: [laughter] i still i still can't believe that 

526.72 528.84 B: [laughter] no it's actually true 

529.13 532.08 B: in my home town i'm here right now and it's just like 

531.96 546.56 B: i brought some friends from new york down to kinda visit like my parents live here and they're away and stuff and uh one of them was like i'll have some french fries and the guy the diner owner was like what [laughter] and my friend was like i'll have french fries and the diner owner was like what fries 

541.88 543.18 A: [laughter] 

547.73 553.22 A: i can't i still can't believe that congress officially did it it just seemed like the most so childish 

548.40 550.36 B: [laughter] 

550.81 552.78 B: when did congress officially do it 

553.61 555.42 B: did they really do that [noise] 

554.82 564.52 A: oh yeah if you go and it was on n._p._r. how um in congress the cafeteria they officially changed it to freedom fries and like freedom toast and it just seemed so immature 

560.42 563.01 B: that's disgusting like do you know 

565.36 571.10 B: but that it's not even immature it's like double speak in communist russia in the thirties 

569.82 574.30 A: well it it's downright orwellian it's it's new speak in ninety eighty four 

571.65 572.99 B: yeah 

573.55 575.45 B: exactly it's ridiculous 

576.56 577.82 A: [laughter] 

576.97 578.54 B: (( i mean [laughter] )) 

578.31 580.24 A: i mean i mean [laughter] 

578.72 587.10 B: give me a break like france is our best friends you know like practically they disagree with us on the war like good like so you can disagree with someone and 

581.46 583.49 A: and then they're supposed to be 

587.00 595.19 B: you know all of a sudden [laughter] can disagree they could possibly disagree like they feel you know 

588.04 592.14 A: i mean i'd i'd rather have a country that you know can disagree with us and 

595.63 599.95 B: like they're not so scared or would you have friend that's like that you know that just would
