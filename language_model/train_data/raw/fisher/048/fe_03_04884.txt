4.10 5.42 A: hi marcie 

5.12 5.97 B: hi 

6.14 9.96 A: i guess we're supposed to talk about the big profile trials uh 

9.58 13.62 B: i think that's the topic all right have you ever watched one on t._v. 

11.28 11.84 A: (( [cough] )) 

13.20 15.42 A: i watched the o. j. simpson trial 

15.75 17.30 B: the what ti- trial 

16.22 18.04 A: (( [noise] simpson )) 

18.32 19.66 A: (( o. j. simpson )) 

18.46 19.48 B: oh 

19.66 23.30 B: yeah yeah i watched that too i didn't 

21.47 22.30 A: yeah 

22.45 24.10 A: i couldn't take him 

23.82 28.06 B: yeah i didn't get to watch all of it but i did watch the least i could 

26.05 30.69 A: oh yeah i watched but i watched like and then at night on court t._v. they recapped it and then 

30.09 33.49 B: yeah ah yeah yeah what did you think 

31.63 33.16 A: (( i watched it )) 

33.47 40.46 A: um and it's wh- wh- what was the first part of their question that said if you've ever watched it and if you think it should be televised right 

39.84 42.12 B: (( yeah yeah i think )) 

41.13 42.30 A: (( well i do )) 

42.21 50.59 B: [sigh] yeah i do too i do too because ah you know i think that there's just a lot of us especially in you know a case like that 

42.35 43.49 A: what do you think 

50.60 55.22 B: that are very interested in seeing how it was handled 

54.61 60.24 A: right pl- and plus you know the news doesn't always give you exactly the accurate thing they give you their like 

60.34 66.78 A: their idea of it not so much as what you- you'd take on it it's their take and what they want the public to know 

67.05 68.91 A: and make it more dramatic 

67.22 68.35 B: yeah 

69.22 81.31 B: yeah i think so too and i also think that if you get to see some of it you actually get to you know see the the facial expressions and the changes and i i think that's very interesting 

79.15 80.10 A: (( [noise] right )) 

81.46 83.19 A: (( have you ever watched some of the other ones )) 

83.76 84.73 B: did i what 

84.54 87.67 A: (( have you ever watched any other ones or just o. j. )) 

86.26 87.48 B: [sigh] um 

87.67 89.09 B: mm 

89.86 92.67 B: do you know i don't think i really have 

92.72 93.77 B: i'm trying to 

92.78 97.17 A: i watched a i watched the one ah the woman that killed her three children 

97.19 99.55 B: so oh yeah yeah 

98.78 99.69 A: i remember 

99.81 103.26 A: (( [mn] i watched that one on t._v. i can't think of her name )) 

101.56 102.81 B: what was that 

103.99 107.77 A: the one that ah had three children she put them in the car and pushed them in water 

107.38 110.46 B: oh yeah i remember that 

110.07 113.18 A: when i i watched that one 

111.09 111.93 B: oh 

113.30 123.46 A: because i just couldn't believe that you know she was on t._v. talking about please i want my baby back and you know where the children are children and then the next thing you know she really did it herself 

113.59 114.54 B: yeah 

119.83 120.76 B: oh 

123.20 127.48 B: yeah yeah yeah i just what a sick deal that was ah and you're watching her on 

126.91 135.81 A: i know and and then you watched her on the t._v. at the trial it's like i can't believe this is the same person i still but that was a great trial to watch because 

127.51 129.04 B: ((  )) 

136.00 139.38 A: [sigh] you know here's this person that fooled the whole country 

139.91 141.08 B: (( like how could you you know how could )) 

140.10 147.07 A: (( yeah )) 

146.46 154.50 B: you be that way yeah i just i i just thought that that was you know beyond just just beyond a normal person's to even begin to 

154.60 157.87 B: to understand what was going through her mind 

154.61 155.64 A: i know 

157.39 170.88 A: i know and and i don't know i think at the same time as um the court that the court shows i think they should maybe not televise it from beginning to end the kinda because some of it could be really boring 

170.41 171.80 B: yeah yeah 

171.40 180.11 A: but it does you know the whole pro- the high profile ones all the more because to let people know just you know what's really really going on 

179.79 181.50 B: (( yeah yeah and )) 

180.60 182.65 A: and not not 

182.97 187.51 B: it's going to be interesting to see what happens about that laci case out you know 

186.49 188.66 A: oh i know that will be a good one 

188.66 189.89 B: yeah 

188.74 194.93 A: (( yeah another ho- hi- high profile one and i'm sure they'll televise i wonder if that's going to be televised )) 

191.34 192.83 B: exactly 

194.17 196.99 B: i don't know i kinda hope it is because 

197.00 209.46 B: i just i have a real bad feeling about that deal and he was another one that went on and you know made a big show and a big play about looking for his wife and everything like that 

200.67 201.73 A: i know 

207.86 213.30 A: right and until we got a lover came forward you know everybody fooled that too he had people fooled too 

213.15 214.89 B: yeah exactly 

213.57 215.75 A: actually we believed him yep 

215.42 218.95 B: well no and then then he said that you know he went fishing 

218.96 224.87 B: and i mean come on wasn't that a little far fetched with her pregnancy being that far along and everything 

222.14 223.03 A: (( i know )) 

224.77 227.82 A: yeah exactly you know it's true 

227.73 228.98 B: [mn] yeah 

227.93 236.83 A: and that would be good to see on t._v. because you know he he again he's another one who pulled fool tried to fool the whole world and you can't believe it and then 

235.36 236.20 B: yeah 

236.99 240.08 A: you know when you watch it on t._v. like wow 

240.15 247.54 A: look at these people how gr- how you know they can fool they just like they're so evil that they can just do that 

246.90 250.51 B: mhm yeah i and i think evil is a perfect description 

250.57 251.59 A: yeah 

250.72 258.50 B: ah that that they they really can and i guess there's a lesson to all of us in that in that 

258.73 261.92 B: things aren't always what they seem you know 

261.02 263.01 A: (( [laughter] isn't that the truth )) 

262.66 264.48 B: [laughter] 

263.77 265.86 A: [laughter] that's very true 

265.53 267.77 B: yeah it it 

266.11 274.17 A: right yeah and and it does make you realize because you know when you when you watch it you know like you watch the news on t._v. and they tell you a little bit about it or 

273.85 275.12 B: mhm 

273.96 282.25 A: you check on the internet you get a completely different feel for it and then when you turn it on and you watch the the new the ah courtroom scene 

282.07 283.27 B: yeah 

282.68 294.63 A: it's completely different 'cause you're right their mannerisms how they handle themselves and you you get a chance to form your own opinion rather than just whatever whatever way the newspapers want you to ah to flay 

290.89 292.38 B: exactly 

294.56 296.13 B: sure because they can 

294.77 296.86 A: you know they a person 

296.74 305.93 B: they can be prejudiced just like anyone else can and ah when you're just reading it all you're really getting is just their their take on the situation 

299.11 301.44 A: exactly exactly 

305.60 308.75 A: exactly exactly you can make you know form your own opinion 

308.66 320.98 B: yeah that's that's what i like about it too and as i said i kinda liked to to look at the different facial expressions and um kinda get a feel for what that person is really about and 

314.71 315.68 A: (( mhm )) 

320.35 327.89 A: exactly yep it's true and i do enjoy that they they only when they want to put it on t._v. it 

327.44 328.64 B: mhm 

328.05 336.25 A: seems like i don't know see i don't know what determines what gets on and what doesn't and what you can you know like who decides if we have the right to see it [noise] 

336.06 338.61 B: yeah you know that's interesting uh i 

338.47 351.91 B: that would be interesting to know who does decide whether we can see it or not because that o. j. simpson thing and and it was just so fascinating to to watch the different lawyers and watch his face and 

348.11 349.24 A: (( yeah it was )) 

352.07 353.12 B: um 

352.96 355.55 A: watch him try on the glove [laughter] 

354.62 356.42 B: yes yes 

356.08 357.65 A: [laughter] 

356.85 363.42 B: and and to see you know see the different expressions and everything i i just thought you know it was it was fascinating 

362.08 372.57 A: right and how could anyone ever you know explain that in in the newspaper article or on t._v. unless you watched that whole trial you could never appreciate just what a 

367.81 368.63 B: yeah 

372.90 377.84 A: a b. s. the whole thing was and and how he just completely got away with murder 

372.94 374.50 B: no you're right 

377.71 383.51 B: absolutely absolutely and did it in front of the whole country 

383.29 384.20 A: yes 

383.62 385.37 B: [laughter] i mean 

384.85 390.09 A: yes [laughter] he did and everybody sat there and watched and if he was guilty but 

385.64 387.07 B: ah it's 

387.20 388.45 B: amazing 

389.87 403.94 A: i didn't they need to see the jury have to delivering come back and say you didn't give us enough to convict him knowing that he was guilty but taking the responsibility and and if you weren't watching it on t._v. you could have never like he you had to agree with them 

396.57 397.69 B: yeah of course 

403.50 405.16 B: yeah but you know 

404.16 411.19 A: yet knowing if you could have seen it on t._v. you wouldn't have known that they really were put in a position where they couldn't convict him hm 

409.46 423.80 B: yeah exactly and you know then i thought two of the the black people on on the jury well how in the world are they going to go back and function in the black community if they had in fact voted to find ah o. j. guilty i mean 

423.42 425.09 A: sure i never thought of that one 

424.67 428.44 B: yeah i think that it would have been extremely difficult for them 

425.46 426.53 A: mhm 

427.92 433.80 A: right and that's another thing if we didn't get to see that on t._v. you wouldn't have realized the ratio and and 

428.59 429.85 B: to to 

433.13 434.62 B: exactly 

433.96 439.01 A: you know what was on there and again it helped you realize the whole the whole dynamics of it 

438.81 446.82 B: yeah see i i absolutely agree and and you're right we we would not have had ah a clue as to what really was going on 

443.61 444.50 A: mhm 

446.78 455.39 A: and when they first came out with court t._v. they televised almost every court you know anything interesting and then they kinda slacked off a little bit and put on these 

453.00 454.00 B: mhm 

455.37 463.35 A: t._v. shows instead of the court t._v. i don't know if you've got it on cable from you know when they first started with it 

457.68 458.72 B: yeah 

463.41 468.98 A: i was ad- yeah i don't want to say addicted to it but a lot of times i would put that on versus like a sitcom 

468.59 478.52 B: yeah see i i really enjoy the news programs i really do i'll i'll always watch a news a program ah instead of i have maybe 

472.10 473.02 A: mhm 

478.46 491.80 B: two shows three shows max that i i kinda think are cute and if nothing else you know comes up that i'm more interested in i'll i'll watch them but yeah i would ra- much rather watch um a news program or a 

482.38 483.47 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

491.64 496.59 B: you know just a sixty minutes or something that that tells me a little more about what's happening 

495.40 500.86 A: right like the like when you watch the court t._v. it tells you wh- it's almost like watching current events 

500.60 502.10 B: yeah yeah 

501.69 507.26 A: you know and you tune in you see what's going on and how the trial is going and from there you're stuck 

505.77 507.06 B: mhm 

507.41 516.46 B: yeah i think that if they were to to film more of that sort of thing i think that they would their audience would be much broader because i think a lot of people are interested 

514.46 516.72 A: yes it would that's a good point 

516.62 523.56 B: yeah i think a lot of people are interested in that sort of thing i mean most of what they have on t._v. now is just such garbage 

516.75 517.91 A: yeah 

523.40 526.93 A: and and people now are much a much more informed public 

526.30 527.97 B: (( yes yeah )) 

527.15 536.07 A: and they're much more intelligent and you know i don't think they give them enough credit you know that they they are smart enough to make their own decisions they don't depend on the newspapers to help them 

535.50 543.98 B: yeah exactly and and you know as we both said too when you read it in the newspaper you're getting one person's take on the event 

542.68 543.45 A: (( uh )) 

544.16 546.08 A: [mn] and do you read newspapers 

544.20 545.11 B: (( ah )) 

545.84 546.82 B: oh yeah 

546.75 548.08 A: you read it every day 

547.90 548.97 B: yeah 

548.77 553.63 A: see i i get a weekly newspaper that gives us something it's called the weekly it's called the week 

553.45 554.32 B: yeah 

553.62 567.86 A: in review and it gives a synopsis of everything like from the i watch the news every morning but then i but then i just watch every like it gives you like politics and and international local everything it gives a little bit of a synopsis of everything 

559.33 560.21 B: yeah 

565.41 566.53 B: mhm 

567.88 571.35 A: and you know then i get my rest of my information from t._v. 

571.23 584.06 B: yeah yeah well i i look at the paper read the paper every day ah i you know highlight of course the the main articles and ah there is a lot of the stuff you know that i'm really not that interested in but ah 

579.50 580.32 A: (( right )) 

583.13 584.54 A: mhm 

584.33 594.96 B: you know it's i i like i dunno i guess i like to be informed and i think that's why i would watch ah more court ah cases and more things like that 

594.85 599.89 A: yeah i think they do i think they i think the public deserves the right to to have a choice to watch it and 

594.98 596.14 B: and i do like the 

597.95 599.11 B: mhm
