82.54 83.57 A: well

89.75 91.67 A: did you catch any of that trial

93.13 94.08 A: yeah 

98.02 102.49 A: that was like ah that was like about nine years ago i think 

102.28 105.07 B: (( aw i didn't really remember exactly )) 

104.27 112.15 A: yeah 'cause i i remember ah i was just moving into an apartment i just got a new job and moving into an apartment and ah 

112.69 117.36 A: and they had the the white bronco was on television while we were moving in 

117.85 120.53 A: so that's how that's how i remember when it was 

117.95 119.60 B: that's a while ago 

120.88 126.84 B: i was i was still in grade school at same time so i had no idea 

122.87 124.06 A: yeah 

125.37 127.50 A: you probably know all about it though i'm sure 

127.52 135.04 B: yeah yeah i watched it and he was guilty [laughter] 

131.14 133.13 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

133.55 136.30 A: i think he was guilty as sin but ah 

136.33 141.31 B: actually i don't think he actually did it but i think he knew who did it 

138.57 139.72 A: you don't think so 

141.21 142.49 A: yeah he 

142.12 143.50 B: [laughter] 

142.58 149.88 A: ah he either i think either he you know like either he hired somebody to do it or he did it himself so i 

148.75 162.58 B: yeah 'cause i mean he knew an awful lot about what was going on as i remember and i was like you know i i already know that [laughter] and how did he get off 

154.65 155.72 A: yeah 

159.40 160.33 A: yeah 

161.73 162.85 A: [laughter] 

162.50 164.63 B: (( [laughter] )) 

163.26 169.25 A: that was like the the first really big you know the big time televised 

169.75 174.18 A: you know criminal trial by a a big name you know 

169.79 170.63 B: (( trial )) 

173.89 186.09 B: yeah well i mean and also they're like like should they be televised i dunno i don't think that they should be televised like that was b- because i mean 

183.87 184.88 A: yeah 

186.22 193.70 B: he was found guilty and just by our conversation here 

194.09 204.13 B: ah it shows that well we saw it on t._v. for ourselves we thought he was guilty and it completely ruined his career but 

203.02 203.92 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

204.22 208.10 B: because of our legal system which is screwed up enough as it is 

208.27 209.51 B: (( ah )) 

210.13 211.41 B: i mean 

211.92 221.42 B: like he was found innocent so technically we should treat as if he was innocent so he should be you you know what i mean like 

220.19 221.93 A: (( yeah yeah mhm )) 

221.50 227.13 B: it it it it kinda like ticks me off 'cause like i mean okay like um 

227.58 229.80 B: what happened like last year 

229.57 244.08 B: all these girls over in like california were being like kidnapped and killed and raped and all that stuff and i remember there is this one guy and i i don't remember if he was guilty or what happened but 

233.79 234.82 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh right uh-huh for like )) 

243.93 247.38 B: it was given with the five year old girl from texas 

246.83 247.71 A: (( ah a t._v. for )) 

247.49 262.22 B: and um i remember signing on to a._o._l. and don't laugh it's the most ironic thing but anyway so i was on a._o._l. and i i usually get my news from there and i had there was a picture of the guy 

262.07 269.14 B: his name and everything about him yet there's no official statement from the police 

268.61 269.57 A: (( telethon so there's )) 

269.22 279.55 B: whether he was they they just said oh it's very likely that you you know we feel very strongly about it but there was no official statement yet we have d._n._a. evidence 

275.45 276.26 A: (( absolutely )) 

279.38 288.44 B: linking him to the crime yet across every single newspaper news group whatever that dealt with anything current events 

288.29 302.63 B: he was there and he i mean automatically he's found guilty and everybody remembers that he's guilty whether he's found innocent by some absolute um you know 

294.21 295.01 A: (( no way that he )) 

302.99 315.04 B: god forsaken like things like he was in like he was on t._v. at the time that it 

309.57 310.48 A: (( could have ha- )) 

315.67 319.40 B: (( happened could have happened but )) 

319.42 325.76 B: because it was totally broadcasted you know before the police actually even made an official statement 

326.30 327.47 B: (( ah )) 

327.34 330.01 A: (( that it could possibly [laughter] ah yeah he's already guilty yeah )) 

327.52 329.50 B: he's guilty 

329.43 343.84 B: his his life is already ruined and it's the same thing with like rape and everything like that like you get accused of rape your life is ruined already it's just gone whether you did it or you didn't it's gone 

337.80 338.89 A: (( oh yeah [laughter] )) 

344.05 346.50 B: like you just have to move 

346.76 355.91 B: and like like that's basically what it comes down to and you take away their ability to move [noise] if that's televised 

355.38 356.56 A: right 

356.33 361.29 B: so i dunno if it really should be televised or not because i mean 

361.59 364.51 B: it's like they should get the same 

362.60 368.18 A: yeah well i think too i think some of these places i i think they they wait for ah 

368.34 372.54 A: for celebrities to have trials just so that they can make a few bucks off of it you know 

372.04 381.15 B: yeah i mean people i mean how many people do you think went to l._a. you know and like they're like oh the o. j. simpson trials are 

377.85 378.82 A: yeah 

381.33 395.08 B: all i mean it's just i i just feel that because and and there's so much other crap going on in this country like this country doesn't even seem like america any more 

394.66 395.53 A: uh-huh 

395.30 401.41 B: because of like the patriot act and everything that's going on i i'm a computer geek 

401.04 402.01 A: (( all right )) 

402.17 414.34 B: like right now i'm not even sure that you're aware but if if you have a router if you have like b._s._o. or cable or something like that and you have a router technically they can come in and sue you 

414.17 415.27 A: really 

414.92 426.14 B: yeah with these new laws that are being passed in about twenty four states they can just your i._s._p. or something oh well we don't like you so we're just going to sue you 

425.88 427.54 A: [laughter] 

426.84 430.60 B: whether they state it in their ah 

427.86 428.42 A: (( [sigh] )) 

430.64 436.08 B: in in their contract or not and so basically 

436.13 441.71 B: vpning and all the stuff that i like to do is technically illegal 

442.14 447.51 B: and it's absolutely harmless there's no reason why you can't route 

447.53 458.84 B: a computer you you know th- a i'm not going on anybody else's stuff actually i'm protecting my software i'm protecting my computers from the outside world 

449.50 450.78 A: (( mm right )) 

456.83 457.82 A: sure 

458.05 459.65 A: from somebody else yeah 

459.78 467.78 B: so i mean it it it's really and and actually a lot of i._s._p.s will um 

461.53 462.28 A: huh 

467.86 471.09 B: go as far as like oh i have a router i've 

471.21 479.52 B: heard of people saying oh yeah i have a router and my i._s._p. says oh yeah we don't support that but i call them up and they helped me with my router 

479.12 480.74 A: [laughter] 

480.08 487.55 B: you you know but they still use the police the chance to go and go after them 

481.07 481.95 A: yeah 

487.86 493.17 B: so like i really think there needs to be a lot done in our ah 

493.44 495.56 B: in our legal system 

494.92 495.96 A: oh yeah 

495.69 502.80 B: and perhaps starting with it would be not televising those ah 

503.10 505.11 B: court cases and stuff 

503.96 505.01 A: right 

505.53 512.77 B: but um i mean i'm not and another thing that's i found was messed up with ah the legal system is that ah 

513.47 523.17 B: i had the ah i wouldn't say the opportunity but at least it wasn't me [laughter] to help out a friend who had some legal struggle 

523.30 524.93 B: (( and ah )) 

525.49 532.25 B: i saw how messed up our legal system is you know how you get that free lawyer if you can't afford one 

531.65 532.58 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

532.37 537.29 B: that free lawyer is in complete cohorts with the judge that will judge you 

536.91 538.23 A: [laughter] 

537.71 539.91 B: so they'll make deals 

539.60 540.64 A: (( oh yeah )) 

539.93 546.14 B: that that he won't even see if you're guilty or not you're guilty already 

545.70 546.53 A: (( true )) 

546.43 555.39 B: he just makes a deal so that you get o- like get ah easier sentence or something like that with the judge that's all he does 

553.19 554.13 A: yeah 

555.46 567.46 B: you you really don't talk to him and i mean this is my one instance h- ah incident with the little thing but i mean i was like are you crazy 

566.82 568.40 A: [laughter] 

567.65 574.67 B: are you kidding me and like if i was in that predicament i would have been off 

574.21 575.15 A: yeah 

574.82 581.19 B: way i would have been like you're dead i didn't do this get me off and he would have gotten me a lawyer 

581.12 584.73 B: that would would not even an expensive lawyer 

584.58 588.13 B: like and a lawyer for like a thousand dollars 

587.89 599.89 B: which is relatively cheap 'cause just to attain some lawyers cost like ten grand and to get johnny cochrane i don't know how much that would cost but i mean 

589.67 590.86 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

596.38 597.85 A: (( yeah [laughter] ))
