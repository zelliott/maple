321.35 325.08 A: it's a habit you reach for your pocket you grab one and 

326.31 328.16 B: and it wasn't there [laughter] 

328.20 329.37 A: or two 

329.49 331.43 B: yeah yeah

340.71 341.74 B: huh 

343.58 345.36 A: so i don't know if there's more 

345.60 350.87 A: i mean after six months you know all the even the psychological 

351.57 354.05 A: (( withdraws or whatever you want to call them ))

368.78 369.97 B: (( uh-huh )) 

370.00 374.37 A: so i think it's more just a habit for reaching in my pocket and grabbing one 

374.05 375.16 B: yeah 

376.46 378.88 B: did it taste really weird when ya 

379.00 380.18 A: oh yeah 

379.03 380.90 B: when lit up again 

381.02 381.82 A: (( yeah it )) 

382.08 384.06 A: made me dizzy and 

383.63 384.92 B: really 

385.46 391.34 B: oh i had heard somebody say when they tried to stop they put a pack of cigarettes in their freezer 

391.36 394.58 B: and when you try to have it it's like really strong 

395.07 396.40 B: (( i don't know if that )) 

395.48 396.91 A: (( yeah that is i mean )) 

397.58 399.15 A: i keep my per- 

399.20 401.44 A: i keep when i buy a carton of cigarettes 

400.93 401.80 B: uh-huh

404.31 405.86 B: oh okay 

405.81 409.08 A: and so that wouldn't bother me [laughter] 

407.97 411.10 B: (( oh so it worked for you huh [laughter] )) 

410.33 412.05 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

411.83 412.91 B: oh

416.78 418.07 A: (( oh god )) 

418.51 421.41 A: probably enough to buy a car [laughter] 

420.52 422.78 B: just scaring thinking about it huh 

422.36 423.33 A: (( oh yeah huh i )) 

423.38 424.37 B: oh 

424.22 425.41 A: figure even 

426.64 428.61 A: i mean a pack a day 

429.38 431.83 A: is probably at least nine thousand 

431.21 432.18 B: uh-huh 

431.97 433.93 A: they're they're four dollars a day 

433.84 435.31 B: oh my goodness 

435.28 436.46 A: i mean i as a 

437.01 445.20 A: matter of act my wife just went in and bought two packets of cigarettes while i'm getting this phone call and it was nine dollars for two packets 

445.33 446.87 B: oh my gosh 

446.73 448.23 A: (( yeah [laughter] ))

461.71 462.44 B: oh 

463.23 464.15 B: oh 

464.98 468.63 A: but if you buy 'em by the carton you're paying about 

468.98 473.83 A: about three dollars a pack anyway from like from two ninety to three dollars a pack 

473.86 476.82 A: and when you buy 'em by the pack you pay about four dollars 

476.35 478.85 B: oh my gosh that's a pretty big difference 

478.53 480.47 A: yeah 

479.48 481.03 B: for it mm 

483.53 484.41 B: (( uh ))

513.35 514.46 A: oh yeah 

516.23 519.60 B: but maybe if i had a young child it probably would 

519.47 528.96 A: yeah i know there's a lot of people that even in a restaurant they're sat close to a smoking section and they're in a non smoking you
