28.21 29.90 B: uh okay 

31.97 33.65 A: my fault so 

33.74 37.27 A: what do you think about the whole peace issue in the middle east 

38.18 39.09 B: (( hm )) 

39.33 41.40 B: i think we very [mn] 

41.50 44.84 B: america is a kind of too pushy 

45.38 46.64 A: they're pushy 

46.36 49.10 B: yeah [mn] yes 

50.88 52.31 B: (( attack isn't )) 

52.69 56.75 B: bad but it does not mean [mn] iraq iraq 

58.59 59.44 B: (( people )) 

59.65 63.63 B: (( did [mn] these attacks so )) 

64.49 65.69 B: yeah 

66.19 78.79 A: [noise] yeah i mean i think i think they're a little pushy in a way like they should kind of let people settle their own issues and the other thing is it's like america operates with their own agenda 

68.17 69.13 B: mhm 

72.77 73.70 B: mhm 

75.66 76.56 B: mhm 

78.26 79.22 B: mhm 

78.89 92.98 A: and i mean they claim they're freeing the iraq people but they make all these accusations and it's almost like a lot of them are unfounded like they talk about the weapons of mass destruction and they've never found them it's almost like they have their own reasons to go in 

83.33 84.29 B: mhm 

88.42 89.31 B: mhm 

92.88 99.09 A: so i mean i can see where you say that they're pushy because it's almost like it's almost like they're forcing their own way 

95.89 96.64 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

98.89 99.86 B: mhm 

99.20 102.74 A: on everybody else just because they think it's right 

102.02 103.10 B: yeah 

103.05 104.31 A: so 

105.85 110.15 A: you think it will be peace you think they'll get a peaceful situation out there [noise] 

110.85 111.91 B: (( um )) 

113.53 116.18 B: now yes probably 

116.41 117.17 B: (( the )) 

117.71 120.86 B: would be better way but [laughter] okay 

120.89 124.22 B: how about this or do you think there are hm 

124.51 125.81 B: it is better way 

126.75 129.30 B: uh it is better 

129.98 131.29 B: (( than you just )) 

131.56 132.88 B: does nothing 

133.81 134.83 B: i mean 

133.93 136.64 A: do i think it's better if they don't do anything 

135.76 136.89 B: yeah 

137.19 141.03 A: well i mean i don't know i mean 

142.08 147.78 A: like the whole government was kind the whole government was messed up but 

144.13 145.06 B: mhm 

147.30 148.31 B: mhm 

147.96 153.76 A: like it's just the way america went about things they could have gone about it a better way whether it would be better off 

153.54 154.50 B: mhm 

153.86 160.51 A: i don't know it depends on how they resolve issues i mean it depends on if they force their own government in there or 

159.39 160.33 B: mhm 

160.46 172.17 A: how much the iraqi people are allowed to settle their own issues and then it depends on if they try to fight serious because a lot of people talk about problems with syria problems with israel 

164.19 165.24 B: mhm 

171.89 172.88 B: mhm 

172.16 185.70 A: so it's really a lot that has to go on i mean i don't see it being peaceful for a while simply because if so many issues and countries that that have to be tackled 'cause it's it's jordan syria iran israel it's 

180.10 181.84 B: yeah 

183.02 184.70 B: mhm mhm 

184.94 186.03 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

186.05 188.44 A: it's a lot of issues over there 

187.78 188.79 B: yeah 

191.29 191.88 A: (( [noise] )) 

192.30 193.26 B: (( um )) 

194.75 198.14 B: (( another issue is uh if [mn] there is a dictator )) 

198.76 199.74 A: there's a who 

199.55 201.35 B: dictator such as 

202.18 203.46 B: (( [mn] saddam hussein )) 

203.50 206.52 B: in some country then the u._s. 

203.56 204.48 A: (( ahah [noise] )) 

206.68 208.25 B: government should do 

208.52 209.46 B: (( er )) 

210.56 213.17 B: (( free the people all the countries )) 

213.88 217.95 B: u._s. government should fr- free all the country people 

218.34 219.71 B: (( from the dictator )) 

220.25 221.14 A: (( ahah )) 

221.43 223.04 B: that is my question 

224.53 226.86 A: you're wondering if they are going to 

226.99 229.46 B: (( for for example north korea [mn] )) 

230.08 231.19 B: (( has a dic- )) 

231.37 238.96 B: dic- dictator ruler there north korea so the then the u._s. government should free the north korean people 

233.94 234.80 A: right 

239.82 243.16 A: well hey that is another issue 'cause 

242.01 243.02 B: yeah 

243.25 252.49 A: if like if they're being choosey that's why i think that they have their own agenda like they didn't pull iraq out of a hat if they're not going to attack everyone that has a dictator 

251.88 252.79 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

252.43 261.26 A: or i mean maybe they will maybe they just decided to start with iraq but i mean whether they're going to north korea remains to be seen 

260.98 261.93 B: mhm 

261.18 268.09 A: it's just that they have a lot of [noise] issues with north korea because i mean 'cause you know north korea made all those threats 

264.34 265.49 B: oh yeah 

267.88 269.35 B: yeah yeah yeah 

269.19 270.31 A: so 

270.32 272.01 A: i mean you think that's going to be 

273.01 278.10 A: (( you think that's going to be next i mean what do you think they are going to do next though what do you think the u._s. is going to do next )) 

278.54 279.68 B: oh 

280.86 283.72 B: my question is if someone says 

283.82 289.85 B: okay this is uh country to country so there is [mn] north korea made a 

289.96 291.29 B: threat on the people 

291.31 295.74 B: (( u._s. or other country and my question is if )) 

291.53 292.35 A: (( ahah )) 

293.27 294.09 A: (( ahah )) 

295.98 303.57 B: someone says i am going to kill you does it equal to the mother or threatening 

303.76 307.42 B: is equal to mother or you know 

307.56 313.29 A: yeah yeah i understand like if they say that they're going to do it is that equal to them doing it 

313.01 313.87 B: (( ahah ahah )) 

313.89 328.81 A: and i don't think it is i mean i think it is necessary to protect yourself but i think you can go over the limit and and i mean if you go just attack them like this because they make a threat it's almost 

323.52 324.83 B: mhm 

328.66 330.65 A: (( i don't know it's kind of borderline )) 

330.89 331.84 A: (( 'cause )) 

332.86 335.65 A: i mean it's necessary to protect yourself but 

335.98 341.36 A: on the other hand they claim that you know the u._s. was being threatened and all this but they never found any weapons 

341.03 342.75 B: oh yeah 

342.21 346.81 A: yeah so it's like you know their claim that they're under threat 

346.57 347.58 B: yeah 

346.92 349.15 A: is is really questionable now 

348.97 349.86 B: (( ahah )) 

350.07 351.07 A: so 

351.80 353.17 B: yeah 

351.88 354.90 A: that's i mean that's what i think it looks like 

355.55 357.48 B: yeah 

359.36 361.30 A: what do you think will happen with um 

359.43 360.30 B: (( and ugh )) 

362.20 365.85 A: with what do you think with happen with saddam hussein do you think he's still alive 

366.53 368.63 B: what could you say it again [laughter] 

368.40 371.56 A: er do you think that saddam is still alive 

371.65 373.33 B: (( oh saddam hussein )) 

373.33 374.65 A: yeah 

374.05 375.71 B: uh 

377.20 379.54 B: (( it is very weird )) 

380.41 382.77 B: (( because uh u._s. )) 

387.60 392.44 B: [mn] they said the u._s. government said that [mn] saddam hussein 

393.20 396.81 B: went to the syria and syria government said uh 

397.03 404.00 B: if the saddam hussein came then they would expi- exterm him or something you know 

403.13 405.41 A: [noise] right right

469.63 470.48 B: (( ahah )) 

469.77 477.37 A: like it- there it's other places there's other countries that he could go to i mean they may not necessarily know that he's there you know 

473.35 474.29 B: mhm 

476.72 477.74 B: mhm 

477.83 478.88 A: so

480.64 481.81 B: yeah 

481.45 483.99 A: all you know he could be in the united states 

485.06 487.49 B: mm i don't think so bec- 

485.76 486.60 A: so 

486.71 487.86 A: i mean 

487.59 488.91 B: yeah okay

491.27 493.14 B: yeah yeah yeah yes 

492.54 498.53 A: i mean they found terrorists all over the place people that they claim to be terrorists in a lot of different places so 

495.47 496.42 B: mhm 

498.07 499.43 B: yeah 

499.22 502.90 A: i mean it's it's a big world so there's a lot of places that he could be 

502.24 503.55 B: mhm 

503.40 510.46 A: i mean they claim he's got a lot of wealth and everything so he's probably got the resources to get from one place to another 

509.83 510.99 B: yeah 

510.92 512.27 A: if he wanted to 

512.06 513.52 B: yeah 

513.46 514.47 A: so 

514.46 517.62 B: yeah probably he still has a lot of money

530.63 533.68 B: mhm yeah 

533.88 535.84 A: so he's probably still around 

535.85 537.28 B: i think so 

537.14 540.94 A: you think iraq is tied for the terrorists like al qaeda [noise] 

542.61 545.26 B: (( yeah probably )) 

545.83 547.58 B: yeah 

550.13 551.97 B: i think so yeah [sigh]

555.43 559.69 A: like i know you said the united states is pushy but do you think they're right for 

559.98 561.62 A: targeting iraq 

565.46 569.14 B: okay i don't know [laughter] 

568.43 575.04 A: i mean i mean the way they went about it might be a bad thing but do you think that they at least had the right intention 

575.78 577.67 B: um uh 

579.24 580.45 B: i have a 

583.40 587.00 B: [mn] i have a question about their motivation ove- 

587.60 590.64 B: about the attack to the iraq 

590.59 591.44 A: (( ahah )) 

591.89 593.04 B: uh 

594.90 599.89 B: (( they say that saddam hussein cared only their oil ))
