0.46 1.60 A: hi 

0.47 3.53 B: um hi ah my name's molly 

3.40 5.79 A: hi my name is marlene [laughter] 

5.19 6.72 B: (( hi marlene )) 

6.30 9.95 A: right and i and i live in minnesota 

7.53 8.34 B: oh 

9.44 14.74 B: ah i live in new york originally but i'm schooling in philadelphia 

14.17 17.81 A: okay so we're supposed to talk about the middle east today 

17.32 19.16 B: yeah fun [laughter] 

18.63 23.69 A: oh well it's better than nine eleven i think [laughter] that one was a hard one for me 

21.10 22.64 B: [laughter] 

23.06 24.23 B: yeah 

23.80 28.54 A: um i guess my feelings are i'm not sure if we should even 

28.68 31.29 A: be involved with the military there 

30.71 31.64 B: mhm 

31.77 32.87 A: um 

33.19 40.60 B: well i don't know like what do you think do you because i'm i have my own theory about it but when i talk about it people start getting very very angry 

40.06 44.53 A: yeah well me too [laughter] i just i'm wondering if 

41.42 42.88 B: [laughter] 

44.78 55.63 A: if our true reason for going in was because of saddam hussein or if it was because of the oil and saddam's mistreatment of people you know and it was sort of like being a bully 

49.09 49.93 B: mhm 

51.28 51.96 B: mm 

55.27 56.23 B: right 

55.58 60.84 A: you don't um do it the way we want we'll crush you that type of thing 

60.45 61.35 B: right 

61.26 67.90 A: so that and i i just have some feelings about that i'm not sure what we should have done or what we should do 

67.78 68.58 B: (( mm )) 

68.32 69.88 A: so how do you feel 

69.43 80.70 B: i think we got really really lucky that the war went by very quickly that the people were very willing to put their arms down and not get killed for it and that now this like reconstruction is coming through relatively smoothly 

80.70 87.50 B: we're also very lucky that it's starting to slowly get the economy and so people are starting to focus on the right things now but 

87.58 94.63 B: i think we also think we should not have gone in in the first place this is just like okay you may have won the battle but you haven't won the war kind of thing 

94.32 95.36 A: yeah 

94.72 105.73 B: because of the initial reasons that bush was even saying that we were going to go into the war was for terrorism and he still has not made any link that puts terrorism with iraq or even saddam 

104.99 113.47 A: e- exactly an- my feelings exactly um yeah [laughter] that's what i that's what i said you know sort of like a bully because 

113.65 116.65 A: i just i [noise] yeah i agree with you 

115.43 116.34 B: right 

116.73 124.32 B: it's j- just really lucky that he has very intelligent people behind him because this is basically other than a boy's whim turned into ah like oil 

124.07 125.15 A: uh-huh 

124.71 137.56 B: which i totally cannot stand that but like a- we're here we are now and we're here at the point where the so called war is over although he cannot find saddam chances are he's probably been like retired in some island somewhere be like oh thanks you've done your job 

136.68 138.75 A: [laughter] 

137.62 143.95 B: [noise] but like i think once of that now that you've started your process it's also good to finish it 

143.74 144.65 A: uh-huh 

144.10 153.63 B: so now that they're here i think yes they should do their best with helping the iraqi people instill their own kind of rule and law the way they want it and then leave 

153.22 161.86 A: [noise] right i agree um i think we need to do some help but i think we need to get out of there in a timely fashion as well 

161.37 162.77 B: agreed 

162.18 165.74 A: we don't have to push democracy or our 

165.64 166.65 B: right 

166.21 170.10 A: our thing of living on on this country 

169.71 171.06 B: mhm 

170.39 172.10 A: i don't think um 

172.13 180.11 A: i think you know the middle east well he he he he was an evil man i think you'll agree with me there 

179.50 180.93 B: yeah definitely 

180.72 185.58 A: but um let the iraqi people deal with this as best as they can 

185.26 186.21 B: i know 

186.22 187.73 A: and um 

188.15 202.07 A: the- they're sitting on this oil and i think w- they maybe need to be educated but i i think you know they were doing just fine before saddam took power and i think there's educated people over there most of them have probably been educated in the united states 

188.30 189.09 B: i mean 

198.64 199.45 B: right 

201.39 203.63 B: ha just like saddam [laughter] 

202.74 208.67 A: right exactly so we don't have to think that th- these bumbling backwards people 

208.47 209.30 B: (( mm )) 

209.66 220.29 B: yeah i know like even just to go on i remember when the war was going on where people like will they make it will they not make it and then how they were just hitting on iraqis like they were animals who jus- 

219.52 220.46 A: yeah 

220.30 230.02 B: like even i think i hear over there some stories of ah iraqis getting shot up when people are looting or trying to like get some together or there was some kind of guerilla warfare going on in between there 

230.08 242.98 B: but i think ah it's important to note that even though we've come in and we've helped these people who have been under oppression for quite a while now like every third world country although they've been under a certain condition these people still have minds and feelings 

242.28 243.96 A: e- right right 

243.28 249.77 B: so you can't go around like treating them like animals we're like okay we're going to come up here and save you and do whatever we want which i think mm 

247.99 257.83 A: right and you know even as far as the looting it should not have been done we both ah agree on that but would that not have happened in the united states as well 

257.58 258.97 B: [laughter] 

259.23 260.38 B: good point 

259.57 274.08 A: a- a- you know [laughter] y- we don't have you know we don't have to portray the whole country as being looters and all this but i think it would have happened here look what happened at the riots and how many times hasn't it happened around in the united states 

260.62 261.86 B: that is true mm 

272.46 273.33 B: right 

273.57 274.36 B: right 

274.67 287.43 B: i mean people are no different even though like we have thankfully more technology and a better period of living and many americans think oh my life is this and that but compared to other countries and the people that live there it's actually pretty well off 

274.81 275.54 A: so 

287.18 288.20 A: right 

287.62 296.26 B: and then when you start like thinking oh we're much better than them in reality you're not because a human person is a human person you can say whatever you want but you're not going to change 

295.95 300.25 A: i think that's part of the reason the united states is not well liked is our ego 

300.34 310.23 A: we go overseas we go to another country and we kind of ah quote unquote throw our weight around and think i'm from the united states bow down to me or or um 

305.88 306.79 B: mm 

308.19 309.66 B: [laughter] 

310.38 313.19 A: you know i deserve preferential treatment 

312.78 315.77 B: right i'm sort of an international person myself 

315.21 316.32 A: oh good 

316.06 324.53 B: yeah [laughter] so um i i see both sides 'cause i've lived outside america for a long time and i've lived inside america for a long time actually eight years each to be exact 

318.37 319.23 A: okay 

322.17 323.06 A: okay 

324.17 326.10 A: oh okay okay 

325.26 334.79 B: but i mean like just looking you're right what you're saying like there are americans who are intelligent they see what's going on like they're they're of the p- the point of view 

334.87 341.39 B: that like okay this is who we are but there are also other people who have their other cultures and understandings and we should respect them for it 

341.15 342.12 A: uh-huh 

341.65 351.07 B: this is really funny 'cause when i first came here like a lot of people were all about respect me respect me respect me respect me it was like a catchphrase every single t._v. show h- had the words respect in it 

350.90 351.81 A: uh-huh 

351.30 359.17 B: but like over here right now the actions that they're doing that the government is saying and how the government is representative of the population what they're doing is not respectful 

358.95 362.42 A: no i agree ah they're kind of forcing aren't they 

362.10 362.93 B: (( mm )) 

363.19 376.86 B: i mean it's just i don't know like d- ah well spoils my point i mean like just coming from the outside and coming from the inside there have been some americans who are just like oh this is who i am and 'specially unfortunately before september eleventh that was on the rise 

376.24 377.23 A: uh-huh 

376.77 380.96 B: they were totally there like going oh we don't care this that i mean there's sort of less now 

380.71 381.64 A: right 

381.04 395.10 B: b- but with this like um war being like successful and everything i really hope people won't make the mistake of starting to start being big again because those terrorist groups are still out there although they're not doing anything right now they might get irked into doing something else 

388.27 389.21 A: uh-huh 

394.47 396.93 A: you think they've kind of gone underground 

396.42 397.99 B: (( oh yeah definitely )) 

397.47 398.98 A: yeah yeah 

398.39 406.71 B: i mean i don't know what else they're doing nor do i want to but they're probably gonna wait 'til things have calmed down and everyone's like going nah nah nah again then they'll probably find some other way of doing it 

401.05 401.86 A: uh-huh 

404.61 405.44 A: right 

406.46 409.74 A: do you think nine eleven alerted us to the fact that 

409.76 411.45 A: these people are out 

411.64 415.44 A: are out there and hate the u._s. as much as they do 

416.37 418.19 B: yes but in the wrong way 

417.82 418.76 A: yeah 

418.56 420.21 B: in the beginning it was 

420.36 422.18 B: it was like it was sort of 

422.43 424.97 B: decent in that we were all thinking why 

424.66 425.74 A: mhm 

425.15 432.43 B: ah and then once we found the answer it seems that half of us didn't accept it and went the other way while the other were like oh and stopped to think about it 

431.94 432.97 A: (( mhm )) 

432.78 441.40 B: if only we had kind of like stopped to think about it more and be like well maybe we should see why as and as as we've been preaching of democracy and everything and started talking about it 

441.10 441.97 A: uh-huh 

441.58 453.78 B: then maybe that won't there would have been such a rush but at the same time with all that bloodshed going on i even spoke to someone next to me who had seen who was so close to the building that they saw the color of the shoes of the person falling off of the building 

453.27 454.64 A: oh my goodness 

454.05 459.60 B: yes it was like that bad i mean f- for that kind of thing to happen yes they had to be punished 

459.26 460.38 A: mhm 

459.77 461.20 B: but by god 

461.38 462.21 A: yeah 

462.24 468.99 B: like i- it would it will happen to them believe me but ah but the way we went around it it wasn't that good 

462.34 463.15 A: yeah 

465.63 466.48 A: yeah 

468.48 469.55 A: right 

469.69 474.31 A: so anyway i c- [mn] it's unreal to me that i found someone who 

474.32 476.96 A: who agrees with 

477.06 485.14 A: my views because out here i think i'm almost scared to admit some of these things because it's so totally 

484.73 485.61 B: (( really )) 

485.33 486.35 A: um 

486.12 488.10 B: well in minnesota i could imagine 

487.92 500.14 A: well [laughter] and you know a lot of these things don't really ah where we live i'm in rural minnesota have have no they- they- they're honest but we are [mn] relatively out of danger 

499.62 500.55 B: mm 

500.02 507.16 A: if you can understand i mean who wants to come and bomb something here there's nothing here to you know [laughter] really 

503.55 505.04 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

506.50 507.50 B: that's true 

507.55 511.38 A: so i think that has put us some people out of touch with reality 

510.87 511.74 B: mm 

512.04 518.12 A: so anyway have you um [mn] so what else were we supposed to talk about i forgot already 

513.56 514.45 B: (( that's true )) 

518.80 519.82 B: (( mm )) 

520.08 522.48 B: that's true oh my but i mean 

523.30 532.58 B: oh no it's kind of hard since you've since you're in the place where like it's supposed to be really safe and you have your communities and everyone kind of thinks along like a similar fashion 

532.92 537.48 B: and just trying to like think different from other people i think yeah i i definitely understand that 

537.14 549.74 A: mm [laughter] yeah it's it's a small rural community and i think that makes a difference but you know i i still think of this thing about the war that maybe we nee- needn't have gone in i'm glad it's over with so 

548.92 549.92 B: mm 

549.65 553.30 A: and i'm glad glad the loss of life was minimal 

552.93 553.87 B: right 

553.48 557.11 A: i'm glad the technology was there that um 

557.23 563.06 A: loss of life could be minimized an- and you know this really was a seven eight day war 

563.06 563.76 B: (( mm )) 

563.53 567.08 A: instead of four years like the previous world wars have been 

566.72 567.61 B: true 

567.65 572.17 A: and um i wasn't real pleased with the media being almost there before 

572.31 574.45 A: the rest of the people were there [laughter] 

573.84 576.94 B: yeah that also bothered me [laughter] very much so 

576.55 582.74 A: um [mn] i thought they could have kept some things separate and we didn't need to know as much as we knew 

583.68 596.99 B: mhm yeah i mean like if it was something in terms of the media that was kind of unfair and bad tha- that's what the media's supposed to be for to make sure things are equalized but then to go out and exploit every single angle just to get more ratings i think was actually disgusting 

591.03 592.07 A: uh-huh 

596.65 599.90 A: right right and you know i- i'm also one
