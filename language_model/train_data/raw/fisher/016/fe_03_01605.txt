0.00 1.79 B: hi i'm steve 

1.45 3.29 A: hi i'm rachel [sigh] 

2.77 3.87 B: hi rachel 

4.00 7.15 B: [sigh] all right have you done this before 

6.56 8.30 A: i have [sigh] 

7.48 9.65 B: okay no problem 

9.89 15.16 B: done just a f- yeah i've done a few of these like uh three or four so far i think 

9.99 10.88 A: have you 

14.83 19.19 A: oh wow you're doing a bunch i i only signed up for three [laughter] 

16.33 17.24 B: yeah 

18.27 24.23 B: i signed up for as many as they'll give me [sigh] um let's see okay airport security 

20.45 21.64 A: yeah [sigh] [noise] 

24.86 31.93 B: all right uh so the question supposedly uh airport security does it lessen our chances of terrorism in the air 

32.16 35.72 B: um [mn] i don't know what do you think 

35.10 36.14 A: (( uh )) 

36.92 39.08 A: (( [mn] yeah [sigh] )) 

38.91 41.00 B: any more to that 

39.23 39.89 A: (( just )) 

40.15 41.24 A: um 

42.06 44.08 A: yeah i think that 

44.19 58.51 A: it certainly is a deterrent and if [sigh] that's the only thing that it does is scare people a little about not taking a a risk they may have before then that's [sigh] probably enough 

59.09 60.53 A: [mn] even though if i 

60.61 68.08 A: someone really wanted to [sigh] do something like september eleventh again i think they probably could and might [sigh] 

68.20 69.00 B: (( [sigh] hm )) 

69.16 70.13 B: i prob- 

69.38 73.74 A: so i think basically domestic i think that airport security is [sigh] 

74.51 78.45 A: kind of a hassle but abroad it's probably a good idea [noise] [noise] [noise] 

78.75 82.15 B: [sigh] [sigh] i'm agreeing with that um let's see 

82.10 86.79 B: i think most of our most of the airport security we have is uh 

86.71 88.37 B: pretty cumbersome 

88.20 100.88 B: i don't know like i remember going uh trying to fly during the holidays and my parents were trying to get back from europe [sigh] and there were uh military guys with m. sixteens at the airport and it was just absolutely nuts 

100.71 109.37 B: i mean it took twenty minutes to just get through security and uh if you looked the wrong way i mean it's [noise] you know you get a strip search 

109.40 110.57 A: (( mhm )) 

109.55 110.63 B: and uh 

110.69 117.66 B: i don't know um [sigh] it seemed pretty cumbersome the people they picked as uh likely suspects was 

117.85 122.78 B: uh not didn't seem very logical to me um 

123.91 127.33 B: let's see if it reduces terrorism in the air 

127.42 140.34 B: well i'd have to think about that let's see if how do terrorists get in the air they can get in the air via a [noise] you know public jet you know that the publ- public regularly access but what if they flew their own jet 

140.43 141.42 A: mhm 

140.61 145.36 B: and uh i mean they wouldn't have to check with uh with just about anybody then 

145.38 146.21 A: no 

146.49 149.10 B: and and they could fly it and do whatever they please 

149.07 153.46 B: unless we could uh unless we had the ability to to quickly scramble [noise] uh 

153.39 165.38 B: some uh jet fighters in the air and uh blow 'em out of the sky but i mean even when the uh terr- when terrorists were heading towards the pentagon and they had totally had the option to blow them out of the sky they didn't 

165.37 173.31 B: 'cause you know they just couldn't be sure but i'm not sure if we'd take the same stance today i'm i can't i can't speak 

173.42 174.44 B: for that [noise] 

174.44 176.62 A: yeah i don't know that they would either 

176.77 179.34 A: i didn't know that they actually knew that they were 

176.90 177.71 B: did you 

179.22 180.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

179.55 182.75 A: that they thought that there might be terrorists headed towards washington 

182.73 188.91 B: yeah i don't know if if they thought so i'd think that you know that's a good enough reason to blow 'em out 

189.64 191.98 A: yeah if they lost contact with them 

192.46 198.12 A: or they weren't having any contact with the pilots or something and they know what had just happened to new york 

198.16 202.60 B: yeah yeah it's not totally unreasonable to assume that sort of thing but 

201.56 202.55 A: mhm 

203.13 205.62 B: it's a lot of trouble just to be sure 

207.04 208.68 A: yeah so um 

210.04 213.79 A: over the holidays you said your parents were coming back from europe is that where 

214.23 215.73 A: the long waits were 

215.55 230.26 B: uh [sigh] well the uh the waits to get to uh flights going to america were the problem everywhere else was just fine but uh there were uh there were u._s. guards over on the uh on both sides of the gates i mean ev- in uh in europe 

221.43 222.09 A: (( uh )) 

230.16 231.36 B: and uh 

231.79 235.57 B: here in america and that was uh a big problem 

235.16 238.27 A: mhm and were your parents american citizens 

238.17 242.77 B: a- oh yeah yeah completely they were on their uh their honeymoon 

240.18 240.97 A: huh 

242.94 244.55 B: [sigh] my pop's r- 

243.03 245.01 A: mm i haven't actually 

245.04 247.54 A: flown since september eleventh so i'm 

247.89 250.02 A: unfamiliar with how it's all gonna be 

249.96 251.34 B: yeah [noise] 

251.52 253.27 B: [sigh] let's see our 

254.29 260.62 B: i don't know i've i- are you more uh averse to uh flying since september eleventh 

260.98 265.32 A: no not really at all it just hasn't come up in my life yet um 

265.91 272.84 A: i don't like flying because it makes me airsick but i'm i'm not afr- afraid of it and i 

268.92 269.93 B: really [noise] [noise] 

273.00 274.59 A: don't know it 

274.91 278.30 A: [sigh] it hasn't really changed my view about flying other than 

279.70 283.07 A: well y- i don't know you know i since i haven't done it maybe it will 

283.34 284.99 B: hm 

283.74 287.70 A: i i'm planning a trip in in june so [sigh] we'll see how it goes 

286.57 287.63 B: (( [noise] where are you going )) 

288.11 290.29 A: we're actually going to europe so 

289.92 293.28 B: europe that sounds great sounds like lots of fun 

291.62 292.67 A: yeah 

294.14 295.61 A: looking forward to it 

296.36 297.88 B: now if uh 

298.36 307.94 B: if terrorists wanted to do some sort of air thing outside of america i'd say that they'd have just as easily uh easy free range as anywhere else but 

308.15 316.02 B: uh the uh i'm not sure how the attacks in america are gonna uh keep up right now since we're attacking most of the countries that the terrorists are 

316.10 319.27 B: coming from and all their funding is being freezed [mn] 

319.61 325.58 B: and they'll have a really hard time getting over here since we're in a uh we're geared up for war um 

324.61 332.56 A: yeah that's what i was thinking too i don't know who would even attempt it or who has the money unless it was somewhere like [sigh] south korea or something 

332.52 334.40 B: right and uh 

333.22 336.01 A: someone we weren't paying much [noise] attention to [sigh] 

335.78 338.29 B: right right um 

338.92 343.27 B: i i don- i don't think that there's uh there's much of a threat however 

343.28 347.56 B: i guess my concurrence would be uh it can still happen if they're devoted enough 

347.52 359.53 B: and if he's you know i'm wondering about how many uh how many more terrorists we're gonna have because of this war i mean how many of these uh how many young boys are gonna remember that their fathers were taken away by these bombs 

359.44 364.08 B: and uh by a u._s. bomb and grow up and be a terrorist and uh 

364.11 364.95 B: i mean 

365.01 377.62 B: [sigh] i i can't tell you how big the families are i don't know but when you cut the head of a uh hydra off and you're gonna get more coming back and i'm not sure that we can solve it by just killing them and carpet bombing them and [sigh] 

377.39 385.18 B: i mean the ones that were innocent before and came from nice families will grow up now with [sigh] kids with militant hatred for the u._s. 

385.26 392.80 B: and [sigh] we just just spawned a huge group of future terrorists with this war [sigh] and our bombing of iraq [sigh] 

385.27 386.24 A: mhm 

393.99 395.34 A: yeah i haven't 

396.70 398.60 A: [mn] i haven't been a supporter of 

398.64 403.97 A: any of our actions thus far and i continue to actively [sigh] 

405.39 407.41 A: protest against it but 

407.72 412.46 A: i haven't been watching the news in the last month so i don't even know what's happening now 

412.57 417.17 B: well that's good uh not watching the news is probably a good thing there's uh 

412.66 413.28 A: (( [mn] [sigh] )) 

417.46 421.43 B: i don't know i've watched uh a lot of fox news on the terrorism 

421.55 428.70 B: it's you you can tell that they've definitely got an agenda of things that they wanna tell you and what's going on and uh 

427.62 428.58 A: mhm 

429.94 433.44 B: [mn] it just seems it seems like a load of crap [sigh] i 

433.31 434.22 A: yeah 

433.92 438.90 B: mean i i don't remember the last time the u._s. really wanted to do anything moral like uh [sigh] 

438.82 449.62 B: take out a dicta- take a dictator out of power that we you know propped up and were friends with and helped get a uh nuclear rela- reactor from italy from back in the eighties and you know we're 

449.70 457.94 B: i don't remember us being so altruistic i have a hard time believing this war is you know because he's such a bad guy and that we're so righteous 

457.81 472.21 B: [noise] it's uh i have a lot more easy time believing [sigh] it's 'cause we wanna go in there and set up a uh set up a new government uh with uh regulators on the oil fields that we talked a little bit about who will negotiate cheaper prices for us 

472.10 473.22 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

472.86 481.42 B: i mean i find that i find that a lot more believable than we're out to save the world and uh all of a sudden iraq became a problem 

473.26 474.74 A: (( absolutely )) 

481.28 490.41 B: i mean 'cause there wasn't a problem beforehand we didn't we didn't really care before but uh we sure as do we sure as hell do care now that uh george bush junior's in office [sigh] 

490.41 492.41 A: (( [noise] yeah exactly )) 

491.16 494.32 B: i almost feel bad about voting for him but you know 

493.71 495.29 A: (( you voted for him )) 

494.86 501.19 B: oh yeah definitely he is uh we're friends with the family i mean i don't i don't agree with uh [sigh] 

497.33 498.27 A: [laughter] 

499.15 499.99 A: (( oh [noise] [noise] )) 

501.80 514.71 B: with what he's uh with what he's claiming he's doing you know i don't i don't agree with you know him saying it's for all these moral actions but if he wa- said it was to uh secure our imperialism and uh future oil reserves 

514.62 519.39 B: uh you know from hostile chaotic economies um 

520.54 525.24 B: i'd i'd probably be a lot more apt to be behind that than you know 

525.42 531.19 B: we're here to save the world and we don't like this guy and he's evil and we're righteous whatever [sigh] 

531.56 537.15 B: it's not very believable if he'd said the truth to you know a few more american people [sigh] 

537.28 539.53 B: i don't know maybe they'd be behind him then 

540.47 546.50 A: that that we're going over there and waging a war so that our oil supply will be safe 

546.23 547.99 B: right 

547.19 548.63 A: then it would be okay 

549.04 560.11 B: no not that it'd be okay but that we'd actually have some good reasoning behind it um i don't know can if we uh we're set to run out of oil in the next fifteen years 

560.72 571.57 B: so if we consume all of the world's oil in fifteen years what will we do [sigh] i'm not exactly sure the america's the largest consumer of oil i mean what do we consume like thirty million barrels 

568.95 569.92 A: mhm 

571.84 572.96 B: and uh 

573.55 579.62 B: over half and we've got seven hundred pounds of trash per person in the uh in the u._s. every year 

579.66 580.71 B: and uh 

580.92 586.83 B: we're just massive massive consumers and we've created a huge appetite machine for [sigh] oil and water 

586.71 587.76 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

586.96 596.29 B: and uh we're gonna run out so [sigh] it's not a uh renewable resource yet but it'll be interesting to see how it all goes down 

596.65 599.64 B: i think we were supposed to be talking about air 

599.14 599.89 A: yeah
