35.65 47.30 A: i mean i i personally am glad that the u._s. stepped in um and i i just don't know if if saddam is really gone i don't think he is 

46.75 48.76 B: well i don't think so either [noise] 

48.23 52.89 A: i think you know i don't think that he was that um 

52.91 57.68 A: stupid to to put himself you know in that position i guess 

56.96 58.54 B: right 

58.13 60.31 A: i think he he's smarter than that

72.08 73.36 A: yep 

74.03 82.25 B: and yes i think it was a good thing we went over there and i think it's gonna be quite a while before all that mess is cleaned up 

81.63 83.01 A: right 

82.64 89.00 B: and as long as the religious leaders continue to teach the people to hate us 

89.61 91.57 B: it's not ever gonna be over 

91.06 93.27 A: that's true i i agree 

96.41 101.46 B: so i don't know i mean this is something that's been going on for two thousand years 

100.85 104.63 A: right how is it how is it going to end now 

104.93 106.59 A: i don't see that it can 

107.87 108.87 B: well 

109.33 110.52 B: i don't either 

110.60 113.52 B: i haven't i mean i don't know what the answer is 

113.14 114.15 A: right 

114.04 115.23 B: but um 

116.97 124.73 B: i'm i think we have done what we needed to do and i just hope that we stay there long enough to take care of it 

120.18 121.48 A: mhm 

124.21 125.18 A: right 

126.43 139.98 A: and how do you think they they'll rebuild or you know how do how does the rebuilding process begin if in fact they you know they do kill saddam and i guess the top leaders 

142.14 146.63 B: ah i don't know you know these people kinda act like oh 

147.45 150.83 B: it's very understandable teenagers that 

150.90 155.52 B: mom and dad kept their thumb on them until they were old enough to get out of the house 

154.84 156.14 A: mhm 

155.71 159.83 B: and then they don't really know how to act so they try everything 

159.30 160.36 A: right 

160.41 164.09 B: i think that was the cause of most of the cause of the looting 

164.08 165.54 A: yep 

167.26 168.72 B: (( because ah )) 

168.77 173.18 B: one thing when you call it looting is a nice word for stealing

173.93 176.76 B: [laughter] 

176.83 181.83 B: and ah but i i i don't think we can imagine 

181.92 183.11 B: how 

183.97 186.97 B: poverty stricken most of these people are 

186.46 187.52 A: right

193.02 194.48 A: mhm 

193.86 196.07 B: um are no comparison 

195.72 197.41 A: to what's over there

198.04 212.74 A: yep i mean i live um about three hours from new orleans and you know we visit there sometimes and um you know see part of that i'm not the majority part but i can just imagine what it what it's like over there 

212.91 218.16 B: i can't really even fathom how i i mean i i think the 

214.99 216.10 A: mhm 

218.63 227.61 B: the ah people where say on the border towns even in mexico are in better shape than these people are 

226.92 228.09 A: right 

228.71 232.77 B: um i don't know we went to el paso three or four years ago

248.41 249.53 A: right 

252.46 254.98 B: and i think they're in better shape 

255.88 259.47 B: than a lot of the people you see over there

281.05 293.55 A: control you know what they see and what i guess teachers tell them and you know kids tell them at school so it's kind of a hard subject for them to understand but not get 

293.34 300.53 A: scared and 'cause you know they may not understand that it's away that something could happen here which i know it could 

300.18 301.19 B: sure
