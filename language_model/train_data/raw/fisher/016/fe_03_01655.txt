12.30 17.71 B: [mn] and the question of whether or not peace will ever be obtained over there i don't know anybody that can answer that one 

17.43 19.20 A: i don't think it ever will be 

19.09 23.25 B: well it's it's been a way of life for them for so terribly long 

22.98 23.69 A: (( yes )) 

23.56 27.92 B: and if you look at what's happening in afghanistan that's anything but stable 

27.75 28.61 A: right 

28.75 29.91 B: (( um )) 

30.89 33.77 A: well the middle east has been horrible for years

34.56 36.66 A: yeah [laughter] 

36.42 43.52 B: yeah i don't know i'd i would think that the show of force that we presented 

43.54 50.86 B: would cause them to at least pull back and have some second thoughts about their behaviours if george bush threatens them 

51.73 52.75 A: who's that 

53.68 58.00 B: the various middle eastern countries such as syria 

55.73 56.57 A: oh 

57.45 58.29 A: yeah 

58.16 59.53 B: with uh 

60.03 63.53 B: potential things going on there and um 

63.88 68.93 B: i know if i was one of those countries around iraqi i would certainly think twice about 

69.35 70.66 B: irritating 

70.99 73.52 B: or doing anything to 

74.41 75.75 A: upset us 

75.52 76.70 B: right

77.47 78.55 B: right 

77.84 82.80 A: yes they should and and i think the iraqis decided to give up altogether 

83.08 87.61 B: yeah well they pretty much have we've just got a few pockets here and there but 

86.92 87.98 A: yeah 

88.92 93.26 B: i don't know those those people are really they don't know how to behave under freedom 

93.34 97.76 A: well no they don't that's why they're hoping that new person that's coming in 

97.40 98.80 B: mhm 

98.12 101.34 A: maybe but they still have to get rid of saddam hussein 

101.28 102.19 B: yeah 

101.61 106.64 A: they still don't know if he's around or if he isn't around they have no proof yet 

106.46 111.25 B: well i hopefully they can at some point prove that but it could be a 

111.42 112.77 B: could be a while 

112.97 113.88 A: yeah 

114.00 119.11 A: uh i don't know if they'll ever be able to prove if he's a- well if he's alive he'll show up again 

118.79 119.90 B: yeah 

119.37 120.63 A: obviously 

120.17 127.52 B: yeah well they're starting to capture a bunch of the people that are close to him including brothers in law and sons in law 

126.99 129.83 A: right yeah they just got someone today i heard 

129.45 131.37 B: did they what did they get today 

130.90 134.16 A: er someone that's like eighteenth on the list 

135.34 139.60 B: really great i didn't hear that one i haven't had the news on for a while 

136.09 136.98 A: yeah 

139.14 140.09 A: yeah 

140.87 145.79 A: [mn] so yeah they are starting to get them but uh you know they have to get the main guys 

145.52 146.38 B: right 

147.24 148.63 A: and uh 

149.68 154.92 A: you know it could be another gadhafi where you you know for a while we didn't know what happened to him 

152.65 153.70 B: mhm 

154.66 160.00 B: right right well and um the other guy bin laden 

159.66 161.11 A: right yeah 

160.74 162.37 B: who knows about him 

161.91 164.83 A: yeah yeah he could surface again too 

165.95 166.90 B: yeah 

167.01 168.13 A: (( but uh ahah )) 

167.47 180.74 B: i think the whole thing is very frightening and i think that the muslims per se are getting a bad rap i don't think the muslim religion itself is a bad religion i think it basically is the religion of love and peace 

181.07 185.14 B: but i think that a huge huge per cent of it 

185.44 187.26 B: has has gone 

187.74 189.45 B: wacko on the thing 

189.24 190.12 A: yeah 

190.16 194.67 B: and it's you can't hardly fight 

195.25 197.90 B: a crazy religious belief 

197.93 200.09 A: no no you can't you can't 

198.41 200.30 B: (( you know there are just no )) 

201.21 202.13 B: no way 

201.88 203.91 A: the politics is what they 

204.93 206.02 B: mhm 

206.71 208.02 A: and uh 

209.93 212.79 A: it's just a shame over there er you know 

213.04 214.24 A: it's uh 

215.18 218.24 A: you know they're not educated enough to know what what's happening 

218.13 219.01 B: right 

218.63 222.82 A: too you know i mean they don't they don't even know what's going on in their own country 

222.22 223.50 B: mhm 

223.72 224.61 A: you know 

224.01 227.12 B: well i don't think they were allowed to know for a long time 

226.83 227.82 A: right 

227.42 237.87 B: the thing that really really disgusted me was when they went into some of those storage warehouses and found all this food that had been sent over under the food for oil 

237.90 238.73 A: (( ahah )) 

238.42 240.20 B: thing rotting 

240.30 241.16 A: right 

241.51 243.93 B: and not distributed to the people 

243.68 244.43 A: right 

244.35 248.82 B: all taken by the the um army and stuff 

248.35 249.10 A: yeah 

249.55 252.60 B: it's just really really sad 

249.55 250.25 A: (( yeah )) 

253.36 257.33 A: well i don't think there'll ever be you know real peace over there 

257.22 259.78 B: no look at israel and palestine 

259.49 262.50 A: right yeah there'll never be peace there 

262.10 262.98 B: no 

264.35 266.76 B: i don't know how they could ever accomplish it 

267.31 276.70 A: no no i don't think there ever will be because israel wants certain pieces of land and palestine wants land and nobody is going to give up what they have 

271.87 273.05 B: mhm 

276.41 277.42 B: right 

278.14 281.17 A: so i don't think there's going to be peace over there ever 

281.07 281.89 B: (( no )) 

281.60 283.23 A: which is a shame too 

283.32 285.48 A: because they're not large countries 

285.15 287.73 B: did you watch much of the war 

287.89 289.26 A: parts of it 

289.73 293.66 B: i tell you some of the equipment we had over there just blew me away 

293.22 294.91 A: yeah oh yeah 

294.28 297.10 B: i had no idea we had such equipment 

296.86 297.78 A: yeah 

297.67 300.74 B: such so sophisticated and 

300.80 310.72 B: and when they were in that square and that tank came up and unloaded that crane to topple that statue i thought who would ever think of a tank having a crane 

310.50 312.91 A: right yeah that's true 

313.17 314.14 B: just 

314.30 318.62 B: i tell you i i don't think i would want to be an enemy of the united states right now 

318.33 320.13 A: no i certainly wouldn't 

320.31 323.54 A: but then on the other hand i wouldn't want my son there either 

323.84 329.73 B: oh isn't that sad we've really had a remarkably low number of casualties considering 

328.89 332.41 A: [laughter] we've had quite a few in in my area 

331.78 333.67 B: have you where's your area 

333.33 334.68 A: in ohio 

334.48 335.56 B: (( ahah )) 

335.23 337.98 A: yeah there's been quite a few young men 

338.22 339.72 B: oh [lipsmack] 

338.45 340.13 A: who haven't come back 

341.30 343.04 B: so sad 

342.54 344.06 A: (( yes it's very sad )) 

344.41 348.75 A: i mean there were er quite a few groups from here that went 

348.52 349.78 B: (( ah )) 

350.82 352.53 A: you know reserve units 

352.47 359.65 B: see out here in arizona i mostly know retired people so unless somebody has a grandson or something 

359.45 363.53 A: yeah but you've got those air for you've got an air force base out there 

362.53 369.48 B: yes but that's uh that's far enough west of where we are that's probably an hour and a half from us 

364.24 365.11 A: army 

369.75 370.58 A: oh 

369.85 373.85 B: so we don't really have contact with people connected there either 

373.46 374.30 A: (( ahah )) 

374.35 377.08 B: i mean you know it's there but it doesn't 

377.54 381.66 B: we don't hear the stories of the connections and the people and things you know 

381.45 382.39 A: yeah 

382.51 385.94 A: it's just scary for the people that live around that area 

385.81 386.94 B: yeah 

386.31 390.24 A: i think which might daughter and my sister live right there [laughter] 

389.57 390.68 B: do they 

390.25 391.20 A: yeah 

391.61 392.91 B: out by luke 

392.91 395.08 A: not far from there 

394.87 396.33 B: oh my 

395.85 396.85 A: yeah 

397.75 403.02 A: so but anything within miles from there you know if something were to happen 

397.87 398.88 B: huh 

402.48 408.27 B: well we've got that huge in fact it's the biggest nuclear power plant around 

405.77 406.65 A: (( right yes )) 

407.57 408.45 A: yeah 

408.48 415.84 B: out here and i figure that would certainly make a good target i frankly have been extremely surprised by the 

415.94 418.84 B: lack of retaliatory terrorism 

418.94 422.97 A: well yeah me too but i'm thrilled by it [laughter] 

423.28 426.13 B: yeah it doesn't make me comfortable though 

425.83 426.69 A: yeah 

426.32 438.24 B: i i think they wait for to us let our guard down i i just can't believe we've split them up that badly although i think we have done some damage to the chain of command 

435.01 435.79 A: yeah 

437.25 440.70 A: well that's the important thing is to get to the top there 

440.33 442.13 B: yeah 

440.74 444.48 A: the top people the one giving you know the ones giving the orders 

444.38 445.36 B: (( ahah )) 

445.03 446.21 A: (( and you )) 

446.70 449.53 A: know hopefully we've hurt them enough 

450.55 454.46 A: that either if he's alive he doesn't have his men under him 

450.68 451.58 B: (( aha )) 

454.69 456.42 A: or he's not alive 

456.70 458.53 B: i'd i'd like to see 

459.12 463.35 B: see somebody capture bin laden i would feel so much more comfortable 

461.45 462.25 A: oh 

463.08 464.52 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

463.71 467.60 B: but he's got so many young men under him that are just as violent 

465.85 470.25 A: and i thought the israel- yeah i thought the israelis would go in and get him 

469.96 470.88 B: did you 

470.74 471.71 A: i did 

471.43 472.42 B: (( ahah )) 

472.15 476.00 A: i did if anybody could really get him i think it would be them because 

475.19 476.68 B: mhm 

476.03 479.25 A: they have an excellent secret service 

479.14 480.13 B: (( ahah )) 

480.62 482.84 A: and i really thought they would go get him 

483.33 493.27 B: i've been amazed at the number of uh terrorist attacks suicide attacks etcetera that israeli has been able to thwart 

492.89 494.55 A: yeah yeah 

494.47 499.48 B: i guess that's probably been going on over there but we really didn't hear about it as much 

498.87 503.59 A: well for a time there was there was a lot of them a lot of suicide bombings 

501.73 502.88 B: yes there was 

503.28 504.02 B: (( yes )) 

503.92 504.99 A: over there 

505.51 508.05 B: i just can't imagine a religion that 

509.33 510.86 B: promotes that 

510.37 511.14 A: right 

511.30 512.05 A: right 

512.39 516.37 B: everything is so totally foreign to our way of thinking 

516.47 517.77 A: exactly 

517.49 524.68 B: that you can't even imagine it and by the same token they can't imagine anything like we have 

524.81 527.31 A: no no i'm sure they can't 

528.52 530.12 A: [laughter] i'm sure they can't 

530.90 532.48 B: it's really crazy 

533.04 534.85 A: (( it is uh i you know )) 

533.55 544.21 B: it will be interesting to see what happens now to the oil on the reconstruction and all that i i was quite proud of the army when they came up with all those millions and millions in cash 

538.51 539.51 A: yeah 

544.76 547.25 B: and have it stashed for the people 

546.97 547.95 A: mhm 

548.59 554.59 B: and then when they took um a large amount of money here like was it six hundred million 

554.80 559.82 B: and sent over for reconstruction and and getting aid to the people 

559.28 560.05 A: right 

559.96 563.12 B: and that's from the iraqi frozen funds 

562.51 563.26 A: right 

564.46 568.12 B: so there is there's money to be had if they can just find it all 

565.85 566.73 A: (( right [mn] )) 

567.85 572.89 A: yeah well i think they need to finish up and get our guys out of there 

572.61 576.00 B: mhm i don't think you they will though for a while 

575.92 576.99 A: yeah 

576.40 579.94 B: i think you'll be peace keeping and and things for a while 

579.64 580.48 A: right 

580.37 582.29 B: but at least they won't be fighting 

582.24 583.80 A: yeah i hope not 

583.50 584.54 B: mhm 

584.41 585.69 A: (( i hope not )) 

586.05 593.32 A: er you know i- it's not fun to see it's scary you don't know what type of uh equipment they're going to use 

593.79 595.99 B: you you can't trust anybody 

595.47 596.70 A: no [laughter] 

596.45 599.89 B: the pregnant woman that came screaming out of the car 

599.47 599.95 A: yeah
