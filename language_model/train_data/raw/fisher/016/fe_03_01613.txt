0.29 1.42 A: hello 

1.23 2.54 B: hello hi 

2.25 3.18 A: hi 

3.41 4.83 A: my name's crystal 

3.69 4.60 B: um 

4.75 12.16 B: my name's manny nice to meet you [noise] i think we're supposed to talk about um what is it airport security 

6.04 6.86 A: hi 

10.26 15.96 A: if if we think heightened airport security is lessens the threat of terrorism 

15.87 18.02 B: oh what do you think 

17.02 18.12 A: uh 

19.57 32.85 A: i guess so [laughter] i don't know usually i used to hear the topic beforehand and then i could decide if i wanted to stay on the line but so oh my gosh i don't know [laughter] what do you think 

20.79 22.36 B: [laughter] 

25.02 25.95 B: uh-huh 

30.28 31.69 B: (( [laughter] )) 

32.70 46.10 B: um well i mean i guess it does a little bit um i mean it's it's l- more than more than it does that it kinda like prevents people from trying it's sorta like uh the way i see it i guess it's sorta like a gated community 

46.09 50.71 B: like i mean the gate doesn't really stop you from you know getting into the community 

48.73 50.72 A: but it's kind of a hindrance 

51.05 52.81 B: (( what's that )) 

51.61 53.77 A: i said but it's kind of a hindrance 

53.51 68.45 B: yeah exactly yeah i guess that's the way i see it i mean i think more can be done and i think it's still pretty easily i think somebody can easily still you know carry a bomb onto an airplane and proceed with it but i mean i don't know 

54.02 55.80 A: you know yeah 

68.49 69.77 A: yeah 

69.94 74.58 A: but you know they didn't carry a bomb on the n- on the nine eleven thing 

74.30 77.93 B: [noise] yeah they didn't so you mean it doesn't even take 

75.61 78.17 A: you know they used the plane as a bomb 

78.11 81.00 B: yeah so it doesn't even take that 

80.57 81.68 A: yeah 

81.88 85.60 B: i mean i guess it helps a little bit but there's still a long way to go 

85.56 86.52 A: yeah 

87.01 89.66 B: but it i guess it's a step in the right direction 

90.50 93.83 B: so what else do we say huh 

91.55 92.36 A: yeah 

93.67 95.16 A: [laughter] 

94.05 96.67 B: that's a pretty short topic yes [sigh] 

95.61 99.34 A: i know like th- that's a tough one um huh 

100.79 101.73 A: (( i don't know )) 

102.11 103.60 B: [laughter] 

102.90 104.81 A: [laughter] 

106.10 108.17 B: well that's great 

106.28 106.98 A: (( um )) 

107.70 108.81 A: uh 

109.86 112.08 B: yeah so when was the last time you flew 

112.19 117.23 A: last time i flew was probably about maybe three years ago four years ago 

117.07 118.36 B: oh really 

118.07 122.09 A: yeah so i haven't had to fly or anything like that since then 

122.37 126.54 B: [cough] no i flew out of the country like recently like about last december 

126.34 127.46 A: oh really 

127.18 133.38 B: yeah and they didn't really give me any trouble i didn't see any different and um the way the treated anybody 

133.68 134.62 B: um 

133.73 137.85 A: what was security like did they like search you and search all your stuff or 

137.52 141.39 B: no they didn't they just put me through the regular thing and we were done 

140.92 142.16 A: that was it 

141.97 147.60 B: yeah they sear- i think they randomly select different people and uh 

147.67 151.86 B: asked them to like you know put their hands up and you know search 

152.06 154.06 B: searched them thoroughly but 

153.60 154.31 A: oh 

154.49 159.28 B: but until they like random people they don't do everybody or anything like that 'cause they don't have time to 

158.97 160.34 A: well yeah 

161.71 168.52 B: so i mean if you don't get randomly picked and if you're a terrorist i guess you can still get away with it 

167.57 168.73 A: yeah 

170.42 174.86 A: i guess maybe they go by gender like like profiling kind of like 

170.53 172.12 B: (( yeah so )) 

174.64 177.02 B: yeah i think they do racial profiling 

177.52 179.76 B: um but i guess they have to 

179.83 181.40 A: well yeah 

183.24 184.22 B: um 

185.36 189.51 B: so uh is this your first time doing this or what 

188.15 190.25 A: no this'll be my third one 

190.18 191.92 B: oh really okay 

191.05 195.50 A: yeah yeah a couple of days ago we had to talk about 

192.26 193.29 B: no this is 

196.01 199.06 A: how the nine eleven thing has uh 

199.17 203.26 A: affected how you like look at life like 

202.50 207.81 B: yeah that's what i talked about last time too this is my second time doing it yeah 

204.68 205.86 A: oh really 

206.43 207.56 A: yeah 

207.95 211.41 A: (( i don't know it was a little easier topic [laughter] )) 

208.20 210.33 B: yeah 

210.45 212.83 B: yeah i guess it was a little bit easier 

213.02 215.66 A: you just kinda make it up as you go along 

213.44 214.00 B: [sigh] 

215.62 228.03 B: yeah this ones just i don't know it just seems like a yes or no kinda answer there's not much to it yes it does help a little bit and that's the end of the story 

225.24 228.15 A: yeah every every little bit helps but 

228.15 233.26 B: yeah but i don't really know how to expand on that too much 

234.45 235.41 A: yeah 

234.64 236.44 B: but 

236.87 239.75 A: kinda stuck i mean i know that like airplane 

237.10 238.98 B: (( yeah )) 

239.76 243.66 A: security would be like a big thing because of what happened at nine eleven but i 

243.91 249.39 A: i don't know but with my imagination i think of like all these other possibilities that they could do 

249.98 252.22 B: yeah definitely 

250.07 255.20 A: like like a terroristic threat you know like blowing up a major dam or something 

255.19 263.17 B: yeah they can there's a lot of things that they can do and not only that like the airplane companies are you know like losing a lot of money 'cause 

258.10 258.93 A: yeah 

262.75 265.25 A: yeah they're like almost going bankrupt 

263.40 266.36 B: it's expensive to do all this stuff 

265.98 267.08 A: yeah 

267.15 276.11 B: so i don't know if there is i mean i don't know if it's worth it for the i'm sure the companies are suffering a lot because of all the extra added protec- protection or 

276.22 282.01 A: i i saw a thing on on something on like one of those like twenty twenty or forty eight hours programme the other day 

276.28 278.08 B: surveillance or whatever 

281.19 282.14 B: (( uh-huh )) 

282.36 284.61 A: and they were talking about how like 

284.84 294.64 A: i guess in another country i forget where i wasn't paying that that sort of attention i guess but in another country they were having like um some of their planes equipped with these like um 

295.22 298.02 A: bomb detecting laser thingies 

298.04 298.98 B: (( uh-huh )) 

298.63 307.71 A: and 'cause the bombs are kinda like heat seeking or or whatever and they would seek out the plane and follow it and they had these like laser things on the bottom of the plane 

307.99 309.94 A: and it would detect this uh 

310.03 311.70 A: a bomb or something 

311.86 318.13 A: and it would like throw a laser beam at it and that would throw off the targeting device of the bomb 

318.62 319.36 A: so the 

318.63 320.17 B: oh wow 

319.37 321.46 A: so the plane wouldn't get hit 

321.25 322.74 B: yeah okay 

322.27 330.37 A: and i thought but they were talking about how you know it would cost like so many millions of dollars it would cost like a couple of million dollars per plane 

330.70 336.89 B: oh well see that's not even worth it 'cause i mean how many times has a plane been bombed with like a 

331.54 332.84 A: (( to do this )) 

335.64 341.48 A: yeah how many times is a plane itself a target i mean like the nine eleven thing the plane was the bomb 

338.46 340.35 B: yeah 

341.48 346.09 B: (( yeah so i g- i don't know if that's worth it )) 

342.18 343.11 A: (( you know )) 

346.34 352.01 A: yeah yeah that that seems a bit a bit expensive for what it's worth 

346.64 349.77 B: [cough] i think i think any way out of it is really expensive 

350.63 358.70 B: yeah yeah i mean there's no way of like r- measuring the w- worth of the lives that would be lost but then 

358.98 363.39 B: i mean some of the some of the ways to protect yourself is just not worth it 

362.96 363.93 A: yeah 

364.33 367.33 B: it's just not gonna have much of an impact 

367.38 368.44 B: so 

369.35 370.37 B: (( i don't know )) 

371.33 372.34 B: um 

373.10 377.20 B: they want let you talk for like ten minutes right [sigh] oh 

375.08 378.57 A: yeah yeah a thing will come on and tell us 

378.58 379.86 B: okay 

379.73 380.58 A: (( yeah )) 

379.93 383.58 B: all right [cough] where are you where are you t- where are you calling from 

383.13 385.44 A: i'm in fallbrook california 

385.54 387.54 B: oh okay i'm in texas 

387.21 388.79 A: oh really where abouts 

388.71 391.26 B: uh austin texas 

390.70 391.83 A: (( oh oh )) 

392.32 395.21 B: uh do you like it over there in california 

394.27 395.39 A: yeah 

395.44 397.42 B: it's pretty good 

397.71 399.79 B: [noise] oh that's good 

398.89 399.95 A: yeah 

400.05 401.01 B: huh 

402.08 407.94 B: well yeah i guess the answer's yeah and 

408.25 409.35 B: huh 

409.06 410.27 A: [laughter] 

409.87 413.12 B: [laughter] i don't really know what to say 

411.84 414.60 A: [laughter] 

415.76 425.44 B: but i just found out now that you can't actually use uh call waiting like while you're on the phone i think the last time i did it i had to use call waiting yeah so i guess that 

422.41 423.49 A: oh really 

425.52 428.21 B: voids my call from the last time 

427.53 428.47 A: oh 

428.85 432.42 A: yeah you can't yeah it's gotta be like the full ten minutes or 

432.55 434.54 B: yeah 

433.13 435.54 A: (( or you're out [laughter] )) 

436.06 437.14 B: great 

437.18 438.58 A: [laughter] 

437.33 440.07 B: well i wasn't aware of that 

440.16 443.26 B: but i just read the rules today and i don't know 

443.52 449.16 B: and every time they usually call they called like the most inconvenient times for me so 

448.29 455.41 A: yeah that's why i put down like from ten to twelve because then i know that there's only a two hour period they're gonna call me 

455.55 458.89 B: oh see i left a lot of places open 

457.88 464.73 A: a lot of yeah i i thought about that and i thought no i don't want 'em calling any old time then that way i know that 

464.83 466.83 A: between ten and twelve they're gonna call me 

467.05 468.30 B: oh 

468.04 470.13 A: so that's the best thing 

470.25 475.16 B: that's probably a better idea i should've done it like that did you refer a lot of people and stuff or what 

471.69 472.70 A: yeah 

474.79 476.46 A: (( no huh-uh )) 

477.03 481.65 B: yeah refer a lot of people i know a lot of people that actually do this 

479.44 480.40 A: yeah 

480.94 483.08 A: so do you have their website address 

483.50 484.81 A: for the 'cause 

483.60 484.81 B: do i have their webs- 

485.22 488.98 B: um yeah i do it's um 

488.78 493.03 A: i i deleted that mail i got and i totally forgot what it was 

493.01 498.56 B: oh really um let's see let me go to my computer real quick and try to bring 'em back up 

493.80 494.62 A: yeah 

496.95 497.81 A: okay 

498.24 500.02 A: okay hurry we're almost out of time 

498.70 499.64 B: um 

500.04 503.85 B: (( okay [laughter] all right just if i can )) 

500.14 501.81 A: [laughter] 

506.72 509.55 B: so is there anything else you wanna put in for this 

510.09 511.43 B: airport security 

511.52 515.69 B: (( thing )) 

511.78 512.92 A: uh 

514.74 520.88 A: no not really actually i think like the best security they could have would be like more 

516.10 518.27 B: [laughter] 

518.84 522.70 B: (( [noise] )) 

521.32 523.91 A: like security security you know like 

524.04 526.05 A: physical people security 

526.13 529.54 A: you know like like having police officers or 

526.14 527.38 B: yeah 

528.51 530.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

529.83 533.50 A: you know just people scoping out what people are doing 

533.57 534.91 B: yeah that's true 

533.67 536.42 A: i think would be the best kind of security 

535.03 535.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

537.84 542.68 B: okay i'm uh looking at the thing it has the email address has the email address 

543.35 544.91 B: and uh
