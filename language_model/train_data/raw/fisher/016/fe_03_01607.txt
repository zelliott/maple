21.40 23.38 B: so how do you feel about this 

22.92 30.97 A: ah let's see i was running water so [laughter] i missed a little bit of it it's airport security and 

29.40 34.84 B: yeah on how we feel do we feel safe enough with the airport security that that they have in place now 

34.79 35.80 A: um 

37.03 42.85 A: you know i i don't know if i am [laughter] i don't travel a whole lot anyway 

39.44 40.75 B: [laughter] uh-huh 

43.13 51.45 A: so [sigh] you know i don't know if i would honestly go on the airplane at this point 'cause anywhere that i would go i can drive 

47.87 49.18 B: [laughter] 

51.21 53.08 B: oh well that makes sense 

52.95 58.28 A: so it's like okay if i can drive and be safer then [laughter] i think i would 

56.59 59.54 B: yeah as long as my feet are on the ground right 

59.39 60.87 A: (( yeah )) 

60.03 68.82 B: well i would probably say that too except that friends of mine moved from iowa to florida and invite gave me a birthday present of a ticket to come down there 

68.85 75.15 B: so i was kind of forced to get unscarred because it was either take the ticket and go or you know use it not use it 

74.49 75.76 A: right 

75.14 88.41 B: so i did go and so i i just um i did that at the end of february so i did kind of see the security that they have in place and believe me if there's one little tiny thing wrong with you you sit in line forever 

83.12 84.48 A: right [noise] 

88.22 89.70 A: (( really [noise] )) 

88.72 92.98 B: yeah i mean not in line but you're off you know in a in a special place 

93.02 95.82 B: yeah and what was it was funny to me um 

93.10 93.98 A: could 

95.94 108.33 B: moline illinois which is not it's it's hundreds of thousands of people in the quad cities okay which is west i mean east of me but it's not big like san diego or los angeles or anything like that 

100.88 102.21 A: (( mhm )) 

107.76 108.84 A: right 

108.20 118.93 B: and believe me the security there was amazing and but it was funny because and i don't mean to be rude or anything but the three people that were sitting there were all 

118.94 121.48 B: um mid- middle eastern people 

121.10 122.24 A: right 

121.49 130.74 B: you know and so i'm sure i mean i i would think that i knew if i was one that i would be targeted anyway you know whether you're a bad ga- guy or not you look like one because you're from there 

126.08 127.25 A: right 

130.45 134.52 A: well you know and at this point sorry to say but [laughter] 

131.10 132.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

134.15 141.73 B: well yeah i mean better to be safe than sorry because who in the heck wants to i was really really really very nervous because i hadn't flown for 

134.76 136.63 A: that's just part of 

141.63 152.26 B: a long time and you know with all this stuff like you said if i was going to go somewhere i'd either drive or i wouldn't go there [laughter] but when they sent me this ticket it was like oh gosh what do i do 

142.79 143.71 A: (( mhm )) 

151.89 152.98 A: right 

152.32 162.97 B: but the security was really tight and i mean i and i know when i came back it was i went to daytona and when i went to caught fly back i had to ta- take off my shoes even 

162.20 175.46 A: [noise] [noise] i was just going to ask you did you see anything because i was one of my other things was because after they had all that high security and everything and then they somebody got in with we- he had something in his shoe 

164.44 165.62 B: mhm 

170.22 170.99 B: yeah 

174.97 179.39 B: he had ex- um um high powered explosives in his shoes yeah 

177.99 184.78 A: yeah i'm like hello okay that was one of the huge reasons why i'm like you know if that's getting by 

184.57 198.65 B: well they they make you put everything everything out on the you know either in those little trays or if it's a bag and if they see anything they put that bag back through a whole bunch of times and if there's something that they can't figure out 

191.41 192.45 A: uh-huh 

198.77 203.24 B: they'll take it over to the side and move you and they'll go through the whole bag 

202.56 204.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] really )) 

203.47 208.84 B: 'cause i watched 'em do it yeah yeah so i was very careful about what i took you know 

205.02 206.16 A: wow 

208.22 210.78 A: i was going to say i would have a little bit of 

209.40 212.87 B: you can't take razors or anything like that with you you know 

211.98 217.11 A: a i've got a titanium rod in my leg now from surgery [laughter] 

215.70 217.73 B: well see i have um 

217.82 223.98 B: doc was telling me my chiro he's got you know lots of rods and stuff in him because he was in a really bad car accident 

223.22 224.80 A: [noise] uh-huh 

224.26 230.50 B: and um he said it was a little tricky getting out to l._a. because it took him so long because he kept tripping the thing when he went through 

230.14 231.29 A: yeah 

230.65 244.40 B: but i mean it was very obvious because you can tell by the way he's so crippled up that there is you know and he told 'em and it didn't it didn't take him that long he said but you know if it would have been somebody else that would have looked different maybe it would have been you know 

243.56 245.03 A: (( right get down )) 

244.43 253.14 B: but um i was really i took i tell you i really was impressed but um and that you can't even you know like when you're sitting there waiting for your flight 

252.64 253.59 A: uh-huh 

253.21 256.54 B: um you can't even let your bag sit there 

256.34 257.61 A: really 

256.97 262.35 B: you know like if you were going to get up there's a waste basket you know just like three four five steps away from you 

261.83 262.78 A: uh-huh 

262.47 265.14 B: don't leave it sit there because if you do um 

264.83 266.12 A: you go through 

265.37 271.83 B: the security will be there immediately well no because they think somebody's got explosive in their bag and they're trying to leave it 

267.27 268.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

271.78 273.12 A: (( oh )) 

272.34 275.74 B: so you can't you ha- you can't leave your bags unattended or 

273.32 276.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] that's good then ))

277.17 278.86 A: you know i mean i 

279.10 284.88 A: i obviously i have- haven't been to an airport since all this happened so i have no clue 

284.47 289.08 B: right well see neither had i and if i hadn't gone on this trip i wouldn't have known but 

289.12 295.63 B: um but i felt you know by the time i mean the the when i first was going on in moline [laughter] i was scared to death 

295.47 296.55 A: [laughter] 

295.76 300.25 B: 'cause i kept saying i'm never going to make i know i'm going to get blown up or something you know 

300.15 312.72 A: oh you know that's i did ha- my mom had to come out last year when i fell and broke my leg and my foot because i've got three little ones and so yeah you know i do remember that i couldn't go 

306.49 307.37 B: (( oh )) 

312.66 320.03 A: in like you can only so far and this is in um burbank airport which is a very tiny airport 

313.52 314.37 B: mhm 

317.59 318.64 B: mhm 

319.43 320.37 B: uh-huh 

320.06 322.13 A: you know because i mean it's a largish

324.40 325.53 A: yeah 

324.85 333.33 B: then they go on through period you can't i mean it used to be you could go in and wait for 'em right there at the door where they come out of the plane you know no more 

331.18 343.16 A: right yeah i know we couldn't do that we actually had to wait outside next to the luggage area and even then it was very you know they were really watching everybody and stuff so 

336.57 337.48 B: right 

343.40 354.90 A: but ah yeah i i do remember [noise] that and and ah my mom i remember her saying because you know she's oh gosh what is she sixty seven sixty eight something like that 

353.26 354.29 B: mhm 

354.95 360.10 A: (( and they kept pulling her aside i'm like come on she's a little old lady [laughter] )) 

358.97 373.61 B: yeah but you know it doesn't matter i mean they just you know randomly pick people and when you stop and think about it anybody um could be paid money to do something but really what you look like doesn't really matter i mean you you you might pick some little old lady because they wouldn't look 

362.85 365.25 A: right well she kept getting picked 

367.42 368.77 A: yeah that's true 

373.75 380.34 B: they wouldn't look like anybody was going to they were going to do anything to anybody you know that would be a perfect cover for somebody 

376.55 377.75 A: right 

379.32 380.37 A: right 

380.47 390.37 B: but i do have to say that you know thinking about just getting back on a plane i don't know if i would do it or not i feel a lot better now that i went i was i was so scared 

380.62 382.08 A: well that's true 

386.18 387.13 A: yeah 

390.39 396.06 B: my girlfriend went the week after nine eleven and i told her she was out of her mind [laughter] 

394.85 400.09 A: oh no because then the security was probably so high that there's you know [noise] 

398.13 408.09 B: oh heavens it was well and the worst part about it is that see her daughter they lived out in maryland and her daughter is back out there and they were in washington d._c. the day it happened 

407.43 408.96 A: oh no 

408.22 415.98 B: yeah and so they couldn't even get back in their car because they were only about three blocks parked from the capitol 

415.45 416.48 A: uh-huh 

415.98 428.76 B: and they weren't letting anybody out of there after the pentagon got hit and she was scared to death because she thought oh my god what if they were anywhere near there you know and she was flipping out and two weeks later she's flying out there i said are you out of your mind 

419.29 420.78 A: oh my gosh 

426.04 426.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

428.67 442.02 A: yeah see i even with everything that they've got in place now i mean even l._a._x. they've actually they um when the war started they started putting in the national guard you know what are they going to do you know [laughter] 

429.86 430.84 B: (( [sigh] )) 

438.39 439.47 B: (( mhm )) 

441.15 444.50 B: shoot somebody if they have to [laughter] 

442.77 452.01 A: yeah but you know what there's still going to be crossfire there still could be a bomb you know if they really want to get through they're going to get through one way or the other they 

446.31 448.44 B: that's true that's true 

451.42 452.34 B: well 

452.32 453.58 A: (( you know the ah )) 

454.74 460.04 A: yes our our our security right now with the airports is extremely high 

459.70 460.66 B: mhm 

460.26 465.91 A: but i do think over the years they're going to let it lapse and then we're going to get nailed again and you know 

464.88 479.56 B: well you know what you could be right about that because i notice when they just they you know they get to the fighting in baghdad they get and what are they doing they take it back down to yellow again i'm like well i don't think that's a good idea just because we're done today we should change it back to yellow 

469.13 470.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

471.35 473.01 A: (( mhm )) 

479.19 482.78 A: yeah i know you know it's not like we don't have any problems 

480.57 483.76 B: yeah yeah is that a red light to say go ahead 

484.00 492.28 A: like we don't have any problems with anybody else and not like a lot of the um middle eastern people from iraq like they didn't skip over 

485.99 487.05 B: i know 

492.00 493.32 B: (( oh really )) 

492.58 494.57 A: you know hello 

493.66 498.45 B: well and now i just thought i was just reading a little bit ago on yahoo that they got the guy 

498.45 510.02 B: the um one of the son in laws the youngest daughter's husband of saddam's and he came back over from syria and turned himself in so tell me syria doesn't have anybody and they are not hiding 'em you know 

502.64 504.53 A: oh i didn't know that 

509.68 518.83 A: no i know well see and the thing is yeah let's let's drop the security at the airports because you know we have no worries 

510.48 512.80 B: oh brother these people 

515.57 516.83 B: yeah i know 

517.36 518.10 B: (( well )) 

518.65 528.51 B: on tonight it it said on the news that um they the first group of pilots just got through with their class so they're going to be able to they will be carrying if they want to they can they can carry a gun 

527.75 529.00 A: (( [noise] right )) 

528.98 538.84 B: and they were asking people on t._v. what they thought about that you know and i'm thinking well the one guy made sense because he said well you know if i was up in the air and somebody you know was flying the plane in 

538.78 546.35 B: and somebody came in to get him at least they could protect themselves yeah but yeah but you blow you blow a gun off and what's going to happen 

538.83 540.51 A: [noise] 

540.59 541.88 A: [noise] 

542.09 542.82 A: right 

545.15 550.12 A: (( [noise] the the cop pit the cockpit's going to lose its ah )) 

550.14 552.99 A: window [noise] and you're going to go down anyway 

550.79 552.14 B: exactly 

552.29 553.76 B: exactly 

553.13 555.49 A: so that's another one of my 

554.63 557.91 B: don't fly just drive [laughter] 

556.24 562.01 A: you know it's like yeah they have a right to protect themselves i totally can understand it and i can see it 

562.04 568.88 A: but then in the same sense you know what like the middle eastern people they think they're doing this for allah you know 

568.63 570.78 B: yeah they think it's right 

568.94 573.65 A: and and and they don't care they don't care who they take out they don't care how many people 

573.25 583.73 B: no because that will give them it's kind of like what's christian to get more crowns by doing the right things they get more they get the higher spots with allah because they are doing something 

575.15 576.75 A: it's the honor thing 

577.67 579.09 A: right 

582.61 584.64 A: took took out more people 

584.00 585.18 B: right 

584.74 590.63 A: so i don't know if it's necessarily better that they're having the guns in the airplanes because 

590.66 592.53 A: (( you know what [mn] )) 

592.73 593.78 A: they're 

594.90 598.65 A: they have a conscious conscience you know 

597.73 599.89 B: right that you mean the pilots 

599.52 599.89 A: (( the ))
