223.28 228.65 A: oh ways to make money with email and ways to save money and stuff like that oh 

224.83 226.38 B: yeah if yo- 

226.90 234.84 B: right yeah special deals that are going on at stores and and things like that and i just thought maybe you were from there they have quite a large ah 

230.41 231.37 A: uh-huh 

234.97 239.94 B: ah population on that that website and i just thought maybe you were from there [laughter] 

237.34 239.09 A: oh 

239.13 241.12 A: i'll have to check that out 

240.38 248.60 B: yeah it's big big savings dot com and then you can go into the forums and they different categories i mean you know for shopping and all kinds of things 

246.96 247.99 A: (( uh-huh )) 

248.23 251.98 A: (( now wh- ah ah what do you think this study is about )) 

251.72 265.47 B: ah you know i'm not sure i take ah surveys from doctor john barren also from university of pennsylvania on thursdays and ah his is always i- it's the psychology department so his are always really thought provoking 

258.46 259.39 A: uh-huh 

265.24 266.15 A: uh-huh 

265.72 269.71 B: um s- and i would imagine fisher is from the same department 

269.50 271.29 A: (( oh )) 

270.44 276.21 B: and that's what i fi- ah but i can't figure out what all the y- they ask you if you have the different telephones 

275.46 281.13 A: all this telephone business yeah i was wondering if they were monitoring like the quality of 

276.58 277.71 B: right 

280.83 281.44 B: (( i- )) 

281.19 285.19 A: of um the transmission of of the conversation or something 

284.28 290.47 B: it very well could be i don't know ah i don't know but i i feel that it comes from the psychology department somewhere 

290.16 291.18 A: (( oh )) 

290.57 294.98 B: 'cause that's really really a strong force at the university of pennsylvania 

294.76 296.82 A: (( oh )) 

296.42 297.78 B: so i 

296.94 299.09 A: but it it is kind of interesting 

298.40 300.02 B: yeah it is 

299.36 308.87 A: focus on the mode of ah plus you could make an extra fifty dollars if you were ah able to call from five different phones or something did you see that 

307.08 313.14 B: well but it's a yeah yeah but it's more it's more than that because it would be twenty five calls 

313.04 314.17 A: oh oh 

313.54 315.44 B: so that's ten dollars a call 

315.17 317.19 A: (( oh yeah )) 

316.03 318.17 B: so it'd be two hundred and fifty dollars 

317.55 318.48 A: uh-huh

556.05 556.97 B: yeah 

558.14 571.00 A: but i think that is the cause of so much animosity towards us because they are such big bullies and they're doing they do so many of the things that we tell other people not to do

570.94 573.84 A: and we just keep supporting them and supporting them
