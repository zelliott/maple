7.75 9.13 A: i'm sorry what was your name 

9.06 9.97 B: alba 

9.80 10.65 A: (( alba )) 

10.60 11.31 B: (( ahah )) 

10.95 13.04 A: oh that's a pretty name my name is barbara 

13.05 14.25 B: (( hi how are you )) 

13.83 16.00 A: i'm fine how did you get your name 

16.56 17.75 B: um 

17.08 18.46 A: it's unusual 

18.67 24.50 B: it means dawn in spanish so i guess my mum was on some kind of spanish kick at the time 

24.39 25.87 A: [laughter] 

25.24 28.74 B: all the rest of my family has uh regular names 

28.47 29.32 A: (( ahah )) 

30.31 31.23 A: um 

31.57 35.00 A: so i guess i'll let you start off on our topics 

35.07 37.94 B: (( mm the middle east well )) 

38.67 39.25 B: (( i )) 

39.76 44.25 B: i think it's a shame that we have to send people over there um 

44.26 46.37 B: (( i i guess um )) 

46.65 55.57 B: i don't know i i don't really know too much about it but in general i'd prefer that uh we didn't have to send our troops over there to be in danger 

56.45 62.09 A: well i agree i probably would prefer we didn't have to i think we did have to do you think we did have to 

62.89 73.49 B: well we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction but um i'm sure that there can be some good that it can come out of it um i it looks like the iraqis are 

73.28 78.94 B: rather happy that saddam hussein is not in power any more so that looks like one good thing that did come out of it 

78.69 82.89 A: that's true [laughter] now if we can keep the peace 

83.23 88.59 B: yes that would be good but i think that's going to be rather difficult it looks like there's 

88.79 91.57 B: that's just a hot bed of activity right now 

91.42 92.78 A: yeah 

93.87 96.04 A: well i i sure hope we can 

96.50 99.10 A: or or that someone can anyway [laughter] 

98.98 105.15 B: right you didn't have any family that uh went over did you or did you know any troops who went over 

104.96 107.07 A: no not any do you 

107.31 115.08 B: no i was just checking and i i'm so horrible with names i know there was one um private that was um 

115.14 118.06 B: taken hostage for a while was it 

118.15 120.65 B: (( jessica lynch or am i totally wrong )) 

121.17 122.85 A: jessica lynch was 

123.31 130.04 B: i'm thinking that's the name but um one of the the i was thinking of one of the female prisoners of war 

129.74 130.80 A: mhm 

130.62 132.93 B: (( [noise] and )) 

131.28 132.53 A: and you think 

132.55 134.64 A: she's one of your relatives 

134.31 140.38 B: (( no no no she's not related to me but i had heard a lot about her at the news and uh )) 

140.56 143.52 B: she had gotten her leg broken so it 

143.60 147.51 B: or or something some torture technique being used over there so 

147.71 148.72 A: yeah 

147.78 152.54 B: i think there is a little bit more to investigate in the way that uh our troops over there 

153.32 156.31 B: have been um coming into contact with stuff 

156.35 159.17 A: yes i think they don't tell us everything 

159.27 166.14 B: that's true i guess that's kind of good because sometimes i get worried that um maybe they're giving out too much information i just have 

166.47 171.15 B: this vision of the iraqis tuning into c._n._n. and to find out what's going on 

171.00 173.52 A: i know i've got the same thing 

173.55 174.48 B: [laughter] 

173.98 175.36 A: [laughter] 

176.34 178.04 A: and then geraldo 

178.31 180.59 A: you know giving away our game plans 

180.92 184.50 B: oh i didn't know about that i'm just so behind on everything 

184.38 191.31 A: well i don't see too much but that's one of the things i happened to see he kneeled down in the sand and was drawing little pictures and everything and 

190.99 194.74 B: oh that's horrible that's just the kind of thing they don't need to know 

192.23 193.49 A: yeah 

194.79 196.37 A: no no 

197.53 206.52 B: but from what i know right about now i think we just have we done everything we needed to do because i it looked like the battle part is over but that's just 

206.61 213.74 B: it's like i i catch it when i it comes on the news i don't actively seek out the information on it [noise] 

213.88 224.42 A: well i do about the same thing [laughter] [laughter] but from what i understand the battle part seems to be over but we keep getting more people 

214.02 215.22 B: so it looks oh 

215.93 217.28 B: okay 

219.85 220.71 B: [noise] 

224.94 226.84 A: you know more of the high 

226.85 229.96 A: ranking people on that deck of cards that they made 

229.72 233.34 B: oh yeah i think that was a great idea that was a great idea 

233.05 238.05 A: yeah i think so too and and it seems like every day you hear they got another person out of there 

238.50 247.99 B: [noise] it's working yeah i think that would be one thing to do like take the people in power out and then maybe things will start changing from there because it doesn't seem to be 

248.20 252.61 B: just the general people over there it's like a- an abuse of power by 

252.76 255.99 B: um the ruling party the whoever's in power 

255.82 257.08 A: mhm 

256.77 259.75 B: [noise] and uh-huh 

257.60 258.86 A: so do you think 

259.71 265.53 A: well one of the things that they said on our little recording was do you think that they'll be able to have peace there 

265.93 267.99 A: does it seem to you that they will 

268.55 277.11 B: (( i don't think so because it's like [noise] there's so much contention over even [noise] the land itself and um and there's )) 

277.09 288.61 B: there's oil over there then there's uh controversy about the holy land and the jewish and um muslim conflict over there so i- if they do it's going to take a really long time 

288.63 289.92 A: yeah 

289.93 292.20 A: yeah that's what it seems like to me too 

292.61 294.86 A: although i hope you and i are both wrong [laughter] 

295.22 304.01 B: yeah that would be great if they can achieve something over there and and everyone can come to an agreement and they could achieve some kind of stability at least over there [noise] if they couldn't 

304.02 308.43 B: get total peace maybe at least an agreement and some kind of way that they could 

308.60 310.74 B: work together on a common solution 

310.90 312.05 A: mhm 

312.43 313.38 A: yeah 

315.05 318.47 A: this is really hard to talk for ten minutes on a topic isn't it 

318.28 320.85 B: it is it is oh goodness 

320.88 330.83 B: and then it's one that i don't feel like i'm all that knowledgeable about it and i'm sure there's people who have followed it from the beginning and know probably everything there is to know but i just get bits and pieces 

331.41 335.29 A: yeah well we- [laughter] we're too much alike in that regard 

335.85 336.76 A: um 

337.53 340.69 B: but there's been coverage out there right now i was in the post office 

340.60 355.08 B: today and i i think there were some iraqis talking about how um [noise] they were upset to find out how many things saddam had in his uh palace and apparently they were over there struggling and living in poverty and he's drinking out of gold cups 

355.27 357.11 A: they didn't know that 

357.66 369.52 B: uh not according to the c._n._n. report they were surprised at [noise] at what they found because um from what i got out of the report they saw the outside of the palace but they had no idea that it was just so lavish inside 

369.53 370.93 A: oh my goodness 

369.64 371.37 B: (( and all the things they had )) 

371.26 373.67 A: well it's good for them to find out 

374.24 385.06 B: it is and it's really a shame when someone [noise] just takes all the resources of the country for themselves and has the person who's supposed to be ruling has everything and the people have basically nothing 

384.89 386.08 A: mhm 

386.09 387.71 A: and that's not good 

388.50 395.90 B: and hopefully they will find him because um from what i last heard they were still looking for him or they weren't sure whether he was dead or not 

395.60 400.08 A: i know i sure hope they find him too i don't care if they find him dead or alive just find him 

400.14 402.91 B: (( right that will be one of the things i think they will have to do )) 

403.88 406.43 B: (( kind of take him out of the equation [noise] )) 

405.80 407.54 A: mhm yeah 

408.93 411.79 A: they seem to be getting his family right and left 

412.24 415.89 B: yeah i heard that they had gotten his uh half brother i 

416.47 425.74 B: i think that's what i heard and then i guess everything is cleared up with afghanistan or [noise] maybe even starting to get cleared up because i haven't heard any more about that 

426.39 433.60 A: well that's good uh we we keep i keep forgetting about that because we're so busy thinking about iraq 

434.45 436.79 A: and then if there are any uh 

437.39 439.61 A: you know does it connect anywhere 

440.86 444.60 A: with you know with uh al qaeda and saddam 

444.67 457.05 B: right i think there i think there is and i'm hoping that it it's going to be really terrible if we don't find either saddam or osama because [mn] we need to think of the two of them uh ganging up in some kind of way 

456.99 459.31 A: mhm that's right 

461.41 462.45 A: yeah 

462.44 466.48 B: but um they have had a long history of conflict over there 

466.94 472.37 B: from what i i don't know how long it's been going on but i know i've heard about the suicide bombers even 

472.51 476.60 B: before all the conflict started with um afghanistan and iraq 

477.05 480.58 A: oh yeah the ones in um israel 

480.39 481.71 B: right right 

482.17 483.44 B: and then they 

482.25 483.24 A: mhm 

483.98 494.18 B: i don't know so not and then my geography is horrible too [laughter] so it's kind of hard i'm like okay middle east i know there's iraq over there and afghanistan and 

494.57 497.43 A: all those places seem like just a hot bed 

494.79 495.58 B: (( um )) 

497.75 498.79 B: right 

499.56 505.18 A: mm that's one place i would never be interested if i travelled much i would not want to go there [laughter] 

504.55 508.06 B: (( no no not not on my list of places to go either )) 

507.75 509.70 A: no it would be too dangerous 

512.28 517.89 B: and then i heard they looted the museum there which that's always a shame because i'm sure they lost a lot of 

518.24 520.59 B: things that were like really ancient 

520.53 523.35 A: that's really sad because gee 

523.49 526.96 A: where in the world would you find stuff as old as there 

526.89 527.94 B: right 

528.03 534.12 B: that was one of the really sad things about it but um i guess they have everything under control 

535.48 538.11 A: well good so so i guess they stopped em 

542.37 546.05 A: [sigh] i feel so dumb [laughter] 

543.05 544.51 B: (( [mn] )) 

544.65 546.07 B: [laughter] 

547.36 552.30 B: (( if i had known i would have read up on it a little bit like okay now i can i can talk about this )) 

552.66 553.84 A: [laughter] 

554.96 559.18 A: well i got a lady the other day who said i don't like this topic and she hung up 

560.56 562.76 B: hm but 

563.11 563.94 A: so 

563.49 568.07 B: i think we're we're ki- we're doing a good job we're i think we're doing everything that 

568.27 569.96 B: can be done and 

570.13 576.78 B: i'm happy to hear that uh there weren't any acts of terrorism over here while they were because i was worried about that 

576.77 580.81 A: yeah yeah i kind of thought that that might pick up during that time 

581.87 584.07 A: fortunately it didn't 

583.98 586.61 B: i think we have some good security in place 

587.43 590.72 A: i hope so have you done any travelling during this time 

591.22 599.89 B: um actually no not during this er last one i went to i flew to mexico um and
