0.00 2.17 A: hi i'm pamela in atlanta 

1.87 4.19 B: hi i'm lisa in new jersey 

3.89 7.82 A: hi i didn't wasn't paid for my last one of these were you by chance 

7.48 12.70 B: my first one was only a few days ago so i don't know this is only my second time 

11.09 13.92 A: yeah it's been a couple of months i don't know what their deal is 

14.09 20.15 A: i think heigh- i think airport security's um being heightened has helped us because i think it puts terrorists 

20.29 25.19 A: thinking that [noise] we're double checking a little bit more and makes them a little more paranoid [noise] it can't hurt in my opinion 

25.16 30.03 B: well i i think it's helped a little bit but i don't think that it's gonna prevent terrorism 

29.87 31.06 A: me either 

30.74 35.92 B: yeah no i still think there's gonna be ways for them to get stuff on a plane or 

34.92 37.61 A: [noise] especially now they know what we do [laughter] 

36.69 43.58 B: yeah they probably know everything we do and how we do it and uh you know what i don't think there could ever be enough security to prevent that 

42.48 45.40 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah back in nineteen fifty seven was when the 

45.49 48.79 A: israelis ended up putting the the armored 

48.83 62.15 A: um people there two armored guards behind a bulletproof door and then there's another door past them to the pilot and they've never been hijacked [noise] so i don't know i guess it's [noise] we should've been kinda following their lead since we're allies [laughter] 

55.15 56.23 B: right 

60.10 66.64 B: we defin- yeah the doors to the to the cockpit should definitely be bulletproof and not be nobody be able to get in 

65.86 72.66 A: [noise] yeah i'm so glad on t._v. today [noise] they said something about them having [noise] the pilots being armed now i think that's great [noise] 

70.96 74.50 B: yes i was just reading that on the computer they're gonna have guns 

72.69 73.76 A: (( were you [noise] )) 

74.22 79.04 A: yeah and they're ex military most of them anyway so i'm hoping that'll help because 

78.87 81.40 A: you know that's kinda what prevented 'em before [noise] from 

81.23 95.43 A: they were killed and stuff 'cause they weren't allowed to have a gun i have a friend that's a pilot he told me that most of 'em are ex military anyway so they know how to use a gun they're not just gonna randomly shoot through the plane i mean they don't want to kill anybody [laughter] you know so i don't understand why they didn't let 'em have it before but that's all really heightened i guess with the 

90.97 92.59 B: right right 

95.36 97.06 A: the level of the airport 

95.60 103.81 B: yeah but you know what if those doors aren't locked or bulletproof what is a gun gonna do if they're grabbed from behind are they gonna have enough time to get that gun you know what i mean 

98.84 99.90 A: [noise] 

101.42 102.16 A: (( yeah )) 

103.44 113.73 A: yeah you're right and then also if they uh basically have a hostage outside and they say hey you know we're gonna kill her if you don't open the doors [noise] what do they do let him her be killed and keep flying the plane or what 

113.17 124.73 B: [laughter] right and you know what th- the public shouldn't even know that those guys the pilots are gonna have guns because now the terrorists know they have guns and they're gonna be prepared for that too [laughter] [laughter] that should've been kept confidential 

120.97 123.27 A: yeah yeah 

124.16 134.20 A: i know they really yeah it was on c._n._n. yeah i know what you mean but i'm kinda [cough] it's kind of a pain in the butt during the holidays having to go through the lines 'cause [cough] i used to buddy pass in october and 

134.38 146.74 A: when you use the buddy pass they always like triple double check you i guess 'cause employees' friends have brought drugs and stuff on before and i was just grateful to get the flight i wasn't mad or anything [mn] but a lot of people were making big scenes on it especially the people that paid first class [cough] 

139.86 140.85 B: (( oh )) 

146.61 151.07 A: they thought 'cause they paid first class they should just be pushed through the lines and [sigh] you know 

151.04 152.71 B: hey anybody could pay for pr- 

151.32 158.66 A: like i'm sorry but pe- terrorists don't have anything to waste their money on so they could probably afford first class [sigh] not me [laughter] 

154.66 165.89 B: yeah exactly [laughter] [laughter] that's right that's right i tell you you know um a friend of mine her husband works for i._b._m. you know a a a white guy 

164.04 164.88 A: mhm 

165.77 166.56 A: uh-huh 

166.09 167.51 B: and um 

167.65 168.44 A: (( [noise] )) 

168.75 174.28 B: he travels a lot and he travels with one of his uh partners at i._b._m. that's um 

173.04 173.82 A: uh-huh 

174.35 175.47 B: like you know 

175.55 179.02 B: looks middle eastern or is middle eastern i'm not sure exactly what 

176.66 177.41 A: uh-huh 

178.07 179.90 A: does he get checked a lot 

179.68 186.57 B: no not the middle easterner my friend's husband every time they travel together he gets stopped and the other guy doesn't 

182.27 183.66 A: (( isn't that weird )) 

186.28 189.44 A: my goodness is that something [noise] [noise] 

186.94 196.21 B: is that unbelievable yeah 'cause they do them randomly it's like okay one two three okay the third one gets checked but it shouldn't be like that it should be who looks like what 

191.02 202.81 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah [cough] right [noise] you're right if i was one of them i wouldn't mind being targeted because i'd figure people would feel safer if they knew i'd been checked out 

196.71 197.84 B: (( ya know )) 

202.58 215.12 B: yeah exactly we were cracking up when he tells the story it's just so funny and he says to his friend he goes me me the white guy what about you you look like the terrorist [laughter] 

203.02 205.40 A: (( ya know i'd understand )) 

211.62 212.74 A: [laughter] 

213.04 214.61 A: really i know 

214.54 228.53 A: i know they always check us and we're like the buddy pass people that you know we're american i've got blond hair and so has my boyfriend ya know [laughter] w- we're like white and pasty we're not even [laughter] ya know looks we need to go somewhere to get a tan and they've really checked us like thoroughly [sigh] 

220.02 222.40 B: [laughter] 

222.54 224.68 B: [laughter] 

225.99 228.56 B: [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] where you from again 

228.54 237.55 A: i'm in atlanta right now but we went to hawaii in october and they had us take our shoes off and everything we [laughter] were like all right you know we were just grateful to get the cheap seats and [noise] didn't care really 

229.38 230.49 B: (( again atlanta )) 

236.40 241.36 B: yeah you know my cousin and my aunt came in from florida the same way and their feet were checked too 

241.50 256.00 A: yeah we were like wow you know there are people that really looked a lot more terroristic than we did [laughter] we weren't gonna complain we were grateful to get those buddy passes at cheap seats you know but it was kinda weird how they didn't really target what they looked like and what do those people expect if i looked like that i'd think 

245.71 246.65 B: (( mm )) 

249.22 250.73 B: yeah right mhm 

255.95 263.10 A: you know i don't know it seems to me like if they really wanna live in our country and they wanna do right by us they wouldn't mind us checking 'em a little more thoroughly 

263.47 270.44 A: b- i guess the heightened airport security and it's cost it costs like on the buddy pass thing it costs five dollars extra per thing 

270.38 279.40 A: i don't know if i'm really getting my value for my dollar on that because it seems like they had a lot of people in atlanta on t._v. that um have taken a lot of different like you know 

279.59 289.32 A: q. um like not q. tips but the um tweezers and stuff like that on the plane so it seems like they're still getting through a lot of stuff like just some of those people i guess 

288.40 291.19 B: that's what i'm saying there can never be enough security 

291.37 292.75 A: (( [noise] yeah do )) 

291.55 295.81 B: well there's always they'll figure out a way around anything that's why 

293.21 294.41 A: you feel s- 

294.84 298.15 A: do you feel safe flying i mean how do you feel about it 

297.37 298.62 B: um 

298.79 308.89 B: it's not like i feel safe or not safe i just don't let it bother me and i i i would get on a plane in a in a second that that doesn't bother me at all that doesn't bother me at all 

304.35 305.37 A: yeah 

309.30 316.57 A: i'm glad they have some security there but it doesn't seem like they've caught anybody yet you know i mean if it's just so great how come they haven't caught anyone 

311.27 312.55 B: [mn] yeah i 

314.02 315.33 B: yeah 

316.33 318.10 B: (( yeah right [laughter] )) 

316.99 320.23 A: [laughter] it seems like [sigh] but then uh maybe they're 

320.30 323.13 A: targeting the little airports now and stuff 

322.51 328.10 B: hey there was the you know they had film of uh [mn] you know the world trade center with um 

328.44 334.86 B: [mn] the guy that planned the whole thing they actually went back to tapes i guess because you know there's monitors that that were in that building 

330.26 331.15 A: mhm 

332.47 333.35 A: mhm 

334.45 335.23 A: uh-huh 

334.81 343.74 B: and they saw him like with a a video camera and he was taping like all certain spots how come they didn't catch this a few [laughter] years ago before it happened [laughter] 

338.93 340.61 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

341.19 342.77 A: (( i know i mean like )) 

342.91 350.92 A: what tourist is gonna be going and taking pictures like he was they were a tourist would be going on the top floor and taking pictures of the sights 'cause i was in that 

350.68 360.34 A: restaurant the world trade center i've been in there before it's like it had it was called windows of the world and it rotated and it turned and you would you know take pictures of like the different parts of new york you wouldn't take pictures of 

355.45 356.48 B: (( right mhm )) 

360.12 374.39 A: what he was doing like the structures and stuff it was real obvious to me when they showed the video [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah i was like wait a minute ya know he's not taking pictures of sexy women gay men he taking pictures of the sights [laughter] he's taking pictures of the fucking bottom of the building 

362.02 363.65 B: yes he was 

364.22 366.05 B: yeah you saw it too right 

369.16 370.58 B: (( yeah )) 

370.61 374.17 B: [laughter] 

374.19 380.41 B: i know i know i was like watching this on t._v. and going holy shit i don't believe it 

374.29 376.53 A: i thought that was pretty you know kinda 

377.10 377.67 A: [noise] 

379.58 391.93 A: me too i thought you know they had cameras in there i know they did because they had 'em on the elevators and stuff when you went in because i remember 'cause there was security guards when you went in ya didn't have to sign in or anything but you know as long as you had 

390.91 392.63 B: right 

391.78 397.82 A: like you were going to the restaurant and if you weren't going to the restaurant you had to pay a fee to get in or something like that [noise] but um 

395.94 404.93 B: right i just think you know no matter how much heightened security they have at the airport the best thing is to have those those those bulletproof doors just like um 

403.41 404.32 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

404.37 407.28 A: (( oh yeah [noise] like the israelis )) 

405.03 411.33 B: you know um the israeli planes the israeli airlines because they haven't had one incident since they did that 

407.55 409.91 A: yeah 

410.84 420.53 A: yeah they haven't and their pilots don't have to worry about having guns 'cause they've got two expert marksmen behind 'em with guns so they just worry about flying the plane what they should do you know 

420.02 421.74 B: mhm 

420.74 424.82 A: and then they've [noise] got these two guys that just sit there with their armored stuff and their guns on 

424.81 438.17 A: they haven't even made it through to the first set of doors as far as i'm as i've heard in the israelis you know so you'd think that obviously as paranoid as we are about everything else going on it seems like we would've followed their lead on that 

429.56 430.87 B: right 

437.50 442.52 B: you know what american airlines don't wanna spend the money but you know what maybe the government should back them and do it for them mm 

442.32 453.41 A: yeah it's true too i mean you know they're gonna probably [noise] they're gonna target anybody it's gonna be somebody called american airlines [laughter] the name but [noise] it's sad that that happened to those people 

449.34 451.47 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

453.55 455.37 A: [noise] really 'cause a lot of people 

455.18 458.48 B: and we'll still let all of them you know people come here and live 

458.08 460.24 A: [noise] oh yeah i don't understand that at all do you 

458.78 459.72 B: (( you know no )) 

460.46 474.88 A: you feel like you know why don't they do instead of heightened security why don't they do heightened measures of people getting in the damn country and staying i'm sorry but i don't think we need more foreigners here i'm not trying to be a bitch of anything but i know a lot of people that can't get good jobs i wouldn't be doing this for ten bucks if i had a great job you know [laughter] 

465.58 466.81 B: that's right 

472.77 479.64 B: mm no they took over a lot of our jobs and our businesses seven elevens gas stations 

475.27 476.89 A: (( i mean so yeah )) 

477.30 478.18 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

478.93 487.57 A: yep and then you know they'll they'll basically work for so much cheaper and under the table and not pay taxes so they're not really benefiting [noise] us being here 

487.06 491.08 B: not at all 'cause they're still m- they're still making more money here than they made in their country 

490.48 502.40 A: yeah and they don't pay taxes and it's all tax free they're [noise] illegal and stuff [noise] it doesn't seem fair [noise] i don't know i resent it 'cause i don't have i'm not a rockefeller or anything but [laughter] you know i'm not 

493.46 496.13 B: mhm yep 

501.11 505.15 B: no but ya the the point is we help everybody else and not our own 

504.70 511.92 A: yeah and we're probably the ones the more poor ones [noise] like i'm the one that like i donated blood and money to the red cross and things when this happened nine eleven 

511.62 512.71 B: right 

512.09 519.24 A: you know i know thinking a lot of those people if i was a foreigner i would've like wanted people to know how pro american i was and 

518.70 522.14 B: yeah no half of them were standing out on the streets and cheering uh 

521.99 523.12 A: yeah 

522.39 524.29 B: you know saddam [laughter] 

523.89 525.55 A: yeah you know it 

524.60 526.98 B: right in front of americans on t._v. it 

526.70 528.13 A: they make you sick 

527.88 530.11 B: does it makes you really sick 

528.40 531.99 A: they bitch so much about our country why don't they move back to theirs 

531.30 534.34 B: yeah why are they here they bad mouth us but they're still here 

534.63 544.90 A: uh i wish that i wish they would hire like folk americans to do the security checks too 'cause a lot of those foreigners if they see someone that looks like them do you really think they're gonna target themself i don't think so 

544.74 547.25 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

544.94 559.50 A: as far as the heightened security i mean i always see like hatam or abdul they're fucking checking me out and i'm going through airport security i'm thinking you look more like a damn terrorist than i do you know [laughter] my family you have a new york accent by the way are you from up there y-

569.29 571.61 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

572.66 573.97 B: i hear ya 

572.67 587.50 A: and half of them are foreigners i just don't i don't know in atlanta there are like a lot of foreigners checking us and i kinda think it's odd they're checking us and they always target me and i'm like a fat white blond ya know i don't even look the last thing like a fucking terrorist ya know [laughter] i just don't [laughter] understand why they target me 

582.02 585.52 B: [laughter] 

586.19 591.87 B: [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] you couldn't be any more american looking right
