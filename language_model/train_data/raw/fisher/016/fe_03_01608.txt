320.82 321.79 A: yeah well 

322.78 331.36 A: we're about we're about five minutes from the boarder anyway so i mean that's the big thing i mean we live almost the fartherest south that you can go

405.15 408.13 B: do you like it in colorado quite a bit or 

407.15 412.50 A: oh if it didn't snow and it had a beach it would be much better but my family is there and his family is there so 

409.39 411.66 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

411.75 414.97 B: oh yeah that kinda makes it difficult to be away 

415.43 424.35 B: yeah we lived in iowa for five years while my husband was in school and that was really different i didn't i didn't enjoy that at all i really 

416.78 417.36 A: (( yeah )) 

423.29 432.63 A: yeah well my husband's a native colorado and he was born there and other than a year when he was out here when we first got married and he was in the military he didn't 

426.63 427.84 B: mhm 

431.23 432.42 B: mhm 

432.84 434.68 A: ever live anywhere else 

434.29 435.57 B: mhm 

434.78 440.35 A: me on the other hand i didn't move to colorado until i was almost eleven it was a couple of months before i turned eleven and 

439.55 440.96 B: mhm 

440.79 448.33 A: so i remember living somewhere else although you know colorado's my home i mean i went to high school there you know i we got married there you know all that kind of stuff but 

447.03 447.93 B: yeah 

449.03 451.46 A: you know so i'm used to living somewhere else 

451.14 452.36 B: mhm 

451.67 456.46 A: but he he's not and so it's really a lot di- more difficult for him than it is for me [sigh] 

455.80 458.02 B: right yeah 

456.89 458.89 A: you know i mean my family is you know 

459.89 461.90 A: not here but you know i get along 

462.07 464.09 B: yeah that's true [sigh] 

464.42 465.62 A: but uh 

465.90 470.89 B: um i'm trying to think more about airport stuff i mean it's pretty 

470.53 474.29 A: i know those topics that are there's nothing to talk about i did 

472.12 482.25 B: yeah i had i had one about fitness i think was one of the topics and that was even harder [laughter] 

477.82 478.74 A: yeah well 

480.46 484.01 A: my my very first topic was what would you change about your life 

483.51 485.73 B: [sigh] yeah i got that one too 

484.12 484.91 A: (( you know )) 

485.34 486.66 A: and so it was 

486.73 487.67 A: um 

488.41 492.92 A: it was it was hard because both of us were like oh well we're pretty happy with our life 

492.53 493.98 B: yeah yeah 

492.97 501.40 A: so we sat there and did a lot of chit chat and w- which was nice but you never talk to the person again so you know you don't know what else to talk about then the other 

497.29 498.60 B: yeah 

501.84 509.86 A: two topics i had one was on nine eleven so that one was you know you had so much to say that our we got cut off in the middle and then i did another one on 

507.49 509.22 B: yeah 

510.95 522.92 A: something about sports i can't remember exactly it was like you know do you think that they should be able to go on strike and like basically do they get paid too much you know ty- i i can't remember the exact question they asked us but 

519.22 520.60 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

522.88 530.63 A: the lady and i just kinda talked about all these different things and we never really talked i mean we talked about the the topic but not exactly what they asked us 

525.37 527.36 B: [laughter] every 

528.42 529.66 B: mhm 

530.26 531.21 B: (( mm )) 

530.89 533.23 A: so we were kinda close and you know 

533.01 537.05 B: i wonder what they're stutter- studying i wonder what they're studying ab- 

535.97 539.81 A: i think they're i think they're studying communication i don't think they're studying 

540.34 545.36 A: what we ask about the top- or what the topic is otherwise they'd specifically say stay on the topic 

544.69 545.88 B: that's true 

545.51 551.11 A: you know i i think they're talk- they're trying to figure out how strangers communicate and 

551.54 553.75 B: that's probably what it is 

551.55 552.35 A: (( you know )) 

552.95 556.10 A: you know um different people 'cause i mean they asked where you're from 

556.16 557.06 A: so 

556.38 569.68 B: yeah i was wondering if if they were trying to do um different like uh speech patterns of different areas in the u._s. you know is 'cause a lot of different areas have different accents in a way 

563.60 564.54 A: yeah 

567.46 568.24 A: they ha- 

568.76 572.65 A: 'cause the people i've talked to i talked to one person from california 

572.06 575.72 B: i've talked to california too and uh texas i think 

573.61 575.21 A: (( who else did i talk to )) 

575.69 577.60 A: let's see california 

577.73 580.71 A: (( iowa now where was the other lady from )) 

580.91 584.47 A: you and then i can't remember now where the other lady was from 

584.71 587.74 A: but i mean i've talked to pretty much people that have the same 

587.74 599.89 A: speech pattern as i do i haven't talked to like anybody from texas or i mean that has like this big old you know southern drawl i mean which is ironic because i was born there and you know spent like five years there when i was little 

588.92 590.07 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

593.52 596.34 B: southern drawl [laughter] 

597.59 598.59 B: mhm
