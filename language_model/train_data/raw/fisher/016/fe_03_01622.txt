51.60 56.85 A: getting the u._s. in a l- lot of uh what's what's the next country

81.85 91.63 A: yeah [noise] well i guess it means not not uh turning and i'm a c- a little concerned that the u._s. has got political reasons to to put uh 

92.19 98.92 A: our our companies in there and and it's gonna get a lot of the other [laughter] countries angry but who knows what's gonna happen [noise] [noise] [sigh] 

98.61 107.33 B: yeah well i you know my biggest concern is that they're sitting there thinking that they wanna put in a democratic regime 

106.63 109.25 A: yeah but i don't think these people want that [noise] [noise] [noise] 

109.00 115.17 B: i don't disagree with you i i i don't i don't think that they know what democracy is 

114.35 115.94 A: no no and then 

115.06 126.63 B: i mean uh they don't have a history of democracy they have never lived under a democracy and uh they don't seem to be 

126.88 132.48 B: they don't seem to be open to new ideas and uh you know and let's face it 

130.51 131.97 A: [cough] [noise] 

132.80 138.69 B: uh there was an interesting article in my local paper today that said uh you know 

138.71 150.37 B: they're all arguing that they they wanna blend religion with politics and democracy unfortunately seems to requires just the opposite 

140.19 141.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

141.71 145.77 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [sigh] yeah )) 

149.68 151.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

150.56 156.98 B: you know i mean we're very strong about the idea that uh you know there should be a jep- a separation between 

157.09 158.59 B: church and state 

158.56 159.68 A: (( yeah [noise] oh )) 

159.22 160.88 B: (( and uh so )) 

160.06 161.61 A: [noise] i think um

167.19 172.77 A: oil [noise] and uh [noise] probab- to me the the way they should've gone about it is 

167.98 169.12 B: (( mhm mm mm )) 

173.05 177.85 A: sitting down and trying to discuss this instead of coming on the way they did but 

178.58 179.37 B: (( no )) 

178.68 183.12 A: [sigh] who knows if bush didn't do this so that he stays in office longer 

183.43 185.29 B: you never [laughter] 

183.48 186.94 A: you know i think he's making a mess of our economy [noise] 

186.34 198.54 B: yeah you never know what their uh motivations are except that uh unfortunately uh you know a hundred and fifty young folks have lost their lives because of this and uh 

197.70 198.82 A: yeah 

198.61 202.22 B: we don't think about that much do we except that uh ca- 

202.30 203.15 A: (( [noise] yeah [sigh] yeah right )) 

202.52 204.41 B: even even the uh 

205.47 211.63 B: the television stations aren't talking about that much any more you know in the beginning it was well we you know four 

212.00 219.64 B: you know four marines were shot today and now you're not even hearing that and then i heard today that what the marines moved out of baghdad 

219.57 220.41 A: yeah 

219.86 222.94 B: and it's been taken over by the army and uh 

223.33 224.91 B: and if the um 

225.89 231.19 B: the the protests that are going on over there are any indication they don't want us there a- either 

230.77 233.45 A: yeah yeah that's that's probably right 

232.79 238.84 B: [laughter] but we're there and i guess we've gotta finish the job looks like some of the uh 

234.88 235.60 A: yeah 

239.32 247.62 B: the language towards syria has kinda calmed down a little bit uh but then again that's the same way it started with iraq you know 

242.82 243.95 A: yeah 

247.25 248.38 A: yeah 

248.08 249.56 B: and uh 

249.92 251.90 B: they didn't do you know i 

252.48 258.11 B: obviously the u._n. didn't feel that they did a very good ca- uh d- a very good job of building their case 

259.01 262.18 B: 'cause it would've been nice had we had the u._n. backing 

261.44 263.32 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i agree [noise] [noise] 

262.82 269.42 B: to go in there and maybe that's what we oughta do let's let the u._n. 'cause the u._n. is good at that kinda stuff you know 

267.69 268.58 A: [noise] 

269.44 275.85 B: and and did you see the other thing in there that they they wanna there's five bases that they want 

276.14 278.40 B: to have access to in iraq 

278.77 281.85 A: uh-huh that that the u._s. wants or yeah [noise] 

280.29 288.50 B: yeah i think that's what this is all about i think as much as anything else i think they want a presence in the middle east 

288.73 294.69 B: where they can go in and you know and have a base there which means we're gonna have 

295.36 300.50 B: you know thirty thousand forty thousand troops there for who knows how long 

295.99 297.83 A: military there [noise] yeah yeah 

300.88 302.12 B: and uh 

301.04 302.35 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah yeah [noise] )) 

302.55 308.76 B: i don't know if they'll ever achieve their final goal of of of getting a democratic state you know as much as i 

308.93 311.72 B: saddam hussein was not a very nice man 

312.34 323.95 B: he did make one very interesting comment he said that ir- [laughter] iraq is a country made up of of various tribes and the only way you can control them is with a strong hand 

324.71 326.12 B: and you know 

326.22 334.53 B: if you think about it and i've said this to other people i don't know how you feel about this but maybe the worst thing that ever happened was the breakup of the soviet union 

334.62 340.95 B: it seems they for some reason they were able to control all this stuff by by keeping it tightly under control i mean 

340.70 347.52 A: yeah it's like a lot of people in the soviet union are not happy [noise] that they liked it before better before yeah 

346.99 354.48 B: right well look if you're not used to democracy and you're not used to a free market system 

348.65 349.66 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] yeah )) 

354.81 365.62 B: and someone has essentially [sigh] you know created a welfare state where you're given food you're given shelter you're essentially given a job why would you wanna go 

366.22 369.06 B: under some other system and and you know i mean 

368.97 372.54 A: well it's just like within the u._s. every state has different uh 

373.25 376.24 A: you know governments and setup so 

376.35 381.07 A: they do things differently in california does that mean we need to change you know [noise] 

380.45 388.73 B: that's right does it need to be different in connecticut r- right you're you know you're north of us you do things you have different laws than we have i mean 

381.53 382.84 A: same same idea 

387.79 389.52 A: (( right [noise] yeah )) 

389.64 394.76 A: [noise] [noise] the other the other thing [noise] that bothered me is when i don't know if you remember [noise] when um 

390.03 390.84 B: what 

395.24 396.71 A: giuliani 

397.42 401.58 A: the prince of saudi arabia came to give a check 

401.30 402.67 B: yeah 

402.38 407.48 A: and uh giuliani rejected it and it was kind of the the u._s. 

404.41 405.55 B: mhm 

407.54 409.18 A: made it sound like 

409.60 411.79 A: he was trying to give us dirty money 

411.44 412.49 B: right 

411.85 413.74 A: and i thought that was 

413.99 419.42 A: his way of saying that we need to look at our position in the middle east and that's why [noise] everything happened 

418.87 420.87 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

419.45 430.81 A: and the u._s. just totally ignored that and turned it around that uh he was he was almost like what he did was a bad thing and i i was kinda of disgraced at that 'cause i think that was an important moment 

430.60 432.18 B: (( yeah i hear you mm )) 

431.85 435.59 A: a lot of people didn't didn't perceive it that way but that's the way i saw it 

435.56 437.63 B: well you know um 

436.58 437.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

438.74 439.80 B: (( sort of )) 

438.77 444.47 A: 'cause obviously these people attacked us because they had a they they felt they had a reason to 

444.67 450.71 A: you know i don't think that what they did was right but i don't think what we turned around and did is any better 

446.71 447.48 B: (( right )) 

450.87 454.96 A: and i think for uh adults to try to tell their children 

455.11 458.96 A: uh don't go hit hit somebody 'cause they hit you wh- what are we doing you 

459.01 462.45 B: mm yeah it's an interesting thought i hadn't thought about it that way 

462.73 474.81 B: but uh well you know w- we we do tend to have a little bit of a bad habit of not listening to other people we think our way is the y- is the right way and the only way and uh 

475.52 477.81 B: um if someone 

477.93 483.75 B: does come up with an idea sometimes if it isn't you know it's sort of like uh not invented here 

483.46 484.51 A: (( know yeah )) 

483.91 486.28 B: syndrome if you know what i'm talking about 

486.39 493.34 B: is it you know well if we didn't invent it then it must not be right so but uh but i you know i don't know i mean y- 

494.15 497.82 B: i don't know the iraqis i i i i i 

497.86 506.22 B: i let's li- you know if we keep it at the best level and we say okay the reason that we went in there was to give these people freedom they didn't ask for it though 

504.12 504.82 A: (( yeah yeah yeah [cough] )) 

505.55 510.69 A: [laughter] i i that's b._s. because that's not why we went in there that's what we had to say because 

510.21 511.89 B: right 

510.94 514.12 A: because what if we got in there and didn't find anything 

513.91 515.54 B: well we still haven't found anything [sigh] 

514.96 517.29 A: well we're trying everything to pull 

517.64 523.90 A: these scientists out and and get them to admit that there was stuff there and maybe there was but i think 

524.11 527.10 A: they had plenty of time to get rid of whatever they had yeah [noise] 

525.91 528.90 B: yeah exactly or it's underground or 

529.01 532.43 B: it's in syria or who knows were or something 

531.66 535.63 A: oh i'm i'm sorry can you hang on one second i'm getting a phone call i'll be right back 

535.71 537.35 B: yeah
