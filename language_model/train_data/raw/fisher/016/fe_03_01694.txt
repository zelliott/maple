101.83 113.46 A: but uh but uh anyhow as far as the middle east i i n- n- i don't know how you feel but i'm glad we're there and i'm hoping they'll stay there till they get something r- at least some part of it resolved [mn] 

112.66 117.71 B: you're you said a mouthful i i i believe that too because i mean 

117.82 122.80 B: i i believe that uh oh sometime back when um 

123.81 130.30 B: oh there was a general over there and he was close to i believe hussein 

129.91 130.92 A: uh-huh 

130.93 136.79 B: and he he asked uh the president at the time was president bush 

136.42 137.36 A: uh-huh 

137.17 140.26 B: could he go in and get him and president bush told him no 

140.69 144.49 A: [noise] he didn't have the congressional authorization that was the problem 

140.81 141.99 B: he believed 

144.10 145.05 B: (( mm )) 

144.72 149.07 A: he didn't have the uh but now that we've got it let's use it let's go 

148.19 157.73 B: well yeah yeah but but the thing of it is if we had of gone in at that time we wouldn't be bothered with old hussein now see 

149.16 150.60 A: (( [laughter] right [mn] )) 

157.10 161.04 A: oh i know but uh unfortunately uh 

161.14 175.42 A: i i think it took nine eleven to really wake people up enough to to get them to the point that they understood i i mean most of america is in support of bush and i'm real grateful for that even though we've got a few idiots out here who 

171.83 172.65 B: uh-huh 

175.39 186.99 A: in hollywood [laughter] who don't comprehend that [laughter] but uh i think most of us who live in the real world do understand that there are some people who are just evil and you have to deal with that and 

176.50 177.82 B: (( right of )) 

178.05 179.50 B: yeah mhm 

185.87 187.91 B: that's right that's right 

187.27 201.99 A: if you don't and i'm so glad they put me on w- this had to have been god all the way around [laughter] [laughter] 'cause i was like you know i i when she gave me the topic i said i sure hope i don't get one of those people who's against the war 'cause i'm gonna [laughter] [laughter] i just wouldn't 

191.51 193.07 B: [laughter] 

198.88 200.34 B: well i tell you 

200.35 201.08 B: yeah 

201.04 214.70 B: well [cough] i i tell you you know i i'm i am glad that we're over there yes and i think that we needed to do something to to show them over there that we mean business i mean don't come over here 

213.09 214.00 A: yeah 

214.64 220.87 B: and kill you know three or four thousand people and then not expect us to do anything

225.32 226.53 A: exactly 

228.01 228.80 B: with 

228.99 238.06 B: airplanes and bombed over there we sure we we killed some innocent people but not as many as they have killed 

236.59 241.00 A: yeah and we were doing our best not to kill uh the innoc- we were t- i 

239.08 240.10 B: right 

240.83 246.62 A: mean president bush in their pla- the military's plan was very well thought out and they've done their best 

246.42 256.49 A: at trying to keep this to a minimum uh to hurting the the civilians but you know in any kind of war you're going to have civilian lives lost that's just the way it is 

254.04 255.57 B: that's right that's 

256.30 266.49 A: but uh there's been very little life lost overall and uh you know and and as far as there being real peace over there ever 

260.28 261.84 B: (( right mhm right uh-huh )) 

266.18 268.38 B: [cough] no there never will be 

266.70 270.61 A: until jesus comes back it's not going to happen [laughter] 

269.05 275.22 B: they're not no not until jesus comes back there will never be peace over there because you know 

271.95 273.20 A: exactly 

273.58 277.01 A: yeah because that's what the bible says and uh 

276.02 281.83 B: that's true because it's it's between the two sons and i can't remember their

421.38 422.41 B: mhm 

428.35 438.07 A: care packages going over to our troops and i had written a poem for them to let them know that th- the majority of us over here do appreciate what they're doing 

430.36 431.32 B: right 

437.64 438.71 B: correct 

438.10 451.20 A: and that we are behind them a hundred percent we're not just saying we support our troops but not our president kind of garbage i mean how can you support the troops if you're not supporting their le- commander in chief that makes no sense [laughter] 

443.95 445.07 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

448.43 449.76 B: right that's true 

450.20 451.54 B: yeah yeah 

451.18 455.55 A: but um but anyway we're just i- it just um 

456.13 463.62 A: yeah i i write children's stories and i'm starting my own line of greeting cards so i'm [mn] involved with all that but uh 

462.91 464.47 B: yeah mhm 

463.70 475.86 A: but i'm just so glad to hear somebody e- it was so nice to get somebody from texas on the phone [laughter] somebody from my home state at least that knows what they're talking about but um 

467.37 468.11 B: [laughter] 

468.29 468.98 B: [laughter] 

472.18 473.80 B: right right 

475.87 484.05 A: it's just it's hard to to get uh t- to help some of these other people understand and what's really sad is that they're just so i- 

484.35 498.77 A: i- it's selfish i'm sorry but that's basically what it amounts to is that they don't want to go over there 'cause they don't want to lose any lives well you know freedom costs it's there's a price to be paid for it and they don't want to pay any price they just want to have the 

485.85 486.53 B: (( yeah )) 

492.76 494.13 B: (( yeah yes )) 

498.63 501.89 A: the freedoms but they've gotten spoiled is what it amounts to 

500.60 502.60 B: they want their cake and eat it too 

502.72 503.59 A: (( huh )) 

503.12 507.35 B: they want their cake and eat it too mhm that's right 

504.56 510.46 A: yeah and you can't do that y- i mean not in this lifetime at least and uh 

509.10 509.91 B: and 

510.01 520.43 B: some of those you know p- like you said some of those movie stars out there you know they don't like some of the stuff but you know what it somebody ought to send them over there and let them fight a little while 

520.05 525.76 A: yeah well i mean uh one of the things that whenever i was praying about it god showed me was that 

525.56 532.41 A: the reason we're over there right now because a friend of mine and i have gone through this because she's against the [mn] war and stuff and i said 

532.20 546.33 A: we got into an argument about three weeks ago and i finally you know i wrote her a letter and i said you know the reason we're over there is because there is a lot of those people over there who've gotten saved from watching trinity broadcasting and they have been praying to get delivered from saddam hussein 

542.69 543.52 B: uh-huh 

545.80 547.45 B: (( that's right that's right )) 

546.36 560.79 A: and i said that's why we're there it's because god is answering those prayers and he's trying to help these people and you know quite honestly anybody who says they don't want to go over and help these people is just flat out selfish you know they don't to 

551.51 552.22 B: (( yes )) 

558.31 559.61 B: yes yeah 

561.20 565.52 B: do you think that hussein has been killed or captured or 

564.84 572.19 A: oh [sigh] wh- who knows i mean uh uh th- the fact that they h- haven't found his body makes me question that he's dead but 

571.56 573.04 B: mhm mhm 

572.41 573.46 A: you know uh 

573.55 580.03 A: he could be lying in wait some place or he could have escaped to a different country by now you just don't know 

578.64 581.27 B: that's true mhm mhm 

580.01 591.00 A: and uh i mean i don't think that he'll ever gain back the power that he has had because i don't think anybody would ever give him that opportunity yeah i don't think 

588.20 589.86 B: that power over there 

590.02 591.88 B: i think they don't like him now 

591.64 598.20 A: [sigh] yeah well they didn't i i don't think a lot of the people liked him to begin with the problem was is that they didn't have a way 

598.26 599.19 B: yeah 

598.46 599.95 A: to talk against him without
