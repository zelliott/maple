11.73 12.70 A: okay 

12.77 13.54 A: (( [noise] )) 

13.93 21.57 A: um well this is a lot more interesting than the topic that i had the first time i think the first time i don't even remember what it was it was much bo- much more boring 

21.01 26.54 B: yeah [laughter] yeah mine was too i don't remember either what mine was so it 

25.66 38.03 A: well they emailed last week and they said [noise] that that they had all these categories and i said gee that doesn't sound at all like what i did the last time so i'm using my speaker phone because i figure it'd be more interesting for these folks you know to get the responses to get 

37.39 38.55 B: right 

38.33 42.02 A: for getting the voice i could have picked up the phone but i assume it sounds okay 

41.64 44.54 B: [laughter] yeah it sounds fine sure 

44.32 48.33 A: (( so i don't know so what should we talk about um i guess s- saddam's gone )) 

48.14 49.52 B: (( yes )) 

49.02 53.93 A: although i i read something today that said that he they think he's still alive actually and [noise] and 

53.29 59.76 B: oh i i think he is too [noise] i ah he's gonna be um a hard one to ever get 

55.46 56.58 A: yeah 

59.56 63.07 A: (( well maybe maybe we can get him and bin bin laden at the same time )) 

62.48 72.51 B: oh goodness wouldn't that be great i mean that would just um [lipsmack] really take care of a big situation if ah if something like that were to happen 

73.88 80.21 A: (( right [noise] so i don't know what should we talk about should we talk about um will there ever be peace in the middle east so i guess i'd say )) 

80.44 81.48 A: um 

81.75 88.62 A: um be- being a new york jew i guess i would say um no not unless they blow away all the palestinians 

87.41 98.08 B: [noise] well that's just about it i- i'm not sure you know if there ever will be you know ah i just i'm i'm not sure [mn] i wish 

93.42 94.54 A: right 

97.83 102.17 A: yeah i i mean i think that the problem is that you know the palestinians have been 

102.56 103.94 A: offered you know 

104.17 106.78 A: good deals in the past that they've turned down 

106.47 112.38 B: right right yeah because ah it has been s- such a rough life for them 

112.57 123.36 B: i don't think they know anything different you know it's just [mn] that's how they've been brought up and i- i'm not sure if things will will change very much 

122.91 124.67 A: no what they they seem to 

124.73 128.45 A: [noise] want something that that's i mean their leaders 

128.30 129.28 B: right 

128.91 136.11 A: insisting on getting [noise] something that is probably not best for them and leaders would just sort of step aside 

132.90 133.86 B: right 

135.58 138.06 B: yeah that's that's true yeah 

137.11 140.71 A: whole arafat thing you know if the you know if if the leaders would just 

141.04 148.57 A: if they had different leadership in there who maybe were willing to look at it and say hey you know this is a pretty good deal you know and we won't get blown up all the time and ah 

147.93 158.35 B: right yeah i i know but you know um i think after we get out of there things will go right back pretty well like they were 

158.36 165.25 B: i- i'm it's just according to who gets in there and and ah in their leadership and and takes over 

164.86 172.35 A: oh i think you know maybe you know maybe people will be less willing to you know blow themselves up now that now that they don't have ah 

171.80 173.54 B: right that's just 

172.91 182.04 A: to to pay them you know to pay their family for doing it but i i'm sure that somebody else will step up and ah you know carry on the trust fund and stuff like that so 

181.18 187.44 B: right i'm sure yeah it's just a shame that that they're brought up like that 

187.25 196.48 B: and had a lead- leadership that that taught them that they had to do these things you know in order to survive and i- it's just sad 

197.31 198.92 A: yep um 

199.47 200.83 A: (( [noise] one second here )) 

204.71 211.71 A: [noise] i'm telling my daughter how to burn a c._d. um let's see so what else l- um i think that um 

212.66 213.36 A: (( [mn] )) 

213.57 225.35 A: and the interesting thing of course is that the u._s. having gone in after old after you know bin laden and now after hussein i think that you know it sort of gives the israelis credibility in terms of whatever they want to do 

225.01 226.77 B: (( [lipsmack] [mn] right yes )) 

226.20 231.59 A: because they can't they can no longer turn to them and say you know this is bad don't don't do this 

230.99 233.39 B: right yeah i know yeah 

233.02 242.60 A: i had that read that i- i've heard that proportionally if you take you know the number of israelis killed by the suicide bombers as opposed you know compared to the full population 

242.59 249.20 A: it it would be much higher than anything you know that was ever you know that were you know that happened on september eleventh 

249.14 250.85 B: right i'm just 

250.22 252.26 A: it's like a high percentage yup 

251.64 266.32 B: right i just hate that that we did lose some of our our boys over there and at least we got the p._o._w.s back that that they had which god i just didn't really think that we would i really really didn't think we would 

266.88 268.80 B: [lipsmack] i was so scared for 'em 

268.64 272.52 A: yeah that that was kind of strange that they all that they found them um 

270.05 271.78 B: oh my goodness 

272.49 274.12 B: i was terrified 

272.95 278.36 A: but m- maybe there's still hope right you know for [noise] for ah for some of the people in in in iraq 

274.87 276.56 B: yeah right 

277.81 279.51 B: right yeah 

279.35 282.39 A: and of course now they're not happy with the u._s. being there so 

281.74 287.00 B: no no not at all not at all hm hm no they don't like that so 

287.37 288.98 B: [sigh] i'm just hoping that 

288.28 291.24 A: the good news is that they claim that syria says that they're 

291.34 295.58 A: [noise] seeing you know that they're going to ah stop screwing around 

295.06 297.84 B: (( right yeah i just [lipsmack] )) 

297.86 299.94 B: [sigh] oh yeah 

299.30 301.38 A: (( what else shall we talk about )) 

300.48 308.32 B: [laughter] i don't know i it's good you know they said they'll come on and tell us when our ten minutes is up now before they never oh 

307.15 316.47 A: um well i've been on i have a i have a timer on my phone here at work so i've been on for six minutes and twenty seconds of which probably a minute so probably we figure we've got about five minutes or so 

316.18 317.35 B: really

320.60 321.39 B: (( oh )) 

320.64 329.75 A: ah let's see well let's see i don't i i wonder if they'll ever get rid of arafat i guess since we should go back to talking about the topic at hand right i guess we don't have to i 

329.06 337.35 B: no i don't think so as long as it's on you know ah with what had to do with iraq and stuff over there so um 

333.06 333.96 A: (( mean right )) 

337.02 338.42 A: your second call 

338.80 342.52 A: for them this is your second call on this system

346.28 352.48 A: uh this is my second call also so it's interesting i had one a couple of months ago and i just go paid last week the week before and then i got the 

347.89 348.77 B: (( mhm )) 

351.43 359.55 B: oh well see i've never even got paid yet but ah i seen on there where they said some of 'em was getting paid and stuff and so

361.77 363.08 A: okay yeah 

362.43 367.18 B: yeah it was a good little while so it was a good little while before you ever got paid too right 

366.91 368.81 A: yes yes a couple of months or so 

368.20 370.86 B: yeah see that's the way with me too so 

370.03 375.97 A: but i mean ten bucks you can't argue with it i wonder i wonder if it's our tax dollars at work you know that's paying 

375.20 376.74 B: right 

376.89 378.85 A: got to figure that somebody is 

378.21 379.90 B: that's right it 

379.06 381.87 A: has to be so it's got to be a grant from somewhere i 

381.24 382.47 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

381.89 394.87 A: actually ah i actually run a mailing list with a few hundred people on it so i sent out the r- link last week and i said you know why don't you sign up and you know and put my name down put my number down as the referral code well we'll see if i get any money out of it 

394.53 398.18 B: right yeah that's right because there is they they pa- 

397.12 405.09 A: lists where people are supposed to post great deals and you know good you know deals on line and we haven't really had any it's it's been sort of weak you know on the list 

404.86 405.96 B: yeah 

405.17 416.20 A: and plus i had told people that they couldn't post things with referral codes in them and then all of a sudden you know i'm posting this so i felt a little guilty but nobody complained which probably means that nobody reads it anymore if 

415.53 419.04 B: yeah do you get on ah the computer 

417.97 420.77 A: somebody read it maybe i'll get ten bucks out of it
