0.14 1.26 B: hello 

0.75 3.22 A: h- hi i'm kathy 

3.25 4.64 B: hi i'm brad [mn] 

4.35 7.59 A: okay and out topic is airport security 

7.46 8.32 B: correct 

8.83 10.28 A: um 

10.61 12.34 A: i guess th- they had asked wh- 

12.54 22.67 A: um do we think that do i think that airport security lessens terrorist actions in the air and i guess i don't think it'll eliminate it but i guess there's a small chance that it probably 

22.60 28.59 A: does uh lessen it to some extent so i don't mind waiting in long lines and all the 

28.19 29.22 B: mhm 

28.63 30.74 A: the stuff that's going on in airports 

31.01 41.55 B: ((  )) 

31.04 31.76 A: (( how about )) 

36.70 37.58 A: mhm 

39.16 40.41 A: (( mhm )) 

41.39 51.20 B: ((  )) 

46.85 47.95 A: (( mhm )) 

50.56 51.49 A: (( mhm )) 

51.53 62.49 B: ((  )) 

63.27 67.23 B: (( help get in baggage or something's kinda doesn't make much sense )) 

65.70 66.70 A: (( mhm )) 

66.82 70.65 A: yeah no i agree i think that i i've i don't fly a lot for 

70.50 83.41 A: business any more um i used to but i know that people that fly like every day or every week day they they're they didn't like the airport security measures they were it took too long to stand in line and so forth but their attitude's changed a little bit especially after september eleventh when 

78.68 79.70 B: (( i'm right )) 

82.89 83.64 B: (( now )) 

83.34 91.64 A: when that happened and people are like i don't mind the security issues um you know having to wait in line and stuff as much so [mn] i think that helps us realise how 

91.63 100.19 A: the the need for security and helped us not really mind so much uh standing in line and all the [sigh] the stuff that goes on 

99.50 100.20 B: (( in )) 

100.94 102.95 A: yeah i know i was at the airport 

103.19 107.97 A: uh about a year or so ago i saw someone uh one woman was wearing like high heeled boots or something and 

107.86 120.13 A: they w- she had to take off her shoes because they they i guess they had a m- metal plate in the soles or something and you know she was wearing boots and tight pants and she practically you know you she had to go into the bathroom and take the pants off so that she could get the long boots off and all that 

120.02 127.67 A: you know and so she was complaining about that but i i think that's just she just wasn't dressed appropriately if you know that that's potentially going to happen you don't 

127.60 137.41 A: dress in that manner so i think as long as they let us know what the security measures are and what we can do to make things easier at the checkpoints that that's you know i don't have a problem with that 

136.96 137.78 B: (( spokane )) 

138.63 143.15 B: (( washington for college but portland oregon for home um spokane has an )) 

142.70 144.14 A: (( mhm )) 

143.29 145.99 B: (( airport that it's an international one but )) 

144.30 145.19 A: (( mhm )) 

145.78 146.71 A: (( mhm )) 

147.35 153.71 B: (( it's pretty small but the portland airport's my home airport i call it and it's pretty big international airport )) 

153.76 155.23 B: (( so okay yep )) 

154.43 155.44 A: mhm 

155.83 163.24 A: yeah that's that's true yeah although i guess they still do um there was a news story recently that i saw where they talked about 

157.85 158.92 B: mhm 

163.11 178.04 A: the number of things that are confiscated at the airport checkpoints and people would just forgot forget that in their purse or in their bag that they were carrying like a fingernail file or something that they didn't realise was prohibitive that but that that was considered a sharp object or a metal object that 

177.88 181.61 A: was potentially bad and they were saying they just you know 

181.47 193.44 A: collected tons of stuff and they were donating it to charity [laughter] be- you know because people i mean i guess people could have it mailed to them but the- you have to pay for the postage and people didn't want to wait around and fill out forms and all that stuff 

183.67 184.68 B: mhm 

186.10 187.24 B: yeah 

191.86 192.69 B: (( mm )) 

192.81 198.20 B: ((  )) 

197.80 209.83 A: well that's true that's very true yeah yeah um i can't think when they say airport security i can't think of other stuff oh i guess one thing is if when if i pick if i'm picking someone up at the airport one of the things they're doing is they're not letting you 

210.22 218.89 A: like p- pull up and park next to the curb so if i if i know someone's coming and i s- you know i say rather than having to park and pay the parking lot fee and all that and um 

218.11 218.78 B: (( so )) 

218.95 230.60 A: and i can say just meet i'll i'll be there around three thirty and if they they get off the plane and they call and say i'm here and and i go to the airport and i say i'll pick you up in front of like the south west gate um 

230.59 239.74 A: i i sometimes it's blocked off and they they they have police out in front and they don't want cars stopping there and they won't really let you stop even for a minute to l- to let someone jump in the car with you 

239.54 240.51 B: (( no longer )) 

239.84 248.96 A: that's kind of annoying i like the idea of being able to pick someone up at you know not having to park and go into the building i like being able to just meet someone at the curb and so i still think they should allow 

249.16 257.74 A: people to kind of like hang out at the curb not for a long period of time but for a a minute or two so that someone can see that you're there and get in the car but that was 

256.70 260.68 B: (( like actually on the flight you can't have a line forming from the bathroom any )) 

260.03 260.88 A: (( mhm mm )) 

261.07 269.81 B: (( more yeah so like if there's somebody in the lavatory they have that little light on the ceiling and you can't stand up unless you need to just stretch or something you )) 

265.88 268.77 A: yeah no that's not yeah yeah 

269.88 272.74 B: (( they're getting you can't just walk around like you used to if you need to stretch )) 

272.56 275.02 A: yeah yeah what city are you in 

273.69 274.83 B: (( or anything )) 

275.41 277.23 A: what airport what city are you in 

277.54 280.84 B: (( any more yeah makes it bad for long )) 

279.68 280.41 A: okay 

280.53 281.75 A: is is there 

280.89 282.49 B: (( flights [laughter] mhm )) 

282.17 284.92 A: okay so is there like a large airport in spokane 

285.50 293.45 B: (( yeah maybe if you let the airline know in advance for medical they might allow )) 

290.03 291.01 A: (( oh okay )) 

293.03 293.76 A: (( oh it's )) 

294.12 296.73 B: (( it but not sure about if you don't )) 

296.07 305.19 A: it is okay 'cause i live in phoenix and we have a fairly large airport with something like three separate terminals and things but um you you can get in and out pretty quickly and uh 

298.64 299.60 B: (( let )) 

305.23 314.42 A: and it seems like um the security precautions that right after september eleventh they were a little stricter now people seem to be get- be able to get on and off the plane 

314.66 327.75 A: um and it doesn't like take quite as long but they they still recommend going early and so forth so you know y- y- you hope that it it it does something to prevent terrorism you know you hope that the people i guess there's a way of getting around an- anything 

327.70 328.50 B: (( them )) 

328.31 331.67 A: but um y- you hope that all the extra effort 

332.08 343.04 A: you know now they're paying federal marshals instead of regular employees to be the the the uh people that stand there at the at the stations to monitor people through and you hope that all the extra expense is gonna 

343.69 352.16 A: make some deterrent but i think like if there's a a determined terrorist he can have like a plastic knife or something that he could actually use if he wanted to you know 

352.12 352.98 B: (( know )) 

352.17 356.08 A: as a as a weapon that would that would bypass metal detectors so 

357.37 358.58 A: yeah 

358.07 368.87 B: ((  )) 

368.85 370.67 A: oh is that true i didn't know that 

370.30 373.63 B: (( the salt lake one for a connecting flight and they had one of those )) 

373.68 375.22 A: right uh-huh 

373.82 374.91 B: (( diners there )) 

375.01 376.26 B: (( and i was )) 

376.31 377.55 B: (( kinda surprised 'cause )) 

377.61 379.53 A: oh i didn't know that so you can't go back 

378.52 383.43 B: (( they gave you plastic silverware 'cause they're not allowed to give out metal silverware any more )) 

383.07 384.77 A: oh i didn't know that 

384.57 385.28 B: (( um in )) 

385.62 386.95 A: oh i didn't 

386.50 388.38 B: (( the airport so so like )) 

388.27 393.78 A: right yeah well and some people you know if y- some people have medical conditions and need to get up and walk around and stuff so 

393.96 395.45 A: (( oh that's inter- )) 

394.78 398.85 B: (( you went there and ordered like somebody in my group ordered like a mini )) 

398.45 399.29 A: uh-huh 

399.14 402.33 B: (( steak and then they got plastic silverware and they were )) 

402.18 406.47 A: i didn't know that is was that just across the board or is that just in certain airlines 

405.97 415.82 B: (( kinda like how am i supposed to cut this like well we don't have any sharp knives in the back either so we can't really help you so mhm oh sure sure )) 

407.49 409.16 A: (( oh oh )) 

410.43 411.24 A: uh-huh 

415.56 423.38 A: oh wow see i haven't flown recently so sin- since they've done that so i'd never heard that before that's interesting i guess they don't want people loitering in the isle way huh 

424.92 428.41 A: yeah o- okay uh 

428.31 431.21 B: (( yeah right right uh-huh )) 

431.48 437.54 B: (( yeah that's true well i think september eleventh really opened up a lot of eyes to )) 

436.96 437.93 A: mhm 

437.65 442.47 B: (( for people in a lot of areas you wouldn't think that that would be something to look at um th- the restaurants )) 

443.92 447.08 A: in on the plane or in the actual uh 

447.18 448.00 B: (( and )) 

448.15 448.96 B: (( stuff )) 

448.20 451.49 A: oh in the airplane so they don't want you oh oh that makes sense 

450.83 463.55 B: (( but i you know after the fact like you said now that you think about it it really probably shouldn't have ever been allowed but wh- you know who knew mm oh i'm trying to think of other security things that the parking in front of the airport )) 

454.78 455.67 A: uh-huh 

461.61 462.71 A: oh 

463.68 468.64 A: that's interesting no wonder they've got lots of fast food stuff in the hallway [laughter] 

465.04 465.91 B: (( the )) 

468.84 469.75 A: huh 

470.23 472.83 A: i never thought about that but that makes sense too 

474.06 482.44 B: (( security gates um i know i i went and met my uh brother he came to visit and i have a a young a young baby in a )) 

483.26 484.72 B: (( in a stroller and i )) 

485.06 486.51 B: (( asked if i could bring )) 

486.57 496.90 B: (( you know go to to meet him at the gate rather than having to wait you know when they come out you know how you can't go to the gate if you're not )) 

496.27 497.37 A: (( yeah )) 

497.86 500.32 A: (( but that's kind )) 

500.33 502.02 A: (( of weird 'cause )) 

502.96 512.39 A: (( i guess before september eleventh all those restaurants could have like big knives and stuff that were never allowed )) 

513.31 514.17 B: (( a passenger )) 

519.35 520.31 A: (( in the )) 

520.92 522.13 A: (( airport )) 

522.52 524.77 A: (( to begin with but )) 

525.27 527.10 A: (( i mean of course any )) 

527.18 539.89 A: (( fast food people could easily pass that off to someone if they knew someone so i just think it's kinda weird that that was something that was allowed for so long that seems like something that n- never should've been allowed mhm yeah )) 

539.70 540.52 B: (( correct )) 

539.92 542.63 A: and and um at the america west 

542.58 555.42 A: counter i was able to go ahead and get a pass to get down there to meet him at the at the gate which i thought was kind of nice but i i did i did have to go through special stuff and they did want a picture i._d. and so forth so it's nice they kind of make allowances they're not being real hard nosed about 

548.22 549.42 B: mhm 

555.27 558.32 A: no you can't it's an absolute rule i m- you know 

557.45 558.27 B: (( mm [mn] oh )) 

559.53 560.37 A: pardon 

560.28 570.09 B: um i go to eastern washington when our basketball team went to a national conference and we had some agreement with the airport that if our team did win 

565.09 566.04 A: (( mhm )) 

569.62 570.69 A: (( mhm )) 

570.78 577.70 B: anyone with a scorer i._d. card could go past the checkpoint and they would have like the band and cheerleaders meet them at the actual terminal too 

577.47 580.33 A: oh to be able to actually greet them and they were going to allow that 

580.17 585.09 B: yeah but we didn't win so that didn't happen but [laughter] that's a different story 

580.77 581.61 A: yeah 

582.73 584.20 A: oh well 

584.51 593.65 A: it's nice though they would make allowances for stuff like that that that is nice but i'm i'm sure they wanted i._d.s and stuff and i'm as a flyer i would comfortable with that you know 

587.28 589.00 B: mhm 

590.15 591.33 B: yeah 

593.18 599.89 B: mhm and then of course it's one of those you had to directly to that south west gate and couldn't just walk
