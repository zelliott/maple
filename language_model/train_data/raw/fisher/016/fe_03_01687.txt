37.18 38.90 A: okay well 

38.69 45.59 B: so i would guess that you uh if if i was going to stereotype the mid west i would say you you you've supported the uh bush initiative

46.16 48.62 A: [laughter] no i do not 

46.47 47.42 B: really 

47.52 49.53 B: i i i would be incorrect 

48.98 57.18 A: yes you would i did not i do not i support the troops but i do not support the president or his reasons for going over there so

74.48 75.51 A: um 

74.59 75.46 B: no 

75.82 88.77 A: [sigh] actually no it doesn't it isn't influenced by my work at all because how shall i explain this i feel like because i work for the federal government i am expected not to have an opinion of my own 

88.76 92.35 A: but to agree with whatever the administration is doing at the time 

92.64 94.17 B: right 

93.56 98.41 A: so i feel like at times my first amendment rights of free speech are limited at work 

98.48 103.41 B: at work so in other words you you couldn't send an email during work expressing a political opinion 

103.08 108.32 A: no [laughter] i have f- if i like to keep my job i wouldn't [laughter] 

104.89 105.76 B: wow 

107.19 109.25 B: (( but can i ask where where do you work )) 

108.87 110.68 A: i work for the census bureau 

110.86 111.93 B: oh wow 

111.43 115.83 A: yeah so i i'm on the phone every night with people from all over the country 

115.87 119.39 A: and there's a lot of pe- there's a lot of angry people out there 

118.99 120.03 B: yeah 

119.50 123.63 A: and a a lot of them just simply won't talk to me because i'm with the government 

124.17 133.33 A: but i mean i'm i'm not angry like a lot of these people are ag- a- against what they're doing in a sense i can agree with it [sigh] i just think a lot there's 

133.33 140.08 A: more hidden agenda on us going over there than what the administration is making us lead led to believe 

139.82 148.95 B: yes i'm like my opinion about the whole thing is that i think that bush and the administration they're they're right for the wrong reasons i think that you know i support what we're doing 

148.26 149.21 A: mhm 

148.81 160.46 B: if for no other reason than we're in the long run saving thousands of lives and and making you know the iraqi people's lives better no matter what the intentions are of the administration i think they're wrong on just about everything i think bush is a moron 

155.54 156.52 A: mhm 

160.01 162.04 A: [laughter] 

160.38 166.29 B: i think uh his economic policy is uh pretty deceitful um you know 

164.53 167.05 A: they are i agree with that [sigh] 

166.43 175.53 B: i think it's pretty you know i i i think basically it's you know administration that's hell bent on crony capitalism and kind of you know feeding the 

175.54 176.39 A: well i'm 

175.61 182.15 B: the mouths of a very few rich people but i i think i think he happens to be right for the wrong reason a- and you know 

177.62 178.67 A: oh yeah 

182.12 191.80 A: [sigh] well i agree uh the iraqi people needed to be freed and needed to have some kind of i'm not going to say democracy because it's still muslim i'm not sure you can ever have a democracy there 

191.40 192.27 B: right 

191.91 195.68 A: but at least the right not to be pulled from your home and tortured the way they were 

195.45 201.18 B: yeah and also i think we're more secure because of because of what's happened you know 

196.12 197.03 A: but 

198.76 200.65 A: i- i think so too 

200.86 206.99 A: and i i really wish he'd pay more attention to other threats like north korea instead of like giving them the cold shoulder 

207.03 208.10 B: absolutely 

207.87 216.19 A: i think that kind of would make me mad if i was the guy in north korea [laughter] but i i mean i'm all for the freeing the people but i think what really upsets me 

208.27 208.93 B: (( a )) 

211.34 212.33 B: yeah 

216.22 227.27 A: about most of this isn't so much the action that we took was the view that some americans have that like an example is the iraqi people some of them are protesting now 

227.60 233.56 A: isn't that what we went over there to give them was freedom and part of that freedom isn't that the freedom to speak out 

233.39 246.80 B: i think it's great they're speaking out and i think you know the more debate that we have in this country i think you know i i personally don't want to go protest against the war but i'm happy every time i see protestors on t._v. because i think it sets an example to the world and to iraq 

245.22 257.60 A: well i think everybody has the right to voice their opinion whether they agree or disagree and it makes it makes me mad when americans go you have the freedom of speech but you don't have the freedom to protest it's like you have to have my freedom or no freedom 

249.07 250.00 B: absolutely 

255.39 256.16 B: right 

257.42 265.94 B: yeah no i don't agree with the protestors but i think it's great that they're doing it i think it sets an example that we have a working democracy where we can handle dissent and disagreement you know 

265.01 277.65 A: i agree and i think that's healthy in a democracy [sigh] but i also tend to wonder [sigh] about now that this we're going to be over there and bringing peace i think more countries need to be involved in the peace measure than just us 

268.09 269.07 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

277.94 280.89 B: um i don't know that i agree with that i think 

279.90 285.05 A: not necessarily the u._n. i'm not saying bring the u._n. in i'm just saying 

282.14 282.95 B: right 

283.65 286.09 B: right but but have partners yeah 

285.32 290.08 A: yeah i i mean supposedly we had all these company uh countries that supported what we did 

290.20 291.16 B: right 

290.56 294.71 A: have them some of them be more visible i guess is what i'm trying to say 

293.08 294.35 B: that's a good point 

294.59 295.60 B: yeah 

295.03 305.54 A: not so much as it's just all us because i think the rest of the world just sees america [sigh] and they don't see our the people that went in with the other countries that went in with us and they d- need to be a little more vocal 

299.71 300.58 B: right 

305.71 309.02 B: so it sounds like it sounds like from what you're saying that 

309.16 315.30 B: you just don't trust the bush administration but you're kind of supportive of what we did just based on your response to what i said but 

314.55 317.19 A: exactly i have a hard ti- 

315.49 323.71 B: yeah so i hear this a lot from from i don't know if you're a democrat or if you consider yourself liberal but i hear this from a lot of people on the left y- 

322.57 327.11 A: actually i'm a registered republican [laughter] [laughter] 

324.72 325.94 B: wow 

325.99 329.18 B: you're hard to categorize as am i that's interesting 

328.43 333.63 A: well i've really [sigh] i did okay i'm a registered republican but i did not vote for bush 

333.74 338.68 A: because i just didn't think he had the qualifications to run the country 

333.85 334.86 B: right 

338.75 339.85 B: yeah 

338.94 348.47 A: [sigh] i didn't think texas was in that great a shape that he could stand up and go hey i can run the country when it seemed to me that texas was last in education in medical insurance and 

347.96 349.56 B: and environment as well 

348.71 355.89 A: in environment and a bunch of other things s- and then with with the way the election went it really made me distrust him even more 

349.70 350.93 B: yeah 

355.97 357.05 B: oh i agree 

356.85 358.38 A: and because i felt 

357.54 364.72 B: b- but but see i think people that are protesting the war i think it's really a protest against the bush administration and i think kind of your comment sort of backed that up 

362.00 363.26 A: exactly 

364.44 365.84 A: i think so too 

364.77 376.14 B: i wonder i mean i would much rather pro- m- my fiancee wants to out and protest against the war and i said i there's a million issues of the bush administration that i would go and protest against but but not this one it's kind of lost leader you know 

372.78 374.05 A: definitely 

374.12 374.99 A: (( no you )) 

375.36 388.60 A: know granted i have not participated in any protests because i do support the men and women that are over there that have joined the armed forces and it's their job to over there and i don't want them to or their families to think i don't support them because i do 

383.07 384.04 B: sure 

384.42 385.45 B: yeah 

388.51 392.81 A: and i agree with you i think it's just [mn] i don't trust him or the administration 

388.57 389.50 B: right 

392.80 393.66 B: right 

393.51 395.25 A: they need freedom but a 

393.87 400.05 B: yeah i mean look at the look at h- how the burton and carlyle group getting all the or not carlyle bechtel just got a huge contract 

399.47 407.53 A: yeah and a l- it seems like a lot of the companies that are going over there [sigh] to like work on the oil rigs and to build buildings and stuff they're all from texas 

407.48 408.60 B: right 

408.00 411.64 A: and it's like wait a minute that doesn't seem quite fair 

412.09 413.23 B: that's true 

413.34 414.80 A: but then i have 

413.76 419.23 B: but on the other hand i mean the the other side of that argument might be well given that we you know 

419.49 428.09 B: put u- the risk out shouldn't we and given that that work has to be done why not have it go to american contractors i mean that m- might be the other side of the argument 

426.85 439.03 A: oh i agree with that but it just seems to me like there's pl- my husband used to work in the oil field back in the eighties down in louisiana so it seems to me there's companies in texas louisiana alabama that are 

439.03 450.10 A: experienced at oil rig rig drilling that could go over and handle the problem that everything doesn't have to be out of texas [laughter] i guess i'm just anti texas now because of bush 

446.15 447.22 B: right 

449.86 451.91 B: huh yeah i know and did you 

450.74 459.78 A: and i really di- i didn't mind his dad but it just really went through me when he got on t._v. and they asked him why we were doing this and he said because he tried to kill my daddy 

460.18 462.70 A: to me it was so unprofessional 

461.33 461.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

463.52 465.90 B: [mn] sorry i i missed the last thing you said i just d 

465.62 473.98 A: oh i was talking about when he got on t._v. and one of the reporters asked him why we were doing this [sigh] and he got on t._v. and he said [mn] beca- he tried to kill my daddy 

474.01 475.44 B: oh i know i know 

474.13 478.09 A: and i thought that was so unprofessional for a president to say 

475.83 476.85 B: (( i know )) 

477.79 482.01 B: we're going to go smoke him out we're going to go you know all those expressions yeah right 

479.81 480.76 A: (( yeah )) 

480.83 492.60 A: and we're supposed to be the country of peace and we're getting on t._v. saying we're got a contract out for this guy's life doesn't seem like a really peaceful approach to me [laughter] [cough] 

491.37 498.19 B: yeah no i think their diplomacy was i mean other than colin powell i think their diplomacy was atrocious and embarrassing i i mean i think they're emba- 

496.73 499.90 A: it is and i like col- i i like colin powell [sigh] 

499.83 507.28 B: but i think the one sort of document of the bush administration that's compelling is this idea of sort of morality clarity which i don't think that they 

507.21 517.13 B: adhered to their own ideology but that's a very powerful idea the idea that you know there's times where you have sort of put the gauntlet down and and and move forward and and 

515.91 517.91 A: that's right i agree 

517.07 525.35 B: and i think that's you know in a in many ways that's really the opposite of what clinton was and i think that that's very appealing coming after eight years of of of you know 

525.43 527.74 B: a president that uh 

527.99 535.05 B: you know we'll just see which way the wind was blowing every day and it was so poll driven and so kind of on both sides on all sides of the issue you know 

534.40 544.38 A: [sigh] well i well uh i agree with that but there's always been presidents that i feel like every president has has done some bad and some good 

544.13 545.34 B: yeah 

544.75 551.60 A: and i have to say that i liked clinton simply because my economy and my way of life got better in those eight years [sigh] 

551.02 553.47 B: we all i mean a lot of us did i think you know 

552.59 565.21 A: i mean i me and my husband got married and we started out the year reagan got elected and i voted for reagan and i thought he was going to kill me [laughter] i couldn't get a job i couldn't go to college i couldn't do half the stuff i wanted to do 

560.64 561.65 B: right 

563.32 564.37 B: (( right [noise] )) 

565.47 568.63 A: and so i didn't mind clinton and it seemed 

568.68 576.93 A: it it it like upset me when they went after him and monica lewinsky because it's like well every other presidents did this but nobody spent fifty million dollars to investigate it 

576.72 584.29 B: yeah there was something about clinton that just that a handful of republicans really found repugnant i mean on a very very deep level i think 

577.40 578.38 A: (( and als )) 

583.40 586.56 A: and i never understood why people a- assumed 

586.84 589.66 A: gore was just like bush or just like clinton 

589.70 591.00 B: right 

590.47 597.28 A: and i couldn't understand why you'd when he had the election we can't vote for gore because he's just like clinton well he's not 

596.66 599.31 B: (( right right that's true i agree )) 

598.18 599.95 A: he wasn't in the room when it happ-
