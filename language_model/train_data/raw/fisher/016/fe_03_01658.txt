45.73 48.10 A: i mean somebody had to do it you know [laughter] 

47.51 55.23 B: right right and i don't believe the u._n. should be involved in it since h- they didn't want to do anything from the start 

55.02 60.38 A: right [noise] yeah i think it's pretty much [noise] in our hands [noise]

98.94 102.94 B: right i just read into the paper where um 

103.64 110.38 B: [mn] anybody that was leaving baghdad the marines were ordered to shoot if they didn't stop at the warning shots 

109.68 111.18 A: yeah 

110.81 114.35 B: and um apparently they shot a lady 

114.90 120.89 B: which [noise] i can see where they're coming from because they're afraid of the suicide bombers 

120.28 121.47 A: right

122.46 123.51 A: yeah 

124.25 126.37 B: innocent people are going to be killed

129.94 131.06 B: uh-huh 

131.20 139.56 A: we're not really doing it you know against them it's kind of for them but i mean i can understand how that would be a hard situation to be in because
