0.75 1.91 A: hello 

1.29 4.34 B: hi this is john calling from boston 

4.18 7.41 A: hi i'm christina and i'm calling from new york 

7.13 10.62 B: hi christina so what do you think of today's topic it 

9.98 14.68 A: [laughter] i've never done this before um so i guess it's it's kind of interesting 

15.28 21.49 B: sure is i i think the middle east is a very broad um very very broad subject 

21.53 29.88 B: and i've been i have um many years in the military so i- i'm probably going to be a little biased on the whole thing right now 

29.44 37.41 A: yeah actually i think you may even compensate for some of my lack of knowledge um at first when when uh the u._s. first entered into 

37.20 39.74 A: conflict over in the middle east uh 

39.54 53.94 A: i was following the news and really staying abreast of a lot of different things but as time has passed i haven't really stayed as up to date on it as i probably should have but um i'm sure you probably have done that especially with your background 

53.73 62.50 B: i i have but i'm i you know i i think it's one of those um you know everything from my my religious upbringing as a catholic as a as a child 

62.44 75.95 B: you i i've thought about it but it's it's i i think peace is um possible there i think it's going to take time i think it's going to take many um 

76.31 78.45 B: many many years with um 

78.59 89.87 B: with us helping out uh i don't think we can stay out of there i think it is truly a world economy now and there's a lot of people over there without jobs and i think that's probably 

89.94 93.58 B: um the biggest problem that we have in the middle east 

93.75 99.27 A: yeah i think i tend to agree with you although i don't know that i really believe that peace is possible over there 

99.85 104.45 A: especially with the alliance the u._s. has with israel 

104.41 106.10 B: mhm 

105.56 109.82 A: how do you think that your military background has affected your opinions 

110.09 112.85 A: i mean what what is your military background i guess 

110.15 110.83 B: wha- 

111.77 112.33 B: (( [cough] )) 

112.40 118.10 B: oh i i've [mn] about twenty two years in the military you know everything from a tank commander 

115.50 116.72 A: oh wow 

118.03 119.53 A: the army i guess 

118.13 118.97 B: uh 

119.00 125.16 B: army right and always enlisted i've been over to the middle east a couple of times 

119.61 120.34 A: (( ahah )) 

124.58 125.64 A: wow 

125.37 127.88 B: and i've never um 

128.06 134.54 B: y- y- you know i think they're people just like us and i think given the right opportunity um 

134.76 139.33 B: i i think peace is possible i i you know i was stationed my first duty assignment 

139.38 153.31 B: was uh on the east german border facing the russians and you know i used to have um people tell me that uh you know they they said you're going to take your grandchildren back and you're still going to be looking at that wall and that's gone 

149.45 150.86 A: [laughter] 

152.96 154.38 A: mhm 

154.05 156.11 B: you know and i was afraid of them 

155.44 160.64 A: yeah and i guess anything is possible after you experience it yourself first hand 

160.76 165.59 A: i don't know [mn] it's just it's hard to believe that 

165.60 176.17 A: there's so much going on over there and i believe that there's probably misinformation on both sides uh i don't know if you saw any of that [mn] minister of information 

176.08 181.48 A: and how you know it almost seemed ridiculous what he was saying on t._v. yeah 

179.18 182.47 B: right yeah bag- baghdad bob 

182.06 185.70 A: [laughter] you know i wonder how much of that 

185.75 199.67 A: you can look at on our side too and say well it's so ridiculous it's not even the truth i mean you wonder what to believe [mn] and and that's kind of what made me turn off the t._v. and just stop listening to a lot you know i'll read an article here and there but i i just 

199.87 201.95 A: uh it leaves a bad taste in my mouth 

201.95 202.88 B: true 

202.94 212.29 B: i had uh easter dinner with my father yesterday and and he's very much uh anti war we shouldn't be there type of thing heh and i you know v- 

210.20 211.36 A: mhm 

211.43 214.18 A: so was it controversy at the dinner table 

213.30 223.56 B: very much so you you know and and he kept saying we haven't found any weapons of mass destruction and i said well spielberg isn't done making them yet [laughter] 

214.50 215.68 A: mhm 

221.07 233.79 A: mhm yes you never know i mean even if we hear that they did find them see i don't i don't know what i believe even if they tell us that they did find them or didn't find them [mn] you know they do have to keep certain information confidential too 

233.18 235.04 B: right mhm [sigh] 

233.81 239.96 A: so i don't really i i take in the information but i find it really hard to to 

240.16 248.40 A: i guess define what my opinion is because i don't know what the truth is and what the truth isn't so although i do think that we should be there 

248.44 252.53 A: i think that there is definitely a need for u._s. presence there at this time 

252.34 260.10 B: right i i think yes but it is very dangerous and i have to um i i i think if there um 

260.34 273.02 B: a lot of the people from the middle east they can't fight conventionally now we've got we've got so overwhelming technological superiority um they're going to find other ways to fight and we look at it as barbarism 

271.66 273.82 A: mhm it's almost they have to 

273.41 280.75 B: right we look at it as barbarism for somebody to uh you know uh convince a kid to strap a bomb to themselves and go into a place 

280.37 291.09 A: but it is almost as though what alternatives do they have they have to resort to almost anything with our technology and the number of our troops also you can't forget about that i mean we outnumber them vastly 

282.88 283.81 B: right 

289.50 290.39 B: right 

291.95 295.37 B: and if i was on the other side you know how would i be fighting you 

294.79 305.16 A: mhm yeah but it but i guess with your background again you probably can consider a lot of points that i can't um you said you've been enlisted for over twenty two years now 

295.42 296.48 B: (( know is the other question )) 

304.76 312.03 B: yeah well national gar- between the national guard and and regular army you know i travelled quite extensively all over the world and things like this 

308.24 309.38 A: mhm 

311.83 324.57 B: but uh you know i wasn't everybody it seems like everyone you talk to now was y- was you know sergeant york and and were fighting and stuff like this i i never liked firing my gun [laughter] 

322.93 324.21 A: (( you know and i )) 

324.73 328.06 B: (( mhm )) 

327.63 329.21 A: (( i probably was if anything )) 

328.12 339.41 B: not not any more not any less i was more on the technical side of things i didn't like the whole running around in the woods and and firing guns and things like that weapons 

338.27 345.93 A: an average soldier ahah i mean i guess you probably have people on both ends but what's your training like when you go through something like that i mean um 

345.92 358.35 A: with this project it sounds like they tried to be very very humanitarian do you think that that's how they are just in general or do you think that that's something they are trying to to portray more heavily on the news 

358.13 361.83 A: as you know the image of the u._s. troops just because [mn] 

362.09 365.63 A: the rest of the world was sort of against u._s. involvement 

365.22 379.07 B: well i i think americans and you know i've looked at it from world war two and and you know i was stationed over in germany and i and i was um worked with a couple of guys who were there in frankfurt when we bombed ninety seven per cent of frankfurt into dust 

379.19 385.33 B: and he- he said you know the we were afraid of the americans one day you're fighting us and the next day you're feeding us 

384.75 385.87 A: yeah 

385.37 389.39 B: so it's it's a very americans have always been that way um 

389.59 397.24 B: you know i i don't think as a people we hold grudges like other people that's why i think we look at the middle east and we see um 

397.30 401.18 B: we see some of these conflicts that go on for centuries 

400.57 413.32 A: yeah but they're religious conflicts basically and i think in the u._s. with our separation of church and state i mean everybody has the freedom to do what they want and religion is supposed to be set aside when it comes to government affairs 

402.09 403.90 B: they're religious conflicts 

413.51 415.20 B: yeah i 

414.38 417.35 A: and over there it's it's not like that 

417.15 422.60 B: but they look at u- they look at this as a religious where they look at it as islam versus christian 

422.34 423.56 A: (( mhm )) 

422.82 433.70 B: to some extent and and and you know i think it's not islam versus christian it's modern versus the the old way versus the new way and the haves versus the have nots 

433.95 440.65 B: we have more it it's it's just we get paid more in a month than most of these people make in a year easily 

438.85 442.65 A: mhm do do they hold it against us 

442.74 443.70 B: yes 

443.84 448.96 A: because we are more fortunate just to be here in an economy that's stronger and 

443.93 444.68 B: they 

449.07 450.43 A: more resilient 

450.09 455.46 B: yes they see our movies and things like this and everything isn't like the movies i try to 

454.70 456.87 A: [laughter] 

455.60 461.81 B: tell people you don't get a parking spot out in front of everything and [mn] and high school kids driving 

461.92 468.05 B: mercedes convertibles and things like that no it's not [noise] that's what they perceive 

463.14 464.77 A: it's not the norm 

465.09 470.73 A: but they that's what they perceive this culture as what's portrayed in movies 

470.44 471.47 B: yes 

471.05 472.11 A: wow 

471.98 480.65 B: and and we're exporting remember our biggest export is is our is our movies and our our culture our television and they're seeing that and they're seeing 

480.66 495.57 B: a very very distorted view of us and everybody thinks that we're we're we're very different it's not just the middle east and when you don't have a job and and you're if you look around there there's not much there and there's not a chance to grow an economy there 

495.64 500.16 B: and their population rates are huge there are a lot of people in the middle east um 

499.56 513.69 A: well do they believe the i mean you know how we see propaganda on t._v. where you know uh uh a u._s. cameraman and person from the t._v. station is over there and as soon as you flick on the camera you know there are millions of u._s. flags burning and 

513.50 519.61 A: tonnes of pictures of our whoever our president is at the time but you know like burned and shredded and everything else 

519.77 526.90 A: is it really like that over there i mean do they really hate the u._s. and think that you know we are like the bane of all evil 

526.52 535.14 B: some do there's there's like anything there's there's a i would say twenty per cent hate us twenty per cent love of us and the and the sixty per cent in the middle 

535.11 547.43 B: is what we're fighting for is is get the hearts and minds of those people but then there's the other thing many of these people want to come to the united states and we put up such restrictions on people coming to the united states 

547.95 548.64 A: (( mm )) 

548.37 554.33 B: now and it's it's impossible so it's it's tough for them to be able to do anything 

554.63 563.51 A: and i guess that that just encourages disgust among the people and you know that makes them not like us again for something different you know if they 

562.14 569.29 B: right and remember it's like talking with someone who is brought up very religiously have you ever met anyone in the united states and they are super religious 

568.91 571.82 A: yeah very fervent 

569.29 572.63 B: and it's hard getting anything through yes 

572.59 586.12 B: i sit on the train and i sit next to a guy every day and and he he has the bible and he sits there and he reads the bible and he's and he's always trying to push it on me oh yeah and y- you know he is asking me every morning have you found jesus yet 

580.86 582.72 A: like a fundamentalist type 

585.16 587.85 A: oh my gosh and you sit next to this guy every day 

586.79 599.89 B: [laughter] well yeah because the train is always crowded and he always sits next to me because and you know i don't mind he can sit there and read his bible all he w- he wants but i don't need to hear pushing it on me you know and telling making assumptions 

587.87 588.95 A: [laughter] 

594.60 595.80 A: mhm 

598.22 599.53 A: (( yeah ))
