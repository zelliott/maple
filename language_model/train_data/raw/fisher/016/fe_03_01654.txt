8.30 9.51 A: how're you doing 

11.24 12.70 A: pretty good 

12.39 13.89 B: boy they couldn't pick a 

15.06 18.10 B: a more controversial subject i don't think 

17.91 19.75 A: nope not really 

19.14 20.37 B: yeah 

20.40 22.22 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] well 

22.91 25.32 B: i don't know [laughter] 

25.74 28.89 A: i honestly doubt there will ever be peace in that region 

28.55 30.22 B: uh well how come 

31.13 34.73 A: [mn] there's too many differences too many old grudges 

34.80 37.56 A: they're never all going to be solved 

38.52 48.54 B: well you know i think you're probably right although you know i'm in kentucky and everybody around here thinks well it's in the bible though you know 

44.44 45.68 A: (( [noise] )) 

48.69 50.12 B: so i i don't 

50.46 57.64 B: think it's because it's in the bible i just i think th- there's yeah there's just too much stuff going on 

53.22 55.11 A: yeah there is a limit to 

57.16 61.13 A: so the second you fix one problem five more come up 

60.63 63.28 B: exactly exactly 

63.04 64.18 A: (( mm )) 

63.94 66.00 B: [mn] and [sigh] 

67.46 71.08 B: you know i'm i'm glad we got saddam out of the way 

71.51 76.32 B: but i have to question our motives for doing that you know 

74.58 76.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

76.48 78.02 B: [lipsmack] um 

79.83 82.61 B: should we continue to be involved i guess 

84.35 89.13 B: [mn] i don't know how come we think we're the world's peacekeeper or something i don't know 

88.13 88.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

89.17 91.40 A: because no one else took the job [mn] 

90.85 92.43 B: well that's true 

92.47 101.21 B: and this thing about yassar arafat i mean if he's going to actually do something how come he hasn't done anything and why do we keep supporting him 

101.49 104.00 B: when he's jerking around you know 

101.71 102.60 A: true 

104.35 106.88 B: i- i've never understood that 

107.15 110.18 A: [lipsmack] me either i mean we just 

110.42 115.53 A: we have peace talks and peace talks and peace talks and well nothing ever gets done 

115.63 121.89 B: he agrees that i mean everybody agrees and then they go back and just just pick right up where they left off 

121.27 122.84 A: it's a vicious cycle [mn] 

122.94 125.99 B: and then innocent people die or get hurt 

126.40 128.74 B: [mn] i don't understand it 

128.14 128.92 A: (( mm )) 

129.41 130.69 A: well 

130.79 135.95 A: if we are to stay involved because we do have a lot of enemies around there 

135.33 136.45 B: yes 

136.64 145.22 A: i mean eventually if you leave 'em alone long enough they'll build up they will eventually come after us 

145.58 149.40 A: [noise] so we might as well take 'em all out now while we're there 

147.13 148.56 B: (( you think so )) 

149.01 155.39 B: y- you think so i mean you don't think they'd just fight each other i mean fight each other so much that they 

155.60 161.89 A: well i mean yeah but then once they figure out there's a common enemy us 

161.66 163.55 B: yeah 

162.08 169.08 A: they'll just eventually figure it out and say hm let's call a truce for five minutes and go bomb america 

171.10 175.33 B: well that's a scary thought thank you very much i'd never thought about it like that [laughter] 

176.66 182.17 B: (( [sigh] let's help let's help um yeah osama bin laden and help him out here yeah )) 

176.76 178.84 A: yeah that's what we did in world war two 

181.84 182.78 A: true 

183.15 188.21 A: then again most of that part of the world has already aligned themselves with bin laden and his 

188.28 189.67 A: evil cronies 

189.41 194.68 B: yeah [mn] i mean i can understand some of it but 

194.69 197.15 B: not all of that not all of it [mn] 

194.83 196.60 A: (( yeah )) 

197.27 198.24 A: (( hold on )) 

202.30 204.16 A: (( okay [noise] )) 

202.94 203.89 B: okay 

205.18 207.94 B: um what else 

207.79 208.73 A: (( hm )) 

212.53 214.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

212.62 216.63 B: will there ever be peace and well we've talked about that 

216.91 220.69 B: [mn] should we be there we've talked about that 

220.98 221.75 A: (( [noise] )) 

221.95 229.71 B: well let's just really get into it do you think the reason that george w. bush got us into this was for oil 

230.36 233.95 A: i think it's part of the reason but not the complete reason 

234.39 235.37 A: i mean 

235.49 241.07 A: a- a- we did have quite an eye opener on nine eleven that people don't like us 

240.61 241.62 B: right 

241.47 242.46 A: so 

242.53 243.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

243.50 245.86 A: just eliminating a threat in my view 

246.02 250.24 B: [mn] yeah well by the way whatever happened to gadafi 

250.97 251.79 B: do you re- 

250.99 252.43 A: (( that's a good question )) 

251.98 256.89 B: you know what was it ten years ago or so i mean he was the most evil thing on the planet 

257.01 258.00 A: (( uh-huh )) 

257.57 262.07 B: and now he's just vanished i'm sure he's around but you never hear about him any more 

261.78 267.14 A: yeah but we did eliminate him effectively as a threat 

267.47 272.48 A: because the simple fact that you don't really him about him any more 

272.58 277.16 A: 'cause he's not running around screaming let's destroy the united states any more 

276.67 278.61 B: [mn] well how did we 

279.02 282.21 B: prevent him from being threat what did we do to him 

282.44 283.96 A: we bombed his house 

283.85 284.65 B: (( oh )) 

285.34 291.31 B: well okay i forgot that [laughter] well yes and no 

287.48 289.23 A: it's a nice thought isn't it 

292.34 293.81 A: i mean we did kill 

293.84 296.43 A: [mn] a a lot of his family members 

296.60 299.91 A: which kind of [mn] quickly shut him up but 

301.28 304.98 A: it is not exactly the nicest thing we've ever done [noise] 

304.55 305.59 B: no 

305.68 307.20 B: [mn] but 

308.42 313.88 B: [mn] and i keep thinking if saddam would have turned out to be a hitler i mean 

313.95 317.50 B: it wouldn't matter whether we went over there because of oil or not 

317.33 320.52 A: well i mean he already has he's gassed his own people 

320.09 324.48 B: yes but they've not found the smoking gun yet you know 

324.14 324.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

324.98 332.31 A: honestly i i i think they're smart enough to destroy most of the evidence i mean there will be enough to build a case 

332.45 338.71 A: but we're not going to find as they said a warehouse full of chemical weapons just lying around 

336.68 337.71 B: yeah 

338.08 339.61 B: yeah 

340.15 344.08 A: [noise] [mn] i mean even ruthless dictators can figure that 

345.47 346.63 B: [laughter] 

347.70 350.22 B: well who do you think is next 

349.67 352.20 A: out who do i think is next hm 

352.60 355.38 A: well i think we'll probably be focused on 

356.54 361.20 A: ah what's it called the [lipsmack] that one guy in california 

362.03 364.20 A: i can't think of his last name um 

364.82 367.16 A: the guy who killed his wife and his 

367.34 369.34 A: we'll be focused on that for a while 

368.52 372.50 B: oh yeah laci peterson yeah yeah 

370.36 380.19 A: yeah all that we'll be focused on that and then eventually we'll wake up again and we'll find ourselves in another country 

374.69 376.46 B: yeah 

379.06 384.26 B: well that's what i'm sa- that's what i meant was what other country are we going to go after next 

384.31 390.82 A: well i mean that- that's really hard to predict because you never know where the next ruthlessly evil person will pop out of 

390.76 391.90 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

391.46 397.57 A: i mean syria's looking awful nice of a target right now but somehow i doubt that's going to happen 

397.41 399.05 B: [noise] [noise] how come 

401.22 408.87 A: because if we do it too soon then they will unite and fight against the infidel 

407.16 411.04 B: [noise] we'll prove yeah we'll prove ourselves to be war mongers 

411.05 412.42 A: exactly 

411.74 416.64 B: [mn] yeah i've heard north korea is kind of scared of us now but i don't know if that's gonna 

415.71 418.67 A: well nor- north korea's another nice target 

418.21 419.37 B: yeah 

418.79 421.45 A: the only problem is they have nukes 

421.67 427.76 B: yeah and he's crazy enough he d- he h- diplomacy is not going to work with him he'd just do it you know 

425.47 427.11 A: he he is crazy 

427.90 429.68 B: yeah 

429.36 437.60 A: [mn] i mean if there's a number one candidate for our super secret mental institution somewhere in idaho h- h- he would be it 

437.63 438.60 B: yeah 

438.91 441.25 B: [mn] do you think saddam is dead 

441.77 445.59 A: ah i i it's i don't think so really 

445.66 449.77 A: i think he's effectively politically dead 

449.09 451.01 B: yeah yeah 

450.03 453.14 A: like he's not in control of anything any more 

452.42 453.45 B: right 

453.90 457.96 A: but i don't think he's dead 

456.68 458.34 B: physically yeah 

459.09 460.14 B: (( hm )) 

462.76 464.28 B: wonder where he's hiding 

464.86 469.06 A: [mn] yep probably in a hospital or a nursery 

469.25 473.10 A: [mn] i i i'm betting one of those two places maybe even a school 

473.01 475.76 B: [mn] have you h- have you heard the latest saddam joke 

475.58 476.42 A: no 

476.95 479.37 B: you know saddam has all these doubles 

479.05 480.00 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

479.79 482.40 B: well they gather 'em all up and they say 

483.66 486.17 B: loyal people was that a parrot back there or 

486.74 487.87 B: a baby 

488.21 489.42 A: hm

510.42 522.05 B: they round up all of saddam's doubles and they say we have good news and bad news the good news is our wonderful fearless leader is alive the bad news is he's lost an arm and an eye 

522.11 523.35 A: (( [laughter] )) 

524.56 532.16 B: [laughter] it's funny that i haven't really heard that was the only joke i heard through the whole little war thing usually you hear a lot of 'em 

532.09 533.74 A: (( yeah [mn] ))
