0.00 1.13 A: hi 

0.93 2.44 B: hi i'm ryan 

2.58 3.47 A: pardon 

3.30 4.49 B: i'm ryan 

4.30 6.78 A: hi i'm deborah glad to meet you 

6.54 7.81 B: nice to meet you too 

8.05 11.29 A: well we're supposed to talk about issues in the middle east 

10.81 12.20 B: okay [lipsmack] 

11.64 18.91 A: okay do you think that this war or any soon coming war [laughter] is going to bring about peace in the middle east 

18.61 24.62 B: i don't think it'll bring peace uh i did support the war when bush first started because 

20.78 21.80 A: mhm 

25.07 30.36 B: saddam hussein in my eyes he's a lot like hitler was back during in world war two 

30.21 31.15 A: right 

30.71 34.42 B: killing his own people and causing just pain and suffering 

34.29 35.43 A: mhm 

34.70 46.33 B: and the united states for the most part supported their involvement in world war two and now they're complaining about the war in iraq but it's the same sort of situation 

47.29 51.91 A: right yeah i i think um i'm pretty much anti war but 

52.26 54.36 A: i can't say that um 

54.69 57.23 A: i think our government did a terrible thing or anything 

57.41 64.12 A: um hussein is an idiot and you know a a a true dictator and needs to be removed from power and 

64.13 67.00 A: i'm not sure they've accomplished it but hopefully [laughter] 

66.65 68.04 B: yes hopefully 

68.19 73.27 A: as far as long term peace i don't think so i don't think we're ever going to see it our lifetimes in the middle east 

72.57 76.64 B: i don't think so either even if saddam is put out of power 

73.93 74.98 A: mhm 

76.70 85.56 B: they're this whole generation of iraqis has been raised in a dictatorship and i don't think they're going to be able to revert to democracy 

85.19 92.39 A: right and a a lot of the arab nations are still just cannot tolerate the existence of israel and um 

92.81 103.97 A: that's you know they just [laughter] i don't know why exactly but i mean i have my ideas but they they just will not tolerate that little country there so as long as they're there there can't be peace among them 

104.13 111.02 B: mhm yeah and and i just don't know how that's going to end up working out and i don't know how long uh the united states should take involvement in that 

110.43 123.56 A: [sigh] yeah i don't know either but i think it doesn't seem like they've quite mopped up you know the war totally but once they do i i can see where we have to be involved somewhat or hussein or somebody else is going to pop right up 

123.16 124.83 B: yeah i agree [sigh] 

124.55 131.13 A: and i know that the uh iraqis don't want to say well they don't they just don't like us [laughter] even if we've helped them 

131.21 134.99 A: you know they think they think of us as the great satan and all and ah 

135.41 138.19 A: i don't know it seems as though um 

138.73 145.40 A: [lipsmack] they're going to fight us the whole way but i think in the long run we have to stay around at least a couple of months what do you think 

144.09 148.82 B: yeah and see wh- see what we can uh try to accomplish if anything 

148.93 150.23 A: yeah 

149.46 152.96 B: get some sort of peace making troops see if they can do anything at all 

153.08 161.76 A: yeah i i think that or you know maybe i mean i- if the u._n. is finally willing to get involved maybe the u._s. should back out let them handle it 

160.99 168.08 B: i uh definitely agree about that the united nations was created exactly for situations like this when there's large 

166.36 167.44 A: right 

168.13 180.42 B: at world problems and the countries were to unite and solve it and united states has gone over the u._n. boundaries in what they've done so far so if the u._n. is finally to cooperate 

169.66 170.63 A: mhm 

177.86 178.76 A: right 

180.46 183.34 B: then we should definitely hand it over to them 

182.82 190.72 A: i think so for for a number of reasons partly 'cause the iraqis might be able to accept that better because there are other arab nations in the u._n. 

190.75 192.92 A: and also because um 

193.03 199.07 A: it won't be just the u._s. you know they have an ugly face for us and um i think until 

199.16 204.63 A: some other countries are involved they're always going to feel like it's this imperialistic move by the u._s. 

204.01 205.63 B: (( mhm right )) 

205.42 208.54 A: i wish we could somehow i i don't know to get this through to them 

208.82 216.49 A: i- i think they think that we want iraq and we don't want iraq [laughter] we just don't want iraq killing people 

213.87 215.81 B: we just want peace over there 

215.99 217.37 B: right 

216.86 223.75 A: i honestly think that they they feel like we want to conquer and have them as like another state i can't think of anything worse 

223.31 226.68 B: [sigh] yeah i wouldn't i would not see the point in that either [laughter] 

226.41 234.67 A: no and i i guess um they they just don't trust us i think they hear so much propaganda that they they just don't trust americans 

234.40 239.79 B: well i guess i wouldn't really blame them i mean it has been a long haul for them against us and t- 

239.43 240.60 A: mhm 

240.07 245.09 B: i don't see how liberating them from saddam hussein is really going to change that at all [noise] 

245.68 253.52 A: yeah yeah i [sigh] they need some sort of democracy and they are not trained for that and i don't know how they'll manage 

253.59 257.13 A: they're used to doing everything by the bully method [laughter] 

255.93 258.35 B: mhm but i think that even 

258.38 261.30 B: just having someone there for a little while they might 

262.13 268.91 B: go along with it let's say but as soon as we pull out they're going to somehow resort back to what they've been trained to do 

264.38 265.25 A: right 

268.70 276.88 A: that's what i'm afraid of but maybe the other arab nations could have some input because they understand their mindset in a way that we cannot 

277.64 281.32 B: yes 'cause we've never been exposed to this [mn] kind of dictatorship uh-huh 

279.88 280.85 A: right 

281.63 286.78 A: and you know and another islamic nation that too they need to hear from um 

287.15 293.90 A: i i i think they just cannot hear us beca- i mean because they don't want to but they really honestly cannot hear us 

295.40 296.59 A: so [lipsmack] 

296.70 300.48 A: well i don't know how soon do you think the war will wrap up 

300.14 310.09 B: oh gosh i d- really don't know [laughter] the more stuff seems to be coming up and is saddam gone or all this kind of stuff i mean looking in probably a couple more months anyway 

302.68 303.71 A: mhm 

306.27 307.22 A: right 

309.89 310.99 A: mhm 

310.34 312.41 B: what do you think about that 

311.96 323.26 A: [sigh] i don't know i i think a couple of weeks could maybe do it but ah maybe i'm just being too optimistic [laughter] um i don't know that they'll tolerate us for months there still fighting 

317.45 318.65 B: [laughter] 

323.42 326.99 A: uh of course they can't stop us but they can make a big outcry 

326.58 328.40 B: right 

327.58 328.76 A: um 

329.30 330.40 A: (( i don't know )) 

330.58 336.57 A: y- you're right though if they can find hussein and his sons and whoever the his top leaders are 

336.75 338.81 A: they'll wrap it up real fast 

338.51 348.44 B: i had heard that uh saddam had murdered his own sons but i don't know if that was just a rumor or 'cause i had heard it secondhand not off the news and i don't know if this is true or not 

345.64 346.63 A: really 

348.57 351.02 A: that's interesting why would he have did they say 

350.82 364.05 B: um [lipsmack] my source [laughter] which is just a manager at work so not too reliable but all the same said uh they were doing something like um drinking american beverage or something just you know a ridiculous reason 

353.47 354.27 A: yeah 

356.56 357.42 A: yeah 

362.17 363.04 A: (( uh-huh )) 

363.65 366.49 A: oh and so it was just retribution 

366.20 367.48 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

366.94 371.37 A: that does sound like an urban legend i'm afraid [laughter] it could have happened though 

371.32 375.57 B: i don't know [laughter] i haven't watched the news in the last few days so 

371.52 372.27 A: (( oh )) 

375.33 382.59 A: yeah i didn't 'cause um i get so tired of it and my husband was away fishing but he's back now so i'm sure i'll get all caught up [laughter] 

381.79 382.86 B: [laughter] 

382.48 390.42 A: [laughter] but i saw enough of it to you know see that they felt we were nearly done but then last night a young woman reporter was there and 

390.56 399.55 A: i don't know if you happened to see that but i mean she kept looking behind her and finally she just said that's too close and she kind of ducked down [laughter] so they're still fighting [laughter] 

396.15 398.45 B: [laughter] no i didn't catch that 

401.40 403.84 A: so i think by and large the 

404.12 406.83 A: real thing is all done the real fighting 

406.72 415.49 B: i hope so 'cause [mn] i i don't think that we went about it the right way in bush making such a large deal out of it and the the whole 

414.17 415.01 A: (( mm )) 

415.37 417.36 A: what do you think would have been better 

415.54 416.81 B: united nations 

417.17 419.46 B: (( i really don't know [laughter] i don't know )) 

418.85 420.27 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

419.49 427.19 B: how it would have been handled better or how it could of or if it would have been different under gore or an- any of these other declarations by the people 

427.36 430.29 A: yeah i i don't know um 

430.84 436.54 A: i tend to think that gore frankly is kind of wimpy so i don't think [laughter] i don't think 

434.15 435.48 B: [laughter] 

436.69 442.47 A: i don't think he would have known what to do and he'd have just followed advisors but um 

443.15 448.78 A: as far as whether i it did seem like bush just this was just he was itching to do this 

448.15 453.16 B: i know it did seem like he was just ready to get out there whenever he could and any reason 

452.83 464.48 A: yeah and i'm and i'm but i'm not sure that he wasn't right [noise] you know i i mean he he knows more information than we do and i think he was just feeling like we have to do something and now is the best time 

463.94 464.81 B: mhm 

464.79 472.94 A: i so i i don't know i don't know if he was right or wrong but i i don't feel like it was an evil choice anything like that 

472.35 474.10 B: oh no i don't think so either 

474.13 476.29 B: like i said uh 

476.39 477.41 B: it's been 

477.75 483.05 B: going on for such a long time he's been murdering his own people et cetera et cetera so 

479.09 480.71 A: [noise] mhm 

482.94 483.94 A: right 

483.26 485.48 B: it's about time someone stepped in 

485.84 488.25 B: and we tried the diplomatic method 

485.87 488.17 A: yeah and who else could really 

488.20 489.04 A: pardon 

488.67 495.45 B: uh we tried the diplomatic methods for years and years and years ever since george's dad was president and it did not work 

493.47 494.46 A: right 

495.36 496.95 A: no they don't respond [lipsmack] 

495.48 504.25 B: and no they don't at all and i think the only way is to have them be bullied by someone even larger than uh [lipsmack] saddam himself mhm 

500.96 501.70 A: yeah 

504.21 507.98 A: yeah and i think that they honestly thought we would not do it 

508.00 519.78 A: and and so we might have had the advantage on that you know they just he would talk about having these huge massive forces well where are they you know and um i think he just figured if he 

515.38 516.29 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

519.68 526.74 A: could convince us that he could actually fight us and if he could convince his own people that they cou- they would win and we would never win 

526.85 536.86 A: that's all he needed to do really and then once the war started he couldn't hide behind that any more his his reputation is shot 

536.33 538.09 B: mm [lipsmack] i think so yes 

537.84 542.10 A: in that country because those who hated him are now not afraid to say so 

541.23 543.17 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

542.61 545.28 A: and those who are kind of on the fence 

545.39 551.45 A: now s- they have to see that he was lying and saying you know oh we could take the u._s. and all that 

551.74 559.97 A: a- and he would also have to see that the people see that the americans coming over there aren't harming them they're not you know [laughter] 

560.28 565.08 A: they're not trying to bring in this loose morals or whatever they thought and 

565.09 566.48 A: none of that's happening 

568.04 569.88 A: so his word is 

570.09 574.01 A: pretty much worthless and i i think they maybe actually know that now 

573.99 582.59 B: well this is good it it is about time he gets out of power and even if a dictatorship maybe just less of a destructive one 

579.64 580.67 A: mhm 

582.70 585.45 A: that's true you can have a benign dictatorship 

583.36 585.21 B: (( but that's a [laughter] )) 

585.47 587.41 A: he's not benign though [laughter] 

587.09 588.08 B: (( mhm )) 

587.88 594.88 A: but i'm i'm afraid they're so used to this that that somebody else with a lot of money and a very persuasive personality 

594.91 596.26 A: could lead them 

596.46 598.55 A: down a very similar path 

598.97 599.89 A: and um
