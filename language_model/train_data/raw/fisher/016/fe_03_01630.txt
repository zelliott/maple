0.15 2.85 B: hi um my name is andrea 

3.10 5.03 A: hi my name's stacey 

5.56 9.70 B: um okay um this is my first conversation so i'm not sure 

9.28 11.00 A: i know me too [laughter] 

11.04 17.12 B: okay so i i guess we we just discuss what our feelings are about the middle east 

16.79 22.05 A: okay i can do that [laughter] so how do you feel about it 

17.30 18.50 B: so 

19.29 20.43 B: um 

22.00 29.30 B: well i i'm not exactly the most knowledgeable person as far as world affairs and foreign diplomacy but 

29.39 30.51 B: um 

31.40 42.48 B: i i definitely had mixed emotions when i first heard that we were declaring war especially with all the adversary and like the u._n. and even our own country was split 

42.59 43.67 B: um 

46.25 48.52 B: it's i think that um 

49.29 51.46 B: i did think that we rushed in 

51.85 59.04 B: a little too much and and the whole war was just a product of like poor planning from the gulf war 

59.93 66.66 A: i i'm kinda i have similar thoughts about it you know i thought that it wasn't really necessary for us to go to war 

66.78 73.96 A: i guess now that we're there i certainly support the troops that are there and you know do anything i can to help their families 

70.77 71.70 B: (( right )) 

74.11 80.70 A: and just but i think it's just a waste of our resources kinda to be over there and i don't 

81.20 92.35 A: i don't think that it's gonna do that much good i doubt that we'll ever have i mean i don't think that they're ever gonna think highly of americans over there because we've just been interfering in their lives for so long 

91.98 95.93 B: i think it's just there's so much like cultural and religious 

96.76 98.13 A: differences 

97.74 102.25 B: yeah differences and like deeply rooted hatred that 

102.90 104.33 B: in their in 

104.37 111.85 B: what they've been taught through politics and through education and and through religion that that like this is just fueling 

112.38 114.39 B: further further 

114.64 125.42 B: terrorism against us and even though we could we're probably going to win the war [laughter] i think we we're going to have to watch our backs for a long time 

125.60 132.96 A: yeah because i think that even though you know now they're getting all this humanitarian aid that's going over there and everything i still think that they hate us 

133.30 134.98 B: yeah i think bush 

135.06 137.31 B: i think bush is trying to 

137.91 143.68 B: well i i know that bush really doesn't have a say militarily i think it's ron stone that you know like 

143.72 150.51 B: pulls all the the strings but um i know i have speak- spoken to a lot of people and they feel that 

151.26 157.23 B: that if we go to war we should go to war completely and we shouldn't give any aid whatsoever 

157.39 158.56 B: and we should 

158.71 161.29 B: i know a lot of people feel that we should just 

161.31 162.95 B: run the country 

162.88 176.71 A: well and it seems crazy too did you know that i just learned this recently i guess i don't pay that much attention to world affairs either and i didn't even realise this but after we're all done we have to pay to rebuild all of their country all the buildings we blew up and everything 

177.12 180.26 A: and so it's going to end up costing us a huge amount of money 

180.35 182.04 A: to do that 

180.51 181.18 B: wow 

181.22 183.26 B: and wow and 

184.16 188.00 B: then what happens when we are we going to have 

188.10 195.61 B: are we going to have like a temporary government that's controlled by the u._s. just to like get them on their way or 

195.73 198.77 B: are we just going to let them try to fend for themselves 

198.79 202.92 A: yeah i think we might be there a long time because i think we're staying there until they 

203.01 206.14 A: supposedly get some sort of stable government 

206.35 207.35 B: i i 

206.40 208.42 A: and that could take a while 

208.78 209.65 A: so 

208.91 211.52 B: yeah i think it's gonna end up being like 

212.11 213.25 B: the 

213.34 219.92 B: the demilitary zone in in korea and we're just gonna have troops stationed there constantly trying to keep the 

220.35 222.23 B: the peace and 

223.42 225.09 B: and i don't i don't know 

225.22 226.75 B: if there's any 

227.83 230.26 B: there's like there's no specific 

231.01 232.19 B: end point 

232.13 233.20 A: right 

232.98 237.27 B: and i i don't even think once this is all over bush has any plans for 

237.36 240.12 B: like what's going to happen with our own country and our 

240.37 242.13 B: our own problems 

243.37 243.93 A: (( [noise] )) 

243.99 247.39 A: well and sometimes i think that maybe it's more 

247.85 254.24 A: that he wanted to go over there to protect the oil that we might be getting from them and things like that instead of 

254.34 256.56 A: really that he just wanted 

256.85 269.61 A: to be rid of saddam or thought that they were gonna have you know weapons of mass destruction against us or something sometimes i think that that was just kind of what they were saying that they were doing over there even though that might not have really been the agenda 

270.17 271.51 A: sometimes i wonder 

271.52 274.14 A: if we're getting the whole truth about the matter 

271.53 272.58 B: right 

274.03 278.81 B: yeah i i really don't think that bush had any intent on 

279.24 280.37 B: at least 

280.89 283.11 B: saving the people that are in iraq 

283.29 284.88 B: i i know that like 

285.11 286.11 B: as a 

286.21 292.10 B: as a result from a theme there there are a lot of people who were oppressed by saddam and 

291.87 302.73 B: who now feel like they're politically free but i don't think that that was bush's intention i think it was it was a lot of of like financial motivation as far as the oil 

303.01 309.49 B: and and just arm- armament security that we don't have to worry about them building nuclear weapons 

309.78 310.94 B: if they 

311.37 319.09 B: if they were designing it to to be used against the u._s. i don't think he had any like humanitarian reasons at all 

317.72 318.72 A: right 

319.73 320.95 B: and 

321.61 324.26 B: i don't even like once 

324.70 327.11 B: if we do find all the 

327.18 337.60 B: the top wanted people that are in that deck of cards that they have issued how do we know that somebody else isn't going to raise to power that that is just like saddam hussein 

337.58 338.60 A: right 

339.05 346.30 A: because they have so many years of hatred against us that i'm sure there will be plenty of other people willing to step up and take his place 

346.32 356.87 B: yeah and the other thing that i was a little worried about is like we went into this war without any sanctions or or any support whatsoever except for for britain 

356.58 357.83 A: (( [noise] right )) 

357.20 364.54 B: and and we did what we wanted to do you think like the other countries like france and russia and germany they're 

364.55 373.97 B: there's gonna somehow keep this in their heads later on and and either unite against us or just have this fear of us 

374.08 378.99 B: for the rest of i don't know however the united nations long they may last 

378.93 380.54 A: well i think that 

380.71 390.56 A: now we tend to kind of think well why are we even a member of the united nations if they're not gonna ever back us up or help us you know they were so against it 

391.78 401.43 A: i don't know then on the other hand you think well maybe we should have waited longer and listened more to what they had to say because they obviously didn't think that there was enough reason to go forward with the war 

401.63 404.68 B: yeah right so we went to war without their approval 

404.15 405.34 A: right 

405.33 416.13 B: did i don't know how as far as it works getting the the support of the general people in america does he have to he has to 

416.79 420.52 B: did he go to war even without support of congress right 

421.75 425.12 A: oh i think that they were behind him i'm not sure though 

425.95 433.54 A: because i didn't really start paying that much attention until we were actually at war because i just thought oh they're just talking about it but we won't really do it that's what i kept thinking 

434.59 435.89 A: then i was kinda 

436.01 437.82 A: surprised when we did 

438.53 439.82 A: start you know 

440.97 443.37 B: yeah i just feel that like 

443.71 445.03 B: a lot of 

446.46 448.57 B: we have we can 

448.77 451.00 B: we can go ahead and 

451.31 456.61 B: and run into any country that we feel is a threat like um afghanistan or 

457.69 460.18 B: or iraq and 

460.76 465.01 B: and pull the strings however we want whether it's like covertly or whether we 

465.26 470.54 B: declare an all right all out war and i think that 

471.77 483.35 B: we're just we're just gaining so many enemies from doing this not acting diplomatically and just thinking that because we are a world power we can we can do whatever we want 

482.98 485.45 A: right yeah i agree with that [noise] 

485.80 492.27 A: well now they've been talking about syria that maybe we would end up going into syria because they think that they might be 

490.54 491.37 B: really 

492.40 504.52 A: harboring some of those people that we're after you know that escaped from iraq that they might be hiding out in syria and if they they're protecting them then we then you know then what will we do and and it could get to be another mess 

502.31 503.45 B: (( wow )) 

504.41 506.11 B: where's it gonna end 

506.13 511.67 B: do you know if israel is supporting us in any of this i i don't think i've heard anything from them 

511.23 513.25 A: i don't know what their position is 

514.59 520.98 B: it seems strange like this is i think this is directly related to them because they'd have less of a threat if we're there 

522.07 525.71 A: yeah you'd think some of those surrounding countries would be glad that we're there 

526.11 535.26 A: but i don't know they might have some more feelings about us [laughter] the people in iraq do that they just think we should mind our own business you know and stay out of their countries 

536.13 537.29 B: yeah i 

537.38 538.67 B: and i'm also 

539.54 543.57 B: i'm also wondering if we say we were to 

544.04 553.64 B: to invade iraq and and not care about what any other country had to say about it and we take over their land and we you run it as a colony or something 

553.50 560.56 B: who's gonna who's gonna stop us and and i mean where's the system of checks and balances 

560.60 564.78 A: right there's not very many countries that could stop us probably 

560.83 562.29 B: globally 

565.42 567.05 B: yeah well i 

567.27 570.38 B: i think the only reason why we haven't done that is just 

570.75 575.19 B: the only people that that would be a threat to 

576.16 582.14 B: like the united states doing this is the united states i'm sure like a lot of voters would be against that 

581.23 583.20 A: yeah 

582.90 586.65 B: but i don't see any any way of stopping if we 

586.77 594.39 B: if we decided to invade any country like china or north korea i'm sure north korea wouldn't put up much of a fight 

595.86 597.63 B: it's it's kind of scary 

597.86 599.24 A: yeah
