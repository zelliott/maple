122.56 123.69 B: right [cough] 

128.51 134.34 B: right i think there is a better chance for it with um that regime gone over there 

133.57 135.13 A: mhm 

134.36 141.79 B: um if they try to bring democracy i i think there's a better chance for peace now than there was maybe ten years ago 

141.48 144.36 A: mhm right right 

142.64 145.30 B: um but i don't see it happening 

145.42 146.80 B: in the near future 

147.28 152.29 B: i mean because of the fact that you already have so many of the other countries over there iran 

152.05 153.28 A: uh-huh 

152.56 157.22 B: and some of the other ones that are already saying no we're not gonna recognize an american 

156.75 157.72 A: uh-huh 

157.68 160.09 B: leadership in iraq 

160.12 161.21 A: uh-huh 

160.87 161.83 B: um 

162.44 163.93 B: so [laughter] 

163.70 169.25 A: yeah but i i do think now it i don't mean it's gonna happen next week 

168.65 169.88 B: right 

169.31 171.43 A: but it's gonna happen 

170.70 172.17 B: i believe it will 

172.21 173.97 B: eventually 

173.08 175.37 A: yeah eventually it will happen 

174.66 183.80 B: i mean surely to goodness you can't have [laughter] right i i don't think it can be like the hatfields and mccoys for ever [laughter] so 

176.41 177.84 A: i hope that uh 

181.59 190.57 A: right right and and that's exactly what it is and that's y- you y- you y- you put it right on the spot that's exactly what it is 

184.66 185.62 B: (( uh-huh )) 

190.40 191.72 B: just um 

192.30 198.81 B: i don't know personally i think it's i think everybody would be a lot better off if there wasn't a feuding over property anyway 

198.36 200.32 A: mhm 

198.96 205.80 B: and that's basically what it boils down to is the state saying no everything here belongs to us and the people can't have anything 

205.64 208.80 A: right right 

205.82 207.22 B: but what we allow 

207.65 208.99 B: you know and that's just 

209.54 212.50 B: i don't know i believe every person should have their own 

212.65 214.42 B: opportunities 

213.65 225.30 A: right right i do believe that i don't think that it's it's it's more so mind controlling uh s- one one man who i call a demon uh is uh 

223.04 223.94 B: uh-huh 

225.32 227.08 A: taking over minds 

226.79 229.67 B: mhm 

227.76 235.00 A: you know and and and that's what he's doing and uh the people are afraid to to do what they supposed to do 

229.72 230.45 B: [noise] 

235.59 240.74 A: the right way because he he tells them the right way and the wrong way they have no minds of their own 

236.70 237.75 B: right 

240.20 244.32 B: exactly i think it'll probably take several generations 

243.80 245.72 A: [mn] oh yeah oh yeah 

244.55 246.98 B: for that country to overcome that 

246.74 247.90 A: uh-huh 

247.64 252.74 B: um because you've got people over there that for their whole lives have lived this way 

251.66 254.31 A: mhm 

253.13 256.32 B: and i can't imagine how it's gonna be for them 

256.30 258.25 A: mhm 

256.99 259.44 B: to try to change their whole way of thinking 

259.08 262.45 A: right right but 

260.68 261.57 B: um 

262.77 266.73 A: but w- once once i believe once they allow 

267.71 273.21 A: the man upstairs to come into their country it'll be straightened because 

272.20 274.03 B: mhm do you think that'll happen 

273.95 279.47 A: i i hope and pray it does i can't say but i do believe it will 

276.46 277.91 B: [laughter] 

278.24 285.40 B: right i mean we're just talking opinions you know and and thoughts and i just really wonder as as religious 

280.39 282.40 A: mhm 

285.52 287.37 B: as the the people 

287.71 297.17 B: seem to be over there with you know stopping and going to the temple several times a day and things like that i i just wonder if they will ever 

289.12 291.14 A: mhm 

298.10 303.06 B: what it would take for them to accept god rather than you know [noise] well the- i they that's

317.48 318.44 B: right 

318.84 324.00 A: you know i think they just serve this man or statue or whatever [noise] 

324.12 326.05 A: but god is not a statue 

325.68 326.67 B: right 

327.38 328.27 B: um 

329.08 333.71 B: uh as a matter of fact my husband and i had this debate the other day um 

333.94 337.88 B: about because i was trying to explain to him what i had read about how um 

338.04 341.79 B: they they believe that everybody over here in america is evil 

341.38 344.08 A: [noise] [noise] uh yeah oh yeah uh-huh

355.99 357.49 B: mhm 

356.62 359.65 A: christ as their personal savior but 

359.83 365.95 A: why are we so evil what have we done that was that's so evil to them bec- because we don't believe what they believe in 

365.57 367.43 B: (( that's all i can imagine )) 

368.51 374.02 B: that's all i can imagine that it could well and and what was it osama bin laden 

369.54 370.62 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

373.70 375.66 A: mhm 

374.20 376.11 B: he basically said that 

375.76 376.76 A: mm 

376.50 382.20 B: that um we were the infidels because um we didn't worship their god 

382.27 389.93 A: right [noise] [mn] i i mean the word the the the word that i live by is one god one face 

386.05 386.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

390.20 393.55 A: one belief and that's he [noise] himself 

391.12 392.27 B: mhm 

393.41 394.54 B: right 

393.74 401.13 A: that's what i believe if if if if the bible tells me that and i read it [noise] it's gotta be true 

400.56 401.73 B: right 

402.19 408.14 B: well and i don't think i've ever read in the bible where it says go out and slaughter an entire country 

407.86 411.68 A: [noise] no it d- d- does not it does not it definitely doesn't say that 

409.35 410.52 B: [laughter] 

411.15 413.26 B: [laughter] exactly 

412.85 415.48 A: it does not say that 

414.48 420.55 B: so um i think on back onto the topic though i think possibly peace can be achieved 

420.62 425.07 B: eventually but i don't think it'll happen probably not even in my lifetime 

424.63 432.19 A: [noise] no no it won't happen in my lifetime i'm almost fifty years old and i don't think that it will happen during my lifetime 

429.85 431.01 B: well i'm 

431.59 435.83 B: i'm almost thirty [laughter] and i don't think it's gonna happen in mine either 

432.93 438.09 A: [laughter] oh oh you the same age as my daughter [laughter] 

436.58 439.34 B: [laughter] so 

438.38 443.37 A: yeah okay but i really don't but i hope and pray to god that it will 

439.55 440.52 B: um 

442.46 447.42 B: right and i agree with you on that and i pray for the pray for our soldiers every night 

447.10 448.61 A: oh definitely 

447.90 452.37 B: and the families that have have lost so much from this 

451.28 458.50 A: [mn] mhm and then and what really touched me was a nineteen year old kid who was not able to live a life 

459.05 461.67 A: a lifetime of what i've lived 

461.23 462.37 B: mhm 

461.84 464.67 A: and that showed me how blessed i am [noise] 

464.72 475.02 A: that i was able to live and he's ni- he was nineteen years old then then the uh the uh uh p._o._w.s uh all of that bothered me 

467.95 469.00 B: goodness 

473.14 474.27 B: (( mhm )) 

474.97 481.59 A: but i i praise god that they got back home all of 'em got back home and and and the war today is 

477.30 478.52 B: yeah 

481.72 485.25 A: (( not bec- it it's unnecessary )) 

484.54 485.59 B: right 

485.41 487.10 A: it's totally unnecessary 

486.86 492.79 B: i don't think that it should've ever been started i don't think that it was any of our business really [sigh] 

491.26 492.26 A: i 

492.84 504.48 B: i think that as a country um if the people were that unhappy with how things were being done they should've had an uprising against him there was more civilians than there were army [laughter] 

500.92 502.94 A: mhm 

503.62 507.24 A: uh-huh exactly exactly 

504.90 515.26 B: [laughter] so i mean you know over here if we don't like our president guess what he goes out of office if enough people don't like him we don't keep him 

511.08 512.81 A: uh-huh [laughter] right 

514.75 516.81 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

515.62 518.24 B: you know and it just seems to me like 

518.37 523.61 B: there are a lot of people a lot of the civilians over there who weren't complaining 

523.32 525.27 A: mhm 

524.22 533.11 B: i mean i'm sure a lot of 'em were and i'm sure a lot of 'em really were being treated bad but it doesn't se- it seems like there were a lot of people who who were happy with him 

527.89 529.33 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

532.95 534.81 A: mhm 

533.47 538.70 B: i mean in watching the news and watching all the people that were going up and hugging him and cheering him and stuff 

537.77 540.10 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

538.80 543.42 B: with our soldiers right there to protect 'em if they didn't and and they still did 

543.05 545.42 A: mhm mhm 

544.67 545.67 B: so 

546.13 552.70 B: i don't know and then i saw um an aerial photograph of where they pulled down the statue of saddam 

552.02 554.28 A: (( mm [noise] mhm )) 

553.03 560.37 B: and it's been in the news so much lately and yet from the aerial photo you could see that it wasn't such a great big crowd like 

560.61 562.78 B: what we've been led to believe 

562.17 564.07 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

562.96 566.93 B: um from an aerial view it only looked like maybe a hundred people out there 

566.55 567.62 A: uh-huh 

567.02 569.14 B: in a city of thousands 

568.03 571.27 A: right right right 

570.40 577.53 B: so i mean i just it there's a part of me that has to wonder you know exactly what was this war supposed to have been about 

577.01 578.06 A: right 

577.83 592.24 A: and and and what uh what bothers me and puzzles me a lot uh is that when they blow up these different places uh buildings and [noise] hospitals uh killing kids we killing babies who have not 

592.17 594.45 A: even known life period 

593.45 595.88 B: yeah that's exactly right 

595.03 599.03 A: i mean how in the world can they think they can answer to that 

598.09 599.95 B: [sigh] i don't know and i'm glad i
