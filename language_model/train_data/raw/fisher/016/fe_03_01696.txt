9.60 11.28 A: oh right [laughter] 

10.60 13.22 B: yeah did you hear the topic 

12.94 14.34 A: yes i did 

13.77 18.54 B: the topic i believe i heard was says um regarding peace in the middle east 

17.95 19.26 A: mhm 

19.21 22.52 B: but it sounded more like they were trying to be specific to iraq 

23.01 24.65 A: probably 

24.78 26.78 A: since that's what's going on 

26.47 30.74 B: yeah and they had mentioned do they feel that the u._s. should be involved still 

30.97 35.54 B: as far as i can tell it only seems like that would be with iraq at this point 

34.98 43.13 A: mhm yes i um i don't watch news and i don't read the paper and i have no idea of what's going on 

43.10 44.63 B: for really 

44.34 45.20 A: really 

44.88 47.63 B: i'm surprised 

46.86 47.86 A: (( i ah )) 

47.93 55.89 A: i went to my girlfriend's one day and you know she was going oh the war the war and i just looked at her and i was like what are you even talking about 

56.30 58.79 B: that's i'm surprised [laughter] 

56.52 57.40 A: (( i'm just )) 

58.67 59.73 A: i ah 

60.13 62.96 A: i just don't i don't watch t._v. i you know 

63.34 66.90 A: i don't ah i guess i'm in my own little world 

66.41 69.14 B: well there's nothing wrong with that by any means 

69.49 74.30 A: [laughter] um i think if it's i mean from the 

74.68 76.83 A: what happened in new york 

77.46 78.83 B: with september eleven 

78.44 88.61 A: yeah if the war is because of of that or that is involved i think we need to 

88.74 93.15 A: be involved and do whatever it takes so that it doesn't hopefully happen again 

93.11 95.22 B: i would agree with that 

95.31 96.53 A: but um 

96.75 98.60 A: i just i don't know what's going on 

98.36 99.69 B: [laughter] 

98.95 100.02 A: [laughter] 

99.74 109.14 B: well the the latest happenings is that after about four weeks of being at war in iraq um the 

109.52 114.59 B: governing party there has been toppled so after four weeks we've already 

114.68 117.44 B: s- so to speak liberated iraq 

117.51 121.94 B: and we're now trying to install a new government for them 

121.58 122.53 A: (( oh really )) 

122.10 123.50 B: yeah 

122.86 123.83 A: okay 

124.89 126.43 A: okay well that's 

126.70 129.92 A: that's probably going [laughter] in the right direction 

129.33 131.35 B: yeah that at least we hope so 

130.95 131.92 A: yeah 

132.34 134.43 A: are who are they putting in 

134.28 143.55 B: um they've taken one of our former lieutenant generals i guess from the united states and he's there to work as the 

143.64 147.58 B: main person to mediate instituting the new government 

148.53 149.25 A: (( mm )) 

150.04 150.82 A: so 

150.94 152.95 A: this guy is going to 

153.17 155.51 A: find people over there to 

156.24 159.47 A: be the new government or run the new government 

157.64 158.76 B: yeah that's well 

158.71 161.17 B: yeah that's the idea 

160.61 161.23 A: (( mm )) 

161.13 173.77 B: and then i guess the the next main topic is whether or not we stay involved in it after that new government is put in place or not you know ideally thinking will they be able to keep peace for themselves or not do 

174.38 175.29 A: yeah 

174.39 179.88 B: we set up bases like we had in germany or you know as we still do i should say in germany 

179.70 190.14 B: after like world war two do we have that kind of involvement still where we keep bases there and keep our presence in the country or not i think that's the next biggest question the press is raising at this point 

190.13 191.40 A: oh huh 

191.32 196.63 B: and i guess that would fall right in line with what we're thinking about and our topic tonight is whether or not peace 

197.38 199.65 B: will come about or not 

198.25 199.29 A: mhm 

200.56 203.37 A: well i wouldn't i would think that 

204.48 205.98 A: we should stay 

206.95 208.98 A: for a while at least 

209.42 212.80 A: just to make sure the other guys don't get back in 

213.32 227.00 B: yeah well not knowing where they are at this point is also a big concern as well 'cause they they've only found a couple of people on the list list of fifty or so people the want to capture or find the whereabouts of and that that leaves an 

216.90 217.80 A: right 

226.96 232.91 B: outstanding presence of knowing okay is peace going to prevail or not if we leave and don't have these people in custody 

233.28 236.80 A: yeah so they're saying that there's fifty people that 

237.19 239.00 A: are running iraq 

239.33 242.12 B: no they there are [mn] 

242.50 248.79 B: at least fifty people that were running the old iraq that they were looking for 

245.51 247.35 A: oh okay were [laughter] okay 

248.84 249.70 A: huh 

250.09 251.74 B: that they've been looking for 

251.88 256.19 A: that's kind of amazing that only fifty that's not very many people 

255.82 257.71 B: well well if you 

257.73 266.68 B: there's been a lot of things that are coming out now that make you sort of wonder how they controlled what they did and it was they worked like sort of a 

266.65 277.99 B: and old italian mob is what they worked like because some of the things that we're finding out i mean the country was in ruins while they lived in the lap of luxury just like sorta gangsters did back in the old new york days 

277.73 279.05 A: oh really 

278.52 284.94 B: yeah it's pretty funny to read some of the articles they found and the things that they did or tried to do at least 

284.67 285.68 A: huh 

286.02 287.15 A: wow 

287.49 291.03 A: i guess [laughter] i should be paying attention to the news hm 

291.06 291.84 A: (( hm )) 

292.09 293.50 A: oh that's interesting 

293.35 299.71 B: yeah do you live near a metropolitan area or are you in a rural area up in washington 

299.39 302.89 A: no i i'm ah about an hour north of seattle 

302.49 303.39 B: okay 

303.40 309.17 A: i used to work for boeing but because of september eleventh i got laid off because nobody's buying airplanes anymore 

308.88 312.18 B: yeah definitely not at the rate they were if at all 

311.08 311.84 A: yeah 

311.94 320.40 A: yeah yeah no we we were ah putting airplanes down in arizona in the desert to mothball them because that's the air down there doesn't rot them 

320.41 322.79 B: oh that's interesting to know i didn't know that 

322.21 327.62 A: yeah yeah we well we were building them and then all of a sudden people says oh we're not buying them 

327.38 328.48 B: yeah 

327.82 332.23 A: and they backed out of their deal and the planes are built so they 

330.53 332.06 B: yeah huh 

332.42 336.42 A: put put this white paint on them and stick them down in the desert 

337.30 339.00 B: interesting 

338.33 340.55 A: you know it like preserves them 

340.27 341.43 B: yeah 

340.80 342.32 A: the dry air 

341.95 343.18 B: and the heat 

342.81 343.74 A: uh-huh 

343.27 344.75 B: the constant heat 

344.32 345.22 A: uh-huh 

345.01 346.37 B: that's funny 

345.78 349.38 A: yeah so i'm without a job [laughter] 

349.10 350.06 B: wow 

350.53 354.09 A: therefore i have no contact with anything anymore 

353.69 354.80 B: [laughter] 

354.20 358.29 A: [laughter] i sit home and play with my animals and let the world go by 

359.84 365.11 A: in fact i talked to a lady last week with this um and she's in iowa 

359.86 360.98 B: that's pretty 

365.23 374.35 A: and it was something about you know has anything changed since the september eleventh and she's in iowa 

374.65 385.09 A: nothing is different she's on the farm she has no idea that the what the world is going through she doesn't know anything about going security checks and you know and it was like 

385.18 386.45 A: wow 

386.49 388.07 A: that's really amazing 

388.27 391.43 A: and yet i'm [laughter] pretty naive right now too 

391.38 398.72 B: that's interesting well i guess we're i guess it all depends on where you are and what you what the the life situations you are involved in 

398.79 403.24 B: could ah give you an idea as to what you may surround yourself with 

402.99 403.94 A: right 

403.51 409.87 B: i know here in southern california that's all we deal with is what's going on in the world so to speak 

410.01 410.98 A: wow 

410.32 418.36 B: so we ah we're pretty involved with are pretty surrounded by trying to figure out what's going on 

418.71 421.10 B: and always keeping a tab on what's going on 

422.31 427.54 A: mhm are you in it as as a living or just that that's what's going on 

427.50 430.40 B: um basically that's just what's going on 

430.18 431.05 A: yeah 

430.72 431.62 B: yeah 

431.63 433.78 B: i know quite a few people who are 

434.15 437.54 B: over and involved in the conflict in iraq 

437.63 444.41 B: so it makes it sorta more personal to a sense of knowing somebody who's over there and they may not come back and i may never see them again 

439.64 440.67 A: mhm 

444.61 446.18 A: (( right right )) 

445.17 457.93 B: and all for the process of hopefully providing a stable country to the people who live there and hopefully finding what they originally went in for which was weapons of mass destruction and proving that they had them and and disposing of them 

456.66 457.69 A: mhm 

457.99 461.26 A: yeah i i believe that the weapons are there 

461.71 466.00 A: i've heard people talking about that and i i think that they're there somewhere 

466.43 475.72 B: well i i hope for the fact of of giving you know substantial reason for us to go in and and not follow along in what was believed in the u._n. 

475.82 486.01 B: saying we're just gonna not agree with you and go in anyways because we know they're there and we want to stop them from using them and i hope that they find them for just that purpose alone 

485.72 486.63 A: mhm 

486.39 489.72 B: as well as you know for the whole pre- peace process and knowing 

490.16 499.97 B: letting other countries in the surrounding area know the the situation as it is you shouldn't you shouldn't be harboring people who are involved with these things 

496.79 498.02 A: exactly 

499.57 501.50 A: right right well that's 

501.54 502.68 A: so true 

503.18 508.43 A: hm yeah i don't ah i don't know anybody that's over there in fact 

509.14 513.56 A: any- you know the people that i used to work with i don't think there's 

513.78 514.87 A: anybody 

515.38 519.08 A: in my in my surrounding area that we know 

519.80 521.33 A: anybody that's over 

520.89 523.31 B: really that's interesting too 

521.42 522.42 A: yeah 

523.06 524.40 A: yeah 

524.56 528.23 A: i mean i'm sure there are it's just people that we don't know 

527.28 528.93 B: yes nobody that you know 

528.66 529.58 A: uh-huh 

529.91 530.69 A: (( hm )) 

531.27 538.31 A: i feel like i when she was saying the what the subject was it was like i almost hung up 

538.67 541.93 A: because i'm so out of the loop 

541.52 542.99 B: yeah 

542.51 544.30 A: (( you know i just don't ah i )) 

544.88 548.94 A: mean i i know a long time ago when they were talking about the 

548.97 552.25 A: the weapons that were over there and i mean it's just 

552.81 557.17 A: where i i live in a small town i think we have one stop light now 

556.84 557.98 B: yeah 

557.40 561.01 A: and it's farm it's a farm community 

561.47 570.31 A: and um i mean the newspaper our our local newspaper has nothing on anything outside of our town 

569.81 572.05 B: really wow

573.23 575.02 A: no um 

575.12 583.05 A: government no federal government there's nothing it's just local you know it's maybe six or seven pages [laughter] 

583.91 586.92 A: and ah so i just i don't 

587.19 588.73 A: (( i'm out of the loop )) 

588.83 599.89 B: well like i said like i said there's nothing wrong with that by any means i mean you have a life that you live and that's probably one of the more protected areas in life of what we know as america to be so i 

588.96 591.30 A: and i don't get the big paper [laughter]
