36.37 39.46 B: you know just financial support and

59.84 69.58 B: in history we've always gotten ourselves into these [sigh] situations where we're supporting and trying to help educate and bring up third world countries 

69.44 70.93 A: right 

69.45 78.44 B: and we have people in our own country you know like in appalachia that don't have enough food on the table and [sigh] have dis- diseases and 

78.66 84.54 B: and epidemics that for the rest of our country don't even exist anymore

95.70 96.38 B: (( [mn] )) 

97.28 99.44 B: yeah and you know 

98.38 99.65 A: that's true 

99.54 110.47 B: when i was a kid i used to hear [mn] i i some of it i i i think back and i remember hearing my parents' different comments and pe- adults around me when i was a kid and it's like it hasn't changed 

110.31 111.99 A: yeah that's true 

110.79 115.63 B: (( i- i- i- it hasn't changed so what are we doing wrong here [laughter] you know )) 

115.32 119.00 A: yeah that yeah that is true yeah i agree with you there 

119.13 122.66 B: but um [lipsmack] i also cannot imagine 

122.99 127.51 B: [mn] living in a country that's been at war like they have been at war 

127.46 131.51 A: yeah they're used yeah they're used to fighting over there long wars and stuff 

127.61 128.41 B: yeah 

130.38 133.02 B: [mn] yeah i just um 

134.39 136.24 B: [mn] i haven't ah 

137.89 143.10 B: um i haven't ah you know had that kind of experience i mean it's one thing 

143.77 154.45 B: i guess not to have food and to have disease and all that but another thing to have lived through bombings and shellings and machine gun and air raids and 

153.69 155.59 A: (( yeah that's yeah mm )) 

155.06 157.84 B: th- the psychological [mn] 

157.46 158.85 A: (( yeah )) 

157.90 162.60 B: i i guess and i think about kids you know i mean how 

162.92 170.09 B: [mn] how's that going to affect them and what's going to happen to them as they grow up to become adults are they going to hate our country 

167.26 168.05 A: yeah 

169.83 173.43 A: yeah that's true yeah that's that's what i was wondering about too 

173.21 177.79 B: because of it you know i mean i- 'cause it's like [mn] i can see [mn] 

177.77 188.53 B: ah well we've changed their lives permanently w- no matter what but it could be for the worse and i know you know they've already started dropping food packages and 

188.50 196.68 B: and all that kind of stuff and the red cross is in there but are they going to address the psychological issues and that sort of thing 

197.09 198.66 B: i i don't know 

197.18 198.22 A: yeah that's 

198.58 204.24 A: yeah i don't know neither i tell ya it's it's really it's really been rough over this stuff 

204.87 206.80 A: the war and stuff has 

206.52 217.43 B: [mn] well i've knock on wood [laughter] you know i've had family members that have been like in world war two and the korean war an- and all that kind of stuff but i personally have never been 

217.51 230.60 B: on a- you like either end of it i've not been in the military and i've not been like a said live in the country where that has been war and i don't think i'm [mn] we see a lot of it on t._v. and stuff and i don't think we grasp 

230.46 231.97 A: (( [laughter] yeah that's true )) 

230.96 233.09 B: the reality of it 

232.57 236.45 A: oh yeah that's true yeah that's very true yeah 

234.37 236.68 B: (( you know it used to you )) 

237.01 245.99 B: know [mn] people would come back and tell stories of their experiences what they saw and all that and i think that impacted you more 

242.45 243.42 A: uh-huh 

245.76 246.75 A: uh-huh 

246.30 248.31 B: than seeing it on t._v. 

248.16 249.18 A: yeah 

248.58 251.25 B: i see it on t._v. and it's almost like it's 

251.68 257.22 B: not r- there's something that detaches you it's like it's not real or whatever that kind of thing 

257.38 259.24 B: and um [sigh] 

259.40 264.47 B: i i don't know i don't think we belong over there but i think now that we're there we're committed 

264.46 267.84 A: yeah that's true yeah i agree with you yeah 

264.85 265.80 B: (( you know )) 

267.01 272.37 B: and it's it's kind of like um yes i was against the war i didn't think we should do 

271.36 276.91 A: well they they say he had ah mass ah weapons of mass destruction over there so 

277.28 291.28 B: it [mn] i think they knew that you know i think they've known that all along [laughter] what was really a friend and i were talking about this was really bizarre a f- a few weeks ago there was a movie on t._v. it was one of these series movies like 

277.96 279.06 A: (( ah )) 

279.17 280.02 A: yeah 

291.35 292.04 A: uh-huh 

291.42 299.25 B: and th- the storyline was that the united states had sold chemical warfare 

299.26 300.52 B: [mn] to 

301.02 313.94 B: iraq way back when we weren't at war with them [mn] and they in turn had sold it to iran or some other place and then thi- this platoon like was in in desert storm 

313.74 314.67 A: uh-huh 

314.90 325.81 B: went to check out a bunker and one of the canisters leaked and these guys there were s- three guys that died from this rare form of cancer that was like really rare and so why would three people 

325.72 326.36 A: (( mhm )) 

325.85 327.85 B: in the same company you know 

327.69 342.28 B: die from it if it's so rare [mn] and when they you know this lawyer was trying to figure out what was going on that was the bottom line what they found out was that the united states was manufacturing chemical warfare after we signed a treaty that said we wouldn't do it anymore 

327.69 328.59 A: yeah 

342.05 345.97 B: then we sold it someone that turned out to be our enemy later on down the road 

345.82 347.16 A: right yeah 

346.51 358.81 B: and then we wanted to go back in there and get it back [mn] [laughter] and i and then [laughter] and i i thought about that and then you know a week or two later then they announce how they found all this these chemical warheads and all this stuff and i'm like 

349.27 351.50 A: (( right yeah [laughter] )) 

359.05 367.74 B: was that just coincidence [laughter] you know or or was that the government's way of maybe preparing us [laughter] or something i don't know you know 

361.22 362.49 A: [laughter] 

365.86 366.97 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

367.00 369.80 A: yeah that's what i always wonder too yeah 

368.86 378.82 B: you know 'cause i was thinking how can they you know i know there's you know freedom of speech and t._v. and all that but man they can't put stuff out there that if the government didn't want 'em 

378.86 383.88 B: to air it it would not be aired you know kind of thing [laughter] and so 

381.41 382.90 A: right yeah 

383.76 398.03 B: i called a couple of friends i said did you remember [laughter] watching this and now do you hear what they're saying on the news it's almost like it desensitizes to you so y- you're not alarmed you're not like i knew it i just knew it but you're not outraged by it 

397.37 399.61 A: right yeah that's true yeah 

399.04 409.53 B: yeah that kind of thing and i'm like well [mn] i don't know i i don't think i don't think you know like anything else we know half the truth [mn] and never will 

407.45 411.52 A: yeah that's i believe yeah uh yeah that's true they 

411.53 414.76 A: they want to keep everything kind of hush hush and that's it 

413.51 418.81 B: well you know [cough] i don't what'd happen if people ever knew the truth i don't know that 

419.59 425.08 B: ah you know half of the people in this country could handle whatever the truth really is 

424.87 426.57 A: yeah that's true yeah 

425.25 431.99 B: i i you know i mean i don't know we've been so protected [mn] all our lives kind of thing and um 

432.25 436.90 B: [mn] i don't know [laughter] you know so i guess it's kind of like you know 

434.33 435.12 A: yeah 

437.28 443.03 B: [mn] w- we feel like as a people that it's better to ke- as long as it's in another country 

443.19 446.43 B: [mn] it's acceptable [mn] and [mn] 

446.49 449.63 B: of course because we're there you know w- we 

449.40 464.02 B: i think we like to see ourselves as the humanitarians anyways [sigh] at at any cost you know like [mn] matter how much money we lose or how bad it is for our economy or anything like that we're we're going to support them 

461.89 462.71 A: (( uh )) 

463.99 466.29 A: yeah that's true yeah mm 

465.44 471.28 B: [mn] so so taxes will be going up [laughter] [laughter] count on it [mn] 

467.95 469.78 A: (( oh yes definitely [laughter] )) 

470.14 473.75 A: yeah we'll definitely yes we'll definitely be paying more taxes 

473.19 484.54 B: don't be looking for that little refund [laughter] you know like they did there a couple of years ago [laughter] where everybody got a little bit back they're going to be taking twice as much i don't know [mn] 

474.69 478.83 A: [laughter] no that's true yeah [laughter] 

483.77 487.25 A: yeah yeah we'll be paying that's true more taxes 

485.89 486.73 B: but 

486.84 494.09 B: [mn] but it's kind of like too i mean [mn] it's almost like you just know it's like it's g- they're going to bite the hand that feeds 'em 

493.86 496.29 A: well yeah that's true yeah 

494.54 504.01 B: i mean i- you know you can't impose you can't impose your lifestyle and your beliefs and whatnot [mn] on someone else you know you just [mn] 

502.08 506.37 A: that's true yeah yeah that's true yeah very true mm 

505.99 508.58 B: you know and like it's like we'll 

508.60 517.71 B: [mn] people will probably put up with so much for so long until they start to get on their feet a little bit and feel a little safer and [sigh] you know the [sigh] 

517.48 524.40 B: getting back to more like whatever their normal life kind of thing is [mn] and then they're going to turn around and say you know 

517.51 519.23 A: right 

521.83 522.70 A: uh-huh 

524.20 533.62 B: we don't need you anymore and you know we're not going to pay you back like has happened to us before [laughter] and all that kind of stuff so
