1.18 2.42 B: hi 

1.96 3.64 A: hi this is laura 

3.24 5.15 B: laura hi this is edetia 

5.11 7.18 A: (( hi edetia how are you tonight )) 

6.62 8.20 B: i'm well how about you 

7.74 13.09 A: oh i'm good i can't believe they have they called on easter though it surprised me [laughter] 

8.98 9.54 B: (( [mn] )) 

11.73 14.43 B: yeah i know definitely 

13.82 16.50 A: [laughter] guess they're trying to get all their calls in 

15.99 17.15 B: (( defin- yeah )) 

16.56 21.63 A: yeah okay so we're supposed to talk about airforce security tonight huh 

21.14 22.44 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

21.74 23.84 A: how many other topics have you had 

23.26 25.16 B: um this is actually my first call 

24.56 28.89 A: oh is it this is my third one [laughter] 

25.18 26.43 B: yes 

27.19 30.53 B: oh [laughter] so you only get three right i think 

29.71 33.47 A: (( well it you know i was reading on the thing and it's like )) 

33.54 39.22 A: i don't know it's like i think there's three but then there's like they said are you willing to take more 

37.57 39.93 B: option of getting more right 

39.36 44.65 A: so i have no idea i guess i'll find out if i get another one after i talk to you [laughter] 

43.29 45.15 B: right right [laughter] 

45.88 51.93 A: okay so so do you think that the airforce security helps lessen terrorist attacks 

51.29 52.46 B: um 

53.30 60.67 B: yes and no uh i guess terrorist attacks in this case they they mean by you know hijacking airplanes 

60.19 61.30 A: right 

60.64 75.11 B: um et cetera but i always felt that you know if if someone wants to do it then they'll find a way around it um in any case uh it just makes it a little bit more harder maybe a little bit more costly for terrorist um 

75.07 77.83 B: if they're funded well then you know 

77.93 81.63 B: what's to stop them from getting their own plane and doing the same thing um 

80.68 81.85 A: right 

81.74 95.96 B: i was actually um i had been to the airport a- about a month ago um and you know i got searched and everything like that and the searchers searchers are pretty thorough so um i'm not worried about people trying to sneak 

95.95 102.12 B: uh past you know with anything metal but then again you know there's there's plastic um 

102.27 109.66 B: you know people can make guns out of plastic i mean things like that could easily get by um so i think 

104.79 105.81 A: right 

109.61 117.62 B: the the best way to for something like this to to be under control would be just more heightened awareness by people in general 

117.49 125.51 A: that's a i would i would definitely agree with you on that because there are a l- i mean and i and i do have to say though that the security though 

125.63 137.27 A: we you know as civilians we really have no idea how many things have been caught you know that are just not advertised i have uh i have several friends who are pilots in the 

131.20 132.53 B: (( mhm right )) 

137.19 141.09 A: civilian air world and then also pilots in the military world 

140.06 140.93 B: mhm 

140.97 153.20 A: and it it really is amazing how much that it's just you know it's because they don't want to scare everybody to death that they'll never fly again you know the stuff just isn't advertised it's like oh they've taken care of it you know and that type deal 

146.41 147.54 B: right 

151.71 155.48 B: yeah everything is always ri- put under you know 

154.69 160.11 A: right and so i mean i d- i do think it helps but i'm i would also have to agree with you that 

160.13 166.50 A: you know there's just so many times that people continually try and try and try that eventually 

164.46 165.46 B: right 

165.75 168.23 B: something happens and gets through 

167.87 171.91 A: that's it yeah eventually something will happen and get through 

171.15 171.71 B: (( [cough] )) 

172.23 174.06 A: and i think it's you know i think 

174.08 176.96 A: you know we're so much more aware now 

176.75 177.85 B: right 

177.22 179.05 A: than we were before 

179.18 187.26 A: you know and i think that makes all the difference in the world you know you talk to people who fly nowadays and i mean you know they're really more aware of their surroundings 

179.19 179.93 B: right 

185.96 193.75 B: right i mean n- no one's like you know always it's not always good just to mind your own business i mean uh some sense of awareness is definitely necessary 

192.76 204.35 A: exactly whereas you know before on an airplane it would just be like you know oh who cares i used to yeah i used to travel a lot and i would never speak to anybody i could be asleep before we even taxied 

197.49 199.02 B: whatever yeah exactly 

200.01 201.21 B: mhm 

203.84 204.80 B: right 

204.15 209.44 A: then i would sleep all the way until we got at the gate you know i don't do that so much any more 

208.50 210.70 B: (( [laughter] )) 

210.22 212.67 A: [laughter] you know 

212.96 214.08 A: so uh 

214.13 221.73 A: you know i but i mean i do think i do think that it that it helps but i don't think that we can protect ourselves 

218.52 219.45 B: mhm 

221.55 232.68 B: right right no i com- i completely agree i mean i guess in a sense like there's a larger issue at hand here um and that's something that isn't gonna go away any time soon 

222.37 223.43 A: you know 

228.05 228.92 A: right 

232.70 233.74 A: right 

233.12 235.04 B: and you know as long as 

235.58 246.45 B: there are su- there is such a strong uh opposition out there then you know they'll find a way i mean this this sort of thing has been going on in the middle east for centuries you know you could say 

245.91 250.09 A: exactly yeah and and it's just something we're not used to it 

246.71 248.40 B: uh you know it's not 

249.30 253.79 B: right it's not something new but it's just something that hasn't um so deeply affect us 

253.07 264.42 A: yeah it's it's new in our country here yeah yeah we we went to israel a number of years ago and we were amazed that when the kids were on uh field trips the chaperones had had automatic weapons 

261.15 262.38 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

263.77 265.68 B: right i mean it's defin- 

264.81 275.41 A: you know yeah you're just w- and it's like course the kids didn't misbehave either i i thought it was a form of discipline [laughter] you know [laughter] but but yes exactly see other 

266.10 267.39 B: (( but )) 

269.11 271.42 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

275.23 287.08 A: countries have just they've always lived with this and it's a way of life you know we've just kinda been very sheltered you know and and then of course had a very rude awakening you know to what the rest of the world 

277.54 278.50 B: right 

281.00 282.65 B: mhm 

286.27 288.00 B: yes definitely 

287.39 290.33 A: deals with you know on a normal basis 

290.42 296.45 A: with that said it drives me absolutely bonkers that they will not let me take my pocketknife on the airplane [laughter] [mn] 

295.44 302.00 B: right and and little things i mean like a pair of scissors and like sometimes nail clippers like you know they 

300.52 301.74 A: yeah 

302.17 312.63 A: i have a girlfriend she's a pilot for a major airline and it absolutely drives her nuts they are she does needlework you know when she's on a layover and they're al- constantly taking her needlepoint scissors away 

304.50 305.39 B: mhm 

307.94 309.07 B: (( uh-huh [sigh] )) 

311.77 314.01 B: [laughter] 

313.44 324.72 A: [laughter] you know they're just constantly doing it and it just irritates her to no end you know she's like do you realise i have a crash axe right behind me in the cockpit if i wanted to do something you know 

317.50 319.79 B: right oh i can imagine 

322.45 337.09 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah i mean for a a exactly i mean for pilots and um you know people who have to go through it every single day it just it must be like you know something just such a pain i guess to do it but a necessary evil nonetheless 

324.78 325.60 A: [laughter] 

334.49 335.72 A: yeah 

336.64 338.40 A: well i was reading the thing

349.06 350.62 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

349.85 354.21 B: come on honestly some of the people like but you know then again 

354.31 363.95 B: if s- if something if a terrorist were to go over there and say he was a secret service agent you don't want him to you know easily get through i mean there has to be some kind of 

360.52 361.39 A: well 

361.94 362.86 A: be that 

363.34 372.83 A: that's that's exactly it you know it's like they're just you know they don't really know that you know you may have i._d. but they don't know that you're truly a pilot or that you're 

364.07 364.84 B: check 

371.49 372.34 B: right 

372.96 376.51 A: you know or that you're anything else that that you say you are 

375.91 378.82 B: right i mean y- yeah 

378.44 381.37 A: yeah i got caught oh just a couple of months ago 

381.50 394.59 A: uh my husband and i both put the buzzers off and we had two small children with us and they and one of them's a two year old girl and they kept telling my daughter don't touch your mother and i'm like okay you guys get a grip on reality here you know 

385.63 386.57 B: mhm 

390.18 391.26 B: [laughter] 

392.47 395.31 B: [laughter] 

394.61 404.93 A: [laughter] my shoes set off the beeper take my shoes away you know oh yeah it was just my i g- i had new boots and they had buckles on 'em and it set off the beeper

403.70 405.09 B: oh okay 

405.06 410.96 A: and i wasn't smart enough now i know i always take my shoes off now and i just put 'em through the x-ray 

410.41 416.56 B: yeah i mean you might as well i think i was um flying out of newark airport and they make everybody do that now 

416.07 417.22 A: do they 

416.69 417.97 B: yeah 

417.33 423.98 A: yeah it's just it's phenomenal you know what i mean it's like you know so by the time you take off your jewellery you take off your belt you take off your shoes [laughter] 

422.35 424.76 B: i know and then then there's a big backup 

424.57 437.71 B: i mean i was i was actually very surprised i had set aside about three hours before my flight was to leave for me to like you know leave my house get to the airport and go through all security i figured it would take you know forever but it actually 

436.26 437.43 A: right 

437.68 439.61 B: it went through pretty smoothly i mean 

439.73 446.40 B: yeah there was a little bit of a delay but it you know five ten minutes here and there it wasn't too bad i wasn't that disappointed in mhm 

444.20 445.27 A: yeah 

446.27 448.98 A: i really i haven't had any major 

449.32 455.75 A: security delays i think it was like you know probably not too long after september eleventh that i flew 

455.96 459.32 A: and that was let's see at that point i was flying out of san diego 

459.37 469.27 A: and uh i did get caught and but that and that took like two hours but that was the long- but that was the longest one and it's never i've never had that problem since 

463.83 464.91 B: oh wow 

468.67 470.97 B: mhm do you fly often 

469.62 470.70 A: you know 

470.99 485.29 A: i well i mean just casual flying i mean it i mean to hear me it sounds like i fly a lot but i didn't really think i do but uh you know i i don't know every few months we you know might go some place or you know i might meet a girlfriend for the weekend or something 

476.29 477.19 B: right 

477.50 479.18 B: [laughter] 

481.73 483.47 B: go somewhere right 

485.26 486.14 A: um 

486.18 488.74 A: i don't fly too much international any more 

488.15 502.95 B: mhm yeah i haven't left the country since for a few years now so i'm actually planning on uh going up to canada soon so i i'm interested to see how the um security up there across the boarder is working 

489.15 490.50 A: you know it's just like 

493.04 494.26 A: yeah 

502.31 508.14 A: yeah 'cause i had see i haven't crossed any like that type of local boarders or anything recently 

506.04 506.89 B: mhm 

506.98 507.94 B: right 

507.99 511.23 B: i mean i i i'm pretty sure it's completely different um 

511.28 514.31 B: in terms of getting across the mexican or canadian boarder 

513.73 522.02 A: oh yeah and unfortunately i'm afraid if you don't look it like a typical caucasian american that they think of what a 

519.97 520.88 B: mhm 

522.15 524.71 A: typical caucasian american should look like 

524.02 527.70 B: right i mean there's definite- there's definitely some profiling involved and 

527.10 528.50 A: oh yeah 

528.16 537.58 B: i i guess you know in order to save time in all aspects i i mean it's kind of necessary but to what point you know is is legal in fact you know 

535.38 536.53 A: i know 

537.10 552.07 A: yeah i know and i and i have to say i feel i'm the classic caucasian person you know i can i look like everybody else you know so i don't have any trouble but i have to say if i you know i was if i was a third or fourth generation you know arab american or middle east american 

541.35 542.22 B: mhm 

545.09 546.09 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

550.46 551.30 B: right 

552.25 556.81 A: it i mean even though you know that has to be done i would still have a hard time 

554.78 557.56 B: mhm it's it's still back in your mind 

557.00 559.71 A: it would i would have a hard time you know 

558.82 566.80 B: exactly i mean um i mean i'm indian and uh but i was born here and uh and it's com- yeah it's completely and then 

563.25 565.54 A: right so yeah so you're american 

566.88 581.46 B: see and then like you go to the airport and then you know you get randomly screened um and then you wonder always in the back of your mind you know were you randomly chosen or was there some kind of process so so things like that are always gonna stick with you and it's just the way it it works 

575.34 576.64 A: right 

579.68 591.72 A: yeah now my husband he's he's funny he's been randomly caught several times and he's like what is it you know and again he looks like your typical you know white guy going through the airport you know 

590.05 591.31 B: right right 

591.66 595.07 A: and you know but so at least he knows that his is random 

594.38 598.21 B: right right but then there's always the other people who mhm 

595.44 596.45 A: you know 

597.58 599.89 A: exactly and i have to say it would
