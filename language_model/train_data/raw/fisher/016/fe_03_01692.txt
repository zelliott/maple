31.50 36.98 A: well i think we've pretty much created the problem over there they they don't hate our guts 

37.22 39.98 A: because we've been nice to them and ah 

40.02 41.96 A: when you have 

42.99 52.82 A: families that rule countries and saudi arabia's a good example of the house of sayid over there is 

52.97 57.20 A: worth billions of dollars most of it not because of oil it's because of

62.15 66.47 A: and the other people that aren't in on this money are kinda upset at us and 

66.53 67.39 A: (( ah )) 

68.22 76.47 A: and i think they've been upsad- upset at us for a long time and we've done the same thing basically with egypt we buy off the royal heir the 

76.56 78.81 A: the ruling families and ah 

79.62 83.01 A: and leave everybody else goes flat broke so 

83.09 86.06 A: i think they want american influence out 

86.36 90.65 A: and ah they can't declare war on us and invade us so they ah 

91.16 97.48 A: they wind up with a bunch of people that are madder than the other part of the people and they come over here and fly into our buildings 

97.38 102.58 B: [laughter] you seem more informed than just about everyone that i've talked to on this subject 

102.77 104.04 A: oh i've been 

102.86 104.03 B: that ah 

106.00 112.87 B: that's just oh [sigh] that's kinda refreshing um most of what i hear around here's you know some 

109.80 111.13 A: (( well that's good )) 

113.24 117.48 B: some sort of patriotic diatribe about how we're ridding the world of evil 

117.35 129.55 B: and how we're and how we're a how we're a mor- a super moral america i mean it's it's okay to be you know to do good things like that but yeah i think they are upset about ah our imperialism 

117.75 118.76 A: (( well )) 

118.85 120.00 A: (( we )) 

127.82 128.84 A: the peop- 

129.17 141.83 A: the people of america are no more righteous than the people of any other country they are all about the same it's a very small ruling elitist 

141.85 153.28 A: money banker clique that rules any and each country and america has been keeping little countries in line for years and years and years by buying their elitists 

153.34 156.88 A: that's what foreign aid is [laughter] 

156.25 166.15 B: exactly i think that's ah probably what we're doing here is there's ah i don't know an instability in oil prices from ah from terrorism which ah 

166.67 180.04 B: [sigh] we can't put our oil supplier or oil bandwidth in jeopardy so i guess that's worth ah some people's lives to go over there and set up a ah a new government that will sell us oil at a cheaper price 

179.98 182.87 B: and ah give us stability in that market 

182.88 186.44 B: if we can't get it from whoever the current leaders are 

186.54 200.71 A: well we we did punch a bully in the nose and i'm always happy to see a bully get punched in the nose but other countries are happy to see a bully get punched in the nose too and it happened to be us and they did it to the trade center 

201.28 204.49 A: and that's a sad that's a sad commentary 

201.30 202.31 B: well they 

204.50 209.76 A: they can't punch the way we do so they have to be sneaky about it [laughter] 

210.12 212.39 A: but we bully with money 

212.55 216.77 B: i agree i agree we've got a ah we've got a lot of weight to throw around 

216.85 217.92 B: (( and ah )) 

218.44 230.17 B: i'm not sure that the problems will ever be resolved although as much ah quote unquote headways we're making with the ah [laughter] liberation of these different countries 

230.22 243.20 B: um it seems we go pick off the middle eastern countries one by one and set things ah set up u._s. governments there ah will likely you know kill our own wars and ah 

242.21 246.82 A: puppet government puppet government puppet governments [laughter] 

246.21 251.41 B: exactly everywhere if we can set up enough of them 

247.02 248.02 A: yeah 

248.50 250.06 A: or the united nations 

251.00 252.39 A: i i ah 

252.33 254.41 B: or the united nations is that what you said 

254.74 259.60 A: yeah the united nations is just a a bunch of crummy stupid countries that 

259.75 262.63 A: that two thirds of which are on our 

263.14 264.86 A: foreign money 

265.21 267.98 A: bail out scheme anyway so 

267.63 273.40 B: yeah i think ah a ah did a ah billion dollar developer zachendorf 

268.19 269.08 A: that's 

273.52 280.64 B: built the u._n. building and ah seventy ah per cent of the funding for the u._n. comes from the u._s. 

273.90 274.99 A: [laughter] 

280.70 283.51 B: and ah i heard that there's some rumor that ah 

283.68 289.68 B: ah it surely it's a joke that ah the u._s. wants to form it's own u._n. [laughter] and call it the u._n. two 

290.25 291.60 A: (( well )) 

290.37 293.81 B: where the cabinet is the chief members 

293.44 306.75 A: if we did what we were supposed to every screaming bloody liberal in the whole world would say we were becoming isolationist what we should do is say we'd be willing to talk to you about anything you want to but ah 

306.54 312.63 A: from now on ah the building is ours our money is ours you can do whatever you want to please stay in touch 

312.68 316.40 A: then they would call us isolationist even though we have the 

316.22 325.96 A: largest adversarial staff in the world and we do more commerce with other countries than all the other countries in the world combined they would still try and label us as becoming 

325.76 334.00 A: isolationist and that's exactly what we should do let the am- ambassadors take care of it and let our business people take care of it of 

334.40 349.25 B: yeah we could sustain ourselves for a while i'm not sure how long but ah i'm i agree i think trade would ah would still go on and resume and i i think the almighty dollar would ah overpower their ah their hatred 

342.50 343.53 A: course it would 

349.84 360.60 A: tr- tr- try this for for a theory if not fact in nineteen thirteen we came up with the federal reserve system which is neither federal nor has there ever been any reserves 

360.05 363.65 B: right it's a private bank and it's ah run by 

362.51 367.09 A: it's a bunch of inter- international private bankers 

366.39 378.02 B: yeah it's called the ah it's ah it has another secret organization called the i._m._f. whose members we're not ah aware of and ah are privately elected and control ah the world markets 

377.96 385.72 A: right every country has a similar system the treasury department bil- ah prints treasury notes they sell the tre- 

385.66 392.92 A: the feds sell the treasury notes and they sell them sell them to whoever wants to buy them and loan the money 

392.81 404.44 A: loan the money out and they keep all the interest and if a little country doesn't do everything they're supposed to they loan them money until they start doing what they're supposed to and if the little country can't pay it back again then they ah 

404.43 409.57 A: tell the little country well here's some more money as long as we keep our interest ah we're doing fine 

409.59 410.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

411.66 415.78 B: so do you think it'll ah we'll ever get an end to ah the war 

415.75 416.86 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

415.93 418.76 B: (( or do you see ongoing wars )) 

417.28 427.70 A: no i think there will be well planned continuous wars for the rest of mankind's time on earth i think most of them have planned been planned by the 

427.46 436.36 A: basically the same family of people and i think until they're exposed it will continue to happen and there's not a thing we can do about it because 

436.21 448.51 A: if you vote for a republican or vote for a democrat they're both being controlled by the same group of people they're the ones in upper pincer the other one is a lower pincer and we're in the middle being pinched 

448.54 451.02 B: [laughter] 

449.82 459.23 A: so teach your kids that this is a republic and it has a constitution and the federal government has no authority to give or loan money to anybody 

459.45 466.43 B: it's funny ah that most people think that this is ah a democracy and i agree i'd say ah that both ah 

467.07 474.52 B: both democrats and republicans do serve the same master and ah it's it's very 

471.09 472.29 A: (( that's true )) 

474.58 476.14 B: upsetting to 

476.02 477.47 B: learn what ah 

477.30 492.06 B: what little we can do about it and how complacent we are in our own lives just as americans to sit home and watch t._v. and buy the latest products and see what comes on i mean what we're complaining about is our sitcoms while the rest of the world is complaining about where their next meal's coming from 

485.07 486.95 A: that's right 

491.98 495.96 A: i don't watch sitcoms but i understand 

492.19 493.41 B: (( and ah )) 

494.94 507.12 B: yeah and the entire time you know we get to subjugate other countries and hold them under ah you know economic duress and see who we can bully and see if we can stay on top and control all the resour- resources 

507.49 512.80 B: it's a it's interesting would you rather live in another country like ah if you had the option 

512.82 515.01 A: absolutely not 

515.34 516.51 B: so um 

516.63 527.05 B: see do you agree with ah with our actions maybe not our ah our reasoning or maybe not what we say we're doing it for but do you agree with ah us going to 

526.83 531.75 B: planning all these little strategic wars and going after oil and resources 

529.72 530.66 A: (( um )) 

532.25 545.71 A: i think that america has enough oil reserves to last us for another thirty forty or forty years and after that oil will be a something that you tell your kids we used to use 

545.80 546.57 B: [laughter] 

546.49 558.64 A: there is enough oil in the north slope to keep this country going with sweet good oil for a long time and it's not a pit person that's afraid of insulting a caribou that's keeping us from pumping it 

559.36 560.17 B: (( [laughter] )) 

560.52 564.99 B: what do you think's keeping it from us do we want to consume the mid east's oil supply 

565.04 566.50 B: first 

566.19 578.70 A: well no we have those countries in control and we control them by buying their product and i don't think that's the the complete picture to it but i have a the 

578.90 586.36 A: i spent some time in alaska and i know caribous aren't much different than a cow is and cows don't mind watching people 

586.49 599.90 A: saw logs or set topers or anything else they're pretty aloof to the whole thing but there's a there's a bunch of land up there that the feds illegally owned and it's called a a i forget what it's called
