129.44 131.16 B: [laughter] 

130.27 134.60 A: oh really it's just like a minority of the people 

131.37 133.20 B: yeah she says 

134.25 140.26 B: yeah she says she doesn't know where they're finding these people because what she sees is completely opposite of that 

139.72 143.16 A: this should go down on a list everybody would love to hear that 

142.55 144.43 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

143.67 154.30 A: that would make i've got to tell my girlfriend's son is over somewhere she just knows he was sent to kuwait but she has no idea where he is he's like twenty one

152.19 154.78 B: oh she's she doesn't hear from him

160.53 161.64 B: mhm 

161.05 171.07 A: and his wife didn't tell him and so she's like you know i think they changed it so they'd notify the family if something happens too but he hasn't called or anything 

170.93 175.26 B: oh well maybe he's in an area where he doesn't have the ability to do that 

171.37 172.35 A: (( and )) 

174.48 179.56 A: yeah but she'll that'll make her feel better to tell her to hear that

185.42 192.68 A: i feel we're still in afghanistan i i can't i i think it would be a miracle to get out for under a year 

192.46 193.31 B: mhm 

192.65 202.31 A: i mean we're going to have to have americans over there w- not just to keep the peace but i think they're going to need people over there to um 

203.81 206.62 A: to advise in peace 

206.87 211.31 A: you know 'cause they don't how to do a democracy and 

211.45 214.05 A: and all this stuff um 

213.16 213.90 B: right 

215.40 217.47 A: and all that but a- 

217.80 226.63 A: a- as you know probably more the advisors or you know i think it's going to take a while to get everybody out like they're still finding 

226.74 227.92 A: um 

228.07 231.97 A: what do they call those people um bin laden is 

232.29 233.54 A: al qaeda 

232.78 234.19 B: (( al qaeda yes )) 

233.58 240.23 A: they're still finding them in afghanistan you know at least they tell us more what's going on over there too 

240.04 241.25 B: (( yeah a- )) 

240.34 249.47 A: but they're still they're still there and um i think it's going to take a while to get 'em and and you know they might not ever get 'em all 

249.54 251.15 B: no no they won't 

249.73 260.89 A: but but it's gonna i think it i think we're going to be there a while but not you know the force that they have but i did find it interesting that they bought two carriers home and then 

260.91 270.63 A: somebody said they thought they were shipping out [laughter] a- another you know somebody they knew was just got shipped out over there from washington 

269.38 278.01 B: oh yeah well uh they always rotate 'em because you know some of the the guys on the lincoln they'd been out for over nine months and they all have families so it mi- 

270.87 271.84 A: (( you know )) 

272.53 273.87 A: yeah 

275.64 276.53 A: yeah 

277.10 282.16 A: but they didn't they didn't say that they were rotating they said they were bringing 'em home 

282.12 288.28 B: oh well they are bringing them ho- they're bringing some home um the carl vincent's supposed to be coming home 

288.33 290.81 B: uh they're over in korea 

290.45 291.68 A: mhm 

291.14 305.57 B: um and then s- shoot we live near a navy base so i'm trying [laughter] to figure out what else but there were um there are people coming home b- but they're they're going to be on a rotation for a while and it i kind of feel sorry for all the people who were forward deployed because 

296.10 297.09 A: (( really )) 

305.37 311.84 B: they're going to be out a lot more than i think they had planned to be [laughter] yeah but um it's k- 

308.90 310.10 A: yeah 

310.61 313.87 A: m- we were kind of scared my son in law's in the 

314.46 316.14 A: (( in the um )) 

316.78 318.23 A: reserves 

318.15 319.45 B: mhm 

318.77 324.65 A: and he he was you know we were afraid he was going to get called up 'cause he's got young children too 

324.51 325.41 B: right 

325.44 328.48 A: and uh and i was just ah 

329.46 331.60 A: really concerned 

332.02 339.47 A: about uh him going because when he went to boot camp his son wasn't even 

339.81 340.49 A: (( e- )) 

340.50 345.19 A: eighteen months old and he just he would not talk 

342.32 343.25 B: yeah 

345.39 351.81 A: you know he just it it affected him so much that he refused to even try 

351.98 353.28 A: to talk 

353.86 359.41 A: and um he still his speech he's five now and his speech isn't normal 

359.32 360.35 B: (( uh-oh yeah )) 

359.50 362.66 A: now now there there might be something wrong with him but 

362.72 366.07 A: but and then on top of it terry got hurt 

366.39 369.47 B: oh that's hard for a kid to understand 

367.47 368.52 A: and 

368.96 371.93 A: yeah and so um 

371.97 378.86 A: he's got he hurt his back so i don't think they will take him anyway but we're kind of glad to see it 

379.04 380.49 A: (( spe- w- )) 

380.56 382.18 A: winding down 

382.15 382.97 B: oh 

382.30 383.27 A: (( you know )) 

383.10 394.21 B: yeah i don't know my brother's a reserve he got called up but he works they called him up to take a place in penalton so somebody else could go and he was kind of raring to go he was like you know wanted to be over there 

383.81 384.74 A: (( so )) 

394.31 398.45 B: but of course his wife's there so that might have do [laughter] make some difference but 

394.38 395.46 A: yeah 

397.56 399.93 A: oh yeah i'm sure [laughter] 

399.26 400.79 B: yeah but um 

400.12 404.64 A: yeah it's the separation from family that's hard terry would go 

404.64 418.90 A: he wouldn't you know he wouldn't question it but it's just you know 'cause of the kids but 'cause that's what he signed up for and then he got hurt and he's got this thing wrong with his back now i c- i don't even know how he's working 

407.18 408.35 B: mhm 

418.68 419.62 B: (( yeah oh )) 

419.51 421.14 A: but um 

419.93 420.97 B: (( that's rough )) 

421.24 425.55 B: that's rough well uh like you said though it did have to be done 

425.67 433.66 A: yeah i think so i think so because if if we didn't go get him we the the twin towers was just the start 

425.78 428.37 B: you know and and it's got to be 

433.45 436.22 B: right exactly the ones that they 

434.53 441.25 A: you know and if they don't get it's like now i'm i'm kind of concerned about syria are we going to have to do the same thing 

440.77 443.52 B: oh yeah we are [laughter] 

441.30 450.79 A: you know because we're going to have because they've got the terrorists over there too and they know that and and i'm like okay this is it looks like 

445.56 446.84 B: that's right 

451.01 453.16 A: like um bush is 

454.37 457.45 A: globe trotting kind of but 

456.02 456.99 B: mhm 

457.46 459.21 A: it you know 

459.24 463.85 A: it it's hard to say you know of course syria hasn't really 

464.42 468.47 A: done anything really bad against us like iraq was you know 

468.54 472.96 B: well i think they'll find 'em [laughter] i think they'll find it you know [laughter] 

469.72 470.57 A: but 

471.97 477.90 A: yeah i think if i think if syria's smart they'll just let people in and get rid of their stuff 

477.50 478.66 B: yeah 

478.06 479.74 A: you know [laughter] 

479.29 483.11 B: yeah i think so too but i i think that we're going after 'em anyway 

480.88 481.59 A: (( right )) 

483.08 488.73 A: but i liked the way bush did it you know i like the idea that he tried to 

483.28 484.04 B: (( a- )) 

485.29 486.58 B: yeah me too 

488.94 497.27 A: you know pinpoint things and it's like the russians i thought it was funny when they left because they said um 

499.27 501.59 A: um what was it 

501.60 507.83 A: oh they said that war was getting too close to them and somebody says yeah like what was was there uh 

507.88 518.43 A: uh weapons parked outside your door and they're like yeah [laughter] you know well what do you expect and then one of the neighborhoods where they found that missile did you see that picture 

512.48 513.36 B: (( [mn] )) 

513.75 514.54 B: (( well pu- )) 

518.11 518.98 B: huh-uh 

518.72 527.68 A: right in the middle of a housing area they found there was a missile there and they said it they were so scared that they'd get bombed because that missile was there 

525.74 526.90 B: (( oh wow )) 

527.94 534.20 B: well putin's evil so i mean [laughter] he just is he's an evil guy so [laughter] it's a 

530.90 532.10 A: yeah 

533.31 534.87 A: oh who is that 

534.63 538.03 B: vladimir putin the head guy over in russia 

537.31 539.57 A: oh that's russia yeah 

538.76 540.16 B: yeah he's evil 

540.32 541.09 B: so 

540.40 541.72 A: yeah 

541.12 544.46 B: [laughter] um i'm really glad bush is in office it's just [mn] 

543.03 549.40 A: i don't know a whole lot about him but yeah and i've got more confidence in him than i have in a president in a long time 

549.04 555.23 B: yeah that's exactly it i can't remember ever in my lifetime trusting a president i 

550.50 551.52 A: (( you know )) 

554.92 559.86 A: yeah i think i kind of trusted carter a little bit 

555.35 556.79 B: mean i certainly 

558.61 563.85 B: w- well but carter was so naive and the people he surrounded himself with 

560.18 562.80 A: but he was yeah 

563.87 573.66 B: were did not have the purest of intentions [laughter] but i mean car- carter himself was smart you know you you figure a nuclear physicist 

567.26 568.47 A: yeah 

568.51 569.70 A: that's true 

572.59 574.85 A: (( uh-huh and ford was )) 

575.58 578.02 A: okay but [laughter] 

576.36 578.79 B: [laughter] 

578.23 583.04 A: but i didn't have bush you just i just got a lot of confidence in him 

582.70 584.98 B: yeah me too and it it 

583.55 586.32 A: (( you know i think he knows he seems to know what he's doing )) 

585.02 588.20 B: it's kind of scary to actually trust somebody you know 

588.11 599.89 A: oh when i heard this thing on the radio this blurb and it was a story about this guy that that in world war two he was um his plane was shot down 

588.24 589.38 B: (( [laughter] yeah ))
