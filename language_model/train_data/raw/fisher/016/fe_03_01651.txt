0.24 1.86 A: yeah i'm dan 

1.60 3.71 B: hi dan i'm holly 

3.37 4.72 A: okay 

4.31 5.81 B: where are you from 

5.65 7.53 A: ah minnesota 

6.91 9.39 B: okay and i'm in california 

9.14 10.63 A: okay 

10.75 12.71 A: um ye- um 

12.76 15.05 A: how do you stand on the middle east 

15.31 28.97 B: well i mean i stand on different issues on the middle east differently but um we could start by by how did you feel about um america's involvement in the recent war in iraq 

18.89 19.87 A: (( oh )) 

29.09 34.91 A: ah now i f- i i feel that it was unbridled aggression on our part 

34.44 36.39 B: i totally agree with you 

37.06 38.57 A: um 

37.09 40.98 B: i thought it was outrageous and totally inappropriate 

40.32 49.50 A: yeah it w- here's something that ah well bush was sabota- h- he was talking out of both sides of his mouth first he was talking peace 

49.70 53.81 A: then he was sabotaging it by talking military and i- w- 

54.03 65.73 A: i- it's just a house of cards over there you take one person out and um it could seriously ah destabilize that entire area 

64.97 66.21 B: as it did 

69.01 77.79 B: and um i and the thing is is that he kept changing even his rationale for us going in 

77.53 78.75 A: yeah 

78.15 88.98 B: um and you know the weap- weapons of mass destruction were never found um if they find something i think it could be a plant 

88.66 94.85 A: ah as far as i know they found some agricultural pesticides 

94.29 106.57 B: right but i mean everybody's entitled to have agriculture pesticides um [mn] and the other thing is that in the war although they kept saying how they were going to make every attempt to 

98.34 99.52 A: yes 

106.67 110.78 B: ah avoid civilian casualties even the 

110.81 112.02 B: the 

112.04 119.16 B: terminology that they used for the initial aerial part of the bombing was shock and awe 

118.78 119.94 A: uh-huh 

119.27 121.92 B: and that is 

122.15 137.08 B: so morally reprehensible especially after hiroshima and nagasaki to even use those words to talk about something wh- and everything they did to me seemed to violate the geneva convention 

128.87 130.76 A: yes i agree 

137.35 148.42 B: because when they bombed the building that they thought saddam hussein and his sons might be in they knew that there were innocent people in that building at the same time and they didn't care 

148.80 151.26 A: w- um w- what about the museum 

151.40 153.12 B: oh well the and 

151.47 153.79 A: they they could they they could've 

153.22 161.96 B: that is horrendous to lose all those antiquities to not to not do anything to prevent all this unrest and looting 

154.91 155.95 A: yes 

162.62 167.42 A: and that we we had the capability to p- to ah prevent it 

167.24 168.20 B: right 

167.52 170.26 A: we had we didn't care 

169.66 182.52 B: no we didn't care we didn't ca- we didn't care how many people we killed and who we killed and we haven't even proved that we got saddam hussein and what right do we have to assassinate him anyway even if we hate him 

170.75 171.75 A: most of the 

174.69 175.52 A: (( no yeah )) 

181.02 186.81 A: well ye- he wa- he was um legally ah elected 

185.21 187.39 B: the leader of that country 

186.89 188.12 A: twice 

188.75 189.60 B: right 

189.91 195.08 B: oh and if they say he his elections were fixed what about our recent elections 

194.41 199.86 A: [mn] yeah it well wh- what about bin laden we haven't even capture him yet 

199.46 205.94 B: right exactly but yet we murdered all the people in afghanistan i don't know i mean [mn] 

206.05 212.95 B: to me it seems like we're we're on a course of genocide in the middle east worse 

212.85 225.73 B: than the suicide bombers of palestine worse than the aggression that israel does in retaliation for suicide bombing and i think what we're doing has less 

225.89 235.30 B: moral justification than the outrageous acts that those other countries or groups do because we're not living there 

235.70 246.45 A: [noise] it's just really hard for us to ha- to have the moral and the morals and the right to do these thi- these things over there 

246.23 251.87 A: they've existed for thousands of years we don't i i don't believe no i 

250.48 257.80 B: we don't even understand their culture and they have and they c- even the muslims there can't even agree with each other 

252.64 253.67 A: (( know )) 

257.89 263.60 B: and the- they have a lot of dissent among the muslims of the different sects 

263.31 264.32 A: yeah 

263.63 270.56 B: and and um i think it's there's just going to be more of a bloodbath this reminds of 

270.53 283.57 B: of historically what happened when the british pulled out of india and the sheiks the hindus and the muslims start who we- were living together peaceably started killing each other 

277.30 278.25 A: yeah 

279.93 282.48 A: yeah pakistan and india yeah 

283.65 295.35 B: because the british divided the country and made made people move from one part to another and everyone was losing their pr- their land and their property and being separated from their loved ones 

283.67 284.93 A: (( yeah )) 

294.57 298.79 A: i have a feeling that's probably what's going to happen right now over in iraq 

298.46 305.24 B: right and and you know it's we're not stopping at iraq now we're threatening syria and lebanon 

304.05 304.96 A: jordan 

305.67 306.85 A: i've heard 

305.82 310.38 B: and it's really i'm really afraid that this is going to lead to world war three 

309.54 311.11 A: well um 

311.25 316.55 A: it it's just yet terrorism has existed um 

316.72 320.88 A: as a way of getting a message across since 

321.73 323.58 A: civilization began 

323.67 326.09 A: we cannot really 

325.75 327.15 B: wipe it out 

326.53 329.53 A: yeah um 

327.77 331.52 B: we can't wipe it out but yet the things we're doing 

331.49 341.21 B: could fall under the category of terrorism too because we did not have the approval of the governing body of the world 

334.55 335.45 A: yes 

340.87 341.87 A: (( the u._n. )) 

341.09 350.30 B: the the diplomacy right center of the world the u._n. yet we did it and as far as i can see our only reasons were economic 

350.14 363.87 B: in terms of being able to control oil in the future and political maintaining a hold on that part of the world so we can continue to have as much oil as we want at the cheapest rates possible and that doesn't justify death 

360.23 361.10 A: well 

363.79 364.86 A: no it doesn't 

363.86 367.93 B: of a nation of it's people and we're doing 

366.28 368.57 A: and it's culture [mn] 

368.00 374.90 B: and there's all those children burnt and mutilated and maimed without antibiotics without water 

375.04 382.49 B: without you know any kind of medicine they said they were cutting people's limbs off without anesthetic it's 

382.27 386.48 A: well yes i understand that um we're 

387.99 389.94 A: it's reprehensible 

389.32 402.37 B: i agree so what do you think we as citizens can do to contain our country's continued involvement in more aggressive acts in that part of the world 

400.89 409.98 A: we- [mn] ah i i really can't think of anything to ah to try and curtail it um 

409.19 417.67 B: and what about the fact that they're trying to pass the patriot act two when the patriot act one is already unconstitutional 

417.27 428.01 A: a- and it and as far as i heard um there has been ah like twenty or thirty states that are actually trying to challenge it 

427.48 429.42 B: [mn] that's wonderful 

429.81 432.09 B: oh that is wonderful 

429.85 430.80 A: (( it jus- )) 

431.75 435.74 A: it's mc- it's mccarthyesque you ah 

434.91 437.33 B: it's worse than mccarthyesque 

436.61 448.30 A: anybody uh if they dissent against the against bush and his group of people can be thrown in prison held indefinitely 

447.69 454.75 B: well that means you and i since we're speaking on a recorded tape [laughter] from the university of pennsylvania 

449.34 450.12 A: yes 

454.65 463.14 A: [sigh] it's just anybody can be c- can be held and labeled as a terrorist any public records are can be seized y- 

462.40 466.02 B: but there's a difference between having a view 

466.04 476.54 B: and doing something to put it into action i think people are entitled to hold whatever view they want but it's highly different if they do an action that's illegal 

473.47 475.53 A: yeah um 

476.13 485.18 A: wh- what about um with ah susan sarandon susan sarandon they she spoke out against the war and th- a- a- a- a- 

478.81 480.51 B: and people should be allowed 

483.77 486.18 B: so did tim robbins her husband 

485.44 491.34 A: yeah and they both have been receiving huge criticism for it 

491.36 500.07 A: but what about the actors that did that um talked out against the ah talked against the american action before the war started 

499.43 502.48 B: right they were trying to keep it us from doing it 

502.07 509.77 A: [mn] they were trying to use diplomacy u- using their forms to encourage diplomacy it didn't work 

504.84 505.75 B: right 

508.13 517.99 B: right in using in using communication negotiation all of these noble things that we should be able to put into practice in this new millennium 

518.07 519.12 A: yes 

518.54 525.04 B: you know here's thousands of years of civilization and we're still just murdering each other 

524.35 534.27 A: yeah i- we sh- w- w- we really should do our best to ensure peace real peace 

535.14 537.39 A: but i don't feel it's going to happen 

537.44 541.76 B: [mn] do you think that he's going to get that bush is going to get re-elected 

541.39 547.41 A: i doubt it because we we haven't he hasn't met his objectives over there 

548.08 554.08 A: he hasn't found bin laden he hasn't found saddam he hasn't found his weapons of mass destruction 

553.76 560.74 B: [mn] but do you think i mean how do people i mean in california there's a lot of of anti 

558.91 561.63 A: well especially with north korea 

560.92 575.90 B: right there's a lot of antiwar sentiment however i worry about the mid west where i was born that there's a lot of and you can tell me because you're from minnesota how most people feel there about the bush administration and our involvement 

574.96 583.36 A: well from the ones i've been able to talk with um they didn't like they didn't like the involvement in the war to begin with 

583.17 593.47 B: right so i'd like to know where where all the polls get this this this two thirds to seventy percent satisfaction with the 

592.78 594.55 A: the corporations 

594.76 598.13 A: the the people that are going to benefit from this war 

597.38 599.89 B: yeah but that's a minority th- if
