76.36 77.75 A: [laughter] 

79.96 83.05 B: it's a it's a crazy time but um 

80.05 81.70 A: mhm 

83.23 85.37 A: yeah i can imagine [mn] yes 

83.44 84.28 B: so 

84.74 91.38 B: so so being originally from turkey does it does it do you follow it more closely what's going on in the middle east 

91.69 102.68 A: yeah in fact i mean especially um [mn] the iraq situation [mn] i was like always um reading the news from turkey and comparing how different they are from the u._s._a. 

96.31 97.03 B: (( mm )) 

102.74 104.30 A: and um 

104.46 116.53 A: yeah i mean [mn] of course i- i don't have like particular ah ideology in terms of u._s._a. or iraq or any other ah countries but um 

114.52 115.48 B: mhm 

117.37 120.80 A: [lipsmack] in general i think everything is a complete play 

120.96 126.75 A: ah on the media that's somehow being um directed by the 

122.61 123.67 B: mhm 

126.95 132.56 A: politics around the world like even in turkey i guess i mean not only in u._s._a. 

130.19 130.95 B: (( mm )) 

131.01 132.05 B: [noise] 

132.59 136.41 A: but even in turk- ah in even in turkey i guess it's more 

136.78 138.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

138.01 147.27 A: like kind of a play i don't know [mn] this is my view in general so i don't have really particularly like oh we should do this in order to that 

141.22 142.49 B: yeah 

147.09 153.19 A: and this will be better and this will turn to be a peace or something like that what about you [laughter] 

151.65 152.76 B: mhm 

153.06 157.24 B: ah well [mn] i'm i have some relatives in israel 

157.20 159.88 A: oh really oh i see mhm 

157.33 158.17 B: so it's 

158.31 159.10 B: it's 

159.26 173.83 B: a very you know it's a very precarious situation and actually um i have wanted to go to israel for some time but ever since i've been old enough that i would make the decision to travel there it just it's been so um 

174.11 188.82 B: such a frightening place to go that i haven't had the chance to go and visit relatives and it's it's very distressing in a way because you know when they talk about when they talk about peace it just doesn't seem like anybody truly wants peace 

188.64 191.93 A: (( mhm mhm [noise] [noise] oh yeah mhm )) 

188.86 190.13 B: that they just want 

190.15 194.51 B: they just want to destroy each other and annihilate each other and 

194.88 199.66 B: um i mean i have a a very dear friend who's in the the army in israel 

199.67 202.78 B: and she says that um 

199.71 200.64 A: uh-huh 

202.77 212.94 B: that the goal is t- to is not to negotiate anything at this point not to settle anything not to you know give up land or make some kind of arrangement but rather 

212.77 225.54 B: to simply for every um every person killed in israel to retaliate and kill another person another palestinian and it's it's this mentality of you know back and forth that it just 

223.98 225.49 A: mhm mhm 

225.46 236.65 B: it's just very scary and the more i read about it it it just today's today's news about the middle east is reminiscent of last year's news which is reminiscent of the year bef- i mean it just seems like nothing is ever really changing right 

237.27 247.96 A: yeah you are right you are right um i do understand that i mean in turkey we are a little bit far away um from the war even though we are close to these countries 

247.78 248.59 B: (( yes mhm )) 

247.97 249.01 A: um 

249.19 261.31 A: a- but i can understand you i'm ah i'm i'm in the in the place of we're a little bit like i'm looking to all that you want from the theoretical perspective rather than like a- the real situation 

256.28 257.23 B: mhm 

261.18 262.13 B: mhm 

261.51 267.19 A: i mean like for instance in your case if you want to travel to israel and um 

267.51 277.16 A: like this affects you i mean directly rather than my situation here so i mean i can understand your concern really um 

277.09 290.87 B: now tur- turkey has played a role in in in what's going on with iraq now right in terms of um being a base for inte- they've been very um they've been allies with the united states in offering them 

283.61 284.51 A: (( yes mhm )) 

291.17 294.09 B: ah space an- and help like that right 

293.35 298.38 A: mhm yes yes they were um first they said i i guess 

298.52 310.26 A: i mean they were into especially the government our new government they were into opening the bases on northern iraq but later on somehow they couldn't pass the um 

306.29 307.18 B: mhm 

312.44 325.15 A: what what is called i don't know but i mean the senate i- they do not pa- ah let the american troops to use the turkish ah land on northern iraq and this was kind of like an u- unexpected result 

320.30 321.23 B: right 

325.19 331.20 A: and the government was so upset but on the other hand um the majority of the people 

331.02 345.32 A: living in turkey like at that point they were against any kind of war um toward any country so somehow it represented the ah the voices of people living in the country by like rejecting um 

343.09 343.87 B: (( mm )) 

346.20 347.06 A: i mean 

347.42 349.61 A: the u._s. troops to use the 

349.70 352.00 A: lands of turkey in the war 

351.90 352.78 B: mhm 

352.13 365.94 A: but ah somehow that government was trying to argue with the ah people and they couldn't manage it but ah of course i mean later on they said oh we are in the coalition too and um turkey let the u._s._a. 

366.24 368.49 A: airbases to use the 

368.69 370.19 A: the airspace 

370.12 383.86 B: there must be just so much pressure on these countries from because of france and germany being you know so polarized from the united states efforts there just there just much be so much pressure within europe itself 

378.37 381.54 A: yeah yeah mhm yeah i know 

384.17 388.11 A: [lipsmack] yeah the pressure is always there though in any way ah [laughter] i mean 

388.95 393.02 A: and i guess in terms of like france and germany 

392.99 405.11 A: i guess they were they like [mn] aga- they were kind of against the war because they recognized that they were not going to gain anything like they thought they will be excluded from what is going on 

400.64 401.68 B: right 

405.06 409.35 A: and of course from their perspective it was kind of weird what they thought 

409.43 412.46 A: and i guess this is why they forced um 

412.59 419.78 A: like they forced this perspective being against the war because they changed their minds right now as i know 

416.17 417.21 B: how do you 

418.72 420.24 B: yeah 

420.47 421.48 B: how do you 

420.62 422.64 A: it is kind of weird [laughter] 

422.43 426.46 B: how do how do you personally feel about the war i'm always curious to hear 

426.49 428.42 B: how other people feel about it 

426.90 428.81 A: well in fact 

428.99 434.40 A: we were all against saddam in any kind of regime like that that is going on 

434.17 435.07 B: mhm 

434.38 447.31 A: so in some manner ah right now i feel a little bit comfortable with the situation because the war is ended and somehow i guess i mean i'm hoping that the people are not dying after all and um 

448.24 459.63 A: [mn] well this is kind of a like a good um improvement but on the other hand i mean i i it's kind of obvious that um even though u._s._a. 

459.72 473.92 A: pretends that they want the peace for everyone i think basically everything is um related to money and ah the oil in middle east i mean even like [mn] i don't know this is kind of really too obvious 

467.41 470.06 B: oh absolutely yeah 

474.18 475.79 B: yeah no it's it's 

475.84 481.76 B: it's funny that you say that because it it seems like there's always economic self interest involved wherever 

481.78 484.43 B: we you know we go to ah 

485.85 496.63 B: to s- start something so to speak but it just i mean i personally i've reversed myself i was very opposed to the idea of going to war because i thought it would be so divisive among 

496.77 504.37 B: so many countries that it would begin just a sea of retaliation against the united states for getting involved where um 

504.73 519.48 B: you know basically just to protect their own economic interests and not understanding the way of life in other countries and trying to impose american values upon countries that maybe were not um amenable to it 

519.47 521.04 B: [mn] however now 

520.87 521.85 B: seeing 

521.69 524.67 B: just the the c._n._n. reports on how 

524.51 537.41 B: how the pe- so many of the people in iraq now i don't know if it's if it's you know bias like you were saying with the media to present it to americans in a certain way because i wouldn't put it past the media but it does seem like there 

537.34 539.81 B: is a significant amount of the population 

537.49 542.10 A: (( mhm )) 

539.88 546.72 B: is glad that that this is happening that their government is you know that saddam is coming you know is is out of power 

546.52 550.69 A: mhm mhm yeah yeah 

549.46 550.35 B: um 

550.55 551.55 B: [lipsmack] i mean it's 

551.61 559.09 B: it just it it's amazing to me that we haven't seen more of a fight from and i mean the whole suggestion that 

559.37 569.48 B: we killed saddam it it seems kind of it seems viable in a way because we haven't seen any kind of hostile retaliation against us i mean thank god but i was 

567.47 571.72 A: mhm 

569.62 571.61 B: expecting more of a ah 

571.80 573.42 B: of some type of fight 

575.10 576.27 A: yes yes 

576.38 578.49 A: i agree to that 

576.60 577.63 B: and 

577.64 578.67 B: and i mean 

578.83 588.16 B: i- i'm not a i don't know if you're a big george w. fan or not i'm not particularly and i i thought that he was trying to use the opportunity to go to war like 

588.28 592.77 B: you know to get the approval ratings like his father got after the persian gulf war 

593.11 594.92 A: mhm mhm 

594.80 597.23 B: how do you feel about president bush 

597.46 599.82 A: president bush um
