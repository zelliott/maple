34.33 37.40 B: what they want us to discuss because it's a pretty big topic 

36.90 41.21 A: yeah it's a very serious topic i guess i think

53.29 56.82 B: um it's actually something i'm having a lot of trouble with

57.27 60.26 B: trying to sort it all out um 

58.98 59.70 A: (( ahah )) 

60.92 65.36 B: i wish i were a lot more familiar with the history of the region than i am 

65.06 66.10 A: mhm 

65.96 67.96 B: basically i think 

69.84 70.96 B: um 

75.82 78.99 B: i haven't always been entirely uh 

80.88 83.24 B: i haven't always been entirely confident 

84.17 86.70 B: in our decisions as far as uh 

87.37 91.55 B: supporting israel goes and and how that supports the peace process 

88.50 89.47 A: right 

91.11 92.61 A: right right 

91.69 93.94 B: and i can understand why 

95.44 96.47 B: um 

99.54 102.59 B: i think i think there definitely are some legitimate 

102.99 104.27 B: grievances 

103.86 105.79 A: mhm mhm 

105.18 106.77 B: ah coming from over there 

106.51 107.51 A: yeah 

107.17 110.00 B: but at the same time there's a very 

111.03 112.02 B: um 

113.26 115.96 B: there's a very obviously a very fanatical 

116.03 117.68 B: um intolerant 

117.65 118.65 A: mhm 

118.32 119.24 B: (( uh )) 

120.81 124.20 B: fact- you know to say the least faction within the uh 

124.57 128.17 B: muslim world a legitimate threat that we have uh to 

128.54 130.80 B: protect ourselves against because 

131.13 131.87 A: mhm 

131.25 132.25 B: um 

133.25 136.14 B: they're not they're not going to stop until 

136.54 139.81 B: and i'm i'm talking about for instance uh 

140.71 142.89 B: groups like hamas uh 

142.68 143.94 A: mhm 

143.27 147.95 B: hezbollah uh al qaeda whatever they're not going to stop until 

148.08 151.16 B: they're going to keep fighting they are not going to stop until either 

152.29 155.03 B: they're dead or they've inflicted 

155.24 157.74 B: lots of damage over there that's just the 

158.12 158.94 B: and that's 

159.05 159.90 B: that 

160.11 162.77 B: climate is constantly supported by the uh 

163.25 165.24 B: the culture of uh 

165.32 167.07 B: death over there within 

166.39 167.71 A: mhm 

168.05 170.38 B: islamic fundamentalism as far as 

170.40 174.74 B: um promises of martyrdom uh 

175.12 177.62 B: children basic- basically being raised 

177.73 181.36 B: with the expect- with the um expectation that they will 

177.75 178.75 A: right 

181.20 182.14 A: yeah 

181.50 183.90 B: go out and and and 

182.44 183.44 A: mhm 

184.45 185.92 B: and die by 

185.95 187.97 B: killing themselves and meanwhile 

188.03 188.74 A: yeah 

188.08 194.17 B: uh killing lots of other people whether whether they be israelis or or americans or whatever 

191.69 192.54 A: yeah 

194.29 204.03 A: right i think there's so much hatred in that area um i'm not sure that uh all countries should support israel completely because 

204.54 205.68 A: i think 

205.89 208.64 A: things tha- that land is 

209.24 215.90 A: not com- i mean maybe in history that belonged to israel but that 

216.91 217.80 A: i mean 

217.90 224.33 A: those people have been living there for so long and if you just by law or by rule you just 

225.14 226.54 A: get them out 

226.69 227.89 A: how can you 

228.12 229.45 A: say it's 

229.49 231.66 A: fair or something like that 

231.13 233.90 B: (( yeah act- [mn] because i um )) 

234.30 236.43 B: i was reading something about the uh 

236.56 239.20 B: thi- this was actually a program i was watching on t._v. 

238.76 239.91 A: mhm 

239.25 240.60 B: where the um 

241.06 246.62 B: the attitude of prominent zionists were was that well the arabs they have 

247.12 253.56 B: if you look at the entire region they have all this land we just we just want this little area 

249.59 250.68 A: mhm 

253.73 254.70 A: mhm 

253.89 255.39 B: which is kind of 

255.98 257.64 B: it's been buttressed by 

257.73 262.56 B: american foreign policy as well but that doesn't change the fact that 

259.57 260.34 A: (( yeah )) 

263.06 267.29 B: people are living there and they're getting they're getting uprooted they're getting 

264.29 265.17 A: yeah 

267.45 271.84 B: pushed out of their homes the ones that the ones that are still there they're having 

268.70 269.85 A: yeah 

272.03 274.78 B: uh their own land flooded with uh 

274.96 278.35 B: with settlers from all over the world who happen to 

277.45 278.23 A: yeah 

278.52 279.46 B: um 

279.51 280.28 A: right 

279.52 282.06 B: claim the same um 

282.81 285.09 B: for our purposes religious identity 

284.57 294.11 A: right just imagine that for example if a part of a part of the united states like new york um it belongs to some 

285.16 286.15 B: and 

294.25 307.49 A: people in the ancient times and now they want to come back were america just to say yeah you can come back i will give you this land i think it would be so hard to make this decision i mean 

301.95 302.56 B: mm 

306.99 307.65 B: mm 

307.67 311.58 A: um so i think uh-hum the problem is 

311.86 312.88 A: if you 

313.42 314.50 A: fight 

315.44 317.42 A: with your enemy 

317.82 323.06 A: you're going to die too your enemy is going to die and you're going to die too you just 

321.51 323.29 B: mm 

323.35 325.02 A: should get ready to 

325.68 331.99 A: to dig out two graves for both you and your enemy i think the thing is to 

328.12 328.91 B: yeah 

332.24 336.22 A: find some peace in that area not by 

336.21 338.14 A: armed forces but 

338.06 340.94 A: try to think of some other ways to 

340.80 353.25 A: get it done because if you use armed forces there is no way that there's going to be peace there maybe by force temporarily for ten years or at most for ten twenty years or thirty years 

353.04 356.21 A: but the problem is still there 

357.14 361.07 B: yeah and that's and the unfortunate thing is bec- because 

361.48 365.26 B: obviously any- anyone of good faith will realise that uh there's 

365.39 369.24 B: you know there's there's good people and there's there's bad people on either side of the 

369.50 370.46 B: um 

372.27 375.30 B: on either side and that there there there are 

373.43 374.55 A: mhm 

376.08 377.92 B: there are people in the 

378.27 380.91 B: there i mean there are factions in the arab world 

380.98 382.84 B: [mn] progressive factions who 

382.97 385.19 B: really want a a peaceful 

385.20 388.81 B: solution as as there are factions in the israeli 

386.07 386.67 A: (( mm )) 

387.55 388.33 A: yeah 

388.49 389.48 A: mhm 

388.84 389.79 B: um 

390.80 393.51 B: coming from the israeli community but 

393.11 394.07 A: mhm 

393.70 395.49 B: i think those voices are 

395.78 398.32 B: not only being drowned out but i think 

399.06 402.74 B: ignored as far as um mainstream media 

402.58 403.53 A: yeah 

403.25 404.91 B: coverage goes i 

404.27 405.30 A: mhm 

405.08 407.16 B: mean because there there 

408.28 409.29 B: (( i mean there )) 

410.08 412.04 B: there are israelis that are 

412.22 414.08 B: and a lot of um 

414.65 417.53 B: a lot of american jews as well who are obviously 

417.23 418.04 A: yeah 

417.69 420.42 B: very critical of um 

421.48 424.61 B: of israel's territorial expansion in fact 

423.97 425.03 A: mhm 

424.65 427.23 B: historically some of the most um 

427.60 430.75 B: outspoken opponents of zionism were 

430.47 431.68 A: mhm 

431.06 432.01 B: um 

432.11 433.74 B: were jews themselves 

433.44 434.92 A: yeah yeah 

435.36 436.40 B: but um 

435.54 436.24 A: yeah 

436.50 438.68 A: right [sigh] i know it 

438.10 443.85 B: and i i i'm i'm i'm sorry i know i'm probably going off on a bunch of tangents here it's a it's a very large 

444.05 445.22 B: um 

445.77 448.90 B: topic with a lot of areas to um 

447.17 451.79 A: it's it's too large [sigh] i don't think we can finish in ten minutes but 

448.95 449.98 B: yeah it is [mn] 

452.03 454.18 A: anyway i just wish that 

454.97 456.01 A: um 

456.27 457.34 A: there 

458.79 459.78 A: (( there's a )) 

460.20 461.76 A: better choice than 

464.12 465.18 A: using 

466.04 467.15 A: weapons 

467.99 469.56 A: but i know it's 

469.68 471.88 A: almost impossible at this time 

470.57 471.34 B: yeah 

471.82 474.55 B: yeah i wish there were too it's just i i don't see it 

474.09 475.03 A: yeah 

474.91 476.36 B: i don't see it happening 

475.97 477.05 A: mhm 

478.92 479.97 A: and i hope 

480.13 482.82 A: united states is not becoming another israel 

484.92 485.82 B: i'm sorry 

486.25 490.35 A: i'm just hoping u- united states is not becoming another israel 

486.52 487.29 B: (( say again )) 

490.36 493.26 A: um because of the terrorist attacks or 

493.97 495.57 B: i i sure hope not 

494.42 498.48 A: i hope i hope i hope our country will adopt more 

498.71 506.05 A: peaceful policies with other countries and even though we don't agree with their policies we 

506.28 507.71 A: try not to 

507.84 508.77 A: um 

509.23 511.87 A: disagree too much because 

513.34 515.16 A: that will 

515.24 517.67 A: in some way damage our own 

517.88 519.19 A: (( land )) 

521.01 522.28 A: eventually 

521.25 524.59 B: yeah i mean it's it's it's another thing to uh 

524.02 524.96 A: yeah 

525.47 527.85 B: to keep in mind our or what our 

527.33 528.29 A: right 

528.00 534.68 B: as far as the as far as our current administration goes what are our our true motives over there i want to 

532.80 533.95 A: yeah 

537.32 538.32 B: um 

540.71 542.82 B: i like to think it's a lot more 

543.48 544.99 B: reasonable than 

545.78 550.00 B: [mn] criticisms from the far left that say oh it's um 

550.42 555.42 B: oh it's just just for oil and i [mn] i'd like to think it's a lot more 

555.61 557.49 B: um complex than that 

557.17 559.27 A: yeah yeah i agree 

557.60 558.38 B: but 

559.79 561.64 B: honestly i don't 

562.06 563.68 B: i don't trust the uh 

564.60 566.19 B: president bush i 

566.43 568.26 B: seriously doubt his uh 

568.79 572.65 B: his motives there like [mn] i think as far as far as 

572.98 577.72 B: and now we're kind of spilling over into uh iraq but as far as uh 

578.70 580.51 B: our agenda there it seems like 

580.62 583.99 B: freeing uh the iraqi people from 

584.15 587.64 B: you you know saddam hussein's tyranny was really kind of a footnote 

585.47 586.34 A: mhm 

587.50 588.53 A: mhm 

587.77 591.23 B: as far as why we're going over there first it was 

590.13 590.85 A: (( ahah )) 

590.92 591.90 A: mhm 

591.69 592.76 B: um 

593.90 596.84 B: first it was the weapons of mass destruction which 

597.50 599.89 B: uh whether he does whether he does have them or not
