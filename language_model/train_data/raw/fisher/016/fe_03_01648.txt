0.00 1.77 B: hi my name is samantha 

1.62 3.21 A: hi i'm jennifer 

2.89 4.36 B: hi jennifer 

6.22 9.70 A: so the topic is um the middle east 

9.23 10.46 B: right 

10.63 20.70 B: i really feel that going in there right now was a wise idea but staying there throughout the peace process 

20.82 23.11 B: is really out of the question 

23.65 29.66 B: um a lot of our soldiers have been over there so long already 

29.94 36.37 B: some have been stationed over there for up to six months and i think it's time for them to come home 

37.88 44.81 A: i don't have too much of a an opinion on it um i do agree that we should have had the war i was all for it 

44.29 45.47 B: right 

45.12 46.18 A: um 

46.22 50.52 A: i don't i don't really know what to say on this topic i'm kind of you know 

50.63 53.81 A: i really don't know what i think about it fully you know 

53.80 62.55 B: yeah well being a military girlfriend it's kind of one of these things where i'm ready for him to come home 

63.02 66.15 A: you have somebody a family member back there 

63.02 63.95 B: and 

65.88 67.13 B: yeah 

66.77 68.07 A: oh wow 

67.86 74.69 B: and knowing that they could have to stay there through a peace process 

75.13 77.41 B: just doesn't seem fair 

77.23 78.57 A: it doesn't 

77.86 80.43 B: it's time for them to come home 

80.64 86.35 B: as soon as the war is over i don't think we should have to stay there and become diplomats 

86.76 90.14 B: because of the fact that we wanted the war 

90.91 104.77 B: britain wanted the war but they're ready to pull out and i see no reason for us to stay there and try to sort out their issues we went there to do what we said we were gonna do so and then come back 

105.41 108.64 A: um i was under the impression that the war was over am i wrong 

109.16 111.20 B: no not really 

109.41 110.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

110.58 111.94 A: it's not over 

111.49 114.33 B: its semi over 

114.63 118.64 B: in some areas but there's still some active fighting 

118.85 121.44 B: the biggest part of the war is over 

122.03 123.81 B: but as for 

123.96 126.97 B: i know they sent two carrier ships home 

127.71 129.35 B: (( but there are still )) 

129.47 133.64 B: tonnes of soldiers over there and there are active street fights 

134.21 136.16 B: just i guess from 

136.85 139.37 B: protesters or pro 

139.98 143.22 B: saddam pro iraqi kind of people 

143.38 145.25 B: that are still out there 

145.55 153.80 A: um i have um a question i don't know if it's off topic but how well were you able to stay in contact with um your family members that are over there 

153.04 153.98 B: (( none )) 

153.87 154.84 A: none 

154.44 155.47 B: (( none )) 

155.46 157.50 A: are you serious wow 

155.52 156.59 B: um 

158.25 160.81 B: [noise] my boyfriend left 

161.75 163.08 B: let's see 

164.29 166.01 B: a month ago 

166.20 168.90 B: and i have not talked to him one time since 

168.91 170.59 A: (( [noise] really )) 

170.47 173.91 B: and the worse part is tomorrow is his birthday so 

174.41 176.86 B: it's gonna be a long day 

174.53 176.13 A: that's hard 

177.61 179.86 B: but we have friends there 

180.14 183.36 B: and we are very supportive of them 

183.75 187.47 B: and knowing that they could have to stay and sort out 

187.58 194.34 B: problems that they did not cause or stay over there and try and form a new government just doesn't seem right 

194.46 196.39 A: yeah 

195.02 198.64 B: i say they need elections just as we have 

199.02 200.47 B: pick people 

200.77 203.98 B: fairly and then call it a day 

204.38 206.74 B: because it's just been too much 

206.88 211.17 A: so why are they still over there i don't i mean 

210.40 215.82 B: for a start the peace keeping deal from what i understand 

216.52 218.62 B: a lot 

218.68 227.07 B: with them having active street fights and things like that they're staying there almost as armored guards to protect 

227.15 230.13 B: i guess just normal civilization 

231.84 234.93 A: so has ah nobody been able to come back yet 

235.02 237.89 B: two carrier ships were sent home 

238.10 241.75 B: i guess it's been about a week and a half ago 

242.26 244.39 B: and that's it 

244.30 245.60 A: (( [noise] wow )) 

244.64 249.71 B: and they have been out there the longest so yeah it was time for them to come home 

250.14 254.22 B: but all of the new people that were just sent or 

254.27 256.76 B: otherwise are still there 

257.66 268.04 A: wow you don't hear a lot of this on the news i mean i watch the news quite frequently but i mean um i live in oregon and um the news here is it all pretty much says that the war is over 

268.21 279.62 B: well i am in virginia and we are surrounded by a lot of military installations and of course being not that far from washington we get a lot of their news 

268.32 269.26 A: i mean 

280.05 282.10 B: so i guess we would hear 

282.14 283.85 B: a little more 

283.89 287.41 B: but i'm not sure how much i rely on the internet a lot 

287.91 292.48 B: to kind of sort things out and figure out what's going on 

293.16 297.80 A: when should you get word that um you know they might be sending people back 

298.33 299.92 B: it's hard to say 

300.35 306.20 B: i'm just one of these people that when he knocks on the door then he's home 

306.68 308.41 B: because i really don't 

308.70 311.13 B: expect to hear anything else 

311.87 317.27 A: that's really tough i mean you can send things over there right but can they not respond or 

317.22 319.54 B: i haven't even sent anything 

319.57 321.01 B: because 

321.10 323.42 B: he was stationed away from here 

323.67 330.57 B: actually in kentucky and he had a friend tell me that he was leaving 

330.92 336.31 B: it was just one of these things he did not feel like he could say his goodbyes 

337.05 338.42 B: properly 

338.64 339.75 B: so 

339.89 345.64 B: i found out two days after he left and as for any contact it has been nothing 

347.04 348.10 A: wow 

347.77 355.58 B: and we went through an adopt a soldier program and we actually got this guy that drives a tank 

355.81 358.88 B: and i guess we wrote to him 

359.69 366.38 B: three weeks ago and we still haven't heard anything back so i'm thinking that contact is little to none 

368.66 371.19 B: but it's really hard for the families 

371.45 374.59 A: this has gone on a lot longer than i thought it would 

374.15 375.50 B: oh me too 

376.01 379.38 B: but i think it should have been finished the first time 

379.56 380.93 A: oh yeah 

380.32 386.14 B: they went over there and just kind of said oh we're done when they were nowhere near 

387.37 388.65 B: so i can't 

389.10 391.48 B: foresee having to go back 

391.81 395.88 B: five years from now ten years from now to do this all over again 

398.25 399.17 A: wow 

400.35 407.80 B: but it has been an interesting war having a lot of the news media people over there right in the middle 

408.81 412.07 B: which sometimes is fair and sometimes it's not 

412.10 413.32 A: yeah 

412.56 418.30 B: but we've seen firsthand exactly what's going on where we didn't have that with desert storm 

418.45 419.78 B: we know 

422.65 436.27 A: yeah i know some people in the military but i used to live in california and um i moved to oregon so i lost contact with them all but i know a lot that was my main group of friends so i'm sure they're all back there and i don't know anything about what's going on with any of them 

426.15 427.10 B: (( ahah )) 

435.79 438.50 B: yeah that 

437.46 442.67 A: i don't know what ships are over there they were in the navy so i don't know what ships are over there or anything 

443.54 445.89 B: i have tried to keep up 

445.99 449.05 B: but a lot of the times i just give up 

449.70 455.17 B: it's one of these things where i don't want to know but i'm still curious 

455.37 456.70 B: so i look 

457.26 462.31 B: sort of frequently sometimes i wait a day or two before i look at any news 

463.05 464.03 A: do you think 

464.05 467.41 A: um they are like withholding any information from us 

467.50 470.94 A: you know maybe the president or the media and 

467.54 469.33 B: oh absolutely 

470.34 483.97 B: absolutely because i think that it's more than them just going over there doing peace keeping right now it's bound to be something more than that because i think they would have sent more than just two ships home 

471.34 472.44 A: really 

484.73 485.90 A: yeah 

486.41 488.56 B: so i really think they are 

489.75 495.36 B: they must be there's no way that they could go through all of this without having any secrets 

495.65 498.52 B: for just protection reasons 

501.58 504.53 A: um do you know if they ever did find saddam 

504.56 505.68 B: (( no no )) 

505.43 506.93 A: they did not find him 

505.94 507.34 B: they did not 

507.53 513.95 B: there's no hard core evidence to prove that he's alive or dead or anything 

514.55 519.28 B: it's just pretty much up in the air people have said he was wounded or 

519.67 524.03 B: someone had reported he was dead but that was never confirmed 

525.05 525.91 B: and they 

525.14 528.00 A: i i personally think he's still alive 

528.27 532.26 A: i mean it's hard to tell but it's just my own little theory i think he is 

531.69 540.81 B: oh i think he is too because they were talking about how he has underground living quarters and whatever else so he's bound to be 

541.51 547.03 B: they said he has living quarters that stretch out for miles underground 

547.31 549.10 B: so there's no way 

549.36 550.86 B: that he could have 

551.11 554.24 B: just magically disappeared 

553.61 558.45 A: yeah i mean there would have been a trace of him so i think he's alive 

558.54 565.85 B: and the videos that they show on t._v. i think were pre recorded i'm not too certain that they were right then 

565.82 570.31 A: yeah i heard about that from the beginning ever since the very beginning of the war 

570.93 578.16 A: because they said that he had doubles and then they got people in there to try and analyze it and maybe see if it was one of his doubles and 

578.57 580.59 A: it's pretty complicated 

579.92 581.15 B: yeah 

581.56 587.42 B: and tough for the media too because they are trying to report but yet not give away too much 

587.10 588.53 A: yeah 

587.79 593.57 B: because i know they sent several reporters out for giving away information [laughter] 

592.91 594.28 A: yeah geraldo 

593.91 598.43 B: yeah i don't know why he was there to begin with but okay 

594.43 595.89 A: [laughter] 

598.87 599.95 B: and then that other
