12.61 14.97 A: th- what's going on with the war and everything 

14.76 18.27 B: i guess o- or all the things in the middle east [laughter] [sigh] [noise] 

17.30 21.29 A: [laughter] so what do you think about happened over there 

21.55 25.65 B: well i think it's a great thing to get him out of power 

25.83 30.36 B: you know because he is nothing but [mn] evil [laughter] 

29.76 34.03 A: oh for sure gosh isn't it amazing how fast it happened 

33.70 38.69 B: [mn] yeah i- i'd like to know for sure that they got him [mn] 

37.88 43.89 A: oh for sure for sure 'cause that's the still the question it seems like h- apparently he keeps popping up everywhere 

43.45 46.55 B: (( [noise] right or we'll relive what we went through )) 

46.57 48.20 B: [mn] with the gulf war 

48.19 50.06 A: right exactly [mn] 

49.75 57.46 B: he could still come back if all of his you know sons and [noise] everything are still there some of 'em or what not he could still take power over again 

51.56 52.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

57.11 66.53 A: [noise] right exactly well he could intimidate the people the way he did last time and scare them and get them all [noise] [mn] thinking that this is you know that he's going to take over again and scare them 

66.40 67.32 B: (( yeah )) 

66.67 73.30 A: [noise] so it's a kind of a frightening situation when you really think about it [noise] 

71.40 72.89 B: yes [noise] 

73.15 76.76 B: true and [mn] you know [noise] he'd use any means necessary 

76.76 91.76 A: exactly it's just i remember when they first sa- said they bombed him you know 'cause i w- i was at a friend's house and i was house sitting and i got up and i turned on the t._v. and it said we'd just bombed [noise] hit wherever he's at or whatever i was so surprised 

91.46 99.09 B: yeah me too when i first when i seen it on the news w- well i think a lot of people were the the the troops didn't even know [laughter] it was going to happen so 

98.24 107.74 A: [laughter] i know it was so [noise] and of course my mind went immediately like how lucky could we get to get him on the first shot i mean really [noise] 

104.28 105.24 B: really 

105.75 106.80 B: yeah 

106.98 110.14 B: i was hoping that would have happened but [laughter] 

109.29 110.45 A: [laughter] 

110.91 112.01 A: (( [noise] )) 

111.31 118.34 B: it just i mean [mn] i i support our troops and president and everything he's doing but [sigh] i- 

118.39 122.66 B: like if they don't get him it's like [mn] useless to me in a way 

122.58 132.78 A: right exactly well of course they the people are apparently free i mean the- they're starting to feel free at least without that bondage of him being around so that's one good thing 

122.68 123.56 B: (( you know )) 

124.04 124.93 B: that 

129.64 130.55 B: (( yeah )) 

132.61 136.21 B: yeah well there's still if you see some of 'em arabs you say 

136.29 143.40 B: how's it feel to be free or you think [mn] they won't comment 'cause they're still scared so he may be somewhere [laughter] 

139.98 140.98 A: right 

142.79 151.44 A: [laughter] well you can just imagine i mean and every once and a while he probably [noise] pops out on one of their iraqi t._v. stations and saying i'm still here whether he really is or not 

151.17 152.12 B: right 

153.03 158.33 A: [noise] i just can't imagine living like that myself course we live in the united states how could we imagine 

157.88 159.96 B: (( [mn] really that's true )) 

160.19 162.88 B: w- we've got every freedom there is but 

162.44 170.00 A: [noise] exactly [noise] well what do you think about these people that were protesting the war do you think that that was a bunch of nonsense [noise] or do you think they should have just [mn] 

170.19 171.79 A: took it and shut up 

172.14 173.12 B: well 

173.46 180.73 B: honestly i think they should just shut up but [laughter] you know like that's their right i mean that's one of the freedoms we have over here so 

175.44 176.89 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

180.56 182.10 A: yeah exactly 

182.27 183.75 A: well we had 'em here in 

182.63 186.02 B: i don't want war no more 'n anybody else but 

184.89 193.85 A: [mn] well exactly i mean my son could be c- i mean if they if this had gone on and there was a draft my son could have been called up 'cause he's only twenty he could have been drafted 

191.77 192.76 B: yeah 

193.55 194.47 B: right 

194.40 202.78 A: and so it's it really scared me to think that he might be drafted into something [noise] that i necessarily wouldn't want to happen but by the same token i wouldn't want him not go 

202.80 207.55 A: defend our country whatever way the president said that that's what he wanted [noise] 

207.12 209.83 B: (( [mn] right yeah y- yeah my )) 

210.22 215.01 B: i had family serve and everything and like i said i support 'em 

215.05 223.28 B: a hundred percent i you can't just support 'em ten percent and say well that's okay and you know agree with some things you have to go all the way [laughter] i 

221.77 223.87 A: [noise] right exactly 

223.82 236.55 B: mean not to say that that's their right and everything but if they're going i think people if they're going to live in the united states they need to stand behind it it's just you know they got a choice they don't have to live here either [laughter] 

235.75 241.72 A: exactly that's true i mean they can go some place and see what's it really like to be oppressed and to be afraid 

241.12 242.12 B: right 

242.12 249.85 A: you know and wasn't it exciting about the way they got um that that p._f._c. lynch out [noise] i mean was that just a miracle or what 

249.60 254.33 B: oh i think it was a miracle we had said prayers for all of 'em and 

251.75 252.82 A: gosh 

253.76 255.32 A: oh definitely 

255.75 258.83 A: [noise] that was just i mean that was incredible 

256.42 258.33 B: (( i'm surprised he got home )) 

258.66 263.59 B: yeah i've seen some videos the day of the other seven getting home and that was good 

263.29 270.22 A: yeah that was really good i was glad they got that other girl it was too bad that one girl died though i hate it girls going to war personally 

269.94 277.32 B: [mn] yeah i do too but that's something that women have fought for t- they're just as good as a man so [laughter] 

276.41 278.08 A: right exactly 

277.54 280.57 B: if that's what they want to do more power to 'em i guess 

279.84 289.67 A: yeah l- like i'm glad i was never in a position [noise] to be young enough that if there was a draft and they started drafting girls that i'd be one of the ones to get drafted i never had any desire to go in the military 

287.28 288.55 B: yeah 

289.43 293.24 B: me neither [laughter] too much work for me [laughter] 

290.27 291.92 A: [laughter] 

292.11 297.06 A: [laughter] exactly golly [mn] well do you think we're going to have peace now 

297.56 299.87 B: [mn] i don't think it'll be quick 

299.93 307.69 B: i don't think 'cause palestine and all them are uprising you know against us th- they don't like it because 

306.68 308.96 A: (( [noise] yeah exactly [mn] )) 

308.50 313.21 B: you know he has power over them too whether they admit it or not but [laughter] 

310.90 312.18 A: (( right )) 

312.62 314.53 A: right exactly 

313.88 314.95 B: (( so [mn] )) 

314.99 316.44 B: i don't know i mean 

316.85 322.68 B: i don't know what your beliefs are but i go by bible too and i put that into perspective too 

321.39 332.14 A: [noise] [noise] oh totally i totally agree i i mean i totally see scripturally what's happening and what's going to happen now because this is it you know we're getting down to the last [mn] to the end 

327.12 327.83 B: (( and )) 

328.99 329.90 B: yeah 

332.18 332.96 B: yeah 

332.22 335.72 A: so we may never see peace again on [noise] on this side of heaven anyway 

333.83 334.76 B: that's 

335.77 336.72 B: true 

336.83 342.07 B: i know um the only thing is if we get in there and try to 

339.87 340.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

342.55 354.45 B: [sigh] break ah palestine and israel up that's you know i just hope we stand behind israel because that's what we're supposed to do i think but they've they've got to show some people [laughter] 

353.59 355.40 A: yeah exactly 

355.12 356.34 B: (( so but [noise] )) 

355.85 367.96 A: gosh i totally agree with you i'm just [noise] it's kind of scary to think you know fortunately we have a godly president and so it's going to work out [noise] well because he's made the decision that he's going to do what's right hopefully he won't be swayed 

361.48 362.44 B: yeah 

365.89 367.00 B: right 

367.81 369.26 B: that's true 

369.29 372.44 B: (( i i'm thinking abo- too what um we were talking )) 

373.07 380.16 B: korea and all that the uprising over there and keep putting it in the news with this and i'm like 

379.31 380.96 A: [noise] 

380.12 390.83 B: well i wish that we'd concentrate on our efforts over there first afghanistan and iraq and get them under control what we need to do and get them idiots out of there [laughter] 

390.28 392.17 A: [noise] right exactly 

391.45 393.91 B: before we move on to somebody else 

393.61 406.29 A: oh for sure 'cause i mean we've got to i heard that that retired general that's going in today for the administration he's [mn] you know he's going to be the administrator over there and it seems like he's got some good plans [mn] you know i don't know if you heard the news today but 

406.08 412.98 A: he's going to go in and restore the water and he was in a hospital already and so he really wants to turn things around 

412.69 416.67 B: yeah well i didn't see that i missed that 

413.70 414.96 A: so that was a good thing 

416.63 431.12 A: that was o- i was driving to work this morning and i heard it on the radio about [mn] b- [mn] whoever this guy is this retired general that's going to be the administrator over there until they can put somebody in 'cause that's going to be the key it's who are they go- how are they going to decide who they're going to put into office 

430.99 431.93 B: right 

431.04 436.20 A: to run it now that saddam is out that saddam can't come in and intimidate or assassinate 

435.62 444.70 B: right i mean the ones that were in there before he moved up the ladder took him at his word and what the first day he called them in and was talking to them and he took 'em all out and hung 'em 

444.42 446.64 A: [noise] yeah exactly 

445.13 446.13 B: you know 

446.35 448.63 B: (( and so i mean )) 

449.06 457.18 B: (( they it's what i it goes back to what i was saying they need to make sure they have him and all his little twelve down the line descendents i think [laughter] it )) 

454.08 454.80 A: (( [noise] )) 

456.60 460.00 A: [noise] yeah i think so too well and i also did hear 

458.14 458.94 B: (( would be )) 

459.52 460.25 B: (( too )) 

460.43 473.88 A: well i i'm i also heard today too that they got one of his son in laws or one of saddam hussein son in laws too today that they've arrested and i think he was like [mn] i don't know number forty or something on the top fifty five wanted list or something 

473.66 474.86 B: mhm 

474.24 480.16 A: so it seems like they're starting to you know pick 'em out and get 'em a little bit at a time 

480.28 487.64 B: right i the you know if it takes a while to do that i think that's what their goal needs to be just to make sure 

488.17 494.83 B: because if i think they rush and put somebody in power and start doing everything it could be a mistake if they do it too quickly 

494.46 496.33 A: [noise] oh yeah definitely 

495.40 499.15 B: that you know that aint for sure if they got everybody [laughter] 

498.84 507.61 A: yeah exactly well what did you think about all that looting i was surprised when they when they were let them loot the capital and stuff i wasn't expecting that [noise] 

507.26 509.27 B: oh i wasn't either but 

509.36 510.34 B: i mean 

510.95 521.81 B: once again i can't imagine being that suppressed not having water and watch him at his homes have all these fountains and everything and swimming pools going and not have anything 

522.19 529.50 B: you know [noise] and they think he's dead and they're going to rebuild and all this it may be their only chance to get anything [laughter] i don't know 

528.66 530.29 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

529.57 538.63 B: but i was surprised that [mn] i guess though we didn't have the manpower to sit there and keep that under control and fight too at the same time 

537.86 539.72 A: yeah probably not 

539.67 544.76 B: i don't know but [mn] it was shocking but still i can kind of see 

541.52 542.74 A: (( and maybe you shoul- )) 

545.09 551.39 B: if i don't know i think that i wouldn't react the same way if i'd been you know liberated and stuff [laughter] 

548.80 562.92 A: [laughter] oh exactly you know and th- i'm sure probably some of the soldiers were probably even thinking hey you know this is the government buildings why not that's what my friend said she said it's a government building why not you know he took it from them it's their stuff [laughter] 

556.35 557.48 B: (( yeah really yeah )) 

559.44 561.12 B: (( that could be [laughter] )) 

562.35 566.13 B: i mean they kept it from them for so long [laughter] 

566.24 566.84 B: (( ah )) 

566.32 567.81 A: [laughter] oh 

566.99 568.06 B: but like 

568.05 581.54 B: what was it that pr- that prison he has for boys and he goes to their family and if they won't turn 'em over at what is it like age twelve to fight in his army they refuse to go he throws in that prison to work for 

573.55 574.55 A: (( gosh [mn] )) 

580.82 582.42 A: oh gosh 

581.50 583.65 B: him did you see all that all those 

582.93 586.39 A: i didn't i s- is that the torture chamber that you're talking about 

586.17 590.26 B: it's ah well there's a building that he had over like 

590.70 599.90 B: so many thousand i think kids boys all boys and if they refused to fight in his army train for his army they to took 'em away from the parents and threw 'em in there
