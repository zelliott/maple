0.00 5.91 B: hi i'm sarah and i'm a nineteen year old college student and i just woke up 

5.33 10.05 A: [laughter] hi i'm jennifer i'm uh twenty six i'm a graduate student 

9.64 11.24 B: okay where do you go 

10.93 12.58 A: uh the university of michigan 

12.49 14.86 B: oh i'm up in michigan too 

14.21 16.49 A: oh yeah where where do you go 

15.03 16.00 B: yeah 

16.10 19.00 B: i go to oakland community college [laughter] 

18.09 19.82 A: oh how do you like that 

19.18 20.28 B: it's okay 

19.85 21.13 A: yeah 

20.57 28.25 B: it's mostly because i'm like really poor and yeah i'm probably going to transfer down to massachussetts next year 

24.61 25.44 A: well 

27.47 29.27 A: oh yeah 

28.48 30.34 B: yeah [sigh] but it's okay 

29.99 30.70 A: (( [laughter] )) 

31.02 34.00 B: but yeah so what do you think about 

34.24 35.33 B: are you 

35.47 40.56 B: for one thing or the other with the i'm gonna open my window hang on 

39.73 41.01 A: [laughter] okay 

41.72 43.99 B: okay but yeah 

42.31 45.95 A: well i mean personally i think that 

45.96 51.47 A: we can get peace in that area and i i think that the but the only way to do is to 

47.47 48.47 B: mhm 

51.60 53.88 A: make a palestinian state and 

54.34 59.97 A: really separate the groups who obviously can't get along when they're sharing space 

59.85 62.11 B: [cough] what do you mean i'm 

62.18 67.31 B: kind of caught up on this but not as much as i should what do you mean make a palestinian state 

67.06 79.28 A: um well just make take some of the land that's now israel and make it a separate nation just like we originally made israel by just taking some land and saying okay here's a country for you hm 

78.93 80.68 B: [noise] yeah that's true 

81.17 87.07 B: let's see what are my thoughts on [noise] it do you know what gee what a great topic 

86.45 88.06 A: [laughter] 

87.64 91.58 B: you know my friends and i always talk about it but i can't seem to 

91.85 93.73 B: hm let's see 

94.04 97.84 B: well i know that my friend is totally against the war 'cause he 

98.70 105.88 B: he's kind of like an extreme christian and thinks that you know we shouldn't interfere with that stuff and 

105.12 106.19 A: mhm 

106.09 116.94 B: and that's okay that he thinks that but i don't know i personally think that action does need to be taken to get done and although no one really likes war sometimes it's 

117.14 124.34 B: as cliche as this is sometimes it is necessary and i think in this case the risks outweighed the 

124.38 127.13 B: benefit of just staying uninvolved 

126.70 133.42 A: yeah and do y- would you feel that way even if it turns out like we don't find any weapons after we've been there for a while 

133.29 134.50 B: (( well )) 

136.26 139.66 B: let's see i don't know i think maybe that 

140.40 145.16 B: mm just the chance of there being weapons there would make it worth it i suppose 

144.55 145.85 A: yeah 

145.86 150.12 B: but he seems like a pretty dangerous guy anyways and 

150.17 155.40 B: i guess you know i can understand why bush would wanna go in and 

155.70 164.77 B: just i guess this is one of the motives he used because he s- he said several things why he wanted to go over there and pull him out of his regime or whatever 

164.30 165.27 A: right 

165.37 171.71 B: but he seemed like he was a pretty bad dude and did a lot of terrible things to his people and stuff 

171.45 172.97 A: yeah definitely 

172.69 181.10 B: [cough] and i i don't like that and i can see why he would wanna go over there and you know kind of interfere 'cause i guess it's a humane thing to do 

181.61 183.14 B: to help out but 

181.66 182.66 A: yeah 

183.63 184.65 B: (( i don't know )) 

184.51 189.97 A: well the thing that bothered me about it is i felt like that was just an excuse because there's you know 

188.28 189.30 B: yeah 

190.05 195.46 A: things going on all over the world all the time where people could use our help and where we could help 

195.58 203.54 A: without violence and by spending no money whatsoever or i mean not you know a lot less than we're spending on a war and remaking the country 

203.16 204.04 B: mhm 

203.37 215.23 A: you know like health crises in africa and all these kind of things so if he really just was saying hey i need to get rid of bad leaders and help people live better lives then this is not what he would've chosen 

214.99 215.93 B: yeah 

215.55 224.60 A: so i feel like he doesn't actually care about that he's just using that to kinda bring some more people on board who wouldn't have been on board otherwise 

224.13 234.14 B: yeah that's you know what that is a good thought that i haven't thought about that if one of his reasons for going over there is because they live a bad life and we wanna you know help make it better 

234.41 236.70 B: but i don't know how much 

237.26 249.02 B: a lot of people are using the the excuse that he wants the oil from that area but doesn't france get most of their oil from that area and we get most of it from canada so that's not really much of a factor 

241.69 242.89 A: mhm 

248.68 255.44 A: yeah i think that's true um i don't you know i don't really follow that aspect of it that much so i don't know 

251.78 252.34 B: (( [cough] )) 

255.32 256.17 B: okay 

255.58 268.34 A: all the facts behind that but but yeah so that might that seemed like it was a even a bigger argument when his father went that they so maybe like after that war we changed where we got most of our oil perhaps 

262.26 263.38 B: yeah 

267.83 268.90 B: mhm 

268.60 269.52 A: (( i don't know )) 

269.46 271.36 B: and what do you think about bush's 

271.38 273.51 B: he tried to kill my daddy 

273.17 276.00 A: [laughter] yeah that just doesn't 

276.69 282.19 B: i think that was a bad move uh like with public relationsly 

278.73 279.87 A: yeah 

282.26 285.79 A: definitely i mean you know he really like tries to be that kind of 

285.70 299.65 A: texas guy where like when we were looking for osama bin laden at first and he was saying you know there's this old poster in the west that says 'wanted dead or alive' that's not how presidents should talk i don't think i know he's from texas and that's how texans talk but that just seems to me 

289.33 289.95 B: (( [laughter] )) 

297.26 298.25 B: yeah 

299.51 303.33 A: now very presidential to say things like that 

302.60 303.55 B: i know 

303.57 314.57 B: i definitely should get with the big like diplomatic mess because i think just from what i know in the wake of trying to get the uh u._n. to come on with us to fight in iraq or 

312.55 314.07 A: (( right mhm )) 

314.36 319.46 B: you know to at least aggressively press saddam for whether or not he had weapons 

319.72 332.55 B: we kind of like insulted the u._n. by saying that we don't need their help and that even if they don't comply with us we're going to you know go against what they say and go into iraq and 

332.92 333.75 B: you know 

333.95 335.17 B: aggressively 

335.28 346.69 B: take action or whatever but like you know that kind of scared me because i don't know it's what's the u._n. for i mean it was created so we can have like a global 

336.52 337.59 A: right 

347.69 349.82 B: i don't know what i want to say here 

349.64 360.59 A: no i totally know what you mean if you know what's the point of having such an organisation if you're not going to abide by its wishes and agree with the group consensus about what's the right thing to do 

358.53 359.75 B: yeah 

360.48 367.79 B: yeah and i think it's good that we have you know a place where we can all send somebody and you know we can all talk about it 

367.70 368.81 A: right 

368.45 371.72 B: but i don't know i just we kind of 

371.77 378.50 B: didn't even think twice about it [cough] about just going against what they said or what they advised 

378.28 379.28 A: yeah 

379.23 381.67 B: but i don't know [laughter] 

381.40 384.90 A: and we've been doing that for a while like refusing to go with 

385.54 391.99 A: international rules about environmental standards and about getting rid of land mines like we wouldn't sign onto the anti landmine 

391.87 401.31 A: bill and you know all these kind of things that we're just kind of getting more and more estranged from the international community it's really kinda scary i think 

401.20 402.68 B: (( yeah that is true )) 

402.79 405.72 B: [cough] what other things about this were there 

405.73 406.52 B: hm 

406.91 410.45 B: you know what what's the what's the situation over there right now 

410.69 412.83 A: uh in iraq 

412.24 413.22 B: mhm 

412.79 423.72 A: um [mn] i well the person who's who bush chose to be the the civil commander until we get an actual iraqi government in place just arrived like yesterday 

421.46 422.30 B: mhm 

423.64 434.68 A: so i guess the first thing is he's gonna be he said he was trying to you know get the water and electricity back on and get food distributed was his first priority and and then move onto 

424.63 425.28 B: (( [cough] mhm )) 

435.21 442.12 A: uh you know more complicated things i guess in getting the government set up but he's already getting criticized for something or other 

439.18 440.09 B: yeah 

441.87 442.83 B: okay 

442.40 448.26 A: so uh oh one thing is that he just took so long to get there like why did he why wasn't he there weeks ago 

447.91 449.50 B: yeah that's true 

448.28 451.55 A: but [laughter] i guess he had other things to do i don't know 

451.32 452.49 B: mhm 

452.92 453.83 B: (( hm )) 

453.43 455.04 A: that's the last thing i heard 

455.29 460.67 B: [cough] well that's okay and they haven't found any like weapons of mass destruction or anything right 

460.23 467.85 A: no i mean they found like you know a few of those torture looking rooms but they haven't found anything any weapons as far as i've heard 

463.75 464.89 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

467.52 471.66 B: mhm [sigh] so i don't know was it worth it 

468.12 469.19 A: so 

471.74 477.41 B: if we don't find anything i guess it was good that we freed the people from his regime 

477.12 478.12 A: yeah 

477.80 483.67 B: but i don't know if we didn't satisfy the uh going in there to you know disarm him 

483.61 484.45 A: right 

484.01 487.99 B: and that means he wasn't breaking his side of the treaty then 

488.13 489.59 A: right 

489.05 490.88 B: (( i mean that's yeah )) 

491.02 503.55 B: if he had been i think that would be a good yeah this is one of my reasons for you know thinking that taking aggressive action against him was justified if he did break his end of the treaty i think that you know 

496.29 497.01 A: (( [sigh] )) 

503.72 510.49 B: he should pay for it you know just just like if we broke our end they'd probably make us pay i guess 

510.16 511.71 A: right definitely 

511.13 514.30 B: but i don't even know what our end of the deal was so 

513.79 527.80 A: i don't think we really had there was anything required of us like it's kind of like in japan after world war two you know they were defeated by us and so they just basically had to do whatever we said if we said get rid of your military they had to do it and we didn't have to do anything 

516.99 517.92 B: yeah 

525.78 527.22 B: yeah that's true 

527.49 528.79 B: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

528.17 530.67 A: but uh or like germany the same thing 

530.49 534.99 B: poor other countries have you ever been to another country 

532.74 533.90 A: yeah 

534.74 536.59 A: i haven't actually 

535.99 536.82 B: okay 

536.89 539.03 B: 'cause i've been to japan before 

538.59 539.64 A: (( oh yeah )) 

539.16 547.91 B: just for a like a summer as an exchange student but it's so cool and you know what i really wanna i think it would be really cool to get involved in uh 

548.82 552.53 B: just something that would allow me to travel to different places 

552.01 553.24 A: mhm 

552.54 555.47 B: and i'm thinking about going into politics but i don't know 

555.21 556.25 A: yeah 

556.22 562.28 B: and for saying that i really should be more like well buffed on the middle east situation but 

559.54 560.73 A: [laughter] 

562.65 564.33 B: i guess it just didn't 

564.34 566.00 B: click well [laughter] 

565.68 571.64 A: well you know i mean some some issues rile you up more than others and you pay attention to them better 

569.70 570.62 B: yeah 

571.57 574.41 B: [cough] [sigh] definitely 

574.29 576.29 A: well i actually just thought you know 

576.47 591.19 A: speaking about the weapons and whether or not we found any i thought something pretty scary and i don't think they have any evidence of this but it's just sort of the journalists speculating that with all the looting and everything it's possible that people 

579.36 580.25 B: mhm 

586.23 587.07 B: yeah 

591.11 599.89 A: took you know canisters of anthrax and all these kind of things and that they're now sort of distributed amongst the population and are actually more dangerous now because they can 

597.57 598.22 B: (( [sigh] ))
