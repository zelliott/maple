0.00 6.97 A: it's just something i do and i got to talk on the phone for like five ten minutes come on it's something that they pay you to do it's it's a national study a linguistic study i'm serious 

6.70 7.94 B: hi 

8.16 9.14 A: hello 

8.83 10.70 B: hi my name's michelle 

10.71 12.43 A: hi how are you my name's gill 

12.24 13.68 B: oh hi how are you 

13.53 21.32 A: all right you know we just have one little problem i didn't hear the subject because someone else kept trying to talk to me and i'm on a cell phone and i was just coming in the house 

21.20 25.34 B: oh it's about the middle east and what you think about what's going on over there 

24.98 27.13 A: (( oh okay all right fine )) 

25.71 26.68 B: and if you thi- 

26.74 31.29 B: and if you think there's going to be peace and should the u._s. stay involved 

31.15 32.05 A: (( ahah )) 

31.90 33.87 B: so how do you feel about it 

33.63 36.78 A: well do you want to start off and i will respond [noise] 

36.43 42.65 B: well i wish certainly would like to see peace over there but i'm not so sure it seems likes it's a pretty volatile area 

42.08 43.73 A: (( yeah yeah come on )) 

45.03 49.90 A: yeah yeah yeah it it really does um well personally the way that i see it 

50.18 53.69 A: well i i think i think it's materialistically driven the whole thing 

54.08 56.07 B: mhm yes i'm here 

54.35 55.24 A: hello 

55.82 61.22 A: oh and i don't think i'm being narrow minded about it i just think you know a lot of it has been driven by materialism 

61.43 63.70 B: materialism on whose part 

63.18 65.00 A: (( the united states )) 

65.27 66.98 B: (( mhm )) 

66.71 71.18 A: i mean there are people that are sincere in what they are doing but i think 

71.23 79.18 A: um i don't think it's really legit i think it is being driven by a lot of materialism as far as the oil that they want because you have other nations that are that are 

79.20 82.06 A: are just as so called evil and or wicked 

82.10 89.40 A: and that have a lot of arms that are not being documented properly and and they're not being gone after you know the same for going after these nations 

89.21 90.94 B: oh right 

90.90 91.67 A: (( you know )) 

91.46 94.96 B: yeah i don't know see i kind of struggle with it because um 

95.05 99.72 B: i know that they've made some kind of gruesome finds about what were being done to the people over there 

99.39 101.07 A: (( right [noise] )) 

100.10 105.82 B: and i think if ah that kind of stuff's going on and we don't do anything i mean i would hate to see another 

106.00 109.63 B: world war two type thing you know with the nazis and all that 

109.44 110.44 A: right 

110.01 112.89 B: because they found that warehouse with all those body parts in it 

112.72 114.29 A: right right 

113.71 115.76 B: and you think man if that's going on 

115.68 116.94 A: (( mhm )) 

116.50 118.40 B: then it's like you've got to do something 

120.50 124.30 A: well you know with me i have to be completely honest with you right 

123.63 124.91 B: yes 

124.28 139.10 A: i am african american so in my experience of the united states well i don't have to go into detail about that so i am a little questionable when any any government anyone in authority states their reasons for doing things because this country has a a history of oppression itself 

139.32 145.78 A: and it's being and it's always been done and still being done in such a subtle manner and don't get me wrong i'm not one of those bitter people and militant and you know 

145.80 154.17 A: and flag waving about it but at the same time i'm aware of it so it it appears to me that it's it's always something else it's not what the public is being told 

154.23 155.23 B: (( uh-huh oh )) 

156.58 158.13 A: there's always some some 

159.32 162.23 A: then you got the part that it still bothers me the fact 

163.22 165.52 A: (( it's like for what )) 

165.55 166.69 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

166.75 168.16 B: yeah 

167.60 170.36 A: and for me the the american public didn't want it 

171.23 180.54 A: we live in a constitution you know where it says that you know for the people by the people and the american public didn't want it and yet still they proceeded with it regardless of what the public said 

180.98 187.40 A: you know and and i i would say a good ten people i talk to black white whatever race they really they don't they oppose the war 

187.74 195.10 B: oh yeah i don't as as far as my friends go i don't think people oppose it but i don't think they were for it most of the people i know 

188.75 189.57 A: so 

194.28 197.14 A: right right right you're right you're right 

196.34 201.96 B: kind of middle of the road kind of well we don't really know enough to make a decision 

201.34 208.37 A: exactly exactly you're right maybe oppose is too strong a word but they're not really for it as of yet i agree with you 

208.31 209.35 B: oh right 

208.63 218.44 A: i agree with you because i don't like tyrants i mean even though the united states has has their has their you know their their you know has a lot of bad history but at the same time i wouldn't want to live in any other place 

218.72 228.59 A: you know they also have the the ah possibility to be a really great nation they always have because the structure is set up in that way it's just that you have so many screwed up people that take advantage of it you know 

222.47 223.35 B: right 

228.28 229.53 B: right 

228.91 230.16 A: and they pervert it 

230.27 233.42 A: so i agree with you whole heartedly on that subject i really do 

233.90 239.72 B: but it it's by the news it sounds like they don't want america to stay there to help them any more either 

239.78 243.39 B: that was the other question they asked do you think that america should stay and help 

244.11 245.52 A: i'm sorry what did you say 

245.27 251.91 B: the other question that they asked us was do we think that um the u- the u._s. should stay there and help 

251.56 253.16 A: should stay there and help 

252.59 253.96 B: yeah help them 

254.29 258.61 B: right now you know try to get peace and establish the government but it sounds like 

258.70 261.72 B: the sentiment in iraq is they don't want us there any more 

262.61 263.49 A: really 

263.29 269.54 B: yeah that's what i heard on the news today they're saying they want america to get out now and let them let them deal with it themselves but 

269.94 270.82 B: i don't know 

270.22 274.60 A: well in that well in that sense if if if the country itself 

274.26 275.45 B: yeah 

274.83 280.57 A: my feeling is if the country itself says they want america out and they want to deal with it themselves then that's what america should do 

280.74 281.91 B: yeah 

280.89 286.78 A: they should respect their sovereignty and government and let them deal with their own country as far as repairing it and putting it back together they have to do that 

287.01 288.18 A: (( that's what i feel )) 

288.25 300.09 A: i think america takes it upon itself to say that we as the peace keepers we spreading democracy across the world but i think that's somewhat arrogant in a way you know like i said we have our own problems and we have a lot of things that need to be done here 

300.09 310.83 A: so and it's not the point of not trying to help another nation but if the people themselves say that we want the responsibility of our own country then you are supposed to let 'em do that they are not children there are children there but you understand what i mean 

310.98 314.24 B: yeah i think so but i think they need to make sure that they kind of 

314.79 319.39 B: you know that there aren't any bad guys waiting around to take over and just kind of 

318.77 321.04 A: i agree i agree 

320.44 322.16 B: keep going with everything 

322.18 325.37 A: i agree let me ask you a question where does that end though 

325.61 326.85 B: when what 

326.53 329.96 A: where does that end as far as making sure there are not any bad guys 

330.26 331.99 A: (( taking over where does that end )) 

331.39 336.78 B: well i think they have to somehow get some kind of government at least set up and established 

336.80 338.42 B: some kind of authority 

338.59 345.03 B: um put something in place and then once whatever you know structure is in place i think they need to leave 

338.95 339.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

341.06 342.28 A: (( mhm )) 

345.41 348.49 A: right right once that structure gets into place 

348.09 349.83 B: yeah 

348.84 350.58 A: right right i agree 

350.03 354.08 B: and they have got some kind of system set up something you know it doesn't have to be 

354.11 358.12 B: modeled after us by any means but some kind of a system set up 

355.57 357.36 A: mhm 

357.92 359.24 A: yeah 

358.94 363.14 B: that you know they could um get them back on their feet 

363.96 364.88 A: (( ahah )) 

366.51 367.50 A: i agree 

368.50 369.30 B: so 

369.52 370.62 B: so anyway 

370.59 371.67 A: (( yeah )) 

371.17 374.26 B: it would be nice for it to be over and have everybody back home 

374.69 376.46 A: well that that will be a blessing 

376.58 382.46 A: you know i'm just i'm just now now the main thing is worrying about what do you think is going to happen afterwards as far as the united states 

382.63 386.29 A: people are worried about terrorism here increasing what do you think's gonna happen 

385.96 390.19 B: i don't know i i heard that they ah arrested somebody in detroit 

390.33 391.21 A: (( right )) 

390.34 391.72 B: i don't know um 

392.19 395.71 B: they had some explosives in the back of a car and they were looking at a bridge 

395.63 396.56 A: (( right )) 

396.62 398.34 B: and i think man i don't know 

400.23 402.49 B: i feel like it's never gonna be the same again 

402.57 403.33 A: no 

404.49 406.63 B: like there's always gonna be you know 

406.09 407.16 A: something 

406.76 411.06 B: suspicion and stuff going on in the background 

410.06 411.67 A: (( right right )) 

411.59 413.28 B: so where are you from 

413.48 416.53 A: me i'm originally from new york i live in philadelphia right now

433.19 435.39 B: (( oh i have i have never been there )) 

437.12 443.99 B: um i'm trying to think what the other questions were they asked it was all about the middle east stuff like if we ever think there will be peace 

440.88 442.56 A: right right right 

444.83 446.24 B: i think that was the other one 

445.19 446.09 A: (( what )) 

446.35 447.68 A: do you think 

447.70 452.46 B: i i don't know it's it's so volatile i think that um 

452.71 455.61 B: i'm not trying to put down islam but they just seem so 

455.97 457.88 A: volatile [laughter] 

457.06 461.20 B: yeah and mil- you know so militant in their views you know and 

460.59 461.91 A: right i agree 

461.67 462.66 B: and i think 

462.05 463.09 A: i agree 

462.88 468.45 B: i think it's gonna be hard when they always think they need to squash the enemy and 

464.65 465.63 A: i agree 

468.46 469.71 B: (( do you know what i )) 

468.57 470.67 A: mhm do you have religious beliefs 

470.43 471.25 B: what 

471.15 473.07 A: you do you have religious beliefs 

472.97 474.53 B: (( do i what )) 

473.84 475.85 A: do you have religious beliefs 

475.24 476.68 B: oh yes i do 

476.60 478.32 A: okay and you are 

477.89 479.13 B: (( i am a christian )) 

478.97 480.00 A: (( you are a christian )) 

480.02 487.03 A: well then then then i have i have i don't like to put certain titles on things because there's so many names and there's so many people that perverted the name 

487.39 494.56 A: but what i would like but what i feel about 'em is this i feel that that i do believe there is definitely a god there's a supreme being i think he has 

495.44 498.72 A: and above and beyond all i don't think we are supposed to destroy each other 

499.17 502.30 A: and history has shown that man can't do it on his own 

503.16 504.35 A: you know what i mean 

503.75 504.84 B: yeah i know 

504.64 509.84 A: history doesn't show that i mean over thousands of years he has never been able to do it on his own he cannot do it on his own 

509.94 515.95 A: man is imperfect he's gonna always do something wrong he's gonna get haughty he's gonna get proud he's gonna get arrogant 

515.93 521.91 A: you know and in these societies just like people argue about capital punishment and to me the strongest argument against it is 

521.89 525.58 A: (( the fact we have got a society that creates these monsters and then you want to kill them )) 

525.04 526.14 B: yeah 

525.53 537.62 A: i mean look at the average kid can turn on a video and see all the nakedness and sex and vulgarity that that he wants and this is what he every day so what type of mentality does it fuel you know what i mean 

537.20 538.17 B: i know 

538.51 539.63 B: oh i know 

539.02 540.30 A: (( you understand what i'm saying )) 

540.04 543.07 B: yeah we don't let our son play video games or watch t._v. 

542.88 551.32 A: yeah yeah i mean it's really bad i have an eighteen year old daughter and i talk to her often and i'm always telling her you know don't look like a hoochie you know 

550.90 552.26 B: (( oh yeah )) 

551.41 558.13 A: [laughter] or look like these girls these dress different be a lady and you will be surprised you're got a girl that someone is gonna want you're the one that someone's going to want to marry 

558.49 561.44 A: you know not the one that they just want to see for a few minutes you know 

561.14 562.92 B: yeah 

562.20 565.27 A: so it's just a whole um you know 

565.79 575.43 B: yeah it's really too bad but the impression i get of those people is it just seems that they are so tilted towards violence you know and they reward people for doing things 

566.24 567.27 A: (( i understand )) 

575.60 576.52 B: (( you know )) 

577.31 580.03 B: like did you hear about how saddam used to um 

580.11 582.09 B: pay off the families of the 

582.11 584.14 B: palestinian um 

584.25 586.24 B: suicide bombers 

587.40 588.55 A: i'm listening 

588.54 590.47 B: you you know when if a 

590.64 592.92 B: palestinian blew up somebody in 

592.96 598.36 B: israel he saddam hussein would give money to that to the dead guy's family 

598.06 599.95 A: right right 

598.48 599.89 B: saying oh that was a good thing
