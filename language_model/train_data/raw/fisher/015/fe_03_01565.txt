11.40 12.84 B: ridiculous 

12.68 24.16 A: ha i guess i'm a big sports fan so i can't live without my sports but yeah i think it's kind of i think it's kinda silly like get paid a lot of money to just have fun you know [laughter] so 

23.96 32.43 B: exactly it's a tremendous uh salary that they do bring in and you know i mean it's it's basically the entertainment industry [laughter] 

31.48 34.06 A: yeah it's pretty much entertainment yeah 

33.47 40.03 B: and uh you know it's it's it's out of the realm of normal sports so it now becomes you know when you go pro it becomes uh 

40.07 42.98 B: uh entertainment you know show business so 

42.31 44.49 A: yeah yeah 

43.06 54.91 B: um it's like movie stars the better better stars command higher pay for their movies and uh you know and the rest but uh you know going on strike [laughter] when you're getting how many million dollars a year 

52.57 53.35 A: (( ha )) 

54.60 61.64 A: yeah yeah i mean maybe maybe the maybe the underpaid i i don't know if there is such a thing as an underpaid 

55.04 55.63 B: (( [laughter] )) 

61.64 70.09 A: athlete 'cause i i think i've i've seen like out of the the four major sports in in the united states uh hockey baseball 

70.28 71.83 A: basketball you know 

72.15 77.35 A: i think i think they have pretty high minimum salaries so [laughter] i don't think they have to complain 

75.42 84.15 B: well ab- absolutely yeah yeah they've got a they've got a very very uh very liveable salary even even if you know the guys that are just starting out 

77.88 78.88 A: (( so [sigh] )) 

85.49 90.80 B: so i don't i don't understand why they would uh why they would even consider striking [laughter] 

89.81 102.86 A: [laughter] i mean i really don't know what i'd do i mean i hate when i hate when like i remember last last season base- in baseball i mean they were about to strike and [cough] i don't know it seems kinda ridiculous i guess um 

103.37 111.40 A: i don't know even what the terms were to that strike so it was it was something like they're being taxed too much or i don't know what was it do you know what it was 

111.45 117.24 B: well they just didn't like the being fined and penalized [laughter] and they wanted more money 

115.40 116.79 A: oh okay 

117.09 120.96 A: oh [laughter] that's what it all comes right back to i guess i mean 

120.21 129.53 B: yeah yeah but you know it uh you know like football players you know they they get they get fined for certain violations they commit but um [lipsmack] 

129.33 140.95 B: you know those guys are are hauling down some big bucks and you know well you know if you're gonna mess around with the with in the big league you you can expect to have big fines with big uh salaries so what you know what do you want 

141.24 150.37 A: i mean i guess that's the absurdity they're breaking the rules and they're playing in front of millions of people like on national t._v. i think i think they should have some sort of [sigh] 

150.22 160.87 A: a certain set of rules like you know behavior that they should abide by i guess if they're gonna p- get paid that much money and and then misbehave act act you know without class on the field so 

160.99 165.59 A: i guess it's it's i guess those rules are there for a reason i guess huh 

165.66 169.76 B: yeah maybe they got the idea to strike because uh all these uh 

170.12 177.09 B: [cough] all the fields are are you know naming rights are being sold to big corporations so they figure well what the heck you know 

175.25 177.47 A: oh the sponsorship oh god huh 

177.45 182.67 B: yeah they get they get the employee mentality and decide that they can go on strike you know [laughter] 

181.80 183.01 A: ugh 

183.43 192.64 B: but yeah how many stadiums do you know uh you know there are like well here in denver you know uh broncos mile high stadium well that's no more that's now called invesco field so 

192.21 194.11 A: invesco fields yeah 

193.56 197.89 B: yeah yeah so uh you know wh- what can you say [laughter] 

197.19 204.53 A: yeah i i liked the old mile high keep they kept the old high name but yeah i i remember that debate going on 

204.43 205.67 B: yeah 

204.76 212.40 A: and there's such a lot of sponsorship now i mean that's what pays for their salaries and i i guess high ticket prices 

205.96 207.14 B: (( well [cough] )) 

212.66 215.05 A: [mn] five dollar hotdogs and huh 

215.13 220.41 A: and sponsorship i guess that's what that's what keeps them in [laughter] you know professional sports 

215.36 216.36 B: yeah 

218.67 227.42 B: well well yeah well the the club gets a a cut of their of everything all concession sales and everything basically that goes on um 

227.57 232.80 B: you know in the in the field uh including you know tickets and stuff like that but 

232.31 233.97 A: definitely yes 

233.43 238.02 B: but uh you know the players i think it's just a matter of greed um you know 

236.56 237.48 A: (( hm )) 

237.91 244.19 B: a lot of them have a good lifespan you know as far as uh their playing ability they can go on for ten years and still 

244.02 256.49 B: you know still perform others others are kinda short term and maybe they're they're figuring they need to make uh you know three lifetimes' worth of uh worth of salary so you know in twenty years when they retire [laughter] 

254.26 257.41 A: hm yeah 

256.33 261.81 B: you know they could be like [cough] like john elway and buy all the oil dealerships in town and stuff 

261.82 269.18 A: yeah that's right here he is he has a pretty big cu- cut in the auto deal- auto industry in denver [laughter] [laughter] 

267.39 278.23 B: oh yeah yeah he's he's got his fingers in just about every manufacturer's dealership he's got got a he's got a john elway uh dealer for every make of car just about 

272.19 273.55 A: wow [laughter] 

277.77 279.55 A: wow yeah

279.62 280.33 A: (( and )) 

280.83 281.58 A: he's 

281.66 285.82 A: h- i guess he might be missing football but he's not missing the money [laughter] 

285.07 288.45 B: no no he's got other stuff that's doing it for him so 

285.99 287.09 A: maybe not 

289.68 290.70 B: (( [cough] )) 

290.03 301.81 A: i mean i mean sometimes you have these players that say they're they're not about money and they're not they're just about having fun playing the game ha winning ha but then but then you take their salary away i don't know how 

302.05 307.59 A: how many of them will stick around for that with that ha with that view i guess i mean 

304.96 306.75 B: yeah 

306.99 315.34 B: yeah but but you know as far as going on strike that kinda takes the you know the sportingness out of sports [laughter] 

314.07 323.60 A: yeah i think so i think definitely i mean this is i mean as as big i mean i'm i'm a big fan i was just finishing watching the n._b._a. playoffs right now and this 

323.11 324.29 B: (( yeah )) 

324.15 332.20 A: just you know like you have these guys ha they wouldn't be there if they weren't getting paid i don't know how many how many hundreds of thousands of dollars per game ha 

328.68 330.08 B: yeah 

332.63 343.91 B: well i don't uh i'm not a big sports fan unless of course uh the broncos are actually doing something or the nuggets are doing something but uh [cough] this time around nah [laughter] 

332.65 333.62 A: so 

342.37 344.28 A: no i know [laughter] 

344.37 346.95 A: broncos i mean they usually they usually yeah yeah 

344.69 345.70 B: but uh 

345.74 352.48 B: now the av- now the avalanches is a different story you know it's a they're all right but um you know these other guys i don't know 

351.33 353.71 A: they've been go- yeah they've been good for a while ha 

353.54 363.41 B: yeah [cough] so that's always that's always a good thing to watch but nah we're one of those people that stay glued to the t._v. set but but uh you know as 

363.20 378.10 B: you know i just i just can't understand what they do or talk about when they went on strike that was just that was just beyond me [laughter] i didn't think they could go on strike you know why why would they go on strike you know is there such thing as a union do they have a players union that calls them to go on strike 

368.75 369.69 A: yeah 

371.37 372.30 A: (( [mn] )) 

375.53 380.34 A: i g- there is there is yeah there is a union i think i mean um 

380.98 392.28 A: i know there's the players association i think that's a union but [laughter] i mean honestly they're really not i guess i mean they might be helping out the economy and and good cities but you know like they're not 

392.20 401.08 A: they're not going down in the coalmines or or in the steel factories you know doing some really dangerous stuff i guess so i don't know what they have 

401.46 402.23 A: (( to )) 

402.42 403.58 B: exactly 

402.81 404.64 A: argue about right there ha 

404.67 406.02 B: exactly 

405.27 407.43 A: and they say their job is dangerous 

407.71 410.96 A: maybe i mean maybe you play baseball ha you can get 

411.59 413.99 A: hit by a ball or something [laughter] 

413.91 415.08 B: right 

414.51 415.61 A: (( like )) 

415.81 417.28 A: roger clements 

417.65 422.66 B: yeah well the safety equipment they have now is is so much better than it was twenty years ago so 

422.39 423.80 A: definitely 

423.56 425.30 B: [cough] you know i mean 

424.30 425.36 A: definitely 

425.67 436.67 B: they and they got they got uh you know all kinds of all kinds of uh perks and bennies on the side and and you know they're they can sign for 

436.77 447.15 B: you know various products and endorse- -dorsements and you know they get money coming in from all all these manufacturers you know for endorsing their products and stuff like that so 

440.84 442.09 A: (( oh yeah ha )) 

444.17 445.08 A: (( well )) 

447.20 449.06 A: look at michael jordan ha 

447.35 448.22 B: (( you know )) 

448.35 459.28 B: it exactly you know and and the rest of them too you know and and for so for a for a professional athlete to go on strike is is kinda silly [laughter] 

449.43 450.68 A: [laughter] 

458.36 460.12 A: yeah i mean 

460.50 466.88 A: i've i- i- [cough] i really don't see especially baseball baseball is supposed to be the american pastime and then 

467.20 480.80 A: and then you have these guys just just throwing it all away i guess i mean that that just made this this past fall it just made me it just made me sad that to see that these baseball players you know like they say it's an ameri- an american sport and you know 

481.03 490.28 A: it's about the fans not about not about not about the money or not about the businesses but it it just ended up being that way i guess about the money 

484.79 485.73 B: [noise] 

489.01 489.99 B: yeah 

490.34 498.56 A: and this has disappointed me i mean i thought a lot of these guys that that would be against striking that would just like to play without money and i mean 

490.55 491.40 B: right on 

498.68 501.43 A: they were advocating the strike so 

502.30 513.74 A: i mean [cough] you've got alex rodriguez here in texas ha getting paid a quarter of billion dollars and he says it's not about the money but [laughter] it's hard to believe hard to believe 

511.44 512.81 B: oh right 

512.94 516.16 B: or yeah it's not about the money [laughter] 

515.13 516.19 A: [laughter] 

516.53 522.59 B: i i yeah it it is hard to believe [cough] you know if i was if i was getting that much i'd you know 

522.78 527.09 B: i don't know if i could say that [laughter] i'm a little too honest [cough] 

524.42 525.78 A: (( [laughter] )) 

525.97 528.11 A: i mean maybe maybe he was 

528.13 539.05 A: he's good but not that good [laughter] not not for a quarter of a billion there's there's a lot more important people in this world and they don't get paid that much they don't get the recognition so i don't know 

530.68 531.63 B: yeah 

538.21 539.31 B: yeah 

539.09 542.12 A: but it's that just shows how dominated by business 

542.07 545.03 B: (( well uh yeah exactly )) 

542.84 546.93 A: sports really is you go to the stadium and they have all these advertisements and ha 

547.17 548.29 A: and such 

547.21 551.34 B: yeah well maybe they maybe they're they're uh 

551.60 558.47 B: developing the attitude of these uh [cough] c._e._o.s and the rest of these these huge companies that that uh 

558.59 563.05 B: fleece the stockholders and take off with all the cash you know [laughter] 

561.89 564.84 A: yeah ha remember the enron thing in houston 

564.15 566.32 B: well exactly yeah that kinda stuff 

565.30 576.06 A: enron field ha that wasn't even their money you know [laughter] they didn't have the money to back it up but they they got the rights to the stadium ha somehow [laughter] that's what funny 

572.39 573.47 B: yeah 

573.86 574.81 B: somehow 

575.75 579.66 B: well they did huh [laughter] yeah [cough] 

578.27 583.77 A: that's a strange view that's a different topic i guess [laughter] but 

582.75 586.47 B: yeah well i don't know what they this this uh 

586.51 599.01 B: uh the subject they have us talking about there's only so much you can say about it [laughter] you can ex- you can express an opinion and that's you know that's uh that's it you could beat it to death also but 

590.29 593.26 A: yeah yeah definitely ha i guess 

597.00 598.07 A: yeah 

599.22 599.89 B: (( but uh ))
