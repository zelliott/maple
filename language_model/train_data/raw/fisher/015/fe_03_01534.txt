197.99 198.94 A: mhm 

200.23 205.41 A: yeah some of them are good guys and they do really help people and then 

205.72 207.99 A: you know others just you know 

208.13 214.49 A: take the money and buy expensive homes and expensive cars and just kind of blow it all you know 

214.88 215.92 A: so 

216.66 219.27 B: then they retire and they end up with nothing 

219.46 220.47 B: [laughter] 

220.17 221.33 A: right 

221.34 223.22 A: and here's the other thing 

223.78 224.84 A: when 

225.04 229.51 A: they have such huge salaries 

229.64 233.54 A: then it drives the price of a ticket up 

233.71 237.61 A: so if you are interested in sports 

237.74 241.20 A: it makes it impossible for a lot of um 

241.95 247.12 A: um people who don't have huge incomes 

247.20 252.75 A: ah it makes it impossible for them to buy a ticket and go see a sporting event 

254.45 255.73 A: um i 

254.78 256.44 B: (( yeah )) 

255.75 258.49 A: don't know if you have ever looked at the price of tickets 

258.84 264.57 B: well that's probably why i'm not a sports fan [laughter] i couldn't afford to be 

264.96 267.17 A: there you go you know 

267.62 269.40 A: i mean when it costs 

269.49 272.34 A: you know forty or fifty dollars for a ticket 

272.75 274.49 A: you know who can go 

275.12 276.09 A: so 

278.29 281.50 A: and i'm sorry i don't want to monopolize this conversation 

281.86 283.95 B: well i'm glad you are [laughter] because 

284.06 290.65 B: i'm not too much into sport you know i always i like to watch the superbowl 

291.68 298.85 B: especially if colorado is in there you know [laughter] and go to superbowl parties but 

295.27 296.19 A: uh-huh 

298.90 305.86 B: and i watch the game i understand the game and everything but you know unless i have you know 

306.22 308.89 B: something special i'm not really into 

309.13 310.07 A: mhm 

309.48 310.87 B: (( it )) 

311.53 313.64 A: yeah i like

321.84 324.63 A: i'm not into baseball too much 

325.05 328.96 A: i'm just really don't care that much for it it doesn't excite me 

329.27 330.27 A: (( of )) 

330.44 334.63 A: course there are other things like gymnastics and ice skating like 

334.83 335.65 A: (( you know )) 

336.31 348.73 B: [mn] i like football the best because my my dad was a foot- a high school football player and my brothers were high school football players and my dad was a coach 

344.65 345.48 A: (( ahah ahah )) 

349.11 352.44 B: so i really understand the game 

352.85 354.97 A: oh okay 

355.09 358.14 A: yeah i guess you would [laughter] 

358.69 366.00 A: you had a you had enough of them running around that you could get an idea and a clue as to what was going on [laughter] 

366.26 371.06 B: yeah well my dad wanted a a another boy 

371.07 375.87 B: and he always teased me that i had football legs and stuff [laughter] 

378.74 382.18 A: [laughter] did you tell him not on this earth 

383.43 384.44 B: what 

384.24 386.55 A: did you tell him not on this earth 

386.72 389.78 A: that you that you didn't want to play football 

389.61 400.11 B: well i tried well just just ah out in the front yard i i could pitch a good ball and and i could kick a ball and 

391.41 392.34 A: did you 

400.18 402.84 B: but when it come to games 

402.94 406.19 B: you know i didn't want to get out there with the boys and get tackled 

407.39 417.42 A: [laughter] yeah there is actually girls who are um in the game with the guys nowadays there's not too many of them but there are some girls that do that 

416.97 417.73 B: [noise] 

419.00 421.00 B: yeah i don't like falling down 

421.11 422.35 B: [laughter] 

424.39 432.69 A: all i can say is ah i was playing with my uncle when i was about thirteen and he tackled me and hurt me pretty bad 

432.90 442.07 A: and i decided that was enough of that and so we started playing some more and the next time he got the ball 

442.30 446.88 A: i tackled him and i knocked him to the ground 

447.53 450.75 A: and he was not real happy [laughter] 

450.86 451.94 A: (( so )) 

451.07 457.46 B: well when i when i was about five ah my brothers were out in the big yard playing 

457.56 463.39 B: ah my brothers and cousins were playing football and i got kind of too close 

463.57 471.76 B: and ah they tackled right beside me and one of their foots come up and hit me in the mouth and 

470.31 471.90 A: oh ouch 

472.23 480.58 B: ah my mouth was bleeding my teeth were loose they took me to the dentist and they said that they will tighten back up 

481.97 483.95 A: that must have hurt [laughter] 

483.65 485.62 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

484.50 487.75 A: especially if it was like a size thirteen you know 

488.65 490.67 B: yeah 

491.24 496.05 A: you know something else i think though too is that the professional players 

496.87 502.11 A: they really for their own sake should go out and get a college degree 

502.21 503.18 A: and 

504.38 507.45 A: and not and actually pay attention to 

507.68 511.57 A: what they're learning in college then if 

511.61 523.88 A: they can't play ball any longer um then they can take their college degree and go on and and have a career it's just like super models you know if you 

523.93 532.68 A: do something with yourself and that you have a career after your good looks fade or after your body turns to flab you know 

532.76 536.59 A: i mean you know then you've got something to fall back on but 

536.95 540.59 A: you know a lot of times they spend the money and then 

540.76 545.89 A: you know when they can no longer play the games then they don't have anything they can do 

546.23 547.13 A: (( you know )) 

548.05 551.37 B: yeah but but there's a lot of dumb ah 

548.36 549.18 A: (( yeah )) 

552.30 553.45 B: you know 

553.47 558.64 B: good football players that can make a good football player but can't make 

559.09 560.46 B: the grade 

562.24 563.98 A: mm you mean they 

564.23 567.03 A: aren't capable of learning when they are in school 

567.13 568.26 B: (( yeah yes )) 

569.60 572.41 A: i don't know i think there are some of 'em that are just 

572.47 573.64 A: lazy 

574.97 576.46 A: (( [laughter] you know )) 

576.62 582.67 A: of course then again too i guess some of the guys may deserve some of what they are making maybe not all of it but 

582.76 588.54 A: you know when you're playing like football and they get blown in the eaves and 

588.87 593.42 A: all sorts of injuries that may plague them later on you know 

593.86 594.85 A: so 

595.33 597.86 A: you know i guess they deserve some of it but i 

598.20 599.89 A: don't believe they deserve everything
