0.56 1.68 A: (( hello )) 

1.66 2.85 B: hello 

2.78 4.94 A: hi this is darshna 

5.43 6.72 B: this is sharon 

6.55 8.36 A: hi sharon uh 

8.94 12.60 A: i guess our topic for today is professional athletes 

12.71 15.92 B: and their striking and their high wages is that what 

16.20 17.61 A: that's right 

17.39 19.85 B: okay i'm from minnesota 

20.33 21.25 B: where do you 

20.42 21.05 A: oh 

21.13 23.21 A: so am i i'm from minnesota too 

23.11 24.51 B: oh where do you live 

24.44 27.21 A: um i'm i'm over in minneapolis 

26.88 28.46 B: oh okay i'm in buffalo 

28.43 30.89 A: oh okay and um 

31.14 33.79 A: [lipsmack] uh ha- have you spoken before here 

33.84 37.19 B: once before yesterday and it was the same subject 

35.44 36.37 A: okay 

37.07 38.33 A: oh okay 

37.80 40.15 B: [laughter] this is your first time 

40.01 41.64 A: uh yeah it is 

41.50 43.82 B: oh okay and do you 

44.12 47.59 B: watch uh team sports or how do you feel about the 

46.15 47.08 A: (( yeah )) 

47.42 48.38 A: (( i )) 

48.46 58.92 A: you know i actually think um i mean the topic uh that they've given that um yes i think that professional athletes do deserve the salaries they make because uh 

58.97 66.75 A: it's a talent basically they're getting paid for their talent and it's um you know not not everybody can do it and that's why they are where they are 

67.30 68.17 A: so 

68.04 71.44 B: see now i disagree with that because i don't think they're worth that much 

71.42 78.47 A: [laughter] yeah but some of it is extreme but you know um it's it's because you and me 

72.01 74.10 B: [laughter] 

78.50 85.26 A: cannot do it like you can have you know millions of engineers but you cannot have too many randy mosses there 

86.35 89.45 A: so you know they they deserve it 

90.63 95.90 B: um i don't know that they nee- i don't think that they deserve in the millions though [laughter] 

95.26 96.35 A: [laughter] oh okay 

96.68 98.75 A: well why do you say that 

96.72 98.11 B: and because i 

98.58 103.02 B: because then i think the tickets are too high when you want to attend and 

102.32 103.65 A: (( oh [lipsmack] )) 

104.48 107.17 B: and like you know then there's the 

108.41 110.26 B: all the refreshments or the 

110.34 111.68 A: yeah 

111.06 113.80 B: have to be so expensive to cover everything 

114.51 120.19 A: yeah but then i'm i'm guessing that would be the case with not just sports but you know if you had to go 

120.13 130.90 A: even let's say if y- you go to a movie it's not that you're paying cost price for um refreshments or you know it's it's high there too so it's just a high band of people 

131.02 140.56 A: so many people at one place it's the stadium that you pay for i'm guessing salaries is just like a percentage of but that's what i feel but 

139.63 143.62 B: no i mean everyone has their prerogative or or what they feel you know 

143.50 144.66 A: yeah 

144.47 146.79 B: um i just see it that 

147.51 153.03 B: more common persons if they didn't make them at such high wages then the more common people could go 

153.61 154.52 B: um 

155.09 159.80 B: i just think there's a lot of people that can't attend but then they can watch it on t._v. a lot too so 

159.66 168.99 A: that's right i mean i mean i i do feel that they deserve it but i also feel that there should be some kind of a pattern or some kind of some some kind of rules 

168.85 178.38 A: that they should use to offer salaries like like now you know um players get paid just just what they feel like or you know teams offer 

178.49 186.53 A: a h- really really high wages to get the player in which is maybe not fair at all times but 

185.59 187.15 B: mhm 

187.01 194.92 A: [lipsmack] uh if if they lay down a set of rules by which you know there there's a max like in football there's a cap which is good 

195.04 200.75 A: and um i think that kind of helps contain the salaries for players 

201.04 206.24 B: yes i agree with you that there should be some kind of cap or some kind of limits that they can't you know 

206.45 207.66 A: yeah 

207.49 208.74 B: (( or um )) 

209.00 211.00 B: or a certain amount that 

211.16 217.71 A: yeah because otherwise you know um one team which has the money has all the good players and it's not a fair game 

216.84 218.07 B: exactly 

218.36 224.48 A: yeah yeah but that way that way football is you know it's really good 'cause 

218.94 220.28 B: i agree with that 

224.36 225.09 B: (( [mn] )) 

224.67 226.26 A: all the teams have a cap 

227.04 237.01 B: and like i don't think like soccer and hockey have gotten out of proportion here but i think basketball and football have i don't know about baseball i don't follow that a real lot but 

233.58 235.05 A: yeah 

236.78 242.21 A: yeah yeah that's true basketball is really really out i think 

241.90 243.19 B: out of proportion 

242.91 244.80 A: yeah absolutely 

244.43 245.50 B: yes 

245.50 251.19 A: 'cause kids like sixteen year old kids out of high school get paid millions of dollars which is 

252.03 253.35 A: pretty stupid 

254.47 257.40 B: and i think some of these kids like um 

258.10 259.69 B: uh what's his name rick 

260.21 261.38 B: (( rykid )) 

261.66 262.67 A: i'm sorry 

262.69 267.47 B: oh the one basketball player that plays for the golfers this year um rykid 

267.67 269.49 B: (( he's from dalliworth )) 

267.68 268.80 A: oh okay 

268.86 269.93 A: yeah 

269.86 271.52 B: i think um 

272.36 274.44 B: you know he wants to go professional 

274.54 275.82 A: yeah 

275.00 281.73 B: because i've i've heard that when they sign up they immediately get a million dollars so i don't think he's ready to go professional yet but 

281.26 286.52 A: yeah that's true yeah the get the signing bonus which you know kinda gets to their head 

282.72 283.80 B: (( and then he's )) 

286.40 289.27 B: right and they should finish college first but then 

289.63 295.25 B: i guess if i was in his position maybe i would do the same thing too because if you ever got injured then you wouldn't 

295.82 298.15 B: [noise] have that opportunity again 

296.30 302.88 A: yeah 'cause 'cause these are for some for some people it's just a one season game and if you're injured that's it you're done for life 

302.53 303.45 B: right 

303.90 304.91 A: so 

304.48 305.26 B: oh 

305.23 309.06 A: it's it's such a i don't know it's a neverending debate you know 

308.87 312.11 B: like you said if if we don't have the talent um 

312.29 316.41 B: they have the they have the talent they have a gift for it and uh 

316.66 329.01 A: yeah but now that you know you talk about it i think yeah maybe you know it's a little overboard and it you know if they can contend some kinda rules that should be good 

330.89 333.37 A: so players feel accountable then 

333.52 334.43 B: right 

335.05 336.42 A: yeah 

335.06 337.16 B: 'cause once in a while you think well 

337.37 341.98 B: gee they're getting such a mountain they're not playing that good tonight maybe [laughter] or today you know 

340.98 342.80 A: [laughter] yeah that's true 

342.29 346.35 B: [laughter] maybe they don't care anymore 'cause they know they're gonna get such a high wage anyway that 

346.27 353.70 A: yeah that's what like you know or you you see randy moss playing in one game he doesn't play good and i'm like you know what the hell are you getting paid for then 

353.36 360.39 B: yes [laughter] and exactly look at the example he's setting for the young people and the dumb things he does once in a while [laughter] it's like 

354.14 355.52 A: [laughter] 

359.36 362.41 A: [laughter] 

360.93 363.36 B: [laughter] i mean he should be uh 

364.98 368.03 B: you know setting a better example for our young people [laughter] 

367.38 377.84 A: absolutely 'cause 'cause all the kids are s- you know so into sports and they'll they'll idolize people like randy moss and kevin garnett and if these people are going to set examples like 

378.05 381.84 A: you know getting into crime and stuff it's not good 

381.84 382.73 B: (( no )) 

383.99 385.00 A: yeah 

385.31 386.19 B: (( so )) 

386.74 392.25 A: it's it's nice it's nice to discuss you know topics like these with some people you don't know 

392.21 393.92 B: [laughter] 

395.19 398.04 B: did you sign up with the r._m._c. or 

399.06 400.89 A: um i'm sorry 

399.83 401.10 B: on the internet 

401.43 403.25 A: yeah yeah 

402.93 405.49 B: with uh refunding makes cents 

405.09 406.42 A: yeah 

406.06 407.66 B: yes that's what i did too 

408.10 410.19 A: and i i didn't get your name 

409.96 410.92 B: sharon 

410.78 412.67 A: sharon oh i'm sorry 

413.72 414.61 A: (( sharon )) 

416.16 418.01 B: this is your first time you said 

418.19 419.81 A: yeah it is [laughter] 

419.63 420.39 B: oh 

419.90 424.15 A: i i was kind of wondering you know whether you have to kind of have a pro and a 

424.28 426.88 A: um anti debate or [laughter] 

426.41 431.18 B: (( [laughter] no well you see me when they called me the first time i i really you know i was so [laughter] )) 

430.99 431.94 A: [laughter] 

431.83 440.42 B: i hadn't even got the email back yet as to what is expected of me so i really flobbed that one up 'cause i didn't know what to say or do [laughter] i had no idea 

437.76 439.09 A: [laughter] 

440.44 444.88 B: i guess the day before it was about nine eleven so or ni- you know nine one one 

444.95 448.26 A: oh okay and uh does does 

447.15 449.95 B: uh not nine one nine nine eleventh you know so 

449.92 453.63 A: yeah oh it was uh it was about nine eleven 

454.92 455.90 B: yes 

455.79 456.64 A: oh 

456.10 458.26 B: uh how it's changed your life or 

458.04 462.69 A: oh okay so does this go off on its own or do you hang up or 

462.71 470.21 B: no in in ten minutes they'll tell us you know and then you say goodbye and say you know talk about what you know [laughter] 

468.96 470.08 A: (( oh okay )) 

470.35 472.83 B: pretty much what what we've said already you know [mn] 

472.49 473.56 A: yeah 

473.75 487.32 A: but you know there's another thing like when when we talk of sports over here it's really like these three games like say basketball ice hockey football and soccer that's it but other sports you know it's not it's not so big 

487.71 494.68 B: no they don't get the wages i don't think like i said before i don't think they get the wages like the football and the basketball players do and 

494.22 501.43 A: yeah 'cause these are the only four games i think that are r- really really popular and you know it's all hyped up 

501.47 503.43 B: mhm 

502.24 506.63 A: but otherwise i think it's it's pretty regular it's like a regular career 

508.30 512.30 B: but i don't know that anyone else makes that much money in their career in the usa 

512.15 514.72 A: [laughter] yeah that's true 

512.73 515.88 B: [laughter] and and other people are really talented too 

515.96 519.89 B: the lady i talked to yesterday was from tampa florida and she um 

515.98 517.01 A: yeah 

520.05 523.77 B: well she was more into um hockey and ice hockey

534.40 540.00 B: ice blading or i don't know what she or roller blade yeah she called it roller blading i didn't even know what she was talking about so

542.12 547.24 A: oh yeah they have that it's it's not ice skating it's roller blading on ice 

546.95 550.24 B: oh see i i had no clue what she was talking about so 

549.75 555.69 A: yeah i saw a high school game on t._v. so that's how i know that they have a sport like this 

553.60 554.63 B: oh 

555.49 557.78 B: but is there professionals with that too 

557.52 560.04 A: yeah they have professional teams 

560.01 561.68 B: (( mhm okay )) 

560.83 563.19 A: but it's not big though it's not that big 

563.08 565.24 B: well certainly not in minnesota 

564.89 567.19 A: yeah [laughter] 

565.65 567.01 B: [laughter] 

567.56 568.76 A: that's true

573.43 575.48 A: yeah that was a good game 

574.17 575.11 B: but i 

575.43 577.85 B: but i don't know how they could pay this well 

578.28 579.93 A: it's i don't think they 

579.95 582.55 A: they get paid really really huge by it 

582.52 583.57 B: i doubt 

583.41 584.33 A: yeah 

584.30 589.17 B: i mean if if it is it's not advertised as much as like randy moss or kevin garnett or 

584.34 585.33 A: (( it's pretty )) 

588.71 594.93 A: yeah those people really really get paid a lot of money i wild um they don't get paid millions
