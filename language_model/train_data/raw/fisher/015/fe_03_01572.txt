54.72 55.95 B: yeah 

55.91 63.08 A: well let's see our job is to talk about this uh the professional athletes and the money they're paid 

63.32 64.68 A: what do you think 

64.70 69.91 B: i don't follow sports and i think that the amount they get paid is ridiculous for what they do [laughter] 

69.43 78.39 A: oh i do too i do too i i i really agree with you and e- especially when you compare it to other important 

78.42 86.32 A: jobs in society that are just much more important you know like teachers [laughter] for example 

85.38 91.25 B: teachers make forty thousand a year and work their butts off and have to deal with bratty kids all day and [laughter] [lipsmack] 

90.36 99.33 A: yeah yeah and uh because they're so poorly paid i think a lot of people they they have a goal of doing that but then they leave the 

99.62 108.65 A: the profession and and the thing about the athletes is it i i don't begrudge them making 

108.58 121.95 A: five hundred thousand a year even even seven hundred and fifty a year maybe even a million a year but they make so much more than that uh because of all the endorsements and you add everything together it's just 

121.88 128.36 A: it's phenomenal and it makes it so expensive too to go to the games 

128.65 132.55 A: it's very expensive do you ever go up to s- see the lakers 

132.50 133.63 B: [noise] no 

134.31 139.42 A: well it's uh i want to say it's at least seventy bucks um 

134.41 135.88 B: not at all [laughter] 

138.52 145.26 B: oh my gosh i i my sister's going next week she said she got tenth row seats i've no idea how much she paid but 

139.65 141.41 A: yeah isn't that awful 

144.99 151.02 A: oh she paid a lot [laughter] although the lakers aren't having a real good year so maybe they're 

151.24 153.49 A: they're cheaper um 

153.26 155.47 B: but not that cheap [laughter] 

154.56 163.53 A: no no absolutely not um [lipsmack] and did you follow well you don't follow too much is there any sport that you follow 

162.50 167.08 B: not at all i don't follow sports at all [laughter] 

165.38 175.91 A: [laughter] well i'll to be honest with you the only reason i do is i'm married to a person who really follows sports a lot 

175.84 180.52 B: i'm single i live with by myself so [laughter] so 

178.61 181.79 A: oh do you [laughter] well [mn] 

180.67 184.61 B: the sports are never on this house [laughter] 

182.83 191.76 A: uh-huh so you don't know but you but you uh uh were you into the angels at all last season when they won the worl- the world series 

191.85 194.01 B: um a little bit you know 

193.34 196.07 A: yes you were aware of it huh 

195.77 197.92 B: yeah i didn't really watch it though 

197.65 198.72 A: yeah 

198.09 204.46 B: i'm too busy i work all the time and i just don't have time to sit around and watch things like that on t._v. 

203.92 211.37 A: well see that that's my case too and and when i do have time um you know maybe it's a fifteen minute thing 

211.45 218.25 A: and you know isn't that interesting because the pro athletes who are making all the money are all 

218.32 227.19 A: men pretty much other than i guess uh the female ice skaters probably do pretty well but i would think it would only be a fraction of what a 

227.61 230.82 A: a basketball player or baseball player would make 

230.10 232.96 B: oh their salaries are nowhere near what they make 

232.31 234.58 A: yeah yeah and they 

233.90 237.69 B: and then their pension is ridiculous 

237.52 240.04 A: oh i didn't know that really 

238.05 238.74 B: (( they )) 

239.03 248.20 B: oh my gosh i've met i've met some people married to or you know friends of friends who are you know ex rams or whatever and they get a pension when they retire 

248.29 252.17 B: um you know if they retire at forty they get a yearly pension that is 

248.80 249.77 A: wow 

252.12 253.44 A: huge huh 

252.98 259.30 B: huge a pension i mean it's it's not like a pension that we would get [laughter] in a normal job it's huge 

254.66 255.67 A: wow 

257.42 264.67 A: right yeah you work until you're seventy and you know most of its gone 'cause you lost it in the stock market [laughter] 

260.09 262.75 B: it's huge you know 

263.92 269.57 B: it's hu- you know i i don't remember exactly you know i was talking to a girl recently that i met 

269.60 273.83 B: down in newport beach and her husband was a a player a football player but 

274.15 276.19 B: it was huge the amount 

276.17 278.45 A: how um amazing 

277.36 281.23 B: it was like more than most people l- make in a year 

280.94 295.00 A: yeah yeah well you know i kinda i don't have a problem um with professional athletes making a real good living because i think their bodies take such an abuse 

281.62 282.84 B: for a pension 

295.24 301.16 A: and th- they i think they make a lot of um personal sacrifices 

301.18 314.71 A: uh but the big thing that bothers me is just when you compare what they do with other critical jobs i mean like the people defending our borders you know 

314.81 320.71 A: uh or the people who are the airport screeners i mean where do they get those people [laughter] 

321.06 334.35 A: and i- if we had better uh training and and uh better salary skills in some of these jobs that are so important i mean hospital workers are poorly paid for what they do and yet that's so important 

332.97 334.31 B: yeah 

335.11 338.91 B: they should balance in the distribution [laughter] of money 

336.55 337.63 A: yeah 

338.59 352.48 A: yeah yeah there [mn] uh totally isn't i don't know what the top paying i i wonder who the top paid athlete is if it's some [lipsmack] you know like a colby bryant kinda guy or if it's like a tiger woods 

352.99 354.77 A: i don't know what pays more 

353.13 361.89 B: i don't know it's probably close i would guess with their endorsements tiger has so many endorsements i would say it could even be him because he has huge endorsements 

360.00 360.89 A: uh-huh 

361.56 366.12 A: yeah he sure does he's a lot more visible than uh 

366.18 370.27 A: colby michael jordan's still doing quite a few endorsements 

369.88 372.60 B: um but and he just played his last game 

372.22 374.89 A: yeah that's right yeah 

374.39 378.11 B: yeah but but the endorsements are more than their salaries sometimes 

378.05 386.35 A: oh yeah yeah if they're in that top group i was up one time for business and uh visited the nike headquarters 

386.63 396.66 A: and it's a it's a huge campus on a big big plot of land lots of grass they have playing fields and all the employees are encouraged 

395.77 397.36 B: in portland 

397.01 399.38 A: yeah outside of portland 

397.86 398.90 B: yeah i've 

399.07 404.39 B: i i went by there actually i mean i didn't go there but i drove by it 

401.15 402.56 A: oh it's so pretty 

404.08 409.11 A: it's pretty cool inside we had a a complete tour of all their complex 

409.11 417.40 A: and uh you know went through their board room and it was it was neat but the thing that was really interesting is 

417.33 430.80 A: um each floor of all these separate buildings was kind of like commemorating a particular sports figure and i'm sure they have all new ones now you know different ones uh 

430.70 440.05 A: but uh they really accounted so much on the celebrity endorsement that makes such a a big difference 

440.25 443.95 A: in uh you know how those businesses do 

444.31 450.40 A: i i i don't know why i would never listen to a movie star about anything [laughter] 

449.74 452.63 B: [laughter] i work in the film business 

451.15 454.15 A: or a celebrity not a movie star 

453.09 458.82 B: i know i work in the film business for fifteen years and and i don't understand why people idolize 

458.87 462.61 B: movie stars and athletes so much [laughter] 

460.54 467.30 A: yeah it's it's like you would get your opinion from them [laughter] what makes them 

467.41 471.30 A: e- experts at anything other than what they do 

469.20 472.90 B: they're not they're not at all but 

471.87 472.75 A: yeah 

473.13 476.86 A: how funny yeah so what kind of work do you do now 

476.84 483.60 B: um well i i became disabled last year and so i had to quit working in the film business and so 

482.83 483.69 A: yeah 

483.62 486.92 B: hopefully i can get back to work i had an operation on my spine 

486.95 489.37 A: oh i hope that's going well for you 

489.14 493.30 B: yeah i can walk now so i was in a wheelchair last year for a while but um 

493.56 495.88 B: [lipsmack] so i'm hoping to get back to work this year 

495.74 502.42 A: yeah yeah well i i uh got laid off from my company so i'm looking for work too 

502.48 503.77 B: what did you do 

503.84 514.07 A: i was in sales and traveled quite a bit [cough] i had eleven states that i was responsible for and was with my company for eighteen years yeah 

513.12 514.80 B: oh my gosh 

514.39 522.59 A: yeah i know it's really hard to look right now you know and you know that's another thing getting back to these athletes 

522.64 529.01 A: is you know when you think of the money they just blow 

528.16 530.78 B: way oh my god 

530.68 531.81 A: yeah 

531.90 540.99 A: i mean uh it's unbelievable how they will just blow money and and they're always and uh movie stars i think are the same way they're 

541.09 544.58 A: going through the bucks and buying everything they want 

545.02 552.19 A: which then they you know kinda lose interest in my husband did a lot of work for years with different uh 

552.04 565.47 A: celebrities and oh my gosh they were you know they'd work on a house a custom home for five years and get all the furnishings everything perfect and then a year and a half later they would sell it [laughter] 

565.02 566.24 B: (( [noise] )) 

566.86 569.52 A: i would never do that [laughter] 

569.41 571.85 B: but just just not even that the 

570.17 571.32 A: that would be 

572.01 576.49 B: limousines and you know going out and blowing money in 

576.18 577.16 A: yeah 

577.27 584.53 B: in bars just you know buying everybody in the bar you know taking their entourage and having tabs that are just 

581.02 582.01 A: uh-huh 

585.21 586.88 B: so ridiculous 

586.50 590.77 A: well in gambling i think a number of 'em are into the gambling thing 

590.64 591.67 B: yeah 

591.18 595.94 A: and of course i guess they have money to lose so they don't care 

595.15 599.95 B: but the kind of money they could waste in one night i could live on in a year [laughter] 

599.07 599.89 A: yeah no
