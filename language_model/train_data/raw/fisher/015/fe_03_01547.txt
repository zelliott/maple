33.23 35.11 B: that's right [laughter] 

34.24 37.60 A: so what do you think about this baseball strike 

37.47 42.26 B: well you know i don't really know too much about it i didn't even know they were on strike 

41.08 46.62 A: well they're not but they were gonna and they settled uh before the season 

42.38 43.09 B: (( oh )) 

44.97 46.16 B: oh okay 

46.71 51.92 B: oh now i think i remember my husband telling me something about that yeah they decided to settle 

48.14 49.11 A: (( you know )) 

49.47 50.48 A: yeah 

51.73 52.91 A: and uh 

53.53 61.21 A: and i think that uh i don't follow it that closely but my son especially and grandsons do 

61.15 62.18 B: uh-huh 

61.34 62.50 A: and uh 

62.56 66.27 A: i just think it's they get too much money as it is now 

66.10 72.67 B: oh i think you're right about that i i would think most people agree with that it's it's really insane how much money they make 

72.09 74.44 A: oh it's out of sight so 

73.97 75.68 B: and then they complain 

75.27 76.13 A: (( yeah uh )) 

76.57 79.92 B: mm yeah and you have 

77.64 78.43 A: so 

78.57 86.67 A: i don't agree with it but if they in the future if they do strike i hope that the fans don't go back to see 'em when they settle 

86.54 89.09 B: right well didn't they strike at few years ago 

86.94 87.81 A: give 'em a 

88.67 99.19 A: they did and uh you know they settled it i guess at the last minute or something but but then it came up again this year and with all this 

89.87 90.86 B: yeah 

93.86 95.50 B: mhm 

99.48 101.40 A: baloney and 

100.72 103.88 B: well i wonder if attendance was down after that first strike 

103.01 113.10 A: well i think attendance has been down and the here we have the oriels down in baltimore and uh [mn] they to- you know raising the 

108.04 109.02 B: uh-huh 

113.31 117.31 A: fees to get in so a lot of people can't afford anymore 

116.97 122.52 B: mm yeah i'm sure how much it is here but i know attendance is not good we have a double raise here 

117.71 118.42 A: (( so )) 

122.13 123.45 A: right mhm 

122.68 128.34 B: and um people just don't go there's hardly anybody who goes i don't think they can give away those tickets 

127.69 142.00 A: yeah well when you listen uh uh uh sometimes uh you know when the news comes on the radio and then the sports shows come on and i'll just not turn it and that it's a i guess it's across the nation it's down 

142.20 146.99 A: for what it cost and i know my son likes to uh go 

147.24 148.33 A: and uh 

148.50 149.16 A: (( uh )) 

149.17 161.43 A: well they were just down to florida and on the way home they stopped and saw a pro game but he takes the two boys and they'll go you know out of their state to see games and uh 

162.27 165.91 A: then they go to milwaukee to see the brewers and uh 

165.75 166.76 B: (( mhm mm )) 

166.08 174.42 A: you know they'll travel around that way but he was saying about you know getting in with a decent seat it's getting you know out of sight for the price 

173.55 180.21 B: isn't that something mm i guess they have to charge a lot to justify the or to pay their salaries 

175.30 176.24 A: so 

178.30 182.38 A: well yeah the they're the salaries and [mn] um 

182.74 191.27 A: and i don't think now they're getting as many people coming out there so they have to think i guess they keep raising them 'cause they're not getting the fans out 

190.53 195.21 B: mhm mhm yeah and so that's kinda cutting off their nose to spite their face 

191.94 193.17 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

194.54 198.48 A: that's it so [mn] after a while um 

198.94 205.96 A: they won't have any fans because even those that can afford it won't be able [laughter] to afford it anymore if it keeps going up 

200.52 202.09 B: mhm 

204.54 218.48 B: that's right well you know it's not like an essential service like uh these airlines the airlines are just sort of talking about going on strike if people do have to fly i know they can take a different airline but people don't have to go to baseball games 

208.15 209.94 A: (( no no )) 

217.47 219.80 A: no that's true so 

219.16 220.57 B: so maybe 

221.05 224.12 A: they they'll price themselves right out of the market 

221.09 222.13 B: baseball 

223.69 230.17 B: yeah maybe so and they can use that money for something something good for the good of society or something 

230.39 242.33 B: it seems to me you know these folks are making i don't know how many millions of dollars and then you hear about people who are trying to get money for researching cancer or whatever and they can barely scrape up a few thousand and it's insane 

240.05 241.79 A: yeah that's it 

242.85 243.91 B: (( real insane )) 

243.01 244.21 A: (( and um )) 

244.81 250.82 A: in other fields i mean there are there are just so many places are going bankrupt and cutting back or 

250.49 252.74 B: mhm 

250.82 263.25 A: you know laying off and all and [mn] my husband's a bethlehem scale retiree and they just went bankrupt and we lose our medical insurance and his life insurance 

261.49 262.72 B: oh no 

263.28 265.78 A: as of april first and uh 

265.68 267.07 B: oh what a shame 

266.45 277.38 A: so and then you see these salaries [laughter] that ball players are getting and my husband worked for thirty two years in an office job uh you know hard and 

269.63 271.53 B: mhm 

276.18 276.88 B: mm 

277.30 283.29 A: went every day and thought he had everything you know [laughter] nice for retirement and now it's taken away 

281.33 282.44 B: sure 

283.27 285.93 B: oh that is such a shame i'm sorry to hear that 

286.48 289.01 B: that's really too bad 

286.54 287.36 A: (( yeah )) 

289.20 295.82 B: yeah it's just not fair it's the same with the entertainers you know they make so much money so yeah the musicians and that kind of thing 

292.22 294.38 A: oh that's true that's true 

296.28 299.13 B: it's not something that we need and you know i just 

299.49 306.79 B: mm i always watch you know what's going on in the research institutes around the country and they're just not able to raise money for their research it's not fair 

304.66 306.02 A: that's it 

307.04 308.03 A: and so 

307.09 310.24 B: but i guess it's supply and demand 

308.26 308.98 A: (( [mn] )) 

309.96 321.07 A: well my uh my husband goes for kidney dialysis and one of the men there is a diabetic and he had to have his leg taken off below the knee and he's in his late seventies 

321.29 325.56 A: and his doctor had to write uh 

325.68 326.72 A: (( to the )) 

326.85 332.00 A: agent uh the insurance company that was going to you know put the ful- 

332.19 341.84 A: funds forward for his knee prosthesis whether he would you know what was his health did he really need this at his age and all 

335.91 336.70 B: mhm 

341.78 342.89 B: oh boy 

342.29 347.51 A: and finally they you know okayed it and he has the 

347.65 360.69 A: it needs to be filled in it's just you know the metal bore coming down with a hood on it but to make it look like a real leg they wait until you're used to it you know and then then they fill it in 

353.67 355.24 B: mhm 

358.50 359.39 B: (( i see )) 

360.55 362.38 B: mhm 

360.79 370.35 A: and now he has to go through that again and i thought jeeze these ball players they get all kinds of treatment with all the money they make and all [laughter] and nobody asks them 

368.10 370.14 B: mhm 

370.40 379.06 B: that's right and then you have the ones who are um uh doing drugs and alcohol and going to jail and getting into fights 

370.50 371.32 A: (( you know )) 

374.82 375.79 A: (( yes )) 

376.84 385.51 A: and then they take 'em right back again you know instead of getting rid of 'em that's not good for the kids to see things like that for their idol 

379.29 380.77 B: yeah 

380.85 382.30 B: that's right 

383.84 395.11 B: absolutely not yeah that's right 'cause they are making all this money using it on drugs and then not getting any into any kind of trouble for it so you're right that's not 

386.24 386.87 A: (( no )) 

392.37 393.25 A: no 

395.18 396.81 B: not the right thing to see 

396.83 410.62 B: and my husband says that um a lot of these baseball players baseball is not one of the more charitable of the sports you know some of the football players some of the golfers whatever they give a lot of money to charity but he said that these baseball players don't give any 

407.41 408.36 A: uh-huh 

410.65 416.55 B: or you know very little compared to the other sports and here they are making all this money and going on strike 

414.93 415.80 A: yeah 

416.83 429.31 A: well i know here the wives always have things going to you know to promote uh funds for cancer and different research here in in baltimore 

425.64 427.62 B: mhm 

429.17 430.91 B: oh okay well that's good 

429.37 435.63 A: and and some and like when kel rifkin well he still gives a lot that way but 

435.33 437.05 B: oh well that's good 

435.76 443.74 A: um [mn] so but not i i don't know too many others that i could i can't say one way or the other [laughter] 

443.45 444.61 B: mhm 

444.22 445.42 A: and uh 

445.66 448.90 B: a lot of them are not from the united states a lot of them i think 

447.50 450.29 A: that's the trouble too there's so many from 

450.51 452.35 A: out of our country so 

451.75 456.73 B: mhm the different islands and mexico or wherever they come from cuba somewhere like 

454.12 455.15 A: yeah 

455.44 457.64 A: and the japanese and [laughter] 

456.74 458.93 B: that yeah japanese 

457.93 464.11 A: uh they're from i i think there's more of them [laughter] than there are of one's raised here you know 

461.78 464.76 B: i think you're right uh-huh 

464.55 465.37 A: so 

464.85 473.87 B: yeah i think that's right and no- you know that doesn't mean they should make less money but still um you know they're maybe that's why they don't have the same kind of views about charity 

468.62 469.49 A: no 

473.60 475.15 A: that's it i 

475.12 476.12 B: (( i don't know )) 

476.90 477.76 B: (( mm )) 

477.74 480.01 A: well a lot of 'em from uh 

480.18 484.45 A: mexico and and south america and central are 

484.47 492.20 A: the- they're deprived countries to start out with so i don't know what they do you know to give back to their own countries or what 

491.49 495.44 B: yeah and maybe they do maybe there's things we don't know about here 

493.13 494.64 A: maybe i don't know 

495.74 504.43 B: um you know with the strike the whole idea behind the strike i know my husband always says if they were in their own country they'd be making [laughter] you know a dollar a day or 

497.93 499.70 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

503.20 504.78 A: peanuts [laughter] 

504.53 514.01 B: yeah they'd be making you know nothing they'd be working in a field or something and just because they can play baseball and got lucky to come over here or something and then they complain 

505.08 506.17 A: yeah 

508.02 508.93 A: yeah 

514.54 515.34 B: so 

514.97 520.12 A: well i i can't see it i think they're overpaid all of them myself but 

515.53 516.80 B: that's really the thing 

519.70 522.14 B: mhm oh yes definitely 

521.53 525.68 A: now if i had that talent i'd probably be happy [laughter] to take the money though 

524.68 529.84 B: yeah you probably wouldn't think the same thing i know um until we're in their boat i guess we can't uh 

528.91 536.16 A: yeah [mn] excuse me but but uh you know i think they're looking for more and more and more and more you know 

530.04 532.07 B: criticize 

532.22 533.98 B: but it's very unfair 

535.33 536.96 B: mhm 

536.26 537.70 A: and they get these 

537.73 545.36 A: huge salaries and then they're injured or something that they don't [laughter] even play or they don't come up to what they thought they were gonna do 

542.25 544.06 B: that's right 

545.07 548.85 B: yeah or they're just having a really bad season and i guess still they get money 

549.52 550.37 A: (( [cough] )) 

550.52 553.48 B: yeah the worst thing is when they're not even playing yeah 

550.82 552.43 A: that's strange 

553.70 556.20 A: mm have you done many of these surveys 

556.22 563.55 B: this is my third one so i guess that's they told me i would have between one and three so i guess this is my last one how about you 

557.45 558.74 A: third mine's just 

562.37 563.11 A: (( oh )) 

563.29 567.55 A: this well this is my third one and they called the other night and 

567.41 582.03 A: uh the phone you know went sort of dead for a minute and i thought it was changing over and the next thing the operator came on and said if i wanted to make a call please hang up [laughter] so i don't know if i got anything for that or not 

571.10 572.02 B: uh-oh 

577.47 580.48 B: oh so you got disconnected 

581.75 583.74 B: oh probably not no 

583.31 585.56 A: i doubt it so 

584.79 589.50 B: because i know they were saying you had to talk for the full ten minutes to get paid [laughter] 

587.45 588.08 A: (( uh )) 

588.10 591.87 A: yeah well i didn't see the check for the first one so 

591.79 593.10 B: no i haven't got 

591.94 594.37 A: i'm waiting to see [laughter] 

593.39 598.93 B: yeah i've gotten anything yet i suppose it could just be a scam huh [laughter] [laughter] 

596.40 598.23 A: yeah you never know 

598.62 599.89 A: well i've talked to
