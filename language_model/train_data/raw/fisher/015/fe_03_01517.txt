1.79 3.17 A: yes 

2.87 4.44 B: hi [laughter] 

3.66 5.98 A: hi [laughter] i'm sharon 

5.88 6.96 B: i'm nicole 

6.64 8.19 A: hi nicole how are you 

7.99 9.23 B: good how are you 

8.79 11.63 A: oh i'm good thanks this is my first one so 

11.15 12.68 B: oh it's mine too 

12.34 13.61 A: oh okay 

13.31 15.50 B: (( [laughter] )) 

14.08 19.45 A: [laughter] well i guess we get to talk about this i wonder if they come back on or if we just go ahead and go 

19.37 24.79 B: i don't know i think we just go ahead and go 'cause they said that they'll notify us when ten minutes is up 

24.57 25.49 A: okay 

25.38 27.10 B: so okay 

25.96 29.30 A: well i think i think it's outrageous what they get paid [laughter] 

28.63 32.12 B: (( yeah i do too [laughter] )) 

30.11 36.69 A: yeah um and to go on strike because they want more money is even more outrageous [laughter] i 

35.87 40.13 B: right now are have these strikes been been recently also 

40.70 41.66 A: um 

41.81 54.54 A: i haven't heard of anything like within the last few months but i know you know in the past probably year or so i mean they've had those baseball strikes and they're you know threatening you know strikes here there and everywhere 

49.27 50.05 B: right 

54.38 55.40 B: right 

54.55 58.56 A: i i remember hearing about a threatened strike 

59.33 73.03 A: [sigh] i guess it was toward the end of the season baseball season just before the world series because i remember hearing talk about that might not be paid played because of um you know an impending strike but i guess 

71.65 73.97 B: right i do remember that mhm 

73.32 77.90 A: yeah but i think they worked all that out because the world series did go on 

77.68 79.18 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

78.09 78.66 A: (( um )) 

79.50 82.70 B: yeah i i agree with you i think that it's 

83.21 96.21 B: and i think especially in light of you know the current world events and i don't know if you've seen any of the information out there about you know how much money our the the military makes and 

96.41 100.67 B: firemen and police men and teachers and and the people who 

101.67 102.63 B: have 

102.65 107.53 B: such a great responsibility and such a great influence um 

107.84 110.38 B: and to compare that to 

111.61 115.12 B: sports player [laughter] 

112.72 115.90 A: and it's quite disproportionate 

115.80 117.74 B: right exactly 

117.29 122.21 A: yeah i mean you know they are they are risking 

122.45 135.84 A: permanent injuries that you know in some cases they could be if they were hit the wrong way they could be paralyzed from the neck down um you know i understand things like that you know achilles tendon 

135.85 140.07 A: injuries and things like that are quite painful but 

140.36 143.65 A: you know to be paid way more than 

143.73 147.30 A: [laughter] i mean many times over what the president makes 

147.34 151.57 A: you know who's at risk every day of being killed 

149.89 150.81 B: uh-huh 

151.58 158.52 A: by anybody um i don't know i just don't think it's it's quite you know right um 

159.12 163.42 A: and there's other people that i think are being paid way too much besides but uh 

163.55 165.31 A: you know the athletes 

165.38 168.01 A: do make too much i think way too much 

168.82 170.44 B: right um 

171.45 175.31 B: [mn] yeah i agree and it it also seems like um 

175.97 178.43 B: oh i'm not sure how to 

178.66 191.67 B: how to express that [laughter] but you see them getting paid and i i guess you know there are there are many of them who um you know do all sorts of things with uh charity and um 

180.85 181.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

191.72 192.79 B: um 

191.83 193.39 A: that's true yeah 

193.45 196.27 B: so that's a benefit but um often 

196.42 201.16 B: along with all those positive things that you see that they do with charities um 

201.54 205.16 B: you also see what else [laughter] the money goes towards 

203.27 204.11 A: yeah 

204.39 217.72 A: yeah it's like we have one of our bucks just you know was arrested for an altercation after some kind of a traffic incident i don't think it was an accident but an incident basically road rage uh 

217.05 217.86 B: right 

217.93 219.11 A: you know that 

219.51 226.59 A: it brings a lot of negative publicity to the teams and when people are being paid that amount of money 

226.75 230.06 A: they should make sure that everything they do 

230.07 233.25 A: is absolutely perfect and beyond 

233.63 237.74 A: any kind of questioning or reproach by anyone uh 

236.96 246.68 B: right i agree and then often those are those are the people that our children you know look up to as as idols and um yeah so 

242.74 244.00 A: exactly 

246.83 250.52 A: yeah yeah and you know the it they need to be more 

250.84 257.79 A: uh conduct themselves a little bit better i mean not to say that they can't be you know have their own lives and be human but um 

257.21 258.44 B: exactly 

258.35 259.31 A: (( you know )) 

259.84 266.27 A: it's just like the president if the president can go out and have road rage because that would reflect negatively on his position 

261.53 262.39 B: right 

266.05 267.25 B: exactly 

266.17 268.81 A: and these these high paid 

268.71 271.11 A: uh athletes should 

270.87 284.98 A: be just as social conscious as anyone else or more so because they are like you said idols for the kids uh they're people that they wanna emulate but if they're going to be having you know negative behavior 

284.82 288.22 A: then that's not something we want the kids to emulate at all [laughter] 

287.86 289.36 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

288.49 298.82 A: you know we want to see we want them to see them in a positive way when they're doing you know different community affairs and helping i mean there's some some of the bucks here that um 

298.96 308.76 A: go buy a house for somebody on- you know one or two a year you know for a family that needs it uh most of the time it's a single famil- uh a single parent family 

301.25 302.09 B: right 

303.12 303.91 B: right 

308.60 321.11 A: and that's great and i think those kind of things should get more publicity so that you know maybe the the negatives don't get as much focus with the youth as the positive that these people are doing 

321.16 323.76 B: right yep i agree with you 

323.62 324.62 A: yeah 

324.01 324.87 B: um 

325.21 328.19 B: yeah as far as the strikes go um 

328.20 330.17 B: [laughter] um 

330.97 335.86 B: yeah i think that to demand um 

336.35 339.20 B: to demand more almost seems 

339.87 348.00 A: obscene [laughter] like public ra- public rape almost [laughter] sanctioned rape 

340.67 343.84 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah 

345.13 347.70 B: right [laughter] 

347.87 349.78 B: right [laughter] 

348.68 361.93 A: yeah i mean i don't know i mean some players are more valuable than others but um maybe if there if professional sports as a whole had some kind of um 

362.67 364.43 A: salary capping 

364.64 377.41 A: i mean sure they'll give it to them in other ways a bonus or something i you know you hear about that all time where they rework the deal so they give them a lower salary but then they get these higher bonuses um 

376.26 377.22 B: right 

377.62 383.39 A: you know if they wanna do that that's fine but i think that you know the salary you know the 

383.95 385.62 A: salary you know 

386.90 401.42 A: should be brought to something that's more manageable because some of these kids just see that and they think oh wow man that's what i'm gonna do and if something happens or they're not that good then they it doesn't inspire them to do anything else so by putting 

401.49 405.35 A: high price tags on on athletics 

405.73 416.77 A: as opposed to intelligence in other areas like encouraging them to go into um you know chemistry or math or you 

416.96 422.05 A: know ah maybe that was our ten minutes maybe that's you know maybe that would uh 

417.10 418.03 B: (( [noise] right )) 

419.19 419.93 B: oh 

422.08 430.07 A: you know would help to get our youth into something that was more constructive in the long run for the whole society 

430.16 440.10 B: right exactly that's in fact that's exactly what i was going to to say too is um sports you know it's wonderful we have entertainment um and 

440.14 441.67 A: (( [noise] )) 

440.87 454.37 B: you know that's certainly a a benefit and a positive thing and um but right with the the rest of the society needs to function we need to have doctors and [laughter] uh school teachers and 

451.26 455.00 A: mhm yeah we need to encourage them to go other ways uh-huh 

454.82 456.47 B: right mhm 

455.76 456.97 A: exactly 

456.99 460.04 A: yeah i guess that was our ten minutes huh 

459.86 462.85 B: you think that did they say anything or was it just kind of a 

461.88 465.71 A: it just went that [noise] kind of sound 

463.86 467.47 B: oh i didn't even hear the beep i just heard a pause 

467.22 468.02 A: oh 

468.28 472.37 A: i wonder if they actually come on and say anything or they just um just do that 

472.16 473.70 B: i don't know 

473.05 479.90 A: it would be nice if we you know i mean this is our you know this is our first time so we'd we would like to know what's supposed to happen 

479.73 481.68 B: right [laughter] 

480.81 487.17 A: well that might have just been i don't know i wasn't watching the clock so i don't know when we got on the phon- maybe my phone will tell me 

487.67 489.81 A: (( my phone will tell me how long the call was )) 

489.67 491.39 B: oh okay that would be great 

490.41 491.83 A: yeah let me look hold on 

491.60 492.41 B: okay 

495.23 499.57 A: oh it says it's been nine and a half minutes so i guess they single us at the end of eight 

497.40 498.18 B: oh 

499.61 502.03 A: was that what it was yeah 

499.76 502.85 B: oh maybe maybe they give us a two minute warning 

503.13 505.50 A: yeah or maybe it 

505.57 508.09 A: 'cause i know the calls were supposed to be eight to ten minutes 

508.02 509.24 B: oh okay 

508.23 511.05 A: so maybe they just let us know at the end of eight 

511.23 512.22 B: okay 

512.13 515.44 A: now do we just hang up or do we have to wait for something 

513.83 514.75 B: (( i don't know )) 

515.06 518.77 B: [laughter] [laughter] um 

517.53 518.82 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

519.39 526.33 B: well do we have any other opinions concerning that that we can [laughter] for another minute or two yeah 

523.43 524.33 A: um 

526.67 529.53 B: i think we've probably extinguished most of it 

529.28 533.43 A: yeah yeah we're we're not in favor of strikes 

529.61 530.50 B: um 

533.37 534.37 B: right 

533.77 540.68 A: and we're not in favor of the high [laughter] salaries and the reasons that they are striking if they were striking for a good reason 

538.47 539.40 B: right 

541.59 542.57 A: like 

542.88 545.02 A: they were protesting 

546.24 547.50 A: something 

546.53 551.04 B: more humane treatment maybe they were getting really lousy treatment by the coaches 

547.92 548.97 A: mhm 

550.69 552.16 A: mhm 

551.48 554.02 B: or something like that [laughter] 

552.93 559.05 A: or not even anything to do with them that they were striking because they wanted um 

561.10 563.90 A: better government regulation of 

564.12 567.73 A: maybe i don't know something drugs or whatever 

567.58 568.55 B: right 

568.09 571.12 A: or you know or to get more police 

570.94 572.08 B: right 

571.34 576.85 A: you know if they were doing it to make some kind of a social point for the public welfare 

577.48 582.11 A: then yeah maybe it'd be okay but because they're going out because they want more money 

581.76 583.06 B: right 

582.65 587.29 A: when well some of the athletes don't make i mean football players make the big bucks 

587.22 588.25 B: right 

587.46 592.24 A: but um you know like basketball and baseball they don't make anywhere near as much 

592.50 598.94 A: and that's why i think there should be some kind of regulation as to you know salaries limits capped 

599.00 599.95 A: maybe even
