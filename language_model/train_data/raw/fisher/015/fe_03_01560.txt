399.28 400.06 A: (( oh )) 

401.07 408.12 B: although my next door neighbor listens to such loud rap music i don't think they would notice if i was uh being killed in here okay it's off 

407.87 415.46 A: i said you're lucky it sounds like you have two phone lines you were able to answer the phone call from the university of penn at the same time as the computer's on 

415.18 416.94 B: well i'm not on the internet 

416.60 418.27 A: oh you're not on the internet okay 

417.98 419.82 B: (( no i just turned on my computer )) 

419.43 427.09 A: 'cause i you know i miss more of these phone calls from the university of penn friends whatever because i'm just so addicted to the internet 

427.26 430.98 A: and we only have one phone line and i don't want to pay for a second phone call oh 

430.33 436.72 B: mhm well if you have broadband you can also uh you know that stuff i know about [laughter]

444.48 447.12 A: what's this broadband does that have a fee 

446.32 452.20 B: well um if you have that you're able to actually be on the internet at the same time as being on t- on uh the phone which is really good 

450.44 453.16 A: i know but there's probably a fee right 

452.54 455.74 B: oh yes [laughter] absolutely 

455.05 459.13 A: that's what i'm trying to avoid that's why we don't have two that's why we don't have two phone lines 

456.65 457.65 B: yeah 

459.24 461.48 B: um when i was living on campus on i had uh 

461.50 464.38 B: (( my own private line anyway so i get could more calls ))

471.81 473.16 B: exactly 

473.28 474.08 A: (( mm )) 

474.66 479.33 A: i wish there was more guidelines to this if we're supposed to strictly talk about sports or 

479.37 480.86 A: or what [laughter] 

480.12 482.83 B: i have no idea the only thing in sports that interests me 

482.84 485.44 B: (( is ass [laughter] )) 

484.35 486.33 A: maybe they're going for women 

485.72 487.45 B: (( i don't know anything about sports )) 

487.42 489.39 A: (( uh maybe they're just seeing )) 

489.45 494.76 A: uh that as a starting place i you know like i said there's no guidelines you don't really know what they're looking for 

494.31 495.49 B: that's true 

496.69 506.54 B: well it sounds like they're they're referring to their salaries so maybe it's like the moral issues of whether or not they deserve it whether entertainment is something that actually should be paid 

505.88 509.95 A: mm yeah but what are our guidelines i mean how are we only allowed to talk about that or what 

506.99 508.63 B: (( high salaries i don't know )) 

509.09 510.91 B: (( i have no idea ))
