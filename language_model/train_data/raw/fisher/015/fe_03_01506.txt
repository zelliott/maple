137.35 139.28 B: they l- they're wannabes huh 

140.78 141.75 B: oh 

143.02 144.11 B: yeah 

144.33 145.99 A: um where are you where are you from

147.08 148.90 A: okay well i'm in tennessee 

148.55 149.63 B: okay 

149.20 154.46 A: i can understand you a little bit better than i could the girl i talked to earlier she was from oregon 

151.14 152.37 B: oh really 

154.09 162.29 B: oh well she shouldn't have had an accent i'm originally from north dakota and they usually start teasing me about words like wheat and 

154.78 155.51 A: so 

162.49 170.22 B: uh i can't think of the other one now but anyway i must still have a north dakota twang because every once in a while they go [laughter] 

169.51 171.42 A: oh [laughter] 

170.25 171.78 B: [laughter] 

172.29 173.62 B: (( but um )) 

172.97 180.69 A: um well as i was telling her i think people probably have that live in new york or you know right around up in there where all that stuff happened 

179.49 181.88 B: i was just gonna say that yeah but 

181.11 186.02 A: i think probably they have made more changes than yeah than the rest of us 

182.99 185.28 B: the more the most yeah 

185.75 191.95 B: but i on this on the uh internet i got uh into the homeland um 

191.96 192.66 A: have 

192.55 197.28 B: website so that they email me was the terror with you know 

196.79 197.64 A: mhm 

197.39 199.40 B: um with the alert 

199.08 201.57 A: (( oh really mhm )) 

199.60 204.80 B: ranges yeah yellow orange or whatever and uh then um 

204.94 213.04 B: [lipsmack] they give you um information there and and so i do get that i'm i usually beat it and delete it but i mean 

209.60 210.46 A: mm 

213.14 218.63 B: it just seems like it's um [lipsmack] more m- a little more personal or maybe 

216.27 217.83 A: (( mhm )) 

218.22 220.32 A: (( mhm )) 

218.61 231.18 B: more accurate than some of the um news you might just get part of the news saying or sometimes you miss you know our communication is really hard and i think that's why they're saying this because i can say something to somebody and they 

222.99 224.66 A: (( yeah )) 

231.09 234.40 B: th- like they just misunderstand me entirely 

233.63 239.88 A: oh absolutely yeah and you could say something you think you're sending one message and the person is yeah yeah uh 

236.65 241.63 B: yeah you think you're saying it very clear but [laughter] but no 

241.74 247.35 B: and so um i l- i that's why i think i like to tune it right to that direct site 

246.93 253.77 A: yeah that is an interesting point what you just made about why they're studying this i never really thought about exactly why 

247.97 248.88 B: but my 

251.66 255.63 B: yeah i think that this must be something like that 

255.21 265.81 A: that's right when i'm telling somebody something and i really want 'em to understand what i'm saying i'll ask you know i'll ask them to you know if they understand what i'm saying you know i ask 'em to repeat it back to me 'cause i really wanna you know 

262.88 263.72 B: uh-huh 

265.66 266.58 B: yeah 

265.81 270.39 A: be sure especially i think in personal relationships you kinda really need to do that 

269.54 271.69 B: well i know they said um 

270.78 271.41 A: (( [laughter] )) 

271.73 284.06 B: to some some motivational speaker i went to once said you know if you're talking to someone you really wanna listen you should repeat what they say back to them just like mcdonalds repeats your order back to you 

278.69 279.73 A: (( yeah )) 

280.28 282.33 A: (( mhm )) 

283.71 285.11 A: (( yeah )) 

284.20 287.18 B: and then you'll know that you're both on the same beam 

286.67 287.58 A: mhm 

287.41 290.33 B: but that's not always easy to do [sigh] 

289.90 299.18 A: well a lot too the other times person's not listening they're too worried about what they're gonna say and making their point you know and so they're they don't listen to 

294.52 296.08 B: yeah uh-huh 

296.36 297.21 B: right 

299.36 301.82 A: what's being said to them [laughter] 

300.53 307.03 B: [lipsmack] i think that's true as i get older too i have more trouble um focusing because 

307.07 310.72 B: i have to kinda think of what i'm gonna say because um 

309.19 310.14 A: yeah 

311.18 314.75 B: otherwise i forget what the whole topic [laughter] 

313.47 321.54 A: yeah well i usually kinda kinda multi task when it comes to that you've gotta be listening and then thinking about what you're gonna say at the same time yeah 

316.34 318.10 B: (( was exactly )) 

318.97 333.58 B: exactly i know when my kids were your kids' age i that's what you know i knew who closed the door i wasn't in the room but i knew it and i knew who was over there making that noise and i knew somebody was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 

326.09 327.76 A: (( mhm )) 

329.91 333.87 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

333.58 341.96 B: and all those things and my husband could never understand because he wasn't that way he could sit there and tune everybody out and focus on whatever he wanted to do 

336.51 337.37 A: how you 

337.49 338.44 A: yeah 

339.79 340.61 A: yeah 

341.27 342.20 A: mhm 

341.98 344.99 B: i never have been able to do that have you 

343.66 349.62 A: yeah i know what you're saying no um not usually [laughter] 

347.76 352.43 B: you can't really distance yourself from the home that you're supposed to be the 

350.01 351.16 A: (( uh-uh )) 

352.67 355.00 B: h- the homemaker or whatever in 

353.91 360.04 A: yeah i guess men can or for the most part they can disengage because that's just not their role i guess you know 

359.68 360.70 B: yeah 

360.07 369.19 A: where women you know you can't just you can't just turn that part of y- off it when it comes five o'clock or something it just keeps on going [laughter] and going yeah 

365.35 366.24 B: right 

366.57 372.31 B: well we've got that brain that connects and they've got the one [laughter] that's more one sided 

371.70 380.80 A: yeah that's true [laughter] we'll just bash men during this conversation we won't even [laughter] 

372.70 373.66 B: so 

373.78 376.67 B: [laughter] but 

377.85 380.23 B: oh the oh let's not do that 

380.38 386.61 B: but but it's true i mean they do they are able to focus more um and tune out stuff 

384.83 387.20 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

387.53 388.81 B: but uh 

389.85 394.03 B: well if we didn't change too much since nine one one 

394.11 397.74 B: then um do we know anybody that did 

397.44 398.80 A: um 

400.88 403.24 A: i don't think so i mean i really 

402.97 404.05 B: i do 

403.85 405.82 A: oh do you okay 

404.84 419.47 B: my b- my brother who still lives in north dakota went out and bought two gas masks for he and his wife and two for his daughter and son in law now i don't know what he thought his mother was gonna do and i don't know what he thought the baby was gonna do 

407.48 408.30 A: uh-huh 

410.61 412.02 A: (( really )) 

418.53 419.90 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

419.57 423.03 B: but he went up to surplus and bought four gas masks 

422.35 423.22 A: mhm 

423.15 429.74 B: and [lipsmack] um short of wrapping his house in plastic he didn't do that but he got a generator 

427.05 428.25 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

429.80 430.84 B: and 

430.91 431.62 B: [sigh] 

432.12 436.13 B: i don't know i guess i don't know what motivated him i [lipsmack] 

433.22 434.04 A: well 

435.48 436.27 A: yeah 

436.62 448.82 A: either well that's g- that just reminds me of the y. two k. thing but i i do know people who know people that you know done that kinda stuff but i don't personally in you know my circle of people i don't really know anybody that's 

439.64 440.64 B: yeah 

443.84 444.68 B: yeah

452.37 453.35 B: okay 

453.02 453.76 A: (( no )) 

454.69 457.73 B: i kind of had a theory that maybe it was 

457.90 458.98 B: um 

459.09 462.28 B: something about our church that um 

463.11 467.03 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] helped us know there was somebody else in charge of [laughter] the whole thing 

466.71 468.40 A: yeah so you don't have to 

467.40 470.01 B: but that may not be true but i mean 

469.14 472.11 A: worry about it or yeah yeah 

470.06 482.12 B: yeah well yeah you don't you have more peace about it i i thought but see i might've been all wet i don't know i just was a i just the thing that flashed in my mind i thought well that's why he's all upset and i'm not 

481.68 482.54 A: mhm 

483.00 484.25 B: but anyway 

485.18 494.26 B: [sigh] um i don't know anybody in [mn] the area in texas where i live that did anything other than maybe take in a little extra water 

494.18 495.12 A: yeah 

495.28 507.21 B: but they said that the stores were short on duct tape and all and i did see there at walmart uh little walmart had added a lotta duct tape but i didn't you know it's still there [laughter] 

495.45 496.95 A: (( yeah )) 

504.28 512.08 A: yeah well i remember there for a short short period of time that people were kinda going on a a shopping spree for for those items but 

509.26 510.23 B: yeah 

510.96 512.87 B: stuff like that 

512.19 514.75 A: i don't think it really lasted in our 

513.97 516.27 B: i don't either and mostly 

515.01 515.80 A: (( you )) 

516.29 527.90 B: do you wonder if it's maybe media hype that does that because they were saying now these are things you should have and dah dah dah dah dah and they kind of rile people up into a frenzy 

518.88 520.70 A: (( know oh abso- yeah )) 

522.07 522.95 A: (( yeah )) 

523.88 524.79 A: (( yeah )) 

527.19 539.12 A: yeah that's why well i didn't i don't i guess i kinda don't worry about it or don't do it 'cause i don't i don't think there is that much you can do about it anyway i mean w- what are you really gonna do what exactly can you change

557.04 559.86 B: [laughter] yeah especially if somebody gave you a ticket huh
