0.84 2.23 A: hello i'm 

0.93 1.95 B: (( hello )) 

2.61 3.84 A: (( stephanie )) 

4.01 5.70 B: hi stephanie i'm leah 

6.27 7.36 A: how are you 

7.60 10.11 B: good how are you where are you calling from today 

10.13 12.91 A: um i'm in san francisco 

14.47 15.99 B: i'm in seattle 

15.50 17.48 A: [noise] oh okay [laughter] 

18.83 20.49 A: so um 

21.51 31.23 A: i guess for september eleventh i think um i haven't travelled as much as i probably would have liked 

31.29 32.20 B: mhm 

31.48 46.05 A: um especially to far away places um the farthest i've gone maybe is just an hour flight away you know i don't want to go very far because i don't know what could happen [laughter] basically 

46.69 47.60 B: mhm 

46.92 50.43 A: so so i think i've cut back on my travelling 

52.39 53.59 A: what about you 

54.46 55.57 B: (( um )) 

56.43 60.80 B: i yeah i've done less travelling but it's mostly been because 

61.32 63.96 B: air fare has just gotten so difficult 

63.90 64.87 A: uh-huh 

64.57 69.40 B: yeah and i find it's kind of a pain to go through airports 

69.54 70.86 A: yeah 

70.79 77.66 B: i feel i feel actually kind of confident that we're not gonna probably see another issue crop up on an airplane any time soon 

77.40 78.36 A: uh-huh 

78.61 86.18 B: so you know part of me is like oh my gosh okay people are just you know the airplane industry is just 

86.46 87.56 B: kind of 

88.59 93.81 B: over reacting and it makes it just more difficult for us to 

90.27 91.16 A: uh-huh 

93.95 98.72 B: and then in a way that means the terrorists have won because they've changed the way we live our lives 

98.99 100.05 A: yeah 

100.81 102.24 A: um do you think 

102.78 110.60 A: that you know since they already used the airplanes then they might be using something else instead because you know 

110.93 113.75 A: not that many people are flying basically 

110.96 111.91 B: yeah 

113.96 120.44 B: yeah i definitely think they're probably gonna be using something else [noise] i mean i'm more concerned about shipping containers 

120.69 121.56 B: than 

120.78 122.16 A: yeah 

121.93 122.99 B: airplanes 

124.83 133.92 A: or what about like the food that um is grown in other places or something you know do you think that um 

134.25 137.81 A: they might try to do like bio terrorism or 

137.94 140.27 A: adjusting the food or anything like 

138.01 138.61 B: (( mm )) 

140.52 143.82 B: (( i hadn't actually thought of that before what do you think [noise] )) 

142.60 144.38 A: that oh [laughter] 

144.86 149.47 A: i don't know i think if that happened that would suck but [laughter] um 

149.91 152.78 A: i don't know 'cause i read somewhere that 

152.96 161.33 A: um it's hard for the government and other i guess people with higher power to 

161.48 168.29 A: go into the farmlands and you know restrict the the farmers from 

168.46 169.41 B: mhm 

168.83 181.99 A: doing whatever they do to their produce and things like that because the the farmers you know they have their own business usually and it's up to them what they want to do and you know it's hard to keep track you know 

182.01 182.91 B: mhm 

183.48 184.86 A: so i don't know 

183.57 184.54 B: and then 

185.00 185.97 B: is it 

185.22 186.65 A: oh go ahead 

186.26 188.03 B: is it hard to then keep 

188.75 195.18 B: ah keep an eye on what then gets into our food chain i mean once they get to the supermarkets and stuff 

194.86 196.48 A: yeah 

197.00 199.02 A: i don't know [laughter] 

200.99 201.97 A: but 

204.54 207.91 B: [noise] yeah i don't know too much about the food shipping industry 

208.01 211.90 B: or what what controls they even have [noise] 

210.89 211.93 A: mhm 

213.50 223.36 B: but i don't know i mean it's really hard to say and then i'm actually surprised we haven't seen um more of the suicide bomber kind of attacks like you see in other countries 

222.02 223.51 A: yeah 

223.77 225.22 A: yeah 

225.82 226.62 A: but 

226.69 229.70 A: i think you know some of them 

229.95 231.46 A: some people are 

231.99 233.03 A: um 

233.16 236.12 A: suicide bombers during the war right 

236.33 237.27 B: mhm 

236.33 237.19 A: (( i think )) 

237.24 240.44 A: i think they were still doing that but 

240.59 241.86 A: (( i don't know )) 

242.27 244.41 A: you mean you ah 

245.80 249.97 A: you would expect to see more of that here or no 

249.93 253.63 B: yeah yeah i mean i feel like we haven't really seen 

254.25 261.29 B: seen that at all you know especially when you think about oh even places like ireland 

256.24 257.41 A: yeah 

261.03 262.04 A: uh-huh 

261.84 265.52 B: where things are just blowing up all over the place it seems 

265.80 266.96 A: yeah 

267.30 268.68 A: (( that's true )) 

270.39 272.13 B: so do you feel that um 

273.34 274.40 B: you know 

274.57 278.32 B: things close to you have have changed [noise] um 

280.33 286.00 B: i know i've got some friends who have had to go and register themselves because they're from other countries 

285.90 287.30 A: oh really 

287.01 291.33 B: and it's really kinda scary because in seattle there were a whole bunch of people 

291.50 297.19 B: from middle eastern countries who had to register and then a bunch of them got arrested for 

294.29 295.32 A: (( uh-huh )) 

296.33 297.70 A: really 

297.47 306.24 B: for not having their papers in order and sometimes their papers really weren't in order and sometimes it was just an administrative glitch but you know 

299.92 300.75 A: oh 

304.73 305.75 A: mhm 

306.31 311.77 B: it makes me kind of upset for my friends who have to go through this and be treated this way [noise] 

311.41 312.87 A: yeah 

313.71 318.24 A: i haven't experienced anything like that it's just um 

318.53 322.05 A: i guess for me when the war the war 

322.38 325.16 A: the war yeah when the war started um 

324.78 325.64 B: (( mhm yep [laughter] )) 

326.43 327.59 A: um 

327.61 333.41 A: i i have to cross a main bridge over here every day to go to work and 

333.37 346.71 A: you know the day of there was all these helicopters around the bridge 'cause they wanna keep an eye out and stuff and then it's just like oh i don't wanna go to work anymore i don't wanna you know risk my life trying to work and 

346.54 359.99 A: all that kind of stuff and then later you know that was just the first day and then as the weeks went by there weren't any helicopters there and i was just like okay i thought they were trying to protect us and now 

351.98 352.80 B: mhm 

360.00 362.49 A: you know there's nobody there [laughter] so 

362.40 363.46 B: mhm 

364.95 368.84 A: but i mean at first i was like oh what are they going to do 

369.05 378.86 A: up there flying around you know that's not gonna help us you know we're on the bridge and nobody else it doesn't seem like they're doing anything on the ground level you know 

379.07 385.34 A: they're just up in the air protecting whoever i don't know [laughter] but yeah 

383.27 384.10 B: (( [laughter] )) 

385.37 387.91 A: that the only difference i've seen 

388.05 401.76 A: um and then of course when i did travel a little bit um the security in the airports and all that but sometimes i didn't feel they were being um very thorough with their checking 

402.24 403.30 B: mhm 

403.85 404.99 A: yeah 

404.38 411.49 B: yeah i heard an interesting thing recently which is [noise] ah you know how that guy tried to light his shoe on fire 

412.05 414.20 A: oh a while ago right 

413.40 416.60 B: yeah yeah a while back and um 

415.13 416.07 A: uh-huh 

416.99 425.22 B: apparently one of the things you can still bring on to planes is lighters and matches and all sorts of other incendiary devices 

425.01 426.29 A: really 

426.03 427.63 B: like you can't bring 

427.73 430.75 B: toenail clippers but you can you can bring a lighter 

429.80 433.20 A: (( i know [laughter] um okay )) 

433.30 435.86 B: [laughter] yeah that's pretty weird 

435.67 437.48 A: yeah because i mean 

437.49 450.43 A: it's still it could still be harmful to someone you know why would they they shouldn't even allow that because you're not allowed to smoke on the airplane or anything right 

441.85 442.80 B: mhm 

450.32 461.76 B: yeah yeah well 'cause the reason the tobacco industry lobbied so hard to get it to get it allowed is because they wanted [noise] whoops 

451.38 453.00 A: that's kinda odd [laughter] 

461.78 467.07 B: they wanted people to be able to light up as soon as they got back to to the ground 

466.32 467.62 A: oh 

467.92 472.44 B: and so they didn't want to have people have to go looking for matches 

472.27 473.20 A: (( uh-huh )) 

473.49 474.93 A: and so 

475.02 478.47 A: the airline industry okayed that [laughter] 

478.23 479.56 B: yeah they did 

479.53 480.58 A: huh 

479.95 483.26 B: because tobacco's a really big lobby 

483.14 484.39 A: yeah 

484.98 490.58 B: and so then you've gotta wonder well then you know are they really doing it because they care about 

491.01 491.87 B: [sigh] 

492.63 498.23 B: because they care about our safety or are they just doing it because they want to create the illusion of safety yeah mhm 

497.96 505.05 A: mhm or are the just doing it to um make money or make profits 

505.02 516.34 A: because if they just allow people to just start smoking you know right after they get out of the plane then they're encouraging smoking and you know all the 

516.49 518.55 A: they're neglecting all the 

518.82 521.10 A: causes it has and so 

521.32 527.37 A: they know it's harmful to people but they just it it sounds like they just want the money from it you know 

527.36 528.39 B: yeah 

529.88 530.64 A: so 

532.40 533.15 A: (( um )) 

532.41 536.11 B: [noise] yeah i guess we still have a few minutes left 

535.07 536.31 A: [laughter] 

537.56 538.70 B: (( um )) 

540.72 543.38 B: yep it's been over two years huh 

543.81 545.30 A: (( yeah [mn] yeah it has )) 

546.40 547.16 A: (( but )) 

547.28 550.14 A: (( i think it's gone by kinda fast )) 

551.91 552.95 B: what's that 

552.75 555.63 A: [laughter] i think it's gone by sorta fast 

555.50 556.74 B: mhm 

556.77 558.14 A: yeah 

558.94 566.42 A: actually when it happened it was a couple of days before my birthday i'm like oh jeez what kind of birthday's this you 

566.52 567.42 B: uh-huh 

567.62 572.11 B: and ah does every time your birthday happen does it remind you of it now [noise] 

572.64 576.07 A: know mm not really i think well i think you 

576.25 579.81 A: know people still talk about it and so 

580.02 586.51 A: i i'm reminded of what happened but i don't really you know dwell on it or you know 

586.59 590.12 A: i just have to move on and you know 

591.12 594.45 A: don't not to live in fear or anything or 

594.98 599.16 A: you know get all sad about it [laughter] because it's in the past now
