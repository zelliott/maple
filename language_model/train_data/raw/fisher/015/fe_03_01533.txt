17.90 19.77 B: hold on a second i gotta a dog 

19.80 20.90 A: yeah i hear 

22.49 24.29 B: okay now can you repeat that one more time for me 

23.79 26.36 A: yeah i just said it's probably warmer where you are 

26.27 28.77 B: well i it's yeah probably [laughter] 

27.95 29.12 A: [laughter] 

29.15 31.37 A: so you've got the spurs down there huh 

32.00 33.53 B: (( ah yeah )) 

32.81 35.37 A: san antonio spurs are you a sports fan 

35.40 36.36 B: no 

36.36 40.29 A: okay [laughter] i am sort sort of 

38.95 44.36 B: well well not basketball anyway we're not we don't think too kindly of the spurs down there 

43.83 47.38 A: oh well our timberwolves are just going into the playoffs 

47.52 48.40 B: really 

48.08 54.64 A: but i don't have much hope for them because they're going to play like the best team from last year they'll be out after the first round 

52.51 53.13 B: (( hm )) 

54.89 55.70 B: well 

55.44 56.75 A: it's pathetic 

56.80 61.86 A: [laughter] but it's the best they've ever done so they're getting there [laughter] 

60.28 61.02 B: (( [laughter] )) 

62.61 63.61 A: anyhow 

62.64 63.68 B: so i guess 

64.16 65.30 B: what's our topic 

65.99 67.01 A: do you think 

66.19 67.99 B: strikes by professional players 

67.30 71.83 A: yeah do you think they should be allowed to strike do you think their salaries are too high 

72.01 74.21 B: oh yeah yeah well 

72.01 72.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

72.85 73.89 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

74.28 76.66 B: yeah i definitely think they get paid too much 

76.33 78.98 A: mhm i agree with you 

78.15 79.71 B: uh yeah 

79.76 82.56 B: and you know if they don't if they wanna strike let 'em strike they 

82.86 85.48 B: usually have a reason for it but [sigh] 

85.96 95.20 B: you know i don't i don't really pay a whole lot of attention to it because like i said they get too much and if they're striking because they're no making enough money then they can bite me for lack of a better word 

94.92 102.02 A: mm yeah because it doesn't really hurt us when they go out on strike not like the teachers are striking or the airlines or the bus drivers 

98.52 99.34 B: (( uh-uh [noise] )) 

102.18 103.76 B: yeah exactly 

102.65 106.75 A: that's inconvenient if there's no baseball 

104.95 112.35 B: yeah but i i mean and striking striking like in protest to the war i think somebody did that or something but that i can kind of agree with it because then they have a 

112.44 117.07 B: logical reason for it but striking just because you know they are not getting 

113.95 115.07 A: mhm 

117.10 118.11 B: something 

118.52 119.60 B: (( i don't know )) 

119.71 123.45 B: not enough money not you know they stuff like that 

123.33 128.86 A: yeah that's what they were referring to i think about striking for salary or benefits or something 

129.03 132.30 A: but these guys make millions before they're thirty it's 

129.07 130.03 B: yeah 

132.19 133.35 B: yeah i know 

132.58 136.51 A: ridiculous and we're killing ourselves in our normal jobs getting 

135.95 137.59 B: exactly 

136.81 138.11 A: not enough 

138.04 140.83 B: exactly and since they don't most of 'em don't even win 

141.06 146.62 B: so the best way of getting paid to go out and and play for a while and not lose or not win 

147.19 149.40 B: (( just doesn't seem like like )) 

148.29 154.42 A: or they sprain an ankle and sit on the bench for two months and get paid their ridiculous salaries anyway 

154.49 155.85 B: yeah exactly 

156.12 158.77 B: whereas we're down here making six bucks an hour 

156.37 157.12 A: (( [sigh] )) 

158.83 160.82 A: yeah what's your 

160.87 161.81 A: job 

162.26 165.09 B: i i actually work overnight at a target i 

165.23 167.17 A: uh-huh yeah 

166.24 167.90 B: work the um flow team 

168.58 169.53 A: you're what 

169.59 171.06 B: i work the flow team 

171.28 173.19 B: so i'm i'm stocker 

171.28 172.23 A: uh-huh 

173.07 180.05 A: okay yeah well i come in in the morning and expect the things to be on the shelves so i think your job is more important than the baseball team 

180.19 181.40 B: yeah well 

180.24 182.45 A: it affects me more directly 

182.61 185.79 B: yeah especially as i've gotta be up at three o'clock in the morning to go to work 

185.73 186.78 A: (( ugh )) 

186.32 187.12 B: so 

188.22 189.06 B: yeah 

188.35 189.39 A: yeah 

189.58 192.22 A: i'm a teacher we get paid 

192.30 194.39 A: not enough yeah 

192.64 194.81 B: really yeah well 

195.64 200.14 B: yeah i always hear about things about teachers and how they're not getting paid what they wanna get paid 

200.01 204.57 A: now we're having these huge budget cuts in minnesota and they're just cutting everything 

204.86 211.45 A: they said we can't even go to conferences unless we pay our uh-huh you have to go to these things to get 

205.40 206.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

207.29 208.68 B: that's ridiculous 

211.73 217.13 A: there are like these points you have to collect and when you want to renew your licence you have to have a certain number of them 

214.06 215.08 B: mhm 

217.36 220.53 A: and you don't get 'em unless you go to conferences and 

217.36 218.30 B: mhm 

219.94 220.70 B: right 

220.67 225.55 A: we don't wanna have to pay to go to the conferences ourselves but i guess we'll have to if we wanna go 

223.97 225.05 B: yeah 

225.75 231.95 B: yeah i think we should strike we should teachers should strike until baseball players pay for their conferences hm 

231.66 234.88 A: mm you're right well we almost went on strike this year 

234.92 249.19 A: the contract the new contract's supposed to start in september and they dragged it out and dragged it out until it was like i don't know january february before they finally settled and we were getting really close to striking this time 

249.96 252.32 B: right what are you a high school teacher 

252.39 253.85 A: well i teach adults 

254.00 258.84 A: english as a second language but it's through the state the the school district of the the town here

257.79 258.59 B: right 

259.55 260.40 B: right 

259.80 264.31 A: and we have our own special little page in the contract where we get paid less than everybody else 

264.27 265.69 B: (( oh that's ridiculous )) 

265.38 266.38 A: uh-huh 

266.53 269.41 A: we're working on that too but we're not getting anywhere 

269.50 270.88 B: yeah

459.10 461.65 B: i would pay more attention to the speed skating 

461.66 464.30 B: but it's you know it's not really professional in terms of you've got 

464.40 471.37 B: regular texas teams that like i used to compete with one and i would fall it out but i can't really do it anymore that is kinda depressing 'cause i don't skate anymore so
