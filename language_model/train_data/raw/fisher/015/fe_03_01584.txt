217.72 218.41 B: (( ah )) 

221.40 222.27 B: uh-huh 

223.25 234.28 B: uh it's just always the lines are always way longer to me now and they have to check your i._d. five times or whatever like you know when you first go in and when you get on the plane and when you're about to get on the plane and it's annoying 

226.10 227.47 A: yeah 

233.55 241.98 A: really yeah they didn't they didn't do all that like for me i mean i went like uh the christmas after nine eleven and like um 

240.95 241.75 B: uh-huh 

242.28 255.68 A: nothing really hap- 'cause i g- i got my tickets from online and i guess so i had like an electronic thing they didn't do they only checked my i._d. like as i was going through baggage claim and then when i was like giving my giving my ticket that was the only time they checked my i._d. 

247.37 248.22 B: uh-huh 

255.11 267.70 B: yeah i think it was like uh they're on ex- uh they got in trouble like a a few weeks earlier when i went i think like one of the times i went and flew somewhere and so they were [mn] like security nazis 

260.89 261.68 A: (( ah )) 

263.87 264.73 A: uh-huh 

267.33 268.45 A: oh really 

267.63 282.40 B: but i mean i guess it does [mn] i don't know so to get back on the subject i guess it lessens terrorism because they go through all that crap but i mean i i've i remember uh hearing something about how some guy got on the plane with a couple of knives it's like oh hey 

271.03 271.82 A: yeah 

275.91 276.69 A: uh-huh 

280.54 281.73 A: yeah 

282.21 283.98 A: (( yeah it's it's kinda scary )) 

282.50 285.71 B: so maybe they just get tired and i don't know 

284.80 289.18 A: yeah i guess it's kinda worth worth all the stuff the extra stuff that they do 

286.10 286.99 B: it's kinda 

289.14 290.39 B: yeah and 

291.02 294.40 B: just way longer on my time damn it [laughter]

307.16 308.41 B: and they um 

308.22 322.30 B: and i talked to some random girl in irving and she and we had to talk about how nine eleven affected us so i think we all these little survey things have to do with like terrorism and crap like that and nine eleven and uh the plight of it and how it affects us 

315.20 316.44 A: oh really 

317.24 318.68 A: (( oh okay )) 

320.81 322.09 A: (( oh all right )) 

322.21 331.95 A: oh i was talking to my sister she said something about like they they ask you about nine eleven and they'll ask you about like your opinion on like uh t._v. uh reality t._v. shows and stuff
