5.80 9.02 B: good my name is matt i'm from bellingham washington 

9.26 12.88 A: hi my name's greg i'm i'm actually from california 

12.96 13.82 B: (( okay )) 

15.20 15.99 A: um 

15.44 21.86 B: so [sigh] i guess the topic is ah what changes have we made in our lives since september eleventh 

22.50 26.88 A: yep i i i guess i have to say i haven't made any [laughter] 

26.97 30.68 A: i just kind of live my life as usual since september eleventh 

31.00 31.95 A: how about you 

32.35 40.51 B: yeah i would say that i haven't um made any substantial changes um but you know what's interesting is 

41.18 43.11 B: you know i'm 

43.61 53.97 B: i i i try to be conscious of you know of my upbringing and everything that ah comes into play as far as my opinions of you know 

54.13 56.71 B: you know the current events and everything 

57.16 58.39 B: (( and ah )) 

59.02 67.39 B: i have noticed that i've become more aware like i take a second look whenever i see um 

67.36 79.57 B: like someone that that looks like they're from an arabic background driving in a car you know um coming my way or something like that i i take like a second glance 

80.25 83.75 B: and i think that that's 

80.46 82.32 A: yeah i'd say i do that too 

84.20 92.95 B: you know i don't i don't know whether that could be considered racist or whatever but it's ah a generalization that i'm making subconsciously 

93.68 96.31 A: i'd i'd say i do the same things but i i don't 

96.75 98.33 A: i think it's more of just 

98.44 101.23 A: (( increased awareness i don't think it's racist )) 

101.33 103.10 B: yeah 

102.29 103.22 A: but i mean 

104.02 108.67 A: (( i mean it's kind of scary enough position where you don't have have another choice because of )) 

108.68 111.20 A: the the corporate world behind the terrorist attacks 

111.43 113.68 B: yeah yeah 

114.08 115.95 A: they've kind of made a bad name 

115.97 116.86 A: for their 

117.31 118.70 A: fellow comrades 

118.62 120.31 B: yeah 

119.93 123.27 A: although they didn't do it intentionally that's what that's happened 

123.51 125.25 B: mhm 

124.65 128.79 A: i think the only changes i've really made are the ones that are really out of my control 

128.84 141.22 A: such as like going to the airport and having free security and stuff like that but i think those things are good just just to make people responsible and ideally make you actually safer enough to feel safer 

132.50 133.67 B: yeah 

134.03 135.17 B: yeah 

142.30 150.51 B: yeah um [cough] yeah i wouldn't say that i've limited i mean i don't travel all that much anyway but i haven't limited my travel 

150.78 154.49 B: really um i'm willing to deal with the ah 

154.65 162.84 B: increased security you know at ah airports just i mean it's nice to know when you get on a plane that somebody doesn't have something in their shoes 

163.24 164.66 A: (( oh yeah definitely )) 

164.77 165.85 B: um 

165.94 167.82 A: that's more comforting that way 

168.63 169.84 B: i've um 

170.93 173.50 B: i'd say one change is that i've 

174.67 177.34 B: i mean prior to september eleventh i 

177.25 189.72 B: cared a little bit less about the news you know and and tried i try more to get a variety of sources of news now you know and i kind of seek out news more so than i did before 

190.55 200.39 A: i'd i'd say i do the same things but i've always been kind of interested in current events in the news so i i guess sometimes i get more glued to it but that's only because i think i have more free time 

200.42 202.18 B: mhm 

201.04 203.58 A: 'cause i'm not in school so i have more free time to 

203.93 205.34 A: watch the news and 

205.45 207.18 B: mhm 

205.86 211.04 A: keep up with what's going on in the world i find that local stuff any more just letters going on 

207.95 209.61 B: mhm 

211.06 212.76 B: mhm 

211.43 217.84 A: and i like to keep up with those things because you never know something some knowledge might come in handy for whatever reason 

217.87 219.58 B: yeah 

219.77 222.49 A: (( plus it's kind of fun just to know what's going on around here )) 

221.22 227.90 B: yeah oh yeah it's good to stay up on everything as best you can boy there's just so much information coming at you 

228.11 230.39 B: these days so it's hard to keep up with it 

231.11 233.38 B: um have you noticed 

233.91 238.73 B: one thing i've noticed and this is just in terms of like a change of attitude 

240.34 243.59 B: i've become much more suspicious of ah 

244.21 248.79 B: the intentions of our governing body 

248.80 256.68 B: you know i've just i've become much more hyper aware of okay now what are the reasons behind 

256.79 259.66 B: what these people are saying are the reasons 

260.10 265.81 B: um and you know i've always kind of been that way but i'm much more so over the last couple of years 

265.88 268.73 B: have you noticed a change like that 

268.23 270.57 A: (( oh yeah i've i'm actually always )) 

271.03 275.18 A: i mean not critical of everything that the government does but especially since 

275.47 280.22 A: bush became president i've been a lot more critical because i don't agree with anything he does 

280.25 281.19 B: yeah 

280.55 282.37 A: that's just my opinion i mean 

282.38 288.04 A: i mean you may be quite the opposite but but it sounds like you seem to have a similar point of view 

288.32 296.08 B: yeah i really don't i i have a hard time trusting um the intentions of the administration you know i mean i 

296.10 300.24 B: it appears that most of their decisions when if you dig deep enough 

300.28 302.60 B: are pretty self serving 

302.34 305.67 A: oh yeah i i fully agree with that mm i think that ah 

306.26 312.80 A: i think it's quite evident that bush is going into iraq for the oil i mean there's to me there's no question about that 

312.57 313.77 B: yeah 

313.15 320.89 A: because weapons of mass destruction were supposed to be the reason for the war we haven't found any of that and the war technically is kind of over 

321.04 322.21 B: yeah 

321.44 325.05 A: and we still haven't found any of that and now he wants to get the ah 

325.08 328.85 A: oil embargo lifted off of iraq so they can sell their oil 

328.52 330.51 B: yeah surprise surprise huh 

329.72 334.49 A: and wants it yeah and there'd be no other reason why he wants it off so soon 

334.47 335.74 B: yeah 

336.31 337.08 A: and 

336.39 338.93 B: yeah um 

337.58 342.84 A: so i don't know i don't think anyone can be trusted any more if you look at france and russia 

340.81 341.74 B: yeah 

342.88 347.38 A: they didn't want to go to war because they have interests in iraq it's not because they're against the war 

347.43 350.08 A: they they have things there that they're connected to 

350.18 357.14 A: like training military people are selling them things and other things they're not supposed to be doing that they didn't want to uncover 

357.24 359.91 B: right right right right 

360.72 361.93 B: yeah 

362.86 363.85 B: um 

364.62 365.76 B: (( well )) 

365.35 369.05 A: i just the governor of your state ran for president he seems pretty ah on 

369.11 370.54 A: top of things 

370.56 371.87 B: gary locke 

371.47 372.46 A: yeah 

372.66 374.47 B: yeah he um 

374.09 376.04 A: a good guy i've seen him on t._v. 

376.28 380.18 B: yeah i think that ah he's a reasonable man 

380.58 382.56 B: he ah seems to 

380.99 385.73 A: he seems to see things from every angle not not from a self motivated point of view 

385.76 387.72 B: yeah yeah he 

387.96 390.22 B: at the very least he studies 

390.24 396.46 B: a problem and you may not agree with his with his conclusion but [mn] 

396.71 404.05 B: i have faith that he has fully stated a problem and he has taken the path of you know least consequence 

404.41 411.87 B: um and sometimes those i mean that's why we have politicians to eh make the hard decisions you know 

411.67 412.80 A: mhm oh definitely 

412.15 413.31 B: (( and ah )) 

414.72 418.10 B: so yeah yeah he i would love to see him 

418.63 420.54 B: right run for higher office 

420.52 428.38 A: does does your state have any issues like california does with their governor though where they do some things that seem very suspicious 

428.90 429.77 A: (( i mean )) 

430.03 430.75 B: [noise] 

430.25 435.69 A: the governor of california is a democrat he's not a republican but i'd i'd say he is very similar to bush 

436.15 440.72 A: he does things that are very very self motivated and for his own his own interest 

436.23 437.09 B: (( mm )) 

440.85 448.09 B: the governor of california is grey davis right yeah yeah oh god and he was involved in that whole mess with um 

442.94 444.05 A: yep 

448.63 451.95 B: the power companies [laughter] 

450.57 455.14 A: oh yeah yeah he like profited from that too 

455.23 457.27 B: yeah um [cough] 

459.40 462.11 B: well right now i don't know 

462.16 465.94 B: of anything like that in my state but um 

467.71 474.30 B: he recently had to make a really tough choice i don't i guess we're kind of getting off topic here um 

474.54 480.66 A: [laughter] that happened last time i did one of these too just because there's only so much you can say about whether or not you've made a change since september eleventh 

481.49 483.48 A: i mean either you did or you didn't right 

483.21 485.29 B: yeah yeah 

484.30 486.93 A: and if you didn't there isn't much more to expand on 

486.82 495.19 B: yeah well he he made a controversial decision recently on a on a coal plant that um 

495.89 502.31 B: was going to go in in the fraser valley which is just east well it's kind of about 

502.86 511.59 B: oh a couple of hundred miles north east of ah seattle ah pretty much on the canadian border and there's a um 

511.67 522.15 B: we have some pretty serious power problems up here right now that are shutting down our aluminium plants and um they're looking for alternatives to hydro electric power 

522.02 529.77 B: being as you know the glaciers are melting and the the ah you know hydro can't always be depended on 

528.60 532.50 A: mhm that's a problem the snow remains all the time 

532.27 533.93 B: what's that 

533.14 536.04 A: that's a problem up there in that it rains and snows all the time 

535.46 549.13 B: even though the ah well we still have plentiful supply i think that they are just really looking to i'm i'm just giving the general argument that you know the masses are are saying you know that i think that if 

544.18 545.20 A: oh 

548.89 556.19 B: [noise] if conservation were put into place much more so then we wouldn't have any problems at all but you know 

556.23 557.31 B: um 

557.64 563.37 B: anyway there's there's this appearance of a power shortage coming up in the next five or ten years 

563.56 570.36 B: and ah not nearly like california you know but they're trying to look ahead a little bit and so there's argument for a coal 

570.38 582.73 B: ah coal plant basically ah to produce electricity um came forth and governor locke had to vote on it um and ah 

582.79 586.08 B: he ended up voting for it [noise] um 

585.99 598.22 B: which i disagreed with because it's going to put a lot of pollution in that valley um a lot of coal pollution um but he made a lot of other industries in the area um 

598.26 599.89 B: ah basically
