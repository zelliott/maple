0.00 1.63 A: hi this is mary 

1.19 4.59 B: hi this is anita [laughter] 

3.95 8.21 A: o- okay what's going on [laughter] we've got to talk about airport security huh 

5.59 6.41 B: [sigh] 

8.09 9.83 B: yeah 

9.26 11.58 A: okay what do you think about the airport security 

11.19 22.98 B: well since i've never flown i don't intend to fly [laughter] um guess it really doesn't make that much difference but um i think that'll make it a little bit tighter 

23.43 35.36 A: uh yes uh i know uh we we went to hawaii last year and uh i mean they my my sister's kids they made them take their shoes and they they checked in about two or three times they take their shoes and everything off 

33.36 34.31 B: oh my 

34.98 36.80 B: (( gosh )) 

36.00 36.90 A: uh-huh 

37.31 43.53 A: i got a boy who's handicapped they didn't make him take his shoes off he started taking his shoes off they said he didn't have to so that was kind of nice 

43.09 46.62 B: yeah they've got to make special 

47.14 48.24 B: (( you know )) 

48.29 50.42 B: stuff for people [sigh] 

49.87 53.54 A: well you know some people had a whole body search and other people didn't 

53.21 54.23 B: yeah 

53.93 57.42 A: so i mean they could they could take almost anything on you know on the plane 

57.62 62.59 B: i just sort of wish that they would do that kind of security in schools 

62.66 63.85 A: yes 

63.76 68.75 B: or restaurants or grocery stores [laughter] 

67.36 68.29 A: well 

68.32 76.26 A: well yeah but i mean schools especially because th- probably they probably take a lot of guns and knives and stuff like that to school on the bus and stuff like that and that's not right 

76.21 80.22 B: well i used to teach and um 

80.40 85.93 B: they had weapons on them um some of the girls would carry razors 

85.70 86.84 A: oh yeah 

86.29 92.77 B: i had them open one of my boxes one time with a razor out of her shoe [laughter] 

91.93 93.43 A: oh my god 

93.53 95.61 B: i had don't do that any more 

95.76 97.17 A: oh i kn- 

96.58 97.80 B: i quit 

98.02 108.77 A: well just like before the you know that nine one one incident they said they uh somebody they somebody said they saw something on the plane uh one of the planes they thought they we- they looked kind of funny 

108.83 112.37 A: you know kind of like they was uh but they never thought about any more about it 

112.23 113.26 B: yeah 

114.11 120.48 B: uh it's too spooky that's one reason i don't want to fly 'cause we're right over the flight pattern 

120.87 125.08 B: um the big jumbo jets go right over our house 

124.75 128.50 A: oh my son used to live down near charleston it was like that all the time oh 

127.94 136.36 B: and i can stand here and watch them and the whole time they're going over i'm going stay up stay up stay up [laughter] you know 

136.40 140.88 B: it just frightens me to think of those big old things falling 

140.74 141.85 A: yeah 

141.65 145.04 B: and i guess that's why i won't fly i just 

144.41 149.70 A: well i never flew either i'm i'm sixty five and i th- like that's the first time i've ever been in a plane 

149.67 154.06 B: now i'm fifty one and i don't feel like i'll i mean you know 

150.31 151.05 A: but 

154.59 158.44 B: i know there's more car crashes than airplane crashes 

157.46 160.78 A: that's what they said there's more accidents and more people getting killed on the road 

160.50 167.89 B: but the thing of it is if a plane crashes you're not going to step out and walk away 

168.16 173.31 B: (( um [laughter] you've got a better chance of survival i would think )) 

172.70 178.81 A: i don't know i said i was going to uh to nashville one day and by g- we a couple of weeks ago and a semi 

178.97 182.12 A: uh flipped over you know and flipped on top of a car 

182.07 182.74 B: (( [sigh] [mn] [mn] )) 

182.76 191.04 A: and that were traffic was held up for about four or five hours before they got it cleaned up they said there's a there's a car underneath of it and that's a sh- that's sad 

189.44 190.42 B: (( oh my god )) 

190.83 193.61 B: my husband drove the tractor and trailer 

193.56 195.37 A: oh that that's sad though 

194.46 196.24 B: he's gone now 

196.64 202.71 B: so i know he's he's killed three people but it was never his fault 

197.45 199.18 A: i mean it can happen any time 

200.38 201.17 A: (( oh my )) 

202.13 203.26 A: oh 

203.78 208.00 B: and that's i know that's hard to live with when you're the driver 

207.94 212.43 A: yes i mean like they say uh now an an eighteen wheel can't stop on a dime 

212.38 213.21 B: no 

213.53 216.31 B: those things are very hard to stop 

216.35 217.55 A: so i mean i 

216.67 220.15 B: especially when you've got forty five thousand pounds behind you 

219.98 234.52 A: yeah i know i we- i was a semi what makes me so mad when you're going down the road like that i mean uh you know th- it goes down to one lane or something like that they tell you to you know go down on one lane people don't go down they just keep right on going as far as they can get in it and then they expected to get in 

234.27 235.67 B: oh i know 

235.23 243.32 A: that makes me so mad but i don't know i i think the airport air- airport you know airport security is a lot better it could be sometimes i think it could be better but 

243.84 252.49 A: i don't think if if they sh- if they could carry- carrying on detectors maybe they should carry the pilots or the stew- stewardesses carry on detectors on the on the plane 

252.13 261.87 B: i think they ought to have some kind of weapons on the stewardess or once they shut that pilot cabin- uh door it can't open 

262.60 263.63 A: yeah 

263.05 264.12 B: (( you know )) 

264.87 265.67 A: well 

265.03 272.92 B: because well i don't think there'll really be anything like there was before because people aren't going to take that 

272.14 274.51 A: well people are aware right now 

274.47 282.98 B: well used to they'd say we're going to hijack the plane take it to cuba they'd um let the people off send the plane back 

282.70 283.95 A: yeah 

283.34 284.66 B: and but 

285.15 287.99 B: that other time they didn't [laughter] 

286.68 298.53 A: that was so sad then because they said some- uh what was it somebody got a cellphone in to call his mum says you know he was he was getting hijacked that he was going to get killed they won't see each other th- th- he won't see her any more 

294.58 296.14 B: mhm 

298.52 301.89 A: now that's sad they should've let the people off 

299.46 301.12 B: yeah i'd m- 

302.65 306.13 B: i don't think i'll ever get over that day anyway oh 

305.95 309.66 A: oh that was so sad though but you know it could happen any time 

309.46 310.76 B: (( i know )) 

310.61 315.69 A: y- i know my son he's in the uh reserves and he said he won't hang a yellow ribbon on his house 

315.78 317.05 B: really 

315.83 320.44 A: because he says he's afraid that they're going to terrorists are going to come and attack his house 

320.04 321.05 B: [sigh] 

320.86 327.25 A: he says a lot of places won- he's in nashville and he says a lot of places won't uh won't hang the ribbons out because they're afraid that's just like a 

327.37 333.19 A: a you know come on come on come on get me you know it's a th- that's just like an invite for the terrorist terrorists 

332.34 335.15 B: you know i never thought of that 

335.35 340.41 A: and i got the yellow ribbons but i i n- i didn't put one on my house yet i thought if anything 

335.58 336.42 B: (( god ))
