0.00 2.01 B: hi my name is roz 

1.13 4.78 A: hi i'm lisa how are you where are you 

2.68 3.59 B: hi 

4.44 7.07 B: i'm living in iowa and you 

6.73 8.25 A: i'm in philadelphia 

7.94 9.24 B: oh that's cool 

8.96 12.70 A: all right this is the second time i've gotten this topic and i know absolutely nothing about it 

12.04 13.26 B: oh really 

12.80 16.75 A: so if you know anything about please feel free to tell me [laughter] 

15.21 28.52 B: okay actually this is my first time except yesterday where i got a call where the other person hung up right away so i was um on hold for ten minutes but actually i don't honestly know a lot about it because i don't really follow major sports either 

20.50 21.94 A: (( oh no )) 

28.59 43.28 B: i mean i tend to think that you know ours is a culture that values sports a little bit too highly but [laughter] i can't really say i know that much about their grievances or anything like that 'cause i really don't follow sports news or anything like that 

42.73 47.23 A: yeah i [sigh] i keep hoping i get a different topic um [laughter] 

46.35 48.07 B: [laughter] 

47.36 50.28 A: i just don't know anything about this um 

49.56 53.27 B: yeah i seem to have a whole a very strong opinion i mean 

53.30 60.14 B: yeah it's hard to feel too much sympathy for 'em but i honestly don't know if i mean maybe they're justified i don't really know 

59.97 69.70 A: well that's essentially how i feel like i i don't know if they're justified or not but i have a hard time feeling sympathetic for someone who works you know one out of every three days and and makes millions of dollars 

69.87 71.07 B: yeah i mean 

70.14 71.03 A: um 

71.50 75.17 A: like i [mn] i just don't feel sympathetic for them you know what i mean 

71.67 72.92 B: yeah 

74.82 87.30 B: yeah i mean i tend to feel i mean along the same lines but i mean i can't really say i mean if it's just a pure we don't think we're making enough money thing i mean i tend tend to think well if you're really that successful 

87.34 93.99 B: i mean like the people at the bottom of the line yeah you know people who aren't getting all the endorsement contracts and all the 

93.93 106.87 B: other things that they get on the side just because of their fame i mean i have no idea what the regular joe at the bottom makes but the people who are against like you know salary caps and things like that of millions of dollars and i'm thinking you know 

107.11 113.95 B: the cities are that they still playing and they're funding these stadiums and everything like that but you know 

113.00 127.78 A: well that's the part that really gets me is why should the tax payers pay for the stadium if if these football teams and and baseball teams and basketball teams have enough money to pay employ- play players [mn] pay players millions of dollars you know 

114.81 116.31 B: yeah 

118.14 119.45 B: yeah i i 

126.58 128.47 B: yeah exactly i mean 

128.80 133.18 B: you'd think that the taxpayer should haven't to be able to pick up things like that i mean granted 

133.33 146.82 B: that you know they are going to be experiencing more business and things like that but for joe most taxpayers i mean it doesn't really matter that much to them and i mean maybe they enjoy the events but they're essentially a captive audience 

145.63 149.24 A: i'd take my tax money over [laughter] a football game any time 

147.51 158.86 B: yeah well i mean you know honestly like i live in iowa and you know we don't have any major sports teams or anything but we have just as many sports fans they enjoy things just as much and they don't have to pay for it [laughter] 

158.88 162.38 B: you know so they just watch on television i don't know 

159.95 160.83 A: (( mm )) 

162.34 163.57 A: yeah 

162.98 164.20 B: but mm 

163.69 166.67 A: well i mean part of uh part of the problem i have 

166.73 175.46 A: well part of the problem i have with this question is i don't know anything about sports but the other problem i have is i think that the salary cap thing is working incredibly differently in the different sports 

175.14 176.62 B: oh i see 

176.01 177.02 A: um 

177.10 181.50 A: like i know i know i know so very little about this in football 

179.91 181.07 B: [laughter] 

181.52 183.19 A: there are like 

183.89 197.03 A: i don't think they have salary caps per se i think what they have is that if you spend more than x amount of money on player salaries then you have to pay some like tax to the n._f._l. 

191.41 192.39 B: mhm 

196.94 198.00 B: oh okay 

197.65 201.08 A: and i think there are a couple of teams that do that because it's worth it to them 

201.97 211.20 A: um because they're you know the really really big teams um but most teams don't but then like in baseball it's just i think it's like a flat 

211.25 222.57 A: cap that you can't spend more than x amount of money uh the other thing i don't know is i know i remember reading way back when how much money the lowest played 

212.16 213.07 B: (( mm )) 

222.75 228.05 A: lowest paid player in baseball made and it was enormous it was huge 

227.40 232.71 B: yeah still i mean if you're in the major league then you're pretty much sitting on money anyway 

231.08 232.12 A: right 

232.61 237.33 A: but i'm not sure that's the same for other team other sports like football for example 

236.92 238.03 B: mhm 

237.39 246.56 A: like i'm not sure that the like eighth string quarterback for a football team makes anywhere near as much money as uh the guy who sits on the bench for you know 

246.68 248.14 A: the baseball team 

247.86 250.34 B: yeah i honestly can't say i mean 

250.38 262.88 B: you know one thing i have heard about a little bit is just how with the salary things and things like that that the smaller venues simply can't compete and it becomes a matter of well you have these really famous teams that are winning 

258.12 259.06 A: mhm 

262.73 268.23 B: and is it because they can afford better player 'cause they have more money to throw at it i mean is that really 

268.17 276.92 B: competition is that really fair i mean what's the point of playing a sport if essentially you know you're treating players like a commodity that you're purchasing 

276.76 283.27 B: and whoever purchases the best people wins i mean that se- i mean that seems really silly to me that 

279.75 281.30 A: yeah that's a good point 

283.11 292.37 B: you know well why should i care [laughter] you know i mean honestly if it's all a matter of just money and you know bringing in your investments and everything like that i mean 

293.18 295.24 B: (( i don't know i mean [sigh] )) 

294.25 305.69 A: no that's a good point i mean if the cowboys can buy the best players every single year and some little team i've never heard of can't afford to buy anyone then it's not really you're right it's not a competition 

305.68 307.12 B: exactly yeah 

306.19 308.94 A: you already know who's going to win you already know who's going to lose 

307.84 309.95 B: yeah well yeah i mean 

310.06 312.94 B: whoever has the most money tends to win and i mean 

313.04 321.34 B: which is you know i guess that's the moral of you know capital society in general but when it comes to something that's supposed to be competitive and it's supposed to be a game 

321.09 322.17 A: right 

321.37 324.13 B: when it seems like the game is loaded you're like well it's 

324.22 325.09 B: it's uh 

325.06 334.37 B: why why would you get that wrapped up in it because i'm i honestly think if i was a sports fan i would dislike that in that it's bad for the sport and if 

334.16 344.55 B: the really really famous people say well i can make more money going off and doing something else then well great we lose a few people that way but at least that way it has some semblance of fairness 

344.46 357.73 A: [noise] yeah i guess if you know now that i think about it that way and it's not something i had thought about before if i was really a fan it would really frustrate me if the best teams just bought the best people and no one else really ever had a chance to be the champions 

351.59 352.58 B: yeah 

356.71 358.43 B: yeah exactly i mean if 

358.46 359.67 B: if you just said no 

359.88 364.69 B: i don't know just bidding on these people and spending so much money on one or two individuals 

364.56 373.72 B: versus trying to get a good team together or you know even the worst buying people because they're more famous names and because they're gonna bring in more fans and things like that and it just 

371.37 376.47 A: (( right )) 

373.57 385.94 B: i mean it just seems so silly to me i mean you know on the one hand you know i tend to be very much in favor of workers rights i think that you know in general in most industries people should be able to strike and everything like that but 

385.82 400.46 B: when you're talking i mean it's just like you know if you know movie actors that were i mean not just the people who were being extras and you know scrambling to make a living but people who were making millions and millions of dollars a year were striking because of something you know i would just like i'd 

400.87 404.13 B: too bad for you [laughter] you know what i mean honestly 

403.72 415.79 A: yeah yeah well i guess you know i guess my feeling is like i would never tell 'em they can't strike um i certainly think they should have the right to but i mean in philadelphia for example we um we the philly's baseball team 

404.31 405.42 B: (( it's just )) 

408.59 409.40 B: mhm 

415.38 416.43 B: mhm 

415.80 426.68 A: and they're actually fairly good but the stands are empty they are empty and what it is is that the last time they went on strike people said we don't feel sympathetic for you we're not going to watch this anymore 

417.77 418.96 B: mhm 

420.18 421.35 B: yeah 

426.35 427.38 B: yeah 

426.74 436.48 A: and so i guess i would never say that they shouldn't be able to strike i mean certainly go for it i mean but i it seems to me like it's probably a pretty dumb thing to do 

431.27 432.46 B: mhm 

435.71 447.78 B: yeah i mean i don't know it seems like a lot of times that with with stuff like with strikes you just wanna slap 'em i mean it's like in the news on a slightly you know a little bit of a tangent i mean they have the american airlines thing where 

447.68 454.69 B: you know the pilots and the mechanics said you know they didn't weren't going to go on strike because you know our business is just going to founder 

454.53 466.03 B: and the you know the corporate people said basically you know if you guys don't accept our terms or these terms then we're gonna declare bankruptcy and everybody's gonna lose but then the stewardess' go and say 

463.79 464.66 A: (( mhm )) 

465.87 479.63 B: you know well too bad we're gonna vote that down and i'm just like that's the stupidest thing ever i mean honestly it's just you're just it's just self destructive which i guess is basically the thing with the baseball strike because if it gets that silly again where games get canceled i mean 

467.74 470.46 A: (( yeah )) 

480.11 482.92 B: the whole business loses [laughter] you know 

482.28 484.88 A: people will lose interest and they'll stop going 

484.73 487.51 B: yeah i mean it's not like baseball is the biggest 

487.42 490.36 B: sport in the world anymore anyway i mean 

490.25 501.25 B: fifty years ago it was much more important that it is now i mean now that you have you know basketball has increased in popularity so much more so has football and hockey now and 

498.33 500.24 A: oh yeah 

501.03 506.44 B: all those other things and you know you have e._s._p._n. e._s._p._n. two there's a zillion sports to watch now 

506.07 509.71 A: yeah my parents live in connecticut they have the all yankees all the time channel though 

509.10 513.26 B: oh really [laughter] oh my lord 

509.86 511.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

511.68 520.66 A: they play games and they play reruns of games and they like it's the they literally have the all yankees all the time channel like i i wonder if that's like a regional thing 

513.97 515.74 B: (( oh my god )) 

517.84 519.01 B: wow 

520.45 523.14 B: (( i i would hope so [laughter] )) 

522.33 528.64 A: but i mean like i wonder if you know if maybe you know around new york and boston is is something that 

527.17 529.74 B: yeah i can see that 

528.67 533.67 A: is still like it was fifty years ago but in other areas of the country nobody cares anymore or whatever 

533.28 539.38 B: yeah but you know honestly i mean i grew up actually in new jersey and we live real close to new york and it's like 

539.43 543.82 B: you know it's not the way it used to be where it was huge so i mean 

542.68 543.82 A: mhm 

543.61 555.86 B: baseball's still important to a certain extent but it's just i mean it's it's not like it couldn't be lost honestly and a lot of other other things you know just go by wayside as time goes on so i mean 

554.86 555.92 A: right 

556.05 561.32 B: you know and if honestly the players screw themselves then i guess they have nobody but themselves to blame but [sigh] 

561.49 573.81 B: i don't know i mean it's one of the things i don't really know enough about it and i could see probably that you know people in management are probably not always fair and but i i can't really say a whole lot more than [laughter] that i mean 

573.76 578.68 B: it's that's purely a subject which i have very little interest [laughter] and knowledge in 

577.18 586.81 A: i know and i've gotten this subject twice now and i'm like oh i don't know anything about this tell me something you know give a me a topic i can really like you know feel passionately about [laughter] 

585.39 598.34 B: yeah i was so disappointed 'cause 'cause yesterday's topic was going to be like nine eleven and i'm like oh that would have been so much better and then it was like oh no they just hung up on me i felt very rejected [laughter] 

592.32 593.21 A: oh 

596.47 597.42 A: (( no )) 

597.55 599.89 A: i'm sorry well you know 

598.46 599.95 B: (( well that's all right i mean ))
