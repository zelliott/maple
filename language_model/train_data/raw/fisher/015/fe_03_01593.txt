276.40 277.71 A: on friday 

277.29 278.29 B: mhm 

278.17 284.91 A: and i wasn't sure i even did the on line registration thing correctly given that i was multi frittering at the time when 

284.99 287.11 A: but when i looked at my caller i._d. 

287.42 289.42 A: when i got home on saturday 

289.45 292.50 A: i think they had already attempted seven calls 

292.75 293.99 A: (( i know i )) 

294.24 298.13 A: have a feeling the computer is off there saying i'm feckless and unreliable 

298.09 298.88 B: (( [laughter] wow [laughter] )) 

299.19 302.08 A: did you stay on topic with your other conversations

306.16 307.04 B: [laughter] 

311.00 316.96 A: yep the boyfriend is trying to embarrass me while i'm on the phone with you [laughter] 

318.22 319.76 A: (( um okay um )) 

321.63 330.14 A: i don't think they actually want to do voice recognition of a woman giggling [laughter] [noise] or any other kind of thing 

325.19 326.18 B: [laughter] 

329.91 330.55 B: (( [laughter] )) 

332.09 333.64 A: (( [laughter] um i )) 

335.22 337.32 A: also my brother in law 

337.28 338.07 B: mhm 

337.73 342.84 A: he's another one who they used to this is before being terribly concerned about terrorism 

342.96 346.14 A: they actually sliced open his brief case 

346.30 353.88 A: he had the look of a drug dealer about him apparently and he would get pulled over going through customs every time 

346.67 347.46 B: wow 

354.45 355.27 A: (( you know )) 

354.87 356.31 B: he had that look 

356.03 359.17 A: he had that look too much gold jewellery i think 

359.28 367.75 A: [laughter] but something he didn't believe in as a concept the thing that really got me though is that i actually did know somebody who was smuggling 

367.92 370.13 A: who never ever got stopped 

372.12 373.05 A: hey 

373.39 375.43 A: and he actually he's um 

375.74 380.83 A: he used to travel on business also and the handle of his brief case would come loose 

380.38 381.20 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

380.98 383.35 A: and if he had to go like to korea 

383.54 385.82 A: he would smuggle precious gems 

386.17 388.06 A: in the handle of his brief case 

387.63 389.28 B: (( mhm mhm in the handle )) 

389.03 394.71 A: yeah there's like a a leather wrap around the handle of the brief case does that make sense 

394.13 395.50 B: yeah 

394.84 395.65 A: yeah 

395.69 398.25 B: wow that's ingenious i guess 

397.80 408.99 A: hm sleazy is the word i prefer but probably 'cause i'm just not too keen on him as opposed to the propential- not potential potential drug dealer who's really quite a lovely guy 

409.46 411.32 B: hm i would assume so 

409.59 410.53 A: (( [mn] )) 

411.38 413.96 A: [laughter] 

414.16 420.56 A: like i'm going to try to get i'm trying to get back on topic i'm trying to think about all the security it makes me nervous 

420.68 424.14 A: what about the guns in the in the cockpit what do you think of that 

423.64 425.77 B: i think that's a great idea 

425.35 426.48 A: you do 

426.04 427.02 B: i mean 

427.09 430.49 B: if something terribly terrible does happen i mean 

430.92 431.91 B: (( they yeah )) 

431.06 433.22 A: they can defend themselves 

432.58 433.69 B: yeah 

433.98 437.76 B: i mean if worst comes to worst i mean they can land a plane safely 

434.06 435.13 A: do you worry 

437.48 438.55 A: mhm 

439.38 442.07 A: do you worry at all about um 

442.41 445.99 A: well like if one of those goes around the edge a little bit 

446.06 448.16 A: (( one of the [mn] pilots or )) 

446.15 446.98 B: (( ah )) 

449.17 451.43 A: something what if they have air rage 

451.85 452.66 B: um 

452.87 456.28 B: well not as much as 

456.39 459.68 B: potential passenger hijackers 

457.80 458.82 A: (( uh-huh )) 

459.75 463.28 A: uh i don't even like to think about it 

463.45 465.11 A: on the other hand [mn] 

466.07 468.24 A: do you think about terrorism in general 

468.55 470.17 B: (( um yeah i mean )) 

468.60 470.10 A: like with this war 

470.22 471.95 B: you hear it on t._v. often 

472.08 479.41 A: i don't watch t._v. so i think i stay immune to a lot of it but on the other hand i was working for the last couple of weeks in town 

479.44 481.98 A: and having to take mass transit 

482.19 488.41 A: and i felt like a sitting duck [laughter] in some places in a way that i never ever have before 

488.35 489.56 B: oh i don't take 

489.68 493.01 B: subways or anything but i do take buses sometimes 

492.61 493.63 A: uh-huh 

493.52 499.19 B: and i don't feel unsafe but you know it crosses my mind sometimes 

498.57 499.48 A: uh-huh 

500.36 504.87 A: see i just this is going right through the centre of boston and 

504.94 506.13 A: (( you know )) 

506.31 512.15 A: it gives me it was it felt like too good a target though you know i also have family in england 

512.40 513.71 A: and 

513.81 522.14 A: you know back when the i._r._a. was really active for a while it looked like they were gunning for cathy like they blew up um 

516.25 517.38 B: mhm 

522.38 525.22 A: a car right on the walk she took every morning 

524.82 525.70 B: mhm 

525.93 528.35 A: she missed it by like ten minutes 

528.41 529.09 B: (( wow )) 

528.61 532.33 A: they did something in harrods she had been there that day 

532.65 536.49 A: you know it's kind of like okay make yourself safe avoid her 

536.65 538.37 A: and you'll be okay 

539.01 539.61 A: (( ah )) 

540.80 544.06 A: so do you think you're going to get asked to do more than the three 

544.46 545.74 B: three phone calls 

545.31 546.50 A: yeah 

546.22 547.07 B: um 

547.35 548.48 B: i guess 

548.91 553.47 B: we're only getting paid for three but i guess i'll take a fourth call 

551.08 552.20 A: mhm 

553.91 557.37 A: they said that some people might be asked to do like twenty five 

556.87 557.96 B: twenty five 

557.60 561.63 A: yeah i figure that they're not looking for 

561.67 562.52 A: (( you know )) 

563.31 564.39 A: more 

564.65 565.46 A: (( um ))

571.17 574.44 A: completely warped background [laughter] 

573.59 574.63 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

574.66 578.16 A: [laughter] we are generally probably the easy ones to get 

578.25 579.63 A: (( but um )) 

580.72 581.69 A: (( you know )) 

582.24 585.38 A: it's a friend of mine's company i guess who's involved in this 

585.81 587.59 A: (( that's how i heard about )) 

589.88 592.98 A: it the boyfriend is almost kind of behaving 

593.03 596.84 A: he's not having a jealous fit about our being on the phone and 

597.05 599.95 A: that's a kind of progress i think is anybody in the back
