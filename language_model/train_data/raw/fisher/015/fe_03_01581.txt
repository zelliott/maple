0.58 2.14 B: [noise] mary lewis 

2.02 4.05 A: hi i'm maryanne woodville 

7.75 8.56 A: hello 

8.30 9.28 B: yes 

8.88 9.82 A: oh hi 

10.90 15.76 A: ah what was the topic on uh i think it said about uh airport security 

15.20 17.82 B: [sigh] does it uh decrease 

17.93 19.32 B: (( terrorist )) 

19.82 23.94 A: um you go ahead and begin i d- i don't know what to say [laughter] 

23.50 25.02 B: [sigh] i think it does 

24.93 25.98 A: it does 

25.15 26.61 B: to an extent 

26.35 29.25 A: yes uh i think so too 

30.18 31.67 A: um 

31.71 38.45 B: of course it's kinda scary that they had some go through airport security [lipsmack] and 

31.79 32.66 A: what else 

38.83 43.25 B: i'm thinking specifically some ago time ago about some guy with 

43.42 46.44 B: rubber soled shoes or something there was something in his shoe 

46.67 47.48 A: mhm 

48.11 57.54 A: and um you know how how you know how security is real bad right now and um i think they just they should have more um 

57.77 59.27 A: uh like 

59.40 60.85 A: uh what do you call those 

61.42 62.86 A: like p- you know 

63.47 70.21 A: more like police on on uh you know airplanes airlines you know because of all the terrorism going on 

64.96 66.78 B: [lipsmack] oh yeah the people 

69.82 70.81 B: mhm 

70.52 71.92 A: and um 

72.00 75.50 A: um [lipsmack] i think that it should be more protected you know 

76.08 80.26 A: since you know there's so many s- hijackings on our airplanes and 

79.50 83.32 B: [sigh] as long as they are there uh discreetly 

83.40 84.34 A: yes 

83.70 91.27 B: [lipsmack] uh and i say that because recently i took a flight a few months ago and i was standing in line 

91.34 97.62 B: and some guy came around and was gonna board the plane and they told him he had to the other side where 

97.64 102.34 B: they were checking people [lipsmack] and the lady said oh he's security 

99.03 100.48 A: [noise] oh really 

102.65 103.61 B: he's with 

102.66 103.82 A: oh 

103.62 108.43 B: i forgot what it was and i thought now that's real secure everybody knows who he is now 

104.89 105.70 A: uh-huh 

108.64 113.72 A: oh really [laughter] that's good kinda strange isn't it 

109.41 112.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

112.75 121.38 B: yeah so i i don't think that's the kind of security i'm thinking of [laughter] i thought you know that's the first one they're going after [laughter] 

115.99 117.66 A: no uh-uh 

118.19 119.80 A: (( i mean i don't know i would )) 

120.12 130.40 A: really i would feel more safe if i were in a airplane like going on the flight i'd feel more s- more safe and security if they had uh uh airplane security you know 

130.85 131.80 A: uh 

130.86 137.00 B: but don't advertise who they are [laughter] yeah you know let 'em wonder 

132.95 136.03 A: yeah that's true [laughter] 

136.78 139.08 A: [laughter] really 

137.92 147.12 B: [laughter] now i do think that all the uh security has slowed down the check in time and such that and they don't tell ya a lot of it in advance 

143.03 144.00 A: mhm 

147.07 147.93 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

147.22 153.13 B: because that particular flight what i did was i went i traveled from houston inter continental 

149.25 150.05 A: uh-huh 

153.03 153.92 A: uh-huh 

153.25 158.20 B: and i i allowed for a lot of extra time when i went through the gate 

156.22 157.01 A: uh-huh 

157.92 158.75 A: uh-huh 

158.24 160.16 B: the alarm went of course 

160.28 163.49 B: and i got through [sigh] and it was my shoes 

163.58 164.45 A: uh-huh 

164.09 167.09 B: and i so whenever i flew back 

167.28 170.45 B: uh i automatically took my shoes off before i went through the 

170.57 171.81 A: oh 

170.66 184.62 B: security thing and i think they oughta you know post little things like that that would help people to get through quicker because if i'd known to take my shoes i'd have put 'em in the little basket [mn] sent 'em through and it wouldn't have held me up [laughter] 

179.84 180.65 A: mhm 

183.54 185.72 A: really [laughter] 

185.54 188.62 B: you know so little things like that could help to speed it up too 

188.25 192.97 A: [mn] have you ever been in an airplane i mean i k- i for one have never been on one so and 

190.78 191.34 B: (( [mn] )) 

192.44 195.00 B: oh yes yes several times 

193.20 197.82 A: and i if i ever go one on it'll be my first time you know 

197.95 202.82 A: i don't know i've just never been [laughter] i've just never had the chance to to go on a flight you know for anywhere 

201.71 207.46 B: [sigh] well this the last flight i took was uh for thanksgiving and it was um 

208.43 210.53 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] american airlines 

209.90 210.77 A: uh-huh 

211.41 214.96 B: and before that i've always flown south west or continental 

211.67 212.75 A: (( oh )) 

214.58 215.47 A: uh-huh 

215.66 218.21 B: and i haven't flown either one of those 

216.13 216.96 A: and 

218.90 227.33 B: in over a year i don't fly a lot but um that's the only security that you know i've experienced lately so i don't know how the other ones are 

220.08 220.95 A: uh-huh 

221.57 222.42 A: uh-huh 

226.90 233.40 A: and what do you think about uh uh they're saying like pilots should have be armed with guns do you agree on that 

231.21 236.90 B: [sigh] i don't think that's a good idea because what's the first thing that a terrorist is gonna do 

236.71 237.71 A: (( yeah )) 

236.93 240.21 B: he's gonna take the gun away from the pilot so that just gives him another gun 

238.68 239.95 A: mhm 

240.21 241.54 A: yeah that's true 

241.07 245.68 B: [sigh] i think maybe you know uh a stun gun or something like that might be okay 

245.19 257.02 A: yeah or or a you know a gun with blanks or something i don't know that that's gonna do any good but [sigh] i don't know [laughter] to me i i don't know it has it it has it's advantages and disadvantages you know 

252.18 253.21 B: [laughter] 

256.57 259.18 B: that's true that's very true 

257.55 261.96 A: so it's hard to say you know which you know which way to go by 

262.15 265.13 A: you know if they should go for it or not you know 

265.41 269.08 B: yeah it takes somebody a lot smarter than me to make those decisions 

267.93 268.93 A: yes 

269.19 275.64 A: i guess i won't never know 'cause i probably won't ever go on a flight [laughter] but i you know i you know there's some people that travel a lot so 

271.98 273.24 B: [laughter] because 

273.79 274.87 B: yeah 

275.65 280.50 A: for their their jobs and and go to you know here and there and so 

279.92 287.90 B: that's true where i work the people travel extensively for their jobs and and none of them seem to be worried about it though 

283.14 284.09 A: uh-huh 

284.16 285.90 A: yeah 

287.55 288.96 A: yeah 

288.31 290.67 B: and i don't know if that's a good sign or a bad sign 

289.79 294.17 A: i guess it just depends on the person you know they're either when they go for it or not so 

293.07 295.19 B: mhm mhm 

295.13 296.32 A: where you from 

295.98 297.42 B: [sigh] texas 

297.19 301.32 A: texas oh okay i'm here i i live in austin where do you live at 

300.69 301.70 B: houston 

301.43 305.12 A: houston oh okay yeah i live in here in austin texas 

302.37 303.68 B: yeah 

304.67 310.69 B: and they have i do know one of the things they've done here i don't know about everyplace else but they have started having 

310.88 314.89 B: um vehicle checks on the way to the airport 

313.15 313.96 A: uh-huh 

314.53 316.48 A: oh really oh 

315.53 317.50 B: [lipsmack] yeah and 

316.49 319.59 A: i don't they probably do it here too i i really don't know 

319.19 326.17 B: [sigh] and i wondered about that because i'm sure that you know it it does help some but a lot of people 

324.90 331.54 A: well it does it does help too because you know you don't know if you know uh terrorist going through the airports 

329.12 333.22 B: [mn] yeah but you have to open your trunk and everything yeah 

331.86 337.13 A: yeah i mean you don't know if you know because of all this uh high security checking on this 

336.30 337.28 B: mhm 

337.20 341.84 A: and uh because of terrorism and all this and i mean that's why they're doing it 

341.92 346.31 A: and then to see if if there's terrorists back into the airports and all that so 

346.37 353.41 A: i mean in a way i- it's good that's they're doing it in a way it's not you know because it does invade privacy too at the same time you know 

349.82 350.79 B: yeah they 

352.49 357.63 B: they also have random checks they did that both both times i was flying 

354.96 356.04 A: oh they do 

357.34 358.22 A: uh-huh 

357.64 358.73 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

358.89 370.02 B: and i don't know if it's like every fifth person or what but they'll pull somebody out and they'll look in their suitca- or their carry on bags and they'll check their shoes and everything 

362.21 363.31 A: (( oh really )) 

366.57 367.39 A: uh-huh 

370.12 374.40 B: and it was kind of strange because there was no 

375.04 375.99 B: [lipsmack] 

376.79 380.28 B: no way to tell what kinda people they were pulling out 

377.54 378.69 A: mhm 

379.84 380.91 A: yeah 

380.42 384.80 B: i mean like most of them that i saw were like grandmothers [laughter] 

383.73 391.02 A: oh really and so people get offended they get real offended by stuff like that you know they think that they're invading their privacy or you know 

388.18 389.10 B: and that's 

390.43 394.89 B: that's the reason that i think it's you know every certain number 

394.59 395.56 A: uh-huh 

394.94 401.06 B: because whenever i landed in um oh i can't remember where i saint louis i think is where i 

401.04 401.78 A: (( mhm oh )) 

401.30 402.83 B: had to change planes 

402.87 408.86 B: uh and they called the the flight was delayed for a lot of reasons and then when they finally did call for the flight 

408.81 409.62 A: (( really mhm )) 

408.91 416.51 B: a lady and i stood up at the same time and she said oh go ahead and so i got in line in front of her well they pulled her out [laughter] 

416.13 418.11 A: (( oh no )) 

417.31 419.78 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

418.58 425.91 A: that's embarrassing i mean i i she probably was embarrassed i i know i would've if it would've been me [laughter] 

424.05 428.77 B: i think i think it's just you know a random number that they they pull out every 

427.38 428.28 A: uh-huh 

428.81 432.57 A: certain person every so and so person yeah 

429.95 431.04 B: yeah 

431.67 432.65 B: mhm 

432.61 434.92 A: (( but it is kinda embarrassing yeah )) 

434.57 440.13 B: [sigh] yeah and the problem is it delays it too because you have to s- get out of line 

439.82 440.89 A: mhm 

440.29 444.77 B: you have to let them go through all your stuff and you know they take a little wand and everything 

444.67 445.52 A: mhm 

444.94 445.98 B: and 

446.06 449.89 B: you know if you're on a flight that you don't have reserved seats 

449.85 450.79 A: mhm 

450.79 457.86 B: like that's the way south west is for one thing yeah then you're one of the last ones to board and you have to sit whatever's left over 

451.37 453.72 A: and that's a last minute thing yeah 

457.72 458.72 A: yes 

459.25 462.25 B: and so you know that's an inconvenience 

459.36 461.24 A: you can m- yeah 

461.74 463.92 A: yeah it is i know what you mean 

463.39 467.32 B: and i realize you know they're doing it for security reasons and everything so 

466.21 467.58 A: yeah 

467.57 469.92 B: i try and say okay you know don't 

470.16 474.51 B: don't worry about it but i know there are some people that very irritated too 

471.31 472.60 A: mhm 

474.06 478.03 A: i know and as like i say it has its advantages and disadvantages 

477.33 478.37 B: mhm 

478.16 480.52 A: um uh bunch of stuff like this huh 

480.40 487.30 B: [lipsmack] and i guess everything that they do like that though to increase security we should we should just accept and and not 

482.86 484.20 A: mhm 

484.96 485.90 A: yes 

487.31 490.16 B: get irritated with because it's for our own safety 

489.29 493.56 A: i mean it's they really doing it for our own good too for our safety so 

492.73 493.89 B: right 

493.71 494.78 A: you know 

494.98 498.43 A: some people are i don't know so if you just can't please everybody you know 

498.04 498.97 B: that's true 

498.75 501.10 A: they it's gonna happen to them you know 

501.13 503.51 A: it's people gonna get irritated and mad so 

501.23 502.35 B: i do know 

502.98 510.12 B: one of the guys i work with told me that h- every time he goes through an airport they [laughter] they give him that yeah 

507.57 511.52 A: he gets checked oh he gets checked oh [laughter] 

510.62 513.50 B: and he was very verbal about it one time 

513.19 514.06 A: uh-huh 

513.79 521.17 B: and he said then when he got on the plane he looked round all around him is airport security people [laughter] sitting on the plane 

515.86 516.66 A: uh-huh 

519.15 520.35 A: really 

520.99 522.36 A: (( oh no )) 

521.98 524.38 B: i told him i said they've got you red flagged 

524.19 528.04 A: [laughter] that's weird 

525.38 530.48 B: [laughter] and and he was the kind that you know it was inconvenient because 

530.90 535.48 B: it threw him later getting on the plane and he didn't like to have to travel anyway 

535.42 536.18 A: mhm 

535.62 543.63 B: um you know so he he was very verbal with it but i don't know if he's calmed down some or not [laughter] 

539.73 540.59 A: uh-huh 

542.55 544.29 A: oh [laughter] 

544.35 555.30 B: but you know also and it's right around the time he told me about that he told me he goes to louisiana a lot and he told me that they'd had a shooting in the airport 

551.59 552.29 A: (( mm )) 

555.05 556.21 A: really 

555.92 563.22 B: over there yeah and it was right after i had been over there and i told him i said well i'm certainly glad i didn't know about that before i went 

557.49 558.48 A: (( oh mm )) 

563.26 568.54 B: and i don't i don't how the security you know affects something like that 

568.27 569.22 A: mhm 

569.24 570.73 A: (( [lipsmack] golly )) 

570.71 571.70 B: um 

571.95 576.30 B: i know that they've changed they have changed things here a lot where 

576.44 578.62 B: uh they don't allow you to go 

578.66 580.27 B: past the gate 

579.89 580.79 A: mhm 

580.50 582.95 B: uh the security gates there 

582.81 583.70 A: mhm 

583.91 585.92 B: uh unless you have a ticket 

585.90 589.65 A: really i'm pretty sure they doing that here too in here in austin 

586.61 587.67 B: and i'm 

589.37 595.63 B: yeah and i'm sure that has that has helped some as well you know because 

593.01 593.90 A: mhm 

594.06 595.11 A: mhm 

595.66 599.89 B: a lot of people could go through just pretending to see somebody off or someth-
