196.55 210.87 B: with muslim religion or what the terrorists originally said with bin laden saying that he didn't like that idea of the u._s. people occupying saudi arabia so that's

271.81 274.41 B: that i would hope give hope 

274.78 280.14 B: and in watching all of the news casts about nine eleven 

280.25 283.05 B: it did make me more and more depressed 

283.07 293.67 B: but it was it was a shock it was such a shock thing i couldn't not turn the t._v. off and i couldn't stand to watch it

320.01 328.30 A: you know it was like what did i do i brought my daughter into this word and [cough] now we're because in my mind i though we were going to go to war 

328.41 331.01 A: for sure you know that day 

331.29 334.01 A: so i was just you know i was terrified

338.72 342.93 A: i i feel that um my my country is protecting me 

343.31 345.62 A: and i have faith in it so [mn] 

345.31 348.02 B: well i really appreciate 

348.47 353.30 B: the fact that our leadership has 

353.75 362.59 B: has been as adamant about saying we're just aren't going to allow this sort of thing 

362.49 363.46 A: yeah 

363.08 366.13 B: and even though they have not 

366.25 367.32 B: um

372.88 374.86 B: um they you know 

374.99 380.62 B: put the quahedis on his ability to continue and do more 

380.98 390.39 B: but ah the cells of people who are the offshoots of and little individual cells of terrorists

392.80 396.42 B: and they are still existing and 

394.08 395.41 A: (( [noise] yeah [cough] [cough] [cough] [mn] [noise] )) 

396.49 405.31 B: i was not really aware that it was as easy for them to exist in this country as it seems to have been 

405.62 410.03 B: and i just really applaud everyone whose 

410.09 414.57 B: perking up their ears and providing information for 

414.64 418.24 B: fire departments and police departments an- 

418.37 421.84 B: and information for people it's just

541.31 543.27 B: [noise] [noise] it was just a hoax 

543.92 546.30 A: yeah [mn] most likely
