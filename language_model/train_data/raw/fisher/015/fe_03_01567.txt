56.21 57.79 A: gosh they're 

58.11 62.76 A: you know they're just playing a game for a living and they make all this and they want more but 

63.11 68.48 A: the only way to stop 'em from making more is to just not go to the games and not watch 'em

80.48 86.01 B: you know it's like just basketball or quit this team and go over here so they can 

86.80 88.99 B: we [mn] like the spurs 

89.51 92.49 B: where we had the we had the spurs in san atone 

89.68 90.87 A: mm yeah 

92.01 93.27 A: mhm 

92.55 99.96 B: well i'm just a little suburb off san atone so you could say we're spurs fans 'cause that's our hometown basketball team 

97.21 98.09 A: okay 

100.04 101.49 B: and i know 

101.74 110.27 B: they get paid an awful lot and then on top of that they built a new dome for 'em to play in 

109.79 110.77 A: mhm 

110.44 123.58 B: and the other dome is just sitting there so i mean that's all our taxpayers' money you know so that's something we paid for and you're right as long as the taxpayers lets them get along w- 

117.37 119.33 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

123.85 125.82 B: away with it they'll do it 

125.07 126.01 A: yeah 

126.27 128.03 B: but i 

127.15 130.59 A: yeah we we have a similar situation in in seattle 

130.54 131.68 B: yeah 

130.75 137.96 A: um a few years ago we blew up the king dome which wasn't even paid for yet it was only twenty five years old 

137.72 138.65 B: oh 

138.45 148.64 A: and it hadn't even been paid for yet and they decided to blow it up and replace it with safeco field which is a ball th- the mariners' baseball field 

147.91 149.05 B: mhm 

148.68 156.52 A: and then paul allen of microsoft went and got the taxpayers to help him build a field just for the seattle seahawks football 

156.11 157.19 B: oh 

156.94 166.31 A: they're right next door to each other [laughter] and it's coming out of us the state tax figures mhm [laughter] 

158.63 159.63 B: oh 

164.00 168.83 B: right right right and there again you know um i think 

169.17 172.40 B: i'm a little person and so i you know 

172.71 176.35 B: whatever my suggestion is i'm probably not going to 

176.72 179.24 B: it's not going to carry much weight but i 

180.04 185.59 B: i think they should've stayed in the old dome you know like here instead of blowing the other one you know 'cause 

185.57 198.90 B: this one we've got it's the one that they didn't blow it up they're just they're just hoping we'll have concerts and things like that to come to it but so far guess what this year they've got three events so it's just sitting there empty 

198.54 205.89 A: no kidding so it's a big money loser and the taxpayers have to pay for the upkeep even though it's not bringing in revenue 

199.54 200.50 B: mhm 

205.68 206.72 B: (( right )) 

206.71 208.87 A: perfect perfect huh 

206.88 210.94 B: you're right you're right that's that's exactly how it is 

210.36 219.26 A: [sigh] it's it's amazing how um people can be and i gue- i shouldn't say swindled because i don't think there's really any swindling but 

219.37 220.46 A: (( um you )) 

220.24 222.94 B: hook line and sinker [laughter] 

220.48 221.32 A: (( know )) 

221.61 223.97 A: [laughter] well they're willing to 

224.17 227.52 A: pay for the new field pay for the upkeep 

227.69 229.49 A: yeah through the taxes 

229.05 230.16 B: right 

229.51 235.19 A: and pay the ticket price pay the concession price pay the souvenir price 

231.82 232.48 B: right 

234.58 235.42 B: right 

235.47 236.74 A: and uh 

236.44 238.85 B: and the souvenirs aren't cheap either 

238.25 239.03 A: [laughter] 

239.12 240.49 B: [laughter] you know 

239.88 241.36 A: isn't that awful

244.68 246.71 B: and now they're gonna get their uh 

246.93 254.11 B: they're trying to get the cowboys here to san atone for their practice down here you know for the next four years and 

253.24 254.79 A: (( mm )) 

254.22 254.91 B: (( phew )) 

255.11 263.32 B: and th- the cowboys are saying no 'cause the city don't wanna give 'em as much money as they want like they need it right i don't think so 

262.28 264.98 A: [laughter] 

263.47 265.97 B: let 'em go someplace else who cares 

265.47 273.17 A: what are they gonna make the city pay 'em to practice there is is that it instead of them paying to use the c- the city 

269.65 270.62 B: um 

272.38 280.74 B: i something like that they- they're trying to come to a bargaining gre- agreement i guess and they're they're fussing over it and 

279.95 282.02 A: isn't that amazing 

281.37 287.39 B: yes you know um and they're losers anyway they never win anymore [laughter] you know 

285.45 289.26 A: [laughter] i know neither do our teams up here 

288.47 289.86 B: (( you know so )) 

290.04 291.31 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

290.16 299.19 B: well the spurs lost tonight by one point one point i don't even know who they were playing but my daughter was in there screaming one point you lost by one 

299.09 300.65 A: [laughter] 

299.25 300.00 B: (( point )) 

300.07 305.50 B: (( you're supposed to go to the playoffs how are you gonna go to the playoffs like they hear her you know i'm not into sports but )) 

303.63 304.58 A: oh

305.53 307.72 B: she's into basketball and football 

308.54 313.46 A: [lipsmack] it's it's it's funny you know when you get that that team spirit 

313.23 314.91 B: right right 

314.52 324.89 A: money goes [laughter] out the window unfortunately i i guess it's better than you know maybe drugs or something [laughter] yeah but 

316.12 317.14 B: yes 

317.21 318.37 B: mhm 

320.56 323.39 B: yeah it's a form of entertainment i suppose 

323.81 325.98 B: yes yes yes yes 

324.90 327.97 A: it is it's wildly expensive 

326.69 329.37 B: well i haven't never done this this is my first survey 

329.12 332.52 A: oh really uh this is my third phone call 

329.96 330.96 B: yes 

332.29 333.15 B: (( hm )) 

332.77 339.64 A: and and it's funny usually when the phone rings i pick it up and i think it's telemarketer 'cause there's a little bit of a delay 

339.89 340.91 B: oh 

340.29 346.38 A: but if you just if you just pick it up and you say hello and then just wait two three seconds 

346.17 347.36 B: oh okay 

346.66 351.85 A: it'll it'll tell you hi we're we've got a call for you if you're willing to take it press one 

351.55 364.54 B: oh okay that's cool well i called they've they've called my cell phone but i changed that time and i put in i made the call this time just to see how it would go 

352.54 354.66 A: and um and if 

358.71 359.55 A: mm 

364.51 371.50 A: mm well i'm glad you did [laughter] i figure um a buck a minute to chit chat is um 

364.94 366.13 B: so it's first time i've 

366.19 367.42 B: yeah mhm 

371.18 372.68 B: very reasonable 

372.26 384.36 A: yeah yeah [laughter] i can't i can't complain and even if i never did get paid i'd think well you're really not out anything i've had very pleasant conversations each time 

372.94 375.63 B: yeah yeah not bad 

376.43 377.33 B: no 

380.19 381.18 B: no 

383.77 386.13 B: right you can meet some very nice people 

385.72 389.43 A: (( yeah yeah and it's just [laughter] i don't know it's something different to do )) 

389.27 393.69 B: but on sports you know i'm just not a real hip hopper on sports so 

391.94 395.49 A: [laughter] 

393.91 401.53 B: you know um it's quite different but i don't think they should make any more money i think they make enough 

401.33 402.16 A: yeah 

402.65 410.27 A: i i think in matters of strikes it kinda chea- when they go on strike for money like that it kinda cheapens the 

410.23 421.39 A: reason that we have unions and barg- bargaining units you know usually unions are fighting for health care or better hours or something r- 

412.27 413.20 B: right 

414.66 415.46 B: right 

418.67 419.75 B: right 

420.41 422.26 B: or benefits yeah 

421.53 423.35 A: really important 

423.04 424.58 B: right matters 

424.23 431.98 A: and so i think it really gives the the union workers kind of a bad rap and and that's unfortunate 

429.42 430.68 B: yeah 

431.78 434.69 B: oh that's true that's very true 

433.26 434.28 A: um 

434.49 435.55 A: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

435.93 439.65 A: (( um other than that boy those guys )) 

439.66 440.78 B: (( right right )) 

440.83 448.74 A: [sigh] well at least at least hopefully they're sinking their money back into the american economy with all that they're making [laughter] i guess we could 

446.60 447.48 B: right 

447.98 459.97 B: well we have one basketball player that i'll have to say here in san atone that um one side of town is is it's not a very good side of town and he's built community centers for the children 

459.96 465.36 B: and he's really soaked a lot of his money in to helping children here 

463.19 464.65 A: oh 

465.49 467.38 A: isn't that wonderful 

466.55 481.11 B: mhm now now something like that i would go for you know if i if i saw if each and every one of 'em would donate so much of their money to something like that you know or to some kind of charity fund that we knew it was going to like breast cancer or 

469.84 470.76 A: mhm 

481.18 488.96 B: or something like that you know but this guy he's got a community center just for children and he just keeps putting more and more money into it and 

488.86 490.30 A: oh 

489.19 491.65 B: you know it it's pretty good 

490.96 494.72 A: good for him that's that's really nice 

491.85 492.87 B: yeah 

494.11 495.35 B: mhm 

495.13 496.37 A: so he 

495.47 498.21 B: and he's gonna retire next year but um 

498.15 499.04 A: (( mm )) 

498.63 504.74 B: he- he's done a lot for the community you know on the east side because it's kinda a bad part of town and 

504.95 513.71 B: poor side of town in san atone and he um he's doing a lot for the kids over there 'cause he knows that they don't have the opportunities that other children have 

513.58 518.56 A: now that's great when you are you're a role model in your town and you 

514.73 515.69 B: yeah 

518.47 519.44 B: yeah 

518.70 521.48 A: take your resources and do something like that 

520.63 527.57 B: yeah because he makes millions of dollars you know and he it's probably a big tax write off for him anyway but at the same time he's 

527.63 533.49 B: he's using it for a good purpose you know i mean instead of the lap of luxury and 

530.27 531.36 A: mhm 

533.61 542.45 B: he he probably had the lap of luxury but he still has everything else you know i mean that he's doing for his community so i i think if i could see 

539.96 541.04 A: mhm 

542.71 552.35 B: a lot of athletes doing that but i don't see a lot of athletes doing that you know i would and i would say you know the money they make is is okay but 

547.80 548.63 A: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

552.50 554.24 B: right now they make enough 

554.07 559.43 A: i think with a lot of athletes the money's going toward child support and bad investments [laughter] 

559.25 564.34 B: yeah right or you seem 'em getting busted on t._v. for drugs and 

559.85 561.44 A: unfortunately 

564.21 572.99 A: oh uh in portland oregon the the trailblazers have had a horrible problem with that their team is falling apart 

572.45 573.80 B: really 

573.08 577.09 A: dr- with drugs and crime and it's so embarrassing 

574.73 575.89 B: yeah 

576.56 579.45 B: [noise] yeah i bet it is i bet it is 

578.01 592.73 A: yeah 'cause they're pretty popular up here they're another one of they're paul allen's team also paul allen who formed microsoft with bill gates he owns the trailblazers so he really he needs to he needs to do something about that 

585.93 587.30 B: (( oh wonderful )) 

587.82 589.14 B: oh really no 

592.93 594.71 B: oh i didn't know that didn't know that oh 

594.08 595.30 A: yeah 

595.68 597.10 A: he owns everything 

597.86 599.89 A: (( [laughter] that's all right )) 

598.66 599.95 B: got a gateway i gotta
