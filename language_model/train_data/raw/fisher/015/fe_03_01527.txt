15.61 18.72 B: got i don't know what you think ah 

19.26 23.23 B: i think it's kind of getting out of hand every now and then when they do strike though

27.65 28.74 A: um 

28.93 30.39 A: i mean the

35.69 36.29 A: (( a )) 

36.43 39.62 A: (( lot of it's wasted i think i think there should be like some kind of )) 

39.82 43.37 A: way of um getting them to um 

43.45 48.67 A: donate like twenty per cent of their salary over a million dollars to charity or something like that 

49.14 50.80 A: (( you know automatically )) 

49.80 56.10 B: yeah only some some of 'em are okay you know but some of 'em the salaries are just kind of 

56.35 62.04 B: you know ridiculously high i mean aroff of course that's the number one guy right now 

62.39 64.01 B: like twenty five million that's 

62.46 64.22 A: yeah 

64.07 67.38 B: just ridiculously out there you know 

66.12 67.20 A: but i mean 

67.29 72.46 A: well then who should get the money 'cause i mean you know they they do make a lot of money for these teams 

72.99 77.65 B: ah that that's true also but you don't want the owner to be keeping all the money for just 

77.05 78.06 A: yeah 

77.95 79.37 B: being the owner 

78.59 80.14 A: who should get the money 

81.16 88.01 B: well i mean i guess a lot of the a lot of i guess football has got the united way they do a lot of donations to that 

87.46 92.53 A: i think it should be mandatory they should like like take out a certain percentage 

91.44 93.51 B: like in the contracts or something 

92.85 101.51 A: yeah like like every baseball player that plays should have a percentage of their income automatically given to charity and and 

100.22 102.21 B: (( like a cap or something [laughter] that's incre- )) 

102.60 107.71 A: i mean like an extra tax like a they could call it like a 

105.33 106.23 B: yeah 

107.79 109.10 A: (( i don't know a )) 

109.34 111.48 A: (( charity tax you know )) 

111.77 113.30 B: sure yeah 

112.23 114.41 A: that would work 

114.42 117.30 A: (( but i mean ah the i guess we're supposed to talk )) 

117.67 121.36 A: about striking i guess they have the right to strike you know 

122.00 125.11 B: (( yeah it's just that with )) 

122.13 123.53 A: for whatever reason 

125.17 135.50 B: striking in any other manner it's just you know the government is not supposed to i mean i just think about like working and striking and stuff like that yeah i mean they have the right to strike for what they 

134.38 135.51 A: yeah 

135.67 136.58 B: believe 

135.74 136.87 A: i 

136.83 142.15 A: i i think i mean obviously it's not like their first option i don't think anybody who plays 

142.06 152.92 A: any kind of sport like if you are making that much money playing a sport chances are you love playing and you don't want to strike unless you really have to so if they really feel like they have to strike then they should be allowed to 

152.98 157.05 B: i mean they they do enjoying playing it's the love of the game for them and stuff 

156.79 158.74 A: (( oh yeah you have to )) 

157.51 159.97 B: (( that's your life you know [laughter] they are )) 

159.45 167.21 A: absolutely if you if you are like at that level and you have been playing since you were like a little boy and it's all you eat breathe and think about you know 

167.82 169.91 A: but let me ask you a qu- question 

170.34 173.62 A: do they pay for these things for these survey things 

173.62 176.90 B: supposed to pay us ten bucks for a call 

176.02 179.34 A: have you have you like gotten paid yet for it 

178.47 181.35 B: this is only my second day though i've i 

181.34 193.73 B: i received ah two calls the other day not yesterday the day before and actually they called me three times and one of the calls i missed i didn't get to my phone on time and this is my third one so they are supposed to pay ten dollars a call 

183.96 185.01 A: (( ah )) 

189.54 190.45 A: (( oh )) 

192.05 202.22 A: okay yeah 'cause i just didn't know how they do that that's really good but um yeah getting back to the topic i guess i guess we both agree um 

195.61 197.11 B: (( how did you hear about this )) 

198.74 200.65 B: (( oh that's all right )) 

202.34 208.98 B: yeah i mean they have the right to strike you know it's their prerogative i mean why don't the players get together you know 

202.48 203.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

209.56 219.52 B: when they are like one big entity just striking all together that's even they just kind of there has to be some kind of a deal made in between between the owners and the players a 

220.35 222.05 A: so what do you think about um 

222.21 226.34 A: setting up some kind of a charity tax like on top of whatever they pay in tax 

227.13 236.65 B: charity tax just depending on what kind of what level like they should have brackets of what just like just like a tax bracket like if they make this much then they have to donate this per cent 

235.52 241.99 A: what percentage they make over five million dollars a year or i mean then like 

242.13 244.78 A: like any owner that makes like every 

244.92 254.72 A: for every dollar like say like for one million to two million it's one per cent and then from two million to three million it's 

255.28 268.17 A: two per cent and then three million to four million four per cent yeah like some kind of a graduating thing and then that money can be used for college athletes who get injured while working towards the pros you know 

256.84 259.36 B: yeah it just goes up the more you make 

268.16 275.92 A: guaranteeing that they have the ability to go back to school you know because you have got a lot of people out there who want to become sports stars 

275.85 286.22 A: and they get injured or for whatever reason they don't make it and then they find themselves not having gotten into college education and then they are screwed and they turn to a life of crime or gambling or you know 

286.77 288.22 B: (( yeah oh no )) 

287.16 288.15 A: (( what )) 

288.69 292.58 A: i'm saying sure they could have some kind of a safety net you know 

292.53 295.88 B: i'm just thinking i go to the university of texas and 

297.02 301.10 B: roy williams who took out an insurance policy just like the guy from the hurricanes 

301.24 303.09 A: yeah 

302.71 312.01 B: an insurance policy like if they get injured before like what if they can't play or something they get whatever their policy is i don't know i i just heard that for the first time this past year 

312.95 313.79 B: (( so )) 

313.46 317.35 A: from what i understand though that's only for um 

317.58 318.61 B: (( college students yeah )) 

317.71 320.98 A: for what do you call it um [lipsmack] um 

321.38 327.91 A: the the professional athletes that have already made it they're the ones who um 

328.14 342.10 A: who have the insurance but like college athletes i remember there is like a bunch of times you had these guys who were like you know about to go turn pro and then they get injured like right before like in the last season of college 

342.00 344.09 A: and they're screwed i mean 

344.30 352.88 A: they're completely screwed so there's got to be some way of protecting them 'cause by protecting them and allowing them to play hard and entertain people 

352.92 355.70 A: you know that's a good thing for sports in general 

355.86 361.75 A: but if they get injured then you know they're screwed you know you know what i'm trying to say there has got to be a 

360.10 361.59 B: (( i hear )) 

362.27 364.27 B: (( what you're saying and then )) 

363.57 364.92 A: yeah 

364.66 370.40 B: not only are they going to continue what we're doing i mean you know 'cause sport's like a big part of 

370.41 372.45 B: (( i would say almost everyone's life )) 

372.51 375.42 B: (( you know in the us i don't know how or )) 

375.47 376.56 B: what you think 

376.75 379.62 A: no it's a part of america man sports is 

379.17 383.42 B: about that everyone you know watches something or another 

383.06 385.00 A: yeah the whole competitive 

385.17 386.64 A: nature thing 

387.06 395.01 A: you know [noise] being being competitive and working hard and you know competing against other people
