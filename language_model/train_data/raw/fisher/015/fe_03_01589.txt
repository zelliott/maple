0.84 3.05 B: my name is anthony clinton 

3.61 4.48 B: hello 

4.06 6.14 A: hi my name is david geldon 

5.99 7.66 B: oh hi david how you doing 

7.53 9.43 A: pretty good 

8.61 9.56 B: oh 

9.67 12.19 B: so what do you think about airport security 

12.20 15.54 A: what do i think about air- port security 

13.66 15.26 B: yeah 

15.76 19.79 A: well uh with all of the terrorism 

19.84 22.11 A: uh going on 

21.73 22.80 B: [cough] [noise] mm 

22.33 30.47 A: i just find it to be uh a necessity in this day and age something that we just have to cope with and uh 

30.60 32.26 A: work with 

33.47 37.88 B: i do too uh but i i think pretty much that it that um 

38.60 51.27 B: it it it should be reformed in a way where we don't have to um like you know grab grandma grandpa in their golden age if they get ready to go and take a fly 

51.33 61.59 B: um to some um like um montego bay or some place like that you know where they never been before and they saved up all their money i mean of course we know 

61.72 65.96 B: we know they're not no terrorists or anything like that um 

65.82 69.58 A: [noise] well we hope yeah we would hope not yes i i understand 

65.97 67.03 B: but then 

69.13 80.86 B: yeah we- well that's true too we would hope not but there's no way of really telling you know what i mean because um then the other side of that is is is a kind of degrading 

76.40 78.23 A: exactly 

80.92 84.28 B: on the other side but then we do need that because 

84.38 89.15 B: that stops a whole lot of peoples from getting you know hurt 

88.77 89.82 A: right 

89.22 94.05 B: you know what i mean so i mean i can't i can't really knock that or what have you 

94.01 100.91 B: but however i would like to try to find some ways to improve it where 

100.84 110.18 B: you know i mean there's got to be another solution or something or other like that other than the solution that we have or we can still use that solution and another solution 

109.83 111.48 A: mhm 

110.40 125.33 B: to work um with it um where peoples can feel still comfortable and uh security can still do their job as well um i was thinking pretty much of finding how 

125.63 133.07 B: um the security people feel that work security in the airports how do they feel about it um 

132.90 141.82 B: you know do they have some type of ideas or what have you but some changes could be made to make progress a lot better or to make it better than what it is you 

142.09 143.94 A: right right 

142.73 149.87 B: know because you know those are the peoples that work out there and they put their lives on the line every day because it's not 

149.89 157.07 B: um one of your regular jobs that y- you know because you don't know what you're getting yourself you don't know what's coming through 

152.43 153.36 A: (( mm )) 

156.91 158.44 A: exactly sure 

158.02 159.67 B: yeah you mhm 

158.56 160.63 A: no understood i agree with you 

160.87 168.49 A: uh uh the only thing i could probably add to that is in the recent months that i have flown you will run into uh 

168.90 174.75 A: situations where uh as you said grandma and grandpa it amazes me 

175.06 182.08 A: and that's one reason i said it it amazes me how these security people seem to check exactly 

182.52 190.70 A: the opposite of what i would suspect they should check it just seems uh i mean we can't stereotype people but uh 

190.73 194.33 A: i have seen some checking that is just outrageous 

194.50 204.25 A: whereas i have seen some things go through the gates that i just am appalled by that i just don't understand why they weren't even looked at twice so uh 

204.35 209.77 A: there's a l- lot involved there and i don't know these are s- supposedly professionals 

209.92 214.65 A: that uh conduct these things i don't know how good their training is but 

214.77 219.35 A: in my instances i have seen some people that uh 

219.82 226.23 A: there is no way i would h- harass or whatever you want to call it these individuals uh 

226.27 231.29 A: 'cause [laughter] like you said they're grandma and grandpa they ain't doing anything to nobody 

230.21 233.07 B: no no they- they- they're not okay 

232.45 240.86 A: and uh in other aspects i've seen people that you'd think they would try to stop and check out and they they don't seem to they look the other way 

233.56 235.21 B: (( [cough] mm right )) 

240.94 246.86 A: so i am very leery about how well the airport security actually is to be very honest with you 

247.17 251.40 A: i i believe we were supposed to hire a certain amount of uh 

251.43 254.98 A: workers to take care of this after uh nine eleven 

255.38 256.81 A: and uh 

257.35 266.13 A: i i believe this hiring must be going on i'm not sure i haven't seen at my local airport i have not seen nothing uh 

266.43 272.99 A: totally changed uh as far as that goes it just seems like there's just more time restraints and uh 

273.45 276.98 A: it's real hard to identify but then again being a 

277.19 282.89 A: normal u._s. citizen it's not my job to sit there and identify who might be a 

283.05 284.39 A: terrorist or 

284.47 286.61 A: uh be doing things so 

286.86 301.79 A: i just think it's something you've got to look into a heck of a lot more than we have already we i don't think we've put a heck of a lot of time as you said i believe there's other alternatives and i don't know who's looking into 'em but i've really not sat back and thought about it all that much okay [noise] [noise] 

301.21 306.47 B: well the people that are doing the security 'cause i am in security myself 

306.39 321.22 B: um but i from the years that i have worked as as as as as um y- y- you can't just work i mean you can go on instincts on certain parts and things like that and and the- then there's a lot of pressure i believe 

321.15 324.39 B: on the peoples that work security also 

324.27 332.38 B: because they have to constantly look you know it's pretty much like a traffic controller you know you've got to keep your eye on that screen 

328.68 330.69 A: mm definitely yes r- 

332.20 333.12 A: right 

332.25 345.60 B: you know and see what's coming up you don't want the plane to crash into another well you're keeping your eye on uh on the scanner to make sure no metals is coming through there and then if there is any kind of what have you 

345.56 350.63 B: and they only have what is it plastic explosives or something other like that that they use 

349.89 350.90 A: sure 

350.90 355.89 B: that doesn't even show up so it makes it even much more harder you know what i mean 

354.62 363.19 A: mhm oh no i know it it is a difficult job i'm not denying that at all it it's just as i said um 

358.92 360.79 B: yeah right 

363.18 371.70 A: it just seems like they're maybe the training or some aspect of it needs to be looked into a little further 

371.17 381.71 B: yeah well i i i agree with that um because some kind of subtlety has to be um has to when when you sure that a person is not bringing nothing on 

371.78 372.71 A: you know 

381.64 389.97 B: you know well you want them to also enjoy their trip and if the the the not to feel like they being threatened when they get on a plane 

389.70 390.80 A: correct 

390.09 395.72 B: because the where how you know you do your job to approach so um 

395.92 398.98 B: that's a a a very tricky 

398.69 401.18 A: yes it is it definitely is 

399.45 400.65 B: uh um 

401.12 403.74 B: tricky part there you know mhm mhm mm 

401.19 401.90 A: my- 

402.43 407.86 A: right my experience i was a military police officer some years ago 

407.93 415.10 A: uh and i did a._w._o._l. escorts throughout the united states meaning riding prisoners on commercial jet airliners 

415.03 428.98 A: uh i did have to carry a weapon on the plane i had three ways of doing it one was uh giving the loaded weapon to the pilot even at that time okay b. right or keeping my weapon without the ammunition 

429.19 430.24 A: okay 

430.05 444.27 A: or uh what was the third alternative i have to it throws me right at the moment but i'll always remember going onto that plane 'cause they would always board the normal oh well the regular passengers first and then they'd board us 

444.06 447.25 A: last into the back rows um 

447.57 453.88 A: even at that time this is before [noise] all this occurred it just seems to me that there was 

454.14 462.50 A: nobody really all they wanted to do is get to their destinations and it didn't seem like a big deal to anyone 

461.65 463.15 B: (( right okay )) 

462.72 464.99 A: as far as that goes and uh 

465.62 478.99 A: i know that's no answer that's it's just something that i feel and uh i just think training's got to be more extensive and screening of the people has to be a little more extensive 

477.38 483.75 B: [cough] excuse me i um you know the point that you was making about that i um 

483.77 485.04 B: i never um 

485.56 492.84 B: how would you say that i i just well just regular security okay um i too carry all right 

489.03 489.78 A: okay 

492.72 500.98 B: um i'm not working right now 'cause my wife was sick she had a aneurysm problem yeah but she's coming along pretty well [cough] 

497.12 498.57 A: oh i'm sorry to hear that 

500.17 501.41 A: that's good 

501.47 508.23 B: but my thing a- about that kind of um thing i watched it on the t._v. they um they had um um 

508.30 515.19 B: a program that was on the movies and um it had to do with a- about putting prisoners and stuff on there 

515.43 528.46 B: if you were you know like with security-wise i think and you've dealt also with other people being on there my answer is if you're not sure of anything is to put 'em all to sleep 

523.17 524.20 A: mhm 

529.19 530.79 A: put 'em all to sleep 

529.29 544.25 B: put 'em all asleep every last one of 'em knock 'em out but however i would go and i would check to make sure that the doctor that was putting 'em out okay for that particular time or what have you 

544.29 546.90 B: is you know he's one of us 

546.92 547.98 B: okay 

546.93 548.71 A: uh-huh okay 

548.16 554.20 B: or what have you all right now the they'll still carry a weapon or whatever it will still be the same procedure 

554.06 568.12 B: because you never know there's something can go b- something can go wrong with that but putting 'em out as you would know of yeah i i would say that that way the other um civilians that would be on the plane 

558.17 559.52 A: mhm 

563.79 564.76 A: okay 

568.57 571.69 B: won't have to really it it would cut down the risk 

571.96 573.53 B: (( do you understand what i'm saying [cough] )) 

574.43 581.35 B: if they make it where they'll have one bad he- hell of a headache when they wake up but they'll be all right you understand what i'm saying 

579.28 587.68 A: correct correct yes i do understand sure it sounds like a feasible thing that would have to be looked into a lot 

582.01 583.60 B: yeah i mean 

587.37 587.97 B: (( yeah )) 

587.69 591.95 A: because then you have a lot of health risks as far as that goes some people just can't 

590.73 598.55 B: it would cut down prob- it would cut down the probability of anything going wrong on that plane you know 

596.96 599.89 A: well right any time you instill fear in someone
