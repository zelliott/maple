132.40 133.08 A: oh 

133.58 148.39 B: and uh i'll listen to well news radio and they and and they start giving sport scores and it's a defeat and it's it was a a courageous effort and it was excuse me uh this is a game we're talking about 

140.11 140.87 A: (( [laughter] )) 

142.70 143.84 A: (( [cough] )) 

148.36 159.46 B: courageous effort courageous effort is what somebody is i- you know who is who is fighting cancer is doing [laughter] somebody who is batting a ball around uh four bases you know [laughter] 

155.02 155.86 A: [laughter] 

160.14 161.34 B: i i guess i'm 

160.45 161.86 A: (( a good point it's )) 

163.44 164.64 A: a good point 

164.43 167.14 B: i guess i'm a little cynical i d- [laughter] just don't 

166.47 170.98 A: well i feel the same way about c._e._o.s that make 

170.30 171.87 B: (( oh isn't that awful )) 

171.16 176.77 A: millions and millions of dollars and then they're they're basically screwing the 

177.04 178.65 A: the j- the the 

179.05 180.63 A: the worker bees 

180.02 181.82 B: certainly certainly 

181.23 186.26 A: um out of their benefits or their retirements or their whatever 

186.41 187.91 A: um but they're 

188.21 189.84 A: getting these lovely 

190.22 191.42 A: (( um )) 

191.84 195.69 A: golden parachutes and and [sigh] 

194.11 206.53 B: it's like that in everything but i think some of them are a little more exaggerated than others when when you have the um power to make the decisions you're not gonna to cut your own salary [laughter] 

206.98 209.77 B: you're gonna cut somebody else's the worker bee 

209.41 215.02 A: well at one point i think it was the japanese had a system whereby 

215.27 220.61 A: the c._e._o. couldn't make but five times more than the lowest paid worker 

220.43 221.20 B: (( hm mm )) 

221.28 234.25 A: and you know there were various levels in between but basically the top point was was five times what the lowest salary was and you know the more i think about it the more i like that prospect [laughter] 

233.67 236.18 B: i'm wonder- i'm wondering if they still do that 

235.47 236.43 A: (( uh i )) 

236.75 243.40 A: i don't know if if that was worldwide spread or or what probably not 

243.23 244.82 B: (( well the japanese have have a )) 

243.90 246.22 A: but i really like the idea 

245.89 258.00 B: yeah well w- us worker bees should get together [laughter] and and go on strike i think that was part of the question too the the these these people at high high salaries have the 

248.35 250.53 A: (( [laughter] the )) 

254.23 255.43 A: (( strike )) 

257.06 262.03 A: well but they're only striking for more money and i think they're overpaid to begin with i 

260.91 266.86 B: exactly exactly the point they they they they just and i think it's unfor- 

266.03 268.87 A: mean you can't go to a football game here 

269.15 273.10 A: you can't afford to it's fifty or sixty dollars for a ticket 

272.49 276.98 B: oh my lord i haven't even attempted to go to a professional game of anything in like 

276.06 279.52 A: well i'm going [laughter] actually going to a baseball game tomorrow 

279.16 280.33 B: oh wonderful 

280.17 282.95 A: but it was free tickets so [laughter] 

281.71 284.25 B: that's even better [laughter] that's even 

283.45 285.55 A: but somebody paid for them 

285.12 287.66 B: oh of course yeah yeah 

286.93 294.46 A: [lipsmack] um in fact it was uh they're they're corporate box seats so i know they probably paid big bucks for 'em 

291.47 293.27 B: oh you're gonna have a wonderful time 

294.03 295.44 B: oh yeah 

294.97 299.06 A: but i i can't see that 

300.50 302.14 A: it makes sense 

302.75 303.58 A: (( [cough] )) 

304.02 312.16 B: but there you go again we're we're asking for for for life to be logical and i don't think it comes out that way [laughter] more's the pity but uh 

308.01 309.81 A: [laughter] 

310.95 316.35 A: so what you're saying is we should be out there learning how to play baseball really well [laughter] 

315.50 319.00 B: yeah but i you know then then i back to would i want to 

319.38 320.64 A: (( oh )) 

320.12 331.11 B: [laughter] i mean i've retired and and i i i i don't work for a living any more they just mail my cheque and that's wonderful um best thing i've ever done for myself 

322.95 324.02 A: (( i don't know )) 

327.76 328.82 A: [laughter] 

331.15 342.45 B: but i don't think i would've wanted to do that i don't think i would've enjoyed it so i i think it has to be a calling but i think they let down so many of their fans who truly do loo- look up to them uh 

342.44 347.53 B: uh i think their fans should get a life [laughter] bu- uh but it's 

344.92 346.25 A: [laughter] 

346.70 352.73 A: i know that's where world world uh wrestling federation or whatever they're called comes in [laughter]

351.80 354.28 B: god do they make big bucks too 

353.86 356.60 A: oh they make horrendous amounts of money 

355.97 357.37 B: oh that's sad 

357.06 361.27 A: and they've charged these people these ungodly amounts for fake 

361.45 362.70 A: wrestling 

362.38 364.89 B: oh my goodness well see i'm not
