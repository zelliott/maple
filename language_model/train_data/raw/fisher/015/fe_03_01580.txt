0.21 1.89 A: hi this is jenny 

2.23 4.03 B: (( hi this james )) 

4.15 9.31 B: uh i'm a twenty eight year old from new york um who are you 

4.17 5.05 A: hi 

9.30 13.45 A: um i'm a twenty four year old mother of two from oklahoma 

13.40 16.52 B: oh great well nice to uh speak to you 

16.93 20.49 B: and it's an interesting topic i i guess uh 

19.45 26.32 A: [laughter] it is in fact i went on vacation last summer and and gotta see the the airport security at work 

21.98 22.95 B: i might 

26.78 27.90 A: so 

27.05 29.64 B: you got uh you got to see it okay 

29.42 32.09 A: yeah i got to experience it [laughter] 

31.26 35.18 B: and yeah did they make you take uh your shoes off [laughter] 

34.15 38.35 A: yeah they made us do everything they even had me take my child's shoes off 

38.20 40.60 B: oh goodness wow 

39.32 42.38 A: (( it was i- interesting [laughter] )) 

42.10 52.85 B: yeah well the thing that strikes me is in the um i've also taken a a couple of trips since september eleventh and since the new security methods were in effect and one thing that strikes me is um 

54.36 55.85 B: you know there's this 

56.75 61.78 B: somewhat understandable effort to uh avoid um 

62.28 69.50 B: uh profiling people and so they they make a lot of people take their shoes off even you know like 

63.78 65.76 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

69.81 73.07 B: twenty four year old mothers [laughter] from oklahoma [sigh] 

71.15 72.11 A: (( i )) 

72.79 80.27 A: know [laughter] i know well the thing that struck me was when they would ask you if you'd left your bag unattended or let somebody else hold it 

80.28 84.76 A: if you were doing dishonest would you really say sure i i handed it to 

80.76 83.21 B: [laughter] 

83.83 86.26 B: oh yeah you know there was this uh 

86.30 91.18 B: there was this strange man i don't know who he was but uh i asked him to hold my bag 

90.62 95.39 A: he just asked me to put this box in my bag for me i didn't think it would be a problem [laughter] 

93.58 101.90 B: yeah yeah well and i think that goes to the the one of the frustrations with it it just seems simplistic 

101.25 102.68 A: yeah 

102.10 108.62 B: doing x. y. and z. and so obviously uh terrorists will use new methods or 

108.78 110.74 B: new approaches 

110.22 113.94 A: they'll be able to to play around it because it's the same way every time 

113.90 115.10 B: exactly 

114.76 116.91 A: yeah but [noise] 

115.95 121.08 B: so i mean i guess where i come out uh in answering the question is um 

121.94 128.99 B: i think the uh the security may prevent certain types of attacks but i don't think it really makes us totally safe 

128.70 134.28 A: no and i i don't think that there's really a way to get us security in there that will make us totally safe but 

134.47 140.39 A: if we eliminated some of the more unessential parts of it and and heightened the ones that would actually help like 

140.42 143.02 A: you know better x. ray equipment etc 

142.64 147.90 B: um-hum right exactly things that actually would detect dangerous 

147.98 152.77 B: dangerous things dangerous like weapons or or um materials 

149.12 150.46 A: (( right )) 

152.55 159.33 A: yeah i i think you know the funding's being sent kinda spent kinda foolishly right now 

158.72 163.21 B: i agree and uh so much money is being spent on security 

163.71 177.03 B: with i guess you'd have to say some hopefully some results but um if you actually look at how much money is being spent i know that yeah it's just that i'm not so sure we are getting our money's worth 

171.98 174.59 A: [noise] but they're not getting their money's worth [laughter] 

176.38 177.30 A: no 

177.59 178.77 A: but 

179.68 189.46 A: i i also don't think you know that they're going to use the same method that they did last time where they necessarily hijack planes and and ram them into buildings or 

187.59 188.15 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

188.17 191.35 B: exactly exactly i mean that's been done 

189.71 190.81 A: (( i mean that was just )) 

191.86 197.31 A: they're gonna think of something that we haven't necessarily thought of yet or don't think is is susceptible to it 

193.48 194.17 B: (( [mn] )) 

197.56 203.21 B: and uh yeah i mean one of the the scary thing i think about um [lipsmack] 

204.46 206.96 B: at least what we know about um 

207.12 215.46 B: hardcore terrorist groups like okay th- is that they're very patient and they take their time you know there were like how many eight years between 

215.66 218.69 B: 'em uh subsequent attacks on the world trade center 

218.50 219.58 A: right 

219.35 221.15 B: so i mean it's not as though 

221.49 228.38 B: it's gonna happen this year but there may be another attack and like you said it probably won't involve airplanes 

228.03 229.19 A: right 

228.66 232.59 B: (( [laughter] um mhm )) 

229.75 230.81 A: and it and it 

231.20 235.75 A: and and rather i mean i i think trying to thwart the attacks is a good idea but 

235.77 242.10 A: we really need to have some things in place for when something happens rather than trying to just prevent it 

242.10 244.92 B: i think that's true too yeah 

244.07 248.83 A: 'cause sadly i mean i i hate to to be a pessimistic but it's kinda inevitable 

249.49 250.57 A: so 

249.68 252.24 B: i i agree i agree i mean 

252.53 260.86 B: there always be some [lipsmack] crazy people who wanna hurt other other people that's that's out of our hands 

257.98 259.00 A: right 

261.58 266.42 B: uh did you see on the news recently uh they are are training um 

267.13 271.45 B: uh training pilots uh to uh use uh 

271.69 273.81 B: so that they know how to use uh 

273.95 277.28 B: guns and they're gonna let them have them in the cock- 

275.74 282.22 A: they're gonna let them have them in the cockpit yeah the only problem is a lot of the the terrorists that 

282.36 285.60 A: you know were parts of this attack were trained to be pilots 

285.74 287.17 A: [laughter] 

286.14 288.39 B: mhm 

287.21 292.97 A: so if you know if joe blow goes out and gets a job with american airlines planning this out ahead of time 

291.02 294.12 B: right now all of a sudden he's gonna be able to have a [laughter] 

293.22 297.60 A: we're gonna have them and they're armed with the gun we've given 'em [laughter] 

296.75 299.44 B: real yeah and you're right and so there's always a 

299.46 304.64 B: there's two edges to any any of these uh two sides of any of these measures [lipsmack] so 

301.84 303.31 A: right 

304.79 310.14 A: i think it would be smarter to try to train them on some sort of hand to hand or something where they don't have 

310.49 312.54 A: you know an actual weapon 

313.15 314.80 A: with them on the plane 

313.50 315.86 B: they're just more prepared 

315.27 316.40 A: right 

316.11 322.33 B: mhm mhm that's a good interesting idea or else if the the sky marshal brought them which uh 

323.53 330.18 B: means that instead of it being a pilot with a gun it's a specially trained and and uh extremely 

329.95 331.29 A: undercover 

330.54 334.96 B: careful you know undercover and very very carefully prescreened also 

331.68 332.62 A: yeah 

334.65 335.70 A: right 

335.80 336.65 B: (( um )) 

337.94 340.77 B: [lipsmack] it's just really complicated 

339.73 347.15 A: yeah it's it's you know i'm i'm glad i don't have the job of of figuring it all out [laughter] i can criticize it all i want and i'm 

344.96 346.25 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

347.33 351.04 A: and i'm just glad i'm not in their spot trying to to get it into place 

351.84 353.27 B: yeah i agree 

352.82 354.64 A: but 

353.95 360.59 B: uh so you said you traveled you traveled uh one time with your family uh since the new things have been in place 

357.84 359.13 A: yeah 

360.49 366.74 A: yeah we came from from nebraska down here to oklahoma when we were still living up there to visit some relatives 

366.41 367.44 B: (( oh okay )) 

367.07 375.83 A: yeah and uh we got laid over and we were there at [noise] like four thirty in the morning to catch the next flight and we [laughter] we were in in bad shape 

376.52 379.45 B: oh goodness and they were taking the kids' shoes off 

379.09 382.88 A: yeah they had us take us her shoes off and checked her clothes and everything 

382.75 383.65 B: oh 

383.40 388.85 A: it was just it was unreal 'cause she was only like a year and a half a year and a half i think 

388.70 390.10 B: wow 

389.39 390.24 A: so 

390.35 394.14 A: [noise] yeah i think we looked pitiful though [laughter] 

393.44 402.81 B: [laughter] yeah i mean every time i tr- go traveling uh with my girlfriend she gets they make her take [laughter] her shoes off 

401.95 403.09 A: (( i know )) 

403.54 404.88 A: [laughter] man 

404.65 409.70 B: and she's like you know the most harmless looking young lady you would ever see [laughter] [lipsmack] 

409.10 415.22 A: yeah i mean they had people like taking foot slops and and sandals and obvious 

415.48 420.06 A: you know pieces of of clothing and stuff off which just cracked me up 

420.46 424.87 A: but i think they have a certain amount of people that they have to pull out of line no matter what 

425.38 432.51 B: right in fact they they have to follow some certain ratios i think they even do it uh i'm not sure but i think they even some sort of a uh 

432.69 438.05 B: random way of determining you know like one 

435.93 437.14 A: (( yes )) 

437.21 438.21 A: yeah 

438.21 440.24 B: [lipsmack] one out out of two or 

440.46 442.74 B: something get searched 

443.23 454.06 A: well i i also know that um if for some reason your flight hasn't been able to go and you have to get a different flight i think they said everybody that that's on that that new flight the rescheduled flight has to be checked 

454.04 455.23 B: oh really 

455.02 464.18 A: yeah [noise] so i mean we were there overnight you know two hours sleep [noise] and they were checking everybody and you should've heard all the the people [laughter] that were mad 

463.65 466.30 B: mm oh i bet yeah 

465.73 467.53 A: but i mean i 

466.48 471.38 B: (( [lipsmack] a lot of them would've been frustrated you understand why they're doing it i mean there's no intention )) 

467.54 468.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

469.21 475.03 A: it's frustrating even though you understand that the intention's there [noise] to keep you know to keep us safe 

475.20 476.81 A: (( [noise] but )) 

476.42 480.97 B: so you're from you're originally from nebraska but you're not living in oklahoma 

480.76 489.20 A: well i i was originally in kansas and uh my husband went to school in nebraska for a while [noise] so now we're down here by his family 

483.27 484.24 B: (( oh okay )) 

486.22 488.00 B: (( okay oh okay oh )) 

489.12 490.15 B: okay 

490.04 492.38 A: yeah so wh- what do you do 

492.37 501.81 B: um i'm a entrepreneur right now uh i'm attempting to keep alive a very small business that i started about a year ago 

501.26 502.84 A: [noise] ah 

502.04 506.33 B: which helps uh doctors to comply with uh the new uh 

506.48 510.87 B: health uh privacy regulations that just went into effect 

510.55 513.02 A: oh i yeah [noise] this 

512.23 515.43 B: you maybe you hear about that on the news or 

515.06 521.67 A: yeah i'm right now i'm getting all my medical records together and such and i've running in different stuff with it [laughter] [noise] 

520.80 530.55 B: yeah i i bet it makes it a little i mean it's intended to [mn] protect your medical records from falling into the wrong hands but it also imposes more red tape and more 

527.54 528.84 A: right 

530.80 535.33 B: complexity on the process [laughter] of actually getting medical records from one place to another 

533.60 534.93 A: right 

535.31 542.86 A: but it you know it's good also because you know there is a lot of identity theft and i think that's one of the methods that people have been using lately 

542.51 546.58 B: [lipsmack] yes that's true and um there's been a lot of identity theft and also 

543.56 544.55 A: is getting 

546.84 555.16 B: just theft of medical data to to use against individuals so for example if you had a medical condition 

552.54 553.58 A: right 

554.56 558.50 A: we're having that with my husband's work right now i yeah 

556.72 558.09 B: (( really [lipsmack] )) 

558.53 560.70 B: (( how did you get )) 

558.59 564.32 A: he's got he's got a medical condition he needs a surgery for and the insurance doesn't cover it until september 

564.53 565.57 B: it oh my 

564.58 565.60 A: so 

565.65 568.72 A: they're they're telling him if he misses any more work before the 

568.82 572.55 A: the procedures he has to have until he has this surgery that they're gonna fire him 

572.63 574.73 B: oh god 

573.45 577.45 A: so we're going through all the equal opportunity crap and oh it's a mess 

576.70 583.08 B: glad to hear it yeah you should definitely pursue your rights on that because i don't think it's legal for them to do 

579.94 580.82 A: yeah 

582.39 586.55 A: it's not but they prey on your ignorance they they plan on you not knowing 

583.44 584.19 B: (( that )) 

585.30 587.58 B: (( ex- oh wow )) 

587.42 588.47 A: so 

589.16 592.20 A: yeah this is an interesting program they have running 

592.15 595.87 B: yeah it really is um this is my third call how 'bout you yep 

595.47 598.33 A: this is my first i i was intrigued by it i 

598.11 599.89 B: how did you find out about it
