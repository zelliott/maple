454.00 455.25 B: exactly 

454.79 465.49 A: if we keep on worrying about it you know i think i will never go i'm a student in college and i think i would i would i wouldn't even go to school if i [laughter] if i worried about it but mhm

467.73 470.69 B: but no i don- i i think that i think that 

470.54 484.03 B: little things you know i think the security can ward off let's say that somebody you know wants to you know hurt another person and it's more personal as opposed to a terrorist type thing i think those kinds of things you can you can kind of
