1.59 3.00 A: (( sonny )) 

3.09 4.42 B: cynthia 

6.07 7.03 A: hello 

6.91 8.04 B: hello 

7.92 10.83 A: yes my name is sonny 

9.99 11.51 B: my name is cynthia 

11.38 12.48 A: oh right 

12.66 15.54 A: [cough] so we're supposed to talk about high salaries 

15.64 17.29 B: high salaries 

17.73 19.50 B: for athletes 

19.51 20.38 A: okay 

20.26 21.45 B: okay 

21.51 22.50 A: um 

23.31 36.25 A: ah i think it depends on the sport um such as baseball which does not have a salary cap and i think that's all right but i think it's more fair if there is a salary cap 

36.13 41.07 B: you think it's fair if there is a salary cap um so do i 

36.28 37.44 A: in my opinion 

38.82 39.92 A: yes 

41.32 42.14 A: okay 

41.98 53.78 B: because it seems like most of the time when they make um an abundant amount of money they have more problems you know as far as um drug use and criminal behaviour 

47.22 48.09 A: right 

49.53 51.17 A: right 

54.09 58.33 B: you know for some and perhaps the money itself could be a factor 

54.24 55.21 A: right 

58.55 66.23 A: right and the people who are having strikes in any sport which is baseball which does not have a salary cap 

59.18 60.34 B: (( you know )) 

66.38 68.07 A: (( which is a good point to note )) 

69.34 70.58 A: (( so [noise] )) 

72.21 73.27 A: um 

74.13 76.63 A: i don't know what else to say on the subject really 

76.05 78.10 B: no so 

78.16 83.80 B: is there a salary cap on hockey or do they make as much as the other professionals do 

81.12 82.07 A: ah 

84.44 94.13 A: i'm not sure if there [noise] is a salary cap on hockey but ah they don't make as much as the other ones it's not as much of a popular sport as baseball or football or basketball 

93.56 94.70 B: really 

94.48 95.35 A: yeah 

95.01 98.26 B: it seems like they would get good salaries too though i mean 

97.68 103.96 A: yeah i'm sure they get good salaries but i'm not sure if there's a salary cap or not the average the average is probably lower than 

101.26 102.25 B: anything 

104.15 107.51 A: the other sports like baseball and football and all that 

106.87 108.80 B: mhm 

108.05 110.25 A: it's just not as popular in the states 

110.38 116.08 B: right so what what do you think the highest paid sport is 

115.77 118.46 A: baseball i think is well i think 

118.56 122.32 A: i think soccer is up there in international play 

122.00 123.25 B: mhm 

122.78 125.75 A: but in the states i think baseball which is ah 

126.45 129.79 A: like in the rangers alex rodriguez makes 

130.34 134.78 A: a lot of money i think his contract was well over a hundred million 

134.88 137.37 B: really wow 

135.60 140.55 A: yeah which is really high he's one of the highest paid players i think 

139.67 141.73 B: that seems a bit much 

141.56 143.25 A: yeah it is 

142.20 147.07 B: and that's just for one season or that's for a number of years 

145.42 152.00 A: it's part of the contract yeah a number of years i forgot what i think it might have been ten or something like that but it's still an 

152.17 154.44 A: extraordinary amount 

153.64 160.04 B: right now does that include like when they um that's like that's year round 

154.71 155.67 A: so 

159.86 161.25 A: when they what 

160.69 163.44 B: that's like year round 

162.65 164.99 A: yeah year round 

164.57 167.87 B: so they're paid when they are on off season too 

168.40 173.29 A: ah yeah i am sure they do because they have to practice and all that then it's just their career 

173.08 175.40 B: mhm 

173.47 175.37 A: but 

178.20 179.66 A: go ahead 

178.89 183.12 B: i would think that ba- i actually thought basketball was the highest paid 

183.33 185.15 A: no they have a salary cap 

184.85 187.39 B: mhm and football also 

185.77 186.81 A: (( so that's )) 

187.50 189.49 A: football has a salary cap also 

189.16 190.58 B: oh okay 

190.62 201.40 A: but ah baseball doesn't so you can whoever is the richest that's why the yankees everyone says the yankees win all the time because they pay all their players a lot of money and everyone wants to go there 

196.88 197.95 B: mhm 

200.43 201.45 B: right 

201.46 203.24 A: so they end up winning 

203.46 209.70 B: yeah but the higher person gets paid doesn't it make it make us pay more for the cost of a ticket 

210.65 212.53 A: yeah that's probably true actually 

212.42 213.32 B: (( you know )) 

213.13 217.37 A: also on the demand of the team how good they are doing 

216.98 218.58 B: mhm 

217.80 223.14 A: the sport maybe it could be new so that could have an impact on the price 

223.91 225.12 B: so it's a team 

224.09 226.56 A: [noise] go ahead 

225.95 231.75 B: if the team hasn't one a championship in a few years then it means everybody's salary will drop 

232.19 236.90 A: ah if well if they win a championship then they get more money actually 

237.04 239.82 A: the league will give the team money whoever wins 

239.85 241.02 B: okay 

241.39 247.15 A: the team actually gets more money but in salary caps of course the salary cap will always be the same 

248.48 255.08 B: so if the team wins they get their original salary that they signed on for plus an additional just for winning 

252.76 254.14 A: (( right yes )) 

255.12 256.95 A: (( exactly )) 

256.67 259.12 B: that's a lot of money 

258.06 263.35 A: and i think you get you also get ah more money if you get in the play offs 

263.75 269.53 A: and get into the finals and then winning that's even more so there's different levels of what you get extra 

266.18 267.72 B: mhm 

269.90 270.98 B: wow 

270.54 272.66 A: but yeah 

272.10 274.26 B: that's an awful lot of money 

273.97 277.93 A: yeah there's a lot of money in sports that's why but a lot of people watch it 

277.37 278.60 B: mhm 

278.38 281.21 A: superbowl's the number one watched sport 

281.15 283.76 B: wow mhm 

283.78 284.55 A: (( [mn] )) 

284.09 286.50 B: i never knew that 

285.58 286.97 A: yeah 

287.23 289.97 A: but i don't know what else to say on the subject 

289.45 293.21 B: i know it's kind of hard hard 

290.51 294.33 A: [laughter] ten minutes is a long time for that 

293.61 296.21 B: ten minutes to to talk on that subject 

296.12 297.49 A: yeah exactly 

297.64 303.19 B: well why is it that the inter- why do you think it is that the international players make less money 

303.78 307.25 A: international players make more money in the sport of soccer though 

307.27 308.78 B: mhm 

308.10 311.18 A: because i in my opinion i'm pretty sure 

311.25 315.50 A: it's true that soccer is the number one sport in the world 

315.79 318.24 B: oh soccer is number one sport in the world 

317.63 320.50 A: yeah it's just not number one in the states 

320.19 321.57 B: oh okay 

320.95 323.97 A: but every every country around the world plays soccer 

324.49 326.77 B: but do we actually have a soccer team 

327.24 333.92 A: yeah we have a soccer league in in america but it's just not it's not it's not as popular at all 

333.35 334.82 B: mhm 

334.33 337.27 A: i mean if if you look at the players a lot of the players 

337.35 340.81 A: the europe they have the best leagues of soccer 

340.50 341.83 B: mhm 

341.56 344.85 A: and i don't think they have salary caps either so 

345.21 352.75 A: they can pay their players as much as they want but a lot of the retired players from europe come over to the states and play in the american league 

345.28 346.29 B: wow 

352.47 353.57 B: mhm 

353.21 359.31 A: because it's not the talent isn't here the talent is in europe or other places 

358.79 359.73 B: mhm 

359.79 360.69 A: so 

360.83 367.00 A: this is more popular but yeah the soccer players internationally get a lot of money specifically in europe 

365.00 365.96 B: mhm 

366.76 367.71 B: right 

367.85 369.69 B: i didn't know that 

369.45 371.01 A: (( yep [cough] )) 

370.03 377.43 B: i actually wouldn't even think you know i didn't even think about soccer actually when they said that you know when they brought up the subject 

375.65 376.62 A: yeah 

377.47 380.33 B: because like you said it's not too popular here 

380.41 393.42 A: right not at all it got a little bit popular during the last world cup and and ah u._s._a. made it into the play offs but they didn't get very far yeah 

390.12 394.91 B: but that's all we didn't win though we just made it to the play offs 

394.25 395.60 A: yeah 

395.02 397.29 B: well i guess that's better than nothing 

397.13 402.31 A: exactly it got a little bit popular for that but the popularity went down real quick 

402.00 403.23 B: mhm 

403.33 405.51 B: wow didn't last long huh 

405.36 411.72 A: yeah didn't last long at all i like to play soccer so i hoped it was going to go up but it didn't work out 

410.74 416.07 B: so do you think that if we actually start paying our players a lot do you think we have 

416.98 421.11 B: as many people who would participate in sports if their salaries were actually less 

421.96 432.63 A: ah well the salary if you look at it it is still pretty high compared to other careers people people would still play i mean you know like the minimum might be like a hundred thousand dollars 

426.79 428.18 B: mhm 

432.22 433.24 B: mhm 

434.03 435.83 A: and that's a lot 

435.24 438.10 B: yeah that's that's still a good salary a year 

437.93 444.17 A: yeah so regardless i think people will always go into sport because the salary level is still high 

443.84 445.30 B: mhm 

444.69 450.51 A: this is compared to other people in the same sport some might get a lot more than others when there is no salary cap 

449.98 451.22 B: right 

451.04 451.83 A: (( so )) 

452.35 453.77 A: that's that 

453.69 454.69 B: (( mhm )) 

455.06 458.49 B: well they really gave us a tough tough subject here 

455.56 456.23 A: (( [cough] )) 

458.25 459.72 A: they did 

459.17 460.27 B: [laughter] 

460.10 463.66 A: i don't know what else to say i wish they'd give us questions that we could answer 

463.45 470.93 B: i know it would make things a lot easier especially since i am a woman and i i mean i know some of our sports and 

470.48 471.68 A: right 

471.09 474.73 B: everything but i didn't expect a question like this 

474.57 475.62 A: right 

475.09 478.07 B: well actually who do you think is going to within the play offs then 

478.25 479.49 B: basketball 

478.48 483.88 A: for for basketball well i'm from dallas so i'm going for the mavericks 

480.08 481.01 B: mhm 

483.64 485.01 B: (( oh okay )) 

484.35 486.45 A: they're playing today at 

486.61 489.91 A: ah eight thirty central time i'm not sure where you're from 

489.60 492.02 B: um i'm from orlane city new jersey 

491.92 493.15 A: oh all right 

492.56 496.53 B: yeah so i actually like the lakers 

496.69 498.13 A: you like the lakers 

497.54 499.18 B: (( yeah )) 

498.36 499.92 A: you don't like the nets 

499.82 502.97 B: ah i like the nets but they're not my favorite 

503.00 504.05 A: yeah 

503.47 516.43 B: no they're not my favorite i mean iverson is good and all like that plus i think lots of times when they make these high salaries if you notice they tend to buy their way out of um situations that they get in 

508.28 509.93 A: yeah 

516.46 517.93 A: (( exactly )) 

517.34 519.85 B: and they're they're public figures 

520.07 524.04 B: for the most part for people they are basically public figures 

523.66 524.70 A: (( mhm )) 

524.09 529.84 B: and that does they they are an image for children whether they realise it or not 

530.02 531.05 A: right 

530.44 531.88 B: and i think that 

532.04 538.80 B: maybe along with all of that salary they should have some responsibilities as to living up to a certain 

538.88 540.14 B: standard 

540.20 541.25 A: correct 

540.67 542.65 B: you know because a lot of kids 

542.88 549.50 B: think what they're you know because they are sports players that they can't do anything wrong and then when they do the kids try to copy 'em 

549.49 550.95 A: right exactly 

549.55 550.54 B: (( you know )) 

550.76 555.65 B: so i think if maybe they had a little bit more responsibility along with that 

554.58 556.18 A: yeah they are role models 

556.30 558.32 B: yeah whether they want to be or not 

558.13 559.43 A: exactly 

558.70 562.19 B: everybody even for adults they're role models for adults too 

562.08 563.12 A: correct 

562.53 565.20 B: and lots of times they don't realise that 

565.30 566.34 A: right 

565.76 569.32 B: and some of them i mean they are in like daryl strawberry for one 

569.73 575.64 B: [laughter] you know he's in and out of rehab i mean it can happen to anybody don't get me wrong but 

570.68 571.92 A: [laughter] 

576.06 579.90 B: i think he he takes for granted his position 

580.11 586.77 B: you know and he just constantly does the same thing over and over where if it was you or i 

580.29 582.10 A: yeah 

587.17 589.05 B: it wouldn't be tolerated 

588.93 590.03 A: right 

589.32 599.95 B: you know would not be tolerated and i think that along with those high salaries they should have moral responsibilities and a lot stiffer ones than what they give them they like slap 'em
