0.21 1.91 B: hi i'm joy 

1.41 3.36 A: hi i'm ed how are you 

3.45 5.09 B: i'm good how are you 

4.97 6.57 A: fine thanks 

6.67 10.49 B: excellent i actually haven't flown recently how about you 

10.67 14.99 A: um i have i flew i flew to chicago two weeks ago 

15.01 20.45 A: and and i um have recently flown to ah england 

15.27 16.03 B: (( yes )) 

20.16 22.03 B: oh wow that's about as often 

21.83 25.44 A: yeah where where airport security was kind of high but 

25.43 26.77 B: [laughter] 

25.85 27.20 A: [laughter] 

27.69 31.88 B: yeah did you get caught up in it for a long time or did you move pretty quickly 

32.14 36.95 A: um it was actually pretty quickly i think um my wife and i left from 

37.36 38.65 A: (( boston which )) 

38.73 39.59 B: oh 

39.97 42.00 A: was you know which was obviously where the 

42.03 45.20 A: original terrorist attacks occur- came from 

44.76 46.33 B: yeah yeah 

45.81 52.57 A: and um so it was it was kind of weird going through security there and just kind of having a flash back and thinking about that but 

52.17 53.60 B: yeah 

52.89 60.11 A: but ah it wasn't too bad and and it was kind of weird um you know in in the 

55.68 56.63 B: oh good 

60.70 65.64 A: u._s. you have to take your laptops out of your bags and open them up and everything for inspection 

65.46 66.78 B: right 

66.05 71.57 A: um but in england they asked you to keep your laptops in your bag 

72.48 73.85 B: interesting 

73.23 75.65 A: [laughter] is that kind of odd 

75.45 77.88 B: (( [laughter] yeah that's very odd )) 

78.23 79.18 A: and 

78.40 80.32 B: i don- yeah that doesn't make sense 

80.09 90.94 A: yeah and americans don't really trust um searches done like in other countries because once you've entered the u._s. again if you have a connecting flight you have to go through u._s. security again 

88.63 89.40 B: mm 

91.09 92.70 B: (( yeah jeeze )) 

92.32 94.65 A: (( yeah i know it's kind of over the top but where )) 

94.79 97.13 B: yeah that's that's really irritating 

97.40 101.69 B: you know i'm not [mn] looking forward to flying home here in a few weeks 

102.30 103.54 A: where are you flying to oh 

103.64 104.88 B: oklahoma 

104.83 106.29 A: really 

105.95 120.16 B: yeah so i i ah last time i did this i got stuck in chicago [laughter] overnight 'cause we ended up missing our flight but [mn] that that was just that was the airline's fault actually 

113.29 114.06 A: really 

120.75 126.84 B: (( but i don't know hopefully i don't think i'm riding through chicago this time so hopefully it won't be so bad [laughter] )) 

127.71 130.36 A: do you do you generally have good luck when you fly 

130.94 132.86 B: ah yeah usually i 

133.00 136.09 B: can get through security pretty easily and 

136.27 138.49 B: i haven't missed too many flights so 

138.73 141.65 A: yeah i've had a couple of times where my luggage hasn't made it with 

141.83 146.15 A: me um i i lived in poland for a year 

142.52 143.50 B: (( mm )) 

146.25 147.37 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

146.75 158.30 A: and when i came back after being there for that long i had a lot of luggage and um as i was getting off the flight they told me they stopped me and said by the way your luggage hasn't left warsaw yet 

157.70 159.05 B: [laughter] jeeze 

158.82 163.65 A: (( [laughter] yeah like oh great i don't know if i'll ever see anything again yeah but )) 

159.75 161.08 B: [laughter] 

163.22 165.48 B: yeah that that kinda sucks 

166.27 172.18 B: the worst that's happened to my luggage is um i've got like the castors on my bag 

171.94 172.92 A: yeah 

172.85 175.69 B: kinda got shaved off so there's a flat 

175.77 180.00 B: spot [laughter] and it kinda rolls fine but it sounds horrible [laughter] 

179.61 180.84 A: (( oh really [laughter] )) 

180.69 183.69 B: yeah i don't know how the heck that happened but 

183.95 185.73 B: it's kind of a nuisance 

186.16 189.45 B: i don't it doesn't look like it's going to be easy to replace 

190.01 191.95 B: [laughter] 

191.48 192.37 A: (( wow )) 

192.99 195.89 B: (( but yeah i don't i don't )) 

195.92 198.75 B: know airlines are just a headache most of the time 

198.71 202.51 A: well yeah and i really don't think i mean i always have to take off my shoes 

202.51 205.50 B: (( yeah yeah i usually end up taking off my shoes )) 

204.53 209.67 A: you know and the other thing actually what's worse than taking off my shoes is taking off my belts 

209.63 211.30 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

210.38 213.32 A: sometimes i feel really violated when i have to do that 

213.88 215.56 A: (( like or something )) 

213.90 217.47 B: yeah i i try and avoid it's kind of like just wearing like you know 

218.15 219.82 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

219.77 232.36 B: yeah i know it's like go to the airports and in the security line strip down just take off the last time i flew i had like an overcoat and then a sweater and then shoes you know just just strip down the layers and then you go 

232.54 233.20 B: (( through )) 

233.75 235.31 B: [laughter] 

234.38 239.16 A: i i am kind of i'm very happy they've federalized airline security leaving 

239.01 241.48 B: yeah i think um 

241.88 243.94 B: it's more effective 

242.68 243.36 A: (( it )) 

243.73 247.92 A: leaving it yeah leaving it to small yahoo private companies 

248.00 249.75 B: yeah that's kind of sketchy 

251.00 255.81 B: i agree i think that that is an improvement a step in the right direction hopefully 

255.39 262.95 A: yeah although i've read that it's it's costing a lot more than they initially thought it would having the sort of security and they they 

259.75 260.53 B: (( mm )) 

263.10 264.10 A: have 

264.62 268.88 A: a glut of employees over they're overstaffed in some cities 

268.79 269.67 B: wow 

269.41 271.12 A: by a lot and 

271.81 275.67 B: well they should be able to iron or out the details pretty soon though 

275.34 276.27 A: and yeah but 

275.81 276.64 B: (( [cough] )) 

276.32 287.35 A: one of the troubles is they can't you know fire these people so they have i actually think it was in oklahoma somewhere but somewhere in the mid west or 

284.20 284.94 B: (( right )) 

287.81 293.97 A: i don't know kansas or oklahoma or something they had like thirty people on staff 

289.76 290.53 B: mhm 

293.81 294.89 B: oh good lord 

294.16 297.51 A: at airports that only have like three hundred pe- passengers a day 

297.85 301.63 B: yeah that's that's kind of silly 

301.23 305.45 A: yeah well and they can't fire the people now and it's hard to relocate people so 

305.67 307.42 B: (( yeah that sucks [mn] )) 

308.38 309.30 B: (( yeah )) 

311.19 312.32 B: it's just it's 

313.04 318.21 B: (( i i can't help but wonder how effective it is you know hopefully though )) 

319.86 324.31 B: be more effective than before [laughter] 

322.73 328.94 A: you know yeah look obviously [laughter] but did you see recently they're training pilots with guns 

329.31 330.83 B: i think that's good 

330.27 332.40 A: (( do you really [noise] i don't think so )) 

331.86 333.64 B: i really think that's good i 

334.82 336.13 B: mean you know 

336.91 341.49 B: you can't rely on anybody else mm i think that's a good thing 

340.77 346.59 A: yeah i'd rather just have big padded doors on it that are unable to be opened than i 

347.09 347.98 B: well 

347.78 351.41 A: mean if you i'm against guns in general 

351.08 352.81 B: yeah yeah i can 

352.12 356.82 A: especially in airplane because if you shoot out a window they'll depressurize you know 

357.40 361.76 B: it's risky but you know if somebody's hijacking the plane 

362.16 362.95 B: (( [sigh] )) 

362.88 363.84 A: yeah 

364.76 367.47 A: (( maybe a baseball bat or something i don't know )) 

367.69 369.35 B: (( yeah well when they )) 

369.47 370.90 B: improve flights 

371.45 373.71 B: non fatal weapons that would be 

374.45 377.01 B: preferable but for now 

377.30 379.70 B: options are a little bit limited 

380.74 384.61 A: (( but yeah yeah i don't know i'm just i don't think guns are the answer for )) 

385.03 387.47 A: almost for anything except for cops but 

387.38 388.81 B: yeah 

388.00 394.83 A: the other thing i think is ridiculous is some of the airlines [laughter] for security reasons give you plastic knives instead of real knives 

394.16 396.42 B: oh god yeah that's such a pain 

396.38 405.86 A: yeah because because i've seen this i saw a report on sixty minutes um about about um if you really want to make a weapon 

406.01 414.25 A: on a airplane you could out of out of a can a tin can you know you could cut it in and a half and and you can really gouge someone's neck or something i mean i don't want to be 

410.83 412.43 B: sure yeah 

413.72 414.89 B: yeah 

414.45 418.04 A: gross or anything you know so getting rid of one of those flimsy little knives 

419.07 425.06 A: [laughter] isn't really going to i don't think you can't hold them by an airplane with a butter knife 

420.66 422.14 B: (( [laughter] seriously )) 

425.18 428.86 B: yeah i would hope not [laughter] that would be kinda sad 

430.56 434.99 B: but yeah i don't know some of the stuff seems so a little insane but 

435.65 438.57 B: i guess you just kinda do whatever they possibly can 

438.42 442.70 A: yeah yeah oh i also read on something really funny 

442.82 450.97 A: article about air airport security about actually it might be a good idea this author said why don't we in answer to the problems is just everyone fly naked 

451.17 453.10 B: [laughter] 

451.99 454.10 A: [laughter] 

453.12 455.49 B: (( that would be really funny )) 

454.62 456.95 A: (( what do you think of that that when )) 

456.87 463.18 B: oh my god i think that would cut down on my flying but you know [laughter] 

460.79 463.04 A: [laughter] 

463.33 465.44 A: that way you could not hide anything 

465.51 468.55 B: (( that's true but then there's still the luggage issue )) 

468.41 470.93 A: oh yeah i suppose yeah 

471.12 473.40 B: naked no luggage maybe 

473.13 474.80 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

474.30 476.97 B: [laughter] cut down on security i guess 

478.07 485.15 B: craziness oh my god i love how they make you take a drink of your water on the way through too 

485.03 486.91 A: yeah oh do they really 

486.26 496.59 B: yeah yeah i had a bottle you know it was either water or vodka or something clear you know and they like take a drink of it and i i had to go back through 

491.61 493.20 A: (( [laughter] )) 

497.13 499.89 B: [lipsmack] and check another bag [lipsmack] um 

501.30 507.09 B: and like went through the same line and everything and he's like take a drink of it again for me please [laughter] like what 

506.77 508.09 A: (( [laughter] really [laughter] )) 

507.60 509.69 B: (( what's changed [laughter] )) 

510.31 518.03 B: it's just oh jeeze i don't know what they think you're putting in your water but and i mean just because you take a drink of it does that mean 

518.70 519.95 A: (( oh wow )) 

518.81 521.01 B: you know there's nothing in it i 

520.80 522.14 A: i suppose that's because 

522.26 524.93 A: (( i don't know like gasoline or something for a bomb come on )) 

525.18 526.20 B: (( don't know )) 

527.82 530.00 A: (( how long do we have to take about airport security )) 

530.51 533.30 B: i don't know [laughter] 

532.27 535.23 A: [laughter] have have you ever done this before 

535.26 537.28 B: (( no i haven't what about you ))
