238.04 239.26 A: yeah 

238.60 245.13 B: and since we've retired he cannot be called up unless there's a massive recall um 

243.89 247.51 A: right well we came close this time i guess 

246.91 248.81 B: no we would love to go back in 

248.37 249.72 A: really 

249.18 257.28 B: oh god there's so many vets are so patriotic right now [mn] they- they're being flooded with calls of people asking can they go back in 

256.99 264.48 A: yeah even even if the wages aren't what professional football players make [laughter] i know 

261.44 263.70 B: [laughter] it's the love of your country 

263.75 265.44 B: and these i tell you these 

265.90 268.63 B: athletes don't care about anything 

268.80 272.97 B: they they have no soul no pa- no no patriotic feeling 

272.41 274.10 A: mhm 

273.51 278.83 B: e- everything comes so easily to these people and they're made heroes 

275.57 277.05 A: yeah 

279.11 280.60 B: because they play basketball 

280.37 286.03 A: mhm or football it seems like those are the two biggies baseball is getting pushed out but 

280.79 281.56 B: (( football )) 

285.91 291.58 B: [sigh] l- look at these poor i mean we're sending young people home in body bags 

286.24 287.16 A: um 

291.52 297.13 A: they could be they could feed a third world country on their income 

295.30 296.19 B: country 

296.56 298.47 B: thank you thank you 

297.23 301.81 A: you know they really could i i think that's pretty ridiculous 

298.75 299.79 B: i i tell 

301.15 312.64 B: maybe they should have a service obligation to back to the community they they say they um with all these commercials where they go in and they read to the schools and they donate money 

304.90 306.05 A: mhm 

312.66 315.09 B: but they they don't even need half of those 

313.66 317.48 A: but is it enough is it enough you know 

316.83 318.67 B: it's it's it's not enough 

318.10 320.27 A: it's i don't think it's enough 

318.68 319.72 B: it's not 

319.95 324.23 B: i mean half of their salary should go toward someone impoverished 

323.61 325.30 A: mhm 

325.27 329.44 B: i- if you could just support one family along with yourself 

329.00 330.36 A: (( yeah )) 

329.75 332.54 B: that would be so good that would be a a blessing 

330.94 343.30 A: especially if they're making that kind of money with when they're not hurting for anything and and and you and i are struggling to make our mortgage payments and and our our food bills and 

334.87 335.97 B: oh [mn] 

342.57 348.64 B: i've i've got a child in her third year of college and she wants to be a doctor 

348.10 350.91 A: yeah high dollar 

348.65 350.45 B: and we're paying for it 'cause 

350.51 352.08 B: we- we're not 

352.33 355.51 B: a minority anymore [laughter] 'cause all the money's gone 

353.76 354.96 A: right 

355.59 366.76 B: they don't have a- the the funds that they used to have when i was in school to help pay for college the parents are paying for it now and it's hard you want to give your children more than you had 

364.21 365.40 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

366.37 368.88 A: that's right that true 

368.17 371.01 B: but these athletes they live for the moment 

371.09 376.67 B: and living for the moment is what's killing the majority of them half of them are on drugs 

376.35 377.78 A: mhm 

377.18 378.73 B: i- i'm a social worker 

377.91 383.68 A: steroids and drugs and broken homes and 

379.09 379.81 B: (( yeah )) 

379.85 381.52 B: i tell ya they 

382.62 387.67 B: they're they're always in a conflict in court beating up someone or [mn] 

387.74 389.58 B: abuse at home 

388.68 389.97 A: mhm 

390.25 402.34 A: i think that money will do that to ya if you have an abundance of it where you can do whatever you think you want to do any time anywhere any place and i think money will do that to you 

390.29 391.27 B: uh but 

399.27 400.23 B: (( mhm )) 

402.05 409.70 B: y- it does it does but i don't think it would do that to the average person if they've got uh uh values 

403.64 404.81 A: mhm 

407.24 408.31 A: oh 

409.32 415.72 A: because they have to work for everything they get and they they learn to appreciate it so much more 

411.58 412.23 B: (( uh-huh )) 

415.34 424.98 B: and and what's so strange about it the majority of these athletes came from ghettos and impoverished areas and they've forgot where they came from 

420.97 422.57 A: yeah 

424.39 425.75 A: mhm 

425.82 435.78 B: th- th- well one of the first things they do when they get on television hi mum waving like okay that's good recognize mum but now let's recognize some of these people that still don't have electricity 

429.78 431.25 A: mhm 

435.16 436.69 A: mhm 

435.95 437.94 B: able to feed their kids 

438.04 445.15 B: yes they're way overpaid and when they went on strike i was so glad to see people step in to keep some of these areas going 

439.57 440.78 A: mhm 

445.47 448.38 B: w- why not have a national pay up time 

448.06 461.98 A: and look at the price that they charge the public for a ticket to get in to see those games no wonder their wages are so high you know those auditoriums and those fields they hold lots of people thousands 

450.71 451.47 B: (( oh god )) 

455.72 456.81 B: i would love 

459.99 464.89 B: i'm on the waiting list for the red skins um season passes right 

464.53 465.48 A: uh-huh 

465.19 468.01 B: and uh it's like a twenty year waiting list 

467.40 469.25 A: oh my lord 

468.63 479.45 B: so they came up they added some more box seats in on the second leveling and sent me a note and said uh you can buy box seats so i called to enquire how much they were 

479.60 481.90 B: thirty five hundred dollars a seat 

481.78 483.49 A: a seat 

482.93 487.61 B: a seat every year you pay and it goes up e- every year as well 

483.73 486.29 A: (( oh )) 

487.77 490.86 B: i can't pay thirty five hundred dollars that's my house note three times 

490.62 493.49 A: oh lord 

493.00 498.29 B: but these guys i mean they have box seats and they have their friends in them you know 

499.25 501.09 B: [mn] [sigh] i don't know i guess 

501.18 504.07 B: it's all about the money now instead of 

504.22 506.86 B: the ac- the enjoyment of the sport 

505.33 515.97 A: but you know as long as people are still willing to pay that thirty five hundred dollars a seat they're going to continue to get the income that they want for the for the 

516.03 518.56 A: professional pl- ball players 

517.85 520.41 B: you know you could actually get that financed [noise] 

520.92 523.47 B: you could actually get that financed some 

522.50 524.02 A: really 

523.58 527.35 B: loan companies will finance it for you because it's that's an asset 

527.21 528.12 A: (( mm )) 

528.18 530.31 A: i did not know that 

529.54 538.65 B: and then there was an article um i was on the internet the other day this lady wanted to go on vacation with her husband and she had they had um season passes for 

538.94 553.26 B: um one of the clubs in chicago i the football team i think the bears and so she put it on the internet to sell that one game so they can go on vacation do you know they took the man's season passes away because that's illegal to do 

553.16 553.86 A: (( mm )) 

553.50 556.72 B: it's strictly for your use you cannot sell them 

556.81 558.48 B: and he took them to court 

558.98 562.05 B: and he actually lost 

562.18 565.65 B: because it said on the back of the ticket which no one reads 

565.76 569.65 B: this is for your personal use only cannot be resold 

569.57 572.70 A: i didn't know that that's interesting 

571.02 572.42 B: i- i didn't either [mn] 

572.71 575.88 B: 'cause we've had friends give us tickets to go places to 

576.04 581.54 A: well i i kinda think though if it goes back to the public and the public start 

576.48 577.51 B: (( these things )) 

581.63 593.28 A: saying no to the high prices that you know some of these prices will eventually start coming down and i think it will anyway because the economy right now is getting so bad 

593.14 599.89 A: and i think i think in order for these guys to do what they love to do they're they're going to have to take a little bit less
