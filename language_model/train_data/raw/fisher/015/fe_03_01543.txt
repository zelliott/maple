155.64 158.10 B: (( yeah and so uh )) 

158.17 165.49 B: like i said it i i just haven't seen any of 'em i think worth it and i prob- and there's probably a whole lot more

208.15 209.64 B: uh ethical 

210.01 216.35 B: conduct you you i mean you had to be good people and and you don't even have to do that any more 

213.40 214.98 A: oh well now you can 

215.34 222.08 A: now you can watch t._v. and it's you can read their lips f. this you know all you know they just 

217.21 218.12 B: yeah 

219.12 220.69 B: mhm 

222.02 234.69 A: you know and then the smoking issue and the steroid issue and there's so you know but no one you know they've now said no steroids in minor leagues

239.25 240.58 B: (( i think that )) 

241.52 244.87 B: the young people don't need the heroes that 

244.96 252.90 B: money i vote that sports are something for pleasure and i know competition is real good uh but 

251.25 255.62 A: well sportsmanship is a quality that you know 

253.85 255.57 B: yeah but 

255.76 259.01 A: that that a young child learns from 

258.77 261.04 B: mhm absolutely 

259.52 260.65 A: you know 

260.90 269.01 A: you know it's like you know it's it's like a good president or i mean a president doesn't even make that kind of money 

265.32 266.28 B: mhm 

268.57 269.97 B: mm it's true 

269.98 275.07 B: but if they're going to if they're going to be heroes to the young people 

275.09 279.98 B: then money should not be a factor it should be because they love the sport 

279.86 282.29 A: that's right that's right 

280.32 284.78 B: um be- because they're good because they the sports

353.82 358.82 A: i i don't understand why they have to be so greedy to be honest

358.95 361.45 B: but i do know i don't i cannot 

360.45 362.87 A: that's all it is it's the greed

364.32 365.72 B: an actual 

365.91 370.09 B: sports figure holding this country at siege and that's the way i look at it 

369.71 370.74 A: yeah

382.06 383.79 A: right right 

383.19 389.77 B: and uh it it used to be something to everybody that people loved when they played it and um 

389.48 392.50 A: and it used to be really fun to go watch 

391.89 397.07 B: i don't i don't like to be threatened and i'm sure the countr- the companies don't like to be threatened either 

396.48 404.28 A: yeah well the you know the the like well if i don't get this um they throw a tantrum and don't play 

404.45 405.49 B: mhm 

404.87 408.97 A: and that's and that's what it looks like i'm sure to a child

413.48 414.71 B: (( right )) 

414.36 418.52 A: you know how can you go on strike and cancel the world series it's 

414.79 415.69 B: right

423.97 425.21 A: well sure 

426.23 433.71 B: it like i said it it's just not it doesn't seem to be all that important to anybody anymore to unless lots and lots of 

433.67 437.72 A: well it's it's that's all the importance is the money it's not the game 

434.24 435.20 B: (( things ))

448.85 449.60 B: yeah 

449.67 460.59 B: they could turn up not being and to me i think it would be a privilege to make a good salary and then to have somebody take of care of me if i did get hurt and that would be more important 

460.72 463.43 B: than the money you know 

462.49 471.35 A: i mean they they get they they pull an a you know an a._c._l. or or or pop a knee out and they're still getting all their millions
