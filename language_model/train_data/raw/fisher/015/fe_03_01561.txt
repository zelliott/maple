0.61 1.84 A: hello 

1.16 2.77 B: hi [laughter] 

2.13 4.09 A: hi my name is alice 

3.55 6.63 B: mine is laurie and i had this topic last night 

6.37 9.17 A: um they called me about this last night and i 

9.67 19.36 A: didn't take it because i don't know anything at all about professional sports um this time i didn't answer the phone and my husband ha- just handed it off to me so i didn't know that was the topic 

19.09 30.69 B: [laughter] well it appears to be um sports and entertainers i personally don't know of anybody striking right now and as for entertainment i remember striking was up on broadway 

30.71 38.55 A: yeah and i'm in the new york metro area and that was that was a big deal because it it really you know 

36.14 37.04 B: yeah 

38.39 41.27 B: and i figure that they had a legitimate gripe 

41.73 44.70 A: i'm not completely sure of that 

44.76 48.14 A: um [sigh] the thing is that the uh 

48.85 53.29 A: [sigh] musicians who there are there are union rules in new york city 

53.32 54.30 A: that 

54.45 63.43 A: a show that has any kind of music in it has to have a certain minimum number of musicians that get paid every show whether they really need it or not 

63.08 63.99 B: mhm 

64.25 68.51 A: and um it's kind of kind of an an iffy situation 

68.15 69.13 B: yeah 

69.67 82.35 B: and um but like you said i evidently there's maybe some kind of a strike that's getting ready to happen in one of the sports because it was the sports and entertainment but now mine was a little bit more in depth 

82.88 88.75 B: or unless i missed it 'cause my husband passed the phone to me about salaries did you think that uh um 

88.65 92.58 A: um i think most professional athletes get paid way too much 

88.86 90.21 B: (( they they di- )) 

91.99 97.47 B: i do too [laughter] way way too much i mean they get paid way too much just for breathing 

94.57 95.86 A: (( i mean you know )) 

97.07 101.91 A: you get paid twenty million dollars a year just for being tall enough to reach a basketball basket you know 

101.44 103.21 B: yeah and um 

103.74 105.85 B: i just you know to me it's 

106.08 107.90 B: crazy especially when uh 

107.64 113.12 A: and then they get into these things with with you know women and drugs and crashing their cars and 

112.70 114.38 B: and walk away [lipsmack] 

113.69 115.20 A: yeah 

114.58 120.01 B: it's like diana ross falls over flat on her face and she she [laughter] they drag her home yeah [laughter] 

119.86 121.14 A: yeah well 

121.92 125.93 B: i'd have been in jail in the back seat of a car [laughter] and handcuffed 

125.96 127.91 B: um but um 

128.00 131.36 B: like i say i don't know of any strikes getting ready to come up i don't 

130.63 132.12 A: no i don't either 

131.74 133.94 B: i don't keep up with sports period 

133.57 136.14 A: i don't either i hate sports 

135.81 140.87 B: i- if they all i mean the only thing that we ever watch i'm in virginia and the only thing we ever watch is nascar 

140.70 146.57 A: [laughter] yeah the only thing i ever watch is uh sometimes i watch figure skating if i remember to turn it on 

141.29 142.51 B: and it 

146.44 148.35 B: (( yeah and that's that i don't )) 

147.46 149.61 A: 'cause it you know 'cause that's just pretty yeah 

148.93 155.49 B: yeah i don't quite call that a sport i don't know what you would call that competition more than a sport does that make sense 

152.74 153.86 A: yeah 

154.34 156.62 A: yeah i mean you know they have to be 

156.69 161.39 A: very strong and and all that but uh you know it's just pretty 

158.62 159.76 B: mhm 

162.17 168.18 B: and uh so they could stop playing football and basketball and baseball tomorrow and i wouldn't notice 

168.19 174.23 A: yeah as a matter of fact there's there's a our local radio station that uh for for 

169.01 170.22 B: (( except that uh )) 

174.24 176.88 A: more than twenty years it's been an all news station 

176.92 181.71 A: and then last last year they became the official station for the new york yankees 

181.59 193.48 A: so all the new york yankees games get broadcast and i turn on the radio when i want to hear what the weather is or or the headlines or the traffic and i get a baseball game instead and i get really annoyed [laughter] you know 

191.93 192.82 B: yeah 

193.48 197.29 A: (( i don't want to listen to the damn baseball you know i want to know what the weather's going to be )) 

196.96 207.32 B: i know well i i on the website the other day i read uh the the topics you know you had other topics like pets and stuff like that i was really hoping i wouldn't get sports again today [laughter] 

203.24 204.52 A: yeah 

206.43 209.88 A: um the first one i got oh a a while ago 

209.93 213.52 A: um was about uh com- comedians 

213.37 214.24 B: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

215.60 216.82 B: uh like i say i 

216.01 220.29 A: but that was that was back at the very beginning of the study i think it was before the new year even 

220.00 225.04 B: yeah well i just now joined so i'm i'm in a complete blinder as to this 

221.45 222.84 A: oh okay 

225.06 229.12 B: um but like i said uh i know nothing about sports [laughter] 

229.39 232.91 B: or anybody like i said that's getting ready to strike or anything 

232.35 234.52 A: yeah i don't know anything about that either 

234.21 237.91 B: and i i don't even know or even in entertainment 

238.24 242.66 B: like i said i don't know of anybody out in california and hollywood or anywhere getting ready to 

241.84 254.61 A: i think there was some protests there was some some performers in various fields that were gonna to you know not perform in order to protest against the war but you know the war's practically over now so i mean it would just make 'em look stupid [laughter] 

252.71 253.64 B: yeah 

255.20 261.45 B: uh you know i didn't and d- way the way they was talking they was just striking you know just like walking out and not um 

262.14 264.17 B: not uh doing anything 

264.23 266.16 A: yeah 

264.38 265.02 B: (( you know )) 

265.32 268.05 B: so and i've said i don't know of any 

268.18 271.84 B: that are getting ready to strike right now as far as entertainment 

271.99 273.06 B: (( and um )) 

273.35 274.11 B: (( so )) 

274.13 278.45 B: i'm at a complete loss and but i do think they get paid way too much for what they do 

278.89 285.49 A: yeah and you know it used to be that professional athletes were kind of role models to kids 

280.47 281.46 B: and uh 

285.08 287.43 B: yeah not any more [laughter] 

285.75 297.48 A: and yeah well except that the kids all wanna make that much money and get a contract for uh advertising sneakers and they think that you know if they run around and you know 

297.24 298.29 B: yeah 

297.95 302.66 A: have lots of girlfriends that they treat really mean but buy them expensive presents and you know 

302.62 303.61 B: (( well our so- )) 

303.01 306.50 A: do drugs and party and and generally 

306.63 311.38 A: you know if you have all the trappings of of the athlete's life you'll get famous and of course 

311.49 313.69 A: really if you get picked 

313.33 314.78 B: yeah 

314.86 316.95 B: well i knew um 

317.89 320.92 B: some of 'em do champion for for better 

321.00 323.13 B: causes but not a whole lot 

322.48 326.91 A: yeah most of them just champion for more money for themselves [laughter] 

325.53 326.47 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

326.78 331.33 B: yes a whole lot of more money or more perks and 

331.16 336.13 A: yeah and more fast cars and more advertising deals and 

335.85 336.56 B: (( ugh )) 

336.70 341.68 A: you know their their name on on the sneakers and the the soda and 

341.04 346.13 B: yeah and it was like you know when um was it seinfield and friends and all that bunch 

346.14 352.54 B: you know they wanna come back for another season but they want this amount of money or that amount of money and now um 

352.69 354.17 B: who was it uh 

355.36 361.15 B: [sigh] keanu reeves keanu reeves he's put his own money into that ma- the second matrix so 

357.73 358.76 A: yeah 

361.59 368.07 A: yeah i'm i'm waiting for that to come out i i really want to see that i'm i'm a big fan of that kind of stuff 

363.56 364.44 B: yeah 

368.31 371.17 B: and um so i'm hoping on that too it 

369.65 372.57 A: yeah i wanna wanna see those 

372.85 379.78 A: um keanu reeves is just a little weird you know he's he's not just in it for the money he's he's in it because he's weird 

375.62 376.53 B: yeah 

379.59 380.73 B: [laughter] 

380.09 381.15 A: [laughter] 

380.84 382.97 B: and he likes acting too i think 

382.17 385.14 A: yeah but um 

386.14 390.95 A: you know like like some of the t._v. shows they they just keep wanting more and more money every season 

390.79 391.88 B: yeah it's like 

391.09 397.01 A: or certain actors want more money so that they wind up killing off their character like i don't know if you watch e._r. 

396.87 398.23 B: yeah 

397.59 408.05 A: but you know when when they had that whole long drawn out thing with dr green dying of brain cancer you know i think that's 'cause the actor wanted more money or wanted to make movies or something 

403.05 404.38 B: mhm 

407.64 416.55 B: yeah well it's like uh the guy that plays tony soprano speaking of that it's what just come on t._v. and uh you know him holding out and making the season late 

412.64 413.47 A: (( uh-huh )) 

414.95 416.05 A: yeah 

416.65 418.48 B: on that for more money 

417.19 426.26 A: and then there's that kid that that plays the son that was actually you know in even in the real world trouble for uh drugs and stealing and fighting 

425.41 429.49 B: yeah and i think he kinda pretty much walked away from that one too 

429.23 431.13 A: yeah [mn] 

432.10 433.11 B: i'm sure 

432.30 436.22 A: i think he had to do community service or some nonsense like that 

435.51 437.12 B: yeah 

437.25 441.08 B: probably protected [laughter] his community service [laughter] 

441.38 447.12 B: but like i said i um when they asked this last night and i just for the life of me i can't figure out 

447.21 449.49 B: who's getting ready to strike where 

448.91 450.84 A: no i never heard of that either 

453.51 457.50 B: and um i guess i'll have to listen more to the news in case i get this question again [laughter] 

456.42 460.06 A: i'd like to listen to the news [laughter] but they've got the baseball game 

460.15 460.75 A: (( on )) 

461.72 467.91 B: and it is so weird they pair up last night uh i had another woman to talk to about sports and 

468.19 470.72 B: it was so weird that 

469.71 474.64 A: yeah i got a man to talk to about comedians and i didn't know anything about any any of it 

474.42 475.21 B: (( ah )) 

475.16 477.42 A: but i figured what the heck 

476.93 479.46 B: (( yeah as i said i'm )) 

479.67 486.67 B: i'm just like a complete loss i don't i don't know i guess it's what baseball season coming up but i haven't really heard a whole lot 

485.77 489.90 A: baseball season started a couple of weeks ago yeah 

488.39 492.76 B: did it oh that's right you would know 'cause that's all you get on the t- on your radio [laughter] 

492.18 493.10 A: right 

493.18 497.28 A: maybe they had a big big deal for opening day you know 

497.02 499.40 B: (( yeah like i said i )) 

498.55 501.36 A: i was so gla- we had a big snowstorm here 

501.53 505.33 A: you know a little out of season snowstorm like about a little over a week ago 

503.12 504.68 B: yeah we did too 

505.46 514.17 A: and i was so glad because they postponed the baseball game that day 'cause they couldn't play in the snow [laughter] i was so happy 

511.53 513.12 B: (( [laughter] )) 

514.40 517.62 B: and we had a um a big off season one too 

517.23 520.61 A: yeah well the same storm would just moved up up the east coast 

520.10 521.30 B: yeah 

521.54 524.19 A: most of the time we get some of the same weather you know 

523.79 525.27 B: (( yeah and uh )) 

525.07 527.23 A: (( now if they'd let us talk about weather )) 

527.17 531.74 B: or something else but sports or or strikes and entertainment and 

527.46 529.25 A: you know [laughter] yeah 

529.42 530.25 A: right 

531.12 533.69 A: yeah i i don't know anything about it 

533.25 534.43 B: i don't either 

533.82 541.92 A: and i don't even really know what we're supposed to be talking about because my husband just says i think it's for you pick up the phone and i got that stupid hold music [laughter] 

540.71 545.92 B: yeah well what um do you what this study's exactly 

545.60 550.87 A: i think what they're doing is recording samples of every day conversation 

551.07 553.92 A: trying to analyze language patterns 

553.59 563.04 B: okay that's what i was wondering because that was this this uh university rang a bell with me they used to have a um all the time they gather dialect 

562.97 565.10 A: yeah i think that's what they're doing 

564.82 565.97 B: and um 

566.26 572.52 B: uh 'cause if i'm not mistaken my brother come here one time he he was uh in the university of ridgemont 

572.56 585.86 B: and uh one of the things that was in his course study in english was that he had to record so many different people speaking different dialects of the area where we live and then it was taken and um 

581.94 583.00 A: (( mhm )) 

586.73 589.90 B: put in some archive somewhere so i'm wondering if it is it 

588.47 592.43 A: yeah i think this is a a a big linguistics project 

592.06 593.14 B: yes 

592.55 597.29 A: and i'm i'm all for that kinda stuff although i'm i'm gonna confuse them because 

594.58 595.95 B: yeah i think 

597.39 599.89 A: wherever i go in the u._s. i sound like i'm from someplace
