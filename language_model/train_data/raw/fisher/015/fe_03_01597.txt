4.16 5.71 B: mhm 

6.94 7.92 B: hello 

7.55 9.02 A: (( [mn] hi )) 

8.84 9.93 B: mhm 

9.93 12.01 A: what's your name 

11.71 12.98 B: um indu 

12.94 13.88 A: indu 

13.64 14.66 B: mhm 

14.10 15.74 A: okay i'm yorgen 

15.64 16.90 B: mhm 

16.84 20.55 A: so we we are talking about airport security 

19.89 21.70 B: mhm 

22.20 24.13 B: airport security yes 

23.75 25.30 A: yes uh 

24.60 25.97 B: what about it [laughter] 

26.64 29.83 A: do you want me to to comment on this 

29.24 30.59 B: yeah go ahead 

31.20 32.25 A: um 

33.30 34.23 A: (( uh )) 

36.71 39.85 A: the question again was um 

40.01 48.39 A: whether heightened airport security will make uh travelling more secure is that what it was 

49.63 54.91 B: like the way it's the way it is right now [noise] yes it'd make it more secure 

51.62 52.53 A: yes 

55.29 63.71 B: because they're more strict about visitors coming in and 'cause i think now like you can't go inside the airport you have to wait outside 

64.64 65.63 A: okay 

65.53 68.97 B: mhm so i mean yeah it's more secure now 

69.14 72.88 B: so no terrorists could like ever come in or anything like that 

73.07 75.61 A: would would you would you think it's uh 

76.01 79.84 A: i mean in general if someone really plans on 

80.15 81.45 A: um 

81.88 91.89 A: planting a bomb or something um that's the the heightened security would really prevent this i'm i'm not so sure um 

84.71 86.44 B: mhm 

92.10 100.62 B: well i mean the only way it could happen if one of the security is really like an actual terrorist though which i doubt that would happen but i mean that's like the only way it could ever happen 

100.87 103.14 B: so yeah 

102.54 106.20 A: um yeah i'm i'm i'm s- i'm still i mean 

106.22 110.20 B: mhm 

106.81 110.88 A: as as as uh nine eleven showed us i 

111.25 116.76 A: these people are willing um to sacrifice their own lives so um 

114.36 115.58 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

116.83 118.02 A: if i 

118.51 130.82 A: if i want to kill a lot of people in the airport all i have to do is i strap myself with uh explosives walk inside and blow myself up in the middle of a crowd of uh two hundred people 

126.00 127.43 B: mhm 

130.76 132.63 B: yeah that's true [noise] 

131.06 138.97 A: i don't think that that that can be prevented at all unless everybody is is really get- gets um 

139.82 147.26 A: searched every time uh and even then i i could simply board a bus 

141.78 143.89 B: mhm 

147.58 149.41 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

147.63 152.64 A: or a train from an airport and do the same thing i guess 

149.47 150.74 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

152.88 154.41 A: it's um 

155.99 157.63 A: this is this all 

158.00 164.86 A: been done to sort of ease our minds a little bit but uh in the end i'm not sure whether 

165.24 166.37 A: (( it will )) 

166.45 169.36 A: it may make it less easy 

169.59 171.02 B: yeah 

169.78 182.48 A: uh for an attack but um i'm not sh- i'm i'm i'm pretty certain that it cannot prevent an attack maybe in the air but not on the ground 

179.07 180.29 B: mhm 

180.62 182.57 B: yeah 

183.53 187.92 B: yeah i mean i guess yeah 

188.92 193.50 A: um want our are we supposed to um 

189.81 190.51 B: (( [laughter] )) 

194.05 200.36 A: t- uh really stretch this out i mean does tha- from my from my end i'd i 

200.96 203.99 A: i really that's [laughter] that's the bottom line 

203.80 205.10 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

205.85 210.21 A: any thoughts on your s- from uh on your end 

206.08 206.86 B: (( so )) 

209.89 211.08 B: (( my end )) 

211.43 225.83 B: well i mean basically what i'm saying is i mean the way this the security is going on right now i mean that's fine i mean they're more strict about it and i don't think i mean it's gonna happen ever again unless like what you said someone walk in and just kill themselves but i mean 

217.27 220.26 A: (( yeah )) 

226.02 227.93 B: what are the odds of that you know 

227.44 229.04 A: mhm 

228.62 230.33 B: so i mean i'm [sigh] 

229.07 234.34 A: well what wh- what were the odds about uh people hijacking planes 

234.17 235.19 B: the odds 

234.48 238.94 A: i'm not even i'm not even talking about uh flying to uh 

239.03 244.26 A: um like the twin towers i'm just i mean there was security 

244.66 247.32 A: all along um 

247.75 250.38 A: regarding kidnapping um 

250.56 252.51 A: hijacking airplanes 

252.52 253.73 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

252.72 254.33 A: and um 

254.87 260.12 A: these guys uh as it appears managed to uh 

260.53 266.86 A: hold airplanes entire airplanes hostage with box cutters it it seems 

264.72 266.59 B: mhm 

267.45 271.30 A: it it it it's kind of hard for me to to uh 

271.95 282.66 A: to actually b- i mean i don't know i mean we really don't know what actually did happen but um it seems kind of 

277.92 279.24 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

282.96 288.83 A: i don't know i i find it's it's i have trouble really um thinking that there are 

289.29 290.28 A: um 

291.04 293.80 A: all these people in the plane 

292.50 293.73 B: mhm 

293.86 299.61 A: um on on the plane um just looking on while these guys just willy 

299.10 301.42 B: [noise] hey can you just hang on for a second really quick 

309.35 309.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

312.49 313.37 B: hello 

313.05 313.97 A: yes 

313.93 314.79 B: hello 

314.37 315.35 A: yes 

314.93 316.17 B: yeah okay go on 

316.25 317.71 A: uh i'm still here 

317.65 319.36 B: yeah okay what were you saying 

319.25 331.86 A: well i was i was saying that security was pretty tight before um these guys did not smuggle bombs onto the plane they didn't have guns they had um 

323.64 324.59 B: mhm 

331.90 334.62 A: (( knives box cutters )) 

334.47 335.55 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

335.27 343.51 A: so it seemed up to that point security did work except now that on the list 

342.48 345.99 B: well i mean those securities they were terrorists though i mean right 

345.70 350.46 A: oh yeah sure but i mean y- you can't tell by looking at people 

349.83 357.42 B: yeah that's true i mean yeah you know like planning this whole nine eleven i mean that probably took sev- several years to plan i mean 

357.49 361.30 B: that took like a long time to do for someone to plan all that out 

361.02 363.31 A: well the co-ordination 

363.81 366.17 A: maybe the co-ordination 

364.87 368.22 B: yeah the co-ord- yeah especially the co-ordination 

366.60 369.58 A: but the actual act i'm 

368.51 371.81 B: yeah the actual act yeah 

370.34 372.57 A: i'm not sure um 

371.97 372.90 B: (( oh )) 

374.10 380.78 A: so i guess what it really is is um you know to ease our minds but um 

381.52 382.53 A: (( um )) 

383.46 390.37 A: i don't i don't know i mean i'm willing to go through all these routines as i have um 

389.55 391.54 B: what do you mean by routines 

390.86 398.75 A: um in at at airports to uh yeah the the security like the checks and everything mhm mhm 

393.04 394.67 B: the airport okay 

396.73 402.03 B: yeah i mean even i think when you're going inside the airport they should still check you know 

403.07 411.92 B: because like the like the only place you can go in is like where the luggage like comes in or whatever but you can't actually go inside where people go off to the plane 

411.51 412.87 A: mhm 

412.44 422.83 B: but yeah i mean i still think there should be security outside just like right when you enter there should be some kind of security 'cause i mean like you say someone can just walk in and like throw a bomb right 

423.11 427.11 B: so yeah they there should be like security outside also so 

426.35 430.75 A: well i i i guess to certain degree there there is um 

430.92 441.80 A: um but uh how f- i mean how far will you stretch like within a mile within a couple of hu- within a hundred yards or just in front of the doors 

441.68 443.21 B: yeah 

442.00 443.70 A: i mean um 

443.89 445.64 A: (( i and i've i've )) 

445.90 451.56 A: i'm convinced the next if there is a next a next attack if you want to call it that 

450.92 455.12 B: hopefully it's not inevitable to happen i mean i hope not i mean 

454.81 459.02 A: um it seems these people are very determined and uh 

457.69 459.70 B: yeah that's true 

459.60 466.16 A: uh what- what's been going on with the war in iraq that's just that it's not gonna make it easier um 

462.71 464.43 B: iraq yeah 

465.27 468.04 B: it's not yeah 

466.48 468.65 A: but it may it may 

468.74 477.91 A: uh they may hav- get more support just because of you know us uh invading a sovereign nation so that's that's 

472.55 475.93 B: mhm 

478.64 491.65 A: but i i i think the next thing will probably not be an airp- -port because of all the security um i mean every time i i i don't live far from new york city and every time i take the train or drive in 

485.01 486.62 B: yeah 

491.45 492.56 B: yeah 

491.83 495.74 A: uh you have to take a go through one of the tunnels and uh 

494.78 496.40 B: (( one of the tunnels yeah )) 

496.15 497.16 A: um 

496.45 504.96 B: but you know like this whole bomb thing nine eleven it ju- it w- you know if it's not gonna happen in the airport it can always happen in a store or like a school or anything 

502.51 503.49 A: sure 

504.68 509.99 A: sure but it's um that's not i'm afraid that's not their 

510.32 518.59 A: that's not what they have in mind um they they gonna pick land marks they gonna pick they they'll pick um 

512.19 513.61 B: yeah 

518.59 526.75 A: where maximum damage can be done uh blowing up a little supermarket's not gonna do anything for them um 

521.30 522.69 B: yeah 

525.69 527.73 B: yeah 

527.01 535.48 A: what's what's gonna be more ef- efficient from efficient quote unquote of course from their point of view and i i 

535.36 543.50 A: i'm telling you every time i go to new york i'm thinking of that i just can't help it but i go to new york and i'm thinking 

537.85 539.54 B: mhm 

540.58 542.16 B: yeah 

542.55 549.55 B: i mean that's what i once thought so when they go when they're thinking about new york or heading to new york they're like oh you know what if you know 

549.20 554.01 A: what if they blow up the george washington bridge and both tunnels 

553.05 555.99 B: ye- oh yeah i mean you never know 

554.48 555.83 A: within an hour 

555.84 557.10 A: within an hour 

556.77 558.25 B: (( within an hour okay )) 

557.51 558.89 A: (( yeah )) 

558.80 569.32 A: then i mean that's practically is gonna cut off new york city from the rest of the country um at least by land so 

565.22 567.34 B: yeah 

568.01 570.76 B: (( yeah )) 

569.18 575.13 A: something like that i can see them doing because that would you know that to show 

573.40 574.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

575.23 578.76 A: vulner- vul- you know how vulnerable we we are 

578.49 579.92 B: yeah 

578.77 583.13 A: because that's that's that's probably what uh 

583.21 586.24 A: what their goal is you know to to 

586.28 587.49 A: (( to )) 

586.97 592.73 B: i mean they can always attack schools i mean they probably are aim for that also you never know 

592.77 595.49 A: or anything a hospital i mean uh 

594.75 599.90 B: a ho- yeah exactly a hospital also i mean that's like one of the factors also
