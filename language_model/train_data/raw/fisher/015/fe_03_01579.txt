0.27 2.58 A: hello my name is dee

3.98 5.00 A: dee 

4.66 5.72 B: dee 

5.25 6.43 A: yes 

6.02 9.50 B: [lipsmack] hi dee my name um is peggy i'm from philadelphia 

12.21 13.28 A: yes 

13.16 14.87 B: and um 

14.89 17.30 B: uh do do you travel a lot 

18.18 25.49 A: um i don't but as far as airport security if i think it makes a difference i definitely 

23.49 24.60 B: right 

25.52 30.90 A: think that this is way past due we should've been doing this way back when 

30.27 31.90 B: mhm 

31.76 35.80 A: because if we had we wouldn't have had every 

35.91 47.58 A: john dick and harry knowing how easy it was to push us over we was just waiting we was just out there in the open waiting for something like that that to happen 

47.38 48.70 B: yeah 

48.20 49.57 A: it was too easy 

49.34 50.26 B: uh-huh 

50.45 55.13 A: it was too easy for 'em and um for some reason um 

51.59 52.50 B: yeah 

55.28 61.54 A: i don't know maybe it was godsend we we never thought anyone would want to approach us that way with 

61.56 70.17 A: any type of controversy because we're the big dog [laughter] we don't think that they would want to do that but boy were we wrong 

65.08 66.13 B: (( uh-huh )) 

69.67 70.94 B: (( uh-hum )) 

71.08 74.03 A: we were what are your thoughts on the subject you 

71.23 73.05 B: well i i know 

73.62 81.84 B: well i know i know uh i had gone uh overseas to visit my brother uh he was stationed in the middle east uh years ago 

81.94 91.12 B: and um you know when you got to the airport there no one could meet you at the the gate or anything they gotta meet people like in the parking lot outside of the building 

91.22 97.87 B: and then when you left you know they had to leave you off in the parking lot and it was very different that was about ten years ago 

98.05 101.30 A: know that's the middle east compared to us [laughter] 

98.22 99.70 B: but um 

100.96 106.60 B: y- but no but it's pretty much the same way in ireland and in france also so 

105.81 106.86 A: really 

106.73 113.88 B: um i think the rest of the world's been living with terrorism you know far longer than we have so i think you're right i think we were 

114.03 118.63 B: you know well overdue for you know changing how things are done number one 

119.01 124.18 B: um i just wonder if it's tight enough even today though too because 

123.54 124.68 A: no 

124.30 127.25 B: um you know you see like how you can 

127.28 139.71 B: check your luggage and [sigh] you know i know they're doing random checks of that but it's still t- for me very scary but it was scary before [laughter] you know before that yeah 

127.34 128.51 A: yeah 

136.21 138.97 A: right we just didn't know to be afraid 

138.93 144.77 A: [laughter] you know unless you travel abroad the way you say you have and then you know you saw the difference 

144.37 146.93 B: mhm 

144.64 157.99 A: but most people who travel domestically they do not know the difference and if the difference was imposed back then they would've called it such a big problem and made this big deal out of it and everything 

157.86 167.51 A: but to me even now it is not tight enough but then you have to look at the question how tight is uncomfortable 

162.42 163.44 B: mhm 

167.49 168.52 B: right 

167.95 177.27 A: you understand as far as time and all of that goes i mean you would have to be there three fours [laughter] hours before your flight left if it got any worse 

168.93 169.83 B: uh-huh 

175.83 177.92 B: mhm right 

177.32 183.97 A: so to me we have set forth effort before [laughter] we hadn't even put an effort out there 

183.73 196.47 A: so to me we have set an ef- set forth an effort that i think is pretty rigid in some instance but it needs to be like that and from now on you just pray the rest of the way [laughter] 

190.19 192.00 B: (( mhm )) 

195.13 198.10 B: yes like 'cause i know the first time i traveled 

198.35 210.52 B: uh like for work after september eleven 'cause when i vacation you know wh- when we go somewhere we're usually going by car 'cause it's the only way that's affordable for us [laughter] but i know when i get on the plane you know i 

207.18 208.22 A: yeah 

210.31 214.41 B: just well just going through the airport and the military were still there 

214.45 224.32 B: at that window in time you know and um and that was a little fearful you know but not fearful like you know just seeing people but it was also 

224.32 229.77 B: uh at the same time calming because you knew that they were there to help you know they weren't there to 

229.40 230.65 A: exactly 

230.21 233.80 B: to hurt anybody you know um [sigh] amongst all of 

232.54 246.49 A: and you know uh a lot of people do feel that way if they see uh force around they tense up and you know even people who don't have anything to feel guilty about but to me when i see that i feel safer 

240.38 241.68 B: mhm 

242.66 243.89 B: yeah 

245.97 247.98 B: yeah me too yeah 

247.17 262.05 A: you know i'm like well he's here and you know that makes me feel safer than no one being here but a lot of people think it's a big deal if they [laughter] s- for no reason just out of the blue oh what's going here the you know that's their mindset 

252.29 254.28 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

260.07 260.97 B: (( uh-huh )) 

261.88 262.91 B: yeah 

262.00 266.64 A: but i like that i like them to be around it makes me feel secure it does 

266.05 267.21 B: mhm 

267.44 272.65 A: and the more i see the more secure i feel not that i think i am more you know 

272.45 273.42 B: mhm 

272.74 276.98 A: but um just the more of 'em i see standing around it makes me feel safe 

275.72 285.78 B: [mn] do do you think though that that's deterring terrorists or do you think that if there are terrorists there they're just waiting to do something else in a different way 

285.49 298.66 A: oh for certain [laughter] for certain we are living in our last days and to whatever restraint we will put on ourselves as far as to what extent they will take 

287.12 288.60 B: oh yeah 

298.20 299.64 B: mhm 

298.62 310.15 A: you know the security methods of entering a plane you have to think about somebody is sitting over there who all just [mn] they have to be that type of person [laughter] they're sitting over there 

301.84 303.23 B: mhm 

309.75 310.85 B: (( mhm )) 

310.23 321.25 A: and they are observing this and when we have done all that we feel we can do they will come up with a plan to overlook all this and they're gonna come again 

320.88 321.96 B: mhm 

321.93 336.69 A: uh now that that has been tried and done very well i would say [laughter] other people are looking at us to bring us down too if they bring us down they're the big dogs they will take credit for that [laughter] 

328.03 328.93 B: uh-huh 

335.81 339.18 B: yes yeah it's just a scarier world 

337.59 340.11 A: don't you think they're gonna continue trying 

340.46 345.03 B: i yeah i do because i think yeah i yes 

341.52 346.66 A: especially after this war they will we made a lot of enemies with this war i think 

346.34 347.70 B: mhm 

347.37 357.59 A: so i think terrorism will always be utmost in the american person minds when they travel um 

357.55 365.52 A: not just by air but at all levels i think especially by air because you can get so many people at one time 

360.78 362.11 B: mhm 

364.88 366.23 B: mhm 

365.66 372.50 A: but and i saw on the news yesterday that um they were labor- laboring the um 

372.96 379.27 A: san francisco brid- the golden gate bridge is one of the second highest [laughter] threat 

375.63 376.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

379.13 380.14 B: wow 

379.62 388.71 A: so you know the airports they can get so many more people in one place like that so now they're gonna have to shift i don't know they will always come at us i think in the future 

388.50 389.65 B: (( mhm )) 

389.00 392.98 A: but just open the gateway and to me it's a revolving door 

392.82 393.90 B: (( well )) 

394.02 397.54 B: it's just a very different world because of that you know 

397.36 401.79 A: oh most definitely but you know the sad part about it 

398.38 399.76 B: yeah 

401.17 403.04 B: (( uh-uh )) 

401.86 405.29 A: it won't ever go back to being the way it used to be 

404.98 407.12 B: no yeah 

405.52 406.77 A: no 

407.32 411.37 A: no terrorism will be a part of our life until the day we die 

410.96 412.76 B: mhm 

411.96 414.46 A: you know i think it'll just heighten 

415.32 422.80 A: because i don't think it will go away why would it go away if someone thought they'd made such a big ruckus over here [laughter] 

422.11 424.13 B: yeah they they could do 

423.98 425.62 A: (( well of course )) 

424.46 427.49 B: so much with so few people yes yeah 

427.10 438.30 A: of course and i don't think they're gonna be just you know picking us off the block but you know there's somebody out there i would think several somebody's who think that they can get away with it 

439.30 442.09 A: you know the way people's minds are 

441.69 442.97 B: mhm 

442.85 448.96 A: but i would hate for that to happen again i mean so much is [laughter] going on you know 

445.99 446.89 B: yeah 

447.98 456.13 B: yeah yeah 'cause it's not only without it's even within our own people with the you know like the guy who did that thing in kansas city 

456.46 459.35 B: when they blew up the government building you know 

459.52 460.65 A: yeah 

461.02 466.37 A: and i i think that was some of our problem too uh we didn't have um our 

466.50 470.87 A: [lipsmack] import and export areas you know tight enough 

470.34 471.51 B: mhm 

470.89 477.83 A: that said a lot about our way of thinking [laughter] to me you know that's just the w- 

476.55 478.69 B: yeah we're very naive you mean 

478.97 480.15 A: i'm sorry 

479.71 481.83 B: we're very naive as uh 

481.53 493.53 A: exactly exactly if you're not going to um put a buffer to say around your major mode of transportation in and out of your country 

482.00 483.24 B: yeah 

493.51 497.06 A: i mean what else are you not paying attention to 

496.95 502.38 B: yeah i guess that's true oh my god yeah i guess you're right i didn't think about it that way yeah 

497.12 499.18 A: you know 'cause that's a big deal 

499.45 501.36 A: yeah yeah 

501.43 505.93 A: oh we were just sitting out there waiting it would've happened eventually 

505.34 506.37 B: mhm 

506.03 513.40 A: to me this had to have happened you know this i think this was planned way back when [laughter] 

513.75 521.61 A: and they just got it together to pull it off and we're gonna always live with uh terrorism as a threat from now on i know i will 

521.30 522.36 B: (( right hm )) 

522.29 533.27 A: because i've been made aware of it and then you'll be made aware of it again when you go to travel [laughter] at the airport you know the line is you know a half a mile long [laughter] 

523.92 524.92 B: mhm 

528.63 529.66 B: mhm 

530.71 538.72 B: yeah it's kinda like you could live in denial a little bit if you're not in the airport yeah 'cause it hasn't come up in another area yet you know 

534.98 536.13 A: yeah 

538.85 539.96 B: but um 

539.98 549.57 B: it it you know i think i think probably it'll deter them from doing something the way they did before but they'll find where the hole is and then and go that way 

546.31 547.92 A: exactly 

548.93 550.31 A: exactly 

549.77 551.06 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

550.44 552.26 A: yeah we got that covered 

552.31 555.06 A: i saw on the news um 

555.04 564.33 A: you can tell i'm a news watcher [laughter] i saw on the news just on yesterday that um they're training already the pilots the airline pilots 

556.68 557.58 B: uh-huh 

564.18 572.98 A: they're not making them do it but it's a by choice and if they want to take target lessons and carry a gun they can 

565.99 567.16 B: (( [mn] )) 

572.86 574.00 B: oh my god 

573.14 584.07 A: so as of tomorrow but you don't know what pilots have guns and what pilots don't the airlines are not to be made aware who's carrying 

581.07 582.09 B: mhm 

584.16 592.42 A: but the class was so full it's gonna end um coming here soon about the first of the summer and they're gonna start another one in july 

592.09 593.36 B: mhm 

592.88 599.89 A: so um it's like a voluntary thing they don't have to take the course but i mean who wouldn't want it and once you've got permi-
