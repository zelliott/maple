7.27 8.11 A: pardon 

8.12 9.76 B: oh where are you from 

8.91 11.20 A: oh penn university of pennsylvania 

11.07 17.40 B: oh my friend goes there yeah so what's our our topic of the day is airlines i guess 

12.08 13.37 A: oh really 

14.04 14.85 A: great 

17.45 19.53 A: yeah and security 

19.26 21.10 B: so do you find it more secure 

21.12 34.03 A: um i guess so i guess i i've traveled since nine eleven and it's you know um i guess longer lines and i've been stopped more to have them check my luggage how 'bout you 

34.37 42.04 B: i don't know it seems to be more like face [laughter] they make you do it to make you feel better but i haven't felt an increase in security honestly 

41.35 46.28 A: oh i see what you're saying yeah like in terms of actual security yeah 

44.54 53.22 B: yeah i i i've seen the actual security guy going and checking old grandmas and things and they're checking me for like carrying on knives or something 

52.55 53.91 A: yeah 

53.46 57.42 B: no but unfortunately [noise] i don't see them uh making a real 

57.86 60.22 B: change in the way they do things 

59.90 60.99 A: right 

61.00 67.21 B: though i'd like that they're now scanning like act- luggage that goes in the holds [sigh] 'cause that's kind of important 

66.62 68.75 A: yeah yeah 

69.05 70.20 A: um 

70.46 75.15 A: but they have been doing a lot of profiling which is disturbing 

74.38 77.02 B: (( well )) 

75.92 76.96 A: um 

77.49 81.18 B: it the question is profiling disturbing or is it necessary 

81.34 82.54 A: yeah 

82.59 89.69 B: there there's a kind of a balance of course you could say profiling is wrong but anything the first time you ever do anything for a criminal is to profile 

89.99 91.07 A: yeah 

91.27 92.28 A: um 

92.45 96.93 A: though i don't think it's i think it's i don't think it's necessary i find it a tad racist 

97.01 102.87 A: when they pull aside um when they say there's random checks but really they're pulling aside all the middle eastern men 

99.23 100.82 B: [noise] 

102.50 104.23 B: [laughter] 

103.62 112.36 A: [laughter] um and also my friend she was um i mean all international students you know non u._s. citizens are um 

111.53 113.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

112.33 125.59 A: you know have no rights now and i had a friend who was coming from korea or something and she was strip searched and um like hit and stuff and she just had no um 

113.89 115.68 B: (( [noise] )) 

125.42 128.80 A: legal rights they said that she couldn't do anything abut it and 

128.02 129.94 B: that's pretty bad 

129.33 141.27 A: yeah so i think right now she's taking legal action and um hopefully something can happen but it it's just a disgrace because she has no rights as a as a non u._s. citizen 

141.88 142.87 A: (( so um )) 

142.58 153.05 B: well i'm sure that'd go through the courts my dad back in the day also had problems like that but i i think it's somewhat expected he was a russian so since he had the f._b._i. look at him in the eighties 

151.47 152.43 A: yeah 

152.91 157.97 B: and they act- they strip searched him so basically what he did he started dressing better [laughter] 

157.34 158.82 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

159.21 160.48 A: that's true 

159.81 160.51 B: (( [noise] )) 

160.67 168.07 A: i always i'm always scared for my father who is philippino but he has a his wife is white so i think he's he'll be 

168.09 173.04 A: you know he doesn't get harassed or anything like other asians might 

173.38 174.15 A: so 

174.44 175.95 B: (( well unless you're sheik )) 

176.05 177.37 A: what's that 

176.62 178.99 B: [laughter] i feel sorry for the sheiks 

179.11 181.38 B: no one no one knows what a sheikh is 

179.11 179.95 A: ye- 

181.56 183.89 A: oh sheiks yeah [laughter] 

182.72 184.54 B: yeah 

184.17 185.50 A: yeah that's true 

185.52 193.27 A: and um just south asians too people don't understand um yeah the differences and so forth 

193.50 201.17 B: no i i don't know i i can't say i i like racial profiling [laughter] but for some reason i care for it when i'm flying on an airplane 

201.14 202.21 A: yeah 

201.82 212.97 B: unfortunately because when you think about it you know where where are us- all the attackers coming come they're coming from one region so it's somewhat understandable that they would do something like that 

213.31 219.13 B: when it comes with the air- when it comes to airlines because it seems to be like a trend with these types of things you 

213.51 214.44 A: yeah 

218.43 220.64 A: (( right i know what you're saying i mean )) 

222.04 233.19 A: you know it makes it makes some sense that they would that they would do that and mostly because of how we handle domestic issues so we do a lot of racial profiling with african americans 

222.09 222.82 B: know 

232.56 234.12 B: [laughter] 

233.93 237.46 A: [laughter] and i just can't just justify that i think that's so wrong 

234.40 235.31 B: (( i think )) 

237.45 243.13 B: but i- ironically enough you know a lot of african americans are probably racial profiling of arabs at the airport 

242.55 244.14 A: yeah 

243.60 244.47 B: so 

244.67 252.21 B: of course you know like i it it depends on what you racially profile for there's there's stupid racial profiling and smart racial profiling 

252.13 253.07 A: yeah 

252.33 254.50 B: like when when you're actually like okay 

254.82 261.63 B: you know you've got like a black guy fine you know they they always arrest them for drug charges that's stupid that's like a waste of time 

261.46 262.62 A: yeah 

262.06 276.67 B: that's r- that's not equitable 'cause like you're always but you know when you have like airplanes fine where are the m- majority of the attackers coming from well they're coming from saudi arabia re- regardless of everyone not from saudi arabia is a criminal they should at least be put under additional scrutiny 

271.16 272.12 A: uh-huh 

276.66 287.10 A: yeah i don't [lipsmack] sometimes i think well remember that case where i think it was in georgia or florida or something when there were um a couple i think they were south asian 

287.06 301.84 A: or of middle eastern descent and they were sitting in a restaurant and then this white lady overheard them saying things yeah and they weren't even saying any of that stuff but she just made this huge leap like you you've got to hear what you wanna hear or you think you're hearing 

292.63 293.98 B: yeah 

302.00 308.70 A: um about like they were like bringing a car down or something like that and they'd stopped the highway and everyone freaked out and 

308.51 321.47 A: i think that when racial profiling happens that that's morally more so of cases when the government tells us to take um you know for us to be on the watch and you know be active you know citizens and so forth 

310.38 311.72 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

321.48 323.40 A: that we make big mistakes 

322.94 333.49 B: [noise] well i i- i don't know i can't judge the whole country by lit- little old ladies in georgia because they've they've been like that before [laughter] and after [laughter] 

327.01 328.52 A: [laughter] 

329.68 331.00 A: [laughter] 

332.66 345.50 A: yeah but i don't you feel that the administration is telling us all citizens to be vigilant and um you know report report um unusual behavior and so forth that makes all of us sort of um 

333.57 334.44 B: i think 

336.61 337.95 B: (( [noise] )) 

339.71 340.82 B: (( pr pr )) 

344.73 345.98 B: paranoid [mn] 

345.54 358.21 A: paranoid and feel like we we have the right or the power to you know racial profile ourselves and we get these poor medical students in all this trouble and they have to you know transfer universities and stuff 

358.62 363.16 B: yeah well m- most of the public are stupid so i don't want them doing their own work 

362.57 364.11 A: (( yeah i think i- )) 

363.33 368.76 B: but i i prefer that the police huh you know also get are able to do their job 

365.52 366.59 A: yeah 

369.19 375.31 A: yeah do you remember that there's another story about i think he um this these white people on the airplane 

375.14 386.42 A: saw this um person sitting down um and they thought he was of middle eastern descent and he was reading do you remember that yeah and he was he was reading you know like oh you know he's reading arabic and oh no 

380.42 381.36 B: yeah 

382.01 383.08 B: yeah 

386.19 392.98 A: and it turned out he was like reading chinese or something and he was um half um african american half white 

393.23 395.38 A: do you remember that did you yeah 

393.91 398.73 B: yeah i remember that well people are somewhat paranoid which is to be expected 

398.06 403.27 A: yeah but then and i also think that administration drives us to be paranoid 

398.89 399.92 B: (( you you )) 

402.93 410.43 B: well that's bush his administration drives everybody to be paranoid we we have terror alerts i i think of them more as surfing alerts 

406.22 407.31 A: yeah 

409.98 411.50 A: [laughter] 

410.65 413.00 B: when- whenever it's red i don't go surfing 

413.09 415.20 A: [laughter] 

413.40 418.43 B: you know and when it's green you know okay gotta be careful gotta go caution in the wind 

417.72 418.70 A: right 

418.52 426.18 B: it's not like it affects me or something you go to like our university oh no they put extra guards in the guard booth to seven o'clock and it really stuffs terrorists 

425.75 426.75 A: yeah 

426.40 430.97 B: 'cause the t- the terrorists go through ask the guard for directions before blowing themself up 

430.87 431.59 A: (( hm )) 

431.20 433.02 B: [laughter] or killing people 

433.22 434.36 A: yeah 

434.16 439.73 B: you know like logically okay you know this this makes me feel better when you think about it it doesn't matter 

439.33 440.60 A: mhm 

440.75 445.97 B: of course you know now we take off our shoes at the airport because i mean they couldn't catch a guy that had a bomb in his 

446.71 447.99 B: [laughter] shoe of 

447.37 448.78 A: right 

449.38 455.96 B: course w- would you profile that guy he looked kinda cr- if i saw that guy i would've i would stop him 'cause he looks crazy to me 

449.39 450.17 A: (( sure )) 

455.35 456.55 A: yeah 

457.04 469.07 A: [sigh] yeah that's hard it's such a yeah i guess if it's on the basis of someone looking creepy [laughter] i mean like some type of like someone looking suspicious or something rather than by the color of his or her skin 

468.82 473.63 B: see it's it's hard to tell what who looks suspicious or not everyone has a different definition of suspicious 

473.14 474.19 A: right 

474.36 475.32 A: i know 

475.81 485.22 B: you know i i couldn't care a less about someone doing drugs or what not they're not going around killing everybody usually but you know when it gets to me being blown up on airplanes i'm paranoid 

480.38 482.19 A: yeah 

484.64 486.74 A: so have you flown since nine eleven 

486.15 490.36 B: i fly all the time which makes me like very unhappy to fly 

490.38 492.16 A: oh really so you get a little 

492.48 494.92 A: um anxious yeah 

492.88 505.91 B: everyone gets para- yeah everyone gets paranoid when they fly like uh before i had f- a fear of flying 'cause i like had bad experiences with airplanes you know they drop a thousand feet and you think you're gonna die it's like great it makes you feel real good the and then you go 

502.28 503.26 A: yeah 

506.09 507.34 B: (( you didn't have to like )) 

507.84 508.89 B: terrorists with 

508.98 511.50 B: jack knives trying to kill everybody 

510.83 511.88 A: yeah 

512.07 514.30 B: (( all you had to deal with some mechanical failure )) 

514.17 514.81 A: (( [sigh] )) 

515.86 521.52 A: um yeah i've flown like maybe six times since nine eleven or no maybe more than that 

521.74 523.43 A: oh no no i flew 

523.90 528.17 A: yeah i flew like probably fifteen twenty times or something 'cause i do a lot of traveling 

528.10 542.38 A: and um i've i don't know why i i'm not like scared or anything and i actually what i do is i um make sure that the white people aren't like [laughter] aren't like harassing the people of middle eastern descent while they're in the airport 

537.63 538.30 B: (( [laughter] )) 

543.10 547.51 B: [noise] huh i don't think i've ever noticed that america's pretty liberal 

546.89 548.37 A: yeah 

547.80 551.18 B: uh in general unless you go to somewhere in the deep south [sigh] [mn] 

551.09 552.23 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

551.65 553.62 B: and then you get which i lived 

552.61 554.56 A: is texas the deep south 

554.36 557.99 B: well for parts of it it is if you live in a major city it's not if 

557.87 558.86 A: yeah 

558.30 561.74 B: you live in austin or houston it's not a big deal you have to go to the boonies 

561.63 563.39 A: yeah 

562.20 570.52 B: [laughter] that that accounts for a lot of the south you know you go to georgia go to like out there you have you still have plantation country 

570.65 581.10 A: yeah i went to i was atla- in atlanta the other month and it was really nice there i was actually surprised because i was a little scared and i thought it was the south or something but it was actually pretty nice 

579.77 581.26 B: (( [noise] )) 

581.28 582.46 B: yeah the south is 

582.50 584.66 B: decent as long as you avoid [sigh] 

585.10 594.10 B: small towns or the where there still are quite a few small towns where there's like five hundred people and everyone knows each other and they got the rumors or what not when 

593.69 594.90 A: yeah 

594.38 598.84 B: you're living somewhere like houston there's millions of people not a big deal [noise]
