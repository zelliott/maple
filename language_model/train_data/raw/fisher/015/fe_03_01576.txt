21.78 23.98 B: oh okay okay 

24.71 27.86 B: no 'cause i'm i'm pretty much new with this too 

26.48 29.93 A: [noise] [noise] okay this is only my second one 

28.09 30.01 B: yeah 

30.08 31.30 B: uh-huh 

30.97 39.09 A: so okay well if you wanna go ahead and start i can listen to you as i'm in fact i'm pulling off the exit now so 

33.43 34.28 B: (( [mn] )) 

38.54 39.72 B: okay 

39.73 41.22 A: (( [laughter] )) 

40.17 51.20 B: well it's talking about air s- port security uh is supposed to be the topic um my b- um well my belief is is is pretty much um a- 

43.03 44.18 A: [noise] yep 

51.17 57.29 B: airports should be more safer than what they are um security should um 

51.73 52.93 A: [noise] 

57.43 60.09 B: uh they should have more um [mn] 

60.50 65.80 B: x-ray machines there that scan through so peoples can feel more safe 

62.23 64.00 A: [noise] 

65.80 66.64 A: uh-huh 

65.89 70.69 B: i figured as well as um [sigh] i guess uh 

70.59 83.16 B: a lit- i don't think people should be searched down as much like old ladies that come through and they in their retirement and they're going on a vacation or what have you that's not really a good thing when you think about your grandmother or 

71.67 73.06 A: [noise] 

83.11 94.40 B: your grandfather they're retired and they decided that they wanted to go to take a pl- uh a plane to tahiti and have to go through the airport and the security there is so 

83.65 85.47 A: [noise] 

89.28 91.13 A: [noise] 

94.49 106.56 B: so um intense where we have to you know do that with a old person or what have you i feel i think we should find some better ways of dealing with the problems at hand than 

106.70 114.21 B: um how would you say in um upsetting a whole lot of peoples that don't have anything you know don't have these kind of things in their mind or what have you 

109.56 110.59 A: [noise] 

115.33 116.72 A: uh-huh um 

117.27 123.26 A: right i agree i also think that there's definitely a way i i mean with all of the um 

123.64 124.86 A: uh 

125.00 126.31 A: [laughter] 

126.41 130.44 A: stuff that we have now that there's certainly a way that they can 

130.08 131.40 B: (( [mn] [noise] mm right )) 

130.45 136.26 A: do security without invading one's um privacy um 

136.76 137.96 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

138.24 146.35 A: certainly not any need i don't think to you know have to pat down every person that walks through there they have um 

146.39 147.42 A: um 

148.39 151.65 A: oh i can't think of the word that i'm trying to think of but they 

150.15 152.81 B: they have scanners and they have x. rays mhm 

151.82 155.66 A: right they have the scanners and stuff like that and i think yeah 

155.46 168.17 A: especially because we do we are a country that allows people in and out of our borders relatively freely that we definitely have to have um [noise] the increase for heightened security um 

161.07 162.18 B: (( mhm oh [noise] )) 

168.53 177.23 A: and and i do think i that it is you know that it's definitely providing um more safety than 

177.24 180.75 A: than without the security there um 

181.17 186.12 A: i think that was part of the question too right if we feel like the airports are more secure 

185.72 194.36 B: mhm yeah but you know i i um the main um topic i- on the security part i think should be 

186.51 188.41 A: yeah um 

194.32 198.33 B: ov- as as being overlooked is having people 

198.18 210.29 B: um getting their point of view of it as well you know um y- you could have like a random um like you have random search or whatever when they should have some type of um 

210.41 216.40 B: a questionnaire um for say where they could uh um enhance 

216.57 227.30 B: you know enhance the airport security and make a better relationship with the people that come through there especially when you have peoples that come from other states other countries or what have you 

216.70 217.60 A: mhm 

223.11 223.99 A: mhm 

227.16 237.52 B: the state of philadelphia is not a small place okay like it used to be or what have you so you i think having an open mind and pretty much 

229.81 230.97 A: (( mhm )) 

237.69 238.63 B: j- just 

238.88 241.91 B: being kinda more innovated to 

241.94 255.17 B: um um um um looking in other directions where you say well this probably wouldn't work um f- for security wise or this probably would work for security and and into the same token you're right back where you started from all over again 

255.04 256.09 A: (( mhm )) 

255.13 260.62 B: you know so i think um we have to look at um questioning 

260.53 262.62 B: um having like a questionnaire 

262.47 277.22 B: um people that come through how do they feel about it um how do the security people um because those are the main ones that's up front and they- they're the ones whose doing everything um their life is on on uh is right up front 

277.23 278.20 B: you know 

278.07 292.83 B: um they with terrorists or what have you if they're getting paid enough um um as they doing uh do they feel like they're doing their job enough are they investigate- i mean are they looking into are they they're putting their whole heart into it 

292.73 296.77 B: uh let's face it you have to be you have to be very very happy 

293.89 297.05 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

296.88 299.13 B: okay in order to um 

299.19 302.91 B: to to s- to do the best that you can do 

303.23 305.59 B: (( you know what i mean um [lipsmack] )) 

305.85 308.15 B: so that's why i said a questionnaire 

308.16 313.44 B: um to question people that when they come through well how do they feel like things could be brought better 

313.42 323.52 B: towards airport security how can they be brought better with security on a plane and where you don't have to think about it and where grandma don't have to pull out her shawl to see if she got anything on 

323.49 325.90 A: right [laughter] right 

323.64 331.49 B: her you know what i mean and grandfather what have you got in your back you know what i mean that's not a you know that that kinda thing [cough] what have you 

327.63 328.60 A: right 

329.97 331.15 A: mhm 

331.45 343.94 A: mhm right and the um the security workers there are certainly the ones who would best known um you know how how secure we really are [laughter] um 

342.28 343.46 B: mhm 

344.01 354.12 A: uh right and uh you know i also think that with your idea of the um questionnaire is that certainly when people decide you know people are always very 

354.29 355.31 A: um 

356.07 368.65 A: oh i don't know they [mn] if you give people a choice like if you just present them with a um a yellow wall and you say here you go here's your wall they're not as um 

369.52 377.96 A: i don't know positive about it as if you get a group of g- of people together and you say okay let's choose what color we're gonna paint this wall and if 

376.08 379.10 B: mhm right that's where a questionnaire comes in then 

378.49 381.69 A: exactly right it makes them feel as if they've 

379.26 381.64 B: you see what i'm saying they will come in 

381.62 385.38 B: yeah they will come in and they would see this 

385.15 390.36 B: and they would say oh my god you're giving me a choice here right and 

390.14 402.89 B: how many peoples come through and how many airports actually allow to have this kind of thing to make things better for them you know what i mean because there's some people that travel at least maybe 

398.95 399.79 A: mhm 

402.72 407.75 B: give or take twenty five to twenty six times out of a year on a plane 

407.58 412.23 B: for business or pleasure or i- in between right 

411.97 412.93 A: mhm 

412.05 422.66 B: so if can you imagine out of those twenty six times or whatever it might be every time you turn around you get pants pulled down you've got to go to get through the scanners well the scanners is for your own 

423.01 425.02 B: [lipsmack] benefit and your own protection 

424.98 426.01 A: (( mhm )) 

425.01 438.20 B: to know that somebody coming through there with a a gun or and then the other the to to be scanned down in the metal detector to make sure that there's nothing there these things are for your benefit which is understandable 

428.81 429.88 A: mhm 

437.33 438.60 A: [noise] 

438.63 439.91 B: but however 

440.00 446.69 B: to say i'm coming i i wanna know how you feel about it means a whole lot 

446.55 447.45 A: right 

446.94 461.08 B: you know it means it means a whole whole lot and everything else and stuff but however also the smart thing to do is also go with the security and have have and see how do they feel about it okay what could be brought better 

459.29 460.65 A: mhm 

460.89 464.87 B: what could make them better than what they is without hurting anybody 

463.32 464.13 A: right 

464.98 476.15 A: right or invading anyone's uh you know privacy not not even just privacy but their personal dignity i think is almost more you know that's more insulting than 

465.32 466.26 B: (( you know )) 

473.94 474.87 B: right 

475.77 476.36 B: (( mhm )) 

476.21 483.36 A: invading your privacy i think if i if i have a purse that i'm carrying and i have nothing to hide then i'm not too concerned 

483.49 492.08 A: a- about my uh privacy there but you know to have somebody [laughter] pat me down as i walk through the line is 

490.34 497.37 B: mhm yeah with having would you feel somewhat not i mean not someone you would just feel 

492.21 492.97 A: (( [mn] )) 

497.29 501.22 B: um um degraded a- as put you know like 

499.21 500.52 A: right 

501.00 514.06 B: hey look i paid for my ticket i'm coming through here and you're throwing me out well we seem to think that there's something lady in that bag over there you know what i mean and but there's nothing in here well you want the bag you can take it but we have to take you too 

508.29 509.26 A: right 

509.51 510.54 A: right 

513.90 521.43 B: you know i'm not going nowhere where am i going and you know 'cause they find out there's nothing well we apologize to you but that's our job 

514.19 515.52 A: right 

516.64 517.63 A: mhm 

521.30 524.39 B: it doesn't make it right you see 

521.49 522.67 A: mhm 

523.61 525.07 A: mhm 

524.22 535.28 B: that's why when you have like um even in a community type of a thing um um when you have a watch a watch out look out whatever you wanna call it in the community 

535.11 539.58 B: they all get together and they talk about how could things be more 

539.49 550.19 B: um um better with relations with the neighbors or whatever well and it's the same thing with the airports and the securities you're neighbors but you're just not staying with each other 

541.39 542.68 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

550.33 552.39 B: you know you're just passing through 

550.68 551.53 A: mhm 

552.36 553.46 A: (( right [noise] )) 

552.69 565.34 B: you know what i mean so get their point of view out on it as well and you don't wanna feel degraded and you don't want your fellow man or fellow woman to feel degraded as well you know or what have you 

563.21 564.60 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

565.25 571.26 B: but my true feelings of it is is um if they would've did this a long time ago 

571.18 576.35 B: the questionnaire part which i don't know if they have done it that it would've been 

574.58 575.49 A: mhm 

576.26 586.25 B: i think it would've you know the to look you might not find a better idea to a lot of this but since being at war and there's a lotta of terrorism 

586.34 595.18 B: going on and stuff like that i think right now that's gonna make it on kinda the hard side because whatever we doing it has to be done 

586.91 587.86 A: [noise] 

595.28 599.89 B: you know since what happened in in um new york you know with the world
