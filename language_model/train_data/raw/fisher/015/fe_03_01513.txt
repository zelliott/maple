3.24 5.17 B: hi my name's stephanie 

4.84 6.05 A: hi i'm nicole 

7.31 10.97 B: so we're supposed to talk about september eleventh 

11.03 14.05 A: um i've been more hesitant to take airplanes 

14.66 15.92 B: okay 

17.02 19.49 B: so have you travelled at all 

19.02 21.39 A: no i haven't travelled since [noise] 

22.75 23.85 B: (( um )) 

24.28 30.52 B: for me the same thing i don't i've travelled some but i don't want to 

30.43 39.54 B: travel too far or you know i would just take little short trips that are about maybe a hour away for the flight time or something 

39.25 42.33 A: yeah i've been travelling more like by car and everything 

42.26 43.45 B: yeah 

44.70 46.40 B: [laughter] um 

48.28 52.92 A: i guess i'm more aware of what's going on [laughter] i tune into the news more 

51.01 52.61 B: yeah 

53.23 60.48 B: yeah just to see what the latest is happening in the world and everything 

63.89 65.56 A: yeah 

66.05 66.71 B: (( um )) 

70.48 74.85 A: [noise] so i've been like i just watch the news a lot more now just to make sure what's going on 

73.37 74.50 B: mhm 

77.59 89.41 B: yes i think i i also um read the newspaper more just to read about things and you know also like look on line on the different news 

87.71 90.34 A: yeah i look on line all the news and stuff 

89.99 91.27 B: yeah 

92.10 95.07 B: just to keep informed especially like 

95.44 101.80 B: put the war just to see all the different things that are happening every day and stuff 

101.87 103.29 A: yeah i guess i'm 

102.48 103.61 B: i i know it's 

103.33 106.90 A: it's just that i seem more a lot more aware now after that it's just like 

107.21 111.24 A: wake up call you've got to really look now what's going on 

111.17 112.50 B: yeah 

112.42 116.61 A: because i didn't even like i don't think i even knew there was risk at that time until it was like oh 

117.05 119.61 B: yeah mhm 

117.23 118.16 A: (( you know )) 

118.95 126.02 A: and then they said that like some like i don't know who but i think some people already had like a feeling it was go- something was going to happen they just didn't know where 

126.10 127.73 B: yeah 

126.69 130.43 A: beforehand and i didn't even you know like now they give you the alerts on the t._v. 

130.32 131.28 B: uh-huh 

130.81 134.37 A: like they could i don't know if they did that or not but i didn't even know that they had one 

134.44 135.68 B: (( oh really [laughter] )) 

135.42 140.97 A: you know like now with the war you know it will be like elevated or high risk or whatever on terrorism 

136.29 137.84 B: yeah 

140.14 141.24 B: yeah 

141.76 145.04 A: it's just scary 'cause you know they did it the one time so you never know 

145.37 146.79 B: yeah 

145.65 147.63 A: like who's going to try again 

147.86 150.38 B: you don't know when or where 

149.30 156.81 A: it's really weird because i mean we have pretty much a very i think a very good you know government awareness system like you know we know 

156.86 158.47 A: basically what's going on 

158.45 159.62 B: mhm 

159.55 165.67 A: and they didn't even know where they were going to hit you know just to try to stop anything or warn the people 

166.99 168.62 B: yeah 

169.66 174.64 A: i'm thinking most people that are affected by the planes and stuff like most people were scared to go on a plane again 

174.72 176.78 B: (( mhm and they )) 

175.80 176.73 A: but i think 

176.96 178.18 B: oh go ahead 

177.50 180.70 A: i'm sorry they also like made the security at the airports a lot 

180.91 181.82 A: better 

181.81 182.99 B: mhm 

182.78 184.63 A: like all the extra stuff 

183.05 183.87 B: well 

184.82 195.33 B: well i mean i've travelled some since september eleventh but personally i don't think that the security in airports is that much safer 

194.81 196.18 A: really 

195.53 196.96 B: yeah i mean 

197.14 203.55 B: they're slowly getting on it but sometimes you know it depends on the people i guess 

203.79 207.30 B: and i know that they tried to you know have more 

208.12 217.15 B: [sigh] workers that are you know look out for things and stuff but sometimes they just don't feel that they look thoroughly [laughter] but 

214.82 220.72 A: yeah and you've got to be scared about the trains and stuff too it's not just like that's the only time they could hit you is the airplanes 

219.86 224.89 B: yeah yeah anything actually where like there's a lot of people i think 

224.09 225.99 A: yeah 

225.24 226.94 B: could be targets 

227.36 230.64 A: yeah because i live in philadelphia so like they i remember they um 

230.85 236.74 A: like had them all zoned off and put new security in like the not the statue what was it called the liberty bell and stuff 

236.62 238.86 B: (( mhm yeah but )) 

239.23 241.72 B: historical sites and stuff 

243.83 252.67 B: and i think also i always had second thoughts about visiting new york because i always wanted to go visit but i don't know 

251.38 259.96 A: yeah yeah i did too i always wanted to go and i never got a chance to but now i'm kinda like i mean i know it's like most likely not going to happen there again but you never know 

258.20 260.64 B: yeah but still [cough] 

260.00 262.70 A: just 'cause like the memories are still there for everybody 

262.58 263.66 B: mhm 

264.13 271.03 B: or and when they said that you know the some of the terrorists actually lived over there so um 

270.22 272.12 A: yeah 

271.80 273.59 B: yeah 

272.42 276.79 A: this is really scary to know that like the people are just like plotting against us like that 

276.55 277.67 B: mhm 

279.87 283.54 B: and i think like when the war started um 

283.82 294.82 B: for me i live over in the san francisco area so you know there's a lot of historical sites and i cross a bridge every day to go to work and 

294.12 298.78 A: uh-huh oh really and that's another thing like bridges and stuff they said 'cause so many people are 

299.22 301.11 A: you know on them at any time 

299.50 300.74 B: yeah 

301.08 302.30 B: yeah 

303.13 306.25 A: i was also thinking like not the world trade centre but um 

306.26 311.49 A: what else is there in new york there's other there's a whole bunch of big stuff in new york with all the people crowded 

311.21 314.26 B: yeah there's just like time square 

313.10 317.08 A: yeah it must be that's such a big city like everybody's there 

316.93 318.59 B: yeah 

320.46 329.02 B: and then they also said like they that the malls or apartments complexes would be could be targets or something ah 

326.14 327.44 A: (( yeah it's )) 

335.32 341.14 A: just it's scary when you don't know like what they're looking for like i mean i know like they just look for what has a lot of people but you don't know 

341.16 342.41 B: yeah 

341.64 343.35 A: what kind of thing you know 

344.47 346.28 A: like malls like i know 

347.29 351.64 A: some of the biggest malls like there's one like one of the biggest malls around here 

351.46 352.92 B: mhm 

352.47 355.90 A: like i think it's i don't know one of the top five in the country or something 

356.20 357.65 A: that's around here 

356.68 358.83 B: in size oh okay 

358.67 361.86 A: again like the biggest malls are like huge like this one has like 

362.27 372.09 A: it's two stories but it's like broken off into two so it's kind of like two regular malls like at one place and it's like say a lot of people can sit there and you hit that it's like a lot of people right there 

367.12 368.44 B: wow 

371.73 372.89 B: yeah 

375.75 380.67 A: i just think i think most people are just more aware like with the news i think more people are watching the news now 

380.24 381.12 B: (( mm mm )) 

382.28 387.24 B: do you think that things are safer the way the government is handling this 

386.14 393.27 A: i don't know i heard like that they said that like because they're putting like so many more pe- like jobs and stuff for the security 

392.91 393.90 B: mhm 

393.41 398.03 A: i heard that like they're slowly like it's supposed to be like taking away our freedom 

398.64 399.91 B: oh really 

399.53 405.84 A: i heard that i heard i don't know i forget what i was looking at but somebody said that like it was just an editorial 

405.61 406.57 B: uh-huh 

405.92 408.75 A: but they said like we're not realizing it right now but 

408.79 413.37 A: that they're like slowly taking away our freedoms and like the constitution like they're you know 

408.92 409.80 B: huh 

413.72 416.70 A: because now like you know because they're trying to prevent the terrorism 

416.69 418.29 B: yeah 

417.33 418.34 A: but i mean 

418.55 423.55 A: some of it because that one guy they're looking for he's like last known address was like the u._s. 

423.91 425.04 B: oh really 

424.56 426.39 A: like i don't know who it is now 

425.93 426.78 B: (( i don't know )) 

426.61 429.89 A: something for the war 'cause he's a terrorist and it's like 

428.03 428.93 B: uh-huh 

430.25 432.67 A: he's in the u._s. like it's really freaky 

432.54 433.82 B: yeah 

433.94 437.77 A: like when they're in the u._s. it's like that means like how are we really going to stop them like 

438.03 439.00 B: uh-huh 

438.83 441.77 A: if they're already in there they're already in their plan or whatever 

441.77 448.40 B: yeah and they should have stopped them um before they even came in or you know like don't even let them in 

449.73 454.14 A: i think like we nothing but i think our country just lets everybody in 

449.73 450.49 B: (( [mn] )) 

454.04 455.16 B: yeah 

454.71 463.45 A: like we really do like none of the other countries who haven't had these kind of problems like terrorist problems because they don't like and i think a lot of people are jealous because we have freedom 

459.72 461.61 B: mhm 

463.78 464.82 B: yeah 

465.23 472.48 A: and that's what i just think that's what's going on i think they're jealous because we have freedom or they don't want their people to know about our freedom and you know 

472.56 473.93 B: yeah 

474.53 479.33 B: [cough] and so they'd rather just come in and ruin what we have or something 

478.35 479.95 A: yeah 

481.41 486.75 A: it is it's just scary when they're in the u._s. already because it's like how many like what can we do now when they're already 

487.05 493.80 A: in their plan i mean you can't just go around especially when like when they don't have a clear picture like they didn't have a clear picture of the guy they were looking for or something 

493.75 494.97 B: mhm 

494.00 496.78 A: (( they were just going to run after everybody [laughter] )) 

496.07 497.19 B: i know 

497.50 503.67 A: and i think like the people like some of those countries that live here like people from other countries that are already here 

503.88 510.15 A: i think that more people are like even if they don't know like what nationality or anything they are i think they're just more like 

510.82 512.54 A: not like as open with them 

512.59 513.72 B: yeah 

513.85 516.54 A: just because i don't think i think people are just scared 

516.40 517.45 B: mhm 

518.54 521.36 A: but i think we really do let everybody in our country 

521.24 522.29 B: yeah 

522.45 526.10 A: like i mean whatever the green card is however long they get to stay here 

525.97 526.81 B: uh-huh 

526.48 531.51 A: but at least i mean giving them out to like people i mean i know they have to pass like some kind of skill but 

531.83 532.69 B: (( um )) 

532.85 533.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

532.90 536.55 A: it's still kind of scary that they can just let all kinds of people in 

536.72 540.25 A: and you never know like you know how many terrorists you're letting in with that 

539.70 541.33 B: (( [noise] yeah [cough] )) 

543.89 547.48 A: because like i don't think like for instance england i don't think they just let anybody in 

548.44 552.98 B: they how do do they screen them and all that first 

551.89 556.59 A: probably i mean yeah i think they should have a better screening process on who we're letting into the country 

556.36 558.01 B: yeah 

558.26 563.64 A: like there has to be some like thorough stuff going on like not like just like answer a skill question or something 

563.07 564.44 B: (( mm mhm )) 

563.70 567.72 A: like they used to do like thorough background test and stuff or whatever else they can do 

569.49 576.34 B: i i was also just thinking how um i guess around the time after 

576.23 586.81 B: september eleventh um i guess you know president bush was trying to find osama bin laden but like now they're focussing on the war and finding saddam 

585.32 588.50 A: and and he just got away like we don't even have him 

588.43 590.38 B: yeah and it's like 

589.02 594.07 A: like and it's just not talked about as much any more 'cause they're now looking for saddam or whatever saddam 

592.94 599.74 B: yeah and it's like it doesn't mean that he's still you know he could still be on the run and planning 

597.79 599.89 A: (( but they could like team up they could probably like ))
