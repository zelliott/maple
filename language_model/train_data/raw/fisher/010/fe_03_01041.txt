133.00 140.01 A: and i wasn't the only one i talked to a couple of my friends and they were like i couldn't watch it either it was just too much cussing and i 

139.57 140.68 B: right 

140.69 145.37 A: mean like if there was some cussing i understand that that's just the way that you talk but it was just 

144.32 148.62 B: right if it was really defining the character that they're playing yeah 

147.28 152.04 A: right it was it was too much it was like it was stand up comedy

160.04 160.98 B: yeah 

160.76 165.27 A: and just the way that he was talking i was just i don't wanna listen to this any more 

165.10 166.16 B: right 

166.07 172.45 A: so i don't really know if i was offended by it i just didn't wanna hear that any more so i guess maybe i was offended
