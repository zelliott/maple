166.56 168.29 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

168.10 170.88 B: i don't appreciate that kind of humor very much 

170.06 172.60 A: okay so you're literally meaning bathroom humor 

171.52 173.80 B: [laughter] oh i am yeah 

173.01 177.96 A: anything that pertains to using the facilities okay 

174.50 175.40 B: yes

179.43 180.99 B: i don't mind that 

180.51 183.13 A: no i don't think there is anything wrong with that actually 

183.28 184.41 A: um 

185.41 189.56 B: and sometimes i think people get a bit carried away with with 

190.41 192.98 B: um what they find offensive 

193.23 194.19 B: you know 

195.73 203.55 A: [cough] ye- well it depends on how you mean carried away i know i get upset probably more than some people but i don't ever say anything usually 

203.85 208.77 A: i don't get in unless it's really obnoxious [laughter] i mean if ah 

209.01 212.16 A: [cough] like i i'm kind of offended by um 

212.70 215.03 A: sexist humor sometimes 

214.64 215.55 B: yes 

215.54 220.45 A: and i won't really say anything i'll just kind of avoid that situation 

220.35 226.83 B: now when you say sexist humor you're talking about women talking about men or men talking about women 

225.30 228.47 A: no usually men talking about women 

228.08 228.90 B: yeah 

228.66 230.00 A: yeah 

230.27 232.26 B: yeah i i'm that way too 

232.40 235.45 B: for the most part and i will speak up and say something 

235.08 239.22 A: you know and there's other situations that are similar to that that i would be um 

239.34 249.37 A: whether it's racial or sexual preference or or any of that stuff sometimes i would say something and sometimes i would just ignore those people and say i don't want to hang out 

249.86 250.42 A: (( [cough] )) 

250.73 251.65 B: yeah 

250.75 261.68 A: because i just don't see them as as enlightened enough to even get past that that level of stuff but then again sometimes that stuff is funny and i laugh at it even if i feel bad [laughter] 

261.76 263.81 B: right right 

262.56 272.26 A: you know i don't really have much choice if it's funny [laughter] a lot of times it's just not funny and it's really offensive when it's not funny 

265.43 268.23 B: [laughter] well 

272.33 281.44 B: right right and i'm trying to think i know that there was a a seinfield episode seinfield being one of one of my favorite shows 

281.07 282.14 A: right 

281.53 282.59 B: um 

283.22 286.00 B: [mn] and it aired once 

286.12 291.45 B: and they had to just take it right out they could never it could never even be shown in syndication again 

291.92 300.02 B: and it and i can't remember that some group found the humor offensive i can't remember what it was about 

300.29 309.75 B: um it was a minority group that found the humor completely offensive and i didn't think that they meant it in that in the tone that these people took it in 

309.40 310.39 A: right 

309.80 316.93 B: so i thought that they took it a little too far in in blackballing this particular episode because i 

317.37 324.23 B: i didn't see it the way they they took it you know so i think sometimes people have very thinned skins 

320.61 321.44 A: uh-huh 

324.51 332.29 B: and and they will say it's offensive when i think they're just looking for a reason to complain does that make sense 

331.84 334.90 A: [cough] well i i yeah i understand the ah 

335.41 336.91 A: looking at it that way 

338.32 343.34 A: i i see that happening less than some people do i think 

343.47 350.86 A: i see definitely there's some people that that that overreact but i also understand where 

351.28 355.51 A: you can't really know how it feels to be another person 

355.61 356.96 B: oh exactly 

356.30 369.37 A: you can never know that so even if it seems a lot to us it may be a lot and it may not be you know it depends i guess you have to talk to more people in that group really to find out how bad [laughter] it really is 

367.67 373.59 B: right but i take myself into consideration and and when things affect me directly 

373.66 377.67 B: i have more of a sense of humor about it even do you know what i'm saying 

377.29 378.50 A: mhm 

377.89 385.47 B: um and i and i don't take it quite so literally and and and and i can you know laugh it off and and i don't 

386.44 390.35 B: [sigh] i don't really see that it it affects me that much 

390.53 391.63 B: um 

391.98 395.38 B: so it's hard for me to understand that something 

395.42 407.79 B: simple and and i've seen a lot of different um situations where this has happened something simple has really affected someone and i can't see how it could really affect them that much does that make sense 

406.18 412.51 A: yeah yeah yeah well i i i agree in and there's some instances that i feel the same way um 

412.97 427.74 A: there're not as there're enough of those instances for me to to put a lot of emphasis on worrying about it i guess is what what happens and that just comes down to what your threshold is of when you get bothered by that or not [laughter] 

419.54 420.37 B: okay 

427.11 428.59 B: exactly okay 

427.72 435.30 A: and that could be different with every that could be so far apart from both of us and yet we still say we agree [laughter] but we don't even know 

433.30 434.11 B: [laughter] 

435.83 436.78 B: that's true 

436.60 437.71 A: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

438.85 441.23 B: so what else is offensive 

441.50 442.58 A: ah 

441.69 443.56 B: or what's not offensive [laughter] 

444.17 445.63 A: (( politi- well )) 

445.74 449.94 A: i'm thinking political humor but that can that's generally not offensive 

451.23 455.84 A: [laughter] i love people like chris rock that are just outrageous at times 

455.89 460.60 A: i think that's i don't find that offensive at all although i'm sure some people can 

455.93 456.80 B: yeah 

461.12 462.60 A: um 

464.53 466.58 B: i don't mind outrageousness 

466.59 471.03 B: but i guess this is where my mothering comes in 

470.15 471.87 A: [laughter] 

471.70 475.63 B: i i think sometimes things can be funny without having to use 

475.76 478.84 B: a lot of expletives and do you know what i mean 

478.69 490.62 A: um you know obviously some people can do it very well and as a mother i can understand completely but as somebody who's never had kids [laughter] sometimes that stuff is really funny [laughter] 

490.10 495.06 B: oh it it can be very funny and and in certain situations it is very funny 

490.79 492.23 A: and it 

494.44 506.96 A: see my father hates it in all situation he says it's just bad i just don't go i don't subscribe to that sometimes it is just way overblown and worthless but sometimes it's it's damn funny [laughter] 

503.85 504.66 B: right 

506.31 510.78 B: well in the right situation it can be hilarious but it doesn't 

508.63 509.41 A: yeah 

509.65 514.30 A: around kids obviously it's not appropriate in way shape or form 

514.47 515.32 B: no 

515.52 520.83 B: and it's becoming more and more prevalent in in any kind of humor even television [laughter] 

519.98 528.02 A: you know there's a lot of things that are becoming prevalent that's [laughter] that's offensive for the popular culture that's not really against any particular group 

527.80 528.57 B: right 

528.25 540.53 A: [laughter] i think the whole idea of just the w- teaching the way people behave which is a very different way than i learned and there is probably zillions of different ways but there're all different than mine 

540.75 541.71 A: um 

542.30 549.59 A: there's sometimes some there's some people that are just growing up fabulously and some people that just have no concept of 

549.95 552.74 A: of a life that i see that exists 

553.51 560.14 A: [cough] i don't think i can make any sense without getting overly specific and i don't think i can get that specific [laughter] 

558.21 559.15 B: (( [laughter] )) 

559.67 562.99 B: yeah i don't know if we can either i i kinda know where you're going 

562.50 563.65 A: [laughter] 

563.36 565.15 B: i kinda know where you're going 

564.18 564.74 A: (( [cough] )) 

564.88 568.04 A: it's weird it's weird i mean it 

569.23 573.78 B: yeah it's it's a it's a different ball game out there humor wise 

574.06 577.83 B: um than when i was growing up um 

578.12 587.74 B: you know when i was growing up it was the the seven bad words that you couldn't say on television was you know as as risque as it got for the most part 

582.94 583.95 A: right 

586.40 587.20 A: uh-huh 

587.42 587.98 A: (( [cough] )) 

588.18 593.47 B: and and now that is like a daily occurrence [laughter] 

592.58 599.37 A: [laughter] yeah that [cough] yeah i think they can use what five of them on t._v. [laughter] 

598.71 599.63 B: (( yeah [laughter] ))
