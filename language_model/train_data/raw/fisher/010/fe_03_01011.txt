3.25 4.94 B: hi noreen how are you 

4.35 5.99 A: good how are you doing heather 

5.42 10.23 B: good this is quite the interesting subject for ah you know my first call 

9.74 11.02 A: yeah me too 

10.67 12.25 B: have you done these before 

11.69 13.11 A: no i haven't 

12.65 13.57 B: okay 

13.96 17.34 B: i guess ah well i'll start it off um 

16.10 17.05 A: okay 

17.88 25.91 B: you know whether or not people would remain calm i mean i definitely don't think so i think that's already been proven um 

22.29 23.30 A: mhm 

25.97 35.92 B: you know when when i'd heard that the security council had come out with some ah big terrorist thing gosh when was it about a month ago and they were saying that you had to run out and buy 

35.97 44.78 B: plastic sheeting for your windows and duct tape and all that i mean you know people were just mobbing the stores and you know buying up all the stuff that they had and 

37.62 38.77 A: mhm 

44.85 46.49 B: i don't know um 

46.59 48.80 B: kind of freaked me out a little bit 

48.26 49.35 A: yeah 

49.14 53.24 B: you know i i i figure it's something that's definitely 

53.39 57.46 B: going to happen i mean i really do see it in the cards but 

57.64 61.59 B: i don't know if i would freak out or not how do you feel about that 

61.44 66.99 A: um i agree with you i would say that people will would definitely freak out if we had another 

67.15 73.58 A: another terrorist um action the one thing i mean i definitely go back to nine eleven and i think about how it 

73.63 83.17 A: that was a major terrorist action against us and our country just fell to pieces and we're still paying for it our economy is still in the pits 

76.58 77.64 B: right 

79.21 80.36 B: mhm 

82.90 85.49 B: i'm still out of a job [laughter] 

83.93 87.09 A: yeah are you really wow 

87.12 88.16 B: yeah 

87.62 92.38 A: um so as far as what would people stay calm i don't think people would stay calm 

92.13 94.93 B: yeah yeah i mean it it's really it's a 

95.20 102.11 B: gosh this is just the worst subject to have to talk about for this first thing i thought they were going to talk about like consumer stuff but um 

97.59 101.16 A: (( [laughter] i know yeah )) 

102.72 113.14 B: i guess i didn't i didn't flip out when i heard about the thing with the plastic sheeting and everything like that i guess i guess the one thing that i'm thinking about more than anything is um 

113.27 125.53 B: you know people get so upset and they say that the government hasn't told them enough and and they're not giving out enough information and you know what i'm grateful for the lack of information that's given if you will because 

116.94 118.28 A: mhm 

125.33 132.93 B: if we heard of every single little thing that came across their desks the f._b._i. the c._i._a. and everybody else 

132.98 146.27 B: we would be in a constant state of panic i mean we couldn't handle it because you know a lot of it is unsubstantiated and a lot of it they catch anyway so there's really no need to send us into a state of panic if it's not necessary 

135.11 136.20 A: right 

136.33 137.63 A: right 

144.27 145.27 A: mhm 

146.14 151.00 B: um like that plastic sheeting thing it turned out to be a scam i mean it wasn't true 

150.85 152.00 A: right 

151.03 156.02 B: but they did tell us about it and everybody ran out and you know did what they had to do and 

156.07 168.36 B: got so upset when it really was not necessary at all we never had to go through that you know so that's kind of a that's kind of a tough call too because everyone gets so upset with the government but as far as i'm concerned you know you really 

160.48 161.57 A: right 

168.27 171.08 B: there's limited stuff that i want to know 

170.66 172.38 A: exactly 

171.23 182.78 B: tell me if it's coming right now you know what i'll prepare for it i'll call my family i'll tell them i love 'em you know but but i don't i don't need to know all of it because i'm going to live in a hyper state of um 

176.55 177.59 A: right 

178.72 180.21 A: right that's true 

183.88 186.82 B: panic and i don't want to live like that 

184.48 185.39 A: right 

186.12 189.22 A: yeah and there's only so much that you can do 

188.84 190.40 B: yeah exactly 

189.39 192.16 A: in preparation for something like that i mean 

192.18 193.55 B: exactly 

192.98 199.01 A: when i heard about the whole warning for duct duct tape and everything else i the first thing i thought was that 

199.28 204.50 A: that it's almost like trying the government trying to scare everybody rather than trying to 

203.21 207.15 B: (( that's what i said to my husband [laughter] )) 

205.21 206.28 A: really 

207.07 209.44 A: i just thought it was ridiculous i mean come on 

209.19 221.68 B: yeah that is so funny i said that to my husband and he said well you know i don't think so and i said honey nobody wants to rally behind the president right now but if he actually showed that yes this can happen and it can happen today 

217.27 218.66 A: yeah 

221.57 222.66 A: right 

221.89 225.95 B: you know then people will actually go oh my gosh it's for real you know 

224.12 225.19 A: yeah 

225.61 226.62 A: i know 

226.15 227.57 B: oh that's so funny 

227.87 228.85 A: yeah 

228.26 229.87 B: that you would think the same thing 

229.10 236.11 A: [laughter] and even with him going out and getting the smallpox injection and everything else i mean i just thought that he 

234.00 235.08 B: mhm 

236.92 247.80 A: is kind of a little bit off the deep end i don't know it just doesn't really maybe it's my own denial but i just feel like he's kind of creating this state of fear that doesn't really 

247.66 248.67 B: (( well )) 

247.81 249.65 A: constantly hit us yet 

249.27 256.48 B: i think that it exists i mean i think the state of fear is you know has mirrored it i mean i know that 

256.60 266.63 B: you know looking at saddam just himself i mean he's scary enough i mean there's enough stuff that he is perfectly willing and able and capable of releasing on 

260.55 261.75 A: mhm 

266.80 273.06 B: the country actually on the world if he chose to but you know we're the people that he's you know looking at right now 

269.99 271.08 A: yeah 

272.65 273.81 A: right 

273.11 281.40 B: and it's definitely possible that he could do it tomorrow and you know it wouldn't surprise me if the man's a lunatic but 

279.81 280.91 A: right 

281.83 294.58 B: you know i think that probably what the president is trying to do in that situation is try to assuage anybody else's fears you know he's the leader of the country and we're looking to him for support and guidance and 

295.16 306.88 B: you know to be the backbone of our country and if we think that there's a chance that he could come down with something or be afflicted with something that otherwise he could prevent then he needs to go out and be sure that he prevents 

306.73 307.99 A: right that's true 

307.05 313.97 B: that you know what i mean because i didn't even know about that shot but i mean it makes sense to me that he would go out and do that to let people know you know hey 

314.07 326.60 B: as far as i can i'm taking my own precautions so you know don't worry that that i'm going to be affected you know because i'm trying as much as i can to keep that from happening you know what i mean 

317.07 318.19 A: mhm 

325.33 327.37 A: right yeah 

327.04 328.86 B: but i'm a big fan of his 

328.61 339.98 A: oh okay i hadn't well i'm glad i got to hear you say that because i always think of the other point of view of him just being hyper vigilant but he is really doing his job i guess and 

336.37 337.46 B: yeah 

339.44 343.58 B: as best he can i mean i wouldn't want to be him and there's no way 

340.37 341.71 A: yeah 

343.18 344.88 A: definitely not 

344.05 347.13 B: i mean i wouldn't want that job at any time anyway but 

347.14 350.53 B: now is definitely not the time i wouldn't want to be in that position 

349.05 351.53 A: yeah yeah 

350.98 351.83 B: but 

352.79 353.87 B: i don't know 

353.57 354.89 A: yeah 

354.31 356.79 B: what else do we need to talk about with terrorism 

357.13 358.48 A: um 

358.26 359.61 B: [laughter] 

360.59 362.04 A: i guess ah 

362.66 365.41 A: how have you been affected you said that you're still 

365.67 367.37 B: yeah out of a job 

366.73 368.19 A: out of a job 

367.51 376.50 B: well our company i worked for a wireless company and um they closed down the chicago location that's where i'm from they closed that down back in late august 

374.11 375.16 A: okay 

376.05 377.09 A: wow 

376.55 383.88 B: and um i did start a business after that but it didn't take off and so i've been looking for the last probably 

383.97 385.99 B: two months three months 

386.08 396.78 B: but two months more digilent- diligently so um yeah i'm still i'm still looking the economy's just so poor people are looking at to try and get me to take ten thousand dollars less than 

387.91 388.84 A: okay 

396.39 397.59 A: yeah 

396.99 400.98 B: than i'd worked for for the last thirteen years and i just you know 

400.54 401.63 A: yeah 

400.99 409.80 B: can't justify that but they think that in this state that everyone's in right now that everyone's going to come down and you know and take that that lesser money and stuff 

408.98 410.51 A: and settle for something 

410.20 417.77 B: yes so it's really affecting um the economy in that respect too people just think you know you're just going to go out and settle 

417.46 418.54 A: right 

418.01 425.07 B: um but then it's going to take me the next ten years to build up to where i was so i mean that's you know not an option as far as i'm concerned 

422.69 423.73 A: yeah 

424.53 426.89 A: yeah it's a tough thought 

426.14 427.91 B: i'm just kind of hanging out waiting 

427.50 429.09 A: yeah 

428.53 430.82 B: going on as much as i can 

430.09 433.11 A: [laughter] that's good yeah 

431.52 436.50 B: you know making contacts and networking and stuff like that so 

434.91 436.01 A: right 

436.16 437.06 A: (( right )) 

437.02 441.30 B: so how about you do you have children or anything that are affected by this 

440.56 442.11 A: no um 

442.12 447.42 A: i'd say probably the people who are affected most would be my family i have actually i have 

447.86 452.33 A: my dad's from pakistan and we have family who are in pakistan and my 

451.72 452.73 B: (( mm )) 

452.52 457.19 A: and i have some cousins who are at the border of afghanistan and pakistan 

457.01 458.35 B: oh wow 

457.33 459.01 A: right after nine eleven 

458.97 460.22 B: oh my gosh 

460.07 463.78 A: so we were all pretty nervous about that and then um 

465.17 468.22 A: and my sister was especially nervous too she's still in high school 

467.86 469.77 B: mhm oh my gosh 

468.42 469.21 A: so 

469.42 471.29 A: she gets a little bit of um 

471.57 474.68 A: probably the most anxiety in our family about 

474.69 478.58 B: did she have a problem with with bigotry and stuff after that 

478.00 482.23 A: no not really because we're half caucasian so we don't really look very 

481.37 482.43 B: okay 

482.39 483.59 A: middle eastern 

483.21 484.23 B: okay 

483.70 485.94 A: so she didn't have any problems with that 

485.32 486.68 B: oh thank goodness 

486.10 487.51 A: yeah 

486.80 489.89 B: because that's just you know you are an american i mean 

489.65 490.65 A: right 

490.27 493.72 B: what does any of that matter you know you weren't there 

491.74 492.75 A: right 

494.14 499.36 A: right and back to the topic i guess you know [laughter] with people 

494.67 495.70 B: so 

496.46 497.29 B: (( [laughter] )) 

499.44 503.56 A: freaking out after the terrorist attack there was plenty of anti 

503.79 507.34 A: anybody who had any sort of middle eastern look whether they were 

507.48 516.39 A: you know pakistani afghani anywhere from the middle east even if they were indian and not even the same religion everybody was not everybody but there was some 

509.38 510.41 B: right 

513.22 514.18 B: mhm 

517.21 518.23 A: major 

518.73 520.72 A: prejudice against people from 

521.50 527.53 B: oh definitely i worked i worked with a gentleman from where is he from i think he was from pakistan 

521.55 523.31 A: those backgrounds 

527.76 534.28 B: and um i had asked him you know what what his take on that was how he'd been affected by it because i'd heard a lot of things 

534.23 543.68 B: about people freaking out and he had said that his wife had encountered some things um because she's from the country too and so she you know still wears the whole 

538.92 539.98 A: (( oh right )) 

543.86 552.19 B: ensemble and everything and so she was at the mall i guess with his two young daughters and you know people just giving her jeers and stares and stuff like that 

544.86 545.96 A: right 

550.49 552.56 A: oh yeah 

552.35 553.52 B: but um 

553.83 555.77 B: yes so i can just imagine 

555.48 556.95 A: yeah 

556.36 558.07 B: (( but do they )) 

558.37 564.07 B: shut the call off do you know when it's over because i was checking the clock and it has been ten minutes 

560.68 562.31 A: i don't know 

563.50 564.93 A: it has been okay 

564.50 568.28 B: um it said on the thing to be on at least eight minutes 

567.70 568.77 A: right 

568.60 569.91 B: (( um i )) 

569.14 571.20 A: i don't know i'm not really sure 

569.99 573.82 B: don't know maybe we should just talk for two more minutes just to cover our 

573.58 574.65 A: okay 

574.03 578.83 B: backsides if you can think of any more things that you want to talk about about terrorism 

574.89 576.22 A: yeah 

578.54 579.83 A: um 

580.87 586.11 B: what is the one single most ah what is the single most frightening 

586.27 588.85 B: terrorism act that you could even imagine 

589.83 590.72 A: (( um )) 

590.85 592.35 B: to me it's chemical 

592.51 594.66 A: yeah i would have to say 

596.31 597.45 A: um
