188.04 191.14 A: yeah it's been a long time since i've seen uh-huh 

188.83 191.17 B: but some of them go over the line a little

211.23 212.05 B: mhm 

213.66 221.69 B: well that's interesting yeah i think i think i draw the line when it comes to like if someone is insulting 

221.98 232.24 B: a certain group or if they get too sexual you know and it's to me it's it's embarrassing and it's vulgar and it's not funny anymore 

231.87 233.53 A: that's right i 

232.69 238.25 B: you know especially especially some of the male comics that that tend to do 

238.97 241.48 B: do that kind of comedy about women 

242.25 245.07 B: that's sometimes they can be offensive 

244.81 247.16 A: right it ah it can be 

247.34 249.21 B: it's demeaning yeah 

247.55 255.67 A: out of yeah it's ah it's just ah it's it's not even funny any more when it gets to that point and 

249.23 251.24 B: it goes beyond funny 

254.70 258.41 B: right i agree i it's it just goes to 

258.61 261.66 B: you know goes to being demeaning and not funny 

261.46 263.40 A: i think that 

261.91 269.34 B: and that's the main that's really the main thing you know where i would draw the line pre- because i pretty much other than that you know 

264.66 265.62 A: mhm 

269.75 277.32 B: anything goes but i don't and i don't see that you know how men always think the three stooges are the funniest thing ever

277.58 279.11 B: i don't get it 

278.45 282.05 A: [laughter] it's because it's stupid comedy probably

364.25 365.27 A: (( [mn] )) 

366.94 369.18 A: i think it's just mainly 

367.67 371.46 B: what conclusions they want us to come to i guess they want our opinions 

371.54 380.86 A: i i don't think it really ah i think it's just a a topic for us to be able to talk the eight to ten minutes it doesn't really matter ah 

371.89 373.98 B: and if we agree or not or 

380.95 389.22 A: what the conversation all is about except they do talk about getting staying on the topic as much as we can so i'm not sure 

387.35 390.16 B: right right about comedy and 

389.33 391.42 A: yeah but

433.51 434.69 A: yes 

436.07 447.71 B: oh i think that um i don't know i do like to laugh and i do tend to find humor in pretty much any situation even a serious one i always i always tend to look for 

447.90 451.88 B: the you know the lighter side of it and something funny 

452.19 455.47 A: well it's certainly a a more he- 

453.19 456.52 B: to break the break to kinda break the tension i guess 

456.22 463.39 A: sure it's a more healing form of ah living too i'm sure to be able to laugh things off and ah 

463.02 464.70 B: mhm i think so too 

463.75 468.64 A: ah to and to see the brighter side i think it goes hand in hand with that that ah 

468.50 480.53 A: if you look for something bad in people we can find it but if you look for something good and something funny about them that you like and they're fun to be around then ah hey that's that's what i like [laughter]
