2.37 4.54 B: hello my name is jack loy 

4.56 6.83 A: [noise] hiya my name's jenny nelson [laughter] 

6.59 7.85 B: jenny is it 

7.66 9.03 A: yeah 

8.50 9.80 B: hi jenny 

9.29 10.78 A: [noise] hi how are you 

10.68 11.93 B: just fine i 

12.44 16.60 B: understand the topic that we're supposed to be talking about is terrorism 

16.52 17.91 A: mhm 

17.24 25.59 B: and specifically how we think people would respond or react whether they'd be panicky or whether they would remain calm 

25.63 26.58 A: (( mhm )) 

27.17 29.12 A: um so what do you think 

29.21 29.77 A: (( [sigh] )) 

30.14 37.64 B: well i i'm sure it depends on the situation and the severity of ah whatever the terrorism would be 

37.38 38.63 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

37.93 38.98 B: (( ah )) 

39.19 47.12 B: it's i guess it's impossible to predict exactly how somebody would react or respond ah i'm a rather 

47.24 51.09 B: conservative calm type of individual 

50.70 52.15 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

51.35 59.60 B: i think i would remain ah calm to a certain extend and hope i could ah accomplish something by being calm 

60.14 62.38 B: ah on the other hand 

62.58 66.23 B: my guess is most people would not be calm i 

66.38 68.93 B: i've seen all kinds of ah 

69.23 76.56 B: ah news casts about the world trade center situation and obviously most of those people weren't calm 

76.30 77.76 A: yeah 

77.12 81.73 B: and i i suppose i wouldn't have been very calm either had i been in that situation 

81.85 94.86 A: yeah i i think um if we have more terrorist attacks people i i know myself i would remain calm but um just i was at campus when the world trade center went down everybody was [noise] just like freaking out so 

93.90 95.78 B: sure sure 

94.95 96.41 A: [laughter] so um 

96.68 98.41 A: i don't know [noise] i guess it 

98.52 101.25 A: usually what people believe is you know 

101.65 102.51 A: um 

102.65 105.07 A: affects [noise] how they will react in certain 

105.74 107.78 A: certain um circumstances 

109.06 111.20 A: but um yeah it's scary 

111.84 113.56 B: i believe that ah 

113.58 118.37 B: ah again depending on the absolute situation if you were in a 

118.36 121.94 B: airplane or something and there were terrorists aboard 

121.89 134.94 B: you you probably would react differently than ah if you were in on the streets or in a mall or something like that i'm sure that ah ah you would react differently i don't know exactly how you would react 

124.38 125.63 A: yeah 

134.98 147.99 B: i think if i were in a mall or in a situation like that i would i would ah certainly try to do something about it ah if you're in an airplane i think you have to evaluate what your chances are or 

135.62 136.32 A: [noise] 

142.90 144.35 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

148.29 151.48 B: perhaps overtaking somebody or 

151.60 154.52 B: or who's involved and what they're gonna do 

154.22 155.82 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

154.74 161.10 B: so i you know i think the situation dictates how you would react or respond to any situation 

161.27 166.20 B: i i do not believe that very many people would be calm about it 

166.32 169.23 A: yeah me neither [laughter] mm 

166.50 167.35 B: (( ah )) 

168.39 172.54 B: i was just in a situation within the last month or so 

172.82 183.92 B: where ah i was in a public place and and ah one one person physically attacked the other person over a relatively minor ah a minor incident 

184.37 191.33 B: and i was i was very close by and actually was ah involved in breaking up the fight 

191.32 199.79 B: but there were probably twenty five people around ju- that just sat there and looked at the situation without taking any action whatsoever 

199.91 200.86 A: yeah 

199.99 202.87 B: and that really surprised me that ah 

203.23 213.57 B: that that's certainly not terrorism or anything even close to it but there were an awful lot of people who who made no attempt to get involved and and do anything about it 

213.09 214.49 A: (( [noise] )) 

213.58 221.56 B: i was both disappointed and and surprised that that was their er way of not dealing with the situation 

221.80 224.26 A: yeah yeah there was a um 

224.27 229.50 A: an incident kinda like that happened by me where a guy was shot while pumping gas 

229.17 230.11 B: really 

229.58 237.03 A: and there was like three other people outside that saw the whole thing and everyone just went about their business and nobody went over to help him out or anything 

236.33 237.90 B: huh huh 

238.11 245.97 B: again not directly ah to the issue of terrorism but it it's really ah surprises me also that 

246.11 249.97 B: er several people can see the same situation and and 

249.98 266.23 B: report totally different things like people weren't even in the same area eye witness reports will say well this is what happened well no that's not what happened so that a- again in a terrorist situation i'm sure people that would get excited and and if y- 

251.93 252.96 A: oh yeah 

266.23 267.19 B: you tried to 

267.33 273.73 B: repeat or report on what happened you'd get totally different ah eye witness viewpoints 

271.06 272.38 A: (( yeah that's correct )) 

274.47 276.16 A: yeah that's true [laughter] [noise] 

276.25 280.52 B: i think the other thing that goes through my mind is in in um 

280.80 290.18 B: the way that we've been brought up in this country we haven't really had any ah need to think very much about terrorism or 

290.19 295.59 B: or protect against it or plan for it in the eventuality that it did happen 

295.70 305.58 B: and ah obviously other people in other parts of the world have have had to er live with this and endure it it for some period of time 

305.70 313.89 B: ah just recently when people came out and said well how are you going to protect yourself in the event of a terrorist attack 

313.91 314.94 A: mhm 

314.07 319.51 B: and my my response was i don't have the slightest idea what i would do or how i would do it 

318.21 320.70 A: because you don't know exactly what's [noise] going to happen 

320.34 323.98 B: no you don't and can you really protect yourself 

324.12 326.46 B: ah i live in an area where 

326.60 331.92 B: ah i can't believe that we would be very high on a on a target list 

331.54 332.89 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

332.17 337.69 B: but i can't think of anything that i would or should be doing to protect myself against something that ah 

337.11 338.96 A: mhm 

337.96 339.24 B: that would happen 

340.70 343.11 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

342.36 352.55 B: so those those are the kind of thoughts that than run through my mind and ah i guess that you never know how you're gonna respond until 

352.42 353.23 A: you're 

352.48 359.66 B: the situation actually occurs you know we can say that yeah we'd remain calm but but ah 

354.93 356.15 A: yeah 

359.78 362.87 B: how do you really know how you would respond or react 

363.00 365.31 A: exactly [laughter] 

363.54 375.93 B: ah i'm i'm calm in other kinds of situations and and in situations where other people seem to be very excitable ah er i'm not excitable to that degree at all so 

375.89 381.00 B: i think from my past experience of knowing myself i'd probably be reasonably calm 

377.72 378.54 A: (( [noise] )) 

381.50 384.17 B: i think i would try to do something ah 

384.47 390.43 B: and i'm not sure what but i don't think i would just sit back and let something take place 

386.37 387.05 A: (( mhm )) 

388.80 389.86 A: and watch 

390.99 393.32 B: without making an attempt to do something 

395.35 396.76 A: (( yeah )) 

396.79 397.88 A: i don't know 

398.88 399.96 A: so do you think 

399.13 410.46 B: well i think i think the other thing is you have to evaluate you know what what can you do what should you do and these things happen in a split second er going back to that situation where there was a 

410.49 417.98 B: there was a somewhat little skirmish that turned into a fight it was a decision that was made in a matter of a second or two 

413.45 414.88 A: (( mhm )) 

418.10 424.04 B: and er sometimes your emotions take over and you do just do what you think you have to do 

424.39 425.53 B: (( ah )) 

425.54 434.01 B: and and again it just depends on different people's personalities some people just back away from the situation they don't wanna get involved they don't wanna get hurt they don't wanna 

434.11 437.12 B: do anything but certainly ah er 

437.19 446.29 B: that doesn't seem to be a very logical thing to do either you you try to do something you try to take care of the situation at hand whatever it might be 

445.35 445.95 A: (( mm )) 

449.00 450.15 A: yeah 

452.27 454.30 A: [sigh] um so 

454.66 458.52 A: [noise] yeah what do you think we're going to have many terrorist attacks with 

458.07 460.29 B: oh golly i hope not ah 

460.59 474.97 B: i think that i think that our government is doing everything they can to try to identify those who might be involved and ah do something on a preventative basis and i'm sure that they have done many of those things already 

469.48 470.56 A: (( ah )) 

475.20 476.15 B: (( ah )) 

477.13 481.12 B: you you have to believe that there are those out there those terrorists who 

481.18 488.81 B: don't like our way of life and don't like our freedoms and ah are going to do everything possible to disrupt it and and hurt us ah 

486.48 488.33 A: (( [laughter] )) 

488.92 492.11 B: there's all kinds of hate americans around and 

489.04 490.34 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

491.38 493.13 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

492.36 498.58 B: and ah you know i don't we're fully capable of comprehending why they hate us to the degree that they do 

493.54 494.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

498.45 499.95 A: yeah [noise] 

498.82 501.34 B: but but it's certainly obvious that they do 

500.32 501.14 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

501.89 504.19 B: and that that's sad 

504.33 506.71 B: but i think it's a fact of life er 

506.91 515.91 B: we have things that they don't either understand or appreciate or are envious of or jealous of i don't know maybe some or all of those things 

515.79 517.11 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

516.37 517.76 B: but we ah 

517.95 519.38 B: we have been 

519.67 523.75 B: so fortunate to live in this country and be protected by our 

523.89 532.85 B: er by our freedoms and and er by our democracies and other people around the world just don't get it they don't understand that so 

532.69 534.53 A: [noise] yeah 

533.55 539.20 B: i think that that's just the way it is and i think we have to do everything we can to prevent 

539.47 541.40 B: ah terrorists from 

541.63 546.54 B: from doing things that do in fact disrupt our our way of live and our freedoms 

547.41 548.74 A: yeah 

548.14 552.05 B: and i think we are to a great ex- extent as we possibly can 

552.57 562.20 B: the thing you hope that we don't get so blase that ah we we don't heed the warnings of of government you already hear well what specifically are they gonna do well 

562.24 565.54 B: you know we don't know specifically what they're gonna do or 

565.56 567.55 B: we've got thousands 

565.84 568.24 A: yeah that's the scary part [noise] 

567.73 574.98 B: well we've got so many you know thousands and thousands of targets that ah as soon as you let your guard down er 

572.02 573.06 A: (( yeah )) 

575.26 581.36 B: er they might do something and these these people seem to be willing to just lay in the weeds forever until 

581.38 595.67 B: until they spot a soft spot or a weak spot and and then go after it and unfortunately our freedoms have protected these people to a great extent by letting them come into our country and and ah you 

590.27 591.17 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

591.80 593.02 A: oh yeah 

595.98 599.89 B: know the things that have made us so good and so strong are also things that
