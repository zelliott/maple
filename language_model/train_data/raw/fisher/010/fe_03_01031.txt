72.38 80.86 B: and he talks about how his mother was across town and he was at school and there was no way for them to get to each other or communicate with each other for hours and hours 

80.90 81.62 A: oh man 

81.76 85.28 B: and he came out of the school and the the city was just in you know 

85.50 96.99 B: shambles it was just awful buildings had fallen down all around them and they spent three hours in that school waiting to see if anything was going to be left when they came out so you know it's kind of 

87.40 87.74 A: wow 

94.62 95.38 A: oh man 

97.42 106.39 B: put the fear of god in me li- listening to that um we're just so used to having it so well here i don't know so what area are you living in 

103.21 104.67 A: yes that's true 

106.16 108.13 A: i'm in north carolina now how about you 

108.03 109.16 B: same here i'm in raleigh 

109.17 110.67 A: oh really i'm in winston salem 

110.54 118.35 B: okay um and i know we have the sharon harris close to us so i think about that once in awhile which is 

117.76 118.80 A: what is that that's close to you 

118.77 120.02 B: the nuclear plant 

119.82 122.61 A: oh i didn't even realize that (( i'm not that close to mount raleigh )) 

121.26 121.91 B: oh yeah 

122.38 124.60 B: yeah it's just about twenty miles from our house 

124.41 125.91 A: oh my gosh yeah 

125.14 128.20 B: and then they talk about fort bragg being kind of close 

128.90 134.25 B: although i did think about i thought you know there's very few people left at fort bragg when there's a war 

133.38 136.40 A: yeah that's true they just send them all out yeah wow 

136.47 147.27 B: but uh yeah i i'm not really sure how i would handle it i'm not sure if i would get in my car and like immediately go to get my daughter and just start heading out of town or what i would do 

147.99 151.43 B: that would that would be my first impulse i bet i would start doing that 

151.55 152.97 A: mhm yeah my little one he's 

153.09 160.26 A: five and he goes to preschool is all but if he was there i would just head down there to at least you know that would just i'd be freaking out i know (( i'm pathetic )) 

154.87 155.35 B: right 

159.42 161.09 B: yeah i i know 

161.70 166.14 B: and then i wonder if you can get gas once you're on the road if this sort of thing starts happening 

166.20 168.83 A: oh hm i try not to think about it because it's like if 

167.96 168.40 B: i uh 

168.95 172.49 A: i mean if there's a big thing that happens it's like where could you go to be safe you know 

171.99 172.63 B: right 

173.00 173.34 A: think i'd just 

173.02 175.29 B: d- do you really try not to think about it 

175.70 177.81 A: yeah i do try not to because it's like i'm just a 

178.03 181.33 A: panicked paranoid type person that if if i think about then i'll do 

181.54 183.68 A: be frozen and paralyzed you know 

182.70 185.60 B: yeah same here in fact i've um i've like 

185.84 188.51 B: not watched news as often as i used to 

189.11 191.18 B: because i feel like there's nothing i can do 

191.36 192.27 A: right it doesn't 

191.94 195.34 B: and it just sends me into a a panic 

194.87 199.77 A: uh-huh i'm the same way and (( wake )) because i mean i actually was working for u._s. airways when um 

201.25 202.14 B: oh really 

206.60 209.71 A: nobody was calling of course because everybody's staring at their t._v.'s and so i couldn't 

210.18 214.38 A: watch it until hours later when i got home but that was just man the scariest thing and that's 

215.14 219.41 A: you know you never thought it would happen here and now you never know when it might happen again so mm 

218.49 219.08 B: yeah 

219.36 220.29 B: yeah i know 

220.28 222.21 A: yeah so i always felt so safe 

222.08 224.28 B: oh i know that's the truth 

224.70 226.46 B: but i'm the same way i've kind of um 

237.16 239.41 B: keep listening to it over and over and over again 

239.41 240.94 A: right same here and i 

240.05 241.06 B: um and i 

241.36 244.50 B: i've also felt like from time to time that you know all those 

245.08 245.98 B: the alerts and 

248.57 249.36 A: yeah 

262.17 264.60 B: but i wasn't really sure if they had anything 

265.13 266.49 B: you know really substantial 

266.61 267.35 A: yeah 

267.02 269.93 B: or if they were just sending out warnings just randomly 

269.99 273.23 A: and that wouldn't surprise me who knows 

271.21 272.23 B: i know 

273.31 279.59 B: oh and i know we've had a lot of uh these peace marches lately and i haven't really participated in any of those 

280.41 282.27 B: um but i'm just not really sure 

282.98 285.63 B: if i have enough information to 

285.96 291.42 B: you know get involved politically because i feel like our heads of state must know what they're doing 

290.60 292.29 A: i sure hope so i know 

291.66 296.52 B: that seems like a silly attitude to take though doesn't it after vietnam and watergate 

296.67 298.98 B: oh 

297.83 304.02 A: yeah i used to work up on h- capital hill and stuff and my dad was really into politics and still kind of is but semi retired and i just 

304.39 311.31 A: i don't want anything to do with it anymore i mean i love washington d._c. but i'm so glad that i don't live up there anymore because then i'd be more scared you know thinking that 

310.63 311.13 B: right 

311.48 311.84 A: that's 

312.16 314.76 A: where everything was happening and oh 

315.22 317.38 B: see and i wonder about that i wonder if um 

318.37 320.66 B: you know if we go to war it seems to me like 

320.83 322.67 B: terrorism will just escalate 

322.86 323.63 A: that's what i think 

323.15 323.88 B: real bad 

323.77 329.54 A: yeah that's what i'm afraid of and it's like that's and i just don't i never understood wh- how war could solve anything but i don't know 

330.75 335.67 B: yeah i wonder about that i i feel like you know they keep talking about maybe this war would only last about 

352.82 353.61 A: mhm 

355.72 360.07 B: you know these people coming over and fighting a war but they can really hurt us in other ways 

359.95 360.65 A: right 

360.62 361.70 B: like through terrorism 

362.75 363.35 B: yeah 

364.14 375.01 B: i know and i j- and you know i wondered if my parents went through anything like this when i was a kid and just kept me in the dark about it because i do you ever talk to y- your son about any of this or 

374.76 380.87 A: well my my five year old he's actually not really understanding it he has autism and he's not (( this way )) he goes to preschool so he's 

378.12 378.50 B: right 

379.67 380.24 B: oh 

384.02 385.34 B: wow 

392.92 394.19 A: that was the only thing we ever had 

394.33 396.99 A: like drills in for school was earthquake drills 

396.57 398.72 B: wow yeah i remember that 

397.69 398.61 A: other than that 

398.82 400.51 A: i wasn't really afraid you know i didn't know about 

400.71 403.75 A: wars and stuff that much i- i'm thirty seven and i just uh 

404.20 407.69 A: i don't know i don't remember being scared when i was little but now it's like ah 

407.25 418.71 B: i know and see i want to protect my child from all that i i want her to have you know uh a real safe feeling growing up i figured it's it's the same with her there's nothing she can do so why worry about it 

418.68 420.02 A: right yeah 

419.95 422.64 B: but it's very frustrating to think that 

422.84 425.10 B: um you know we can be living in a world where 

425.20 428.76 B: she may not grow up and that's just awful that's an awful thought to me 

427.33 427.68 A: oh i 

428.83 432.74 A: definitely it's like ah but if you bring children into this it's (( this this uh )) 

432.76 433.37 B: yeah 

433.25 433.57 A: man 

433.91 434.64 B: i know 

436.07 440.10 B: yeah m- so i and it's funny because usually i'm 

440.39 445.40 B: pretty much the kind of person that just enjoys every single day but this has really gotten to me i'll it 

445.75 448.52 B: it has worried me in fact i've like tried to 

448.68 451.63 B: pull together more cash than usual 

451.73 458.24 B: you know thinking oh my god what if we have to do this you know we have to buy things on the black market what the whole economy collapses i mean 

458.69 459.16 A: wow 

459.92 460.42 B: but 

460.84 468.59 B: yeah so i'm just enjoying every day right now i thought i'm going to be really upset if something happens and hadn't gone to the caribbean this winter you know 

467.49 471.49 A: i know really it's just live fore moment 

470.67 476.66 B: oh i know anyway but we've been pretty lucky so far i i it's it's 

476.79 481.87 B: kind of strange to me that after n- um nine eleven nothing really else has happened 

481.99 482.63 A: right 

482.75 483.22 B: that's 

483.45 485.17 B: i can't figure out what that's about 

485.72 486.16 A: me neither 

486.32 487.10 B: um 

487.67 492.30 B: either our government's doing something right um or 

492.47 493.54 B: i d- i don't know 

494.22 499.61 B: you know i kept expecting a lot of things to happen after that of course that was pretty big what happened 

498.82 499.54 A: right 

500.71 501.50 B: oh well 

501.69 502.37 B: anyway 

502.92 503.93 B: have we talked ten minutes 

508.48 512.35 A: this is the first time i've done this i didn't do it last night or the night before or anything but i think they said um 

512.54 514.64 A: that it there'd be a beep or something that would let us know 

514.70 515.31 B: oh really 

515.22 516.04 A: so yeah 

516.11 520.70 B: yeah i haven't done this before either and it was s- that seems strange when i heard fisher i thought 

517.64 518.56 A: (( )) 

520.99 523.12 B: at first we were going to be talking about toys 

527.91 529.31 A: caller i._d. would say ten or something 

529.48 530.22 A: too and i was like 

529.84 530.31 B: yeah 

530.38 532.88 A: who the heck's calling me i totally forgot about it 

532.55 533.58 B: right right 

533.10 535.37 A: so i was on the other line i was like i got to go 

534.90 538.29 B: well see only responded today so i kind of was expecting this 

538.28 539.59 A: oh yeah 

539.05 540.02 B: so 

540.05 544.48 A: i told -em i could do it today tomorrow any time but friday saturday sunday 

543.82 546.22 B: yeah i wonder what this information's being used for 

546.38 549.91 A: i know i kind of wondered too i'm not sure i like the fact that uh 

550.23 557.92 A: you know it's only about a ten minute thing and then um plus they they put our names in for some drawing like a thousand dollars or whatever it was so yeah well good luck to you on that 

555.48 556.50 B: exactly 

557.80 567.96 B: that won't hurt too much i know it and see that's the other thing i start thinking about well you know terrorism is one issue but the way our economy's going it's just really not good at all
