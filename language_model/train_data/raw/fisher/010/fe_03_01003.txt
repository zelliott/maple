62.45 74.44 A: and what kind of attack it is like um if it's a bioterrorism attack or if it's some other kind of really big destruction then it might be more of a panic for people 

69.79 71.54 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

74.18 75.10 B: right 

75.58 76.76 B: yeah

92.85 100.41 B: we don't we didn't realize that okay are we in a war right now i mean nothing in our life changes so far but 

98.09 99.05 A: yeah

111.21 112.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

112.28 115.22 B: that would make such a huge difference 

115.35 118.35 A: yeah where are you located 

115.59 116.33 B: (( ah ))

144.53 145.34 A: ahah 

145.40 152.73 B: so a lot of automotive big automotive companies are here and they have their office here so 

150.35 151.10 A: oh 

153.01 156.38 B: um so there was some concern 

156.67 157.75 B: um 

158.32 160.44 B: you know a lot of people had to go 

160.46 164.24 B: to leave the building and stay out and also 

164.60 166.82 B: because of the bridge to canada 

167.01 180.50 B: being in detroit you know that um that was closed and a lot of people couldn't come back to the united states and a lot of people couldn't go back to canada you know people that commute to work because there was quite a few people that live in canada 

169.59 170.73 A: oh yeah 

180.50 181.41 A: (( ahah )) 

180.79 187.91 B: that commute to detroit that work in detroit and a lot of people that live in detroit l- work in canada so

188.18 189.55 A: oh yeah 

192.10 197.48 B: [mn] absolutely on september eleven you know we did feel you know oh my god what's going to happen 

195.79 196.59 A: right 

197.68 203.42 B: um seems like the time went by and now you know you just hear 

203.70 208.22 B: you know things here and there in the news and [sigh] you quite don't 

208.26 214.78 B: realize that it's really going on it's not only a movie you know it's just it's really going on although it's 

213.99 215.08 A: yeah 

214.98 217.60 B: not really affecting you direct 

217.72 218.88 A: right 

218.23 223.00 B: but it is sad you know the other day i was watching t._v. and 

223.30 227.54 B: just flipping the channels because it's really hard to really watch t._v. 

227.10 228.38 A: yeah 

228.63 243.21 B: and there was [sigh] [noise] just stopping on one [noise] of the channels there was this guy um [mn] ah he was um he was going to the war and he was head of the family and there was his wife was there and 

243.18 244.57 B: there were um 

244.67 248.45 B: (( i think old in her )) 

245.03 246.22 A: saying goodbye 

248.49 251.18 B: arms and and he was crying 

248.85 250.22 A: oh 

251.24 256.16 B: and you know she was saying oh he knows her dad is going and my not come 

256.08 267.71 B: you know so i was like [mn] jeeze i was just balling you know and crying my husband was like i'm not going war i'm like i know it's just you know horrible to think about it there's all those families out there that are going 

256.15 257.35 A: yeah 

259.42 260.68 A: (( ahah )) 

265.09 266.33 A: (( ahah )) 

266.75 267.80 A: right 

267.96 269.30 B: and 

268.79 279.81 A: right my husband is prior military uh he was in the army and so i kinda know what that's going like we didn't have a family at that time we hadn't started having kids yet but he did go to the gulf war 

270.93 271.96 B: oh is he 

279.47 281.64 B: oh oh my god 

280.14 283.44 A: and he was there for about six and a half months 

282.97 285.99 B: did he actually go in in combat or 

285.37 296.39 A: no no he was um he was more back farther than the lines he wasn't sort of towards the lines or anything but he was pretty close to where like they stayed in barracks 

290.51 291.66 B: (( just mhm )) 

292.63 293.63 B: right 

296.53 303.34 A: and just shortly after they had left the barracks the barracks were bombed so he was close but not real 

300.30 301.33 B: mhm 

303.56 306.23 A: hands on combat or anything like that 

305.56 306.82 B: mhm 

306.68 312.33 A: so but i was kinda thankful in a way now looking back that we didn't have any children at that time but 

311.40 314.54 B: right it does make a lot of difference now 

312.44 313.93 A: it's harder to think 

314.34 315.96 A: yeah 

314.92 316.47 B: yeah i know 

316.45 325.05 A: but it's a diff- it seems like with the terrorism it feels different than what it was before because with the gulf war there wasn't really much of a threat of 

324.93 325.94 B: right 

325.14 331.23 A: (( you know the united states being you know the united states soil being attacked and now it's different it's )) 

329.13 330.19 B: right 

331.08 331.97 B: right 

331.39 336.34 A: more our home and this may affect us more than just sending troops over you know [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

336.57 339.27 B: mhm and um i think what 

339.29 342.77 B: the terrorists had told us that [noise] it can happen any time 

342.86 344.17 B: anywhere 

344.61 345.95 B: in any way 

345.83 360.16 B: so that's what was scary [noise] it's not it doesn't necessarily mean that you know [noise] you are gonna hear the airplanes coming by or whatever and then there's gonna be bombs you know it can just come you know through chemical and you know um 

356.23 357.41 A: yeah 

360.24 365.60 B: different diseases different illness i mean who knows you know 

361.93 362.53 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

364.15 368.24 A: yeah right my husband was talking to me a little about it because 

368.27 382.07 A: of the scariness of it but he i was saying with the bioterrorism is there anything that we could do to help prevent that or protect ourselves and he said well really basically the only thing we could do is to get out of the area if we know it's sent to our area 

374.80 375.72 B: mhm 

382.19 392.03 A: and he said there are some bioterrorisms that like say if it's a disease that they could um that we can have an antidote for it or something you know to counteract 

388.30 389.23 B: (( mm [noise] mhm )) 

392.22 396.48 A: whatever disease that they're sending if we can try to figure out what it is soon enough 

396.91 401.49 A: and he said basically just getting out of the area and then time for it to you know 

401.57 402.96 A: evade the area 

402.53 406.79 B: ah yeah well that's a hard thing to do too [noise] 'cause i mean you have work and 

404.95 411.56 A: yeah right you can't just pick [noise] up a family and run if you were just you know a couple or something it'd be easier but 

406.99 407.96 B: (( you know )) 

409.02 410.22 B: yeah 

410.28 413.56 B: right it's not like you're by yourself and you can just take off 

412.46 414.95 A: (( right yeah )) 

415.04 424.24 A: but if it was a matter of our lives and protecting our children and keeping them safe you know at that point in time if it came to something like that i'm sure we'd be able to handle it a lot better than 

424.32 426.77 A: you know right now thinking about it [laughter] 

425.90 432.43 B: right right did ah were you able to contact your husband all the time [noise] when he was there or 

426.86 427.44 A: (( [noise] )) 

431.74 438.94 A: no no ah 'cause a lot of times he was like in saudi arabia and out in the desert where there wasn't phones 

435.86 436.68 B: (( ahah )) 

437.88 438.69 B: right 

439.52 448.30 A: so every every once in a while we did make contact which helped a lot but um when he was out in the desert there was not really a whole lot 

448.34 449.73 B: (( ahah mhm yeah )) 

448.85 450.41 A: (( of phones and stuff )) 

449.83 451.97 B: right and i remember in the gulf 

452.14 463.00 B: in the gulf war there were a lot of mistakes happen [noise] i mean it's in every war you know i mean places that had nothing to do with the war or nothing to do with [mn] being a target 

455.90 457.92 A: yeah right 

462.91 463.98 A: mhm 

463.07 469.55 B: end up being a target you know and that's what kind of scares me 'cause we don't i mean we live in a small little city 

469.45 480.07 B: you know in the suburbs of detroit and we don't have noth- you know we don't really have nothing but who knows if by mistake something happened here you know you're never really safe 

477.17 478.40 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

480.91 485.33 B: and my mom received an email like a month 

485.71 499.66 B: [noise] ago saying oh you know it's like i think a lot of people are receiving those emails saying oh you know prepare from this day to this day something's gonna happen blah blah blah you know and it's so hard and the email was saying you know for you to 

496.65 497.79 A: yeah 

499.84 503.87 B: save wa- you know go to the store make a storage of um 

503.89 508.57 B: make sure you have enough water supply and [noise] enough food supply 

508.81 518.94 B: and then it was just like so intimidating you know and i said i i'm sorry i'm not going to get into this because otherwise i might freak out you know 

512.36 513.86 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

518.57 519.85 A: yeah 

519.13 520.10 B: um 

520.47 521.66 B: so it's [mn] 

521.83 528.85 B: you know just hard you know y- y- y- you know that the you know that there is a fear but you can't live in a fear 

522.40 523.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

528.61 529.85 A: (( [noise] ahah )) 

530.25 542.88 A: yeah the panic [noise] like the question that we were asked about panicking do you think a lot people'd panic and yeah there will be you know just like you were saying [noise] the people that are emailing all those emails they're panicking already and nothing's really happened yet so 

534.83 535.57 B: (( [sigh] )) 

539.22 540.37 B: right 

540.46 541.47 B: right

557.09 565.70 B: now we have fears so many so many fears already and now you know we have a fear of having terrorists knock on our door pretty much 

561.37 562.15 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

564.93 566.37 A: mhm 

565.88 571.88 B: and [sigh] you know it's just so depressing and [noise] you know for sure that affects 

571.97 583.29 B: you know the children and they'll you know are brought up in this you know oh any minute now you know something can happen and i have to grab you on your arm and we have to leave everything behind

585.28 586.45 A: yeah
