2.75 7.10 A: hi would you commit perjury for someone 

7.50 8.33 A: close to you 

9.20 11.19 A: guess what i'm watching on television right now 

11.05 12.19 B: i don't know 

11.80 14.22 A: general hospital what this women's on 

14.57 18.76 A: the witness stand c- committing perjury 

15.60 16.52 B: oh ok 

16.89 18.77 B: ok 

19.47 20.27 A: um 

21.00 24.09 A: i actually think i would it depends on the circumstances 

24.32 26.19 B: yeah i'm i feel the same way that (( )) 

26.29 28.61 B: there could certainly be circumstances that i would 

29.40 31.89 B: feel close enough to someone that i would protect him and 

32.25 33.62 B: commit perjury for them 

33.79 37.10 A: i know the because the law is is vague in so many ways 

37.70 38.35 A: um that 

38.47 38.81 A: it 

39.80 42.21 A: to get an equal justice sometimes 

42.57 44.86 A: you have to bend the truth bend the law 

44.12 44.80 B: right 

45.08 45.54 B: right 

45.49 46.91 A: and i see that it's happening 

46.54 52.45 B: right and you know even when i you know watch some of the court t._v. or something like that there's 

52.68 56.09 B: instances where you find out about evidence that they're not allowed to 

56.23 60.78 B: use in a court case or something like that and yet it's known information 

58.63 59.36 A: right 

61.26 64.48 A: and look how the wealthy tend to get off from crimes 

64.80 66.04 A: crimes due to their 

66.29 66.98 A: lawyers 

67.25 68.61 A: who in turn like you said 

69.00 69.38 A: have 

69.57 71.18 A: evidence dismissed 

71.32 74.34 A: or bring in certain evidence just to ha- 

74.44 74.99 A: height- 

75.19 75.91 A: heighten 

76.21 76.68 B: right 

76.30 77.20 A: their theory 

77.56 78.09 B: right 

78.12 78.51 A: so 

78.61 78.98 A: i eh 

79.58 80.72 A: most definitely i would 

79.97 82.09 B: yeah i think 

81.10 83.00 A: a family member especially 

82.84 89.37 B: right i think so too um and i'm i'm sure they might be wondering if you would do it under oath and i 

90.02 95.36 B: i hate to say it cause i am a religious person but that might still be an instance where i would commit perjury to 

95.67 96.74 B: protect someone 

96.70 103.26 A: and me i'm so loyal to my government but i could still see myself doing it um (( )) 

97.87 99.57 B: (( )) 

104.06 106.24 A: circumstance is different in it's own way 

106.35 106.92 B: right 

107.10 107.67 A: so 

107.98 112.33 A: but um i mean i you know something i think generally we all feel that way 

111.67 113.68 B: (( )) 

112.80 115.44 A: because we've all had injustice done to us 

115.44 118.92 B: right um i think so 

115.76 116.97 A: would that be the reason 

119.03 126.08 B: cause i you know we think of certain circumstances for us that if something would have been said or done differently that it were to turn out in a different way 

126.15 127.12 A: yeah that's true 

127.13 131.51 B: and um quite often it's even as adult the little white lies are 

131.78 133.23 B: things that are there 

132.86 134.29 A: that's true that's true 

133.72 134.20 B: and i 

134.33 135.91 B: um i think there's a lot of people that 

136.46 138.74 B: perjure themselves on a daily basis even 

138.98 141.04 A: now do you feel different in 

141.26 141.54 A: the 

141.65 143.39 A: different areas that we are 

143.59 144.10 A: in 

145.12 146.29 A: more prevalent to that 

146.60 147.42 B: um 

146.61 147.19 A: you think 

147.53 150.04 B: i certainly see a difference in family loyalty 

150.29 151.18 B: um 

151.39 152.64 B: and like you said i think it 

153.15 156.63 B: i don't know if it would change from wealthy to poor though because i think that 

156.75 162.87 B: even someone that's in a poor economic system would feel loyalty to family and would perhaps perjure themselves 

163.19 165.71 A: right but when i was talking about the wealthy i'm talking about 

165.83 169.69 A: the resources they had to eliminate some of the 

170.19 170.98 A: material 

171.09 172.76 A: evidence like you were talking about 

172.83 174.33 B: right to get rid of things 

173.24 174.18 A: in that instance 

174.44 176.59 A: right um but like you said 

175.01 175.55 B: right 

176.73 182.70 A: the loyalty the love and the commitment to your family would determine how you would testify 

182.86 183.36 B: right 

182.95 184.20 A: it really would 

183.89 184.33 B: right 

184.51 186.54 A: i i know for my children i'll do anything 

186.58 188.63 B: right that's how i would feel too 

188.81 190.04 A: yeah and 

190.20 190.76 A: you know 

191.77 193.99 A: i grew up during segregation 

194.23 195.19 A: where 

195.63 204.10 A: i i think it happened more often but i don't think we've really come that far in the justice system to say that we've improved any 

204.27 204.76 B: right 

204.88 208.06 A: in our laws the laws never change basically 

208.20 212.12 A: we we wrote those laws since seventy seventeen seventy six and we stick to them 

212.31 212.77 B: right 

213.23 213.88 B: (( )) 

214.03 216.15 B: you know i think there's still a lot of 

216.29 217.48 B: concern from people 

217.71 223.45 B: about the justice system that you know like you said concerns them that they would get equal justice so to speak and 

223.57 224.75 B: certain situations 

223.59 224.06 A: right 

224.90 227.50 A: lawyers tend to make those gray areas get bigger 

227.52 228.15 B: right 

228.33 229.02 A: and 

229.45 231.01 A: we of the little person 

231.77 232.98 A: i i don't know if we 

233.17 236.41 A: tend to believe what our lawyers say is gospel 

236.85 238.88 A: and go in that direction 

239.31 239.91 A: or not 

240.24 240.68 A: um 

240.92 241.22 A: but 

242.42 247.57 A: uh i i was looking at a program the other day and attorney said i don't want you to answer anything i don't ask you 

247.79 248.30 B: hm mhm 

248.54 248.96 A: and 

249.66 250.96 A: that's negating the truth 

251.25 251.79 B: right 

251.82 252.40 A: to me 

252.48 255.49 B: right like the if they don't know it won't hurt them kind of theory 

252.86 253.28 A: so 

255.58 257.97 A: hm mhm so in a way you are actually 

258.68 259.56 A: lying 

260.32 263.63 A: to the court system you're perjuring yourself because if it's not asked 

263.99 266.46 A: you can't give that information you shouldn't give that information 

266.56 267.03 B: right 

268.45 269.71 A: i know i'm old fashioned 

270.64 275.36 B: yeah i think i am too and i you know even at my age like you said family is 

275.82 278.93 B: a strong bond for us and it's something you uphold 

277.51 278.01 A: yes 

279.03 279.43 A: oh 

279.53 280.69 A: always 

279.69 284.94 B: greatly uh it might it could be a little bit different for a friend you know especially if it was 

281.06 281.89 A: i know but 

285.10 291.73 B: something as serious as murder or a huge theft i'm not sure if i would do it for a friend but 

292.05 293.26 A: murder i think i'd 

292.06 293.66 B: no 

293.72 295.69 A: i think on the case of murder 

295.79 303.51 A: i couldn't do it because i know a life has been taken and some type of recognition and punishment has to come about on that one 

296.36 296.67 B: (( )) 

299.25 300.79 B: right (( )) 

301.63 302.78 B: (( )) 

303.20 304.50 B: right and that's 

304.62 310.58 B: i don't know that might even be something that you know i'd would have to consider about my child you know what 

310.14 311.13 A: right 

310.77 312.91 B: what would happen through that 

312.01 312.59 A: right 

313.08 316.51 A: and when we look at these court cases on television we're saying to ourselves 

316.61 318.73 A: that doesn't happen in real life 

319.37 321.17 A: and i i can't see that happening 

319.49 319.75 B: hm 

321.29 324.99 A: all these circum- situations they keep putting in front of us on television 

325.06 325.60 B: right 

326.13 329.25 A: i've i've never be- i well i've been on jury one time 

329.41 329.97 B: hm mhm 

329.55 330.83 A: and i listen to a case 

332.05 332.83 A: and 

333.24 333.85 A: i found 

334.31 335.71 A: the evidence to be 

335.85 337.36 A: believable to a point 

337.59 338.28 B: uh huh 

337.61 341.38 A: but the attorney just wasn't adequate to win a conviction 

341.72 342.23 B: hm mhm 

342.32 343.58 A: and it was a murder case 

343.72 344.33 B: wow 

344.96 345.47 A: so 

345.81 346.16 A: (( )) 

346.37 347.78 A: it it just depends on 

348.28 350.41 A: what your beliefs are and your convictions 

350.92 352.05 B: right no when 

351.20 352.33 A: how you would testify 

352.37 354.13 B: so when you guys were deliberating was it 

354.49 357.40 B: unanimous or not about the guilty or not guilty 

357.12 359.27 A: oh it was unanimous that he was 

359.44 360.44 A: um not guilty 

360.91 361.38 B: hm mhm 

361.08 364.24 A: because they didn't present a strong enough case and this was a district attorney 

364.45 365.00 B: yeah 

364.98 367.70 A: they sent a little young kid to present this murder case 

367.98 368.35 B: hm 

368.83 370.02 A: um 

370.87 372.47 A: they hadn't uh uh uh 

373.24 373.58 A: a 

373.78 377.33 A: reasonable explanation for every question brought up 

377.48 378.00 B: hm mhm 

378.27 380.23 A: and it's because they didn't do their homework 

380.60 383.69 A: and so many cases so many things that go to trial 

384.06 387.36 A: fall short of that that's why people tend to 

387.61 391.98 A: get past those gray areas so in a way a lot of people perjure themselves without even knowing it 

392.33 392.77 B: right 

394.14 397.77 B: i know so do you do you feel then that it's a general mistrust of 

398.23 399.20 B: our legal system 

399.50 401.64 B: that you would perjure for a child or 

401.77 403.26 B: perhaps your relative or friend 

403.78 409.04 A: uh not mistrust for the system but more mis- it it has to be the situation 

406.36 409.81 B: (( )) right 

409.31 415.29 A: it r- it really would for me um because i do believe in equal uh punishment for the crime 

410.93 411.50 B: right 

415.47 415.98 B: right 

415.51 416.22 A: i really do 

416.78 422.13 A: um so it has to be the situation i would take so much more in consideration with a family member 

422.28 422.94 B: uh huh 

422.86 423.41 A: um 

423.77 425.46 A: but if they're guilty 

426.14 428.66 A: i don't i don't know if i could live with it by purging myself 

428.78 430.05 A: to deeply for a 

430.17 430.55 A: very 

431.58 433.60 A: for murder or something like that how about you 

433.78 444.01 B: right no you know even if it was my child i think murder is something that i think they would have to be punished for um and not just for themselves to understand but 

440.05 440.49 A: right 

444.19 447.24 B: you know there's always somebody else is taught by the outcome 

447.43 448.22 A: correct 

448.17 451.68 B: um whoever is watching the case or involved in the case 

448.32 449.31 A: correct 

451.65 453.07 A: i feel the same way 

453.21 453.89 A: um 

454.03 455.31 A: true crimes have their 

455.63 457.14 A: area of degree 

457.24 457.75 A: um 

457.94 459.25 A: towards punishment 

459.91 461.26 A: but when you come down to the 

462.13 468.68 A: the nitty gritty of it we're all human and we we're all relied on each other and we have to keep the system as honest as we can 

468.91 469.47 B: uh huh 

469.20 470.50 A: even if someone else wouldn't 

470.65 471.05 B: right 

471.37 471.74 A: so 

471.87 472.12 A: (( )) 

472.31 473.68 A: i tend to agree with you on that 

476.00 477.55 A: so i hear a little one in the background 

477.39 481.69 B: yeah i i do day care oh 

479.35 482.21 A: well guess what i'm doing
