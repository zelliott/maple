61.44 63.88 A: mm you know like stand up comedy 

64.10 69.86 B: oh well now stand up comedy you can't really say much you could walk out i guess [laughter] 

69.08 70.38 A: yeah

73.80 74.99 A: mhm 

74.80 77.44 B: so ah otherwise the um

111.31 124.04 A: race and how they act and to me that's not that's not funny because that's their culture because if someone was to say anything about their culture then i don't think they would like it either

204.98 206.13 A: mhm 

213.47 219.02 B: like comedy i would think i mean it's kinda the medicine of life isn't it [laughter] 

218.80 220.44 A: i think so i mean 

220.89 224.28 A: [sigh] um everybody needs a good laughter 

224.02 225.13 B: mhm 

224.76 227.60 A: um but i mean 

227.93 230.55 A: some people don't use good taste

232.14 233.04 B: yeah 

233.32 241.51 A: yeah they don't use good taste at all and and all they're in for it is either for show or for the money 

235.21 236.72 B: mhm yeah 

241.57 242.58 B: right 

241.81 243.74 A: or um 

245.08 247.34 A: just to be seen 

247.60 254.74 B: mhm would you go to some of the like the laugh comedy places 

254.22 257.00 A: no i actually i've never been to one 

256.59 259.16 B: oh you haven't oh okay 

257.53 258.71 A: no 

259.01 262.22 A: i used to watch the stand up comedies that um 

262.42 263.86 A: are on television 

263.41 269.21 B: oh whoa that gets pretty pretty risque i guess you could say sometimes 

265.17 265.99 A: (( [mn] )) 

268.19 279.84 A: yeah especially the ones i used to watch um some of the ones on b._e._t. some of them were okay and some of them were were not because 

275.20 276.06 B: (( uh-huh )) 

279.97 282.63 A: there was comedians that would also 

283.26 286.40 A: um talk about peoples handicaps 

286.57 288.07 B: oh yeah 

286.79 289.75 A: now that's not funny i mean 

288.69 290.67 B: no i never thought that way 

290.61 292.10 A: right i mean 

292.66 298.44 A: they're er they're very insensitive when they talk about you know how handicapped 

298.51 307.14 A: you know how they walk or you know how they talk and i mean they can't help it that they were brought into this world that way 

300.78 301.90 B: mhm 

306.95 308.49 B: (( right [cough] )) 

308.60 309.58 B: yeah 

309.37 313.96 A: so i think that er when it comes down to degrading someone 

314.16 318.79 A: i think that should be a censored area that they shouldn't be allowed to 

318.91 320.06 A: talk about 

319.49 327.25 B: yeah even though we can turn off our t._v.s if it's on television but you know yeah i don't like the fact that it's out there either 

323.88 324.95 A: yeah 

327.18 328.67 A: mhm 

328.11 332.15 B: and um [cough] i get jokes on the internet i don't know if you've 

332.38 334.98 B: received any of those and i don't appreciate them 

334.82 336.82 A: actually i don't get um 

336.49 338.13 B: (( [laughter] [cough] [cough] )) 

337.16 338.98 A: i don't get bad jokes 

339.28 343.93 A: um i usually i get a lot of christian jokes 

343.70 349.94 B: yeah no tho- you know those are good i like those but then there's this one place that keep writing me and i don't know how to stop them 

350.16 352.47 B: you know i just kinda said stop 

352.67 354.90 B: writing this you know 

354.65 357.88 A: mhm did it have at the bottom where they where you can 

358.10 361.35 A: um unsubscribe yourself to it 

360.73 369.37 B: it might have it was like i was so offended i got out of it real quick and i deleted it [laughter] i mean after i made my comments stop doing this and i don't even open them anymore 

365.31 366.65 A: (( oh okay )) 

369.05 370.25 A: mhm 

369.63 371.11 B: so i don't know maybe 

371.15 378.27 B: i just it's almost like if i open it are they going to keep sending them and i probably should look for that where it says unsubscribe that 

377.86 379.18 A: yeah 

379.19 381.15 B: would probably the best thing to do 

380.96 386.76 A: because i remember at one time i used to get a little um a lot of little johnny jokes 

386.48 387.52 B: uh-huh

397.82 398.76 B: (( mhm )) 

402.28 405.05 A: i believed some of them were too explicit 

404.91 405.91 B: right 

405.68 407.59 A: for them to even write 

407.60 411.06 A: that a child does this and a child does that 

410.64 411.81 B: mhm 

412.04 412.92 A: so
