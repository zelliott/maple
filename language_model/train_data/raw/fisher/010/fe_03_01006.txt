1.23 2.45 B: hello 

2.02 3.31 A: hi 

3.20 5.86 B: hi [laughter] my name's sammy 

5.40 7.43 A: oh my name's tonya ramble 

7.72 8.62 B: um 

8.73 15.06 B: i i don't know exactly what we're supposed to do except answer the question [laughter] 

14.32 19.10 A: yeah well i guess the question was how if we would stay calm or 

19.17 21.81 A: would we panic during a terrorist attack 

21.59 24.55 B: i think it's just human nature to panic 

23.85 25.56 A: yeah i do too 

25.86 31.42 A: and you know we just i don't i've been thinking about getting some of these books you know that kind of tell 

31.74 41.27 A: you know what you need to do in case there is a attack but as of now i don't know i wouldn't know what to do [laughter] i think that's what would frighten me mostly you know is 

41.60 42.59 A: um 

42.68 43.81 A: i don't know 

44.57 48.80 A: you know how you could make a person safe or your family safe 

48.64 54.07 B: right well i know that we cover this a lot when we're in church 

53.91 59.81 B: and you know right now it's just more of a godly issue to me because 

59.63 72.96 B: um i feel that i need to be prepared no matter what happens because you know they tell you to tape up your windows but then they tell you that the brick breathes the sheet rock breathes 

72.73 76.34 B: and then you know when it comes to the gas mask um 

76.55 81.28 B: they're only good for an hour and then you have to take them off and change the filter 

82.49 84.17 B: so you know i don't know 

84.39 89.67 A: mhm mhm i just i don't think there's really a lot a person really could do you know i just think 

90.32 97.70 A: oh does anyone really know you know we've never really had to go through something like this to really know you know how bad it could be 

98.04 105.83 A: but i'm like you i think it's all so you know i'm a believer i'm a christian and i'm i believe a lot of this could be you know the in the time stuff 

106.07 109.27 B: i'm um totally with you [laughter] 

106.30 107.17 A: you know 

108.83 115.26 A: so you know i and that's kinda scary to think well maybe there well of course as far as war goes 

115.49 119.58 A: there again in the bible it says there will always be war rumors of war so 

119.91 120.88 A: you know 

121.02 123.46 A: you probably feel that way too or believe that way 

122.36 127.27 B: oh yes and you know the rumors have gone on for years and 

129.60 131.56 A: as far as like you know 

131.72 137.87 A: making us you mean like our time might be close to being an end you mean or what 

137.27 141.10 B: oh i think we're definitely in the end days 

139.87 141.98 A: (( towards the end yeah )) 

141.37 146.22 B: but you know who's to say how long the end days are you know 

145.31 148.63 A: according to god i mean how long yeah 'cause a 

147.62 149.10 B: that's right 

149.22 153.09 A: thousand years is like you know that's like nothing to him 

152.33 156.07 B: a minute [laughter] a second [laughter] 

153.41 154.51 A: [laughter] 

155.70 157.95 A: yeah yeah i i um 

158.28 159.77 A: i really don't know 

159.87 163.12 A: i think i would i would panic yeah 

164.38 176.48 A: if i felt i could be safe in some way you know like you could tape up your windows or whatever you know but then sooner or later you're gonna have to come out and as far as like now are we talking germ um 

176.62 179.77 A: or just everything or radiation 

177.83 182.00 B: i would assume anything's at hand 

180.48 181.56 A: anything 

181.94 185.43 A: because see i mean sooner or later you're gonna have to come out [laughter] 

184.74 186.24 B: that's right 

185.87 196.38 A: so you know how long you know you could maybe get your gallons of water and your food stored up for a while but pretty soon you're gonna have to come out of your safe you know your home 

196.40 205.19 B: yeah and we're on well water so you know what's to say that our water wasn't contaminated during whatever it is you know 'cause 

204.46 205.54 A: uh-huh 

205.23 211.71 B: they've brought up the suspicion you know because the west nile just popped up out of nowhere 

212.73 214.23 A: now what was that 

213.62 216.65 B: the west nile virus with the mosquitos 

216.00 217.57 A: oh yeah 

216.97 220.38 B: and you know they think that there may be a connection 

219.77 229.63 A: there could be i was wondering about that too that somebody could have brought was that sort of a foreign thing anyway i mean that was it was never heard of it in the united states before 

222.04 223.36 B: yeah 

230.04 235.61 A: have we ever heard of it in here in the united states before it was a fairly new it was a new thing 

232.84 236.08 B: i haven't and you know and then there's like 

236.59 242.28 B: when i heard it on the news it was like two thousand people you know were infected with it last year 

242.38 249.85 B: and it you know it just makes you wonder what lengths these terrorists would go to to you know 

249.87 251.29 B: hurt us 

250.91 252.08 A: mhm 

251.48 253.90 B: just because of our beliefs 

253.48 261.43 A: right and that's scary with you know they think they're doing the right thing you know like they're honoring their god you know 

261.97 263.79 A: they're you know that so it's 

263.82 269.86 A: the sky's the limit they could do anything to us because they're honoring god when they can hurt us you know 

270.56 275.49 B: yeah it's kind of a sick religion isn't [laughter] 

273.39 277.09 A: yeah it is i'm so glad i have no part of it 

276.45 278.57 B: me too [laughter] 

277.50 282.20 A: but how do you feel about not letting anyone come 

282.38 284.72 A: to the united states you know they've 

284.90 287.14 A: stopped all of that 

287.46 293.91 A: don't let anybody from the mid east come over here and go to school or whatever i know some of them sneak in 

294.87 301.23 A: but just to put a stop to that you know we've got so many people saying oh we can't do that you know that's not humane or whatever 

301.31 303.96 A: but it's not humane to have all of our people 

301.34 302.30 B: well 

304.60 306.14 A: you know die either 

305.62 308.44 B: that's kind of the catch twenty two 

308.56 316.96 B: because you know we do stand for freedom and a lot of them don't know that from where they're from 

316.97 320.68 B: so they come over here you know and you can't 

321.29 326.64 B: we didn't originate over here we came from england you know 

326.21 327.36 A: mhm 

326.90 329.17 B: and so i don't know 

328.64 333.53 A: oh i see what you're saying like if it wasn't i see like if 

334.25 337.34 A: it's like fairness or something is that what you're yeah 

335.61 341.20 B: right it's kind of hard to say that you can't come here 

338.13 339.02 A: say that you 

341.64 346.33 B: you know when we're originally visitors ourselves [laughter] 

344.64 356.22 A: mhm right right and it's i guess the indians are the ones that can [laughter] really say well this is our land [laughter] i guess they would have the right to to voice their opinion on that [laughter] 

349.50 351.62 B: (( [laughter] that's )) 

352.14 352.85 B: (( right )) 

355.64 356.94 B: yeah 

356.25 357.69 A: the american indians 

358.27 359.53 A: (( yeah that's a )) 

358.98 361.86 B: and there's so few of them left [laughter] 

360.85 362.21 A: i know 

362.99 366.12 B: but ah i don't you know it's just like 

366.51 367.94 B: a lot of people 

368.76 372.80 B: don't agree with letting the mexicans come across the border 

372.60 373.63 A: uh-huh 

373.08 377.66 B: but you know we do missionary work over in mexico and 

377.74 387.22 B: they have some really bad situations and you know they can't survive unless somebody comes across the border to work and send them money 

386.63 391.83 A: i see what you're saying so if we stop that then it's gonna be the same for every place you know 

391.42 393.14 B: yeah i think so 

392.64 396.19 A: or even our tourism you know to go travel into a a 

396.30 400.37 A: foreign country you know that would all be put a stop to too i guess 

400.26 402.97 B: yeah 'cause if you don't let you know 

403.04 407.48 B: their people in your country i don't see where they would let us in theirs 

406.08 417.82 A: right right so see how what you know i've never went overseas but well that's kind of a dream you know to just go visit another country i don't know exactly which one i would i mean i've 

410.42 412.33 B: i haven't either [laughter] 

418.08 419.91 A: kind of thought about it but 

420.37 428.70 B: well my brother's been to turkey and when i worked with a machining company when they used to go to turkey 

420.56 421.58 A: i don't know 

428.92 440.05 B: or even brazil you know they would come they would get off the plane and there would be people standing there with you know m16s and that's kind of a scary thought and 

436.30 437.62 A: (( oh no )) 

439.00 440.57 A: oh yeah 

440.01 444.67 B: then if you go to england there's always the threat of terrorism over there 

445.35 447.88 B: so i don't i think 

447.49 455.41 A: mhm canada may be safe [laughter] but that's not too far i mean you know that's not really i don't feel that as going that's kinda north america anyway you know what i mean 

455.00 456.40 B: oh yeah 

455.57 460.16 A: i don't think i that's not overseas i mean we're just kinda like one in a way 

460.25 462.77 B: yeah we're still on the same continent 

460.27 461.21 A: so i wouldn't 

462.17 465.88 A: yeah so i don't yeah that's 

464.10 464.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

465.11 466.35 B: excuse me 

467.40 468.37 B: but i 

467.56 468.55 A: well any- 

468.94 470.83 B: i don't know really 

471.36 474.26 B: what else to say but 

474.28 480.33 B: you know we all just need to make sure that our lives where they need to be because the threat of terrorism is 

480.82 482.42 B: reality 

482.48 483.84 B: (( and you know )) 

484.02 486.91 B: it's inevitable i believe 

486.12 487.04 A: mhm 

487.77 488.83 A: i know 

488.85 495.77 A: and it's the whole you know i feel it's a new thing i mean about ten years ago you didn't really hear of this you know 

496.89 497.84 B: well 

497.52 503.15 A: and well now talking about getting to the economy the stocks the stock market 

502.91 504.15 B: right 

504.56 508.02 A: i you know they say you can go kinda by history 

508.74 513.49 A: you know it would kinda let you know a lot of what's gonna happen in the years to come 

514.16 521.35 A: you know there may be five six seven years of bad like right now there's what three this is going on three years of bad economy 

514.20 515.07 B: uh-huh 

521.65 523.37 B: yeah i think i think 

521.99 530.38 A: but then they say well just wait it out maybe in three or four years it will start picking up again but you know this terrorism stuff is a new ball game 

530.30 543.43 A: so i don't know i don't know what to think about that this is new i mean someone can just bomb something and the stocks will go down for months and months and months you know and that i feel that there may not be an end to it you know 

531.90 533.52 B: i don't either 

543.48 549.09 B: and when i was younger i didn't even think about it anyway you know now i'm at the age to where 

549.23 556.70 B: it's something that i have to think about you know i don't know whether my children are going to be able to grow up 

552.51 553.62 A: mhm 

557.35 565.84 B: and find out what it's like to have families of their own because of these idiots [laughter] these suicide idiots 

562.87 563.94 A: mhm 

564.92 570.91 A: yeah you see there's no control over them i mean they get in an airplane and they kill themselves too 

571.04 571.80 A: you know 

571.13 572.46 B: no kidding 

572.23 574.49 A: it's a it's scary to think you know there's 

575.25 579.40 A: no value of life there human life not even for themselves you know 

578.68 583.07 B: and it doesn't matter if it's children involved 

582.48 588.41 A: no not at all it's like they're americans they're gonna grow up and they're gonna be bad you know we hate all americans 

586.72 587.89 B: yeah 

588.42 590.90 A: so there's no mercy that's scary 

591.17 598.55 B: 'cause i think you know even with the threat of war we've taken into consideration you know the innocent bystanders 

598.28 599.60 A: mhm
