58.77 60.70 A: that definitely makes a difference when you have 

60.28 60.82 B: it does 

60.91 61.44 A: family 

61.66 62.11 B: yeah 

62.44 62.90 A: right 

63.72 65.83 B: so and i tend to think most people would panic 

65.92 68.40 B: now everybody's on such a heightened state of alert 

69.32 70.74 A: i think so although i think 

70.91 74.79 A: you know a lot of people are all of us had had a little time to think about it 

75.54 76.00 A: um 

76.94 81.87 A: eh (( )) initially it would be certainly a surprise that i think because we had seen it happen before 

82.93 85.68 A: there's almost more of a feeling of expectation 

86.03 86.53 B: yeah 

87.34 88.95 A: so that i think maybe 

90.45 93.05 A: you know you i guess i have thought a little bit more about 

93.36 99.25 A: you know what would i do in this situation not necessarily knowing you know once the adrenaline starts 

99.10 100.30 B: yeah 

100.10 102.39 A: flowing really what it is you're going to do but 

102.89 104.67 B: right i've definitely tried to imagine 

104.78 106.75 B: what i would do in such a situation 

107.00 107.51 A: mhm 

107.17 107.63 B: you know if 

107.82 109.62 B: plane's crashed into the building i was in 

109.92 110.45 A: mhm 

111.51 112.45 B: and i guess uh 

112.59 117.25 B: i think hopefully that everybody's a little more well prepared now as far as the rescue crews and 

117.81 119.61 B: everybody wouldn't be caught as off guard 

119.86 120.40 A: right 

120.68 123.33 A: right i think so i yeah i just think that 

120.82 121.13 B: so 

123.79 125.35 A: (( any )) most people that i see too 

126.72 128.16 A: are expecting something 

128.46 129.18 A: course it's always 

129.52 131.20 A: going to happen to someone else 

131.60 132.55 A: but i think 

131.64 133.58 B: that's what you like to think 

133.34 136.80 A: yeah but i you know i still think there is that feeling of expectation 

137.62 139.62 A: but i think i wouldn't be as panicked 

140.08 142.79 A: at this point in time as i probably would have been 

143.30 143.96 A: before 

145.32 146.59 A: but of course who knows 

146.60 147.73 B: before nine eleven 

147.69 148.20 A: right 

148.48 148.92 B: yeah 

148.52 148.89 A: yeah 

149.73 151.86 A: i think because then it was totally unexpected 

152.14 153.99 A: by the general population anyway 

154.15 157.94 B: it was it was completely unexpected i couldn't believe when i saw it on t._v. 

157.88 158.44 A: yeah 

158.74 160.15 A: yeah i i agree 

159.25 162.27 B: and thinking it was just an accident when you saw the first plane 

163.06 164.79 A: yeah until the second one hit 

163.07 163.60 B: and then 

164.41 167.23 B: knowing when the second one plane hit that it wasn't an accident at all 

167.06 167.65 A: mhm 

167.76 168.50 A: exactly 

168.70 169.36 B: so scary 

169.84 172.68 A: but i guess today you know it just it seems like 

173.09 174.61 A: everyday you just wonder 

174.88 178.66 A: when the other shoe is going to drop because there just have been so many threats and 

176.61 177.04 B: mhm 

179.42 181.10 A: i guess so much talk about it 

182.00 183.77 B: and every time they raise the alert level 

183.97 184.72 A: mhm 

184.44 191.38 B: and then it ends up dropping back down and they have reports of possible terrorist attacks and then they don't happen it's just like it gets you so tense 

191.77 192.66 A: well it does 

193.22 194.02 A: it definitely 

194.49 196.26 B: just waiting for one of them to come true 

194.60 195.28 A: but i think it 

196.60 197.09 A: yeah 

197.33 202.30 A: you know you i guess you just hear about all these threats and that there just seems to be so much hatred that 

203.20 206.58 A: i mean there's almost bound to be something and and evidently they have foiled 

206.87 207.37 A: several 

207.51 207.97 A: attempts 

208.79 210.30 B: i know i heard about one here 

210.57 212.95 B: here in indianapolis where they stopped somebody at 

213.07 213.69 B: the 

213.83 214.42 B: airport 

214.58 218.09 B: who had the flight manuals that were similar to the ones that the terrorists had 

214.76 215.22 A: mhm 

218.23 218.77 A: mhm 

218.80 219.55 B: on nine eleven 

219.65 221.35 B: and they stopped them thankfully but 

221.64 222.65 B: gosh what could have happened 

222.89 223.76 A: well that's it 

224.02 226.13 A: you know and i think that there's just always that 

226.63 228.02 A: kind of that sense of 

228.84 231.96 A: of something or the possibility of something occurring 

232.25 232.66 B: mhm 

233.33 239.23 A: but i don't know i guess you know i just don't have i mean i have fear but not the fear that i think i probably would've had 

239.50 240.20 A: initially 

240.32 240.86 B: yeah 

241.84 243.74 B: i think we're all little bit more prepared now 

241.94 242.40 A: um 

244.40 246.26 A: yeah or at least expecting something 

246.99 249.97 A: you know that something is going to happen and i think if if nothing else 

251.62 252.98 A: you know it really 

253.49 255.42 A: puts you in a position if you're a person of faith 

255.96 262.72 A: to think how important is it do do i really believe what i say believe (( no )) 

257.67 258.11 B: mhm 

261.67 266.00 B: yeah it's important to have all your cards on the table as far as that goes 

265.38 267.19 A: yeah you know i really think 

266.11 267.34 B: in case anything would happen 

267.58 270.17 A: it makes you feel think a little more seriously about 

270.90 271.70 A: things like that 

273.04 273.48 A: but 

274.10 275.95 B: i've read on the left behind series 

276.27 277.16 A: i have too 

277.31 282.71 B: and oh gosh it's so scary i mean kind of the same thing not terrorist attacks exactly but 

279.35 280.11 A: yeah 

282.95 285.38 B: you know people being taken suddenly and 

282.98 283.55 A: right 

285.67 286.28 B: so scary 

286.39 288.20 A: well i think it's that lack of control 

289.14 291.45 A: you know i try to think we all of course like to have 

289.18 289.58 B: yeah 

291.61 292.19 A: be in 

292.42 293.21 A: in control 

293.96 298.16 A: and in control of what we're going to do or say or what's going to happen 

298.57 301.60 A: but i think when it comes right down to it we don't really have much control 

302.08 303.00 B: no not at all 

303.19 303.90 A: you know so 

303.38 310.59 B: i feel a little better now because they are catching people and because we're so heightened that it would be hard for terrorists to get back over here a little harder 

310.96 311.60 A: right 

311.48 313.88 B: but there's just always that nagging thought that they did it 

313.98 316.12 B: you know they snuck under our radar once before 

316.41 317.45 B: quite easily 

316.44 317.16 A: well and 

317.63 321.94 A: that's it and if you you know if you listen to the news and read the papers at all talking about these 

322.58 324.78 A: sleeper cells that supposedly are here 

324.81 325.22 B: mhm 

326.03 328.06 A: you know we're we're certainly not 

329.72 333.37 A: completely free of of any possibility of that happening but 

334.24 334.82 A: i don't know 

335.12 338.95 A: i think generally you know like a lot of people i think sure there was terror but 

339.16 340.25 A: even the firemen 

340.47 342.05 A: you know that went in to those buildings 

342.59 344.03 A: i mean they must have felt 

344.15 345.13 A: terrible fear 

345.20 345.63 B: mhm 

346.31 347.18 A: and yet 

347.99 350.35 A: they knew that panicking wasn't going to help anyone 

350.67 356.74 B: yeah at least they remained calm and and because of that i think a lot of the lives were saved that wouldn't have been otherwise (( and )) unfortunately 

352.77 353.38 A: yeah 

357.00 358.03 A: right and i think 

357.48 359.54 B: how many of them had to lose there's because they were helping 

359.66 360.45 A: well that's it 

360.64 362.37 A: and you hear about people that 

362.76 365.76 A: you know did stay behind and help other people or stay 

366.09 369.30 A: i think particular ther- wasn't there a man in a wheelchair or something and 

368.71 370.80 B: mhm and his friend who refused to leave him 

370.93 372.32 A: yeah and stayed with him 

372.77 373.83 A: you know so i think 

372.86 373.80 B: while the building collapsed 

374.60 378.81 A: oh that it's just hard to imagine but i think when it comes right down to it 

379.41 381.82 A: you know it's it's almost i guess you can compare it too 

382.19 382.70 A: um 

383.51 391.01 A: you know if there's an accident or if something happens to your child or you know they're choking or something all of a sudden this unexpected thing happens 

391.19 391.60 B: mhm 

392.60 396.01 A: you know i think sometimes it's sup rising just how you do react 

396.25 397.33 A: that when you know 

397.84 399.47 A: that you have to do something 

399.79 401.63 A: i mean that there's no one else there to do it 

401.87 402.27 B: yeah 

402.56 402.84 B: and 

402.56 405.37 A: then i think you just automatically do what has to be done 

406.33 407.66 B: and hope for the best 

407.37 407.97 A: yeah 

408.26 409.85 B: the anticipation's hard to though 

408.36 409.00 A: yeah 

410.38 414.69 B: like it's hard to go out it's hard for me to go out now too like i went and saw a play the other night and 

410.39 411.17 A: exactly 

414.86 420.44 B: just to be sitting there in that crowded theater and thinking you know what if something happened right now not necessarily a terrorist attack but like 

420.34 420.88 A: mhm 

420.69 424.11 B: the night club fire that happened and all those people who got trampled 

423.44 424.67 A: aw i know 

424.34 425.67 B: you know trying to get out and 

426.31 428.61 B: what if something like that happened what would i do and 

428.47 429.12 A: mhm 

428.78 433.94 B: you know trying to get a game plan on so i guess it's better now to be a little more prepared and conscious it's just that 

434.37 436.08 B: kind of hard to live in a heightened state of 

436.65 438.15 B: of constant stress and 

437.80 438.29 A: it is 

438.42 441.04 B: and anticipation of something that that may or may not happen 

441.33 443.79 A: yeah and i think we as americans aren't accustomed to that 

444.22 446.19 A: you know (( where as it )) in a lot of countries 

444.67 445.03 B: right 

446.45 447.55 A: they always live with that 

448.33 451.30 A: you know fear of what what's going to happen but i think 

451.43 454.94 A: at least for myself i find when i get into a real crowded place or 

455.33 456.44 A: a concert or something 

456.74 459.02 A: i certainly look where the exits are 

458.62 459.06 B: mhm 

459.16 461.80 B: definitely more so than before i do too 

459.24 459.91 A: (( you )) know and 

461.25 461.76 A: yeah 

462.05 465.86 A: it's just it just comes naturally and i think you just kind of go into that 

466.69 467.95 A: kind of self-protection 

468.19 468.62 A: mode 

468.87 469.30 B: yeah 

469.73 471.30 A: you know you're looking to see well 

471.98 473.32 A: if something were to happen what 

473.58 474.59 A: what could i do 

475.86 477.23 A: so unfortunately 

477.91 481.17 A: you know it's it's too bad that that has to be the case but what are you going to do 

481.40 481.79 B: right 

482.12 484.04 A: again we have no control over it 

484.25 485.54 B: at least now we have the 

486.18 487.38 B: the benefit of being prepared 

487.58 488.82 A: mhm well hopefully 

488.13 488.43 B: (( )) 

488.69 490.15 B: at least somewhat yeah 

490.02 491.19 A: yeah hopefully so 

491.42 492.64 B: it does reassure me to see how 

492.88 495.72 B: they've had extra training now for the rescue crews and 

495.70 496.16 A: right 

495.83 497.25 B: everybody seems to be a little bit 

497.57 501.07 B: more well prepared than they were for nine eleven although i thought they did a fabulous job 

502.14 502.84 A: they did 

502.16 504.34 B: considering what happened and how quickly it happened i thought 

505.03 505.32 B: the 

505.06 506.45 A: it was amazing really 

506.01 507.07 B: they truly are heroes 

507.41 509.88 A: you know you you see what people are honestly made of 

511.16 511.79 A: you know and i just 

513.20 514.32 A: it it's amazing 

514.49 515.95 A: but hopefully we're not going to have that 

516.21 517.09 A: experience 

517.31 523.12 B: i hope not i think there's going to be more terrorist attacks but i don't think they'll be on as large a scale because i don't thing there's anyway they could 

524.04 525.77 B: they could get in here and do that again 

526.23 527.05 A: maybe not 

526.34 528.44 B: i hope i like to think that 

527.92 530.96 A: yeah (( )) we can try to be optimistic anyway 

530.98 533.48 B: (( this settled )) hope for the best prepare for the worst 

531.19 531.51 A: (( got it )) 

533.09 534.81 A: right 

534.91 536.17 A: well oh i think that's just 

537.41 538.44 A: that's human nature 

538.90 539.60 A: you know that we're 

540.11 542.28 A: we're going to think that everything is fine but 

543.09 545.96 A: i just think that that heightened awareness is important to have 

546.77 547.16 A: and 

547.59 548.68 A: you know especially with 

549.87 551.81 A: impending war and and 

552.37 553.20 A: you just don't know 

553.49 556.16 A: who that's going to set off or how it's going to set people off 

556.31 561.93 B: mhm and it's kind of a catch twenty two like if we don't go to war then what do we do sit back and wait to be attacked 

561.76 562.77 A: well see that's it 

563.35 564.48 A: it really is it 

564.62 565.11 A: so 

565.54 567.00 A: it's so difficult to know
