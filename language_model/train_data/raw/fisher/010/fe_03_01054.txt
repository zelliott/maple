6.77 8.69 A: i guess we are supposed to talk about this 

8.70 10.92 B: okay i've never done this before 

10.18 13.61 A: no i haven't either um well comedy 

11.60 12.29 B: okay 

14.16 15.54 A: i think that it is offensive 

15.88 16.32 A: when it 

16.56 17.13 A: be g- uh 

17.32 18.37 A: belittle somebody 

19.34 20.40 B: yes 

20.78 21.61 B: or if it 

21.84 22.45 B: is 

22.85 24.13 B: degrading someone 

24.13 25.25 A: yes i agree 

24.54 26.54 B: not just belittling someone 

25.80 30.99 A: yeah i agree that uh degrading things shouldn't be said racial um 

31.56 33.80 A: anything about your physical appearance 

34.18 34.89 A: um 

36.32 39.12 A: i don't know what else to say 

37.50 42.53 B: well you know like your social status or anything like that 

43.42 50.01 B: some you know some people can handle something like that but there's so many people out in the world that can not handle 

50.13 51.82 B: someone else talking 

52.02 55.00 B: about them in a derogatory type manner 

55.17 55.94 A: and that's true 

56.41 60.02 A: that's very true i know that i had i have an uncle who used to hate 

60.35 64.35 A: he used to love to tell jokes polish jokes but he hated when somebody said -em to him 

65.47 66.99 A: because he was polish and i'm like 

67.29 68.55 A: that doesn't make any sense 

68.55 70.12 B: yeah that doesn't make sense 

69.10 69.66 A: but 

69.79 77.83 A: he just couldn't handle it so i guess that would be correct he felt that was degrading his his nationality i guess 

71.53 72.05 B: yeah 

77.01 77.59 B: yeah 

78.28 80.80 A: but he was he was one who would hand it out 

82.61 84.56 B: well i can i can handle some 

84.91 86.17 B: some types of humor 

86.53 87.14 A: mhm 

86.79 87.99 B: or a comedy 

87.84 88.63 A: mhm 

88.18 97.19 B: but whenever they are starting to to use fowl language you know like the stand-up comics or something on t._v. i can not handle that like that 

100.71 103.41 A: create comedy without putting the words in there like that 

102.32 103.06 B: yes 

104.00 106.19 A: um and some comics are famous for that 

106.31 106.74 B: yes 

106.82 113.62 A: for using the fowl language and i just really basically will turn them off i don't want to listen to it 

110.97 111.44 B: right 

112.92 115.38 B: in fact we'll even get up and leave 

115.59 115.98 A: yeah 

115.67 116.89 B: out of the show if it 

117.78 119.30 B: too (( )) or whatever 

119.44 121.84 A: i do think that comedy in itself 

122.47 123.81 A: does help people 

124.54 129.17 A: um i know the more that that you laugh the more that you um 

130.10 132.98 A: have humor in your life i think helps to 

133.13 134.18 A: um keep you 

135.05 136.10 A: happy healthy 

136.38 137.23 B: uh-huh 

136.61 138.02 A: i do believe it helps 

138.22 138.58 A: but 

138.82 146.36 A: i think that they have to watch what they have what they have to say in regards to um nationalities and things like that 

146.17 147.64 B: well yeah per- people's 

148.67 150.10 B: feelings and stuff like that 

150.12 150.44 A: yeah 

150.71 151.45 B: yeah 

150.73 152.05 A: i agree 

151.99 152.89 B: i agree too 

152.38 160.34 A: i guess we are supposed to carry this on for ten minutes i don't know how you are supposed to do that but i do think 

156.65 158.52 B: i don't know either 

160.59 166.16 A: that we need comedy i just think they have to be more cautious about how they approach it 

165.77 166.21 B: yes 

166.31 175.48 A: you know especially when they are on t._v. or uh what hours they put these things on sometimes these comics that make the fowl language are on when our children are watching 

175.60 176.50 B: yes they are 

176.61 177.15 A: and 

177.25 179.94 A: sometimes you don't you are not even aware of what your kids are watching 

180.09 180.76 B: right 

180.33 181.93 A: if you are in a different room 

182.04 184.50 B: well you know there's some types of humor that 

182.06 183.61 A: so i think they really 

185.06 190.03 B: you know it's just acceptable for adults for married adults or whatever 

189.66 190.21 A: correct 

190.22 193.66 B: and it's not acceptable for children and they should have 

194.11 194.71 B: you know 

194.84 196.74 B: that up in the left hand corner 

196.66 199.66 A: now see i have one comic that i like a lot which is bill cosby 

196.91 197.63 B: saying that it's 

199.85 200.34 B: uh-huh 

200.21 201.49 A: i think he presents it 

201.89 202.48 A: well 

202.73 203.11 B: yes 

203.62 205.15 A: i think he is very comic 

205.75 208.03 B: yeah but he doesn't degrade people 

205.88 206.36 A: um 

207.66 208.82 A: no he doesn't 

208.56 211.26 B: but he does sometimes make fun of people 

211.54 213.97 B: but but it is in 

214.15 215.71 B: a pure humor 

215.85 217.00 B: fashion 

215.94 216.40 A: yeah 

216.60 217.21 A: yeah 

218.10 221.67 A: so he is one of my favorites but uh there are other people i don't really care for 

219.41 219.97 B: yeah 

222.16 224.21 A: um chris rock i'm not real thrilled with 

225.05 226.80 A: i don't like him 

226.78 227.64 B: chris rock 

227.74 229.45 B: i'm not sure if i know that one 

229.51 231.62 A: i just don't care for the humor 

231.33 231.84 B: yeah 

232.13 233.46 A: uh and some other people 

233.75 234.30 A: um 

235.75 240.39 A: i can't think offhand name-wise but some of -em i just don't care for the way that they present things 

239.01 241.13 B: yeah like jerry seinfeld or 

242.26 243.48 A: see i don't like him no 

243.17 244.83 B: yes see i don't like him either 

244.58 246.50 A: no i don't care for him i think it's 

245.94 252.37 B: and i didn't enjoy his show either because that same humor came over in to the show 

247.95 248.39 A: no 

248.53 249.89 A: no i never watched his show 

250.40 250.76 A: right 

252.18 254.82 A: yeah i never watched that show either i didn't care for it 

253.71 254.21 B: yeah 

254.61 257.70 B: but now i do i do like tim 

258.93 260.26 B: the toolman tailor 

260.10 262.99 A: yeah i like him yeah 

260.36 261.76 B: whatever his name is 

262.14 263.74 B: but he does make 

264.09 264.95 B: very 

265.44 266.51 B: he can make racist 

267.06 271.46 B: type remarks and his but it's out of stupidity it's not out of 

268.95 269.48 A: right 

272.02 272.46 A: yeah 

272.13 274.71 B: you know trying to put someone down 

274.00 276.76 A: in a sense he makes him himself out to look 

277.40 277.86 A: stupid 

278.04 278.54 B: right 

278.56 280.03 A: and that's what is comic about it 

279.99 280.40 B: yes 

280.67 286.75 A: is the fact that he doesn't know what he is talking about half the time and it is comic 

283.48 284.38 B: (( )) 

284.93 286.03 B: yeah 

286.42 288.24 B: yes and i do enjoy his

332.83 333.34 B: yeah 

333.94 334.80 B: yeah 

334.60 335.71 A: so 

335.42 339.25 B: well there's other comedians that i do like and that would be 

339.78 340.57 B: uh 

342.63 343.67 B: dick van dyke 

344.86 346.16 A: yes i like dick van dyke 

345.50 347.11 B: bob newheart 

346.64 347.26 A: yup 

347.90 348.93 A: tim conway 

348.68 349.79 B: tim conway 

349.92 351.83 A: well uh you know those are older ones 

351.95 352.58 B: yes 

352.51 356.05 A: and their humor wasn't really the fowl language and stuff they 

357.15 358.88 A: uh the comedy was different then 

358.64 361.05 B: yes it was like a natural type comedy 

360.75 364.28 A: i mean some of the stuff that these comics come up with i can't believe they can actually 

365.66 369.11 A: talk about it or say it on t._v. or anywhere else 

366.63 367.21 B: right 

369.38 369.87 B: yeah 

370.47 375.89 A: and i just i can't believe how popular they have become with with the type of humor they have 

376.38 378.72 B: yeah and i i can't understand that either 

378.88 379.45 B: because 

379.04 380.79 A: well see i feel that if we 

382.34 383.78 A: parents our anybody who 

383.92 388.62 A: doesn't like it would stop watching it and i know people who do watch it even though they don't like it 

389.18 393.68 A: would stop doing it these people probably wouldn't be able to become as popular as they are 

395.15 398.73 B: i don't know you know with society being as it is 

398.81 399.29 A: yeah 

399.28 400.68 B: that type of humor 

401.38 402.04 B: is 

402.46 405.23 B: is what they are getting them with 

403.89 410.09 A: but i'm saying if the people would dis- the people that disagree with it -cause there are some people out there that still watch it even though they don't like it 

407.49 408.35 B: yeah 

410.21 410.71 B: right 

410.71 412.21 A: just to have something to watch 

412.35 412.82 B: yeah 

413.17 415.19 A: and you should just not 

416.04 417.06 A: watch it or 

417.35 424.52 A: um you know buy things that are involved with it like a com- a comic you don't like well don't go out and buy his videotapes or anything then you know 

422.83 423.39 B: right 

425.04 425.58 B: yeah 

426.40 427.11 B: i agree 

428.50 431.00 A: but i still think we all need some comedy in our life 

431.13 431.69 B: yes 

432.00 433.53 B: but it should be a clean 

435.09 435.84 B: clean 

435.98 438.10 B: you know to where anyone can listen to it 

438.12 438.50 A: right 

438.69 439.52 B: or watch it 

439.66 440.44 B: or whatever 

441.30 443.50 B: and not just to where a certain people 

444.08 444.78 B: can watch it 

444.89 446.21 A: yeah i don't like when they make 

446.36 449.69 A: com- make comedy out of um 

449.94 451.69 A: uh like 

453.72 455.86 A: what do i want to say um 

458.24 459.82 A: oh i can't think of the word 

460.68 461.94 A: like when when 

462.23 470.15 A: oh bad people i'm trying to think of it gangs and stuff like that and they make comics comedy out of it 

464.46 465.09 B: yeah 

467.81 468.40 B: uh-huh 

470.22 470.85 B: yes 

470.63 472.41 A: when it's not a funny situation 

472.34 472.96 B: yes 

473.15 476.49 B: and they make it in to a comic situation to where it is sort of 

475.11 477.45 A: right they make it in to a big joke and 

476.61 477.63 B: ease over 

477.91 479.95 A: it's not a joke 

479.09 479.58 B: right 

480.08 483.42 A: and i think there's other ways they can be comic without 

483.79 486.29 A: you know without using those type of circumstances 

486.26 486.84 B: yes 

488.19 488.94 B: i agree 

490.52 493.58 A: i have a comic little person in my room rearranging my room 

494.24 500.70 A: so this is the kind of comedy that you like yes 

496.12 497.76 B: now she's doing very good 

498.61 499.20 B: yes 

501.77 503.15 A: so um 

503.39 507.57 A: i don't know i can't think of anything else comedy is really not a real wide 

508.87 510.36 A: you know real wide for me
