9.72 11.25 B: and how will i react 

11.44 12.06 B: hm 

12.36 15.81 B: i will be very concerned most of all i would be afraid for my two children 
16.24 18.25 B: i will (( )) and then 

18.56 19.74 B: my wife uh 

20.15 23.18 B: will be in uh the next one in the order of priority 

25.90 31.00 A: i think that i would probably feel the same way that if it actually came to a terrorist attack 

31.51 34.99 A: i know that i would panic but my main concern would definitely be for 

35.14 35.98 A: my children 

36.69 37.54 A: and 

37.67 39.02 A: um my relatives 

39.97 40.83 B: and then uh 

41.82 42.41 B: um 

42.56 46.78 B: we haven't rehearsed yet uh what we will do in case of a (( )) emergency 

47.38 51.49 B: uh but um i will be afraid that both my wife and i would be trying to uh 

52.10 54.45 B: find the kids and be missing each other and 

55.03 56.61 B: you know the uh old story of 

56.87 57.49 B: running around with 

58.16 59.61 B: like a chicken with your head cut off 

59.79 60.28 A: yes 

60.53 65.03 B: so uh we definitely have to put firm our plans in place and i live out here in the coast of florida 

65.35 68.65 B: and we know what to do in case of a hurricane and whatnot but we usually have like 

69.28 72.33 B: a weeks worth of warning and we have time to prepare and 

72.73 76.36 B: to be more attuned to uh what needs to be done 

76.51 78.46 B: but a terrorist attack is a sudden 

78.66 80.16 B: catastrophe and uh 

80.36 81.42 B: we are not prepared for that 

81.86 86.35 A: what scares me is that i live in michigan and i know that we have the highest 

87.05 95.33 A: um middle eastern population in the united states is located in (( )) michigan which is about two and a half hours from me 

95.47 97.73 A: when the nine eleven attack happened 

98.40 100.71 A: there is a family from 

100.93 102.14 A: the middle east 

102.32 106.56 A: was here in the town that i'm from and it was not very pleasant for them 
104.47 105.01 B: mhm 

106.99 109.74 A: one thing that bothered me a lot is that i know these 

107.01 107.66 B: (( what )) 

109.86 110.21 A: this 

110.88 114.52 A: and i know i don't know if there was an involvement with 

114.77 124.02 A: the the cells um but what bothered me is that the prejudice that ran through the town rampantly towards this family 

133.16 134.46 A: and put them in camps 

134.55 136.36 A: because we were afraid of them 

136.57 137.69 A: and 

137.98 138.52 A: that 

148.13 151.43 A: it scares me that our country will not handle it 

151.76 158.48 A: well you know i'm i'm really scared that they are going to start rounding up these men and putting them in camps 

159.19 161.71 B: just goes to show that we are human too with uh 

161.93 169.25 B: the imperfections of humanity i think human prejudice will be the last of the imperfections that man will lose 

164.68 164.94 A: yeah 

169.76 172.63 B: whether it's the twenty first century or the twenty fifth century 

170.16 170.42 A: yeah 

173.53 176.59 B: but uh unfortunately that is part of life 

177.05 178.54 B: but i think education 

179.37 181.16 B: letting everyone know uh 

181.64 183.28 B: uh each other's culture 

184.50 188.36 B: will tend to soften our fear a bit 

188.94 193.11 B: uh we don't break bread together we don't associate with one another 

193.45 195.27 B: it does lead to suspicion 

195.52 202.01 A: yes i um had an experience a couple of weeks ago i was at a very very high building 

202.50 203.56 A: in ohio 

213.31 214.03 B: hm 

213.36 213.76 A: and 

213.86 216.32 A: for for a fleeting second 

216.47 218.22 A: i knew how the people 

218.50 219.51 A: on nine eleven 

219.66 227.09 A: felt when they realized what had happened and when they were jumping out of the towers and it saddens me to think 

227.31 227.90 A: that 

228.61 232.98 A: as american citizens in a way the united states we have let our guard down 

233.47 235.37 A: you know we didn't expect um 

249.82 255.09 A: that is really sad to think that we actually as a country did let our guard down to think that we were 

255.56 258.88 A: the safest and the best country in the world 

259.49 260.06 B: yeah that 

260.28 262.49 B: that has changed quite a bit hasn't it 

262.97 264.57 A: yes it has and with that 

264.77 266.72 A: with that has come um 

267.90 274.42 A: this great fear and i know that the night of nine eleven when i put my youngest son to bed because where i live 

274.68 282.45 A: is a military base in michigan and of course you know the skies were silent that day there were no planes that flew except for military 

279.73 280.27 B: mhm 

283.04 287.76 A: and that night when i put him to bed i told him if something happens in the middle of the night 

288.14 292.66 A: know that i will always love you and i have never ever in my entire life 
293.07 299.41 A: of forty five years felt the fear of going to sleep at night and not really knowing are we going to wake up 

299.82 303.25 B: hm it's a it's a genuine fear and (( i'm )) 

300.43 301.10 A: that was 

302.59 303.75 A: it's a very much fear 

304.02 305.09 B: i remember uh 

305.38 305.75 B: um 

305.96 308.58 B: in my late forties now i remember being a 

308.90 310.57 B: young adult in my early twenties 

311.03 311.47 A: mhm 

311.80 312.41 B: and in 

312.56 317.29 B: fact it was even in high school they were talking about eventually america of the future 

317.89 320.65 B: will have to have an internal security force 

321.17 324.28 B: in charge of security and maintaining the peace 

321.23 321.69 A: mhm 

324.73 325.10 A: mhm 

324.77 332.22 B: and that it will have to be with armed soldiers armed soldiers in the street and we were all laughing because that was like a foreign thought to us 

332.56 332.95 A: yes 

332.60 333.89 B: so here we are 

334.24 337.22 B: two thousand and three and we have homeland security 

337.51 341.05 B: and eventually within five years the homeland security will have 

337.59 337.95 A: yes 

341.57 342.27 B: big teeth 

342.64 345.03 B: and we'll they'll have an internal security force 

345.30 346.53 B: (( really )) soldiers 

346.69 348.02 B: modified officers 

348.33 349.78 B: will have the power of arrest 

350.30 353.78 B: and the power of execution but i think uh 

354.15 357.35 B: that is unnecessary byproduct to maintain 

357.76 360.67 B: some sort of law and order but i guess americans have to decide 

361.32 364.65 B: what price liberty if they want the freedom it's going to have to be 

364.77 366.04 B: constantly (( cleansed )) 

366.65 368.39 B: with uh innocent blood 

369.13 372.43 B: because we have the mentality of putting our heads in the sand 

372.87 375.69 B: and not accepting the reality of things 

373.06 373.37 A: yes 

376.64 378.14 B: and the world will remain 

378.34 382.03 B: insecure as long as there's any family who feels afraid 

382.63 384.95 B: as long as there's any children who are hungry 

382.90 383.22 A: yes 

385.45 387.95 B: as long as there's any people who don't hope 

388.68 390.75 B: they are going to do all they can to survive 

391.13 393.88 B: and that means they're taking it out on us they will 

394.19 397.15 B: so we are going to have to decide if whether we are going to do an equalizing 

398.50 402.12 B: or be the policeman of the world or become so isolationist 

402.71 406.89 B: that any intrusion whatsoever will be met with unbelievable force 

407.87 413.70 B: and i'm uh hey and as an adult i'm not prepared to make that decision for myself or my children 

414.34 416.95 A: no i'm not either but i feel that this whole 

417.19 419.98 A: terrorism um it it really makes 

420.36 428.05 A: like i said i've never felt this much insecurity and this much fear since nine eleven and this is like an ongoing 

428.64 430.39 A: thing you know it makes you wonder 

431.05 437.33 A: um i know that within myself when i go to the larger cities and seeing someone of middle eastern descent 

437.47 438.02 B: mhm 

437.86 439.72 A: um it it makes you wonder 

440.08 440.35 B: yes 

440.18 447.78 A: and that that bothers me as a human being that bothers me as the person i am to think oh my god i can actually question 

447.95 448.96 A: this person 

449.17 450.43 A: based on 

450.67 453.96 A: the color of the skin based on what i think they may be 

454.22 459.70 A: and that really really scares me but also think that as a country 

459.89 462.34 A: after what happened in new york 

463.02 464.96 A: i feel that we have taken 

465.11 468.13 A: way way too long to retaliate 

468.89 475.20 A: um and now we are looking at we are going on a year and a half since nine eleven and what have we really done 

474.22 475.20 B: and it's sort of like um 

475.58 477.61 B: it's sort of like retaliating against what 

477.96 479.40 B: it's like our children if they 

479.60 480.62 B: they disobey you 

480.95 483.43 B: you sort of like want to provide them the 

483.56 486.27 B: the necessary discipline right then and there so they can connect 

486.73 487.15 B: the 

487.79 489.12 B: the failure on their part 

489.24 492.93 B: with the discipline but now what are we actually retaliating against 

493.44 497.48 B: i'm agreeing with you it took so long but i'm even forgetting why exactly we are retaliating 

497.88 499.85 B: uh retaliating against and for what 

500.36 501.78 B: and to get what sort of result 

502.22 503.36 B: we've taken too long 

502.66 503.04 A: yeah 

503.89 505.11 B: that is because we're not ready 

506.73 507.22 A: yes 

508.58 509.28 A: where do i sign it 

509.63 511.08 A: hang on i'm (( talking )) at my computer 

511.21 512.77 B: oh okay 

513.03 514.45 B: doing two things at the same time 

514.82 516.66 B: but then on the other hand um 

517.63 520.92 B: i'm afraid that uh the worst is yet to come 

521.71 522.16 A: yes 

521.82 524.45 B: and maybe as a civilization we'll 

524.54 526.01 B: we'll learn something from it 

526.74 532.44 B: but i sure am embarrassed and sad that we are going to leave a lot of problems for our children to solve
