27.32 36.74 B: (( um i think some of them might i- from what i've heard already you know when the status alert was heightened and a lot of people were buying all the duct tape and the [lipsmack] window things and stuff [lipsmack] um but [lipsmack] i'm not too sure i think some people might run some people might not [lipsmack] mhm no [laughter] yeah right mhm yeah )) 

36.86 39.11 B: (( i know that on the news reports )) 

41.05 42.78 B: (( a lot )) 

43.16 46.67 B: (( there was a news report for )) 

47.93 51.17 A: i would think that most people would 

50.86 51.82 B: (( you )) 

51.62 54.73 A: um did you did you buy duct tape 

54.88 59.23 A: and plastic neither did i [laughter]

59.34 61.37 A: i was like oh well 

61.38 65.94 A: oh we should look did you look at the clock because we have to talk the full ten minutes 

65.58 66.49 B: (( to get the )) 

66.27 70.89 A: and we gotta make sure that that we go the whole time um 

71.27 80.76 A: we have ah yeah there are lotta people all over the news with the duct duct tape and the plastic which i thought in a way was kind of a panic 

81.14 82.07 B: (( supplies )) 

81.25 87.90 A: because i've been real real kind of comfortable with all of this ah you know i mean you can only do so much 

87.61 89.15 B: (( and stuff )) 

89.96 102.69 B: (( you know the army surplus stores on a lot and they're talking about how all the stores were out of duct tape but [lipsmack] no i didn't get anything like that [laughter] no uh-uh mhm [laughter] and how to calm yourself down and [laughter] that sort of thing so um yeah i i think that there probably more than you that a lot of )) 

103.51 106.16 B: (( people would panic really badly )) 

106.39 111.06 A: no and i didn't buy any water [noise] did you buy water or extra food 

111.51 120.64 A: no um a but around here i actually went to the store right after than happened and there was a a little [noise] panic 

120.58 131.56 A: um a lot of the i went to the store in the afternoon when it's normally empty and it was absolutely packed and that was my conclusion that everybody's panicking 

131.40 132.47 B: mhm 

131.63 137.19 A: people were buying lots of you know food and bottled water and canned goods 

137.25 148.98 A: and ah i had to wait a really long time in in line and so i was kinda rolling my eyes at the panic what i perceived to be people kinda panicking at the [cough] 

149.04 151.07 A: the initial threat 

151.19 154.02 A: and then they had on the news you know that 

154.27 155.91 A: (( people ah )) 

156.19 159.75 A: could go to counselors in the area and what to 

164.52 167.78 A: (( do um i if there )) 

169.52 170.37 A: (( was )) 

172.02 173.09 A: (( a )) 

174.07 178.07 A: terrorist attack here like right in your town 

178.43 180.90 A: do you think you would you would panic 

181.14 183.84 B: i think there'd be more panic if there was like one 

183.80 197.11 B: or a threat of it right in my area but [lipsmack] so far there there hasn't really been in my area [lipsmack] um i'm in minnesota so [lipsmack] there hasn't been too many threats around here um but i know that even 

197.23 209.76 B: way back with y2k so many people were stockpiling food and water and stuff it just made me think of that how many people have stockpiled food and all that thinking that there's gonna be something happening then and nothing happened then 

209.53 210.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

210.03 220.01 A: [noise] well it's too cold for a terrorist attack in minnesota [laughter] i think they'll stay in the warmer places now we're in ohio 

213.89 214.83 B: yeah 

219.97 229.36 A: and ah we're a little closer to it not being you know like across the united states from um washington d._c. 

229.21 230.23 B: mhm 

229.64 237.03 A: you know we're actual driving distance so i think that that's probably why maybe we're seeing a little more 

238.00 249.60 A: panic over here [noise] i think if if something happened i think we would see among the people around here i think there would be some some pretty major panic because 

249.78 253.48 A: there appeared to be some pretty major preparation 

253.67 254.62 B: right 

254.10 258.59 A: [noise] um and i'm just kinda watching it all going 

258.80 262.12 A: oh well [noise] oh well 

260.03 261.09 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

263.97 273.00 A: if there is an actual attack um i have a little girl who's making all the noise honey can you quiet down i'm on the phone please 

273.34 277.49 A: ah a little three year old and i think if i did panic 

277.62 280.40 A: it would be more over her safety 

280.09 281.20 B: mhm 

280.61 283.40 A: um i i think i would 

283.95 294.16 A: if i thought she was endangered in any way um i think i would you know take every step necessary you know to keep her safe but myself i 

294.82 297.47 A: i've got kinda hard hard nerves 

297.53 298.74 B: mhm 

298.16 302.69 A: and i don't think i would be too worried um 

303.28 316.57 A: er unless i thought you know like something was coming in my house and and then i think i would panic and maybe try to ah save save the family or something as much as i could 

316.15 317.01 B: [mn] 

317.50 323.79 A: my my husband's even more laid back i i don't think he would panic at all i think he'd go oh well 

317.53 318.88 B: (( [sigh] )) 

324.09 326.77 A: and if there was like a an er and 

327.15 331.87 A: it depends on what kind of terror attack like if there was something nuclear or something 

329.63 330.47 B: right 

332.00 336.72 A: ah we talked about it we would want to be at ground zero [laughter] 

336.10 337.40 B: mhm 

336.79 342.26 A: if if you know i mean you're talking major world devastation life if if the 

342.92 347.69 A: the terrorism you know escalates into nuclear war 

347.91 349.07 B: right 

348.89 351.66 A: but if there's 

352.11 360.45 A: um if it's something just local i i think i would just try to protect myself as much as i could and and i think my husband would too 

358.72 359.68 B: mhm 

362.12 363.95 B: yeah i think the same thing with 

364.17 372.06 B: the only place that they even said was kinda a threat here is the malls of america and that's like about an hour away but you know i 

372.29 382.49 B: i think i would prob- pretty much try to protect myself first i'm in a apartment building so i'd try to do as much as i could within the building and it's just me and my husband so i think 

382.76 394.62 B: oh he's always wanted to get the gas mask but [lipsmack] i don't think of it [lipsmack] necessary yet but you know i'd probably try to get the proper precautions and hopefully there'd be some kinda warning if something were to happen 

394.82 402.07 A: um i think you know i have family in the military and they laugh about the gas mask thing because you really need oxygen 

401.58 402.90 B: right 

402.62 407.06 A: and you can't really store oxygen without a great deal of risk 

406.72 408.00 B: mhm 

407.38 416.84 A: you know in your own home because it can blow up or if somebody smokes you know you have to be real careful [noise] so the military people in my family kinda laugh 

416.82 417.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

417.31 418.43 A: [noise] 

418.60 425.30 A: about the gas mask thing because it's not it's not real helpful against the kind of things that 

425.38 428.92 A: um they're talking about dumping on us it 

428.55 429.66 B: mhm 

429.10 434.83 A: would be helpful if there was like a lot of smoke in the air or something or you know something minor 

435.04 436.35 B: right 

435.73 437.28 A: um so 

438.93 441.35 A: yeah with um 

441.51 445.84 A: gosh this is hard it it sounds like we both kinda agree 

443.09 444.40 B: (( yeah )) 

447.21 451.06 A: and i don't know how i well let's see um they said 

452.38 455.20 A: terrorism and panic 

455.60 456.67 A: um 

456.82 464.02 A: i think they're th- d- like when when there was the terrorist attack in new york er when they hit the towers 

463.84 464.91 B: mhm 

464.36 470.20 A: um there was a a a lot of interest in that i think if ah 

470.77 472.03 A: (( if they )) 

472.19 475.50 A: i don't think i saw people really panic 

475.80 479.69 A: at that but i think if they thought it was ongoing 

476.48 477.12 B: (( [cough] )) 

480.73 481.74 A: um 

481.80 488.92 A: er that it would hit more than one one place or you know that there was the possibility of more terrorism 

485.27 486.29 B: right 

489.03 496.77 A: ah you know around the united states i think i think there would be a lot of panic the other thing is um i know with um 

493.46 494.51 B: mhm 

497.88 503.39 A: with the terrorists er with the potential of us going to war 

503.44 511.27 A: ah with iraq a lot of people are really really concerned that there will be terrorist attacks does that concern you 

511.54 516.59 B: yeah i think um after we go to war you know there there are going to at least be some 

516.66 523.59 B: they're going to at least try to attack us ah some type of revenge type of thing in my opinion 

523.58 531.78 B: especially if it's true that um bin laden and saddam hussein have ties to each other you know just something i've heard off and on 

531.60 534.82 A: yeah you hear that on the news um 

533.85 534.62 B: mhm 

535.75 536.76 A: um 

537.04 545.06 A: what i was thinking back was ah do you remember when reagan hit kaddafi for for ah doing terrorist acts 

544.88 545.87 B: mhm 

545.27 546.42 A: abroad 

546.51 551.76 A: and ah they totally shut up and that totally stopped 

552.09 559.73 A: and so i'm more inclined to believe that if we show ourselves as really strong and we will come after you 

557.53 558.45 B: mhm 

559.81 566.04 A: that um all but maybe the very most extremist suicide bombers 

565.86 567.00 B: mhm 

566.55 568.17 A: (( would ah )) 

569.15 577.03 A: would come after us and even then i'm not so sure because all of that stuff stopped with reagan and they 

576.52 577.45 B: right 

577.20 582.46 A: they were doing some some kinda suicide bombing stuff then too i think weren't they 

582.74 583.83 B: i think so 

584.57 589.08 A: um and ah i feel that in the world that ah 

589.44 596.55 A: if if we show ourselves as very very strong and not hes- hesitant to slap back but 

596.64 599.89 A: ah i think all this has come about because they
