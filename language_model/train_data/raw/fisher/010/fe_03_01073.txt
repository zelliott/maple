7.05 7.95 A: hi ya 

8.23 13.78 A: so um i guess we're talking about like ah i guess we're talking comedy then 

14.14 15.14 A: so do you 

14.18 17.33 B: the yeah the line between it [laughter] 

16.72 17.73 A: sorry 

17.99 19.12 B: um 

19.66 21.89 B: so what kind of humor do you like 

21.74 23.63 A: (( um well )) 

23.78 33.35 A: i d- i quite i mean i'm impre- i'm always impressed with a stand up comedian if they can if they can actually manage 

33.45 44.63 A: a very clean sort of act because you know we have some that really just do rely on swearing and nothing else and they claim the 

44.83 49.06 A: you know they're trying to be sort of deliberately provocative without really 

50.22 53.65 A: er without really being very good and 

52.54 62.97 B: right i totally agree with you [laughter] um i think it it's easily possible to um have a comedy act 

54.82 55.61 A: [laughter] 

63.16 70.04 B: without all the swear words and and ah getting what shall i say raunchy 

70.01 71.59 A: yeah 

70.63 71.62 B: um 

71.70 77.40 B: yeah i i kinda like the old type of ah comedy acts like um 

77.64 87.30 B: oh carol burnett she did a lot of slapstick and ah it was kinda funny i i kinda like type of humor um whose type of humor do you like 

80.91 81.84 A: uh-huh 

87.29 88.43 A: um 

88.95 92.10 A: well i'm f- um we pr- 

95.03 103.82 A: i don't know the peo- the people who who i like you you might not know i mean i i just be- well because i'm from britain and so we have quite different comedians to the comed- 

101.27 102.42 B: oh okay 

103.86 111.91 A: like nobody who i like anybody's heard of of all my friends over here it's really unfair i have nothing to talk about with people 

107.06 108.24 B: [laughter] 

111.36 117.22 B: i was gonna say um have you ever watched whose line is it anyway but i think all those comedians 

115.18 116.90 A: oh yes 

117.44 123.32 B: they're from ah canada but i think it originated in britain didn't it 

122.05 130.23 A: yeah that's right because you have um i do like that and actually that's a good example of because the good ones are that really tall guy 

130.58 132.39 A: um ryan styles 

131.15 133.59 B: oh ryan styles yeah 

133.02 147.44 A: and yeah and the ca- and um the canadian but there's a british guy called tony slattery and he just swears and he's really unfunny because he c- it's like he really can't think of anything else 

141.15 142.06 B: mhm 

147.09 148.10 B: yeah 

147.45 154.35 A: and i think that and that's like probably the greatest example of just someone swearing just because that's all they can do 

154.08 159.54 B: yeah because they have nothing better to add to their act [laughter] i know what you mean 

156.79 163.44 A: yeah yeah who yeah whose line is it anyway though i think is a is a very good show 

164.29 168.35 B: [sigh] i think ah we need a lot of humor nowadays [laughter] 

164.66 165.45 A: (( ah )) 

167.82 169.34 A: (( [laughter] yeah i )) 

169.51 170.59 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

171.72 175.35 B: but i guess there is a line between it um 

171.76 172.74 A: (( know )) 

176.61 178.12 A: yeah i mean you 

179.88 188.28 A: know i mean i have to say there are some comedians who i think can swear like quite well like they can come up with a very sort of 

188.86 190.59 A: bad and cutting thing 

190.38 192.49 B: [laughter] george carlin 

190.76 199.34 A: and you go that's a great and you think oh i you know i wish i could think of that but i wouldn't although you wouldn't actually say it in real life but um 

199.80 211.51 A: it only really works on on occasion and if it's all the time then it's not really look at the si- i mean the simpsons are sort of what do you the simpsons the simpsons are sort of very um 

213.07 218.98 A: well you know it's supposed to be a kids' show but there's all sorts of um things going on in the background 

216.38 219.94 B: yeah it's not exactly for kids [laughter] 

219.99 230.09 B: i know what you mean it's not exactly for kids um but it is funny um i wouldn't want our um if i had a a real small child i wouldn't want 

230.16 237.98 B: her or him to to watch it but ah it is kinda funny for adults i must admit i do watch it 

235.67 237.41 A: yeah 

238.27 239.26 B: um 

239.83 242.62 B: (( what was i going to say i like um )) 

243.72 245.97 B: seinfield because he can 

245.00 245.79 A: (( ye- )) 

246.04 254.21 B: he can take just the most kind of mundane type of life situations that are 

254.33 257.12 B: are end up being 

257.19 258.75 B: ah humorous 

258.40 260.22 A: mhm 

259.08 270.85 B: and um he puts it into his act and and ah as far as i know unless he changed his act he's not smutty or offensive at all 

270.67 273.55 A: yeah yeah 

271.65 273.87 B: well i used to like to hear him 

275.05 278.17 B: ah did did you ever watch um 

275.06 276.56 A: (( i was at )) 

278.42 281.66 B: (( ah impromptu any of the impromptu acts )) 

278.46 279.71 A: (( i've i've )) 

280.47 290.04 A: i haven't i haven't se- i haven't seen him do i haven't se- um you know i've only seen like the t._v. show and o- only then a couple of times 

290.22 291.34 A: (( um )) 

292.00 296.71 A: i've i i know the so- um i i think i i think i might know 

296.76 301.15 A: er sort of er what you mean though there is um 

303.40 306.58 A: because you know there are so many comedians that are 

307.11 313.42 A: you know when you go to see when you go to see people live i've been to see a few people live they are very um 

314.67 327.95 A: you know because they're so you know so rude and things like that i well you know um there doesn't really seem to be very much room or very much call for like a very sort of clean kind of family comedian 

317.53 318.41 B: mhm 

328.46 329.60 B: right 

329.85 330.90 A: (( um )) 

331.51 336.58 A: and i of- and i often think it must be it would be quite difficult to be 

336.85 340.97 A: a sort of family comedian just bec- um 

341.18 350.05 A: because it's very hard to actually appeal to sort of more well it seems to me anyway that it seems to be quite hard to appeal to like a lot of adults and um 

350.66 352.13 A: (( and )) 

352.62 354.16 A: (( sort of younger )) 

354.31 355.74 A: younger children 

355.79 356.88 A: at the same 

357.20 358.32 B: yes 

357.71 361.37 A: (( time um because )) 

361.42 370.29 A: ah oh well at at home there's a we have a comedian called harry hill and he used to be on sort of late at night just because he was just because of like alternative 

370.02 370.92 B: (( yeah )) 

370.17 380.89 A: and but he was but he m- makes a point of just being very clean and very good and they've sort of put him on earlier and earlier but there's a few people who just think he's silly and and childish 

380.61 381.75 B: mhm 

381.10 382.42 A: (( um )) 

382.50 395.45 A: and although i don't know i think it'd be quite a good um i i think he's particularly good oh hey um what do you think about um the rad- what do you think about radio comedy 

395.65 397.30 B: radio comedy 

396.83 398.15 A: yeah 

397.63 398.61 B: (( mm )) 

399.11 402.14 B: um as far as i know there isn't any 

402.74 403.98 B: ah 

404.22 406.09 B: lately i know 

406.76 410.32 B: way back there was like ah jack benny 

408.18 409.43 A: yeah 

410.60 412.22 A: (( ooh i don't know that one )) 

411.78 417.28 B: [laughter] i know my dad used to listen to them and he used to tell me about them 

416.65 417.49 A: uh-huh 

417.36 418.98 B: (( they were kinda funny )) 

418.73 419.55 A: (( oh )) 

419.59 425.24 B: um didn't ah george burns and his wife didn't they start out on the radio 

426.22 428.36 A: (( george b- oh oh i )) 

427.47 430.87 B: like gracie george burns and gracie 

431.04 433.14 B: i think they used to be on the radio 

433.13 435.21 A: (( ah mm i think a lot )) 

434.22 434.99 B: (( yeah it )) 

435.87 437.27 B: would be nice if we could ooh 

436.01 439.97 A: it's suppo- it's supposed to well i mean i'm saying again from 

440.29 448.91 A: not not necessarily from the way it works in america but apparently it's quite a a good way to get into writing comedy is to start on the radio 

449.13 454.97 A: i quite like um a quite like radio comedy it's a different on the radio it's still 

455.53 456.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

456.45 462.61 A: a lot cleaner again because it all i mean there's no such thing as late night radio really 

462.87 463.86 B: mhm 

463.07 469.15 A: (( er um actually apart from one show i can think of that's really bad but um )) 

469.24 482.27 A: so it's all um and there's been a number of sort of good series good sitcoms that started on the radio that have ended up being um transferred to the television at least at home at least in britain 

480.16 481.05 B: mhm 

482.47 488.93 A: and it's still quite a vague ah thing like it it's m- radio comedy really 

489.00 491.62 A: is amongst most of listened to 

492.24 495.86 A: radio including sort of you know popular music shows and things 

496.14 496.79 B: (( ooh )) 

496.85 500.01 B: so what kind of um radio shows 

500.22 502.14 B: were there or are there 

501.91 504.48 A: um well some of them you can have you don't get 

504.55 508.46 A: (( like you don't get just like a sort of stand up kind of routine )) 

508.25 514.83 A: and sometimes you have like a spoof you see you might have spoof shows like there was a good spoof news program 

514.19 515.17 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

514.66 528.52 A: and it just made fun of the news and it did it really um and it wasn't sort of topical it didn't make fun of what was going on in the news it made fun of the news itself and how self important the news is and how they love it if there's a war going on and things like that um 

528.31 529.52 B: mhm 

528.89 536.49 A: and you know there's a good bit where he does an interview between australia and new zealand or something and he gets the two to go to war um 

536.57 537.78 A: and 

537.99 543.38 A: li- the the the news anchor and then then when it happens the whole 

543.90 550.76 A: it's obvious like the whole studio there has already been set up and there are people all ready in the field and things like that um 

549.26 550.38 B: mhm 

551.88 553.32 A: (( they um )) 

552.05 553.78 B: that sounds like it me 

553.62 559.05 A: so so it is um or you might have actual just radio situation comedies um 

559.21 560.39 B: mhm 

559.80 562.83 A: and and 

563.86 572.33 A: it's you know and it's it's play is all on obviously all on all on people's voices and there's and it's v- and timing is very important 

571.64 572.77 B: mhm 

572.49 576.74 A: um there's a few shows from the sixties 

577.12 581.30 A: (( that were really um like sort of bawdy )) 

581.46 586.67 A: (( and um i said bawdy because i thought it was an old fashioned kind of word you know kind of fits )) 

585.95 588.75 B: bawdy what does bawdy mean 

587.05 587.73 A: (( w- )) 

588.26 594.95 A: oh it means sort of um like it 

595.80 598.70 A: it was quite ah um
