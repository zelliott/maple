10.26 14.15 A: oh okay wonderful [laughter] um 

14.44 16.39 A: gosh i know i'd panic 

16.89 19.74 A: but i'm in the mid west so i 

19.78 22.41 A: probably would be one of the last 

23.73 24.61 B: um 

24.71 31.57 B: i'm in the south and that's kind of being down near florida around water and stuff it's it's 

32.43 33.57 A: oh 

33.75 34.93 B: it's a fear 

34.69 36.26 A: oh i bet 

35.47 39.53 B: it's a fear um especially having military bases around 

39.74 41.33 B: i know i would panic 

40.97 42.25 A: yeah 

42.08 42.65 B: (( i )) 

42.82 44.84 A: i do live right by 

45.05 52.85 A: army reserves but because i'm in the mid west i believe that we would be the last for chemical 

53.30 58.63 A: or even suicide bombers we don't really have any landmarks or anything 

58.91 60.03 A: that would 

60.66 63.01 A: be a major target 

63.24 66.58 A: but i panicked with nine eleven and that was 

66.63 68.59 A: hundreds of miles away 

68.25 69.16 B: true 

69.05 70.73 A: [laughter] 

69.93 70.85 B: um 

71.70 74.42 B: it's a terrorism is a very 

76.37 81.96 B: a very scary topic um i'm prior military i spent seven years with the military 

81.70 82.81 A: oh my 

82.72 86.83 B: and terrorism is one of the things that they teach you 

87.31 91.73 B: to be on the lookout for especially whenever you are stationed in other countries 

91.85 95.59 A: did you ever run across anything anywhere you were 

94.43 98.62 B: me myself no [laughter] thank goodness i never did 

97.41 99.88 A: yeah luck of the draw 

99.80 100.90 B: um 

101.54 109.92 B: they teach you to to really be aware because how they will how terrorists will make you a target and 

111.36 114.49 B: for lack of better words butter you up to get information 

114.65 116.48 A: oh yeah i'm sure 

116.13 117.20 B: so 

117.89 121.48 B: whenever you look at and whenever i look at 

122.18 129.05 B: terrorism here in the united states i have a different viewpoint than what you have because of the things that i was taught in the military 

128.62 129.78 A: right 

129.89 131.86 A: yeah i'm sure 

131.48 137.11 B: to me some place is not going to be obvious it's going to be one of the main places that they hit 

136.86 146.50 A: so i'm one of the [laughter] i need to worry a little more after all [laughter] [laughter] 

142.08 145.61 B: no please don't take things that way i hope that's not what 

145.64 147.97 B: that's just my line of thinking 

147.84 155.07 A: did they teach you how to deal with people like us who who are just shocked and devastated when 

155.25 158.31 A: we do end up with a suicide bomber and 

158.85 163.03 A: and you guys are sent for the aftermath 

162.87 163.76 B: um 

163.84 172.32 B: suicide bombers at that point in time whenever i was in the military was not one of the things that we really worried about we were worried more about espionage 

172.42 177.09 B: um i got out of the military shortly after desert storm occurred 

178.03 179.00 A: oh 

178.27 185.63 B: so this is you know this type of suicide bombing thing is something that i'm not familiar with 

186.26 188.68 A: and don't fairly want to be [laughter] 

188.61 190.15 B: no because 

190.80 196.67 B: if you read about other countries and the way that they treat their own people it's a very scary thing 

196.23 201.47 A: and it it seems to me that it almost seems like old hat to them 

201.53 204.11 A: when there's a bus bombed 

203.83 210.58 B: right i mean we're talking about people who line people up in their own streets and shoot 'em just for having a different of opinion 

210.94 212.67 A: yeah that's 

213.29 215.26 A: yeah [laughter] 

213.95 223.36 B: you know and yet they still have such a devotion to their own country that they're going to volunteer to go to someone [noise] else's country and strap on a bomb knowing they're not coming back 

223.36 229.94 A: now that i definitely don't understand you know i ki- kind of understand the people still 

230.20 234.67 A: rooting for their own country even after their 

234.72 238.65 A: head man does things such as line people up on the streets 

238.76 240.70 A: and and what not 

240.71 242.78 A: because they're stuck there 

242.47 243.31 B: true 

243.24 252.46 A: you know they have to eat and they and water and from what i understand those are things that are used as bargaining tools but 

252.56 254.95 A: yeah the suicide bombers and 

255.06 257.34 A: other terrorist attacks 

257.56 261.28 A: i i can't i can't understand that at all 

263.16 265.74 B: and and i don't know i mean 

266.35 271.31 B: i guess in order for me to understand that i would have to actually live there and i'm still grateful i don't 

270.97 272.48 A: (( yeah )) 

271.44 276.04 B: to be able to understand because it seems like there's a lot of mind control 

277.11 278.37 A: pardon me sorry 

278.03 282.28 B: a lot of mind control involved in that type of situation 

282.58 285.10 A: there there there must be or 

285.74 288.48 A: knowledge ah i don't 

289.20 294.51 A: i mean about the other countries and how to get out 

290.33 292.42 B: (( and )) 

293.86 297.71 B: it would have to be something that's instilled in these people from 

298.25 299.67 B: toddler age 

299.79 301.61 A: yeah yeah 

300.53 305.02 B: i mean because they have such a devotion to it that they have to believe 

306.29 314.28 B: you know and i talk to to other people and stuff and they want to blame it on a certain type of religion well i disagree with the religion portion of it 

314.85 322.54 B: because here in the united states we have all denominations all beliefs and all backgrounds from religion 

322.11 325.45 A: and no suicide bombers [laughter] 

324.06 329.39 B: well i mean you have your nut cases every now and then i mean look at you know 

326.49 328.17 A: oh yeah 

329.82 330.86 B: (( um )) 

329.84 330.79 A: (( yeah )) 

331.21 336.97 B: what was the one guy jones who convinced everybody to take the poison and put themselves to sleep 

336.70 338.21 A: right right yeah 

337.67 342.81 B: and david koresh in texas i mean you have these episodes 

338.99 339.95 A: yes 

340.04 341.17 A: (( yes )) 

343.11 346.48 B: like in columbine every now and then but nothing 

347.11 351.95 B: where anyone has been willing to go to another country and 

352.65 355.65 B: sacrifice themselves in order to com- 

356.31 358.12 B: commit mass murder 

357.99 362.09 A: i have never heard of an american citizen 

362.18 364.37 A: committing a terrorist attack 

365.48 366.31 A: i 

366.36 370.23 A: if anyone from our country whether they were 

370.61 374.00 A: born in another country and brought to this country 

375.01 376.07 A: or 

376.27 381.21 A: were born in this country period i've never heard of an american citizen 

382.69 384.70 A: committing a terrorist act 

384.18 385.45 B: i haven't either 

386.63 387.71 B: and 

389.12 397.97 B: as much as other incidents where americans go and get into trouble in other countries is broadcast i think that would be one of the main things that would 

398.77 401.03 B: have definitely hit the news waves 

400.78 404.47 A: you you have to wonder the mentality of the people 

406.12 409.88 A: and the morals that that they're taught i 

410.18 411.97 A: i couldn't imagine 

412.15 416.16 A: any thing any religion 

416.85 418.93 A: any even my president 

419.13 424.61 A: i couldn't imagine president bush or any other president in the united states office 

424.96 429.13 A: to convince me or my family to ever commit a terrorist attack 

428.72 429.55 B: (( uh-uh )) 

429.85 440.61 A: and it's scary to think of the power that they have over their citizens and what they teach 'em is morally right and morally wrong they must be taught that it's okay 

441.08 443.55 A: i i can't imagine that you know 

443.84 451.45 A: they realize that we have families and feelings and that they're not they're not hurting our military by hurting our 

451.74 453.09 A: (( citizens [laughter] )) 

457.17 458.13 B: it's 

458.74 462.43 B: not one of those topics that you can make sense out of that's for sure um 

461.00 463.13 A: yeah yeah yeah that's 

464.79 466.46 B: how to handle it 

467.09 469.16 B: that's an even 

471.15 472.55 B: harder topic 

472.66 475.00 B: especially whenever you know 

475.36 476.72 B: you're looking at 

477.93 479.92 B: completely innocent people 

481.63 495.32 A: well i have to say i do i i worry i can't say that i don't worry that we won't get a terrorist attack just because i'm in the mid west i know that doesn't mean that we we won't get a suicide bomber or something to that effect 

495.27 507.31 A: but you know i have to wonder to what extent should i be one of the people getting duct tape and plastic or is that a myth that the news people just tell you to be quiet or [laughter] 

506.41 508.84 B: well i haven't done anything that far 

508.47 511.81 A: i have i've done nothing i can honestly say i haven't 

510.03 514.79 B: i i i don't think the next one will be if there is another terrorist attack 

514.80 522.37 B: i don't think that it will be anything that they've done before and that's what makes it so scary is because they're not going to be so obvious 

519.52 521.12 A: yeah i i 

522.35 526.62 A: i truly believe the next one is going to be some sort of chemical 

526.63 537.83 A: or and i don't i'm very young i'm only twenty four i've never been alive during a huge war i was alive during the past wars that 

537.75 542.03 A: you were probably in service but i wasn't alive for 

542.26 544.85 A: world war one or world war two 

545.20 546.96 A: and it's 

548.82 550.22 A: eye opening 

550.76 555.46 A: i think a lot of a the american citizens don't know now to 

555.61 566.90 A: vote for presidents i can honestly say that i had no idea before all this happened i didn't pay any attention to politics never thought about terrorism before nine eleven in my life 

567.17 569.26 A: and now it's scary 

569.25 577.85 B: well i had thought about it but it was always one of those things that was related strictly to military and being elsewhere never here at home 

577.52 578.73 A: right 

578.62 581.79 B: and nine eleven brought that to a new 

582.85 584.82 B: a new awareness 

584.89 585.92 B: which 

590.00 592.79 B: considering that my last duty station 

592.90 599.40 B: before i got out in ninety one was up in the area where those events actually took place because i was stationed in aberdeen 

599.14 599.89 A: oh my
