10.51 15.47 B: i know and we're supposed to be talking about comedy and where we draw the line 

14.87 16.18 A: yes 

15.70 18.74 B: i don't know [laughter] 

17.73 20.04 A: well i would draw the line 

20.39 24.83 A: i i've i've i could definitely say i would draw the line at language 

24.26 25.61 B: (( yeah )) 

24.98 28.46 A: i like ah i like clean comedy 

28.03 28.86 B: yes 

28.74 32.88 A: and it can be you know a little unclean but it has to be tasteful 

32.77 41.91 B: i know not like ah oh eddie murphy and um what's that other comedian that is so funny but his language is outrageous my 

41.29 45.01 A: robin williams surprised me when i saw him do stand up 

44.64 48.44 B: oh i've never seen him just do stand up comedy 

47.17 51.70 A: i mean he's hysterical but the language is ah way too much 

49.75 56.57 B: yeah he i would think that he would yeah he probably uses the f word and everything else no one 

54.81 62.96 A: yeah in fact it's funny because the first time i saw him was on t._v. but it was like in the late eighties and i has only known him 

62.97 75.71 A: on mork and mindy and thought of him as a really wholesome young man [laughter] and i was quite shocked my favorite stand up comedian would be bill cosby because he does such a clean hysterical act 

65.84 68.98 B: oh no oh yeah ooh 

73.78 74.61 B: yes 

75.12 76.24 B: yes 

76.00 79.99 A: and that that's the kind of comedy that i would say that that i like 

79.40 85.13 B: i do too and he ah he can be funny without using any vulgarity or any 

85.28 86.43 B: i mean 

85.95 89.39 A: i know his face alone is ah is hysterical 

90.11 92.25 A: the faces that he's able to make 

91.63 95.98 B: i know i love watching him you laugh at him just watching him 

95.41 96.81 A: oh yeah 

96.13 107.23 B: but i can remember when i was little and of course i'm a lot older than you are but we used to have um a record and i would sit and listen to it over and ov- it was bill cosby 

106.94 107.89 A: yeah 

107.29 111.59 B: and i mean i listened to it over and over and over again 

111.74 117.98 B: and i just fell in love with him from that but now you know that he had his own show and everything i mean oh 

118.02 121.71 B: it we still watch it it's on like um nickelodeon at night 

121.81 122.80 A: (( yeah )) 

122.19 124.34 B: it's one of the few programs [laughter] 

124.70 127.29 B: that i can watch with little kids at 

127.48 134.97 B: night because it is you know so wholesome and and so funny and you don't have to worry about what they say or what they do 

134.43 136.20 A: exactly 

135.24 136.50 B: i know 

136.19 149.75 A: like with the car- cartoons today i don't know if you are watching them but they're so adult oriented that it's almost sad for my five year old who doesn't get half the humor and i have to decide what he can like 

146.72 147.81 B: right 

149.90 157.14 A: there's so many shows that are funny to adults but not appropriate for children and it drives me crazy 

153.99 155.20 B: right 

155.46 161.51 B: and they're violent some of these cartoons are in are violent i was just amazed 

159.38 160.58 A: yeah 

160.95 166.89 A: i mean when i watched loony tunes as a child i knew that what they were doing was not real 

166.63 167.55 B: right 

167.11 174.29 A: and it was funny but the stuff they're doing now is so well animated that it i don't see how they draw the line 

173.91 176.26 B: um i don't think they do 

175.92 177.06 A: yeah 

176.48 186.48 B: ah and i can't tell you the name of the movie that i saw it's been four months ago but and it was a child's movie but there was a lot of adult connotations in it 

186.09 187.15 A: mhm 

186.54 193.22 B: and of course the children didn't understand it went right over their head but i thought now why do they even have to put that in here 

192.37 198.64 A: yeah it makes me sad for them that they have to watch something that half the stuff they don't even get [laughter] well 

197.13 205.35 B: i know it's like but i think they do that because they know otherwise we adults would probably fall asleep maybe who knows i don't know 

205.28 210.49 A: see i wouldn't because i love i love all the kids' shows that are good [laughter] 

207.84 221.02 B: yeah yeah [laughter] wo- but maybe they think you know the adults would fall asleep so that's why they put it in but little do they know that they could just make it nice and funny and clean and and hysterical for little ones 

218.28 219.39 A: mhm 

220.38 222.04 A: yeah and 

221.03 224.67 B: they they try and get to a bigger audience though i'm i'm convinced 

224.44 229.02 A: i just thought of of something else there's a lot of things that 

229.07 237.73 A: um i would consider okay in comedy like racial jokes and i don't mean that in a weird way like i'm married to an italian so i find italian jokes hysterical 

237.65 246.69 A: and i'm irish and i find irish jokes hysterical you know i just find racial jokes like that funny that are they're funny not not rude or 

240.36 241.50 B: right 

246.28 247.37 B: right 

246.71 248.49 A: you know ah 

247.76 249.66 B: offensive in any way 

248.60 252.58 A: offensive yes and and i i just find that 

252.62 253.77 A: (( that ah )) 

253.93 267.07 A: people are so sensitive about that today and i think it's ridiculous but then some people do go over the top like with the whole black white issue that drives me crazy that ah the some of the stuff that i hear about that now some of it is funny 

260.91 262.06 B: that's true 

267.26 280.23 A: and a lot of it is about white people and i find it very funny but um i think some of it is either taken too sensitively or def- definitely done over the top but it seems like we're losing the 

275.01 276.27 B: mhm 

280.14 290.72 A: ethnicity of america in comedy like you have it seems like comedy is the only place that they don't have to be careful about what they say [laughter] so i guess that's good but 

287.24 289.30 B: i know i know 

290.23 293.08 B: anything goes freedom of speech huh 

292.65 295.14 A: yeah yeah and 

293.96 301.75 B: but you're right people with different ethnic backgrounds i mean and they can laugh at themselves look at that movie my big greek wedding you know 

300.76 302.33 A: oh i love that movie 

301.92 307.20 B: i mean i haven't seen it yet but it looks like it it's going to be absolutely funnier than any 

302.40 303.90 A: (( it is hysterical )) 

306.41 313.57 A: oh i think that you that you can put a couple of different ethnicity's in there like you could definitely put italian in that movie it would be exactly the same 

310.21 311.33 B: yeah 

313.04 314.07 B: (( same )) 

313.86 318.14 A: i don't know exactly what else you could put that would be exactly the same but 

316.79 321.41 B: yeah but if we can't laugh at ourselves sometimes i think we you know people just 

321.75 335.15 B: get too wrapped up in you know the fact that they are italian or they are or they're offended by you know jokes where people say an italian and a jew and a preacher went to the river you know and they 

333.40 338.46 A: right and i grew up with jokes like that and now you never hear them anymore 

335.24 336.02 B: (( [laughter] )) 

338.13 344.75 B: no no because they're afraid somebody will [laughter] will take them to court and they'll have a civil law suit [laughter] 

343.77 353.27 A: have you seen the commercial where they have a priest and a rabbi and an italian like every ethnicity and they have a horse and all these people in a bar 

353.50 355.53 B: i don't think i've seen that one 

354.71 366.46 A: it's hysterical all these people in a bar that would normally be in one of those jokes and they're i think it's a heineken commercial and they show heineken and they say this is why they walked in or something like that 

356.29 357.89 B: what's it advertising 

358.87 359.95 B: yeah 

361.08 370.72 B: oh yes i have yes i have yes i have yes i have [laughter] 

366.93 371.36 A: that's comedy [laughter] that was great 

370.73 372.56 B: [laughter] yes yes 

372.08 377.51 A: but we recently ah we recently went to italy my husband's actually from there 

377.32 379.78 B: (( ooh what a thrill )) 

377.64 386.36 A: and it was oh it was beautiful and they are hysterical i mean you can't you can't hel- i mean everything they do is funny everything they do is dramatic and 

384.23 385.12 B: (( yeah )) 

386.22 389.86 B: well because they use their hands you know [laughter] 

386.38 387.98 A: and passionate 

388.21 401.33 A: yes and everything they talk about like i'm limited on the language but so parts i couldn't pick up i was like oh what are they talking about and it will be something stupid like going to the store [laughter] but they're so they're so 

395.63 396.52 B: yeah 

396.95 398.78 B: feel like you're missing out 

401.48 407.74 A: humorous in the way they do things and of course they like to make fun of things that i did and i'm totally fine with that because 

405.20 406.41 B: oh i'm sure 

407.23 411.95 B: oh yeah that's what makes the world go around that we're all different 

407.93 409.93 A: it's different to them and 

410.64 420.82 A: exactly i do think though now ah with the war on terror and everything it's very inappropriate to be making fun of the president i really don't like when they do that 

419.45 428.04 B: i agree with you and i don't know i know david letterman hasn't been on lately because he's been sick but i hope that he or jay leno don't 

428.32 437.71 B: you know how they do their opening and they take jabs at the daily news and they always take jabs at the president and i i sure hope that they keep that out of their opening 

431.83 433.02 A: yeah 

434.18 435.19 A: yeah 

437.90 440.35 B: ah whatever you know 

439.95 451.49 A: i mean we've come these are older people too like jay leno and david letterman that have grown up in a society where they need to respect their country and it's okay to make jokes in an appropriate time um 

442.54 443.50 B: (( yeah )) 

444.97 445.92 B: yeah 

451.07 453.15 B: oh they had a hey day with clinton 

453.08 460.86 A: right and he deserved it [laughter] but again if we were facing war with clinton i'd feel the same way even though i didn't like him at all 

454.53 455.93 B: mhm 

459.13 461.96 B: (( yeah i know )) 

460.88 463.69 A: but um i just feel that 

463.79 470.55 A: they need to we need to whether we like whether people agree with it or not need to present a united front and 

469.86 471.64 B: that's exactly right 

471.03 476.88 A: everybody can see our television i mean that everybody that needs to or wants to around the world [mn] 

477.24 483.62 A: leaders and things like that and and it's i'm sure they already know that hollywood is against it and 

483.33 485.20 B: yeah they've made it known 

484.69 490.33 A: that's all common knowledge to them so it doesn't help when we're broadcasting it on t._v. 

489.62 490.98 B: (( i know )) 

490.63 499.20 A: so i i think that i'm always surprised even with clinton that people could make ah remarks like that in comedy because 

498.33 501.98 B: i was surprised too but i mean they really [mn] 

500.73 504.61 A: like thirty or forty years ago wouldn't you be like arrested [laughter] 

503.80 512.02 B: i think so and you know there were things going on thirty and forty years ago that they could've talked about also but they didn't 

511.43 512.58 A: right 

512.12 519.93 B: they really dig deep nowadays and the er and some times it's anything for a laugh and that's where i think oh yeah that's where i draw the line 

519.57 520.52 A: yeah 

520.44 531.11 B: like you said when the when the country is you know in a in a crisis like this and they're gonna make fun of the president or make jokes about i i'm a little bit tired of the french jokes 

521.27 522.52 A: definitely 

531.43 532.28 B: you know 

531.65 533.10 A: i haven't heard them 

532.55 536.72 B: oh my gosh well because the french you know and the ah well 

536.99 543.31 B: they really are our friend however they haven't decided yet whether they're gonna join us in this venture 

542.99 544.48 A: they haven't decided 

543.87 556.67 B: evidently well now they're just making horrible fun of them and i've been hearing stuff on the radio ah different things like well we're not gonna call um our french fries french any more we're gonna call them american fries and we're gonna 

555.75 558.04 A: i've i've heard freedom fries 

557.49 567.94 B: that's it freedom fries and i mean any time you would use the word french they're throwing freedom in there because i mean they've just been making such terrible fun of the french 

567.60 568.53 A: mhm 

568.19 571.42 B: [mn] i'm just tired of it i guess you know i don't i i 

572.03 573.26 B: mean y- 

573.88 581.39 B: do we expect them to join us now after we've made fun of them and you're you know making jokes about them and criticizing them 

579.47 584.86 A: i i actually haven't heard the jokes i've heard them more of boycott the name 

584.44 585.33 B: yes 

584.92 593.40 A: and the products but i haven't heard the ah the jokes but then it seems like the last two weeks i haven't seen any television so [laughter] 

586.46 587.57 B: yeah 

591.48 592.86 B: you're better off 

593.11 599.95 B: [laughter] you're better off unless it's comedy central right [laughter] 

596.88 599.04 A: (( [laughter] ))
