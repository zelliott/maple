93.77 94.41 B: right

97.25 97.94 A: i have one 

98.09 98.66 B: mhm

101.12 101.89 B: mhm 

101.94 105.26 A: so that is a long ways off where he wants to go so 

103.83 104.16 B: hm 

105.05 105.72 B: mhm 

106.24 106.81 A: and 

106.99 112.16 A: i don't know i'm i'm not feeling very good about that i would like to keep him home but i also want him out of the house 

112.68 114.41 A: so what will i do 

113.57 115.43 B: yeah i hear you there 

115.68 117.25 A: what about you do you have kids 

115.69 116.27 B: actually 

116.80 118.20 B: mine are two and four 

118.53 121.03 A: oh you you have yours (( )) which that is nice 

121.13 121.89 B: so they are 

121.16 122.14 A: those are nice ages 

122.40 123.48 B: they are little but 

124.19 129.88 B: i worry about it because they are so young by the time you know they are of like adult age who knows what is going to be going on 

130.23 131.99 A: and they have the whole future ahead of them 

132.10 132.61 B: yeah 

133.53 137.68 B: i just kind of been playing that we watch fox news like twenty four hours a day my husband does 

137.80 138.32 B: anyway 

139.00 140.05 A: that's the one i watch 

140.42 141.42 B: and it's (( )) 

140.59 142.18 A: see it on on cable fox 

142.24 142.82 B: yeah 

142.40 142.89 A: on cable 

142.96 143.50 B: mhm 

143.07 144.17 A: well that is the one i watch 

145.10 154.09 B: so i know when the uh i know when the terrorists alert or the the level from the homeland security went up to high i called (( )) water who we get our water from 

154.52 156.09 B: and ordered like eight bottles of it 

156.90 158.72 B: but that is as far as i went at that point 

160.36 161.53 B: i do think though 

161.93 163.97 B: i mean whether we go to war or not 

164.78 166.69 B: there is going to be some type of 

168.30 170.89 B: through different groups things pop up throughout the country 

172.57 175.66 B: terrorist attacks whether it is biological or 

176.63 178.69 B: bombing or whatever it may be 

179.34 180.94 B: i don't know how do you feel about going to war 

181.21 183.67 A: uh i don't necessarily like the idea 

183.66 184.31 B: yeah 

184.12 185.40 A: but i almost kind of feel like 

185.68 188.69 A: either you know we just got to do it or not 

188.33 189.60 B: i know it's the it's the 

189.79 190.91 B: going back and forth 

191.02 196.12 A: yeah it's it's it's just too long and i think that we possibly waited too long 

196.51 198.73 A: -cause the weather situation isn't looking 

198.87 200.39 A: particularly good for our troops 

200.28 200.78 B: right 

200.75 203.59 A: this is not their they are not accumulated to that environment 

203.77 204.31 B: right 

204.31 206.50 A: neither is our machinery i don't suppose 

206.76 207.40 B: right 

207.51 213.06 A: so that doesn't make me feel very good and then whenever we should go to war or do something 

213.48 217.13 A: there are so many incredible horrible things that could happen to you 

217.70 218.38 B: oh i know 

217.74 218.07 A: that 

218.27 222.46 A: you know i mean you can just use your imagination about some of the things that might just happen and um 

222.61 224.21 A: that doesn't make me feel very good 

224.77 225.29 A: at all 

224.84 225.27 B: yeah 

225.54 228.15 B: one of my best friend's husband's have been in the uh 

228.26 230.54 B: army national guard reserves 

230.81 234.47 B: since i can remember and they've got a five year old and 

234.68 235.41 B: triplets 

235.82 236.49 B: three year olds 

236.98 237.53 A: wow 

237.73 238.60 B: she stays home 

238.72 239.53 B: and um 

240.55 241.93 B: we just saw them probably 

242.27 243.24 B: a month ago 

243.72 248.55 B: and they they really did not have any anticipation that he would get called up because his troops that are his 

248.72 250.68 B: particular unit had already been to bosnia 

251.48 253.18 B: blah blah blah and um 

254.28 257.94 B: a week and a half ago that he got a call on thursday and he had twenty four hours to report 

258.74 260.62 B: to his base which is in indiana 

261.17 262.40 B: and she sent me an email 

262.77 269.01 B: a couple of days ago saying that he had received his anthrax vaccine his smallpox vaccine and that they were paying for him 

269.44 270.66 B: to get lasik 

270.95 272.11 B: done on his eyes 

273.83 275.69 B: which i was going wow you know 

276.33 278.87 B: five thousand dollars there to get your lasik done on your eyes 

279.40 281.09 B: to make sure he can see well enough 

281.66 283.20 B: or to enhance his vision you know 

283.64 284.24 A: huh 

284.36 285.22 B: isn't that crazy 

286.01 289.09 A: well that just makes me think they know a whole lot more than we know 

288.94 289.48 B: mhm 

289.60 290.14 A: i mean 

290.25 293.12 A: but they only tell you so much in little bits and pieces 

293.79 294.22 B: right 

296.18 299.41 B: so yeah i don't know i 

299.65 301.30 B: i was definitely more 

302.00 303.99 B: i felt more comfortable about going to war 

304.79 306.53 B: at the earlier stages of it all 

306.82 312.60 B: but now it seems like every day something is popping up with iran north korea 

313.40 314.31 B: you know all these different 

313.56 315.46 A: north korea is (( )) 

315.86 316.53 B: they are 

316.53 319.14 A: they are trying their best to to start something 

319.24 321.89 B: well in why is everybody against the united states 

321.99 325.72 B: with all the aid that we give people it's just ridiculous 

322.00 323.04 A: i don't understand it 

325.46 327.91 A: i wonder how they would feel if we just pulled out of their countries 

328.39 329.06 A: and let them 

329.25 330.12 A: be to themselves 

330.13 330.57 B: right 

330.95 332.56 A: so that ought to fix -em don't you think 

332.95 334.61 B: i think that is a better idea 

335.41 337.42 A: well then see how much they want to support us 

337.87 339.52 A: they would be clamoring to have us back 

340.43 344.43 B: yeah i was watching and it was interesting too i'm not i don't know a lot i mean i'm not 

344.94 345.96 B: super super political 

346.29 347.46 B: and i don't watch a ton of it 

347.80 351.01 B: but this morning on fox they had 

351.71 352.36 B: um 

352.98 355.32 B: tony blair talking in front of his parliament 

355.44 355.95 A: mhm 

355.80 357.22 B: and it was really did you see that 

357.47 358.94 A: i saw a part of that 

358.97 366.24 B: well it was just really interesting it was like i guess they have a one once a week question and answer session and parliament like just drills him with lots of questions 

366.38 369.66 A: he was not having a good day apparently he has been getting a lot of that 

369.48 371.58 B: oh he has been having it it rough 

372.84 373.43 B: and 

373.89 375.06 B: i feel bad because i 

376.00 377.53 B: and he seems like a pretty good guy 

378.48 379.01 A: he does 

380.12 381.72 B: so how did you get into this study 

381.80 385.45 A: oh well i found this one on the internet through the money and shopping 

385.56 387.27 A: it just sort of popped up there right in 

386.79 387.98 B: oh through money and shopping 

388.01 388.42 A: huh 

388.63 390.87 B: yeah i just got up and signed up with that about 

391.45 392.43 B: three weeks ago 

392.70 393.61 A: how is that working for you 

393.69 394.30 B: and 

394.50 398.57 B: i found it through a friend and i have been trying to find something for her forever to just 

398.68 400.84 B: make some kind of income now that i stay home with the kids 

401.72 402.54 B: and um 

402.27 404.34 A: seems like it would be a good idea staying at home with the kids 

404.50 404.96 B: huh 

405.11 406.55 A: it seems like it would be a good idea for you 

406.68 407.70 B: oh it is perfect 

408.20 409.95 B: and the problem is as you know like 

410.21 410.76 B: there is like 

410.97 414.79 B: a hundred and seventy or however many companies you have to actually get on to get on 

415.28 417.59 B: to their online application and fill out that 

418.61 420.17 B: and get on to all their places 

420.26 420.66 A: mhm 

420.32 422.03 B: before you start getting e. mails for jobs 

422.53 422.83 A: are you 

422.59 424.17 B: so i got my first job yesterday 

424.40 424.89 A: oh 

424.71 426.37 B: and it was an optical store 

426.51 427.89 B: a j._c. penny optical 

428.32 431.96 B: and it took me three minutes i walked in the store i had to observe 

432.35 437.07 B: and there were five things i had in my head that i needed to look for was he wearing a (( )) badge blah blah blah blah blah 

437.51 441.74 A: well i must have missed that one i applied for one here and i didn't hear from anybody 

442.21 445.07 B: well i think what happens is you apply 

445.81 446.42 B: and 

447.32 449.51 B: they take the person closest 

449.63 453.70 B: in proximity first and i think it's also how quickly maybe you respond 

454.08 454.66 A: oh 

454.99 455.73 B: i don't know 

455.97 458.06 B: -cause i i have a couple other friends too 

459.00 461.44 B: you know did the same thing to get on they didn't they didn't get it 

462.66 463.29 B: but um 

463.67 465.55 B: i did that i got two malls actually one's 

465.94 468.76 B: both of them are really close to me so i'm doing the other one tomorrow 

469.32 470.38 A: i think that is wonderful 

470.72 474.12 B: it's kind of fun -cause yeah it's it was only it was ten eight no eight dollars 

474.63 478.76 B: for you know five minutes of time i was at the mall anyway or it gave me an excuse to go 

478.91 481.32 A: sure it's nice getting out of the house every once and awhile 

480.92 481.57 B: right 

482.36 484.91 B: but all these little things and then this telephone survey 

485.23 488.36 A: oh i think it's interesting (( )) this survey to hear what i've said 

488.52 489.02 B: huh huh 

489.20 494.22 A: um what do you think about um these resolutions that tony blair brought forth yesterday 

494.59 496.00 A: do you think that they will be accepted 

497.83 503.31 B: i didn't listen much what on what went on yesterday what was the new he he gave a new was it a new date 

503.94 506.63 A: (( )) looking to push back the 

507.28 511.27 A: uh um march seventeenth date by perhaps as much as ten days 

511.30 512.06 B: ten days 

511.91 514.07 A: but to have saddam meet certain uh 

514.46 518.01 A: certain criteria certain things that he must do with the new resolution 

518.23 518.91 B: you know what i 

518.33 521.40 A: like get on t._v. and admit that he was hiding weapons and 

521.81 524.65 A: that he professes that he would get rid of them and uh different things like that 

525.33 527.92 B: what i think about that is that we have already been there and done that 

528.50 531.40 A: yeah i'm kind of thinking that too and i don't think he will do it 

531.23 532.27 B: i don't think he will do it 

532.46 538.05 B: the same exact things have already been told to him the same exact things have actually been told to him for the past twelve years 

538.52 542.46 B: but in that first fourteen forty one resolution they definitely were all stated very clearly 

543.01 546.34 B: he obviously is not doing it and it is just buying him more time 

546.73 549.70 B: and i think it is turning more people against us 

550.34 552.01 A: well he is doing exactly what 

552.23 556.72 A: uh representatives said that he would do before fourteen forty one 

557.11 558.38 A: was drawn up which was 

558.72 563.28 A: buy for time when things got a little tight but he would start relenting a little bit 

563.64 564.10 A: and 

564.80 567.88 A: he would be he would play for time that he is a master of deceit and all of that 

568.25 568.92 B: mhm 

568.61 571.49 A: that is kind of what i'm getting and now that i'm remembering all of this 

569.99 570.67 B: mhm 

572.49 574.41 A: well when fourteen forty one came out i thought that 

574.87 578.72 A: well it will work out they will finally going to come together and take care of this 

579.70 580.10 A: well 

580.29 581.11 A: here we are 

581.38 582.29 B: right i just 

581.96 583.25 A: probably and much later 

583.53 585.81 B: well it is interesting -cause you really get a bigger 

585.97 590.04 B: picture of what goes on with the whole political thing now like the whole united 

590.21 594.67 B: nations and the security council i wouldn't have really known what they really did 

595.21 596.92 B: or what they were all about before this 

597.11 598.55 B: went on and now that they 

598.71 599.79 B: they are looking pretty bad
