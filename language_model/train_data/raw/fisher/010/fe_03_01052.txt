23.75 25.22 B: that's that's fine 

24.72 35.63 A: [laughter] well i mean with humor you know if you you draw the line where i guess you you ah offend someone else and if it doesn't offend anyone or 

35.77 48.88 A: anyone um that's one aspect that you draw the line if you offend anyone that um the person in the company or that they might know or just that offend anyone even if they're not present that's where i would say you draw the line 

49.64 50.76 A: about humor 

50.41 64.49 B: [mn] true er er well i look at it as m- more personal thing where i would draw the line personally myself in accepting comedy because i don't tell jokes a lot but listening to jokes there's certain ones i prefer not to listen to 

64.53 68.61 B: and i'm from um a town that can be ah 

68.81 74.91 B: very prejudiced ah and i don't like hearing certain jokes and i'll either

79.36 81.36 A: yes yeah [cough] 

80.96 85.23 B: ah my way of dealing with it is ah well 

85.39 89.27 B: whatever's appropriate at the time either let the person know that i 

89.39 92.88 B: i don't appreciate those kind of jokes or ah 

92.96 96.84 B: walk away or change the subject in a way that they know that 

96.61 109.82 B: that was inappropriate or if it's my husband i just give him a funny look as well [laughter] oh and he knows he's learned after a while [laughter] that there's certain jokes that he just tells to his buddies at work and he doesn't tell me ah 

99.81 101.39 A: [laughter] 

109.81 113.34 A: yeah well i mean as far as race is concerned i 

113.46 114.31 A: (( mm )) 

114.72 119.82 A: well i mean i guess certain innocent jokes could be acceptable like 

120.11 133.17 A: it it just also it kinda does depend on your company you know if they you know if you're on a personal basis and there are you know there's you know you draw a line on how harmful a joke can be and [cough] hm yeah i mean you just don't want to offend it a great deal depends on how well you know the 

122.94 124.50 B: yes it does 

133.27 135.00 A: (( person and how )) 

135.60 136.65 A: (( well )) 

136.91 142.17 A: (( you know that it's not serious so um also so i mean there's a couple of aspects whether you know the person that well )) 

142.22 144.55 A: (( and you know )) 

144.94 150.67 A: (( how harsh the jokes are as far as race so yeah yeah ooh yeah yeah the company you're in )) 

150.79 154.21 A: (( as far as dirty jokes i mean i mean if you're talking with )) 

155.56 164.58 B: true true ah i don't know i guess i'm a little stricter about just receiving and sending jokes like that my jokes tend to be 

162.78 163.79 A: (( you know a )) 

164.66 171.42 B: i i'm not saying you aren't but ah the way i look at it my jokes tend to be fairly clean and ah 

169.94 170.77 A: (( senior )) 

171.43 183.47 B: oh i sent something [mn] just a little bit off color to my sisters the other day online oh they were just surp- they were just surprised they said yeah i can't believe you sent something like that that's just uncharacteristic 

175.65 176.90 A: (( citizen or one )) 

179.23 180.33 A: (( of )) 

182.78 194.50 A: (( your friends your age i mean that also has a lot to do with it are you fr- where are you from kentucky okay no no i was just wondering because you know oh no i'm wondering because i lived up in massachusetts for quite a while and ))

197.03 199.00 A: (( and i was i was just wondering how my accent would )) 

198.53 200.86 B: (( and that )) 

201.10 203.48 B: (( sort )) 

206.68 212.04 A: is there is there any ah racism at all or is any is there a lot of prejudice in kentucky quite a lot quite a lot i guess that's why i'm i'm thinking 

211.15 215.51 B: (( of )) 

212.47 213.65 A: (( more that than sexist remarks )) 

216.51 217.49 A: right 

217.06 222.49 B: thing because of i've i've never been tolerant of sexist jokes in any way and ah 

222.60 232.04 B: but ah the the race- races can be a problem here ah not so much now as what it was thirteen years ago when we moved here but 

231.38 232.79 A: yeah 

232.18 233.32 B: where are you from 

232.94 241.11 A: i'm from texas where it's the south of it's not considered really the south but you know it's pretty in houston it's pretty multicultural too 

240.15 241.81 B: oh yeah yeah 

241.16 250.98 A: i have a fri- i have friends you know we joke around like innocent jokes about you know race you know with my hispanic friends or whatnot but you know there is definitely a place where you draw the line 

250.68 254.99 B: sure sure well that's like you talk ah 

252.03 253.21 A: yeah 

255.01 258.15 B: you can say i could say anything about my sisters but 

258.17 263.52 B: n- no dare anyone else say anything about them [laughter] you know not so 

261.12 262.39 A: (( yeah )) 

263.21 268.83 A: right yeah exactly wh- so if you know the person well enough or you know it's innocent or 

269.13 273.37 A: you've just got to watch out who your company is or who they might know or 

273.78 277.73 A: and just be on the safe side i just don't say anything too harsh or 

277.91 278.81 A: (( you know )) 

279.34 281.59 A: to inflict harm upon anyone you know 

281.70 284.38 B: yeah yeah that so 

284.45 293.22 B: i don't know i guess i'm considered pretty boring that way that so i will i will try a joke every once in a while but i always botch it up anyway so that so [laughter] 

287.56 288.11 A: (( a- )) 

291.50 292.64 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

292.73 295.60 A: well there's plenty of jokes that don't have any ah 

295.82 297.72 A: harm to them so 

298.01 299.94 A: i don't think that's boring at all 

299.36 306.87 B: oh that's just no i just always flu- fluff up my jokes i just throw the punch line in there ahead of time or or whatever just ah 

306.88 312.04 B: i i'm better at writing them than reading them i gu- or saying them out loud i guess ah 

310.91 312.00 A: yeah 

312.58 313.60 B: but ah 

314.52 316.47 B: i don't know ah humor 

316.92 325.56 B: i read somewhere where humor is the element of surprise as well i don't know if you've ever heard that or not yeah yeah 

322.60 324.15 A: yeah yeah it is 

325.36 332.16 A: well as far as they go blonde jokes those are pretty innocent so i mean not many people would get offended by those 

331.19 339.23 B: i i would guess not i mean you kind of expect that well maybe if you're a true blonde it i don't know [laughter] oh 

336.55 340.53 A: yeah well i'm blonde and i don't really care but i'm not i'm not a girl so um 

340.74 343.47 A: so that has i think a different view but 

343.56 351.22 A: you know um i think race is the the sensitive area that you should race and vulgarity 

351.20 358.64 A: those are the two areas where you should definitely unless you are in close company you should not you know veer into 

360.09 361.06 B: true 

360.15 365.55 A: and even then even then you have to watch out nothing serious nothing you know harmful to harmful or any 

364.86 367.96 B: well i think it all it it goes back to the 

368.47 382.11 B: [mn] the phrase being politically correct um you know those are the general ones but there there's so many others and i i guess you could whitewash everything and and look at it and say you can't say that ah i 

370.48 372.15 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

377.57 378.67 A: yeah 

382.42 388.58 B: i used to be a teacher and i don't know if you are aware of things like ah politically correct fairy tales and that sort of thing 

388.13 390.01 A: oh yeah 

389.05 391.39 B: whitewashed until everything's out of it 

392.41 400.72 B: which is humorous in itself that we have to be so careful of that we put up so many boundaries in order to be ah 

401.13 403.25 B: non offensive to everyone 

402.57 404.82 A: yeah in this day and age 

404.05 406.20 B: yeah yeah 

406.34 407.08 B: that's 

407.50 415.78 B: ah this this is kinda a dead topic for me i don't know what else to say about it [laughter] especially not telling jokes or not knowing jokes 

410.90 411.84 A: [laughter] 

412.08 413.42 A: yeah i mean 

415.28 419.92 A: right well maybe you have you ever been offended by a joke 

419.87 421.14 B: excuse me 

420.53 424.01 A: you are you ever are you ever offended by a joke even 

423.22 424.15 B: um 

424.06 427.32 A: even though like if it doesn't apply to you but 

426.54 434.68 B: right um not usually not personally i i can't think of many that are told personally to me that i'm offended by but ah 

435.34 437.48 B: if it offends someone else 

438.19 439.78 B: if it offends my 

440.57 442.32 B: belief in 

443.78 449.97 A: does it make a difference if you know someone of that er for example of that race if you 

444.07 445.02 B: (( anything )) 

450.09 458.54 A: think of someth- say there's someone you know if you have a black friend if you're does it make a difference if you picture a black friend when or if you have someone 

458.61 463.03 A: ah i don't if you know someone black does it make a difference whether you're offended or not 

463.50 471.79 B: no because i don't look at it that way i it's it's more of a matter of general humanity and what that person is saying and their attitude 

470.33 471.47 A: yeah 

471.73 478.87 B: ah that tells me a lot about in telling a joke like that i i guess it tells me a lot about that person and their bel- 

478.98 481.42 B: their beliefs and priority 

480.38 484.46 A: education level or their how they're brought up 

481.96 483.30 B: y- well yeah 

483.68 493.62 B: where they feel they stand in the whole scheme of life and how i feel about them at that point especially when it comes to racism or sexism for that matter 

489.03 490.15 A: yeah 

492.96 494.46 A: oh yeah yeah 

493.79 505.18 B: ah but i don't see so much of the sexism because i just ah i was in the army for several years and i just i h- heard a lot of it and i learned to just not feel it you know ah 

502.61 504.08 A: (( oh yeah mhm [mn] )) 

505.80 508.82 B: i i just do not allow it in my presence 

509.18 512.79 B: in in subtle ways i wouldn't say that offends me you you can 

512.83 515.87 B: i body language tells a lot er 

515.97 518.25 A: but would there be jokes 

518.27 523.90 A: about women that are innocent that would make you that you would appreciate that would just be a little funny 

523.34 534.21 B: [noise] blonde jokes i'd say yeah they're they're they're funny in a way because you could [noise] i tend to substitute just anything for a blonde a blonde is a just a 

531.10 532.14 A: yeah 

535.37 538.01 A: nothing nothing to yeah [laughter] 

535.38 538.43 B: a dunce of some sort so 

538.51 545.46 B: but ah i don't know maybe that's where you look at it and everyone has their prejudices and their degree of tolerance because ah 

545.50 548.69 B: if you really think about it th- that this is where it gets to be 

548.96 550.32 B: where everything 

550.43 552.99 B: you can look at everything as being politically correct 

553.02 557.74 B: a blonde joke is still making some fun of someone of lower intelligence 

557.11 560.13 A: yeah [laughter] you're right but i mean 

557.93 562.92 B: so [laughter] it doesn't bother me but it [laughter] maybe it should i never thought of i 

561.58 569.09 A: what what about a woman a joke about a woman there um would there be a joke any joke say it is innocent that you could appreciate 

569.65 570.94 B: innocently 

570.53 577.14 A: yeah i mean say it's not really offensive i mean there could be jokes i mean that poke fun like lightly 

572.86 574.28 B: probably 

575.85 588.94 B: probably because i see my my girlfriends i mean we do poke fun at men all the time you know ah but in you know come to think of it there's a lot of jokes that my girlfriends will send me online but i 

581.36 582.86 A: yeah 

588.77 589.70 A: [laughter] 

589.06 591.50 B: i just wouldn't send to my husband because 

591.52 597.87 B: well he wouldn't find it funny [laughter] probably probably be hurt by it [laughter] so i don't send them on 

593.18 594.96 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

597.43 598.53 A: right 

597.99 599.89 B: ah you know and i i guess that
