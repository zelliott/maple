0.17 2.33 A: hi my name's stacey hi 

1.29 2.83 B: hi i'm melissa 

2.93 4.02 A: nice to meet you 

3.74 4.78 B: you too 

4.56 6.44 A: do you want to start 

5.37 6.31 B: sure 

7.32 10.21 B: okay we st- we'll talk about comedy here [laughter] 

10.28 11.21 B: um 

11.81 14.39 B: what kind of comedy do you find humorous 

16.28 21.23 A: well actually the question i got was where do you draw the line between bad taste 

21.10 22.64 B: yeah that's what i'm trying i mean 

22.89 25.89 B: is it i mean where do you draw the line 

25.84 28.43 A: i don't know that there's a specific 

28.50 36.64 A: place i don't know that it's a hard and fast thing it's one of those things like ah whichever judge it was that was speaking about pornography that said i know it when i see it 

36.04 36.97 B: right 

36.76 41.70 A: um i guess i- in fact i've had a lot of discussions about this um 

41.74 47.87 A: with my husband he's british and his take on comedy tends to be somewhat different than mine 

47.81 58.39 A: and i found that when we watch absolutely fabulous that some of the cruelty in it really bothered me but cruelty in other comedies doesn't bother me and i haven't been able to determine 

58.47 65.98 A: exactly what makes that difference for me which makes this kind of a hard discussion because it's not like okay rule one rule two 

64.25 65.10 B: right 

65.73 70.47 B: right i think cruelty and racial issues are a problem 

71.37 73.67 A: yeah i could easily agree with that 

73.41 79.31 B: um now offensively i don't think bad language could be considered 

79.23 89.40 B: to me offensive i mean some people may but you know if you're letting your kids watch it you know then yeah that would be a problem but like they say turn the channel [laughter] 

89.00 91.52 A: right entirely different standards for children 

91.04 94.28 B: right and i don't really think comedy is for children 

91.79 92.55 A: (( um )) 

94.40 95.67 B: in that standard 

95.66 101.06 A: well i think there's there's child appropriate comedy but it tends to not be nearly as amusing to adults 

100.73 101.67 B: right 

101.07 107.99 A: um one of the things i find interesting is i enjoy the simpsons a- as i notice all my comedy references are television 

105.65 106.59 B: yeah 

107.84 117.99 A: probably doesn't say really great things about me but um a- and i c- it it amazes me when people let children watch the simpons it just does not seem like a children's program to me at all 

109.79 111.65 B: mine too [laughter] 

117.64 118.58 B: right 

118.17 119.77 A: um because it is 

119.90 124.41 A: quite frequently crass i wouldn't want to be explaining to children 

124.47 131.22 A: a lot of the jokes on the simpsons but i don't personally find it offensive for me just not child appropriate oh 

126.04 127.09 B: exactly 

129.11 129.90 B: no 

131.72 133.07 B: no um 

133.69 139.45 B: there are com- comedians out there that you know do the racial thing the racial slur 

139.64 141.35 B: i don't believe that [noise] 

141.98 151.20 B: excuse me [laughter] i don't think that should be included you know i think comedy can be funny without putting people down in a racial sense 

151.11 152.39 A: (( right )) 

151.46 155.81 B: you know if you're bringing up a situation where you've been in i believe that's okay but 

155.72 160.67 B: you know what i'm saying like a child heard situation or something you've been through personally 

160.55 170.83 B: but directing different races or things like that taking advantage of that to make people laugh i don't you know i don't really get that a lot of times 

170.15 174.90 A: yeah that is a very delicate line one one i would stay far far away from 

171.82 172.85 B: [laughter] 

174.22 175.62 B: mhm 

175.92 179.76 B: what kind of comedians do you like i mean who who are some of your 

180.20 189.56 A: um i i actually love robin williams although a lot of his work leaves me flat especially some of the later stuff but his earlier stuff um 

182.34 183.48 B: (( i do too )) 

184.21 185.22 B: i do too 

189.80 201.60 A: i think in high school we used to listen to i think it was called robin williams at the met over and over and over which looking back now i think maybe that wasn't age appropriate for high school students but we thought it was a riot [laughter] 

194.80 196.59 B: [noise] 

200.03 200.90 B: (( [laughter] )) 

201.11 203.75 B: right tha- that's what um 

204.61 206.53 B: we liked eddie murphy back then 

206.56 207.96 B: you know and of course 

208.47 211.72 B: he's not age appropriate for high school students either 

212.06 224.95 B: he can get quite offensive you know especially for younger kids that don't understand what he's really talking about i think that's part of it is understanding the material you know before you can draw a line [laughter] 

217.42 218.44 A: right 

224.11 225.14 A: right 

225.35 226.20 B: (( but um )) 

226.28 229.12 B: i really like robin williams and ah 

229.21 238.64 B: i think the things he talks about he takes world problems and tries to make us laugh about it and feel good about it i don't think he tries to offend anyone 

238.41 239.77 A: mhm 

239.54 240.58 B: um 

240.66 242.56 B: i've also seen damon wyans 

242.65 249.91 B: i think he's really good and he can be offensive [laughter] but in a way he he makes it funny too you know 

250.61 253.74 B: but i don't know um 

255.11 258.29 A: they're not straight out comedy but i love penn and teller 

258.13 259.91 B: yeah they're good 

258.83 260.91 A: cannot get enough penn and teller 

260.96 265.12 B: yeah i i watch a lot of the comedy channel do you ha- get that 

264.67 266.46 A: (( no no i don't )) 

265.87 275.71 B: they have some um really good comedians that can just bring it out you know like robin williams can and turn things around that then there's some that just 

275.72 278.46 B: you know talk about stuff that [laughter] 

278.56 283.25 B: you know just doesn't really need to be talked about to make people laugh but 

284.01 290.51 B: i i don't know there's there's really like you said a fine line i think it depends on the personality of the person 

289.92 297.62 A: well and and it entirely depends because i i can't for a moment deny that south park is offensive but i love it 

296.26 297.97 B: right i do too 

297.68 301.08 A: absolutely adore it because it it's done 

298.44 299.37 B: [laughter] 

301.60 305.49 A: it's done well i mean it's equal opportunity offensive 

305.40 309.90 B: right and it's everyday life some of it's everyday life you know what i'm saying especially 

309.93 316.31 B: you know when you were in high school and it sometimes it brings back memories of things that you did stupid stuff that you did 

316.37 317.47 B: but 

317.48 320.29 B: you know it's really i think it's hilarious 

320.09 322.44 A: anyone who can come up with underpants gnomes 

321.96 323.36 B: [laughter] 

322.56 324.55 A: i'm on it i'm there 

323.83 325.26 B: exactly 

325.27 326.96 B: it's hilarious 

327.35 329.88 B: but actually what's another show um 

331.42 332.95 B: i'm trying to think 

333.01 335.20 B: now how do you like saturday night live 

335.15 338.37 A: you know i used to watch it just loyally 

338.51 340.48 A: um but now 

340.49 353.54 A: i i have to say that i've i rarely catch it because you know it seems to go through phases it'll be really good and then really bad and i feel they're going through a a not so impressive phase right now although it's been so long since i've watched it they could be brilliant again and i wouldn't know 

346.61 347.48 B: mhm 

353.85 357.23 B: yeah a lot of that i think has to do with cast too [laughter] 

356.72 363.11 A: ah the cast and the writers and right now i well i can't say right now very fairly but the last time i watched it 

358.04 359.00 B: yeah 

363.65 367.20 A: it there was just you know the sketches dragged on way too long 

367.60 370.55 A: they were a little too predictable 

370.23 373.63 B: and not very funny in the comedian sense they're just 

372.80 375.12 A: yeah yeah they've lost that edge 

374.75 379.14 B: yeah you know and sometimes less is more you know like they say 

379.20 384.04 B: sometimes just the acting out can be more funny than than all the talking that they do 

383.77 385.14 A: mhm 

384.24 388.52 B: especially like mad t._v. i don't know if you've seen that either but that is just ooh 

389.03 398.74 B: sometimes that to me is not as classy as saturday night live not that saturday night live is classy but you know what i'm saying it's not as i guess the writers aren't 

399.27 412.88 B: as in-depth with some of their stuff it's just they take whatever is in the topic and you know in the world and they make fun of that or they make fun of singers a lot of the times and and sometimes it's okay and 

401.27 402.61 A: mhm 

412.78 416.96 B: (( sometimes it's just not funny you know [laughter] it's not comedy )) 

414.40 415.19 A: mhm 

417.07 422.64 B: but i think the old time comedians are the best you know like you said robin williams and people like that 

422.21 425.52 A: monty python never get tired of monty python 

423.22 424.94 B: yeah [laughter] 

425.20 435.38 B: i think the older ones are better and i think they come across with their messages about you know there's a message there you know trying to make people feel good try- that's really what comedy is about 

431.40 432.72 A: mhm 

435.34 448.81 B: you know not trying to get one race mad at another race and i mean i i love black comedians don't get me wrong i love them but sometimes they can really toss it out there [laughter] you know and things like that but 

448.92 452.38 B: it's just i guess it's like i said the personality and the person 

452.50 459.69 B: that that really has to accept what's being said and you know and get the message and understand the comedy 

460.51 464.38 B: but i'm like you it's just robin williams is hilarious 

464.99 466.53 A: hard to go wrong with him 

466.33 467.02 B: no 

467.41 469.65 B: i've se- have you seen him recently 

469.30 472.49 A: no i haven't actually i think ah probably the last 

473.12 480.55 A: i'm not sure what was the last thing i saw him in because a lot of his movies run together these days because there's he's kinda he's got a shtick going at this point 

480.19 483.84 B: [mn] he had a a h._b._o. about comedy um 

480.62 481.70 A: (( but um )) 

483.09 485.46 A: i did wanna see that and i haven't 

484.92 489.38 B: tha- oh i cried i was in tears laughing so hard i mean 

489.63 494.04 B: i really was and it was just really good comedy and 

493.65 495.97 A: i should make a point of renting that 

494.81 498.41 B: it was just the old you know i mean it was just him 

498.61 503.93 B: and you know when he when he messes up or drops a bottle of water he turns that into a joke 

503.63 505.22 A: mhm 

503.94 506.71 B: you know he just can't go wrong [laughter] 

505.81 512.21 A: well he does he's someone that i think if you had to spend time with him in real life he'd probably drive you insane 

511.89 513.35 B: but you know i've heard 

512.33 515.18 A: but on stage he's brilliant absolutely brilliant 

514.65 516.58 B: i've heard that about him um 

516.76 524.88 B: someone was talking about how they were trying to do an interview with him and he just went completely off off the subject he did not answer personal questions 

525.00 528.39 B: you know he doesn't talk about his private life so he'll just 

527.56 529.10 A: (( you know fair enough )) 

528.81 541.34 B: yeah exactly he just completely turns it around and goes somewhere else you know like he'll start screaming oh my god there's ninjas on the line and you know out of this world stuff [laughter] and you have to laugh 

541.71 544.34 B: because that's just you know the way he is 

544.36 550.46 B: but i really i really like his h._b._o. special if you ever get a chance you need to see that especially if you like him 

548.74 549.82 A: yeah should make 

550.25 553.13 A: a yeah i do i should make a point of seeing if it's on video 

552.73 557.33 B: it was really good i don't know it should be it should be on video 

557.83 558.79 B: um 

559.01 562.68 B: but that was probably about a year ago when i'd seen it maybe six months ago 

562.37 564.94 A: okay do you enjoy life comedy at all 

563.06 563.74 B: it was 

565.03 568.19 B: i have actually only been to a comedy club once 

568.26 576.23 B: [laughter] i just don't have the time to go and it to me it wasn't as the the person that i saw was not really that funny 

575.81 577.41 A: mhm 

576.31 577.51 B: it was like f- f- 

577.70 583.47 B: you know when they're out there and they're trying trying to get you to laugh to me when they're trying too hard it's not funny 

580.87 582.45 A: right 

583.58 587.30 B: when it's just in their blood to do it you know that's when it's hilarious 

585.76 599.89 A: yeah yeah you know most i i do have it's not quite the same thing but i'm not a huge fan of adam sandler he has his moments but i used to love it on saturday night live when he would crack himself up most of the time i have no patience with comedians who 

592.74 593.83 B: mhm 

596.94 597.89 B: yeah
