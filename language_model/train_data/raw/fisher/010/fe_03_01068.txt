49.65 50.30 A: sorry 

50.87 52.22 A: um it 

52.91 54.96 A: but i also think that um 

55.99 57.89 A: that also depends on 

58.77 59.24 A: uh 

61.43 65.10 A: oh i don't know how to explain it but i guess kind of like um 

67.33 68.73 A: whether you're in 

69.16 72.25 A: company of people you know that would be offended 

72.19 72.61 B: yeah 

74.17 75.30 A: and um 

76.53 78.56 A: especially like with men and women 

78.80 79.19 B: uh-huh 

79.81 81.33 A: like probably a group of guys 

81.75 84.11 A: probably talk totally different than they would and 

84.27 85.57 A: think something is funny 

86.00 86.79 A: versus 

87.62 88.49 A: a group of girls 

88.66 88.99 B: uh-huh 

90.64 90.94 B: i was 

91.03 92.03 B: i would definitely say that 

92.87 93.15 B: you know 

94.00 95.03 B: say it's true the other way 

98.98 100.00 A: probably 

100.60 103.14 A: yeah probably 

103.30 105.35 A: there's just also 

105.45 105.96 A: i mean 

107.14 107.60 A: with 

107.93 109.88 A: the gender differences 

110.07 110.43 B: uh-huh 

110.58 111.18 A: i mean 

111.61 116.18 A: some of the things that women find funny that men would probably not even understand 

116.46 116.81 B: right 

117.35 118.16 A: so 

117.90 118.80 B: the old thing about the 

122.02 125.65 A: i would agree with that 

122.38 123.24 B: (( )) 

124.36 127.49 B: yeah i'm not a fan myself but 

127.63 128.84 B: you kind of see how 

131.97 132.66 A: hm um 

132.34 134.69 B: your description of the dividing line between the 

136.68 137.59 A: exactly 

137.59 137.92 B: yeah 

137.97 138.81 A: like um 

139.34 140.96 A: i know that like bill 

141.19 143.52 A: bill cosby can be hilarious 

143.52 144.14 B: uh-huh 

144.11 148.22 A: talking about family um i haven't seen it but i heard that bi- 

148.39 150.68 A: bill cosby himself is just hilarious 

150.92 151.29 B: uh-huh 

151.73 152.93 A: and that um 

154.30 158.85 A: if i'm not mistaken i don't think he uses a lot of derogatory language 

158.98 161.09 B: oh no it's that's his whole thing is he can 

161.27 165.60 B: he like challenges himself to find way to kind of keep it clean and still be 

166.67 172.06 A: right versus i think um from what i understand with um 

172.70 174.23 A: robin williams 

174.88 176.48 A: with his most recent thing 

176.67 177.90 A: he got pretty 

178.66 179.71 A: far out there 

180.58 184.00 A: as far as language and a lot of in- 

184.43 185.00 A: um 

185.44 187.72 A: i guess innuendos and things like that 

188.78 189.44 A: uh so 

190.46 193.66 A: i mean i kind find comedy in things like that 

193.86 194.21 B: uh-huh 

194.85 196.36 A: i mean to a certain point 

197.06 199.45 A: and than after a while it just kind of gets old 

199.53 199.82 B: yeah 

200.16 200.55 B: it can get 

200.79 201.67 B: get boring i think 

202.60 203.15 B: (( i think there gets )) 

203.41 206.40 B: to be like so much comedy on t._v. and um 

208.88 210.48 B: so popular um 

211.54 216.49 B: sometimes you watch a comedy show and you can't believe that anybody is laughing because you've you've heard the exact same thing 

217.03 217.84 B: before and 

223.29 224.09 A: uh right 

224.61 226.10 A: well um 

226.75 227.38 A: i like

242.35 243.34 B: i haven't been up that late 

245.42 248.63 A: but at the same time dave letterman 

248.79 251.32 A: has been out because he's had the shingles 

251.59 252.53 B: oh yeah yeah 

252.21 255.24 A: and so um whoopi gold goldberg 

255.75 256.78 A: had um 

257.07 258.08 A: filled in for him 

258.30 258.87 B: oh really 

258.83 259.63 A: and 

260.62 262.69 A: they were making a joke about 

262.79 263.20 A: or 

263.45 266.08 A: whoopi made a joke about um 

267.08 268.51 A: about how we have 

268.94 269.49 A: um 

270.11 271.33 A: th- three people

281.75 282.65 A: colin powell 

282.77 283.15 B: uh-huh 

283.57 284.31 A: and then 

284.50 288.68 A: but jimmy kimmel's cohost made the same exact joke 

289.47 293.89 A: his night but there was no way either one of them could see each other's show 

293.95 294.74 B: right 

295.54 296.10 A: i mean 

295.81 296.27 B: yeah 

296.63 298.44 A: i don't know i guess they think 

299.04 302.53 A: i guess people who are in comedy think along the same lines 

302.51 304.26 B: yeah i think that they i think they 

304.56 306.46 B: you can kind of run into formula 

307.60 309.16 B: um or or the 

309.90 311.22 B: yeah i've i've seen that 

311.36 312.51 B: that happen to like 

312.69 313.37 B: leno and 

314.21 315.78 B: and letterman's monologue 

319.40 322.35 A: oh ri- see i just i can't watch jay leno 

322.53 322.89 B: oh yeah 

323.02 326.20 A: i just i don't know i just don't find him funny 

327.75 331.28 B: he used to be really funny like when he would appear on letterman 

333.80 334.35 A: uh-huh 

334.15 335.77 B: i remember thinking he was really funny 

336.05 337.24 B: and yeah i mean he's 

337.43 338.82 B: he's my least favorite of the 

339.93 341.76 A: i and i don't know why 

342.11 342.49 A: i 

342.65 343.04 A: i 

343.61 348.50 A: i don't know i guess i've always been partial to dave letterman and i guess that's maybe 

348.88 352.21 A: when all that happened between n._b._c. and c._b._s. 

351.92 352.34 B: right 

352.48 353.12 A: all that 

353.95 354.29 A: i would 

354.40 357.03 A: think that's still along the lines of comedy wouldn't you think 

357.31 357.93 A: uh 

357.74 358.75 B: yeah 

358.99 362.23 B: and it's strange that you know it would make one like choose 

364.32 365.14 B: like you'd think that 

365.96 367.11 B: i know exactly what you're talking 

376.74 376.99 A: oh 

377.66 378.54 A: ah right 

378.42 380.81 B: really it should just be like you know who's funnier 

381.65 382.87 A: exactly and (( )) 

383.03 385.65 A: i personally think dave letterman is but 

386.17 386.70 A: you know 

387.36 388.04 A: i don't know 

389.16 391.98 A: so do you go to comedy clubs or anything like that 

392.22 392.77 B: um

401.16 404.15 A: well no i've well i've been to one a coup- i went to

407.46 407.82 B: uh-huh 

407.88 409.97 A: but so uh 

410.67 412.26 A: and usually they're pretty funny 

412.57 412.89 B: uh-huh 

413.24 413.76 A: um 

415.10 417.74 A: but i know but what about um 

418.49 420.91 A: you know how they're stretching the comedy into 

421.03 423.30 A: like reality t._v. with um 

425.15 427.08 A: oh celebrity mole 

428.10 429.10 A: did you see that 

429.09 430.24 B: saw a little bit of that 

430.30 433.93 A: i didn't i didn't watch it i liked the mole when it was on 

434.01 434.41 B: uh-huh 

435.18 435.75 A: um 

436.13 437.07 A: as far as the 

437.29 443.46 A: reality t._v. but when they did the celebrities i didn't watch it but i remember cathy griffin was in there she's a 

444.63 445.32 A: comedy 

445.48 446.87 A: person do you know who she is 

447.56 450.23 B: i know the name i but i can't can't picture the face with it

452.89 453.78 A: and she's 

454.65 456.40 A: um pretty obnoxious i think 

456.57 456.93 B: uh-huh 

458.29 459.98 A: because oh um 

461.57 465.89 A: i guess they're trying to stretch that into reality t._v. as well 

471.90 473.26 A: oh i know 

473.81 474.63 B: like they have like 

475.22 478.13 B: two or three main ideas for shows and then they keep mixing 

480.52 481.31 A: uh yeah 

481.43 482.32 A: exactly 

483.33 483.85 A: so 

484.44 486.52 A: um i assume they'll tell us when we're 

487.68 489.27 A: when there's been time 

489.60 493.05 B: oh yeah i think you're supposed to talk for about ten minutes and then it just kind of cuts 

493.66 494.16 B: all though 

494.52 495.06 A: does it 

495.13 496.72 B: yeah it have you done this before or 

496.55 497.24 A: no 

497.38 497.67 B: yeah

508.66 509.72 B: first time i don't think i 

515.86 517.41 B: (( )) i think you're supposed to 

517.52 518.30 B: talk for (( )) 

518.90 520.59 B: ten minutes and then the next time 

520.74 524.93 B: after we were talking for a while it just kind of like cuts you off in the middle like a like a phone card 

526.67 527.60 A: oh okay 

527.85 528.30 B: um 

528.15 529.95 A: so they'll cut us off whenever
