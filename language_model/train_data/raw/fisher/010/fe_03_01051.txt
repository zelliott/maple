94.59 95.84 A: inappropriate comedy 

96.28 99.40 A: that you know are are children are exposed to it 

100.22 102.78 A: constantly and we don't seem to have much control over

143.74 147.42 A: he's a senior this year in high school and then my youngest one is a fifth grader 

147.97 152.22 A: and that that makes it somewhat difficult as well because some of the things that um 

152.66 155.76 A: that he brings into the house it's hard to keep away from 

156.51 157.30 A: the younger one 

157.93 159.14 B: oh definitely i mean 

159.26 159.59 B: (( )) 

159.71 163.47 B: what is the what is that movie um a a jackass 

163.62 166.67 B: uh which is basically targeted towards very young 

166.79 167.57 B: teenagers 

167.96 169.76 B: which is so inappropriate 

170.03 170.42 A: right 

170.17 178.03 B: um and you know with you having your (( )) kids at that age i mean that's just so targeted towards them and is so inappropriate that 

179.09 182.57 B: you know i i just can't see you know th- you know money talks 

183.02 184.04 B: (( )) 

183.23 186.99 A: the- they incorporate uh that sort of thing even into 

187.45 188.62 A: video games these days 

188.81 189.15 A: you know 

189.54 190.58 B: yes exactly 

191.26 199.98 B: exactly i mean um my neph- yeah i have a thirteen year old nephew and he- you even though it has a parental symbol on it you get it and it's still bad 

200.35 200.88 B: um 

200.38 200.76 A: right 

201.22 205.51 B: you know (( )) i guess monsters inc. is uh the one that kind of uh 

205.88 211.54 B: (( )) watched that with my son and he uh basically you can't scare kids anymore because their so 

211.93 214.33 B: you know numb to anything frightening 

215.29 217.16 B: uh it's it's just so hard 

217.65 218.10 A: yeah 

218.34 219.67 B: monsters inc. kind of like 

219.89 221.92 B: gets that hits that right on the head right there 

222.78 223.19 B: so 

224.12 225.31 B: (( )) 

225.64 226.85 B: how long are we supposed to do this 

227.39 229.15 A: i think eight minutes 

228.81 231.91 B: eight minutes okay this is my first call 

229.51 237.46 A: um yeah it's mine too so i'm sure it can minutes probably seems like a very long time where you're 

236.54 238.38 B: yeah i i didn't even start timing yet 

239.61 241.06 B: i have no idea but um 

240.39 244.18 A: i don't know if somebody comes on and tells us that we can stop or what 

243.85 246.67 B: oh i have no idea but uh we'll probably 

246.89 250.35 B: have to just continue talking until kind of figure it out um 

250.81 251.53 B: but um 

252.14 253.49 B: appropriate comedy 

254.10 256.72 B: i mean i don't know if there is a- any um 

257.66 260.66 B: any around really i i haven't 

260.79 265.45 B: i haven't seen any comedy shows that are eh actually really appropriate unless you turn on disney 

266.29 267.26 A: yeah 

267.61 268.37 B: and that's it 

270.64 271.27 A: yeah 

270.82 271.23 B: (( )) 

271.55 271.88 B: yeah 

272.09 272.46 B: so 

273.48 278.76 B: um i don't know what else to say about appropriate inappropriate uh comedy i mean 

279.09 281.04 B: it's all there (( )) inappropriate 

281.62 282.00 A: right 

282.22 283.16 B: in my opinion 

283.52 283.91 B: so 

285.28 288.03 A: well the the p._g. thirteen movies is a big 

288.27 289.85 A: bone of contention with me because 

290.19 291.60 A: you think that you're getting 

292.00 292.65 A: something that 

292.75 294.61 A: is appropriate for your child to watch and 

294.81 296.23 A: p._g. thirteen doesn't really 

297.43 300.99 A: i mean the rating system is i don't know who sets those but 

302.12 308.06 B: uh it's probably somebody who uh is probably a lot younger than us and uh think it's appropriate they think it's going to be funny 

308.47 311.83 B: (( )) but they know that the kids are going to be able to get into those um 
308.74 309.57 A: yeah 

312.04 312.97 B: into those movies 

313.55 314.00 A: right 

314.19 315.77 B: yep so um 

317.43 321.06 B: you know something around the you know in the office that's 

321.19 326.44 B: appropriate is you know i don't think anything really any kind of joke nowadays can be appropriate just because 

326.54 328.98 B: there's always something there is alway a meaning behind them 

329.49 331.57 B: so you just gotta be gotta be a 

329.78 330.14 A: right 

331.84 333.23 B: careful in how you do that 

334.21 334.64 B: so 

334.39 335.95 A: what do you what do you think about 

336.79 340.19 A: certain comedians like oh richard prior 

341.45 342.76 A: george carlin or 

343.47 346.16 B: you know the only one that i like is um 

346.38 347.14 B: robin williams 

348.11 348.89 A: robin williams 

348.21 351.32 B: i think he's a yeah i think he is a riot 

352.31 356.97 B: eh but that's for me it's not like for my nephews they probably won't get half the stuff 

357.39 358.50 B: that there talking about 

357.50 357.98 A: right 

358.80 359.41 B: um 

359.97 365.16 B: ca- uh comedians um are for an older generation i don't think they're for a younger generation 

365.55 366.00 A: yeah 

366.08 371.55 B: i mean th- the guy that i can't remember his name but the one that smashes the um watermelons 

372.24 372.92 A: oh 

373.07 373.47 B: yeah 

373.13 374.81 A: yeah i know is that george carlin 

374.97 375.93 B: is that george carlin 

375.04 375.45 A: is that 

376.17 377.95 B: yeah i i think that is 

376.40 376.66 A: i 

378.71 379.21 A: okay 

379.34 381.69 B: yeah i think that is 

382.13 387.59 B: (( )) i think that's who it is but you know i haven't seen him in ages um probably about ten years ago and uh 

388.02 392.36 B: i don't even think that was appropriate and there was a bunch of kids in the uh in the audience when i saw it 

392.85 393.27 A: right 

393.43 395.22 B: you know but some c- 

396.27 398.38 B: some of them are a little way out there 

398.66 401.15 B: um but 

401.51 402.25 A: one that i 

401.61 402.27 B: i have (( )) 

403.25 403.69 B: (( )) 

403.26 405.88 A: one of them that i can't stand is uh jim carey 

406.22 408.89 B: oh i don't like him at all i never see any of his movies 

407.96 408.51 A: i can- 

409.08 410.93 A: me either i cannot stand him 

411.09 416.03 B: yeah i don't neither can i oh terrible all those stupid movies um 

416.51 418.28 B: i can't even remember half of them but 

417.50 420.07 A: ace ventura pet detective and 

419.85 420.97 B: exactly 

420.96 422.28 A: liar liar and 

421.08 421.52 B: yeah 

422.88 423.23 B: yeah 

422.93 424.61 A: cable guy and 

424.82 428.23 B: yeah i think those are probably targeted towards young kids cause they're stupid funny 

428.55 430.70 B: and you know are they are they 

428.61 429.24 A: yeah 

430.82 432.97 B: is is that good comedy i don't think so 

433.39 434.39 A: no i think 

433.49 433.81 B: (( )) 

434.23 434.48 B: (( )) 

434.58 440.72 A: there's so many inappropriate innuendos in a lot of it you know that maybe you know the younger kids don't understand but once they get 

441.18 442.66 A: you know to be about thirteen 

442.80 444.57 A: they understand what it means and 

445.98 448.59 B: oh exactly yeah i mean they go and see it again 

447.31 447.81 A: (( )) 

448.71 454.17 B: because they're like oh what's they meant and you're all going oh no this you know this is not good 

449.11 449.57 A: right 

454.14 454.64 A: right 

454.46 454.94 B: um 

455.24 457.24 B: yeah there's i don't think there's really anything that's 

457.43 457.84 B: (( )) 

458.22 460.61 B: appropriate for any kid out there nowadays 

461.19 461.70 B: um 

462.67 466.90 B: an- but there's you know hardly anything you can do about it cause were not part of the rating system 

467.12 468.43 B: when it comes to um 

468.78 470.19 B: what our kids can see 

470.52 474.04 B: except keep (( )) away from but we know they all sneak away and do it anyway 

470.64 471.00 A: right 

474.42 474.84 A: right 

474.67 476.19 B: my nep- i mean my nephews do 

476.87 477.35 A: yeah 

476.97 477.38 B: so 

477.58 477.97 B: (( )) 

478.29 480.49 B: and i'm sure we did to when we were younger 

481.48 487.25 B: but i don't think they were as bad i sound like a typical mother 

481.65 483.61 A: yeah probably 

484.92 485.73 A: no 

487.17 491.66 A: i know i well i agree i don't think it was either at least i'm

502.00 503.94 A: i mean some of the sitcoms even are just 

505.48 508.85 A: its its um embarrassing to sit down with your child and watch that stuff 

508.84 509.15 B: (( )) 

509.57 509.90 B: yep
