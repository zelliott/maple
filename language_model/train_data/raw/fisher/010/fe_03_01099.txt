180.00 181.20 B: (( yeah but mm )) 

180.10 185.91 A: i i guess if i have my dream my dream my truly dream thing it would be to work with horses because i'm a horse nut 

185.87 187.64 B: oh are you yeah 

186.73 187.63 A: (( yeah )) 

187.84 189.41 A: (( um i a )) 

188.96 190.75 B: people in our neighborhood have horses 

191.41 195.85 A: lot of money and ah a lot of time but ah if i could ah 

196.59 200.45 A: i if i didn't have to worry about anything else then ah [laughter] 

199.69 209.49 B: yes if that if that was your job that you were going to and you had to get up and muck the stalls you c- and you were making money on it you could always have somebody come in and do that part for you [laughter] 

206.60 208.26 A: exactly yes 

208.52 210.00 A: [laughter] 

209.67 219.22 B: because i was raising birds and that's why i gave my birds up because i spent forty minutes every day in the morning and forty minutes every day you know evening 

215.61 216.29 A: oh 

219.15 219.90 A: (( oh )) 

219.23 224.54 B: cleaning cages and watering and feeding it's just i got to the point where it wasn't enjoyable 

224.46 228.98 A: no i i i can imagine that's a it became more of a chore than anything 

224.65 225.72 B: (( but it [mn] )) 

227.40 231.35 B: it wasn't a money maker [laughter] [laughter] you know 

230.86 231.44 A: (( else )) 

231.54 234.61 A: goodness but now look you've got you've got quite a a 

234.79 238.00 A: any type particular breed of cats you have now or just anything 

237.99 246.03 B: no right now i have anything i have a lot of drop offs and strays and and that's another thing i had also given a good deal of consideration 

246.55 248.92 B: maybe opening some sort of um 

249.69 260.04 B: what do you call it like a place where they keep throwaways rescue yeah a rescue center there you go [laughter] because i pretty much have it already the three dogs we have ah were all dropoffs 

251.32 252.24 A: rescue 

260.09 260.90 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

260.20 268.77 B: and out of my twenty cats i have two that were actually my own and the rest were found in the woods or dumped off on the side of the street and just 

267.90 269.98 A: oh no ah 

268.99 271.83 B: yeah i'm a i'm a soft heart [laughter] 

271.59 272.95 A: [laughter] 

274.18 275.39 A: (( well that's another )) 

274.66 279.82 B: probably not a good one to go into business for myself because i can see me giving giving my profits away 

279.66 284.42 A: thing yeah exac- or the cats would ah you know be spoiling it with t- with toys and ah 

284.48 287.25 A: (( extra additions to the house i mean i've seen ah )) 

284.74 285.62 B: (( [laughter] yeah mhm )) 

287.68 289.13 A: at least when i read 

289.15 291.15 A: (( i've seen people who have converted their )) 

291.73 294.49 A: homes and basically one big cattery 

292.80 300.54 B: oh yeah you put up the shelves and [laughter] they have their own chairs [laughter] yeah we serve them 

297.08 299.19 A: exactly yeah so okay 

299.66 300.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

300.51 302.23 A: [laughter] 

301.61 303.63 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

302.98 305.18 A: yes i have a magnet on my ah 

305.61 310.27 A: my refrigerator which says this house is owned by the ah the the felines of the family 

310.35 311.70 A: (( and and sometimes )) 

310.43 311.84 B: uh-huh true 

311.77 313.56 A: i do think it's very true 

313.60 314.70 B: it is true 

313.78 314.65 A: (( so )) 

315.47 318.36 A: but with the economy the way it is the ah 

318.64 322.42 A: the dream business i think unfortunately will have to wait ah [laughter] 

322.10 323.79 B: i know i know 

323.34 324.89 A: (( for a while with ah )) 

324.30 332.65 B: that's why this is an interesting topic because if they hadn't said it's money was no object then then you took the a lot more realistic 

332.50 333.53 A: (( oh yeah mhm )) 

333.23 344.18 B: and then i probably would do something with computers because i know i could get the financing for that a lot easier and i could set it up and it it would be a lot smoother and a lot more profitable 

339.25 340.00 A: yes 

344.18 345.77 A: (( yeah yes the )) 

345.06 349.40 B: if i was doing my dream job [laughter] well if 

349.69 351.29 B: would definitely be cats
