50.68 58.15 A: well it depends on how close of a friend they are i guess you know if it would be a family member like my mom and dad or something yeah i probably could do it then but

97.07 98.38 B: yeah 

98.18 103.07 A: but a family member yeah i i could see where i could do it for a family member 

103.87 112.21 B: yeah [laughter] i'm trying to find out if they want us to talk about i could tell an example of when i committed perjury [laughter] 

111.56 113.21 A: oh you did 

113.61 117.66 B: ah w- actually recently [laughter]

117.81 121.13 B: okay well um one of my friends 

121.95 123.62 B: is applying for a job 

123.51 124.61 A: uh-huh 

124.76 127.14 B: and they needed a reference for 

127.24 132.01 B: some whatever reason so they called me and i pretended to be a company or whatever 

131.82 133.65 A: oh 

134.34 142.37 B: or a representative from some company that she used to work for and she is a great worker and is absolutely outstanding 

143.45 144.43 A: (( well )) 

145.84 147.96 B: but [laughter] 

147.07 157.50 A: i could do that i mean yeah i i could do that i mean when i think of perjury i think of actually being in a courtroom and having to swear to tell the whole 

156.06 160.85 B: [noise] oh my god okay [laughter] yeah 

158.06 164.88 A: yeah you know it's swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and then it's like okay [laughter] 

164.37 171.04 B: okay now thinking about it that way no i'm not [laughter] if i had to lie to a company or whatever yeah that's fine 

166.78 169.31 A: [laughter] 

170.74 173.27 A: yeah that's a little bit different 

171.06 178.10 B: but if i had to actually get on the stand um no i'm not i don't care who it is [laughter] i'm not lying and 

175.81 177.43 A: right 

178.09 181.85 A: well see i don't know though it could be your parents or 

178.71 179.65 B: so 

181.73 193.29 B: uh-uh i'm sorry i'm not going to get on a stand and lie because my parents i know them they're really funny and they'll feel bad about me having lied for them so they'll tell someone and then i'll get in trouble 

182.98 184.62 A: (( oh )) 

188.61 190.45 A: (( yeah )) 

193.07 197.29 A: [laughter] yeah that would be a hard situation 

195.01 196.09 B: [laughter] 

197.23 199.39 B: [laughter] so 

197.96 200.57 A: that would be a hard situation 

200.28 205.15 B: no there's no way i would lie for them because they'd give it up [laughter] 

207.06 209.43 B: they'd rather just go ahead and get in trouble 

209.10 210.24 A: right 

209.63 211.53 B: (( than to corrupt their daughter )) 

211.33 213.11 A: [laughter] 

214.52 217.52 A: well that you know i that's what i said i mean 

218.45 220.11 A: doing things like 

219.37 220.82 B: [noise] 

220.92 225.46 A: helping somebody on an application or or saying you're somebody that you're not that 

225.70 231.62 A: that's a little bit easier than actually going to a courtroom or something and being on the stand i mean that 

228.53 229.66 B: [laughter] 

231.56 239.13 B: yeah that that's um a little hard i think like i said i i wouldn't even do it [laughter] for the family 

234.74 235.84 A: yeah 

237.52 239.42 A: [laughter] 

239.22 252.46 B: but yeah if somebody wants to call me about you know a job or anything like that i'm pretty easy to just go ahead and lie because occasionally it's oh you scratch my back i'll scratch yours situation 

252.04 254.14 A: yeah 

254.79 260.27 A: yeah but sometimes that i'll scratch your back if you scratch mine can get you in more trouble [laughter] 

259.74 261.59 B: [laughter] true true mhm 

260.81 261.90 A: [laughter] 

263.64 265.53 B: yeah like 

265.80 270.63 B: yeah now that i think about it if there's anything dealing with the government i'm not gonna mm mm because 

271.00 274.81 B: like if a friend was trying to get security clearance or something 

274.15 275.90 A: yeah 

274.86 278.06 B: and they asked me to lie i'd be like mm you're on your own buddy 

277.99 285.52 A: yeah well see that that's that's kind of what i think about it i mean i have a son that's in the marine corps and i know he has security clearance of like 

278.25 279.27 B: [laughter] 

285.86 291.58 A: it's really hard to do you know something like that like you say with the government or you know 

288.22 289.38 B: yeah 

292.86 297.08 A: that's entirely a different story [laughter] 

295.28 300.04 B: exactly [laughter] yeah i'm not mm mm not interested in that 

300.06 314.83 B: i'm not trying to get hauled in because i lied for somebody not to mention you know would it what does it say about you if you're trying to get security clearance and one of the people that you put down as a reference or whatever is trying to lie for you 

312.71 314.23 A: is lying for you 

314.29 319.69 A: yeah that you don't think about it that way but yeah you're exactly right 

322.86 323.67 B: huh 

324.85 326.13 B: okay so 

326.74 329.90 B: are there any more directions we could take this call 

329.69 331.01 A: i don't know 

330.06 332.79 B: anything well i think we're supposed to keep talking 

332.89 334.41 A: [laughter] 

335.14 340.09 B: [laughter] and i'm sure if they're taping this they're probably having a lot of fun at this point 

339.75 341.30 A: probably 

342.17 344.93 A: i don't know what else to say about it i mean 

345.74 348.37 A: i think we've pretty much covered it that 

349.43 350.44 A: you know 

350.59 359.76 B: yeah i wonder in how come they don't give any actual guidelines about that particular questions because you could take it in so many different ways now that you think about it 

359.41 362.36 A: yeah you're exactly right 

362.66 365.51 A: maybe that's why they want you to keep talking about it 

365.90 370.42 B: probably to see exactly how many different directions people will go with it 

368.01 369.82 A: (( [noise] )) 

370.50 371.65 B: [noise] 

371.98 375.35 B: let's see is there anything else i can think of about perjury 

375.64 377.05 B: (( hm i don't know i )) 

379.69 381.64 B: don't think you should lie to the government 

382.07 384.29 B: don't think you should lie in church 

384.92 386.19 B: [laughter] 

385.08 388.93 A: [noise] oh we didn't even hit the church thing but you're right i mean 

387.45 388.45 B: yeah 

390.13 391.50 A: it's just like 

391.73 397.01 A: how how do you want to say it blasphemous or something if you're in church and lying you know 

396.71 398.15 B: [laughter] yeah 

398.03 398.81 A: (( mm )) 

398.17 405.49 B: huh actually speaking of all that stuff that perjury seems to become pretty widespread [laughter] actually 

404.94 407.70 A: yeah it could be if you think about it 

407.81 411.58 B: because ah you know you've got the whole thing going on with the catholic church 

411.85 413.13 B: and 

413.85 420.05 B: just with um the possibility going on with this war that may be happening that people are 

417.55 418.30 A: (( mhm )) 

420.17 425.58 B: some people are saying that colin howell lied about the information he had and 

424.80 426.27 A: mhm 

426.30 438.21 B: the government the military is restricting their people from talking to anybody that's not in the military like ah i have people that i used to date [laughter] that are in the military and 

438.28 442.20 B: they've actually been restricted in what they're allowed to email about 

441.70 446.81 A: oh yeah i i i like i said my son's in the marine corps so yes 

447.62 448.48 B: (( oh )) 

447.64 449.99 A: i can totally believe that that's 

450.64 453.37 A: and some things that it's like 

453.59 461.82 A: people see all this stuff on t._v. and say well now how can you really conduct a war don't you think osama bin laden and all them are on t._v. watching what's going on 

461.83 465.30 B: that's what i would think personally [laughter] 

463.19 464.08 A: well 

464.56 465.92 A: they're only letting 

466.66 470.05 A: things on t._v. that they want them to see you know what i mean 

470.10 471.17 B: yeah 

470.29 471.54 A: so it's like 

472.18 476.14 A: yeah some of sometimes they only tell people in the in the service 

476.62 478.01 A: in the military 

478.97 486.66 A: limited as to what well okay we'll tell you this so even if you do have a security breach or you happen to tell somebody 

486.83 489.19 A: it's not going to hurt anything you know what i mean 

489.08 490.13 B: mhm 

490.22 491.58 A: so [sigh] 

492.76 494.03 A: i don't know 

494.04 495.89 B: yeah me neither i don't know 

494.59 501.49 A: it's a totally different world out there [laughter] you could really go off on a lot of different sprees on perjury 

497.07 498.56 B: [laughter] 

502.21 504.25 B: [laughter] definitely 

505.21 506.27 B: (( i don't know )) 

506.34 507.20 B: (( i'm just )) 

508.48 513.24 B: see there's lying on job applications yourself uh [laughter] 

513.90 517.36 B: but then that doesn't include fam- friends and family i don't think 

514.05 515.42 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

517.97 519.35 A: well that's true [noise] 

520.62 525.20 A: it is a form of perjury but because you're even signing it saying that it's all 

526.24 528.88 A: [noise] true to the best of your knowledge [laughter] 

526.67 527.71 B: yeah 

528.24 531.46 B: [laughter] yeah at the bottom they have that little statement 

530.54 531.77 A: yeah 

531.93 537.44 B: so you know i was actually um like doing a job search right now and i was just reading an article 

537.55 540.90 B: about ah people that are applying to n._d._a. school 

540.71 542.16 A: mhm 

541.26 550.60 B: that have been lying on their applications and they actually just kick a bun- like they just kicked a bunch of applications at this one school i cannot remember the name my kids finished reading the article 

550.75 551.72 B: but 

551.64 552.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

552.21 560.53 B: they lied on their apps and of course they did an extensive extensive search and found that some people because they didn't want to see undesirable 

560.57 572.82 B: as far as applying they um they would expand what dates they were working and say they had been on work since march because they laid off and they'd say they had been there until november 

568.40 570.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

573.76 579.79 B: so you know the stuff that's pretty easily verifiable and i think they just thought that people weren't going to check 

579.29 581.76 A: [noise] [noise] yeah a lot of people do that 

581.93 584.78 B: yeah that's really strange to me [noise] 

585.33 589.46 A: well i i yeah well you know i graduated 

589.59 591.93 A: from college and they told us 

592.06 594.72 A: you know [laughter] it's funny 'cause 

595.08 596.36 A: the um 

596.64 599.89 A: person that was going over the teacher that was going over
