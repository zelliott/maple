316.38 317.12 B: that you were 

318.09 321.58 B: i think uh if i had to leave the united states i'd miss the food too 

321.34 322.86 A: oh i would miss the food 

322.89 325.11 B: i would miss the food a lot m- 

324.68 327.16 A: well we have so many things that we can choose from 

327.27 327.76 B: mhm 

327.75 329.66 A: and other countries don't have that 

330.12 331.94 B: absolutely absolutely 

331.04 331.38 A: and 

331.63 336.71 A: and they're tastes are so much different than ours 

333.96 339.74 B: oh i'll mm i'll definitely agree with that my husband went to saint kitt's and 

343.50 344.27 A: oh wow 

350.86 357.21 B: most of the people that went over there on business used to come back and and had gained weight and he lost weight while he was over there 

357.72 358.85 B: just because the f- 

357.94 362.28 A: the only vacation i've ever been on that i gai- i lost weight is that we went to spain one time 

362.44 362.75 B: mhm 

362.48 364.17 A: and i couldn't eat their food at all 

364.33 364.74 A: that was 

364.39 365.03 B: really 

364.97 370.82 A: so bad uh they eat everything practically raw or really hard 

368.88 369.52 B: ew 

370.06 372.45 B: it sounds disgusting 

371.53 374.51 A: other people say they like it but i didn't 

374.92 376.05 B: i i don't 

375.35 378.86 A: that that i lost about ten pounds then 

377.75 382.43 B: i don't see how you could i don't see how you could eat everything hard or i don't know 

381.68 382.81 A: well i don't know it just 

387.63 388.13 A: and 

391.61 394.40 B: oh my goodness oh 

392.18 395.88 A: oh wow i said i don't think 

395.97 398.03 A: so 

396.89 399.12 B: oh did you send it back or did you 

399.43 404.20 A: no i didn't do anything with it i just left it because its hard to communicate if you don't 

404.36 405.17 A: speak the language 

405.09 407.94 B: thats true and then what do they think and 

407.99 408.30 A: yeah 

408.70 409.63 A: so i 

409.00 411.01 B: and do they understand what you're saying 

411.18 411.97 A: probably not 

411.82 412.63 B: no 

413.13 417.32 A: i don't think that restaurant did the other ones a- actually i found most countries 

417.69 420.36 A: a lot of them speak english not everybody but a lot of them 

419.15 419.48 B: mhm 

419.88 420.30 B: mhm 

420.63 423.35 A: so thats course they all know three or four languages 

423.80 424.61 B: right 

424.59 426.76 A: which is something that we do lack here 

426.47 429.20 B: and i wish we did speak more languages here 

429.06 430.04 A: i know (( )) 

430.22 432.21 A: would help so much to be able to 

432.87 439.42 A: tell your children you know that this is so and so from so and so and you can go ahead and talk to them you know 

439.75 440.58 B: that's 

439.93 441.08 A: it'd just be wonderful 

441.01 447.43 B: absolutely absolutely n- now my my children's school is is actually integrating spanish into their 

447.68 448.40 A: oh they are 

447.80 452.39 B: into their um specials area so they get uh spanish c- class once a week 

449.88 450.39 A: mhm 

452.63 453.09 A: well 

453.19 455.00 B: for elementary school that's not bad 

455.23 456.89 A: no that's good actually 

457.07 458.07 B: you know 

457.08 464.18 A: and (( )) nowadays you really have to know how to speak spanish you don't have a choice 

460.43 462.36 B: don't you though eh 

462.47 473.85 B: no no but they're you know they're saying that in the united states within fifteen or twenty years i heard that um sixty percent of the population will be speaking um spanish 

474.12 474.79 A: oh wow 

475.13 476.18 A: i hadn't heard that one 

475.98 476.61 B: yes 

477.07 485.53 B: i heard that um on on some news program i can't even remember which channel we were on but we were listening to that and couldn't believe that that's what they're estimating 

486.27 488.80 B: so i thought that was that was quite interesting 

490.23 492.98 A: (( )) i hadn't heard that one my uh i would think though that 

491.29 491.67 B: mhm 

493.13 494.46 A: like when you go over to europe 

494.68 496.80 A: they don't speak spanish they they'll speak 

497.07 497.83 A: they speak 

497.97 503.49 A: english and german and russian and polish and all kinds of things but they don't speak spanish 

499.20 499.56 B: mhm 

502.17 502.59 B: mhm 

503.83 506.83 B: i that's because they're all coming over here 

505.85 510.75 A: possibility 

518.87 528.58 B: um with the different languages that you don't hear spanish spoken over in europe but you know that it is so prevalent here in the united states that's just such a strange dichotomy 

528.49 529.94 A: it certainly is 

529.56 529.97 B: mhm 

530.30 530.68 B: mhm 

530.61 534.22 A: i said well when you go over to to hawaii ha- have you been there 

534.24 536.01 B: i have not been to hawaii 

535.31 537.43 A: lot lot of japanese people there 

537.57 539.58 A: so that (( )) you hear you hear a lot of japanese over there 

539.65 540.41 B: really 

540.28 540.69 A: uh-huh 

541.79 542.60 B: oh 

541.82 545.81 A: and not hawaiian 

543.75 548.47 B: an- and that's interesting that they don't that there's no you know that you wouldn't hear a lot of that 

547.32 550.74 A: you do you hear you hear some hawaiian but but usually 

549.85 550.19 B: mhm 

551.00 552.28 A: japanese that they're speaking 

552.46 554.14 B: isn't that interesting well 

554.24 555.60 B: i guess that makes sense 

555.99 558.14 A: well they make all their they they can take 

558.40 560.99 A: see this is what i found out a couple things that i found out is 

560.86 561.13 B: mhm 

561.24 567.05 A: ju- it's very cheap for japanese to go to hawaii and it's very cheap for russians to go to egypt 

567.31 569.35 B: oh 

568.30 569.63 A: so that's why they do it 

569.74 571.84 A: that's their like their summer places 

572.08 573.24 B: i see 

573.47 575.50 B: i see oh that's interesting 

576.18 576.90 B: huh 

577.03 578.67 A: so but 

578.29 579.46 B: that's interesting
