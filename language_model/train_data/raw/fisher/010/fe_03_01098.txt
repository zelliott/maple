7.97 8.91 A: okay um 

9.71 11.75 A: well would i accept a million dollars 

12.07 13.38 A: to leave the united states 

14.19 14.69 A: um 

15.13 17.19 A: possible if i i probably would 

17.41 19.58 A: go to maybe europe somewhere 

21.48 28.93 B: yeah i was thinking the same thing like i don't know where i would go that is a lot of money i could probably live pretty good in south america or something 

28.40 30.54 A: yeah but it is something close 

29.09 30.16 B: uh-huh 

30.66 31.39 A: to um 

32.36 34.24 A: the way we live in america so 

34.44 36.20 A: you know maybe england somewhere 

36.40 37.80 B: right 

36.83 42.74 A: but i although i know i've you know i've heard that it is still is different very very different 

42.71 47.17 B: i don't (( )) the customs and they don't like americans (( )) so 

43.22 43.70 A: (( )) 

46.30 48.12 A: right 

48.66 50.67 A: but but they can deal i i guess 

51.21 52.00 B: yeah 

51.43 56.85 A: but a million dollars is a lot but i guess i don't know is it it's a lot and then it's a 

57.52 60.75 A: they said to never return like 

59.69 61.33 B: yes i guess 

61.35 62.49 A: being exiled 

61.51 66.46 B: you would never see your family and all that unless they visited you mhm 

64.81 65.34 A: right 

65.74 68.02 A: so then again i don't know 

68.25 79.22 B: yeah i don't know i guess i would probably miss you know like all the freedoms we have i don't know in other countries i i don't i guess that you have as much freedom freedom of speech and so forth 

78.57 79.24 A: right 

79.80 80.45 B: so 

80.25 84.30 A: and probable any being an american step on a lot of people's toes 

84.39 85.47 B: oh yeah 

84.57 84.97 A: not 

85.43 87.63 A: through through ignorance 

87.33 91.67 B: oh sure sure yeah so so you think you would do it 

91.29 95.80 A: i don't know and now that i think about it i think like i initialy said yes um 

96.36 98.67 A: because i wasn't thinking it would be a permanent thing 

99.50 101.20 A: but then not being able 

101.64 104.69 A: you know you would be restricted because you would never be able to come 
104.94 105.80 A: back over here 

106.21 108.76 B: right makes it s- (( )) 

107.20 107.70 A: and it's 

108.28 116.49 A: like never ever ever and it would be different if i was raised over there and i knew what it was like but i've never been i've never been anywhere outside of the country so 

127.19 127.86 A: yeah 

129.67 132.19 A: i know oh yeah i i've been to the bahamas before 

132.31 132.58 A: but 

132.99 133.99 A: that wasn't 

134.96 135.54 A: that wasn't 

135.77 137.82 A: you know that was like a vacation so 

138.02 148.55 B: exactly right so i guess it is kind of like a culture shock i guess when you get there and then you know i guess possibly in europe the money would be different and so that would 

138.13 138.74 A: (( but )) 

142.40 143.09 A: mhm 

147.53 150.80 A: right but the thing is like you can never return again that would be the 

151.81 154.15 A: the thing you know that 

153.27 154.88 B: it is kind of final yeah 

154.51 159.35 A: yeah it is final and then simply for a million dollars i don't have a million dollars now so 

159.69 160.98 A: i don't think it would make a difference 

161.33 165.11 B: right like would it be worth your freedom to you know make that decision you know 

164.52 165.07 A: right 

165.24 170.68 B: absolutely so so what would you miss if you did leave 

171.37 172.13 A: um 

172.78 174.39 A: if i i'd miss um 

175.51 177.93 A: well i know that i am originally from 

178.29 187.67 A: the west coast and i live in the east coast now so i already miss like the weather so i would miss little things like that like the what you are used what i am used to 

185.10 185.55 B: right 

188.05 190.33 A: and any time you have to make a change for something 

188.11 188.74 B: right 

190.68 192.09 A: that is always difficult 

192.27 194.86 A: and i've been in my new spot for um 

195.16 198.41 A: for about a year and a half and i'm still adjusting so 

198.88 201.37 A: it would probably take you know just as long like 

201.60 205.16 A: a lifetime like as many as years as you've been somewhere it would probably take that much 

205.69 206.42 A: more time 

207.16 208.86 A: to um adjust to somewhere new 

209.29 210.59 B: right 

211.20 214.29 A: so i don't know what i would miss and i don't know if i could say i'd miss 

214.55 215.06 A: something 

216.16 217.02 A: particular 

217.20 218.40 A: more but um 

219.57 220.04 A: but 

224.36 225.10 A: right 

226.07 226.57 A: right 

234.31 235.44 A: exactly 

235.54 238.89 B: (( me )) so 

239.03 243.58 B: um i know they were mentioning about things you wouldn't miss can you think of anything that 

244.12 244.71 A: um 

246.18 248.96 A: things i wouldn't miss i know um 

251.57 259.46 A: well ach i would say i think the b- a big issue over here is like the health-care system and how difficult it is 

257.82 258.69 B: oh sure 

259.91 267.13 A: to get decent he- health-care and and you know every day they are finding out more and more things of how like the insurance companies pay doctors 

267.58 267.98 A: um 

268.47 269.87 A: more if they find less 

270.11 271.85 A: you know or if they report less 

270.99 271.81 B: oh right 

272.04 273.76 A: so that kind of thing and i know 

273.93 279.02 A: like um i've heard that in other places when they have where they have universal 

279.43 279.81 B: mhm 

279.51 281.56 A: health health-care where it is not 

281.85 284.45 A: just going to one person's pocket then 

284.64 286.62 A: um or where there is not special interest 

287.04 288.16 A: then um it's 

288.33 293.62 A: better for your own safety -cause you know they like they like over here they keep us ignorant 

294.19 295.35 B: oh right 

294.42 294.80 A: and 

294.96 306.46 A: uh and then at the last minute a lot of people but usually the people who who survive are the ones who have money who who i guess directly pay for their health-care instead of relying on the insurance 

301.69 302.08 B: mhm 

306.80 311.77 B: so you might be okay with your million dollars 

309.37 310.48 A: right 

310.95 313.63 A: yeah i guess so huh 

312.65 317.71 B: uh-huh yeah i was thinking too i don't know um i know there's other 

317.96 320.52 B: a lot of prejudice and i don't know if um 

320.66 322.10 B: well maybe i would be 

322.40 322.95 B: i guess 

330.34 331.04 A: right 

335.00 338.02 A: yeah and if you weren't the victim 

337.47 343.23 B: right like i definitely wouldn't want to go to iraq or anything 

338.33 339.10 A: yes 

341.49 345.93 A: i know being an american not not as this point 

345.55 346.76 B: definitely not 

346.45 350.03 A: yeah i know that that is another issue and there's there's a whole 

350.29 352.82 A: a whole bunch of ups and downs but 

352.94 353.51 B: (( right )) 

353.28 355.89 A: i think my decision probably would just be to 

356.31 358.88 A: i wouldn't i probably would not accept the money 

359.32 362.62 A: because i would feel as if i would be exiled because all i know is 

362.99 363.31 A: is 

363.74 364.50 A: in america 

365.02 365.85 B: right 

365.78 366.98 A: and even if i were 

367.35 367.66 A: if 

367.76 369.70 A: if i were like on a different part 

370.03 377.95 A: like in a different state that i've never been to it still would be different because i would know i would know my basic rights and 

378.16 380.23 A: and the only adjustment i would 

380.54 387.31 A: have to make would be like the initial ones like where the streets are and and where the store is you know 

387.09 387.93 B: exactly 

388.05 388.50 A: so 

388.42 396.59 B: and i guess over here you always have that possibility that you could you know make a million on your own or win the lottery or so um (( and just )) 

393.90 394.80 A: mhm 

395.70 397.43 A: the good old american dream 

397.66 399.40 B: mhm exactly 

399.39 400.82 A: so the easy way out isn't 

399.55 400.44 B: so 

401.07 403.86 A: so easy all time i suppose 

411.50 412.18 A: right 

413.63 414.98 B: (( but )) 

414.05 416.87 A: so although they i mean it would up to you to not 

417.77 419.66 A: keep -em strangers but 

420.00 426.99 A: i mean you would have to know learn languages or possibly or you would have to make so much adjustments but 

427.15 429.29 A: this i think it is like i mean 

430.16 434.04 A: that is anywhere like you could on your own decide to move to a different country but 

434.59 436.74 A: but you know that you have that back in of 

434.63 435.20 B: right 

437.11 437.97 A: you can return 

438.36 440.44 B: right yeah and i 

438.45 439.11 A: so 

439.68 441.04 A: that is the difference 

441.30 446.13 B: yeah and i was thinking too like i'm married and i have a child and it is like i don't know it is you know 

446.33 450.97 B: uh if that would be accepted in another country i know a lot of countries you know don't 

451.37 453.12 B: i guess they don't uh 

454.14 464.25 B: promote people having children a lot i know like in europe a lot of people don't have children and the government like gives you money to actually have children and so forth so i don't know if that you know 

458.51 459.31 A: right 

461.53 462.54 A: yeah 

463.02 464.27 A: i think that is in um 

464.59 465.32 A: where was that 

466.93 468.31 A: i think you get money 

468.48 471.08 A: like i think that it is in china or japan i heard that 

471.46 472.04 A: you will get 

472.40 474.85 A: um money or a tax break or something 

475.24 477.31 A: um if you have less children or something 

477.52 478.46 B: right 

477.54 479.04 A: for population 

478.95 484.13 B: and i i think it is like i don't know if it is sweden or denmark or one of those countries that you know 

483.25 484.40 A: a smaller country 

491.06 493.03 A: oh really 

496.24 499.00 B: populations are kind of declining so 

497.81 499.97 A: how funny so they need to 

499.31 499.66 B: yeah 

500.25 502.68 A: to get more swedes or something 

502.30 505.11 B: right i guess so but 

504.44 505.13 A: wow 

505.33 508.08 B: yeah it's kind of a scary thing 

508.91 509.99 B: so 

509.49 512.67 A: so i don't know what what else we are supposed to talk about 

512.81 517.81 B: um i'm not sure and i haven't been timing this so i don't know 

516.21 517.58 A: i think i got the call about 

518.35 519.97 A: um seven minutes ago 

520.24 522.93 B: oh okay
