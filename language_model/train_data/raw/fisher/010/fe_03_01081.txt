19.82 22.51 A: so we're supposed to talk about perjury huh 

22.88 26.81 B: that's this is my first phone call so that's what he said 

26.54 30.22 A: kind of a random topic 

27.63 31.35 B: really 

31.68 33.59 A: have you seen chicago yet 

34.49 35.55 B: no i haven't 

35.46 36.42 A: the movie oh 

36.53 38.25 A: well the reason i brought that up is 

36.91 38.66 B: it's wonderful right 

38.91 43.39 A: well it was okay i i've seen other music- t._v. musicals i like better but 

43.98 44.42 A: you know 

45.23 46.99 A: i liked it 

46.29 46.83 B: yeah 

47.16 49.00 A: the thing is her um 

49.31 52.22 A: it's it's all about a court scene cause she killed a dude 

52.98 54.45 A: and then it her husband 

53.13 54.31 B: uh huh 

55.07 56.87 A: well he doesn't lie 

57.01 57.59 A: but 

58.58 60.35 A: he (( )) bends the truth 

60.46 61.96 B: he doesn't right 

61.78 68.56 A: it's like well technically that would be a lie but really it's not 

68.81 71.12 A: but 

71.29 75.95 A: what about you would you bend the truth in court to for someone you loved dearly 

76.83 78.07 B: um 

79.20 82.44 B: you know what that's a tough question i guess it would 

82.80 84.20 B: all depend on 

85.17 88.74 B: bending the truth as being what you know what i mean 

89.01 89.45 A: yeah 

89.84 90.45 B: um 

90.19 91.00 A: exactly 

91.78 93.11 B: you know i mean i 

93.30 97.11 B: i would think of myself as not committing perjury in court 

97.23 98.55 B: but if you know it was 

98.64 100.69 B: uh for my son for my 

100.82 103.17 B: mother or husband i don't know 

103.30 106.09 B: there might be a chance that i might bend the truth a little 

107.06 108.97 A: yeah it's one of those (( )) 

108.17 109.05 B: what do you think 

109.18 111.72 A: you have to look at the whole situation i think 

112.34 115.40 B: right it would depend on what you they were in court for 

112.60 113.32 A: and 

115.94 117.90 B: what the charge were 

118.33 121.70 A: how bad you're lying 

119.90 125.86 B: how right 

124.08 129.62 A: and it's one of those like do you consider just not saying something like 

130.18 131.60 A: omitting information 

130.44 131.86 B: right if you don't say 

132.35 132.94 B: right 

133.15 134.39 A: is that lying 

133.41 134.29 B: if you don't give 

134.82 136.55 B: i don't know they say you know 

137.33 142.64 B: some people say well if you don't say anything that's just as bad as lying 

147.55 148.22 B: really 

147.93 149.30 A: other than traffic tickets 

149.42 153.43 A: but we won't talk about that 

152.64 157.67 B: i haven't even (( )) well i had to go for um child support 

157.28 161.66 A: oh those aren't fun ones either to go for 

161.07 161.99 B: oh no 

162.11 163.73 B: and he was bending the truth 

164.51 167.97 B: oh unbelievably 

165.81 168.27 A: is that (( )) is like 

168.56 171.86 A: you're lying be quiet see that's another thing like 

170.26 171.11 B: right 

171.96 173.23 A: if you know that 

173.82 178.09 A: you know if you tell the truth it'll make you look bad and your child goes to someone else 

178.46 179.25 B: right 

179.39 179.88 A: you know 

180.54 181.70 B: oh yeah 

180.86 181.36 A: and uh 

181.49 184.11 A: i think there's situation like on a whole 

184.56 185.11 A: that 

185.55 190.37 A: you know this is the way the moral code is but i think there's a situation in which anything has 

190.54 192.63 A: deserves to be bent does that make sense 

192.93 193.50 B: yeah 

194.38 195.12 B: for sure 

194.80 195.15 A: you know 

196.19 196.97 A: cause i know that 

196.26 196.95 B: i agree 

197.53 198.31 A: if 

198.58 202.66 A: someone took my i mean was trying to take my kid away from me and 

202.92 210.07 A: it would be a matter of me lying or you know them taking my kid i know in a heartbeat i'd probably lie 

210.26 210.82 B: right 

211.65 213.39 B: well yeah i agree with you there 

211.71 212.33 A: but 

213.49 214.16 B: and um 

214.46 215.44 B: that's (( )) 

216.79 221.29 B: i was isn't personally involved but my husband about a year ago had to go to court 

221.73 223.10 B: for um 

223.79 229.94 B: defending our property and because we kept having things stolen from us he caught people in his truck 

230.14 236.18 B: uh tearing the ignition out i mean uh over and over and over again and 

232.49 232.94 A: (( )) 

236.74 243.76 B: nothing you know we called the police nothing would be done about it so he caught somebody outside one night and um 

244.37 247.73 B: he went to the front door with his gun in his hand and he shot 

248.27 250.84 B: bullet into the ground just to scare him 

251.28 251.76 A: uh huh 

252.04 255.44 B: and the person um went home and called the police and said 

256.09 261.67 B: he was taking a walk and a madman opened his front door and started shooting randomly at him 

260.04 261.27 A: oh no 

261.93 270.48 B: so he was taken so here my husband was the uh victim and all of sudden it was turned around and now he's you know the 

270.58 272.37 B: one that's being taken to court 

272.59 273.72 B: it was a mess 

274.57 284.93 A: but it's like the story you hear about the burglar that was breaking into a house and fell through the skylight and landed onto onto the kitchen thing and cut himself with a knife and sued the people for 

284.90 285.62 B: oh yeah 

285.05 287.39 A: him hurting himself it's like 

286.82 287.31 B: yep 

287.58 290.09 A: stupid people 

289.74 292.24 B: well my husband's attorney said that um 

292.82 297.22 B: if you're ever in the situation again and someone's stealing something from you 

297.41 297.88 B: uh 

298.03 301.38 B: some situations you're better off if you're going to shoot him shoot him dead 

301.93 302.60 A: yeah 

302.20 302.72 B: you know 

303.30 307.85 B: because otherwise they turn it all around and you know they'll all of sudden they're the victim and 

308.35 311.88 B: you know you're paying their uh wages and 

311.42 321.21 A: huh disability yeah it's amazing what people sue other people for like did you hear about the lady who wanted to um sue mcdonald's because her kid was fat 

313.99 314.50 B: right 

321.83 322.37 B: yeah 

322.63 323.23 B: yep 

324.44 324.98 B: yep 

325.23 326.19 A: it's the 

325.31 326.83 B: it's all mcdonald's fault 

338.63 339.97 B: right right 

339.46 344.92 A: you know she probably would have sued 'em for hurting her child's psyche or something but 

344.09 344.65 B: yeah 

345.50 349.48 B: you know as far as i'm concerned i mean it's not always black and white there's grey 

349.87 350.62 B: area 

351.20 351.83 A: yeah 

352.04 355.56 B: and the i mean that goes in court cases also 

356.54 357.06 B: so 

357.41 359.81 B: i don't know that's a tough one 

359.76 361.28 A: yeah it is 

361.46 363.64 A: of course you don't want to come out oh yeah i'd lie 

363.80 364.67 A: cause 

364.35 365.15 B: i know 

365.93 371.95 B: well i'm not actually lying i'm telling a little white fib 

375.60 382.55 A: to somebody else and you're like you know sometimes mommy has to tell things that aren't the truth 

381.50 384.64 B: right if you don't want their feelings 

389.72 390.05 B: yeah 

390.59 395.98 A: my mommy says that you're fat sweetie you don't say that in front of people 

396.09 397.70 A: jeeze

413.37 413.96 B: hoping 

414.20 416.70 A: i'm afraid for that stage

417.18 417.79 B: you have 

421.79 423.06 B: that sounds like my mom

427.84 431.13 B: you they say your kid is worse than you and you're going to have a 

431.67 433.48 B: mess on your hands
