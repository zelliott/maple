0.53 2.55 A: hi i'm maria wakefield 

2.38 4.30 B: hi i'm troy cox 

4.03 5.43 A: hi troy how are you 

5.51 6.99 B: well fine how about you 

6.84 7.90 A: pretty good 

9.22 11.70 A: so where do you draw the line on um 

11.98 14.27 A: acceptable and bad taste humor 

16.31 18.66 B: ah it's just a matter of time 

19.31 21.15 B: i think anything's on 

21.37 28.32 B: given enough time you know like a tragedy such as nine eleven right now would still be tasteless 

28.10 29.02 A: right 

29.29 31.09 B: (( and you know still [laughter] )) 

31.83 42.96 B: well actually it's still ah i guess pretty tasteless to make pearl harbor jokes so i guess there hasn't been enough time but i just about anything else i'm i'm not easily offended 

36.65 37.61 A: right 

41.39 47.45 A: yeah [noise] [noise] yeah i think i think too i think when there's like serious 

43.54 44.65 B: how about you 

47.87 49.79 A: things that um 

49.65 57.75 A: where many people are involved and many people have actually gotten hurt i i just think it's in bad taste to to make fun of it because i i think in a way 

57.61 68.06 A: um people are sort of expressing their own views which is okay to do but it may not be the view of the masses [laughter] and so i think it does i think that gets tasteless as well 

64.35 65.94 B: [mn] like 

67.74 73.50 B: i haven't been online today but i'm sure there's plenty of elizabeth small jokes out there 

72.53 75.17 A: oh i know [noise] that's awful 

73.83 77.41 B: but i yeah i would find that in very bad taste 

76.32 85.64 A: [noise] yes i would too because my mom talked to me about it this morning and she's like they found that girl and i had actually not even you know thought about it for a while 

85.65 97.90 A: and my first thought was well that's wonderful but then as soon as my mom told me that she that he ha- you know he thought he was jesus or something i thought you know here comes all of the jokes you know it's going to be terrible 

95.47 96.58 B: oh sure 

97.82 99.58 B: eventually yes [laughter] 

99.03 100.79 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

100.83 114.60 A: do you find that there's a problem um like say i don't know if you're married or do you have a girlfriend but say you take her out to a um a comedy act or whatever um what draws what do you think draws the line for that 

115.82 117.91 A: when you're going to go see a comedian 

119.93 122.02 B: mhm 

123.80 126.03 B: i don't know what do you have to say about that 

125.33 127.85 A: [noise] well i personally think um 

128.47 130.49 A: i think sort of 

130.75 133.80 A: making a a humor about certain groups 

133.76 147.12 A: i think can be in bad taste especially if you're if you're talking to a mixed crowd you know what i mean like ah um you know different race or or whatever i think that could be in in bad taste um 

147.66 155.82 A: and then i i think too i think there needs to be a i mean if you know that you're going to go see a comedian that um does a lot of 

156.00 167.69 A: lets say what pornographic [laughter] pornographic stuff um that's one thing that you go someplace where you think it's going to be clean fun and stuff like that comes out i think that's in bad taste [noise] 

166.52 174.67 B: oh yeah a lot of pointless you know [noise] blue language yeah i find that offensive as and it's not funny 

168.10 169.24 A: yeah 

170.02 170.98 A: yeah 

171.06 171.80 A: yeah 

173.91 174.72 A: right 

175.12 189.04 A: right and it just makes it uncomfortable i think too especially if if the rest of the room doesn't think it's funny either um so i don't think i would want to be a standup comedian i think there's too many things that you have to be politically correct for [noise] 

187.94 191.21 B: oh yeah it's only the person that you're with if they don't think it's funny then 

191.07 195.02 A: right and then you have to think well what do they think of me if i think it's funny 

194.14 202.63 B: [laughter] that's right if you laugh and don't say anything yeah it's best to avoid that haven't been in that situation yet that i can remember si- 

195.04 197.74 A: yeah which makes it hard 

198.58 200.26 A: yeah 

201.89 213.93 A: i don't think i have well i don't know i think we've watched like the comedy channel at home and my and you know i mean i've been married for twelve years so i know that my husband finds humor in some things that i just think are stupid you know 

213.04 215.29 B: [laughter] oh yeah like the 

214.00 216.97 A: but [laughter] but that's fine [laughter] 

215.39 221.96 B: sure like the man's show i mean i can't help but laugh at some of the stuff they do there even though i know i shouldn't [laughter] 

218.18 228.99 A: right right well i know i'll probably laugh at something that he like would never understand if it's a women thing you know [noise] but um i think that doesn't i don't think that ah 

225.84 226.81 B: oh yeah 

229.03 231.85 A: i don't think that's the issue about i- in bad taste [noise] 

232.41 233.39 A: um 

234.44 238.58 A: have you ever gone have you ever been in an experience where where either 

239.07 243.65 A: even like at a party if somebody was talking about something if there if a line was drawn 

244.15 245.58 B: (( well i )) 

245.71 247.64 B: i perform on stage 

247.47 248.34 A: (( oh you do )) 

247.69 255.48 B: a lot yes so f- like er for instance i can remember one time and ah are you an nascar fan 

248.91 250.09 A: (( awesome )) 

255.25 256.10 A: uh-huh 

255.85 261.66 B: well i'm not but i i was in anderson south carolina which is like nascar 

261.41 262.32 A: yeah 

262.10 265.55 B: central all down there so when dale ernhart died 

262.91 264.40 A: (( yeah )) 

265.94 275.83 B: ah it was i think more as a reaction to elton john you know perverting candle in the wind every time dies so i wrote my own version to dale ernhart and 

272.49 273.73 A: (( right )) 

276.10 284.75 B: i started playing on the stage that night then the the drummer went over and cut off my mike [laughter] which is yeah because he says man you trying to get us killed 

281.03 282.66 A: oh my gosh 

284.15 287.57 A: oh my gosh so are you in band 

285.27 286.85 B: and i thought well 

287.31 290.64 B: ah i was at the time i'm not doing anything right now 

288.99 290.07 A: oh that's cool 

290.29 291.66 A: oh that's cool though 

291.45 300.93 B: so i guess i've been as much a perpetrator of it as anybody but i i knew most people in the room and i figured they were hip enough to pick up that i that 

295.41 296.40 A: yeah 

299.74 301.82 A: yeah 

301.13 305.89 B: i was commenting more on elton john than i was dale ernhart but but 

303.90 305.12 A: right 

305.24 309.49 A: but it's the situation probably if you hadn't been where you were 

306.78 308.37 B: yeah except that 

309.13 310.36 B: mhm 

309.75 311.16 A: it would have been fine 

311.44 321.67 A: but because of where you were it was taken the wrong way probably if you had been you know any place else or unless you were with a bunch of elton john fans [laughter] you know i think it has 

318.93 331.22 B: [mn] but you seen unfor- unfortunately now that yeah it wouldn't go over now because ah well there again you know time works works against that type of thing because it's not topical any more so that song wouldn't be funny now 

328.91 329.73 A: right 

331.35 333.95 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

334.15 339.98 A: um so is this the first time you've ever well we have to stay on the topic don't we [laughter] ah 

340.78 343.08 B: (( yeah it has to be on the question )) 

343.21 344.80 A: oh yeah 

343.78 346.85 B: mhm how long is this supposed to go on 

346.55 347.73 A: ten minutes 

347.28 348.11 B: okay 

348.50 349.54 A: (( um i'm )) 

351.36 352.64 A: trying to think 

355.08 368.99 A: like when my husband and i went to los vegas okay this is a good example my husband and i went to los vegas and i went to i took him to see um licarsho foe which i don't know if you know it's all male impersonators huh 

366.06 367.72 B: oh i yeah i've seen the movie 

367.97 369.59 B: (( yeah i've seen the movie )) 

369.07 381.87 A: yeah well my husband didn't know that and i know that i had said it to him before i went and of course i was cracking up because they just they're hilarious um and my husband was actually cracking up too and but once he found out that they were 

381.91 382.82 A: men 

383.23 387.64 A: he was very uncomfortable and he didn't think it was funny at all [laughter] 

386.02 392.38 B: no i notice they're gays when they're on stage they i mean there's like nothing off limits and you can [mn] 

388.43 389.90 A: right 

391.92 392.70 A: right 

393.08 397.88 A: and it was like you know i told him that's what we were going to go see but i think why he got uncomfortable was because um 

398.20 399.72 A: (( i think that ah )) 

400.00 412.30 A: um maybe you know they were coming and sitting on his lap and and you know he was laughing and everything and after they left i was like you realize that's a man don't you [laughter] and he was like ew [laughter] so 

411.95 415.95 B: oh yeah i've been to drag shows and they can they can get away with anything 

414.62 422.86 A: oh i know it's hilarious and a- again if you're there and you know what it is then for me it's not bad taste you know what i mean 

416.67 417.63 B: my big 

422.47 433.51 B: and see they could s- they could say almost anything like ah like in reference to elizabeth small or make a redneck joke or whatever and say then if you were to call them down on it then you'd be seen as 

422.97 423.65 A: (( ah )) 

428.23 429.36 A: (( [mn] right )) 

434.26 437.76 B: as being prejudiced against you know being homophobic 

435.54 437.38 A: right right 

437.45 445.05 A: yeah that's true no i have seen i've seen some cross the line that i even felt for them was in bad taste um 

445.11 449.62 A: when it's but i mean then again it might just be because i'm not 

449.73 453.95 A: you know i'm not gay so therefore i found offense to it but i don't know 

454.18 454.94 A: but 

456.10 456.91 A: um 

457.41 464.80 B: yeah it's tough for a a straight white [laughter] to get away with anything or a straight white american i should say 

460.25 461.48 A: yeah right 

462.11 464.10 A: (( yeah )) 

464.59 472.03 A: yeah well i even think it's in poor taste sometimes too like when ah african american comedians are up there and they're [noise] 

472.28 477.09 A: you know making fun of afr- the african american culture i think that's in bad taste 

477.45 478.45 A: i don't 

478.54 483.44 B: oh yeah i don't like how ah it's so easy now you know to joke about the french which 

478.85 480.09 A: (( know [noise] )) 

482.92 483.73 A: right 

483.58 485.49 B: i find that slightly offensive 

485.16 486.32 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

486.25 498.26 B: and of course i i'm still waiting for eastern indians to take up arms i i think because they're still trying to indoctrinate themselves into this country you know they're trying you don't see them out with placards 

493.01 494.25 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

498.04 499.04 A: right 

498.75 504.57 B: like you would even american indians you know now you can't say anything about them anymore it's like east- 

499.98 502.38 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

503.72 504.70 A: right 

504.64 505.56 B: eastern 

504.71 514.65 A: well that's like just like the american indians wanting to go after the redskins football team because they i mean like it's [sigh] so so i think it it can get out of hand 

508.69 510.37 B: sure and the braves 

513.79 516.35 B: oh sure i'm because i you know 

516.53 520.40 B: and here with the atlanta braves i mean there was a gigantic 

518.66 523.55 A: [noise] right yeah [noise] yeah yeah it's ridiculous 

520.60 522.95 B: ha ha over that yeah 

523.66 526.57 A: it's ridiculous [noise] but i guess i've never been 

527.08 528.60 A: i i mean i guess if 

528.97 541.70 A: i don't know i've never seen i'm i'm partly italian um sicilian actually so you know sometimes when they you know you get the stereotypical every italian is a godfather that gets on my nerves sometimes too but 

541.71 542.63 A: i don't know 

543.43 547.47 B: oh yeah of course you've got people protesting shows like the sopranos too 

546.89 548.29 A: (( [noise] [laughter] [noise] yeah )) 

548.38 552.39 A: well and i i mean you even have italians protesting sopranos because 

552.42 558.25 A: that's not the norm and i think that when people watch the t- watch t._v. um 

558.43 561.73 A: they feel that that is the norm you know [noise] 

560.23 566.67 B: but ah anybody that actually lives in the outside world beyond a t._v. surely can tell that it's [laughter] 

565.18 566.07 A: right 

566.23 567.14 A: right 

567.22 569.37 B: you know it's just a lampoon it's 

567.48 573.02 A: right yeah well no that was like the whole thing you know with everybody you know with um 

573.84 575.45 A: with everybody um 

576.17 577.86 A: (( whatchamacallit um )) 

578.55 580.04 A: just lost my train of thought 

580.19 582.30 A: with everybody um 

583.79 587.09 A: thinking that all italians were part of the mafia you know 

587.12 592.20 A: when the godfather came out people were up in up in arms about that because everybody [noise] 

590.54 592.22 B: [mn] oh yeah i remember 

592.42 597.72 A: everybody was like it puts a bad bad name to the mafia [laughter] 

597.80 599.60 A: i mean i mean to the italians
