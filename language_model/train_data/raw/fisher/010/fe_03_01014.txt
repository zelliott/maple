84.07 84.98 B: um 

85.37 91.98 B: at least you know from how the media presented it was very um i i was impressed with the way they responded when

306.13 319.15 A: so we've noticed a slowdown here as in all kinds of people have stopped spending money at first friv frivolous things like painting you know home improvement and stuff like that and i think it is a direct affect of you know 

311.43 312.47 B: mhm 

314.06 316.56 B: [laughter] right 

319.29 323.83 A: of the terrorist and the threat that's always hanging over us like 

323.11 323.98 B: mhm 

323.89 326.31 A: (( you know what's going to happen stuff like that )) 

325.97 326.85 B: right 

328.59 329.37 B: yeah 

329.61 330.51 B: um 

330.82 333.04 B: the threat of war of course is another 

333.33 339.62 B: um that's what that's what worries me really more than you know a particular terrorist attack here 

338.96 340.88 A: yep me too 

342.21 343.30 B: but um 

345.15 346.02 B: (( i don't know )) 

346.20 349.92 B: i don't i think a lot of people don't feel like there's anything 

350.17 353.55 B: you know they individually about can can do about it 

353.61 354.57 A: right 

355.74 357.45 A: yeah i mean 

358.47 359.67 A: that's what 

359.85 364.05 A: you know when they issue the yellow days and the red days and you know the different 

364.46 367.23 A: designations for the terrorist threat 

368.14 371.06 A: i don't see how that affects anybody 

371.01 371.85 B: right 

372.37 381.60 B: well what are we supposed to do exactly [laughter] i think that unless you're in law enforcement or or you know if you worked at a hospital there'll be certain things i guess you might you know 

381.38 382.32 A: right 

381.58 391.31 B: turn up a notch or something but as far as just you know just everyday people i'm not sure they haven't really told us exactly what we're supposed to do on these days you know [laughter] 

390.83 392.65 A: mhm 

391.44 393.28 B: like they did come out with a 

393.38 396.92 B: resource to be plastic sheeting or some- you know [laughter] and a few 

396.86 411.24 B: some things like that and then the next day we heard that no that wouldn't do any good anyway you know like as far as the bio-terrorism thing by the time we knew about it it'd be too late that you know putting up plastic sheeting would just be keeping it in rather than [laughter] you know keeping it out 

402.34 404.23 A: right 

406.50 408.27 A: right 

409.71 412.26 A: [laughter] yeah 

411.35 412.09 B: (( so i )) 

412.24 415.28 B: don't think they've really told us i mean when they make those alerts 

415.35 418.24 B: what it is you know that we can do or 

418.55 431.94 A: well we here in california you know we always have the threat of a big earthquake so we all have or most people have emergency kits where you know plastic sheeting duct tape blankets canned food canned you know water and stuff like that 

422.57 423.48 B: mhm 

425.96 426.83 B: mhm 

431.41 432.27 B: mhm 

432.00 436.67 A: in a big plastic dumpster in the garage a lot of people have that so i think that's 

437.26 440.52 A: basically that's all that we can do as regular citizens 

440.14 440.97 B: right 

441.08 443.38 A: (( you know i don't think there's anything else that we can do )) 

443.25 444.17 B: mhm 

444.60 450.75 A: but ah mhm you know concerned in case you are cut off and we live in kind of a remote area so 

451.44 455.20 A: we would be cut off anyway we've got a weeny generator just to 

455.53 458.75 A: (( you know just to handle the basic necessities but )) 

458.92 460.91 A: (( we haven't done anything past that )) 

460.47 461.32 B: mhm 

462.99 465.58 B: i do you watch the show 'twenty four' 

465.87 467.26 A: (( no uh-uh ooh )) 

466.44 468.99 B: okay [laughter] they just got a 

469.82 475.95 B: the last one there a terrorist got a nuclear bomb into the country and it was in l._a. and 

476.60 478.10 B: [laughter] 

476.63 488.70 A: [laughter] that's what we're afraid of we're trying to take bets as to what you know if there was a bomb from north korea where would it you know where would they aim in southern california san francisco or 

485.64 486.56 B: (( mhm )) 

486.88 487.64 B: (( right )) 

488.70 494.43 A: or l._a. and pretty much the vote is la [laughter] we're all out 

491.76 493.43 B: yeah [laughter] 

494.19 495.16 B: mhm 

495.73 497.76 A: but that that i think 

498.19 505.27 A: is a huge deterrent because north korea said that they would shoot a nuclear missile at us if we attacked iraq 

506.07 508.61 B: they said they would i'm sorry say that again 

508.10 516.85 A: yeah that they would attack us send a nuclear missile to the united states if we attacked iraq i think that should be a bigger threat than 

510.45 511.28 B: (( mhm )) 

513.38 513.97 B: (( oh )) 

514.23 514.92 B: (( i )) 

516.91 518.67 A: saddam hussain anyway 

518.18 519.11 B: right 

520.19 525.34 B: i still you know i never would have connected iraq and north korea [laughter] i do 

525.58 534.10 B: i don't know [laughter] i guess i mean i heard that that north korea says well if we attack iraq they're afraid they're going to be next so i guess 

525.83 527.41 A: no me neither 

533.20 534.10 A: right 

534.86 535.79 B: but um 

535.86 536.94 A: i don't know 

543.70 545.17 B: but yeah in the um 

545.23 553.50 B: in 'twenty four' it looks like in the next episode they're they're you know in just the preview that looks like there's doing a lot of like rioting and everything in 

553.27 555.06 A: [noise] 

553.62 555.00 B: l._a. after 

555.30 556.13 B: the 

556.57 560.05 B: the they the bomb actually went off in the desert um but 

560.41 561.67 A: (( [mn] ooh )) 

560.90 564.42 B: anyway it will be interesting to see how they they handle that it's very you know [laughter] 

565.05 568.16 A: and that show's supposed to be pretty realistic right 

567.67 568.69 B: mhm 

568.90 570.84 B: yeah it is um 

572.46 576.38 B: (( it's a on the edge of your seat kinda show [laughter] ))

583.09 583.87 B: (( [laughter] )) 

584.40 585.43 B: yeah you might 

585.54 592.38 B: maybe too late to catch it this season you might might see it next season we actually started with the you know last of their first the first one 

592.53 595.52 B: we hardly watch any t._v. that's like the only show i actually watch 

595.71 596.59 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

596.16 599.89 B: [laughter] but we somehow got into kinda by chance tuned into
