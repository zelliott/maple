18.77 19.47 A: yeah 

21.98 25.24 A: oh yes would we remain calm or 

26.22 27.43 A: panic during 

27.56 28.79 A: an act of terrorism 

29.04 31.40 B: well how would you feel 

30.79 32.92 A: i know i would panic 

38.22 38.92 A: i know 

39.08 39.84 B: you know 

39.99 40.96 B: uh this is 

41.22 44.41 B: i'm sure it's my husband says it's been around for many years 

44.79 45.73 B: the terrorism 

46.07 46.42 B: but 

46.68 48.48 B: being able to um 

53.78 54.09 A: i've 

57.39 60.18 B: dignitaries and people that all of the sudden miss 

60.33 66.26 B: you know go missing and this and that and now it's terrorism at the worst and uh 

62.13 62.72 A: mhm 

65.72 66.25 A: i know 

66.36 69.74 B: i just think that uh uh it would be 

69.85 70.95 B: for me 

71.28 75.86 B: i would be very upset and worried especially with my children do you have kids 

73.89 74.15 A: (( oh )) 

75.47 82.49 A: ah i have one daughter but she's thirty six and and doesn't live close to home you know so i'd even be more worried 

80.91 81.39 B: yeah 

82.25 91.93 B: let's see i do too i have two sons and they're thirty and they live in texas but not where in not in san antonio and my grand kids i have six grand kids

88.25 88.75 A: yeah 

91.36 96.29 A: well and then they say well you know tape up your house and do this and that and i'm thinking 

96.77 102.43 A: in arizona if we had an act of terrorism in the summer you might as well kiss it goodbye 

102.32 109.32 B: exactly because that's it what wou- how would you c- how would you hold up i mean 

105.34 106.20 A: yeah 

108.49 108.84 A: i 

109.01 112.95 A: i know you couldn't you couldn't live without air and you couldn't be 

113.23 114.15 A: taped up 

114.35 115.17 B: no 

114.64 116.59 A: you know in a house that in a 

116.86 118.98 A: in a room that doesn't get air 

119.22 122.82 B: and i've heard that that doesn't work either my husband said that stuff would not that 

123.10 125.58 B: that duck tape would not be a good thing 

125.12 125.81 A: yeah 

125.70 127.98 B: it won't hold the um 

128.28 129.00 B: they keep that

131.71 133.79 B: whatever they use 

133.18 134.70 A: and don't you think that 

135.19 137.14 A: you know like i i'm trying to think of 

137.29 137.66 A: some 

138.09 141.19 A: how would they get the poison all over the whole 

141.43 142.46 A: y- area 

142.56 143.30 A: i mean you know 

142.62 143.17 B: well those 

143.46 146.95 B: those uh dirty bombs get into the air and 

146.68 147.70 A: oh okay 

147.13 155.34 B: they explode and all this uh the way i was uh told from my husband he wor- he's a was a marine for twenty years 

154.91 157.36 A: oh okay so he does know 

155.90 158.64 B: and so and he worked in intelligence 

158.38 159.24 A: oh okay 

158.74 164.14 B: and then he also uh is now working out lackland here in san antonio as a um 

164.74 167.78 B: uh computer programmer in civil service 

167.50 168.00 A: mhm 

167.91 176.54 B: so he's up on all what's going on out there you know everything t- every time you turn around there's uh uh some type of alert going on at the base 

168.12 168.49 A: okay 

171.14 171.58 A: oh 

175.29 176.60 A: alert or security 

177.45 177.95 A: oh

185.65 186.24 A: mhm 

185.90 189.59 B: in the states i mean they're all around and all they have to do is get 

188.00 188.52 A: yeah 

189.92 200.72 B: get these pieces and put them together and build one of those and they wouldn't have to worry about iraq coming over here and doing it they would already be here to do it so that's what's scary 

197.86 198.48 A: yeah 

198.63 198.90 A: yeah 

199.95 201.43 A: well and i and i think

227.84 228.35 A: yeah 

228.67 229.64 B: and i would be 

229.87 230.40 B: so 

230.89 232.12 B: overwhelmed with 

232.01 237.21 A: oh i would too and i don't that we i don't think anybody really knows how to prepare you 

232.52 233.24 B: wondering 

237.44 238.01 B: no 

237.87 239.23 A: for it because

243.71 247.20 B: now they're talk on the our news last night they had they showed uh 

247.89 251.95 B: uh some tents you can buy that are suppose to be

263.56 265.03 B: be closed in 

265.33 266.71 B: from all this 

266.99 272.77 B: mess that might be in the air but but then again there you are you know how long will that last 

267.20 267.95 A: the air 

268.87 269.29 A: mhm 

272.82 273.56 A: that's right 

272.98 278.92 B: and then in your situation and we're the same way in the summer time well when our summer starts right around april 

279.04 282.77 B: we we get hot too and very humid 

281.07 287.21 A: yes well we do too you know we're probably going to be we're in the eighty fives today

287.71 288.29 A: yeah 

288.20 290.75 B: and uh we've been having a lot of rain so

291.84 292.22 A: yeah 

292.70 295.14 B: if you eh have to worry with that type of 

295.24 300.43 B: temperatures you know with the humidity and we have the humidity you're you're drier aren't you

302.78 303.18 A: yeah 

303.21 304.64 B: very hot 

304.75 308.19 B: so i don't know i don't think it would be a good thing uh for 

307.38 308.92 A: no i don't think so 

308.57 314.74 B: anyway if it's winter fall spring or summer i don't think it's good at all 

312.97 319.17 A: it's going to be good because i mean and then plus that i mean it's like how long do you have to be in the little tents 

319.22 320.06 B: yeah 

319.82 321.93 A: or in your little room and 

321.34 321.99 B: and have

322.56 323.16 A: and you know 

323.28 324.41 A: and what do you do what about 

323.34 334.21 B: and how long would your water going to hold out and all those necessary things you that you think about that you know if things were going to happen and how many people actually really do all of that you know

344.72 345.51 B: yea 

345.21 345.73 A: you know 

346.35 350.13 A: but i i certainly couldn't live for thirty days

352.69 354.91 A: you know in a closed up room 

354.80 356.30 B: no i wouldn't want to be in a

357.98 358.51 A: no 

360.30 361.09 A: yeah 

361.23 363.36 A: what are you going to do and then also what 

363.96 370.12 A: one of the things they said was well have an evacuation plan and make sure that your family knows where you're going well 

368.73 369.54 B: oh yeah 

370.84 375.71 A: i don't know where to go and then plus that there's a million people millions of people in phoenix 

375.76 377.06 B: oh yes 

376.10 378.96 A: we would all be on the same road going out 

378.66 382.26 B: exactly exactly and that's the same way it is here with 

380.71 381.44 A: you know 

382.53 385.39 B: san antonio it's have you ever been to san antonio 

383.66 384.33 A: yeah

386.48 388.85 B: oh well you need to come it's nice but 

388.35 391.65 A: i know i heard that little waterway or walkway 

391.00 399.83 B: now the red river walk and uh now that would be a place for them to hit that terrorists could hit that river walk and uh that would be 

392.45 393.90 A: yeah that's it 

395.74 396.54 A: yeah 

400.07 401.49 B: terrible that w- because there's 

402.04 410.17 B: oh i don't know how many people a day go to the river walk but it it's a tourist deal and therefore you would have 

405.35 406.41 A: oh no 

407.69 408.12 A: yeah 

412.48 414.27 A: mhm up and down that area 

419.25 426.72 B: go down to the river walk all day long and there's restaurants and everything to eat from and and it's a playground and it's 

426.87 431.86 B: it's everything i mean it's for kids and adults and everything but anyway um 

427.97 429.66 A: oh that's terrible 

430.59 431.28 A: well and i 

431.42 433.16 A: i worry about the nuclear plants 

433.32 433.70 A: too 

433.71 434.74 B: oh yes 

433.82 434.10 A: that's 

434.39 439.12 A: you know and we do have one uh it's on the other side of phoenix i'm on the one side of phoenix 

439.95 442.16 A: it's on the other thank goodness but 

442.41 445.82 A: you know they had an article in the paper today about you know that 

446.00 448.55 A: you know what would the neighborhood do and 

448.77 449.55 B: mhm 

449.14 453.57 A: you know but i guess they've got an evacuation plan and they were saying that they have a very good 

454.06 455.66 A: plan they've been working on 

455.86 458.01 A: terrorism and everything (( further that's uh )) 

458.11 458.87 A: planned but 

459.41 465.17 A: that really bothers me too i'm thinking oh brother you know what would a nuclear attack do 

462.72 463.33 B: uh-huh 

464.71 472.06 B: well nuclear we'll just have to all forget it because eventually you know your water and your and your 

467.40 468.74 A: yeah i mean you know 

469.32 469.91 A: yeah 

471.19 473.18 A: yeah everything and so 

477.23 477.81 A: mhm 

482.39 483.04 A: yeah 

486.95 492.89 B: frightening and you keep thinking when you walk out of the movie but maybe that will never happen you know 

491.67 493.81 A: well i hope and pray because you know 

494.30 496.35 A: i wouldn't put anything past them that's 

496.16 496.83 B: um um 

496.47 499.83 A: the problem is that they just hate us so much 

497.08 497.68 B: um um 

499.36 501.15 B: oh yes and uh and be 

500.30 505.44 A: and i never re- i never really realized that until nine eleven and then it was like oh my god 

503.96 504.74 B: oh yeah 

508.31 508.94 A: yeah 

513.04 515.91 B: you have someone that wants to be very powerful and 

516.17 519.41 B: more powerful than we are and that it's a fight for 

524.52 525.73 A: mhm yeah 

530.74 532.66 B: and never have to worry about terrorism and 

533.24 535.98 B: and if you walk out your door what's going to happen but 

536.25 541.95 B: no this is a crazy world we live in now and it's getting more and more so
