16.47 17.50 A: (( um )) 

18.59 32.59 A: first of all if if humor um is offensive like hurting someone's feelings um i definitely draw the line there you know if it's attacking someone we we um do kid each other in our home but if it gets 

33.79 42.58 A: [sigh] too bad then [laughter] then you know we draw the line hey that's you know that was a low blow but a lot of times i i- it's fun you know because you 

42.60 45.11 A: um maybe bring out 

45.50 51.60 A: ah er the you know my kids are always teasing me i'm forty seven so of course i'm ancient to my you know to my

62.09 74.75 B: it's it's it's it's better to laugh than than to feel sorry for yourself in order to agree you know don't agree just you know it's and and i think i think humor right now has just really gotten 

64.26 65.31 A: (( it is )) 

65.87 66.96 A: (( that's true )) 

68.36 69.67 A: absolutely 

74.76 76.26 B: a little bit 

76.19 83.23 B: weird to me because it's it's it's a lot i mean different to when i was younger i'm like thirty six i'm thirty seven right now 

82.28 83.39 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

83.07 96.49 B: and and it me it's like kids find the weirdest things funnier now that i things that i i would think offensive now so but of course then i think well maybe when i was that age i thought the same thing so i didn't didn't really think about it but 

95.12 101.68 A: mm mm i think i think that the media has a lot to do with that i mean i look at um at- [sigh] 

101.83 104.68 A: at some of those shows that kids watch 

104.25 105.47 B: oh yeah

107.42 108.47 A: awful 

108.59 109.87 A: you know even 

110.73 122.04 A: [sigh] i don't know my children were never allowed to watch m._t._v. but i i think that you know i've seen excerpts from it and and i it's degrading i mean you know 

117.35 118.79 B: mhm 

120.46 121.66 B: oh i know well 

121.67 134.68 B: you can look at what what's on t._v. nowadays i mean joe millionaire or or marry america's marrying you off to somebody i mean that's like kinda lo- [noise] value of of 

126.32 127.32 A: right 

130.33 130.97 A: mhm 

134.89 141.02 B: so it's it's kinda it's to me it's like it's putting off the wrong message of

429.98 437.69 A: oh i've heard that i've heard that saying you know the three stooges are well you know i don't think the kids really took that seriously 

437.29 438.63 B: no no 

437.74 442.21 A: um and and yet then they come out with cartoons that are supposed to be funny now 

442.13 447.24 A: and they are very disrespectful to one another and to adults 

447.14 458.98 A: and and i find that humor like you were saying you know offensive i find that very offensive and then when kids are disrespectful to one another or to adults to their teachers
