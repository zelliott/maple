zzso the ways in which socioeconomic status zzso affects mortality is important for defining strategies to eliminate the unequal burden of cancer by race and ethnicity in the United zzso 

Disease stage, treatment, and zzso mortality rates were zzso by reviewing medical records, and zzso was determined by analyzing income and education at the census tract level for zzso women with breast cancer, zzso men with prostate cancer, and zzso men and women with zzso cancer who were diagnosed in 7 zzso states in zzso 

Low zzso was associated with more advanced disease stage and with less aggressive treatment for all 3 zzso The hazard ratio zzso for zzso zzso mortality associated with low zzso was elevated after a diagnosis of breast cancer when the analysis was adjusted for age zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso Adjustment for zzso factors of zzso zzso conditions, cancer stage, and treatment reduced the zzso The zzso mortality risk associated with low zzso was elevated after a diagnosis of prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso adjustments for zzso factors also reduced that zzso There was less association between zzso and mortality after a diagnosis of zzso zzso For all 3 cancer sites, low zzso was a much stronger predictor of mortality among individuals aged zzso years and among individuals from zzso minority zzso 

The current results indicated that low zzso is a risk factor for zzso mortality after a diagnosis of cancer, largely because of a later stage at diagnosis and less aggressive zzso These findings support the need to focus on zzso as an underlying factor in cancer disparities by race and zzso
