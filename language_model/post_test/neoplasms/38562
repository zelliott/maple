zzso shock and invasive infection are diseases caused by zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso The search for and identification of these factors has led to the discovery and molecular cloning of zzso This zzso zzso is identical to tumor necrosis factor zzso and, when released into the zzso causes profound shock and multiple organ zzso zzso zzso protect against the lethal effects of mice given zzso and zzso given zzso coli, a result suggesting that this zzso is both necessary and sufficient to provoke septic zzso zzso is produced in humans after zzso zzso the infusion of small doses of zzso is associated with fever, zzso headache, and zzso zzso patients also produce zzso and during zzso infection, patients with the highest serum levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso production causes a potentially lethal syndrome of zzso zzso and protein and zzso zzso Future investigation is being directed toward the development of zzso zzso for use in treating the zzso zzso systemic complications of infectious zzso
