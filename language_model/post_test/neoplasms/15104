G zzso zzso zzso are being used as zzso zzso for in zzso zzso and therapy of zzso Recently, zzso zzso were shown to be superior to zzso Here, we compare the new zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso for targeting the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso values, and zzso potency were determined using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and imaging studies were done in nude mice transplanted with the zzso zzso The zzso potency was assessed by evaluating the effects on calcium release and on zzso zzso monitored by zzso zzso 

The zzso value of zzso was 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to bind to the zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso A higher maximum number of binding site value was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso in the zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is inactive alone but efficiently zzso the zzso zzso These data are confirmed by the calcium release zzso The zzso showed a superiority of the zzso with regard to the high tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso at 4 hours after zzso as well as to all zzso tissue zzso 

Despite their relatively low zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed superior targeting properties compared with zzso As found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seem to be superior to zzso for in zzso imaging and potentially also for targeted zzso of zzso zzso
