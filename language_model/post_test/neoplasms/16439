Workers in the diesel fuel distribution trade are zzso exposed to fuel zzso zzso fuel presents the main source of air pollution by zzso at a marine diesel fuel zzso zzso of zzso are used to evaluate the external exposure to diesel zzso Since zzso causes zzso in zzso zzso and some of these may lead to the generation of zzso zzso synthesis is proposed as a zzso of early health effects of diesel zzso A group of 20 workers exposed to diesel fuel and a group of 20 zzso persons were examined and interviewed using structured zzso The levels of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso as well as levels of zzso associated with DNA were determined in zzso zzso zzso of the metals zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured in blood plasma by flame atomic zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso levels were significantly increased in marine terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 77 zzso zzso in exposed and control individuals, zzso zzso activity was zzso fold higher in zzso of workers exposed to diesel fuels zzso zzso zzso At the same time zzso activity was decreased and zzso level was accordingly zzso The amount of zzso associated with DNA increased zzso fold in exposed workers zzso zzso zzso Among all investigated metals in blood plasma of exposed workers only zinc levels were statistically significantly increased zzso zzso zzso The disturbances of zzso metabolism in zzso and zinc level in blood plasma caused by diesel fuel exposure seems to be a useful zzso for zzso risk zzso
