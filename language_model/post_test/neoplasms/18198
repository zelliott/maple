A number of retrospective studies report that patients with zzso have increased morbidity and premature zzso with standardized mortality ratios zzso of zzso Many patients with zzso develop zzso as a result of the zzso zzso itself or therapies such as surgery and zzso zzso zzso and zzso have also been associated with an increased zzso 

Using the West zzso zzso database zzso zzso zzso 275 zzso we assessed the influence of prior zzso and zzso (and replacement zzso on mortality in patients with zzso Median duration of follow-up was zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso 

zzso mortality was elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso On external analysis, prior zzso zzso and zzso zzso were associated with an elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso On internal analysis, the relative risk zzso of mortality was increased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not in the zzso or zzso zzso In the zzso group, increased replacement doses of zzso greater than 25 zzso were associated with increased mortality compared to lower zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso are significantly associated with increased mortality in patients with zzso In zzso patients, a daily dose of more than 25 zzso zzso is associated with increased mortality compared to lower zzso These results have important implications for the treatment of patients with zzso and also raise issues as to the optimum zzso treatment regimens for zzso zzso
