zzso regulatory T cells comprise zzso of zzso T cells in zzso mice and have been shown in several in zzso zzso models to prevent the induction of zzso disease and inflammatory zzso Since T cells, which mediate zzso can through recognition of zzso also target zzso cells, it was zzso that zzso regulatory cells would also inhibit the generation of immune responses to zzso zzso of these cells using zzso zzso zzso has indeed been shown to promote rejection of several zzso zzso zzso cell lines including melanoma, zzso and zzso zzso zzso obtained using these models indicate that in the absence of regulatory cells, zzso T cells mediate zzso zzso although the precise mechanisms through which these cells result in zzso rejection have not yet been zzso The target zzso recognized by these zzso T cells have also not yet been zzso zzso of mice with zzso cells in the absence of zzso regulatory cells does, however, induce immunity against a variety of different zzso cell lines indicating that the target zzso are shared amongst zzso of distinct zzso zzso Since zzso regulatory cells have been identified in humans, the possibility that the cells inhibit immune responses to shared rejection zzso expressed by human zzso is worthy of zzso
