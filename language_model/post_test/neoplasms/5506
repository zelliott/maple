A fundamental obstacle in gene therapy for cancer treatment is the specific delivery of an zzso gene product to a solid zzso Although several strategies exist to control gene expression once a zzso is directly introduced into a zzso as yet no systemic delivery system exists that specifically targets solid zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso have been used zzso as zzso agents because of their selective growth in the hypoxic regions of solid tumors after systemic zzso In this report we further describe a novel approach to cancer gene therapy in which genetically engineered zzso are used as zzso zzso for the delivery of zzso zzso We have introduced into a strain of zzso zzso the gene for an zzso coli zzso known to activate the nontoxic zzso CB 1954 to a toxic zzso zzso zzso produced by these zzso enhanced the killing of tumor cells in zzso by CB zzso by a factor of zzso To demonstrate the specificity of this approach for tumor zzso we zzso injected the inactive spore form of zzso zzso which upon transition to a zzso state will express the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso in 10 of 10 tumors during the first 5 days after intravenous injection of inactive zzso spores, indicating a rapid transition from spore to zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso spores which did not possess the zzso coli zzso gene were devoid of zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso coli zzso protein was not found in a large survey of normal mouse zzso following intravenous injection of zzso containing zzso strongly suggesting that zzso zzso bacteria such as zzso can be zzso as highly specific gene delivery zzso for cancer zzso
