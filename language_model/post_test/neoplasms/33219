Human zzso is a zzso process in which zzso cells progress through a series of zzso zzso until an invasive cancer zzso zzso experimental observations in zzso have demonstrated this process can be divided into three general zzso zzso promotion, and zzso However, this zzso zzso zzso explanation of zzso has not been zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso changes zzso in evolutionary zzso such as the zzso zzso Here, we analyze an evolutionary model of cellular dynamics that defines mutual interactions of cellular and zzso events and tissue level changes in tumor growth and zzso zzso are expressed using an zzso landscape that illustrates the evolutionary potential of cells that allow them to adapt to specific zzso selection zzso It is shown that normal zzso cells have a novel zzso landscape that permits coexistence of normal cellular populations but also allows invasion by zzso zzso zzso cancer evolution is possible due to a relaxation of tissue growth constraints (as zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and adaptations in response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to separation of evolving tumor cells from their blood supply by an intact basement zzso zzso based on the dynamic model, produce three distinct stages of zzso that are consistent with the zzso promotion, and progression stages observed zzso The simulations provide insight into the underlying cellular and zzso dynamics that govern these empirical observations and suggest novel prevention strategies that may be tested zzso
