Two synthetic peptides from the predicted sequence of the human zzso protein were zzso and used to raise zzso in zzso The sequences chosen were identical to those in the zzso rat zzso zzso The zzso produced reacted with the zzso peptides in zzso but showed little or no zzso with the partly zzso peptides found in equivalent positions in the human zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso specific for the rat zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein from zzso zzso prepared from a rat cell line known to express high levels of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso also recognized a protein of the same size in Western zzso In addition, both zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein from zzso cell zzso prepared from human and monkey zzso zzso to one of the zzso which showed no zzso zzso with human, rat or monkey zzso zzso were used to examine the expression of the zzso protein on a variety of cultured cell zzso Eleven transformed, I zzso and 2 immortalized cell types were examined by zzso for their level of expression of the zzso protein and of the zzso zzso The numbers of zzso receptors varied widely between different cell lines, whereas the level of the zzso zzso which was found on all of the cell types zzso was more zzso The number of zzso molecules present was estimated by zzso to be about 100,000 per zzso The zzso were then used to examine the location and level of expression of the human zzso and rat zzso proteins in normal zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso protein was highly expressed in rat kidney zzso zzso and loop of zzso The zzso protein was also present on normal human zzso cells but in some cases with a different distribution to that of the zzso zzso
