zzso analysis is often based upon incremental cost per increase in survival zzso Using this definition supportive care measures, which increase quality but not quantity of life, generate a zero zzso and cannot be directly compared with other components of health care zzso zzso analysis, which measures incremental cost per increase in zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso utility score zzso time at risk, addresses this problem, since successful supportive intervention increases the utility score and thus provides a finite zzso in zzso even when absolute survival is zzso However, utility scores for various supportive care zzso have not been well zzso As a pilot study to generate a first approximation of a utility score for zzso we used a rating scale technique and administered two visual analogue scale questions to 30 patients completing a cycle of zzso Patients rated their global quality of life during their previous cycle of chemotherapy with hypothetical absence or presence of zzso as the only zzso The study population included 8 male and 22 female patients, with a median age of 56 zzso The most common zzso were breast cancer (8 zzso lung cancer (7 zzso and zzso zzso (7 zzso On a 100 zzso visual analogue scale, the mean score for overall quality of life during chemotherapy was 79 zzso without zzso and 27 zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso paired zzso The implied marked increase in utility with relief of zzso suggests a significant impact on zzso zzso Similar methodology could be used to estimate utility scores in other areas of supportive zzso
