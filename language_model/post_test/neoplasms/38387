The events occurring during tumor formation and progression display similarities to some of the steps in embryonic zzso The family of zzso proteins consists of five different zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that play relevant roles in embryonic development, as demonstrated by the zzso of the corresponding knockout zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso proteins play an essential role in zzso zzso of zzso expression in tumor cells by zzso interference zzso led to enhanced tumor growth and reduced zzso cell death, as well as migration and zzso Most of these biological zzso were rescued by zzso zzso We observed that increased zzso growth was mostly due to highly enhanced proliferation of the tumor cells together with reduced innate immune cell zzso Moreover, we showed that migration impairment was zzso at least in part, by zzso zzso To identify the genetic programs involved in zzso we performed whole zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso cells and observed that zzso regulates specific genes involved in cell cycle, cell death, zzso and zzso In particular, we showed that zzso zzso and zzso play a major role in zzso controlled migration, as zzso of any of these genes severely altered zzso
