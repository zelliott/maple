Almost any type of zzso treatment including chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and targeted drugs can induce host molecular and cellular zzso effects which, in turn, can lead to tumor outgrowth and zzso despite an initial successful therapy zzso zzso zzso due to host zzso effects is attributed to zzso tumor cell dissemination from the primary tumors and seeding at zzso zzso This short review will describe the types of host cells that participate in this process, the types of factors zzso from the host following therapy that can promote tumor zzso and the possible implications of this unique and yet only zzso zzso It is zzso that blocking these specific zzso effects in the zzso host in response to cancer therapy may aid in identifying new zzso targets for cancer, which in combination with conventional treatments can prolong therapy efficacy and extend zzso Additional studies investigating this specific research zzso in zzso models and in the clinical setting are essential in order to advance our understanding of how tumors zzso and evade zzso
