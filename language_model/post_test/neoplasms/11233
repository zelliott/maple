A growing body of experimental evidence supports the view that certain human zzso fragile sites have roles to play in zzso The principle lines of evidence are at the level of zzso mechanism and gene zzso Most research in this area has previously zzso on the zzso common fragile site and the zzso gene that spans this zzso Here we review recent progress in zzso the second most readily observed common fragile site, zzso and the zzso gene that spans zzso Comparative analyses of zzso and zzso reveal some striking similarities suggesting that these sites and their associated genes may play a part in a normal protective response of cells to environmental zzso
