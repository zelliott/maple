In the current study, we assessed the global DNA zzso changes in human zzso zzso cells in zzso in response to 5 direct and 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to the selected agents for 24 h in the presence and/or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for quantitative profiling of zzso The effect of exposure on zzso between control and exposed cultures was assessed by applying the marginal model with correlated zzso on % global DNA zzso zzso We reported the induction of global DNA zzso in zzso cells in response to zzso zzso mix, under the current experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso carbon zzso and zzso induced global DNA zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that dose did not have an effect on global DNA zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion we report changes in global DNA zzso as an early event in response to agents traditionally considered as zzso
