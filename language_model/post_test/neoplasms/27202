zzso zzso instability and copy number zzso are hallmarks of zzso zzso capable of promoting zzso copy number changes have yet to be zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to localized copy gain of zzso zzso and zzso without global zzso zzso zzso tumors have increased copy gains for these same zzso zzso copy gain occurs within a single cell cycle, requires S phase, and is not stable but is zzso each cell zzso Sites with increased copy number are zzso and have increased zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suppresses the copy gain, whereas zzso zzso interference promotes zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of a zzso modifier results in zzso copy zzso This begins to establish how copy number changes could originate during zzso and demonstrates that transient zzso of specific zzso zzso could promote these zzso
