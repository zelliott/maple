zzso is a key DNA mismatch repair zzso protein involved in maintaining zzso stability by participating in the repair of zzso and zzso zzso in the daughter strands during S zzso zzso zzso can result following treatment with several classes of zzso drugs, as well as with zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the role of the zzso protein in determining the cellular and molecular responses to prolonged zzso rate zzso radiation zzso which is similar to the clinical use of cancer zzso 

An zzso pair of zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso cancer zzso cells was exposed to prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso survival and gene zzso rates were zzso Cell cycle distribution was analyzed with flow zzso Changes in selected DNA damage repair zzso DNA damage response zzso and cell death marker proteins were examined with Western zzso 

zzso zzso cells showed greater zzso with enhanced expression of zzso and zzso zzso a reduced zzso gene zzso rate, and more pronounced cell cycle zzso zzso zzso population and a zzso zzso following zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso a progressive increase in zzso protein levels was found in zzso cells during prolonged zzso which was temporally correlated with a progressive decrease in zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso status significantly affects cellular responses to prolonged zzso zzso may enhance cell zzso to prolonged zzso through zzso of zzso zzso (through zzso of zzso
