Natural killer zzso cells, like B and T zzso are potent zzso cells that are crucial for immunity to tumors and zzso These zzso responses must be controlled to avoid zzso attack against normal zzso Yet, the mechanisms that guide zzso cell tolerance differ from those guiding T and B cell zzso Here, we discuss how zzso cells are licensed by zzso class I molecules through their zzso receptors which results in zzso cell functional competence to be triggered through their zzso zzso We discuss recent data with respect to issues related to licensing, thereby providing a framework for unifying concepts on zzso cell zzso
