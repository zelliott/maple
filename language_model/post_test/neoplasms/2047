The possibilities of zzso are discussed from the engineering technology zzso zzso equipment yields powerful effects against a superficial zzso zzso zzso method and zzso phased array system zzso are typical heating methods against a zzso zzso We have proposed that in the zzso zzso method the diameter of the zzso zzso should be more than zzso times the distance between two zzso In zzso another exciting method zzso zzso has been zzso Electric current flows through the short axis of the body by the TE mode zzso We are developing zzso resonant cavity zzso which have the characteristics to heat zzso regions of small zzso We can install an zzso tube inside the zzso zzso This method is suitable for deep and concentrated zzso We conclude that the recent rapid development of various kinds of zzso apparatus makes it possible to heat more safely and effectively the zzso regions of the human zzso
