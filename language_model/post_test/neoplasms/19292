The regulatory zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso exists in the zzso zzso and zzso which distinguish zzso zzso type I zzso and type II zzso Evidence obtained from different experimental zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso shown that zzso and zzso are expressed in a balance of cell growth and zzso Loss of this balance may zzso cancer genesis and zzso DNA zzso demonstrate that zzso suppression of the zzso which zzso zzso zzso a wide range of genes involved in cell proliferation and transformation while zzso cell differentiation and reverse transformation genes in zzso prostate tumors that undergo zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso as opposed to those of zzso and zzso exhibits induction of differentiation genes along with suppression of cell proliferation and transformation genes leading to zzso of tumor zzso Thus, switching of zzso zzso can cause tumor cells to undergo zzso zzso of the zzso
