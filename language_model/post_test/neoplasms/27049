zzso are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric cancer zzso The aim of this study was to establish the zzso spectrum and the zzso patterns of zzso bacteria in pediatric cancer patients with zzso zzso in relation to the use of zzso and empirical zzso 

We analyzed positive blood cultures of pediatric cancer patients presenting with zzso zzso between 2004 and 2011 in zzso and Amsterdam (the zzso and in zzso zzso using different zzso zzso and empirical zzso 

A total of 156 patients with 202 zzso due to 248 bacteria species, were zzso The majority zzso of zzso were caused by zzso zzso zzso bacteria, especially zzso zzso were observed significantly more often in zzso where no zzso prophylaxis was zzso zzso bacteria were cultured more often from patients who did receive zzso zzso compared to the patients who did not zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso bacteria predominated in this zzso We showed that the use of zzso antibiotics in pediatric cancer patients was associated with increased resistance rates, which needs further zzso The strategy for zzso zzso therapy for zzso zzso should be adapted to local zzso resistance zzso
