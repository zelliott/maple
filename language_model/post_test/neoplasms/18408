To provide context for the zzso experience in the zzso arthritis zzso zzso clinical development zzso zzso by performing comparisons with similar zzso patients and the general zzso 

zzso outcomes included total zzso zzso zzso skin cancer zzso breast, zzso lung zzso and zzso Comparisons were made between the observed zzso in patients within the zzso zzso and zzso patients on zzso zzso drugs zzso identified from five data zzso the zzso British Columbia zzso zzso the Norfolk Arthritis zzso the National Data Bank for zzso zzso the Sweden Early zzso Register and the General zzso Research zzso Age and zzso zzso rates zzso and zzso zzso ratios zzso were used to compare events in the zzso trials with the zzso zzso zzso and the general zzso

The zzso of total zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso lung zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso were consistent with those in a comparable zzso zzso These data suggest no new safety signals with respect to zzso which will continue to be zzso
