To examine the relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed zzso activity in 16 patients with advanced zzso zzso 

Individual zzso zzso were determined by zzso amplification, followed by restriction zzso length analysis, and compared with observed zzso zzso activity, as determined using the log zzso index of zzso 

All 16 patients had an extensive zzso zzso However, based on the zzso in a distribution of log zzso zzso zzso from healthy volunteers, four of the patients had a poor zzso zzso and there was a general shift of the remaining 12 patients towards a slower zzso zzso This suggests a reduction in zzso activity for all patients relative to healthy zzso A careful analysis of patient medical records failed to reveal any drug interactions or other source for the observed zzso between zzso and zzso 

There are no previous reports of a zzso between zzso and expressed zzso activity in cancer zzso Such a decrease in zzso activity could have an impact on the efficacy and toxicity of zzso agents and other drugs, used in standard zzso zzso
