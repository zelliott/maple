zzso in the human DNA mismatch repair zzso gene zzso are associated with zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso syndrome, zzso and a significant proportion of sporadic zzso zzso The zzso of zzso results in the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso of tumor cells and resistance to the zzso effects of a variety of DNA damaging zzso To study the effect of zzso zzso zzso on cancer zzso we generated a mouse line carrying the zzso zzso zzso that is located in one of the zzso zzso of zzso Although the zzso zzso resulted in DNA repair zzso in zzso zzso mice, it did not affect the zzso cellular response to DNA damage, including the zzso response of zzso cells in the zzso zzso to zzso which was defective in zzso mice but remained normal in zzso zzso Similar to zzso mice, zzso zzso mice displayed a strong cancer predisposition zzso However, in contrast to zzso mice, zzso zzso mice developed significantly fewer zzso tumors, indicating that zzso zzso zzso can affect zzso tumor zzso functions in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso mice were sterile because of the inability of the zzso zzso protein to interact with zzso zzso at zzso demonstrating that the zzso activity of zzso is essential for fertility in zzso
