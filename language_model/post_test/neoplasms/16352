zzso zzso responses may be described by combining three zzso zzso the specificity and zzso functions of a zzso population, zzso the quantity of zzso responses zzso the number of responding T cells within the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of T cells zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Several methods to measure zzso responses are now available including evaluation of zzso precursors using limiting zzso the zzso zzso zzso ex zzso zzso variable zzso analysis determined by flow zzso and zzso length analysis zzso as well as identification of zzso T cells using major zzso complex zzso class I zzso containing appropriate zzso Until now, only a limited set of zzso complexes have been available as zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso or zzso T cells in patients with cancer can be zzso defined using a combination of zzso zzso structure and zzso zzso plus the zzso of an zzso panel directed against 21 individual zzso zzso chains zzso of zzso zzso This approach is instrumental in defining and comparing the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso responses over time in individual patients, in comparing the zzso VA and zzso repertoire in different zzso zzso and in comparing the zzso zzso diversity with that in normal healthy zzso This method provides the means of zzso defining and comparing the zzso repertoire in patients undergoing vaccination protocols and zzso the necessity to zzso the zzso analysis with a qualitative assessment of individual zzso zzso zzso
