zzso in the body are maintained by zzso stem zzso This has been demonstrated both in zzso with high cell turnover rate, such as the bone zzso colon and skin, and in zzso with low cell turnover rate, such as the zzso To maintain zzso in the body it is important to keep tight control over stem cell zzso Stem cells are under strict control from both intrinsic and zzso factors and loss of this control has been zzso to be a key step in the zzso zzso There is increasing evidence that cancer initiation results from zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso in zzso stem cells or their immediate zzso followed by modification of the surrounding zzso zzso of zzso zzso Decades ago, studies on zzso led to the hypothesis that a small subset of zzso cancer stem cells with differentiation potential exists within zzso These studies showed that zzso contain zzso embryonic zzso cells that are able to give rise to differentiated cells which belong to all three germ zzso More recent studies have confirmed cancer stem cells in such diverse zzso as zzso brain and breast zzso It is, however, unclear whether cancer stem cells originate from resident stem cells or whether they arise as a result of an acquired gain of zzso capacity in tissue zzso cells or even more differentiated zzso The characterization of a cancer stem cell profile within diverse cancer types may open up new avenues for cancer zzso In this review we discuss the concept of cancer stem cells and focus on examples where these cells have been zzso
