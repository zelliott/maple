zzso zzso are zzso produced in many zzso and serve as zzso growth factors or indicators in immune response to the zzso zzso zzso deregulation is likely to participate in the development or evolution of the zzso zzso Over the last few years, zzso zzso levels have been correlated with zzso manifestations of cancer and with zzso For instance, serum zzso levels are elevated in both relapsed and zzso Hodgkin's and zzso lymphoma, and these levels correlate with established zzso zzso Furthermore, in diffuse large cell lymphoma, serum zzso level is an independent zzso variable for both complete zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are also elevated in zzso zzso and predict zzso In some cases, it may be that the balance between zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso For instance, in chronic zzso zzso high cellular zzso levels of zzso beta and low levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso are seen in advanced disease and correlate with reduced zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso deregulation are now being investigated, with preliminary data suggesting zzso genetic driving forces, including zzso aberrations and viral zzso
