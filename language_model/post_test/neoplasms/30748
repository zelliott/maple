To determine the potential efficacy and zzso toxicity of zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso 

zzso patients were administered zzso in this phase I clinical trial as a zzso or a zzso infusion repeated every 21 zzso Forty patients received 181 courses on the zzso infusion schedule, and 18 patients received 105 courses on the zzso infusion zzso 

zzso was the zzso toxicity on both zzso The zzso tolerated dose was 100 zzso on the zzso infusion schedule and 115 zzso on the zzso infusion zzso The most prominent zzso zzso included zzso (more prominent on the zzso infusion schedule), transient rash (more common on the zzso infusion schedule), and zzso zzso reactions were seen in five zzso There was no evidence of zzso or zzso One partial response was noted on the zzso infusion schedule (one in zzso breast zzso and four additional partial responses were noted on the zzso infusion schedule zzso in zzso of the zzso one in zzso breast cancer, one in zzso In addition, 10 patients had minor zzso zzso studies showed plasma zzso of zzso declined in a zzso manner, with a terminal zzso of zzso zzso 

The recommended starting dose for phase II zzso trials is 100 zzso administered as a zzso infusion, repeated every 21 zzso zzso is a promising zzso agent worthy of extensive phase II testing in patients with a variety of zzso
