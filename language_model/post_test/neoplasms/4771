zzso how drugs and diseases are associated in the molecular level is of critical importance to unveil disease mechanisms and zzso Until recently, few studies attempt end to discover important gene zzso shared by both drugs and zzso 

Here, we propose a novel presentation of zzso relationship, a zzso which is characterized by closely related drugs, diseases and zzso We first define a network-based gene closeness profile to relate drug to zzso Then, we develop a zzso partition method to identify zzso zzso underlying the gene closeness zzso Genes share similar notable patterns with respect not only to the drugs but also the diseases within a zzso zzso show that our method, zzso achieves a better performance compared with a popular zzso detection method, zzso We apply zzso to a set consisting of zzso drugs, 275 diseases and zzso genes and demonstrate that our zzso approach is able to identify new zzso associations and highlight their molecular zzso Disease zzso emerges as zzso Three zzso are further illustrated in which new drug applications, including the zzso zzso activity of an zzso drug zzso and a cardiovascular zzso agent zzso for zzso as well as potential zzso zzso zzso for zzso are zzso zzso
