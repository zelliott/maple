zzso signaling plays an important role in development and cell fate determination, and it is zzso in human zzso zzso and solid zzso This review includes a brief introduction of the relevant zzso of zzso signaling zzso and primarily focuses on the clinical development of promising agents that either zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or interfere with the zzso zzso interaction by zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso and zzso administered as single agent in early zzso of clinical trials has been observed in advanced or zzso zzso cancer, zzso cell lung cancer, zzso tumors, zzso or zzso tumors, zzso cancer with neuroendocrine features, melanoma and zzso zzso A number of zzso adverse events particularly gastrointestinal zzso emerged and zzso strategies are developed after testing multiple zzso and zzso targeting zzso We also discuss zzso zzso in conjunction with methods of assessment of the molecular target zzso zzso zzso of efficacy or benefit may be of importance for a successful development of this class of zzso
