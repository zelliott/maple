zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is an interesting and intriguing zzso approach in the study of tumor zzso abnormalities when zzso are not zzso This technique can be applied to different types of tumor zzso including imprinted zzso zzso zzso obtained from conventional zzso procedures zzso frozen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extracted from zzso sections zzso zzso is a zzso approach in tumor studies that can give evidence of genetic aberrations present in a small percentage of cells that are likely to escape detection if only molecular techniques are zzso Despite its high sensitivity and versatility, zzso is an indirect zzso method and needs controls to have adequate zzso This study includes present data obtained in zzso experiments using different types of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on different types of normal control zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to define the threshold level for zzso and zzso of different zzso zzso My findings demonstrate that the zzso values depend both on the types of zzso and on the types of target zzso zzso even if zzso is a zzso zzso technique for detecting zzso zzso the lack of accurate controls may result in the zzso of some zzso
