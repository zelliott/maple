Cancer is a common disease and zzso is one well-established treatment for some solid zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso may improve the ability of zzso to kill hypoxic cancer cells, so the administration of zzso while breathing zzso oxygen may result in a reduction in mortality and zzso 

To assess the benefits and harms of zzso while breathing zzso 

In March 2011 we searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso (The Cochrane Library, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reference lists of zzso 

zzso and zzso studies comparing the outcome of zzso zzso following radiation therapy while breathing HBO versus zzso 

Three review authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant trials and extracted the data from the included zzso 

zzso trials contributed to this review zzso zzso zzso allocated to zzso and zzso to zzso With zzso there was a reduction in mortality for head and neck zzso at both one year and five years after therapy zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso number needed to treat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 respectively), as well as improved local zzso control at three months zzso with zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso varied with different zzso zzso Local zzso recurrence was less likely with zzso at one year zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two years zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) and five years zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Any advantage is achieved at the cost of some adverse zzso There was a significant increase in the rate of both severe radiation tissue injury zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso needed to harm zzso zzso 8) and the chance of zzso during therapy zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso 

There is some evidence that zzso improves local zzso control and mortality for zzso of the head and neck, and local zzso recurrence in zzso of the head and neck, and zzso zzso These benefits may only occur with unusual zzso zzso zzso is associated with significant adverse effects including oxygen toxic zzso and severe tissue radiation zzso The zzso and reporting zzso of the studies included demand a cautious zzso More research is needed for head and neck cancer, but is probably not justified for zzso zzso There is little evidence available concerning zzso at other anatomical sites on which to base a zzso
