The aim of this prospective study was to assess the safety and tumor response of zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of surgically zzso and zzso liver zzso 

zzso zzso patients with zzso cancer to the liver from various solid tumors, with tumor progression despite zzso were zzso All patients had baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scan for the assessment of zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso zzso zzso and 19 patients were treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso (but not zzso respectively, on a zzso basis and were monitored over 3 months after last treatment using dedicated zzso corrected zzso For each patient, regions of interest zzso were drawn along the liver edge to measure total liver standard zzso value zzso on zzso images covering the entire liver for comparing zzso and zzso total liver zzso zzso 

There was a significant zzso in total liver zzso after treatment by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso of the mean percentage reduction of tumor metabolism between these two agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso None of the patients in the zzso group developed zzso whereas 3 patients had complications related to zzso (1 transient and 2 zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that there is significant mean reduction of zzso zzso tumor load zzso as evaluated zzso by PET after zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso disease to the zzso The zzso therapy provides encouraging and safe results by arresting the progression of zzso cancer to the liver with decreasing tumor zzso
