Increased physical activity zzso is associated with a reduced risk of several zzso PA may reduce cancer risk by changing zzso hormones levels, but relatively little research has focused on this zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the relation between PA and zzso hormone zzso 

A zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso women included as controls in zzso studies on zzso hormones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth zzso levels, and cancer risk zzso within European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort was zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed to compare geometric mean levels of hormones and zzso by categories of zzso 

In zzso women, active women had zzso significantly lower zzso of zzso zzso lower testosterone, and zzso lower free testosterone than inactive women, while no differences were observed for zzso zzso zzso and growth zzso In zzso women, active women had zzso significantly lower zzso and zzso lower free zzso zzso than inactive women, while no differences were observed for the other hormones and zzso More vigorous forms of physical activity were associated with higher zzso growth zzso zzso Adjustment for body mass index did not alter the zzso Overall, the percentage of zzso in hormone zzso explained by PA levels was zzso 

Our results support the hypothesis of an influence, although small in zzso of PA on sex hormone levels in blood, independent of body zzso
