Both zzso zzso and zzso of the immune response have specialized mechanisms to lyse tumor cells, zzso cells and other zzso The zzso components of the zzso response are zzso and complement, while zzso T zzso zzso and natural killer zzso cells are among the potent zzso agents of the zzso immune zzso The past few years have witnessed remarkable progress in defining the zzso molecules and mechanisms involved in zzso zzso The recognition of target cells by zzso is zzso specific and restricted through the major zzso complex zzso The molecular structure involved in the recognition function is the T cell zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso the activity of zzso cells in non zzso specific and non zzso zzso Several surface molecules of zzso zzso have been identified as zzso zzso A particular role seems to be played by a family of molecules named zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Once the binding between zzso and target cell has occurred, a cascade of events can be triggered leading the killer zzso to deliver the lethal hit against the target zzso At least two categories of zzso molecules are produced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a protein stored in the zzso zzso which forms pores in the plasma membrane of target cell leading to zzso zzso The other category of zzso factors is the group of soluble zzso which includes zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso Their exact mechanism of action is presently zzso Several cellular components are involved in the zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso which, upon zzso release a number of zzso factors by directed zzso and the zzso components which, zzso their organization, participate in the binding and killing zzso A growing body of evidence has recently supplied proof that target cells may play an active role in their own zzso supporting the challenging opinion of an induced suicide zzso
