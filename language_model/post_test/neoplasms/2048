Analysis of zzso of zzso zzso (a model of solid zzso in terms of cellular zzso showed that zzso of zzso is determined by four zzso total cell number, two parameters zzso lethal dose and zzso zzso of cellular zzso and critical cell zzso For example, an increase of cell number and two parameters make zzso more zzso while an increase of critical cell number makes them more zzso Various therapy modes could be analyzed by this analysis: Increased zzso of larger tumors could be attributed mostly to increased cell number and increased cellular zzso zzso by fast zzso could be due to increased zzso of composite zzso zzso showed a critical cell number below 1, indicating a killing mechanism different from zzso One of the future areas to be explored for better therapy mode could be how to increase the critical cell number through modification of environmental conditions zzso making the zzso cells more able to survive or easy to zzso
