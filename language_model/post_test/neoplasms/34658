zzso zzso growth factor zzso blockade has been validated clinically as a treatment for human zzso yet virtually all patients eventually develop progressive disease during zzso In order to dissect this phenomenon, we examined the effect of sustained zzso blockade in a model of advanced pediatric zzso Treatment of late-stage zzso zzso resulted in the initial collapse of the zzso and significant tumor zzso However, during sustained treatment, vessels recovered, concurrent with a striking increase in tumor expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso zzso was expressed at the periphery of surviving clusters of tumor cells, both zzso zzso and zzso accumulated zzso to central zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso maintained despite circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso survival signaling via zzso zzso These findings provide a novel mechanism for vascular survival during sustained zzso blockade and indicate a role for zzso zzso molecules that zzso and release biologically active zzso
