The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso can bind to small zzso and keep them in a biologically inactive state in zzso through which it affects zzso zzso and cell zzso However, mechanisms underlying how zzso regulates zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso remain largely zzso Our previous studies reported that zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso via its zzso domain and zzso modulated zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso Here, we identified that zzso zzso specifically occurred at zzso which was inhibited by zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso zzso at zzso was crucial for zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation as well as cancer cell zzso Moreover, zzso had a much higher binding affinity to small zzso zzso compared with the zzso form of zzso Taken together, our study demonstrated a novel modification of zzso zzso at zzso which played a key role in regulating zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso The zzso regulation of zzso zzso by the zzso domain of zzso may account for zzso of cancer cell invasion and zzso by zzso
