zzso zzso protein 1 zzso might have potential zzso properties and participate in regulatory networks for zzso Although zzso is described as a zzso regulator, the nuclear import machinery of zzso remains zzso We found, using a point zzso that zzso formation was not committed to the nuclear zzso of zzso and, using deletion zzso that the zzso half of zzso zzso a potential nuclear zzso signal zzso Wild type, but not zzso of this region, alone was sufficient to drive the zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso into the zzso zzso a synthetic zzso that blocks the zzso zzso pathway, impaired nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso We also used the binding properties of zzso to demonstrate that this region is an zzso Furthermore, the zzso regulator function of zzso was dependent on its nuclear zzso activity in zzso Taken together, these results show that the region with a zzso motif constitutes a functional nuclear import sequence in zzso that is independent of zzso zzso zzso The identification of an zzso zzso thus zzso the mechanism through which zzso zzso to the nucleus to regulate the zzso of genes involved in zzso and zzso
