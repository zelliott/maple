zzso filament are characteristically present in zzso cells and tumors, but have also been detected in many normal and zzso zzso cell types using zzso zzso To investigate the zzso of this seemingly zzso protein zzso we applied the highly sensitive zzso chain reaction zzso technique to study zzso gene expression in a variety of zzso zzso Total zzso was extracted from nine samples of zzso four zzso lymphoma, seven normal bone zzso normal zzso zzso normal peripheral blood cells, freshly isolated and cultured zzso cells, cultured skin zzso and the zzso leukemia cell line zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the three most primitive zzso types zzso 18, and zzso were zzso using published gene zzso zzso from the breast zzso cell line zzso known to be rich in all three zzso was used as positive zzso zzso run zzso zzso were used to confirm zzso zzso After an initial cycle with reverse zzso zzso amplification was performed for 30 zzso Southern blots of the zzso products showed zzso intense bands corresponding to zzso 8 and 18 gene products in all samples, offering conclusive evidence of zzso gene expression in cells of both zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso 19 gene zzso was not nearly so zzso being detected in normal zzso and zzso cells, two of four zzso zzso and four of nine zzso but not in normal zzso zzso peripheral blood cells, zzso cells, or any of the seven normal bone zzso zzso zzso experiments showed zzso to be highly sensitive in the detection of zzso 19 gene zzso capable of registering one zzso cell in zzso zzso zzso These studies show that variable levels of zzso 8 and 18 gene expression may be detected by zzso in a wide variety of zzso zzso supporting previous zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso 19 gene expression appears to be more restricted and was not evident in any zzso cells devoid of zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso in the detection of zzso zzso in certain sites, particularly bone zzso
