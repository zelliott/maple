We evaluated the safety, maximum tolerated dose, zzso and biological effects of the combination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso 

A standard 3 + 3 phase I zzso design was used with a zzso cycle zzso daily and zzso for 21 days, by zzso 

Fifty patients were zzso 43 reached restaging evaluation after cycle zzso The most common side effects were grade 1 to 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso toxicity was zzso and the recommended phase II dose is zzso 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso Despite the low doses of zzso one quarter of patients had zzso or zzso reduction in zzso zzso Interestingly, six of eight patients with zzso zzso cancer had durable stable disease zzso zzso 3) or partial zzso zzso zzso zzso lasting 12 to zzso zzso Five of the six zzso had available zzso and zzso gene zzso were identified in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso stable disease was also seen in nine patients as zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso 4; zzso to zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso 2; 7 and 11 zzso and one each of melanoma zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso (6 zzso and pancreatic cancer (6 zzso 

Our study shows that the combination of zzso and zzso is well zzso zzso was seen, especially in patients with zzso zzso cancer, a tumor characterized by zzso zzso
