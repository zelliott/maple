To present a method to evaluate the dose mapping error introduced by the dose mapping zzso In addition, apply the method to evaluate the dose mapping error introduced by the zzso dose calculation process implemented in a research version of commercial treatment planning system for a patient zzso 

The average dose accumulated in a finite volume should be unchanged when the dose delivered to one zzso instance of that volume is mapped to a different zzso zzso that the tissue deformation between the zzso instances is mass zzso The average dose to a finite volume on image S is defined as zzso where zzso is the energy deposited in the mass zzso contained in the zzso Since mass and energy should be zzso when zzso is mapped to an image zzso the mean dose mapping error is defined as zzso where the zzso and zzso are integral doses zzso zzso and zzso and zzso are the masses within the region of interest zzso on image R and the corresponding zzso on image zzso where R and S are the two zzso instances from the same zzso zzso application of simple differential propagation yields the differential dose mapping error, zzso zzso with zzso A zzso treatment plan on a zzso zzso lung patient is used to demonstrate the dose mapping error evaluations for a patient case, in which the accumulated dose, zzso zzso and associated error values zzso and zzso are calculated for a zzso spaced set of zzso 

For the single sample patient dose distribution, the average accumulated differential dose mapping error is zzso the average absolute differential dose mapping error is zzso and the average accumulated mean dose mapping error is zzso zzso differential dose mapping errors within the gross tumor volume zzso and planning target volume zzso are lower, zzso and zzso zzso 

A method has been presented to evaluate the dose mapping error introduced by the dose mapping zzso This method has been applied to evaluate the zzso dose calculation process implemented in a commercial treatment planning zzso The method could potentially be developed as a zzso zzso method in image guided zzso radiation therapy zzso
