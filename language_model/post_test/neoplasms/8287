Defining the key players in normal breast differentiation is instrumental to understanding how zzso becomes defective during breast cancer zzso During the past 2 decades much effort has been devoted to the development of technologies for zzso and expansion of primary human breast cells in culture and zzso a relevant zzso which may help to define the niche that regulates breast differentiation and zzso In contrast to the general property of cancer, normal human cells have a finite zzso After a defined number of population zzso normal cells enter an irreversible zzso state referred to as zzso zzso To overcome this obstacle for continuous long-term studies, zzso zzso can be zzso by treatment of cells with chemical agents such as zzso by radiation or by zzso with viral zzso or the gene for human zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso A drawback of some of these protocols is a concurrent introduction of zzso changes, which sometimes leads to a transformed zzso and selection of a zzso which may not be representative of the tissue of zzso In recent years, we have sought to establish immortalized primary breast cells, which retain crucial characteristics of their original in zzso tissue zzso This review discusses various approaches to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells and the application of such cell lines for studies on human breast zzso
