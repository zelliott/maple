zzso zzso of zzso a humanized zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso were determined after multiple intravenous infusions of zzso ranging from 5 zzso to an absolute dose of 100 zzso in patients with advanced or zzso zzso In total, zzso serum zzso from 60 patients in three Phase I and II clinical studies were zzso The structural model incorporated two disposition compartments and two parallel elimination pathways from the central zzso one linear and one zzso Finally estimated zzso parameters zzso were: linear clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso central distribution volume zzso zzso zzso peripheral volume V2 zzso zzso zzso clearance Q zzso zzso zzso for the zzso clearance zzso was zzso zzso (25) and zzso zzso zzso zzso At serum zzso between approximately 20 zzso and 7 zzso the effect of the zzso clearance on zzso was zzso Only at zzso zzso did zzso dominate overall zzso zzso zzso was 57% for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso and was larger than the zzso zzso of zzso Of the many investigated patient zzso only body weight was found to contribute to the population zzso It significantly affected zzso zzso V2 and zzso resulting in marked differences in the zzso zzso profiles after multiple dosing in patients with low and high body zzso In conclusion, a robust population zzso model was developed and evaluated for zzso which identified a possible need to consider body weight when designing dosage regimen for future clinical cancer zzso
