zzso for genes zzso zzso receptors may explain some zzso in zzso zzso Experimental studies show that zzso and zzso are less effective in individuals carrying zzso zzso caused by the 118 A zzso G zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso The purpose of the study was to investigate whether this and other genetic zzso in zzso influence the efficacy of zzso in cancer pain zzso 

We screened zzso cancer pain patients on oral zzso treatment for four frequent zzso gene zzso The zzso were the zzso G zzso T zzso in the zzso region of zzso 1, the 118 A zzso G zzso in zzso 1, and the zzso + 31 G zzso A and zzso + zzso G zzso C zzso both in zzso zzso Ninety-nine patients with adequately controlled pain were included in an analysis comparing zzso doses and serum zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the different zzso for the zzso zzso 

No differences related to the zzso G zzso zzso the zzso + 31 G zzso A and the zzso + zzso G zzso C zzso were zzso Patients zzso for the zzso G zzso of the 118 A zzso G zzso zzso zzso 4) needed more zzso to achieve pain control, compared to zzso zzso zzso 17) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference was not explained by other factors such as duration of zzso treatment, performance status, time since diagnosis, time until death, or adverse zzso 

Patients zzso for the 118 G zzso of the zzso zzso need higher zzso doses to achieve pain zzso Thus, genetic variation at the gene zzso the zzso zzso contributes to zzso in patients' responses to zzso
