Cancer risk assessment is a multidisciplinary process that goes beyond the scope of classical epidemiology to include the biological evaluation of individual differences to zzso zzso The inclusion of genetic zzso such as zzso sensitivity or zzso zzso zzso zzso end points into risk assessment models allows for a more comprehensive determination of cancer risk that includes known demographic (age and zzso lifestyle zzso zzso and zzso and occupational or environmental zzso The zzso zzso generates multiple correlated end points that, after applying data reduction methods, could be combined into a summary measure that incorporates information from each individual variable into a single (or possible zzso zzso measure of zzso In this article, we highlight the use of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate the potential use of the combined summary measures in cancer risk assessment as a result of chronic exposure to tobacco zzso The zzso zzso and sensitivity of the zzso zzso not only make it a valuable tool for screening but also the multiple end points simultaneously generated lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the zzso process that could in turn substantially improve risk zzso
