zzso mechanisms of drug action remains a fundamental impediment to the development and effective use of zzso Here we describe an zzso interference zzso strategy to characterize zzso function in zzso zzso By examining the response of cells expressing short hairpin zzso zzso to a diverse selection of zzso we could generate a functional zzso signature that was able to accurately group drugs into established zzso modes of zzso This, in turn, provided a zzso sampled reference set for high-resolution prediction of mechanisms of action for poorly characterized small zzso We could further reduce the zzso zzso target set to as few as eight genes and, by using a newly derived zzso zzso approach, could extend the zzso power of this zzso set to characterize additional drug zzso Thus, a focused zzso zzso signature can provide a highly sensitive and zzso approach for characterizing new zzso zzso
