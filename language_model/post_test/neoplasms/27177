In order to map the zzso or membrane zzso associated with the zzso and the zzso in an embryonic zzso in zzso we developed a zzso technique for chicken zzso and combined it with mass zzso and zzso zzso We also applied this procedure to implanted tumors growing on the zzso membrane or after the induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were the most abundant components zzso Relative quantitative analysis revealed differential protein expression patterns in several zzso Through a zzso approach, we determined zzso cell protein expression signatures, which allowed us to identify several proteins not yet reported to be associated with zzso cells or the zzso This is the first study reported so far that applies in zzso zzso in combination with robust zzso quantitative zzso approaches and zzso analysis, to an embryonic zzso It also provides the first description of the vascular and zzso zzso of the zzso that might constitute the starting point for further zzso
