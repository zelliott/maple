zzso with zzso zzso T cells may induce zzso zzso reactions to zzso zzso T cells, which are involved in zzso zzso However, it is unknown whether attenuated activated healthy zzso zzso zzso could increase zzso immune zzso To this end, zzso mice were zzso with attenuated activated zzso T zzso The zzso from zzso mice showed a higher zzso ability than that from zzso zzso The special zzso analysis showed that there were more zzso T cells and zzso T cells in zzso mice after 24 h of culture with zzso fetal calf serum complete medium in zzso zzso These results demonstrated that this zzso may activate T cells in zzso Furthermore, the zzso from zzso mice revealed resistance to zzso cell death zzso in zzso To further study the relative genes that are responsible for the higher proliferation and resistance to zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured by real-time zzso The results indicated that zzso zzso was higher in the zzso from zzso mice than that in the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso expression showed a parallel higher, but zzso did not change zzso To investigate the zzso functions induced by zzso in zzso a tumor model was established by zzso tumor cell zzso in zzso zzso Mice receiving zzso zzso zzso had significantly inhibited tumor growth in zzso zzso This study implicated that zzso with attenuated activated zzso T cells enhances zzso immune responses that participate in tumor growth zzso
