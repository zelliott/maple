The process of cancer zzso is sequential and selective and contains zzso zzso The growth of zzso represents the zzso of many lethal events that only few zzso cells zzso zzso zzso contain cells with zzso zzso properties, and the outcome of zzso depends on the interplay of zzso cells with various host zzso zzso then, our studies and most data reported by others have led us to conclude that zzso is a highly selective process regulated by a number of zzso This belief is contrary to the once widely accepted notion that zzso dissemination is the ultimate expression of cellular zzso In fact, suggesting that cancer zzso is a selective process is a more optimistic view in terms of cancer therapy than the one that contends that zzso dissemination is an entirely random zzso A selective biological process is regulated by the interaction of zzso cells with their host, and these complex interactions can be studied and zzso A better understanding of the complexity of the processes of zzso evolution, zzso and zzso should lead to improvements in the treatment of zzso
