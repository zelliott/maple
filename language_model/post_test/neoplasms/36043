zzso progression and pregnancy share many common features, such as immune tolerance and zzso The invasion of zzso in the zzso into the zzso wall is essential for fetal development, and is thus precisely zzso Its deregulation has been implicated in zzso a leading cause for maternal and zzso mortality and zzso zzso of zzso remains to be zzso zzso gene profiling has been widely used for identifying genes responsible for zzso In this review, we have summarized the recent data from the zzso studies with zzso zzso Despite the complex of gene signatures, suggestive of the zzso of zzso these studies identified a number of zzso expressed genes associated with zzso Interestingly, most of them have been reported to be tightly involved in tumor zzso We have discussed these interesting genes and analyzed their potential molecular functions in zzso compared with their roles in zzso zzso Further investigations are warranted to explore the involvement in molecular network of each identified zzso which may provide not only novel strategies for prevention and therapy for zzso but also a better understanding of cancer zzso The zzso cells, with their capacity for proliferation and zzso zzso and survival, migration, zzso and immune zzso by exploiting similar molecular zzso make them a compelling model for cancer zzso
