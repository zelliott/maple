Cancer growth and zzso are regulated in part by zzso cells such as zzso and immune cells within the tumor zzso zzso cells zzso are also ubiquitous within tumors because tumors are zzso and yet, the impact of zzso zzso is less well zzso Through zzso regulation, zzso zzso a diverse spectrum of zzso processes in normal and zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso offer similar zzso regulatory control of cancer zzso Indeed, zzso from zzso zzso muted the zzso and invasive zzso of lung and breast cancer cells in zzso and reduced cancer cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly changed this regulatory relationship, eliminating the ability of zzso to inhibit cancer cell zzso via increased zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso embedded within porous zzso slowed adjacent zzso tumor growth and prevented architectural zzso with a zzso reduction in zzso and zzso zzso Finally, lung zzso cells zzso with intact zzso media, but not media zzso with zzso zzso exhibited reduced zzso burden after tail vein zzso These findings add to an emerging appreciation of zzso effects that transcend their structural roles and pave the way for improved characterization and control of zzso zzso interactions for diagnosis, zzso and treatment of zzso
