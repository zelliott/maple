zzso cancer therapy relies on zzso diffusion for drug distribution in solid zzso A zzso understanding of how tumor components affect diffusion is necessary to advance cancer drug zzso Yet, because of limitations in current techniques, it is unclear how individual tissue components hinder zzso We developed zzso zzso recovery after zzso zzso to address this zzso zzso zzso facilitated by zzso distinguish the zzso hindrance of the zzso versus cellular constituents in living zzso Using zzso diffusion zzso in zzso we resolved the contributions of these two major tissue components toward zzso zzso transport in solid tumors and subcutaneous tissue in zzso We further used zzso in zzso zzso gels and in zzso to show the influence of physical interactions between collagen and zzso on zzso hindrance through the zzso Through these studies, we show that zzso zzso paradoxically improves diffusion and that reducing zzso enhances zzso zzso transport in solid zzso
