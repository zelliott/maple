To review all cases of concurrent zzso and solid tumors diagnosed at our Department over a 15-year period and explore evidence that would support the notion of zzso being a true zzso zzso 

We reviewed the records of all patients diagnosed with zzso and solid tumors within 12 months of each other and zzso followed until death or our zzso We analyzed the main features and outcome of zzso in this zzso We also reviewed all cases published in the zzso zzso 

Fifteen patients (9 men and 6 zzso in whom both zzso and solid tumor occurred within the same 12 months were zzso Mean age was zzso years zzso zzso In 7 cases the diagnosis of zzso zzso that of cancer, in 6 both processes were zzso zzso and in 2 zzso appeared after cancer zzso The most common zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), and giant cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso of urinary zzso zzso lung zzso and gastrointestinal tract zzso The median followup was zzso months zzso zzso Thirteen of the 15 patients demonstrated zzso of disease activity and treatment response for both cancer and zzso zzso flared heralding tumor recurrence or progression in 7 zzso zzso 

In our patients, resolution of zzso following effective treatment of the zzso linked zzso and recurrence of zzso heralding tumor recurrence or zzso provide strong evidence for zzso being a true zzso zzso zzso or persistent zzso with poor response to usually effective therapy, especially in elderly patients, should raise questions about underlying zzso
