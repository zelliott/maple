This study was conducted to define a new maximum tolerated dose and the zzso toxicity zzso of zzso and zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso when used with the zzso agent zzso zzso patients with various types of zzso who were ineligible for zzso zzso protocols were entered on a phase I study of escalating doses of zzso beginning at 220 zzso and advancing by 20 zzso increments in planned zzso of 4 to 8 patients until severe zzso toxicity zzso was zzso In all patients, zzso zzso zzso was given on 2 occasions before the first zzso dose zzso 24 hours before and again 15 minutes zzso zzso was given 24 hours after the first zzso zzso zzso was given in doses up to and including 300 zzso Hematologic depression was profound, although it was rapidly and equally zzso at all zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was substantial, it was not the zzso and some patients given the highest zzso doses zzso 300 zzso did not develop zzso zzso The zzso was not clearly zzso zzso toxicity in the form of zzso zzso occurred in 3 of 36 patients treated with zzso doses zzso zzso and was deemed fatal in 1 patient given zzso 300 zzso (Another patient with a known zzso was given zzso 220 zzso and died as a result of heart failure but did not have zzso zzso Another patient given zzso 300 zzso died of zzso zzso The maximum tolerated dose of zzso in this setting was thus considered to be 280 zzso and 27 patients were given this dose without severe zzso Moreover, 38 patients were zzso for delayed toxicity related to zzso none was zzso zzso responses have been noted at all zzso doses and in all diagnostic groups, and 21 patients are alive at median day zzso zzso day zzso to day zzso including 16 without evidence of disease progression at median day zzso zzso day zzso to day zzso zzso and zzso permit the safe use of zzso 280 zzso an apparent increase over the dose of zzso that can be safely administered with zzso but without zzso Further studies are needed not only to confirm these findings, but also to define the zzso efficacy of this zzso Finally, it may be possible to evaluate additional methods of further dose escalation of zzso in this zzso
