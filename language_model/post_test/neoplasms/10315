The potentially functional zzso zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in cancer risk, but individually published studies show zzso zzso To derive a more precise zzso of the association between the zzso zzso and risk of cancer, we performed a zzso of 19 published studies that included zzso cancer cases and zzso zzso We used odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso to assess the strength of the zzso Overall, the zzso CT and zzso zzso zzso were associated with a significantly reduced cancer risk of all cancer types in different genetic models zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dominant model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the risk remained for studies of the zzso zzso and Asian zzso or zzso studies in all the genetic zzso Although some modest bias could not be zzso this zzso suggests that the zzso zzso T zzso has a possible protective effect on cancer zzso
