To compare the zzso and microscopic zzso of the novel zzso zzso zzso copper zzso zzso zzso zzso potentially useful for zzso zzso therapy zzso with those of its zinc fluorescent zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso then injected zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by determining average zzso zzso in zzso blood, brain, skin, and liver using zzso zzso The zzso mice and their vital zzso were photographed first under an ultraviolet lamp and then under a bright fluorescent zzso Thin sections of liver and tumor were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso but not zzso mice bearing subcutaneous tumors showed zzso from liver, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in various zzso were similar in mice whether injected with zzso or zzso zzso of zzso liver sections showed zzso zzso from zzso cells in a zzso zzso distribution evenly throughout the zzso In the tumors zzso such zzso was also zzso but unlike liver fluorescence, was zzso zzso 

zzso serves as a useful fluorescent experimental surrogate for zzso to delineate its zzso and microscopic zzso in zzso and zzso
