Besides chemotherapy drugs, a number of zzso factors zzso zzso age, history of alcohol consumption, and/or motion zzso may be used to calculate the risk for zzso zzso We evaluated data with the intent of identifying a unique variable associated with delayed vomiting in patients receiving moderately zzso chemotherapy zzso 

From an ongoing research study, the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and substance P were measured over a zzso period in 25 patients receiving zzso All patients were treated with a zzso zzso zzso plus zzso according to published zzso none received zzso zzso zzso zzso and serum substance P values were grouped according to the development zzso or absence zzso of delayed zzso zzso mean values associated with the two zzso were analyzed by analysis of zzso 

Eleven patients developed moderate to severe delayed zzso the other 14 were zzso The zzso log zzso zzso was zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso groups, respectively, p zzso zzso the zzso log zzso substance P) for the same respective groups was zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso The log zzso ratio of substance P to zzso zzso difference in those with and without zzso was zzso and zzso respectively, p zzso zzso The zzso and ratio of substance P to zzso data were also used to determine zzso points which resulted in the optimal zzso zzso 

These preliminary findings suggest that an elevated zzso ratio of substance P to zzso zzso is associated with the development of delayed vomiting induced by zzso
