zzso deficient hypoxic cells, which are resistant to sparsely zzso radiation, have now been identified in most animal and some human solid zzso and will influence the response of those zzso to radiation zzso This zzso can be either zzso arising from an oxygen diffusion zzso or zzso resulting from transient zzso in zzso blood zzso Although clinical attempts to overcome zzso have met with some success, the results have been far from zzso and efforts are still being made to find better zzso zzso experimental studies, especially in the last decade, have shown that zzso and structurally related zzso can effectively zzso zzso zzso to both single and zzso radiation treatments and that they do so in preference to the effects seen in mouse normal zzso The earliest studies suggested that this enhancement of radiation damage was the result of an zzso of the repair mechanisms, as was well documented in zzso However, recent studies in mouse zzso have shown that the primary mode of action actually involves a reduction in zzso zzso More specifically, these drugs prevent transient zzso in blood flow, thus zzso the development of acute zzso This novel discovery led to the suggestion that the potential role of these agents as zzso would be when combined with treatments that overcame chronic zzso The first attempt to demonstrate this combined zzso with zzso and found that the enhancement of radiation damage by both agents together was greater than that seen with each agent zzso Similar results were later seen for zzso combined with a zzso zzso zzso breathing, and zzso and in all these studies the effects in zzso were always greater than those seen in appropriate normal zzso Of all the zzso it is zzso itself which has been the most extensively studied as a zzso in zzso and the one that shows the greatest effect in animal zzso It is also an agent that has been well established clinically for the treatment of a variety of disorders, with daily doses of up to 6 g being considered reasonably safe and associated with a low zzso of side zzso This human dose is equivalent to zzso zzso in mice and such doses will zzso sensitize zzso zzso to zzso These findings have now resulted in phase zzso clinical trials of zzso in combination with zzso breathing, as a potential zzso zzso
