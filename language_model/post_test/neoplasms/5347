To zzso the role of zzso growth factors zzso and other zzso in the zzso or zzso regulation of zzso zzso we studied zzso gene expression in the bone zzso zzso of patients after zzso zzso Furthermore, we studied the zzso gene expression profile in healthy individuals before and after bone zzso harvesting for the purpose of bone zzso zzso We speculated that the bone zzso harvesting procedure might induce changes in zzso gene zzso No induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed in the zzso of patients following intensive zzso Also, no zzso of expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IGF-1, zzso and zzso gene was found, illustrating that the investigated zzso probably are not relevant in the presumed zzso regulation of the recovery of zzso following depletion of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso elevated zzso plasma levels were found in these patients, suggesting that zzso has an zzso regulatory role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not of zzso or zzso gene expression and zzso of zzso beta and zzso gene following zzso harvesting was zzso This induction of zzso and zzso may be attributed to tissue damage rather than to zzso zzso
