Numerous studies suggest that generation of zzso stress could be useful in cancer zzso In this study, we zzso in zzso and in zzso the zzso potential of zzso stress induced by zzso zzso This combination of a reducing agent zzso and a zzso active zzso zzso generates zzso cycling leading to formation of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso was tested in several cell types including zzso cells (a stable zzso leukemia cell zzso freshly isolated zzso from patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso cells (a zzso zzso cell line) zzso with zzso and peripheral blood zzso derived from healthy zzso Although these latter cells were resistant to zzso survival of all the other cell lines was markedly reduced, including the zzso cells expressing either zzso or zzso zzso In a standard in zzso model of subcutaneous tumor zzso zzso provoked a significant delay in the proliferation of zzso and zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso form of zzso No effect of zzso was observed when these latter cells were injected into blood of mice most probably because of the high zzso potential of red blood cells, as shown by in zzso zzso We zzso that cancer cells are more sensitive to zzso than healthy cells because of their lack of zzso zzso mainly zzso The mechanism underlying this zzso involves the zzso zzso of zzso with a subsequent loss of its zzso function thus leading to degradation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
