The zzso of a novel zzso complex, zzso zzso zzso has been evaluated in zzso against a panel of human tumor cell lines zzso zzso representative of models of intrinsic and acquired to zzso In addition, the activity of zzso administered by the zzso route has been determined in zzso using the zzso zzso zzso and four human zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso against seven human zzso zzso cell lines, zzso showed similar zzso and pattern of zzso to zzso zzso 50% zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The zzso of zzso was more dependent on the time of drug exposure than that of zzso suggesting that extended zzso rather than a single zzso administration might be a more appropriate schedule in zzso Using six pairs of acquired zzso and parent human tumor cell lines (four zzso one zzso and one zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso in three whereas zzso exhibited partial or full zzso in all six zzso zzso in two of the acquired zzso lines zzso and zzso where zzso retained activity, resistance has previously shown to be due primarily to reduced platinum zzso In zzso following zzso administration using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso selectivity far superior to that observed for either zzso zzso or zzso Across four human zzso zzso zzso of widely differing sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity, broadly comparable to that observed for zzso administered zzso and zzso and markedly superior to zzso administered zzso These zzso properties suggest that zzso provides a structural lead to platinum complexes which may circumvent zzso acquired resistance to zzso and is a suitable candidate as an zzso zzso platinum complex for phase I clinical zzso
