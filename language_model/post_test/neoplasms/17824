Although the immune system is capable of mounting a response against many zzso that response is insufficient for tumor zzso in most patients due to factors in the tumor zzso that defeat tumor zzso We previously identified the zzso zzso zzso as zzso on primary B cell chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells and demonstrated negative immune regulation by zzso and other tumor cells zzso zzso in zzso In this study we developed a novel animal model that incorporates human immune cells and human tumor cells to address the effects of zzso zzso on tumor cells in zzso and to assess the effect of targeting zzso in the presence of human immune zzso Although human zzso cells prevented tumor growth when tumor cells did not express zzso zzso zzso inhibited the ability of zzso to eradicate tumor zzso zzso zzso administration to mice bearing zzso tumors resulted in nearly complete tumor growth zzso even in the context of established zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso with zzso zzso function provided evidence that blocking of the zzso interaction was sufficient for control of zzso immune zzso and tumor growth zzso in this zzso Our data indicate that zzso expression by tumor cells suppresses zzso responses and suggest that zzso treatment might be zzso beneficial for treating zzso zzso
