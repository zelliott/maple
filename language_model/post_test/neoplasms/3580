zzso zzso is caused by a diverse combination of accelerated protein breakdown and slowed protein zzso The hypothesis proposed in this study is that supplementation of specific nutrients known to positively support protein synthesis and reduce protein breakdown will reverse the zzso process in advanced cancer zzso 

Patients with solid tumors who had demonstrated a weight loss of at least zzso were considered for the zzso Patients were randomly assigned in a zzso fashion to either an zzso control mixture of zzso zzso acids or an experimental treatment containing zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary outcomes measured were the change in body mass and zzso mass zzso which were assessed at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 zzso 

zzso patients zzso control, 18 zzso were evaluated at the zzso zzso The patients supplemented with zzso gained zzso zzso zzso zzso of body mass in 4 weeks, whereas control subjects lost zzso zzso zzso zzso during the same time zzso This gain was the result of a significant increase in zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the subjects supplemented with the control lost zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The response to zzso of supplementation was evaluated by an zzso statistical zzso The effect of zzso on zzso increase was maintained over the 24 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast over time, P zzso There was no negative effect of treatment on the zzso of adverse effects or quality of life zzso 

The mixture of zzso was effective in increasing zzso of advanced zzso zzso zzso The exact reasons for this improvement will require further investigation, but could be attributed to the observed effects of zzso on slowing rates of protein breakdown, with improvements in protein synthesis observed with zzso and zzso
