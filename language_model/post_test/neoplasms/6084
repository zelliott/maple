The zzso of a blood vessel is essential for providing blood to any given zzso Here, we discuss the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying vascular zzso formation in zzso and zzso and highlight a new hypothesis describing oxygen transport in human zzso zzso 

Several cellular mechanisms exist for blood vessel formation, that is zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which might follow common molecular principles to form a vascular zzso The latter includes zzso zzso and generation of zzso zzso cell surfaces, zzso zzso of these cell surfaces to create a small zzso between two or more zzso zzso cells or a cavity within an zzso cell, and zzso expansion or extension of the vascular zzso Whereas these events require zzso cells, vascular zzso formation in zzso mostly occurs in their zzso As zzso targeting zzso cells alone does not prevent vascular supply and growth of human zzso tumors, the possibility exists that some tumors employ zzso mechanisms of vascular zzso zzso 

Whereas the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso vascular zzso formation are beginning to be zzso it is still largely unknown how zzso and some zzso tumors establish a circulatory system in the absence of zzso
