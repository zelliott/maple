zzso fragments of several zzso zzso zzso have been labeled with zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The fragments were incubated with zzso zzso overnight to split zzso zzso process which converts zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso fragments were then either directly labeled with zzso frozen for subsequent zzso or zzso to make kits for zzso at some later zzso The zzso fragments were shown to be stable against zzso when challenged with zzso acid, retained zzso and were capable of binding to human tumor zzso in nude zzso
