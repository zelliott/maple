From 1991 to 1995, we initiated cultures of 94 fresh tumor samples of various zzso in an effort to grow zzso zzso zzso using zzso and subsequent expansion in zzso zzso The five most prevalent tumor types from which zzso were successfully initiated were melanoma zzso successful zzso in 34 tumor samples, zzso success zzso zzso cancer (12 of 18, zzso zzso cell zzso (9 of 12, zzso breast (4 of 5, zzso and zzso (5 of 7, zzso The overall success rate for all tumors was 67 of 94 zzso There were no instances of contamination from the time of culture initiation through harvesting of the final cell product for clinical zzso The mean number of days to reach successful initiation zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso was 35 zzso 24 days zzso zzso zzso zzso were then expanded from these successful zzso for either a repeated zzso therapy zzso zzso numbers of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso or for a repeated high-dose therapy zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean number of days to expand a zzso culture from the time of initiation to treatment for a first zzso zzso was 59 days zzso zzso zzso compared with 80 days zzso zzso zzso for high-dose zzso For patients who received a second or third high-dose zzso treatment, the average number of days needed to expand zzso was 39 days zzso zzso 10) if there was no intervening zzso of zzso compared with 49 days zzso zzso 10) if the culture had to be zzso from zzso zzso For patients who received a second or third zzso zzso the mean number of days needed to expand zzso was 23 days zzso zzso 3) if there was no intervening zzso compared with 42 days zzso zzso 17) if cultures had to be zzso after zzso of zzso zzso zzso displayed predominantly zzso zzso in zzso of 42 cultures, whereas high-dose zzso displayed predominantly zzso zzso in zzso of 44 zzso zzso bearing the natural killer zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso activated killer zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in both low- and high-dose zzso cultures, but these zzso were never zzso zzso testing consistently demonstrated the persistence of zzso and zzso activity in addition to the killing of zzso and zzso melanoma tumor zzso This work confirms that zzso cultures from most tumor types can be successfully established and expanded for therapeutic use, and repeated expansion from continuous zzso culture or zzso zzso for repeated treatments is zzso Such cultures are predominantly T zzso that are zzso heterogeneous, and these zzso do not remain constant during prolonged time in zzso
