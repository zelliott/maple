The zzso findings in patients treated with targeted beta zzso such as zzso are poorly zzso We report a zzso analysis from patients treated with combined external beam therapy and a zzso consisting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso injected into surgically created zzso cavities during brain tumor zzso 

Directed tissue samples of the cavity walls were obtained because of suspected tumor recurrence from 28 zzso zzso and clinical follow-up were evaluated on all patients zzso zzso based on total radiation dose received and a subset of these zzso Group B, zzso therapy zzso who had received external beam therapy within zzso months of zzso therapy and undergoing 26 zzso over 37 zzso zzso outcomes were zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative for zzso zzso analysis was used to assess the casual relation between total absorbed dose zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso observed after zzso therapy were zzso similar to those reported for other types of radiation zzso however, the high localized dose rate and absorbed doses produced by the short range of zzso beta particles seem to have resulted in an earlier zzso reaction in the tumor zzso Among all 28 zzso zzso patients, median survival from tissue analysis after zzso therapy depended on zzso and total radiation absorbed zzso Median survival for patients with tissue classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative for zzso were zzso 15 and zzso months, zzso Without zzso total dose was a significant predictor of survival zzso where patients with higher doses had better zzso For example, median survival in patients receiving a total radiation dose greater than 86 zzso was 19 months compared with 7 months for those receiving less than 86 zzso 

zzso analysis correlated with zzso Among all patients zzso zzso there was a significant correlation between biopsy outcome, survival, and total radiation absorbed zzso Among the Group B zzso therapy patients, the zzso changes were zzso similar to those described for external beam therapy and zzso zzso
