The efficacy of zzso zzso employing zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently limited in most solid zzso The combination of local zzso zzso with zzso has the potential to enhance zzso targeting of zzso moreover, this approach may add an zzso effect to zzso hypoxic and zzso cells and may inhibit the cells from repairing zzso damage or potentially lethal damage caused by zzso zzso There are distinct types of protocols in this zzso zzso temperature and timing relative to zzso administration appear to affect the efficacy of the combination zzso zzso to heating at any particular condition are not always the same among different zzso zzso There are many papers describing influence of zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso but only limited information is currently available on zzso outcomes regarding the dependency of combination zzso A previous study suggested that the best therapeutic improvement would be achieved when zzso was combined immediately after the administration of zzso which significantly increases the radiation absorbed dose to zzso and produces a uniform zzso dose zzso Further therapeutic investigation should be required to reach the optimal protocol of combining these two zzso
