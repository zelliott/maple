zzso is the zzso responsible for maintenance of the length of zzso by addition of zzso repetitive zzso zzso activity is exhibited in zzso and stem and tumor zzso In human zzso cells, proliferation potential is strictly limited and zzso follows approximately zzso cell zzso In most tumor cells, on the contrary, replication potential is zzso The key role in this process of the system of the zzso length maintenance with involvement of zzso is still poorly zzso Undoubtedly, DNA zzso is not capable of completely copying DNA at the very ends of zzso therefore, approximately zzso are lost during each cell cycle, which results in gradual zzso zzso zzso short zzso cause zzso following crisis and cell zzso However, in tumor cells the system of zzso length maintenance is zzso Much work has been done regarding the complex zzso as a unique target, highly specific in cancer zzso zzso have additional proteins that regulate the binding of zzso zzso also associates with a number of proteins forming the sheltering complex having a central role in zzso zzso This review focuses on the structure and function of the zzso complex and its altered behavior leading to disease, mainly zzso Although zzso zzso are not approved yet for clinical use, we can assume that based on the promising in zzso and in zzso results and successful clinical trials, it can be predicted that zzso zzso will be zzso soon in the combat against zzso and degenerative zzso The active search for zzso is zzso because the zzso system is an extremely promising target offering possibilities to decrease or increase the viability of the cell for therapeutic zzso
