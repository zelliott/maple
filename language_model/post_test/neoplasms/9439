Despite growing support for zzso as a promising agent for cancer treatment and possibly cancer zzso few studies have zzso factors that influence zzso zzso This overview summarizes dietary and lifestyle factors that have been shown to affect circulating zzso zzso 

To date, many animal studies and in zzso experiments have illustrated that zzso possesses zzso zzso zzso that are currently being studied include zzso activity as an indirect zzso and free radical zzso its action on the immune system; suppression of fatty acid zzso and zzso and its ability to increase the degradation of zzso and to induce zzso Studies further suggest that zzso reduces local zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso axis and direct actions of zzso at the tumor cell level, thus behaving as a zzso 

Several small clinical trials have demonstrated that zzso has some potential, either alone or in combination with standard cancer therapy, to yield favorable zzso zzso or its precursor zzso have been found in numerous edible plants, but more studies are needed to evaluate the influence of diets rich in zzso and zzso on circulating zzso levels in zzso Age, zzso parity, and the use of certain drugs remain the factors that have been associated most consistently with zzso zzso 

Further insights into the effects of dietary and lifestyle factors that zzso circulating zzso levels may provide the basis for novel interventions to exploit zzso for the prevention and treatment of human zzso
