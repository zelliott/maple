In this paper we consider chemotherapy in a spatial model of tumor zzso The model, which is of zzso type, takes into account the complex interactions between the tumor and surrounding zzso cells by including zzso of zzso cells and the zzso zzso When no treatment is applied the model reproduces the typical dynamics of early tumor zzso The initially avascular tumor reaches a diffusion limited size of the order of zzso and zzso zzso through the release of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso by hypoxic cells in the core of the zzso This stimulates zzso cells to migrate towards the tumor and establishes a zzso supply sufficient for sustained zzso To this model we apply zzso treatment in the form of a zzso which reduces the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso This treatment has the capability to reduce tumor mass, but more importantly, we were able to determine that zzso of zzso cell proliferation is the more important of the two cellular functions targeted by the zzso Further, we considered the application of a zzso drug that targets zzso tumor zzso The drug was treated as a zzso substance entering the tissue from the blood zzso Our results show that depending on the characteristics of the drug it can either reduce the tumor mass significantly or in fact accelerate the growth rate of the zzso This result seems to be due to complicated interplay between the zzso and tumor cell types and highlights the importance of considering chemotherapy in a spatial zzso
