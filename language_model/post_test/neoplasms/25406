Two distinct forms of zzso communication have been found in animal zzso one using the familiar, zzso zzso route and the other using an entirely zzso zzso The zzso route depends on zzso permeable zzso junctions which form at areas of contact between adjacent zzso The junctions contain zzso channels which directly link the zzso of the coupled zzso Small zzso and molecules pass through these channels and move freely between all cells in coupled zzso The structural protein which forms the gap zzso channel has been isolated and zzso It has an apparent zzso of 16,000 and readily forms zzso zzso In the zzso six protein zzso surround the central zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid to cells appears to close the zzso zzso This effect of zzso acid on the zzso zzso of zzso communication may explain some of its biological zzso
