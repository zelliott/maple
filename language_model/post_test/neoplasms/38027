zzso is an zzso zzso that is capable of zzso zzso zzso side chains of zzso zzso zzso on cell surfaces and the zzso zzso activity that is strongly implicated in tumor zzso and zzso Evidence was provided that zzso zzso in human zzso zzso and breast zzso cells results in a marked increase in tissue factor zzso zzso Likewise, zzso was induced by zzso addition of zzso zzso to tumor cells and primary zzso cells, induction that was zzso by zzso zzso and correlated with enhanced zzso zzso zzso induction was further confirmed in zzso transgenic mice and correlated with zzso expression levels in leukemia zzso zzso was also found to be involved in the regulation of tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso It was shown that zzso zzso or zzso addition zzso two- to zzso increase of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the cell culture zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the observed increase in zzso at the protein level and appeared to be independent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Instead, a physical interaction between zzso and zzso was demonstrated, suggesting a mechanism by which zzso zzso interacts with zzso on the cell surface, leading to zzso of zzso from the cell membrane and increased zzso activity, thus further supporting the local zzso function of zzso As zzso are strong zzso of zzso in view of the effect of zzso on zzso pathway, the role of zzso zzso activity may potentially be zzso
