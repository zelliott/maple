The role of the immune system during cancer development is complex involving extensive zzso interactions between genetically altered cells, zzso and innate immune cells, their soluble zzso and structural components present in the zzso zzso Each stage of cancer development is regulated uniquely by the immune system; whereas full zzso of zzso immune cells at the tumor stage may result in zzso of zzso cells, chronic zzso of innate immune cells at sites of zzso growth may actually enhance tumor zzso In addition, the balance between desirable zzso immune responses and zzso zzso chronic inflammatory responses largely depends on the context in which a zzso is zzso The following chapter focuses on the inflammatory components and processes engaged during cancer development and the impact of the inflammatory zzso
