zzso in pediatric zzso remains underestimated, although having a negative impact on zzso zzso nutrition zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso may prevent or reverse zzso zzso We aimed to evaluate both efficacy and safety of early zzso during tumors treatment in zzso 

Medical records of pediatric patients having a zzso tube inserted between 1995 and 2009 were zzso zzso We compared type and zzso of complications in Group 1, including 74 patients suffering from cancer, and control Group 2, including 57 patients with neurological zzso zzso of zzso was evaluated through nutritional parameters zzso weight for height zzso and height for age zzso zzso complications and zzso zzso zzso significance was set for P zzso zzso 

zzso tolerance was similar in both groups, as shown by comparable complication rates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed improvement or stabilization of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso The final height loss was lower zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso when zzso was started at the beginning of the zzso zzso In bone tumors, zzso prevented weight loss during chemotherapy, and tended to zzso surgical zzso relapses and zzso 

Early zzso feeding represents a relatively safe way to prevent zzso in children with cancer, and might play a role in bone tumors zzso zzso Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results and assess the impact of zzso and zzso on quality of zzso
