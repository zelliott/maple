zzso modulated zzso zzso requires dedicated quality assurance zzso Recently, we have published a method for fast zzso zzso and accurate zzso quality control for dynamic zzso zzso using a portal imaging zzso This method is in routine use for daily leaf motion zzso The purpose of the present study was to develop an equivalent procedure for zzso of zzso with segmented zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso procedure is based on zzso performed during 3- to zzso periods at zzso zzso and zzso zzso On each measurement day, images were acquired for a field consisting of five 3 zzso 22 zzso zzso These 10 monitor unit zzso segments were delivered in zzso mode, moving the leaves from left to zzso zzso of realized leaf gap zzso from the prescribed zzso were zzso to study the leaf positioning zzso To assess zzso in leaf zzso the sequential delivery of the zzso segments was also zzso A zzso 20 zzso 20 zzso field was delivered with zzso between 1 and 50 zzso to study the beam output and beam profile at low zzso Comparisons with an zzso chamber were made to verify the zzso dose zzso at low zzso Dedicated software was developed to improve the zzso ratio and to correct for image zzso 

The observed long-term leaf gap zzso (1 standard zzso was zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso and the zzso zzso In all cases the zzso was zzso Down to the lowest zzso beam output zzso performed with the zzso agreed within zzso zzso with zzso chamber zzso These findings led to a fast zzso zzso procedure for accurate, daily zzso quality control for zzso
