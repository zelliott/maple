zzso is an zzso of zzso zzso the first zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso administration of oral zzso with oral zzso not only increases the zzso of zzso zzso to elimination of zzso zzso but can change the route of elimination of zzso from zzso metabolism to zzso zzso An zzso study was performed to determine the effect of zzso impairment on the zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso 

zzso in the study were 17 patients with zzso solid zzso zzso performance status zzso age zzso years; 12 male, 5 zzso The patients were separated into two groups based upon zzso clearance zzso group A had zzso zzso function arbitrarily defined as zzso zzso zzso ( zzso and group B had moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso Treatment was separated into test and treatment zzso During the test period all patients received zzso 50 zzso orally on days 1-3 and zzso 10 zzso together with zzso zzso During the treatment period, all patients received zzso 50 zzso orally on days zzso with zzso at a standard dose of 20 zzso for those in group A or a dose individualized according to the zzso parameters in the test period for those in group zzso 

The clearance of both zzso and zzso was decreased in patients with zzso impairment compared to those with normal zzso zzso A linear relationship was observed between zzso zzso and zzso in patients with zzso zzso but not in those with normal zzso zzso zzso dose zzso on the basis of the test dose zzso data for the patients with zzso function zzso accurately resulted in drug exposure in the potentially therapeutic zzso zzso was not zzso 

zzso increases the oral zzso of zzso and results in a switch from zzso metabolism to zzso zzso A standard dose of this combination can be administered safely to patients with zzso zzso zzso The combination can also be given to patients with zzso impairment using a test dose and zzso zzso to predict the appropriate dose of zzso It is expected that sufficient information will be available from this and other studies to allow accurate prediction of the appropriate zzso dose modifications required in patients with zzso zzso
