In a cancer mortality study, the decision of whether to define a study outcome via underlying cause of death zzso or via multiple cause of death zzso information may impact relative risk zzso estimates and associated confidence zzso 

zzso equations are presented that relate zzso estimates obtained in a cancer zzso study to the zzso estimates obtained in mortality studies using zzso and zzso zzso Data from the zzso zzso and End zzso program were used to obtain information about the detection and confirmation rates of cancer diagnoses made via zzso Data from US cause of death data tapes were used to obtain information on the ratio of zzso to zzso listings for cancer zzso zzso examples illustrate the use of these zzso 

In our examples, the zzso obtained via analyses of zzso were close to those obtained via analyses of zzso (but of greater zzso even when assuming that the confirmation rate of cancer diagnoses made via zzso listing was substantially lower than that of diagnoses made via zzso 

These finding are supportive of the use of zzso information in cancer mortality zzso
