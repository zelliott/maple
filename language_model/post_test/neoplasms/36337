zzso is effective in the treatment of several zzso but is a known zzso resulting in shifts to hearing sensitivity in up to zzso of zzso zzso hearing shifts tend to occur first within an zzso of a patient's high frequency hearing limit, termed the sensitive range for zzso zzso and progress to lower zzso While it is currently not possible to know which patients will experience zzso without testing their hearing directly, monitoring the zzso provides an early indication of zzso A tool to help forecast zzso to zzso changes in the zzso in advance of each chemotherapy treatment visit may prove useful for zzso monitoring efforts, patient counseling, and therapeutic zzso 

This project was designed to zzso establish zzso risk zzso that zzso the probability that a new patient will suffer hearing loss within the zzso during treatment with zzso and zzso evaluate the accuracy of these predictions in an independent sample of Veterans receiving zzso for the treatment of zzso 

Two study samples were zzso The zzso sample contained 23 subjects while the zzso sample consisted of 12 zzso 

zzso curve predictions for zzso threshold shifts following zzso exposure were developed using a zzso sample comprised of data from a total of 155 treatment visits obtained in 45 ears of 23 zzso zzso thresholds were obtained within each zzso zzso at each treatment visit and compared with baseline zzso The risk of incurring an zzso shift was statistically modeled as a function of factors related to chemotherapy treatment zzso dose, radiation treatment, zzso zzso and patient status zzso zzso hearing, cancer location and zzso The model was reduced so that only statistically significant variables were zzso zzso characteristic zzso curve analyses were then used to determine the accuracy of the risk curve predictions in an independent zzso sample of observations from over 62 treatment visits obtained in 24 ears of 12 zzso 

Only cumulative zzso dose and zzso hearing were found to be significantly related to the risk for hearing zzso The zzso risk curve predictions developed from the zzso sample yielded area under the zzso curve accuracy estimates of zzso when applied to an independent zzso zzso 

zzso zzso dose in combination with zzso hearing provides an indication of whether hearing will shift in the zzso in advance of zzso zzso The validated zzso risk zzso described zzso can be used before and during treatment to anticipate hearing zzso While having such a tool would not replace serial hearing testing, it would be of great benefit to an zzso monitoring zzso It would promote relevant zzso zzso Furthermore, for those found to be at risk of zzso shifts within the speech zzso the zzso treatment plan could incorporate anticipated dosing adjustments that could stave off the impact that zzso might zzso
