The high-level expression of zzso receptors zzso on various tumor cells has provided the molecular basis for successful use of zzso zzso zzso as tumor zzso in nuclear zzso The vast majority of human tumors seem to zzso one or the other of 5 distinct zzso zzso zzso Whereas neuroendocrine tumors frequently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso frequently express zzso or zzso or both of these zzso In contrast to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds to zzso and 5 with high affinity zzso zzso to zzso with moderate affinity zzso zzso and does not bind to zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to bind to zzso 3, 4, and 5 with high zzso and to zzso with lower affinity zzso zzso Based on its unique zzso binding profile, zzso was suggested to be a potential zzso for tumor diagnosis, and zzso suitable for zzso zzso zzso When directly compared with zzso and zzso discrepancies in the zzso imaging pattern are seen in about one third of tumor patients concerning both the tumor zzso as well as the detection of tumor zzso On a molecular level, these discrepancies seem to be based on a higher zzso binding affinity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso results of zzso experimental zzso therapy were first reported for high-dose treatment with zzso based on the zzso of zzso zzso Phase zzso of the zzso Analysis of a Universal zzso Imaging and Treatment Initiative, a European Study zzso shows in progressive cancer patients zzso entry zzso with a calculated tumor dose zzso 10 zzso zzso the zzso for treating tumor patients with zzso zzso imaging zzso In the zzso study, cumulative treatment doses up to 232 zzso zzso were given as short-term intravenous zzso zzso treatment results in 154 patients indicate stable tumor disease in zzso zzso of zzso of patients and zzso tumor disease in zzso zzso of zzso of tumor patients with different tumor entities expressing zzso No severe acute or chronic zzso zzso change in zzso or liver function parameters caused by zzso treatment were reported for patients in the zzso zzso In two thirds of patients with neuroendocrine tumor zzso zzso showed a higher tumor zzso and should therefore be considered the first choice for experimental zzso zzso Potential indications for zzso treatment are zzso zzso cancer, zzso cancer, lung cancer, some brain tumors, and possibly zzso In conclusion, zzso data and clinical studies confirm the potential usefulness of zzso zzso for tumor diagnosis and zzso However, careful consideration of the type of zzso used for zzso therapy should be made for the individual zzso zzso zzso should always be performed to predict doses for tumors and the critical zzso which are kidney and bone zzso
