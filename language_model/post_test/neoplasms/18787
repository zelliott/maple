The financial and psychological impacts of cancer treatment on patients can be zzso zzso issues, such as zzso medical supplies and obtaining zzso zzso can impose financial strain on patients and their families, and this is often exacerbated by a simultaneous loss of income if a patient is unable to continue employment during treatment, or if family members become full-time zzso These financial difficulties are often more severe for patients from rural regions because cancer services tend to be concentrated in metropolitan areas, requiring rural patients to relocate or undertake lengthy, frequent commutes to access zzso The needs of rural cancer patients may differ from and exceed those of metropolitan cancer zzso Because of this, it is important to assess the needs of rural and metropolitan populations to develop appropriate, tailored zzso zzso This article compares the zzso zzso needs of zzso with metropolitan cancer patients in Western Australia zzso a large and sparsely populated Australian state with a substantial rural and remote zzso This article is part of a larger program of research assessing the zzso needs of zzso cancer zzso 

Participants were identified through the Western Australian Cancer zzso zzso and considered eligible if diagnosed with any type of cancer between 6 months and 2 years zzso A random sample of zzso potential participants was generated, structured to include all cancer types and geographical areas, and with both sexes zzso within these zzso Following confirmation and exclusion of deceased patients and those patients excluded at the treating doctor's request, zzso patients were zzso Participants were asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and the zzso Care zzso zzso Long Form zzso Data from participants who completed and returned both questionnaires were zzso using descriptive statistics and zzso tests; and any missing data were addressed through zzso 

Eight hundred and zzso participants zzso zzso completed the zzso and zzso zzso completed both zzso Of the zzso zzso 234 zzso were from rural areas and 169 zzso were from remote zzso Among the 15 items with the highest frequency for zzso zzso on the survey, participant needs did not vary by geographical location, with no significant differences found for any of the 15 zzso The item for which the zzso albeit zzso zzso zzso zzso difference was seen, was zzso about financial zzso The differences among all other items were not significant zzso from zzso to zzso Furthermore, the proportion of participants reporting zzso to high zzso on these items also did not differ significantly across geographical populations zzso from zzso to zzso 

The lack of zzso between zzso remote and metropolitan cancer patients' zzso needs provides a positive message regarding the state of zzso cancer services and the level of support provided to rural and remote zzso zzso Future research should also assess the zzso needs of rural and remote zzso and families in comparison with metropolitan zzso and families, to ensure that services are well-equipped to meet the needs of all individuals involved in a patient's cancer zzso
