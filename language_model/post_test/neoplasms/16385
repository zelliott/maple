The wealth of data in basic science and zzso research may often represent a conundrum for clinical zzso who need to selectively consider this abundant information and translate it into therapeutic zzso For the sake of zzso we have classified the zzso of genetic abnormalities in five zzso that are rapidly zzso and useful for zzso in clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso imbalance refers to zzso instability, which is a major feature of cancer, and innovative techniques used in zzso cancer should also be implemented in lung zzso zzso changes zzso in zzso zzso have been extensively studied in zzso cell lung zzso zzso techniques have shown that these zzso changes commonly occur at the same frequency in numerous zzso both well-known ( zzso zzso zzso ) and recently discovered ( zzso zzso ) in zzso cell lung cancer and in breast zzso Innovative techniques like quantitative zzso chain reaction can determine gene expression profiles, mainly zzso of zzso which may be related to resistance to specific zzso zzso In the near future, we hope these profiles can be used to zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso related to zzso of different genes can also be used to predict response to zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the assessment of zzso could enable us to understand their functional consequences in chemotherapy zzso
