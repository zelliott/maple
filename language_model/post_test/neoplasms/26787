The measurement and characterization of circulating tumor cells zzso hold promise for advancing personalized zzso zzso are the precursor to zzso cancer and thus have the potential to radically alter patient treatment and zzso Currently, clinical information provided by the zzso of zzso is limited to predicting clinical zzso Other areas of interest in advancing the practice of pathology include: using zzso for early detection of potential zzso determining and monitoring the efficacy of individualized treatment regimens, and predicting zzso zzso Important hurdles to overcome in obtaining this type of clinical information involve present limitations in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Currently, zzso are detected using zzso zzso The definition of what zzso a zzso should be expanded to include zzso with zzso zzso and markers should be identified to enable a more comprehensive zzso Additionally, most methods available for detecting zzso do not capture functionally viable zzso zzso functional viability would provide a significant advantage in characterizing zzso that may predict the site of zzso invasion and thus assist in selecting effective treatment zzso In this review we describe areas of clinical interest followed by a summary of current circulating zzso technologies and present zzso Lastly, we provide insight into what is required to overcome these limitations as they relate to applications in advancing the practice of pathology and laboratory zzso
