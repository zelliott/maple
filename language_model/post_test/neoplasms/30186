The capacity of any portion of the zzso zzso zzso to produce a complete functional zzso outgrowth upon transplantation to an zzso fat pad is unaffected by the age or zzso history of the zzso Likewise, through serial zzso no loss of potency is detected when compared to similar zzso of the youngest zzso tissue zzso This demonstrates that stem cell activity is maintained intact throughout the lifetime of the animal despite aging and the repeated expansion and depletion of the zzso zzso through multiple rounds of pregnancy, zzso and zzso These facts support the contention that zzso stem cells reside in protected tissue locales zzso where their zzso potency remains essentially unchanged through zzso zzso of the zzso to produce dispersed cells results in the zzso of the protection afforded by the zzso and leads to a reduced capacity of dispersed zzso cells (in terms of the number zzso to zzso complete functional zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate that during the zzso of zzso stem cell niches by dispersed zzso cells in the context of the intact zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, including mouse and human cancer cells, may be zzso and zzso to perform zzso zzso cell functions including those ascribed to zzso zzso zzso
