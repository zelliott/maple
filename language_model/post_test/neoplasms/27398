Solid tumors consist of a porous zzso and a zzso zzso composed of a network of zzso with highly permeable zzso Blood flows across the zzso from the zzso entrance point to the zzso exit point, and enters the tumor by zzso and zzso zzso through the permeable zzso zzso In this paper, an integrated theoretical model of the flow through the tumor is zzso The flow through the zzso is described by zzso law for an zzso porous zzso the flow along the zzso is described by zzso law, and the zzso flux is described by zzso law involving the pressure on either side of the zzso Given the zzso the zzso and the ambient pressure, the problem is formulated in terms of a coupled system of integral and differential equations for the vascular and zzso zzso The overall zzso is described in terms of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso flow rates whose functional form provides an explanation for the singular behavior of the vascular resistance observed in zzso zzso solutions are zzso for an idealized case where the zzso is modeled as a single tube, and charts of the zzso zzso are presented for a broad range of tissue and zzso wall zzso The results in the zzso range of conditions are found to be in good agreement with laboratory zzso It is shown that the assumption of uniform zzso pressure is not generally appropriate, and predictions of the zzso rate based on it may carry a significant amount of zzso
