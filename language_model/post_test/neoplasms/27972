We investigated the relationship between the zzso and zzso change in the tumor expression of the drug resistance gene zzso and the cellular injury response gene zzso and clinical response to zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso levels were measured by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in tumor samples obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy from 14 patients before and 24 h after zzso zzso 

There was no difference between zzso and zzso with respect to either the zzso zzso zzso level or the change in zzso zzso level at 24 h after treatment zzso zzso zzso Likewise, there was no difference in zzso zzso zzso level between zzso and zzso However, there was a significantly greater increase in zzso zzso at 24 h in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso level of zzso or higher predicted response with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

An increase in zzso zzso level reflects zzso damage sufficient to be manifest as a clinically zzso reduction in tumor zzso zzso of the change in zzso zzso level successfully identified patients destined to respond as early as 24 h zzso
