zzso to the pharmacological treatment of cancer is dependent on the expression levels of genes involved in mechanisms of zzso and on the existence of genetic zzso that may affect their zzso Thus, changes in genes zzso zzso carriers may account for considerable zzso zzso in drug zzso and the lack of sensitivity to the zzso of these zzso Moreover, changes in proteins involved in drug export can affect their zzso zzso and transport ability and hence may also modify the zzso of zzso zzso Regarding zzso zzso or drug zzso genetic zzso are responsible for changes in the activity of zzso zzso which affect drug clearance and may determine the lack of response to zzso zzso The presence of genetic zzso may also decrease the sensitivity to pharmacological agents acting through molecular targets or signaling zzso Recent investigations suggest that changes in genes involved in DNA repair may affect the response to zzso zzso Since most zzso agents activate cell death zzso the evasion of zzso plays an important role in zzso Several genetic zzso affecting zzso zzso the zzso pathway, downstream zzso and their natural zzso and the zzso pathway, whose elements are zzso in more than half of tumors, and survival zzso have been zzso The present review summarizes the available data regarding the role of genetic zzso in the different mechanisms of zzso and discusses their potential impact in clinical practice and in the development of tools to predict and overcome zzso
