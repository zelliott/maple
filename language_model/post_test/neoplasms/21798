zzso learning is used in a large number of zzso applications and zzso The application of machine learning techniques in other areas such as pattern recognition has resulted in accumulated experience as to correct and zzso approaches for their zzso The aim of this paper is to give an account of issues affecting the application of machine learning tools, focusing primarily on general aspects of feature and model zzso selection, rather than any single specific zzso These aspects are discussed in the context of published zzso studies in leading journals over the last 5 zzso We assess to what degree the experience gained by the pattern recognition research community pervades these zzso zzso We finally discuss various critical issues relating to zzso data sets and make a number of recommendations on the proper use of machine learning techniques for zzso research based upon previously published research on machine zzso
