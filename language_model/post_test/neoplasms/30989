The availability of engineered zzso species has zzso new developments in zzso This chapter summarized recent studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso which are minimal zzso binding sites engineered as single zzso zzso The zzso zzso can be as small as 26 zzso zzso or may be engineered as larger fusion proteins designed to zzso into zzso or zzso zzso They typically exhibit rapid clearance that results in high targeting specificity within a matter of zzso We have compared different modes of administration to allow further manipulation of their zzso and targeting zzso zzso of the present study comparing intravenous zzso and zzso zzso administration show comparable long-term retention in zzso but the zzso route showed an initially high peak blood level while zzso injection did zzso As with a single zzso dose, repeated zzso injections of zzso attained high zzso ratios, whereas continuous zzso infusion reached a steady state level of free zzso in blood and kidney that exceeded that in tumor zzso We observed improved zzso of zzso zzso in tumor zzso if the zzso label resisted zzso from the zzso which was accomplished, for example, through zzso of a zzso group to zzso zzso groups of the zzso zzso of the zzso by genetic incorporation of a zzso zzso (to form zzso provided a zzso site for zzso that simplified incorporation of zzso with the opportunity for improved diagnostic imaging in cancer and other zzso zzso applications of zzso zzso could rely on zzso zzso to zzso or zzso Engineering zzso of zzso with increased zzso affinity and appropriately manipulating their mode of administration should promote sustained tumor retention conducive to clinically useful therapeutic zzso
