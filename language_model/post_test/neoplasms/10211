Cancer stem cells zzso represent zzso cell zzso in zzso organized tumors, which are selectively capable of tumor initiation and zzso and give rise to bulk populations of zzso cancer cell progeny through zzso zzso evidence for the existence of zzso identifiable zzso among cancer bulk populations has been generated using zzso genetic lineage tracking of zzso defined cancer zzso in competitive tumor development zzso Moreover, novel mechanisms and relationships have been discovered that link zzso to cancer therapeutic resistance and clinical tumor zzso zzso zzso for the potential therapeutic utility of the zzso concept has recently been provided by demonstrating that selective killing of zzso through a prospective molecular marker can inhibit tumor zzso zzso we review these novel and zzso relevant research developments and discuss potential strategies for zzso therapy in the context of resistance mechanisms and molecular pathways zzso operative in zzso
