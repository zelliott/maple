The differential modifications which occur in certain cells and which lead to cellular diversification are believed to be controlled by changes in gene zzso Animals which are genetic mosaics can be used to investigate the origins and consequences of differential gene action in zzso The progress made with this experimental approach to the study of gene control of zzso is summarized and zzso and ideas are suggested for future zzso Major topics considered include: 1) initiation of differential gene activity in early development, 2) zzso and their zzso 3) zzso origins of zzso 4) nervous system and sensory zzso 5) zzso system, 6) sex zzso 7) immune system, 8) gene action in zzso zzso development, 9) liver zzso 10) zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso
