In the quest to reduce mortality and morbidity from cancer, there is continued effort to identify novel zzso to aid in the early detection and the accurate prediction of zzso zzso One group of proteins that is emerging as a potentially important group of markers in multiple zzso types is the zzso zzso This review zzso the biological and clinical relevance of these proteins in relation to different zzso zzso 

A literature search was performed using the zzso database and the reference lists of relevant zzso Single case studies were excluded and only reports with a clinical relevance from 1961 to 2007 were zzso 

The search yielded over 1000 published articles and zzso Important reports and studies were zzso screened and tracked for further relevant zzso Only the most relevant publications are discussed with relation to individual members of the zzso zzso 

There is increasing evidence that altered expression of zzso family members is seen in many zzso including breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate and oral zzso zzso proteins are commonly zzso in zzso and this is often associated with zzso zzso In contrast zzso zzso and zzso have been documented as zzso zzso in some zzso but as zzso promoters in zzso This demonstrates the complexity of the family and zzso of their zzso Although the precise roles of these proteins in cancer is still to be discovered many of the family are associated with promoting zzso through interactions with zzso zzso or by acting as zzso There is also evidence that some members can regulate zzso factors such as zzso zzso already has a role in a clinical setting in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of zzso zzso As our understanding of this family develops it is likely that many more members will aid the diagnosis, monitoring and potential treatment of zzso in the zzso
