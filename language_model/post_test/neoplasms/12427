There is still confusion in the choice of the molecular zzso to predict the radiation response of human zzso The case of zzso appears to be particularly complex, may be because of their instability and zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso the relationships between DNA zzso breaks zzso repair, zzso relaxation and cellular zzso zzso human zzso cell lines, representing a large spectrum of radiation responses and zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso with surviving fraction at 2 zzso zzso as an zzso Standard and modified zzso gel zzso techniques were employed to assess zzso repair rate and zzso zzso A zzso zzso was chosen to estimate zzso repair activity, independently of zzso zzso 

Surviving fraction at 2 zzso zzso decreases zzso with the amount of zzso zzso and the extent of zzso zzso one additional zzso zzso per cell or zzso zzso zzso produce a loss of about zzso surviving zzso However, all the cell lines did not obey both zzso suggesting that zzso repair and zzso zzso contribute separately to increase the severity of DNA damage involved in cell zzso Four cell lines groups showing different zzso repair and/or zzso zzso were zzso Cell lines exhibiting both zzso repair zzso and zzso relaxation are the most zzso
