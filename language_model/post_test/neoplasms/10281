zzso therapy zzso involves acquisition and processing of biomedical images to actively guide medical zzso The proliferation of zzso technologies has been particularly significant in zzso zzso zzso as a way to increase the tumor targeting zzso When zzso is applied to moving tumors, image guidance becomes challenging, as motion leads to increased zzso Different strategies may be applied to mitigate the effects of zzso each technique is related to a different technological effort and complexity in treatment planning and zzso The objective comparison of different motion zzso strategies can be achieved by zzso the residual uncertainties in tumor zzso to be detected by means of zzso zzso Such zzso requires an extension of targeting error theory to a zzso space, where the zzso tumor trajectory as a function of time measured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis can be represented by a motion probability density function, describing the statistical fluctuations of tumor zzso We illustrate the application of zzso analysis through examples, including weekly variations in tumor trajectory as detected by zzso respiratory gating via external surrogates and real-time tumor zzso
