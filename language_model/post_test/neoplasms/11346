zzso of zzso signal zzso networks contributes to multiple aspects of zzso Chemical genetic approaches interrogate zzso signaling in the immediate context of small zzso inhibitor zzso In recent years, such approaches have identified new zzso targets, clarified the impact of zzso zzso using agents for which at least one primary target is known, and have identified targets for which zzso zzso leads to improved zzso zzso of the mechanisms through which specific small zzso zzso agents impact crucial cancer pathways should yield important and clinically zzso insights into the use of similar agents in zzso
