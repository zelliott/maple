zzso is a small zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso that is undergoing clinical trials for treatment of zzso 

zzso was tested against the zzso in zzso panel using a zzso exposure zzso zzso zzso and in zzso using zzso weekly dosing for a planned 4 weeks at its maximum tolerated dose zzso of 180 zzso 

In zzso the median relative zzso value for zzso was zzso zzso Four cell lines with zzso values zzso 200 zzso included two ALL cell lines zzso and zzso an zzso cell line with an zzso zzso zzso zzso and a Ewing zzso cell line zzso In zzso zzso induced significant differences in zzso distribution compared to control in 12 of 29 zzso of the zzso solid tumor zzso and in 2 of 8 zzso of the zzso ALL zzso zzso differences in zzso distribution were most frequently noted in the zzso panel (6 of zzso A single solid tumor zzso zzso had a greater than twofold increase in time to event compared to control animals, with all other solid tumor zzso showing lesser degrees of tumor growth zzso zzso responses were not observed for either the solid tumor or ALL zzso 

zzso showed its most consistent activity in zzso against ALL cell lines and in zzso against zzso zzso However, no objective responses were observed in solid tumor or ALL zzso Further zzso work evaluating zzso in pediatric models in the combination therapy setting may contribute to its pediatric zzso
