The ability of zzso Iron zzso zzso zzso and zzso generation 5 zzso zzso zzso to zzso provoke zzso zzso was investigated in order to develop a targeted, zzso zzso delivery system for cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso coating and cancer specific targeting zzso zzso zzso have been incorporated into zzso zzso complexes to enhance serum stability and selective zzso by cancer zzso Such a modification of zzso zzso enhanced its zzso into cancer cells and increased the efficiency of targeted gene suppression in zzso Moreover, the developed zzso delivery system was capable of sufficiently enhancing in zzso zzso activity of an zzso drug zzso The proposed approach demonstrates potential for the creation of targeted zzso zzso platforms with the ability to deliver therapeutic zzso specifically to cancer cells in order to prevent severe adverse side effects on healthy zzso and in zzso monitoring of the therapeutic outcome using clinically relevant imaging zzso
