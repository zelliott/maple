zzso assessment of early zzso of zzso is still a problem of clinical zzso We studied whether zzso during zzso stress induced by zzso II zzso zzso allows earlier detection of left zzso impairment than echo at zzso We compared 30 zzso zzso to 30 patients with zzso who had received zzso at a cumulative dose of at least 360 zzso At rest zzso of patients were either normal zzso zzso zzso 24) or abnormal zzso zzso zzso 6; fractional zzso less than zzso distance of zzso zzso to zzso greater than 7 zzso Best zzso for separation of zzso vs N was the slope K of the zzso line of the relation between zzso diameter and zzso blood pressure zzso 38% of zzso and zzso of zzso had zzso below the range of N (less than zzso zzso zzso Four of five patients with reduced ejection fraction assessed by zzso (less than zzso after continued therapy with zzso have had, in previous zzso studies, normal resting parameters but abnormal zzso We conclude that zzso increases the sensitivity of zzso in detecting zzso due to zzso
