The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso play essential roles in control of cell cycle progression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso by zzso box O proteins such as zzso leads to growth arrest and zzso Previously, we observed that B cell zzso zzso zzso engagement of zzso 231 immature B zzso cells with an zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso growth arrest and zzso As zzso zzso expression in these cells prevented zzso induction of zzso and cell death, we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in multiple cell zzso The mechanism of this repression was explored using a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The studies demonstrate a functional association of zzso and zzso on a zzso zzso binding element in the zzso zzso This association involves the zzso box II domain of zzso and the zzso zzso portion of zzso Analysis of publicly available zzso zzso showed an inverse pattern of zzso and zzso zzso expression in primary acute zzso zzso prostate cancer and tongue zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso gene by the high zzso expression of zzso in many tumor cells likely contributes to their uncontrolled proliferation and invasive zzso
