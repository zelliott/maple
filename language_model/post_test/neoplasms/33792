zzso human peripheral blood zzso cells from healthy donors exhibited spontaneous zzso against zzso solid tumor targets in a 12- to 24-hr zzso release or zzso release zzso Both zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso and natural killer zzso zzso exhibited comparable levels of spontaneous zzso against fresh melanoma tumor zzso This zzso was observed under zzso zzso zzso zzso did not lyse the melanoma zzso Culture zzso of zzso incubated with the melanoma tumor cells did not exhibit zzso activity against these zzso zzso zzso lacked zzso activity against the zzso targets in a zzso zzso release zzso Treatment of the zzso with zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso plus complement did not reduce zzso zzso of the melanoma targets, demonstrating that zzso zzso cells, if any, were not responsible for the zzso of zzso melanoma targets by zzso In contrast, zzso 1 zzso zzso cells were responsible for the zzso of the melanoma targets by zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso into the zzso release zzso or zzso of zzso with zzso significantly increased their zzso against zzso solid tumor zzso zzso cultured for 3 days with medium alone lost their zzso zzso The addition of zzso from the beginning of these cultures prevented the loss of the zzso activity of zzso In zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit comparable levels of spontaneous zzso against fresh solid tumor zzso
