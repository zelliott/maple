zzso with high-risk types of human zzso zzso can cause the development of zzso zzso To study mechanisms responsible for immune escape of tumor cells infected with zzso we previously used mouse zzso zzso cells producing zzso E6 and zzso zzso to derive zzso clones resistant to zzso against zzso We have found zzso of the clones to correlate with the point zzso in the zzso zzso which resulted in the zzso substitution in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have shown that this zzso reduced stabilization of zzso molecules on zzso cells and eliminated zzso of zzso The resistance of zzso clones was zzso as zzso against E6 inhibited tumor zzso zzso of the zzso clone carrying the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso gene restored zzso to zzso against zzso Our results suggest that zzso of tumor zzso can lead to the escape of zzso cells and should be considered in the development and evaluation of cancer zzso
