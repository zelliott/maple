Many optical diagnostic approaches rely on changes in scattering and zzso properties to generate optical contrast between normal and diseased zzso Recently, there has been increasing interest in using zzso agents to enhance this intrinsic contrast with particular emphasis on the development for targeting specific molecular features of zzso Gold zzso are a class of zzso zzso with an extremely zzso peak optical resonance ranging from the zzso to the zzso zzso Using current zzso zzso of a wide variety of core and shell sizes can easily be zzso to scatter and/or absorb light with optical cross sections often several times larger than the geometric cross zzso Using gold zzso of different size and optical zzso we employ zzso Carlo models to predict the effect of varying zzso of zzso on tissue zzso The models demonstrate the importance of zzso from the zzso on zzso signals even when the optical extinction is dominated by zzso Furthermore, because of the strong optical response of zzso a considerable change in zzso is observed with only a very small concentration of zzso zzso the optical behavior of gold zzso in tissue will aid in developing zzso as contrast agents for optical zzso
