Cancer cell zzso resistance is a molecular signature that highly influences the outcome of chemotherapy treatment and for which there is currently no robust method to monitor in zzso its zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso and its oxidized form zzso affect the zzso state of cancer zzso Specifically, the interaction of zzso with the zzso couple zzso is shown in human zzso cervical cancer cells zzso and a zzso resistant zzso zzso the zzso resistant associated protein 1 zzso using zzso techniques, such as flow zzso and zzso zzso It is further demonstrated that the differential response to zzso in zzso cells is in part due to zzso unspecific zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the interaction between zzso and the cells, and the differential response was observed to depend on zzso zzso This newly established relation between zzso zzso and zzso resistance in human cancer cells enables than the acquisition of scanning zzso zzso zzso
