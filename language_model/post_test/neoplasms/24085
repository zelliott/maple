Rapid recovery of zzso T cells after intensive chemotherapy is limited by an zzso decline in zzso Here we sought to determine whether similar limitations exist for zzso zzso zzso After intensive chemotherapy, zzso T cells had a faster effective doubling time than zzso T cells zzso zzso v zzso days, P zzso zzso zzso at 3 months zzso mean zzso zzso number had returned to zzso whereas mean zzso zzso number was only zzso of zzso values zzso zzso zzso These differences were primarily due to very rapid expansion of zzso and zzso zzso At 3 months zzso there was no relationship between age and zzso zzso number (R zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso number was zzso related to age (R zzso zzso and there were no discernible differences in zzso recovery among patients with or without zzso enlargement, whereas zzso recovery was enhanced in patients with zzso enlargement after chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso Therefore zzso pathways of zzso zzso appear to rapidly zzso substantial numbers of zzso but not zzso T cells, resulting in prolonged zzso subset imbalance after zzso zzso These inherent distinctions between zzso v zzso zzso zzso may have significant implications for zzso strategies undertaken to eradicate minimal residual zzso disease after zzso zzso
