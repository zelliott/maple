Recent results obtained from research on the zzso metabolism of tumor cells have uncovered the zzso zzso that takes place upon zzso zzso Many features have been highlighted that are currently being exploited for specific zzso Many more will become available shortly as a consequence of the recognition of potentially useful targets for zzso General interest in this area can be zzso by the number of recent patents that have been zzso or are in the process of zzso Because the zzso zzso that is a hallmark of cancer cells involves a disruption of its zzso the regulatory pathways dealt with in this review were broadly divided into those that zzso the main stages of the cell cycle and its various regulatory mechanisms and those that involve the zzso zzso typical of cancer zzso It becomes apparent that both, the cell cycle and the zzso metabolism are interconnected and rely on reactions many of which are dependent on zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are responsive to cellular zzso signaling and may have a key role in determining whether cells progress towards zzso transformation as a result of continuous zzso zzso The results discussed here underline aspects of the signaling pathways that lend themselves to specific zzso by natural and synthetic zzso The zzso and its role in programmed cell death are briefly zzso but special emphasis is placed on zzso regulation at the level of zzso structure, particularly the reactions that involve zzso and zzso of zzso Within this context, zzso that act on zzso zzso are discussed as promising alternatives to available zzso
