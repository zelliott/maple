The human zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso family of heat shock zzso is a counterpart of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are expressed mainly in zzso zzso while transcripts of human zzso gene have been detected in various normal zzso zzso albeit translation of the zzso zzso into corresponding protein has not been yet zzso demonstrated, except for several cancer cell zzso The aim of our work, a first step in search for zzso function in cancer cells, was to establish its zzso zzso at zzso temperature and during heat zzso First, we used zzso and a highly specific zzso to select cell lines with the highest expression of the zzso zzso which turned out to be zzso and zzso lines originating from zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso was also detected by zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was studied using both the specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso of cells with fusion proteins zzso and zzso We found that, at zzso temperature, the zzso was localized primarily in zzso zzso during heat zzso zzso shifted to nucleus and zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that in zzso cells zzso accumulated in zzso Our results suggest that the zzso like zzso zzso can be involved in protecting zzso and zzso integrity in cancer cells subjected to heat shock and, zzso other cellular zzso
