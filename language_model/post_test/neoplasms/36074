There is resurgence within drug and zzso development communities for the use of primary zzso models as improved zzso of patient tumor response to novel therapeutic zzso Despite perceived advantages over cell line derived zzso models, there is limited data comparing the zzso and zzso of zzso to the donor patient zzso limiting the determination of molecular relevance of the zzso zzso This report directly compares the zzso characteristics of patient tumors and the derived zzso models, including gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Fresh tumor zzso from 182 cancer patients were implanted zzso into zzso mice for the development of primary patient zzso zzso zzso assessment was performed on both patient tumors and the resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso in key zzso and gene expression levels of resulting zzso were compared to the matched patient tumors using the zzso zzso San Diego, zzso and human gene zzso zzso Santa zzso zzso platforms zzso The zzso stability of the established zzso was assessed across serial in zzso generations in a representative subset of zzso The zzso of patient tumors that formed zzso were compared to those that did not to identify the possible molecular basis to successful zzso or zzso 

Fresh tumor zzso from 182 cancer patients were implanted into zzso mice with zzso zzso models that have been successfully established, exhibiting strong zzso and zzso zzso to the originating patient zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso between the zzso and the matched patient tumors were found to be stable across four zzso zzso Not only did the various tumors retain the differentiation pattern, but supporting zzso elements were zzso Those genes zzso specifically in zzso were enriched in biological pathways involved in host immune response, consistent with the immune zzso status of the zzso Patient tumors that successfully formed zzso were enriched for cell zzso cell cycle, and zzso pathways and exhibited evidence of reduced zzso 

The preservation of the patient's tumor zzso profile and tumor zzso supports the view that primary patient zzso provide a relevant model to support the translation of new therapeutic strategies and personalized medicine approaches in zzso
