Modern radiation therapy techniques are exceptionally flexible in the deposition of radiation dose in a target zzso Complex zzso of dose can be delivered zzso so that the tumor is exposed to a high dose, whereas nearby healthy structures can be zzso As a result, an increase in zzso dose is no longer invariably associated with an increased level of zzso This modern technology can be exploited further by modulating the required dose in space so as to match the variation in radiation sensitivity in the zzso This approach is called dose zzso For dose painting to be effective, functional imaging techniques are essential to identify regions in a tumor that require a higher zzso Several techniques are available in nuclear medicine and zzso In recent years, there has been a considerable research effort concerning the integration of magnetic resonance imaging zzso into the external zzso zzso motivated by the superior soft tissue contrast as compared to zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso reflects the cell density of tissue and thus may indicate regions with a higher tumor zzso Dynamic zzso zzso reflects zzso of the zzso and blood flow, correlated to the zzso of the zzso These properties have impact on its radiation zzso New questions must be addressed when these techniques are applied in radiation therapy: scanning in treatment position requires alternative solutions to the standard patient setup in the choice of receive coils compared to a diagnostic zzso This standard positioning also zzso repeated zzso The geometrical accuracy of MR images is critical for zzso zzso In particular, when zzso functional data are used for dose painting, zzso of functional parameters at a high spatial resolution becomes zzso In this review, we will address these issues and describe clinical developments in zzso dose zzso
