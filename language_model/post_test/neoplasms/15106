zzso produce multiple zzso factors, making it unlikely that agents targeting a single zzso zzso will be sufficient to treat the spectrum of tumors that occur zzso zzso zzso cell growth factor has zzso activity in zzso and in zzso and is zzso in most human zzso where its expression has been correlated with increased zzso density, more aggressive tumors, and poorer patient zzso zzso zzso cell growth factor is identical to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and unlike other zzso factors, the zzso actions of zzso are dependent on its zzso zzso 

A potent and specific zzso inhibitor of the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was tested for zzso and zzso activity in human cancer zzso in zzso 

zzso administration of zzso caused zzso to 50% reductions in the growth of zzso zzso cell lung cancer and zzso pancreatic cancer zzso but it was not active against a second pancreatic zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso density in the tumors, providing evidence for an zzso zzso Equal or better activity was seen when the mice were treated with the vascular zzso growth factor zzso a soluble zzso decoy zzso and the combination of zzso and zzso produced additive zzso activity that was significantly greater than the zzso zzso In the zzso tumors, the combination produced tumor zzso 

These studies show zzso activity for a drug targeting zzso and suggest that zzso of zzso could be used to augment the clinical efficacy of drugs targeting the zzso zzso
