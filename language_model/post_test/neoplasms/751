Most human genes undergo alternative zzso but zzso zzso forms are hallmarks of many zzso usually resulting from zzso initiating abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso or the introduction of a new zzso zzso We have identified a family of zzso zzso zzso of zzso (the zzso zzso 1 zzso in some B lineage zzso characterized by zzso skipping and/or partial zzso retention events that occur either together or independently in different zzso apparently due to zzso of inherited and acquired zzso Cellular, zzso and zzso properties of full-length zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are compared and zzso When zzso the properties of zzso are dominant over those of zzso zzso appears to be zzso expressed in the cell, but zzso are concentrated in the zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso de zzso zzso zzso Each of the zzso is able to zzso zzso protein from diffuse zzso locations to deeper zzso zzso This zzso zzso occurs through strong molecular zzso which also serve to protect zzso from its otherwise high turnover zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso interact with themselves and with each other to form zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be transforming in zzso and zzso in zzso when introduced as a single zzso to zzso zzso The altered distribution and zzso of zzso coupled with the characteristics of the zzso suggest possible mechanisms zzso the zzso zzso observed in human cancer may contribute to zzso and disease zzso
