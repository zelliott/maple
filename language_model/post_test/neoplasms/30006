There is increasing evidence that a variety of human zzso is maintained by a subset of cells, cancer stem cells zzso which sustain tumor growth, zzso its zzso behavior, and possibly initiate distant zzso The aim of this review is to evaluate the current evidence for the existence of zzso and the implications on the present management and treatment of solid zzso 

A retrospective review of the English-language literature zzso concerning zzso and their therapeutic implications was zzso 

zzso are characterized by two main properties of normal stem zzso zzso and zzso which are best zzso by serial transplantation experiments in zzso zzso zzso zzso that mark cell populations enriched for zzso have been identified in various solid zzso As such, the very existence of zzso has vast clinical implications with regard to cancer zzso The development of zzso zzso therapies (including therapies directed at these zzso surface zzso and reversal of the intrinsic resistance of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso great zzso However, normal stem cell toxicity and treatment resistance have been recognized as serious zzso 

The growing evidence indicating that zzso drive and maintain various types of solid human zzso has important implications for the treatment of zzso However, over the years the development of zzso therapies has faced a number of potential hurdles, which must be considered carefully in order to maximize the chance that such therapies will be zzso
