zzso volume has a profound influence on the dose required to control a given type of zzso The most obvious explanation for this is related to the larger number of stem cells which must be zzso leading to a more stringent requirement on cell zzso There are, however, other mechanisms by which volume may influence tumor control, such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso We investigate the question of whether the effect of volume on tumor control is, in general, predictable on the basis solely of the differing number of stem zzso 

We investigate whether the effect of volume on tumor control in four sites can be predicted, using the zzso zzso based on the assumption that the number of cells that must be zzso is directly zzso to the tumor zzso We require that the biological parameters in the model should have plausible zzso 

We find that the results of four clinical data sets, exhibiting a wide range of doses, volumes, and tumor control rates, are consistent with the hypothesis that the number of potential stem cells which must be zzso is zzso to the tumor zzso 

If these considerations are correct, the potential exists that realistic zzso dose corrections for tumor size could be routinely zzso This applies both to an entire treatment, and also between zzso as the tumor zzso Such an approach may contribute towards zzso zzso
