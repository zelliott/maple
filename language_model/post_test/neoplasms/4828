zzso treatment guidelines recommend low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso This analysis assessed the zzso treatment strategies for zzso in patients with advanced solid zzso 

Using administrative data from advanced zzso zzso zzso or breast cancer patients diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2007 at four zzso with integrated delivery systems, patients with an zzso or zzso zzso diagnosed within 2 years after cancer diagnosis and an zzso purchase of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso within 7 days of the zzso diagnosis were zzso zzso zzso zzso pharmacological treatment and factors independently associated with zzso of zzso zzso were zzso 

Overall, zzso of the zzso eligible patients received zzso zzso as primary zzso zzso The percentage increased steadily over time from zzso among patients diagnosed in 2000 to zzso among those diagnosed in zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso included zzso diagnosis year, chemotherapy within 60 days prior to zzso diagnosis, history of zzso prior to cancer diagnosis, and invasive surgery in the 90 days following zzso zzso zzso and prostate cancer patients versus lung cancer patients and stage III versus stage IV patients were less likely to be treated with zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso as initial treatment for zzso zzso was low but increased steadily over the study zzso Future studies should explore reasons underlying the zzso of this preferred evidence-based treatment as well as the comparative effectiveness of zzso versus zzso zzso in real-world cancer patients with zzso
