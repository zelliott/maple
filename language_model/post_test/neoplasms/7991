zzso is an zzso family zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso genes and contribute to the zzso zzso of cancer cells by inducing invasive and zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso growth factor zzso zzso which indicates that zzso would participate in cell zzso by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso to induce cell cycle arrest when cells are exposed to zzso zzso zzso are frequently observed in Ewing's zzso and we have revealed that zzso zzso protein activates zzso activity by zzso zzso However, substitution zzso binding site zzso zzso did not affect the responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso showed that the complexes contained zzso bound to the zzso promoter, which suggested that zzso functions as a zzso for zzso zzso Our findings that zzso acts as a zzso zzso may imply that the zzso zzso is regulated by the interaction of zzso zzso
