zzso zzso zzso zzso in brown zzso tissue zzso may generate zzso scan zzso Recent studies have shown reduced zzso zzso in BAT in rats treated with high doses of the zzso zzso The aim of this zzso study was to present a cohort of patients with high zzso zzso in BAT who underwent a second scan after receiving a low dose of zzso to determine whether the use of this zzso could improve the diagnostic confidence of zzso scans by zzso zzso zzso in zzso and also whether administration of this drug affects zzso zzso in zzso 

Twenty-six cancer patients, presenting with increased BAT zzso zzso were selected zzso On a different day, patients were given zzso 20 zzso orally 60 minutes prior to zzso administration zzso zzso zzso zzso and were scanned zzso zzso and zzso BAT zzso and tumor zzso (when zzso were zzso 

Mean zzso BAT zzso was zzso Mean zzso zzso was zzso zzso In 11 patients, the zzso mean tumor zzso was zzso and zzso in zzso scans zzso Nine patients showed zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso affecting image zzso This was not observed in zzso zzso No adverse effects due to zzso were zzso 

In this patient zzso there was significant reduction of zzso zzso in BAT following zzso administration, allowing for adequate interpretation of zzso and zzso zzso with CT images, particularly in the zzso area, without affecting tumor zzso zzso
