zzso is a mixture of zzso zzso which function as zzso binding to DNA and producing single and double strand breaks by the formation of an activated oxygen zzso zzso is an effective agent against a few human zzso notably zzso zzso and zzso germ cell zzso and certain zzso zzso Most human zzso are resistant to zzso a zzso however, and those which are initially sensitive frequently develop resistance to the drug during zzso Several potential modes of resistance to zzso have been identified in cell culture and animal zzso models, although their relative importance in determining the responsiveness of human zzso to the drug is not well zzso zzso is selectively toxic to cells in the M and zzso zzso of the cell cycle, and generally more effective against actively dividing rather than resting zzso Thus, the zzso state of the zzso cell population is an important zzso of drug zzso zzso is an essential zzso for zzso action, with the degree of zzso directly related to ambient zzso Both acutely and chronically hypoxic cells form a substantial fraction of the cell population of many zzso and may serve as a zzso of cells resistant to zzso on this zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a mechanism of resistance to the drug in some cells and may influence toxicity in normal zzso zzso zzso activity is low in lungs and skin, the two major sites of normal tissue zzso and levels of this zzso have been elevated in some but not all zzso cell lines selected for resistance to zzso The capacity to repair or withstand single and double strand DNA breaks may also be an important zzso of resistance to the zzso Most zzso and zzso cell zzso which are hypersensitive to zzso radiation because of defects in DNA repair, are also more sensitive to zzso than zzso zzso A number of agents which interact with zzso or inhibit DNA repair, such as ethanol, zzso zzso and caffeine, have been reported to sensitize cells to zzso in zzso
