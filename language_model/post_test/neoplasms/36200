The development of zzso zzso zzso aimed for a rapid treatment of breakthrough pain zzso in cancer zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was well characterized in healthy subjects, while zzso investigations in cancer patients are zzso 

The objective was to develop a population zzso model for zzso in volunteers and patients following zzso administration, to evaluate the influence of potential zzso and to simulate the exposure of zzso after repeated dosing in cancer zzso 

zzso data from ten clinical trials were used for model zzso The final model was validated with zzso zzso and visual zzso zzso In addition, the secondary zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso of a separate validation data set of zzso were predicted and compared to zzso analysis zzso zzso repeated dose zzso profiles in cancer patients were zzso 

Plasma profiles after zzso administration were best described by a zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships were identified for zzso and zzso zzso zzso of body weight, zzso sex and cancer patient as subject type were considered not to be clinically zzso zzso parameters for zzso of cancer patients were zzso Steady state simulations revealed that an extension from the current zzso scenario to 6 pain episodes per day would yield similar zzso zzso 

A robust population zzso model for zzso was zzso The model enhances the understanding of zzso zzso after zzso dosing in cancer patients with zzso a population for whom real-life data would be very hard to zzso
