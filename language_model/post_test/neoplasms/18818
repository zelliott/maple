Increased use of zzso sparing surgery has revealed a small but significant percentage of benign zzso zzso imaging techniques have aided in diagnosis, but are still unable to differentiate benign from zzso zzso We sought to evaluate whether the zzso zzso flow pattern could predict the presence of zzso cell cancer zzso 

Standard zzso ultrasound zzso and Power zzso ultrasound zzso were performed on 40 patients referred to our clinic for suspicious zzso masses diagnosed by CT or zzso from December 2007 to May zzso zzso findings were used to zzso tumors according to vascular patterns as proposed by zzso et zzso where pattern 0, 1, or 2 are considered diagnostic of benign zzso zzso while patterns 3 and 4 predict zzso Clinical and pathological data were zzso ultrasound findings were correlated with zzso 

Of the 40 patients included for analysis, 13 underwent active zzso 24 underwent partial or radical zzso and 3 underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had pathological specimens available for review, of which 22 patients had zzso and 5 had benign zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reliability were reasonable, but ratings didn't correlate with zzso outcomes (all zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso may not be helpful in the diagnosis of zzso zzso masses detected by CT or zzso Further studies are needed to zzso a zzso tool useful in diagnosing zzso in zzso zzso
