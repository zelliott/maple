The purpose of this chapter is to investigate as many of the zzso genes as possible in relation to their importance in cancer zzso For example, within the zzso zzso zzso there are genes whose protein product is solely responsible for the zzso of specific zzso For a number of these zzso although genetic zzso have not been identified, defined zzso zzso have been demonstrated in specific zzso Other examples are given in which functional zzso zzso have been zzso yet pertinent experiments for the determination of cancer risk have not been zzso The status of work relating to the genes in question is summarized and areas demanding future study are zzso
