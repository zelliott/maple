zzso and zzso are zzso agents with clinical zzso activity in a broad range of zzso solid zzso Because of zzso zzso unique mechanisms of action and resistance, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso combinations are attractive for testing in clinical zzso Prior weekly zzso and zzso regimens administered on a zzso cycle have been limited by cumulative zzso toxicity on day 15, thus reducing the planned zzso dose zzso We therefore conducted a phase I trial of a zzso schedule of weekly zzso and zzso to determine the zzso maximum tolerated dose zzso and preliminary estimates of efficacy of this zzso 

zzso patients with advanced zzso solid tumors were zzso zzso was given at a fixed dose of 1000 zzso while zzso was administered at an initial dose of 60 zzso then escalated by 15 zzso increments over seven dose levels to a zzso planned maximum dose of 150 zzso Both agents were infused zzso on days one and eight every 21 zzso At least three patients were enrolled per dose zzso No zzso dose escalation was zzso 

All patients were zzso for toxicity and 31 were zzso for zzso The regimen was generally zzso zzso zzso was observed in one patient at a zzso dose of 135 zzso zzso level zzso After expansion of this dose level by 14 additional patients, no further zzso zzso were observed although one patient at dose level seven died of zzso zzso after completing three zzso There were eight partial zzso for an overall response proportion of zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso Twelve patients zzso had stable zzso 

This zzso schedule of zzso and zzso is safe, zzso and zzso The recommended phase II dose is zzso 1000 zzso and zzso 150 zzso on days one and eight every 21 zzso The zzso activity observed with this regimen warrants further zzso
