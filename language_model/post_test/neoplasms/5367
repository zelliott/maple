The improvement of tumor control rates and improved survival times of zzso patients result in an increasing importance of radiation side effects in normal zzso 

zzso for the zzso of normal tissue reaction by stimulation of tissue zzso or by interference with general zzso pathways which are not specific for radiation damage, are illustrated by a number of zzso 

zzso knowledge about the zzso of normal tissue radiation responses are expected to significantly improve the efficacy of zzso means and possibilities for conservative management of side effects of radiation zzso Novel approaches may be developed if the so-called zzso radiation zzso is taken into consideration in addition to the cellular effects of zzso
