A central aspect of cellular systems biology is the study of zzso zzso driven by network control of molecular zzso zzso are produced in zzso bursts and, although time averaging zzso their accumulated levels, variation in their copy number is substantial in members of environmental sensing and zzso zzso We have developed a zzso zzso zzso capture chip platform called the MAC zzso to zzso precisely the copy numbers of many proteins from a single cell in a zzso single zzso zzso We intend to investigate protein noise in circulating zzso cells zzso isolated from zzso of cancer patients through the identification of zzso signatures, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso which correlate with biological properties and clinical outcomes during zzso
