zzso resonance imaging zzso of the apparent rate of water diffusion in tumors are sensitive to variations in tissue zzso which have been shown useful for characterizing tumors and their responses to zzso However, because of technical limitations on most zzso systems, conventional pulse zzso spin echo zzso methods measure relatively long time zzso during which water molecules may encounter diffusion barriers at multiple spatial zzso including those much greater than typical cell zzso As such they cannot distinguish changes on zzso scales from gross changes in cell zzso zzso zzso spin echo zzso methods have the potential to distinguish effects on restriction at much shorter time and length zzso Both zzso and zzso methods have been studied zzso by simulating diffusion in a zzso zzso tissue zzso The results show that conventional zzso with the zzso method cannot selectively probe variations over short length scales and, therefore, are relatively insensitive to zzso structure, whereas results using zzso methods at moderate zzso zzso are affected by variations in cell nuclear sizes and can distinguish zzso that differ only over zzso length zzso This additional sensitivity suggests that zzso imaging may have significant advantages over conventional zzso methods for characterizing zzso
