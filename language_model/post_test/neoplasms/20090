To investigate the zzso of zzso in inflammatory zzso disease zzso patients and the potential zzso role of zzso 

We performed an zzso descriptive study comparing the zzso of zzso in zzso patients treated with zzso and patients not treated with these zzso We included zzso patients which were divided in two groups depending on whether they have received zzso or zzso We have studied zzso characteristics of both groups (age when the disease was zzso sex, type of zzso zzso and treatments received zzso zzso zzso zzso or other zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed with the student zzso test, zzso test or zzso exact test as zzso A zzso zzso analysis was performed as zzso zzso zzso significance was establish at P values of less than zzso and zzso were used for the odds zzso 

Among zzso patients included, zzso zzso have received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both zzso zzso of patients treated with zzso and 46, zzso of patients who did not receive this treatment were women zzso zzso zzso The proportion of zzso colitis patients treated with zzso was zzso compare to zzso zzso of patients not treated zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean usage time was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the accumulated dose along this time was zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso With respect to zzso mean dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean usage time of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the accumulated dose along this time was zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was tested in zzso of patients treated with zzso among which zzso had an intermediate or high zzso Among the patients treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso received treatment with zzso and zzso respectively, but only zzso (7 zzso and zzso (3 zzso received these drugs in the group of patients who did not received zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso (29 zzso among those treated with zzso have received other zzso zzso zzso zzso compare to zzso (4 zzso of patients not treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Among patients treated with zzso zzso developed a zzso and among those not treated zzso presented in zzso zzso zzso zzso The most frequent zzso were zzso ones (12 cases in patients not treated with zzso but none in treated, P zzso zzso followed by zzso skin cancer (8 patients in treated with zzso and 6 in not treated, P zzso zzso 

In our experience, zzso therapy did not increase zzso development in zzso patients, and was an effective and safe treatment for these zzso
