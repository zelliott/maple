The term magic bullet was first coined by zzso Paul zzso in the late 1800s to describe a chemical with the ability to specifically target zzso while sparing normal host zzso His concept was later expanded to include treatments for cancer, but it is only in recent decades, with development and improvements in zzso zzso zzso technology, that the full therapeutic implications of zzso zzso strategies have been zzso zzso on the success of zzso linking the specificity of two zzso into a single agent, called a zzso zzso zzso allows for targeting of a therapeutic biological agent or cell to specific tissue zzso zzso zzso have been used for several decades to redirect zzso T cells or other zzso cells to kill tumor zzso Here, we review zzso models and ongoing phase I clinical trials in which arming zzso activated T cells with zzso may provide zzso activity without zzso zzso Additionally, we review findings from this novel strategy that zzso magic bullet technology with zzso stem cells to repair injured zzso zzso stem cells with zzso directed at zzso zzso enhances specific zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and may significantly improve cardiac function, strongly suggesting new zzso for zzso applications in tissue zzso
