The present paper deals with the problem of existence of equilibrium solutions of equations describing the general population dynamics at the microscopic level of modified zzso equation zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso jump zzso We show the existence of zzso equilibrium solutions and discuss zzso The conditions guaranteeing uniqueness or zzso are proposed under the assumption of periodic zzso
