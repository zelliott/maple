Nuclear workers, oil well zzso zzso air flight zzso and frequent fliers can be exposed to low doses of zzso but the long-term human health consequences of zzso exposure are zzso While few of these exposed populations are suitable for studying the effects of zzso exposure, patients treated with zzso therapy might be a source of zzso To assess the feasibility of conducting a zzso international study of the late effects of zzso therapy, we surveyed 23 cancer centers that had used zzso beam zzso For the 17 responding institutions, only zzso of the patients treated with zzso zzso of zzso were alive more than 2 years after zzso In a zzso zzso pilot study of 484 zzso cancer patients, we assessed the feasibility of obtaining zzso records, cancer zzso and other follow-up data, and of zzso patient organ zzso Patients were treated with 42 zzso zzso between 1972 and zzso zzso a clinical zzso factor of zzso for zzso total average organ doses outside the treatment beam ranged from zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso to zzso zzso for breast, zzso to zzso zzso for zzso and zzso to zzso zzso for active bone zzso depending upon the primary cancer treatment zzso We successfully traced zzso of the patients, but we found that patient survival was poor and that chemotherapy was not zzso in a quarter of the zzso Based on our findings from the international survey and the feasibility study, we conclude that a large investigation could detect a fivefold or higher leukemia risk, but would be inadequate to evaluate the risk of solid zzso with long zzso periods and therefore would likely not be zzso with respect to zzso cancer risk in zzso
