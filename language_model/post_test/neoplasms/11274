The advent of gene targeting has allowed the dissection of many essential cellular zzso including those involved in cell cycle regulation, signal zzso and zzso However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the simple gene deletion strategy may not be sufficient for the modeling of many cancer zzso In this Prospect article, we will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of mouse models, how they have advanced from gene deletions to zzso point zzso and conditional mouse models in which expression or loss of the gene of interest is controlled either temporally or zzso We will also consider future directions for the use of mouse models in zzso The vastness of the field zzso focusing on a few specific examples with the unfortunate exclusion of many excellent studies from our zzso As such, we focus on a few specific models of human cancer zzso however many of the themes discussed here are zzso to other systems of genetic manipulation and may be applied across zzso
