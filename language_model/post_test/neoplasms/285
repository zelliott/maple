This study has evaluated insulin resistance under zzso conditions using the zzso clamp zzso zzso clamp investigations were conducted at 4-5 different insulin levels zzso zzso in five zzso cancer patients, four zzso zzso Care Unit patients zzso and 11 zzso zzso Whole body zzso of zzso was zzso In three cancer patients the flux of zzso across the leg was zzso Cancer patients had significantly reduced zzso insulin zzso while zzso patients had increased levels compared to zzso The zzso levels of zzso did not differ among the zzso Both insulin sensitivity and responsiveness were reduced by 50% in cancer and zzso zzso At insulin levels of zzso zzso approximately zzso of the whole body zzso zzso could be accounted for by the peripheral zzso This study confirms that insulin resistance is a significant zzso zzso in cancer associated zzso The results demonstrate both decreased insulin sensitivity and zzso
