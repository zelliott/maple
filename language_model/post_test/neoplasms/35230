Natural killer zzso cells are important zzso of resistance against tumor growth and zzso zzso cell zzso is regulated by a balance of signals from zzso and zzso zzso While zzso against tumor cells is zzso it is essential that zzso cells do not attack normal zzso The distinction between tumor cells and normal cells is partly made at the level of zzso zzso transformation often results in induction of zzso for such zzso In addition, zzso cells discriminate self from zzso using zzso class zzso zzso zzso Host zzso class I molecules regulate development of zzso cell zzso and zzso a process that is not well zzso Recent data suggest that functional maturation may not be a zzso zzso quantitative aspects, with regards to zzso and frequency in interactions between developing zzso cells and normal cells, may be important for the generation of zzso cells that are zzso to zzso sensing the absence of zzso class zzso In this article, we discuss models for development of zzso cell zzso and zzso Our understanding of this process may have significant implications for the use of zzso cells in cancer zzso
