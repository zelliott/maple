An expanding body of evidence indicates that zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso will be an important strategy for preventing cancer because zzso catalyze the formation of zzso zzso and zzso have multiple effects that favor zzso zzso also are more abundant in zzso than in the normal zzso from which zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso and increases the zzso of tumor zzso zzso of Cox zzso zzso are zzso and zzso is inhibited in zzso knockout zzso We focus in this review on strategies to selectively inhibit and zzso the zzso zzso This is important because simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which is achieved with classical zzso interferes with the zzso functions of zzso and thereby causes serious side effects, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso hence is not a realistic approach for zzso in individuals at low to moderate risk for zzso On the other hand, it appears possible to avoid many zzso side effects by selective zzso of zzso which is also the zzso that is zzso in benign and zzso zzso Through understanding the zzso of these zzso and the regulation of zzso and zzso gene zzso we review how zzso can be regulated selectively as a target for zzso zzso We also discuss the potential importance and advantages of a multifaceted approach to diminishing the function of zzso zzso combining zzso of zzso function with zzso of gene zzso
