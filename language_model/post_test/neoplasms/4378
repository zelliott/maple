For many years, zzso have been examined as means to deliver zzso proteins to kill target cells zzso More recently, there have been studies on zzso that convert zzso to active drugs to kill target zzso The advances in gene therapy strategies now allow one to deliver the gene for the protein or zzso as an zzso This technique, although in its zzso promises to overcome some of the problems associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are some of the zzso currently being exploited in this way, but more are on the zzso However, more research is still needed to enable full exploitation of the zzso differences between zzso and normal cells so that more existing zzso can be treated in this zzso
