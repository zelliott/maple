Even after a tumor is established, it can early on enter a state of dormancy marked by balanced cell proliferation and cell zzso zzso to this equilibrium may affect cancer risk, as they may cause the eventual lifetime clinical presentation of a tumor that might otherwise have remained zzso Previously, we showed that cell death, zzso and migration can play a role in shifting this zzso making the understanding of their combined influence on tumor development zzso We developed an individual zzso computer model of the interaction of cancer stem cells and their zzso progeny to study early tumor zzso zzso of tumor growth show that three basic components of tumor zzso zzso migration, and zzso in unexpected ways to control tumor progression and, thus, clinical cancer zzso We show that increased proliferation capacity in zzso tumor cells and limited cell migration overall lead to space constraints that inhibit proliferation and tumor zzso By contrast, increasing the rate of cell death produces the expected tumor size reduction in the short term, but results ultimately in paradoxical accelerated long-term growth zzso to the liberation of cancer stem cells and formation of zzso
