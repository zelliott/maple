zzso including zzso carbon zzso zzso strongly absorb zzso zzso radiation and efficiently convert absorbed energy to released heat which can be used for localized zzso zzso We demonstrate for the first time that zzso increases heat zzso following zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso can be used to safely eradicate a tumor mass in zzso Upon zzso of zzso zzso heat is generated with a linear dependence on zzso time and laser zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in the concentration of zzso required to impart a 10 degrees C temperature increase in bulk solution zzso A single treatment consisting of zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso of a 500 zzso zzso followed by laser zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso completely eradicated zzso zzso tumors in zzso zzso of nude zzso zzso that received only zzso injection or laser zzso showed growth rates indistinguishable from zzso control zzso zzso zzso displayed no long-term damage from zzso The results demonstrate that zzso zzso are more efficient at converting zzso zzso into heat compared to zzso zzso and that zzso zzso can be used safely and effectively for the selective zzso zzso of zzso tissue in zzso
