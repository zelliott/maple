zzso therapy is a new type of therapy technology, there are zzso and high intensity focused ultrasound surgery zzso Compared with a single frequency system, zzso frequency system has an additional function to combine power patterns of different zzso This function increases the availability of power patterns to treat tumors of various shapes and zzso zzso we have in this article proposed a system with the ability to drive zzso phased zzso of multiple resonant zzso for ultrasound zzso and zzso The results show that this system is able to zzso drive zzso zzso or phased zzso of a single resonant frequency through the zzso power zzso zzso zzso drive zzso with different resonant zzso zzso adjust the relative phase and output power of each channel for the scanning zzso focus, and zzso operate each channel with good output zzso
