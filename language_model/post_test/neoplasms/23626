Both clinical and laboratory evidence indicate that local control rates for many experimental and clinical human tumors decrease with zzso of the overall duration of radiation zzso A likely basis for this is tumor cell zzso during zzso Such observations have zzso interest in tumor zzso and a number of techniques have evolved to increase the potential for meaningful clinical study of the zzso behavior of zzso This review discusses the clinical and experimental evidence for proliferation during treatment, describes two potential zzso zzso and zzso of zzso could be employed in attempting to overcome such zzso zzso explores both past and zzso evolving methods available for measuring tumor zzso and discusses how such kinetic information could be used in the future to tailor therapy to a zzso individual zzso
