We report here that the application of the least square method of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso rate changes in time and space, as tested with either the zzso or the zzso tumor pairs for each of 15 tumor entities, has revealed the presence of zzso linkage that was conditioning the changes of two cancer risk parameters to let them fit to the equilibrium model with close resemblance to the chemical equilibrium zzso The zzso of the cancer risk equilibrium model to the chemical equilibrium zzso zzso between the equilibrium model of zzso force zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso force zzso zzso zzso discussed in the light of the concept of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The proposed network hypothesis of human zzso found supporting evidence in the corresponding changes of the statistical features of human zzso with and without sex discrimination of cancer zzso
