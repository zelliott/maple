zzso selective reactions were explored to zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso zzso zzso To generate zzso groups, zzso zzso was zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso groups were then generated upon the zzso of the protecting zzso group from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with zzso M zzso in the presence of 1 zzso zzso at pH zzso The major focus was on zzso the reaction zzso zzso ratios, and reaction pH to zzso high levels of zzso to zzso without causing the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso reactions of zzso (15 zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso excess to the zzso followed by the reaction of the zzso product zzso with zzso at pH zzso afforded zzso zzso with zzso high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso using zzso and with zzso using the zzso method showed zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso When injected zzso to nude mice with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso accumulated rapidly and was retained in the tumor for a 44 h period while the zzso cleared rapidly from the blood, thereby resulting in increasing zzso ratios over zzso The tumor zzso was similar between the zzso label and the zzso label for a 44 h zzso In contrast, the blood zzso was lower, but liver and other organ zzso were much higher for the zzso label than for the zzso The zzso label produced higher zzso ratios but much lower zzso ratios than the zzso The rapid blood zzso a short peak tumor zzso time, and a low peak tumor zzso value with prolonged tumor retention of this zzso appear to support a hypothesis that zzso primarily binds to zzso receptors on zzso vessels, but not on the zzso This hypothesis was substantiated by the zzso microscopic analysis of zzso which showed that zzso outlined zzso but not tumor cells at 4 and 21 h ex zzso Additional proof was observed when blood vessels outlined with zzso which specifically binds to blood vessels, were zzso on zzso outlined with zzso
