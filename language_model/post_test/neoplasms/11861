A unifying concept that appears to provide an understanding of cancer as a fundamental scientific problem is zzso This concept, which was initially developed on the basis of experiments using the relatively uncomplicated plant tumor systems, now appears zzso to animal and human tumors as zzso Evidence is provided to show that the tumor problem is fundamentally a problem of anomalous cellular differentiation and that the zzso cellular change that zzso the zzso state is similar to that which zzso cell specialization occurring during the normal course of development in all higher zzso Both cellular differentiation and zzso depend for their expression on the persistent zzso of select but, in part, different genes zzso normal, foreign, or zzso present in the zzso of a zzso Since zzso cellular changes of this kind may be induced by physical, chemical, and biological agents of the most diverse type, and since cells may remain zzso during the time that they exhibit the tumor zzso the results reported here suggest that whether the normal or tumor zzso is expressed is determined by how the genetic information present in a cell is regulated in the zzso zzso leading to the establishment and maintenance of the zzso state may be accomplished in different ways by the different types of zzso zzso Thus cancer and related zzso diseases appear to have a common underlying zzso cellular change in which the diverse manifestations of the zzso state commonly observed would simply reflect different expressions of this zzso cellular zzso
