Genome scale expression profiling of human tumor samples is likely to yield improved cancer treatment zzso However, identification of clinically zzso or zzso zzso can be challenging when a large number of genes are measured in a small number of zzso 

We describe an zzso method to extract zzso consistent zzso from multiple analogous data zzso We applied this method to expression profiles from five zzso negative breast zzso zzso (not expressing zzso or zzso zzso and derived four zzso We assessed these zzso in four similar but independent zzso and found strong associations between three of the zzso and zzso response to zzso zzso Furthermore, we applied the method to zzso and early stage lung cancer, two tumor types that lack reliable zzso of outcome, and found that the zzso yield zzso of survival for zzso 

These results suggest that the use of multiple data sets to derive potential zzso can filter out data zzso noise and can increase the efficiency in identifying clinically accurate zzso
