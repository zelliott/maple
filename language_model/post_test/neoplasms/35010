When 125 patients with generalized zzso were followed up for 6 years, zzso reported continuing zzso In four patients a zzso had been identified at the time of the initial examination, and four other patients developed zzso during the follow-up zzso Seven of the patients died of the zzso during the follow-up zzso This zzso of zzso does not differ significantly from the value expected in a general population, matched for age and zzso However, two of the zzso were zzso and this zzso is significantly zzso less than zzso higher than that expected in a similarly matched zzso As a whole our study indicates that no significant overall increase of zzso zzso is to be expected in patients with generalized zzso and, therefore, any general efforts for cancer follow-up screening seem zzso in patients with zzso
