zzso zzso of cells, termed zzso are of interest for studying tumor behavior and for evaluating the response of zzso active zzso zzso more faithfully reproduce the tumor zzso found in zzso compared to classical zzso zzso We present a method for embedding zzso within collagen gels followed by quantitative and qualitative whole zzso and single cell analyses enabling characterization over the length scales from molecular to zzso zzso producing and embedding capabilities are demonstrated for zzso and zzso cell lines, of zzso and breast zzso origin, zzso Finally, using the zzso tumor model, the zzso response between zzso delivery as a zzso dose, as practiced in the clinic, is compared to delivery within an zzso zzso The zzso zzso delivery route provides a superior outcome and the results mirror those observed in a zzso zzso zzso These findings highlight the synergistic beneficial results that may arise from the use of a drug delivery system, and the need to evaluate both drug candidates and delivery systems in the research and zzso screening zzso of a new cancer therapy development zzso
