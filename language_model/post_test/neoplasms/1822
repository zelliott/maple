zzso Quality of Life assessment is widely used in clinical research, but rarely in clinical zzso zzso including practical difficulties administering printed questionnaires have limited their zzso zzso technology could reduce these barriers and encourage better zzso interaction regarding patient symptoms and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to develop a new system for zzso patients' zzso outcomes using mobile phones or the zzso and to test whether patients can and will use the system via a mobile zzso 

We have developed a zzso of a Wireless Health Outcomes Monitoring System, which allows structured questionnaires to be sent to the patient by their medical management zzso The patients' answers are directly sent to an zzso zzso immediately accessible by the medical team, and are displayed in a graphic format that highlights the patient's state of zzso In the present study, 97 cancer zzso were asked to complete a zzso zzso The questionnaire was delivered by display on a mobile phone, and was answered by the patients using the mobile phone zzso 

Of the 97 patients, 56 zzso attempted the zzso and all of these 56 completed zzso Only zzso of the total number of questions were left unanswered by zzso zzso zzso patients refused to participate, mostly due to their lack of familiarity with mobile phone zzso Compared with those who completed the zzso patients who refused to participate were older, had fewer years of education and were less familiar with new communications technology zzso phone calls, mobile phone zzso zzso zzso 

More than half of the patients zzso the questionnaire using the mobile zzso This proportion may increase with the use of zzso communications which can be incorporated into the zzso The proportion may also increase if the patient's partner and/or family were able to assist the patient with using the zzso These preliminary results encourage further studies to identify specific diseases or circumstances where this system could be useful in patients' distance zzso Such a system is likely to detect patient suffering earlier, and to activate a well-timed zzso
