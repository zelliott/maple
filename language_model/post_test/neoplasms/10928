zzso and zzso instability are major characteristics of human zzso These abnormalities can result from defects in the zzso assembly checkpoint zzso which is a surveillance mechanism for accurate zzso segregation through restraint of the activity of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso regulator that promotes zzso checkpoint zzso and releases zzso from checkpoint zzso zzso is zzso by zzso during zzso zzso of zzso causes a zzso delay of the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso an zzso of zzso and promotes the release of zzso from zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso causes earlier zzso of zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso is highly expressed in many types of zzso These results suggest that zzso is a key regulator of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso might contribute to zzso development by causing zzso zzso
