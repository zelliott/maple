Analysis of genetic zzso may help identify putative zzso markers and determine the biological basis of variable prognosis in zzso However, in contrast to other variables commonly used in the zzso studies, there are special considerations when studying genetic zzso For example, variable inheritance patterns zzso dominant, zzso and additive genetic zzso need to be explored to identify the specific zzso associated with the zzso In addition, several characteristics of genetic zzso such as their minor zzso frequency and linkage zzso among multiple zzso and the population zzso of the cohort investigated need to be accounted for in the zzso In addition, in cancer research due to the zzso differences between the tumor and zzso DNA, differences in the genetic information obtained using these zzso need to be carefully assessed in zzso zzso In this article, we review these and other considerations specific to genetic zzso by focusing on genetic zzso studies in zzso
