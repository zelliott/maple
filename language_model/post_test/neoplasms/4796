Since initial zzso the zzso clinical trial database has expanded zzso with a doubling of patients exposed in the clinical trial zzso Previous pooled data zzso from phase I to III studies of zzso showed a zzso imbalance in zzso arising in zzso recipients zzso compared with control subjects zzso The previous analysis was based on limited available data, zzso further zzso 

We sought to examine the zzso of zzso using comprehensive pooled data from clinical trials of zzso zzso 

This pooled analysis included data from 67 phase I to IV clinical zzso The zzso primary analysis assessed the zzso of primary zzso in 32 randomized, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

There were zzso unique patients in all clinical trials zzso received zzso The primary analysis identified zzso in 25 patients zzso zzso 14 in zzso zzso patients and 11 in zzso zzso zzso zzso rates per 1,000 zzso of observation time for zzso and zzso patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the corresponding rate ratio was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were of varying zzso type and occurred in a number of different organ zzso no cluster of zzso was zzso 

In this pooled analysis no association was observed between zzso treatment and risk of zzso in zzso zzso the rate ratio was below zzso The data suggest that a zzso relationship between zzso therapy and zzso is zzso
