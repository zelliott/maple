To investigate the population zzso of zzso in patients with advanced solid zzso and to identify patient zzso contributing to the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso 

Patient zzso and zzso data were collected from patients receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso during the early clinical trials of zzso Data were fitted using zzso mixed effects zzso to generate population mean estimates for clearance zzso and central volume of distribution zzso The relationship between individual estimates of the zzso parameters and patient zzso was examined and the influence of significant zzso on the population zzso estimates and their zzso was investigated using zzso multiple linear zzso The performance of the developed model was tested using an independent validation zzso All patient data were pooled in the total cohort to refine the population zzso model for zzso 

zzso zzso model was used to fit the zzso data of zzso zzso zzso clearance zzso was found to influence significantly the zzso of zzso and explained zzso of zzso in this zzso whilst body weight zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso prediction zzso prediction error zzso zzso g zzso and root mean square prediction error zzso zzso g zzso of the observed zzso zzso was obtained in the model validation zzso The final population mean estimates were zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso parameters was reduced zzso zzso V zzso when influential zzso were included in the final zzso The following zzso relationships with zzso parameters were described by the final population model: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso and V zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A population zzso model has been developed for zzso in patients with advanced zzso zzso parameters of zzso are markedly influenced by the patient's zzso function, body weight and serum zzso levels, which may be taken into account in dose zzso The use of influential zzso to guide zzso dosage selection may result in less zzso in drug exposure and potentially a better clinical zzso
