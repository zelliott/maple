An intact immune system likely contributes to the outcome of treatment and may be important for clearance of drug-resistant tumor cells and for prevention of zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso in melanoma patients, which is linked to immune suppression, results in an initial response rate, these responses are typically of limited zzso Combining zzso drugs with zzso agents is an attractive strategy to increase clinical zzso Evidence suggesting that zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in tumor cells contributes to immune suppression suggests that the two approaches may be zzso provided that zzso zzso are nontoxic to immune zzso 

To assess effects of zzso zzso zzso on systemic zzso we studied 13 patients with tumors carrying a zzso zzso who underwent treatment with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso We carried out peripheral blood zzso before and following one or two zzso cycles of zzso 

zzso treatment had no zzso impact on most immune parameters tested, including serum zzso levels, peripheral blood cell counts, zzso subset zzso and memory zzso and zzso zzso recall zzso A slight increase in serum zzso over the course of treatment was zzso In addition, three of the four human zzso zzso patients experienced a modest increase in circulating tumor zzso zzso T cells following zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso treatment results in no zzso negative impact on existing systemic immunity or the de zzso generation of zzso T zzso These findings suggest that future trials combining specific zzso zzso with zzso should not impair immune zzso
