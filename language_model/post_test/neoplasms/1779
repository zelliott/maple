Cancer is a major public health concern in American Indian and Alaska Native zzso zzso However, information on the zzso of cancer is lacking for this zzso The purpose of this study is to report cancer zzso patterns for the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso annual cancer zzso rates for 1992 through 1999 were calculated for 12 zzso zzso and End zzso zzso areas, representing a sample zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Trends in cancer zzso rates for the zzso sample were determined using standard linear zzso of zzso rates and were compared to those of the zzso white zzso 

The top five incident zzso (from highest to zzso among zzso males were zzso lung and zzso colon and zzso kidney and zzso zzso and stomach zzso Among zzso women, zzso of the breast, colon and zzso lung and zzso zzso and zzso ranked zzso Four sites where cancer zzso rates are greater for zzso than for whites include gallbladder (the zzso rate was zzso times the rate for white males and zzso times the rate for white zzso liver and zzso zzso duct zzso zzso times for males and zzso times for zzso stomach zzso times for males and zzso times for zzso and kidney and zzso pelvis zzso times for males and zzso times for zzso The data show increasing trends for zzso males and females and declining trends for white males and females for zzso stomach, and pancreatic zzso and zzso Similar differences between zzso rates and white rates were found for urinary zzso zzso in males and gallbladder cancer in zzso 

Analysis of zzso data allowed for the determination of disparities in cancer zzso between a sample of the zzso zzso population and the white zzso The findings of this study provide baseline information necessary for developing cancer prevention and intervention strategies specific to the zzso population to address these cancer zzso
