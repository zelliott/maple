zzso zzso patients represent a cohort of individuals uniquely at risk of complications from zzso yet less likely to respond to the zzso It is not yet clear how to best protect this vulnerable zzso 

We performed a prospective analysis of 177 pediatric zzso patients to define the zzso of influenza vaccine zzso Each variable was examined over three time points and a repeated measure analysis was zzso 

Patients with ALL vaccinated during induction phase had superior influenza vaccine responses than those subjects vaccinated during zzso or maintenance zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso zzso responses were associated with a higher baseline zzso count zzso and higher zzso and zzso zzso zzso responses, suggesting prior zzso exposure is a significant zzso The solid tumor cohort had equivalent responses during all time frames of zzso 

The optimal protection from influenza of pediatric patients on chemotherapy should include zzso but it is clear that not all patients produce high zzso of zzso after zzso This study identified zzso that could be used to zzso vaccine zzso zzso zzso might have a role in targeting resources, as zzso counts predicted of vaccine responses among the patients with zzso
