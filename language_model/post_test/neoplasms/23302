Cancer is a zzso condition that involves genetic and zzso events culminating in zzso zzso zzso in zzso events that regulate the zzso activity of genes associated with various signaling pathways can influence multiple stages of zzso In cancer cells, an imbalance often exists between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities, and current research focuses actively on seeking competitive zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso are proving useful for cancer prevention and therapy by virtue of their ability to reactivate the expression of zzso silenced zzso including those involved in zzso cell cycle regulation, zzso zzso invasion, and zzso Furthermore, zzso studies suggest that different diets such as intake of zzso vegetables may lower the risk of different zzso and there is growing interest in identifying the specific zzso constituents and zzso insights of their zzso Interestingly, it has been observed that cancer cells are more sensitive than zzso cells to zzso induction by some zzso Although the zzso basis for this sensitivity is zzso yet zzso have emerged as important zzso target for single and zzso zzso zzso derived from diverse sources such as zzso zzso and synthetic increase zzso level of cells and bring about zzso and zzso effects specific to cancer cells by way of their role in cell cycle regulation and expression of zzso silenced zzso
