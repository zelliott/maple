Lack of annual population estimates for zzso Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific zzso zzso populations limits the ability to examine cancer zzso rates and trends to understand the cancer burdens among zzso 

zzso 1990 and 2000 population census data, we estimated the annual populations by age and sex for Native zzso zzso and zzso for zzso in regions covered by 13 of the National Cancer Institute's zzso zzso Cancer diagnoses during zzso from these zzso were used to calculate the zzso (2000 US zzso zzso rates by sex, calendar zzso and cancer type for each zzso The annual percentage change zzso in zzso rates was estimated with the zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso calculated for both the rate and zzso zzso 

zzso significant declining trends were found in Native zzso in men for lung and stomach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso respectively), and in women for breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso since 1998 and lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso since zzso Rising zzso trends were experienced by zzso especially by zzso women for breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso With limited data, zzso demonstrated lower, but zzso zzso rates than other zzso 

zzso cancer zzso rates for zzso zzso populations help identify disparities in cancer burden and provide valuable information to improve cancer control efforts among zzso
