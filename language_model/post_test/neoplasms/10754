zzso zzso molecules are zzso proteins that belong to the zzso zzso In addition to their zzso in close proximity to the tight junctions in zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso molecules are also expressed in circulating cells that do not form zzso such as zzso and zzso As a consequence, these proteins are associated not only with the zzso barrier function of the tight zzso but also with other zzso zzso such as inflammatory zzso responses to vascular injury, and tumor zzso Furthermore, because of their zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules are poised both for receiving zzso from the cell interior zzso zzso zzso and function being regulated in response to inflammatory zzso and growth zzso and for translating zzso adhesive events into functional zzso This review focuses on the different roles of zzso zzso molecules in normal and zzso conditions, with emphasis on inflammatory reactions and vascular responses to zzso
