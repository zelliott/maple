One form of zzso against cancer development involves a series of genes whose role is to metabolize and zzso potentially toxic compounds and to repair subtle mistakes in zzso Much laboratory and zzso research over the past decade has concentrated on the identification of these genes and an assessment of their role in cancer zzso Of particular interest has been whether the risk of cancer associated with a particular environmental exposure differs with respect to functionally different zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso A large number of studies have been conducted for numerous genes and also for all common cancer sites, although results have been very inconsistent and therefore zzso This is partially due to the inadequate sample size of most studies to detect modest effects and the zzso of positive associations identified in zzso of the zzso There is also much confusion about the meaning of zzso zzso what type of studies should be conducted to study it and also how it should be zzso Furthermore, the very purpose of these studies is not clear; are they attempting to identify high-risk individuals, or are they simply trying to further understand the cancer zzso This review will explore these questions and provide some recommendations to help ensure that the next phase of zzso interaction studies, which are likely to be much larger and based on many more zzso also provide some clearer zzso
