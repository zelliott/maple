A cell zzso many genetic and zzso changes as it transitions to zzso zzso transformation is also accompanied by a progressive loss of tissue zzso and zzso in tissue architecture that ultimately culminates in tumor cell invasion into the zzso and zzso to distant organ zzso Increasingly, cancer biologists have begun to recognize that a critical component of this transformation journey involves marked zzso in the mechanical zzso of the cell and its surrounding zzso These mechanical differences include modifications in cell and tissue structure, zzso zzso changes in the environment, altered processing of zzso cues zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we review critical steps in this zzso zzso including mechanical contributions to tissue zzso invasion of the zzso and zzso We discuss the zzso basis of this force journey and present recent advances in the measurement of cellular mechanical properties in zzso and in zzso We end by describing examples of molecular mechanisms through which tumor cells sense, process and respond to mechanical forces in their zzso While our understanding of the mechanical components of tumor growth, survival and zzso remains in its zzso considerable work has already yielded valuable insight into the molecular basis of zzso tumor zzso which offers new directions in cancer zzso
