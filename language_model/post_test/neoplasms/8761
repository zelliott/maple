zzso zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso and zzso proteins that have been shown to act through its zzso zzso to regulate zzso growth cone guidance, zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso is also zzso by some zzso and plays a role in zzso zzso similar to vascular zzso growth factor zzso a protein that has been targeted as part of some cancer zzso In an attempt to examine the different effects on tumor growth and zzso for these two zzso factors, we previously noted that while zzso of both zzso and zzso restricted tumor zzso and size, vessels forming under conditions of zzso blockade retained their association with zzso while those arising in a background of zzso zzso did not, an intriguing finding considering that zzso in zzso association with zzso cells is an emerging aspect of zzso intervention in the treatment of zzso Here we show through array analysis, zzso migration and zzso zzso and zzso zzso that zzso production by head and neck zzso tumor cells zzso expression of zzso growth zzso and zzso protein 4 from zzso cells in a zzso manner, thereby influencing proliferation and differentiation of zzso and vascular zzso whereas zzso lacks these zzso These results partly explain the differences observed between zzso and zzso in pathological zzso and suggest that targeting zzso function along with zzso could represent a novel zzso therapeutic strategy for the treatment of solid zzso
