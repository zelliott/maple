DNA repair capacity zzso plays an important role in genetic zzso to zzso zzso of a number of DNA repair genes involved in several distinct pathways have been zzso However, their effects on repair function have not been well zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso for removal of zzso zzso zzso DNA damage measured by a zzso zzso zzso was modulated by two zzso zzso in lung zzso In this report, we investigated the association between the repair zzso of ultraviolet zzso damage and zzso of three DNA repair zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso repair zzso and zzso zzso in base zzso repair zzso We measured zzso for removal of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso from 102 healthy zzso white zzso We also typed these subjects for five zzso in these three DNA repair genes (at zzso 9 of zzso zzso 6, 10 and 23 of zzso and zzso 10 of zzso Compared with zzso zzso subjects zzso for zzso of the two zzso genes consistently had zzso zzso The zzso was consistently lower in subjects zzso for zzso zzso or both than in subjects with other zzso although the difference was not statistically significant for zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso had no consistent effect on zzso We concluded that these zzso zzso may zzso zzso and may be useful zzso for identifying individuals at risk of developing zzso
