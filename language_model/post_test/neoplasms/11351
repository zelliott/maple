Controlled regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation is essential for embryonic development and requires the coordinated regulation of zzso zzso and gene zzso The zzso repeat protein zzso is an important zzso of both zzso zzso acts in the zzso signaling pathway, zzso the zzso of crucial target genes responsible for cellular proliferation and zzso zzso also controls zzso cell zzso at the plasma membrane and mediates the interplay of zzso junction molecules with the zzso zzso Both functions of zzso are zzso in human zzso thereby leading both to the loss of zzso zzso and to the increased zzso of zzso target zzso
