Vitamin D zzso zzso zzso are associated with a variety of diseases, which may translate into an effect on zzso 

To investigate the associations between zzso gene zzso and mortality among older zzso 

The analyses were conducted in a zzso prospective cohort of the zzso Aging Study zzso zzso DNA analysis was performed in zzso men and women zzso zzso We aimed to assess the associations between mortality and the zzso zzso zzso three zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and three zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

During the median follow-up of zzso years, zzso participants deceased zzso zzso for the zzso zzso 1 zzso was associated with a zzso higher mortality risk compared to the absence of zzso zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso Adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and zzso D levels did not affect this zzso The number of copies of the zzso zzso 1 zzso was zzso although not significantly, with an increased risk of zzso fractures zzso zzso HR, zzso zzso 1 copy zzso zzso and 2 copies zzso zzso After adjustment for zzso fractures, zzso for the zzso zzso 1 zzso was no longer associated with higher mortality risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso 1 zzso was related to increased mortality risk, which may be partly explained by zzso zzso As the biological mechanism is uncertain and this study size is zzso our results should be interpreted as hypothesis zzso
