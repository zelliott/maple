zzso and inflammation are central processes through which the tumor zzso influences tumor zzso We have demonstrated recently that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the host leads to overt inflammation that suppresses zzso via excess production of zzso zzso and prevents tumor zzso zzso we speculated that zzso zzso of zzso would promote tumor zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed primary tumor growth in zzso This effect was not zzso by zzso zzso mechanisms but by the zzso of zzso and inflammation in the host zzso Although zzso tumors were still susceptible to zzso absence of zzso in the host animal zzso the potent zzso effect of zzso In addition, zzso suppressed zzso cell proliferation and zzso production, increased zzso and zzso and inhibited zzso zzso Thus, both genetic zzso of zzso as well as its zzso by zzso cause tumor suppression via overlapping zzso zzso These findings reveal the potential utility of the well tolerated zzso zzso beyond their use as zzso drugs in zzso zzso Our results provide a zzso rationale for evaluating the clinical benefits of zzso zzso in cancer treatment, alone and in combination with other zzso
