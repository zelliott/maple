We present an analysis of a zzso model of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso This analysis addresses the contribution of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the overall zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis is based upon a zzso of a zzso zzso approximation of the solution of the corresponding master zzso We predict that zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso cells zzso of zzso vessels leads to an increased sensitivity of the zzso to low zzso of zzso thus zzso the zzso with increased resistance to zzso zzso
