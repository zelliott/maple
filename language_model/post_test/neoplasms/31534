To assess clinical usefulness of an zzso blood cell zzso in peripheral blood stem cell zzso collection and zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso System zzso was used to collect zzso zzso zzso in 17 zzso The mean processing blood volume and the mean zzso yield were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso cells exceeded zzso of the peripheral zzso more than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be collected by a single zzso Eight patients underwent zzso transplantation after high-dose zzso zzso recovery was achieved in a median period of 10 zzso 

zzso A zzso zzso machine has sufficient capability to collect zzso zzso The percentage of zzso cells in the peripheral zzso is a good predictor of the zzso cell yield of the zzso
