The differentiation stage of tumors is a central aspect in the zzso zzso of solid zzso The differentiation stage is strongly associated with tumor behavior, and generally an immature tumor is more aggressive than the more differentiated zzso While this is common knowledge in surgical pathology, the contribution of zzso gene expression and functions to tumor behavior is often overlooked in the zzso tumor biological zzso The mechanisms by which tumor cell differentiation stages are zzso or affected are poorly explored but have recently come into focus with the zzso the tumor stem cell zzso While zzso biologists view the differentiation as a zzso event, zzso and tumor biologists have introduced the concept of zzso to explain zzso changes occurring in solid zzso In this review we discuss the impact of the tumor cell differentiation stage as used in surgical zzso We further discuss knowledge gained from exploring the molecular basis of the differentiation and zzso processes in zzso and breast cancer, two tumor forms where the tumor cell differentiation concept is used in the clinical diagnostic work and where the tumor stem cell theory has been zzso
