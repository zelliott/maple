The relationships between zzso parameters of unchanged zzso zzso and several markers for zzso after zzso infusion zzso zzso over 2 and 4 h were zzso in patients with various zzso zzso stomach and colon zzso and zzso zzso 

Plasma and urinary levels of unchanged zzso were measured using a specific zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso parameters were calculated according to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso blood zzso nitrogen zzso serum zzso zzso plasma and urinary zzso zzso and zzso urinary zzso zzso and zzso clearance zzso were monitored for 30 days following zzso zzso 

The maximum plasma concentration zzso maximum urinary zzso rate zzso area under the plasma zzso curve from time zero to zzso zzso cumulative amount zzso in urine from time zero to zzso zzso total clearance zzso zzso clearance zzso and plasma zzso zzso of unchanged zzso were not significantly different between the zzso and zzso infusion zzso The values of the zzso markers changed significantly following zzso administration, suggesting that zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso caused zzso The zzso of unchanged zzso was the most zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was related to maximum zzso maximum zzso and minimum zzso levels in 27 zzso treatments according to an exponential zzso 

In order to attain more effective zzso chemotherapy with minimum zzso the present zzso and zzso studies suggest that the zzso or zzso plasma level of unchanged zzso should be maintained between zzso and 2 zzso in a standard continuous infusion schedule over 2 h and 4 zzso
