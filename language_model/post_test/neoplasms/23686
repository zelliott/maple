zzso are the sites of zzso of the zzso zzso They contain may copies of the genes for the main zzso zzso and 28 zzso in the form of zzso arranged repeats at the zzso zzso organizer regions zzso They also contain the small zzso zzso that is zzso outside the zzso specific zzso zzso among them the factors and zzso necessary for zzso and transcript processing, and the precursor units of the zzso In man as in may zzso species, three main components of zzso besides zzso can be zzso zzso zzso zzso dense zzso component zzso and zzso component zzso Within a zzso the zzso are in many cases situated in its central zzso The zzso forms a network of strands surrounding the zzso but may sometimes reach for out towards the periphery of the zzso The zzso is usually situated in the peripheral regions of the zzso In cells with a low level of zzso zzso the zzso are small, usually with a single zzso and little surrounding zzso and zzso zzso zzso In active cells the zzso forms a large network enclosing zzso sometimes up to hundreds of zzso and the zzso covers a large area in the periphery zzso zzso In cells at the onset of a new zzso the zzso is very prominent whereas the zzso are few and small, and the zzso is also not very extensive zzso zzso In some special cell types that are very active other arrangements of the structural components are zzso In zzso cells, for instance, only one zzso is found, or occasionally two, each with a single large zzso and a distinct area of zzso both areas being engulfed by zzso zzso with some peripheral zzso zzso and in zzso zzso studies to zzso the zzso genes within the zzso have so far led to divergent zzso Both zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso have been claimed as the most probable zzso zzso of zzso and the subsequent early steps of zzso zzso are localized in the zzso whereas later steps zzso zzso zzso are localized in the zzso The zzso may also serve as sites for the preparation of the zzso for transcription, and as a store for certain zzso zzso During zzso parts of the zzso proteins remain at the zzso A direct contact between the zzso and the nuclear envelope is frequently observed but is not dependent on zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
