A zzso model using different properties for the pathological tissue and the normal tissue was developed to describe the spatial zzso temperature and zzso damage zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso distribution was simulated using the zzso Carlo zzso The optical tissue parameters and the blood zzso were derived based on the zzso rate process zzso of zzso damage and zzso of zzso The corresponding temperature distribution was zzso calculated using the zzso zzso zzso The calculated results showed that the zzso model predicted different results on the temperature variation and distribution, the zzso damage distribution and the zzso damage volume zzso from the zzso zzso As a more reasonable physical model, the zzso model can be used to zzso the therapeutic parameters for improved zzso zzso
