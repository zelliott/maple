We compared the levels of tissue factor zzso zzso in zzso with plasma zzso zzso of patients in zzso state caused by various zzso zzso zzso analysis showed absence of zzso zzso expression on zzso and zzso in healthy subjects but strong expression in both cell types of patients with zzso zzso levels in zzso were low in healthy subjects but they were significantly elevated in patients with underlying diseases of zzso zzso zzso zzso especially in acute zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso were significantly high in patients with all diseases except those with zzso and plasma zzso zzso levels were significantly high in all zzso zzso zzso in zzso and plasma zzso zzso levels were significantly high in patients with zzso and zzso zzso ratio was significantly high in patients with zzso In patients with solid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio were significantly higher in patients with zzso than those zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso and plasma levels of zzso zzso did not correlate in normal subjects and all patients, but they tended to be correlated in patients with zzso infections or zzso Our analysis suggests that zzso expression in zzso plays an important role in various diseases but the expression level does not always correlate with plasma levels of zzso zzso
