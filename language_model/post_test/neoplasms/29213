zzso zzso manifest their cellular functions by regulating expression of target genes known collectively as zzso genes zzso The zzso of zzso vary slightly between cell types, but routinely include a core of common zzso robustly zzso in most zzso zzso Here, we review the regulation and cellular functions of 2 related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that are commonly induced by zzso in most, if not all, zzso zzso On the basis of sequence zzso they are grouped together within the newly defined zzso zzso Emerging data on zzso and zzso suggest that both are zzso proteins with opposing activities on zzso that may influence the innate immune responses of zzso The zzso gene encodes a low molecular weight zzso protein that may stabilize zzso function and oppose zzso In contrast, zzso expression may sensitize cells to zzso stimuli via zzso membrane zzso On the basis of these results and differences in induction zzso between zzso and zzso we have proposed a model for the role of these genes in zzso cellular activity of zzso
