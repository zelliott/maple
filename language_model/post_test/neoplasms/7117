Patients with zzso have a zzso increase in the risk of developing a zzso zzso and a zzso increase in risk of zzso Both zzso zzso and vitamin K zzso zzso have been used for treatment of zzso zzso However, the best zzso approach remains a matter of zzso 

In adult patients with cancer and an acute zzso zzso event we sought to determine the rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso and major zzso when treated with prolonged zzso therapy compared to zzso zzso 

A systematic literature search strategy was used to identify potential trials on zzso zzso the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso assessment of bias of zzso controlled trials zzso was performed according to the Cochrane zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso The primary outcome measure was symptomatic zzso recurrence rate during the zzso zzso Relative risk zzso was used as the primary measurement with zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso zzso were calculated using random zzso and zzso zzso 

Five articles met our inclusion zzso All compared zzso and zzso for secondary prevention of zzso The pooled zzso of zzso recurrence was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The pooled zzso of major bleeding was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Minor bleeding events and all cause mortality were similar between the 2 intervention zzso 

The results of our review suggest that the long term use of zzso after the acute first week of treatment is superior to zzso for secondary prevention of zzso zzso in adult patients with zzso
