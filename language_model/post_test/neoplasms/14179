A zzso zzso mode has been established by using the interaction between platinum zzso drugs and DNA as input signal and the zzso zzso change of quantum dots zzso as output zzso The zzso zzso can be zzso by platinum zzso drugs via zzso electron transfer process, rendering the system into zzso zzso status, and the system can then be zzso zzso when zzso is restored due to zzso zzso between DNA and platinum zzso zzso This zzso zzso change realized the detection of zzso and DNA, overcoming the selectivity problem commonly existed in the traditional zzso zzso detection zzso The zzso fluorescent zzso zzso mode has been further employed to study the interactions between DNA and different platinum zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the impacts of different types of zzso zzso in base zzso chain length and zzso on the mode are also zzso This simple, fast and convenient zzso method owns promising applications in the study on interaction between medical molecules and DNA, and in zzso zzso
