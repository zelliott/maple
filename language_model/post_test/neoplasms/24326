Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and is generally viewed as a potential target for stem cell zzso Although several studies have reported the generation of zzso zzso zzso from embryonic stem zzso cells, it is unknown whether the zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be isolated in zzso To investigate this possibility, we have developed a combined approach in which zzso cells are zzso with zzso zzso cells to expose them to zzso zzso inducing activity zzso and are then cultured as zzso Mouse zzso cell colonies were detached from zzso zzso cells after 8 days of zzso treatment and then expanded as spheres for another 4 days in zzso medium supplemented with zzso growth zzso The spheres exhibited neural stem cell characteristics and contained few zzso zzso at this stage of zzso After being induced to differentiate on zzso dishes for 7 days, these spheres generated zzso zzso in zzso at a relatively low zzso zzso addition of zzso cell zzso medium to the sphere culture medium significantly increased the percentage of zzso zzso to zzso of the total number of zzso zzso of zzso zzso day 4 zzso which contained zzso zzso zzso into the mouse zzso resulted in the generation of a significant number of zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso of zzso zzso are generated and can zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced by serial zzso and zzso zzso medium zzso
