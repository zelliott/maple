zzso downstream regulated gene 1 zzso has been well zzso to act as a zzso zzso in a number of human zzso It has also been implicated to have a significant function in a number of zzso processes such as cellular differentiation and cell zzso In this review, we discuss the role of zzso in cancer zzso zzso was observed to be zzso in the majority of zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso was found to be significantly lower in zzso zzso as compared with normal zzso The most important function of zzso in zzso zzso progression is associated with its ability to suppress zzso However, it has also been shown to have important effects on other stages of cancer progression zzso zzso growth and zzso Recently, novel iron zzso with selective zzso activity zzso zzso zzso were shown to zzso zzso in cancer zzso Moreover, zzso showed its zzso potential only in cells expressing zzso making this protein an important therapeutic target for cancer zzso This observation has led to increased interest in the examination of these novel zzso zzso
