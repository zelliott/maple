Imaging mass zzso zzso is a two-dimensional mass zzso to zzso the spatial distribution of zzso that does not need either separation or zzso of target molecules and enables us to monitor not only the identification of unknown molecules but also the zzso of numerous molecules zzso Among the zzso techniques, zzso laser zzso zzso is one of those most generally used for zzso which allows the analysis of numerous zzso ranging over wide molecular zzso At present, targets of IMS research have expanded to the imaging of small zzso zzso such as zzso zzso drug zzso exploring new disease zzso and other new scientific zzso
