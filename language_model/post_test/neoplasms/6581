This paper reviews the experimental results of our research in the past several years and other related papers that have been directed toward the zzso zzso and zzso significance of zzso zzso compounds in zzso zzso zzso are a group of zzso compounds produced in zzso from harmless zzso This category has been exemplified by the well-known zzso zzso zzso The significance of naturally occurring zzso and zzso as precursors of zzso zzso compounds in zzso and their implication in the zzso of human cancer have been investigated and zzso Extremely high levels of zzso and zzso were detected in zzso and other zzso More than zzso of zzso were converted to zzso and zzso on zzso Low levels of zzso and zzso were also detected in the fermented soybean products, wines and zzso Both zzso and zzso are excellent precursors of zzso Several naturally occurring aromatic zzso especially zzso derivatives such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and become more zzso to zzso zzso after zzso zzso amounts of zzso were detected in the popular spice white and black pepper zzso Under zzso condition, zzso zzso readily with zzso to form zzso zzso zzso was formed from the reaction of zzso with the zzso drug zzso This new compound showed strong zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and strong zzso activity to zzso chicken zzso Studies have shown that the majority of zzso compounds in the body come from in zzso zzso Most investigators believe that this zzso pool of zzso compounds may prove to be a major exposure route in zzso The presence of naturally occurring zzso and zzso in the diet then becomes one of the crucial limiting steps in the formation of zzso zzso compounds in zzso
