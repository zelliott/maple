zzso of the zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso is important for optimal zzso binding and zzso zzso is a tumor zzso gene that exhibits loss of zzso and is zzso in several zzso We tested the potential zzso effects of two zzso zzso that zzso zzso in zzso repeats 9 and zzso Our hypothesis was that zzso of the truncated receptors with the zzso full-length zzso would interfere with zzso function by zzso zzso zzso confirmed formation of zzso complexes between full-length zzso and the truncated zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso increasing expression of either zzso or zzso provoked decreased levels of full-length zzso in both cell zzso and plasma zzso indicating a zzso effect on zzso zzso Loss of full-length zzso was not due to increased zzso or zzso degradation, but instead arose from increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulting in zzso release, by a mechanism that was inhibited by metal zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the cancer zzso by decreasing the availability of full-length zzso to perform zzso functions such as zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso
