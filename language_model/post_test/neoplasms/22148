A growing body of literature demonstrates that the unfolded protein response zzso is activated in a number of zzso Recent data suggests that the zzso may play a role in protecting transformed cells from the inadequate environment that exists prior to zzso and therefore contribute to tumor growth and zzso In addition, data from cell culture based studies demonstrate that pharmacological zzso of the zzso can alter the sensitivity of cells to zzso agents, making them either more sensitive in some cases or more resistant in zzso Thus, it will be important to understand and integrate data on the role of the zzso in tumor growth and survival with studies on the effects of zzso zzso on zzso before considering therapeutic interventions into this signaling zzso
