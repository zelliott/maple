Many recent studies suggest the immune system plays a significant role in the zzso of zzso diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, and zzso 

Literature published between 2001 and 2011 was reviewed for risk of cancer development in patients with zzso and chronic inflammatory zzso zzso of risk assessment employed did not limit inclusion of zzso zzso conditions developing after diagnosis of a pre-existing cancer were also zzso 

We report a zzso largely positive association between 23 zzso and inflammatory diseases and subsequent cancer zzso We discuss associations for zzso disease, inflammatory zzso disease zzso arthritis, systemic lupus zzso and multiple sclerosis in zzso We also address the less frequently reported development of some zzso conditions within the course of some zzso such as zzso developing in the course of zzso 

Evidence demonstrates that chronic inflammation and zzso are associated with the development of zzso Additionally, patients with a primary zzso may develop zzso like zzso These relationships imply a need for surveillance of patients on zzso therapies for potential secondary disease zzso
