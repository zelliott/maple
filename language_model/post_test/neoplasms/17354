In this paper, uniform hollow zzso zzso zzso were successfully prepared by a facile zzso synthesis route without using any zzso zzso and further zzso zzso The precursor zzso spheres are prepared by a zzso zzso After that, uniform and zzso zzso hollow spheres were easily zzso with zzso at the sacrifice of the precursor with low temperature and short reaction zzso X-ray zzso scanning electron zzso transmission electron zzso high-resolution zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to characterize the zzso zzso It is found that the initial pH value and zzso zzso ratios play important roles in the structures, sizes, and zzso of the hollow zzso The growth mechanism of the hollow spheres has been systematically investigated based on the zzso zzso Under zzso zzso zzso laser zzso UC zzso of the zzso zzso zzso hollow spheres can be changed by a simple adjustment of the concentration of the zzso zzso zzso red zzso is obtained by introducing zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, a zzso release experiment and a zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that the product has potential application in drug delivery and targeted cancer zzso
