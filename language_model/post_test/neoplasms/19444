We investigate microscopic pH zzso within tumor zzso using a novel zzso zzso methodology that provides high resolution zzso of zzso zzso 

High resolution microscopic images of zzso pH were obtained by zzso zzso using chemical shift selective zzso of the zzso resonance of zzso added to the incubation zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso space in a pH dependent zzso zzso of zzso pH could be obtained by transforming zzso by zzso (32 zzso 32 zzso the regional variation of zzso zzso intensity into a relative pH zzso 

Our analysis revealed drastic zzso pH zzso depending on the size of the zzso zzso zzso pH units more zzso in the zzso core than in the zzso for zzso of 600 zzso zzso The presence of concentric regions having similar zzso pH was consistently zzso The thickness of these regions decreased from pH zzso to pH zzso and increased below the latter pH zzso 

Our observations are compatible with the general model of zzso growth where the more external layers of cells are in active growth and depict more alkaline pH values while the inner layers remain zzso or evolve to a zzso core, depicting more zzso pH zzso
