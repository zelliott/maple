zzso zzso zzso are molecules used to link different zzso based on unique zzso that allows controlled zzso Two different zzso zzso were used to prepare chemical zzso zzso The first is based on a spontaneous zzso reaction to form a stable ring zzso zzso of the trigger generates a free zzso for example, an zzso group, which zzso zzso to release the target zzso from the handle part zzso a targeting zzso or a solid support for zzso The second applied zzso is an elimination reaction, which is usually based on a zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of the trigger generates a free zzso zzso which can undergo a zzso reaction through a zzso zzso to release the target zzso The zzso molecules have been applied in the field of drug delivery to release a drug from a targeting device and in the field of zzso synthesis to release a synthetic zzso from the solid zzso A chemical zzso zzso has also been used as a building unit to construct zzso with a triggered zzso
