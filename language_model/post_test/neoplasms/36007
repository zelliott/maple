Cancer zzso is characterized by zzso and with the zzso production of zzso proteins in response to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of zzso on the zzso disposition of and clinical responses to zzso in cancer zzso 

zzso Japanese patients receiving zzso zzso zzso as a starting zzso for cancer pain were enrolled in this zzso zzso was evaluated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso of zzso and zzso were determined at the zzso zzso 

Seven patients had a zzso of 0, 21 a zzso of 1, and 19 had a zzso of zzso A higher zzso was significantly correlated with a higher zzso concentration and a lower concentration ratio of zzso to zzso and significantly associated with a lower zzso of dose escalation and a higher zzso of central adverse zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the free fraction of zzso zzso zzso concentration was significantly associated with the zzso of dose zzso In contrast, the free fraction of zzso and zzso proteins were not related to the clinical zzso 

zzso had an effect on zzso metabolism and the clinical responses to zzso The observed reduction in serum zzso concentration was associated with dose zzso These findings suggest that zzso affects the clinical responses to zzso through zzso and nutritional disorders in cancer zzso
