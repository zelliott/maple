Clinical characteristics and management of acute deep vein zzso and pulmonary embolism zzso have been reported to be different in patients with and without zzso The aim of this paper was to provide information on clinical characteristics and management of acute zzso zzso in patients with cancer by means of a large prospective zzso 

zzso is a zzso registry of zzso recruited patients with zzso zzso confirmed, acute zzso zzso Information about clinical characteristics and management was collected by an electronic data network at the time of the index zzso 

A total of zzso patients were zzso of whom zzso zzso had zzso The zzso of bilateral lower limb deep vein zzso was significantly higher in patients with cancer than in patients without cancer zzso versus zzso zzso as were the rates of zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and upper limb deep vein zzso zzso versus zzso zzso Major bleeding zzso versus zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso versus zzso zzso and inferior zzso zzso filter zzso zzso versus zzso zzso were significantly more frequent in patients with cancer, in whom oral zzso were less often used zzso versus zzso zzso 

The clinical presentation of acute zzso zzso is different and often more extensive in cancer patients than in patients free from zzso Moreover, the management of the acute phase of zzso zzso is more problematic in cancer patients, especially because of a higher rate of major bleeding and the need for zzso of inferior zzso zzso zzso
