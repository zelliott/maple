A reduced risk for cancer has been noted among persons with schizophrenia as well as their first degree zzso One explanation for these findings suggests that genes associated with schizophrenia zzso reduced cancer zzso Given the well documented genetic factor in schizophrenia it could thus be expected that cancer zzso rates should be lower in persons with schizophrenia with a known family history of schizophrenia compared to persons with sporadic zzso as well as their first degree zzso This study investigated the risk for cancer among the biological parents of persons with schizophrenia accounting for the familial zzso zzso was conducted between national population, psychiatric and cancer zzso zzso zzso rates for all cancer sites were calculated by comparing the parents' rates with those of the general zzso In addition, the association between familial zzso of schizophrenia and risk for cancer was calculated among the zzso A reduced cancer risk was found among the parents compared to the general population zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no evidence of decreased risk was associated with familial zzso Thus, no association between familial zzso and cancer incidents was found with regard to most cancer zzso Moreover, a small, but not statistically significant increased risk of colon cancer was associated with familial zzso scores among the parents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings undermine the support to the genetic explanation for the reduced risk for cancer in schizophrenia among patients and their biological zzso
