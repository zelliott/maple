Progress against zzso mortality could be estimated by mortality zzso However, zzso measures may not be comparable to trends across time based on individual cases followed over zzso For two leading cancer types zzso and lung and zzso the following were calculated from the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso Program survival zzso zzso probability of death zzso as the relative cumulative deaths in a cohort of cancer patients at 12-month intervals after the year of diagnosis, zzso survival zzso and median survival zzso Annual zzso zzso mortality rates were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso having survived up to 5 years after zzso decreased zzso from zzso in contrast to a zzso decrease in the mortality rate during the same zzso The mortality rate for lung and zzso cancer sharply increased between 1973 and 1991 and was followed by a clear downward trend of zzso from zzso while its zzso zzso decreased by only zzso zzso for specific zzso at yearly intervals did not improve across time at comparable zzso however, the mortality rate was clearly reduced for both zzso zzso Survival and zzso were, as expected, zzso zzso Changes in median survival and zzso survival probability were similar over zzso Although the cancer mortality rate is a clear statistical zzso zzso of success by its falling trend alone could be unrelated to the zzso probability of zzso
