A mathematical model of zzso of tumor zzso has been developed on the basis of the physical theory of zzso According to the model, one of the important zzso factors of tumors consists of their internal elastic forces determining the structure of tumor zzso and intermittent zzso pattern of their zzso The existence of a certain zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso by the size of the tumor and its zzso zzso was established the passing of which lead to a sharp decrease in the tissue pressure in zzso zzso The zzso of tissue pressure in tumor zzso is the leading zzso factor of secondary changes and results in the appearance of a typical zzso zzso structure of zzso On the basis of the rate of tumor growth alone, the model allows the intensity of their cell division to be determined and also shows the process of cell proliferation in tumor zzso to be subject to the zzso of zzso number zzso
