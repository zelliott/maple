The purpose of this study was to evaluate the adverse effects of chronic marked zzso on clinical diagnostic performance of zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso 

zzso scans of 54 patients, who received zzso for the diagnosis of various zzso and who showed high plasma zzso level of more than 200 zzso at the time of administration of zzso in spite of at least zzso zzso were zzso zzso In the clinical zzso this high plasma zzso was confirmed as chronic zzso derived from uncontrolled diabetes zzso zzso zzso and zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso Based on the final diagnosis of zzso obtained by zzso or clinical follow-up for at least 6 months, the diagnostic performance of visual PET analysis was zzso 

Excluding nine scans of nine patients without sufficient zzso final diagnosis was obtained in 48 scans of 45 zzso In 36 scans of 36 patients, at least one zzso zzso was finally confirmed, and zzso and zzso results were obtained in 30 and six cases, zzso Six cases showed zzso results due to low zzso pathological characteristics zzso zzso zzso zzso effect or small tumor zzso Overall, the zzso sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, negative zzso value and diagnostic accuracy were 83, 83, 94, 63 and zzso zzso In zzso diagnosis, 56 of 75 zzso zzso were depicted by zzso while 19 zzso were negative on zzso also due to low zzso characteristics or small size (less than 15 zzso 

At the time of chronic zzso (not acute zzso the adverse effect caused by high plasma zzso level was zzso The zzso zzso of the tumor maintained a sufficiently high level for visual clinical diagnosis in most cases, except in the cases of low zzso tumors or small zzso (15 zzso in zzso
