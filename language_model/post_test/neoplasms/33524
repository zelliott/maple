An zzso zzso method allows the zzso zzso and initial characterization of reiterated DNA restriction fragments zzso without prior possession of their zzso Using this method we analyzed zzso restricted zzso from ten human tumors, paired normal zzso from these patients, ten zzso tumors, and 26 zzso zzso zzso qualitative and quantitative differences in the relative radioactive zzso of all or specific zzso in the DNA from different individuals have been zzso However, we also report frequent two- to zzso zzso in the relative radioactive zzso of several specific zzso in zzso analyses of DNA from the same zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso was decreased in six tumors and increased in zzso Moreover, a new zzso zzso was observed in two colon cancer zzso Several new zzso suggestive of gene amplification, were detected in a zzso two of which were also seen in a zzso These data support frequent qualitative and quantitative zzso of specific reiterated DNA sequences in human cancer when compared with paired zzso This approach will allow the future characterization of specific DNA sequences whose patterns of altered zzso suggest a role in the emergence of specific zzso
