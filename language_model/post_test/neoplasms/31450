Cancer zzso and mortality rates both began to decline in the zzso zzso in the early zzso Recognizing the unprecedented potential benefits of accelerating this decline, the American Cancer Society zzso has set ambitious challenge goals for the American public for a zzso reduction in cancer zzso rates and a 50% reduction in cancer mortality rates by the year zzso This analysis examined the feasibility of reaching those goals by zzso future changes in cancer rates that can result from past and future reductions in cancer risk zzso 

Estimates for future declines in cancer risk factors in the zzso zzso under alternative scenarios were applied to conservative zzso risk estimates for cancer zzso and mortality rates in 1990 to estimate cancer rate trends in the year zzso 

If the current trends toward a decline in the prevalence of cancer risk factors continue over the next decade, by the year zzso one can expect a zzso decline in cancer zzso rates and a zzso decline in cancer mortality rates below their 1990 zzso With zzso efforts to reduce the prevalence of known cancer risk factors further, by the year zzso cancer zzso rates could be reduced by zzso and cancer mortality rates reduced by zzso Such zzso efforts would equate to approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 60,000 cancer deaths prevented each year by the year zzso 

Past reductions in cancer risk factors in the zzso population have led to recent declines in the rates of cancer zzso and mortality in the zzso zzso efforts to act on current knowledge regarding how to zzso zzso and treat cancer can result in attaining approximately zzso of the zzso challenge goal for cancer zzso rates and zzso of the zzso challenge goal for cancer mortality rates by the year zzso New findings from cancer research are needed and will have to be applied quickly if the zzso challenge goals are to be met zzso
