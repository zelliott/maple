zzso access has contributed to widespread racial disparities in cancer care in the United zzso However, the outcomes for racial minorities at zzso hospitals, such as those participating in the American College of Surgeons National zzso Quality Improvement Program zzso zzso remain zzso We hypothesized that operative outcomes for racial and ethnic minority patients after cancer surgery at zzso zzso hospitals are comparable with those for white zzso 

Using the zzso zzso zzso data, we identified zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso or pelvic cancer zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to examine the association between race and ethnicity and short-term zzso operative outcomes after cancer zzso zzso analyses were performed to ensure the relationship remained consistent after zzso by zzso 

zzso patients constituted zzso of patients treated for cancer surgery in zzso zzso zzso Although nonwhite patients were more likely to have higher levels of zzso and undergo more complex zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that these patients were as likely as white patients to have adverse short-term operative outcomes develop after cancer zzso These results persisted after zzso by extent of surgical zzso However, black, Hispanic, and zzso patients were more likely to experience prolonged length of stay zzso ratio for black vs white patients zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso and ethnic minority patients who undergo their cancer surgery at zzso zzso hospitals have short-term operative outcomes similar to white patients, but they remain hospitalized zzso These findings suggest that access to zzso hospitals might zzso racial disparities in cancer care and zzso Future policies should focus on expanding access to zzso surgical facilities as a step toward timely and optimal cancer zzso
