In the last few years, considerable interest has been generated in the role of zzso zzso zzso and zzso box proteins generally, in cancer development and zzso These proteins were discovered in the early 1970s zzso et zzso zzso as a group of zzso zzso Some members of the zzso protein family zzso constitute a class of important architectural proteins involved in zzso regulation of zzso zzso are frequently expressed in transformed cells at levels that correlate with the degree of zzso cell zzso zzso participate in gene zzso which are linked to the emergence of benign solid tumors, zzso zzso the ability to recognize zzso zzso zzso and zzso provide a new delivery system for efficient gene zzso It should be considered that some zzso zzso acting as architectural proteins that bring many of the zzso factors into precise three-dimensional shapes, may have a similar critical role in zzso transformation to that of some zzso factors zzso
