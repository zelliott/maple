It is generally believed that zzso spots should be avoided in zzso because they lead to zzso zzso zzso within the target volume is much more difficult to achieve during zzso than during external beam zzso and implants are rarely zzso zzso To not zzso some parts of the target volume, therefore, it may be necessary to accept hot spots in other parts of the target volumes, but it is not at all clear from the literature how much dose zzso should be considered zzso We undertook this study in an effort to determine just how high a dose to a hot spot is associated with clinically significant zzso 

We studied 40 patients treated by high-dose rate zzso with or without external zzso For each patient, we calculated the minimum dose to the zzso 1 cubic zzso zzso volume zzso and, for 18 patients, the minimum dose to the hottest 10 zzso volume zzso as zzso 

zzso dose zzso existed within the target zzso The zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso of the minimum target dose zzso The median zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the median zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The median zzso from the entire course of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Adding the doses from planned external zzso plus any prior zzso to the same area, the median total zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso yet the zzso of zzso even among those in the highest zzso of this dose range, was not greater than the lowest zzso The total median zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso of complications was, again, similar whether the dose was in the lower or the upper half of this range zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

We had expected to find that the patients with the highest zzso and/or zzso would be the ones most likely to suffer zzso but the results did not support this zzso Thus, dose zzso within the scope of our study, turned out to be rather zzso with regard to zzso This finding contradicts the conventional wisdom and suggests that concerns about hot spots need not zzso zzso to ensure adequate dosage to all parts of the target zzso
