zzso of therapeutic outcomes and risk factors was undertaken for patients with primary solid tumors zzso developing acute leukemia or zzso zzso as a second zzso 

In all, 131 consecutive patients presenting to a single institution with leukemia or zzso after treatment for zzso with surgery or zzso were zzso Management of the secondary acute leukemia and zzso consisted either of intensive therapy including zzso blood and zzso transplants or supportive zzso 

The time from diagnosis of zzso to development of acute leukemia or zzso the zzso profile of patients, and their survival were similar irrespective of zzso therapy with surgery alone or strategies involving chemotherapy and/or zzso The median survival of all 131 patients was zzso months with a zzso survival of zzso zzso therapy and/or transplantation resulted in a median survival of zzso months and a zzso survival of zzso compared with zzso months and zzso with supportive zzso zzso analysis of transplant recipients revealed a median survival of zzso months and a zzso zzso zzso Despite a significantly lower recurrence rate the survival of transplant recipients was not improved secondary to a higher zzso mortality zzso zzso 

Patients developing acute leukemia or zzso after zzso demonstrated similar zzso profiles and clinical outcomes independent of the type of zzso Survival was significantly better for patients able to undergo intensive therapy compared with supportive zzso The low recurrence rate for zzso recipients was consistent with a potent zzso effect that may translate into a survival benefit if zzso could be zzso
