zzso and zzso progression are zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso Here we report that the local density of zzso zzso in cancer zzso is highly reduced specifically in accessible regulatory DNA defined by zzso I hypersensitive zzso This reduction is independent of any known factors influencing zzso zzso density and is observed in diverse cancer types, suggesting a general zzso By analyzing individual cancer zzso we show that the reduced local zzso density within regulatory DNA is linked to intact global zzso repair machinery, with nearly complete zzso of the zzso phenomenon in individual zzso that possess zzso in components of the zzso zzso repair zzso Together, our results connect zzso structure, gene regulation and zzso zzso zzso
