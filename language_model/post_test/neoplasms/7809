This article surveys the available data on the sensitivity of drug-resistant tumor cells to zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso In our own study, three different experimental systems were zzso zzso in zzso treatment of tumor cells with an zzso drug followed by the use of surviving cells as targets of zzso zzso use of pairs of drug-resistant and zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of several tumor clones obtained from the same zzso The zzso activity of zzso was evaluated both by the zzso release and the human tumor zzso zzso zzso In all the experimental systems used, drug-resistant tumor cells were found to be significantly zzso by zzso with a consistent trend towards a higher zzso than their zzso zzso A positive correlation between the sensitivity to zzso and the zzso for zzso zzso was found in 44 melanoma clones zzso suggesting that spontaneously drug-resistant clones have a higher sensitivity to zzso than the zzso zzso zzso cells were also more sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso whereas the higher zzso of drug-resistant tumor cells exerted by zzso was maintained in a zzso dependent zzso zzso These data offer a rationale for combining chemotherapy with adoptive zzso in the treatment of zzso Moreover, studying the reasons for the higher zzso sensitivity of drug-resistant tumor cells may provide insights into the mechanisms by which tumor cells can resist zzso zzso
