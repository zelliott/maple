The rationale for immune control of cancer is now better defined via the zzso of transforming zzso definition of human tumor zzso recognized by zzso and cellular and zzso components of the zzso zzso Nonetheless tumors can escape from immune zzso To better define zzso strategies, we describe some of the various strategies developed by transformed cells to evade the immune zzso 

Both the lack of specific tumor zzso and zzso of major zzso complex zzso zzso expression hamper recognition of zzso cells by zzso In presence of defective expression of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso tumor recognition may lead to the development of tolerance instead of specific zzso zzso zzso cell zzso against zzso zzso has also been zzso using either zzso zzso zzso zzso induction (via zzso zzso functional zzso zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso or induction of zzso 

Despite the many different mechanisms of tumor escape, the immune system has developed efficient zzso For instance, natural killer cells may detect and destroy tumor cells that lack class 1 zzso molecules and thus escape from specific zzso zzso Moreover, zzso can be zzso at least in zzso by different means such as tumor cell stimulation by zzso or zzso suggesting that therapeutic strategies will soon be developed in order to stimulate an efficient zzso immune zzso
