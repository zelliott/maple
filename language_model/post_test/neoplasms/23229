The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a rendezvous between zzso degradation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso These processes are, however, tightly linked because the high affinity binding of zzso regulates the binding of zzso to zzso zzso Although crystal structures exist to define the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes, it is evident that the dynamic property of zzso plays a decisive role in its zzso In the present study, we combine small angle zzso zzso zzso exchange, and surface zzso resonance to develop a structural model describing the zzso regulation of zzso We show that the flexibility of its zzso domain provides the key for understanding this zzso zzso zzso our model has direct implications for understanding zzso cell zzso and migration as well as for zzso research, including targeted intervention therapy and zzso tumor imaging in zzso
