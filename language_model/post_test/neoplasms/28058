zzso engineered zzso offer an intriguing new approach to selectively target solid tumors, including melanoma, zzso zzso breast, kidney and zzso These bacteria target tumors after systemic administration and selectively replicate within zzso zzso for tumors is often more than 1,000 times greater than for any other zzso zzso zzso make these bacteria highly safe and form the basis for maintaining tumor zzso An altered zzso greatly reduces the potential for septic shock yet also retains the zzso properties of these zzso These bacteria have innate zzso activity towards both primary and zzso tumors and the ability to deliver proteins capable of zzso zzso agents directly within zzso The delay in tumor growth results in mice that survive up to twice as zzso These bacteria are susceptible to a wide range of zzso allowing external control of the zzso after zzso The combination of these features within a single zzso seems specially surprising considering their unlikely zzso
