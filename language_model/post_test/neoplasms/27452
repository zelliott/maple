This work presents initial experimental results obtained with zzso of human zzso zzso from patients with various diseases (5 patients each zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso patients each zzso 

After two-hour zzso of the graft with human zzso of different patients zzso zzso peripheral zzso vascular zzso diabetes zzso zzso zzso the following parameters were determined by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The change in the zzso expression was taken as a measure of zzso with statistically significant differences seen within and between the zzso For the zzso zzso such differences were mainly noted for the zzso zzso zzso For the two-hour incubation with collagen zzso the receptors zzso and zzso were indicative of differences between the various diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso revealed statistically significant differences for the zzso and the zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The differences noted between the zzso and between the patients groups are suggestive of an altered responsiveness of the zzso to the zzso This enables new aspects with respect to the genesis of accompanying clinical zzso
