Our goal was to determine the risk of cancer after hospitalization for zzso 

Records of zzso women hospitalized with zzso during the period 1969 to 1983, as identified through the nationwide Swedish zzso zzso were linked against the National Swedish Cancer zzso through 1989 to identify all subsequent diagnoses of zzso The study subjects were followed up for a mean of zzso years, with the cohort contributing zzso woman years of zzso zzso zzso ratios were zzso by the use of zzso and zzso zzso rates derived from the Swedish zzso Because of the high proportion of subjects with zzso operations zzso evaluation of the risk of zzso zzso involved zzso of person years at the time of any such zzso 

The overall cancer risk was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso excesses were observed for breast cancer zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso this latter excess was largely driven by an excess risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The risk of zzso cancer was particularly elevated among subjects with a long-standing history of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso cancer risk was slightly reduced zzso zzso to zzso whereas no association was observed for cancer of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

These findings suggest that further attention be given to the risk of breast, zzso and zzso zzso among women with zzso and to exploring possible hormonal and zzso reasons for the excess zzso
