zzso that mediate zzso tumor zzso activity remain largely zzso In this study we describe a systematic approach to identify downstream zzso of tumor zzso function of zzso consisting of global gene expression zzso focused short hairpin zzso zzso library creation, and functional selection of genetic elements cooperating with zzso Ras in cell zzso This approach is based on our finding that repression of gene expression is a major event, occurring in response to zzso zzso during transformation and zzso of primary zzso zzso analysis of the subset of genes universally zzso in the cells that lacked functional zzso revealed zzso as a major downstream zzso of zzso proliferation arrest of mouse and human zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso Ras to transform primary mouse zzso containing zzso zzso active zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso D1 and E1 and zzso of zzso and, in cooperation with other zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation of primary human zzso zzso expression was found to be significantly reduced in a large proportion of human kidney and breast zzso suggesting that zzso is a tumor zzso that links zzso and zzso pathways in human zzso
