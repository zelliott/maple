The current means of evaluating the quality of life zzso of cancer patients, generally employ a zzso approach involving validated self-administered zzso In measuring zzso as well as in interpreting the results of an assessment, the patient, zzso and setting of administration may all give rise to zzso 

Based on our experience and review of a large number of published papers, the most relevant problems in evaluating zzso of cancer patients are zzso 

The difficulties that patients have with the most frequently used zzso questionnaires are demonstrated by the fact that more than zzso of patients who gave their consent to be enrolled in a zzso study measuring zzso did not fill out the first zzso This percentage is higher among older patients having a low level of zzso in patients with zzso disease, and among those with a low performance zzso Moreover, in zzso studies, there is a very high zzso of zzso often correlated with the progression of disease, so that the results are sometimes zzso 

Quality of life, depending not only on the type and stage of disease, and the administered treatment, but also on patient zzso should be assessed only in a zzso clinical zzso In any case, the most relevant problem is connected to the selection bias due to zzso zzso for this should be sought in the apparent complexity of the questionnaire and inadequate information given to the zzso zzso instruments, which can be filled out in a shorter period of time, and specific training by research nurses could help minimize this excessive zzso
