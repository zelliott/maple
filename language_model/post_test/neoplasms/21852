When considering either human adult zzso (in zzso or cell cultures (in zzso cell number is regulated by the relationship between zzso cells, zzso cells, cell death and other controls of cell cycle zzso By zzso a mathematical description we see that even small zzso of this relationship may cause a zzso population to start growing with doubling times characteristic of human zzso Our model consists of two age structured partial differential equations for the zzso and zzso cell zzso Model parameters are death rates from and transition rates between these zzso The partial differential equations can be solved for the zzso zzso giving the distribution of the cells through the cell cycle, dependent on specific model zzso zzso zzso formulas can then be derived for various population characteristic quantities such as zzso index, proliferation zzso doubling time and potential doubling time of the cell zzso Such characteristic quantities can be estimated zzso although with decreasing precision from in zzso to in zzso experimental systems and to the zzso The model can be used to investigate the effects of a single zzso of either zzso or cell death control on the growth of the whole population and the zzso dependence of the doubling time and other zzso quantities on particular underlying cell cycle scenarios of death and zzso The model indicates that zzso evolution in zzso is a sequence of zzso each zzso by particular death and zzso rate zzso We suggest that a key passage of zzso is a loss of the communication between zzso death and cell cycle zzso causing a zzso in their precise, cell cycle dependent zzso
