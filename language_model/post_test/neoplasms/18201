The importance of zzso cells for tumor is akin to soil for zzso However, the interaction among these cells is far from zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso exist not only during tumor progression but also during zzso stage, together with immune zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with tumor cells often promotes tumor zzso However, the presence of zzso significantly zzso the ability of these cells to promote tumor growth due to a reduced zzso The mechanism relies mainly on the zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor production by zzso The results reveal a novel link between immune cells and zzso zzso zzso cells, and define zzso zzso as the main targets of zzso in tumor zzso
