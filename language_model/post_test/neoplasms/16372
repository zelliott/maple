In 1996, the zzso Sections of the Children's Cancer Group zzso and the zzso Oncology Group zzso received National Cancer Institute funding to conduct a zzso randomized, controlled, zzso study to evaluate the role of minimally invasive surgery zzso in children with zzso Because of lack of patient zzso the study was closed in zzso The purpose of this study is to evaluate and describe those factors that impacted on study failure to ensure future successful clinical zzso 

One hundred zzso surgeons representing the surgical membership of zzso and zzso as well as 111 institutions within zzso and zzso were asked to complete a questionnaire about the failed clinical zzso The questionnaire focused on study zzso organization, and institutional review board zzso zzso It also examined the zzso ability to perform the minimal access operation, the influence of the pediatric oncologist, and the existence of zzso biases by zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis was performed as zzso 

Eighty-six of 140 zzso surgeons responded to the zzso Only zzso of the potential protocols were submitted for zzso zzso Of responding zzso zzso were not actively performing zzso when the study zzso A zzso support of the study was directly related to when the surgeon received the protocols zzso zzso and whether the participating surgeon was actively participating in zzso zzso zzso The zzso knowledge and support of the study affected zzso submission and approval zzso zzso and was influenced by whether zzso was practiced at the institution zzso zzso The majority of responding surgeons believed the experimental question was relevant zzso zzso However, responding surgeons believed that a zzso bias existed within both their local surgical and zzso communities favoring a particular surgical approach zzso zzso but this bias did not extend to the families zzso zzso 

The study failed because of lack of zzso for a variety of reasons: failure to submit to the institution's zzso lack of surgical expertise with zzso procedures, and zzso surgeon bias toward either an zzso or traditional open zzso
