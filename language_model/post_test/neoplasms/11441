zzso fatty acids are zzso to reduce the risk of zzso Studies have reported mixed zzso 

To zzso published and unpublished evidence to determine estimates of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk in prospective cohort zzso 

Articles published from 1966 to October 2005 identified through zzso zzso zzso Cochrane Central Register of Controlled zzso and zzso zzso unpublished literature sought through letters to experts in the zzso zzso 

A total of 38 articles with a description of effects of consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on tumor zzso prospective cohort study design, human study population; and description of effect of omega-3 among groups with different levels of exposure in the cohort were zzso Two zzso independently reviewed articles using structured abstraction zzso disagreements were resolved by zzso 

Two zzso independently zzso detailed data about the zzso of cancer, the type of cancer, the number and characteristics of the patients, details on the exposure to omega-3 fatty zzso and the elapsed time between the intervention and outcome zzso Data about the zzso quality of the study were also zzso 

Across 20 zzso from 7 countries for 11 different types of cancer and using up to 6 different ways to categorize omega-3 fatty acid consumption, 65 estimates of the association between omega-3 fatty acid consumption were zzso Among these, only 8 were statistically zzso The high degree of zzso across these studies precluded pooling of zzso For breast cancer 1 significant estimate was for increased risk zzso risk ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and 3 were for decreased risk zzso zzso 7 other estimates did not show a significant zzso For zzso cancer, there was 1 estimate of decreased risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 17 estimates without zzso For lung cancer one of the significant associations was for increased cancer risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the other was for decreased risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4 other estimates were not zzso For prostate cancer, there was 1 estimate of decreased risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1 of increased risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for advanced prostate zzso 15 other estimates did not show a significant zzso The study that assessed skin cancer found an increased risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant associations between omega-3 fatty acid consumption and cancer zzso were found for zzso cancer, zzso cancer, lymphoma, zzso cancer, pancreatic cancer, or stomach zzso 

A large body of literature spanning numerous zzso from many countries and with different demographic characteristics does not provide evidence to suggest a significant association between omega-3 fatty acids and cancer zzso zzso supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids is unlikely to prevent zzso
