zzso and zzso We investigated immune recovery in 50 patients given either zzso or zzso zzso peripheral blood stem cells after zzso zzso 

Fifty patients were zzso to receive either zzso zzso or zzso zzso peripheral blood stem zzso The median patients age was 57 zzso zzso zzso The conditioning regimen consisted of 2 zzso total body zzso with or without added zzso Twenty patients received zzso from related donors, 14 from zzso zzso matched unrelated donors, and 16 from zzso unrelated zzso zzso disease zzso consisted of zzso zzso and zzso zzso recovery during the first year after zzso cell transplantation was assessed by flow zzso zzso analyses of the diversity of the zzso repertoire, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso circles zzso 

zzso of the graft reduced the recovery of zzso zzso counts in the first 6 months following transplantation zzso but had no significant impact on the restoration of other zzso zzso Both zzso concentration and zzso zzso counts increased significantly between day 100 and 365 zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating zzso of T cells by the zzso zzso associated with high zzso concentration 1 year after transplantation included an zzso unrelated donor zzso a high content of T cells in the graft zzso and the absence of chronic zzso disease zzso 

Our data suggest that while immune recovery is mainly driven by peripheral expansion of the zzso mature T cells during the first months after zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso plays an important role in long term immune zzso in transplanted zzso
