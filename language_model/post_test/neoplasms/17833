To evaluate the effect of the zzso drug zzso on plasma zzso and urinary zzso of zzso zzso and its main zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso 

Plasma and urine zzso of zzso and zzso from 11 patients on zzso therapy (1 h intravenous zzso zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso or zzso were determined by zzso liquid zzso with zzso zzso 

Before zzso therapy, the mean zzso zzso plasma zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and remained constant throughout the entire study zzso In contrast, urinary zzso of zzso and zzso increased significantly during the chemotherapy from 115 zzso 105 to zzso zzso 348 zzso zzso zzso zzso and from 41 zzso 41 to 89 zzso 52 zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, subsequently reverting to normal 6 days after the end of zzso Similarly, the zzso clearance of zzso and zzso increased substantially during chemotherapy from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, reverting to normal 6 days after the end of zzso Plasma zzso and urinary zzso of zzso zzso and zzso nitrogen and zzso zzso however, were not affected by zzso therapy, indicating no impaired kidney zzso 

Treatment with zzso was associated with a marked urinary loss of zzso and zzso most likely due to zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso
