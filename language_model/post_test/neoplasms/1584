A short-term zzso method able to estimate the radiation response of human cancer tissue samples would be of great advantage to the zzso of zzso in cancer zzso However, the effect of radiation on zzso incorporation by zzso cells reflects a composite of cell cycle arrest and induced cell death zzso Here we consider whether it is feasible to correct for cell cycle effects based on comparison of the effects of radiation and the zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso zzso zzso short-term zzso cultures of human tumor tissue from 61 patients with melanoma, zzso cancer, brain cancer, and head and neck cancer, as well as 18 zzso cultures of low passage human tumor cell lines, were zzso at doses from 2 to 9 zzso or exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation was measured at the end of the zzso Cell cycle times could be estimated from the zzso data and were zzso to zzso days for zzso zzso to zzso days for zzso zzso to 39 days for brain tumors, and zzso to zzso days for cell zzso The effects of radiation on zzso incorporation varied widely zzso and zzso zzso for 2 and 9 zzso respectively), and in 23 of the clinical samples, but in none of the cell lines, radiation caused significantly greater zzso of zzso incorporation than zzso zzso zzso zzso We argue that that these differences reflect zzso cell loss from zzso phase and/or S zzso zzso of short-term cultures of clinical tumor material to radiation, with appropriate correction for cell cycle effects, might have the potential to provide information on zzso cell death in individual zzso
