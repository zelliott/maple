The success of zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso deficient tumors as an zzso strategy provided zzso for a synthetic zzso approach in zzso There is therefore now active interest in expanding this approach to include other agents targeting the DNA damage response zzso We review lessons zzso from the development of zzso against DNA damage response mechanisms and envision the future of DNA repair zzso in zzso 

zzso synthetic zzso screens may potentially identify the best combinations of zzso drugs with zzso of DNA repair and the zzso or two agents acting within the zzso Efforts are currently being made to establish robust and cost-effective zzso that may be implemented within appropriate zzso in parallel with future clinical zzso zzso of relevant zzso in a zzso manner, such as with next-generation sequencing for genes implicated in zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso Novel approaches targeting the zzso are currently being evaluated and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso are now in early drug discovery and zzso 

There remains great enthusiasm in zzso practice for pursuing the strategy of synthetic zzso The future development of zzso agents targeting the zzso should include detailed zzso zzso work within early phase clinical studies wherever possible, with clear attempts to identify doses at which robust target zzso is zzso
