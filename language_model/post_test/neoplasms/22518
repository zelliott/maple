zzso of the zzso has been a hallmark of human zzso and has been linked with tumor zzso and zzso Since zzso changes can be reversed in principle, studies have been carried out to identify modifiable (such as diet and zzso factors, which possess zzso property, in hope for developing zzso based zzso zzso The goal is to achieve some degree of zzso zzso which would maintain normal gene expression status and reverse zzso through zzso or lifestyle intervention such as diet zzso The ability of dietary compounds to act zzso in cancer cells has been studied and evidence continues to surface for constituents in food and dietary supplements to influence the zzso and ultimately zzso risk of developing zzso In this chapter, we summarized the existing data, both from animal and human studies, on the capacity of natural food products to influence three key zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As discussed in the perspective, while zzso intervention that targets zzso pathways is promising, significant challenges remain in translating these scientific findings into clinical or public health practices in the context of cancer zzso
