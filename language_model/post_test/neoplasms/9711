zzso modification of proteins by zzso is involved in the regulation of a number of biological zzso While an 18 member zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been described zzso accounts for more than zzso of the zzso capacity of the zzso zzso act as a DNA zzso sensor and is activated by DNA breaks to cleave zzso into zzso and zzso to zzso long branching zzso zzso zzso zzso attached to nuclear zzso zzso Whereas zzso of zzso by mild zzso stimuli facilitate DNA repair and cell survival, severe DNA damage triggers different pathways of cell death including zzso cell death through the zzso of zzso inducing factor zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso have also been described as having a function in zzso regulation through their ability to modify zzso proteins and as a zzso of different zzso factors, most notably zzso and zzso zzso zzso or genetic zzso of zzso not only provided remarkable protection from tissue injury in various zzso stress-related disease models but it result in a clear benefit in the treatment of cancer by different mechanisms including selective killing of zzso zzso tumor cells, down regulation of zzso gene expression and decrease in the zzso threshold in the zzso with zzso and zzso We will zzso in this review the current findings and concepts for the role of zzso and zzso in the regulation of transcription, zzso stress and zzso
