The clinical and economic impacts of monitoring cardiac function in patients given zzso have yet to be determined, especially in relation to patient age, cumulative zzso dose, and the relative zzso of zzso vs alternative zzso We developed a decision analysis model that includes these factors to estimate the incremental survival benefit and zzso of using multiple gated acquisition scans to measure zzso ejection fraction before and during zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of abnormal zzso ejection fraction findings and zzso heart failure were derived from a retrospective review of 227 consecutive cases at The University of Michigan Medical Center and published zzso Multiple gated zzso monitoring minimally improved the probability of zzso survival zzso in the zzso zzso For patients who received up to 350 zzso zzso of zzso multiple gated zzso screening had an incremental cost of $425 402 per life saved for patients between the ages of zzso This incremental cost markedly decreased to zzso zzso for patients between the ages of zzso and to $86 zzso for patients older than 60 zzso The small gain in zzso survival probability secondary to multiple gated acquisition scan monitoring doubled for all age groups when the average cumulative dose for zzso reached 500 zzso zzso Variations in the cure rate differences between the zzso and alternative regimens had insignificant effects on the improvement in zzso survival rates from multiple gated zzso zzso The use of multiple gated acquisition scans for zzso screening appears to be more cost-effective for patients who are 40 years or older, when cumulative zzso dose is 350 zzso zzso or zzso
