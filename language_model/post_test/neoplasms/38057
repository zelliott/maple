The occurrence of spontaneous tumors in pet animals has been estimated in a few European and North American veterinary cancer zzso with dissimilar zzso and variable reference zzso 

The Animal zzso zzso zzso of zzso Italy, was established in 1985 with the aim of zzso the occurrence of spontaneous tumors in zzso 

Six thousand seven hundred and zzso tumor biopsy specimens were received from local veterinarians in the zzso of zzso between 1985 and zzso Three thousand and three hundred and three zzso biopsy zzso samples were diagnosed as cancer and were coded according to the International zzso zzso of Diseases zzso 

zzso cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in female dogs, accounting for zzso of all cancer zzso zzso of all zzso was zzso per 100,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso in male dogs and zzso zzso zzso zzso in female zzso The highest zzso rates were detected for zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and skin cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in male zzso All cancer zzso increased with age ranging between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in male dogs aged zzso or zzso years and zzso zzso 

This study summarizes the work done by the zzso of zzso Italy, between 1985 and zzso All cancer zzso was 3 times higher in female than in male dogs, a difference explained by the high rate of zzso cancer observed in zzso Because a biopsy zzso was required to make a cancer diagnosis, cancer rates for internal zzso zzso such as respiratory and zzso tract zzso may have been underestimated in the study zzso
