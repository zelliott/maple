zzso is one of the workhorses in clinical cancer zzso In particular, it is routinely used to characterize zzso in liver, zzso zzso head and neck and soft zzso During the last years image quality steadily improved, which, among others, can be attributed to the development of harmonic image zzso zzso were introduced as zzso contrast agents and can be detected with superb sensitivity and specificity using contrast specific imaging zzso By aid of these unspecific contrast agents zzso can be zzso regarding their zzso zzso peptides and other targeting zzso were bound to zzso to target sites of zzso and inflammation intending to get more zzso zzso Indeed, many zzso studies proved the high potential of targeted ultrasound imaging to better characterize tumors and to more sensitively monitor therapy zzso Recently, first targeted zzso had been developed that meet the pharmacological demands of a clinical contrast zzso This review articles gives an overview on the history and current status of targeted ultrasound imaging of zzso Different imaging concepts and contrast agent designs are introduced ranging from the use of experimental zzso to agents undergoing clinical zzso Although it is clear that targeted ultrasound imaging works zzso its broad acceptance is hindered by the user dependency of ultrasound imaging in zzso zzso zzso zzso being used for breast diagnosis - and novel zzso zzso will help to make this fascinating method clinical zzso
