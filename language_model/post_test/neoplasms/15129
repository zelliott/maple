zzso of the zzso cap structure by the translation initiation factor zzso is central to protein synthesis in general and zzso activity is especially important for the production of many of the proteins that give rise to the hallmarks of zzso Because transformed cells have a heightened requirement for the expression of zzso factors, targeting translation appears to be an attractive zzso strategy and zzso studies in which zzso zzso function is suppressed in various different ways show that zzso cells are selectively sensitive to zzso of protein synthesis at the level of zzso The emerging understanding of the functions, regulation, and structural biology of zzso now makes possible the pharmacological targeting of this key translation initiation zzso
