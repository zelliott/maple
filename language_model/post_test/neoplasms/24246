This review comes up with the possible association between mast cells and zzso progression and summarizes some of the most recent data on the zzso The zzso of mast cells around zzso areas is a very old zzso However, the functional significance of such phenomenon is a subject of controversy because of contradictory experimental zzso In this review, two hypotheses are zzso The first, refers on the possibility that the zzso of mast cells is part of a general zzso zzso reaction since, mast cells have been shown to be zzso for some zzso (especially those sensitive to tumor necrosis zzso However, if such hypothesis is correct, one should explain why in most clinical and experimental cases, zzso continue to progress although the high zzso of such zzso system zzso We are therefore brought to consider a second possibility, in which, mast cells products could promote zzso growth and zzso In fact, it is well documented that zzso combined to a range of zzso factors such as zzso or zzso beta is able to promote zzso and that mast cell zzso cause cell structural zzso and loss of the zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso by mast cells is less zzso There is indeed controversial experimental data referring to zzso content within zzso zzso and to zzso proper effect on zzso zzso Finally, this review discuss the mechanisms resulting to mast cell zzso around zzso and more particularly the contribution of zzso zzso
