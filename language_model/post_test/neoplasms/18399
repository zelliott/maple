Our zzso work showed a dramatic zzso between zzso zzso and zzso for stimulation of natural killer cell zzso zzso We aimed to determine the safety profile of zzso when given in combination with zzso and zzso to patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso was given zzso at 175 zzso every 3 zzso zzso was given on day 1 each week (4 zzso initially and 2 zzso zzso in combination with injections of zzso on days 2 and 5 starting in cycle zzso This trial accrued 21 patients with zzso zzso tumors zzso 7; zzso 6; zzso 4; stomach, 2; zzso 1; zzso zzso The zzso component was zzso in zzso of three zzso The zzso toxicity was grade 3 fatigue at the 300 zzso dose level in two zzso The recommended phase II dose was 200 zzso administered zzso There was one complete response in a patient with breast cancer, partial responses in 4 patients zzso 2; zzso zzso and stabilization of disease lasting 3 months or greater zzso in 6 other zzso All but one response occurred in patients with zzso zzso zzso Two zzso patients completed 1 year of zzso Ten patients had progressive zzso There was increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells and increased levels of zzso and several zzso in patients with clinical benefit zzso response, partial response, or zzso but not in patients with progressive zzso zzso in combination with zzso and zzso therefore exhibits an acceptable toxicity profile and has activity in patients with zzso zzso
