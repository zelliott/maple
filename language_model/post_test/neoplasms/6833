zzso zzso zzso that express zzso zzso are currently being evaluated in zzso zzso testing of these zzso has thus far been limited to zzso zzso tumor models since human zzso do not replicate effectively in zzso tumor zzso The effect of the zzso zzso on overall virus potency can therefore not be readily assessed in these zzso Here, a model is described that allows the effective testing of mouse armed zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumor zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso have a high level of zzso in a wide range of zzso tumor zzso The zzso zzso viruses were successfully armed with zzso zzso zzso factor zzso by a novel method which resulted in zzso with a high level of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed an improved level of zzso potency and induced a systemic zzso immune response that was greater than that induced by unarmed parental zzso in zzso zzso tumor zzso Thus, the zzso zzso system described here provides a zzso zzso model for the testing of zzso armed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The model allows evaluation of the impact of virus replication and the host immune response on overall virus potency and enables the generation of zzso data that will be important for guiding the clinical development of these zzso
