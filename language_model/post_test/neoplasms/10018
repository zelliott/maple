The performance of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso determination is evaluated and zzso The fast initial fading of zzso stained zzso with substantial reduction in zzso intensity within about 10 zzso is shown to be related to changes in zzso between cell types when zzso are performed using different zzso light zzso Although low intensity zzso without such zzso was used, the zzso zzso procedure showed large zzso to zzso zzso regarding both mean zzso zzso and zzso of variation zzso The cells in such specimens could be shown to contain the same amount of zzso using scanning zzso zzso and the differing zzso values therefore probably represent zzso in zzso zzso zzso stained with zzso zzso after zzso treatment showed very small zzso in mean zzso value between zzso and also much lower zzso than in zzso stained zzso The results indicate that with proper internal standards this procedure would allow the detection of zzso in DNA content in the order of zzso
