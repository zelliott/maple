The underlying risk of zzso zzso zzso is unclear in patients undergoing zzso cell transplantation zzso As such, these patients should still be considered at risk for development of zzso due to factors such as their underlying zzso and the marked inflammatory state that develops from zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize the zzso of zzso in patients undergoing zzso zzso chart review of patients from the Indiana University Stem Cell zzso Unit treated between January 1, 2008, and May 24, zzso Patients were older than 18 years and had undergone zzso The primary objective was to analyze the zzso of zzso in patients undergoing zzso zzso versus zzso zzso Secondary objectives included documentation of zzso treatment strategies and time to occurrence of zzso Of the zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso 14 developed zzso zzso whereas 5 of the 180 patients who underwent zzso zzso developed zzso zzso P zzso zzso The median time to development of zzso from admission for zzso was 12 days in the zzso zzso arm versus 19 days in the zzso zzso arm zzso zzso zzso The most commonly used zzso treatment strategy was zzso (12 out of 19 zzso This study illustrates that zzso does occur rarely in patients who have undergone zzso The optimal treatment regimen in this population requires further zzso Until a reliable protocol for treatment and evidence for risk factors are established, providers should be vigilant for occurrence of zzso in these zzso
