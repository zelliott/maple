In cell and tissue samples, water is normally three orders of magnitude more abundant than other zzso Thus, water suppression is required in the acquisition of zzso zzso to overcome the dynamic range problem and to recover zzso that overlap with the broad baseline of the strong water zzso However, the zzso cellular environment often zzso water suppression and the strong zzso of water to membrane lipids interferes with the zzso detection of membrane associated zzso zzso The widely used water suppression techniques including zzso and double zzso field zzso selective echo result in more than a zzso reduction in membrane associated zzso components in zzso zzso of cells and zzso compared to zzso zzso acquired in the absence of water zzso A water suppression technique based on the combination of selective zzso zzso and zzso field zzso is proposed to use in the acquisition of high resolution zzso zzso zzso of tissue specimens and cell zzso This pulse sequence methodology enables efficient water suppression for intact cells and tissue samples and eliminates signal loss from cellular zzso
