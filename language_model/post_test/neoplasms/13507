We have isolated from a human prostate zzso library a zzso zzso a novel member of the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso designated zzso is capable of interacting with another member of the family, zzso zzso zzso was cloned into a bacterial expression system, and the zzso protein was zzso to zzso from bacterial zzso by a combination of zzso column and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of the 20 zzso zzso acids confirmed that the sequence of the zzso protein is identical to the sequence deduced from the zzso zzso structural data have been obtained using circular zzso and zzso zzso and equilibrium zzso zzso These results show that zzso is a zzso predominantly zzso zzso zzso of calcium to a solution of zzso changes the zzso intensity of the zzso indicating that zzso is capable of binding calcium zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso indicates the existence of two zzso sites with apparent affinities on the order of 5 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of calcium results in zzso changes and exposure of zzso surfaces on the zzso Using a zzso zzso we have detected differences in the expression level of zzso zzso in various zzso The highest levels were found in zzso and zzso zzso gene expression appears to be zzso in some tumor zzso compared to expression in their normal zzso
