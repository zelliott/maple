zzso patients are prone to develop invasive pulmonary zzso zzso zzso and high mortality rates are seen in those patients who receive subsequent zzso zzso Standard zzso regimens often fail to completely eradicate zzso which then warrants an aggressive surgical zzso 

We performed a retrospective chart review of 13 zzso patients who were considered to have zzso and who underwent surgery between 1988 and zzso 

Twelve patients had a zzso zzso and one patient had breast zzso The diagnosis of zzso was based on a chest zzso zzso scan in all zzso A zzso diagnosis of zzso was made in three patients, and zzso in one patient, by zzso zzso Before surgery, seven patients received chemotherapy, one patient underwent bone zzso zzso and five patients received a combination of chemotherapy and bone zzso zzso zzso included cough zzso fever zzso zzso zzso and zzso of breath zzso Three patients zzso were zzso The mean zzso absolute zzso count was zzso zzso zzso zzso operations were performed, zzso 12 wedge zzso 4 zzso and 1 zzso One patient also underwent zzso for invasive zzso and one patient underwent zzso to zzso an zzso brain zzso zzso pathology revealed zzso in 13 zzso invasive zzso in 2 zzso zzso in 1, and diffuse zzso zzso in zzso zzso complications included the zzso operative bleeding requiring zzso three zzso prolonged air zzso two zzso death because of zzso failure, one zzso and death because of overwhelming zzso zzso one zzso Seven zzso patients underwent further zzso treatment with no zzso zzso After a mean follow-up of 12 months, five zzso patients are alive and seven zzso have died without evidence of zzso and/or zzso 

zzso zzso in combination with zzso agents, is a safe and effective form of therapy for invasive zzso It prevents recurrence and allows for subsequent zzso zzso
