The relative zzso potency of oral and intramuscular zzso was evaluated in a zzso crossover comparison of graded single doses in patients with chronic pain due to zzso When both duration and intensity of analgesia are considered zzso zzso oral zzso was zzso as potent as the intramuscular zzso This is a high zzso zzso relative potency ratio compared with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso well with the results of recent studies which have determined the oral zzso intramuscular zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and intramuscular zzso were also compared in a similar patient zzso Like zzso zzso retained at least 1/2 of its zzso activity when administered zzso We zzso that the high zzso relative potency ratios of zzso and zzso relative to zzso and its zzso are not due to more efficient zzso after oral administration, but rather that zzso at position 3 in zzso and zzso protects these drugs from rapid zzso zzso
