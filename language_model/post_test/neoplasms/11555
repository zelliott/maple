The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a zzso multidisciplinary intervention targeted to maintain the overall quality of life zzso which is more comprehensive than zzso distress, of patients undergoing radiation therapy for zzso zzso 

zzso therapy patients with advanced cancer and an estimated zzso survival rate of zzso to 50% were randomly assigned to either an zzso structured multidisciplinary intervention arm or a standard care zzso The eight 90-minute sessions addressed the five zzso of zzso including zzso physical, zzso spiritual, and social zzso The primary end point of maintaining overall zzso was assessed by a zzso linear analog scale zzso zzso zzso of Assessment or modified Spitzer zzso zzso was assessed at zzso week 4 (end of multidisciplinary zzso week 8, and week zzso 

Of the 103 participants, overall zzso at week 4 was maintained by the patients in the intervention zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso at week 4 significantly decreased for patients in the control group zzso zzso zzso This change reflected a 3-point increase from baseline in the intervention group and a zzso decrease from baseline in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso participants maintained their zzso and controls gradually returned to baseline by the end of the zzso follow-up zzso 

Although intervention participants maintained and actually improved their zzso during radiation therapy, control participants experienced a significant decrease in their zzso Thus, a structured multidisciplinary intervention can help maintain or even improve zzso in patients with advanced cancer who are undergoing cancer zzso
