zzso zzso virus with zzso cell specificity may provide a versatile tool either for direct zzso of cancer cells or for the targeted transfer of genes zzso zzso zzso We report the expression of a single chain zzso on the surface of zzso enveloped zzso zzso The zzso zzso an envelope zzso which is not required for viral infection and zzso was replaced by zzso fusion molecules carrying a single chain zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in a high percentage of human zzso Two fusion proteins carrying the single chain zzso at different zzso positions were expressed and exposed at the envelope of the corresponding zzso zzso The construct containing the zzso at the site of the zzso loop of the zzso was able to bind zzso zzso This is the first report of replacement of a zzso virus envelope protein by a specific recognition structure and represents a first step towards zzso the host cell zzso of the zzso
