zzso evidence indicates that aspirin use is associated with reduced risks of colon cancer and possibly several other zzso including prostate and breast zzso Recent results from the Women's Health Study zzso trial indicate that long-term use of zzso aspirin zzso zzso every other day) does not substantially reduce cancer zzso However, the potential effect of long-term daily use of higher doses of aspirin on cancer zzso remains zzso 

We examined associations between long-term daily use of zzso aspirin zzso or zzso 325 zzso and both overall cancer zzso and zzso of 10 types of cancer among zzso men and zzso women participating in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition zzso a relatively elderly zzso Aspirin use was reported at enrollment in zzso and updated in 1997, 1999, and zzso zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso was used to calculate rate ratios zzso 

During follow-up through June 2003, zzso men and zzso women were diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso or zzso 5 zzso daily use of zzso zzso compared with no use, was associated with lower overall cancer zzso in men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso significantly lower overall cancer zzso in women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso cancer zzso per 100,000 zzso zzso to the age zzso of men and women in the zzso with long-term daily aspirin use and no aspirin use was 1858 and zzso respectively, among men and zzso and zzso respectively, among zzso zzso daily aspirin use was associated with lower zzso of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso among men and women zzso and prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso significant lower risk of female breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso daily use of zzso aspirin may be associated with modestly reduced overall cancer zzso in populations among whom zzso zzso and breast zzso are zzso
