zzso zzso factors with zzso zzso domain zzso zzso play key roles in zzso Some members of the zzso family are negative regulators of the zzso signaling zzso We have previously cloned and characterized human zzso zzso a zzso with zzso and zzso Another group mapped zzso gene to human zzso zzso and reported almost ubiquitous expression of zzso zzso zzso in human normal zzso Here, expression of zzso zzso was investigated by using zzso specific probe, which zzso to zzso human zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso zzso was relatively highly expressed in adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fetal zzso and zzso In adult heart, zzso zzso was more highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso than in zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and in 4 cases out of 8 cases of primary gastric zzso zzso zzso was relatively highly expressed in a gastric cancer cell line zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was significantly zzso in 7 out of 18 cases of primary zzso tumors, in 4 out of 9 cases of primary breast cancer, in 4 out of 14 cases of primary kidney tumors, and also in some cases of primary lung and prostate zzso zzso gene might be one of zzso genes on human zzso zzso
