zzso therapy is the most widely used treatment for cancer, but it causes the side effect of zzso due to zzso zzso We examined the protective effect of zzso in zzso mice after abdominal zzso by evaluation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Mouse colon cancer zzso cells were zzso injected at the flank of zzso mice to generate zzso The zzso mice were treated with abdominal radiation at 5 and 10 zzso and with zzso at 200 zzso body weight per day for 1 d before zzso The changes in zzso zzso were evaluated 12 h and zzso d after zzso To assess the effect of the combination treatment on the cancer growth, the tumor volume was determined at sacrifice before tumor overgrowth zzso 

zzso significantly decreased the number of zzso zzso compared with that in the zzso group 12 h after 5 zzso zzso zzso of zzso changes showed that zzso ameliorated zzso zzso changes such as decreased zzso survival, zzso zzso and increased length of the zzso zzso zzso d after 10 zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso group exhibited more zzso zzso cells in the zzso than the zzso control group, and zzso depths were greater in the zzso group than in the zzso control zzso The mean weight of the zzso tumors was reduced in the group treated with zzso and radiation compared with the control zzso 

zzso had a protective effect on zzso damage induced by zzso and delayed tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso is a useful candidate for preventing zzso zzso damage in cancer zzso
