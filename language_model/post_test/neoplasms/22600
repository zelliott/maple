The present study reports a new three-dimensional zzso zzso platform capable of rapid isolation and detection of cancer cells from a large sample volume zzso zzso zzso by utilizing magnetic zzso zzso Several zzso including a zzso zzso incubator for the magnetic beads to capture cancer cells, a zzso control module for sample transportation and a zzso acid amplification module for genetic zzso are integrated into this zzso With the incorporation of zzso magnetic zzso target cancer cells can be specifically recognized and zzso onto the surface of the zzso magnetic zzso by utilizing a swirling effect generated by the new zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso the magnetic complexes via the incorporation of an external magnet and a zzso control zzso which washes away any zzso waste zzso Experimental results show that over zzso of the target cancer cells can be isolated from a large volume of zzso within 10 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the expressed genes associated with zzso and lung cancer cells can also be successfully amplified by using the zzso zzso acid amplification zzso More importantly, the detection limit of the developed system is found to be 5 zzso zzso cells zzso for the target cancer cells, indicating that this proposed zzso system may be adapted for clinical use for the early detection of cancer zzso zzso the proposed zzso zzso system incorporated with zzso beads may provide a promising automated platform for the rapid isolation and detection of cancer cells with a high zzso
