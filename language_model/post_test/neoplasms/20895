zzso zzso infection is considered to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, particularly those with zzso zzso drugs are often given zzso or to patients with persistent zzso 

The objective of this review was to assess the effect of zzso drugs in cancer patients with zzso 

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register zzso zzso zzso (to September 1997) and the reference lists of zzso We searched the proceedings of the zzso General Meeting of the zzso (from 1990 to zzso and the 7th European Congress of Clinical zzso and zzso Diseases zzso and contacted researchers in the zzso 

zzso trials of zzso B, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso compared with zzso or no treatment in cancer patients with zzso 

Two zzso independently assessed trial zzso zzso quality and zzso zzso 

Twenty-five trials involving zzso patients were zzso In 19 trials, zzso or later treatment with zzso drugs had no effect on mortality zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso Only zzso showed a significant benefit zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso based on seven trials, but the studies were small and the difference in number of deaths was only zzso zzso it would be necessary to treat 59 patients zzso confidence zzso 37 to zzso with an zzso drug to prevent one case of zzso invasion in surviving patients, although only zzso and zzso showed a clear beneficial zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso and the need for additional zzso therapy, but there was zzso across the zzso 

zzso zzso or later therapy with zzso drugs in cancer patients with zzso does not appear to have a beneficial effect on mortality and only a modest effect on zzso zzso
