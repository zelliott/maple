zzso studies are among the main study designs for investigating the effect of environmental zzso on disease zzso and are now becoming more frequently used to examine the influence of genetic zzso zzso a zzso design to examine genetic exposure would seem appropriate as the main problems of zzso studies, those of bias and zzso are more easily zzso However, they do not have a strong image and are thought to provide too many zzso findings as a result of chance, bias or zzso This criticism has often been zzso especially for many early studies based on small numbers of poorly defined cases that were compared to convenient groups of local zzso New zzso study designs that account for these problems have been suggested, including the transmission zzso zzso However, the traditional format of zzso studies may be improved by incorporating zzso refinements developed over the past 30 years in environmental zzso The present chapter attempts to outline these issues and to provide guidelines for the selection of cases and controls and for the analysis of genetic data from zzso zzso zzso zzso study designs will also be zzso Finally, a comprehensive analysis approach to zzso and zzso interaction is zzso
