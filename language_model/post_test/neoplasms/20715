The ends of linear zzso are capped by specialized zzso structures termed zzso zzso comprise tracts of zzso zzso repeat sequences that, in combination with specific zzso protect against degradation, zzso and zzso fusion zzso Due to the polarity of conventional DNA zzso a net loss of zzso sequences occurs at each cell zzso It has been proposed that this cumulative zzso erosion is a limiting factor in zzso capacity and elicits a signal for the onset of cellular zzso To zzso beyond the zzso checkpoint, cells must restore zzso zzso This can be achieved by zzso an zzso with zzso zzso This zzso is absent in differentiated zzso zzso but zzso zzso has been detected in most zzso Much investigative effort is focusing on zzso dynamics with a view to possible manipulation of cellular zzso zzso In this article, we review the role of zzso and zzso in zzso and tumor zzso and we discuss the potential use of zzso in diagnosis and zzso
