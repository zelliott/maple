Most zzso drugs kill cancer cells by indirectly zzso zzso zzso after creating zzso damage to DNA or zzso which accounts for their toxicity toward normal zzso We seek to target cancer cells by directly zzso checkpoint regulators without creating such zzso Here, we show that zzso selectively zzso zzso in cancer cells without causing the death of zzso cells in zzso This unusual selectivity against cancer cells is preceded by zzso of zzso checkpoint and selective induction of zzso a regulator of zzso zzso This study suggests direct checkpoint zzso as a strategy against zzso
