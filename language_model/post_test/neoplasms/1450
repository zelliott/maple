To assess and compare the usefulness of zzso zzso zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso for the differentiation between benign and zzso in various zzso 

We examined 38 consecutive patients with various tumors, including seven patients with brain tumors, two with oral cavity zzso two with zzso cancer, six with lung cancer, 11 with bone zzso nine with soft tissue tumors, and one with zzso zzso and zzso were performed from five minutes and 40 minutes, respectively, after injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by the standardized zzso value zzso and were analyzed in according to the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso in zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and was also significantly larger than that in benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in all the zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso According to the receiver operating characteristic zzso analysis, the area under the zzso curve for zzso was zzso and with no significant difference compared to zzso with the area of zzso 

This study demonstrated that zzso is similar to zzso in differentiation between zzso and benign zzso in various zzso
