zzso play important and diverse roles in zzso Most obvious functions are storage of chemical energy, provision of structural support of biological zzso and zzso All these cellular processes are of critical relevance to cells which undergo zzso cancer progression and zzso Thus, it is likely that certain classes of lipids are reflective for the cellular physiology in cancer cells and zzso Here we discuss key roles of lipids involved in cancer as well as challenges for development of novel zzso zzso Special emphasis will be given to mass zzso based analysis of zzso Such technology has been successfully used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of lipids with very different zzso Comparative analysis, often in zzso zzso and either in zzso zzso by liquid zzso stage mass zzso or targeted zzso by tandem mass zzso fashion yields vast zzso of zzso zzso (such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso statistics zzso components analysis, machine learning and zzso zzso are next used to identify variations in individual zzso species and/or to lower dimensions for zzso and grouping of cases and zzso As a result surrogate zzso or zzso markers are identified which form the basis for functional validation as well as potential translation to alternative zzso zzso
