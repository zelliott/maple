zzso zzso has been shown to increase zzso counts in several animal models and to enhance zzso in zzso In order to investigate the possible relationship between zzso and zzso serum zzso levels in patients with zzso counts zzso or zzso 6 zzso zzso were measured using an zzso zzso A cohort of healthy volunteers with normal zzso counts was used to establish a control mean serum zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with primary zzso had a mean serum zzso level not significantly different from zzso In comparison, serum zzso levels of patients with zzso zzso were significantly greater than controls zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso P zzso zzso Although no significant correlation was observed between the degree of serum zzso zzso and the height of the zzso count in any individual, elevated serum zzso was highly correlated with zzso zzso
