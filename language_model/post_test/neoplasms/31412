The use of zzso in the zzso of cancer patients requires an accurate patient positioning in order to exploit its potential zzso Using CT images as the basis for the setup zzso offers the advantage of a high zzso resolution in combination with a zzso accurate, zzso zzso Before each fraction a single CT slice is acquired at the zzso level after the positioning zzso This single slice is registered to the planning CT cube using automated image registration zzso Thus any zzso translation or rotation can be detected and zzso The registration process involves the zzso of the zzso data, the calculation of an energy function, and the zzso of this energy zzso Several data zzso functions as well as zzso zzso were zzso CT studies with a head phantom were performed in which defined translations and zzso were simulated by moving a zzso treatment zzso Different slice thicknesses and anatomical sites were studied to investigate their potential influence on the registration zzso The accuracy of the registration was found to be a fraction of a zzso size for suitable combinations of zzso (typically better than zzso zzso A significant zzso of the registration accuracy on the CT slice thickness and the anatomical site was found (the accuracy ranges from zzso zzso to zzso zzso depending on the zzso The calculation time is zzso on the used zzso and the magnitude of the setup zzso For the standard combination of zzso as proposed by the authors zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso the typical calculation time is about 20 s for a Sun zzso zzso Taking into account the mechanical accuracy of the setup device zzso zzso the registration of CT images is thus a useful tool for detecting and zzso any significant error in the patient zzso
