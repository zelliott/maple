zzso zzso composed of T cells engineered to express a zzso zzso zzso zzso offer an attractive strategy for treatment of human zzso However, zzso have a fixed zzso specificity such that only one zzso zzso zzso can be targeted, limiting the efficacy that can be achieved because of zzso zzso zzso For this reason, a more generalized and effective application of zzso therapy would benefit from the capability to produce large panels of zzso against many known zzso In this study, we show a novel strategy to extend the recognition specificity potential of a zzso zzso population, allowing flexible approaches to redirect T cells against various zzso Our strategy employs a zzso immune zzso zzso composed of an zzso zzso linked to an zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso T cells recognized and bound exclusively to cancer cells zzso with specific zzso zzso The versatility afforded by zzso permitted sequential or simultaneous targeting of a combination of distinct zzso Together, our findings show that a platform of universal zzso specificity can significantly extend conventional zzso approaches, permitting the tailored generation of T cells of unlimited zzso specificity for improving the effectiveness of adoptive zzso zzso for zzso
