zzso resistance describes a complex zzso whose zzso feature is resistance to a wide range of structurally unrelated zzso compounds, many of which are zzso zzso This zzso occurs frequently in zzso cell lines and zzso zzso selected for resistance to a single zzso zzso cellular zzso of the drugs involved appears to account for the zzso This may be a consequence of reduced drug influx, increased drug zzso or zzso A wide variety of zzso changes have been identified in zzso resistant cell lines, the most consistent of which is the increased expression of zzso a zzso high molecular weight, plasma membrane zzso The level of zzso expression zzso with the degree of drug resistance in a variety of different cell zzso In a number of zzso resistant cell lines, zzso of zzso results from gene zzso While the function of zzso is unknown, independent lines of evidence support the notion that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso the zzso resistance zzso zzso levels of zzso expression have been detected in some biopsy specimens from patients with zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso resistant zzso cells can occur in human zzso The presence of such cells may affect the outcome of zzso
