The purpose of this study is to evaluate the improved method of zzso infusion therapy of zzso zzso with zzso under the zzso zzso state for various zzso solid zzso Most patients were zzso with no other therapeutic options, recurrence after zzso or patients do not respond to common zzso The new method zzso zzso II zzso to induce hypertension zzso approximately zzso zzso above zzso for zzso zzso This method was successfully applied to zzso liver cancer, zzso massive zzso cell zzso pancreatic and other abdominal solid zzso This zzso hypertension resulted in remarkably enhanced tumor delivery accompanied by improved therapeutic response, and a shorter time to achieve 50% zzso of tumor size with least zzso We demonstrated clinically zzso improved therapy for various advanced solid tumors with SX by zzso the tumor blood flow zzso This is the first clinical proof that zzso of vascular zzso can uniquely accomplish enhanced tumor selective delivery of zzso drugs and thus yielded better clinical zzso
