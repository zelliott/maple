We examined the role of the zzso nucleation promoters neural zzso syndrome protein zzso and zzso in cell zzso in response to zzso growth factor zzso a key regulator in zzso cell zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso formation and increases zzso formation, whereas zzso zzso has no zzso However, simultaneous zzso of both proteins results in the formation of large jagged zzso with zzso properties and increased zzso zzso This suggests that another zzso nucleation activity is at work in zzso cells in response to zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the jagged zzso in double zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso the zzso whereas zzso of zzso blocked the formation of these zzso Increased zzso activity, which stimulates zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso cells and was shown to be required for the zzso zzso zzso These data show that coordinate regulation between the zzso family and zzso proteins controls the balance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso
