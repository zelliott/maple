zzso zzso cell lines with previously characterized zzso are considered to be the best positive controls for zzso We assessed the zzso of using zzso cell line zzso as positive controls for zzso performed on zzso clinical zzso We compared zzso slides and zzso zzso from cultured zzso cell lines for intensity and pattern of zzso Also, zzso preservation was assessed over a zzso period, using a panel of 16 primary zzso and 12 zzso cell zzso A three-step alkaline zzso procedure was used except when in a single instance the zzso method was zzso If appropriately zzso both preparations showed excellent correlation with no decrease in zzso during the zzso testing zzso zzso slides from clinical samples are ideal for zzso because internal negative controls can be performed for each zzso We recommend the use of zzso for positive controls because of the lower zzso
