One of the main problems in clinical zzso is an acquired cellular drug zzso Special attention deserves the zzso resistance phenomenon zzso involving tumors which become resistant to a wide spectrum of zzso drugs to which they have never been zzso Several mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon have been zzso Among them is the increased expression of the zzso gene which encodes the plasma membrane zzso zzso This zzso is an zzso zzso zzso pump of wide zzso It seems to have a normal zzso function but in some tumors resistant to chemotherapy its expression is zzso In cell lines the increased expression of zzso is correlated with a decreased zzso and retention of drugs inside the zzso In addition to zzso at least two other mechanisms of zzso resistance have been zzso a decreased expression and changes in the zzso activity of zzso II zzso and changes in zzso zzso zzso Through zzso and molecular methods researchers continue to look for a correlation between zzso tumors and changes in the known zzso zzso These studies suggest that several factors are involved in the cellular drug resistance observed in human tumors, and probably are interacting between zzso In clinical practice, the need of controlling zzso phenomena has led to the creation of alternate therapeutic zzso
