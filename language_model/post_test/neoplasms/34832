DC zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso agent approved for the treatment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The beads have previously been shown to actively zzso zzso charged drugs, such as zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso In order to zzso the release zzso and predict the in zzso zzso of drug zzso beads zzso two zzso methods were zzso The first, an application of the zzso dissolution method Type II - zzso enables study of the complete zzso of loaded DC zzso in less than 4 zzso allowing relatively rapid comparison to be made between different products and zzso zzso data obtained using this method were fitted to first order zzso (R zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso shown to increase with the total surface area of the beads exposed to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated adopting the zzso diffusion model, which predicted slow zzso rates under zzso zzso The second method involved the use of a zzso where the drug experiences an element of diffusion through a zzso zzso This method was developed to resemble the in zzso situation in zzso procedures more zzso Slow release of zzso from DC zzso with zzso over 1,500 h were predicted for all size ranges using a slow release zzso A strong linear relationship was found between the release data from zzso and zzso data obtained from patients treated with DC zzso loaded with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicated a Level A in zzso zzso correlation zzso for the first 24 h post zzso Both systems developed were automated and good zzso was obtained for all samples, demonstrating the usefulness of these zzso techniques for product development and comparative zzso
