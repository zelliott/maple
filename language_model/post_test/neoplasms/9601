The use of zzso treatment zzso for external beam zzso such as intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso and zzso beam therapy is zzso This review focuses on the changes in the dose distribution and the impact on radiation related risks for long-term cancer zzso We compare conventional zzso zzso and zzso beam therapy based on published treatment planning studies as well as published zzso and zzso Carlo simulations of zzso dose zzso Physical dose parameters describing the dose distribution in the target volume, the conformity index, the dose distribution in zzso at risk, and the dose distribution in zzso zzso respectively, are extracted from the treatment planning zzso Measured zzso dose zzso are presented as the dose equivalent as a function of distance from the treatment zzso Data in the literature clearly shows that, compared with conventional zzso zzso improves the dose distribution in the target volume, which may increase the probability of tumor zzso zzso also seems to increase the zzso dose distribution, as well as the zzso zzso volume, although the data is not consistent, leading to a potentially increased risk of radiation induced secondary zzso while decreasing the dose to normal zzso close to the target volume, reducing the normal tissue complication zzso zzso show no or only minor advantage on the dose distribution in the target volume and the conformity index compared to zzso However, the data consistently shows that zzso beam therapy substantially decreases the zzso average dose compared to the other two zzso It is also clear that zzso provide an improved dose distribution in zzso zzso compared to conventional zzso and zzso zzso and zzso beam therapy may significantly improve tumor control for cancer patients and quality of life for long-term cancer zzso
