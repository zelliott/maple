To better define zzso parameters related to tumor response in superficial zzso treated with combined zzso and radiation zzso 

Patients were zzso to receive one or two zzso treatments per week with zzso given during each week of zzso zzso was given for 60 zzso with treatments begun within 1 zzso following zzso Power was increased to patient tolerance or normal tissue temperature of zzso degrees zzso zzso was generally given 5 times per week with doses prescribed to normal tissue tolerance zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso was used with temperatures obtained every 5 zzso 

One hundred zzso individual treatment fields containing 1 or more tumor zzso were completely zzso The complete and overall response rates were zzso and zzso zzso zzso percent of all treatment fields zzso of responding zzso remained controlled at 2 zzso zzso analysis revealed that the cumulative minutes that the temperature achieved by zzso of the measured tumor sites zzso was zzso or zzso zzso degrees C, tumor zzso tumor volume, and radiation dose were significantly associated with complete tumor zzso The complete response rate was not significantly affected by the number of zzso treatments given per zzso The zzso of clinically significant complications was zzso 

These results support the usefulness of the cumulative minute system in describing zzso zzso The significance of zzso variables with regard to tumor response strongly supports the contention that zzso can be a useful adjunct to zzso for the local control of zzso
