zzso zzso inflammation is recognized as an important factor contributing to zzso and age-related zzso In zzso levels of zzso zzso decrease during the zzso process; zzso are known to decrease systemic inflammation by zzso inflammatory zzso synthesis in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels have been associated with zzso barrier zzso The zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to increase zzso zzso PA zzso 

We supplemented the diet of zzso zzso female mice with zzso for 11 months, while the controls received no zzso Survival rates were compared using zzso survival zzso zzso mice survived significantly longer than controls zzso moreover, skin zzso and tumors were more common in the control zzso We then analyzed inflammatory and zzso conditions by measuring several markers using zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice showed altered zzso zzso gene expression of several zzso zzso bacterial zzso The zzso zzso of zzso but not of zzso fatty zzso were significantly higher in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso function was also better in zzso mice, with increased zzso zzso and better maintenance of tight zzso Changes in gene expression levels were evaluated using the zzso mouse DNA zzso zzso administration also zzso the expression of zzso and zzso genes and gene expression levels in zzso zzso mice resembled those in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrated increased longevity in mice following zzso treatment with zzso possibly due to the suppression of chronic zzso inflammation in the colon induced by higher PA zzso This indicates that zzso of specific zzso may be an easy approach for improving zzso health and increasing zzso Further studies are required to clarify its effectiveness in zzso
