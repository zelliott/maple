In the present article we describe the zzso in the mouse of 2 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso tumor 1 zzso zzso The newly described zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso complex restricted zzso T zzso zzso capable of killing zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso zzso has been previously described as a zzso zzso zzso Both zzso are zzso zzso as zzso with incomplete Freund zzso induced poor zzso zzso In contrast, when coated onto zzso cells zzso both peptides readily induced zzso zzso However, these zzso zzso were of low zzso and unable to recognize zzso tumor cells in zzso and to protect against tumor challenge in zzso In contrast, vaccination with zzso coated with peptides derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso that recognized zzso tumor cells and protected against tumor growth in zzso These data show that although DC vaccination readily zzso zzso against zzso zzso these zzso did not display zzso activity in zzso and in zzso This suggests that tolerance to the 2 zzso zzso interferes with the generation of protective zzso immunity in zzso
