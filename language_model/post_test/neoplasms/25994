zzso injection of naked zzso DNA either zzso or zzso zzso strong, zzso zzso and zzso immune responses to the zzso zzso by the gene zzso In the present study, we used gene vaccination with naked zzso DNA to induce zzso immune responses to tumor associated zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) is an ideal candidate for cancer vaccines because it belongs to a family of genes that are expressed in a number of human tumors of various zzso types but not in normal adult zzso except for the zzso and because both zzso and zzso immune responses against zzso zzso were detected in tumor zzso zzso administration of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso level of zzso zzso was induced by intramuscular injection of zzso Also, zzso injection of zzso was capable of generating zzso zzso with zzso zzso tumor cells, zzso Most of the mice (8 out of 10) zzso with zzso rejected the challenge of zzso tumor cells, compared with control animals most of which developed zzso This suggests that zzso DNA vaccination could provide a novel zzso of zzso
