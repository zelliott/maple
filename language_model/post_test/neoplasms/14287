It is not yet known whether DNA zzso levels can be used to accurately predict age across a broad spectrum of human zzso and cell types, nor whether the resulting age prediction is a biologically meaningful zzso 

I developed a zzso predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA zzso age of most zzso and cell zzso The zzso which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 zzso DNA zzso array zzso encompassing 51 healthy zzso and cell zzso I found that DNA zzso age has the following zzso first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced zzso stem zzso second, it zzso with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly zzso measure of age zzso and, fourth, it is zzso to zzso zzso Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 zzso showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age zzso with an average of 36 zzso Low zzso of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA zzso age in breast zzso Finally, I characterize the 353 zzso sites that together form an aging clock in terms of zzso states and tissue zzso 

I propose that DNA zzso age measures the cumulative effect of an zzso maintenance zzso This novel zzso clock can be used to address a host of questions in zzso biology, cancer and aging zzso
