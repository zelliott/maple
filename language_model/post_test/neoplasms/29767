By means of indirect zzso zzso tests with rabbit zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated on 5 of 7 cultured cell lines originating from various cancer zzso zzso of zzso tests with normal human zzso with zzso confirmed the presence of zzso on these zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso could not be detected under the same experimental conditions on zzso lines established from zzso or leukemia patients or on zzso cell lines established from normal zzso The expression of zzso was also studied on transformed rat cell lines derived from an zzso normal cell line, zzso Transformation of the zzso line by whole DNA or by the zzso zzso zzso map zzso but not by the zzso zzso zzso map zzso of zzso type 12 resulted in expression of zzso on the cell zzso The transformed cells with zzso showed an in zzso growth pattern characteristic of that seen in zzso zzso this observation indicates that zzso expression is closely associated with zzso transformation of the zzso
