Target of zzso zzso functions within the cell as a zzso of information from various sources, including growth factors, energy sensors, and zzso sensors, as well as components of the cell regulating growth and zzso zzso zzso function mimics zzso acid, and to some extent, growth factor deprivation and has a zzso effect on zzso cells in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso its namesake zzso leads to zzso This property has been exploited successfully with the use of zzso and its derivatives as a therapeutic agent in the prevention of organ rejection after transplantation with relatively mild side effects when compared to other zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation has also recently been exploited in the therapeutic application of zzso to drug zzso zzso for zzso These zzso significantly reduce the amount of zzso zzso that results from zzso vascular smooth muscle zzso In cancer, the effect of blocking zzso function on zzso growth and disease progression is currently of major interest and is the basis for a number of ongoing clinical zzso However, different cell types and zzso respond differently to zzso zzso and zzso is clearly not zzso for all types of cancer cells in zzso or in zzso As the molecular details of how zzso functions and the targets of zzso activity are further zzso zzso and tissue specific functions are being identified that zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the reversal of some forms of cellular zzso This review will describe our current understanding of zzso function, describe the current strategies for employing zzso zzso in clinical and zzso development, and outline future strategies for appropriate targets of zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso
