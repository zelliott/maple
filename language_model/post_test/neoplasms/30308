An understanding of the interactions between zzso and biological systems is of significant zzso Studies aimed at zzso the properties of zzso such as size, shape, chemical zzso surface charge, and composition with zzso zzso biological zzso transportation, and toxicity in both cell culture and animal experiments are under zzso These fundamental studies will provide a foundation for engineering the next generation of zzso zzso Here, we provide rationales for these studies, review the current progress in studies of the interactions of zzso with biological systems, and provide a perspective on the long-term implications of these zzso
