The zzso system zzso degrades 80 - zzso of zzso zzso Cancer cells take advantage of the UPS for their increased growth and decreased zzso cell zzso Thus, the components that make up the UPS represent a diverse group of potential zzso zzso The success of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso not only proved that the zzso is a feasible and valuable zzso target, but also inspired researchers to extensively explore other potential targets of this zzso 

This review provides a broad overview of the UPS and its role in supporting cancer development and zzso especially in aspects of zzso zzso zzso turnover and zzso zzso Also, efforts toward the development of small zzso zzso zzso targeting different steps in this zzso for cancer treatment are reviewed and zzso 

Whereas some of the targets in the zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been well-established and zzso there remains a large pool of candidates waiting to be zzso Development of zzso targeting the UPS has been largely facilitated by state-of-the-art technologies such as zzso screening and zzso drug design, both of which require a better understanding of the targets of zzso
