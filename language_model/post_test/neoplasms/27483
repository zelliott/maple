Due to large zzso projects more and more genetic information and more and more data about genetic background of various diseases can be zzso By means of zzso thousands to hundreds of thousands of molecular analysis can be performed at a time, zzso under identical conditions, hereby zzso provide a solution to continuously increasing zzso demands from large zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso offer unprecedented opportunities for qualitative and quantitative analysis of gene zzso understanding gene function and detection gene zzso zzso zzso expression profiles will define stages of different tumor types and new zzso zzso in cancer and other zzso For individual patients, more precise diagnosis and risk assessment based on expression profiles are already achievable, leading to more accurate determination of prognosis and more individually tailored zzso zzso will play an important role in zzso of infectious diseases and identification of novel diagnostic and therapeutic zzso zzso application of zzso in clinical practice is not typical today, but their production on an industrial scale and the increased information provided by zzso should assure their entry into clinical practice as very powerful, sensitive, specific and rapid tools of zzso of various zzso
