Over 30 zzso of the zzso gene associated with human zzso have been identified, the majority of which are located within the zzso zzso Here we show that of 22 zzso zzso zzso 18 have elevated zzso activity and signal to zzso in zzso Surprisingly, three zzso have reduced zzso activity towards zzso in zzso but, by zzso zzso in zzso signal to zzso in zzso The structures of wild type and zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with the zzso inhibitor zzso show that the zzso segment is held in an inactive zzso by association with the P zzso The zzso of most zzso to these two regions suggests that disruption of this interaction converts zzso into its active zzso The high activity zzso signal to zzso by directly zzso zzso whereas the impaired activity zzso stimulate zzso by zzso zzso zzso possibly via an zzso or zzso zzso
