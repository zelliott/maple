In a previous analysis, it was shown that zzso area zzso is not a predictor of zzso zzso zzso Here, we zzso evaluated the effects of administering a zzso zzso dose to cancer patients, regardless of zzso 

Twenty-six cancer patients (12 zzso received a fixed zzso dose of 600 zzso given as a zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were measured during the first cycle and analyzed using zzso zzso zzso Data were compared with those obtained in 47 cancer patients (19 zzso who received zzso at a zzso dose of 350 zzso 

The zzso zzso in zzso clearance zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso in relative extent of conversion to zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and in relative extent of zzso zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso were not significantly different between the two dose zzso zzso differences in zzso zzso side effects were also similar between the 600 zzso and 350 zzso groups zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso dosing of zzso does not result in increased zzso zzso and could be safely used to supplant current dosing strategies based on zzso
