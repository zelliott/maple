The possibility of predicting clinical outcome of cancer patients through the analysis of gene expression profiles in the primary tumor is a kind of ideological revolution as the zzso zzso model zzso that the proportion of cells within the primary tumor that actually acquire zzso driving zzso is small; too small to leave its imprint on the gene expression zzso The data collected to date have brought a new paradigm to reality in the zzso field: zzso must at least in part rely on zzso and/or gene regulation events present in the majority of cells which constitute the primary tumor zzso By analyses of differential expression of primary tumors versus zzso or by functional analyses of putative zzso genes in experimental zzso many zzso gene expression events have been identified that correlate with the development of zzso Among genes zzso zzso we find many molecules that are expressed not by the tumor cell itself but by the cells of the zzso as well as genes zzso in the primary tumor that have a principle role in zzso zzso zzso Here we review these concepts and advance hypotheses on how gene expression of the primary tumor and the zzso can favor the spread of the zzso seeds and how this knowledge can provide tools to secondary zzso
