Testing agents in zzso with multiple disease zzso in which the activity of a new treatment may vary between zzso presents statistical and logistical zzso We propose a flexible phase II strategy which includes both analyses for each zzso or stratum and a combined analysis which borrows information from all the patients in the zzso zzso futility analyses are conducted once each zzso or the overall group reaches a specified minimum zzso 

Examples based on a soft tissue zzso phase II trial, which includes multiple zzso and simulation studies, are used to assess the statistical properties of the proposed zzso 

The combined analyses in one phase II trial lead to smaller expected sample sizes when the drug is broadly zzso and to greater statistical power if there is modest activity across multiple strata as compared with conducting several smaller phase II zzso In addition, by retaining the zzso tests, the design allows the identification of zzso for which the agents are most zzso 

To consider phase II testing with multiple biological zzso a strategy which combines both the individual zzso tests and overall combined tests has promising statistical zzso Our results support the appropriate use of statistical borrowing of information in phase II studies in this zzso More broadly, this work fits the paradigm that phase II studies should include as broad a group of patients as zzso reasonable, but incorporate design considerations for zzso of patients with potentially differing responses to zzso
