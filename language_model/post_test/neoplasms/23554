zzso an important treatment zzso in zzso kills cells through induction of zzso zzso However, zzso tumors vary in their response to zzso as a consequence of resistance mechanisms taking place at the molecular zzso It is important to understand these mechanisms of zzso as zzso them may improve the efficacy of zzso In this review, we describe how the zzso factor 1 zzso zzso has a profound effect on the response to zzso The main focus will be on zzso protection of the zzso zzso and on zzso regulation of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This zzso cellular metabolism increases the zzso capacity of tumors, thereby countering the zzso stress caused by zzso From the results of zzso studies and the first clinical phase zzso trials, it can be concluded that targeting zzso and tumor zzso metabolism at several levels reduces the zzso capacity of tumors, affects the tumor zzso and zzso various solid tumors to zzso
