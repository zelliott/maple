An earlier investigation raised concern that some cancer cases might be linked to work at a semiconductor manufacturing zzso The aim of this study was to describe an update of the cancer zzso and mortality of these workers and assess whether workplace zzso contributed to any increased risk of selected zzso 

zzso mortality ratios and zzso zzso ratios were calculated for cancer site groups of a zzso interest in a cohort previously flagged against the National Health Service Central zzso with follow-up extended to the 2007 for deaths and 2006 for cancer zzso Cases of female breast cancer, lung and stomach cancer, and male brain cancer, and a random sample of control subjects individually zzso to the breast cancer cases, were identified from within the cohort zzso and invited to participate via general zzso zzso were estimated using a job exposure zzso developed from a historical hygiene assessment and assigned to job histories obtained from personal interview of subjects (or zzso 

Though the findings were uncertain, there were no excesses of mortality or cancer zzso either overall or for specific cancer sites, suggestive of a workplace zzso zzso zzso analyses comparing 20 cases of breast cancer with 83 matched controls showed no consistent evidence of any relationship with occupational zzso Assessment of zzso of workplace zzso among case sets for other cancer types was limited by the small zzso 

These results do not support earlier concerns about occupational cancer risks among this zzso
