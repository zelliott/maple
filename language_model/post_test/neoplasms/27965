The life history of zzso cells zzso is now established from their origins from bone zzso stem cells, their distribution through blood to the zzso and their movement via zzso zzso to zzso zzso for the initiation of immune zzso zzso stem cells, and occasional stem cells in peripheral blood (about 1 per zzso zzso zzso can give rise both to DC and zzso zzso In addition to stem cells in blood, after short-term culture of zzso cells, three major zzso types of DC can be separated zzso zzso which probably represent the zzso zzso of this cell type; type II cells resemble tissue DC such as zzso cells and type III have a veiled zzso similar to that seen in cells of zzso zzso and in the zzso cells of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso DC cultured from peripheral blood are able to acquire large zzso and process them like zzso cells of the zzso They can also present zzso to stimulate primary zzso responses, a property associated with zzso zzso zzso In zzso DC appear to act as outposts of the immune system, acquire zzso and, particularly in primary responses, carry the zzso to zzso zzso where they initiate zzso zzso In secondary responses, zzso of memory T cells in the periphery and the acquisition of zzso complexes by zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso which stimulate B cell memory, may be more important pathways for immune zzso DC may play a role in the development of many zzso diseases including cancer, zzso and acquired zzso syndrome zzso
