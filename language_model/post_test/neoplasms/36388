Several years ago it was reported that rare zzso zzso zzso occurred more frequently in zzso Caucasian cancer patients than in unaffected zzso Such an association, in theory, could be caused by zzso population zzso Also, in a study clearly relevant to this issue, it was recently reported that significant zzso from zzso equilibrium exist at this locus in a sample of zzso zzso These considerations motivate our population genetic analysis of the zzso zzso From published studies of the zzso zzso zzso which classified zzso into types, we found only small differences in the zzso frequency zzso of samples from various European nations, although there were larger differences among ethnic groups zzso American, zzso and zzso In an analysis of variation of zzso zzso among samples from four European nations, most of the zzso was attributable to molecular methodology, and very samples from four European nations, most of the zzso was attributable to molecular methodology, and very little of the zzso was accounted for by zzso In addition, we showed that mixture of European zzso should result in only minor zzso from expected zzso proportions in a Caucasian database and demonstrated that there was no significant zzso from zzso equilibrium in our zzso zzso
