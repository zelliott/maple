Bone zzso cells include zzso cell lineages and the recently described zzso zzso cells zzso It has been recently zzso that these zzso cells contribute to zzso zzso and different mechanisms have been proposed that account for this zzso Whereas zzso cells may promote zzso zzso through the release of zzso factors or by creating zzso conditions in the zzso zzso that zzso the growth of locally derived blood vessels zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to directly incorporate into nascent blood vessels as bona fide zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The relative contribution of these distinct pathways to zzso zzso is the subject of intense investigation and zzso
