We report cancer zzso zzso and stage zzso among Asians and Pacific Islanders zzso residing in the zzso and note health zzso using the cancer experience of the zzso white population as the zzso zzso New databases added to publicly available zzso software will enable public health researchers to further investigate cancer patterns among zzso zzso 

Cancer diagnoses among zzso groups occurring from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2002 were included from 14 zzso zzso and End zzso zzso Program state and regional zzso cancer zzso covering zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Cancer deaths were included from the seven states that report death information for detailed zzso groups and which cover over zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso Using detailed zzso population data from the 2000 zzso census, we produced zzso rates centered on the census year for Asian zzso Chinese, zzso zzso Native zzso Japanese, zzso Koreans, zzso zzso zzso and zzso State vital records offices do not report zzso deaths separately for zzso zzso zzso and zzso so mortality rates were analyzed only for the remaining zzso zzso 

zzso cancer zzso rates for the zzso groups tended be lower than overall rates for zzso zzso with the exception of Native Hawaiian women (All zzso rate zzso zzso per 100,000 zzso zzso for zzso white zzso Among the zzso groups, overall cancer zzso and death rates were highest for Native Hawaiian and zzso men and women due to high rates for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso among Native Hawaiian zzso zzso of the zzso zzso liver, and stomach among zzso zzso and zzso of the breast and lung among Native Hawaiian and zzso zzso zzso and death rates for zzso of the liver, stomach, and zzso were notably high in several of the zzso groups and exceeded rates generally seen for zzso white men and zzso zzso rates were lowest among Asian zzso and zzso men and women and zzso zzso Asian Indian and zzso men and women also had the lowest cancer death zzso zzso zzso groups had less favorable zzso of stage at diagnosis for certain zzso than zzso zzso 

zzso disparities in cancer zzso or mortality between specific zzso groups in our study and zzso whites zzso zzso were identified for several zzso zzso patterns of stage at diagnosis for zzso of the colon and zzso breast, zzso zzso and prostate suggest a need for cancer control interventions in selected zzso The observed variation in cancer patterns among zzso groups indicates the importance of monitoring these groups zzso as these patterns may provide zzso clues that could be investigated by zzso zzso zzso
