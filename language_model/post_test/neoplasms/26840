To identify changes in plasma zzso levels after zzso zzso zzso of human tumors and to identify the factors that independently predict changes in plasma zzso zzso 

zzso samples were collected from 36 patients at three time zzso before zzso after zzso zzso 48 hours), and at follow-up zzso weeks after zzso Plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso were measured using a multiplex zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed using zzso level as the dependent variable and sample collection, time, age, sex, primary diagnosis, zzso status, zzso site, and zzso type as the independent zzso 

There was a significant increase in the plasma level of zzso after zzso compared with before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed a significant increase after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma levels of zzso zzso and zzso were not significantly changed after zzso zzso resulted in the largest change in zzso level zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso changes, zzso zzso of zzso showed the largest change in zzso 48 hours after zzso zzso followed by zzso of kidney zzso liver zzso and lung zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso type zzso and primary diagnosis zzso were independent zzso of changes to zzso after zzso Age was the only independent predictor of zzso levels after zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of tumors increases plasma levels of zzso and zzso without increasing plasma levels of zzso zzso or zzso
