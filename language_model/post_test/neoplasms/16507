zzso resistance remains an unresolved problem in clinical zzso Over a decade ago genes zzso cellular zzso pumps were shown to zzso resistance to a broad spectrum of zzso unrelated zzso drugs even before the compounds reached their zzso zzso More recently it has become apparent that many drugs induce a common zzso program, such that zzso in this program can also produce zzso zzso However, a thorough evaluation of the contribution of zzso defects to this zzso drug resistant zzso is technically complicated, and this has led to uncertainty about the overall significance of zzso in zzso cell zzso For example, zzso analyses using patient specimens are limited by unknown background zzso in the biopsy material, and zzso using cancer cell lines can be biased by zzso zzso We sought to circumvent these restrictions by utilizing a zzso transgenic cancer model to examine the impact of zzso on treatment zzso Here we discuss potential zzso of cell culture based zzso highlight features of genetically engineered mice as potential model systems, and describe a zzso transgenic mouse model to study drug responses in a series of primary zzso with genetically defined zzso treated at their natural zzso
