The geometric precision of zzso treatments must increase if the objectives of dose escalation and increased disease control are to be zzso There are multiple strategies for increasing the geometric precision of a zzso treatment system, including zzso and setup aids for reducing random and systematic components of setup errors and organ motion zzso zzso more complex strategies can be implemented based on additional information acquired over the course of zzso Generally, these strategies can be divided into two zzso zzso and zzso The strategies that are implemented in the clinic must consider the required geometric precision for a given zzso From this zzso it is possible to select the appropriate strategies and zzso The cost associated with each approach must also be zzso Once a system for delivery has been zzso the residual uncertainties must still be considered in the planning zzso Parallel to the development of strategies for reducing uncertainty, progress is being made in better relating these residual uncertainties to margins for use in treatment zzso This article reviews advances in reducing zzso
