Four cell lines of human zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso origin, resistant to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected in zzso from cultured cells by serial passage in the presence of zzso The resistant zzso were also zzso to zzso zzso zzso and a number of novel zzso including zzso and zzso zzso However, a series of zzso zzso zzso retained full activity against all the resistant zzso as did zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso substitution of zzso is an important zzso of activity against zzso cell lines in zzso
