In the light of experimental results, two zzso studies and one cohort study in a population of zzso zzso area were conducted to confirm whether zzso has any zzso effect on human zzso All participants were interviewed using a zzso questionnaire to obtain the information on zzso cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and zzso zzso In zzso pairs zzso study, zzso had a history of zzso intake compared to zzso of the controls, a statistically significant difference zzso The odds ratio zzso for cancer in relation to zzso intake was zzso In extended zzso study with 1987 pairs, the zzso for cancer were zzso in fresh zzso extract users, zzso in white zzso extract users, zzso in white zzso extract users, zzso in white zzso powder users, and zzso in red zzso zzso Those who took fresh zzso zzso fresh zzso juice, and white zzso tea, however, did not show decrease in the zzso Overall, the risk decreased as the frequency and duration of zzso intake zzso With respect to the site of cancer, the zzso for zzso of the lip, oral zzso zzso zzso stomach, zzso liver, zzso zzso lung and zzso were significantly reduced by zzso zzso Smokers with zzso intake showed lower zzso for zzso of zzso lip, oral cavity and zzso and liver than those without zzso zzso In 5 zzso zzso up cohort study conducted in the zzso zzso area, zzso zzso zzso had significantly lower risk than zzso As for the type of zzso cancer risk significantly decreased among zzso of fresh zzso zzso alone or together with other zzso zzso Among 24 red zzso zzso no cancer death occurred during the follow-up zzso The risk for stomach and lung zzso was significantly reduced by zzso zzso showing a statistically significant zzso relationship in each follow-up zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso Meyer has been established as zzso specific cancer zzso having dose response zzso These results warrant that zzso extracts and its synthetic derivatives should be examined for their preventive effect on various types of human zzso
