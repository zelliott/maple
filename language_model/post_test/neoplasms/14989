The aim of the present study was to examine whether patients with diabetes in Scotland using insulin zzso have a greater cancer risk than patients using other types of zzso 

We used a nationwide diabetes clinical database that covers the majority of the Scottish population with diagnosed diabetes, and examined patients with diabetes who were exposed to any insulin therapy between 1 January 2002 and 31 December zzso Among these we defined a fixed cohort based on exposure during a 4 month period in 2003 zzso zzso zzso in whom zzso cases of cancer zzso and a cohort of new insulin users across the period zzso zzso zzso in whom zzso zzso zzso Records from these zzso were linked to cancer registry data up to the end of zzso We used Cox zzso hazards models for survival zzso 

Those receiving any insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso had the same zzso rate for all zzso as those not receiving insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in the fixed zzso The subset of patients using insulin zzso alone zzso zzso zzso had a significantly higher zzso of all zzso than those using other zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and those using insulin zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso had a slightly lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There were important differences in baseline characteristics between these three groups, although the risk ratios were broadly zzso on adjustment for zzso Overall, there was no increase in breast cancer rates associated with insulin zzso use zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso though insulin zzso only users had a higher rate than those using zzso insulin only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Among type 2 diabetic incident insulin users, no significant difference between the three groups was observed with respect to all cancer or breast zzso All the above zzso are adjusted for age, calendar time prior cancer and type of diabetes, as appropriate, and are zzso according to zzso 

Overall, insulin zzso use was not associated with an increased risk of all zzso or zzso zzso in Scotland over a 4 year time zzso Given the overall data, we consider the excess of cases of all zzso and breast cancer in the zzso of insulin zzso only users to more likely reflect allocation bias rather than an effect of insulin zzso zzso
