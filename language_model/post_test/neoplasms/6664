To determine whether zzso zzso affects the outcome of zzso zzso among profoundly (less than zzso zzso cancer patients, the clinical courses of 75 such patients who received zzso therapy with zzso zzso antibiotics were zzso zzso of 34 (85 percent) patients whose zzso count increased to more than zzso during therapy improved, whereas only 12 of 41 (29 percent) patients with no increase in zzso count showed improvement zzso zzso zzso The critical group for further analysis was, therefore, those patients with persistent, profound zzso Among these 41 patients, zzso was associated with a substantially better response rate: eight of 18 (44 percent) improved compared with none of 13 in whom zzso was not detected zzso zzso zzso presence or absence of zzso could not be assessed for the pathogens isolated from the remaining 10 patients because the organisms were exquisitely susceptible to one of the two antibiotics zzso Further evaluation of these persistently zzso patients indicated that zzso appeared critical even when the pathogen was susceptible to both zzso Thus, seven of 11 zzso percent) showed response when the two drugs were synergistic in activity, compared with none of six when zzso was not present zzso zzso zzso These data again demonstrate the importance of zzso recovery to patient response and further indicate that synergistic combinations of antibiotics are indicated for cancer patients with zzso zzso and persistent, profound zzso
