zzso is an zzso cancer zzso whose recently zzso primary structure suggests that zzso is a giant zzso zzso present on the cell surface of tumor zzso Here, we establish a functional link between zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are components of the zzso zzso implicated in the regulation of cell zzso zzso cell proliferation and tumor zzso On the basis of mass zzso and zzso zzso we find that zzso is a counter zzso for zzso as both soluble and zzso fragments of zzso derived from zzso cell zzso are shown to bind specifically to human zzso with high zzso This interaction is demonstrated zzso to depend on zzso zzso zzso chains of zzso zzso to be preferential for zzso versus zzso and zzso to be regulated by the cellular background in which zzso is zzso Despite lacking a conventional signal zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso representing less than zzso of the full-length zzso retains the ability to integrate into zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and is targeted to the plasma membrane by conventional zzso zzso As demonstrated by a novel zzso that zzso zzso zzso of zzso based on zzso cell sorting zzso we find that zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso present more than ten times as much zzso on their surface compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both the zzso expression level and the zzso binding capacity for zzso are shown to be similar in zzso and zzso cells, suggesting that zzso might be a factor involved in the regulation of zzso export to the cell zzso
