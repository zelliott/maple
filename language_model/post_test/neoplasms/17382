zzso is zzso on tumor cells from many types of human zzso A high level of zzso expression often zzso with poor zzso chemotherapy resistance, and zzso The development of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging will allow in zzso evaluation of zzso expression level for diagnosis or therapeutic zzso 

Two new zzso zzso based on an zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso The affinities of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso peptides to zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells were evaluated in a competitive binding zzso with zzso zzso The cell zzso and retention of zzso and zzso peptides were zzso The tumor zzso and zzso of these two zzso were also evaluated by zzso imaging and zzso zzso 

The labeled peptides retained high binding affinity to zzso and showed much higher zzso in zzso zzso cells than in zzso cells in zzso The smaller and more zzso zzso prosthetic group resulted in higher affinity and lower zzso cell zzso compared to the zzso zzso Both zzso showed much higher zzso in zzso than zzso tumor zzso in mice and allowed clear zzso of zzso expression by zzso Among the two, zzso showed higher tumor zzso and better zzso zzso Unlike their zzso zzso zzso these two zzso had minimal blood zzso likely due to reduced red blood cell zzso zzso zzso such as the liver and zzso also showed high zzso When blocked with zzso cold zzso zzso the tumor zzso was significantly increased, most likely due to the increased concentration in blood zzso as evidenced by decreased liver zzso 

These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso with high tumor zzso low zzso zzso and good zzso contrast promises zzso as a PET zzso for in zzso PET imaging of zzso zzso
