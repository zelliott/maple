We investigated the zzso of zzso zzso in patients zzso from 1992 to 1996 and related our findings to literature zzso 

The zzso of symptomatic zzso zzso in internal patients during zzso was zzso zzso Among these 39 patients, 24 had a zzso whereas 876 out of all zzso patients had a known zzso So, the zzso in this group with cancer was zzso compared with zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso risk for zzso zzso due to zzso was zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso during zzso in a department of general internal medicine is low and does not justify prophylaxis in all internal zzso Cancer is a strong risk factor for zzso zzso in the medical zzso Further studies may answer the question as to whether zzso prophylaxis in this zzso is zzso
