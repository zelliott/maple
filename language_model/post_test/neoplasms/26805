zzso cells need to produce a large amount of energy and, at the same time, need to maintain a constant supply of zzso precursors of zzso that are used as building blocks for generating new zzso Indeed, many cancer cells undergo a switch from zzso to zzso metabolism and display a truncated zzso acid cycle to match these specific zzso requirements of zzso zzso the mechanisms by which cancer cells zzso various zzso pathways to satisfy their unique zzso requirements has become an active field of zzso zzso it has emerged that members of a family of orphan nuclear receptors known as the zzso receptors zzso working in concert with members of the zzso zzso zzso family, act as central zzso regulators of zzso gene networks involved in maintaining energy zzso in normal zzso Recent studies have suggested that the zzso zzso axis is also important in the zzso zzso of cancer zzso This review focuses on the functional integration of the zzso axis with known zzso and the observation that zzso of the activity of this axis can have both zzso and zzso zzso
