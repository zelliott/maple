zzso has become a novel therapeutic alternative for various kinds of zzso Recently, we have zzso the first phase I clinical study in Chile for the treatment of advanced zzso melanoma, using zzso cells zzso loaded with zzso melanoma cell zzso This study included 20 patients and the obtained results, pioneer in Latin America, showed that zzso zzso is innocuous, even provided in combination with zzso In addition, zzso responses were detected in 50% of the treated patients, establishing a positive correlation between the delayed type hypersensitivity zzso reaction, which indicates induction of in zzso zzso memory, and patients zzso Nevertheless, objective clinical responses in vaccinated patients are still zzso Only sporadic objective zzso zzso have been registered and an important proportion of the treated patients did not respond, or their responses were zzso Several strategies have been described to be used by zzso to escape from the immune zzso Actually, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso presentation in melanoma, reducing zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso of the zzso response by zzso cells could be another possible cause of clinical zzso Lately, the existence of zzso of regulatory T zzso zzso able to limit the immune response in a specific form has been established, specially zzso the proliferation and activity of zzso and zzso zzso T zzso These cellular zzso mostly zzso T zzso zzso of zzso origin, or zzso zzso able to release zzso and zzso growth factor beta zzso producing zzso zzso would be accumulated in the body during zzso growth, zzso the immune zzso In relation to RTL and cancer, evidence indicates that zzso cell numbers are increased in blood and other zzso in different types of zzso Additionally, it has been demonstrated that in patients with zzso zzso melanoma, the adoptive zzso of zzso zzso T zzso after zzso chemotherapy was able to induce important zzso zzso that would be due to elimination of RTL zzso Additionally, zzso drugs like zzso besides their effect on zzso zzso also have an zzso effect on T zzso zzso as well as on accumulated zzso In this article, a novel strategy for the study of RTL is proposed, including potential therapeutic zzso which is being pioneered in current clinical zzso
