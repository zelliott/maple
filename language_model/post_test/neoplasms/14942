Multiple sclerosis zzso is an zzso disease triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors which are however individually insufficient to provoke the zzso Previous investigations studied the coexistence of cancer in zzso patients, and only a few relations between the geographic distribution of zzso and that of zzso The aim of this research was to find an environmental link between the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and prevalence of zzso in Croatia were compared with the zzso of the most frequent cancer sites: stomach cancer, cancer of the colon and the zzso pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, cancer of the zzso and brain zzso Data for zzso were collected from seven zzso zzso studies which used zzso diagnostic criteria and reported the number of cases and the magnitude of the studied zzso Data for zzso were drawn from the Croatian National Cancer zzso The analysis was done for single zzso grouped in their belonging regions or counties, and separately for the zzso and the coastal zzso For each rate a zzso confidence zzso was zzso The differences between rates were tested with the zzso test as zzso In addition, zzso zzso or prevalence were correlated with the corresponding cancer zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso were used to measure the correlation between both zzso zzso were done with the statistical package zzso V zzso and the Smith's zzso Package zzso In the zzso area of Croatia the mean annual zzso zzso 100,000 zzso of zzso was nearly two folds higher than in the coastal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The difference was lower when expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso in the zzso area significantly higher zzso rates were found for stomach zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso whilst colon cancer alone zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso or zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso had a significantly higher zzso in the coastal zzso The geographic distribution of zzso expressed by zzso was significantly correlated with pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso This research adds further zzso zzso possibly zzso to the list of diseases with geographic distribution like zzso The similarity of zzso distribution with the named zzso is unlikely to be zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso seems to be associated with a diet rich in meat and zzso A diet rich in fat and meat and poor in vegetables is a risk factor for stomach, zzso pancreatic as well as lung zzso Some authors have documented a possible protective role of the zzso zzso for the named zzso Olive oil is the main source of fat in the zzso zzso zzso zzso compound of the zzso olive oil was found to inhibit the zzso zzso which are involved in zzso and zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso olive oil and particularly zzso to have a protective role in zzso zzso
