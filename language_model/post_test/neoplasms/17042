Cancer pain remains a major challenge and there is an urgent demand for the development of specific zzso zzso Various diseases are associated with unique signatures of expression of zzso zzso which reveal deep insights into disease zzso Using a comprehensive approach combining zzso zzso zzso molecular and in zzso analyses with zzso approaches in a clinically relevant model of zzso zzso pain in mice, we now show that zzso conditions are associated with a marked zzso of 57 zzso in sensory zzso corresponding to zzso zzso By establishing protocols for interference with zzso zzso zzso in peripheral sensory zzso in zzso we functionally validate six zzso zzso as significant zzso of zzso zzso In zzso analyses revealed that their predicted targets include key zzso genes and we identified zzso a gene zzso a zzso channel, as a key zzso target in sensory zzso which is functionally important in zzso zzso hypersensitivity in zzso Our results provide new insights into zzso gene regulatory mechanisms in cancer pain and open up attractive and viable therapeutic zzso
