We conducted a zzso to determine the effects of supervised exercise training on peak oxygen consumption zzso in adults with zzso 

A literature review using zzso zzso zzso the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Scopus zzso and Web of Science zzso was performed to identify zzso controlled trials examining the effects of supervised exercise training on measurement of zzso (via gas exchange zzso in adults with zzso Studies were selected using predetermined criteria, and two independent zzso extracted zzso zzso mean differences zzso were calculated using random effect zzso 

Six studies evaluated zzso involving a total of zzso adult cancer patients zzso zzso zzso zzso usual care control, zzso zzso zzso zzso data indicated that exercise training was associated with a statistically significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso however, significant zzso was evident in this estimate zzso zzso zzso care zzso was associated with a significant decline in zzso from baseline to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated superior improvements in zzso for studies conducted for a shorter duration zzso zzso and following the completion of zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso Exercise training was not associated with a higher zzso of adverse events, although safety was not rigorously monitored or zzso 

zzso exercise training is associated with significant improvements in zzso following a diagnosis of zzso cancer, with minimal adverse zzso
