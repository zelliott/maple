Two dozen cellular zzso have been discovered to date through the study of zzso and the use of gene zzso They form a structurally and functionally zzso zzso At least five distinct mechanisms are responsible for their conversion to active zzso Recent work provides experimental strategies by which many of these zzso as well as zzso of DNA tumor zzso may be placed into functional zzso These procedures may lead to definition of a small number of common pathways through which the various zzso act to transform zzso
