zzso approaches for the detection of common zzso zzso are urgently needed to reduce the worldwide morbidity and mortality caused by zzso zzso zzso are small ( approximately 22 zzso regulatory zzso that are frequently zzso in cancer and have shown promise as zzso markers for cancer zzso and zzso We show here that zzso are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from zzso zzso zzso zzso originating from human prostate cancer zzso enter the zzso are readily measured in zzso and can robustly distinguish zzso mice from zzso This concept extends to cancer in humans, where serum levels of zzso (a zzso expressed in prostate zzso can distinguish patients with prostate cancer from healthy zzso Our results establish the measurement of zzso zzso in serum or plasma as an important approach for the zzso detection of human zzso
