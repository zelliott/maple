The Veterans Health Administration zzso provides high-quality preventive chronic care and cancer care, but few studies have documented improved patient outcomes that result from this high-quality zzso We compared the survival rates of older patients with cancer in the zzso and zzso zzso Medicare and examined whether differences in the stage at diagnosis, zzso of zzso therapies, and zzso characteristics explain survival zzso 

We used zzso methods to compare zzso and zzso survival rates for men older than age 65 years who were diagnosed or received their first course of treatment for zzso zzso lymphoma, or multiple myeloma in zzso hospitals from 2001 to 2004 to similar zzso zzso diagnosed in zzso zzso and End zzso zzso areas in the same time zzso We examined the role of zzso factors by using sensitivity zzso 

zzso patients versus similar zzso zzso patients had higher survival rates of colon cancer zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso lung cancer zzso HR, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and similar survival rates of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The diagnosis of zzso patients at earlier stages explained much of the survival advantages for colon cancer and zzso zzso analyses suggested that additional adjustment for the severity of zzso disease or performance status could have substantial effects on estimated zzso 

The survival rate for older men with cancer in the zzso was better than or equivalent to the survival rate for similar zzso zzso The zzso provision of high-quality care, particularly preventive care, can result in improved patient zzso
