zzso is a DNA strand zzso zzso modification of proteins zzso by zzso zzso zzso with zzso serving as zzso zzso is triggered by DNA strand breaks, is functionally associated with DNA repair pathways and is a survival factor for cells under low to moderate levels of zzso zzso We have previously described a positive correlation between zzso capacity of zzso blood cells with longevity of zzso zzso Our comparison of zzso zzso human and rat zzso revealed that this correlation might be explained in part by evolutionary sequence zzso We have also developed molecular genetic approaches to zzso the zzso status in living zzso Our results revealed that zzso acts as a negative regulator of DNA zzso zzso instability, the latter being known as an important driving force for zzso Our recent data obtained in transgenic mice with selective expression of a dominant negative version of zzso in zzso skin zzso indicate that zzso activity suppresses skin zzso formation in a zzso skin zzso zzso It is tempting to speculate that increased zzso capacity in zzso species might help zzso the zzso of DNA damage and of zzso and thus slow down the rate of aging and of zzso more efficiently as compared with short-lived zzso
