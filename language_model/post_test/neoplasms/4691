This study aimed to determine whether cancer patients report different zzso behaviors zzso investigate why they searched for information, and determine the relationship between their zzso and their socioeconomic and behavioral zzso The authors also explored the relationship between zzso and participation in the medical decision-making process as well as the patients' health zzso 

A sample of zzso French cancer survivors aged 18 or older was interviewed at 2 years following zzso Rather than deciding a zzso who should be considered an information zzso the authors chose to statistically define the different zzso using cluster zzso 

The authors identified 4 distinct zzso zzso zzso seekers and acquainted seekers are generally highly zzso They search for information due to their own motivation or because they are close to the medical zzso zzso information seekers are characterized by a low socioeconomic zzso They perceive themselves as zzso of the health care zzso Finally, the general information seekers did not systematically resort to any specific zzso The authors show that after adjustment, belonging to a specific zzso was associated with the likelihood of participating in the medical decision-making process and, more surprisingly, with health zzso 

A key finding of this study is that social disparities are significantly associated with the different zzso If these relationships are found in other samples, it would further support the need for medical teams to pay more attention to patients with lower levels of education, particularly in health care systems that have acknowledged equality as a founding zzso The clusters determined in this study offer a potential theoretical framework that can be used in future zzso
