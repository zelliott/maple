zzso in DNA zzso which are associated with DNA zzso abnormalities and result in zzso of zzso genes and zzso instability, are involved even in zzso changes in various zzso DNA zzso zzso also account for the zzso zzso and zzso diversity of human zzso zzso we have analyzed DNA zzso on a zzso scale in clinical tissue zzso Our approach using the bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso island amplification method has revealed that DNA zzso zzso correlated with the future development of more zzso zzso are already accumulated at the zzso stage in the zzso liver and urinary zzso DNA zzso profiles at zzso stages are basically inherited by the corresponding zzso developing in individual zzso Such DNA zzso zzso may zzso vulnerability to further genetic and zzso zzso generate more zzso zzso and thus determine patient zzso On the basis of bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso island amplification data, indicators for zzso risk zzso have been established using liver tissue specimens from patients with zzso virus infection, chronic zzso and liver zzso or zzso normal zzso and for zzso using biopsy or surgically zzso specimens from patients with zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Such zzso DNA zzso profiling has now firmly established the clinical relevance of zzso zzso
