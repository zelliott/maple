Monitoring zzso function is crucial in children undergoing zzso To date, a combination of routine serum zzso zzso monitoring with occasional determination of zzso clearance ratio zzso is widely used as clinical standard for this zzso Both methods have their limitations regarding diagnostic value zzso or zzso zzso especially in young zzso zzso alternatives, such as zzso zzso rate zzso zzso formulas have not been proved to be zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate whether serum zzso C zzso may have a diagnostic impact on pediatric zzso 

zzso zzso several zzso zzso formulas zzso zzso Schwartz, zzso zzso and zzso were studied in 80 pediatric cancer patients (age zzso zzso zzso during their zzso Special attention was given to children under the age of 3 in whom accurate urine collection for zzso is zzso 

All parameters correlated similarly well with zzso Total accuracy was zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso In very young children zzso zzso correlation with zzso was for zzso r zzso zzso with an area under the curve zzso of zzso and for zzso r zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Total accuracy was zzso for zzso 50% for zzso 

zzso represents a suitable marker for monitoring zzso function in pediatric cancer zzso In young children zzso zzso zzso may have a better diagnostic value than zzso Future studies should show if zzso can improve zzso monitoring by replacing zzso especially in very young zzso
