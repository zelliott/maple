The aim of this study was to determine whether administration of chemotherapy interferes with the quantitative zzso of zzso zzso zzso V in normal human zzso at zzso h and zzso h after treatment zzso 

Eleven cancer patients were zzso included in this study after written informed zzso Five patients underwent two zzso scans with zzso zzso V within zzso h from each other without any treatment given in between zzso group or group zzso Six other patients starting a new chemotherapy or zzso regimen zzso group or group 2) underwent a zzso scan with zzso zzso V zzso zzso 1 week of treatment zzso and at zzso h and zzso h following treatment zzso zzso and zzso geometric mean counts, corrected for background activity, were obtained from regions of interest drawn on the earliest images and kept constant over all subsequent images per zzso zzso in zzso and organ zzso between successive scans were assessed using zzso zzso 

No significant differences in mean percentages of injected dose zzso in whole body or organ zzso were observed between scan 1 and scan 2 in the control group and between scan 1, 2, and 3 in the treated zzso 

Prior administration of zzso zzso V and administration of chemotherapy does not interfere with quantitative specific zzso in healthy human zzso when using a schedule of baseline and zzso h and zzso h zzso zzso
