Green tea contains zzso antioxidants that have shown zzso properties in animal and in zzso experimental zzso Current data regarding zzso and zzso of tea antioxidants in humans, however, are zzso In this study, plasma and urine zzso power after zzso of green tea was measured using the zzso zzso power zzso zzso zzso patent zzso to assess zzso systemic distribution, and zzso zzso of green tea antioxidants in healthy zzso zzso showed that zzso of green tea antioxidants was zzso with peak increase in plasma zzso of around zzso at 40 minutes after zzso mean increase was 44 zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso of zzso antioxidants was also fast, zzso at zzso minutes, with significant correlation between urinary zzso values and urinary total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In control studies, no increase in plasma or urine zzso values was seen after intake of zzso Although the amount of antioxidants absorbed was relatively small and the increase in plasma zzso power was of short zzso results demonstrate that some potentially zzso zzso antioxidants in green tea enter the systemic circulation soon after zzso and cause a significant increase in plasma zzso zzso This increase may, in turn, lower zzso damage to DNA and so decrease risk of zzso
