zzso is a common symptom in cancer and is usually assessed by multiple questions and zzso zzso A simplified questionnaire would be less burdensome to patients and zzso the zzso 

We compared the reliability at one point in time, sensitivity to change over time, and zzso accuracy of a zzso questionnaire with the zzso Assessment of zzso and zzso zzso shortened zzso version zzso 

zzso with cancer, who were cognitively intact and verbally agreed to participate, completed a zzso questionnaire and zzso in random order and again seven days zzso We compared the direction of response to the zzso zzso questionnaire to the validated zzso score at a single point in time, then zzso changes over a seven-day period of zzso Scores of both questionnaires were divided into poor, moderate and good appetite and compared to survival using zzso zzso zzso was used to construct confidence intervals for estimated probability zzso Survival analysis also used hazard ratios from a Cox zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso individuals from a single institution zzso who were either admitted to an zzso zzso unit or seen in an zzso medicine zzso Median age was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at one point in time was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso over time was zzso zzso zzso - zzso The zzso predicted survival based on scores on Days 1 and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso day 1, zzso zzso day zzso whereas the simplified questionnaire failed to predict zzso 

A simplified questionnaire has moderate correlation with the zzso at one point in time but loses sensitivity over time, and lacks the ability to predict zzso A change in the questionnaire may improve zzso zzso question 2 of the simplified questionnaire to a neutral form zzso same or worse zzso may improve sensitivity and zzso zzso
