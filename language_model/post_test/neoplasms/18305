In order to isolate zzso zzso zzso that bind to zzso zzso zzso we developed the following zzso Using the zzso zzso library we isolated a large number of zzso that bind to the surface of human tumor zzso The zzso were individually screened by zzso and clones that zzso and strongly stained the zzso cells were zzso zzso the zzso recognized by the zzso were zzso For identification of the zzso by zzso candidate molecules had to be zzso either by zzso or by affinity zzso We isolated several hundred zzso that showed zzso zzso zzso In order to identify the zzso that were recognized by the numerous zzso within a short time we developed two zzso Using the zzso zzso of clones by flow zzso zzso method many zzso could be grouped by comparing the zzso patterns of zzso Members in each group turned out to bind to the same zzso in many zzso After a candidate zzso was revealed, the zzso corresponding to its zzso portion was prepared and used for identification of clones that bound to the zzso among all the zzso by SITE zzso identification of clones through three zzso zzso zzso Both methods can be generally zzso to various kinds of membrane proteins and the zzso against zzso
