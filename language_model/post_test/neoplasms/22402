To identify the prevalence of potential zzso interactions between hospital pharmacy dispensed zzso agents and community pharmacy dispensed zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on the zzso department of the internal medicine ward in a large teaching hospital in Amsterdam, the zzso 

Prescription data from the last 100 patients treated with zzso agents were obtained from zzso the chemotherapy prescribing system in the zzso The community pharmacy dispensed drugs of these patients were obtained by using zzso a system that allows regionally linked pharmacies to call up active medication on any zzso Both medication lists were manually screened for potential zzso interactions by using several information sources on zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso table, zzso and Dutch reference zzso 

zzso of potential zzso interactions between zzso agents provided by the hospital pharmacy and drugs dispensed by the community zzso 

zzso patients were included in the zzso A total of 31 potential zzso interactions were found in 16 patients, of which 15 interactions were clinically relevant and would have required an zzso Of these interactions 1 had a level of severity zzso D, meaning the potential zzso interaction could lead to long lasting or permanent damage, or even zzso The majority of the interactions requiring an intervention zzso had a considerable level of evidence zzso 2) and were based on well-documented case reports or controlled interaction zzso Most of the potential zzso interactions involved the zzso drugs zzso zzso pump zzso zzso and antibiotics zzso The zzso drug most involved in the zzso interactions is zzso zzso 

This study reveals a high prevalence of potential zzso interactions between zzso agents provided by the hospital pharmacy and drugs dispensed by the community zzso It shows us there is need for an optimal medication surveillance mechanism to detect potential zzso interactions between these two groups of medication, especially because of the high toxicity of zzso drugs and thus the severe consequences these interactions can have for the zzso
