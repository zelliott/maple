zzso zzso and easily accessible markers of tumor cell death are needed for evaluating early therapeutic efficacy for zzso and chemotherapy so that patients and their physicians can decide whether to remain with a given therapeutic zzso Currently, zzso tests such as zzso zzso scans and magnetic resonance imaging are used to zzso the response of a patient's zzso but often these evaluations are not conducted for weeks to months after treatment zzso While serum levels of zzso proteins such as zzso zzso and prostate specific zzso are commonly monitored to gauge tumor status during therapy and between image evaluations, the levels of these proteins do not always correlate well with the actual tumor zzso In laboratory studies, it has been shown that tumor cells undergoing zzso can release cellular components into cell culture media such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Studies of patient zzso have found that these and other zzso can be found in circulation during cancer therapy, providing a potential source of material for monitoring treatment zzso In the future, analysis of zzso from severe combined zzso mice bearing patient tumor specimens treated with a targeted therapy such as zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso will be useful in the zzso identification of therapy response zzso In this review, the current status of the identification of serum markers of tumor cell zzso is zzso as well as a discussion of critical research questions that must be addressed and the considerations necessary when identifying a marker that reflects true clinical zzso
