Studies by Murphy et zzso have shown that zzso stimulation can activate immediate early genes that code for zzso zzso Recent data suggest that zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and nuclear compartments is responsible for the zzso of synaptic zzso to gene zzso zzso et zzso suggest that zzso influx through zzso zzso zzso channels zzso activates zzso zzso targets such as zzso zzso The zzso complex then zzso to the nucleus leading to zzso and zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso and gene zzso Reports have shown that zzso zzso are found on the zzso zzso Other studies have suggested that zzso of zzso zzso leads to a zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso that triggers gene expression by more direct zzso of nuclear zzso protein zzso zzso Moreover, nuclear zzso factors such as DREAM are themselves zzso further supporting the importance of both nuclear and zzso zzso zzso in regulating gene zzso Our simulation studies suggest that intense synaptic stimulation in combination with amplification by release from zzso zzso stores can produce zzso in nuclear zzso concentration and zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso and gene zzso One of the downstream events would be the production of zzso growth factor zzso zzso has zzso repair, therapeutic or zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso heart and spinal zzso These zzso and zzso zzso can be achieved by either zzso of zzso release from the zzso nerve or zzso of zzso production within the system zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso release from the zzso nerve can inhibit cancer zzso zzso nerve seems to be the nerve that nature intends to regulate organ growth and zzso it is very possible that other than zzso and zzso other growth factors could be found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso nerve would be the most natural and effective way to induce organ zzso and suppress cancer growth, zzso A similar zzso seems to exist for different zzso as zzso has zzso repair, therapeutic or zzso effect on different zzso zzso zzso
