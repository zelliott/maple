Cancer cells are characterized by massive zzso of zzso cell functions with considerable disruption of zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling can be zzso for early detection and molecular zzso of zzso zzso discrimination of functionally different tumor types may help to guide selection of targeted therapy in zzso zzso zzso grouping of tumor types in cancer maps according to their molecular profile may further be helpful for the development of new therapeutic zzso or open new avenues for already established zzso 

Complete available human tumor data of the Stanford zzso Database was downloaded and filtered for zzso zzso and zzso A total of zzso tumor samples from more than zzso experiments and 58 different zzso were zzso Next, a method to score deregulation of zzso zzso maps in different tumor entities was established, which was then used to convert hundreds of gene expression profiles into corresponding zzso zzso activity zzso Based on the latter, we defined a measure for functional similarity between tumor entities, which yielded to zzso of zzso 

We provide a comprehensive, zzso functional cancer map that characterizes tumor types with respect to their biological and functional zzso zzso multiple pathways commonly associated with tumor progression were revealed as common features in the majority of the zzso However, several pathways previously not linked to zzso were identified in multiple zzso suggesting an essential role of these pathways in cancer zzso Among these pathways were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

The functional cancer map provides a systematic view on molecular similarities across different zzso by comparing tumors on the level of zzso zzso This work resulted in identification of novel superimposed functional pathways potentially linked to cancer zzso zzso our work may serve as a starting point for zzso combination of tumor zzso as well as for expanding the application of well-established targeted tumor zzso
