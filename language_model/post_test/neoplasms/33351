As tumors zzso they zzso the vascular network that supplies cells with oxygen and nutrients needed for zzso In response to decreased oxygen levels, the tumor cells initiate a program of adaptation by inducing the zzso of multiple genes via the zzso of the zzso factor zzso factor zzso zzso zzso by a subset of genes induced by zzso promote zzso by acting directly on both the tumor cells and the zzso in which the tumor cells zzso The zzso by which zzso activates zzso is a subject of intensive zzso zzso how zzso activates zzso will provide targets for the development of therapies that could specifically target growing tumors by not allowing adequate adaptation to zzso which is necessary for cancer zzso Here we outline how zzso regulate the activity of zzso during zzso
