zzso zzso cells can demonstrate considerable plasticity to generate other cell types during embryonic development and disease zzso This process occurs through a cell differentiation mechanism known as zzso transition zzso The generation of zzso cells from zzso is a crucial step in zzso cell differentiation to several lineages including zzso zzso mural cells, zzso zzso and zzso Such differentiation patterns have been observed in systems of cardiac development, fibrosis, diabetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we describe the zzso program and discuss the current evidence of zzso acquisition of stem cell characteristics and zzso differentiation zzso
