The aim of this investigation was to study previous zzso of zzso diseases as a risk factor for zzso zzso 

By using the Swedish Cancer zzso all cases of zzso cancer with another zzso disease at least one year previously and living within the zzso area of our hospital were zzso During zzso a total of zzso cases of zzso cancer were zzso Of these 37 had had another previous zzso disease and they constituted the cases in this zzso As controls four persons with at least two zzso diseases, zzso cancer zzso were selected for each case from the same cancer zzso 

Ten zzso of the 37 patients with zzso cancer as a second tumor had earlier been zzso with the treatment dose including the zzso zzso as compared with 34 zzso of the 139 control zzso Eight of the ten cases with previous zzso of the zzso zzso had zzso zzso The median zzso was 13 zzso The estimated radiation dose in the zzso varied between 3 and 40 zzso External zzso gave a crude odds ratio of zzso with zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The weighted odds ratio was calculated to zzso with confidence zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso study gave a non significantly increased odds ratio for zzso cancer in patients with external zzso including the zzso zzso
