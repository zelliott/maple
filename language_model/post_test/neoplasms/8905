The accidental discovery of the zzso properties of zzso in the zzso triggered the development of alternative zzso zzso However, the zzso treatment of tumor diseases is zzso hampered by severe zzso and development of zzso zzso zzso play a significant role in platinum zzso chemotherapy because of their high affinity to the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the entire zzso processing of platinum zzso Strong and irreversible binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso is considered a major step of zzso and reactions with sulfur donors in proteins are believed to affect zzso zzso zzso the development of novel zzso compounds with a pharmacological profile different from that of zzso platinum drugs is a major goal of modern medicinal chemistry and drug zzso Among the zzso zzso agents, zzso complexes have recently gained increasing attention due to their strong tumor cell zzso effects, generally achieved by exploiting zzso mechanisms of zzso The real breakthrough is not simply the use of gold compounds to treat cancer, but the rational design of zzso drugs which may be very effective, zzso and potentially selective towards cancer cells, their potential impact relying on the possible zzso delivery in localized cancer, thus strongly improving cellular zzso and minimizing unwanted zzso Cancer cells are known to zzso specific proteins and receptors needed for tumor zzso Among them, two integral plasma membrane proteins mediate the cellular zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso They are present predominantly in zzso cells of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and kidney but are also localized in other zzso and are zzso in some types of zzso zzso we have been designing zzso zzso derivatives which combine both the zzso properties and reduced zzso of the previously reported zzso zzso with enhanced zzso and tumor selectivity achieved by exploiting zzso zzso Our compounds showed interesting zzso properties towards a number of cancer cell lines in zzso and in zzso on zzso models, together with negligible organ and acute zzso With respect to their mechanisms of action, we identified zzso and zzso as major in zzso and in zzso zzso These results allowed the filing of an international patent for the use of zzso zzso in cancer chemotherapy, as well as providing a solid starting point for them to enter phase I clinical trials in a few zzso
