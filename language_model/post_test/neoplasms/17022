zzso zzso zzso is an attractive target for zzso agents given its central function in DNA zzso growth, zzso and drug resistance of cancer zzso The current clinically established zzso zzso have the shortcomings of short zzso drug resistance, and iron zzso Here, we report the development of a novel class of effective zzso zzso addressing these zzso A novel zzso pocket on the zzso small zzso zzso near the zzso tail was proposed by computer modeling and verified by zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso A compound targeting this pocket was identified by virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute zzso diverse zzso zzso By lead zzso we developed the novel zzso inhibitor zzso that acted as a potent inhibitor of both zzso and cellular human zzso zzso zzso overcame zzso and zzso resistance in cancer zzso It effectively inhibited proliferation of most cell lines in the zzso 60 human cancer panel, most notably zzso cancer and zzso but exerted little effect on normal zzso or zzso zzso In mouse zzso models of human cancer, zzso treatment reduced tumor growth compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso studies confirmed zzso binding to the proposed zzso pocket and offered evidence for assembly blockade of the zzso zzso zzso Our findings offer zzso validation of zzso as a promising new class of zzso zzso with a new mechanism of zzso with broad potential for improved treatment of human zzso
