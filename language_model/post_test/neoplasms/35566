This study aims to identify a novel therapeutic agent for head and neck cancer and to evaluate its zzso zzso 

A zzso and zzso zzso screening of approximately zzso biologically active or clinically used compounds was done using a zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso cells, with secondary screening done on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso normal human zzso zzso The zzso compound was zzso for efficacy in combination with standard zzso on a panel of human cancer cell zzso Furthermore, its mode of action zzso transmission electron zzso and flow zzso and its in zzso efficacy zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso was identified as a novel zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso the dose required to reduce cell viability by 50% was zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In zzso this compound did not interfere with the effects of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and activated zzso after 12 zzso Loss of zzso membrane potential zzso preceded zzso zzso increase and cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso ability of zzso cells, delayed the growth of zzso tumors, and combined zzso with local tumor radiation zzso zzso of zzso zzso on the National Cancer zzso zzso zzso Program 60 human cancer cell lines revealed zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso screening identified a novel zzso compound with significant zzso zzso zzso
