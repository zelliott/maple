zzso cell transformation can be defined as series of progressive genetic events which are happening in one cell clone in limited number of specific zzso These genes could be zzso and/or tumor zzso genes zzso zzso zzso Each change regardless if it is associated with initiation or progression of cancer can be related to a zzso zzso If the aberration is above the limit of the light microscope sensitivity, it should be detected by classical zzso zzso Therefore it was hypothesized that the molecular characteristics of zzso zzso will lead to identification of genes with pivotal role in zzso And indeed, genes important for origin of tumors were identified in zzso zzso zzso Until now, more than zzso zzso were zzso zzso has remarkably developed after the introduction of molecular methods with higher sensitivity zzso zzso We present a short review of molecular zzso methods with a survey of specific zzso zzso and deletions of zzso in several zzso and their zzso value is zzso
