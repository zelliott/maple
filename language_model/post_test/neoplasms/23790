Although many theories for the development of cancer exist, a new hypothesis for zzso is suggested and a new zzso model of zzso transformation zzso Both the hypothesis and the model are based on the principle of a critical point in local energy zzso storage, at a certain level of structural zzso within the zzso This principle has been previously formulated by the author from the rules of zzso zzso The model introduces a new zzso and explores the concepts of both high work value of energy and zzso The ability zzso of cells is suggested to be the most important cellular feature in respect to cell zzso This ability implies that the cells follow the requirement zzso zzso 1, even in dangerous situations and under harmful environmental zzso But, when the cells have lost their ability zzso and all levels of the cell zzso machine have been zzso then the local energy storage may provoke a cascade of harmful events within the zzso The zzso is the most unstable state of the cell zzso If such harmful events take place during DNA synthesis within the zzso cell, in the phase zzso at the 4th zzso they lead ultimately to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso model of zzso is consistent and offers many advantages in comparison to the previous zzso This model could help the design of experiments, development of new drugs and zzso of medical zzso The new hypothesis could contribute to a better understanding of the processes of zzso and the uncontrolled division, growth and zzso of zzso zzso
