zzso zzso of zzso a family of zzso zzso generated by alternative zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in a variety of human tumors and play important roles in tumor progression and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for an zzso zzso by human zzso zzso zzso 6, binds with high affinity to the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as to tumor cell lines in zzso and is suitable for zzso analysis of human zzso zzso of more than 500 tumor samples of different zzso showed that zzso most strongly and zzso zzso with zzso cell zzso zzso zzso analysis of 185 SCC zzso and neck, zzso zzso confirmed zzso of the zzso with zzso of the samples, with intense and homogeneous zzso of the tumor cells in the majority of cases, whereas zzso of zzso with normal zzso is limited to certain zzso and activated zzso When zzso zzso was administered to nude mice bearing human zzso zzso zzso zzso fast and selective tumor zzso of the zzso with a maximum of zzso of the injected dose per gram of tissue was zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso is a promising targeting vehicle for zzso of zzso cell zzso in zzso
