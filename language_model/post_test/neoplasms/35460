To evaluate the impact of the aging of our population in the growing of diabetes zzso among patients treated inward at our zzso 

The clinical files of 242 diabetics older than zzso years, treated between 1999 and 2002 were studied zzso zzso zzso age, year of first zzso clinical zzso of admission, zzso duration of diabetes, previous zzso treatment, duration of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data were zzso 

A progressive rising in the number of aged patients was found during this period zzso in 1999 to 55 in zzso with a large proportion of women zzso The more frequent causes of zzso treatment were zzso zzso and feet zzso zzso or zzso zzso In nearly zzso of the cohort an acute infection was zzso Diabetes was unknown in zzso of cases and less than ten years of duration in zzso In this cohort most of the patients zzso were treated with oral zzso drugs, mostly zzso zzso mean value was zzso zzso zzso C zzso was measured in a subset of cases zzso suggesting deficient insulin zzso in zzso of zzso The global mean duration of zzso was zzso zzso zzso patients zzso died during the zzso 

In this study, we concluded that diabetes in people older than 75 years, is being progressively more often zzso The general zzso control was bad zzso mean zzso zzso zzso with a significant number of patients presenting a deficient zzso zzso worsened by frequent zzso zzso So, a strengthened clinical care, directed to a careful diagnosis and treatment, may effectively contribute to a better prognosis and quality of life of aged diabetic zzso
