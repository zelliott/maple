Awareness that cancer impacts not only the person with the disease but also the family has increased, yet existing data provide limited information, primarily because of reliance on small geographically restricted zzso The current study used zzso sampling to develop a formula to zzso the probability of survivors completing a zzso survey and nominating their family zzso 

Eleven zzso state cancer zzso participated in the American Cancer Society Study of Cancer zzso survey, providing information about the survivors, including their age, zzso zzso type of cancer, and stage of zzso A total of zzso cancer survivors met the inclusion criteria zzso years old and diagnosed with one of the 10 common zzso 

zzso zzso of survivors identified from state cancer zzso completed the zzso survey, of whom zzso nominated a zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that middle-aged, female, or zzso survivors and survivors diagnosed with breast or zzso cancer were more likely to complete the survey and nominate a zzso whereas survivors with zzso or lung cancer and survivors with zzso cancer were less likely to complete the survey and nominate a zzso 

Using the formula based on the zzso zzso analysis results, a number of certain groups of survivors to be recruited from state registry can be calculated in order to have a present number of zzso to contact for participation into a caregiver zzso This is practical and valuable information, which fosters research that uses state cancer zzso and increases the zzso of findings to multiple types of cancer and different stages of zzso
