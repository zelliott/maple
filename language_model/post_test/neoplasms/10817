zzso is an active component zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and has shown zzso zzso However, its mechanism of action remains zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on a panel of cancer cell lines and analyzed its mechanism in zzso cells, a zzso colon zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso markedly inhibited the growth of all examined cancer cell zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The event of zzso was accompanied by the release of zzso zzso zzso of zzso membrane potential, and zzso and zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso zzso and induced the zzso of zzso 9, zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso mediates the growth zzso of cancer cells through multiple targets, which include the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso suggesting zzso is a potent cancer preventive and therapeutic zzso
