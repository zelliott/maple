zzso is a zzso reducing zzso that is an important detoxifying zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso zzso and the gene is induced by a wide variety of zzso We showed that zzso can selectively increase zzso activity in human and zzso tumors, and that this enhanced the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso However, we found that zzso activity was not increased in some human tumor cell lines after treatment with the zzso and this appeared to be due to a lack of increased zzso To determine if this lack of increased zzso was due to a zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene in these cells, we zzso approximately 2000 bases of the zzso promoter region from zzso cells and compared these with sequences from human zzso colon cancer cells, which showed significant increases in zzso transcription, and the sequence reported for human liver cells in zzso zzso analysis showed no changes in the sequences of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso box, zzso zzso site or zzso site, in the tumor cells compared with the zzso zzso The only major change was a deletion of a 20 base repeat region approximately 400 bases zzso to the zzso element in all the cells, including the zzso cells, compared with the sequence reported in zzso There were also several insertions of a single base in various parts of the sequences which occurred in most, or all, of the cell lines compared with the reported zzso and a small number of single base changes, insertions or deletions that occurred in a single cell zzso However, these changes did not appear to correlate with differences in induced zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the differences in zzso of the zzso gene after treatment with zzso zzso was not due to zzso in the promoter region of the zzso
