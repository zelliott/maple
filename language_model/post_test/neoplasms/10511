Our objective was to evaluate the association of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in large arteries as detected by zzso zzso with the subsequent occurrence of vascular events in otherwise zzso cancer zzso 

Clinical follow-up information was obtained for zzso cancer patients examined with zzso zzso zzso zzso follow-up time, 29 zzso Among this zzso 279 patients had died from their zzso zzso In 15 of zzso patients zzso a vascular event, defined as zzso stroke, zzso zzso or zzso was zzso The zzso standardized zzso value zzso was divided by the zzso zzso yielding a zzso ratio zzso for each zzso zzso The mean TBR as well as a zzso plaque sum score per patient were calculated in the major zzso zzso zzso and abdominal zzso zzso arch, as well as zzso and carotid zzso 

A significant correlation was observed between mean TBR and zzso plaque sum zzso zzso zzso Although zzso plaque sum significantly correlated with all conventional risk factors for vascular events, mean TBR correlated only with age, the male sex, and zzso The Cox zzso hazard model identified a mean TBR zzso zzso and a zzso plaque sum zzso 15 as independent zzso for the occurrence of a vascular zzso Patients with both mean TBR and zzso plaque sum above these thresholds were identified as having the highest risk for a future vascular zzso However, a mean TBR zzso zzso had greater zzso value than did a zzso plaque sum zzso zzso 

In a large cohort of cancer patients, increased zzso zzso in major arteries emerged as the strongest predictor of a subsequent vascular zzso zzso severe vascular zzso seemed to impart a particularly high zzso Given the small event rate in the present study, larger, prospective trials of patients without cancer are required to substantiate these promising zzso
