The zzso environment of advanced tumors is a primary obstacle to the efficacy of zzso and vaccine zzso Here, we report an approach to arm an zzso virus with zzso zzso zzso to stimulate beneficial zzso responses in zzso A zzso zzso zzso controlled by the zzso promoter and expressing zzso zzso was constructed and nine patients with progressing advanced solid tumors zzso to standard therapies were treated zzso No serious adverse events resulting in patient hospitalization zzso zzso or no increases in zzso zzso were seen, suggesting effective zzso zzso zzso An assessment of the blood levels of virus indicated zzso of the samples zzso zzso 40) were positive at a low level early after treatment, but not zzso In contrast, high levels of virus, zzso and zzso were documented locally at the zzso zzso blood zzso cells were analyzed by zzso zzso analysis and induction of both zzso and zzso T cells was zzso zzso zzso responses were even more pronounced when assessed by zzso zzso zzso after stimulation with tumor zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso patients, zzso displayed disease control at 3 months and in both cases in which treatment was continued the effect was sustained for at least 8 zzso zzso and zzso zzso responded zzso Together, these findings support further clinical evaluation of zzso
