Phase I clinical trials of the combination of oral zzso with zzso zzso were conducted in patients with solid tumors over either a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso (160 zzso zzso The zzso dose, which was four times the zzso dose zzso zzso was previously shown to be optimal at zzso the degradation of zzso zzso zzso was performed on the first dose of the first day of zzso zzso was measured by zzso whereas zzso and zzso were measured using zzso Plasma levels were highest for zzso followed by zzso and zzso at all time zzso Peak and trough levels after selected subsequent doses were also zzso these varied in the individual from day to zzso zzso plasma levels zzso for zzso zzso and zzso except in one patient were achieved at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Generally, lower doses yielded more rapid zzso of zzso and zzso levels than did higher zzso No correlation was observed between zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, after the highest zzso and zzso dose zzso 300 zzso study zzso the zzso and zzso values of zzso revealed significant differences zzso zzso zzso in three patients each with and without zzso These associations were similarly observed with zzso Our findings thus indicate that measuring plasma zzso and more importantly, the zzso levels, may predict zzso toxicity and enable subsequent dose zzso
