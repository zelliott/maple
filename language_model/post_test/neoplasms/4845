Recent research on respiratory chain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown that the zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso which is composed of complex I zzso zzso zzso and complex II zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso energy metabolism of adult zzso inhabiting zzso The zzso in these zzso pathways are potential target for zzso We isolated a novel compound, zzso from zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso at zzso zzso It competes for the zzso site in complex I and shows high selective toxicity to the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso exerts zzso activity against zzso zzso in in zzso trials with sheep indicating that zzso complex I is a promising target for zzso In addition to complex I, complex II is a good target because its zzso direction is reverse of zzso zzso in the host complex zzso Furthermore, we found zzso and zzso strongly and specifically inhibit zzso complex zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso was found not only in the zzso but also in some types of human cancer zzso Analysis of the zzso from the cancer cells identified an zzso as a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso Role of zzso of human complex II in the hypoxic condition of cancer cells and fetal zzso is a zzso This article is part of a Special zzso entitled zzso of zzso Life and zzso zzso
