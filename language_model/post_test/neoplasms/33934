Given that there are millions of zzso zzso zzso in the entire human zzso a major difficulty faced by scientists in planning costly zzso zzso is to choose target zzso that are most likely to affect zzso functions and ultimately contribute to disease zzso Although it is widely accepted that sequences with important functionality tend to be less variable across species because of selective pressure, to what extent evolutionary conservation is mirrored by zzso outcome has never been zzso In this study, we surveyed odds ratios detected for 46 zzso in 39 different zzso genes from 166 molecular zzso zzso The conservation levels of zzso acid that these zzso affected were calculated as a tolerance index by comparing sequences from different zzso Our results provide evidence of a significant relationship between the detected odds ratios associated with cancer risk and the conservation levels of the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were further calculated for zzso zzso zzso identified in 90 human DNA repair zzso of which 103 caused zzso acid changes in very zzso zzso Our findings support the concept that zzso altering the zzso zzso acids are more likely to be associated with cancer zzso Using such a molecular evolutionary approach may hold great promise for zzso zzso to be zzso in future molecular zzso zzso
