Distant organ zzso is the most important factor in determining patient survival in zzso This is thought to occur via the body's own systems for transporting fluid and cells, the blood vascular and zzso zzso Cancer cells may exploit these vascular systems by expressing growth factors, which alter the normal pattern of zzso and zzso vessel growth zzso thus creating zzso for zzso zzso With respect to zzso zzso techniques which allow the mapping of a zzso zzso drainage and sampling of the zzso zzso from the regional zzso zzso group provide crucial zzso information, determine further treatment and offer a window into zzso immune zzso zzso drainage patterns so identified are both clinically zzso and highlight important anatomical and molecular complexities not explained by existing models of zzso development or zzso The molecular controls of zzso zzso and factors determining which zzso vessel zzso are induced may be targets for novel zzso designed to restrict cancer zzso Furthermore, analyses of these control mechanisms will enhance our understanding of the interactions between the zzso cells and the zzso zzso For many years, disparate groups of clinical researchers and basic scientists have been working to unravel the mysteries of the zzso zzso This review aims to zzso these contributions, in terms of the history, zzso structure and function of zzso vessels in cancer and the role they play in zzso zzso Current ideas about the roles of zzso growth factors, their zzso pathways in zzso zzso and therapeutic opportunities to restrict this spread will also be zzso
