Medical imaging has made significant contributions to the characterization of zzso zzso In many cases, however, maps from multiple zzso may be required for more complete tumor zzso In this manuscript we propose an objective method for combining multiple imaging zzso with the goal of characterizing zzso zzso We refer to the proposed technique as the percent overlap method zzso To demonstrate the power and flexibility of the zzso analysis, we present four patients with zzso zzso zzso Each patient had multiple magnetic resonance imaging procedures resulting in seven different zzso zzso Chemical shift imaging was used to provide three zzso ratio maps zzso zzso zzso A zzso scan provided regional cerebral blood volume and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mapping data were also zzso Composite maps were formed for each patient using zzso then were compared to results from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso maps of likely zzso tumor regions were found to be consistent with the zzso zzso zzso This manuscript presents an objective method for combining parameters from multiple zzso imaging techniques into a single composite zzso The accuracy of the map depends strongly on the sensitivity of the chosen imaging parameters to the disease process at the time of image zzso Further validation of this method may be achieved by correlation with zzso zzso
