The most desirable way of eliminating the cancer zzso is by zzso While the removal of zzso agents is the primary goal of cancer zzso for the foreseeable future it is likely to be zzso Therefore the development of a second line of cancer prevention based on zzso assumes zzso During the past decade a growing number of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals have been found which prevent or reduce the occurrence of cancer especially in experimental zzso These compounds belong to more than 20 different classes of zzso The mechanisms of action of most of them are up to now poorly zzso zzso zzso of zzso according to the time during the zzso process at which they are effective it is possible to divide them into 3 main zzso Substances that prevent the formation of zzso from zzso blocking agents and suppressing zzso There are also several classes of chemicals that inhibit the phase of tumor zzso But many zzso only act in combination with specific zzso or in distinct species, specific zzso zzso or situations, and completely different effects under other circumstances cannot be ruled zzso In terms of application of the existing data to prevention of human cancer there has been a focus on 2 types of zzso To select compounds that have little toxicity zzso zzso acid, zzso but which have not been shown to have broad zzso zzso or to select compounds zzso zzso which have zzso efficacy but also can produce toxic side zzso When one evaluate a zzso compound, considerations of its projected use are highly zzso If the compound seems to be very potent but has significant zzso it may be useful for high-risk individuals but not for the general zzso
