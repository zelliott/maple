zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have separately shown significant zzso activity in a wide range of solid zzso A phase I study was conducted in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso and zzso zzso zzso of their combination in patients with zzso solid zzso 

Fifteen patients with zzso confirmed zzso solid zzso were zzso The patients' median age was 65 years, 10 were male, and 12 had a performance status score zzso of zzso zzso was administered on day 1 as a zzso intravenous infusion at escalated doses ranging from 35 to 40 zzso zzso was administered on days zzso per zzso at escalated doses ranging from zzso to 1,800 zzso given as two daily divided zzso Treatment was repeated every 3 zzso 

At the dose of zzso 40 zzso and zzso 1,800 zzso all 3 enrolled patients presented zzso zzso patients grade 3 zzso zzso zzso and 1 patient grade 3 zzso and thus, the recommended zzso for future phase II studies is zzso 40 zzso and zzso 1,700 zzso A total of 57 treatment cycles were zzso Grade 2/3 zzso complicated 9 zzso cycles and 1 patient was hospitalized for zzso zzso There was no septic zzso The main zzso toxicity was zzso grade 2 in 3 zzso patients and grade 3 in 4 zzso zzso was the reason of treatment interruption for 3 zzso Other zzso were mild and easily zzso Two patients zzso with partial response suffering from gastric cancer and 5 patients with zzso stable disease were observed among 12 zzso zzso 

The results of this phase I study demonstrate that zzso and zzso can be combined at clinically effective and relevant zzso However, zzso is a common side effect and further investigation is warranted to define its precise role in the treatment of solid zzso
