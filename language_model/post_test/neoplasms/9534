This review provides an overview of a selection of the most pertinent molecular pathways that link cancer and aging and focuses on those where recent advances were most zzso When organizing the bulk of information on this subject, I became aware of the fact that the most evident zzso zzso mechanisms that influence aging and mechanisms that influence cancer zzso is difficult to zzso Most mechanisms explaining the aging process are also those that influence zzso zzso that are described in tumor zzso pathways are also contributors to the aging zzso From an intuitive point of view, there are phenomena that have traditionally been contributed to aging others to zzso factors and they are presented zzso
