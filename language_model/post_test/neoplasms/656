Regulatory T cells zzso have been shown to suppress zzso immunity and often are increased in humans and zzso with zzso However, zzso have not been well studied in dogs with cancer and it is not known if certain tumor types are associated with increased zzso 

We hypothesized that zzso percentages would be increased in dogs with cancer and that zzso percentages would be higher in dogs with certain types of zzso 

The percentages and numbers of zzso and zzso T cells and B cells were assessed in 34 dogs with cancer and 9 zzso control zzso Dogs evaluated included 14 dogs with zzso 7 dogs with zzso 7 dogs with lymphoma, and 6 dogs with mast cell zzso 

Numbers and percentages of zzso zzso and zzso T cells and B cells were determined using flow zzso and compared between control dogs and dogs with zzso 

The percentage of zzso was significantly increased overall in dogs with cancer compared with control zzso When tumor types were zzso zzso percentages were significantly increased in dogs with zzso The zzso T cell ratio was significantly higher in dogs with cancer compared with control dogs and was also significantly increased in 2 dogs with zzso zzso 

zzso percentages in blood were increased in dogs with cancer, particularly in dogs with zzso The zzso ratio also identified zzso abnormalities in dogs with zzso These findings indicate that zzso factors may affect zzso in zzso
