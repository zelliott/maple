Clinical trials of zzso therapy in patients with advanced cancer may not pay sufficient attention to quality of life zzso and supportive care issues, resulting in an adverse impact on the quality of care zzso We hypothesized that the simultaneous delivery of zzso therapy and a structured program of supportive care would result in measurable improvements in zzso outcomes without adverse events for patients, zzso or the zzso zzso This report describes the findings of a trial designed to test the feasibility and initial results of such an zzso zzso patients accrued to Phase I or Phase II zzso therapy trials were simultaneously enrolled into a defined home care program focused on supportive care needs of the patient and family, as well as assessment of the zzso of zzso zzso These 44 patients constitute the zzso Care zzso zzso Twenty patients receiving zzso therapy and the standard supportive care measures available through the Cancer Center served as a control group, designated the zzso Care zzso zzso We measured zzso using baseline and monthly assessments of the zzso Assessment of Cancer zzso zzso zzso This instrument measures four zzso of zzso physical, zzso functional, and zzso We zzso defined zzso zzso the percentage of hospice zzso hospice length of zzso and number of cycles of chemotherapy zzso A summary score for the four zzso zzso at each time point for each patient was calculated zzso zzso The zzso 4 scores of the SC group improved compared to the UC group but did not reach a significant zzso Individual scores reflected a wide range of zzso zzso A statistically significant difference in referral to hospice was seen in the SC group zzso compared to the UC group zzso zzso The median length of stay in hospice was the same for both zzso but the mean stay was greater in the SC cohort (54 zzso compared to the UC cohort zzso zzso The mean number of chemotherapy cycles was not different between SC and UC zzso The zzso acceptance by patients, zzso physicians and Cancer Center support staff was zzso zzso Patients with advanced cancer at the time of enrollment onto zzso therapy should have made an explicit transition to zzso care goals but often have zzso In the current health care environment, patients with advanced cancer without zzso potential may be forced by their health provider or health insurer to choose between zzso therapy (including zzso zzso or structured best supportive care zzso In this emerging era of targeted therapies, SC provides an approach designed to zzso zzso care goals while supporting the clinical research mission of offering patients with advanced cancer new and potentially better therapeutic zzso SC is a system of care that enhances patient choice by allowing patients and families to have concurrent access to two beneficial zzso SC may enhance coordination of care and facilitate patients' explicit transition from zzso intent to zzso zzso In order to validate this approach, a zzso comparative trial evaluating SC has been zzso
