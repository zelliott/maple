The Cut zzso gene 1 zzso codes for several zzso proteins that display distinct DNA binding and zzso zzso Some zzso zzso were previously shown to stimulate entry into S zzso More recently, zzso zzso of zzso was shown to cause a decrease in cell migration and zzso In contrast, zzso expression of zzso or zzso zzso zzso cell migration and invasion in tissue zzso Moreover, zzso to the lung was observed in a few cases following development of zzso tumors in zzso zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso on promoter zzso zzso led to the identification of more than 20 genes that are directly regulated by zzso and code for proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso transition and zzso zzso Many targets of zzso are regulators of zzso zzso that play a role both in cell cycle progression and cell zzso Interestingly, some genes that promote cell zzso are activated by zzso while some genes that inhibit cell zzso are zzso by zzso The dual function of zzso as an zzso and zzso is best exemplified by the regulatory cascade zzso zzso activates expression of the Snail and zzso zzso factors and then zzso with them to repress the zzso and zzso zzso thereby causing a severe disorganization of zzso zzso Together, these studies indicate that zzso stimulates cell zzso by regulating a large number of genes involved in various molecular zzso
