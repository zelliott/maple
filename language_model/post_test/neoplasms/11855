A zzso model of zzso is proposed based on recent evidence for the occurrence of zzso in the zzso zzso evidence for gene amplification during zzso and studies of the action of tumor zzso The model is zzso on the view that an increase in the level of gene product from such zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso It proposes that the initial step in zzso zzso is a zzso producing a tandem zzso of a zzso Gene amplification can then occur by successive unequal sister zzso zzso events in several cell cycles until sufficient gene product is produced to transform the zzso
