zzso zzso zzso constitute the most rapidly growing class of human zzso and the second largest class of drugs after zzso The treatment of zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer has benefited considerably from the use of therapeutic zzso either alone or in combination with standard zzso zzso zzso however, demonstrate that the zzso of these zzso is still zzso The concept of improving the zzso activity of zzso is well established and zzso the zzso induced by zzso zzso can be achieved by strategies that target the downstream zzso zzso zzso The recruitment of zzso zzso functions appears well suited in this regard, because several lines of evidence suggest that enhancing zzso cellular zzso zzso induced by therapeutic zzso may directly improve their clinical zzso The zzso zzso cells involved in zzso are zzso natural killer zzso cells, but also zzso T cells can be amplified and zzso for stronger zzso zzso zzso T cells are raising a considerable interest in the zzso community given their intrinsic zzso activity that can be zzso by stimulation with synthetic zzso zzso or with drugs that cause their zzso into target cells, like zzso zzso and low doses zzso zzso The field is interesting, and several papers have already explored this approach in solid and zzso zzso Thus, we propose that enhancing the efficacy of zzso by combination with zzso T cell zzso may have considerable therapeutic potential for a variety of zzso most especially for patients whose zzso zzso impair zzso
