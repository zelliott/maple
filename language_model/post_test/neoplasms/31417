zzso zzso is a powerful tool in the local control of zzso The advantages of zzso zzso over zzso therapy arise from the phenomenon known as the Bragg zzso This phenomenon enables large doses to be delivered to zzso volumes while sparing surrounding healthy zzso To fully realize the potential of this technique the location of the high-dose volume must be controlled very zzso An imaging system was designed and tested to monitor the zzso activity created by the beam as a means of zzso the zzso range, monitoring dose, and determining tissue zzso The zzso imaging system consists of 12 pairs of zzso zzso detectors zzso in zzso Each crystal was zzso zzso in diameter, zzso zzso long, and separated by zzso zzso from other detectors in the zzso These are arranged in two zzso 60 zzso apart, with the zzso beam and tissue zzso zzso between and parallel to the detector zzso zzso were conducted with 150 zzso continuous and zzso zzso beams which had beam currents ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The production and zzso of short-lived zzso zzso and zzso was studied using 1 zzso zzso with a continuous zzso These zzso provide a significant signal on short time zzso making zzso imaging zzso zzso beams, having a period of 10 zzso were used to study zzso imaging and the production and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data were acquired and zzso images were obtained between beam zzso and indicate that range zzso is possible, for a 150 zzso zzso after one beam pulse, to within the zzso zzso resolution limit of the imaging zzso The dose delivered to the patient may also be monitored by observing the increase in the number of coincidence events detected between successive beam zzso Over zzso of the initial zzso activity is from zzso while the remainder is primarily zzso zzso zzso with traces of zzso and zzso zzso imaging may also be performed along the beam path by fitting zzso data collected after the treatment is zzso Using this technique, it is shown that variations in zzso composition in zzso treatment volumes may be identified and used to locate zzso zzso zzso imaging also reveals that zzso is created well beyond the Bragg peak, apparently by secondary zzso
