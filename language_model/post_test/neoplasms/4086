We have isolated signal zzso zzso of low molecular weight from zzso and zzso Since zzso of differentiation and zzso may be developed as new zzso agents, we have studied induction of differentiation and zzso in zzso cells by our signal zzso zzso zzso isolated as an zzso function inhibitor induced zzso differentiation in human zzso zzso zzso zzso may induce differentiation by zzso of zzso reactions in the zzso We isolated zzso from zzso as a zzso zzso zzso and zzso its stable zzso zzso The stable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation in rat zzso zzso cells, possibly by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso DNA fragmentation in mouse leukemia zzso and human zzso zzso zzso was shown to induce zzso by hydrogen zzso zzso Thus, these signal zzso zzso appear to be useful tools for the zzso study of cellular differentiation and zzso
