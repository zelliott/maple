zzso DNA zzso I is a zzso zzso which is essential for zzso zzso In addition to its classical DNA zzso activities which are needed for relaxation of zzso DNA, zzso I can zzso certain zzso zzso The zzso is also involved in zzso regulation through its ability to associate with other proteins in the zzso and possibly zzso zzso complexes, and is implicated in the recognition of DNA zzso Finally, zzso I is a zzso which can mediate illegitimate zzso A crucial reaction intermediate during relaxation of DNA is the formation of a zzso I complex (the zzso zzso where zzso I is zzso linked to a 3 zzso of DNA thereby creating a single stranded DNA zzso zzso complexes are also formed in the vicinity of DNA zzso and in the presence of the zzso agent, zzso While formation of zzso complexes may be necessary for the initial stages of the DNA damage response, these complexes are also potentially dangerous to the cell due to their ability to mediate illegitimate zzso which can lead to zzso instability and zzso Thus the levels and stability of these complexes have to be strictly zzso This is obtained by maintaining the zzso levels relatively constant, by limiting the stability of the zzso complexes through physical interaction with the zzso zzso protein zzso and by degradation of the zzso I by the zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggest that these regulatory functions are zzso in tumor cells, explaining at the same time why zzso I activities so often are increased in certain human tumors, and why these cells are zzso to the zzso effects of zzso
