The advent of sophisticated experimental tools that can probe the molecular pathology of cancer has revealed a number of genes and gene families that could prove attractive targets for cancer zzso Thus, gene zzso strategies have been envisioned to treat cancer by targeting the cancer cell's capacity to: zzso resist conventional treatment methods zzso and zzso zzso promote zzso and zzso zzso and/or to survive zzso that normally would promote cell zzso The realization of such strategies is limited by the lack of zzso technologies that enable the safe and effective delivery of zzso agents to zzso cells following systemic zzso There are many reasons for this, including an incomplete understanding of how cancer cells respond when genes are zzso Further the zzso and zzso attributes of gene therapy products are not well zzso This review will discuss gene therapy strategies that have been developed based on gene zzso by the use of zzso zzso zzso and zzso interference zzso In this context, several particularly promising targets will be zzso with a focus on strategies that have progressed to the stage where clinical trials have been zzso The review highlights product development strategies that emphasize zzso systemic zzso and the potential for delivery systems to become an enabling technology for development of effective gene therapy zzso
