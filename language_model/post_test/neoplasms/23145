zzso delivery of a zzso treatment can be influenced by a number of zzso It has been demonstrated that the electronic portal imaging device zzso is valuable for transit portal zzso zzso Patient related dose differences can emerge at any time during treatment and can be zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sporadically during zzso The aim of this study is to investigate how systematic and random information appears in zzso transit dose zzso measured in the zzso plane over the entire course of a treatment and how this information can be used to examine zzso trends, building toward a methodology to support zzso zzso To create a trend overview of the zzso changes in transit dose, the predicted portal dose for the different beams is compared to a measured portal dose using a zzso zzso For each beam of the delivered zzso information is extracted from the zzso images to differentiate systematic from random dose delivery zzso From the systematic differences of a fraction for a projected anatomical structures, several metrics are extracted like percentage zzso with zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate for four example cases the trends and dose difference causes which can be detected with this zzso Two sample prostate cases show the occurrence of a random and systematic difference and identify the organ that causes the zzso In a lung cancer case a trend is shown of a rapidly diminishing zzso zzso zzso during the course of treatment, which was detected with this trend analysis zzso The final example is a breast cancer case where we show the influence of zzso differences on the zzso transit zzso A method is presented based on zzso portal transit zzso to record dose changes throughout the course of treatment, and to allow trend analysis of dose zzso We show in example cases that this method can identify the causes of dose delivery differences and that treatment adaptation can be triggered as a zzso It provides an important element toward informed decision-making for zzso zzso
