To determine the short-term and zzso risks of cancer in patients receiving zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso therapies that have proven effective in the treatment of chronic inflammatory zzso 

By linking together data from the Swedish zzso zzso Swedish registers of zzso and the Swedish Cancer zzso we identified and analyzed for cancer occurrence a national cohort of zzso patients with zzso who first started zzso therapy between January 1999 and July zzso As zzso we used a national zzso zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso a cohort of zzso patients newly starting zzso zzso zzso zzso a cohort of zzso patients newly starting zzso zzso drug combination therapy zzso zzso zzso and the general population of zzso Relative risks zzso were estimated using Cox zzso zzso examining overall zzso as well as zzso by time since the first start of zzso therapy, by the duration of active zzso therapy, and by the zzso agent zzso 

During zzso zzso of followup in zzso patients newly starting zzso 240 first zzso occurred, yielding an zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso versus the zzso zzso zzso and similar zzso versus the other 2 zzso zzso zzso did not increase with increasing time since the start of zzso therapy, nor with the cumulative duration of active zzso zzso During the first year following the first treatment start, but not thereafter, dissimilar cancer risks for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

During the first 6 years after the start of zzso therapy in routine care, no overall zzso of cancer risk and no increase with followup time were zzso
