In clinical zzso most patients tolerate the applied dosage with no or moderate side zzso However, 5 to zzso of all individuals show increased acute and/or late zzso zzso test systems are investigated for their suitability for zzso zzso This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet zzso and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet zzso for prediction of radiation zzso 

zzso zzso of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the zzso disease zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after zzso in the comet zzso zzso cell gel zzso These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the zzso grading zzso 

The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA zzso zzso of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue zzso zzso of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA zzso In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair zzso 

The comet zzso seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso tests, the comet zzso needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical zzso
