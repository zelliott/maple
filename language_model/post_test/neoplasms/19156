A zzso gel zzso system for the zzso of zzso receptors in target organ tissue samples as small as 50 zzso is presented and compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Only specific zzso binding of zzso to zzso zzso has been observed with the zzso gel zzso zzso despite the presence of relatively high levels of zzso binding zzso The system could be adapted to the clinical determination of zzso zzso content in biopsy material from zzso and zzso zzso and would be of value in predicting hormone zzso
