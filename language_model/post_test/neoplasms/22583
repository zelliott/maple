zzso activity of molecules and cells of the innate immune system has been zzso Here we propose a method for targeting preferred innate immune cells and magnifying their zzso effect at the tumor zzso by modular zzso complexes zzso zzso As a model, zzso complexes were assembled carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso The complexes showed high binding capacity to zzso cancer cells in zzso high induction of zzso zzso zzso by the activated zzso and ability to mediate zzso attachment to zzso zzso zzso treatment was found safe in in zzso testing and induced change in zzso zzso zzso in tumors zzso We thus present a new vision of targeting a desired innate immune response to the tumor zzso
