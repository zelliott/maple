zzso inflammation can induce various molecules expressed from the tumors themselves or surrounding cells to create a zzso that potentially promotes cancer zzso zzso particularly chronic zzso is often linked to cancer development, even though its evolutionary role should impair zzso objects including zzso The inflammation amplifier, a zzso of zzso in zzso cells, is the principal machinery for inflammation and is activated by the simultaneous stimulation of zzso and zzso We have zzso inflammation as local zzso of the inflammation amplifier, which causes an zzso of various immune cells followed by zzso of local zzso Genes related to the inflammation amplifier have been genetically associated with various human inflammatory zzso Here, we describe how zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are strongly enriched in genes related to the zzso The inflammation amplifier is activated by the stimulation of zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso resulting in the subsequent expression of various target genes for zzso and zzso genes like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, we conclude that inflammation does indeed associate with the development of zzso The identified genes associated with the inflammation amplifier may thus make potential therapeutic targets of zzso
