Natural killer cell activity, which represents the spontaneous zzso of zzso toward tumor cells, has been measured in 173 zzso patients and 25 healthy zzso no significant difference was found in mean natural killer cell activity between the two zzso The parameters of zzso zzso of natural killer cells were studied in order to provide a suitable test for monitoring the effect of zzso in clinical zzso The three zzso tested zzso zzso and zzso were equally active in inducing spontaneous zzso of zzso from all healthy individuals and zzso patients zzso zzso for one zzso with 100 units of zzso was sufficient to increase spontaneous zzso activity, the maximum effect being obtained when zzso were incubated with 1000 units of any of the zzso zzso This effect was blocked with the appropriate zzso zzso The target cells for zzso seem to be positive zzso gamma zzso zzso
