zzso is a potentially serious side effect of chemotherapy and a major risk factor for infections, which can be zzso It has been zzso that a low bacterial diet zzso can prevent the occurrence of infections and zzso mortality in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of zzso but much remains zzso 

The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of an zzso versus a control diet in preventing the occurrence of infection and to decrease zzso mortality in adult and zzso cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of zzso Secondary objectives were to assess the time to first zzso episode, the need for empirical zzso therapy, diet zzso and quality of zzso 

We searched the following electronic zzso the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso (The Cochrane Library, issue 3 zzso Database of zzso of zzso of zzso zzso (The Cochrane Library, issue 3 zzso zzso (from 1946 to 20 October zzso zzso (from 1980 to 20 October zzso and zzso (from 1981 to 20 October zzso In addition, we searched several conference proceedings (from 2000 to either 2010 or zzso and reference lists of relevant zzso To identify ongoing trials we contacted researchers working on this topic and we scanned the National Institute of Health Register and the zzso Register zzso searched May zzso 

zzso controlled trials zzso comparing the use of an zzso with a control diet with regard to infection rate, zzso zzso time to first zzso episode, need for empirical zzso therapy, diet zzso and quality of life in adult and zzso cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of zzso 

Two review authors independently performed the study selection, zzso of zzso assessment and data zzso zzso were performed according to the guidelines of the Cochrane zzso for zzso zzso of zzso 

We identified three zzso assessing different intervention and control diets in 192 patients zzso zzso to intervention zzso 95 to control zzso with different types of zzso zzso zzso protective environment, zzso zzso central zzso zzso care, oral care, hygiene practices and zzso zzso and outcome definitions also differed between zzso In all included studies it was standard policy to give empirical antibiotics (and sometimes also zzso to zzso zzso the patients diagnosed with an zzso Two studies included adults and one study included zzso In all studies only a scant description of treatment regimens was zzso All studies had zzso zzso zzso of results of included studies was not zzso In two individual studies no statistically significant difference in infection rate between the intervention and control diet was zzso another study showed no significant difference in the number of chemotherapy cycles with an infection between the treatment zzso None of the studies mentioned zzso zzso but in one study no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment groups was zzso Time from onset of zzso to fever, the duration of empirical antibiotics and zzso diet zzso zzso following the diet easily and following the diet throughout all chemotherapy zzso and quality of life were all evaluated by only one study; for all outcomes no statistically significant differences between the treatment arms was zzso 

At the moment there is no evidence from individual zzso in children and adults with different zzso that underscores the use of an zzso for the prevention of infection and related zzso All studies differed with regard to zzso outcome zzso and intervention and control zzso Since pooling of results was not possible and all studies had serious zzso limitations, no definitive conclusions can be zzso It should be noted that zzso evidence of zzso as identified in this review, is not the same as zzso of no zzso Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for clinical zzso More high-quality research is zzso
