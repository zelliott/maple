In this paper we adapt an avascular zzso growth model to compare the effects of drug application on zzso zzso and on zzso zzso The model for the zzso is based on zzso driven growth of a zzso of live cells, whose birth and death generates volume changes described by a zzso zzso The drug is zzso as an zzso applied, zzso material capable of killing cells, both linear and zzso zzso for drug action on cells being zzso zzso solutions of the resulting system of partial differential equations for the zzso zzso case are compared with closed form solutions of the zzso case, particularly with respect to the effects on the cell kill of the drug dosage and of the duration of its zzso The results show an enhanced survival rate in zzso zzso compared to zzso cultures, consistent with experimental zzso and indicate that the key factor determining this is drug zzso An analysis of the large time zzso zzso response to a continuously applied drug at fixed concentration reveals up to three stable large time solutions, namely the trivial solution zzso a dead zzso a travelling wave zzso growing zzso and a zzso growth case in which cells reach a zzso in the zzso Each of these possibilities is formulated and zzso with the zzso between them being zzso zzso solutions reveal that the zzso solutions persist to a significantly higher drug dose than travelling wave zzso
