The zzso theory of zzso is briefly zzso and the zzso function predicted by the theory is expressed as an zzso zzso zzso power zzso This expression for the zzso function has the zzso approximation as the first zzso term and explicitly exhibits the dependence of the zzso function on the transition zzso It is then clear that if the transition rates are not small enough zzso zzso the zzso approximation is zzso zzso of one more term (in the series) leads to a better approximation in these zzso This is illustrated by a hypothetical zzso Other assumptions implicit in the theory are zzso
