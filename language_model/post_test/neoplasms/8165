Cancer is a genetic disease that ultimately results from the failure of cells to respond correctly to diverse zzso Signal zzso and signal integration are highly complex, requiring the zzso interaction of multiple zzso Classical zzso in model organisms including zzso zzso has been of immense use in identifying zzso components of zzso zzso zzso However, it is likely that there is much functional zzso in the informational processing machinery of zzso zzso we therefore need to develop methods for uncovering such redundant functions in model organisms if we are to use them to understand complex gene interactions and zzso zzso zzso may provide a powerful tool to probe zzso in informational zzso In this review, I set out some of the progress made so far by classical zzso in understanding zzso in gene networks, and outline how zzso may allow us to approach this problem more systematically in zzso zzso In particular, I discuss the use of zzso zzso screens in zzso zzso to identify synthetic lethal interactions and compare this with synthetic lethal interaction analysis in zzso zzso
