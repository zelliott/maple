Multiple roles within zzso have been assigned to zzso zzso 1 zzso making it an attractive candidate for zzso targeting of cancer zzso We have employed zzso zzso zzso to investigate the molecular zzso after targeted interference with zzso in zzso human colon zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in a dramatic increase of the zzso index followed by the onset of zzso zzso arrested cells displayed randomly separated condensed zzso and the occurrence of multiple zzso poles with zzso zzso zzso of zzso was strictly dependent on cell cycle zzso zzso engineered zzso cells with zzso expression of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso were completely zzso to zzso zzso zzso when they were arrested in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Various zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were investigated to explore the molecular consequences of zzso zzso Whereas most marker proteins showed similar zzso compared with treatment with zzso zzso was fully zzso solely in zzso cells but only partially zzso in zzso cells, although both treatments caused a profound zzso zzso This differential zzso of zzso was used to test whether a zzso inhibitor of zzso would exert the same cellular effects as interference with zzso on a zzso zzso It was found that the differential zzso mobility of zzso can serve as a reliable molecular marker to track zzso of zzso by zzso zzso within a zzso
