Using a multidisciplinary approach, we have measured various indicators of DNA damage in peripheral zzso of human populations potentially at increased risk for zzso Sister zzso exchanges zzso and zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso were evaluated in a group of zzso zzso aberrations and zzso zzso were evaluated in a group of cancer patients undergoing zzso therapy zzso zzso and zzso DNA were measured in cancer chemotherapy patients and in zzso preparing chemotherapy zzso and zzso and zzso zzso are being measured in zzso army troops zzso in zzso Our results indicate that both zzso and zzso zzso levels were not elevated in zzso but that other factors such as smoking status and race were risk factors for increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to increase background rates of zzso aberrations and zzso of zzso zzso and there was a strong correlation between levels of zzso zzso damage sustained in zzso and in zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso of cancer patients treated with zzso showed higher levels of zzso and had a higher zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso preparing zzso drugs were found to acquire increased in zzso sensitivity to zzso induction by zzso mustard with increased lifetime duration of drug zzso A zzso zzso study was performed to identify environmental factors that zzso genetic damage in breast cancer zzso Women with benign breast masses and no apparent disease served as zzso zzso frequency, cloning efficiency, and zzso aberration frequency did not differ significantly among the three zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
