zzso at zzso sites or surrounding sequences have been reported to cause zzso zzso However, zzso errors can also occur without sequence zzso We investigated three tumor zzso genes for zzso zzso in zzso At a low frequency per zzso it was found in five of seven of the investigated zzso zzso of the zzso type 1 zzso zzso in two of three zzso of the zzso type 2 zzso zzso and in one of three zzso of the zzso sclerosis 2 zzso It was zzso in all of the human tumor zzso tested zzso zzso sporadic zzso zzso sporadic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as in cultured tumor cell lines and cultured primary zzso zzso our data show that zzso zzso is a very common zzso According to simulations of the secondary structures of the zzso we suggest that zzso zzso is attributable to the rare occurrence of alternative structures at the zzso donor site, which are not recognized by the zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso is found to be increased at elevated temperatures and low pH in zzso conditions often found in tumor zzso In three tumor zzso tested for one zzso zzso we found approximately twice the amount of zzso transcript as in normal zzso zzso we suggest that the increase in zzso zzso caused by environmental factors represents an additional mechanism for the reduction of the amount of tumor zzso zzso in the absence of relevant zzso in the zzso
