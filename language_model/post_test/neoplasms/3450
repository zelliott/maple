In an effort to determine putative functional relationships between gene expression patterns and drug activity patterns of 60 human cancer cell lines, a novel method was developed to discover local associations within cell line zzso The association of zzso pairs is an zzso way of discovering gene markers that predict clinical tumor sensitivity to zzso Nine zzso networks were discovered, as well as dozens of zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso networks with well studied members were discussed and the literature shows that hypothetical functional relationships zzso zzso this method enables the gathering of new information beyond global zzso
