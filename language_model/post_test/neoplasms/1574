The present paper zzso the current knowledge about effects of zzso at temperatures used in clinical zzso on the peripheral nervous zzso From the experimental studies it may be concluded that the heat sensitivity of the nerve is determined by the sensitivity of the nerve zzso These studies show that in order to avoid induction of severe zzso application of heat to the peripheral nerves should not be in excess of doses of 30 zzso at 44 degrees C or zzso Using modern equipment for application of zzso zzso the zzso of even mild neurological complications is very zzso In zzso isolated limb zzso zzso zzso is an zzso side effect, this is in spite of the fact that in all studies a relatively mild zzso temperature is used that, based on the experimental studies, should be well tolerated by the nerves and other normal zzso in the zzso It seems that the zzso observed after zzso results from zzso enhancement of drug zzso very probably combined with effects of a high zzso pressure that is used to isolate the blood flow in the zzso Whole body zzso zzso using zzso and appropriate monitoring to avoid cardiovascular stress is at present considered a safe zzso Still in the recent past cases of zzso after treatment have been zzso When chemotherapy, and notably zzso is administered before or during zzso there are several clinical and experimental observations that indicate a limited tolerance of the peripheral nervous tissue in such zzso Also previous zzso may limit the tolerance of nerves to zzso notably when radiation is applied with a large field zzso Experimental studies show that combined treatment with radiation and heat leads to enhancement of effects of radiation zzso ratio approximately zzso at 60 zzso at 44 degrees zzso A clear zzso for the application of zzso in patients is the presence of a neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple zzso zzso is also required in the treatment of diabetic patients with zzso this based on experimental animal studies, but so far no clear clinical data are zzso
