The optimal treatment of patients with cancer depends on establishing accurate diagnoses by using a complex combination of clinical and zzso zzso In some instances, this task is difficult or impossible because of zzso clinical presentation or zzso To determine whether the diagnosis of multiple common adult zzso could be achieved purely by molecular zzso we subjected 218 tumor samples, spanning 14 common tumor types, and 90 normal tissue samples to zzso zzso gene expression zzso The expression levels of zzso genes and expressed sequence tags were used to evaluate the accuracy of a zzso zzso based on a support zzso machine zzso zzso zzso accuracy was zzso far exceeding the accuracy of random zzso zzso zzso differentiated zzso resulted in zzso predictions and could not be accurately classified according to their tissue of origin, indicating that they are zzso distinct entities with dramatically different gene expression patterns compared with their well differentiated zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate, zzso molecular cancer zzso and suggest a strategy for future clinical zzso of molecular cancer zzso
