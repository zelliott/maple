The recognition of the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most exciting recent advances in cell zzso In just ten years, since the description of the zzso potential of zzso by zzso et al in 1999 until now, zzso are being used in more than 150 clinical trials as therapeutic zzso The potential of these cells for zzso therapies relies on several key zzso zzso their capacity to differentiate into several cell zzso zzso their lack of zzso and their zzso zzso zzso their ex zzso expansion zzso zzso their ability to zzso soluble factors which regulate crucial biological functions such as proliferation and differentiation over a broad spectrum of target zzso and zzso their ability to home to damaged zzso and tumor zzso Based on these properties zzso are being exploited worldwide for a wide range of potential clinical applications including cell replacement strategies, treatment of zzso disease, zzso diseases and rejection after solid organ transplantation as well as their use as vehicles to deliver zzso zzso zzso the low inherent zzso of zzso means that they could be used not only for zzso but also for zzso cell zzso In addition, increasing evidence has revealed a complex relationship between zzso and zzso Thus, solid evidence has placed zzso transformed with specific zzso as the most likely cell of origin for certain zzso and zzso have been reported to both, inhibit or promote tumor growth depending on yet undefined zzso Here we will thoroughly discuss the different potential clinical applications of zzso as well as the role of zzso on zzso and the control of tumor zzso
