zzso damage caused by exposure to zzso chemicals and physical agents such as zzso radiation triggers production of generic zzso signals that mobilize the innate and acquired immune system to deal with the intrusion and effect tissue repair with the goal of maintaining the integrity of the tissue and the zzso zzso radiation appears to do the same, but less is known about the role of zzso signals in tissue responses to this zzso This review deals with the nature of putative zzso signals that may be generated by exposure to zzso radiation and their zzso There are a number of potential consequences of zzso signaling in response to radiation zzso zzso signals could mediate the zzso of, or recovery from, radiation zzso They could alter intrinsic cellular zzso or initiate zzso responses to subsequent zzso They may spread outside the locally damaged site and mediate bystander or zzso radiation zzso Finally, an important aspect of classical zzso signals is that they link initial zzso immune responses in a pathological site to the development of specific zzso zzso Interestingly, in the case of radiation, there is little evidence that zzso signals efficiently translate zzso tumor cell death into the generation of zzso immunity or normal tissue damage into zzso The suggestion is that zzso zzso signals may be inadequate in this respect or that radiation interferes with the generation of specific zzso There are many issues that need to be resolved regarding zzso signaling after exposure to zzso zzso Evidence of their importance is, in some areas, zzso but the issues are worthy of consideration, if for no other reason than that manipulation of these pathways has the potential to improve the therapeutic benefit of radiation zzso This article focuses on how normal zzso and tumors sense and respond to danger from zzso radiation, on the nature of the signals that are zzso and on the impact on the eventual consequences of zzso
