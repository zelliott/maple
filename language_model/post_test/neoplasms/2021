The optimal management of fever in zzso patients remains zzso zzso zzso infections are common and life-threatening but are difficult to diagnose zzso In this zzso study, we investigated the potential value of zzso administration of zzso B zzso no zzso zzso zzso in 132 patients remaining zzso and zzso despite zzso zzso therapy for four zzso 

The patients were divided into two groups: 68 who were randomly assigned to receive zzso zzso B, and 64 who were randomly assigned to continue only the protocol antibiotics that they were already zzso zzso B was administered zzso as zzso every other day at a dose of zzso zzso body weight or daily at a dose of zzso zzso body zzso Clinical response was evaluated as success or failure, depending upon the zzso course after zzso 

Based on the evolution of fever, the response rate was zzso in the group of patients receiving zzso zzso B and zzso for the other group zzso zzso zzso There were six documented (four zzso zzso infections in 64 patients zzso not to receive the zzso therapy as compared to only one zzso among 68 patients treated zzso with zzso B zzso zzso zzso No deaths due to zzso infection occurred among the patients receiving zzso zzso B compared to four in the other group zzso zzso zzso However, this study did not demonstrate a difference in survival between the two groups of patients (with or without zzso zzso zzso The benefit of zzso administration of zzso B was primarily observed in specific zzso of patients, such as those who did not receive any zzso prophylaxis zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso those who were severely zzso zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso zzso patients with a clinically documented infection zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and patients older than 15 years of age zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso 

These data suggest a benefit for early zzso B treatment in zzso patients with continued fever despite zzso zzso
