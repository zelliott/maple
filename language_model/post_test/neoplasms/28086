To determine whether the addition of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso regimen in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy zzso with zzso stem-cell transplantation zzso decreases the zzso of zzso and fever, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Patients with solid tumors undergoing zzso with zzso were zzso to receive zzso antibiotics with either zzso 500 zzso orally every 8 hours or the same zzso regimen with zzso 300 zzso orally every 12 zzso zzso was started 48 hours before stem-cell zzso Patients were monitored to document the occurrence of zzso and fever, zzso and cause of bacterial infection, time to onset and duration of fever, requirement for intravenous zzso and length of hospital zzso 

zzso patients were zzso to receive zzso and 65 to receive zzso plus zzso and from these groups, 62 and 61 were zzso zzso The proportion of patients who developed zzso and fever was zzso in the group treated with zzso and zzso in the group treated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although there was a trend toward a reduction in the overall zzso of zzso (12 v 4 zzso and zzso zzso (8 v 2 zzso with the addition of zzso none of these comparisons was statistically significant zzso zzso and P zzso zzso 

The results of this study, which demonstrate that zzso does not improve zzso zzso prophylaxis in cancer patients undergoing zzso with zzso support but that it does increase the occurrence of zzso side effects, do not support the routine use of zzso in this zzso
