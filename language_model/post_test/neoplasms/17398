It is suggested that apart from zzso plant medicinal preparations containing active compounds zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be responsible for some human zzso in Nigeria and perhaps other parts of zzso zzso in this paper, a hypothesis is put forward that these compounds or their zzso zzso types may form zzso from the zzso double bonds which may bind tissue zzso DNA, zzso and protein leading to one of the vital steps of environmental zzso in zzso This hypothesis has far reaching implications for, besides the examples given, zzso plant preparations are widely used in various parts of Africa within traditional methods of zzso Our observation is based on information we now have about zzso and is not intended to confirm the roles of double bonds in a vinyl zzso system of the active zzso
