To determine the zzso dose zzso zzso toxicity zzso safety, zzso and zzso of zzso when administered as a zzso infusion every 21 days to patients with advanced solid tumors or zzso zzso 

Patients who failed prior standard therapy or those without any standard options were zzso zzso patients were enrolled using an initial accelerated zzso phase followed by a standard zzso zzso An additional 20 patients were enrolled at the recommended phase II dose to obtain additional safety and zzso zzso The doses evaluated ranged from 2 to 8 zzso The zzso of zzso was evaluated at 19 zzso over 48 h following during administration during cycle zzso zzso was assessed by the zzso Common zzso zzso version zzso Response evaluation was performed every 6 zzso 

The most common and consistent zzso was zzso Other zzso observed included zzso pulmonary zzso zzso syndrome, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso as a zzso infusion every 21 days was established as 4 zzso The maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration time curve appeared to increase zzso to zzso One durable objective response was seen in a patient with zzso zzso who was on treatment 11 months and 6 patients had stable disease for over four zzso 

The recommended phase II dose of zzso on this specific schedule of a zzso infusion every 3 weeks is 4 zzso The promising efficacy and lack of severe zzso in this study warrant the continued development of zzso
