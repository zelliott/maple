The present study was designed to determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated doses of oral intermittent oral zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and its zzso were also zzso 

A total of 27 patients were treated at four dose levels of zzso zzso or 1000 zzso twice daily orally, days zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso three times zzso zzso zzso and its zzso were analyzed in plasma using liquid zzso zzso in ten zzso 

The toxicity of combined zzso and zzso was zzso Patients experienced mild zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso syndrome was seen in zzso of patients and was generally mild, as was zzso zzso zzso toxicity included zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The dose level recommended for further trials included zzso 1000 zzso twice daily and zzso zzso zzso three times zzso One patient had a partial response of a liver zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso parameters of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso were similar to those reported by other zzso There was rapid conversion to zzso The peak plasma zzso of zzso occurred between zzso and zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso was well zzso The recommended dose levels for phase II trials are: zzso zzso zzso zzso three times weekly and oral zzso 1000 zzso twice daily for 2 zzso No evidence of an effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso or its zzso was zzso A phase II trial in zzso patients with zzso zzso is zzso
