zzso data has been shown recently to be zzso in distinguishing closely related cell types that often appear in different forms of cancer, but is not yet practical zzso However, the data might be used to construct a minimal set of marker genes that could then be used clinically by making zzso zzso to diagnose a specific type of zzso Here a replication zzso is used for this zzso It zzso an ensemble of zzso all using different combinations of genes to generate a set of optimal zzso 

We apply this method to the leukemia data of the zzso group that attempts to zzso diagnose two kinds of zzso and also to data of Khan et zzso to distinguish four different kinds of childhood zzso In the latter case we were able to reduce the number of genes needed from 96 to less than 15, while at the same time being able to zzso all of their test data zzso We also apply this method to two other cases, zzso large zzso zzso data zzso et zzso zzso and data of zzso et zzso on zzso diagnosis of 14 common tumor zzso
