Recent technological advances have opened the door for the fast and cost-effective generation of genetically engineered mouse models zzso to study zzso We describe here a zzso novel approach for the generation of zzso zzso based on the controlled introduction of various genetic elements in embryonic stem cells zzso that are derived from existing mouse strains with a predisposition for zzso The isolation of zzso zzso lines is greatly facilitated by the availability of the newly defined culture media containing zzso that effectively preserve zzso zzso The feasibility of the zzso approach is discussed in light of current literature and placed into the context of existing zzso This approach will allow for fast and flexible validation of candidate cancer genes and drug targets and will result in a zzso of zzso lines and corresponding zzso collections that enable easy distribution and use of zzso models to the wider scientific zzso
