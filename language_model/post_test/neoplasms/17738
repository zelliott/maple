Figure 2 illustrates a suggested mechanism of zzso This scheme takes into account the effect of zzso at different integration zzso zzso zzso and zzso Any of these levels may be age zzso zzso changes in the activity of zzso responsible for zzso and zzso of zzso and variations in zzso of lipids and proteins contributing to the transport of zzso agents into cells, may play an important role in the zzso effect of age on zzso The effects of zzso changes in DNA repair need zzso However, they are thought to exert a zzso influence on the zzso rise in tumor zzso It seems that zzso activity of target zzso is the important zzso factor of zzso zzso changes of regulation at tissue and zzso levels are also powerful factors in zzso zzso zzso changes in the neuroendocrine system provide conditions for zzso zzso and promotion of zzso On the other hand, zzso per zzso (especially chemical and zzso may intensify aging processes in the zzso zzso by drugs, of zzso shifts requiring synthetic and energetic changes of a transformed tumor cells, and of zzso shifts, may exert both zzso and zzso zzso
