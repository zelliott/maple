A software program zzso has been developed to perform patient specific zzso quality assurance zzso zzso for intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso using zzso maps measured with an electronic portal imaging device zzso The software converts the zzso acquired images of each zzso zzso to zzso maps that are equivalent to those calculated by the treatment planning system zzso The software has the capability to process zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present investigation, several zzso plans for different treatment sites were used to validate the software using the zzso zzso 1000 zzso with the zzso zzso A total of 20 zzso plans of different treatment sites were zzso zzso zzso dose profiles, dose volume zzso zzso and gamma analysis comparisons were performed to evaluate the accuracy of our zzso A gamma index analysis of the zzso zzso plane was done for each plan and showed an average of zzso of gamma passing rate using a zzso and 3 zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso and dose profile comparisons were conducted between the original calculated plan and the measured reconstructed plan from the zzso images processed through the zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso can be used clinically for patient specific zzso zzso providing a comprehensive zzso zzso evaluation through zzso comparison as well as an option for a zzso gamma zzso
