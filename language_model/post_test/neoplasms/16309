zzso Mouse studies have indicated that the zzso effects of zzso acid zzso are dramatically zzso in combination with other drugs, and it has been proposed that zzso of the therapeutic potential of zzso would exploit combination zzso The aim was to identify the most appropriate animal model for further investigations of the zzso of possible zzso combinations and their zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso profile for zzso in liver zzso was similar in zzso zzso rabbit and humans, with zzso and zzso the two major zzso zzso In all species, the intrinsic clearance by zzso was at least zzso that due to zzso There was significant zzso in the in zzso kinetic parameters zzso zzso with the mouse being the least efficient zzso zzso compared with the other zzso zzso zzso rat and rabbit zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity, but only the rabbit showed zzso For the total in zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso the ratio of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso rat and rabbit zzso However, taking into account the liver and kidney weight difference, it is apparent that the in zzso zzso metabolism would not be a major contributor to the overall elimination of zzso zzso The zzso profile for liver zzso zzso was similar across species, but there was remarkable zzso zzso in the zzso of liver zzso zzso zzso zzso of in zzso intrinsic clearance to in zzso gave a significant zzso of plasma clearance for all zzso However, there was a significant zzso relationship for plasma clearance and volume of distribution, but not for maximum tolerated dose across zzso zzso The results indicate that animal models may have a limited role in the zzso to patients of drug interactions with agents such as zzso that have zzso activity that may vary widely between zzso
