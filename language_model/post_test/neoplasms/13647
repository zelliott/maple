zzso levels of zzso beta zzso soluble zzso 2 receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso were measured to predict some characteristics of zzso episodes in children with cancer and zzso Forty-eight episodes of zzso zzso were determined in 23 pediatric cancer patients, including 35 zzso episodes without identifiable source, 7 episodes of zzso due to zzso organisms and 4 due to zzso organisms, and 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were significantly higher at the beginning of the zzso episodes than those of controls zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were higher in patients with zzso due to zzso organisms than in those with zzso ones zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were similar in zzso episodes and controls zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso and zzso levels may be helpful in the prediction of infection in zzso cancer patients with zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were not useful for identifying the presence and the type of infection in zzso zzso episodes in zzso
