The zzso of cancer increases with age in humans and in laboratory animals zzso There are different patterns of age-related distribution of tumors in different zzso and zzso Aging may increase or decrease the zzso of various zzso to initiation of zzso and usually zzso promotion and progression of zzso Aging may zzso to cancer by several zzso zzso tissue zzso of cells in late stages of zzso zzso zzso in zzso in particular, zzso in immune and zzso system and zzso zzso instability linking aging and increased cancer zzso Increased zzso to the effects of tumor promoters is found both in aged animals and aged humans, as predicted by the zzso model of zzso Available evidence supporting the relevance of zzso zzso of human cells and zzso biology to human cancer seems quite strong, however, the evidence linking cellular zzso to human aging is controversial and required additional zzso Data on the acceleration of aging by zzso agents as well as on increased cancer risk in patients with premature aging are critically zzso In genetically modified mouse models zzso knockout or zzso characterized by the aging zzso the zzso of tumors usually similar to those in controls, whereas the zzso period of tumor development is zzso Practically all models of accelerated of aging in genetically modified animals show the increase in the zzso and the reduction in the zzso of zzso Strategies for cancer prevention must include not only measures to minimize exposure to zzso zzso agents, but also measures to zzso the age-related zzso in internal zzso zzso zzso drugs zzso may either postpone population aging and increase of tumor zzso or decrease the mortality in zzso individuals in populations and inhibit zzso At least some zzso may increase the survival of a zzso individuals in populations but increase the zzso of zzso
