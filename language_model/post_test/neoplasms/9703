To determine the zzso and zzso of zzso given daily for 7 days of a zzso zzso zzso response and changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in tumor and skin tissue were zzso and zzso of potential zzso in plasma was zzso 

This was a zzso phase I study in patients with advanced solid zzso Patients were evaluated for safety, zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso status, were assessed in tumor and skin tissue using zzso and zzso zzso Plasma zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated using zzso zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled in the zzso zzso toxicity zzso persistent zzso and mouth zzso was observed at 750 zzso The maximum tolerated dose was 650 zzso There were no confirmed objective zzso zzso treatment showed zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso in a variety of tumor zzso and up regulation of zzso in skin zzso Plasma zzso was reduced following zzso administration, but no consistent change in vascular zzso growth factor, zzso or zzso zzso was zzso zzso plasma zzso were zzso to zzso 

The safety and zzso profile of zzso was favorable for zzso oral zzso Evidence of zzso of zzso zzso activity in tumor and skin tissue was accompanied by changes in markers of proliferation and cell cycle zzso Additional clinical trials are warranted in defining the role of zzso in the treatment of cancer and further assessing the utility of zzso zzso
