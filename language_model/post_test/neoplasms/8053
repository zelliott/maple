This paper uses two case studies of zzso Department of Energy nuclear weapons complex installations to illustrate the integration of expedited site characterization zzso and multimedia modeling in the remedial action decision making zzso zzso SITE zzso zzso zzso AND zzso SITE zzso Conceptual site models outline assumptions about contaminates and the zzso distribution of potential zzso Multimedia models simulate contaminant transport and fate through multiple environmental media, estimate potential human exposure via specific exposure zzso and estimate the risk of cancer and zzso health zzso zzso relies on using monitoring data to zzso the key components of an initial conceptual site model that is modified zzso using the multimedia zzso 

Two case studies are presented that used the zzso approach: Los Alamos National Laboratory zzso and zzso zzso released zzso metals, and organic compounds, into zzso surrounding the zzso The zzso Plant has past waste management operations which included burning chemical zzso in unlined pits, burying zzso in unlined zzso and discharging plant zzso into on-site surface zzso 

The case studies indicate that using multimedia models with the zzso approach can inform zzso about what, where, and how much site characterization data needs to be collected to reduce the uncertainty associated with risk zzso zzso the degree of uncertainty reduces the time and cost associated with assessing potential risk and increases the confidence that decision makers have in the assessments zzso
