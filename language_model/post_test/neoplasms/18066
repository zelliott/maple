The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as a zzso of several zzso processes that are active during tumor invasion and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and cell zzso The structural basis for the high affinity interaction between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which focuses cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso is now thoroughly characterized by zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso In contrast, the structural basis for the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso which is involved in the regulation of cell zzso and zzso remains to be zzso In this study, we have identified the functional zzso on zzso that is responsible for its interaction with the zzso extended form of zzso by using a comprehensive zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positions zzso Interestingly, the five zzso identified as zzso zzso for zzso binding form a zzso zzso consisting of two exposed zzso connecting the central zzso zzso in zzso domain I zzso zzso and zzso as well as a zzso region of the flexible zzso zzso connecting zzso zzso I and II zzso and zzso This binding zzso provides the molecular basis for the observation that zzso can form a zzso complex with zzso and zzso Furthermore, it raises the intriguing possibility that the zzso zzso and inhibitor for zzso zzso and zzso may have reached a zzso solution for binding to the zzso B domain of zzso
