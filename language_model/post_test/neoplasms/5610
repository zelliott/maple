zzso body cavity zzso sometimes cannot be distinguished from zzso ones by conventional zzso The authors performed zzso in zzso zzso zzso on zzso slides using zzso specific zzso to see if zzso zzso cells could be detected in 20 body cavity zzso The results were then compared with those of conventional zzso 

A total of 20 body cavity zzso from 19 patients were studied using conventional zzso and zzso zzso specific for zzso 3, 8, 10, and 12 were used to detect zzso on zzso slides zzso Corporation, zzso zzso 

A total of 13 patients had zzso conditions zzso prior history of zzso or the presence of zzso anywhere in the zzso Conventional zzso and FISH were both positive in 5 of these patients (6 zzso and negative in 2 zzso The results for one sample were zzso by both zzso There were 5 zzso zzso results in patients with zzso zzso One sample was positive by FISH and negative by zzso one was positive by FISH and zzso by zzso and three were zzso by FISH and negative by zzso FISH results were either negative (in 4 zzso or zzso (in 2 zzso in the 6 patients with benign zzso 

FISH can detect zzso zzso cells in body cavity zzso and is especially useful when the major cell population consists of zzso cells that cannot be differentiated from zzso or zzso zzso It is less useful in detecting a small population of zzso cells hidden in an inflammatory or zzso cell zzso More studies are needed to establish diagnostic criteria further and to assess the clinical usefulness of this zzso
