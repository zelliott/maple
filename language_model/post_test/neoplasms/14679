The zzso zzso zzso and zzso reacting specifically with human zzso 19 (40 zzso have been tested by zzso zzso methods for their reaction with a wide range of human zzso and cultured zzso zzso zzso and their zzso showed a zzso positive reaction with greater than zzso of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso were zzso while benign breast zzso and a zzso zzso show a mosaic pattern of stained and zzso zzso zzso These three zzso patterns were also seen in cultured zzso Positive homogeneous zzso was seen in all breast cancer cell lines examined with the exception of zzso which exhibits stem cell zzso and which showed the zzso pattern of zzso seen in milk cell zzso zzso lines and zzso two cell lines from cervical zzso and three zzso transformed breast zzso lines were zzso The zzso zzso and 17 are potentially useful zzso for distinguishing zzso (and their zzso from zzso zzso and from zzso zzso They may also discriminate between benign and zzso breast zzso and identify a specific differentiation zzso in the zzso cell zzso
