To develop and validate a method of zzso the intensity of pediatric zzso treatments using four zzso defined categories of treatment zzso 

An earlier version of a rating scale, the intensity of treatment rating zzso was revised and validated in two zzso In the zzso Construction phase, three criterion zzso revised the zzso items based on consensus and item agreement data from pediatric zzso zzso (N zzso zzso In the zzso zzso phase, the new zzso items were validated using a second set of pediatric zzso external to our institution (N zzso zzso In addition, a third group of zzso (N zzso zzso was employed to assess zzso zzso for 12 patients at varying levels of treatment zzso 

zzso between criterion ratings and the median of external zzso for all 34 items on the zzso was very high zzso zzso zzso range zzso When the zzso was used to rate 12 patient examples, the zzso agreement among pediatric zzso was also very high zzso agreement between zzso zzso r zzso zzso overall zzso among 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The revised zzso zzso zzso zzso is a valid and reliable scale for zzso the intensity of pediatric zzso zzso
