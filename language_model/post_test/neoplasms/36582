Occupational exposure to wood dust zzso or chemically zzso is associated with an increased risk of developing zzso of the zzso zzso The specific zzso agents, zzso wood dust alone zzso zzso wood dust with zzso used in the processing or manufacturing of wood products, and/or physical zzso of wood dust and the associated risk factors, are not known or zzso The strongest association of exposure to wood dust and development of zzso cancer is observed in those zzso where workers are exposed to hard wood dust and chemical zzso are not zzso The time between first occupational exposure to wood dust and the development of zzso of the zzso cavity averages 40 years zzso zzso zzso The zzso data available are not sufficient to make a definitive assessment between wood dust exposure and increased risk for cancer other than zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso of wood dust to laboratory animals or in zzso with animal or microbial cells have not been thoroughly zzso Thus there is no direct experimental evidence on the potential hazards of wood zzso Data are insufficient or lacking on 1) wood dust exposure levels in ambient air and worker's breathing zone, and the deposition in the zzso zzso 2) hard zzso soft wood zzso 3) particle size and zzso 4) chemical composition of wood dust and the extent of contamination with chemical zzso and 5) interaction between zzso wood dust, chronic zzso and tobacco zzso These data are required so that one can understand the association between wood dust exposure and zzso cavity tumors, along with demographic differences in cancer rates, and to develop strategies for intervention and reduction of disease causing agents in order to reduce risk to wood industry zzso
