zzso analyses were performed on blood samples of 12 patients undergoing treatment with zzso zzso and radiation therapy for a variety of zzso zzso zzso oral doses of 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 g of zzso showed a linear relationship between maximum recorded plasma zzso and the dose in grams zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso plasma levels were observed by 30 zzso in most patients ingesting up to 6 g of zzso In marked contrast, five out of six patients ingesting 10 g of zzso demonstrated increasing plasma levels at least up to 3 h zzso zzso up to 6 g were well tolerated and resulted in average maximum recorded plasma levels zzso zzso 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of 10 g were generally not well zzso but a high plasma level was maintained on average for at least 4 zzso Plasma zzso of the above order have been previously associated with zzso enhancement of radiation damage in mouse tumor zzso This suggests that zzso can be expected to occur in human tumors following oral administration of a safe and well tolerated dose of 6 zzso However, at higher doses zzso 10 zzso the zzso and perhaps zzso may differ zzso
