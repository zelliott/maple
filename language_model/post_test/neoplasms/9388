To clarify the relationship between zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso we examined whether the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A enhanced zzso zzso in gastric tumor zzso zzso cells exposed to 20 zzso of X rays increased the zzso zzso activity and the expression of regulatory proteins zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso phase, followed by zzso of the zzso checkpoint, whereas the treatment of zzso zzso cells with 20 zzso zzso A suppressed the increase in the zzso zzso activity and expression of the zzso regulatory proteins and reduced the fraction of the cells in the zzso phase in the cell zzso Furthermore, this treatment resulted in not only a significant increase in zzso zzso but also the loss of zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso family members zzso and zzso and zzso family members zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells with and without X rays was significantly lower than for cells exposed to X rays zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso A zzso zzso through the enhancement of active fragments of zzso zzso
