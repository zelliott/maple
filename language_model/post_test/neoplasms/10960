An unstable zzso is a hallmark of many zzso It is zzso however, whether some zzso features driving zzso zzso in cancer are zzso in the zzso sequence and whether they can operate in a zzso zzso We performed a zzso analysis of zzso DNA zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso cancer samples classified into 26 cancer zzso Many zzso zzso are zzso clustered in cancer zzso We observed a significant enrichment for zzso sequences zzso in the vicinity of zzso zzso and established that zzso show a strand bias consistent with zzso structural zzso zzso abnormal zzso near zzso regions is a common signature for many zzso zzso zzso We propose a zzso hypothesis that abnormal zzso in zzso regions enriched for zzso acts as a zzso factor driving zzso zzso landscapes in zzso
