There are large geographical variations of cancer mortality rates in the United zzso In a series of ecological studies in the zzso a number of zzso factors including alcohol, diet, ethnic background, poverty, smoking, solar zzso zzso and zzso residence have been linked to many types of zzso Air pollution also plays a role in cancer zzso 

Cancer mortality rates averaged by state for two zzso zzso and zzso were used in zzso zzso analyses with respect to many of the zzso factors mentioned with the addition of an air pollution index in the form of a map of acid deposition in zzso This index is correlated with emissions from coal-fired power zzso In addition, lung cancer mortality rates for five-year periods from zzso to zzso were used in multiple linear zzso analyses including air pollution and cigarette zzso 

The air pollution index correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso female, blood and skin zzso Air pollution was estimated to account for zzso of male cancer deaths and zzso of female cancer deaths between zzso Solar zzso was zzso correlated with all these types of cancer except the zzso skin and cervical zzso zzso smoking was directly linked to lung cancer but not to other types of cancer in this zzso 

zzso of zzso diesel fuel and wood is the likely source of air pollution that affects cancer risk on a large scale, through production of black carbon zzso with zzso zzso aromatic zzso
