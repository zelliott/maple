In zzso zzso zzso in tumors were performed to evaluate the potential of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an imaging tool in human zzso 

Three hundred zzso human tumors were investigated for their zzso content by in zzso zzso zzso on tissue sections with zzso For comparison, zzso receptors zzso were measured in adjacent sections of these tumors with zzso 

zzso were characterized and localized in the zzso cells of most breast zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso gastrointestinal zzso cell zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among neuroendocrine tumors, all differentiated and one-half of zzso zzso tumors, zzso zzso lung zzso zzso and inactive zzso zzso were found to express zzso In general, zzso were found much more frequently than zzso but only 5 of 19 growth zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso or Ewing zzso had zzso In all tumors tested, the zzso were of high affinity and specific for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso between zzso and SS could be zzso 

Most human zzso express zzso as measured by in zzso zzso zzso These data represent the molecular basis for evaluation of zzso imaging of these tumors in zzso and predict its great potential zzso
