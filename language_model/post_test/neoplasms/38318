In view of the commercial success of integrated zzso zzso there is an increasing interest in comparable zzso zzso zzso in combination with CT enables a direct correlation of zzso information and functional information, resulting in better zzso and definition of zzso zzso Besides zzso zzso the added value of CT zzso is based on the zzso correction capabilities of zzso The number of clinical studies is zzso but pilot studies have indicated a higher specificity and a significant reduction in indeterminate zzso The superiority of zzso over zzso imaging or zzso has been demonstrated in bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and adrenal zzso zzso Also, rates of detection of zzso zzso by biopsy can be increased with zzso This review highlights recent technical developments in integrated zzso systems and summarizes the current literature on potential clinical uses and future directions for zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
