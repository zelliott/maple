The Human Genome Project and zzso have led to a better appreciation of the importance of common genetic variation in determining cancer risk, created potential for predicting response to therapy, and made possible the development of targeted prevention and therapeutic zzso Advances in molecular epidemiology can be used to explore the role of genetic variation in modulating the risk for severe and persistent symptoms, such as pain, depression, and fatigue, in patients with zzso The same genes that are implicated in cancer risk might also be involved in the zzso of therapeutic zzso For example, zzso in several zzso genes are potential markers for genetic zzso both for cancer risk and for zzso zzso These genetic zzso are stable markers and easily and reliably zzso to explore the extent to which genetic variation might prove useful in identifying patients with cancer at high-risk of symptom zzso Likewise, they could identify zzso who might benefit most from symptom intervention, and contribute to developing personalized and more effective therapies for persistent zzso
