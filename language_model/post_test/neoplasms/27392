The primary goal of zzso treatments is to attain zzso however toxicity could affect the course of the zzso zzso have been proposed for comparing two treatments on the basis of the joint distribution for safety and efficacy zzso but they do not take into account the cumulative doses of drugs zzso or radiation zzso received by each zzso Moreover, these methods assume a zzso form for the joint zzso In this paper we define a zzso zzso including toxicity and efficacy outcomes and the dose at which one, none or both zzso Each patient is classified into an ordered category depending on the order of occurrence of these two criteria: the sooner the patient benefits from efficacy and/or the later zzso experiences zzso the better is the zzso We then apply likelihood ratio tests with ordered zzso This procedure requires constrained maximum likelihood zzso via zzso zzso A large set of simulations compares the proposed tests to other more usual tests and the results show a good power and a satisfactory type I error zzso Our approach is illustrated with a zzso zzso clinical trial involving patients with zzso zzso germ cell zzso
