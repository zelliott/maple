Recent development in stem cell biology has indicated a new possible approach for the treatment of neurological zzso However, in spite of tremendous hope generated, we are still on the way to understand if the use of stem cells to repair mature brain and spinal zzso is a reliable zzso In particular, we know very little on the in zzso regulation of adult neural zzso and this also zzso impact on cell transplant zzso In this chapter we will discuss issues concerning the role and function of stem cells in neurological diseases, with regard to the impact of features of zzso zzso and zzso cells on in zzso stem zzso Stem cell location and biology in the adult brain, brain host reaction to zzso neural stem cell reaction to experimental injuries and possibilities for zzso regulation are the main topics zzso
