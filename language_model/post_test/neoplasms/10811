Gene expression signatures developed to measure the activity of zzso signaling pathways have been used to dissect the zzso of tumor samples and to predict sensitivity to various cancer drugs that target components of the relevant zzso thus potentially identifying therapeutic options for zzso of zzso To facilitate broad use, including in a clinical setting, the ability to generate data from zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso 

zzso of zzso activity in matched zzso and zzso zzso tumor samples were generated using the zzso Premier methodology in combination with zzso using zzso zzso zzso generated were compared with those obtained from zzso samples using a standard zzso zzso In addition, gene expression data from patient matched zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso to evaluate the consistency of predictions of zzso signaling zzso zzso 

zzso correlation was observed between zzso activity predictions from paired zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso In addition, significant zzso of zzso activity predictions was also observed between patient matched zzso and zzso zzso 

Reliable and consistent predictions of zzso zzso activities can be obtained from zzso tumor tissue zzso The ability to reliably zzso zzso patient tumor tissue samples for zzso analyses will lead to a better understanding of the biology of disease progression and, in the clinical setting, will provide tools to guide the choice of zzso to those most likely to be effective in treating a patient's zzso
