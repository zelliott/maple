zzso zzso zzso has been clinically used for imaging zzso zzso tumors, and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an attractive zzso for PET imaging and is produced with high specific activity using a small biomedical zzso The aim of this study is to produce and fundamentally examine a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso produced using a biomedical zzso was reacted with zzso for 30 zzso at 45 degrees zzso The stability of zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso with zzso and in zzso zzso collected after zzso by zzso zzso zzso studies were performed in normal mice by administration of mixed solution of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice by administration of zzso or zzso zzso zzso The tumor was zzso using zzso zzso and zzso with an animal PET zzso 

zzso can be produced in amounts sufficient for clinical study with high zzso zzso zzso was stable in zzso but zzso zzso to protein was observed after injection into zzso In zzso studies, the zzso of zzso was higher than that of zzso in all zzso except zzso In zzso mice, zzso showed a high zzso in the zzso and the zzso ratio reached as high as zzso zzso zzso at 6 h after zzso zzso showed significantly higher zzso in the tumor than zzso zzso PET showed a very clear image of the zzso which was comparable to that of zzso PET and very similar to that of zzso 

zzso clearly zzso a zzso zzso tumor and seemed to be a potential PET zzso in the clinical zzso
