The technique of zzso zzso zzso zzso is reviewed from an historical perspective with a summary of the literature since the first experiments were performed in zzso Attention is given to both the biological and zzso properties of the various zzso that have been zzso zzso to critical discoveries and competing technologies in the zzso literature are zzso Topics include: synthesis of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso delivery, zzso selection based on zzso properties, light delivery for specific applications, oxygen requirements, and other zzso zzso A mathematical model of the dynamics for cell killing based upon the transport of zzso to the cell surface is zzso A generalized set of coupled differential equations is given, which zzso summarizes the zzso requirements stressed earlier for successful cell zzso Solutions are then presented for an idealized set of conditions appropriate for an isolated tumor zzso Suggestions for further improvements and follow-up experiments are made that could help in the evolution of zzso into a useful clinical therapy and/or probe for cell biological zzso
