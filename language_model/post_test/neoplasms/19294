During tumor zzso multiple genetic changes in the zzso vastly alter the zzso of zzso Some of these changes, including the zzso of various growth regulatory genes as well as zzso in the zzso of a large number of zzso may lead to resistance to zzso zzso capturing such zzso information of the tumors would enable a physician to decide on the course of treatment options clinically zzso Currently, it is still not feasible to identify all the genetic zzso that have occurred in a patient's cancer zzso However, the advent of DNA zzso coupled with the completion of the human zzso sequence and the identification of all its zzso have made possible zzso gene expression profiling of the cancer zzso In this review, we will focus on the application of expression zzso for identifying signature gene expression profiles in primary zzso to predict response to either zzso or zzso We envision that zzso profiling of the cancer zzso ultimately will not only reveal how altered gene expression results in resistance to treatment, but also be exploited for predicting and zzso cancer zzso
