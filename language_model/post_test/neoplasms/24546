zzso tumor zzso zzso are a well-established 3-D in zzso model system that reflects the zzso in zzso situation in tumor zzso and of avascular zzso zzso Because zzso and other immune cells zzso into zzso of different origin, such zzso zzso are a valuable, still underestimated tool to systematically study zzso interactions between tumor and immune zzso The present article gives a brief overview on work that has been published on zzso cell interactions in zzso and also summarizes mechanisms of immune suppression in the tumor milieu zzso on zzso zzso Using the zzso model, we recently demonstrated that zzso zzso acid is a potent zzso of human zzso as zzso acid inhibited the differentiation of zzso zzso into zzso cells zzso and also impaired zzso zzso We show zzso that the capacity of various tumor cells in zzso to zzso zzso acid differs up to zzso suggesting that this capacity is dependent on the tumor cell zzso It is further demonstrated that zzso acid zzso the migration of zzso into zzso as zzso could be increased by blocking zzso acid zzso We therefore discuss zzso acid which accumulates in many tumors and tumor zzso as a potent immune zzso for zzso in the tumor milieu and conclude that these data are highly relevant for adoptive zzso protocols with zzso
