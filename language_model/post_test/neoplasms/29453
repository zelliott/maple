zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso death member of the zzso family of zzso Its expression is induced by the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso under conditions of low oxygen zzso and is found over expressed in hypoxic regions of many zzso When over zzso zzso zzso cell death through induction of zzso dysfunction that is dependent on the presence of zzso TM zzso zzso we have determined that the zzso zzso cancer cell line expresses a truncated zzso zzso which results in the elimination of the zzso zzso zzso that eliminates all four zzso of zzso protein also zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three different zzso in a zzso expression zzso that lead to a truncated zzso zzso lacking TM domain only, or lacking CD, zzso and TM zzso resulted in zzso of zzso cell death when zzso into zzso zzso We found that truncated zzso failed to associate with the zzso and the truncated zzso lacking all four zzso can bind to wild type zzso Taken together, zzso of zzso could be a novel mechanism for cancer cells to avoid zzso cell death zzso by zzso over zzso
