Cancer affects approximately 1 in 3 zzso An zzso zzso to cancer is partly determined by environmental zzso and by the combination of inherited cancer zzso and resistance zzso zzso mapping of these low zzso cancer zzso genes has been done in the mouse because human low zzso genes are extremely difficult to find using traditional methods due to zzso and interacting zzso Also, the choice of candidate genes for human association studies can miss the unknown or zzso Mouse models also have limitations; it can be difficult to identify zzso zzso in the mouse because linkage zzso often extends across several zzso To exploit the strengths of both systems, we outline a zzso strategy to identify human zzso associated with increased cancer zzso This approach uses linkage analysis and zzso zzso imbalance in tumors, and gene expression studies in the zzso combined with association studies and tumor imbalance studies in humans to identify zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso in both mouse and human can then be used to better understand the mechanisms behind cancer risk and as targets for zzso
