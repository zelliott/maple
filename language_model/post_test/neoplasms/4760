We have previously isolated zzso a zzso zzso compound, from the brown zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso shows both zzso and zzso activity and thus is of special interest for the development of zzso and zzso agents against zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso exerts its zzso activity is poorly zzso Here, we show that zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso migration and invasion of zzso cells by scavenging zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso generation increases migration and invasion of zzso cells, which zzso with zzso zzso and increased expression and zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso suppresses zzso cell migration and zzso zzso treatment attenuated zzso zzso levels and zzso of zzso as well as expression and zzso of zzso zzso treatment also decreases complex formation of zzso as and expression of zzso 9, and zzso These results suggest that the zzso cascade enhances migration and invasion of zzso cells by inducing expression of zzso through zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, whereas zzso zzso zzso signaling through scavenging zzso zzso This finding provides new insights into the mechanisms by which zzso is able to suppress human cancer zzso and zzso zzso we suggest that zzso is a potential therapeutic agent for cancer zzso
