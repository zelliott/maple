zzso therapy zzso is a therapeutic zzso used for the treatment of a variety of solid zzso The principle of zzso is based on the selective zzso of a zzso chemical in tumor zzso followed by zzso of tumors with visible zzso The treatment results in a cascade of zzso events causing cell death both in zzso and in zzso zzso oxide zzso is a gaseous free zzso which is an important zzso of zzso zzso and zzso functions and plays an important role in the induction of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso from zzso zzso that displays zzso effects in zzso cell zzso Our previous studies have shown zzso induced zzso cell death in zzso zzso and other tumor zzso To better understand the zzso mechanism of zzso induced by zzso we hypothesized the role of NO in zzso which is considered to be involved in a variety of zzso and pathological zzso We first demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso a potential marker of NO zzso zzso zzso both at light zzso and electron microscopic zzso zzso zzso using specific zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso we observed that both zzso I and zzso II was present in all cell zzso The expression of both zzso I and zzso II was further verified using Western zzso analysis as early as 15 zzso post zzso compared to that of zzso zzso and light alone treated control zzso Our observation of NO production and distribution using the zzso method is direct evidence of NO production in zzso zzso
