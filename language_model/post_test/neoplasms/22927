zzso mouse leukemia cells provide a convenient model for examining the mechanisms and components involved in the active transport of various zzso and zzso One of these transport systems exhibits a broad specificity for folate compounds, including zzso zzso such as zzso The primary zzso for this system is zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso the principal circulating form of the vitamin in zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso are also taken up zzso but folate zzso zzso 100 zzso is a relatively poor zzso zzso for this system is zzso 15 zzso zzso Energy for zzso zzso is provided by an zzso zzso and regulation appears to be zzso by zzso zzso The system can be inhibited zzso by treatment of the cells with zzso zzso zzso or zzso folate zzso The latter method allows the zzso binding protein to be labeled in zzso thereby providing a means for identifying it during subsequent zzso and zzso zzso for this latter project is provided by previous experience in the zzso to zzso of a similar zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso cells also contain an efficient system for the transport of zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso zzso of zzso is linked with its conversion to zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso which have a close structural similarity to zzso (as well as to a portion of the folate zzso are also transported into zzso zzso Transport of zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso with Ki values of 42, 100 and 350 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and various other zzso were also good zzso of zzso zzso Present evidence indicates that zzso and zzso use separate transport systems, but isolation of the components of these systems may further delineate their zzso
