A zzso zzso system zzso the main signaling pathways involved in cancer is constructed based on the currently known zzso interaction zzso This system exhibits stationary protein zzso zzso on the cell's zzso These zzso zzso were determined through simulations and their zzso against zzso were zzso In a higher zzso level, it was possible to group the network zzso into distinct cell zzso and determine driver zzso that promote zzso zzso We find that driver zzso are not necessarily central in the network zzso but at least they are direct regulators of central components towards which zzso or through which zzso distinct cancer signaling zzso The predicted drivers are in agreement with those pointed out by diverse census of cancer genes recently performed for several human zzso Furthermore, our results demonstrate that cell zzso can evolve towards full zzso through distinct sequences of accumulated zzso In particular, the network model supports routes of zzso known for some tumor zzso Finally, the zzso network model is employed to evaluate the outcome of zzso targeted cancer zzso The major find is that zzso were additive in their effects and that the association of targeted drugs is necessary for cancer zzso
