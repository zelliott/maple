zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso zzso zzso in focal zzso and a critical zzso of zzso signaling in a variety of cells, including zzso cells zzso Here we describe a new function for zzso in the regulation of zzso functions in a zzso zzso manner during zzso zzso of zzso in primary zzso causes increases in zzso numbers, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso rescued these zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso with this possibility, zzso zzso was found to zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso also associated with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Further analysis in zzso primary zzso showed that zzso zzso could rescue zzso migration but not proliferation or zzso in zzso zzso we showed that deletion of zzso in zzso reduced tumor zzso in zzso which could be restored by zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso Together, these studies demonstrated a novel role for zzso zzso of zzso in the regulation of zzso function during zzso which may contribute to zzso proliferation and zzso
