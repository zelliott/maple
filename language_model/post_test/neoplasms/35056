zzso zzso which are directly visible changes in the DNA, have close associations to cancer development, zzso zzso and zzso genetic zzso Human zzso cultures can be used for zzso monitoring of genetic health because many zzso and genetic effects are caused by long-term zzso zzso We have investigated the sensitivities of zzso from zzso diseases to the induction of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and the correlations between the frequency of sister zzso exchanges zzso in peripheral zzso and zzso or daily ways of zzso zzso from patients with Down syndrome, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Bloom syndromes showed altered (usually zzso zzso to the induction of zzso aberrations and zzso by zzso and zzso in our zzso Mean zzso of baseline zzso in zzso from normal men with poor zzso have also been shown to be significantly higher than those in cells from men having good zzso The former cells have further been shown to have zzso sensitivities to the induction of zzso by zzso treatment compared to latter zzso zzso zzso also make the zzso to be more sensitive to zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso
