zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in cellular response to many different zzso zzso we studied the molecular mechanism of zzso induction by zzso a natural zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso significantly and zzso increased the level of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells but not zzso cells and zzso zzso Besides, the transformed zzso and zzso cells are more sensitive to zzso cell death and growth zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso decreased zzso of zzso and enhanced the sensitivity of zzso zzso cells to 30 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso with zzso zzso zzso enhanced the sensitivity to zzso cell death and growth zzso These results indicated that zzso expression regulates cellular sensitivity to zzso Besides, zzso zzso may facilitate as a novel strategy to promote the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso
