The transforming growth factor zzso zzso family embraces many growth factors including the zzso and bone zzso proteins zzso The pathways zzso by these growth factors are implicated in many fundamental biological processes such as early embryonic development, organ zzso and adult tissue zzso and in a large number of zzso including zzso The action of these pathways is often zzso which means that different cell types present different zzso responses to these zzso or that the response of one cell type to a certain zzso differs depending on the presence of other signaling proteins that stimulate the target cell together with zzso The latter usually reflects zzso stage or progression to a specific pathological zzso Not only diverse growth factors and zzso can influence the response of zzso to zzso but a single cell type may also show drastically different zzso outcomes to zzso or zzso signaling as compared to zzso zzso This review describes differential zzso outcomes of zzso and zzso signaling in normal embryonic or adult stem cells and eventually in cancer stem cells and the process of zzso zzso We also zzso evidence on the zzso antagonism between zzso and zzso signaling as established in vascular differentiation and the progression of tissue zzso and zzso The article ends by discussing possible advantages that the acquired knowledge of these signaling mechanisms offers to new regimes of cancer therapy and the zzso problem of drug resistance zzso by tumor initiating zzso
