zzso instability in its broadest sense is a feature of virtually all zzso zzso In addition to the zzso and/or gene zzso that appear to be a prerequisite for the acquisition of a zzso zzso human zzso exhibit other zzso of zzso zzso particular, a high degree of zzso Indeed, many studies have shown that zzso is an almost zzso feature of cancer cells, and it has been argued by some that the emergence of zzso cells is a necessary step during zzso The functional link between zzso instability and cancer is strengthened by the existence of several zzso zzso disorders of humans that are associated with a moderate to severe increase in the zzso of zzso These disorders include zzso zzso zzso syndrome, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso breakage syndrome, all of which are very rare and are inherited in a zzso zzso Analysis of the cells from such zzso individuals is clearly a potentially fruitful approach for zzso the genetic basis for instability in the zzso It is assumed that by identifying the underlying cause of genetic instability in these disorders, one can derive valuable information not only about the basis of particular genetic diseases, but also about the underlying causes of zzso instability in sporadic zzso in the general zzso In this article, we review the clinical and cellular properties of genetic instability disorders associated with cancer zzso In particular, we focus on the rapid advances made in our understanding of these disorders that have derived from the cloning of the genes zzso in each zzso Because in many instances the affected genes have zzso in lower zzso species, we shall discuss how studies in zzso in particular have proved valuable in our understanding of human diseases and predisposition to zzso
