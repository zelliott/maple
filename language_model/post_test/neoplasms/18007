Cancer is a disease that results from both genetic and zzso zzso zzso zzso and varying zzso of complex diseases such as cancer in zzso twins as well as genetically identical laboratory animals have long been attributed to differences in environmental zzso zzso evidence indicates, however, that disparities in gene expression resulting from variable modifications in DNA zzso and zzso structure in response to the environment also play a role in differential zzso to zzso Despite a growing consensus on the importance of zzso in the zzso of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to zzso zzso are incompletely zzso Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the zzso nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced zzso zzso are adequately zzso These major deficits in knowledge markedly impair our ability to understand fully the zzso of cancer and the importance of the zzso in diagnosing and preventing this devastating zzso
