Throughout this brief review I have emphasized the unique zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso that make this zzso zzso a novel, exciting and tangible target for tumor zzso The zzso repeating nature of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso chain, the zzso of these zzso and the expression of the zzso at the cell surface, are all central to the immune recognition of this zzso and must be acknowledged in the design of zzso zzso There are considerable difficulties associated with such a zzso Short, zzso peptides that associate with zzso class I molecules on the cell surface to induce zzso responses are not useful here; zzso must be expressed at the cell surface and this introduces the numerous problems associated with gene zzso Furthermore, generating zzso zzso molecules that resemble zzso zzso is not zzso Competitive zzso of zzso with zzso is often incomplete, and merely increasing inhibitor concentration results in cell zzso But treating tumors is also not zzso zzso zzso has many characteristics of the ideal zzso zzso and our understanding of the unique mechanism of zzso recognition on tumors and the appropriate vaccine designs to target this zzso is now zzso zzso mouse and zzso zzso models provide excellent zzso models to test zzso and vaccine strategies, and in zzso studies and zzso clinical trials in humans provide considerable cause for zzso The next few years in this field should certainly be zzso
