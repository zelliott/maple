We have previously developed a zzso tracking system, which adapts the zzso of a zzso 160 zzso to zzso monitored target zzso In this study, we exploit the use of a novel zzso zzso zzso imaging system for zzso zzso The unique zzso geometry of the imaging system allows the detection of target motion perpendicular to the treatment beam zzso the directions usually featuring steep dose zzso We zzso the imaging system either alone or in combination with an external surrogate monitoring zzso We equipped a zzso zzso zzso with two flat panel zzso one directly underneath the zzso head for motion monitoring and the other underneath the patient couch for geometric tracking accuracy zzso A zzso phantom with an embedded metal marker reproduced three patient breathing zzso For zzso tracking based on zzso imaging alone, marker position was detected at a frame rate of zzso zzso For the combined external and internal motion monitoring system, a total of only 85 zzso images were acquired prior to or in between the delivery of ten segments of an zzso zzso External motion was monitored with a zzso A correlation model between external and internal motion was zzso The real-time component of the zzso tracking procedure then relied solely on the correlation model zzso of internal motion based on the external zzso Geometric tracking zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in directions perpendicular and parallel to the leaf travel direction for the zzso (the combined external and zzso motion monitoring system in spite of a total system zzso of zzso s zzso zzso zzso accuracy for a highly modulated zzso zzso through zzso film zzso substantially when tracking was applied, but depended strongly on the respective geometric tracking zzso In conclusion, we have for the first time integrated zzso tracking with zzso imaging in the zzso geometry and demonstrated highly accurate respiratory motion zzso
