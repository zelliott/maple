zzso against tumor cell surface zzso have been used as selective carriers of zzso drugs, which themselves lack zzso Although such zzso have been demonstrated in tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso should provide larger yields of zzso zzso zzso for therapeutic zzso This review examined factors that influence the immune response to zzso transplantation zzso zzso and the methods for rendering tumor cells more zzso Consideration was also given to techniques for elimination of irrelevant zzso zzso These could involve zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso as well as tailoring of the zzso zzso Various toxic agents that have been linked to zzso zzso with retention of agent and zzso activity were zzso zzso drugs, zzso zzso cell surface agents, protein synthesis zzso and unconventional zzso agents that selectively convert nontoxic zzso or zzso into zzso zzso The methods by which effective zzso can be produced and their possible mode of action were described for the different types of zzso Several problems inherent in this zzso of tumor therapy include: 1) the necessity of binding zzso effective amounts of zzso agent, 2) ensuring of delivery of drug in active form to target sites, 3) avoidance of host reactions to foreign zzso and 4) possible emergence of resistant tumor cell zzso zzso zzso agents may find their greatest use in the zzso of small numbers of circulating tumor cells and zzso remaining after removal of primary zzso
