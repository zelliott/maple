zzso upon stimulation by a zzso adhere to a zzso and then in zzso fashion migrate toward the source of the zzso We have studied molecular events in both adherence and migration and have arrived at the following zzso 1) zzso like other zzso cells such as highly zzso tumor cells, can use zzso to attach to Type IV basement membrane zzso zzso may use this zzso mechanism in their zzso from the zzso 2) zzso cells may be zzso to migrate as a result of the zzso zzso of zzso a natural inhibitor of zzso zzso an zzso that may be essential for zzso 3) The zzso for this zzso is generated by both the zzso and zzso zzso These pathways may be regulated by another zzso zzso zzso 4) Natural zzso of zzso such as zzso inhibit zzso zzso again suggesting a regulatory role for zzso in zzso 5) zzso cells also produce zzso of zzso In addition to protecting the tumor from the zzso zzso these zzso may be related to normal zzso of cell zzso zzso determination of their mode of action could increase our understanding of this type of cell zzso
