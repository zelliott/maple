zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and generates zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso 4, zzso is a second zzso essential for the zzso of zzso to the plasma membrane where it is zzso and activated by zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso of zzso plays a pivotal role in fundamental cellular functions such as cell proliferation and survival by zzso a variety of zzso In recent years, it has been reported that zzso to the zzso signaling zzso are frequent in human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso occurs due to amplification of the zzso gene zzso zzso or the zzso zzso or as a result of zzso in components of the pathway, for example zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10), which inhibit the zzso of zzso Several small molecules designed to specifically target zzso have been developed, and induced cell cycle arrest or zzso in human cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso Moreover, the combination of an inhibitor with various zzso agents enhances the zzso zzso zzso specific zzso of the zzso of zzso may be a valid approach to treating human zzso and overcoming the resistance of cancer cells to radiation or zzso
