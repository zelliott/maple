A zzso model for avascular cancer growth including cell zzso zzso and death is zzso The model zzso reproduces commonly observed zzso for primary tumors, and the simulated patterns are characterized by its zzso zzso total number of cancer cells, and number of cells on tumor zzso These very distinct zzso patterns follow zzso growth curves, but exhibit different zzso laws for their zzso Also, the simulated tumors incorporate a spatial structure composed of a central zzso core, an inner rim of zzso cells and a narrow outer shell of zzso cells in agreement with biological zzso Finally, our results indicate that the competition for nutrients among normal and cancer cells may be a determining factor in generating zzso tumor zzso
