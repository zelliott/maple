zzso and zzso studies in human cancer cells and analysis of a transgenic mouse model have convincingly established that zzso performs a seminal role in regulating zzso invasion, zzso zzso and zzso the salient defining hallmarks of zzso These observations are strongly buttressed by zzso correlations of zzso expression in a diverse array of zzso distinguishing zzso as an independent zzso for highly aggressive zzso disease with poor zzso zzso has been shown to be a marker predicting response to chemotherapy, and serum zzso zzso zzso also serves as a predictor of advanced stages of aggressive zzso However, inconsistent findings have been reported regarding the zzso of zzso protein in the nucleus or zzso of cancer cells and the utility of nuclear or zzso zzso to predict the course and prognosis of zzso This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature to emphasize the common and conflicting findings relative to the clinical significance of zzso in zzso
