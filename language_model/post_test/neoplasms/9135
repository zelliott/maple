The first DNA mismatch repair gene was identified in zzso coli nearly fifty years zzso Since then, five decades of basic biomedical research on this important repair zzso have led to an extensive understanding of its molecular zzso The significance of this work was clearly highlighted in the early 1990's when zzso in the human zzso of the mismatch repair genes were identified as responsible for Lynch syndrome (also known as zzso zzso colon zzso the most common form of zzso zzso zzso Basic science research on mismatch repair in lower organisms directly led researchers to the discovery of this link between defective mismatch repair and cancer and continues to guide clinical decisions zzso The knowledge that disrupted mismatch repair function gives rise to the zzso form of zzso instability called zzso instability continues to be an important diagnostic tool for identifying Lynch syndrome patients as well as sporadic cancer patients who suffer from mismatch zzso zzso Today, clinicians are using the information about mismatch repair molecular mechanism to guide decisions about cancer therapy as well to devise new zzso In this review, we will examine what is known about the molecular function of the human mismatch repair zzso We will highlight how this information is being used in cancer diagnosis and zzso We will also discuss strategies being designed to target the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso with defective mismatch zzso
