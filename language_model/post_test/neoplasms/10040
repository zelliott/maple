The in zzso and in zzso effects of partially zzso human zzso zzso zzso on natural killing zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso of peripheral blood were tested in 17 cancer zzso The study tested single doses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso incremental doses (15 over 5 zzso part zzso The initial response to zzso was a decline of zzso and zzso activity, reaching a zzso at 12 zzso The decline was found to be partly related to zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity generally returned to or exceeded baseline within zzso h and stayed elevated for a week or more after a single zzso Interestingly, the decline in zzso activity was not unique to the first injection, but was found even in chronic treatment 12 h after zzso zzso zzso studies showed that maximum stimulation was achieved by the end of the first week, when it was greater for patients receiving higher doses of zzso However, patients who received repeated injections at lower doses were able to sustain this zzso whereas those who received higher doses were zzso Very low doses zzso zzso appeared to be zzso zzso zzso administration to the same group of cancer patients seemed to have similar effects on zzso against tumor zzso Furthermore, our study has shown that cells responsive in zzso to zzso zzso prior to zzso showed an increase in zzso activity similar to that after in zzso administration of zzso indicating a simple predictor of patients' responsiveness to zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that in zzso administration of zzso results in a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso activity in cancer zzso
