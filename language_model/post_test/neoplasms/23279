The extent to which adult zzso a zzso of the interplay of genetic endowment and zzso experiences, is related to risk of chronic diseases in adulthood is zzso 

We calculated hazard ratios zzso for zzso assessed in increments of zzso zzso using zzso data on zzso deaths or major zzso vascular outcomes recorded among zzso people in 121 prospective zzso 

For people born between zzso and 1960, mean adult height increased zzso zzso with each successive decade of zzso After adjustment for age, sex, smoking and year of birth, zzso per zzso zzso greater height were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for death from any cause, zzso zzso for death from vascular causes, zzso zzso for death from cancer and zzso zzso for death from other zzso Height was zzso associated with death from coronary disease, stroke zzso heart failure, stomach and oral zzso chronic zzso pulmonary disease, mental disorders, liver disease and external zzso In contrast, height was positively associated with death from zzso zzso aneurysm, pulmonary zzso melanoma and zzso of the zzso zzso and nervous systems, zzso breast, zzso zzso blood and zzso zzso per zzso zzso greater height ranged from zzso zzso for risk of melanoma death to zzso zzso for risk of death from chronic zzso pulmonary zzso zzso were not appreciably altered after further adjustment for zzso blood pressure, zzso inflammation zzso diabetes zzso alcohol consumption or zzso zzso 

Adult height has zzso opposing relationships with risk of death from several different major causes of chronic zzso
