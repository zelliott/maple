zzso can be defined as all the zzso and zzso inherited changes in gene expression that are not zzso in the DNA sequence zzso zzso modifications of zzso and DNA have been recognized as important zzso and zzso factors in controlling the expressed zzso via gene zzso Two major zzso mechanisms are the zzso modification of zzso proteins in zzso and the zzso of DNA itself, which are regulated by zzso but zzso zzso It is clear that the zzso state is a central regulator of cellular development and zzso Emerging evidence suggests a key role for zzso in human zzso including in inflammatory and zzso zzso The zzso is influenced by environmental factors throughout zzso zzso factors can have profound effects on the expression of specific genes by zzso zzso and these may be passed on to subsequent generations with potentially zzso zzso Many zzso are associated with altered zzso profiles, leading to altered expression of the genes involved in cell growth or zzso zzso and zzso diseases increase in frequency with increasing age, with zzso zzso proposed as a potential zzso In support of this hypothesis, studies in zzso twins revealed increasing zzso differences with zzso zzso in zzso status of zzso sites, zzso zzso and other zzso regulatory mechanisms have been observed in key inflammatory response zzso The importance of the zzso in the zzso of common human diseases is likely to be as significant as that of traditional genetic zzso With advances in technology, our understanding of this area of biology is likely to increase rapidly in the near zzso
