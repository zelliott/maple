zzso progress and the evolution of biological knowledge lead us to expect major developments in the fields of organ replacement, minimally invasive surgery and zzso therapy in the coming zzso It is widely believed that zzso may offer a possible solution to the problem of the current chronic shortage of donors, though their use at present encounters formidable zzso obstacles, particularly as regards zzso zzso zzso engineering and the zzso of transgenic donors as well as new strategies aimed at zzso the immune status of the donor may well be the key to new developments in this zzso Selective zzso of zzso and the production of totally zzso artificial zzso are additional lines of research which may provide useful means of meeting the increasing demand for zzso The enormous advances made in the field of high-tech solutions applied to the biomedical disciplines are destined to open up new frontiers in zzso operating technique and the permanent training of zzso In particular, we are about to witness an extension of the use of computer technology and zzso embracing the simulation and reproduction of virtual reality, zzso zzso and zzso and the creation of experimental zzso zzso invasive surgery will zzso benefit from this progress with the possibility of extending its range of indications to procedures in which human limitations are more evident zzso to difficulties of access and the size of the target, at the same time guaranteeing zzso zzso In the zzso field, high expectations accompany the advances in our knowledge of molecular biology with the genetic mapping of zzso which may pave the way for screening programs and gene zzso zzso the scientific and technological development of the surgery of the future, we can expect to see the increasing emergence of: a) economic problems related to the progressive increase in zzso costs, amongst other things as a result of the powerful impact of high-tech zzso b) social problems in terms of the inevitable conflict between zzso policies and the right to zzso c) moral and zzso problems relating to the possible establishment of genetic zzso and to the different zzso provider relationship which is likely to come about as the result of the interference of machines or zzso The zzso persona may undergo profound changes, not merely from the technical and professional training standpoint, but also with regard to his or her effective role, which may no longer be that of a central, dominant figure, but may be scaled down in a context of multidisciplinary zzso
