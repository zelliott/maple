The American Cancer Society has challenged the zzso to reduce cancer mortality rates 50% over the 25 years from 1990 to zzso The current report is an analysis and commentary on progress toward that goal through 2002, the zzso of the challenge zzso 

Cancer mortality rates were examined from 1990 through 2002, and projections to the Year zzso were zzso Cancer deaths that were prevented or deferred by the declining death rates were expressed as the difference between the observed and projected numbers of deaths and the numbers that would have been observed over that period had the 1990 death rates zzso 

Since 1990, cancer mortality rates have been declining in the zzso by approximately zzso per zzso Trends especially have been favorable for zzso of the breast, zzso and zzso and for lung cancer among zzso Should this rate of decline continue over the coming decade, death rates from cancer will be approximately zzso lower in the Year zzso than they were in 1990, and approximately zzso million deaths from cancer will have been prevented or zzso 

At this zzso of the zzso challenge period, it appears that fully reaching the goal will require substantial breakthroughs in cancer early detection and/or in cancer zzso Between now and 2015, however, many more cancer deaths can be averted by concerted action to control tobacco and zzso by zzso efforts in zzso and zzso zzso and by enacting policies to close gaps in access to cancer detection and treatment zzso
