We propose a simple zzso model based on the two successive zzso hypothesis to zzso cancer zzso Assume that only stem cells are susceptible to the first zzso and that there are a total of D stem cell divisions over the lifetime of the tissue with a first zzso probability zzso per zzso Our model predicts that cancer risk will be low if m zzso zzso is low even in the case of very advantageous zzso Moreover, if zzso is low the zzso probability of the second zzso is practically irrelevant to the cancer zzso These results are in contrast with existing models but in agreement with a conjecture of zzso In the case where m is large our model predicts that the cancer risk depends zzso on whether the first zzso is advantageous or zzso A zzso or neutral zzso makes the risk of cancer drop zzso
