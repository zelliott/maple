We developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso complex for use in zzso zzso and as a zzso zzso To produce zzso we reacted zzso with 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The temperature rise of zzso was measured in zzso and in zzso under a portable zzso zzso zzso Platinum zzso from zzso over 24 hours was measured in bovine zzso In in zzso zzso and magnet and zzso experiments we used four rat zzso In group 1 we delivered zzso zzso zzso and placed magnets zzso zzso In group 2 we injected saline zzso and placed magnets zzso In group 3 we injected zzso zzso and placed a zzso incision zzso The control zzso 4) received an zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso muscle tissue was stained with zzso and zzso tissue areas zzso were zzso The maximum platinum concentration in zzso was approximately zzso zzso Over 24 hours, zzso of platinum from zzso was zzso There was a significant difference zzso zzso zzso in the zzso area between group 1 and the other zzso The temperature in muscle tissue registered a maximum of zzso after about 4 zzso zzso may represent a zzso zzso drug with zzso zzso
