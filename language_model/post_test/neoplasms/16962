zzso occurring in a zzso patient remains a common life-threatening complication of cancer zzso The common practice is to admit the patient to hospital and treat him or her zzso with intravenous zzso zzso zzso therapy could be an alternative approach for selected zzso 

To compare the efficacy of oral antibiotics versus intravenous zzso zzso therapy in zzso zzso cancer zzso 

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso zzso 1) in The Cochrane Library, zzso zzso to January week 4, zzso zzso zzso to 2013 week 4) and zzso zzso to zzso We searched several databases for ongoing zzso We checked the conference proceedings of the zzso Conference of zzso Agents and zzso zzso zzso to 2007), and all references of included studies and major reviews were zzso 

zzso controlled trials zzso comparing oral zzso to intravenous zzso for the treatment of zzso cancer patients with zzso The comparison between the two could be started initially zzso zzso or following an initial course of intravenous zzso treatment zzso 

Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and zzso quality and extracted zzso Data concerning zzso treatment failures and adverse events were extracted from the included studies assuming an zzso basis for the outcome measures whenever zzso zzso ratios zzso with zzso confidence intervals zzso were estimated for zzso zzso zzso of bias assessment was also made in line with methodology of The Cochrane zzso 

Twenty-two trials zzso episodes in zzso zzso were included in the zzso The mortality rate was similar when comparing oral to intravenous zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 9 trials, zzso patients, median mortality 0, range zzso to zzso Treatment failure rates were also similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso all zzso No significant zzso was shown for all comparisons but adverse zzso The effect was stable in a wide range of zzso zzso alone or combined with another zzso were used with comparable zzso zzso zzso mostly zzso were more common with oral zzso 

Based on the present data, oral treatment is an acceptable alternative to intravenous zzso treatment in zzso zzso cancer patients zzso patients with acute zzso who are zzso stable, without organ failure, and do not have pneumonia, infection of a central line or a severe zzso zzso The wide zzso for mortality allows the present use of oral treatment in groups of patients with an expected low risk for zzso and further research should be aimed at clarifying the definition of low risk zzso
