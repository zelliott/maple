A population of approximately 650 beluga zzso zzso inhabits a short segment of the zzso Lawrence zzso zzso Over 17 years zzso we have examined 129 (or zzso of 263 zzso beluga carcasses reported zzso The major primary causes of death were respiratory and gastrointestinal infections with zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso and zzso infections zzso We observed cancer in zzso of examined adult animals found dead, a percentage similar to that found in zzso The estimated annual rate zzso of all cancer types zzso zzso is much higher than that reported for any other population of zzso and is similar to that of humans and to that of hospitalized cats and zzso The zzso of cancer of the zzso zzso a minimum figure of 63 per 100,000 animals, is much higher than that observed in domestic animals and humans, except in sheep in certain parts of the world, where environmental zzso are believed to be involved in the zzso of this zzso zzso beluga and their environment are contaminated by zzso aromatic zzso zzso produced by the local aluminum zzso The human population living in proximity of the zzso beluga habitat is affected by rates of cancer higher than those found in people in the rest of zzso and Canada, and some of these zzso have been zzso related to zzso zzso with the above zzso the exposure of zzso beluga to zzso and their contamination by these compounds are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso are involved in the zzso of cancer in these zzso
