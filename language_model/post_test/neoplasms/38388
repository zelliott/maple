The recent large zzso studies have identified a new repertoire of cancer zzso genes and zzso which are characterized by common risk zzso and low relative zzso Because of these properties, these zzso explain a much larger proportion of the zzso of the particular zzso described by the population attributable fraction zzso than of their familial risks zzso For breast cancer, the 9 established zzso gave a joint zzso of zzso but explaining only some zzso of the empirical zzso For prostate cancer, 6 independent zzso at zzso zzso zzso a joint zzso of zzso but the zzso explained no more than zzso of the empirical excess familial zzso For zzso cancer, the contributions of the 2 identified zzso to zzso and zzso were somewhat zzso The zzso array platforms have been built for common zzso constraining the results to zzso with high zzso and low zzso However, the common zzso are likely to tag rarer zzso zzso with much higher zzso The detected zzso are zzso and the underlying genetic mechanisms have not been worked zzso The data suggest, in spite of the reservations for combining data on zzso across zzso that the published first-generation zzso scans on breast, prostate and zzso zzso have made successful inroads into zzso of common zzso yet leaving the mechanisms to be zzso
