zzso of human cancer risk from the results of zzso zzso requires two types of zzso a qualitative zzso from short-lived zzso species to zzso humans, and a quantitative zzso from zzso doses in the zzso to low-level human zzso Experimental evidence on the accuracy of prediction between closely related species tested under similar experimental conditions zzso mice, and zzso indicates that: zzso if a chemical is positive in one species, it will be positive in the second species about zzso of the time; however, since about 50% of test chemicals are positive in each species, by chance alone one would expect a zzso value between species of about zzso zzso If a chemical zzso tumors in a particular target organ in one species, it will induce tumors in the same organ in the second species about 50% of the zzso Similar zzso values are obtained in an analysis of prediction from humans to rats or from humans to mice for known human zzso zzso of zzso data for use in quantitative zzso are discussed, including constraints on both estimates of zzso potency and of the zzso in experiments with only two doses and a zzso zzso zzso should be based on an understanding of mechanisms of zzso particularly zzso effects that are present at high and not low zzso
