zzso are zzso receptors that play a critical role in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among them, zzso zzso that recognizes the zzso zzso zzso is reported to be involved in zzso tissue repair and tumor zzso We have recently zzso a new and selective zzso of zzso zzso referred to as zzso that contains a zzso zzso motif and two zzso zzso 

The aim of this study is to evaluate in zzso and in zzso the effects of zzso zzso we assessed its properties in cellular zzso cells zzso and vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and animal models zzso zzso rats and zzso zzso of zzso 

In zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling and cell zzso Furthermore, zzso blocks the ability of zzso to form tubes on zzso In zzso wound healing is delayed in presence of zzso Similarly, zzso plugs demonstrate an zzso effect of zzso 

Our data indicate the importance of zzso in the selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Such zzso opens new fields of investigation on the mechanisms of zzso offering clinical implications for treatment of zzso conditions such as cancer, zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso
