With approximately 50% of all cancer patients receiving radiation therapy at some point in their treatment, increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells to the lethal effects of zzso has the potential to significantly improve the rate of recovery from many zzso The major biological zzso of zzso failure is tumor zzso It is well known that tumors from the same zzso group and stage of development are extremely zzso in their sensitivity to zzso There are many factors which could affect tumor zzso One cellular mechanism common to various therapeutic zzso including radiation, is killing tumor cells via zzso However, this killing is not always zzso In this review the link between tumor sensitivity to radiation treatment and the capacity of tumor cells to be killed by zzso mechanisms will be zzso
