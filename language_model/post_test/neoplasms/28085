In in zzso studies, zzso and zzso effects were reported for the combination of zzso and zzso Recently, an oral zzso of zzso became zzso This phase I study was performed to assess the feasibility of the combination of oral zzso and zzso the zzso interaction, and zzso zzso 

zzso was administered orally zzso daily for 5 days in escalating doses and zzso was given zzso zzso at a fixed dose of 75 zzso either before zzso administration on day 1 zzso zzso or after zzso administration on day 5 zzso zzso once every 3 zzso Patients were treated in a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients were entered onto the study; one patient was not zzso zzso CT induced significantly more severe zzso than did sequence zzso and the zzso dosage of zzso in sequence CT was zzso zzso zzso zzso In sequence zzso the zzso dosage of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxicity consisted of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were linear over the dose range zzso no zzso effects were zzso In addition, zzso did not influence the protein binding of zzso or the zzso zzso formation in peripheral zzso in either zzso 

The recommended zzso for phase II studies involving patients like the patients in our study are zzso zzso zzso PO zzso 5 preceded by zzso 75 zzso IV day 1 once every 3 weeks, and zzso zzso zzso PO followed by zzso 75 zzso IV day zzso No zzso interaction could be discerned in our zzso The zzso efficacy of both schedules should be evaluated in a zzso phase II zzso
