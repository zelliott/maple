In spite of our expanding knowledge on the molecular biology of cancer, relatively little progress has been made in improving therapy for the solid zzso which are major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso advances over the past zzso years in chemotherapy of some zzso such as zzso cancer and some zzso indicates that, in spite of the zzso zzso chemotherapy has the potential to effect cure in the majority of patients with certain types of zzso zzso resistance, inherent or acquired, is one important limiting factor in extending this success to most solid zzso In zzso studies described in this review are now uncovering a diversity of possible mechanisms of zzso to different types of zzso Sensitive methods such as zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso may be necessary to identify corresponding changes in clinical zzso Only by zzso individual zzso according to their specific resistance mechanisms will it be possible to define the zzso resistance problem zzso Such rigorous definition is a prerequisite to design (and choice on an individual zzso of specific therapies suited to individual zzso Since a much larger proportion of cancer zzso should be susceptible to accurate analysis by the zzso and molecular biological techniques described above than to direct assessment of drug response, it seems reasonable to hope that this approach will succeed in improving results for cancer chemotherapy of solid zzso where other approaches such as zzso in zzso zzso testing have essentially zzso zzso from clinical trials using zzso A or zzso are encouraging, but these agents are far from ideal, and reverse resistance in only a subset of resistant zzso Proper definition of the other mechanisms of zzso and how to antagonize them, is an urgent research zzso
