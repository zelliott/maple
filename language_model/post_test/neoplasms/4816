The relationship between zzso and zzso serum zzso and clinical effects has not previously been investigated in cancer pain zzso 

The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a relationship between zzso zzso and pain intensity, cognitive zzso zzso or zzso in cancer zzso Also, zzso and zzso contributions to analgesia and the adverse effects of zzso were zzso 

Four hundred zzso cancer patients receiving zzso for cancer pain were zzso zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso The European zzso for Research and Treatment of Cancer zzso zzso was used to assess the symptoms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso function was assessed using the zzso State zzso zzso were examined by multiple linear or zzso zzso zzso Whether patients classified as being a zzso zzso or a zzso zzso had different serum zzso of zzso or zzso was assessed using zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were not associated with pain intensity, zzso zzso or cognitive function, with the exception that increased pain intensity was associated with higher zzso zzso Patients with poor pain control and side effects had higher serum zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared with those with good pain relief and without side zzso 

This study of patients receiving zzso for cancer pain confirms previous observations that there is most likely no association between serum zzso of zzso analgesics and clinical zzso
