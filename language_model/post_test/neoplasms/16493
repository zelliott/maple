An zzso study conducted by zzso et zzso reported that residential wire codes were more strongly associated with childhood cancer than were measured magnetic fields, a peculiar result because wire codes were originally developed to be a surrogate for residential magnetic zzso The primary purpose of the study reported here, known as the Back to Denver zzso study, was to obtain data to help in the interpretation of the original results of zzso et zzso The zzso study included 81 homes that had been occupied by case and control subjects of zzso et zzso zzso by wire code as zzso 18 high current zzso zzso case homes; 20 zzso control homes; 20 low current zzso zzso case homes; and 23 zzso control zzso Analysis of new data acquired in these homes led to the following previously unpublished zzso The zzso zzso mean of fields measured in subjects' bedrooms, zzso rooms, and rooms where meals normally zzso spot 60 zzso 180 zzso and harmonic zzso zzso zzso magnetic fields were associated with wire zzso The 180 zzso and harmonic zzso but not the 60 zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso Measured zzso magnetic fields were only zzso correlated zzso zzso between rooms in zzso The zzso data provide little support for, but are too sparse to definitively test, the 1995 resonance hypothesis proposed by Bowman et zzso Case and control homes had similar zzso of copper in their tap zzso zzso concentration was not associated with wire codes nor with the level of electric current carried by a home's water zzso These results of the zzso study suggest that future zzso studies investigating power frequency magnetic fields might wish to include zzso of 180 zzso or harmonic magnetic fields in order to examine their associations (if zzso with disease zzso
