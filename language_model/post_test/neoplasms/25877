zzso is a zzso that adds zzso zzso repeats onto the 3' ends of zzso High zzso activity has been associated with zzso cells, transformed cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is not clear what zzso would be observed by transient zzso of zzso Studies were designed to inhibit zzso activity using a series of zzso zzso sequence zzso The studies evaluated the zzso hydrogen zzso and sequence requirements of zzso zzso using the zzso zzso and a zzso measuring cell viability following exposure to the zzso In addition, we have also studied the role of the 3' end and secondary structure of zzso mimics on zzso zzso Observations reveal that sensitivity to the zzso may not require zzso to an zzso target but required zzso zzso on the 3' end for cells in culture and zzso zzso in zzso The importance of H bonding and the requirement for a free 3' end for the activity of these compounds has also been zzso However, transient zzso of zzso is not zzso to all zzso cells and is not sufficient to explain the mechanism of zzso of these short zzso
