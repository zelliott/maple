The zzso zzso cell line zzso is well zzso and used widely, while the human zzso cell strain, zzso zzso zzso requires validation for use in human zzso zzso is currently estimated to account for up to 41 % of the worldwide cancer zzso A human in zzso model system is required to zzso the molecular mechanisms for this poorly understood zzso This work investigates the relevance of the zzso cell strain for obesity and cancer research in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were differentiated according to standard zzso zzso was assessed by Oil Red O zzso zzso gene expression was measured by zzso and zzso function was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso cell line zzso following zzso with zzso or primary zzso human zzso was investigated using Human Cancer zzso zzso zzso 

During the process of zzso zzso expressed higher levels of zzso transcripts and fully differentiated zzso expressed more similar zzso transcript levels and zzso function to primary zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso with zzso or primary zzso zzso induced differential expression of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and invasion and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene zzso zzso function and a shared induced gene signature in zzso zzso cells indicate that zzso is a relevant in zzso model for obesity and cancer research in zzso
