We present a zzso zzso combining gold zzso zzso and zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso The gold zzso exhibit zzso resonance zzso at near infrared zzso to enable zzso imaging and zzso therapy, while the zzso zzso enable zzso control of the zzso The zzso zzso can be directed and concentrated by an external magnetic field, which provides enhancement of a zzso zzso Application of an external field also leads to enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso by cancer cells in zzso Under laser zzso at the wavelength of the zzso zzso peak, the zzso zzso efficiently generates zzso zzso within cancer cells, as zzso by zzso zzso causing cell zzso The combined magnetic and zzso zzso of the zzso enable magnetic zzso zzso enhanced zzso cancer zzso 

In this study, a zzso of gold zzso and iron oxide zzso is presented using a zzso zzso delivery system for magnetic zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso The gold zzso enable zzso imaging and zzso therapy, while the zzso zzso enable zzso control of the zzso This and similar systems could enable more precise and efficient cancer therapy, hopefully in the near future, after additional zzso
