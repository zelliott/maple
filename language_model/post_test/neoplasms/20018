Under certain conditions, repetitive DNA motifs have the potential to adopt zzso DNA structures, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Some zzso zzso have been proposed to cause zzso and, consequently, participate in several biologically important zzso including regulation, evolution, and human zzso Advancement in the knowledge of specific interactions between molecules and zzso zzso at the molecular level in living cells is important for understanding their biological zzso In this review, we describe the latest studies on molecules that target zzso zzso in zzso with a focus on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
