In combined zzso imaging, functional data provided by zzso increase diagnostic accuracy over conventional PET and CT in a variety of zzso The question to be raised is: how much is CT needed in zzso zzso 

In zzso CT imaging, contrast agents are applied to aid differentiation of zzso structures, improve zzso zzso and support zzso zzso Based on our experience, the most important benefit when applying CT contrast agents in zzso imaging relates to more precise zzso zzso of pathology by differentiation of the zzso from its surrounding structures on zzso This benefit must be considered most profound in the head and neck as well as the abdomen and zzso where zzso of pathology from muscles, vascular structures, or the zzso is zzso CT contrast agents can be of additional value in tumors with only mild or no increase in zzso zzso by supporting zzso detection and zzso The complementary role of CT contrast agents and molecular contrast for zzso imaging is addressed in this zzso The authors provide specific indications as to which zzso CT data provide additional diagnostic zzso 

zzso contrast aids zzso detection and zzso whereas zzso contrast improves zzso zzso CT contrast agents and PET zzso do not compete but rather are complementary in combined zzso zzso
