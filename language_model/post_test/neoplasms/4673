Recent progress in zzso adult zzso cell research has inspired great interest because these immature cells from your own body can act as potential, easily accessible cell sources for cell transplantation in zzso medicine and cancer zzso The use of adult zzso cells endowed with a high zzso ability and zzso differentiation potential, which are able to zzso all the mature cells in the zzso from their origin, offers great promise in replacing zzso or lost cells and zzso diseased and damaged zzso The presence of a small zzso of adult zzso cells in most zzso and zzso provides the possibility of stimulating their in zzso zzso or of using their ex zzso expanded zzso for zzso and gene therapies with multiple applications in humans without a high-risk of graft rejection and major side zzso Among the diseases that could be treated by adult stem zzso therapies are zzso and immune disorders, multiple degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, zzso 1 and 2 diabetes zzso as well as skin, eye, liver, zzso tooth and cardiovascular zzso In addition, a combination of the current cancer treatments with an zzso treatment consisting of an zzso or zzso adult zzso cell transplantation also represents a promising strategy for treating and even curing diverse aggressive, zzso zzso and lethal zzso In this chapter, we reviewed the most recent zzso on the characterization of zzso and functional properties of adult zzso cell types found in bone zzso heart, brain and other zzso and discussed their therapeutic implications in the stem zzso transplantation zzso
