Several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso B have been implicated in zzso progression of zzso Many investigators have demonstrated correlations between increased activity of zzso B and increased zzso capability of animal tumors or zzso of human zzso Such increases in zzso B activity in zzso tumors may reflect zzso in zzso in zzso and processing, and/or in zzso trafficking and delivery as well as in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso transcripts for zzso B have been observed in both zzso and human tumors and multiple transcripts for zzso B have been identified, but an association of multiple transcripts with zzso has not been zzso zzso B precursors found in human zzso zzso fluid do not possess zzso carbohydrates suggesting that a zzso in the post zzso processing of zzso zzso on tumor zzso B may be responsible for the release of zzso B observed in many tumor zzso However, the zzso trafficking of zzso B responsible for its association with plasma zzso systems and for its release will require further study as both zzso precursor forms of zzso B and native forms of zzso B are zzso We speculate that zzso tumor cells adherent to basement membrane are capable of forming a zzso zzso in which zzso zzso such as zzso B function zzso a zzso similar to that formed between adherent zzso and zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, also is affected by zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso of zzso A is found as well as a reduction in its zzso capacity against zzso zzso The data to date at both the molecular and protein levels supporting a functional zzso for zzso B and its zzso zzso in cancer progression are only zzso Experimental approaches utilizing zzso model systems in conjunction with genetic manipulation of zzso B and its zzso zzso are needed to provide convincing evidence that zzso B has an important role in zzso
