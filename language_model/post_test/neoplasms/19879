By enabling the simultaneous engagement of two distinct targets, zzso zzso broaden the potential utility of zzso zzso However, zzso design and production remain challenging, zzso to the need to incorporate two distinct heavy and light chain pairs while maintaining natural zzso zzso zzso Here we present a zzso production strategy that relies on zzso of two bacterial zzso each expressing a zzso Using this approach, we produce 28 unique zzso zzso A zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binds both targets zzso zzso their zzso and suppresses zzso and zzso cell and tumor zzso Our strategy allows rapid generation of zzso zzso from any two existing zzso and yields zzso to gram quantities of zzso zzso sufficient for a wide range of discovery and zzso zzso
