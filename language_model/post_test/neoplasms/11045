zzso restriction zzso has multiple beneficial effects, the two most prominently studied being an increased longevity and an increased cancer zzso zzso zzso is a protein zzso that has been linked to zzso To explore the relation between zzso and zzso we have examined here zzso cancer protection in mice zzso zzso zzso zzso under its own regulatory elements zzso zzso In particular, we have subjected zzso mice, carrying or not the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso which is a type of DR that significantly delays cancer zzso As expected, zzso extended the survival of zzso zzso zzso ) zzso However, the extension of survival of zzso mice by zzso was the same in the presence or absence of the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has a limited role in zzso cancer protection by DR in zzso
