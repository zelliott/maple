We present here the results of a zzso study on light scattering from zzso particles with relevance to detecting zzso states in zzso zzso In previous studies of zzso cell zzso the experimental light scattering data have been analyzed by comparison with zzso zzso However, given the zzso shape of many cell zzso the zzso of this assumption demands a thorough zzso We investigate this assumption by using the zzso method to model light scattered from zzso with parameters relevant to zzso cell zzso In our previous studies, we have developed a data analysis procedure that extracts the zzso component of the zzso distribution for an ensemble of zzso cell zzso for comparison with zzso zzso We demonstrate that application of our analysis procedure to the predictions of the zzso method for zzso oriented such that their axis of symmetry is aligned with the incident light propagation direction, generally yields the zzso dimension that is zzso to the incident light propagation direction with zzso zzso
