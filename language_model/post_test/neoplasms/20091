The zzso transition zzso is a biological phenomenon responsible for the formation of different zzso and zzso during normal zzso zzso Because of the connection of the zzso with the zzso of certain diseases, such as cancer, the attention of the scientific community has been directed towards the search for and identification of effective therapeutic zzso These targets include signal zzso in zzso stem cells and the use of zzso which would inhibit zzso zzso changes and zzso zzso In an attempt to compile relevant and current information, this work addresses concepts that define the zzso and the advances in this zzso The wealth of knowledge gained from areas such as the loss of cell polarity and zzso zzso complexes, the signaling pathways zzso zzso participation in this process, and zzso acquisition in embryonic and zzso cells, all of which allow for the zzso of promising perspectives, particularly, methods for targeting advanced zzso are presented zzso
