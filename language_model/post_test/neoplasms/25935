To define a maximum tolerated dose zzso for the combination of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in patients with advanced solid tumors and zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in stages I and zzso zzso patients were treated in stage I in sequential zzso of at least three patients at increasing dosage levels of zzso and zzso for up to six cycles every 21 zzso At the completion of stage I, a zzso for zzso was zzso Fourteen patients were treated in stage II, in zzso of three or zzso The zzso dose remained constant at the zzso dosage from stage zzso zzso was further zzso to establish its zzso zzso patients with previously zzso zzso zzso were treated in stage III with the zzso established in the prior zzso 

The zzso in stage I was zzso 150 zzso and zzso 1500 zzso with cumulative zzso as the zzso toxicity zzso zzso zzso prevented further zzso of zzso in stage zzso The stage III regimen consisted of six, zzso cycles of zzso 150 zzso zzso 1500 zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso 100 zzso for five days with zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients zzso completed six cycles of treatment, eight zzso without dose zzso Common toxicity criteria zzso grade 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was documented in 85 of 118 cycles zzso zzso fever was documented in 17 of 21 patients zzso on at least one zzso Severe zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso was seen in zzso of 118 cycles zzso and increased with cycle zzso There was no significant zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was possible with zzso zzso The zzso achieved was approximately double that of zzso zzso This study forms the basis of an ongoing zzso study evaluating zzso in intermediate grade zzso
