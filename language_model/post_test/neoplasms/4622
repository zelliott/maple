Cellular signal zzso in response to environmental signals involves a relay of precisely regulated signal amplifying and zzso zzso A zzso signaling relay involves zzso binding to cell surface receptors and triggering the zzso of downstream zzso to ultimately affect the zzso distribution and activity of zzso proteins that regulate gene zzso These so-called signal zzso zzso have dominated our view of signaling for zzso More recently evidence has accumulated that components of these zzso can be multifunctional, in effect playing a conventional role for example as a cell surface zzso for a zzso whilst also having alternative functions for example as zzso regulators in the zzso This raises new challenges for zzso What are the zzso that determine which role such proteins zzso What are the trafficking pathways which regulate the spatial distribution of such proteins so that they can perform nuclear functions and under what circumstances are these alternative functions most zzso
