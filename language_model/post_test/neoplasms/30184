To zzso the life years gained and financial savings by preventing a case of occupational zzso 

The authors retrieved data from the Taiwan Cancer zzso and linked them with the National zzso zzso to estimate the survival functions for major occupational zzso zzso zzso zzso urinary zzso and zzso Assuming a constant excess hazard for each type of cancer, the authors zzso lifetime survival functions by the zzso Carlo zzso For each patient with cancer, the authors simulated an zzso and zzso person without cancer based on vital statistics of Taiwan to estimate life expectancy and expected years of life lost zzso By using the reimbursement data from the National Health Insurance Research zzso the authors calculated the average monthly zzso zzso which were summed to estimate the lifetime zzso expenditures after adjusting for the corresponding monthly survival zzso 

A total of zzso zzso zzso and zzso new cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were identified during zzso and followed until the end of zzso The zzso was predicted to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso years for these zzso respectively, and the lifetime zzso expenditures with a zzso annual discount were predicted to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The burden of these occupational zzso in terms of zzso and lifetime zzso zzso was zzso Such estimates may provide useful empirical evidence for comparative risk assessment that can be applied in health policy-making and clinical zzso
