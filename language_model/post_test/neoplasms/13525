Since its discovery, the zzso locus has been considered as an important site for the understanding of cell cycle zzso that are involved in cancer cell zzso A comprehensive approach of the respective roles played by the two zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso by this locus was not yet achieved because of the structural zzso of their zzso zzso of the only zzso gene in mouse allowed to get better insight into this zzso In zzso results presented by de zzso group showed that zzso of both zzso zzso generated a panel of various types of tumors from the 28th week following zzso zzso group zzso not confirm this result but showed that the presence of only one zzso functional copy increases sensitivity of zzso mice to tumor occurrence indicating that insufficient dosage of zzso protein may facilitate zzso It seems now established that, at least in zzso zzso controls zzso in zzso zzso and transformation by zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be crucial for the induction of zzso zzso
