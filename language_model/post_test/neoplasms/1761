The aim of this study was to zzso compare the value of integrated zzso and separate PET plus zzso imaging studies for zzso zzso in cancer zzso Two different series of consecutive patients who had previously been treated for zzso disease were zzso One series consisted of 105 patients who had undergone zzso zzso zzso ( zzso or zzso zzso ( zzso studies zzso zzso The other series comprised 105 patients who had undergone zzso PET scan ( zzso or zzso PET scan ( zzso alone; in this series, PET findings were correlated with the results of zzso imaging zzso studies, zzso CT ( zzso or MR imaging ( zzso zzso zzso zzso of abnormal zzso zzso at PET scanning were classified as ambiguous or zzso depending on their precise anatomical zzso A total of zzso and 196 zzso were found in the zzso and zzso groups, zzso The difference in terms of number of zzso per patient detected with the two imaging protocols was not statistically significant ( zzso When analysis of zzso zzso was performed, there were zzso zzso and zzso zzso ambiguous zzso in the zzso and zzso groups, zzso The number of ambiguous zzso was significantly higher in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso of the effect of use of the different zzso on reporting of zzso versus zzso revealed that the improvement in the final report in zzso zzso studies was similar to that observed in zzso zzso In cancer patients, zzso shows higher diagnostic accuracy for zzso zzso than PET plus zzso imaging studies performed zzso This result does not seem to be affected by the type of zzso zzso
