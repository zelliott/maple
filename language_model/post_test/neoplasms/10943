zzso carry a better prognosis than men for many cancer zzso We hypothesized that zzso changes, in particular zzso zzso of the sex zzso or the presence of zzso may contribute to these gender zzso 

To characterize the influence of gender a literature search was performed for survival data of 27 tumor zzso All entities were zzso by the strength of evidence for differences in survival between females and zzso To test our hypothesis the zzso database of zzso zzso was evaluated for the major tumor types occurring in both women and zzso zzso zzso zzso were documented and mean zzso numbers were converted into zzso to provide insight into the zzso level of 37 cancer zzso 

In general, a survival advantage of women could be shown for most, but not all cancer zzso In addition, zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso were more frequent in males than females indicating a potential link with gender differences in zzso zzso was a common phenomenon in many cancer types suggesting that it represents a zzso condition of the cancer zzso It was not related to gender differences in zzso However, the extent of zzso and zzso was associated with poor prognosis in zzso There was no single case in the zzso database with normal zzso number zzso zzso zzso that did not carry at least one structural or zzso zzso 

Our study highlights the importance of zzso changes in tumor formation and zzso In addition, it suggests potential associations with gender specific differences in zzso
