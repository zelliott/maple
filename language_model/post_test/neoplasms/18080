The rate of zzso recovery after peripheral blood zzso cell zzso transplantation is influenced by the dose of zzso zzso zzso of cells that express zzso on their surface is the most frequently used method to determine zzso cell zzso In zzso growth of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso requires more time and resources, but may add zzso zzso 

A series of 323 patients, who underwent zzso zzso transplantation for multiple zzso zzso lymphoma, or locally advanced breast cancer, were studied for the effect of zzso dose and zzso dose on zzso zzso zzso for zzso were days to absolute zzso and zzso zzso counts to greater than 500 per zzso and than 20 zzso zzso per zzso respectively, and number of zzso zzso and red cell units zzso 

The zzso dose had a median of zzso zzso zzso per zzso and the zzso dose a median of zzso zzso zzso per zzso The zzso and zzso doses showed significant correlation (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso but a wide variation in the ratio of zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso doses had significant correlation with the measures of zzso but for all measures the relationship of zzso was zzso zzso analysis and zzso analysis of patients receiving zzso doses of less than 5 zzso zzso per zzso also did not reveal an independent zzso value for zzso 

For prediction of zzso recovery after zzso zzso zzso determination of zzso dose does not add to the zzso value of the zzso zzso
