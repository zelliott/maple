The immune system of the human zzso comprises the innate system cells and the zzso immune zzso The former include the zzso cells, mast cells, zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso and the latter include zzso T cells, zzso T cells, T regulatory cells zzso and B zzso The innate system zzso are the major zzso cells to zzso zzso T cells in zzso zzso that zzso into T helper 1 zzso and T helper 2 zzso cells, which subsequently produce different zzso zzso zzso cells produce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and polarized zzso cells and the zzso cells produce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In healthy individuals there is a zzso zzso balance, but during zzso inflammation the pathogens induce an overproduction of the zzso zzso that inhibit the zzso immune response against the zzso A review of studies on the zzso zzso balance in humans harboring different tumor types revealed that tumor cells induce increased zzso zzso levels in patients' zzso that can serve as indicators for the existence of zzso In this review, studies which correlated the presence of increased zzso zzso with the presence of early tumors and tumor progression are zzso It was suggested that early monitoring of human populations for elevated zzso zzso may be used to identify individuals at an early stage of tumor zzso A hypothesis is presented which suggests that increased zzso zzso synthesis in cancer patients, with early and late tumors, may be treated with zzso zzso zzso This new approach to cancer treatment will be supplemented by zzso with zzso zzso which reactivate the zzso zzso immune zzso Studies that provide information on the efficiency of zzso zzso treatment of tumors in mice revealed that tumor zzso was achieved by inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to release large amounts of type I zzso zzso alpha and zzso which inhibit zzso zzso synthesis by zzso cells and zzso T cells and enhance zzso zzso synthesis and zzso of the zzso zzso It is hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be an effective treatment for cancer patients since zzso zzso inhibit the increased zzso zzso in zzso Such an approach may replace zzso zzso zzso zzso the current treatment for cancer zzso It is hypothesized that the effective treatment of cancer patients with zzso zzso antagonists, combined with zzso zzso will lead to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso immunity that will destroy tumor cells and cure cancer zzso
