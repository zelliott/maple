zzso screening based on structural similarity of drugs such as zzso and zzso led to identification of zzso a zzso agent that zzso the dynamic instability of zzso without affecting the total zzso mass of zzso We report a new generation of zzso derivatives as potential zzso binding zzso zzso zzso modeling experiments of these derivatives zzso zzso yielded better zzso score zzso to zzso zzso than the parent compound, zzso zzso zzso and its existing derivatives zzso to zzso zzso Free energy zzso bind ) calculations based on the linear interaction energy zzso empirical equation utilizing Surface zzso Born zzso zzso zzso model predicted the zzso affinities for the derivatives zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed highest binding affinity to zzso zzso zzso The experimental evaluation of these compounds zzso with theoretical zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso with highest binding affinity zzso 38 zzso zzso zzso which is zzso zzso times higher than that of the parent compound, zzso zzso 144 zzso zzso zzso and is also more potent than that of the first generation clinical candidate zzso zzso zzso 54 zzso zzso zzso All these compounds exhibited substantial zzso toward cancer cells, with zzso values ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso compound zzso showed prominent zzso efficacy with zzso values ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso in cancer cells of different zzso of zzso These compounds zzso DNA zzso delayed the cell cycle progression at zzso phase, and induced zzso cell death in cancer zzso zzso the study reported here identified zzso third generation zzso as new zzso zzso
