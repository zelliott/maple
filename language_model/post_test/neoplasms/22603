zzso zzso are zzso long, zzso zzso that regulate gene zzso It is known that many human zzso are zzso in numerous types of zzso Here we report the sequencing of small zzso zzso zzso from 23 breast, zzso colon and lung tumor samples using high zzso zzso We identified 49 novel zzso and zzso small zzso We further validated the expression of 10 novel small zzso in 31 different types of blood, normal and tumor tissue samples using two independent platforms, namely zzso and zzso Some of the novel sequences show a large difference in expression between tumor and zzso zzso between different tumor zzso or between different tumor zzso We also report the identification of novel small zzso classes in human: highly expressed small zzso derived from zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we identified dozens of new zzso sequence zzso that demonstrate the existence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our work extends the current knowledge of the tumor small zzso zzso and provides novel candidates for molecular zzso and drug zzso
