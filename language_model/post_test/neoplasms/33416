To identify the optimal regimen and dosage of the oral zzso target of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso study in advanced cancer patients administering oral zzso 5 to 30 zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data prompted investigation of 50 and 70 zzso weekly and daily dosing at 5 and 10 zzso 

zzso patients were zzso zzso toxicity was seen in one patient each at 50 zzso zzso and zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso the zzso dose was not zzso zzso zzso 1 activity in zzso zzso cells was inhibited for at least 7 days at doses zzso 20 zzso Area under the curve increased zzso to dose, but maximum serum concentration increased less than zzso at doses zzso 20 zzso Terminal zzso was 30 hours zzso 26 to 38 zzso zzso responses were observed in four patients, and 12 patients remained progression free for zzso 6 months, including five of 10 patients with zzso cell zzso 

zzso was zzso tolerated at zzso up to 70 zzso and 10 zzso with predictable zzso zzso activity and zzso in tumors require further clinical zzso zzso of 20 zzso and 5 zzso are recommended as appropriate starting doses for these zzso
