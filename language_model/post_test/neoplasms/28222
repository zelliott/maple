The variations of the specific zzso rate zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso phantom were investigated by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Electric zzso zzso Japan) and the opposite flat zzso of different sizes zzso zzso zzso in diameter, zzso 10 zzso in diameter, and zzso 15 zzso in zzso The influences of the distance between both zzso were also zzso zzso of the region between both zzso became weaker with the increase in size of the opposite flat zzso and it became stronger with the decrease of the distance between both zzso zzso near the flat zzso became weaker with the increase in size of the flat zzso and it showed no apparent difference with the increase of the distance between both zzso The zzso zzso values between zzso and the opposite flat zzso became smaller and its slope became steeper with the increase in size of the opposite flat zzso and in the distance between both zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the specific zzso rate zzso and zzso zzso of the region between both zzso may show the zzso of usefulness for heating the zzso of various sizes, shapes and zzso
