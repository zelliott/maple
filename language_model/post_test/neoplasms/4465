zzso zzso therapy is a new form of zzso that differs in some important respects from external beam zzso One of the most important differences is due to the finite range of zzso beta particles zzso as a result of zzso zzso The effects of particle range have important implications for the zzso of zzso 

We used a mathematical model to examine tumor zzso and its relationship to tumor size for 22 zzso zzso that may have therapeutic zzso The model assumed a uniform distribution of zzso zzso 

For targeted zzso therapy, the relationship between tumor zzso and tumor size is different from that for conventional external beam zzso With targeted zzso there is an optimal tumor size for zzso zzso smaller than the optimal size are less vulnerable to zzso from zzso because a substantial proportion of the disintegration energy escapes and is deposited outside the tumor zzso 

We found an optimal tumor size for zzso by each of the 22 zzso zzso zzso cure diameters range from less than 1 zzso for short-range zzso such as zzso and zzso to several zzso for long-range zzso such as zzso and zzso The energy zzso per disintegration may be used to predict optimal cure size for uniform zzso of zzso
