We have examined the mechanism of normal DNA zzso 1 zzso degradation as well as its mechanism of zzso in zzso We have previously reported that zzso protein levels were elevated and zzso stabilized because of defective degradation through its zzso destruction zzso Here, we report that zzso was zzso stabilized in several cancer cell lines and that, in cells with normal zzso destruction, depletion of zzso or zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso components of the zzso zzso resulted in stabilization of zzso that was partially dependent on the zzso destruction domain, thus implicating this cell cycle regulator in the destruction of zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso was shown to stabilize zzso levels, and zzso of zzso a consequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to correlate with impaired zzso phase zzso destruction and RB zzso by zzso in several normal and cancer cell zzso Furthermore, in a series of 85 cases of human breast cancer, a moderately strong, but highly zzso correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed, yielding a zzso rank order correlation zzso of zzso zzso This suggests that RB zzso zzso a common dysfunction in cancer cells, may be the underlying cause of zzso zzso
