We tested a procedure to obtain reference values based on careful clinical analysis of a population sample with the background zzso that there are conflicting reports of age effects on zzso function zzso possibly reflecting differences in numbers of sick and zzso subjects in the studied zzso and zzso that recommended procedures for the selection of reference subjects in elderly populations may give unacceptably high exclusion zzso zzso free T4 was determined by a zzso technique in a representative population of 460 males at age zzso The zzso were performed 5 years after the clinical study, and the results were zzso in relation to information obtained at the study as well as during a zzso zzso The free T4 concentration was significantly low in subjects with zzso disease and subjects with chronic zzso and significantly high in subjects taking zzso zzso zzso Selective beta zzso had no apparent zzso Information on death during the 5 years after the study proved to have no zzso The free T4 concentration was found to be zzso correlated to body mass and body mass index, a correlation which has previously not been zzso Smoking was associated with a significantly low body mass but had no apparent effect on mean free T4 zzso A procedure with successive zzso of clinically defined diagnostic groups with significantly low or high zzso concentration and/or body mass may be used to obtain reference values for zzso function and may reveal previously unknown zzso
