Cell lineage commitment and differentiation are governed by a complex gene regulatory zzso zzso of these processes by inappropriate regulatory signals and by zzso zzso of the network can lead to zzso Cancer cells often exhibit immature or embryonic traits and zzso zzso genes can act as zzso However, the prevailing paradigm of zzso evolution and zzso zzso while useful in many instances, offers no logically coherent reason for why zzso zzso zzso The formal concept of zzso zzso derived from an zzso complex systems approach to gene regulatory network may provide a natural zzso Here we present the theory of zzso in gene network dynamics and review the concept of cell types as zzso We argue that cancer cells are trapped in abnormal zzso and discuss this concept in the light of recent ideas in cancer biology, including cancer zzso and cancer stem cells, as well as the implications for differentiation zzso
