In the present study, we report the characterization of the zzso tumor zzso zzso in the 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute zzso zzso drug screen, as well as correlations between the integrity of this zzso and the zzso potency of 123 zzso agents in this zzso Assessment of zzso status in these lines was achieved through complete zzso zzso sequencing, measurement of zzso zzso protein levels and functional assessment of zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso from each line in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso phase cell cycle arrest, and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our investigations revealed that zzso gene zzso were common in the zzso cell screen zzso 39 of 58 cell lines analyzed contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from almost all of the zzso zzso cell lines failed to zzso activate a reporter gene in zzso and the majority of zzso zzso lines studied expressed elevated zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to most of the zzso zzso lines, cells containing zzso zzso sequence were also deficient in zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the ability to arrest in zzso following zzso Taken together, these assessments provided indications of the integrity of the zzso zzso in the 60 cell lines of the zzso cell zzso These individual zzso assessments were subsequently used to probe a database of zzso potency for 123 zzso zzso which included the majority of clinically approved zzso zzso These 123 agents have been tested against these lines on multiple occasions, and a proposed mechanism of drug action had previously been assigned to each zzso Our analysis revealed that cells with zzso zzso sequence tended to exhibit less growth zzso in this screen than the zzso zzso cell lines when treated with the majority of clinically used zzso zzso including DNA zzso agents, zzso and zzso I and II zzso Similar correlations were uncovered when we zzso this database using most of the other zzso of zzso status we assessed in the zzso Interestingly, a class of agents that differed in this respect was the zzso zzso zzso activity of these agents zzso in this zzso to be independent of zzso zzso Our characterization of the zzso zzso in the zzso cell screen lines should prove useful to researchers investigating fundamental aspects of zzso biology and zzso This information also allows for the large-scale analysis of the more than 60,000 compounds tested against these lines for novel agents that might exploit defective zzso function as a means of preferential zzso
