Pulmonary zzso zzso is an emerging, frequently lethal zzso infection in zzso cancer zzso We sought to characterize the zzso features of zzso in this zzso 

We identified patients with zzso who underwent autopsy or lung biopsy between 1990 and zzso zzso slides were blindly reviewed by a pathologist and findings were scored on standardized zzso zzso findings were correlated with demographic and clinical data zzso from patient's medical zzso 

Twenty patients with zzso were included in this zzso zzso patients zzso had zzso zzso High zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed, whereas inflammatory infiltrates were uncommon zzso zzso patients had more extensive zzso compared with zzso patients zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso recipients, all of whom had zzso disease, had more inflammatory cell zzso but less zzso zzso than zzso patients zzso versus zzso zzso 50% versus zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso cancer patients is characterized by extensive zzso and zzso zzso The different zzso features of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso patients may reflect differences in the zzso of zzso in these zzso
