We discuss zzso for data with repeated zzso at multiple zzso The motivating example is data with blood counts from cancer patients undergoing multiple cycles of chemotherapy, with days zzso within zzso Some zzso questions relate to repeated zzso over days within cycle, while other questions are concerned with the dependence across zzso When the desired zzso relates to both levels of repetition, it becomes important to reflect the data structure in the zzso We develop a zzso zzso modeling approach, restricting attention to two levels of repeated zzso For the zzso zzso sampling model we use random effects to introduce the desired dependence across repeated zzso We use a zzso prior for the random effects zzso zzso about dependence across zzso repetition is implemented by the zzso implied in the zzso random effects zzso zzso use of the model requires that the zzso distribution on the zzso random effects be reasonably zzso
