The aim of this article is to map the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer zzso zzso zzso onto the zzso measure to enable the zzso of health state values based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is of interest because it is the most commonly used instrument to measure the quality of life of cancer zzso 

zzso analysis is used to establish the relationship between the two zzso The performance of the model is assessed in terms of how well the responses to the zzso zzso zzso predict the zzso responses for a separate data zzso 

The results showed that the model explaining zzso values predicted zzso All of the actual values were within the zzso confidence intervals of the predicted zzso More importantly, predicted difference in zzso zzso zzso between the arms of the trial was almost identical to the actual zzso 

There is potential to estimate zzso values using responses to the zzso zzso zzso zzso measure of quality of zzso Such potential implies that in studies that do not include zzso measures, it might still be possible to estimate zzso
