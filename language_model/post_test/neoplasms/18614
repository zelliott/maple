Given that new protocols for assessing zzso cancer risk have recently been published, questions arise concerning how they compare to the zzso protocol currently used by zzso The newest protocols incorporate findings from 20 additional years of zzso Thus, differences between the zzso and newer Berman and zzso protocols are examined to evaluate whether these protocols can be zzso zzso estimated by applying these protocols to real exposure data from both laboratory and field studies are also compared to assess the relative health zzso of each zzso The reliability of risks estimated using the two protocols are compared by evaluating the degree with which each potentially reproduces the known epidemiology study zzso zzso indicate that the zzso and Berman and zzso protocols can be zzso while zzso variation within fiber type is apparently due primarily to size effects (not addressed by zzso the zzso zzso difference between zzso zzso risks estimated using each protocol is attributable to an arbitrary selection of the lowest of available zzso potency factors in the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso protocol may substantially underestimate risk when exposure is primarily to zzso zzso Moreover, while the Berman and zzso protocol is more reliable than the zzso protocol overall (especially for predicting zzso zzso evidence is presented suggesting a new zzso adjustment to the Berman and zzso protocol may ultimately succeed in reconciling the entire epidemiology zzso However, additional data need to be developed before the performance of the adjusted protocol can be fully zzso
