It is recognized that many cancer cells zzso zzso L to degrade the components of zzso zzso and basement zzso thus promoting tumor invasion and zzso However, very little information is available concerning the zzso forms of zzso L and their possible role in human zzso We initially demonstrated that approximately zzso higher mature zzso L activity was zzso in a medium of human zzso zzso zzso cells, compared with their zzso zzso A zzso zzso band, together with a zzso zzso band, was detected in the medium by our newly developed gelatin zzso The two forms were further confirmed to be zzso L by zzso zzso Both were apparently zzso directly from the cells, as neither was affected when the cells were cultured in the presence of various kinds of zzso zzso Human tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso not only the production of the zzso zzso zzso but also its zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso L activities in 3 colon and 2 lung cancer zzso were significantly higher than in normal zzso Based on the zzso there are good reasons to speculate that the zzso zzso L found in zzso zzso cell medium is involved in cancer invasion and zzso
