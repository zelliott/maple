zzso zzso zzso treatment is a useful therapy against human acute zzso leukemia zzso however, it zzso brings potential adverse consequences including serious side effect, human zzso and possible development of zzso This investigation revealed that those problems might be relaxed by simultaneous application with zzso zzso one of the major components from green zzso zzso significantly lowered down the zzso concentration required for an effective control of zzso cells, zzso The simultaneous treatment of zzso with zzso induced a zzso zzso in zzso cells significantly, which accounted for more than zzso of the cell death in the zzso The mechanism of zzso induction was zzso zzso in zzso cells acted as a zzso enhancing zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, induced zzso zzso zzso to catalyze zzso degradation, thereby provided zzso iron for zzso hydrogen zzso to zzso Fenton reaction, which in turn generated deleterious zzso oxygen species to damage zzso In addition, zzso inhibited expression of zzso which supposedly to zzso harmful zzso iron, thereby zzso the occurrence of Fenton zzso This investigation also provided evidence that zzso since mainly acted to induce zzso in simultaneous treatment with zzso could be replaced by other zzso zzso with much less human zzso Furthermore, several of our preliminary investigations revealed that the enhanced zzso induced by combining zzso degradation and Fenton reaction is selectively toxic to zzso but not zzso zzso
