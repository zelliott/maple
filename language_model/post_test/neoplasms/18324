Cancer patients show large individual variation in their response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso have shown significant activity against a variety of zzso We previously used expression data from a zzso cell zzso model system to identify genes that might be important for the two drug zzso In the present study, we used that same model system to perform a zzso association zzso study to test the hypothesis that common genetic variation might influence both gene expression and response to the two zzso Specifically, zzso single zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression data were obtained using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Plus zzso zzso respectively, for 174 zzso zzso Variation zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed to obtain zzso values for the cell zzso We then performed zzso studies with zzso gene expression and zzso of these two zzso This approach identified zzso that were associated with zzso or zzso zzso values and with the expression regulation for 29 genes or 30 zzso zzso One zzso in zzso zzso was significantly associated with variation in both the expression of multiple genes and zzso and zzso zzso A second zzso in zzso zzso was also significantly associated with multiple gene expression and zzso zzso To confirm the association results, we performed zzso knock down of selected genes with expression that was associated with zzso and zzso in tumor cell and the knock down altered zzso or zzso sensitivity, confirming our association study zzso These results suggest that the application of zzso approaches using zzso model systems, when combined with complementary functional zzso can provide insights into mechanisms responsible for variation in zzso analogue zzso
