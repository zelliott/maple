We previously reported that zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso expressed in normal and zzso zzso is considerably higher in cancer cell lines than in normal zzso In our present study, we established that certain cancer cell lines express conspicuously higher levels of the 2 zzso zzso in contrast to the 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells in zzso induced extensive zzso while zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice caused significant tumor zzso in zzso Compared to zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso treatment of zzso and zzso zzso cells resulted in markedly more pronounced cell death, whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited less prominent zzso Cell viability and zzso were zzso by flow zzso membrane integrity, zzso zzso V zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression culminated in zzso expression of zzso TRAIL and zzso but zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and led to zzso zzso and zzso zzso but diminished expression of zzso zzso TRAIL and zzso The participation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso expression was also zzso These data support the zzso and cell survival role of zzso especially in zzso cells, and its interaction with specific genes and proteins involved in the zzso and cell cycle zzso
