zzso zzso participate in several zzso functions including zzso growth and zzso and facilitate almost every step of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso functions may therefore provide an important strategy in the clinical management of cancer and zzso zzso Our understanding of zzso functions has been greatly expanded by direct observations of zzso cell interactions using light zzso Imaging approaches include zzso zzso of zzso in mouse models of cancer and zzso of zzso cell interactions in in zzso zzso whether atop zzso zzso embedded in zzso zzso or in more complex zzso of multiple cell types that mimic specific zzso of the zzso zzso Such imaging and zzso approaches have provided us with a wealth of information on the zzso zzso and physical associations between zzso and zzso cells and the role of the zzso zzso in influencing the movement of these zzso Finally, high-resolution imaging techniques have permitted researchers to correlate zzso patterns with specific gene signatures and zzso pathways in cells, pointing to potential targets for zzso Here, we review experimental approaches employed in the study of zzso interactions with zzso cells with an emphasis on imaging invasive and zzso cell zzso in breast zzso
