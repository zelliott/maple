Cancer is associated with zzso zzso and analysis of zzso genetic zzso is increasingly used for zzso zzso and treatment zzso The genetic profile of solid zzso is currently obtained from surgical or biopsy zzso however, the latter procedure cannot always be performed routinely zzso to its invasive zzso Information acquired from a single biopsy provides a zzso and temporally limited zzso of a zzso and might fail to reflect its zzso zzso cells release circulating free DNA zzso into the blood, but the majority of circulating DNA is often not of zzso origin, and detection of zzso zzso in the blood has long been impossible to zzso zzso advances have overcome these zzso making it possible to identify both genetic and zzso zzso A liquid zzso or blood sample, can provide the genetic landscape of all zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as offering the opportunity to systematically track zzso zzso This Review will explore how zzso zzso zzso in the blood can be used in the clinic after diagnosis, including the assessment of zzso early detection of disease zzso and as surrogates for traditional zzso with the purpose of predicting response to treatments and the development of acquired zzso
