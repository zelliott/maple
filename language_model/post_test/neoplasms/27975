zzso cell signal zzso arising from protein zzso zzso has been implicated in the initiation and progression of a variety of human zzso Over the past 2 decades pharmaceutical and university laboratories have been involved in a tremendous effort to develop compounds that can selectively zzso these abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso especially the zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been at the forefront of this effort as a result of strong clinical data zzso zzso of these receptors with more aggressive zzso There are a variety of strategies under development for zzso the zzso activity of these zzso targeting both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso approaches, zzso and zzso zzso agents use the zzso domain for targeted zzso zzso Small zzso zzso target the zzso zzso region by interfering with zzso zzso while zzso peptides are aimed at the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso that inhibit subsequent downstream signals from the zzso by interrupting zzso protein recognition sequences are also being zzso In the past 5 years enormous progress has been made in developing zzso zzso inhibitor compounds with sufficient zzso zzso and selectivity against this zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso for patients with zzso breast cancer is the first of these inhibitor compounds to gain zzso zzso However, zzso and clinical trials are ongoing with a variety of other zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although their zzso and zzso potential has been zzso they are not likely to replace standard chemotherapy regimens as zzso zzso zzso Instead, their promising additive and synergistic zzso effects in combination with standard zzso suggest that these novel agents will find their greatest utility and efficacy in conjunction with existing zzso zzso
