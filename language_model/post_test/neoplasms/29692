Using an zzso raised against zzso zzso factor zzso we have developed a zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso was previously shown to bind to both human and animal zzso extracts and to inhibit the zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso from rat Walker zzso was used for zzso by the zzso zzso An excess of zzso zzso was incubated with zzso zzso in the absence zzso zzso and presence zzso of maximum zzso of zzso tissue zzso A double zzso technique was used to separate free and bound zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso The extent of zzso of zzso binding provided a measure of zzso in tissue extracts zzso zzso of normal bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso and normal human zzso and liver were zzso Only bovine zzso and human zzso were found to contain zzso zzso These findings, together with our earlier results, suggest that zzso factor from both bovine zzso and human zzso induce zzso in zzso and possess common zzso zzso The presence of zzso factor in healthy zzso and its relationship to zzso in clinical conditions is zzso
