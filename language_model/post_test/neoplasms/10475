To determine the safety and zzso of zzso at escalating doses and its effects on zzso relevant for zzso activity in patients with solid zzso 

Patients with solid zzso zzso to or for which no standard effective therapy exists were enrolled onto zzso zzso and treated with oral zzso once daily zzso 

zzso patients were studied at doses of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the first cycle (21 zzso included grade 3 fatigue in a patient at 10 zzso grade 3 zzso and grade 3 hypertension in two separate patients at zzso zzso and grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 zzso in two separate patients at zzso zzso which was the zzso zzso Other significant zzso adverse events included zzso hand and foot zzso and zzso zzso clearance of zzso was zzso with a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso hours, with no evidence of drug zzso at day zzso Two patients with lung cancer and one patient with colon cancer achieved partial zzso zzso disease for more than four cycles was observed in 16 patients zzso Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso showed zzso reduced tumor vascular zzso that correlated with drug zzso By day 15 of treatment, circulating zzso cells were significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso whereas plasma vascular zzso growth factor was increased zzso zzso zzso 

zzso by continuous zzso dosing was tolerable at doses zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence of zzso activity and zzso evidence of tumor zzso were observed together with promising clinical zzso
