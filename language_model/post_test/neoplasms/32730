The zzso zzso zzso is the plasma membrane zzso that mediates the active zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso the crucial first step in zzso hormone zzso zzso also mediates zzso zzso in other zzso such as zzso zzso gastric zzso and zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso cancer cells to actively transport zzso via zzso provides a unique and effective delivery system to detect and target these cells for destruction with therapeutic doses of zzso Breast cancer is the only zzso other than zzso cancer to have been shown to functionally express zzso zzso The considerable potential diagnostic and therapeutic use of zzso in breast cancer is currently being zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso gene transfer has successfully been carried out into a variety of other cell lines and tumors, including zzso human melanoma tumors, and zzso zzso cancer, human zzso and zzso cell zzso Most notably, significant zzso therapy results have been obtained in the zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso and in zzso myeloma cells, both of which exhibited prolonged retention of radio zzso even in the absence of zzso zzso The therapeutic potential of alternative zzso zzso with different zzso properties and a zzso physical zzso than zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been zzso In conclusion, it is clear that the remarkable progress made in the last few years in the molecular characterization of zzso has created new opportunities for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic applications for zzso in nuclear zzso
