zzso zzso zzso is a necrosis avid compound used as a complementary zzso zzso zzso the zzso in rats with zzso partial liver zzso zzso was used to estimate its human internal radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso as a safer surrogate for zzso was prepared with zzso as zzso zzso of zzso yield and zzso was performed by high performance liquid zzso zzso To control zzso the zzso was zzso and microscopically zzso zzso of zzso was studied in zzso zzso at 4, 24 and zzso zzso zzso gamma counting zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso in zzso necrosis and in normal human zzso was estimated using zzso data of zzso the zzso Level Internal zzso zzso Modeling zzso a sphere model and male and female zzso A zzso yield of zzso was achieved in labeling of zzso with a zzso purity of zzso after zzso zzso In the zzso added zzso no zzso but minimal microscopic zzso was zzso By zzso selective zzso in zzso zzso and low zzso in viable liver of zzso were zzso as confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso higher doses of zzso were delivered to zzso zzso than to viable zzso liver zzso In normal zzso zzso was eliminated within zzso except for relatively high levels in the lungs and zzso zzso elimination was a major zzso of zzso causing high activity in the zzso For both zzso zzso showed the longest residence time of zzso in the zzso followed by the zzso zzso and zzso The highest absorbed radiation dose was seen in zzso zzso and the shortest residence times and lowest absorbed radiation dose were found in the zzso zzso selectively delivers higher radiation dose to necrosis compared with the rest of the zzso Among normal zzso zzso lungs and zzso receive considerable radiation dose, which deserves cautious attention in developing this zzso zzso
