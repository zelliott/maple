zzso are under intensive study for the treatment and prevention of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso are a major obstacle to this zzso In a recent retrospective analysis of combined zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso toxicity was reduced significantly and zzso activity was zzso These results suggested the need for prospective testing of this new zzso This trial tested the hypotheses that At can reduce toxicity of high-dose zzso and does not interfere with zzso zzso as reflected by reduced zzso serum zzso 

This was a phase I trial design in which patients received zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso AT zzso at 800 zzso increased 400 zzso each month until 2000 zzso We collected toxicity data every four weeks from self-report forms, clinical examinations and laboratory zzso AT effects on zzso toxicity were determined by comparing maximum toxicity at lowest AT dose with that at highest AT zzso We also measured serum levels of both agents every four zzso 

Of the 45 patients zzso 36 had cancer zzso or prior zzso 9 had zzso zzso Thirty-nine patients could be evaluated for zzso zzso 31 for final course zzso Median time on treatment (all zzso was four months zzso zzso zzso a total of 223 zzso courses of treatment were zzso zzso percent of patients zzso developed grade 3 or 4 toxicity in the initial zzso The rates of increase and decrease in zzso toxicity associated with increasing AT doses were zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso At did not reduce zzso serum zzso After initial increases of mean AT plasma levels zzso zzso zzso at baseline to zzso zzso after first four-week course), subsequent AT plasma increases zzso zzso did not keep pace with increased AT doses zzso No major activity occurred in the 21 patients with active zzso zzso The complete response rate in patients with zzso zzso or lung zzso was zzso zzso which included two patients previously zzso to zzso zzso 

Although escalating doses of AT did not reduce zzso zzso the rate of zzso (including 800 zzso of zzso high-grade toxicity was substantially lower than that typical of high-dose zzso and similar to that typical of zzso zzso Indeed, a trial of zzso followed by zzso plus AT may have detected a significant toxicity zzso We did not design such a trial out of ethical concern for known side effects of high-dose zzso The increase in AT serum levels was not zzso with increasing doses of zzso which may explain the lack of a zzso effect of AT on zzso zzso Previous trials have established that zzso has an approximate zzso complete response rate in oral zzso Our small zzso zzso complete response rate in zzso zzso suggests that AT may enhance zzso clinical zzso Future trials of zzso plus AT are needed to define this combinations toxicity profile, clinical activity and zzso
