zzso strength zzso has been shown to predict survival and is associated with changes in body zzso nutritional status, zzso and functional ability in several chronic disease zzso Whether similar relationships exist between zzso and clinical outcomes in patients with advanced cancer are currently zzso We evaluated the association between zzso and survival as well as several key markers of body composition zzso zzso zzso performance measures zzso quality of zzso and muscle strength zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in patients with advanced forms of zzso cell lung and gastrointestinal zzso 

A consecutive cohort of zzso patients with advanced cancer was enrolled and zzso into three zzso zzso zzso zzso 25th, and zzso according to published zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were used to test for independent associations between zzso and survival, zzso quality of life zzso and lower zzso muscle strength as well as key biological markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while controlling for age, zzso cancer diagnosis, treatment zzso medications, and time from diagnosis to zzso 

When compared to zzso zzso patients in the zzso zzso zzso had lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso shorter survival zzso ratio, zzso zzso lower zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso greater occurrence of zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso lower zzso zzso of the zzso at both zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso lower zzso zzso on McGill Quality of Life zzso zzso zzso to zzso higher levels of fatigue zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso poorer performance status zzso on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance zzso zzso zzso lower fat mass zzso zzso to zzso and lower lean body mass zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso is independently associated with survival and important zzso functional, and quality of life characteristics in advanced cancer zzso Patients presenting with very low zzso with respect to their zzso assessment may require timely referral to supportive and/or zzso care zzso
