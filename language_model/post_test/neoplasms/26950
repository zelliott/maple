With the smooth move towards the coming expected clinical reports of zzso pharmaceutical molecules targeting zzso and zzso and also with the exciting success in the extension of lifespan by regulating zzso activity without increased onset of zzso in laboratory mouse models zzso et zzso 2006; zzso et zzso zzso we are convinced that targeting zzso based on zzso will be a potential approach to zzso both aging and cancer and the idea of longevity seems to be no more zzso More interestingly, emerging zzso from clinical research reveal that other zzso factors, like specific zzso binding proteins and zzso zzso associated proteins also show crucial importance in aging and zzso This stems from their roles in the stability of zzso structure and in the zzso of DNA damage response at zzso zzso these proteins from zzso ends leads to dramatic zzso loss and zzso dysfunction which is more abrupt than those induced by zzso zzso zzso expression of these factors results in zzso failure, aging and even zzso evidenced by several experimental models and clinical cases, indicating zzso specific proteins and its associated proteins have complimentary roles to zzso in zzso protection and controlling cellular zzso Thus, these zzso factors might be potential clinical zzso for early detection or even therapeutic targets of aging and zzso Future studies to zzso how these proteins function in zzso protection might benefit patients suffering aging or cancer who are not sensitive to zzso zzso
