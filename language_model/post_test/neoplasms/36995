zzso of zzso deletions on human zzso zzso has led to the isolation of a candidate tumor zzso zzso zzso that appears to be zzso at considerable frequency in human zzso In preliminary screens, zzso of zzso were detected in zzso zzso of zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso of prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso of breast cancer cell lines and zzso and zzso zzso of primary zzso The predicted zzso product has a protein zzso zzso domain and extensive zzso to zzso a protein that interacts with zzso filaments at focal zzso These zzso suggest that zzso may suppress tumor cell growth by zzso protein zzso zzso and may regulate tumor cell invasion and zzso through interactions at focal zzso
