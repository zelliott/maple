zzso zzso zzso has been shown to have promise in short-term liver transplantation graft rescue zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of zzso in liver transplant patients who had failed zzso zzso conventional zzso 

zzso zzso liver zzso recipients were converted from zzso to zzso in combination with zzso and prednisone in this zzso zzso zzso graft rescue, pilot zzso Six patients were taken off zzso when zzso was zzso A zzso patient follow-up is reported zzso Patients were considered to have failed zzso zzso either for zzso zzso chronic zzso or severe zzso zzso zzso 

Twelve patients had complete zzso resolution, two had partial resolution, and three had worsening of their zzso Thirteen patients had a complete zzso zzso one had a partial response and four had worsening of their zzso Two patients had no zzso and one no zzso zzso Of the six patients treated with zzso and prednisone alone, four had complete resolution of rejection without zzso The majority of adverse reactions were gastrointestinal zzso and/or vomiting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso or bone zzso zzso zzso zzso anemia zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso seems to be an effective alternative zzso in patients failing zzso conventional zzso zzso may be of particular benefit in patients who do not tolerate zzso or zzso The long-term safety profile is similar to that of other zzso
