To evaluate the zzso zzso and zzso efficacy of a novel orally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso potency was determined in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso efficacy was evaluated in zzso and zzso models in combination with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso is a potent inhibitor of both zzso and zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The compound has good oral zzso and crosses the zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso dramatically increased the efficacy of zzso at zzso doses as low as zzso zzso and a zzso efficacy achieved at 25 zzso In the zzso zzso rat zzso model, zzso alone exhibited minimal zzso whereas zzso when combined with zzso significantly slowed tumor zzso In the zzso breast zzso model zzso deletion and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso causing zzso of established tumors, whereas with comparable doses of zzso agents alone, only modest tumor zzso was zzso Finally, zzso zzso radiation (2 zzso zzso 10) in an zzso colon zzso zzso In each model, zzso did not display zzso zzso 

zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso has good oral zzso can cross the zzso barrier, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and radiation in zzso and zzso tumor zzso This broad spectrum of zzso and zzso makes this compound an attractive candidate for clinical zzso
