zzso of drug-resistant human tumor cells with a combination of zzso and zzso has zzso effect on the cellular retention and zzso of zzso In patients administered a fixed dose of zzso and zzso with escalating doses of zzso mean plasma levels of zzso and zzso achieved were as high as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma samples from patients were analyzed in an in zzso zzso to monitor the effect on the cellular retention of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In 22 of 49 of the plasma samples zzso the zzso in zzso blocking activity was one-half or greater than that of cells incubated with zzso zzso zzso a well-known zzso zzso These observations suggest that a combination of zzso and zzso may enhance cellular zzso retention by blocking zzso while reducing normal tissue toxicity and unwanted side effects in zzso
