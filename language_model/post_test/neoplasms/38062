Changes in life history are expected when new sources of zzso mortality impact on natural zzso We report a new disease, devil facial tumor disease, causing an abrupt transition from zzso toward single breeding in the largest extant carnivorous zzso the zzso devil zzso zzso in which males can weigh as much as 14 zzso and females 9 zzso This change in life history is associated with almost complete mortality of individuals from this infectious cancer past their first year of adult zzso Devils have shown their capacity to respond to this zzso increased adult mortality with a zzso increase in the proportion of individuals exhibiting precocious sexual zzso These patterns are documented in five populations where there are data from before and after disease arrival and subsequent population zzso To our knowledge, this is the first known case of infectious disease leading to increased early reproduction in a zzso The persistence of both this disease and the associated zzso changes pose questions about longer-term evolutionary responses and conservation prospects for this iconic zzso
