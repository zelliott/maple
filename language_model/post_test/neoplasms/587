In order to determine whether host factors may contribute to the generation of tumor zzso the zzso stability of cells from a cloned tumor was examined during proliferation in tissue culture and in the zzso zzso Growth of this cloned tumor was initiated both in zzso and in zzso and the tumor populations were sampled at different time intervals by zzso The zzso of these tumor zzso to the zzso action of natural zzso and complement was used as a marker of their membrane zzso The extent of zzso variation of the clones in one sample was considered to be a measure of tumor zzso Following these procedures, we observed that a clone of the zzso zzso zzso maintained its zzso during 5 months of in zzso zzso In contrast, a single passage of the same tumor clone for 3 1/2 weeks or 3 months in the zzso host resulted in the generation of a population of cells exhibiting a significant increase in zzso This relative instability of tumor zzso in zzso suggests that the host milieu may allow the generation of tumor zzso zzso or zzso zzso may be involved although the high frequency of new zzso argues against a role for zzso zzso
