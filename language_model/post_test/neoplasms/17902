zzso zzso zzso are thought to have acquired zzso properties that contribute to zzso We have tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso suppress zzso gene zzso leading to enhanced cellular zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in several human cell lines was found to lead to the zzso of zzso zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of these genes was also suppressed in zzso zzso cell lines expressing various zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso the zzso zzso these zzso zzso zzso were able to suppress a variety of zzso gene zzso Analysis using the zzso zzso promoter construct indicated that the zzso sites are zzso for zzso zzso zzso However, treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in relief of zzso zzso suppression, suggesting that zzso zzso may induce zzso of target gene promoters leading to the zzso zzso Finally, we show that stable zzso of zzso zzso expression resulted in reduced cellular colony growth in human cancer cells, which was found to be due to the induction of zzso Together, the results demonstrate another mechanism through which zzso zzso could promote cellular zzso
