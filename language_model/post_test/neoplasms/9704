The importance of cellular communication with the zzso zzso in regulating cellular invasion is well zzso Selective disruption of communication links between cells and the local zzso by specifically targeting zzso zzso cryptic zzso zzso zzso may represent an effective new clinical approach to limit zzso zzso zzso we sought to determine whether the zzso cryptic collagen zzso plays a functional role in regulating zzso in zzso 

We examined the expression and characterized the zzso cryptic collagen zzso in zzso and in zzso using zzso and zzso We examined potential mechanisms by which this cryptic collagen zzso may regulate zzso using in zzso cell zzso migration, zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we examined the whether blocking cellular interactions with the zzso cryptic zzso plays a role in zzso and tumor growth in zzso using the chick zzso zzso 

The zzso cryptic zzso was selectively exposed within tumor blood vessel zzso zzso whereas little was associated with zzso zzso An zzso directed to this cryptic site selectively inhibited zzso cell zzso migration, and proliferation on zzso collagen type IV and induced increased levels of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

We provide evidence for a new functional cryptic regulatory element within collagen IV that regulates tumor zzso These findings suggest a novel and highly selective approach for regulating zzso by targeting a zzso cryptic collagen zzso
