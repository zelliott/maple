In this study, we evaluated the ability of combination regimens of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to induce effective killer cells against human tumors in zzso in peripheral blood zzso zzso from 15 cancer patients and mixed zzso culture zzso cells from 16 cancer patients, and carried out a zzso analysis of the cells responsible for the zzso of the human zzso The freshly prepared zzso were cultivated with zzso alone or zzso for 10 days zzso killer zzso cell generation zzso The zzso cells zzso cultured with zzso zzso zzso tumor cells for 3 zzso were further cultivated with zzso or zzso for 7 days zzso T zzso zzso generation zzso The zzso activities of the zzso cells cultivated with zzso were significantly zzso in both the zzso and zzso generation systems, as compared with those of cells treated with zzso zzso In the zzso generation system, the zzso activities of the cells cultivated with zzso were significantly decreased by the method of negative selection of zzso or zzso cells using zzso zzso The zzso cells showed a slight decrease of zzso The killer cell activities of the zzso cells remained zzso In the zzso generation system, the activity was markedly reduced by the elimination of the zzso or zzso or zzso zzso The combined data suggested that zzso killer zzso cells in the zzso generation system were mainly of the natural killer zzso type, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partly possible zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso T cells mixed with cells of the zzso type, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, were the population of killer zzso cells induced by zzso in the zzso generation zzso
