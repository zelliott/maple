zzso zzso are defined by an annual zzso below zzso zzso new zzso According to this definition, zzso of zzso in the European Union are rare zzso These zzso are associated with considerable excess zzso as they account for close to zzso of all cancer deaths within the zzso This article reviews the specific management challenges pertaining to this group of zzso diseases, but also the research opportunities they represent for the entire field of zzso The principal challenges are related to their low zzso inaccurate diagnosis is frequent (up to zzso of zzso and initial management does always not follow clinical practice guidelines because of their limited diffusion in the medical zzso These patients are also zzso in clinical trials, because of the rarity of dedicated clinical trials in both the academic and industrial zzso The situation has evolved in recent years, however, because it is increasingly recognized that rare zzso offer major opportunities for clinical zzso Indeed, the underlying molecular zzso are easier to identify than those responsible for frequent zzso Other advances include the development of novel statistical methods, the unification of academic and industrial clinical research projects, the integration of patient advocacy groups in research programs, and importantly, paradigm shifts such as the development of zzso zzso zzso for zzso and other zzso tissue zzso With the increasing fragmentation of frequent tumors into zzso of rare tumors, as exemplified by lung cancer, many frequent tumors will need to be managed with approaches similar to those developed in recent years for rare zzso In the age of routine molecular biology, the challenges of clinical research on rare tumors are thus becoming the challenges of all clinical research in zzso This will required extensive multinational collaboration within the European Union and zzso
