There is a great need for techniques that detect the zzso zzso present in cancer zzso Here, we present a review of the arbitrarily primed zzso chain reaction zzso a zzso zzso detection method with some unique zzso zzso It can detect most types of zzso that usually occur in tumors (except point zzso zzso It is especially useful to detect moderate gains in DNA, which most methods currently in use cannot zzso zzso It allows detection and cloning of zzso in a single zzso zzso It is inexpensive and does not require special zzso We discuss some characteristics of this method and review some of its achievements in cancer zzso
