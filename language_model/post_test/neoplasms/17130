It has been proposed that the well-studied zzso platinum complex zzso zzso forms DNA zzso similar to those of the trans platinum complex zzso zzso zzso Thus this latter could be the active form of zzso zzso studies on the mechanism of zzso action were performed in this zzso zzso indicate that zzso has significantly higher zzso activity than zzso and is comparable to zzso Cellular zzso experiments indicate that zzso can be efficiently accumulated in zzso cancer zzso zzso of zzso to DNA mainly produces zzso zzso zzso these zzso can be recognized by the zzso zzso zzso studies on the reaction with zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso is much lower than that of zzso and is more similar to that of zzso zzso a widely investigated zzso active zzso platinum zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso is significantly zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso zzso is highly zzso These results indicate that the mechanism of zzso differs not only from that of zzso inactive zzso but also from that of zzso active zzso and this could account for the remarkable activity of parent zzso
