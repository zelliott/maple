General zzso studies in cancer patients have stressed zzso of zzso function and have commonly ignored the zzso zzso A preliminary study of peripheral blood zzso function was undertaken in a group of 90 cancer patients (18 breast, 32 zzso 13 head and neck, 9 zzso and 18 zzso and 70 zzso Studies included zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of differentiation into zzso zzso precursor test: zzso evaluation of zzso cellular zzso zzso and spontaneous cellular zzso zzso as measured with human zzso and zzso of zzso and serum zzso zzso Breast cancer patients had normal zzso zzso cancer patients showed the most profound abnormalities with decreased zzso and zzso and increased zzso and zzso Patients with Stage I and Stage II melanoma had normal profiles, whereas those with advanced melanoma had significantly decreased zzso This zzso was restored in two patients by zzso zzso Head and neck cancer and benign breast disease patients had decreased zzso whereas patients with lung cancer had increased zzso zzso zzso production was unchanged in the cancer patients compared to zzso zzso zzso levels, however, were significantly increased in patients with zzso of the zzso head and neck, and zzso Although patients with localized breast cancer and melanoma had normal levels, these were increased in both patient groups with advanced zzso It would appear that the source of the increased serum zzso is probably not the peripheral blood zzso but could have originated in the zzso or zzso zzso which were not zzso zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso function were zzso in certain types of cancer patients but were fully normal in others, and did not show consistent correlations with tumor type or zzso zzso or zzso zzso might provide a more fruitful area for study in these disease zzso
