Experimental conditions are described for the detection of steroid receptors in tissue sections or cells at the light microscope zzso Current knowledge about the zzso distribution of these receptors is zzso the mechanisms of their nuclear zzso are zzso zzso signals involved in nuclear zzso are characterized by means of in zzso zzso of steroid zzso zzso Studies zzso the zzso distribution of various zzso zzso zzso in energy depleted cells together with fusion experiments provide evidence for zzso shuttling of zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso location of the wild type zzso zzso reflects a dynamic equilibrium between active nuclear import and outward zzso We also describe the use of zzso in pathology, especially for the detection of steroid receptors in hormone dependent zzso
