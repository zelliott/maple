The zzso software represents a general tool to perform internal radiation zzso It uses a three-dimensional lattice in which to conduct radiation zzso scoring energy deposition in discrete zzso The zzso system currently relies on the same zzso used by the zzso committee for zzso zzso and assumes local deposition of particulate zzso A mathematical description of the zzso system's zzso is zzso Additionally, a characterization of the system with respect to memory requirements, data libraries used, and simulation timing zzso is zzso zzso of the software is presented in a companion zzso
