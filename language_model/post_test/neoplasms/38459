Limited information exists about the clinical and biological features of zzso zzso zzso particularly those that follow high-dose therapeutic zzso We report our experience with 20 patients with zzso (16 following high-dose zzso treated at our institution from zzso Patients zzso female, 6 zzso had intervals from first zzso to zzso diagnosis of zzso years; 12 had at least one zzso occur at an zzso of 30 years or more after initial zzso Multiple zzso were seen in six patients, with one patient developing his six zzso zzso over a 22-year zzso Most zzso could be managed zzso either with a single extensive zzso or additional zzso zzso zzso zzso external beam radiation, or chemotherapy were required in a minority zzso zzso zzso Most were WHO grade I zzso Complex zzso were found in three of four cases and abnormalities of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso were identified in five of 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso 5) compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and a panel of other tumors zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was similar to that seen in zzso and by zzso analysis did not separate from zzso However, zzso comparative zzso analysis did demonstrate a few genes with significant differences in the expression level in zzso versus zzso Of note, zzso was zzso in four of five zzso zzso zzso zzso at a similar level as measured in zzso
