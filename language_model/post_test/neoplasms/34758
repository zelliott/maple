Emerging technologies in radiation therapy computers and delivery systems allow surgically precise zzso radiation treatment that was not possible with previous generations of zzso The newest treatment systems can compensate for tumor target motion as well as shape dose zzso to conform precisely to delineated target zzso These sophisticated technologies now drive the development of imaging zzso able to generate equally high-resolution and zzso zzso that are the foundation of these highly accurate radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently becoming a routine imaging tool for radiation zzso because of its combined benefits of zzso imaging and high-resolution zzso zzso The improved staging and zzso zzso provided by zzso combined with the zzso zzso display provided by CT, now allows better treatment zzso and more precise zzso Additionally, zzso zzso CT and zzso zzso have been used in the simulation process for zzso radiation zzso zzso integration of zzso into the radiation therapy planning process requires an understanding of how therapy plans are derived and the process by which the patient receives therapy, because these dictate the method of image zzso The radiation zzso too, must understand the technology of zzso imaging to adapt these functional images based on zzso rather than zzso to their targeting zzso zzso to the zzso scanner and room are necessary to image the patient in the zzso position required for treatment zzso Although the impact of these efforts on patient outcome has yet to be determined, the benefit of better treatment choice, due to improved staging, and more precise targeting with less normal tissue exposure resulting in improved quality of life will likely promote zzso to the zzso for targeted zzso
