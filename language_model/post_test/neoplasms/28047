Because zzso tumor zzso zzso increases tumor zzso zzso greater than zzso number, we studied the effect of zzso on tumor cell growth in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso melanoma, human zzso colon zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso cell growth was measured after 3 to 7 days in zzso fetal calf serum zzso + zzso zzso We found that, whereas relatively low zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso enhance tumor cell growth in zzso approximately zzso to zzso higher zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso impaired cell growth approximately zzso to zzso zzso cell growth was associated with cell cycle arrest at zzso and increased zzso DNA, as well as zzso measured by tumor cell binding to zzso V and zzso zzso zzso was reversed with the general zzso zzso zzso The enhancing and zzso effects were specific for zzso zzso with inactive zzso zzso and zzso via the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso use of a cell line, zzso devoid of the 3 other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso greater sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells to impaired cell zzso 3- and zzso zzso Thus, zzso has a zzso effect on zzso in tumor zzso enhanced growth at low zzso impaired zzso at higher zzso
