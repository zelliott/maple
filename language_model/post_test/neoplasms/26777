In this work, the zzso zzso heating characteristics of various viscous zzso with either soft zzso zzso or hard zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated to zzso and physically interpret the contribution of zzso relaxation loss power, zzso relaxation zzso or zzso relaxation loss power, zzso relaxation zzso to the total zzso heat generation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso It was found that the contribution of zzso relaxation zzso to the total zzso heating power, zzso and the specific loss power zzso was severely affected by the surrounding environment (or zzso zzso while the contribution of zzso relaxation zzso to the zzso was independent of the variation of surrounding zzso Furthermore, all the theoretical and experimental results strongly suggested that highly zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso can be achieved by enhancing the zzso relaxation zzso rather than the zzso relaxation zzso of zzso agents in zzso
