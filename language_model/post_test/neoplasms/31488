zzso variations in the zzso virus zzso zzso membrane protein 1 gene have been described in numerous zzso tumors with some of these variations, most notably a zzso pair deletion in the zzso zzso domain, suggested as associated with an increase in zzso In this study, zzso DNA sequence was determined from 92 tissue specimens or cell lines, including zzso zzso oral zzso zzso zzso lymphoma, zzso without pathology, zzso zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso and normal from distinct geographical zzso The zzso and zzso sequences and, in some cases, the full-length sequences of zzso membrane protein 1 were zzso zzso sequence patterns distinguished zzso with the zzso sequence being the most zzso in distinguishing among the zzso zzso relationships between strains were determined, as were signature zzso acid changes that discriminate between zzso A correlation between strain and disease or strain and geographic location was not zzso The sequence variation and signature sequences identified at least seven distinct zzso as well as hybrid strains that apparently result from zzso
