The paper presents a review of data on the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso system genes and their relationship with human diseases, mainly zzso Genes of zzso system proteins are located at the sites of zzso of the structural zzso aberrations in zzso Thus, any of them are rearranged or zzso in various tumor zzso As the activity of these genes plays a role in cancer development, their zzso may be one of the crucial points in the zzso of some cancer zzso Besides, they also take part in zzso immunity against viral zzso zzso experiments with zzso system genes have proved the influence of these genes on cancer behavior and may serve as a basis for clinical gene zzso zzso and zzso genes are located at zzso the site of frequent zzso deletions in zzso Their loss zzso cells to the growth zzso actions of zzso zzso The zzso zzso a representative of class II zzso is located at zzso zzso of class II zzso genes to cancer cell lines causes cell proliferation arrest and zzso the expression of zzso zzso which may be clinically useful in stimulating the immune destruction of tumor zzso The zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso gene is located at zzso the site of common deletions in zzso syndromes zzso and secondary zzso The loss of zzso of this gene was found in zzso which proves that zzso may be a tumor zzso A zzso of its gene causes zzso transformation zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso gene is located at zzso a region which is frequently rearranged in zzso zzso of a wild type zzso gene reverses zzso transformation caused by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso proving that zzso acts as a dominant negative cancer zzso
