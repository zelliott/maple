Most previous studies of the induction of tumor cell zzso by zzso have been conducted with zzso very much higher than those used zzso An investigation of the ability of zzso to induce zzso at its clinical concentration zzso zzso was therefore zzso zzso was tested by zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of early zzso and necrosis by zzso cell zzso zzso analysis with zzso V and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and -9 by zzso of specific zzso DNA fragmentation by zzso gel zzso radical intensity and zzso scavenging activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed higher zzso against human tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso than against normal human cells zzso zzso zzso The clinical concentration of zzso produced early zzso markers in zzso and zzso cells whereas it induced higher numbers of zzso cells in zzso cells, both in a zzso zzso The clinical concentration of zzso failed to activate any zzso species and induced only trace amounts of zzso DNA zzso in contrast to zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso group, showed higher zzso and zzso scavenging activity than zzso in which the zzso group at zzso was replaced with a zzso group, suggesting the involvement of a zzso zzso The present report may offer new strategies for treatment and prevention of cancer using a clinical concentration of zzso not only as an zzso but also as an zzso or necrosis zzso
