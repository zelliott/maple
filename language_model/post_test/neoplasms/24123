zzso oxygen species zzso are known to mediate zzso zzso activity by zzso the cellular zzso zzso zzso The aim of the study is to evaluate whether cancer patients show more zzso after zzso 

zzso were evaluated in 32 zzso zzso zzso Blood samples were collected both before and after the end of zzso zzso detection of zzso was performed by using zzso test zzso 

After therapy all patients showed a marked increase in zzso zzso zzso 35 U zzso compared to values measured before therapy zzso zzso 62 U Carr, p zzso zzso This result was more evident during the first course of zzso No significant differences were observed between patients who received radio or zzso 

In conclusion both radio and chemotherapy induce zzso stress by increasing radical oxygen species, exceeding the zzso capacities of cancer zzso This is useful for therapeutic purposes but may enhance the zzso induced by zzso
