Attempts to raise effective immunity against cancer are benefiting from information on the nature of the immunity involved and its regulation and, perhaps, now it is time to step back and define our approach in molecular terms prior to clinical zzso Although there are zzso differences between mice and patients, results from zzso studies are encouraging early zzso of concepts to the clinic and it is vital to take zzso principles emerging from mice into clinical vaccine zzso One is the requirement to break tolerance against zzso zzso a potentially risky procedure but necessary for several cancer zzso A study in this issue of the European Journal of zzso attempts to do this by using zzso zzso albeit with variable zzso The unstated goal is to activate zzso help but this can be achieved more effectively by harnessing a predictable zzso zzso The second issue lies in the delivery of zzso One strategy is zzso using DNA zzso and boosting with a viral zzso however, this zzso blocking immunity against viral zzso and must be used zzso There are other physical methods to increase immunity such as zzso which can itself be used in zzso zzso These twin problems of engagement of zzso help and delivery of adequate zzso can now be addressed by applying zzso logic to cancer zzso
