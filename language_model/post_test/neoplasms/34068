zzso of excessive zzso zzso generation have been indicated to be more effective antioxidants than radical zzso because zzso zzso is one of the precursors of several types of zzso oxygen species zzso We demonstrated here that zzso zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso generating a great amount of zzso in zzso zzso The exposure of zzso to the differentiated zzso cells resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso generation, while the zzso analog of zzso hardly zzso with zzso including zzso and protein zzso did not show any zzso zzso of the cells with zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso zzso while zzso with zzso zzso zzso These results led us to assume that a plausible zzso target zzso having a zzso zzso zzso might be regulated by the zzso attachment with zzso In spite of no ability to affect the zzso of protein zzso C beta to the zzso zzso probably zzso the electron transport system of zzso zzso consistent with the observation that zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of mouse skin with zzso significantly attenuated the zzso hydrogen zzso level, suggesting that zzso indeed acts as an inhibitor of zzso generation in mouse zzso A zzso study also demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Because we have found several zzso generation zzso to be effective zzso against mouse skin zzso the zzso effect of the topical application of zzso on zzso mouse skin tumor promotion was zzso We demonstrated for the first time that the zzso with zzso 40 zzso prior to each zzso treatment significantly inhibited the number of zzso per zzso In conclusion, the results from this study provided biological evidence that zzso has a potential to prevent zzso zzso including skin zzso
