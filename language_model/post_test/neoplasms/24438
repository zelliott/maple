During the past two to three decades there has been an exciting revolution in our understanding of the zzso zzso process and of the molecular zzso of zzso The general principle of zzso interactions is central to our understanding of cancer zzso The paradigm that persistent infections and chronic inflammation contributes via zzso and zzso zzso immune response to zzso becomes more and more attractive in cancer zzso Besides genetic factors, the zzso of impaired cell signaling and signal zzso by zzso zzso and zzso are important zzso of zzso The zzso of the nuclear factor zzso for example, a hallmark of inflammatory responses that is frequently detected in tumors, might constitute a missing link between inflammation and zzso It will be a challenge for future therapeutic and preventive cancer research to detect potential targets in chronic inflammatory disease which are essential links to promote zzso zzso
