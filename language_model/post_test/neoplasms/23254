Previous studies have suggested that schizophrenia is zzso with a reduced risk of zzso Genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation seem to have additional functions in zzso zzso involved in zzso migration and synaptic zzso zzso zzso play a dominant role in the regulation of gene expression in the central nervous system zzso Due to their involvement in a large number of zzso zzso zzso pose as appealing molecules for further investigation, with potential zzso zzso and therapeutic zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential association between cancer and schizophrenia in zzso sample zzso We analyzed a large number of zzso in a control group of 6 schizophrenic patients and a study group of 8 schizophrenic patients with a solid zzso A comparison between the control and study groups showed that only zzso was zzso zzso Specifically, a significant zzso of zzso in the samples of the study group was zzso Although a larger sample size is required to validate this result for the general patient population, our findings provide a first indication that zzso may play a role in regulating the expression of other genes with zzso zzso Our results are in agreement with the theory that patients with schizophrenia may have a tumor zzso gene or enhanced zzso zzso zzso Further studies are required in order to shed light on the role of zzso and particularly, on the zzso role of zzso in the zzso pathways involved in zzso
