The reverse transformation reaction zzso zzso cells are restored to a more normal zzso has been zzso The primary zzso action is ascribed to the zzso exposure reaction in which a peripheral nuclear DNA region is restored to high sensitivity to zzso I, like that in normal zzso Various aspects of zzso exposure around the zzso and the nuclear periphery are zzso The special role of the zzso in regulating exposure resulting in normal differentiation on the one hand and zzso transformation on the other is zzso The action of the zzso system for regulation of the zzso zzso previously proposed is reviewed in relation to normal differentiation and zzso with brief indication of roles played by various zzso zzso factors, zzso cell zzso and processes like specific zzso and zzso zzso implications for cancer therapy and prevention and for the fields of genetic disease and zzso are zzso
