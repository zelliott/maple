Emerging studies suggest that dietary components can affect gene expression through zzso zzso zzso modifications are zzso and potentially zzso changes in gene expression that do not require changes in the DNA zzso The main mechanisms of zzso control in zzso are DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The potential zzso of zzso changes suggests that they could be modulated by nutrition and zzso food zzso Thus, zzso modifications could mediate environmental signals and provide a link between zzso genes and environmental factors in the zzso of zzso zzso the impact of nutrition on zzso mechanisms may serve as a tool to predict an zzso zzso to cancer, provide dietary recommendations, or provide therapeutic applications of natural compounds against zzso The optimal duration and the dose necessary for a zzso effect require further zzso There is limited information about tissue specificity and zzso aspects of dietary zzso Species differences need to be considered when interpreting results from various zzso zzso molecular mechanisms of zzso dietary components should be investigated in greater detail in human intervention zzso Although some of these issues remain controversial, this review mainly focuses on promising data that support the developing field of zzso zzso
