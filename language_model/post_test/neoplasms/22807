The zzso syndrome is characterized by a state of zzso dysfunction resulting in the development of several chronic diseases that are potentially zzso These zzso zzso are complex and intertwined and it has been observed that many of the mechanisms and pathways responsible for diseases characterizing the zzso syndrome such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease are linked with cancer development as zzso Identification of molecular pathways common to these diverse diseases may prove to be a critical factor in disease prevention and development of potential targets for therapeutic zzso This review focuses on several molecular zzso including zzso zzso and zzso that zzso cancer development, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso and zzso are crucial regulators involved in the maintenance of key zzso processes necessary for proper zzso It is critical to recognize and identify common pathways zzso in interrelated diseases as it may provide further information and a much more global picture in regards to disease development and zzso Thus, this review focuses on three key zzso regulators, zzso zzso and zzso that may potentially serve as therapeutic zzso
