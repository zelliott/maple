In 2005, The National Institutes of Health zzso called upon the scientific community to identify the most intractable problems in science and medicine and describe how we would solve these problems using zzso 

Our group was one of 8 research communities awarded an zzso research consortium zzso zzso Using the infrastructure of this large, zzso grant and a team science approach, we set out to solve the problem of fertility loss in young female cancer zzso that was not easily zzso through other zzso 

The word zzso was coined specifically for the zzso to reflect the intimate partnership between zzso care and fertility care for these zzso disciplines that would no longer function at zzso zzso but as an integrated zzso zzso by the zzso funding zzso interdisciplinary teams worked together in unique ways to create a zzso to bedside to zzso zzso 

The grant has now ended, and zzso so have the most intractable parts of the original zzso As we look back on what worked and look forward to tackling the next set of zzso questions, we are confident that this very special zzso funding mechanism made a meaningful difference in the lives of women and their future zzso zzso and the public would be well-served by supporting clinical zzso multidisciplinary team science approaches to catalyze fundamental biomedical breakthroughs and create new intellectual environments in which changes in clinical practice and standard of care can be zzso
