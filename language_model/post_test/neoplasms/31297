The zzso of using claims data for measuring tumor stage, one of the most important zzso of choice of therapy and long-term survival, is zzso 

To determine the relative accuracy of both zzso and hospital zzso Medicare claims for measuring the stage of disease of six commonly diagnosed zzso 

Analysis of a database linking zzso zzso and End zzso zzso registry data and Medicare claims in patients aged 65 years with zzso 

Three hundred zzso zzso six hundred and thirty seven cases of invasive breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso diagnosed between 1984 and zzso 

Using zzso files as the zzso zzso zzso with Medicare claims, as well as sensitivity and positive zzso value of coding for each stage was zzso 

Although Medicare data correctly zzso local, zzso and distant stage tumors in zzso zzso and zzso respectively, the data substantially overestimated the proportion of localized tumors and underestimated the rate of regional stage zzso The highest zzso was observed for breast and zzso zzso However, the sensitivity and positive zzso values were never simultaneously zzso within one stage of a specific zzso The accuracy of coding for stage in zzso files was inferior to zzso zzso 

With few exceptions, Medicare claims have limited utility as a measure of cancer zzso If tumor registry data are not available, investigators should consider the trade zzso in sensitivity and zzso value when considering a study that will use claims zzso
