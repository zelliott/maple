Turner syndrome zzso affects more than 50,000 girls and women in the United zzso The National Cooperative Growth Study zzso has collected efficacy and safety data for zzso zzso children treated with zzso human zzso zzso during the last 20 zzso 

Our objective was to determine zzso of specific targeted adverse events zzso and additional zzso of interest in zzso zzso zzso safety data in zzso patients or normal populations were compared for selected zzso 

Patients may be enrolled at zzso initiation and followed until zzso Investigators submit zzso reports describing any event that is potentially zzso related or is a targeted zzso 

The zzso Drug Safety department received zzso zzso reports for zzso zzso patients as of June 30, 2006, including 117 serious zzso Seven deaths zzso five resulted from zzso zzso The zzso of certain events known to be associated with zzso zzso zzso including zzso hypertension, slipped capital zzso zzso zzso and zzso was increased compared with other zzso patients in zzso There were 10 zzso zzso that occurred, including six in patients without known risk zzso Type 1 diabetes also appeared to be increased compared with other zzso zzso 

Children with zzso who were treated with zzso exhibit an increased underlying risk for selected zzso associated with zzso and for type 1 diabetes, which is likely unrelated to zzso The zzso zzso zzso reflects the higher baseline risk for these events in zzso was consistent with current zzso data in smaller zzso zzso and is likely unrelated to zzso It is not known whether the reported zzso represent an inherently increased risk in zzso zzso Twenty years of experience in zzso patients indicates no new zzso safety signals in the zzso zzso The zzso and similar zzso although focused on the years during zzso treatment, may also be a window into the natural history of zzso in zzso
