zzso is a synthetic zzso 10 analog with zzso properties in various cell lines and tumor zzso The purpose of this phase I study was to evaluate the safety and zzso maximum tolerated dose, zzso and zzso clinical and zzso zzso activity of zzso when given as a zzso intravenous infusion every 3 weeks in patients with zzso solid zzso 

Patients had a zzso verified zzso tumor with measurable disease, were zzso or zzso 18 years old, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status zzso and adequate bone zzso liver, zzso and cardiac zzso zzso toxicity was defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso days, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso degrees C with grade 4 (National Cancer zzso toxicity zzso zzso or grade 3/4 zzso toxicity excluding zzso and zzso The last dose was the dose where zzso or zzso 2 out of six patients experienced zzso toxicity in cycle zzso The maximum tolerated dose was one dose level below with less than two of six patients with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso fully zzso patients were zzso The majority were male zzso and the median age was 55 years zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The median number of cycles was two zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in three patients at the zzso zzso dose level, including zzso fatigue and a short zzso zzso peripheral zzso zzso The most common zzso per patient were fatigue, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on zzso criteria, the best response was stable disease in seven zzso The zzso evaluation revealed a zzso of approximately 7 h and linear zzso 

The recommended dose of zzso for the zzso administration is zzso zzso zzso fatigue and a zzso peripheral zzso syndrome are zzso with this zzso zzso may be associated with neurological zzso in patients previously exposed to zzso compounds such as zzso
