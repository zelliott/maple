The zzso gene is the most frequently zzso gene in human zzso The identification of two zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso is a member of a family of related zzso zzso Given that they share zzso acid sequence identity reaching zzso in the zzso domain, zzso zzso and zzso should have redundant functions in the regulation of gene zzso Indeed, zzso can activate zzso genes and suppress growth or induce zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso are both induced by DNA damage - albeit through distinct zzso Other evidence, however, suggests that zzso and zzso are important for regulation of normal zzso An extended zzso region, not found in zzso is alternatively spliced in zzso and zzso Within this zzso extension is a sterile zzso motif zzso previously found in other proteins that regulate zzso The zzso mice showed zzso zzso Interestingly, the human zzso gene is zzso in children who have the disease zzso zzso zzso and facial zzso zzso syndrome, and the disease zzso is similar to the one of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are rarely zzso in human cancer, although zzso loss is observed in zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to have overlapping and distinct zzso zzso regulates the stress response to suppress zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso and zzso might regulate both the stress response and zzso Because zzso and zzso are linked to different upstream zzso this family of zzso factors might regulate a common set of genes in response to different zzso signals and zzso zzso
