An zzso prospective zzso clinical trial was performed to determine the effect of a drug-induced zzso zzso results on treatments planned by zzso 

zzso cancer cells from patient zzso were placed into the zzso zzso zzso zzso a short-term culture, which determined the effects of single drugs or combinations of drugs on tumor cell zzso An zzso received the zzso results before zzso the treatment zzso Use of the zzso zzso was evaluated and correlated with patient zzso 

zzso patients with successful zzso zzso from breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and others were zzso Four patients received zzso chemotherapy after zzso and 40 received zzso chemotherapy with a median line of therapy of zzso zzso used the zzso zzso to determine chemotherapy zzso in 28 zzso and did not zzso in 16 patients zzso In users receiving zzso chemotherapy, complete plus partial response rate was zzso compared with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The median overall survival was zzso months in users versus zzso months in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso months in users versus zzso months in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso results are frequently used by zzso Outcomes appear to be statistically superior when zzso use chemotherapy based on zzso zzso results compared with when they do not use the zzso zzso When available to zzso zzso zzso results help to determine patient treatment zzso
