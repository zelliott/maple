zzso zzso has shown some activity in zzso melanoma, but its use is severely limited by zzso zzso is a product in which the human zzso zzso was incorporated into the zzso of zzso cells, a monkey zzso cell zzso The goal of this zzso applied therapy was to create an zzso immune response zzso by zzso and local production of zzso in the close vicinity of zzso zzso zzso was reported to have a good safety profile in two previous zzso phase I studies performed in 18 patients with various solid tumors, with encouraging clinical responses in three zzso The objectives of this study were to evaluate the tolerance and zzso of tumor zzso in patients with zzso melanoma, following repeated administration of zzso zzso 

This was on zzso zzso phase II study comparing two doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso melanoma were enrolled in the study, 14 in each treatment zzso Patients received zzso by zzso injection on days 1, 3, and 5 every 4 weeks for four cycles, and every 8 weeks thereafter, until evidence of progressive disease zzso zzso for patient selection included zzso proven zzso melanoma, with one tumor accessible for product administration, and at least another tumor site for response zzso zzso included tumor zzso zzso and T zzso local and systemic immune response, zzso response to zzso cells, adverse events and standard laboratory zzso 

None of the patients achieved a confirmed objective zzso zzso disease zzso was seen in six zzso and eight patients zzso at the zzso and the zzso dose level, zzso Two patients, one in each group, died during the study zzso within 1 month after the last zzso due to zzso Three patients exhibited zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso levels and zzso zzso expression in tumor zzso did not show meaningful zzso after therapy, except for a trend toward an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso The study drug was well tolerated at both dose levels and side effects mainly consisted of injection site pain and zzso and zzso 

The zzso administration of zzso was generally well tolerated in patients with zzso melanoma, and transient disease stabilization was observed in 50% of zzso
