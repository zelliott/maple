Recent studies indicate that portions of zzso and tumor zzso are derived by zzso zzso bone zzso zzso circulating zzso zzso cells zzso home to sites of zzso or zzso growth and contribute to blood vessel zzso Recent data from animal models suggest that a variety of cell types, including zzso zzso zzso cells and those obtained by ex zzso expansion of human peripheral blood or enriched zzso can function as zzso to promote tissue zzso zzso and repair when introduced in zzso The promising zzso results have led to several human clinical trials using zzso as a potential source of zzso in cardiac repair as well as ongoing basic research on using zzso in tissue engineering or as cell therapy to target tumor zzso
