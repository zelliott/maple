In spite of the numerous reports indicating the presence of zzso zzso factors in cancer patients, only a few of these factors have been zzso zzso Furthermore, their role as effective zzso in zzso remains to be zzso Our laboratory has attempted to isolate and identify the major zzso factor in the zzso zzso derived from zzso and lung cancer zzso We have previously demonstrated that the Mr 52,000 zzso factor isolated from the zzso fluid of an zzso cancer patient inhibited zzso immune responses in zzso and in zzso including the zzso of zzso Thus, this zzso factor was named zzso zzso zzso Our current study demonstrates that this zzso factor zzso from zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso or head and neck cancer patients had a common component which zzso equally into Mr zzso and zzso zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso under vigorous reducing zzso zzso of these two components followed by a limited zzso acid sequence determination revealed these two components to have zzso zzso acid sequences identical to the beta and alpha 2 zzso of normal adult zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso zzso to zzso zzso blood demonstrated that zzso unlike normal zzso has slower zzso mobility than the normal adult zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso separated on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso under zzso conditions failed to recognize a zzso zzso directed specifically to zzso However, this zzso zzso exclusively reacted with the zzso separated by an zzso zzso gel zzso gel under zzso conditions while normal adult zzso or zzso but zzso zzso obtained from the same zzso fluid as zzso all failed to react with this zzso Thus, zzso appears to bear an additional zzso that is absent in normal adult zzso Since the zzso as well as the zzso zzso have at least 100 to zzso more potent zzso activity than the normal adult zzso this additional zzso present in zzso may be responsible for the potent zzso property of zzso
