The ability of cells to maintain zzso integrity is vital for cell survival and zzso Lack of zzso in DNA replication and maintenance can result in deleterious zzso leading to cell death or, in zzso organisms, zzso The purpose of this review is to discuss the known signal zzso pathways that regulate cell cycle progression and the mechanisms cells employ to insure DNA stability in the face of zzso zzso In particular, we focus on zzso cell cycle checkpoint functions, their role in maintaining DNA stability during the cell cycle following exposure to zzso agents, and the gene products that act in checkpoint function signal zzso zzso Key transitions in the cell cycle are regulated by the activities of various protein zzso complexes composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Surveillance control mechanisms that check to ensure proper completion of early events and cellular integrity before initiation of subsequent events in cell cycle progression are referred to as cell cycle checkpoints and can generate a transient delay that provides the cell more time to repair damage before progressing to the next phase of the zzso A variety of cellular responses are zzso that function in checkpoint signaling to inhibit zzso zzso These responses include the zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso molecules zzso zzso proper zzso zzso and zzso checkpoint responses to zzso DNA breaks requires the function of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Several human zzso zzso syndromes known to alter DNA stability have been found to have defects in checkpoint surveillance zzso zzso to several common sources of zzso stress, including zzso stress, zzso radiation, zzso radiation, and the zzso compound zzso elicit cell cycle checkpoint responses that show both similarities and differences in their molecular zzso
