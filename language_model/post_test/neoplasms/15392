zzso zzso zzso are zzso of zzso tumor zzso zzso have been demonstrated in experimental animals to induce protection against transplanted zzso tumors, when administered prior to the challenge with the zzso zzso were first introduced into clinical trials as a treatment adjunct to chemotherapy and zzso zzso zzso In recent years, beneficial clinical and biological activity responses have been observed in melanoma and zzso cancer zzso zzso after administration of zzso zzso Our group has continued clinical trials with zzso strain influenza zzso We have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso delayed type hypersensitivity in coded skin testing and have emphasized regional active zzso in treatment zzso The efficacy of active zzso strategies have yet to be zzso but recent findings in zzso and zzso zzso cancer highlight the importance of route and careful integration with other therapeutic zzso The zzso are zzso to trigger zzso mechanisms in the host that may ultimately lead to the control of the zzso spread and elimination of the zzso zzso immune responses induced by zzso have been zzso while cellular immune responses associated with zzso administration have been investigated to a lesser zzso We present here what is known and we discuss hypothesized mechanisms of zzso and T cell zzso immunity induced by zzso now under zzso The zzso of these mechanisms may provide conceptual advances in the field of human tumor immunity as well as a rationale for the development of tumor zzso
