This paper reviews the zzso aspects of zzso zzso with zzso zzso including comparisons between zzso and external beam zzso The effectiveness of cell killing by radiation decreases with the dose rate and the rate of decrease is determined by the size of the shoulder on the radiation survival zzso zzso with poor repair capabilities exhibit less of a dose rate effect than tumors with good repair zzso zzso tumor cell proliferation during treatment occurs at very low dose rates and can contribute to the reduced effectiveness of low dose rate zzso zzso to normal zzso will determine the total dose of zzso zzso that can be given and this will be influenced by the choice of both the zzso and the zzso The reported enhanced effectiveness of zzso may be due to multiple factors including selective targeting of cells responsible for tumor volume doubling, tumor surface binding rather than homogeneous binding throughout the tumor volume, targeting of the tumor zzso or block of cell cycle progression in zzso During zzso there is less time for zzso of hypoxic tumor cells than during a course of conventional external beam zzso It has not yet been determined whether this will have a zzso effect on zzso Probably the most important factor in the success of zzso is dose zzso Any viable portion of a tumor that is not targeted and does not receive a significant radiation dose will potentially lead to treatment failure, no matter how high the dose received by the remainder of the zzso Comparisons between zzso and external beam radiation have shown a wide range of relative zzso zzso most likely to respond to zzso are tumors with poor repair capabilities, tumors that are susceptible to zzso in zzso zzso of the cell cycle, tumors that zzso zzso and tumors that express the relevant zzso zzso From a zzso perspective, it appears that zzso alone is unlikely to cure many tumors and that combination with other treatment zzso will be zzso
