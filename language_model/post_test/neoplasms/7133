It is shown that a molecular origin for growth zzso is rather unlikely because the zzso area of zzso forces in a cell population cannot exceed more than about zzso zzso A model of the time dependence of cell number zzso where zzso is the time, is based on zzso and explains without any contradiction to known experimental results growth regulation in terms of the factor a zzso zzso which stimulates the cell division rate zzso and the factor b zzso zzso which zzso cell zzso It accounts for the total cell division rate zzso zzso zzso - zzso For adults, T is the zzso time of about zzso zzso corresponding to the longest lifetime of cell zzso in men, while zzso zzso zzso s zzso to the resolution time of the cell population which is always the average time zzso between two cell loss zzso Our model follows a zzso holistic approach to describing a cell population as an entity, regulated by a fully coherent zzso zzso
