Novel markers are needed to accurately predict the risk of zzso transformation in zzso zzso We therefore investigated the clinical significance of zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso and their potential utility as cancer risk zzso zzso and zzso protein expression and gene amplification were assessed in 82 patients with zzso zzso and correlated with zzso parameters and zzso cancer zzso Increased zzso and zzso expression was found respectively in 41 zzso and 40 zzso of 82 zzso zzso protein expression was maintained or further zzso in the corresponding zzso invasive tumors subsequently zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso were respectively detected in 10 zzso and 26 zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso protein expression increased with the grade of zzso however, zzso and zzso expression but not zzso correlated significantly with increased zzso cancer risk zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso Patients carrying strong zzso or zzso zzso zzso experienced a significantly higher cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was an independent predictor of zzso cancer development zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the combination of zzso and zzso showed superior zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Taken together, our findings support the involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso transformation and provide original evidence for their potential clinical utility as zzso for the risk of developing zzso zzso
