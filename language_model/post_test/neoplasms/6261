The zzso zzso is a complex network of zzso and zzso molecules that not only provide structure to the lung but also interact with and regulate the zzso of the cells which it zzso Recently it has been zzso that components of the zzso zzso proteins are released, often through the action of zzso zzso and these fragments are termed zzso zzso have biological activities, independent of their role within the zzso zzso structure, which may play important roles in the lung in health and disease zzso zzso are the primary cell surface zzso zzso to date, which are used by the zzso to exert their effects on zzso However, evidence is emerging for the need for zzso and other receptors for the zzso to exert their effects on zzso The potential for zzso and peptides derived from these zzso zzso protein fragments, as therapeutic agents has recently been zzso The natural role of these zzso (including zzso of zzso and possibly zzso make them ideal targets to mimic as zzso A number of these peptides have been taken forward into clinical zzso The focus of this review will be to zzso our current understanding of the role, and potential for highly relevant actions, of zzso in lung health and zzso
