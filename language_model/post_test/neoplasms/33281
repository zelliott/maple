Although zzso have been recognized as participants in zzso of tissue injury, the collateral role of zzso as reporters from the immune system identifying cellular participants in zzso has not been fully zzso The immune system appears to be capable of sensing zzso structure, distribution, and function of certain cellular components involved in zzso and making zzso responses to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso can report zzso transformation before standard clinical studies and may be useful as early detection zzso The zzso response also provides insights into factors related to how cellular components may be rendered zzso As diagnostic zzso specific zzso zzso for identifying zzso profiles could have sufficient sensitivity in zzso between types of zzso Such zzso profiles could also be used to monitor response to zzso The immune system of cancer patients reveals the immune interactive sites or the zzso of participants in zzso and this information should be used in the design of zzso
