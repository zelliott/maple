zzso cells of solid tumors are relatively resistant to therapeutic zzso Studies have demonstrated that zzso tumor cells exist in an environment conducive to reductive reactions making hypoxic cells particularly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso C, the zzso zzso zzso agent available for clinical use, is capable of zzso killing zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso This phenomenon is at least in part the result of differences in the zzso and metabolism of zzso C by hypoxic and zzso tumor cells, with the ultimate critical zzso being the zzso of DNA by the zzso zzso The combination of zzso C with zzso to attack hypoxic and zzso tumor cell zzso respectively, has led to enhanced zzso effects in mice bearing solid tumor implants and in patients with cancer of the head and zzso More zzso kill of hypoxic tumor cells may be possible by the use of zzso in combination with zzso or by the use of the related zzso zzso The findings support the use of an agent with specificity for hypoxic tumor cells in potentially zzso regimens for solid zzso
