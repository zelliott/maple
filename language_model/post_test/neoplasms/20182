Cancer development in man appeared to be a zzso process as suggested by zzso studies on commonly occurring zzso zzso and breast zzso and also on human zzso zzso and by the finding by physicians and surgeons of zzso zzso for many types of zzso In the last 10 years it has become evident that human zzso have multiple genetic zzso caused by point zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso The genes affected include both zzso and zzso genes and genes that accelerate cell proliferation and zzso zzso with more zzso properties and poorer prognosis are generally associated with larger numbers of genetic zzso These multiple genetic zzso are considered to be a direct reflection of the multiple steps involved in zzso The multiple genetic zzso are caused by multiple environmental zzso substances or factors, each of which usually exists only at minute zzso and does not exert any major impact alone except under particular zzso zzso and locally geographic zzso The fact that zzso is a zzso process involving multiple genetic zzso clearly needs to be taken into consideration in assessing the risks of environmental zzso substances or zzso The increasing zzso of multiple primary zzso is also most easily understood from the viewpoint of multiple steps in zzso zzso multiple approaches to cancer prevention should therefore be considered in relation to zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso
