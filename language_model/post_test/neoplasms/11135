zzso zzso zzso zzso remains a common problem in pediatric zzso and often leads to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso chest, abdomen, and zzso Little evidence is available as to the diagnostic utility of CT in this zzso 

We performed a retrospective review of all zzso patients admitted to the hospital from January 2004 through December 2008 for zzso who had daily zzso with zzso for 4 or more consecutive days prompting CT zzso zzso patient charts were reviewed for zzso prior to imaging as well as zzso and zzso regimens throughout zzso 

zzso patients had 68 unique episodes of prolonged zzso that resulted in CT zzso Positive findings occurred in zzso zzso and zzso of initial chest, abdomen, and zzso zzso zzso There were no positive findings on initial pelvic zzso Only two of the initial positive CT scans led to a change in management zzso of positive scans, zzso of all initial zzso These were both scans of the zzso All patients with concern for zzso zzso infection had findings on chest zzso Patients with clinically important infections had no statistical difference in days of fever or zzso or type of underlying zzso compared with those without zzso Clinical zzso was most helpful for zzso 

Treatment zzso rarely results from zzso CT imaging in the early days of prolonged zzso We therefore recommend limiting initial zzso CT imaging to the chest only in patients without zzso signs or symptoms and prolonged zzso
