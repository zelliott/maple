zzso blood vessels play important roles in tumor progression and zzso Thus, targeting tumor blood vessels is an important strategy for cancer zzso zzso zzso cells zzso are the main targets of zzso zzso Although tumor blood vessels generally zzso from pre-existing vessels and have been thought to be genetically normal, they display a markedly abnormal zzso including zzso zzso The degree of zzso is determined by the balance between the positive and negative regulating molecules that are released by tumor and host cells in the zzso zzso tumor blood vessels are zzso with zzso differing from normal zzso cells (in contrast to the conventional zzso We recently compared characteristics of different zzso isolated from highly and low zzso zzso We found zzso from highly zzso tumors had more zzso zzso than those from low zzso zzso zzso the variety of zzso zzso and identifying zzso molecular signatures should lead to more complete understanding of the mechanisms of tumor zzso discovery of new therapeutic targets, and development of zzso This review considers current studies on zzso zzso and discusses the therapeutic implications of these zzso
