Most cancer cells differ from normal cells in that they show higher zzso activity and lower pH of their zzso zzso drugs can be designed which take advantage of these zzso to deliver zzso toxicity to tumors and minimal toxicity to normal zzso Many design criteria are suggested here, the most basic of which is the use of the zzso structure, in which zzso acid acts as a protective carrier of a toxic zzso which becomes active when split off by the zzso at the tumor zzso The high zzso activity in cancer cells is also discussed here as a possible explanation for some of the zzso features of a zzso zzso the automatic proliferation of tumor zzso the invasion of tumors into adjacent zzso the zzso to remote sites, and the weak response of the immune zzso
