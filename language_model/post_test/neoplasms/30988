zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso or zzso have been shown to produce extensive DNA damage in zzso cell systems in zzso Such zzso are zzso agents that are taken up by zzso dividing cells in the S phase of the cell zzso The degree of damage that occurs is related to the fact that these zzso bind zzso to DNA bringing the zzso zzso zzso in close proximity to the zzso The use of these zzso zzso in zzso is associated with several zzso The first relates to their extremely short zzso zzso in blood zzso of minutes in zzso The second involves achieving therapeutic ratios in tumor cells in the face of efficient zzso zzso The third concerns the zzso of these zzso by actively zzso normal cell renewal systems, thus potentially causing toxic side zzso The fourth, one shared with other zzso drugs, relates to the matter of labeling the whole tumor cell zzso To facilitate targeting to tumors, investigators have been examining the direct introduction of these agents into the targeted area or into an zzso blood supply that immediately precedes the zzso For example, zzso administration could be zzso zzso spinal fluid, zzso zzso zzso zzso breast zzso or zzso zzso zzso In all these situations, the following conditions must be zzso zzso once within the vicinity of the tumor the agent can freely diffuse through the zzso and is selectively taken up by zzso zzso zzso once the agent has left the target area it is converted quickly into a nontoxic form and/or zzso from the zzso and finally, zzso the zzso behavior of the agent is not altered by repeated zzso We report zzso our experience and that of others with zzso in cultured cells, animal zzso systems, and zzso In zzso DNA incorporation of zzso and zzso zzso leads to an exponential decrease in cell survival (no shoulder on the survival zzso However, the total number of zzso needed to produce a given lethal effect with zzso is approximately twice that required with zzso In zzso the zzso and zzso capabilities of zzso zzso have been demonstrated in an zzso zzso zzso tumor model following zzso zzso in an zzso rat zzso model after zzso zzso in an zzso rat zzso model after zzso zzso and in a rat transitional cell zzso cancer model following zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso have been administered to patients with brain, breast, zzso or gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso liver zzso from zzso cancer (through the zzso artery, permanent zzso zzso These studies have confirmed the observations made in animal zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso with an zzso electron zzso zzso or zzso may be a useful agent for the zzso diagnosis and/or therapy of zzso diseases that are accessible to direct zzso zzso This zzso should serve as a zzso for, and facilitate the development of, other zzso zzso zzso Further investigations are certainly zzso
