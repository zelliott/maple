Human tumors frequently have defects in the maintenance of zzso integrity, which involve a loss of the appropriate response to DNA zzso These pathways of zzso integrity include key proteins involved in cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso In this review, we discuss opportunities for therapeutic intervention by exploiting these zzso with an emphasis on those processes which are primarily associated with the repair of zzso zzso As these defects are specific to tumor cells, the development of new zzso agents targeting these pathways may have an enhanced therapeutic window, with limited normal tissue zzso
