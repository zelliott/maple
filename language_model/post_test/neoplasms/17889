I propose an alternative model of cancer in which zzso need not all arise out of spread from the zzso zzso The model assumes that cancer cells arise from stem cells that best grow in the organ of their zzso When the internal milieu allows it they also grow at other sites as well, thus zzso the conventional zzso zzso zzso Several phenomena in the natural history of cancer, especially breast cancer, that challenge the conventional model, fit well after inclusion of the new zzso These are zzso a very modest benefit of screening zzso frequent sparing of lungs from zzso zzso zzso presence of zzso zzso in autopsy studies zzso only a modest effect of local treatment zzso relative ineffectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy zzso constant time between surgery and peak of hazard of zzso irrespective of stage of the zzso All these phenomena are much easier to explain when one rejects the dogma that all zzso arise only from the primary zzso This paper is aimed only to suggest an alternative perspective of natural history of solid zzso stimulate research on the complex internal milieu that allows cancer cells to develop in new zzso
