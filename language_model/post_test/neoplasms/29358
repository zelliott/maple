To study the association between proximity to air polluting industrial facilities and mortality in the zzso Country zzso in the zzso zzso 

A zzso ecological study with 1465 census sections zzso as units of analysis with a mean population of zzso zzso Association of zzso mortality with proximity of industries of the European zzso zzso Register was studied by type of industrial activity and adjusted for social zzso Two distance thresholds (1 zzso and 2 zzso were used as proxies for exposure in a zzso versus zzso zzso zzso of mortality studied were: all zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso zzso zzso heart zzso cerebrovascular diseases; chronic diseases of the lower respiratory zzso and breast cancer (in zzso zzso zzso linear mixed models zzso with two random effects zzso and structured spatial zzso were used in a fully zzso zzso 

Men living in sections within 1 zzso from energy production industries had greater mortality from zzso zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso to zzso as compared with people living zzso Women had greater mortality from zzso heart disease zzso zzso to zzso and respiratory illness zzso zzso to zzso within 2 zzso from zzso zzso On the contrary, within the 1 zzso buffer from mineral industries, mortality was lower for all causes zzso zzso to zzso and for zzso heart disease zzso zzso to zzso in women, and from respiratory diseases in men zzso zzso to zzso while it was greater for breast cancer in women zzso zzso to zzso within the 2 zzso zzso 

Analysis of mortality by census sections is a helpful exploratory tool for investigating environmental risk factors and directing actions to sites and risk factors with a greater impact on zzso Further zzso and environmental investigations around zzso and zzso plants are zzso
