We have found that the synthetic compound zzso zzso zzso cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso by a novel combination of molecular zzso zzso zzso proliferation of cancer cell lines from various zzso and zzso at zzso zzso Its zzso value ranges from zzso to 50 zzso The effect of zzso on cell growth is associated with cell cycle arrest in zzso phase, increased zzso of zzso checkpoint zzso and zzso zzso prevents zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso and zzso zzso in cultured cancer zzso In competitive binding zzso zzso competes with zzso for binding to zzso however, it does not compete with zzso zzso or zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso cancer cell growth with a mechanism of action similar to that of other zzso zzso However, zzso remains active against zzso cancer cells unlike other zzso drugs, such as zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso also zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso from zzso human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso zzso This zzso effect on zzso production is related to its zzso of zzso type 4 zzso zzso Moreover, in a mouse zzso model using zzso human zzso tumor cells, zzso significantly zzso tumor growth in zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that zzso represents a new zzso with novel mechanisms of action and that it has the potential to be developed for zzso and inflammatory disease zzso
