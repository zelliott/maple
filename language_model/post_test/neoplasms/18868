: This study aimed to evaluate different shortcuts of Healthcare Failure zzso and zzso Analysis zzso in a zzso zzso 

: A 2 zzso 2 study design was set up, in which 4 similar groups analyzed separately the possible risks of the same process by using different versions of zzso 

: In the zzso zzso Oncology clinic, a zzso institute in the Netherlands, treatment of cancer patients is organized within 3 different units, each focusing on a specific area zzso abdomen, and zzso The institute plans to treat all radiation areas in one generalized unit zzso 

: All 4 teams were composed of 3 radiation technologists (1 from each working zzso 1 manager radiation zzso and 1 zzso 

: Prospective risk analyses were completed in parallel within 1 zzso 

: Time investment and cost data on the different steps of the zzso were registered from the zzso zzso Each team suggested a number of corrective actions for the zzso The quality and feasibility of the proposed actions were assessed by an expert panel zzso and safety zzso 

: The zzso analyses resulted in direct costs varying from zzso to zzso zzso In total, the expert panel assessed 86 corrective actions, of which 43 zzso were relevant to implement before the start of the zzso Many of these actions related to the compliance, control, and education of standard operating procedures in daily practice of zzso 

: On the basis of the results of this case study, it seems feasible to develop less zzso and zzso versions of zzso which would increase even more the added value of prospective risk analysis tools for health care zzso
