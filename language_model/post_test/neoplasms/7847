zzso nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation parameters zzso zzso were measured for over 100 zzso and normal tissue samples of various zzso of the human zzso The purpose of this study was to estimate the reliability of the zzso technique in discriminating normal from zzso zzso Breast and zzso samples were analyzed by using the zzso index concept and we were able to distinguish zzso and normal tissue in 17 out of 18 breast samples and 5 out of 7 zzso zzso Since the relaxation data of a normal control population of the other zzso were not available, the data for these are reported without any further zzso The distinction between zzso and zzso was also made by using the estimated relaxation zzso zzso zzso of breast tissue samples for linear zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso procedures were calculated and used to evaluate the relative efficiencies in discriminating zzso from normal zzso
