zzso agents zzso are intended to restore or zzso a faltering immune zzso zzso was the first chemically defined zzso endowed with zzso zzso In order to clarify the mechanisms of its ambivalent activities, zzso were tested for their ability to modify immune zzso All zzso are zzso drugs which zzso effectiveness is related with the zzso influence of the zzso zzso The findings suggest also a relationship among zzso between chemical structure and influence on the immune zzso These studies lead to the development of sodium zzso zzso as a zzso zzso agent, specifically active on the zzso zzso Our studies unequivocally put forth on the specific requirements that are essential to characterize a potential zzso prior to clinical zzso in zzso activities no zzso through prolonged administration no zzso or zzso activity no zzso or zzso influence experimental route of administration related to that in humans zzso in various animal strains zzso chemical characterization known zzso zzso and zzso zzso on models of cancer, zzso diseases, zzso and zzso The results will allow to determine a range of doses, and predict most direct and secondary zzso They will also specify whether the agent is an zzso a zzso an zzso an zzso an zzso or an zzso zzso zzso will therefore be provided with the data which are essential to perform useful clinical zzso
