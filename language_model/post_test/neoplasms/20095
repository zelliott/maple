A statistical method for zzso clinical toxicity was used to determine a theoretical zzso zzso factor for dogs with zzso or zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was administered every 3 weeks with vigorous saline zzso to 54 dogs zzso alone zzso zzso 21, zzso zzso zzso zzso that were eligible for entry into this zzso zzso zzso was administered during the plateau phase of zzso in dogs receiving combined zzso Acute toxicity included zzso zzso zzso zzso 7; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso 1) and respiratory distress zzso zzso zzso zzso Eight dogs experienced chronic zzso dysfunction as a result of zzso zzso zzso 2) or zzso zzso zzso zzso A theoretical zzso zzso factor was determined for both acute and cumulative toxicity by comparing the maximum tolerated dose of each treatment zzso The maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso was defined as that dose producing a 50% zzso of moderate acute toxicity or acute plus mild chronic toxicity as estimated from zzso zzso analysis of the toxicity zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for acute toxicity only was zzso zzso zzso and for zzso alone the zzso was zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso factor for acute toxicity was zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso for cumulative toxicity zzso plus chronic zzso was zzso zzso zzso and for zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor for total cumulative toxicity was zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
