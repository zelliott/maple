This study demonstrates that short term incubation of blood zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso enhances their natural killer zzso but not their zzso dependent killer zzso activity, and confirms that zzso stimulation is not related to zzso zzso were obtained from healthy donors and incubated with zzso zzso supplemented with various serum zzso zzso and K activity of incubated zzso fresh zzso against zzso Chang or zzso cell line targets were compared in a zzso zzso release zzso A significant zzso less zzso increase in zzso zzso was detected when zzso were incubated with fetal calf serum zzso or human AB serum zzso at 37 degrees zzso When a more sensitive zzso target cell zzso was used only the cells incubated in zzso demonstrated increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell activity by zzso was not related to zzso zzso natural zzso against zzso or target cells, zzso complexes or zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso activity, K zzso was not increased after incubation at 37 degrees C in zzso or zzso and it was depressed in zzso zzso less than zzso Thus zzso is capable of stimulating zzso cell activity against human tumor cell lines in less in less than 24 zzso
