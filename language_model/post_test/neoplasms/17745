In zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso is the principal site for the folding and maturation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso are affected by various zzso and zzso zzso which include zzso of zzso reduction of zzso bonds, calcium depletion from the zzso zzso impairment of protein transport to the zzso and expression of zzso proteins in the zzso Under zzso stress, zzso proteins accumulate in the zzso zzso which zzso conflicting cellular activities: survival and zzso To cope with this stress, cells activate zzso zzso zzso such as the unfolded protein response zzso and the zzso degradation zzso However, under conditions of severe zzso stress or when the zzso has been compromised, the cell may be incapable of maintaining zzso zzso which may eventually activate programmed cell death zzso zzso Clinical data support the potential of drugs that inhibit the normal functions and zzso of the zzso and the zzso in treatment of zzso like zzso It is therefore reasonable to assume that manipulation of zzso stress might enhance the efficacy of zzso drugs and provide new zzso targets like the zzso and the zzso
