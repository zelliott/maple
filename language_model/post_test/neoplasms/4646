The need to allow for zzso factors when designing and zzso cancer trials is well zzso but the possibility of zzso should be avoided by restricting the number of zzso The proposed method improves on existing guidance by being based on explicit principles and being more adaptable to circumstances, and should be of particular use to clinicians when designing a zzso 

Given a proposed sample size, a minimum allowable number in a stratum and an acceptable risk of observing fewer than this zzso the number of strata can then be obtained by assuming a zzso distribution for the number of observations per zzso This can easily be programmed into zzso 

An example is given for a hypothetical typical trial of 250 patients, which for zzso power and zzso zzso significance would zzso to a Cohen's effect size of zzso (about halfway between the zzso and zzso zzso To have a zzso risk of fewer than 10 patients in a zzso no zzso strata should be zzso For a survival analysis with the same overall sample size but 170 deaths, no zzso strata would be zzso In the context of a cancer trial this could easily be met by only two zzso zzso 

The method proposed is flexible and based on explicit principles and may be applied in the design or analysis of both clinical trials and zzso zzso
