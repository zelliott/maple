zzso resonance imaging zzso is preferred for imaging the central nervous system zzso An important hazard for zzso patients is heating at the zzso interface zzso for example, by zzso zzso zzso magnetic fields of a zzso zzso 

We performed studies to define the zzso dose zzso and zzso that would not cause symptomatic neurological zzso 

zzso included animal studies where leads with temperature zzso were implanted in the brain or spine of sheep and exposed to zzso temperatures of 37 zzso to 49 zzso for 30 zzso zzso examinations were performed 7 days after zzso We also reviewed the threshold for zzso zzso in the zzso and for zzso injury from cancer zzso zzso equivalent minutes at 43 zzso was used to zzso the data to exposure times and temperatures expected during zzso 

Deep brain and spinal zzso heating up to 43 zzso for 30 minutes produced indistinguishable effects compared with 37 zzso zzso zzso greater than 43 zzso for 30 minutes produced zzso localized zzso zzso These results are consistent with limits on zzso exposure to zzso zzso for 60 minutes in patients who have cancer and with the zzso of zzso and zzso trial heating during zzso zzso zzso 

A safe temperature for induced lead heating is 43 zzso for 30 zzso zzso zzso heating above 43 zzso or longer than 30 minutes may be associated with increased risk of clinically evident zzso damage to neural structures immediately surrounding implanted zzso The establishment of a zzso dose limit is a first step toward making specific zzso systems zzso safe during zzso zzso
