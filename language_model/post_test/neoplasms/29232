Little research has been conducted on the effect of zzso rating of symptom severity on quality of life zzso among cancer zzso The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of symptoms and whether information about zzso symptom severity adds value to zzso zzso 

A questionnaire including the zzso zzso and an zzso derived symptom zzso was completed by 2 zzso cancer survivors participating in a rehabilitation program at baseline and at 1, 6 and 12 months' zzso We used zzso linear zzso models to evaluate the association between zzso and the zzso variables for perceived symptom severity zzso zzso zzso and cancer stage zzso zzso zzso with adjustment for age, zzso education and time since zzso 

Of the 2 zzso participants who reported having one or more symptoms, 1 zzso zzso considered the reported symptom to be zzso This zzso had significantly poorer zzso at baseline for all sites, ranging from zzso to zzso compared to those who did not regard their symptom as zzso zzso lower baseline levels on all functional zzso were seen for all sites in association with high perceived symptom severity zzso from zzso to zzso (physical zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso The impairment of physical, social, zzso and cognitive functioning persisted through 12 months for participants with cancer of the breast, lung and those with zzso although not all reached zzso 

Cancer survivors, irrespective of cancer site, experience a high burden of zzso zzso monitoring and assessment of symptoms and careful scrutiny of cancer zzso perceptions of how symptoms affect their lives is critical for clinical identification of patients who might benefit from enhanced medical attention and may be an important supplement to zzso zzso
