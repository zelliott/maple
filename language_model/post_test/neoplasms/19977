zzso evidence suggests a link between patients' zzso and zzso side zzso However, it remains unclear whether asking patients about their zzso might actually increase side zzso 

The present study tested whether questioning first-time chemotherapy patients about their zzso zzso for four common side effects influences the occurrence and/or severity of these side effects zzso and whether these zzso zzso are zzso of zzso side zzso 

zzso first-time chemotherapy patients were randomly allocated to have their zzso for zzso fatigue, feelings of sadness, and loss of appetite assessed before their first infusion or to no such zzso All patients then rated the occurrence and severity of these side effects at the end of their first chemotherapy zzso 

There were no statistically significant differences in occurrence or severity of side effects in those who had their zzso assessed compared with those who did zzso There was, however, evidence of a statistically significant positive relationship between patients' zzso zzso and their zzso reports of zzso loss of zzso and feelings of sadness, after controlling for age, sex, and baseline symptom zzso 

These findings suggest that patient zzso might be a useful point of intervention for attempting to reduce the burden of zzso side effects, as there do not appear to be any zzso effects of asking patients to report their zzso and their zzso do appear related to the occurrence of zzso side zzso
