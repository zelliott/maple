zzso of demand has shown substantial zzso of zzso in the zzso We used national audit data to study geographical differences in zzso waiting times, access and dose zzso across the four countries of the UK and between English strategic health zzso 

We used a zzso tool to collect data on diagnosis, dose zzso and waiting times on all National Health Service patients in the UK starting a course of zzso in the week zzso 24 September zzso Cancer zzso for the four countries of the UK and for England by primary care trust was used to model demand for zzso zzso by country and by strategic health zzso 

Across the zzso excluding skin cancer, zzso patients were prescribed 33 zzso zzso in the audit zzso Waits for radical zzso exceeded the recommended 4 week maximum for zzso of patients zzso zzso zzso per million per year ranged from 17 zzso to 36 zzso and radical zzso per incident cancer ranged from zzso to zzso Patients who were treated received similar treatment in terms of zzso per radical course of zzso zzso Access rates ranged from zzso to zzso nearing the zzso optimum of zzso in three zzso zzso per million prescribed as a first course of treatment varied from zzso to zzso of zzso zzso The percentage of patients failing to meet the 4 week Joint Council for Clinical Oncology target for radical zzso rose as activity rates increased zzso indicating a mismatch of demand and zzso In England, a comparison between strategic health authorities showed that increasing deprivation was correlated with lower rates of access to zzso zzso 

There are substantial differences across the UK in the zzso provided to patients and its zzso zzso capacity does not reflect regional variations in cancer zzso across the UK zzso cases per million per zzso In addition, deprivation is a major zzso influence on zzso access zzso In regions with higher levels of zzso fewer patients with cancer receive zzso and the proportion treated radically is zzso This probably reflects late presentation with advanced disease, poor performance status and zzso zzso To provide an zzso evidence-based service, the needs of the local population should be assessed using demand zzso based on local cancer zzso zzso this should include data on zzso performance status and stage at zzso The results should be compared with local zzso activity data to understand zzso access and dose zzso in order to plan adequate provision for the zzso The development of a mandatory zzso data set in England will facilitate this, but to assist change it is essential that the results are zzso and fed back to clinicians and zzso
