We present an image zzso zzso for small zzso zzso consisting of zzso cells that are evenly distributed and arranged in parallel at the zzso Making use of the properties of the chain distribution of the zzso cells, directional zzso zzso linear filters with different zzso were designed to enhance the rims of the zzso zzso zzso are based on the combined responses of the multiple zzso directional zzso linear zzso For zzso zzso of combined directional filters are shown along with those of the comparable zzso zzso zzso zzso results of small zzso zzso of both normal and cancer cases are zzso
