A large number of targeted zzso drugs are currently under development and most of them will have a companion diagnostic linked to their zzso If a diagnostic zzso is developed in conjunction with a targeted zzso drug, such an zzso will later end up determining the conditions for the use of the drug after its zzso The zzso then becomes a kind of zzso in relation to which patients should be treated with the drug in zzso This zzso role implies that companion diagnostic zzso must live up to the same regulatory standards and requirements known from drug zzso The zzso must have proven to be zzso robust and reliable and to have demonstrated clinical utility before they are routinely used in the zzso In the zzso zzso model, several zzso study designs have been used to demonstrate clinical zzso However, if we are to benefit from the increasing knowledge provided by molecular zzso new ways should be developed to demonstrate the clinical utility of zzso zzso The development of such an approach will require a rethinking at different levels and is likely to include a number of ethical, regulatory and practical zzso
