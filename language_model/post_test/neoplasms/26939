We determined whether any individual zzso are increased or decreased in a cohort of zzso patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso followed for up to 32 years at the University College London zzso Lupus zzso looking for any associated clinical or zzso factors and the prognosis after cancer zzso 

We undertook a careful retrospective review of the medical records and identified all individuals diagnosed with zzso For controls, we selected three other patients in the cohort who had not developed cancer, carefully matched for age, sex, ethnicity and disease zzso to determine if any obvious differences emerged in a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients developed cancer after being diagnosed with zzso There was a statistically insignificant small increase in overall cancer risk, standardized zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso for zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso and reduction in breast cancer zzso zzso and musculoskeletal manifestations, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to be positively associated with cancer risk in zzso zzso There was no drug, dose or duration was associated with cancer zzso There was a reduction in survival with a cancer fatality rate of zzso zzso 

We found a very small but statistically insignificant increased cancer risk with reduction in zzso Whereas some zzso appear to be more common in zzso notably prostate and cervical cancer, others, particularly breast cancer, are less zzso Multiple clinical and zzso factors are involved in the increased risk of zzso in zzso No drug dose or duration effect was zzso
