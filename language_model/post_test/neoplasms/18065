zzso of protein zzso C zzso activity in transformed cells and tumor cells containing activated zzso results in zzso To investigate the zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso we first identified the specific zzso zzso necessary to prevent zzso in the presence of activated zzso zzso zzso of zzso short interfering zzso zzso and zzso zzso chemical zzso directed against the zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Ras zzso pathway, increased the levels of zzso protein and activity in cells, whereas zzso of zzso activity decreased the expression of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso survival zzso by zzso Ras required zzso zzso zzso activity was dramatically decreased after zzso suppression in cells containing activated zzso zzso zzso activated zzso rescued cells from zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso through its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and that this increase in zzso activity, acting through zzso is required for cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso responsible for the initiation of the zzso signal after suppression of zzso activity was also determined to be zzso zzso zzso where AA is zzso zzso zzso was sufficient for induction of zzso after zzso zzso Thus, the same zzso zzso zzso is responsible for delivering both a zzso signal and a survival zzso the latter being zzso by zzso and zzso Selective suppression of zzso activity and zzso induction of zzso is a potential strategy for targeting of tumor cells containing an activated zzso
