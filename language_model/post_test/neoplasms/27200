The efficacy of zzso an irreversible zzso Family Blocker, was evaluated in patients who had 1 of 4 categories of solid tumors with zzso growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso gene amplification or zzso zzso 

Patients with previously treated but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso harboring zzso gene amplification or high zzso were identified by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were also screened for zzso zzso The primary zzso was the objective response zzso secondary zzso included the clinical benefit rate, zzso and zzso 

Of 385 zzso patients, 38 had zzso tumors (10 with zzso amplification and 29 with zzso amplification or high zzso zzso tumor had zzso high zzso none had zzso zzso and 20 patients received treatment with zzso 50 zzso zzso The objective response rate was zzso (1 of 20 zzso and the best objective response included 1 complete zzso Eight patients experienced stable zzso The most frequently reported adverse events were zzso zzso and decreased zzso The trial closed early because of slow zzso 

zzso zzso activity was zzso yet encouraging, in selected tumors that were screened zzso for target zzso The zzso of a zzso approach using a zzso zzso for patient selection across multiple tumor types can be zzso
