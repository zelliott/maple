Thirteen patients zzso in the control group developed cancer, whereas 15 patients in the zzso group zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 patients in the zzso group zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso developed zzso 

zzso appears to present no increased risk of zzso The zzso of cancer was slightly higher in the patients receiving zzso than in those not being treated with a calcium zzso which is consistent with earlier zzso however, this increase was not statistically zzso
