To determine if zzso zzso correction zzso zzso zzso 1) provides images with acceptable zzso definition and noise compared with zzso zzso and 2) provides acceptable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on 78 zzso zzso patients underwent zzso with tube current based on a standard zzso zzso A second group of 35 patients underwent zzso with tube current based on a zzso zzso zzso In a blinded review, two zzso rated each examination for zzso definition and image noise at 4 major zzso levels using a zzso zzso To evaluate for correct zzso zzso zzso zzso correction at the standard and reduced radiation doses on zzso water phantom studies using both imaging techniques were performed and zzso 

Patients who underwent zzso zzso received a mean zzso reduction in radiation dose compared with those who underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated statistically significant poorer ratings for zzso detail and noise at each of the 4 zzso levels zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso were graded acceptable for diagnostic interpretation if scores for image noise and zzso definition were greater than 3 at all zzso zzso There was a significant difference between the number of acceptable diagnostic scans in the zzso group zzso compared with the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no statistical difference in zzso correction values in zzso and zzso zzso correction maps of the water zzso 

zzso zzso significantly reduced the effective dose while providing optimal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, because of decreased image quality, zzso zzso was not acceptable for diagnostic zzso
