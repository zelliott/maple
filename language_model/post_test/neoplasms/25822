To develop models of human cancer we have expressed the avian zzso zzso zzso under a variety of zzso promoters in transgenic mice, thus rendering mice susceptible to infection with avian zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso gene transfer offers advantages over current zzso models of human zzso A single transgenic mouse line can be used to evaluate multiple genetic zzso individually and in zzso Furthermore, zzso genes are introduced zzso into animals, as occurs in the majority of naturally occurring zzso Because the avian viral zzso replicate only in avian cells, the viral zzso in infected transgenic mouse cells remains available for multiple rounds of infection with different zzso zzso We discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of using zzso avian zzso with zzso transgenic mice to generate cancer zzso
