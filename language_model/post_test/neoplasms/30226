In the past, we identified and cloned the zzso 12 zzso zzso a novel member of the zzso family, which is implicated in various zzso The classical zzso protein zzso contains a highly zzso zzso domain, a zzso zzso and a zzso region, and is involved in zzso Most members of this zzso family are subjected to alternative zzso thus generating multiple protein zzso with distinct properties, and sometimes even with opposite function zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we report the zzso molecular zzso and expression pattern of novel zzso zzso of the human zzso gene in cancer cell zzso zzso clones displaying high sequence identity zzso with the classical zzso transcript were zzso in order to identify those containing at least one novel zzso zzso zzso database mining led to the identification of three previously unknown zzso zzso of this zzso zzso In our effort to zzso validate these novel zzso we also cloned seven more, previously unidentified, zzso alternatively spliced zzso zzso analysis of all zzso zzso zzso in human cancer cell lines and embryonic kidney cells revealed remarkable differences between their zzso expression zzso Interestingly, 7 out of 10 novel zzso zzso of zzso are predicted to zzso new protein zzso some of which are zzso zzso in contrast to the classical zzso zzso which also contains a functional zzso zzso The remaining three novel zzso zzso of zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
