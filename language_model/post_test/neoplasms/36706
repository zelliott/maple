The application of zzso criteria to the examination of zzso zzso allows the reliable diagnosis of zzso in the majority of zzso One feature observed in tissue fragments previously thought to be indicative of zzso origin is the presence of zzso windows, presumably due to long surface zzso In this study, however, we examined zzso preparations of 143 zzso and zzso washing specimens and noted distinct zzso window formation within tissue fragments of zzso in zzso of the cases zzso zzso for zzso zzso blue with zzso zzso and periodic zzso following zzso zzso on corresponding cell block material demonstrated that zzso zzso contributes to such window formation in greater than half of these zzso Thus the presence of zzso windows within tissue fragments does not, in isolation, zzso the diagnosis of zzso in zzso zzso
