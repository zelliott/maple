Human zzso natural killer T zzso cells are a distinct zzso zzso subset specifically and zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso presented by zzso on zzso zzso zzso models show that zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso effective zzso immune responses and potentially important secondary immune effects, including zzso of conventional T cells and zzso zzso We describe the first clinical trial of cancer immune therapy with zzso zzso zzso zzso The results show that this therapy has substantial, zzso and highly zzso specific effects on zzso zzso cells and provide the first human in zzso evidence that zzso zzso cell stimulation leads to zzso of both innate and acquired zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso numbers and increased serum zzso We present the first clinical evidence that zzso zzso cell memory produces faster, more vigorous secondary immune responses by innate and acquired immunity upon zzso
