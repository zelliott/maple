To determine quality and duration of zzso survival zzso time in dogs with zzso tumors after definitive zzso zzso and to analyze zzso factors for zzso time and patterns of treatment zzso 

Prospective clinical zzso 

47 dogs with zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Dogs were treated with 48 zzso over 4 weeks on an zzso schedule of 4 zzso zzso analysis was done by use of Cox's zzso hazards zzso model to determine zzso factors for zzso zzso 

The only independent zzso factor for zzso time was tumor T zzso zzso of local tumor recurrence zzso vs infield zzso was independent of clinical stage, tumor location, and zzso In zzso of the dogs, severe acute radiation reactions in the final week of treatment resulted in treatment zzso In zzso of the dogs, chronic radiation reactions included bone zzso 

zzso was a safe and effective treatment of small zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The usefulness of the radiation protocol in this study is limited in dogs with large zzso tumors, particularly those located in the zzso half of the oral zzso because of poor results and high risk of acute radiation zzso
