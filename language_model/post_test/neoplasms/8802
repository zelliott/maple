This paper describes an associated analysis method of DNA zzso for the detection of cancer using an zzso amplifying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA is zzso by zzso restriction zzso followed by zzso amplification to incorporate zzso zzso Only zzso DNA can be amplified by zzso and the zzso level is detected through zzso resonance energy transfer zzso between zzso and zzso that is incorporated into the zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso promoters of 35 zzso cancer samples and 11 normal samples were zzso In accordance with the degree of zzso levels, they are clustered to three sections and assigned a zzso Through an associated analysis, we acquired a threshold for cancer detection with a sensitivity of zzso The zzso takes about 20 h to obtain the detection results and shows great potential as a useful tool for diagnostic and screening of zzso
