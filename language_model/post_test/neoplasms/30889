zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso in zzso oven workers were estimated in order to detect early biological effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured in 30 zzso oven workers zzso I) zzso exposed to very high zzso of zzso and zzso zzso One of the control groups zzso zzso consisted of 64 inhabitants of a highly zzso city whereas the second one comprised 35 persons living in a relatively unpolluted region zzso zzso Mean serum levels of zzso and zzso in group I were significantly higher than in the control zzso Furthermore, mean zzso level was significantly higher in group II than in group zzso zzso zzso only in a few cases exceeded the threshold of zzso The effect of tobacco smoking was revealed only in the control zzso No correlation was found between the exposure time and the examined zzso marker zzso It is supposed that the obtained results were the consequence of enhanced expression of genes responsible for the markers zzso initiation of early stage of zzso and were due to long-term exposure to zzso zzso
