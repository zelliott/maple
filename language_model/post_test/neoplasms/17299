Although tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown efficacy in a phase 2 clinical trial, development of resistance to TRAIL by tumor cells is a major zzso We investigated whether zzso a zzso zzso can sensitize human tumor cells to zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso The zzso induced expression of death zzso zzso 5 and zzso but did not affect expression of decoy receptors in cancer zzso The induction of zzso was zzso through zzso of zzso and through zzso of a zzso factor zzso zzso protein zzso protein zzso as zzso of these signaling molecules zzso the effect of zzso These effects of zzso were cancer zzso The zzso binding site on the zzso gene was required for induction of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso was zzso through the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso as zzso zzso reduced the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso DR zzso and TRAIL zzso The induction of zzso by this zzso was independent of zzso but zzso to TRAIL was zzso The zzso zzso the expression of cell survival proteins and zzso the zzso zzso The combination of zzso with TRAIL was found to be additive at zzso lower than zzso whereas at higher zzso the combination was zzso Overall, this study indicates that zzso can sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL through zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cell survival zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
