The rapid expansion of zzso copy number zzso studies brings a demand for increased precision and resolution of zzso zzso Recent studies have obtained zzso estimates from more than one platform for the same set of samples, and it is natural to want to combine the different estimates in order to meet this zzso Estimates from different platforms show different degrees of zzso of the true zzso zzso Similar differences can be observed in zzso from the same platform run in different labs, or in the same lab, with different zzso zzso This is the reason why it is not straightforward to combine zzso estimates from different sources zzso labs and analysis zzso 

We propose a zzso zzso source zzso that brings zzso zzso estimates to the same scale across zzso The zzso zzso are such that for any underlying zzso level, their mean level is the same regardless of the source, which make them better suited for being combined across sources, zzso existing zzso methods may be used to identify zzso zzso We use zzso zzso estimates from 'The Cancer Genome zzso zzso project to illustrate and validate the zzso We show that the zzso and combined data better separate two zzso states at a given zzso We conclude that it is possible to combine zzso from multiple sources such that the resolution becomes effectively larger, and when multiple platforms are combined, they also enhance the zzso coverage by zzso each other in different zzso 

A zzso zzso is available in zzso
