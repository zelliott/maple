As an alternative to cell specific cancer targeting strategies (which are often afflicted with the zzso of cancer cells as with most biological zzso a novel zzso zzso constitute of two block zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso formed via the dialysis method was approximately 95 zzso in diameter and contained 15 zzso of zzso zzso by zzso The zzso surface hides zzso during zzso which has the strong capability to zzso the zzso into cells, and exposes zzso at a slightly zzso tumor zzso pH to facilitate the zzso zzso The zzso core was engineered for disintegration in early zzso pH of tumor cells, quickly releasing zzso The zzso process of the block zzso and zzso zzso assisted in zzso the zzso zzso This processes permitted high zzso zzso in the zzso and its target site of the nucleus, thus increasing zzso potency in various wild and zzso resistant zzso cell lines zzso times lower zzso than free zzso depending on cell zzso When tested with the zzso tumors of human zzso tumor drug-resistant zzso human breast tumor zzso zzso human lung tumor zzso and human zzso tumor zzso in a nude mice model, all tumors significantly zzso in size by three zzso injections at a dose of zzso 10 zzso zzso body per injection of zzso zzso at three day zzso while minimum weight loss was zzso This approach may replace the need for zzso zzso or targeting zzso thereby providing a general strategy for solid tumor zzso
