We sought to investigate the utility of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a sample of terminally ill cancer patients by examining the scale zzso Moreover, we sought to identify and remove potentially problematic items in order to ascertain a zzso index of zzso for this zzso 

A zzso study of 200 hospice zzso with a life expectancy of less than 6 zzso The zzso as well as several other distress measures, were administered to patients at bedside by trained zzso 

An item analysis of the HS was conducted, looking specifically at item endorsement and zzso zzso Three zzso versions zzso zzso zzso were developed based on certain zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso of the original zzso HS was then compared to that of the newly developed zzso zzso 

All scales were found to be reliable and valid measures of zzso The three zzso versions were more highly correlated with the distress measures than the original version, and the zzso and zzso zzso outperformed the original HS in the prediction of suicidal zzso and desire for hastened zzso 

The data suggest that the HS may be improved, when applied to a terminally ill sample, by the elimination of problematic zzso The development of a zzso purer measure of zzso for this population is crucial given the need to reduce the burden placed on those who participate in zzso studies, and the important role of zzso in the prediction of suicide and desire for hastened zzso
