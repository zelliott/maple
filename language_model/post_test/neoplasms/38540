To determine whether the measurement of zzso fluid pH in zzso zzso has diagnostic use, predicts survival, and has therapeutic zzso 

A prospective comparison of zzso examinations and zzso biopsy results, survival, and response to chemical zzso with zzso in patients with zzso zzso or zzso and zzso (less than zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Academic medical center, university referral hospital, city hospital, and Veterans Administration zzso 

Sixty patients with zzso zzso zzso proven at either initial zzso by zzso examination or within 4 months of initial zzso by repeat zzso zzso or autopsy, were followed until zzso 

zzso patients, 12 with normal zzso fluid pH and 9 with low zzso fluid zzso were treated with tube zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The 20 patients with zzso zzso zzso had a significantly greater zzso on initial zzso fluid zzso zzso a shorter mean survival, and a poorer response to zzso zzso compared with 40 patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso fluid pH in zzso zzso provides a rational approach to further diagnostic testing, zzso information, and a rationale for zzso zzso
