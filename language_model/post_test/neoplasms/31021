To determine whether a nutritional supplement of zzso will decrease the zzso of zzso 

A zzso zzso randomized, zzso cancer prevention zzso 

Seven dermatology clinics in the eastern United zzso 

A total of zzso patients zzso age, 63 years; range, zzso zzso with a history of zzso cell or zzso cell zzso of the skin were zzso from 1983 through zzso Patients were treated for a mean zzso of zzso zzso years and had a total follow-up of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso administration of 200 zzso of zzso per day or zzso 

The primary end points for the trial were the zzso of zzso and zzso cell zzso of the zzso The secondary end points, established in 1990, were zzso mortality and total cancer zzso total cancer zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

After a total follow-up of zzso zzso zzso treatment did not significantly affect the zzso of zzso cell or zzso cell skin zzso There were 377 new cases of zzso cell skin cancer among patients in the zzso group and 350 cases among the control group zzso risk zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and 218 new zzso cell skin zzso in the zzso group and 190 cases among the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of secondary end points revealed that, compared with controls, patients treated with zzso had a zzso reduction in zzso mortality zzso deaths in the zzso group and 129 deaths in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significant reductions in total cancer mortality (29 deaths in the zzso treatment group and 57 deaths in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total cancer zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and 119 in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and prostate zzso zzso because of the apparent reductions in total cancer mortality and total cancer zzso in the zzso group, the blinded phase of the trial was stopped zzso No cases of zzso toxicity zzso 

zzso treatment did not protect against development of zzso or zzso cell zzso of the zzso However, results from secondary zzso analyses support the hypothesis that supplemental zzso may reduce the zzso of, and mortality from, zzso of several zzso These effects of zzso require confirmation in an independent trial of appropriate design before new public health recommendations regarding zzso supplementation can be made
