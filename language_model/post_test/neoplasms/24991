zzso are good potential tools for early cancer zzso Here we have analyzed eight different zzso in the urine samples of cancer patients and compared them with samples from healthy zzso zzso are important zzso in the process of cell zzso and they have recently become a focal point of cancer screening research because certain zzso levels have been shown to reflect the presence of zzso 

We analyzed 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid using a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection zzso The levels of zzso were reported as a ratio of zzso to zzso zzso hypothesis testing was conducted and P values were calculated to analyze the zzso 

Among the eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were significantly higher in samples from cancer patients than in those from healthy zzso Further, zzso and zzso levels were compared in breast cancer and lung cancer patients, but no significant difference was zzso 

Some zzso levels can be used as zzso for zzso diagnosis of zzso however, more data is needed to support this zzso
