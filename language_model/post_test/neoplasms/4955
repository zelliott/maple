zzso zzso are considered as key regulators of literally all cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and their individual cellular functions must be tightly regulated as zzso zzso are transcribed as primary zzso which are processed to mature zzso in two consecutive maturation zzso Finally, the mature zzso is incorporated into a zzso complex, where it directly interacts with a member of the zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso guides such protein complexes to partial complementary target sites, which are typically located in the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso leading to zzso of gene zzso zzso activity and abundance is regulated on various levels ranging from zzso and processing to target site binding and zzso zzso Recent advances in our understanding of how zzso activity is regulated in zzso cells are zzso and discussed in this review zzso
