The aim was to investigate in patients receiving zzso whether any zzso in zzso zzso metabolism or blood flow as assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso could be observed either after the first dose of the drug, or during its chronic zzso 

Six female zzso cancer patients treated with zzso were included in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and PET scanning with zzso zzso were performed the day before the initiation of zzso treatment at a dosage of 50 zzso every 3 weeks, and 3 weeks after the cumulative administration of 300 zzso zzso zzso In addition, PET was performed 24 h after the first administration of zzso zzso of acute zzso zzso zzso metabolism and blood flow were assessed by PET zzso and chronic zzso and left zzso ejection fraction was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using PET for both acute and chronic toxicity evaluations, no significant effect of zzso was observed either on the flux through the zzso acid zzso cycle or on zzso blood zzso However, zzso left zzso function showed a small but significant impairment after the administration of 300 zzso of zzso 

Other hypotheses should be explored to better explain the zzso mechanisms of the zzso of zzso in zzso
