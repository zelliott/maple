zzso a member of the zzso family of growth factors, exerts its biological activity through zzso of the zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso in diverse biological zzso including heart development and zzso skin wound healing, zzso formation, zzso zzso progression of zzso and tumor formation, through the zzso of signaling molecules downstream of zzso receptors and interactions with molecules associated with zzso Recent studies have indicated that zzso gene expression is significantly elevated in many human zzso and its expression level in a number of zzso cell lines is much higher than those of other zzso zzso Several lines of evidence have indicated that zzso plays a key role in the acquisition of zzso zzso such as zzso invasion, zzso and resistance to zzso Studies in zzso and in zzso have indicated that zzso expression is essential for tumor formation of zzso cell zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso and an zzso against zzso are both able to inhibit tumor growth in nude zzso These results indicate that zzso is a promising target for cancer therapy, and that the development of targeting tools against zzso could represent a novel type of therapeutic strategy, as an alternative to targeting zzso zzso
