zzso zzso drug delivery approaches with zzso have been drawing considerable attentions over the zzso Here we described a zzso delivery system modified with zzso cell penetrating zzso zzso zzso Conventional cell penetrating zzso zzso drug delivery tactics sometimes seemed limited due to the extensive in zzso penetration and the lack of proper selectivity of conventional zzso In this study, zzso zzso an engineered zzso cell penetrating zzso originated from zzso zzso zzso was endowed zzso after complete replacement of all zzso in the sequence of zzso into zzso and was introduced onto the surface of zzso zzso zzso could benefit from the unique property of zzso as the cell penetrating capacity of zzso was concealed during the blood circulation and in normal zzso because of the neutral pH under those zzso However, when zzso reached the zzso and as pH declined, zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the surface charge of zzso converted from negative to positive, initiating activated cell penetrating capacity and leading to enhanced cellular and tumor zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso of zzso was influenced by the positively charged surface of the zzso in zzso environment and was zzso by zzso and the zzso trafficking study suggested that the zzso were mainly accumulated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso After systemic administration in mice, zzso could be zzso into tumor cells zzso When it comes to the delivery of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso led to strong zzso against tumor cell growth which occurred both in zzso (under pH zzso and in zzso and the tumor zzso rate reached zzso on zzso zzso mice for zzso zzso zzso zzso proved itself to be a promising zzso strategy for drug delivery within zzso tumor zzso
