To investigate the safety and zzso and to explore the zzso and zzso profile of the humanized zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with solid tumors that express zzso growth factor zzso zzso 

This was a phase I zzso trial of zzso in patients with advanced, zzso solid zzso that were not amenable to any established chemotherapy or zzso zzso zzso was administered weekly without routine zzso until disease progression or unacceptable zzso 

Twenty-two patients were treated with zzso at five different dose levels zzso to 2,000 zzso National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3 headache and fever occurring after the first infusion were dose limiting at 2,000 zzso thus, the zzso dose was zzso zzso No other severe side effects, especially no allergic reactions or zzso were zzso zzso skin reaction was the most common zzso but it was mild, with grade 1 in 11 patients zzso and grade 2 in three patients zzso zzso analyses demonstrated a predictable zzso profile for zzso zzso studies on serial skin zzso revealed that zzso effectively zzso zzso cell signaling zzso reduced zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso with no zzso in total zzso zzso zzso responses zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and disease stabilization zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were achieved at all dose levels, and responding patients received treatment for up to 18 months without cumulative zzso 

Treatment with zzso was well tolerated and showed evidence of activity in heavily zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso at the investigated doses significantly inhibited downstream zzso zzso
