Previous studies have suggested that peripheral blood stem cell zzso transplantation has an advantage over zzso bone zzso zzso 

To compare the zzso recovery and costs associated with zzso transplantation with those associated with zzso bone zzso transplantation in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy for solid tumors or zzso 

zzso randomized, controlled clinical zzso 

French Federation of Cancer Centers, located in cancer facilities or public hospitals with transplantation zzso 

Children and adults with solid tumors or zzso who were candidates for high-dose zzso 

Bone zzso or zzso zzso 

The major and point was the duration of zzso zzso count zzso 50 zzso zzso An economic evaluation of both types of transplantation was done zzso to measure costs and zzso 

129 patients entered the zzso 64 had zzso zzso and 65 had bone zzso zzso The median duration of zzso was 16 days in the zzso group and 35 days in the bone zzso group zzso zzso zzso All of the other clinical end points studied zzso to last zzso zzso duration of zzso number of zzso episodes, and duration of zzso favored zzso zzso A cost analysis showed that total cost was decreased by zzso in adults and zzso in children with zzso zzso thus, zzso transplantation was clearly more cost-effective than bone zzso transplantation for both zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso is associated with more rapid zzso recovery than is bone zzso transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy for solid tumors or zzso Furthermore, global costs are lower and zzso ratios are better with zzso zzso
