Laboratory and clinical studies suggest that genetic change is zzso involved in the development of cancer and that this change occurs in humans throughout zzso in both early and late zzso zzso the zzso of the level of genetic change in human zzso zzso may serve as a marker for cancer zzso The zzso test has been used to zzso the level of zzso zzso breakage occurring in zzso zzso of individuals at elevated risk for zzso These studies include individuals exposed to zzso patients who have zzso zzso and individuals with zzso zzso As a counterpart to this approach, the zzso has been used to study the suppression of this breakage with zzso agents, some of which occur naturally in the zzso These agents include zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Not all of these agents were zzso The success of the treatment depended on both the agent being used and the population being zzso The results of these studies suggest that successful intervention with zzso agents will depend on tailoring treatment regimens to specific zzso The zzso test can be used along with other biological end points to obtain an early indication of the efficacy of zzso agents in altering biological changes associated with zzso in zzso of high-risk zzso
