In order to overcome limitations of zzso zzso new zzso scaffolds have been designed and evaluated zzso and some of them are in clinical studies for the treatment of zzso These entities can be placed into two zzso scaffolds which bind zzso via zzso acids in exposed zzso and those in which zzso binding is zzso by zzso acids in secondary structures, such as zzso zzso zzso we discuss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated zzso zzso zzso which fall into the first category, while zzso zzso zzso and zzso repeat zzso scaffolds are members of the second zzso In addition, we also discuss the new molecular entities as imaging tools and outline their unique characteristics in the context of zzso and zzso zzso
