Cell enrichment methods that deal with larger volumes of peripheral blood and zzso are needed for increased sensitivity of zzso characterization and zzso of isolated tumor cells zzso This study was designed to evaluate a new zzso the zzso Imaging zzso Event zzso detection method, which zzso the majority of the zzso and zzso in a peripheral blood zzso sample, thereby zzso enriching tumor cells if zzso This enrichment procedure allows for increased sensitivity, by analyzing a zzso fold larger volume of blood, compared with a direct zzso zzso technique, with minimal impact on laboratory zzso Model experiments showed comparable tumor cell zzso between the two tested methods, both in zzso and zzso Clinical samples were evaluated using paired zzso and zzso samples from 95 zzso zzso Analysis of zzso results showed that zzso had zzso or zzso 1 tumor cell detected by the zzso zzso compared with zzso after direct zzso analysis, analyzing a zzso larger volume by the zzso zzso The direct zzso analysis of zzso from the same patients revealed zzso zzso The zzso detection differed both zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso as samples with high numbers of zzso in zzso were still negative in zzso The clinical significance of zzso in blood still needs to be zzso However, the easy access of peripheral blood, and the increased sensitivity obtained by increasing the sample volume with the zzso zzso suggests that the value of peripheral blood analysis should be tested in parallel in studies where zzso detection in zzso is zzso
