A Phase I and pharmacological study of zzso administered as an zzso zzso zzso infusion just before a zzso regimen of daily zzso zzso and a continuous infusion of zzso zzso was performed in patients with advanced solid zzso A secondary objective was to determine the objective response rate to this zzso zzso patients were enrolled and were zzso for zzso zzso patients were previously zzso whereas the rest had received prior treatment with radiation zzso zzso Schiller et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso Kennedy et zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso or both zzso zzso zzso Schiller et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso dose was escalated from zzso to 250 zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso doses were fixed at zzso zzso continuous infusion and 20 zzso respectively, daily for 5 zzso zzso zzso factor zzso 5 zzso was administered zzso from day 6, routinely after 250 zzso dose of zzso or after a lower dose of zzso if zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso Patients were treated every 28 zzso Plasma and urine samples were collected to determine the zzso of zzso In previously zzso patients, the zzso tolerated dose of zzso in the drug regimen was determined to be 170 zzso without and 250 zzso with zzso zzso At the higher dose level, zzso and zzso were zzso In previously treated patients, these zzso were observed at all dose levels of zzso zzso or zzso zzso With increasing doses of zzso a disproportionate increase in the peak zzso as well as the area under plasma concentration zzso was zzso This zzso was due to zzso total body clearance and volume of distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso The apparent plasma elimination zzso was unaffected by the dose of zzso zzso and zzso had no apparent effect on the metabolism of zzso Among 32 patients zzso for response, 22 demonstrated an objective response, including five complete zzso zzso a regimen of zzso infusion of 250 zzso zzso before zzso and zzso is tolerable with zzso (as above) support in previously zzso zzso The regimen also seems to be highly active against breast and zzso zzso
