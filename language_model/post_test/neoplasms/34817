zzso quality control steps, termed zzso tightly regulate progression through the cell zzso zzso chemotherapy and radiation activate functional cellular zzso These checkpoints can facilitate DNA repair and promote cell death in zzso zzso There are at least three DNA damage checkpoints - at zzso zzso and zzso - as well as a zzso zzso zzso Most cancer cells zzso zzso in zzso zzso and/or zzso which impair certain cell zzso zzso the remaining cell checkpoints - particularly after exposure of cancer cells to chemotherapy and/or radiation - allows cell death, a strategy now being employed in cancer zzso With our increasing knowledge of cell cycle regulation, many compounds have been developed to inhibit specific checkpoint zzso particularly at the zzso zzso One such target is checkpoint zzso zzso We review here the molecular framework of the cell cycle, the rationale for targeting zzso the zzso concepts related to the development of zzso zzso and the efficacy and safety results from zzso zzso now in phase zzso zzso
