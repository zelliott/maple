zzso cells use a wide variety of zzso mechanisms to modify the functional repertoire of their zzso One emerging but still zzso mechanism involves the export of zzso proteins that then partner with zzso receptors and modify both the zzso zzso and signaling properties of these zzso Recent investigations demonstrate zzso roles for the proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to name a few, during zzso and zzso Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of unconventional zzso export by focusing on the zzso protein zzso which is zzso in many human zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso and zzso this association zzso the zzso activity of zzso that might contribute to tumor progression by promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sustains zzso surface display and enhances zzso signaling through zzso and zzso zzso it might also contribute to tumor progression by enhancing and/or zzso the zzso zzso properties of zzso The unconventional export of proteins such as zzso is a novel process that zzso the roles of tumor zzso and zzso such as zzso and zzso and might provide new targets for therapeutic zzso
