A novel approach for zzso of cancer is presently under zzso This treatment initially developed by Steven Rosenberg and colleagues is based on both the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso using zzso 2 and the simultaneous infusion of the zzso in zzso The two major limiting factors for these new protocols are, on the one hand, the heavy infrastructure necessary for in zzso cell treatment, and, on the other hand, the zzso toxicity of zzso zzso zzso of clinical trials are still zzso they suggest that the therapy may be of interest in zzso and zzso cell zzso However, only a minority of patients with these relatively susceptible tumors display substantial zzso Thus, the protocols need to be improved which makes it critical to understand the biological mechanisms underlying tumor zzso in zzso The dominant working hypothesis is that zzso enhances zzso in zzso and then in zzso the activity of certain zzso able to destroy tumor cells via a direct zzso zzso This view supported by zzso experimental models remains to be demonstrated in the zzso One way of testing it, is to infuse highly zzso zzso of killer zzso instead of the whole peripheral blood suspensions that are used zzso We are attempting to develop this approach and a trial is presently beginning at the zzso Institute in a series of patients with zzso cell zzso
