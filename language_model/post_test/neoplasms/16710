The combination of zzso zzso and conventional zzso agents offers a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of zzso However, there is as yet no consensus on optimal strategies for combining this family of compounds with other cancer zzso While in zzso studies have demonstrated both direct zzso and zzso effects for zzso a more interesting role derives from its ability to zzso zzso the activity of a wide variety of zzso agents against multiple human and zzso tumors, both in zzso and in animal zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso agents in zzso is complex and depends not only on the choice of zzso agent but also on the zzso ratios, zzso and sequence of exposure to the two zzso zzso data suggest that some combinations are not merely additive but rather that zzso may zzso zzso the cellular zzso or metabolism of the zzso agent resulting in synergistic zzso zzso In zzso interactions between zzso and zzso agents involve an additional layer of complexity because of the potential effects of the biological agent on the host immune system and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may have a protective effect on normal host zzso which theoretically could allow for the delivery of higher doses of zzso zzso The results of early clinical trials using combinations of zzso with zzso agents have generally been zzso This may be due to the inability of zzso models to accurately predict the clinical situation or alternatively from a failure to incorporate information on dose, zzso and sequence of drug administration into clinical zzso zzso clinical studies with zzso and the fluorinated zzso zzso in patients with advanced zzso zzso suggest that zzso may enhance the effects of the zzso zzso trials are in zzso Further trials designed to exploit the zzso experience with combinations of zzso and zzso agents are zzso
