The application of next-generation sequencing technology has produced a transformation in cancer zzso generating large data sets that can be analyzed in different ways to answer a multitude of questions about the zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso approaches can discover focused zzso such as zzso and small zzso large structural zzso and copy number zzso As our capacity to produce such data for multiple zzso of the same type is improving, so are the demands to analyze multiple tumor zzso simultaneously zzso For example, zzso analyses that provide the full zzso impact on cellular protein networks and correlation analyses aimed at revealing zzso relationships between zzso zzso and clinical presentations are both zzso As the repertoire of data grows to include zzso zzso zzso and zzso for multiple zzso our challenge will be to intelligently integrate data types and zzso to produce a coherent picture of the genetic basis of zzso
