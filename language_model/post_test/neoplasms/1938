Mean plasma zzso of the main zzso of blood zzso zzso III zzso zzso protein C and protein S were determined in 149 patients with different local and zzso zzso zzso were compared with findings in 44 healthy zzso No statistical significant differences for AT III, protein C and free protein S were found between patients and zzso However, total protein S showed a significant increase in the patient group zzso less than zzso None of the parameters analyzed showed differences according to the degree of zzso activity nor to the zzso zzso We conclude that the main zzso of the blood zzso seem not to play an important role in the zzso of the zzso state in zzso The increased levels in total protein S would indicate zzso synthesis in response to zzso zzso
