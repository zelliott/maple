When making treatment decisions, cancer patients must make zzso among zzso zzso and zzso However, little is known about what patient characteristics may influence these zzso 

A total of 400 cancer patients reviewed 2 of 3 stylized zzso and zzso scenarios that asked them to choose between 2 treatments of varying levels of zzso zzso and zzso Each scenario included 9 choice zzso zzso cost concerns, zzso and optimism were zzso Within each scenario, we used zzso class methods to distinguish groups with discrete zzso We then used zzso with group membership probabilities as zzso to identify zzso 

The median age of the patients was 61 years zzso zzso zzso Of the total number of patients included, zzso were enrolled at a community hospital, and zzso were zzso Three zzso classes were identified that demonstrated zzso preference for survival, zzso zzso to high cost, and zzso zzso to zzso Across all scenarios, patients with higher income were more likely to be in the class that favored zzso Lower income patients were more likely to be in the class that was averse to high cost zzso Similar associations were found between education, employment status, zzso cost concerns, and zzso zzso 

Even in these stylized scenarios, socioeconomic status predicted the treatment zzso Higher income patients may be more likely to focus on survival, whereas those of lower socioeconomic status may be more likely to avoid expensive treatment, regardless of survival or zzso This raises the possibility that insurance plans with greater cost-sharing may have the unintended consequence of increasing disparities in cancer zzso
