zzso total zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso levels have drawn considerable interest because of zzso aberrations in zzso zzso The current investigation determined the zzso zzso total protein zzso and zzso values for zzso cancer patients with various primary sites and differing degrees of zzso disease, 102 patients with zzso diseases zzso zzso and 42 normal zzso Data analysis indicated significant zzso less than zzso increases in the mean zzso zzso zzso and zzso values in the cancer patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to the normal controls zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and a significant decrease in the mean zzso values in the cancer patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to normal controls zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was observed between groups in zzso zzso Further analysis of the data in patient zzso based on the tissue involved, specific disease, or severity of the zzso indicated that the lack of specificity of the markers was due primarily to restricted zzso and that the sensitivity of zzso and zzso increased as the zzso became more zzso The results show that zzso was the most useful of the markers tested for detecting zzso This marker should prove useful for monitoring zzso disease recurrence and/or progression and for evaluating the effectiveness of various therapeutic zzso
