zzso technology is increasingly used to identify potential zzso for cancer zzso and zzso Previously, we have developed the zzso zzso Model zzso zzso zzso for use in zzso Here, we extend the zzso zzso zzso for application to survival analysis on zzso zzso zzso The main goal in applying survival analysis to zzso data is to determine a highly zzso model of patients' time to event (such as death, zzso or zzso using a small number of selected zzso Our zzso procedure combines the effectiveness of multiple contending models by calculating the weighted average of their zzso probability zzso Our results demonstrate that our zzso zzso zzso for survival analysis achieves high prediction accuracy while consistently selecting a small and cost-effective number of predictor zzso 

We applied the zzso zzso zzso to two cancer zzso breast cancer and diffuse large zzso zzso zzso zzso On the breast cancer data, the zzso selected a total of 15 predictor genes across 84 contending models from the training zzso The maximum likelihood estimates of the selected genes and the zzso probabilities of the selected models from the training data were used to divide patients in the test (or zzso zzso into zzso and low-risk zzso Using the genes and models determined from the training data, we assigned patients from the test data into highly distinct risk groups (as indicated by a zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso Moreover, we achieved comparable results using only the 5 top selected genes with zzso zzso zzso On the zzso data, our zzso zzso procedure selected a total of 25 genes across 3 contending models from the training zzso Once again, we assigned the patients in the validation set to significantly distinct risk groups zzso zzso zzso 

The strength of the zzso zzso zzso for survival analysis lies in its ability to account for model zzso The results from this study demonstrate that our procedure selects a small number of genes while zzso other methods in zzso performance, making it a highly accurate and cost-effective zzso tool in the clinical zzso
