zzso abnormalities may accumulate in human embryonic stem cells zzso during in zzso zzso zzso of the mechanisms enabling survival and expansion of abnormal zzso is important due to consequences of genetic changes for the therapeutic zzso of stem zzso Furthermore, these cells provide an excellent model to study transformation in zzso We report here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are increased in zzso abnormal zzso when compared to their normal zzso zzso similar to many cancer cell lines, we found that zzso zzso repress proliferation of the zzso abnormal zzso whereas normal cells are more resistant to the zzso The decreased proliferation zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso induction of the proliferation zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and altered regulation of tumor zzso protein zzso 1 zzso Through zzso zzso analysis we have identified genes with altered expression and responsiveness to zzso zzso in abnormal zzso Most of these genes are linked to severe zzso and neurological diseases and zzso Our results highlight the importance of zzso mechanisms in the regulation of zzso stability of zzso and provide valuable candidates for targeted and selective growth zzso of zzso abnormal zzso
