For most of the 25,000 human zzso the removal of zzso by zzso zzso zzso represents an essential step towards the production of functional zzso zzso Moreover, a majority of zzso zzso is alternatively spliced to yield different zzso zzso Cancer cells often display zzso profiles of alternative zzso producing zzso that can stimulate cell proliferation and migration or improve resistance to zzso While zzso at zzso sites or in zzso control elements have been identified, changes are also caused by zzso in the expression of proteins that affect zzso site zzso Current challenges consist in documenting the functional diversity generated by alternative zzso and its contribution to different types of zzso The development of innovative approaches aimed at zzso alternative zzso offers promising perspectives in cancer zzso
