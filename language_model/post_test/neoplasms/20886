Human biological liquids comprise various zzso which zzso at liquid zzso and lead to a variation in surface zzso The zzso processes involving low molecular weight zzso proteins and zzso play a vital role in the zzso functions of the human zzso especially if large surfaces are involved zzso gas exchange in zzso metabolism of zzso liver and zzso Dynamic surface zzso studies of biological liquids like serum and zzso fluid provide surrogate parameters that reflect surface tension zzso We provide dynamic surface tension data of serum and zzso fluid that were collected from healthy volunteers and patients with zzso neurological or zzso zzso Our studies indicate that dynamic surface tension data are helpful for diagnostic purposes and for monitoring of therapeutic zzso
