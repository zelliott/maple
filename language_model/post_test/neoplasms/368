A sensitive and specific procedure for measuring plasma levels of zzso zzso a zzso agent currently undergoing phase I trials, has been zzso zzso was isolated zzso greater than zzso from zzso plasma samples by zzso exchange zzso followed by zzso zzso and was zzso by selected zzso monitoring with a gas zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and used as an internal zzso standard zzso were prepared by plotting zzso zzso ratios versus zzso and were linear in the range of zzso zzso The zzso of variation for repeated zzso was less than zzso at all zzso zzso To test the zzso of this method to clinical studies, plasma zzso of zzso were measured in two studies in each of three cancer patients receiving zzso doses of zzso as zzso zzso zzso Peak plasma zzso observed immediately after the end of the zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma elimination was found to be zzso a short initial zzso zzso 27 minutes) was followed by a longer elimination zzso of 133 minutes zzso zzso 35 zzso zzso in two patients indicated that less than zzso of the administered zzso was zzso unchanged in the urine in 24 hours, suggesting that zzso metabolism of zzso may be a major contributor to plasma clearance of the drug in zzso
