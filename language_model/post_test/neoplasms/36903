The clinical zzso of the zzso agent zzso zzso are associated with substantial zzso zzso The degree to which this zzso in zzso exposure impacts upon the response and toxicity of the drug has not yet been properly zzso In general, the area under the plasma zzso curve zzso is an appropriate indicator of exposure, but requires collection of up to 17 timed blood zzso This presents difficulties if large-scale population zzso are zzso The present study involved the development and validation of a strategy to estimate the zzso of the zzso and total zzso zzso plus zzso forms of zzso and its active zzso zzso from a limited number of blood samples in patients zzso with zzso Using data from 24 patients, zzso and zzso zzso analyses were employed to generate the zzso The best zzso models for simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were obtained with three time points at zzso zzso and zzso h after start of the 90 zzso zzso infusion of zzso The models were tested separately in another group of 24 patients receiving the same combination zzso This validation set demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso after standard dose administration could be predicted sufficiently unbiased and precisely with three timed samples to warrant clinical zzso
