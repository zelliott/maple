Efforts to detect and investigate key zzso zzso have proven valuable to facilitate the appropriate treatment for cancer zzso The establishment of zzso zzso parallel zzso sequencing has aided the discovery of many such zzso To enhance the clinical and zzso utility of this technology, platforms must be zzso zzso and compatible with zzso zzso embedded zzso tissue samples that may yield small amounts of zzso or damaged zzso Here, we describe the preparation of zzso and zzso DNA libraries followed by zzso capture of targeted zzso for the detection of zzso zzso in fresh frozen and zzso tumors by zzso parallel zzso This method enables the identification of sequence zzso copy number zzso and select structural zzso involving all targeted zzso zzso zzso sequencing offers the benefits of high zzso low cost, and deep sequence coverage, thus zzso high sensitivity for detecting low frequency zzso
