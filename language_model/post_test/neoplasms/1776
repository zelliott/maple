zzso are the structures at the ends of zzso composed of repetitive sequences and associated zzso which cap zzso ends to maintain zzso zzso These structures are maintained by the zzso complex zzso in germ cells and some stem cells, but are absent in the majority of zzso zzso The consequence of this lack of zzso in normal zzso cells is the zzso of the zzso zzso which results in a limited zzso life zzso However, in cancer cells, which grow indefinitely, zzso activity has been detected in a large number of different cancer cell zzso This has lead to a great deal of interest in establishing techniques to measure zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso function in both normal and cancer zzso Here we describe the zzso zzso repeat amplification zzso zzso a technique to measure zzso activity in cells, zzso zzso restriction zzso zzso analysis to estimate zzso zzso and both the zzso bridge index and the frequency of zzso zzso as indicators of zzso zzso
