Ten genes responsible for the increase of specific tumor zzso in affected families have been localized on the human genetic zzso This knowledge not only provides the mean of a precise genetic zzso but also opens a way for further investigating the genetic mechanisms of these zzso Usually, it is admitted that zzso inherited familial predisposition to tumors is due to a defective tumor zzso zzso This hypothesis is almost certain for familial zzso highly probable for zzso zzso and possible for zzso type zzso In contrast, the gene for familial zzso coli shows some characteristics of activated zzso
