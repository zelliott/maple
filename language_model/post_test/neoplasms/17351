Advances in zzso and targeted therapies during the past decade have changed how zzso is zzso zzso zzso has emerged from the accumulated evidence garnered from matching targeted therapies with tumor molecular zzso zzso current knowledge derived from zzso zzso parallel sequencing technologies and global research initiatives such as the international 1000 zzso Project, the Cancer Genome Atlas, the International Cancer Genome zzso and publicly available catalogs such as the zzso of zzso zzso in Cancer and zzso of Drug zzso in Cancer have illuminated the utility of understanding the molecular basis of cancer through zzso zzso In addition, multiple collaborative efforts are widening the possibility of universally zzso cancer zzso Although several key challenges of personalized cancer medicine zzso need to be zzso some pilot studies are transforming the way we analyze tumor tissue molecular zzso design clinical trials, and measure treatment zzso Taken together, these pilot studies are paving the way for clinical trials that are designed to zzso test the concept of zzso In this paper, we describe lessons learned from the first pilot initiatives of zzso and how this knowledge is being used to design novel clinical zzso
