After four decades of study, the biological role of fetal zzso zzso remains zzso Transfer of fetal cells to the mother begins soon after zzso and increases with zzso zzso zzso cells then decline after delivery, but remain zzso for years zzso These cells have been implicated in zzso arthritis zzso during pregnancy and the prevention of breast cancer by zzso However, any beneficial effects contrast with their suspected zzso in triggering of systemic sclerosis after zzso or their zzso support for tumor zzso Recent evidence that zzso cells participate in disease and tissue repair has stirred controversy on their zzso The detection of zzso cells during early zzso together with the diversity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and plasticity of zzso when integrated into various zzso provides evidence for their zzso However, proof of their zzso in conventional stem cell differentiation zzso has been beset with difficulty in zzso and expanding them in zzso zzso the function of zzso cells will provide insight into both their engagement in disease and their therapeutic zzso
