The relationship of potentially lethal damage repair zzso to clinical zzso has not been studied in great zzso We have therefore examined the cellular and molecular basis of zzso in zzso animal and human tumor systems and attempted to relate laboratory data to clinical zzso zzso We also have examined how the repair of potentially lethal damage may alter the therapeutic ratio by altering tumor zzso and normal tissue zzso
