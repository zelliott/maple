The notion that tumors act as zzso zzso has led to the belief that nutrition support of the zzso patient can enhance tumor zzso Proponents of this theory consider the provision of energy and essential nutrients as well as the influence of hormones and growth factors as responsible for this zzso On the other hand, nutrition administration in the zzso cancer patient may improve zzso host defense mechanisms and reduce tumor zzso This paper reviews zzso issues related to the study of nutrition and cancer growth with emphasis on in zzso methods for measuring tumor protein turnover and zzso Using this combined approach, we previously demonstrated that dietary fat may significantly regulate tumor growth during chronic feeding as well as with short-term intravenous nutrition support in experimental zzso Although the mechanism of this effect remains zzso we have reasoned that by altering zzso acid metabolism and zzso zzso omega-3 fatty acids could change tumor protein breakdown rates and inhibit the proliferation potential of these zzso zzso alternative zzso we now present zzso evidence that zzso protein degradation may regulate tumor cell zzso Additional studies relating dietary fat, tumor protein metabolism and tumor proliferation potential are currently in zzso We propose that the effect of nutrition administration on tumor growth is complex and involves several regulatory zzso Thus, based on available evidence, an a zzso zzso effect for nutrition support is clearly not zzso zzso protein breakdown and host defense mechanisms, both of which are energy dependent, are important zzso at which nutrition and tumor growth regulation could zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
