To identify zzso of low zzso zzso zzso zzso and to investigate the association of low zzso with zzso mortality and risk of liver disease zzso 

Prospective cohort study of zzso participants in the zzso zzso in Communities zzso zzso zzso was used to identify zzso zzso of low zzso and Cox zzso hazards models were used to estimate the association of low zzso with zzso zzso 

Compared with participants with zzso in the normal range zzso to zzso participants with low zzso were younger, less likely to smoke, had lower zzso lower white cell count and zzso levels, and lower prevalence of zzso and history of coronary heart zzso However, this group was more likely to have anemia and had a higher mean zzso zzso In adjusted Cox models with zzso of zzso to zzso as the reference group, zzso zzso was associated with a significantly increased risk of zzso mortality zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of cancer death zzso zzso zzso zzso We also noted zzso trends toward increased risk of death from cardiovascular causes zzso zzso zzso zzso and respiratory causes zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a zzso association between zzso and risk of liver disease zzso 

No single cause of death appeared to drive the association between low zzso and total zzso These results add to evidence that low zzso values may be a generalized marker of mortality risk in the general zzso
