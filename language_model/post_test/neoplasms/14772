During the last decade, zzso technologies including zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been applied to further our understanding of the molecular zzso of this zzso disease, and to develop strategies that aim to improve the management of patients with lung zzso Ultimately, these approaches should lead to sensitive, specific and zzso methods for early diagnosis, and facilitate the prediction of response to therapy and outcome, as well as the identification of potential novel therapeutic zzso zzso studies were the first to move this field forward by providing novel insights into the molecular biology of lung cancer and by generating candidate zzso of disease zzso Lung zzso is driven by genetic and zzso zzso that cause zzso gene zzso however, the challenge remains to pinpoint the key regulatory control mechanisms and to distinguish driver from passenger zzso that may have a small but additive effect on cancer zzso zzso regulation by DNA zzso and zzso modifications zzso zzso structure and, in turn, either activate or silence gene zzso zzso approaches critically complement these molecular studies, as the zzso of a cancer cell is determined by proteins and cannot be predicted by zzso or zzso zzso The present article focuses on the technological platforms available and some proposed clinical zzso We illustrate zzso how the zzso have zzso our approach to lung cancer biology and hold promise for zzso management of lung zzso
