Stem cell research has greatly contributed to the field of zzso with the identification and isolation of cancer stem cells from a variety of zzso The discovery of rare zzso of cancer stem cells has indeed entirely changed the focus of cancer zzso zzso adult stem cells and cancer stem cells can both zzso and undergo a differentiation program that, in turn, gives rise to a high number of differentiated zzso Adult stem cells and their zzso counterparts share almost all of the same intrinsic and zzso factors to regulate zzso differentiation and proliferation zzso zzso of normal and cancer stem cells are naturally more resistant to toxic injuries than any other cell zzso Overall, these observations lead to the conclusion that adult stem or zzso cells can eventually become zzso by generating cancer stem cells, which are responsible for the development and maintenance of the tumor zzso In addition, zzso cancer stem cells may cause the zzso of the disease following an apparent beneficial zzso Indeed, the study of the biology of cancer stem cells might lead to the improvement of preventive cancer diagnosis and to the development of novel zzso which must be designed to selectively target zzso stem cells without affecting normal adult stem zzso
