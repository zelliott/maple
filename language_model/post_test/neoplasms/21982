Joint modeling of zzso and survival data is becoming increasingly essential in most cancer and AIDS clinical zzso We propose a likelihood approach to extend both zzso and survival components to be zzso A zzso mixed effects model is presented to explicitly capture two different sources of dependence among zzso measures over time as well as dependence between different zzso For the survival component of the joint model, we introduce a shared zzso which is assumed to have a positive stable distribution, to induce correlation between failure zzso The proposed marginal zzso survival model, which zzso both zero and zzso cure zzso for the time to event, is then applied to each marginal survival zzso The proposed zzso survival model has a zzso hazards structure for the population zzso zzso as well as zzso when the baseline zzso are specified through a specific zzso In addition, the model is capable of dealing with survival functions with different cure rate zzso The methodology is specifically applied to the International Breast Cancer Study Group zzso trial to investigate the relationship between quality of life, zzso survival, and overall zzso
