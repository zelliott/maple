This study was conducted to compare the relative zzso efficacy and safety of an zzso zzso oral zzso zzso solution with that of an zzso zzso oral zzso zzso zzso 

This was a zzso zzso crossover study in 34 adult male and female zzso with pain due to advanced zzso zzso data were collected on day zzso On days 2 and 3, randomly assigned patients received either zzso plus zzso zzso zzso Laboratories, zzso Columbus, zzso 20 zzso at 2, 6, and 10 am, and 2, 6, and 10 pm, or alternatively zzso zzso zzso zzso Laboratories, zzso 30 zzso at 10 AM and 10 zzso Patients were then crossed over to the alternate treatment for days 4 through zzso zzso relief was measured using a conventional zzso visual analog scale zzso and by recording the zzso of breakthrough zzso Information on side effects was obtained from zzso scores for zzso zzso anxiety, and zzso by directly questioning the patient as to mental confusion, zzso movements, and zzso use; and from zzso performance status zzso zzso data were analyzed using a linear statistical zzso zzso pain data were analyzed using analysis of zzso zzso
