Patients with zzso zzso zzso have recently been reported to be at increased risk of tumor development, but clinical associations related to this observation are zzso We calculated the odds ratios zzso and 95 % confidence intervals zzso of zzso tumor development by patients' demographic and clinical characteristics to evaluate factors associated with tumor development in zzso patients, using data from the National zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Patients and Family zzso Of the 911 participants, zzso % were male and zzso % had zzso type 1 zzso Compared to zzso patients with zzso type 2 zzso were older at registry enrollment zzso age 55 zzso 44 years, p zzso zzso and at zzso diagnosis zzso age 48 zzso 30 years, p zzso zzso and more likely to be females zzso zzso zzso At enrollment, 95 zzso zzso zzso patients reported a history of benign or zzso zzso zzso were associated with female gender zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso p zzso zzso In a zzso analysis of patients with zzso DNA testing results zzso zzso 54 zzso repeat expansion size was not associated with tumor risk in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, female gender and zzso zzso but not DNA repeat expansion size, were associated with increased risk of tumors in zzso zzso studies are warranted to determine if zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso are altered in zzso and to determine if repeat expansion size, as in our study, is not associated with tumor zzso
