The rigorous testing of hypotheses on suitable sample zzso is a major limitation in zzso zzso This is particularly the case for the validation of protein zzso the lack of accurate, zzso and sensitive zzso for most proteins has precluded the systematic assessment of hundreds of potential marker proteins described in the zzso Here, we describe a zzso method for the development and refinement of selected reaction monitoring zzso zzso for human zzso The method was applied to generate such zzso for more than 1000 zzso zzso which are functionally related to candidate cancer driver zzso We used the zzso to determine the zzso of the target proteins in two clinically relevant zzso plasma and zzso One hundred zzso proteins were detected in depleted zzso spanning five orders of magnitude in abundance and reaching below a concentration of 10 zzso The zzso concentration range of proteins in urine allowed the detection of zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that these zzso zzso allow zzso zzso by monitoring 34 zzso candidates across 83 patient plasma zzso Through public access to the entire zzso library, researchers will be able to target their zzso proteins of interest in any sample type using the zzso information in plasma and urine as a zzso The generated zzso reference map of zzso zzso for zzso proteins will be a valuable resource for accelerating and planning zzso zzso zzso
