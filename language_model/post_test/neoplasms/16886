Sixty tumors with a minimum of zzso follow-up were treated with radiation and superficial zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall local control rate was 50% zzso The most important factor in outcome was appropriateness of the zzso zzso zzso covered by at least the zzso zzso zzso achieved zzso local control versus zzso local control with less than zzso zzso coverage zzso less than zzso Several measures of adequate minimum monitored tumor temperature and duration were zzso The measure best correlated with outcome was best single session time at or above 43 degrees C zzso If each monitored tumor zzso achieved zzso greater than or equal to 30 minutes in at least one session, then tumor control was significantly zzso less than zzso improved zzso with zzso zzso greater than or equal to 30 versus zzso with zzso zzso less than zzso Although there was considerable overlap between tumors with zzso greater than or equal to zzso and those achieving zzso zzso greater than or equal to 30, a statistically significant zzso zzso zzso difference could be demonstrated between the group meeting both the zzso and the minimum tumor zzso standards as opposed to those meeting only one zzso The zzso local zzso survival for tumors most likely to have had adequate zzso zzso as zzso greater than or equal to zzso and zzso zzso greater than or equal to 30) and all other tumors did not begin to separate significantly until 8 to 12 months after zzso zzso for future zzso studies are zzso
