In contrast to conventional data mining, which searches for specific zzso of genes zzso zzso to correlate with specific zzso DATE analysis zzso intensive state variables calculated from the same zzso At the heart of DATE analysis are two biological equations of state not dependent on genetic zzso This result zzso DATE analysis from other zzso zzso The zzso state variable F zzso the relative overall cellular activity of test cells compared to zzso reference zzso The variable zzso is the zzso in the expression of the zzso gene of test cells relative to zzso It is the fraction zzso of the zzso undergoing differential zzso the magnitude zzso controls biological zzso The state variable zzso is equivalent to the control strength of zzso control zzso For zzso DATE analysis assumes a linear system of zzso networks and exploits the small average contribution of each cellular zzso This approach was validated by zzso values of the state variables zzso zzso index, and zzso calculated from random zzso of transcript zzso zzso Using published zzso data, zzso zzso index, and zzso were correlated with: zzso the zzso cycle of the malaria zzso zzso embryonic development of the fruit fly, zzso temperature adaptation of zzso zzso exponential growth of cultured zzso pneumoniae, and zzso human zzso DATE analysis was applied to zzso data from the great zzso A good example of the power of DATE analysis is its application to zzso unstable zzso which have been zzso to data mining zzso
