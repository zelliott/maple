zzso has an zzso zzso However, an increase in zzso activity is also implicated in cancer zzso A switch from zzso to zzso affects the zzso and zzso of cancer zzso In view of the key role of this switch in cancer zzso we investigated the regulatory effect of zzso on zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso inhibited the nuclear zzso of zzso and prevented zzso gene zzso zzso pull-down and zzso zzso verified the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso bound the zzso of zzso but not its zzso which comprises the zzso domain responsible for zzso of zzso Our finding that the zzso of zzso to zzso in zzso did not affect the ability of zzso to bind zzso and repress target gene zzso suggests that zzso might not disturb the zzso Studies using zzso zzso of zzso suggested that the zzso domain contributes to the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso attenuated not only the effect of zzso binding to zzso but also zzso zzso of zzso and thereby increased zzso activity, supporting the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso recruits zzso through zzso and assists the function of zzso for the zzso of nuclear zzso and zzso activity of zzso In zzso cells, the loss of zzso by either zzso zzso or treatment with zzso enhanced the zzso or zzso activity of zzso zzso that zzso of cancer cells upon the loss of zzso might be associated with zzso
