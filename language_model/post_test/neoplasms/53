zzso plasma zzso zzso activity was measured in 28 cancer patients with varying degrees of weight loss, and in 16 normal zzso Total zzso zzso activity was decreased by zzso zzso less than zzso in the cancer zzso The component zzso activities, zzso zzso and peripheral zzso were decreased by zzso zzso less than zzso and 38% zzso less than zzso zzso In addition, the level of total peripheral zzso zzso correlated well with the percent body weight lost by these patients zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso Regardless of extent of disease, patients with lung cancer showed the lowest zzso activity zzso 191 zzso zzso 30 zzso P less than zzso and the greatest percent of weight loss zzso zzso while patients with breast cancer had nearly normal zzso activity zzso 315 zzso zzso 50 zzso normal 340 zzso zzso 22 zzso P less than zzso and minimal weight loss zzso zzso zzso serum zzso were significantly elevated in the patient group zzso 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to normal zzso 71 zzso zzso 7 zzso P less than zzso The mean zzso insulin level was elevated in the patient group (13 zzso zzso zzso zzso although in the majority of the patients it was found within the normal range zzso zzso We conclude that the significant decrease in the total zzso activity may be responsible in part for the characteristic zzso present in cancer zzso
