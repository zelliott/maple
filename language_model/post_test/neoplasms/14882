zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso also called zzso They catalyze the transfer of zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso by a zzso mechanism involving the formation of a high energy zzso intermediate zzso zzso Besides their known functions in the control of zzso zzso zzso they are involved in multiple zzso and pathological cellular processes such as zzso development, zzso dissemination or zzso zzso Over the past 15 years, ten human genes have been discovered zzso zzso full zzso and/or zzso repeated zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso extensions and/or additional zzso These genes zzso proteins exhibiting different functions at various zzso and zzso zzso Most of these genes appear late in evolution with the emergence of the zzso zzso This review summarizes the present knowledge on these zzso zzso
