zzso is a novel zzso zzso obtained by zzso using zzso chemistry to selectively introduce two zzso atoms at the zzso position of zzso In human zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso activity in seven out of 11 zzso tested compared with three out of 11 for zzso 

In this phase I study, zzso was administered to 31 patients with advanced zzso as a zzso zzso infusion every 3 weeks according to an escalating schedule of doses between 30 and 400 zzso 

zzso parameters and zzso were assessed and, at 400 zzso three out of five patients experienced zzso zzso At the maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso 400 zzso the toxicity profile of zzso consisted mainly of zzso zzso and zzso of short zzso zzso area under the curve increased as a proportion of the administered dose whereas no zzso of elimination was zzso 

The zzso of zzso was achieved at 400 zzso every 3 zzso According to protocol rules, the recommended dose was established at 350 zzso A preliminary assessment of first patients included in early phase II trials led to reduction of the recommended dose to 320 zzso every 3 weeks for further development of zzso Three partial responses zzso in breast zzso one in zzso cell zzso suggest that activity is likely to be seen in less heavily zzso patient zzso
