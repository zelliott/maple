The poor zzso of zzso zzso often presents a major obstacle in the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso by traditional zzso We have developed a novel method for zzso zzso zzso taking advantage of its poor zzso By mixing two reverse zzso containing zzso and a highly soluble precursor of zzso zzso zzso we have successfully formulated zzso zzso with a zzso size (in the range of zzso and high drug loading capacity zzso zzso The zzso was done in two zzso The pure zzso zzso were first stabilized for zzso in an organic zzso by coating with 1, zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data confirmed that the major ingredient of the zzso zzso was zzso After zzso additional lipids were added to stabilize the zzso for zzso in an zzso zzso The final zzso contain a zzso zzso coating and are named zzso zzso zzso which showed significant zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso Thus, zzso zzso serves as the major material for assembling the novel zzso This unique method of zzso synthesis may be zzso in zzso other zzso zzso
