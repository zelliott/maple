Six normal subjects zzso zzso and 13 cancer patients zzso and zzso zzso were zzso overnight and infused with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso and zzso were isolated, and mass zzso zzso were determined by gas zzso zzso zzso equations modified from those previously described zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we determined zzso production zzso recycling of zzso zzso fraction of recycled molecules in blood zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso from zzso zzso dilution of zzso via the zzso acid cycle and other zzso and rate of zzso zzso production was similar in all groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The fraction of recycled carbon and of the zzso cycle were elevated in the zzso group zzso the zzso and NL groups: 15 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and NL groups, zzso In the NL and zzso groups, zzso of zzso is via recycling, zzso from zzso carbon sources zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso in the zzso group, zzso is from recycling, 50% from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso and other zzso zzso cortisol was elevated in the zzso group zzso the zzso group: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a strong correlation between plasma cortisol and zzso cycle in the NL zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso cortisol was directly, and insulin was zzso correlated with zzso in the NL zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso We conclude that whereas the cancer population is zzso with respect to zzso many cancer patients derive their zzso predominantly from zzso compared with healthy controls, who derive less than one-half of their zzso from zzso
