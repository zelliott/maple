With the recent explosion of interest in the field of zzso viruses are now finding new applications in materials science and zzso Here, we discuss the engineering of zzso zzso that are based upon zzso zzso zzso zzso and that combine multiple functions of zzso imaging and drug zzso We focus on the use of zzso as a carrier and delivery system for zzso other than DNA and develop the rationale behind using zzso for such zzso Due to the modular nature of the Ad zzso multiple therapeutic or diagnostic zzso such as the addition of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, radiation zzso and zzso peptides for vaccines, can be incorporated by zzso different sites on the viral zzso These types of particles have a tremendous potential to increase the sensitivity and specificity of zzso
