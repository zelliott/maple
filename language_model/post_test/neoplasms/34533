zzso of the zzso regulatory network of the normal cell cycle is essential for understanding the zzso that lead to zzso However, the complete set of cycling genes in primary cells has not yet been zzso Here, we report the results of zzso expression profiling experiments on synchronized primary human zzso zzso across the cell zzso Using a combined experimental and zzso approach to zzso measured expression values into zzso expression profiles, we were able to overcome the limitations inherent in zzso zzso zzso zzso This allowed us to identify zzso periodically expressed genes in primary human zzso zzso Analysis of the reconstructed primary cell profiles and comparison with published expression zzso from synchronized transformed cells reveals a large number of genes that cycle exclusively in primary zzso This conclusion was supported by both zzso analysis and experiments performed on other cell zzso We suggest that this approach will help pinpoint genetic elements contributing to normal cell growth and cellular zzso
