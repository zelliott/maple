Adler et zzso in a paper appearing in Nature zzso exploited the intersect of genetic information from expression profiles with that from array comparative zzso zzso in human breast zzso to identify genes that may induce the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso The amplification of two zzso zzso and zzso appeared to be correlated with the wound response zzso In zzso validation showed that the wound signature could be induced in zzso cells only when zzso and zzso were zzso This work shows that the intersect analysis of gene amplification and zzso expression on a zzso scale can uncover complex conditional interactions embedded in the systems map of zzso zzso
