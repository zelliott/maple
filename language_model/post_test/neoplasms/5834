The goal of this study was to evaluate the zzso characteristics of geometric zzso prescription strategies and compare them to those of conventional shielding zzso 

zzso fields, square fields, and 12 irregular fields for patients with cancer of the head and neck, zzso and pelvis were included in this zzso All fields were shaped using the zzso and conventional zzso A geometric criterion was defined as the amount of area zzso between the zzso and the prescription zzso The zzso area zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was searched by selecting the zzso angle, meanwhile keeping a zzso position along the zzso of the leaf into the prescribed zzso Five zzso conventions were zzso These included the zzso zzso zzso and zzso that inserted the leaves at the 0, zzso 1/2, and 2/3 of the leaf end into the prescription field, zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was applied to the zzso zzso approach for leaf zzso that prescribed an equal area of zzso and zzso under each zzso Film zzso was performed in a 20 zzso polystyrene phantom at 10 zzso depth 100 zzso from source to axis distance zzso for both 6 and 18 zzso photons with each of the above zzso zzso and conventional zzso The field zzso zzso defined as the mean of the separation between the zzso and zzso zzso lines along the normal of the prescription field edge, was calculated using both the zzso and conventional block film zzso and zzso In a similar way, the zzso is defined as the mean separation between the zzso zzso line and the prescription field edge, and the zzso is defined as the mean separation between the zzso zzso line and the prescription field zzso 

The field zzso zzso for all zzso conventions was approximately 2 zzso larger than that of the conventional zzso However, there was a larger variation of the separation distribution in the zzso region of the irregular fields for the zzso which had a standard zzso of 1 zzso (a factor of 5 larger than the conventional zzso The zzso for the circular fields showed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the conventional blocking well in terms of zzso and zzso however, no single convention produced the best zzso for both zzso The zzso result of the patient treatment fields was similar for all zzso The zzso zzso and zzso strategies zzso to within 1 to zzso zzso of the zzso of the conventional block for both 6 zzso and 18 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were virtually zzso although it is proven zzso that the zzso convention has the least overall area zzso of all zzso 

The five zzso zzso conventions resulted in similar zzso zzso for all field shapes zzso The zzso zzso and zzso produced the more favorable approximation to conventional zzso The field zzso zzso although useful for evaluating irregular field shapes, could not describe the large local variations in the zzso along the field edge for the zzso These local variations could be of clinical concern when they appear near vital zzso However, the variation in a local region can potentially be reduced by minimizing the zzso of the leaf steps in that local zzso The zzso results were useful as guidelines for the clinicians in the evaluation and adjustment of zzso leaf zzso
