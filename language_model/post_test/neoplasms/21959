An important consideration in the development of T zzso cancer zzso is that zzso T cells must efficiently traffic to the tumor zzso in order to control zzso zzso T cell trafficking to target zzso is orchestrated by dynamic interactions between circulating zzso and zzso cells lining blood zzso It is zzso in this regard, to compare and contrast the molecular mechanisms governing zzso zzso at distinct vascular sites: zzso high zzso zzso zzso of secondary zzso zzso which are portals for efficient trafficking of zzso and central memory T zzso zzso zzso zzso of normal zzso that mediate relatively low zzso levels of trafficking but are rapidly transformed into zzso vessels in response to local inflammatory zzso and zzso vessels within the zzso region and the surrounding zzso zzso These vessels can be distinguished by differential expression of hallmark trafficking molecules that function as molecular zzso directing zzso migration across vascular zzso This article reviews evidence that recruitment of zzso T cells to the zzso zzso is zzso by zzso expression of trafficking molecules on tumor zzso Emerging data support the thesis that when considered from the perspective of zzso vessels embedded within the zzso zzso of established tumors do not exhibit stereotypical characteristics of a chronic inflammatory zzso A major challenge will be to develop therapeutic approaches to improve trafficking of zzso T zzso to tumor sites without skewing the balance in favor of a chronic inflammatory milieu that zzso tumor maintenance and zzso
