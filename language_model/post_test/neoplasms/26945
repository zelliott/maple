In previous research, we found zzso to be zzso correlated with zzso and overall survival in lung cancer patients and detected zzso on the surface of lung cancer zzso Based on these findings, we hypothesized that surface zzso has a significant role in cancer zzso and tested this hypothesis in the current zzso We found that zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in lung cancer cells and zzso with these proteins in a zzso dot zzso zzso which can be interrupted by zzso zzso zzso in lung cancer cells zzso with these proteins and was present at the site of zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso against zzso in zzso suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso collagen and gelatin degradation, and cell zzso zzso of the effect of treatment with zzso plasmids revealed that down regulation of zzso decreases zzso zzso degradation by and the invasion capacity of lung cancer zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso to mice resulted in zzso of zzso in subcutaneous tumor and inhibited the formation of tumor zzso in lung and zzso This study demonstrated that surface zzso promotes zzso zzso degradation and invasion of cancer cells and that targeting surface zzso is a promising approach to suppress tumor zzso
