Advances in understanding the molecular basis of human disease and the development of zzso DNA methods is rapidly creating new means of disease diagnosis and zzso Among the most revolutionary developments are technologies for transfer of therapeutic genes to the human body to treat both inherited and acquired zzso Gene therapy offers considerable promise for zzso otherwise intractable diseases such as zzso conditions, cancer, heart disease, and various zzso and neurodegenerative zzso To fulfill this promise, more efficient and effective methods of gene delivery and appropriate gene expression must be zzso The lack of such techniques is currently the most significant impediment to the use of genetic zzso Both viral and zzso delivery systems are under development for specific zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso represents a novel zzso system for gene delivery to the nervous system and other zzso zzso is able to establish zzso in zzso zzso cells in which zzso persist long-term but do not integrate or alter zzso metabolism and that carry a promoter system uniquely capable of escaping repression that shuts off the expression of zzso genes during zzso This review examines efforts to create defective zzso zzso that are safe, zzso and zzso to the treatment of cancer and diseases affecting peripheral zzso Perhaps the most important use of zzso zzso will be for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases of the brain, but additional studies are required to improve the design of promoters to ensure zzso or effective levels of therapeutic gene zzso
