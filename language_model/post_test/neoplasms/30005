This paper aims to evaluate the zzso properties of zzso a compound zzso isolated from algae zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso properties of zzso were investigated zzso zzso zzso to assess the zzso zzso flow zzso analysis to examine the cell cycle and zzso Western zzso analysis for determination of the expression of cell cycle and zzso zzso and study of zzso zzso growth in mice zzso mice bearing zzso zzso 

zzso exhibited a zzso effect, at least in part, by inducing cell cycle arrest in the zzso and the zzso zzso leading cells to zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso reduced the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A decrease in zzso and an increase in zzso zzso and zzso expression was also zzso In the zzso experiment, treatment with zzso was able to reduce zzso growth in zzso zzso 

zzso promotes a delay in the cell cycle, probably in the zzso transition, zzso the zzso process and this could be responsible, at least in part, for the zzso effects zzso Taken together, the zzso and zzso experiments suggested that zzso has zzso zzso Further studies should be conducted to clarify the mechanism of zzso
