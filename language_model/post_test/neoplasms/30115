zzso zzso is the first DNA zzso zzso inhibitor evaluated in zzso This work described the development and validation of an zzso method for quantitative determination of zzso in human zzso In this method, zzso and its stable isotope zzso zzso as internal zzso were directly zzso in human plasma with zzso The zzso zzso and IS were extracted by zzso zzso and separated zzso on a zzso zzso column zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso using an zzso mobile phase containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid at a flow rate of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was carried out by zzso zzso mode of positive zzso tandem mass zzso This method has been validated according to zzso guidelines for zzso zzso The linear zzso range for zzso was zzso zzso in human plasma with a correlation zzso The zzso and zzso precision zzso at three concentration levels zzso zzso and 450 zzso ranged zzso and zzso zzso The stability studies showed that zzso met the acceptable criteria under all tested zzso The method developed had been applied to the determination of plasma zzso zzso in the zzso phase I clinical trial, and zzso data were zzso
