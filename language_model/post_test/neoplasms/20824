zzso is the use of natural or synthetic compounds to block, reverse, or prevent the development of invasive zzso Cellular zzso forms the zzso basis for the identification of zzso assessment of their activity, and ultimately the success or failure of a zzso zzso agents undergo zzso evaluations to assess efficacy that are similar in concept but vastly different in practice to standard zzso zzso zzso In zzso assessments of potential zzso efficacy include zzso of an agent's zzso activity, induction of phase II zzso zzso and effects upon cellular proliferation and zzso control zzso In zzso efficacy is assessed primarily in zzso models of zzso that are specific for a given organ zzso The role of genetically modified animal models in the in zzso assessment of zzso agents remains zzso Clinical assessment of zzso agent efficacy consists of a zzso process of identification of an optimal zzso agent zzso 1), demonstration of efficacy in humans through the zzso of reversal of a zzso zzso and molecular surrogates for zzso transformation and invasion zzso 2) and cancer risk reduction in large cohort trials zzso zzso Opportunities and future needs include the development of reliable, zzso in zzso models of zzso careful exploration of the preventive pharmacology of therapeutic agents being used for zzso prevention zzso and the incorporation of genetic risk zzso to define cancer zzso zzso
