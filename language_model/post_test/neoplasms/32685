Growth factors and zzso initiate multiple signal zzso pathways that lead to cell survival, cell cycle progression or zzso A common feature of these pathways is increased cellular metabolism and zzso zzso Furthermore, the energy requirements of many zzso and transformed cell lines are met by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso among transforming events, zzso zzso and cell cycle progression are not well zzso Here we investigated the regulation of zzso transport during the cell cycle of growth zzso zzso cells, primary zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso were enriched in the zzso S and zzso zzso of the cell cycle, and zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso expression increased with cell volume as cells progressed through the cell zzso Growth zzso zzso cells and zzso were zzso by increased zzso zzso from zzso to S and reduced zzso at zzso with the highest specific activity of zzso in the S zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells and zzso cells showed increased zzso zzso from S to zzso with the highest zzso zzso specific activity in zzso Our results show that zzso transport is regulated in a cell zzso manner and suggest that this regulation may be altered in transformed zzso
