Class I major zzso complex zzso molecules form part of the target structure recognized by the host zzso T cells zzso to reject zzso zzso Many types of zzso zzso cells are reported in which expression of class I zzso genes is zzso By zzso gene transfer, it is possible to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso or to introduce zzso zzso zzso zzso class I zzso genes into these zzso zzso In both instances, the zzso of the zzso zzso cells is greatly enhanced and results in their rejection in zzso More importantly, these zzso zzso cells, which are positive for class I zzso zzso can simultaneously generate an immunity against the zzso zzso cells which do not express these zzso These observations suggest the distinct possibility of using gene transfer as a molecular zzso approach to abrogate zzso zzso
