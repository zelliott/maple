The availability of quality assured, zzso cancer zzso and zzso with high quality samples makes it possible to conduct research on large samples sets with long follow-up within a reasonable time zzso zzso quality for both cancer zzso and zzso is essential for enabling high quality zzso zzso Recent networking projects have brought these zzso together to promote the combined use of cancer zzso and zzso in cancer zzso 

In this report we review the current status and future perspectives of cancer zzso and zzso and how the interface between them should be developed to zzso further cancer zzso 

Major conclusions for future improvements are that the research exploiting cancer zzso and zzso and the research that is building and zzso the infrastructure, should evolve together for zzso relevant zzso zzso and sustainable zzso that continuously and zzso store all samples zzso zzso under strict quality control are zzso There is also a need for increased education, information and visibility of the interdisciplinary sciences required for optimal exploitation of these zzso
