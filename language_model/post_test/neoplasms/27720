We measured plasma zzso zzso II zzso zzso activity in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso due to various underlying diseases together with the levels of zzso III zzso zzso zzso (a marker of zzso zzso and various zzso molecular zzso Both HC II and AT III were decreased in zzso secondary to all the underlying diseases zzso except acute zzso leukemia zzso when compared with healthy zzso The lowest HC II and AT III levels was observed in zzso secondary to liver disease, the HC II level in zzso was the second zzso In zzso due to zzso the decrease in HC II was not accompanied by a decrease in AT zzso Thus, we divided all 124 samples tested into zzso and zzso zzso The HC II level correlated positively with zzso and zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso group, the HC II level had a significant negative correlation with the zzso III complex zzso zzso degradation products, and zzso levels as well as the zzso time, while AT III showed no correlations with any of the zzso zzso These results suggest that HC II may be consumed zzso by zzso in zzso patients with zzso and thus may spare the consumption of AT zzso zzso HC II seems to be a superior indicator of zzso than AT III in zzso zzso Moreover, replacement therapy with HC II instead of AT III may be useful to treat zzso associated with zzso In the zzso group, the HC II levels were positively correlated with the levels of AT III and zzso zzso This indicates that plasma HC II levels are closely related not only to consumption zzso but also to zzso synthetic activity, as is the case for plasma AT zzso
