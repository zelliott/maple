Our objectives were zzso to compare the disposition and in zzso release of zzso between a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in human subjects, and zzso to develop a zzso model for zzso and total zzso zzso 

A total of 35 patients zzso zzso zzso age: 59 zzso zzso with advanced zzso zzso were studied in a zzso zzso crossover zzso Patients received 175 zzso zzso as 15 zzso zzso zzso or 3 h zzso intravenous infusion in each study zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso in plasma zzso and whole zzso zzso VI was used for population zzso 

A linear disposition model with three compartments for zzso zzso and a zzso model for zzso were zzso Total clearance of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The prolonged release with zzso zzso was explained by the limited zzso of zzso zzso of 405 zzso zzso in zzso The 15 zzso zzso zzso infusion yielded a mean time to zzso cumulative input of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was estimated to release zzso of the dose directly into the deep peripheral zzso The model accounted for the presence of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso analysis indicated linear disposition and a potentially higher zzso of zzso zzso following zzso zzso administration due to direct release at the target zzso The prolonged release of zzso zzso supports 15 zzso zzso zzso This zzso model may be important for development of prolonged release zzso that distribute in and from the systemic zzso
