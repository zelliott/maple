zzso and zzso are tumor necrosis factor zzso members shown to be important for zzso development, maturation and zzso Recent data also indicate that these zzso regulate the survival and maintenance of zzso zzso in cancer zzso The key role of zzso in the immune system and their potential role in zzso have attracted the attention of basic zzso and biotechnology companies zzso As a result, the pathways regulated by zzso and zzso have been quickly elevated as attractive targets for zzso and zzso based zzso zzso of these pathways has not only given us enormous insights into the basic biology of the zzso system but it has also identified potential clinical candidates for cancer and zzso As such, multiple biotechnology companies are currently testing various therapeutic candidates in the zzso This chapter will review zzso and zzso functions and discuss alternative therapeutic approaches to target zzso and zzso pathways for human zzso and zzso
