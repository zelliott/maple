zzso a zzso zzso known to promote survival, invasion and zzso of tumor cells through multiple pathways and mechanisms, has been found to be zzso in various types of cancer zzso Here we report that loss of the function of zzso a tumor zzso protein that is zzso in approximately 50% of human zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso We observed an inverse association between the activity of zzso and the level of zzso protein in several cancer cell zzso We further demonstrated that zzso is able to zzso regulate zzso zzso but zzso of zzso by zzso is independent of repression of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso can be rescued by zzso a zzso zzso but not by zzso a zzso zzso suggesting an involvement of the zzso zzso in the zzso degradation of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso leads to a decrease in the activity of zzso and an zzso of tumor cell zzso Our study suggests that the zzso of zzso seen in many zzso can be attributed to, at least in part, the dysfunction of zzso and thus provides new evidence for the roles of zzso in tumor development and zzso
