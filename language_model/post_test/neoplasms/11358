The zzso effect in the zzso region for zzso zzso zzso fields was studied using a zzso 21 zzso linear zzso The beam profiles in the zzso and zzso directions for zzso field zzso of varying lengths of zzso leaves, which are adjacent (on one or both zzso to the beam profile zzso were measured using a 6 zzso zzso zzso It was found that there is a decrease of dose in the zzso region of the zzso zzso side in the zzso profile, when the zzso leaves zzso and/or lower zzso were moved out from zzso zzso to 3 zzso towards the central beam zzso When both the upper and lower portions of leaves were moved out forming a gap for the profile, the dose at the zzso region in the zzso direction was decreased by about zzso and zzso with the zzso length of leaves being zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso profile increased with the zzso length of leaves when the gap zzso was zzso zzso and it was independent of the length when the zzso was increased larger than 1 zzso The zzso treatment planning system could calculate the decrease of dose observed zzso in the zzso profile, but an zzso of about zzso was found when using version zzso which did not consider the leaf rounded end and zzso zzso While the newly commissioned zzso which considered the two aforementioned effects, made an improvement, it still underestimated the dose by zzso compared to the zzso For the zzso profiles, both versions estimated the zzso zzso zzso
