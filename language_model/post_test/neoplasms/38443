To advance cancer research in a transformative way, we must redefine the zzso Although zzso zzso such as breast cancer, may be caused by random zzso gene zzso the reality is that this is only one of many ways to induce tumor zzso zzso also can be produced in experimental systems in zzso and in zzso for example, by inducing sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, certain zzso zzso can be induced to zzso and zzso normal tissue zzso when combined with embryonic zzso or zzso zzso scaffolds that are produced through zzso zzso At the same time, work in the field of Mechanical Biology has revealed that many cell behaviors critical for cancer formation zzso growth, zzso zzso zzso can be controlled by physical interactions between cells and their zzso zzso that alter the mechanical force balance in the zzso cell and zzso zzso tumor progression also can be induced in zzso by changing zzso mechanics or altering zzso tension generation through manipulation of the zzso zzso signaling zzso Mechanical interactions between zzso cells and zzso that are zzso by zzso signaling similarly mediate control of zzso cell growth and zzso which are equally critical for cancer progression and zzso These findings question basic assumptions in the cancer field, and raise the intriguing possibility that cancer may be a zzso disease that results from progressive deregulation of tissue architecture, which leads to physical changes in cells and altered mechanical zzso This perspective raises the possibility of developing a tissue engineering approach to cancer therapy in which biologically inspired materials that mimic the embryonic zzso are used to induce zzso to zzso into normal zzso
