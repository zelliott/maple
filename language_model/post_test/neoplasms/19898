The vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in the growth and differentiation of zzso cells that are implicated in zzso zzso In this study, novel zzso were zzso and evaluated for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Three of these compounds showed good zzso zzso presenting low zzso values zzso zzso in zzso zzso showing also a significant proliferation zzso of zzso human zzso vein zzso cells zzso at low zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso not affecting cell zzso The determination of the total and zzso zzso zzso was performed by western zzso and it was possible to conclude that the compounds significantly inhibit the zzso of the zzso at 1 zzso pointing to their zzso mechanism of action in zzso The molecular rationale for zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso was also performed and discussed using molecular zzso zzso
