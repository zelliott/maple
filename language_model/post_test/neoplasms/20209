We used zzso at a dose of 7 zzso in patients with advanced cancer and compared the efficacy of this treatment to generate peripheral blood stem cells zzso with the previously reported regimen of zzso 4 zzso in a similar group of zzso None of these patients received zzso growth zzso Twenty-two patients received 7 zzso and 37 received 4 zzso zzso were collected by zzso after the zzso count recovered to zzso zzso zzso The yield of colony forming zzso zzso zzso was higher for the 7 zzso group with a median of 35 zzso zzso versus 15 zzso zzso body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso cell yield with medians of zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The percentage of patients achieving the minimum safe level of zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in the 7 zzso zzso group zzso than the 4 zzso zzso group zzso The duration of significant zzso was a median of 11 compared with nine days zzso zzso zzso and all patients receiving 7 zzso required admission to hospital and intravenous zzso therapy compared with zzso in the 4 zzso zzso There was one death during the period of zzso after zzso in each zzso zzso per cent of patients required zzso zzso after zzso 7 zzso compared with zzso after 4 zzso We conclude that the 7 zzso zzso gives a higher yield of zzso zzso cells than the 4 zzso but at increased clinical zzso
