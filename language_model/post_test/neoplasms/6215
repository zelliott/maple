zzso transition zzso is emerging as a driving force in tumor zzso enabling cancer cells to evade their zzso and to colonize remote zzso In this review, we focus on the emerging views dealing with a zzso control of zzso and with the importance of a zzso environment, both in cancer and zzso cells, to attain an improvement in tumor zzso 

The variety of signals able to promote zzso is large and continuously growing, ranging from soluble factors to components of the zzso zzso zzso evidence highlights zzso oxygen species zzso as crucial zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso exploits a fascinating role in ensuring zzso outcome within the primary zzso granting for the achievement of an essential selective advantage for cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are major players in this scenario, exerting a zzso role for zzso as well as for zzso zzso and dissemination of zzso zzso 

Future research focused on zzso should address some key points that are still zzso They include: zzso the role of the reverse phenomenon zzso zzso zzso that is likely regulated in the final stages of tumor zzso or that of zzso transition, a plasticity program of cancer cells, which often follows zzso and offers a further zzso advantage, and zzso the molecular basis of the correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
