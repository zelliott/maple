Maintenance of zzso integrity is crucial for the propagation of the genetic zzso zzso is a major component of the zzso complex, which controls once per cell cycle DNA zzso Upon DNA damage, zzso is rapidly targeted for zzso This targeting has been suggested to safeguard zzso integrity and prevent zzso while DNA repair is in zzso zzso is zzso in tumor zzso while its zzso expression is linked with zzso and promotes zzso in animal zzso The induction of zzso in DNA is a common mechanism by which many zzso zzso agents operate, leading to cell cycle arrest and zzso 

In the present study we examine the ability of several zzso drugs to target zzso for zzso We show that treatment of zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso lead to rapid zzso of zzso whereas treatment with zzso and zzso leave zzso expression zzso zzso affects zzso stability in zzso cells and not in zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso zzso in response to zzso depends on the presence of the sliding clamp zzso 

Our data suggest that treatment of tumor cells with commonly used zzso agents zzso differential responses with respect to zzso zzso Information on specific cellular targets in response to distinct zzso zzso drugs in different cancer cell types may contribute to the zzso of the efficacy of zzso
