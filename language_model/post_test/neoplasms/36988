Previous studies of zzso zzso zzso have been retrospective using multiple contributing zzso The purpose of this study was to determine zzso the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of benign, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and to determine if all clinical diagnoses require zzso confirmation, or if an experienced zzso can reliably distinguish benign from zzso zzso on the basis of history and clinical examination zzso 

This prospective study was conducted between January 1988 and January zzso All patients presenting during this time with zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated and a specific clinical diagnosis made in each case before biopsy and zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso as benign, zzso or zzso and zzso evaluation then correlated to determine the accuracy of the clinical zzso Only patients who presented without previous biopsy were eligible for inclusion in the zzso 

A biopsy was done on a total of 864 zzso zzso during the 85 month study zzso One hundred zzso zzso clinically were thought to represent zzso Of these, 140 zzso were found to have zzso zzso zzso zzso clinically were thought to represent zzso zzso zzso evaluation of these 19 zzso showed 16 to be actually zzso 1 to be a zzso and 2 to be zzso Six hundred zzso zzso clinically were thought to be zzso Of these, 13 zzso proved on zzso evaluation to be zzso These included 10 zzso cell zzso 1 zzso cell zzso 1 zzso lymphoma, and 1 zzso zzso zzso Three zzso of the zzso clinically benign zzso were found to be zzso The 13 missed zzso were distributed among a number of different clinical diagnoses, including zzso zzso inclusion cyst, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of the 153 clinically zzso zzso 6 zzso that clinically were highly suspicious for zzso had initial benign zzso zzso zzso results in all of these six subsequently confirmed the suspected zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso may zzso as a number of different clinically benign zzso The authors conclude that all excised zzso zzso should be submitted for zzso confirmation because it is not possible to obtain zzso accuracy in diagnosing zzso zzso on clinical grounds zzso However, strong clinical suspicion of a zzso is highly zzso and if initial zzso evaluation does not agree with the zzso clinical diagnosis, repeat biopsy should be zzso
