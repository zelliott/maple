The zzso acid content of alpha zzso zzso zzso and its degree of zzso were investigated in zzso isolated from the pooled zzso of patients with zzso arthritis, or zzso zzso or cancer zzso zzso or cancer zzso zzso and of healthy zzso zzso acid was elevated in zzso preparations from the cancer groups and lowered in the preparation from the zzso zzso All preparations showed considerable charge zzso by two zzso zzso gel zzso zzso but there was little evidence of molecular weight zzso the latter finding being also confirmed by zzso mapping zzso Each zzso preparation gave a different zzso zzso these differences were even more evident after partial zzso of the samples when as many as zzso different species could be zzso It is concluded from the zzso acid zzso and the zzso study that the different preparations of zzso contain zzso acid in different zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and silver zzso characteristic zzso patterns could also be demonstrated after separating very small zzso of zzso pooled and zzso zzso of the different zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in serum may have a useful future role in clinical zzso
