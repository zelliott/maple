The presence of zzso in the zzso fluid zzso of patients may be of diagnostic zzso However, the frequency with which zzso are shed into normal and abnormal human zzso is zzso This issue was studied using zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso The study was zzso conducted on 108 zzso preparations diagnosed as normal, zzso zzso zzso or suspicious for zzso zzso To validate these methods, cells from a zzso human zzso cell line, which contains zzso rich in zzso were processed in a manner identical to that used for the zzso obtained from zzso Studies of the human zzso cell line demonstrated intense zzso zzso in the majority of the zzso zzso In contrast, none of the zzso contained zzso zzso We conclude that zzso methods can detect zzso in zzso human zzso but that zzso zzso cells are uncommon in human zzso such cells were not seen in our large series of normal and abnormal human zzso The zzso detection of zzso may be a useful criterion for distinguishing zzso zzso from other types of zzso cells in human zzso
