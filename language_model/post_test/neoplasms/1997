Our recognition that cancer zzso by zzso selection and that the basis for this selection is the growth advantage provided by the inappropriate expression or suppression of genes present in all normal cells allows us to anticipate that the pathways of this evolutionary process may be zzso If a finite number of such pathways exist with some zzso between various tumors, there is the possibility to anticipate the mechanisms that cell clones might use for both zzso and tumor progression and to deal with evolving clones before their survival potential becomes zzso As our zzso understanding increases we may develop the capability to do the zzso to identify individuals who have inherited or acquired defective cancer zzso zzso to identify precursor zzso more zzso to characterize the degree of progression of a newly diagnosed tumor zzso the zzso zzso zzso to develop zzso against cell membrane proteins necessary to tumor zzso to produce immune zzso that carry zzso or zzso to specific cell zzso and to take advantage of cell signals to modify tumor zzso The potential for application of the New Biology to cancer medicine seems zzso
