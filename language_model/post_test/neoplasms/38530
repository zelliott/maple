The authors investigated the zzso of zzso zzso on frozen sections of various human zzso in 12 zzso tumors, and in 15 large cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso considered specifically directed against zzso associated with zzso included the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso in normal zzso and the tumor cells of the zzso zzso expressed these zzso in various zzso They were not zzso with zzso specific for zzso zzso cells, or zzso cells zzso zzso Out of these 13 zzso only the labeling by zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso was restricted to normal and zzso zzso In combination with their broad labeling of different types of zzso these zzso are of value in differential diagnostic purposes to distinguish zzso zzso from large cell zzso However, none of the 13 zzso can be considered as zzso zzso because they did not recognize all cell types belonging to the zzso zzso
