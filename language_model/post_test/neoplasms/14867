zzso zzso patients who require large amounts of zzso may benefit from sustained zzso dialysis performed continuously zzso zzso through higher clearance may improve survival, or through greater nutritional loss may zzso zzso No studies have assessed survival on zzso The objective was to examine patient outcomes and survival zzso on zzso 

The data of 199 consecutive cancer patients treated with zzso were zzso The median duration of zzso was 50 zzso With 48 h of zzso the blood zzso nitrogen zzso and serum zzso levels had decreased by zzso and zzso zzso The mean zzso pressure zzso was maintained despite higher zzso and reduced zzso zzso The zzso mortality rate was zzso Despite excellent dialysis, the sequential organ failure assessment zzso score remained zzso of zzso In the zzso model, higher zzso scores and lower values for zzso blood zzso and serum zzso and zzso levels were associated with higher zzso Administration of total zzso nutrition zzso was, however, associated with lower zzso 

In the zzso model, the higher zzso score and lower blood zzso zzso and zzso duration were associated with higher zzso In a subset analysis of 129 patients who received zzso for at least 48 zzso those with higher zzso levels, which were associated with higher zzso infusion, had a lower mortality zzso 

This first detailed report on zzso indicates that zzso can be effective and suggests a link between nutrition and zzso
