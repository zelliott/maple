We report an open, uncontrolled study designed to assess the effects of subcutaneous zzso zzso on zzso of terminal zzso Twenty patients with zzso caused by restrictive respiratory failure received an SC dose of zzso of 5 zzso (5 patients who were not receiving zzso or equivalent to zzso times their regular dose (15 patients who were receiving narcotics for zzso zzso zzso and pain (15 zzso were measured before the dose and every 15 zzso for 150 zzso after the injection using a visual analog scale zzso Respiratory rate zzso respiratory effort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined before and 45 zzso after SC zzso D, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were 68 zzso 32, 32 zzso 7; zzso zzso zzso 87 zzso 10, and 31 zzso 12, respectively, before SC zzso and 34 zzso 25 zzso less than zzso 31 zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 86 zzso 11 zzso and 33 zzso 9 zzso respectively, 45 zzso after SC zzso zzso of 20 patients zzso reported improved zzso after zzso We conclude that zzso appears to improve zzso without causing a significant deterioration in respiratory function in terminal cancer zzso zzso zzso controlled studies are needed in this zzso
