zzso zzso is a recent innovation in the field of zzso A zzso contains many small representative tissue samples from hundreds of different cases assembled on a single zzso slide, and therefore allows high zzso analysis of multiple specimens at the same zzso zzso zzso are zzso blocks produced by zzso zzso tissue zzso from different zzso donor blocks and zzso these into a single recipient zzso block at defined array zzso Using this technique, up to 1000 or more tissue samples can be arrayed into a single zzso zzso It can permit simultaneous analysis of molecular targets at the DNA, zzso and protein levels under zzso standardized conditions on a single glass slide, and also provide zzso preservation and use of limited and irreplaceable archival tissue zzso This versatile technique, in which data analysis is zzso zzso retrospective and prospective human tissue zzso It is a practical and effective tool for zzso molecular analysis of zzso that is helping to identify new diagnostic and zzso markers and targets in human zzso and has a range of potential applications in basic research, zzso zzso and drug zzso This article summarizes the technical aspects of tissue zzso construction and zzso advantages, application, and zzso
