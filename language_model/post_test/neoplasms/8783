The control and processing of zzso zzso is critical in the regulation of all cellular zzso Previous studies have suggested that a reduction in the expression of certain zzso or an overall decrease in zzso processing through the partial depletion of zzso can promote enhanced zzso zzso We show here that zzso depletion can promote the invasive behavior of cells that is reflected in enhanced recycling and zzso of the growth factor receptors Met and zzso zzso These responses are also seen in response to the expression of zzso zzso zzso and we show that zzso zzso can zzso zzso expression through both direct zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso control of zzso protein zzso Our results delineate a clear relationship between zzso zzso zzso and zzso that might contribute to the zzso function of zzso zzso but, interestingly, also reveal zzso functions of zzso zzso in controlling zzso zzso
