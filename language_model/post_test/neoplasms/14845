The PET Core Laboratory of the American College of zzso Imaging Network zzso qualifies sites to participate in zzso research trials by zzso reviewing submitted PET scans of uniform zzso to verify the accuracy of scanner standardized zzso value zzso zzso and zzso reviewing clinical PET images from each zzso To date, cylinder and patient data from 169 PET scanners have been zzso and 146 have been zzso 

Each site is required to submit data from 1 uniform cylinder and 2 patient test zzso zzso phantom data are analyzed by drawing a circular region of interest that encompasses approximately zzso of the diameter of the interior of the phantom and then recording the mean zzso and zzso of each zzso zzso In addition, average zzso are measured in the liver of submitted patient zzso These data illustrate variations of zzso across PET scanners and across institutions, and comparison of results with values submitted by the site indicate the level of experience of PET camera operators in calculating zzso 

Of 101 scanner applications for which detailed records of the zzso process were available, 12 zzso failed because of incorrect zzso or zzso zzso For sites to pass, the average cylinder zzso is required to be zzso zzso zzso The average zzso for uniform cylinder images for the most common scanners zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso GE Discovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso GE Discovery ST zzso zzso zzso zzso Philips zzso PET zzso zzso zzso and Philips zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the average liver zzso for submitted test cases were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso errors in zzso measurement is critical to achieving accurate zzso in clinical zzso The experience of the zzso PET Core Laboratory shows that many sites are unable to maintain accurate zzso zzso without additional training or zzso This raises concerns about using zzso to zzso patient data without zzso
