The zzso was evaluated by the in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test in 1,000 human tumors including 237 gastric zzso 116 zzso zzso 113 zzso and zzso zzso These tumor cells were exposed to 5 kinds of zzso drugs, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso After exposure to the zzso drugs, cell viability was assessed with zzso zzso based on the ability of zzso zzso zzso in living tumor cells to reduced a zzso zzso to a zzso The zzso was determined to be positive when the zzso activity of drug exposed cells decreased to below 50% of that of control cells, on day 3 of zzso The zzso varied in the tumor zzso The zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso were higher than that of the primary zzso while zzso liver tumors had lower sensitivity than the primary zzso The zzso distribution of zzso activity in 12 human gastric zzso were compared with normal adjacent zzso using zzso Seventy-five % zzso of gastric cancer zzso had higher zzso activity than normal adjacent zzso The zzso test is rapid and simple method to predict the sensitivity test of various human tumors to zzso zzso
