Cancer zzso is a zzso syndrome zzso by zzso loss of weight, loss of zzso zzso zzso fatigue and reduced performance zzso A significant number of patients with advanced cancer develop zzso before zzso There is no identified optimum treatment for cancer zzso While the exact mechanism of the action of zzso is zzso it is known to have zzso and zzso properties, which are thought to help reduce the weight loss associated with zzso zzso studies of zzso have demonstrated encouraging zzso 

This review aimed to zzso evaluate the effectiveness of zzso and zzso identify and assess adverse effects from zzso for cancer zzso 

Electronic searches were undertaken in zzso zzso zzso Web of Science and zzso (from inception to April zzso zzso lists from reviewed articles, trial zzso relevant conference documents and zzso manufacturers identified additional zzso 

This review included zzso controlled trials zzso and zzso Participants were adults diagnosed with advanced or incurable cancer and weight loss or a clinical diagnosis of zzso who were administered zzso 

All titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching were downloaded to a reference management zzso zzso were removed and the remaining citations were read by two review authors and checked for zzso Studies that were deemed ineligible for inclusion had clear reasons for exclusion zzso Data were extracted independently by two review authors for all eligible zzso While a zzso was planned for this review, this was not possible due to the small number of studies included and high zzso among zzso Thus a narrative synthesis of the findings is zzso 

The literature search revealed a dearth of large, well conducted trials in this zzso This has hindered the review zzso ability to make an informed decision about zzso for the management of cancer zzso At present, there is insufficient evidence to zzso or support the use of zzso for the management of zzso in advanced cancer zzso 

The review authors cannot confirm or zzso previous literature on the use of zzso for patients with advanced cancer who have zzso and there is inadequate evidence to recommend it for clinical zzso zzso well conducted, large zzso are needed to test zzso both singularly and in combination with other treatment zzso to ascertain its true benefit, if any, for this zzso Furthermore, one study (out of the three zzso highlighted that zzso was poorly tolerated and its use needs to be explored further in light of the frailty of this zzso
