It is clear that the risk of toxicity to normal zzso in combined therapy is reduced by separating drug administration and radiation exposure in zzso The short-term interaction of drugs and radiation aimed at producing enhanced zzso cell kill is difficult to demonstrate in zzso in animal experiments and unlikely to be important in clinical zzso Increased toxicity of normal zzso in man has been manifest both in terms of early and late reactions and probably also in zzso In the latter context choice of drug and possibly sequencing may be important in zzso the risk of zzso zzso There are few experimental studies examining moderately long time intervals between drug and radiation zzso The administration of chemotherapy prior to zzso may be less toxic than the converse zzso although clinical data supporting this contention are limited at the present zzso
