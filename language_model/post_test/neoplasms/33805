The ability of tumor cells to develop simultaneous resistance to multiple zzso zzso compounds represents a major problem in cancer zzso This review describes recent molecular biological studies which resulted in the identification and cloning of the gene responsible for zzso resistance in human tumor zzso This zzso designated zzso is zzso in all and amplified in many of the zzso cell lines zzso Gene transfer and expression zzso have indicated that the zzso gene is both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso The product of the zzso gene is zzso a zzso protein which shares zzso with several bacterial proteins involved in active membrane zzso zzso appears to function as an zzso zzso pump responsible for the removal of drugs from zzso zzso The functions of the zzso system in normal cells and its potential clinical implications are zzso
