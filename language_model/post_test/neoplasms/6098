zzso resistance zzso is the main cause of failure in cancer zzso One mechanism responsible for zzso is the active zzso of drugs by zzso cassette (ABC) zzso Several agents have been developed to block zzso drug zzso and some of these compounds have entered Phase zzso clinical zzso Evidence is also emerging of the role played by ABC zzso in cancer cell zzso that is likely to be important in disease progression and which is distinct from zzso 

This article reviews current literature to zzso the rationale for targeting ABC zzso in zzso zzso and clinical results of ABC zzso zzso in early clinical trials, as single agents or in combination with other drugs, are zzso The development of new strategies to target zzso and the emerging roles of ABC zzso in cancer zzso are zzso 

The intense active search for safe and effective zzso of ABC zzso has led to some success in zzso reversal in zzso zzso However, there has been little impact on clinical zzso The discovery of novel, potent and nontoxic zzso as well as new treatment strategies is therefore zzso
