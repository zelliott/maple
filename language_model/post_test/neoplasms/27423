Despite the zzso evidence linking obesity and cancer, there has never been a zzso zzso We believe the chronic inflammation present in obesity may zzso the obese to cancer through zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and elevated zzso zzso zzso in tumors affecting the zzso zzso 

zzso from 25 patients having gastric bypass surgery were compared to 15 normal controls preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months zzso using flow zzso to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression on T zzso B zzso natural killer cells, and zzso 

The percentage of zzso + T cells was significantly elevated from controls zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso This difference persisted through 1 month zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso per cell, was significantly greater in these patients than that of the controls zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and this continued to 1 zzso zzso cells also displayed a similar zzso in zzso zzso expression preoperatively zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso which zzso by 3 zzso Natural killer cells did not display elevated numbers of zzso zzso zzso but they did experience a significant decline by 12 zzso Additionally, there was significant reduction in the number of zzso cells zzso cells without zzso zzso when compared to zzso preoperatively zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso There was no statistical difference between the zzso patients and the controls by 3 zzso zzso was not different at baseline from controls in T or B cells, but there was a significant decrease by 12 zzso 

The reduced expression of zzso combined with the elevated levels of zzso suggests that zzso obesity zzso patients to sites of immune zzso This could be the mechanism for increased rates of cancer and wound infections seen in zzso zzso weight loss eliminates these risk zzso
