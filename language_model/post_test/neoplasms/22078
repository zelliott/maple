A zzso model of solid tumor growth based on deterministic zzso law is zzso zzso cells evolution is described by a one-dimensional diffusion process limited by two absorbing boundaries representing healing threshold and patient death zzso zzso zzso Via a zzso approach the first exit time problem is zzso for the process inside the region restricted by the zzso The proposed model is also implemented to simulate the effects of a zzso zzso Finally, some zzso results are obtained for the specific case of a zzso zzso
