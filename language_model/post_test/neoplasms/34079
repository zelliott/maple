There have been some observations that low body weight and a low level of some hormones zzso zzso during the first half of life are zzso of longer life in zzso However, contradictions in the available data on the zzso of aging and zzso of longevity have shown that the research in these fields has become a controversial zzso In our study we addressed the following questions: zzso Can particular zzso parameters zzso weight, food zzso zzso function, body temperature, zzso of zzso aberrations in bone zzso zzso measured at the age of 3 and 12 months be a predictor of longevity and the rate of tumor development in five strains of zzso zzso Can a heavy body weight at the age of 3 and 12 months be a predictor of longevity and high tumor risk in five strains of zzso Mice of five zzso zzso zzso zzso and transgenic zzso zzso under observation from the age of 2-3 months until natural zzso Body weight and temperature, food consumption, and zzso cycle were zzso studied in all zzso zzso discovered at autopsy were studied zzso We calculated the life zzso parameters zzso zzso mortality rate, mortality rate doubling zzso as well as their correlation with other parameters zzso The longest living zzso mice have the lowest body weight at the ages of 3 and 12 months, the lowest food consumption, body temperature, zzso of zzso aberrations and spontaneous tumor zzso In comparison with all other mouse strains they also have the latest disturbances in zzso function and highest body weight zzso The shortest living transgenic zzso mice have the lowest weight at the ages of 12 months, the lowest body weight gain, zzso body temperature, the most rapid disturbances in zzso function and the highest zzso of zzso aberrations and tumor zzso in comparison to all other mouse zzso Our findings have shown that heavier body weight at the age of 12 months is a predictor of longevity in female zzso and zzso mice but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso body weight at the ages of 3 or 12 months is not a predictor of increased tumor risk in the strains zzso In general, the existence and direction of a significant correlation between body weight and life span depends upon the zzso age and zzso
