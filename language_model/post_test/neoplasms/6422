The effects of zzso and charges of zzso zzso upon their interactions with membrane model systems are zzso Four zzso steps are evidenced from zzso zzso studies of zzso IX and its more zzso parent compound lacking of alcoholic chain, zzso zzso They are attributed to the successive zzso of the inner zzso of the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso and successive zzso of zzso groups zzso approximately equal to zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso These zzso as well as their zzso zzso forms, are shown to incorporate as zzso into the zzso zzso of egg zzso small zzso zzso although the zzso forms are highly zzso in zzso zzso In the case of the zzso forms, the incorporation of the zzso into the zzso zzso is zzso and strongly zzso A theoretical model is presented which takes into account the various zzso steps and the partition zzso of the zzso between the zzso zzso phase and the water zzso The neutral form of the zzso zzso zzso groups zzso presents the higher zzso with zzso of K approximately equal to 2 X zzso and K approximately equal to 6 X zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso of one inner nitrogen leading to the zzso form is sufficient to prevent incorporation into the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of the peripheral zzso chains leading to zzso forms is less zzso These interactions between zzso and zzso lead to shifts of the apparent zzso of zzso and zzso groups, the latter one being now in the range of zzso zzso These results are discussed with regards to the hypothesis of a possible role of pH in the preferential zzso of zzso by zzso
