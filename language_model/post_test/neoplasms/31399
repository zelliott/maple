zzso modification of tumor cells with the gene for the zzso or with the genes for zzso results in increased tumor cell zzso In the work reported here, zzso of zzso animals with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso tumor cells effectively protects the host from subsequent challenge with parental zzso The same treatment fails to induce zzso of established tumors, although zzso zzso are generated in the zzso zzso In contrast, a large tumor burden of the zzso zzso can be successfully eliminated by treatment with zzso tumor cells zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso immunity induced by the zzso is primarily dependent on zzso T cells and partly on zzso T cells and zzso cells, and the enhanced therapeutic effect may be attributed to the in zzso increase of zzso precursors following zzso The zzso and zzso genes must be expressed on the same tumor cell for optimal therapeutic zzso Our results suggest that tumor vaccines with a potent zzso effect do not necessarily have therapeutic potential and that zzso zzso tumors may be rendered highly zzso by zzso with the genes for zzso and zzso
