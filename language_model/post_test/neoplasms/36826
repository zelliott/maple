zzso detection and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are usually performed zzso at the computer zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a standardized film documentation as an alternative zzso 

100 zzso without zzso correction were analyzed with regard to number and zzso of zzso suspicious of zzso A standardized documentation on film was developed including zzso zzso slices of the brain, zzso zzso slices and zzso zzso of the zzso region and zzso of the trunk and zzso zzso of the zzso These zzso were analyzed at the light zzso An additional analysis on the computer display was performed slice by slice in zzso zzso and zzso directions for the whole zzso 

A total of 315 zzso were detected in 100 zzso In zzso patients the two zzso agreed both in number and zzso of zzso zzso 7 zzso in the legs of 3 patients didn't show when interpreting the films zzso zzso In zzso patients additional analysis on the computer display caused a change in the zzso of zzso zzso 8 of these were located in the zzso When adding zzso slices for the documentation of the lower zzso all the zzso were zzso Moreover, all zzso were localized correctly except one clinically zzso change of zzso out of a total of zzso zzso 

The newly developed standardized documentation supports the concept of film reading and reporting of zzso zzso restricting an additional zzso analysis to rare cases zzso Furthermore, the intention of the zzso zzso zzso group zzso are met, zzso to ease analysis of follow-up studies acquired at different zzso
