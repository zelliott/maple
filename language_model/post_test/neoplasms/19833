In this study, an attempt has been made with the advent of technology to prepare a zzso zzso (NBC) for targeted drug delivery in cancer zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso as zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso by incorporating iron oxide zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso and loading an zzso zzso drug zzso This NBC was characterized by conventional methods and evaluated for its biological zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso studies revealed the zzso to protein ratio and revealed the presence of iron oxide zzso and their interaction with the collagen zzso zzso While zzso showed the zzso nature of zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed magnetic zzso as zzso and a magnetic zzso with a diameter in the range of zzso and the dimension of zzso ranging from 97 to zzso A zzso scan has shown a super zzso effect, which reveals that the prepared NBC can be used as a zzso contrast zzso The zzso zzso has shown zzso and an zzso effect while phase contrast zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

The novelty in the prepared NBC lies in the collagen zzso which have a higher penetrating property without causing much cell damage, zzso and zzso properties and is able to carry zzso zzso 

The study has demonstrated the possible use of zzso as a zzso NBC for biomedical zzso
