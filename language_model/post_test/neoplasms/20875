Modern zzso techniques have developed to a point where the ability to conform to a particular zzso shape is limited by organ motion and zzso zzso The result is that dose zzso displayed by treatment planning systems based on zzso beam zzso are not representative of the dose received by the patient during a zzso course of zzso The zzso method to account for these variations in radiation treatment planning systems has been suggested in previous zzso The zzso of the zzso method is tested by comparing the dose distribution obtained from this zzso method with the dose distribution obtained by summing the contribution to the total dose from each fraction of a zzso treatment (for increasing numbers of zzso and simulating random target position variations between zzso For larger numbers of zzso zzso or zzso zzso which are the norm for radical treatment schemes, it is clear that incorporation of movement by a zzso method could potentially produce a more accurate dose zzso There are some limitations that have been identified, however, especially in relation to the zzso nature of patient zzso which require further investigation before the technique could be applied zzso
