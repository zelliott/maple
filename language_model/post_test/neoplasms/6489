We have zzso in zzso zzso cells, the effect on DNA of zzso (a zzso of zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of zzso The treatment results in release of zzso DNA fragments zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso When DNA from synchronized zzso cells in S phase is zzso almost all zzso DNA appears as short zzso However, fragmentation does not occur in zzso cells or in normal zzso Furthermore, fragmentation can be prevented by zzso cells in excessive amounts of zzso Hence zzso and the zzso protein zzso are involved in the processes zzso stability to DNA in zzso zzso zzso
