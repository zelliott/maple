In this work was to evaluate the zzso activity of a series of zzso group 3 and zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso Y zzso La zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having zzso geometry around the metal atoms on the human zzso lung zzso zzso human melanoma zzso human cervical zzso zzso human embryonic kidney zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

All the tested compounds were incubated with cells for 72 h and their growth zzso assessed by using zzso zzso 

On the cell line zzso complexes 5 and 7 show a reasonable activities, while the zzso zzso cell line zzso only the zzso 2 complex is not very zzso All complexes tested are poorly active on human health zzso lung zzso zzso and human melanoma zzso 

The group 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso cell line, except that of zzso show a reasonable zzso On human zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes 3, 5 and 6 are significantly more active than zzso as well as complex 5 is more active on human embryonic kidney zzso cell zzso All the tested complexes are poorly active on human zzso lung zzso zzso and human melanoma zzso The different zzso of the complexes examined zzso let us zzso that the zzso activity is related to the zzso as a whole and not only to the zzso or the metal zzso zzso
