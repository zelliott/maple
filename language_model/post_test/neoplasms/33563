Severe cancer pain was relieved by a simple zzso zzso Its injecting power is derived from the decomposition and expansion of zzso zzso hydrogen zzso The injection speed is controlled by the addition of a zzso of zzso zzso which zzso the hydrogen zzso The amount of zzso zzso used is so small that decomposition and expansion speeds are nearly zzso The size of the power device is 1 zzso it may be inserted into the zzso which then does not need a zzso any zzso This means that this zzso with the solution to be injected is only half the size of an ordinary zzso zzso It is convenient for zzso zzso of zzso cancer zzso
