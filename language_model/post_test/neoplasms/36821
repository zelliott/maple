zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human tumors have been shown to produce zzso zzso levels of zzso have been detected in zzso of cancer patients, but its origin is zzso We analyzed zzso zzso in serum, zzso whole blood, and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and zzso in 56 cancer patients and 52 healthy controls using zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso whole blood samples zzso zzso zzso were higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso The highest zzso values were found in zzso zzso In cancer patients, a high zzso concentration was associated with a high peripheral blood zzso count zzso zzso zzso and zzso count zzso zzso zzso In healthy individuals, a high zzso was associated with a high zzso count zzso zzso zzso but not with the zzso count zzso The cancer patients regularly had higher zzso zzso than healthy individuals with comparable zzso or zzso zzso The zzso content of isolated zzso and zzso was zzso higher in cancer patients than in healthy controls zzso zzso versus zzso zzso per zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated strongly zzso Very little or no zzso was found in the zzso The results indicate that zzso in the zzso is transported by blood cells, including zzso and zzso The blood cells of cancer patients contain greatly elevated amounts of this major zzso growth factor, and this zzso of zzso may have a role in tumor zzso and zzso zzso zzso in serum samples originates from blood cells, and the use of zzso of whole blood or of isolated blood cells may improve the clinical value of zzso zzso
