The magnetic guidance and capture of particles inside the human body, via the circulatory system, is a novel method for the targeted delivery of zzso This experimental study confirms in zzso that a zzso capturing device, based on zzso magnets with an active space of zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 10 zzso retains zzso magnetic particles zzso zzso zzso injected in the zzso tubes, where flow zzso are comparable to that encountered in the zzso beds of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the deposition of the zzso was investigated using video imaging techniques that enabled continuous monitoring of the blocking of the vessel whilst simultaneously recording the zzso flow zzso The parameters of practical importance zzso of zzso zzso time of zzso zzso were estimated and were found to be dependent on the initial fluid zzso the zzso concentration and the distance between the zzso tube and the polar magnetic zzso Although the tube used in this experiment is larger zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso 100 zzso than that of real zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length approximately zzso zzso the flow zzso chosen were similar to those encountered in the zzso beds of zzso and the zzso ratio was approximately equal zzso for the present zzso zzso for real zzso In these circumstances and using the same magnetic field conditions zzso zzso and zzso there is close similarity with magnetic capture in a microscopic zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso system permits analysis of the distribution of zzso in the active magnetic space, and consequently the maximum zzso zzso This study revealed that the capture of particles within the active space was strongly influenced by the zzso of the magnetic field and the flow zzso Thus, when the magnetic field zzso had medium values zzso T zzso and the fluid zzso was small zzso zzso zzso the particles were captured in small, compact and stable deposits zzso zzso 4 zzso and the time necessary for blocking of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso the value for the flow zzso did not influence significantly either the length of zzso deposits nor the blocking zzso However, lower zzso zzso T zzso and larger zzso zzso zzso zzso result in the formation of larger deposits (4 zzso zzso L zzso 10 zzso that are unstable at the beginning of the capture zzso These large deposits do become stable given sufficient time for the deposition process to take place in conjunction with a decrease in the flow zzso As a consequence, the time necessary for blocking of the zzso increased up to 450 zzso zzso the zzso concentration from zzso g zzso to zzso g zzso decreased the deposit lengths by approximately zzso and doubled the values of the blocking zzso The maximum zzso volume obtained by the present method is approximately 350 zzso which zzso to zzso zzso The zzso vessels were blocked only for the situation that occurs for zzso within a zzso This reduces the concentration of zzso trapped within the normal zzso which occurs when using particles of zzso zzso This work showed the potential of using zzso zzso and zzso magnetic devices for treatment of human patients, when the affected sites are positioned at medium distances from the surface of the body zzso head, neck, breast, hands and zzso
