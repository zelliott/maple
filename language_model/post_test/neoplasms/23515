zzso zzso is highly prevalent in hospital patients and varies from zzso Early nutritional screening of patients at admission helps to improve recognition of zzso patients to allow early interventions and enhance clinical zzso 

A total of 104 zzso surgical patients with zzso zzso stomach zzso or pancreatic cancer zzso were recruited in our zzso The risk of zzso was examined using the zzso zzso Universal zzso zzso zzso zzso data and information on percent weight change over the past six months, unintentional weight loss, dietician zzso and history of nutritional intervention were zzso 

A total of zzso of our participants were at high zzso risk with a mean zzso percentage weight loss of zzso zzso despite a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso Participants with a significantly higher percent weight loss, unintentional weight loss, dietician referral and nutritional intervention had a higher risk of zzso zzso zzso of unintentional weight loss was the only significant predictor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with risk of zzso after adjusted for all zzso 

In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of routine screening of zzso in zzso zzso Medical personnel must be aware that unintentional weight loss is an important predictor of zzso risks even if the zzso zzso is not suggestive of zzso
