Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso evaluation does not take into account the zzso tumor zzso and may provide incomplete information about experimental drug zzso zzso growth rate zzso allows for a dynamic and quantitative assessment of the tumor zzso How zzso varies along the introduction of experimental zzso and is associated with outcome in phase I patients remains zzso 

Medical records from all patients (N zzso zzso zzso treated in 20 phase I trials were zzso zzso was zzso during the zzso period zzso and the experimental zzso zzso between zzso standard zzso scores zzso Marsden Hospital zzso zzso and outcome zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso were zzso zzso zzso 

We observed a reduction of zzso between the reference versus experimental periods zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Although most patients were classified as stable disease zzso or progressive disease zzso by zzso at the first zzso zzso and zzso of them exhibited a decrease in zzso zzso In a zzso analysis, only the decrease of zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso score was the only variable associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Only the investigated regimens delivered were associated with a decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles across different clinical trials reveals specific patterns of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in phase I patients is simple and provides clinically relevant information: zzso an early and subtle assessment of signs of zzso zzso zzso independent association with zzso and zzso it reveals zzso profiles, suggesting potential utility for guiding the further development of the zzso zzso
