The possibility that magnetic fields zzso cause zzso activity in zzso has been zzso Two different experiments have been carried out on nude mice bearing a subcutaneous human colon zzso zzso In the first experiment, significant increase in survival time zzso was obtained in mice exposed daily to 70 zzso modulated zzso zzso with a zzso of 50 zzso having a time average total intensity of zzso zzso In the second independent experiment, when mice bearing tumors were exposed to the same treatment for four consecutive weeks, significant zzso of tumor growth zzso was reported, together with a zzso in tumor cell zzso index and zzso zzso A significant increase in zzso was found in tumors of treated animals, together with a reduction in zzso zzso zzso Gross pathology at zzso zzso and zzso examination did not show any adverse or abnormal zzso Since pharmacological rescue of zzso zzso zzso has been recently demonstrated, the authors suggest that zzso exposure may obtain a similar effect by acting on zzso chemistry connected to metal zzso which control zzso folding and its zzso zzso These findings support further investigation aimed at the potential use of magnetic fields as zzso zzso
