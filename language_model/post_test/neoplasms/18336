Many risk factors have been associated with cancer, such as age, family history, race, smoking, high-fat diet, and poor zzso It is important to reveal the molecular changes related to risk factors that could facilitate early zzso zzso and overall control of zzso 

We selected six zzso zzso genes that have previously been reported in primary tumors and have also been detected in different bodily zzso of cancer zzso Here, we used quantitative zzso real-time zzso zzso in plasma DNA samples for the detection of zzso changes from an zzso population who do not have any known zzso 

The promoter zzso zzso of the studied genes were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of at least one of the genes analyzed was observed in approximately zzso zzso of zzso of the samples by zzso zzso zzso zzso of at least two genes was detected in zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso of subjects who had a high-fat diet in contrast with those who had a low-fat diet zzso P zzso zzso 

Our findings may help to zzso early zzso changes that may lead to cancer zzso These zzso changes could be due to exposure to risk factors and may be useful for cancer prevention measures such as changes in zzso zzso follow-up of a high-risk population is needed to understand the association of zzso of candidate genes in cancer zzso
