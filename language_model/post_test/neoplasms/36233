Hollow zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as cores, so-called zzso zzso zzso have attracted great research zzso However, a highly efficient, simple and general way to produce zzso shell zzso with zzso functional zzso and shell compositions is still a great zzso A zzso general and zzso strategy has been developed for zzso zzso zzso and highly uniform zzso zzso under mild conditions, composed of zzso shells and diverse functional zzso zzso with different compositions and zzso These zzso can be zzso zzso gold zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso shell zzso with magnetic, zzso and zzso fluorescent zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso with zzso interior hollow spaces and zzso shell thickness can be precisely zzso More importantly, zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso as an example for simultaneous targeted zzso imaging and zzso guided drug delivery to liver cancer cells is also zzso This synthetic approach can be easily extended to the fabrication of zzso zzso shell zzso that zzso various functional zzso zzso cores, which construct a potential platform for the simultaneous targeted delivery of zzso and zzso
