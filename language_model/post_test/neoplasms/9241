A novel rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed as the shielding zzso The zzso zzso zzso with zzso charged at physical pH can act as the shielding system to shield positively charged zzso zzso was used to shield zzso to form zzso zzso the zzso surface zzso potential can change from a negative to positive nearly pH value of zzso Because the pH value of tumor zzso environment is about zzso the positive charges on the zzso could be restored in tumors, which is beneficial to the zzso interactions between positive zzso and negative tumor cells, leading to high cell zzso efficiency and high zzso zzso
