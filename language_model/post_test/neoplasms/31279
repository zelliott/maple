zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been used as an zzso for nearly thirty years in zzso It zzso the binding of zzso to cell surface receptors and has thus been evaluated for zzso activity in several animal models and human tumor cell zzso In two zzso models zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso stimulation of zzso Previous clinical studies have determined the zzso effects of zzso to be the zzso zzso 

We conducted a phase I study designed to define the zzso toxicity associated with progressive zzso of a continuous intravenous infusion zzso five, and eight zzso This study was not designed to escalate the dose of zzso beyond that required to maintain the activated partial zzso time zzso between zzso and zzso times the baseline zzso 

Thirteen patients with advanced stage zzso cancer were enrolled zzso age 50 years, range 34 to 61 zzso Four patients were treated in cohort zzso (three weeks of zzso zzso five patients were treated in cohort zzso (five weeks of zzso and four patients in cohort zzso zzso weeks of zzso All patients experienced a progressive zzso of their zzso and zzso Furthermore, all patients experienced at least grade I zzso Other complications were, in general, zzso One patient developed grade III liver abnormalities while receiving the eight-week infusion and another patient developed grade IV zzso while receiving the same zzso One patient with colon cancer had stable disease for 24 weeks, while the remaining 12 patients had no objective evidence of zzso 

zzso was well tolerated when doses were adjusted for zzso zzso and a five-week cycle appeared to be the maximum tolerated duration of infusion zzso 4 zzso One patient had stable disease, but there was no objective tumor response noted in the remaining 12 zzso
