zzso of zzso is associated with worse prognosis for a number of cancer zzso The present study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso when administered to patients with zzso zzso 

Sixteen patients with advanced solid tumors zzso to standard therapies were treated with escalating doses of zzso zzso zzso intravenous infusion given every 14 days, with a zzso intravenous infusion of zzso administered on day 5 of each zzso zzso plasma samples were collected to calculate the zzso of zzso and zzso and also to measure the effect of zzso on zzso zzso 

7 women and 9 men, median age 55 years zzso zzso zzso received a zzso infusion of zzso at dose levels of 5 zzso zzso zzso 4) or 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso On the 5th day of the infusion, zzso was given at 10 zzso for a total dose of 1,000 zzso zzso zzso 7; zzso I and zzso 1,200 zzso zzso zzso 3; cohort zzso or 1,500 zzso zzso zzso 6; cohort zzso zzso was the zzso toxicity zzso zzso expansion of cohort zzso No subsequent zzso were zzso Thus, the maximum planned doses were well zzso and a formal zzso was not zzso Most zzso zzso were grade 1 or zzso There was zzso fatigue, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased in relation to the dose zzso but zzso zzso levels did not correlate well with zzso There were no objective responses, though 5 patients had stable zzso A zzso reduction in zzso expression in peripheral blood zzso zzso was seen more frequently in patients who achieved stable disease than in progressing zzso 

The zzso planned dose levels of zzso and zzso in combination were well zzso Only one zzso zzso zzso There was a correlation between zzso reduction and stable zzso The recommended doses of the drugs for future studies are 7 zzso of zzso on days zzso and zzso 1,500 zzso on day 5, every two zzso
