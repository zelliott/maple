The therapeutic use of the immune system to attack cancer cells has been a longstanding vision among zzso zzso However, most human zzso are poorly zzso and are able to invade the host immune zzso Although these obstacles are clearly critical to cancer vaccine development, the induction of a strong zzso immune response may rely on the zzso of high affinity T cells through a molecular mimicry mechanism which involves zzso recognition of foreign zzso mimicking the structure of zzso zzso Taking into account the disparity in zzso molecules needed to present shared zzso in late 1990s zzso et zzso described the possibility of generating zzso high affinity zzso T cells against synthetic zzso bound to zzso zzso In addition to the strategies indicated above, the zzso of the zzso mechanisms associated with zzso invasion of the immune system using zzso interference also offers a new approach to vaccine zzso This review highlights the problem of immune zzso the induction of zzso T cells, and describes strategies to enhance zzso zzso
