A distinguishing zzso of solid tumors is the presence of an alkaline cellular feature despite the surrounding zzso zzso This zzso characteristic of tumors, originally described by Otto zzso arises due to zzso in metabolism of solid zzso zzso regions of solid tumors develop due to poor zzso and in turn regulate the expression of numerous genes via the zzso factor zzso Ultimately, the tumor zzso directs the development of tumor cells adapted to survive in an zzso surrounding where normal cells zzso The provision of unique pH characteristics in tumor cells provides a defining trait that has led to the pursuit of treatments that target zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms to selectively kill cancer zzso Numerous studies over the past decade involving the zzso zzso zzso IX have zzso an interest in pH zzso zzso Although an zzso of the zzso compartment is established as a means to induce normal cell death, the defining role of zzso disturbances in tumor physiology and survival remains zzso The aim of this review is to zzso recent data relating to the specific role of pH regulation in tumor cell zzso We focus on membrane transport and zzso studies in an attempt to zzso their respective functions regarding tumor cell pH zzso These data are discussed in the context of future directions for the field of tumor cell zzso zzso
