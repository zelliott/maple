The zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the drug resistance of a solid tumor by preventing the penetration of therapeutic zzso We measured differences in zzso resistance to zzso zzso motion in four tumor types and found an unexpected correspondence between transport resistance and the mechanical zzso The zzso diffusion zzso of zzso was measured in zzso by zzso zzso after zzso zzso elastic zzso and zzso zzso were measured by confined zzso of excised zzso In apparent contradiction to an existing zzso these functional properties are correlated with total tissue content of zzso not zzso An extended collagen network was observed in the more zzso zzso zzso treatment of the more zzso tumors significantly increased the zzso zzso diffusion zzso We conclude that collagen influences the tissue resistance to zzso zzso possibly by binding and stabilizing the zzso component of the zzso These findings suggest a new method to screen tumors for potential resistance to zzso zzso Moreover, collagen and zzso bonds are identified as potential targets of treatment to improve zzso zzso
