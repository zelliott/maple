The heat response of five human tumor zzso has been examined using the fluorescent probe zzso zzso and zzso flow zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to possess specificity for heat killed zzso zzso The human tumors tested included a cervical zzso cell zzso zzso melanoma, colon zzso zzso zzso and a zzso The samples were zzso mechanically disrupted into single cell suspensions and heated in zzso for various lengths of time at 45 degrees zzso The cells were returned to 37 degrees C incubation for 12 to 15 hours prior to zzso with zzso zzso The fraction of cells zzso zzso zzso was zzso by flow zzso after gating on high forward angle light scatter and 90 degrees C light zzso This gate excluded much of the normal cell contamination within the tumor zzso The data show that the heat response of human tumor zzso varied significantly, with cervical zzso and zzso melanoma being the most resistant and the zzso and zzso zzso the most heat zzso Finally, evidence is presented for the expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso appears to be useful in measuring the intrinsic cellular heat sensitivity of human tumors and in determining the zzso of zzso of zzso following an initial heat zzso
