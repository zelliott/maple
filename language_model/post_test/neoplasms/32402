The involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso system in particular has been extensively studied in the zzso of zzso The molecular role of the zzso zzso zzso is well characterized with its participation in cell migration and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cancer has been demonstrated in many studies and is considered an attractive target for zzso zzso We and others have zzso zzso expression in an attempt to inhibit cancer zzso based on its molecular zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso anchored protein is not only bound to the cell surface but also has a soluble form, zzso There is now accumulated clinical and experimental evidence supporting the significant role of zzso and its soluble counterpart in a number of solid zzso The expression of zzso can be associated with tumor cells or zzso cells or zzso zzso observed in the expression of zzso using zzso zzso are likely explained by the use of different zzso and techniques rather than true cellular differences and are reviewed zzso This review summarizes the clinical relevance of zzso and its soluble form in the prognosis and diagnosis of different zzso
