Olive oil is an integral ingredient of the zzso zzso and accumulating evidence suggests that it may have a potential role in lowering the risk of several types of zzso The mechanisms by which the zzso effects of olive oil can be performed, however, are not zzso We recently hypothesized that a novel molecular explanation concerning the zzso actions of olive oil may relate to the ability of its zzso fatty acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso to specifically regulate zzso zzso Supporting our hypothesis, zzso supplementation of cultured breast cancer cells with zzso zzso of zzso was found to suppress the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso playing a key role in the zzso progression and response to chemotherapy and zzso therapy in approximately zzso of breast zzso zzso treatment was also found to zzso enhance the efficacy of zzso a humanized zzso zzso binding with high affinity to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso exposure significantly diminished the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso and, consequently, its zzso status, a crucial molecular event that determines both the aggressive behavior and the response to zzso of zzso breast zzso Our most recent findings further reveal that zzso exposure may suppresses zzso at the zzso level by zzso the expression of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein that specifically blocks zzso promoter zzso in breast, zzso and stomach cancer cell zzso This zzso property of zzso offers a previously zzso molecular mechanism by which olive oil may regulate the zzso behavior of cancer zzso From a clinical perspective, it could provide an effective means of influencing the outcome of zzso human zzso with poor zzso Indeed, zzso zzso repression of zzso zzso may represent a novel zzso explanation linking zzso zzso olive oil and cancer as it seems to equally operate in various types of zzso zzso
