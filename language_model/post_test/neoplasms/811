Treatment delivery with active beam scanning in zzso radiation therapy introduces the problem of interplay effects when pencil beam motion occurs on a similar time scale as zzso tumor zzso In situations where zzso may not provide enough repetition to blur the effects of zzso repeated delivery or zzso of each field several times within a fraction has been zzso The purpose of this work was to investigate the effectiveness of different repainting strategies in zzso beam zzso To assess the zzso impact of interplay effects, we performed a series of simulations considering the following zzso tumor motion zzso breathing period, asymmetry in the motion trajectory for the target and time required to change the beam energy for the delivery zzso Several repainting strategies were compared in terms of potential vulnerability to a dose delivery zzso zzso motion perpendicular to the beam direction (representing zzso type tumor motion in zzso was considered and modeled as an zzso sine function with a zzso zzso of between 10 and 30 zzso The results show that motion effects cause a narrowing of the high-dose profile and widening of the zzso The zzso zzso area was reduced significantly when considering a large motion zzso of 3 zzso The broadening of the zzso appears to depend only on the zzso of tumor motion zzso harmonic zzso The delivered dose exhibits a shift of zzso of the tumor zzso (or zzso zzso in the zzso direction due to breathing asymmetry observed for both zzso and zzso zzso Of the five repainting techniques zzso so-called zzso zzso turned out to be most effective in reducing dose errors with a minimal increase in treatment zzso In this method, each energy level is zzso at several evenly spaced times within one breathing zzso To keep dose delivery errors below zzso while minimizing treatment time, it is recommended that breath sampling repainting be employed using zzso paintings per field for an assumed tumor volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso For smaller tumor volumes more zzso will be required, while for larger volumes five zzso should be sufficient to achieve the required dose zzso
