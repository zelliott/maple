The Finnish cohort was comprised of zzso men and women from six road paving zzso The mortality of men employed during at least one season zzso was followed up from 1964 until end of 1994; an average of 17 zzso zzso mortality ratios zzso and relative risks zzso the latter based on zzso zzso zzso models were estimated by occupational group and by various metrics of occupational zzso 

zzso mortality was elevated zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso mainly due to excesses in zzso poisonings, and violence zzso zzso zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso Workers exposed to zzso fumes had a slightly elevated mortality from lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models with 15-year lag period suggested trends by cumulative exposure to coal zzso organic zzso zzso dust, diesel zzso and zzso zzso 

The elevated mortality from external causes among Finnish zzso construction workers was probably due to living conditions and related zzso Some evidence was found for a risk of lung cancer due to occupational exposure, but the confirmation of these findings would require a longer follow-up and improved control for zzso
