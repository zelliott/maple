Survival and cure rates for childhood zzso in Europe have greatly improved over the past 40 years and are mostly good, although not in all European zzso The zzso survival study estimates survival of children diagnosed with cancer between 2000 and 2007, zzso whether survival differences among European countries have changed, and investigates changes from 1999 to zzso 

We zzso survival data for zzso children (age zzso zzso diagnosed between Jan 1, 1978 and Dec 31, zzso They came from 74 zzso cancer zzso in 29 zzso We calculated observed, zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival for major zzso and all zzso zzso For comparison between countries, we used the corrected group prognosis method to provide survival probabilities adjusted for multiple zzso zzso age, period of diagnosis, and, for all zzso combined without zzso zzso zzso zzso survival differences by area and calendar period were calculated with period analysis and were given for all zzso combined and the major zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso For all zzso combined for children diagnosed in zzso zzso survival was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso survival was zzso % zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival was zzso zzso zzso zzso For all zzso combined, zzso survival rose from zzso zzso for zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The greatest improvements were in eastern Europe, where zzso survival rose from zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso average yearly change in mortality zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for acute zzso zzso zzso zzso for acute zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for all of Europe did not change significantly for Hodgkin's lymphoma, zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ewing's zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso survival persisted between countries and regions, ranging from zzso to zzso (for zzso 

Several reasons might explain zzso zzso The lack of health-care resources is probably most important, especially in some eastern European countries with limited drug supply, lack of zzso zzso with multidisciplinary teams, delayed diagnosis and treatment, poor management of treatment, and drug zzso In the short term, cross-border care and collaborative zzso could help to narrow the survival gaps in zzso
