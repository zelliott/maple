To analyze the clinical results of 2 200 zzso zzso 

The following factors were zzso zzso the graft survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years; zzso main factors contributing to the zzso zzso factors affecting the survival rate of zzso zzso zzso features of zzso after zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso on liver function after zzso zzso zzso treatments for chronic zzso and zzso effect of zzso typing on zzso zzso 

From 1972 to 2000, 2 200 zzso zzso were performed in 1 zzso patients (1 337 men and zzso zzso with zzso zzso failure in our hospital, zzso The graft survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, after using zzso since zzso zzso recipients were aged over 50 years whose one year graft survival rate was zzso and one year patient survival rate was zzso zzso was the dominant death factor after zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso and a death rate of zzso The zzso of positive zzso after zzso transplantation was up to zzso in with a death rate of zzso The zzso of tumor after zzso transplantation was zzso The most frequent site of tumor was zzso zzso The patient's liver function before transplantation and the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso were the major toxic factors of the zzso The zzso of acute rejection were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, when the zzso zzso were 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and zzso 

Using zzso zzso preventing acute zzso and achieving good zzso typing are the major factors improving long-term zzso survival zzso
