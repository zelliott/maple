The purpose of this report is to describe the results of stem cell transplantation as initial treatment for secondary acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso patients zzso age 42 zzso with secondary zzso (17 zzso 29 zzso who had not received zzso induction chemotherapy underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso The zzso zzso zzso survival was zzso and the cumulative zzso of zzso and zzso mortality were zzso and zzso zzso Lower peripheral blood blast count was associated with a lower risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso and shorter time from zzso diagnosis to transplant was associated with a lower risk of zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso and improved zzso survival zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso secondary zzso tended to have lower zzso survival zzso zzso zzso and a higher zzso rate zzso zzso zzso than patients whose leukemia was not zzso The results of these 46 previously zzso patients were compared to 20 patients zzso age 36 years, 12 zzso 8 zzso transplanted with zzso disease after induction chemotherapy zzso complete zzso zzso zzso zzso second complete zzso zzso zzso zzso first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found no statistically significant difference in outcome between these 2 groups of zzso These results suggest that prompt transplantation should be considered after diagnosis of secondary zzso or, if possible, high-risk zzso particularly in patients with low peripheral blast zzso Innovative transplant strategies are needed to reduce the high risks of zzso and zzso mortality seen in this patient zzso
