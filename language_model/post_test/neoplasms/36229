The zzso copper zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating copper zzso because copper is an essential zzso and copper zzso is zzso to many important cellular functions, but excess copper is zzso Recent research has revealed that human copper zzso is tightly controlled by zzso zzso involving copper, zzso and human zzso This zzso uses zzso zzso factor as a copper sensor in modulating zzso zzso which in turn controls cellular copper and zzso levels in a zzso mutual regulatory zzso zzso regulation of zzso expression by copper stresses has also been described in the zzso Because zzso can also transport platinum drugs, this finding underscores the important role of zzso in zzso sensitivity in cancer zzso zzso with this notion is the finding that elevated zzso expression was associated with favorable treatment outcomes in zzso cancer zzso Moreover, cultured cell studies showed that elevated zzso expression can be induced by depleting cellular copper levels, resulting in enhanced zzso zzso and its zzso zzso A phase I clinical trial using a combination of zzso (a copper zzso and zzso has been carried out with encouraging zzso This review discusses new insights into the role of zzso in regulating copper zzso and explains how modulating cellular copper availability could influence treatment efficacy in zzso cancer chemotherapy through zzso zzso
