The zzso vaccine has been used to prevent tuberculosis since zzso and applied for zzso in zzso since the zzso Both the preventive and zzso effects have been evaluated and communicated with contradictory, positive and negative zzso For an objective evaluation and interpretation of the protective zzso effectiveness and efficiency of the zzso vaccination it must be considered that: zzso several zzso zzso have been developed in manufacturing laboratories that differ in the residual zzso which determines zzso and zzso zzso various liquid and zzso zzso vaccine production methods are used, resulting in different zzso viable units per zzso zzso quantitative zzso methods are not yet being used for statistical quality control of the zzso zzso zzso products are applied in various zzso zzso and socioeconomic conditions with different vaccination zzso zzso inadequate zzso models are often used to zzso zzso effectiveness and adverse zzso The same conditions influence the precise evaluation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso DNA technology will modify production methods, and explain at the molecular level the mechanism of the protective effects zzso zzso in tuberculosis and zzso in zzso High level laboratory techniques and zzso methods, based on probability logic and zzso zzso ensure appropriate experimental designs and the exact analysis of laboratory data and the results of vaccination zzso They will lead to the evaluation of the protective effect of zzso in order to reduce the zzso zzso
