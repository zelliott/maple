Both the World Health Organization and the UK Expert Panel on Air Quality zzso zzso have considered zzso zzso as a marker of the zzso potency of the zzso aromatic zzso zzso mixture, when recommending their respective guidelines for zzso in outdoor zzso The aim of this research is to compare the zzso and relative abundance of individual zzso and their contribution to the overall zzso potential of the zzso mixture in indoor and outdoor environments to assess the suitability of the UK air quality standard derived for outdoor air for use as a zzso for indoor zzso zzso were collected onto filters using active sampling in different indoor and outdoor zzso The ratio of individual compounds to zzso the zzso equivalent zzso and the percentage contribution of each individual compound to the total zzso potential of the zzso mixture were zzso Mean zzso were generally lower indoors zzso zzso than outdoors zzso zzso with the exception of indoor environments with wood zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The ratio of individual zzso to zzso showed no significant differences between indoors zzso zzso and outdoors zzso The relative contribution of zzso to the zzso overall zzso potency is similar indoors zzso outdoors zzso and in the zzso environment zzso used by zzso to derive the UK Air Quality Standard for ambient zzso These results suggest the suitability of zzso as a marker for the zzso potential of the zzso mixture irrespective of the zzso Despite small differences in zzso mixture composition indoors and outdoors, the level of protection afforded by the present zzso standard is likely to be similar whether it is applied to indoor or outdoor zzso
