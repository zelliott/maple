Ras proteins are key regulators of zzso zzso controlling many processes such as zzso differentiation and zzso zzso in these proteins or in their zzso zzso and regulators are associated with pathological conditions, particularly the development of various forms of human zzso zzso proteins signal through direct interaction with a number of zzso zzso one of the best characterized being type I zzso zzso zzso Although the ability of zzso to control zzso zzso has long been well established in cultured cells, evidence for a role of the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso in normal and zzso cell growth in zzso has only been obtained zzso Mice with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that block its ability to interact with zzso are highly resistant to zzso zzso zzso induced lung zzso and zzso zzso induced skin zzso zzso from these mice show zzso defects and selective disruption of zzso from certain growth factors to zzso zzso while the mice also display delayed development of the zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso is thus required in zzso for some normal growth factor zzso and also for zzso zzso zzso zzso family members were among the first zzso identified over 40 years zzso In the late 1960s, the zzso Harvey and Kirsten zzso zzso zzso were discovered and subsequently shown to promote cancer formation through related zzso termed zzso (from rat zzso zzso The central role of zzso proteins in human cancer is highlighted by the large number of zzso in which they are activated by zzso approximately zzso of human zzso carry a zzso in zzso zzso Because of the complex zzso network in which zzso operates, with multiple zzso and zzso each with a different pattern of zzso expression and a distinct set of zzso functions, one of the critical issues concerns the specific role of each zzso in zzso zzso In this chapter, we zzso current knowledge about how zzso regulates one of its best-known zzso zzso zzso zzso
