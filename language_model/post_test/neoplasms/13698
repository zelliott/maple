This paper presents the results of zzso of zzso Markus and zzso zzso chambers following the procedures outlined in the zzso zzso International Atomic Energy Agency code of zzso According to this zzso zzso zzso of plane parallel chambers follows 2 zzso The first method uses a zzso electron beam and consists of comparing the plane parallel chamber with a zzso chamber whose zzso zzso factor, traceable to zzso zzso is known, while the second method applies to a zzso gamma beam whose air zzso rate is known at the zzso zzso As the second method is generally applied in Secondary Standard zzso Laboratories, the consistency of zzso free zzso and in a water phantom has been zzso A close agreement is shown between the 2 methods (the zzso factors differ by at most zzso These results lead to the conclusion that either of the 2 zzso methods can be used, provided that the correction factors given by the zzso zzso code of practice are zzso
