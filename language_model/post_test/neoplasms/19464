Recent reports from US and Japan have established that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso occur in a subset of patients with lung cancer that respond to therapy with zzso a zzso zzso To gain further insights into the role of zzso in zzso of lung and tumors of diverse zzso that are currently under investigation with drugs of the same class, we have taken in examination a panel of tumors consisting in 110 pulmonary zzso 40 pulmonary zzso zzso 40 gastric zzso and 40 zzso zzso The sequence analysis of zzso 19 and 21 of the zzso has allowed the identification of 10 cases exhibiting specific deletions in zzso 19 and 1 case with point zzso in a zzso zzso in zzso zzso All zzso zzso occur specifically in lung zzso while tumors of different zzso result zzso The rate of zzso affecting these other tumors is either very rare, involves different zzso of the zzso or other zzso zzso The molecular analysis of the zzso gene can help identify patients that will benefit from zzso zzso
