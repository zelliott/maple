A better understanding on the development of a zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso is essential to help identify patients at high risk for zzso zzso we have studied the role of the zzso family of zzso zzso in the process of zzso zzso by examining the expression of zzso and zzso in primary zzso and their zzso zzso in 46 patients using zzso The expression of both zzso and zzso was significantly higher zzso in primary zzso as compared to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso increased with the degree of the zzso grade zzso and zzso of the primary zzso zzso zzso survival zzso was shorter in patients who had zzso with a zzso expression of zzso as compared to those with zzso expression zzso months vs zzso months zzso zzso Our finding that zzso expression in zzso zzso may reflect the aggressiveness of the primary zzso from which it has originated implicates an important link between the two zzso zzso expression may also provide valuable biological information as suggested by the observation that zzso zzso expression in zzso is associated with a shorter zzso
