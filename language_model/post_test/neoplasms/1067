zzso disparities in cancer outcomes have been observed in several zzso However, it is unclear if survival differences persist after adjusting for clinical, zzso and treatment zzso Our objective was to determine whether racial disparities in survival exist among patients enrolled in consecutive trials conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group zzso 

We identified 19 zzso adult cancer patients zzso with breast, zzso with zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with prostate zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with multiple zzso who were treated on 35 zzso zzso phase III clinical trials from October 1, 1974, through November 29, zzso Patients were grouped according to studies of diseases with similar zzso and zzso Cox zzso was used to evaluate the association between race and overall survival within each disease site zzso controlling for available zzso factors plus education and income, which are surrogates for socioeconomic zzso Median and zzso overall survival estimates were derived by the zzso zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

Of 19 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso were African zzso After adjustment for zzso factors, African American race was associated with increased mortality in patients with zzso zzso breast cancer zzso ratio zzso for death zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso for death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso for death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso for death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso No statistically significant association between race and survival for lung cancer, colon cancer, lymphoma, zzso or myeloma was zzso Additional adjustments for socioeconomic status did not substantially change these zzso zzso (and zzso overall survival rates for African American vs all other patients were zzso (not zzso vs zzso (not zzso respectively, for zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso for advanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso for advanced prostate zzso 

African American patients with zzso zzso had worse survival than white patients, despite enrollment on phase III zzso trials with uniform stage, treatment, and zzso
