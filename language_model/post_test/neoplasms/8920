With the increasing use of novel targeted agents and the development of high imaging techniques, response evaluation criteria in solid zzso zzso zzso developed primarily for zzso agents and zzso imaging, has demonstrated zzso A survey was conducted of zzso users to identify concerns and their suggestions for future zzso zzso 

140 key partners of the zzso collaboration were asked to complete a zzso The 49 questions concerned zzso satisfaction and concerns with zzso zzso zzso use of modified zzso criteria and zzso suggestions for the next zzso zzso 

zzso replies were zzso zzso zzso were satisfied with zzso zzso while zzso indicated zzso Areas of potential weakness zzso zzso lack of incorporation of potential early indicators of response such as functional imaging, zzso lack of validation in rarer zzso types and zzso lack of validation for novel zzso zzso Suggestions were zzso with highest numbers on two zzso developing zzso for certain disease types and including advanced imaging techniques for the zzso 

zzso suggestions were received for zzso the next zzso zzso data collection will make it possible to investigate the possible zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging in zzso assessment, to verify whether zzso zzso still be zzso in novel targeted therapy and to consider the need for criteria for specific disease zzso
