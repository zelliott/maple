World Health Organization zzso guidelines, Agency for Health Care Policy and Research zzso clinical practice guidelines, and zzso recommendations indicate oral route of zzso administration as the preferred zzso zzso administration of zzso is considered an alternative when patients cannot take medications zzso Moreover, WHO and zzso indicate orally administered zzso as the zzso drug for the treatment of moderate to severe zzso zzso However, we can see that in Italy there is an increasing use of zzso zzso zzso as zzso strong zzso (and zzso even when oral administration of zzso is zzso 

The aims of this study are to describe the zzso in the use of zzso administration in two settings of care, taking into consideration zzso the drugs previously taken by the patients, zzso the reasons for switching from any drug to zzso zzso the conversion ratio used, and zzso the frequency of zzso use of zzso zzso according to the WHO guidelines and the zzso zzso zzso switching to zzso patch from any drug, even if there were no zzso in using oral zzso The settings of care considered were the zzso zzso care unit zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the National Cancer Institute zzso of zzso 

The clinical charts of 98 patients prescribed with and given zzso patch for the first time at the zzso of Milan in 2002 were reviewed and the data gathered were grouped according to the administration of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso or at the zzso (35 zzso zzso descriptive statistics and bar and box plots have been zzso Fisher zzso exact text was applied to test the differences between zzso and zzso 

Before switching to zzso zzso zzso were more frequently treated with zzso zzso drugs zzso and weak zzso zzso zzso in respect to the zzso zzso vs zzso who were mostly treated with oral zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso were treated with oral zzso and only zzso with zzso zzso in respect to zzso where zzso were on oral zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso In zzso of zzso and in zzso of zzso changing to zzso patch was considered as zzso zzso according to the WHO guidelines and the zzso zzso No statistically significant differences between the two settings were observed regarding the reasons for switching and the conversion ratio zzso 

There is a trend to use zzso patch as zzso strong zzso in cancer patients in situations such as zzso phase, in the presence of zzso pain, and in the absence of zzso or gastrointestinal symptoms where the use of oral zzso is, however, not zzso
