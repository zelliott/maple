Cancer cells and zzso cells differ in their metabolism and they emit distinct volatile compound profiles, allowing to zzso cancer cells by their zzso zzso zzso receptors are excellent zzso with high sensitivity and a broad receptive range zzso by current gas zzso We thus investigated the potential of zzso the fruit zzso zzso system to detect cancer zzso Using in zzso calcium imaging, we recorded an array of zzso zzso zzso on the fruit zzso zzso We performed zzso analysis of antenna responses, finding that cell zzso from different cell types lead to characteristic response zzso The distances between these response zzso are zzso across flies and can be used to discriminate healthy zzso zzso cells from different types of breast cancer zzso This may expand the repertoire of clinical zzso and it is the first step towards electronic noses equipped with biological sensors, zzso artificial and biological zzso
