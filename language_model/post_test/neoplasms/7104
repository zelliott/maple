To establish the zzso dose and evaluate zzso zzso zzso effects, and zzso activity of zzso a second-generation zzso to zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso in patients with advanced zzso zzso zzso 

This was a zzso zzso phase I zzso zzso zzso was administered by continuous intravenous infusion over 7 days zzso or 3 days zzso of a zzso treatment zzso zzso escalation started at 48 zzso and continued until consistent zzso toxicity zzso was zzso 

zzso patients were entered in seven zzso Grade 3 to 4 adverse events were uncommon and were predominantly abnormal laboratory zzso elevated zzso zzso and zzso zzso comprised elevated zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso doses were defined as 125 zzso for the zzso regimen and zzso or zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso area under the plasma concentration curve and peak plasma concentration increased zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels was zzso at 72 hours zzso suppression, zzso and this coincided with a dramatic decrease in circulating tumor cells in a patient with zzso zzso Two further patients had zzso partial zzso zzso zzso of cell death and zzso altered in association with drug infusion and zzso 

In this zzso study, zzso was well zzso with predictable zzso zzso properties, and clinical evidence of zzso activity in patients with zzso lymphoma, melanoma, and breast zzso Phase zzso trials of zzso chemotherapy combinations are ongoing in patients with zzso breast, zzso lung cancer, acute zzso zzso lymphoma, and solid tumors for which zzso is zzso
