In view of the clear evidence that zzso type zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the processes of tumor cell zzso zzso aneurysm, and multiple zzso it has become a target of choice for pharmacological zzso The goal of this study was thus to determine the presence of zzso of zzso in plants known traditionally for their zzso zzso Crude methanol extracts were prepared from the leaves of plants zzso collected from the zzso dry forest zzso Puerto zzso and tested for the presence of zzso of zzso using the zzso plate zzso The extracts that tested positive zzso were then zzso with petroleum zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a sequential zzso The resulting zzso were then tested again using the zzso plate zzso zzso from leaves of Croton zzso zzso zzso showed the presence of a strong zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso partitions were performed to determine the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso extract showed the lowest zzso value zzso zzso and hence contained the most potent zzso zzso Further investigations revealed that the crude methanol extract and its zzso and zzso partitions did not significantly inhibit closely related zzso such as the tissue type zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating their selectivity for zzso and hence superior potential for medicinal use with fewer side zzso In a further evaluation of their therapeutic potential for prevention of cancer zzso the zzso zzso extracts displayed zzso activity against human pancreatic zzso zzso cells, as determined through an zzso zzso The zzso activities recorded for each of the partitions correlated with their relative zzso zzso zzso There are no existing reports of zzso zzso being present in any of the plants reported in this zzso
