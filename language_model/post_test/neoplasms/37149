zzso recognition of human zzso except melanoma is not well understood at either the cellular or the molecular zzso We demonstrate in this study the existence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of all 4 gastric cancer patients zzso We established zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 2 zzso zzso patients, and zzso zzso zzso recognizing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the 2 remaining zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were established in 1 of the 2 zzso zzso patients who had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso clones were established from these parental zzso zzso The 2 zzso zzso zzso lines zzso 8 of 13 zzso zzso zzso cell lines established from different zzso zzso zzso lung and zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso line recognized 9 and 6 different zzso zzso of peptides zzso from the zzso zzso breast and zzso zzso colon zzso cell lines, zzso zzso deletion of zzso zzso or zzso molecules was observed in some tumor lines that were not susceptible to zzso by the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of gastric cancer possess zzso recognizing different zzso zzso binding to different zzso zzso that are widely expressed on zzso and also, to some extent, on SCC from different zzso
