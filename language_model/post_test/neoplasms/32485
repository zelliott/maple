In addition to a variety of other novel agents, interest in zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso drugs has recently accelerated and increasing numbers of these compounds have entered clinical trials in zzso zzso represent a zzso of zzso targeted agents that zzso signal zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso Newer generation zzso have been introduced into the clinical arena that are considerably more potent on a zzso basis than their predecessors and are beginning to show early evidence of activity, particularly in zzso zzso In addition, there is an increasing appreciation of the fact that zzso may act through mechanisms other than induction of zzso zzso and, as in the case of other zzso agents, it is conceivable that the ultimate role of zzso in cancer therapy will be as zzso of zzso induced by other zzso zzso One particularly promising strategy involves attempts to combine zzso with other novel agents to promote zzso cell differentiation or zzso The present review focuses on recent insights into the mechanisms by which zzso exert their zzso effects, either alone or in combination with other compounds, as well as attempts to translate these findings into the zzso
