The inhibitor of zzso protein zzso family can inhibit zzso induced by a variety of zzso We and others previously described the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso is unique among the zzso members as, on a strong zzso zzso it is specifically zzso by zzso to produce a truncated protein with paradoxical zzso activity zzso We also showed that zzso encodes two zzso zzso termed zzso alpha and zzso with diverse zzso effects in zzso In this study, we compared the zzso zzso in zzso An animal model was established and the effects of zzso alpha and beta on the initiation and development of tumors were zzso In the animal model, zzso alpha promotes tumor initiation in comparison with zzso Interestingly, the growth of tumors originating from cells expressing zzso beta was zzso In these tumors, zzso beta was zzso and produced a high level of the zzso zzso beta that zzso tumor zzso When we eliminated the zzso effect of zzso beta by point zzso the resulting zzso zzso beta zzso contributed to tumor zzso In terms of zzso we show that zzso beta tumors develop only in mice lacking natural killer zzso cell zzso Thus, from the animal model, we can conclude that zzso plays a major role in zzso and that zzso cells induce zzso of zzso to its zzso truncated protein that in turn zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso may serve as potential targets for cancer zzso
