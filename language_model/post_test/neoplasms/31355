To evaluate and compare the risk of long-term central zzso zzso zzso infection in human zzso virus zzso and cancer zzso 

Prospective zzso cohort study based on active surveillance of long-term zzso zzso and patient outcome over a zzso zzso 

Services of infectious diseases and zzso of 12 university hospitals in Paris, zzso 

In 1995, all zzso and cancer patients with solid zzso were included at the time of long-term zzso zzso 

Overall, zzso of long-term zzso infections were identified in zzso of 201 zzso and zzso of 255 cancer zzso Most were associated with zzso most commonly zzso zzso The long-term zzso zzso infection risk was greater in zzso than in cancer patients zzso vs zzso infections per 1,000 long-term zzso zzso zzso The independent risk factors of long-term zzso infection were as zzso in zzso patients, frequency of long-term zzso handling and zzso in cancer patients, poor zzso performance zzso in both zzso and cancer patients, recent history of bacterial zzso The risk of long-term zzso infection was similar for zzso zzso and zzso access ports in each zzso 

Prevention of long-term zzso infection should focus first on better sterile precautions while handling long-term zzso especially in zzso patients who have frequent and daily use of the long-term zzso
