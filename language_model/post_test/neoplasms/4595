As several possible zzso and therapeutic applications of zzso are currently under trial, the available methods for its zzso in biological zzso should be zzso In this report, the zzso zzso zzso is compared to an zzso zzso for the determination of zzso in serum and plasma of normal subjects and patients with cancer, zzso and systemic lupus zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso and culture zzso The results show a good correlation between the two methods in all zzso Mean values of the examined groups were statistically different between the zzso only in the case of septic zzso This may be attributed either to the influence of other molecules on the zzso or to the zzso of the zzso zzso Since zzso are easier to perform, it seems that they are more suitable for routine use, the zzso being preferable in cases where increased sensitivity is zzso
