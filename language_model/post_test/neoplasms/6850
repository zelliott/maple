Deciphering the complex network structure is crucial in drug target zzso This study presents a framework incorporating graph zzso and network decomposition methods to analyze zzso properties of the comprehensive map of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso which is a good candidate model system to study the general mechanisms of signal zzso The graph zzso analysis of the zzso network indicates that it has zzso characteristics with zzso zzso The employment of network decomposition analysis enlightened the zzso properties, such as network zzso specific molecules in each zzso and participation of molecules in the zzso Participating in a significant fraction of the fundamental paths connecting the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and complex zzso were identified as zzso zzso through which all pathways of zzso network are zzso zzso complex is identified as important due to its role in all fundamental paths through zzso and being specific to this zzso zzso of this complex may be good zzso agents having very little or no effect on other zzso
