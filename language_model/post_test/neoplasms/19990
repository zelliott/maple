zzso fluid is a solution that zzso and surrounds the human cells and provides them with nutrients and a way of waste zzso It is generally believed that elevated tumor zzso fluid pressure zzso is partly responsible for the poor penetration and distribution of therapeutic agents in solid tumors, but the complex interplay of zzso zzso vascular zzso and zzso and zzso drug transport remains poorly zzso Here we zzso the help of a theoretical zzso tumor zzso zzso fluid flow zzso and its impact upon drug delivery within tumor depending on zzso zzso such as vessel network zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We developed a vascular tumor growth model, including vessel zzso regression, and zzso that we extend here by the zzso zzso by a porous medium obeying zzso zzso and sources zzso and sinks zzso for zzso With it we zzso the spatial variation of the zzso and zzso and determine its correlation with the vascular network zzso and zzso parameters like vessel wall zzso tissue zzso distribution of zzso zzso We find that an increased vascular wall zzso together with a reduction of zzso function leads to increased tumor zzso but also that the latter does not necessarily imply a decreased zzso rate: Generally the IF flow rate is positively correlated with the various zzso in the zzso The zzso field is then used to determine the drug distribution after an injection via a zzso diffusion reaction equation for zzso and zzso zzso with parameters guided by experimental data for the drug zzso We observe that the interplay of zzso and zzso drug transport can lead to quite unexpected effects in the presence of a heterogeneous, zzso zzso Finally we discuss various strategies to increase drug exposure time of tumor zzso
