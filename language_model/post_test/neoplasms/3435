zzso studies indicate that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the induction of zzso by zzso provided zzso is followed by zzso We therefore designed a phase I clinical trial of sequential zzso and zzso 

zzso was administered at a fixed dose, as either a zzso or zzso infusion on day 1, followed by a 24-hour infusion of zzso on day zzso zzso of zzso were escalated in successive zzso according to a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained on all zzso 

zzso zzso developed with 24-hour zzso doses of 135 and 100 zzso and zzso doses of 10 and 20 zzso zzso With zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso could be escalated to 70 zzso without zzso zzso With zzso zzso next escalated to 135 zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary toxicity occurred when zzso was escalated to 94 zzso This did not correlate with any change in zzso or zzso zzso At a zzso zzso dose of 175 zzso zzso pulmonary toxicity occurred in only one patient at zzso doses under 94 zzso Clinical activity was observed in patients with zzso zzso and prostate cancer, including patients who had progressed on zzso 

The recommended phase II doses will be a zzso infusion of zzso at 175 zzso on day 1 followed by a 24-hour infusion of zzso at 70 zzso on day zzso zzso dose zzso to 80 zzso are zzso At these doses, zzso are manageable and clinical activity is zzso
