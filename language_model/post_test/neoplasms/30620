The limited restriction of zzso zzso would facilitate our understanding of the zzso zzso of genetic diseases and zzso We have described methods for zzso zzso zzso embedded in zzso zzso We now describe how zzso I zzso can be zzso in a zzso restriction zzso with zzso I to restrict zzso zzso into a limited number of zzso We have restricted the zzso of zzso zzso at four sites and zzso the three zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso Unlike the recently published zzso using DNA sequences inserted into zzso and zzso zzso the zzso described here use zzso zzso zzso for highly limited zzso This methodology has applications in zzso zzso and reducing the cost of sequencing the human zzso
