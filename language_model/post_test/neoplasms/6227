To determine the safety and zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso establish the maximum tolerated dose zzso and evaluate the zzso and zzso profile of the zzso 

We conducted a phase I study of zzso with zzso and zzso in patients with advanced solid zzso Treatment at dose level 1 zzso consisted of zzso 100 zzso orally every 12 hours on days 1 to 4, zzso 500 zzso on days 3 and 10, and zzso 60 zzso on day zzso zzso levels were measured in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in two of three patients at zzso included zzso and zzso zzso The protocol was amended to enroll patients treated with zzso 2 prior severely zzso chemotherapy regimens and treated with zzso 100 zzso once daily on days 1 to 4 zzso No zzso were seen in six patients at zzso Because of persistent zzso and zzso following a return to zzso patients received 100 zzso zzso every 12 hours on day 1 zzso No zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso included gastrointestinal zzso zzso and zzso Of 21 patients zzso for response, two had partial zzso zzso inhibited zzso in zzso and tumor zzso although zzso levels were less effectively inhibited when zzso was used for a short zzso 

zzso in combination with zzso and zzso is associated with zzso even at relatively low zzso zzso schedules of zzso in chemotherapy zzso patients will have to be explored with standard doses of zzso
