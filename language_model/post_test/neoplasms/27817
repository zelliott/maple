Whether cancer zzso can be reduced to the molecular zzso of cancer cells is a question that must be addressed in three zzso focusing on its zzso zzso and zzso zzso The possibility of zzso reduction hinges on whether zzso have other important constituents than zzso Although this must obviously be answered in the negative, it should be emphasized that both zzso and zzso DNA investigations provide us with very selective pictures of zzso zzso This is of concern because the higher order packing of DNA and its joining with other molecules to form zzso structures give rise to emergent properties, functional features that become manifest only at higher levels of complexity and that may not be zzso from the base pair composition of the zzso A position of extreme zzso zzso would in our context be that the best research strategy is always to investigate the genetic changes of tumor cells at the highest possible resolution level, as zzso of genes and, ultimately, as changes in DNA primary zzso There are two fundamental differences between zzso and molecular genetic techniques that make this stance zzso First, whereas zzso investigations are zzso (all zzso aberrations are zzso molecular genetic analyses are highly specific zzso those aberrations are revealed that one tests zzso Second, whereas the molecular approach determines the zzso constitution of an idealized, average tumor cell, zzso analysis is of real, individual zzso These may not necessarily be representative of the main population of the zzso but at least whatever zzso differences exist between them are zzso zzso and zzso evolution within the tumor can thereby be zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
