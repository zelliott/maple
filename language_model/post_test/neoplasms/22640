All zzso diagnosed with cancer in Sweden during a two-and-a-half year period were invited to participate in the zzso Analysis was performed on combined data from two zzso two and-a-half and five months after start of cancer treatment zzso zzso zzso The instrument was examined with respect to zzso data quality, reliability and construct and zzso zzso 

Missing items per dimension ranged from 0 to zzso percent, with a majority below three zzso zzso alpha values exceeded zzso for all zzso There was support for the suggested groupings of items into dimensions for all but six of the 36 items of the zzso included in this zzso The instrument zzso zzso between diagnoses reflecting treatment zzso 

The results indicate satisfactory data quality and reliability of the zzso when used in children undergoing treatment for zzso zzso of construct zzso showed generally acceptable results, although not entirely supporting the suggested zzso zzso zzso evaluation in a larger sample of children during and after treatment for cancer is zzso
