We used data from the first large-scale overwhelmingly zzso study zzso to zzso the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in survivors of childhood cancer in relation to cancer type and treatment and zzso to assess live birth rates relative to the general zzso 

A zzso including questions zzso about pregnancy zzso was completed by zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso were zzso zzso ratios zzso for live birth, zzso zzso zzso premature birth, and low birth weight were calculated for different types of childhood cancer and by whether initial treatment involved chemotherapy and abdominal or brain zzso For zzso the observed number of live zzso was compared with that expected based on the general population of England and zzso 

Female survivors exposed to abdominal zzso had a significantly increased OR of delivering zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and producing offspring with a low birth weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An increased OR of miscarriage was also associated with abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of live zzso observed from all female survivors was two thirds of that expected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lowest among survivors treated with brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Female survivors of childhood cancer treated with abdominal zzso are at zzso increased risk of delivering zzso zzso increased risk of low birth weight, and a small increased risk of zzso Overall, female survivors produce considerably fewer offspring than expected, particularly those treated with abdominal or brain zzso
