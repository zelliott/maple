Bone zzso zzso cells zzso possess a population of vascular zzso cells that enable them to acquire a zzso and zzso coherent with zzso cells zzso Recent evidence indicates that a hypoxic environment such as that encountered in tumor masses regulates zzso zzso properties by pathways that remain to be zzso It is also unclear as to what extent these zzso precursor cells could contribute to the growth of zzso vessels at the vicinity of tumor zzso In this study, we found that zzso exhibited the ability to generate three-dimensional zzso networks on zzso and that this property was zzso by growth zzso zzso media isolated from several zzso cell zzso In particular, basic zzso growth factor, a key zzso of zzso was found to be the most potent growth factor for inducing zzso zzso migration, and zzso The setup of a new two-dimensional in zzso zzso zzso further showed that zzso were zzso recruited when cultured in the presence of either zzso or differentiated zzso zzso In zzso subcutaneous zzso of zzso with zzso zzso cells in nude mice resulted in the formation of highly zzso tumors, where zzso differentiated into zzso cells and localized at the zzso of vascular zzso Our data suggest that zzso could be recruited at the sites of active tumor zzso through zzso regulation of their zzso zzso These observations may have crucial implications in the development of novel therapies using zzso engineered to zzso zzso agents and to antagonize tumor zzso
