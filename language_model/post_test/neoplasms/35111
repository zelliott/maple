zzso directed against zzso proteins have been identified in some patients with zzso zzso zzso To identify the molecular targets for these zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso expression library from human zzso and screened the library with zzso from a patient with zzso zzso zzso A single zzso zzso produced a fusion protein that reacted strongly with the patient's zzso The isolated zzso clone was used to identify six overlapping zzso zzso zzso of the zzso clones revealed a distinctive pattern consisting of a unit of 18 zzso (6 zzso zzso repeated in tandem along the entire zzso zzso This sequence is unlike any previously described zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis was consistent with zzso representation of the zzso zzso zzso gene in the human and mouse zzso zzso zzso studies with normal zzso showed expression of the zzso gene to be largely restricted to zzso zzso of the zzso message was also noted in cell lines derived from zzso of zzso zzso and lung zzso
