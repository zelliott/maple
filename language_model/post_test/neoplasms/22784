At present, it is known that zzso zzso would mainly depend on an zzso action zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso the so-called regulatory T zzso zzso which are identified as zzso zzso Moreover, it has been shown that zzso immunity is under zzso regulation, mainly zzso by the zzso hormone zzso zzso This study was performed to investigate the in zzso and in zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso 

We evaluated the in zzso effects of zzso (20 zzso orally in the evening) in 20 patients with zzso zzso solid tumor and the in zzso effects of zzso incubation (at 10 and 100 zzso of pure zzso cultures on zzso cell zzso 

zzso induced a statistically significant decline in mean zzso cell numbers in patients who achieved disease control, whereas no effect was seen in those who had zzso In contrast, no in zzso effect of zzso incubation was zzso 

This preliminary study would suggest that zzso may exert in zzso an zzso action on zzso cell generation in cancer patients which is associated with a control of the zzso zzso whereas no direct effect was seen in zzso on zzso zzso This finding would suggest that zzso may counteract zzso cell generation in zzso by zzso zzso activity which is involved in stimulating zzso cell zzso
