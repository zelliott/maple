The methodology of zzso studies that use a lifetime perspective is based on the zzso to zzso of the survival zzso However, the research in this zzso area is at an initial zzso zzso adequate techniques for survival curve zzso still need to be devised for handling the different clinical settings that can be zzso by zzso survival zzso After a brief overview of the two most commonly used zzso methods zzso zzso model and zzso zzso we describe a new method for expressing lifetime survival in zzso studies that evaluate cancer zzso Our method zzso to zzso a traditional survival curve by assigning a normal life expectancy to patients (or long-term zzso In this way, the value of mean lifetime survival zzso for the patient cohort under study can be determined using a lifetime zzso This value can be employed in lifetime zzso analyses that compare different forms of intervention for that disease zzso A separate section of our method compares the overall survival pattern of cured and not cured patients with that of a reference healthy population to assess the impact of the disease on life zzso As an example of the application of our method, we zzso a survival data set reported by zzso et al in 1992, that refers to patients with acute zzso who relapsed after their first zzso bone zzso transplantation and who received a second transplant zzso mean age at zzso zzso 26 zzso The use of our zzso method provided the following zzso zzso for zzso patients zzso zzso months per patient or zzso years per zzso zzso for the reference cohort of healthy subjects zzso zzso months per patient or zzso years per zzso We conclude that the zzso technique described zzso can be useful to handle lifetime survival data in zzso zzso
