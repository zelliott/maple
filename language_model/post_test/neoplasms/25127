zzso engineering has led to a significantly improved understanding of the zzso properties of proteins and, importantly, of the molecular mechanisms of zzso Moreover, it has enabled scientists to modify the molecular characteristics of peptides and zzso leading to improved zzso and zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or vaccines, contribute increasingly to clinical zzso Some of these new treatments have dramatically changed the outcome of specific zzso However, treatment options remain limited in many conditions, particularly in zzso disease, despite a zzso understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso With the successful zzso development of therapeutic zzso the most significant barrier prior to zzso into clinical practice is proof of concept in zzso This is in part addressed by clinical trials that evaluate the zzso dose response and efficacy of the zzso This zzso study zzso the current state of zzso in clinical trials and provides a particular focus on zzso zzso It identifies those cancer types that are most likely to benefit from the efforts made in zzso protein science and establishes evidence that engineered proteins and peptides are set to play a growing role in clinical zzso This study was based on the zzso trials registered on the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Database by 31 August zzso Of these, zzso trials assigned to cancer conditions, including zzso and lymphoma, were further zzso with a particular focus on the zzso zzso trials that were based on biological zzso The inclusion criterion for the analysis was registration on the Clinical Trials Database by the above zzso No other trials were zzso zzso were the more prevalent intervention in cancer trials zzso compared with trials in zzso conditions zzso Further zzso analysis based on the 20 cancer zzso with the highest mortality revealed that biological zzso comprise zzso in zzso melanoma trials and more than zzso in five other cancer zzso zzso of all zzso zzso are registered in cancer trials zzso zzso of all cancer zzso The zzso analysis demonstrated a predominance of zzso and zzso trials for zzso interventions, with 204 and zzso trials zzso zzso In zzso conditions only zzso zzso trials investigate zzso zzso zzso A retrospective zzso analysis of the trials demonstrated that zzso zzso trials are increasingly frequently registered in zzso as well as cancer zzso However, zzso trials continue to be registered more frequently only in zzso conditions, but have come to a plateau in zzso This study is limited by analysis of data from one database zzso While the zzso Clinical Trials Database used is the most comprehensive and internationally zzso of its kind, it is possible that the results may have been modified if other databases were also zzso zzso engineering has paved the way for zzso clinical zzso A zzso analysis of trials registered on the zzso Clinical Trial Database shows that biological interventions are increasingly entered into clinical zzso While zzso diseases used to lead this effort, zzso trials in zzso conditions have now become more frequent in zzso zzso zzso however, are still mainly investigated in zzso zzso zzso diseases are most frequently investigated for zzso interventions, although they are not among the eight most common causes of cancer zzso This may reflect the fact that zzso research, understanding of molecular mechanisms and target identification in other zzso and diseases is less zzso
