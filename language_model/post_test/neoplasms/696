The emergence of drug resistance remains a fundamental challenge in the development of zzso zzso that are effective over long-term zzso zzso zzso that bind to sites lying outside the highly zzso zzso pocket are thought to be more selective than zzso zzso and may circumvent some mechanisms of drug zzso Crystal structures of type I and zzso type III zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso allowed us to employ principles of zzso design to develop these scaffolds into potent type II zzso zzso One of these compounds, zzso zzso zzso zzso focal zzso in cancer cells via direct zzso of zzso Details gleaned from crystal structures revealed a key feature of a subset of these compounds, a surprising flexibility in the vicinity of the gatekeeper zzso that allows these compounds to overcome a zzso gatekeeper zzso emerging in zzso
