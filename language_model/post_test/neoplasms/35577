zzso appropriate zzso data sources is a key consideration in health services and outcomes zzso 

Using cancer patients as an example, we compared zzso conditions zzso 1) on the discharge zzso versus full hospital medical record and 2) in the hospital record versus Medicare claims, both zzso diagnosis and associated with a cancer zzso index zzso 

We used data from 1995 zzso zzso and End zzso patterns of care studies for zzso zzso zzso conditions were zzso from the hospital record associated with the most definitive cancer treatment and Medicare zzso We calculated the prevalence for and assessed zzso among 12 conditions derived from the hospital record zzso full hospital record; Medicare claims zzso diagnosis, with and without a zzso zzso zzso and Medicare claims associated with an index zzso 

The proportion of patients with one or more zzso conditions varied by data source, from zzso for the zzso to zzso for zzso Medicare claims without the zzso zzso zzso zzso were substantially lower for the zzso compared with the full hospital zzso For zzso Medicare claims, condition zzso were more than zzso times greater in the absence of an zzso to screen for zzso zzso zzso assessing zzso between the full hospital record and zzso Medicare claims zzso zzso zzso showed modest zzso 

The hospital record and Medicare claims are complementary data sources for identifying zzso zzso zzso is greatly zzso when derived only from the zzso of the hospital zzso Investigators using Part B Medicare claims to measure zzso should remove conditions that are listed for purposes of generating bills but are not true zzso
