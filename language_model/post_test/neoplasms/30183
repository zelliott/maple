zzso experimental evidence suggests that zzso light exposure may imprint zzso clocks with lasting effects on the alignment and the stability of zzso rhythms later in zzso Assuming that exposure to light early in life could determine the stability of an zzso zzso system later in life, the present hypothesis proposes that time of year and location of birth zzso season and zzso and thus differential zzso strengths may be key contributors to a person's zzso of developing mood disorders like seasonal affective disorder zzso and common internal zzso such as those of breast and zzso zzso when and where people are born might critically zzso them to both mood disorders and internal zzso and may affect the onset and course of such zzso This paper develops a zzso framework and presents suggestions for rigorous tests of the associated zzso and zzso It does not escape our attention that links between the zzso zzso strength of light and its effects on the stability of zzso systems later in life could have a role to play in affecting long-term health beyond cancer and mood disorders - mostly in adults but also in zzso
