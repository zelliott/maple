The leader zzso of a zzso zzso zzso constitutes the carrier that allows zzso to penetrate tumor zzso A synthetic preparation of zzso was zzso labeled zzso zzso and injected into animals bearing spontaneous zzso zzso followed by PET zzso which demonstrated zzso the tumor sites in all the animals, suggesting that if zzso was able to transport the zzso into tumor cells, it would also be able to deliver zzso zzso The zzso was, therefore, zzso to zzso zzso and added to cultured tumor zzso Equal zzso of zzso were used for the zzso After treating the zzso cancer cells with zzso zzso of zzso alone, analysis by atomic zzso zzso was able to detect only 6 zzso of zzso whereas when the same cells were treated with the same amount of zzso zzso to leader zzso zzso zzso zzso of platinum were zzso zzso an amount 80 times zzso Only the tumor cells died following treatment with zzso molecular analysis revealed that its addition generated an increasing expression of zzso and zzso products, which could be inhibited only by a selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso revealing that zzso has an zzso function, exactly as occurs when using the zzso zzso Data are statistically significant and indicate that by using zzso the zzso can be transformed from an agent with zzso activity into a specific and selective zzso zzso increasing its therapeutic zzso We think that zzso deserves to be considered as a new zzso zzso
