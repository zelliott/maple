zzso availability plays a critical role in cancer progression and is correlated with poor zzso Despite this connection, the independent effects of oxygen zzso on tumor zzso have not been zzso To address this, we developed an oxygen delivery device that uses zzso to generate oxygen directly underneath three-dimensional tumor zzso composed of colon zzso zzso The extent of cell death was measured using zzso zzso zzso oxygen for 60 h eliminated the zzso region typically found in the center of zzso despite the continued presence of other zzso zzso A mathematical model of zzso growth showed that the rate of cell death was more sensitive to oxygen than the growth zzso After zzso a ring of dead cells was observed at the outside edge of zzso and dead cells were observed moving outward from zzso zzso This movement suggests that dead cells were pushed by viable cells zzso in response to oxygen zzso a mechanism that may connect transient oxygen zzso to zzso zzso These zzso show that oxygen zzso are a primary factor governing cell viability and rearrange cells in zzso
