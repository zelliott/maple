Increasingly, computer simulation models are used for economic and policy evaluation in cancer prevention and zzso A zzso predictions of key zzso such as screening effectiveness, depend on the values of zzso natural history zzso zzso is the process of determining the values of zzso parameters by constraining model output to replicate observed zzso Because there are many approaches for model zzso and little consensus on best practices, we surveyed the literature to zzso the use and reporting of these methods in cancer simulation zzso We conducted a zzso search zzso through 2006) for articles on zzso models and supplemented search results with articles from our personal reference zzso For each article, two authors independently zzso zzso items using a standard zzso Data items included cancer site, model type, methods used for determination of zzso zzso values and description of any zzso zzso All authors reached consensus on items of zzso zzso and zzso models were zzso Articles describing zzso models, which estimate parameters with statistical approaches zzso maximum zzso were zzso zzso Models that included zzso parameters were zzso and classified by whether zzso methods were reported and if so, the methods zzso The review process yielded 154 articles that met our inclusion criteria and, of these, we concluded that 131 may have used zzso methods to determine model zzso Although the term zzso was not always used, descriptions of zzso or zzso zzso were found in 50% zzso zzso zzso of the articles, with an additional zzso zzso zzso zzso providing a reference to zzso zzso target data were identified in nearly all of these zzso Other zzso details, such as the zzso zzso were discussed in zzso zzso zzso 47 of zzso of the articles reporting zzso methods, while few details were provided on the zzso used to search the zzso zzso Our review shows that the use of cancer simulation zzso is zzso although thorough descriptions of zzso procedures are rare in the published literature for these zzso zzso is a key component of model development and is central to the zzso and credibility of subsequent analyses and zzso drawn from model zzso To aid zzso and facilitate discussion of zzso methods, we propose a standardized zzso Reporting zzso for model zzso
