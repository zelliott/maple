The development of zzso is a complex, zzso process that remains poorly zzso To identify proteins involved in the colonization phase of the zzso process, we compared the zzso of tumors derived from zzso of a panel of zzso human cancer cell lines with different zzso capabilities into the zzso fat pad of zzso zzso Using a protein standard generated by zzso a total of 675 proteins were identified and 30 were zzso expressed between at least two of the zzso The protein standard contained the zzso of seven cell lines from multiple zzso origins and displayed superior features compared to standard zzso The expression of some proteins correlated with zzso capabilities, such as zzso zzso zzso II zzso and zzso zzso A, while the expression of zzso factor zzso correlated zzso to zzso zzso The expression of these proteins was zzso zzso and expression of zzso in clinical breast cancer samples was further shown to be altered in primary tumors versus corresponding zzso zzso zzso Our study demonstrates an improved strategy for quantitative comparison of an unlimited number of tumor zzso and provides novel insights into key proteins associated with the colonization phase of zzso zzso
