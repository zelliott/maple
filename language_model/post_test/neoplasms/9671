We propose a cellular zzso model of solid zzso growth, in which each cell is equipped with a zzso response zzso This network is zzso using a zzso artificial neural network, that takes environmental variables as an input and from these determines the cellular zzso as the zzso The response of the network is determined by connection weights and thresholds in the network, which are subject to zzso when the cells zzso As both available space and nutrients are limited resources for the zzso this gives rise to zzso evolution where only the zzso cells zzso Using this approach we have investigated the impact of the tissue oxygen concentration on the growth and evolutionary dynamics of the zzso The results show that the oxygen concentration affects the selection pressure, cell population diversity and zzso of the zzso A low oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a zzso with a fingered zzso that contains aggressive zzso with a small zzso potential, while a high oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a zzso with a round zzso containing less evolved zzso The tissue oxygen concentration thus affects the zzso at both the zzso level and on the zzso zzso
