To illustrate different perspectives on response shift with cancer patients' zzso zzso zzso zzso In measurement perspective, the focus is on bias in the measurement of zzso In conceptual perspective, the focus is on bias in the explanation of zzso 

Data came from a consecutive series of 202 newly diagnosed cancer patients, zzso to cancer site, all undergoing zzso A zzso questionnaire was administered before and after zzso Using structural equation zzso biases and response shifts in measurement and explanation of zzso were investigated with respect to patient's cancer site, health status, sex, age, optimism, and social zzso 

Six measurement biases were found, five of which were considered response zzso The zzso zzso zzso scale appeared most susceptible to response zzso For example, zzso scores were not fully determined by zzso but also by optimism before surgery and female sex and downward social comparison after zzso Additionally, two explanation biases were found, neither of which were considered response zzso and after surgery the mental component of zzso was not only affected by cancer site and health status but also by optimism and downward social zzso 

Our approach enables the distinction and testing of biases and response shifts in the measurement and explanation of zzso
