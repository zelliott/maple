Human tumor zzso recognized by T cells have been identified by means of various molecular biological and zzso methods, including zzso expression cloning with patients' T cells and zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso differential display, systematic gene analysis such as DNA sequencing, zzso DNA zzso and zzso in zzso T cell induction and zzso of zzso transgenic zzso The identification of human tumor zzso has led to a better understanding of the nature of tumor zzso zzso immune responses in patients before and after zzso and tumor escape zzso The information obtained from these researches has enabled us to develop and improve zzso by attempting to overcome the identified problems, including zzso low zzso of tumor zzso and several escape mechanisms, such as regulatory T cell zzso The existence of zzso unique zzso derived from genetic zzso in tumor cells, and the varied zzso of shared tumor zzso among patients due to differing expression in tumor cells and zzso of patients, indicates that individualized zzso should zzso be zzso The identified zzso will also be useful for development of diagnostic methods and molecular targeting therapy for zzso
