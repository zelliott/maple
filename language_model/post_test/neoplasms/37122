A method is described for generating an external spiked human zzso control to enhance the reliability of assessment of gene expression in zzso zzso zzso with an external standard zzso controls for all subsequent steps of analysis on a lane by lane basis and allows for uniform comparison of the gene of interest as a fraction of total zzso particularly when multiple samples are not zzso The zzso probe that is being used to detect zzso gene expression is also used as an external zzso A sense zzso is made from the same zzso Because of the zzso zzso zzso sites incorporated in both zzso zzso with the sense zzso at a much lower concentration than the zzso probe generates a larger product that can be readily separated from the zzso protected zzso This method is generally zzso to any zzso that has a zzso and zzso zzso zzso site and allows any zzso added zzso use for assessing zzso gene expression to be used as the external spike zzso
