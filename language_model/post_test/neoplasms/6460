zzso zzso of serum proteins and zzso fatty acids zzso often accompany zzso zzso Free zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were measured by equilibrium dialysis in serum samples obtained from 31 patients with cancer and 18 control zzso Mean fu values of both drugs were significantly higher in the patient zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and age for zzso accounted for zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso variation in zzso drug concentration ratios in the group of patients with zzso The interactions of zzso and zzso with zzso were further zzso the more avid site had association zzso of zzso X zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso Finally, it is strongly suggested that when zzso is present and a drug binds to zzso with an affinity constant comparable to or higher than that to zzso then fu will become dependent on the concentration of zzso
