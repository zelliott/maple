Current estimates of the costs of cancer care in the United States are based on data from 2003 and zzso However, zzso survival, and practice patterns have been changing for the majority of zzso 

Cancer prevalence was estimated and projected by phase of care zzso year following diagnosis, continuing, and last year of life) and tumor site for 13 zzso in men and 16 zzso in women through zzso Cancer prevalence was calculated from cancer zzso and survival models estimated from zzso zzso and End zzso zzso Program zzso zzso net costs were estimated from recent zzso linkage data, which included claims through 2006 among beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with a cancer zzso Control subjects without cancer were identified from a zzso random sample of all Medicare beneficiaries residing in the zzso areas to adjust for expenditures not related to zzso All cost estimates were adjusted to 2010 zzso Different scenarios for assumptions about future trends in zzso survival, and cost were assessed with sensitivity zzso 

Assuming constant zzso survival, and cost, we projected zzso and zzso million cancer survivors in 2010 and 2020, respectively, with associated costs of cancer care of zzso and zzso billion 2010 US zzso This zzso increase in medical costs reflects US population changes zzso The largest increases were in the continuing phase of care for prostate cancer zzso and female breast cancer zzso zzso of current trends in zzso zzso and survival zzso had small effects on 2020 zzso However, if costs of care increase annually by zzso in the initial and last year of life zzso of care, the total cost in 2020 is projected to be zzso billion, which represents a zzso increase from zzso 

The national cost of cancer care is substantial and expected to increase because of population changes zzso Our findings have implications for policy makers in planning and allocation of zzso
