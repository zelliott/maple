zzso a zzso strain of zzso disease virus, causes zzso of tumor zzso after intravenous zzso This phase I study was designed to define the zzso dose zzso and safety of single and multiple intravenous doses of zzso as a single agent in patients with zzso 

zzso patients with advanced solid zzso that were unresponsive to standard therapy were zzso Four zzso intravenous dosing regimens were zzso zzso single zzso one dose every 28 zzso zzso repeat zzso three doses in 1 week every 28 zzso zzso zzso one lower dose followed by two higher doses in 1 week every 28 zzso and zzso two week: one lower dose followed by five higher doses over 2 weeks every 21 zzso 

A zzso dose zzso was achieved over 195 zzso A zzso zzso of 12 zzso zzso zzso units zzso was established for zzso zzso After an initial dose of 12 zzso zzso zzso patients tolerated an zzso for subsequent doses of 120 zzso zzso zzso The most common adverse events were zzso symptoms that occurred principally after the first dose and were decreased in number and severity with each subsequent zzso zzso zzso adverse events and acute dosing reactions were also observed but not cumulative zzso zzso responses occurred at higher dose levels, and zzso survival ranged from 4 to 31 zzso zzso tissue from one patient was obtained after 11 months of therapy and showed evidence of zzso particles budding from the tumor cell membrane by electron zzso and a pronounced zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso warrants further study as a novel therapeutic agent for cancer zzso
