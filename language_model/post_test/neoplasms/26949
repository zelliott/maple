zzso prediction is dependent on many choices ranging from the sample collection and prediction zzso to the choice of zzso and its zzso Here we studied the effects of such choices, exemplified by predicting sensitivity (as zzso of cancer cell lines towards a variety of zzso For this, we used three independent sample collections and applied several machine learning zzso for predicting a variety of zzso for drug zzso We compared all possible models for combinations of sample collections, algorithm, drug, and labeling to an zzso generated zzso zzso The predictability of treatment effects varies among compounds, zzso response could be predicted for some but not for zzso The choice of sample collection plays a major role towards lowering the prediction error, as does sample zzso However, we found that no zzso was able to consistently outperform the other and there was no significant difference between zzso and two- or three class zzso in this experimental zzso These results indicate that zzso projects should direct efforts mainly towards sample collection and data quality, rather than method zzso
