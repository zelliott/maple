Identification of zzso zzso in cancer is a major goal for understanding and monitoring the events related to cancer initiation and zzso High resolution melting zzso curve analysis represents a fast, zzso zzso method for scanning zzso sequence zzso in target zzso The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of zzso analysis for tumor zzso screening in a range of tumor samples, which included 216 frozen pediatric small rounded zzso tumors as well as 180 zzso tumors from breast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis was performed in zzso of the following candidate genes known to harbor established commonly observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequencing analysis was used to determine the accuracy of the zzso zzso For the 39 zzso observed in frozen samples, the sensitivity and specificity of zzso analysis were zzso and zzso zzso There were 67 zzso in the zzso samples, and the sensitivity and specificity for the zzso analysis were zzso and zzso zzso zzso samples require higher quantity of zzso DNA for high zzso In zzso zzso analysis is a promising zzso screening test for zzso among known candidate zzso zzso Although the overall accuracy appears to be better in frozen zzso zzso zzso were detected in DNA extracted from zzso zzso
