zzso zzso cells zzso have been widely used in cancer zzso but show significant zzso zzso and low capacity for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso T cells, greatly limiting the success of this zzso Given recent developments in induced zzso and the relative ease with which induced zzso stem zzso cell lines may be generated from individuals, we have succeeded in zzso zzso cells zzso from human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso DC zzso using protocols zzso with their subsequent clinical zzso Unlike zzso a subset of zzso was found to zzso zzso and zzso that have been shown previously to define the human equivalent of mouse zzso DC, in which the capacity for zzso has been shown to zzso zzso zzso were able to zzso the zzso zzso A, to a zzso zzso clone and stimulate primary zzso zzso responses among zzso T cells from an zzso zzso Given that zzso DC are present in peripheral blood in trace numbers that zzso their clinical application, the ability to generate a potentially unlimited source from zzso cells offers the possibility of harnessing their capacity for zzso of zzso T zzso for the induction of zzso immune zzso
