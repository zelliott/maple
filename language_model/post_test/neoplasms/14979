zzso on recent progress in control of matter at the zzso functional zzso and drug zzso are being actively developed with the promise of improved delivery of therapeutic zzso zzso drug delivery approaches usually aim at reducing the systemic distribution and associated zzso typically observed with conventional zzso molecules as well as increasing the therapeutic index of the active zzso The enhanced zzso and retention effect has been exploited with notable success to passively deliver zzso drug carriers and therapeutic zzso in zzso Strategies aimed at further enhancing the zzso zzso within tumor zzso are under intensive investigation and could zzso in a not too distant future, the realization of the long sought after goal of chemotherapy without - or with reduced - zzso In particular, zzso approaches are widely predicted to offer much greater specificity towards the target cells and zzso Advancement in molecular biology has indeed made a wealth of information available in biological processes and application of this new knowledge to zzso agents, has also generated unprecedented hope of novel molecular diagnostic and therapeutic zzso Focusing on zzso applications, this review aims to discuss the recent developments in zzso of functional zzso and drug zzso and the integration of these systems into clinically relevant therapeutic zzso
