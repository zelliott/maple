Drug development in zzso finds itself at the zzso of unique opportunities and major zzso The old zzso should and can be replaced by a system that better matches the right patients to the right compounds and puts much more emphasis on the early stages of drug zzso 

The clinical zzso of drug development will no longer be split into phase I, II, and III studies, but rather into zzso target pharmacology zzso followed by zzso of concept zzso The resulting development flow becomes zzso zzso 

Although zzso studies will still be needed for drugs using targets in the tumor environment, or for combinations of agents, drug registration might proceed without these if all of the following criteria are met in early development: availability of zzso convincing evidence that the drug's target is the functional driver behind the disease zzso availability of a zzso zzso that enables appropriate and actual patient selection in early pharmacology studies, a Response zzso zzso In Solid zzso zzso single agent response rate of at least zzso and/or a progression at first tumor assessment rate of zzso or less, a duration of absence of progression zzso disease) beyond doubt and considered clinically relevant, and no major safety zzso This set is not yet mature, but may be adapted over zzso The concerns related to registering agents on the basis of small zzso can be adequately addressed by obligatory zzso hypothesis driven zzso
