Cancer zzso mortality and survival statistics for the UK are routinely zzso however, data on zzso which is generally regarded as an important measure for health planning and resource zzso are relatively zzso 

Eight cancer zzso in the zzso covering more than half the population, provided data based on zzso million cases of zzso Total prevalence was calculated using methods developed for the zzso study, based on zzso zzso and survival zzso The prevalence of zzso of the stomach, zzso zzso zzso breast (in zzso zzso zzso corpus zzso and zzso melanoma of skin, Hodgkin's disease, zzso and all zzso zzso combined, was estimated for the UK for the end of zzso 

Overall, approximately zzso of males and zzso of females in the UK population at the end of 1992 were living with a diagnosis of zzso These proportions increased steeply with age, with approximately zzso zzso and zzso in males and zzso zzso of people aged zzso or zzso years living with a diagnosis of zzso Of the individual zzso by far the highest prevalence zzso zzso was seen for breast cancer in zzso more than one in three of all living female cancer patients had been diagnosed with breast zzso For zzso around half of prevalent cases had been diagnosed zzso years previously and zzso zzso years zzso for zzso these figures were both higher, at approximately zzso and zzso zzso 

The estimates of prevalence presented here zzso recently diagnosed patients in need of treatment and zzso long-term survivors, some of whom will nevertheless eventually die from the cancer, while others may be cured of the zzso and patients in the terminal phase who are dying from the zzso Further work should attempt to identify the proportions of patients in the different zzso of care in order to zzso the use of prevalence estimates in health care zzso
