The zzso response of the zzso zzso drug zzso zzso was investigated in zzso and compared with that of zzso zzso zzso immortalized zzso B14 and zzso zzso cells were used in the experiments as a model for cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of cell proliferation zzso by the zzso growth and zzso methods were estimated to compare the efficacy of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and their death after zzso exposure to zzso laser zzso Green zzso zzso zzso or red semiconductor zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso were zzso Different zzso of both cell lines to zzso and zzso were found so that the zzso of zzso was considerably greater than the zzso of zzso zzso response zzso zzso zzso was observed only for B14 cells after zzso with zzso Under the same conditions no significant effect of red light zzso zzso 670 zzso zzso on survival of both cell lines treated with zzso was zzso
