The purpose of this study was to investigate the theory of planned zzso zzso zzso hypothesis between the zzso model of personality and exercise zzso using an extended zzso model including concepts of affective and instrumental attitude, zzso and descriptive norm, zzso and zzso It was hypothesized that zzso activity facet would have a significant direct effect on exercise zzso while controlling for the zzso based on the zzso that activity may represent a disposition that predicts exercise beyond planned zzso 

To test the zzso of these findings, we examined this research question with undergraduate students zzso and cancer survivors, using a zzso zzso 

Using structural equation zzso the results indicated that activity had a significant effect zzso zzso on exercise zzso zzso 1 zzso study 2 zzso while controlling for the zzso 

This study suggests the importance of zzso activity facet on exercise zzso even when controlling for a zzso model with additional zzso concepts and disparate population zzso
