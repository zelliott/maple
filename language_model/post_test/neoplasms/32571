The use of zzso or infrared photons is a promising approach for biomedical imaging in living zzso This technology often requires zzso contrast agents with combinations of zzso diameter, zzso quantum yield and stability that are not possible with conventional organic zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso of type II quantum dots can be tuned into the near infrared while preserving zzso zzso and that a zzso zzso coating renders them zzso disperse and stable in zzso We then demonstrate that these quantum dots allow a major cancer surgery, zzso zzso zzso zzso to be performed in large animals under complete image zzso zzso of only 400 zzso of zzso quantum dots permits zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso deep to be zzso easily in real time using zzso zzso rates of only 5 zzso Taken together, the chemical, optical and in zzso data presented in this study demonstrate the potential of zzso quantum dots for biomedical zzso
