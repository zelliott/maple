The product of the zzso zzso gene zzso is a key regulator of cell proliferation and this function is thought to be central to its tumor zzso zzso Several studies have demonstrated that zzso of zzso not only allows inappropriate proliferation but also undermines zzso zzso leading to zzso instability and zzso zzso Such properties promote tumor evolution and correlate with increased resistance to zzso and tumor zzso These observations suggest that zzso of zzso could contribute to both tumor initiation and zzso Further characterization of the role of zzso in zzso segregation will provide insight into processes that are zzso in human tumors and could reveal new therapeutic targets to kill or stall these zzso unstable zzso We review the evidence that zzso promotes zzso stability and discuss the mechanisms that probably contribute to this zzso
