In recent years, targeted therapies for zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown initial promise in the clinical setting for the treatment of several tumors driven by these zzso signaling zzso Unfortunately, clinical zzso due to acquired resistance to these molecular zzso is zzso An improved understanding of how tumors bypass the zzso effects of zzso therapies has revealed a rich myriad of possible mechanisms for acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can function as zzso or tumor zzso to either enhance or suppress zzso zzso Recent studies suggest that the loss or gain of function of zzso can significantly impinge on zzso signaling during tumor zzso Here we review the interplay between zzso and zzso as an emerging mechanism for acquired resistance to zzso therapies, that may aid in the design of improved therapies to prevent and overcome resistance in treatments for cancer zzso
