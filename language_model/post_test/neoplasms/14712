A substantial fraction of sporadic and inherited zzso and zzso zzso in humans is deficient in DNA mismatch repair zzso These zzso are characterized by length zzso in ubiquitous simple sequence repeats, a zzso called zzso zzso Here we have exploited this zzso by developing a novel approach for the highly selective gene therapy of zzso zzso To achieve this zzso we zzso the zzso suicide gene by inserting an zzso zzso within its coding zzso We show that in a significant fraction of zzso zzso cells carrying the zzso suicide zzso full-length protein becomes expressed within a few cell zzso presumably resulting from a reverting zzso within the inserted zzso Treatment of these cells with the innocuous zzso zzso zzso zzso strong zzso and we demonstrate that this owes to multiple bystander effects zzso by the suicide zzso zzso In a mouse model, zzso tumors that contained the zzso zzso gene displayed strong zzso after treatment with zzso without any obvious adverse systemic effects to the zzso By virtue of its high selectivity and zzso this conditional zzso combination may hold promise for the treatment or prevention of zzso cancer in zzso
