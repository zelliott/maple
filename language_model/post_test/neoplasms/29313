A growing body of evidence points toward activated zzso also known as zzso as one of the leading zzso in several major human zzso including zzso zzso disorders, invasive tumor growth, zzso arthritis, and zzso zzso Type C2 zzso protein has been recently identified as a product of the second gene in zzso zzso It encodes zzso highly zzso zzso protein with the poorly defined zzso Here we show that zzso zzso in human zzso zzso their zzso The zzso phenomenon was not limited to zzso as it was also observed in zzso smooth muscle cells upon zzso zzso gene by zzso More importantly, activated zzso zzso isolated from patients with zzso arthritis were also identified as zzso at both the zzso zzso and protein zzso The molecular mechanism responsible for zzso of zzso cells was shown to be a sustained zzso of zzso 1/2 zzso protein zzso zzso which fulfills both the sufficient and necessary zzso zzso zzso All of these findings highlight a novel mechanism where zzso by zzso regulating zzso 1/2 zzso zzso may efficiently suppress development of zzso tissue zzso and zzso
