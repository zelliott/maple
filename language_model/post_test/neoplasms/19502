zzso and accurate cancer zzso is critical in cancer zzso Gene expression profiling is expected to enable us to diagnose tumors precisely and zzso However, the zzso task in this context is very challenging because of the curse of zzso and the small sample size zzso In this paper, we propose a novel method to solve these two zzso Our method is able to map gene expression data into a very low zzso space and thus meets the recommended samples to features per class zzso As a result, it can be used to zzso new samples robustly with low and zzso zzso error zzso The method is based on linear zzso analysis zzso However, the conventional zzso requires that the zzso scatter zzso zzso be zzso Unfortunately, zzso is always singular in the case of cancer zzso due to the small sample size zzso To overcome this problem, we develop a generalized linear zzso analysis zzso that is a general, zzso and complete solution to zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso with the conventional zzso when zzso is zzso Different from the conventional zzso zzso does not assume the zzso of zzso and thus naturally zzso the small sample size zzso To accommodate the high zzso of scatter zzso a fast zzso of zzso is also zzso Our extensive experiments on seven public cancer zzso show that the method performs zzso Especially on some difficult instances that have very small samples to genes per class ratios, our method achieves much higher zzso than widely used zzso methods such as support zzso machines, random forests, zzso
