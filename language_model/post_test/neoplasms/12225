It is well recognized that the season of the year exerts an influence on some diseases and causes of death such as coronary heart diseases, stroke, infectious diseases and so zzso 

We evaluated the influence of seasonal changes on diseases and causes of death in Japan using the Japan Vital Statistics from 1970 to 1999 and recorded weather data zzso zzso by a zzso decomposition in a log linear zzso zzso 

Major influences of seasonal change with the highest rates in winter were seen on the zzso the overall causes of zzso infectious and zzso diseases including zzso respiratory disease, including pneumonia and zzso heart and cerebrovascular diseases; zzso and zzso diseases and zzso Two zzso were seen in suicides, a large peak in April and a small peak in zzso Cancer and homicides were little or not at all influenced by zzso There was no major difference in changes between the years zzso except for respiratory disease and zzso which showed a clear reduction in the zzso effect from 1970 to zzso 

To reduce the overall mortality rate and to prolong life expectancy in Japan, measures must be taken to reduce those mortality rates associated with seasonal differences, especially those causes of death which show a strong correlation with seasonal change: zzso heart, zzso diabetes and infectious zzso
