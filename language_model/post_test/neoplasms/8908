The clinical use of the efficient zzso drug zzso is limited by its specific severe organ zzso such as zzso zzso and also peripheral zzso zzso zzso such as the copper zzso zzso the copper zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the organic zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso mediate cellular transport of zzso Since zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso its role as possible target of specific organ protection against zzso zzso toxicity is under zzso We could show that zzso is also expressed in the zzso in hair cells and in cells of the zzso zzso and also in zzso root zzso of zzso Moreover, we could show in a mouse model of zzso acute zzso that the expression of zzso is critical for the development of zzso peripheral zzso and zzso Competition of zzso transport by the zzso zzso zzso was able to suppress zzso and reduce zzso Only few human tumors express zzso its expression being apparently zzso by zzso zzso suggesting that a protective therapy by competition for the transport of zzso by zzso may be generally feasible without affecting its zzso zzso There is already some evidence that patients bearing a zzso in zzso gene or zzso with zzso are protected against zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso seems to be an ideal target for the establishment of protective therapies aimed to specifically reduce zzso zzso and increase the quality of life of the zzso
