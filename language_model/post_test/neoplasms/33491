zzso zzso are zzso naturally occurring zzso surrogates that are fully compatible with live organisms, including humans in a clinical zzso The ability to enrich common compounds with rare zzso such as carbon zzso and nitrogen zzso is the only practical means by which zzso pathways can be zzso performed by following the fate of individual atoms from the source molecules to products via zzso zzso Changes in regulation of pathways are therefore captured by this approach, which leads to deeper understanding of fundamental zzso of cancer compared with zzso cells, which can lead to new diagnostic zzso
