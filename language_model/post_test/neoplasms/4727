zzso is a multifaceted protein that zzso multiple activities in the cell, one of which is the preservation of zzso zzso a vital process that takes place in the context of the base zzso repair zzso zzso Studies have implicated zzso in rendering zzso cells less vulnerable to the effects of zzso agents that are commonly used for the treatment of zzso Furthermore, suppression of zzso expression in cancer cell lines is accompanied by the zzso of the activity of zzso zzso As a result, major efforts have been directed towards the identification of zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso we review all patented zzso zzso zzso reported prior to zzso Unfortunately, the potency and selectivity of many of the reported zzso were not disclosed by the original authors, and at present it is unclear if zzso is a bona fide target for many of the zzso zzso Moreover, cellular activity and toxicity of many zzso remain to be zzso Since this is the first comprehensive review of small zzso zzso zzso we present all compounds reported to inhibit zzso activity with an zzso value zzso 25 zzso Efforts towards a careful validation and zzso of these compounds are zzso Furthermore, we explore potential zzso zzso sites on the protein as an alternative approach for modulating the activity of this zzso zzso In addition, we give an overview of zzso as well as other zzso zzso in some zzso zzso Finally, given the universal importance of DNA repair, as well as the considerable conservation of repair proteins across all living organisms, we propose targeting the zzso zzso activity of pathogens by the compounds discussed in this review, thereby expanding their therapeutic potential and zzso
