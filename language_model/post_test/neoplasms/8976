zzso evidence has accumulated to suggest that vitamin D may reduce the risk of cancer through its biologically active zzso zzso which zzso proliferation and zzso zzso differentiation and zzso and regulates many other cellular zzso Thus, it is plausible to assume that rapid clearance of zzso by highly expressed zzso could interrupt the normal physiology of cells and might be one cause of cancer initiation and zzso In fact, enhancement of zzso expression has been reported in literature for many zzso Based on these findings, zzso zzso and vitamin D zzso which are resistant to zzso zzso might be useful for cancer zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which is an zzso compound, markedly enhanced and prolonged the zzso activity of zzso in the human zzso Likewise, zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed potent biological zzso Our in zzso studies using rats revealed that zzso had a low zzso effect, which is a suitable property as an zzso zzso Much lower affinity of zzso for vitamin D binding protein zzso as compared with zzso may be related to its more potent cellular zzso Based on these results, we conclude that zzso high affinity for zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso low affinity for zzso and zzso low zzso effect may be required for designing potent vitamin D zzso for cancer zzso
