T cell zzso zzso has been identified as a marker of differentiated zzso zzso T helper type 1 and zzso T zzso type 1 zzso The interaction of zzso with its zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death, and in zzso blockade of this interaction results in exacerbated zzso and zzso of tolerance in experimental models, establishing zzso as a negative regulatory zzso Recent studies have uncovered additional mechanisms by which zzso zzso regulates T cell responses, such as promoting the development of zzso T cell exhaustion and inducing expansion of zzso zzso zzso In contrast to this zzso effect on T cells, zzso interaction promotes zzso clearance of zzso zzso Here, we focus on the emerging role for zzso in tumor and zzso zzso
