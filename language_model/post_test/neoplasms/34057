zzso of zzso has progressed from a theoretical and esoteric discipline scrutinized in but a few laboratories far removed from the clinic, to mainstream experimental clinical cancer zzso zzso progress in this field represents a triumph of the concept of zzso biomedical zzso Growth of knowledge in this discipline has brought to light a bewildering yet tantalizing array of interacting zzso zzso that participate in the highly orchestrated process of new blood vessel formation critical for tumor growth and zzso It is clear that pathways of blood zzso (in broad zzso and zzso are inextricably zzso The facts that much is already known about many components of these pathways and that zzso of tumor growth has already been demonstrated for several interventions aimed at participants in these reactions send a clear signal that more effective and less toxic cancer therapy may be at hand in the near zzso There is no lack of candidate targets for intervention brought to light by zzso zzso Numerous zzso zzso agents are on hand for zzso The challenge is clearly in the hands of the clinical investigators to proceed with human intervention studies while armed with knowledge of opportunities and pitfalls that should guide zzso clinical trial zzso A particularly compelling feature of this treatment paradigm is that it is not aimed directly at destruction of tumor through zzso of the DNA replication machinery of the zzso Rather it is aimed at restoring the normal state by modulating the zzso interaction of tumor cells with their environment that is characteristic of zzso
