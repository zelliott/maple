The ability to zzso isolate breast cancer cells that initiate tumors when transplanted zzso into zzso mice has led to an explosion of work characterizing these cells and establishing ways to target zzso zzso studies screening for novel targets and chemical library screens for effective therapies have implicated signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and possible even zzso zzso in the regulation of tumor initiating cell zzso Potential targeting agents including the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso interaction inhibitor zzso zzso resistance pump poison zzso zzso as well as targeted the dual zzso growth factor family inhibitor zzso and many more have all been found to have toxicity against purportedly chemotherapy resistant zzso of cancer cells often referred to as tumor initiating cells zzso Work using clinical samples is emerging and supports the hypothesis that zzso chemotherapy can enrich for zzso in residual disease, but strong correlation with long-term outcome is yet to be zzso This paper reviews current attempts to targeting zzso and discusses the competing hypotheses to explain breast cancer recurrence and therapy zzso
