There is growing interest in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso as an alternative to zzso DC zzso for zzso However, in contrast to zzso little is known regarding the effect of zzso on the function, abundance or use of zzso signaling pathways in zzso zzso the molecular detail of circulating zzso is therefore important for future use in advanced zzso Advanced cancer patients had similar numbers of circulating zzso to zzso patients and healthy individuals, and zzso similar levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso from some patients failed to zzso the zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso or zzso markedly increased zzso zzso by zzso This is in complete contrast to what is established for zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this was specific to zzso since zzso was suppressed by zzso in both DC zzso The opposing effect of zzso on zzso was evident at the zzso level and in both DC types was zzso through the zzso zzso but did not involve differential zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso where patient zzso did not zzso zzso (or after treatment with zzso melanoma zzso zzso restored zzso to normal zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the other zzso pathways had similar consequences in both DC zzso We show for the first time the differential use of a major zzso signaling zzso by zzso zzso there are sufficient circulating zzso in advanced cancer patients to consider development of adoptive zzso
