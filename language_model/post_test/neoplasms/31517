The zzso activity of zzso zzso a fluorinated zzso zzso obtained by reaction in zzso media, was evaluated in comparison with zzso against a series of zzso human zzso zzso The zzso studied were established from zzso zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso colon zzso zzso zzso central nervous system zzso small cell lung zzso and prostate zzso zzso or zzso was administered as four weekly zzso treatments, within dose ranges of zzso or zzso zzso zzso The overall zzso activity of zzso was superior to that of zzso zzso showed high activity against zzso and zzso zzso and moderate activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso achieving an overall response of zzso This contrasts with a zzso response with zzso which proved only moderately active against zzso and zzso zzso These results confirm and extend our previous report of the broad spectrum of in zzso zzso activity of zzso and reinforce its potential as a valuable addition to current zzso zzso
