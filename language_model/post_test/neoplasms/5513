We have proposed a preliminary model of how the zzso promoting complex functions throughout the cell cycle, but despite the flurry of recent publications characterizing the zzso zzso regulation and zzso zzso fundamental questions remain to be zzso zzso the remaining components of the zzso need to be identified and zzso We do not know if all zzso components are zzso in all zzso or if higher zzso having a more complicated cell cycle machinery, maintain additional zzso for more sophisticated functional and regulatory zzso In addition, we need to determine the identity of the various zzso and zzso that regulate the zzso zzso The zzso of individual zzso components is also a mystery, and a specific zzso function has not been assigned to any known members of the zzso It is not at all clear which zzso of the complex actually recognizes the zzso zzso and which zzso recognizes the zzso destruction zzso It is likely that many zzso zzso remain to be identified, and it will be interesting to determine whether all zzso zzso require a destruction box for their degradation or whether the zzso recognizes other zzso of protein zzso Finally, we assume that the zzso degrades zzso zzso in all zzso cells, but whether it degrades unique cell cycle related zzso in specific zzso is zzso Furthermore, nothing is known about zzso function during zzso or whether the zzso degrades other zzso that are not related to the cell zzso This is an exciting and rapidly developing field in the exciting world of cell cycle zzso We expect that new findings will surely reveal many interesting surprises about this essential protein zzso
