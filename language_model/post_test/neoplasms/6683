zzso zzso formation is a grave zzso sign, but zzso efforts seem justified in some zzso Lack of knowledge concerning the natural history of this process zzso the choice of therapeutic zzso Over 5 years, 107 patients with zzso zzso zzso were reviewed to define their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and colon zzso were the most frequent tumors, with zzso of patients presenting with zzso at the time of the initial cancer zzso zzso evaluation of the zzso fluid was positive for tumor cells in 57% of cases and a high protein content was noted in zzso Mean survival of the entire series was only 20 weeks from the time of diagnosis of zzso with tumors of zzso and zzso origin having better mean zzso of 32 and 58 weeks, zzso Patients with high zzso protein levels fared better than those with low zzso In an effort to explain this correlation of elevated protein levels and a favorable survival rate, a hypothesis was proposed that certain tumors zzso a factor, which alters vascular zzso and causes fluid zzso in the absence of zzso zzso In an experimental rat model of zzso zzso the zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso fluid caused an increase in zzso formation and a significant increase in zzso zzso to protein in the zzso This demonstrated change in the leak of protein explains the formation of zzso by some tumors in the absence of tumor obstruction of the draining zzso of the zzso cavity and suggests another important mechanism in the genesis of zzso zzso
