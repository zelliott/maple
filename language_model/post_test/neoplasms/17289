To investigate the quantitative and qualitative differences between combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso enhanced with contrast medium with either an zzso concentration 300 zzso or 370 zzso 

120 consecutive patients scheduled for zzso zzso zzso were zzso The first zzso 60 patients received contrast medium with 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso injection protocols were adapted for an identical zzso delivery rate zzso and body surface area zzso adapted zzso dose zzso zzso zzso and mean standardized zzso values zzso zzso and contrast enhancement zzso were determined in the ascending zzso the abdominal zzso the inferior zzso zzso the portal zzso the liver and the right kidney in the zzso contrast medium zzso PET data were evaluated visually for the presence of zzso and image zzso 

Both media caused significantly higher values for zzso zzso and zzso for the enhanced zzso than the zzso one (all zzso There were no significant differences in the degree of increase of zzso zzso and zzso between the two contrast media at any zzso site (all zzso Visual evaluation of zzso showed no differences between contrast and zzso zzso or between the two different contrast media zzso 

When using a constant zzso delivery rate and total zzso dose in a zzso adapted injection zzso there are no quantitative or qualitative differences in either CT or PET between contrast media with an zzso concentration of 300 zzso and 370 zzso zzso
