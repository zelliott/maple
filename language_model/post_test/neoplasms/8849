Not zzso a symptom as suspicious is a common reason given by cancer patients for delayed zzso but inevitably this is zzso We therefore investigated associations between recognition of warning signs for breast, zzso and lung cancer and anticipated time to zzso for symptoms of each zzso 

zzso telephone interviews were conducted with a zzso sample zzso of UK adults age zzso 50 years, using the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer zzso zzso time to zzso for persistent zzso zzso bleeding and breast changes was zzso as zzso vs zzso 2 zzso zzso of persistent zzso unexplained bleeding and unexplained lump as cancer warning signs was assessed zzso zzso between recognition and zzso were examined for each symptom controlling for demographics and perceived ease of health-care zzso 

For each zzso the odds of waiting for zzso weeks were significantly increased in those who did not zzso the related warning sign: breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso persistent zzso zzso zzso independent of demographics and health-care zzso 

zzso of warning signs was associated with anticipating faster zzso for potential symptoms of zzso Strategies to improve recognition are likely to facilitate earlier zzso
