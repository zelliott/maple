zzso interference zzso is a specific zzso mechanism that can be zzso by the delivery of chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might constitute a novel therapeutic approach for cancer treatment because researchers can easily design zzso molecules to zzso specifically and zzso the expression of any protein involved in tumor initiation and zzso Despite all the potential of zzso as a novel class of drugs, the limited cellular zzso low biological stability, and zzso zzso of zzso have limited their application in the zzso Indeed, blood zzso easily degrade naked zzso and the zzso rapidly eliminate these zzso Furthermore, at the level of target cells, the negative charge and zzso of zzso strongly impair their cellular zzso zzso the translation of zzso to the clinical setting is highly dependent on the development of an appropriate delivery system, able to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this regard, major advances have been achieved with zzso zzso zzso stabilized by zzso zzso zzso such as the stabilized zzso acid zzso particles zzso However, zzso has not solved all the major problems associated with zzso zzso In this Account, the major problems associated with zzso zzso zzso and the different strategies to overcome them are zzso Although zzso has revolutionized the field of zzso cumulative experience has revealed that upon repeated administration, zzso zzso lose their ability to circulate over long periods in the zzso a phenomenon known as accelerated blood zzso In addition, zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso into the target cell and its subsequent escape from the zzso pathway, which reduces biological zzso An interesting approach to overcome such limitations relies on the design of novel zzso zzso zzso After systemic administration, these lipids can be released from the zzso zzso Moreover, the design and synthesis of novel zzso lipids that are more zzso and the use of zzso targeting zzso have contributed to the emergence of novel zzso zzso with remarkable zzso zzso
