In the past decade, the discovery and characterization of zzso zzso zzso the engine zzso of the cell cycle machinery, have advanced our understanding of the cell zzso Both positive and negative regulators of zzso have been zzso accelerating the important research to unravel the mechanisms of the cell cycle zzso Cancer can originate from zzso of positive regulators, such as zzso or from zzso of negative regulators, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso are the focus of much cancer research because they are capable of controlling cell cycle zzso Holy zzso for cancer zzso zzso can be zzso by several zzso zzso by association with zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by disassociation from their zzso regulatory unit, zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso by adding zzso zzso Here we discuss what is known about each mechanism with a hope that these insights will become useful in developing strategies to eliminate cancer in the zzso
