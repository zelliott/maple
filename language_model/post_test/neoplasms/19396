It has been known for decades that zzso plays an important role in the activity of most zzso This zzso can result from direct damage to DNA through a chemical being DNA zzso or from indirect effects, such as through the production of oxygen zzso that then react with zzso This article presents a set of key events zzso DNA zzso zzso the process of zzso that leads to the subsequent zzso induction and enhanced cell proliferation that ultimately results in tumor zzso This set of key events for zzso chemicals was applied to two case studies zzso B1 and zzso with the aim of assessing the utility of the Human zzso zzso zzso for this class of zzso The conclusions were that the zzso was a viable approach for the use of zzso data for zzso chemicals obtained from both laboratory animals and human cells in zzso and in zzso for predicting human zzso In the case of zzso zzso the zzso could be used to predict that zzso in humans was a likely zzso In contrast, the zzso predicted that the human zzso potential of zzso was at best less likely than in zzso this conclusion was supported by the available zzso zzso
