The introduction of molecular targeted agents zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and cancer vaccines has raised the question whether alternate clinical trial designs, including window trials, are better suited to evaluate such new molecular entities zzso and improve their approval zzso In window trials, patients receive an zzso for a window of time before starting standard treatment allowing the evaluation of an zzso in tumors zzso by previous zzso 

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify window trials in adult and pediatric zzso 

zzso window trials were identified and zzso 13 in pediatric and 16 in adult zzso Most of the trials zzso tested zzso known to have activity in other clinical zzso In contrast to trials with zzso patients, the window trials established the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso patients with zzso or zzso lung zzso In window trials with ineffective or modestly active zzso we found no indication of a significant negative effect on overall survival for participating zzso 

zzso close safety monitoring and careful patient selection, window trials are a safe option to investigate potential clinical activity of zzso
