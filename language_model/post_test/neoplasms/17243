Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso use the zzso junction protein zzso 2 zzso as a zzso for zzso During Ad infection, the fiber and zzso base zzso proteins are produced in vast excess and form zzso called zzso It has been shown for zzso that zzso zzso into zzso zzso Our previous studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in insect zzso showed that zzso bind to zzso and trigger zzso signaling resulting in the transient opening of junctions between zzso zzso So far, a definitive proof for a function of zzso zzso in the viral life cycle is zzso Based on the recently published zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso we generated a zzso base zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is identical to its zzso counterpart zzso in the efficiency of progeny virus zzso however, it is disabled in the production of zzso For infection studies we used polarized zzso cancer cells or cell zzso We showed that in zzso infected cultures, zzso were released from cells before viral zzso and triggered the restructuring of zzso zzso This in turn facilitated lateral viral spread of de zzso produced zzso These events were nearly absent in zzso infected zzso Our in zzso findings were consolidated in mice carrying zzso tumors derived from human zzso cancer zzso Furthermore, we provide first evidence that zzso are also formed by another zzso Ad zzso the newly emerged, highly zzso zzso strain zzso The central finding of this study is that a zzso of zzso has evolved to generate zzso as a strategy to achieve penetration into and dissemination in zzso zzso Our findings are relevant for basic and applied zzso specifically for cancer zzso
