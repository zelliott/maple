zzso plays a pivotal role in tumor growth, tissue invasion and zzso zzso is an zzso inhibitor and has been shown to reduce tumor growth in animal zzso However, therapy with zzso zzso protein was hampered by its short zzso and zzso yield of zzso zzso We performed a phase I zzso clinical trial using zzso injection of an zzso containing human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso virus particles zzso in 15 patients with advanced solid zzso We observed zzso injections of zzso without zzso zzso Most frequently reported zzso adverse events were transient fever and local zzso Distribution studies revealed that the zzso was detected in the blood, throat and injection site, but rarely in the urine and zzso An increased zzso expression was detected using zzso zzso in serum in 13 of 14 treated patients throughout the period of treatment despite the presence of zzso zzso zzso Median serum basic zzso growth factor levels decreased from zzso zzso zzso at baseline to zzso zzso zzso after 28 days of first zzso Thus, direct zzso injection of up to zzso zzso of zzso to patients is well tolerated and further studies are necessary to define and increase clinical zzso
