The three members of the organic zzso zzso novel zzso are known to be involved in interactions with zzso zzso These proteins are characterized by 12 zzso segments connected by nine short zzso and two large zzso zzso It has been recently pointed out that zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso Its transport could be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso maintains the zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso distribution to zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified only in zzso mediates also zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with several zzso such as inflammatory zzso disease, primary zzso zzso diabetes, neurological disorders, and cancer, thus representing useful pharmacological zzso The function and interaction with drugs of zzso have been studied in intact cell systems and in zzso The latter experimental model enables reduced interference from other zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso the molecular bases of toxicity of some drugs have recently been zzso zzso zzso represent a promising experimental tool suitable for large-scale molecular screening of interactions of zzso with chemicals regarding human zzso
