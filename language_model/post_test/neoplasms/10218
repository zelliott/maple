zzso peptides have great potential as zzso agents zzso to their ease of rational design and target zzso However, their utility in zzso is limited by low stability and poor tumor zzso 

The authors review the development of zzso zzso with potential for cancer zzso zzso that arrest the cell cycle by mimicking zzso zzso or induce zzso directly are zzso 

The authors searched zzso for articles concerning the development of therapeutic peptides and their zzso 

zzso of cancer cell proliferation directly using peptides that arrest the cell cycle or induce zzso is a promising zzso zzso can be designed that interact very specifically with zzso and/or zzso zzso and with members of zzso zzso Use of these peptides is not limited by their design, as a rational approach to zzso design is much less challenging than the design of small zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso However, the limitations of zzso therapy lie in the poor zzso properties of these large, often charged zzso zzso overcoming the drug delivery hurdles could open the door for effective zzso therapy, thus making an entirely new class of molecules useful as zzso zzso
