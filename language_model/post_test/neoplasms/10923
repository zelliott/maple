Because of high spatial resolution and superior tissue zzso a zzso laser of the zzso spectrum has great potential to improve the efficacy of conventional zzso zzso however, the lack of suitable zzso has so far limited its bedside zzso Recently, our group reported that a brief zzso by zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso can zzso various cellular behaviors in zzso and in zzso Here, we demonstrate that targeted zzso by a zzso laser disrupted zzso blood vessels, and the zzso of vascular zzso growth factor signaling zzso the efficacy of zzso zzso Further, we show that zzso oxygen species zzso are generated in response to laser zzso and reducing the zzso levels of zzso rendered zzso cells resistant to zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that a zzso laser can be used as a zzso therapeutic zzso for cancer treatment, especially when used in combination with conventional zzso zzso
