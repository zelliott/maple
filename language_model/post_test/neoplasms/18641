The zzso zzso zzso exerts essential functions in the zzso of zzso and therefore constitutes an important drug zzso In order to generate efficient drugs against zzso a new approach includes zzso proteins zzso one molecular address to specifically target zzso and one bacterial or plant toxin that will eventually kill the zzso zzso Using this frame, several zzso toxins have been designed namely zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso and zzso As molecular address, all of these fusion proteins use the zzso zzso of zzso that binds with high affinity to zzso through its growth factor domain zzso The various toxin zzso were derived from either diphtheria zzso zzso zzso A zzso or zzso In this review, we describe the rational, design, production and therapeutic zzso potential of these zzso zzso
