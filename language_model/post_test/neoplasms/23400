No patient had a zzso deep vein zzso two (3 zzso patients had new pulmonary zzso one in each zzso zzso Major bleeding occurred in three patients (5 zzso Two patients on the zzso zzso filter arm (7 zzso had complications from the zzso Median zzso were 493 days in the zzso only arm and zzso days for zzso + zzso zzso filter zzso zzso zzso Complete resolution of zzso zzso occurred in 51 % of patients within 8 weeks of initiating zzso 

No advantage was found for placement of a zzso zzso filter in addition to zzso with zzso sodium in terms of safety, zzso zzso zzso pulmonary zzso or survival in this prospective zzso trial evaluating zzso plus a zzso zzso filter in cancer zzso zzso complete resolution rates of zzso were observed on both study zzso
