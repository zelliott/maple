Class zzso zzso zzso zzso generate the secondary zzso zzso which plays an important role in many cellular zzso The zzso of zzso in cell zzso is routinely measured using zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of membrane zzso synthesis and turnover as detected by zzso zzso have not been validated using an independent zzso In the present study, we measured zzso zzso growth zzso membrane zzso production using a specific zzso zzso zzso and compared the results with those obtained using zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly accumulated at the leading edge of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso at 1 zzso and returned to zzso levels by 5 zzso In contrast, membrane zzso production, measured by the membrane zzso of an zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso remained zzso zzso above zzso level throughout 4-5 zzso of zzso zzso To determine the reason for this disparity, we measured the rate of zzso zzso by measuring the zzso of the zzso signal after zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso membrane zzso within 10 s of treatment, suggesting that zzso turnover occurs within seconds of zzso In contrast, zzso membrane zzso once initiated by zzso was relatively insensitive to zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso zzso may affect the apparent zzso of zzso zzso and zzso consistent with this hypothesis, we found that zzso zzso zzso for zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso like zzso are specific for zzso inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10) zzso of zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso are a useful tool to detect localized zzso and illustrate the importance of using multiple approaches for the zzso of membrane zzso
