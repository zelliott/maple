Studies aimed at zzso mechanisms responsible for the expression of drug resistance, which in the past have zzso largely on the use of experimental animal model zzso systems, have more recently employed human zzso zzso The advantages and limitations of the two main approaches adopted for in zzso studies, which have involved either direct use of biopsy specimens or work with human zzso established as continuous cell lines, are reviewed zzso zzso is made to the need for strict characterization of the zzso cell populations under investigation, and their potential instability and zzso particularly in terms of drug responses, are zzso Studies using human zzso cell lines have been more extensive than those employing biopsy material zzso Examples of investigations zzso drug resistance using lines derived from zzso and from zzso of the zzso zzso or colon are zzso The question of whether these human zzso model systems accurately reflect the types of resistance encountered clinically is zzso Finally, several potential areas for further study are proposed centering on current investigations that address the issues of whether different mechanisms of resistance might be involved depending not only on the order of resistance expressed but also on the way in which such resistance was developed or zzso
