zzso is a double zzso protein that binds zzso to zzso zzso It belongs to the BET zzso and zzso family that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso in other zzso zzso is essential for cellular growth and has been implicated in cell cycle control, DNA zzso and gene zzso found in zzso zzso Recently, zzso has been found in several zzso complexes, including the general zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor, and is capable of stimulating zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso is used as a cellular zzso by some animal and human zzso zzso for zzso viral zzso to zzso zzso This zzso zzso by zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso viral zzso segregation during zzso Interestingly, zzso is also identified in a zzso zzso complex assembled by zzso zzso and turns out to be the long sought cellular zzso that zzso the expression of zzso E6 and zzso zzso that antagonize zzso and zzso tumor zzso activity, zzso The dual role of zzso in gene zzso and repression illustrates how a dynamic zzso zzso is able to recruit distinct zzso regulators to zzso promoter activity through cell cycle zzso
