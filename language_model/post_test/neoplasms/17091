zzso zzso 1 zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso is frequently zzso and associated with a poor prognosis of cancer patients, thus providing a promising target in zzso zzso zzso of the current project was to evaluate the effect of the novel zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in combination with zzso 

In zzso proliferation and radiation cell survival zzso as well as in zzso local zzso control zzso after single treatment and combined radiation and drug application were carried out using the zzso cell zzso models zzso and zzso In addition, cell cycle zzso were monitored in zzso and in zzso 

zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso effect and an increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso alone reduced zzso cell survival, while zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso under clamped zzso was not zzso In contrast, local zzso control was significantly improved after application of zzso zzso simultaneously to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso alone and zzso zzso after combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 56 zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Despite the lack of direct cellular zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso during zzso zzso significantly improves local zzso control when compared to zzso zzso This result is likely explained by a considerable effect on cell cycle and an independent zzso potential of zzso zzso
