zzso killer cells zzso are zzso zzso with the unique capacity of killing zzso fresh human tumor cells in short-term zzso zzso appear to kill zzso tumors as well as zzso self and zzso tumors with complete zzso both at the population and zzso zzso zzso studies on the zzso of zzso conclude that zzso are distinct from the classical zzso and zzso systems based on a number of criteria including surface zzso zzso conditions, and spectrum of susceptible target zzso zzso kill zzso zzso in a manner similar to fresh zzso As yet, the target cell zzso responsible for zzso to zzso zzso is unknown, but zzso proteins are definitely zzso zzso of zzso requires only zzso and is most efficient using zzso zzso Because zzso alone is sufficient for zzso zzso we have tested in zzso whether fresh zzso could be activated in the presence of zzso as might be desired in zzso zzso zzso was greatly suppressed by tumor zzso zzso zzso is also suppressed by zzso but not zzso zzso Because of the above and other findings, we have initiated a clinical protocol to test whether zzso made from zzso patients' zzso could eliminate residual zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso plus zzso to maintain zzso ability, are injected during zzso zzso studies in a rat zzso model have shown this approach to be zzso Eleven zzso patients have been injected zzso with zzso and/or zzso with no immediate or long-term zzso months zzso adverse zzso Much work is needed to understand the zzso phenomenon and to resolve its potential usefulness in cancer therapy as well as its inherent zzso zzso
