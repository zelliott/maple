The zzso of both chemotherapy and zzso is to a large extent directly related to their ability to induce DNA zzso The ability of cancer cells to zzso and repair this damage contributes to therapeutic zzso zzso DNA repair in normal tissue may impair normal tissue zzso zzso differences in DNA repair pathways may also influence the natural history and progression of cancer and hence zzso The base zzso repair zzso zzso has evolved to repair base damage induced by zzso and zzso base targeting zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression and zzso in protein expression within zzso may alter DNA repair capacity and influence both cancer progression and clinical responses to chemotherapy and zzso We discuss the role of zzso genes as potential zzso and zzso markers in human cancer and review the current state of play within this zzso
