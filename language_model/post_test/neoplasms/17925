Implementation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the clinical laboratory requires validation against established zzso zzso tools in common use include exchange of consecutive sections with another institution that has already established the FISH zzso comparison with conventional banded zzso zzso confirmation of specificity using zzso normal zzso consecutive zzso sections of a validation set tested by a reference laboratory, and specificity assessment against well characterized cell zzso We have investigated the feasibility of using tissue zzso zzso constructed from zzso zzso as a preliminary zzso tool for validation of zzso FISH zzso Cell lines currently in use for FISH controls are used to generate zzso in zzso mice which are fixed in zzso and zzso zzso A zzso is constructed using duplicate donor zzso from the zzso zzso zzso used represent a wide range of zzso used routinely for zzso fixed zzso embedded sections evaluated by zzso zzso cocktails zzso for several zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and soft tissue zzso have been used in this zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso steps are automated using a zzso zzso zzso Discovery zzso zzso and stringency washes are performed manually zzso zzso zzso are tracked using a zzso image scanner and analyzed using zzso specifically developed for each molecular zzso FISH results for each zzso in the zzso zzso exactly to the zzso previously established for the parent cell line from which the zzso was zzso zzso complexity tissue zzso constructed from zzso zzso are excellent validation tools for initial assessment of zzso FISH probe zzso
