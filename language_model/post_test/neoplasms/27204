zzso zzso zzso is zzso in numerous human zzso and plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso and zzso In the present study, we identified a specific zzso inhibitor using zzso zzso screening of large and diverse chemical zzso This zzso inhibitor selectively suppresses zzso zzso zzso activity, but not activity of other zzso zzso It also zzso the effects observed upon genetic zzso zzso such as suppressing survival and zzso zzso and triggering zzso cellular zzso zzso we discovered a critical function of zzso in positively regulating cancer stem cell populations and zzso ability through genetic and pharmacological zzso zzso zzso inhibitor exhibits potent zzso activities in multiple animal models and zzso with zzso agents to reduce cancer cell zzso Our study thus provides pharmacological evidence that zzso is a promising target for restricting cancer stem cell and cancer zzso
