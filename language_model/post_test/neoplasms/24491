zzso tumor targeting and zzso imaging into an integrated platform is limited by lack of strategies to enable systemic yet zzso delivery and imaging of specific zzso Many zzso viruses serve for zzso delivery but require elimination of native zzso for zzso zzso in contrast, zzso viruses can be adapted to bind to zzso receptors but are otherwise poor zzso Here we introduce a system containing zzso from zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso Our zzso zzso zzso targets an zzso We show that zzso provides superior tumor zzso over zzso and that incorporation of zzso terminal repeats is associated with improved fate of the delivered zzso Moreover, we show that the zzso dynamics and spatial zzso of gene expression zzso by targeted zzso can be monitored by zzso zzso zzso This new class of targeted hybrid viral particles will enable a wide range of applications in biology and zzso
