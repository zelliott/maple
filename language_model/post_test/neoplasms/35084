A single zzso zzso gene locus zzso codes for a family of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso which we first identified in human zzso The locus also codes for zzso which are abundant in several other normal zzso zzso and body zzso including milk, and in zzso of zzso zzso These zzso zzso seem to be very zzso in zzso and, in a search for zzso specific or zzso zzso a large number of related zzso have been isolated which bind to the zzso zzso Many of the zzso show a pronounced zzso specificity on zzso and are being used widely in cancer diagnosis in zzso and in zzso and even in cancer zzso To investigate the expression of these zzso in normal and zzso cells complementary DNA coding for the zzso zzso has been zzso Here we present evidence obtained using this zzso that the zzso locus is a zzso zzso region of human DNA similar to those described by several groups, but which is novel in that it is transcribed and zzso and that the same zzso is zzso in the expressed gene zzso
