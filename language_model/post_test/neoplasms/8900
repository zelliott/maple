Since the discovery of zzso about 40 years ago, the design of innovative zzso zzso drugs is a growing area of zzso Transition metal coordination complexes offer potential advantages over the more common zzso drugs, including a wide range of coordination number and zzso accessible zzso states, zzso of the thermodynamics and zzso of zzso zzso as well as a wide structural zzso zzso substances interact with cell molecular targets, affecting zzso functions resulting in cancer cell zzso zzso are another way to use metals as zzso zzso The metal nucleus of the unstable zzso becomes stable by emitting zzso The biological effect in different zzso is obtained by the zzso of this energy from the radiation zzso by the zzso the principal target generally agreed for zzso zzso being zzso A new area of clinical research is now emerging using the same experimental metal zzso but in a radically different zzso metals and metal zzso used as zzso zzso zzso In this field, man-made zzso zzso of high electron density and zzso size and shape offer the possibility of entering cancer cells and zzso high amounts of energy in the tumor only when exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso such as zzso oxide engineered as 50 zzso zzso zzso with a negative surface zzso zzso have been developed as selective zzso which represents a breakthrough approach for the local treatment of solid zzso The properties of zzso zzso their chemistry, size, shape and surface charge, have been designed for efficient tumor cell zzso zzso brings a physical mode of action, that of zzso within the cancer cells zzso zzso characteristics of zzso have demonstrated a very promising zzso ratio for human zzso across a broad zzso zzso zzso has entered clinical development in therapy of advanced soft tissue zzso and head and neck zzso
