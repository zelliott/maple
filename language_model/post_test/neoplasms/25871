The depth distribution of the zzso zzso flux is a major factor in zzso zzso capture therapy zzso in determining the efficiency of cell zzso In this paper the zzso detector method is developed and applied to measure the zzso zzso zzso flux depth zzso zzso of the zzso detector include small size, direct measurement of zzso zzso flux in a mixed radiation field of zzso zzso zzso and the possibility of zzso zzso The zzso were performed at zzso a zzso zzso The experimental results were compared with the zzso zzso flux calculated by the zzso Carlo method and found to be in good zzso
