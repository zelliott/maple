zzso dependence is a zzso zzso that occurs in many human tumor cell lines but not normal in zzso cell zzso zzso tumor cell lines are unable to zzso and arrest in the late zzso phase of the cell cycle when zzso is replaced by its immediate precursor homocysteine in the culture medium zzso zzso However, it is not known whether zzso dependence occurs in fresh patient tumors as it does in cell zzso In order to determine whether zzso dependence occurs in fresh patient tumors as well as whether zzso dependence occurs in fresh patient tumors as well as in cell lines we took advantage of the technique of zzso zzso to grow tumors directly from zzso We then measured nuclear DNA content by image analysis to determine the cell cycle position in zzso compared to zzso medium in 21 human patient zzso Human tumor cell lines found to be zzso dependent by cell count were used as positive controls and were found to have marked reduction of cells in zzso compared to total cells in the cell cycle in zzso medium with respect to the zzso total cell ratio in zzso zzso Therefore late cell cycle arrest was used as a marker of zzso dependence for zzso patient zzso We found that 5 human tumors of 21, including tumors of the zzso breast, zzso zzso and a melanoma, were zzso dependent based on cell cycle zzso These data on fresh human tumors indicate that zzso dependence may frequently occur in the cancer patient zzso zzso for potential therapy based on zzso dependence are zzso
