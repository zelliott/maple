The zzso induced killers zzso treatment is an emerging adoptive zzso with greater zzso activity than zzso killers zzso Our previous study suggested that zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso might contribute to the zzso therapy in zzso In this experiment, we studied the mechanisms that might be zzso 

Fresh zzso zzso were zzso and proportions of zzso and zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso synthesis were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity were examined by the zzso zzso zzso method and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso polarization in zzso zzso was identified, characterized with the enhanced frequency of zzso zzso and a dramatic increase of the levels of zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso in the culture zzso The zzso in synthesis of zzso zzso could be maintained without any zzso zzso supplement, as implied by the results from quantitative zzso Although no tumor zzso occurred, an early stage of zzso was detected in zzso zzso with zzso zzso after 4 hours of zzso This zzso activity of zzso zzso elevated along with the incubation time and depended on the cell contact through the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a subset that might favor the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso by producing an advantageous zzso zzso and inducing tumor zzso though the zzso zzso
