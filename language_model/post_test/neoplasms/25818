The accuracy of zzso Carlo codes in dose calculation systems relies on the correctness of the input zzso zzso Carlo calculations are performed to generate zzso descriptions of the zzso zzso accelerator at 6 and 18 zzso Before these data can be reliably used as the input for dose calculations in patients, they must be properly zzso This validation consists of three different zzso validation of the coding of the zzso validation of the user code for the zzso Carlo code, and validation of calculated zzso Geometric validation is performed by zzso and testing treatment head components zzso The user code is checked by testing for energy conservation and the zzso reduction schemes incorporated into the user code are checked by comparison of results calculated with and without their zzso zzso of the zzso description is performed by calculation of depth dose zzso and lateral profiles for dose deposition in zzso with difference plots used to illustrate any zzso zzso and experimental zzso output is also zzso After complete zzso the calculated data can then be reliably used as the input for dose zzso
