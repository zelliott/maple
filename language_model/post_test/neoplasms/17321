In parallel group trials, long-term efficacy zzso may be affected if some patients switch or cross over to the alternative treatment arm prior to the zzso In zzso trials, switch to the experimental treatment can occur in the control arm following disease progression and potentially impact overall zzso It may be a clinically relevant question to estimate the efficacy that would have been observed if no patients had zzso for example, to estimate zzso clinical effectiveness for a health technology zzso Several commonly used statistical methods are available that try to adjust zzso data to account for treatment zzso ranging from zzso exclusion and zzso approaches to more complex inverse probability of zzso weighting and zzso structural failure time zzso These are zzso along with their key zzso strengths, and zzso Best practice guidance is provided for both trial design and analysis when switching is zzso Available statistical software is zzso and examples are provided of the application of these methods in health technology assessments of zzso zzso Key considerations include having a clearly articulated rationale and research question and a zzso trial with sufficient good quality data collection to enable robust statistical zzso No analysis method is universally suitable in all situations, and each makes strong zzso zzso There is a need for further research into new or improved zzso This information should aid zzso and their colleagues to improve the design and analysis of clinical trials where treatment switch is zzso
