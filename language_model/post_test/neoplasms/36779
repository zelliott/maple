Nearly zzso years after the initial discovery of zzso we are now in an ideal position to exploit our vast knowledge of zzso biology in the creation of novel cancer zzso zzso of zzso function through zzso or other means, occurs very frequently in human zzso Loss of zzso function has been linked with zzso prognosis in a large number of zzso types, as indicated by more aggressive zzso early zzso and decreased survival zzso Many different avenues of research have zzso upon zzso to highlight this protein as being one of the zzso cellular zzso to stress, in particular to DNA zzso zzso advances have been made in understanding the complex role zzso plays in the regulation of zzso and cell cycle zzso This review is not meant to be a comprehensive description of zzso biology, but rather serves to highlight current progress in the development of zzso cancer zzso These may be zzso into three basic zzso gene replacement therapy using zzso zzso restoration of zzso function by other means and, finally, targeting of the zzso dysfunction zzso Rapid progress is expected to be made regarding the identification of conventional pharmaceutical agents which either work in a zzso manner or act zzso in zzso defective zzso Gene replacement therapy with zzso zzso also holds considerable potential for obtaining clinically relevant results zzso The other forms of cancer therapies based around zzso are much further behind in the zzso process, but may prove to more zzso in the long run, especially in terms of zzso As with many other fields, the innovation of successful zzso cancer therapies is only limited by our understanding of zzso biology and the creative use of such zzso
