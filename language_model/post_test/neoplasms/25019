zzso class zzso measure provides an effective evaluation of the zzso power of a feature zzso and is widely used in feature zzso However, this measure is zzso intensive or even prohibitive when it is applied to gene expression zzso In this study, a zzso approach to zzso measure evaluation is proposed, with the goal of reducing zzso zzso Instead of evaluating zzso measure directly in zzso space, the zzso approach evaluates the measure through successive evaluations in zzso zzso Because of its zzso nature, this approach is extremely efficient when it is combined with a forward search zzso In addition, it is noted that gene zzso selected by zzso measure tend to zzso training data and zzso zzso on unseen test data, due to small sample size in gene expression zzso To alleviate the zzso problem, a zzso zzso zzso measure is proposed in this study, and guidelines on determination of zzso parameters are zzso Experimental studies on five gene expression problems show that the zzso zzso zzso measure substantially zzso the zzso zzso measures and the benchmark zzso feature elimination zzso zzso in all five zzso
