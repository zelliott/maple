In zzso zzso the responsible inherited cancer genes are defective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This inherited zzso is present in all cells of the zzso and only leads to cancer if in a zzso cell a complete set of specific cancer zzso is zzso Since one defective zzso has been zzso only three additional zzso cancer zzso are required, according to our previously published view zzso Res zzso The number of de zzso arising zzso cells in such a person is thus multiplied by a factor equal to the reverse of the zzso frequency, that is about zzso This can be observed zzso in zzso zzso occur in zzso cells zzso zzso cancer zzso also depend on cell zzso If an inherited cancer zzso zzso to cancer formation in certain zzso then the cancer risk in these zzso is enhanced by zzso zzso zzso in these zzso will appear simultaneously if the number of cells and the growth zzso are zzso This is of course observed in paired zzso like the zzso and the female zzso In cancer family syndromes different zzso may be affected at the same zzso Examples are type I and type II cancer family syndrome and multiple zzso zzso type 1 zzso and zzso The zzso diagnosed zzso are not caused by zzso zzso zzso in two zzso will arise at difference times if the number of end cells per organ and the growth zzso zzso In this case the second zzso is called a second primary zzso and is not caused by zzso zzso A good example are the second primary zzso in zzso zzso The inherited defective zzso is a zzso zzso This defective inherited gene causes a zzso fold increase of the normal zzso zzso This means that nearly always one or more zzso will zzso zzso this pattern of inheritance has led to the erroneous conclusion that the genetic zzso is dominant at the level of the zzso The zzso times enhanced zzso zzso in zzso cancer is helpful for the clinical recognition of zzso zzso That is, zzso cancer can be recognized not only by family history, but also by early zzso the zzso and bilateral zzso its occurrence as cancer family syndrome or by second primary zzso It is thus recommended to screen patients and families with zzso cancer for first and second primary zzso Treatment of patients with zzso zzso requires extra care to avoid additional cancer zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
