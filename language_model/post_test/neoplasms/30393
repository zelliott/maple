Many zzso from normal individuals as well as patients with various disease states contain zzso zzso which show specificity for zzso zzso of zzso revealed by zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso containing such zzso activity as well as zzso negative for these zzso contain low molecular weight zzso components of slow zzso which inhibit these zzso zzso Low molecular weight zzso show both zzso and zzso and are zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso A common situation is thereby revealed in which human zzso zzso showing specificity for zzso zzso are present in serum along with low molecular weight zzso components capable of zzso zzso or zzso of such zzso factors is a phenomenon shared by both normal human zzso and zzso from patients with various disease zzso
