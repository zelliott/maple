zzso or zzso zzso cells are composed of zzso and inflammatory cells as well as of zzso cells such as zzso and zzso In addition to participating to the tumor tissue frame, these cells contribute actively to tumor nutrition and progression through zzso and production of a variety of molecules including numerous zzso of which a number zzso zzso zzso and zzso are almost exclusively produced by zzso zzso zzso Cancer cells interact with zzso zzso cells which involves a large number of zzso Several molecules zzso zzso zzso produced by cancer cells induce the production of zzso zzso which in turn stimulate cancer cells through binding to a zzso (for example, zzso and zzso alpha v beta zzso Our experience shows that zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells zzso D, zzso zzso leads to an adverse clinical course in breast zzso zzso and zzso differences were found between zzso zzso cells and zzso of normal tissue and our research team found that zzso zzso cells also respond differently to similar zzso in different zzso These results support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso of cancer is not only dependent on zzso characteristics but also on those of zzso cells and that comparable zzso in two individuals may follow different clinical zzso These studies and our experience underscores the importance of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells because of the therapeutic potential of this zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells should be genetically more stable that cancer cells and, in theory, should less likely develop zzso and treatment zzso
