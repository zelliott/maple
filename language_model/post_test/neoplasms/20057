zzso a widely used chemical, is considered a human zzso 

We extended follow-up of the largest industrial cohort of workers in zzso industries zzso zzso zzso by 10 years through zzso zzso mortality ratios zzso and rate ratios zzso were calculated for deaths from solid tumors using quantitative zzso exposure zzso 

During zzso zzso zzso deaths zzso With one additional death, previously observed excesses for zzso cancer zzso zzso 10) persisted for peak, average intensity and cumulative exposure; zzso in the highest exposure categories were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For all cancer, solid tumors and lung cancer, zzso among exposed workers were zzso but internal analyses revealed no positive associations with zzso zzso 

zzso with previous analyses of this zzso this update continues to suggest a link between zzso exposure and zzso zzso
