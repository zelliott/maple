zzso phase of acute zzso disease zzso is mainly zzso by zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso is ascribed to the zzso zzso We reasoned that development of zzso zzso might be triggered by recruitment in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso donor T zzso zzso we evaluated the correlation existing between circulating zzso zzso zzso early after zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso and occurrence of zzso 

Surface expression of zzso zzso on T cells was evaluated by means of direct zzso in zzso zzso zzso patients given zzso were zzso 13 of them experienced zzso zzso 14 developed zzso without zzso involvement, and 38 did not develop zzso Patients were studied early after initial signs of zzso zzso and before occurrence of zzso 

We found a significantly higher absolute number of zzso and a significantly lower percentage of zzso T cells in patients with zzso zzso than in patients with zzso without zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso or not experiencing zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso In particular, we found that zzso zzso occurred in over zzso of patients showing an absolute number of zzso T cells zzso or zzso 60 zzso zzso and a percentage of circulating zzso T cells zzso zzso 

zzso the absolute number of zzso T cells and percentage of zzso T cells at time of zzso zzso may help identify patients at risk of developing zzso zzso who could benefit from strategies aimed at zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso
