This paper presents an analysis of trends and patterns in cancer mortality and examines four possible explanations for its recent zzso changes in data zzso cohort zzso competing mortality from other causes of zzso and improvements in health zzso 

All contribute to some extent to the observed changes, with each affecting predominantly different age zzso There is evidence of a significant zzso of cancer deaths among the elderly especially in rural areas and of significant changes in coding practices in the early zzso Competing mortality from cardiovascular diseases and accidents can explain some reduction in male deaths from cancer in middle zzso Birth cohort effects can explain some reduction among males after early middle age and among females at all zzso The impact of changes in health care are more difficult to identify with certainty but there is evidence of reduced deaths from childhood zzso 

Recent changes in mortality in Russia are complex and their understanding will require a multidisciplinary approach embracing zzso epidemiology and health services zzso
