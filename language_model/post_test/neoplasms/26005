The suitability of a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso therapy of tumors was zzso zzso was zzso in small zzso zzso zzso prepared by zzso on a zzso zzso These samples were studied by zzso time resolved zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this zzso environment zzso was still an efficient zzso oxygen producer, as indicated by the characteristic zzso oxygen zzso at zzso zzso in zzso when excited with a 28 zzso laser pulse at 412 zzso Moreover, unlike with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the reduced zzso rates of zzso zzso with the increasing time of zzso by a zzso zzso This was shown in an indirect way, based upon the appearance of a second component of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso in zzso and by direct zzso zzso state monitoring, detecting zzso zzso at 440 zzso in zzso The zzso of higher zzso states was delayed upon zzso This reflects an irreversible interaction of zzso oxygen with membrane zzso thus demonstrating the potential of the zzso form of zzso to efficiently disintegrate tumor cell zzso and to be a suitable preparation for the zzso zzso
