zzso protein zzso binds with high affinity to zzso zzso a major component of the zzso zzso zzso but at zzso pH the binding is inhibited by calcium zzso zzso Because zzso zzso in the blood in zzso zzso form, the occurrence of zzso interactions in zzso has been zzso To define the basis of zzso of zzso interaction by zzso at pH zzso we hypothesized that zzso site on zzso consisted of zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acids zzso zzso drastically decreased the binding of zzso to zzso indicating that the zzso zzso site indeed formed the zzso zzso To determine the requirements for possible interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso we investigated zzso of zzso interaction by zzso as a function of zzso zzso did not inhibit binding of zzso to zzso at pH zzso and zzso The contrasting zzso binding properties of zzso at zzso and mildly zzso pH indicated that the interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso was controlled by zzso We conclude that the zzso of binding of zzso to zzso by zzso at pH zzso is a mechanism to prevent zzso interactions under normal zzso zzso in its zzso zzso state, is capable of binding zzso but only at the inflammatory sites and tumors with low zzso zzso zzso and the zzso all have been implicated in zzso Taken together our data raise the possibility that zzso interactions may change the architecture of zzso to modify the development of zzso
