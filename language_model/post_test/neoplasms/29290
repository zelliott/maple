As zzso technologies zzso increasing number of zzso proteins specific for cancer cells are being zzso These proteins are of great interest, particularly because they are rich in targets for zzso zzso them candidate zzso for early tumor diagnosis, prognosis and treatment have been zzso The suitability of several zzso proteins as targets for drugs or zzso has already been tested in zzso and clinical zzso The results were encouraging in some cases, but not in zzso They demonstrate that each type of tumor has its specific zzso zzso and that suitable targets of cancer diagnosis and therapy must be found for each kind of zzso This implies that zzso proteins for each type of tumor cell need to be zzso This review describes the current technologies of membrane protein characterization in a first part and subsequently summarizes the membrane associated proteins currently being tested as targets for diagnosis and treatment in breast, zzso zzso and colon zzso Their function will be explained and their role in tumor biology will be zzso
