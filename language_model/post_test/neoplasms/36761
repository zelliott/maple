The diagnostic and zzso value of bone zzso biopsy zzso has been widely investigated in patients with chronic zzso disorders zzso The present study is based on a review of the results of routine zzso taken from 93 essential zzso zzso patients at the time of zzso 

The common zzso zzso parameters and zzso variables were considered for diagnostic and zzso zzso zzso correlations were looked for zzso Moreover, the diagnostic significance of the zzso findings was tested by means of cluster zzso zzso survival and zzso survival were considered as zzso zzso 

There were no correlations between the clinic and zzso findings, and none of the zzso and clinical parameters was zzso of survival or the occurrence of major clinical zzso zzso analysis of the zzso findings revealed two distinct zzso zzso one was clearly zzso the other had somewhat zzso zzso The zzso and overall survival rates in the latter group were significantly worse zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso respectively), with major zzso events accounting for most of the difference in zzso zzso 

These results have no zzso counterpart in the literature, but we feel that zzso zzso findings could be included in the definition of zzso zzso scores in order to allow therapeutic strategies to be adapted to the level of zzso
