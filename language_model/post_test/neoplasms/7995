zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso zzso currently under clinical development as an zzso zzso In zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso is strongly bound to the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso Here, we examined the role of protein binding as a zzso of the zzso behavior of zzso in zzso 

zzso data were obtained from a group of 41 patients with cancer receiving zzso as a 72-hour zzso infusion zzso zzso to 53 zzso 

Over the tested dose range, total drug clearance was distinctly zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso from zzso zzso (at zzso zzso to zzso zzso (at 54 zzso As individual values for zzso increased, values for clearance decreased in a linear fashion zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso although the relationship was shallow, and the data showed considerable zzso Interestingly, no zzso in the zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso or fraction at the peak plasma concentration of zzso was apparent zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest the zzso zzso that extensive binding to zzso may explain, in part, the unique zzso profile of zzso described previously with a small volume of distribution and slow systemic zzso and zzso that measurement of total zzso zzso in plasma is a poor surrogate for that of the zzso active fraction zzso zzso
