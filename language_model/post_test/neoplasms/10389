In the majority of zzso cells, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins are involved in many zzso functions including regulation of zzso zzso control of cell shape, zzso zzso and zzso of signal zzso zzso In a previous study, we used a dominant negative zzso to address zzso involvement in zzso of zzso zzso and subsequently we depicted zzso key role in melanoma cell migration and zzso zzso we highlight recent advances on zzso involvement in the zzso phenomenon, including also some more neglected zzso zzso Novel molecular processes driven by zzso zzso include: zzso acquisition of resistance to zzso and triggering of programmed cell death zzso Recent data support an integrated role of zzso also in development of tumor zzso On one hand, zzso may be responsible of zzso execution of specific known functions such as zzso and zzso and on the other, it may also participate to unique zzso zzso through the establishment of zzso linkages with zzso zzso For instance, zzso zzso absence or zzso activity has started to be correlated with tumor progression in many tumors of different species, including zzso zzso zzso may act simultaneously as a regulatory or zzso zzso in both normal and tumor zzso It is still to be established whether this zzso feature of zzso is due to some unknown transforming zzso property or to the fact that a zzso zzso zzso links to zzso thus distracting it from its normal zzso However, the contribution of zzso functional deregulation to the acquisition of the zzso zzso appears clear and zzso or zzso zzso associations may represent good candidates for future zzso zzso
