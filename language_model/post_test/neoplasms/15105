zzso such as zzso zzso in zzso are zzso to zzso zzso zzso of END and zzso Because zzso zzso have chemical structural similarity to the natural estrogen, they are thought to behave like selective zzso zzso zzso and therefore have zzso effect against zzso zzso We isolated a series of zzso compounds, named as zzso from the seed of Chinese herb zzso zzso 

We zzso several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects were analyzed in cancer cells and in tumor zzso zzso In zzso metabolism of zzso was determined in zzso 

Contrasts to the classic zzso zzso were not zzso to END and zzso A mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso compound zzso zzso have zzso effect on breast, zzso and zzso cancer cells and zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso This induction of zzso seems to be zzso by zzso of zzso because zzso of zzso activity significantly reduced induced zzso We showed a broad zzso activity of zzso on seven tumor zzso models including breast, zzso liver, and cervical zzso zzso with in zzso data, zzso treatment induced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in tumor zzso 

zzso is a class of nature zzso compounds, whose action and zzso effect is zzso by the mechanisms different from the classic zzso zzso zzso effect and zzso activity is exerted through zzso process, which is zzso by a decreased zzso ratio and zzso of zzso
