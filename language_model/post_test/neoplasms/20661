This article presents and analyses a general method of correcting for the presence of zzso zzso from a parent zzso in tissue during PET zzso The method is based on a zzso approach, zzso parent scan together with an independent supplementary scan in which the zzso zzso of interest itself is zzso The method zzso for the presence of zzso derived zzso zzso delivered to the zzso of interest through the zzso 

Data from the supplementary scan are analyzed to obtain the tissue impulse response function for the zzso The time course of the zzso zzso in plasma in the parent scan is zzso with its tissue impulse response function to derive a correction zzso This is not a simple zzso technique but 1 that takes account of the different zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the 2 zzso 

The method, its zzso and its limitations are discussed with respect to zzso and its principal zzso zzso 

The general method, based on a zzso approach, can be used to correct for zzso zzso in zzso of interest during PET zzso The correction accounts for zzso zzso that are derived zzso and delivered to the zzso of interest through the zzso
