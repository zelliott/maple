Analysis of gene expression on a zzso or large-scale is an increasingly recognized method for functional and clinical investigations based on the now extensive catalog of known or partially zzso zzso The accessibility of this approach can be enhanced by using readily available technology zzso on zzso radioactive zzso and the zzso resource to assemble sets of zzso We have set up such a zzso flexible system and validated it by the study of quantitative expression levels for 120 genes in six cell lines, including three zzso zzso cell zzso A number of important parameters are identified as necessary for the assembly of a valid set and the zzso of zzso quantitative zzso The extensive data assembled in this survey identified potential targets of zzso for example the zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso We also demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure for relatively small tumor samples, without recourse to probe amplification zzso
