The signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso function as downstream zzso of zzso and growth factor zzso zzso Compared with normal cells and zzso zzso activated zzso have been detected in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines and primary zzso zzso are activated by zzso zzso which is normally a transient and tightly regulated zzso In tumor cells, zzso zzso of zzso is linked to persistent activity of zzso zzso including zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and many zzso Such zzso zzso zzso are often activated as a consequence of permanent zzso engagement in zzso or zzso zzso and growth factor signaling or represent autonomous zzso active zzso as a result of genetic zzso found in tumor but not normal zzso zzso signaling of specific zzso in particular zzso and zzso has been demonstrated to directly contribute to zzso by stimulating cell proliferation and preventing zzso zzso participate in zzso through zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle regulators such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso active zzso signaling pathways has been shown repeatedly to inhibit tumor cell growth in zzso and in zzso and provides a novel means for therapeutic intervention in human zzso In this review, we will: zzso explain the mechanisms of zzso zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso recent evidence for the critical role of zzso activated zzso and zzso in zzso zzso identify candidate zzso target genes implicated in tumor zzso and zzso discuss molecular and pharmacological strategies to interfere with zzso signaling for potential therapeutic intervention in human zzso
