The discovery in the early zzso that magnetic zzso zzso zzso to zzso or viral zzso can, in the presence of an external magnetic field, greatly enhance gene transfer into cells has raised much zzso This technique, called zzso was initially developed mainly to improve gene transfer in cell cultures, a simpler and more easily zzso scenario than in zzso zzso These studies provided evidence for some unique capabilities of zzso zzso the interest in zzso expanded to its application in animal models and led to the association of this technique with another technology, magnetic drug targeting zzso This combination offers the possibility to develop more efficient and less invasive gene therapy strategies for a number of major zzso like cancer, zzso and zzso zzso The goal of zzso is to concentrate zzso zzso with therapeutic drugs, in target areas of the body by means of properly focused external magnetic zzso The availability of stable, nontoxic zzso zzso complexes now offers the opportunity to develop magnetic gene targeting zzso a zzso of zzso in which the gene coding for a therapeutic zzso rather than the zzso itself, is delivered to a therapeutic target area in the zzso This article will first outline the principle of zzso subsequently describing the properties of the magnetic fields and zzso used in this zzso Next, it will review the results achieved by zzso in cell zzso zzso the potential of zzso for implementing minimally invasive gene therapy will be zzso
