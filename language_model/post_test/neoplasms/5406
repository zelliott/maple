To zzso the eventual extra loss of life incurred to cancer patients in zzso compared with those in Sweden that was possibly attributable to differences in zzso 

zzso based survival of cancer patients in zzso was compared with that of zzso immigrants to Sweden and that of all cancer patients in zzso The cancer sites studied were female breast and zzso male lung and zzso and male and female stomach and zzso 

Data on incident cases of cancer were obtained from the population based Swedish and zzso cancer zzso 

Data from zzso patients in Sweden, zzso patients in Estonia, and patients from the total Swedish population were included in the zzso 

zzso in survival among the three zzso controlling for follow-up time and age at diagnosis, were observed in breast, zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso The survival rates of zzso living in Sweden and the total population of Sweden were better than that of the zzso living in zzso For zzso of the breast and zzso the excess mortality in the older age group (75 and above) was much greater in zzso than in the other zzso 

Most differences in cancer survival between zzso and Swedish populations studied could be attributed to a longer delay in diagnosis, and also to inferior treatment (including access to zzso in zzso compared with zzso zzso lag in socioeconomic development, particularly in its public health zzso and zzso is probably the main source of the differences zzso
