zzso global assessment zzso is a simple and reliable zzso zzso The zzso has not been evaluated in India or in populations where chronic energy zzso zzso is zzso We evaluated the value of zzso nutrition, determined using the zzso in predicting zzso adverse outcomes in cancer zzso 

Two hundred and zzso cancer patients undergoing zzso surgery were screened for zzso using a modified version of the zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso years zzso zzso 165 zzso were zzso All patients were followed up till zzso and number of days on zzso length of zzso stay, occurrence of major adverse events, and death within 30 days were zzso The association of zzso zzso scores zzso B, or zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and four outcome variables were tested for statistical zzso 

The cancer sites included head and neck region in zzso gastrointestinal tract in 53, zzso zzso in 28, and other sites in 73 zzso The zzso scores were A in 152, B in 98, and C in 16 zzso The zzso was zzso zzso in 110 zzso zzso The length of zzso stay and the number of zzso days revealed a significant trend from zzso to zzso zzso zzso adverse events occurred in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso groups A, B, and C, respectively zzso The risk for adverse events was significantly higher in zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Three patients in zzso group and one in zzso group died within 30 days zzso No significant association was detected between the three zzso groups and duration of zzso use, length of zzso stay, adverse events or zzso 

zzso is a simple and inexpensive way to identify clinically relevant zzso in Indian patients undergoing cancer zzso Low zzso was not associated with zzso adverse zzso and its use for nutritional screening is likely to overestimate severe zzso in Indian zzso
