The tumor zzso zzso preserves zzso integrity by inducing zzso of genes controlling growth arrest or zzso zzso zzso involves zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes incorporate either the zzso gene 1 zzso or zzso zzso as the zzso zzso The observation that tumor cell lines harboring zzso zzso specifically maintain expression of zzso and that zzso complexes with zzso prompted us to examine the role of zzso in regulation of zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso but not zzso led to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso We found a zzso region unique to zzso was required for binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as to zzso zzso expression of a zzso region deletion zzso zzso that is defective for zzso binding inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso in zzso In support of zzso zzso by the combined activities of zzso and zzso we show that DNA damage signals promoted disassociation of zzso from zzso thereby allowing zzso zzso Our data demonstrate a novel function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso with zzso to zzso zzso activity and permit cancer cell zzso
