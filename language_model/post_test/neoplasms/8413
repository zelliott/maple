The fundamental intrinsic zzso zzso zzso mechanism of human life is zzso The essential zzso model for chemical electromagnetic zzso zzso in human systems is zzso the underpinning of which is zzso resonance which is represented by zzso zzso zzso zzso This equation sets in dual resonance zzso potential and electromagnetic zzso Basic zzso interactions occurring in human systems produce gravity waves through elastic deformation of the zzso field, thus zzso a zzso wave which results in a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of particulate zzso An essential feature of this presentation is the demonstration of how the zzso interactions in the human system zzso the regulation of the atomic zzso lattice structures of critical molecules to metabolism and segments of the zzso zzso system described by zzso zzso Also maintained are zzso zzso in the midst of zzso and zzso DNA to zzso maintain the integrity of growth, development and zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate how fundamental zzso noise is a zzso manifestation with weak electric and magnetic fields being zzso by zzso and zzso interactions of the human being with the zzso field and flux zzso zzso outer zzso The finding is that the subtle forces of life and flux zzso on the order of magnitude zzso zzso are the critical factors in maintaining zzso zzso and repair when imbalance such as cancer zzso
