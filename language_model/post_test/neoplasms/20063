The zzso zzso is a potentially vulnerable property of cancer cells, yet zzso targeting attempts have been hampered by unacceptable zzso In this study, we have shown that it is possible to disrupt specific zzso filament populations by targeting zzso of zzso a core component of zzso zzso that are selectively zzso in zzso A novel class of zzso compounds has been developed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso of tumor cells, zzso both tumor cell zzso and zzso Our lead compound, zzso is effective in zzso and in zzso in reducing tumor cell growth in zzso and melanoma zzso zzso zzso shows no adverse impact on cardiac structure and function, which is the major side effect of current zzso zzso This zzso study shows that it is possible to target specific zzso filament populations fundamental to tumor cell viability based on their zzso zzso zzso This improvement in specificity provides a zzso to the development of a novel class of zzso compounds for the potential treatment of a wide variety of zzso
