Using the technique of zzso zzso zzso chain zzso we isolated a novel gene zzso that is zzso in zzso zzso tissue zzso as compared to normal brain tissue zzso zzso is also highly expressed in zzso zzso colon tumor zzso to brain, breast tumors, prostate tumors and a prostate tumor cell line zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso is highly expressed in several tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso chronic zzso leukemia and zzso zzso as compared to zzso Additionally, zzso is very highly expressed in cell lines derived from zzso grade IV zzso normal human fetal zzso zzso and zzso zzso is moderately expressed in zzso zzso and zzso tumor cell zzso zzso expression is localized to the frontal zzso zzso lobe and the zzso in the normal zzso zzso zzso such as zzso stomach, adrenal cortex, small zzso and zzso show high expression of zzso We also show that zzso is expressed zzso higher in fetal brain (20 weeks) than in adult zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso for zzso shows no zzso to known sequences in the data zzso
