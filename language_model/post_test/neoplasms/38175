To assess the utility of maintaining and analyzing a zzso database while investigating a zzso perceived increase in the zzso of zzso zzso and port dysfunction in a cohort of zzso zzso 

All 152 patients undergoing zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso of a malfunctioning zzso central zzso zzso zzso from January through June 2004 at a single cancer center in the United States were included in a zzso zzso Patients were zzso by time to device failure and the initial method of zzso placement zzso vs zzso zzso Data were analyzed after 3 months, and areas of possible improvement were identified and acted zzso Three months of follow-up data were then collected and similarly zzso 

In a zzso period, 152 patients treated for zzso malfunction received a total of 276 doses of zzso zzso A zzso interim analysis revealed a disproportionately high rate zzso of early zzso malfunction zzso zzso days from zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso positioning in zzso of these patients, all of whom had surgical zzso zzso There was a 50% absolute decrease in the number of patients presenting with zzso malfunction in the period from April through June zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in these patients demonstrated a 50% decrease in the zzso of zzso positioning zzso zzso zzso 

zzso positioning was likely responsible for some, but not all, cases of zzso Maintenance of a zzso database is a relatively simple intervention that can have a clear and important impact on the quality and cost of patient zzso
