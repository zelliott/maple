Ten patients with intractable pain (five cancer and five zzso were treated with continuous zzso zzso delivered by an implanted continuous infusion zzso Both patient groups were evaluated and compared using an identical battery of zzso examinations administered before and 12 weeks after zzso The zzso group reported significant reduction in pain on serial visual pain analogue scales at 12 weeks compared with no change in the zzso group reports despite a much lower baseline report in the cancer zzso Both groups of patients reduced their oral narcotic requirement significantly during continuous zzso zzso zzso While the cancer patients took more oral narcotic at zzso at 12 weeks no difference existed in oral intake between the two zzso Both groups required significant serial increases in infused zzso indicating that spinal zzso zzso tolerance zzso The results of this study confirm the sustained zzso efficacy reported earlier in zzso pain zzso thus supporting further cautious expansion of this therapy within the zzso pain zzso In contrast, a poor response was seen in the zzso group, consistent with the unsatisfactory responses to many potentially zzso approaches to chronic zzso zzso We are thus discouraged from further use of this therapy in the patient with chronic zzso zzso
