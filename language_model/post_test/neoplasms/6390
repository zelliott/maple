The protein coding sequence of most zzso genes zzso is interrupted by zzso parts zzso which are excised in a process termed zzso To generate a mature zzso zzso zzso hundreds of zzso zzso and zzso interactions are required to zzso out often very large zzso with high zzso and zzso Inherent to zzso is the use of alternative zzso sites generating immense zzso diversity from a limited number of zzso In humans, alternative zzso is a major mode of regulating gene zzso occurs in over zzso of genes and is particularly abundant in the zzso Only recently, it has been recognized that the complexity of the zzso process makes it susceptible to interference by various zzso These compounds include zzso zzso commonly used drugs and food supplements and cause a spectrum of effects ranging from deleterious zzso of general zzso to highly specific modifications of alternative zzso affecting only certain zzso zzso in zzso have been implicated in numerous diseases such as cancer and zzso zzso regulation plays an important role in the execution of programmed cell zzso The switch between zzso and zzso zzso by alternative zzso site selection and zzso of a number of zzso factors impacts on cell survival and zzso Here, our current knowledge is summarized on compounds interfering with general and alternative zzso and of the current methodology to study changes in these processes relevant to the field of zzso and future risk zzso
