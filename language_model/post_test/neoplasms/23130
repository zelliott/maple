zzso muscle area zzso zzso is currently calculated from zzso zzso thickness zzso zzso and zzso circumference zzso zzso In assessing the accuracy of the current equation by comparison to zzso measured by computerized zzso zzso error in each of the four approximations made was found to result in a 20 to zzso overestimate of zzso Two zzso error sources were: a 10 to zzso zzso caused by assuming a circular zzso muscle compartment and a 5 to zzso zzso due to inclusion of zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso equations for men and women were zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso - 10, and zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso With two additional study groups, the overall improved accuracy of the new equations was confirmed, although the average error for a given patient was 7 to zzso the relationship between corrected zzso and total body muscle mass was established zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso corrected zzso and the minimal range of corrected zzso values compatible with survival (9 to 11 zzso was zzso zzso estimates of zzso severity and prognosis can therefore be calculated from two simple zzso zzso and zzso
