Cancer initiation is classically associated with the induction of zzso on specific zzso or tumor zzso zzso due to the presence of zzso DNA zzso produced by zzso or zzso zzso zzso Among several DNA repair zzso the zzso zzso repair zzso is the most important and versatile one in removing the bulky zzso induced by physical and chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by a zzso in zzso and an over zzso increased risk of skin cancer, represents a paradigm to understand the role of zzso zzso in the development of zzso We reviewed here several zzso zzso used in zzso studies investigating the association between DNA repair efficiency and cancer zzso zzso DNA repair could contribute to the development of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso although zzso results have been zzso More consistent findings were observed between cellular sensitivity towards zzso agents and zzso zzso
