zzso findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso combination provides synergistic zzso activity on both zzso and zzso zzso 

We have designed a zzso zzso phase I trial with a fixed dose of zzso zzso zzso two times zzso plus IM zzso zzso per day; 300 and 400 zzso two times zzso zzso patients had zzso and zzso advanced gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso were monitored for the first 6 zzso zzso survival zzso and response assessment are based on zzso zzso zzso zzso of IM were measured before and after exposure to zzso 

No zzso toxicity was zzso Fourteen patients of the expanded cohort received 400 zzso two times daily of IM with zzso Apart from a case of possibly related acute zzso occurring after 4 years of treatment, we did not see unexpected zzso No zzso zzso interaction was zzso There was no objective zzso We have observed long-lasting stable disease in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso range, zzso and short-term stable disease in heavily zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso range, zzso 

This combination is feasible and may warrant further exploration in zzso zzso or zzso zzso
