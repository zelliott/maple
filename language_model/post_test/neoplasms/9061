zzso of zzso cells to induced zzso stem cells zzso shares much similarity to the cancer initiation process, and the molecular mechanisms underlying both processes remain to be zzso Here, we report that a zzso or embryonic stem zzso Ras gene zzso which encodes a zzso active form of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso signaling zzso are important zzso for the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso zzso enhanced mouse zzso induction while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling by genetic or chemical means greatly impacted the zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso active zzso gene could rescue the reduced efficiency resulting from zzso zzso and zzso analyses further revealed that zzso is tightly coupled with zzso signaling to enhance zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso can function as a barrier to the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso largely accounts for the enhancing effect of zzso signaling on zzso zzso these results unravel the significance of the zzso signaling axis in zzso generation, suggesting a possibly shared molecular basis for both zzso zzso and cancer zzso
