An expanding body of evidence supports a role for gut microbes in the zzso of zzso Previously, the focus was on identifying individual bacterial species that directly initiate or promote gastrointestinal zzso however, the capacity of gut microbes to influence systemic inflammation and other downstream pathways suggests that the gut microbial community may also affect risk of cancer in zzso outside of the gastrointestinal zzso zzso contributions of the gut zzso that may influence cancer zzso in the broad sense include zzso harvesting otherwise zzso nutrients and/or sources of energy from the diet zzso zzso of dietary fibers and resistant zzso zzso metabolism of zzso both potentially beneficial or zzso zzso dietary constituents, drugs, zzso zzso zzso renewal of gut zzso cells and maintenance of zzso zzso and zzso affecting immune system development and zzso zzso the complex and dynamic interplay between the gut zzso host immune system, and dietary zzso may help zzso mechanisms for zzso and guide future cancer prevention and treatment zzso
