There is increasing evidence that zzso play an important role in the process of tumor zzso zzso is a frequent finding in cancer patients zzso Although the mechanisms underlying zzso are not yet fully zzso zzso factors with zzso activity and growth factors, zzso zzso and factors zzso from bone zzso zzso cells, as well as growth factors released by zzso zzso via an zzso zzso are zzso to influence this zzso The progression of cancer is associated with zzso which results from direct influences of tumor cells and diverse indirect zzso zzso zzso serve as zzso surfaces amplifying the zzso zzso It is well known that zzso proteins are involved in different steps of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso adhering to zzso facilitate zzso of zzso cells (which exert various zzso zzso to zzso cells and their zzso to the zzso zzso It was also documented that zzso induce zzso in zzso zzso are a rich source of zzso zzso They also store and release zzso zzso In addition, zzso express surface growth factor zzso which may regulate the process of zzso zzso also contribute directly to the process of basement membrane and zzso zzso zzso by releasing zzso or indirectly via inducing zzso cells and tumor cells to release zzso zzso as well as through the zzso activities of zzso growth zzso The zzso activities of zzso in the process of new blood vessel formation during tumor development and zzso formation may create the possibility of introducing zzso agents for zzso therapy in cancer zzso Thus far experimental studies employing zzso of zzso zzso have yielded promising zzso
