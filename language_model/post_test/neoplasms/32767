An hypothesis of zzso is derived which suggests that zzso initially induce zzso of zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso Although the resulting cascade of changes in zzso activity would be zzso because of the large number of differentiated cells present in a zzso only stem cells are vulnerable to the zzso array of zzso expression by virtue of their zzso being more vulnerable to zzso zzso zzso it is derived that there are at least three major classes of zzso and the zzso that are zzso during zzso are particularly susceptible to zzso zzso
