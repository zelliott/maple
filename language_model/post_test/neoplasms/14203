The combination of zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso through zzso and zzso zzso This phase I study aimed to explore the safety and toxicity of this combination in pediatric patients with advanced solid zzso 

Patients zzso years of age with zzso solid tumors (including zzso were zzso zzso was administered daily by mouth or zzso zzso tube, with doses adjusted to achieve a target trough concentration of zzso zzso with weekly intravenous zzso zzso escalated 4-6 zzso according to 3 + 3 phase I zzso 

Fourteen patients were enrolled zzso age zzso years; range zzso of whom 12 were zzso for toxicity and 11 for zzso One patient experienced a zzso toxicity zzso 3 zzso at the highest zzso dose zzso zzso was the most common zzso zzso zzso trough zzso were significantly lower in patients receiving drug via zzso tube zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for oral zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in serum concentration of soluble vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso at 28 days compared to baseline consistent with zzso of zzso One patient had a partial response and three had stable disease for more than 3 zzso 

The combination of zzso inhibitor and zzso given over an extended continuous schedule is safe, associated with a reduction in circulating zzso factor zzso zzso and resulted in clinical zzso Future studies using the zzso administered zzso inhibitor zzso are zzso
