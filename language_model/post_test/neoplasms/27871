It is well established that zzso class I molecules present peptides from zzso zzso such as virus or zzso zzso to zzso T zzso This implies that expression of zzso class I molecules on zzso is also mandatory for an effective T cell response against zzso Indeed, numerous zzso models exist (such as zzso zzso zzso in which the existence of zzso presented zzso zzso and a protective zzso response have been well documented zzso in zzso et zzso zzso However, the key question of whether zzso T cell attack has a role in human cancer remains zzso Similarly, the role of zzso cells is zzso these seem to lyse cells with low levels of zzso class I expression more zzso So far, human zzso specific zzso that can be presented by zzso molecules have not been identified on the molecular zzso For a zzso of patients with zzso melanoma, the existence of zzso zzso can be deduced from the existence of zzso specific zzso T cells isolated from zzso However, for other zzso more important zzso such as zzso of the zzso breast and zzso even indirect evidence is still zzso It is thus unknown how many zzso express zzso specific zzso at all and whether these putative zzso are of unique specificity or are shared by certain groups of zzso zzso zzso Most reports agree that zzso cells in general have a more or less pronounced propensity to express class I molecules zzso and often in the sense of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso expression are zzso zzso studies revealed that an abnormal content in surface class zzso zzso may be associated with other aspects of zzso of the zzso and hence may eventually correlate with biological signs of an increased grade of zzso zzso of defective zzso class I expression for the survival of a zzso clone may theoretically consist of an escape from zzso T cell attack or in an increased zzso for zzso zzso zzso In view of the fact that a particular zzso in a cell will be presented only by one or few zzso zzso on the cell, one would not expect that zzso would lead to a loss of all zzso zzso It can be deduced from the few existing clinical studies on the zzso impact of zzso zzso class I expression that zzso by one way or the other is not a relevant mechanism in terms of zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
