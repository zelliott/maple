In Brazil, where the use of zzso grows zzso studies that evaluate the impact of zzso exposure on cancer zzso and mortality are very zzso In this study, we evaluated the degree of correlation between zzso sales in 1985 in zzso Brazilian states and cancer mortality rates during zzso Information of all cancer deaths occurred in men zzso years old from 1996 to 1998 were collected from National zzso zzso Single and multiple linear zzso zzso were obtained to assess the relationship between per capita sales of pesticides in 1985, zzso cancer mortality rates zzso soft zzso zzso zzso lip, zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso stomach, brain, zzso lymphoma, and multiple zzso during zzso and several zzso In addition, states were zzso into three groups according to zzso of pesticides sales and cancer mortality rate ratios zzso were then calculated using first zzso as zzso Finally, a factor analysis was performed to reveal zzso relationships between zzso use and cancer zzso Pesticide sales showed statistically significant correlation with the mortality rates for the zzso of prostate zzso zzso soft tissue zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso lip zzso zzso esophagus zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to weak correlations were observed for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, stomach, brain, and NHL and multiple zzso In addition, correlation between zzso sales and zzso cancer mortality rates was reinforced by multiple zzso zzso For all zzso cancer mortality rates were significantly higher in the states of moderate zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso sales, with zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso hidden relationships between zzso sales and cancer mortality in Brazil, through a factor analysis, revealed that zzso public policies and lifestyle behaviors may explain almost zzso of the zzso of the studied zzso The results suggest that population exposure to pesticides in the 1980s in some Brazilian States may have been associated with selected cancer sites observed a decade zzso
