Grade IV chemotherapy toxicity is defined as absolute zzso count zzso The zzso is considered as the lowest zzso number following chemotherapy, and generally is not expected before the 7th day from the start of zzso The usual zzso dose of zzso zzso is 300 zzso starting zzso h after chemotherapy until zzso zzso However, individual patient response is largely zzso so that zzso doses can be zzso The aim of this study was to verify if peripheral blood automated flow zzso and flow zzso analysis may be helpful in predicting the individual response and saving zzso 

During Grade IV zzso blood counts from 30 cancer patients were analyzed daily by zzso 120 automated flow zzso zzso and by zzso flow zzso till the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso index zzso zzso and various cell zzso in the peripheral blood were zzso At zzso zzso was started and 81 chemotherapy cycles were zzso zzso were zzso according to their number and to two zzso of zzso needed to recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed in relation to mean values of zzso and mean absolute number of zzso in the zzso zzso The linear zzso of zzso % over time in relation to two zzso of zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and blasts were also zzso 

In the zzso phase, the increase of zzso above the upper limit of zzso zzso median zzso characterized a slow zzso zzso zzso levels were directly related to the cycle number and zzso related to the absolute number of zzso and zzso zzso A faster zzso recovery was associated with a higher zzso increase per day zzso zzso zzso higher blast zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our study showed that some biological indicators such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells may be of clinical relevance in predicting individual zzso response to zzso Special attention should be paid when zzso zzso exceeds the upper limit of zzso because the zzso recovery may be zzso
