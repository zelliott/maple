zzso virus zzso establishes zzso infection and is associated with tumors, such as zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso and gastric zzso We recently reported that zzso gastric cancer shows an zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso infection zzso extensive DNA zzso with gene repression within 18 zzso On the basis of the absence of both zzso and zzso zzso in the surrounding zzso of zzso gastric cancer, it is suggested that an zzso cell acquires extensive zzso to silence multiple tumor zzso genes in a short time period and zzso into cancer cells, not forming a zzso field with zzso infection or zzso zzso The zzso mechanism induced by zzso infection has not been fully zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso that are dependent on a different zzso status or other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso may affect host zzso zzso Expressions of viral proteins and small zzso are also different depending on zzso status, and some viral proteins might trigger DNA zzso by inducing DNA zzso zzso In this review, we discuss these roles of zzso infection in driving zzso and their possible association with zzso DNA zzso
