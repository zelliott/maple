The discovery of small molecules targeted to specific zzso pathways has revolutionized zzso zzso However, such therapy often fails due to the evolution of acquired zzso One long-standing question in clinical cancer research is the identification of optimum therapeutic administration strategies so that the risk of resistance is zzso In this paper, we investigate optimal drug dosing schedules to zzso or at least zzso the emergence of zzso We design and analyze a zzso mathematical model describing the evolutionary dynamics of a tumor cell population during zzso We consider drug resistance emerging due to a single zzso zzso and calculate the probability of resistance arising during specific dosing zzso We then zzso treatment protocols such that the risk of resistance is minimal while considering drug toxicity and side effects as zzso Our methodology can be used to identify optimum drug administration schedules to avoid resistance zzso by one zzso zzso for any cancer and treatment zzso
