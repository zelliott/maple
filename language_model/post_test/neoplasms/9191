The zzso zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in embryonic development, tissue zzso and tumor progression zzso of its effect on cell zzso migration, and zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso of zzso signaling that act by binding directly to zzso zzso or to zzso zzso In recent years, zzso expression of zzso has been reported to be associated with numerous zzso As gene expression of zzso members is often lost through promoter zzso zzso of zzso through the use of zzso zzso agents could renew the expression of zzso members and further antagonize deleterious zzso zzso Several reports have described zzso zzso of these zzso signaling zzso in various human zzso suggesting their possible role as tumor zzso zzso family members thus come across as potential tools in combating zzso zzso However, little is known about zzso family members and their role in different zzso This review zzso covers all the available information on the role of zzso molecules in various human zzso
