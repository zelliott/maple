We have actively carried out zzso and concentrated zzso zzso therapy zzso for zzso zzso However, with conventional zzso the membrane becomes clogged after processing about zzso of zzso zzso fluid due to the fact that it is rich in cellular and zzso zzso it is therefore difficult to process the entire volume of collected zzso 

We developed zzso which includes a membrane cleaning function, and applied it in 73 cases of zzso zzso after its basic functions had been evaluated in 11 cases of zzso zzso zzso 

On average, using zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso and concentrated to zzso zzso in zzso zzso the membrane was cleaned an average of three times zzso zzso and this enabled the processing of more zzso in a shorter zzso In addition, the circuit and the handling were both markedly simple, and fever, which has been the most notable adverse effect with the conventional system, was not an zzso 

Since zzso was safe and is expected to improve the zzso symptoms and general condition of the patient, it is proposed that this novel system should actively be used not only for zzso but also as supplementary treatment for zzso zzso
