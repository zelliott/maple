Treatment of cancer with chemotherapy is becoming increasingly more effective but is associated with short and long-term side zzso zzso side effects remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to prevent zzso 

To evaluate the effectiveness of oral (and zzso zzso agents for oral zzso and oral zzso in patients with cancer zzso head and neck zzso compared with zzso or no zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane zzso Health Group Specialist Register search up to July zzso zzso lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors of eligible studies were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional zzso 

Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: design - random or zzso allocation of zzso participants - anyone with cancer receiving chemotherapy zzso head and neck zzso interventions - zzso agents prescribed to reduce oral conditions arising from cancer or its zzso outcomes - zzso and oral zzso 

Information regarding methods, participants, interventions and outcome measures and results were independently zzso in zzso by two zzso zzso & zzso Specialist advice was sought to zzso zzso Authors were contacted for details of zzso and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried out using the zzso criteria zzso zzso The Cochrane zzso Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and relative risk values calculated using random effects models where significant zzso was detected zzso zzso zzso 

zzso reports of trials were initially zzso Two were duplicate reports and nine were excluded as there was no zzso zzso Of the 27 zzso studies 14 had data for zzso zzso 945 zzso patients and 15 included data for oral zzso with zzso zzso zzso Of the eight zzso agents used for zzso only one, ice chips, was effective zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), p zzso zzso The zzso to prevent one extra case of zzso over the baseline zzso using ice chips was 4 zzso 3 to zzso The zzso for when the baseline zzso of zzso in the population ranges from 50% to zzso are 5 to 4 zzso There is evidence that zzso agents which are partially or fully absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract prevent oral zzso and that the partially absorbed agents may be more effective than the fully absorbed zzso The zzso for partially absorbed agents was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The zzso to prevent one extra case of oral zzso over the baseline zzso using partially absorbed drugs was 3 zzso zzso 3 to zzso The zzso for when the baseline zzso of oral zzso in the population ranges from zzso to zzso are 4 to 2 zzso The general reporting of zzso was poor however the median zzso score was acceptable and improved further when the authors provided additional zzso The sensitivity analysis confirmed the findings for oral zzso 

There is some evidence that ice chips prevent zzso None of the other zzso agents included in this review prevented zzso There is evidence that zzso use of zzso agents which are absorbed or partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract reduce the clinical signs of oral zzso and the partially absorbed drugs may be more zzso Future trials in this area should address the link between oral and general health including outcomes relevant to the zzso zzso between medical and dental teams is zzso
