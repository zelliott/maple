A hypothesis is presented that zzso agents can alter gene expression at very high zzso even in zzso by altering DNA zzso levels and/or zzso Such changes can be zzso either in a stable or unstable manner, and can lead to the generation of more, or less, zzso zzso depending upon the zzso is zzso zzso An experimental model is reviewed to support this hypothesis in which it is shown that zzso zzso activity in zzso deficient tumor cell zzso can be switched on when exposed to the zzso drug and potent zzso agent, zzso in zzso The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the possible promoting effects of zzso therapies on the development of tumor cell zzso tumor progression and tumor cell zzso
