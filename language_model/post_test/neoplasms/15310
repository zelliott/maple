zzso stimulation or zzso administration zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in humans, zzso respectively, in zzso degradation to zzso and in zzso zzso To determine if similar effects result from zzso 2 zzso administration, plasma zzso and urinary zzso and zzso were measured in patients undergoing a phase 1 toxicity trial of zzso zzso given by daily zzso or continuous zzso administration for 7 days at doses of 1 zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases in plasma zzso levels and corresponding increases in urinary zzso and zzso were zzso These zzso effects of zzso are probably zzso by induction of zzso production, although elevated levels of zzso were not found in the zzso of these zzso In view of the indispensable role of zzso in synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso we suggest that some of the toxic side effects may be the result of this loss of zzso Since these zzso changes were detected at relatively low doses of zzso these zzso provide a highly sensitive means for monitoring in zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso
