zzso status has been zzso and incompletely recorded in health and vital registration data collections for the most zzso areas of Australia, including zzso where zzso of Australian zzso people zzso This paper reports an assessment of zzso status recording in zzso cancer registrations and estimates zzso mortality and survival from cancer in zzso zzso people using multiple zzso of missing zzso status in zzso Central Cancer zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and multiple zzso were used to assign zzso status to those records of cancer diagnosed from 1999 to 2008 with missing zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso registered in this zzso Estimates of zzso mortality and survival from cancer in zzso zzso people were compared with the zzso total population, as zzso zzso and mortality ratios, and with the zzso zzso 

Following zzso 146 zzso extra zzso in zzso males and 140 zzso in zzso females were found for zzso Mean annual cancer zzso in zzso zzso people was estimated to be zzso per 100,000 and zzso per zzso zzso and zzso higher than all zzso males and females zzso Mean annual cancer mortality in zzso zzso people was estimated to be zzso per 100,000 in males and 240 per 100,000 in zzso zzso and zzso higher than for all zzso males and females zzso Despite similar zzso of zzso cancer, mortality from zzso cancer in zzso people is significantly higher than in zzso people, as is mortality from zzso with zzso distant and unknown degree of spread at zzso Cancer survival in zzso people is significantly zzso 51% of males and zzso of females had died of the cancer by 5 years following diagnosis, compared to zzso and zzso of zzso males and females zzso 

The present study is the first to produce valid and reliable estimates of cancer zzso survival and mortality in Australian zzso people from zzso Despite somewhat higher cancer zzso in zzso than in zzso people, substantially higher mortality and lower survival in zzso people is only partly explained by more advanced cancer at zzso
