The zzso zzso zzso zzso component zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the final step in the de zzso zzso zzso zzso that produces zzso As a potential target for zzso intervention, we designed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), the corresponding zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso as mimics of the zzso intermediate in the zzso zzso All compounds are competitive zzso against zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso with the simple zzso 1 exhibiting the most potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Crystal structures of zzso zzso in complex with zzso 2 and zzso 3 revealed zzso binding modes similar to that of the zzso feedback zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the simpler zzso 1 had a completely different zzso binding mode and was relocated to the zzso binding pocket that was identified from previous zzso zzso zzso The aromatic zzso ring interacts with a zzso zzso similar to the interaction with the zzso zzso of zzso The crystal structures not only revealed the mechanism of zzso of these compounds, but they now serve as a platform for future inhibitor zzso zzso the zzso structure supports the notion that zzso lacking a zzso charged zzso can still inhibit zzso activity with comparable potency to zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor 3 also binds to the zzso zzso domain of zzso which now provides a lead compound for the design of zzso that simultaneously target both active sites of this zzso zzso
