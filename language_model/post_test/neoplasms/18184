To review the clinical presentation and management of zzso side effects of some of the new targeted zzso zzso 

Advances in molecular biology have led to the development of zzso agents that specifically target crucial molecules on zzso cells, or their surrounding cellular milieu zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso treatments for several solid tumors, including zzso zzso zzso cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and zzso cell zzso have recently been implemented as a result of these zzso Although these agents are generally much better tolerated than their zzso zzso new groups of side effects have emerged, especially with regard to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and - in particular - zzso growth factor zzso are associated with zzso reactions that may not only be dose limiting, but may significantly affect quality of zzso The spectrum of these reactions ranges from disfiguring zzso facial zzso to impaired wound healing, to disabling zzso zzso which can seriously impair zzso 

The recognition, prevention and management of the zzso side effects of these targeted agents can allow successful continuation of zzso therapy, and minimize patient zzso
