Although cancer types differ zzso many zzso share common gene expression zzso zzso with this zzso we find zzso and representative zzso and correlation zzso that are distinct in cancer and zzso zzso These differences originate in many zzso but comparatively few genes account for the major zzso We identify genes with different zzso regulation in cancer and zzso as indicated by significant differences in their correlation zzso Among the identified genes are many established zzso and zzso genes (such as members of the zzso the zzso and the Ras zzso and new candidate zzso Our findings expand and complement the zzso role of up and down regulation of these genes by emphasizing zzso changes in their zzso and correlation patterns at zzso level that are independent from their mean levels of expression in cancer zzso Given the central role of these genes in defining the zzso state it may be worth investigating them and the differences in their zzso regulation for developing zzso zzso zzso
