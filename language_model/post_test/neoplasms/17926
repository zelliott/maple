zzso zzso tools exist for simultaneously visualizing zzso and zzso of tumors, but are frequently hampered by a delicate balance between removing sufficient amount of the protein blocking full access of the probe to zzso to target zzso acids while still preserving sufficient target zzso for zzso The result is often zzso with either insufficiently zzso gene deletions and zzso due to masking zzso or zzso of the protein zzso Our purpose was to design and validate a gated zzso zzso that enables optimal and zzso detection of both gene and zzso Using the zzso zzso cell compartment within zzso organized in a tissue zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso signal amplification zzso with deposition of a zzso could be used during zzso permitting sufficient protein zzso while insuring probe accessibility to zzso acid zzso The method was successfully validated using a zzso containing 38 zzso cases previously zzso for zzso zzso zzso positive zzso cells were zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso for analysis of zzso amplification of the zzso organized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso successfully zzso zzso cell populations for gated zzso
