A number of publications have attributed a tumor zzso zzso function to zzso a gene associated with zzso familial early onset Parkinson's disease zzso zzso of zzso deletions and point zzso in tumors, functional studies, and data from mouse models have been presented to support the zzso We have asked whether zzso zzso are associated with history of cancer in zzso We interviewed 431 participants who were screened for zzso zzso including 149 zzso cases and their family members, who were unaware of zzso zzso We found no significant difference in zzso history of cancer among carriers of one or two zzso zzso and zzso odds ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso In particular, no increase in cancer history was seen among zzso and compound zzso zzso carriers compared to zzso zzso we zzso that published studies zzso zzso capability to zzso merit further exploration and we present a zzso of these data with respect to patterns of zzso zzso in normal and cancer zzso We conclude that although zzso may exert a zzso effect in mice, further studies are required prior to assigning a zzso function to zzso in zzso
