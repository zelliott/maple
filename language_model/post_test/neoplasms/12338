zzso analysis of CT and conventional zzso in zzso imaging is well zzso zzso of this study was to find out which patients or diagnostic groups may benefit the most from the newly introduced integrated zzso zzso 

407 zzso admitted zzso patients with accompanying CT zzso zzso and zzso patients without CT zzso zzso were examined by conventional ring zzso Two nuclear medicine physicians and two zzso assessed each patient's PET and CT scans for pathological zzso with regard to zzso and zzso of adjacent anatomical zzso Patients without pathological PET findings were assigned to groups A (with zzso or E (without zzso If the zzso and/or extent of a pathological PET focus could only be assessed by taking into account the CT zzso the patient was assigned to group C (with zzso or G (without zzso If PET alone was sufficient for both questions the patient was assigned to groups B (with zzso or F (without zzso If neither method allowed for a precise zzso zzso the patient was assigned to group zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of all patients were zzso PET alone zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso reading of PET and CT was needed for zzso zzso of patients referred to PET with a current zzso zzso reading of CT and PET did not suffice for zzso zzso of patients in that zzso A total of zzso zzso of the cases without CT would have profited from zzso The most frequent zzso diagnoses in group D zzso and conventional CT not zzso were zzso zzso with abdominal zzso while in group G (without CT but CT zzso zzso cancer with zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso reading of PET and already existing conventional CT failed to yield conclusive data with regard to zzso zzso in only zzso of patients so that zzso might have been helpful in these zzso zzso of the patients without current CT would have profited from an initial zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of all patients zzso PET or PET alone zzso did not require a CT for zzso zzso
