An important feature of cancer development and progression is the change in DNA zzso patterns, characterized by the zzso of specific genes zzso with an overall decrease in the level of zzso zzso of the zzso can affect both zzso zzso repeat DNA sequences and zzso zzso and is highly variable among and within cancer zzso Here, we review our current understanding of zzso zzso in cancer, with a particular focus on zzso of the different classes and families of repeat zzso The emerging data provide insights into the importance of zzso of different repeat families in the maintenance of zzso structural integrity and the zzso of normal zzso zzso We also consider the events underlying zzso zzso and the potential for the clinical use of characteristic DNA zzso changes in diagnosis, prognosis or zzso of zzso
