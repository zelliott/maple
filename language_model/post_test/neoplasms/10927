zzso analysis of body zzso is currently used for detecting zzso The objective of this study was to determine if the zzso virus carrying an enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso could detect rare cancer cells in body zzso against millions of normal zzso Human cancer cells suspended with normal zzso cells were infected with zzso at a zzso of infection zzso of zzso and zzso for 18 zzso Fluorescent zzso and flow zzso were used for zzso detection of cancer zzso zzso cells were confirmed as cancer cells with specific markers by zzso zzso Limits of detection of cancer cells in body fluid were measured by serial zzso zzso of technique was confirmed with samples from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso in 111 human cancer cell lines detected by fluorescent zzso at an zzso of zzso zzso selectively infected cancer cells and spared normal cells as confirmed by zzso zzso of detecting fluorescent green cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso at a ratio of 1 cancer cell to 1 million normal zzso zzso cells were detected by fluorescent zzso in patients' zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data show proof of the concept that zzso zzso expression allows detection of a single cancer cell against a background of 1 million normal zzso This method was demonstrated to be a reliable screening tool for human cancer cells in a suspension of normal zzso cells as well as clinical specimens of zzso zzso zzso
