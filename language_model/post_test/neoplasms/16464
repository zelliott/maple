The mouse zzso locus on zzso 8 was used as the zzso target for the study of spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso in kidney zzso and ear zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were exposed to zzso zzso of zzso radiation on their right sides, and zzso clones were isolated from zzso zzso zzso at times ranging from 1 day to 14 months after zzso A statistically significant increase in the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso was observed when compared with the spontaneous zzso zzso for the zzso zzso A molecular analysis of spontaneous zzso observed for the zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso apparent zzso loss was common in kidney zzso but zzso in the ear zzso whereas apparent deletions were common in the ear zzso but not detected in the kidney zzso For the zzso zzso apparent deletions were observed commonly demonstrating that these events are markers for zzso radiation zzso in this zzso All of the loss of zzso zzso tracts observed in the spontaneous zzso were zzso but zzso zzso patterns were observed in zzso of zzso zzso ear and kidney cell zzso Work with zzso cell lines showed that zzso zzso is a novel signature for delayed zzso radiation zzso zzso together, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso in zzso can result from both direct and delayed zzso zzso
