The objectives of this study were to determine threshold probabilities needed to perform zzso zzso zzso aspiration zzso and those needed to treat patients suspected of having zzso and then to compare these thresholds to the zzso and zzso probabilities of zzso associated with benign, zzso suspicious, and zzso zzso The goal was to aid zzso in making appropriate clinical decisions based on both quantitative and qualitative zzso 

The study included zzso consecutive zzso A decision tree was constructed to estimate the zzso zzso Using treatment threshold and likelihood ratios, the authors determined the zzso and zzso zzso zzso probability was compared with zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso probability of zzso for each diagnostic category with the treatment zzso zzso were zzso by zzso site, zzso size, and zzso 

zzso has a wide range of zzso probabilities within which it could be performed zzso The zzso probabilities for zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso after a positive or a negative result, respectively, were significantly different from the treatment threshold but not those of suspicious, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso probability of zzso diagnosis, zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different from that of zzso zzso zzso did not vary by zzso size, organ site, or zzso 

The authors demonstrated the uncertainty associated with zzso diagnostic categories and used the threshold approach to qualify zzso the decision to perform zzso and the decision to treat patients suspected of having zzso
