The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates cell zzso and tissue zzso Although zzso may be expressed zzso in many zzso during development and wound healing, its zzso expression appears to be associated with several pathological conditions, including zzso zzso expression has been demonstrated in most solid tumors and several zzso zzso including multiple myeloma and acute zzso many tumor zzso zzso is present not only in tumor cells but also in a number of zzso cells including zzso zzso cells and zzso The expression of zzso has been shown to be fairly high in tumor compared to normal, zzso zzso which has led to zzso being proposed as a therapeutic target, as well as a targeting agent, for the treatment of zzso The majority of therapeutic approaches that have been investigated to date have focused on zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction but these have not led to the development of a viable zzso targeted clinical zzso zzso zzso approaches zzso zzso zzso focused on decreasing zzso expression have demonstrated robust zzso activity in zzso studies but have been hampered by the obstacles of stability and drug delivery that have limited the field of zzso zzso acid based zzso More recently, novel approaches that target interactions of zzso that are downstream of zzso binding zzso with zzso or that exploit observations describing the biology of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and signaling have generated novel zzso targeted candidates that are now advancing towards clinic zzso This review will discuss some of the pitfalls that have delayed progress on zzso interventions and will zzso recent progress in the development of zzso zzso
