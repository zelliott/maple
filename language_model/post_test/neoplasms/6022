To advance knowledge about the zzso potential of individual zzso we investigated the effects of B vitamin and/or zzso fatty acid supplements on cancer outcomes among survivors of cardiovascular zzso 

This was an ancillary study of the zzso With zzso zzso zzso and zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary prevention trial zzso In all, zzso individuals aged 45 to 80 years were zzso in a zzso zzso design to one of the following 4 daily supplementation groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso B vitamins and zzso fatty zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso hazard ratios zzso and zzso zzso regarding the cancer outcomes were estimated with Cox zzso hazards zzso 

After 5 years of zzso incident cancer was validated in zzso of the sample (145 events in men and 29 in zzso and death from cancer occurred in zzso of the zzso There was no association between cancer outcomes and supplementation with B vitamins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a statistically significant interaction of treatment by sex, with no effect of treatment on cancer risk among men and increased cancer risk among women for zzso fatty acid supplementation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We found no beneficial effects of supplementation with relatively low doses of B vitamins and/or zzso fatty acids on cancer outcomes in individuals with prior cardiovascular zzso Trial zzso zzso zzso zzso
