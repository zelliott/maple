We examined plasma zzso levels of tissue factor zzso in 95 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate the role of zzso in zzso A significant zzso of plasma zzso levels of zzso was observed in cases of zzso associated with zzso However, no such significant zzso was observed in cases of zzso associated with acute zzso leukemia zzso acute leukemia except zzso zzso crisis of chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso No significant zzso of zzso was observed in patients without zzso except 4 cases of cancer who developed zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels of zzso were higher in both cases of zzso with zzso failure and chronic zzso failure without zzso than its levels in those without zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso levels of zzso in zzso patients with zzso failure were considered to be carefully zzso The levels of zzso were decreased with the clinical improvement in some cases of zzso but were further increased or remained at high levels in patients who showed no improvement of zzso Thus, plasma zzso levels of zzso is an important marker to predict the development and/or prognosis of zzso especially in patients with zzso
