Every living zzso is exposed to numerous zzso insults on a daily basis as a consequence of cellular metabolism and exposure to environmental agents capable of interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso pollutants, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Maintenance of the integrity of the zzso is paramount to the survival and propagation of a species and involves the continuous activity of a variety of DNA repair zzso zzso zzso in genes involved in DNA damage recognition and repair lead to disease by zzso of the zzso and increased zzso In fact, it is common for cancer cells to exhibit loss of zzso stability presumably as a result of zzso acquired zzso in DNA repair genes zzso Currently, roughly 150 DNA repair genes have been identified in humans zzso and a variety of familial cancer predisposition and/or premature aging syndromes are now linked to various zzso zzso in these genes zzso zzso interaction between DNA repair pathways and global cell differentiation pathways is supported by zzso similarities between zzso zzso in a DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso Though there is clearly some degree of functional zzso between DNA repair pathways for correction of specific DNA zzso the particular clinical characteristics of a repair zzso can be predicted by the specific repair zzso affected zzso Patients with cancer predisposition syndromes often have multiple family members affected by cancer, develop cancer at an early age, and are at risk for developing multiple primary tumors over time zzso zzso Though patients with identifiable cancer predisposition syndromes are rare, defining their molecular defects has led to widespread zzso by uncovering relevant molecular pathways that are zzso via zzso zzso zzso in the majority of sporadic zzso In this review, we describe general molecular mechanisms of major forms of DNA repair and illustrate clinical consequences of deficiencies in these zzso For more in depth detail, the reader is referred to several recent reviews and texts zzso zzso
