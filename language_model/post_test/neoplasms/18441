The differential zzso of fluorescent molecules in zzso versus normal cells is a zzso phenomenon and is the basis for zzso zzso Through the use of zzso zzso the kinetic zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was determined in two lines of living zzso cells of zzso origin and normal zzso zzso Like other fluorescent zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso in zzso zzso however, unlike other zzso it appeared to be accumulated in a zzso zzso Also, unlike traditional fluorescent zzso zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of cell growth, showed preferential zzso of zzso zzso melanoma cells and zzso cells derived from breast cancer zzso when compared to normal cardiac zzso Further analysis of zzso zzso properties using both zzso obtained and simulated values revealed the likelihood of membrane zzso and oral zzso of the zzso These zzso properties of zzso were also used to predict its zzso zzso lending zzso to data observed by zzso zzso
