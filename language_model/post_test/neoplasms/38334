In order to reduce the sensitivity of zzso treatments to organ motion, compensation methods are being investigated such as gating of treatment delivery, tracking of zzso position, zzso scanning and planning of the treatment, zzso An outstanding problem that would occur with all these methods is the assumption that breathing motion is zzso throughout the planning and delivery process of zzso This is obviously not a realistic assumption and is one that will introduce zzso A dynamic internal margin model zzso is presented that is designed to follow the zzso trajectory and account for the zzso in respiratory zzso The model statistically describes the variation of the breathing cycle over time, zzso the uncertainty in motion zzso and phase zzso in a polar coordinate system from which margins can be zzso This allows accounting for an additional gating window zzso for gated treatment delivery as well as minimizing the area of normal tissue zzso The model was illustrated with abdominal motion for a patient with liver cancer and tested with internal zzso lung zzso zzso The results confirm that the respiratory zzso around exhale are most zzso and have the smallest variation in motion zzso and phase zzso 2 zzso More importantly, the margin area covering normal tissue is significantly reduced by using zzso margins (as opposed to conventional zzso as the angular component is by far the largest contributor to the margin zzso The statistical approach to margin zzso in addition, offers the possibility for advanced online zzso and updating of breathing variation as more data become zzso
