In phase II clinical trials in zzso the potential efficacy of a new treatment regimen is assessed in terms of zzso zzso The standard approach consists of a zzso zzso design where a single zzso zzso is compared to a specified target zzso However, a new drug would still be considered promising if it showed a lower tumor response rate than the target level but would lead, for example, to disease zzso 

We present an zzso solution for the calculation of the type I and type II error rate for a zzso design where the hypothesis test considers two zzso and provide optimal and zzso zzso Furthermore, the problem of zzso about the two single zzso following rejection of the global zzso hypothesis is addressed by zzso a multiple test procedure that controls the zzso type I error rate in the strong zzso 

The proposed methods are illustrated with a real data example, and the new design is tabulated for a wide range of zzso zzso Similar to zzso designs with a single zzso the characteristics of optimal and zzso designs with two zzso with respect to expected and maximum sample size can be quite zzso zzso the choice of an admissible design may be a valuable zzso 

The new procedure extends Simon's zzso design to two zzso This approach allows a more comprehensive assessment of the overall picture of zzso efficacy of a new treatment than restriction to a single zzso
