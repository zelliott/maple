zzso zzso T cells are major players of zzso immune responses, as their functional activity can limit tumor growth and zzso Data show that zzso T cells efficiently control the proliferation of tumor cells through major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso T cells in zzso tissue does not always correlate with better prognosis and increased survival of cancer zzso Similarly, adoptive transfer of zzso zzso T cells has only shown marginal improvement in life spans of patients with zzso zzso In this report, we discuss experimental evidence showing that expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso presence of their zzso on the surface of zzso zzso directly compromise zzso zzso T cell immune responses and, perhaps, undermine the promise of adoptive zzso T cell zzso Furthermore, we describe novel strategies designed to counteract zzso zzso and zzso effects and highlight their targeting potential for creating more effective zzso immune zzso We believe that Gal and their zzso represent an zzso targeted molecular paradigm that warrants clinical zzso
