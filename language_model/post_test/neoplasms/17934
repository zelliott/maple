Cancer is an age-related disease, and the increase in life expectancy will lead to a progressive increase of cancer cases in the elderly zzso or zzso years of zzso We have created a group called zzso zzso zzso zzso to apply cancer geriatric assessment in elderly cancer patients, in order to select which of them are eligible for zzso treatment or supportive care zzso 

We applied this model to evaluate 153 patients from March 2004 to August zzso Our model included three categories of zzso frail (at least one of the following zzso zzso of Daily Living scale zzso zzso or zzso zzso unrelated to the tumor according to the zzso Index, performance status zzso or zzso or zzso according respectively to zzso and the zzso scale, zzso or zzso geriatric zzso borderline zzso with multiple zzso not affecting performance status or ability in daily zzso zzso 

zzso the aforementioned criteria, we found 30 zzso 14 frail and 109 zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a significant difference in mortality between frail and zzso patients zzso zzso whereas there was no difference between borderline and zzso zzso 

Our model was thus able to identify patients at higher risk of zzso These results confirm the importance of cancer geriatric assessment also for the clinical evaluation of zzso zzso Additional zzso studies with a larger number of patients, also in an zzso setting, should be performed to confirm the effectiveness of this zzso
