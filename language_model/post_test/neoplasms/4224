To design zzso zzso protocols that are expected to be at least as clinically zzso (in terms of both tumor control and late zzso as continuous zzso zzso regimens, but that involve zzso only during extended office zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso protocols are zzso 

The linear zzso zzso was used in which the late normal tissue damage and tumor control for one protocol relative to another are assumed to be determined primarily by the level of cellular zzso zzso schedules were designed in which zzso are delivered during zzso office zzso (8 zzso to 8 zzso with no zzso zzso Generally, the proposed zzso regimes last the same number of treatment days as the corresponding zzso regimen, but the zzso treatment lasts longer on the final day zzso until 8 zzso zzso doses were calculated such as to produce a tumor control which is equivalent to standard zzso zzso and the corresponding predicted late complication rate was compared with that for zzso zzso of plausible values for the zzso of zzso damage repair for tumors and for zzso normal zzso were zzso 

As has been previously zzso the efficacy of zzso relative to zzso depends considerably on the repair rates for zzso damage zzso Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that average repair zzso for early effects zzso tumor zzso are less than about a half hour, and for late zzso are more than about an zzso If these estimates are correct, daytime zzso regimes can usually be designed which take the same number of days as the corresponding zzso regimen, but have comparable or better therapeutic ratios than zzso 

zzso for zzso can be designed to involve zzso only during extended office hours, that are likely to result in clinical results comparable or better than zzso for any expected combination of the repair zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The suggested protocols allow all of the advantages of a computerized zzso zzso while preserving the benefits of low dose zzso In addition, the protocols could allow the patient to go home overnight, or to stay overnight in an adjacent medical inn or zzso hotel, rather than in a hospital zzso could have major economic zzso In such an economic situation, an extra treatment day for the daytime zzso could well be considered, which would virtually guarantee an improved clinical advantage relative to zzso
