zzso zzso zzso is a selective zzso II zzso inhibitor eliminated mainly by zzso zzso I zzso We performed a candidate gene study to investigate whether zzso genetic variation contributes to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso and seven liver expression quantitative trait zzso were zzso in White patients with advanced zzso solid tumors zzso and leukemia zzso We found a significant decrease in clearance zzso zzso in solid tumor patients with zzso although it failed to replicate in the leukemia cohort zzso zzso Four other zzso zzso were associated with clearance zzso in only one of the two zzso Our study provides a starting point for future investigations on the functionality of zzso zzso However, zzso in zzso clearance cannot be attributed to zzso in zzso
