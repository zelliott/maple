zzso zzso coli zzso protein is a large tumor zzso that is truncated in most zzso zzso The zzso third of zzso protein mediates direct interactions with zzso and the zzso zzso tracking protein zzso In addition, zzso has been localized to zzso regions of cells, but the mechanism and functional significance of this zzso have remained zzso Here we show that zzso zzso basic domain of human zzso protein zzso bound directly to and bundled zzso filaments and associated with zzso stress fibers in zzso zzso zzso filaments and zzso zzso for binding to zzso but zzso also could zzso zzso filaments and zzso at specific zzso suggesting a possible role in zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso in zzso were inhibited by its zzso zzso and zzso of zzso prevented zzso association with stress zzso Point zzso in zzso that disrupted zzso binding relieved the zzso in zzso and restored zzso zzso to stress fibers in zzso demonstrating that zzso regulation is zzso Because tumor formation and zzso involve coordinated changes in the zzso and zzso zzso this novel function for zzso and its regulation by zzso may have direct implications for understanding the molecular basis of tumor zzso
