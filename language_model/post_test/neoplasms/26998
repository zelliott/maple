In this paper, we provide an overview of targeted zzso therapies with small zzso zzso zzso First, we discuss why a single zzso active zzso emanating from a variety of zzso genetic zzso is capable of transforming a normal cell, leading it to acquire the hallmarks of a cancer zzso To draw attention to the fact that zzso zzso in targeted cancer zzso differs from conventional zzso chemotherapy, we exploit a conceptual framework explaining why suppressed zzso activity will selectively kill only the so-called zzso zzso cancer cell, while sparing the healthy zzso Second, we introduce the protein zzso zzso in light of its common active zzso with precisely positioned structural zzso and the diversified zzso zzso among the zzso zzso zzso the detailed zzso mechanism of individual zzso is essential to relate the observed zzso zzso to the elevated zzso active state, to identify the mechanism of zzso drug resistance, and to guide the development of the next-generation zzso To clarify the vital importance of structural guidelines in studies of zzso we explain how zzso zzso in zzso result in zzso zzso zzso Third, in addition to the common theme of secondary zzso zzso that prevent drug binding from blocking a signaling zzso which is hijacked by the zzso activated zzso we discuss scenarios of drug resistance and zzso by zzso zzso that bypass the zzso zzso in a vertical or horizontal zzso zzso these suggest that the future challenge of cancer therapy with small zzso zzso zzso will rely on the discovery of distinct combinations of zzso drugs to target individual zzso of different zzso
