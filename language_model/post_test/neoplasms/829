There is a large body of evidence that the consumption of fruit and vegetables can decrease the risk of zzso However, the link between diet and health is extremely zzso Some dietary zzso seem to offer protection in an zzso manner and many molecular targets and signaling pathways affected by zzso have been zzso Although in zzso studies have contributed significantly to our understanding, quite a number use zzso orders of magnitude greater than those achievable in humans or toxic to normal zzso zzso by toxic zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for breast zzso Such studies may produce results that are zzso zzso thus hindering predictions of zzso Here, we argue for careful consideration to be given to the in zzso experimental conditions under which dietary zzso are zzso Design features, such as the use of appropriate nontoxic zzso extended treatment times, three-dimensional cultures, primary tumor cultures, and comparison of zzso of various cancer zzso should improve our understanding of their molecular zzso This in turn would facilitate predictions as to their potential usefulness in the zzso
