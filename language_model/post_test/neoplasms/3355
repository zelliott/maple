The sequencing of the human zzso and the zzso of many molecular pathways important in cancer cell zzso zzso and zzso have provided unprecedented opportunities for development of new agents to prevent and treat zzso The types of molecules in development are increasingly varied and include small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, the variety of zzso agents in clinical development is now greater than ever before, and the number of agents currently in clinical trial for various cancer indications is estimated to exceed zzso Many of these drugs would be expected to work in only narrowly defined patient populations that must be zzso zzso Thus, the development of the therapeutic agent must often be linked to the development of a molecular diagnostic zzso Drugs that produce primarily zzso effects might not be expected to produce zzso of tumor zzso thus, evaluation of such agents would best be done in populations of patients with low tumor burdens but high risk of disease zzso As traditional clinical end points prove more difficult to apply in evaluation of zzso targeted therapies, a great need exists to define and validate surrogate markers of effect and of zzso New clinical trial designs and end points are necessary to permit more efficient evaluation of putative cancer zzso This editorial will review commonly used clinical trial end points and describe their potential advantages and disadvantages to zzso the drug approval process required in the United zzso
