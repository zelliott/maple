The last decade has been characterized by a major investigative thrust into the physiology of two unique but ubiquitous zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso The regulatory systems that control the tissue zzso of the zzso have been zzso and zzso signaling mechanisms have been zzso Clearly, both tissue and circulating growth factor zzso are important in defining the relationship between zzso and cell zzso Bone, liver, and circulatory zzso have received the most attention by investigators, in part because of the ease of measurement and the interaction with disease states such as zzso More recently, attention has focused on the role zzso plays in zzso transformation and zzso Two large prospective zzso studies have demonstrated greater risk for prostate and breast cancer associated with high circulating zzso of zzso Animal models and in zzso studies confirm that there is a close, albeit complex, interaction between zzso signaling and bone zzso This report will focus on: zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso zzso the relationship between zzso and bone mass in respect to risk for zzso zzso the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso and zzso the association between serum zzso and cancer zzso The zzso remain a major area for basic and clinical zzso future studies may define both diagnostic and therapeutic roles for these peptides or their related proteins in several disease zzso
