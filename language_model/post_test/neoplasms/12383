zzso experiments are expected to contribute significantly to the progress in cancer treatment by enabling a precise and early zzso They create a need for class prediction tools, which can deal with a large number of highly correlated input zzso perform feature selection and provide class probability estimates that serve as a zzso of the zzso zzso A very promising solution is to combine the two ensemble schemes bagging and boosting to a novel zzso called zzso 

When bagging is used as a module in zzso the resulting zzso consistently improves the zzso performance and the probability estimates of both bagging and boosting on real and simulated gene expression zzso This zzso improvement can be obtained by simply making a bigger computing zzso The advantageous zzso potential is also confirmed by comparing zzso to several established class prediction tools for zzso zzso 

Software for the modified boosting zzso for benchmark studies and for the simulation of zzso data are available as an R package under zzso public license at zzso
