zzso zzso a characteristic marker of B cells, has been reported to be expressed in zzso cells, with a suggested role in their growth and zzso We have previously reported that zzso heavy chain is expressed in acute zzso leukemia zzso but not in the zzso or zzso from patients with zzso zzso or healthy zzso In the present study, we assessed zzso heavy chain expression and repertoire in human zzso zzso We detected zzso zzso and expression in 7/7 zzso cell lines, zzso primary zzso from zzso patients, and interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso and healthy zzso We also found evidence of zzso zzso of the variable zzso gene segments in zzso zzso gene zzso but not in zzso from zzso or zzso from patients with zzso zzso and healthy zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso cell lines, primary zzso and zzso and zzso from patients with zzso zzso showed a restricted V usage and repertoire, whereas the zzso gene zzso in zzso and zzso from healthy individuals displayed more zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso but did not induce zzso in zzso cell zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso might be a novel zzso zzso that is involved in zzso and zzso progression and might serve as a useful molecular marker for designing targeted therapy and monitoring minimal residual zzso
