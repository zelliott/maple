zzso cells zzso are professional zzso cells capable of initiating a potent primary immune response, making them an attractive target for cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor that efficiently zzso DC expansion in zzso To achieve a more efficient and effective method of zzso zzso zzso immune response, we generated a DNA vaccine zzso both human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso is able to induce zzso zzso immunity in zzso resulting in a potent zzso response, and that the zzso component is essential to the efficacy of the DNA zzso Moreover, the route of zzso is critical in determining the type of immune response zzso intramuscular zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso protection in contrast to poor response with zzso intravenous zzso zzso zzso we observed a massive zzso of zzso cells to the injection site, comprised predominantly of zzso zzso zzso we propose that zzso acts as an zzso to recruit DC, thereby zzso the zzso zzso However, systemic expansion of DC prior to zzso did not enhance the specific cellular response, suggesting that it is in zzso recruitment or expansion of DC that is critical for zzso zzso
