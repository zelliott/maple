zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from 12 patients with zzso zzso melanoma, zzso cell zzso or breast zzso were expanded in zzso for 22 to 45 days zzso 33 zzso and analyzed for zzso zzso expression and patterns of zzso gene zzso All zzso cultures were significantly enriched for T cells, with zzso zzso cells zzso in 8 of 10 cases tested, and demonstrated an zzso (rather than zzso pattern of zzso gene zzso Nine of 12 cultures could effectively lyse the zzso targets in short term zzso release zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso for zzso and zzso zzso and, in 5 of 9 zzso cases, zzso stimulating factor zzso but not zzso beta or zzso zzso zzso zzso deprived of zzso for 4 days did not zzso express zzso for any of the zzso zzso One long term zzso line in culture was followed and periodically tested for zzso activity and zzso zzso Loss of the specific zzso but not zzso activity at day 85 was associated with disappearance of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso may provide a useful marker for functionally characterizing different T cell zzso and may provide zzso of the in zzso zzso effects of these cells when zzso are zzso transferred into zzso zzso
