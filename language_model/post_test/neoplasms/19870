zzso zzso is a plant widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, zzso for its zzso zzso To identify active substances responsible for this effect, we investigated pharmacological effects of 11 compounds isolated from the seeds of this plant zzso described zzso 7, zzso zzso and zzso 

The influence of distinct compounds on different signal zzso pathways zzso zzso survival, zzso and zzso was screened via analysis of the activity of 24 protein zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso via Western zzso zzso was shown using the zzso zzso zzso and determination of zzso zzso zzso stress was detected via zzso zzso 

Some compounds showed zzso effects zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly zzso via induction of zzso zzso compounds caused a strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso weak effects on zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso and no significant effect on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso C and, to a lesser extent, zzso are potent protein zzso zzso zzso concentration 50% values for zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso and zzso are zzso involved in cellular zzso an zzso of these zzso may be useful to cause zzso zzso 

zzso compounds isolated from zzso showed a high potential to influence cellular zzso zzso by zzso of protein zzso that may be interesting for pharmacological zzso
