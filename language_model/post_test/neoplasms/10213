zzso combination trials have recently attracted enormous attention in zzso zzso There are several strong motivations for combining different agents in a zzso to induce the synergistic treatment effect, to increase the dose intensity with zzso zzso and to target different tumor cell zzso To accommodate this growing trend in clinical trials, we propose a zzso zzso design for dose finding based on zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso In the search for the maximum tolerated dose zzso we continuously update the zzso estimates for the unknown parameters associated with marginal probabilities and the correlation zzso based on the data from successive zzso By zzso the dose toxicity probabilities in the two-dimensional space, we assign each coming cohort of patients to the most appropriate dose zzso We conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the proposed method under various practical zzso Finally, we illustrate our zzso procedure with a clinical trial of agent combinations at zzso zzso Anderson Cancer zzso
