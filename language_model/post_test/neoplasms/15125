The zzso DNA is wrapped around zzso zzso which consist of four different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso tail of each zzso is zzso zzso The modification patterns constitute codes that regulate zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso including zzso Recent progress in technology development has made it possible to perform systematic zzso studies of zzso zzso This helps immensely in deciphering the zzso codes and their biological zzso In this review, we discuss the zzso modification patterns found in zzso studies in different biological models and how they influence cell differentiation and zzso
