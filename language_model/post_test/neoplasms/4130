Bone zzso transplant zzso implies the treatment with substances which may compromise the nutritional condition, thus increasing the zzso of these zzso The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the nutritional support zzso protocol for patients subjected to a zzso in our zzso 

55 patients were included (24 men and 31 zzso who were subjected to zzso during 1994, with prior chemotherapy depending on the underlying zzso The nutritional condition zzso was evaluated upon initiation and at the end of the zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was given by total zzso nutrition zzso adapted to the needs, as of the second zzso day, until such time that oral nutrition was sufficient to supply the nutritional needs of the zzso oral zzso was permitted at all times, according to the possibilities of the zzso For the statistical analysis, we used the zzso zzso test, zzso Chi squared test, and zzso test, with differences being considered significant for values zzso zzso 

The average duration of the zzso was 16 zzso 6 days, with a significantly longer time zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso The NC assessment was no different at the beginning and at the end of the zzso although all groups show a drop in the zzso levels at the end with respect to those at the beginning, with this being statistically significant in patients with leukemia zzso zzso zzso and with solid tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso of the patients maintained an acceptable oral zzso (with zzso having zzso and zzso did not show any associated oral zzso zzso better zzso maintenance was correlated with acceptable oral zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso support of patients subjected to a zzso is effective for maintaining their NC zzso The longest duration of the zzso the lowest frequency of associated oral zzso and the greatest decrease of the serum zzso levels are seen in those cases which had the most aggressive chemotherapy prior to the zzso which requires adaptation of the zzso in function of the underlying zzso The association of oral zzso may be beneficial due to its effect on the gastrointestinal zzso
