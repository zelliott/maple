The zzso of tumor molecular expression in zzso could have a significant impact for zzso and monitoring emerging targeted therapies in zzso zzso imaging of targeted zzso can be used to zzso zzso expression in the form of a binding potential zzso if the zzso input curve or a surrogate of it is also zzso However, the assumptions of the most common approaches zzso tissue zzso may not be valid for use in zzso In this study, the zzso of reference tissue models is investigated for use in tumors zzso and in zzso Three different tumor lines were grown zzso in zzso mice and the mice were injected with a mixture of an zzso growth factor zzso fluorescent zzso and an zzso fluorescent zzso A zzso plasma input model demonstrated that the transport zzso of both zzso was significantly different between tumors and all potential reference zzso and using the reference tissue model resulted in a theoretical zzso in zzso of 50% zzso zzso On the other hand, the targeted and zzso zzso demonstrated similar transport zzso allowing a zzso approach to be employed to accurately estimate zzso (with a theoretical error of zzso zzso zzso These findings highlight the potential for using a zzso approach to zzso zzso expression in tumors with abnormal zzso possibly to inform the choice or progress of molecular cancer zzso
