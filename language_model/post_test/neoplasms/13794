The objective of this study was to measure the zzso of tumor necrosis zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso of different causes and to verify whether zzso zzso zzso and complement factors zzso and C4 can be used in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso One hundred zzso zzso zzso of various origins were zzso zzso zzso and complement factors zzso and C4 zzso were measured simultaneously in blood and zzso zzso using commercially available zzso zzso zzso were classified as zzso 102 zzso and 43 zzso All variables were found to have good diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso analysis, four variables were selected, producing a significant zzso function zzso zzso zzso Their order of selection was zzso zzso C4 serum, zzso and zzso zzso Combined use of these variables increased remarkably the diagnostic value (in diagnosing zzso versus zzso giving sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso positive zzso value zzso zzso negative zzso value zzso zzso zzso of zzso complement factors zzso and zzso and zzso may be a significant zzso in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso particularly in those patients with zzso zzso Moreover, the combination of them significantly increased their diagnostic zzso
