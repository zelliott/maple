An association between zzso zzso zzso and mortality has been reported, but studies are limited to older adults or high-risk zzso 

We investigated the association between OH (a decrease of 20 zzso zzso in zzso blood pressure or a decrease of 10 zzso zzso in zzso blood pressure on zzso and zzso mortality among middle-aged black and white men and women from the zzso zzso in Communities Study zzso At zzso zzso participants zzso had zzso zzso mortality was higher among those with zzso than without zzso zzso After we controlled for ethnicity, zzso and age, the hazard ratio zzso for OH for zzso mortality was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso Adjustment for risk factors for cardiovascular disease and mortality and selected health conditions at baseline attenuated but did not completely explain this association zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso This association persisted among zzso that zzso excluded those who died within the first 2 years of follow-up and zzso were limited to those without coronary heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, or zzso perceived health status at zzso In analyses by causes of death, a significant increased hazard of death among those with versus without OH persisted after adjustment for risk factors for cardiovascular disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and other deaths zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not for cancer zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

OH predicts mortality in middle-aged zzso This association is only partly explained by traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and overall zzso
