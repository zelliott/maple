To explore factors influencing functional status over time after cancer surgery in adults aged 65 and zzso 

Secondary data analysis of combined data zzso 

Five zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical studies conducted at three academic centers in the northwest and northeast United zzso 

Three hundred zzso zzso patients diagnosed with zzso system, zzso zzso and zzso zzso treated primarily with zzso 

zzso status, defined as performance of current life roles, was measured using the zzso Social zzso zzso and the Medical Outcomes Study zzso zzso zzso zzso physical component summary zzso after surgery zzso and again at 3 and 6 zzso Number of symptoms, measured using the zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of each additional common cancer symptom on functional zzso 

After controlling for cancer site and stage, zzso symptoms, psychological status, treatment, and demographic zzso functional status was found to be significantly better at 3 and 6 months after surgery than at zzso zzso associated with better functional status included higher income and better mental zzso zzso associated with poorer average functional status were a greater number of symptoms and zzso zzso reporting three or more symptoms experienced statistically significant and clinically meaningful poorer functional status than those without zzso zzso reporting three or more zzso were also found to have poorer functional status than those without zzso No significant relationship existed between age and functional status in patients aged 65 and zzso 

zzso other than age affect recovery of functional status in older adults after cancer zzso
