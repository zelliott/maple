The application of zzso to the cancer field for zzso imaging or diagnostic purposes represents an advanced and very attractive approach to overcome the main limits related to conventional zzso In particular, zzso zzso can be engineered to provide adequate features to overcome the main biological barriers encountered by free zzso zzso 

This review will try to zzso the design rules - as dictated by biological requirements - to take into account for proper zzso design and to highlight the potential of administration routes other than zzso 

Although intravenous injection remains the most investigated route of administration for zzso research interest towards less explored administration routes allowing zzso chemotherapy or delivery in close proximity to the zzso site might change the way cancer is treated in the near zzso Nevertheless, an experimental zzso more biologically oriented taking into account an in-depth evaluation of stability in complex media, protein interaction, and cell interaction of novel zzso could allow their successful translation in zzso and clinical zzso
