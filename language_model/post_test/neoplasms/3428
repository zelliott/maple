zzso zzso and zzso are a family of central zzso proteins with zzso and zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso protein zzso zzso type III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso interacts with zzso class of zzso zzso We investigated expression of human zzso zzso in normal zzso cancer cell lines, and primary zzso zzso probe zzso position zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was almost zzso expressed in various normal zzso zzso level of zzso zzso was relatively lower in bone zzso and peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso was relatively highly expressed in gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso and lung cancer cell line zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was almost zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso in 12 out of 14 cases of primary kidney tumors, 10 out of 18 cases of primary zzso tumors, 3 out of 8 cases of primary gastric cancer, 3 out of 3 cases of primary prostate zzso Because zzso zzso increased expression of zzso type III zzso at the cell surface and enhanced responsiveness to zzso zzso of zzso zzso in tumors might promote cellular proliferation through interference of zzso zzso
