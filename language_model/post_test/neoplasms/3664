The risk of acquiring both zzso B virus zzso and zzso C virus zzso infections in patients with zzso disorders has been zzso However, the impact and risk factors for such infections from different geographical areas vary, and the use of both zzso and molecular zzso to determine zzso infections has been our zzso Children from a zzso unit zzso in zzso were studied for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies for the latter used both zzso zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso The children from the zzso included patients with zzso lymphoma, other zzso and anemia and a smaller group with other zzso zzso As a control group, children from other units at the same hospital were zzso as well as health care workers attending both patient zzso zzso clinical and personal data for each child at the zzso were obtained for statistical zzso Of the 625 children from the zzso enrolled in this study zzso were infected with zzso and zzso had a prior or present zzso zzso In the child patient control group zzso had zzso markers and all were negative for zzso The group of children with leukemia had the highest infection rate for both zzso and zzso However, the determination of zzso was found to have an overall low sensitivity in children from zzso and a zzso consisting of a molecular zzso to determine zzso zzso was performed to better establish the total number of zzso subjects in this zzso The highest independent risk factor for infection was zzso The very high prevalence rates for both zzso and zzso infection in this patient group indicate an urgent need to implement better control of known risk factors and to consider the use of both zzso and molecular zzso for zzso diagnostic zzso
