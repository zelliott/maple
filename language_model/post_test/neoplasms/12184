The in zzso modulating effect of zzso zzso zzso on the metabolism of zzso was studied in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, that were zzso with zzso the incorporation of zzso zzso zzso into DNA was significantly increased by zzso in comparison with cells that were only treated with zzso The increased incorporation of zzso into DNA in zzso zzso cells was paralleled by an increase in zzso and zzso cells of zzso In zzso cells that were zzso with zzso increased zzso of the zzso and zzso form of zzso were observed, as well as an increased incorporation of zzso into DNA zzso This increased incorporation was paralleled by a significant increase in zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso enhances the incorporation of zzso into DNA and thus increases the zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
