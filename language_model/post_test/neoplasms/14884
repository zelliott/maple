zzso zzso genes zzso are characterized by their ability to inhibit the formation of zzso while not affecting the growth of the primary tumor in zzso zzso the first zzso to be zzso has been shown to alter both gene and protein expression in cancer zzso Recently, zzso expression profiling revealed that zzso zzso zzso which encodes for a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso into cells that express zzso overcame the zzso zzso ability of zzso in both in zzso pulmonary colonization and spontaneous zzso zzso In addition, isotope capture affinity tag zzso zzso analysis was performed to identify zzso expressed proteins not accounted for by zzso zzso zzso identified several zzso regulated zzso including zzso a protein involved in differential zzso zzso The contribution of alternative zzso zzso to cancer and cancer zzso is poorly zzso It is possible that zzso through the regulation of zzso processing zzso may play a role in zzso zzso
