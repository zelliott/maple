The objective of this investigation was aimed to explore the cancer targeting potential of folate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under strategic influence of folate zzso zzso (all trans zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso The folate zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and characterized by zzso and zzso zzso The cell line studies investigations were performed on zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso and zzso folds selective zzso of folate zzso respectively, when compared with zzso control, after 48 h of zzso zzso caused zzso more up regulation of folate zzso than zzso treated zzso Both up regulators showed a lag phase of 12 h in zzso the folate zzso After 48 zzso the zzso values of naked zzso zzso and zzso loaded zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, while zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso showed a selectively lowered zzso value of zzso zzso zzso further showed a significant reduction in zzso value in zzso and zzso zzso cells, wherein zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively were zzso The study also concludes zzso to be a superior zzso zzso as well as promoter of folate based targeting compared to zzso
