Nowadays, cancer treatment is moving away from conventional zzso drugs to zzso zzso This is primarily attributed to some remarkable leaps made in deciphering the zzso signaling zzso Among them, zzso cascade presently elicits a substantial amount of pharmaceutical interests zzso to its intimate role in tumor initiation and zzso Additionally, its medicinal potential lies in some protein zzso along the zzso embracing zzso zzso and zzso which regulate crucial cellular zzso During the pursuit of zzso axis zzso medicinal chemistry efforts have zzso into three separate directions for addressing the issues associated with pioneering zzso axis zzso including poor zzso zzso profiles, low zzso specificity and lack of multiple zzso zzso Distinguished from other reviews in the literature, this article will outline these issues in sequence and give an account of recent medicinal chemistry efforts along with updated strides in zzso zzso zzso some candidates developed upon these efforts will be highlighted for their design zzso zzso performance or clinical zzso Rather than merely focus on stunning zzso the review will critically remind us of the underlying challenges in developing zzso axis zzso to direct the future research in this zzso
