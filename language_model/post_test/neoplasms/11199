In this one in a series of articles, the objective was to estimate the ideal proportion of patients with cancer who should receive zzso at least once during the course of their illness based on the best available zzso This estimate should be useful in planning for future zzso zzso zzso rates of zzso for patients with central nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of unknown primary site zzso have not been studied zzso 

A systematic review of evidence-based treatment guidelines for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso An optimal zzso zzso tree was constructed for each of these zzso depicting the indications for zzso at various stages of zzso The proportion of patients who had clinical attributes that indicated a possible benefit from zzso was calculated by adding zzso data to the zzso zzso zzso The optimal proportion of patients who should receive zzso was then calculated using specialized zzso zzso zzso analyses using zzso analysis and zzso Carlo simulations were zzso 

The optimal rates of zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with actual rates of zzso in South Australia, Sweden, and the zzso suggested an zzso of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso However, the actual rates of zzso for zzso zzso exceeded the optimal rate for some zzso although some data may have included radioactive zzso which was not included in the current zzso 

It was possible to estimate optimal zzso zzso rates based on zzso This methodology allowed a comparison of optimal rates with actual rates to identify areas in which improvements in the evidence-based use of zzso can be made, and it may provide valuable data for future zzso service zzso
