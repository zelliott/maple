The zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso therapy zzso has gained significant interest due to their unique ability to convert near infrared light to zzso zzso Previous work mainly focused on the fabrication of green and red emitting zzso to load zzso zzso for zzso In this work, we zzso developed a new zzso zzso combining zzso zzso with zzso excited zzso zzso A, zzso as a zzso zzso zzso for zzso of cancer zzso zzso 20 coated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with strong blue zzso zzso and good water zzso were prepared for use as zzso zzso The blue zzso band matched well with the efficient zzso band of zzso thereby zzso the resonance energy transfer from zzso to zzso and then zzso zzso to produce zzso oxygen zzso The in zzso study showed that these zzso zzso complexes could efficiently produce zzso to kill cancer cells under zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso and zzso containing zzso also exhibited positive contrast effects in both zzso weighted magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso imaging, making them become a zzso platform for simultaneous zzso and zzso
