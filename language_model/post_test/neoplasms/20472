Single zzso zzso are the most abundant genetic markers in the human zzso whose analyses can be easily conducted on a large zzso Most established methods for zzso single zzso zzso analyses are qualitative and are not suitable for genetic analysis of zzso tumor zzso which have compromised tissue integrity and normal tissue zzso Recent studies have focused on the development of quantitative methods for single zzso zzso analyses that can tolerate such imperfections in zzso zzso These methods have been used to measure the rate of zzso imbalance in small zzso and to reveal novel correlations between zzso imbalance and disease progression in zzso zzso zzso quantitative single zzso zzso analysis provides a powerful tool for the identification of novel tumor markers and for the characterization of genetic zzso in human zzso
