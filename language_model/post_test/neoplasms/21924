zzso fatigue syndrome zzso is a common symptom perceived by patients with cancer and consists of reported zzso fatigue, poor zzso and impaired motor and cognitive zzso 

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between a traditional measure of zzso visual analogue scale zzso fatigue ratings, and a set of more objective functional and zzso measures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso body mass index zzso Motor zzso Independence Measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized a relationship could suggest the utility of alternative means of assessing and addressing zzso 

We zzso examined the records of 131 patients admitted to our facility for zzso rehabilitation because of zzso cancer or its zzso 

Of our sample, zzso zzso zzso indicated at least mild fatigue and zzso zzso zzso showed abnormal serum zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso We used multiple zzso analysis to examine the relationship between zzso fatigue ratings and the aforementioned set of functional and zzso zzso The zzso explained a significant proportion of the zzso in zzso fatigue ratings zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso R zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, only Motor zzso zzso accounted for a significant independent contribution to the zzso in zzso fatigue zzso 

The data indicate zzso and functional variables may provide an alternative, objective, and reliable operational definition of zzso Specifically, using Motor zzso zzso as a surrogate for zzso fatigue ratings may be used to measure the efficacy of zzso zzso
