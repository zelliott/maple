zzso is a zzso target of the zzso tumor zzso and encodes an zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso causes a dramatic zzso of zzso expression and triggers differentiation in zzso cells carrying amplified zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly delays development of zzso tumors in zzso We also show that zzso expression is induced upon moderate zzso stress, suggesting a role of the zzso axis in promoting cell cycle re-entry upon zzso cell cycle arrest and DNA zzso Moreover, our findings raise possibilities for the improved treatment of poor prognosis zzso that carry amplified zzso
