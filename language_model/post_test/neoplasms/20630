We have previously reported on the isolation and zzso mapping of a novel human gene zzso which shows sequence similarity to zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso functions as a negative regulator of zzso activity, the latter being implicated in the control of diverse cellular differentiation zzso In the present study we compare the expression patterns of zzso and zzso the human zzso of zzso in normal and zzso zzso We found that, whereas both genes are expressed in fetal zzso at similar levels, they are zzso expressed in normal adult and zzso zzso In normal adult cells zzso is generally present at very low zzso only in the cells of the zzso does it show maximum zzso By contrast, zzso is generally well represented in most zzso cells but not in those of pancreatic and gastric zzso where zzso is either zzso or completely zzso zzso on the other hand is well represented in almost all normal and zzso cells, with very few zzso Our observations suggest that zzso is presumably implicated in pancreatic and gastric zzso and that, along with zzso it is very important for normal cell zzso zzso in the expression of zzso may be used as a zzso marker for gastric and pancreatic zzso
