In zzso zzso transcripts are extensively processed by different zzso events such as alternative zzso and zzso editing in order to generate many different zzso from the same zzso increasing the zzso and then the zzso zzso The most frequent zzso editing mechanism in zzso involves the conversion of specific zzso into zzso by the zzso family of zzso This editing event can alter the sequence and the secondary structure of zzso zzso with consequences for final proteins and regulatory zzso zzso in zzso editing has been connected to tumor progression and many other important human zzso Analysis of many editing sites in various cancer types is expected to provide new diagnostic and zzso markers and might contribute to early detection of cancer, the monitoring of response to therapy, and to the detection of minimal residual zzso
