The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso gave zzso and zzso zzso as a mixture of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso (9 zzso and zzso zzso (20 zzso with sodium zzso afforded zzso zzso (12 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which were converted into zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso 5) by reaction with ammonium zzso The zzso zzso and the site of zzso were established by zzso and zzso nuclear zzso effect difference zzso The structure of compound 23 beta was confirmed by X-ray zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso toward zzso zzso leukemia zzso and zzso human zzso leukemia zzso human zzso leukemia zzso human colon zzso zzso and zzso melanoma at zzso similar to that of zzso In the same test zzso proved to be zzso zzso was found active in zzso in zzso mice zzso with zzso cells with a % zzso of zzso at 25 zzso zzso cells incubation with zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increase in zzso pools zzso with a concurrent decrease in zzso levels zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso higher zzso analogue zzso by zzso than by zzso zzso was converted to the zzso analogue with only zzso zzso The results obtained support the hypothesis that the presence of S in the zzso in position 2 with respect to the zzso bond is essential for the zzso and zzso zzso activity of zzso while the N atom is zzso
