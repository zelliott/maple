zzso is a synthetic zzso zzso that has shown zzso activity both in zzso development and in Phase I work using an zzso zzso The main zzso seen in those studies were dose dependent and mainly zzso with zzso toxicity being far less zzso This Phase I trial of zzso zzso was conducted to potentially alter the toxicity profile and to avoid the neurological side effects seen with zzso zzso zzso criteria included microscopic confirmation of a solid zzso or zzso with a lack of effective zzso zzso Twenty patients were zzso The median age was zzso years, and the median performance status was zzso All but one patient had received prior systemic zzso The starting dose of zzso was 200 zzso zzso for 5 days, and was escalated according to a traditional zzso sequence until the maximum tolerated dose zzso was zzso No zzso deaths were observed during the zzso The zzso was determined to be 800 zzso zzso for 5 zzso zzso zzso included mainly zzso symptoms such as zzso and zzso but zzso symptoms, such as confusion, were seen as zzso zzso was less common and resulted in the zzso of therapy in only two zzso zzso show that the observed zzso is consistent with the zzso zzso and that the zzso of zzso zzso is 49 zzso zzso This regimen can be considered for additional studies in patients with zzso zzso because good central nervous system penetration is zzso Further development of zzso zzso such as zzso should be considered to minimize zzso zzso
