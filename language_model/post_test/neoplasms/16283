We have previously shown that cancer patients with solid zzso disease have increased plasma levels of both the free and total forms of the zzso zzso tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso whereas patients with leukemia and related blood zzso have levels within the normal zzso We now report that also the median plasma levels of the Factor zzso zzso complex were significantly higher in patients with solid zzso compared to patients with zzso zzso and healthy zzso There were significant positive correlations between the zzso complex and total zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso In plasma samples from patients with solid zzso the ratio between the zzso complex and free zzso was zzso times higher than in patients with zzso zzso Increased levels of the zzso complex in solid zzso disease may reflect both increased zzso generation and the increased zzso concentration in the zzso It is speculated that high levels of the zzso zzso complex in cancer patients may protect against zzso and organ failure, which are relatively rare in cancer despite long-lasting zzso
