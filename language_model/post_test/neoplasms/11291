zzso are single chain zzso fragments zzso that spontaneously form zzso zzso of molecular size zzso zzso zzso are almost ideal tumor targeting agents due to their high zzso zzso binding to tumor zzso and small size zzso that leads to improved zzso ratio compared to intact zzso zzso However, due to their high retention and metabolism in the zzso zzso is the current zzso of choice for zzso since zzso is rapidly zzso from the kidney once zzso We have previously shown that zzso gives higher tumor zzso in nude mouse zzso than zzso but has extremely high kidney retention since its zzso zzso are retained by and only slowly zzso from the zzso When a zzso is zzso to a zzso zzso zzso followed by reaction with zzso the resulting product has an apparent molecular size of zzso and a zzso radius of 35 zzso on size exclusion zzso compared to a zzso radius of 25 zzso for intact zzso When zzso the zzso gives high yields of zzso product, retains high zzso and gives improved zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the improved zzso is due to an increase in zzso radius caused by the linear zzso since zzso of zzso with multiple zzso zzso followed by reaction with zzso does not reduce kidney zzso We also show that zzso gives excellent tumor images in the nude mouse zzso model and that zzso gives equivalent images to zzso zzso size, zzso but improved zzso ratios, suggesting that this imaging agent can be used to image liver zzso
