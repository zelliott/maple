During 1988 the first positive steps were taken to proceed with the design and construction of a zzso capture therapy facility on the High zzso zzso zzso at zzso The immediate aim is to zzso within a short time zzso zzso an zzso zzso beam for zzso and filter zzso studies on one of the 10 small zzso horizontal beam zzso The following summer, a much larger zzso zzso zzso in cross section and zzso zzso rate, will be constructed on one of the two large beam tubes that replaced the old zzso column in zzso This latter beam tube faces one whole side of the reactor vessel, extending from a 50 zzso 40 zzso input zzso to a 35 zzso 35 zzso exit zzso The zzso facility will be housed here, with the intention to start clinical trials at the beginning of zzso This paper describes the present status of the project and includes: a general description of the pertinent characteristics with respect to zzso of the zzso results of the recently completed preliminary zzso zzso and computer modeling at the input end of the candidate beam zzso the structure and planning of the proposed Work zzso and the respective direct and indirect participation and collaboration with the Netherlands Cancer Institute and the European zzso Group on zzso
