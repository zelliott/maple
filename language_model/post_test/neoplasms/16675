Follow up data on zzso employees of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority zzso for the period zzso were zzso to investigate the extent to which selection for work on the basis of health affected subsequent death zzso zzso of death were grouped into two broad categories for analysis: all zzso and all other causes of zzso Evidence for an effect of selection of healthy individuals into the zzso was sought primarily by examining zzso mortality ratios zzso by period since zzso zzso for both categories were particularly low during the first two years after recruitment zzso zzso 69, zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso 55, zzso zzso zzso for all other causes of zzso zzso for all zzso did not increase significantly with period since recruitment zzso 2 for trend zzso zzso p zzso zzso but did increase for causes of death other than cancer zzso 2 for trend zzso zzso p zzso zzso Although adjustment for social class strengthened the association between death from causes other than cancer and period since recruitment zzso 2 for trend zzso zzso p less than zzso simultaneous adjustment for all zzso factors considered (age at death, sex, calendar period of death, geographical location of the zzso and social class) produced results broadly similar to those obtained from the zzso analyses for both cause of death zzso zzso remained low even after 25 years of follow up zzso zzso 84, zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso 81, zzso zzso zzso for all other causes of zzso The persistently low zzso observed in this zzso are unlikely to be due to the selection of healthy individuals at the time of recruitment but may be due to differences in zzso and lifestyle zzso The effect on mortality of selection of individuals out of the zzso due to ill health was also zzso zzso were particularly high for both categories in the first two years after termination of employment in individuals who left before normal retirement age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all other causes of zzso In comparison, death rates for the subsequent three years after termination of employment were lower zzso zzso 89, zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso zzso zzso for all other causes of zzso The persistently low zzso observed in this zzso are unlikely to be due to the selection of healthy individuals at the time of recruitment but may be due to differences in zzso and lifestyle zzso The effect on mortality of selection of individuals out of the zzso due to ill health was also zzso zzso were particularly high for both categories in the first two years after termination of employment in individuals who left before normal retirement age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for all other causes of zzso In comparison, death rates for the subsequent three years after termination of employment were lower zzso zzso 89, zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso zzso zzso for all other causes of zzso Apart from this initial fall, there was little evidence of a systematic increase or decrease in mortality with increasing period was not significantly associated with zzso employment for either cause of death category either before or after adjustment for zzso zzso Whereas selection of individuals into or out of the zzso on the basis of health affects the way in which death rates change with time, other factors such as zzso characteristics or health related zzso determine the general level of mortality in the longer zzso The persistently low zzso observed in this zzso throughout the follow up period suggest that selection on the latter factors are likely to have had a considerable effect on death rates in the zzso zzso
