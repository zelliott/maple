Minor zzso zzso zzso are key molecules in zzso disease zzso and the zzso effect after zzso stem-cell transplantation zzso Today, molecular typing methods allow an easy assessment of differences in minor H zzso between patient and donors, so that the zzso risk in individual patients can be zzso However, the large number of minor H zzso prevents matching for them to avoid zzso Interestingly, zzso for minor H zzso might improve the outcome of zzso zzso Some minor H zzso are expressed mainly by zzso cells and can therefore serve as excellent targets for cancer zzso Thus, zzso for zzso minor H zzso allows boosting of the zzso effect of zzso zzso Current research is zzso the impact of zzso donor zzso zzso or functional expression of minor H zzso on the extent of the zzso zzso
