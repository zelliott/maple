A major problem in the management of patients with cancer is the lack of specific tumor markers for the early zzso the accurate prediction of biological behavior and for accurate assessment of zzso A new and exciting answer to this problem may now become available following the discovery of specific genes associated with zzso The role of such genes and their products are now being identified and their role in cancer is under intense zzso On a clinical level, these genes and their products may allow us to improve our understanding of disease zzso and provide more precise zzso zzso and therapeutic characterization of individual zzso This paper discusses the possibilities of using the altered expression of zzso and tumor zzso genes and their products in zzso zzso as markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of zzso zzso These data support the view that detailed analysis of such gene expression has the potential to predict a zzso behavior as well as the response to different treatment zzso
