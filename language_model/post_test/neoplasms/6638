The zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso can be difficult because zzso zzso may be zzso indistinguishable from zzso cells in zzso and other low grade zzso zzso As a result of the present study, diagnostic accuracy can be improved by means of zzso and zzso zzso using an zzso method zzso 30 zzso zzso including 28 zzso 1 zzso and 1 zzso zzso were studied with a panel of zzso anti zzso and anti zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by a predominance of T cells zzso greater than or equal to zzso of all zzso with an excess of zzso cells zzso helper to zzso ratio zzso and by a surface zzso to surface zzso ratio of zzso on zzso zzso zzso showed a similar distribution of zzso whilst most of the zzso zzso showed a lower percentage of T cells zzso value zzso and lower zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso cells in samples of five zzso zzso were characterized by zzso depression (less than zzso zzso in three cases expressed clear cut light chain zzso which was at least suggested in the other two zzso zzso cells from two cases of Hodgkin's disease expressed an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and light zzso using the zzso zzso method zzso may be important to characterize zzso of the plasma cell zzso It is concluded that the chosen panel of zzso in combination with zzso zzso method may be of great value in identifying zzso zzso The technique can be used in the routine laboratory and storage of zzso and zzso slides over long periods is zzso
