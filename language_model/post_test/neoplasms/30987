The zzso characteristics of small peptides zzso with zzso their zzso properties and zzso techniques are zzso 

Physical and chemical characteristics which affect zzso are discussed with particular reference to zzso charge and resistance to zzso General zzso zzso metabolism and zzso zzso as well as tissue zzso zzso are zzso zzso of zzso small peptides with zzso are zzso including discussion of zzso groups for zzso zzso examples drawn either from the literature or from the zzso labeled peptides under development by zzso are zzso 

Although zzso and charge have an impact, the degree of resistance to zzso is a key zzso of zzso zzso In general, zzso and rate of tissue zzso are fast and metabolism occurs mainly via zzso activity in the liver and zzso Although the route depends on a number of factors, zzso also usually is zzso zzso groups for zzso in the zzso zzso state are zzso Site specific incorporation of the zzso groups during zzso synthesis is also zzso Examples of zzso imaging agents zzso zzso imaging peptides zzso and zzso tumor imaging peptides zzso and zzso and zzso imaging peptides zzso and zzso are presented and zzso 

zzso labeled small peptides are characterized by rapid zzso and tissue zzso Furthermore, small peptides are readily zzso and the desired zzso behavior may be engineered into the zzso They are well suited for development as zzso
