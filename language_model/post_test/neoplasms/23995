The aim of the study was to describe the extent of zzso among Italian cancer zzso in data managing practices that may affect differences in zzso and possibly in survival zzso 

a self-administered questionnaire was sent to each participating zzso The definitions of the diseases, of the start point and of the end point of survival zzso were zzso Moreover, information on the proportion of zzso confirmation, of zzso sites and of zzso zzso certificate only) was also zzso 

There were some differences in cancer registration techniques among Italian cancer zzso As regards disease definition, the most relevant problems arose for urinary zzso zzso melanoma should also be considered with some caution, due to zzso among zzso in coding in zzso zzso For the zzso and zzso the proportion of cases that could be differently considered was so limited that no effect on survival is zzso For female breast, zzso and zzso zzso the effect of early diagnosis services (which are active only in some zzso may lead to better survival zzso The zzso in zzso date definition was high among zzso and sites, but its effect on survival was very zzso There was a wide zzso in the proportion of zzso and of zzso zzso known from death zzso which should be considered in survival zzso All the zzso stated that they carried out an active follow-up of their zzso 

In general, quality standards of the zzso are good and allow zzso of survival zzso The zzso of rules adopted by Italian zzso may affect geographic survival differences only in a limited number of cancer sites, so that results should be interpreted with zzso
