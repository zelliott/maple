zzso Web of Science and abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings were searched to identify relevant studies published up to September 9, zzso zzso studies were prospective phase II or III clinical trials using zzso in cancer patients with data on hypertension zzso The zzso and relative risk zzso of hypertension were calculated using a zzso zzso 

Data from a total of 1,069 patients zzso zzso controls zzso from five clinical trials were included for zzso The overall zzso of zzso and high-grade hypertension were zzso % zzso % confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % (95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso in cancer patients was associated with a significantly increased risk of zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso and high-grade zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso The risk might vary with tumor types zzso 

Patients with cancer receiving zzso have a significantly higher risk of developing zzso Close monitoring and appropriate management of this hypertension are strongly zzso
