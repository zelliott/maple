zzso of the essential role of zzso cells zzso as professional zzso cells has prompted investigators to search for methods to use zzso as natural zzso in zzso A number of zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso T zzso zzso specific for cancer cells, have been applied in clinical trials using zzso Such a zzso vaccine with a single zzso for a particular type of zzso class 1 zzso would be zzso However, a zzso vaccine might be more zzso We designed a novel protein delivery system consisting of zzso zzso zzso with target zzso The truncated zzso protein encompassing 147 zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the human zzso of an zzso zzso tumor rejection zzso was zzso We report here that zzso zzso could incorporate zzso zzso zzso protein complexes and process the protein to present major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso The complexes enter zzso by zzso and then the truncated protein is processed through a zzso similar to that for zzso zzso zzso zzso by these complexes primed and zzso zzso zzso T cells in the context of zzso zzso with zzso incorporating these complexes completely suppressed lung zzso in a zzso zzso tumor zzso We also generated 3 zzso clones zzso with different zzso derived zzso peptides from zzso zzso cells in mice treated with zzso Thus, zzso zzso complexes are promising candidates for the construction of zzso zzso
