The gastrointestinal tract and nervous system are the main targets for zzso zzso With the possible exception of certain zzso effects in a few heavily treated patients, all the toxic effects of zzso are transient and zzso on withdrawal of the zzso zzso designed tests for zzso and zzso in rats, zzso and mice have produced convincingly negative results, and no adverse effects on the fetus have been observed in women given the drug for zzso during various stages of zzso The zzso activity of zzso is thought to depend on its zzso to form short-lived zzso zzso capable of reacting with zzso zzso It is therefore perhaps not surprising that zzso has been reported to be zzso for certain strains of zzso zzso zzso gave negative results in the mouse zzso test and no increase in sister zzso exchanges or zzso aberrations in cultured human zzso zzso exposure to zzso in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease was not associated with any increase in the frequency of zzso zzso zzso high-dose exposure of mice to zzso led to an increased zzso of lung tumors in three separate studies and to a suggestive increase in zzso zzso in female animals in one of the zzso These effects are probably zzso since major effects on the zzso of zzso of the same and other kinds have been produced by merely varying the amount of a standard diet that mice zzso A reported excess of liver tumors in rats exposed to zzso can be explained by the fact that the authors failed to age zzso their data despite a big and highly significant beneficial effect of the drug on zzso Two zzso studies in zzso have given entirely negative zzso The follow-up for 10 or more years of 771 women first treated with zzso between 1960 and 1969 for zzso revealed no excess of any form of cancer attributable to treatment, and no excess cancer risk has so far come to light in the zzso follow-up of nearly zzso patients given at least one prescription of zzso between 1969 and zzso At the present time it is reasonable to conclude that this highly useful, and sometimes zzso drug is essentially free of cancer risk or other serious toxic side zzso
