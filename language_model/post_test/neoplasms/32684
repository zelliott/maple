The mechanism of resistance of cancer cells to the zzso drug zzso is not fully zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, we found that the resistant cells have higher membrane potential, as determined by membrane potential sensing zzso zzso zzso spin resonance and zzso polarization studies revealed that the resistant cells have more zzso plasma zzso than the sensitive zzso Because of this observed difference in membrane zzso we attempted modification of the plasma membrane fluidity by the incorporation of zzso acid into zzso and zzso cell zzso We found that such treatment resulted in increased zzso acid content and increased fluidity in the plasma zzso of both cell types, and also resulted in increased zzso resistance in the zzso zzso This finding is in zzso with our results, which showed that the zzso zzso cells have more fluid zzso than the zzso zzso zzso It remains to be determined whether the observed differences in zzso status and/or fatty acid composition alone, or the secondary effect of these differences on the structure or function of some zzso zzso is the reason for increased zzso zzso
