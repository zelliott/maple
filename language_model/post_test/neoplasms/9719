The structural and molecular diversity of vascular zzso may depend on the functional state and tissue zzso of its zzso zzso zzso expresses a number of molecular markers that distinguish it from normal zzso In cancer, the zzso of specific zzso zzso zzso is, in part, dictated by zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso The identification of molecular zzso on the surface of zzso zzso has significantly contributed to the selection of targets, which have been used for delivering therapeutic and imaging agents in zzso zzso drug, zzso zzso zzso zzso and gene therapy zzso have been successfully linked to peptides and delivered to zzso sites with an improved experimental zzso Different diagnostic and therapeutic compounds can be efficiently targeted to specific receptors on vascular zzso zzso the development of zzso zzso tools may promote systemic targeted gene zzso Here, we review the very recent advances in the identification of zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso receptors through the zzso display technology with emphasis on zzso delivery of therapeutic agents and targeted gene zzso
