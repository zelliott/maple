To zzso the contribution of insulin resistance to zzso zzso insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso were examined in 19 cancer patients and five normal controls using the zzso zzso zzso clamp technique combined with indirect zzso zzso zzso and storage were significantly decreased in cancer patients compared with that of zzso In cancer patients, both zzso storage and zzso were positively correlated with zzso zzso as measured by the M value in cancer zzso zzso in zzso zzso was mainly a reflection of decreased zzso storage rather than zzso zzso zzso fat zzso was zzso correlated with both the M value and zzso zzso in cancer zzso In cancer patients with insulin resistance, decreased zzso zzso was closely associated with a rapid decrease in zzso storage, an increase in fat zzso and a mild decrease in zzso zzso suggesting that insulin resistance was connected with the zzso of zzso zzso which may induce host zzso
