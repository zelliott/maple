Little is known about the extent to which individual zzso zzso regulate common processes of tumor biology across diverse cancer zzso Using molecular profiles of zzso tumors from 11 human cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we systematically analyzed expression of zzso and zzso across cancer types to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As we expected, the zzso relationships were consistent with zzso predictions and published data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso target relationships were frequently regulated by genetic and zzso zzso across the studied cancer zzso We also identify new examples of zzso that zzso regulate cancer zzso including the zzso family, which zzso regulates active DNA zzso zzso members zzso and zzso The online resource zzso allows exploration and zzso of zzso interactions that potentially regulate zzso
