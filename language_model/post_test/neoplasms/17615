zzso cells are tumor cells originally induced in zzso mice by zzso zzso zzso In these studies we demonstrated that, although these tumor cells are sensitive in zzso both to zzso by zzso or zzso cells and to the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth of the tumor in zzso could be either inhibited or enhanced by zzso The outcome of in zzso zzso treatment was dependent on the timing and route of zzso administration relative to tumor zzso zzso given systematically at the same time as tumor challenge resulted in enhancement of primary tumor formation, rate of tumor growth and subsequent progressive tumor zzso In contrast, zzso administered at the site of tumor zzso on days 1-3 after tumor challenge inhibited tumor formation and zzso zzso of tissue sections obtained from the site of tumor challenge confirmed these zzso Similar studies performed in mice given 450 zzso of zzso showed that zzso could still inhibit tumor growth when administered at the site of tumor zzso on days 1-3 after tumor zzso zzso administered simultaneously with tumor challenge, however, did not enhance tumor growth in zzso zzso These results are consistent with the interpretation that 1) zzso of zzso tumor growth by zzso has a zzso component and 2) the enhancement of zzso tumor formation by zzso is dependent on interaction with a zzso population of cells, possibly zzso zzso
