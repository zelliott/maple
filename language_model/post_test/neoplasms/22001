zzso zzso tumor gene zzso is highly expressed not only in zzso zzso including leukemia and zzso syndromes zzso but also in various kinds of solid zzso Human zzso T zzso zzso which could specifically lyse zzso tumor cells with zzso class I restriction were generated in zzso We have also demonstrated that mice zzso with the zzso zzso or zzso zzso rejected challenges by zzso tumor cells and survived with no signs of zzso to normal zzso which zzso expressed zzso in zzso and therapeutic zzso Furthermore, we and others detected zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the patients with zzso zzso indicating that zzso protein was highly zzso and that zzso zzso zzso cellular immune responses were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were also detected in peripheral blood or zzso zzso zzso of cancer zzso These results provided us with the rationale for zzso of zzso responses targeting the zzso product for cancer zzso On the basis of the findings mentioned above, we performed a phase I clinical trial of zzso zzso cancer vaccine for the patients with zzso zzso These results strongly suggested that zzso zzso cancer vaccine had efficacy in the clinical setting, because clinical responses, including reduction of zzso blast cells or zzso of tumor masses, were observed after the zzso vaccination in patients with zzso zzso or solid zzso The power of zzso cancer vaccine may be enhanced by combination with stronger zzso helper zzso or conventional treatments such as zzso zzso
