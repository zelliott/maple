zzso modification of circulating zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso has been described in a number of zzso Using Western zzso zzso and zzso analysis of fragmentation patterns of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have examined zzso media from cultured human cell lines for the presence of zzso activity and compared this with the action of circulating zzso and with characterized zzso including zzso D, zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso was incubated with serum from pregnant women, patients following heart surgery and patients with cancer of the breast, lung or zzso Following separation of the zzso samples by zzso a distinct pattern of degradation fragments was observed which was similar in all zzso This zzso activity was inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso had no zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso medium from a human zzso zzso cell line, a zzso a zzso a zzso a zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso cell lines all contained zzso activity which fragmented zzso The pattern of fragments was similar in all cell lines but different from that produced by the circulating zzso Six out of nine cell lines produced zzso which zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso all the characterized zzso tested also fragmented zzso and zzso zzso zzso none of these acted in the same way as either circulating or cell zzso zzso zzso The activity associated with the characterized zzso and cell lines was inhibited in the presence of serum from normal healthy zzso These results demonstrate that the serum of pregnant women, zzso patients and patients with cancer contain circulating zzso which cause fragmentation of zzso but have little effect on zzso zzso zzso were shown to act on zzso and zzso in a number of instances but are not active in the presence of circulating zzso These zzso may play an important role in regulating the availability of zzso to normal and zzso zzso
