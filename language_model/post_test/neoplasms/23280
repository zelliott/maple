zzso zzso access ports for high pressure contrast media injection have been in use in clinical routine for a relatively short zzso The purpose of our study was to compare a high pressure port system with a standard port system with regard to zzso and zzso 

In 94 zzso patients a completely zzso access port was zzso Patients zzso planned for zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso received a high pressure port zzso Other patients zzso received a standard port zzso zzso pain perception, zzso zzso tip migration and complications were zzso 

No major zzso complications zzso zzso pain perception was not significantly different between the two zzso A significantly lower rate of tip migration was observed in the high pressure port group zzso and when the port system was implanted on the right side zzso In the standard port group zzso zzso occurred in three patients zzso and a zzso loop in one patient zzso whereas no such complications occurred within the high pressure port zzso zzso zzso was detected in one patient zzso with a high pressure zzso this did not occur in the standard port zzso 

zzso and use of a high pressure port device is safe and zzso the complications are comparable to those of a standard port zzso High pressure port systems should be considered for zzso especially in patients who will require frequent zzso
