Due to difficulties in conducting zzso studies, most estimates of cancer risk are based on data from animal zzso zzso of cancer risk estimates in animals to humans requires an assumption of equal potency across species based on the average daily zzso The purpose of this paper is to examine the ability to predict tumor zzso across species from DNA zzso zzso resulting from exposure to zzso A zzso range of structurally diverse zzso zzso corresponding to the same tumor zzso raises questions about quantitative predictability across chemical classes and across zzso zzso in zzso structure, zzso efficiency, zzso repair rates, and cellular proliferation could account for some of the zzso For specific zzso zzso the zzso levels associated with a 50% tumor zzso appear to vary over a zzso zzso An equal zzso of liver tumors was obtained at equal zzso of zzso zzso zzso for rats and zzso A zzso to zzso range of zzso zzso zzso between mice and dogs appears to be associated with nearly equal zzso tumor zzso on the basis of limited zzso In humans, a zzso higher concentration of a zzso zzso in zzso of smokers than of nonsmokers is compatible with the relative risk of zzso cancer due to zzso DNA zzso zzso certainly can be used to improve zzso of chemical zzso for zzso zzso Although promising, more data are needed to judge the usefulness of DNA zzso zzso to predict cancer zzso across zzso
