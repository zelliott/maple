zzso rather than covered, metal zzso are commonly used for zzso of zzso gastric outlet obstruction because of the low risk of zzso migration, but tumor zzso risk is a major zzso Few reports address zzso obstruction after gastric zzso 

Our purpose was to compare the technical feasibility and clinical outcome of using an zzso uncovered zzso metal zzso zzso and simultaneous use of uncovered and covered zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso obstruction after gastric zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso care, academic medical center, from August 2000 to June zzso 

Twenty patients were included in the zzso All patients had symptomatic obstruction with zzso zzso and decreased oral zzso 

Ten patients received uncovered zzso the other 10 received double zzso 

To compare tumor zzso and zzso zzso between the uncovered and the zzso zzso 

Technical and clinical successes were 10 of 10 and 8 of 10, respectively, in the uncovered zzso group and 10 of 10 and 10 of 10, respectively, in the double zzso zzso Six of 10 patients zzso with uncovered zzso had tumor zzso compared with 1 of 10 patients with double zzso P zzso zzso Five of 10 patients zzso with uncovered zzso had very early zzso but no patients had early zzso in the double zzso group, P zzso zzso zzso zzso was a median of zzso days zzso zzso zzso in the uncovered zzso group and 150 days zzso zzso zzso in the double zzso group, P zzso zzso Survival duration was zzso days zzso zzso zzso and 150 days zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This was a small retrospective zzso 

zzso double zzso placement seems to be technically feasible and effective for zzso treatment of zzso zzso obstruction after gastric zzso Double zzso placement is important in preventing tumor zzso especially very early zzso and zzso zzso zzso We suggest that this procedure be considered rather than uncovered zzso alone as the primary choice for zzso of obstruction in such zzso
