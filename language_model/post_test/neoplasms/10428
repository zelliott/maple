Cancer poses a massive health burden with zzso rates expected to double globally over the next zzso In the United Kingdom screening zzso exists for zzso breast, and zzso zzso The ability to screen individuals for solid zzso zzso using only a peripheral blood sample would zzso cancer services and permit early diagnosis and zzso zzso zzso zzso native zzso through the interaction of light with matter, producing a high definition zzso zzso of the target zzso This paper explores the possibility of using zzso zzso to discriminate between cancer and zzso patients through a peripheral blood zzso Forty blood samples were obtained from patients with Head and Neck cancer and patients with respiratory illnesses to act as a positive zzso zzso zzso was carried out on all samples with the resulting zzso being used to build a zzso in order to distinguish between the cancer and respiratory patients' zzso zzso using principal component analysis zzso zzso analysis zzso and zzso with a genetic evolutionary zzso The zzso zzso gave a zzso sensitivity and specificity for discrimination between the cancer and respiratory zzso A sensitivity score of zzso with a specificity of zzso was achieved with a zzso evolutionary zzso In conclusion this preliminary study has demonstrated the feasibility of using zzso zzso in cancer screening and zzso of solid zzso through a peripheral blood zzso Further work needs to be carried out for this technique to be implemented in the clinical zzso
