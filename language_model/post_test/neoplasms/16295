The purpose of this study was to examine the degree to which zzso model processes of change zzso and strategies for zzso were associated with smoking status and quitting behavior zzso intentions and attempts to zzso among patients with head and neck or lung zzso The relationship between medical variables and processes of change was also zzso 

zzso smokers and 45 zzso who were recruited from treatment clinics within a comprehensive cancer center completed a brief zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso correlation procedures were used to evaluate hypothesized zzso 

As hypothesized, zzso used behavioral processes such as zzso and reinforcement management significantly more than smokers and used zzso an experiential process, significantly less than zzso zzso to the hypothesis, however, quit attempts and intentions were associated with both experiential zzso consciousness raising and zzso and behavioral zzso reinforcement management and zzso processes of zzso Use of the processes of change was not influenced by medical zzso including cancer type, illness phase, disease stage, type of current medical treatment, and duration of zzso 

These findings suggest that behavioral counseling to promote smoking zzso for patients with cancer should involve assisting the patient to do the zzso develop an awareness of the health risks related to continued zzso devise and use alternative zzso implement the use of reinforcement strategies for zzso zzso and develop a sense of confidence and commitment about quitting as well as healthy lifestyle zzso These strategies are discussed within the context of models and guidelines for smoking zzso in clinical zzso
