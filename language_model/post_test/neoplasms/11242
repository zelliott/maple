A panel of zzso was constructed to zzso zzso zzso zzso fused at its zzso end to various zzso so as to compare their zzso by zzso DNA zzso and zzso injection in zzso and zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso between zzso and the minimized domain of zzso toxin zzso C zzso or the zzso portion of zzso zzso were identified as highly zzso and zzso significant zzso zzso and zzso T cell zzso zzso mice were protected from tumor growth on challenge with zzso tumor cells only when zzso with repeated injections of zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso cells resulted in an increased immune response and zzso effect with DNA plus zzso zzso In addition, this protective effect was zzso if the zzso zzso or zzso cell population from zzso mice was depleted before tumor zzso zzso transfer studies demonstrated that zzso and zzso T cells and zzso contributed to the zzso effect, thus suggesting that a genetic vaccine based on the use of zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso sequences zzso zzso immune responses and effectively protects from tumor zzso
