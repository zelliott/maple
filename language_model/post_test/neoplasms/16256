To explore genes that determine the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso drugs, we investigated using zzso zzso the expression of zzso genes in 39 human cancer cell lines zzso characterized on treatment with various zzso zzso A zzso approach was then exploited to identify genes related to zzso drug zzso An integrated database of gene expression and drug sensitivity profiles was constructed and used to identify genes with expression patterns that showed significant correlation to patterns of drug zzso As a result, sets of genes were extracted for each of the 55 zzso drugs zzso Whereas some genes commonly correlated with various classes of zzso drugs, other genes correlated only with specific drugs with similar mechanisms of zzso This latter group of genes may reflect the efficacy of each class of zzso zzso the integrated database approach of gene expression and zzso profiles may be useful in the development of systems to predict drug zzso of cancer cells by examining the expression levels of particular zzso
