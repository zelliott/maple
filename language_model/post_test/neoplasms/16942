This paper looks at a new approach to the design and analysis of Phase 1 clinical trials in zzso The basic idea and motivation behind the approach stem from an attempt to reconcile the needs of zzso zzso with the ethical demands of established medical zzso It is argued that for these trials the particular shape of the dose toxicity curve is of little zzso Attention focuses rather on identifying a dose with a given targeted toxicity level and on concentrating zzso at that which all current available evidence indicates to be the best estimate of this zzso Such an approach not only makes an explicit attempt to meet ethical requirements but also enables the use of models whose only requirements are that locally zzso around the dose corresponding to the targeted toxicity zzso they reasonably well approximate the true probability of toxic zzso Although a large number of models could be contemplated, we look at a particularly simple zzso zzso simulations show the model to have real zzso
