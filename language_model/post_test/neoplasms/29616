Whereas the association between zzso and pulmonary zzso and zzso has been zzso a relationship between zzso zzso and zzso has not yet been zzso Because zzso manifestations are seen in zzso percent of cases of zzso this association deserves further zzso 

We reviewed the relevant literature, in addition to our case series, for a total of 110 cases of zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso with the aim of analyzing possible associations between zzso zzso and zzso and to enhance the zzso understanding of their critical role in the management of this zzso A search for consecutive cases, which were encountered during the past 20 years, identified 10 cases of confirmed zzso zzso A review of the relevant literature was also conducted to identify cases of zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso was identified in 58 of 100 patients with zzso and cancer found in the literature zzso and in 4 of 10 patients in our series zzso In our series, all cases zzso solid tumors, including breast zzso zzso prostate cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, and zzso cell zzso of the skin zzso of each zzso Among the 6 patients in our series with zzso and zzso zzso the types of zzso encountered were zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso colon cancer zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso developed after an average of zzso years in the literature cases and eight years in our series, following the diagnosis of zzso Among the 100 cases of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso which were extracted from the literature, zzso zzso accounted for 73 percent of cases and zzso preceded the detection of zzso in a majority zzso of zzso Among 110 total cases analyzed in this paper, zzso zzso was confirmed in zzso percent of overall cases, a figure exceeding expected rates of zzso involvement zzso in the general zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso manifestations appears to be associated with zzso possibly at a higher rate than other systemic forms of zzso The zzso occurrence of zzso before the development of zzso may indicate that an immune zzso such as impairment of cellular immunity zzso by zzso or the effects of treatment may contribute to an increased risk of zzso in predisposed zzso zzso recognition of this link between zzso and zzso is zzso zzso in particular, play an important role, given that many of these associated cases manifest initially, or even zzso with zzso zzso
