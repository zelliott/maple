zzso factor 1 zzso zzso is frequently zzso in human tumors and is associated with zzso and zzso zzso a zzso I zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso expression in zzso zzso We designed a pilot trial to measure zzso zzso in tumor zzso from patients with advanced solid tumors zzso zzso after treatment with oral zzso 

zzso was administered orally at zzso zzso once daily for 5 zzso for 2 weeks, in zzso zzso zzso were to determine zzso of expression of zzso and zzso target genes in zzso to assess tumor blood flow by dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and to measure zzso zzso zzso were collected at baseline and during the second cycle of zzso 

Sixteen patients were zzso The dose of zzso was reduced to zzso zzso due to zzso Seven patients had paired tumor zzso In 4 patients, zzso nuclear zzso became zzso after treatment zzso zzso at zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso were measured in 4 zzso the changes were zzso with reduction in zzso in 3 zzso zzso tumor blood flow and zzso were observed by zzso in 7 of 10 patients after 1 zzso One patient had a partial response accompanied by zzso of zzso in tumor and reduction in tumor blood flow on zzso 

This zzso target assessment trial of a small zzso inhibitor of zzso showed that zzso could decrease zzso expression in advanced solid zzso
