The major zzso complex zzso class II genes zzso surface molecules that are required for presentation of zzso peptides to helper zzso The concentration of these proteins on the surface of zzso cells zzso cells such as zzso and zzso is one of the parameters affecting the intensity of the immune zzso Many studies have thus focused their attention on the mechanisms that control the expression of class II zzso particularly in zzso The anatomy of zzso class II promoters has been dissected in detail, and many zzso factors and their zzso DNA regulatory elements have been identified and zzso thus helping to zzso the molecular zzso which determines zzso coordinate expression of these zzso In most cases, regulation has been investigated at the level of zzso zzso zzso class II gene expression has been observed as well, under zzso conditions, in many other zzso and zzso such as brain, zzso zzso and zzso thus zzso that class II molecules may be involved, whether directly or zzso in the zzso of other important biological responses in addition to the control of the immune reaction against soluble zzso zzso zzso class II activity is also detected in tumor cells and in other pathological conditions such as those found in zzso zzso and infectious zzso In zzso cells that express class II molecules may present zzso zzso thus triggering a mechanism of zzso In tumors, instead, unscheduled zzso class II expression may be part of a mechanism that prevents tumor zzso zzso of the regulatory functions operating in pathological conditions as compared to those active in zzso and in zzso is still zzso Because of the possible zzso importance of zzso class II zzso knowledge of the zzso and zzso elements controlling gene expression at either the zzso or zzso level may allow the development of strategies for zzso against these zzso
