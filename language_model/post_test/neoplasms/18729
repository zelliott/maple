Cancer patients are at high risks of zzso interactions zzso zzso need to know the magnitude of zzso so as to better manage their patients' drug zzso We have previously created a novel interaction database for zzso prescriptions zzso In this project, we leverage on 3G networks to further develop this database into an zzso application for the mobile zzso zzso 

Data on zzso drugs zzso chemotherapy regimens zzso and zzso with zzso were compiled from various zzso and online resources, and published articles from zzso Scopus and Science zzso The database and zzso web documents were designed using zzso zzso zzso and associated with a combination of zzso programming zzso 

zzso currently detects over zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between 256 zzso and combination zzso with 51 zzso zzso zzso fits the zzso screen zzso and displays information regarding the regimen, zzso of the drugs and detected zzso in tabular format for improved zzso 

zzso is the first mobile zzso application of its kind which detects interactions for combination zzso Future versions will include zzso with other drug zzso zzso studies on its impact in clinical practice will also be carried zzso
