During the past 25 years, zzso have emerged as a new class of DNA zzso with zzso zzso zzso were first investigated as DNA reaction products of vinyl zzso an occupational zzso causing zzso of the liver zzso They were subsequently shown to be formed by several zzso agents, including zzso zzso zzso and more recently, to occur in various zzso of zzso humans and zzso The zzso source of zzso in DNA is thought to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies on zzso zzso zzso and zzso moved to the analyses of the formation of zzso in zzso and to the determination of their zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso became possible with the development of zzso techniques of zzso To study the zzso properties of zzso the initial zzso on the zzso of replication or of zzso were replaced by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso generate mainly base pair substitution zzso With the advent of new techniques of molecular biology, zzso were investigated in the zzso and zzso genes of tumors induced by vinyl zzso and zzso In liver tumors induced by vinyl zzso specific zzso patterns were found in the zzso gene in human zzso in the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso in rats, and in the zzso gene in human and rat zzso In tumors induced by zzso in mice, zzso 61 of the zzso gene zzso zzso and of the zzso gene zzso seems to be a characteristic zzso These tumor zzso zzso are compatible with the zzso properties of zzso zzso and with their formation in target zzso suggesting that zzso can be initiating zzso in zzso Another recent focus has been given to the repair of zzso zzso and DNA zzso able to zzso these zzso in zzso have been zzso The last two decades have brought zzso to light as potentially important DNA zzso in zzso More research is needed to better understand the environmental and genetic factors that affect the formation and persistence of zzso in zzso
