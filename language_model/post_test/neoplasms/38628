The relationship between zzso zzso and serum calcium concentration zzso was examined in 9 zzso zzso greater than 11 zzso zzso Three zzso intervals corrected by zzso formula were used for the analysis: the intervals from the beginning of the zzso to the onset zzso the zzso zzso and the end of T wave zzso The zzso of zzso and other zzso were made on the blood sample taken on the same day of the zzso zzso zzso The normal range of zzso and three zzso intervals was determined in 50 zzso with no cardiac zzso Three zzso intervals in the zzso patients were significantly shortened with a diminution in the zzso The zzso intervals showed significant negative correlation with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in predicting high zzso was zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and specificity was zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso tended to be prolonged in the case of zzso but the change was statistically zzso These observations suggest that zzso intervals can serve as an indicator of high zzso and that the zzso seems to be a good indicator of the three zzso
