This review focuses primarily on my own research, including zzso mechanisms of microbial infection, vascular zzso in infection and tumors, and effects of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso radical zzso and zzso in the enhanced zzso and retention zzso effect for the zzso delivery of zzso agents zzso zzso vascular zzso is zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso cascade zzso triggered by zzso microbial zzso A similar mechanism operates in cancer zzso and in zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso also stimulates zzso generation via zzso of zzso zzso while generating NO by inducing NO zzso These chemicals function in zzso and zzso and promote zzso in which zzso (a product of zzso and zzso activates zzso damages DNA and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso We showed vascular zzso by using zzso drugs, which are not simply zzso through the vascular wall into the tumor zzso but remain there for prolonged zzso We thus discovered the zzso effect, which led to the rational development of zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso and zzso drugs, and zzso Our zzso acid zzso zzso with zzso was the first agent of its kind used to treat zzso The zzso effect occurs not only because of defective vascular architecture but also through the generation of various vascular zzso such as zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso Although most solid tumors, including human tumors, show the zzso effect, zzso of tumor tissue may impede drug zzso This review describes the barriers and zzso for improved drug delivery to tumors by using zzso
