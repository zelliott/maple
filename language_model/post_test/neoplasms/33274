The zzso zzso family consists of two major zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso and affect mainly zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso In their zzso form, zzso and zzso bind to the same receptors and induce the same biological zzso However, the zzso molecules differ in their zzso within the producing cell or the zzso Thus, zzso is solely active in its zzso form, whereas zzso is mainly active in zzso forms zzso precursor and zzso zzso and only rarely as a zzso zzso mainly by zzso zzso is abundant at tumor sites, being produced by cellular elements of the tumor zzso or by the zzso cells, and it affects not only various zzso of the zzso process, such as zzso tumor growth, and zzso but also patterns of interactions between zzso cells and the zzso immune zzso zzso the effects of the zzso molecules on the zzso process are complex and are often of an opposing zzso Comparative studies on the differential roles of zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso in different stages of the zzso process can subsequently open new avenues for manipulation of zzso expression and function in cancer zzso
