Information on longer-term safety and zzso is needed to confidently prescribe zzso therapy for chronic plaque psoriasis beyond 1 or 2 zzso 

The aim of this work was to further examine the safety profile of zzso by zzso data from clinical trials involving patients with chronic plaque psoriasis who received up to 9 courses of therapy over a zzso zzso 

Data from 13 clinical trials conducted in patients with plaque psoriasis were integrated because they had similar zzso criteria and zzso Patients who enrolled in the analyzed trials were aged zzso or zzso years with chronic plaque psoriasis for zzso or zzso months that involved zzso or zzso of body surface area, and zzso T zzso counts above the lower limit of normal zzso zzso The zzso of adverse events zzso serious zzso zzso for zzso infections, serious infections, zzso and zzso zzso were summarized for each course of zzso The zzso of infections was zzso according to zzso T zzso counts zzso zzso vs zzso or zzso zzso 

Data from 13 clinical trials of zzso were integrated and summarized zzso randomized, zzso studies, zzso zzso 6; zzso zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso other, zzso zzso zzso The analyzed population zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso men and zzso zzso women, between the ages of 15 and 84 years zzso zzso zzso of whom zzso zzso were zzso zzso ranged from 40 zzso to 206 zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso of these patients had been included in a previous zzso Among the most commonly reported zzso in each treatment course were headache zzso zzso zzso influenza zzso upper respiratory tract infection zzso and zzso zzso The rates of zzso due to zzso zzso serious zzso zzso serious infections zzso or zzso zzso did not appear to increase with repeated zzso Fewer than 1 % of patients in each course developed a serious zzso No opportunistic infections or zzso deaths were zzso The zzso of infections appeared to be unrelated to zzso T zzso zzso Fewer than zzso of patients tested positive for zzso zzso during any course of zzso 

This integrated analysis of data from 13 trials with zzso patients supports the safety and zzso of zzso for longer-term treatment of zzso
