Combining long duration mild temperature zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso to enhance therapeutic killing of cancer cells was proposed many years zzso The cellular and zzso research that supports this hypothesis is presented in this zzso Research describing zzso interaction with zzso zzso and high zzso zzso using clinically relevant parameters are compared with zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso has been established as the zzso of zzso damage zzso The molecular mechanisms have been shown to involve DNA repair zzso but the exact nature of these processes is still under zzso The relative differences between zzso interactions with human and zzso cells are presented to help in the understanding of possible roles of zzso in clinical zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso blood flow and its possible role in zzso zzso of zzso is also zzso The positive aspects of zzso for clinical application are zzso zzso the zzso goals zzso time and zzso are achievable with currently available technology, zzso the zzso by itself has no zzso toxic effects, zzso zzso appears to play a minor if any role in radiation zzso zzso zzso of around 2 can be expected, zzso hypoxic fraction may be decreased due to blood flow modification and zzso simultaneous chemotherapy may also be zzso Combined zzso and zzso is a cancer therapy that has established biological rationale and sufficient technical and clinical zzso to be appropriately zzso This zzso is ripe for clinical zzso
