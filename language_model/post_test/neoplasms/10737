Clinical cancer dormancy is defined as an unusually long time between removal of the primary tumor and subsequent zzso in a patient who has been clinically zzso The condition is frequently observed in certain zzso zzso breast zzso zzso lymphoma, and melanoma, with zzso occurring zzso y zzso Clinical data suggest that a majority of breast cancer survivors have cancer cells for decades but can remain clinically zzso for their zzso Thus, there is a major effort to characterize the molecular mechanisms responsible for inducing tumor cell dormancy using experimental models or studying the early zzso of cancer growth in zzso Many molecules and signaling pathways have been characterized and have led to concepts that dominate the field, such as the possible role of innate and zzso immunity in immune surveillance and initiation and maintenance of zzso However, recent clinical data do not support many of these zzso Several areas need further study to determine their relevance to clinical cancer zzso We suggest hypotheses that may contribute to zzso of the mechanisms underlying the dormant zzso
