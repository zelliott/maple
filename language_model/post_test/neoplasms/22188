zzso zzso natural killer zzso cells have a potent zzso effect in zzso stem cell zzso Whether zzso zzso cells are able to specifically kill fresh tumor cells from primary solid tumors was zzso 

zzso cells were zzso from healthy donors for the expression of zzso killer cell zzso zzso receptors zzso ex zzso expanded, and used as zzso zzso Their zzso effect on tumor cells freshly obtained from surgical specimens was assessed by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells from 1 zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso and 4 zzso cell zzso were analyzed and found susceptible to zzso zzso cell killing zzso zzso at an zzso cell to target cell zzso ratio of zzso for tumor cells not expressing at least 1 human zzso zzso zzso class I zzso zzso zzso zzso cells that recognized specific zzso group zzso were able to kill zzso zzso zzso tumor cells, whereas no zzso of target cells occurred with zzso zzso tumor zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso effects might provide useful insights for designing new cell therapy approaches against solid zzso
