The binding of zzso zzso to human cells of the line zzso zzso has been studied with the aid of zzso zzso is concentrated within cells when present in zzso balanced salt solution in the concentration range zzso zzso zzso zzso The time course of binding is zzso with a rapid initial binding and a slower zzso at times longer than 30 zzso The amount bound to zzso increases zzso as the cells proceed through the cell cycle and is doubled from early zzso to late zzso
