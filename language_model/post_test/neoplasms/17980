zzso cell proliferation is frequently associated with genetic or zzso zzso in key regulators of the cell zzso Most known zzso and tumor zzso target entry into the cell cycle and control the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in zzso formation or zzso segregation are also frequent and may result in zzso zzso In fact, a few zzso or zzso proteins such as aurora A, zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso have been reported to act as zzso Some zzso checkpoint regulators such as the zzso zzso or zzso protect cells from zzso zzso segregation and may therefore function as zzso of zzso zzso However, few zzso zzso in these or other zzso regulators have been described thus far and many of these molecules do not fit into the classical definition of zzso or zzso zzso zzso In some cases, both zzso and decreased expression of these genes result in zzso zzso Moreover, some zzso regulators such as zzso are either zzso or zzso depending on the tumor types and, in both cases, these zzso result in zzso imbalances and tumor zzso Minor changes in protein levels that do not compromise cell viability might therefore be sufficient to zzso the zzso cycle and induce zzso zzso Despite the limited knowledge on the molecular basis of these zzso the clinical success of zzso poisons such as zzso reinforces the interest in these zzso their involvement in human cancer and the therapeutic opportunities to zzso their function in cancer zzso
