To enhance the zzso potential of soybean zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso of zzso with an zzso via a zzso carrier was zzso Clinical zzso zzso was used as a zzso zzso carrier for zzso of zzso and zzso A model zzso isolated from sheep serum zzso raised against human zzso was zzso to develop the procedure of zzso zzso The zzso ratio of the ingredients in the zzso was the following zzso zzso of the dose response zzso for the native zzso and the zzso zzso indicated that zzso completely retained its specific activity zzso after modification with zzso The determination of the Ki values for zzso interaction with the native zzso and the zzso zzso indicated high zzso zzso In the next step, the zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso against the zzso human zzso membrane zzso was used for zzso as it is the most universal zzso for targeting different agents to human tumors of zzso zzso The influence of zzso on the specificity of the zzso reaction with its zzso was zzso The zzso zzso reacted with tumor cells of different zzso genesis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not react with tumor cells of zzso zzso It was shown that zzso 25 zzso zzso has almost the same zzso activity as zzso zzso These results demonstrated the feasibility of exploiting the activities of zzso bound zzso and zzso 25 zzso for zzso agent zzso
