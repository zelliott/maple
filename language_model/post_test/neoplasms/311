The initial consideration in use of a zzso in therapy is specificity of zzso A variety of biological principles such as active transport and binding to cellular components have been zzso to achieve this zzso The next concern is to maximize radiation to the zzso while minimizing that to the remainder of the zzso This means that there is a major role to be played by emissions with a short path length (such as alpha zzso weak beta particles and zzso zzso To achieve zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso from the tissue should be zzso potential approaches for achieving this are zzso Finally, zzso zzso between radiation and chemical agents are zzso
