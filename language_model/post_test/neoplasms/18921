zzso models to identify low-risk zzso zzso zzso have been developed with zzso samples, which included stable and unstable patients, solid zzso acute zzso and bone zzso zzso These models fail to zzso zzso of cases with unexpected zzso and literature specifically addressing apparently stable patients zzso is zzso 

We reviewed zzso episodes of zzso in zzso with solid zzso including zzso zzso episodes with apparent clinical zzso We aimed to investigate the prognosis of this latter group and explore the possibility of zzso it according to the presenting zzso A zzso study was performed and the zzso index was zzso 

The rates of complications and zzso in zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso index yielded a low sensitivity to detect complications zzso zzso factors were zzso zzso performance status zzso chronic bronchitis, chronic heart failure, zzso zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and stress zzso 

A very simple assessment is useful to zzso the patients with zzso according to the risk of zzso A few additional variables may predict the clinical course of the zzso We additionally show that the zzso index applied to this specific group has a low sensitivity to predict zzso
