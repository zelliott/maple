zzso zzso plays an important role in many pathological zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of smooth muscle tone and activates many downstream zzso The best characterized are the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso ROCK is necessary for diverse functions such as local blood flow, zzso blood pressure, airway resistance and zzso zzso ROCK zzso permits zzso interactions and smooth muscle cells contraction by maintaining the activity of zzso zzso zzso independently of the free zzso calcium zzso The zzso of smooth muscle zzso to calcium has been implicated in many pathological states, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary hypertension, zzso dysfunction, and zzso The focus of this review is on the involvement of zzso in zzso We will briefly describe the ROCK zzso and the role of zzso in the zzso before exploring the most recent findings regarding this zzso and various zzso
