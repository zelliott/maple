Cancer cells possess unique zzso signatures compared to normal cells, including shifts in zzso zzso zzso and de zzso zzso of zzso zzso these changes with agents zzso and dietary zzso has been employed as strategies to reduce the complications associated with zzso This paper highlights the ability of several food components to suppress zzso zzso zzso including increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso and the detection of such effects using various zzso technologies, including liquid zzso zzso zzso and stable zzso zzso zzso zzso tracing technologies offer exciting opportunities for defining specific zzso for food zzso zzso especially during the early transition phase from normal to cancer, are critical for the translation of knowledge about food components into effective prevention zzso Although appropriate dietary zzso needed to alter cellular metabolism remain inconsistent and/or zzso validated zzso zzso for dietary components hold promise for establishing effective strategies for cancer zzso
