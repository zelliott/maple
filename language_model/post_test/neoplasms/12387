The efficacy and feasibility of donor zzso zzso therapy zzso have changed considerably over the past four zzso The authors sought to determine the impact of high-dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

The zzso zzso retrospective analysis comprised zzso consecutive patients treated at The University of Texas zzso zzso Anderson Cancer Center zzso from 1993 to zzso The cohort included 29 patients with zzso species zzso infection who had received zzso and zzso who had zzso 

Both groups were comparable in age, zzso zzso II score, recent chemotherapy received, zzso zzso systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso or zzso zzso The patients who received zzso compared with those who did not had a higher zzso of underlying leukemia zzso zzso zzso P zzso persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and breakthrough invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was more prolonged in patients who received zzso zzso zzso 10 days, P zzso Also, more of the patients who received zzso had received zzso stem cell zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso exposure zzso 4 weeks) to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and stays in critical care units zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall attributable mortality rate for 25 zzso recipients of zzso was zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso of 254 zzso patients in the control group zzso Of the 158 patients with zzso 25 zzso had received zzso In patients with zzso more of those who had received zzso experienced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso had zzso that was more prolonged zzso 72 hours, P zzso and had more stays in critical care units zzso zzso zzso P zzso On the bases of a reduced zzso model, a significantly increased risk of death was found for patients with zzso stem cell transplantation zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso for patients with persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and for patients with leukemia who also had prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso In patients with zzso death was attributable to zzso in 50% of the zzso recipients, compared with 59% of the zzso patients who had received zzso therapy alone zzso 

Despite the presence of multiple zzso of increased zzso high-dose zzso therapy in these high-risk patients with cancer was associated with better than expected survival zzso
