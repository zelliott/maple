Four years of additional mortality follow-up through 1986 are reported for a previously studied cohort of zzso chemical workers who were potentially exposed to zzso acid zzso and its derivatives between 1945 and zzso zzso mortality was compared with expected levels based on death rates of the US population and of zzso zzso workers from the same manufacturing zzso zzso zzso zzso was a particular focus of the study because of a suggested association with zzso exposure in some zzso zzso For the total observation period, the standardized mortality ratios for all causes and for zzso zzso were 92 and 91, zzso zzso using the internal comparison group yielded virtually identical zzso The initial study had found two deaths from zzso both of which occurred under circumstances zzso short zzso and modest zzso which made it less plausible that they were related to zzso zzso No new deaths from NHL were observed in the extended follow-up period and mortality for this cause showed a zzso significant excess zzso mortality ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso 24 to zzso for the total observation zzso zzso by production area, and by two different measures of exposure, combined with two different approaches to account for zzso did not show patterns suggestive of a zzso relationship between exposure to zzso or its derivatives and any particular cause of zzso
