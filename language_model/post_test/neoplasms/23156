This study evaluated the learning effectiveness of different teaching methods in the dimensions of knowledge, attitude, and learning zzso 

This study used a zzso study zzso Participants were cancer ward nurses working at one medical center in northern zzso Participants were divided into an experimental group and control zzso The experimental group took an zzso course and the control group took a standard classroom course using the same basic course zzso Researchers evaluated the learning efficacy of each group using a questionnaire based on the quality of cancer nursing care learning effectiveness zzso All participants answered the questionnaire once before and once after completing the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso scores for both groups were significantly higher than zzso scores for both zzso zzso zzso scores were significantly higher for the control group, while the experimental group reported no significant zzso zzso after a zzso analysis of the zzso scores for both groups, the zzso score for the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group in the knowledge zzso zzso scores did not differ significantly from zzso scores for either group in the attitude zzso zzso zzso satisfaction scores between the two groups did not differ significantly with regard to teaching zzso The zzso method, however, was demonstrated as more flexible than the classroom teaching zzso 

Study results demonstrate the importance of employing a variety of teaching methods to instruct clinical nursing zzso We suggest that both classroom teaching and zzso instruction methods be used to enhance the quality of cancer nursing care education zzso We also encourage that zzso between student and instructor be incorporated into zzso course designs to enhance zzso
