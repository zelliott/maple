zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aromatic zzso such as zzso zzso have the ability to bind to and activate the zzso zzso factor, the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso related compounds that bind to the zzso and exhibit biological actions similar to zzso are commonly referred to as zzso zzso zzso Ambient human exposure to zzso occurs through the zzso of foods containing zzso of zzso that zzso through the food zzso Due to their zzso and zzso once zzso they accumulate in zzso tissue resulting in chronic lifetime human zzso Since human exposure to zzso always occurs as a complex mixture, the zzso zzso Factor zzso methodology has been developed as a mathematical tool to assess the health risk posed by complex zzso of these zzso The zzso methodology is a relative potency scheme that ranks the zzso activity of a compound relative to zzso that is the most potent zzso This allows for the zzso of the potential zzso activity of a mixture of zzso based on a common mechanism of action involving an initial binding of zzso to the zzso The toxic zzso of zzso was nominated for zzso because of the widespread human exposure to zzso and the lack of data on the zzso of the zzso methodology for predicting relative potency for cancer zzso To address this, the National zzso Program conducted a series of zzso zzso in female Harlan zzso rats to evaluate the chronic toxicity and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced commercially before 1977 for the electric industry as a zzso insulating fluid for zzso and zzso zzso and use of the chemical was stopped because of increased zzso zzso in the environment, but it continues to be released into the environment through the use and disposal of products containing zzso as zzso during the manufacture of certain organic zzso and during combustion of some waste zzso zzso of zzso 126 results in persistent levels in animal and human zzso and the biological responses to zzso 126 are similar to those of zzso a known human zzso zzso 126 was selected for study by the National zzso Program as a part of the zzso zzso evaluation to assess the cancer risk posed by complex zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso evaluation includes conducting multiple zzso rat zzso to evaluate the relative chronic toxicity and zzso of zzso structurally related zzso and zzso of these zzso zzso 126 was included since this is the most potent zzso zzso that has zzso zzso While one of the aims of the zzso zzso evaluation was a comparative analysis across studies, in this Technical Report only the results of the zzso 126 study are presented and zzso Female Harlan zzso rats were administered zzso 126 zzso zzso in corn oil with zzso by zzso for 14, 31, or 53 weeks or 2 zzso zzso zzso Groups of 81 female rats were administered 30, 100, zzso zzso zzso or 1,000 zzso zzso zzso body weight in corn zzso zzso by zzso 5 days per week, for up to 104 zzso a group of 81 vehicle control female rats received the corn zzso vehicle zzso A group of 28 rats received 10 zzso for up to 53 weeks zzso Up to 10 rats per group were evaluated at 14, 31, or 53 zzso A zzso group of 50 female rats was administered 1,000 zzso zzso 126 in corn zzso zzso by zzso for 30 weeks then the vehicle for the remainder of the zzso Mean body weights of 30 and 100 zzso rats were similar to those of the vehicle controls during most of the study, mean body weights of 175 and 300 zzso rats were less than those of the vehicle controls during year 2 of the study, and mean body weights of 550 zzso 1,000 zzso core study, and 1,000 zzso zzso rats were less than those of the vehicle controls after week zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in serum zzso hormone levels were evaluated at the zzso zzso and zzso week interim zzso In the 550 and 1,000 zzso rats, total zzso zzso and free T4 were significantly lower than vehicle controls and serum zzso zzso and zzso stimulating hormone zzso levels were significantly higher than vehicle controls at the zzso interim zzso zzso zzso was also significantly higher in the 300 zzso rats compared to vehicle controls at 14 zzso At 31 weeks, zzso was significantly higher at doses of 100 zzso or greater compared to vehicle zzso zzso levels were higher in 550 and 1,000 zzso rats than in vehicle zzso At 53 weeks, significantly lower serum zzso of total T4 and free T4 were observed compared to vehicle controls in groups administered 175 zzso or greater and 30 zzso or greater, zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly higher at doses of 175 zzso or greater compared to vehicle zzso No changes in zzso were observed between vehicle controls and zzso rats at 53 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To evaluate zzso zzso analysis of labeling of replicating zzso with zzso was conducted at the zzso zzso and zzso interim zzso The zzso labeling index was significantly higher at doses of 300 zzso or greater at 14 weeks and 175 zzso or greater at 31 weeks compared to vehicle

zzso 126 zzso IN zzso The tissue disposition of zzso 126 was analyzed in the liver, zzso fat, and blood of all rats in vehicle controls and all zzso groups at the zzso zzso and zzso interim evaluations and in 10 rats per group including vehicle controls at the end of the zzso study (104 zzso zzso zzso of zzso 126 were observed in the liver, fat, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso 126 were
