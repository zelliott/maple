The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso are both present in significant amounts in the zzso of zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether these zzso zzso activities are altered in patients who have zzso 

zzso zzso zzso activities were measured in 108 cancer patients presenting with zzso at one of variable sites, prior to clinical zzso These were compared with an zzso and zzso control group of 31 healthy zzso 

Mean zzso zzso activities did not differ significantly, zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso However, mean zzso zzso activities of 204 zzso zzso in the zzso patients were significantly higher than the 158 zzso zzso in controls zzso value of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso levels may warrant further investigation as a potential peripheral marker in zzso
