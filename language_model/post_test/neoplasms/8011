zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso to a zzso zzso Its zzso nature exploits enhanced zzso and retention in zzso zzso This compound is stable and inactive in zzso solution and zzso predominantly zzso metabolism at the site where active zzso is zzso Because it does not require a zzso zzso vehicle, it can be administered by short infusion into peripheral zzso In zzso models, compared with the same dose of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso yields zzso zzso increase in area under the curve in both plasma and zzso zzso This zzso in drug zzso and zzso is attributable to the ability of zzso to concentrate in areas of vascular zzso such as zzso zzso zzso is taken up by both zzso cells and normal zzso cells and is transported to zzso where it is released by specific zzso through zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso models, at the zzso tolerated dose, zzso appears to be more active than the standard doses of zzso It has also demonstrated activity in zzso zzso zzso Its potential enhancement of efficacy and decrease in drug-related zzso make this agent an attractive option for therapeutic zzso In Phase I trials it has been relatively zzso with acceptable toxicity at doses zzso 225 zzso every 3 zzso In combination with zzso the maximum tolerated dose is 235 zzso and the recommended Phase II dose 210 zzso zzso has been demonstrated in both zzso cell lung zzso zzso and in zzso cancer, Phase III studies are currently testing this agent versus standard zzso as maintenance therapy for zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso at a dose of 210 zzso zzso status zzso 0 - 1) or 175 zzso zzso 2) is being compared with zzso (75 zzso for the zzso treatment of zzso In front-line zzso 2 zzso patients, this agent in combination with zzso is undergoing comparison with zzso in a separate effort, zzso zzso is being compared with either zzso or zzso These studies will determine whether the zzso and early clinical promise of this agent can be zzso in the clinical treatment of solid zzso
