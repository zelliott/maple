To determine whether in zzso zzso of clones from zzso of human tumors zzso biopsy specimens of two separate zzso zzso were obtained from 75 zzso zzso tumor growth zzso than 30 colonies per zzso occurred in both specimens in 49 of the 75 zzso zzso were performed simultaneously in 22 patients zzso and zzso in 27 patients zzso zzso samples were scored as being resistant (less than 50% zzso of colony zzso or sensitive zzso than 50% zzso to each zzso The two tumor samples from each patient were compared for differences in sensitivity after exposure with standard panels of zzso zzso A total of 272 individual drug comparisons were zzso Variations were evident in 49 zzso of 121 zzso drug comparisons and in 42 zzso of 151 zzso drug zzso We concluded that multiple zzso of human tumors can vary in zzso in zzso this finding seemed to reflect the zzso of zzso zzso
