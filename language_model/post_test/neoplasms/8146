zzso studies utilizing animals and in zzso cellular or tissue preparations have been used to study the toxic effects and mechanism of action of drugs and chemicals and to determine the effective and safe dose of drugs in humans and the risk of toxicity from chemical zzso Testing in animals could be improved if animal dosing using the zzso basis was abandoned and drugs and chemicals were administered to compare the effects of zzso and zzso equivalent serum levels in the animal model and zzso Because alert physicians or epidemiology studies, not animal studies, have discovered most human zzso and zzso in children, animal studies play a minor role in discovering zzso and agents that are deleterious to infants and zzso In zzso studies play even a less important role, although they are helpful in describing the cellular or tissue effects of the drugs or chemicals and their mechanism of zzso One cannot determine the magnitude of human risks from in zzso studies when they are the only source of zzso zzso 

zzso studies on adult animals is carried out by pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies, the Food and Drug Administration zzso many laboratories at the National Institutes of Health, and scientific investigators in laboratories throughout the zzso Although there is a vast amount of animal zzso studies carried out on pregnant animals and adult animals, there is a paucity of animal studies utilizing zzso infant, and juvenile zzso This zzso is compounded by the fact that there are very few zzso studies carried out in zzso That is one reason why pregnant women and children are referred to as zzso zzso 

When animal studies are carried out with newborn and developing animals, the results demonstrate that zzso are less zzso and less predictable than the zzso studies in pregnant zzso Although many studies show that infants and developing animals may have difficulty in zzso drugs and are more vulnerable to the toxic effects of environmental zzso there are exceptions that indicate that infants and developing animals may be less vulnerable and more resilient to some drugs and zzso In other words, the zzso indicating that developing animals are always more sensitive to environmental zzso is not zzso For animal zzso studies to be useful, animal studies have to zzso modern concepts of zzso and zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso studies to determine whether animal data can be zzso for determining human zzso One example is the inability to determine zzso risks in humans for some drugs and chemicals that produce tumors in zzso When the zzso is the result of zzso zzso a reaction that is of diminished importance in zzso 

Scientists can zzso animal studies to study the zzso and zzso aspects of drugs and environmental zzso But they have to be carried out with the most modern techniques and interpreted with the highest level of scholarship and zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso and toxic effects can be determined in animals, but have to be interpreted with caution when applying them to the zzso Adult problems in growth, zzso dysfunction, zzso zzso and zzso may be related to zzso to drugs, zzso and physical agents during development and may be fruitful areas for zzso zzso permissible zzso have to be based on data, not on zzso that are applied to all drugs and zzso zzso studies are still the best methodology for determining the human risk and the effects of environmental zzso zzso out these focused studies in developing humans will be zzso Animal studies may be our only alternative for answering many questions with regard to specific zzso zzso zzso
