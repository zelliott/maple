Pollution caused by the electromagnetic fields zzso of radio zzso zzso generated by the zzso system is one of the greatest environmental problems of the zzso zzso The purpose of this research was to verify the existence of a spatial correlation between base station zzso clusters and cases of deaths by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso state, Brazil, from 1996 to 2006 and to measure the human exposure levels to zzso where there is a major concentration of cellular telephone zzso zzso A descriptive spatial analysis of the zzso and the cases of death by zzso identified in the zzso was performed through an zzso approach, using zzso The database employed in the survey was composed of three data zzso zzso death by zzso documented by the Health Municipal zzso zzso zzso documented in zzso zzso Nacional de zzso zzso National zzso and zzso census and demographic city population data obtained from official archives provided by zzso zzso zzso de zzso e zzso zzso Institute of zzso and zzso The results show that approximately zzso zzso were installed through December zzso Most zzso of the zzso were located in the zzso zzso region of the zzso Between 1996 and 2006, zzso deaths by zzso occurred and within an area of 500 m from the zzso the mortality rate was zzso per 10,000 zzso Outside of this area, a decrease in the number of deaths by zzso zzso The greatest accumulated zzso was zzso per 1000 in the zzso region and the lowest zzso was zzso per 1000 in the zzso zzso During the environmental monitoring, the largest accumulated electric field measured was zzso zzso and the smallest was zzso zzso The largest density power was zzso zzso and the smallest was zzso zzso
