zzso binding zzso belonging to a family of zzso proteins zzso from bacteria to human, are involved in zzso and zzso regulation of various zzso zzso alternative zzso DNA replication and repair, as well as cell zzso A typical zzso binding protein contains three structure zzso namely the zzso domain, the zzso zzso domain and the zzso cold shock domain zzso which binds strongly to zzso zzso box found in different promoters and determines protein zzso binding proteins may play an important zzso role in cell zzso example, the human zzso protein 1 zzso may be zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, it may also act as a negative regulator of zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in a zzso manner using specifically reporter zzso This implies that zzso may, in some situations, protect cells from zzso zzso indicating that zzso may be a good target for the development of a new zzso function of zzso binding protein and its effect on zzso are summarized in the zzso We hope to further explore the functional roles of zzso binding zzso and provide some helpful lines and suggestions for tumor zzso
