The zzso zzso zzso recognizes a previously unknown nuclear protein that showed a restricted distribution in normal zzso and was also zzso in a subset of diffuse large zzso zzso Using this zzso we expression cloned zzso zzso its zzso target and identified this protein as a novel putative zzso factor, zzso The zzso protein sequence contains predicted zzso characteristic of zzso factors, including a winged zzso zzso zzso a second potential zzso zzso a zzso zinc finger, nuclear zzso signals, zzso regions, zzso zzso and potential zzso zzso The zzso gene has been mapped to zzso zzso a region that commonly shows loss of zzso in a wide range of tumors and which is reported to contain a tumor zzso zzso Using tissue zzso and zzso we demonstrate that both the zzso zzso and protein are widely expressed in normal zzso The levels of zzso zzso were compared in paired normal and tumor zzso (from the same zzso using a tissue array containing zzso extracted from 68 samples taken from zzso breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stomach, zzso small zzso and from nine cancer cell zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression between normal and tumor samples were observed in 51% of zzso Most striking was the comparative loss of expression in zzso of colon tumors and comparative zzso of zzso zzso in zzso of stomach zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso expression in normal zzso (not taken from cancer zzso indicated that loss of zzso expression may occur in some zzso normal zzso adjacent to zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein expression was performed on 128 solid tumors, including 16 zzso 9 breast, 12 zzso 20 zzso 21 stomach, 10 head and neck, 35 zzso and 5 pancreatic zzso Complete loss of zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso of the predominantly nuclear zzso protein were frequently observed in zzso zzso Our study identifies zzso as a new candidate tumor zzso gene localized to the zzso zzso zzso
