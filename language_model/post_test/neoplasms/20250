It is known that zzso designated on the basis of zzso animal test results are extremely diverse in character, both in terms of zzso and the mechanism of action, which leads to complexity in their assessment for cancer risk to zzso The zzso of zzso into two categories, zzso zzso and zzso varieties has been proposed to give a zzso foundation on which cancer risk assessment can be reasonably zzso The term zzso zzso indicates a chemical capable of producing cancer by directly altering the genetic material of target cells, while zzso zzso represents a chemical capable of producing cancer by some secondary mechanism not related to direct gene zzso This zzso has contributed to the exclusion of various zzso zzso from the group of chemicals with potential cancer risk to zzso However, the term, zzso zzso tends to give the mistaken impression that zzso shown to be negative for zzso in a series of test systems might be harmless to zzso It should be realized that clear-cut criteria for this zzso have not been established because of zzso in the available information concerning mechanisms of action of zzso zzso Future scientific advances leading to zzso of the zzso mechanisms of zzso are necessary for establishment of the unified, more realistic and zzso approach to cancer risk zzso form exposure to zzso
