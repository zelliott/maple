zzso zzso zzso is implicated in DNA repair and zzso zzso zzso zzso is an oral zzso selective zzso and zzso inhibitor that zzso synthetic zzso in zzso zzso models with loss of zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the safety, zzso maximum tolerated dose, zzso and zzso profiles, and preliminary zzso activity of zzso 

In a phase 1 zzso study, we enrolled patients with advanced solid zzso at one site in the UK and two sites in the zzso zzso patients were aged at least 18 years; had a life expectancy of at least 12 zzso had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less; had zzso zzso were not suitable to receive any established zzso had adequate organ zzso and had discontinued any previous zzso treatments at least 4 weeks zzso In part A, zzso of three to six patients, enriched for zzso and zzso zzso carriers, received zzso daily at ten escalating doses from 30 zzso to 400 zzso in a zzso cycle to establish the maximum tolerated zzso zzso expansion at the maximum tolerated dose was pursued in 15 patients to confirm zzso In part B, we further investigated the maximum tolerated dose in patients with sporadic zzso high-grade zzso zzso cancer and sporadic prostate zzso We obtained blood, circulating zzso cells, and optional paired zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects were assessed by common toxicity criteria and zzso responses ascribed by Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and archival zzso tissue in prostate patients were zzso for exploratory putative zzso zzso such as loss of zzso expression and zzso zzso This trial is registered with zzso zzso 

Between Sept 15, 2008, and Jan 14, 2011, we enrolled 100 zzso 60 in part A and 40 in part zzso 300 zzso was established as the maximum tolerated zzso zzso toxic effects reported in the first cycle were grade 3 fatigue (one patient given 30 zzso grade 3 zzso (one given 60 zzso and grade 4 zzso zzso given 400 zzso Common zzso toxic effects were zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso fatigue zzso zzso zzso (35 zzso anorexia zzso zzso zzso (24 zzso zzso zzso zzso and vomiting (20 zzso and were predominantly grade 1 or zzso zzso were dose zzso and the mean terminal elimination zzso was zzso h zzso zzso zzso analyses confirmed zzso zzso exceeded 50% at doses greater than 80 zzso and zzso activity was documented beyond doses of 60 zzso Eight zzso zzso zzso zzso of 20 zzso or zzso zzso carriers with zzso cancer had zzso partial responses, as did two zzso zzso of four zzso carriers with breast zzso zzso activity was also reported in sporadic high-grade zzso zzso cancer, zzso lung cancer, and prostate zzso We recorded no correlation between loss of zzso expression or zzso zzso and measures of zzso activity in patients with prostate zzso 

A recommended phase 2 dose of 300 zzso zzso is well zzso zzso should be further assessed in inherited and sporadic zzso with zzso zzso DNA repair defects and to target zzso zzso in zzso
