Although the cancer stem cell zzso hypothesis has become an attractive model to account for tumor zzso failure to define a cell of origin has created the need to explore alternative models for cancer initiation and zzso Recent studies have linked an embryonic stem cell zzso gene signature with poorly defined high-grade zzso Here, we review advances in the zzso field with an emphasis on how human zzso stem cells zzso can be used to define early zzso events, including potential zzso and zzso targets, as well as zzso and tumor zzso networks that might facilitate zzso zzso These studies allow for investigation of cancer initiation in a manner that cannot be achieved using primary tumors, where only retrospective evaluation of zzso development is zzso By comparing transformed zzso with their normal counterparts, we hope to develop novel zzso therapies that selectively target zzso
