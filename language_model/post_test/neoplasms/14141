zzso and zzso have multiple and often overlapping and complementary functions in cancer, both in terms of influencing tumor development and in modulating the response to chemotherapy and/or zzso However, while there is evidence that zzso induction may accelerate the development of zzso other studies suggest precisely the opposite, that zzso zzso is zzso for zzso Furthermore, even in those cases where zzso and zzso appear to occur in tandem, it is clear that the two responses are not zzso An additional attribute of zzso cells, both tumor cells and zzso is the zzso of factors that may influence the growth and/or survival of other cells through zzso zzso The nature of the zzso factors which mediate these bystander effects remain to be zzso determined, particularly since zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells appear to exhibit different zzso zzso zzso cells tend to zzso factors that promote zzso in zzso tumor cells while, conversely, different molecules discharged from zzso zzso can accelerate tumor growth and zzso An understanding of the relationship between zzso induction and the zzso zzso zzso in both tumor cells and zzso is likely to be relevant to current clinical efforts to exploit zzso zzso as a therapeutic strategy for enhancing the response of zzso to chemotherapy or zzso
