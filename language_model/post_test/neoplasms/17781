To assess the role of zzso in tumor diagnosis and to explore the potential of this technique to improve tumor registry quality, the authors investigated the role of zzso as a diagnostic tool in registry zzso 

Through the Italian Network of Cancer zzso zzso zzso the authors retrieved tumors diagnosed during the years zzso from several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Tuscan Cancer zzso The authors then analyzed the amount of zzso confirmation by zzso code, distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso The authors zzso only for the Tuscan Cancer zzso the amount of zzso confirmation by both zzso and zzso diagnosis and demonstrated the variation of zzso confirmation with stage of zzso 

The better zzso zzso for diagnosis was rarely zzso particularly among lung and zzso zzso when considered together with zzso analysis, zzso examination was often reported in cervical zzso and breast zzso The usefulness of zzso increases with tumor stage, particularly in sites where biopsy is performed with zzso 

zzso may be useful to improve zzso characterization in advanced stages or in sites zzso for zzso moreover, zzso is useful as an initial detector of pathology, prior to zzso A prospect of improvement in diagnostic zzso and the use of ancillary techniques, such as molecular biology, could help clinicians and could increase the accuracy of cancer zzso
