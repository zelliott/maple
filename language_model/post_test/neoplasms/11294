zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso tumor zzso occurs in most human tumors and results in the deregulation of several members of the zzso family of zzso zzso Among the zzso family, zzso has been implicated as a key regulator of cell proliferation and zzso gene amplification and zzso is detected in some human zzso To study the role of zzso in tumor development, we established a transgenic mouse model expressing zzso in a number of zzso zzso via a zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso leads to zzso zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso in transgenic zzso zzso with data from human zzso the zzso zzso is found to have a weak zzso activity on its own and to significantly enhance the response to a skin zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso transgenic mice is distinct from similar transgenic mice expressing zzso or zzso In particular, zzso has a unique zzso activity and lacks the tumor zzso property of zzso in this model zzso
