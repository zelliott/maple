It is assumed that zzso damage caused by zzso oxygen species zzso from activated zzso zzso may contribute to pathology of zzso zzso are crucial in zzso tumor cell zzso The present study is focused on the zzso burst and zzso activities of zzso when challenged with Walker zzso zzso Survival and tumor growth dynamics were monitored in zzso while tumor cell proliferation when mixed with zzso was studied in zzso together with the zzso of zzso respiratory burst products, primarily zzso zzso were collected upon zzso zzso The survival of zzso injected animals was slightly improved, while their tumors grew less than in zzso The presence of tumor cells in zzso activated zzso to produce zzso oxygen similar to zzso zzso zzso from zzso animals diminished tumor cell proliferation in zzso zzso by zzso zzso while zzso from zzso and the zzso animals did not show such activity in zzso Our results confirm that in the case of rapidly growing tumors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso have zzso effects in the early phase of tumor zzso
