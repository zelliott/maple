zzso cycles contribute to zzso aberrations and generate large DNA zzso that facilitate zzso amplification in cancer zzso At the molecular level, large DNA zzso formation is initiated by zzso breaks, and zzso architecture such as short zzso repeat sequences zzso this process in zzso zzso However, the prevalence of DNA zzso in cancer cells is currently zzso To determine the prevalence of DNA zzso in human cancer cells, we have developed a new zzso approach called zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Nat zzso 2005; zzso zzso This approach is based on a relatively simple and efficient method to purify zzso zzso from large DNA zzso by zzso zzso followed by elimination of zzso DNA by zzso zzso zzso of zzso Analysis of zzso zzso profiles between cancer and normal cells using zzso can identify zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using a human zzso zzso we have shown that DNA zzso occur frequently in human cancer cell lines and primary zzso zzso overlap of the zzso containing DNA zzso between zzso and zzso cancer cell lines suggests regions in the zzso susceptible to zzso breaks and zzso zzso A subset of zzso containing zzso is associated with gene amplification in zzso indicating that the location of zzso in the cancer zzso serves as a structural platform that supports subsequent gene zzso
