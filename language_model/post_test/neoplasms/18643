zzso zzso was originally identified in human urine for its ability to zzso the transformation of zzso into its active form, zzso which degrades zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two major, functionally independent regions have been identified in the zzso zzso a zzso zzso region zzso zzso and a large zzso region zzso zzso spaced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to its specific surface zzso zzso zzso cell surface zzso zzso thus enhancing zzso zzso The zzso linked to the zzso zzso via a zzso anchor, mediates signaling through the assembly of a zzso complex with zzso zzso like the zzso zzso zzso zzso engagement with zzso results in a variety of cell responses, including increased zzso survival, migration and zzso These responses may be enhanced by the zzso binding of the zzso zzso zzso region to zzso zzso thus favoring zzso zzso zzso engaged with zzso exhibit a high affinity for zzso stimulating cell zzso The zzso system is regarded as one of the key systems driving zzso invasion and zzso Different strategies to prevent the activity of the zzso as well as the interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso have been zzso Many zzso studies are ongoing and, at least, two zzso compounds have reached Phase II clinical zzso The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive picture of the functionally relevant zzso together with a description of the promising compounds and strategies to control zzso activity and signaling in human zzso
