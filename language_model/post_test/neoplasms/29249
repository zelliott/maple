According to the hypothesis of zzso zzso external factors that disturb the function of the zzso system can raise the risk of zzso zzso and reduce life zzso Recent work has shown that the functionality of the zzso system is dependent not only on latitude of residence but also on the region's position in the time zzso The purpose of the present research was to examine the influence of latitude and time zone on cancer zzso cancer zzso and life expectancy at zzso A zzso multiple zzso analysis was carried out on residents of 59 regions of the European part of the Russian Federation zzso using zzso parameters zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso cancer mortality zzso and life expectancy at birth zzso zzso as dependent zzso The geographical coordinates zzso and position in the time zzso of the regions were used as independent zzso controlling for the level of economic development in the zzso The same analysis was carried out for zzso in 31 regions in zzso zzso was the strongest predictor of zzso in the zzso population; it explained zzso and zzso of the zzso in zzso of women and men, zzso zzso within the time zone accounted for an additional zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in women and men, zzso The highest values for zzso were observed in the southeast of the zzso In China, latitude was not a predictor of zzso whereas position in the time zone explained zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso in women and men, zzso The highest values of zzso were observed in the eastern regions of zzso Both latitude and position within the time zone were zzso for zzso and CM of the zzso zzso zzso was the best predictor of stomach zzso and zzso this predictor explained zzso and 50% of the zzso zzso zzso within the time zone was the best predictor of female breast zzso it explained zzso of the zzso In most cases, zzso and CM increased with increasing latitude of residence, from the eastern to the western border of the time zone, and with increasing level of economic development within the zzso The dependence of zzso zzso and zzso on the geographical coordinates of residence is in agreement with the hypothesis of zzso zzso
