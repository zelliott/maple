Various attempts have been made to zzso and improve the zzso of flow zzso determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso It is still not clear, however, whether the zzso of zzso cells in a stem cell graft should be done before or after zzso To address this issue, we investigated 78 zzso and 32 zzso selected zzso and zzso zzso products zzso before and after zzso using pilot zzso Cell numbers were zzso within a zzso chamber, and zzso content was determined by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to exclude dead cells from zzso Before zzso the mean viable zzso cell content in the zzso samples was zzso and increased after zzso to a mean of zzso of viable zzso Taking into account cell loss and cell death, the overall recovery of viable cells was zzso all zzso cells could be zzso Mean purity in the zzso cell fraction was zzso zzso before and zzso zzso after zzso The number of viable cells was zzso before and zzso after freezing with a zzso recovery of total zzso This leads to a mean zzso zzso zzso zzso recovery of viable cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso recovery of viable zzso zzso There was no significant difference in tolerance to zzso stress between cells from heavily zzso zzso patients and healthy zzso zzso Our data show that freezing significantly increases the percentage of zzso cells in zzso zzso probably due to the death of zzso and zzso cells zzso Nevertheless, the overall number of viable zzso cells in zzso as well as selected samples remains zzso Thus, zzso data from different laboratories, for example, within zzso trials, should be comparable independent of the different time points of zzso
