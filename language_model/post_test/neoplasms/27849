zzso with zzso zzso prior to zzso harvest may result in improved quality of bone zzso harvested for zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso Such improvements may reduce the risk for graft failure and decrease time to zzso Patients undergoing zzso zzso received zzso human zzso zzso immediately prior to zzso zzso zzso was administered as daily subcutaneous injections for 5 days at 5 zzso body zzso zzso of bone zzso samples before and after zzso treatment showed an increased bone zzso zzso and a zzso increase in the number of zzso zzso per volume zzso The mean zzso zzso ratio increased from zzso to zzso The mean numbers of immature zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells increased significantly from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso Other zzso zzso including zzso positive stem cells, were zzso The relative numbers of day 7 and 14 zzso zzso units zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso cultures revealed that the numbers of zzso culture initiating zzso were unchanged after zzso treatment in spite of the zzso increase in zzso To date, five of the patients have been transplanted with zzso zzso harvested after zzso zzso Time to zzso zzso was unchanged compared with historical zzso We conclude that zzso with zzso prior to zzso harvest may improve the graft by increasing the total number of zzso lineage restricted zzso cells, resulting in stable but not accelerated zzso zzso of zzso zzso
