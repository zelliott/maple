Previous reports have demonstrated zzso zzso factor zzso enhancement of zzso activated killer zzso cell zzso Based on these studies we have developed a model of zzso cell generation from peripheral blood stem cells zzso from cancer patients by in zzso incubation with zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso from seven patients were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C in zzso culture medium supplemented with zzso at increasing zzso zzso 100 or 1000 zzso in the presence or absence of 10 zzso zzso zzso activity generated in cultures with 10 zzso zzso + zzso was significantly higher than that generated by 10 zzso zzso and did not differ from zzso generation at optimal zzso of zzso zzso and 1000 zzso zzso from five additional patients were incubated with zzso zzso + zzso after sequential depletion of the zzso and zzso T cell zzso zzso activity was significantly reduced by depletion of both zzso and zzso T cells and almost completely abolished after depletion of both subsets, suggesting that T cells and not zzso cells are the main zzso precursors in this zzso Six patients have received two courses of zzso cells generated in zzso by zzso zzso + zzso on day zzso and zzso after zzso transplant in combination with zzso and zzso administration in zzso The mean zzso activity in peripheral blood of these patients dramatically increased immediately after transplant from a mean of zzso to zzso on day zzso and remained increased during the period zzso These results are encouraging and suggest that the administration of in zzso generated zzso cells early after transplant may have a role in the control of minimal residual zzso
