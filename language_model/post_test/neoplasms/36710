zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso in tumor cells have been correlated with resistance to several classes of zzso zzso In this study, the first comprehensive analysis of zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso tumors were zzso with an zzso directed against a zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso revealed that zzso was expressed in 22 of 44 lung zzso and 16 of 22 zzso surface zzso zzso although normal pulmonary and zzso zzso are zzso The tumor samples were obtained from patients before the start of zzso therefore, zzso was not induced by radiation or zzso There was no zzso expression in zzso Hodgkin's disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and most soft tissue zzso all of which are derived from zzso zzso zzso arising from some zzso zzso retained their zzso zzso These included zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of the prostate and zzso whereas both pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso of the breast showed a wide range of zzso zzso Further studies are zzso to determine whether expression of zzso plays a role in the inherent resistance of some tumors to zzso agents and other classes of zzso zzso
