We studied 232 dogs that underwent mastectomy for zzso zzso zzso The mastectomy specimens were evaluated according to structural parameters found to be zzso significant in human zzso zzso such as grade of zzso in zzso zzso of duct zzso extent of zzso disease, and nuclear differentiation in zzso zzso In this study, the zzso behavior of zzso zzso was assessed according to the frequency of development of de zzso or zzso invasive zzso within two zzso Our data indicate that we can recognize structural variables which permit zzso of zzso zzso into categories with distinct patterns of zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso and invasive zzso zzso we were able to identify zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that are considered precursor zzso in zzso Also, as in women, nuclear differentiation was found to be a zzso significant zzso zzso cellular zzso considered to be structural zzso of zzso immune responses in women, were noted in zzso of dogs with zzso or zzso zzso Application of the described parameters should facilitate comparative studies of canine and human zzso zzso and use of the dog as a model for the development of new therapeutic zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso
