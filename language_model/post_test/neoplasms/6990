The present study is aimed to compare survival and zzso changes over time between elderly zzso zzso and middle-aged cancer patients zzso zzso We considered seven cancer sites zzso zzso breast, zzso and corpus zzso zzso and zzso and all zzso combined (but excluding prostate and zzso skin zzso zzso relative survival was estimated for zzso of patients diagnosed in zzso in a pool of 51 European populations covered by cancer zzso Furthermore, we applied the zzso method to more recent zzso data from 32 cancer zzso to provide zzso and zzso relative survival estimates for the period of follow-up zzso A significant survival improvement was observed from 1988 to 1999 for all zzso combined and for every cancer site, except cervical zzso However, survival increased at a slower rate in the elderly, so that the gap between younger and older patients zzso particularly for prostate cancer in men and for all considered zzso except cervical cancer in zzso For breast and prostate zzso the increasing gap was likely attributable to a larger use of, respectively, zzso screening and zzso test in middle-aged with respect to the zzso In the period analysis of the most recent data, relative survival was much higher in middle-aged patients than in the zzso The differences were higher for breast and zzso zzso and for prostate zzso Most of this age gap was due to a very large difference in survival after the 1st year following the zzso zzso were much smaller for conditional zzso relative survival among patients who had already survived the first zzso The increase of survival in elderly men is encouraging but the lesser improvement in women and, in particular, the widening gap for breast cancer suggest that many barriers still delay access to care and that enhanced prevention and clinical management remain major zzso
