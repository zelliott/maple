During the past 20 years, several types of human zzso zzso have been identified that cause specific types of zzso The zzso of cancer of the zzso has been linked to several types of zzso with a high preponderance of zzso The role of these virus infections has been established 1) by the regular presence of zzso DNA in the respective tumor biopsy zzso 2) by the demonstration of viral zzso expression zzso and zzso in tumor material, 3) by the identification of transforming properties of these zzso 4) by the requirement for E6 and zzso expression for maintaining the zzso zzso of cervical zzso cell lines, 5) by the interaction of viral zzso with zzso zzso zzso and 6) by zzso studies pointing to these zzso infections as the major risk factor for cervical cancer zzso In addition to cancer of the zzso a major proportion of zzso zzso zzso and penile zzso appears to be linked to the same zzso zzso In addition, close to zzso of zzso zzso contain DNA from the same types of zzso Recent evidence also points to a possible role of other zzso infections in zzso cell zzso of the zzso This review covers recent developments in understanding molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso mainly discussing functions of viral zzso and the regulation of viral zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso most likely engaged in the control of zzso gene expression in zzso cells, emerge as important events in zzso zzso
