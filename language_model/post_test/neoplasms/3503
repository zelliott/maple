Data from two large, community-based clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of zzso zzso in anemic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy were zzso analyzed to determine if clinical outcomes were different depending on whether chemotherapy was zzso or zzso 

Patients received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Study 1; zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Study 2; zzso zzso zzso zzso three times each week for 4 zzso zzso end points were changes in zzso requirements, zzso zzso levels, and quality of life zzso A total of zzso out of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who both received chemotherapy and had available data, were eligible for this retrospective zzso 

zzso characteristics across groups were comparable with few exceptions, which were anticipated in view of the characteristics of the two different chemotherapy zzso zzso in zzso requirements after 2, 3, and 4 months were zzso regardless of chemotherapy zzso Mean increases in zzso level from baseline to final evaluation ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso across study groups and were zzso regardless of chemotherapy zzso zzso as measured by the Linear zzso zzso Assessment zzso improved significantly by zzso regardless of chemotherapy type, and improvements were associated with increases in zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated in both studies, regardless of chemotherapy zzso 

Treatment of anemic cancer patients with zzso zzso results in significant reduction in zzso requirements, increase in zzso levels, and improvements in zzso regardless of whether the chemotherapy is zzso or zzso
