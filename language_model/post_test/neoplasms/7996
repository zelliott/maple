The goal of this paper is to provide both the basic scientist and the zzso with an advanced zzso tool for performing in zzso experiments aiming at supporting the process of biological zzso of radiation zzso zzso understanding and description of zzso zzso dynamics is an additional intermediate zzso To this end an advanced three-dimensional zzso zzso simulation model of both the avascular development of zzso zzso zzso and their response to radiation therapy is zzso The model is based upon a number of fundamental biological principles such as the transition between the cell cycle zzso the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients and the cell survival probabilities following zzso zzso zzso describing zzso expansion and shrinkage are proposed and zzso The output of the zzso model is introduced into the zzso zzso package zzso which performs the zzso of both the external surface and the internal structure of the zzso evolving zzso based on volume or surface rendering zzso Both the zzso stability and the statistical zzso of the simulation model have been studied and evaluated for the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso structure and zzso growth rates have been shown to be in agreement with published experimental zzso Furthermore, the underlying structure of the zzso zzso as well as its response to zzso zzso agrees with laboratory zzso
