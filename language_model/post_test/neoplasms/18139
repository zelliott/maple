A great many cell types are necessary for the myriad capabilities of complex, zzso zzso One interesting aspect of this diversity of cell type is that many cells in zzso organisms are zzso This is called zzso and arises from cell cycles that are often characterized as zzso but in fact are widespread throughout zzso zzso is essential for normal development and physiology in many different zzso Here we review how both plants and animals use variations of the cell cycle, termed collectively as zzso resulting in zzso cells that support specific aspects of zzso In addition, we discuss briefly how zzso occurs in response to certain zzso zzso and how it may contribute to the development of zzso Finally, we describe the molecular mechanisms that support the onset and progression of zzso
