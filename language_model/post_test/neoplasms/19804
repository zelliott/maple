Next Generation zzso zzso has the potential of becoming an important tool in clinical diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making in zzso zzso to its enhanced sensitivity in DNA zzso zzso zzso of samples in comparison to current gold standard methods and the potential to sequence a large number of zzso genes at the one zzso We aim to test the diagnostic accuracy of current zzso technology in the analysis of zzso that represent current zzso and its reliability to generate zzso information on other key genes in human zzso Thirteen clinical samples (8 lung zzso 3 colon zzso and 2 zzso zzso already zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso by current zzso methods zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for detection of zzso in the same three genes using two zzso platforms and an additional 43 genes with one of these zzso The results were zzso using closed zzso proprietary zzso software as well as open third party zzso Our results indicate that the existing format of the zzso technology performed well in detecting the clinically relevant zzso stated above but may not be reliable for a broader zzso analysis of the wider zzso in its current zzso Our study represents a zzso lead validation of the major strengths and weaknesses of this technology before consideration for diagnostic zzso
