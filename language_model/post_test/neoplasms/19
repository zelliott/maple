zzso of zzso to various cultured cell types has a dramatic effect on cell zzso Both positive and negative effects on growth have been zzso Analysis of zzso with altered zzso dependent protein zzso suggests that zzso cells do not require a functional zzso zzso system for normal cell zzso Whether or not zzso stimulates or zzso cell growth depends on the cell type, the zzso driving its growth, the dose of zzso and the environment of the zzso The zzso gene product does not appear to be a component of the zzso zzso system, and no other zzso have been shown to use zzso as a second zzso However, another class of zzso possesses a zzso zzso activity analogous to that of zzso dependent protein zzso Several zzso products and growth factor receptors are zzso on zzso zzso suggesting that some zzso products, such as zzso may be targets for the action of zzso The role of zzso in zzso cell growth may be to zzso the activity of the zzso or their protein targets which control cell zzso
