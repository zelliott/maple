zzso a key cell cycle regulator, has been shown to be zzso in various types of zzso with little expression in normal zzso Such zzso genes potentially are useful targets for cancer zzso However, zzso zzso T cells are considered to be zzso zzso We identified at least one zzso zzso binding zzso zzso by a reverse zzso zzso Using a highly efficient zzso expansion system that is based on zzso B zzso cells as sole zzso cells we successfully generated zzso specific zzso from zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso specific zzso lines, which recognized zzso and zzso expressing target cells, were indeed generated by stimulation with zzso cells when zzso with low zzso of zzso whereas zzso cells zzso at zzso zzso could only induce zzso zzso which recognized zzso target cells zzso One zzso zzso line was zzso and zzso zzso whose zzso concentration required for zzso zzso were less than 1 zzso could lyse zzso expressing tumor zzso Taken together, zzso zzso is an attractive candidate for immune intervention in a significant number of cancer patients and zzso T cells can be readily generated using zzso cells as zzso zzso
