This study reported the zzso and characterization of a zzso zzso protein derived from the zzso of the Egyptian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family, and explored their zzso role in the cell zzso The protein zzso was performed through zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was characterized by zzso zzso acid sequencing, and mass spectrum zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested against different human cancer cell zzso The molecular cascade of cell death was explored through evaluation of zzso ratio, DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso potential zzso zzso c release, total zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle analysis by flow zzso Most of the separated zzso possessed variable zzso effect against different cancer zzso The most potent zzso fraction was zzso due to its ability to induce DNA damaging and fragmentation that was associated with a significant induction of zzso via zzso zzso and disturbed cell cycle zzso as well as an zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso initially by the impairment of zzso besides the DNA damage and in response to that the zzso zzso c that may in turn activated total zzso zzso and zzso in zzso leukemia zzso zzso The partial zzso acid sequencing of zzso revealed 100, zzso and zzso zzso with the Long zzso 1 from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso water zzso zzso
