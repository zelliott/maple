zzso structured zzso with diverse zzso such as magnetic zzso zzso environmental sensing and zzso are highly sought after for zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we designed and zzso a new kind of zzso zzso zzso as zzso targeted drug carriers, the controlled drug release progress and therapeutic effect were monitored zzso by the fluorescent state of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso with zzso were zzso using magnetic zzso zzso as core and the layered double hydroxide zzso as shell via a zzso route, the reaction parameters were well investigated to obtain the desired structure of the zzso zzso The zzso drug zzso was modified with zzso group zzso and loaded in the shell of zzso zzso via an zzso zzso To zzso the zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso folate was successfully immobilized onto the surface of zzso shell using zzso zzso These zzso behaved as zzso carriers for targeted delivery of zzso drug, zzso zzso within zzso cells and thus, these zzso exhibited clear zzso and zzso toward zzso cells as compared to normal zzso of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, after the zzso of these zzso there was a sharp contrast in zzso between the zzso zzso cells and the normal zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso shell quickly zzso into zzso zzso and then rapidly escaped from the zzso zzso of zzso shell by strong repulsive interaction, the released zzso rapidly lit up the whole tumor cells in a short time, but only very weak light was found in zzso zzso zzso
