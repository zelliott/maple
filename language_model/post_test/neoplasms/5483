zzso necrosis factors zzso and heat shock protein 70 zzso are determining factors in zzso mechanisms to tumor zzso The authors designed a zzso study to investigate the potential association of the zzso of zzso and of zzso and zzso genes with zzso zzso 

The authors used an zzso specific zzso chain reaction to characterize the variation of the zzso zzso region in 124 unrelated zzso patients with zzso tumors zzso lymphoma, breast zzso and other zzso and 106 healthy control zzso Using zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso genes was performed in patients with zzso lymphoma, in those with breast zzso and in control zzso 

Analysis of zzso zzso in patients with zzso tumors and in control subjects demonstrated a high relative frequency of the zzso zzso in the cancer zzso The relative risk zzso of zzso was especially high in association with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso genes in patients with zzso and in those with breast zzso revealed that these patients had highly significant differences in the zzso distribution of these zzso zzso compared with the control zzso zzso for one zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso and with breast zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso persons carrying the zzso zzso may have an increased risk of zzso In this study, zzso zzso and breast zzso were significantly associated with zzso in zzso zzso
