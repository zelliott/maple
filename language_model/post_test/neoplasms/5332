Advances in genetic engineering and expression systems have led to a rapid progress in the development of zzso fused to other zzso These zzso fusion zzso have novel properties and include zzso fused to the zzso zzso In the present review we describe strategies for construction of these zzso fusion proteins and discuss their in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins retain both zzso associated functions such as zzso zzso complement zzso and zzso gamma zzso binding as well as zzso associated functions such as the stimulation of proliferation of zzso zzso In zzso they produce strong zzso of the host immune response against any associated zzso In addition, these novel molecules are able to target tumor cells and produce a specific and effective T cell response capable of eliminating the zzso These properties suggest that zzso fusion proteins will be useful in the diagnosis and/or treatment of human cancer as well as in the zzso of human response against any associated zzso
