zzso zzso is a blistering disease with specific serum zzso zzso Although zzso studies allow accurate diagnosis, they are zzso expensive, and not readily zzso In contrast, indirect zzso zzso testing of serum on transitional rat zzso zzso is a simple and inexpensive method available to any zzso zzso 

Our purpose was to determine the specificity of positive zzso on rat zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

The zzso findings in four index cases of zzso zzso were compared with the findings in 47 patients with a variety of zzso zzso and no associated blistering disease as well as 49 patients with zzso or zzso disease but no zzso 

zzso was negative in all patients with zzso and no blistering disease and negative in all but one of the patients with zzso or zzso disease without zzso zzso zzso 

zzso on transitional rat zzso zzso appears to be a highly specific test for zzso zzso Because of its simplicity and zzso we suggest that zzso be performed on transitional zzso in any suspected case of zzso zzso
