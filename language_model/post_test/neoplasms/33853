Two distinct mechanisms, zzso and zzso implement the formation of the vascular network in the zzso zzso gives rise to the heart and the first primitive vascular zzso inside the zzso and in its surrounding zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso and expansion of this zzso While zzso refers to in zzso differentiation and growth of blood vessels from zzso derived zzso zzso comprises two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso The zzso process is based on zzso cell migration, proliferation and tube zzso zzso divides existing vessel zzso by formation and zzso of tissue folds and columns of zzso tissue into the vessel zzso The latter are termed zzso or zzso tissue structures zzso and tissue pillars or zzso zzso also includes the establishment of new vessels by in zzso loop formation in the wall of large zzso The molecular regulation of these distinct mechanisms is discussed in respect to the most important positive regulators, zzso and its receptors zzso zzso and zzso the zzso system and the zzso zzso The cellular mechanisms and the molecular regulation of zzso in the pathological state are summarized and the differences of zzso and pathological zzso zzso
