zzso form a family of zzso zzso proteins that promote zzso or zzso zzso and integrate the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso are believed to be involved in the differentiation of zzso during zzso They are involved in the relationship of tumor cells to the zzso and may on the other hand reflect the differentiation status of zzso In this study, we evaluated zzso the distribution of zzso zzso zzso 1 to alpha 6 chains of beta 1 zzso in a representative selection of normal zzso and 110 solid zzso In simple zzso zzso and zzso were usually zzso present in zzso cells, whereas in zzso and zzso zzso they were seen predominantly in the zzso zzso zzso was seen in the zzso aspect of zzso in a polar zzso In zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso showing either zzso distribution in cellular islands or generalized widespread distribution or rarely being zzso zzso and zzso were also seen in zzso components of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were widely distributed in benign and zzso zzso tumors and in the zzso zzso of zzso They were usually not seen in zzso except that zzso was present in zzso of the breast and zzso occasionally in poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso types had characteristic patterns of zzso zzso for example, smooth muscle and its benign tumors showed zzso 3, and 5, whereas zzso showed zzso 2, 3 and zzso zzso cells and zzso showed multiple zzso zzso 2, 3, 5, and 6 in a similar zzso In zzso zzso and zzso moderate to extensive reduction of expression of zzso 3, and 6 and of zzso and 5, respectively, zzso The results show that zzso zzso 1) zzso show characteristic cell zzso distribution patterns in solid tumors and are a potentially useful tool in tumor zzso
