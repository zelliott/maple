zzso zzso with zzso zzso architecture were prepared by coating zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mixture of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso block zzso zzso zzso zzso The model zzso agent zzso zzso containing an zzso group and a zzso zzso was loaded into the zzso at pH zzso by zzso bonding and zzso zzso The release rate of the loaded drug molecules was slow at pH zzso zzso mimicking the blood zzso but increased significantly at zzso pH zzso mimicking zzso zzso zzso drug release resulted from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which broke the zzso bond between the carrier and zzso Cellular zzso by folate zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso Thus, folate zzso significantly increased zzso zzso These findings show the potential viability of a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso
