Heat shock proteins such as zzso have the ability to zzso peptides and activate zzso zzso In this study, we tested whether zzso zzso of zzso or zzso forms of zzso in tumor cells would stimulate an zzso immune zzso Studies were carried out in zzso mice bearing aggressively growing zzso tumors derived from zzso zzso cells, a cell line that expresses zzso E6 and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso can induce protective and therapeutic zzso immune zzso Our data also indicate that the zzso effect of zzso expression seems to be limited by the induction of zzso regulatory T cells zzso zzso tumor transplantation increased the number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment of mice with zzso zzso decreased the number of zzso and enhanced the zzso effect of zzso zzso We also tested whether an zzso zzso zzso that is able to induce tumor cell zzso and, zzso release cryptic tumor zzso in zzso form, could stimulate zzso immune zzso Although tumor cells infected ex zzso with zzso had no zzso effect when used as a vaccine alone, the additional treatment with zzso zzso resulted in the elimination of zzso zzso This study gives a rationale for testing approaches that suppress zzso in combination with zzso or zzso zzso
