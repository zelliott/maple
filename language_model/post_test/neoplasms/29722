A simple procedure for long-term storage of cells for flow zzso DNA analysis was developed and zzso The cells were stored as single cells or zzso zzso suspended in a zzso buffer with zzso zzso or as small blocks of tissue from solid zzso The cells were stored for up to one year by freezing at zzso degrees zzso zzso analysis of the results showed no change in the zzso of cells in the cell cycle zzso as determined by zzso of the zzso It was found that in addition to the intrinsic sample variation from the zzso zzso by zzso there was significant zzso and zzso zzso Hence the most accurate results are obtained if different zzso of a sample are measured on different days rather than on the same zzso Use of the storage method thus has the potential of increasing the accuracy of the zzso The storage method makes sample collection independent of immediate subsequent zzso This has enabled us to perform large internally controlled experiments, involving more samples than can be analyzed in one day, to examine tumor samples from different hospitals and to zzso fully the capacity of our flow zzso The method was a prerequisite for developing an accurate zzso procedure for DNA content zzso
