Cancer zzso uses high doses of zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso because only a small fraction of the absorbed dose leads to lethal zzso breaks in zzso These breaks are more efficiently produced by zzso electrons zzso zzso zzso generated in proximity to the zzso The energy of these electrons (on average 21 electrons for the zzso of zzso is dissipated within zzso zzso of the zzso event and produces multiple zzso DNA zzso A single zzso event can be lethal to a cell and is comparable to more than zzso zzso zzso events in conventional zzso We now report that zzso administered to zzso cells in zzso and in zzso and zzso with resonant zzso gamma rays zzso zzso causes zzso of the zzso cells, presumably by zzso zzso with extremely small radiation zzso zzso zzso As a basis for comparison, about 5 zzso is necessary to achieve a similar effect with conventional zzso
