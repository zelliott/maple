Many studies found better cancer survival in patients with a high socioeconomic status zzso than in patients with a low zzso zzso at the time of diagnosis may be more frequent in patients of lower zzso and zzso influences their zzso The authors studied the association between zzso and serious zzso at the time of diagnosis among newly diagnosed cancer patients in The zzso 

Included in the analyses were patients registered in 1993 in the zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso with one of the most common zzso breast zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso and stomach zzso zzso zzso Information regarding zzso came from medical zzso The zzso of the patients was derived from their postal code of residence and zzso into three zzso The risk of being diagnosed with at least one other chronic condition was calculated using zzso zzso zzso 

The risk of being diagnosed with at least one other chronic condition was higher among patients with a low or intermediate zzso than among those with a high zzso for the five sites combined as well as for zzso of the breast or zzso The zzso was less clear for patients with zzso zzso whereas no socioeconomic variation in zzso was found for patients with zzso of the prostate or zzso 

zzso variation in the prevalence of serious zzso at the time of diagnosis does exist in some cancer sites, which may explain zzso the socioeconomic zzso in survival observed in patients with tumors in these zzso
