zzso is a zzso zzso zzso found in the essential oils of many zzso In cancer biology, zzso of zzso Ras zzso allows the proteins to dock to the membrane and be zzso zzso zzso is a target for drug development to inhibit zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity against tumor cells in zzso and in zzso zzso that novel treatment strategies may be devised independent of Ras zzso zzso frequently develop resistance towards standard zzso and thus novel agents are urgently required that bypass the zzso evoked by established zzso zzso We investigated whether classical mechanisms of drug resistance such as zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso zzso the tumor zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso play a role in the response of tumor cells to zzso zzso none of these genes zzso resistance to zzso indicating that this compound may be useful for the treatment of otherwise drug-resistant and zzso tumors expressing these mechanisms of zzso Furthermore, we applied a zzso approach to explore molecular zzso of sensitivity and resistance to zzso Among the candidates were genes involved in zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso and diverse other functional groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The fact that these genes are not associated with resistance to traditional zzso drugs suggests zzso may possess a novel mechanism of action, and consequently might bypass drug resistance to established zzso
