The zzso inactive zzso of zzso zzso are known as zzso zzso related proteins zzso The zzso occur independently or as zzso of other proteins in animals (both zzso and zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is due to the lack of zzso zzso required for the coordination of the zinc zzso The zzso analysis shows that these proteins are highly zzso across the zzso The three zzso in zzso are known as zzso VIII, X and zzso zzso zzso to zzso VIII are found in zzso zzso whereas zzso only possess zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are found only in zzso and zzso Most of these zzso are predominantly expressed in central nervous zzso Among the three zzso CA zzso zzso VIII is functionally associated with motor coordination in human, mouse and zzso and certain types of zzso in zzso zzso expression studies show that zzso X is exclusively expressed in the zzso zzso zzso is only found in zzso and is highly expressed in the central nervous system zzso of humans and mice and is also associated with several zzso zzso VIII, zzso and zzso have been shown to coordinate the function of other proteins by zzso interaction, and viral zzso participate in attachment to host cells, but the precise biological function of zzso X and zzso is still zzso The findings so far suggest many novel functions for the zzso zzso most likely related to binding to other zzso
