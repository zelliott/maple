zzso protein 1 zzso is zzso in many forms of cancer types but its role in prostate cancer zzso progression and zzso has not been zzso In this study, we addressed the functional and biological role of zzso in zzso 

Gene expression profiling was used to determine zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso on tissue zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso in zzso We used zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells to establish zzso zzso zzso Western zzso invasion, and zzso cell migration zzso were used to characterize the cells in zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso was evaluated in mouse zzso 

We identified zzso as a component of bone zzso signature in zzso which suggested a possible role for zzso in zzso progression and zzso zzso was expressed at higher levels in zzso cell lines than in normal prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed the invasion and zzso activity of the cells in zzso and delayed tumor formation and development in mouse zzso zzso that express zzso had higher zzso zzso zzso higher levels of zzso and were more zzso Analysis of the human zzso showed positive correlation between zzso nuclear zzso intensity and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso functions create zzso environment for zzso tumor growth and likely support zzso Taken together with its zzso values, zzso can be zzso both as a zzso marker and a therapy target in zzso
