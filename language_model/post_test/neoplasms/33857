A zzso model was recently designed to simulate cellular changes in the T cell immune zzso The model was validated by simulating cell changes in viral infections which target the same zzso T cell, yet cause either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso case material for comparison was available from human infections with human zzso zzso human zzso virus zzso or human T cell leukemia virus zzso Starting with cell values for a healthy human individual, zzso changes that influence the individual course of the various infections were determined by an zzso search zzso Such zzso differences determining a clinical course with zzso zzso or zzso are outlined and further discussed in this zzso
