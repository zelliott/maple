A GENERAL zzso OF zzso IS zzso zzso OF THE zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that all cells possess multiple structural genes zzso capable of coding for transforming factors which can release the cell from its normal constraints on zzso zzso In adult cells they are suppressed by zzso pairs of regulatory genes and some of the transforming genes are tissue zzso zzso The zzso zzso are temporarily activated at some stage of zzso and possibly during some stage of the cell cycle in adult zzso zzso zzso tumors, or tumors induced by chemicals or radiation, arise as the result of a double zzso of any set of regulatory genes releasing the suppression of the corresponding zzso genes and leading to transformation of the zzso zzso zzso dominant zzso tumors, such as zzso are the result of zzso inheritance of one inactive regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso of the other regulatory gene leads to tumor zzso zzso The Philadelphia zzso produces zzso of one regulatory gene by position zzso A zzso zzso of the other leads to chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses evolved by the extraction of host zzso genes with their conversion to viral transforming zzso As a result, in addition to the above mechanisms, tumors may also be produced by the zzso of these genes into susceptible host zzso
