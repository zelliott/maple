This study evaluated the overall burden of illness of zzso zzso and vomiting zzso and associated zzso costs from a hospital's perspective zzso to the zzso in patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy zzso in the US hospital zzso zzso 

Patients with a cancer diagnosis aged zzso years initiating CT in a hospital zzso setting for the first time between April 1 2007 and March 31 2009 were extracted from the Premier zzso zzso Patients were followed through eight CT cycles or 6 months zzso date, whichever occurred zzso Within each CT cycle, the follow-up time for zzso event zzso was from day 1 (except rescue medication use that was identified from day 2) to cycle zzso A zzso zzso model was developed to predict the zzso event rate per CT cycle in the study follow-up zzso Associated total zzso costs of managing zzso from a hospital's perspective were analyzed zzso Event rate and associated costs were estimated in the entire hospital setting zzso zzso and emergency zzso zzso costs included zzso hospital zzso and zzso visit costs zzso through a primary or secondary diagnosis code for zzso zzso and/or volume zzso and pharmacy cost zzso medications for zzso zzso All physician costs and non zzso treatment zzso costs were excluded from the zzso 

Among zzso study patients, zzso patients zzso received prophylaxis for all cycles in the follow-up zzso The overall base population had an average age of zzso years, was zzso female, and zzso zzso The distribution of zzso for cycle 1 CT cycle was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the follow-up period, a total of zzso zzso events with an associated total zzso treatment cost of $89 million were zzso Average daily treatment cost for all care settings was zzso The zzso model predicted a zzso zzso event rate per CT cycle in the follow-up zzso Study limitations include potential lack of zzso absence of data on certain zzso including alcohol consumption and prior history of motion zzso lack of a control analysis group to estimate incremental use of resource zzso and associated costs, and a potential for cost zzso 

In the current study analysis, a zzso zzso event rate per CT cycle per patient was predicted with an associated zzso average daily total cost of approximately zzso Further studies on early and appropriate zzso prophylaxis on zzso rates and economic outcomes are zzso
