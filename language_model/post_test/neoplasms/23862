The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes for a nuclear protein which has been shown to act as a zzso zzso The cellular role of the zzso protein is the control of cell zzso particularly important in stressed zzso The zzso gene is frequently zzso in sporadic and familial human zzso Most transforming zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso of the gene and define zzso regions that have a certain degree of tissue zzso Moreover, most zzso are point zzso and the type and zzso of the zzso substitution may sometimes help in recognizing the zzso zzso This is the case for C to T transitions at zzso sites induced by zzso radiation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein can also occur through mechanisms other than genetic zzso such as binding to viral or cellular zzso Loss of zzso zzso function seems therefore to play a crucial role in cell transformation in human zzso either during zzso or later in tumor zzso
