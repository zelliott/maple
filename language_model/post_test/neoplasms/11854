We have used two highly sensitive zzso to zzso zzso a protein associated with human melanoma, in cultured cells and normal adult, zzso and zzso zzso To measure zzso at the surface of intact cells, zzso zzso fragments of a zzso zzso specific for zzso were used in a binding zzso To measure zzso in zzso membrane zzso we used a novel zzso zzso that uses two zzso zzso to two distinct zzso zzso of zzso These zzso revealed that although zzso is present in small amounts in normal adult zzso it is present in much larger amounts in most zzso in some other tumors (both benign and zzso and in certain fetal zzso We conclude that zzso zzso to zzso may prove to be of value for the diagnosis and therapy of zzso
