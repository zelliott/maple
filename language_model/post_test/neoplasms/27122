To assess the statistical relationship between tumor growth and copper zzso we performed a zzso of studies in which patients with zzso were characterized according to any of the copper status indexes zzso copper serum zzso serum zzso activity, zzso protein zzso Our zzso shows that in the majority of cases (more than zzso zzso tumor growth positively zzso with the copper status zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice with subcutaneous tumors of human origin, zzso mice with zzso melanoma and zzso mice with spontaneously developing zzso throughout the zzso tract were studied to zzso determine the relationship between tumor zzso liver copper zzso and copper status zzso We showed that the copper status indexes increased significantly during tumor zzso In the liver tissue of zzso mice, zzso gene zzso as well as the expression of genes related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso Moreover, the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso a form of zzso anchored to the plasma membrane by zzso zzso which is zzso for zzso was also zzso The zzso copper zzso zzso which is normally expressed in the liver only during embryonic copper zzso was also zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of human zzso colon zzso cell growth in nude mice and induced DNA fragmentation in tumor zzso In addition, the concentration of zzso c increased significantly in the zzso while decreasing in the zzso We discuss a possible zzso of developing tumors on copper metabolism in the zzso
