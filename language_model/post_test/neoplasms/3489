zzso zzso recognized by cellular zzso of the immune system are potential targets for zzso cancer zzso These zzso are classified as tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in normal zzso and various zzso zzso peptides derived from zzso in tumor cells, and zzso Clinical studies with peptides and proteins derived from these zzso have been initiated to study the efficacy of inducing specific zzso T zzso zzso responses in zzso However, most of the zzso zzso used in these vaccination trials are zzso and these peptides cannot be applied for tumors of zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of most tumor zzso is zzso among tumors from different patients and can even vary among zzso obtained from one zzso zzso selection of zzso loss zzso may prove to be an additional obstacle for the clinical zzso of most of the known zzso zzso Recently, a new tumor zzso zzso has been identified on the basis of spontaneous zzso responses in different cancer zzso zzso is expressed in most human zzso but not in normal, differentiated zzso zzso zzso or loss of zzso would severely inflict the growth potential of the tumor zzso Since zzso is expressed by a variety of different tumors zzso zzso zzso may serve as important and widely zzso targets for zzso zzso zzso
