In an effort to improve affinity zzso validation in fixed patient tissue zzso we have developed a novel quantum zzso zzso system that zzso chicken zzso zzso for high sensitivity and specificity relative zzso of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated against human zzso and zzso and zzso validated for specificity by western zzso and zzso on tumor and normal cells and for relative affinity by layered zzso array zzso zzso bound desired targets in cell lines and fixed zzso and showed greater affinity than commercial zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso In tissue zzso experiments, zzso zzso with zzso zzso and quantum dot imaging correlated well with zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso suggested a trend toward correlation with prostate cancer zzso Grade and zzso Although patient numbers were small, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of relative zzso of cancer zzso with zzso and quantum dot zzso and show promise for rigorous clinical validation in large patient zzso
