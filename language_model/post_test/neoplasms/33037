The plasticity of the immune system is evident in the reorganization of secondary zzso zzso during immune responses, zzso tissue zzso occurring during chronic inflammation or graft zzso and the engineered zzso tissue formation induced by zzso expression of single zzso zzso zzso zzso seeking to harness this plasticity for zzso are under investigation, particularly by controlling immune cell recruitment and zzso tissue formation at tumor zzso By combining strategies from zzso tissue induction models with methods from tissue engineering, new approaches for studying zzso tissue development and zzso may be zzso
