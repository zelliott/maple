In zzso cells, control mechanisms have developed that restrain zzso transitions in response to zzso These regulatory pathways are termed zzso zzso The zzso checkpoint prevents cells from entering zzso when DNA is damaged in order to afford these cells an opportunity to repair the damaged DNA before zzso genetic defects to the daughter zzso If the damage is zzso checkpoint signaling might activate pathways that lead to zzso Since zzso of zzso control is a hallmark of zzso zzso regulators represent potential targets for zzso The zzso has recently come into focus as a critical cellular zzso that zzso zzso checkpoint control and repairs signals in response to DNA zzso A growing number of zzso checkpoint regulators have been found in the zzso suggesting that zzso has an important role in zzso checkpoint zzso In this review, we discuss zzso regulators of the zzso checkpoint, the zzso of this checkpoint in cancer, and potential candidate targets for cancer zzso
