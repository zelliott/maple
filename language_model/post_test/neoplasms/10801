Using swelling zzso we study the evolution of a thin circular artificial tumor whose growth is confined at the zzso When the volume of the outer zzso ring increases, the tumor loses its initial symmetry and zzso towards an zzso zzso Depending on the geometrical and elastic zzso we observe either a smooth zzso zzso of the swelling layer or the formation of sharp creases at the free zzso Our experimental results as well as previous observations from other studies are in very good agreement with a zzso zzso zzso
