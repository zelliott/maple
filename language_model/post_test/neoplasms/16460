The efficacy of cancer gene therapy depends critically on zzso zzso by which genetic modification of tumor cells results in killing of unmodified cells in the local zzso In zzso zzso therapy, expression of a zzso suicide gene is used to generate a zzso zzso that zzso to zzso zzso The objective of this study was to develop a zzso relevant tissue culture model for zzso bystander effects and to validate the model using as an example the zzso of zzso zzso zzso CB zzso by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso effects were measured in three-dimensional zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells by determining zzso survival zzso for both cell types using zzso zzso or zzso as parental cell zzso zzso killing by CB 1954 was much more efficient in zzso than zzso at equivalent zzso ratios, whereas the zzso analogue of CB 1954 showed even greater zzso For a series of zzso bystander killing in zzso showed a positive correlation with zzso zzso and also correlated with the bystander effect in mixed tumor zzso grown from the same zzso and zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso model identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso with superior therapeutic activity to CB 1954 that provided zzso activity against zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso This study demonstrates the utility of the zzso tissue culture model for zzso and zzso bystander effects in tumors and identifies a new lead zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso
