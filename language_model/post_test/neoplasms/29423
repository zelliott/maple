zzso degradation of proteins plays an essential role in various zzso processes including cell cycle zzso zzso and DNA replication and zzso zzso evidence supports a vital role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with the zzso recognition factor zzso zzso for the degradation of multiple cell zzso proteins to prevent zzso zzso In addition, it is critical for normal cell cycle progression by ensuring the timely destruction of various cell cycle proteins whose zzso expression zzso cell cycle zzso Here, we zzso our current knowledge about the various roles of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and how its activity contributes both to the preservation of zzso integrity and to normal cell cycle zzso and how its deregulation may contribute to human zzso
