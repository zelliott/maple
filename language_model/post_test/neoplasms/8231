The zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso in combination with various radioactive zzso has shown promise as a therapeutic gene in various tumor zzso zzso depends on adequate retention of the isotope in the zzso We hypothesized that in the absence of zzso zzso isotope zzso is a dynamic process either due to slow zzso or zzso of the isotope by cells expressing zzso zzso zzso is slower in zzso and zzso cells expressing zzso compared to a zzso cell zzso zzso retention half times varied zzso with the number of cells expressing zzso With sufficient zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso also supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso occurs and contributes to the retention of the isotope in tumor zzso zzso zzso was zzso In zzso studies in tumors composed of mixed cell populations confirmed these zzso
