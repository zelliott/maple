These analyses examine a) survival from the start of zzso replacement therapy zzso based on the total incident UK zzso population reported to the UK Renal zzso including the zzso who started on zzso and the zzso who received a pre-emptive transplant and b) survival of prevalent zzso Changes in survival between 1997 and 2009 are also zzso 

Survival of incident patients zzso zzso during zzso was calculated both from the start of zzso and from 90 days after starting zzso both with and without zzso at zzso Survival of prevalent dialysis patients was calculated to exclude patients once they were zzso Both zzso and Cox adjusted models were used to calculate zzso zzso of death were zzso for both zzso Relative risk of death was calculated compared with the general UK zzso 

The 2009 zzso 1 year after 90 day survival for patients starting zzso was zzso zzso in zzso In incident patients aged zzso the zzso 1 year survival had increased from zzso in 1997 to zzso in zzso In incident patients aged zzso 65, zzso 1 year survival had improved from zzso to zzso There were no survival differences between zzso The relative risk of death compared to the general population decreased from 25 times at age zzso to zzso times at age zzso zzso of death data zzso has improved zzso since last zzso zzso disease is the most common cause of death in prevalent dialysis patients and zzso most frequent in prevalent transplant zzso 

Survival of patients starting zzso has improved for all ages since zzso The frequency of cardiac disease as the cause of death has decreased since zzso
