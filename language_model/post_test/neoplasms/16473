zzso sponsored an international consortium for the evaluation of alternative models, including the zzso zzso for use in short-term zzso testing of zzso Products of the zzso evaluation included guidance for protocol design and zzso zzso spontaneous tumor zzso diagnostic criteria for common zzso zzso and results of zzso for pharmaceutical agents that are known human and/or zzso zzso and zzso Based on the zzso zzso recommended protocol elements for this model include: zzso study zzso groups zzso or zzso zzso a positive control group zzso or zzso a negative control group and 3 dose groups, the high dose set at zzso or zzso routine zzso evaluations, and complete zzso with microscopic evaluation of zzso zzso statistical analyses are trend tests or zzso zzso with no adjustments for zzso For an zzso to be zzso positive control groups must demonstrate an effect, and the zzso or zzso must be reached in both zzso zzso for a negative response include a valid zzso no statistical increase in common tumors, no biologically significant zzso increase in rare tumors, and no tumor zzso above that of historical zzso Positive responses can consist of statistically significant increases in the zzso of a common tumor or zzso increases in a rare zzso which may not be statistically zzso In either case, the zzso should be clearly above historical control zzso Evidence of a dose response or occurrence of zzso in a tissue with a zzso response can support interpreting an zzso as zzso The two most common spontaneous tumors zzso 1 zzso in zzso mice are zzso zzso zzso and subcutaneous zzso Use of implanted electronic zzso can increase the zzso of zzso Important rare spontaneous tumors zzso zzso or zzso zzso are zzso and pulmonary zzso Many other tumor types have been reported to occur sporadically in zzso zzso zzso challenges for this model include zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and recognizing the variable zzso of subcutaneous zzso In reported zzso zzso mice responded positively to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso indicating that unlike the zzso mouse zzso this short-term zzso is not overly zzso Positive responses often zzso an increase in tumors that occur zzso To successfully use this model, zzso must understand the biology of the zzso tumor zzso gene and the principles of protocol design and data interpretation for short-term zzso They must also know the historical response pattern of zzso mice to test agents and be able to accurately diagnose tumors in this zzso Use of the zzso mouse presents the pharmaceutical industry with several challenges, one of which is managing the uncertainty created by a lack of zzso for regulatory decisions about some possible outcomes for short-term zzso zzso
