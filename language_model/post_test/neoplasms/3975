zzso of zzso by zzso cells may provide useful information on the zzso characteristics of the cell, such as its drug resistance zzso We have prepared a series of zzso zzso complexes of the type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Me, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Me, zzso Me, zzso Me, zzso and investigated the zzso of zzso of these complexes in several zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso complexes were prepared by zzso reduction of zzso in a solution of zzso and zzso zzso followed by addition of the appropriate zzso The complexes were zzso by zzso zzso The complexes were incubated with the human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and with normal mixed zzso and zzso and the zzso and zzso of the various complexes were determined at various time zzso zzso was zzso high in some cell lines and lower in zzso In general, the more zzso complexes showed high zzso but the most zzso did not show the greatest zzso zzso was zzso Most of the bound activity was retained by the cells after removal of zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso is different to that of zzso The high and stable zzso of these complexes suggests that they may have application for in zzso zzso imaging and zzso and further studies are required to establish their mechanisms of zzso
