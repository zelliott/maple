Regulatory zzso receptors are zzso in numerous human zzso The specific zzso binding property of peptides can be exploited by their zzso with a zzso and their use as carriers to guide the zzso to the zzso expressing their specific zzso During the past decade, zzso zzso peptides have emerged as an important class of zzso for zzso diagnosis and zzso The first and most successful imaging agents to date are zzso zzso which are routinely used for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso with zzso and zzso in neuroendocrine zzso zzso results in symptomatic improvement, prolonged survival, and enhanced quality of zzso The results in terms of zzso zzso are very encouraging with few and mostly mild side effects when patients are carefully selected and kidney protective agents are zzso zzso much profit can be gained from improving the available zzso strategies and developing new zzso In this review, the current state of clinical use of zzso peptides for diagnosis and therapy of zzso is zzso In addition, potential directions for zzso and future developments are zzso These include the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso increasing the access and binding on specific receptors on the zzso sites, increasing zzso profile and zzso zzso Other peptides such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substance zzso zzso zzso zzso Y zzso and zzso peptides are promising for zzso and currently under zzso and clinical zzso
