A novel zzso zzso probe zzso was evaluated as an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging agent for monitoring zzso in zzso 

zzso of zzso in cell zzso and tumors was zzso zzso activities in cell zzso and tumor zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed on adjacent tumor sections to identify areas of zzso 

The in zzso cell zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso in tumor cells when treated with an zzso zzso The in zzso zzso imaging signal of zzso in zzso tumors correlated with the ex zzso zzso activities in these zzso Furthermore, tumor zzso of zzso in tumor sections matched adjacent sections stained by zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrated high affinity and selectivity for activated zzso both in zzso and in zzso and the results support zzso as a promising new PET imaging agent for zzso
