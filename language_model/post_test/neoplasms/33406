TRAIL is a death zzso that zzso zzso in zzso but not normal zzso Recently the ability of TRAIL to induce proliferation in zzso normal and zzso cells was zzso In this study, we analyzed TRAIL effects in zzso sensitive zzso zzso and zzso human tumor cell zzso TRAIL at low zzso zzso induced cell zzso At 100 zzso zzso death was readily observed, however surviving cells acquired higher zzso zzso zzso production of several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso 1 and 8 was essential for this zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso blocked zzso cell proliferation and further zzso zzso For the first time, we report that high TRAIL zzso induced cell zzso as determined by the altered zzso and expression of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 9 zzso protected zzso cells from zzso whereas zzso of zzso 1 and 8 increased the yield of zzso zzso In conclusion, in cultured human zzso cells, TRAIL therapy results in three functional zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses correlate with the strength of zzso zzso zzso production is responsible for its zzso and zzso zzso
