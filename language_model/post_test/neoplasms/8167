Maintaining the stability of the zzso is critical to normal cell growth and zzso The early notion that cancer is the result of zzso in genes controlling cellular growth implied that gene or zzso integrity is vital to the prevention of zzso and many genes and pathways that prevent zzso deterioration have been identified over the past zzso Recent progress in reverse genetic approaches, principally zzso zzso now allows the systematic analysis of gene function on a zzso scale in an animal zzso Here, we discuss zzso approaches in the model zzso zzso zzso aimed to identify genes and genetic networks that contribute to zzso stability and are thus potentially involved in human zzso
