Novel zzso possess highly selective, potent zzso properties in zzso and in zzso They induce and are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to putative active as well as inactive zzso zzso zzso of the zzso has been thwarted by zzso replacement of hydrogen with zzso atoms at positions around the zzso zzso The zzso of these compounds presents limitations for drug zzso and zzso To overcome this problem, water soluble zzso have been zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso primary zzso function of zzso The zzso retain selectivity with significant in zzso growth zzso potency against the same sensitive cell lines as their parent zzso but are inactive against cell lines inherently resistant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso rapidly and zzso zzso to their parent zzso in sensitive and insensitive cell lines in zzso zzso parent compounds are zzso and zzso by sensitive cells only; similarly, zzso activity and protein expression are selectively induced in sensitive zzso zzso zzso acid zzso meet the criteria of zzso zzso chemical stability and quantitative zzso to parent zzso and thus are suitable for in zzso zzso zzso
