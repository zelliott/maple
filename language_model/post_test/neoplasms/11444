Human zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso link protein synthesis to zzso zzso including zzso zzso of zzso stimulate zzso whereas those of zzso zzso inhibit zzso Thus, these two zzso acquired opposing activities during evolution, possibly as a coordinated mechanism for regulating zzso The recent identification of the cellular target of zzso sheds light into the mechanism of zzso zzso This mechanism provides a molecular basis for the lack of effect of zzso on the normal zzso With these features, we suggest that this zzso of a zzso zzso might safely be used to arrest zzso of zzso In particular, an zzso agent that stops the growth of tumor vessels without affecting normal vessels might serve as an adjunct to zzso zzso
