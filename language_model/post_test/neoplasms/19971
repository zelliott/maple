In cancer research, zzso profiling studies have been extensively conducted, searching for markers associated with zzso zzso to the zzso zzso small zzso zzso results generated from the analysis of a single zzso can be zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso analysis, which simultaneously analyses multiple zzso can be more effective than zzso analysis and classic zzso In most of existing zzso analysis, the zzso model has been zzso which zzso that different zzso share the same set of zzso Several approaches have been designed to reinforce this zzso In practice, different zzso may differ in terms of patient selection criteria, profiling techniques, and many other zzso Such differences may make the zzso model too zzso In this study, we assume the zzso model, under which different zzso are allowed to have different sets of zzso With multiple cancer prognosis zzso we adopt the accelerated failure time model to describe zzso This model may have the lowest zzso cost among popular zzso survival zzso For marker selection, we adopt a sparse group zzso zzso penalty zzso This approach has an intuitive zzso and can be zzso using an effective group coordinate descent zzso zzso study shows that it zzso the existing approaches under both the zzso and zzso zzso Data analysis further demonstrates the merit of zzso model and proposed zzso
