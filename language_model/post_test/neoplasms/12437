zzso human cancer risk based on zzso interaction is one task of zzso and it has provided indispensable knowledge for prevention of zzso The recent zzso of zzso mice has also provided solid evidence about the relationship between cancer development and zzso The aim of this review is to discuss the possible contribution of epidemiology to understanding the role of immunity in host defense against cancer, and also to assess the involvement of inflammation in the occurrence of selected zzso Here we look at the concepts of cancer zzso and zzso and include a brief introduction to recent studies in humans and experimental animal zzso It has been zzso for many years that the immune system has the ability to recognize and eliminate nascent transformed cells in the body zzso cancer zzso zzso and this idea has recently obtained strong support from animal zzso In humans, follow-up studies among zzso transplant recipients revealed a remarkably increased risk of not only selected zzso but also zzso with no known viral zzso On the other hand, a prospective cohort study among the general population revealed that individuals with low natural zzso activity of peripheral blood zzso had an increased risk of cancer zzso More studies are warranted to allow the construction of a model for the interaction between host zzso aging, and the zzso The host immune system is also involved in inflammatory responses to pathogen zzso insufficient immune function of the host, or repeated infection, may result in persistent zzso where zzso factors continuously act on initiated zzso The combined use of zzso will be necessary to define zzso persistent inflammation in future cohort zzso and, in addition to these zzso zzso cohort studies, one plausible future direction will be a zzso approach that can be undertaken within cohort studies, looking at the genetic background underlying individual variations in zzso zzso
