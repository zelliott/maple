An existing ultrasound system has been adapted for simultaneous use with external zzso beam zzso The system is being used to investigate the potential for increased biological benefit of simultaneously combined zzso and external beam zzso with currently achievable temperature zzso 

An existing clinical ultrasound system has been modified for simultaneous operation with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso system, computer, and zzso are located inside the treatment room, while the monitor and system control are located at the control zzso Two approaches have been used clinically to combine the two zzso In the first approach, an zzso setup is used in which the ultrasound beam and the zzso beam travel through the same window of entry to the zzso This is zzso by a reflecting system designed to deflect the ultrasound to the tumor while positioning the ultrasound zzso outside the radiation zzso The reflecting system consists of water and zzso materials except for a 1 zzso sheet of polished brass that is used as the zzso The relative pressure fields were measured in water at the same distance from the ultrasound source using a scanning zzso with and without the zzso at the two operating zzso of the device zzso and zzso zzso for two zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine the relationship between zzso zzso through the zzso and absorbed zzso In the second approach the ultrasound and the radiation beam travel into the tumor from different windows of entry such that the radiation beam passes through no portion of the water zzso prior to entering the zzso We have termed this approach the zzso zzso For both approaches, the radiation fraction is given in the middle of an uninterrupted zzso zzso zzso 

The system modifications did not impair the ability to effectively deliver ultrasound zzso or zzso zzso With the zzso approach the zzso patterns generated with and without the zzso demonstrated that the ultrasound system maintained both a uniform and zzso heating zzso The zzso beam had no effect on the performance of the zzso zzso The radiation beam is attenuated nearly zzso by the zzso zzso To date, 10 patients have been treated with the zzso approach and 12 have been treated with the zzso approach (90 zzso 

The clinical zzso of ultrasound zzso simultaneous with zzso zzso is technically and clinically feasible without any complications or hazards to the zzso The zzso of a reflecting device allows zzso delivery of both the ultrasound and zzso zzso Temperatures obtained during simultaneous treatments are comparable to those historically obtained during sequential treatments with the same commercial ultrasound zzso
