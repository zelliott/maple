zzso signaling along the zzso zzso zzso enables zzso conditioning of T cells and zzso zzso Although T cells can instruct zzso cells to manifest zzso properties after zzso engagement of zzso such a zzso signaling is not known to occur in response to zzso Here we show that mouse zzso cells were induced by soluble zzso to express zzso 6 and zzso zzso of zzso 6 required zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and prevented zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso In zzso an zzso activity of soluble zzso was demonstrated as enhanced T zzso immunity to tumor and self peptides and protection against microbial and tumor zzso Thus, different zzso of B7 can signal zzso cells to express functionally distinct zzso zzso
