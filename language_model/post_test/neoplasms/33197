The main remaining challenge for a gamma camera is to overcome the existing zzso between zzso spatial resolution and system zzso This problem, strongly limiting the performance of parallel hole zzso gamma cameras, can be overcome by applying new zzso designs such as rotating zzso zzso zzso which have a much higher zzso collection zzso The drawback of a zzso zzso gamma camera is that, even for obtaining zzso images, image reconstruction is needed, resulting in noise zzso However, nowadays zzso reconstruction techniques with accurate system modeling can provide better image zzso Because the impact of this modeling on image quality differs from one system to another, an objective assessment of the image quality obtained with a zzso zzso is needed in comparison to classical projection images obtained using a parallel hole zzso zzso In this paper, a comparative study of image quality, achieved with system zzso is zzso zzso data are reconstructed to zzso images using maximum likelihood expectation zzso zzso with an accurate zzso Carlo derived system zzso while zzso projections are zzso using a zzso Carlo derived zzso zzso zzso characteristics are used to show image quality for cold and hot spots of varying zzso zzso of the object size and contrast is investigated using the optimal zzso ratio zzso For a typical phantom setup, results show that cold spot imaging is slightly better for a zzso zzso For hot spot imaging, the zzso of the zzso images is found to increase with increasing zzso diameter and zzso contrast while it decreases when background dimensions become zzso Only for very large background dimensions in combination with low contrast zzso the use of a zzso zzso could be beneficial for hot spot zzso In all other cases, the zzso zzso scores zzso Finally, the simulation of a zzso bone scan on a zzso zzso revealed a hot spot contrast improvement up to zzso compared to a classical zzso bone zzso
