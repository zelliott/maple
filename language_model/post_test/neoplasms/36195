zzso zzso plants are widespread in the world and are probably the most common poisonous plants affecting zzso wildlife, and zzso zzso zzso are among the first chemical zzso identified in zzso Previously, we determined that metabolism of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso generated a common set of DNA zzso that are responsible for tumor zzso Using zzso analysis, we previously determined that four DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were formed in rats zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso Because of the lack of an adequate amount of authentic standards, the structures of zzso and zzso were not zzso and the structural assignment for zzso warranted further zzso In this study, we developed an improved synthetic methodology for these DNA zzso enabling their full structural zzso by mass zzso and zzso zzso We determined that zzso and zzso are a pair of zzso of zzso zzso while zzso is zzso an zzso of zzso With the structures of these DNA zzso unequivocally zzso we conclude that cellular DNA zzso binds zzso zzso for example, zzso at the zzso position of the zzso base, rather than at the zzso zzso We also determined that zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso are zzso This study represents the first report with detailed structural assignments of the DNA zzso that are responsible for zzso zzso tumor induction on the molecular zzso A mechanism of tumor initiation by zzso zzso is consequently fully zzso
