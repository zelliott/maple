The optimal protocol for the zzso of zzso remains zzso We present data on 42 patients zzso with zzso (3 or 4 zzso and the delayed addition of a standard 300 zzso dose of zzso zzso from day zzso The patients had received a median of 2 previous chemotherapy zzso 38% had received prior zzso and zzso had active disease at the time of zzso The protocol was well tolerated and 38 patients proceeded to zzso The median number of zzso cells zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The total number of zzso cells harvested correlated with the total number of zzso available for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred within median days to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso of 14 and 13 days, zzso Patients receiving more than zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had even more rapid zzso zzso with significant reductions in hospital stay and zzso zzso Those below this threshold had significantly delayed zzso zzso The zzso dose of zzso did not influence the achievement of the threshold zzso cell yield for optimal zzso The delayed addition of a standard 300 zzso zzso dose after zzso chemotherapy resulted in the use of a median 9 days hence 9 zzso of zzso This protocol presents the potential for cost saving without compromising the quality or success of zzso zzso
