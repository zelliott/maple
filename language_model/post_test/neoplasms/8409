There have been many attempts to develop zzso zzso models for zzso The models relate hypothesized biological processes occurring at the cellular level to the occurrence of tumors at the experimental or zzso level of individuals in a zzso The existing models fit a variety of data, but none is fully satisfactory and they are in some ways inconsistent with each zzso Recently, substantial new data have become available on the nature of zzso zzso observed directly at the cellular zzso These data suggest that the number of stages may be greater and more variable among individual tumors of the same organ than has been zzso There may be many pathways to cancer, and the zzso responsible may not constitute a fixed set or zzso This pattern resembles the zzso of quantitative rather than qualitative traits, and may also be consistent with the variable zzso and behavior of tumors of a given zzso zzso using such models suggest that cancer in the general population may have such zzso zzso a possibility that has important implications for zzso risk projection, and zzso zzso processes of a rather generic kind may generate similar hazard functions for diverse chronic diseases in the age ranges often used in zzso zzso This phenomenon raises questions about the purpose and interpretation of statistical zzso zzso
