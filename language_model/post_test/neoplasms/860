zzso of zzso zzso T cells is critical for vaccine zzso We have advanced a novel technology for enhancing zzso of zzso zzso T helper cells zzso a zzso of the zzso class zzso zzso chain zzso is linked to an zzso class II zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to create a zzso series of zzso zzso hybrids testing the influence of zzso length on in zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso hybrids or the zzso zzso zzso zzso As measured by zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso mice, one of the zzso zzso hybrids enhanced zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrated that enhanced zzso T cell zzso zzso the zzso activity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice using an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso hybrid has increased affinity to zzso cells relative to the zzso zzso which may explain its increased zzso In zzso zzso hybrid modification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso class II zzso generates a potent zzso zzso vaccine that may have potential for treating zzso zzso in zzso zzso
