The identification of several zzso proteins as binding partners of zzso an zzso signaling and scaffolding zzso has suggested the existence of molecular links between zzso functions and zzso traffic, as proposed by zzso zzso long zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso has recently been strongly implicated in tumor invasion as well as zzso zzso to its highly zzso expression in tumors and its direct involvement in invasive zzso Another zzso zzso was found to be a component of the zzso directional sensing machinery, while simultaneously playing an essential role in the zzso control of zzso production, which is zzso by zzso transport in zzso zzso These emerging molecular mechanisms may further delineate key processes regulating zzso traffic as principal controls of cell zzso and invasive zzso
