The distribution of zzso growth factor receptors zzso and receptors for steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied in zzso zzso and benign zzso tumors in zzso The distribution and mean levels of some receptors in normal zzso were statistically different from those in zzso and zzso The absence of zzso and the high levels of zzso zzso 20 zzso protein and zzso zzso 50 zzso protein were typical of zzso whereas zzso might be characterized by the high levels of zzso zzso 300 zzso zzso In zzso with and without zzso the following parameters were significantly different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 81 and 18 zzso respectively, and zzso zzso 160 and 58 zzso zzso zzso The most zzso parameters for distinguishing zzso and zzso appeared to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The most sensitive zzso for zzso was zzso which, however, is least zzso zzso is most specific zzso The optimal amount of three zzso zzso + zzso + zzso zzso is most exact for differential zzso
