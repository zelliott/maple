Experimental data suggest that zzso copper, and zzso are involved in zzso and zzso Few zzso studies have related these minerals to cancer or cardiovascular disease mortality in a zzso 

Data from the Paris Prospective Study 2, a cohort of zzso men age zzso years at zzso were used to assess the association between serum zzso copper, and zzso and zzso cancer, and cardiovascular disease zzso zzso mineral values measured at baseline were divided into zzso and classified into low zzso zzso zzso group), medium zzso zzso and high (4th zzso zzso During 18-year follow up, 339 deaths occurred, 176 as a result of cancer and 56 of cardiovascular zzso Relative risks zzso for each element were zzso using Cox's zzso hazard model after controlling for various potential zzso 

High copper values (4th zzso were associated with a 50% increase in zzso for zzso deaths zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso a zzso increase for cancer mortality zzso zzso and a zzso increase for cardiovascular mortality zzso zzso compared with low values zzso zzso High zzso values were zzso related to mortality with a zzso decrease in zzso for zzso zzso zzso and cardiovascular deaths zzso zzso and by 50% for cancer deaths zzso zzso Additionally, subjects with a combination of low zinc and high copper values had zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and cancer zzso zzso mortality zzso Similarly, combined low zinc and high zzso values were associated with decreased zzso zzso zzso and cancer zzso zzso mortality zzso 

High serum copper, low serum zzso and zzso of low serum zinc with high serum copper or low serum zzso contribute to an increased mortality risk in middle-aged zzso
