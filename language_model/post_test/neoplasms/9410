The last zzso years of research into zzso function has revealed some fascinating discoveries into the orchestration of tumor zzso pathways with a multitude of putative drug targets being zzso However, it was not until 1998 that the ancestral mother of zzso was zzso The eldest evolutionary zzso zzso of the zzso family is known today as zzso zzso it was thought zzso was another tumor zzso that could function in a similar capacity to zzso However, elegant demonstrations of the divergent roles that zzso plays as a key zzso regulator of the proliferation and differentiation cascade in zzso zzso are zzso These data link zzso to adult tissue stem cell regulation and possibly zzso stem zzso zzso lacks zzso in cancer development, which is in stark contrast to the classically high zzso status of zzso in a large compendium of cancer zzso Perhaps suggesting a selective preference for zzso zzso Why is zzso rarely zzso despite being part of the same gene zzso Interestingly, zzso is often zzso and amplified in cancer, thus revealing a zzso Is zzso required to provide cancer cell populations with a selective advantage as much as a loss of zzso function by zzso Has zzso been masking a zzso with promising features as a target for drug development? Can we exploit the zzso know how gained from the mass of zzso research to further zzso zzso gene zzso In this review, we will zzso the emerging advances that are zzso zzso as a promising drug zzso
