The study of the zzso and zzso of platinum based zzso drugs has done much to direct their development, at both zzso and clinical zzso The clinical development of zzso depended on an understanding of its mechanism of zzso The zzso of the zzso toxicity of zzso with sodium zzso infusion and forced zzso is thought to rely on a common zzso effect to suppress the formation of zzso species in the zzso zzso Studies of the zzso of zzso toxicity with other agents have followed, although none has yet achieved widespread zzso Following the demonstration of the important clinical role for zzso studies of the relationship between toxicity and the zzso of the leaving groups led to the development of the less toxic but equally effective zzso zzso The clinical development of zzso has in turn been strongly influenced by the studies of its zzso with zzso guided dosing now being standard in many cancer zzso and also being widely used in current clinical zzso zzso studies in animals have demonstrated that it is possible to make zzso that have good oral zzso Apart from the convenience of oral administration, there is also the suggestion that these molecules may possess activity against certain zzso resistant cell zzso For the future, the development of sensitive zzso zzso the exact types of zzso zzso formed can be characterized may allow the reason for the remarkable zzso activity of these complexes to be zzso and further, more selective compounds to be zzso The history of the development of platinum compounds emphasizes the importance of performing intensive zzso zzso and zzso studies in concert with the clinical development of any class of zzso
