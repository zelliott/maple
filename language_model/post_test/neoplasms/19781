zzso cancer risk from environmental zzso containing zzso aromatic zzso zzso is zzso zzso each mixture would undergo toxicity testing to derive a cancer slope factor zzso for use in zzso cancer risk zzso However, this whole mixture approach is extremely costly in terms of finances, time, and animal zzso zzso if an untested mixture is zzso zzso to a zzso mixture with a zzso the zzso zzso can be used in risk zzso We propose that similarity between 2 zzso could be established using an in zzso battery of zzso and zzso zzso An observed association between zzso and zzso of zzso suggests that the addition of immune suppression zzso may improve this zzso First, using published studies of zzso zzso and other zzso we demonstrated a correlation between the derived immune suppression relative potency factors zzso for 9 zzso and their respective cancer zzso confirming observations published zzso Second, we constructed an integrated knowledge map for immune suppression by zzso based on the available zzso zzso The map illustrates the zzso complexities involved in zzso zzso suggesting that multiple in zzso tests of immune suppression involving different zzso cell types, and zzso will have greater zzso value for immune suppression in zzso than a single zzso Based on these zzso research strategies are recommended to validate a battery of in zzso immune suppression tests that, along with tests for zzso and other zzso modes of cancer action, could be used to establish zzso zzso of 2 zzso for zzso cancer risk zzso
