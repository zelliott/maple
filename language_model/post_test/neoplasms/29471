During cell division, interaction between zzso and dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key regulator of zzso zzso assembly and zzso However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying its zzso activity during the cell cycle remain zzso Here, we showed that zzso is a novel regulator of zzso in zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso in zzso and in zzso The neck and motor domain of zzso associates with the zzso domain of zzso zzso is a novel zzso of zzso and the zzso stimulates its zzso zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso causes a dramatic increase in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso of a zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso with sister zzso bridges, suggesting that precise regulation of the zzso activity by zzso zzso is critical for proper zzso dynamics and essential for the faithful zzso zzso We reasoned that dynamic regulation of zzso zzso by zzso is required to orchestrate faithful cell division, whereas the high levels of zzso and zzso activities seen in cancer cells may account for a mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso zzso
