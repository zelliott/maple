zzso since 1990 in France, cancer zzso has been strengthened since 2003 by the zzso zzso zzso which resulted in an improvement of the zzso of zzso The aim of this review is to present an update of the zzso of the needs of the population in this field for the next ten years, provided by a group of experts mandated by the French National Cancer zzso Identification and management of major zzso zzso to cancer have a major impact on decrease in mortality and zzso zzso of criteria for the detection of zzso zzso could be substantially improved by enlarging the indication for genetic testing to isolated cases of zzso cancer occurring before 70 years and to familial cases occurring after this age zzso In the Lynch syndrome, the present criteria would have an excellent sensitivity for the detection of zzso in the mismatch repair zzso genes if the zzso of zzso on zzso instability zzso zzso was effective, but these criteria are actually poorly zzso However, genetic testing should not be proposed to all the patients affected by zzso belonging to the spectrum of major zzso and a zzso to unaffected persons unless an affected relative has been identified as a zzso The prescription of tests should continue to be strictly controlled and zzso in patients as well as in zzso zzso The enlargement of criteria and the improvement in the spreading of recommendations should result in an increase of genetic zzso activity and of the prescriptions of tests by a factor 2 to 4, and to a lesser extent in the clinical management of at risk zzso In a near future, it appears important to mandate experts on specific issues such as the zzso of the lack of effective application of zzso screening for zzso zzso the recommendations for the identification and the management of zzso zzso or the zzso value of zzso characteristics for the identification of zzso zzso The expected increase in cancer zzso activity will need an optimal zzso to increase the zzso Such measures will help in facing up to new zzso that will probably be identified in common zzso
