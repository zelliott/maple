zzso of several inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso was investigated in the National Cancer Institute panel of 60 human tumor cell lines, and the expression and zzso significance of one of these, zzso was evaluated in 78 previously zzso patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in most cancer lines zzso with substantial zzso in their relative zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was not zzso and zzso was found at the zzso and protein levels in only 34 zzso and 5 zzso of the 60 tumor cell lines zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels did not correlate with protein levels in the tumor lines, indicating zzso regulation of zzso High levels of zzso protein in tumor cell lines were unexpectedly correlated with sensitivity to some zzso drugs, particularly zzso and other zzso whereas higher levels of zzso protein levels were associated with resistance to several zzso zzso The relevance of zzso to in zzso responses to zzso was explored in zzso making correlations with patient outcome zzso zzso zzso Patients with lower levels of zzso protein had significantly longer survival zzso 133 versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a tendency toward longer zzso duration zzso 87 versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso than those with higher levels of zzso Altogether, these findings show that zzso are widely but zzso expressed in human zzso and zzso and suggest that higher zzso protein levels may have adverse zzso significance for patients with zzso
