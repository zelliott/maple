zzso cells exploit their zzso by growth factors and zzso such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso to stimulate abnormal vessel formation that is leaky and zzso causing irregular blood zzso The combination of poor zzso raised zzso fluid pressure and areas of vascular collapse leads to zzso within zzso The latter activates factors such as zzso zzso factor 1 zzso that serve to make cancer cells more aggressive and also markedly influences the response of zzso tumors to conventional zzso and zzso zzso data now suggest that blockade of zzso zzso for example by zzso zzso might consist a promising strategy since these agents do not only possess zzso effects but can also alter tumor zzso and zzso to improve the response to radiation and zzso In many cases, these changes are related to zzso of zzso and zzso Here, we review the zzso of tumor zzso zzso and how it adversely affects cancer zzso The complex interaction of tumor zzso and zzso is examined together the zzso evidence supporting a zzso role for zzso zzso We will discuss the expanding role of zzso zzso especially zzso on tumor zzso Special emphasis will be paid to the potential of different zzso pathways blockade and other indirect zzso strategies to alter the zzso for the benefit of cancer treatment, as an alternative to the classical zzso zzso
