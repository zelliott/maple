Poor access to or inadequate health insurance contributes to disparities in cancer zzso and zzso Cancer registry zzso zzso data is collected by many cancer zzso in the United States and has been used to compare cancer outcomes across insurance zzso 

We evaluated the zzso of cancer registry data on patient Medicaid status against enrollment data from zzso California's Medicaid zzso 

Data from the statewide California Cancer zzso for persons under age 65 years diagnosed with 1) any cancer in 1998 and 1999 or 2) with invasive cervical cancer between 1996 and 1999 were obtained and linked zzso to zzso enrollment zzso We compared registry Medicaid status, determined from payer source information, against linkage results and used zzso to calculate sensitivity, zzso and positive zzso zzso These measures were compared across different hospital and patient characteristics and cancer zzso 

Cancer registry Medicaid status data had poor sensitivity zzso good specificity zzso and moderate positive zzso value zzso zzso of zzso did not vary substantially by cancer type, stage, patient age, sex, vital status, zzso socioeconomic status, or diagnosing hospital zzso zzso data zzso the number of Medicaid patients by zzso and incorrectly assigned Medicaid as a payer to approximately zzso of zzso 

As a result of the poor zzso of cancer registry Medicaid status data, caution should be used when interpreting cancer outcomes by insurance type calculated from registry payer source zzso zzso of registry data to Medicaid enrollment files represents a more accurate means of identifying Medicaid insurance zzso
