zzso interventions have helped patients with cancer improve their quality of life, decrease treatment related distress, and manage zzso However, quantitative findings from music intervention studies are zzso 

The purpose of this review was to explore the theoretical zzso for the selection of the music stimuli used to influence targeted zzso It was hypothesized that disparate findings were due in part to the zzso nature of music selection and the resulting diversity in music stimuli between and within zzso 

A systematic research synthesis including a comprehensive database and reference list search resulted in 22 zzso Included studies were compiled into two tables cataloging intervention theory, intervention content, and zzso 

A majority of studies did not provide a rationale or intervention theory for the delivery of music or choice of zzso Recorded music was the most common delivery method, but the specific music was rarely included within the zzso Only two studies that included a theoretical framework reported zzso results on at least some of the zzso zzso results are partially explained by an incomplete or mismatch in intervention theory and music selection and zzso 

While the inclusion of an intervention theory does not guarantee positive results, including a theoretical rationale for the use of music, particular therapeutic processes or mechanisms, and the specifics of how music is selected and delivered increases scientific rigor and the probability of clinical zzso
