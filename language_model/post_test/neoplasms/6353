The prescription of some zzso therapies is now based on the detection of specific genetic zzso that should be determined as early as possible not to put patients at a zzso In 2009, the zzso platform of molecular zzso zzso zzso developed a zzso to evaluate and to improve the zzso of molecular cancer zzso particularly the analysis of the zzso zzso The objective was to describe the analysis process, the organization of pathology laboratories and the delays between the different zzso of the zzso 

We established a working group to describe the different steps between the prescription of molecular biology analyses and the analysis zzso A retrospective study based on the first quarter of 2009 allowed us to measure management zzso In addition, a pathology laboratory zzso questionnaire allowed us to identify zzso features hindering rapid zzso 

The median delay between the analysis prescription and the results was 15 days zzso zzso zzso zzso explaining longer delays were highlighted not only in the pathology laboratories (for example, pending of the prescription before sending the analysis, waiting for several cases before sending the material, sample zzso sending by standard zzso but also within the zzso (for example, sample testing by another technique or new extraction for zzso zzso 

The results of this study zzso the necessity of speeding up zzso zzso and of creating an electronic procedure and regional facilities in order to provide results more rapidly to zzso
