In recent times, modern gene technology has led to a new understanding of the role of the human zzso in the development of some zzso zzso in zzso As a result, models based on zzso analysis of the interactions between zzso and zzso cells have been zzso Cancer appears to be the result of inadequate control of the host cell over zzso viral zzso zzso infection is the necessary precondition for zzso but it is not sufficient to trigger the growth of a zzso This can only occur if the cellular control genes are impaired possibly as the result of a zzso effect of simultaneous factors such as zzso infections, zzso radiation, X-rays, or chemical zzso
