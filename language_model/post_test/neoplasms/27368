The general utility of the maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso a strategy aimed at zzso the chance of total tumor cell zzso is here zzso Evidence to date suggests that for many tumors the potential for zzso is in fact remote, with patients consistently demonstrating tumor cell presence subsequent to zzso treatments having zzso zzso The failure to eradicate is attributed largely to the zzso nature of the zzso zzso cell populations demonstrate short-term zzso to zzso dose delivery, but zzso as part of dose recovery, showing increased overall zzso to a given series of doses when delivered more evenly zzso It is zzso zzso that the zzso of total tumor burden, rather than complete zzso may often be the more practical zzso and zzso that regularly zzso zzso dosing is the best way to achieve zzso As a zzso it is found that the more efficient ability of the tumor zzso cells to zzso following dosing predicts a targeting bias towards the zzso compartment of a tumor when zzso dosing is zzso This lends theoretical support to recent empirical studies showing that regularly spaced dosing schedules with no extended rest periods act more zzso thereby delaying or avoiding the onset of acquired zzso
