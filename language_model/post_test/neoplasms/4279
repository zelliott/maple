This presentation reviews the issue of contrast media dosing and imaging protocols for the optimal MR imaging detection and characterization of zzso The cumulative clinical experience gained in performing zzso MR examinations with zzso zzso indicates that a dose of zzso zzso body weight provides safe and effective enhancement of most zzso zzso zzso lower than zzso zzso have been shown to be inadequate for zzso all but selected types of zzso pathology, such as masses with a high zzso to background ratio on zzso images zzso zzso or zzso located in areas in which the normal tissue very rapidly takes up contrast agent zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Recent clinical studies have suggested a role for high dose zzso administration (up to zzso zzso for the optimal detection and zzso of cerebral zzso or other small or poorly enhancing zzso zzso in the zzso characteristics zzso zzso zzso location, zzso of specific diseased zzso may require varying doses or even a different contrast agent to be used for optimal imaging zzso As new MR contrast agents and new scanning techniques are introduced, the specific diagnostic question posed will likely determine the choice of pulse zzso contrast agent and dose zzso
