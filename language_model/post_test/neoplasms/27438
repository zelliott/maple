To investigate zzso activity in cancer and zzso Asian patients using zzso and to reveal possible alternative traits for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was administered to 27 cancer and 24 zzso patients, zzso Plasma was sampled at 0, zzso zzso 1, zzso 2, zzso and 5 h after intravenous zzso 30 s zzso Plasma zzso and zzso zzso were determined using zzso The disposition of zzso and zzso in these patients was zzso zzso clearance was correlated with zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and steady state volume of distribution zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso in cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients, respectively, were not different and comparable with published zzso zzso zzso was 4-5 fold in both zzso zzso clearance correlated significantly with all plasma zzso dose at and after the zzso time point, with a minimum correlation zzso of r zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso activities determined with different doses of zzso in cancer and zzso Asian patients showed zzso of zzso and were not different between zzso One to zzso plasma zzso zzso per dose may be feasible as a simple alternative zzso trait for zzso zzso activity zzso
