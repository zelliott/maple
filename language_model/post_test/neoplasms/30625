zzso fiber is a general zzso It covers a wide variety of substances that belong to the family of carbohydrates that resist zzso by human zzso zzso but are fermented by zzso zzso The main zzso effects of dietary fiber are primarily on gastric zzso and small zzso transit time, resulting in an improved zzso tolerance and a decreased zzso of zzso second, on zzso transit time and large zzso functions due to zzso by zzso microbial zzso or zzso zzso The so-called soluble dietary fibers are fermented to a large extent by a wide variety of zzso bacteria that result in an increase in bacterial zzso an increase in zzso mass, a change in zzso zzso and production of short chain fatty acids and various gases as zzso end zzso The zzso fibers are only marginally zzso they serve almost exclusively as zzso agents that result in shorter transit time and increased zzso zzso The short chain fatty acids resulting from the zzso zzso of dietary fiber are largely absorbed via the portal blood and reach both the liver and the peripheral zzso They induce changes in zzso and fat metabolism leading to zzso zzso and long-term zzso zzso and zzso are zzso with a degree of zzso of 2 to 60 and 2 to 20, zzso Due to the structural zzso of their zzso bridge zzso zzso they both resist the zzso by human zzso zzso Moreover, when reaching the zzso both zzso and zzso are almost zzso fermented almost exclusively by zzso zzso and zzso Such an extensive zzso causes an increase in zzso bacterial zzso a decrease in zzso zzso and produces a large amount of zzso products among which the short chain fatty acids that exert systemic effects on zzso zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso have most of the characteristics of a dietary fiber and the proposal is made to zzso them as zzso Moreover, they are zzso factors, because, due to still unknown reasons, they are primarily fermented by zzso It is concluded from this review that zzso zzso even though they are not included in the zzso fraction that is zzso as dietary fiber by classic zzso methods, have most of the zzso effects of a dietary zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
