Cancer is the result of the progressive acquisition of multiple zzso traits through the zzso of genetic or zzso zzso Recent studies have established a functional role of zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene 1) in several crucial aspects of tumor zzso including zzso evasion of zzso invasion, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso is frequently observed in melanoma, zzso zzso and zzso of breast, zzso liver, and esophagus and is correlated with poor clinical zzso zzso functions as a downstream zzso of the transforming activity of zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso activates the zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways to stimulate zzso invasion, cell survival, and zzso The zzso domain of zzso also mediates the zzso of tumor cells to the zzso of distant zzso and promotes zzso These findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of zzso may simultaneously suppress tumor growth, block zzso and enhance the efficacy of zzso zzso
