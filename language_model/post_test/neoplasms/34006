This review summarizes the major features of zzso genes and zzso the patterns of zzso trafficking of zzso zzso and how they sample different zzso compartments for zzso and foreign zzso We describe how zzso zzso bind to zzso molecules with their zzso chains buried in zzso pockets and expose their polar zzso zzso whose fine structure is recognized by the zzso of zzso T zzso zzso T cells carry out zzso zzso and zzso functions and interact with other cell types including zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, T cells, and B cells, thereby contributing to both innate and zzso immune zzso zzso gained from mice and humans now delineate the extensive range of diseases in which zzso T cells play important roles and reveal differences in the role of zzso zzso and zzso in contrast to zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and rapid zzso responses empower a subset of zzso T cells zzso zzso to have unique zzso functions without counterpart among zzso T zzso This review describes the function of zzso T cells in zzso responses, zzso zzso and in regulating the balance between tolerance and zzso
