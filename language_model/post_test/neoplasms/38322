Cancer survival varies widely between zzso The zzso study provides survival estimates for zzso million adults zzso zzso zzso diagnosed with a first, primary, invasive cancer of the breast zzso zzso zzso or prostate during zzso and followed up to 1999, by use of individual zzso records from 101 zzso cancer zzso in 31 countries on five zzso This is, to our knowledge, the first worldwide analysis of cancer survival, with standard quality-control procedures and identical zzso methods for all zzso 

To compensate for wide international differences in general population zzso mortality by age, sex, country, region, calendar period, and (in the zzso ethnic origin, we estimated relative survival, the ratio of survival noted in the patients with cancer, and the survival that would have been expected had they been subject only to the background mortality zzso zzso life tables were zzso Survival estimates were also adjusted for differences in the age structure of populations of patients with zzso 

Global variation in cancer survival was very zzso zzso relative survival for breast, zzso and prostate cancer was generally higher in North America, Australia, Japan, and zzso zzso and southern Europe, and lower in zzso Brazil, and eastern zzso zzso has provided the first opportunity to estimate cancer survival in 11 states in USA covered by the National Program of Cancer zzso zzso and the study covers zzso of the US population, zzso more than previously zzso Cancer survival in black men and women was systematically and substantially lower than in white men and women in all 16 states and six metropolitan areas zzso Relative survival for all zzso combined was zzso lower in states covered by zzso than in areas covered by the Surveillance zzso and End zzso zzso zzso zzso relative survival by use of the appropriate zzso and zzso life tables was up to zzso lower for breast cancer and up to zzso lower for prostate cancer than with the zzso national life tables used by the zzso zzso These differences in population coverage and zzso method have both contributed to the survival deficit noted between Europe and the USA, from which only zzso data have been available until zzso 

Until now, direct comparisons of cancer survival between high-income and low-income countries have not generally been zzso The information provided here might therefore be a useful stimulus for zzso The findings should eventually facilitate joint assessment of international trends in zzso survival, and mortality as indicators of cancer zzso
