In clinical trials, researchers often encounter testing for equality of survival medians across study arms based on censored zzso Even though zzso and zzso introduced a method for comparing medians of several survival zzso still some researchers misuse procedures that are designed for testing the zzso of survival zzso These procedures include the zzso zzso and Cox zzso This practice leads to inflation of the probability of a type I error, particularly when the underlying assumptions of these procedures are not zzso We propose a new zzso method for testing the equality of several survival medians based on the zzso zzso from randomly zzso zzso We derive zzso properties of this test zzso Through simulations, we zzso and compare the empirical probabilities of type I errors and the power of this new procedure with those of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our simulation results indicate that the performance of these test procedures depends on the level of zzso and appropriateness of the underlying zzso When the objective is to test zzso of survival medians rather than survival zzso and the assumptions of these tests are not met, some of these procedures severely zzso the probability of a type I zzso In these situations, our test statistic provides an alternative to the zzso zzso
