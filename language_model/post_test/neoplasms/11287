zzso drugs have a complex pharmacological and zzso profile with a narrow therapeutic zzso It is therefore critical to understand the factors that contribute to the marked zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso often observed with zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso drug metabolism represents a major drug disposition pathway, extensive efforts are made to thoroughly investigate metabolism of zzso compounds during the zzso and clinical development zzso as well as to address issues encountered during the clinical use of an approved zzso In recent years there has been a significant paradigm shift in zzso drug metabolism zzso Most importantly, this has included a reduced reliance on animal models and increased use of human zzso zzso human liver zzso and other cellular zzso primary culture of human zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso Typically, experiments are performed using these tools to identify the phase I and/or phase II zzso involved in metabolism of the zzso agent and for zzso zzso Additionally, issues pertaining to the rate, extent and zzso of the zzso or induction of the zzso pathways are also zzso These studies provide important clues about various aspects of the disposition of a therapeutic agent including zzso zzso elimination zzso overall zzso and the potential for zzso zzso The zzso used for in zzso assessment of drug metabolism and their applications to drug development and clinical zzso with special emphasis on zzso drugs are reviewed in this zzso
