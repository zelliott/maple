The clinical usefulness of a newly developed ultrasound zzso system was zzso 

The zzso system uses a modified zzso zzso operated at zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso has a zzso part at the center to reduce the central hot zzso zzso sweeping technique is also used to eliminate the zzso hot spot around the zzso zzso tumors in 29 patients were examined in this zzso In 35 tumors, zzso was given in conjunction with zzso and/or chemotherapy, and in the remaining 3 tumors, zzso alone was zzso In all, a total of 153 zzso sessions were zzso 

The number of zzso sessions per tumor ranged from 1 to 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso points per session ranged from 1 to 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso The average zzso temperature for tumors with a maximum depth of zzso zzso 3-6 zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso degrees C, zzso The percentage of monitored zzso points with temperature exceeding 42 degrees C was 56 zzso zzso 43 zzso zzso and 21 zzso zzso zzso Of the 30 zzso tumors treated with combined zzso 12 showed complete response, 14 partial response, and 4 no zzso zzso complications included pain at the treatment site in 13 of the 153 treatment sessions and zzso formation in 3 of the 38 treatment zzso No serious complication was zzso 

These results indicate that the newly developed ultrasound zzso system is clinically useful for the treatment of localized superficial and subsurface tumors with a maximum tumor depth of no more than 6 zzso
