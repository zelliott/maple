Starting from 1969, the yearly number of patients with pulmonary embolism documented in the zzso Chiara Hospital of zzso is increased, in spite of the unchanged diagnostic zzso zzso of this work is to verify if this trend is accompanied by earlier diagnosis with an improvement in the clinical outcome of pulmonary zzso and if a relevant diagnostic failure is still present in our zzso A comparison of pulmonary embolism cases collected from 1969 to 1971 and from 1980 to 1982 showed that the number of diagnoses made within one week from the onset of symptoms is increased zzso whereas the number of diagnoses made after more than one month is reduced zzso At the same time we observed that cases with a standard zzso less than 40 zzso are reduced zzso while cases with a standard zzso greater than 50 zzso are increased zzso An earlier diagnosis of pulmonary embolism contributed to treat a larger percentage of patients zzso and to lower the early mortality zzso This diagnostic trend can be ascribed to an increased readiness in raising the clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism and to the prompt availability of zzso lung zzso that is the center of our diagnostic zzso Data of our zzso patients, compared with those of zzso series and with the number of admissions, surgical operations and deaths in the zzso of our hospital, suggest some persistent diagnostic failure in patients with well documented zzso zzso such as injured, burned, patients affected by zzso or motor zzso patients operated for orthopedic or zzso zzso
