We have previously identified two genes zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region that are frequently zzso and zzso in human breast cancer and in zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso zzso zzso Verhoeven, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report on the characterization of the zzso protein that is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparison shows a high zzso zzso to a chicken protein that was recently identified as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Reynolds, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Parsons, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that in zzso cells, the human zzso protein is localized mainly in the zzso and, to a very low extent, in protruding leading zzso of the zzso However, in zzso cells that zzso zzso the protein as a result of amplification of the zzso zzso the zzso except in zzso accumulates in the zzso zzso junctions associated with the zzso contact zzso The protein was not found in zzso zzso zzso Our findings, and the previously reported observations in zzso chicken zzso zzso suggest that the zzso protein is involved in regulating the interactions between components of zzso zzso Since amplification of the zzso region has been associated with an enhanced invasive potential of these tumors, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso protein in the zzso contact sites might, therefore, contribute to the invasive potential of these tumor zzso
