The zzso zzso of proteins on zzso or zzso zzso preceding zzso zzso is a major cellular signaling zzso Although it is proposed that zzso regulates the function of proteins by inducing a zzso change, there are few clues about the actual zzso changes and their zzso Recent identification of the novel zzso zzso zzso that specifically zzso only the zzso zzso bonds in certain proteins led us to propose a new signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in proteins following zzso to regulate protein zzso Emerging data indicate that such zzso changes have profound effects on zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso location and/or zzso Furthermore, this zzso mechanism might play an important role in cell growth control and diseases such as cancer and zzso
