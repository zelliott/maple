An area of therapeutic interest in cancer biology and treatment is targeting the cancer stem cell, more appropriately referred to as the cancer initiating cell zzso zzso comprise a subset of zzso zzso rare cancer cells with the ability to initiate cancer in zzso in genetically modified zzso zzso zzso are thought to be responsible for tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may lay dormant after various cancer therapies which eliminate the more rapidly zzso bulk cancer zzso zzso However, zzso may zzso after therapy is discontinued as they may represent cells which were either zzso resistant to the original therapeutic approach or they have acquired zzso which zzso resistance to the primary zzso In experimental mouse tumor transplant models, zzso have the ability to transfer the tumor to zzso mice very efficiently while the zzso are not able to do so as zzso Often zzso display increased expression of proteins involved in drug resistance and hence they are zzso resistant to many zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso may be in a suspended state of proliferation and not sensitive to common zzso and zzso approaches often employed to eliminate the rapidly zzso zzso Promising therapeutic approaches include the targeting of certain signal zzso pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with small zzso zzso or targeting specific zzso molecules zzso zzso with effective zzso zzso The existence of zzso could explain the high frequency of zzso and resistance to many currently used cancer zzso New approaches should be developed to effectively target the zzso which could vastly improve cancer therapies and zzso This review will discuss recent concepts of targeting zzso in certain leukemia zzso
