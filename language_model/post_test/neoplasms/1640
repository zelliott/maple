The zzso of the UK Atomic Energy Authority has been the subject of several previous zzso zzso 

To detect and investigate associations between mortality rates and employment in a substantially increased cohort size and follow up extended to zzso 

The new cohort included 51 zzso employees, of whom 10 zzso were zzso zzso rates for all workers were low compared to national rates, as were rates in radiation workers and for workers monitored for internal zzso For radiation workers all cause mortality and all cancer mortality were significantly lower than for zzso zzso There was no overall trend of increasing mortality with radiation zzso There was little evidence of raised mortality from zzso The association of zzso cancer with radiation dose was much less significant than in previous zzso However, the relatively high mortality from zzso zzso among radiation workers zzso though the numbers were very zzso The association was with zzso rather than cervical zzso zzso from cancer of the zzso was high among radiation workers, but was not correlated with zzso 

Overall, radiation workers at zzso showed no excess zzso The previously detected association of prostate cancer with high radiation dose may have been a statistical zzso or a risk associated with discontinued zzso zzso cancer occurred at higher rates in female radiation workers, but, because there was no correlation with dose, may well be due to something other than their radiation zzso Cancer of the zzso in radiation workers was almost certainly related to past zzso zzso
