The relative biological effectiveness zzso of zzso and other types of densely zzso radiation appears to be close to zzso for the induction of strand breaks, but considerably higher zzso have been found for cellular end points such as zzso zzso This may be due to differences in the processing of strand breaks or to the involvement of other zzso whose yields are more dependent on radiation zzso Because cell cycle delays may be of great importance in the processing of DNA damage, we determined the zzso for disturbances of the zzso phase in four different cell types zzso melanoma, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared them with the zzso for cell zzso The method we used to determine the progress from zzso into S was as zzso zzso were zzso for a number of days and then zzso to grow with culture medium containing normal amounts of zzso Immediately before the change of zzso cells were exposed to graded doses of either 240 zzso X rays or 6 zzso zzso At different times afterward, cells were labeled with zzso and the numbers of active zzso cells were assessed using zzso flow zzso For all four cell types, cells started to progress from zzso into S after a few zzso zzso suppressed this process in all cases, but there were some interesting zzso For zzso and zzso cells, the most obvious effect was a delay in zzso the labeling index increased a few hours later in zzso samples than in controls, and there was no significant effect on the maximum labeling zzso For zzso and zzso cells, although smaller doses were used because of greater zzso a delay of the entry into S phase was again zzso but the most significant effect was a reduction in the maximum percentage of active zzso cells after zzso indicating a permanent or long-term arrest in zzso The zzso for the zzso delay was the same for all four cell types, about zzso while the zzso for the zzso arrest varied between zzso for the most resistant zzso cells and zzso for the most sensitive zzso zzso This trend was similar to that observed for the zzso for cell zzso If, as described above, the same number of strand breaks per dose is induced by zzso and by X rays, the signal zzso cascade translates them into a greater zzso delay in the case of higher zzso This appears to be independent of repair capacity, because it is similar in all cell types we zzso We therefore assume that a higher zzso density or the presence of other types of zzso is important for this relatively early zzso A zzso arrest, however, is more closely related to the later events leading to cell zzso where strand break repair does play a major role, influencing X-ray sensitivity more strongly than sensitivity to zzso because of a lower zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso
