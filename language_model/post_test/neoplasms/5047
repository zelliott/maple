It is known that zzso channels are important for cell zzso zzso a zzso channel zzso is a zzso zzso which increases in concentration on the cell surface of cancer zzso Apart from cancer cells, this protein is found only in the brain & heart zzso in very low zzso The proliferation of cells in cancer is dependent on zzso of this zzso and it has been noted that blocking of this protein with drug zzso helps inhibit the proliferation of the cells zzso The current work aims to study the binding zzso of zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso channel of tumor cells, where zzso zzso has been zzso The toxin under consideration zzso zzso zzso is a 27 zzso zzso The zzso studies suggest that the zzso binds zzso to the zzso zzso The study shows that the zzso interacts with the charged zzso unit of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso portion of the zzso domain named zzso zzso zzso Study of binding of toxins of similar origin, with normal zzso channels has been studied in zzso Further, wet laboratory work needs to be conducted for development of a drug zzso from this zzso to treat some number of zzso
