To determine zzso and overall cancer zzso as part of a three-pronged investigation in response to the concerns of a First Nations community in Alberta, Canada, located close to zzso natural gas installations, and to determine whether the zzso of zzso observed in this reserve was higher than zzso 

A population zzso with information identifying First Nations status and band affiliation was linked to the zzso Cancer zzso to determine cancer zzso cases between 1995 and 2006 for zzso and zzso study zzso Using indirect standardized zzso ratios, observed cancer zzso cases for the study populations were compared with cases expected based on three separate reference zzso 

zzso zzso and overall cancer zzso cases within the First Nations community were not higher than zzso zzso cancer zzso cases, however, were higher than expected for zzso and zzso zzso public health measures designed to address this risk have been implemented and zzso surveillance of cancer zzso in the community will be zzso
