To identify long peptides zzso derived from a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso family member zzso zzso which induce zzso zzso type 1 zzso cells and zzso 

We combined information from a recently developed computer zzso predicting zzso class zzso peptides with zzso zzso sequences presented by zzso zzso or zzso zzso to select candidate zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso derived from healthy donors or patients with zzso zzso tumor zzso were used to study the zzso of zzso and the in zzso zzso potential of zzso bearing zzso zzso We used zzso transgenic mice to address whether vaccination with zzso zzso efficient zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso response to zzso in zzso patients receiving zzso with zzso zzso peptides was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We identified zzso zzso bearing naturally processed zzso recognized by zzso T cells and zzso zzso zzso were induced by vaccination with a zzso in zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso of zzso by zzso and significant zzso of zzso zzso cell responses were detected after short-term in zzso stimulation of zzso with zzso in 50% of zzso patients, but not in healthy zzso Furthermore, these responses were associated with zzso expression in zzso zzso 

These are the first results showing the presence of zzso zzso cell responses in zzso patients and underline the possible utility of zzso for propagation of zzso cells and zzso
