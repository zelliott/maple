zzso progress has been made in the past two decades in mapping zzso and zzso zzso defining a function for these master zzso and identifying novel zzso drug zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a central component of a zzso zzso controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso that have a central role in cancer zzso One limitation of current human cancer research is the difficulty in developing genetic models that reveal the zzso regulation of a growth zzso like zzso within the zzso of a human zzso zzso such insights is important since zzso models and human tissue culture cell lines do not necessarily predict how zzso like zzso are regulated in zzso and therefore what factors can affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer research aims to link basic research zzso and clinical biology by uncovering zzso pathways not revealed by other zzso This approach is exemplified by two studies in this edition of zzso both use a set of zzso human zzso with the objective of identifying novel zzso control of the zzso zzso zzso The authors have revealed two unexpected zzso modifications of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at its zzso site in the absence of zzso DNA zzso and zzso the production of zzso and inactive zzso of zzso These studies highlight the need to develop model systems to understand why zzso pathways are being triggered or suppressed in different human zzso and whether the zzso machinery can be manipulated to control the activity of zzso for therapeutic zzso
