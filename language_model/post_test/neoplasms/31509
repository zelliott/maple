The aim of this study was to examine the possible link between isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The data from three population based zzso studies (in zzso zzso and zzso were pooled and mortality rates were determined in zzso people who were followed for between 5 and 12 zzso 

There were zzso people with previously diagnosed diabetes, and 799 with newly diagnosed diabetes, of whom 243 zzso had isolated zzso zzso In comparison with people without diabetes, people with isolated zzso zzso had an increased risk of zzso mortality zzso zzso hazards ratio (95 % zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso - zzso and of cardiovascular mortality zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso - zzso In addition, men with isolated zzso zzso had a high risk of cancer death zzso zzso 

These data show that isolated zzso zzso which can only be identified by the zzso zzso is common, and at least doubles the mortality zzso This should be considered in the design of screening zzso that use only zzso zzso
