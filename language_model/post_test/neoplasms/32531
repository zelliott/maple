The final proof of principle that cancer patients can be effectively treated with zzso zzso is eagerly zzso Various zzso in zzso experiments have proven that most zzso need new vessel formation in order to grow and to form zzso First of all, zzso do not grow in avascular zzso until new blood vessels reach the zzso zzso the introduction of only one zzso gene can cause a switch from zzso dormancy to progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso growth can be inhibited and sometimes zzso zzso can be obtained just by attacking the vascular compartment with specific zzso zzso These three examples of zzso experiments and many others have led to the conclusion that, in general, zzso are zzso zzso by disappointing clinical results, the zzso dependency of zzso has been questioned, mainly because of the zzso and the presumed lack of a functional blood supply zzso delivery and discarding of waste zzso from a newly formed zzso zzso However, human zzso are highly zzso in vascular architecture, zzso and functional blood zzso zzso zzso is a natural consequence of a genetically based unlimited expansion of zzso cells, compared to the zzso growth of different zzso during embryonic development, for zzso Unlimited zzso expansion and therefore the continuous stimulation of vessel outgrowth prevent zzso cells from generating a mature zzso but instead continuously stimulate them to expand the vascular compartment of the growing zzso In this review, the translation of zzso zzso as a treatment for cancer from zzso experiments to the clinic is zzso The zzso evidence that zzso are zzso is summarized and explanations are put forward for why the clinical results so far are not as exciting as was expected from zzso zzso Reviewing the translation, one may conclude that human zzso are zzso in their vascular architecture and function and that zzso zzso in humans is a more complex zzso zzso process compared with zzso in zzso cancer zzso
