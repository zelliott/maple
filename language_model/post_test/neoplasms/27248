zzso was first recognized for its effects on B cells and zzso where it zzso class II zzso promoted zzso class switching and inhibited inflammatory zzso zzso It was also thought to be functionally redundant with zzso However, studies conducted with knockout mice, zzso zzso and novel zzso demonstrate that zzso possesses several unique zzso functions that distinguish it from zzso Resistance to most gastrointestinal zzso is zzso by zzso zzso responses, in which zzso plays a dominant zzso By regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso organisms including zzso major, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is the central zzso of allergic zzso where it regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso and airway zzso zzso of zzso zzso function may also prove useful in the treatment of some zzso like zzso chronic zzso leukemia and Hodgkin's disease, where zzso zzso zzso or tumor cell zzso zzso can also inhibit tumor zzso As such, zzso of zzso might be effective as cancer zzso by boosting zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso was revealed as a potent zzso of tissue zzso in both zzso and zzso which indicates that it is a key regulator of the zzso zzso The mechanisms that regulate zzso production and/or function have also been investigated, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso complex play important zzso This review highlights the zzso functions of zzso and describes multiple pathways for modulating its activity in zzso
