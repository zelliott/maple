zzso tools have been developed to efficiently engineer zzso specificity and enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso use the zzso variable segments to direct specificity against cell surface zzso zzso receptors zzso can redirect T cells to zzso target zzso fragments of which are presented in the zzso groove of zzso zzso A recent clinical trial with zzso T cells redirected against the zzso lineage zzso zzso showed dramatic clinical benefit in chronic zzso zzso zzso Similarly, impressive clinical responses were seen in melanoma and zzso cell zzso with zzso T cells redirected against the zzso lineage zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso However, on and zzso toxicity was associated with most of these clinical responses, and fatal complications have been observed in some patients treated with gene modified T zzso This review will discuss factors that might contribute to toxic side effects of therapy with gene modified T cells, and outline potential strategies to retain zzso activity while reducing unwanted side zzso
