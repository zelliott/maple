The zzso expression of a protein that is involved in normal growth regulatory pathways can cause cell zzso One of the best examples of this phenomenon is the transformation of zzso by the zzso zzso virus zzso An zzso zzso of this virus encodes a protein whose zzso acid sequence is highly zzso to one of the zzso of a zzso cell zzso zzso growth factor zzso How does expression of the zzso or related genes transform cells? Clearly, this process uses zzso pathways involved in the normal actions of growth zzso For example, the zzso protein appears to act through cellular zzso zzso The zzso consequences of zzso zzso zzso include increased zzso zzso activity, enhanced expression of a set of genes associated with cell zzso the dramatic zzso in cellular zzso a rapid turnover of membrane zzso and the commitment of the cell to proceed through a series of responses culminating in the replication of zzso An important issue is whether, in zzso transformed cells, these zzso pathways are simply zzso by an abundance of self-made growth factor, or are there qualitative zzso in the pathways that are unique to these zzso Several specific related questions are addressed in this zzso Is the protein zzso by the zzso gene functionally identical to zzso Does the zzso protein act at the cell surface or at zzso zzso In the action of zzso compounds, what are the zzso steps zzso to zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
