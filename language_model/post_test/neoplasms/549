The zzso of 250 chemicals in 2 species, usually the rat and the zzso was obtained from the published literature through 3 independent zzso Of the 250 compounds zzso 38% were zzso in both rats and mice, and zzso were zzso in both zzso A total of 43 compounds had different results in the two species, 21 zzso being zzso in mice only, 17 zzso in rats only and 5 zzso having differing results from other zzso A comparison of the major target zzso affected by chemicals zzso in both species revealed that zzso of the chemicals studied produced cancer at the same zzso This comparison of zzso activity in 2 species suggests that zzso from results in a zzso study to man may be subject to substantial zzso
