Overnight zzso storage of peripheral blood stem cell zzso occurs frequently in clinical zzso However, there are no standard guidelines for optimal storage conditions of freshly harvested zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of storage temperatures on the quality of zzso zzso and establish optimal storage conditions before zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed on 260 zzso harvests according to zzso conditions: immediate processing or ON storage at room temperature zzso For direct comparison, 30 zzso zzso products were collected zzso and prepared under three different zzso conditions: immediate processing, ON storage at zzso and ON storage at zzso The recovery of zzso cells, zzso zzso count and viability were zzso 

zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso count was significantly lower when zzso were stored ON at zzso compared to when immediately processed zzso zzso zzso Prospective analysis showed a mean recovery of zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for immediate processing, ON storage at zzso and ON storage at zzso zzso Similarly, mean viability and zzso counts were significantly reduced when stored ON at zzso compared to when immediately processed or stored ON at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

ON storage of zzso zzso at zzso significantly decreased the quality of zzso These data indicate that ON storage of zzso zzso at zzso would be the most reasonable approach for maintaining the quality of zzso when immediate processing is not zzso
