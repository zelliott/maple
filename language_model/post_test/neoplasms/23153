Although zzso are highly zzso at the zzso level, they can manifest common patterns of gene zzso Here, we use gene expression signatures to interrogate two major processes in cancer, proliferation and tissue zzso We demonstrate that proliferation and zzso signatures are partially independent and result in four distinctive cancer zzso zzso with the proliferation signature are characterized by signatures of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso From the zzso point of view, proliferation is associated with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso is characterized by a zzso of zzso zzso zzso the proliferation signature zzso with poor outcome in zzso zzso breast and brain cancer, whereas zzso increases mortality rates in zzso and zzso zzso
