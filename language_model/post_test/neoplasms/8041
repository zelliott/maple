zzso of zzso zzso expression is a well-established feature of zzso zzso As one might zzso it is also characteristic of several pathological situations that are the subject of the present zzso zzso muscle zzso has proven to be a reliable marker for identifying zzso vascular smooth muscle cells during vascular development and vascular diseases, and zzso zzso during wound healing, zzso diseases, and zzso reaction to zzso zzso The hallmark of a differentiated zzso relies on the acquisition of an organized zzso apparatus characterized by zzso muscle zzso stress zzso More and more data suggest that zzso muscle zzso plays a direct role in zzso zzso activity through its zzso domain zzso zzso developed zzso against zzso and zzso zzso have allowed the detection of zzso of zzso positive zzso in adult, zzso and failing zzso These zzso have also permitted us to identify the differentiation degree of zzso cells in zzso such as zzso Whether the differential expression of zzso zzso in human diseases is functionally relevant is not yet fully established, although studies on human zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, and the zzso end of zzso muscle zzso support this zzso
