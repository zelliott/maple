zzso blocking factors, detected in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso mice with progressing zzso tumors by their interference with zzso zzso zzso with the use of zzso zzso were found to be strain related: No blocking occurred with zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso factors of zzso serum were also strain related: No zzso of zzso zzso serum was zzso There was no requirement for zzso zzso between zzso and tumor cells from which the zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso blocking serum with zzso zzso (and with zzso containing this zzso zzso removed blocking zzso zzso of zzso serum did not reduce its zzso zzso These observations indicated that certain blocking factors resembled other zzso factors in possessing zzso zzso coded by the zzso zzso of the major zzso zzso Their strain restriction and zzso specificity suggested combination with zzso zzso in blocking zzso The properties of zzso factors suggested they combine with blocking factors and resemble zzso zzso
