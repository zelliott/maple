A zzso dependence on zzso for survival and growth has led to the advancement of a variety of blood vessel directed zzso treatment zzso zzso of zzso zzso in tumor zzso and its crucial role in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso cell zzso now raises the possibility of additional novel zzso zzso The present study zzso a zzso sphere model to zzso demonstrate the zzso effect of zzso on zzso muscle cell contact and zzso evaluate the impact of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso muscle cell zzso Real time imaging of spheres showed both zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso zzso resulted in sphere zzso zzso of zzso cells from smooth muscle cell zzso The presence of zzso inhibited this zzso To assess the zzso potential of zzso in zzso nude mice were injected zzso with human zzso cell zzso cells zzso zzso and the number of blood vessels induced over a 3 day period was zzso zzso zzso 10, 20 zzso significantly reduced the initiation of blood vessels for both tumor models at all doses zzso These data indicate that zzso treatment significantly zzso the initiation of zzso by zzso the zzso zzso disruption of zzso cell interaction associated with blood vessel zzso and thereby reduces tumor cell induced zzso The results support the notion that targeting the zzso axis may offer novel zzso strategies for cancer zzso
