zzso have zzso zzso zzso that evolve ever more zzso zzso zzso Because these facts are hard to explain by conventional zzso theory, we propose here a zzso cancer zzso According to this theory, zzso initiate zzso by inducing random zzso zzso then zzso zzso zzso because it zzso the zzso by zzso teams of proteins that zzso zzso and repair zzso zzso such evolutions generate new zzso zzso which are stabilized within narrow limits against the inherent instability of zzso by selection for zzso zzso Here we have tested this theory zzso by analyzing the zzso of distinct zzso zzso which arose from mass cultures of human cells within a few months after zzso with artificially activated zzso All clones from the same parental cells had individual, zzso zzso and zzso although the parental zzso were zzso The zzso of distinct tumors formed by a given clone in zzso mice were zzso of those of the input zzso The zzso of zzso clones also evolved on passages in zzso in which they acquired either enhanced zzso spontaneously or resistance against zzso upon zzso We conclude that activated zzso initiate zzso indirectly by inducing random zzso much like conventional zzso but more effectively because the zzso are integrated into the zzso Since zzso zzso the zzso such cells evolve new, zzso zzso spontaneously, much like new zzso Because individual zzso of zzso clones correlate and zzso with individual zzso we conclude that specific zzso as a whole are the zzso of cancer zzso zzso to the flexibility of their zzso zzso zzso evolve at rates that are roughly zzso to their degrees of zzso In sum, zzso consisting of individual and flexible zzso explain the characteristic zzso stability, and flexibility of zzso
