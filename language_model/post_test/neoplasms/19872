As hypoxic cells are more resistant to zzso radiation, it is desirable to obtain information about the oxygen distribution in tumors prior to the radiation zzso zzso techniques are currently not able to provide reliable zzso maps with sufficient spatial zzso therefore mathematical models may help to simulate zzso zzso and the resulting oxygen zzso in the surrounding zzso Here, the authors present a new computer model, which uses the vascular fraction of tumor zzso in principle measurable zzso in zzso as input zzso for simulating realistic zzso zzso in tumors, assuming certain zzso vascular zzso 

zzso zzso were calculated by solving a zzso equation in a reference volume using the particle strength exchange zzso Different types of vessel zzso as well as different degrees of vascular zzso are zzso Two types of acute zzso zzso and zzso occurring additionally to zzso zzso zzso were implemented as zzso 

No statistically significant differences were observed when comparing zzso and zzso zzso zzso in all zzso and highly zzso distributed linear vessels show good agreement, when comparing with published experimental zzso distance zzso and zzso zzso It could be shown that, if information about additional acute zzso is available, its contribution to the hypoxic fraction zzso can be simulated as zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso were obtained when representative cases of zzso and zzso acute zzso respectively, were considered in the zzso 

The presented model is able to simulate realistic microscopic oxygen zzso in tumors assuming reasonable vessel zzso and using the vascular fraction as zzso input zzso The model may be used to generate zzso zzso which are needed as input in models predicting the radiation response of hypoxic zzso
