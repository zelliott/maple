The purpose of this study was to investigate if zzso zzso zzso zzso Global zzso criteria could be a useful outcome predictor of zzso acute kidney injury zzso 

In the period between January 2006 and December 2011, we identified Japanese patients who had been diagnosed with cancer and treated with zzso as a zzso chemotherapy at zzso University zzso The serum zzso was used to define zzso and determine the zzso criteria of each patient after chemotherapy within 7 zzso 

zzso patients zzso were classified as having acute kidney injury zzso going by the zzso criteria, and the numbers of patients classified into zzso stages 1, 2 and 3 were 65 zzso 18 zzso and 6 zzso zzso zzso survival times were significantly shorter in zzso stages 2 and 3 than in stage zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with all patients was zzso and that of patients who were diagnosed with cancer stage 4 was zzso 

These results suggest that zzso criteria can be a predictor of zzso mortality in patients with different primary zzso
