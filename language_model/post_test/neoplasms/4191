In this paper a fast zzso unit is introduced for zzso zzso based on image content zzso The zzso an electronic board with several zzso and zzso is designed for high-speed zzso and is directly coupled to the output of the video zzso A zzso zzso II zzso microscope with zzso zzso zzso stepping zzso was used as basic zzso The microscope images were focused by using an intensified target camera with a following zzso zzso and a zzso Thus one zzso a focus value for the current image within one video zzso Furthermore, it is possible to process three different focus functions (weighted intensity, first zzso and second zzso zzso The flexibility to select a certain focus function or a combination of these functions allows the use of the analogue detector for various cell types and fluorescent zzso In order to test the experimental zzso we use three different kinds of biological zzso zzso zzso and comet zzso which are distinguished by large differences in their zzso zzso zzso focusing is carried out in more than zzso of cases zzso of several hundred different zzso The focusing procedure is almost finished after 1-2 zzso
