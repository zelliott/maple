zzso zzso DNA zzso increasingly seen as having a fundamental role in chronic diseases like zzso DNA zzso patterns offer a route to develop zzso measures based directly on DNA zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso A novel DNA zzso measure of the zzso interactive zzso of genes is developed, in a network zzso It is shown that this measure reflects well the zzso zzso linked to gene expression (at the zzso zzso over the same network zzso This measure, defined for pairs of genes in a single zzso associates with overall survival outcome independent of known zzso clinical features, in several independent data sets relating to different cancer zzso In total, more than half a billion zzso in over 1600 samples, taken from nine different cancer entities, are zzso It is found that groups of zzso interactions which associate significantly with survival identify statistically significant zzso zzso Many of these zzso zzso are shown to be biologically relevant by strong correlation with zzso gene sets, such as immune function, wound healing, zzso function and zzso zzso In particular, the wound healing module zzso to an increase in zzso interactive zzso between genes for worse zzso and the immune module zzso to a decrease in zzso interactive zzso between genes for worse zzso This measure has great potential for defining zzso cancer zzso Such zzso could naturally be developed further, by drawing on the rapidly expanding knowledge base of network zzso
