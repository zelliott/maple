The aim of this zzso study was to assess the usefulness of three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso in the evaluation of global left zzso zzso zzso performance in adolescent and adult survivors of childhood zzso 

zzso zzso survivors of childhood zzso zzso age, zzso zzso zzso zzso and 38 controls were zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to assess zzso zzso global and zzso strain, time to peak zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso and ejection zzso zzso zzso zzso index zzso was calculated as the percentage of the standard zzso of times to peak strain of the 16 segments divided by the zzso zzso A global performance index zzso was calculated as zzso zzso strain zzso zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated to determine the capability of various zzso zzso to discriminate between patients and zzso 

Compared with controls, patients had significantly reduced zzso global zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and greater zzso zzso zzso zzso All except the zzso zzso segment in patients had reduced regional zzso strain compared with controls zzso zzso zzso for zzso Global zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were correlated with cumulative zzso zzso The areas under the zzso zzso global zzso strain, zzso zzso and ejection fraction were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso had sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso of zzso patients from zzso 

zzso zzso zzso enables the derivation of an index of zzso global performance that incorporates zzso zzso strain, zzso and zzso for the sensitive detection of altered zzso mechanics in childhood cancer zzso
