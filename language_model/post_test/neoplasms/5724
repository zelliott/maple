To investigate pretrial risk factors and long term mortality zzso in participants and zzso of a zzso primary prevention zzso 

A prospective study among zzso initially healthy zzso During the 1960s zzso zzso zzso healthy male business executives born between 1919 and 1934 participated in voluntary health checks at the Institute of Occupational Health in zzso From that period cardiovascular disease zzso risk factors were available in zzso zzso In the beginning of the 1970s these men were invited to join a zzso primary prevention trial of zzso Six groups were zzso zzso healthy participants in a high risk intervention group zzso zzso zzso and zzso their zzso control group zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso low risk group zzso zzso zzso zzso an excluded group with signs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a refused group zzso zzso zzso and zzso dead zzso zzso zzso Groups I and II participated in the five year prevention trial which started in zzso Other groups were followed up through zzso with no personal zzso 

zzso risk factors during the zzso zzso follow up using national registers up to 31 December, zzso 

zzso risk factors were lowest in the low risk group, highest in the excluded group, intermediate and comparable in other zzso zzso zzso mortality zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the low risk, control, intervention, refused, and excluded groups, respectively zzso zzso zzso In the whole population of zzso men, the zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso and coronary deaths zzso zzso zzso were significantly predicted by smoking, blood pressure, and zzso cancer deaths zzso zzso zzso by smoking only; and violent deaths zzso zzso zzso by none of the risk zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with total mortality in the intervention group zzso When the intervention and control groups were included in the same model, the effect of group on total mortality tended to be dependent on the 1 h blood zzso value zzso zzso zzso for the group by 1 h zzso interaction zzso 

The traditional risk factors zzso blood pressure, and zzso are significantly associated with zzso mortality in this high social class population with previous health zzso zzso a zzso of low risk factors predicted low total, zzso and cancer zzso The findings on 1 h blood zzso suggest that factors related to zzso tolerance explain in part the excess mortality in the intervention group compared with the control zzso
