zzso zzso zzso and zzso lakes in severe zzso zzso might impair liver zzso Although zzso of the zzso duct has been reported to improve liver functions in animal studies, the mechanism of obstruction differs from that in zzso This study aimed to determine the profiles of zzso zzso and zzso lakes following zzso duct zzso in patients with severe zzso zzso in the clinical zzso 

We conducted a zzso and after zzso on severe zzso zzso patients as a model of zzso of the excessive process by zzso duct zzso zzso of liver zzso were taken before and after zzso of the zzso duct and then stained by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso and by zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso All zzso were independently done by 2 zzso 

zzso severe zzso zzso patients were zzso In all patients, excessive zzso zzso and zzso lakes were zzso After zzso the zzso zzso index decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso lakes from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso duct zzso improves zzso zzso and zzso lakes in cases of severe zzso zzso similar to the findings in animal zzso
