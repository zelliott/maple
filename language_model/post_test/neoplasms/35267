zzso has long been recognized as a common feature of solid tumors and a negative zzso factor for response to treatment and survival of cancer zzso The discovery of zzso factor 1 zzso a molecular zzso of the response of zzso cells to zzso has led to the identification of a zzso zzso of zzso suitable for the development of cancer zzso Early controversy about whether or not zzso is a good target for therapy has not discouraged academic groups and pharmaceutical companies from actively engaging in the discovery of zzso zzso of zzso However, what is the best strategy to inhibit zzso and how zzso zzso should be developed for treatment of human zzso is still poorly zzso In this review, aspects related to the identification and early development of novel zzso zzso are zzso Identification and validation of zzso end points relevant to the zzso zzso is essential for a rational development of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso in early clinical trials may provide valuable information to determine the contribution of zzso zzso to response to zzso Finally, zzso zzso should be incorporated in combination strategies to effectively target multiple cellular components of the tumor zzso and redundant signaling pathways frequently zzso in human zzso
