Over the last decade, there has been a considerable increase in understanding of immune responses against zzso the zzso structures on tumor cells zzso by the immune system, and the development of more effective zzso There is, however, very limited understanding of why the immune system most often fails to control tumor growth and zzso In some patients, it is difficult to demonstrate immune responses to their tumors, and it may be assumed that this reflects poor recognition of tumor zzso induction of zzso in zzso or suppression of immune responses by zzso zzso In other patients, tumor progression appears to occur despite the presence of zzso or zzso zzso This may indicate selection of tumor cells that have lost tumor zzso or zzso zzso by immune responses against the zzso zzso cells may also become resistant to zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso used by zzso to kill tumor zzso It is suggested that development of effective zzso will need to include strategies that take into account these limitations of immune responses and zzso of tumors according to the treatment approach most likely to zzso
