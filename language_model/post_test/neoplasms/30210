In this study, we investigate the relationship between natural killer zzso cell zzso and the surface markers of cancer zzso Through zzso analysis, we found evidence that more susceptible cancer cell lines zzso and zzso express more zzso zzso Major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding protein zzso zzso molecules are typical zzso of zzso The high killing activity of zzso cells against zzso was abolished through the addition of a zzso blocking zzso Upon in zzso stimulation with zzso low susceptible cancer cells increased zzso zzso zzso leading to enhancement of zzso cell zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso activity of zzso cells is not dependent on the origin and growth style of the target cells, but is dependent on the surface markers of the target zzso
