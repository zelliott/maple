Solid tumors contain zzso and hypoxic regions depending on the distance from the zzso zzso cells may also be exposed to zzso under certain zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to associate strongly with tumor propagation and zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is stable under zzso and zzso zzso of target genes by binding to the zzso element zzso Here we investigated the zzso effects of a novel zzso zzso with a deleted zzso gene zzso in which the expression of zzso which is essential for zzso zzso is regulated under the control of an zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso under zzso and more zzso under zzso and exhibited zzso effects on various cultured tumor cells, but its zzso effect is relatively attenuated in normal zzso cells under zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso more effectively compared to parental zzso zzso treatment exhibited significant zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso nude mice in which zzso protein was zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso after zzso treatment, suggestive of viral zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be useful for the treatment of solid zzso
