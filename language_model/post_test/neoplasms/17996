zzso zzso has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and zzso in zzso zzso disorders zzso failing to respond to zzso reduction zzso This retrospective analysis was undertaken to determine the efficacy and safety of salvage therapy in recipients of solid organ transplants with progression of zzso after zzso zzso zzso 

Eleven patients who had received zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Of these, 10 had received zzso salvage zzso One patient with limited disease received tumor zzso and further zzso Most patients zzso had late zzso zzso onset of disease 145 months zzso and most zzso had zzso zzso zzso had zzso 

zzso and zzso therapy zzso complete zzso zzso and allowed long-term disease control in a patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy achieved zzso in five zzso and partial zzso zzso in two zzso zzso Four of five zzso patients achieving zzso remained in zzso at a median follow-up of zzso zzso Of the patients achieving zzso one is currently alive, and the second died from transplant rejection after converting to zzso after zzso zzso Patients with stable disease zzso and progressive disease zzso have died from zzso There was one possible zzso death zzso cardiac zzso and two patients had to be switched to zzso zzso Median overall survival was zzso months zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

zzso salvage therapy achieved a favorable overall response rate of zzso in this setting, indicating that zzso generally remains zzso after progression following zzso zzso
