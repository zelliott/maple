zzso utilizing the adoptive transfer of zzso killer zzso cells in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso can mediate tumor zzso in some patients with advanced zzso The zzso of large numbers of zzso cells was performed in roller bottles in a research laboratory setting and required meticulous zzso technique, at least one skilled technician per patient and one zzso flow hood per zzso To reduce the complexity and expense of zzso cell generation for human zzso trials we have developed a zzso automated procedure using a continuous flow blood cell zzso zzso were obtained by standard zzso zzso zzso and plasma were zzso using zzso flow of saline in the cell zzso zzso The washed zzso were zzso with zzso zzso in the original separation zzso zzso were then zzso into a collection bag where they were concentrated and washed with 2 zzso of zzso Mean recovery from the automated FH technique was zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso using manual methods in 50 zzso tubes zzso greater than zzso zzso were diluted in the collection bag with zzso zzso zzso zzso human AB serum and could be dispensed in an automated fashion to zzso bags via a sample port with zzso zzso zzso After zzso days of culture in zzso CO2 at 37 degrees C, activated cells from the bags were harvested and washed in a closed system using the continuous flow cell zzso Cell yield from the harvest was zzso zzso zzso in the automated system compared to zzso zzso zzso in the standard procedure using manual harvest of roller bottles zzso less than zzso zzso capacity of the cells against fresh human tumor in a 4 h zzso release zzso was equivalent in cells processed either by the automated or the conventional manual zzso The advantages of a closed system include decreased potential for microbial contamination and reduced labor and capital equipment zzso This technique may be easily adapted for use with other cell collection and culture zzso
