The zzso properties of naturally occurring or engineered zzso correlate well with their efficiency of cellular zzso and zzso level of cellular zzso zzso zzso are considered to zzso to the zzso cellular surface by zzso zzso and then become efficiently zzso into cells by an zzso zzso The design of zzso zzso by chemical modification of surface zzso zzso is one of the powerful strategies for enhancing cellular zzso and is accompanied with a decreased sensitivity for the zzso zzso zzso Although chemically modified zzso zzso showed decreased zzso activity, improved zzso and decreased affinity to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso contribute to their ability to digest cellular zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso can be drastically enhanced by zzso with an zzso zzso Since efficient cellular zzso of proteins into living cells is an important technology for zzso studies concerning the design of zzso zzso provided general perceptions for zzso drug zzso
