zzso zzso zzso zzso oil zzso applied zzso in a dilute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts a rapid zzso effect after a short treatment zzso zzso clearance is associated with skin irritation zzso by zzso which quickly and completely resolves upon treatment zzso 

To examine the mechanism of action underlying the zzso activity of zzso 

zzso cell changes in subcutaneous zzso bearing mice in response to zzso applied zzso treatments were assessed by flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso cells in zzso was assessed by transmission electron zzso 

zzso accumulate in the skin following topical zzso zzso treatment but are not required for zzso clearance as zzso depletion did not abrogate the zzso zzso zzso applied zzso zzso but not neat zzso zzso an zzso and zzso of zzso cells and an zzso of T zzso Although topical application of zzso zzso appears to activate an immune response, zzso efficacy is zzso by a direct effect on zzso cells in zzso The direct zzso of zzso in zzso appears to be associated with zzso zzso 

Future studies should focus on enhancing the direct zzso of zzso by increasing penetration through skin to achieve a higher in zzso zzso zzso This coupled with boosting a more specific zzso immune response will likely result in long term clearance of zzso
