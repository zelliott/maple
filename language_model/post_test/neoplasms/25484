The zzso from cancer patients lose the capacity to adhere themselves to the tube glass surface when they are incubated with zzso extracts of zzso of the same zzso type, as observed employing the zzso adherence zzso zzso zzso The authors confirm that the zzso test is zzso when primary tumors are employed as a source of zzso zzso the zzso test does not give a useful diagnostic information when zzso from zzso are zzso On the other hand, the practice of cell counts at 20 minutes zzso shows that we are not dealing with a true adherence zzso but with a massive initial adherence of the zzso to the glass surface, followed by the further detachment of the zzso The phenomenon depends on cell concentration and it is not observed when less than 1000 zzso zzso are zzso
