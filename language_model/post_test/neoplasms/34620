Over the past decade, many of the key components of the genetic machinery that regulate the zzso division of zzso zzso neural zzso zzso have been identified and their functions zzso Studies over the past two years have shown that many of these identified components act to regulate the zzso versus differentiation decision and appear to function as tumor zzso during zzso nervous system zzso In this paper, we highlight the growing number of molecules that are normally considered to be key regulators of cell cycle zzso that have recently been shown to impinge on the zzso zzso division machinery to control zzso protein zzso and/or the decision to zzso or zzso
