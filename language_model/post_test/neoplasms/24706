Like cells, all zzso have a limited life zzso Among cells there are a few exceptions zzso zzso zzso among zzso not, even if some of them live zzso Many in zzso and in zzso studies support the consensus that zzso length is strongly correlated with life zzso At the zzso cellular level, long zzso have been associated with longer life zzso A different situation can be seen in zzso cells, such as cancer, germ and stem cells, where zzso are maintained by zzso a specialized reverse zzso that is involved in synthesis of zzso zzso of zzso zzso if zzso is active, zzso can be maintained at a sufficient length to ensure cell zzso To the contrary, zzso shorten progressively with each cell division and when a critical zzso length zzso zzso is reached, the cells undergo zzso and subsequently zzso In zzso those with the longest zzso zzso zzso have the shortest life zzso Furthermore, the shorter the mean zzso zzso the longer the mean life span, as observed in humans zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which have the longest mean life span among zzso Over the past centuries, human average life span has zzso The hypothesis presented here suggests that this continual increase in the mean life span could be due to a decrease of mean zzso length over the last hundreds zzso Actually, the life span is not directly influenced by length of zzso but rather by zzso length - dependent gene expression zzso According to zzso zzso than average zzso zzso it is the shortest zzso length that makes the biggest difference to a zzso In the context of fast-growing global elderly population due to increase in life zzso it also seem to be an age related increase in cancer zzso Nevertheless, extending healthy life span could depend on how good cells zzso during the prenatal period and few years after birth, the equilibrium between zzso length and zzso activity, as seen in germ zzso After all, I suggest that decrease in mean zzso length might result in, on the one hand, an increased life span and, on the other, a higher risk of zzso
