Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective but is associated with short and long-term side zzso zzso side effects, including oral zzso remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat zzso 

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of oral zzso for patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and or zzso 

zzso searches of Cochrane zzso Health Group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional zzso Date of the most recent searches May zzso zzso 2001, issue 3) 

All zzso controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral zzso in people receiving chemotherapy or zzso for zzso The outcomes were zzso of oral zzso zzso systemic infection, amount of zzso length of zzso cost and patient quality of zzso 

Data were independently zzso in zzso by two zzso Authors were contacted for details of zzso and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried zzso The Cochrane zzso Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and relative risk values calculated using random effects models where significant zzso was detected zzso 

Eight trials involving zzso patients, satisfied the inclusion criteria and are included in this zzso Only two agents, each in single trials, were found to be effective for zzso oral zzso A drug absorbed from the gastrointestinal zzso zzso was more beneficial than zzso in zzso oral zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso at a higher dose of zzso was more effective than a lower zzso dose in zzso oral zzso when assessed zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Another trial demonstrated no difference between a zzso dose of the partially absorbed drug, zzso and zzso No differences were found when comparing different absorbed zzso and comparing absorbed drugs with drugs which are not zzso 

There is weak and unreliable evidence that the absorbed drug, zzso may eradicate oral zzso and that a higher dose of the partially absorbed drug, zzso may give greater benefit than a lower zzso dose, however, researchers may wish to prevent rather than treat oral zzso Further well zzso zzso trials assessing the effectiveness of old and new interventions for treating oral zzso are zzso
