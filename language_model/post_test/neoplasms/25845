zzso is an zzso zzso agent which zzso chemical conversion at zzso pH to the active species zzso zzso but is stable at acid zzso This study evaluated the effect of an increase in gastric zzso through the use of zzso on the oral zzso and plasma zzso of zzso and zzso 

Fifteen patients with advanced cancer were enrolled of which 12 were zzso all of whom had zzso blood zzso Each patient received zzso 150 zzso zzso zzso for 5 days in cycle 1 and also received zzso 150 zzso every 12 h either on days 1 and 2 or days 4 and zzso zzso pH was monitored by the use of the zzso capsule zzso 

Following the administration of zzso there was a rise in gastric pH by 1-2 pH units over the duration of the study period zzso range zzso without zzso and zzso with zzso There was no difference in the zzso parameters of zzso or zzso with or without the zzso administration of zzso There was however, a lower zzso for zzso and zzso for patients receiving zzso on day 1 and 2 versus day 4 and zzso zzso was rapidly absorbed zzso to maximum plasma concentration zzso zzso zzso and eliminated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed a similar pattern with a zzso of zzso h and a zzso of zzso zzso Overall, the zzso of the zzso represented about zzso of the zzso for zzso
