zzso a zzso and ubiquitous cell population representing up to zzso of the cellular content of different types of zzso are the principal cell zzso in response to zzso inflammation process, tissue zzso and repair and play a pivotal role in zzso and insulin resistance because of their capacity to be the major source of inflammatory zzso which can function through zzso and zzso zzso Recently, differently activated zzso populations have been zzso depending on a large variety of zzso signals, and it is now recognized that their zzso plays a crucial role in the development and progression of zzso There is good evidence of the ability of zzso zzso acids and zzso compounds to zzso inflammation in experimental models involving zzso This observation leaves room to the intriguing hypothesis that zzso polarization could represent one of the unifying mechanisms through which specific food components can exert zzso effects in humans, contributing to the prevention of chronic diseases strongly linked to zzso such as zzso Future studies should be addressed to substantiate this hypothesis, investigating whether or not zzso zzso of zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso in zzso On the in zzso side, the evaluation of zzso populations in zzso however complex, should be included among the analyses performed in zzso and intervention studies, in order to understand if zzso zzso is involved in the zzso activity of a specific dietary zzso
