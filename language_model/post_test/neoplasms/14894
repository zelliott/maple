Here, we examined the status of zzso zzso expression in patients with benign zzso zzso zzso primary prostate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, an absence of zzso zzso directly correlated with prostate cancer disease zzso For example, virtually all zzso samples showed abundant zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in a subset of patients with primary prostate cancer, the zzso levels of zzso were significantly zzso and this correlated with a high zzso score, indicative of a worse prognosis and poor clinical zzso zzso all zzso tumors zzso from zzso zzso or zzso were completely negative for zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso expression may be considered as a new zzso of prostate cancer disease progression and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso correlated with the zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso Thus, loss of zzso zzso is zzso of elevated levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This provides important new clinical evidence for zzso signaling between prostate cancer zzso cells and the tumor zzso zzso especially related to disease progression and zzso
