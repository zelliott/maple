To compare the short zzso exercise capacity test zzso ramp zzso with the zzso test to determine the most appropriate exercise test in cancer zzso 

A prospective study in which a zzso test, a zzso short exercise capacity test zzso ramp zzso and a zzso oxygen consumption test zzso zzso were performed before and after an zzso training zzso zzso testing, the criterion standard for the measurement of physical capacity, was compared with the zzso test and the steep ramp zzso 

Community hospital and zzso 

zzso cancer survivors (10 men, 27 zzso treated with zzso The subjects' mean age zzso standard zzso zzso was zzso zzso 

An zzso training program including strength training, zzso zzso training, and home-based activities zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso workload zzso ramp zzso were assessed during the exercise tests and compared with the results of the zzso zzso 

A paired zzso test showed a significant improvement in zzso zzso zzso and zzso workload zzso zzso after the training zzso This improvement was confirmed in the steep ramp test zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso test zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso only a moderate correlation between the zzso test and the zzso test and a high correlation between the zzso test and the steep ramp zzso zzso correlation determined the zzso reliability of the zzso test zzso and the steep ramp test zzso A linear zzso model zzso zzso steep ramp zzso zzso was estimated to predict zzso from the steep ramp test outcome, zzso a prediction margin of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso test proved to be zzso whereas the steep ramp test seems to be a zzso reliable, and valid test for the assessment of the training zzso The steep ramp test can be regularly repeated during the training program, providing information needed to zzso the training dose according to the progress zzso
