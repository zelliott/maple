This study describes the development of zzso and the suppression of bone zzso stem cells following chronic administration of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso either at daily zzso of 5 zzso and 25 zzso or at pulse doses of three times 500 zzso within 1 week followed by a time zzso of 11 zzso The total doses of the higher daily dose and of the pulse dose were chosen to be equally zzso No significant zzso activity of zzso could be assessed following either of these dose zzso With regard to general zzso as expressed by body weight gain and long-term bone zzso zzso high pulse doses of zzso were better or at least equally tolerated as were the equivalent daily low zzso
