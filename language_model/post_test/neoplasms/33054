More and more evidence indicates that zzso regulates signal zzso by modulating zzso zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso of zzso is involved in zzso and zzso We further determined the role of zzso of zzso zzso A series of human zzso zzso that lack each of the 10 zzso sites were prepared and zzso to zzso cells for stable zzso A zzso study showed that zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso underwent zzso without its zzso zzso and the zzso formation with zzso was also zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso promoted downstream zzso zzso cell growth and the tumor growth in zzso zzso These findings suggest that the specific zzso in domain III of zzso family plays an essential role in regulating zzso zzso and transforming zzso We assume that the zzso affect the zzso of zzso family, which is crucial for their zzso Together with findings from other laboratories, it is suggested that zzso controls zzso signaling by various zzso
