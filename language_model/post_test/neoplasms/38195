to assess zzso thresholds at high zzso in individuals with cancer that was treated successfully with zzso and its associations, to verify possible hearing loss as a side effect of zzso Site and date of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

Ten volunteers aged between 5 and 27 years were assessed by a clinical history, zzso and conventional and high zzso zzso in this clinical and experimental zzso 

A zzso zzso statistical analysis revealed significant differences between ears in 50% of 14 zzso that were zzso Eight participants presented hearing losses, which started at 1 zzso increasing markedly at 6 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Test revealed a significant association only with the dose and the right ear at high zzso 

It is possible that the hearing loss detected in this study is at least partially due to the zzso of zzso zzso such loss may occur even after treatment is zzso We suggest that a protocol for zzso follow-up of patients undergoing chemotherapy should be zzso
