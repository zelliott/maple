The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of impaired zzso and liver function on the zzso and zzso of zzso in cancer zzso A total of 25 patients with advanced solid tumors not amenable for standard treatment entered the zzso Patients had normal organ function or an impaired liver or zzso function zzso zzso The starting dose of zzso was 50 zzso zzso given every 3 zzso The blood and urine of all patients were sampled for the determination of zzso zzso intact zzso zzso and blood cell zzso No objective responses were zzso Five patients experienced no change and received zzso cycles zzso 6 zzso of zzso The extent and duration of zzso toxicity were worse in patients with impaired zzso zzso zzso was most zzso grade 4 toxicity was observed in 15 patients in the first two cycles of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso platinum and intact zzso revealed almost identical zzso The elimination of zzso platinum zzso zzso zzso final) zzso zzso zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was much faster than that of total platinum zzso final zzso zzso days, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso differences were observed between patients with normal organ function and those with an impaired liver function within the investigated zzso An impaired zzso function resulted in an increase of the zzso final due to a decrease of the total body zzso that resulted in a higher exposure of the body to the zzso The calculated zzso zzso was zzso correlated with the total body clearance of zzso platinum zzso zzso zzso which resulted in the dosage formula D zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso in which D represents dose, zzso represents area zzso curve, and zzso represents zzso zzso The zzso surviving fraction correlated well with the zzso value of zzso platinum zzso zzso zzso It can be concluded that the zzso toxicity and the zzso of zzso are strongly affected by zzso zzso The total body zzso of zzso platinum correlated well with the zzso zzso and the zzso surviving zzso In patients with zzso function, represented by a zzso clearance zzso or zzso zzso zzso the derived dosage formula will enable us to calculate the dose that is expected to lead to an acceptable extent of zzso in a patient with a given zzso zzso Prospective studies with larger groups of patients are needed to prove the value of this dosage zzso
