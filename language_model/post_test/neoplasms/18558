zzso zzso are frequently observed in the tumor zzso and chronic inflammation is involved in cancer initiation and zzso We show that zzso signaling through the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso generates zzso zzso through zzso dependent zzso This zzso generates zzso force in zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso to create tracks for collective migration of zzso zzso cells and provides the high levels of zzso zzso required for migration of individual melanoma cells in the rounded, zzso zzso Thus, zzso signaling can generate zzso zzso in both zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso itself positively zzso activity of the zzso factor zzso downstream of zzso demonstrating positive feedback within the signaling zzso
