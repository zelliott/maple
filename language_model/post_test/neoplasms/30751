We assessed the zzso efficacy and safety of zzso zzso solution at doses greater than 10 zzso orally every 4 hours in 24 patients with chronic cancer pain not controlled by weaker zzso 

Twenty of 24 patients completed the zzso zzso relief was obtained with doses up to 60 zzso every 4 zzso When zzso was taken for long zzso further dose increments could be made zzso The side effects of zzso are mild, and common to all zzso with sedation and zzso most zzso zzso was more common in females in all age groups and in patients of either sex less than 50 years of zzso zzso of serious toxicity were rare, and responded to dose zzso Patients older than 65 years required lower doses, suggesting zzso similarities between zzso and zzso Patients changed from oral zzso to zzso remained pain-free when relative zzso potency ratios of zzso to oral zzso and zzso to intravenous zzso were zzso 

zzso has been shown for the first time to be as versatile and flexible as oral zzso in the management of chronic pain in patients with advanced zzso
