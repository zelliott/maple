To update the mortality experience of a cohort of zzso workers with potential exposure to zzso at three plants in the United States from zzso 

zzso of zzso mortality ratios zzso with national and local rates and relative risk zzso zzso zzso were performed to assess site specific cancer risks by demographic and work history factors, and exposure indicators for zzso and zzso zzso 

For the zzso study period, excess and deficit overall mortality risks were found for cancer sites of zzso brain and other central nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and other male zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and cancer of the respiratory system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso however, none was significant or associated with exposure to zzso A previously reported excess mortality risk of cancer of the respiratory system at one plant remained increased among workers with potential exposure to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but was only slightly increased among workers exposed or zzso to zzso In an exploratory zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso and kidney cancer, we found increased zzso for some categories of exposure to zzso but little evidence of an zzso zzso A significant zzso risk zzso zzso zzso to zzso was found for pancreatic cancer among workers with cumulative exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso however, no consistent zzso relations were detected with the exposure measures considered when zzso zzso models were adjusted for time since first exposure to zzso 

The contribution of zzso additional deaths and nearly 60,000 zzso over the 11 year follow up period corroborate the original cohort study findings of little evidence for a zzso relation between exposure to zzso and mortality from any cancer sites, including those of initial zzso This is the most definitive study of the human zzso potential of exposure to zzso conducted to zzso
