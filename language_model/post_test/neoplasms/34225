Two techniques for growing colonies of human zzso cells in soft zzso have been applied to cell suspensions derived from fresh zzso tissue from 48 zzso zzso were obtained in 31 cases, with zzso efficiencies between zzso and zzso In 11 cases the zzso efficiencies were zzso or zzso There was evidence that some categories of zzso grew more readily than others under these zzso The potential applications of the methods to clinical and experimental zzso are zzso
