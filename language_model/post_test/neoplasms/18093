In the present article, we develop two zzso based fuzzy systems for identification of some possible genes zzso the zzso development in various zzso The methodology involves zzso reduction, zzso the genes through incorporation of the notion of linguistic fuzzy sets low, medium and high, and finally selection of some possible genes zzso a particular disease, obtained by a rule zzso zzso The effectiveness of the proposed methodology, is demonstrated using five zzso gene expression zzso dealing with human zzso zzso zzso breast cancer and zzso Moreover, the superior capability of the methodology in selecting important zzso over five other existing gene selection methods, zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Neighborhood analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is demonstrated, in terms of the enrichment of each GO category of the important genes based on zzso The results are appropriately validated by earlier zzso gene expression profiles and zzso The proposed methodology has been able to select genes that are more biologically significant in zzso the development of a disease than those obtained by the zzso
