zzso factors for infectious complications of central zzso zzso zzso were compared between zzso used for short and long periods to identify patients at zzso 

A prospective study was conducted over a 6 month period in two general intensive care units zzso patients with short duration zzso and in 4 medical units (110 patients with cancer or zzso infection for whom long duration zzso was zzso The first zzso inserted was followed to withdrawal or for a minimal 3 zzso 

The mean duration of zzso use was zzso and 106 days for the short and long duration groups zzso A zzso infection occurred in 6 patients in the short duration group and in 14 patients in the long duration group giving an zzso of zzso zzso days zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso group and zzso zzso days zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso care patients with a skin zzso far from the zzso zzso point had a higher zzso of zzso infection than patients without a skin zzso Taking into account the indications for zzso patients with cancer or zzso infection had equivalent risk of zzso For both short and long duration zzso use, zzso nutrition was found to be a major risk factor for infectious zzso 

zzso regular surveillance of zzso infections on central zzso should be centered on those inserted for zzso zzso
