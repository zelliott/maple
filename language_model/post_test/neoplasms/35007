The aim of this study was to determine the effect of zzso on peripheral blood natural killer zzso number and activity in 15 patients with cancer, prior to the zzso and at the completion of zzso The following observations were zzso Prior to zzso zzso activity could not be correlated with the stage of zzso In all patients with advanced disease and with zzso baseline zzso activity, the outcome of zzso was zzso Following zzso to sites including the zzso patients had decreased zzso activity compared with those receiving treatment to other zzso This decrease was not related to the dose of zzso or stage of zzso The tumor response was favorable in most patients whose zzso activity decreased as a result of zzso The decrease in zzso activity may be associated with a decrease in the percentage of zzso zzso cells in the peripheral zzso The reduction in zzso activity in those patients receiving zzso zzso may be due to the large volume of blood which transits the field, so that the zzso cells, or their more zzso zzso may be damaged and/or differentiation zzso Thus, these new observations show that zzso does indeed affect the zzso activity in cancer patients predominantly when the zzso site includes the zzso
