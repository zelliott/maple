In this review we zzso our recent efforts using mathematical modeling and zzso to simulate cancer invasion, with a special emphasis on the tumor zzso We consider cancer progression as a complex zzso process and approach it with three zzso mathematical models that examine the interactions between tumor zzso and cancer cells at several zzso The models exploit distinct mathematical and zzso techniques, yet they share core elements and can be compared and/or related to each zzso The overall aim of using mathematical models is to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that lend cancer progression its direction towards invasion and zzso The models effectively simulate various modes of cancer cell adaptation to the zzso in a growing zzso All three point to a general mechanism underlying cancer zzso competition for adaptation between distinct cancer cell zzso driven by a tumor zzso with scarce zzso These theoretical predictions pose an intriguing experimental challenge: test the hypothesis that invasion is an emergent property of cancer cell populations adapting to selective zzso pressure, rather than culmination of cancer progression producing cells with the zzso zzso In broader terms, we propose that fundamental insights into cancer can be achieved by zzso interacting with theoretical zzso provided by zzso and mathematical zzso
