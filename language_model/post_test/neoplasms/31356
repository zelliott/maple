During a zzso period between 1993 and 1995 in the zzso Oncology Unit of Memorial Sloan zzso Cancer Center, 74 patients experienced episodes of infection or colonization caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 74 bacterial zzso by zzso and molecular techniques zzso gel zzso and zzso with DNA zzso specific for the zzso and zzso genes and for zzso identified 73 zzso and one zzso zzso among the primary zzso zzso Most zzso of the zzso zzso zzso carried zzso and four zzso the zzso gene zzso The overwhelming majority zzso of the zzso -positive zzso also gave zzso signal for zzso indicating the presence of the newly described zzso zzso zzso No zzso with zzso was obtained with the four zzso zzso About zzso of the zzso strains zzso were represented by zzso zzso zzso of a single zzso most zzso of which were recovered during a zzso period between April to June of zzso The larger portion of the zzso zzso represented by close to zzso of the zzso zzso belonged to as many as 37 different zzso types, indicating tremendous genetic zzso Among 67 of the 69 zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso gene complex could be unequivocally identified either on the zzso zzso or in plasmids zzso zzso recovered from filter mating experiments using either a zzso located or zzso zzso donor strain and a single zzso strain of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso were analyzed by molecular typing zzso Seven out of 10 independent zzso recovered from the same cross showed extensive differences in zzso pattern and also in the zzso of the zzso zzso DNA zzso transferred from the common zzso donor with zzso located zzso The observations suggest that the extensive genetic diversity observed among the clinical zzso of zzso may be generated during zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso The observations also suggest that the epidemic spread of zzso in the United States may be linked to the frequent presence of zzso among the American zzso
