A zzso analysis model is presented for zzso zzso The data set is obtained from the two-year zzso study zzso database and was divided into a training set of zzso organic compounds and an external validation test set of 50 zzso The model is designed to use as a decision support tool for a defined decision zzso and is thus a zzso discrimination into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso risk zzso is based on the method for zzso human risk from two-year zzso studies developed at the zzso The paradigm chosen for this model allows a straightforward risk analysis based on historic information, as well as the zzso of coverage, probability and confidence metrics that can further qualify the zzso zzso The molecular structures were represented as zzso zzso zzso The molecular structure information was obtained as zzso structure zzso including zzso and zzso zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso molecular connectivity zzso zzso zzso zzso and counts of molecular zzso The zzso zzso software zzso all these zzso Furthermore, the zzso analyses were all performed with the zzso zzso zzso The reported model is based on zzso zzso using the zzso normal kernel method and the zzso distance to determine zzso The model performed very well on the fifty compounds of the test set, yielding the following statistics: zzso correctly classified zzso zzso zzso and zzso correctly classified as zzso zzso zzso
