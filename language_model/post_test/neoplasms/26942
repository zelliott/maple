zzso become one of important groups of drug zzso To identify more zzso being potential for cancer therapy, we developed an zzso approach for the large-scale screen of functional genes capable of regulating the main traits of cancer zzso We first employed zzso cell zzso to screen functional genes that regulate cancer cell migration using a human zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified 81 genes capable of significantly regulating cancer cell zzso Following with invasion zzso and zzso analysis, we discovered that 16 genes with zzso expression in cancer samples can regulate both cell migration and invasion, among which 10 genes have been well known to play critical roles in the cancer zzso The remaining 6 genes were zzso validated to have the capacities of regulating cell zzso zzso and zzso activities besides cell zzso Together, these findings provide a new insight into the therapeutic use of human zzso 

This team of authors have zzso a zzso cell zzso to screen genes that regulate cancer cell migration using a human zzso zzso library of zzso They validated previously known genes and identified novel ones that may serve as therapeutic zzso
