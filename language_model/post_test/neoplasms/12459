Increased physical activity has been associated with a reduction in the zzso and mortality from zzso cancer and some zzso zzso in samples of primarily zzso zzso however, little is known about whether physical activity is associated with similar risk reductions among smokers and zzso This study examined physical activity in relation to zzso cancer and lung cancer zzso and mortality in a sample of current and former smokers zzso zzso zzso 59% zzso zzso zzso mean age, 63 zzso drawn from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso a lung cancer zzso zzso zzso rate ratios and zzso confidence intervals associated with a 1 zzso increase in physical activity were zzso zzso for zzso cancer only among men, zzso zzso for lung cancer only for younger participants, zzso zzso for cancer mortality among younger participants and zzso zzso among women, and zzso zzso for lung cancer mortality only among zzso These results suggest that zzso may be more attenuated by physical activity for men and mortality more attenuated for zzso zzso may be more pronounced for younger people and may differ zzso by zzso of zzso Physical activity may play a role in reducing cancer risk and mortality among those with significant tobacco zzso Prospective studies using more sophisticated measures of physical activity assessed at multiple time points during follow-up are needed to corroborate these zzso
