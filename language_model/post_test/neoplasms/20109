A study was undertaken to test for zzso effects when zzso probabilities were zzso for zzso hazard zzso zzso were asked to assign probabilities to both probable and zzso The sequence was randomly varied so that half of the subjects evaluated probable first and half evaluated possible zzso While there was no consensus on the zzso zzso zzso assigned to these verbal expressions, in general, probable was assigned a higher probability than possible and there were specific values that were assigned zzso indicating some consistency in zzso There appeared to be a fairly constant zzso factor between the probabilities assigned to the zzso zzso was zzso in two ways: a smaller difference between the zzso when they were evaluated in sequence than when they were evaluated in isolation, and assignment of readily accessible zzso values such as 50% and zzso
