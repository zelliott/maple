To characterize the zzso zzso zzso heating zzso of zzso zzso zzso in multiple ex zzso zzso and in zzso tumor zzso 

zzso was performed for zzso minutes in ex zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and turkey muscles zzso and in zzso canine zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed by using 1 and zzso long tips internally cooled zzso In addition, zzso was performed in in zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso and human zzso cell zzso in nude mice zzso by using zzso zzso zzso Continuous temperature monitoring was performed at multiple depths to calculate zzso zzso reported as the area under the curve zzso zzso equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C zzso were used for the critical zzso zzso Data were compared with analysis of zzso and zzso zzso 

For each tissue and/or tumor type, statistically significant temperature differences (up to 14 zzso were observed at the zzso margin zzso zzso was dependent on the procedure zzso For 10-minute treatments, temperatures were significantly higher in the kidney compared with the zzso tumor zzso degrees zzso zzso and lower in zzso tumor zzso degrees zzso zzso but were similar for liver and muscle zzso degrees zzso and zzso degrees zzso zzso Thus, a wide range of zzso temperatures were observed zzso degrees zzso to zzso degrees zzso with zzso diameter zzso zzso with zzso duration and zzso zzso The zzso demonstrated an extreme range of values zzso 

The results of the study demonstrate a wide range of zzso sensitivity to zzso among commonly investigated zzso and tumor models, suggesting that further characterization of zzso end points zzso the duration and end temperature of zzso is likely zzso The zzso showed good correlation with zzso sizes, but the zzso proved unworkable given an extreme range of values for zzso
