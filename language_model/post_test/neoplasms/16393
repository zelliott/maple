The regulation of DNA zzso repair pathways by zzso and its downstream genes is an emerging body of literature, largely distinct and zzso from the zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso responses regulated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso repair of zzso by zzso and its downstream genes zzso and zzso has been zzso but much remains to be done in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso also zzso in base zzso repair of hydrogen zzso damage, still at an early stage of zzso In human zzso carrying zzso zzso in zzso especially those wherein zzso zzso occurs early, accelerated zzso by zzso and zzso DNA damage is zzso At the same time, the zzso repair pathways could provide a useful target for zzso zzso against zzso zzso having decreased ability to repair zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first review to address this emerging zzso
