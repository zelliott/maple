A simple, fast and precise method for the simultaneous determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in urine by using zzso zzso has been zzso The urine zzso is subjected to a zzso zzso step, providing a zzso sample zzso and is then injected into the zzso The zzso is forced through the respective cells of a zzso and then a zzso zzso which are connected in zzso zzso is monitored by zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso wavelength 353 zzso while zzso and zzso are monitored by zzso zzso at 235 zzso This allows the determination of zzso and zzso concentration ratios in a single run on the same sample, and the use of urine specimens collected randomly instead of 24 hourly zzso The method has been applied to urine specimens from 19 healthy, male donors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso and 23 healthy, female donors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso and zzso concentration ratios ranged between zzso and zzso
