Digital zzso represents an example of the power of zzso and provides unprecedented opportunities for molecular genetic analysis in zzso The technique is to amplify a single DNA template from minimally diluted samples, therefore generating zzso that are exclusively derived from one template and can be detected with different zzso or sequencing to discriminate different zzso zzso wild type zzso zzso or paternal zzso maternal zzso Thus, digital zzso zzso the zzso analog signals obtained from conventional zzso to zzso digital signals, allowing statistical analysis of the zzso zzso Digital zzso has been applied in zzso of zzso zzso and detection of zzso imbalance in clinical zzso providing a promising molecular diagnostic tool for cancer zzso The scope of this article is to review the principles of digital zzso and its practical applications in cancer research and in the molecular diagnosis of zzso
