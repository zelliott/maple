A model for zzso is presented that provides a framework for understanding the roles of zzso events, zzso factors, and environmental agents in human zzso and for interpreting experimental zzso This model incorporates two features: a) transition of target stem cells into cancer cells via an intermediate stage in two irreversible steps, and b) growth and differentiation of normal target and intermediate zzso zzso in mathematical terms, the model can be fitted to zzso zzso data on human zzso of both children and adults and can illuminate the relative importance of agents that affect transition rates, tissue growth, and tissue zzso This is illustrated by application of the model to a) the epidemiology of lung cancer with emphasis on the role of cigarette smoking and b) the epidemiology of breast cancer with emphasis on the roles of hormones, radiation, and zzso The nature of the two events and of the intermediate stage is considered in light of zzso conditions that zzso to cancer in zzso The modes of action of radiation and chemicals in zzso are discussed, as are predictions based on the model and amenable to experimental zzso
