Solid tumors develop zzso at spatial and zzso zzso giving rise to zzso barriers that impact zzso zzso This may increase the expenditure and time for conventional drug zzso and zzso zzso In order to facilitate drug discovery, we propose a mathematical model that couples three-dimensional tumor growth and zzso to simulate tumor progression for chemotherapy zzso This zzso model incorporates complex zzso processes including zzso and zzso zzso pressure, mass zzso zzso cell zzso and vessel maturation to model tumor progression through multiple stages including tumor zzso avascular growth, and transition from avascular to vascular zzso Compared to pure zzso models, the proposed empirical methods are not only easy to conduct but can provide realistic predictions and zzso A series of zzso simulations were conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed comprehensive zzso The zzso simulation results suggest that solid tumor geometry is related to the zzso pressure, such that tumors with high zzso pressure are more likely to develop zzso structures than those with low zzso zzso
