This study determined the range of tolerable doses, clinical safety, zzso and preliminary evidence of clinical activity following once or twice daily administration of zzso in patients with solid zzso 

Cancer patients zzso zzso zzso received oral doses of zzso ranging from 175 to 1,800 zzso once daily or 500 to 900 zzso twice zzso Clinical assessments of safety and zzso activity were recorded and blood was sampled for zzso zzso The effect of a low-fat meal on zzso zzso was assessed in a subset of zzso 

zzso was well zzso such that dose escalation was limited at 1,800 zzso once daily only by pill zzso zzso dosing was implemented to further explore zzso and was limited by zzso to 500 zzso twice zzso The most commonly reported adverse events with zzso dosing were zzso zzso zzso zzso rash zzso and fatigue zzso and with zzso dosing were zzso zzso rash zzso and zzso zzso zzso serum zzso accumulated upon repeated zzso increasing nearly in proportion with dose, and were significantly increased when zzso with food or administered twice zzso One patient with head and neck cancer achieved a confirmed complete response and 22 patients had stable disease of zzso weeks including three patients with stable disease of zzso months zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was well tolerated following once and twice daily zzso zzso exposure to zzso was dependent on the dose, duration and frequency of zzso and zzso zzso Clinical activity was zzso
