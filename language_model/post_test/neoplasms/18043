zzso is one of the key zzso implicated in various disease processes including zzso zzso zzso growth and promotes zzso in normal zzso cells and in contrast, acts as a zzso zzso by promoting zzso zzso zzso and zzso It is not clear if various actions of zzso on normal and zzso cells are due to differential gene zzso Hence we studied the regulation of gene expression by zzso in normal and cancer zzso 

Using human 19 K zzso zzso we show that zzso genes are exclusively regulated by zzso in zzso cells in contrast to zzso genes exclusively regulated in zzso zzso In addition, 267 genes are commonly regulated in both the zzso zzso and real-time zzso analysis of some genes agrees with the zzso zzso In order to identify the zzso pathways that influence zzso zzso gene regulation, we used specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that regulation of majority of the selected genes is dependent on at least one of these pathways and this dependence is zzso zzso Interestingly, an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly affected zzso regulation of zzso 1 in zzso zzso 

These data suggest major differences with respect to zzso zzso gene regulation in normal and transformed cells and significant role of zzso zzso pathways in the regulation of many genes by zzso
