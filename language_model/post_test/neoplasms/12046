Experimental screening of zzso drugs is discussed from the standpoint of the need for close zzso between zzso and zzso in developing therapies for human zzso zzso emphasis is given to screening zzso of known active drugs including the approaches in chemical synthesis and tests of experimental tumor activity, as well as the questions that determine clinical interest and capabilities for human zzso In the area of combinations of two or more drugs, the need for experimental systems providing data for rational design of clinical regimens is zzso Means for experimental evaluation of the major variables of dose ratio, dose schedule and sequence of drug administration are zzso Finally, the overall problems of drug screening are discussed within the context of combining drugs with other treatment zzso such as surgery, zzso and zzso The complexities of designing better cancer treatment will require close interaction between experimental and clinical zzso
