The control of zzso and its zzso pathways is a crucial factor for understanding cell zzso In a large zzso interference screen, the zzso gene was found to be related to zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential role of zzso as a tumor zzso zzso 

zzso expression was determined by quantitative real-time zzso and zzso in 30 colon and 20 zzso zzso and in 7 colon zzso Two zzso colon zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human zzso and zzso zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso expression levels were analyzed in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso after zzso induction by quantitative real-time zzso and Western zzso 

The zzso gene was zzso in 27 of 30 colon zzso zzso zzso zzso 16 of 20 zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and 6 of 7 colon zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso induced cell arrest and zzso features in normal zzso and zzso colon zzso cell zzso Interestingly, in these cell lines zzso zzso levels were increased both in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso partially immortalized by zzso zzso and zzso with this short hairpin zzso were more resistant to zzso zzso Finally, cells expressing zzso or zzso short interfering zzso were resistant to zzso zzso 

These results support the concept that zzso may be an important tumor zzso gene by modulating zzso induction and contributing to cell proliferation control in colon zzso and zzso cell zzso
