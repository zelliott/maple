The folate zzso zzso is a potentially useful biological target for the management of many human zzso This membrane protein binds zzso zzso with very high affinity and, through an zzso process, physically delivers them inside the cell for biological zzso There are now many examples of how this zzso system can be exploited for the targeted delivery of biologically active molecules to zzso In fact, strong zzso as well as emerging clinical evidence exists showing how zzso zzso can be zzso zzso identified using folate zzso of zzso imaging agents and zzso effectively treated with companion zzso zzso While the biological results are compelling, it is of equal importance to understand the zzso zzso that were developed to produce these active zzso zzso this review will focus on the methods zzso to construct zzso zzso drug zzso zzso with particular attention focused on modular design, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
