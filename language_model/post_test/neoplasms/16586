zzso zzso has an essential role in the interaction between the innate and zzso arms of immunity by regulating inflammatory responses, innate resistance to infection, and zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for resistance to many pathogens and to zzso and chemically induced zzso In experimental tumor models, zzso zzso treatment has a dramatic zzso effect on zzso tumors, on chemically induced tumors, and in tumors arising spontaneously in genetically modified zzso zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of both innate resistance and zzso immunity to mediate zzso zzso zzso and a cascade of other secondary and zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso have a direct toxic effect on the tumor cells or may activate potent zzso zzso The stimulating activity of zzso on zzso immunity relies mostly on its ability to determine or augment zzso and zzso T zzso zzso Because of this ability, zzso has a potent zzso activity in cancer and other zzso The promising data obtained in the zzso models of zzso zzso have raised much hope that zzso could be a powerful therapeutic agent against zzso However, excessive clinical toxicity and modest clinical response observed in the clinical trials point to the necessity to plan protocols that minimize toxicity without affecting the zzso effect of zzso
