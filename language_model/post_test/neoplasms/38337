zzso zzso stem zzso cells have been generated from mouse and human zzso by the zzso zzso of four zzso zzso However, the cell origins and molecular mechanisms of zzso cell induction remain zzso This report describes the generation of zzso cells from adult mouse zzso and gastric zzso zzso These zzso cell clones appear to be equivalent to embryonic stem cells in gene expression and are competent to generate zzso zzso zzso lineage zzso show that zzso zzso cells are derived from zzso zzso No common zzso integration sites are found among multiple zzso These data suggest that zzso cells are generated by direct zzso of zzso zzso cells and that zzso integration into specific sites is not zzso
