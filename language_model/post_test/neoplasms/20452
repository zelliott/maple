zzso technology allows the investigation of the cell status on a zzso zzso scale and has been shown to identify a given cell species by its gene expression zzso This may be highly valuable in future cancer diagnosis, because traditional clinical and pathological assessments of the zzso status cannot distinguish between zzso similar but zzso different zzso These molecular differences, however are crucial in determining the clinical course of the zzso Despite this, in the majority of cases it has remained impossible to reliably zzso molecular zzso and predict the response to therapy and the ultimate outcome for the zzso zzso technology holds the potential to zzso the diagnosis and therapy of zzso Recent developments in zzso technology and data analysis are discussed as well as examples of their application to define molecular zzso
