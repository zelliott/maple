zzso peptides have gained attention zzso to their promise in zzso delivery zzso Among the identified zzso zzso the zzso zzso has been zzso used for zzso into cells of diverse zzso However, this activity is zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe artificial zzso peptides that are selectively and efficiently incorporated into human zzso cells, according to their zzso Ten representative zzso zzso zzso peptides were obtained by screening of a random zzso library constructed using zzso zzso display technology, and some of the zzso were further modified by zzso zzso Their advantageous zzso zzso ability is zzso in an in zzso mouse model for imaging and growth suppression of zzso zzso zzso These zzso peptides are potentially useful for the efficient targeting of human zzso in a zzso zzso manner, and provide a framework for the development of zzso zzso zzso
