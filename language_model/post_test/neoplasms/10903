Cancer stem cells zzso have provided new insights into the zzso and zzso potential of zzso The discovery of zzso has provided many new insights into the complexities of cancer therapy: tumor zzso treatment resistance, zzso zzso assessment of prognosis and prediction of clinical zzso Recent rapid advances in molecular analysis have contributed to the better understanding of the molecular attributes and pathways that give zzso their unique zzso Use of these molecular techniques has facilitated zzso of specific surface markers and pathways that favor propagation of zzso - allowing for targeted zzso Furthermore, it has been discovered that a specific zzso or zzso is essential for the genesis of tumors from zzso zzso strategies that alter these zzso compromise zzso proliferation and constitute another method of targeted cancer zzso We review the clinical and therapeutic implications of zzso with a focus on treatment resistance and zzso and the emerging approaches to target zzso and their zzso in order to attain improved outcomes in zzso It is noteworthy that zzso are the only cells capable of sustaining zzso however, the cell of origin of cancer, in which zzso is zzso may be distinct from zzso that zzso the zzso
