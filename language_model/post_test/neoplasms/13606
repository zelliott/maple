One of the underlying mechanisms of zzso resistance zzso is cellular overproduction of zzso zzso which acts as an zzso pump for various zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a group of related genes termed zzso only zzso is known to zzso the drug resistance, and its zzso in cancer cells has been a therapeutic target to circumvent the zzso To overcome zzso drug resistance, we have developed six zzso zzso zzso and delivered them to zzso human leukemia cell line by a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso III zzso These zzso cells became zzso zzso with the decreases in zzso zzso zzso amount and zzso pump zzso Among the zzso tested, the zzso zzso against the zzso site exhibited the highest zzso The zzso transfer of this most potent zzso zzso into a human zzso cell line, which was made resistant by infection of zzso zzso zzso and thus possessed a low degree of zzso due to zzso expression relevant to clinical zzso resulted in a complete reversal of zzso zzso In addition to zzso transfer of zzso we evaluated the efficacy of zzso zzso transfer of zzso Treatment of a zzso human breast cancer cell line with the zzso complex resulted in reversal of resistance, zzso with the decreases in both zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso microscopic imaging of the cells after treatment with zzso showed zzso zzso that was abolished by zzso B, indicating a high zzso activity in these zzso The zzso activity was well correlated with the success of zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso These distinct approaches using either zzso or zzso transfer of zzso zzso may be selectively zzso to the treatment of zzso cells with different properties such as zzso activity as a specific means to reverse zzso
