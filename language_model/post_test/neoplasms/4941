The zzso zzso zzso is a complex zzso of zzso proteins providing both zzso and zzso cues that are important regulators of cell zzso survival, zzso and zzso We present here a zzso strategy developed to characterize the in zzso zzso composition of normal zzso and tumors using enrichment of protein extracts for zzso components and subsequent analysis by mass zzso In zzso we have developed a zzso approach to predict the in zzso zzso defined as the ensemble of zzso proteins and associated zzso We report the characterization of the zzso zzso of zzso lung and zzso each zzso more than 100 zzso proteins and each presenting a characteristic zzso Moreover, using human tumor zzso in mice, we show that both tumor cells and zzso cells contribute to the production of the tumor zzso and that tumors of differing zzso potential differ in both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The strategy we describe and illustrate here can be broadly applied and, to facilitate application of these methods by others, we provide resources including laboratory zzso inventories of zzso zzso and zzso and instructions for zzso zzso the human and mouse zzso
