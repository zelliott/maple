zzso unique zzso molecules using zzso approaches, based on sequence specificity of zzso zzso acid interactions should, in theory, allow for design of drugs with high specificity for intended zzso zzso degradation or zzso of translation of a target zzso is potentially capable of zzso the expression of any target zzso In fact, a large number of proteins of widely varied character have been successfully zzso using an assortment of zzso zzso The most prevalent approach has been to use zzso zzso zzso which have progressed through the zzso development stages including zzso and zzso zzso A small number of zzso are currently in human clinical zzso These trials have highlighted several zzso that are attributable to the chemical structure of the zzso and not to the particular zzso or target zzso zzso These include mild zzso and zzso zzso of the complement and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been related to zzso zzso leading to decreased levels of zzso and zzso Despite these zzso which are generally mild and readily zzso with available standard medications, the clinical trials have clearly shown that zzso can be safely administered to zzso Alternative zzso of zzso are also being pursued by many investigators to improve specificity and zzso efficacy and to reduce zzso In the design of zzso for zzso zzso in particular, the goal is often to enhance the zzso of traditional drugs toward cancer cells or to reduce the toxicity to normal cells to improve the therapeutic index of existing clinically relevant cancer chemotherapy zzso We predict that use of zzso zzso in combination with small zzso zzso against the target protein zzso by the zzso zzso or an alternate target in the same or a connected biological pathway, will likely be the most beneficial application of this emerging class of therapeutic zzso
