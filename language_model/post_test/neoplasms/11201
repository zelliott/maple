To identify novel, zzso cell surface proteins in cancer which can serve as targets for zzso zzso and zzso a translated version of the expressed sequence tag database zzso was zzso for transcripts with similarity to the zzso zzso zzso colon cancer zzso A novel human transcript, termed zzso was identified which zzso a putative cell surface zzso zzso which is approximately zzso identical to zzso and other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Conventional zzso and quantitative real-time zzso showed that zzso zzso expression is highly zzso as it is expressed predominantly in stomach and zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso breast or colon zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated to the zzso domain of the zzso protein and used to zzso and zzso characterize the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso specifically recognized zzso ranging in apparent size from zzso zzso present in normal gastric zzso and in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso Of 31 different normal zzso examined by zzso zzso protein expression was detected primarily in normal stomach zzso and zzso germ cells, and in the tumor cells of zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in agreement with gene expression zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be of considerable value for zzso of different types of zzso
