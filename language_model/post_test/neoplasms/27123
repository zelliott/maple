Prospective studies in Western and Asian populations suggest that height is a risk factor for various zzso However, few studies have explored potential zzso or effect modification of the association by other zzso 

We examined the association between height measured at enrollment in zzso women participating in the Women's Health Initiative and risk of all zzso combined and cancer at 19 specific zzso Over a median follow-up of zzso years, zzso incident zzso were zzso We used Cox zzso hazards models to estimate zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso per 10 zzso increase in zzso with adjustment for established risk zzso We also examined potential effect modification of the association with all cancer and specific zzso 

Height was significantly positively associated with risk of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and breast, and with multiple myeloma and melanoma zzso of zzso zzso for breast cancer to zzso for multiple myeloma and zzso zzso These associations were generally insensitive to adjustment for zzso and there was little evidence of effect zzso 

This study confirms the positive association of height with risk of all zzso and a substantial number of cancer zzso 

Identification of zzso zzso associated both with height and with increased cancer risk may help zzso the zzso
