The zzso and zzso proteins are involved in the maintenance of zzso stability and zzso zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso strongly zzso carriers to zzso of the breast and other zzso It has been demonstrated previously that zzso elements of the cellular DNA maintenance pathways represents a novel therapeutic approach to treating tumors in these zzso Here, we show that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1, is also selectively lethal with zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the selectivity caused by zzso of zzso 1 is associated with an zzso of the zzso amplification zzso associated with zzso zzso We propose that zzso of zzso 1 could be zzso exploited in zzso zzso
