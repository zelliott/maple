The introduction of zzso human zzso to the management of anemia in cancer patients has resulted in significant reductions in zzso blood zzso while at the same time contributing to improvements in quality of zzso A recent zzso of five randomized, zzso trials with zzso data revealed that, while zzso zzso was very effective in reducing zzso compared with zzso patients who were zzso were twice as likely to subsequently be zzso during zzso zzso zzso 

To further assess the zzso of this rather provocative concept, another integrated analysis was conducted with zzso data from three Canadian trials, with a combined total of 665 patients receiving zzso zzso treatments for their zzso and zzso zzso 

Once again, zzso was the most significant baseline predictor of zzso with patients that were zzso having a significantly greater likelihood of being zzso than their zzso zzso Furthermore, and corroborating previous findings, baseline zzso zzso level was again found to be a significant predictor of zzso with patients who were treated at a baseline zzso level zzso 10 zzso having a higher chance of being zzso than patients in whom zzso zzso was initiated at baseline zzso levels of zzso zzso In addition, when the total units zzso in patients receiving zzso zzso at different baseline zzso levels were zzso zzso of the units of blood zzso were received by patients with baseline zzso levels zzso 10 zzso 

These data strongly suggest that early treatment with zzso zzso could significantly zzso clinical benefit in reducing the use of zzso in cancer patients receiving zzso
