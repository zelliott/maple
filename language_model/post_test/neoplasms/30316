Cell cycle progression through each phase is regulated by zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso and their regulatory partner zzso the zzso Together they coordinate the cellular events through cell zzso zzso of zzso control due to zzso zzso activity is a common feature of most cancer zzso zzso research on small molecules that target cell cycle regulatory proteins has led to the identification of many candidate zzso that are able to arrest proliferation and induce zzso in zzso cells as a promising strategy to treat zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso have also been proposed as therapeutic targets for Multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of the zzso specifically the D zzso is seen in the majority of zzso zzso the value of exploring zzso zzso in zzso which currently remains an incurable zzso zzso zzso It is characterized by zzso proliferation of zzso plasma cells in the bone zzso zzso and associated organ zzso Recent zzso and early clinical data explore several zzso zzso in the context of zzso This review will provide an overview of the main classes of zzso zzso with a focus on their mechanism of action and discuss clinical and pharmacological implications of zzso zzso as possible therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer with specific consideration to zzso
