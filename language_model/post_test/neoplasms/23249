zzso treatment zzso will continue to emerge that promise better clinical outcomes albeit technologically challenging to zzso An important question facing the zzso community then is the need to justify the added technological effort for the clinical zzso Mobile tumor zzso is a typical example, where zzso tumor tracking zzso zzso has been proposed over the simpler conventional zzso for better zzso The zzso choice per patient can depend on a wide variety of zzso In this work, we studied the zzso tumor control probability zzso index, which combines the physical complexity of the treatment plan with the zzso characteristics of the clinical case at hand and therefore found to be useful in evaluating different treatment techniques and zzso the expected clinical effectiveness of different radiation zzso 

zzso volumes of 18 previously treated lung cancer patients with tumor motion and size ranging from 2 zzso to 15 zzso and from 4 zzso to zzso zzso respectively, were zzso For each patient, zzso treatment plans were generated to extract the zzso dose zzso which were subsequently used with clinically derived zzso parameters to zzso the zzso index per zzso 

The authors observed, on average, a statistically significant increase in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in favor of zzso There was high zzso among the patients with a zzso up to zzso improvement in zzso 

The observed zzso in the improvement of the clinical effectiveness suggests that the relative benefit of tracking should be evaluated on a per patient zzso Most importantly, this zzso could be effectively captured in the zzso zzso The index can thus be useful to discriminate and hence point out the need for a complex zzso like zzso over zzso Besides tumor mobility, a wide range of other factors, zzso size, location, zzso zzso can affect the relative zzso Application of the zzso objective is a simple and effective way to combine these factors in the evaluation of a treatment zzso
