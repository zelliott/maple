Do children born to fathers of advanced age have an increased risk of dying before the age of 5 zzso 

Children born to fathers aged 40 years or more have an increased risk of dying in early childhood due to an excess risk of fatal zzso anomalies, zzso and external zzso 

Advanced paternal age has previously been associated with adverse zzso outcomes and some long-term health problems in the zzso This is possibly due to specific point zzso a condition known to increase in the zzso with increasing paternal zzso 

A Danish zzso register study, designed as a prospective cohort study, of 1 zzso 521 live born children born from 1978 to zzso The age of the child (in zzso was used as the underlying time and the children entered the cohort the day they were born and were followed until 31 December zzso The children were censored on date of turning 5 years, date of death or date of zzso whichever occurred zzso 

Data from zzso registers from Statistics Denmark including the Integrated Database for zzso Market Research, the Medical Birth zzso and the zzso of zzso of Death was linked using the unique civil registry zzso zzso ratios zzso with zzso confidence intervals zzso were used to estimate the risk of zzso zzso The effect of paternal age was examined using restricted cubic zzso and paternal age zzso 

Compared with children born to fathers aged zzso years, a statistically significant excess risk was found for children born to fathers aged zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and children born to fathers aged zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When only looking at zzso year zzso the relative risk zzso among children born to fathers aged zzso years increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the risk in the oldest paternal age group zzso zzso rose to zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the elevated risk for children of fathers aged 40 years or more was primarily attributed to an elevated risk of dying from zzso zzso zzso and external zzso 

zzso causes of death might be zzso however, this is not likely to be dependent on paternal zzso In some cases, the biological father may differ from the father zzso This zzso is most likely zzso 

The excess risk of mortality among children born to older fathers is in accordance with the zzso The association needs further attention as it can provide valuable knowledge of the zzso of genetic zzso Also, the association could become of greater importance in the future if the proportion of fathers aged zzso years keeps zzso
