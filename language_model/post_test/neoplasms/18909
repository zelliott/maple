zzso of breast cancer often follows a long zzso period in which there are no signs of cancer, and zzso may not become clinically apparent until many years after removal of the primary tumor and zzso zzso A likely explanation of this phenomenon is that tumor cells have seeded zzso sites, are resistant to conventional therapies, and remain dormant for long periods of zzso The existence of dormant cancer cells at secondary sites has been described previously as zzso solitary cells that neither zzso nor undergo zzso Moreover, these solitary cells has been shown to zzso from the primary tumor at an early stage of disease progression and reside zzso in the patients' bone zzso blood and zzso zzso zzso understanding mechanisms that regulate dormancy or the switch to a zzso state is critical for discovering novel targets and interventions to prevent disease zzso However, unraveling the mechanisms regulating the switch from tumor dormancy to zzso growth has been hampered by the lack of available model zzso In zzso and ex zzso model systems to study zzso progression of tumor cells have been described zzso However these model systems have not provided in real time and in a high zzso manner zzso insights into what triggers the emergence of solitary dormant tumor cells to zzso as zzso zzso We have recently developed a zzso in zzso system to model the in zzso growth characteristics of cells that exhibit either dormant zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso behavior in zzso We demonstrated that tumor cells that exhibit dormancy in zzso at a zzso site remain zzso when cultured in a zzso zzso basement membrane extract zzso whereas cells highly zzso in zzso readily zzso in zzso culture after zzso but relatively short periods of zzso zzso by utilizing the zzso in zzso model system we demonstrated for the first time that the zzso composition plays an important role in regulating whether dormant tumor cells will switch to a zzso state and have confirmed this in in zzso zzso zzso the model system described in this report provides an in zzso method to model tumor dormancy and study the transition to zzso growth induced by the zzso
