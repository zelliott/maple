The appearance of zzso is the most relevant limitation of zzso It has been shown that zzso resistance zzso is frequently related to the expression of a membrane zzso zzso This protein is able to bind zzso and leads to decreased zzso of structurally unrelated zzso drugs extensively used in the management of zzso zzso The availability of zzso zzso and zzso allowed extensive studies both zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the protein structure and of its mechanism of zzso The P 170 activity may be antagonized by drugs able to compete with zzso agents for the binding or by calcium zzso that inhibit the expulsion activity of the zzso P 170 has been found in variable percentages of several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso myeloma and zzso The reported data seem to indicate that the patients carrying P zzso zzso cells should be treated with drugs that are not bound by the zzso However, the possibility of zzso the protein function and the recent reports suggesting the use of P 170 as a target for zzso could be the basis for new therapeutic zzso
