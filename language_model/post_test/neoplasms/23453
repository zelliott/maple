zzso have come to represent a significant mechanism of post zzso gene regulation affecting processes as varied as cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso As more zzso are zzso and their roles zzso it has become evident that the involvement of these molecules in cancer is much more extensive than initially zzso Several zzso expression analyses in both zzso zzso and solid tumors have shown that, aside significant differences in expression between tumor and normal states, distinct tumor specific zzso signatures zzso Additionally, the ability of zzso to mediate both zzso and tumor zzso functions further zzso their functional zzso In recent years, efforts have intensified to zzso zzso zzso especially in the context of zzso As far as the impact and the success of this approach are concerned, it is still early days, but the potential is zzso This review focuses on the important zzso that have been found to impact the zzso process, how far we have come in terms of utilizing these molecules for therapy and the outlook for the near zzso
