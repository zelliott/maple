The discovery of novel cancer genes is one of the main goals in cancer zzso zzso methods can be used to accelerate cancer gene discovery, which may help in the understanding of cancer and the development of drug zzso In this paper, we describe a zzso to predict potential cancer genes that we have developed by zzso multiple biological evidence, including zzso interaction network properties, and sequence and functional zzso We detected 55 features that were significantly different between cancer genes and zzso zzso Fourteen zzso features were chosen to train the zzso Four machine learning methods, zzso regression, support zzso machines zzso zzso and decision tree, were explored in the zzso models to distinguish cancer genes from zzso zzso The prediction power of the different models was evaluated by zzso zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for zzso regression, zzso zzso and zzso tree models was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso with multiple biological features was applied to the genes in the zzso database, and 1976 cancer gene candidates were zzso We found that the integrated prediction model performed much better than the models based on the individual biological evidence, and the network and functional features had stronger powers than the sequence features in predicting cancer zzso
