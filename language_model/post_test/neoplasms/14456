In zzso phase II study of a new zzso zzso zzso agent, zzso was studied on the human tumor zzso zzso From the results of the study using the human tumor cell line of lung cancer zzso zzso appears to possess zzso zzso zzso zzso against the 148 human specimens of various zzso the zzso of zzso was tested at the zzso of 10 zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso in continuous exposure schedule for 2 weeks by using the human tumor zzso zzso If the criteria for in zzso sensitivity was based on greater than or equal to zzso zzso of colony formation, out of 148 specimens 59 specimens zzso were zzso and the zzso rate of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso cancer, zzso cell lung cancer, breast cancer and zzso cancer, zzso An overall zzso rate against 13 different zzso types of zzso was zzso zzso zzso than or equal to zzso zzso of colony zzso and zzso zzso zzso than or equal to 50% zzso of colony zzso zzso showed almost same zzso compared to that of five standard zzso drugs zzso zzso C, zzso zzso and zzso but the spectrum of zzso activity appears to be different from that of the standard zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of zzso had no relationship with prior zzso These results indicated that zzso is a candidate for phase I zzso
