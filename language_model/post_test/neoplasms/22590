Single zzso acid zzso zzso deprivation is currently considered as a therapeutic approach to treat certain types of zzso the molecular mechanisms that zzso zzso cell sensitivity or resistance to zzso restriction are still little zzso Here, we address the question of whether zzso levels of key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1) and zzso zzso type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affect cellular responses to zzso deprivation in zzso Human zzso cancer cells of different zzso of origin exhibiting variable sensitivity to zzso deprivation provided the experimental zzso Neither the zzso expression status of the zzso zzso nor their changes upon zzso withdrawal correlated with cancer cell sensitivity to zzso zzso However, the ability to zzso zzso zzso precursors zzso and zzso for growth in zzso medium strongly correlated with expression of the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso We also observed that zzso expression was below the level of detection in all the types of zzso cells zzso suggesting that in zzso at least for them, zzso is an essential zzso zzso
