zzso of zzso DNA is one of the major mechanisms that zzso genes and regulates their zzso zzso zzso Its patterns are based on zzso inheritance that occurs in the early stages of zzso All changes in the DNA zzso levels occurring especially in the promoter region of the zzso which involve zzso as well as zzso lead to cell differentiation and growth zzso Therefore it can become an impulse that zzso different pathological processes including zzso 

The purpose of this review was to present the recent knowledge concerning zzso of zzso DNA based on recent references and zzso zzso 

Genome stability disorders could be caused either by zzso which damage the structure of the genes and have not been formerly removed, or as the consequence of an zzso zzso zzso plays a decisive role in the activity of many genes and could be a natural weapon of an zzso against the expression of foreign genetic material that degrades the original zzso zzso
