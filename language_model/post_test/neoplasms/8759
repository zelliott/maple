zzso is an zzso protein with direct effects on zzso in zzso zzso functions to regulate pathways classically associated with longevity including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression is observed throughout the body during the normal aging zzso While increased zzso of the zzso promoter is reported, other zzso mechanisms could contribute to age-related zzso of zzso zzso including zzso zzso Following in zzso identification of potential zzso binding sites within the zzso 3' untranslated region, reporter zzso reveal regulation by zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were further found to directly decrease zzso protein expression indicating that, if zzso in aging zzso these zzso could play a role in age-related zzso of zzso zzso zzso These zzso are zzso regulated in cancer cells compared to normal cells and may imply a role for zzso regulation of zzso in zzso
