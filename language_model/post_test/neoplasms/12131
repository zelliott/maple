To characterize the zzso disposition of zzso and determine whether zzso zzso rate zzso could be used to predict zzso clearance and zzso effects in cats with zzso 

10 cats with zzso 

zzso zzso rate was assessed in each cat by monitoring plasma clearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Each cat received zzso zzso zzso of body surface zzso administered as an IV zzso Plasma platinum zzso were measured via atomic zzso zzso and zzso analysis was zzso A zzso was performed weekly for each cat, and the correlation between the area under the zzso curve zzso and the severity of zzso was zzso zzso squares zzso analysis was performed to determine whether zzso could be used to predict plasma platinum clearance zzso 

For all zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso were detected 1 to 3 weeks after treatment and ranged from 200 to 8,000 zzso The absolute zzso concentration at the zzso was zzso correlated with zzso The zzso was predicted by use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso dose prescription model was derived involving zzso estimated zzso and body weight in zzso zzso in which dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso an individualized prescription strategy for zzso administration based on a targeted zzso and determination of zzso might more zzso predict zzso than that predicted by conventional dosing based on body surface zzso
