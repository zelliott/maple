The time course of mild zzso induced by zzso remains zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term evolution of decreased zzso reserve in children previously treated with a cumulative dose of zzso up to 100 zzso 

zzso zzso cancer survival patients zzso with zzso zzso in continuous zzso and off treatment for zzso months with no zzso in conventional zzso were evaluated by exercise zzso at 37 zzso zzso months zzso and 101 zzso 24 months zzso after finishing treatment zzso zzso This group was compared with 25 healthy individuals zzso zzso similar to the zzso group with respect to age and body surface area zzso All individuals underwent treadmill exercise testing according to Bruce zzso zzso were performed before and immediately after zzso 

The groups were similar regarding cardiac structure and left zzso zzso zzso function at rest at zzso and zzso The growth of zzso zzso wall thickness related to zzso was lower in the zzso group at zzso Post exercise, smaller zzso ejection indexes and attenuated changes in the zzso in zzso group were observed at zzso and zzso 

The decreased zzso reserve induced by a low dose of zzso in zzso children and adolescents remains unaffected over a zzso period, suggesting that positive outcomes in chronic zzso would be expected in patients with mild impairment after zzso zzso
