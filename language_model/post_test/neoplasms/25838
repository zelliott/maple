The identification of different mechanisms by which zzso escape from the immune system has helped to evaluate the clinical relevance of a variety of zzso changes that occur during zzso zzso Among them, changes in zzso class I expression play a leading role in the zzso environment since zzso class I molecules interact with T zzso for zzso presentation and with zzso cells for zzso of these immune zzso zzso Our laboratory has proposed a zzso of the altered zzso class I zzso frequently found in human zzso into five major zzso This review focuses on the zzso zzso found in primary and zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms that give rise to each zzso and the clinical implications of these zzso
