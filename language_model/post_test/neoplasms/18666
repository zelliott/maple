zzso organisms maintain form and function through a multitude of zzso zzso The details of these mechanisms are in many cases unknown, and so are their evolutionary origin and their link to zzso In order to illuminate these issues we have investigated the evolution of structural zzso in the simplest of cases, a tissue formed by a zzso of zzso To this end, we made use of a zzso hybrid cellular zzso an zzso model in which the zzso of each cell depends on its local zzso Using an evolutionary zzso zzso we evolved cell zzso networks, both with a fixed and an incremental fitness zzso which give rise to and maintain a zzso tissue zzso Analysis of the solutions provided by the zzso shows that the two evaluation methods gives rise to different types of solutions to the problem of zzso The fixed method leads to almost optimal solutions, where the tissue relies on a high rate of cell zzso while the solutions from the incremental scheme behave in a more conservative manner, only dividing when zzso In order to test the zzso of the solutions we subjected them to environmental stress, by wounding the zzso and to genetic stress, by introducing zzso The results show that the zzso very much depends on the mechanism responsible for maintaining zzso The two evolved cell types zzso present contrasting mechanisms by which tissue zzso can be zzso This compares well to different tissue types found in zzso zzso For example the zzso cells lining the colon in humans are shed at a considerable rate, while in other tissue types, which are not as exposed, the conservative type of zzso mechanism is normally zzso These results will hopefully shed light on how zzso organisms have evolved zzso mechanisms and what might occur when these mechanisms fail, as in the case of zzso
