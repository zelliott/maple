The development of zzso imaging technologies designed specifically for use with small animals has provided new zzso for cancer zzso Traditional molecular biology techniques are being melded with zzso imaging technologies to develop a new research domain, zzso zzso One of the most exciting advances in this research area is the adaptation and application of conventional zzso imaging techniques, used extensively by cell and molecular zzso to living zzso Using these new zzso investigators can image zzso zzso and zzso the location, zzso and duration of zzso expression in living zzso This review will describe the zzso used for zzso imaging of reporter zzso the reporter genes developed for zzso imaging with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and the reporter genes used for zzso based zzso zzso using sensitive zzso device zzso zzso of zzso zzso imaging to gene therapy for cancer, to zzso therapy for cancer, to zzso zzso to cancer progression and dissemination in zzso models, to tumor zzso promotion and zzso in conditional zzso models of cancer zzso and to the zzso monitoring of tumor responses to a variety of therapies are zzso New developments in zzso molecular imaging are discussed, and the potential utility of zzso reporter gene expression in the diagnosis and management of human cancer is zzso
