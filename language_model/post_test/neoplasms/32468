The potential use of zzso in therapy against cancer has evoked a rapidly moving field of zzso Unlike conventional gene therapy zzso zzso zzso retain the ability to zzso However, replication is restricted as much as possible to tumor cells, with the aim of eliminating these cells through viral zzso The two key issues are to improve the efficiency of virus replication and cell killing while ensuring the specificity of these activities for tumor zzso zzso zzso as such may already be usable for cancer zzso Strategies to further improve efficiency and specificity include the partial or complete removal of viral zzso The idea is that functions carried out by the corresponding gene products are not required for replication in tumor cells, but are needed in normal zzso zzso the removal of genes zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or the zzso of zzso may improve the selective killing of tumor zzso On the other hand, the zzso of the zzso death protein zzso may enhance viral spread and zzso zzso Other strategies to improve the specific zzso activity of replicating zzso have been zzso For instance, some promoters are active specifically in tumor cells, and these promoters were introduced into the viral zzso to regulate essential viral zzso Moreover, replicating viruses were engineered to express toxic proteins or drug zzso A number of these viruses have been tested successfully using tumor zzso in nude mice as a model zzso An zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso gene product, termed zzso or zzso was injected into zzso cell zzso of head and neck in phase II clinical trials, and the results were encouraging when chemotherapy was applied in zzso In the future, further progress might be achieved on the level of virus zzso but also by refining and adjusting simultaneous conventional therapies, and by zzso the assessment of the clinical zzso Recent progress has been made towards the use of replicating virus zzso in cancer zzso The goal of these developments is to remove zzso cells from patients with the help of viruses that selectively replicate in these zzso These viruses are generally termed zzso zzso Some convenient properties of zzso make this virus particularly useful for this zzso It zzso a large number of human cell types, especially zzso cells, which give rise to the vast majority of human zzso It can be grown easily and to high zzso and the creation of virus zzso is well zzso Finally, a large body of basic research has already been carried out on this virus, zzso its zzso Various approaches to use zzso as a cancer drug have been reviewed zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 2001; zzso and Kirn zzso Kirn zzso Kirn et zzso 2001; Kirn and McCormick zzso Smith and zzso zzso zzso zzso Wells zzso zzso zzso The aim of this chapter is to provide an integrated overview of these zzso
