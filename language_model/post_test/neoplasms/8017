A new zzso of zzso metabolism is described involving the zzso of zzso The cell surface zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso This zzso cascade begins in zzso raft zzso at the cell membrane zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso occurs in a series of discreet steps generating zzso chains of decreasing zzso The biological functions of the zzso at each quantum step differ widely, from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso intermediate zzso that are highly zzso zzso and zzso This is followed by degradation to small zzso that can induce heat shock proteins and that are zzso The single sugar products, zzso acid and a zzso zzso are released from zzso to the zzso where they become available for other zzso zzso There are 15 g of zzso in the zzso individual, of which 5 g are zzso daily through this zzso Some of the steps in this zzso cascade can be commandeered by cancer cells in the process of growth, invasion, and zzso zzso
