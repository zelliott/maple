zzso cancer cells and zzso zzso events in particular zzso in a rapid and sensitive fashion are important for early diagnosis and for studies on pathology and zzso of zzso zzso a smart zzso zzso zzso probe zzso able to report the presence of cancer cells and to image zzso events, has been designed and zzso zzso zzso has been used as imaging target in the probe design, since this zzso is a zzso of virtually all cancer cell zzso In the free state in zzso solution, zzso mainly exists in a folded zzso where probe zzso is zzso through zzso electron transfer between the zzso zzso zzso and the recognition group, zzso zzso Fluorescence is turned on, by restraining the zzso electron transfer, when zzso is forced to adopt the unfolded state following binding to zzso in the zzso apparatus of cancer zzso zzso provides high zzso zzso and has been successfully used to rapidly differentiate cancer cells from normal cells when using flow zzso and one- and zzso zzso microscopic zzso Furthermore, zzso may be able to zzso dynamic changes of the zzso apparatus during cancer cell zzso with possible application to early zzso
