zzso copper levels of 132 controls and 122 cancer patients (including Hodgkin's disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, zzso zzso patients, and patients in zzso were measured using both atomic zzso zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso zzso The data pairs were compared using linear zzso analysis, zzso versus zzso and all the data zzso and zzso fit a single zzso line with a squared correlation zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso revealed possible small differences, but none great enough to be of diagnostic value for individual zzso Thus, in a number of cases of practical interest, zzso serum copper levels were essentially redundant with respect to AA zzso Previous reports recommending the use and possible superiority of zzso for serum copper zzso appear not to have compared the zzso and AA techniques adequately or zzso zzso serum copper zzso may yet provide unique data in these diseases, but a more detailed analysis of the spectral parameters will be zzso zzso serum zzso levels are also zzso
