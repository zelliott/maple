This is an affinity zzso procedure for separating zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of serum on a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso at pH zzso and with a flow rate of 5 zzso The binding capacity of the column is 52 zzso zzso recovery was zzso zzso zzso varied from zzso for samples with a high percentage of zzso A zzso fraction to zzso for samples with a low zzso The mean proportion of zzso zzso was zzso for patients with zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso liver zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso could be used to distinguish zzso zzso from other zzso zzso determination of the zzso A zzso fraction in such patients showed a relatively constant zzso This indicates that monitoring zzso in patients with zzso zzso throughout their clinical course may not provide useful information additional to that provided by the values for total serum zzso
