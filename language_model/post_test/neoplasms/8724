zzso are continuously exposed to naturally occurring and industrial zzso in their daily zzso zzso zzso which are formed during the cooking of zzso foods, have been zzso as a new class of naturally occurring zzso They are divided into zzso zzso zzso and zzso The amounts and proportion of total zzso contributed by the zzso zzso zzso in cooked food are greater than those of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso acids and zzso in meat and zzso Both types of zzso zzso are zzso in mice and zzso All zzso zzso except zzso frequently induce zzso in the liver, while zzso zzso zzso in mice and zzso of the colon and zzso zzso in zzso Based on quantitative analysis of zzso zzso in cooked food and levels of zzso of unchanged zzso zzso in human zzso total zzso zzso intake was calculated to be around zzso zzso per zzso As in the case of other naturally occurring zzso and degree of exposure is small and is presumably insufficient alone to account for the development of human zzso Nevertheless, a linear relationship has been demonstrated between DNA zzso levels and a wide range of doses of zzso in zzso In addition, combined treatment with five zzso zzso yielded additive or synergistic effects in the development of zzso zzso zzso form zzso positive zzso Taking these results and current observations of multiple genetic zzso in human zzso into consideration together, zzso zzso are probably involved in the development of human cancer in the presence of other zzso tumor promoters and factors stimulating cancer zzso
