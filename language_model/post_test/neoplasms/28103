The Edmonton zzso Assessment zzso zzso is a zzso zzso symptom visual analogue scale developed for use in assessing the symptoms of patients receiving zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to validate the zzso in a different population of zzso 

In this prospective study, 240 patients with a diagnosis of cancer completed the zzso the Memorial zzso Assessment zzso zzso and the zzso Assessment Cancer zzso zzso survey, and also had their zzso performance status zzso zzso An additional 42 patients participated in a zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso score correlated most closely with physical symptom zzso in the zzso and the zzso and with zzso The zzso individual item and summary scores showed good internal consistency and correlated appropriately with corresponding measures from the zzso and zzso zzso Individual items between the instruments correlated zzso zzso ratings in the zzso zzso and zzso correlated best with the zzso item of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluation showed very good correlation at 2 days and a somewhat smaller but significant correlation at 1 zzso A zzso visual analogue scale zzso point did not zzso distinguish severity of symptoms for different zzso 

For this population, the zzso was a valid zzso zzso zzso was better at 2 days than at 1 zzso The zzso zzso score tends to reflect physical zzso The use of a zzso zzso point on visual analogue scales to identify severe symptoms may not always apply to symptoms other than zzso
