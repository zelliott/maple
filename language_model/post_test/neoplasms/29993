Various definitions are used to calculate zzso zzso As variation zzso zzso between reports, a study was performed to evaluate the impact of using different definitions for several types of cancer zzso 

zzso data for the period zzso were retrieved from the Rotterdam Cancer zzso for zzso surgery of zzso zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deaths were tabulated as zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso deaths were defined as those occurring after discharge from hospital but within 30 zzso 

This study included zzso zzso zzso mortality rates were highest after gastric zzso per zzso and zzso zzso per zzso surgery, and lowest after breast zzso per zzso and zzso zzso per zzso zzso For most zzso types, the difference between 30-day and zzso rates was less than 1 per zzso For zzso and zzso cancer, however, the zzso mortality rate was considerably higher at zzso per cent zzso per zzso and zzso per cent zzso per zzso zzso For zzso zzso and lung cancer, zzso per cent of patients died after zzso For zzso lung and zzso cancer, more than 3 per cent of patients died between discharge and 90 zzso 

The 30-day definition is recommended as an international standard because it includes the great majority of zzso deaths and is not subject to discharge zzso The zzso definition, however, captures mortality from multiple zzso although this may be of less interest to zzso the data may be valuable when providing information to patients before zzso
