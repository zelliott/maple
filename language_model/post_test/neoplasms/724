The zzso growth factor zzso transition factor zzso zzso has a key role in zzso it is implicated in zzso zzso of zzso zzso migration, zzso and zzso All of these molecular events are driven through membrane and zzso zzso and several downstream zzso zzso zzso has been shown to cross react with zzso growth factor zzso zzso proteins and possibly zzso their activity, thus zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso identification of zzso zzso might lead to new treatments for zzso zzso and improve the sensitivity of zzso targeted zzso compounds that are currently in zzso In this Review, we outline current data regarding the zzso zzso during zzso and the strategies for therapeutic targeting of this zzso We also discuss the rationale and future perspectives of the zzso blockade of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso
