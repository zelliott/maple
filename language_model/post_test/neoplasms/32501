The main objective in gene therapy is the development of efficient, zzso gene carriers that can zzso and deliver foreign genetic materials into specific cell types such as zzso zzso During the past two decades, enormous research in the area of gene delivery has been conducted worldwide, in particular for cancer gene therapy zzso zzso zzso are biological systems derived from naturally evolved viruses capable of transferring their genetic materials into the host zzso Many viruses including zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso virus zzso and pox virus have been modified to eliminate their toxicity and maintain their high gene transfer zzso The limitations associated with viral zzso however, in terms of their safety, particularly zzso and in terms of their limited capacity of transgenic materials, have encouraged researchers to increasingly focus on zzso zzso as an alternative to viral zzso zzso zzso are generally zzso in zzso They include zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides and zzso zzso The newly described zzso preparation zzso zzso for example, has shown superiority over conventional zzso complexes zzso Although zzso zzso are less efficient than viral ones, they have the advantages of safety, simplicity of preparation and high gene zzso zzso This article reviews the most recent studies highlighting the advantages and the limitations of various types of gene delivery systems used in cancer gene zzso
