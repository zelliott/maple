The expectation that zzso would be effective in the treatment of cancer is attributable to a theoretical viewpoint based upon biological zzso Cancer cells, which characteristically are hypoxic with poor nutrition and low zzso are sensitive to temperatures over zzso degrees zzso This is the theoretical basis which assures the effectiveness of zzso when used in combination with radiation zzso Previous clinical studies have shown that a combination zzso and radiation therapy is an effective treatment for superficial tumors, thus expanding the range of cancer zzso When used for deeply seated cancer, this combination enhances the efficiency of zzso It is, however, necessary to improve the heating techniques and methods of zzso Fundamental studies are now being actively pursued in respect of combined zzso and zzso However, zzso of clinical material zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso with zzso agents presents so far, zzso problems, such as determination of zzso anatomical regions and prevention of zzso
