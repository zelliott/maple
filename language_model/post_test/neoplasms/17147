This study assessed variation in childhood cancer survival by zzso status in Australia, and explored the effect of place of residence and zzso disadvantage on zzso 

All children diagnosed with cancer during zzso were identified through the Australian zzso Cancer zzso Cox zzso analysis was used to assess the adjusted differences in zzso 

Overall, zzso survival was zzso % for zzso children zzso zzso zzso and zzso % for zzso children zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Compared to other children, zzso cases had zzso times the risk of dying within 5 years of diagnosis after adjustments for zzso of residence, zzso zzso cancer diagnostic group, and year of diagnosis (95 % zzso zzso No significant survival differential was found for zzso or tumors of the central nervous system; zzso children were zzso times more likely (95 % zzso zzso than other children to die within 5 years from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among children who lived in zzso zzso zzso areas, and among children with a zzso of zzso zzso that were zzso being zzso significantly increased the likelihood of death zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso no significant differences by zzso status were seen among children with stage data zzso 

zzso in place of residence, zzso zzso and cancer diagnostic group only partially explain the survival disadvantage of zzso zzso Other reasons underlying the disparities in childhood cancer outcomes by zzso status are yet to be determined, but may involve factors such as differences in zzso
