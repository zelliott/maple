zzso zzso is a term that is used to describe the investigation of zzso in a zzso manner and includes the investigation of gene zzso zzso of this approach is its zzso and the highly zzso nature of its zzso Thus, the range of technologies used include zzso tag library approaches, such as serial analysis of gene expression zzso full-length zzso cloning and sequencing, and zzso zzso coupled with zzso or applied to zzso zzso These technologies are all complementary since they have different capabilities and attack different components of the zzso zzso regulation, promoter zzso differential zzso and gene zzso Unlike zzso sequencing, the zzso complexity of the zzso is immense, making its complete characterization zzso Instead, the strategy has shifted to the analysis of the whole zzso in a zzso cell biological framework where the fundamental truths emerge through multiple comparisons and pharmacological zzso The density of zzso data generated with any experiment allows for the assessment of higher order zzso This comprehensive data, in turn, permits information convergence across different experiments, organisms, and data zzso zzso zzso in the underlying conclusions is observed with data of such zzso Since zzso have been the most widely used technology in expression zzso for the study of cancer biology, this paper will focus on studies using expression zzso but will also touch on other zzso zzso The experience with these approaches is sufficiently mature to arrive at some zzso zzso First, although expression zzso is a useful approach for the discovery of individual candidate zzso its greatest power is in defining class distinctions using the collective behavior of gene zzso zzso expression zzso output can effectively uncover zzso of molecular zzso Second, in the hierarchy of factors that determine the expression footprint within a cell, cell lineage is the most important, followed by the activity of specific zzso pathways and further followed by the effect of individual zzso Lastly, expression profiling is an effective clinical tool that can discern zzso and therapeutic zzso The importance of these gene lists is that not only do they describe potential therapeutic targets, but they are effective monitors of therapeutic zzso
