zzso anemia zzso is an zzso zzso zzso breakage disorder with diverse clinical symptoms including progressive bone zzso failure and increased cancer zzso zzso cells are hypersensitive to zzso agents, which has been exploited to assess genetic zzso through zzso zzso Five zzso groups zzso through zzso have so far been distinguished among the first 20 zzso patients zzso zzso groups in zzso are likely to represent distinct disease zzso two of which zzso and zzso have been zzso Following the identification of the first zzso patient, additional patients were identified whose cell lines zzso groups zzso To assess their possible assignment to the E group, we introduced selection markers into the original zzso cell line and analyzed fusion hybrids with three cell lines classified as zzso All hybrids were zzso for zzso sensitivity, indicating zzso with group zzso We then marked the three zzso cell lines and examined all possible hybrid combinations for zzso which indicated that each individual cell line represented a separate zzso zzso These results thus define three new groups, zzso zzso and zzso providing evidence for a minimum of eight distinct zzso zzso
