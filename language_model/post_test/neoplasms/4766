Younger women hospitalized with an acute zzso zzso zzso have a poorer prognosis than zzso Whether this is true for patients with acute zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is not extensively zzso Using the zzso 2004 to 2007 Commercial and Medicare supplemental admission databases, we assessed gender differences in zzso mortality according to age in zzso patients zzso with zzso zzso with zzso who were 18 to 89 years old and had acute zzso as their primary zzso Patients with zzso had significantly higher zzso mortality than those with zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso Compared to men women were older, had higher zzso scores, and were less likely to undergo zzso during hospitalization in the zzso and zzso zzso In patients with zzso the zzso zzso odds ratio for zzso mortality was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso for the zzso to zzso age group, zzso zzso to zzso for 50 to 59, zzso zzso to zzso for 60 to 69, zzso zzso to zzso for 70 to 79, and zzso zzso to zzso for 80 to zzso zzso zzso odds ratios were zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso for patients with zzso After adjustment for potential zzso factors, excess risk for zzso mortality in younger women versus their men counterparts zzso years old) persisted in zzso In patients with zzso the difference between younger women and younger men was not statistically zzso however, older women zzso years old) had better survival than zzso In conclusion, higher risk of zzso mortality in younger women compared to younger men is more evident in patients with zzso
