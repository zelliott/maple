In these assessments of releases from copper smelters and zzso and from zinc plants as zzso Substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act zzso available data were critically evaluated to determine if environmental exposure to selected components of these releases poses a risk to human zzso The data on airborne levels of a variety of toxic substances near these facilities in Canada were obtained from the companies or provinces and systematically zzso Monitoring of ambient air near the Canadian copper smelters and zzso and zinc plants indicates that releases from these facilities result in increased potential for inhalation exposure of local human populations to several components of releases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Airborne levels in the vicinity of these zzso operations overlap those associated with zzso effects for zzso and exceed zzso guidelines for zzso and, near some facilities, zzso In addition, the margin between levels of zzso zzso zzso and Ni near these facilities in Canada and zzso potency for each of these metals is relatively small near copper zzso larger near copper zzso and intermediate near zinc zzso On this basis, the risk to human health from environmental exposure to releases from these facilities is considered to be high compared with other zzso Substances assessed under zzso especially for facilities where copper is zzso
