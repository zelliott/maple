Little attention has been paid to selecting and developing zzso quality of life zzso measurement tools for young adult survivors of childhood cancer zzso The primary purpose of this study was to develop a zzso tool for zzso based on three legacy zzso 

Data collected from 151 zzso were zzso zzso was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study zzso Quality of Life in Adult Cancer zzso and Quality of zzso zzso We used the following stages to develop our zzso zzso mapping items from three instruments into a common zzso zzso checking zzso using zzso factor analyses zzso and zzso items using zzso zzso 

We assigned 123 items to a zzso construct comprised of six generic and eight zzso zzso zzso retained 107 items that meet the assumptions of zzso and local zzso zzso analysis retained 68 items that satisfied the zzso of zzso fit statistic mean zzso However, items in most zzso possess relatively easy measurement properties, whereas zzso underlying zzso was on the middle to higher zzso 

zzso properties of the established tool for measuring zzso of zzso were not zzso Future studies need to refine this zzso especially adding more challenging zzso
