zzso an zzso activity responsible for the replication of zzso end structures, is strongly zzso in most human zzso In contrast, most differentiated zzso are zzso zzso The zzso step for zzso activity seems to be the expression of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by the human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso The precise mechanism of how zzso is regulated has not been zzso zzso We show here that the zzso of zzso zzso during zzso differentiation of human zzso cells is a consequence of a fast decrease in the rate of zzso rather than changes in its zzso The only zzso factor that has so far been implicated in the regulation of zzso expression is the zzso zzso Our analysis shows that another member of the zzso network, zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is significantly increased by zzso treatment, zzso zzso zzso reporter gene activity in transient zzso zzso This effect is dependent on the zzso terminal domain of zzso which mediates the association with the zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest the involvement of an additional zzso factor in the regulation of zzso expression and may provide a model for how zzso activity is controlled during the differentiation process in human zzso zzso
