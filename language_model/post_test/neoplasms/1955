This paper presents a new approach to the measurement and understanding of clinical zzso A zzso zzso zzso procedure was used to analyze zzso similarity judgments made to 9 pain zzso by 24 cancer pain patients and 24 healthy zzso The question was whether the dimensions of the global pain space differed between the 2 zzso The zzso zzso dimension was found to be primary for the patients, but much less important for the zzso Otherwise, the group stimulus space revealed broadly similar zzso zzso The zzso zzso dimension placed zzso zzso and zzso at one pole and zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso The zzso Quality dimension grouped the zzso zzso and zzso (and, in part, zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the strong negative affect pole for both zzso they zzso however, with respect to the moderate affect zzso The zzso dimension ranged from Burning to zzso The subject weight space revealed that the zzso zzso dimension was the most important dimension for the patients, while zzso Quality was more salient for the zzso Wide differences were found in the zzso of the various dimensions to different zzso this information may prove useful for tailoring patient zzso The study demonstrates that zzso procedures such as zzso in which the subjects (rather than the zzso determine the number and characteristics of the global pain dimensions, will improve our understanding and treatment of zzso
