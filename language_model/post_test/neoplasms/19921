We propose a new concept describing how zzso composed of weak zzso (such as zzso would behave when they are exposed to a pH zzso weak zzso particles will tend to accumulate zzso in low pH regions under a pH zzso zzso This phenomenon, which we term zzso zzso may provide a useful mechanism for improving the delivery of drugs to cancer cells in solid tumor zzso
