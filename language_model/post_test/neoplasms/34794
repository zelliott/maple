The zzso relative survival ratio is used to compare zzso cancer survival patterns when the population age structures zzso Traditionally, the direct zzso method based on zzso relative survival ratios has been zzso In a new method zzso zzso Arndt zzso zzso O, zzso zzso An alternative approach to age adjustment of cancer survival zzso zzso J Cancer zzso weighted observations depending on the age structures of the study and standard populations are used to substitute the patients leading to a use of weighted zzso The relative survival ratio is then calculated in the conventional zzso However, no standard error of the zzso relative survival estimate has been zzso In this paper, we introduce a zzso of the well-known Greenwood formula for that zzso This method is also zzso for the observed survival and particularly when the observed survival probabilities of the patient population differ by age zzso The traditional Greenwood formula is a special case of the method when no specific weights are used and the observed survival probability is the same in each zzso Data from the Finnish Cancer zzso are used for zzso
