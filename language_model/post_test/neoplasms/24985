In the Seattle Air zzso Monitoring Pilot Program, we measured 15 hazardous air pollutants zzso at 6 sites for more than a year between 2000 and zzso zzso variations were evaluated with zzso models and principal component zzso The potential health risks were further estimated based on the monitored data, with the incorporation of the zzso technique for the uncertainty zzso It is found that the zzso zzso was generally higher than the spatial zzso for most air zzso The highest zzso zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spatial zzso Nevertheless, most air zzso still exhibited significant spatial variations, even after accounting for the zzso zzso These results suggest that it would require operating multiple air zzso monitoring sites over a significant period of time with proper monitoring frequency to better evaluate population exposure to zzso The median values of the estimated inhalation cancer risks ranged between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the 5th and 95th zzso levels exceeding the 1 in a million zzso zzso as a whole contributed over zzso of the risk among the zzso measured and zzso contributed most substantially to the overall risk associated with zzso
