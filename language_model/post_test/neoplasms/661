The mathematical modeling of tumor growth is an approach to explain the complex nature of these zzso A model that describes tumor growth was obtained by using a zzso zzso and zzso zzso This model theoretically predicts the relation between the zzso of the cell pattern and the zzso zzso that helps to predict tumor growth from zzso cells zzso zzso The relation between the tumor zzso zzso and the cell pattern zzso is also zzso This could explain why the interface zzso dimension decreases with the increase of the cell pattern zzso dimension and consequently with the increase of the zzso zzso Indexes to characterize zzso cell proliferation and invasion capacities are proposed and used to predict the growth of different types of zzso These indexes also show that the proliferation capacity is directly zzso to the invasion zzso The proposed model zzso zzso only interface cells zzso and invade the host, and zzso the zzso dimension of zzso cell patterns, can reproduce the zzso growth zzso
