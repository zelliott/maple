Human zzso has been implicated in cancer as a growth zzso through regulation of DNA replication and growth factor activity, as a zzso of zzso factor activity, and as an inhibitor of zzso In the present study, the zzso level of zzso protein was examined in a number of cancer cell zzso Interestingly, zzso expression is elevated in a variety of human tumor cell lines compared with normal cell zzso The altered expression of zzso in tumor cells suggests it may be a target in the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment and prevention of zzso Further to this possibility, 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for the ability to inhibit zzso expression in cell zzso One zzso zzso specifically reduced the levels of zzso zzso and zzso exhibited potent zzso effects on colony formation in zzso and had zzso effects in human tumor zzso mouse models in zzso zzso decreases in zzso expression levels were accompanied by significant suppression of tumor growth in zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso may be a useful target for developing zzso as drug candidates against human zzso
