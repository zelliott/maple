zzso total cholesterol has been zzso associated with cancer zzso however, the role of reverse causation and the associations for zzso zzso zzso cholesterol have not been fully zzso We examined the relationship between serum total and HDL cholesterol and risk of overall and zzso zzso among zzso men in the zzso zzso Cancer Prevention zzso Study zzso 

zzso serum total and HDL cholesterol were zzso at zzso and zzso incident zzso were identified during up to 18 years of zzso zzso zzso hazards models were conducted to estimate relative risks zzso 

Higher serum total cholesterol concentration was associated with decreased risk of cancer overall zzso for comparing high versus low zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P trend zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and the inverse association was particularly evident for zzso of the lung and zzso These associations were no longer zzso however, when cases diagnosed during the first 9 years of follow-up were zzso Greater HDL cholesterol was also associated with decreased risk of cancer zzso for high versus low zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P trend zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso The inverse association of HDL cholesterol was evident for zzso of zzso zzso liver, and the zzso system, and the associations of HDL cholesterol with liver and lung zzso remained after excluding cases diagnosed within 12 years of study zzso 

Our findings suggest that prior observations regarding serum total cholesterol and cancer are largely explained by reverse zzso Although chance and reverse causation may explain some of the inverse HDL associations, we cannot rule out some zzso role for this zzso zzso
