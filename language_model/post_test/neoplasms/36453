zzso functions of cellular zzso molecules zzso in zzso zzso migration, and zzso of natural killer zzso cells are partly dependent on zzso by zzso We studied effects of zzso 12 zzso on expression and function of zzso molecules on human zzso cells and compared them to the effects zzso by zzso Target binding of zzso cells was significantly increased by zzso leading to an increased level of zzso formation with zzso target cells as well as enhanced binding to tumor zzso zzso also induced significant levels of zzso against fresh tumor cell targets in zzso human zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso and subsequent migration of zzso cells through zzso zzso zzso However, zzso was a more potent zzso of these functions, which have been shown to be partly zzso by zzso zzso beta 2 zzso and zzso As assessed by flow zzso zzso also induced significant zzso in the proportion or mean zzso intensity of zzso cells positive for the following zzso markers and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among the beta 2 zzso zzso selectively increased expression of zzso on zzso cells, although to a significantly lower level than that induced by zzso zzso had different in zzso effects than zzso on expression and function of the beta 1 zzso Whereas zzso induced marked zzso in expression of the beta 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had no zzso effect over a wide range of zzso In addition, while zzso zzso cells showed significantly increased zzso zzso to zzso or zzso plates, zzso cells were less adherent to zzso and were unchanged in their adherence to zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso is involved in interactions of zzso cells with fresh or cultured tumor cell targets, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Although the magnitude of its in zzso effects on zzso functions of zzso cells was significantly smaller than that of zzso lower doses of zzso were required to zzso functions of zzso and this may be an attractive feature of zzso as a potential therapeutic zzso
