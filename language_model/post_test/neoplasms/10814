Since the 1940s, chemotherapy has been the treatment of choice for zzso zzso zzso agents target zzso cells, inducing cell zzso For most of the history of chemotherapy, zzso was thought to be the only mechanism of drug-induced cell zzso More recently, a second type of cell death zzso has zzso zzso also called type II programmed cell zzso zzso is a tightly regulated process by which selected components of a cell are zzso It primarily functions as a cell survival zzso mechanism during stress zzso However, persistent stress can also promote extensive zzso leading to cell death, hence its zzso zzso in the zzso zzso have been described in cancer cells that suggest a zzso function in early zzso but a zzso function in established zzso Moreover, accumulating data indicate a role for zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso Here, we discuss some of the evidence showing zzso cell death induced by zzso agents in different cancer zzso On the other hand, in some other examples, zzso zzso treatment zzso hence providing a therapeutic target to enhance cancer cell zzso In this paper, we propose a putative mechanism that could reconcile these two opposite zzso
