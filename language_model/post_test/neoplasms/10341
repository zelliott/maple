In order to understand how a cancer cell is functionally different from a normal cell it is necessary to assess the complex network of pathways involving gene regulation, zzso and cell zzso and the zzso in its dynamics caused by the several different types of zzso leading to zzso Since the network is typically complex, with multiple connections between pathways and important feedback zzso it is crucial to represent it in the form of a zzso model that can be used for a rigorous zzso This is the approach of systems biology, made possible by new zzso data generation zzso The goal of this review is to illustrate this approach and its utility for our understanding of zzso After a discussion of recent progress using a zzso approach, three case studies related to zzso therapy, and drug development are presented in zzso They focus on breast cancer, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The discussion is centered on key mathematical and zzso tools common to a systems biology zzso
