The abnormal zzso state of tumors has traditionally been thought to be a source of treatment resistance and altered zzso zzso However, the recent recognition that this altered zzso state is unique to solid zzso gives some hope that tumor selective therapeutic strategies could be developed that will specifically target these zzso zzso into the development of drugs that specifically target zzso and hypoxic cells could represent a significantly selective zzso therapy to be used in combination with more traditional forms of zzso Newer forms of targeted therapy will rely on delivery of directed zzso growth factor zzso zzso or gene therapy, delivered via immune cells or zzso Unfortunately, zzso barriers exist in tumors that will impede the success of such strategies no matter how specific they zzso zzso to zzso high zzso pressures and defects in zzso zzso function are needed to circumvent these zzso Current methods of evaluating tumor cell zzso provide data quickly, so this information could impact treatment zzso zzso parameters are proving to be useful tools in selecting patient zzso that may respond better to altered treatment zzso Studies in spontaneous zzso and zzso human tumors have shown that the number of zzso per tumor and their intrinsic sensitivity to radiation are major zzso of radiation tumor control zzso
