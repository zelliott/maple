zzso zzso are a spectrum of biologically diverse zzso different from those seen in zzso zzso solid tumors diagnosed in children are often, and at least partly the result of zzso pathways zzso and may zzso stages of zzso zzso insight into their zzso came from studying normal zzso and fetal organ development, as well as mechanisms responsible for zzso disorders and zzso syndromes associated with these zzso zzso integration of pathology, genetic and molecular analyses of pediatric solid tumors is allowing the recognition of distinct clinical tumor zzso as well as potential therapeutic targets for some of these zzso From the diagnostic point of view, some pediatric solid tumors represent examples of clinical translation, as genetic and molecular markers are being incorporated into clinical zzso and used for tumor zzso risk stratification, zzso or disease zzso The zzso comprehensive analysis of some pediatric tumor types using zzso expression and zzso profiling technologies, and the development of experimental tumor model systems, are zzso improving our understanding of their zzso However, further and comprehensive characterization of other pediatric solid tumors, particularly aggressive or zzso cancer types, is still necessary, and should result in the development of new integrated clinical testing, improved therapeutic strategies and better outcomes for these zzso
