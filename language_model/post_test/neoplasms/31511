The objective of this study was to assess the genetic effect of occupational exposure to zzso zzso 

The influence of occupational handling of zzso drugs was investigated by monitoring the frequency of sister zzso exchanges zzso the percentage of cells with high zzso of zzso zzso cells, zzso and the frequency of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso locus in zzso cells of exposed hospital zzso These parameters were also measured in healthy donors and in cancer patients at the time of the diagnosis and following the administration of high doses of zzso drugs requiring stem cell zzso 

Our results show that zzso zzso and zzso values in zzso exposed nurses do not differ from controls, zzso patients with newly diagnosed cancer or following chemotherapy show a number of zzso comparable to those of healthy donors, but a significantly different percentage of zzso zzso cigarette smokers of all categories studied show higher zzso of zzso and zzso as compared to nonsmokers, but the differences are not statistically zzso zzso the zzso frequency at the zzso locus in zzso nurses is higher, but not significantly different from the frequency in the control group, and zzso the increase of zzso frequency is statistically significant and seems to be dose dependent in patients treated with high-dose zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso frequency and zzso percentage are not reliable indicators of exposure to possible zzso effects of zzso zzso on the contrary, our observations indicate that zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso at the zzso locus and suggest an association between exposure to zzso agents and the increase in zzso zzso
