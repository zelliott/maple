Concepts and experimental models derived from basic research have been successfully applied to the field of molecular zzso tremendously increasing our knowledge of the nature and the progression of zzso The process of zzso transition, the cancer stem cell hypothesis, and their functional association and zzso represent some of the most significant zzso The molecular zzso underlying the plasticity of zzso are currently the object of extensive research efforts, and a substantial body of evidence suggests that these models can be connected by the regulatory role of zzso small zzso zzso molecules with a fundamental role in many cellular zzso This review will highlight and discuss this link and its possible implications for the fight against zzso
