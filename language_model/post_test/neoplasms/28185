A zzso zzso of the zzso strain of minute virus of mice zzso expressing the zzso zzso reporter gene was used to zzso a series of biologically relevant cultured cells, normal or zzso including normal zzso versus melanoma cells, normal zzso zzso cells versus breast zzso cells, and normal zzso or zzso versus zzso zzso As a reference cell system we used normal human zzso versus the zzso zzso cell line zzso After infection, we observed good expression of the reporter gene in the different tumor cell types, but only poor expression if any in the corresponding normal zzso We also constructed a zzso zzso expressing the green fluorescent protein reporter gene and assessed by flow zzso the efficiency of gene zzso into the different target zzso At a zzso of infection of 30, we observed substantial zzso of the gene into most of the tumor cell types tested, but only marginal zzso into normal cells under the same experimental zzso Finally, we demonstrated that a zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso gene can, in zzso cause efficient killing of most tumor cell types in the presence of zzso whilst affecting normal zzso cells only marginally if at zzso However, in the same experimental condition, breast tumor cells appeared to be resistant to zzso zzso possibly because these cells are not susceptible to the bystander zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso could prove useful as selective vehicles for zzso gene therapy, particularly for in zzso delivery of zzso zzso genes into tumor zzso
