A tumor often consists of multiple cell zzso zzso Current zzso often target one clone of a zzso Although the drug kills that zzso other clones overtake it and the tumor zzso Genome sequencing and zzso analysis allows to zzso dissection of clones from tumors, while zzso zzso sequencing including zzso allows profiling of these zzso This opens a new window for treating a tumor as a system in which clones are zzso Future cancer systems biology studies should consider a tumor as an evolving system with multiple zzso zzso topics discussed in Part 2 of this review include evolutionary dynamics of zzso networks, zzso signals zzso zzso zzso zzso for formation of fast-growing zzso zzso tumor zzso and modeling of zzso interactions for drug zzso The ultimate goal of the future systems biology analysis is to obtain a zzso understanding of a tumor and therefore provides a more efficient and personalized management strategies for cancer zzso
