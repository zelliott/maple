As cancer gene therapy employing zzso zzso has met with limited clinical success, there is renewed interest in using zzso viruses for zzso zzso In zzso and clinical studies, various attenuated vaccine strains and engineered virus zzso are currently being tested for their ability to achieve zzso cell zzso However, significant improvements are still required in tumor zzso zzso zzso and modulating immune responses to achieve zzso effects without prematurely terminating virus zzso Recently, we have developed zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for highly efficient, selective, and persistent gene transfer to cancer cells, and found that such zzso may offer significant advantages as zzso zzso In a variety of zzso models, zzso zzso can achieve efficient and persistent gene delivery as the virus replicates throughout an entire tumor mass after zzso with initial zzso of infection as low as zzso When engineered to deliver suicide zzso zzso zzso achieve highly efficient and synchronized cell killing triggered by zzso administration, both in culture and in tumor models in zzso Further strategies are being explored to enhance the packaging capacity, efficiency, and specificity of this zzso system through the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrids, and incorporation of tumor targeting mechanisms via modification of binding zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the ability of these zzso to achieve stable zzso expression in infected tumor cells may allow therapeutic applications that move beyond zzso per zzso
