zzso contain numerous growth factors essential for wound and fracture zzso We investigated the gene expression in human zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso prepared in zzso neutral, or alkaline zzso zzso zzso prepared in buffers at pH zzso zzso and zzso were added after zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were performed with zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that 53 genes were zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed 10 significant pathways of which eight are common ones regulating bone formation and cancer zzso Eleven genes were selected for quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso based on the zzso analysis of the zzso zzso prepared in the pH zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso preparations of zzso zzso concentrates release factors essential for cell proliferation and particularly cell metabolism under hypoxic zzso The genetic response from these factors was dominated by genes associated with the same pathways observed in bone formation and cancer zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso preparation could be a zzso key factor of cell zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso of zzso zzso the zzso response of zzso cells zzso which is analogous with the observed milieu of a low pH present in wound and fracture sites, as well as in growing zzso
