Previous zzso studies of the zzso regimen zzso zzso zzso every 3 weeks) of zzso have shown that zzso clearance is affected by liver function, body surface area, age, serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of a weekly zzso (40 zzso zzso zzso schedule are not well zzso The aims of this study were zzso to investigate the zzso of zzso (40 zzso zzso zzso using sparse zzso data collected from patients with advanced cancer and zzso to zzso a population zzso approach to identify patient zzso that significantly influence the clearance of zzso when administered according to this zzso 

A zzso zzso model was used to describe the zzso zzso data from 54 patients with advanced zzso The mean population and individual zzso zzso estimates of zzso clearance were estimated using zzso The relationships between zzso clearance and 21 zzso were zzso This included estimates of zzso function in each patient using the zzso breath test zzso zzso zzso were included into the final population zzso zzso zzso models were validated using a data splitting approach with a zzso consisting of 16 zzso 

zzso relationships were found between zzso clearance and zzso zzso breath test zzso and several of the liver function zzso and zzso was best described by the zzso zzso zzso zzso + 217 zzso - zzso zzso This final population zzso model provided both precise and unbiased predictions of zzso zzso in a validation group of patients and an estimate of the population mean zzso confidence zzso clearance of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso 

A population zzso model has been developed and validated for weekly zzso (40 zzso zzso in patients with advanced zzso These results indicate that zzso activity and zzso function have an impact on the zzso of zzso when administered zzso
