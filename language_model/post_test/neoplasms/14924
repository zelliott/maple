To assess the diagnostic value of zzso examination for satisfactory processing and confirmation of zzso in zzso zzso in routine zzso evaluation and compare the results with those of conventional zzso and cell block zzso 

Body cavity zzso zzso zzso zzso received in our laboratory were processed according to a zzso protocol for the study as zzso zzso on zzso of the zzso zzso were made and a cell block was prepared from the zzso zzso after overnight sample storage of the remaining zzso at zzso degrees C all zzso were examined for the presence of a zzso at the bottom of the zzso zzso in which zzso had formed were fixed in zzso The zzso was then placed on a lens paper, wrapped and processed zzso zzso yields were zzso 

In this study, we included 600 cases of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso of samples, zzso formation was seen, while in zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso had zzso zzso zzso and cell block preparations showed zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, with the addition of the zzso preparation, the number of cases in which zzso cells were seen increased from 42 to 85 zzso with a P zzso zzso Special zzso and zzso zzso were also performed on zzso preparations in 10 difficult zzso 

zzso preparation from body cavity zzso on the second day can be used as an adjunct to zzso and routine cell block preparation to improve the accuracy and yield of the zzso diagnosis and may also be of great help for special studies such as zzso zzso
