We investigate some models of a cancer chemotherapy problem where the normal cell population must be maintained above a lower limit and a measure of the total drug use is bounded as a limit of zzso Three sets of objective functions are zzso and some zzso solutions are provided for the last zzso In all cases the structure of the optimal solution is similar, including a zzso application of drug followed later by continuous zzso
