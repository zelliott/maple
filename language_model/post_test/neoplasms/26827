zzso zzso zzso has been associated with a higher risk of developing zzso and zzso and patients with zzso may therefore benefit from increased zzso We aimed to construct a clinical zzso score that could zzso patients with zzso according to their risk for developing these zzso 

zzso cohort study using an existing clinical registry in a zzso academic teaching hospital in zzso zzso zzso zzso adult patients greater than 17 years of age presented new zzso between June 2006 and December 2011 and were included in the zzso We excluded patients with previous or incident cancer, those who died during the first month, and those with less than one year of follow up zzso zzso 540 patients were zzso zzso outcome was new cancer diagnosis during one year of zzso secondary composite outcome was any new cancer diagnosis or zzso The score was developed using a multivariable zzso zzso model to predict cancer or zzso 

During zzso one-quarter zzso of patients developed cancer zzso or died zzso Patients with the primary outcome had more zzso were more likely to have previous zzso and less likely to have recent zzso The final score developed for predicting cancer alone included previous episode of zzso recent surgery and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the derivation and validation zzso zzso The version of this score developed to predict cancer or death included age, zzso level, zzso previous episode of zzso and recent surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the derivation and validation zzso zzso 

A simple clinical zzso score accurately estimates patients' risk of developing cancer or death following newly diagnosed zzso This tool could be used to help reassure low risk patients, or to identify high-risk patients that might benefit from closer surveillance and additional zzso
