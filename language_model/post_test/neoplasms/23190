zzso zzso is common in cancer patients and to determine its zzso origin is of huge clinical zzso zzso with zzso is of diagnostic value in staging and zzso but its ability to differentiate between zzso and benign zzso is not precisely zzso 

We examined 50 zzso from 47 patients (29 men, 18 women, 60 zzso 16 zzso with zzso zzso and known cancer (24 zzso 7 zzso 5 zzso 4 zzso 3 zzso 2 head and neck, 2 zzso zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso 1 zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso using zzso This was correlated to zzso performed after a median of 21 days zzso range zzso to 23), which included zzso relative distribution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and absolute cell zzso 

zzso cells were found in 17 zzso zzso (6 zzso 5 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso were higher than in benign ones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso with a correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with other zzso or zzso parameters zzso area zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso studies were positive and 38 negative with sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For zzso only zzso zzso 24), zzso area was zzso zzso zzso 7 studies were positive and 17 negative with a sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values of zzso zzso 71 and zzso zzso 

zzso may help to differentiate the zzso or benign origin of a zzso zzso with a high specificity in patients with known cancer, in particular zzso
