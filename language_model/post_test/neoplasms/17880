zzso acid zzso is a widely available zzso zzso with reported activity against cancer cells of zzso origin and zzso Treatment with BA was shown to protect mice against transplanted human melanoma and led to tumor zzso In contrast, cells from healthy zzso were resistant to BA and toxic zzso in animals were zzso These findings have raised interest in the zzso zzso potential of zzso A comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of BA against the clinically most important cancer types is currently zzso zzso we tested the in zzso sensitivity of broad cell line panels derived from zzso zzso breast, prostate and cervical cancer, which are the prevalent cancer types characterized with highest zzso in woman and zzso Multiple zzso were used in order to allow a reliable assessment of zzso efficacy of zzso After 48 h of treatment with BA, cell viability as assessed with zzso and cell death as measured with zzso zzso exclusion showed clear differences in sensitivity between cell zzso However, in all cell lines tested colony formation was completely halted at remarkably equal BA zzso that are likely zzso in zzso Our results substantiate the possible application of BA as a zzso agent for the most prevalent human cancer zzso
