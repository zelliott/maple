The zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested for zzso and zzso depletion in zzso and human tumor cells in zzso and for its zzso activity and toxicity in zzso The cell lines used in these studies included zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer and zzso colon zzso Soft zzso colony forming zzso showed that zzso was most effective at reducing tumor colony formation when exposed continuously to cells in zzso Drug zzso which inhibited colony formation to 50% of control levels ranged from zzso zzso (for 1 hour zzso zzso zzso for 24 hour zzso and zzso zzso (for continuous zzso zzso Human myeloma cells proved most sensitive to zzso In zzso zzso correlated with depletion of zzso zzso zzso to less than or equal to zzso of control values in both zzso and zzso zzso This was routinely achieved with prolonged zzso to zzso zzso zzso for greater than 24 zzso zzso mice tolerated high zzso doses (up to zzso zzso without evidence of acute zzso zzso was not active against zzso zzso zzso zzso When tested in zzso against zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso was not active at doses up to zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso agent zzso zzso was active against zzso and this activity was enhanced by a 24 hour zzso of mice with 50 zzso of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
