The desire to improve local zzso control and cure more cancer patients, coupled with advances in computer technology and linear accelerator design, has spurred the developments of three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment plans, aiming to deliver high dose to the target while minimizing dose to the surrounding zzso can be delivered with multiple fields each with zzso modulated beam zzso or with zzso zzso This paper introduces a new method, zzso arc therapy zzso for delivering zzso treatment plans to improve the therapeutic zzso It zzso continuous zzso motion as in conventional arc zzso Unlike conventional arc therapy, the field shape, which is zzso with the zzso zzso changes during zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional beam intensify zzso at different beam angles are delivered with multiple zzso zzso A system capable of delivering the zzso has been zzso An example is given that illustrates the feasibility of this new zzso zzso of this new technique over zzso and other zzso delivery schemes are also zzso
