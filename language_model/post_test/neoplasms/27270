Research has focused on the use of viral zzso to attack zzso cancer zzso Such agents may be zzso whereas others are zzso This paper uses mathematical models to study the conditions under which therapy can lead to tumor zzso It is found that the optimal characteristics of the zzso can be quite different depending on whether the virus replicates or zzso If it does not zzso the rate of zzso tumor cell killing should be zzso If the virus does zzso the rate of zzso cell killing should be kept zzso If the virus is too zzso in cancer cells, viral spread is compromised, resulting in persistence of both virus and zzso This has important implications for choosing the correct techniques to evaluate replicating viruses in zzso A low zzso of infection must be used for zzso because this zzso the spread of the virus through an established zzso If a high zzso of infection is used, the virus that appears most efficient in this evaluation can be least efficient at zzso the cancer in zzso zzso results are discussed in the context of experimental zzso
