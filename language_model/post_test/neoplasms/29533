Recent data suggest that proper assessment of zzso is useful to predict the outcome of zzso patients receiving zzso stem cell zzso However, the results obtained in this highly selected subset of patients cannot be applied to the whole zzso zzso We evaluated the impact of zzso in zzso consecutive zzso patients diagnosed at our institute from 1992 to zzso All patients were classified according to WHO criteria and all received only conservative and supportive zzso One or more zzso were detected in 390 patients zzso at the time of diagnosis, with a higher zzso in older zzso zzso diseases were the most frequent zzso zzso while diabetes and correlated adverse events were the second cause of zzso zzso We applied 3 zzso zzso scores zzso zzso and a zzso score proposed by Della zzso et zzso According to zzso score, zzso patients had a score 0, 111 patients had a score 1 and 54 patients had a score zzso According to zzso 209 patients had a score 0, 105 patients had a score 1 and 106 patients had a score zzso With zzso score, 288 patients had a score 0 and 129 patients had a score zzso We found a significant correlation between survival and zzso according to zzso and zzso scores zzso and zzso respectively), but not according to zzso zzso The number of zzso as evaluated according to zzso was directly correlated to the development of zzso zzso and was associated to a significantly higher risk of death not related to zzso evolution zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso higher risk of zzso death did not correlate with higher zzso requirement according to zzso and zzso scores zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As suggested by Della zzso et zzso also in our experience the presence of zzso liver, zzso pulmonary diseases and solid zzso was found to independently affect the risk of death in a multivariable Cox zzso analysis zzso values from zzso to zzso In conclusion, assessment of zzso at diagnosis in zzso patients may improve the ability of therapeutic zzso
