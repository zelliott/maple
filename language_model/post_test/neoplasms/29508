We have developed a highly efficient method for utilizing zzso as imaging agents for zzso zzso zzso zzso giving high resolution images and allowing direct zzso of tissue distribution and blood zzso Our approach is based on remote loading of a zzso zzso using a new zzso zzso to carry zzso across the membrane of zzso zzso and deliver it to an zzso zzso Using this zzso we achieved very efficient loading zzso and retention stability zzso which makes the zzso highly zzso as PET imaging zzso We show the utility of the zzso for quantitative in zzso imaging of healthy and zzso mice using zzso This remote loading method is a powerful tool for characterizing the in zzso performance of zzso based zzso and has great potential in diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
