zzso zzso examination is frequently necessary for a zzso differential diagnosis of zzso To simplify zzso examination, we have developed a novel device called a zzso chip zzso zzso The chip is a panel of zzso contained in a silicon rubber plate that consists of 50 zzso zzso A tissue section slide is placed on the plate and is fastened tightly with a specially designed zzso The plate with the slide is then turned upside down, which applies the zzso to the zzso This technology allows zzso zzso of a tissue section with 50 different zzso in a single experiment, reducing the time, effort, and expense of zzso zzso In addition, it enables zzso to compare expression of multiple zzso on a tissue section simply by changing microscopic fields on a single zzso These features are unique to the zzso chip zzso The method requires no expensive zzso This device can be used in various applications in differential diagnosis of tumors and the field of cell zzso
