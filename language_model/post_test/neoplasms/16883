zzso zzso zzso that distinguish zzso from zzso zzso in human tissue were generated using a procedure that involved zzso prior to zzso zzso was achieved by injection of newborn (24 zzso old) zzso mice with extract of normal cervical tissue containing zzso zzso (the zzso Three weeks later, mice showing no evidence of zzso to zzso in their zzso were zzso with an extract of cervical tissue containing both zzso and zzso zzso Following zzso the zzso from mice subjected to this treatment showed strong zzso with zzso cells but not with zzso cells in sections of frozen tissue examined by an indirect zzso zzso zzso cells from mice showing this pattern of serum zzso were used as fusion partners with a mouse myeloma cell line in order to generate zzso zzso Following extensive zzso one zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected for further study on the basis of zzso with high affinity to zzso zzso and a complete absence of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso tests of specificity and patterns of zzso indicate that the zzso detected by the zzso is expressed on the zzso plasma membrane of zzso zzso and is a zzso with an apparent molecular weight of 49 zzso Both zzso and zzso methods demonstrated the expression of the zzso on zzso zzso but not on zzso zzso from several sources, underlining the usefulness of zzso approach for generating zzso with particular specificity zzso
