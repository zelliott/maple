In the current work, the concepts of biologically adapted zzso of hypoxic zzso in a framework encompassing functional zzso imaging, zzso control predictions, inverse treatment planning and intensity modulated zzso zzso were zzso Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso of a spontaneous zzso in the zzso region of a dog was zzso The zzso concentration in the zzso was assumed related to the oxygen tension and compared to zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso images derived from the MR analysis, the zzso was divided into four compartments by a zzso zzso zzso structure sets for zzso planning could be derived zzso In order to display the possible advantages of zzso zzso doses, dose zzso among the four zzso compartments was zzso The dose zzso was constrained by keeping the average dose to the zzso equal to a conventional target zzso The zzso doses yielding optimum zzso control probability zzso were used as input in an inverse planning system, where the planning basis was the zzso zzso images from the MR zzso Uniform zzso and zzso zzso plans were scored both physically and zzso The consequences of random and systematic errors in the zzso images were zzso The zzso frequency zzso of the zzso concentration and the zzso zzso zzso were not significantly zzso zzso of the zzso had, according to the MR analysis, zzso values of less than 5 zzso zzso The optimum zzso following a zzso dose prescription was about four times higher than that following a uniform dose zzso The zzso zzso dose distribution resulting from the inverse planning gave a three times higher zzso than that of the uniform zzso The zzso and the zzso plan quality depended on zzso parameters defined in the inverse planning procedure zzso and zzso intensity zzso zzso random and systematic errors in the zzso images reduced the zzso for the zzso dose zzso In conclusion, improved zzso control of hypoxic zzso by dose zzso may be expected following zzso imaging, zzso control predictions, inverse treatment planning and zzso
