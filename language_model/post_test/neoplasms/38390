The zzso of Growth 1 zzso gene has been identified and characterized as a zzso tumor zzso gene zzso zzso 4 additional members of the family were identified by zzso zzso ING proteins contain a nuclear zzso sequence zzso and a plant zzso domain zzso finger motif in their zzso These proteins are involved in numerous signaling pathways especially in 2 tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso In human tumors, several studies have shown that the expression of zzso is frequently lost or zzso It occurs most frequently at the zzso level, and thus zzso mechanism could be zzso We zzso the current knowledge on ING proteins functions and their involvement in various signaling zzso We also review the studies that have investigated the ING protein status in human zzso The interest of ING proteins as zzso and their role in tumor initiation and progression is zzso
