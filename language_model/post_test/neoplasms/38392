zzso zzso zzso zzso are emerging as a new class of therapeutic agents with potent zzso activities in a broad spectrum of human zzso In this study, the in zzso plasma stability, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso as zzso and zzso were evaluated and compared to zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the compounds zzso high zzso in zzso zzso zzso but lower in PBS zzso zzso than zzso Moreover, zzso zzso exhibited higher zzso values compared to zzso The zzso of these compounds was evaluated using the zzso cell zzso as a model of the zzso zzso The zzso studies revealed that the compounds zzso and zzso are highly permeable with apparent zzso zzso zzso in the zzso to zzso direction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The in zzso stability was determined in human, zzso zzso and rat zzso Data showed that the compound zzso is more stable in human and rat plasma and the zzso is more stable in all plasma species than zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the zzso zzso possess favorable zzso zzso zzso and plasma stability zzso
