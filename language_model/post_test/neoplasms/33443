This paper describes the zzso activities of cholesterol derivatives such as cholesterol, sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and human cancer cell zzso Among the compounds tested, compounds 2 and 6 revealed themselves to be potent zzso of animal zzso and the zzso values for zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 3 and 6 inhibited the activity of human zzso II, with zzso values of zzso zzso and 120 zzso zzso zzso 2, 3 and 6 also suppressed human cancer cell zzso leukemia cell line, zzso growth, and zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, suggesting that cell growth zzso had the same tendency as the zzso of zzso rather than zzso zzso 2 and 6 arrested the cells in S and zzso zzso compound 3 arrested the cells in the zzso phase, and these compounds also increased zzso phase in the cell zzso These results suggested that the effect of cell cycle arrest might be effective on both zzso and zzso zzso From these findings, the action mode of cholesterol derivatives as zzso compounds is zzso
