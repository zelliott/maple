We have compared different methods of preparation of zzso cells for two-dimensional zzso zzso We found all methods using fresh tissue to be superior compared to methods using frozen zzso Our results indicate that zzso methods of preparation of tumor cells, including fine needle zzso scraping and zzso have advantages over methods using zzso extraction of zzso zzso methods are zzso appear to reduce loss of high molecular protein species, and alleviate the necessity of separating viable and zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso Using these techniques, high-quality zzso maps were derived from tumors of the lung and zzso In the resulting zzso patterns, heat shock zzso zzso zzso and intermediate filament were zzso We conclude that zzso extraction of zzso cells from fresh tumor tissue improves the possibilities that these techniques may be useful in clinical zzso
