Resistance to chemotherapy is responsible for a failure of current treatment regimens in cancer zzso We have reported previously that the zzso protein zzso regulates expression of the zzso gene zzso which plays a major role in the development of a zzso zzso zzso zzso predicts drug resistance and patient outcome in breast zzso Thus, zzso is a promising target for new therapeutic approaches to defeat zzso zzso In drug-resistant cancer cells and in zzso cells zzso is found in the zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso cells is a function of the E1 region, and we have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso or zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso replicate efficiently in zzso zzso cancer cells and induce an zzso zzso effect resulting in host cell zzso Thus, zzso zzso are a previously zzso zzso system for a selective elimination of zzso cancer zzso Our work forms the basis for the development of novel zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso diseases in the clinical zzso
