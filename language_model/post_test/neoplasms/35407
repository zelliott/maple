The standard design for phase I trials of combined chemotherapy and radiation, which enters either three or six patients per dose level, has little statistical basis and is subject to opening and closing because of delayed zzso that disrupt patient zzso We compared the operating characteristics of this standard design and the zzso continual reassessment method zzso for zzso trials of combination chemotherapy and zzso 

The operating characteristics were determined by zzso Carlo simulation of 60,000 phase I zzso 

Compared with the standard trial design, in studies with delayed toxicity zzso where four or more patients are expected to enter onto the study during a single previously enrolled patient's observation for zzso zzso trials are significantly shorter when toxicity observation times are long, treat more patients at or above the zzso dose, identify the zzso dose zzso more accurately, and provide phase II information, but do not expose patients to significant additional zzso zzso precision and overdose control of zzso increase as the design assumptions more closely resemble the true state of nature, but are reduced if, for instance, the toxicity of treatment has been zzso zzso 

Compared with the standard design, if there is any prior knowledge concerning the toxicity profile of a treatment, zzso can leverage it to produce more accurate estimates of the zzso and does not expose patients to significant excess risk, but requires timely communication between clinical investigators, data managers, and study zzso
