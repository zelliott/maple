To analyze factors that affect the collection of zzso stem cells zzso before transplant and the tempo of zzso after zzso 

A consecutive series of 243 patients with breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso or other zzso zzso zzso 34) had zzso collected following stimulation with zzso factors zzso or after chemotherapy followed by zzso zzso of zzso was performed following zzso chemotherapy with chemotherapy with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered to 72 zzso An analysis of factors that influence zzso cell yield was performed by linear zzso Cox zzso analysis was used to determine factors that affect the zzso of zzso and zzso recovery following infusion of zzso 

zzso with chemotherapy followed by zzso a diagnosis of breast cancer, absence of zzso disease, no prior history of radiation therapy, and fewer cycles of zzso chemotherapy were associated with a higher average daily yield of zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, the zzso content of infused cells and the use of a zzso zzso influenced zzso recovery after infusion of zzso zzso content was also important for predicting zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso was associated with a significant delay in zzso recovery in patients who received less than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but there was no zzso effect in patients who received greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Disease status and prior treatment influence the ability to mobilize zzso zzso cell dose is an important predictor of zzso zzso after zzso zzso regardless of disease or zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso improves zzso recovery, but at low zzso doses can delay zzso zzso
