People affected by cancer want information about their prognosis but clinicians have trouble zzso and talking about zzso We sought to determine the nature and accuracy of medical zzso estimates of life expectancy in newly referred patients with incurable zzso With reference to each patient, medical zzso estimated how long they thought 90, 50, and zzso of similar patients would zzso These proportions were chosen to reflect worst case, predicted, and best case scenarios suitable for zzso After a median follow-up of 35 months, 86 of the 102 patients had died with an observed median survival of 12 zzso zzso estimates of each patient's worst case, predicted and best case scenarios were zzso zzso of patients lived for fewer months than estimated for the worst zzso of similar zzso 50% lived for at least as long as estimated for 50% of similar patients zzso zzso and zzso lived for more months than estimated for the best zzso of similar zzso zzso estimates of each patient's predicted survival were zzso zzso were within zzso times the patient's actual survival, zzso were too optimistic zzso times the actual zzso and zzso were too pessimistic zzso times the actual zzso The proportions of patients with actual survival times bounded by simple multiples of their predicted survival were as zzso zzso between half to double their predicted, zzso at least three to four times their predicted, and zzso no more than zzso of their zzso similar to the proportions in an exponential distribution (about zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso based on simple multiples of the predicted survival time appropriately convey prognosis and its uncertainty in newly referred people with incurable zzso
