zzso studies with zzso tumor models have demonstrated that zzso tumor cell vaccines engineered to zzso certain zzso in a zzso fashion elicit systemic immune responses capable of eliminating small amounts of established zzso These results have engendered much interest in developing this strategy for gene therapy of human zzso The major limitation to creating genetically modified zzso human tumor vaccines is efficient gene transfer into primary tumor zzso since the majority of human tumors fail to zzso in long-term zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with short-term culture techniques, we have zzso in the absence of selection, a mean zzso efficiency of zzso in primary zzso zzso and pancreatic tumor zzso and we have developed an zzso zzso zzso factor zzso tumor vaccine for clinical zzso
