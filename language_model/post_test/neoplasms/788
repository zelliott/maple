zzso zzso were the extremely common zzso tumors, in which zzso zzso zzso zzso were the most prevalent zzso zzso representing zzso of all zzso zzso It was still a dilemma to discriminate zzso and benign zzso zzso With a new molecular zzso technology of zzso zzso probe amplification zzso we investigated 13 zzso and 14 benign zzso tissue zzso The results showed that zzso had more genetic copy number zzso than benign zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso curve analysis suggested that zzso aberrations would provide a moderate accuracy method to discriminate zzso and benign zzso The gain of zzso 13 zzso gene obviously identified the great difference between zzso and benign zzso zzso also confirmed significantly higher zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The current study showed that zzso should be an effective method to diagnose zzso and benign zzso zzso and also provided a clue to another relationship between zzso and zzso
