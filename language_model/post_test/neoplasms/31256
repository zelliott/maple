The identification and characterization of many tumor zzso and the parallel explosion of knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of zzso recognition by the immune system have given renewed hopes that zzso could be a promising zzso to treat certain zzso Many different novel strategies have been developed to derive genetically modified tumor cells and use them as cellular vaccines to induce useful zzso immunity in a variety of animal tumor zzso This review discusses induction of tumor immunity by injecting tumor cells that are genetically engineered to zzso various zzso and to express major zzso complex molecules and/or zzso zzso While there has been a great success in inducing excellent zzso immunity in a variety of tumor models, there are some difficulties and limitations in the application of these zzso tumor cells for the treatment of zzso zzso A number of improvements and modifications are already zzso to overcome some of these zzso
