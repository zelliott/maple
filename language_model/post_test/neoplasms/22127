The aim of the current study was to investigate the feasibility of real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Between 2003 and 2005, 53 patients with suspicious zzso zzso or solid zzso underwent zzso zzso core needle biopsy using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results were documented zzso and compared to a matched series of 53 conventional zzso zzso core zzso 

zzso zzso biopsy can be performed using zzso views or a combination of zzso and rendered zzso Assessment of additional zzso images during the biopsy procedure was helpful in 34 % of the zzso In the differentiation of zzso and benign zzso zzso ultrasound guided biopsy yielded 35 zzso results, 12 zzso results and 5 zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of zzso was zzso % and zzso zzso respectively zzso group: zzso % and zzso zzso There was one case of insufficient tissue sampling in the zzso targeting group and 2 cases in the control zzso No complications were observed related to the biopsy zzso 

zzso zzso biopsy is feasible and can improve zzso of biopsy procedures by zzso display or zzso zzso Although the accuracy is comparable to that of conventional zzso zzso this technique may be helpful for biopsy of zzso with close relation to relevant anatomical zzso
