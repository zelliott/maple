zzso of patient samples is an important aspect of cancer diagnosis and zzso The support zzso machine zzso has been successfully applied to zzso cancer diagnosis zzso However, one weakness of the zzso is that given a tumor sample, it only predicts a cancer class label but does not provide any estimate of the underlying zzso We propose penalized zzso zzso zzso as an alternative to the zzso for the zzso cancer diagnosis zzso We show that when using the same set of zzso zzso and the zzso perform similarly in cancer zzso but zzso has the advantage of additionally providing an estimate of the underlying zzso Often a primary goal in zzso cancer diagnosis is to identify the genes responsible for the zzso rather than class zzso We consider two gene selection methods in this paper, zzso ranking zzso and zzso feature elimination zzso zzso results indicate that zzso combined with zzso tends to select fewer genes than other methods and also performs well in both zzso and test zzso A fast zzso for solving zzso is also zzso
