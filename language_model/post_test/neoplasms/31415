The peak scatter factor zzso for a zzso beam is defined as the ratio of the total dose and the primary dose at the depth of dose zzso The values of the zzso for zzso beams ranging from zzso to 24 zzso are calculated using the zzso zzso Carlo technique, to avoid measurement zzso The calculation shows that the effect of zzso on zzso for high energy zzso beams is not significant for small fields, but can be as high as zzso for large zzso For the zzso zzso the calculation agrees with the data tabulated on zzso zzso 25 to within zzso The zzso value zzso of 10 zzso 10 zzso for zzso is zzso lower than the present value due to the zzso of zzso from the source capsule and zzso For a given field size, zzso is varied by up to zzso when beam quality changes from zzso to 24 zzso For zzso zzso the values of zzso zzso 25 (which are assumed to be the same for beams ranging from zzso to 50 zzso agree well with the present calculation for small field sizes, but are higher than our data by up to zzso for large field zzso The presently calculated zzso are related to field zzso by an empirical zzso zzso zzso 1 + zzso + zzso where m and zzso are the fitting zzso This equation describes the zzso within zzso zzso on zzso
