A simple method of using zzso blood zzso zzso monitors to estimate blood zzso values after high-dose intravenous zzso zzso infusion is evaluated as a substitution for zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso 

In 33 participants, readings from zzso monitors were taken before and after IV zzso infusions at various time points, with the zzso zzso readings zzso from the baseline zzso zzso The results of the zzso zzso were correlated with zzso zzso detected by zzso zzso 

A linear zzso was found between zzso zzso detected by the zzso method zzso and by zzso zzso The linear correlations were identical in healthy subjects, diabetic subjects, and cancer zzso Analysis of zzso obtained an zzso ratio of zzso with a zzso confidence zzso of zzso zzso The corrections of zzso improved similarity to zzso but did not significantly differ from the zzso zzso 

The zzso method can be used as an approximate zzso of high blood zzso concentration after IV zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso without zzso However, this measurement is not accurate in detecting lower or baseline blood zzso It is also important to highlight that in regard to zzso monitoring, zzso readings will be erroneously elevated following IV zzso use and insulin should not be administered to patients based on these zzso
