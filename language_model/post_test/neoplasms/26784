The purpose of our study was to analyze the effect of zzso location and zzso appearance on CT on the positive zzso value zzso for zzso of all zzso zzso that were zzso avid on zzso and that were zzso under imaging zzso 

Between January 2004 and December 2010, 227 patients underwent zzso biopsy of 231 zzso zzso zzso with diagnostic zzso zzso The PET zzso for zzso was zzso calculated and zzso according to zzso location and zzso zzso 

The overall PET zzso for zzso was zzso zzso processes accounted for the majority of benign biopsy zzso zzso location significantly affected the zzso zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso and liver zzso zzso had significantly higher zzso for zzso compared with other locations, whereas zzso zzso zzso had a significantly lower zzso for zzso zzso that were zzso suspicious and zzso benign according to CT findings alone were associated with zzso of zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) had a zzso for zzso of zzso 

Over half of zzso zzso zzso zzso and one third of zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso at zzso suggesting that benign zzso appearance alone should not zzso further zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in liver and bone yielded high rates of true zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso yielded a lower rate of zzso compared with other zzso zzso
