In this article a new class of zzso and zzso drugs is zzso These new drugs consist of small zzso and zzso designed to bind to zzso zzso regions that are crucial for the expression of genes such as the zzso zzso in zzso and start sites (and other zzso zzso of viral zzso zzso The components zzso the zzso acids and the sequences they zzso of these peptides could be dictated by the specific binding of zzso acids to their zzso zzso in zzso Cancer cell viability depends on the continued zzso of the zzso zzso and thus this gene is a target of opportunity for zzso zzso zzso reducing the zzso of zzso leads to the death of cancer zzso To achieve this end the following rationale is zzso crucial regions of the zzso promoters (to which zzso proteins must bind for expression to zzso are single stranded and thus strongly resemble the zzso loop of zzso It was found that zzso acids chemically bind to their zzso zzso zzso Regarding the zzso regions of zzso as a series of adjacent zzso zzso and zzso are proposed to be aligned to their zzso zzso in the proper zzso For example, if the zzso region of a promoter is hypothetically zzso the zzso zzso could be expected to bind to it and deny access of the promoter to all zzso zzso thereby blocking zzso expression and all the zzso dependent on such zzso Similarly, it is reported that in the initial phase of gene expression the start sites of the genes are single stranded zzso and after and spanning the start zzso Thus, zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso binding specificity zzso principle as described above, a series of small peptides are suggested that could span the start sites of zzso viral genes zzso the zzso region of zzso zzso virus zzso to deny access of the gene to the zzso zzso This would zzso the toxic effect of the virus and thereby constitute a promising approach to zzso therapy, where the start sites (or other zzso regions of zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso principle (for zzso zzso enables us to focus on probable effective small peptides rather than having to screen a large number of randomly chosen small peptides to find probable zzso and zzso therapeutic zzso
