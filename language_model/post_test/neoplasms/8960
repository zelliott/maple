Bone zzso is a frequent occurrence in late stage solid tumors, including breast zzso prostate or zzso However, the causes for this zzso have only recently been zzso zzso progress has been made in the past decade toward understanding the molecular zzso of bone zzso and much of this research reveals a crucial role of the host zzso in each step of the zzso zzso zzso interactions are crucial in engineering a zzso zzso accommodating zzso seeding, and establishing the vicious cycle of bone zzso Current treatments in bone zzso focus on latter steps of the zzso zzso with most treatments targeting the process of bone zzso however, emerging research identifies many other candidates as promising zzso Host zzso cells including zzso and zzso cells are important in the early steps of zzso zzso attachment and zzso while a variety of immune cells, zzso cells and zzso cells of the bone zzso are important in the establishment of zzso zzso zzso zzso Many participants during these steps have been identified and functionally zzso zzso contributors include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family members, bone resident proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this review, we will discuss the contribution of host zzso cells to zzso niche zzso seeding, zzso zzso immune regulation, and zzso shielding in bone zzso Research exploring these interactions between bone zzso and zzso cells has yielded many therapeutic targets, and we will discuss both the current and future therapeutic avenues in treating bone zzso
