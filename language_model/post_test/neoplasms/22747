The global impairment of mature zzso zzso is emerging as a common feature of human zzso One interesting scenario is that defects in the nuclear export of precursor zzso zzso might occur in transformed zzso zzso 5 zzso mediates zzso nuclear export and zzso we demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso in a subset of human tumors with zzso zzso The zzso genetic zzso traps zzso in the nucleus, reduces zzso processing, and diminishes zzso zzso The zzso zzso form lacks a zzso region that contributes to the formation of the zzso zzso complex and zzso accumulate in the zzso Most importantly, the restoration of zzso functions reverses the impaired export of zzso and has zzso zzso
