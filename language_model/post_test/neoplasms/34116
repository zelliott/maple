The zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are often zzso in high-dose chemotherapy zzso Since these regimens can be complicated by the occurrence of severe and sometimes life-threatening zzso zzso guided administration of these compounds, to reduce zzso in exposure, may lead to improved zzso For rapid dose adaptations during a chemotherapy course, we have developed and validated an zzso using liquid zzso coupled with zzso tandem mass zzso zzso for the routine zzso of zzso zzso and their respective active zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Because of the instability of zzso in zzso the compound is zzso with zzso zzso immediately after sample collection and zzso as zzso Sample zzso consisted of protein zzso with a mixture of methanol and zzso using 100 zzso of zzso zzso separation was performed on an zzso zzso zzso column zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso particle size 5 zzso with a quick zzso using 1 zzso zzso solution and zzso at a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso run time was 10 zzso The triple zzso mass zzso was operating in the positive zzso mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for drug zzso The method was validated over the concentration ranges zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso using 100 zzso of human zzso These dynamic concentration ranges proved to be relevant in daily zzso zzso was used as an internal zzso The zzso of variation were zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso for each zzso Mean zzso were also between the designated limits zzso zzso This robust and rapid zzso zzso is now successfully applied for routine therapeutic drug monitoring of zzso zzso and their zzso in our zzso
