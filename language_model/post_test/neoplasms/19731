zzso is an orally zzso zzso and selective inhibitor of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso forms of zzso zzso The aim of this phase 1, zzso zzso study in four patients with zzso zzso solid tumors was to determine the absolute zzso of a 150 zzso oral dose of zzso A zzso study approach, in which a 50 zzso zzso intravenous zzso zzso of zzso was given zzso with a 150 zzso oral dose, was used to simultaneously recover IV and oral zzso zzso The least squares mean zzso zzso absolute zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso Median zzso after oral administration was zzso hours and the geometric mean terminal zzso was zzso zzso The geometric mean clearance and volume of distribution after IV administration were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Human clearance and volume of distribution at steady state were in agreement with predictions made using zzso zzso of zzso parameters from four zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso absolute zzso was high, whereas zzso metabolism was zzso Furthermore, the zzso approach provided an innovative and efficient method for assessing the absolute zzso of zzso in patients with advanced zzso
