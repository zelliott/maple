The purpose of this study was to investigate the increase in cell kill that can be achieved by tumor zzso with zzso dose zzso targeting hypoxic regions that can be zzso with zzso zzso Starting with a zzso distribution of zzso a microscopic two-dimensional model of tumor zzso was developed using zzso simulation of oxygen zzso zzso imaging of zzso was simulated taking partial volume effect into zzso A zzso scheme was implemented with the goal of delivering higher doses to the hypoxic zzso as seen in simulated zzso zzso To determine the relative cell kill in response to zzso zzso tumor cell survival zzso were compared to those resulting from treatments delivering the same average dose to the zzso in a zzso uniform zzso It was shown that zzso dose zzso may be better suited for tumors with low zzso low hypoxic fraction and zzso zzso hypoxic zzso Most importantly, it was determined that at low fraction doses there is no cell kill increase from targeting hypoxic regions alone versus escalating the total tumor zzso However, for higher doses per fraction zzso zzso the effectiveness of zzso zzso increases, resulting in the zzso effect of up to zzso higher than that of uniform tumor zzso delivering the same average tumor zzso
