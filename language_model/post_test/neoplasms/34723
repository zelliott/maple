Fig fruit latex zzso contains significant amounts of zzso compounds and can serve as a source of antioxidants after human zzso The purpose of this study is to confirm zzso activity of zzso against human cancer cells and to further zzso its mechanism of zzso Human glioblastoma, zzso zzso and normal liver cells were used for in zzso tests of zzso zzso Those tests included zzso colony formation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cells, cell cycle distribution through flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso expression through zzso in response to zzso zzso After zzso treatment, the zzso colony formation, and zzso labeling zzso of cancer cells decreased zzso while the zzso stained zzso cells increased zzso By zzso analysis, an increase of zzso phase cell population and decrease of S and zzso phase cells were observed zzso while both zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso increased zzso The findings in these studies suggested that zzso exhibited potent zzso in some human cancer cells with little effect in normal cells at certain zzso The mechanism for such effects might be associated with the zzso of DNA zzso induction of zzso and cell cycle arrest of cancer zzso
