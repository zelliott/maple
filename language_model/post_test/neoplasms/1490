zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and its zzso vascular zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the major molecules involved in zzso and pathological zzso Here we describe for the first time the development of a specific indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso in different human cell and tissue zzso A combination of the goat zzso zzso zzso and the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso was highly sensitive and zzso with a detection range of zzso zzso The zzso was specific for zzso with no zzso to zzso or zzso Complex formation with zzso and zzso had no effect on the sensitivity of the zzso The zzso concentration in the zzso of cultured human zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso higher than in the zzso from human zzso vein zzso zzso In human zzso breast, zzso gastric and lung cancer zzso the protein levels of zzso were in the range of zzso zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso protein detected in the zzso correlated significantly with the number of zzso positive vessels observed in zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso may be a reliable surrogate of measuring zzso vessel zzso The protein levels of zzso in 27 zzso cell zzso samples had a significant correlation with the levels of zzso zzso or biological active, free zzso zzso but not with zzso or total zzso This zzso provides a useful tool for the investigations of the expression levels of zzso in zzso and pathological zzso particular in cancer and in zzso zzso
