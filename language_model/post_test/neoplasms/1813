A model of tumor growth and tumor response to radiation is introduced in which each tumor cell is taken into account zzso Each cell is assigned a set of zzso zzso and the status of each cell is checked in discrete zzso zzso proliferation is governed by the cell cycle times of tumor cells, the growth zzso the zzso capacity of the zzso and the degree of tumor zzso The response of tumor cells to radiation is determined by the zzso and the zzso zzso Computer simulation is performed on a zzso rigid cubic zzso starting out from a single tumor zzso Random processes are simulated by zzso Carlo zzso Short cell cycle time, high growth zzso and tumor zzso all increase tumor proliferation zzso zzso zzso patterns result in lower total doses needed for tumor control, but the extent of dose reduction depends on the zzso and the zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso alters fully zzso and hypoxic zzso within the tumor and subsequently affects the radiation zzso It is demonstrated for selected zzso parameters that the simulation tools are suitable to zzso assess the total doses needed for tumor zzso Using the simulation tools, it is feasible to simulate zzso effects during zzso zzso and to compare different zzso patterns in terms of their tumor zzso
