zzso zzso evoke cellular zzso programs such as zzso zzso or zzso to protect the zzso from the expansion of damaged and potentially harmful zzso zzso interactions between tumor cells and zzso bystander cells add to zzso modes of tumor suppression during tumor development and zzso In particular, the role of zzso or host immune cells converting zzso signals into a response that feeds back to the tumor cell population has been zzso zzso Using the zzso transgenic mouse zzso model, we zzso how zzso zzso signaling indirectly promotes cellular zzso via zzso that were released by zzso cells in response to zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso primarily promotes zzso in a subset of the tumor cell population, leading to the attraction of zzso which subsequently engulf the zzso zzso zzso zzso in turn, exhibit strongly increased zzso of various zzso among them transforming growth factor beta to an extent that is capable of inducing cellular zzso in surrounding zzso zzso Our findings, zzso in human aggressive zzso zzso unveil that zzso and zzso are not simply two zzso zzso choices of stress responses, but rather cooperate via zzso zzso cells of the innate immune zzso profoundly limit zzso in zzso A deeper zzso understanding of the zzso zzso between different zzso programs will help to identify cellular components of the tumor zzso and their signal zzso that are readily available to impose a second line of host defense against cancer zzso This will open new perspectives for the development of zzso therapies, whose targets not only zzso tumor but also zzso cell zzso
