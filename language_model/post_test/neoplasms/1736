zzso zzso tumors zzso are a distinctive group of zzso zzso of the gastrointestinal zzso The zzso zzso has a central role in the zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression being the gold standard in its zzso The identification of zzso patients has become zzso because the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is effective in the treatment of this zzso However, a small set of zzso remain zzso because zzso protein expression is not always zzso The aim of this study was the identification of new markers for the differential diagnosis of zzso 

By analyzing publicly available data from zzso profiling of zzso we found that protein zzso C zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso is highly and specifically expressed in zzso zzso expression in zzso was confirmed by reverse zzso and Western zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso in a panel of 26 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso and 35 tumors from other zzso 

We found that all of the zzso expressed zzso whereas this protein was zzso in other zzso or zzso tumors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed in zzso cells of zzso 

Our results show that zzso is easily detected by zzso in zzso specimens and that it could be a sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of this zzso
