zzso cells are known to enhance zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso and to inhibit the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso characteristics of cancer cells that allow them to compensate the inefficient extraction of energy from zzso in order to continue their uncontrolled growth and zzso zzso of zzso transport across the plasma membrane is zzso by a family of facilitated zzso zzso proteins named zzso zzso of zzso especially the zzso zzso has been frequently observed in various human zzso Many studies have reported a correlation between zzso expression level and the grade of tumor zzso which suggests that zzso expression may be of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso factor in the transport and zzso metabolism in cancer zzso This paper presents the current state of knowledge on zzso regulation as well as its utility in the diagnosis and therapy of zzso
