Data in the national zzso zzso for England for zzso is based upon downloads of activity from every linear accelerator in the country through its zzso management system linked to the local patient administration system to give a full overview of each patient zzso 

An analysis of this zzso shows that there is still a considerable variation in zzso activity across the country, with a zzso variation between the most and least active zzso Lower activity is seen in London and the southeast compared with the rest of the country, but when the data are split between the north and south of the country, no such variation is zzso zzso is higher in smaller zzso and zzso zzso About half of all treatment is zzso and this proportion does not vary with geography, although there is considerable variation between individual zzso in the proportion of radical zzso zzso There is a trend towards less use of zzso both radical and zzso in the more deprived population groups, although no change in the relative use of zzso and radical zzso 

It is important to zzso that these data currently reflect activity patterns only and do not reflect quality of care or treatment zzso which will be achieved by linkage with cancer registry data in the zzso
