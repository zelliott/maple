The rate of binding of a fluorescent probe for zzso zzso is dependent upon cell temperature as well as zzso zzso cells bind zzso about 5 times less rapidly at 37 degrees C than at 45 degrees zzso Below 42 degrees C, the rate of zzso binding by zzso cells increases by a factor of about two for each 10 degrees C, but above 42 degrees C, the rate increases zzso for each additional 10 degrees zzso However, for cells incubated under zzso these zzso zzso were not observed, and the rate of metabolism and binding increased only zzso per 10 degrees C from 28 degrees to 45 degrees zzso These differences in binding zzso cannot be explained by a decrease in the rate of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso but might involve differences in the available reducing zzso in cells heated under air or zzso The possibility of using fluorescent zzso to measure temperatures of individual tumor cells during zzso treatment is zzso
