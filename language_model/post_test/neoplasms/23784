Several scientists have proposed that DNA repair deficiencies and the induction of a zzso zzso are responsible for the generation of multiple zzso zzso in cancer zzso I propose that exposure to environmental zzso can induce DNA zzso elicit zzso of DNA repair, and cause the instability phenomenon and the subsequent zzso Using cell lines derived from zzso zzso of zzso mice, my laboratory conducted sequential studies to document genetic events leading to the development of zzso cells in zzso We found that zzso and extensive zzso breaks and zzso occurred zzso This is followed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso amplification of the zzso zzso and expression of the zzso zzso Our observation of zzso instability at the early phase of transformation is consistent with the zzso zzso We suggest that a cause of the instability is zzso of DNA repair, and we have developed a challenge zzso to zzso this zzso In this zzso cells are challenged to repair zzso DNA zzso In one of our studies, zzso from cigarette smokers and nonsmokers were exposed to gamma rays in zzso zzso from smokers had significantly more rearranged zzso than cells from nonsmokers after the zzso These data suggest that smokers have zzso of DNA repair and that this repair problem is a cause of health effects in zzso In an in zzso study, zzso were exposed to zzso C or to zzso zzso and then zzso with gamma zzso zzso increased zzso of rearranged zzso were detected with low doses of zzso C and nickel, which do not cause zzso damage by zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
