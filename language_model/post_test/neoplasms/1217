zzso zzso factor zzso and its importance in determining a strategy for cancer chemotherapy are zzso It is suggested that zzso of zzso synthesis or increased zzso zzso might interfere with the metabolism of solid tumor cells more so than in normal cells, and thus hinder zzso and pursuant tumor growth by preventing the synthesis of the zzso component of zzso An attempt is made to indicate potential models for zzso agents of this zzso The drugs offered as initial prototypes for investigations along these lines are zzso D (which likely has zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid (which likely has zzso and zzso zzso and zzso (which in theory might be a purely zzso zzso It is noted that these models may turn out to be less than ideal as therapeutic agents due to problems of zzso zzso zzso or distribution, but nonetheless might serve to yield insights into the design of new cancer zzso zzso In addition, some evidence is cited suggesting that zzso D may be more effective against certain tumors when employed in lower, chronic zzso rather than its present use in zzso zzso concept of zzso agents as fundamentally zzso therapies is discussed, and the likelihood that such agents might be effectively zzso in zzso hosts is zzso The main promise of an zzso strategy is efficacy against presently intractable slowly growing human zzso when used in combination with other treatment zzso In zzso a strategy of cancer chemotherapy predicated upon interference with zzso synthesis or increase in zzso zzso is offered as a potential mechanism for establishing zzso and as a promising alternative and adjunct to present zzso
