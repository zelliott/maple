To explore the association between zzso and mortality from all zzso 

We examined the relationship of zzso and mortality among subjects who participated in the survey of cardiovascular risk factors (in zzso and in zzso Relative zzso zzso were estimated from the zzso zzso hazard model by using a zzso between zzso zzso as reference zzso 

During an average zzso years zzso we documented 307 deaths of which 158 were from cancer, 93 from cardiovascular diseases, and 56 from other zzso We observed a L-shaped relation between zzso and overall zzso zzso for trend zzso zzso In zzso zzso we found that the zzso of mortality for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with the risk among subjects with zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of overall mortality among subjects with zzso of zzso zzso zzso was still significant after the exclusion of subjects who died from zzso during the first five years zzso 

Total mortality was increased among zzso people, and this association can not been completely explained by smoking and early deaths from zzso
