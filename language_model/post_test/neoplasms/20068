zzso is a potent zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with activity in zzso zzso Given zzso data showing greater induction of gene expression with longer zzso to zzso a phase I study of a day 1, 3, and 5 zzso schedule was zzso A secondary objective was to assess the effect of zzso on radioactive zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso phase I, 3 + 3 dose escalation zzso zzso was administered as a zzso infusion on days 1, 3, and 5 of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso including zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer, and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients with solid tumors, including 11 patients with zzso cancer were zzso Six dose levels were zzso and 7 zzso on days 1, 3, and 5 was identified as zzso No Response zzso zzso In Solid zzso objective responses were recorded although 9 patients had stable disease a median 30 weeks zzso zzso including 6 with zzso cancer a median of 33 zzso zzso studies detected zzso zzso in zzso and zzso changes beginning at low dose zzso zzso zzso scans in patients with zzso zzso zzso cancer did not detect meaningful zzso 

A zzso dose of 7 zzso administered on days 1, 3, and 5 was found tolerable and resulted in zzso zzso in zzso Although there were no objective responses with zzso alone, this schedule may be useful for developing combination studies in solid zzso
