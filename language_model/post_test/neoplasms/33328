zzso zzso is a fundamental feature in normal human zzso cells and results from dysfunctional zzso at the zzso cell division zzso zzso radiation zzso prematurely zzso the same zzso as zzso zzso prior to the zzso zzso This process is known as zzso premature zzso zzso Since the cell cycle is zzso arrested in zzso cells, even if they are zzso by various growth factors, it is thought that zzso is a form of cell death, zzso eliminating replicating zzso zzso formation of DNA repair zzso a marker of DNA damage, is detected in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, both processes persistently induce cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms, indicating DNA damage created by zzso radiation zzso zzso in normal cells, possibly by the same mechanisms as those occurring in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso not only in normal cells, but also in tumor zzso Due to the expression of zzso in tumor cells, zzso zzso zzso does not zzso However, zzso is induced under certain conditions after zzso zzso Thus, cell death triggered by zzso can be attributed to zzso or zzso in tumor zzso However, zzso function remains intact in zzso cancer cells, and recent studies show that zzso eliminate cells undergoing zzso zzso various kinds of factors outside the cell, changing the zzso Evidence using zzso systems containing normal zzso zzso cells and zzso tumor cells show that factors zzso from zzso zzso cells promote the growth of tumor zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso Thus, regulation of factors zzso from zzso zzso cells, as well as tumor cells, may affect zzso
