zzso agents targeted against zzso and tumor cell invasive potential form a new class of zzso zzso zzso administered zzso zzso zzso is both zzso and zzso An zzso zzso powder zzso has been developed to zzso zzso zzso A phase I dose escalation trial with zzso analysis has been zzso 

zzso patients with zzso solid tumors and good end organ function and performance status were enrolled onto the zzso Patients received a test dose followed 1 week later by daily administration of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso at doses of 100 to 350 zzso Patients remained on zzso until disease progression or zzso zzso Plasma samples were taken to characterize the zzso parameters of this zzso of zzso 

All patients were zzso for toxicity and 18 were zzso for zzso and response zzso Grade 1 and 2 gastrointestinal side effects were observed in up to 50% of zzso zzso toxicity was observed in both patients treated at 350 zzso consisting of zzso grade 2 to 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and confusion zzso zzso zzso One minor response zzso was observed in a patient with zzso cell zzso and another nine patients had disease stabilization zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated reduced zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso liquid zzso previously zzso 

The better toxicity profile of zzso zzso zzso with similar frequency of disease stabilization and ease of administration compared with the liquid or gelatin zzso suggests that the zzso zzso is a preferable zzso for subsequent zzso A dose of 300 zzso is proposed for phase II zzso
