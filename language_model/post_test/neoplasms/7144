Cell migration and zzso are zzso dependent functions that play a key role in zzso zzso Specialized zzso cells in water transport have specific zzso zzso that make these cells adopt a zzso shape, forming a sealed zzso which functions as zzso zzso Also, specific polarized zzso zzso are formed at the front and the rear of migratory zzso zzso In pathological processes such as cancer, increased migration occurs in invasive cells driven by the formation of polarized and differential zzso zzso zzso the main product zzso by the zzso zzso during dark phase of the zzso acts as a zzso zzso in normal and cancer zzso In this paper we will zzso evidence supporting that zzso acts as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, and we will describe its effects on zzso organization involved in the mechanism by which zzso zzso water zzso In addition, we will review recent data that indicate that zzso is able to switch zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cancer cells, from invasive migratory cells to dormant zzso zzso that occur in zzso migratory zzso Moreover, we will discuss the implications of the zzso as therapeutic target for cancer zzso
