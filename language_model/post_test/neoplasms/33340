zzso killer zzso cells are a zzso population of immune cells derived from peripheral blood zzso with a high zzso potential ex zzso This study shows a rapid and zzso protocol for adoptive zzso with zzso cells in patients with zzso zzso For this purpose a new automatic cell processing device zzso Baxter zzso was tested to improve extensive zzso of these zzso 

Twenty zzso expansions obtained from healthy donors and patients with zzso zzso were washed and zzso with fresh medium during culture with the zzso Recovery, zzso and zzso activity were zzso Six zzso zzso procedures were thawed and processed for washing out zzso zzso zzso Recovery of cells, zzso and early zzso were measured immediately after zzso and zzso activity against target cell lines zzso and zzso was tested after short zzso 

zzso volume of zzso cultures was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After automatic zzso the total zzso cell recovery was zzso percent zzso zzso and living cells were greater than 95 zzso After zzso the median zzso of total zzso cells and natural killer T zzso cells were, respectively, zzso percent zzso zzso and zzso percent zzso zzso zzso cells preserved their zzso activity after zzso zzso 50% zzso at zzso ratio of zzso 

The automatic wash with the zzso showed a good recovery of viable zzso cells during expansion and allowed an efficient manipulation of thawed zzso The use of this simple and efficient washing technique is suitable for zzso processing in cellular therapy zzso
