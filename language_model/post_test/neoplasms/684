zzso studies have shown that the combination of zzso and zzso is zzso To evaluate the schedule dependency of this interaction, the following phase I trial was designed to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in patients with zzso solid zzso 

In part 1, patients received zzso on day 1 and zzso on days 1, 2, and 3 zzso zzso In part 2, zzso was administered on days 1, 2, and 3, followed by zzso on day 3 zzso zzso zzso were determined in plasma and DNA zzso I zzso activity and zzso zzso in zzso and tumor zzso 

zzso patients were zzso zzso zzso during the zzso schedule were grade 4 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso target area under the free zzso plasma concentration versus time curve, 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the zzso schedule included grade 4 zzso zzso zzso fever, and grade 4 zzso and vomiting zzso zzso target area under the free zzso plasma concentration versus time curve, 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One complete response and five partial responses were zzso The clearance of and exposure to zzso and zzso did not depend on the sequence of drug zzso No zzso effects were seen in zzso levels and DNA zzso I zzso activity in zzso and tumor zzso However, zzso was clearly more evident in the zzso zzso 

The zzso schedule was better tolerated because both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Other zzso factors than the ones investigated must explain the zzso differences in zzso
