With the use of an in zzso model system, the mode of action of zzso on zzso natural killer zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells was zzso Of the steroids tested, only the zzso notably suppressed zzso zzso zzso were not toxic to the zzso zzso cell since zzso of protein synthesis protected zzso activity from the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, although suppressed in zzso activity, were unable to suppress the zzso activity of normal zzso zzso cell zzso Similarly, the zzso of zzso cultures were also unable to suppress normal zzso zzso Thus a role for zzso cell activity or soluble zzso factors was zzso zzso of analyses of the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells at the zzso level demonstrated that zzso zzso cells could efficiently bind to zzso zzso cells but were incapable of inducing zzso Moreover, the production of zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso nude mouse zzso cell cultures was severely depressed after zzso zzso The results of these studies suggest that zzso suppress zzso zzso activity by acting directly on the zzso zzso cells, possibly by zzso the formation or release of specific zzso molecules that are zzso to zzso tumor zzso
