The zzso level of zzso P in plasma from subjects with cancer at different sites was compared with that from control subjects in a zzso zzso zzso A health screening of 12,500 middle-aged men was performed during zzso in zzso Sweden, and from the 400 cancer cases that were identified during follow-up until the end of 1988, zzso plasma samples were available for analysis of zzso zzso Two living controls per case of the same screening day and age were zzso zzso P levels in zzso of major cancer sites were lower in cases than in controls for the respiratory tract zzso and zzso arbitrary units, zzso p zzso zzso cancer zzso The odds ratio for overall cancer risk in the lowest zzso of zzso P level compared with that in the highest was zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso In zzso of major cancer sites, the odds ratios for cancer risk in the lowest zzso compared with the highest were zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso in the respiratory tract and zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In cases + controls, zzso P was lower in smokers than in nonsmokers zzso zzso zzso zzso P was significantly correlated to plasma zzso zzso blood zzso and body mass index and zzso correlated to plasma alpha zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that a low plasma zzso P level is associated with higher future risk of respiratory and zzso tract cancer in middle-aged zzso
