An updated zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice was recently published using zzso statistical methods zzso et zzso zzso In this work, this model was applied to humans, as recommended by Sweeney et zzso zzso parameters for input into the zzso analysis were selected from multiple sources zzso in each case, the source that was considered to represent the most current scientific evidence for each zzso zzso data for individual subjects from five human studies were combined into a single data set and population values derived using zzso These population values were used for zzso of the human zzso The zzso model using the zzso zzso parameters was used to perform a cancer risk assessment for zzso using the same tumor zzso and exposure concentration data relied upon in the current zzso zzso Unit risks, zzso the risk of cancer from exposure to 1 zzso over a zzso for zzso were estimated using the zzso human zzso The results indicate skewed zzso for liver and lung tumor risks, alone or in zzso with a mean unit risk zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso considering both liver and lung zzso Adding the distribution of genetic zzso for metabolism to the ultimate zzso the unit risks range from 0 (which is expected given that approximately zzso of the US population is estimated to be zzso up to a unit risk of zzso zzso zzso at the 95th zzso The zzso or 50th zzso is zzso zzso zzso which is approximately a factor of 500 lower than the current zzso unit risk of zzso zzso zzso using a previous zzso zzso These values represent the best estimates to date for zzso cancer risk because all available human data sets were used, and a zzso methodology was zzso
