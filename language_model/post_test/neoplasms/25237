Despite highly developed specific immune responses, zzso cells often manage to escape recognition by the immune system, continuing to grow zzso Experimental work suggests that mature zzso cells may be central to the zzso of the specific immune zzso zzso and subsequent control of zzso growth by the cells of the specific immune response depend on the balance between immature zzso and mature zzso zzso cells in the zzso However, zzso cells produce zzso that inhibit zzso zzso altering the balance between zzso and zzso zzso the focus of this manuscript is on the study of the potential role of this zzso mechanism on zzso growth zzso A conceptual zzso type model that incorporates the dynamics and interactions of zzso cells, zzso T cells, zzso and zzso is proposed in order to address the role of this zzso The prey zzso has a zzso mechanism zzso the maturation of zzso that prevents the zzso zzso zzso from recognizing zzso The model, a zzso zzso system of ordinary differential zzso is reduced to a two-dimensional system using zzso arguments that are tied to the maturation rate of zzso Analysis shows that the model is capable of supporting biologically reasonable patterns of zzso depending on the initial zzso A range of zzso where healing without external influences can occur, is identified both zzso and zzso
