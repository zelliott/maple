zzso zzso by electron capture and/or internal conversion is accompanied by complex atomic vacancy zzso and zzso of low-energy zzso resulting in a highly charged daughter atom and a high density of electron zzso in the immediate vicinity of the zzso zzso The molecular and cellular consequences of such zzso events include DNA strand breaks, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso division zzso and cell zzso zzso to cells depends largely on the zzso location of the zzso zzso outside the cell nucleus produce zzso radiation effects zzso approximately zzso In contrast, zzso in DNA cause pronounced zzso effects zzso approximately zzso However, recent studies suggest that even for zzso zzso zzso cell damage can be modified to resemble the pattern observed with zzso zzso These findings indicate that the molecular and cellular zzso responsible for the zzso effects of zzso zzso remain zzso
