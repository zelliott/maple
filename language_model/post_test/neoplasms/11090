zzso evidence has demonstrated that zzso T cells play an important role in zzso immune zzso Thus, adoptive transfer of these cells may have great potential for zzso zzso However, due to the difficulty to generate sufficient zzso zzso T cells, the use of zzso T cells in tumor therapy is zzso It has been found that zzso zzso enhances the proliferation and zzso activity of zzso zzso T cells, but the effect of zzso zzso on zzso T cells remains zzso Here, the effects of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice were evaluated and it was discovered that zzso zzso zzso T cells expressed both soluble and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression led to a selective expansion of zzso zzso T cells by zzso their zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells were more effective in suppressing tumor growth than control zzso zzso zzso zzso To ensure the safety of the method, the employment of zzso zzso gene made it possible to eliminate these transgenic zzso T cells following zzso zzso Together, we show that zzso zzso induced a selective expansion of zzso zzso T cells ex zzso and enhanced their zzso effects in zzso This has an important significance for improving the efficacy of adoptive T cell zzso
