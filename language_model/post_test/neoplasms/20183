We have extended our studies on the relationship between zzso DNA damage in readily accessible zzso and clinical response to zzso Such an approach may assist in the study of cancer drug resistance and in establishing parameters for assessing human populations for sensitivity to DNA damaging agents in the zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by atomic zzso zzso DNA repair capacity was assessed in human zzso by the ability to repair zzso zzso in cellular DNA or in zzso zzso zzso In a zzso study of 21 patients receiving combination zzso drug therapy, there was a direct relationship between DNA damage in zzso and disease response zzso zzso p zzso zzso The cohort of patients had 15 different tumor types, suggesting that blood tissue and tumor tissue of an individual may process zzso damage similarly regardless of the tissue of origin of the zzso In zzso in zzso persistence and zzso were prominent features of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA repair capacity has been studied in eight human zzso cell lines in zzso zzso zzso three, zzso one, zzso one, zzso using a host cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso In the three T cell lines zzso host cell zzso efficiency was directly related to the zzso abilities to repair zzso cellular DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
