zzso of zzso to zzso presenting cells zzso is a key issue for developing effective cancer zzso Controlling the tissue distribution of zzso can increase zzso immune responses, including the induction of zzso T zzso zzso Heat shock protein 70 zzso forms complexes with a variety of zzso zzso via its zzso zzso Because zzso is taken up by zzso through recognition by zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso its application to zzso delivery systems has been examined both in experimental and clinical zzso A tissue distribution study revealed that zzso is mainly taken up by the liver, especially by zzso after intravenous injection in zzso A significant amount of zzso was also delivered to regional zzso zzso when it was injected zzso supporting the hypothesis that zzso is a natural targeting system for zzso Model zzso were zzso with or zzso to zzso resulting in greater zzso immune zzso zzso delivery of zzso further increased the efficacy of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that effective cancer therapy can be achieved by developing zzso zzso vaccines when their tissue and zzso distribution is properly zzso
