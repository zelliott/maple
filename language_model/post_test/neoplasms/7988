One of the most exciting findings in recent years has been the discovery of zzso interference zzso zzso zzso hold the promise to selectively inhibit gene expression in zzso zzso is an innate cellular process activated when a zzso zzso zzso zzso of greater than 19 duplex zzso enters the cell, causing the degradation of not only the invading zzso zzso but also zzso zzso zzso of identical zzso including zzso zzso The use of zzso for zzso therapies has been widely zzso especially in viral infections, zzso and inherited genetic zzso As such, zzso technology is a potentially useful method to develop highly specific zzso zzso zzso
