zzso targeted treatment of zzso requires a careful control of drug zzso We review recent advances in this area focusing on a particular marker for zzso zzso the poorly wrapped hydrogen bond or zzso a packing zzso in the protein zzso zzso promote their own zzso and are generally not zzso across zzso Thus, the so-called zzso zzso is geared at enhancing drug specificity by developing zzso that can contribute zzso to shield zzso from water zzso This type of design is guided by an analysis of protein zzso and the assessment of environmental changes around zzso hydrogen bonds occurring upon zzso zzso differences across zzso targets have been exploited to redesign drugs in order to enhance zzso Tested wrapping modifications to established cancer drugs are zzso The rationally directed impact of the zzso compounds points to a broad zzso of the wrapping technology, ultimately leading to molecular therapies with tighter control of side zzso New perspectives on the treatment of cancer progression using the wrapping technology are zzso In particular, we discuss a future strategy to develop highly selective zzso targeting a signaling complex critical to cancer zzso
