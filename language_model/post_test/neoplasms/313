Three zzso zzso systems were compared on the basis of their abilities to heat zzso zzso seeds, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The theoretical calculations were performed using two-dimensional tumor models containing zzso tissue and electrical properties and various blood flow zzso Basic assumptions were kept the same to permit a meaningful comparison of the different zzso Power deposition patterns were calculated based on the appropriate theoretical zzso The zzso transfer equation was solved using a finite element zzso zzso zzso were calculated for four 1 or 2 zzso diameter implants on the corners of 1, 2, and 3 zzso zzso The tumor was assumed to be circular with a diameter 1 zzso longer than the diagonal of each zzso Three blood flow models were zzso zzso zzso and concentric zzso zzso zzso The blood flow ranged from 0 to 100 zzso zzso with the ratio of zzso tissue blood flow ranging from 0 to zzso A zzso Equipment Performance zzso rating was used as a criterion for comparing the temperature zzso from the various cases zzso As expected, the higher zzso ratings were generally produced by decreasing the spacing between the implants and/or lower blood zzso zzso Under the conditions of this study, the zzso antennas were able to adequately heat a larger number of cases to therapeutic temperatures than either of the other two zzso
