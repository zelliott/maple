zzso refers broadly to a field of applied science and technology whose unifying theme is the control of matter on the molecular level in scales smaller than 1 zzso normally 1 to 100 zzso and the fabrication of devices within that size zzso In the last five years this technology has been improved tremendously in disease diagnosis and prognosis and maximum research and clinical work has been completed in zzso The use of various pharmaceutical zzso has become one of the most important areas of zzso Novel zzso can complement and augment existing zzso and zzso techniques to analyze variations across different tumor types, thus offering the potential to distinguish between normal and zzso zzso Sensitive zzso constructed of zzso components zzso zzso zzso and zzso can recognize genetic and molecular events and have reporting capabilities, thereby offering the potential to detect rare molecular signals associated with zzso Such signals may then be collected for analysis by zzso harvesters that selectively isolate zzso molecules from zzso The implication of zzso in cancer is discussed in this article with an emphasis on zzso zzso imaging studies for diagnosis, and its role in therapeutic zzso
