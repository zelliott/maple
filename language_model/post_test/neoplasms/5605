zzso zzso has been in use for more than 30 years as a pharmaceutical drug in humans for the treatment of zzso Animal studies give clear evidence that it causes a variety of acute and chronic toxic effects, including liver and zzso cancer in zzso abnormal germ cell zzso zzso and zzso in various zzso No sufficient data from human studies are available at present to exclude a risk in zzso therefore, attempts were made to zzso the mechanisms responsible for the toxic effects of zzso and to address the question whether such effects might occur in humans undergoing zzso zzso It is well documented that zzso acts as a zzso poison and its zzso toxicity as well as the induction of zzso zzso aberrations and of zzso in zzso cells possibly may result from zzso of zzso zzso Likewise, a zzso relationship between zzso and cancer has been repeatedly zzso However, a critical survey of the data available on zzso chemicals revealed insufficient evidence for such an zzso zzso other mechanisms may be responsible for the zzso effects of the zzso The induction of zzso tumors in rats by zzso is apparently a consequence of the decrease of zzso levels and it is unlikely that such effects occur in zzso zzso The appearance of zzso zzso zzso in mice on zzso diet is preceded by various zzso and zzso changes in the zzso Among these, zzso zzso is zzso it may result from zzso of zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mouse liver is followed by cell damage and zzso and inflammatory zzso Similar changes are known from certain human zzso which are also associated with an increased risk for zzso However, the zzso effect of zzso therapy in humans is moderate compared with that in the mouse model, although more detailed studies should be performed in order to clarify this relationship on a quantitative zzso A further important effect of zzso in mice is the formation of Mallory bodies zzso in zzso These zzso abnormalities occur also in humans, although under different zzso their appearance is associated with the induction of liver disease and zzso zzso liver damage associated with zzso and zzso formation, enhanced cell zzso liver enlargement, and zzso induction all may contribute to the zzso effect of zzso in zzso In conclusion, further investigation is required for adequate assessment of health risks to humans under zzso zzso
