A large number of human zzso zzso peptides have been identified that are recognized by zzso in a zzso restricted zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso in many human zzso as part of their zzso zzso Since zzso or loss of zzso expression might impair tumor growth and survival, this protein may serve as a rational target for zzso zzso zzso By Western zzso technique, we screened a panel of established human tumor cell lines for proteins involved in the zzso zzso Two of eight tumor cell lines, a B zzso zzso and a colon zzso zzso cell line showed increased zzso protein expression whereas the majority of tumor cell lines expressed zzso zzso Neither zzso nor peripheral blood zzso cells showed zzso zzso An zzso restricted zzso zzso was deduced in zzso from the zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein and its binding affinity for zzso was confirmed using a zzso binding zzso We here demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These zzso specific zzso react with and lyse zzso human colon zzso zzso cells which have been zzso with a zzso zzso DNA construct similar to that expressed in the transgenic zzso Based on these zzso we suggest that zzso may be a target for immune zzso
