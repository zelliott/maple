Despite the overall genetic similarity that exists between humans and zzso the species are zzso zzso Among the most notable distinctions are differences in brain size and cognitive zzso Previous studies have shown that significant differences in gene expression exist between the human and zzso zzso zzso of currently available gene expression data with known zzso and signaling pathways indicates that the expression of genes involved in the programmed cell death of brain zzso is significantly different between humans and chimpanzees and zzso of a reduced level of zzso zzso in the human zzso This pattern of expression is generally maintained in other human zzso suggesting that zzso is reduced in humans relative to zzso We propose that a decreased rate of programmed zzso death may have been a consequence of selection for increased cognitive ability in zzso Since reduced zzso function is associated with an increased risk of cancer and related diseases, we zzso that selection for increased cognitive ability in humans zzso resulted in an increased risk of cancer and other diseases associated with reduced zzso zzso
