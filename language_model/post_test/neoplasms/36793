We applied the techniques of spatial zzso zzso analysis to 40 cancer mortality zzso in Western zzso One of the aims of these methods is to describe the scale over which spatial patterns of zzso occur, which may provide suggestions concerning the agents bringing about the zzso We analyzed zzso registration areas, applying one- and two-dimensional zzso as well as local zzso zzso We find that cancer zzso are unusually strongly zzso zzso zzso similar spatial structuring of the responsible zzso The small number of spatial patterns (4 or 5) in the 40 cancer zzso suggests there are fewer zzso patterned agents than the number of zzso zzso zzso present in variables will bias the results of conventional statistical tests applied to zzso After correcting for such bias, some zzso correlations of cancer mortality zzso remain zzso suggesting zzso zzso meaningful zzso Local zzso is a useful technique for exploring zzso zzso It found homogeneous high overall cancer zzso in Denmark and homogeneous low zzso in southern Italy, as well as a very zzso pattern for zzso cancer in zzso
