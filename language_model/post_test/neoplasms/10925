Our previous study revealed that zzso a zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of human zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice and suppressed zzso N zzso activity more zzso than zzso In this study, we examined the zzso effect of zzso on migration and formation of zzso tube of human zzso vascular zzso cells zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso did not possess zzso to zzso proliferation according to the zzso zzso and zzso blue exclusion zzso However, zzso activity on cell surface of zzso was suppressed in the presence of zzso as measured by zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso of scratch and zzso chamber showed that zzso significantly inhibited zzso migration and invasion through zzso coated zzso zzso zzso tube formation zzso revealed that the number of branch points formed by zzso on 3-D zzso was reduced after incubation with zzso The zzso of zzso was verified in zzso zzso in zzso The mean vascular density zzso and mean vascular zzso diameter zzso were markedly reduced by zzso after two weeks of intravenous injection as evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression of cancer zzso was greater than that of zzso The zzso of zzso molecules may involve in zzso of zzso The levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso were decreased in zzso and zzso zzso after treatment with zzso as determined by Western zzso zzso These results indicated that the high efficacy of zzso may partially relate to the zzso of zzso
