To study the epidemiology and outcomes of zzso in patients with zzso or solid organ zzso cared for at the University Hospital of zzso zzso 

This prospective study was conducted during a zzso period zzso Patients with bacterial and zzso blood stream infections were followed until zzso zzso was the primary outcome, while duration of zzso zzso time to zzso and zzso were the secondary zzso 

Ninety-nine patients with zzso (104 zzso were zzso zzso developed mainly in patients with zzso zzso zzso Secondary zzso due to respiratory and urinary tract infections were most commonly zzso zzso bacteria were the predominantly isolated pathogens zzso zzso zzso was the most common cause zzso followed closely by zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mortality was zzso No differences in mortality were seen among patients in different zzso according to isolated bacteria zzso to zzso zzso species, or number of isolated bacteria in positive zzso zzso or solid organ zzso zzso and primary or secondary zzso However, patients with zzso due to extensively drug resistant bacteria had higher mortality than patients with zzso due to zzso resistant or susceptible zzso Patients required a prolonged period of hospitalization zzso zzso zzso zzso which was complicated with relapses or zzso in another body site in 27 % of zzso 

zzso bacteria were the predominantly isolated pathogens from patients with cancer in our zzso The overall mortality remains zzso
