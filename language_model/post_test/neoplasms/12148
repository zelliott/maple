To establish a zzso liquid zzso zzso method for determination of the concentration of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso in human zzso 

Plasma zzso zzso spiked with zzso as an internal standard was extracted with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was evaporated at 60 zzso and the zzso was zzso with zzso zzso of the solution used as the mobile zzso After zzso 50 zzso of the zzso was injected into the zzso zzso zzso was achieved on a zzso zzso zzso multiply 50 zzso 5 zzso column at 25 zzso with the flow rate of the mobile phase set to zzso zzso The compounds were detected at 268 zzso The mobile phase consisted of zzso zzso zzso ammonium buffer solution zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The linear range was zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso The limit of detection zzso was zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso while the limit of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The average recovery of zzso and zzso by this method were zzso % and zzso zzso zzso For zzso and zzso the corresponding standard zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso were both less than zzso zzso 

An zzso method was established to measure the zzso of zzso and zzso in human plasma and was effectively applied to the zzso and zzso zzso studies of 8 Chinese patients with zzso zzso
