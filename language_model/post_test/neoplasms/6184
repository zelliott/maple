zzso protein 1 zzso proteins are zzso of zzso gene zzso that is zzso by zzso 9 of zzso zzso zzso zzso Current knowledge supports a paradigm zzso zzso proteins achieve repression by binding to zzso marks and interacting to zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso which zzso this zzso on adjacent zzso thereby zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso However, the mechanism underlying the recruitment of this zzso regulator to target gene promoters remains poorly zzso In the current study, we reveal for the first time a mechanism zzso zzso is recruited to promoters by a well characterized zzso zzso factor zzso in a zzso manner, to mediate complex biological zzso A zzso zzso domain identified at position zzso of zzso mediates the binding of zzso and zzso in zzso and in cultured zzso zzso also recruits zzso and its zzso zzso zzso to promoters to limit zzso gene zzso Indeed, a zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso by zzso zzso zzso decreasing zzso while increasing zzso zzso zzso impairment of zzso zzso recruitment zzso tumor suppression, providing direct evidence that zzso act in a zzso manner to achieve this function rather than its well characterized binding to zzso zzso without zzso zzso these studies reveal a novel role for zzso as a zzso in tumor suppression, expand our zzso understanding of a zzso associated to human disease, and outline cellular and zzso mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, increasing the specificity of targeting zzso complexes to gene zzso
