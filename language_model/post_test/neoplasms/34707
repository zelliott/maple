Currently, zzso appears to be a process much more complex than what was believed a decade zzso The study of the zzso of human zzso cells has revealed a number of genetic and zzso modifications much greater than zzso Moreover, the delay between the first initiating event (when its timing is precisely known) and the clinical emergence of a cancer can be very long, up to 60 zzso This long delay shows that risk factors during infancy and childhood deserve critical zzso The zzso data emphasize the role of zzso For example, alcohol, zzso are not zzso but cause irritation and cell zzso Even for zzso the role of promotion appears to be more important than that of zzso In human zzso initial zzso do not appear to be a limiting or crucial zzso Finally, the biological study of zzso has shown that the initiating cell is not passively affected by the zzso of damages by the zzso physical or chemical zzso It zzso through at least three zzso zzso by fighting against zzso oxygen species zzso generated by any zzso stress, such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso by eliminating injured cells zzso or zzso through two zzso zzso which can be initiated by doses as low as a few zzso thus eliminating cells with zzso that have been damaged or zzso zzso death of cells during zzso when zzso have not been zzso zzso by stimulating or zzso DNA repair zzso Furthermore, zzso communication systems inform a cell about the presence of an insult in zzso zzso A system of zzso induction of zzso exists zzso zzso cells can selectively remove transformed zzso Modern zzso analysis of cellular genes using zzso technology reveals that many genes are activated by doses of zzso agents much lower than those for which zzso is zzso These methods have been a source of considerable zzso Moreover, it was thought that zzso was initiated by zzso of the zzso affecting at random a few specific targets zzso zzso zzso zzso This relatively simple model has been replaced by a more complex one, in which the relationship between the initiated cells and their zzso plays an essential zzso Thus, the zzso process is zzso by effective zzso mechanisms in the cell, tissue and the zzso With regard to zzso the mechanisms that govern zzso and direct tissue repair after injury appear to play also an important role in the control of cell zzso This is particularly important when a transformed cell is surrounded by normal cells that appear to be able to inhibit its zzso zzso disorganization by inflammation or by the death of a large proportion of cells is often associated with the escape of the initiated cells and the emergence of a clone of zzso zzso The effectiveness of zzso is also shown by the large increase in the zzso of several types of zzso among zzso zzso
