zzso peripheral zzso zzso is a common side effect of cancer treatment in children; however, measurement of zzso has been hampered by limitations in available tools, which may impact prevalence zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the relative ability of the Common zzso zzso zzso rating process to detect sensory and motor zzso as compared to administration of the pediatric modified Total zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso was administered to 60 zzso ages zzso undergoing treatment for acute zzso zzso lymphoma, or zzso solid zzso zzso zzso scores for the same time point were zzso from the medical record by a separate trained zzso Comparisons were made between scores using descriptive statistics, zzso and specificity and sensitivity zzso 

The median zzso score was 9 (32 zzso while the median sensory and motor zzso ratings were 0 and 2, respectively (4 and 5 possible, zzso There was no correlation between zzso and combined sensory and motor zzso zzso The only zzso item with significant correlation to zzso scoring was strength zzso Medical record abstraction of zzso scores failed to identify sensory zzso in zzso and significant motor zzso zzso muscle test grade 3 or worse) in zzso of zzso 

Prospective measures of zzso using the zzso identified a far greater proportion of subjects with peripheral zzso as compared to zzso zzso sensory and motor zzso ratings, and thus we recommend the use of a specific measure of zzso such as the zzso
