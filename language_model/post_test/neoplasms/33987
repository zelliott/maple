Recent large-scale zzso projects afford a unique opportunity to identify many novel disease genes and thereby better understand the genetic basis of human zzso zzso zzso of Mouse zzso 2, the largest mouse zzso project yet, provides a wealth of data on novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and provides a unique opportunity to identify novel human disease zzso 

To demonstrate the power of combining the zzso 2 zzso zzso with a zzso candidate approach and zzso analysis to identify genes underlying human genetic zzso 

By mapping all zzso 2 zzso to the human zzso we were able to identify mouse clones that zzso on the human zzso with mapped but zzso human disease zzso By this method we identified mouse and corresponding human genes mapping within the zzso of 100 different human genetic diseases zzso zzso of zzso zzso Of particular interest was the zzso through zzso 2 novel mouse gene data of candidate human genes for the zzso zzso zzso zzso neural tube zzso zzso syndrome, zzso syndrome and zzso zzso zzso zzso cum zzso zzso neurological zzso benign familial infantile convulsions 3, zzso zzso zzso with retained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cancer and zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso 

The zzso 2 data will dramatically accelerate efforts to identify genes underlying human zzso It will also facilitate the creation of transgenic mouse models to help zzso the function of potential human disease zzso
