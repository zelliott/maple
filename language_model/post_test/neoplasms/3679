The potential of zzso laser zzso zzso zzso and near infrared zzso zzso to detect acute effects of different zzso agents on zzso and blood volume in tumors was zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso in the rear foot of zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso acid zzso 150 zzso zzso acid zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 250 zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso or zzso zzso 500 zzso zzso zzso before and after treatment was evaluated by zzso zzso using a 41 degrees C heated zzso zzso probe with four integrated zzso units, and tumor blood volume was estimated by zzso using light guide coupled zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly decreased tumor zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduced the blood volume within the zzso indicating that these compounds to some degree zzso blood from the tumor to adjacent zzso zzso being most zzso zzso caused no change in the tumor blood volume, indicating that the mechanism of action of zzso was vascular shut down with the blood pool trapped in the zzso zzso caused no change in either tumor zzso or tumor blood zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso can determine acute effects of vascular zzso agents on tumor zzso and blood zzso
