The results of block model calculations for multiple zzso of a zzso sphere and circular cylinder suggest that it is essential that the cells must be arranged for a zzso of the body being zzso the zzso elements must be reasonably accurate, and the cells must be small enough so that the zzso basis approximation is not blatantly zzso When these criteria are approximately satisfied the remaining errors appear to be mainly due to imperfect representation of the shape of the object being zzso It appears that the accuracy can be improved by using zzso having cells of reduced size near the surface of the zzso Geometric factors are defined which allow testing the potential accuracy of a solution without zzso or zzso a large zzso Several unique procedures for zzso are also described that have the potential of partially zzso the errors due to inaccurate representation of the shape of a zzso
