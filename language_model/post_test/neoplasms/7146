zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a hallmark of zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso are currently used for therapy of zzso or zzso zzso however, their mode of action is not completely zzso To investigate the zzso effects of zzso zzso we generated a three-dimensional zzso model of zzso zzso and used this model to study the effect of zzso zzso on zzso migration toward zzso zzso with the blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso fragments or an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor led to substantially increased zzso zzso into zzso zzso tumor zzso but not into those with low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso suggesting that the observed increase in zzso zzso depends on interference with zzso zzso Using a human zzso zzso we demonstrated that the blockade of zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells leads to differential expression of several zzso and zzso including the zzso zzso The significant zzso of zzso on exposure to zzso zzso was confirmed by quantitative zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, blocking zzso zzso inhibited zzso migration toward tumor cells induced by zzso zzso pointing to an important role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to tumor zzso by zzso zzso zzso This novel mechanism for zzso zzso action may contribute to the zzso effects of zzso zzso in zzso
