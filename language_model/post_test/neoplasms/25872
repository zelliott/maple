Our aim in this project was to zzso a zzso beam phase space for use in dose zzso The phase space was modeled by incorporating the following zzso derived zzso beam production zzso the intensity variation due to the heel effect, the energy variation due to the differing amount of target material traversed by the zzso and the finite source zzso The initial energy spectrum used was generated using a computer zzso A zzso Carlo code was adapted in order to examine the zzso of the calculated phase zzso zzso zzso calculated using the modeled phase space for zzso and zzso zzso fields show agreement with experimental values to within zzso and zzso respectively, for the central zzso of the field zzso Within the field but outside this range a maximum of zzso difference (for the zzso zzso zzso was observed, however, these values were in a region of sharp zzso and hence small geometric zzso The zzso of the profiles were zzso by up to zzso Due to uncertainties in experiment zzso and zzso Carlo zzso the modeled phase space is deemed acceptable for phantom and zzso zzso calculations within the field zzso
