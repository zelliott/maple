We now know that zzso instability contributes to zzso The zzso mosaic eye zzso developed by George zzso takes advantage of the zzso transparency to provide an excellent zzso for detecting zzso zzso This zzso allowed us to identify zzso zzso with increased zzso of zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso Here, we have described details of zzso the basis and practical use of the mosaic eye zzso and the zzso methods used to study zzso instability zzso and cancer zzso These techniques should prove useful to other zzso researchers, as they are broadly zzso to many other biological investigations of zzso larvae, and adult zzso
