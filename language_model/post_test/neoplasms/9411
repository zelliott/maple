Proper repair of DNA damage is critical for protecting zzso stability, cellular viability and suppression of zzso Both zzso and zzso pathways have evolved to coordinate the cellular response following DNA zzso In this review, we highlight the importance of the zzso expressed protein zzso migration zzso factor zzso for an appropriate response to DNA zzso We discuss the mechanisms by which zzso affects the activity of the zzso system, and how this impacts on the integrity of the zzso and on zzso
