zzso zzso is a negative factor in cancer zzso In order to overcome the problem, various zzso have been investigated as an adjunct to zzso The use of hypoxic cell zzso is a classical strategy, and many new compounds have been developed and zzso Development of more efficient compounds than those currently available seems difficult and clinical studies to prove the efficacy of the existing compounds are zzso especially in combination with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which a single high dose of radiation is zzso Following the advent of hypoxic cell zzso hypoxic zzso have become zzso Among them, zzso has already gained success when combined with zzso in zzso cell lung zzso The beneficial effect of zzso when combined with radiation needs to be zzso As a third-generation compound in this field, zzso zzso that are activated by zzso under hypoxic conditions via zzso reduction have been zzso zzso of zzso and zzso have shown in zzso as well as in zzso zzso Although clinical evaluation of the compounds is not warranted due to a relatively low in zzso effect, this strategy appears promising if the zzso design can be applied to more potent agents that shall be developed in zzso
