Local radiation of tumor masses is an established zzso for the therapy of a range of human zzso It has recently been recognized that doses of radiation, lower than or equal to those that cause direct zzso may alter the zzso of target tissue by zzso gene products that may make tumor cells more susceptible to zzso immune zzso Previously, we demonstrated that radiation increased zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cells, which consequently enhanced their zzso to zzso zzso zzso The present study was designed to determine whether these phenomena also occur with human tumor zzso Here, 23 human zzso cell lines (12 zzso 7 zzso and 4 zzso were examined for their response to zzso doses of radiation (10 or 20 zzso zzso hours zzso changes in surface expression of zzso zzso as well as expression of other surface molecules involved in zzso immune attack such as zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso class I, were zzso zzso of the 23 zzso cell lines zzso one or more of these surface molecules zzso Furthermore, five of five zzso zzso colon tumor cells lines demonstrated significantly enhanced killing by zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso We then used zzso analysis to broaden the scope of observed changes in gene expression after radiation and found that many additional genes had been zzso These zzso gene products may additionally enhance the tumor zzso zzso to zzso immune attack or serve as additional targets for zzso Overall, the results of this study suggest that zzso doses of radiation can be used to make human tumors more amenable to immune system recognition and attack and form the rational basis for the zzso use of cancer vaccines and local tumor zzso
