zzso cells play a key role in the development and function of blood and zzso zzso zzso proliferation and transformation of zzso cells lead to pathological zzso or vascular malfunctions which are hallmarks of zzso zzso There is emerging evidence that circulating zzso zzso cells zzso also contribute significantly to these zzso Major progress has been achieved over the past few years in the identification of key molecules involved, and in targeting zzso zzso for human zzso Current research efforts are concentrated on deciphering the origin and functional properties of zzso in various zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The aim of these studies is to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso of zzso from bone zzso and their zzso and differentiation into mature zzso in zzso at sites of zzso as well as the role of viral zzso in regulating the plasticity and extending the life span of zzso zzso Integrated understanding of the mechanisms regulating the properties and function of zzso cells during zzso is resulting in the development of a number of exciting and bold approaches for the treatment of zzso
