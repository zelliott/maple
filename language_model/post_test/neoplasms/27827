The problem of point and zzso zzso following a Phase I trial, carried out according to the scheme outlined by zzso zzso and Fisher zzso zzso 46, zzso is zzso A zzso of the model suggested in this earlier work can be seen to be advantageous in some zzso zzso likelihood zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The continual reassessment method zzso restrictions on the sample space such that it is not possible for confidence intervals to achieve exact coverage properties, however large a sample is zzso Nonetheless, our simulations, based on a small finite sample of 20, not zzso in studies of this type, indicate that the calculated intervals are useful in most practical cases and achieve coverage very close to nominal levels in a very wide range of zzso The relative merits of the different zzso and their associated confidence zzso viewed from a zzso perspective, are zzso
