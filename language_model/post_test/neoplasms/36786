The zzso zzso is a major zzso in human zzso that can undergo zzso of the outer zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detects a different modification of the zzso zzso of the zzso group zzso zzso We found that conventional zzso of the zzso zzso is limited by a reduction in zzso upon fixation with zzso (which presumably react with the free zzso zzso or with organic zzso (which can extract zzso We zzso conditions for detection of this zzso in zzso frozen tissue sections and studied its distribution in human zzso and zzso It is expressed at low levels in a few blood vessels, zzso zzso cells in the skin and zzso and at moderate levels in skin zzso In contrast, the zzso accumulates at high levels in many zzso and in some zzso but not in zzso In positive zzso expression is sometimes more intense and widespread than that of zzso Both zzso and zzso of zzso seem to occur after its initial zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso were used to compare their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso predominantly on the cell surface and partly in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso has a diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicates that whereas zzso remains predominantly on the cell surface, zzso is efficiently zzso into a compartment that is distinct from zzso zzso up of melanoma cells occurring during growth in culture is associated with relocation of the internal pool of zzso to the cell zzso Thus, a minor modification of the polar head group of a zzso zzso can markedly affect the zzso zzso and trafficking of the whole zzso The high levels of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso its selective zzso from the cell surface, and its relocation to the cell surface of rounded up cells suggest potential uses in diagnostic or therapeutic approaches to these zzso
