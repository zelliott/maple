The ability of zzso via its zzso zzso IGF-1, to influence regulation of cellular growth has been the focus of much interest in recent zzso In this review, we will explore the association between zzso and zzso Available experimental data support the suggestion that zzso status may influence zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso data exist that also support a link between zzso status and cancer zzso zzso studies of patients with zzso indicate an increased risk of zzso cancer, although risk of other zzso is zzso and a long-term follow-up study of children deficient in zzso treated with zzso zzso has indicated an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso extensive studies of the outcome of zzso replacement in childhood cancer survivors show no evidence of an excess of de zzso zzso and more recent surveillance of children and adults treated with zzso has revealed no increase in observed cancer zzso However, given the experimental evidence that indicates zzso provides an zzso environment that may zzso survival of genetically damaged cells, longer-term surveillance is zzso over many years, even a subtle zzso in the environmental milieu in this direction, although not inducing cancer, could result in acceleration of zzso Finally, even if zzso therapy does result in a small increase in cancer risk compared to zzso patients with zzso zzso it is likely that the eventual risk will be the same as the general zzso Such a restoration to zzso will need to be balanced against the known morbidity of zzso zzso zzso
