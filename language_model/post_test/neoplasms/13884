The activity of zzso organizer regions zzso in the peripheral zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso or breast zzso was studied with a combined method of zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso were higher in zzso 15 and sum total from patients with lung cancer, lower in zzso 14 from patients with breast cancer, and lower in zzso 14 but higher in zzso 22 from patients with gastric cancer, as compared with those of zzso No significant variation of the zzso of zzso was found in the patients with zzso zzso The results indicate that a dominant zzso zzso model is shown in the patients with different zzso zzso the active expression of zzso genes may present a zzso concerning the location of zzso
