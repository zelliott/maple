This study describes the synthesis of zzso zzso composite zzso that can be potentially used simultaneously for cancer diagnosis and zzso The synthesis method was a zzso process wherein zzso zzso were mixed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared using a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a zzso core and a zzso exterior with both zzso segments and zzso acid groups, wherein the zzso zzso were coordinated and zzso According to zzso data, the ratio of zzso to zzso and the ratio of zzso to zzso are keys to controlling the size and thus, the stability of the composite zzso The magnetic measurement indicated that the composite zzso had zzso properties and high zzso zzso The preliminary magnetic resonance imaging showed that the particles produced an enhanced image even when their concentration was as low as 80 zzso
