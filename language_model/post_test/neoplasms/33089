To analyze cases of bacterial and zzso meningitis in patients with zzso 

zzso chart review from 1993 to 2004 was performed of patients with cancer at our institution who had positive zzso bacterial or zzso zzso 

We identified 312 positive zzso cultures representing 175 unique zzso zzso cultures were deemed zzso leaving 79 cultures for analysis in 77 zzso zzso had prior zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso None had zzso zzso or zzso zzso Two patients each had zzso zzso or zzso zzso Five percent of presentations demonstrated the zzso of fever, zzso zzso and mental status zzso Seventy-five percent of presentations demonstrated zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Median zzso zzso count was 74 zzso zzso protein was elevated and zzso was depressed in zzso In zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 4 had 0 to 1 zzso zzso and 2 had normal zzso VP shunt infections were more likely to present with mental status zzso Thirty day mortality was zzso 

Patients with cancer do not manifest symptoms of meningitis as often as patients without cancer and display a very different set of zzso organisms compared to a general zzso The zzso inflammatory response is muted in patients with cancer with zzso Most patients with cancer with meningitis have had prior zzso Additionally, the organisms causing meningitis in the cancer population have shifted over time, with a decline in the organisms which typically zzso zzso hosts and an increase in zzso zzso
