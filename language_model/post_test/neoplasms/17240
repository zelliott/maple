The zzso zzso in the X-ray zzso group 1 zzso had been implicated in cancer zzso The previous published data on the association between zzso zzso zzso and cancer risk remained zzso 

To derive a more precise zzso of the association between the zzso zzso zzso and overall cancer risk, we performed a zzso of 297 zzso studies, in which a total of zzso cases and zzso controls were zzso Overall, significantly increased cancer risk was observed in any genetic model zzso model: odds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model: OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso additive model: OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when all eligible studies were pooled into the zzso In further zzso and sensitivity zzso significantly elevated zzso and breast zzso risk were observed in Asians zzso model: OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in Indians zzso model: OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model: OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso additive model: OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso suggests the participation of zzso zzso is a genetic zzso for zzso cancer in Asians and breast cancer in zzso Moreover, our work also points out the importance of new studies for zzso association in some cancer types, such as zzso gastric cancer, and oral cancer, where at least some of the zzso responsible for zzso could be controlled, to obtain a more conclusive understanding about the function of the zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso
