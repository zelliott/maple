The introduction of functional data into the zzso treatment planning process is currently the focus of significant commercial, zzso scientific and clinical zzso The potential of such data from zzso zzso zzso zzso was recognized at an early stage and was integrated into the zzso treatment planning process through the use of image fusion zzso The combination of PET and CT in a single system zzso to form an inherently fused anatomical and functional zzso has provided an imaging zzso which could be used as the prime tool in the zzso of zzso volumes and the preparation of patient treatment plans, especially when integrated with virtual zzso PET imaging typically using zzso zzso can provide data on metabolically active zzso zzso These functional data have the potential to modify treatment volumes and to guide treatment delivery to cells with particular zzso zzso This paper reviews the current status of the integration of PET and zzso data into the zzso treatment zzso Consideration is given to the requirements of zzso data acquisition with reference to patient positioning aids and the limitations imposed by the zzso zzso It also reviews the approaches being taken to the definition of zzso volumes and the mechanisms available to measure and include zzso motion into the imaging zzso The use of PET data must be based upon a clear understanding of the interpretation and limitations of the functional zzso zzso for the zzso of this development remain to be zzso and outcomes data based upon clinical trials are still zzso
