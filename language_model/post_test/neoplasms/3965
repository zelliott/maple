The efficacy and safety of zzso in patients with cancer with pulmonary embolism is zzso Therefore we studied the effects of zzso in 57 patients with cancer and 254 patients without cancer who were treated in five clinical trials with tissue zzso zzso or zzso for pulmonary zzso Immediately after zzso the proportion of patients with and without cancer who improved on follow-up zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso was zzso The zzso reduction in zzso burden zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was somewhat greater in patients with cancer than in patients without zzso zzso hours after initiation of zzso therapy, the proportion of patients who improved on follow-up zzso scan continued to be similar zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso However, the extent of zzso at 24 hours was less in patients with cancer than in patients without cancer zzso vs zzso zzso of lung zzso p zzso zzso These data suggest that patients with cancer should receive effective zzso in the upper portion of the therapeutic range immediately after zzso It is possible that such a strategy might preserve initial improvement from zzso and prevent zzso of benefit during the ensuing 24 zzso
