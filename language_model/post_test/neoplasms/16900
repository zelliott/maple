The aim of the study was to examine a cohort of cases of childhood cancer occurring in a defined geographical area to try to identify zzso and possible zzso zzso 

Data were zzso using the close pair method developed by Knox for signs of zzso in relation to date and place of onset or date and place of zzso 

Cases were those occurring in the 8 year period between 1953 and 1960 in four old counties of the zzso of England zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso children under 10 years developed zzso during the study zzso zzso zzso cerebral zzso 99, zzso 45, zzso zzso It is thought that data collection was zzso Cases were matched for region, sex and date of birth with live zzso 

There was evidence among some age groups and diagnoses of an unexpectedly high number of close pairs of zzso and some indication of similar patterns among zzso of children who later developed zzso The zzso and zzso experiences of children involved in close pairs were examined to see whether they differed from those of control zzso zzso appeared to occur more often in the 2-3 years before the onset of zzso in children who were later involved in close pairs than in their matched zzso 

Common infectious diseases of childhood may play a minor role in the development of some zzso zzso of these diseases may then be reflected on a greatly reduced scale in the subsequent distribution of cancer zzso
