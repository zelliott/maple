Natural killer zzso cells are central zzso cells during innate immune responses against zzso Natural zzso receptors expressed by zzso cells such as zzso are involved in the recognition of transformed zzso Recently, the novel B7 family member zzso which is expressed on the cell surface of various tumor cells including zzso zzso was identified as an zzso zzso for zzso To investigate expression and regulation of zzso we generated zzso zzso Our study reveals that zzso surface protein and zzso zzso zzso expression in various tumor cell lines was zzso upon treatment with zzso or class I zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as after small interfering zzso zzso of the class I zzso zzso zzso 2 or zzso zzso zzso was associated with decreased zzso reporter activity and reduced zzso zzso at the zzso zzso In certain primary zzso and zzso zzso samples, zzso zzso levels were elevated and correlated with zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso on tumor cells by zzso reduced zzso zzso functions of zzso zzso Thus, we identified a novel mechanism that zzso zzso expression in tumor cells that has implications for potential cancer treatments combining zzso with zzso
