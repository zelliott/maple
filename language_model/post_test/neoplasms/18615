To describe the risk of cancer in patients exposed to tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso 

The following 2 clinical zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso a registry of patients suffering from rheumatic diseases exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso and 675 other rheumatic zzso and zzso zzso a cohort of zzso zzso patients not exposed to zzso zzso Cancer zzso rates zzso per 1000 zzso and zzso rate ratios zzso were calculated for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso over time in zzso zzso patients was analyzed by zzso zzso The zzso was estimated to compare cancer rates in exposed versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mortality ratios zzso zzso were also zzso zzso factors for cancer in patients exposed to zzso zzso were investigated by generalized linear zzso 

The zzso for cancer in zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso patients exposed to zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the adjusted zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso in patients with previous cancer was zzso zzso zzso zzso Age, chronic zzso pulmonary disease, and steroids were associated with a higher risk of developing zzso The zzso decreased after the first 4 months of exposure, without statistical zzso 

zzso cancer and mortality rates in patients with rheumatic diseases exposed to zzso zzso are no higher than in the background Spanish zzso However special attention should be paid to elderly patients, those with previous zzso and patients treated with zzso
