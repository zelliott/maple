The last decade has seen the introduction of advanced technologies that have enabled much more precise application of therapeutic zzso These relatively new technologies include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso planning, and intensity modulated zzso in zzso zzso dose zzso have become more zzso to volumes of disease, sometimes utilizing sharp dose zzso to deliver high doses to target volumes while sparing nearby zzso zzso Thus, accurate patient positioning has become even more important, so that the treatment delivered to the patient matches the virtual treatment plan in the computer treatment planning zzso zzso and zzso radiation therapy systems offer the potential to improve the precision of patient treatment by providing a more robust zzso system than is typically used in conventional zzso The ability to accurately position internal targets relative to the zzso zzso and to provide real-time patient tracking theoretically enables significant reductions in the amount of normal tissue zzso This report reviews the concepts, technology, and clinical applications of optical tracking systems currently in use for zzso radiation zzso zzso of zzso optical tracking technology to respiratory gating and the monitoring of implanted zzso markers are also zzso
