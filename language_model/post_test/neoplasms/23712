Human zzso and zzso zzso have the capability of enhancing the expression of major zzso zzso I and class II zzso and zzso as well as other surface tumor associated zzso zzso on cancer cell zzso This zzso associated to the zzso effect observed both in zzso and in zzso was the basis of the extended use of zzso in cancer zzso Despite the great expectations, several solid zzso resulted resistant to treatment with zzso In order to analyze the actual effects of zzso on cancer, we treated primary cultures of different zzso of cancer cell, which are well known to differ significantly from established cell lines, with escalating doses of zzso In this paper, we demonstrate that a variable proportion of culture was able to zzso the expression of zzso and zzso molecules on the zzso This finding suggests that a clear functional zzso was present in primary cultures of cancer cells, that strictly reflected the in zzso zzso In addition, it is of note that in some zzso zzso zzso zzso was more effective than zzso human zzso in the induction of this zzso
