zzso a zzso gene family member, plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, cell zzso and cell zzso Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso and differentiation of stem zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying this biological process remains largely zzso In the present review, we summarized the function of zzso as a zzso regulator of gene zzso with particular reference to stem zzso
