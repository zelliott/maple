There is emerging evidence of the production in human tumors of abnormal levels of zzso zzso which have been assigned zzso and/or zzso zzso While some zzso commonly exhibit altered amounts across tumors, more often, different tumor types produce unique patterns of zzso related to their tissue of zzso The role of zzso in zzso underscores their value as zzso therapeutic targets in zzso Similarly, unique patterns of altered levels of zzso production provide fingerprints that may serve as molecular zzso for tumor diagnosis, zzso prognosis of zzso outcomes and prediction of therapeutic zzso
