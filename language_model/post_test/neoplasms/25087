DNA zzso acts in concert with other zzso mechanisms to regulate normal gene expression and facilitate zzso organization within zzso zzso DNA zzso patterns are acquired during zzso zzso such events are often accompanied by zzso in zzso structure at gene regulatory zzso The expression pattern of any given gene is achieved by interacting zzso zzso First, the zzso of zzso at zzso start sites prevents the binding of the zzso machinery and additional zzso that initiate gene zzso Second, zzso anchor all of the zzso and zzso zzso proteins in the cell, which suggests a role for zzso zzso in the establishment of DNA zzso zzso During zzso zzso switching and zzso zzso result in the zzso zzso of zzso islands, reducing zzso plasticity of critical zzso and tumor zzso zzso rendering them unresponsive to normal zzso Here, we will discuss the importance of both established and novel molecular concepts that may zzso the role of DNA zzso in zzso
