zzso plays a critical role in the maintenance of zzso zzso regulatory T cells zzso in zzso We examined the effects of zzso signaling in human zzso In zzso zzso selectively zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso T cells but not in zzso zzso This regulation involved the binding of zzso and zzso proteins to a highly zzso zzso site located in the first zzso of the zzso zzso We also examined the effects of zzso zzso treatment in 12 patients with zzso cancer and 9 patients with chronic zzso leukemia after zzso zzso stem cell zzso Overall, zzso treatment resulted in a zzso median fold increase in the frequency of zzso cells in peripheral blood as well as a zzso median fold increase in zzso expression in zzso T zzso zzso natural killer zzso cells also expanded during zzso therapy but did not express zzso In zzso treatment of zzso cells with zzso restored the zzso signaling zzso leading to zzso zzso suggesting that this gene was zzso zzso by DNA zzso in these zzso Our findings support the clinical evaluation of zzso zzso to selectively zzso zzso zzso and increase expression of zzso in zzso
