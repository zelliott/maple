Many statistical models focus on a random variable that represents time until failure and an indicator variable that denotes type of zzso When zzso mechanisms are introduced, an incomplete observation on the failure time often zzso observation of the zzso In addition to conventional zzso for which observations on the time until failure and the type of failure are both complete or both incomplete, this paper considers zzso zzso for which only one of the random variables if fully zzso An zzso zzso yields zzso estimates of the joint law governing this random zzso these estimates zzso to the maximum likelihood zzso Recent developments permit approximations to the information and zzso zzso Several special cases lead to zzso estimates of the underlying zzso Data from two recent clinical trials are used to illustrate the proposed zzso
