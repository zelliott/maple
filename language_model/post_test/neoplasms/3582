zzso zzso a third-generation zzso agent, is currently being evaluated in a phase II clinical trial in head and neck cancer patients and in a phase I clinical trial in combination with zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso and biological zzso of zzso alone as well as the potential zzso interaction between zzso and zzso 

In the phase II study, zzso was given alone as a zzso zzso infusion at 60 zzso weekly for 4 weeks with the cycle repeated after a zzso zzso In the concurrent phase I combination trial zzso was also given as a zzso zzso infusion, but followed by a zzso zzso infusion of zzso weekly for 4 weeks with the cycle repeated after a zzso zzso The clinical zzso of zzso alone and in combination with zzso were investigated in the first cycle of each treatment zzso The platinum levels in zzso plasma zzso zzso and urine were measured by a fully validated zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso zzso 

In the ten patients receiving zzso alone, the zzso profiles of total platinum exhibited a zzso decline both in plasma and in zzso The peak levels of platinum were zzso zzso in plasma and zzso zzso in zzso at the end of the zzso infusion, and the platinum levels were still zzso at zzso zzso 94 h after the zzso zzso The mean terminal zzso values of total platinum in plasma and in zzso were zzso h and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso platinum represented about zzso of that of the total plasma zzso The platinum levels in the DNA fraction of peripheral white blood cells zzso correlated with the platinum levels in zzso ( zzso zzso In the phase I combination study, the dose level of zzso was escalated from 35 zzso to 60 zzso The zzso profiles of platinum in the combination trial also showed zzso zzso in plasma and in zzso as exhibited by zzso zzso However, the terminal elimination rate constant zzso of total plasma platinum increased at all dose levels of zzso when combined with zzso at 45 zzso ( zzso A zzso increase in clearance zzso of total plasma platinum was observed at the zzso dose level of 45 zzso in combination with zzso at 45 zzso No statistically significant difference in the zzso urinary elimination of total platinum was detected between the combination groups and the zzso zzso The zzso values of total platinum in zzso were zzso to zzso doses ranging from 35 to 60 zzso whether zzso was given alone or in combination with zzso 

zzso clearance may be enhanced by zzso when the two agents are used in combination in zzso The zzso zzso level in peripheral zzso was found to be a good indicator for zzso exposure in patients, and should be further exploited for potential tumor drug zzso
