zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso form a still growing family of about 40 type 1 zzso zzso They are defined by a common modular zzso architecture that combines cell zzso and fusion motifs zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso domain capped by a large zzso Their zzso thus zzso resembles snake zzso zzso zzso which by combined zzso blocking and zzso zzso can cause extensive tissue damage after snake zzso A surprisingly large proportion (13 zzso is exclusively expressed in the male zzso and only a minority can be found throughout all zzso As predicted by their zzso acid zzso a major proportion of this family has not maintained a functional zzso domain, most probably rendering them into pure zzso and/or fusion zzso For most zzso the respective key function has remained zzso Despite their overall zzso zzso structure, zzso appear to be subdivided into those with a zzso role in direct zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3) and those mainly acting as zzso zzso zzso 10 and zzso Only for a few of them are functions of more than one domain documented zzso zzso in cell fusion and zzso Several zzso exist in both zzso and zzso zzso the functional significance of this zzso is in most cases still zzso zzso zzso have been zzso only in a few cases zzso 1, 2, 10, 12, 15, 17, and zzso and are mainly related to their zzso zzso A common zzso of zzso zzso is the zzso shedding of a broad spectrum of zzso including zzso growth factors like zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso cell zzso molecules like zzso or zzso and the initiation of regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the respective zzso is further zzso by an zzso zzso zzso to release an zzso domain acting as a nuclear zzso zzso Most zzso feature a significant overlap of zzso zzso explaining why an zzso of individual zzso only rarely causes major zzso
