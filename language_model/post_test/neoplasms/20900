zzso patients with cancer report levels of function similar to other chronic zzso Scores on physical function varied by site of zzso the pattern of change was similar among zzso Age, zzso treatment zzso and symptom reports each had an independent effect on loss of zzso zzso breast cancer patients had lower zzso suggesting a possible treatment zzso
