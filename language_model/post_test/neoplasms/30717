zzso have been advanced as zzso for the zzso therapy of cancer and selectively zzso derivatives have shown promise as tumor imaging zzso In order to study the effect of the degree of zzso on their zzso pattern, we prepared a series of zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso of metal free zzso with zzso gave zzso which zzso on further zzso whereas zzso of zzso with zzso acid zzso following zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso gave stable zzso The distribution pattern of the zzso among human plasma proteins was strongly affected by the degree of zzso of the zzso The lower zzso zzso showed significant binding to the various zzso zzso whereas increased zzso favored association to zzso The use of the zzso allowed for the validation of zzso zzso of zzso in biological samples and confirmed the in zzso stability of the zzso zzso
