zzso drugs have been used for many years to relieve zzso zzso zzso offers one option for delivering and maintaining pain relief in patients with moderate or severe cancer zzso 

To determine the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso for relief of cancer pain, and to assess the adverse events associated with the use of zzso zzso for relief of cancer zzso 

The following databases were zzso Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso (The Cochrane Library zzso zzso 4 of zzso zzso zzso to May zzso zzso zzso to May zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Published zzso controlled trials zzso using zzso or active zzso reporting on the zzso effect of zzso zzso in adults and children with cancer zzso Studies with fewer than 10 participants were zzso 

Data were extracted independently by two review zzso We extracted any available data on the number or proportion of patients with zzso worse than mild zzso or treatment success zzso satisfied, or very good or excellent on patient global impression zzso together with information about adverse events and zzso 

We identified nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria, including a Turkish study that is awaiting formal zzso There were zzso participants zzso in classically designed zzso of whom zzso had zzso data, and 138 patients enrolled in an enriched zzso zzso withdrawal zzso zzso Overall, 600 participants were treated with zzso zzso patches, 382 with various zzso of zzso 36 with zzso and 221 with zzso plus zzso There were major sources of potential bias, including lack of zzso small size, high levels of attrition, and inconsistent zzso could not compare data in a meaningful analysis regarding adverse events such as zzso abdominal pain, gastrointestinal zzso and zzso These events may have been attributable to the underlying disease zzso were insufficient comparable data for zzso to be undertaken or to produce numbers needed to treat zzso for the zzso zzso In seven studies with 461 participants reporting pain intensity results after about two weeks, the mean or median pain scores were on the borderline of mild and moderate zzso Most participants would have had no worse than mild pain on zzso Another reported that zzso of participants using zzso zzso had an undefined successful zzso Fewer participants experienced zzso with zzso zzso zzso than with oral zzso zzso giving a risk ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso to prevent zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

The zzso trial literature for effectiveness of zzso zzso is zzso but it is an important zzso Most studies recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide data appropriate for zzso Only a few reported how many patients had good pain relief but, where data were reported, a majority had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time zzso The evidence pointed to a useful and significant reduction in complaints about zzso for zzso zzso compared with oral zzso
