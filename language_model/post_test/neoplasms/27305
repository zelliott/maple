zzso of the mouse zzso allows zzso of the genetic defects that give rise to human zzso and evaluation of the cooperating nature of different zzso in the transformation of distinct cell zzso Here we review the generation of mice with specific zzso zzso in zzso zzso and disruption of the zzso zzso by deletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the DNA binding domain result in viable mice with zzso and dominant negative zzso Loss of either of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso gives rise to a zzso embryonic lethal zzso A cell can thus tolerate the absence of zzso function but not excess zzso function, a characteristic that is being exploited in the treatment of human zzso
