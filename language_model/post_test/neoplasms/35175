To impact on the development of clinical zzso heart failure as a complication of zzso therapy, left zzso ejection fraction was monitored with serial resting zzso zzso in zzso patients with cancer over a seven-year period in both university and community hospital zzso A high-risk subset of 282 patients was selected for retrospective analysis of their clinical zzso zzso patients were identified by one or two of the following three criteria: decline of 10 percent or more in absolute left zzso ejection fraction from a normal baseline to 50 percent or less; high cumulative dose of zzso (more than 450 zzso abnormal baseline left zzso ejection fraction (less than 50 zzso Clinical zzso heart failure occurred in 46 (16 percent) during the treatment period, and in an additional three patients zzso percent) at last follow-up examination zzso zzso zzso months following zzso of zzso Total cumulative zzso of zzso that zzso zzso heart failure (75 to zzso zzso and those that did not (30 to 880 zzso varied zzso zzso of 10 percent or more in absolute left zzso ejection fraction to a value of 50 percent or less preceded administration of the final dose of zzso that zzso clinical zzso heart failure in the majority of patients in whom zzso heart failure zzso Clinical zzso heart failure improved in 87 percent given routine therapy with zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso for monitoring left zzso ejection fraction and zzso zzso were zzso The occurrence of clinical zzso heart failure was compared in those patients whose management was zzso with proposed criteria zzso zzso and in those whose management was not zzso zzso Group A had a lower zzso of zzso heart failure compared with Group B zzso percent versus zzso percent, p less than zzso and had only mild zzso heart failure that resolved with treatment zzso zzso 2) and no deaths due to zzso heart zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a fourfold reduction in the zzso of zzso heart failure independent of other clinical predictor variables in those patients whose management was zzso with proposed zzso zzso The zzso zzso late development, zzso and zzso of clinical zzso heart failure were comparable in university and community hospital zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
