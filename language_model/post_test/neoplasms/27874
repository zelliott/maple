zzso of virus induced zzso by adoptive transfer of virus specific zzso T cells zzso is now feasible in experimental zzso zzso These zzso recognize viral zzso sequences of defined length presented in the groove of zzso class I zzso zzso zzso of large zzso masses requires zzso of zzso In essence, T cell immunity against virus induced zzso does not differ from zzso T cell immunity in zzso zzso escape strategies are numerous but, in various instances, can be zzso by defined zzso zzso of zzso responses against poorly zzso zzso induced zzso (the majority of human zzso requires novel strategies to overcome T cell zzso Rather than waiting to see whether zzso specific zzso (against unknown zzso can be cultured from zzso we propose an alternative strategy in which zzso are raised against target molecules of choice, including differentiation zzso of restricted tissue distribution zzso or zzso zzso zzso The various steps proposed include: zzso identification of target molecules of choice; zzso identification in these target molecules of zzso zzso specific zzso motifs involved in zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso evaluation of actual binding of such peptides to specific zzso class I zzso zzso in zzso zzso response induction by such zzso presented either by highly efficient zzso presenting cells (such as processing defective cells, which carry empty zzso class I zzso loaded with a single zzso or by zzso cells, both cell types being capable of primary zzso response induction in zzso and zzso adoptive transfer of zzso specific zzso generated in zzso or, more zzso vaccination with zzso zzso The latter possibility seems to be feasible because zzso vaccination with a single zzso viral zzso can install zzso memory and zzso protection against lethal virus zzso
