The present experiment was undertaken to study what types of human zzso are responsive to the zzso effects of zzso The human zzso cells used were as zzso cervical cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso transformed zzso zzso zzso zzso five myeloma cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso virus nuclear zzso positive zzso cells zzso The cells were treated with 25 to 100 zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso and two human myeloma cells zzso and zzso was remarkably zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso two other myeloma cell lines zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was moderately zzso In order to confirm part of the results obtained from in zzso experiments, in zzso experiments were also zzso The growth of zzso cells transplanted zzso into nude mice was significantly suppressed by intravenous injection of zzso We discussed the possibility that certain types of human zzso the growth of which seemed to be more or less dependent on zzso growth factors, might be sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso
