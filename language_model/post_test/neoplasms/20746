The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in zzso of human primary breast, zzso and colon zzso whereas it is not usually expressed in zzso zzso We developed a novel reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso tumor cells in zzso zzso The zzso was set up by increasing the amount of zzso step by step in the zzso zzso The highest sensitivity and specificity were found when using 800 zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso blood samples from 91 patients with either colon zzso lung zzso or breast (23) zzso and from 38 healthy volunteers were zzso zzso transcripts were found in 44 of 75 zzso patients with zzso zzso and in 4 of 38 zzso healthy donors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso 19, and zzso zzso zzso in blood samples from patients with zzso colon zzso was zzso zzso zzso 19, and zzso zzso transcripts were found in 8 of 11 zzso 3 of 11 zzso and 5 of 11 zzso patients, zzso Furthermore, two of seven zzso zzso B and five of nine zzso zzso C colon zzso patients were found to express zzso zzso in the peripheral zzso All patients that expressed zzso transcripts in the peripheral blood were found to express the zzso protein in the corresponding primary zzso as assessed by zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso that we developed is a highly specific and sensitive technique to detect circulating tumor cells in patients affected by different zzso zzso
