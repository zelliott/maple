Recent progress in the development of zzso imaging technologies should allow molecular imaging to play a major role in the field of gene zzso These tools have recently been validated in gene therapy models for continuous quantitative monitoring of the zzso zzso and time variation of gene delivery and/or zzso This article reviews the use of zzso magnetic zzso and optical imaging technologies, as they have been used in imaging gene delivery and gene expression for gene therapy zzso The studies published to date lend support that zzso imaging tools will help to accelerate zzso model zzso as well as allow for clinical monitoring of human gene zzso
