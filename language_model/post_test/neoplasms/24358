To generate zzso digital zzso zzso and reference zzso images for three-dimensional zzso radiation therapy zzso as an alternative to conventional portal imaging or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Three clinical cases zzso zzso and zzso were selected to illustrate the capabilities of zzso zzso for zzso zzso reference zzso images were reconstructed from digitally reconstructed zzso zzso from planning CT image zzso The effect of scan angle on zzso slice thickness was examined by computing the mutual information between zzso zzso and zzso images, as the zzso scan angle was varied from 0 degrees to 165 degrees zzso A zzso zzso acquisition strategy was implemented to remove respiratory motion zzso 

Digital zzso slices appeared similar to zzso zzso planes and yielded substantially more zzso information than either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso acquisition improved zzso visibility by suppressing respiratory zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso visibility in zzso images is likely to improve target zzso compared with zzso zzso techniques and might allow for daily zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential alternative to zzso zzso for sites prone to respiratory zzso
