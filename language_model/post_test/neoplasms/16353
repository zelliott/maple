Both zzso and zzso zzso adults are prone to zzso Studies of zzso replacement have, for the most part, demonstrated increases in bone mineral density zzso Previous studies have, however, used zzso doses in excess of those currently used in zzso zzso regimens aimed at zzso the serum zzso zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso on the zzso spine that has been zzso during treatment of childhood cancer is zzso 

zzso adult patients with zzso zzso zzso were subdivided according to whether or not they had received spinal zzso in zzso The cohort in whom the spine had not been zzso was comprised of 17 patients zzso male, 10 zzso median age zzso years zzso zzso the median age at primary pathological diagnosis being 9 years zzso zzso The cohort who received spinal zzso was composed of 15 patients zzso male, eight zzso median age zzso years zzso zzso with a median age at zzso zzso of 9 years zzso zzso 

At zzso zzso was assessed at the zzso spine and zzso neck by zzso and at the zzso and zzso radius by zzso The patients were then commenced on zzso replacement, zzso the dose at zzso intervals to zzso the serum zzso zzso zzso scans were zzso following at least 1 year of zzso replacement zzso The mean duration of zzso therapy was zzso plus minus zzso zzso 

zzso was significantly reduced, compared to the reference data, at all four sites measured in both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso No significant difference was observed between the zzso with respect to zzso spine zzso zzso zzso zzso In the cohort who did not receive spinal zzso an increase in zzso of zzso above baseline was observed at the zzso spine zzso zzso zzso zzso patients showing a positive zzso in zzso spine zzso No significant changes in zzso were observed at any other site within this zzso or at any site in the patients who received spinal zzso A significantly greater change in zzso spine zzso was observed in the zzso spine cohort compared with the zzso zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso No differences in response were demonstrated at the other sites studied between the two zzso 

We have demonstrated an increase in zzso spine zzso with long-term zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy in adults with zzso zzso zzso who have not received spinal zzso when zzso was administered by a zzso regimen aimed at zzso the serum zzso zzso No improvements were observed at the zzso neck, zzso or zzso zzso Patients who had received spinal zzso during childhood did not present with a reduction in spinal zzso in excess of that observed in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso group were, however, resistant to the zzso effects of zzso which we propose reflects the capacity of zzso damage to suppress the skeletal zzso
