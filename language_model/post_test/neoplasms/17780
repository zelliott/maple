To further study zzso relationship between daily mortality and particulate air pollution, to provide scientific basis for making zzso 

We applied zzso model to daily zzso data for zzso city, China from zzso using concentration of particulate matter less than 10 zzso in aerodynamic diameter zzso as the exposure measure, and controlling zzso factors, such as season, meteorological factors, zzso other air zzso zzso 

The zzso model showed a zzso relationship for the relative risks of death for all causes zzso zzso and for specific causes in relation to zzso zzso and obtained threshold zzso For total zzso zzso tumor mortality and zzso zzso the threshold levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively using the value of differential zzso 

Our zzso models are appropriate for assessing the effect of particulate air pollution on daily mortality at current ambient levels in zzso zzso contrast to those of Europe and zzso
