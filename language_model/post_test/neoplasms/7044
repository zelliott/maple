Cancer chemotherapy complexity ranges from the routes that the drug must follow before reaching the tumor site zzso to the drug effects on tumor depletion zzso Previous researchers, in their majority, have focused either on the zzso zzso or on the zzso zzso aspects of zzso Moreover, models that account for the molecular mechanisms of cancer development have limited scope in addressing the protein signals involved in tumor zzso For instance, the recently developed models for the zzso network, for which a number of zzso have been reported, must be integrated for further understanding of the zzso Here, we propose an integrated model that is composed of a zzso zzso representation for drug therapy that incorporates zzso and cell cycle zzso In particular, the dynamics of zzso and its network zzso such as zzso zzso zzso are modeled under drug zzso The results show that the proposed model is a realistic representation of the zzso expectations in a zzso zzso zzso
