The discovery of the biological relevance of zzso zzso molecules represents one of the most significant advances in contemporary molecular zzso It has turned out that a major fraction of the zzso part of the zzso is zzso zzso small zzso (including zzso more and more data are disclosed concerning long zzso zzso of 200 zzso to 100 zzso length that are implicated in the regulation of several basic molecular processes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effects, zzso Some of these long zzso zzso have been associated with human zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso the different expression of which has been noted in various zzso relative to healthy zzso Long zzso zzso may represent novel markers of molecular zzso and they might even turn out to be targets of therapeutic zzso
