This review highlights selective zzso zzso zzso zzso as emerging agents in late-stage clinical development for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting associated with zzso 

Muscle zzso including a loss of skeletal muscle, is a zzso symptom that begins early in the progression of cancer and affects a patient's quality of life, ability to tolerate chemotherapy, and zzso zzso increase muscle mass and improve physical function in healthy and diseased individuals, and potentially may provide a new therapy for muscle wasting and cancer zzso zzso zzso the same anabolic pathways targeted with classical zzso zzso but within the dose range in which expected effects on muscle mass and function are seen zzso zzso on zzso skin, and hair have not been zzso Unlike testosterone, zzso are orally active, zzso zzso and zzso anabolic zzso 

Recent clinical efficacy data for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso a zzso zzso is the most well characterized zzso and has consistently demonstrated increases in lean body mass and better physical function across several populations along with a lower hazard ratio for survival in cancer zzso zzso in May zzso results for the Phase III clinical trials entitled Prevention and treatment Of muscle zzso in zzso with zzso zzso and zzso evaluating zzso for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in patients with zzso cell lung cancer will be available soon, and will potentially establish a zzso zzso as the first drug for the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting in cancer zzso
