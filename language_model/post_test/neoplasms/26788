zzso taken from individual zzso exhibit extensive differences in their cellular composition due to the inherent zzso of zzso and vagaries of sample zzso As a result genes expressed in specific cell types, or associated with certain biological processes are detected at widely variable levels across samples in zzso zzso This zzso also means that the level of expression of genes expressed specifically in a given cell type or process, will vary in line with the number of those cells within samples or activity of the pathway, and will therefore be correlated in their zzso 

Using a novel zzso network-based approach we have zzso six large human cancer zzso zzso derived from more than 1,000 zzso Based upon this analysis, and without needing to isolate the individual cells, we have defined a broad spectrum of zzso and zzso gene signatures present in cancer expression data which were also found to be largely zzso in a number of independent zzso 

The zzso signature of the zzso zzso is shown to be zzso of zzso cell zzso All zzso cell signatures have some degree of correlation with each other, since they must all be zzso correlated with the zzso zzso However, viewed in the context of established zzso the interactions between zzso components appear to be zzso given the level of one component zzso zzso does not correlate tightly with another, such as the zzso
