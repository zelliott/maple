Recent studies have shown that zzso play an important part in both tumor initiation and various key steps in growth and zzso These cells show a remarkable degree of plasticity during tumor development with a zzso in zzso zzso occurring during the course of tumor zzso During chronic inflammation they appear to zzso a given tissue to tumor initiation by the release of factors that promote zzso zzso Following this, their zzso shifts more toward one that is zzso and supports tumor growth, zzso and zzso In this review, we discuss the evidence for this plasticity of zzso functions, the specific signaling mechanisms that may be regulating it, and the new targets for zzso therapies highlighted by these zzso
