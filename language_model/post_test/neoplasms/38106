Although the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso has been known as the zzso of the toxicity of particular zzso such as the zzso the normal role of this zzso factor in a number of biological processes is just beginning to be zzso zzso of zzso genes and signaling pathways indicates involvement of zzso in fundamental zzso zzso Noted defects in the zzso and functions of certain zzso in the absence of zzso point to critical roles for this protein in zzso zzso Together, the data suggest that the zzso has an important function in controlling the balance among processes involved in cell zzso death, and differentiation rather than being essential for zzso On the other hand, deregulation of these processes is known to contribute to events such as tumor zzso promotion, and progression that ultimately lead to zzso tumor zzso zzso and experimental animal data, along with a more detailed understanding of how zzso is involved in regulating particular signaling zzso provide substantial support for an association between abnormal zzso function and zzso Here we describe the current understanding of how the zzso may function to regulate both normal and zzso tissue growth and zzso
