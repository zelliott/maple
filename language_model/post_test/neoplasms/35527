The purpose of this study was to review the literature concerning upper zzso deep zzso zzso zzso diagnosed by color zzso duplex zzso zzso in cancer patients with zzso central zzso zzso zzso 

From computerized databases zzso and zzso relevant publications regarding zzso of the upper limb veins in cancer patients with zzso were zzso 

Patients with zzso have a higher rate of zzso which is increased by the presence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients showed zzso zzso in zzso to zzso of zzso In symptomatic cancer patients, the range was similar to the zzso ones, zzso to zzso The presence of a zzso almost doubled the zzso of zzso in symptomatic zzso Color zzso duplex zzso is an accurate examination for the diagnosis of zzso with sensitivity ranging from zzso to zzso and specificity ranging from zzso to zzso The main obstacle for the diagnosis of zzso is the presence of zzso bones, making it difficult to zzso and impossible to directly assess by zzso zzso Color and spectral zzso zzso and the use of small zzso aid in the zzso When several parameters are evaluated in zzso zzso is a reliable method for diagnosing zzso zzso 

Great zzso in the prevalence of zzso zzso in cancer patients has been reported, although it is zzso higher compared with patients without zzso Color zzso duplex zzso is the zzso of choice for the diagnosis of zzso zzso in symptomatic cancer patients and for screening for zzso zzso in this specific zzso
