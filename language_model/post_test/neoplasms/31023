zzso protein zzso is a highly zzso gene that maps to human zzso band zzso This gene contains an imperfect zzso repeat which encodes a string of zzso We previously detected a specific zzso zzso within this region of the gene in 10 of 21 sporadic zzso cell zzso Here, we report the detection of the same zzso in 5 of 21 zzso cell zzso of the head and neck, 1 of 2 small cell lung cancer cell lines, 6 of 18 zzso cell lung zzso 9 of 22 breast tumors, and 5 of 13 prostate zzso This zzso was seen in several early stage tumors and may thus be an early event in zzso We also detected a zzso at zzso 53 of this gene in both primary and zzso tumors from one zzso Other zzso changes were observed in a few zzso zzso but their frequency was the same in both tumor and control samples, suggesting that many of these changes were zzso or zzso artifacts rather than zzso in the tumor cells zzso
