The expression of zzso the zzso zzso zzso that targets zzso for degradation, is commonly zzso in human zzso zzso is a negative regulator of the cell cycle that plays an important role in tumor zzso Loss of zzso secondary to enhanced zzso degradation results in uncontrolled proliferation and promotes tumor zzso In the present study the zzso implications of zzso are reviewed and the mechanisms that regulate its expression in different human zzso A review and analysis of the English literature was zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein levels was observed in many aggressive zzso and was commonly associated with zzso of zzso levels and loss of tumor zzso zzso is an independent zzso marker for zzso and overall survival and may provide additional zzso information to that provided by zzso zzso zzso zzso in experimental models resulted in zzso of zzso and arrested cellular zzso zzso in zzso expression have profound effects on cancer progression and may serve as an accurate and independent zzso zzso Thus, determination of levels of zzso and zzso by readily available zzso studies may be a useful tool in the assessment of zzso especially in patients with intermediate disease, and may potentially assist in the planning of zzso zzso zzso may be an attractive target for the development of novel zzso zzso
