zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso method that uses supervised machine learning to prioritize zzso zzso zzso detected in tumor sequencing zzso zzso zzso are a key mechanism by which important cellular behaviors, such as cell growth, zzso and survival, are disrupted in zzso However, only a fraction of the zzso zzso observed in tumor zzso are expected to be cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from their neutral zzso counterparts is currently a pressing problem in cancer zzso trains a Random Forest zzso on driver zzso from the zzso databases and uses background zzso substitution rates observed in tumor sequencing data to model tumor zzso passenger zzso Each zzso zzso is represented by quantitative features that fall into five major zzso zzso properties of zzso acid zzso scores derived from multiple sequence alignments of protein or zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso predicted properties of local protein zzso and zzso from the zzso feature zzso Both a software package and a Web server zzso of zzso are available to facilitate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from large, zzso zzso sequencing zzso After ranking candidate driver zzso with zzso the zzso of features describing each zzso can be used to suggest possible mechanism by which zzso alter protein activity in zzso This chapter details the application of both zzso of zzso to tumor sequencing zzso
