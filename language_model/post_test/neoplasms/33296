zzso gene expression data are often analyzed together with corresponding zzso response and clinical zzso of biological subjects, zzso patients' residual tumor sizes after chemotherapy or zzso levels at various stages of diabetic zzso Current zzso analysis cannot directly incorporate such quantitative zzso into the zzso zzso of gene zzso It will be quite useful if these clinical response data can be effectively summarized in the zzso zzso display so that important groups of genes can be intuitively discovered with different degrees of relevance to target disease zzso 

We introduced a novel zzso analysis approach, response projected zzso zzso which uses a zzso geometrical projection of response data to the gene expression zzso The projected response zzso which becomes the origin in the projected space, is then clustered together with the projected gene zzso based on their different degrees of association with the response zzso A zzso based zzso analysis is also performed to evaluate statistical tightness of identified gene zzso Our zzso analysis was applied to the in zzso zzso and zzso profiling data on the zzso cancer cell lines and the zzso gene expression study of zzso differentiation in zzso These zzso applications enabled us to identify many known and novel gene factors and their potential zzso associations which are highly relevant to the drug's zzso activities and zzso 

We have shown that zzso can effectively discover gene networks with different degrees of association with clinical zzso Performed on each zzso response projected zzso based on its degree of association with the response data, zzso effectively summarizes individual zzso association with zzso as well as their own expression zzso Thus, zzso greatly enhances the utility of zzso analysis on investigating zzso zzso gene expression data with quantitative zzso
