Cell culture systems allow the examination of cell populations in a functional zzso To simulate in zzso conditions as closely as possible freshly established cell strains are superior to permanent cell zzso Different aspects for the establishment of primary cell cultures obtained from various zzso are zzso zzso culture media supplemented with zzso additions, special supplements zzso factors, zzso and attachment zzso The proliferation rates of the attained cell strains were evaluated by determination of cell doubling zzso zzso for how to obtain a relatively high zzso efficiency zzso zzso in our series of 219 zzso of primary growth in zzso are zzso zzso Mechanical disintegration is superior to zzso zzso If mechanical treatment alone did not produce a sufficient number of viable cells, additional zzso with zzso revealed a higher number of zzso primary cultures than with zzso zzso zzso of cell cultures from normal and zzso zzso of zzso origin was superior in Leibovitz L 15 medium zzso of 87 zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and tumors were found to have shortest cell doubling times in zzso and zzso zzso (16 of 23 zzso zzso The media were supplemented with the zzso additions zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the cases special supplements like growth factors or hormones increased cell zzso although they were almost always not essential for cell zzso zzso zzso factors only rarely contributed to the initiation of primary zzso zzso The application of various culture conditions does not lead to a protocol optimal for all zzso for all zzso of the same type of zzso or for all tumor specimens of unique zzso
