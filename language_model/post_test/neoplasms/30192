Over the past two decades, gene therapy has garnered tremendous attention and is heralded by many as the ultimate cure to treat diseases such as cancer, viral infections, and inherited genetic zzso However, the therapeutic applications of zzso acids extend beyond the delivery of zzso DNA and subsequent expression of deficient gene products in diseased zzso Other strategies include zzso zzso and most notably zzso interference zzso zzso strategies bear great potential for the treatment of diseases that are caused by zzso zzso and zzso is a universal and extraordinarily efficient tool to knock down the expression of virtually any gene by specific degradation of the desired target zzso However, because of the hurdles associated with effective delivery of zzso acids across a cell zzso the initial euphoria surrounding zzso therapy soon zzso The ability of zzso to cross the plasma membrane is hampered by their size and highly negative zzso zzso zzso have long been the gold standard to overcome this barrier, but they are associated with severe zzso effects and possible zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso peptides that can zzso through the cell membrane independent of receptors and can transport cargo including zzso small organic zzso zzso and zzso represent a promising class of zzso delivery zzso This zzso focuses on zzso carrier systems for the cellular delivery of various types of therapeutic zzso acids with a special emphasis on zzso zzso We also emphasize the clinical relevance of this research through examples of promising in zzso zzso Although zzso are often derived from naturally occurring protein zzso zzso they can also be artificially zzso Because zzso typically include many positively charged zzso zzso those zzso interactions facilitate the formation of complexes between the carriers and the zzso One drawback of zzso delivery includes zzso of the cargo in zzso because zzso tends to be zzso zzso of fatty acids or zzso peptides to the zzso can overcome this zzso zzso can also lack specificity for a single cell type, which can be addressed through the use of targeting zzso such as zzso zzso that bind to specific zzso Researchers have also applied these strategies to zzso carrier systems for zzso zzso delivery, such as zzso or zzso but zzso tend to be less zzso than other delivery zzso
