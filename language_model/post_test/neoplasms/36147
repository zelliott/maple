Although the same simple laws govern cancer outcome zzso division repeated again and zzso each zzso has a different outcome before as well as after zzso zzso The zzso zzso model allows an assessment of tumor sensitivity to zzso This model presents some limitations in clinical practice because it does not take into account the interactions between zzso cells and zzso bystander cells (such as zzso cells, zzso immune zzso that zzso zzso and tumor growth zzso These interactions can lead to zzso and complex tumor growth which appears to be random but that is not since there is not so many tumors spontaneously zzso In this paper we propose to develop a deterministic approach for zzso growth dynamics using chaos zzso Various characteristics of cancer dynamics and tumor zzso can be explained using mathematical models of competing cell zzso
