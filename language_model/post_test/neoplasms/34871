Low molecular weight protein zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso involved in cell growth zzso Human acid zzso 1 zzso is genetically zzso and three common zzso segregating at the zzso locus on the short arm of zzso 2 give rise to six zzso Each zzso appears to zzso two zzso different zzso fast and slow, which are produced in zzso zzso Fast zzso are related with zzso organization, cellular organization, and zzso Slow zzso are associated with growth factor receptors and zzso In this study, zzso genetic zzso were determined by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso on 74 subjects with various zzso the control group was 236 healthy subjects randomly zzso With zzso zzso according to fast zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso subjects with cancer presented an increase of fast zzso concentration zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso relative to the control sample zzso The increase of fast zzso concentration increased the invasive capacity of cancer cells, whereas a decrease of slow zzso concentration in cancer did not cause growth zzso and so resulted in cancer cell zzso
