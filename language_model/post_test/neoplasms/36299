Unlike any other cell type, T cells have a unique potential to eliminate cancer cells and to eventually cure cancer zzso As a result, researchers have made extensive efforts over the past three decades to develop zzso with the potential to mount T cell responses against cancer zzso One way in which such T cell responses can be triggered is by vaccines and zzso potentially leading to zzso T cell clones and lasting zzso zzso they can be induced with the help of zzso proteins that either are expressed in zzso T cells by gene therapeutic means, or are delivered to patients as pharmaceuticals for temporary engagement of T zzso With both zzso technologies, zzso T cells can be engaged for cancer cell zzso regardless of T cell zzso specificity and with the prospect of bypassing both complex T cell regulation and frequent immune escape mechanisms of tumor zzso In this review, we will focus on zzso approaches for T cell engagement that currently are in clinical zzso zzso zzso patient T cells with genes zzso zzso T cell receptors or zzso fusion proteins will be compared to those temporarily engaging T cells by infused zzso zzso zzso zzso experience has recently been gained in the clinic with both technologies such that their fundamental differences can now be discussed on the basis of patient zzso
