The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso resistance zzso pattern, zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso and zzso function in drug-induced human zzso leukemia zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso were developed by exposing the parental zzso cells to zzso increasing zzso of zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Degrees of resistance were assessed in terms of zzso values in an zzso zzso and the zzso function was evaluated in terms of zzso 123 zzso zzso and zzso The percentage of cells undergoing zzso was determined by flow zzso after zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso expression were estimated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain zzso 

Three zzso zzso were established and revealed a zzso to zzso resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as compared to the parental cell zzso The highest zzso was expressed in zzso cells, which was overcome by the zzso zzso zzso A zzso The resistant zzso showed a decreased zzso and an increased zzso of zzso in proportion to the degree of resistance, and these were completely reversed in the presence of 8 zzso zzso The decreased zzso response in these cell lines was clearly associated with the degree of drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were highly expressed in both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressed lower levels of zzso zzso and zzso even though the cell line was established by exposing the parental zzso cells to zzso for longer (5 zzso than to the other two zzso (3 zzso 

zzso cells were able to acquire a high level of drug resistance by zzso the cells in the presence of certain zzso drugs, and acquisition of the resistance was relatively zzso The degrees of resistance to the zzso drugs were well correlated with the expressions of zzso zzso and functional zzso and were also associated with a decreased response to zzso
