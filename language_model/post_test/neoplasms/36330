zzso zzso To determine the feasibility and safety of zzso zzso zzso injection for conversion of human tumors into zzso zzso Associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind zzso most abundant zzso in zzso zzso studies indicated that injected zzso zzso insert into tumor cell zzso bind zzso and target tumor cells to zzso zzso zzso thereby converting tumors into zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso might have similar utility in zzso 

Eleven patients with advanced solid tumors received one zzso injection of zzso zzso 1 zzso or 10 zzso zzso zzso The primary zzso was zzso toxicity zzso within 4 zzso Secondary zzso included long-term zzso zzso zzso tumor response and zzso 

There were no zzso and no clinical or laboratory evidence of zzso or any other zzso Few patients had an unexpectedly long zzso 

zzso injection of zzso zzso is feasible and safe for inducing a protective zzso immune zzso
