zzso are zzso zzso responsible for generating zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso producing zzso oxygen species, and initiating and executing zzso zzso dysfunction has been observed to be an important hallmark of aging and zzso Because zzso DNA zzso is important in maintaining functionally competent zzso zzso of zzso zzso can affect energy production, zzso stress, and cell survival, which may contribute to aging and/or zzso This review outlines a variety of zzso zzso zzso identified in aging zzso and human zzso as well as recent advances in understanding the zzso role of zzso zzso in the aging process and cancer zzso zzso dysfunction zzso by zzso zzso in zzso could induce zzso in aging cells and some cancer cells with severe zzso zzso In addition, it could activate zzso retrograde signaling to zzso the expression of nuclear genes involved in a zzso shift from zzso to zzso facilitate cells to adapt to altered environments and develop resistance to zzso agents, or promote zzso properties of cancer zzso These findings suggest that zzso of zzso zzso zzso is not only an important contributor to human aging but also plays a critical role in cancer zzso
