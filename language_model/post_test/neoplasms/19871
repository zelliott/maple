World Health Organization zzso and the Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso working groups advocated standardized criteria for zzso assessment of solid tumors in response to zzso drug therapy in the 1980s and 1990s, zzso WHO criteria measure solid tumors in zzso whereas zzso zzso use only zzso which is considered to be more zzso zzso 2, zzso These criteria have been widely used as the only imaging zzso approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration zzso zzso In order to measure tumor response to zzso drugs on images with zzso therefore, a robust quality assurance zzso procedures and corresponding zzso phantom are zzso To address this need, the authors constructed a zzso zzso (for ultrasound zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso phantom using zzso zzso materials based on the limited number of target zzso required by zzso by revising a zzso US commercial phantom zzso The zzso in Lee et zzso demonstrates the procedures of phantom fabrication zzso In this article, all protocols are introduced in a zzso fashion beginning with procedures for preparing the silicone zzso for casting zzso test objects in the zzso followed by preparation of TM materials for zzso imaging, and finally construction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary purpose of this paper is to provide the protocols to allow anyone interested in independently constructing a phantom for their own zzso zzso procedures for tumor size zzso and zzso WHO and volume measurement results of test objects made at multiple institutions using this zzso phantom are shown in detail in Lee et zzso zzso
