The ability to grow and differentiate zzso cells zzso ex zzso has allowed their genetic manipulation to enhance immune zzso against tumor zzso Gene engineering of DC can be achieved with a variety of physical methods and using different viral zzso zzso or DNA zzso either alone zzso coated with zzso or using zzso or gene guns leads to T cell zzso while zzso expression is frequently zzso zzso and zzso zzso have proven to be highly efficient in DC genetic zzso and have been widely used in zzso zzso Other zzso like zzso zzso zzso virus and zzso virus zzso can also lead to foreign zzso expression in DC leading to immune cell zzso DC have been genetically engineered to provide zzso and high level of tumor zzso expression or to introduce genes that further enhance their immune zzso zzso The promising results from zzso animal models and from in zzso human immune cell culture systems have provided a strong rationale to initiate pilot clinical zzso Recently published or communicated clinical experiences and ongoing trials have used defined tumor zzso zzso zzso for prostate zzso and melanoma, zzso DNA zzso for breast or pancreatic cancer, zzso zzso tumor zzso gene modification for melanoma and small cell lung cancer, and zzso expression of zzso molecules for colon zzso These preliminary experiences suggest that genetically modified DC can safely induce T cell responses but few clinical zzso
