Many viral infections reach clinical significance in winter, when it is cold, relative humidity is lowest and vitamin D production from solar zzso zzso is at its zzso Several zzso diseases, such as multiple zzso type 1 diabetes zzso and zzso are linked to viral zzso Vitamin D, through induction of zzso which effectively zzso both bacterial and viral infections, may reduce the risk of several zzso diseases and zzso by reducing the development of viral zzso Some types of cancer are also linked to viral zzso The zzso with seemingly important risk from viral infections important in winter, based on correlations with increasing latitude in the United States, an index of zzso solar zzso dose and vitamin D, are zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer, Hodgkin's and zzso lymphoma, and, perhaps, gastric zzso The evidence examined includes the role of viruses in the zzso of these diseases, the geographic and seasonal variation of these diseases, and the time of life when vitamin D is effective in reducing the risk of zzso In general, the evidence supports the zzso However, further work is required to evaluate this zzso
