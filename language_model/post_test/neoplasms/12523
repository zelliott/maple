We aimed to form a risk prediction model to assess the probability of zzso death in cancer patients at the time of zzso The medical records and the relevant clinical parameters of cancer patients who died in or who were discharged from a teaching hospital between 1997 and 2000 zzso zzso zzso were reviewed to explore the zzso of zzso death, which later were verified zzso zzso zzso zzso Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group zzso performance status of four, short duration of disease (on a zzso zzso emergency admission, low zzso zzso value (on a linear zzso and zzso zzso zzso value greater than zzso zzso were significantly and independently associated with the risk of zzso zzso This model had a receiver operating characteristic area of zzso in the derivation cohort and zzso in the validation zzso Using readily available clinical zzso it is possible to devise an accurate and zzso risk prediction model for the zzso cancer zzso
