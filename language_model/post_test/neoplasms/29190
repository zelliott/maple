zzso of the tumor zzso play active roles in determining the zzso zzso The host cells and the cancer cells zzso via a large variety of soluble factors, whose effects on both partners determine the final outcome of the zzso zzso In this review, we focus on the interactions between cancer cells and zzso that are found in their proximity in the growing and progressing tumor and describe the roles of zzso in zzso such zzso zzso zzso zzso also termed zzso zzso were found recently to acquire properties that promote tumor development and zzso formation, as is also the case for specific members of the zzso zzso In this review, we suggest that there is a zzso zzso between tumor cells and zzso which leads via zzso activities to increased zzso This zzso is zzso by the fact that cancer cells release factors that enhance the ability of the zzso to zzso a variety of zzso zzso which then act back on the zzso cells to promote their zzso zzso and invasive zzso The zzso zzso also affect the tumor zzso leading to increased zzso and possibly to an elevated presence of zzso zzso in zzso Here, we describe these zzso interactions and the zzso that are involved in these zzso mainly the zzso pair but also other zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The overall findings suggest that zzso stand at the crossroads of zzso interactions that lead to increased zzso in many cancer zzso
