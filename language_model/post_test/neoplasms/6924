zzso drug delivery to zzso is now zzso as a key factor that limits the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso and penetration of therapeutic agents through avascular tissue are critically important processes if sufficient drug is to be delivered to be zzso The purpose of this study is to develop an in zzso model that will simulate the transport of the clinically used zzso drug zzso across zzso layers zzso in zzso Three cell lines were zzso zzso zzso colon zzso zzso zzso breast zzso and zzso zzso resistant and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso were cultured on zzso culture zzso to various thicknesses and zzso at various zzso zzso or 50 zzso was added to the top zzso The concentration of drug appearing in the bottom chamber was determined as a function of time by zzso The rate of drug penetration was zzso zzso to the thickness of the zzso The rate and extent of zzso penetration was no different in the presence of zzso cells expressing zzso compared to zzso zzso A mathematical model based upon the premise that the transport of zzso across cell membrane zzso occurs by a passive zzso mechanism of the drug between two membrane leaflets was zzso The mathematical model treats the zzso apparatus as a series of compartments and the zzso is treated as a series of cell zzso separated by small zzso zzso This model demonstrates good agreement between predicted and actual drug penetration in zzso and may be applied to the prediction of drug transport in zzso potentially becoming a useful tool in the study of optimal chemotherapy zzso
