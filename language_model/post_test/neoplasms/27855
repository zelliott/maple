The aim of this work was to combine computer methodology applied to zzso statistical calculations with liquid zzso results on the analyses of serum levels of retinol, zzso and zzso in healthy subjects and in patients with various zzso associated with certain tumor zzso Our results show that the serum levels of the vitamins studied differed in cancer patients in comparison to healthy zzso These results also confirm published data showing that serum variations are generally not characteristic of a specific tumor zzso without indicating if these variations are a cause or an effect of tumor zzso zzso zzso analysis taking into account the levels of all vitamins and tumor markers zzso however, enabled us to zzso the different tumors in five groups: zzso of the nervous system, zzso tract zzso zzso zzso and two groups of zzso system zzso This new approach may lead to the constitution of a data bank on the zzso of tumors, as well as a reference system for all analyses of serum levels of vitamins associated with tumor zzso
