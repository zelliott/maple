This paper reviews the current understanding of the vitamin zzso differentiation of zzso cells, which results in the generation of cells that acquire zzso mature zzso Examples of the criteria by which differentiation is recognized in each cell type are zzso and only those effects of zzso zzso zzso on cell proliferation and survival that are associated with the differentiation process are zzso The existing knowledge, often zzso of the signaling pathways that lead to vitamin zzso differentiation of zzso breast, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso leukemia cancer cells is zzso The important distinctions between the different mechanisms of zzso differentiation that are zzso and zzso specific are pointed out where zzso There is a considerable body of evidence that the principal human cancer cells can be suitable candidates for zzso or differentiation therapy with vitamin zzso However, further studies are needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms in order to improve the therapeutic zzso
