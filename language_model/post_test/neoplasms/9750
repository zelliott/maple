The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction of heat and chemotherapy in experimental whole body zzso zzso A vascular technique of zzso zzso was employed to rapidly elevate body temperature in rabbits carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than 41 degrees zzso was achieved in a mean time of 28 zzso zzso rabbits receiving zzso alone exhibited poor mean survival zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso animals (32 zzso and the group receiving IV zzso alone zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso zzso zzso with zzso was intermediate in terms of mean survival (30 days, zzso between the zzso alone and zzso alone zzso In this experimental model we have determined zzso to be a zzso form of cancer zzso Its action appears to enhance tumor zzso resulting in rapid animal zzso In light of these findings a zzso of clinical zzso may be zzso
