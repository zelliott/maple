zzso directed against triggering surface molecules expressed by T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso cells zzso zzso are able to induce the functional program of these zzso These zzso represent suitable zzso to construct zzso directed against zzso in order to specifically target zzso zzso against tumor zzso zzso zzso were constructed to specifically direct T zzso against zzso tumor zzso Such zzso are able to induce zzso of zzso tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso while tumor cells having low or absent expression of zzso were not zzso In addition, both zzso T zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to zzso zzso upon contact with zzso tumor zzso To target zzso cells against zzso resistant zzso zzso we used an zzso zzso zzso together with an zzso zzso zzso zzso to construct zzso using the hybrid zzso zzso The hybrid zzso zzso triggered the specific zzso of relevant target cells by resting zzso cells and by a subset of zzso zzso In addition, some zzso zzso clones but not zzso zzso clones could be targeted by the zzso
