The zzso caused by surgical stress in cancer therapy may affect the prognosis of patients by enhancing the residual zzso An investigation of changes of zzso zzso and zzso cell activity during the zzso course was performed for the analysis of the zzso caused by the surgical stress in patients with gastrointestinal zzso In patients undergoing the surgical stress of total zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells significantly depressed on day 1 after operation and remained until day zzso In these patients, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells significantly increased from just after the operation, remained to increase until day 1 after operation and recovered to the zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso cell activity peaked on day 4 and decreased zzso However, in patients with benign disease, decreases of helper and zzso T cells were found to a slight zzso The population of zzso with surface receptors for a soluble zzso factor significantly increased on day 1 after operation in patients receiving zzso zzso and continued to increase until day zzso In patients with zzso treatment of zzso and zzso the decreases in helper and zzso T cells and the increase in zzso zzso T cells were significantly blocked during the zzso zzso Thus, these results indicate that extensive surgical stress such as total zzso and zzso zzso may be attributable to the zzso produced by the induction of zzso cells, and the necessity of zzso and zzso operative zzso may be indicated for a better zzso
