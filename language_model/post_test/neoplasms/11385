To review the use of magnetic resonance zzso zzso as a clinical tool in the identification of cerebral zzso type and grade, as well as zzso in the zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso Also, to review how clinicians are using MRS for surgical planning and zzso evaluation of tumors after zzso 

Studies and clinical case reports published within the previous 10 years, targeting publications in zzso and zzso journals within the previous 3 zzso Sources identified via zzso and zzso zzso 

Studies that contrasted MRS with conventional diagnostic and zzso methods were considered to yield the most relevant data for this zzso Studies discussing cancer staging and grading were also examined to help determine clinical significance of zzso 

A review of the literature reveals that, although MRS has mainly been used in zzso and tumor evaluation for brain cancer, it is becoming an increasingly important adjunct to conventional diagnostic and monitoring procedures for cancer of the zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso 

The clinical usefulness of MRS has yet to be fully zzso As MRS availability and access increases, appropriate evaluations of its strengths and weaknesses will be zzso The authors conclude that research to date and primary observation indicate that MRS is a promising clinical tool for zzso management of zzso
