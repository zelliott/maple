Continuous zzso monitoring of human zzso and a tumor cell line was achieved by means of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso applied to cells suspended in zzso zzso Human peripheral blood zzso cultured in zzso were examined with zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso before and after zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Following the addition of these biological response zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These appear to be markers of zzso zzso zzso pH was zzso A target tumor cell line zzso showed zzso zzso zzso that differed significantly from that of zzso When zzso were mixed with tumor cells (to induce tumor cell zzso and monitored by zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso increased, zzso levels fell, and release of zzso was zzso zzso MRS may therefore provide a zzso zzso of zzso tumor cell killing that will have application in monitoring treatment in patients undergoing this type of zzso
