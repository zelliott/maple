To evaluate zzso function before and after zzso inferior zzso zzso zzso filter zzso 

We describe, in a personal series of 13 consecutive cases (all of them stage IV cancer patients, one zzso zzso one zzso zzso 11 Greenfield zzso in our institution, two cases of fatal zzso vein zzso after placement of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso function was based on serum zzso (in zzso normal zzso serum zzso (in zzso normal zzso and calculation of serum zzso zzso 

This study suggests that in zzso cancer patients who have a single functional zzso zzso functional zzso or previous zzso vein zzso zzso filter placement above the zzso veins may not be zzso zzso filter placement should be performed only after analysis of predicted survival, after detailed discussions with the patient, and most zzso after zzso function zzso
