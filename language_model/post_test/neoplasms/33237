The evaluation of research zzso such as zzso of the proportion of treatment successes, is of ethical, scientific, and public importance but has rarely been evaluated zzso We assessed how often experimental cancer treatments that undergo testing in zzso clinical trials zzso result in discovery of successful new zzso 

We extracted data from all completed (published and zzso phase 3 zzso conducted by the National Cancer Institute cooperative groups since their inception in zzso zzso successes were determined by zzso assessing the proportion of statistically significant trials favoring new or standard treatments, zzso determining the proportion of the trials in which new treatments were considered superior to standard treatments according to the original researchers, and zzso zzso zzso data for main clinical outcomes zzso and zzso zzso 

Data from 624 trials zzso zzso zzso involving 216 zzso patients were zzso In all, zzso of trials had statistically significant results, of which new interventions were superior to established treatments in zzso of zzso The original researchers judged that the zzso profile favored new treatments in zzso of comparisons zzso of zzso zzso ratios for overall and zzso survival, available for zzso zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, slightly favoring new zzso zzso interventions were discovered in zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso to 50% of new cancer treatments that reach the stage of assessment in zzso will prove zzso The pattern of successes has become more stable over zzso The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ethical principle of zzso defines limits of zzso in clinical research and ultimately drives therapeutic advances in clinical zzso
