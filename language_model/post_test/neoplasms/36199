The scientific process around cancer research begins with scientific discovery, followed by development of interventions, and finally delivery of needed interventions to people with zzso Numerous studies have identified substantial gaps between discovery and delivery in health zzso Team science has been identified as a possible solution for closing the discovery to delivery zzso however, little is known about effective ways of collaborating within teams and across zzso The purpose of this study was to determine benefits and drawbacks associated with organizational collaboration across the zzso research zzso 

Representatives of organizations working on cancer research across a state answered a survey about how they collaborated with other cancer research organizations in the state and what benefits and drawbacks they experienced while zzso We used exponential random graph modeling to determine the association between these benefits and drawbacks and the presence of a collaboration tie between any two network zzso 

Different drawbacks and benefits were associated with discovery, development, and delivery zzso The only consistent association across all three was with the drawback of difficulty due to geographic differences, which was zzso associated with collaboration, indicating that those organizations that had collaborated were less likely to perceive a barrier related to zzso The benefit, enhanced access to other knowledge, was positive and significant in the development and delivery networks, indicating that collaborating organizations viewed improved knowledge exchange as a benefit of zzso zzso of additional funding or other zzso and zzso of new tools and zzso were zzso significantly related to collaboration in these zzso So, although improved knowledge access was an outcome of collaboration, more tangible outcomes were not being zzso In the development network, those who collaborated were less likely to see zzso influence on treatment and zzso and zzso quality or frequency of zzso as benefits of zzso 

With the exception of the positive association between knowledge transfer and collaboration and the negative association between geography and collaboration, the significant relationships identified in this study all reflected challenges associated with zzso zzso zzso network structures and the perceived drawbacks and benefits associated with collaboration will allow researchers to build and zzso to support successful collaborative teams and perhaps aid in closing the discovery to delivery zzso
