We examined the effects of X-ray zzso on zzso zzso oxide zzso production in bovine zzso zzso cells zzso Single zzso of up to 60 zzso did not affect the expression of zzso NO zzso zzso zzso as assessed by reverse zzso in zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso concentration and zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso were also not affected by single zzso However, zzso zzso constitutional NO production could not be examined directly because zzso zzso showed continuous NO production, as measured by zzso fluorescence, without zzso zzso zzso of zzso NO zzso zzso zzso and protein was markedly increased by 2 zzso of zzso thereby indicating that the zzso and continuous NO production in zzso zzso was due to the expression of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso showed zzso in the presence of zzso and the zzso was prevented by zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that single zzso does not affect zzso zzso and zzso expression but zzso the expression of zzso in zzso and the latter property would be beneficial to induce zzso in the adjacent tumor zzso
