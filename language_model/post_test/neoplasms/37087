zzso zzso results from multiple zzso zzso zzso in tumor vessel structure and function lead to decreased oxygen delivery relative to normal zzso Furthermore, a relatively high rate of tumor cell proliferation increases oxygen consumption by tumor zzso The net result of decreased oxygen supply and increased oxygen demand is zzso zzso makes tumors resistant to radiation and some chemotherapy, and it zzso expression of growth factors, zzso factors, and cell cycle regulatory proteins that affect tumor zzso Recent attempts to make tumors more sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy by reducing zzso (by increasing tumor blood flow, the use of zzso zzso and blood zzso have been zzso Future research may be directed more toward decreasing oxygen consumption or actually exploiting the hypoxic environment to achieve a therapeutic zzso
