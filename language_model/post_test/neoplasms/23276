Recently, more and more attention has been drawn on the long-term effects of insulin zzso Here we strived to estimate the association of cancer occurrence with the use of insulin zzso 

We searched all the publications regarding the association between cancer occurrence and the use of insulin zzso using the US National Library of Medicine's zzso zzso Data were independently extracted and analyzed using random or fixed effects zzso depending upon the degree of zzso 

Seven cohort studies were included in the zzso Cancer occurrence had no significant difference in zzso patients compared to patients treated with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In our zzso analysis, zzso compared to other zzso did not increase the risk of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gastrointestinal cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso of zzso studies does not support an increased cancer risk in patients treated with insulin zzso The result provides confidence for the development of insulin zzso but needs confirmation by further clinical zzso
