zzso of zzso zzso rate zzso using the clearance of zzso 51 zzso zzso (or other zzso zzso is reliable, but invasive and not always zzso zzso models have been devised for zzso zzso using readily zzso patient zzso Unfortunately, these models were developed using various patient populations and may not provide the optimal prediction of zzso in children with zzso The current study uses population zzso to determine the relationship between zzso zzso and patient zzso in 50 zzso cancer zzso These models were validated using a separate group of 43 children and were compared with previously published models of zzso zzso Body size was the major zzso of zzso clearance and inclusion of weight or surface area reduced the residual zzso between individuals zzso of zzso from 61 to zzso zzso zzso was the only other zzso that significantly improved the zzso Mean percentage error values of zzso and zzso were observed for models including weight alone or weight and zzso respectively, with precision estimates of zzso and zzso These simple additive models provide a more rationale approach than the use of complex zzso involving additional zzso to predict zzso zzso
