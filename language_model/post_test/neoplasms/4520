To describe the zzso and types of first zzso zzso infection zzso in cancer patients and to identify indicators for zzso zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

A zzso zzso referral cancer center and its supportive care university teaching zzso 

A retrospective review was conducted of zzso consecutive adult zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso placement from 1986 to 1990 at a regional zzso zzso zzso was determined on the basis of clinical information zzso the zzso zzso as the source of zzso Patient characteristics and data about zzso zzso site zzso tunnel infection with zzso exit site zzso zzso infection, and exit site zzso with zzso zzso were zzso from patient medical zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses for the risk of zzso and zzso removal were zzso 

The zzso of first zzso was zzso infections per 1,000 zzso zzso Overall, 156 zzso of zzso patients developed their first zzso prior to zzso zzso The median time to zzso was 90 zzso Male gender zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso emerged as significant risk factors for zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso model verified that male gender zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with an enhanced risk of zzso There were 35 exit site infections zzso three infections of the tunnel and the exit site zzso 80 zzso infections zzso and another 38 zzso infections with zzso exist site infections zzso The zzso of zzso infection was zzso per 1,000 zzso zzso zzso pathogens outnumbered zzso and zzso with zzso zzso being most zzso Fifty zzso of 156 zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso removal in the zzso analysis were zzso infection zzso zzso zzso and pathogen type zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso analysis suggested that having a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso pathogen was the most important factor for zzso zzso 

These data suggest that first zzso occur more commonly in male patients with zzso zzso than in patients with solid zzso The removal of zzso zzso in zzso patients probably is predicated on the zzso zzso but further investigations are necessary to delineate this zzso
