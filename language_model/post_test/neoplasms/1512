Human tumors are believed to harbor a disabled zzso tumor zzso pathway, either through direct zzso of the zzso gene or through zzso expression of proteins acting in the zzso pathway, such as zzso or zzso A role for zzso (or zzso as a key negative regulator of zzso function in zzso has been zzso However, a direct contribution of zzso to tumor formation remains to be zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso allows primary mouse embryonic zzso zzso and leads to zzso transformation in combination with zzso Furthermore, the human zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso in a significant percentage of various human tumors and amplified in zzso of primary breast tumors, all of which retained zzso zzso zzso was also amplified and highly expressed in zzso a breast cancer cell line harboring zzso zzso and interfering zzso reduction of zzso markedly inhibited the growth potential of these cells in a zzso zzso Together, these results make zzso a new putative drug target for cancer zzso
