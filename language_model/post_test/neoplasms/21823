zzso stem cell zzso therapy can significantly lower instances of infection in chemotherapy patients by accelerating the recovery of white blood cells in the zzso However, therapy requires that zzso be stored at zzso temperatures to retain the zzso ability to zzso Currently, cells are stored in zzso blood bags that are subject to fracture at the extremely low storage temperatures, which leads to cell contamination, thereby reducing their zzso zzso we have developed an zzso model to predict the zzso of stresses that ultimately lead to crack initiation and bag fracture during zzso zzso Our model gives explicit relationships between stress state in the container and zzso properties of the container material, container zzso and environmental factors that include temperature of the system and pressure induced by excess gas evolving from the stored zzso zzso based on the model are consistent with experimental observations of bag failures that occurred during zzso storage zzso Finally, the model can provide guidance in material selection and bag design to zzso bags that will be less susceptible to zzso
