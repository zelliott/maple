The zzso countries have a long tradition of large-scale zzso and comprehensive, zzso health data zzso zzso on unique personal zzso enabling follow-up studies spanning many zzso Joint zzso zzso studies provide unique opportunities for zzso molecular zzso zzso The zzso Biological zzso Banks working group on Cancer zzso and Control zzso has worked out very precise quality assurance principles for handling of the samples, based on the tradition in zzso zzso The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how high standards of quality assurance can also be developed for the data related to the subjects and samples in the zzso Some of the practices adopted from the strong zzso cohort study experience evidently improve quality of zzso zzso studies zzso in zzso zzso The data quality requirements for the zzso zzso ratio calculation offer a good way to check and improve accuracy of person identifiers and zzso of follow-up for vital status, which are crucial in zzso studies for picking up right controls for the zzso The zzso zzso design applying zzso sampling is recommended as an optimal design for most zzso zzso It is demonstrated how some types of zzso have a period immediately after zzso when the cancer risk is not comparable with the cancer risk in the base population, and how many of the zzso never represent the normal average population of the zzso The estimates on the zzso of the zzso assist in interpretation of zzso of results of the studies based on these samples, and the systematic zzso of numbers of cancer cases will serve in study power zzso The well over zzso prospective cancer cases registered among subjects in the zzso zzso zzso have already offered unique possibilities for tens of strong studies, but for rare zzso combinations predictions on future numbers of cases improve the chance to select the right moment when the study will have accurate statistical zzso
