Studies investigating the association between zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 1 zzso and cancer risk report conflicting zzso To derive a more precise zzso of the relationship between zzso zzso and cancer risk, the present zzso was carried zzso 

A comprehensive search was conducted to determine all the eligible studies about zzso zzso and cancer zzso Combined odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were used to assess the strength of the association between the zzso zzso and cancer zzso We investigated by zzso the effects of 2 zzso in zzso zzso (17 studies, zzso cases, zzso zzso and zzso (20 studies, zzso cases, zzso zzso The overall results indicated no major influence of these 2 zzso on cancer zzso For zzso a decreased cancer risk was found in acute zzso leukemia zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso the data showed that zzso zzso zzso was associated with a decreased colon cancer risk under dominant model zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso might be associated with a decreased risk of ALL and other zzso Meanwhile, the zzso zzso might play a protective role in the development of colon zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies are necessary to validate the risk identified in the present zzso
