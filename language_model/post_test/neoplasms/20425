The zzso at zzso 72 of the zzso gene has been extensively studied for its involvement in zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso Usually, the zzso 4 of the zzso gene is amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso on DNA extracted from blood and tumor zzso then zzso by zzso In the case of zzso the comparison of zzso profile from blood and tumor DNA zzso products allowed the identification of a potential zzso in the zzso zzso This method can be hindered by a partial zzso zzso and/or DNA contamination of zzso zzso To circumvent these problems, we have developed a new approach by using the zzso restriction site between zzso 4 and zzso zzso The zzso amplification of zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso allowed us to detect without ambiguity any zzso zzso
