The clinical success of selective zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso as therapeutic agents for several human zzso has prompted substantial interest in the further development and clinical testing of such zzso for a wide variety of zzso While much of this effort has been focused on the zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso are also beginning to emerge within discovery zzso Among these zzso the zzso and zzso zzso have received substantial attention, zzso largely to the relatively high frequency of zzso zzso of zzso ( approximately zzso of all human zzso an upstream zzso of the well established zzso signaling zzso as well as frequent zzso zzso in the zzso zzso ( approximately zzso of all human zzso Here, we zzso the current state of development of zzso zzso directed at this signaling pathway, a few of which have already demonstrating favorable toxicity profiles as well as promising activity in early phase clinical zzso
