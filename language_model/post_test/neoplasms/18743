It is well known that tumor formation arises from the imbalance between cell death and zzso For many years, cancer research has engaged an important part of its efforts to find new therapeutic strategies based on cell death zzso One of the zzso ways to kill tumor cells is to trigger zzso by zzso However tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy is dependent on different biological factors including cancer types, zzso and zzso Although molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso are diverse and depend on zzso and drugs used, a common zzso leading to tumor cell death has been shown to zzso the generation of a simple cellular zzso zzso zzso is released by the activity of neutral or zzso zzso or de zzso synthesis during treatment with zzso This review in particular focuses on zzso involved in zzso cell death such as neutral or zzso zzso and zzso zzso the role of zzso in cellular effects of chemotherapy at the plasma membrane or the zzso and the induction of cell death by zzso It also includes recent advances on novel patented zzso compounds and cancer therapeutic strategies based on zzso zzso
