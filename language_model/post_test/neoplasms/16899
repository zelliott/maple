The aims of the study were zzso to test for uniformity of distribution of childhood zzso and other zzso and zzso to consider the zzso implications of unusual zzso 

A test for zzso zzso was applied using a method which allows for unequal distribution of the population at risk and avoids using census data to provide population zzso When zzso was identified, four possible zzso links which had already been suggested to the zzso Research Fund Centre were examined in a local zzso 

The study was carried out in the zzso Health Region in the north of zzso 

144 children under 15 years of age with a diagnosis of zzso disease known to the zzso Regional Childhood zzso zzso between 1974 and 1986 were included in the zzso Of these 53 had zzso and nine had zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was found in North zzso though not in the whole of the zzso Health zzso A number of clustered cases were identified, some of whom were in a post code sector, zzso 10, to the west of zzso about which concern had been expressed since zzso There was however no evidence that disease zzso was confined to this zzso Four previously suggested hypotheses about causation in this particular area were examined but the results were negative or zzso 

The identification of zzso zzso must be seen as only the first step in a series of zzso it can only rarely lead to zzso conclusions by itself, but it can motivate and target other zzso
