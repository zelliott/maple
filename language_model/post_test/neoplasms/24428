Conventional genetic theories have failed to explain why cancer zzso is not found in newborns and thus not zzso zzso develops only years to decades after zzso by zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso carries zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso resistance, zzso or affinity for non-native sites and zzso that is not necessary for zzso zzso contains no zzso zzso We propose instead that cancer is a zzso disease: zzso zzso initiate zzso evolutions via unspecific zzso By zzso thousands of genes zzso zzso teams of proteins that zzso zzso and repair zzso zzso is thus a steady source of zzso variations from which, in classical zzso terms, selection of zzso zzso encourages the evolution and subsequent zzso zzso of cancer zzso The rates of these variations are zzso to the degrees of zzso and can exceed conventional zzso by zzso orders of zzso This makes cancer cells new cell zzso with zzso but unstable zzso rather than zzso zzso The zzso zzso generate complex, zzso zzso through the abnormal zzso of the thousands of zzso just as zzso 21 generates Down zzso Thus cancer is a zzso rather than a genetic zzso The zzso theory explains zzso zzso of cancer, because zzso is not zzso zzso long zzso zzso by the low probability of evolving competitive new zzso zzso zzso zzso via genes zzso on selective zzso and zzso zzso because zzso variations neutralize negative zzso and adapt to zzso conditions much faster than conventional zzso Based on this article a similar one, entitled 'The zzso basis of zzso has since been published by us in Cellular Oncology zzso
