Both zzso and vascular development require guidance to establish a precise branching pattern of these systems in the zzso zzso Several molecules implicated in zzso navigation have also been shown to regulate vessel zzso Among these guidance cues, zzso constitute a family of zzso molecules with a zzso role in zzso zzso Recent findings zzso zzso in other zzso zzso including vascular zzso We here review recent studies and discuss the possible dual function of zzso and its receptors during branching of blood vessels in zzso and pathological zzso
