The objective of this study was to assess differences in the zzso values of zzso zzso zzso among different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A phantom study was performed to compare standardized zzso value zzso in five PET scanners including a dedicated PET scanner and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso simulating the zzso of zzso was filled in the hot spheres (8 zzso 11 zzso 14 zzso 18 zzso 22 zzso and 27 zzso that were set in the zzso phantom with the background zzso of zzso Data acquisition and reconstruction were performed according to routine and standardized zzso The standardized condition was as zzso CT acquisition zzso zzso 50 zzso and PET acquisition zzso acquisition with a slice thickness of 2 zzso reconstruction was performed by ordered zzso expectation zzso + zzso zzso zzso of hot spheres and zzso was compared between routine condition and standardized condition with five PET zzso 

On routine condition, two cameras could detect a zzso sphere zzso On the other hand, the zzso of hot spheres by the standardized condition was remarkably zzso zzso evaluation revealed that a maximum of zzso error was recognized with the zzso sphere by the routine condition, although the standardized condition could reduce the error to zzso 

zzso depends not only on the PET machine but also on the imaging zzso The results indicate that zzso is variable with PET machines under routine conditions of data acquisition and zzso zzso of the zzso can reduce zzso and maximum difference in the zzso by zzso
