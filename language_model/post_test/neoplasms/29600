The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso administered in 4 week cycles in patients with advanced solid zzso 

Patients were treated with intravenous zzso on day 1 and T on days 1, 8, and zzso Once the zzso was reached the schedule of zzso was changed to days 1 and 15 to explore an alternative and potentially more manageable dosing zzso
