Laboratory research and zzso are providing zzso evidence that the widely used zzso drug zzso has zzso activity, but there are zzso Although population studies suggest that zzso exposure is associated with reduced cancer risk and/or improved zzso these data are mostly retrospective and zzso Laboratory models show zzso activity, but zzso zzso used in many experiments exceed those achieved with conventional doses used for diabetes zzso zzso zzso research should be useful in guiding design of clinical trials, not only to evaluate zzso at conventional zzso doses, where reduction of elevated insulin levels may contribute to zzso activity for certain zzso of patients, but also to explore more aggressive dosing of zzso which may lead to zzso of energy metabolism in a manner that could provide important opportunities for synthetic zzso through rational drug combinations or in the context of genetic zzso associated with hypersensitivity to energetic zzso 

There are tantalizing clues that justify the investigation of zzso activities of zzso The complexity of their zzso effects requires further zzso research to guide clinical trial zzso
