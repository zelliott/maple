Several in zzso studies and limited in zzso investigations showed that some zzso fatty acids zzso such as zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso acid have selective zzso zzso This zzso action of zzso is produced by zzso of zzso generation and zzso zzso in tumor cells but not in normal zzso Moreover, zzso such as zzso and tumor necrosis factor seem to produce their zzso effects by inducing the release of zzso from the zzso zzso pool and zzso generation, and several zzso drugs, especially zzso and zzso have the capacity to augment zzso generation and promote zzso zzso zzso cells are known to contain low amounts of zzso have decreased capacity to generate free zzso and zzso zzso and are highly susceptible to free zzso zzso compared with normal zzso In addition, zzso and their products can zzso the immune response, augment the respiratory burst of zzso and zzso generation by zzso and modify genetic damage induced by zzso and zzso These zzso coupled with the observation that the cancer zzso is low in zzso on traditionally zzso zzso suggests that zzso can be exploited as possible zzso agents either alone or in combination with zzso and cancer zzso
