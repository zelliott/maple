A zzso predominantly black, zzso population in Alabama is targeted for a program aimed at improving access to state-of-the-art cancer zzso This paper presents combined zzso cancer zzso rates for predominantly black, rural counties in North Carolina and Georgia similar to the Alabama counties and compares these rates with zzso zzso and End zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Cancer zzso data from 1990 to 1993 were obtained from the Georgia Center for Cancer Statistics for 10 rural counties with predominantly black zzso Likewise, cancer zzso data from 1990 to 1993 were obtained for seven zzso counties in North Carolina from the North Carolina Central Cancer zzso zzso zzso rates from 1990 to 1992 were obtained for nine zzso zzso 

The overall cancer zzso rate from North Carolina and Georgia is lower by zzso than the zzso zzso Cancer zzso rates for zzso of the breast, zzso zzso and prostate were at least zzso lower than the zzso rates, while the invasive cervical cancer rate was zzso times higher than the zzso zzso 

zzso comprise about 50% of the population in these zzso In contrast, the zzso population is predominantly white, and the black population is primarily zzso Estimates of the number of cancer cases in black, zzso populations based on zzso zzso rates is not reflective of the cancer experience in these zzso
