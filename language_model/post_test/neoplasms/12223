Human zzso zzso zzso a class zzso major zzso complex zzso is potentially relevant in the immune response through its various immune cell zzso Its expression noticed in some zzso has also been shown on zzso and zzso cells zzso in zzso and inflammatory zzso As DC constitute a key component in the immune response, this work aimed at assessing the expression of zzso at zzso and zzso levels during differentiation and maturation of the different DC zzso We show that zzso zzso was induced during zzso DC differentiation and is associated with a zzso expression in half of cases and with a substantial zzso of soluble zzso in all zzso zzso were very similar for zzso DC, but there was still a weak zzso zzso expression and a lower level of zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso was weak in zzso DC without any zzso zzso expression and with a zzso level of zzso The mechanisms involved in zzso expression appear zzso and zzso However, the amount of zzso transcripts and the expression of the protein are not zzso zzso expression or zzso by DC may have negative consequences on the function of effective immune cells and also on DC themselves via the interaction with zzso receptors expressed by these zzso The capacity of DC to express or zzso zzso should be studied in the context of cellular therapy using DC in addition to its zzso action in immune zzso
