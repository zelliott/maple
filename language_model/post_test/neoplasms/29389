One of the most important adverse effects of zzso is zzso A zzso decision on the use of zzso in the treatment of childhood zzso should be based on evidence regarding both zzso efficacy and zzso 

To compare zzso efficacy of treatment including or not including zzso in children with childhood zzso 

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, zzso zzso zzso zzso to March zzso and zzso zzso to March zzso In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trials zzso 

zzso controlled trials zzso comparing treatment of any type of childhood cancer with and without zzso and reporting outcomes concerning zzso zzso 

Two zzso independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data zzso 

We identified zzso for six types of zzso acute zzso zzso zzso (three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (one zzso 413 zzso Ewing's zzso (one zzso 94 zzso zzso zzso (one zzso zzso zzso and zzso (one zzso 255 zzso All studies had zzso zzso For ALL no evidence of a significant difference in zzso efficacy was identified in the zzso but in most individual studies there was a suggestion of better zzso efficacy in patients treated with zzso For both zzso zzso and Ewing's zzso a significant difference in zzso and overall survival in zzso of treatment with zzso was identified, although for zzso zzso the significant difference in overall survival disappears with long-term zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso no difference in zzso efficacy between the treatment groups was zzso Clinical zzso was evaluated in three zzso no significant difference between both treatment groups was identified, but in all individual studies there was a suggestion of a lower rate of clinical zzso in patients who did not receive zzso None of the studies evaluated zzso cardiac zzso For other childhood zzso no zzso were zzso 

At the moment no evidence from zzso is available which underscores the use of zzso in zzso However, zzso evidence of zzso as identified in this review, is not the same as zzso of no zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso Ewing's zzso zzso zzso and zzso only one zzso was available and, therefore, no definitive conclusions can be made about the zzso efficacy of treatment with or without zzso in these zzso For other childhood zzso no zzso were identified and therefore, no conclusions can be made about the zzso efficacy of treatment with or without zzso in these zzso
