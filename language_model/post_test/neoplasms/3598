We reviewed the mechanism of zzso DNA damage with reference to metal zzso and zzso chemical zzso On the basis of the finding that zzso zzso induced zzso DNA damage in the presence of hydrogen zzso zzso we proposed the hypothesis that zzso zzso oxygen species play a role in metal zzso Since then, we have reported that various metal compounds, such as zzso nickel, and zzso zzso directly cause zzso DNA damage in the presence of zzso We also found that zzso metals could cause DNA damage through indirect zzso Certain zzso compounds induced zzso DNA damage in rat lungs through zzso zzso metals, copper and iron, zzso zzso generation from various organic zzso resulting in zzso DNA zzso zzso compounds, such as zzso and zzso zzso appear to induce cancer mainly through DNA zzso formation, although their zzso and zzso zzso can also cause zzso DNA zzso On the other hand, zzso compounds, such as zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso should express their zzso through zzso DNA zzso zzso of certain zzso efficiently caused zzso DNA damage by forming zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso DNA damage plays important roles in chemical zzso
