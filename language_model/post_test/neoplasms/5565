Lung Cancer Associated zzso zzso is a high molecular weight zzso defined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared against a primary zzso of the zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso at elevated levels in patients with lung zzso However, a suitable zzso for monitoring zzso levels has not been zzso The present work describes the development of a zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso as the capture zzso and zzso zzso as the zzso In 60 normal subjects, the mean zzso level was zzso zzso with 2 zzso subjects having values zzso 12 zzso zzso + zzso By contrast, 37 of 67 zzso patients with lung cancer had zzso levels zzso 12 zzso Moreover, only 14 of zzso zzso patients with benign lung disease had elevated zzso zzso levels were most commonly elevated zzso in patients with zzso of the lung and with advanced zzso These results indicate that zzso as detected by zzso zzso is a potentially useful marker for the evaluation of patients with lung zzso
