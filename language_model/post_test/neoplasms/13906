This paper reviews approximate confidence intervals for some effect parameters common in cancer zzso These methods have zzso feasibility and give nearly nominal coverage zzso In the analysis of crude data, the simplest type of zzso analysis, parameters of interest are the odds ratio in zzso studies and the rate ratio and difference in cohort zzso These parameters can estimate the zzso ratio and difference that are the most meaningful effect measures in cancer zzso Approximate confidence intervals for these parameters including the classical zzso method are mainly based on efficient zzso When some zzso factors exist, zzso analysis and summary measures for effect parameters are zzso Since the zzso zzso have been widely used by epidemiologists as summary measures, confidence intervals based on the zzso zzso are zzso The paper also discusses recent developments in these zzso
