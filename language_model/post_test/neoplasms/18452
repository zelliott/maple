PET is a crucial technique in molecular imaging, allowing in zzso assessment and zzso of pathological zzso thanks to its ability to detect very small amounts of radioactive zzso This is of particular interest in zzso where abnormal metabolism or synthesis in tumor cells but also various tumor characteristics can be studied using this nuclear medicine zzso zzso is currently the most widely used zzso nowadays essential in the management of various zzso with large applications in diagnosis, initial assessment, therapy monitoring, and recurrence zzso The combination of anatomical information provided by zzso further increased its zzso Beyond its spread use in daily practice, future applications of PET will involve other zzso than zzso and develop research applications in humans as well as in small zzso
