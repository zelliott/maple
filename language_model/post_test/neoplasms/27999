The purpose of this study was to assess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso varies with age in Ontario cancer zzso zzso zzso differences in the use of zzso (if they zzso vary with cancer site and treatment zzso zzso the zzso variation in zzso zzso is comparable to the decline in functional status in the general population; and zzso the variation with age is due to differences in referral to a cancer center or to subsequent zzso

The rate of zzso use declined with age, particularly for zzso and zzso zzso The relative decline in zzso with age exceeded the relative decline in functional status with age in the general zzso Most of the decline in zzso use was related to a decline in referral to cancer zzso 

The referral for, and use of, zzso and zzso zzso decreases more with age than can be explained by zzso decline in functional status observed in the general zzso
