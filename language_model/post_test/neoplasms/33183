Small size at birth is associated with subsequent cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and large size is associated with obesity and zzso The overall impact of these opposing effects on mortality throughout the lifespan is unclear because causes of death change with zzso 

We investigated the association of birth weight with adult zzso mortality using a Danish zzso cohort of zzso men and women born from 1936 through zzso The cohort was linked to vital statistic zzso The main outcome was zzso mortality from ages 25 through 68 zzso zzso with death from cancer, circulatory disease, and all other causes were also zzso 

During zzso zzso of zzso zzso deaths occurred among men and zzso among zzso The cumulative hazard ratios of the association between birth weight categories and zzso mortality was constant for all ages investigated and did not differ between men and zzso Compared with subjects having birth weights in the reference category zzso zzso those with the lowest birth weights zzso zzso had zzso higher mortality zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and those with the highest birth weights zzso zzso had zzso higher mortality zzso from all zzso The association of birth weight with cancer increased linearly, whereas the association of birth weight with circulatory disease and all other causes was zzso 

To the degree that the association of birth weight with adult survival is zzso the zzso association between birth weight and adult mortality suggests that population increases in birth weight may not necessarily lead to improved health in zzso
