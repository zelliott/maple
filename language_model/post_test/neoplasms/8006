Having the ability to alter the genetic makeup of a cancer cell by gene transfer is a potentially powerful strategy for treating human zzso However, a low efficiency of gene delivery in zzso and poor zzso specificity has prevented the widespread zzso of this technology in the zzso Despite these formidable obstacles, the first successful application of gene therapy in the treatment of cancer may occur when it is combined with local zzso such as radiation zzso A small number of gene therapy strategies have been evaluated in clinical trials in combination with external beam radiation zzso The combined therapy has been zzso and has not exacerbated the side effects of radiation zzso Gene transfer and zzso cell destruction has been demonstrated in zzso Although the results await confirmation in larger, prospective Phase III trials, there is suggestive evidence that the combined therapies may be demonstrating better than expected zzso zzso Our vast knowledge of the molecular defects that drive the cancer process, coupled with our expanding understanding of the genes responsible for zzso cell zzso have spawned the development of rational, targeted gene therapies designed to increase zzso cell zzso Here, the results of the clinical trials conducted so far will be zzso followed by a description of new approaches under development at zzso
