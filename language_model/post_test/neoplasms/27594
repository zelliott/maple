Over the last decade, drug discovery efforts have generated a myriad of compounds that inhibit the activity of the zzso family of zzso zzso with zzso and selectivity that have surpassed original zzso These zzso along with improved pharmaceutical properties, have enabled zzso from this class of agents to finally realize their therapeutic potential, and indeed, some are currently producing significant clinical zzso Interestingly, those properties that are essential for a clinically active inhibitor of the zzso family are most readily attained with compounds that bind at the zzso site, and the most successful compounds have shown a distinct convergence to certain common chemical zzso The reasons for this trend are beginning to be realized through the generation of an increasing array of zzso structures for protein zzso as well as advances in molecular zzso This has allowed a more complete understanding of the precise physical interactions that occur between zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso which, in turn, has begun to shed light on the mechanism by which these molecules attain their remarkable affinity and zzso
