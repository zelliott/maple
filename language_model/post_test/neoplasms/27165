zzso treatment response studies typically measure the change in the standardized zzso value zzso to zzso zzso The relative changes of different zzso measures, such as zzso peak, mean, or total zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso respectively), are used across the literature to zzso patients into response categories, with quantitative thresholds separating the different zzso We investigated the impact of different zzso measures on the zzso and zzso of zzso treatment zzso 

Sixteen patients with solid zzso were treated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in a variety of zzso Using the cellular proliferation marker zzso zzso we acquired zzso zzso scans at zzso during treatment, and after zzso The highest zzso zzso zzso zzso were segmented on PET zzso zzso PET response was assessed via the relative change in zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby yielding 4 different responses for each tumor at zzso and zzso For each zzso measure, a population average PET response was determined over all zzso Standard zzso zzso and range were used to zzso variation of PET response within individual tumors and population zzso 

Different zzso measures resulted in substantial variation of individual tumor PET response assessments zzso zzso zzso average range, zzso The most extreme variation between 4 PET response measures was zzso in individual zzso zzso of tumor PET response depended strongly on the zzso measure, because different zzso measures resulted in conflicting zzso of PET response zzso treatment response assessment) in more than zzso of zzso Variation of the population average PET response was considerably smaller zzso zzso zzso average range, zzso and this variation was not statistically zzso zzso in tumor PET response were greatest between zzso and zzso and smallest between zzso and zzso Variations of tumor PET response at zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso and zzso of zzso treatment response in individual patients were strongly affected by the zzso measure used to assess zzso This substantial uncertainty in individual patient PET response was present despite the concurrent zzso of the population average PET zzso Given the ambiguity of individual patient PET responses, selection of zzso treatment response measures and their associated thresholds should be carefully zzso
