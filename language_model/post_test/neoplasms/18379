Cancer pain is identified as a zzso experience, but relatively few brief instruments are available for assessing the complex zzso experiences of terminal cancer patients in zzso The purposes of this study were to zzso translate and examine the feasibility and zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Chinese zzso when used with patients having terminal cancer and zzso apply the zzso to examine zzso zzso experiences of terminal cancer patients in zzso 

The zzso was tested in 106 terminal cancer zzso at a hospice setting in zzso 

The results showed that the zzso has satisfactory face and content zzso zzso acceptable internal consistency reliability zzso zzso alpha of zzso and overall support of theoretical zzso However, instead of the zzso structure of the original zzso we found a zzso structure (with pain intensity and pain interference merged into one zzso that explained zzso of the zzso Close to half the patients zzso had considerable levels of pain zzso and a majority zzso reported not having control in life based on the zzso of zzso zzso 

Our results support the brief zzso as a feasible and valid tool for assessing and representing zzso pain experiences in terminal cancer zzso The zzso could help clinicians and researchers assess the complex zzso pain experiences of terminal cancer patients, including zzso cancer zzso
