To study zzso which is probably the initial step in zzso invasion, we associated tissue culture fragments with living zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, as well as zzso zzso cells, were transplanted into cultured chick zzso and organ fragments from chick zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso by zzso with zzso solution, and by zzso examination after zzso It was shown that the zzso of these tissue culture fragments depends on the nature of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso side of zzso proved to be zzso In contrast, the zzso side of intact zzso was zzso zzso zzso allowed zzso at the site of the zzso In the presence of zzso zzso cells adhere to the zzso side of zzso and to the zzso side of the upper layer of the zzso We concluded that the zzso side of intact zzso constitutes an inappropriate zzso for zzso of a large variety of cells, in zzso as well as in zzso zzso of this characteristic in the presence of zzso indicates that long-range zzso zzso might be responsible for the zzso character of the zzso
