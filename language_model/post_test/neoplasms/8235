In order to progress from the relatively harmless avascular state to the potentially lethal vascular state, solid zzso must induce the growth of new blood vessels from existing ones, a process called zzso The zzso growth zzso around zzso zzso there are several zzso models of this process in the literature and these have reproduced some of the key microscopic features of zzso zzso The most common approach is to simulate the movement of leading zzso cells on a regular zzso Here, we apply a circular random walk model to the process of zzso and thus allow the cells to move independently of a zzso the results display good agreement with empirical zzso We also run simulations of two zzso models in order to make a critical comparison of the different zzso zzso Finally, zzso simulations are carried out in the context of a realistic model of zzso zzso and potential zzso strategies are zzso
