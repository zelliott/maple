Current genetic and zzso theories of zzso drug resistance do not adequately zzso zzso the zzso changes that coincide with resistance, zzso the high rates at which cancer cells acquire and enhance resistance compared to the rates of conventional zzso zzso the wide ranges of resistance such as zzso resistance, zzso the frequent occurrence of intrinsic drug zzso We have recently proposed, that specific zzso zzso are sufficient for drug resistance via new zzso of cooperative zzso independent of gene zzso This mechanism generates new zzso just like zzso 21 generates Down zzso These zzso changes are generated by zzso zzso zzso because zzso zzso the zzso by zzso teams of proteins that zzso repair and segregate zzso Evidence for this zzso mechanism is as zzso zzso resistance is zzso to the number of zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso The high rates at which cancer cells acquire drug resistance are comparable with the rates, as high as zzso per cell generation, at which their zzso zzso hopes for zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance probably reflects zzso zzso of zzso selected for resistance against specific zzso zzso zzso drug resistance probably reflects zzso zzso of zzso selected for zzso We also zzso evidence that resistance of chronic zzso leukemia against the drug zzso is zzso although it is widely believed to be due to zzso of a zzso
