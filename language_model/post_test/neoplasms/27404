zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso that interacts with zzso and zzso zzso and has been implicated in the zzso step of DNA mismatch zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso mismatch repair and assess its importance for zzso and zzso we generated an zzso zzso mouse zzso Analysis of zzso cells for mismatch repair activity in zzso showed that zzso is required for the repair of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and 3' zzso zzso The repair zzso in zzso cells also caused elevated zzso instability at a zzso repeat marker and a significant increase in zzso rate at the zzso zzso zzso animals displayed reduced survival and increased zzso to the development of zzso In addition, zzso male and female mice were sterile because of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso animals proceeded through zzso zzso however, the zzso exhibited dynamic loss of zzso during zzso I, resulting in zzso failure and zzso Our results show that zzso zzso functions in zzso avoidance and is essential for male and female zzso
