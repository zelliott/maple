zzso are abundant on the surfaces of certain zzso tumor cells and have been implicated in the escape of tumors from immune destruction and zzso They are large, highly zzso zzso which are rich in zzso and zzso and have a variety of zzso zzso The zzso zzso or zzso rat zzso zzso zzso cells represents more than zzso of the total cell protein and can be isolated from cell zzso by zzso in 4 M zzso zzso zzso zzso can also be isolated from zzso or cells by zzso zzso extraction as a zzso complex with a second zzso zzso Studies with the fluorescent zzso peanut zzso which binds zzso and zzso A, which binds zzso indicate that the zzso are present at the cell surface as a zzso zzso is shed into cell culture medium or zzso fluid, apparently by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells grown in culture or as solid tumors lose their zzso The zzso reappears with extensive passage of the tumor cells in zzso zzso Studies on the zzso of zzso indicate that zzso is being added over nearly the entire period of transit of zzso from the site of zzso synthesis to the plasma zzso The zzso charged, zzso structure of the zzso suggests that they may play a role in zzso recognition or binding processes necessary for the immune destruction of these tumor zzso
