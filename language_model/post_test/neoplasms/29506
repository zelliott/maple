First established as a valuable zzso model system for studying development, zzso have emerged as an attractive animal system for modeling human zzso Major technical advances have been essential for the generation of zzso cancer models relevant to human zzso These models develop tumors in various organ sites that bear striking resemblance to human zzso both zzso and zzso Thus, the focus of cancer research in zzso has zzso the need to validate zzso as a viable model zzso to study cancer zzso With the significant advantages of in zzso imaging, the power of forward zzso well-established high efficiency for zzso and ease of zzso further exploration of the zzso cancer models not only will generate unique insights into underlying mechanisms of cancer but will also provide platforms useful for drug zzso
