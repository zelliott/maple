A zzso factor for zzso cells can be generated in zzso by zzso human zzso or zzso with zzso or pancreatic zzso zzso and is also zzso in experimental inflammatory zzso The authors therefore sought evidence for the existence of this factor in human zzso Using the zzso chamber zzso they detected zzso activity for zzso human breast zzso cells and Walker zzso tumor cells in human inflammatory and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was not found in zzso normal zzso fluid, or normal zzso Human zzso zzso cells from one of the zzso migrated toward zzso zzso and towards the zzso zzso factor that had been prepared in zzso In gel zzso the zzso factor behaved generally as a zzso having a molecular weight of approximately zzso zzso The activity was blocked after incubation with zzso directed against zzso but not by zzso directed against zzso or zzso In zzso zzso activity for tumor cells could be generated by zzso extracts of zzso cells with zzso plasma or with zzso zzso The authors conclude that a zzso factor for tumor cells can be formed in human zzso and that this factor has properties similar to those of a previously described zzso zzso zzso
