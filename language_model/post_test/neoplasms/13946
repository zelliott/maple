zzso flow zzso DNA analysis as a clinical routine procedure requires adequate and proven guidelines, by which the data can be obtained and interpreted to directly influence management of the individual patient with a specific zzso The present paper is intended as a contribution to such guidelines, of which only fragments are available zzso We have previously described a system of methods, designed for routine flow zzso DNA zzso In the present status report our experience, based on approximately 18,000 samples zzso and zzso is zzso Sample acquisition with zzso zzso storage at zzso degrees C, internal zzso by chicken zzso and trout red blood cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and analysis in the flow zzso is zzso with emphasis on previously unpublished zzso The method of statistical analysis which has an zzso role is described in some zzso A lack of zzso between channel number and DNA content was determined zzso and the zzso of variation zzso was found to decrease with increasing channel zzso The corrections in the zzso of zzso made necessary by these findings are fundamental for zzso the end zzso The zero point adjustment and procedures for changing from one batch of standards to another are zzso A systematic approach to interpretation of DNA zzso is attempted and illustrated by data from clinical specimens of zzso lymphoma, breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, cancer of the oral zzso and zzso zzso Some problems are still zzso and visual inspection is required to determine if the quality of the individual zzso is zzso zzso of the zzso scatter zzso provides additional information for the recognition of zzso The results stress that good quality DNA zzso with as small zzso as possible are important for interpretation of the zzso It is essential that statistical methods are employed to extract the key zzso zzso These are the number of zzso and their relative zzso and for each zzso the DNA index zzso and the zzso of cells in the cell cycle zzso For the DNA data to have any rationally based impact on clinical decision making, it must be demonstrated that they have an independent zzso zzso Strategies for final evaluation are zzso zzso trials on fresh material, to zzso quickly the number of patients necessary for firm conclusions, are zzso
