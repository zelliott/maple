Next generation sequencing approaches applied to the analyses of zzso zzso junction fragments generated in high zzso forward genetic screens has created the need for clear zzso and statistical approaches to deal with the massive amount of data currently being zzso Previous approaches zzso to 1) map junction fragments within the zzso and 2) identify Common zzso Sites zzso within the zzso are not practical due to the volume of data generated by current sequencing zzso Previous approaches applied to this problem also required significant manual zzso 

We describe zzso zzso zzso Distribution Association Network zzso Environment zzso software, which zzso the identification of zzso within zzso junction zzso zzso zzso Starting with zzso sequence data, the software identifies and trims sequences and maps putative zzso sequence to a reference zzso using the bowtie short read zzso zzso distribution statistics are then applied to assess and rank zzso regions showing significant enrichment for zzso zzso Novel methods of counting insertions are used to ensure that the results presented have the expected characteristics of zzso zzso A persistent zzso database is generated and zzso to keep track of zzso zzso and common zzso zzso Additionally, associations between zzso and zzso are also identified using zzso exact test with multiple testing zzso In a case study using previously published data we show that the zzso software identifies zzso as previously zzso zzso them based on zzso allows holistic zzso of the data within zzso browser software and identifies relationships present in the structure of the zzso 

The zzso process is fully zzso performs similarly to previous labor intensive approaches, provides consistent results at a wide range of sequence sampling depth, has the capability of handling extremely large zzso enables meaningful comparison across zzso and enables large scale zzso of junction zzso zzso The zzso software will greatly enhance our ability to analyze these zzso in order to increase our understanding of the genetic basis of zzso
