The authors studied the zzso and delivery of zzso zzso zzso carriers with quantum dots zzso called zzso for zzso imaging and zzso 

zzso zzso carriers consisting of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso Application of the zzso was evaluated by zzso cell migration, cellular zzso in zzso real-time tumor monitoring and drug zzso in zzso 

All zzso exhibited a size of 245 zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso against melanoma cells was superior to that of free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the highest cell zzso and in zzso zzso labeling compared with the other zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso maintained signaling in tumors for at least 24 zzso The zzso zzso in zzso increased by zzso after incorporation into zzso 

For the first time, zzso zzso carriers were coordinated with zzso and an zzso drug to provide efficient tumor imaging and drug zzso Original submitted 1 May zzso zzso submitted 30 August zzso Published online 5 February zzso
