A major barrier to the design of zzso and vaccines for cancer is the idiosyncratic nature of many tumor zzso and the possibility that T cells may be tolerant of broadly distributed zzso We have devised an experimental strategy that exploits species differences in protein sequences to circumvent tolerance of zzso T zzso zzso transgenic mice were used to obtain zzso T zzso specific for peptides from the human zzso zzso zzso presented in association with zzso Although such zzso zzso T cells did not recognize zzso human cells, they were able to lyse a wide variety of human tumor cells lines, thus confirming the existence of broadly distributed zzso that may serve as targets for zzso
