zzso inserted central zzso zzso zzso have been increasingly used in pediatric zzso However, little is known about the zzso and risk of complications when using this device in children with zzso The purposes of this study are to assess the feasibility of zzso and to determine the risk factors for zzso complications in pediatric patients with various types of zzso 

We attempted to place zzso in 53 patients with a median age of 5 years ranging from 2 months to 20 zzso zzso were used to administer fluid, zzso nutrition, zzso agents, zzso and blood products and also for the zzso blood zzso The duration of zzso and the zzso of zzso complications requiring removal were zzso evaluated in association with the diagnosis, sex, age and body weight of the patients, size, zzso site and tip location of the zzso type of treatment, and duration of zzso 

zzso were successfully placed in 109 of 112 attempts zzso in 53 patients, and they were followed for a total of zzso zzso days zzso placement, 87 zzso range, 3 to 512 zzso Fifty five zzso zzso were removed as a result of zzso complications with a rate of zzso per 1,000 zzso zzso The most common reasons for zzso removal were zzso zzso zzso zzso and infection zzso More than zzso of such complications occurred more than 30 days after zzso The zzso tip location in the superior zzso zzso or the right atrium might decrease the risk of zzso Other parameters did not influence the zzso of zzso 

zzso were found to provide a reliable access for prolonged intravenous administration and blood sampling in children zzso treated for zzso and solid zzso thus leading to a reduction of physical pain and psychological stress in such zzso However, the long-term placement of zzso may also be related to an increased risk of zzso
