As the pioneer among molecular zzso techniques, zzso in zzso zzso zzso allows identification of specific sequences in a structurally preserved cell, in zzso or zzso This technique, based on the complementary zzso nature of DNA, zzso labeled specific DNA zzso The probe, bound to the target, will be developed into a fluorescent zzso The fact that the signal can be detected zzso even when fixed in zzso improves the accuracy of the results, since in some cases it is extremely difficult to obtain zzso zzso FISH is still used mostly in research, but there are diagnostic zzso New nomenclature is being developed in order to define many of the aberrations that were not distinguished before zzso zzso diagnosis of zzso and zzso are promptly detected with zzso which is very useful in critical zzso In some tumors, where zzso abnormalities are too complicated to zzso zzso the technique of comparative zzso zzso zzso a competitive zzso allows examiners to determine complete or partial gain or loss of zzso zzso results allow the zzso of many tumor cell lines and along with other complementary techniques, like zzso zzso zzso increase the possibility of choosing an appropriate treatment for cancer zzso
