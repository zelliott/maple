The zzso zzso which we recently identified as a novel zzso mediates zzso zzso We evaluated the effects of zzso introduction of zzso zzso on 30 human zzso lines in zzso and two cell lines in zzso in comparison with the effects of zzso zzso In 20 of the 30 cell lines, zzso zzso was observed, and in 12 of these zzso cancer cell lines, the zzso effects of zzso were greater than those of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso which were thought to be zzso were likely to be sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in which no increase of zzso zzso expression was observed when zzso was introduced, were killed effectively by zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso had a synergistic effect on the induction of zzso regardless of zzso zzso Finally, zzso introduction of zzso suppressed tumor growth in zzso These results suggested that zzso gene transfer might become a new strategy for the treatment of zzso zzso
