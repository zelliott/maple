The development of a zzso zzso therapeutic instrument based on improved zzso zzso is introduced zzso It is based on the theory of radio frequency local zzso By adopting the improved zzso temperature control algorithm, the problem of the temperature control precision reduction due to tumor tissue characteristic changing by heating has been zzso thus ensuring homogeneous and smooth radio frequency heating to tumor zzso zzso demonstrate that the new zzso has strong zzso and zzso zzso the equipment works zzso and zzso and can control therapeutic temperature precisely zzso 2 degrees zzso which indicates a good clinical application zzso
