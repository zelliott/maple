zzso species is an uncommon pathogen that affects both zzso and zzso zzso The clinical and zzso spectrum of zzso has changed recently due to the widespread use of zzso zzso the emergence of new types of zzso patients, and the improved identification of zzso using molecular zzso zzso zzso was traditionally considered the zzso zzso and prophylaxis with zzso was considered almost universally zzso We conducted the current study to determine the zzso of zzso and its zzso and clinical characteristics in a general hospital over the last 12 zzso We reviewed the clinical records of all patients in whom zzso species was isolated from clinical specimens between 1995 and zzso zzso zzso were identified by standard procedures and by zzso end zzso zzso gene zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was determined by the broth zzso method following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory zzso zzso zzso of zzso infections did not increase significantly during the study period zzso inhabitants in zzso and zzso inhabitants in zzso zzso was recovered from 43 zzso Six were considered to be zzso The colonizing species were zzso zzso zzso nova, and zzso zzso All zzso patients had severe underlying pulmonary conditions and were treated with zzso (6 zzso or zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed in 37 patients zzso were men, and their mean age was zzso zzso zzso zzso The most common underlying condition in our institution was human zzso virus zzso infection (10 zzso zzso followed by chronic zzso pulmonary disease (8 zzso zzso zzso diseases (8 zzso zzso solid organ transplantation (7 zzso zzso and cancer (4 zzso zzso The most important risk factor for zzso was zzso administration zzso zzso zzso zzso affected the lungs in 26 cases zzso the skin in 3 cases zzso and the central nervous system in 2 cases zzso It was zzso in 5 cases zzso and caused zzso in 1 zzso The species identified were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nova zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso species zzso and zzso were zzso active against all the zzso whereas zzso of zzso showed intermediate zzso to zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso 2 zzso zzso were resistant to zzso and zzso were resistant to zzso zzso occurred while the patients were on zzso prophylaxis in 8 cases zzso The strains isolated from these patients were susceptible to zzso in 5 cases zzso and resistant in 3 zzso Overall, 13 patients died zzso related mortality was zzso (8 zzso We conclude that zzso infection has become the most common underlying condition for invasive zzso in our institution, followed by chronic lung zzso Previous use of zzso was the main risk factor and was present in more than half the zzso New species of zzso have been identified, and administration of zzso prophylaxis should no longer be considered highly reliable protection against zzso zzso studies of zzso are required to better identify risk factors associated with zzso and alternative and more effective methods of prevention must be zzso
