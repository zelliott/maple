A modified method of analysis by flow zzso has been adapted to the zzso cell system to monitor zzso formation within a mixed zzso The zzso zzso is based on the use of two zzso fluorescent markers in which an indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is used to detect zzso zzso cells and an zzso strain, zzso (red zzso is used to detect target zzso The two cell populations and their zzso are discernible by the presence of both green and red fluorescence, using a single laser beam tuned to zzso zzso In comparison, a manual count zzso zzso was applied using a zzso and zzso zzso Of the two methods, the automated technique using flow zzso provides a lower but more precise representation of zzso formation, due to the avoidance of zzso error that is common to manual count zzso The zzso method has proven to be zzso and superior in consistency to the manual count zzso and can be adapted to almost any zzso system under zzso In comparison with previous methods using dual laser, the single laser system provides advantages of cost and time efficiency due to setup zzso as well as improved zzso
