The use of a weighted sum of Kendall's zzso or a weighted sum of zzso zzso for testing association in the presence of a blocking variable is zzso In a zzso Carlo study the two are shown to have essentially the same power with the optimal choice of zzso In the presence of ties, the weighted sum of zzso zzso is preferred because its zzso has a much simpler zzso An example is given from the field of radiation zzso
