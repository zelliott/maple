Among new zzso zzso zzso and zzso and known zzso containing zzso and zzso compounds with an zzso group at zzso and an zzso ring at zzso and zzso isolated from stems and leaves of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso two zzso compounds remarkably reduced zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, seven zzso compounds increased cellular zzso of zzso in zzso tumor cells as potent as zzso while zzso and zzso compounds did not show such an zzso In addition, the zzso compounds enhancing zzso zzso inhibited competitively binding of zzso to zzso These results suggest that some zzso zzso may be useful for overcoming zzso in tumor zzso
