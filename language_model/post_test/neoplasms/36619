We describe the empirical performance of three zzso of spatial zzso zzso I, zzso c and a rank zzso statistic zzso in the analysis of regional cancer zzso zzso zzso in regional population sizes and age structure leads to variable precision in estimated zzso the usual methods for assessing I, c and D, which ignore such zzso are shown to be liberally zzso especially for c and zzso The power of these zzso to detect likely disease patterns is estimated by zzso the power is quite zzso depending on the exact pattern zzso although I tends to have the highest zzso The zzso zzso appear quite robust in small samples, even when several regions have no observed zzso zzso work on the Ontario cancer registry showed generally zzso effects on the spatial analysis of variation in case registration rates or missing residence zzso
