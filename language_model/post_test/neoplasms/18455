zzso zzso oxygen species zzso expression of a variety of genes in zzso cells has been suggested to be involved in abnormal cell zzso To prevent this by accelerated binding of zzso to zzso cells, human zzso zzso an zzso catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen zzso was fused with three repeats of zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso zzso at the zzso to obtain zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso and its derivatives were expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The specific activity and secondary structure of zzso and zzso were close to those of zzso but these derivatives showed higher binding to the mouse zzso vascular zzso cell line zzso than zzso indicating that they are zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso increased the zzso zzso level, the binding of mouse melanoma cells, and the activity of zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso or zzso efficiently inhibited these changes compared with zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are effective in zzso zzso tumor cell zzso to zzso zzso
