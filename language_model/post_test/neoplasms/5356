We present a hypothetical case study using the Years of Potential Life Lost zzso metric to compare cancer risks incurred by residents living near a Superfund site to occupational fatality risks incurred by workers employed in that site's zzso Since cancer occurs late in life, and because we assume its mortality rate is zzso each case results in zzso zzso Each occupational zzso which typically occurs earlier in life, results in zzso zzso In our case study, the residential population of zzso incurred zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso incurred by the 500 zzso Several uncertain assumptions may influence our calculations; moreover, occupational risks may be viewed as more zzso than risks incurred by zzso However, because the magnitude of the zzso incurred by workers and residents may be comparable, risk managers should consider occupational risks when evaluating remedial zzso
