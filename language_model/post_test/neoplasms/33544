Complete zzso the simplest method for allocating treatments to patients in clinical trials, can serve as a basis for zzso procedures using standard zzso tests, because the method ensures that each sequence of allocations is equally zzso No other method of allocation possesses this zzso However, many clinical trials employ allocation methods that force balance of zzso across treatment zzso With these methods, some allocation sequences are impossible or highly unlikely so that standard zzso tests are technically zzso In this article we investigate whether standard zzso tests for zzso outcomes are likely to yield distorted nominal p values in practical applications of these alternative allocation zzso A sample of completed trials conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group serves as a basis on which to construct zzso Our results indicate that nominal p values can be conservative, but are not likely to be severely distorted if the analysis is zzso by important zzso used as allocation zzso zzso the inherent zzso of exact methods due to zzso tends to dominate any additional zzso due to zzso zzso In addition, we investigate the relationship of treatment allocation methods with bias in estimates from a zzso model when important zzso are zzso This bias is the same for all zzso balanced allocation methods and is significant but not zzso
