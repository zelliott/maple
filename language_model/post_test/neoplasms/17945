Despite notable advances in the field, schizophrenia is still considered a major public health problem on international zzso The combination of frequency, zzso and severity make it, for some authors, the zzso of mental zzso However, according to the many cross-cultural studies, in particular, the two mammoth research projects of the WHO zzso and zzso it is now zzso that the course and outcome of schizophrenia are better in patients from developing zzso The reasons for better outcome and more favorable course of schizophrenia in developing countries are still far from clear and remain zzso 

We have carried out a study among a population of schizophrenic patients admitted to our hospital during the past year, to question the issues of outcome, course and prognosis in zzso which is an emerging country, ranking zzso between the most and the least developed zzso 

It appears that the outcome of schizophrenia is similar to that of developed zzso A community survey reported an annual prevalence of zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso patients with schizophrenia were admitted between August 2003 and 2004, representing zzso of the whole hospitalized population; zzso were former patients who had been hospitalized an average of 8 zzso One patient out of five will be readmitted at least once within the same zzso Only zzso were married, and zzso had a regular job, in spite of a high level of zzso A chronic course without zzso is not unusual and long stay patients now account for a fourth of the hospital zzso 

It seems clearly and paradoxically that the course and outcome of schizophrenia is deteriorating and getting closer to what is observed in the zzso zzso The same trend was observed in the western countries during the last centuries, leading some authors to claim that schizophrenia is a modern disease, which appeared in the zzso century and spread in the zzso Besides, other than the controversy regarding the recent evolution of its zzso it seems that we are not witnessing the anticipated decrease in zzso that comes with the therapeutic progress and the decline in fertility among individuals with zzso 

We shall discuss three hypotheses to try to explain the zzso of schizophrenia along with the economic development: the zzso of the disease with two clinical zzso a benign form zzso zzso more frequent in developing countries, and a severe form, observed mainly in developed zzso The progress in medicine and zzso which contributes to the survival of patients with serious schizophrenia and the vulnerable newborn exposed to multiple assaults and risk factors related to zzso The progress in psychiatry that is selecting the more serious zzso of zzso which are overrepresented zzso Research issues pertaining to course and outcome of schizophrenia are still zzso It is likely that prognosis of schizophrenia varies according to the economic development rather than to the zzso This observation could open new research and prevention zzso
