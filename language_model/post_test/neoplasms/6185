The zzso checkpoint gene zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso finger zzso is silenced by promoter zzso or zzso in various human zzso suggesting that zzso is an important tumor zzso Recent studies have reported that zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso resulting in the degradation of target zzso To better understand how zzso suppresses cell cycle progression and zzso we sought to identify zzso proteins using affinity zzso combined with mass zzso Here we show zzso zzso 1 zzso to be a novel zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso stress induced the zzso of zzso resulting in an enhanced interaction between zzso and zzso and an increase in the zzso of zzso The decrease in zzso protein levels promoted cell cycle arrest at zzso supporting that the cells expressing zzso were resistant to zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso cells, zzso was not induced in response to zzso zzso Thus, zzso protein levels did not decrease, and cells progressed into zzso under zzso stress, suggesting that zzso cancer cells were zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that cells from zzso knockout mice and zzso primary gastric cancer zzso expressed higher levels of zzso zzso strongly supporting our data that the interaction between zzso and zzso plays an important role in cell cycle regulation and cancer therapeutic zzso On the basis of our studies, we demonstrate a significant advantage for use of zzso chemotherapy with zzso zzso for cancer cells resistant to zzso zzso
