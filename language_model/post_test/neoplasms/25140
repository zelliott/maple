This zzso study tested the hypothesis that census tracts with elevated groundwater uranium and more frequent groundwater use have increased cancer zzso 

Data sources zzso incident total, zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso SC Central Cancer zzso demographic and groundwater use zzso US zzso and groundwater uranium zzso zzso from existing federal and state zzso zzso was used to predict average uranium zzso within zzso The relationship between uranium and standardized cancer zzso ratios was modeled among tracts with substantial groundwater use via linear or zzso regression, with and without zzso by the proportion of African Americans in each zzso 

A total of zzso cancer cases were zzso zzso with zzso groundwater use and uranium zzso in the upper zzso had increased risks for zzso breast, zzso zzso and total cancer compared to zzso zzso Some of these relationships were more likely to be observed among tracts populated primarily by African zzso 

SC regions with elevated groundwater uranium and more groundwater use may have an increased zzso of certain zzso although additional research is needed since the design precluded adjustment for race or other zzso factors at the individual zzso
