High content screening is a method for identifying small zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso The nature of the experiment generates an enormous amount of data in the form of photographic images of cells after treatment with compounds of zzso The interpretation of data from these experiments is challenging both in terms of automatically zzso the images, zzso and understanding differences between screened compounds and visualizing the zzso This paper discusses the application of statistical and visual methods that have been used to interpret data from a simplified DNA stain zzso screen to quickly identify compounds of zzso An understanding of the mechanism of action of the screened compounds can be obtained by comparing them to control compounds of known mechanism of zzso zzso and visual methods will be shown that facilitate easy comparison of screened compounds against these control zzso As an example, a subset of the internal zzso at zzso was screened, together with control compounds that were known to induce characteristic zzso zzso zzso data processing described in this paper permitted the easy identification of compounds that were similar to (and very different zzso the control zzso
