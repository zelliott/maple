Our molecular understanding of cancer biology has made substantial progress during the last two zzso During recent years it became evident that inflammation is a major driving force in tumor development since chronic virus infection and zzso are closely zzso These insights refined our view on the decisive role of persistent virus infection and chronic inflammation in tumor zzso growth, and zzso zzso zzso have been delivered how tumor cells interact and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso immune cells for shaping the so-called zzso and establishing zzso zzso This extended view on zzso diseases should now allow for rational design of interventions targeting inflammation and underlying pathways for prevention and therapy of zzso zzso This chapter outlines the role of zzso zzso in zzso thereby shedding light on the mechanisms of zzso inflammation and on characteristic features of the zzso which has been recently identified to play a key role in maintenance and progression of zzso Finally, the chapter discusses latest aspects in prevention of zzso cancer and provides a short outlook on the future prospects of cancer zzso
