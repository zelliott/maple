zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso tumors provides a potent cancer gene discovery tool in the zzso zzso To manage multiple zzso zzso zzso screening projects, we developed the zzso zzso Cancer Gene Database zzso zzso A sequence analysis pipeline determines the zzso position of each zzso integration site cloned from a mouse zzso the distance between it and the nearest candidate disease zzso and its orientation with respect to the candidate zzso The pipeline also identifies zzso regions that are targets of zzso integration in more than one tumor zzso integration sites, zzso and are thus likely to zzso a disease zzso Users can search the database using a specified gene symbol, zzso number or tumor model to identify both zzso genes and unique viral integration sites or compare the integration sites cloned by different laboratories using different zzso As a default setting, users first review the zzso zzso and then zzso zzso zzso zzso describe zzso and their candidate disease genes along with links to other public databases and clone zzso zzso zzso describe the viral integration site clones along with the tumor model and tumor type from which they were zzso candidate disease zzso zzso position and orientation of the integrated zzso with respect to the candidate zzso It also provides a pictorial view of the zzso location of each integration site relative to neighboring genes and zzso Researchers can identify zzso of interest and compare their results with those for multiple tumor models and tumor types using zzso
