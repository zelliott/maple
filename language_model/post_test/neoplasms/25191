DNA zzso based zzso have considerable potential for molecular zzso both as tumor specific zzso for the early detection or zzso monitoring of cancer as well as zzso and zzso zzso for therapeutic zzso Particularly in the former, the accurate zzso of DNA zzso is of compelling zzso However, zzso of DNA zzso has many traps for the zzso especially when zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso with varied DNA zzso patterns zzso is zzso The frequent occurrence of zzso zzso as distinct from a simple mixture of fully zzso and zzso zzso is generally not taken into account when DNA zzso is considered as a cancer zzso When zzso DNA zzso is present, the proportion of zzso molecules is difficult to zzso without a method that allows the measurement of individual zzso In this article, we critically assess the zzso frequently used to investigate DNA zzso with an emphasis on the detection and measurement of zzso DNA zzso The adoption of digital approaches will enable the effective use of zzso DNA zzso as a cancer zzso
