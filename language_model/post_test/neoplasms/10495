The expression of tissue factor zzso in tumors reportedly zzso the aggressiveness of several types of zzso The shedding of zzso membrane particles is believed to influence the ability of tumors to expand and zzso and these zzso may also be harmful in the onset of zzso zzso zzso in specific zzso Furthermore, the zzso signaling that is zzso after the formation of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso complex at the cell membrane zzso the activity of zzso molecules and zzso protein zzso zzso To evaluate whether zzso zzso in tumor cells zzso its shedding and neighboring zzso cells by its zzso or zzso activity, zzso zzso fluorescent zzso and a zzso form zzso were zzso expressed in the rat Morris zzso and human zzso zzso cell zzso Both zzso proteins were efficiently produced by tumor cells and functionally active, and their zzso activity could be blocked by the active zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso cells produced a soluble factor that increased the migration of zzso smooth muscle cells in zzso This effect was zzso by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso showing that it is dependent on the zzso activity of the zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso cell membrane zzso We propose that zzso zzso that are released in the culture medium by tumor cells influence the migratory behavior of neighboring zzso cells, thus aiding the cancer cell's zzso zzso
