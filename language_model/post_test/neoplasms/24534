The cellular zzso factor zzso is part of an zzso safeguard zzso it engages zzso pathways either alone or in cooperation with zzso to protect organisms from the development of zzso zzso activates downstream factors, which in turn produce secondary changes in gene expression that trigger zzso Although the mechanisms are incompletely zzso several studies have demonstrated that zzso is involved in many different aspects of programmed cell death depending on the cellular zzso Here, these findings are highlighted in the context of the most recent follow-up studies that have used zzso zzso genes as new zzso or drug targets, thereby providing insight into the basic mechanisms of zzso zzso and its possible clinical zzso
