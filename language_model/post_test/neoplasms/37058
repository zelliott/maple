zzso zzso is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a binding affinity to the zzso zzso and therefore it is to be assumed to block the zzso pumping zzso This open phase I study was conducted to determine the zzso tolerated dose zzso and safety of zzso administered zzso alone and in combination with zzso in patients with a zzso or locally advanced zzso Additionally, serum levels of zzso were assessed and compared between dosage groups to investigate the intravenous dose zzso The study was divided into two parts concerning zzso zzso In part I the patients received zzso for four hours daily over four consecutive days and additionally zzso zzso zzso at day zzso Treatment was started with 1 zzso and whenever the drug was well tolerated the dosage was zzso In part II the patients received up to three courses of a four-hour infusion (5 and 7 zzso of zzso followed by a continuous infusion for 48 hours (5 and 7 zzso Twenty-six patients entered this trial and were given at least one infusion of zzso zzso was given immediately after the zzso zzso One to seven courses and zzso from zzso zzso were zzso In five patients the dose limiting toxicity was seen in cardiovascular adverse events such as a drop in blood pressure, decreased heart rate and in one patient an zzso block zzso Most frequent adverse events were zzso zzso zzso peripheral zzso zzso zzso mild zzso zzso zzso all disappeared within 24 hours after zzso of zzso A linear increase in zzso serum concentration with increasing doses was found following intravenous infusion of zzso over a four-hour zzso zzso infusion regimes over a period of two or five days resulted in reasonably constant zzso serum zzso zzso was determined at 5 zzso It is to be assumed that the zzso for continuous infusion of zzso is higher than 5 zzso but this was not followed up in the study and must be the aim of a later zzso
