zzso breathing zzso has been associated with total and cardiovascular zzso but an association with cancer mortality has not been zzso zzso from in zzso and animal studies suggest that intermittent zzso promotes cancer tumor zzso 

The goal of the present study was to examine whether zzso is associated with cancer mortality in a community-based zzso 

We used 22-year mortality follow-up data from the Wisconsin Sleep zzso sample zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed at baseline with full zzso zzso was zzso using the zzso index zzso and the zzso index zzso sleep time below zzso zzso zzso The hazards of cancer mortality across levels of zzso severity were compared using crude and zzso zzso 

zzso for age, sex, body mass index, and smoking, zzso was associated with total and cancer mortality in a zzso zzso Compared with normal subjects, the adjusted relative hazards of cancer mortality were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for moderate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for severe zzso zzso zzso 30) zzso zzso zzso For categories of increasing severity of the zzso index, the corresponding relative hazards were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our study suggests that baseline zzso is associated with increased cancer mortality in a community-based zzso Future studies that replicate our findings and look at the association between sleep zzso and survival after cancer diagnosis are zzso
