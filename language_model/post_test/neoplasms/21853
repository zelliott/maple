zzso analysis shows that the chemotherapy innate resistance state of tumors is characterized zzso poorly dividing tumor zzso an increased DNA zzso an increased drug zzso potential by zzso and a dysfunctional zzso Because chemotherapy resistance involves multiple zzso zzso changes could be the main force responsible of this zzso Our hypothesis deals with the potential role of zzso therapy for affecting the chemotherapy resistant zzso of zzso zzso 

Recent studies reveal the involvement of DNA zzso and zzso modifications in the zzso of the zzso of zzso cells in zzso In this sense, it can be hypothesized that zzso zzso can participate in the establishment of an zzso mark associated with the chemotherapy resistant zzso If this were correct, then it could be expected that agents targeting DNA zzso and zzso zzso would by reverting the zzso mark induce a global expression profile that mirror the observed in zzso resistant zzso 

It is proposed to perform a detailed analysis using all the available databases where the gene expression of primary tumors was analyzed and data correlated with the therapeutic outcome to determine whether a zzso profiling of zzso is zzso Assuming an zzso programming determines at some level the intrinsic resistant zzso then a similar pattern of gene expression dictated by an zzso mark should also be found in cell acquiring drug zzso If these expectations are meet, then it should be further investigated at the zzso level whether these zzso are associated to certain patterns of DNA zzso and zzso zzso Once confirmed the existence of an zzso mark associated to either the intrinsic or acquired chemotherapy resistant zzso then a zzso association should be zzso These zzso findings should also be tested in a clinical zzso 

Our hypothesis on the ability of zzso therapy to zzso the zzso changes leading to a zzso profile that defines the resistant state will eventually be a more rational and effective way to treat zzso zzso
