The structure of gene sequences coding for the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated by Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso using a zzso full length zzso zzso While four hormones, zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso zzso only one gene that bears zzso sequences could be detected per zzso zzso The structure of this single zzso zzso zzso which contains intervening zzso is the same in DNA from first zzso and term zzso However zzso was observed for the presence of a zzso site and of an zzso zzso site in the zzso 3' zzso zzso The organization of zzso sequences in several zzso and zzso tumor cell lines, which produce zzso zzso was also zzso In each, the same gene copy number and structure were seen as in normal zzso Thus, the characteristics of zzso zzso expression in these cells seem not to be determined by DNA zzso
