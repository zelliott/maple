Since its discovery about 40 years ago, there has been a wide interdisciplinary research interest in zzso zzso on its zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved not only in metal zzso and zzso but also in scavenging free zzso during zzso zzso Among over zzso publications which can be retrieved by zzso search, only about 50 reports have been published on the relationship of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso In this review, we have evaluated critically the published data on the induced synthesis of zzso by radiation, and the potential functions of zzso in radiation induced cell zzso zzso zzso expression or zzso synthesis was found to be induced by exposure of cells in zzso or zzso in zzso to zzso or zzso zzso In most of the studies in animals and tissue cultures, high doses of zzso radiation were used to induce zzso and, therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate these results to low level of repeated zzso to radiation in zzso zzso synthesis of zzso is considered as one of the mechanisms involved in the zzso response to low dose radiation zzso The presence of zzso in normal cells may provide protective effects from zzso zzso and zzso However, in tumor cells, the presence of zzso can result in drug and radiation resistance as zzso These effects are modulated by other cellular factors, besides zzso such as zzso and by the cell cycle stages in cell proliferation and zzso
