In patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso will have prevalent cancer when zzso is diagnosed but little is known about such patients' long-term risk, time course and zzso of new zzso 

We studied an inception cohort of patients with a first zzso who were not diagnosed with cancer within 3 months after zzso and who had follow-up for up to 120 zzso We determined the annual risk for a new cancer zzso of events and zzso confidence zzso zzso per 100 zzso in all patients and in those with zzso zzso and identified zzso for new zzso 

We studied zzso patients with zzso who received zzso therapy for 12 months zzso and were followed for zzso years zzso During zzso there were 105 zzso patients diagnosed with new cancer during the period after the initial 3 months from diagnosis, for an annual risk of zzso zzso zzso per 100 zzso The risk for new cancer appeared uniform over zzso The annual risk for new cancer was more than zzso higher in patients presenting with zzso compared with those with provoked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per 100 zzso zzso Clinical zzso for new cancer were increasing age zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with a first zzso and without prevalent cancer, the risk for new cancer is about zzso per year, appears to be uniform over time, and is higher in patients with zzso zzso and those with advanced zzso
