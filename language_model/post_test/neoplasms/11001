zzso vaccination for cancer zzso requires an ideal immune response induced by zzso peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso is broadly expressed in various advanced zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso can serve as a universal zzso for tumor zzso However, due to the low zzso of zzso vaccines, an ideal immune response against tumors usually cannot be zzso in zzso To increase the zzso of zzso vaccines, we designed three zzso multiple zzso peptides zzso on the basis of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso of human zzso that we identified previously as zzso zzso Our results show that zzso vaccines based on the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso were capable of inducing zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Moreover, compared with their corresponding linear zzso zzso zzso vaccines zzso much stronger zzso of tumor cells by zzso zzso T zzso and increasing the releasing of zzso However, these zzso zzso did not lyse zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, which confirm the safety of these zzso zzso zzso our findings indicate that zzso vaccines based on zzso zzso of human zzso can be used as potent zzso for tumor zzso because of advantages such as broad spectrum, high effectiveness, high zzso and zzso
