Although a great deal of information has accumulated regarding the mechanisms underlying constitutional DNA zzso associated with inherited disorders, virtually nothing is known about the molecular processes involved in acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is one of the most common structural abnormalities observed in human zzso We previously identified a zzso cluster region for zzso formation in zzso and hypothesized that zzso architectural features could be responsible for this zzso To address this hypothesis, we precisely mapped the zzso zzso in 11 patients with different zzso zzso and determined the zzso structure of the involved zzso Our results reveal a complex zzso architecture in the zzso zzso cluster region, characterized by large ( approximately zzso zzso zzso repeats, strongly suggesting that zzso zzso are not random events but rather reflect zzso due to the zzso zzso
