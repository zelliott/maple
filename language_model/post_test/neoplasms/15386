Previous studies have suggested that increased physical activity may be protective against colon zzso Most of these studies measured activity zzso The present study evaluated several direct zzso of physical activity and also resting heart rate as determined from an zzso Increased activity was consistently associated with a decreased relative risk of colon cancer for each measure of zzso The colon cancer relative risk estimates for the middle and upper zzso of a physical activity index zzso with the lower zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative risk of colon cancer associated with moderate or heavy activity at zzso zzso with mostly zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar comparison of activity at work resulted in a relative risk estimate of zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative risk of colon cancer increased significantly zzso zzso zzso with increasing resting heart zzso Relative risks associated with physical activity were also evaluated for zzso of the stomach, zzso zzso zzso and urinary zzso An increased relative risk of stomach cancer was associated with several measures of increased activity, but these results are preliminary and additional research is necessary to further evaluate this zzso
