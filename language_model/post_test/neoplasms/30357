zzso and zzso define skeletal mass, structure and strength through their respective actions in zzso and forming zzso This zzso process is orchestrated by the actions of hormones and growth factors, which regulate a zzso system zzso the zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso and the soluble decoy zzso zzso zzso Bone zzso depends on zzso which determines zzso formation, activity and zzso zzso cells of the zzso lineage mainly provide zzso and therefore, are central in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso are inhibited by zzso a zzso zzso family member that binds zzso thereby preventing the zzso of its zzso zzso which is expressed by zzso zzso Because this zzso network is pivotal for the regulation of bone mass in health and diseases, including zzso zzso arthritis and zzso bone conditions, it has been successfully used for the generation of a targeted therapy to block zzso zzso The clinical approval of zzso a fully zzso zzso against zzso provides a novel option to treat bone diseases with a zzso targeted and zzso inhibitor of bone zzso Although zzso is also expressed by zzso cells, T zzso zzso zzso and various tumor cells, no meaningful clinical zzso effects have been reported after administration of zzso This article summarizes the molecular and cellular basis of the zzso system and presents zzso and clinical studies on the skeletal actions of zzso
