The ratio of intensity zzso of the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance from two zzso zzso acquired with a short zzso zzso and long zzso zzso pulse delay time is proposed to provide a potentially more sensitive and less variable marker of human zzso than the zzso zzso previously suggested zzso Fossel, zzso Carr, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation data are presented which demonstrate that the observed correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso arises from a combination of zzso differences and the relative amounts that zzso and zzso components contribute to the composite zzso zzso
