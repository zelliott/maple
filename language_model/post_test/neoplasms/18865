Cancer patients receiving high doses of zzso as background medication are challenging, and it would be useful clinically to know whether a zzso zzso zzso for breakthrough cancer pain zzso may be started at a dose zzso to the background zzso zzso 

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of the zzso zzso tablet zzso in doses zzso to the zzso dose administered for background analgesia in a sample of patients with zzso who were receiving high doses of zzso 

Twelve patients who were receiving zzso for background analgesia at doses equivalent to more than 500 zzso of oral zzso and had adequately controlled pain were zzso zzso zzso was treated with zzso doses of zzso patients receiving 600 zzso of oral zzso zzso were administered 1000 zzso of zzso patients receiving 900 zzso of oral zzso zzso were administered 1500 zzso of zzso and so zzso For each episode of zzso trained nurses collected pain intensity (on a zzso zzso rating zzso and emerging problems when called for increases in pain considered to be severe in intensity by patients zzso and 15 minutes after zzso administration zzso 

Patients were receiving mean doses of oral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso events were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso for each zzso The median pain intensity of zzso events was 8 zzso zzso and the mean dose of zzso administered was zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso In most events, a decrease in pain intensity zzso and zzso was observed zzso and zzso zzso 15 minutes after the administration of zzso Data on 11 episodes were zzso Only six events were unsuccessfully zzso In all the patients, the level of adverse effects after zzso administration was mild and indistinguishable from that associated with the background zzso zzso 

zzso in doses zzso to the high doses of zzso used for background analgesia was zzso and well tolerated when administered for zzso Controlled studies with a specific design and a large number of patients should confirm such preliminary zzso
