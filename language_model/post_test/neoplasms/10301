Whole body optical imaging using zzso or zzso is one of the most rapidly emerging technologies to zzso follow all kinds of molecular and cellular processes in small zzso Using zzso approaches it is now also possible to get better quantitative zzso Due to its sensitivity and simplicity it is now also widely used in drug development and drug zzso Finally, using near infrared fluorescent zzso that have much deeper penetration also opens up new exciting applications such as zzso image guided surgery for zzso zzso zzso mapping and radical zzso of zzso Recent advances in imaging strategies that reveal cellular and molecular biological events in real-time facilitate our understanding of biological processes occurring in living zzso The development of molecular zzso such as green fluorescent protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso red fluorescent proteins zzso from the zzso species zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the sea zzso zzso zzso has zzso research over the past decade, allowing complex zzso processes to be associated with the functioning of proteins in living zzso zzso technologies, both microscopic and zzso are developing zzso Recent technical advances for imaging weak visible light sources using cooled charged coupled device zzso cameras, zzso cooled detectors and zzso channel zzso allow detection of zzso zzso from inside the zzso of small zzso Whole body fluorescent imaging zzso and zzso imaging zzso are now applied to study zzso and zzso gene promoter activity and also to follow trafficking, differentiation and fate of zzso zzso or zzso and/or zzso expressing cells, or biological processes like zzso zzso interaction, zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging zzso and optical reporter systems are also very cost-effective and zzso and they are particularly well suited for small animal imaging and for in zzso zzso to validate different reporter zzso
