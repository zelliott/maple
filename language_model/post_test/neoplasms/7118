Using zzso methods for analysis of electronic databases we identified a number of human zzso sequences expressed predominantly in zzso We zzso studied one of the zzso which is related to the zzso database cluster zzso and located near the zzso in the zzso zzso All the zzso sequences of the cluster zzso are zzso and their role was not described yet, but expression pattern of the locus makes it theoretically and practically zzso Here we studied expression of the sequence zzso in various normal and tumor zzso using reverse zzso zzso chain zzso Of all the normal adult zzso studied weak expression was only identified in heart and zzso It was also identified in embryonic brain and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in tumors of various tissue origin including tumors of zzso zzso breast, stomach, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus the zzso locus is expressed predominantly in tumors and may be considered a prospective tumor zzso
