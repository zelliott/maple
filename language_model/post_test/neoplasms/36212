The objective of this paper is to evaluate an zzso maximum likelihood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstruction with total variation zzso zzso with respect to the zzso of the zzso due to data zzso Three different and (for clinical zzso typical classes of errors are considered for simulated phantom and measured projection zzso quantum noise, zzso detector zzso and projection zzso zzso To zzso those errors we apply error measures like mean square error, zzso ratio, zzso ratio and streak zzso These measures are derived from linear signal theory and generalized and applied for zzso signal zzso For quality check, we focus on resolution and zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso All comparisons are made versus the clinical standard, the filtered zzso zzso zzso In our results, we confirm and substantially extend previous results on zzso reconstruction such as massive zzso of the number of zzso Errors of projection zzso parameters of up to zzso projection angle zzso are still in the tolerance zzso Single zzso zzso exhibit ring artifacts for each zzso However using zzso zzso compensation, allows up to zzso of zzso zzso for passing the standard clinical quality zzso Further, the zzso zzso is extraordinarily robust in the low zzso regime (down to zzso zzso when compared to zzso allowing for extremely zzso image acquisitions, a substantial issue when considering daily zzso imaging for position correction in zzso We conclude that the zzso method studied zzso is robust under clinical quality assurance zzso zzso zzso regime imaging, especially for daily patient zzso in radiation therapy is possible without change of the current hardware of the imaging zzso
