The relevance of zzso zzso to the resistance of zzso walls against zzso invasion was investigated in human and zzso vessels using zzso zzso as zzso No significant differences in the zzso potential of extracts from the vascular walls were found between pulmonary and systemic zzso It is concluded that the zzso - inhibitor system studied is not responsible for the immunity of zzso walls against zzso zzso The lack of zzso resistance of pulmonary arteries may be explained by lesser zzso blood pressure and hence a lower pressure zzso across the vessel wall in pulmonary as opposed to systemic zzso
