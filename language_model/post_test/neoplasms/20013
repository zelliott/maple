We aimed to examine evidence for an infectious zzso among teenagers and young adults zzso by zzso monthly zzso of diagnosis and birth amongst zzso year zzso diagnosed with cancer in zzso 

Cases of zzso zzso and central nervous system zzso zzso were derived from the national zzso cancer register zzso zzso rates zzso and trends were assessed using zzso zzso zzso of diagnosis and birth was assessed using zzso and zzso zzso respectively with zzso functions of varying zzso 

There were zzso cases diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the overall zzso was 92 zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso year zzso per zzso was significant evidence of zzso around the time of diagnosis for Hodgkin's zzso zzso with a peak in February, and for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in December and zzso Birth zzso for those with zzso zzso zzso other than zzso and zzso were observed in May and November zzso 

Our novel findings support an infectious zzso hypothesis for certain zzso of zzso cancer in zzso Further work will examine correlation with specific infections occurring around the time of birth and diagnosis within certain diagnostic zzso
