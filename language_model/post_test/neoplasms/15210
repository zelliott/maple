This study assessed zzso response modification at three different dose levels zzso zzso and 15 zzso of zzso zzso administered by intravenous zzso three times zzso A final total of 24 patients were zzso zzso toxicity occurred at the highest dose level (15 zzso and included fatigue, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso response modification included assessment of zzso zzso zzso activity in peripheral zzso cells, measurement of serum beta zzso and expression of beta zzso on zzso measurement of zzso zzso Class II expression zzso zzso and measurement of hydrogen zzso generation by zzso 24 h after the first and fourth zzso zzso zzso increases zzso less than zzso from baseline were seen at 24 h with all parameters except zzso zzso Except for enhancement of zzso even the lowest dose zzso zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso effect was noted for changes in serum and zzso beta zzso levels but not for zzso zzso levels or zzso Class II zzso expression on zzso After 4 doses administered over 9 days, most parameters remained increased when compared to zzso but were not further enhanced when compared with levels attained after the first zzso The results of this study document the efficacy of zzso for biological zzso over a wide dose range and are consistent with the zzso that zzso effects of biological zzso can be obtained in man at doses substantially less than those that are zzso zzso Further documentation of zzso response parameters by zzso at low doses will be necessary to determine the importance of zzso zzso in relation to zzso zzso
