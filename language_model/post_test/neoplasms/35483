A real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system for potential in zzso use during zzso treatments is zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were grown in a zzso zzso and zzso using optical zzso zzso An zzso for the processing of the zzso signal was defined for use in real-time zzso and its performance was studied on data obtained with a zzso reader, using zzso zzso zzso zzso fading properties and temperature dependence of the signal were investigated in correlation with the concentration of zzso zzso in the zzso
