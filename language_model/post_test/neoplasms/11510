For many zzso virus zzso zzso it is still a matter of controversy whether infected cells harbor zzso or zzso integrated zzso zzso or zzso It is well established that the expression of zzso genes per zzso carries zzso potential, but the discrimination between zzso and integrated forms is of great relevance because integration events can contribute to the zzso properties of zzso whereas host cells that exclusively harbor viral zzso may not carry the risks zzso by zzso zzso This notion prompted us to establish a reliable technique that not only allows to unequivocally discriminate zzso from integrated zzso DNA, but also provides detailed insights into the zzso organization of the zzso Here, we show that dynamic molecular combing of host cell DNA combined with zzso in zzso zzso zzso using zzso DNA zzso facilitate zzso discrimination of zzso from integrated viral zzso Furthermore, the detection of highly zzso internal repeat 1 zzso sequences provides evidence that this method permits detection of major zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Thus, fiber FISH may also provide valuable insights into the zzso organization of viral zzso other than zzso
