zzso survival is dismal in most low-income countries, but initiatives for treating zzso cancer have substantially improved care in some of these zzso The My Child zzso zzso was launched to fund projects aimed at controlling zzso cancer in low-income and zzso zzso We aimed to assess baseline status of zzso cancer care in ten countries that were receiving support zzso Egypt, Honduras, Morocco, the Philippines, zzso Tanzania, Ukraine, Venezuela, and zzso 

Between Sept 5, 2005, and May 26, 2006, qualitative face-to-face interviews with zzso hospital managers, health officials, and other health-care professionals were done by a multidisciplinary zzso research company as a field zzso Estimates of expected numbers of patients with zzso cancer from zzso data were used to project the number of current and future patients for comparison with zzso zzso zzso survival was zzso on the basis of the findings of the zzso Data from the field survey were statistically compared with zzso health, and socioeconomic data from global health zzso The main outcomes were to assess baseline status of zzso cancer care in the countries and zzso zzso zzso 

The baseline status of zzso zzso care varied substantially between the surveyed zzso The number of patients reportedly receiving medical care zzso from survey zzso differed markedly from that predicted by zzso zzso zzso Management of zzso cancer and access to care were poor or deficient zzso nonexistent, zzso or inconsistent access for most children with zzso in seven of the ten countries surveyed, and accurate baseline data on zzso and outcome were very zzso zzso zzso survival were: zzso in Bangladesh, the Philippines, zzso Tanzania, and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in Egypt, Honduras, Ukraine, and zzso zzso zzso survival was directly zzso to several health indicators zzso capita annual total health-care expenditure zzso zzso zzso per capita gross domestic product zzso zzso per capita gross national income zzso zzso number of physicians zzso zzso and nurses zzso zzso per 1000 population, and most significantly, annual government health-care expenditure per capita zzso zzso 

zzso surveys can provide useful data for baseline assessment of the status of zzso zzso but cannot substitute for national cancer zzso zzso between public, private, and international agencies might rapidly improve the outcome of children with cancer in these zzso
