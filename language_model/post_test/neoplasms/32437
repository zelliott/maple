The correlation between detection of zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of primary breast, zzso zzso and gastric cancer was zzso Among patients with Stage zzso cancer treated by radical zzso with dissection of at least 10 zzso zzso 40 patients who suffered zzso within 5 years zzso and 94 patients who did not have recurrence within 5 years were randomly zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso for zzso to identify zzso Then the sensitivity, zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value of zzso were determined for predicting the recurrence of each zzso These parameters were respectively zzso zzso zzso and zzso for breast cancer, while the respective values were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for gastric zzso All of the parameters exceeded zzso for gastric zzso zzso also showed a high specificity for breast and lung cancer, but both the sensitivity and specificity were low for zzso zzso
