Our aim was to estimate the cumulative effective doses zzso from zzso procedures for a cohort of pediatric zzso zzso 

A retrospective cohort study of the imaging histories of 150 pediatric zzso patients (30 each in 5 subgroups, that is, zzso zzso brain tumors, zzso and assorted solid zzso for 5 years after diagnosis was zzso All procedures involving zzso radiation were recorded, including zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear medicine zzso studies, zzso and zzso zzso zzso estimates were zzso 

Individual zzso estimates ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso with a median of 61 zzso CT and zzso were the greatest zzso CT constituted zzso of procedures but zzso of the total zzso and zzso constituted zzso and zzso zzso There was considerable zzso between tumor zzso zzso estimates were highest in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 191 zzso zzso zzso zzso groups and lowest in the leukemia group zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso from diagnostic and zzso imaging for pediatric zzso patients vary considerably according to diagnoses, individual clinical courses, and imaging zzso zzso Increased awareness may promote strategies to reduce the radiation burden to this zzso
