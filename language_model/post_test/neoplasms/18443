zzso zzso and cancer are two of the main causes of zzso zzso which frequently share similar clinical features and zzso fluid zzso This study aimed to identify diagnostic models based on clinical and laboratory variables to differentiate zzso from zzso zzso zzso 

A retrospective study of zzso patients zzso with zzso zzso with zzso was zzso zzso analysis was used to select the clinical variables relevant to the models zzso zzso beta zzso were used to define a zzso score which presented a practical zzso The performances of the most efficient models were tested in a sample of zzso zzso zzso new zzso 

Two models are proposed for the diagnosis of zzso associated with each zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the absence of zzso cells in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and fluid zzso For zzso zzso patient age, fluid appearance, zzso percentage and presence of zzso cells in the zzso zzso and zzso as for zzso excluding zzso zzso Application of the models to the 64 zzso zzso showed accuracy higher than zzso for all zzso 

The proposed models were effective in suggesting zzso tuberculosis or zzso
