The growth of human tumor cells transplanted into zzso mice is frequently studied to gain understanding about the way potential drug treatments interfere with growth in zzso A wide range of methods is available for learning about specific aspects of tumor cell behavior, for example, cells may be administered to follow their ability to grow close to the site of injection which may be at a generic site or one specific to that type of zzso Some models of zzso follow the appearance of a tumor mass after zzso administration of tumor zzso others score remote growth after removal of a primary tumor implanted zzso Assessing zzso growth may increasingly rely on serial observation of tumor cell numbers as seen by zzso imaging, but the sensitivity of these methods is poor in terms of the minimum number of cells zzso and zzso follow-up to establish tumor cell numbers can be zzso by variable expression or even zzso of reporter zzso Here we describe how zzso in zzso zzso zzso using commercially available zzso can very easily be used to detect even single zzso tumor cells in mouse models, using routinely fixed and processed tissue samples, and without the tumor cell lines needing to express engineered reporter zzso The FISH protocol can be combined with other standard zzso protocols to study the behavior of tumor cells and adjacent host cells to improve our understanding of zzso zzso and is also useful for simultaneous demonstration of the cell of origin and zzso of cells used in zzso zzso zzso
