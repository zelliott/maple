Childhood chronic diseases, especially cancer, are of growing zzso Research has focused on 2 zzso zzso prenatal and zzso While it is hypothesized that chemical zzso in the physical environment may play a role in the development and zzso of many chronic diseases, the role of environmental zzso in the zzso of these conditions remains zzso This can be somewhat attributed to the fact that it is very difficult to efficiently link chronic health effects with environmental zzso that are likely to have occurred temporally and zzso distant from zzso This study explored the utility of linking childhood cancer cases with their birth certificate data as a method for increasing the number of zzso data points available for linking health effect data with environmental monitoring zzso This would begin to zzso the zzso of 1 subset of the population, and provide a basis for characterizing and zzso zzso for exposure to numerous environmental zzso during prenatal and zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso cancer diagnosis records of children who were both born and diagnosed with cancer in Wisconsin between 1995 and 2002 were linked with birth records to explore the zzso between address at birth and zzso The majority of records were matched to a birth record file zzso Of these matched records, zzso moved zzso mile from birth to time of zzso The results suggest that administrative and public health surveillance data can be used to zzso zzso Data from the sample tested indicate that during the given time period children do not move far from their birth homes, suggesting minimal changes in exposure potential related to residence location from birth to zzso This background is useful for future zzso investigations linking environmental factors with chronic health zzso
