The term zzso has been used by scientists and health regulatory officials for zzso During the last 20 years there have been attempts to redefine the term to make it more zzso But, as predicted two decades ago by a zzso subcommittee of the National Cancer Advisory Board, advances in scientific understanding have brought about dramatic changes in the way we are able to view the term zzso These changes, their scientific bases and their effect on defining the term zzso are zzso An alternative to the use of the term zzso is suggested by the recently proposed US Environmental Agency's guidelines for cancer risk assessment which appear to be in zzso with current scientific understanding and the importance of considering the factors affecting the term zzso The guidelines set forth four questions, the answers to which could, in our judgment, replace the need to define or use the term zzso which, in light of new scientific knowledge, has become more misleading than zzso
