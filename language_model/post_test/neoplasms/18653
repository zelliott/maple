The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum zzso kinetic energy required to treat a given percentage of patients eligible for zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso therapy, contingent upon the number and location of zzso angles zzso Treatment plans from 100 consecutive patients treated with zzso at the University of Wisconsin zzso Cancer Center between June of 2007 and March of 2010 were zzso For each target volume within each patient, in-house software was used to place zzso pencil beam spots over the zzso surface of the target volume from 51 zzso zzso angles of up to zzso For each beam spot, the zzso path length from the surface of the patient to the zzso boundary of the target was then calculated along a ray from the zzso location to the location of the beam zzso This data was used to generate a maximum zzso energy requirement for each patient as a function of the arc length that would be spanned by the zzso angles used in a given zzso If only a single treatment angle is required, zzso of the patients included in the study could be treated by a zzso beam with a maximum kinetic energy of 118 zzso As the length of the treatment arc is increased to zzso zzso zzso and zzso the maximum energy requirement increases to zzso zzso zzso and 179 zzso zzso A very high percentage of zzso patients could be treated at relatively low zzso energies if the zzso angles used in the treatment plan do not span a large treatment zzso zzso zzso kinetic energy requirements increase zzso with size of the treatment zzso
