A large-scale zzso was performed by zzso zzso individual zzso clones derived from human zzso zzso and normal liver zzso into human zzso cells and zzso zzso clones into mouse zzso zzso zzso Based on the results of colony formation in zzso cells and zzso formation in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso species zzso zzso were found to possess the ability of either stimulating or zzso cell zzso Among them, zzso zzso zzso were known zzso zzso zzso zzso were previously zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso of zzso structure and zzso A comprehensive analysis of the genes and the potential mechanisms for their involvement in the regulation of cell growth is zzso The genes were classified into four zzso I, genes related to the basic cellular mechanism for growth and zzso II, genes related to the cellular zzso III, genes related to zzso systemic zzso and IV, genes of zzso zzso The extensive zzso activity of genes with such highly diversified functions suggests that cancer may be related to multiple levels of cellular and systemic zzso The present zzso provides a direct zzso functional screening zzso It offers a better understanding of the basic machinery of zzso including previously zzso systemic regulatory mechanisms, and also provides a tool for gene discovery with potential clinical zzso
