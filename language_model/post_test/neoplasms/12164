To evaluate the zzso accuracy of the zzso zzso zzso score in patients with advanced cancer under the care of an zzso 

The zzso score was calculated in 100 consecutive patients with advanced cancer hospitalized under the care of a medical or radiation zzso at a university teaching hospital in zzso The attending zzso predicted the survival duration for the purpose of the zzso The positive zzso value of the zzso score was zzso Survival analysis was performed to compare the survival of the three zzso zzso 

zzso survival data were available for 98 zzso The overall median survival was 12 weeks zzso range, 7 to 25 zzso The zzso score divided the zzso patient sample into three zzso groups related to the chance of surviving 1 month, with 64 patients in group A zzso zzso zzso 32 patients in group B zzso to zzso zzso and four patients in group C zzso zzso zzso The estimated median survival of the three groups was 17 weeks zzso zzso 12 to 26 weeks), 7 weeks zzso zzso 4 to 12 weeks), and less than 1 week zzso zzso zzso 1 to 3 weeks), zzso These survival differences were highly significant zzso test of trend, zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso survival of the groups was zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

When zzso survival estimates are used, the zzso score is able to identify accurately three zzso patient groups, irrespective of the cancer zzso The zzso score may help reduce the uncertainty of zzso a prognosis in patients with advanced zzso
