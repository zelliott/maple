zzso is a trace element that is essential for the normal function of zzso It is a zzso for the structure and function of a wide range of cellular proteins including zzso zzso factors, and structural zzso Recent studies have shown that zinc plays a role in the development of various zzso Unfortunately no established common relationships of zinc with cancer development and progression have been zzso zzso is known to have systemic effects such as regulation of the immune system as well as direct cellular effects resulting in regulation of gene zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and cell zzso zzso is also reported to regulate cell proliferation and zzso In this review presentation we focus on the effects of zinc that are involved in the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso We selected the zzso effects of zinc because zinc is reported to both induce zzso in some zzso and to protect other cancer cells against zzso induced by other zzso The effects of zinc in the regulation of zzso appear to be cell type zzso More zzso the reported effects of zinc on cancer cells must be viewed from the perspective of the zzso regulation of zinc zzso Thus one must be mindful of the experimental conditions under which zinc effects are investigated relative to the zzso and pathological conditions of cellular zinc distribution and zzso that can exist in zzso
