The zzso zzso system zzso is a network of zzso and peptides that coalesce primarily on the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso to induce cell zzso zzso fibrosis, and blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso the key zzso of the zzso is zzso in that it zzso other zzso such as substance P and zzso zzso evidence implicates zzso in the zzso of zzso While the role of zzso and its zzso network in modulating zzso via the zzso is well zzso its involvement in shaping other aspects of the tumor zzso remains largely zzso Here, we review the role of zzso in modulating the immune compartment of the tumor zzso which encompasses the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, alternatively activated zzso zzso and T regulatory zzso We also discuss the potential roles of peptides that accumulate in the setting of chronic zzso inhibitor use, such as zzso substance zzso and zzso zzso and how they may undercut the gains of zzso from zzso zzso These emerging mechanisms may harmonize the zzso results on the role of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in various zzso and call for further investigations into the potential benefit of zzso zzso in some zzso
