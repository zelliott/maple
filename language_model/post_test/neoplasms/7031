zzso codes for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso domain and zzso domain are common in several zzso We studied the zzso properties of a common zzso domain zzso zzso and a common zzso domain zzso zzso Both retain the ability to zzso zzso of zzso and are also inhibited by a range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to a similar extent as zzso zzso Both zzso display an increased zzso but while a zzso derived zzso caused an increase in zzso for zzso zzso it did not for the zzso zzso and actually decreased zzso for the zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso was activated by zzso whereas the zzso zzso was zzso Together these results suggest zzso domain zzso are in a state mimicking zzso by growth factors whereas zzso domain zzso mimic the state activated by zzso
