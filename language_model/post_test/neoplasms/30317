As stem cells are capable of zzso and can generate differentiated zzso for organ development, they are considered as potential source for zzso medicine and tissue replacement after injury or zzso Along with this capacity, stem cells have the therapeutic potential for treating human diseases including zzso According to the origins, stem cells are broadly classified into two zzso embryonic stem cells zzso and adult stem zzso In terms of differentiation potential, zzso are zzso and adult stem cells are zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso that contains the fetus and zzso fluid and functions in protecting the developing zzso during zzso is another stem cell zzso zzso stem cells are classified as human zzso zzso zzso stem cells, human zzso zzso zzso stem cells and human zzso zzso stem zzso They are in an intermediate stage between zzso zzso and zzso adult stem cells, zzso and contribute to low zzso and zzso Furthermore, they are easily available and do not cause any controversial issues in their recovery and zzso Not only are zzso stem cells zzso in zzso medicine, they have zzso zzso In zzso stem cells transplantation strategies, zzso stem cells effectively target the tumor and suppressed the tumor growth by expressing zzso zzso Additionally, they also have a potential as novel delivery vehicles transferring therapeutic genes to the cancer formation sites in zzso zzso combination zzso zzso to their own advantageous properties, zzso stem cells are emerging as a new candidate in zzso zzso
