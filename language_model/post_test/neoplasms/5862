The zzso zzso gene and two zzso resistance genes cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso The zzso resistance genes zzso and zzso endowed zzso zzso with high-level resistance to zzso indicating that the resistance mechanism for zzso might be different from that for zzso zzso Transformation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso gene zzso resulted in the production of many red zzso A new zzso was zzso and the position of the newly introduced zzso group was zzso This result indicated that the zzso zzso gene was zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and that it gave rise to a hybrid zzso A which showed highly specific in zzso zzso against leukemia and melanoma cell zzso
