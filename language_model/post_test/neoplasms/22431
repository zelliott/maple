zzso zzso is the zzso zzso constituent present in black seed oil zzso zzso and has been tested for its efficacy against zzso Here, we zzso the literature about zzso molecular mechanism of action and its ability to induce zzso and inhibit tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso has zzso effects, and it zzso tumor cell proliferation through zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso by zzso is mostly limited to in zzso studies, and it has potential in therapeutic strategy for zzso The results favor efficacy and enhancement of therapeutic benefit against tumor cells resistant to therapy based on cellular targets that are molecular zzso for cancer cell survival and zzso There have been attempts to zzso novel zzso of zzso directed toward superior effects in killing tumor cells with more enhanced zzso potential than parent zzso zzso Based on published reports, we believe that further in-depth studies are warranted including investigation of its zzso and Phase I toxicity profiling in human zzso The results from such studies will be instrumental in advancing this field in support of initiating clinical trials for testing the effects of this ancient agent in cancer zzso
