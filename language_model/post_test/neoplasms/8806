zzso persists over whether cancer risk is increased in communities surrounding oil fields, especially in the zzso region of zzso This zzso study uses quantitative exposure data, updated mortality data, and improved statistical methods to study the impact of oil exploration and production activities on cancer mortality rates in the zzso 

Cancer mortality rates in the zzso in 1990 through 2010 were compared between seven zzso with active oil exploration and production as of 1990 and thirteen zzso with little or no such zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate mortality rate ratios zzso adjusted for age and zzso In a zzso analysis, zzso zzso were zzso against quantitative estimates of cumulative barrels of oil produced and zzso per zzso adjusting for zzso demographic and socioeconomic zzso 

zzso and zzso cancer mortality rates were comparable between oil-producing and zzso zzso For overall cancer mortality in males and females combined, the zzso comparing oil-producing to zzso zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso For leukemia zzso the corresponding zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also revealed no excess of mortality from acute zzso zzso or childhood zzso zzso mortality ratios were consistent with zzso zzso zzso showed no pattern in relation to oil production volume or zzso 

zzso from this first zzso study to incorporate quantitative measures of oil exploration and production showed no association between the extent of these activities and cancer zzso including from zzso associated with zzso zzso
