The purpose of this study was to determine the variation in relative output factors for fields shaped using a zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso A total of 21 different clinical fields from 16 patients were compared by casting zzso blocks from the same films that had generated the zzso zzso zzso zzso were made on a zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso leaves per zzso in solid water for 6 and 20 zzso at zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso and at two zzso 5 zzso zzso and the clinically prescribed depth zzso All zzso were taken under the central axis of the beam unless the shaped field was obviously skewed off axis or the beam was zzso Several cases were repeated on a zzso zzso (40 1 zzso leaves per zzso zzso For the 21 cases zzso the average overall zzso factor zzso reading divided by the block zzso was found to be zzso with a standard zzso of zzso Repeat zzso performed on the zzso were within zzso of the zzso factors measured (for the same fields) on the zzso When the data are broken down in terms of clinical applications zzso of case at a clinically prescribed depth and zzso the resulting total clinical average is zzso with a standard zzso of zzso Both the overall average and the total clinical average zzso factors zzso agree with previous literature, which used abstract or generic field zzso Further investigation of the data from this study may find a correlation between the zzso factor and the percent of open zzso
