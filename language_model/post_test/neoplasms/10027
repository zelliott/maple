Four human cancer cell lines zzso 7, T zzso zzso 75 and zzso each of which possess zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso of cells with zzso resulted in two effects on their zzso zzso First, the ability of zzso zzso to respond to further stimulation by zzso was zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells had increased activity of zzso zzso compared with control zzso the activated state not only surviving washing and zzso steps but zzso for some hours after the removal of hormone from the incubation zzso This phenomenon has therefore been termed zzso zzso and may be peculiar to the action of zzso It is dose dependent and is seen with zzso of various origins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso hormone was removed from the cell surface by acid zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso fell towards control activities and responsiveness of the zzso to a second challenge with zzso zzso zzso of protein synthesis prevented full recovery from zzso but had no effect on the return towards control of residual zzso activity in zzso zzso These results are consistent with continued zzso occupancy leading to a persistent zzso of zzso zzso until zzso of the zzso has zzso
