The concept of using replicating viruses as zzso agents is not a new one, but the ability to genetically modify these viruses into increasingly potent and zzso zzso is a recent zzso As more is learned about the functions of viral gene products in controlling the zzso cell cycle and in disabling cellular defense mechanisms, specific viral functions can be zzso or eliminated to enhance zzso zzso In this article, general mechanisms by which zzso viruses achieve their zzso efficacy and specificity are zzso The paradoxical roles of the immune response are addressed with respect to zzso viral therapy, as it, on one hand, zzso the spread of viral infection, and on the other, zzso tumor cell destruction through the recruitment of T cells zzso against tumor zzso The most commonly used zzso viruses are each reviewed in turn, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso Special attention is focused on the unique biology of each of these viruses as well as the status of several of these zzso in clinical zzso
