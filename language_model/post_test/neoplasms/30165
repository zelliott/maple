For the elderly, the association between waist circumference zzso and mortality considering body mass index zzso remains zzso and thereby also the evidence base for using these zzso measures in clinical zzso This zzso examined the association between zzso categories and zzso mortality within zzso zzso Furthermore, the association of continuous zzso with lowest and increased mortality risks was zzso 

zzso and zzso relative risks zzso of mortality associated with zzso categories and continuous zzso (including zzso and zzso were calculated by the investigators and pooled by means of zzso zzso 

During a zzso of zzso men and zzso women, we zzso zzso and 1480 deaths, zzso A large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso mortality zzso for those in the zzso weight zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso category compared with the zzso weight zzso zzso and a small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with highest zzso mortality zzso in men zzso zzso zzso zzso and women zzso zzso zzso zzso We found a zzso association for continuous zzso with zzso cardiovascular zzso and cancer, and a zzso association with respiratory disease mortality zzso An zzso zzso mortality zzso of zzso was associated with a zzso of 132 zzso zzso zzso in men and 116 zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

Our results showed increased mortality risks for elderly people with an increased zzso across zzso zzso and for those who were classified as zzso using zzso The results provide a solid basis for zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
