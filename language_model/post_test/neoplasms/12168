Evidence has accumulated from zzso animal experiments and zzso human zzso studies that lifestyle factors that affect energy balance, such as caloric zzso nutritional status, and exercise, act in concert with genetic zzso to influence cancer development and zzso The use of animal models with specific genetic zzso in combination with lifestyle modifications that alter overall energy balance, has contributed to a greater understanding of the zzso changes occurring during zzso and to the identification of points of zzso Studies in our laboratory focusing on the role of energy balance and genetic zzso in mice deficient in one zzso or both zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene and mice with a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that calorie restriction decreases tumor burden, increases tumor zzso and decreases serum zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso Data from our studies, combined with results from other animal and human studies, have established a role for IGF-1 in zzso Studies using genetic models of cancer that have been zzso with mice with abnormal levels of IGF-1 will enable the examination of combined effects of energy balance and genetic zzso on the cancer zzso Models that integrate lifestyle and genetic effects in a single system provide a zzso intact system in which combination interventions and therapies for cancer prevention can be tested and zzso thus building a strong zzso foundation that will inform the development of clinical trials and add perspective to zzso zzso
