zzso zzso is considered to be a critical step in cancer progression due to its role in cellular zzso The prevalence of zzso expression in human zzso makes it an attractive candidate for new zzso targets for cancer zzso The selective killing of cancer cells can be achieved by zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso In this study we have tested the feasibility of using the zzso regulatory sequences from the zzso and zzso genes to regulate expression of the bacterial zzso zzso in combination with the zzso zzso in a suicide gene therapy zzso zzso and zzso promoter activity was compared in a panel of 10 cell lines and showed a wide distribution in zzso low activity was observed in normal cells and zzso zzso zzso cell lines, with up to zzso higher activity observed in zzso positive cancer zzso zzso the zzso gene under the control of the zzso gene promoters zzso cancer cells in tissue culture to the zzso zzso and promoter activity was zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with cell death restricted to lines exhibiting high levels of promoter zzso The in zzso relevance of these data was tested using two zzso models zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction was seen with both zzso promoters and the zzso patterns of zzso observed in tissue culture were retained in zzso zzso Thus, zzso suicide gene therapy zzso expressing bacterial zzso sensitize human cancer cells to the zzso zzso
