zzso is a key zzso of zzso growth and zzso and is considered central to the formation of zzso zzso zzso This study examined the relationship between levels of zzso and its soluble zzso zzso in the zzso fluid and plasma of patients with zzso zzso zzso and their association with zzso outcomes and zzso 103 patients with zzso zzso zzso were recruited at their first zzso zzso was to 6 months or zzso Survival and zzso outcomes were robustly zzso zzso and zzso were measured in zzso fluid and plasma by zzso zzso and zzso were present in significantly higher zzso in zzso fluid than zzso There was no significant correlation between zzso within or between sample zzso There was no association between baseline zzso fluid zzso or zzso levels and zzso zzso In both sample types, survival was zzso associated with zzso and within the zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso a highly significant association between increased zzso fluid zzso and zzso and reduced survival was demonstrated zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that zzso can be zzso measured in zzso fluid from zzso zzso High levels at presentation in those with zzso cell zzso are strongly associated with poor zzso
