zzso protein 78 zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso and a major regulator of the unfolded protein response zzso zzso evidence indicate that zzso is zzso in many cancer cell lines, and contributes to the invasion and zzso in many human zzso Besides, zzso zzso is detected in response to different zzso zzso zzso therapies, including zzso therapy zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso and protein levels are elevated in response to zzso in various cancer cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso its zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fused with zzso growth factor zzso zzso various cancer cells to zzso zzso The combination treatment is zzso to zzso zzso lung cancer cells, as well as to zzso and zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso In these cells, zzso and zzso zzso induce protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 branches of zzso and also increase the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although some zzso events such as disruption of zzso membrane and zzso zzso are detected after zzso there is no zzso plasma membrane zzso or DNA zzso suggesting that in zzso cells the late zzso events are zzso Moreover, in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death but zzso zzso zzso In addition, the cell death cannot be reversed by zzso inhibitor zzso confirming that zzso is not a major cell death mode triggered by the combination zzso Moreover, no typical features of zzso or zzso cell death are zzso Instead, an extensive cellular zzso of zzso origin is zzso Altogether, these findings indicate that zzso and zzso zzso treatment can efficiently kill cancer cells independent on their zzso competence and triggers an zzso zzso cell zzso
