Most expression profiling studies of solid tumors have used biopsy samples containing large numbers of zzso zzso and other cell types, thereby complicating any precise zzso of gene expression in zzso versus tumor cell zzso Combining laser capture zzso zzso amplification zzso zzso technologies and our knowledge of the human zzso zzso it is possible to isolate pure populations of cells or even a single cell and interrogate the expression of thousands of sequences for the purpose of more precisely defining the biology of the tumor zzso Although many of the studies that currently allow for characterization of small sample preparations and single cells were performed utilizing zzso cell types, and in some cases isolation protocols other than laser capture zzso a list of protocols are described that could be used for the expression analysis of individual tumor zzso Application of these experimental approaches to cancer studies may permit a more accurate definition of the biology of the cancer cell, so that ultimately, more specific targeted therapies can be zzso
