zzso tumor motion is known to cause artifacts on zzso spiral CT images used in treatment zzso This leads to inaccurate zzso of target volumes on planning CT zzso zzso zzso has been used previously for zzso during CT scans and radiation treatments using the active breathing control (ABC) zzso We have developed a zzso by extending the zzso zzso device to obtain gated CT scans using a zzso zzso zzso CT zzso To test our prototype, we designed motion zzso to compare image quality obtained with and without gated CT scan zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso CT scans were obtained of zzso with motion periods of 3-5 s and zzso of zzso zzso Errors observed in the volume estimate of these structures were as much as zzso with moving zzso during CT zzso Application of zzso CT with active breathing control reduced these errors to within zzso zzso CT was then implemented in patients and the results are presented for two clinical zzso lung and zzso In each case, gated scans were acquired at zzso zzso in addition to a conventional zzso zzso zzso The gated CT scans revealed reduced artifacts compared with the conventional zzso zzso zzso of up to zzso in the volume of the structures were observed between gated and zzso zzso A comparison of the overlap of structures between the gated and zzso scans revealed zzso of the zzso These results demonstrate the ability of zzso zzso to reduce errors in target volumes via gating during CT zzso
