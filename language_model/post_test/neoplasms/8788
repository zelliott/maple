Our survey assessed the use of advanced zzso technologies at the designated cancer care hospitals in Japan, and we identified several issues to be zzso 

We collected the data of zzso designated cancer care hospitals, including information on staffing in the department of radiation zzso zzso radiation zzso medical physicists and radiation zzso the number of linear zzso and the zzso of advanced zzso technologies from the Center for Cancer Control and Information Services of the National Cancer Center, zzso 

Only zzso zzso designated cancer care hospitals and zzso regional designated cancer care hospitals have implemented zzso zzso for head and neck zzso and zzso zzso designated cancer care hospitals and zzso regional designated cancer care hospitals use zzso zzso for prostate zzso zzso percent zzso designated cancer care hospitals and zzso regional designated cancer care hospitals employ zzso body zzso for lung zzso Our zzso analysis of zzso designated cancer care hospitals which satisfy the institute's qualifications for advanced technologies revealed the number of radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso and that of radiation therapists zzso zzso zzso were significantly correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso for prostate cancer, and the number of radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with the zzso of zzso body zzso There was a trend to correlate the number of medical physicists with the zzso of zzso body zzso zzso zzso zzso Only 175 zzso regional designated cancer care hospitals satisfy the institute's zzso of zzso body zzso and 76 zzso satisfy that of zzso zzso zzso percent zzso designated cancer care hospitals and zzso regional designated cancer care hospitals had a quality assurance zzso 

The numbers of radiation zzso and other operating staff might be essential factors in the zzso of advanced zzso zzso Small proportions of regional designated cancer care hospitals satisfy the institute's qualifications of advanced zzso
