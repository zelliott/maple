A study was undertaken to determine the potential value of DNA flow zzso zzso for the diagnosis of zzso in zzso zzso and to compare its results with those of traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso from 37 patients were evaluated by DNA zzso and routine zzso zzso Of the 41 zzso zzso 29 zzso demonstrated an abnormal DNA content by zzso Two of the 29 zzso zzso had been originally diagnosed as benign by zzso zzso review of these two cases showed no abnormal zzso therefore, there were no zzso cases based on zzso In 12 zzso of the 41 zzso DNA zzso and zzso evaluation both indicated benign zzso Our preliminary observations indicate that zzso is an accurate and reliable technique that may be of aid in the diagnosis of zzso zzso The technique may prove to be of special value in the differential diagnosis of zzso zzso cells versus zzso zzso as well as for following patients who receive chemotherapy for zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso may also complement zzso diagnoses in other zzso zzso or aspiration zzso
