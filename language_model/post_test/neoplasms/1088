This study is aimed at investigating the in zzso zzso activity of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso effects of zzso therapy by targeting the tumor zzso 

We analyzed the zzso effects of zzso alone or combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso on human tumor zzso by measuring tumor growth and mouse survival in zzso zzso nude and zzso zzso The drug delivery, immune response, and zzso status in treated tumors were assessed by high performance liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We developed a nontoxic and zzso zzso zzso zzso which can only be activated by zzso zzso to become severely zzso zzso possesses potent zzso activity against human tumor zzso in zzso zzso nude mice but not for tumors implanted in zzso mice deficient in zzso and zzso suggesting that these cells play an important role in zzso zzso in the tumor zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and prolonged survival of mice bearing resistant human colon tumor zzso by providing strong zzso activity and zzso delivery through enhancing inflammatory cell zzso and zzso tumor vessels in the tumor zzso We also show that inflammatory cells zzso were highly infiltrated in advanced human colon cancer zzso compared with normal zzso 

Our study provides in zzso evidence that zzso has potential for zzso zzso or in combination with zzso treatment for tumors with zzso of zzso or zzso inflammatory zzso
