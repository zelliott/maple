Our zzso in pathology, on observing cancer tissue under the microscope in the mid-19th century, noticed the similarity between embryonic tissue and cancer, and suggested that tumors arise from zzso cells zzso zzso le zzso du zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Archiv zzso zzso zzso und zzso und zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso The concept that adult zzso contain embryonic remnants that generally lie zzso but that could be activated to become cancer was later zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso 65 (1875) zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso di zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso as the zzso zzso theory of zzso An updated version of the zzso rest theory of cancer is that zzso arise from tissue stem cells in zzso Analysis of the cellular origin of zzso of different zzso indicates that there is, in each instance, a determined stem cell required for normal tissue renewal that is the most likely cell of origin of zzso zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso In the present review, the nature of normal stem cells zzso zzso and zzso is presented and their relationships to cancer are further zzso Cell signaling pathways shared by embryonic cells and cancer cells suggest a possible link between embryonic cells and cancer zzso zzso tumors zzso and zzso are presented as possible tumors of embryonic rests in zzso zzso is used as the classic example of the zzso cancer stem cell which can be influenced by its environment to differentiate into a mature adult zzso The observation that zzso of an zzso cancer may be accomplished months or even years after the initial exposure to zzso zzso implies that the original zzso event occurs in a zzso zzso stem cell zzso The cellular events during zzso illustrate that zzso may arise from cells at various stages of differentiation in the zzso zzso Examples of genetic zzso in zzso and zzso zzso show how specific zzso in gene expression may be zzso as maturation arrest of a cell lineage at a specific stage of zzso zzso the signals that control normal development may eventually lead us to insights in treating cancer by inducing its differentiation zzso zzso zzso acid zzso induced differentiation therapy has acquired a therapeutic niche in treatment of acute zzso leukemia and the ability of zzso to prevent cancer is currently under zzso
