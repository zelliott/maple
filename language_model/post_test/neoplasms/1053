zzso alpha is a type I zzso zzso protein involved in tumor progression and other severe diseases, including zzso and as such could be considered as a potential drug zzso In addition to zzso activity, zzso possesses cell binding and cell signaling zzso This functional zzso is reflected in the structure of zzso which can be divided into head, body, and zzso The head of the protein zzso of the pro and zzso zzso mediates processing of growth factors and zzso and has been implicated in zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso The body of the protein zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso is involved in contacts with the zzso zzso and other cells through interactions with zzso and zzso Finally, the tail of the protein zzso of the zzso zzso is engaged in interactions with zzso signaling zzso In many studies, zzso zzso has been correlated with disease, and zzso has been shown to promote tumor growth and progression in zzso On the other hand, protective effects of zzso in disease have also been zzso Future investigations should address the precise mechanisms of zzso in disease and biology in order to counterbalance the benefits from targeting zzso zzso with possible side zzso This review describes the biology of zzso its association with disease, and evaluates the possible approaches to targeting zzso in human zzso
