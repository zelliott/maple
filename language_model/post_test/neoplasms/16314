Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective but associated with short and long-term side zzso zzso side effects, including oral zzso zzso remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat zzso 

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for treating oral zzso or its associated pain in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or zzso 

zzso searches of Cochrane zzso Health Group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso lists from relevant articles were zzso Authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional zzso Date of most recent zzso May 2001 zzso 2001, issue 3) 

All zzso controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral zzso in people receiving chemotherapy and/or zzso Outcomes were oral zzso oral pain, zzso systemic infection, amount of zzso length of zzso cost and quality of zzso 

Data were independently zzso in zzso by two zzso Authors were contacted for details of zzso zzso and zzso Quality assessment was carried out on these three zzso Cochrane zzso Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and relative risk values calculated using fixed effects models as no significant zzso was detected zzso 

Fifteen trials involving 876 patients satisfied the inclusion zzso Two agents, each in single trials, were found to be effective for improving zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso vitamin E zzso zzso zzso to zzso The following agents were not found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso solution, zzso zzso and aluminum hydroxide zzso Three trials compared patient controlled analgesia zzso to the continuous infusion method for controlling zzso There was no evidence of a difference, however, less zzso was used per hour for zzso One trial demonstrated that zzso based analgesia zzso reduced pain compared with zzso however more zzso was used with zzso 

There is weak and unreliable evidence that zzso zzso and vitamin E improves or zzso zzso There is no evidence that patient controlled analgesia zzso is better than continuous infusion method for controlling pain, however, less zzso was used per hour for zzso Further, well zzso zzso trials assessing the effectiveness of zzso zzso vitamin E and new interventions for treating zzso are zzso
