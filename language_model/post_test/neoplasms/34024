It has become apparent that the clinical success anticipated in the field of gene therapy has been limited by progress in several of the fundamental areas of zzso molecular and cellular biology relevant to its zzso zzso a great deal of effort has been made in the evaluation of zzso it is only more recently with the advance of zzso systems that attention has begun to be focused upon the means and control of zzso zzso Until recently, the majority of zzso have employed ubiquitous viral promoters to drive expression from simple gene expression zzso using viral promoters and lacking zzso 3' untranslated regions zzso locus control regions zzso zzso attachment regions zzso and other such genetic zzso It has consequently emerged that these elements may have a key role in determining the levels and longevity of gene expression zzso in zzso irrespective of the zzso system zzso The majority of gene therapy applications would also benefit from the specific zzso of zzso expression zzso to zzso their therapeutic zzso In conjunction with modification of zzso zzso and strategies to limit their zzso this should create zzso suitable for the clinical application of gene zzso This review aims to highlight some of the principle considerations of gene expression in zzso and the means by which it may most effectively be zzso whether this is via the minimal modification of an existing zzso promoter or by the more extensive design of a novel promoter and associated zzso
