Compared to patients without cancer, patients with cancer receiving zzso treatment for zzso zzso are more likely to develop zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To compare the efficacy and safety of three types of zzso zzso low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the initial treatment of zzso in patients with zzso 

A comprehensive search for studies of zzso in cancer patients including a January 2007 electronic search of : Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso zzso and zzso the Web of zzso 

zzso clinical trials zzso comparing zzso zzso and zzso in patients with cancer and zzso confirmed zzso 

Using a standardized data form data was extracted in duplicate on zzso quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest that included all cause zzso zzso zzso major zzso minor zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Of zzso identified zzso 26 zzso including cancer patients as zzso fulfilled the inclusion zzso Cancer zzso data was obtained for 15 of the 26 zzso Thirteen studies compared a zzso to zzso while one study compared zzso to zzso and one study compared zzso to zzso zzso of 11 studies showed a statistically significant mortality reduction in patients treated with zzso compared with those treated with zzso zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso There was little change in the results after excluding studies of lower zzso quality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso A zzso of three studies comparing zzso with zzso in reducing zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso No data was available for bleeding zzso zzso or zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso showed a zzso significant benefit for the outcome of death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The one study comparing zzso to zzso showed a zzso significant mortality reduction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

Based on the included trials, zzso is likely to be superior to zzso in the initial treatment of zzso in patients with zzso However, there is a need for more trials to better address this research question in cancer zzso Moreover, researchers should consider making the raw data of zzso available for individual patient data zzso
