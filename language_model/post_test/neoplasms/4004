An attempt was made to study the zzso and zzso changes as well as zzso changes in zzso expression occurring in four types of clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso due to zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of cases studied were 16 cases, 15 cases, 4 cases and 5 cases zzso The study zzso zzso a combination of normal, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in different proportions in all the four groups having maximum number of zzso zzso in Group I and Group IV, relatively more number of zzso zzso in groups III and absence of zzso zzso in Group zzso zzso zzso zzso property in most of the zzso indicating zzso and zzso zzso in all the groups with zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso with zzso appear to be a good indicator for zzso zzso The zzso expression was week and irregular in most of the cases with most of the zzso probably due to reduction of zzso content probably indicating zzso zzso appear to be a good indicator for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed close resemblance with muscular zzso though no typical or distinct distinguishing feature could be identified in these four zzso
