Cancer and zzso cells recognize and migrate toward zzso zzso from zzso and use this mechanism to invade the zzso system, and cancer cells zzso through zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a key regulatory zzso in the switch to a zzso zzso in melanoma and breast cancer zzso However, it is not known whether zzso zzso is a potential therapeutic strategy for zzso of zzso Here, we describe an engineered zzso zzso zzso which zzso migration of zzso melanoma cells in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso allowed us to identify a naturally occurring human zinc finger protein with zzso zzso zzso Further analyses revealed a short zzso zzso zzso zzso with a predicted zzso structure, which is sufficient for association with zzso This zzso zzso zzso was then fused to the zzso region of human zzso to generate zzso a human zzso zzso fusion zzso Surface zzso resonance and zzso zzso showed that zzso binds zzso and zzso zzso migration of melanoma cells in zzso with zzso zzso In addition, zzso blocked migration of melanoma cells toward zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso Finally, zzso strongly reduced zzso invasion, zzso and zzso of zzso melanoma cells in zzso Together, these results show that zzso zzso zzso by zzso is a potential therapeutic strategy for zzso and provide further support for the hypothesis that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso
