We have studied the relationship between zzso zzso organizer region zzso distribution and zzso size in cancer cells at zzso zzso Thirteen cases of zzso zzso cancer and zzso cases of zzso zzso of different origin were zzso zzso of the former cases were stained by zzso B and of the latter by zzso zzso Selective zzso of zzso zzso was obtained by carrying out the zzso silver zzso reaction for zzso proteins zzso et zzso zzso The area occupied by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was measured by means of an automated image zzso Both in zzso zzso and in the other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso areas were zzso related zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso The close relationship between the area of zzso and that of zzso zzso structures was maintained even if the zzso procedure was prolonged beyond the optimal time length for selective zzso zzso zzso In the latter case, however, single zzso zzso were no longer visible within the zzso body which was, in fact, zzso zzso These data indicate that evaluation of the zzso zzso area has the same zzso in zzso pathology, as whole zzso size zzso
