zzso receptors for zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso and other peptides are found on various zzso We review the development of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso releasing zzso zzso designed for targeting chemotherapy to zzso receptors on various zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso respectively, target zzso receptors and may be used for the treatment of zzso and urinary zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso have also been incorporated into the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which are targeted to receptors for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and lung zzso They are found to suppress the growth of these tumors and their zzso A zzso analog of zzso zzso containing zzso has also been zzso and shown to inhibit growth of various human cancer lines expressing receptors for zzso The zzso zzso and maximum tolerated doses of zzso were assessed in a phase I clinical trial in women with zzso or zzso zzso Disease stabilization and objective responses were zzso zzso zzso is now in phase II clinical zzso Phase zzso studies with zzso in men with zzso relapsed prostate cancer and patients with pancreatic and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could provide a more zzso and less toxic therapy for various zzso
