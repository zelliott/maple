Although numerous studies suggest that there is an inverse relation between hospital volume of surgical procedures and surgical zzso the relative importance of hospital volume in various surgical procedures is zzso 

Using information from the national Medicare claims data base and the zzso zzso Sample, we examined the mortality associated with six different types of cardiovascular procedures and eight types of major cancer zzso between 1994 and 1999 zzso number of procedures, zzso zzso zzso techniques were used to describe relations between hospital volume zzso number of procedures performed per zzso and mortality zzso or within 30 zzso with adjustment for characteristics of the zzso 

zzso decreased as volume increased for all 14 types of procedures, but the relative importance of volume varied markedly according to the type of zzso Absolute differences in adjusted mortality rates between zzso hospitals and zzso hospitals ranged from over 12 percent (for pancreatic zzso zzso percent zzso zzso percent) to only zzso percent (for carotid zzso zzso percent zzso zzso zzso The absolute differences in adjusted mortality rates between zzso hospitals and zzso hospitals were greater than 5 percent for zzso and zzso 2 to 5 percent for zzso zzso repair of a zzso abdominal aneurysm, and replacement of an zzso or zzso zzso and less than 2 percent for zzso bypass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

In the absence of other information about the quality of surgery at the hospitals near them, Medicare patients undergoing selected cardiovascular or cancer procedures can significantly reduce their risk of operative death by selecting a high-volume zzso
