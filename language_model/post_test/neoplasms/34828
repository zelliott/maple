Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanism of zzso 3' end processing have uncovered a previously unanticipated integrated network of zzso and zzso zzso A variety of human diseases impressively reflect the importance of the precision of the complex 3' zzso machinery and gene specific deregulation of 3' end processing can result from zzso of zzso sequence elements that bind key specific processing zzso Interestingly, more general deregulation of 3' end processing can be caused either by zzso of these processing factors or by the zzso of the zzso equilibrium between these zzso From a medical perspective, both loss of function and gain of function can be functionally relevant, and an increasing number of different disease entities exemplifies that inappropriate 3' end formation of human zzso can have a tremendous impact on health and zzso Here, we review the zzso hallmarks of zzso 3' end processing, highlight the medical relevance of deregulation of this important step of zzso maturation and illustrate the implications for diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
