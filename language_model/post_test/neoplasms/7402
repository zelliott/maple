zzso and social losses are frequently reported in the zzso period of overt zzso The aim of this paper is to determine zzso in the life history of cancer patients, holding the hypothesis that early events could enhance stress produced by recent zzso a) It was found that between 1 to 14 years of age, zzso zzso of hospitalized cancer patients of both sexes zzso Age: Males zzso zzso zzso having different cancer diagnosis, mainly in advanced zzso which were selected for zzso assistance, had definitive parent losses with a statistically higher difference zzso less than zzso over healthy controls of people over 70 years old zzso Age: Males zzso zzso zzso with only zzso zzso Moreover, the same ratio was maintained in an additional sample of zzso zzso had parent loss in zzso Patients also showed higher rates of mother absence compared with zzso the latter having only zzso zzso while the former had 50% zzso b) More frequent and tragic losses were detected in patients life zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso c) It was found that zzso zzso of patients had affective losses in the period 5 years previous to the rise of cancer symptoms, that in fact could be related symbolically with early zzso zzso patients that showed losses of their couple in this zzso had definitive losses or disappointment of their parents in their zzso zzso In order to establish a effect of zzso upon the clinical course of cancer, the effect of deaths among other seriously ill patients in the same hospitalization Unit was zzso zzso analysis using the zzso test showed that 50% of deaths of 49 male patients occurred within one year, had a space of 5 days or less between them, differing statistically zzso less than zzso from a random distribution with deaths spaced zzso days, hence showing zzso instead of an homogeneous zzso It is zzso that losses during the zzso and clinical periods of cancer could operate as zzso zzso as they may relate psychologically to childhood zzso and/or a frequent and tragic losses zzso
