To characterize the aggressiveness of zzso cancer treatment for older adults on Medicare, and its relationship to the availability of zzso zzso 

We analyzed Medicare claims of zzso patients 65 years and older who died within 1 year of a diagnosis of zzso breast, zzso or other gastrointestinal cancer between 1993 and 1996 while living in one of 11 US regions monitored by the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso 

Rates of treatment with chemotherapy increased from zzso in 1993 to zzso in 1996 zzso zzso Among those who received chemotherapy, zzso were still receiving treatment within 2 weeks of death, increasing from zzso in 1993 to zzso in 1996 zzso zzso From 1993 to 1996, increasing proportions of patients had more than one emergency department visit zzso v zzso P zzso hospitalization zzso v zzso P zzso or were admitted to an intensive care unit zzso v zzso P zzso in the last month of zzso Although fewer patients died in acute-care hospitals zzso v zzso P zzso and more used hospice services zzso v zzso P zzso an increasing proportion of patients who received hospice care initiated this service only within the last 3 days of life zzso v zzso P zzso Black patients were more likely than white patients to experience aggressive intervention in zzso hospitals but not in teaching zzso Greater local availability of zzso was associated with less aggressive treatment near death on zzso zzso 

The treatment of cancer patients near death is becoming increasingly aggressive over zzso
