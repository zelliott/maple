zzso the first functionally identified zzso gene family member, plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation, cell zzso and cell zzso zzso is involved in the development and progression of zzso and is a potent target for cancer zzso One important zzso regulated by zzso is that involving two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso the zzso locus on which they are zzso A close correlation between the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso has been demonstrated in various zzso however, how zzso regulates zzso expression is not zzso In this study, we revealed that zzso regulates the expression of zzso by binding directly to the zzso element zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso resided at zzso zzso to zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso alone was sufficient to allow zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso typically functions by forming a complex with zzso however, regulation of zzso was independent of zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso DNA revealed that zzso genes were targeted by zzso including genes involved in zzso zzso cell cycle, and zzso By analyzing the binding sequences of these zzso we found two highly zzso zzso zzso which were required for zzso zzso promoter zzso Taken together, our results revealed the molecular mechanism of zzso regulation of the zzso zzso thus providing further insights into the functions of zzso as well as a sensitive zzso platform with which to screen zzso small molecules for cancer zzso
