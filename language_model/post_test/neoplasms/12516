zzso zzso cells zzso are currently under extensive evaluation as cell vaccines for cancer zzso The requirement for large-scale cell products demands zzso and standardized zzso However, the yield of zzso from zzso zzso is reported to be always lower than zzso In this present study we investigated whether this cell loss was caused by the properties of the starting population of zzso zzso zzso cells were enriched by zzso selection and analyzed for zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso of freshly isolated zzso from zzso coats of healthy donors underwent programmed cell zzso Further analysis of the fate of zzso cells during differentiation suggested zzso zzso were differentiated with zzso and zzso into a viable, zzso population of immature zzso zzso zzso of tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso resulted in fully matured zzso cells, which were evaluated by zzso analysis and by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso About zzso of the zzso zzso population differentiated to viable matured zzso zzso These results indicate that the yield of zzso cells is mainly influenced by the percentage of zzso cells in the zzso and this has implications for DC generation in clinical zzso
