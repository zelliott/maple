Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have brought a paradigm shift in how medical researchers investigate both rare and common human zzso The ability zzso to generate zzso sequencing data with deep coverage in a short time frame is replacing approaches that focus on specific regions for gene discovery and clinical zzso While whole zzso sequencing remains zzso expensive for most applications, zzso zzso technique which focuses on only the zzso portion of the zzso many advantages of the emerging technologies into zzso zzso Recent successes using this technology have uncovered genetic defects with a limited number of zzso regardless of shared genetic heritage, and are changing our approach to zzso disorders where soon all zzso zzso genes and their relation to zzso will be zzso The expectation is that, in the very near future, this technology will enable us to identify all the zzso in an zzso personal zzso and, in particular, clinically relevant zzso Beyond this, whole zzso sequencing is also expected to bring a major shift in clinical practice in terms of diagnosis and understanding of diseases, ultimately enabling zzso medicine based on one's zzso This paper provides an overview of the current and future use of next generation sequencing as it relates to whole zzso sequencing in human disease by focusing on the technical capabilities, limitations and ethical issues associated with this technology in the field of zzso and human zzso
