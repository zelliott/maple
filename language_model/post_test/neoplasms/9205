To determine mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso 

zzso zzso and protein expression were assessed in zzso randomly selected primary cancer tissue samples, matched zzso normal zzso and cell lines by use of real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with zzso The effect of zzso zzso on viability was assessed in selected cancer cell zzso zzso studies were performed to determine the zzso zzso required for binding to the zzso zzso for zzso activity, and for zzso 

In oral and lung zzso cell zzso zzso zzso levels corresponded with protein levels and zzso correlated with decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in a selective decrease in the viability of cancer cells with high zzso levels, suggesting the presence of zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso while maintaining zzso reaction zzso zzso involved in zzso and zzso protein zzso establishing it as a component of the zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso required the zzso of zzso zzso domain but not the nuclear zzso sequence zzso zzso In contrast, both the zzso domain and the zzso domain were required for transformation of zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso has zzso potential that requires its function as a component of the zzso zzso zzso activity and nuclear zzso of zzso are important for its in zzso zzso
