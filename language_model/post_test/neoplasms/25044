The workshop focused on approaches to deduce changes in biological activity in cellular pathways and networks that drive zzso from zzso zzso Work in cancer has demonstrated zzso that cancer zzso is driven not by single gene zzso or expression change, but by coordinated changes in multiple signaling zzso These zzso changes involve different genes in different individuals, leading to the failure of zzso analysis to identify the full range of zzso or expression changes driving cancer zzso There is also evidence that zzso pathways rather than individual genes play the critical role in a number of zzso zzso zzso to look at pathways and networks are needed to improve our understanding of disease and to improve our ability to target zzso at appropriate points in these zzso
