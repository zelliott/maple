This study evaluated the clinical relevance of the zzso strategy involving zzso and zzso zzso 

We investigated safety, zzso and correlations between tumor genetic zzso and clinical benefit in 236 patients with advanced zzso treated with phase I study drugs targeting zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso protein zzso zzso pathways in our Phase I Clinical Trials zzso 

zzso zzso patients received a zzso zzso inhibitor in combination with a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso whereas 124 zzso and 36 zzso respectively, received an inhibitor of either the zzso or zzso pathways zzso The rates of drug-related grade zzso adverse events were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso P zzso zzso the rates of zzso zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso P zzso zzso The most frequent grade zzso adverse events were zzso zzso skin zzso and zzso In our comprehensive tumor zzso analysis, of 9 patients who zzso zzso of both pathways zzso cancer, zzso zzso 7; melanoma, zzso zzso zzso all 5 patients treated with zzso had tumor zzso ranging from zzso to zzso 

These results suggest that dual zzso of both pathways may potentially exhibit favorable efficacy compared with zzso of either pathway, at the expense of greater zzso Furthermore, this parallel zzso targeting strategy may be especially important in patients with zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and suggests that molecular profiling and matching patients with combinations of these targeted drugs will need to be investigated in zzso
