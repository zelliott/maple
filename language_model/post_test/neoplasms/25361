zzso zzso zzso were isolated from 17 zzso and 7 solid zzso zzso zzso had defective natural killer zzso activity against zzso Large zzso zzso the zzso identified zzso of zzso activity, were poorly represented in zzso from zzso zzso as compared to peripheral blood zzso from the same patients or from normal zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso of zzso activity were identified with an zzso zzso zzso zzso When four zzso preparations were separated on zzso zzso zzso they were able to be enriched for zzso activity and large zzso zzso zzso in the lower density zzso as observed with zzso These observations suggested that a low concentration of the relevant zzso cells was the major factor determining the defective zzso zzso of zzso cells associated with these human zzso
