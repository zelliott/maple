As tumor cells zzso from the primary tumor location to a distant secondary site, they encounter an array of biologically and physically zzso zzso While it is well established that zzso signals guide all stages of the zzso zzso mounting evidence indicates that physical cues also direct tumor cell behavior, including zzso and migration zzso Physical cues acting on tumor cells in zzso include zzso zzso mechanical properties, zzso and topography, as well as zzso flow, zzso zzso zzso and local forces due to neighboring zzso zzso technologies have recently enabled us and other researchers to engineer cell zzso that mimic specific physical properties of the cellular zzso Through integration of these engineering strategies, along with physics, molecular biology, and imaging techniques, we have acquired new insights into tumor cell zzso and migration zzso In this review, we focus on the zzso and invasion stages of the zzso zzso We first discuss the physical role of the zzso during tumor cell zzso and invasion and how zzso of zzso and tumor cells contributes to the ability of tumor cells to exit the zzso Next, we examine how zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor cell zzso and migration beyond the zzso Finally, we zzso how tumor cells translate and respond to physical cues through zzso Because of the critical role of tumor cell zzso at various stages of the zzso zzso targeting signaling pathways involved in tumor cell zzso of physical stimuli may prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer zzso
