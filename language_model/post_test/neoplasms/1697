One of the major issues facing cancer zzso is that many human zzso zzso expression of zzso class I zzso The understanding of the mechanisms of zzso effects against tumors with zzso zzso class I will facilitate rational design of vaccines and zzso strategies to control such zzso A naked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso virus type 1 protein zzso linked to zzso zzso generated significant zzso effects against zzso and zzso zzso tumors with zzso zzso class I zzso Naked zzso zzso without the insert or an zzso vaccine also produced zzso effects against zzso zzso but not zzso Mice vaccinated with any of these naked zzso vaccines generated higher percentages of zzso zzso In zzso zzso depletion experiments revealed that zzso cells were important for the zzso effects of naked zzso vaccines against zzso zzso and that the zzso effects were zzso Poly zzso also increased the percentage of zzso cells and generated zzso effects against the tumors with zzso zzso class zzso Thus, the zzso naked zzso vaccine controls zzso class zzso and zzso class zzso tumor cells via different mechanisms, and zzso cells play an important role in the zzso effects generated by naked zzso zzso zzso
