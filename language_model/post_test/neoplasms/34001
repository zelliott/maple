From zzso to zzso of cancer patients treated with zzso zzso will develop symptomatic zzso Nevertheless, the underlying zzso is mostly zzso 

We investigated the influence of intravenous chemotherapy zzso on the diameter of the zzso artery using high resolution ultrasound in patients with zzso tumors, mostly gastrointestinal zzso zzso drugs included 30 cases with zzso and 30 cases with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, plasma levels of big zzso were assessed prior to and after zzso 

Fifteen of 30 patients zzso showed a contraction of the zzso artery after the end of zzso application zzso zzso range zzso whereas no single contraction was noticed in 30 patients following zzso zzso zzso zzso generally zzso within 30 zzso after stopping zzso Five patients positive for zzso associated vessel contraction were repeatedly exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of these zzso When patients with zzso zzso application were zzso with zzso no contraction of the zzso artery was detected in five out of five zzso There was a trend towards increased big zzso plasma levels after zzso application zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas big zzso levels remained unchanged after zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Application of zzso is commonly accompanied by zzso vessel zzso which is likely to represent the first step in zzso zzso zzso vessel zzso were highly zzso on zzso and were in the case of zzso application completely preventable by zzso
