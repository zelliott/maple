The zzso area is highly complex, and its complexity is increasing along with its growth and zzso Due to the zzso in genetic research, stem cell research and zzso medicine, zzso has become ever more important and plays a key role in biomedical zzso The zzso and the zzso of research results depend greatly on the quality and on the number of the samples used, and thus on the expertise of zzso having supplied these zzso Undoubtedly, the recognition of a research zzso depends on the impact of the research projects conducted with samples obtained from zzso zzso but also on many other zzso It thus seems important to determine a number of indicators within a zzso to estimate objective criteria for the performance of these zzso These indicators can allow to make some strategic decisions knowing that zzso are expensive structures to maintain in the present hospital zzso The use of these indicators could also contribute to the zzso of an zzso impact factor zzso or so called zzso research impact zzso zzso We describe here four major categories of indicators zzso activity, scientific production, zzso which seem to be useful for the evaluation of a zzso by making a proposition of allocation of zzso for the various considered zzso
