This study describes racial differences in zzso mortality following 8 cardiovascular and cancer procedures and zzso possible explanations for these zzso 

Although racial disparities in the use of surgical procedures are well established, relationships between race and operative mortality have not been assessed zzso 

We used national Medicare data to identify all patients undergoing one of 8 cardiovascular and cancer procedures between 1994 and zzso We used multiple zzso zzso to assess differences in operative mortality zzso within 30 days or before zzso between black patients and white patients, controlling for patient zzso Adding hospital indicators to these models, we then assessed the extent to which racial differences in operative mortality could be accounted for by the hospital in which patients were cared zzso 

Black patients had higher crude mortality rates than white patients for 7 of the 8 operations, including coronary artery zzso zzso valve replacement, abdominal zzso aneurysm repair, carotid zzso radical zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso Among these 7 procedures, odds ratios of mortality zzso versus zzso ranged from zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for zzso to zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso for zzso zzso for patient characteristics had modest or no effect on odds ratios of mortality by zzso However, there remained few clinically or statistically significant differences in mortality by race after we accounted for zzso zzso that treated a large proportion of black patients had higher mortality rates for all 8 procedures, for white as well as black zzso 

Black patients have higher operative mortality risks across a wide range of surgical procedures, in large part because of higher mortality rates at the hospitals they zzso
