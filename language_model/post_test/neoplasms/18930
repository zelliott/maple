zzso and fear are often associated with chronic conditions such as zzso This paper targets the zzso analysis of a zzso group therapy zzso in comparison to a zzso zzso group therapy zzso in cancer patients with dysfunctional fear of zzso An incremental zzso analysis was performed using data from a zzso controlled trial among cancer patients receiving zzso zzso The means, zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso incremental zzso graphic and zzso curve were obtained from 1,000 zzso zzso A total of 174 patients were included in the economic zzso The estimated means zzso zzso of direct costs and reduction of fear of progression were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for patients in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for patients in the zzso The incremental zzso ratio zzso zzso amounts to minus zzso zzso zzso for an additional unit of zzso Given the zzso curve, there is a zzso chance that the zzso compared with the zzso is cost-effective without the need of additional costs to zzso Our main result is the superior zzso of the zzso intervention program in comparison to the zzso encounter group for our sample of cancer patients with high levels of zzso
