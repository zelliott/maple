The most promising hypoxic cell zzso for use in zzso is, at present, the zzso zzso although zzso prevents its use at zzso necessary for optimum zzso In the search for agents with better therapeutic ratios, we have investigated several classes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In general, zzso derivatives are the most efficient in line with electron affinity zzso However, notable exceptions include some zzso zzso in the zzso by various zzso or zzso zzso Some of these compounds are as efficient as oxygen on a concentration basis and display activity greater than predicted from their electron zzso Cellular studies with these compounds will be zzso Further, in the zzso series the effect of the chain length of the zzso side chain terminated with a zzso zzso and zzso group has been zzso Notwithstanding the fairly constant electron affinities in these compounds, results show that systematic changes in zzso efficiency and zzso can occur with varying chain zzso which indicates possible potential for increasing therapeutic zzso These and other studies will be used as examples of the methods used in the search for better hypoxic cell zzso
