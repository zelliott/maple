The DNA in zzso zzso is zzso into various zzso by a series of zzso zzso onto the base of nuclear zzso zzso attachment regions zzso punctuate these attachment sites and govern the nuclear architecture by establishing zzso zzso In this context, specific proteins that interact with and bind to zzso sequences called zzso binding proteins zzso are of paramount importance, as these sequences zzso the proteins that regulate transcription, zzso repair and zzso Recent zzso also suggest a role for these zzso elements in viral integration, replication and transcription, thereby affecting host immune zzso zzso to the complex nature of these zzso zzso less is known about the zzso that bind to and bring about diverse effects on zzso architecture and gene zzso Several zzso have been identified and characterized so far and the list is zzso The fact that most the zzso exist in a zzso complex and bring about gene regulation makes them quintessential for cellular zzso This participation in gene regulation means that any zzso in the regulation and levels of zzso could lead to disease conditions, particularly those caused by abnormal cell zzso like zzso In the present chapter, we discuss the role of zzso and zzso in zzso gene regulation, zzso zzso and viral integration by altering the local zzso structure and their zzso in disease manifestation
