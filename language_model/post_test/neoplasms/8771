Nature has evolved DNA zzso zzso with different replication zzso with the purpose of maintaining and faithfully zzso the genetic zzso Besides the four classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells contain at least twelve specialized zzso whose functions have been discovered recently and are still not completely zzso Among them, zzso belonging to the Y family contribute to cell survival by promoting DNA damage zzso They are primarily involved in the zzso synthesis zzso pathway, incorporating zzso in an zzso or zzso manner, depending on the nature of the DNA zzso From an evolutionary point of view, their high zzso potential seems to guarantee the proper flexibility of vital importance for both adaptation to a zzso environment and evolution of the zzso These zzso are subjected to a complex network of regulation, since their uncontrolled access to DNA might promote zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of Y family is a hallmark of several tumor zzso In recent years, the unique structure and properties of Y family zzso have been exploited to design molecules that selectively interfere with the Pol of interest with minimal effect on normal zzso In addition, their distinctive properties have been applied to innovative techniques, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display and molecular zzso These approaches are based on zzso zzso provided with novel and ameliorated features and find applications in various fields, from biotechnology to zzso zzso and forensic zzso
