A significant fraction of the more than 18 million scientific articles currently zzso in the zzso database are related to immune responses to various agents, including infectious zzso zzso zzso transplants, cancer zzso and zzso The zzso zzso Database zzso is an online zzso that catalogs immune zzso zzso data derived from articles listed in the National Library of Medicine zzso zzso The zzso is maintained and continually updated by monitoring zzso for new, potentially relevant zzso 

zzso we detail the zzso of all zzso literature in over 100 different zzso zzso representing zzso Diseases and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The relative number of references in each category reflects past and present areas of research on immune zzso In addition to describing the overall landscape of data distribution, this particular characterization of the zzso reference data also allows for the exploration of possible correlations with global disease morbidity and mortality zzso 

While in most cases diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality rates were amongst the most zzso a number of high impact diseases such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to have very little zzso The data analyzed in this fashion represents the first estimate of how reported zzso data zzso to zzso morbidity and zzso and confirms significant discrepancies in the overall research zzso versus disease burden, thus identifying important gaps to be pursued by future zzso These findings may also provide a justification for zzso a portion of research funds into some of the zzso critical disease zzso
