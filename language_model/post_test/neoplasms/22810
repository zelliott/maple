A large number of zzso vaccine trials targeting a variety of zzso have been zzso however, the rate of reported clinically significant responses remains zzso zzso of DC to express tumor zzso or zzso molecules through the transfer of genes or zzso zzso offers a logical alternative with potential advantages over zzso or protein zzso zzso In this article, we review the current results and future prospects for genetically modified DC vaccines for the treatment of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso vaccines represent a powerful tool for cancer zzso Numerous zzso and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of zzso cell vaccines alone or in combination with other therapeutic zzso 

zzso modified zzso zzso vaccination holds promise, perhaps being best employed in the zzso setting with minimal residual disease after primary therapy, or in combination with other zzso or zzso zzso
