zzso aberrations that are associated with zzso growth factor zzso zzso activity are frequently found in zzso (10 - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso zzso studies have also identified zzso at lower frequency in common cancer zzso zzso evidence further suggests tumor zzso roles of zzso expressed by tumor zzso cells and indicates a deleterious effect of zzso zzso on zzso drug zzso 

This review summarizes the present understanding of zzso signaling in solid tumors based on experimental studies and clinical zzso It also provides a discussion of selected ongoing efforts to develop novel cancer therapies involving zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

An increased molecular understanding of response and resistance mechanisms will be essential for therapeutic advances in zzso cancer zzso Further developments rely on clinical studies where systematic analyses of target status in zzso cells and in cells of the tumor zzso are zzso Studies with combination therapies will be facilitated by selective zzso zzso with reduced side zzso Finally, development of improved companion zzso is of critical importance for patient selection and monitoring of therapeutic zzso
