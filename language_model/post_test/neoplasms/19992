zzso zzso zzso in mice is an efficient strategy to investigate the genetic mechanisms of zzso The identification of tumor driving zzso insertions traditionally requires the generation of large tumor zzso to obtain information about common zzso zzso zzso driving insertions are also characterized by their zzso expansion in tumor zzso a phenomenon that is facilitated by the slow and evolving transformation process of zzso zzso We describe here an improved approach for the detection of tumor driving insertions that zzso the zzso expansion of insertions by zzso the relative proportion of sequence reads obtained in individual zzso To this end, we have developed a protocol for zzso site sequencing that zzso acoustic zzso of tumor DNA and zzso zzso We analyzed various solid tumors generated by zzso zzso and for each tumor zzso reads corresponding to zzso zzso sites were zzso In each zzso 9 to 25 insertions stood out by their enriched sequence read zzso when compared to zzso obtained from tail DNA zzso These enriched insertions are potential zzso expanded tumor driving zzso and thus identify candidate cancer zzso The candidate cancer genes of our study comprised many established cancer zzso but also novel candidate genes such as zzso zzso and zzso delta zzso We show that zzso expansion analysis by zzso sequencing is a robust approach for the identification of candidate cancer genes in zzso zzso screens on the level of individual zzso
