There is considerable evidence that brief group zzso programs for cancer patients, offering support and some training in coping skills, may have lasting beneficial effects on mood and quality of zzso 

To compare two different formats of a brief, group zzso program for cancer zzso a standard format of six weekly two-hour sessions or a zzso zzso involving the same content and contact time compressed into two zzso 

Cancer patients were randomly assigned to either the standard weekly intervention zzso zzso zzso or the weekend program zzso zzso zzso Two assessment measures were zzso Profile of zzso States zzso and zzso Living Index for Cancer zzso zzso were made before and after each intervention and at a zzso zzso 

While the two formats were found to be equivalent in their overall effects on mood and quality of life, there were some zzso There was a sudden, large improvement in mood by the end of the weekend version of the course zzso time zzso but this did not persist, and by the zzso point and again at zzso mood improvement was the same for both zzso Quality of life improvement seemed to be marginally greater with the zzso sessions zzso statistical significance at the zzso zzso 

The two formats produced similar improvements in both mood and quality of zzso We discuss the need for further studies to find optimal ways of presenting such help for different patient zzso
