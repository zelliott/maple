The discovery that zzso a small zzso zzso is involved in zzso opens a new scenario to overcome the drug resistance in zzso It was shown that zzso can efficiently inhibit the expression of zzso in cancer zzso However, the clinical use of zzso is still hampered by an zzso zzso zzso To address this problem, earlier we developed a novel system to deliver zzso into cancer zzso zzso we zzso modified the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso portion via a zzso zzso bond and incorporated the resulting zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtaining zzso zzso zzso The activity of these zzso was evaluated by zzso protein zzso tumor cell growth zzso and zzso of the treated tumor cells to zzso zzso We found a significant decrease of cell viability and zzso of zzso protein levels after treatment with zzso zzso PM in several cancer cell zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso by treating cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso a significant zzso of the cells to zzso in both sensitive and resistant cancer cell zzso Finally, we demonstrated successful zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the same PM leading to superior therapeutic activity compared to their sequential zzso Our results support the use of this new platform for the treatment of the most aggressive zzso
