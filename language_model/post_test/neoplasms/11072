Some patients needing a kidney transplant have used zzso before the zzso zzso bone zzso damage associated with zzso could manifest with zzso complications after transplant in the context of the zzso but evidence for this has not been zzso 

We performed a retrospective, zzso analysis of zzso transplant recipients with prior zzso exposure and compared zzso short-term outcomes to a random control group zzso outcomes identified by searching automated electronic zzso 

Sixteen recipients had taken zzso before the transplant and were compared with a control group of 32 zzso zzso rates were equal, and although there were 3 times more zzso secondary to an zzso course in the zzso group, this did not achieve significance zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso There was no difference in rates of zzso zzso or zzso The zzso group was at significantly greater risk of needing a blood zzso immediately after the transplant zzso number of units of blood per patient, zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso Also, they were 3 times more likely to require anemia treatments 1 year after the transplant zzso number of anemia treatment medications, zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso Full blood count zzso graft function, and graft and patient survival at 1 year zzso were zzso 

Evidence suggests that zzso administration of zzso is associated with adverse short-term outcomes zzso Further analyses are warranted to investigate these preliminary findings to determine whether zzso zzso should be modified in the context of prior zzso zzso
