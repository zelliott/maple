A stable and efficient contrast agent is highly desirable for zzso zzso imaging zzso Recently gold zzso have been widely reported and studied for PA imaging and zzso zzso However, the structures of the zzso gold zzso are easily destroyed after laser zzso and thus may fail to complete the intended zzso In this study, we propose to apply palladium zzso zzso with strong optical zzso in the zzso zzso region, as a new class of zzso PA contrast zzso PA and ultrasound zzso images were acquired zzso by a portable and fast zzso zzso zzso system with a hand-held zzso zzso and long-lasting imaging enhancement in zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso was successfully observed in mice by zzso over time after tail vein administration of zzso The zzso and functional zzso of the tumors were delineated in PA images due to the zzso zzso zzso of the main zzso was also conducted ex zzso to trace the fate of zzso which was further validated by zzso coupled plasma atomic zzso zzso zzso No obvious toxic effect was observed by in zzso zzso zzso and ex zzso zzso examination 7 days after zzso zzso With the combination of a portable imaging instrument and signal zzso zzso might be applied as stable and effective agents for zzso cancer zzso diagnosis and treatment zzso
