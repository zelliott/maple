The numbers of strongly adherent zzso in the peripheral blood of normal subjects and cancer patients were zzso The method used was to place peripheral blood zzso cells in zzso and culture them for 1 zzso At the end of that period, adherent zzso were counted in the Coulter counter after zzso zzso cells per zzso of blood, per total cells, and per zzso cells or zzso zzso were markedly diminished in the peripheral blood zzso cells of 44 melanoma, 23 breast cancer, 18 lung cancer, nine colon cancer, and 27 leukemia zzso Median values were zzso X zzso adherent cells per zzso peripheral blood for 86 normal subjects, as against zzso X zzso per zzso in the peripheral blood of the 125 patients zzso less than zzso There was a poor correlation between the adherent cell numbers and the peripheral blood zzso counts, but an excellent correlation of the different adherent cell counts with each zzso The number of adherent cells in the peripheral blood varied zzso with age in the cancer patients, but not in the normal subjects zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso When patients under age 50 were compared to the controls, the zzso of adherent cells was slightly more severe in patients with stage IV lung cancer than in those with stage III lung zzso In contrast, there was no difference in the degree of zzso between patients with stage III melanoma and no evident disease and patients with stage IV zzso zzso zzso The implications of these results are zzso
