The zzso factor zzso plays a crucial role in governing cell proliferation through manipulation of the expression of many genes required for cell cycle zzso As studies are exploring in depth, zzso has grown into a zzso family and has been required for the regulation of a large number of genes involved in various cellular zzso The expanding zzso membership and biological function provide us some new insights relating to the evolution of zzso One of them is to understand the exact mechanisms by which zzso zzso in these different cellular processes during zzso This review summarizes recent advances in this field, with an emphasis on a notion that zzso acts as a molecular switch in the control of both normal cell and tumor zzso
