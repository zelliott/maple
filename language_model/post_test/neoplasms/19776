zzso of depression are useful to evaluate depression interventions offered to patients with chronic zzso zzso The only zzso system to describe depression developed specifically for valuation purposes is the zzso but it has not been used among zzso zzso The aim of this study was to test the construct zzso of the zzso among diabetes and cancer patients and then to compare the zzso to the commonly used zzso - 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso The comparison was expected to shed light on their capacity to reflect the range of depression states experienced by zzso zzso 

zzso data were collected online from 114 diabetes and 195 cancer zzso zzso zzso cancer patients completed part of the survey on zzso zzso analyses were performed to test the construct zzso Specifically, we hypothesized high correlations of the zzso zzso with depression zzso for zzso Studies Depression zzso zzso and the Patient Health zzso zzso We also expected zzso correlations with self-esteem zzso zzso scale - zzso and zzso zzso Personality zzso zzso scale - zzso Multiple linear zzso analyses were run so that the proportion of zzso in depression scores zzso zzso explained by the zzso could be compared to the proportion explained by the zzso zzso zzso 

As expected, among all patients groups, we found moderate to high correlations for the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso to zzso we also found low to moderate correlations with the zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso to zzso Linear zzso analyses showed that the zzso explained a greater proportion of zzso in depression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso support the construct zzso of the zzso among patients with zzso conditions and demonstrate that it performs better than the zzso zzso system to reflect the range of depression zzso For future valuation purposes, the zzso zzso system could therefore be recommended to describe depression as experienced by patients with a chronic medical zzso
