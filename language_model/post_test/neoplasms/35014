In an effort to make zzso killer cell zzso therapy safer for cancer patients, we examined the efficacy of using zzso zzso bags as tissue culture zzso These bags can be zzso connected using tubing kits thus reducing the risk of contamination to the zzso zzso blood zzso cells were obtained from normal donors or cancer patients undergoing zzso cell zzso Following zzso zzso these cells were incubated in the presence of zzso in either zzso plastic bags or standard tissue culture zzso Our results showed that zzso cells could be generated from either normal donors or cancer patients in the bags as well as in the zzso Comparisons were made of the zzso cell populations obtained from the two sources and showed that each was similar in terms of zzso as determined by Wright stain zzso The populations of cells were also similar in regard to cell surface zzso as determined by flow zzso zzso In addition, zzso from either tissue culture vessel as well as cell viability of the zzso cells were zzso Finally, the zzso cells obtained from both sources were assessed for zzso activity against the tumor cell lines zzso and zzso These results showed that the zzso activity of the zzso cells against these target cells was the same whether the cells were obtained from the zzso or the zzso
