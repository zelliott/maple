Achieving zzso tumor targeting after systemic delivery is a considerable challenge facing zzso gene zzso zzso zzso should be combined with efforts to improve in zzso safety, reduce zzso minimize zzso zzso and improve zzso potency and zzso We previously described the successful zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso to zzso an zzso that is highly zzso in numerous human zzso In this study, we have further modified this construct by introducing zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and putative interactions with factor IX zzso protein zzso We have found that the resulting zzso zzso displays a desirable in zzso safety zzso This zzso does not zzso human zzso fails to cause zzso after intravenous delivery, has limited induction of zzso zzso and results in low-level toxicity zzso zzso zzso when compared with zzso Furthermore, it has reduced zzso in zzso cells zzso and limited zzso zzso at later time points (24 and zzso The parental zzso zzso also displayed many of these desirable zzso As a result of the improved safety profile of both zzso zzso we escalated the dose from zzso to zzso viral particles in an zzso efficacy zzso We observed improvements in reducing percent tumor growth at early time points zzso when compared with zzso although increasing the dose did not affect the therapeutic outcome zzso On completion of the experiment, we detected increased zzso zzso in the tumors of all zzso groups and we determined that zzso expression was localized largely within zzso tumor zzso However, in spite of apparently efficient tumor zzso this did not result in enhanced zzso efficacy as the virus failed to zzso effectively throughout the tumor mass, presumably due to physical zzso zzso This highlights a remaining challenge that needs to be overcome before such zzso can be developed for future cancer gene therapy zzso
