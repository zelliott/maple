This study was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of administering zzso zzso zzso as a one-hour intravenous zzso infusion on day 1 combined with zzso zzso as a zzso zzso injection for five zzso zzso or three zzso zzso consecutive days every four zzso 

zzso patients with advanced solid zzso were treated with 115 total courses involving seven dose levels of the two regimens of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In an effort to reduce fluid retention and hypersensitivity phenomena related to zzso patients received zzso with zzso 8 zzso orally twice daily for three consecutive days beginning 24 hours before zzso 

Severe zzso 4) zzso lasting longer than seven days with or without fever and/or severe zzso precluded further dose escalation above zzso 60 zzso on day 1 and zzso 300 zzso administered on days zzso every four zzso The rates of these toxic effects were also unacceptably high above zzso 60 zzso on day 1 and zzso 300 zzso administered on days 1-3 every four zzso Nine patients experienced various manifestations of zzso that were potentially related to study zzso However, neither treatment delay nor zzso of treatment was zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatigue, were mild to modest in severity and occurred infrequently zzso zzso of zzso Two patients with zzso breast cancer experienced complete responses and a partial response occurred in a patient with zzso zzso lung zzso 

Based on the results of this study, the regimen of zzso 60 zzso on day 1 followed by zzso 300 zzso zzso for three or five days every four weeks is well tolerated and these doses are recommended for further zzso The feasibility of administering zzso 60 zzso followed by zzso 300 zzso for three or five days every four weeks and the preliminary zzso activity noted indicate that further zzso studies of zzso and zzso are warranted in patients with relevant solid zzso
