In 2005, 8 Imaging Response Assessment Teams zzso were zzso by the National Cancer Institute zzso as supplemental grants to existing zzso Cancer zzso After discussion among the zzso regarding the need for increased zzso of clinical and research zzso methodology, it became apparent that data acquisition and processing approaches differ considerably among zzso To determine the zzso in detail, a survey of zzso sites and zzso affiliates was zzso 

A zzso instrument evaluating patient preparation, scanner type, performance approach, display, and analysis was zzso Fifteen institutions, including the 8 original zzso and 7 institutions that had developed affiliate zzso were zzso 

The major areas of variation were zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso time zzso zzso sedation zzso to zzso handling of diabetic patients, imaging time zzso zzso zzso performance of diagnostic CT scans as a part of zzso type of acquisition zzso zzso zzso CT technique, duration of zzso (4 or 6 zzso and zzso zzso zzso processing, display, and zzso zzso 4 sites stating that zzso images appear on zzso 

There is considerable zzso in the way zzso scans are performed at academic institutions that are part of the zzso zzso This zzso likely makes it difficult to zzso compare studies performed at different zzso These data suggest that additional zzso in methodology will be required so that zzso studies, especially those performed zzso are more comparable across zzso
