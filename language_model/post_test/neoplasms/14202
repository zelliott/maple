A pilot study was carried out to investigate the performance of ultrasound zzso imaging methods namely zzso zzso Imaging zzso and zzso zzso Force zzso zzso zzso zzso their potential for characterizing different classes of solid mass zzso was analyzed using zzso based tissue mimicking zzso Composite tissue mimicking phantom was prepared with embedded inclusions of varying zzso from 50 zzso to 450 zzso to represent different stages of zzso zzso properties such as sound speed, zzso zzso and acoustic zzso were characterized by pulse echo ultrasound test at 5 zzso frequency and they are ranged from zzso zzso 88 to zzso zzso 124 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The elastic property Young's zzso of the prepared samples was measured by conducting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test under a strain rate of zzso zzso 10 % strain, and the values are from 50 zzso to 450 zzso for a variation of zzso concentration from zzso to zzso by zzso The composite zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso machine using linear array zzso zzso at 8 zzso zzso strain and displacement images were collected by zzso and zzso zzso wave zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also measured for high zzso contrast (18 zzso inclusion and zzso zzso was found for all other zzso The images were zzso processed and parameters such as zzso Transfer Efficiency and lateral image profile were zzso and zzso The results indicate that both zzso and zzso represent the abnormalities better than conventional US B mode imaging whereas zzso enhances the underlying zzso contrast into improved strain zzso The results are zzso with literature and also with clinical patient zzso
