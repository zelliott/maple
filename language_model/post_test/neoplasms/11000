Several zzso signatures predict survival in diffuse large zzso zzso zzso but the lack of practical methods for zzso analysis has limited translation to clinical zzso We built and validated a simple model using one gene expressed by tumor cells and another expressed by host immune cells, assessing added zzso value to the clinical International zzso Index zzso zzso domain only 2 zzso was validated as an independent predictor of survival and the zzso center B zzso zzso zzso of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso member 9 zzso from the zzso zzso was the best gene in zzso combination with zzso Study of zzso tissue expression in 95 patients with zzso showed expression limited to zzso T zzso A model zzso these 2 genes was independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and added to the zzso power of the zzso A composite score zzso these genes with zzso performed well in 3 independent zzso of zzso zzso patients, as well as in a simple zzso of routine zzso specimens from a new validation cohort of 147 patients with zzso We conclude that the measurement of a single gene expressed by tumor cells zzso and a single gene expressed by the immune zzso zzso powerfully predicts overall survival in patients with zzso
