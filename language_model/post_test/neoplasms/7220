A variety of solid and zzso human tumors and normal human bone zzso specimens were zzso for colony formation in a short-term zzso culture zzso The effect of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso of colony formation was zzso The effect of zzso on colony formation formed a zzso from complete zzso to stimulation of zzso Of 40 zzso tumor zzso 18 showed at least a zzso zzso of colony formation in the presence of zzso at zzso of 1000 zzso or zzso Four specimens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed at least zzso stimulation of colony formation with zzso Two of 12 normal bone zzso specimens grown with zzso zzso media showed greater than zzso colony zzso with zzso A zzso relationship was seen in all tumor specimens zzso While zzso zzso was the most active in this system, all zzso showed the same magnitude and direction of zzso Continuous exposure and zzso incubation of tumor cells with zzso were identical in terms of colony zzso These data support the ability of this zzso system to select tumors responsive in zzso to zzso suggest the optimal species and concentration for zzso or stimulation of growth, and support a direct role of zzso in the regulation of cell growth independent of other zzso actions of zzso Such information may prove useful for predicting response in zzso to zzso in Phase II zzso
