A method based on combining zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or an zzso step was developed to study the zzso of the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso drug under in zzso zzso zzso The formation of a zzso zzso species in the cell, following the metal release from the zzso is thought to play an important role in the drug's mode of zzso zzso and zzso acid at their cancer zzso zzso were shown to be capable of altering the metal zzso in the drug zzso with zzso but not that with zzso The appearance of the additional zzso in zzso zzso (by recording both zzso and zzso zzso was found to be dependent on time which allowed for kinetic assessment of the evolution of novel metal zzso On the contrary, after the addition of zzso acid the zzso zzso zzso the appropriately zzso zzso remained zzso in the zzso This was zzso as a proof of the zzso changes taking place by a virtue of a zzso mechanism rather than due to zzso zzso The zzso zzso was further characterized by direct zzso zzso so as to confirm a partial release of zzso induced by zzso
