Few studies have considered the potential utility of clothing size as a predictor of diseases associated with body zzso 

We used data on zzso men and women from a zzso of the Netherlands zzso Study to assess the correlation of clothing size with other zzso zzso Cox zzso using the zzso approach was performed to establish whether clothing size can predict cancer risk after zzso years of zzso and if additionally considering body mass index zzso in the model improves the zzso 

zzso and skirt size correlated well with circumference zzso zzso size predicted zzso cancer risk, and this effect was slightly attenuated when zzso was added to the zzso zzso size predicted risk of zzso cell zzso regardless of whether zzso was in the zzso 

Clothing size appears to predict cancer risk independently of zzso suggesting that clothing size is a useful measure to consider in zzso studies when waist circumference is not zzso
