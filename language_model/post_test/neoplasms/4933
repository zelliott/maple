Using zzso zzso update December zzso we identified English language studies that examined associations between zzso and cancer prognosis using tumor specimens for more than 10 patients during zzso zzso We included studies that assessed a major clinical outcome zzso disease, disease zzso response to therapy, zzso zzso or overall zzso in an agnostic fashion using either zzso chain reaction or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso articles presenting results on 43 studies pertaining to 20 different types of zzso were eligible for inclusion in this zzso The median study size was 65 patients zzso range zzso zzso zzso the median number of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and overall survival or recurrence were the most commonly measured outcomes (30 and 19 studies, zzso External validation was performed in 21 studies, 20 of which reported at least one zzso statistically significant result for a zzso zzso The median hazard ratio for poor outcome in zzso validated studies was zzso zzso zzso zzso For all zzso zzso in studies that evaluated overall survival across diverse zzso the zzso most frequently associated with poor outcome after accounting for differences in zzso assessment due to platform type were zzso zzso expression in patients with zzso and zzso 21 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso show promising zzso associations with major cancer outcomes and specific zzso are consistently identified across diverse studies and zzso These types of zzso require careful external validation in large groups of cancer patients that have adequate protection from zzso -
