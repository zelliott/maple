zzso release of acid zzso zzso activity by zzso and zzso zzso cells was studied in zzso chemically defined media zzso in zzso zzso isolated from urinary zzso of male zzso and zzso of zzso rats each showed preferential zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity within 30 zzso after exposure to zzso zzso (5 X zzso zzso or to zzso zzso 1 X zzso zzso zzso In contrast, release of such zzso and stimulation of cell proliferation were far less extensive in rat zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso of CB was characteristic of zzso but not zzso zzso cells from human zzso zzso cells with divergent rates of zzso zzso were separated by a zzso zzso Those cells with high rates of zzso zzso also exhibited higher rates of cell proliferation in zzso as well as in soft gels, and a greater level of CB release than corresponding cancer cells with a relatively low degree of zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cervical zzso cells with zzso containing zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of CB activity, zzso a sharp reduction in both cellular zzso zzso activity and cell growth as compared to appropriate zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso CB activity in zzso and zzso cells may play a significant role in the promotion of cell zzso
