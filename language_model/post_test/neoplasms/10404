zzso number of publications in the last 10 years implicated that cancer development zzso except genetic zzso also on zzso gene expression patterns that are not bound to DNA sequence zzso These zzso mechanisms manifest mostly through changes in zzso packing and in localized gene promoter changes that influence the zzso of the genes involved in zzso These changes are zzso zzso and potentially zzso providing large possibilities of zzso therapy of zzso So far this therapy lacks specificity of targeting certain zzso Instead, zzso therapy attempts either to reactivate or to silence genes that are important for the cancer zzso zzso therapy of cancer is based mostly on the usage of zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that involve integration of the latest technological advances, such as whole zzso zzso expression zzso help identify mechanisms of action of zzso drugs, leading to development of second generation of zzso which would have greater specificity and zzso The obtained results are promising, leaving great possibilities for improvement of cancer zzso
