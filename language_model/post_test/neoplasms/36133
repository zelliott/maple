Cancer is a genetically and clinically diverse disease, and the therapeutic strategies should be zzso for individual zzso Recent advances in zzso have generated molecular targeting zzso drugs, and their zzso uses are an emergent zzso zzso are key tools to assess the zzso potential of tumor cells and to establish zzso zzso The zzso is a functional translation of the zzso and it directly regulates the zzso zzso of tumor zzso thus, a zzso approach could make significant contributions to zzso zzso In the past decade, zzso technologies have progressed zzso and zzso to predict the response to treatments were developed using clinical materials in various types of zzso For example, zzso identified a strong zzso candidate, zzso as a novel zzso zzso in gastrointestinal zzso zzso where the zzso drug became available to reduce the risk of zzso zzso The zzso utility of zzso was zzso established by zzso validation studies, and we expect that in the near future we will be able to select patients who may need zzso therapy by measuring the expression of zzso in surgical zzso These observations suggested the utility of zzso for zzso zzso Other than the application of advanced technologies, the key points in zzso studies are the use of an adequate number of clinical materials with zzso experimental zzso zzso between basic researchers and clinicians are critical for the effective approach towards realistic zzso by zzso
