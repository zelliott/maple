Conventional wisdom has long held that once a cancer cell has developed it will inevitably progress to clinical zzso zzso this zzso it has more recently become apparent that the tumor interacts with its zzso and that some environmental zzso such as the zzso switch, must be overcome for the tumor to zzso In zzso attraction has been drawn to the concept that there is a minority population of cells - the cancer stem cells - bestowed with the exclusive ability to zzso and zzso the zzso With therapeutic targeting issues at stake, much attention has shifted to the identification of cancer stem cells, the thinking being that the remaining zzso population, already zzso to die, will play a negligible role in tumor zzso In fact, the newly appreciated importance of zzso interactions in cancer development also extends in a unique and unexpected way to interactions between the stem and zzso compartments of the zzso Here we discuss recent findings drawn from a hybrid zzso zzso model that simulates growth of a zzso solid tumor comprised of cancer stem cells and zzso cancer zzso The model shows how the introduction of cell fate zzso paradoxically influences the tumor growth dynamic in response to zzso to reveal yet another bottleneck to tumor progression potentially zzso for disease zzso
