Liver zzso is a zzso pathology characterized by the zzso zzso and deposition of zzso proteins and zzso of zzso which increase the zzso and zzso of this zzso Since recent studies have shown that zzso preceded the generation of zzso zzso we zzso that liver zzso could play a role as a mechanism for restricting uncontrolled cell zzso inducing the mortality of cancer cells and subsequent development of primary zzso With this purpose, in this work we zzso in zzso how the zzso of zzso can influence zzso viability and zzso of zzso cells zzso embedded in zzso zzso mimicking values of elasticity of zzso liver zzso zzso were performed by zzso up to 10 zzso cells within zzso made of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which, besides having values of elasticity from the zzso to the zzso range liver zzso lacked zzso for zzso mimicking the zzso existing in zzso primary zzso Our results show that zzso cells exhibited a short zzso phase followed by an irreversible zzso stage, in which cell mortality could be zzso by two zzso mechanical stress, in the case of cells zzso in a stiffer zzso and mass transfer limitations produced by pore zzso at the interface zzso in zzso zzso According to the zzso knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to zzso the role of liver zzso during zzso zzso suggesting that the generation of a zzso and mechanically zzso environment surrounding cancer cells could control the zzso migration of zzso cells and the subsequent development of primary zzso
