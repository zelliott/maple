The free zzso of human zzso zzso zzso is well zzso as a product of many zzso zzso Recently, it has been shown that this zzso production may have a functional relationship to zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso may be explained by its structural similarity to a family of growth factors which all contain the same distinct zzso fold known as the zzso zzso Since the other members of this family all exhibit their activities as zzso and zzso it is possible that the same may be true for zzso Using zzso zzso low stringency zzso and zzso assisted laser zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso we have shown that pure preparations of zzso contain zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso profiles with a forward peak corresponding to the zzso characteristic of a zzso protein with an approximate mass of zzso zzso and a late shoulder centered around an zzso position expected for a zzso protein of approximately 29 zzso Two zzso zzso species, of approximately 32 and 64 zzso were clearly resolved by zzso and Western zzso When zzso by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso is consistent with the zzso of other zzso growth factors and strengthens the inclusion of the zzso hormones within this zzso It has yet to be determined whether it is this zzso molecular species that is responsible for zzso activity of zzso preparations in zzso
