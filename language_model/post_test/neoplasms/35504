zzso had been considered to be the only class of the zzso proteins capable of gap junction zzso however, new candidates for this function with no zzso to zzso termed zzso were zzso So far three zzso were described in zzso and human zzso zzso zzso and zzso Expressions of zzso can be detected in numerous brain structures, and now found both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso roles of zzso in the nervous system include participating in sensory processing, zzso zzso synchronization between zzso and cortex, and propagation of the calcium waves supported by zzso cells, which help maintain and zzso zzso zzso zzso also may participate in pathological reactions of the neural cells, including their damage after zzso and subsequent cell zzso Recent study revealed zzso junction function of zzso zzso in zzso where they serve as the zzso for the zzso release in response to the zzso zzso zzso studies produced some zzso of the zzso involvement in the process of zzso According to brain cancer gene expression database zzso zzso expression levels can predict post diagnosis survival for patients with zzso zzso Further investigations are needed to verify or reject hypotheses zzso
