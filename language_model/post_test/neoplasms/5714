zzso nutrients have been hypothesized to be protective against zzso Vitamin C is a major circulating zzso zzso and vitamin E is a major zzso zzso Many zzso and cohort studies have related cancer risk to estimates of zzso intake derived from food intake zzso zzso high in fruit and vegetables, and hence high in vitamin C, have been found to be associated with lower risk for zzso of the oral zzso zzso stomach, zzso and zzso zzso high in added vegetable zzso and hence high in vitamin zzso have been less consistently shown to be associated with cancer zzso This may be because vitamin E offers less protection against cancer or because the zzso of vitamin E intake is less accurate than is the zzso of vitamin C zzso In contrast with the findings from zzso studies based on foods, zzso studies of nutrients consumed in supplements and recent experimental trials provide little support for a strong protective role for vitamins C or E against zzso If vitamins C or E are indeed protective against cancer, that protection may derive from their consumption in complex zzso with other nutrients and with other zzso compounds as found in the zzso provided by whole zzso
