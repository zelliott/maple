The zzso therapeutic zzso and its derivatives act as potent zzso agents via a combined mechanism involving cell cycle arrest and induction of zzso Cell death induced by zzso has been shown to engage a zzso pathway, cell cycle arrest, interaction with several zzso and induction of the zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso Cell cycle arrest was shown to result from DNA damage caused by a variety of tumor zzso zzso this is also the case for zzso The prevalent zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso are zzso zzso into DNA, zzso zzso of DNA zzso II activity, and zzso zzso binding to DNA in zzso and in zzso after zzso zzso by zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso The mechanism leading to zzso by zzso is thought to also be associated with DNA damage, by zzso of zzso II and the zzso modification of zzso In addition, the formation of zzso zzso ultimately can mutate cancer cells or initiate cell zzso The aim of this review is to zzso our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms with the aim to explain the effectiveness of zzso as zzso zzso in cancer zzso
