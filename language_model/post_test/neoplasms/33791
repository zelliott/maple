We investigated the zzso of fresh human solid tumor cells by peripheral blood T zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of certain zzso zzso A, zzso or zzso directly into the zzso zzso zzso caused significant zzso of zzso less than zzso zzso solid tumor targets by enriched populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso at least less than zzso of Con A- or zzso solid tumor zzso by zzso zzso were observed in 32 of 39 donors zzso and 14 of 20 donors zzso zzso In contrast, the addition of other zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso did not cause zzso The levels of Con zzso zzso were comparable to those of zzso 2 zzso zzso by zzso zzso natural killer zzso zzso The presence of zzso at the zzso phase, but not of zzso zzso zzso was required for the zzso of solid tumor zzso Both Con zzso and zzso zzso were totally inhibited by treatment of the zzso cells with the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells responsible for Con zzso zzso of solid tumors expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 7 zzso but lacked T4 zzso and zzso 11 zzso zzso as determined by both negative and positive cell selection zzso Con zzso zzso was inhibited at the zzso phase by zzso zzso or zzso 4) or zzso zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso that these zzso cells may contain a population of zzso T cells zzso generated in zzso against zzso modified cells that can lyse fresh solid tumor target cells under conditions where the recognition requirements for the zzso are zzso by zzso zzso
