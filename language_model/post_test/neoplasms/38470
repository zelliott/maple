We have identified and zzso a tumor protein complex, zzso on zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the two zzso zzso recognizes a zzso protein complex on several human zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been used to purify the human zzso complex from zzso cells and the zzso material used to zzso zzso rats to produce another zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso This zzso does not zzso the zzso zzso or bind to zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso the same proteins from zzso cells but did not compete with each other for binding sites, indicating that they recognize different zzso on the same zzso The two zzso have been used in a zzso zzso to zzso zzso proteins on human cells and zzso Carcinoma cell lines zzso zzso and zzso all give high values zzso to zzso zzso of zzso while zzso tumors, a human melanoma, and human zzso are negative (less than 10 zzso of zzso Most zzso from autopsy of 2 normal individuals are negative for human zzso at the levels tested (less than 10 zzso of zzso Some zzso have intermediate range expression: zzso 5 to 111 zzso of zzso zzso 24 to zzso and small zzso 39 to zzso One primary colon and one zzso tumor were positive zzso to zzso zzso of zzso while 5 breast zzso a stomach zzso a zzso melanoma, and a kidney tumor were zzso These data indicate that human zzso may be zzso expressed in certain zzso zzso of diverse zzso The potential for zzso as a tumor marker requires further zzso
