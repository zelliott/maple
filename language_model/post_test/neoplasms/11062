zzso free survival zzso is increasingly used as a primary zzso in zzso clinical zzso This paper provides recommendations for optimal trial design, conduct and analysis in situations where zzso has the potential to be an acceptable zzso for regulatory zzso 

These recommendations are based on research performed by the zzso Research and Manufacturers Association zzso sponsored zzso Working Group, including the zzso of 28 zzso Phase III trials from 12 zzso 

zzso In the assessment of zzso there is a critical distinction between measurement error that results from random variation, which by itself tends to zzso treatment effect, versus bias which increases the probability of a false negative or false positive zzso zzso bias can be detected by auditing a random sample of patients by zzso independent, central review zzso zzso zzso analyses generally resulted in smaller treatment effects zzso closer to 1) than analyses that censor patients for potentially zzso events (such as starting other zzso zzso zzso zzso censored analyses zzso are more robust to zzso bias than the zzso zzso 

A sample based zzso audit may be employed in open or partially blinded trials and should not be required in true zzso zzso Patients should be followed until progression even if they have discontinued treatment to be consistent with the zzso zzso zzso should be a standard sensitivity analysis to assess zzso zzso Implementation of these recommendations would zzso and in many cases simplify phase III zzso clinical trials that use a zzso primary zzso
