The zzso activated zzso zzso play an essential role in cell signaling and control a variety of cellular functions including cell zzso survival, zzso and zzso zzso are important regulators in growth factor zzso zzso reorganization and growth zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso has been detected in many zzso and linked to increased migration potential, zzso independent growth and zzso Six zzso of zzso are expressed in human and based on their regulatory properties they have been classified into group I zzso and group II zzso Besides the well studied group I family, members of the group II zzso also emerged as interesting targets for the development of new zzso for cancer zzso The availability of high resolution crystal structures for all group II zzso and their fundamentally different regulatory properties when compared with group I zzso has opened new opportunities for rational drug designing zzso In this review, we zzso the results of recent advances of the function of group II zzso in zzso and zzso as well as opportunities for exploring the unique zzso domain dynamics of this protein family for the design of group II zzso specific zzso
