zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies allows determination of blood flow zzso zzso tissue fraction zzso and volume of distribution zzso zzso with high spatial zzso In this paper the performance of basis function and linear least squares methods for generating zzso flow data were zzso 

zzso Carlo simulations were performed using typical zzso values for brain, zzso and zzso Clinical evaluation was performed using seven cerebral and 10 zzso zzso PET zzso zzso function zzso linear least squares zzso and generalized linear least squares zzso methods were used to calculate zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso Carlo simulations and human studies showed that, for low zzso values zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated with zzso better than zzso for all methods zzso For high zzso zzso zzso use of zzso provided more accurate zzso compared with zzso 

In general, zzso provided the most accurate estimates of zzso zzso and zzso
