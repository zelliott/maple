The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between zzso in type 2 diabetes and risk of cancer zzso or cancer zzso We were interested to determine if data from major zzso controlled trials would support a hypothesis that improving zzso control may reduce the risk of cancer zzso 

We included major zzso controlled trials conducted with an overall aim of intensified zzso control in type 2 zzso We zzso data from published papers and supplemental material and conducted separate zzso of cancer mortality and cancer zzso 

Four trials reported cancer mortality for the intensive zzso events in zzso zzso and standard control zzso events in zzso zzso arms zzso Prospective Diabetes Study zzso 33, zzso 34, Action to Control zzso zzso in Diabetes zzso and Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial zzso the summary risk ratio for cancer mortality was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Excluding the zzso zzso trial resulted in a pooled risk estimate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three trials reported cancer zzso for the study arms zzso in Diabetes and zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR Controlled zzso zzso zzso zzso Clinical Trial In zzso Events zzso zzso zzso for zzso Outcomes and zzso of zzso in Diabetes zzso with zzso events in zzso zzso with improved zzso control and 380 events in zzso zzso in the control zzso the pooled risk ratio for cancer zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Data from large zzso controlled trials of intensified zzso control suggest that cancer risk is not reduced by improving zzso control in type 2 zzso These data therefore do not support the hypothesis that zzso is zzso linked to increased cancer zzso
