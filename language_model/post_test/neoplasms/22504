In this paper, we explore the possibility of using zzso zzso zzso gold zzso zzso as novel contrast imaging agents for tumor zzso imaging in zzso The zzso imaging signal of the tail vein zzso zzso in living organisms can zzso be well distinguished from the background with maximum zzso wavelength at about zzso zzso and the high zzso of zzso promises continuous imaging in zzso The zzso of zzso by the zzso system is relatively low in comparison with other zzso contrast imaging agents due to their zzso zzso size zzso zzso Through the body weight change analysis, the results show that the body weight of the mice zzso with zzso has not been changed obviously in comparison with that of the control mice injected with zzso Furthermore, using zzso and zzso tumor zzso models, in zzso and ex zzso imaging studies show that the zzso zzso zzso are able to be highly accumulated in the tumor areas, thanks to the enhanced zzso and retention zzso zzso And the zzso ratio is about 15 for 6 h zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso appear as very promising contrast imaging agents for in zzso zzso tumor zzso
