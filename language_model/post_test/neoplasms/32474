In contrast to chemotherapy, previous zzso of the zzso carries an increased risk of an adverse pregnancy zzso zzso results exist as regards the ability of the zzso to increase in volume following zzso zzso We measured zzso volume in a cohort of childhood cancer survivors, and assessed zzso response to a high-dose zzso replacement zzso 

zzso volume was assessed by zzso zzso in 100 childhood cancer zzso Three patients with zzso failure and severely reduced zzso volume following abdominal or pelvic zzso were treated with zzso zzso 150 zzso h for three cycles, and zzso zzso zzso was repeated zzso 

zzso volume was significantly reduced in zzso patients who had received direct zzso zzso zzso zzso 13; median 13 zzso range zzso zzso compared with zzso patients who had received chemotherapy only zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso zzso zzso above the zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso or zzso below the zzso not directly involving the zzso zzso zzso 13; 34 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all zzso Among zzso patients a significant correlation was found between age at direct zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso No significant improvement in zzso volume, zzso thickness or zzso artery blood flow was observed in three zzso patients in response to high-dose zzso replacement zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso treatment in childhood does not affect adult zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso at a young age reduces adult zzso zzso The zzso damage is probably zzso
