zzso patterns were examined in a United States cohort of zzso male electric utility workers from five companies to help interpret previous studies of health effects in this zzso 

Using zzso zzso techniques, internal cohort analyses examined total zzso cardiovascular disease, and cancer in relation to duration of employment in each of zzso occupational categories which comprise utility zzso 

Relative to workers who were never involved in utility operations zzso administrative zzso mortality rate ratios among operations workers were higher for total zzso cardiovascular disease, and total zzso Lung cancer risk was consistently zzso whereas increased mortality for other zzso was less zzso 

The results of this study indicate excess risk of total zzso cardiovascular disease, and some zzso among electric utility workers, which could be related to both occupational and zzso risk zzso
