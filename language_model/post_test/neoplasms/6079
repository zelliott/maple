This paper compares three different methods for performing cancer zzso prediction in an area without a cancer registry under a zzso zzso using linear and zzso zzso models with either zzso slopes or a common slope across age zzso The three methods assume that a nearby area with a cancer registration has similar zzso and mortality patterns as the area of interest without a cancer registry where the cancer zzso prediction is carried zzso The three methods differ in modeling zzso zzso modeling the zzso rate zzso zzso modeling the ratio of the number of incident cases to that of mortality zzso and zzso modeling the difference between the zzso rate and the mortality zzso Strategy zzso is a new approach in this type of zzso zzso assessment is made using real data from the cancer registry of zzso Spain, to predict cancer zzso in zzso Spain, and vice zzso zzso of short-term zzso zzso zzso were made for 2001 in zzso using observed cancer zzso and mortality data for zzso from zzso zzso predictions were made for 2002 in zzso using zzso zzso zzso Additionally, long-term (10 zzso zzso rate predictions were made for 2002 in zzso using data from zzso for the period zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso rates minus mortality rates may have the best zzso performance zzso These methods of zzso zzso prediction are highly relevant to health care planning and policy zzso
