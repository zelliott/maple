Cancer among adolescents and young adults zzso zzso years old) is relatively rare but its zzso is increasing zzso To define the extent and nature of the zzso patients, this zzso study was performed to explore trends in cancer zzso survival and risk of second primary zzso in zzso 

Data from all zzso diagnosed with cancer between 1989 and 2009 were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer zzso zzso zzso rates with estimated annual percentage of change zzso and five-year relative survival rates were zzso Relative survival was used as a good approximation of zzso zzso All analyses were zzso by zzso five-year age group and calendar zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso were determined to evaluate the risk of second primary zzso 

23 161 zzso were diagnosed with cancer between 1989 and zzso Since 1989 the cancer zzso has increased significantly from 28 to 43 per 100 zzso person years in males zzso zzso and from 30 to 40 per 100 zzso person years in females zzso zzso The most frequently diagnosed zzso in male zzso included zzso cancer, melanoma and Hodgkin's disease, whereas in females melanoma, breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease were the most frequently occurring zzso zzso relative survival rates were zzso and zzso for males and zzso zzso Over time, the five-year relative survival increased from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso in males and zzso zzso The risk of developing a second primary cancer was increased three to six times in males and two to five times in zzso depending on rules for counting second primary zzso 

Although the overall survival has improved over time, the progress made in zzso for specific zzso is still less compared to improvements made in children and zzso This and the increasing zzso and high risk of second primary zzso warrants further zzso
