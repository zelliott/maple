To evaluate patient census, equipment clinical zzso maximum daily treatment capacity, use factor for major beam delivery zzso and treatment process time for actual treatments delivered by zzso therapy zzso 

The authors have been recording all beam delivery zzso including delivered dose, energy, range, zzso Bragg peak zzso zzso angles, and couch angles for every treatment field in an electronic medical record zzso We analyzed delivery system zzso that had been recorded for every equipment failure and associated zzso These data were used to evaluate the use factor of beam delivery zzso the size of the patient census, and the equipment clinical availability of the zzso The duration of each treatment session from patient walk-in and to patient zzso of the treatment room was measured for 82 patients with zzso at various zzso 

The yearly average equipment clinical availability in the last 3 zzso (June zzso zzso was zzso which exceeded the target of zzso zzso zzso patients had been treated as of August zzso The major disease sites were zzso zzso zzso zzso central nervous system zzso and gastrointestinal zzso zzso have been delivered in approximately zzso treatment zzso The use factor for six beam delivery parameters was also zzso Analysis of the treatment process times indicated that approximately zzso of this time was spent for patient and equipment zzso The other zzso was spent waiting for beam delivery and beam zzso The total treatment process time can be expressed by a zzso zzso of the number of fields per zzso The maximum daily treatment capacity of our facility using the current treatment processes was estimated to be 133 zzso 35 zzso 

This analysis shows that the facility has operated at a high performance level and has treated a large number of patients with a variety of zzso The use factor of beam delivery parameters varies by disease zzso Further improvements in efficiency may be realized in the zzso and zzso processes of zzso
