A mathematical model is developed that describes the zzso zzso at the stationary state of the cell population within a zzso cord, zzso in a zzso arrangement of zzso cells growing around a blood vessel and surrounded by zzso The model, that represents the zzso zzso as a zzso accounts for the migration of cells from the inner to the outer zone of the zzso and describes the cell cycle by a sequence of maturity compartments plus a possible zzso zzso zzso zzso of cycle phase transit times and changes in the cell kinetic parameters within the cord, related to changes of the zzso can be represented in the zzso The theoretical predictions are compared against literature data of the time course of the zzso index and of the fraction of zzso zzso in an experimental zzso after pulse zzso with zzso It is shown that the presence of cell migration within the zzso can lead to a marked zzso of the actual changes along zzso radius of the zzso of cell cycle zzso
