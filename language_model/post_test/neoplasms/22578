The zzso zzso expressed on the surface of various normal and cancer cells, is involved in numerous zzso processes such as zzso zzso and bone zzso Because this zzso plays a key role in zzso and zzso of human tumors, zzso zzso zzso are of great interest to advances in targeted therapy and cancer zzso In this report, zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries containing the zzso acid zzso motif were designed and screened against zzso zzso leukemia cells that had been zzso with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a leading zzso with a built-in handle that binds specifically to zzso and showed comparable binding affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to some of the well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reported in the zzso The zzso form of zzso zzso showed similar binding strength as zzso against zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso to zzso weaker binding affinity than their free zzso zzso was able to bind to both zzso zzso and zzso melanoma cell lines, both of which express high levels of zzso zzso In zzso and ex zzso optical imaging studies with the zzso zzso complex in nude mice bearing zzso or zzso zzso revealed preferential zzso of zzso zzso in zzso When compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher tumor zzso but lower liver zzso
