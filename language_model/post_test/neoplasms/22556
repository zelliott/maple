To perform a zzso critique of the literature evaluating the relationship between external beam zzso zzso parameters and chronic urinary dysfunction to determine why consistent associations between dose and dysfunction have not been zzso 

The zzso literature was reviewed using various electronic medical search engines with appropriate zzso and zzso zzso zzso criteria comprised of; English language articles, published between 1999 and June 2009, incorporating zzso external beam photons in zzso daily zzso A zzso critique was then performed, evaluating the factors affected in the zzso of zzso dose and chronic urinary zzso 

Nine of 22 eligible studies successfully identified a clinically and statistically significant relationship between dose and zzso zzso zzso of external beam zzso dose were compromised by the frequent use of zzso variables which are poor surrogates for the dose received by the lower urinary tract tissue and do not incorporate the effect of daily variations in zzso and zzso zzso The precise categorization of chronic urinary dysfunction was obscured by reliance on zzso and zzso toxicity metrics which vary over zzso 

A high-level zzso for the relationship between external beam zzso dose and chronic urinary dysfunction does not currently zzso The zzso of the actual external beam dose delivered to the functionally important zzso using dose zzso strategies and the use of objective measures of individual manifestations of urinary dysfunction will assist in the identification of robust relationships between dose and urinary dysfunction for application in widespread clinical zzso
