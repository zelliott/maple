Local and drug-free solid tumor zzso by large zzso zzso electric fields leads to zzso of all cellular zzso and has been observed to trigger zzso cell death by zzso To establish zzso effects as the underlying mechanism to inducing zzso we use a zzso system model zzso scale 100 zzso that has zzso shaped liver cells and a zzso liver tissue model zzso scale 200 zzso zzso zzso for the zzso model demonstrate the presence of only zzso pores due to zzso electric field zzso The number of pores in the plasma membrane is such that the average tissue zzso during zzso electric field zzso is even higher than for longer irreversible zzso zzso It is zzso however, that these zzso zzso although numerous, only significantly change the zzso of the cellular zzso to small zzso but not to larger zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso electric fields causes small to moderate temperature zzso Thus, the underlying zzso that trigger cell death by zzso must be zzso electrical zzso presumably leading to different zzso and molecular transport than for much longer irreversible zzso zzso
