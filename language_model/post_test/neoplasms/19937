A simple and accurate survival prediction tool can facilitate decision making processes for hospice patients with advanced zzso The objectives of this study were to explore the association of cardiac zzso functions and survival in patients with advanced cancer and to evaluate the zzso value of heart rate zzso zzso in zzso survival zzso 

A prospective study was conducted on 138 patients with advanced cancer recruited from the hospice ward of a regional hospital in southern zzso Information on functional status and symptom burden of the patients was zzso zzso zzso was obtained for the evaluation of cardiac zzso functions at zzso The end point of the study was defined as the survival status at day 7 after admission to the hospice zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed to evaluate the independent associations between zzso zzso and survival of 7 days or zzso 

The median survival time of the patients was 20 days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the natural zzso zzso power zzso of a value less than 2 zzso zzso and zzso performance status of 3 or 4 zzso zzso were significantly associated with a higher risk of survival of 7 days or zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In hospice patients with zzso zzso an zzso value below 2 at hospice admission was significantly associated with survival of 7 days or zzso zzso might be used as a zzso and objective tool to facilitate medical decision making by improving the accuracy in survival zzso
