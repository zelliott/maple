Fluorescence imaging technique has been used for imaging of biological cells and zzso zzso The zzso zzso quantum dots zzso with a cancer targeting zzso has been taken as a promising zzso and low zzso system for targeted cancer zzso This work reports the synthesis of zzso zzso quantum dots of zzso zzso zinc zzso zzso dots of zzso zinc zzso were prepared by nucleation doping strategy, with zzso acid as stabilizer at 90 in zzso zzso The zzso zinc zzso zzso exhibit strong orange zzso under zzso zzso resistance to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The structure and optical properties of zzso were characterized by scanning electron zzso X-ray zzso dynamic light zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid using zzso as the zzso The zzso binding of both zzso and zzso acid on the surface of zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso by zzso transform infrared zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso assessment of zzso zinc zzso acid zzso use zzso zzso The obtained fluorescent zzso zzso zinc zzso were used for tumor targeting and imaging zzso The zzso zinc zzso acid fluorescent zzso which targeting the tumor cells in the body of nude mouse tumor model would emit orange fluorescence, when exposed to a zzso zzso We investigate the zzso of the zzso zinc zzso acid fluorescent zzso in tumor mouse model by measuring zinc concentration in zzso These studies demonstrate the practicality of zzso zinc zzso acid fluorescent zzso as promising platform for tumor targeting and imaging zzso
