The zzso zzso is a central signaling zzso for inflammatory and immune responses, and zzso zzso signaling is implicated multiple disorders, such as cancer and zzso chronic inflammatory and zzso zzso zzso is regulated by various zzso zzso including zzso and multiple zzso We determined that zzso zzso zzso chain assembly zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso generates a novel type of zzso linear zzso chain and specifically regulates the zzso zzso zzso via the linear zzso of zzso and zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso signaling was attenuated and induced zzso and zzso Many studies on the zzso functions of zzso such as in B cell development, innate immune response, zzso and zzso have been performed zzso This review summarizes these new findings on zzso and linear zzso zzso regulation and their implications in zzso
