zzso analyzing biological zzso maps and experimental data is critical for understanding how biological processes work in different conditions and why different samples exhibit certain zzso This joint analysis, however, poses a significant challenge for zzso Current techniques are either well suited to zzso large amounts of zzso zzso zzso or to represent the zzso of the zzso well, but do not accomplish both at the same zzso To address this we introduce zzso a technique that enables analysts to specify a path of interest in a pathway, extract this path into a separate, linked view, and show detailed experimental data associated with the zzso of this extracted path right next to zzso This juxtaposition of the extracted path and the experimental data allows analysts to simultaneously investigate large amounts of potentially zzso data, thereby solving the problem of joint analysis of zzso and zzso zzso As this approach does not modify the layout of zzso zzso it is compatible with arbitrary graph zzso including those of zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate the technique in context of pathways from the zzso and the zzso zzso We apply experimental data from two public databases, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia zzso and The Cancer Genome zzso zzso that both contain a wide variety of zzso zzso for a large number of zzso In addition, we make use of a smaller zzso of zzso zzso and common zzso zzso To verify the utility of zzso domain experts conducted two case studies where they explore data from the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in the context of relevant zzso
