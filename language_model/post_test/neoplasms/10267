zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit cell cycle zzso A lower expression level of only zzso has been correlated with poorer prognosis in various types of clinical zzso The difference may be the result of distinct genes downstream of these zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso genes specifically zzso by zzso correlate with poor prognosis in multiple tumor zzso We performed zzso expression profiling in zzso cells zzso either zzso or zzso and identified their regulatory zzso In zzso zzso factor prediction indicated that most of the genes specifically zzso by zzso are controlled by zzso Under the hypothesis that zzso genes are responsible for poor zzso we predicted prognosis in four types of cancer based on genes with the zzso zzso and found a significant association between the expression of zzso genes and poor zzso
