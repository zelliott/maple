The zzso family of DNA zzso consists of specialized DNA unwinding zzso that promote zzso stability through their participation in a number of cellular zzso including DNA zzso zzso DNA damage zzso and DNA repair zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of some but not all members of the zzso zzso family can lead to human syndromes which are characterized by marked zzso instability and an increased predisposition to zzso An zzso zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been established, and this interaction is important in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso are critical in the cell because they relieve zzso stress that arises when DNA is zzso zzso function by breaking and rejoining zzso By zzso of the rejoining function, zzso zzso are potent zzso agents that have been used successfully in the treatment of zzso zzso and other zzso This review discusses the roles of zzso zzso in zzso stability, the interplay between zzso zzso and zzso 3s, and current and future prospects for targeting these interactions to develop novel zzso zzso
