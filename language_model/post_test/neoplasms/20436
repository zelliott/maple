zzso frequently acquire resistance to zzso that is expected to contribute to zzso zzso and reduce sensitivity to zzso In fact, zzso of zzso tumor zzso gene resulting in suppression of zzso serves as a negative zzso zzso Surprisingly, expression of a strong zzso protein zzso another mechanism to avoid zzso was found to be associated with a favorable zzso This paradoxical zzso function of zzso has been explained in literature based on the negative effect of zzso on cell zzso Here, by analyzing accumulated experimental and clinical data, we provide evidence supporting another hypothesis that defines zzso as an accelerator of tumor zzso The mechanism of zzso function of zzso is based on creation of tumors that maintain control of zzso stability by eliminating selective advantages for the cells that acquire resistance to zzso through loss of zzso Thus, zzso of zzso does not lead to loss of zzso stability and creates tumor environment that no longer supports further tumor progression and zzso of zzso can be considered as factors suppressing tumor zzso
