zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso have been described as potent zzso of selected zzso immune responses and the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso has been examined either alone or as a vaccine zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso therapy could be an effective tool for zzso of not only conventional zzso class zzso zzso but also of those zzso that have lost zzso class I expression during their zzso To address this hypothesis, we employed the animal model resembling zzso class zzso and zzso human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso A cell line transformed with zzso E6 and zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso class zzso line, and its zzso class zzso zzso zzso and zzso were injected into zzso zzso mice and the growing zzso were subjected to zzso with zzso zzso zzso The therapy started either 1 day after the challenge with the zzso cells or later, when the zzso had reached a palpable zzso In both settings, zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the growth of zzso class zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso whose mechanism of action preferably involves indirect zzso of the natural killer cells, induced zzso of the zzso class zzso zzso zzso but not of the zzso class zzso zzso zzso This study zzso that synthetic zzso zzso have a potential for the therapy of both zzso class zzso and zzso zzso and thus could be also used against zzso that tend to zzso their zzso class I zzso
