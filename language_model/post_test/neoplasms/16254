zzso processes depend on the precise coordination of different cell types and a complex exchange of signals, many of which derive from new specific components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso components thus represent appealing targets for the selective delivery of therapeutic molecules to newly forming tumor zzso zzso of a previous study indicated that a high affinity zzso zzso zzso to zzso a domain contained in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso selectively and efficiently targets tumor zzso The present study shows that a fusion protein between zzso and zzso 2 zzso mediates the selective delivery and concentration of zzso to tumor zzso thereby leading to a dramatic enhancement of the therapeutic properties of the zzso By contrast, zzso fused to an irrelevant zzso zzso used as a control fusion protein showed neither zzso in tumors nor therapeutic zzso zzso in mice treated with zzso were significantly smaller compared to those in animals treated with zzso the control fusion zzso or zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, no significant differences in size were observed among the tumors from the different control groups zzso the control fusion zzso a mixture of zzso and zzso or saline zzso zzso analysis of tumor infiltrates demonstrated a significantly higher number of T zzso natural killer cells, and zzso as well as increased zzso zzso zzso in tumors from animals treated with zzso compared to tumors from control zzso The fact that zzso is zzso zzso in human and zzso thus ensuring that zzso zzso equally well with human and zzso zzso should ultimately zzso transfer of this zzso to clinical zzso
