T cell zzso were analyzed in 33 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with either of two zzso zzso a partially zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso Included in the zzso group were eight patients with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso ratio was used to define the balance between zzso and zzso T cell zzso With both zzso zzso the mean zzso ratio decreased 24 hours after the first zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso group, the decrease in ratio was related to an increase in zzso zzso in the zzso group, it was accompanied by a small decrease in the proportion of zzso cells that was greater than the decrease in zzso zzso Patients treated with zzso were followed for the first three weeks of zzso Most patients treated with zzso at all dose levels, ranging from 1 X zzso to 54 X zzso units per day, had a decrease in zzso ratio on Day zzso No substantial change in the ratio was observed on Days 7, 14, and zzso Patients with zzso and zzso zzso had responses similar to those of patients with other zzso treated with zzso In conclusion, although both zzso zzso and zzso induce immediate decreases in the zzso ratio, the T cell zzso primarily responsible for the decrease varies with the source of zzso
