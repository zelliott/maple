zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso were examined for their ability to enhance major zzso complex zzso expression on a variety of human tumor and normal tissue zzso zzso expression of zzso correlated with decreased target zzso to zzso by fresh peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not as clearly with cells with zzso killer zzso zzso These studies revealed zzso zzso enhancement after zzso h of incubation in zzso Resistance to zzso by natural killer zzso cells was best demonstrated after 72 zzso Further, zzso and zzso were synergistic in their effects on zzso expression and induction of resistance of the cultured zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was usually zzso after target zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and vascular zzso cells with zzso also consistently resulted in zzso class I enhancement and resistance to zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was zzso zzso The brief incubation of fresh zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso highly zzso toward cultured cells, but with no activity against fresh zzso zzso cell lines treated with zzso and zzso were rendered relatively resistant to zzso by these activated zzso Fresh tumor zzso expression and zzso zzso was unchanged after zzso zzso Additionally, there was no correlation between the level of zzso class I or class II expression and zzso zzso to any fresh, zzso melanoma zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso possess different mechanisms of tumor recognition or zzso than cells with zzso activity or cells briefly incubated zzso zzso in zzso The ability of zzso zzso to lyse the cultured zzso tumor target was markedly increased by zzso of the targets with zzso and zzso Finally, it appears that zzso treatment and the zzso zzso production of zzso by zzso should not adversely affect tumor zzso to current zzso using zzso
