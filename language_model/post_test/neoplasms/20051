There exists a very large literature suggesting that T cells come in a variety of species and that without the action of zzso tumors would seldom survive zzso by T cell zzso We believe that much of the evidence supporting the role of zzso in cancer is compatible with a perhaps simpler hypothesis based upon the demonstration that that small quantities of zzso T cells tend to stimulate tumors while larger quantities of seemingly the same cells are zzso (an zzso zzso This possibility seems to destroy much of the need to zzso a role for T cell zzso zzso in cancer, but the exposure of zzso T cells to zzso may convert them into zzso zzso do zzso Furthermore, many other data suggest the possibility that immune zzso of cancer could be a laboratory artifact seldom if ever seen in unmodified zzso
