zzso featuring a basic nitrogen at the zzso atom position in zzso rings, gain increasing interest in the search for novel approaches towards cancer drug zzso This compound class is known as competitive zzso of zzso manipulation zzso such as zzso which are involved in tumor cell invasion and zzso Such zzso are also responsible for the attachment of zzso to the cell surface of tumor cells, displayed as zzso zzso and zzso which play an important role in zzso zzso and tumor zzso Furthermore, cancer cells show an extremely active zzso system which is reflected by enhancement of zzso zzso zzso were found to interact with zzso zzso responsible for this kind of action in cancer cells and thus open a new compound class in the research field of finding new zzso zzso This review will focus on the role of zzso in cancer therapy and will give an overview of their zzso
