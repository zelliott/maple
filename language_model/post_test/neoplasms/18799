zzso of serum zzso levels with a variety of incident diseases and mortality have been zzso The present study attempted to expand the body of evidence to especially relevant occupational zzso in which exposure to established zzso zzso may greatly differ from the general zzso 

The study was based on occupational health examinations conducted from 1986 to 1992 in zzso German male workers from the construction industry, aged zzso zzso and other zzso information were collected during the zzso Vital status follow-up was conducted through zzso zzso of baseline zzso levels zzso at zzso with zzso and zzso mortality were examined by zzso plotting and multiple adjusted Cox zzso zzso 

A total of zzso deaths occurred during zzso zzso of zzso The risk of death due to any cause was zzso increased in subjects in the highest zzso versus lowest zzso zzso zzso To varying zzso elevated zzso was associated with higher mortality due to cancer, zzso zzso and zzso causes, as well as zzso 

The findings in this cohort provide evidence for zzso being associated with a broad range of causes of death, including less investigated zzso Some characteristics of the observed patterns need to be seen in the context of our zzso featuring particularly high zzso zzso
