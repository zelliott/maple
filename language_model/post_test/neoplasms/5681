The colony formation in zzso of human zzso zzso was used as a test system to study the zzso activity of zzso zzso at the cellular zzso zzso was additionally studied in zzso in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a clear zzso effect in zzso At continuous exposure with zzso zzso 2 out of 11 of the zzso responded (a gastric and a small cell lung zzso At zzso zzso zzso the zzso response was zzso zzso and at 1 zzso the compound was active in all zzso The zzso tolerable doses of zzso in zzso have been determined in zzso bearing zzso zzso In the zzso zzso given multiple dose schedules the respective zzso doses indicated that the tolerable cumulative dose increases when lower doses are given more zzso This also enhances the zzso activity in zzso zzso to zzso zzso On the other hand, continuous infusion strongly diminished the tolerable dose as well as the zzso zzso zzso was also active against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso responses was found in the following zzso implanted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso as well as in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso a gastric zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso long-range zzso effects of zzso were investigated in zzso mice, cured after surviving treatment with zzso doses of zzso by zzso the protein zzso capacity of the retinal by zzso the zzso zzso and zzso levels as zzso In none of these cases could a significant reduction in either zzso or zzso levels be measured and no changes were seen zzso
