Recent evidence points to zzso multifaceted zzso zzso factor zzso in the majority of human zzso a priority target for zzso How to target zzso is less clear, given its involvement in a variety of key functions in healthy zzso Here we report on the action mechanism of the zzso interfering zzso termed zzso which demonstrated astounding therapeutic efficacy in transgenic mouse cancer models in zzso zzso action is different from the one that can be obtained by gene knockout or zzso zzso approaches designed to block all functions of a gene zzso This zzso to cause an zzso zzso that destroys some protein interactions of the zzso zzso and keeps others intact, with the result of zzso the zzso zzso zzso selectively targets zzso protein zzso it binds zzso and zzso Max and zzso but does not bind Mad or select zzso zzso Specifically, it prevents zzso binding to promoter zzso and zzso of target genes while retaining zzso dependent binding to promoters and zzso This is accompanied by broad zzso changes such as decreased zzso and increased zzso at zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso zzso is channeled to repression and its activity appears to switch from a zzso to a tumor zzso zzso Given the extraordinary therapeutic impact of zzso in animal models, these data suggest that successfully targeting zzso for cancer therapy might require a similar twofold action, in order to prevent zzso binding to zzso and, at the same time, keep zzso genes that would be zzso by zzso
