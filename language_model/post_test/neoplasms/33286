To assess the adverse effects of zzso zzso treating zzso cancer pain in comparison with slow release oral zzso 

A systematic review of the literature in the zzso and zzso databases from 1966 to June 2007 was independently performed by two zzso All phase 3 zzso trials comparing zzso zzso and zzso oral zzso in the treatment of zzso cancer pain were considered eligible and included in the zzso The primary end point was the overall adverse effects odds ratio zzso secondary end points were the overall gastrointestinal adverse effects, zzso zzso zzso patients' zzso and trial zzso zzso was analyzed using the zzso test, and outcome analysis was performed using a random effect zzso an alpha error lower than zzso was assumed as statistically zzso 

Four trials met the selection zzso The safety of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso oral zzso was analyzed in 425 zzso A significant difference in favor of zzso zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso and patients' preference zzso zzso in the three trials investigating zzso zzso No significant differences were observed for overall adverse effects, overall gastrointestinal adverse effects, overall zzso adverse effects, zzso zzso zzso trial withdrawal, and changes in zzso zzso 

Although no difference in the overall adverse effect profile exists between zzso zzso and slow release oral zzso the difference in some adverse effects zzso zzso seems to favor zzso zzso in the preference of patients with zzso cancer zzso
