The paper describes the preparation and evaluation of zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso network of zzso acid zzso and gelatin zzso Post surgical zzso efficacy and zzso of zzso from the implanted zzso zzso was investigated on zzso zzso tumor model using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed as a zzso agent for zzso chains whereas G was kept zzso The effect of zzso concentration on various zzso properties such as zzso behavior, zzso degradation behavior, drug release and zzso interactions was investigated by various zzso zzso zzso zzso networks zzso with zzso zzso zzso concentration showed degradation within 20 days in zzso buffer zzso zzso To determine the in zzso zzso zzso zzso and drug laden zzso implants (65 zzso 5 zzso of 10 zzso were implanted in tumor cavity post tumor zzso After predetermined time intervals zzso 7, 11, 14, 20 and zzso drug zzso was assessed in zzso tumor zzso residual zzso and all vital zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso heart, lung and blood zzso The drug distribution study showed the concentration of drug in the zzso tumor periphery and residual zzso decreased with increasing time; on the 7th day, drug concentration was highest while, on the 25th day, it was zzso however, insignificant quantities of the drug was found in vital zzso zzso examination revealed no sign of tumor recurrence until the 25th day with zzso necrosis and slight inflammation in treated the zzso In zzso results established that these zzso implants can be zzso as post surgical therapy for solid zzso
