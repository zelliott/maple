There are very limited data on cancer among zzso zzso The data that are available seldom appear outside individual registry zzso Without coalescing and assessing such information, the epidemiology of cancer among Hispanics cannot be zzso 

This article presents an overall view of the epidemiology of cancer among Hispanic populations in the United zzso 

Major types of cancer were reviewed from geographic areas with 1) large zzso populations and 2) zzso cancer zzso that cover zzso of the zzso Hispanic zzso zzso rates, standardized rate ratios, and ranks of the top zzso are presented for Hispanics and zzso by zzso 

Hispanic men had consistently lower rates of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and oral cavity as well as of melanoma and zzso zzso than zzso zzso Among Hispanic men, higher rates were observed for zzso of the stomach, liver, and zzso Compared with the rates in zzso women, Hispanic women had consistently lower rates of zzso of the breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and oral zzso zzso lymphoma, and melanoma and higher rates of zzso of the zzso zzso stomach, liver, and zzso Perhaps more importantly, however, was that, within zzso Hispanic zzso the top five sites of cancer for women were breast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For men, the top sites were usually zzso zzso zzso stomach, and zzso Furthermore, some geographic areas showed differences in the order of importance within these five sites, while in other areas, the top five zzso for Hispanic men included kidney and zzso zzso liver cancer, and zzso zzso For women, other leading zzso mentioned were zzso cancer, zzso lymphoma, and gallbladder zzso 

Hispanics had consistently lower rates of breast, zzso zzso and colon zzso than zzso In some geographic regions, however, differences in cancer zzso rates with respect to specific sites existed between the zzso Hispanic zzso Furthermore, the rankings demonstrated that, even if Hispanics have lower rates of the most common zzso than zzso such sites are still the most important zzso among Hispanic zzso 

Cancer is a major problem among zzso Hispanic zzso The information given in this article can be used to develop zzso studies and cancer control zzso Data limitations and recommendations for improving data quality are zzso
