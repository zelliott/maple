A type of zzso zzso zzso delivery systems zzso with uniform particle size zzso and excellent zzso was developed by in zzso zzso among zzso zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso and silicon species forming zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso via a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a highly precise zzso drug release behavior both zzso and zzso and exhibited high drug efficiencies against drug-resistant zzso cells as well as zzso zzso cells by the zzso zzso delivery, the sustained drug release and the high zzso and zzso resistance zzso zzso The zzso mechanism was proved to be a synergistic cell cycle zzso effect resulted from the zzso of the zzso zzso These results demonstrated a very promising zzso for the zzso controlled drug release and the cancer zzso zzso
