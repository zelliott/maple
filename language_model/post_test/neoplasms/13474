A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been raised following mouse zzso with cultured human zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed a strong zzso within tumor vessels in zzso and breast zzso samples, and the distribution was consistent with zzso association with vascular zzso zzso A zzso procedure of the zzso was developed starting from zzso an immortalized human zzso cell zzso zzso mass, zzso sequence of the zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cell surface allowed identification with human zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a group of normal and transformed cell lines showed that, besides zzso cells and zzso leukemia cells already shown to be positive, fetal zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were also positive for this zzso zzso analysis of several normal adult zzso revealed a more extensive presence of the zzso in normal vessels compared to that described with previously characterized zzso In fact, even though the zzso was weaker than in tumor zzso all zzso were found to be positive, at least in zzso except for normal zzso Moreover, in some zzso zzso and zzso zzso a positive reaction was observed in the zzso Since zzso has been proposed as a possible target for zzso therapy in tumor patients and our data demonstrate a sizable amount of zzso in normal vessels and zzso its clinical use should be carefully zzso
