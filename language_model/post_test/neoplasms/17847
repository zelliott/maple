zzso gene expression may be required for the clinical development of certain gene zzso Several approaches have been developed that allow zzso control of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso system in which zzso or its zzso function as zzso zzso These compounds can also act as direct zzso agents via zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso We describe the development of an zzso zzso zzso virus zzso expression cassette that allows zzso gene expression from a single zzso in zzso and in zzso After demonstrating multiple cycles of zzso zzso induction following a single administration of an zzso zzso in zzso application of this regulated zzso gene expression system to the zzso control of zzso therapy was evaluated in zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso were constructed zzso a soluble inhibitor of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso In two subcutaneous models of glioblastoma, regulated expression of the zzso inhibitor via zzso zzso gene transfer, in combination with zzso was shown to decrease tumor growth rate zzso The dual properties of zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso exploited in combination with an zzso zzso agent to provide a novel approach for the treatment of zzso zzso
