New efforts to guide and prioritize the selection of cancer drug targets are urgently needed, as is evident by the slow development of novel zzso agents and the narrow therapeutic index of existing zzso Given these limitations, the current study was conducted to explore the zzso features defining the therapeutic success that can result from targeting a particular zzso 

zzso was based on zzso features specific to known successful zzso targets and combining them in a linear zzso resulting in calculation of an enrichment score for each zzso zzso description, the search tool used in this study, enriched existing drug target candidates by up to zzso at an approximately 50% recall rate, covering approximately 24 zzso genes or approximately zzso of zzso More importantly, the target category with high attrition rate was classified from target category with low attrition rate, allowing to refine the drug development zzso Biological relevance of the parameters zzso the enrichment score was zzso zzso in zzso effects was independently demonstrated by literature zzso zzso these enrichment scores on existing zzso zzso and zzso procedures for prospective target selection may enhance the efficiency and accuracy of target identification and accelerate drug zzso 

The software used in this work is available upon zzso
