The First International Conference on zzso zzso focused on vascular targeting agents zzso that zzso or destroy the pre-existing blood vessels of solid zzso The zzso cause a rapid shutdown in the blood supply to the tumor that kills tumor cells by zzso them of oxygen and zzso The zzso are distinct from zzso agents, which prevent new blood vessel zzso Two major types of zzso are being developed for zzso the zzso zzso that use zzso zzso and growth factors to deliver zzso zzso and zzso zzso to tumor zzso and the small zzso zzso that do not specifically zzso to tumor zzso but exploit zzso differences between tumor and normal tissue zzso to induce acute vascular shutdown in zzso Both approaches were described at the meeting and highlighted the variety of zzso in zzso development, their selectivity for tumor zzso their rapid zzso effects, and the improved activity seen when combined with other zzso approaches zzso zzso drugs, radiation, zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso Early clinical studies were summarized for the small zzso zzso the zzso drugs, zzso A4 zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso acid zzso The agents lacked the bone zzso and gastrointestinal zzso associated with zzso zzso As a marker of biological effect, blood flow reductions in tumors were measured using magnetic resonance imaging or zzso zzso zzso for all of the agents tested, and zzso clinical activity was zzso These agents are now being evaluated in combined zzso studies to see whether the impressive results obtained in experimental models can be translated into zzso
