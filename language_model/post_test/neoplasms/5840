Combination therapy of zzso with zzso alpha zzso has been shown in several in zzso as well as in zzso models to be zzso In order to decrease toxicity seen with zzso zzso continuous zzso in place of zzso administration, have been zzso This led us to investigate the combination of zzso continuous infusion zzso with repeated zzso dosing in a phase I zzso dose escalation zzso A group of 17 patients were enrolled in this zzso The maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso was 20 zzso per day when combined with 3 zzso zzso units zzso given three times a zzso The zzso zzso seen included zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso analyses of free zzso or zzso platinum revealed that the zzso curve fitted a zzso zzso zzso parameters of zzso were found to correlate with zzso Both increases in the maximum concentration of zzso achieved zzso as well as the zzso zzso for free zzso correlated with the zzso of zzso and vomiting (both acute and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso None of the patients exhibited significant changes in zzso function while on this zzso The free platinum levels were higher than found in similar studies evaluating comparable zzso infusions zzso The enhanced zzso seen in this trial may be explained by the results of an in zzso study using human plasma spiked with zzso and zzso that revealed decreased protein binding of zzso by zzso Of the 17 patients treated, two zzso cell lung cancer patients obtained a partial response and one zzso melanoma patient obtained complete resolution of a zzso zzso zzso Considering the acceptable toxicity seen in this trial, we recommend phase II trials be conducted with continuous infusion zzso with zzso in the treatment of zzso cell lung zzso
