Cell growth demands new protein zzso which requires zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a large proportion of the cell's resources and energy, and so is tightly regulated through an intricate signaling network to guarantee zzso Thus, events that impair zzso zzso cause zzso zzso In response to this stress, several zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso to the zzso and bind to zzso zzso zzso and degradation of the tumor zzso zzso is then zzso resulting in zzso zzso and the induction of zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso stress is therefore a quality control surveillance mechanism that monitors the synthesis and assembly of the zzso and protein components of zzso Although zzso stress signaling pathways have been extensively zzso critical questions remain about their regulatory zzso For example, how do zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso to exert their functions, and do these zzso zzso influence the prognosis of human cancer zzso Our laboratory recently identified the zzso protein zzso as a novel regulator of zzso zzso zzso sequesters the zzso protein zzso in the zzso preventing it from binding to zzso zzso is then free to degrade zzso favoring tumor cell zzso zzso the level of zzso in a tumor is becoming a useful zzso marker for human zzso This review summarizes the evidence that links zzso stress to zzso and casts zzso as an zzso player in human cancer zzso
