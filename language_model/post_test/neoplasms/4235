The tumor zzso zzso plays a key role in regulating the cell cycle and zzso in differentiated zzso zzso mice lacking functional zzso develop normally but die from multiple zzso shortly after zzso There have been hints that zzso is involved in zzso but given the relatively normal development of zzso zzso mice, the significance of these data has been difficult to zzso To examine the role of zzso in zzso development, we have determined the results of blocking its activity in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

Two different methods have been used to block zzso protein activity in developing zzso zzso expression of zzso forms of human zzso and zzso expression of the zzso negative regulator, zzso zzso In both instances, zzso of zzso activity blocked the ability of zzso early zzso to undergo differentiation and resulted in the formation of large cellular masses reminiscent of zzso The ability of zzso zzso to induce such zzso tumors was suppressed by zzso with zzso human or zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso activated zzso gene expression and underwent the zzso transition zzso Such cells continued to divide at approximately normal rates but did not form normal embryonic zzso and never underwent terminal zzso remaining as large, zzso cell masses that were often associated with the neural tube or zzso 

In zzso the maternal stockpile of zzso zzso and protein seems to be essential for normal zzso zzso zzso function results in an early block to zzso Although it is possible that zzso human zzso proteins have a dominant zzso or zzso activity in zzso and that this is responsible for the development of tumors, most of the evidence indicates that this is not the zzso Whatever the basis of the block to zzso these results indicate that zzso zzso are a sensitive system in which to explore the role of zzso in normal development and in zzso zzso
