To describe and analyze the zzso and trends of liver cancer mortality during the past fifty years in zzso zzso 

zzso mortality survey was conducted to get the data on liver cancer death in the period of zzso and the data from 1972 to 2007 were obtained from the records of cancer registration in zzso The crude mortality rate zzso of liver cancer, and zzso rate by Chinese population zzso and by world population zzso were calculated and zzso The total percent changes zzso and annual percent changes zzso were used for evaluating the increasing trends of the zzso The zzso rate, zzso rate, truncated rate of the age group 35 - 64, cumulative rate of the age group zzso cumulative risk, zzso and the rate for zzso cohort were zzso 

The natural death rate in zzso residents for the past zzso period experienced a wave zzso of zzso in 1958 down to zzso in 1979, and up to zzso in zzso The mortality rate for zzso zzso was increased from zzso per 100, zzso to zzso per 100, zzso The mortality rate of liver cancer, being zzso per 100, 100 in 1958 was increased to zzso per 100, zzso in 1972, and up to zzso per 100, zzso in zzso According to the registration data of 1972 - 2007, the death from liver cancer was accounted for zzso of all deaths due to zzso with a zzso of zzso per 100, zzso zzso of zzso per 100, zzso and zzso zzso zzso 100, zzso in zzso The truncated rate for the age group 35 - 64 was zzso per 100, zzso and the cumulative rate for the age group zzso and the cumulative risk were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for males was zzso per 100, zzso and for females was zzso per 100, zzso with a sex ratio of zzso For the period of 1972 - 2007, the PC for zzso was zzso and zzso was zzso showing an increasing variation zzso The zzso for zzso and zzso however, were zzso with a percentage of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso mortality rates by period showed a decreasing trend for those under age of zzso Moreover, zzso cohort analysis showed a more rapid lowering mortality in the age groups zzso zzso zzso and 15-, that is, those born after zzso 

Liver cancer remains the leading death cause due to zzso in zzso with a continuing higher crude mortality zzso Yet the zzso mortality rate has presented a declining zzso The liver cancer mortality in young people in zzso demonstrates a continuously falling zzso The campaign for the control of liver cancer in zzso has achieved initial zzso
