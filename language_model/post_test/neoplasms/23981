zzso in the average gene copy number zzso of the zzso zzso especially the zzso zzso have been found in a variety of human zzso Such information is useful with respect to prognosis of the zzso Poor zzso and DNA damage complicate quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso we describe a quantitative zzso method for the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The method comprises a competitive and differential zzso in a zzso reaction zzso zzso or zzso zzso sequences of the zzso and the human zzso zzso reference gene and two competitors for the zzso and reference gene were amplified with two primer pairs zzso The competitors were chosen to be amplified with the same efficiency as the zzso zzso Using this method, we confirmed zzso and zzso amplification in cancer cell lines and tumor zzso and we also detected zzso zzso Furthermore, gene dosage decreases were zzso zzso an zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso the detection of both increases and decreases in zzso with high zzso sensitivity, and zzso This method is therefore suitable for clinical studies on zzso zzso dosage zzso
