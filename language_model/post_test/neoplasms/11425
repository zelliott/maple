We examined cancer screening and risk factor patterns in California using 4 different statistical zzso of American Indian and Alaska Native zzso zzso 

We used the 2001 California Health zzso zzso to compare cancer screening and risk factor data across 4 different zzso zzso We calculated weighted prevalence estimates by gender and zzso for cancer screening and risk factors, zzso zzso and access to care zzso We compared zzso men and women with members of other racial groups and examined outcomes among zzso men and women using the 4 zzso zzso 

Although some differences were small, in general, screening and risk factor rates among American zzso zzso were most similar to rates among zzso when the most inclusive multiracial zzso approach was used and least similar when the more exclusive US census zzso approach was zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso are among the most difficult obstacles to obtaining accurate and zzso data on the zzso zzso Our analysis suggests some guidelines for overcoming these zzso
