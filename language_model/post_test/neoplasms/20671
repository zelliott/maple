zzso agents represent a highly zzso class of zzso compounds that are extremely effective zzso zzso Unfortunately, zzso agents damage both zzso and zzso zzso Bone zzso is especially sensitive to damage by zzso agent chemotherapy, and is a zzso tissue when treating cancer zzso One strategy to overcome bone zzso sensitivity to zzso agent exposure involves gene transfer of the DNA repair protein zzso DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso into bone zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso is of particular interest because it functions to protect against the zzso zzso and zzso effects of many zzso zzso zzso By increasing the zzso DNA zzso repair capacity of bone zzso cells, it is hoped that this tissue will become zzso zzso thereby increasing the therapeutic window for the selective destruction of zzso zzso In this review, the field of zzso DNA zzso gene transfer into bone zzso cells will be summarized with an emphasis placed on strategies used for suppressing the deleterious side effects of zzso zzso agent zzso
