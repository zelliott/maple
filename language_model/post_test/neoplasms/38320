zzso instability is considered by many authors the key engine of zzso However, mounting evidence indicates that a small population of drug resistant cancer cells can also be a key component of tumor zzso Such cancer stem cells would define a compartment effectively acting as the source of most tumor zzso Here we study the interplay between these two conflicting components of cancer dynamics using two types of tissue zzso Both mean field and zzso models are zzso It is shown that tissue architecture affects the pattern of cancer dynamics and that unstable zzso spontaneously organize into a zzso population of highly unstable zzso This dominant population is in fact separated from the zzso compartment by an instability zzso where almost no cancer cells are zzso The possible implications of this prediction are zzso
