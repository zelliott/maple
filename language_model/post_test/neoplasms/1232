zzso of normal tissue are relatively insensitive to heat, while zzso cells in culture are highly sensitive to zzso zzso This differential zzso sensitivity is most pronounced when the cells of normal and zzso zzso are exposed to heat in their exponential growth zzso zzso survival zzso of zzso and zzso cells with and without zzso zzso treatment showed that the zzso zzso line exhibited significant enhancement of zzso when the zzso cells were exposed to elevated temperatures zzso for 3 zzso Similar heat treatment of zzso zzso zzso did not appreciably enhance the radiation zzso The potential significance of these findings for clinical zzso is zzso
