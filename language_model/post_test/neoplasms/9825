Some tumor cells contain additional DNA sequences that are microscopically observed as zzso or zzso zzso contain repeated zzso zzso zzso regions and zzso may be present in the same cell, and both may vary in size and zzso zzso or zzso are not the result of culture conditions or in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso fragments or zzso should be zzso zzso may be either C band negative or zzso The amplified sequences of zzso are not necessarily located at the normal zzso sites of these genes in zzso zzso It is assumed that zzso is zzso active in tumor cells as it is in drug resistant zzso The specific gene products of zzso or zzso are zzso zzso and zzso may change the response of the cell to cancer zzso zzso
