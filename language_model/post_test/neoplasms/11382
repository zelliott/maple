This review summarizes data demonstrating the role of zzso in tumor development, zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is expressed zzso in some kinds of zzso cells and zzso in zzso cells after stimulation with zzso and growth zzso Originally zzso was considered to have a function in the initiation of zzso In the last years it became evident that zzso plays a role in zzso and pathological processes outside the zzso zzso of zzso expression appears to be characteristic of tumor zzso In a variety of human tumors it was shown by zzso that zzso can be expressed in zzso cells as well as in zzso zzso or zzso zzso Such abnormal zzso expression contributes to the zzso process by a shift in the balance between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Observations of a significant correlation between elevated zzso expression with increased zzso density and zzso expression underline the zzso involvement in tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso expression influences also zzso The effect of zzso on zzso may result from its zzso effect, but also from the production of growth factors or zzso zzso
