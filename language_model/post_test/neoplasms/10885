Adult stem cells are maintained in a zzso state but are able to exit zzso and rapidly expand and differentiate in response to zzso The zzso state appears to be necessary for preserving the zzso of stem cells and is a critical factor in the resistance of cancer stem cells zzso to chemotherapy and targeted zzso Limited knowledge about zzso mechanisms has prevented significant advances in targeting of drug-resistant zzso zzso populations in the zzso Thus, an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso in adult stem cells is critical for the development of zzso targeted therapies against zzso zzso in different zzso Recent studies have provided a better understanding of the intrinsic and zzso regulatory mechanisms that control stem cell zzso It is now appreciated that the zzso gene plays a critical role in regulating stem cell zzso Other intrinsic regulatory mechanisms include the zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors and signaling through zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms include zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this article, we review current advances in understanding normal stem cell zzso their significance for zzso zzso and drug resistance, and the potential clinical applications of these zzso
