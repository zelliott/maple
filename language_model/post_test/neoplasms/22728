zzso modulated radiation therapy introduces strong spatial and zzso zzso of the dose delivery that may have therapeutic benefits, as yet zzso 

Experimental evidence for spatial and zzso zzso affecting the cell survival following in zzso zzso has been derived using zzso zzso 

The experimental results show that the survival status of a cell is strongly influenced by the spatial dose zzso The classical bystander effect of decreased survival has now been supplemented by observations of increased survival, which may result from the same or different signaling zzso zzso dose zzso experiments show that dose zzso significantly increases cell zzso An appropriate choice of zzso dose zzso pattern enables cell death to be zzso or minimized for a constant dose and delivery zzso 

zzso effects challenge the assumption that outcome is solely dependent on local zzso zzso zzso zzso via protracted treatments and time varying dose delivery both affect the cell zzso The presence of bystander and zzso effects emphasize the need for a mathematical framework which incorporates their influence on cell zzso
