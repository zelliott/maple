High expression of circulating plasma vascular zzso growth factor zzso in patients with cancer is an indicator of poor treatment zzso Similarly, zzso in tumors, as measured by oxygen needle electrodes, has been found to predict for zzso zzso These two zzso may be related because zzso is a potent zzso of zzso expression in zzso However, the demonstration of a relationship between zzso and zzso in human tumors has, to date, been indirect or even zzso The purpose of this study was to test whether this unexpected result was caused by factors unique to human tumors, or whether the prior results could have been influenced by the known complexities of zzso zzso zzso we undertook a direct assessment of zzso induction in human tumors using in zzso zzso and compared its distribution with that of zzso as measured by the distribution of zzso of the zzso marker zzso The distribution of both markers was assessed in relationship to the distribution of blood vessels, as measured by zzso to zzso Our hypothesis was that zzso zzso and zzso would zzso assuming that zzso of the former was not zzso Four zzso cell zzso three zzso and one zzso zzso were zzso When zzso zzso signal was zzso its zzso zzso with regional zzso of zzso zzso The strongest levels of both signals were sometimes adjacent to regions of tissue zzso However, we were unable to predict absolute levels of zzso binding based on absolute levels of zzso zzso zzso for all tumors zzso regions with relatively low levels of zzso binding had relatively low or zzso zzso zzso We found moderate zzso binding in some zzso cells but zzso zzso was not expressed by these differentiated zzso The paradigm that zzso and zzso expression are linked in human tumors is supported by the data presented zzso A better understanding of the biology behind zzso zzso including its zzso by zzso is important for zzso its use as a zzso indicator and/or modulating its presence with zzso zzso
