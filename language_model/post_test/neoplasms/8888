The cellular response to highly zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso involves the exquisite coordination of multiple signaling and repair zzso Here, we conducted a functional zzso screen and identified zzso as a zzso required for efficient assembly of the zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso at zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein frequently zzso in zzso of various zzso To further investigate the role of zzso in zzso repair, we used a gene targeting approach to knockout zzso this zzso in chicken zzso zzso We show that zzso cells are zzso sensitive to zzso and other agents that induce zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso gene conversion, and zzso exhibit an increased frequency of zzso breaks after zzso zzso We also show that zzso is recruited to zzso in the proximity of a single zzso zzso zzso Finally, we identified six zzso zzso sites in zzso and showed that zzso of these zzso zzso zzso recruitment to zzso zzso We also found that both zzso zzso activity and its zzso are critical for promoting DNA repair and cellular recovery from DNA zzso Our data reveal an important role for zzso in zzso repair by HR, thereby providing a possible molecular basis for its tumor zzso zzso
