The zzso cell division cycle is a tightly regulated series of events coordinated by the periodic zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds have demonstrated zzso zzso with zzso agents in solid tumor zzso An improved understanding of how zzso regulate the DNA damage response now provides an opportunity for zzso of combinations of zzso zzso and DNA damaging chemotherapy agents that can be translated to clinical zzso 

Here, we discuss novel work uncovering multiple roles for zzso in the zzso zzso First, they activate DNA damage checkpoint and repair zzso Later their activity is turned off, resulting in cell cycle arrest, allowing time for DNA repair to zzso Recent clinical data on zzso zzso agent combinations are also zzso 

Readers will learn about novel areas of zzso biology, the complexity of DNA damage signaling networks and clinical zzso 

New data demonstrate that zzso are zzso regulators of DNA damage checkpoint and repair zzso zzso zzso may therefore provide a means of zzso the clinical activity of zzso zzso agents for the treatment of zzso
