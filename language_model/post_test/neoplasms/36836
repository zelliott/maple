Clinical evaluation of CT zzso and comparison with conventional CT guidance for monitoring of zzso zzso biopsy zzso 

20 zzso zzso biopsy procedures were zzso performed either with CT zzso or with conventional CT zzso CT zzso was performed using 120 zzso and 50, 70 or 90 zzso at a zzso of three or six images per zzso Number of zzso and zzso procedure times, radiation doses and zzso results were analyzed separately for conventional CT guidance and for CT zzso 

With CT zzso yield of zzso was improved zzso zzso zzso zzso and procedure times were shorter than for conventional CT guidance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso Analysis of procedure related radiation exposure and zzso outcome showed no significant difference between conventional and zzso zzso procedures zzso zzso zzso zzso 

CT zzso zzso guidance of zzso biopsy zzso Compared to conventional CT assistance, procedure times are decreased while yield of zzso is zzso
