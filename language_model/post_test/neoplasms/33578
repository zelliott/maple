A basic problem in treatment planning is the selection of weights for a set of beams which will yield the largest tumor dose under constraints limiting the doses received in specified zzso of different normal tissue zzso This report describes a method for zzso and solving this zzso problem as a zzso linear zzso An illustration is provided by a problem in planning treatment of a zzso zzso in which no more than 1/2 or 2/3 of the lung is permitted to receive greater than 20 zzso and no part of the spinal zzso allowed to receive greater than 45 zzso The zzso technique was applied to this example to determine how the maximum tumor dose is affected by changes in the normal tissue constraints and the addition of a tumor dose zzso zzso The linear programming technique yielded a rigorous and efficient determination of the beam weights for the zzso plan zzso An exhaustive zzso of all the underlying linear programs allows problems of moderate dimensions to be zzso while developments in mathematical programming and computer processing suggest approaches to problems of greater zzso
