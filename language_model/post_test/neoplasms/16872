Previously, we reported on the resistance to zzso zzso of tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell lines were established, from tumors both sensitive and resistant to zzso The cultured cells obtained from the parent tumor were designated zzso and those from a zzso resistant tumor zzso In zzso dose response studies showed a difference in zzso sensitivity with a resistance factor of approximately 20 at a relative survival of the tumor cells of 50 zzso The resistance factor was determined both in an zzso with continuous zzso exposure for 72 zzso and in a zzso zzso after an exposure for 1 h to various zzso of zzso The zzso cells showed zzso in zzso and in zzso to the currently used zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso was also observed against the recently developed zzso compound zzso In addition, the cell line zzso was resistant to other drugs interacting with DNA, such as zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso zzso For two non zzso drugs, zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso both cell lines were equally zzso
