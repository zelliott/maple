The zzso zzso zzso of human tumors prevents the even distribution of systemic drugs within cancer zzso However, techniques for studying vascular delivery systems in zzso often require complex zzso models and zzso surgical zzso The developing chicken zzso is a well-established model for human cancer that is easily accessible for tumor zzso To assess this model for the in zzso analysis of tumor zzso human tumors were grown on the zzso membrane zzso a thin vascular membrane which zzso the growing chick zzso The real-time movement of small fluorescent zzso through the tumor zzso and surrounding zzso were used to measure vascular leak within tumor zzso zzso zzso within tumor sites was selectively enhanced an zzso zzso zzso zzso or vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso treatment increased vascular leak in the tumor core relative to surrounding normal tissue and increased zzso zzso in human tumor zzso This new system easily zzso vascular zzso changes in zzso and suggests that vascular zzso may be manipulated to improve zzso targeting to zzso
