Fetal cell zzso is defined as the persistence of fetal cells in the mother after birth without any apparent zzso Fetal zzso cells zzso zzso into the maternal bone zzso for decades after delivery and are able to migrate to blood and zzso This phenomenon was hypothesized to have a zzso role in zzso diseases, but data are still controversial and zzso In zzso tumors, fetal cell zzso has been zzso to have a positive effect on tumor burden, although some evidence suggests that zzso may be involved in zzso zzso At the peripheral level, circulating zzso are less frequently detected in patients with zzso cancer, breast cancer or other solid, zzso zzso than in healthy individuals, which suggests a protective role for fetal cell zzso In zzso zzso have been found in tumor sections from zzso such as zzso breast, zzso lung zzso and zzso and have been shown to differentiate into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso differentiation have been zzso to have a role in destroying the zzso whereas zzso and zzso cells could participate in repair zzso zzso cells, on the other hand, are believed to play a part in tumor zzso This Review provides an overview of the role of fetal cell zzso in zzso and benign or zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the mechanisms by which fetal cell zzso is believed to zzso the protection against cancer or tumor progression will be discussed, together with future research zzso
