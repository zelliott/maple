The relative contribution of zzso zzso to zzso of zzso T cells in complex systems where zzso and zzso cells respond and cooperate together is not zzso We previously found that zzso expressed on zzso zzso T cells controls their initial persistence when zzso transferred in zzso and is required for delayed tumor zzso We now show that zzso stimulation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso its ability to suppress the growth of new as well as established tumors, zzso with marked expansion of zzso transferred zzso T zzso zzso zzso strongly enhanced the number of tumor zzso zzso T zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of zzso T cells was prevented in animals lacking zzso class II or depleted of zzso cells and did not occur in zzso animals receiving zzso zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso cells are the major target of zzso zzso These results suggest that while zzso signaling to a zzso T cell can control its expansion, zzso expressed on zzso cells strongly influences zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso therefore represents an important signal for allowing effective cooperation between zzso and zzso cells and for promoting cell interplay and tumor rejection where zzso activity is zzso
