Alternative zzso and zzso regulation are both mechanisms of zzso regulation of gene zzso Alternative zzso often results in zzso zzso with the same coding sequence but different lengths of zzso while zzso regulate gene expression by binding to specific zzso zzso In this sense, different zzso of an zzso may be zzso regulated by zzso sometimes resulting in cellular proliferation and this mechanism is being speculated on as a potential cause for cancer zzso
