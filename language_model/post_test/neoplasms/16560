While regulating a wide variety of zzso responses, the precise zzso functions of zzso zzso T cells are not well zzso zzso In zzso zzso of human zzso T cell clones results in the zzso of multiple zzso important for the recruitment and differentiation of zzso zzso cells zzso Once zzso these DC strongly activate zzso T zzso In humans, zzso is expressed by zzso DC and on tumor cells of this zzso Another specialized zzso zzso presenting cell, the zzso zzso seen in zzso zzso also expresses zzso Because zzso DC are important regulators of zzso T cell responses, cross talk between human zzso T cells and zzso DC would be expected to have significant impact on many immune zzso zzso with this hypothesis, zzso T cells are required for zzso zzso zzso responses in mice, and regulate diabetes in zzso diabetic zzso mouse by locally controlling the frequency and function of DC zzso Thus, regulation of zzso DC by zzso T cells controls both the transition from innate to zzso immunity and the zzso of subsequent T cell zzso
