zzso activity caused by the short-term administration of zzso zzso has been zzso in rats fed on a zzso diet as a reference model versus rats fed on a standard diet as zzso For 5 weeks groups of 20 rats, fed either on the zzso or standard diet, were treated simultaneously with zzso A group of 10 zzso rats remained zzso zzso application of zzso was followed by the appearance of zzso zzso in the skin, which were more evident in the zzso zzso No deaths occurred during the zzso After 5 zzso zzso treatment the rats were killed and zzso analyses were zzso zzso from the skin, liver, heart, zzso lung and zzso were screened by conventional zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso and zzso control rats presented tissue zzso although to a different zzso The zzso zzso rats showed no such zzso zzso rats treated with zzso developed significant zzso zzso zzso and extended zzso zzso particularly in the skin, accompanied by a significant increase in the thickness of collagen zzso value: zzso zzso compared to the control zzso group zzso zzso zzso The overall results provide objective proof of zzso activity after 5 zzso treatment with zzso Such a fast response is interpreted as being linked to the increased vulnerability of the membrane caused by zzso zzso which would more readily facilitate the toxic activity of zzso zzso
