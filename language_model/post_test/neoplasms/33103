zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be zzso in zzso and has raised safety concerns regarding the use of zzso agents zzso to treat zzso in cancer zzso To investigate the potential for zzso to be zzso in zzso we have evaluated human zzso for amplification of the zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and expression of surface zzso zzso Gene amplification analysis of zzso solid zzso found that amplification of the zzso locus was rare with zzso similar to other zzso zzso transcript levels in zzso and zzso cell lines were low in comparison with bone zzso and were equivalent to, or lower than, levels in normal zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was detected in some zzso lines, no zzso could be detected on the cell surface using zzso binding zzso This may be due to the lack of zzso protein expression or lack of zzso factors, such as zzso Taken together, we have found no evidence that zzso is zzso in zzso or gets to the surface of zzso zzso This suggests that there is no selective advantage for zzso to zzso zzso and questions the functional relevance of zzso gene zzso in zzso
