Although most zzso zzso mass zzso come equipped with vacuum zzso laser zzso zzso sources, the atmospheric pressure zzso zzso source is an attractive option because of its ability to be coupled to a wide range of zzso This article describes the use of an zzso source coupled to a zzso mass zzso for evaluation of the effects of zzso and long-term storage on zzso profiles of zzso serum samples from healthy zzso zzso were zzso using zzso beads either from fresh zzso or after serum storage at zzso for 18 months or at zzso for 8 zzso Data were zzso using newly developed zzso tools and then were subjected to statistical analysis and class zzso The analyses showed a dramatic effect of storage on the abundance of several peptides such as zzso A and B, complement zzso zzso and zzso indicated by other authors as disease zzso Most of these results were confirmed by shadow zzso analysis, able to zzso each sample in the correct zzso In addition to demonstrating the suitability of the zzso technique for zzso profiling studies, our data are of relevance for retrospective studies that involve frozen zzso stored for many years in zzso
