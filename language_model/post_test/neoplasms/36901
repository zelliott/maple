We have used the zzso zzso system as described previously to evaluate the zzso of controlled gene expression in cancer gene zzso As a model zzso we used the human zzso zzso zzso which has been placed under the zzso control of the zzso Human melanoma cells were zzso by two modified zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso regulatory unit and the zzso gene driven by the zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso expression in the target cells was stable over several zzso zzso production was in the range of 40 zzso zzso zzso A fine tuning of zzso expression could be achieved by zzso the zzso cells with increasing doses of zzso zzso a concentration of 500 zzso zzso in the culture medium zzso zzso zzso Most zzso for clinical application, zzso expression by the zzso melanoma cells could also be regulated in zzso When zzso mice were zzso with the zzso tumor cells, they failed to develop zzso Instead, the zzso of zzso expression in the zzso tumor cells by oral administration of zzso led to subcutaneous tumor zzso this growth rate was comparable with the growth rate of zzso zzso zzso parental zzso The finding demonstrates the zzso of the zzso system in cancer gene zzso
