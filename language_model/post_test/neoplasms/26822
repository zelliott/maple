zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso of zzso has been traditionally used as a culinary ingredient due to its pleasant aroma and zzso In addition to this role, studies on zzso have demonstrated cancer zzso potential in in zzso and in zzso zzso Nevertheless, the precise zzso nature of naturally occurring zzso compounds in zzso has still not been fully zzso 

In this study, an effort has been made to identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso targets of zzso zzso principles zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by employing a dual reverse virtual screening zzso zzso proven target information of the zzso principles was zzso from zzso databases and compared with the virtually screened set of targets to evaluate the reliability of the zzso zzso To study the molecular interaction pattern of the zzso action, molecular zzso simulation was performed with Auto zzso zzso zzso studies of binding pose of zzso with zzso 3 were conducted to obtain an insight into the interacting zzso acids and their zzso zzso 

A zzso list of target proteins associated with multiple forms of cancer and ranked by their Fit zzso zzso zzso and descending zzso score zzso Screen zzso were obtained from the two independent inverse screening zzso zzso zzso studies exploring the zzso principle targeted action revealed that zzso bonds and zzso interactions forms the chief contributing factor in zzso interactions associated with zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso 3 with a specific framework that is zzso for zzso attacks by polar zzso inside the zzso 3 zzso zzso 

This study revealed vital information about the zzso zzso zzso of essential oils in zzso In addition, a zzso set of zzso targets for zzso was generated, which can be further confirmed by in zzso and in zzso zzso
