We developed a novel zzso contrast agent for the structural and functional imaging of zzso The contrast agent was zzso by zzso zzso green zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso using a modified zzso zzso More stabilized zzso and zzso zzso characteristics were observed for zzso and plasma suspensions of zzso zzso The technical feasibility of concurrent structural and functional imaging was demonstrated through a series of zzso tests in which the zzso suspension of zzso zzso was injected into a transparent tube embedded in an zzso phantom at different flow rates and zzso zzso zzso imaging and zzso ultrasound imaging successfully captured the changes of zzso flow rate and concentration with high zzso and zzso One potential application of the proposed zzso zzso zzso is for the identification and characterization of zzso zzso for enhanced zzso between tumor structural and functional boundaries in zzso zzso diffuse optical zzso
