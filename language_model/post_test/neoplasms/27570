zzso zzso are zzso signaling molecules that evoke a variety of zzso They are best known as potent promoters of zzso Normally, zzso are produced primarily by zzso As a result, current models regarding the production of zzso in the context of disease focus on the zzso as the site of zzso zzso cells, including zzso cells, are typically relegated to supportive zzso It is recognized that zzso cells normally contain all the components necessary for zzso synthesis except the zzso zzso zzso There is accumulating evidence that some populations of zzso cells normally express low levels of zzso and can zzso zzso zzso Moreover, certain factors, including bacterial and viral infection, can promote the expression of zzso in zzso gastrointestinal and skin zzso zzso The appearance of active zzso zzso in zzso cells at these sites may contribute to diseases like cancer, colitis and zzso This paper reviews the state of our knowledge regarding the expression of zzso in zzso cells, the factors that modify that zzso and the implications regarding zzso
