zzso zzso results in a functional zzso of parental zzso presumably by zzso modification of the zzso and is required for normal zzso zzso In general, zzso zzso are observed in zzso containing zzso in the dosage of parental zzso for example where both copies of zzso or zzso regions are derived from one zzso These zzso indicate that zzso of maternal zzso inhibit embryonic growth and proliferation whereas zzso of the paternal zzso result in enhanced cell growth and zzso zzso in the dosage of parental zzso have recently been observed in some forms of zzso zzso in zzso Here we discuss the role and possible mechanisms of zzso zzso during zzso and attempt to draw parallels between the parental origin of the loss of zzso observed in some human zzso and the zzso zzso that arise in mice with similar zzso of parental zzso These observations strongly zzso zzso zzso in the genesis of some forms of zzso and, more generally, in the genetic predisposition to zzso
