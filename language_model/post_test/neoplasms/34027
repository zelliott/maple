In spite of the impressive progress in diagnosis, surgery and therapy that occurred since the zzso the overall cancer mortality is still high and the medical need is largely zzso A number of innovative strategies, aimed to target zzso abnormalities of tumor cells are in development and begin to give important zzso In alternative, zzso zzso has been addressed with the aim to limit the tumor ability to grow and zzso However, it will likely take some years to fully define the therapeutic role of different innovative zzso zzso zzso drugs will continue to represent a chief part of the therapy in the forthcoming years, possibly in combination with innovative agents addressing molecular zzso Most important traditional zzso drugs or zzso zzso agents were derived from natural sources also through synthetic structural zzso In the zzso zzso and zzso represented important success stories of this approach, while among DNA interacting agents zzso continued to represent a structural platform for discovering new drugs and DNA minor groove zzso represented a new field of zzso zzso chemistry combined with zzso screening programs are an important source of totally synthetic new agents, however, it should not be disregarded the fact that nature already performed zzso chemistry and leads selection through the zzso New natural or zzso agents acting as zzso zzso or DNA interactive agents of various mechanisms of action are presently investigated and will probably continue to give important contribution to cancer therapy in the near zzso In this review, the medicinal chemistry and the development status of these zzso zzso agents are focused and zzso
