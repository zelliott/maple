As there is little evidence of pollution affecting the health of fish and shellfish on a global scale, this paper attempts to put into perspective the zzso disease relationship by reviewing examples of studies and reports in the historic and current zzso Although there is no dispute that pollution can affect the aquatic organisms under laboratory conditions and may be responsible for the decline of populations of such animals in some inland waters and some zzso most of the evidence for pollution causing or increasing disease in fish in open waters is zzso Historical data proves that almost all fish and shellfish diseases known today have been described since the end of the last zzso However, it is also known that water pollution, especially in inland waters, has for the past zzso years been the result of zzso and zzso This has resulted in some major rivers becoming devoid of or deficient in fish zzso The concern that pollution may influence the health status of fish and shellfish stocks has increased over the past 20 zzso zzso attention was paid to zzso diseases, including zzso in zzso fish, and zzso diseases in zzso in the heavily zzso zzso and zzso in North zzso As the interest in this subject spread, it became political, and often controversial, especially amongst the North Sea zzso The disagreements have largely been settled amongst scientists because international bodies, such as the International Council for zzso of the Sea zzso established workshops to investigate sampling methods and zzso zzso zzso from those workshops have contributed to some form of zzso for field work and the subject, although largely zzso has some objective approaches which are zzso As there are zzso interacting biological and physical influences in the aquatic environment, it is difficult to establish the background zzso of diseases in populations of fish and zzso Examples of the influences of zzso changes are zzso and these show that short-term zzso can be directly zzso However, a more long-term problem is water zzso resulting largely from anthropogenic zzso In parts of zzso this has, and is, leading to decimation of fish stocks in inland zzso In general, diseases in fish and shellfish are very zzso but there is concern amongst scientists that certain zzso especially liver zzso occurring in zzso fish inhabiting zzso zzso and coastal waters, are related to the release of zzso zzso zzso pesticides and heavy zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
