The zzso zzso zzso member zzso is best known for its important role in zzso immunity but is also recognized as a zzso marker on a number of zzso and zzso zzso In this article, we describe a novel human zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso with properties that suggest a potential utility against zzso that express zzso 

The fully human zzso zzso was generated using human zzso transgenic mice and characterized by zzso and functional zzso in zzso Severe combined zzso zzso mice zzso with human zzso zzso cells were administered zzso to investigate direct zzso zzso A pilot study of zzso was conducted in zzso primates to assess zzso 

zzso binds with high affinity and specificity to human and zzso zzso and competes with zzso zzso zzso activates T cells only in combination with zzso zzso stimulation and does not induce proliferation of primary zzso tumor zzso zzso significantly enhanced the survival of zzso mice bearing zzso or zzso tumors, which may be zzso through direct zzso mechanisms such as zzso cellular zzso zzso administration of up to 10 zzso of zzso to zzso monkeys was well tolerated without evidence of significant toxicity or depletion of circulating zzso 

zzso the data suggest that the human zzso zzso which has recently entered clinical development under the name zzso may provide direct zzso activity against zzso zzso or zzso independent of its potential to enhance immunity through its zzso zzso
