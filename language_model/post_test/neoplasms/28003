The growth of human tumors and development of zzso depend on the de zzso formation of blood zzso The formation of new blood vessels is tightly regulated by specific growth factors that target zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso zzso have been implicated as the key zzso zzso factor signaling zzso required for pathological zzso including tumor zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso blocks new blood vessel formation in growing tumors, leading to stasis or zzso of tumor zzso Advances in understanding the biology of zzso have led to the development of several therapeutic zzso for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso A number of these zzso are under investigation in clinical studies to evaluate their potential to treat human zzso
