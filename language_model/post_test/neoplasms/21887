A requirement of nuclear processes that use DNA as a zzso is the manipulation of zzso in which the DNA is zzso zzso modifications cause zzso of zzso and DNA, and result in a zzso zzso environment for these nuclear zzso Recent advances in the fields of DNA repair and zzso reveal that both zzso modifications and zzso complexes are essential for the repair of DNA zzso such as DNA double strand breaks zzso In particular, zzso complexes, such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes are implicated in DNA zzso The activity of these zzso complexes influences the efficiency of the DNA repair process, which ultimately affects zzso integrity and zzso Thus, the process of DNA repair requires the cooperative activities of zzso zzso zzso complexes that facilitate the dynamic zzso zzso needed during repair of DNA zzso
