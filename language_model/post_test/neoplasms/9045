zzso of zzso drugs improves their therapeutic zzso by virtue of the enhanced zzso and retention effect which achieves passive targeting of zzso in zzso This effect can be significantly enhanced by active targeting of zzso to zzso Numerous zzso have been proposed and used in various studies with peptides being considered attractive alternatives to zzso This is further reinforced by the availability of zzso zzso display libraries which offer an unlimited zzso of zzso zzso In particular landscape zzso with zzso display of zzso peptides which enable the zzso particle itself to become a zzso creates a paradigm for high zzso selection of zzso setting the stage for personalized cancer zzso Despite its promise, this zzso of zzso chemistry and zzso has not made a significant clinical impact in cancer management due to a lack of using robust processes that facilitate zzso and zzso To this end we proposed the use of zzso fusion protein as the navigating zzso of novel targeted zzso platforms which are described in this zzso
