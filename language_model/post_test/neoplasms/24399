Treatment of cancer is increasingly more effective but is associated with short and long-term side zzso zzso side effects remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to prevent zzso One of these side effects is oral zzso zzso zzso 

To evaluate the effectiveness of zzso agents for oral zzso in patients with cancer receiving treatment, compared with other potentially active interventions, zzso or no zzso 

The Cochrane zzso Health Group Trials zzso the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors of eligible studies were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional zzso Date of most recent zzso April zzso 

Trials were selected if they met the following criteria: design - random allocation of zzso participants - anyone with cancer receiving chemotherapy or zzso treatment for zzso interventions - agents prescribed to prevent oral zzso outcomes - prevention of zzso pain, amount of zzso zzso systemic infection, length of zzso cost and patient quality of zzso 

Information regarding methods, participants, interventions and outcome measures and results were independently zzso in zzso by two review zzso Authors were contacted for details of zzso and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried zzso The Cochrane zzso Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and risk ratios zzso calculated using zzso zzso 

Two hundred and two studies were zzso One hundred and thirty two were excluded for various reasons, usually as there was no zzso information on zzso Of the 71 zzso studies all had data for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evaluated were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso beta zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ice chips, zzso zzso zzso zzso oral care, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zinc zzso Of the 29 interventions included in trials, 10 showed some evidence of a benefit (albeit sometimes zzso for either preventing or reducing the severity of zzso zzso where there was more than one trial in the zzso finding a significant difference when compared with a zzso or no treatment were: zzso which provided minimal benefit in preventing moderate and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso paste or zzso demonstrated a moderate benefit in preventing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso reduced moderate and severe zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and ice chips prevented zzso at all levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Other interventions showing some benefit with only one study were: zzso calcium zzso zzso oral care zzso zzso and zinc zzso The number needed to treat zzso to prevent one patient experiencing moderate or severe zzso over a baseline zzso of zzso for zzso is 10 zzso zzso 7 to zzso zzso paste or zzso 13 zzso zzso 8 to zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 3 to 6) and ice chips 5 zzso zzso 3 to zzso When the baseline zzso is zzso the zzso for zzso are zzso for zzso paste or zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and for ice chips zzso The general reporting of zzso was zzso However, the assessments of the quality of the zzso improved when the authors provided additional zzso 

Several of the interventions were found to have some benefit at preventing or reducing the severity of zzso associated with cancer zzso The strength of the evidence was variable and implications for practice include consideration that benefits may be specific for certain cancer types and zzso There is a need for well designed and conducted trials with sufficient numbers of participants to perform zzso analyses by type of disease and zzso zzso
