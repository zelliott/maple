A number of basic research and clinical studies have led to the hypothesis that oral zzso may improve the survival of patients with cancer through an zzso effect in addition to their zzso zzso 

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral zzso (including vitamin K zzso and zzso as an intervention to improve survival of patients with zzso 

A comprehensive search for studies of zzso in cancer patients including zzso a January 2007 electronic search of the following zzso Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso zzso zzso the Web of zzso zzso hand search of the American Society of Clinical Oncology zzso with its first volume, 1982) and of the American Society of zzso zzso with its 2003 zzso zzso checking of references of included zzso and zzso use of zzso zzso feature in zzso 

zzso clinical trials zzso comparing vitamin K zzso or zzso to no intervention or zzso in cancer patients without clinical evidence of zzso zzso 

Using a standardized data form we extracted data on zzso quality, participants, interventions and outcome of interest that included all cause zzso symptomatic deep zzso zzso symptomatic pulmonary zzso major bleeding and minor zzso 

Of zzso identified citations five zzso fulfilled the inclusion zzso zzso was the oral zzso in all of these zzso and it was compared to either zzso or no zzso The overall zzso quality of these zzso was zzso The effect of zzso on reduction in mortality was not statistically significant at six months zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso at one year zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso at 2 years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or at five years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso In the zzso of patients with small cell lung cancer zzso zzso reduced mortality at six months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not at one year zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso This six month mortality benefit was statistically significant in the zzso of extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not in the zzso of limited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso One study assessed the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and showed a zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased both major bleeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and minor bleeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso increased the risk of major bleeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and minor bleeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso also in patients with zzso There was no evidence for a significant reduction in mortality in any other cancer zzso 

zzso evidence does not suggest a mortality benefit from oral zzso in patients with zzso In patients with zzso the evidence suggests a survival benefit at six months from zzso particularly when the disease is zzso The decision for a patient with extensive zzso to start zzso for survival benefit should balance that benefit with the zzso of increased bleeding risk in light of patient values for these zzso
