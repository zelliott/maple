After successful treatment of zzso in childhood, the occurrence of second zzso zzso zzso came to the zzso Few studies have considered the relationship between the radiation dose received and the risk of developing an zzso To take into account the zzso of the dose distribution so as to evaluate the overall risk of an zzso after a childhood cancer, we therefore focused on the integral dose restricted to the zzso zzso 

The study was performed in a cohort of zzso patients who were zzso survivors of all types of childhood cancer treated between 1947 and 1986 in France and Great zzso For each patient, the integral dose was estimated for the volume inside the beam zzso 

We found a significant zzso relationship between the overall risk of an zzso and the estimated integral zzso The excess relative risk for each incremental unit of the integral dose was only zzso in a linear model and zzso when a negative exponential term was considered, when adjusted for zzso The risk of zzso occurrence was zzso times higher in the case of zzso However among patients who had received zzso only those who had received the highest integral dose actually had a higher zzso 

The integral dose in our study cannot be considered as a good predictor of later zzso However other studies with the same study design are obviously needed to evaluate the use of the integral dose as a tool for decision making concerning different zzso zzso
