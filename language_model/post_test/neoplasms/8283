zzso administration of zzso zzso and the formation of its zzso zzso zzso may be associated with high zzso and zzso zzso zzso we evaluated the plasma zzso and urine recovery of zzso administered on three different schedules as part of phase I and phase II zzso 

In phase I schedule A, zzso was administered orally daily for 5 days per week for 2 weeks repeated every 4 zzso On phase I schedule B, zzso was administered daily for 14 days repeated every 4 zzso In Phase II, zzso was administered daily for 5 days during 8 weeks (one zzso zzso blood samples were obtained on day 1 and day 10 or 11 for phase I studies, and day 1 and day 50 for the phase II zzso Recovery of zzso and zzso in urine was evaluated on day 1 and day 10 or 11 in the phase I zzso Area under the zzso and zzso plasma concentration vs time zzso from 0 to 24 h zzso zzso were calculated using zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso h values on day 1 at the maximum tolerated dose of schedules A and B zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the phase II dose zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso h values at these same doses of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The ratios of zzso zzso zzso h on day 10 or 11 to day 1 on phase I A and B were zzso and zzso respectively, and the ratios zzso zzso zzso h on day 10 or 11 to day 1 on phase I A and B were zzso and zzso zzso The recovery of zzso and zzso in the urine was zzso 

There was significant zzso and zzso zzso in the disposition of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso undergo primarily zzso zzso
