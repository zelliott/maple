The zzso zzso of zzso are characterized by large zzso zzso in systemic drug exposure zzso and drug zzso The zzso zzso is thought to be largely related to differences in the zzso function of zzso involved in zzso metabolism and zzso As zzso in efficacy and toxicity is associated with zzso in zzso zzso and zzso reducing zzso zzso zzso may help improve the zzso ratio of zzso zzso We investigated if high-dose zzso a potent zzso zzso could result in a uniform reduction of zzso clearance and reduce the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso 

Seven patients were treated in a zzso over design with intravenous zzso zzso zzso followed 3 weeks later by zzso (15 zzso given in combination with orally administered zzso zzso zzso 3 times daily, up to 47 hours after zzso zzso or vice zzso zzso plasma zzso data were described by a zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso data were described by a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso clearance was reduced by 50% zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso albeit with large zzso zzso zzso change in zzso range zzso - zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso in clearance and zzso expressed as zzso of variation, was increased from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso respectively, and not, as we had hypothesized, zzso 

zzso of zzso by zzso high-dose zzso administration does not result in a uniform reduction of zzso clearance and does not reduce the zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso This approach is zzso as method to achieve a uniform zzso zzso zzso
