This study explores the significance of zzso outcomes for predicting length of survival of zzso cancer zzso 

Patients were recruited upon admission to the zzso zzso care zzso Weekly assessment of 180 terminal cancer patients was carried out throughout their survival time using the Medical zzso Study zzso zzso Health Survey, the Taiwanese version of the zzso Anderson zzso zzso zzso the zzso Performance zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso equations zzso were zzso to analyze whether the zzso outcomes predicted survival zzso 

Of all patients, 64 had one assessment, 51 had two, 25 had three, and 40 had four or more zzso up to a maximum of zzso The zzso analysis showed that gender zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the physical component summary score zzso zzso zzso the zzso total score zzso zzso zzso composite fatigue severity zzso zzso zzso and composite pain severity zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with length of zzso The zzso analysis showed that gender zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso total score zzso zzso zzso were significant zzso of survival zzso 

This is the first study to explore the significance of zzso outcomes for predicting length of survival of zzso cancer patients using the zzso zzso This study confirms that overall symptom severity is a significant factor in assessing the length of survival of zzso cancer zzso
