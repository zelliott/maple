We have developed a magnetic resonance imaging zzso method for improved detection of cancer with a new class of zzso contrast agents, containing zzso zzso organic zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso compounds have been found to accumulate within cells, where they interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are metabolically active and highly zzso an zzso contrast agent that enters cells with high zzso activity could provide high-resolution functional images of tumor boundaries and internal structure, which cannot be achieved by conventional contrast zzso The present work demonstrates properties of zzso that may give it excellent specificity for cancer zzso A high dose of zzso did not cause any acute or short-term adverse reactions in zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods demonstrate that zzso is a blood pool agent that binds to serum zzso with a zzso constant K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M and a binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to its prolonged blood zzso and selective leakage from zzso tumor zzso a low dose of zzso zzso zzso selectively enhanced in zzso magnetic resonance images of tumors, providing high-resolution images of their interior zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso zzso accumulates in cancer zzso Although zzso has a lower zzso than zzso zzso contrast agents, its specificity for highly zzso cells may lead to an innovative approach to cancer detection since it has the potential to produce zzso contrast agents that are nontoxic and highly sensitive to cancer zzso
