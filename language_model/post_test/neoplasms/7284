The activity of an zzso of alkaline zzso zzso was measured in serum samples obtained from zzso individual zzso The median zzso concentration in patients with zzso or zzso cancer zzso zzso was zzso higher than in hospitalized control patients with illnesses other than cancer zzso zzso and zzso higher than in healthy control subjects zzso zzso Among patients with either breast or zzso cancer who were clinically disease free following their initial therapy, the median zzso concentration zzso zzso was intermediate between the median zzso concentration in patients with zzso or zzso cancer and that of healthy control zzso In order to illustrate the potential clinical application of zzso as a diagnostic cancer marker, we have selected a serum zzso concentration of zzso zzso as a reference value above which only zzso of healthy control subjects would have a zzso zzso zzso this reference value, zzso of the patients in the present study with zzso or zzso cancer would have a positive zzso test, whereas only zzso of hospitalized patients with illnesses other than cancer would have a positive zzso These data suggest that zzso may be equivalent to the zzso zzso as a diagnostic cancer zzso
