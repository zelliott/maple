We investigated whether increasing the patients' processed blood volume zzso during peripheral blood stem cell collection zzso from four to five times leads to a greater yield of zzso zzso We also studied the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and compared the amount of zzso cells with zzso 

All patients ( zzso received chemotherapy followed by zzso for zzso zzso zzso from the patients' peripheral blood and the zzso harvests were taken after processing zzso zzso and 5 times the patients' calculated zzso 

The mean total yields of zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso body weight, zzso The mean increase for these zzso between zzso and 5 zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the mean number of zzso zzso zzso planned courses of high-dose chemotherapy zzso per patient, the mean yield of zzso cells per zzso body weight and intended course of zzso after zzso and 5 zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso ( zzso Twenty zzso were zzso for zzso There was some correlation between the number of zzso zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso ( r zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso ( r zzso zzso zzso zzso No toxicity occurred during zzso although the mean zzso count dropped by 50% which must be kept in mind regarding the additional application of zzso and the fact that most patients had large zzso zzso 

zzso 4 zzso is sufficient to collect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body weight and intended course of zzso in most patients, although extension to 5 zzso further increases the total yield of zzso zzso
