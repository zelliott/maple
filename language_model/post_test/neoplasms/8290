Using zzso analysis of zzso factor occupancy, we investigated the mechanisms underlying three zzso growth arrest pathways that require the zzso tumor zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso zzso repress a common set of genes under each growth arrest condition and showed that growth arrest is achieved through repression of a core set of genes involved not only in cell cycle control but also zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso predicted the existence of nuclear respiratory zzso zzso binding sites in zzso target zzso and zzso factor binding analysis confirmed our zzso We showed that zzso a factor known to regulate expression of genes involved in zzso function, is a zzso of a large number of zzso target zzso Our studies provide insights into zzso regulatory circuitry, suggest how factor occupancy can predict the expression signature of a given target zzso and reveal pathways zzso in human zzso
