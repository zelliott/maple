zzso differentiation factor zzso is an zzso protein produced by the zzso with no definitive zzso zzso is zzso into the zzso and targets the breast and zzso suggesting that it has an zzso zzso Initially, zzso was indirectly discovered based on the differentiation effect of alkaline zzso extracts of the zzso tumor zzso on zzso rat zzso tumor zzso Years later, the zzso clone responsible for this differentiation activity was isolated from a human zzso zzso library using expression zzso The zzso zzso a zzso zzso that had differentiation activity on zzso breast cancer cells and on zzso prostate cancer cells in zzso and in zzso Recently, our group focused on identification of the zzso zzso zzso As potential zzso candidates, we identified the members of the Heat zzso zzso family of proteins zzso in both zzso and zzso human breast cancer cells zzso and zzso zzso and zzso human prostate cancer cells zzso but not in zzso cells, zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso or zzso zzso Here we review the current advances on zzso with particular focus on the structural investigation of its zzso and on its functional effects on breast and prostate zzso
