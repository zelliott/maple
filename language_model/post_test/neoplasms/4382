In order to accomplish the transition from avascular to vascular growth, solid zzso zzso a zzso substance known as zzso zzso factor zzso into the surrounding zzso zzso zzso cells respond to this zzso stimulus in a zzso sequence of events zzso at zzso of a degradation of their basement zzso migration and zzso A mathematical model is presented which takes into account two of the most important events associated with the zzso cells as they form zzso sprouts and make their way towards the zzso zzso cell migration and zzso The zzso simulations of the model compare very well with the actual experimental zzso We subsequently investigate the model zzso by making some relevant biological zzso The mathematical analysis helps to clarify the particular contributions to the model of the two independent processes of zzso cell migration and zzso
