zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso proteins designated zzso zzso proteins zzso diverse functions, acting as cell surface zzso molecules and zzso adapter zzso Early reports demonstrated that zzso is largely restricted to the zzso zzso and is involved in cell cycle control, via a regulatory interaction with the zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso 2 zzso Here we describe the expression pattern of zzso in peripheral blood cells using gene expression zzso technology, and in normal zzso and adult human zzso as well as adult human zzso using tissue zzso zzso Using zzso zzso to evaluate zzso zzso all peripheral blood cell types demonstrated very low levels of zzso zzso however, zzso expression was greatest in zzso compared to zzso which showed lower levels of zzso zzso Very weak zzso expression is found in zzso zzso and B cells, but not in T cells, by lineage specific zzso cell flow zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso stimulation increases zzso protein expression in peripheral blood zzso over nearly zzso baseline zzso Western zzso and zzso studies show strong zzso expression in the developing zzso cells of human zzso zzso zzso studies on normal tissue zzso confirmed zzso expression in a subset of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and weak zzso in small numbers of cell types in zzso zzso Human zzso brain specimens from 19 to 31 zzso weeks showed that the zzso cells are zzso zone cells and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cortical plate, zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso analysis showed zzso expression in a wide variety of zzso including breast, prostate and zzso These findings warrant the further study of the role of zzso in the cell cycle of both zzso and zzso zzso
