The zzso gene is crucial for effective tumor suppression in humans as supported by its universal zzso in cancer cells either through zzso affecting the zzso locus directly or through aberration of its normal zzso The zzso tumor zzso is regulated through a negative feedback loop involving its zzso target zzso zzso is also an essential negative regulator of zzso Several zzso models have been proposed to simulate the dynamics of the zzso loop, but they do not include zzso only account for some basic interactions between zzso and zzso and cannot capture the intrinsic noise in the zzso In this article, we present a comprehensive model for the zzso loop that accounts for most known interactions among zzso zzso and zzso Our model is characterized by a set of molecular zzso which enables us to employ zzso simulation to investigate the dynamics of the zzso In agreement with experiments, our results show that zzso and zzso undergo zzso after DNA damage in the presence of noise, and the variation in zzso zzso is much higher than that in zzso zzso Our simulations predict that intrinsic noise contributes to zzso of the total variation in zzso zzso and zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso after treatment with zzso in our simulations are also consistent with experimental zzso Our simulation results further predict that zzso levels increase dramatically after zzso is knocked out, but increase with a much less amount after zzso is knocked zzso This may partially explain why zzso and zzso mouse zzso die in different zzso zzso Our zzso model and simulation provide insights into the zzso of the behavior of the zzso zzso and can be used to predict the dynamics of the zzso after certain zzso
