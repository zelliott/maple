To investigate the occurrence of symptomatic zzso zzso zzso in cancer patients, as well as that of cancer in zzso patients and to seek possible factors in the zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso data of patients with zzso in two general neurology clinics during a zzso period zzso were zzso zzso A zzso cancer registry was consulted for zzso data in the zzso 

The zzso population of the two clinics consisted of zzso people, and zzso new cancer patients were zzso zzso was diagnosed in zzso patients, of whom 74 suffered from cancer (in 56 zzso was believed to be related to zzso The crude relative risk of zzso in patients with cancer compared with patients without cancer was zzso After correction for differences in age and sex between the compared groups, the relative risk dropped to zzso zzso for women and zzso for zzso The crude relative risk of cancer for patients with zzso relative to people without zzso was zzso The relative risk, after correction for age and sex, was zzso zzso for women and zzso for zzso All relative risks were significant zzso zzso zzso but did not differ between the sexes zzso zzso zzso Weight loss was established in zzso patients, but in zzso it was zzso zzso has not been found to be part of a zzso zzso did not play a zzso zzso In some patients zzso preceded the diagnosis of zzso 

The occurrence of zzso seems to be higher in patients with cancer than in people without zzso Cancer was found in patients with zzso more often, particularly in elderly men, than would be expected from the occurrence in the total zzso zzso in patients with cancer is supposed to be due to a combination of zzso and mechanical zzso The findings justify a prospective study of the relation between zzso and zzso
