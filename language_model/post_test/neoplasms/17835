zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso are thought to mediate diverse biological functions such as cell growth, differentiation and zzso zzso zzso may affect zzso zzso which is essential for cellular zzso differentiation and zzso Data in this study show that zzso a newly identified novel zzso protein zzso was essential for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone in zzso zzso and zzso cancer cells effectively inhibited cellular zzso zzso cellular migration was significantly accelerated when cells were deficient in zzso zzso The mechanism underlying these phenomena might be due to zzso affected zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso blocked zzso effect produced by zzso but enhanced the migratory effect initiated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs are not only critical for the zzso zzso zzso but also for cell zzso Further studies found that zzso zzso regulated cell migration via zzso downstream zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular migration might involve zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data provide an unexpected role for zzso in tumor cell migration zzso
