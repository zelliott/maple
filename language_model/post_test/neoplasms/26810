Cancer is the number one cause of death in both zzso zzso in the understanding of cancer biology, the identification of zzso factors, and the development of new treatments are increasingly dependent on access to human cancer zzso with linked zzso zzso Access to human tumor samples and a large investment in zzso research are needed to advance this zzso The zzso tissue zzso provide researchers with biological materials, which are essential tools for cancer zzso 

zzso tissue zzso for research aim to zzso document and preserve human zzso from patients with zzso zzso This is in order to provide the highest quality and well zzso biological zzso used as essential tools to achieve the growing demands of scientific research zzso Such zzso are partners in zzso biomedical research and medical product development through clinical resources, in order to apply best options to the zzso 

Following Institutional Review Board approval and signing an zzso zzso zzso the tumor and zzso specimens are zzso by a designated pathologist at the operating room only when there is a sufficient amount of the zzso in excess of the routine zzso Blood samples are collected prior to the zzso Other types of specimens collected include zzso fluid, zzso zzso zzso for zzso Cutting zzso zzso and primary culture zzso zzso clinical, zzso and follow-up data are collected in a designated zzso zzso has already established several organ or zzso tissue zzso within different zzso 

The foundation of tissue zzso requires the concentrated effort of a multidisciplinary team composed of zzso medical and scientific zzso Research projects using these specimens facilitate the development of zzso zzso accelerate basic research aimed at clarifying molecular mechanisms involved in cancer, and support the development of novel diagnostic zzso
