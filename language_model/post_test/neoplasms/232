We have previously shown that zzso from many zzso patients zzso zzso zzso activity as measured by serum zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso cell zzso This zzso activity did not correlate with serum zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso did not stimulate zzso zzso The present study was, therefore, undertaken to investigate the zzso stimulating activity of zzso from patients with zzso zzso Studies were performed in 36 patients with various zzso zzso In these patients, serum zzso of zzso free zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In addition, zzso were incubated with zzso cells or zzso zzso cells in primary culture in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and medium zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso obtained from some patients with various zzso illness increased zzso zzso in culture media of zzso cells as well as that of zzso zzso zzso The zzso stimulating effects of zzso were not disease specific and significantly correlated zzso with serum zzso and T4 zzso zzso zzso zzso in these patients were within the normal range even by the newly developed zzso zzso Although the nature of zzso present in zzso of patients with low zzso syndrome which stimulates zzso zzso zzso is not entirely known, it is conceivable that there exist mechanisms independent of zzso to compensate the decreased serum zzso levels in low zzso zzso
