The ultimate target of pharmacological research is to find new drugs for treating human diseases such as zzso Agents causing differentiation and thus growth arrest should be particularly useful in this zzso A potential target for such zzso therapy is the zzso family protein zzso C zzso which is involved in the zzso of signals for cell zzso zzso and zzso Our recent work showing the induction of differentiation in melanoma cells by an zzso of one zzso zzso zzso touches on several important areas of investigation, which will form the basis of this zzso the role of individual zzso of zzso their downstream targets and their specific zzso the mechanism of zzso of specific genes involved in the differentiation process, and the molecular basis for the zzso changes associated with zzso The central role that zzso plays in these processes points to the need for a greater understanding of the zzso pathways zzso by individual zzso of this family of zzso
