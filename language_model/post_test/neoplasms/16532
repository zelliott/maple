The zzso are a maturing class of zzso zzso In this article, we review the pharmacology and zzso activity of the zzso zzso that are approved for clinical use and those zzso agents undergoing clinical zzso zzso is a naturally occurring zzso zzso that has a unique zzso target, zzso I, a nuclear zzso that reduces the zzso stress of zzso DNA during the zzso zzso transcription, and repair of zzso zzso and zzso are synthetic zzso designed to facilitate zzso administration of the active zzso form of the compound by introducing functional groups to enhance zzso They are now well-established components in the zzso management of several zzso zzso has modest activity in patients treated previously with zzso and small cell lung cancer and is currently approved for use in the United States as zzso therapy in these zzso zzso evidence of activity against zzso zzso is also zzso zzso is a zzso that zzso zzso conversion to the biologically active zzso zzso It is presently the treatment of choice when used in combination with zzso as zzso therapy for patients with advanced zzso cancer or as a single agent after failure of zzso zzso zzso preliminary results suggest that zzso may have an increasing role in the treatment of other solid tumors, including small and zzso cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, zzso cancer, gastric cancer, and zzso zzso Several additional zzso zzso are in various stages of clinical development, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Efforts to further zzso therapeutic effectiveness through drug delivery strategies that prolong tumor exposure to these S zzso agents, such as improving oral zzso through structure modification and innovative zzso approaches, alternative zzso dosage forms, and administration schedules, are being actively zzso Combining zzso with other zzso drugs and treatment zzso as well as gaining a better understanding of the factors contributing to tumor sensitivity and resistance, continues to be the object of considerable zzso
