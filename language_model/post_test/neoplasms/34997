Both in zzso and in zzso studies have demonstrated zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when tested with human tumor zzso A zzso zzso has been widely used to determine its direct zzso effects on human tumor cells in zzso using colony reduction as a zzso zzso As a single agent, zzso zzso shows maximum tumor cell colony reduction when used in high zzso with continuous cell zzso zzso exposure to zzso zzso does not produce significant tumor cell colony zzso zzso zzso have also been used to test combinations of zzso zzso with zzso zzso Variations in drug zzso sequencing and zzso have indicated the best combinations which maximize tumor cell colony zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to have at least additive and occasionally synergistic zzso zzso In clinical trials, optimal pairs of agents have been identified frequently combining either zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso has been adopted from in zzso studies and applied to most clinical zzso One study has enrolled 135 patients having a variety of advanced or zzso solid tumor types, using a zzso which combines zzso zzso and zzso administration, both given on a weekly basis for three weeks, followed by treatments every two weeks in responding zzso Clinical responses have been seen using this regimen in patients with zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso and in one zzso zzso Another study has been designed combining zzso prednisone and zzso zzso for the treatment of patients with zzso multiple zzso This is also based upon zzso zzso New methods of administration are being studied giving zzso zzso as a single agent or in combination with zzso by the zzso route to patients with zzso zzso zzso limited to the zzso zzso This method can maximize both the levels of zzso zzso as well as the tumor cell exposure zzso
