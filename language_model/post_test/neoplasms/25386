zzso are a family of zzso which may play a role in zzso tumor cell invasion of the zzso zzso zzso cells traverse two types of zzso zzso basement zzso and zzso zzso at multiple stages of the zzso zzso The zzso is a dense zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso does not contain open spaces large enough for cell zzso Therefore numerous investigators have zzso that zzso zzso zzso by tumor cells or associated host cells, breakdown the zzso zzso during tumor cell zzso A large number of animal and human tumors have been shown to contain zzso at a higher level than corresponding benign zzso Separate zzso zzso have been identified which degrade specific types of zzso A basement membrane zzso zzso was shown to be elevated in a series of zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso studies using zzso specific for zzso have demonstrated that in zzso tumor cells can produce zzso Therefore identification of zzso in cultured lines of tumor cells is not an artifact of in zzso zzso In some cases, tumor cells may induce host cells to produce zzso The best evidence to date that zzso actually play a role in invasion is derived from experiments in which natural zzso zzso block tumor cell invasion of zzso zzso in zzso
