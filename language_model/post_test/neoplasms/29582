Different zzso and pathological situations that produce zzso in the zzso zzso lead to a condition known as zzso zzso zzso stress activates a complex zzso signal zzso pathway, called unfolded protein response zzso zzso is tailored essentially to zzso zzso zzso However, when persistent, zzso stress can switch the zzso functions of zzso into cell death promoting zzso One of the cellular mechanisms that are regulated by zzso stress is zzso zzso is a cellular process by which different zzso components including zzso are targeted for degradation to the zzso Interestingly, like zzso stress, zzso can be a protective or a cell death promoting zzso Recently, a variety of zzso therapies (including those that stimulate zzso zzso have been shown to activate zzso in tumor cells, which has been proposed to either enhance cancer cell death or act as a mechanism of resistance to zzso In this chapter, we will describe some of the procedures that are currently used to analyze zzso as well as some of the experimental approaches that can be undertaken to investigate the connection between zzso stress and zzso in zzso
