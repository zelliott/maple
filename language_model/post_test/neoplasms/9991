Using a rat zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso protein of the Harvey strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso we have examined the zzso of human cells in tissue culture using zzso and electron zzso zzso results indicated that zzso mouse and human zzso cells have zzso amounts of zzso these levels were greatly increased after transformation with Harvey zzso A group of human tumor cell lines adapted to tissue culture were examined and almost all of the zzso tumor lines showed significant zzso with this zzso zzso exceptions were two melanoma cell lines which were negative for zzso by zzso When normal human zzso cells derived from zzso or zzso zzso were zzso the zzso showed significant zzso with zzso growing zzso After the normal cells were allowed to become zzso the zzso with this zzso zzso All of the zzso seen by zzso was in a distribution consistent with the previously demonstrated location of zzso zzso on the inner aspect of the plasma zzso zzso microscope zzso showed labeling for this zzso on the inner surface of the plasma membrane in both transformed mouse cells and in the human tumor cell lines zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the amounts of zzso proteins zzso in human zzso tumor cells do not necessarily reflect their zzso potential, but may be related to their zzso zzso The loss of zzso zzso at zzso suggests that zzso levels decrease when these zzso cells stop growing, and raises the possibility that an analog of zzso may be used by these human zzso cells to regulate cell zzso
