High affinity zzso receptors zzso have been identified in membrane zzso or tissue sections from several hundred human zzso zzso were found in most tumors originating from SS target zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumors, zzso zzso zzso tumors (including zzso and brain tumors, including zzso and zzso zzso were also expressed in several tumors originating from various other zzso zzso breast and small cell lung zzso some zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In general, most of the zzso tumors are zzso and/or have neuroendocrine zzso They often have low or absent zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso In some tumors zzso breast zzso zzso are not zzso distributed, making zzso zzso a particularly useful tool for assessing zzso zzso zzso are functional in zzso and zzso tumors where they mediate hormone zzso zzso In these and in the other zzso tumors, zzso may also mediate zzso effects of zzso as evidenced in animals where growth of zzso tumor zzso is inhibited by SS zzso For diagnosis, zzso tumors and zzso can be localized in zzso by scanning techniques after zzso SS analog zzso
