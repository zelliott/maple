zzso zzso zzso tumors are frequently more aggressive compared to corresponding tumors that are better zzso zzso to zzso is primarily zzso by two closely related zzso zzso zzso factor complexes, zzso and zzso which become stabilized and activated at low oxygen zzso Whether zzso and zzso have different roles in zzso is an open question and an issue we zzso With focus on zzso we zzso reported zzso changes of zzso genetic models and zzso expression patterns during normal development, in adult zzso zzso and in zzso We further address the much-discussed subject of target gene preferences between zzso and zzso given that both zzso factors bind to the same DNA zzso Finally, we also discuss the observations that the zzso zzso zzso is accumulated and active under zzso conditions as exemplified by zzso expressing tumor zzso and zzso cells located in seemingly zzso tumor regions and how this phenomenon is related to tumor zzso
