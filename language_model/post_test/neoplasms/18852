zzso zzso a zzso protein of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso in zzso result in the vascular zzso known as zzso zzso zzso zzso The soluble form of zzso was suggested to contribute to the zzso of zzso To obtain further insight into its function, we zzso zzso zzso and characterized the zzso domain zzso of mouse and human zzso fused to an zzso zzso zzso We found that mouse and human zzso zzso bound directly, specifically, and with high affinity to bone zzso proteins 9 and 10 zzso and zzso in surface zzso resonance zzso and zzso zzso We performed a function mapping analysis of the different zzso of zzso by examining their contributions to the selectivity and biological activity of the zzso The zzso binding site was localized to the orphan domain of human zzso composed of the zzso acid sequence zzso We established that zzso and type II receptors bind to overlapping sites on zzso In the in zzso chick zzso membrane zzso the mouse and the truncated human zzso zzso both significantly reduced zzso vessel zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso acted as an zzso factor that decreased blood vessel zzso in zzso zzso in in zzso zzso and reduced the tumor burden in the zzso mouse tumor zzso Together our findings indicate an important role of soluble zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso and highlight efficacy of zzso as a potential zzso therapeutic zzso
