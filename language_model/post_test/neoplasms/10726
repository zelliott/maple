zzso lipids or mobile lipids are defined as lipids that are zzso using zzso MRS in cells and zzso These zzso lipids are composed of zzso and cholesterol zzso that accumulate in neutral zzso zzso where their MR visibility is zzso as a result of the increased molecular motion available in this unique physical zzso This review discusses the factors that lead to the zzso of zzso lipids in cancer cells and in other cell types, such as immune cells and zzso We focus on the zzso of mobile lipids that are zzso in cultured cells by a number of zzso including culture conditions, and in response to zzso stimuli or zzso cell death induced by zzso zzso This is compared with animal tumor models, where increases in mobile lipids are observed in response to zzso and zzso and to human tumors, where mobile lipids are observed predominantly in high-grade brain tumors and in regions of zzso zzso conditions for mobile zzso formation in the tumor zzso are discussed, including low zzso oxygen availability and the presence of inflammatory zzso It is concluded that zzso lipids appear in cancer cells and human tumors as a stress zzso Mobile lipids stored as neutral zzso droplets may play a role in the zzso of the cell or act as an alternative energy source, especially in cancer cells, which often grow in zzso zzso The role of zzso lipids in cancer diagnosis and the assessment of the treatment response in both animal models of cancer and human brain tumors is also zzso Although technical limitations exist in the accurate detection of zzso mobile zzso early increases in mobile lipids after therapeutic interventions may be useful as a potential zzso for the assessment of treatment response in zzso
