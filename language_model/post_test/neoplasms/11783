zzso memory to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in several zzso strains of zzso zzso and indirect zzso zzso cell responses were measured in mice given a secondary challenge with zzso and in appropriate control zzso Strong zzso memory, but no zzso memory, was observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice gave both a strong zzso memory response and a relatively strong zzso memory response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were unable to mount significant zzso or zzso memory responses to this zzso under an identical zzso zzso These results are indicative of marked genetic variation in mice in the capacity for B memory cell zzso They also identify a provocative but unexplained association between positive zzso memory responses to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso mice and a propensity to develop zzso zzso This association is observed when there is no clear evidence for zzso zzso
