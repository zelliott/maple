zzso of potent zzso viruses zzso suitable for the clinic may require new strategies in virus zzso zzso viruses facilitate a variety of approaches to achieving tumor zzso zzso expression of zzso is a common hallmark of cancer that we demonstrate can be used to alter expression of a potent zzso viral gene to achieve zzso replication of an engineered zzso zzso virus zzso zzso of zzso zzso complementary sequences within zzso eliminates zzso replication and associated toxicity in normal cells but permits growth in cancer cells in zzso and in zzso This is proof of concept that viruses designed to exploit the differential zzso expression in cancer cells is a viable approach, potentially useful in zzso zzso viral gene expression for zzso zzso activity and zzso
