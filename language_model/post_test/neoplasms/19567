We have investigated methods of reconstructing beam profiles in the zzso region using a set of zzso zzso chambers, differing only in the detector zzso In principal, the transfer functions, or zzso of such chambers should be functions of radius zzso Three chambers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso The transfer functions of the chambers can be determined by zzso the profiles measured with each detector with the zzso zzso The results indicate that the transfer functions can be zzso accurately as a zzso zzso at zzso with zzso the average radius of the zzso zzso of the measured profiles with the transfer functions yields a profile that agrees with the zzso profile to zzso zzso zzso over the zzso zzso
