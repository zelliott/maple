Most zzso genes are able to express several zzso zzso in a phenomenon known as alternative zzso Serious zzso of alternative zzso occur in cancer zzso leading to expression of multiple zzso zzso zzso Most studies of alternative zzso defects have focused on the identification of zzso zzso zzso as potential therapeutic zzso Here, we examine instead the bulk of zzso transcript zzso and analyze their level of disorder using a measure of uncertainty called Shannon's zzso We compare zzso expression zzso in normal and cancer zzso from the same anatomical site for different classes of transcript zzso alternative zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas alternative initiation and zzso show no significant gain or loss of zzso between normal and cancer zzso alternative zzso shows highly significant zzso gains for 13 of the 27 zzso zzso This zzso gain is characterized by a zzso in the expression profile of normal zzso and is correlated to the level of estimated cellular proliferation in the cancer zzso Interestingly, the genes that present the highest zzso gain are enriched in zzso zzso We provide here the first quantitative estimate of zzso disruption in zzso The expression of normal zzso zzso is widely and significantly disrupted in at least half of the zzso zzso We zzso that such zzso disorders may develop in part from zzso zzso in key zzso factors, which in turn significantly impact multiple target zzso
