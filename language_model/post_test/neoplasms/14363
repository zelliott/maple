The group zzso 156 zzso zzso used for the study of zzso zzso and zzso zzso genetic markers of potential sensitivity to zzso zzso consisted of 37 healthy zzso zzso diabetes zzso without cancer, 64 cancer patients with zzso and 23 cancer patients without zzso No significant difference in carrying of zzso was found between zzso patients without and with zzso In cancer patients without zzso most characteristic data regarding potential zzso were detected with zzso of zzso gene while data on zzso and zzso zzso showed opposite zzso In regard of zzso the tendency to the more often finding of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso patients carrying zzso zzso of zzso deserves to be zzso In patients with zzso diabetes who carried zzso of potential response to zzso higher insulin resistance zzso and zzso as well as lower zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Thus, according to genetic zzso of sensitivity to zzso zzso patients with and without cancer differ in lesser degree than they differ from cancer patients without zzso It can not be zzso that The efficiency of such criteria might be increased due to combination with zzso and certain zzso zzso
