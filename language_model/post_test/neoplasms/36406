zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is detected in serum by determination of either the zzso activity of the zzso or the concentration of the zzso protein by zzso The most sensitive methods for determining zzso zzso activity are zzso zzso with a zzso of synthetic zzso zzso zzso or zzso containing a zzso or zzso fatty acid at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli grown in the presence of radioactive zzso acid may also be used as a zzso The released fatty acids are separated from the zzso zzso and zzso by liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso activities are increased in serum in zzso acute zzso zzso multiple injuries, zzso arthritis, and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso based on the use of either zzso or zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso have been developed for both pancreatic group I zzso zzso and zzso group II zzso zzso The cellular source of zzso in serum is the pancreatic zzso zzso Increased serum zzso values have been reported in acute zzso pancreatic cancer, and abdominal zzso Increased zzso values are found in conditions involving zzso zzso zzso infections, acute zzso various forms of arthritis, cancer, complications of pregnancy, and zzso zzso Good correlations have been found in serum samples between the zzso activity of zzso and the concentration of zzso but not zzso zzso may represent an zzso zzso The cellular source of the zzso in serum is zzso it is present in large amounts in cartilage and zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, seminal fluid, zzso zzso cells, and tears, but cannot be demonstrated by zzso or zzso methods in inflammatory zzso
