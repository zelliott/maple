Studies on zzso central zzso zzso zzso have been focused mainly on clinically evident zzso due to zzso zzso zzso therefore the actual zzso zzso This prospective study was aimed at evaluating zzso timing and evolution of zzso and identifying involved veins and risk factors in cancer patients zzso undergoing zzso zzso central zzso zzso zzso for chemotherapy, zzso nutrition or zzso We enrolled zzso consecutive zzso requiring partially or totally implanted central zzso zzso zzso The study protocol included peripheral zzso zzso at day 8, 30 and every two months following zzso and/or when clinically zzso along with peripheral and pullout P on zzso zzso A quantitative scale was developed to evaluate zzso grading in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Age, sex, zzso profile tumor zzso zzso therapy, zzso type, and zzso zzso side were also zzso Only zzso who underwent at least two P were zzso and zzso 2 test was adopted for statistical zzso Altogether, 95 zzso were zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso At day 8, 30 and 105 (representing the median days in which first, second and last P were zzso zzso was evidenced in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso grading did not differ among first, second and last zzso zzso was symptomatic in zzso zzso zzso zzso prevalence was higher in zzso zzso with respect to zzso zzso or zzso zzso veins zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in left zzso zzso zzso zzso than in right ones zzso zzso p zzso zzso No associations were established between zzso and other investigated zzso Our data show a very high actual frequency of zzso in cancer zzso and emphasize that first days following zzso are at the highest risk for zzso zzso Based on our results, a study on short-term zzso prophylaxis in cancer zzso requiring zzso is zzso Finally, our data indicate that left zzso vein zzso represents a risk factor for zzso
