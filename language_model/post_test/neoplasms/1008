The immune system has evolved sophisticated mechanisms composed of several checkpoints and zzso processes that enable it to orchestrate innate and zzso zzso while at the same time limiting zzso or unfaithful zzso zzso These multiple regulatory pathways take place during the entire zzso of T cells including zzso development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein widely expressed at sites of inflammation and tumor growth, controls a diversity of immune cell zzso acting either zzso through specific binding to cell surface zzso structures or zzso through zzso of pathways that remain largely zzso In this review, we highlight the discoveries that have led to our current understanding of the role of zzso in distinct immune cell process, particularly those associated with zzso zzso Also, we emphasize findings emerging from the study of experimental models of zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso and tumor growth, which have provided fundamental insights into the critical role of zzso and its specific zzso zzso in zzso Challenges for the future will embrace the rational manipulation of zzso interactions both towards attenuating immune responses in zzso diseases, graft zzso and zzso fetal loss, while at the same overcoming immune tolerance in chronic infections and zzso
