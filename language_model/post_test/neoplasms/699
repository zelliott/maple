The zzso protein zzso B zzso also known as zzso plays a pivotal role in diverse cellular zzso zzso expression of activated zzso has been detected in a wide variety of human zzso however, the mechanism of zzso protein stability regulation remains zzso In this study, we showed a strong correlation between the expression levels of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and levels of zzso zzso at zzso in multiple cancer types zzso zzso status combined with zzso expression levels predicted a poorer prognosis than did either one alone in patients with breast cancer zzso We further showed that zzso regulated zzso stability and zzso on zzso through the zzso zzso motifs of zzso These motifs are zzso evolutionary and are required for the maintenance of zzso stability and its interaction with zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression through either zzso zzso knockout or small interfering zzso zzso compromised its ability to protect zzso from zzso Our results show how zzso protein stability is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and highlight the importance of this zzso network in human disease zzso
