zzso of tumor cells zzso to zzso cells zzso is necessary for movement of zzso out of the zzso to form zzso zzso This interaction may be influenced by zzso molecules such as zzso products of zzso acid zzso We studied the effect of inflammatory zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso breast tumor cell line zzso zzso cell line zzso and non zzso zzso cell zzso were zzso as the number of zzso zzso attached to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were incubated with zzso zzso and zzso for varying time zzso zzso products zzso zzso were measured under zzso and zzso conditions using zzso and zzso There were no differences in zzso adherence of zzso lines to zzso When zzso were incubated with zzso there were significant increases in the numbers of zzso and zzso cells adherent to zzso compared to zzso Light and phase contrast zzso confirmed that zzso were attached to zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso produced zzso zzso while zzso and zzso produced zzso products zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso acid resulted in partial zzso of zzso to zzso Our data strongly indicate a role for zzso products of zzso acid in adherence of zzso to zzso
