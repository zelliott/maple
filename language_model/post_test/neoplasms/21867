Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells zzso into specific zzso cells holds great promise for cell replacement zzso However, it is unclear if in zzso zzso differentiation causes any zzso zzso such as zzso of zzso zzso Using a differential zzso zzso method, we identified 65 zzso islands (out of zzso zzso islands or zzso that exhibited increased DNA zzso during the conversion of zzso into neural zzso cells zzso These zzso zzso islands belong to genes in cell zzso signal zzso and cell zzso which are zzso different from zzso zzso island zzso observed in zzso genes during zzso We further determined that zzso in these zzso islands, which is probably triggered by de zzso DNA zzso zzso is zzso higher in zzso than in primary zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in promoter zzso islands of zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso apparatus gene zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso are significantly reduced in zzso when compared with zzso or primary neural zzso Because zzso is involved in zzso metabolism and zzso zzso in human is associated with the zzso zzso disorder, the reduced zzso expression in zzso raises a potential concern for the suitability of these cells in cell zzso zzso our data show that abnormal zzso island zzso takes place in a subset of genes during the zzso of zzso derivatives under current culture conditions, which may need to be monitored and corrected in future cell transplantation zzso
