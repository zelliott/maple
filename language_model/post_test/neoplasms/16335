We recently identified a novel gene that is zzso regulated by zzso calcium concentration with higher levels of transcripts in zzso animals zzso We named this gene zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work we report the zzso zzso of the zzso gene among different zzso We identified a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso We then zzso the strain distribution pattern of this zzso in 31 zzso originating from zzso and zzso rats, and compared it to the segregation of 475 markers localized in the rat genetic zzso zzso zzso to the rat zzso 7 between the markers zzso and zzso This region is zzso to human zzso zzso We identified three clones in zzso that contain the sequence of zzso It was therefore possible to narrow down the zzso of human zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, a suggestive zzso of mouse zzso based on conservation of linkage between human and mouse is on zzso zzso We previously identified a putative zzso motif zzso and a nuclear zzso domain zzso in the rat sequence of the zzso zzso zzso comparison between five different species showed that these zzso are highly zzso Furthermore, a search of zzso in zzso for zzso sequences showed that zzso is expressed only in zzso particularly in zzso
