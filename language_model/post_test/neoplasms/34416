A quantitative zzso method was developed for evaluating zzso from dogs with naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso migration ratios zzso were devised to zzso characteristic protein components and to analyze zzso in mobility of these protein zzso using a computerized zzso zzso zzso values from dogs with zzso zzso and zzso tumors were zzso using conventional methods of statistical zzso zzso indicate a statistical difference existed between mean values of zzso and zzso of zzso from dogs with tumors and those values from normal zzso In addition, unique zzso and concentration of protein components were identified for dogs with zzso zzso and zzso zzso
