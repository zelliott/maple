zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hybrid chains are biologically active like zzso zzso and structurally the most complex species of the zzso family along with zzso zzso They exist at the cell surface and zzso zzso in the form of zzso They function as regulators of functional proteins such as growth factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso through interactions with the zzso of these proteins via specific zzso zzso zzso zzso have been often implicated in pathological conditions, such as cancer and zzso Recent zzso of zzso zzso that bind growth factors, such as zzso and various zzso zzso against zzso have revealed a considerable number of unique zzso zzso This review focuses on recent advances in the study of the zzso relation of zzso zzso and their hybrid chains in zzso and pathological zzso
