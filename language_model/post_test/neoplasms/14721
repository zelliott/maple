This is a zzso analysis of a zzso collected zzso 

To determine zzso zzso and patient characteristics that contribute to an increased risk of zzso wound infection in patients undergoing spinal zzso 

Current literature sites a zzso infection rate of approximately zzso however, few have completed zzso analysis to determine factors which contribute to risk of zzso 

Our study identified patients who underwent a spinal zzso and fusion between 1997 and 2006 from the Veterans zzso National zzso Quality Improvement Program zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to determine the effect of various zzso variables on zzso zzso 

Data on zzso patients were zzso zzso infection was present in zzso zzso patients, zzso zzso deep, and zzso zzso zzso zzso infection was associated with longer hospital stay zzso zzso zzso zzso higher 30-day mortality zzso zzso zzso higher complication rates zzso zzso zzso and higher return to the operating room rates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified insulin dependent diabetes zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso current smoking zzso zzso zzso zzso class of 3 zzso zzso zzso or 4 to 5 zzso zzso zzso weight loss zzso zzso zzso dependent functional status zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso and an operative duration of 3 to 6 hours zzso zzso zzso or zzso hours zzso zzso zzso as statistically significant zzso of zzso zzso 

Using zzso analysis of a large zzso collected data from the National zzso Quality Improvement Program database, we identified the most important risk factors for increased zzso spinal wound zzso We have demonstrated the high zzso zzso and hospitalization costs associated with zzso spinal wound zzso The information provided should help alert clinicians to presence of these risks factors and the likelihood of higher zzso infections and morbidity in spinal surgery zzso
