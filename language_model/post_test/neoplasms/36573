Natural killer zzso cells are believed to contribute to the clinical efficacy of cancer zzso using zzso zzso zzso in zzso In previous trials of high-dose zzso zzso however, no correlation has been established between circulating zzso cells and treatment zzso Between January 1989 and October 1990, we treated a total of 47 zzso with advanced tumors using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consisted of a zzso zzso pulse at 18 million zzso followed by 6 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Before and after therapy, we zzso evaluated circulating zzso and correlated them with clinical zzso During zzso therapy, peripheral blood zzso bearing the zzso zzso surface zzso were increased significantly zzso zzso or zzso zzso in treatment zzso zzso response zzso and partial response zzso zzso zzso 10; zzso and stable disease zzso patients zzso zzso 20; zzso while patients with progressive disease zzso zzso zzso 17) exhibited no significant expansion of circulating zzso cells zzso zzso zzso After one zzso treatment cycle, zzso patients had significantly more peripheral zzso cells, when compared with patients in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall number of circulating zzso was also increased upon therapy zzso p zzso or zzso zzso but remained independent of response zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso produce a significant increase in peripheral blood zzso zzso this expansion zzso significantly with treatment response in advanced tumor patients receiving long-term combination zzso at zzso zzso
