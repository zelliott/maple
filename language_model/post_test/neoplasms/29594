zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso zzso leading to the synthesis of zzso A large amount of zzso and experimental evidence supports a role for zzso the zzso form of the zzso in human zzso notably in zzso zzso zzso mediates this role through the production of zzso that acts to inhibit zzso promote cell zzso stimulate zzso and decrease zzso Similarly, zzso is believed to be involved in the zzso of some zzso in domestic zzso Here, the author reviews the current knowledge on zzso expression and role in zzso of dogs, zzso and zzso Data indicate that zzso zzso is present in many animal zzso but there is presently not enough information to clearly define the zzso significance of zzso zzso To date, only few reports document an association between zzso expression and survival, notably in canine zzso zzso and zzso Some evidence suggests that zzso zzso could be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of certain zzso in domestic animals, the best example being urinary transitional cell zzso in zzso However, determination of the levels of zzso in a tumor does not appear to be a good zzso factor or a good indicator for the response to zzso zzso drug zzso Clearly, additional research, including the development of in zzso cell systems, is needed to determine if zzso expression can be used as a reliable zzso factor and as a zzso therapeutic target in animal zzso
