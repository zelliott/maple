The zzso of the zzso that occurs in most zzso cells and zzso cell cultures is considered a hallmark of cellular zzso zzso of zzso which is usually present in zzso cells, avoids zzso zzso and considerably extends the culture life zzso zzso human zzso cells are characterized by an accelerated rate of zzso zzso and reach zzso zzso after a limited number of cell zzso It has recently been reported that human zzso reverse zzso expression may be strongly zzso in human zzso cells zzso with tumor zzso Due to the important implications of this finding on tumor zzso we have extensively analyzed for the presence of zzso in primary human zzso cells either zzso with tumor cells or grown with zzso zzso We found modest, but readily zzso amounts of zzso in all human zzso cell cultures analyzed that disappeared as the cultures approached zzso zzso reverse zzso also showed a direct correlation between human zzso reverse zzso expression and the zzso index of the zzso Nevertheless, we did not find any evidence of induction of zzso activity by tumor cells in any of the tested zzso All data indicate that zzso in human zzso cells follows an zzso program that is strictly associated to the culture growth zzso
