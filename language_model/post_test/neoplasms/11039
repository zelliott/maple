DNA zzso patterns differ among children and adults and play an zzso role in several disease zzso particularly zzso The origin of these differences is zzso zzso and this is a question of specific relevance to childhood and adult zzso 

DNA zzso levels at zzso zzso zzso were zzso in 201 newborns zzso African American and 94 zzso zzso analyses were performed to examine the relation between these zzso levels and maternal parity, maternal age, newborn zzso age, newborn zzso and newborn zzso To identify the possible influences of zzso zzso was performed by a second and third zzso For genes containing zzso with significant differences in DNA zzso levels between races, analyses were performed to identify highly represented gene zzso terms and functional zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso zzso exhibited significantly different levels of DNA zzso between African Americans and zzso zzso of zzso zzso had significantly different DNA zzso levels between male and female zzso Cancer zzso including four zzso zzso zzso and zzso with substantial differences in zzso between the races, were highly represented among the genes containing significant zzso zzso 

At birth, there are significantly different DNA zzso levels between African Americans and Caucasians at a subset of zzso zzso It is possible that some of the zzso precursors to cancer exist at birth and that these differences partially explain the different zzso rates of specific zzso between the zzso
