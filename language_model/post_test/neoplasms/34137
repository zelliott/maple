Weekly administration of zzso has demonstrated comparable efficacy together with a distinct toxicity profile with reduced zzso although zzso data with weekly regimens are zzso The comparative zzso of zzso during weekly and once every 3 weeks zzso administration schedules were zzso 

zzso patients received weekly zzso (35 zzso as a zzso infusion alone zzso zzso 8) or in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso or in zzso regimens, as a zzso infusion at 60 zzso with zzso zzso zzso 10), 75 zzso alone zzso zzso zzso or 100 zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso blood samples were obtained immediately before and up to 21 days after the zzso Plasma zzso were measured by liquid zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso 

Mean zzso zzso zzso clearance values were similar with weekly and zzso schedules zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also similar with both schedules of administration zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso With extended plasma sampling beyond 24 h zzso zzso clearance was zzso lower and the terminal zzso was zzso zzso At 35 zzso the mean zzso zzso zzso concentration on day 8 was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 75 zzso zzso on day 8, 15, and 22 were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are similar for the weekly and zzso zzso zzso circulation of low zzso zzso of zzso may contribute to the mechanism of action of zzso through suppression of zzso dynamics and tumor zzso and enhanced cell zzso in combined zzso zzso
