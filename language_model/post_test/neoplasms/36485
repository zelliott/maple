We have studied the requirements that have to be met to combine effective cancer chemotherapy with the zzso of peripheral blood stem cells zzso We have shown that there is a differential induction of high numbers of zzso following zzso chemotherapy zzso plus treatment with zzso zzso The combined sequential administration of zzso 3 zzso plus zzso zzso factor zzso induced zzso numbers of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with the application of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso or chemotherapy zzso The number of zzso cells was highly variable depending on the prior treatment given to the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso used for zzso a varying cloning efficiency, and were zzso as to their level of zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells to pilot patients following high-dose chemotherapy demonstrated that zzso recruited by zzso chemotherapy plus zzso accelerated both zzso and zzso zzso
