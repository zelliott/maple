The zzso differences between benign and zzso zzso zzso as diagnosed by standard zzso criteria in 95 zzso cases zzso benign and 45 zzso were studied using the zzso zzso image analysis system, which zzso various parameters from zzso of cellular and nuclear zzso Fourteen cases were also stained for zzso proteins (with the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso technique and zzso for positive zzso zzso differences were found for mean values between zzso benign and zzso cases for cellular and nuclear areas, zzso and maximum zzso but not for two form zzso Some differences were enhanced in the zzso zzso zzso Real zzso differences in samples of cells from benign and zzso cases are the basis of zzso zzso zzso automated diagnostic systems could operate on arbitrary threshold values, but there is considerable overlap in zzso means for all parameters between benign and zzso zzso
