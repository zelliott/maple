Although euthanasia and zzso suicide zzso are controversial issues, the views of those most affected, terminal patients, are seldom zzso Our objective was to assess whether the attitudes about zzso of terminally ill cancer patients were determined by their symptomatic zzso 

We conducted a survey of 100 patients with terminal zzso Statements related to the zzso of zzso were scored using zzso zzso We also asked patients how often they had considered ending their zzso Their responses were analyzed in relation to disease zzso including an assessment of symptomatic severity, zzso features, general beliefs about the suffering of cancer patients, and zzso 

Most patients zzso supported euthanasia or zzso for one or more zzso The association between these attitudes and symptoms was weak, consistent in zzso analysis only for zzso of zzso No significant associations were observed with pain, zzso well-being, loss of zzso depression, or subsequent zzso zzso with euthanasia was significantly related to male sex, lack of religious beliefs, and general beliefs about the suffering of cancer patients and their zzso In zzso analysis, the only characteristics that remained statistically associated with support were the strength of religious beliefs and the perception that patients with cancer are a heavy burden on their zzso zzso of suicidal zzso was associated with poor well-being, depression, anxiety, and zzso of breath, but not with other zzso symptoms such as pain, zzso and loss of zzso 

zzso intensity had limited impact on the attitudes about euthanasia of terminally ill cancer zzso Our findings suggest that patient views are primarily determined by zzso traits and beliefs, as opposed to disease severity or symptomatic zzso
