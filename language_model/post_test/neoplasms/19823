During development, wound repair and zzso zzso such as cancer, normal, or zzso cell types traffic through the zzso zzso zzso the complex composite of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that dictate tissue zzso Current evidence suggests that zzso processes may proceed by zzso or zzso strategies whose selection is not only governed by the characteristics of the zzso cell population, but also by the structural properties of the intervening zzso zzso we review the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso zzso and pore size impact patterns of cell zzso This summary should prove useful when designing new experimental approaches for interrogating invasion programs as well as identifying potential cellular targets for next-generation zzso
