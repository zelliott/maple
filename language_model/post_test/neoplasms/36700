zzso growth zzso zzso has been shown to play a zzso role in zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso a zzso change and expression of zzso zzso activity in the human lung zzso cell line zzso cells within a week after the zzso These zzso induced zzso changes are thought to characterize the rapid onset of zzso When zzso cells were treated with zzso cell growth was not completely arrested, but the activity of zzso was down regulated via zzso repression of zzso reverse zzso which led to a zzso of the zzso during long-term culture and finally resulted in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is able to induce a rapid zzso in zzso cells without significantly zzso cell growth and can further direct zzso cells to a zzso zzso state via the suppression of zzso which culminates in zzso zzso All these experimental results suggest that zzso zzso several separate and independent signals to shift zzso cells back to a normal zzso zzso
