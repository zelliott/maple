We present a cellular zzso model of zzso evolution in cancer aimed at investigating the emergence of the zzso zzso In the model each cell is equipped with a zzso response network that determines the zzso or zzso of the cell based on the local zzso The response network is zzso using a zzso neural network, which is subject to zzso when the cells zzso This implies that cells might react differently to the environment and when space and nutrients are limited only the zzso cells will zzso With this model we have investigated the impact of the environment on the growth dynamics of the zzso In particular, we have zzso the influence of the tissue oxygen concentration and zzso zzso density on the dynamics of the zzso We found that the environment influences both the growth and the evolutionary dynamics of the zzso For low oxygen concentration we observe zzso with a fingered zzso while increasing the zzso density gives rise to more compact zzso with wider zzso The distribution of zzso in the zzso is also affected, and we observe that the zzso zzso is most likely to emerge in a poorly zzso tissue with a high zzso zzso Our results suggest that it is the combined effect of the oxygen concentration and zzso density that creates an environment where the zzso zzso has a growth advantage and consequently is most likely to zzso
