As our knowledge of the genetic and zzso abnormalities initiating and contributing to zzso grows, so too does the scope for earlier detection of cancer in zzso This bears an immense potential impact on the clinical management of patients with or at risk of solid tumors, since arguably the greatest problem facing clinicians is late zzso zzso tests have been developed to detect zzso or zzso zzso in zzso material and zzso enabling zzso and early detection zzso Although there are certain limitations, a number of studies have already demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of molecular screening in solid tumors, including zzso and lung zzso and such molecular approaches may soon be used routinely to detect precursor zzso and zzso zzso
