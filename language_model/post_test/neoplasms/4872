Information from patient surveys can help to identify patient groups and zzso with the greatest potential for improvement in the experience and zzso of cancer zzso We aimed to examine variation in the number of zzso consultations with a general practitioner between patients with different zzso and zzso zzso 

We zzso data from zzso patients with 24 different zzso who took part in the 2010 National Cancer Patient Experience zzso in zzso We examined variation in the number of general practitioner consultations with cancer symptoms before hospital referral to diagnose zzso zzso zzso was used to identify independent zzso of three or more zzso zzso adjusting for cancer type, age, sex, deprivation zzso and ethnic zzso 

We identified wide variation between cancer types in the proportion of patients who had visited their general practitioner three or more times before hospital referral zzso zzso of zzso for breast cancer and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso for pancreatic cancer and zzso zzso of zzso for multiple zzso In multivariable analysis, with patients with zzso cancer as the reference group, those with subsequent diagnosis of multiple myeloma zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer zzso zzso stomach cancer zzso zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso were more likely to have had three or more zzso zzso zzso patients with subsequent diagnosis of breast cancer zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso were more likely to have been referred to hospital after only one or two zzso The probability of three or more zzso consultations was greater in young patients zzso for patients aged zzso years vs zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso those from ethnic minorities zzso for Asian vs white zzso zzso zzso OR for black vs white zzso zzso zzso and women zzso for women vs men zzso zzso zzso We identified strong evidence of interactions between cancer type and age group and sex zzso for zzso and between age and ethnicity zzso The model including these interactions showed a particularly strong sex effect for zzso cancer zzso for women vs men zzso zzso zzso zzso and no apparent ethnic group differences in young patients aged zzso years, whilst the only zzso without an apparent age zzso were zzso cancer and zzso 

Our findings could help to zzso and zzso early diagnosis initiatives and research, focusing on patients with zzso and zzso characteristics with the largest potential for zzso
