We studied the effect of zzso zzso factor on the magnitude of peripheral blood stem cell zzso in patients with zzso The zzso products mobilized with zzso zzso factor alone at a steady state (a period of full zzso zzso zzso 1) were compared with those obtained after zzso chemotherapy using zzso zzso factor zzso zzso In group 1, six patients underwent six courses of stem cell collection with a median of 20 zzso zzso In group 2, 10 patients underwent 12 courses of stem cell collection with a median of 10 zzso zzso Median yields of group 1 zzso group 2 were zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unit for zzso zzso 223 zzso zzso zzso unit for zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso unit for zzso zzso 42 zzso 29; zzso unit for zzso zzso 26 zzso zzso While there were no statistically significant differences in the number of zzso cells between the two groups, zzso zzso cells were more enriched in the zzso products of group zzso The correlation between zzso cells and zzso unit for zzso was zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso factor can mobilize a sufficient number of zzso cells into the peripheral blood for stem cell transplantation with or without prior zzso
