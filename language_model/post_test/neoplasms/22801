In this contribution, we have prepared and explored a novel zzso based probe for the rapid identification and highly sensitive detection of cancer cells by means of an zzso zzso The new probe zzso zzso zzso salt zzso zzso salt for zzso which has specific spectral and zzso properties, has been zzso and assembled with carbon zzso to form a new type of zzso A simple method of zzso the zzso modified zzso based on zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been explored by using glassy carbon zzso zzso which could remarkably enhance the sensitivity of the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the combination of the new probe zzso with zzso modified zzso could be readily zzso to sensitively detect cancer cells such as liver cancer cells zzso and zzso drug sensitive leukemia zzso cells and drug resistant leukemia zzso cells, with a detection limit of zzso cells zzso This may provide a novel strategy for the potential and promising application of the new zzso molecular probe in the development of zzso responsive zzso for the early diagnosis of zzso
