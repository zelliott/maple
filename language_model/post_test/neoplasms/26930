To support doctors in diagnosing patients who are suspected to have pulmonary zzso the Christopher evidence-based decision rule was implemented in hospitals in the zzso This study examines whether the Christopher evidence-based decision rule is applied in clinical zzso In addition, doctors' considerations for not applying the decision rule are zzso 

zzso patients were included in the study zzso The diagnostic process of the patients with suspected pulmonary zzso as judged by the treating doctor, was compared with the Christopher evidence-based decision rule using patient record zzso In addition, 14 interviews were conducted with doctors who did not follow the Christopher evidence-based decision rule to obtain insights into their zzso 

In 80 of 247 zzso cases, the treating doctors suspected pulmonary zzso The Christopher evidence-based decision rule was applied in 17 out of 80 zzso In 22 cases, more tests were performed than was suggested by the decision rule zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso while in 41 cases fewer tests were performed than suggested by the decision zzso zzso for not following the decision rule included judging another diagnosis to be more likely and not wanting to expose the patient to zzso zzso 

The Christopher evidence-based decision rule for diagnosing pulmonary embolism was not always followed in everyday clinical zzso Doctors seem to base their diagnostic strategy on their own estimate of the likelihood of pulmonary zzso rather than the whole decision zzso Better adherence to the decision rule could be beneficial by making doctors aware that pulmonary embolism is more likely than they initially zzso However, in a substantial number of cases, it seemed justifiable that doctors deviated from the decision zzso zzso further research is needed to determine the value of the Christopher evidence-based decision rule in clinical zzso
