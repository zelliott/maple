zzso cell transformation and growth were studied in a plant zzso crown zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and total protein were estimated by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in stained tissue zzso Transformation of normal cells to tumor cells was accompanied by marked increases in zzso content of affected zzso reaching a maximum 2 to 3 days after zzso with virulent zzso Increased DNA levels were in part associated with increased zzso frequency, but also with progressive zzso of zzso in the higher DNA classes, formed by repeated DNA doubling without intervening reduction by zzso Some normal zzso of the higher DNA classes (with 2, 4, or 8 times the DNA content of zzso zzso were reduced to zzso levels by successive cell divisions without intervening DNA zzso The normal relation between DNA synthesis and zzso was thus disrupted in tumor zzso Nevertheless, clearly defined DNA classes, as found in zzso normal zzso were maintained in the tumor at all zzso
