Despite over 2 million papers published on cancer so far, zzso still remains a zzso complex disease with overall low survival zzso zzso our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of zzso and of resistance to therapy is crucial in guiding the successful design of zzso drugs and new zzso zzso The up-and-coming zzso zzso zzso technology and zzso analysis systems zzso are arguably the most promising platforms to address the inherent complexity of cellular systems with massive experimental zzso and zzso analysis on a single cell zzso This review discusses the emerging applications of zzso technologies and their advantages for cancer biology and experimental zzso We also zzso the recent advances in zzso systems to study cancer cell zzso cancer zzso and real-time zzso pharmacological zzso zzso systems, such as cell zzso together with zzso zzso zzso and zzso technologies, are all highlighted with the view of describing their potential applications in pharmacological zzso drug discovery, and clinical zzso It is zzso that zzso solutions may well represent the platform of choice for next generation in zzso cancer zzso
