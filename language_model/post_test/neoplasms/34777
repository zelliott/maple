Period analysis estimates up-to-date survival rates of cancer zzso In this approach, analysis is restricted to recent time period by zzso all observations at the beginning of the period and zzso at its zzso Here, we applied period analysis to examine changes in zzso relative survival zzso by age group for 1997 and for zzso 

Using the National Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso was estimated for 1997 and 2002 in four age groups zzso zzso zzso and 75 years old and zzso using period zzso After excluding death zzso cases, patients with an unknown date of diagnosis or follow-up zzso a total of zzso patients diagnosed with a first primary invasive cancer during zzso were included for zzso zzso for vital status was included until 31 December zzso 

zzso zzso increased from zzso for 1997 to zzso for zzso zzso in survival occurred in all age groups except in the 75 and over zzso 

The age zzso in cancer prognosis seems to have widened between 1997 and 2002, a finding that requires further study of zzso factors, including stage at zzso Period analysis accurately estimates survival rates, especially for zzso with better zzso
