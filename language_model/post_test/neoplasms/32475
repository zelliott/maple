There is accumulating evidence from zzso studies that circulating zzso cells zzso play an important role in zzso and tumor zzso The role of zzso in human cancer progression is sparsely zzso We therefore analyzed zzso in peripheral blood of cancer zzso In addition, we correlated zzso levels in these patients with plasma levels of zzso that are known to mobilize zzso in experimental zzso 

zzso zzso were isolated, zzso and cultured from cancer patients' whole blood by using magnetic beads coupled to an zzso directed against zzso a zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso Positive zzso for specific zzso cell markers zzso von zzso factor, zzso vascular zzso cell growth factor zzso zzso was used to confirm the zzso zzso 

Cancer patients with progressive disease (95 zzso had on average zzso more zzso than healthy subjects zzso patients, P zzso Patients zzso with stable disease had zzso numbers equal to that circulating in healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso A subset of in zzso cultured zzso incorporated into zzso layers and formed zzso Plasma levels of zzso that are thought to mobilize zzso from the bone zzso zzso zzso growth factor, zzso cell derived factor zzso and stem cell factor (71 zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso The levels of viable zzso in cancer patients were modified by zzso zzso factor treatment and zzso 

In progressive cancer patients, the amount of zzso is zzso These zzso are viable and may contribute to vessel zzso The number of zzso is influenced by zzso zzso
