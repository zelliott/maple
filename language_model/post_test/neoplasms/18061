From a review of decades of intensive zzso research and prospective validation studies, it becomes clear that only a limited number of zzso can be used to provide reliable documentation of excessive exposure to environmental zzso agents, expression of zzso biological effects from the exposure and increased risk for zzso These studies also demonstrate that expression of each zzso represents an integrated response to the exposure that is influenced by zzso factors, and an integral component of the complex zzso zzso A current interest is in the use of zzso functional zzso to improve and complement the assessment of cancer zzso A recommended approach includes zzso that indicate DNA repair zzso zzso zzso reporter gene and challenge zzso zzso The usefulness and limitations in zzso investigations will be zzso The review emphasizes the need for carefully designed investigations that involve adequate sample sizes and a combination of appropriate zzso to generate zzso results that can be translated into more reliable cancer risk zzso The assessment can be used to drive the zzso of disease prevention and intervention zzso Such an approach is consistent with the current priority in translating basic science knowledge into health zzso
