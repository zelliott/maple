Environmental pollution with zzso zzso in addition to individual abuse, are discussed as important factors causing development of zzso We must assume that certain zzso and zzso compounds, which are ubiquitous in our ecosystem, must have zzso effects on humans zzso The aim of this study is therefore to examine the extent to which the zzso of the potentially zzso metal zzso zzso and zzso could be measured in tissue from zzso zzso We examined zzso and zzso tissue obtained from a total of 48 patients who had zzso of the stomach, zzso or zzso We also analyzed zzso and zzso content in whole blood and urine samples from these zzso The quantitative metal zzso were done using atomic zzso zzso zzso between zzso and/or zzso content in zzso or zzso tissue were not zzso An zzso of these metal zzso in zzso tissue is therefore zzso We were also unable to find differences in metal content with regard to zzso and zzso as related to the appearance of zzso in the zzso In contrast, zzso patients had a zzso to zzso increase over normal values for zzso and zzso in blood and zzso This was attributable to unavoidable contamination of tissue and body zzso with zzso and zzso instruments during major surgical zzso
