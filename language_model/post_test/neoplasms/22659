zzso of functional zzso is responsible for zzso cell transformation and the maintenance of zzso state of human zzso cancer zzso Thus, restoration of zzso has been regarded as an important strategy for molecular intervention combating zzso zzso We show here that depleting zzso B1 zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cervical cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso cells depleted of zzso B1 exhibit zzso defects in zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso B1 increases zzso alternative reading frame of zzso the positive regulator of zzso and decreases zzso of zzso in zzso Whereas zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso 1 zzso suppresses this zzso at zzso of zzso zzso targeting Aurora zzso zzso shows no zzso Further analyses in zzso cells and zzso zzso cells suggest that the zzso zzso by zzso regulates zzso the protein stability and the function of zzso Moreover, increased zzso in zzso cells is functional by showing its increased downstream zzso zzso mouse double minute 2 and zzso Restoration of zzso and zzso zzso B1 render cervical zzso cells more susceptible to DNA damage agent zzso Taken together, targeting zzso B1 might be an attractive strategy for preventing and treating zzso cancer by zzso zzso and by reducing the zzso zzso
