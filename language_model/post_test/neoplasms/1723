The standardized mortality ratio zzso is frequently used to compare health status among different zzso However, it may be biased when based upon communities with small population sizes such as towns, cities, and zzso Thus, comparison of zzso among such small communities is not zzso But the zzso zzso estimate of standardized mortality zzso zzso is, in contrast, a useful zzso The objective of the present study was to use the zzso to clarify the relationships between health care resources and zzso in 109 communities in zzso zzso 

Data for health care resources zzso of physicians, number of general clinics, number of general zzso in hospitals, number of emergency hospitals, and proportion of elderly zzso within their zzso zzso and socioeconomic factors zzso rate, inflow or zzso population, aged households, marital status, zzso income per individual under taxes duty, unemployment, primary, secondary, zzso industrial employment and criminal offense zzso were obtained from officially published zzso zzso for all causes, cerebrovascular disease, heart disease, zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso were calculated from the zzso vital statistic zzso Multiple zzso analysis with zzso variable selection was used to examine the relationships between zzso and the five variables representing health care resources, considering the zzso socioeconomic factors as zzso Some of the variables were zzso to zzso the zzso 

Some of the zzso were zzso related to the numbers of physicians per person zzso zzso zzso in males zzso and females zzso emergency hospitals per person zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and general zzso per person (all causes in zzso zzso cerebrovascular disease in zzso zzso heart disease in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, when the higher the number of clinics per person, the higher the zzso in females for all causes zzso as well as acute zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that an appropriate distribution of hospital care resources such as physicians, general zzso and emergency hospitals is an important factor related to mortality in a zzso
