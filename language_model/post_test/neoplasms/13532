We attempted to identify zzso genes whose expression is affected by DNA zzso and that participate in the determination of the biological characteristics of human zzso 

We used the differential display method in ten zzso human cancer cell zzso zzso induction of zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso unit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso was observed during zzso zzso We then evaluated the zzso expression of these genes in 26 stomach and 32 zzso zzso and 44 zzso zzso zzso and in the corresponding zzso zzso 

zzso reduced zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso in stomach zzso of zzso zzso zzso region zzso unit zzso zzso and ROCK in zzso zzso and of zzso zzso and zzso region zzso unit zzso in zzso was observed in comparison with the corresponding zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso region zzso unit zzso was significantly correlated with poorer differentiation of zzso and zzso expression of these genes was significantly reduced in zzso associated with portal vein involvement compared with zzso without such zzso zzso of zzso zzso was significantly higher in chronically diseased liver from zzso patients compared with zzso normal liver, but was reduced in progressed zzso zzso expression of zzso protein was observed in association with zzso B virus infection of zzso zzso 

These data suggest that DNA zzso may play a role in human zzso zzso through direct or indirect regulation of multiple zzso zzso
