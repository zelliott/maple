zzso is expressed in many tumors, including melanoma, zzso tumors, lung tumors and zzso but not in healthy zzso with the exception of zzso Thus, zzso peptides that bind to zzso class I molecules and elicit zzso T zzso zzso responses could be of significant therapeutic zzso In this study, we show that several zzso peptides bind with high affinity to zzso Three of them form complexes with zzso that are stable at 37 degrees C and are zzso in zzso transgenic zzso Moreover, zzso against 2 of them zzso zzso and zzso zzso specifically recognize cells that express both the zzso protein and zzso These 2 peptides are processed and presented in the context of zzso zzso these peptides are candidate components in zzso vaccines for the treatment and prevention of several types of zzso zzso
