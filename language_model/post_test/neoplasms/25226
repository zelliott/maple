The number of zzso protein targets has significantly increased over the past decade due to advances in molecular and cellular biology technologies, human genetic mapping efforts and information gathered from the human zzso zzso The identification of gene products that appear to be involved in supporting the underlying cause of disease has offered the zzso industry an opportunity to develop compounds that can specifically target these molecules to improve therapeutic responses and lower the risk of unwanted side effects that are commonly seen in traditional small zzso zzso 

An overview of targeted drug therapies is presented in this zzso We include a review of the various classes of targeted therapeutic agents, the types of zzso molecules being targeted by these agents and the challenges currently being encountered for the successful development of these various platforms for the treatment of zzso 

An understanding of the current targeted therapy landscape, the discovery and selection of zzso gene products that are being targeted, and an overview of targeted therapies in zzso and clinical zzso A description of the various targeted therapeutic platforms, target selection criteria and examples of each are discussed in order to provide the reader with the current status of the field and emerging areas of targeted therapy discovery and zzso 

Novel medications are in demand for the treatment of serious medical conditions including cancer, zzso infectious and zzso zzso zzso therapies offer a way to develop very specific treatments for serious medical conditions while zzso resulting in little to no zzso zzso zzso therapies provide an opportunity to develop personalized medicines with superior treatment zzso for the patient and a better quality of zzso
