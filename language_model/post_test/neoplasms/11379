zzso is an zzso that is structurally similar to zzso Because zzso zzso drugs zzso impair zzso clearance and increase its zzso we evaluated the zzso and toxicity of zzso when zzso with aspirin or zzso in advanced cancer zzso 

In two independent, randomized, crossover drug interaction studies, cancer patients with a zzso clearance zzso zzso or zzso zzso received an zzso zzso or zzso with either the first or the second dose of zzso zzso 1 or zzso zzso zzso zzso was infused zzso on day 1 of a zzso cycle, and all patients were supplemented with oral zzso acid and zzso vitamin zzso Aspirin zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso 200 zzso was given orally every 6 hours, starting 2 days before zzso administration, with the ninth and final dose taken 1 hour before zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso treatment were compared for cycles 1 and zzso 

Data from 27 patients in each study were zzso for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso of aspirin did not alter zzso zzso however, zzso zzso was associated with a zzso reduction in zzso a zzso increase in maximum plasma zzso and a zzso increase in area under the plasma concentration versus time curve but no significant change in zzso compared with zzso zzso No zzso zzso occurred in any patient, and no increase in zzso toxicity was associated with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with vitamin supplementation is well tolerated and requires no dosage adjustment when zzso with aspirin (in patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso (in patients with zzso zzso or zzso zzso
