We previously reported a flow zzso technique to monitor zzso effects of the zzso zzso inhibitor BAY zzso based on the ability of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso et zzso zzso zzso In this article, we describe its application to phase I trials of BAY zzso in solid tumor and zzso zzso 

The previously described whole blood zzso method was used to monitor BAY zzso effects on peripheral zzso of solid tumor zzso A modified whole blood fixation protocol was developed for the zzso trial, using the zzso zzso stem cell factor zzso to activate zzso as an alternative to zzso and incorporating zzso markers to identify zzso zzso 

At all dose levels of BAY zzso used to treat solid tumor patients, zzso could be activated by zzso in peripheral zzso and we were not able to show zzso of zzso zzso A similar effect was seen in the zzso of zzso patients during treatment with BAY zzso However, we found strong zzso when zzso was activated via zzso using zzso Furthermore, normal donor zzso stem cells were much more sensitive to BAY zzso when zzso was activated by zzso compared to zzso 

These findings support the further development of flow zzso applications to monitor signal zzso zzso during early phase clinical zzso
