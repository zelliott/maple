zzso investigations show a decreased zzso of zzso acid in vitamin B12 deficient human cell cultures and bone zzso zzso zzso acid cannot be liberated from its storage zzso This so-called zzso results in a functional zzso acid zzso which is the zzso principle of the zzso in the cell proliferation in patients with vitamin B12 zzso This knowledge of zzso mechanisms leads to the identification of rare disorders in the metabolism of vitamin B12 and zzso zzso After zzso treatment a rescue effect with its antidote zzso can only be zzso if the ratio zzso zzso is at least zzso This ratio is important in cell cultures as well as in bone zzso cells in zzso The results lead to a formula for the calculation of the optimal zzso to reach a secure rescue for individual patients after high-dose zzso zzso This makes the high-dose zzso regimen a treatment zzso for zzso tumors without any side zzso
