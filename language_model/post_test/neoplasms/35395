In cancer cells, zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso into the zzso zzso This zzso designated as zzso protein zzso A zzso is markedly zzso in the zzso of patients with zzso The currently available tumor markers are based on the zzso determination method and lack specificity and zzso Here, we present an zzso zzso detection method for a universal zzso that detects cancer of various cell zzso We tested zzso from 295 patients with zzso of various cell types, 155 normal controls, and 55 patients without zzso The specificity and sensitivity of this zzso zzso zzso method were compared with the conventional zzso determination method by zzso characteristic zzso In the zzso the presence of zzso directed against zzso was highly correlated with zzso High zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso were found in the zzso of patients with various zzso whereas low or negative zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso were found in the control zzso The zzso characteristic plot showed that zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso exhibited zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso These results show that the zzso method distinguished between patients with cancer and controls better than the zzso method zzso Our results show that zzso zzso is a universal serum zzso for zzso of various cell zzso
