The significance of zzso stalk zzso zzso on magnetic resonance imaging zzso is often zzso We evaluated presenting symptoms, zzso findings, clinical course, and outcome zzso of patients with zzso 

We used a computerized search of the medical record from 1995 to 2008 to identify patients with zzso without zzso mass on zzso zzso and follow-up zzso were reviewed in a blinded zzso zzso clinical data were zzso 

69 patients with reported zzso and adequate imaging for review were zzso 42 met study zzso Median age at first abnormal zzso was zzso years zzso zzso zzso were zzso Median follow-up was zzso years zzso zzso Patients with diabetes zzso zzso were significantly more likely to have a zzso process than those without zzso Of 16 patients with zzso 8 zzso had a zzso process, including germ cell tumor zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among patients with zzso 7 zzso also developed anterior zzso hormone dysfunction zzso either at presentation or on zzso zzso including zzso patients with stalk zzso and only zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso Twenty-six patients presented without zzso none was found to have zzso of the stalk except one patient with zzso zzso of zzso on follow-up imaging was significantly associated with a subsequent zzso diagnosis zzso 

Patients with zzso without zzso are unlikely to have a zzso zzso Among patients with zzso zzso or progressive stalk increase over time are zzso of zzso
