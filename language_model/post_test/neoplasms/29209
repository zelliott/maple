Some diseases are due to zzso zzso in zzso zzso such as cancer family zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cumulative risk zzso for zzso carriers is essential for defining prevention zzso The zzso likelihood zzso method is aimed at zzso zzso from multiple case families with such a zzso In this paper, we proposed an extension of the zzso to account for multiple trait disease and to allow for a zzso zzso Using simulations of zzso we studied the properties of this method and the effect of departures from underlying zzso zzso of disease zzso in the general population or zzso of the index case, and zzso zzso In contrast with the previous version of the zzso accounting for multiple trait disease allowed unbiased zzso of zzso We also showed that accounting for a zzso effect allowed a powerful test for detecting this zzso We found that the zzso method was robust to zzso of disease zzso in the population, but that zzso of the index case induced a bias in some situations for which we proposed efficient zzso When ignoring zzso the zzso estimate was biased toward that of the highest risk zzso A zzso test performed by zzso the families according to the number of affected members was shown to have low power and seems useless for detecting such zzso These extensions are essential to better estimate the risk of diseases and to provide valid recommendations for the management of zzso
