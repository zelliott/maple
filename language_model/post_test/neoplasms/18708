zzso such as zzso mediate cellular and zzso transformation during zzso To analyze zzso zzso zzso we employed zzso zzso flux analysis zzso zzso zzso fate detection zzso of zzso zzso and zzso profiling in mouse zzso and human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso determination of zzso zzso indicated that cells expressing zzso zzso exhibited enhanced zzso activity, decreased zzso flux through the zzso acid zzso cycle, and increased zzso of zzso for anabolic zzso Surprisingly, a zzso labeling of zzso zzso zzso was detected in both transformed cell zzso zzso profiling detected elevated expression of several genes associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso upon transformation with zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso along these pathways further supports the decoupling of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso increased carbon to drive the zzso zzso These results provide evidence for a role of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of cancer zzso
