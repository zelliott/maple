It is clear that the rate of change in biology is rapidly zzso This is most apparent in the zzso area with respect to the development of new cancer zzso New surgical approaches are being developed, and new forms of delivery for therapeutic radiation are now zzso zzso are now also being zzso Similarly, new zzso agents and new methods of utilizing existing drugs are being zzso However, the use of zzso either alone or in combination with these other zzso is the area of greatest change and can be expected to be a major factor in achieving a greater understanding of cancer biology and a greater therapeutic specificity in the treatment of cancer patients in this decade zzso zzso Given the new technology of the zzso this is an exciting zzso It is hoped that sufficient resources will be available to support continuing efforts to develop zzso into effective zzso zzso The rapidly advancing technologies of computers, cell fusion, and genetic engineering are all interrelated through the zzso of molecular biology to offer us unparalleled opportunities in biological zzso These opportunities should translate into more effective treatments for cancer in this zzso
