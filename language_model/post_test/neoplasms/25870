zzso studies of zzso zzso beam performance in zzso zzso capture therapy are presented for realistic zzso beams with varying zzso and zzso designs to examine the relative importance of zzso beam spectrum, zzso and zzso Figures of merit for zzso and zzso beam performance are calculated via the zzso Carlo technique for different zzso designs of a zzso zzso zzso zzso beam with head zzso as the zzso zzso It is shown that increasing zzso a measure of beam zzso does not always lead to corresponding zzso improvements in beam zzso Due to the relatively low significance, for most zzso of its effect on zzso performance and the large intensity losses required to produce beams with very high zzso beam zzso should not be considered an important figure of merit in zzso zzso beam design except in terms of its consequences on patient positioning and collateral zzso zzso the zzso beam spectrum, while maintaining the specific fast zzso dose well below the inherent hydrogen capture dose, improves beam penetration and advantage depth and, as a desirable zzso significantly increases beam zzso zzso figures of merit are shown to be strongly dependent on beam size relative to target zzso zzso designs with zzso approximately zzso specific fast zzso doses of zzso zzso zzso and beam sizes equal to or larger than the size of the head target produced the deepest useful zzso highest therapeutic ratios, and highest zzso
