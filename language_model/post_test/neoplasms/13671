The zzso zzso product zzso acts as a zzso and binds to other zzso zzso and zzso which form a complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso repression by a number of zzso including nuclear hormone receptors and zzso zzso also directly binds to, and recruits the zzso complex to zzso leading to zzso of tumor growth zzso zzso zzso This is consistent with the function of ski as an zzso Here we show that loss of one copy of zzso increases zzso to zzso in zzso When challenged with a chemical zzso zzso zzso mice showed an increased level of tumor formation relative to zzso zzso In addition, zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso had increased zzso capacity, whereas zzso of zzso suppressed the zzso Furthermore, the introduction of activated zzso into zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso acts as a tumor zzso in some types of zzso The level of zzso zzso which is down regulated by two tumor zzso gene products, zzso and zzso was zzso in zzso zzso whereas it decreased by zzso zzso in zzso This is consistent with the fact that zzso acts as a zzso of Mad and zzso These results support the view that the decreased activities of Mad and zzso in zzso cells at least partly contribute to enhanced proliferation and zzso to zzso Human zzso gene was mapped to a region close to the zzso tumor zzso gene at the zzso zzso which is already known to contain multiple zzso tumor zzso zzso
