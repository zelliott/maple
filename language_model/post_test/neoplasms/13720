In the last decade zzso zzso zzso have emerged as promising technology in gene zzso They have been used for genetic modification of a variety of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso They have been widely used as gene delivery zzso in experiments both with zzso and preventive zzso zzso zzso have been used in the experimental and in some extent in the clinical gene therapy of a variety of zzso The combination of zzso zzso technology with chemotherapy zzso drug zzso seems to be promising, zzso zzso zzso offer several advantages over other zzso zzso defective zzso can be produced in very high zzso zzso zzso thus allowing a substantially greater efficiency of direct gene zzso they have the capacity to zzso both replicating and zzso zzso cells from a variety of zzso and zzso Several important limitations of zzso zzso gene transfer are also known, such as the relatively short-term zzso expression of foreign zzso induction of the host zzso and cellular immune response to viral proteins and viral infected cells, which may substantially inhibit the effect of repeated treatment with zzso zzso the limited cloning capacity and the lack of target cell zzso However, the zzso structure, molecular biology and host cell interactions of zzso offer some potential solutions to these zzso
