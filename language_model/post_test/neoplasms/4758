zzso zzso stem cells zzso have recently boomed enthusiasm in stem cell therapy, whereas high potential zzso of zzso has become the biggest obstacle for clinic application and the zzso genes in zzso have not been well zzso In this investigation, using tools of zzso we analyzed the all available zzso regarded to zzso from 11 differentiated cell lines and revealed zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 209 were expressed in human tumor cell lines and cancer zzso and some of them were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso were zzso in the zzso and an zzso zzso in the zzso cells, suggesting that these zzso consensus genes are implicated with the risk of zzso and zzso This investigation provides useful information for designing new strategies and methods to curtail the expression of zzso genes in zzso and produce safe zzso derivatives for stem cell zzso
