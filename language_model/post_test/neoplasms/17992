zzso are important in the life and death of immune cells and therefore influence immune surveillance of zzso We tested whether genetic zzso in zzso zzso and zzso three genes important for death zzso cell killing residing in tandem order on zzso zzso are associated with cancer zzso Using a zzso zzso approach, we identified a zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter associated with decreased risk of lung zzso The deletion destroys a zzso protein 1 binding site and decreases zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that T zzso with the deletion zzso had lower zzso activity and zzso cell death upon stimulation with cancer cell zzso zzso analyses of zzso individuals with cancer and zzso controls in a Chinese population showed that this genetic zzso is associated with reduced zzso to multiple zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso cervical and breast zzso acting in an zzso zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that genetic zzso influencing immune status modify cancer zzso
