In this review I have attempted to a describe some of the recent mouse zzso models and their impact on our understanding of cancer zzso The focus has been on cell cycle regulatory genes and DNA repair genes which are likely to affect cancer development at least in part through genetic instability zzso The cell cycle regulatory genes classified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso maintain zzso stability and inhibit cancer through their roles in preserving cell cycle zzso The cell cycle zzso have variable effects on cancer zzso and their role in preserving genetic stability remains largely zzso The DNA repair gene models described here show the most direct connection between genetic instability and cancer, even in the absence of zzso cell cycle zzso It should be clear that the development of mice deficient in cell cycle control or DNA repair will provide useful tools for studying the interplay of these processes with genetic instability and zzso Important new insights into the mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression are likely to come increasingly from such models in the coming zzso
