This zzso of the current zzso zzso cancer potency factor for zzso is based upon a review of zzso zzso zzso in mice conducted by zzso zzso zzso report, zzso and the National Cancer Institute zzso zzso Report Series zzso 37, conducted by Gulf South Research Institute, zzso The zzso data available for zzso including consideration of the potential of the compound to induce zzso was examined with an emphasis on whether this information supports a change in the cancer potency zzso If a quantitative zzso assessment for zzso is to be performed, the data from both the zzso and zzso cancer zzso should be zzso Additionally, liver tumor results from female mice, rather than male mice, should be used for zzso potential human cancer risk because the background rate of liver tumors in females is lower and less variable than that exhibited by zzso An zzso was estimated as the point of zzso The zzso data were not sufficient to fully support a margin of exposure zzso zzso we believe that applying a linear zzso from the zzso to the origin is an appropriate means to estimate risk at low zzso This is a highly conservative approach and, when it is applied, we conclude that the current zzso cancer potency factor should be reduced from zzso zzso to zzso zzso
