To examine the recent zzso and trends of childhood zzso solid tumors in zzso 

Data from the zzso Shanghai Cancer zzso and related retrospective survey were used to analyze the patterns of zzso and trends of zzso solid tumors diagnosed between 2002 and 2010 in children aged zzso zzso The zzso of zzso were described according to zzso age and cancer types which were classified according to International zzso of Childhood Cancer zzso Annual zzso rates zzso were adjusted by the world standard zzso Approximate confidence intervals for standardized rate ratios zzso based zzso distribution zzso methods were used to assess changes in zzso over the period 2002 - 2006 and 2007 - zzso 

zzso total of zzso cases of childhood zzso solid tumors were diagnosed in Shanghai during 2002 - 2010, accounting for zzso of all childhood zzso The zzso of 2002 - 2010 was zzso per million for all solid zzso zzso The zzso was higher in boys zzso per million) than in girls zzso per million) with zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso rate was the highest in the first five years of life with zzso per zzso The zzso zzso rates in 5 - 9 and 10 - 14 age groups were zzso and zzso per million, zzso zzso zzso tumors, zzso germ cell tumors, zzso and soft tissue zzso were the top 5 most common solid tumors in children, with the zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso per million, zzso The patterns of zzso varied in different age zzso zzso such as zzso zzso were more common in the children aged 0 - 4 years, whereas zzso zzso and bone tumors developed more frequently in elder children aged 10 - 14 zzso zzso Compared with the zzso in 2002 - 2006, the zzso for both genders in 2007 - 2010 had no substantial changes zzso per million in 2002 - 2006 and zzso per million in 2007 - zzso However, among boys, the zzso rate in 2007 - 2010 was significantly higher than that in 2002 - 2006 with zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso For specific zzso of cancer, there were no substantial zzso Some cautions should be taken when interpreting results involving a small number of cases per year and those with wide zzso confidence zzso
