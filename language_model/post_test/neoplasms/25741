Progressive wasting is common in many types of cancer and is one of the most important factors leading to early death in cancer zzso Weight loss is a potent stimulus to food intake in normal humans and zzso The persistence of anorexia in cancer patients, therefore, implies a failure of this zzso feeding response, although the weight loss in the patients differs from that found in simple zzso zzso progress has been made in the last 5 years with regard to the regulation of feeding and body zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso a hormone zzso by zzso zzso is an integral component of the zzso loop of body weight zzso zzso acts to control food intake and energy expenditure via zzso zzso molecules within the zzso Complex interactions among the nervous, zzso and immune systems affect the loop and induce behavioral and zzso zzso A number of zzso including tumor necrosis zzso zzso 1 and 6, zzso leukemia zzso factor, and zzso zzso factor have been proposed as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso may play a pivotal role in long-term zzso of feeding by mimicking the zzso effect of excessive negative feedback signaling from zzso This could be done by persistent stimulation of zzso zzso such as zzso factor, as well as by zzso of the zzso Y zzso network that consists of zzso peptides and zzso in addition to the newly identified zzso hormone, zzso and zzso zzso Information is being gathered, although it is still insufficient, on such abnormalities in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso animals that coincide with the development of anorexia and zzso zzso of the zzso gene products have revealed new zzso pathways and molecular targets for pharmacological intervention that will likely lead to new zzso Although therapeutic intervention using zzso zzso is now directed at obesity treatment, it may also have an effect on treating cancer zzso especially when combined with other agents that have effects on muscle and protein zzso
