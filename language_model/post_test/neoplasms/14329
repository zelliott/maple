The article discusses results of the structural and functional analysis of molecular genetic abnormalities in various zzso zzso zzso have discovered more than 20 new markers for sporadic breast zzso Several of them formed the test system, allowing the diagnosis with a specificity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene is a frequent zzso event, its expression is correlated with more aggressive forms of prostate cancer, may serve as a molecular marker for tumor cells and zzso assessment of tumor response to hormonal zzso The effective systems for the early diagnosis of zzso and zzso cancer were developed as zzso zzso in the zzso deletions of zzso 3 and zzso of several genes can predict the course and selection of effective therapy of clear cell kidney cancer, a number of molecular markers were identified for early diagnosis and prognosis of recurrence of zzso zzso For diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain tumors we developed an effective complex system of zzso zzso of molecular zzso investigation reveals the cause of the disease by more than zzso of patients with zzso In order to study abnormal zzso in tumor zzso an innovative technology zzso has been developed that allows to efficiently identify new markers with diagnostic zzso Test systems of molecular genetic and zzso markers for early diagnosis and prognosis as well as for cancer therapy zzso have shown to be effective, have been approved for use in clinical practice and are being introduced into practical zzso
