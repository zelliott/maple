Recent research has revealed the existence of specific zzso in zzso These zzso are being investigated as targets to find subjects at high risk for cancer, to detect early cancer, to detect the early recurrence of established cancer, and to find zzso These zzso are reviewed for the major zzso zzso Some of the clinical issues related to the application of these zzso and the limitations of using molecular targets are also zzso Current methods for determining the risk of cancer are zzso zzso assessment is essential for defining zzso for zzso and other zzso The concept of using surrogate zzso and functional sites for zzso risk is zzso Finally, the increasing complexity of molecular genetic analysis and the zzso zzso of cancer are discussed in relation to early zzso
