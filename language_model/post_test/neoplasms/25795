We calculated the short-term and long-term risks of developing cancer among zzso patients with a diagnosis of zzso melanoma in zzso in Sweden from 1958 to zzso In total, zzso patients developed a primary cancer at any site compared with an expected number of 177 zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients below 60 years of age at diagnosis had the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall risks were similar between men and zzso The highest risk was seen during the first year of zzso though the risk remained elevated also after 15 or more years of zzso For specific sites, the highest zzso was found for developing invasive zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso The risk of subsequent primary zzso skin cancer was elevated zzso in men and almost zzso in zzso An elevated risk was also found for female breast cancer zzso zzso zzso Especially among women, other sites with increased cancer risk (though not zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple myeloma zzso and zzso of the colon zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, patients with melanoma in zzso run a generally increased risk of developing primary zzso especially zzso zzso melanoma and zzso skin zzso The increased long-term risk of cancer after diagnosis of melanoma in zzso may be due to continuing zzso exposure or to intrinsic tumor zzso
