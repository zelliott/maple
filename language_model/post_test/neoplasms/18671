Originally implicated in the regulation of survival, proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells, the zzso zzso has also been linked to zzso zzso growth control and maintenance of zzso in a variety of other cells and zzso Although it remains a complex system, its relative simplicity and the availability of molecular data makes it particularly attractive for zzso zzso In this review, we will focus on zzso zzso in the context of cancer and present efforts to investigate zzso dynamics with the help of mathematical zzso We describe the zzso zzso that zzso a systems biology approach and give an example for zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso
