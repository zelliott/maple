In the iron and steel industry, workers are potentially exposed to a number of zzso and are involved in a number of processes of a hazardous zzso The cancer morbidity of iron and steel workers from modern plants in a developing country is zzso 

Cancer morbidity at two Korean iron and steel complexes was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso Work histories were merged with the national cancer registry for zzso workers who were followed from zzso 

Four hundred zzso zzso in zzso of the population, were diagnosed over 14 zzso Based on national cancer rates, the cohort exhibited a healthy worker effect for all cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reflecting relative good health, particularly for lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stomach cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and liver cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lung cancer morbidity was significantly elevated at the affiliated plants versus the parent plants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso morbidity was significantly elevated for maintenance workers compared to office and production workers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso was higher in the zzso plants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stomach cancer zzso was higher in the maintenance departments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This recent zzso cohort exhibits possible excess cancer morbidity in some processing zzso Further follow-up of this cohort and alternate study designs such as zzso study will be needed to zzso the relationship of exposure and health risks of iron and steel zzso
