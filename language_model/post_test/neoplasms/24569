zzso of human zzso is accompanied by vascular events, such as formation and zzso of blood vessels and systemic zzso Though long appreciated as zzso of cancer zzso zzso vascular involvement is increasingly recognized as a central zzso mechanism of tumor growth, invasion and zzso The major outstanding question in relation to this role has been, whether vascular zzso are simply a reaction to the conditions of the tumor zzso or are linked to the known genetic zzso zzso for the onset and progression of zzso In this regard, we have previously hypothesized, and recently demonstrated zzso that deregulation of certain zzso mechanisms, namely zzso of tissue factor zzso and possibly other changes zzso expression of zzso zzso - zzso are controlled by zzso zzso events, such as zzso of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene in various human cancer zzso It appears that these respective transforming zzso exert their impact on both, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may cause a systemic zzso zzso Other zzso which more recently emerged as regulators of cancer zzso include: zzso zzso and zzso While the spectrum of zzso targets of these genes may vary somewhat it includes: zzso zzso zzso and possibly other zzso zzso It is noteworthy that these zzso changes may impact the zzso process directly zzso stimulate zzso tumor growth or zzso as a consequence of both zzso and zzso zzso The latter are mostly related to cellular signaling events and changes in gene expression which are now known to be induced by the zzso complex, zzso and zzso expressed on the surface of cancer cells, as well as zzso zzso Interestingly, certain zzso possess zzso and zzso properties zzso zzso an observation that further suggests that zzso may act as an zzso mechanism of genetically driven tumor zzso zzso we suggest that zzso zzso zzso agents could, at least in some cases, zzso not only cellular transformation itself, but also some of the chronic components of the zzso zzso something that may be relevant to therapeutic efficacy of these zzso We also zzso that since zzso is the zzso target, circulating zzso zzso could serve as surrogate marker of the biological activity zzso agents exert in zzso Thus, both genetic and zzso factors appear to conspire to activate various components of the zzso system in cancer patients, both locally and zzso These activities act as zzso of cancer zzso zzso zzso and other events involved in disease progression and should be recognized in designing better zzso zzso
