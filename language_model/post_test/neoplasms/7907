zzso zzso were used in an indirect zzso zzso to investigate 83 zzso of zzso or zzso zzso for expression of the zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All but one zzso containing tumor cells according to the evaluation of zzso preparations were positive for one, two or all three zzso the exception being a zzso zzso Three of 5 cases, suspicious by routine zzso exhibited marker expression in a different number of cells and thus confirmed the zzso zzso Five of 63 zzso negative zzso exhibited single cells or small cell clusters positive for up to three zzso Four of these patients were found to suffer from zzso cancer, as established by clinical follow-up and subsequent biopsy or autopsy, zzso zzso syndrome and zzso zzso were diagnosed and confirmed by autopsy in one of the zzso positive cases with negative zzso The comparatively strong zzso expression in some zzso cells of this patient might have been induced by abnormal stimulation due to the rheumatic zzso The results of this study encourage wider use of zzso as an adjunct to zzso diagnosis in zzso
