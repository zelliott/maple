The structural proteins zzso 18 zzso and its zzso complementary partner zzso are expressed in a variety of adult zzso zzso and may play a role in zzso In this study, we focused on the biological functions of zzso which is thought to zzso zzso signaling and operates in conjunction with various related zzso zzso may affect zzso through several signaling zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso acts as an identical target of zzso in the zzso zzso and of zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, and regulation of zzso by zzso is involved in zzso zzso Finally, we discuss the importance of gaining a more complete understanding of the expression of zzso during zzso and suggest potential clinical applications of that zzso
