Many viruses have documented zzso activity, with the first evidence observed clinically over a decade zzso In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the field of zzso zzso zzso may be innately zzso lacking the ability to cause disease in people or they may require engineering to allow selective tumor targeting and zzso of zzso Following infection of a zzso cell, several events may occur, including direct viral zzso zzso zzso cell death and zzso cellular zzso Of late, a large body of work has recognized the ability of zzso viruses zzso to activate the innate and zzso immune system, as well as directly killing zzso The production of viruses expressing zzso zzso for zzso zzso factors, zzso molecules and zzso zzso has been able to further incite immune responses against target zzso Multiple zzso are now in the advanced stages of clinical trials, with several individual viruses having completed their respective trials with positive zzso This review introduces the multiple mechanisms by which zzso are able to act as an zzso therapy, either on their own or in combination with other more traditional treatment zzso The full benefit and the place where zzso will be integrated into zzso therapies will be determined with ongoing studies ranging from the laboratory to the zzso With various different viruses now in the clinic this therapeutic option is beginning to prove its worth, and the versatility of these agents means further innovative and novel applications will continue to be zzso
