To efficiently construct a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso gene driven by vascular zzso growth factor zzso promoter using an zzso system and observe its killing effect on zzso cells in zzso 

The CD gene was amplified by zzso and zzso were cloned in zzso bacteria, and then zzso into zzso to obtain zzso which was then zzso by zzso zzso the CD zzso with zzso site zzso zzso into the zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso to generate zzso After zzso with zzso zzso was transformed into zzso cells, and the zzso were selected on LB zzso plates containing 25 zzso zzso followed by identification of the positive zzso with zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso was then zzso with zzso zzso into zzso cells to produce the zzso zzso zzso which was finally confirmed by zzso The positive zzso zzso were zzso into zzso cells to observe their in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was constructed with a success rate of zzso After being packaged in zzso cells and zzso by zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso reached as high as zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was further confirmed by zzso zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso remarkably inhibited the growth of zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso containing CD gene under the control of zzso promoter can be efficiently generated using the zzso system, and exhibit potent zzso effect in zzso
