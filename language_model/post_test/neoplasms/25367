One hundred and zzso cultured human tumor cell lines derived from Caucasian patients were surveyed for ten of their zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso in this cell line population were similar to those of normal Caucasian zzso although consistent differences in zzso zzso were detected at each of the zzso All 10 zzso showed fewer zzso zzso and a zzso greater number of the common and rare zzso zzso than occur in normal Caucasian zzso On the average, only zzso of the zzso expressed in fully differentiated zzso cells were expressed in the zzso cell lines adapted to in zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the proportion of zzso expressed in cells that had been zzso less than 10 times and in cells zzso more than 50 zzso zzso it appears that there is a loss of expression in genetic marker zzso from at least six different zzso This loss occurs either in the in zzso tumor or in the very early stages of the zzso of zzso cells derived from solid human zzso Once the cells have become adapted to growth in zzso the patterns of expression in their zzso zzso remain stable for many zzso
