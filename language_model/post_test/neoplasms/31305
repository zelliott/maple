To improve the spatial resolution and contrast of zzso zzso imaging, we used a low-energy zzso and two zzso windows with a zzso zzso scatter compensation zzso The spatial resolution is better than with a zzso zzso and the zzso method can correct for scattered photons and reduce the background zzso In a phantom study and a clinical study involving 44 patients, the images obtained by the proposed method were compared with the images obtained with a zzso zzso and three energy windows without scatter compensation (the conventional zzso The spatial resolution and the counts were zzso Two nuclear medicine physicians interpreted the images and clinical usefulness was zzso The spatial resolution and contrast were improved by our proposed zzso It enabled the detection of zzso in five locations in the clinical zzso The counts were reduced but zzso were not zzso We conclude that our proposed method shows a clinical advantage over the conventional zzso It can be used easily and quickly with commercially available equipment and is useful in clinical zzso
