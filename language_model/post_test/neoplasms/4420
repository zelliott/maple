This review describes statistical models for the biological interaction of zzso genes and environmental zzso as observed in zzso zzso The importance of zzso transformation of industrial zzso and the potential role of genetic zzso in zzso zzso activity are zzso Several genetic zzso have been associated with cancer risk, but the link with the relevant zzso has only infrequently been zzso For example, studies show that slow zzso increased zzso cancer risk among workers exposed to some zzso as found among dye workers in England, but that this effect does not hold for zzso zzso This link of a genetic zzso factor with cancer risk due to some aromatic zzso but not to others, illustrated the specific nature of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies to investigate the role of genetic zzso in cancer development promise to further the identification of human zzso by focusing on susceptible individuals and, in turn, to enhance understanding of human cancer by relating cancer risk in populations to underlying zzso zzso Occupational studies are key to this zzso
