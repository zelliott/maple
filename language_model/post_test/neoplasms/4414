We investigated whether zzso in the zzso tumor zzso gene alter zzso sensitivity and/or repair of zzso DNA damage in primary human skin zzso from patients with zzso syndrome, zzso for zzso in one zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso expressing only zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells were more resistant than the zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and exhibited less zzso zzso DNA repair analysis revealed reduced removal of zzso zzso zzso from overall zzso DNA in zzso in zzso zzso cells compared with zzso zzso or normal zzso However, zzso zzso cells retained the ability to zzso repair damage in the transcribed strands of expressed genes zzso zzso These results suggest that loss of zzso function may lead to greater zzso instability by reducing the efficiency of DNA repair but that cellular resistance to zzso agents may be enhanced through elimination of zzso
