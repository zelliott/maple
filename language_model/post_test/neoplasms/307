The successful use of zzso for tumor therapy depends to a major extent on the ability to achieve a high concentration of zzso in the tumor relative to other zzso zzso not involved by zzso such as bone zzso zzso zzso liver, and zzso zzso designed to achieve such differential zzso of the zzso include the use of zzso that enter specific zzso pathways unique to certain tumor zzso zzso zzso that attach to zzso zzso present on tumor cell zzso zzso zzso that attach to zzso zzso present on tumor cell surfaces and which are then identified by zzso zzso directed against the species in which the original, zzso zzso was made, and zzso compounds injected regionally at the tumor zzso Although both clinical and experimental evidence on the use of zzso for tumor therapy is encouraging in preliminary studies, extensive further research needs to be done in this area to insure the clinical efficacy of zzso for tumor zzso
