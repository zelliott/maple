Several sets of male mice were given dietary zzso over a series of experiments performed during a nine year zzso Overall, zzso mice aged zzso months at sacrifice had significantly fewer tumors with lower severity than similarly aged control zzso The studies were originally designed to explore the potential of this agent for reducing the rate of onset of some genetic zzso of brain zzso When these animals were sacrificed they were routinely examined for overt evidence of tumors and when these were found, a note was made of their zzso and of their zzso zzso are commonly found during zzso of several strains of zzso Since zzso was not the original intent of the study, these observations were recorded but not pursued in greater zzso In this report, these data have now been collated and zzso This analysis has the disadvantage that tumor origin and zzso were not zzso However, the study also has the advantage of being conducted over an extended period of time with many groups of zzso In consequence, many extraneous factors, which could be potential zzso such as seasonal or dietary variations, are unlikely to have zzso with the zzso The use of more than one mouse strain strengthens the possibility that the findings may have general zzso Both aged and young animals were included in the original experiments but the tumor zzso in animals younger than 25 months was very zzso
