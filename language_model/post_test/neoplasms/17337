Patients are commonly referred to cancer zzso services when all affected family members are zzso This makes genetic testing and risk assessment more difficult, reducing the benefit from screening and zzso zzso 

zzso retrospective, cohort study of 508 randomly selected patients referred to a regional cancer zzso unit, using review of case notes to explore whether a simple clinical zzso 2, zzso family history rule could have been used to improve timely and appropriate referrals for genetic zzso The 3, 2, 1 criteria are: three affected relatives with the zzso zzso across two generations, with at least one person affected age zzso zzso 

Most zzso zzso genetic risk assessment referrals were in unaffected individuals and zzso zzso of these were referred after all affected family members had died, including zzso zzso who lost their last remaining affected relative in the previous zzso Most zzso zzso referrals met all 3, 2, 1 criteria, and zzso of these could have been made earlier in clinical zzso A further zzso zzso met two of the three zzso 

Using a simple zzso 2, zzso family rule in cancer care and particularly in zzso care could enable earlier cancer genetic risk assessment for unaffected relatives, improving the potential to benefit from targeted screening and zzso
