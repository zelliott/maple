zzso is a zzso zzso which reduces the zzso agent's adverse reactions without reducing zzso Our objectives were to determine the adverse zzso zzso toxicity zzso and the maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso 

zzso patients with advanced disease of the gastrointestinal system were included in the zzso All patients had been zzso with standard chemotherapy according to established zzso At entry, all patients had zzso or progressive disease zzso IV gastrointestinal zzso zzso gastric and zzso Six zzso dose levels zzso zzso 150 zzso 200 zzso 250 zzso 300 zzso and 350 zzso were set and at least 3 patients were included at each zzso Eight patients were treated at 300 zzso zzso The treatment was given once weekly for 8 zzso 

No serious zzso were observed at the first 4 dose levels zzso zzso At levels 5 and 6, mild zzso and zzso were zzso The most common adverse reaction was grade 2-3 peripheral zzso observed in all 4 patients treated at 350 zzso The 350 zzso dose level was therefore considered as zzso and the 300 zzso level as the zzso Of the 27 patients, 3 achieved partial response and 18 had stable disease for 4 months, zzso zzso zzso 

The most common toxicity was peripheral zzso at the 300 and 350 zzso dose zzso zzso was zzso and greatly reduced all the other zzso of zzso especially zzso and gastrointestinal tract zzso These preliminary results showed adequate effectiveness in zzso zzso
