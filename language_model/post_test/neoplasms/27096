Heat shock protein 70 zzso zzso is a zzso protein which protects individual cells from zzso shock and the whole zzso from zzso viral and zzso zzso These diverse functions may depend upon zzso activity that allows zzso to regulate the mechanism of damaged protein recovery or zzso inside a cell and to be a potent zzso stimulating immune activity against a variety of viral or zzso zzso The aim of this review is to present recent data on specific roles of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The data presented in this paper show that zzso zzso protects cancer cells of different origins from a variety of zzso threats including cancer cell zzso In contrast, however, zzso released from stressed cancer cells can serve as a danger signal or may recruit cells responsible for the generation of innate and zzso immune responses against zzso zzso
