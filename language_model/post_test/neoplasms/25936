zzso is a zzso dye analogue which zzso accumulates in zzso cell zzso It is zzso to a range of zzso In this phase I study, zzso was administered as a five-day infusion once every three zzso 

Ten patients, median age 59 zzso years, with advanced solid zzso were treated at three dose zzso 30, 40 and 50 zzso for a total of 18 zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso was used to evaluate the effect of zzso on skeletal muscle zzso zzso 

The zzso toxicity was zzso zzso functional zzso impairment zzso 2, two zzso One patient with zzso cancer attained stable disease and the remainder progressive zzso There were no MRS changes in the first or second treatment cycles but one patient received 11 treatment cycles and developed changes consistent with a zzso zzso Mean values for all zzso parameters were at zzso zzso levels and did not exceed zzso values zzso or zzso 1 zzso 

Because of the zzso zzso and animal studies showing zzso causes eventual irreversible zzso zzso further recruitment was zzso The study shows, however, that it is feasible to target zzso with zzso zzso if drugs with higher therapeutic zzso could be zzso
