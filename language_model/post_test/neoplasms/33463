zzso of gap zzso zzso communication zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso pathways are common hallmarks of zzso derived cancer zzso We previously determined that the zzso and not the zzso zzso of zzso which are prominent cigarette smoke zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso in zzso rat liver zzso zzso Using these same cells, we show that an immediate upstream response to zzso was a rapid zzso zzso release of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso C prevented the zzso of zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso specific zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D, protein zzso C, and zzso protein zzso had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso zzso of protein zzso A also prevented zzso of zzso by zzso zzso measurement of zzso zzso C and zzso indicated that only zzso zzso C was activated in response to zzso while zzso had no zzso zzso also activated zzso activated protein zzso however, like zzso zzso its zzso was not involved in zzso regulation of zzso and this zzso was independent of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso activated protein zzso were zzso Western zzso analyzes indicated no change in zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso C is an important zzso in the induction of a zzso zzso namely the zzso of zzso whereas zzso activated protein zzso triggered in response to zzso were not involved in the deregulation of zzso
