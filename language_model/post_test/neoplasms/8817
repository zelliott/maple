From zzso organisms to humans, cells have evolved elegant systems to facilitate careful folding of proteins and the maintenance of protein zzso Key zzso of protein zzso include a large, zzso family of proteins known as molecular zzso which augment the folding of nascent zzso and temper adverse consequences of cellular zzso However, errors in protein folding can still occur, resulting in the zzso of zzso proteins that strain cellular quality-control zzso In some cases, zzso proteins can be targeted for degradation by the zzso or via zzso Nevertheless, protein zzso is a feature of many complex, genetically and clinically zzso diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and zzso In recent years, substantial progress has been made in unraveling the complexity of protein folding using model systems, and we are now closer to being able to diagnose and treat the growing number of zzso zzso To showcase some of these important recent advances, and also to inspire discussion on approaches to tackle unanswered questions, Disease Models & zzso zzso presents a special collection of reviews from researchers at the cutting-edge of the zzso
