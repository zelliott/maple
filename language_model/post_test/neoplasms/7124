In many clinical trials patients are zzso assessed for the transition to an intermediate state, such as occurrence of a zzso nonfatal event, and zzso zzso of the distribution of nonfatal event free survival time, that is, the time to the first occurrence of the nonfatal event or death, is the primary focus of the data zzso The difficulty with this zzso is that the intermittent assessment of patients results in two forms of zzso the times of occurrence of nonfatal events are zzso censored and, when a nonfatal event does not occur by the time of the last assessment, a patient's nonfatal event status is not known from the time of the last assessment until the end of follow-up for zzso We consider both forms of incompleteness within the framework of an zzso zzso We develop zzso maximum likelihood zzso zzso in an zzso model from zzso observations with missing status of intermediate zzso We show that the zzso zzso are zzso and propose an zzso for obtaining zzso This work thus provides new methodology for the analysis of incomplete data that arise from clinical zzso We apply this methodology to the data from a recently reported cancer clinical trial zzso et zzso 2006, New England Journal of zzso zzso and compare our zzso results with those obtained using a Food and Drug Administration recommended zzso
