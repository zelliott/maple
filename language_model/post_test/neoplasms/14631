zzso studies were carried out on peripheral zzso from cancer patients at different times after therapy with zzso The frequency of sister zzso exchange zzso was increased markedly shortly after treatment, and then declined to near zzso levels over a four-week zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso frequency induced by zzso is reduced slowly in resting zzso zzso and considerably faster in zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that measurement of zzso is useful for the study of zzso zzso damage in zzso cells, but is less suitable for the detection of persistent, zzso zzso long after zzso The frequency of zzso aberrations in a cohort of 50 patients with zzso zzso was increased for up to ten years after zzso zzso The zzso aberrations were zzso zzso marker zzso and cells with zzso complex zzso The frequency distribution of zzso involved in aberrations was studied in cells from some of the zzso An overrepresentation of zzso 8 and 9 was found in these cells, whereas the X zzso was overrepresented in cells from control zzso An increased frequency of zzso zzso was found in long-term cultures of zzso from three of the patients, indicating that these aberrations are compatible with cell survival and zzso Seven patients in the cohort developed a second, primary zzso during the observation zzso The zzso and types of aberrations in these patients were similar to those of the other patients in the zzso
