Previously, a specific zzso zzso zzso discovered in urine and serum of zzso mice, was reported to zzso block tumor growth and zzso in animal zzso zzso of zzso and its precursor proteins in urine from cancer patients has not been zzso Now, we report the development of an zzso analysis system that allows us to detect zzso and zzso zzso in the urine of cancer zzso The detection system is a combination of a novel zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis using a specific zzso to human zzso and zzso High levels of zzso were detected in the urine from various cancer patients, whereas healthy individuals showed relatively low levels of urine zzso Of interest, zzso is zzso in urine samples of patients with various zzso including acute zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may play an important role in the development and progression of zzso Our data for the first time show that zzso and zzso are present at relatively high levels in the urine of human cancer zzso zzso of urine zzso in cancer patients helps us not only to understand the role of this zzso inhibitor in cancer development and progression but also allows us to develop tools of cancer diagnosis and zzso Thus zzso has both therapeutic and diagnostic implications in cancer zzso
