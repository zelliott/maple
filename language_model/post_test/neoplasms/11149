zzso in zzso zzso zzso is less severe in patients expressing some zzso or normal zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, determined whether expression of residual zzso zzso activity also protected against zzso development in zzso 

From a total of 296 consecutive genetically confirmed zzso patients from the British zzso and the Netherlands, we identified 66 patients who developed a zzso zzso 47 zzso zzso and 19 zzso zzso were zzso We determined their zzso zzso and whether cells from these patients expressed any zzso with residual zzso zzso zzso 

In childhood, total absence of zzso zzso activity was zzso almost exclusively, with development of zzso zzso There was an overwhelming preponderance of zzso in patients zzso years without zzso activity compared with those with some residual activity, consistent with a substantial protective effect of residual zzso zzso activity against zzso development in zzso In addition, the presence of eight breast zzso in zzso patients, a zzso increased risk, establishes breast cancer as part of the zzso zzso 

Overall, a spectrum of zzso types is associated with zzso consistent with involvement of zzso in different mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso type was influenced by zzso zzso zzso residual zzso zzso activity and zzso
