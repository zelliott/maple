Cell banking of zzso stem cells zzso from various human zzso has significantly increased the feasibility of zzso zzso Sources such as zzso tissue and zzso offer outstanding possibilities for zzso transplantation due to their high differentiation potential and their ability to zzso immune zzso zzso however, concern the reduced zzso potential as a result of progressive zzso zzso which zzso zzso production and long-term analysis of these zzso Here we report the establishment and characterization of two human zzso and two human zzso SC lines immortalized by zzso expression of the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in continuously growing SC lines that were largely zzso concerning surface marker profile, zzso zzso and zzso capacity with similar or enhanced differentiation potential for up to 87 population zzso While all generated lines showed equal zzso compared to the parental cells, one of the zzso immortalized lines resulted in significantly increased zzso Although zzso proves as important tool for zzso cells, our data emphasize the need for careful and standardized characterization of each individual cell population for cell zzso
