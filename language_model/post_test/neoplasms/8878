During the last decade, various functional zzso materials with interesting zzso magnetic, mechanical and chemical properties have been extensively applied to biomedical areas including imaging, diagnosis and zzso In zzso most research has focused on the application of zzso as potential delivery vehicles for drugs and zzso because zzso in the size range of zzso zzso can interact with biological systems at the molecular level, and allow targeted delivery and passage through biological zzso Recent investigations have even revealed that several kinds of zzso are zzso zzso Not only can they passively interact with cells, but they can also actively mediate molecular processes to regulate cell zzso This can be seen in the treatment of cancer via zzso mechanisms as well as the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by effectively controlling zzso zzso This review will present recent applications of zzso zzso as therapeutic agents in the treatment of zzso
