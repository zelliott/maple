We assessed the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of Internet-based zzso compared with conventional microscopic zzso A total of 96 cases from the routine workload of the Department of zzso at the zzso Hospital in Uganda were examined by robotic zzso via the Internet at the zzso Hospital in zzso The zzso diagnoses were compared with those of conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to exchange clinical and diagnostic zzso The reference diagnosis zzso zzso was established by consensus between two or more experienced zzso using both conventional zzso and zzso zzso was used whenever it was zzso It took approximately 30 zzso for a pathologist to learn to use the zzso system and zzso zzso to read a case zzso Internet speed was the main limiting zzso The images were of good quality and the pathologist at the remote site was able to navigate through the slide and change the zzso as zzso In 92 of the specimens zzso the zzso at the two hospitals agreed exactly about the zzso zzso overall was moderate zzso zzso zzso The zzso diagnoses were attributed to factors related to diseases zzso difficult to zzso such as soft tissue zzso and primitive zzso Internet-based conferencing systems offer an inexpensive method of obtaining a primary diagnosis by zzso and consulting on cases that require zzso zzso
