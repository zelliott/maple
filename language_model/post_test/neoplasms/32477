To investigate the accuracy of total body water zzso predicted by zzso zzso zzso compared with a zzso oxide dilution technique in zzso zzso receiving zzso 

zzso zzso 

Two private Australian radiation zzso zzso 

In all, 27 subjects zzso zzso four zzso mean age 62 zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was measured using a zzso oxide dilution technique and predicted using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Tokyo, Japan, Models zzso 410 and zzso 

The mean zzso values for predicted and measured zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, indicating a mean bias to zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, a significant negative correlation between the mean of the zzso of zzso and their difference zzso zzso indicates a progressive zzso of zzso by zzso zzso as the water content of the body zzso The analysis of zzso limits of agreement zzso zzso showed that for most individuals the zzso predicted by zzso zzso can vary as much as 12 zzso above or zzso zzso below the actual zzso measured by a zzso oxide dilution zzso 

There is good agreement between zzso zzso zzso with a gold standard technique at the group zzso However, the significant correlation between the difference of predicted and measured zzso and the wide limits of agreement between the two methods, indicates that the use of zzso zzso in assessing zzso may lead to unacceptable error in zzso
