Metallic compounds and other agents used in the manufacturing of glass are probably responsible for the cancer risks observed for zzso especially zzso Few hygienic observations have been reported from the art glass zzso Three zzso were therefore studied with regard to air zzso of lead, zzso zzso and zzso The hygienic conditions of the zzso were investigated at these zzso and another two with regard to inside deposits of slag containing lead, zzso zzso and zzso as possible zzso that cause oral zzso Atomic zzso zzso was used for the zzso Apart from lead, the metal zzso in the air were around the detection zzso zzso producing heavy crystal glass usually had higher zzso of lead in the air than the zzso zzso Seven out of 12 samples from heavy crystal zzso exceeded the Swedish threshold limit of 50 zzso while only four out of 28 samples from the zzso zzso exceeded this zzso Regarding metals in the slag from inside the zzso the zzso zzso zzso of lead and zzso were higher in the heavy crystal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso slag versus zzso zzso zzso slag and zzso zzso zzso slag in zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso was similarly low in the pipes from all the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the concentration of zzso was only slightly higher in heavy crystal zzso zzso zzso slag versus zzso zzso slag in zzso zzso
