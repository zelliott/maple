The possibility of free radical reactions occurring in biological processes led to the development and employment of novel methods and techniques focused on determining their existence and importance in normal and pathological zzso For this reason the use of zzso for spin zzso free zzso became widespread in the 1970s and 1980s, when surprisingly the first evidence of their potent biological properties was zzso Since then widespread exploration and demonstration of the potent biological properties of zzso zzso and its derivatives took place in zzso models of septic shock and then in experimental zzso The most extensive commercial effort made to capitalize on the potent properties of the zzso was for acute zzso zzso This occurred during zzso when the zzso zzso zzso called zzso in the stroke studies, was shown to be safe in humans and was taken all the way through clinical phase 3 trials and then was deemed to be zzso As summarized in this review, because of its excellent human safety profile, zzso zzso now called zzso in the cancer studies, was tested as an zzso agent in several zzso zzso models and shown to be very zzso Based on these studies this compound is now scheduled to enter into early clinical trials for zzso zzso this zzso The potential use of zzso in combination with zzso compounds such as the zzso zzso zzso is discussed for zzso zzso as well as for various other indications leading to zzso such as aging, septic zzso and malaria zzso There is much more research and development activity ongoing for various indications with the zzso alone or in combination with other active compounds, as briefly noted in this zzso
