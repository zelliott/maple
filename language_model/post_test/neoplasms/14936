Imaging agents that enable direct zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso have great potential value for monitoring zzso response as well as for early diagnosis and disease zzso We describe here the development of zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso that zzso label active zzso in zzso We used these zzso to monitor zzso in the zzso of mice treated with zzso as well as in zzso mice treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provided direct zzso of the zzso of zzso in live mice, whole zzso and tissue zzso The zzso produced a maximum fluorescent signal that could be monitored zzso and that coincided with the peak in zzso activity, as measured by gel zzso Overall, these studies demonstrate that zzso zzso have the potential to be used for zzso imaging of zzso in both zzso and clinical zzso
