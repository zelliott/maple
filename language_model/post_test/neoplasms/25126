The relevance of zzso as a zzso zzso is evident from the fact that more than 50% of the human zzso hold zzso in the gene coding for zzso and of the remaining zzso a considerable number have zzso in the zzso zzso From its discovery 30 years ago, the importance of zzso as an essential zzso factor for zzso suppression has become zzso More recently, new and seemingly diverse roles of zzso have been zzso It soon became clear that zzso interactions play an important role in the regulation of the zzso function at different zzso Here we review the contribution by zzso zzso and his group towards understanding the basis and functional relevance of zzso zzso zzso and the important role that protein science, zzso and structural biology have played in the science produced in the Centre for zzso Engineering over the zzso
