Human zzso function as a protective structure capping both ends of the zzso They are composed of long, repetitive sequences of zzso associated with a variety of zzso zzso zzso protect the zzso from zzso fusion, zzso and degradation, all events that can lead to cell zzso At cell zzso zzso cannot be completely zzso They are gradually zzso and when the zzso reach a critical zzso cell replication is arrested in what is called zzso zzso Thus, zzso act as an intrinsic zzso mechanism of the cell's aging zzso zzso is an zzso zzso complex that acts as a reverse zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso activity is almost absent in zzso cells, but it is detected in embryonic stem cells and in the vast majority of tumor zzso zzso cells, in fact, may contain short and stable zzso that zzso zzso to the cancer cells, which are thus able to replicate zzso The deregulation of zzso thus plays an important role in the relationship between premature aging syndrome and zzso This review describes the recent advances in the molecular characterization of zzso the regulation of zzso
