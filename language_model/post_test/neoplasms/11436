zzso studies have provided growing evidence of a link between zzso and cancer zzso 

To review the evidence from zzso studies and cohort studies on a possible association between zzso zzso zzso and cancer risk, with particular attention to the case definition of zzso 

Studies with quantitative data on the association between zzso zzso disease) and cancer risk were obtained from zzso in combination with a review of cited zzso 

In 23 publications, zzso was implicated in the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adult zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) and different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso skin zzso zzso 2) and brain zzso zzso zzso zzso The overall picture of the results of these studies shows that a history of zzso may be associated with a decreased risk of pancreatic cancer, brain zzso and childhood zzso although in most instances the findings were not statistically zzso No consistent associations were observed for skin cancer or zzso The definition of zzso had varying quality, and was imprecise in the majority of zzso 

The findings of the zzso studies tend to support a lower risk of cancer among persons with a history of zzso Although a more careful definition of zzso is needed, these zzso studies could provide an estimate of the background cancer risk in patients with zzso when the long-term effects of treatments for zzso are zzso
