We propose a zzso zzso model for the zzso zzso in the spreading of tumor zzso By using a continuous time random walk zzso we formulate a system of the balance equations for the cancer cells of two zzso with random switching between cell proliferation and zzso The transport process is formulated in terms of the zzso with an arbitrary zzso distribution zzso zzso is modeled by a standard zzso zzso We apply zzso zzso and zzso zzso to determine the overall rate of tumor cell zzso In particular, we take into account both normal diffusion and anomalous transport zzso in order to show that the standard diffusion approximation for migration leads to zzso of the overall cancer spreading zzso
