The purpose of this paper is to use zzso based zzso models to demonstrate that if toxic response is a function of the time profile in zzso time of the concentration of the toxic zzso in the target zzso then the appropriate zzso zzso law for toxic compounds which are metabolically zzso is zzso zzso per unit of zzso time zzso zzso zzso At low dose rates this metric is approximately equivalent to zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso which are spontaneously zzso an approximate zzso zzso law is zzso zzso zzso
