The zzso family of DNA binding proteins was first recognized approximately 5 years zzso The founding members, zzso Bright and zzso dead zzso zzso were independently cloned on the basis of their ability to bind to zzso DNA zzso although neither zzso zzso a recognizable DNA binding zzso zzso of the respective binding activities revealed a shared but previously zzso DNA binding domain, the consensus sequence of which extends across approximately 100 zzso zzso This novel DNA binding domain was designated zzso interactive domain zzso based on the behavior of Bright and zzso The consensus sequence occurs in 13 distinct human proteins and in proteins from all zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso proteins were not cloned in the context of DNA binding activity, however, and their features as DNA binding proteins are only beginning to be zzso The zzso region itself shows more diversity in structure and function than the highly zzso consensus sequence zzso The basic structure appears to be a series of six zzso separated by zzso zzso or turns, but the structured region may extend to an additional zzso at either or both ends of the basic zzso It has also become apparent that the DNA binding activity of zzso proteins is not necessarily sequence zzso What is consistent is the evidence that family members play vital roles in the regulation of development and/or zzso gene zzso zzso expression of zzso proteins is also increasingly implicated in human zzso This review summarizes current knowledge about the structure and function of zzso family members, with a particular focus on the human zzso
