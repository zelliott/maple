zzso of zzso from organic chemicals residing in the subsurface into zzso buildings is known as vapor zzso Because of the difficulty in evaluating vapor intrusion by indoor air zzso models are often employed to determine if a potential indoor inhalation exposure zzso exists and, if such a zzso is complete, whether long-term exposure increases the zzso risk for cancer or other toxic effects to an unacceptable zzso For zzso vapor intrusion zzso moisture content is, at times, determined from soil zzso taken in open spaces between zzso However, there is little published information on how moisture content measured outside a building structure compares with the moisture content directly beneath the building - where the values are most critical for vapor intrusion zzso This research begins to address these issues by investigating the movement of soil moisture next to and beneath a building at a contaminated field site and determining the effect on vapor intrusion risk zzso A zzso zzso water flow model, zzso is used with 2 years of zzso local zzso data to simulate subsurface moisture content in the vicinity of a hypothetical 10 zzso zzso building slab at a contaminated field zzso These moisture content values are used in vapor intrusion risk assessment simulations using the Johnson and zzso model with instantaneous and averaged moisture zzso zzso show that vapor intrusion risk assessments based on moisture content determined from soil zzso taken external to a building structure may zzso underestimate the vapor intrusion risk from beneath the zzso zzso under the edges of a slab may be influenced by zzso events and may show reduced vapor intrusion risk as a zzso Data from a building zzso with zzso moisture zzso showed results similar to the zzso but with a smaller difference between the zzso and outside average moisture zzso These results indicate that, depending upon the point of vapor zzso into the structure and soil type, zzso cleanup zzso based on zzso or default moisture content values may not be zzso of exposure to organic zzso from below a zzso
