zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood donation, and zzso zzso zzso are three different methods to avoid zzso blood zzso during surgical zzso The controversial use of zzso via cell saver in zzso surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of zzso blood zzso in connection with radical zzso We investigated changes in the zzso resistance of the zzso red blood cells zzso bacterial contamination, changes in zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso 

After written informed zzso 24 patients who presented for radical zzso were randomly allocated to either a group that used zzso or a group that used zzso zzso The patients received zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and nitrous zzso The zzso parameters from the zzso period to the 3rd zzso day are shown in Table zzso The zzso 3 Plus Cell zzso was used for zzso 

Our results showed that the zzso zzso zzso factors, and serum chemistry did not differ between the two groups zzso zzso However, there were significant differences during the investigated zzso The zzso resistance of the salvaged zzso was higher than that zzso Furthermore, there were no zzso cells in the zzso salvaged zzso 

Our results showed no decrease in the quality of the zzso zzso urine was not zzso and there were no significant differences between the groups zzso Although there were no zzso cells in the salvaged blood, the possibility of blood zzso is zzso We concluded that because of the risk of infection of zzso blood products, zzso is a safe possibility to reduce the amount of zzso blood zzso required in connection with radical zzso
