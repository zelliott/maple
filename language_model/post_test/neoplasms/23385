zzso in biotechnology and zzso are providing a biological basis for the zzso of clinical course and response to treatment that have long been apparent to zzso The ability to zzso characterize human diseases presents new opportunities to develop more effective treatments and new challenges for the design and analysis of clinical zzso In zzso treatment of broad populations with regimens that benefit a minority of patients is less economically sustainable with expensive zzso targeted zzso The established molecular zzso of human diseases requires the development of new zzso for the design and analysis of zzso clinical trials as a reliable basis for zzso zzso We review prospective designs for the development of new zzso and zzso zzso to inform their zzso We cover designs for a wide range of zzso At one extreme is the development of a new drug with a single candidate zzso and strong biological evidence that marker negative patients are unlikely to benefit from the new zzso At the other extreme are Phase III clinical trials involving both zzso discovery of a zzso zzso and internal validation of that zzso We have outlined a zzso approach to the analysis of zzso clinical trials that both preserves the Type I error and provides a reliable internally validated basis for predicting which patients are most likely or unlikely to benefit from the new zzso
