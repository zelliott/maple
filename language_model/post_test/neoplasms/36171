zzso evidence indicates that zzso zzso can function as zzso or tumor zzso genes by controlling few key targets, which in turn contribute to the zzso of zzso The identification of zzso key zzso interactions remains a zzso We performed a systematic analysis of known zzso key interactions manually curated from published papers based on different aspects including zzso expression and zzso Known zzso key interactions show more zzso binding sites (especially for zzso binding zzso more reliable binding of zzso to the target region, higher expression associations and broader functional coverage when compared to zzso zzso Through zzso these zzso expression and function features, we proposed a zzso approach termed zzso to prioritize zzso key zzso zzso zzso of our approach revealed that it can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of zzso zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated the performance of our zzso Using zzso as a case, we found that the top ranked interactions can account for most functions of zzso In addition, we further demonstrated the power of our approach by 23 recently identified zzso key zzso The approach described here offers a new way for the discovery of novel zzso key zzso zzso
