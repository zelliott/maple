Various zzso zzso acids show promising results in tumor zzso as applied in the management of cancer zzso We zzso the precursor zzso for easier kit labeling of zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis was zzso by experimental zzso Eight parameters were initially screened by a quarter fractional zzso The resulting most important parameters zzso temperature, zzso zzso were further zzso using a full zzso zzso zzso zzso The final conclusion for the optimal values for temperature, reaction time, and concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were 180 degrees C, 24 hours, 61 zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso 90 zzso 90 zzso and 100 zzso zzso The yield was increased from zzso to consistently more than zzso zzso zzso confirmation and quality control was performed by zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso phase zzso and zzso No zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso zzso of the obtained zzso was performed in kit conditions with zzso zzso resulting in a labeling yield of zzso zzso After zzso zzso a zzso purity of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso exchange reaction allows both routine kit preparation and zzso synthesis of zzso from zzso The reaction presents an interesting alternative for a cumbersome zzso zzso zzso
