Whether zzso treatment adversely affects survival is zzso 

To assess whether zzso drugs increase zzso 

zzso cohort study evaluating overall and cancer mortality in relation to zzso drug exposure among patients with zzso inflammatory zzso zzso clinical, and treatment data derived from medical records, and mortality results from United States National Death Index zzso The zzso mortality risk was compared with US vital statistics using zzso mortality zzso zzso and cancer mortality in relation to use or zzso of zzso drugs within the cohort was studied with survival zzso 

Five zzso zzso inflammation zzso Patients zzso US residents with zzso zzso zzso zzso of whom received zzso drugs during follow zzso zzso Use of zzso T cell zzso zzso agents, and zzso necrosis factor zzso 

zzso zzso cancer zzso 

Over 66 802 person years (17 zzso after exposure to zzso zzso zzso patients died zzso person zzso 230 zzso from zzso For patients zzso to zzso treatment, risks of death overall zzso mortality ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and from cancer zzso zzso to zzso were similar to those of the US zzso Patients who used zzso methotrexate, zzso zzso zzso systemic zzso or zzso had overall and cancer mortality similar to that of patients who never took zzso zzso In patients who used zzso overall mortality was not increased and cancer mortality was zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso were associated with increased overall zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and cancer mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

Most commonly used zzso drugs do not seem to increase overall or cancer zzso Our results suggesting that zzso necrosis factor zzso might increase mortality are less robust than the other zzso additional evidence is zzso
