Cancer is characterized by deregulation of cell proliferation and altered cell death zzso which zzso in almost all instances, the minimal common platform upon which all zzso evolution zzso The most implicit and clinically attractive zzso strategies, therefore, consist of eliminating tumor cells by preventing their expansion and ultimately inducing cell death zzso In this context, the zzso molecular assessment of tumor cell proliferation and zzso status using PET imaging constitutes a major strategy in zzso studies to assess the efficacy of new zzso zzso using small animal PET imaging, and in clinical settings for the monitoring of treatment responses in zzso For this purpose, a variety of PET zzso targeting specific molecular entities allowing the zzso measurement of biological zzso including cell proliferation and zzso are under development for use in zzso studies and clinical trials to zzso image in zzso the lifeline of zzso
