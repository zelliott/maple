zzso killer zzso cells are ex zzso expanded T cells with zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso They have recently been evaluated in a phase zzso clinical trial against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso redirect zzso cells to tumor targets, thus enhancing their zzso While zzso may improve zzso zzso zzso activity, little is known about the fate of zzso cells upon zzso to tumor targets using a zzso 

Using ex zzso zzso cells, zzso expressing breast and zzso cell lines and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the zzso activity and the zzso and zzso outcome of zzso zzso 

When redirected to tumor targets with zzso there was a significant increase in zzso activity as well as an increase in both zzso cell proliferation and zzso The addition of zzso zzso against zzso did not significantly increase proliferation or zzso of zzso cells redirected to zzso and zzso tumor zzso To attempt to reduce zzso zzso we incubated zzso cells in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso which led to a partial reduction in zzso zzso without increasing cellular zzso 

zzso are effective in zzso activated T cells to tumor targets and such zzso leads to both zzso proliferation and zzso that are not altered by zzso through zzso zzso cell zzso can be reduced by using a zzso inhibitor but this does not increase zzso cell zzso
