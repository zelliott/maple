As a result of a number of clinical management studies, zzso zzso tests such as zzso zzso Australia zzso zzso have been recommended to reduce zzso zzso zzso zzso Surveillance studies for new tests are zzso We zzso assessed zzso zzso in normal zzso 

zzso emergency patients and zzso zzso with zzso or zzso investigations were zzso zzso Investigation results and early chart review including zzso factors reducing specificity were zzso A latex zzso was also zzso Patients were followed for at least 3 months for zzso zzso 

Four hundred three patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed up) were zzso zzso sensitivity was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso specificity 38% zzso zzso zzso negative likelihood ratio, zzso and emergency specificity zzso zzso sensitivity was zzso zzso zzso recent operations, zzso status, and advanced age were associated with markedly reduced zzso zzso in older emergency patients zzso years old) and younger zzso zzso without zzso was zzso to zzso but sensitivity was maintained at zzso 

zzso zzso probably maintains adequate sensitivity in normal clinical practice for low- or even zzso zzso zzso zzso had poor zzso zzso is best in younger zzso emergency zzso These findings need validation in larger zzso surveillance zzso
