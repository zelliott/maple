zzso on properties of tumor cells are zzso On the basis on them the survival rate of tumor cells is described by the zzso function and the dependence of zzso probability zzso in the zzso zzso on the number survived tumor cells zzso zzso and on the total focal dose zzso is described by the zzso zzso An analysis of the above approach to the determination of zzso zzso resulted in designing a calculation method for zzso that can be used to estimate the zzso zzso as a function of its volume and zzso An zzso or zzso description of the zzso dependence for a fixed volume of zzso zzso is needed for the zzso of zzso There is no need to determine the cell structure of tissue or the zzso properties of its zzso The possibility to construct the zzso section function and to zzso thus, the volume of useful clinical data belongs to the zzso zzso
