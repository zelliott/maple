zzso zzso containing zzso groups zzso zzso with zzso zzso via a zzso bond zzso is a drug zzso that releases zzso in the zzso milieu of a zzso zzso has an apparent zzso of 40,000 and a zzso diameter of zzso but no apparent plasma protein zzso zzso possesses two mechanisms of selectivity toward solid tumors and has potent zzso zzso The first one is drug zzso in tumors that depends on the enhanced zzso and retention zzso effect, which results in a zzso times higher concentration of drug in the tumor than in normal zzso such as the heart, zzso and zzso This zzso in tumor tissue is in great contrast to that of conventional zzso zzso The second one is zzso release of drug from zzso this zzso released free zzso more efficiently at a lower zzso which exists in tumors, and exerts zzso zzso Free zzso is known for its much faster zzso into tumor cells compared with zzso Thus, in our in zzso study, zzso showed a higher zzso at the lower pH of tumor tissue than at the neutral pH of normal zzso Furthermore, much more zzso was liberated from the zzso in zzso tumor tissue than in normal zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso release in the tumor zzso led to highly zzso drug zzso which continued for more than zzso whereas the lowest free drug concentration was detected in normal zzso at zzso and no longer at a later zzso In conclusion, we determined in our study here that the zzso zzso zzso had an excellent zzso effect without appreciable adverse zzso
