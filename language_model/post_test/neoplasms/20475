An increased risk of lung zzso among asphalt workers has been suggested in zzso studies based on large scale statistical zzso 

In a zzso study of zzso male workers employed in road zzso asphalt mixing and zzso zzso ground and building construction workers and zzso other workers from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, with mortality that was documented from zzso zzso to zzso zzso coal zzso 4-6 ring zzso aromatic zzso organic zzso diesel zzso zzso and zzso dust were assessed via a zzso zzso zzso mortality ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso based on national mortality rates, as well as relative risks zzso based on zzso zzso models were zzso 

The zzso of lung cancer among workers exposed to zzso fume zzso zzso zzso zzso was comparable to that of zzso workers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso of zzso workers without exposure to coal zzso the zzso of lung cancer was zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis based on the zzso zzso zzso in the whole cohort did not suggest an increased lung cancer risk following exposure to zzso zzso However, in an analysis restricted to road zzso based on quantitative estimate of zzso fume exposure, a zzso was suggested for average level of exposure, applying a 15-year lag, which was marginally reduced after adjustment for zzso to coal zzso The results for cancer of the head and neck were similar to those of lung cancer, although they were based on a smaller number of zzso There was no clear suggestion of an association with zzso fume for any other zzso 

The results of the analysis by zzso fume exposure do not allow us to conclude on the presence or absence of a zzso link between exposure to zzso fume and risk of cancer of the lung and the head and zzso
