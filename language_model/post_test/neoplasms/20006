We develop zzso zzso and magnetic zzso zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the controlled release of the zzso zzso The novel dual zzso zzso is formulated to shield off target at pH zzso but bind avidly to tumor cells in zzso alleviating toxicity and side effects of the drug to normal zzso The mechanism involves zzso zzso surface charge switching by the zzso process of zzso molecules followed by zzso of zzso in zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso under near infrared zzso zzso induced the contraction of zzso zzso and, in turn, triggered burst release of zzso zzso electron zzso zzso zzso microscope zzso zzso transform infrared zzso X-ray zzso zzso vibrating sample zzso zzso dynamic light scattering zzso and zzso analyses were performed to characterize zzso properties of the zzso zzso The size range of the zzso zzso zzso after being zzso was from 130 to 150 zzso under simulated zzso zzso The high zzso efficiencies of zzso and zzso were zzso reaching 85 and 78 zzso % for zzso zzso zzso The tumor zzso rate of zzso reflected that the resulting zzso could be promising to treat cancer by specific binding and targeting release drug to zzso
