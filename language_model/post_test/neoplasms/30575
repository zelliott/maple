The dynamic zzso zzso zzso was performed by using zzso scanning following an intravenous zzso injection of contrast zzso zzso curve was applied for zzso zzso curve fitting and CT zzso values were applied for two compartment zzso The value of zzso zzso and zzso were defined as the blood flow factors in this zzso The inhalation of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso can be useful for determining regional tumor blood flow zzso CT and PET were performed in twelve zzso The diagnosis was zzso zzso in four, and zzso two liver zzso one focal zzso zzso of the liver, one zzso one zzso zzso one zzso melanoma, one zzso zzso one bone zzso The correlations among zzso zzso and zzso were good, and better correlations were obtained among tumor blood flow factors and zzso in the case of the tumors which existed far from air way and/or had low blood zzso The distance from air way zzso both the value of zzso and tumor blood flow zzso Both the distance from air way and pathology caused conflicting results between zzso and tumor blood flow zzso Dynamic CT was particularly useful for evaluated the blood flow of tumors that had contact with air zzso
