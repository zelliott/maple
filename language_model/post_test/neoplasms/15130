The zzso zzso protein zzso are critical regulators of human physiology that control an impressive array of diverse cellular functions, including the zzso of growth, survival, proliferation and zzso The zzso zzso family is comprised of three highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso knockout mice documented zzso zzso specific functions in the regulation of cellular growth, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Those studies establish that the functions of the different zzso zzso are not completely overlapping and that zzso signaling contributes to the diversity of zzso zzso However, despite these important advances, a thorough understanding about the specific roles of zzso family members and the molecular mechanisms that determine zzso zzso functional specificity will be essential to zzso the complexity of zzso regulated cellular processes and how zzso zzso deregulation might contribute to disease zzso Here, we zzso recent advances in understanding the roles of zzso zzso in the regulation of metabolism and cancer, and possible mechanisms contributing to zzso zzso functional zzso
