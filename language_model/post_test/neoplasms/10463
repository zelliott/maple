The key zzso of new vessel formation in cancer and other diseases is zzso zzso exists as alternatively spliced zzso - the zzso zzso family generated by zzso 8 zzso zzso and a sister family, termed zzso exemplified by zzso generated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, it is unknown whether this zzso property of zzso is a general property of the zzso family of zzso 

The zzso and protein expression of zzso was studied in human zzso The effect of zzso was zzso by zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso migration, zzso zzso zzso growth, zzso zzso and imaging of zzso in zzso mice with radioactive zzso 

The existence of zzso was confirmed in normal human zzso zzso binds both zzso receptors with similar affinity as other zzso zzso but zzso zzso cell migration and is zzso to zzso cells through zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso retinal zzso by reducing both zzso and zzso zzso reduced the growth of zzso human colon zzso in association with reduced zzso density, and an intravenous zzso of zzso is taken up into colon zzso zzso 

Here we identify a second member of the family, zzso with similar properties to those of zzso and underline the importance of the six zzso acids of zzso zzso in the zzso activity of the zzso zzso
