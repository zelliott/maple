zzso zzso zzso is strongly associated with a wide spectrum of adverse health zzso We propose a zzso and the zzso zzso zzso framework to accurately estimate the reference zzso intake zzso for zzso consumption and zzso water zzso concentration based on zzso of zzso and zzso zzso data from the zzso area in zzso Our results show a positive relationship between zzso exposure and zzso and zzso cumulative zzso ratio using zzso zzso zzso Based on male zzso cancer with an excess lifetime cancer risk of zzso we estimate the reference zzso zzso zzso zzso value to be zzso zzso zzso dry zzso based on the suggested daily consumption rate of 120 zzso Our findings show that consumption of zzso in a zzso disease zzso area poses no significant cancer risk zzso cancer risks ranging from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso that people in zzso areas are not readily associated with higher fatalities for zzso cancer exposed from zzso zzso We are confident that our model can be easily adapted for other aquaculture species, and encourage risk managers to use the model to evaluate the potential zzso long-term zzso cancer zzso We conclude that, by zzso the zzso concept and zzso investigation of humans exposed to zzso we can provide a scientific basis for risk analysis to enhance risk management zzso
