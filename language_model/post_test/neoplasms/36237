Surgery is a crucial intervention in most cancer patients, but the zzso period is characterized by increased risks for future outbreak of zzso zzso and the initiation of new zzso major cause of zzso zzso Here we argue that the short zzso period is disproportionately critical in determining long-term recurrence rates, discuss the various underlying risk factors that act zzso during this period, and assert that this time frame presents an unexplored opportunity to reduce long-term cancer zzso We then address zzso mechanisms that zzso these risk factors, focusing on excess zzso release of catecholamines and zzso which were recently shown to be prominent in zzso cancer recurrence through their direct impact on the zzso tissue and its zzso and through suppressing zzso zzso The involvement of the immune system is further discussed in light of accumulating evidence in cancer patients, and given the recent identification of zzso activated unique zzso populations which, if not zzso can destroy zzso zzso tumor zzso We then review animal studies and human zzso findings, suggesting the efficacy of blocking catecholamines and/or zzso zzso limiting zzso and increasing survival zzso Finally, we propose a specific zzso zzso intervention in cancer patients, based on simultaneous zzso blockade and zzso zzso and discuss specific considerations for its application in clinical trials, including our approved zzso In sum, we zzso present the rationale for a new approach to reduce long-term cancer recurrence by using a relatively safe, brief, and inexpensive intervention during the zzso zzso
