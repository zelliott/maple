zzso in the zzso genes occur in zzso of all human zzso These zzso in turn, produce zzso proteins that are unique to cancer cells, rendering them distinguishable from normal cells by the immune zzso Thus, zzso Ras proteins may form potential targets for immune zzso We conducted a phase zzso clinical trial in patients with advanced zzso to test the toxicity and the ability to induce an immune response by vaccination with zzso zzso Ras peptides reflecting zzso 12 zzso These peptides corresponded to each of the patient's own tumor Ras zzso Patients were vaccinated monthly zzso zzso with the specific Ras zzso along with zzso zzso zzso zzso Research, zzso Hamilton, zzso zzso at one of five different zzso dose levels zzso 500, 1,000, zzso and 5,000 zzso Three out of 10 zzso patients generated a zzso Ras specific zzso and/or zzso zzso immune zzso The zzso zzso cells specific for zzso to Val zzso at zzso 12 were capable of zzso an zzso tumor cell line carrying the corresponding zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso The treatment has been well tolerated with no evidence of serious acute or delayed systemic side effects on any of the five dose zzso We demonstrated that we can generate in cancer patients specific zzso responses that detect single zzso acid differences in Ras zzso Neither the immune responses nor the minor side effects seen were found to be dose zzso This approach may provide a unique opportunity for generating a zzso zzso Also, in zzso stimulation of these cells with the corresponding zzso generated specific zzso lines that could be used for adoptive immune zzso
