Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle in the successful zzso of tumors in many cancer zzso Resistance is either intrinsic or acquired, involving mechanisms such as genetic zzso decreased influx and increased zzso of zzso Strategies for the reversal of resistance involve the zzso of zzso responsible for drug resistance, the zzso of proteins regulating zzso mechanisms and improving the zzso of drugs using zzso Novel strides in the reversal of drug resistance are emerging, involving the use of zzso targeting stem cells, zzso 

This paper reviews the most recent cancer drug reversal strategies involving zzso for targeting cancer cells and cancer stem cells zzso for enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso used in conjunction with existing therapies, such as gene therapy and zzso zzso has been shown to improve the reversal of drug zzso the mechanisms involved in this include specific targeting of drugs and zzso zzso enhanced cellular zzso of drugs and improved zzso of drugs with poor zzso zzso Important strategies in the reversal of drug resistance include: a zzso zzso system housing a targeting zzso zzso to kill resistant cancer cells and zzso zzso drugs and a tumor zzso zzso element, to release the zzso zzso
