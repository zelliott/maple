Since the identification of tumor associated zzso zzso in different tumor zzso many vaccination strategies have been investigated, including zzso zzso zzso from the first decade of clinical zzso though demonstrating the feasibility and the good toxicity profile of this approach, provided evidence of clinical activity only in a minority of patients, despite inducing zzso in up to 50% of zzso In this review, we discuss the different approaches recently developed in order to induce stronger zzso zzso tumor growth control, possibly translating into improved clinical response rates, with specific focus on zzso zzso zzso This strategy offers many advantages, such as the possibility of bypassing tumor zzso and selection of zzso zzso clones escaping zzso immune responses, or combining zzso class zzso and class zzso zzso thus zzso both zzso and zzso immune zzso zzso advances in zzso discovery technologies permit further zzso of zzso selection, in terms of identification of zzso and unique zzso as well as zzso derived from different tumor zzso cell zzso With the ultimate goal of combining zzso selection with zzso zzso profile, zzso based zzso vaccines remain a promising treatment for cancer patients, as zzso by of zzso and clinical zzso
