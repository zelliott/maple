The use of zzso drugs for cancer treatment was welcomed because of the hypothesis that they would be much less likely to lose their therapeutic activity as a result of zzso resistance over zzso Unfortunately, the clinical experience has shown that acquired resistance to zzso therapeutic strategies is possible since many patients whose tumors initially respond to drugs such as zzso (a zzso zzso against zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso receptors and zzso zzso or zzso chemotherapy zzso low dose zzso become zzso often within months of therapy zzso Indeed, the role of associated zzso chemotherapy in zzso resistance seems to be ignored by the previous studies and the real part played by these drugs has to be written zzso The studies undertaken on zzso resistance mainly involved mechanisms directly related to the zzso drugs alone and as such lead one to ask whether the acquired resistance to zzso zzso might also be zzso by the zzso drugs usually associated (at least into the zzso with these types of zzso The proposed hypothesis is concerning the possibility that the acquired resistance to zzso therapy could be actively and heavily modulated by the choice of the associated zzso zzso The zzso compounds may delay or accelerate the process through the zzso zzso or zzso of zzso or zzso factors or their receptors in the zzso zzso and other type of cells of the tumor zzso In conclusion, the consequences of our hypothesis could be promptly translated into the zzso studies and verified in clinical trials, involving cancer patients resistant to chemotherapy plus zzso drug zzso
