We used new methods to examine differences in zzso cancer survival between six zzso in Japan, after adjustment for age and stage at zzso We applied zzso models for relative survival to data from zzso cancer zzso covering each zzso for patients diagnosed with stomach, zzso or breast cancer during zzso zzso plots were used to display the excess hazard ratio zzso for each zzso defined as the excess hazard of death from each cancer within 5 years of diagnosis relative to the mean excess hazard (in excess of national background mortality by age and zzso in all six zzso zzso The contribution of age and stage to the zzso in each zzso was assessed from differences in zzso zzso between the various zzso No significant differences were seen between zzso in zzso survival from breast zzso For zzso of the stomach and zzso zzso in zzso zzso were above the upper zzso control zzso For stomach cancer, the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were zzso for men and zzso for women, compared with zzso and zzso zzso in the stage at diagnosis of stomach cancer appeared to explain most of this excess hazard zzso for men, zzso for zzso whereas differences in age at diagnosis explained very little zzso zzso This approach offers the potential to zzso the impact of differences in stage at diagnosis on time trends and regional differences in cancer zzso It zzso the utility of zzso cancer zzso for improving cancer zzso
