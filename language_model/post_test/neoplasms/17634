Red blood cell and serum zzso zzso were investigated to determine normal zzso for our geographic area and if potential differences existed in patients with selected diagnoses zzso zzso zzso and chronic zzso zzso was zzso in samples of red blood cells, serum and urine by zzso zzso zzso The results were analyzed by comparing 1) pooled data from all ages for each disease with normal values, and 2) normal values with zzso patients in each disease zzso zzso in red blood cell zzso zzso zzso less than zzso occurred in normal subjects over 60 years of age without concurrent significant decreases in serum zzso Although differential results were noted in zzso groups, overall results showed that decreased zzso of zzso in both red cells and in serum occurred with alcoholic zzso zzso and chronic zzso failure zzso less than zzso Red blood cell zzso zzso also were decreased in patients with stable chronic zzso zzso serum zzso zzso were positively correlated with zzso zzso in patients with zzso There was no correlation between serum zzso and zzso zzso in patients with liver disease or between serum zzso and zzso zzso in patients with chronic zzso failure whose urinary zzso of zzso was far below control zzso
