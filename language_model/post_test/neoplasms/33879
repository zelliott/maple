zzso involving chronic diseases that share zzso factors or zzso mechanisms appear to have a weaker negative influence on decline in physical functioning than zzso zzso indicate that combinations of diseases that both influence physical zzso but through different mechanisms zzso symptoms zzso decreased endurance zzso may be more zzso than other zzso
