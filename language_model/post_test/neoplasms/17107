zzso zzso a zzso at high exposure levels, is a major global health zzso Prospective studies on zzso effects at zzso zzso levels are zzso 

We evaluated the association between baseline zzso exposure and cancer mortality in zzso American Indians, 45 to 74 years of age, from Arizona, Oklahoma, and zzso Dakota who participated in the Strong Heart Study from 1989 to 1991 and were followed through zzso We estimated zzso zzso exposure as the sum of zzso and zzso species in zzso Cancer deaths zzso overall, 78 zzso 34 liver, 18 zzso 26 zzso 24 zzso 25 zzso 32 zzso 26 breast, and 40 zzso were assessed by mortality surveillance zzso We hypothesized an association with zzso liver, zzso and kidney zzso 

Median zzso zzso urine concentration for zzso plus zzso zzso species was zzso zzso zzso zzso The adjusted zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso comparing the 80th versus 20th zzso of zzso were zzso zzso for overall cancer, zzso zzso for lung cancer, zzso zzso zzso for liver cancer, zzso zzso for prostate cancer, and zzso zzso zzso for kidney zzso The corresponding hazard ratios were zzso zzso for pancreatic cancer, and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not associated with zzso of the esophagus and stomach, colon and zzso and zzso 

Low to moderate exposure to zzso zzso was zzso associated with increased mortality for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso 

These findings support the role of zzso zzso exposure in development of zzso zzso and zzso cancer and can inform zzso risk zzso
