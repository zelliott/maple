To perform a risk analysis of the cancer chemotherapy process, by comparing five different zzso To zzso demonstrate the usefulness of zzso and information technologies, to identify residual risks that may be the target of additional zzso 

A zzso of the process started in 1999 and was planned to be finished in zzso The analysis was performed after the zzso and at the beginning of information technologies zzso 

Two thousand two hundred beds university hospital, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Twelve thousand cancer zzso each zzso 

According to the failure zzso effects and zzso analysis zzso method, the failure modes were defined and their zzso indexes were calculated on the basis of the likelihood of zzso the potential severity for the patients, and the detection zzso zzso indexes were compared and the zzso of residual risks was zzso 

The sum of zzso indexes of 27 identified failure modes was zzso for the decentralized phase, zzso for zzso zzso for electronic prescription, zzso for electronic production control, and zzso for bedside scanning zzso global zzso The greatest improvements concerned the risk of errors in the production protocols (by a factor of zzso followed by zzso problems during transmission zzso and zzso errors during the production zzso Among the six zzso indexes remaining superior to 100 in the final process, two were judged to be acceptable, whereas further improvements were planned for the four zzso 

zzso to the pharmacy was associated with a strong improvement but additional developments involving information technologies also contributed to a major risk zzso A zzso analysis confirmed the zzso of all developments, as the cost per gained zzso point remained stable all over the different zzso
