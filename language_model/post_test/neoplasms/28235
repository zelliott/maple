To provide evidence of a substantial decline in cancer rates for the period 1991 through 1995 and characterize major risk factors that seem to be driving secular trends in cancer mortality and zzso 

zzso and mortality rates were calculated using national surveillance data collected through the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso program and the National Center for Health zzso 

zzso cancer zzso and mortality fell in the period 1991 through 1995; this decline is largely attributable to decreases in the zzso zzso especially lung zzso Of the 20 leading incident zzso today, both zzso and mortality are decreasing among 11 sites for men and 12 for zzso In men, the decline in mortality has been notable and is especially apparent for the zzso zzso including those of the zzso oral cavity and zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso In women, zzso mortality decreased only approximately zzso from 1991 through zzso Three zzso continued to show substantial increases in mortality through 1995 for both men and women zzso multiple zzso and zzso zzso while zzso rates continued to climb for liver cancer, zzso lymphoma, and zzso 

Data from the zzso program on recent trends in cancer zzso and mortality show that cancer rates are generally on the decline, largely because of reductions in zzso zzso A consistent increase in mortality rates due to liver cancer poses a new health care challenge, one that will require the development of an effective treatment for individuals currently infected with zzso C or B to prevent mortality rates from continuing to zzso
