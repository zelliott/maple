We have a limited understanding of the zzso determined physical activity levels of cancer survivors at the population zzso Further, we have even less of an understanding of this behavior by weight status zzso normal weight, overweight, and zzso zzso the purpose of this study was to describe zzso physical activity levels among US cancer survivors and to do so across weight zzso 

Data from the zzso zzso was zzso One hundred zzso adult cancer survivors wore an zzso for zzso with weight status determined from measured body mass zzso 

zzso zzso of cancer survivors were sufficiently active zzso met current physical activity zzso zzso were not significant for zzso physical zzso however, results showed that obese cancer survivors engaged in zzso less zzso than normal weight cancer survivors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Most adult cancer survivors are insufficiently active and obese cancer survivors engage in less zzso than their zzso 

Health care professionals are encouraged to increase cancer zzso awareness of the minimum levels of zzso needed for optimal health, particularly among obese cancer zzso Additionally, cancer survivors should also be informed of the positive health outcomes associated with zzso physical zzso
