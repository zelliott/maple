The application of flow zzso to cancer diagnosis and the prediction of tumor behavior continues to zzso The ability of flow zzso to examine multiple parameters of large numbers of individual cells is being exploited increasingly to characterize zzso processes zzso This will allow closer examination of tumor zzso and identification of zzso with different behavioral zzso zzso zzso is being used with greater frequency in attempts to predict tumor behavior and response to zzso zzso zzso may have the most to offer in this zzso Diagnosis of cancer by routine zzso examination will not be replaced by flow zzso flow zzso will be used in conjunction with zzso zzso The detection of proliferation zzso and zzso products, as well as cell zzso provides information on zzso progression that is not readily zzso by other zzso In addition, flow zzso will undoubtedly be used to measure other features of zzso cells, such as zzso levels and zzso zzso which may better characterize the behavior of the zzso Advances in flow zzso zzso light sources, zzso development, and basic aspects of cellular and molecular biology will continue to permit this technology to define zzso cells and their behavior better, resulting in both improved patient care and a better understanding of tumor zzso
