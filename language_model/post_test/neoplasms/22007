zzso proteins belong to the Ras zzso of small zzso and function as zzso switches that shuttle between active and inactive states based on the nature of bound zzso zzso Three sets of regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factors, and zzso zzso proteins zzso control the balance between active and inactive zzso zzso There are more than 70 zzso zzso in the human zzso The zzso family is distinguished by the presence of the zzso zzso However, the majority of zzso contain multiple additional zzso There are as many as eight zzso in some of these zzso The modular structure of zzso is important for their interaction with other zzso A significant number of zzso have been shown to be present in altered abundance in a variety of human zzso or cell zzso The ability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways may lend themselves as targets for small zzso therapeutic agents against zzso
