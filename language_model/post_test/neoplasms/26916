zzso zzso transfer for cancer and chronic infection is an emerging field that shows promise in recent zzso zzso engineering of T zzso to express zzso zzso receptors can overcome immune zzso which has been a major limitation of zzso zzso Advances in cell engineering and culture approaches to enable efficient gene transfer and zzso cell expansion have facilitated broader evaluation of this technology, moving adoptive transfer from a zzso application to the cusp of a mainstream zzso The major challenge currently facing the field is to increase the specificity of engineered zzso for tumors, because targeting shared zzso has the potential to lead to zzso zzso zzso as observed in recent zzso As the field of adoptive transfer technology zzso the major engineering challenge is the development of automated cell culture systems, so that the approach can extend beyond specialized academic centers and become widely zzso
