Here we describe the isolation of zzso in a screen for zzso zzso zzso is a gene that is zzso in many zzso tumor cells and the expression of which can zzso the process of zzso formation in a variety of zzso In zzso we observed cell death induction by zzso in many different cell zzso zzso seems to promote cell death by the generation of zzso oxygen zzso zzso These zzso however, are not derived from the zzso respiratory chain as in most other scenarios leading to zzso We observed that zzso renders cells sensitive to zzso by causing the specific release of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso Moreover, zzso activates the zzso zzso which mediates zzso release and zzso induction and allows to detect the formation of zzso
