zzso zzso such as zzso have been proved to be very important zzso zzso In order to discover more potent zzso agents and explore the preliminary structure activity relationship, a new series of zzso zzso zzso were zzso via a zzso strategy, and their zzso activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso The results indicated that compounds 2, 8, and 9 with the substitute zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, exhibited quite strong zzso zzso The underlying mechanism tests demonstrated that these compounds could induce zzso detected by zzso zzso and zzso V and zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis indicated that the cancer cells were predominantly arrested at the zzso phase when exposure to these compounds was examined by flow zzso These compounds may serve as lead candidates in the development of novel zzso for cancer zzso
