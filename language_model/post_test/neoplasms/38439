zzso is a complex, zzso zzso process often described as zzso zzso Conventional models of cancer progression are typically based on the genetic and zzso changes observed in zzso and zzso zzso We have explored an alternative approach that emphasizes the selection forces within zzso landscapes governing growth and evolution in in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In each environment, specific barriers to proliferation act as strong selection forces that determine the optimal zzso properties that permit tumor growth and zzso Thus, the zzso properties or zzso of cancer can be viewed as successful adaptations to these zzso selection zzso In turn, these selection pressures are not zzso but will zzso change as a result of tumor population growth and zzso Here, we emphasize the role of zzso and zzso in the progression of tumor from in zzso to invasive zzso This is a consequence of early tumor cell proliferation on zzso surfaces, which are separated from the underlying blood supply by the intact basement zzso As tumor cells zzso further away from the basement zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso flow to and from the blood vessels result in regional zzso and zzso Cellular adaptation to the former include zzso of zzso and to the latter include zzso of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso proteins such as zzso zzso We propose this zzso is critical for subsequent zzso growth of primary and zzso zzso
