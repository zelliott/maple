zzso cellular zzso involving transfer of zzso T cells has shown some notable zzso responses in a minority of cancer zzso In particular, transfer of zzso zzso has resulted in long-term objective responses in patients with advanced zzso However, the inability to isolate sufficient numbers of zzso T cells from most zzso has restricted the broad utility of this zzso An emerging approach to circumvent this limitation involves the genetic modification of zzso cells with T cell zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso variable zzso zzso receptors that can specifically redirect T cells to zzso There has been much progress in the design of zzso and zzso receptors to enhance the zzso zzso of zzso cells and their trafficking and persistence in zzso zzso effort has been directed toward improving the safety of this approach and reducing the zzso of the zzso This review discusses the latest developments in the field of adoptive zzso using genetically modified immune cells that have been zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso and used in zzso and clinical settings as zzso zzso
