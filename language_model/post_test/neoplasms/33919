Our results show that cells derived from the inner cell mass zzso show a clear tendency to differentiate into the neural zzso showing both cells and structures in different degrees of zzso Among the experimental zzso used to learn about neural zzso there have been several lines of investigation on stem cells, including embryonic stem zzso cells isolated from the inner cell mass of zzso and also stem cells derived from embryonic zzso zzso In this work, we have used a cellular line obtained from the inner cell mass of a zzso The cells were cultured and after zzso zzso in zzso zzso The neural differentiation was zzso and could be observed both by zzso and zzso zzso It was represented by zzso zzso and zzso cells, as expressed by the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso positive zzso was found in zzso cells, which suggest the zzso zzso These results show that isolation of cells from the inner mass of zzso represents an easy, zzso and cheap source of neural zzso suitable for both in zzso and in zzso differentiation zzso
