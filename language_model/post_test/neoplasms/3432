The association of depression and increased mortality in the general population, and also various medical conditions, is well zzso However, depression is not well studied in the setting of zzso stem-cell transplantation zzso We examined the association between depressive syndrome and survival after zzso 

A total of 193 patients who received zzso or zzso zzso from Brigham and Women's Hospital or zzso Cancer Institute were evaluated zzso The zzso zzso symptom zzso the zzso and the Spitzer Quality of Life Index zzso were zzso Outcomes evaluated included survival and quality of zzso 

zzso patients zzso satisfied the criteria for depressive zzso The zzso probability of survival for the depressed and zzso patients was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso respectively zzso zzso In multivariable zzso depressed patients have a zzso greater risk of dying than zzso patients zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso between 6 and 12 months after zzso after adjusting for other zzso zzso Global zzso in quality of life was observed in the depressed cohort when last measured at 24 months after zzso 

zzso syndrome after zzso is associated with decreased survival, at least from 6 to 12 months after zzso zzso of this association after controlling for possible zzso factors suggests that depression may be more than simply a marker for concurrent ill zzso This study raises an interesting hypothesis as to whether psychological or zzso intervention for depression after zzso can improve survival and/or quality of zzso
