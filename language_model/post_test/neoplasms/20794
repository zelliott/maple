There is long-standing recognition that transformed and tumor cells exhibit striking zzso in nuclear zzso as well as in the representation and zzso distribution of zzso acids and regulatory zzso zzso of nuclear structure support cell growth and zzso properties of cells by zzso the organization of zzso replication and zzso sites, zzso zzso complexes, zzso and regulatory factors in structurally and functionally zzso zzso zzso within the three-dimensional context of nuclear zzso The emerging evidence for functional zzso of nuclear structure and gene expression is consistent with linkage of zzso modifications in nuclear organization to compromised gene regulation during the onset and progression of zzso
