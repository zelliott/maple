Similar changes in zzso organization take place during development and zzso The size of zzso loop zzso fixed on the nuclear skeleton zzso increased from 20 to approximately 200 zzso These changes are accompanied by an increased size of zzso and altered specificity of loop attachment to the nuclear zzso During zzso inverse changes in the zzso structure are observed, zzso cells are zzso and return to the initial zzso In this review, we consider new experimental data on organization of the zzso zzso and nuclear zzso in zzso and zzso
