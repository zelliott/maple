zzso evidence suggests a relation between patient zzso and zzso zzso However, this research has often failed to adequately control for other possible contributing zzso In the current study, the contribution of patient zzso to the occurrence and severity of zzso zzso was examined using more stringent statistical techniques zzso zzso zzso than other similar studies that have relied on zzso zzso zzso tests, and zzso regression, and further extended upon previous research by including quality of life zzso in the zzso 

In all, zzso first-time chemotherapy patients taking part in a trial comparing zzso regimens answered questions regarding their zzso for experiencing zzso Patients then completed a diary assessing both the occurrence and severity of their zzso in the 4 days after their first zzso 

zzso zzso for zzso corresponded with greater average and peak zzso after chemotherapy and this was after controlling for age, sex, zzso to motion zzso diagnosis, and zzso Interestingly, patients classified as highly expectant zzso zzso experienced significantly greater average and peak zzso than those classified as somewhat zzso slightly zzso and not expectant zzso third, and fourth zzso respectively), whereas there were no significant differences between these lower levels of zzso Furthermore, increases in average zzso led to a significant reduction in zzso after zzso 

Patient zzso appear to contribute to zzso zzso and patients that are highly expectant of experiencing zzso appear to be at particular zzso zzso that target these patients should reduce the burden of zzso and may also improve zzso
