Based on zzso findings and on the clinical zzso efficacy of sequential zzso and zzso the authors sought to define the maximum tolerated doses zzso and zzso zzso zzso associated with a sequential combination of zzso zzso and zzso in patients with solid zzso 

The zzso were determined through standard dose escalation in zzso of three zzso Patients with zzso solid tumors and performance status zzso or zzso 2 were treated with intravenous zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and oral zzso 160 zzso zzso zzso during every zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was administered on Day 8 in subsequent zzso Blood samples were obtained before treatment during zzso 1 zzso 1, 2, and 5) for zzso I zzso 

zzso patients received a combined total of 129 zzso The zzso were zzso 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 160 zzso without zzso In minimally zzso patients, zzso allowed zzso dose escalation to 110 zzso Three patients zzso had zzso partial responses, and 4 patients zzso had stable zzso Day 2 zzso I levels increased by zzso times relative to baseline levels in 7 of 14 patients analyzed zzso 

The novel sequential combination that was evaluated generally was well tolerated and active in patients with zzso solid zzso Based on zzso zzso the authors recommend further evaluation of zzso 110 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 160 zzso with zzso support in minimally zzso zzso
