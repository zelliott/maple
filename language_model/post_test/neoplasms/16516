The zzso zzso zzso Workshop was established to characterize the molecular zzso structure and zzso of a panel of zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso directed against human zzso zzso zzso and its zzso and to consider how this information could be used to improve zzso of zzso results for these zzso In this zzso study, 27 zzso have been characterized in detail as to their main and fine zzso by direct zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso used in the study included the upcoming first WHO reference zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthetic peptides of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hormones, zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso from various zzso zzso zzso of blinded internal controls demonstrated the reliability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso assignment was possible in many instances by comparing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a large panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso previously well characterized in the zzso zzso and Paris zzso zzso All three major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) were represented in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could further be subdivided into zzso those recognizing zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso 1; zzso zzso zzso 2; zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso those recognizing zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10; zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Members of the latter group were specific either for zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) or zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso 6; zzso zzso zzso 1) or in addition to zzso + zzso + zzso recognized zzso to a minor zzso zzso zzso 3; zzso zzso zzso 3) or similar degree zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso located on the first and third zzso protruding from the zzso knot of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso presumably centered around the knot itself zzso or zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso panel of zzso represents all major zzso zzso suitable for the design of specific sandwich zzso High zzso zzso in serum and urine during the course of pregnancy and tumor development favors certain zzso zzso For routine diagnostic purposes, zzso recognizing a broad spectrum of zzso zzso such as zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso + zzso may be zzso Low zzso against related zzso hormones zzso zzso and their derivatives is zzso These criteria are best met by combinations of zzso directed against zzso located around the zzso knot zzso and against those encompassing the top of zzso 1 and 3 on zzso zzso zzso The first WHO reference zzso for zzso of zzso and zzso molecules being prepared by the zzso should facilitate characterization of what zzso for zzso are zzso The next step towards improving zzso zzso of zzso of zzso derivatives in pregnancy and zzso is provided by results of this zzso zzso
