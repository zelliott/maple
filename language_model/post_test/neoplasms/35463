Using zzso nationwide zzso data for Taiwan, this study compared zzso surgical mortality rates with hospital volume for five zzso gastrointestinal zzso 

The study sample was drawn from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research zzso A total of zzso patients, each of whom had undergone a zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso or liver zzso between 2000 and 2003, were selected as the study zzso The outcome measure was zzso zzso The study sample was zzso into five patient groups for each zzso and zzso zzso analyses were performed for each procedure after adjustment for hospital and patient characteristics to assess the independent association between hospital volume and zzso zzso 

The adjusted odds ratios showed a steady decline in mortality rates for zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso with increasing hospital zzso The adjusted mortality odds for these four procedures in zzso hospitals, relative to zzso hospitals, ranged from zzso to zzso As regards pancreatic zzso after adjustment for patient, clinical, and hospital factors, no statistically significant association was discernible between hospital volume and the likelihood of zzso 

After adjustment for hospital and physician zzso in four of the five procedures, patients treated at zzso hospitals had lower zzso mortality rates than those treated at zzso zzso Our findings zzso for the most part, the hypothesis that better outcomes are associated with zzso zzso
