Several lines of evidence suggest that tumor growth, zzso and zzso are dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the lack of zzso specific for the type IV zzso family of zzso has thus far prevented the selective targeting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for therapeutic intervention in zzso Here, we describe the isolation of specific zzso zzso from zzso display zzso zzso We show that zzso peptides containing the sequence zzso are potent and selective zzso of zzso and zzso but not of several other zzso family zzso Our zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso the migration of human zzso cells and tumor zzso Moreover, it prevents tumor growth and invasion in animal models and improves survival of mice bearing human zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso specifically target zzso blood vessels in zzso Selective zzso zzso may prove useful in tumor targeting and zzso zzso
