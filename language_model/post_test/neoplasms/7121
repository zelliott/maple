In addition to being produced in ethanol zzso zzso occurs naturally in alcoholic zzso Limited zzso evidence points to zzso as an independent risk factor for cancer during alcohol consumption, in addition to the effects of zzso This study aims to estimate human exposure to zzso from alcoholic beverages and provide a quantitative risk zzso 

The human dietary intake of zzso via alcoholic beverages was estimated based on World Health Organization zzso consumption data and literature on the zzso contents of different zzso groups zzso wine, spirits and unrecorded zzso The risk assessment was conducted using the European Food Safety Authority's margin of exposure zzso approach with benchmark doses obtained from zzso zzso of animal zzso zzso cancer risk was calculated using the zzso dose zzso 

The average exposure to zzso from alcoholic beverages was estimated at zzso zzso body zzso The zzso was calculated to be zzso and the zzso cancer risk at zzso in zzso Higher risk may exist for people exposed to high zzso zzso as we have found in certain unrecorded alcohol beverages in Guatemala and Russia, for which we have demonstrated possible exposure scenarios, with risks in the range of 1 in zzso 

The zzso cancer risks for zzso from alcoholic beverages greatly exceed the usual limits for cancer risks from the environment set between 1 : 10,000 and 1 : zzso Alcohol consumption has thus been identified as a direct source of zzso exposure, which in conjunction with other sources zzso zzso zzso results in a magnitude of risk requiring zzso An initial public health measure could be to reduce the zzso content in alcoholic beverages as low as technologically possible, and to restrict its use as a food zzso zzso
