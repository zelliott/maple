The evaluation included diagnosis, risk factors, complications leading to zzso admission, zzso therapy, and zzso zzso analysis included evaluation of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso System zzso zzso 

Respiratory zzso was the leading diagnosis for zzso admission, whereas in the remaining children cardiovascular zzso zzso failure, zzso zzso zzso and zzso complications led to zzso zzso The number of organ failures was correlated to zzso All children but one of group A could be discharged from the zzso whereas 12 of 35 children in group B died, despite intensive care treatment zzso The zzso and zzso scores at admission to the zzso were significantly higher in children who did not survive the period of intensive care treatment in group zzso However, all patients with a zzso score of zzso zzso
