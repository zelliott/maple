To determine the zzso dose zzso of zzso acid zzso administered on an intermittent oral schedule with zzso zzso in children with zzso cancer, and whether the marked reduction in plasma zzso zzso observed with chronic daily oral dosing could be zzso with an intermittent dosing zzso 

zzso children with zzso cancer zzso by age, zzso or zzso 12 and zzso 12 zzso were treated with zzso 3 consecutive days per week and zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 5 consecutive days per week, both repeated zzso The starting dose of zzso was 60 zzso divided into three doses, with planned zzso to 90 and 120 zzso Because severe headaches have been noted to occur on the initial day of zzso administration, only two of three doses of zzso were administered on day 1 of each zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso headache was observed in two of five patients older than 12 years treated at the zzso dose level and in one of six zzso or zzso 12 years at the zzso zzso Other zzso zzso of zzso included zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso dry skin, zzso and zzso One child with zzso zzso had an objective response of 6 months' zzso and one with zzso zzso tumor had zzso maturation of multiple zzso This intermittent schedule allowed for exposure to relatively high plasma zzso of zzso on a repetitive zzso Following zzso doses, the zzso area under the zzso curve zzso decreased from 96 zzso 14 zzso on day 1 to 26 zzso 24 zzso by day 3 of drug administration, but on day 1 of the fourth consecutive week of therapy, the zzso averaged 110 zzso 16 zzso The recommended pediatric phase II dose of zzso administered on this schedule is 90 zzso 

An intermittent schedule of zzso administration appears to circumvent the low plasma drug exposure that is a result of the sustained zzso of metabolism when this drug is administered on a chronic daily zzso Based on the results of this trial, a phase II trial of zzso in zzso and zzso tumor using this schedule is in zzso
