zzso control probability zzso to zzso is determined by complex interactions between tumor biology, tumor zzso radiation zzso and zzso zzso The complexity of these zzso variable interactions constitutes a challenge for building zzso models for routine clinical zzso We describe a zzso framework that can unravel the higher order relationships among zzso zzso zzso zzso interrogate various zzso zzso and zzso to unseen data before when applied zzso 

Several zzso approaches are discussed that include zzso zzso equivalent uniform dose, zzso zzso model, and model building methods using statistical zzso and machine learning zzso Institutional zzso of zzso cell lung cancer zzso patients are used to demonstrate these zzso The performance of the different methods was evaluated using zzso zzso rank correlations zzso zzso was controlled via zzso zzso 

Using a zzso of 56 patients with primary zzso tumors and 23 candidate zzso we estimated zzso volume and zzso to be the best model parameters for predicting zzso using statistical zzso and a zzso zzso Using these zzso the support zzso machine zzso kernel method provided superior performance for zzso prediction with an zzso on zzso testing compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell kill equivalent uniform dose model zzso 

The prediction of treatment response can be improved by utilizing zzso approaches, which are able to unravel important zzso complex interactions among model variables and have the capacity to predict on unseen data for prospective clinical zzso
