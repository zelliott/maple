Genome amplification is often observed in human zzso The zzso zzso cycle is the mechanism that often zzso duplicated zzso Some research has indicated common fragile sites zzso as possible sites of zzso zzso at the origin of zzso zzso Here we searched two human zzso regions known as amplification hot spots for any DNA copy number zzso by analyzing 21 cancer cell lines to investigate the relationship between zzso fragility and zzso We identified a duplicated region on a zzso zzso present in the zzso of two zzso leukemia cell lines zzso The two duplicated regions are organized into large zzso which suggests that one zzso cycle has zzso Our findings show that the three zzso are localized in the sequence of three zzso zzso zzso which here has been characterized zzso zzso zzso a newly localized zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
