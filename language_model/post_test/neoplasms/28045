zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso assembly and also zzso zzso zzso In zzso evaluations, zzso demonstrated broad zzso activity in zzso and in zzso including both zzso and zzso human lung zzso zzso exposure schedules in zzso models demonstrated optimal efficacy indicating zzso zzso zzso The early phase I and II evaluations a five-minute zzso infusion schedule was zzso however, only modest zzso activity was noted, possibly due to rapid systemic zzso To overcome these limitations and to exploit the potential for zzso behavior of zzso the feasibility of administering zzso as a 72-hour continuous intravenous zzso infusion was zzso 

Patients with advanced solid zzso were entered into this phase I study, in which both the infusion duration and dose of zzso were zzso The starting dose was zzso zzso over 12 hours administered every 3 zzso In each successive dose level, the dose and infusion duration were zzso increased in a zzso zzso Once a 72-hour zzso infusion duration was reached, zzso zzso alone continued until a maximum tolerated dose zzso was zzso 

zzso patients were entered into the zzso zzso was administered at doses ranging from zzso zzso zzso over 12 hours to zzso zzso zzso over 72 hours every 3 zzso The principal zzso zzso zzso were severe zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso was unacceptably high at zzso doses above zzso zzso which was determined to be the zzso and dose recommended for phase II zzso At these dose levels, zzso could not be detected in the plasma by a previously validated and sensitive zzso liquid zzso zzso with a lower limit of detection of 1 zzso No zzso responses were zzso 

zzso can be safely administered using a 72-hour zzso infusion zzso The toxicity profile is similar to that observed previously using brief infusion zzso Using this protracted zzso infusion schedule the maximum tolerated dose is zzso zzso zzso
