zzso zzso zzso zzso have a restricted target cell zzso They transform only a small part of the cell types in which they are zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have shown that some of them may act by blocking specific steps of zzso If the cell can bypass the block, zzso by a temporary switch off of the zzso transforming zzso zzso of the zzso product at the zzso temperature may be unable to restore the transformed zzso Consideration of these facts, together with evidence concerning the zzso of the transformed zzso and the suppression of zzso in hybrids derived from the fusion of normal and zzso cells, leads to the concept of zzso zzso It states that the transforming and/or zzso effect of a given zzso activated by structural or by regulatory changes, is restricted to specific and often quite narrow differentiation or maturation windows within each susceptible zzso A similar restriction seems to apply to zzso activated by zzso zzso The regular juxtaposition of the zzso gene to one of the three zzso zzso in zzso lymphoma, mouse zzso and rat zzso is a case in zzso The zzso zzso can break at many different places, zzso upstream, or downstream of the zzso but not within its coding zzso This suggests that the break occurs at random and the zzso protein plays an essential role in the selective, zzso zzso zzso If so, other zzso should be equally zzso to the zzso hot zzso during the long series of cell divisions in the zzso target cell population that characterizes the zzso of both zzso and zzso In other human zzso zzso and zzso other zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been found, confirming that this can actually occur, but only in zzso different zzso The exclusive involvement of zzso in zzso and zzso must be zzso to the specific functional features of the precursor cells and to the normal role of the zzso zzso Recent evidence indicates that the zzso gene is regularly turned off before or at the time when the cell enters a zzso that is programmed to lead it towards a resting Go zzso zzso expanded zzso are believed to turn into resting memory cells upon waning of the zzso zzso The normal, zzso zzso zzso is regularly switched off in both zzso and zzso indicating that the cell has already zzso a program involving the zzso of zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
