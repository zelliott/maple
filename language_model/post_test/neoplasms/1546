zzso zzso zzso is a zzso platinum compound with activity against a wide range of human zzso cell lines and zzso including zzso and zzso zzso To assess its potential combined with a zzso a phase I study of zzso and zzso in advanced cancer was initiated by the National Cancer Institute of zzso Trials zzso 

Patients with advanced cancer, measurable disease, performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group zzso no major organ dysfunction, and one or no previous zzso regimen received escalating doses of zzso and zzso every 3 weeks, with a starting dose of zzso 80 zzso and zzso 60 zzso 

zzso patients enrolled on four dose levels were zzso for toxicity and 25 patients were zzso for zzso The maximum tolerated dose was dose level 4 zzso 120 zzso and zzso 75 zzso with grade 4 zzso in both minimally and heavily zzso patients causing zzso zzso As well at dose level 4, one patient had grade 3 vomiting despite zzso zzso level three was expanded for both groups of patients and was defined as the recommended phase II dose at zzso 100 zzso and zzso 75 zzso zzso zzso included fatigue, zzso and other mild zzso There was one partial response in a patient with prostate cancer and stable disease in 15 zzso No apparent zzso interaction was zzso 

zzso and zzso can be combined with a recommended phase II dose level of 100 zzso and 75 zzso respectively, given zzso every 3 zzso The combination has activity and should be explored in responsive zzso zzso
