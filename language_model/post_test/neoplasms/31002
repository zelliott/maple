The current approach to health risk assessment of toxic waste sites in the zzso may lead to considerable expenditure of resources without any meaningful reduction in population zzso zzso assessment methods used generally ignore background zzso and consider only incremental risk estimates for zzso exposed zzso Such risk estimates do not address true public health risks to which background zzso also zzso The purpose of this paper is to recommend a new approach to risk assessment and risk management concerning toxic waste zzso Under this new approach, which we have called public health risk assessment, chemical substances would be classified into a level of concern based on the potential health risks associated with typical national and regional background zzso Site assessment would then be based on the level of concern for the particular pollutants involved and the potential contribution of site zzso to typical background human zzso While various problems can be foreseen with this approach, the key advantage is that resources would be allocated to reduce the most important sources of human exposure, and site zzso decisions could be simplified by zzso on exposure assessment rather than questionable risk zzso
