zzso cells zzso are increasingly applied as a cellular zzso in zzso of zzso Two major zzso DC zzso are zzso zzso DC zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso that line zzso zzso Yet, functional differences between zzso and zzso remain to be zzso We recently showed that the zzso acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso supports differentiation of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso By comparative functional characterization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we aimed to zzso the relative abilities of these two DC zzso to induce a specific T cell response and reveal the more suitable candidate for use as a clinical vehicle of tumor zzso Although mature zzso and zzso displayed comparable zzso zzso potential, mature zzso showed higher zzso T cell zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso supported the induction of tumor zzso zzso T cells at an overall higher zzso This might be related to the observed inability of zzso to release T cell zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Although this inability did not result in a zzso zzso in the zzso expression profile of primed T cells, zzso with zzso significantly improved zzso efficiency of zzso and ensured a functional zzso with zzso in this zzso In conclusion, except for the inability of zzso to release distinct type 1 T cell zzso zzso in zzso function of zzso and zzso suggests comparable abilities of both zzso for the in zzso induction of zzso T zzso
