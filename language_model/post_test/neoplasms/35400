Previous studies have suggested that zzso may have a low association with tolerance development compared with other strong zzso In a previous study by our group, mean cohort and zzso dosage increases over an entire course of treatment and on a zzso basis were significantly lower with zzso zzso zzso than with TD zzso However, no information concerning the relationship between qualitative and quantitative dose changes is zzso 

The aim of this study was to compare TD zzso and TD zzso with respect to dosage increases, dosage stability, and the nature of dosage zzso 

This retrospective analysis used data from the IMS Disease zzso database, which contains zzso data documented by 400 medical practices in zzso Data from patients with zzso or cancer pain treated with TD zzso or TD zzso for at least 3 months between May 2002 and April 2005 were zzso Daily zzso were directly determined from the prescribed patch strength, taking into account the possibility of multiple patches applied zzso To determine dosage stability, patients were classified based on the type of dosage change zzso increase, zzso or zzso of the prescribed zzso From the prescribed daily zzso mean percentage increases were calculated on a zzso basis for the entire treatment period and per day, and these were assessed in relation to the type of dosage zzso 

In total, zzso patients with zzso pain and zzso patients with cancer pain were included in the analysis zzso women, zzso zzso mean age, zzso years zzso zzso zzso Treatment indications included zzso low back pain, osteoporosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Patients had similar zzso zzso requirements based on steps 1 to 3 of the World Health Organization zzso zzso zzso requirements for breakthrough pain were also similar between the TD zzso and TD zzso zzso The mean percentage increases per day were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso groups and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the cancer groups zzso P zzso zzso A significantly larger proportion of patients receiving TD zzso had stable zzso over the entire treatment period compared with patients receiving TD zzso zzso groups: zzso vs zzso cancer groups: zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso Compared with TD zzso the proportion of patients with alternating dosage changes was significantly greater in patients receiving TD zzso zzso groups: zzso vs zzso cancer groups: zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In this retrospective data analysis, compared with TD zzso the increase in mean daily dosage was significantly greater in patients treated with TD zzso Also, compared with TD zzso alternating dosage changes were seen in a significantly greater proportion of patients receiving TD zzso On the other hand, a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with TD zzso had stable zzso over their entire treatment zzso
