zzso cancer zzso is gaining momentum in recent years due to the growing number of therapeutic zzso zzso that are receiving approval for clinical trials and are currently used in clinical cancer zzso Even though some zzso zzso have shown moderate therapeutic zzso most of them still lag behind, having failed to produce adequately effective zzso The urging need for a therapeutic platform that will enhance both the zzso and cellular effects of zzso treatment zzso the design of more effective zzso zzso for enhancing zzso tumor zzso in cancer zzso Cancer cells express or zzso host zzso and zzso complement regulators in order to evade complement attack and establish an zzso zzso for tumor zzso Moreover, membrane complement regulators appear to zzso several aspects of zzso immunity that are relevant to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, the concept that complement zzso is zzso for tumor growth has been drastically challenged by evidence that points to a novel zzso role of complement in the tumor zzso Taken together, these findings form a new conceptual framework that zzso innate immunity to cancer zzso Furthermore, they are anticipated to lead to the rational design of strategies that will exploit innate immune systems, such as complement, in a zzso zzso manner for effective cancer zzso
