To estimate the prevalence of important side effects in patients with zzso disease who were receiving high doses of zzso as part of their zzso zzso 

Data on patients were collected over 12 zzso 

Two zzso care units in Western zzso 

19 Patients with zzso disease who were receiving zzso either zzso or orally as the main zzso 10 Patients receiving a total daily dose of zzso of at least 500 zzso orally or 250 zzso zzso were enrolled in the zzso The other 9 patients were enrolled after an important problem thought to be related to the zzso had been zzso All of the patients were taking drugs to supplement the zzso 

The dose of zzso or route of administration, or both, was changed in three zzso 

zzso of the prevalence of side effects in the zzso Assessment of the relation of any side effects with the supplemental drugs taken by the zzso 

Plasma zzso and zzso zzso were measured and a full history taken for each zzso Thirteen of the 19 patients had an important side zzso 12 of them had zzso and one had zzso of the zzso Plasma zzso zzso were similar in patients with and without zzso ranging from 158 to zzso zzso and 39 to zzso zzso zzso Eight of the patients with side effects were taking an antipsychotic drug zzso compared with none of those without side zzso A greater proportion of patients with side effects were taking the zzso drug zzso zzso v zzso and at least one zzso zzso drug zzso v zzso whereas a smaller proportion were taking a zzso zzso v zzso The estimated prevalence of important side effects in the total population of patients receiving zzso treatment in the two units was zzso 

zzso as a side effect of treatment with zzso is more likely to occur in patients taking zzso or antipsychotic drugs as zzso or as zzso agents or zzso zzso drugs for additional zzso If a patient develops zzso the best approach may be to change the supplemental zzso
