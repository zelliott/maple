zzso differentials in cancer survival have occasionally been studied by using a relative survival approach, where all cause mortality among persons with a cancer diagnosis is compared with that among similar persons without such a diagnosis zzso zzso One should zzso take into account that this zzso mortality not only depends on age, sex, and period, but also various other zzso zzso However, this has very rarely been zzso A method that permits such variations to be considered is presented here, as an alternative to an existing technique, and is compared with a relative survival model where these variations are disregarded and two other methods that have often been zzso 

The focus is on how education and marital status affect the survival from 12 common cancer types among men and women aged zzso Four different types of hazard models are estimated, and differences between effects are zzso The data are from registers and zzso and cover the entire Norwegian population for the years zzso There are more than 100 zzso deaths to cancer patients in this zzso 

A model for registered cancer mortality among cancer patients gives results that for most, but not all, sites are very similar to those from a relative survival approach where educational or marital variations in zzso mortality are taken into zzso A relative survival approach without consideration of these zzso variations in zzso mortality gives more different results, the most extreme example being the doubling of the marital differentials in survival from prostate zzso When neither sufficient data on cause of death nor on variations in zzso mortality are available, one may well choose the simplest method, which is to model all cause mortality among cancer zzso There is little reason to bother with the zzso of a zzso model that does not allow zzso variations in zzso mortality beyond those related to age, sex, and zzso Fortunately, both these less data demanding models perform well for the most aggressive zzso
