Alternative zzso of zzso precursors enables one gene to produce multiple protein zzso with differing zzso Under normal conditions, this mechanism is tightly regulated in order for the human zzso to generate zzso diversity sufficient for the functional requirements of complex zzso When zzso however, cancer cells take advantage of this mechanism to produce zzso proteins with added, deleted, or altered functional zzso that contribute to zzso Here, we discuss aspects of alternative zzso zzso in cancer, focusing on zzso events affected by deregulation of regulatory zzso factors and also recent studies identifying zzso components of the zzso zzso 

An increasing body of evidence indicates that zzso zzso of zzso precursors leads to production of zzso proteins that contribute to zzso Recent studies show that zzso in cellular zzso of regulatory zzso factors and zzso in components of the core zzso machinery provide major mechanisms of zzso of zzso zzso in zzso A better understanding of this zzso will potentially reveal a group of novel drug targets for therapeutic zzso
