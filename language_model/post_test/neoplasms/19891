In the last decade, an ever-growing number of connections between zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso have uncovered a new level of complexity of gene expression regulation in zzso In this review, we examine several aspects of the functional interactions between zzso and zzso in cancer zzso We will provide examples of zzso zzso zzso regulating the expression of zzso or the zzso where an zzso protein specifically regulates the expression of a specific zzso or when an zzso can exert a widespread effect on zzso via the zzso of a key protein for zzso production or zzso Moreover, we will focus on the ever-growing number of functional interactions that have been discovered in the last few years: zzso that were shown to cooperate with zzso in the zzso of shared target zzso or, on the contrary, that inhibit zzso action, thus resulting in a protection of the specific target zzso We surely need to obtain a deeper comprehension of such intricate networks to have a chance of understanding and, thus, fighting zzso
