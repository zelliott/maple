The purpose of this study was to evaluate a dual head coincidence gamma camera zzso equipped with zzso transmission for zzso zzso imaging in zzso zzso zzso patients with known or suspected zzso scheduled for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were first studied with a dedicated ring PET and subsequently with zzso All patients underwent measured zzso correction using zzso rod sources for ring PET and zzso sources for zzso Ring PET zzso scan was started zzso zzso after intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso and zzso images were reconstructed for ring PET and zzso The image sets were evaluated independently by three observers blinded to clinical data and to results of conventional zzso zzso ring PET as the standard of reference depicted 118 zzso zzso ring PET 113 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 101 zzso and 84 zzso zzso respectively zzso The zzso detection rate of zzso and zzso zzso was almost similar for zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso correction increased the detection rate from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis revealed zzso results relative to zzso ring PET for zzso ring zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 42 zzso 36 zzso and 31 zzso patients, zzso zzso might have influenced patient management in two zzso six zzso and ten zzso patients, zzso In conclusion, measured zzso correction markedly improves the zzso detection capability of zzso With measured zzso correction the diagnostic performance of zzso is closer to that of dedicated ring zzso
