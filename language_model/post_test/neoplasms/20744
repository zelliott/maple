This Phase I study was performed to assess the feasibility of combining zzso with the new zzso inhibitor zzso and to determine the dose limiting toxicity of this zzso Fifteen patients received oral zzso alone at a dose escalated from 200 to 300 zzso twice daily zzso cycle zzso an escalating zzso dose of zzso zzso 75, and 100 zzso as a zzso infusion zzso 1), and the combination zzso 2 and zzso zzso limiting toxicity consisting of zzso and zzso fever was reached at the combination of zzso 100 zzso and zzso 300 zzso zzso and the maximum tolerated dose was established at zzso 100 zzso and zzso 200 zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso achieved in patients were in the same range as required in zzso zzso models to overcome zzso zzso The plasma zzso of zzso were not influenced by the zzso regimen at any dose level tested, as indicated by plasma clearance values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cycles 1 and 2, zzso These findings indicate that the contribution of a zzso inhibitor to the activity of zzso chemotherapy can now be assessed in patients for the first time independent of its effect on drug zzso
