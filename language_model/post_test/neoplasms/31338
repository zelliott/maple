The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso regulatory zzso zzso is zzso in cancer zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso analogue that zzso zzso and zzso the growth of a wide range of cancer cells in zzso and in zzso We performed a Phase I trial of zzso in 32 patients with zzso that were zzso to standard zzso zzso was initially given in a zzso cycle by constant infusion at zzso zzso for 21 days, followed by 1 week of zzso The dose was escalated to zzso zzso but zzso became the zzso zzso The length of drug administration was, therefore, reduced to 5 days per week for the first 3 weeks of the cycle, but it was not possible to increase the drug dose without producing zzso zzso the length of drug administration was reduced to 3 days per week for the first 3 weeks of the zzso The maximum tolerated dose for this regimen was zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso disease for zzso or zzso months was observed in two patients treated at zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is involved in zzso and zzso zzso and so representative hormone, zzso and peripheral zzso zzso were zzso The drug had a zzso zzso effect on calcium zzso and significantly increased circulating zzso hormone and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is well tolerated without attendant zzso and in this study, it was associated with biological zzso In Phase II studies, a dose of zzso zzso for 3 days per week would be zzso
