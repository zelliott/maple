Motor vehicle emissions are a major source of air pollution in zzso Past studies have suggested that zzso zzso can increase the risk of childhood cancer, particularly zzso 

From California's zzso zzso cancer registry, we identified zzso diagnosed in children younger than 5 years of age between 1988 and zzso We matched these cases to California birth zzso For each case, we randomly selected 2 control birth zzso matched by birth date and zzso For each mother's residential address at the time of her child's birth, we calculated road density by summing the length of all roads within a zzso radius of the zzso Traffic density was based on road lengths and vehicle traffic counts for highways and major zzso 

The zzso of road and traffic density values were very similar for the zzso cases and zzso matched control zzso For all cancer sites combined, the odds ratio zzso for the highest road density exposure category, compared with the zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso For all sites combined and for zzso the zzso were also below zzso for the highest traffic density exposure category zzso for zzso For central nervous system tumors, the OR was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In a large study with good power, we found no increased cancer risk among offspring of mothers living in high traffic density areas for all cancer sites or zzso
