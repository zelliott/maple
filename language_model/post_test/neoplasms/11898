After discussion of the causes of natural selectivity of zzso it is pointed out that, thanks to recent advances in cell zzso zzso selection of zzso combined with zzso of zzso supply in the zzso region of cancer zzso zzso treatment of cancer is developing into a theoretically founded and modifiable zzso Within the zzso of closely related problems it is especially the studies on zzso of zzso that still are in zzso The discussed course of such an investigation basis zzso the zzso of cancer zzso zzso the often inadequate zzso parameters that deteriorate even further with growing tumor zzso -- The given zzso equation for a change in the concentration of a zzso in tumor tissue has been evaluated zzso for an example, a substance from the zzso group whose mass number approximately zzso with that of zzso in its active zzso As far as the better zzso cancer tissue farther from the zzso are concerned zzso early stages of tumors and zzso the effective dose only drops from 1 to about zzso In poorly zzso cancer zzso on the other hand, the respective effective dose is reduced from 1 to zzso zzso Unfortunately, however, this drop in effective dose takes place exactly in a location where the most resistant zzso of tumor cells are to be zzso A feasible way out this crucial dilemma inherent in the chemotherapy of cancer is to combine a substance of low mass zzso that causes a pronounced long-term stimulation of body own zzso zzso our BA 1, and zzso with a zzso like zzso that -- in zzso zzso cancer zzso -- reaches its active form only at a reduced pH so that zzso to normal zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso caused by the first mentioned substance is not zzso
