In clinical radiation zzso it is commonly reported that complications of normal tissue occur more readily at larger field sizes for a given dose and recurrence of disease is observed more frequently from the larger tumors for a given zzso zzso phenomena have long been observed in the study of the strength of zzso That is, the larger specimens will fracture under less applied stress, breakdown under less applied zzso zzso in a shorter time, zzso The statistical theory of extreme values has provided both a rational explanation and a technique for exploitation of these zzso zzso on the likelihood of zzso zzso This theory describes the relation which exists between the parameters (in particular, the location zzso of the frequency zzso of the extreme values zzso zzso and largest zzso in a sample from a population of observations zzso and the sample size zzso It is shown in the present paper that the clinical failure phenomena are not inconsistent with the statistical theory of extreme zzso The paper presents zzso comparisons of the predictions of this theory with the received clinical observations of the effect of the size of the volume of zzso zzso on the likelihood of occurrence of the misadventures of clinical radiation zzso recurrence of disease and complication of normal zzso The zzso of observations and predictions is zzso The quality and quantity of the currently available data have precluded the construction of any zzso zzso
