The zzso zzso hypothesis has been formulated by a number of authors as a zzso zzso However, most previous models assumed zzso zzso in the population of cells, and included no information about spatial zzso In this work, we studied the role of spatial dynamics in zzso We formulated a zzso spatial zzso of a constant population zzso zzso process, and described the dynamics zzso We found that in the spatial model, the probability of fixation of advantageous and zzso zzso is lower, and the rate of generation of zzso zzso (the so-called zzso zzso is higher, compared to those for the zzso zzso This means that the results previously obtained for zzso models give an zzso for rates of cancer initiation in the case where the first event is the generation of a zzso zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso
