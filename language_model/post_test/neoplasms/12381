zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is becoming accepted as a diagnostic tool for cancer, but the potential uses of PET in zzso extend beyond the imaging of zzso zzso The development of a PET proliferation probe would be a useful zzso zzso zzso PET has been assessed in man as a specific measure of tumor zzso zzso of zzso is related to DNA synthesis and, in human tumors, zzso with zzso When compared with zzso it has been shown to be a more sensitive zzso of early clinical tumor zzso zzso PET scanning of patients enrolled in early phase clinical trials is feasible and should support future drug zzso Although recent research is moving away from the validation of zzso towards zzso zzso zzso with zzso the better specificity of zzso for DNA should be the rationale for its continued development and application as a PET zzso This review describes the historical development, application and current research status of zzso zzso and aims to highlight the need for its continuing development as a marker of tumor zzso
