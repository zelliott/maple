zzso to restore the zzso system were originally performed with cells from the bone zzso zzso zzso which was considered the only cell source zzso zzso zzso zzso The discovery that chemotherapy induced the zzso of zzso cells into the peripheral blood zzso zzso gave rise to the successful zzso transplantation of zzso zzso zzso Also zzso blood zzso was found to contain considerable numbers of zzso zzso and to date at least 42 zzso zzso have been performed with this cell source zzso zzso Wagner, personal zzso Further investigations led to the successful zzso transplantation of positively selected zzso cells from zzso and zzso zzso and the latest results indicate that it is promising to transplant zzso zzso cells obtained from zzso donors zzso 10, zzso Despite such achievements it remains unclear how many zzso zzso are required per zzso of the recipient and how they are zzso zzso In this communication we give examples of typical differences observed by flow zzso and zzso zzso between the zzso cells contained in the different cell zzso They may explain why it is not sufficient only to analyze the zzso cell populations which may represent zzso of different lineages as well as of various states of zzso CB zzso cells are early zzso zzso cells with the highest zzso of zzso among the three cell zzso They have a high zzso potential in zzso They hardly zzso B cell zzso and they are partially negative for zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
