zzso zzso are drugs of first choice for zzso in cancer zzso We sought to determine the optimal use of zzso in cancer surgery in standard clinical zzso 

A retrospective, zzso audit on the use of zzso in patients undergoing cancer surgery and given prophylaxis with zzso was zzso zzso assessment of zzso zzso zzso risk zzso or zzso was compared to the criteria of current Consensus zzso for zzso zzso We assessed the zzso of documented symptomatic zzso bleeding events, zzso deaths and total events related to zzso or zzso prophylaxis zzso zzso zzso The potential economic impact of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso 

Clinical records from 197 patients from 5 Spanish zzso were zzso zzso was started zzso in 45 patients zzso According to the zzso criteria, 73 zzso patients were at high zzso risk and received zzso zzso zzso However, according to the criteria of current zzso 189 zzso patients were at high risk of zzso zzso zzso Three zzso patients, all of them receiving zzso zzso zzso developed a symptomatic confirmed zzso There were 4 major and 5 minor bleeding events during zzso zzso A lower zzso of bleeding zzso zzso zzso zzso and total events zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen with zzso started zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso rates did not significantly differ between patients given low or high zzso zzso doses zzso zzso zzso zzso Two patients died due to zzso failure and zzso zzso zzso zzso provided net cost savings of zzso euro per patient compared to zzso start of prophylaxis due to shorter hospital stays (9 zzso 11 zzso and lower zzso of complications in the zzso zzso zzso 

Many cancer patients are still poorly assessed for risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with a lower zzso of zzso without significant increase in complications as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prophylaxis seems to be as effective and safer than zzso start of zzso Further prospective clinical studies are needed to fully address this zzso
