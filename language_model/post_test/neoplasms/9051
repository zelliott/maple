Emerging trends for cancer chemotherapy show promising developments with the better understanding of molecules delivering more potent and powerful zzso But these are severely limited because of increased side effects and higher probability of tumor zzso In this scenario, putative exploration of the indigenous and untapped resources modulating immune system to deliver adequate but potent zzso effects appeals considerable zzso However, these require rigorous scientific validation with regard to potency compared with the existing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a plant component of zzso zzso zzso zzso is known for its widespread medicinal zzso But the zzso potential has not been explored in comparison to existing zzso zzso Our attempt contributes the scientific evidence for beneficial zzso and zzso functions in mice challenged with zzso tumors, Dalton's zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso either alone or in combination with zzso and zzso Specifically, the petroleum zzso extracts of this plant zzso zzso activated a cascade of host defense mechanisms by stimulating or restoring total white blood cell count, zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation and functions zzso and zzso either naturally or under conditions of impaired immunity like in zzso tumor or during standard agent zzso Overall, zzso also zzso strong zzso effects by increasing median survival time and life span, while reducing zzso zzso tumor volume and viable tumor counts on par with zzso and zzso especially when administered zzso This study also identified 2 putative zzso zzso and zzso which could be zzso the zzso and zzso effects in zzso tumor zzso Thus, our attempts provide sufficient proof to warrant further to test this drug in higher animal models or in patients with high risk for tumor recurrence and/or zzso zzso
