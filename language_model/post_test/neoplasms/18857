T cells engineered to express zzso specific for tumor zzso can drive cancer zzso The first zzso used in cancer gene therapy, zzso and zzso recognize two structurally distinct zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso both presented by the class I zzso protein zzso To help understand the mechanisms of zzso zzso and provide a foundation for the further development of zzso we determined the zzso structures of zzso and zzso in complex with both of the zzso zzso The two zzso use different mechanisms to accommodate the two zzso Although zzso binds the two with a different orientation, altering its position over the zzso zzso binds them both zzso The simpler mode of zzso by zzso is associated with higher affinity toward both zzso consistent with the superior functional zzso of zzso More generally, the observation of two zzso mechanisms of zzso with the same zzso and the finding that zzso orientation can be determined by zzso alone extend our understanding of the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso
