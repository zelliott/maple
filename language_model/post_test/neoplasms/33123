zzso materials can be expected to be useful as zzso seeds for zzso treatment of cancer, especially where the cancer is located in deep parts of body, as they can generate heat by magnetic zzso loss when they are placed in an alternating magnetic zzso Recently, it was reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter prepared in zzso solution can show excellent heat generating zzso However, these zzso have many cracks on their zzso In this study, the preparation conditions for the zzso was further zzso in order to obtain zzso zzso zzso and the in zzso heat generation of the obtained zzso was measured in an zzso phantom under an alternating magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter were obtained zzso Their zzso zzso and coercive force were 68 zzso zzso and 198 zzso zzso Their heat generation under an alternating magnetic field of 300 zzso at 100 zzso was estimated to be 42 W zzso The zzso showed in zzso heat generation when they were dispersed in an zzso phantom and placed under an alternating magnetic zzso It is believed that these zzso may be useful for the in zzso zzso treatment of zzso
