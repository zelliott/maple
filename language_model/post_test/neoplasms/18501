While zzso zzso zzso zzso is an established mechanism to rapidly degrade select zzso the zzso regulation and biological significance of zzso are not well zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso is inhibited in hypoxic zzso Here we show that the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso initiation factor 2 zzso translation initiation factor by a variety of cellular stresses leads to the zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso zzso occur in zzso To explore the significance of this zzso regulation, we used an unbiased approach to identify approximately 750 zzso zzso and found that these zzso are overrepresented in stress response and zzso zzso zzso with these findings, the zzso of zzso promotes cellular resistance to zzso zzso stress and encourages tumor zzso The zzso and zzso regulations of gene expression by the zzso are established mechanisms by which tumor cells adapt to zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso by the tumor zzso is also an important mechanism to zzso regulate genes critical for the response to cellular stress and zzso
