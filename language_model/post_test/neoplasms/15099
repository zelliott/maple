Use of short interfering zzso zzso is a promising new approach thought to have a strong potential to lead to rapid development of zzso zzso Here, we describe a newly developed, zzso zzso zzso vehicle, the zzso zzso which contains zzso and a zzso zzso complex in a core that is fully enveloped by a neutral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protected zzso from zzso zzso providing a long zzso in the systemic zzso Moreover, zzso leaked from blood vessels within tumors into the tumor zzso where it accumulated and was subsequently zzso into the tumor zzso Because the zzso factor zzso is known to play a role in tumor zzso we designed zzso to test the zzso activity of zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso activity, although neither zzso containing control zzso nor saline containing zzso affected tumor zzso zzso inhibited zzso expression within tumors at both zzso and protein levels, significantly reducing zzso and we detected no significant acute or long-term zzso Our findings support the idea that zzso can be used to knock down specific genes within tumors and thereby exert therapeutic effects against zzso
