zzso are dynamic zzso structures that mediate zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation to facilitate cell zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso and is therefore known as zzso zzso protein 1 zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso recycling and zzso ruffle zzso However, it is not known whether zzso regulates zzso formation or cell zzso In this study, we found that zzso zzso to zzso and is necessary for the formation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Despite their structural zzso zzso and zzso play distinct roles in zzso zzso zzso was necessary for the formation of zzso dots, whereas zzso was necessary for the formation of organized zzso zzso in zzso zzso We identified specific zzso zzso sites, zzso and zzso of zzso which mediate the formation of zzso zzso and degradation of the zzso In contrast to zzso ruffles, the interaction of zzso with zzso protein zzso was not necessary for the formation of zzso zzso Finally, we showed that depletion of zzso increased invasive cell migration, suggesting that zzso zzso regulates zzso degradation and cell zzso zzso our findings identify a role for zzso in zzso zzso formation and cell invasion downstream of zzso
