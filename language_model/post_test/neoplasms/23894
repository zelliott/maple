zzso a new zzso zzso was zzso more active than zzso in zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso This zzso modulating activity of zzso was confirmed on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, with respect to zzso D, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso more active than zzso depending on the cell line and the zzso agent used, zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso only had a slight effect on zzso zzso and retention by parental sensitive cells, as well as on their sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso fully restored zzso zzso and retention by zzso cells zzso cells zzso by the zzso 1 zzso to a level similar to that measured in zzso cells, leading to a blockade in the zzso + M phase of the cell zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso activity by restoring its cellular zzso in resistant zzso After a short incubation period of cells with zzso (4 zzso a condition close to the clinical administration of this zzso agent, a zzso for 20 hours more with 5 zzso zzso fully restored the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso After an exposure of 4 hours at equal zzso the zzso of zzso was zzso that of zzso in zzso cells, and 20 hours after the removal of the zzso zzso was retained at a concentration zzso that of zzso zzso is therefore a powerful new modifier of the zzso zzso which by its pharmacological properties zzso zzso and zzso might be used in combination with existing chemotherapy against tumors displaying the zzso zzso
