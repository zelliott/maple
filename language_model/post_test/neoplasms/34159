Most evidence indicates that zzso bone zzso are due to zzso factors that stimulate the zzso This review supports a zzso role for zzso Based on our results, we propose a model to explain the tumor cell and bone interactions that are responsible for the zzso response zzso zzso zzso cells housed in bone produce factors, such as zzso stimulate zzso zzso This results in the abundant and zzso new bone formation that is characteristic of zzso zzso The effects of zzso to stimulate bone formation are zzso by ETA receptors on the zzso ETA zzso zzso successfully blocked zzso bone zzso in a mouse zzso These zzso zzso are currently in clinical trials for advanced prostate cancer and bone zzso zzso 2001; zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso are complex and involve zzso interactions between tumor cells and zzso zzso of the interactions at a molecular level can identify therapeutic targets for zzso zzso Although zzso and ETA receptors are potential targets for this devastating complication of cancer zzso et zzso 2003), they are certainly not the only zzso The rapid pace of zzso research, will not only expand our therapeutic zzso against bone zzso but will also provide insight into achieving the ultimate goal: the prevention of cancer zzso to zzso
