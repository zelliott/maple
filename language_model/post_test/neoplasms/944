Until few years ago, all zzso cells within a zzso were suggested to have zzso capacity, but recent zzso hint to the possibility that such feature is confined to a subset of Cancer zzso zzso zzso also called Cancer Stem zzso zzso These cells are the zzso of the zzso populations of differentiated cancer cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso shared with zzso stem cells, such as zzso zzso ability, zzso division and zzso resistance, allow to these cells to drive zzso growth and to evade conventional zzso 

Here, we give a brief overview on the origin of zzso the mechanisms involved in zzso and therapeutic zzso 

Current cancer treatments, based on the assumption that zzso cell population responds zzso have been developed to eradicate zzso zzso The new model of zzso zzso significant therapeutic zzso in fact if a small fraction of zzso survives conventional therapy it may lead to recurrence after month or years of apparent zzso Selective targeting of zzso could eliminate the zzso from the zzso overcoming the emergence of clones capable of evading traditional therapy and increasing overall disease free zzso
