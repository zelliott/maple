In Brazil cancer zzso rates have to be estimated from occasional surveys, due to lack of continuous cancer zzso Many estimated rates have very large zzso because only few years of data were zzso When dealing with a single cancer site, it is possible to adopt a zzso method which borrows information about the cancer rates from other geographical areas to estimate the cancer rate in a given zzso We suggest an additional improvement to this method which explores the correlation between multiple cancer sites rates in a same area and in different zzso 

Our method works with a zzso zzso of different cancer sites rates in several areas and it borrows information from both, across geographical areas and across different cancer zzso We applied our method to data from a survey carried out in 18 Brazilian cities in zzso Paulo State in zzso We estimated age and sex indirect standardized zzso rates for the six most common zzso in men and women, and calculated the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso 

The usual indirect standardized zzso rates had very large confidence intervals for many zzso and cities due to small expected number of zzso The use of the zzso zzso method led to more precise zzso 

More precise zzso cancer zzso rates can be calculated using data from other zzso The method is zzso simple, easy to perform, has low cost, and can improve substantially the zzso of cancer zzso and other vital zzso
