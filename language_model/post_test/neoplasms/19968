This paper compares the predictions of zzso demand for England from the zzso model with those from the earlier National zzso Advisory Group zzso model, from the international literature and also with observed zzso usage in England as a whole as recorded in the English zzso zzso zzso 

We reviewed the evidence base for zzso for each type and stage of cancer using national and international guidelines, zzso systematic reviews and key clinical zzso Twenty-two decision trees were constructed and zzso demand was calculated using English cancer zzso data for 2007, 2008 and 2009, accurate to the zzso Care Trust zzso level zzso zzso The stage at presentation was obtained from English cancer registry zzso In zzso mode, the model can take account of changes in cancer zzso as the population grows and zzso 

The zzso model indicates reduced indications for zzso principally for lung cancer and rarer zzso Our estimate of the proportion of patients who should receive zzso at some stage of their illness is zzso This is lower than previous estimates of about zzso Nevertheless, the overall estimate of demand in terms of zzso is similar for the zzso and zzso zzso The latter models that zzso zzso should have been delivered per million population in zzso National data from zzso show 32,071 zzso per million in zzso A 50% increase in activity would be required to match estimated zzso This zzso extends across all zzso and represents reduced access and the use of dose zzso at odds with international norms of evidence-based zzso By 2016, demand is predicted to grow to about zzso zzso per million and by 2020 to zzso 

Services have increased their activity by zzso between 2006 and 2011, but estimated demand has increased by zzso Access remains low and English zzso dose zzso still does not comply with international evidence-based zzso
