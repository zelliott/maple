When a zzso zzso at low doses can be zzso an acceptable daily intake for a zzso can be obtained by dividing a benchmark dose, associated with a low zzso of tumors in animals, by uncertainty factors to account for zzso zzso human zzso and risk reduction from a low observed zzso zzso This approach can zzso zzso information to justify smaller uncertainty factors than typical default values of zzso If a zzso zzso cannot be zzso traditional linear zzso from the benchmark dose to zero sometimes gives similar zzso This suggests a unified zzso procedure based on uncertainty zzso The issue of zzso zzso based on the risk relative to background risks, rather than excess risk, is zzso The relative risk approach reduces the estimates of cancer risk in humans based on common zzso tumors, such as the liver in some strains of zzso
