The zzso protein is a potential zzso of transcription, with the ability to bind in a zzso form with Max to DNA sequences containing the core zzso sequence zzso These properties are shared with zzso a zzso zzso expressed in small cell lung zzso zzso with zzso expressed in zzso zzso and with avian zzso the zzso zzso expressed by a chicken zzso The zzso and probably zzso proteins also have zzso DNA binding function, which may improve the zzso of specific DNA zzso zzso this domain appears not to be zzso in zzso or zzso zzso The data that have accumulated to date are consistent with a model in which a zzso zzso positively regulates the zzso of zzso zzso with Max zzso functioning as a negative regulator of the same genes zzso 4) zzso Max is expressed zzso at low levels, whereas zzso is expressed at low levels in zzso cells, but high levels of zzso are induced by zzso stimulation zzso Thus, in zzso cells zzso zzso might bind to the regulatory elements of zzso zzso where the zzso zzso might stimulate zzso zzso in zzso cells with little zzso present, Max zzso might zzso They might bind to exactly the same regulatory zzso but due to the apparent absence of a zzso in Max zzso zzso might be zzso zzso of this model will require the demonstration of clear regulation of a zzso promoter of a zzso gene by zzso Although it is widely believed that zzso proteins function as zzso zzso this hypothesis has only been zzso supported recently zzso zzso A theory that zzso plays a role in DNA replication is not as well substantiated at this zzso It is even possible that zzso might be involved in both zzso and zzso Although the function of these fascinating proteins has been enigmatic for a decade, the rate of progress in our understanding of zzso function is zzso Such progress will undoubtedly lead to a deeper appreciation of this zzso which lies at the crossroads of cellular proliferation and zzso
