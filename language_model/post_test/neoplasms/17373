Though the concepts of magnetic fluid zzso zzso were originally proposed over 50 years ago, the technique has yet to be successfully translated into routine clinical zzso zzso challenges must be addressed if the field is to progress and zzso its potential as an option for treatment of diseases such as zzso These challenges include determining the optimum fields and zzso that zzso the effectiveness of zzso without significant zzso zzso effects on healthy zzso achieving sufficient zzso of magnetic zzso zzso within the target zzso and developing a better zzso understanding of zzso energy deposition and its effects on cells and zzso On the other hand, emerging experimental evidence indicates that local zzso effects indeed occur in the vicinity of zzso zzso These findings point to the opportunity of engineering zzso for the selective destruction of cells and/or zzso structures without the need for a zzso tissue temperature rise, in what we here call zzso zzso energy delivery zzso
