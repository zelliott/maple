zzso with Down syndrome zzso have a predisposition to leukemia and possibly other zzso and excess mortality from other conditions, but information on the magnitude of risk associated with specific zzso or causes of death is zzso 

zzso experience and cancer zzso were evaluated in a combined cohort of zzso individuals with a hospital discharge diagnosis of zzso in Sweden zzso or Denmark zzso by linkage to national cancer and vital statistics zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso and standardized mortality ratios zzso were estimated by comparison with age, sex, and zzso expected zzso 

zzso with zzso had an increased risk of incident acute zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) and liver cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) were also zzso zzso with zzso also experienced elevated mortality attributed to stomach cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso other heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cerebrovascular disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infectious diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso anomalies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso have a substantially increased risk of mortality due to specific causes and may have an elevated risk of other incident zzso in addition to zzso These results provide clues regarding zzso 21 gene involvement in diseases that complicate zzso and are important for disease detection and care of affected zzso
