zzso to zzso agents, occurring in zzso to 50% of patients, is a major limitation to the treatment of zzso zzso We have zzso evaluated whether intravenous iron can increase the proportion of patients with zzso anemia who respond to zzso 

Between December 2004 and February 2006, 149 patients with zzso zzso breast, and zzso zzso and zzso 12 weeks of planned chemotherapy were enrolled from 33 zzso Patients were required to have zzso zzso 11 zzso and no absolute or functional iron zzso All patients received zzso 150 zzso zzso once weekly for 12 weeks and were randomly assigned to sodium zzso zzso 125 zzso zzso zzso weekly for the first 6 weeks zzso zzso zzso or no iron zzso zzso zzso zzso end point of the study was the percentage of patients achieving zzso response zzso zzso 12 zzso or zzso 2 zzso zzso 

zzso response by zzso analysis was zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Among patients fulfilling eligibility criteria and having received at least four zzso zzso zzso responses in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso group zzso zzso 50) were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso during treatment period showed a time profile favoring zzso with statistically significant effect from week 5 zzso The safety profile was comparable in the two zzso 

In patients with zzso anemia and no iron zzso IV iron supplementation significantly reduces treatment failures to zzso without additional zzso
