For the vast majority of chemicals that have cancer potency estimates on zzso the underlying database is deficient with respect to zzso zzso This data gap has prevented derivation of cancer potency factors that are relevant to this time period, and so assessments may not fully address children's zzso This article provides a review of juvenile animal zzso data in comparison to adult animal data for a broad array of zzso This comparison indicates that short-term zzso in early life are likely to yield a greater tumor response than short-term zzso in adults, but similar tumor response when compared to long-term zzso in zzso This evidence is brought into a risk assessment context by proposing an approach that: zzso does not zzso children's zzso over the entire life span or mix them with zzso that occur at other zzso zzso applies the cancer slope factor from adult animal or human epidemiology studies to the children's exposure dose to calculate the cancer risk associated with the zzso zzso and zzso adds the cancer risk for young children to that for older zzso to yield a total lifetime cancer zzso The proposed approach allows for the unique exposure and zzso factors associated with young children to be fully weighted in the cancer risk zzso It is very similar to the approach currently used by zzso zzso for vinyl zzso The current analysis finds that the database of early life and adult cancer zzso supports extension of this approach from vinyl zzso to other zzso of diverse mode of zzso This approach should be enhanced by zzso data specific to the particular zzso under analysis whenever zzso
