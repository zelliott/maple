Identification of zzso single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a necessary step in defining the zzso landscapes of zzso Experimental designs for zzso zzso of zzso zzso now routinely include next-generation sequencing zzso of zzso DNA and matched constitutional DNA from the same zzso This allows investigators to control for zzso zzso and distinguish zzso zzso that are unique to the zzso thus reducing the burden of zzso and expensive downstream experiments needed to verify initial zzso In order to make full use of such paired zzso zzso tools for simultaneous analysis of zzso paired sequence data are required, but are currently zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso 

In this contribution, we introduce two novel zzso zzso models called zzso and zzso for jointly zzso paired zzso digital zzso count data from zzso zzso In contrast to independent analysis of the zzso and normal data, our method allows statistical strength to be borrowed across the samples and therefore zzso the statistical power to identify and distinguish both zzso and zzso events in a unified zzso zzso 

The zzso models and four other models discussed in the article are part of the zzso software package available for download at zzso
