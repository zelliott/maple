Combined zzso and zzso therapy in in zzso testing has been achieved by means of zzso zzso formed by zzso gold zzso with a protecting shell of porous zzso that contains an zzso zzso We propose a therapeutic zzso that associates the optical activity of small gold zzso zzso with the zzso activity of zzso simultaneously released for the efficient destruction of cancer zzso For this purpose, a method was used for the controlled assembly of gold zzso into stable clusters with a tailored zzso zzso in the zzso spectrum, which involves zzso in alkaline medium of 15 zzso diameter gold zzso protected with a thin zzso zzso zzso were further zzso in an ordered homogeneous zzso zzso coating that provides zzso and stability in zzso zzso After zzso in zzso human zzso cells, these protected gold zzso were able to produce effective zzso under zzso pulse laser zzso of 790 zzso Cell death occurred by combination of a zzso mechanism and mechanical disruption of the membrane cell due to induced generation of zzso bubbles by zzso the water inside the channels of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the incorporation of zzso within the pores of the external zzso which was released during the process, provoked significant cell death zzso This therapeutic model could be of interest for application in the treatment and suppression of zzso zzso
