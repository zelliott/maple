The activity of zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be zzso Several studies have been conducted on the efficacy and safety of different schedules of zzso both in adults and in children, but the optimal schedule has not been zzso 

In the current study, the feasibility and effectiveness of prolonged oral zzso in children with high-risk zzso were zzso Between April 1995 and February 1999, 15 zzso patients with high-risk tumors received oral zzso The schedule of therapy was oral zzso 50 zzso for 10 consecutive days and zzso zzso between zzso zzso was stopped after 1 year of treatment or at time of progressive disease or possible zzso All patients had received zzso zzso in their earlier zzso 

Twelve patients were zzso for tumor zzso After 2 to 4 months of treatment, one patient had complete zzso zzso two had partial response zzso two had minor response zzso two had mixed response zzso three had stable disease zzso and two had progressive disease zzso A useful zzso effect was noted in patients with stable zzso In three patients, oral zzso was administered for maintenance zzso After an average follow-up of zzso months zzso zzso zzso five patients are alive without disease (in three, total surgery was performed after zzso zzso and three patients are alive with zzso Six patients died of progressive disease, and one died of zzso zzso One patient had Grade 34 zzso in the remaining patients, no acute toxicity was observed during zzso 

This schedule of oral zzso produced zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso disease was observed in three patients, one with an zzso zzso one with zzso and one with zzso Given the possible zzso risk, this schedule should be used as a zzso form of therapy or in patients with poor zzso
