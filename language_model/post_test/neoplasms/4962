zzso requires tumor cell dissemination to different zzso from the primary zzso zzso is a complex cell zzso phenomenon that requires the molecular coordination of the zzso zzso invasion and zzso activities of tumor cells to achieve directed cell zzso Recent studies of the spatial and zzso activities of the small zzso have begun to zzso how this coordination is zzso The direct zzso of the pathways involved in zzso zzso invasion and directed migration in dissemination competent tumor cells will help identify the molecular basis of dissemination and allow the design and testing of more specific and selective drugs to block zzso
