Most zzso testing of new therapeutic zzso involves analysis of initial tumor response as opposed to zzso of long-term zzso In this study, the zzso of initial response rates to predict long-term responses was examined for tumors treated with zzso alone compared with heat combined with zzso A total of 130 pet animals with either zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or mast cell zzso were zzso to receive either radiation alone zzso or heat + radiation zzso + zzso zzso to treatment were evaluated by response rates and response zzso The complete response zzso rates were consistently higher for delta + zzso than for zzso across different zzso zzso The combined therapy led to prolonged tumor response in all zzso zzso except zzso which had a longer response duration when treated with zzso alone zzso zzso zzso This was in spite of a relatively high zzso rate in that group zzso versus zzso for delta + zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, while no significant improvement in zzso rate was observed for zzso zzso cell zzso treated with delta + zzso zzso zzso zzso delta + zzso zzso zzso a significant improvement in response duration was noted zzso zzso zzso These are two examples where zzso rate did not predict long-term zzso When all zzso zzso were combined (except zzso the zzso rate was higher zzso less than zzso and response duration was prolonged zzso zzso zzso for delta + zzso compared to zzso zzso
