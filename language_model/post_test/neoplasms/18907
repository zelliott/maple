Since 2000 English cancer policy has directed extra funding towards improving cancer outcomes and quality of zzso Few evaluations have related zzso budget data on cancer spending to population differences, disease burden, outcome or service activity for zzso We used existing routine data to explore these associations for 39 primary care zzso zzso in South East England in zzso 

We plotted the cancer spending reported by zzso in pounds per 100 zzso population against measures of population zzso disease burden and treatment and hospital zzso We explored associations with zzso size, zzso zzso cancer zzso and mortality rates, proportions treated with surgery, zzso and chemotherapy and per capita bed zzso 

Lower per capita spending on cancer was associated with smaller zzso populations and a higher proportion of deprived areas within zzso Higher spending was associated with higher proportions of zzso treatment and higher per capita hospital bed days for zzso 

Cancer spending reported by South East England zzso does not appear to be related to disease burden, but may relate to treatment and service zzso Models are required to relate possible effects of different expenditures and interventions to improve population outcomes for zzso
