zzso application of living cells in zzso medicine requires an understanding of how tissue structure relates to organ zzso There is growing evidence that presentation of zzso cues in a three-dimensional zzso context can fundamentally alter cellular zzso Thus, zzso studies that previously were limited to adherent two-dimensional zzso cultures may not be appropriate for many cell zzso Here we present a method for the rapid formation of zzso high-resolution zzso cellular structures within a zzso zzso using zzso zzso We demonstrate the parallel formation of zzso cell clusters of precise size and shape within a thin zzso zzso and the maintenance of high cell viability and differentiated cell markers over 2 zzso By modulating zzso interactions in zzso zzso we present the first evidence that zzso tissue organization regulates bovine zzso zzso zzso This platform permits investigation of tissue architecture in other zzso zzso from zzso to zzso to zzso
