We performed two-dimensional treatment zzso for ten patients planned and treated with zzso zzso The treatment zzso consisted of a film measurement as well as point dose zzso made with an zzso zzso The agreement between the calculated and the measured film dose zzso was evaluated with the gamma index calculated for three sets of criteria (2 zzso and zzso 4 zzso and zzso and 3 zzso and zzso as recommended in the zzso Good agreement was found between measured and calculated zzso without any need of zzso of the dose data but with dose map registration using reference zzso In this case, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso passed the 2 zzso and zzso 4 zzso and zzso and 3 zzso and zzso criteria, zzso zzso was excellent when both zzso and manual registration of the dose maps was zzso In this case zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso passed the 2 zzso and zzso 4 zzso and zzso and 3 zzso and zzso criteria, zzso The mean percent zzso for the point dose zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the high dose, low dose, and critical structure point, zzso Three criteria for a satisfactory treatment zzso in the high dose regions of a plan were zzso For the zzso reference mark registered data zzso of zzso must pass the 3 zzso and zzso zzso For the zzso and manually registered data, zzso must pass the 2 zzso and zzso criteria, and the point dose measurement must be within zzso of the calculated zzso All low dose zzso structure point dose zzso were evaluated on a patient by patient zzso The criteria we recommend can be useful for the routine evaluation of treatment plans for zzso zzso
