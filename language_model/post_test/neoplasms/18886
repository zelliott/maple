Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle in cancer zzso The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of a folate zzso zzso to zzso drug resistance and to explore the underlying zzso This is accomplished with enhanced cellular zzso and retention of zzso (one of the most effective zzso drugs in use today and a well-known zzso zzso zzso in a zzso cancer zzso The folate zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso backbone with an additional zzso zzso loaded in its zzso zzso In zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso zzso was superior to free zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso proliferation of zzso cancer cells zzso partially due to its enhanced zzso and prolonged zzso zzso In a subcutaneous zzso zzso model, zzso administration enhanced the specific delivery of zzso into tumor zzso and remarkably prolonged retention within tumor zzso zzso zzso treatment markedly retarded tumor growth in a zzso model of resistant human zzso zzso zzso analysis further indicated that increased in zzso efficacy of zzso zzso was associated with a higher degree of zzso stabilization, zzso arrest, zzso activity, and zzso of cell zzso These findings suggest that when the zzso was delivered as an zzso zzso the drug is better retained within the zzso cells than the free form of zzso These results indicated that the targeted zzso zzso may be promising in minimizing zzso related drug resistance and enhancing therapeutic efficacy compared with the free form of zzso
