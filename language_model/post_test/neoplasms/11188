The objectives of these population zzso analyses were to zzso assess the overall disposition of zzso zzso characterize zzso and zzso zzso and identify influential zzso with respect to zzso zzso and, zzso provide individual empirical zzso estimates of zzso parameters for use in a subsequent zzso evaluation of zzso following zzso zzso 

Data from zzso patients who received zzso cycles without zzso acid or vitamin B12 supplementation during participation in one of ten phase II cancer trials were evaluated by population zzso analysis using zzso Starting doses were 500 or 600 zzso zzso per zzso body surface area, administered as zzso intravenous infusions every 21 days (1 zzso The model was developed using data from eight of the ten zzso zzso performance was evaluated using data from the other two zzso 

The population zzso of zzso administered as a zzso intravenous infusion are well characterized by a zzso zzso Typical values of total systemic zzso central volume of distribution, zzso zzso and peripheral volume of distribution were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on these zzso estimates, the terminal elimination zzso of zzso was approximately zzso zzso Renal function was identified as a zzso with respect to total systemic zzso and body surface area as a zzso with respect to the central volume of zzso 

Total systemic exposure zzso for a given dose of zzso increases as zzso function zzso Since zzso analyses have shown that zzso and not C zzso is the primary zzso of zzso response to zzso this suggests that dose adjustments based on zzso function, rather than body surface area, might be considered for zzso
