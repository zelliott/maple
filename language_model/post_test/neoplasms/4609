The loss of zzso differentiation in zzso which is accompanied by higher mobility and zzso of the zzso cells, is often a consequence of reduced zzso zzso The primary cause of the zzso of cells in invasive zzso appears to be a zzso of the integrity of zzso zzso often involving the cell zzso zzso zzso Permanent and transient molecular mechanisms can lead to the impairment of junction integrity of zzso cells and thus to the progression of zzso towards a more invasive zzso These include zzso of zzso expression and interaction between the zzso junction protein zzso and the zzso zzso gene product zzso
