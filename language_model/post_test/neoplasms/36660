In developing and designing zzso the selection of the isotope is a major zzso This selection depends on a number of criteria and zzso affecting usefulness and zzso zzso is directly related to the zzso performance of the zzso radiation in relation to tissue and its zzso with a major distinction between the effects of alpha and zzso (or zzso zzso is also directly related to the zzso performance of the zzso zzso zzso complex, where the proper choice of isotope zzso zzso is of major zzso zzso depends on availability of the components in the zzso complex, and also on convenience and safety aspects in the preparation and the handling of the materials as well as in their application in zzso A comparison is made between the various properties of zzso zzso that have been proposed over a number of years, concluding that the combination zzso zzso deserves serious further zzso
