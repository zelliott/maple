This includes review of recent papers about clinical application of flow zzso referred to sensitivity and effectiveness of radiation therapy and also our study to develop the new method to detect the DNA damage by zzso In view point of zzso damage with radiation therapy, zzso showed usefulness in using forward scatter zzso The zzso induced to measure DNA damage here was originally developed by Cook et zzso and thereafter, by zzso who first applied zzso to detect the zzso The zzso from zzso cell and U 138 cell line were prepared following their zzso Control zzso showed a zzso reduction in the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso obtained after zzso showed a restricted reduction of zzso The zzso of the zzso reduction seems to be a zzso in radiation zzso This results indicate that zzso would be a useful tool for a rapid analysis of nuclear damage in near zzso Other zzso such as DNA index, DNA zzso were discussed from the recent zzso
