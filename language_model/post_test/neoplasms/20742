zzso zzso is a zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso with clinically promising zzso activity documented in various in zzso and in zzso tumor zzso The objectives of this Phase I study were to determine the maximum tolerated dose, evaluate toxic effects, and document any zzso activity of this novel zzso Using an zzso zzso mass zzso system, we also characterized the clinical zzso zzso and metabolism of zzso The maximum tolerated dose was reached at 300 zzso zzso the zzso zzso was documented in zzso of the patients treated at that dose zzso There were no episodes of zzso or severe anemia zzso zzso zzso and no major zzso toxicity was zzso zzso of tumor growth was observed in four patients, but no objective responses were zzso Whereas a zzso model described the zzso plasma zzso data reasonably well, a zzso model consistently performed zzso After a rapid distribution phase, zzso plasma levels declined with mean beta and gamma zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso plasma zzso was zzso The mean area under the zzso curve increased zzso as the dose was zzso but there was significant overlap between dose zzso The area under the zzso curve and the percentage of decline in zzso were zzso A single zzso zzso was detected in five zzso Unlike the in zzso studies of zzso the principal zzso detected was an zzso zzso confirmed by mass zzso In all five subjects, the concentration of this zzso never exceeded zzso of the simultaneously measured parent drug zzso The available zzso zzso and clinical data suggest that further study of escalated zzso dosing with zzso support is zzso
