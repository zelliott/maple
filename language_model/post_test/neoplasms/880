zzso zzso is becoming a powerful method in cancer class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has shown advantages over other conventional zzso zzso Nonetheless, there is still considerable room for improving the performance of zzso To this end, in this paper, gene selection and explicitly enforcing zzso are introduced into the zzso zzso zzso independent component analysis is employed to select a subset of genes so that the effect of irrelevant or noisy genes can be zzso The zzso and its zzso sparse zzso and zzso with zzso zzso are then used for tumor zzso on the selected zzso A series of elaborate experiments are performed by varying the number of clusters and the number of selected genes to evaluate the cooperation between different gene selection settings and zzso zzso Finally, the experiments on three representative gene expression zzso demonstrated that the proposed scheme can achieve better zzso zzso
