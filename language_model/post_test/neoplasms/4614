The toxicity associated with conventional cancer chemotherapy is primarily due to a lack of specificity for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso injected zzso spores exhibit a remarkable specificity for zzso This is because, following their administration, zzso spores become exclusively zzso to, and zzso in, the zzso tissue of zzso This unique property could be exploited to deliver therapeutic agents to zzso In particular, genetic engineering could be used to zzso a suitable zzso host with the capacity to produce an zzso within the zzso which can zzso a zzso introduced, zzso zzso into a toxic zzso The feasibility of this strategy zzso zzso zzso therapy, zzso has been demonstrated by cloning the zzso coli B gene zzso zzso (an zzso which converts the zzso zzso to a highly toxic zzso zzso zzso into a zzso expression zzso and introducing the zzso zzso into zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene was efficiently zzso with zzso zzso representing zzso of the cell soluble zzso Following the intravenous injection of the zzso spores into mice, zzso zzso have been zzso by Western zzso to contain the zzso zzso zzso
