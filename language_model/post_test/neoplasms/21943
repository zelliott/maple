zzso toxicity of zzso may be reduced and therapeutic efficacy may be improved by zzso sampling and dose adjustment to achieve a target area under the curve zzso for two of its zzso zzso zzso and zzso mustard zzso To facilitate real-time dose adjustment, we developed zzso code within the statistical software R that incorporates individual data into a population zzso zzso 

zzso prediction performance was compared to that obtained with zzso zzso modeling using zzso in 20 cancer patients receiving zzso zzso zzso of individual zzso parameters was accomplished from limited zzso five samples over zzso zzso sampling of plasma zzso and zzso after the initial zzso zzso zzso on individual zzso simulations of the zzso of both zzso and zzso were provided for a range of second doses zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results compared favorably with zzso and returned accurate predictions for zzso of zzso and zzso with comparable mean absolute prediction error and root mean square prediction zzso With our method, the mean absolute prediction error and root mean square prediction error of zzso zzso were zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

We developed dose adjustment software that potentially can be used to adjust zzso dosing in a clinical setting, thus expanding the opportunity for zzso zzso of zzso The software is simple to use zzso no programming zzso reads individual patient data directly from an Excel zzso and runs in less than 5 minutes on a zzso zzso
