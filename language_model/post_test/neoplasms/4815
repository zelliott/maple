Little is known about the presentation of multiple concurrent symptoms zzso zzso in long-term cancer survivors, with few studies adequately powered to compare quality of life zzso and symptom presentation by cancer zzso 

This research aimed to 1) assess zzso zzso and 2) identify clusters of zzso physical symptoms by cancer type among long-term breast, zzso zzso and melanoma cancer zzso 

A zzso zzso sample of zzso adult cancer survivors five to six years zzso completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life zzso zzso zzso assessing global zzso and frequency of presentation of zzso physical zzso 

zzso survivors reported higher levels of global zzso than 1) the general population zzso zzso zzso zzso small clinical zzso and 2) cancer patients early in the care trajectory zzso zzso zzso zzso moderate clinical zzso The majority zzso did not report any zzso physical zzso zzso reported multiple zzso or more) symptoms in the past zzso Factor analysis found that cognitive zzso fatigue, insomnia, pain, zzso appetite loss, zzso zzso zzso and vomiting formed a cluster zzso No symptom clusters were identified that were specific to just one cancer zzso However, individual symptoms (including zzso pain, zzso and zzso modestly zzso between cancer zzso 

zzso to expectations, no symptom clusters specific to one type of cancer were identified and survivors reported few zzso symptoms and high zzso These results convey a strong zzso zzso message, providing health professionals with a sound foundation for making encouraging predictions about their patients' long-term physical recovery after zzso Cancer patients also will welcome the news that only a minority of five-year survivors experience long-term and late zzso
