We assessed the diagnostic utility of measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with free zzso or total zzso calcium in four groups of zzso zzso 91 patients with zzso proven primary zzso zzso seven patients without zzso evidence of zzso zzso 70 patients with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso 28 similar patients without zzso In patients in Group 1, the use of either calcium measurement along with zzso increased diagnostic accuracy from 95 to zzso In Group 2, values consistent with primary zzso were obtained for zzso of samples with zzso zzso alone, zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso Surprisingly, zzso of samples from both zzso groups (3 and 4) had zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso and zzso zzso 3) the following percentages were classified as possibly being zzso zzso with zzso zzso alone; zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso Our data indicate that zzso about a fourth of patients with zzso zzso also have evidence of zzso as judged by this (and probably all zzso zzso methods based on zzso zzso specificity and that zzso measuring zzso and zzso rather than zzso and zzso gives a small increase in diagnostic zzso
