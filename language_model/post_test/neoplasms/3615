Because the discovery of a link between mismatch repair zzso and sporadic or inherited human zzso characterized by zzso instability zzso zzso genes containing coding repeat sequences have been found to be zzso at these repeats in zzso tumors from different primary sites as reported in the present zzso zzso of such zzso appears to be the main molecular mechanism by which zzso cells accumulate functional changes with putative zzso zzso These zzso occur in many genes at variable zzso They can affect genes with a putative role in human zzso involved in different or similar pathways and are thus thought to be zzso or zzso events selected for in these zzso in a zzso or dominant zzso However, because of the high level of instability characterizing these zzso they are also likely to occur in genes without any expected role in zzso zzso In light of these recent data, the concept of target genes for instability and their possible role in zzso zzso is reconsidered zzso
