zzso of optimal clinical target volume zzso margins around gross zzso volume zzso for modern zzso techniques, requiring more precise target zzso is controversial and zzso zzso zzso has been greatly improved using molecular imaging integrated with conventional imaging zzso However, the exact zzso and extent of microscopic disease, to be zzso by zzso cannot be zzso by any techniques developed to date and remain zzso As a result, the zzso is generally determined by clinicians based on their experience and patients' zzso zzso In this article we review zzso studies addressing the extent of zzso disease and its possible correlation with zzso characteristics in various zzso zzso The data have been tabulated to facilitate a comparison between proposed margins by different investigations and with current margins generally accepted for each zzso zzso It is concluded that there is a need for further studies to reach a consensus on the optimal zzso pertaining to each zzso zzso
