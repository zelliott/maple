Analysis using the public zzso database Gene zzso zzso indicates significantly higher zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cancer and high grade zzso but not in zzso zzso compared to normal zzso Human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells expressed relatively higher levels of zzso and zzso compared to zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso Administration of zzso zzso induced cell growth in a zzso fashion in zzso and zzso cells but not in zzso and zzso cancer zzso The blockade of zzso inhibited cell survival only in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results collectively suggest the role of zzso zzso signaling in various cancer cells and provide a basis for the variable clinical responses to zzso therapy observed in different types of zzso
