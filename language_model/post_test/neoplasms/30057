The zzso zzso has long been the Portuguese region that presents the highest mortality rates for certain zzso Lack of zzso data has prevented the evaluation of the actual burden of this disease in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 5th zzso zzso initially diagnosed between the January 1st 2000 and December 31st 2002 were retrieved from the database of the recently established zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso rates were calculated and confidence intervals were estimated using zzso zzso Relative risks of developing cancer in the zzso when compared to mainland zzso have been represented by standardized zzso Quality zzso including zzso zzso ratios, were also zzso 

Overall, the data shows a high zzso rate for some zzso diseases, specifically in zzso Compared to those living in mainland zzso both zzso men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and women zzso zzso presented a significantly higher risk of developing cancer, all sites zzso When compared with other cancer zzso a less zzso cancer survival pattern is reported in the zzso as emphasized by higher zzso ratios for several cancer zzso 

A preliminary analysis of the results suggests the presence of some major risk factors in the zzso population, namely tobacco smoking in zzso Higher zzso ratios would also point to survival disparities between the zzso zzso and the continent, which should be further zzso
