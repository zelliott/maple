zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly expressed in human cancer cells and regulate cell signals zzso via membrane zzso Generally, zzso zzso enhance tumor zzso while zzso zzso suppress zzso In particular, zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed in zzso and small cell lung cancer cells, and their expression cause increased cell growth and zzso In zzso expression of zzso and zzso also enhanced cell invasion and zzso and caused increased zzso of focal zzso zzso and zzso In addition to focal zzso zzso Lyn zzso was also activated by zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso In contrast with melanoma cells, zzso showed reduced cell zzso with increased zzso of zzso Thus, increased expression of zzso caused enhanced zzso of signaling zzso leading to distinct zzso between zzso and zzso zzso increased and decreased zzso zzso Thus, whole features of zzso zzso formed in the individual cancer types seem to determine the main signaling zzso and biological zzso
