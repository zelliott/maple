zzso zzso has been used as a powerful tool to discover genes involved in zzso through a technique called Common zzso Site zzso analysis where tumors are induced by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso are zzso A fundamental assumption made in this analysis is that multiple zzso insertions in close proximity occurring more frequently than would be predicted randomly provides evidence that the genes near the zzso are involved in the formation of the zzso We demonstrate here using data derived from zzso zzso not put under selection for tumor induction that zzso analysis as currently defined is often not a sufficient argument for a zzso significance in zzso
