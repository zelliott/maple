The aim of the present review is to provide insights into the future therapeutic approaches to zzso muscle wasting that flow from the progressive knowledge of mechanisms regulating muscle mass in health and zzso 

Cancer zzso is a severely debilitating and life-threatening zzso syndrome accounting for approximately zzso of cancer zzso The prominent clinical feature of cancer zzso is the progressive loss of muscle mass, which is substantially not zzso with any of the currently available zzso zzso or pharmacological zzso Cancer zzso has long been considered a late event in the natural history of cancer patients, thus zzso them to merely zzso zzso The accumulating evidence that the zzso and molecular zzso ultimately leading to muscle wasting are operating early after zzso zzso even when weight loss is minimal or zzso is strengthening the view that cancer zzso should be considered an early zzso 

Currently, despite scientific and economic efforts, the therapy of zzso muscle wasting has a poor success zzso Present knowledge of the zzso mechanisms involved in muscle zzso is prompting continuous research aimed at developing more effective and selective therapeutic tools for the prevention and treatment of muscle loss in zzso
