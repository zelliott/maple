Cancer epidemiology has undergone marked development since the zzso One of the most spectacular and specific contributions was the demonstration of the massive effect of smoking on the occurrence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Major chemical, physical, and biological zzso agents have been identified in the working environment and in the overall zzso The chain of events from environmental zzso to cancer requires hundreds of zzso genes coding for proteins involved in the transport and metabolism of zzso or in repair, or in an immune or inflammatory zzso The zzso and zzso characteristics of cancer create the theoretical conditions for statistical interactions that have been exceptionally zzso Over the last two decades, a considerable mass of data has been generated, mostly addressing the interactions between smoking and zzso zzso in zzso zzso They were sometimes considered disappointing, but they actually brought a lot of information and raised many zzso zzso In zzso the number of zzso that can be considered candidate per function increased so much that multiple testing has become a major issue, and zzso zzso approaches have more and more gained in zzso Facing the resulting complexity, some instruments are being set zzso our studies are now equipped with carefully sampled biological collections, zzso zzso systems are becoming available, work on statistical zzso is zzso zzso databases are growing larger and access to them is becoming zzso international consortiums are being zzso The roles of environmental and genetic factors are being jointly zzso The basic rules of zzso which are demanding with respect to zzso with respect to the zzso and molecular criteria for cancer zzso with respect to the evaluation of environmental zzso their zzso zzso and zzso with respect to study size and with respect to the rigor of zzso zzso are more pertinent than ever zzso
