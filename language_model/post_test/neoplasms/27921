zzso of the short arm of zzso 9 with a minimum region of overlap at band zzso are frequently observed in acute zzso leukemia and in zzso They also occur at a lower frequency in zzso zzso lung zzso and other solid zzso These deletions often include the entire zzso zzso gene zzso which comprises about 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso By comparing microscopic deletions with the genes lost at the molecular level, we have determined the order of these genes on zzso to be zzso zzso In a few cell lines and in primary leukemia cells, we have observed deletions that have zzso within the zzso gene cluster and result in partial loss of the zzso zzso These partial deletions allowed us to determine the order of some genes or groups of genes within the zzso gene zzso Our current results map the shortest region of overlap of these deletions in the various tumors to the region between the zzso end of the zzso gene cluster and the zzso gene zzso
