zzso are under extensive investigation as targets for drug zzso zzso novel zzso whose zzso zzso zzso zzso would be of zzso Recent advances in zzso interference have enabled the realization of this zzso 

We screened zzso short hairpin zzso clones targeting the human zzso to detect human zzso on which cancer cells are more dependent than normal zzso We employed a zzso screening strategy using human zzso cell lines and human zzso zzso cell lines, and found that short hairpin zzso targeting zzso a clock gene that regulates zzso zzso can induce selective growth zzso in engineered tumor zzso Analysis of zzso data revealed that zzso is zzso in several cancer tissue samples examined compared to zzso normal zzso suggesting a positive role of zzso in zzso or zzso Treatment with zzso a zzso domain inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein product of zzso showed a similar degree of zzso growth zzso In a search for zzso of zzso that mediate zzso growth zzso we discovered that knocking down zzso another clock gene involved in zzso rhythm control, zzso zzso growth zzso 

We identified zzso as a potential target for developing zzso zzso with a high therapeutic zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso clock genes can control the cell cycle and cell survival zzso and emphasize a central role of zzso and zzso in linking these zzso
