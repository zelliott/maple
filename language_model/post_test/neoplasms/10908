zzso by our recent finding that the nuclear zzso index is significantly increased in zzso cells and zzso normal cells in clinical zzso specimens derived from cancer patients, we sought to identify potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed zzso The cell cycle is an ordered series of events that describes the intervals of cell growth, DNA zzso and zzso that zzso cell zzso Since abnormal cell cycles and increased proliferation are characteristic of many human cancer cells, we hypothesized that the observed increase in nuclear zzso index could be related to an abundance or zzso of cells derived from cancer patients at a specific point or zzso of the cell zzso Here we show that changes in nuclear zzso index of fixed cells are seen as synchronized populations of cells that proceed through the cell cycle, and that increased nuclear zzso index is strongly correlated with increased DNA zzso We therefore propose that an abundance of cells undergoing DNA replication and zzso may explain the increase in nuclear zzso index observed in both zzso and zzso normal cells from cancer zzso Our findings suggest that nuclear zzso index may be a novel physical zzso for early cancer detection and risk zzso
