zzso regrowth of zzso tumors following zzso dormancy represents a major clinical challenge for treatment of zzso zzso We reported previously that zzso prostate tumors, which underwent complete zzso zzso followed by aggressive zzso could be cured with a zzso zzso virus zzso zzso library derived from zzso tumor zzso By screening the zzso zzso zzso library, here we identify zzso zzso as a zzso tumor zzso against which tolerance can be zzso zzso zzso in two different types of tumor zzso and zzso which had evaded two different frontline treatments zzso or zzso significantly zzso zzso compared with their primary tumor counterparts, which zzso a novel sensitivity to zzso zzso chemotherapy upon the zzso zzso This was exploited in zzso using combination therapies to cure mice, which would otherwise have zzso after zzso primary therapy in both zzso Our data show that zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso distinct zzso compared with the primary tumor which can be identified using the zzso library zzso These results suggest that it may be possible to design a few common zzso therapies against a variety of tumor zzso in some cases using agents with no obvious activity against the primary zzso
