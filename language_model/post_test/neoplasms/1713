zzso zzso density zzso has recently been shown to be a valuable zzso tool in many zzso Yet, zzso does not take into account the spatial arrangement of the vessels, therefore only partly reflecting the zzso zzso In order to describe contextual vascular relationships more accurately, we have used zzso and zzso structure analysis zzso based on zzso image processing to zzso zzso hot zzso 

The zzso performance in prediction of patients' outcome was evaluated by zzso analysis and compared with manually obtained zzso whereas an automated zzso zzso zzso searched most zzso zzso zzso The method is based on analysis of vascular zzso of zzso tissue sections of invasive cervical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

For all three zzso prediction of prognosis based on zzso yielded in general much higher recognition scores compared with zzso or zzso zzso Survival of cervical zzso was mostly correlated with clinical data, with the vascular zzso being the only zzso with independent zzso zzso of zzso zzso is best described by zzso completed with zzso indicating an inverse correlation of survival time with a more irregular pattern and a slight increase in vessel zzso For zzso we found a strong correlation with zzso and patients' outcome, with two zzso having independent zzso zzso 

The more accurate zzso description obtained with zzso may be useful for further exploitation as a zzso in a general diagnostic pathology zzso
