zzso cells are present in some solid zzso and are known to limit zzso To compare two measures of zzso zzso 25 patients with locally advanced disease and accessible zzso or zzso zzso were examined using an oxygen zzso and the alkaline comet zzso 

For the comet zzso fine needle zzso zzso were taken immediately following a dose of zzso zzso Single cells were examined for zzso DNA strand breaks, and the percentage of zzso hypoxic cells within the population was calculated from DNA damage zzso For oxygen tension zzso zzso multiple tracks were made using an zzso oxygen zzso The possibility that application of the first method might influence hypoxic fraction measurement by the second method was examined in a more controlled system by creating four tracks in zzso zzso zzso using an oxygen zzso and measuring hypoxic fraction at subsequent zzso 

For 28 zzso from 25 patients, hypoxic fraction measured by comet zzso correlated with the percentage of zzso values zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mean comet hypoxic fraction was zzso for five zzso with a median zzso zzso 10 zzso For the remaining 23 zzso with a median zzso zzso 10 zzso the mean hypoxic fraction was zzso Advancement of an oxygen zzso through zzso zzso had no significant effect on hypoxic fraction measured 5 zzso to 24 h later using the alkaline comet zzso 

zzso defined as hypoxic based on a median zzso zzso 10 zzso appear to contain more than zzso zzso hypoxic cells as estimated by the comet zzso In an animal zzso model, puncture of the zzso with an oxygen zzso did not influence hypoxic fraction measured using the comet zzso in agreement with the clinical data that the order in which the two methods were performed was not zzso
