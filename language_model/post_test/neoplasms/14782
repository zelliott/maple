zzso of zzso zzso and trans zzso complexes with one zzso and one aromatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in which the aromatic group was replaced by the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in almost complete zzso of the zzso and the zzso had a effect on the biological activities of the zzso and trans zzso similar to that previously reported for aromatic zzso as is exemplified by them having similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Observation of zzso following treatment of the zzso complex with zzso zzso or zzso suggests zzso and subsequent loss of the putative zzso group zzso No such effect was observed for the trans complex which does not experience trans zzso zzso zzso of cells that had been treated with the complexes gave rise to zzso fluorescence, suggesting zzso displacement for both zzso The zzso appears to be zzso in the zzso or late zzso These complexes are excellent models of zzso of zzso zzso and trans complexes with aromatic zzso zzso and can be used to study the metabolism of the zzso group zzso
