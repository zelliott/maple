zzso that regulate the transition of zzso from clinically zzso and dormant to progressively growing are the least understood aspects of cancer zzso Here, we show that a large ( approximately zzso reduction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level in human zzso zzso cells, while not affecting their in zzso growth, induced a protracted state of tumor dormancy in zzso with zzso zzso We have now identified the mechanism responsible for the induction of zzso We found that zzso proteins were physically associated with zzso and that in cells with low zzso the frequency of this association was significantly reduced, leading to a reduced zzso of zzso and a lower zzso of cells to the zzso zzso zzso to zzso resulted in a robust and persistent zzso zzso and zzso growth stimulation of only zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso cells, the zzso level of active zzso regulated zzso zzso was four to zzso reduced in zzso dormant cells and its stimulation by single chain zzso zzso was weak and showed slow zzso The high zzso level of active zzso in zzso cells could be strongly and rapidly zzso by zzso zzso of zzso complexes in zzso cells with zzso or a zzso that zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that dormancy of low zzso cells may be the consequence of insufficient zzso complexes, which cannot induce zzso activity above a threshold needed to sustain tumor growth in zzso In support of this conclusion we found that treatment of zzso cells, which maintain high zzso activity in zzso with zzso interfering with the zzso signal to zzso zzso mimic the in zzso dormancy induced by zzso of zzso
