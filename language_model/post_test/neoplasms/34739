Two zzso zzso zzso 4 and zzso 1, were characterized in zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and were compared as zzso zzso for their in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso 1) were characterized in zzso for their binding properties with zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, and human prostate cancer zzso Their ability to zzso calcium zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells was analyzed as well as their ability to trigger zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, as determined zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, their zzso properties as zzso zzso were tested in zzso in both cell zzso Finally, their zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso zzso 

A comparable binding affinity with the 50% zzso concentration zzso in the zzso range was measured for zzso 4 and zzso 1 in all tested zzso zzso 4 behaved as an zzso by strongly stimulating calcium zzso and by triggering zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 was ineffective in stimulating calcium zzso and in triggering zzso zzso zzso However, in these zzso it behaved as a competitive zzso as it reversed completely the zzso effects in both zzso zzso zzso 1 was only zzso taken up by zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso respectively, of total added zzso compared with zzso zzso 4 zzso of total added zzso in both cell zzso zzso the zzso study revealed a much more pronounced zzso at 1, 4, and 24 h after injection of zzso zzso 1 in zzso into zzso tumors than zzso zzso zzso In zzso competition experiments demonstrated a specific zzso in zzso tumors and in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratios were zzso for zzso 4 and zzso for zzso 1 at 4 zzso 

This comparative in zzso zzso study with zzso 1 and zzso 4 indicates that zzso zzso zzso may be superior targeting agents to zzso zzso zzso suggesting a change of paradigm in the field of zzso zzso
