The zzso system is the major machinery in the cell for specific zzso zzso zzso of a protein via the zzso zzso involves two successive steps: zzso zzso attachment of multiple zzso molecules to the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso protein by the zzso zzso zzso Via targeting of many zzso the system regulates a broad array of basic cellular processes such as cell cycle, differentiation and signal zzso zzso it is not surprising that aberrations in the system zzso the zzso of many human diseases, among them zzso neurodegenerative diseases and many disorders of the immune and inflammatory zzso In some zzso the involvement of the system is zzso whereas in others the zzso linkage is less zzso It is expected that the ongoing extensive research in this area will shed light on the underlying zzso mechanisms of the zzso zzso diseases, and will lead to the development of zzso therapeutic zzso
