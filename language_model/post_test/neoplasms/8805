The lack of individual socioeconomic status zzso information in cancer registry data zzso the use of zzso measures to investigate health zzso Concerns about zzso however, prohibit publishing patients' residential locations at the zzso zzso We developed a census zzso composite zzso index to be released in place of individual census tracts to minimize the risk of zzso 

Two zzso zzso based on the measures identified in the literature were constructed using factor zzso The analyses were repeated using the data from the 2000 zzso census and zzso American Community zzso to create the zzso at two time points, which were linked to zzso zzso zzso and End zzso registry data to estimate zzso and survival zzso 

The two zzso performed similarly in zzso census tracts and detecting socioeconomic zzso in cancer zzso and zzso The zzso in the zzso is positive for breast and zzso and negative for lung zzso in all races, although the level zzso The positive zzso in survival is more salient for zzso breast, zzso and lung zzso 

The census zzso zzso index provides a valuable tool for monitoring the disparities in cancer burdens while avoiding potential identity zzso This index, divided into zzso and zzso is now available to the researchers on zzso
