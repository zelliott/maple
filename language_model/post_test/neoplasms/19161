zzso cell lines exposed to zzso specific for cell surface zzso developed increased cellular incorporation of zzso and zzso (up to zzso increases over cells treated with normal rabbit zzso zzso cells multiplied more rapidly and lived longer than control cells in tissue zzso These observations were made both with cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso against zzso and with several cell lines and their respective zzso zzso zzso that were zzso at low zzso were zzso at high zzso These observations may have significance in regard to enhancing effects of zzso on tumor cell growth in zzso
