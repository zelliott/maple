This study was designed to evaluate and characterize the molecular basis of zzso activity of naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso The compounds were isolated from plants in previous studies and characterized zzso The zzso activities of 31 zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were evaluated using zzso zzso and validated on a zzso zzso Several zzso and a zzso zzso induced tumor cell zzso or growth arrest of several tumor cell lines with zzso values zzso zzso significantly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso B zzso as an example, we showed that the compound induced zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in cells with zzso zzso but not in those with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells rescued cell death zzso In zzso the zzso was activated and critical for zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso in zzso deficient cells was sufficient to drive cells into zzso via the zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso inhibited tumor growth on nude zzso zzso occurring zzso and zzso zzso are potent zzso zzso Those compounds exert zzso effect through zzso induction of zzso or zzso
