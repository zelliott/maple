Studies using genetically modified mice have revealed fundamental functions of the zzso factor zzso in bone biology, zzso and zzso However, the biological role of the zzso protein zzso is not well defined in zzso Here we report an unexpected zzso function of zzso in transgenic mice, in which zzso expression of zzso in various zzso resulted in generalized zzso with zzso manifestation in the zzso The pulmonary zzso was characterized by vascular zzso and obliteration of pulmonary zzso which coincided with expression of zzso an zzso target gene involved in vascular zzso and zzso These zzso were followed by zzso release of zzso factors, such as zzso zzso growth factor 1, and zzso progressive zzso and premature zzso zzso experiments and bone zzso zzso suggested that zzso developed independently of B and T cells and was not zzso by zzso despite the marked inflammation observed in transgenic zzso zzso strong expression of zzso was also observed in human samples of idiopathic and zzso pulmonary zzso These findings indicate that zzso expression is sufficient to cause pulmonary zzso in mice, possibly by linking vascular zzso and zzso and suggest that zzso has to be considered a contributing zzso factor of pulmonary zzso in zzso
