zzso stress represents a deregulation of the zzso between the zzso oxygen species and the mechanisms of zzso and zzso By analyzing the level of zzso damaged DNA bases and zzso in urine we can assess the extent of DNA repair within the whole zzso High levels of markers of zzso DNA damage zzso in the urine indicate elevated levels of zzso stress, but can also reflect a high level of efficiency of the processes that work to repair this damage zzso stress can be high and the repair processes eliminate its zzso In the present review we discuss the role of zzso stress, zzso DNA damage repair mechanisms, potential sources of zzso and zzso zzso markers of zzso zzso content in zzso effect of zzso supplementation on the levels of zzso DNA zzso potential application of zzso DNA damage determination in clinical zzso
