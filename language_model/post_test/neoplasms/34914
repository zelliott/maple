zzso poorly differentiated zzso often represent diagnostic difficulties in surgical zzso zzso the expression of zzso of different molecular weights zzso 57, and 66 zzso were compared in zzso sections of 37 primary zzso with their zzso zzso zzso by an zzso complex (ABC) method, using zzso zzso The zzso tumors consisted of 16 zzso cell zzso zzso and 17 zzso with different degrees of differentiation zzso zzso or poorly zzso a zzso cell zzso a zzso zzso a transitional cell zzso of the zzso and a zzso tumor of the zzso The primary and zzso tumors showed the same zzso zzso All zzso and their zzso were positive for zzso zzso and negative for zzso zzso All zzso and their zzso were positive for zzso zzso and negative for zzso zzso The extent of reactions varied with the differentiation of the zzso with zzso tumors showing more diffuse zzso Cases of lymphoma, zzso and melanoma were negative for the three types of zzso The results indicate that identification of different molecular weight zzso may be used to distinguish poorly differentiated zzso from poorly differentiated zzso even in zzso zzso In addition, demonstration of these zzso is useful in zzso presence and identity of small zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
