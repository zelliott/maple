In the past 10 years research on zzso has demonstrated their central role in regulating gene expression both in normal and diseased zzso The expression of zzso is widely altered in cancer, leading to abnormal expression of the genes regulated by these zzso and subsequently zzso in entire molecular networks and zzso One especially interesting zzso zzso is zzso which is frequently altered in a large variety of zzso The functional role of zzso is extremely complex and zzso can hold both tumor zzso and zzso roles in different tumor zzso The zzso caused by zzso zzso expression seems to be strongly dependent on the zzso expression zzso For example, in breast cancer loss of zzso expression is associated with high risk of zzso whereas in zzso cancer high zzso expression zzso with advanced disease zzso This review summarizes the complex expression patterns of zzso in human zzso describes the variable zzso caused by altered zzso zzso and highlights the current knowledge on the genes targeted by zzso
