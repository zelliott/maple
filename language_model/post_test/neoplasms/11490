The primary aim of the present study was to examine the relationship of changes in zzso levels following zzso human zzso zzso treatment to changes in cognitive functioning studied by Mini Mental State zzso zzso in elderly cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy zzso The secondary aim was that to assess the relationship of changes in zzso levels following zzso treatment to changes in functions studied by Comprehensive zzso Assessment zzso such as zzso of Daily Living zzso zzso zzso of Daily Living zzso Geriatric Depression zzso zzso and the Mini zzso Assessment zzso To this end, zzso levels and cognitive functioning were evaluated in a sample of cancer patients prior to the start of chemotherapy treatment and again after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment with chemotherapy plus zzso Ten elderly patients zzso age zzso zzso were zzso At zzso enrolled patients had a mean zzso value of zzso After 4 weeks of zzso treatment, zzso values increased significantly zzso with a mean increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 out of 10 zzso showed an increase of zzso levels zzso in comparison to baseline and therefore were considered zzso At zzso four patients zzso showed a moderate cognitive zzso whilst six patients zzso showed a normal cognitive zzso After 4 weeks of zzso treatment nine patients zzso showed a significant improvement of cognitive functions in comparison to baseline zzso eight of them were zzso also to zzso in terms of correction of zzso The zzso rank correlation test showed a statistical significant correlation between zzso increase and increase in cognitive functioning assessed by zzso after 4 weeks zzso 8 weeks zzso and 12 weeks zzso of zzso zzso zzso the findings of this study provide support for the hypothesis that significant increases in zzso over the course of chemotherapy supplemented with zzso administration would be accompanied by significant improvement in cognitive performance over the same zzso
