The correct diagnosis of tumor zzso and its differentiation from benign zzso can change patient management and prevent unnecessary zzso zzso This study was aimed at evaluating the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the diagnosis of tumor zzso and its differentiation from benign zzso 

We conducted a retrospective review of zzso zzso scans of patients who underwent the study for zzso of a known zzso and had zzso zzso zzso standardized zzso value zzso zzso of the zzso zzso max of tumor (if zzso and zzso max of zzso blood pool were zzso zzso results were confirmed with clinical zzso structural imaging, and zzso when zzso 

A total of 24 patients (15 male and nine zzso with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso were zzso On the basis of structural imaging and clinical zzso 10 patients had benign and 14 patients had tumor zzso On zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was linear in 18 patients and focal in six zzso The most common site of zzso was the inferior zzso zzso The mean zzso max was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the benign zzso group and was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tumor zzso zzso The difference in zzso max was significant zzso On receiver operating characteristic analysis, a zzso zzso max of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was obtained to differentiate tumor zzso from benign zzso In six patients, zzso zzso detected zzso vascular zzso 

zzso zzso can detect active tumor zzso and is helpful in zzso it from benign zzso
