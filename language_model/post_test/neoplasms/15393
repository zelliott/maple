A series of zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells was established to survive in zzso increasing zzso of zzso These zzso cells contained amplified zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso against the zzso we present here results showing that the levels of zzso and its zzso and zzso did not correlate with those of drug zzso Our results suggest that overproduction of the zzso cannot account for the differences in drug resistance in these zzso cells, and that multiple zzso are involved in multiple drug resistance in zzso zzso
