To investigate zzso zzso rate at eight zzso zzso in 24 Danish families, where one parent is the zzso of childhood or adolescent cancer treated with zzso 

Parents and offspring were zzso for eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by Southern zzso 

Seven paternal zzso were observed for 130 zzso zzso in 18 offspring from 11 zzso fathers zzso zzso dose for offspring zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to six zzso for 146 zzso zzso in 21 offspring from 13 zzso zzso No statistically significant difference between the total paternal zzso rates was observed zzso for exposed fathers and zzso for zzso zzso Three maternal zzso were observed for 148 zzso zzso in 21 offspring from 13 zzso mothers zzso zzso dose for offspring zzso zzso range zzso zzso compared to one zzso for 130 zzso zzso in 18 offspring from 11 zzso zzso Again, no statistically significant difference was observed between the total maternal zzso rates zzso for exposed mothers and zzso for zzso zzso 

The data from this pilot study demonstrate no statistically significant increase in zzso zzso zzso rate associated with zzso for childhood and adolescent zzso
