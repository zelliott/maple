The paper discusses the unifying concept that cell zzso is the primary factor in the mechanism of zzso The concept includes the following zzso zzso Increased cell zzso causes cancer not only by promoting cell division and zzso zzso but also by zzso genes inducing cell zzso and by preventing zzso zzso factors that reduce cell zzso prevent cancer by zzso cell division and zzso zzso while zzso genes inducing cell zzso and by promoting zzso The unique ability of cell zzso to have these opposite effects on cell behavior and gene expression can account for its zzso role as the primary factor in both the promotion and prevention of zzso zzso A progressive increase in cell zzso induced by successive zzso and/or zzso changes, is the basic mechanism of zzso zzso the degree of zzso increasing with the degree of cell zzso zzso The increased zzso of cancer cells zzso their zzso rate, thereby enhancing their ability to compete for nutrients with their normal zzso This effect may play a major role in promoting tumor growth and in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso Increased cell zzso is also proposed as an alternative or additional explanation of the zzso effect of inflammatory agents and of zzso A survey of the literature provides evidence consistent with these zzso but suggestions are included for further investigations to test their zzso and their zzso From a clinical perspective, the zzso high water content of cancer cells permits the use of zzso technology for tumor detection and zzso Also of considerable therapeutic significance is the increased sensitivity if cancer cells to zzso zzso to result from genetic changes induced by increased zzso This may well be the zzso heel of cancer, and recent investigations indicate that it may be exploited very effectively in the treatment of the zzso In conclusion, I suggest that the need for studies on the molecular biology of cancer to be supplemented by more information on environmental effects on gene expression and on the zzso and zzso factors that mediate genetic effects at the cellular zzso This approach might also be used to assess the zzso of the zzso role of cell zzso as a factor of particular zzso
