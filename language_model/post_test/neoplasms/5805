In less than ten years, the study of inherited conditions zzso to cancer led to major discoveries on the basic mechanisms of zzso Those investigations have permitted to discover a new class of cancer genes now named zzso genes (or zzso and to demonstrate their implication in the majority of cancer including the sporadic zzso Those studies have indicated that familial forms of cancer can also result from zzso of a set of genes controlling zzso zzso In clinical practice, the identification of the molecular basis of major forms of inherited predisposition to cancer, has allowed to better define those cancer zzso As a consequence, it is now possible to propose to the at risk individuals, and their families, screening protocols based on precise estimate of their genetic zzso
