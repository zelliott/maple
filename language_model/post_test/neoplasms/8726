Among several recently developed zzso methods, zzso analysis is a highly sensitive method for the detection and measurement of zzso zzso zzso and other DNA zzso Since the method does not require radioactive zzso it is suitable for DNA of humans exposed to environmental or occupational zzso The basic procedure zzso the zzso incorporation of zzso into zzso or zzso zzso products of DNA, followed by zzso mapping and zzso of the zzso zzso products and zzso by zzso zzso zzso amounts of DNA are zzso thus the zzso is well suited for limited amounts of cells or zzso Various versions of the zzso afford different sensitivities of zzso zzso Under optimal conditions, one aromatic or zzso zzso in zzso zzso can be detected and measured zzso to zzso zzso zzso DNA or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has been successfully applied to a variety of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso In humans, the zzso zzso has been applied to DNA specimens from cigarette smokers, iron zzso workers, and zzso oven zzso zzso of total aromatic zzso levels in exposed individuals gave values of 1 zzso in zzso DNA zzso These values are similar to the total levels of persistent zzso in zzso of animals after exposure to initiating or zzso doses of authentic aromatic zzso Among the zzso zzso investigated are zzso zzso zzso zzso diet, carbon zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso DNA modifications zzso are being detected by zzso in animals that have not been knowingly exposed to zzso zzso profiles and levels are dependent on species, zzso sex, and zzso zzso levels of zzso have been consistently noted in the target organ of zzso animals and in resulting zzso suggesting that zzso loss may play a role in zzso
