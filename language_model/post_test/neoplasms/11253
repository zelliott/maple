An zzso drug may improve zzso quality of life zzso partly because patients know their zzso level is zzso In the absence of any published studies on this topic, the authors investigated the association between knowledge of zzso levels and zzso zzso 

The study analyzed zzso zzso zzso data from five zzso clinical trials of zzso therapy in patients with zzso zzso Patients were asked whether they knew their zzso level and, if so, to report its zzso Patients zzso were grouped into three categories depending on the extent and accuracy of zzso level zzso zzso scale scores were compared between zzso 

Only zzso of patients reported knowing their zzso level at the end of the study; however, the value was accurate zzso 1 zzso in zzso of these zzso On five of the 11 zzso scales zzso there was a significant association between knowledge of zzso level and zzso zzso However, the magnitude of the mean difference between those who knew zzso those who did not know their zzso was generally below scale thresholds for minimally important zzso 

Patient knowledge of zzso level has a modest association with some aspects of zzso zzso The magnitude of this association, where it exists, would be unlikely to explain large group differences in zzso reports over time, even for patients who know their zzso zzso
