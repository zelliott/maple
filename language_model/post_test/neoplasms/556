zzso levels of proteins previously shown to be elevated zzso proteins zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso or depressed zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso in cancer patients were correlated with tumor extent, in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and quantitative delayed zzso zzso to zzso zzso in 147 zzso patients with zzso solid zzso either confined to the primary site or with regional spread zzso Compared to 58 normal controls, levels of the zzso were significantly zzso alpha 2 zzso and zzso depressed, and zzso levels unchanged in patients with either local or regional zzso In patients with normal zzso to zzso the zzso were higher and zzso was lower than in zzso in patients with impaired zzso to zzso zzso and alpha zzso zzso were higher and alpha 2 zzso and zzso lower than in patients with normal zzso to zzso zzso levels did not differ from zzso in any of the zzso zzso protein levels appeared to be more related to the immune status of the patient than to tumor zzso The levels of the three zzso correlated directly with each other but zzso with alpha 2 zzso and zzso levels of alpha 2 zzso and zzso correlated directly with each zzso zzso of zzso and alpha zzso zzso correlated zzso with zzso to zzso however, levels of alpha 2 zzso correlated directly with zzso to zzso and uniquely the levels of alpha 2 zzso and zzso to zzso both showed similar changes for each of the four quantitative levels of zzso to zzso measured in the cancer zzso The data show that the proteins zzso except for zzso correlate zzso zzso or directly zzso 2 zzso and zzso with in zzso and in zzso parameters of cellular zzso The results provide a rationale for attempts to improve depressed cellular immunity by lowering circulating levels of zzso as is being attempted in ongoing trials using zzso and assessing the effect of zzso alpha 2 zzso or zzso in patients with low levels of these zzso and depressed cellular zzso The correlations between serum zzso levels and in zzso and in zzso parameters of cellular immunity lend rationale to investigations of the interactions of serum zzso and blood cells having zzso function that determine the level of cellular immunity expressed in zzso
