zzso of an zzso zzso using beads as solid phase allows the detection of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso The beads are shown to be advantageous for the extraction of proteins in highly diluted zzso solutions thus replacing a need for concentration of the zzso The mean concentration of zzso in pooled zzso fluid zzso from 120 control persons was shown to be zzso zzso The mean of the zzso concentration zzso of zzso was zzso for normal blood zzso barrier function with a corresponding mean zzso zzso zzso of zzso From the ratio of these two zzso zzso zzso zzso and the corresponding biological variation we constructed the normal range of an evaluation zzso In the range of a blood zzso barrier dysfunction, the discrimination line between values with or without a local zzso synthesis in brain was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five out of zzso control persons and 29 out of 45 patients with a tumor zzso had zzso zzso The evaluation graph had a high significance with respect to the identification of tumor zzso from a group of patients with a confirmed zzso zzso 13 out of 13 and from a group of patients with zzso tumor zzso 10 out of 16 could be identified by zzso zzso The zzso zzso concentration zzso fits well in the concept of a molecular zzso filter function of the blood zzso zzso
