zzso zzso contrast agents are required for a large proportion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso media are indispensable to more clearly differentiate zzso structures and to detect and characterize zzso Depending on the indication up to 200 zzso of these agents are injected during zzso Despite these large amounts adverse effects are rare and have further decreased with the introduction of zzso zzso However, it took 10 to 20 years until these zzso agents replaced the older zzso agents in clinical zzso In recent years no new substance has been brought to the zzso The introduction of rapid scanning using zzso CT technology, however, has led to the development of more sophisticated contrast injection zzso Current research focuses on zzso contrast application techniques and on further evaluating the safety profiles of the various zzso The amount of contrast enhancement obtained in individual patients for instance depends on the contrast agent zzso such as zzso zzso and the parameters of the contrast injection zzso such as zzso flux and zzso zzso Meanwhile, contrast agent characteristics such as zzso and zzso play a role in the safety profile of an zzso This paper provides a current overview of CT contrast media, CT contrast zzso and CT contrast applications with a special focus on zzso zzso
