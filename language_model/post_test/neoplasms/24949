In recent years, we have witnessed critical advances in zzso and zzso which contributed to delineate the zzso progression zzso This includes the altered expression of genes and proteins not only in tumor cells, but also in zzso zzso zzso and immune zzso Adding more complexity to this bewildering information, efforts are being made to define the zzso zzso of the tumor zzso which results from the abnormal expression and activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The multiple zzso possibilities of zzso structures expressed by zzso versus normal tissue provide enormous potential for information display and expand potential therapeutic zzso The responsibility of deciphering the biological information zzso by the zzso zzso is partially zzso to distinct families of zzso zzso proteins or zzso whose expression and function are regulated in zzso zzso zzso a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso can control tumor progression by directly influencing tumor growth or by modulating cell migration, zzso and zzso zzso In this review, we will highlight recent findings on how zzso zzso control the dialogue between tumor and immune cells and how these interactions could be exploited for therapeutic zzso
