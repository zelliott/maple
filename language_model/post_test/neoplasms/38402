zzso studies the relationship between genetic zzso and individual responses to zzso In recent years, there has been a great progress in our knowledge of the effects of zzso zzso and molecular target genetic zzso on cancer zzso zzso focuses on the prediction of drug efficacy and toxicity based on a patient's genetic profile with routinely zzso genetic tests to select the most appropriate medication at optimal doses for each individual zzso Two years ago the zzso approved one genetic test to detect patients with increased risk of severe toxicity associated with zzso zzso There have also been zzso genetic chips to zzso two zzso zzso zzso at the same zzso zzso zzso patients based on zzso may identify zzso likely to experience severe toxicity or to derive benefit from a particular treatment strategy, helping us move toward the ultimate goal of individualized zzso In this review, we describe the clinical effects of zzso that may influence cancer zzso
