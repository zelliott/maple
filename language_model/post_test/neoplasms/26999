Over recent years, with the advances in next-generation sequencing, a large number of cancer zzso have been identified and accumulated in public zzso zzso to this is our increased ability to generate detailed zzso maps that help to enrich our knowledge of the biological implications of cancer zzso As a result, network analysis approaches have become an invaluable tool to predict and interpret zzso that are associated with zzso survival and zzso Our understanding of cancer mechanisms is further enhanced by mapping protein structure information to such zzso Here we review the current zzso for zzso the functional impacts of cancer zzso which range from analysis of protein structures to zzso interaction network zzso
