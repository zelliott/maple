zzso zzso zzso is an attractive zzso target because of its vital role in DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso DNA repair zzso is critical for the repair of DNA zzso breaks and zzso zzso leads to a dependency on zzso DNA repair mechanisms, with zzso zzso instability and zzso zzso zzso defects may be exploited through a synthetic lethal approach for the application of zzso zzso including zzso zzso This theory proposes that targeting genetically defective tumor cells with a specific molecular therapy that zzso its synthetic lethal gene partner should result in selective tumor cell zzso The demonstration of zzso zzso activity and the wide therapeutic index of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso carriers with advanced zzso provide strong evidence for the clinical application of this zzso Emerging data also indicate that zzso zzso may be effective in sporadic zzso bearing zzso zzso supporting a substantially wider role for zzso zzso Drugs targeting this zzso are now in pivotal clinical trials in patients with sporadic zzso In this article, the evidence supporting this zzso synthetic lethal strategy with zzso zzso is zzso evolving resistance mechanisms and potential molecular zzso zzso zzso are discussed, and the future development of these agents is zzso
