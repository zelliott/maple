The tolerance level of normal zzso which is the concept of zzso is the limiting factor in radiation zzso It is well known that the two parallel opposing fields should be treated at each session instead of alternating one field per zzso The zzso effect ratios between the normal tissue at the depth of maximum zzso and the zzso for parallel opposing fields were published by zzso et zzso General zzso are now presented providing zzso effect ratio at any two locations in terms of per cent depth doses in the treatment volume for parallel opposing zzso Examples at the depth of maximum zzso and certain depth of the zzso tissue at the tumor site are also zzso
