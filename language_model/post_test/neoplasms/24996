The hallmark of zzso zzso is their spread into zzso tissue and zzso to distant zzso which can lead to life threatening zzso One of the defining characteristics of aggressive zzso is an unstable zzso including the formation of invasive fingers and zzso observed both in zzso and in zzso In spite of extensive zzso clinical and zzso study and research at physical scales ranging from the molecular to the zzso the driving dynamics of zzso zzso are not completely zzso partly because it is challenging to observe and study cancer as a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been applied to provide further insights into these complex invasive and zzso zzso zzso a solid zzso as an zzso fluid, we consider three possible zzso relations to describe zzso growth, namely zzso law, zzso law and the combined zzso zzso We study the zzso zzso stability described by each model and evaluate the consistency between theoretical model predictions and experimental data from in zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso The analysis reveals that the zzso model is the most consistent with the experimental zzso and that it predicts our experimental zzso growth is marginally zzso We further show that it is feasible to extract zzso values from a limited set of data and create a zzso zzso framework that can be extended to the zzso study of zzso
