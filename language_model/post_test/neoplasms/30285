In this review, we present an update on the progress of the Human zzso Atlas, with an emphasis on strategies for zzso zzso protein expression patterns and on the possibilities to extend the map of protein expression patterns for cancer research zzso The objectives underlying the Human zzso zzso include zzso the generation of validated zzso toward a major zzso of all proteins zzso by the human zzso zzso creating an information database of protein expression patterns in normal human zzso in cells, and in cancer, and zzso utilizing generated zzso and protein expression data as tools to identify clinically useful zzso The success of such an effort is dependent on the zzso of zzso as specific zzso of intended targets in applications used to map protein expression zzso The development of strategies to support specific target binding is crucial and remains a challenge as a large fraction of proteins zzso by the human zzso is poorly zzso including the approximately one-third of all proteins lacking evidence of zzso zzso methods for validation include the use of paired zzso zzso two independent zzso targeting different and zzso zzso on the same protein as well as comparative analysis of zzso expression patterns with corresponding zzso
