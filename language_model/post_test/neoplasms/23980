Using a zzso zzso which zzso into the zzso we determined that the rate of zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso Human tumor cell lines, zzso or zzso for zzso had zzso rates zzso greater than primary zzso When zzso cell pairs from tumor cells or primary zzso were zzso differing only in one genetic change which zzso zzso the zzso rate increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by dominant zzso zzso by large T zzso of zzso virus, by E6 protein of human zzso virus, or by genetic deletion led to the same zzso Our results suggest that zzso suppresses spontaneous zzso zzso and that zzso is not required for zzso to zzso The mechanism of zzso suppression may be related to the reported association of zzso with zzso 51, but the functional consequences of this association are not yet zzso It is suggested that suppression of zzso zzso is the means by which zzso maintains genetic zzso
