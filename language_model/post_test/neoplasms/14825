zzso 1, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is a key zzso gene that plays a critical role in the regulation of cell death and survival of various types of zzso However, recent studies have observed that the expression of zzso 1 is altered in certain diseases including zzso The causes underlying the zzso expression of zzso 1 remain largely zzso We report here that zzso zzso a class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules able to affect stability and translation of zzso may represent a previously zzso mechanism for regulating zzso 1 expression and zzso We demonstrated that zzso 1 is a potential target for zzso zzso and this zzso could zzso regulate zzso 1 expression resulting in decreased zzso zzso Treatment of tumor cells with the zzso mimic zzso and with the zzso increased, the expression of zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso confirmed that the zzso binding sequences in the zzso of zzso 1 contribute to the zzso of zzso 1 expression by zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso 1 expression by the zzso mimic blunted zzso of zzso induced by zzso Our study of the role of zzso in regulating zzso 1 expression and zzso reveals a novel function for zzso in a critical cellular event with significant impacts in cancer development, progression and treatment, and in other zzso
