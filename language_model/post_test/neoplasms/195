Human tumor cells and cells from zzso individuals, compared with those from normal individuals, show a significantly higher zzso of zzso breaks and gaps seen in zzso cells immediately after zzso X zzso Previous studies with DNA zzso zzso and DNA repair zzso strongly indicate that the enhancement results from a zzso zzso in DNA zzso We report here zzso evidence for a DNA repair zzso that zzso with the zzso zzso In the alkaline zzso technique, after a pulse label with radioactive zzso in the presence of zzso (a zzso zzso and X zzso DNA from tumor or zzso cells zzso more rapidly during the zzso period than that from normal zzso These results indicate that the DNA of tumor and zzso cells either repairs more slowly or acquires more breaks than that of normal zzso breaks can accumulate during incomplete or deficient repair zzso The kinetic difference between normal and tumor or zzso cells in DNA zzso repair reaches a maximum within 2 zzso and this maximum zzso to the kinetic difference in zzso aberration zzso following X zzso reported zzso These findings support the concept that cells showing enhanced zzso zzso zzso are deficient in DNA zzso The findings could also lead to a zzso zzso for cancer zzso
