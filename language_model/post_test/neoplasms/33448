zzso zzso zzso is a functional imaging technique that displays information about the extent and direction of random water motion in zzso Water movement in zzso is modified by interactions with zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides information on zzso zzso tissue zzso and the integrity of cellular zzso Images can be sensitive to large or small zzso of water, therefore, zzso water flows and microscopic water zzso in the zzso space can be zzso zzso and clinical data indicate a number of potential roles of zzso in the characterization of zzso including determination of zzso aggressiveness and monitoring response to zzso This Review outlines the biological basis of observations made on zzso and describes how zzso are acquired and zzso and discusses the interpretation of images and limitations of the zzso The strength of evidence for adoption of zzso as a zzso for the assessment of tumor response is zzso
