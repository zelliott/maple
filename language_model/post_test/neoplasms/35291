Green tea zzso have been extensively studied as cardiovascular disease and cancer zzso agents in zzso and in animal zzso However, the effects of green tea consumption in humans remain zzso 

To investigate the associations between green tea consumption and zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso National Health Insurance zzso zzso a zzso prospective cohort study initiated in 1994 among zzso Japanese adults aged 40 to 79 years without history of stroke, coronary heart disease, or cancer at zzso Participants were followed up for up to 11 years zzso for zzso mortality and for up to 7 years zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all zzso 

Over 11 years of follow-up zzso rate, zzso zzso participants died, and over 7 years of follow-up zzso rate, zzso zzso participants died of cardiovascular disease and zzso participants died of zzso Green tea consumption was zzso associated with mortality due to all causes and due to cardiovascular zzso The inverse association with zzso mortality was stronger in women zzso zzso zzso for interaction with zzso In men, the zzso hazard ratios of mortality due to all causes associated with different green tea consumption zzso were zzso zzso for less than 1 zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for 1 to 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 3 to 4 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for 5 or more zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso The corresponding data for women were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso for zzso The inverse association with cardiovascular disease mortality was stronger than that with zzso zzso This inverse association was also stronger in women zzso zzso zzso for interaction with zzso In women, the zzso hazard ratios of cardiovascular disease mortality across increasing green tea consumption categories were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso for zzso Among the types of cardiovascular disease zzso the strongest inverse association was observed for stroke zzso In contrast, the hazard ratios of cancer mortality were not significantly different from zzso in all green tea categories compared with the zzso zzso 

Green tea consumption is associated with reduced mortality due to all causes and due to cardiovascular disease but not with reduced mortality due to zzso
