In a pilot study, we evaluated the efficacy and the safety of zzso a new zzso with zzso activity against both zzso and zzso bacteria, as empirical zzso for 108 zzso episodes in 84 zzso cancer zzso zzso (2 g zzso was given for a minimum of 7 days or until resolution of zzso Of the 108 episodes, 91 were zzso zzso documented infections occurred in 25 patients zzso (18 zzso 7 zzso of whom 18 had zzso zzso was clinically documented in 47 patients zzso and fever was unexplained in 19 zzso Overall, zzso zzso of the infections zzso Response rates were zzso zzso for zzso infections, zzso zzso for zzso infections zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for clinically documented infections and zzso zzso for unexplained zzso Of the 26 patients zzso whose primary infections did not improve with zzso zzso 23 responded after the addition of other zzso Sixteen patients zzso developed secondary infections of which 13 were zzso zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from seven patients, zzso bacteria from two, zzso from three and a virus from zzso zzso effects were mild and did not require premature zzso of therapy except for one patient who developed an immediate allergic reaction after the first dose of zzso from which he recovered zzso The survival rate after resolution of zzso was zzso three patients died of primary bacterial infection and one from secondary zzso zzso In this pilot study, zzso zzso appeared safe and effective as empirical therapy for fever in cancer patients with zzso Whether zzso is superior to other zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso infections will require evaluation in a larger comparative zzso
