Even though zzso zzso is one of the oldest zzso drugs, its use in cancer chemotherapy continues to zzso zzso is a zzso that requires zzso zzso to exert its zzso This makes it difficult to associate blood drug concentration with cell toxicity directly, although data from the literature show the existence of such a zzso The relationship between zzso zzso and patient response has been explored extensively and reports attest a link between systemic drug exposure and response and zzso This has led to the concept of zzso tolerated exposure, and strategies to achieve this rely on zzso follow-up and individual dose zzso More than zzso of the administered zzso dose is eliminated by zzso through zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is found in most zzso but is highest in the zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso are used to monitor clinically zzso zzso A zzso but weak correlation between zzso and liver zzso activity has been zzso The relationship between zzso activity and zzso systemic clearance is weak zzso zzso zzso thus, simply determining zzso is not sufficient to predict accurately zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified patient zzso that influence zzso zzso drug zzso is significantly reduced by increased age, high serum alkaline zzso length of drug infusion, and low zzso zzso of zzso metabolism also is zzso zzso of zzso activity was observed after zzso administration in both zzso cancer patients and an animal zzso zzso zzso in zzso activity is suggested from both human and animal zzso In patients receiving protracted low dose zzso infusion, the zzso rhythm in zzso plasma concentration zzso at zzso and is lowest at zzso on zzso The inverse relationship observed between the zzso profile of zzso plasma concentration and zzso activity in these same patients suggests a link between zzso activity and zzso zzso The impact of the biological time of drug administration was also studied with short zzso zzso clearance was zzso greater at zzso than at zzso Similarly, peak drug concentration occurred in the first half of the night in patients receiving constant rate zzso infusion for zzso Several studies describe wide zzso variation in the timing of the peak and trough of the zzso rhythm in zzso zzso The rational for zzso zzso therapy has been the zzso rhythm in host drug zzso which is greatest during the night time when the proliferation of normal target tissue is zzso A zzso study of zzso zzso therapy with zzso delivery rate at zzso was shown clearly to be significantly more effective and less toxic than control flat zzso zzso Future research must focus on zzso markers of specific rhythms to zzso the zzso zzso zzso
