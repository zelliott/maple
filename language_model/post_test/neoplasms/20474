zzso of zzso fumes is potentially zzso to zzso 

We conducted a study of zzso male workers exposed to zzso in road zzso asphalt mixing and zzso zzso ground and building construction workers zzso to zzso and zzso workers not zzso as zzso workers, from Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, with mortality follow-up during zzso We calculated standardized mortality ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso based on national mortality zzso zzso zzso analyses compared mortality of zzso workers to that of building or ground construction zzso 

The overall mortality was below expectation in the total cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in each group of zzso The zzso of lung cancer was higher among zzso workers zzso zzso zzso zzso than among workers in ground and building construction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the internal comparison, the relative risk zzso of lung cancer mortality among zzso workers was zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of cancer of the head and neck were similar to those of lung cancer, based on a smaller number of zzso There was no suggestion of an association between employment in zzso jobs and other zzso 

European workers employed in road zzso asphalt mixing and other jobs zzso exposure to zzso fume might have experienced a small increase in lung cancer mortality risk, compared to workers in ground and building zzso However, exposure assessment was limited and zzso from exposure to zzso in other industries, tobacco smoking, and other lifestyle factors cannot be ruled zzso
