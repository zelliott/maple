Insight into the biology of tumor formation is provided by studies which demonstrate through the use of zzso markers that some tumors have a zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso proposed to use the proportion of zzso tumors among the tumors that are either zzso or pure and of the minority marker type as a lower bound on the marginal fraction of zzso zzso Generally, zzso ratio does not provide a valid lower bound for the marginal zzso zzso as we demonstrate by analyzing relevant conditional zzso zzso of the zzso fraction requires modeling assumptions on the distribution of the number of involved zzso Using three elementary models, we develop maximum likelihood zzso of the zzso zzso We establish zzso of our estimates to zzso of the zzso process, though the estimates are sensitive to assumptions about zzso zzso On data from several published studies, our estimates of the zzso fraction are substantially smaller than zzso zzso
