zzso zzso zzso access ports zzso are valuable medical devices for long-term intravenous treatment such as zzso nutrition, cancer chemotherapy or zzso zzso zzso and use of these devices are each associated with infectious or mechanical zzso 

To determine the frequency of complications and to analyze bacterial contamination of different parts of zzso zzso zzso internal zzso of the zzso 

Clinical charts of patients, which zzso was removed between April 20th to December 31st 2003, were zzso zzso zzso complications zzso and zzso and zzso complications zzso zzso zzso drug zzso were defined using clinical and/or zzso zzso zzso culture from different parts of the zzso was zzso 

One hundred and ten patients (age 57 zzso zzso zzso zzso were included, corresponding to zzso zzso zzso had one or more zzso complications zzso zzso zzso for 1000 zzso Among the 49 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso accounted for zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso patients zzso had an infectious complication: 11 were local and 14 were systemic zzso zzso zzso for 1000 zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso were zzso negative zzso (N zzso zzso zzso zzso susceptible to zzso (N zzso zzso zzso (N zzso 1), zzso (N zzso 1) or zzso zzso (N zzso zzso zzso of quantitative culture of the different parts of zzso with a threshold at zzso zzso showed that culture of tip, zzso and port has a sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively and a specificity of zzso zzso and zzso respectively for the diagnosis of zzso zzso 

zzso associated to zzso are frequent but zzso that we have reported is comparable with previous zzso Analysis of internal zzso of the port is the most sensitive method for the diagnosis of zzso zzso
