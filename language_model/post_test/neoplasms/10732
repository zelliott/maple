zzso zzso is a major barrier to effective cancer diagnosis and zzso We recently identified zzso zzso zzso regions zzso in colon cancer, which also distinguish normal tissue types from each other, suggesting that these zzso might be generalized across cancer zzso Here we show zzso zzso variation of the same zzso distinguishing cancer from normal zzso in zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso tumors, with intermediate variation in zzso zzso zzso sequencing shows these variable zzso are related to loss of sharply zzso zzso boundaries at zzso zzso Furthermore, we find zzso of discrete blocks encompassing half the zzso with extreme gene expression zzso Genes associated with the zzso and large blocks are involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We suggest a model for cancer involving loss of zzso stability of zzso zzso zzso that zzso increased zzso zzso in cancer that may contribute to tumor zzso
